is entitled power and prayer amen amen amen amen God bless your Saints I just have a testimony before the song I'll try and make it short but Saturday after the meeting I when I went home I was getting ready for bed and I started to get this sharp pain on my right hip I was like Lord I am too young for arthritis so what is this pain and I said you know what pain has come before and has gone so I placed some patches on my hip to try and see if that'll ease it and I just prayed and I went to bed and I woke up Sunday morning and I was completely immobilized I could not move and I was like Lord help me Jesus and I started praying and I fell back asleep and I dreamed I called the pasta and I told him everything that's going on with me and he prayed with me and in my dream I'm thinking that this is real and I'm up and about and I'm walking not to realize I woke up and I'm still in bed and I can't move so I said Lord I need a touch I really need a touch I'm not going in any ER I know prayer works so I was in two minds I'm like brother Steven's getting ready for his so man I can't call the pasta and talk to him no so I said I'll just send him a text and I said I need help and I just want to see God move and work for me I came to church it was hard getting ready because I was like Lord I'ma take on that uh attitude like John Ryan and thank you Lord for healing me and that's what I I did to try and get ready for church and I came and I was in so much pain I heard brother John pray for brother Mike who got pain in his knee and I'm standing there I'm like Lord if they only know I can't move so I said Jesus I just need your touch and when I got home actually we went to visit sister coast and she was testifying with me that she was in the same pain as I was probably around the same time and I was like look at the enemy trying to attack us right and today I could jump and Skip and move and there is not a memory of the pain in my head so I know that there is power in prayer amen [Music] [Applause] [Music] some just see someone down on their knees talking to the air words lost on a breeze [Music] falling to the floor just a waste of time not anything more but it's a Time [Music] where you can find someone who cares and if you need some proof I can tell you there is power power in prayer I can tell you about the time the lord gave me peace troubles all around but he calmed the storm in me I remember right now he saved my soul yeah some helps her downs but I know that I know that I know [Music] yes it is where you can find someone stairs and if you need some proof I can tell you again there is power power in prayer [Music] he's always listening and that won't change none so don't waste its moment to call on his neck time [Applause] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] There Is Power in prayer oh if you need some proof I can show you there is power power in Praise [Music] there is power I pray amen amen amen when we go on our knees [Music]

am I going to know I'm a child of the Lord don't worry we will get there amen but you're not here by any chance you're not standing for this message by any chance if you can think about it you continue darling it will take you to Hallelujah Avenue and before you know it you find yourself in heaven so you're not here by any chance the footsteps up there is water do you think the Lord will order you to hell he already went to hell so that I cannot even go to hell amen glory to God everything will be all right amen we're not like you that I get Justified sanctify and we come from

glory to God come on sister glory to God Amen [Laughter] we a church that believe in the moving of the holy spirit so let her move on she's just home and welcome home dear blessed be the name of the Lord amen so you continue to pray for me because I could not touch what I was trying to get on on way on a Sunday so we stopped where the boss wanted me to stop it's a very difficult subject so you pray for me so we can enter there amen then you will appreciate God and you will see that salvation is beyond Who You Are amen whatever you are here have nothing to do with your salvation Salvation is way way way way way way up there amen even if you were born in in the prison [Music] even if you were born in prison the difference is what is inside as long as what is inside come from up there when the big magnet come he's actually not really pulling you he's pulling the you that is inside amen amen have you do you know a very a big magnitude put it in a cup and you get a big magnet on the side and you start moving the magnet like this what do you see the the other one inside doing and when they move what does the cup do so when the pulling the everybody okay this is the water that water is the magnet when there is a big ice here sucking the water what is going to happen to the bottom they are pulling the water but actually there is no way to separate the water from the barrel that's how you're going to find yourself going up amen God is actually sucking his seed up and when the sad and and as he's pulling the seed you and the seed are one so there is no way you can stay there and by the fact before you even meet him he does some plastic surgery amen whatever is damage in your body he repairs everything and make you look younger and beautiful then you can meet your master with that spot and who is that oh my God you already traveled my brother you can feel her pulling amen glory glory brother Sean Martin is having his um Sprint tent meeting coming up in April and I put here

Abraham will be here so you know what to do amen you know what to do amen glory to God question and answer is for this Saturday uh it was it was meant to be at 2 30 but I believe all of you have seen the text message so at two o'clock is better so we can start sharp and start climbing quickly amen so I got my last question tonight so you pray for me everything will be okay but God's grace and we will be moving on for the music I will wait till I got a second date so we can move on part two of Music amen I believe it was a blessing and now we're coming back to the Heart of Worship and it's all about that's all whatever you sing in Praises or worship everything it's all about him if it's not directed to him the motive is wrong the objective is wrong and it's not going to do anything but if it's directing toward him then that's it then he can inhabit the Praises of his people Psalm 47 verse 1 says what clap your hand all you wanted so let's clap [Music] it is that safe for the Lord that saved the scripture we're clapping the hand for Jesus Christ amen glory to God I am not preaching tonight thank God I got big helpers because I have a big load and a long waiting list of interviews coming up so God be blessed that I got Brothers left and right that are there to support and to be a tremendous blessing for the Bride of Jesus Christ he has a home in Hickory but when he is a little behind the town he got a second home so he got two homes there is nothing wrong about having two homes so he got two homes the primary home is a hickory amen and we love it right there but when he's outside the town he's venturing a little bit welcome brother Aaron only believe oh leave believe on Lee believe all things are possible [Music] [Applause] always [Music] [Applause] [Music] savior [Music] oh thank you Lord of things [Music] do you believe that tonight if you believe it raise your hand and say Lord I believe for my blessing Lord I believe for my healing I believe for my need let's pray Heavenly Father we are asked to believe we don't have to do anything Lord because you gave us an unconditional Covenant Lord by two unmutable things that you cannot lie and you swore by yourself and you say I Will Bless Abraham and not only Abraham but also he sit after him Lord we are we have here the sons of Ibraham we have the daughters of Ibrahim some of them are pinned down by sickness some of them have been down lower by the Demons of laodicia by things that fly around father we are asking for your blessing Lord we are asking for your healing touch we're asking for your power for father we know that if you are here wearing this suit standing here tonight you would not heal anyone you say I always healed you already only believe we thank you Father for we ask believing and we know who receive for if we ask anything in your name believing we know that we will receive from you we thank you Father we commit now the ministration of your word into your hands are father knowing that father this is the most sacred Tower Lord for there is no other highest form that you can speak to man than outside of this poor Peter and you come father and you are the power of your anointing and Lord Minister your words your bride we thank you tonight Lord we are just eunuchs there is nothing for for us to give your children but come Lord and break the bread of life we thank you for this church we thank you for brother Stephen we thank you for the elders in Jesus Christ name we pray amen God bless you friends you may have your seats thank you so much musicians we we enjoy the ministry of musicians when when children are hungry they eat from from the dustbins if musicians don't sing people might find inappropriate music but if the musicians are on the Apostles of Duty then there is no excuse to fit somewhere else amen because there is bread there is gifts in the body of Christ and I wish I was a singer but I'm not a sick because a musician can use three minutes things that I'll preach for three hours Aina and when we get on the other side I don't know maybe that's a question for brother Stephen maybe my job will expire on the other side of New Jerusalem but the musicians will still be singing [Applause] there's a permanent contract some of us you know we are hourly workers you know we come and we go but musicians and they don't have a requirement you know they're just they're just getting the spirit and they sing so we we appreciate a lot from musicians I know the devil likes to attack them because it's jealous but but we pray for them all the time amen I I I bring greetings from my wife I think she is in the back with the with the child I'm so I'm sure you're sorry running around the church no she doesn't do that everywhere but she felt at home so she was running around [Applause] amen so I feel like I spent so much time in this church but I've got a quote for that you know brother Brigham used to spend a lot of time in brother's sister had his rights home you know because sister Haiti was the caliber of Elijah amen and the prophet says Elijah spent a lot of time with the weed of zeraphat because she was the caliber of Elijah Jezebel was not the caliber of Elijah but the weed of zaraphat was the caliber of Elijah amen so so Elijah does not hurt women you find many times in the Bible Elijah spending time with the shulamite woman but she spent time with the right caliber praise the Lord so when I'm here I am home and we love brother Stephen so much yeah we believe that is a real gift to the body of Christ if I can preach half of what he does I'm sure I'll be a tremendous let's say amen let's stand and read our Bibles otherwise you'll be here all night amen Let's uh read from Zechariah Chapter 9 verse 16. I love the book of Zechariah when I was young when I was in high school reading my Bible I used to like Zechariah because it was short he said when I was young I thought like ice long in German but at least the Zechariah is short you know but when I grew up I loved Isaiah I loved Ezekiel but I still like Zechariah too chapter 9 verse 16 the Bible says and the Lord their God shall save them in that day as the flock of his people yes for they shall be as stones of a crown lifted up as an end sign upon his land I mean an enzyme is a standard it's a it's a banner praise the Lord like in the Old Testament they they used to assemble in groups of four you know there was a standard of the North in the standard of the South and the East and the west and one was an ego the ox you know you know those things and that's an enzyme amen so he says I Shall Serve them for they shall be a stones of a crown you may have your seats praise the Lord so for for a short time today I try not to bring a very long inspiration because on a midweek service you might not have time to balance everything amen so we'll try to that's the being a traveling Minister you have to preach everything and finish but uh brother Stephen can tuck the breast and laugh a firm part one to part 15. [Laughter] so but then we are like you know flight attends and we just give you a few meals and then you go and then you enjoy your food at home so we prepare picked lunches so to say but here in Zechariah I love Zechariah because Zechariah the Bible says that when they were building the Temple they they prevailed through the pre to the prophet sign of Zechariah of haggai and all the different prophets and the Bible says says Israel trust in the Lord and you shall be established believe His prophets and you shall prosper amen if you believe God's Prophet that's where your blessing is you every nation that ever prospered was because they received God's prophets you talk about uh Germany is the most industrialized country in Europe the biggest economy in Europe because they're the Revival by Martin Luther King praise the Lord and not not Luther King but Martin Luther amen under justification and the prophet says civilization travels with the gospel amen you talk about England you are such a Powerhouse because it gave us many ministers like John Wesley like you know all these those good ones you know them you know saying Patrick and different ones and here in the United States we have had wonderful wonderful men of God so you see that Civilization and blessings they travel with the word of God amen and the reason why in Africa we were a little bit slower is because it took time for the gospel to really penetrate praise the Lord because civilization travels with the gospel that's what the prophet says amen so in Zechariah he sings that that they shall be as stones of a crown amen so God is talking about his people that they shall be as a stones of a crown now this is not just an ordinary crown this is the crown of my Lord Jesus Christ and if you know anything about clowns they don't put Granite stones in in in in in crowns they put diamonds they put rubies they put emeralds they put the most precious stones in crowns so that that the storm that will be in the crown of Jesus they are not cheap Stones it's precious strongs it's Diamond Stones and I am looking at some of them tonight Hallelujah praise be to God Jesus Christ is glorified by his people he is glorified with his people Hallelujah he says father glorify me with the glory that we had before the foundation of the world when Jesus Christ was glorified we were glorified with him we existed in him before the foundation of the world because there is only one form of eternal life if you are Eternal tonight you will always Eternal with God Hallelujah praise be to God you receive the Holy Ghost but you actually always had the Holy Ghost but you didn't know it you say brother Aaron what about me my brother how do I know I am the one if you are thinking like that then you are the one because if you are not the one you don't think like that Hallelujah praise be to God because Jesus Christ when he said one of who is going to betray me the elect were like Lord is its Niche is it me Lord is it me Lord but Judas was quiet Hallelujah if you are wondering Lord you have the Holy Ghost you have the Holy Ghost [Applause] Hallelujah thank you [Applause] I don't want to get into the private interview with sister Bruce says brother from do I have the Holy Ghost and the prophet says yes you have the Holy Ghost [Applause] the Holy Ghost sensation the Holy Ghost is the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is not a Time the Holy Ghost is the Holy Ghost [Applause] praise be to God Hallelujah so they shall be as the stones of a crown lifted up as an as a standard in other words the Believers the other standard for their days we are not copying the world we are not copying the denominations but we understand that for the world we are the standard for the church hallelujah it's an Abomination for a Son of God to be following the world for a Son of God to be following the more abides and repairing site and the e-fights a Son of God is a standard oh praise be to God says Timothy let no man despise thy youth but be thou a standard of the Believers not a standard to the Believers of the Believers what it means is that you are representing the Believers if people see you out there they see spoken word Tabernacle when you are talking they see spoken word up and Echo there's this words you are an example of the flock Hallelujah lift up the standards lift up the standard what is your standard tonight it's Jesus Christ because every remember when they were camping each one had to have a standard amen and our standard is the ego because we have received the ego message Hallelujah we fly above we fly above the world we fly above America because we have received the anointing of an eagle Hallelujah that's the standard that we have received in this age I have no power to correct what the prophets gave I have no qualification to correct what Elijah gave her my duties to give you the standard and the standard is perfect if if you are a police officer it's not your duty to decide whether the law is right or not if you're a police officer your duty is to apply the law stop your over speeding the court says this that's what the ministry does we are not there to try Congress sets the laws we just give you what it means praise the be to God Hallelujah so God says here he says the prophet says right in the presence of this of his being tonight in his sight we are already glorified those who he justifies yes past tense glorified and what makes you a Christian is because Lord you and long for that perfect is because the Perfection is laying right out there that had a glorified body Hallelujah so so God wanted to make Jewels for himself and this Jew house he is picking them up but he is not picking them up and transforming them to be Jewels they are already Jews he is only checking what is not too well out Hallelujah praise be to God is only taking what is not the Holy Ghost in shoe that's what he's simply doing whatever is not the word that's what is taking out [Applause] [Music] amen Revelations 21 verse 14 the Bible says and the war of the city had 12 foundations and in them the names of the Apostles of the lamp amen people say you worship a man what about this verse it didn't say the names of of Jesus Christ says the names of the Apostles of the Lamb so you have to give respect where respect is true amen and he that talked with me had a golden Reed Sunday School gold represents amen God bless you Amen to measure the city so the city is not measured by a theologian it's not measured by a seminary it's measured by a golden Reed by God himself by Divine vindication Hallelujah I believe that through God we have a perfect interpretation of the Bible by Divine vindication amen says Intercity and the gates and the wars thereof amen I'm building a foundation amen so there's a city they are Gates and they are Wars a perfect type of the restoration of Israel there was Ezra there was Nehemiah and there was a rubber Bell amen remember there were three decrees amen at a sexist Cyrus and the other one amen and the prophet when he's preaching the 70 weeks he specifies the the the decree from where we count the 70 weeks because they are three of them Hallelujah so it takes a prophet to tell you where you are and where you are going Hallelujah if you are lost and I give you a map you can't find home until someone tells you where you are on the map if you go to the mall if there's a more there's a map here is not strong here is where you find food here is where you you have this shop this is where you find and the map will be there and there will be a sign that says you are here so the prophet he tells you sure she and then we start from there Hallelujah you cannot interpret a dream before you see the Dream First Hallelujah so the prophet is to say the dream first and he says and they say from here you're going there Hallelujah so so there are three degrees there is Ezra there is a prince from the tribe of Judah amen representing the king amen part of this restoration and Ezra reveals the temple and he brings worship representing the Levites and then you have if Nehemiah was with the governors so it should a perfect restoration under Malachi 4 you cannot ignore the five-fold ministry because they are part of the restoration of worship Hallelujah you need zaruba Bell you need Ezra Nehemiah you need all of them Hallelujah so now this this Temple it represents the bride because the Bible says I saw it comes from heaven like a pride and the prophet takes his time to preach about it in future home and this Jerusalem was built by stones and the stones are not just ordinary stones the Bible talks about the precious stones that built the New Jerusalem I mean it and it names them I'll I'll read them you know in a little while these stones are representing the Believers because every believer is a stoner in the kingdom of heaven and Everest every stone has to fit its place Hallelujah and every stone is different some stones are green some stones are diamonds some stones are arubis some are blue some are shallow but they are all precious stones some are preachers some are singers are some are deacons are but they are all sons of God Hallelujah and the value of the Stone does not come from its quantity it comes from its character Hallelujah because God does not count his people he weighs them he waste them that's what the prophet says he said built a chance that you have been you have been waiting the balance and you have been found one thing hey man Hallelujah so diamonds you don't say my ring is Four Diamonds no you say it's 18 carats it's sick it's 16 carats that's the value of a diamond you don't say well I belong to this church I belong to that church as you a Christian [Applause] 18 carats 21 carats [Music] Hallelujah and the prophet says must one dollar and lot was 20 cents don't look down on Lots he's a brother but he's 20 cents how many cars are you tonight I believe I'm talking to hundreds carrots tonight raise me to God so God does not count his people you waste them because God said to Abraham if I find ten that I can wave I won't destroy sorrow God said if I can find 10 righteous people I won't destroy Sodom because the weight of 10 righteous people can can overshadow the wickedness of Sodom the weight of one belief in a family can overshadow the sins of the whole family the weight of one believer in the company can stop a company from collapsing one name Joseph sustained each Egypt a superpower oh come on Church it takes one person for God to bring an innovation he doesn't want 10 people he wants one man with a Crooked Stick where are you going Moshe sir I'm going to take over I'm going to take over because it's about the weight not the number Hallelujah but the world is about numbers oh I've got 15 000 likes so what amen I've got 8 000 followers saw what so what [Applause] you know my Instagram post I got anyone likes so what God looks at the weight not the number one time he said to the prophet you are walking with too many people for me to work with you anyway let me not go there hey man you look at character if you're a young man you want to marry you look at character if you're a young lady you want to get married you look at character [Applause] you don't look at the car that is driving you don't look at the suit that is wearing should look at his character you look at your character amen so God when he's making these shoes these are made by pressure oh come on Friends what makes a diamond it's pressure what makes a diamond is Trials are is sickness oh come on Friends [Applause] diamonds [Music] they say diamonds a hundred percent carbon minerals hundred percent accretion is hundred percent the word 100 spoken word [Music] you are a Christian at home you're a Christian Network you are clean on your WhatsApp on your Facebook you are a Christian hundred percent the world [Applause] Hallelujah that's what makes a diamond a diamond is so hot there is nothing that can cut your diamonds except another diamond there is nothing that can harm you unless God's permits it foreign [Music] if you're a single sister you say you know what I'm a diamond it'll only take another Diamond to get this diamonds [Applause] if you're a young man don't devalue yourself say I'm a diamond and I'll dwell with a diamond [Applause] [Music] have you ever seen an eagle marrying a buzzard or a person no sir Eagles merry Eagles diamonds dwell with diamonds are Angelic beings associated with one another [Applause] [Music] hey man the prophet says just as Solomon's Temple was cut out of all the world one block was cut this way and one was cut that way remember we are cut different one is a teacher one is an evangelist this one is a pastor one is this but we are all making once one building the house of God don't expect everyone to be like you don't expect everyone to be like you neither should you try to become like everyone be yourself God catch you like that don't betray yourself be yourself brother Brown says I hate to see people disfigure themselves trying to be what they ain't that's what the prophet says laughs Hallelujah be yourself God made me an African I'm a happy African Oh Glory [Applause] Hallelujah some people feel like you know I'll say I Mrs preacher you have to be going out hunting not all of us you have to go out hunting unfortunately there's no scripture for that all of us have to believe the word because I have seen them with Mr guns and they still breaks light I've seen them it's all about hunting and having guns it's about following the words say oh brother I've got this I've got this you know I you know it's not about that the spirit of Elijah is not to impersonate Elijah is to become like him in the spirit [Applause] hey man Revelation 21 says and the 12 gates there were 12 pearls every several gate was of one pile and the street and the streets of the city was pure gold as it was transparent gold so these these were made of pearls amen the prophet saying that these thoughts they came from different places when they were building the Temple of Solomon and there was a song that sister meet I used to sing they come from the East and West they come from the land of far amen like some of you here remember when the prophet was preaching the future home he says the size of the city is like from Georgia to Maine just like people represented Jesus Hallelujah some came from the Congo some came from Greece some come from the Irish but they are all making one house of God thank you [Applause] amen that's what makes spells it's pressure if you take wood just take it to a certain temperature and then you know that's it you take a granite Stone just put it you know in a certain just a little pressure it falls apart but you take a diamond you know like for example there's a metal called titanium just to give you context that's what they use to make the engines of the airplane it can fly for 24 hours it will never overheat because of the current of that metal amen so God is not interested in just picking all stones he wants believers who can stand firm in the face of trials in the face of sickness in this in the face of of of of smoking amen if you read Hebrews chapter 11. oh my God the Bible says by faith they were Sona Sanda he didn't say they were so understand that because they didn't have faith it says by faith Hallelujah by faith they were fed to lions by faith amen that's what makes it a masterpiece [Applause] but in laodicia we think faith is living in Wonderland no sir when you don't have money and you still come to church by faith when your house is upside down and you still come to church that's faith when you lose your job when you come to church that's safe [Applause] when you walk for five miles to come to church that's right [Applause] that's the faith that was once delivered to the Saints amen but in laudishia it's a twisted Faith something is wrong they think faith is everything is perfect really there's no such thing as that God if you there is I'll tell you it's not Bible amen it's not Bible everyone has a cross we all come through there's some some through the flood some through the fire but all through the blood God brings his children along when tires come in your life don't say oh I wish I was like brother Aaron you don't know what I'm going through should have no idea what I'm going through if we're to exchange trials you say I think I'm good I think I'm good Hallelujah sometimes you see a Mr coming up here you say oh they've got all everything all together you don't know the battles that they fight you don't know the sleepless nights the prayers the concern for the flock you don't know all the struggles that you are struggling if you have children you know what I'm talking about if you have five children that's five blessings but they also come with five problems because every time you are worried it's my childhood growing well is he loving the Lord does he understand the Bible that's what keeps you awake at night and if you are a pastor it keeps you awake at night amen praise the Lord Exodus chapter 28 verse 10. six of their names on one stone and the other six names on the rest of other Stone according to their birth now you don't become a Jew unless you are born a Jew you cannot say well I I have joined the the Jewish Community I'm now a Jew no sir if you have if you can only be born a Jew for you to become a Jew I'm talking about natural juice and for you to be a Christian you have to be born a Christian you have to be born again there is no other way of becoming a Christian except by birth that's why a man was asked my friend how did you come in my mind you know my dad was hit the tap on Echo so what how did you come in I know my uncle used to went going hunting with the prophet no that's not what you're asking how did you come in [Applause] no that's not the question how did you come in they say bind his hand and foot and throw him away [Applause] you see some of these people the way they are blaspheming you can see that this one has been bound hand and foot by God himself six of them it says and the other six names according to their birth now the names are according to birth like the prophet saws about Ephraim the mother speaking the name in birth and the position of the place saying that's Child by birth and and Ephraim dwelt by the Sea because that's what his name was talking about like Judah means praise thou at whom thy Brethren shall praise that's why they were praising David so cute a thousand but David killed ten thousand they were praising David because of the name of Judah Hallelujah and so God was instructing these people to make an effort now they were they were there was one stone here and there was one stone there and these Stones there was there was something that was hanging here and it held the aroma from him now the arm of thermometer 12 Stones and on each of the stones were written the names of the tribe of Israel and there's two stones one on the left one on the right six and six just like the shoe bread there were six on the left and six on the right hallelujah praise be to God so so the glory of the efforts contained the names of the tribes of Israel in other words the glory of God you were already glorified with God God cannot be glorified without you you are part of the glory of God [Applause] Hallelujah praise be to God and these Stones I like them two of them were on the shoulders what is the strongest part of a man it is the shoulders and the prophet says he saw a picture of a man who broke the lamp and says he put it on his shoulders that's where Jesus Christ hears you you say oh brother I'm dying I'm going through trials I'm struggling you are on the shoulders of Jehovah just just in the process God knows exactly what he's doing if you go for a surgery and you are lying surgery you don't have to worry why are you taking these scissors why why are you doing why are you talking why are you doing that just rest and wait for the operation to finish and they say congratulations the surgery was successful one of these days Lord will say congratulations the surgery has been successful you might have scars you might have that that praise the Lord anyhow it's been successful [Applause] some of you are gonna work with this class like Jacob but praise the Lord has been successful [Applause] [Music] amen some some of your tooth were too hard to pull and God had to do you know many interviews different methods sometimes God has to make you lose your job for the operation to be successful man if it means breaking you apart you will do that because he is not going to lose any he is not going to give up on any of his flock amen and and these Stones the Bible says that they were they were engraved in gold and gold represents Christ now we are we are like you know the go forward that no head that the government is the weakest wood but you combine with the tide becomes the hardest Like a Rock so it's engraved in time and the devil does not you know he he can't walk against the top because that's crushed let me keep going oh my God Hosea chapter 5 verse chapter 6 verse 5 therefore I have healed them by by the prophets now you cannot use a stone outside of the prophet that's why you've got so many rubbles out there so-called churches because it takes a real mercenary to heal the stones I have slain them by the words of my mouth by thy judgment for I desired Mercy not sacrifice so when God you he healed you from a rock amen the prophet says in the end time evangelism what is what good is the stone if you haven't got a stone muscle to ship it out confession is Stones when Peter made his confession Jesus said thou asked Peter a little Stone so it's a compound meaning the Revelation is the rock but also Peter is a little Stone just like you and me we are little stones amen the stone that killed Goliath it was a special stone it was a predestinated stone and God knew the only thing that would destroy Goliath in this age is the stone of the message exactly predestinated for this hour Revelation chapter 21 verse 18. and the building of the war of it was of Jasper and the city was pure gold like unto clear glass and the foundation of the war of the city were garnished with all men of precious stones the First Foundation was Jasper the second Sapphire and chaldoni and fourth and emerald and the prophet you know we don't have time he says I'm not going to get into the colors of these Stones remember when when John saw him Revelation chapter 4 5 he said he was to look upon his Jasper and sudden and the prophet says it's Reuben and Benjamin in other words those what Jesus Christ was to look upon was actually the church and there was a rainbow amen and you know how they classify these Stones it's if you know some of them they produce rainbows and some of them they don't and these stones that make the New Jerusalem they say they all make rainbows so the rainbow actually comes from the stone so when when John saw Christ with the rainbow now there could not be a rainbow Covenant unless there was something that was lost so it was this stones that produced the rainbow I can prove that by the Bible if you go to the Old Testament the prophet says if a man in the dream you'd go before the urima from him and if the dream was true then it would bring the colors so these colors they come from the stones that are in the urim of tell him oh come on Church if you read Ezekiel chapter one it talks about the glory of God and the prophet talks about them but he talks about the Kara of emerald and amber light you know and there was the Bible says that there was you know living creatures and they they had wheels in the middle of a wheel and they had eyes all over and I like the verse that says and they tend not where they went you know it's like if I'm if I'm if I'm going this direction if I wanna go right I have to stop and turn but these ones because they've got wheels and they have eyes all over they don't turn they tend not where they go if they're going this way they are moving forward if they're going this way they are moving forward if they're going this way they are moving forward if you get sickness you are moving forward if you lose your job you're moving forward if your husband leaves you you are moving forward the prophet says they were representing the church [Applause] they don't stop because we are not of those that turn back we are moving forward God bless you my brother move forward you say brother Aaron my marriage is collapsing move forward my business is corrupted it's collapsing move forward come to church anyhow and praise God [Applause] [Music] he that takes hold of the plow and looks back is not worthy of the Kingdom what did what did what did Elijah say to Elijah says stay here Elijah says no I'm moving forward stay here no I'm moving forward and do you know who discouraged Elijah Elisha it was not the devil It Was Elijah what who who discouraged the sacral finishing woman it was not the devil it was God he was trying his seat Hallelujah he says it is not neat to take the children's bread and toss it to the dogs she didn't go to CNN and say oh there's this religious minister he called a colored woman a dog a breaking news she didn't say that she says yeah Lord I'm a dog yeah Lord I'm a talker oh come on Friends [Applause] I'll rather have the right Spirit the right Doctrine [Applause] [Music] because for you to have a right Spirit you have you need two things you need love and you need humility if you are humble and the word says dog you say yeah Lord whatever the word says about me that's what I am [Applause] she did not try to correct the words Peter tried to correct the words Jesus Christ says all of you are going to deny me you're going to leave me and Peter thoughts you are smart smarter than the word so it's not me Lord I'll go with you everywhere and Jesus Christ that is special issue foreign but if this rock falls upon you it will grind you to powder that's what the scripture says friends [Music] amen Revelation chapter four part two of the prophecies they John stood and he's seen him sitting on the throne he was to look like Jasper and sardine amen now if you notice it Compares with the rest of the scripture he was Alpha and Omega amen it was all gathered in him that's why Paul says when Christ who is our life shall appear in other words we are part of Christ we cannot be lost any more than God can be lost it's impossible it's impossible [Applause] and the prophecies and just for the stone know how these things are came to Jesus he says can you keep put my son on my on the right on the left Jesus said I can't change that program I can't I can't change this program that's how deep this thing is you were not you did not become a Christian yesterday or last year or 10 years ago you were a Christian before the foundation of the world and when you when you hear the word there is a process that is activated and it's an irreversible process because Ecclesiastes says better is the end of the thing that the beginning of which you may see a love for example Aaron I'm just a worm 200 at the end of the process you're gonna be a butterfly at the end of this process you are going to fly like a butterfly you see a worm but glass is a butterfly [Applause] see it says before says rabbi when did you know me before Philip called you before brother Aaron testified to issue before brother gave you the spoken word I saw you when Noah style me Rabbi before the foundation of the world and the prophet says I saw all some of you over there I saw some of you over there oh man says don't despise these little these little ones they're Angels that's the orphanage in heaven always behold the face of my father in other words we are already in heaven Ephesians chapter one [Applause] Hallelujah we are not under the influence of this world we are in this world but we are not of this world we are in laudesia but we are not of ladisha amen to whom coming as unto a living Stone disallow allowed indeed of man but chosen of God and precious when I say God bless you my precious brother I'm just a cliche or you know it's just a it's you it's a precious song and and to show you how precious this is it was purchased by the blood of God how much is the blood of God ji also it's Lively stones just think of if I go out and scratch a brother's car that he bought for maybe fifteen thousand dollars he'll be upset the whole week I mean not a brother but if any any person now but something that was purchased by the blood of God if I ask you to do evaluation and say can you value for me the blood of gods what value can you put it's in finite it's in finite God is willing to give it all for his children she also are Lively stones you are not dead stones you are Lively stones build up spiritual house a holy priesthood offering up spiritual sacrifices that's why we come to church sacrifices Hallelujah there is no religion without sacrifice that's why the prophet says a service is not complete without taking a love offering because sacrifice is part of worship you can't say I'm tired I don't want to go to church you don't know what what what worship is remember anything that is breath can praise the Lord but those that worship him they worship and speak and in truth [Applause] Hallelujah what is the what did God say to the prophets he says for you to bind this number you need to be more sincere you need to come to church more you need to pay your tithe on time for you to bind this man bear Hallelujah it's just when I came when I came out of the vision my finger was pointing on the scripture says not keeping this Feast with the old living and he says you know I live in bread he says it's fasting was that sincerity remember don't forget the Feast of unleavened bread yes it represents Christ but it's also represents a Believer because remember the twelve loves that was the 12 tribes of Israel that was Christ but that was also a shoe because God requires sincerity and one of the things that we have lost in this age is sincerity we have people that like to play games and do barbecue and you know but they are not sincere people the Holy Ghost will never work with the haves that are not sincere Hallelujah that's why when you read the Bible in the Book of Psalms says his Mercy endures forever Selah means stop pause think reflect don't just be saying I'm going to church I mean you know reseller stop [Applause] can I say something are you up to date with the sermon [Applause] God bless you friends all right prayer says he that overcome I will make him a pillar in the temple of my God he shall go no more out what is that if he's a pillar he ain't going out no more I'm gonna cross in a little bit he's the bride that's right in Ephesus Church age Paul taught them in Acts now wait a minute if you're going to be a pillar I had no scriptures down here I wanted to get to before we get to the bride so God is going to say he I'll make him a pillar you see you become a pill or you are established in the foundation of the prophets and the apostles you know just fluricking floating around you are established in the world you shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of Living Water and you bring fruit in your season and the prophet saying that you bring your foot in your own season in other words you're not bringing the food of Luther so are bringing the fruit that is meat for this time that we're living in now the time on the prophets was in South Africa one time and they took him took him to a diamond mine says he says when it comes for it's just a big smooth round like piece of glass it's a blue diamond Black Diamond emerald and clear diamond white diamonds then what what when it's made and put into use there is a part of the diamond has to lose it's a diamond to begin with but a part of it has to lose you were a Son of God to begin with so God is only chipping away what is not that diamond hey man he has to circumcise in the heart Hallelujah says I will write my my laws not upon Stone temp tables but upon the table of their hearts Hallelujah this is why the stones in the they were engraved the names were engraved and this is not a new phenomenon if you read Ezekiel chapter 9. there was an angel with the writer's income and he was told to go in the midst of the people and you are stood to mark amen and why we look at the symbols and the prophet says it represents the Holy Ghost he had a writer's income in other words if he was mocking he was writing something in symbols because when you receive the Holy Ghost you are receiving something praise me to God and you read in Revelations that the 144 000 they had on their foreheads the name of the father and then that's the name of Jesus that's why when when Paul was persecuting the church Christ came down and says born so why are you persecuting me because the whole family in heaven on Earth of God is called Jesus in the realm of the spirits we don't see your name we see Jesus that's what is written on the forehead it's Jesus [Applause] [Music] people that are not properly taught they say oh there's a witchcraft in my family no name we see Jesus not a Christian there's a welcoming Spirit upon you there is a light on you so a Christian oh come on Friends you are not enough but there is a light in your life and the demons they see that light [Applause] when you marry a woman you have the power to change it you're saying them their last name when you are married to Jesus you change your name because I will give you a white stone and there is a name written on the stone that no one knows but sure [Applause] as I call you Mrs Jesus God bless you Mrs Jesus God be with you Mrs Jesus God loves you Mrs Jesus [Applause] Hallelujah don't worry about things don't get deceived by fear demons are actually afraid of you because the prophet says when the weakest player Saints begins to pray the Gates of Heaven Shake because you have the name of Jesus and you have to carry the name by revelation oh come on Friends because remember there are two seals there is the Sea of Christ and there's the Sea of the Antichrist and may we be ready for the Rapture or in the act of safety and you know the arcade three decks and the people they do it on the third deck that's where we are that's where the Prophet left us and on the third pool the opening of the world Amen but the the other animals they are only two Jacks of the Ark baptized in there he says up on the Upper Floor where we can see the light of the Gospel shining and punctuate Every Word Within bless them keep them I claim them for Jews of your crown Lord Jesus Christ let's read Malachi chapter 3 verse 17. oh come on friends you are Jews in the crown of Christ nothing is going to harm you nothing is going to affect you nothing is going to destroy you you were chosen in Hima before the foundation of the world if you are being troubled by demons and witchcraft give them my address write to Jesus Christ purebox heaven that's my address forward them to my address and they shall be mine says the Lord in that day when I make my jewels and I'll spare them as a man's Spirit his own son that sereth me says in the day when I make my Jewels that's what God is doing he's making his jewels the prophets in broken systems he says now my last quote he says I thank thee father they are your jewels and I pray God that tonight that you manifest your way you you manage to face your way yourself in the way to make them that they have need of amen it says uh he said he says he says here he says he says uh he says um I claim them for jewels of for your crown so the souls that the prophet was ministering to says I claim them for jewels of your crown that's why Martin says the Saints shall crown him Lord amen that's why I love the song We Crown you now with many crowns you rain Eternal you reign supreme high and lifted up amen he has made us Kings and Priests to Reign together with him and remember we are inside the city we are sitting together with him on the throne and nothing shall hurt or destroy in all my Holy Mountain this is why the prophet took the Crowbar and he smudged the pyramid and there was a White Rock amen and there was something written that only the prophet could interpret it says brother stay here and that pyramid remember the Capstone is the problem is there's only one son which is both a Capstone and a Cornerstone and that's a pyramid that's the only shape that can fit a Cornerstone and also a what a Capstone and and all of you here you are pyramids you are pyramids hey man you are pyramids here before the Lord and I want to say to you my friends may God bless you richly may God bless you abundantly don't fear anything God is working and work in your life trust in the Lord believe his prophet and you shall prosper let's stand upon our feet foreign [Applause] do you have a need tonight God can give you your need do you have a request tonight God can give you a request God answers prayer God
