[15:52] Sister Rosemary gave a testimony last
[15:55] week about a phone call that she had
[15:57] with someone there uh
[15:59] overseas and uh she texted me back you
[16:03] know she only mentioned five or six
[16:05] months or something like that here but
[16:07] she had spoken to the sister about a
[16:09] specific month I think she texted me
[16:11] back and went back and looked and and
[16:14] and it was exactly like she said it
[16:16] there was no guessing about it and then
[16:19] brother Charles gave me a message this
[16:21] week about uh about it was a preacher
[16:25] preaching about Mark 11 and uh and the
[16:28] squirrels tying those together and also
[16:31] the two witnesses from um
[16:34] Deuteronomy and that thing stayed in my
[16:36] heart all
[16:37] week the the main point was don't
[16:42] overemphasize the power of the spoken
[16:46] word it's the faith that it that it
[16:50] increases through patience after you've
[16:54] spoken it because it was instant the
[16:57] first time with that first squirrel but
[16:59] he actually had two instances of Three
[17:02] Squirrels and so that was a big lesson
[17:05] and it was

[49:44] reading our Bible twice a day one
[49:47] chapter in the morning one chapter
[49:49] before you go to bed someone is reading
[49:51] their cood the church ages the 70 weeks
[49:54] of Daniel the seals are option or
[49:57] somebody's listening to the message of
[49:59] the hour amen you cannot be in this
[50:02] message for 20 years and never read the
[50:04] church
[50:07] ages something is
[50:09] wrong let me repeat it again you cannot
[50:13] be in this message 20 years and you
[50:16] cannot even finish the church ages it
[50:18] means your foundation is
[50:20] [Music]
[50:21] zero amen your foundation is zero in the
[50:25] church ages brother Bram give a
[50:27] scripture and he explain a scripture and
[50:29] you explain and if you take the church
[50:31] ages with the the uh with your Bible and
[50:34] you begin to read side by side you will
[50:37] see how much growth you will have
[50:39] spiritually amen especially sisters
[50:42] nobody say that brothers are the only
[50:44] one listening to the message take that
[50:47] out of this church we are all Sons and
[50:50] Daughters of
[50:52] God Amen so read your church ages read
[50:56] the adoption don't wait for me to give
[50:57] you
[50:58] everything amen I had somebody asking me
[51:02] a question a good question recently I
[51:04] said you go listen to the sermon the
[51:06] future home and the future home got the
[51:08] entire answer in detail if not I will
[51:12] just give I mean uh get a quote and give
[51:14] it and he did and he sent me a message
[51:16] and now he's sending me a message with
[51:18] the
[51:19] answers himself that's the way I want
[51:23] you to be amen you got to read the
[51:26] message message for
[51:28] yourself so when you listening to a
[51:30] preacher you
[51:31] say this is not what brother Bram
[51:36] say amen amen not so and so say HH we
[51:42] want to see where brother Bram
[51:45] say we want to see where the Bible
[51:48] say if the Bible didn't say brother Bram
[51:51] didn't say and you keep it to yourself
[51:54] sh
[51:55] [Laughter]
[51:57] so I will always encourage you listen to
[52:01] the message of brother Brandon amen
[52:04] especially when you
[52:05] single this is the best time to
[52:08] accumulate as much message as you can
[52:11] before you get married and children and
[52:14] diaper and this one is screaming
[52:16] emergency room all this kind of stuff
[52:18] this is the best time for you to
[52:19] accumulate everything that you can
[52:22] because one of these day you will begin
[52:24] to regret you say I wish ahead listen to
[52:28] brother Steven amen so always you drive
[52:31] into your car go ahead and cut that tape
[52:33] on and listen to the message even 20
[52:35] minutes you stop tomorrow 20 minutes
[52:38] tomorrow 20 minutes in 3 days you find
[52:40] out you finish a sermon amen amen you're
[52:44] not too busy I don't know how many are
[52:46] busier than me so if I read the message
[52:48] you should be having more time than me
[52:50] I'm not saying I'm more than you know
[52:52] that's not what I'm saying in other word
[52:54] you should have time right to listen
[52:56] listen to the message amen love is
[53:00] discipline you need that quote
[53:02] again you remember that quote right
[53:05] that's what the prophet say so put your
[53:07] head in the word get your head off from
[53:10] the social media whatever is going on go
[53:13] into the word and listen to the message
[53:15] of the hour
[53:18] amen the young men meeting we're still
[53:21] working on it young Sisters Meeting
[53:23] December 7th Lord's willing question and
[53:26] answer December 14th Lord's willing
[53:29] married couple December
[53:32] 21st same place same time I got more
[53:36] questions in the married couple so I
[53:38] don't know how many session we will take
[53:42] the reason why we keep it back to back
[53:44] is sometime when you start a subject and
[53:46] you wait three month you lose the
[53:48] momentum yes sir amen so when the
[53:50] momentum is there let's just go ahead
[53:52] and deal with this because they are
[53:54] question after question after a question
[53:57] until we get to birth control then we
[53:59] are all of you it's not going to be me
[54:01] and myself we read the Bible and we read
[54:03] brother Bram like we always do all the
[54:06] way until you got your own answer clear
[54:08] and never use my name and say brother
[54:10] Steven say you say brother Bram say and
[54:13] the Bible says amen until somebody ask
[54:16] you who is your pastor and then you can
[54:18] tell my name but if it's not use brother
[54:21] Bram and use the Bible amen am so Lord's
[54:24] willing December the 21st we ride there
[54:27] by God's grace this coming week
[54:31] again remember our service is on Tuesday
[54:36] at 7:30 not on Wednesday if you come on
[54:38] Wednesday you call the Deacon they will
[54:40] open the church you can come in and
[54:42] spend some time praying amen so Tuesday
[54:47] that's when our Thanksgiving services at
[54:49] 7:30 brother John and sister Ed thank
[54:52] you very much for taking care of the
[54:55] young man on the bonfire so somebody
[54:58] took a little load off of me so I say
[55:01] brother John is there he's uh married
[55:03] and uh uh brother Zach is there married
[55:06] brother Chris is there married so they
[55:08] already got three couples there so they
[55:10] don't need me to be there so I can catch
[55:12] up on something else it doesn't mean I
[55:14] didn't want to be there but if I if I
[55:16] have to be everywhere even God have to
[55:19] be in one
[55:22] place you need a court do you need a CT
[55:25] that's brother brandham said the
[55:27] omniscient of God doesn't means god is
[55:30] everywhere that's a Pentecostal
[55:32] understanding God is a man he's a human
[55:35] being he's somewhere but his
[55:38] knowledge is what makes him
[55:41] omnipresent omniscient actually means
[55:44] knowing everything and because he knows
[55:46] everything he looks like he's
[55:48] everywhere amen so by God's grace I am
[55:52] like my
[55:53] maker so I can only be in one place
[55:56] place in one time amen but God can also
[56:00] help us break into a channel and we know
[56:02] what you're doing somewhere in secret
[56:04] and we can tell you you went somewhere
[56:06] and you did this and this and this and
[56:08] this is what happened amen amen so
[56:11] brother John and sister God richly bless
[56:14] you and I trust that you had a wonderful
[56:16] time I saw some picture in the youth

[1:06:04] not in this
[1:06:08] world are we together are we together
[1:06:11] and when we are born we are born into

[1:06:44] world glory to God the Bible says in
[1:06:47] Hebrew
[1:06:49] 11:9 that by what
[1:06:52] sa not by intellect
[1:06:55] by Revelation by faith what happened he
[1:06:59] sour in the land this is Abraham he
[1:07:02] soured in the land of what promise who
[1:07:06] promised Abraham the land Jesus God who
[1:07:09] gave him the land god so if Abraham is
[1:07:12] in the land that God promised and give
[1:07:15] it to him Abraham should be
[1:07:18] satisfied that God told me I give you
[1:07:21] the promised land I'm in the promised
[1:07:23] land I sit in the promised land that's
[1:07:25] it
[1:07:26] but there was something about Abraham
[1:07:29] even though God gave him a natural
[1:07:32] land come on brother amen even though
[1:07:36] God gave him a natural land but Abraham
[1:07:40] understood that there is more than the
[1:07:42] natural
[1:07:45] land the Bible says that he sour in the
[1:07:50] land of
[1:07:51] promise as in a what strange country how
[1:07:55] can you go where God told you go
[1:07:57] somewhere I give you the land who says
[1:08:00] God who gave it to you God who fight for
[1:08:04] you God and you get
[1:08:07] there and instead of living
[1:08:12] comfortable like everything is okay I
[1:08:15] belong this is the ground that God gave
[1:08:17] me I can fight for it Abraham when he
[1:08:20] got there he's living like a stranger
[1:08:25] what makes Abraham Live Like a Stranger
[1:08:29] even though he's in the promised
[1:08:32] land even though you are in the place
[1:08:35] where God wants you to be you are in the
[1:08:38] country where God wants you to be but
[1:08:41] still you need to know where you coming
[1:08:45] from and the only way to know is by
[1:08:49] Faith by Revelation so Abraham was never
[1:08:53] satisfied in the Promised Land
[1:08:56] even though his Blessing ATT tied to the
[1:08:59] promised land but the promised land was
[1:09:01] not the end of
[1:09:04] Abraham America is not our
[1:09:11] end are we together are we together are
[1:09:15] we the Seed of Abraham and therefore we
[1:09:18] need to behave like Abraham Abraham they
[1:09:21] gave him a country but he was not
[1:09:23] satisfied he was not
[1:09:26] comfortable in the promised land how can
[1:09:29] you be in the promised land and you're
[1:09:31] not comfortable because there is another
[1:09:35] record there is another nationality that
[1:09:38] is calling for
[1:09:41] Abraham the promised land was only a
[1:09:44] type it was only a shadow of the true
[1:09:49] [Applause]
[1:09:51] nationality are we together are we
[1:09:54] together he says he live in the promised
[1:09:57] land as in a what strange country a
[1:10:00] strange country dwelling in what
[1:10:03] Tabernacles with Isaac and who Jacob the
[1:10:06] hair of him of the what the same promise
[1:10:08] the hair with him of the same promise
[1:10:10] for for means because the reason why he
[1:10:14] was living like that is
[1:10:18] because he
[1:10:20] looked amen for a what a city which has
[1:10:24] what Foundation whose Builder and maker
[1:10:28] is who God Abraham understood that for
[1:10:32] me to be comfortable I need a house that

[1:10:40] himself is the
[1:10:42] Builder God live in the house built by
[1:10:48] God you are Gods your future home is a
[1:10:53] house built by God not by human being

[1:11:31] when I get into the city I got in the
[1:11:34] city of
[1:11:36] [Applause]
[1:11:38] gods in the city of gods the lamb
[1:11:41] himself is a light that's the city that
[1:11:45] I'm comfortable in that City I don't
[1:11:48] behave as a
[1:11:50] Sur I behave like I'm

[1:37:03] to him father I have sin against the
[1:37:05] heaven and before you and I'm no more
[1:37:08] worthy to be called your son based on
[1:37:12] what he did he disqualified himself from
[1:37:17] being a son he say a son of a father
[1:37:21] like that cannot behave
[1:37:24] the way I

[2:23:25] for the vineyard of the Lord of host is
[2:23:27] what the house of
[2:23:30] Israel are we clear now we clear now we
[2:23:34] clear now the house of Israel is this
[2:23:37] Vineyard remember we dealing with the
[2:23:40] other
[2:23:41] son we clear now now let's go back to
[2:23:44] our Bible the Bible says and when the
[2:23:48] time 34 of the fruit dwai he sent his
[2:23:51] servant to the husbandman that they
[2:23:53] might receive the fruits of it and the
[2:23:55] husbandman took his servant and beat one
[2:23:59] and did what killed another and did what
[2:24:01] stoned another these are killers they
[2:24:05] they kill and stone again he sent
[2:24:08] another other servant more than the
[2:24:10] first and they did to them how meaning
[2:24:13] they kill and stone but last of all he
[2:24:18] sent to them who his
[2:24:22] son we need to see how many son does he
[2:24:26] have but here it's singular his son
[2:24:30] saying they will reverence my son but
[2:24:33] when the husband men saw the son they
[2:24:35] say among themel this is the air come
[2:24:38] let us do what kill him like they killed
[2:24:41] the other and let us seize on his
[2:24:43] inheritance and they caught him and cast
[2:24:46] him out of the vineyard and slew him
[2:24:48] when the Lord therefore of the vineyard
[2:24:50] come what will he do to these husband
[2:24:53] men they say to him he will miserably
[2:24:56] destroy those wicked men and will let
[2:24:59] out his Vineyard to other husband men
[2:25:02] which shall render him the
[2:25:05] fruits when in their season so when
[2:25:08] Israel will destroy the
[2:25:11] son the last messenger of Israel will be
[2:25:15] the son God who in San time spoke to Our
[2:25:21] Father by the in this last days SP To Us
[2:25:26] by the but when they will kill the son
[2:25:29] The Vineyard will be removed from
[2:25:32] Israel and send to other husband men
[2:25:36] that will give fruit in its season
[2:25:41] spiritual food in It season so the
[2:25:45] Gentile will have seasons

[2:26:47] people was where in Egypt they were what
[2:26:50] good Vine and they were God's what
[2:26:52] chosen but if a good
[2:26:56] Vine is not set in good
[2:26:59] ground he will not bring forth what good
[2:27:04] fruits
