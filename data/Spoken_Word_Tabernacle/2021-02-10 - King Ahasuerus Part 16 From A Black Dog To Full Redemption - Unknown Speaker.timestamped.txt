[9:50] oh i've sent my
[9:54] word and healed your disease
[10:00] i am lord
[10:04] your ear we sing it back to him and we
[10:07] say
[10:08] you are you are the god
[10:13] that he let me
[10:22] [Music]
[10:29] and heal my disease
[10:35] you are lord my healer
[10:41] oh you are the lord
[10:46] [Music]
[10:48] that saved my soul
[10:52] you are lord
[10:55] my savior
[11:00] you sent your word and forgave
[11:05] all my sins
[11:09] you are lord
[11:12] my savior one more time you
[11:16] are the god you are the god
[11:22] that healeth me
[11:26] you are
[11:30] [Music]
[11:39] my disease
[11:43] you are lord
[11:46] my healer
[11:49] now church when you look at those words
[11:52] you might think
[11:54] of a situation that you were in where
[11:56] god's healed you
[11:58] where you've been sick and you prayed
[11:59] and you said lord heal me and he's
[12:01] healed you and you may sing when you
[12:02] sing the song you may think back to that
[12:04] you are my healer but if you look at
[12:07] this song in the future too
[12:09] of anything that might come into your
[12:10] body any sickness that the doctor may
[12:12] say you have any disease
[12:14] whether it be cancer or diabetes or low
[12:16] blood sugar whatever it may be
[12:18] these words still remain the same these
[12:21] words still remain the same
[12:23] before after god is the same yesterday
[12:26] today and forever and if he told you
[12:28] that he is your healer he's your healer
[12:30] before you're sick
[12:32] so if we just tap into that if we just
[12:34] look into that we never have to live
[12:36] a life a sickness a life a disease we
[12:39] don't have to accept cancer
[12:40] we don't have to accept the lies of the
[12:42] enemy because we can look at these words
[12:44] we can sing it
[12:45] and say lord we know you're our healer
[12:47] it's already done
[12:49] the battle is over the victory is won
[12:52] amen one more time
[12:56] oh sing it in present tense in future
[12:59] tense you
[13:00] are the lord
[13:03] and that he let
[13:07] [Music]
[13:14] oh you sense your word
[13:20] heal my disease you

[30:59] one
[31:02] [Music]
[31:16] keep that
[31:19] [Music]

[33:36] message
[33:37] so we need to keep the message flying
[33:39] how
[33:40] flying high by living clean
[33:44] and undefiled so by living clean
[33:48] and undefiled you keep that message
[33:52] flying high because you can quote the
[33:54] prophet all you want
[33:56] if your life is not shunning the message

[34:03] that lives with you
[34:05] amen we thank god for everything for his
[34:08] grace his mercy and giving us another
[34:10] opportunity to be here tonight
[34:13] to fellowship around the revealed word
[34:15] of the hour
[34:16] we concluded the
[34:20] vote on sunday
[34:23] there were few people that say no
[34:28] we respect that and everybody have a
[34:30] freedom and a liberty
[34:32] to say to vote as the fair led
[34:35] by the holy spirit but the majority win
[34:39] except if for those people that says no
[34:43] if you have a strong legitimate reason
[34:49] that is based on the scripture strong
[34:52] one
[34:53] you need to contact me before next
[34:56] sunday
[34:58] if by next sunday nobody says anything
[35:01] it is sealed
[35:03] until next year when we redo the vote
[35:07] so if you have a reason or you see
[35:09] somebody drunk
[35:11] and you have a picture or something like
[35:13] that you need to bring it to me then
[35:16] regardless of what the majority say we
[35:18] need to look that over
[35:19] amen but if i don't hear anything and
[35:22] you just say no because you felt led
[35:25] by the holy ghost to say no so the
[35:28] majority
[35:29] wins everybody clear so by next sunday
[35:32] if i don't hear anything it is still
[35:35] till next year if the lord
[35:38] tarries everybody clear so far
[35:41] on sunday lords willing we will have
[35:43] brother blue
[35:45] from south carolina preaching for us
[35:48] amen
[35:49] so keep the service in prayer and
[35:52] continue to stay
[35:53] tight in prayer because we don't need to
[35:56] leave our hand going down we need to
[35:58] keep it up
[35:59] so that amalek will not win let's go
[36:03] to the sermon tonight let's go to our
[36:06] scriptures
[36:07] if you have your bible you need to have
[36:09] one in this church
[36:12] and you need your bible tonight we're
[36:14] still continuing on
[36:15] where we left off on sunday so you
[36:18] really
[36:18] really need your bible amen
[36:23] genesis chapter 6
[36:28] hallelujah
[36:33] some amen corners are not here
[36:36] because they're working and they might
[36:39] be streaming so when they stream online
[36:41] amen i won't hear them
[36:46] i need that fuel so if you hear
[36:50] holler amen
[36:53] okay okay in this church we're free to
[36:56] say amen
[37:01] genesis chapter 6 if you dare you can
[37:05] say amen
[37:06] we're still continuing on the same
[37:08] subject
[37:10] verse 1 and it came to pass
[37:13] when men began to multiply
[37:16] on the face of the earth
[37:19] and daughters were born to them
[37:23] amen that the sons of god
[37:27] not the sons of devils
[37:31] amen not the one that are drunk over
[37:34] there
[37:35] we are talking about the sons of god
[37:40] how many believes the son of god tonight
[37:43] and daughters of god tonight
[37:45] yes so the bible is talking about the
[37:47] sons of god amen
[37:51] the sons of god saw the daughters
[37:54] of men that they were fair
[37:58] so there is an attraction to beauty here
[38:03] toward the daughter of men when they say
[38:07] beauty fair it's beautiful you might be
[38:10] seated
[38:13] so something happened to the sons of god
[38:16] they begin to get attracted to
[38:19] the women amen
[38:22] and if you study this these women
[38:26] these daughters that were fair were
[38:28] daughters of cain
[38:32] amen so something happened to the sons
[38:35] of god
[38:37] that they became they they start
[38:40] getting some kind of feeling
[38:43] toward the women from
[38:46] canada or the k-9
[38:50] women verse two
[38:53] that the sons of god saw the daughters
[38:55] of men
[38:56] that they were fair and they took them
[39:00] wives brother branham said the correct
[39:03] translation there
[39:04] is they took women
[39:08] women
[39:13] we believe the message amen
[39:18] and they took them wives of
[39:21] all which they chose
[39:24] so they get on the internet they just
[39:26] look look look look at picture
[39:28] and peek
[39:31] amen praise the name of the lord
[39:35] verse 3 and the lord say
[39:38] the lord didn't say anything until this
[39:41] happened
[39:42] until the children of god begin to court
[39:47] or to date the people of the world
[39:51] when they did that then god reacted
[39:56] amen and the lord say
[39:59] my spirit the holy ghost
[40:03] shall not always strive
[40:06] in other words i can't put up with this
[40:10] don't expect the the spirit of god
[40:14] or the anointing of god to put up with
[40:18] you
[40:18] when you begin to look on the outside it
[40:21] won't happen
[40:23] he grieves the holy spirit
[40:26] amen we are preparing you to the sacred
[40:29] banquet
[40:31] my spirit shall not always strive
[40:35] or put up or contain with men
[40:39] for that he also is flesh
[40:42] carnal and to be carnally minded is
[40:45] death we already preached to you that
[40:48] yet his days
[40:50] shall be a hundred and twenty
[40:53] years because of this because of the
[40:57] interest of the sons of god
[41:00] toward the women of the world
[41:03] amen the spirit of the lord was grieved
[41:07] and god even put a limitation
[41:11] on the life of someone
[41:15] instead of going 600 years 900 years
[41:18] like adam
[41:19] god shorten the time amen
[41:23] in other words you're going to a
[41:24] premature grave
[41:30] amen because of daring the outside
[41:37] verse four they were giant in the earth
[41:40] in those days
[41:41] and also after that when the sons of god
[41:46] came into the daughters of men
[41:49] amen they started getting into the
[41:52] physical
[41:53] amen at the beginning they saw
[41:58] the beginning it was just a sight
[42:02] they saw he was in the mind
[42:05] he was all spiritual amen
[42:09] that's number one once the spiritual is
[42:13] consumed
[42:14] then the second thing that started they
[42:17] get into the physical
[42:20] amen that's why jesus said if a man
[42:24] looketh unto a woman and last
[42:27] after her so there was the last that
[42:30] happened here
[42:31] hallelujah
[42:35] there was the last that happened here
[42:40] in a spiritual you have already
[42:43] committed what
[42:45] adultery so what happened on a physical
[42:49] is nothing else but an expression a
[42:52] manifestation
[42:53] of what happened in the spiritual amen
[42:57] if you are born again in the spirit
[43:00] it will all the way before we get
[43:03] into that place once the lord jesus
[43:05] christ come
[43:06] what happened on the inside of you will
[43:08] be manifested outside
[43:10] that's the cry of david amen
[43:14] so when they begin to come into the
[43:16] daughters of men
[43:17] and they bore children to them amen
[43:21] the same became mighty men which were of
[43:24] old
[43:25] men of renown they begin to have stars
[43:28] american adults verse 5
[43:32] and god saw the wickedness of man
[43:35] so this is not a marriage
[43:39] because if it's marriage marriage is
[43:41] honorable by god
[43:43] but this is not marriage when god saw
[43:46] those sin
[43:47] taking care taking places where the
[43:49] children of god begin to have
[43:51] affair or begin to have sexual affairs
[43:55] with the children outside
[44:00] god call it wicked when god saw the
[44:04] wickedness
[44:05] of man was great in the earth
[44:09] and that every water it started from the
[44:13] mind
[44:14] right here every imagination right here
[44:18] everybody clear every imagination the
[44:21] birth of it
[44:23] every imagination of the what
[44:26] the thoughts of water that's why jesus
[44:30] said if you look at a woman
[44:32] and you last after her you have already
[44:34] committed adultery where
[44:37] you see the imagination in the
[44:40] amen every imagination of the thoughts
[44:43] of his heart
[44:44] was only evil water in other words
[44:48] all the time you always thinking about
[44:51] something that is bad
[44:53] continually all the time constantly
[44:56] you are under something that is wrong i
[44:59] wish

[46:20] which she brought to jacob went out
[46:23] to see who the daughters of
[46:26] the land she was living somewhere
[46:30] secluded that looks like they are
[46:33] in a certain camp where they don't
[46:35] fellowship with the outside
[46:38] but for some reason donna left the camp
[46:42] and went outside not to fellowship with
[46:46] the men
[46:47] but she was going to fellowship with the
[46:49] daughters
[46:51] of the land the daughters that are not
[46:53] in the family
[46:54] of jacob just like the sons of god
[46:58] begin to look at the daughter that are
[47:00] not
[47:01] part of the family of god anybody here
[47:05] she opened a door friendship with the
[47:07] world
[47:08] i believe i can have friends outside
[47:11] that are even better than some of the
[47:13] message believers
[47:18] oh my god this is better amen thank you
[47:23] and when she came the son of hemor
[47:26] dehydrated a gentile prince of the
[47:30] country saw her
[47:32] he took her and lay with her
[47:36] and did water do you know what that
[47:39] means
[47:40] if you look at another translation it
[47:42] means she was raped
[47:45] she was never raped when she stayed
[47:49] in her father's home amen
[47:53] when she exposed herself outside
[47:58] a boy saw her and from there she was
[48:02] completely raped
[48:04] defiled they didn't say she was married
[48:11] anybody clear verse four
[48:15] verse three and he's so clung
[48:18] to donna how can you love a woman after
[48:21] raping her
[48:23] the daughter of jacob and he loved the
[48:26] demsel and spoke kindly to the damsel
[48:29] and she came spoke to his father amor
[48:32] saying
[48:33] get me this themselves as a wife they
[48:36] should have started there first
[48:39] amen they should have started to speak
[48:42] to the parent
[48:43] first before you get into the physical
[48:47] they went into the physical and tried to
[48:49] correct after
[48:55] the black dog
[48:59] the black dog amen
[49:02] and jacob heard that he had
[49:05] married donna
[49:09] okay somebody is awake okay
[49:12] and jacob heard that he had defiled
[49:15] donna his daughter
[49:17] now his sons were with this cattle
[49:20] in the field and jacob held his peace
[49:23] until they were come and emma the father
[49:27] of chicken went out to jacob
[49:29] to commune with him now it's involving
[49:31] the parent
[49:32] it should start there first amen
[49:36] verse 7 and the sons of jacob came out
[49:39] of the field
[49:40] when they heard it they were so happy
[49:47] if it's a good relationship why are they
[49:49] grieved
[49:51] they were grieved and they were very
[49:55] angry because he
[49:58] sheikham had wrote
[50:02] folly in israel in lying
[50:06] with jacob's daughter which
[50:09] thing not to be done
[50:14] lying with jacob's daughter
[50:17] without the proper approach of marriage
[50:20] it's something that is not acceptable
[50:25] amen job to verse 31
[50:28] and they said should he deal with her
[50:31] sister
[50:32] as with a water not like with a wife
[50:36] a housewife like a harlot she
[50:40] left the camper and she was treated
[50:43] low like a prostitute
[50:47] when you leave the camp when you're
[50:49] trying to go outside
[50:52] this is the way they're going to treat
[50:53] you
[50:56] let's go to second timothy chapter 2
[51:06] amen
[51:08] second timothy chapter 2
[51:12] take verse 4 first if you dare you can
[51:15] say amen
[51:18] hallelujah no man that was
[51:23] if you are in war entangles himself
[51:28] with the affairs of this life
[51:31] amen if you know that you're in the
[51:34] stage of battle of war
[51:36] you need to be careful the way you
[51:38] handle your life
[51:41] amen that he may please him
[51:45] who has done what chosen by
[51:48] predestination
[51:49] who has chosen him to be a water
[51:52] so it's a predestination but you need to
[51:54] be careful because you're in a war zone
[51:57] job to verse 19 nevertheless the
[52:01] foundation of god
[52:02] stand what it is firm
[52:05] having this hill the lord knows them
[52:09] that are water
[52:11] and let everyone that names the name of
[52:14] christ depart from what
[52:17] you know better but you still doing it
[52:22] verse 20 but in a great house
[52:25] they are not only vessels of gold and of
[52:29] silver
[52:30] but also of what and of earth
[52:33] and some to honor and some to dishonor
[52:37] verse 21 if a man therefore
[52:41] purge himself from this
[52:44] he shall be a vessel to honor
[52:48] sanctify and meet for the master's
[52:51] use and prepare to every good
[52:55] work a sanctified vessel
[52:58] is ready to be used by the master
[53:01] verse 22 flee also what
[53:05] the last of your youth
[53:08] amen there is three categories i will
[53:11] see how the holy spirit leads
[53:14] when you are born you are completely
[53:17] turned off
[53:22] at your breath you are turned off
[53:25] completely you are almost like dead
[53:28] everybody clear that's why a child a
[53:31] little girl
[53:32] or a little boy have nothing to do with
[53:34] lust
[53:36] amen they are turned off
[53:39] when you reach puberty
[53:44] adolescence then you are turned on
[53:48] are you following me i'm going to preach
[53:50] this as clear as i can
[53:52] amen from adolescence
[53:56] if you miss the step you normally need
[53:59] to go
[54:00] straight to marriage anybody there
[54:05] if you miss the step you begin to live
[54:08] an unclean promiscuous life
[54:11] are you following me then in the
[54:13] marriage
[54:15] you're gonna go all the way to a certain
[54:18] age
[54:19] which for the sister it's called
[54:22] menopause
[54:25] you need coach for menopause me
[54:28] for the boys the man sometimes they call
[54:31] it like a late puberty
[54:34] amen and after that you are
[54:38] turned back off
[54:43] and you become dead like
[54:46] abraham and sarah their body was good as
[54:50] what
[54:51] dead that's why when god was giving the
[54:54] promise
[54:55] say i say how shall i have what pleasure
[54:58] with my husband she reached the edge
[55:00] where she's turned off
[55:06] the opening of the seven seals
[55:10] let's go to verse 22 flee also the
[55:13] youthful lust
[55:15] but follow righteousness faith
[55:19] charity in other words don't entertain
[55:21] the black dog
[55:23] what you need to focus on is everything
[55:26] that
[55:26] follows righteousness faith
[55:30] charity peace with them that call on the
[55:34] lord out of water
[55:36] a pure heart that is the association
[55:40] that you stay with if you come out of
[55:43] that association
[55:44] you put yourself in trouble anybody

[56:52] we committed all
[56:53] be the alpha and the omega may the devil
[56:55] and every pharisees any problem
[56:58] any circumstances be completely sealed
[57:00] out of this place
[57:02] and may only the holy spirit be sealed
[57:04] in heaven open lord
[57:06] pour in your shower tonight lord in the
[57:08] name of jesus christ
[57:10] amen god bless you last on sunday we
[57:14] were on part 15
[57:16] we stopped somewhere and we are picking
[57:18] up on part
[57:19] 16. when we get into this sport
[57:22] we express about the cry of david
[57:26] and we found out that the cry of david
[57:28] have a twofold mystery
[57:30] david was crying out of his soul
[57:34] for the redemption of the soul and david
[57:37] also was crying for the redemption of
[57:39] his body
[57:40] or the redemption of his flesh and to
[57:43] simplify
[57:44] the thing we went straight again instead
[57:46] of using body soul spirit we went with
[57:49] romans 7
[57:50] where we use the inner man and the other
[57:53] man everybody clear
[57:54] and when we use the inner man and the
[57:57] other man
[57:57] on sunday we gave you three scenarios
[58:01] the first scenario which is one is when
[58:04] we are born
[58:05] by birth when we are born david spoke in
[58:09] psalm 51
[58:10] if i'm not mistaken that we are burning
[58:13] sin
[58:14] shaping iniquity coming into the word
[58:17] speaking lies in other words from our
[58:19] inside
[58:20] i all the way to the uh to the outside
[58:23] we were completely
[58:24] dark and dominated by a nature of sin
[58:28] in other words on the east side you have
[58:30] a black dog
[58:32] and on the outside you also have a black
[58:34] dog
[58:35] and because those two nature are the
[58:38] same
[58:38] when a kingdom have a nature that are on
[58:41] the same
[58:42] christ taught us that that kingdom will
[58:44] never be defiled
[58:45] because there is no way that satan can
[58:48] cast out satan
[58:49] jesus said that if satan cast her satan
[58:52] it means that his own kingdom is divided
[58:55] so once you are as long as you still
[58:58] walking in sin walking in darkness
[59:01] shaping iniquity doing everything that
[59:03] you can
[59:04] here you are completely manifesting the
[59:07] kingdom of the devil
[59:08] everybody clear so far then we went to
[59:11] the second scenario
[59:13] where in the second scenario it is with
[59:16] the coming of the gospel
[59:18] and the holy spirit on the other man or
[59:21] the outside
[59:22] the black dog is still there dominating
[59:25] your body
[59:26] but the work of redemption approaches
[59:28] you
[59:29] from the inner man which is your soul
[59:32] amen
[59:33] so to move from the first scenario all
[59:36] the way to the second scenario
[59:38] it came it comes with the uh the
[59:41] the oncoming of the holy spirit in your
[59:44] life
[59:44] so when the holy ghost comes into your
[59:46] life he approaches your soul
[59:49] and take the nature of sin out of your
[59:52] soul
[59:53] so now you reach a scenario where the
[59:55] outside is still black with the black
[59:58] dog
[59:59] but the inside is now white because god
[1:00:02] came in your life by the baptism of the
[1:00:05] holy spirit
[1:00:06] because if you're a child of god and you
[1:00:09] were chosen before the foundation
[1:00:11] of the world on the inside of you there
[1:00:14] is a predestinated seed
[1:00:16] then brother branham said the
[1:00:17] predestinated seed is an absorbent of
[1:00:20] the holy spirit
[1:00:22] it is something that when the holy
[1:00:23] spirit comes he has the power to attract
[1:00:26] and to lock the holy spirit in your life
[1:00:30] that's why you are sealed until the day
[1:00:33] of redemption
[1:00:34] it is not an anointing that get in and
[1:00:37] come out
[1:00:37] but once you are still the work of the
[1:00:40] inner man is completely
[1:00:42] done and you are completely redeemed
[1:00:45] if you die right there you're going
[1:00:47] straight into the presence
[1:00:48] of the living god so when the holy
[1:00:50] spirit comes
[1:00:52] the predestinated seed will attract it
[1:00:54] and sell it in your life
[1:00:56] everybody clear let's take out to
[1:00:58] chapter 26
[1:01:00] as we're moving praise the name of the
[1:01:02] lord
[1:01:04] act chapter 26
[1:01:08] so when you leave from part one to two
[1:01:11] you are actually changing kingdom
[1:01:14] you are living the kingdom of darkness
[1:01:17] when it was black dog on the inside
[1:01:19] black dog on the outside
[1:01:21] and you go into a kingdom of light but
[1:01:24] that light is not on your body
[1:01:26] that light is within your soul anybody
[1:01:29] clear
[1:01:30] acts chapter 26 if you there you can say
[1:01:32] amen
[1:01:34] i will go slowly with this sermon until
[1:01:36] we get that devil
[1:01:38] out amen when i say young people if you
[1:01:42] are not in the same family don't drive
[1:01:44] together
[1:01:45] it doesn't mean that i don't trust the
[1:01:47] young people
[1:01:48] i trust the young people but i don't
[1:01:50] trust the black dog
[1:01:53] amen i trust you but i don't trust the
[1:01:56] black dog
[1:01:56] on your flesh
[1:02:00] amen acts 26 verse
[1:02:04] 15. if you there you can say amen
[1:02:08] this is apostle paul and i said who are
[1:02:11] you lord
[1:02:11] paul is talking about his experience and
[1:02:14] he say i am jesus
[1:02:16] whom you persecute but to rise and stand
[1:02:19] up on your feet
[1:02:21] for i have appeared to you for this
[1:02:23] purpose
[1:02:24] to make you a minister and a witness
[1:02:28] both of these things which you have seen
[1:02:30] and of those things in which i will
[1:02:33] appear to you
[1:02:34] continuity of the ministry verse 17
[1:02:37] delivering you from the people
[1:02:41] and from the gentile to whom and to whom
[1:02:45] now
[1:02:45] i send you verse 18 to do what
[1:02:49] to open their eyes everybody clear
[1:02:53] remember when the eyes of paul were open
[1:02:56] physically
[1:02:57] the bible says that the holy spirit
[1:02:59] entered into him
[1:03:00] and he was filled with the holy spirit
[1:03:03] he said to
[1:03:03] open their eyes and to turn them from
[1:03:07] water
[1:03:08] from darkness from one everybody
[1:03:11] where it's black dark black dog to turn
[1:03:14] them from darkness
[1:03:15] to what to light and from the power of
[1:03:19] satan to water
[1:03:21] so right here you are completely and
[1:03:23] totally under the power of satan
[1:03:26] but on the outside now you are changing
[1:03:29] kingdom
[1:03:30] but even though you are changing kingdom
[1:03:33] you are still
[1:03:34] in the world that's why jesus said you
[1:03:37] are
[1:03:38] in the world but you are no more
[1:03:41] of the world you are still living
[1:03:44] on the planet earth under the politics
[1:03:48] under the cosmos of this world but your
[1:03:51] inside
[1:03:52] is no longer of the world you are
[1:03:55] longing like
[1:03:56] abraham for a city whose builder and
[1:04:00] maker is god
[1:04:02] this world become uncomfortable for you
[1:04:05] because you don't fit in the reason why
[1:04:08] you don't feel it because the inside man
[1:04:10] is a regenerated man again
[1:04:14] everybody clear praise the name of the
[1:04:17] lord and from the power of satan
[1:04:20] to god that they may receive water
[1:04:24] forgiveness of sin and what
[1:04:27] inheritance among them which are water
[1:04:31] sanctified by what faith which is a gift
[1:04:35] of god

[1:06:58] of evil anybody clear
[1:07:02] who has delivered us from the power of
[1:07:05] darkness

[1:07:32] through the blood even the water
[1:07:35] forgiveness
[1:07:36] of sin ever clear when you are
[1:07:38] translated into what a kingdom for
[1:07:41] redemption
[1:07:43] anybody clear so far so once you move
[1:07:46] from stage one
[1:07:48] all the way to stage two then the white
[1:07:51] dog which is the holy spirit get into
[1:07:54] your soul
[1:07:55] as soon as the white dog get in your

[1:08:02] amalek start a fight with you
[1:08:04] anybody clear no problem so when
[1:08:07] this fight start like we spoke on sunday
[1:08:10] the white uh the black dog purpose is to
[1:08:14] bring you
[1:08:14] back again to where you're going so
[1:08:17] if you feel a pull of trying to pull you
[1:08:21] toward the world
[1:08:23] everybody clear it is not a curse
[1:08:29] anybody clear it is normal
[1:08:32] for the life of a christian amen
[1:08:35] the devil needed no effort to pull you
[1:08:39] in the world
[1:08:40] because you are part of the world the
[1:08:43] reason why he's trying to pull you
[1:08:46] it is a signal that you don't belong to
[1:08:49] his kingdom
[1:08:50] anymore that's why the temptation
[1:08:53] comes to take you back from where you
[1:08:55] came from
[1:08:57] amen what you think is a trouble
[1:09:01] what you think is a difficulty in your
[1:09:04] christian life
[1:09:05] you need to interpret that the right way
[1:09:10] amen that's why paul said it is not me
[1:09:13] that do it
[1:09:15] it is sin that dwell in me everybody
[1:09:18] here
[1:09:19] then in romans 8 he said there is
[1:09:21] therefore no word
[1:09:24] i cannot believe in condemning myself
[1:09:28] for those who are in water
[1:09:33] who walk not after that but after the
[1:09:37] water
[1:09:38] my desire lord is to please you
[1:09:41] i don't have a desire to do what is
[1:09:44] wrong
[1:09:45] so if i stumble i'm not lost
[1:09:48] it is the black dog trying to pull me
[1:09:51] back
[1:09:57] why is it hard for christian to leave
[1:10:01] a victorious life amen everybody clear
[1:10:05] so the black dog pulled this way but the
[1:10:08] white dog is pulling you forward
[1:10:11] because the first work here is a down
[1:10:15] payment you have not paid the house off
[1:10:18] yet
[1:10:19] amen it gives you access to the house
[1:10:22] but you got to make a full price
[1:10:24] everybody clear and the third stage
[1:10:27] over there the white dog not only stay
[1:10:31] here everybody clear
[1:10:34] but the white dog take over completely
[1:10:38] the entire body
[1:10:44] there was a stone there was an image i'm
[1:10:47] going to give you an example so you get
[1:10:48] it
[1:10:49] there was an image in daniel that image
[1:10:53] had four have four i can call it this
[1:10:58] way
[1:10:59] one two three four everybody remember
[1:11:01] that
[1:11:02] and that image represented the kingdom
[1:11:05] of the world
[1:11:07] everybody clear but there was a stone
[1:11:11] that came out of the mountain and the
[1:11:14] stone
[1:11:14] hit the kingdom here and destroyed the
[1:11:18] entire image but that stone never
[1:11:21] stopped there
[1:11:24] that storm begin to do what to grow
[1:11:28] to grow to grow until that stone
[1:11:31] filled the entire earth amen
[1:11:35] so when god comes in your life
[1:11:38] he's gonna destroy the kingdom of satan
[1:11:41] in your soul but the work of god don't
[1:11:44] stop there
[1:11:46] leader by leader as you die the holy
[1:11:49] spirit continues to push out
[1:11:52] to grow more to grammar to grammar
[1:11:55] to grammar until one day the
[1:11:59] gravitational
[1:12:00] forces of the earth
[1:12:04] do you want me to explain you because
[1:12:07] when moses was praying
[1:12:09] the hand of moses were up the reason why
[1:12:12] the hand of moses were going down
[1:12:15] it was because of the force of
[1:12:17] gravitation
[1:12:19] the force of gravitation is an opposite
[1:12:22] of
[1:12:23] accession amen so as the holy spirit
[1:12:27] grows
[1:12:28] more and more one of this day
[1:12:31] like enoch the forces of gravitation
[1:12:35] will lose

[1:31:49] jesus when he went to jordan
[1:31:51] jesus had to preach preach preach after

[1:32:32] about paul
[1:32:33] the will of god even your word
[1:32:36] so sanctification is the will of god
[1:32:40] [Music]
[1:32:41] holiness are you there
[1:32:45] why paul talking to christian
[1:32:48] he's insisting on sanctification
[1:32:51] because the black dog is still there
[1:32:55] you understand hallelujah
[1:32:59] even your sanctification that you should
[1:33:03] obtain from water
[1:33:06] you understand fornication
[1:33:09] in a clear blank explanation
[1:33:14] is sometimes the bible used that word
[1:33:16] back and forth
[1:33:18] but fornication by pure definition
[1:33:21] is having sexual relationship before
[1:33:24] marriage
[1:33:28] are you following me paulie said don't
[1:33:30] do that
[1:33:32] why because by going down out
[1:33:36] you are actually feeding the black dog
[1:33:40] are you following me you say i don't
[1:33:43] commit
[1:33:44] fornication but your pornography that
[1:33:47] you watching
[1:33:48] are you there he's already defiling your
[1:33:51] mind
[1:33:52] because jesus said if you look at a
[1:33:55] woman
[1:33:56] and you left after hell you are already
[1:33:59] committed adultery
[1:34:00] even though you are not there yet
[1:34:03] but you in the eyes of god you're in
[1:34:05] adultery
[1:34:11] i thought he preaches mysteries

[1:34:44] because the black dog is there
[1:34:49] are you following you are not fully
[1:34:51] redeemed yet
[1:34:56] learn that you know how to possess his
[1:35:00] vessel in water pure
[1:35:03] and water not in there
[1:35:08] lust of conceptions last of passion
[1:35:12] everybody clear even as the what
[1:35:16] the hidden which no not work in other
[1:35:19] words you cannot
[1:35:21] be a christian and behave like a
[1:35:24] pagan are you there

[1:35:32] under subjection you need to control
[1:35:36] the black dog

[1:35:50] do you see your song brother you see
[1:35:54] that
[1:35:55] god has not called us to work
[1:35:58] but what paul is reminding you that you
[1:36:02] have a fight in your body
[1:36:05] that fight that you have with the blood
[1:36:08] dog
[1:36:08] will try to pull you back to your old
[1:36:11] life
[1:36:12] he will try to pull you back to do the
[1:36:15] things that you left
[1:36:16] but remember you are dead to sin
[1:36:21] you need to control your body
[1:36:24] because god called you for
[1:36:27] sanctification
[1:36:29] and not uncleanness
[1:36:33] it is not a right to do things that is
[1:36:36] wrong because i'm sealed
[1:36:38] i'm gonna go in heaven no matter what
[1:36:41] we need to check that ceiling amen
[1:36:46] hebrew chapter 12 verse 14
[1:36:50] hallelujah
[1:36:54] hebrew 12 verse 14
[1:36:57] i got it here for you on the board so we

[1:37:09] without water no man shall see who
[1:37:14] without that sanctification you won't
[1:37:16] see god
[1:37:20] scripture that save the lord
[1:37:23] everybody clear praise the name of the
[1:37:26] lord
[1:37:27] on this stage where you are pulled this
[1:37:30] way
[1:37:31] and you are pulled the other way that's
[1:37:33] where the indian chief is
[1:37:36] he told brother branham they thought
[1:37:38] brother branham explained that sisa got
[1:37:40] born there is what
[1:37:41] a fight going on
[1:37:44] we told you that fight need to be
[1:37:46] handled by who
[1:37:48] joshua romans 6 22
[1:37:52] but now being made what
[1:37:55] free from sin you're on part two the sin
[1:37:58] is removed from your soul
[1:38:00] and become servant to god you have your
[1:38:03] fruit
[1:38:04] unto what your life now goes to
[1:38:07] sanctification
[1:38:09] and the end everlasting life for the
[1:38:12] wage of sin is what
[1:38:14] the salary of sin will kill you
[1:38:18] but the gift of god is eternal life
[1:38:21] through jesus christ hour
[1:38:24] first corinthians 15 the sting of death
[1:38:28] is
[1:38:29] and the strength of death is what
[1:38:32] the law but thank be to god which gave
[1:38:36] us the victory through who
[1:38:38] jesus the lord jesus christ romans 6
[1:38:42] knowing this that our old man the first
[1:38:45] nature
[1:38:46] remember him is what crucified
[1:38:50] with who that's why you don't go to the
[1:38:53] tribulation period
[1:38:55] are you there because the sixth seal
[1:38:58] hit jesus at the cross so when you
[1:39:02] identify with christ automatically your
[1:39:06] tribulation goes to the cross
[1:39:09] everybody cares that's why paul said i
[1:39:12] am crucified
[1:39:14] by identification
[1:39:17] just like because of adam you are going
[1:39:21] to trouble
[1:39:22] because of christ you also go to
[1:39:25] righteousness
[1:39:26] you don't have to be there in the garden
[1:39:28] of eden
[1:39:29] you are just undergoing what adam did
[1:39:33] so the same way if what adam did
[1:39:37] without you being physically present
[1:39:40] applied to you
[1:39:41] what christ did without you being
[1:39:44] physically present
[1:39:45] also applied to you
[1:39:49] [Music]
[1:39:51] it is a scripture if you need that
[1:39:52] scripture you give it you ask me
[1:39:55] the old man is crucified with who
[1:39:59] that the body of water might be
[1:40:02] destroyed the destroyer
[1:40:04] that henceforth we should not serve what
[1:40:08] in other words since you are redeemed
[1:40:11] you cannot
[1:40:12] be again a servant of sin
[1:40:15] you cannot be again living a sinful life
[1:40:21] hallelujah
[1:40:23] who is this melchizedek praise god
[1:40:27] but look when this body receives the
[1:40:31] water
[1:40:32] the spirit of god is somebody sleeping
[1:40:36] the spirit of god the immortal life
[1:40:38] inside of you
[1:40:40] he does what he throw this body
[1:40:43] into what because the white dog begin to
[1:40:48] control
[1:40:50] fight with the black dog you get it
[1:40:55] hallelujah he that is what
[1:40:59] on part two follow me he that is born of
[1:41:03] god do not work
[1:41:05] because inside of you there is no more
[1:41:08] sin
[1:41:09] you trap you trample into it
[1:41:13] but the desire of sin is no longer in
[1:41:16] you
[1:41:18] you don't sit down and say i'm gonna do
[1:41:21] something wrong
[1:41:22] no it is the black dog pushing you
[1:41:26] sometime
[1:41:27] and you find yourself angry and you say
[1:41:30] something that you were not supposed to
[1:41:32] say but down on this side you didn't
[1:41:35] want to say it
[1:41:37] because you are born of god you don't
[1:41:40] commit sin
[1:41:45] it is not your nature
[1:41:53] therefore he cannot sin romans 8 1.
[1:41:57] you see now therefore there is work
[1:42:01] you've been killing yourself
[1:42:05] you've been killing yourself it is time
[1:42:08] to change
[1:42:09] and just begin to give god more room
[1:42:13] in your life and he began to take care
[1:42:15] of your child
[1:42:16] he began to take care of your husband he
[1:42:19] began to take care of your business
[1:42:20] he began to take care of your hand he
[1:42:23] began to take care of your parents
[1:42:25] just give him more room
[1:42:30] there is therefore now no condemnation
[1:42:33] to them that are in christ jesus they
[1:42:35] walk not after the walking
[1:42:38] they're not servant to sin but after the
[1:42:40] water
[1:42:41] there you are see that throws your body
[1:42:44] what

[1:56:14] wake up
[1:56:16] inordinate what
[1:56:19] inordinate means affection that are not
[1:56:23] in order the order the proper order of
[1:56:28] god is for a man
[1:56:32] and a woman to meet together
[1:56:35] that is the proper order of god
[1:56:38] you want to see that on the scripture do
[1:56:42] you want to see that on the scripture
[1:56:44] yes or no you want to see it
[1:56:47] keep your finger right here let's go to
[1:56:50] genesis
[1:56:54] go to genesis chapter 19
[1:57:09] are you there we're going to go back to
[1:57:12] colossians keep genesis chapter 19. are
[1:57:14] you there
[1:57:16] genesis chapter 19 verse 30.
[1:57:20] you there they destroy sodom
[1:57:24] and gomorrah lord came out verse 30 and
[1:57:28] lot went out of zora
[1:57:30] and dwell in the mountain and his two
[1:57:33] daughters with him
[1:57:34] for he feel to dwell in zore and he
[1:57:37] dwell
[1:57:38] in a cave he and his two water
[1:57:41] daughters verse 31 and the firstborn
[1:57:44] said to the younger
[1:57:46] our father is old and there is not
[1:57:49] a what those women came from a city of
[1:57:53] homosexual
[1:57:55] but when they grew up they were not
[1:57:58] longing for women they were longing for
[1:58:00] a man
[1:58:03] you follow me continue
[1:58:07] our father is old and there is not a
[1:58:10] word
[1:58:11] a man in the earth to come into
[1:58:15] after the manner of what all the what so
[1:58:20] universally speaking the normal
[1:58:23] way of meeting is a man with a woman
[1:58:27] by the bible this
[1:58:30] is the order of god because when god
[1:58:33] created adam
[1:58:35] he created him male and female
[1:58:38] which is the image of god because
[1:58:41] god is male and female
[1:58:46] are you there the affection should be
[1:58:49] between
[1:58:50] male and female let's go back to
[1:58:52] collusion
[1:58:58] the opening of the seven seal
[1:59:01] the bible became a new book let's go to
[1:59:05] verse
[1:59:06] five inordinate what
[1:59:10] in other words unnatural affection even
[1:59:13] in the beast
[1:59:14] male female in the ark of noah
[1:59:17] male female bring the animal male female
[1:59:21] male female always correct order when
[1:59:24] it's inordinate
[1:59:26] it's when men begin to met with men
[1:59:29] or women with women paul is saying
[1:59:32] get that out of the church
[1:59:39] inordinate affection if or what
[1:59:43] concupisces passions and covetousness
[1:59:46] which is what
[1:59:48] idolatry let's drop down for
[1:59:52] which things seek because of these
[1:59:55] things
[1:59:56] the what came unto the children of water
[2:00:03] the graph of god will come on you
[2:00:06] because of fornication the wrath of god
[2:00:10] will come on you
[2:00:11] for having sexual relationship before
[2:00:14] marriage
[2:00:15] the wife of god will come from you for
[2:00:17] uncleanness
[2:00:19] for inordinate affection for all these
[2:00:22] things
[2:00:22] that's why the wrath of god came in
[2:00:25] genesis 6
[2:00:27] the wrath of god came upon the sons of
[2:00:30] god
[2:00:31] because the sons of god begin to look at
[2:00:34] the
[2:00:35] worldly women god say i'm not going to
[2:00:38] put up with that
[2:00:39] that is what paul is saying in colossae
[2:00:43] let me zero in to the report in this
[2:00:46] and we will catch up again brother
[2:00:50] branham
[2:00:52] he formulated a plane wherein god will
[2:00:55] be forced to deal with israel in death
[2:00:57] this is available just as satan knew
[2:01:01] that he could begin leave cause her to
[2:01:04] do what
[2:01:05] to fall in water the black dog
[2:01:09] you follow because here i told you there
[2:01:13] are
[2:01:14] you you come from birth from puberty
[2:01:18] there is a trouble here in puberty that
[2:01:20] comes here
[2:01:21] because you are turned on and the black
[2:01:23] dog because
[2:01:24] it's passion which is an avenue of your
[2:01:26] spirit the black dog claims that
[2:01:29] and begin to trouble you that's when you
[2:01:32] are curious
[2:01:33] young people that's why you want to read
[2:01:35] stuff you want to get on the internet
[2:01:38] it is the black dog troubling you that's
[2:01:40] why you sleep
[2:01:41] you begin to see unclean stuff in your
[2:01:48] dreams
[2:01:51] are you there puberty we're trying to
[2:01:54] guard you so that you can get in
[2:01:56] marriage
[2:01:58] when you begin to god displace menopause
[2:02:01] come
[2:02:01] it's another trouble
[2:02:06] let me leave that let's go here
[2:02:09] god has heard to fall in fleshly sin
[2:02:13] that's causing god to pass his
[2:02:15] pronounced sentence of death against him
[2:02:18] in other words make them sin so that god
[2:02:21] can whip them
[2:02:23] that's the case here so bellam knew that
[2:02:26] if he could get
[2:02:28] israel to sin god would have to deal
[2:02:31] with
[2:02:32] them in water you see what the devil
[2:02:35] does
[2:02:38] so he planned a way to get them
[2:02:41] to come over and join in what
[2:02:45] sends out the invitation
[2:02:50] dinah begin to leave the camper
[2:02:53] and begin to talk to other sister not
[2:02:56] sister
[2:02:56] to other girls on facebook facebook
[2:03:00] make friend make friends make friends
[2:03:02] make friends make friends
[2:03:04] make friends make friends you don't
[2:03:07] see that you going out of the camp
[2:03:10] send out invitation to come to the feast
[2:03:13] of bapeo
[2:03:14] come over and worship with us now israel
[2:03:17] no doubt has seen the feast of the
[2:03:19] egyptian worldly thing
[2:03:20] you were there before remember israel
[2:03:23] came out of egypt
[2:03:24] but the black dog was still there and
[2:03:27] the black dog was trying to pull them
[2:03:29] back to egypt
[2:03:31] amen now brother pronoun is saying that
[2:03:34] a religious
[2:03:35] people came and brought a feast
[2:03:39] but that feast looks like the feast that
[2:03:42] you were in the world
[2:03:48] they bring you a music and people are
[2:03:50] dancing
[2:03:51] and you look at the clip of the
[2:03:53] christian music
[2:03:56] you cannot even dance in front of your
[2:03:58] father
[2:04:01] women moving their hips
[2:04:06] and guess what you dancing and your
[2:04:08] father record you
[2:04:10] and put it on whatsapp that's why
[2:04:13] brother branham said it is
[2:04:14] parent delinquency
[2:04:21] now israel no doubt has seen the feast
[2:04:24] of the egyptian
[2:04:29] okay i'm gonna drop it
[2:04:33] if you in this church and they want to
[2:04:36] take you for a flower girl
[2:04:38] or a flower boy you watch
[2:04:42] what you're gonna do okay if they send
[2:04:45] me a movie
[2:04:46] and you dare on a party playing
[2:04:50] all kind of music because they took you
[2:04:53] as a flower girl
[2:04:54] or a flower girl or a what groom or
[2:04:57] whatever you call them
[2:04:59] i will have to deal with you i'm just
[2:05:02] warning you
[2:05:09] so the egyptian there did not feel it
[2:05:12] was too strong
[2:05:14] to go and just look on and perhaps eat
[2:05:17] with the people
[2:05:18] what is wrong with fellowship anyway we
[2:05:21] are supposed to love them brother
[2:05:22] stephen aren't we
[2:05:23] and how can we win them israel
[2:05:27] thought he's going to win the more about
[2:05:30] he didn't know that
[2:05:31] the more about put a trap to force god
[2:05:34] to whip
[2:05:35] them being friendly never hurt anyone
[2:05:40] donna got raped by being friendly
[2:05:45] and so they thought but one does what
[2:05:50] sexy more british women begin to do what
[2:05:54] and undress what they were whirling
[2:05:56] around
[2:05:57] moving their hips doing their hawk and
[2:06:00] roll and twist
[2:06:01] the water they begin to do things that
[2:06:05] feed the black dog in israel
[2:06:11] you see now the black dog the last
[2:06:14] rose up in the israelite and they were
[2:06:17] drawn
[2:06:18] into what by just one sin
[2:06:22] israel forget about the israeli women
[2:06:25] they went for the more british woman and
[2:06:28] what did god
[2:06:29] do and god in wrath through what
[2:06:33] 42 000 of them never forgive them
[2:06:38] i'm going to stop here bellamy
[2:06:43] had come down and taught the people his
[2:06:45] doctrine
[2:06:46] and they say now look we are all
[2:06:49] believers
[2:06:50] we are all christian we are not the same
[2:06:53] brother branham said there is a
[2:06:54] difference between the bride
[2:06:56] and the church
[2:07:00] he's just a christian he prayed the
[2:07:02] baptist he prayed over there
[2:07:05] if in the message we got in trouble how
[2:07:07] much more over there
[2:07:11] now look we are all believers we are
[2:07:13] lost children
[2:07:15] daughters children moab up there and say
[2:07:18] we are
[2:07:18] all the what we are not the same
[2:07:22] and he mixed them up cause what
[2:07:26] intermarriage marriage with the people
[2:07:29] that are not of your faith that don't
[2:07:32] believe like you
[2:07:35] the day they get in marriage and you
[2:07:38] begin to have
[2:07:38] children if that person shows his color
[2:07:42] you won't do
[2:07:42] anything they will put you on the
[2:07:45] custody
[2:07:46] and you're going to pay child support
[2:07:52] oh god okay
[2:07:55] okay he calls them pretty women
[2:07:59] praying more about women the sons of god
[2:08:03] fell for water
[2:08:06] all doored up and come down here and
[2:08:09] told the son of god that they were
[2:08:11] they were all the same after all god is
[2:08:14] god of all races
[2:08:15] and everything is all right he married
[2:08:18] them together
[2:08:19] and god and god drawed the separation
[2:08:22] line
[2:08:23] and made them leave their home and
[2:08:25] everything
[2:08:26] what was it see that thing just exactly
[2:08:30] what took place
[2:08:31] back there before the genesis 6.
[2:08:35] when the sons of god saw the daughters
[2:08:38] of men
[2:08:39] they were fair to look upon and they did
[2:08:42] what
[2:08:43] lasted for them and took them on to what
[2:08:48] internet did you notice
[2:08:52] he never said nothing about marriage
[2:08:54] because god said he was wickedness
[2:08:57] the sons of god came unto the daughters
[2:09:00] of men
[2:09:00] nothing about marriage if you take in
[2:09:03] the original greek there
[2:09:05] the word meaning says i've got it wrote
[2:09:07] down here somewhere
[2:09:09] a wife taken them wives in third verse
[2:09:12] taking them wife
[2:09:13] in the greek i looked it up this
[2:09:16] afternoon
[2:09:16] he didn't say take to them wife he said
[2:09:19] took to them what
[2:09:22] not wives take unto them what
[2:09:26] not wife they took them just as they
[2:09:29] were
[2:09:30] free what boyfriend girlfriend
[2:09:34] like we have today in other words
[2:09:37] they were lovers in that day
[2:09:41] just as they are now they
[2:09:44] went in any way they want to and they
[2:09:47] took
[2:09:47] any woman that they could who was doing
[2:09:51] that
[2:09:51] the young people in the church
[2:09:54] women of that day in the days of noah
[2:09:58] must have been the talk of the day the
[2:10:01] sons of god
[2:10:02] set sets on the correct lineage saw the
[2:10:05] daughter of who
[2:10:07] that they were what why they were
[2:10:11] wicked and they were daughters of cain
[2:10:14] when the sons of god saw the daughters
[2:10:16] of men
[2:10:17] they were fair they took unto them what
[2:10:21] then the sons of god fell from the what
[2:10:26] you lost your position and became what
[2:10:30] women chasers the sons of god fell
[2:10:34] because of what beautiful what
[2:10:37] form and what that's what they put to
[2:10:40] you that's why the women wear
[2:10:43] tight dresses to reveal the coca-cola
[2:10:47] border shape
[2:10:52] are you there of the daughters of men
[2:10:55] are you there

[2:11:09] we're going to close
[2:11:10] you i am tempted of what
[2:11:14] for god cannot be tempted with what
[2:11:18] that's why jesus said to satan
[2:11:21] you shall not tempt the lord your god
[2:11:26] are you there because god cannot be
[2:11:29] tempted with evil
[2:11:31] need attempted he any man he just put
[2:11:34] you to test
[2:11:35] but god don't tempt you to do something
[2:11:39] about every man is what

[2:11:45] it is your own weakness that is
[2:11:48] troubling you

[2:12:17] then when lust is what we are still in
[2:12:21] the mind
[2:12:22] brother when lust is conceived

[2:12:29] to sin and when sin is what
[2:12:32] when you consume youth you consume it in

[2:15:04] woman two hours
[2:15:05] on a telephone how can you be married
[2:15:10] and you talk to a man two hours on a
[2:15:12] telephone
[2:15:14] young people you are not coding
[2:15:18] why are you talking two hours with a man
[2:15:20] on the telephone
[2:15:21] no he's just the brother we just we just
[2:15:24] talk
[2:15:25] amen if you are coding you're trying to
[2:15:29] know one another what are you talking
[2:15:30] about
[2:15:32] are you talking about sex
[2:15:36] you are feeding the wrong dog
[2:15:39] there is a time where if you decide that
[2:15:41] you're going to get married
[2:15:44] the permissive will of god will open the
[2:15:47] door and i will explain you that
[2:15:49] in first corinthians 7 i need to teach
[2:15:51] that
[2:15:52] the progressive will of god will open it
[2:15:57] let's pray heavenly father lord we thank
[2:16:01] you again for your grace
[2:16:03] your love and your mercy and for
[2:16:05] everything you're doing
[2:16:06] father we started this banquet
[2:16:10] i myself didn't know what was hidden in
[2:16:14] but lord you are pulling the church
[2:16:17] into a state of complete redemption
[2:16:21] because the time is a hand we cater too
[2:16:24] much with heaven
[2:16:26] we play too much with him we give him
[2:16:29] too much space in our life until when we
[2:16:33] begin to move in this channel he is
[2:16:35] completely uncomfortable
[2:16:38] father it is just an expression of mercy
[2:16:42] because you're trying to deliver your
[2:16:44] people
[2:16:46] this is not to kill someone it is a
[2:16:49] mercy
[2:16:50] disguise in a sermon strong as this
[2:16:53] just to help us realize the state that
[2:16:56] we are in
[2:16:57] to examine ourselves whether we are in
[2:16:59] the faith
[2:17:00] to examine our life to examine where we
[2:17:03] lay down the bars
[2:17:05] where we open the doors where we are
[2:17:08] what have we done are we really grounded
[2:17:11] in the faithful
[2:17:12] or are we where we're just presuming
[2:17:16] do we really have that birth where the
[2:17:19] inner man
[2:17:20] is completely changed and translated to
[2:17:23] a new kingdom
[2:17:24] or are we still under the desire of sin
[2:17:28] because your word stated that the
[2:17:30] worshipper was purged
[2:17:32] have no more desire or conscience for
[2:17:35] sin
[2:17:36] what is the desire in our life what is
[2:17:39] the desire of our heart
[2:17:41] where is our motives and our objective
[2:17:44] father if there is somebody here that is
[2:17:47] struggling
[2:17:48] that have not met you that have been in
[2:17:50] the message
[2:17:51] under the umbrella of religion under the
[2:17:54] umbrella of being born in a message
[2:17:56] under the umbrella of having friend in
[2:17:58] the message
[2:17:59] may lord father they put down their
[2:18:01] religion down
[2:18:03] may they realize that they need them
[2:18:06] living god
[2:18:07] because that soul has been thirsted for
[2:18:10] a living god
[2:18:11] a god that can slay the old nature
[2:18:13] because you say the soul that sinner
[2:18:16] that soul will die we want the death of
[2:18:20] that also
[2:18:21] that all men must be crucified with
[2:18:24] christ
[2:18:25] father this is not the hour to play
[2:18:28] where time is already closing
[2:18:30] lord you are long suffering opening the
[2:18:33] door
[2:18:34] to tell your people that it's time to
[2:18:36] move from the first
[2:18:38] banquet onto the second banquet where
[2:18:41] that airmen
[2:18:42] will be killed but how can you get in
[2:18:44] the second banquet
[2:18:46] if you're not even in the first banquet
[2:18:48] how can you expect the rapture
[2:18:50] if you don't even have the redemption of
[2:18:52] the inner man
[2:18:55] and you that are already have their
[2:18:57] redemption
[2:18:59] but fall back because of your job
[2:19:02] because of entertainment because of
[2:19:04] politics
[2:19:06] because of this whatsapp crazy stuff
[2:19:09] that is going on with social media until
[2:19:12] we don't deserve what is good for our
[2:19:14] children
[2:19:15] what is good for our husband what is
[2:19:17] good for our wife
[2:19:18] but we open any kind of doors continuing
[2:19:22] to feed the black dog
[2:19:23] and we wonder why are we struggling why
[2:19:26] are we in the situation we are
[2:19:28] father may you be merciful to bring this
[2:19:30] church under desperation
[2:19:32] to bring your people to realize if they
[2:19:34] need to consecrate they need to
[2:19:36] consecrate more
[2:19:37] if they need to fast to seek you they
[2:19:39] need to do it if they need to correct
[2:19:41] their life they need to go repent
[2:19:43] correct their life stop our foolishness
[2:19:46] close doors account
[2:19:49] because you say that if your eye is a
[2:19:51] trouble to you
[2:19:52] it is better to go with one eye into
[2:19:55] heaven
[2:19:55] than have both eyes and find yourself in
[2:19:57] hell father i preach and i deliver the
[2:20:00] message
[2:20:01] as you gave it to me lord i'm committing
[2:20:03] this church unto the hand
[2:20:05] may the grace of god digress that give
[2:20:08] faith because it's a gift be given and
[2:20:10] granted to these young people
[2:20:12] be granted to your children so that
[2:20:15] father they can be born again
[2:20:17] and don't have to fight anybody but lord
[2:20:20] you take over from there
[2:20:21] and begin to grow in their life father
[2:20:23] be merciful to them
[2:20:25] as i'm pleading i'm asking as a shepherd
[2:20:28] lord
[2:20:29] father for those that you gave me
[2:20:31] responsibility
[2:20:32] that you be merciful father may you open
[2:20:35] it all
[2:20:36] where they can get that faith because
[2:20:38] it's not something that we manufacture
[2:20:40] it's a gift of god may you give them
[2:20:43] that faith
[2:20:44] that give us the victory that faith that
[2:20:46] will overcome
[2:20:48] that faith that will bring our bodies
[2:20:50] subject that faith that will control
[2:20:52] and stop the black dog father we commit
[2:20:55] the oncoming service onto the hand with
[2:20:57] brother blue
[2:20:58] lord take everything under control
[2:21:01] we committed and lord father asking that
[2:21:04] you give travel mercy to your children
[2:21:06] continue to consecrate them if i want to
[2:21:09] offer a little bit
[2:21:10] father you know it's not that we want to
[2:21:12] go over
[2:21:13] but the hour is late that we have to lay
[2:21:15] this thing
[2:21:16] because you say that you shall know the
[2:21:18] truth and the truth will set you free
[2:21:21] father we committed and asked in the
[2:21:23] name of jesus christ
[2:21:25] in the name of jesus christ in the name
[2:21:28] of jesus christ
[2:21:30] amen whatever you can take over god
[2:21:33] bless you church
[2:21:34] we fall off
[2:21:50] i enjoyed that this evening
[2:21:54] just make make a quick comment here um a
[2:21:57] lot of times parents that
[2:22:00] that come out of the world and come into
[2:22:01] the message and then they
[2:22:03] raise their kids in the message
[2:22:05] sometimes they don't have an
[2:22:06] understanding of the struggles that that
[2:22:07] kid
[2:22:08] is struggling with because you know
[2:22:11] you're raising them up in the right way
[2:22:13] but that that young person that you have
[2:22:16] i'm not a parent yet so
[2:22:18] hear me out but i was a young person
[2:22:21] that my parents
[2:22:22] came out of the world into the message
[2:22:23] and they raised me in the message
[2:22:25] and they just couldn't see the struggles
[2:22:27] they think it's an easy road
[2:22:29] sometimes it's not an easy road it's
[2:22:30] never an easy road so it's hard for the
[2:22:32] parents to understand so young people
[2:22:35] i'll encourage you you can't you can't
[2:22:37] think you're safe or secure just because
[2:22:39] your parents raised you in the message
[2:22:41] you got to find god
[2:22:42] for yourself and i i have a lengthy
[2:22:45] testimony i won't give it this evening
[2:22:47] but maybe if god permits some time i
[2:22:48] will
[2:22:49] to the young people about my journey how
[2:22:52] god
[2:22:52] made me find myself because i was living
[2:22:55] under my parents experience for a while
[2:22:57] and then satan took my dad out my mom
[2:23:01] was there and i was living under my
[2:23:02] mom's experience but
[2:23:03] god had to get me to a place where i
[2:23:05] found him for myself
[2:23:06] you have to have a personal relationship
[2:23:09] a personal walk with the lord for
[2:23:11] yourself
[2:23:11] this is directly directly to the young
[2:23:14] people
[2:23:15] but just make sure you have that
[2:23:17] personal relationship with god
[2:23:18] or else these things that creep in from
[2:23:20] the world they're gonna they're gonna
[2:23:23] make you stumble they're gonna make you
[2:23:24] fall they're gonna you're gonna look at
[2:23:25] the world and wonder what it's like
[2:23:27] because you never got to experience it
[2:23:29] but let me tell you you're not missing
[2:23:30] nothing
[2:23:31] you are not missing nothing it's uh
[2:23:34] there's
[2:23:34] nothing out there that's worth your time
[2:23:36] or anything
[2:23:38] and your parents can tell you that but
[2:23:39] yet they still don't know what it's like
[2:23:41] to be born and raised in the message
[2:23:43] and have that struggle of finding
[2:23:44] yourself so i just encourage you stay
[2:23:46] away from those things
[2:23:47] stay in the word as brother shane goes
[2:23:49] preaching all all this evening
[2:23:52] feed the correct dog feed that white dog

[2:24:00] away whatever it may be and pull out
[2:24:02] your bible
