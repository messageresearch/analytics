[0:16] I have plenty of time.
[0:18] &gt;&gt; I don't know what kind of gear you guys
[0:20] are changing now. It looks like we're
[0:22] moving faster. I don't know. Amen.
[0:25] LISTEN TO BROTHER BRHAM. HE SAYS YOU
[0:28] KNOW FAITH COMETH BY WHAT?
[0:30] &gt;&gt; HEARING.
[0:32] &gt;&gt; What does hearing means?
[0:35] &gt;&gt; Talking about it.
[0:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:39] &gt;&gt; Faith cometh by what?
[0:41] &gt;&gt; Hearing
[0:41] &gt;&gt; meaning what?
[0:42] &gt;&gt; TALKING ABOUT IT.
[0:44] &gt;&gt; SO IF YOU DON'T TALK ABOUT HIM, HOW IS
[0:47] PHARAOH GOING TO HAVE FAITH?
[0:51] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE WHEN THE BATTLER SPOKE, PHARAOH
[0:53] SAID, "BRING HIM QUICKLY." IN OTHER
[0:55] WORDS, PHARAOH HAD FAITH
[0:57] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE SOMEBODY SPOKE.
[1:05] &gt;&gt; HOW IS YOUR BOSS GOING TO HAVE FAITH?
[1:10] &gt;&gt; HOW IS YOUR NEIGHBOR GOING TO HAVE FAITH
[1:13] &gt;&gt; IF YOU DON'T TALK ABOUT YOUR BIG GOD?
[1:17] THE GOD THAT PROTECTED YOU.
[1:19] &gt;&gt; THE GOD THAT WOKE YOU UP THIS MORNING.
[1:22] &gt;&gt; THE GOD THAT GIVE YOU A CAR WHEN PEOPLE
[1:24] DON'T HAVE CAR.
[1:26] &gt;&gt; THE GOD THAT GIVE YOU A HOUSE WHEN
[1:28] PEOPLE ARE REJECTED, DISQUALIFIED.
[1:31] &gt;&gt; WHY DON'T YOU TALK ABOUT THAT ONE?
[1:39] &gt;&gt; HE SAYS TALKING ABOUT IT. WE DON'T DO
[1:42] WHAT
[1:43] &gt;&gt; ENOUGH TALKING
[1:44] &gt;&gt; ABOUT WHAT? GOOD THINGS OF GOD.
[1:51] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:52] &gt;&gt; I'm like I'm my friend. Go ahead and
[1:54] read it while I'm wiping myself. Please
[1:56] &gt;&gt; reread it.
[1:58] &gt;&gt; Go ahead, my friend. Yes, you read it.
[2:00] &gt;&gt; Reread it.
[2:01] &gt;&gt; Uh, go reread it again, please. Thank
[2:03] you. You go ahead.
[2:04] &gt;&gt; You know, faith cometh by hearing.
[2:06] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[2:06] &gt;&gt; Talking about it.
[2:08] &gt;&gt; We don't do enough talking about the
[2:10] good things OF GOD. DID YOU SEE BROTHER
[2:12] BRANDHAM say about the bad things that
[2:14] happened to you?
[2:15] &gt;&gt; You do you you you need to talk too
[2:18] much.
[2:19] &gt;&gt; This is what it means. You talk too much
[2:21] about the good things of God.
[2:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25] &gt;&gt; AMEN. SO IF YOU TALK 2 HOURS, YOU NEED
[2:28] TO MONITOR YOUR CONVERSATION
[2:31] &gt;&gt; AND SEE HOW MANY GOOD THINGS OF GOD THAT
[2:34] YOU TALK WITH YOUR BROTHER,
[2:35] &gt;&gt; WITH YOUR sister over the PHONE THAT CAN
[2:38] SEASON THEIR FAITH
[2:40] &gt;&gt; AND SAY, "YOU KNOW WHAT, SISTER? WOULD
[2:42] YOU JOIN ME IN PRAYER?"
[2:44] &gt;&gt; WOULD YOU PRAY FOR ME ALSO SO GOD CAN DO
[2:47] SOMETHING IN MY LIFE?
[2:51] &gt;&gt; OR I WONDER IF GOD EVER DONE SOMETHING
[2:54] FOR YOU.
[2:57] THAT'S WHY YOU DON'T TALK TOO MUCH
[2:59] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE YOU HAVE NO INPUT
[3:01] &gt;&gt; AND THERE IS NO OUTPUT.
[3:03] &gt;&gt; SO CHRIST IS NOT THERE YET.
[3:06] &gt;&gt; SO WHAT IS THERE?
[3:10] &gt;&gt; WHAT IS IN THERE?
[3:12] &gt;&gt; WHAT IS IN THERE IS WHAT COME OUT.
[3:16] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[3:17] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN.
[3:20] &gt;&gt; IF IT'S POLITICS, IT'S POLITICS THAT
[3:22] WILL COME OUT.
[3:30] SIT WITH A BROTHER, YOU KNOW WHERE HE
[3:32] IS.
[3:33] &gt;&gt; TALK WITH A SISTER, YOU KNOW WHAT THEY
[3:35] ARE WATCHING.
[3:42] &gt;&gt; You want me finish?

[3:53] WHAT

[4:03] &gt;&gt; Let me straighten up myself a LITTLE
[4:05] BIT.

[4:17] &gt;&gt; NCAA,

[4:26] &gt;&gt; THE WORLD CUP OF SOCCER,
[4:28] &gt;&gt; THE OLYMPIC GAMES.
[4:32] &gt;&gt; SORRY, my friend.

[4:35] pastor.
[4:37] &gt;&gt; Let me handle this thing now.

[10:21] &gt;&gt; THE FEEL OF THINGS.
[10:22] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY YOU FEEL IT.
[10:24] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY YOU SEE SOMEBODY AND SOME
[10:26] CAN'T TAKE IT. THEY SAY they take a
[10:28] screenshot on uh on WhatsApp on
[10:32] Instagram to SHOW THE PEOPLE HOW MUCH
[10:34] THEY ARE SUPPORTING SO AND SO such and
[10:37] SUCH TEAM BECAUSE THEY ARE CAUGHT UP
[10:39] INTO THAT SPIRIT.
[10:41] &gt;&gt; It's an anointing that you got into it.
[10:45] &gt;&gt; Brother Brham says THEY ENTER RIGHT INTO
[10:48] THE FIELD OF THE THINGS AND DO WHAT? AND
[10:50] DO WHAT?
[10:50] &gt;&gt; BECOME A PART OF THINGS.
[10:52] &gt;&gt; You become part of the things.
[10:54] &gt;&gt; BUT OH HOW THEY HATE
[10:58] THE WHO?
[10:59] &gt;&gt; THE CHRISTIANS.
[11:00] &gt;&gt; FOR WHAT?
[11:01] &gt;&gt; GETTING INTO the spirit of God's word.
[11:10] &gt;&gt; IN CHURCH, YOU NEVER SAY AMEN. YOU
[11:12] SITTING LIKE THIS. YOU SITTING LIKE
[11:15] THIS. YOU SITTING LIKE THIS. BUT IT'S
[11:17] NOT WO.
[11:19] WHICH SPIRIT IS IN IT?
[11:22] &gt;&gt; IN THIS CHURCH, WE GET IN THE SPIRIT OF
[11:24] THE MESSAGE.
[11:25] &gt;&gt; AMEN. WHEN THEY PREACH THE WORD, WE ALSO
[11:28] ARE JUMPING.
[11:29] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[11:30] &gt;&gt; WE ARE SAYING AMEN.
[11:32] &gt;&gt; WE ARE JUBILATING BECAUSE WE ARE IN THE
[11:34] SPIRIT OF THE WORD.
[11:35] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[11:40] &gt;&gt; WHICH SPIRIT ARE YOU UNDER?
[11:43] &gt;&gt; Come on, Lord.
[11:47] &gt;&gt; Which spirit ARE YOU UNDER?
[11:49] &gt;&gt; WHICH SPIRIT ARE YOU UNDER?
[11:52] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[11:53] When the word was coming back with
[11:55] David,
[11:56] &gt;&gt; what was David doing?
[12:02] &gt;&gt; WHAT WAS DAVID DOING?
[12:03] &gt;&gt; DANCING BECAUSE of what? THE MUSIC ONLY?
[12:07] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE OF THE WHAT?
[12:08] &gt;&gt; THE ARK OF THE COVENANT. THAT'S THE
[12:11] DIFFERENCE BETWEEN US AND PENTECOSTAL.
[12:16] &gt;&gt; PENTECOSTAL. WE JUST SEE THE MUSIC BUT
[12:19] NOT THE WORD. IN THIS CHURCH, BOTH THE
[12:22] MUSIC AND THE WORD MAKE US TOGETHER.
[12:27] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[12:33] &gt;&gt; Listen to this, my friend.
[12:36] &gt;&gt; I'm just in the middle.
[12:38] &gt;&gt; We're talking about sport
[12:40] &gt;&gt; with your Marion Brum.
[12:42] &gt;&gt; TODAY,
[12:44] &gt;&gt; THEY WANT AN educational system.
[12:47] &gt;&gt; WHY? SO THEY can do anything they want
[12:50] to
[12:51] &gt;&gt; and do what?
[12:52] &gt;&gt; And still hold their Christian
[12:54] profession.
[12:54] &gt;&gt; IN OTHER WORDS, PEOPLE that leave the
[12:56] church and go live any kind OF WAY,
[13:00] &gt;&gt; DON'T TOUCH THEM, DON'T REBUKE THEM, and
[13:03] then next time they they come to church
[13:04] to do their religion.
[13:06] &gt;&gt; That's what people love in this message.
[13:10] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND STILL HOLD THEIR CHRISTIAN
[13:13] PROFESSION. OH, IF THEY GOT A GREAT BIG
[13:16] something where you can go in, go down
[13:19] the line and things and do what?
[13:21] &gt;&gt; Chew chewing gum.
[13:23] &gt;&gt; No one should be chewing gum in the
[13:25] church.
[13:28] &gt;&gt; Can you say amen?
[13:29] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[13:29] &gt;&gt; NO ONE SHOULD BE CHEWING A GUM DURING
[13:32] THE SERVICE.
[13:33] &gt;&gt; AMEN.

[13:34] &gt;&gt; The deacon heard you right.
[13:36] &gt;&gt; THANK YOU, JESUS. HE SAID, "AND CHEWING
[13:39] GUM AND KICK ONE ANOTHER IN THE WATER."
