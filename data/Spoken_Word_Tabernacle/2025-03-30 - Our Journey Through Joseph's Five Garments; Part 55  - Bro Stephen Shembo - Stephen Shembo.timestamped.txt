[7:44] like you
[7:46] Lord. Hallelujah this morning Lord God.
[7:50] Lord, we come into this house gathered,
[7:52] Lord, to bless your name. Lord Jesus, we
[7:55] thank you, Father, for the everything
[7:57] that you do for us each and every day.

[8:19] through here with your spirit, Lord, and
[8:22] just fill this place with your glory
[8:24] this morning, Lord God. Lord, as we
[8:26] prepare to hear your precious word, Lord
[8:29] God, we want to ask primarily, Lord,
[8:31] that you would touch the vessel by which
[8:33] it would come forth from, Lord God,
[8:36] bless our pastor, Lord, and just ask
[8:39] that you give him strength, Lord. He
[8:41] said he was loaded this morning, Lord
[8:43] God, and we're counting on it, Lord God.
[8:46] So, we want to be ready as well, Lord
[8:48] Jesus. Bless our musicians, Lord God,

[9:20] people, Lord, that you have chosen
[9:21] before the foundation of the world,
[9:23] Lord, to serve you, Lord
[9:26] God. And sometimes we forget what a
[9:30] privilege it is that you chose us and
[9:33] you called us,
[9:34] Lord. Forgive us, Lord. Forgive us for
[9:38] not giving you credit where it's due.
[9:40] Lord, we just want to just give you
[9:43] everything in our lives this morning
[9:45] once again, Lord, a
[9:47] rededication. And Lord, if there's some
[9:49] people here that are going through
[9:50] things which they might not understand,
[9:52] Lord, and it may hurt,
[9:57] [Music]
[9:58] Lord, we just want to lay before you,
[10:02] Lord. We just want to ripen in your
[10:04] presence, Lord.
[10:07] So we thank you,
[10:08] Father. We thank you for everything that
[10:11] we go through,
[10:13] Lord, good or bad, Lord, for we know and
[10:17] we trust you, Lord, that it's for our
[10:20] good. Lord, so may you manifest yourself
[10:24] to us this morning, Lord. We give you
[10:26] all glory, honor, and praise for each
[10:29] person sitting here, Lord, and for each
[10:32] one that may be online.

[27:02] request, Amen. Oh, this was this was

[27:09] because it was that's all we had. So, it
[27:12] was another birthday wish for Sister
[27:14] Carolyn. Amen. Amen.
[27:17] Amen. Praise
[27:19] God. We'll let Sister Kayla, she's got
[27:22] some a couple testimonies here. She said
[27:25] she'd keep them short. So, good luck to
[27:28] you.
[27:31] No, no. When God's good, you know what
[27:33] I'm saying?
[27:36] So, I'll give the shorter of the three
[27:38] because there are three. Um, as I gave
[27:42] the testimony Wednesday, the Lord
[27:43] blessed me with a work from home job,
[27:45] which I was discussing with Sister Edie
[27:47] and praying about. Um, but it it it
[27:50] entailed 40 hours of training this week
[27:53] and an exam on Friday. So, my brain was
[27:56] fried, but I passed it.
[27:59] So, I thank the Lord for that.
[28:03] Um, and then on top of that, I had
[28:06] scheduled this class to take which
[28:08] required a state exam before the Lord
[28:10] opened the door for the job. I had that
[28:12] Saturday, but I passed my state
[28:18] exam. Thank you.
[28:23] And even though those are small
[28:25] victories, the largest victory
[28:27] is we've been going through a battle of
[28:30] renovation with a a childhood home of
[28:33] ours. And you know, the ministry
[28:35] preached to us that right before the
[28:37] blessing comes, there's a hiccup or a
[28:40] bump in the road. And you know, we thank
[28:43] the Lord for our brothers and sisters in
[28:45] Christ. Brother Zach came out and looked
[28:47] at the HBAC unit and happened the
[28:49] Saturday before brother the Lord allowed
[28:51] brother Steven to preach it um about the
[28:53] air conditioning and I was just like
[28:54] just something else. I just want the
[28:56] contractors out. I'm done. I'm
[28:59] tired. But I thank honest people for
[29:02] being in our lives. He came he checked
[29:05] it out for us and he said, "Brother
[29:07] Charles, sister Kayla," he said, "Looks
[29:09] like someone intentionally cut the wires
[29:11] to the HBAC in." And I said, "Lord,
[29:14] we're right here at the end, and it's
[29:15] just this could potentially cost a lot
[29:18] of money to be fixed." And we dealt with
[29:20] someone that was supposed to come out to
[29:22] the home and look, but due to
[29:23] scheduling, it didn't happen. And you
[29:26] know, like brother Kelly said Wednesday,
[29:28] you know, the God rises up in you and
[29:30] you just get tired. And I said, "Lord,"
[29:33] I said, "We don't need anyone else. The
[29:35] AC is going to be fine and it's time to
[29:37] move." And he put in my heart what our
[29:40] son ministered, you know, his car. He
[29:42] said, you know, to everyone, it may seem
[29:44] this way to you guys, but to me it it
[29:47] means a lot. And so I grabbed hold to
[29:50] that and I used that and petition the
[29:52] Lord. And I said, Lord, I said, this is
[29:54] for our family. We are obedient. We are
[29:57] diligent. I said, Lord, I said, this has
[29:59] to break. The devil has to go. And we
[30:02] went to the we got the call. I said, by
[30:04] the end of the month, we're going to get
[30:05] this call. And Thursday night, my
[30:07] husband came in town from work. Thursday
[30:10] night, we got the call. Contractor's
[30:11] out, air condition fine. We started
[30:14] cleaning Saturday. So to God be the
[30:16] glory.
[30:20] Amen.
[30:23] Hallelujah.
[30:27] Amen. Isn't it wonderful? Isn't it
[30:29] wonderful to to witness the the the the
[30:33] miracles, Amen. in someone's life and
[30:35] just it gives us strength. Let's Yes,
[30:38] ma'am.
[30:42] Okay, hold on. If you can't help it, we
[30:44] want to hear it.
[30:47] I didn't think I would, you know, I

[32:44] across.

[33:06] gods. You're the one that said, "Ye are
[33:10] gods and I dwell amongst of mighty,
[33:14] mighty conquerors." Oh Jesus, we don't
[33:18] have words this morning to express the
[33:22] way we feel this morning. Father, we
[33:24] thank you for all the testimonies, Lord.
[33:28] May you multiply them. Oh, dear God, you
[33:32] said the works that I do will you do
[33:35] also, and here we are, Father, you're
[33:38] not a man to lie. That's why you're
[33:41] fulfilling your promises towards us,
[33:44] Father. Oh God, take our pastor in the
[33:47] back. May you bring him out. Oh God,
[33:50] take the man to the side and come and
[33:52] speak the words of life to us. Lord,

[57:35] into it can go many directions. I will
[57:38] try to stay on the main line. So, let's
[57:40] stay focused by God's
[57:43] grace. Verse six. I have
[57:45] said you are gods and all of you are
[57:50] children of the most high. You might be
[57:52] seated. But you shall die like who? Men
[57:57] and fall like what? One of the princes.
[57:59] So these are dual beings. Amen. You know
[58:03] that. You know, you understand this
[58:04] pretty good, right? Amen. They are
[58:07] gods and they are also human.
[58:12] Amen. 100% God. And 100% human. Amen.
[58:19] 100% deity. Right. And 100% natural.
[58:26] This is very important. Are we together?
[58:29] Amen. Are we together? Amen. So now
[58:32] buckle up and follow me carefully.
[58:36] You ready? Amen.
[58:39] In Genesis, I did this to help you
[58:42] up, but you need your Bible. in Genesis
[58:46] 1.
[58:50] God of
[58:51] heaven, please help us. Amen.
[58:56] In Genesis
[58:58] 1 verse 14, the Bible says, "And God
[59:04] says, let there be light in the
[59:08] firmament of the heaven."
[59:12] This word firmament here means the
[59:14] cloud.
[59:17] We went through the mystery of the three
[59:20] heavens. I don't think it's on YouTube.
[59:23] I will find if it's uh not on YouTube.
[59:25] We can post it on YouTube if you want to
[59:27] review. Brother Brandham called this
[59:29] heaven the first heaven because there's
[59:32] three heaven. But let's leave it alone.
[59:35] Let's stay focused. Okay. The point the
[59:38] Bible say God say let there be light in
[59:42] the firmament. That's right. There's
[59:44] many direction we can go here. Amen.
[59:47] Remember God already say let there be
[59:49] light.
[59:51] And then here God begin to say let there
[59:53] be light.
[59:57] You see that? But follow me my friend.
[1:00:00] The Bible say let there be lights in the
[1:00:03] firmament of the heaven.
[1:00:06] Let's make this
[1:00:08] easy. This is the world. You remember
[1:00:11] this from question and answer.
[1:00:14] The world was a ball of ice. Yes. You
[1:00:19] remember that, right? The world, the
[1:00:22] earth came from the sun.
[1:00:26] And he was hot. Yes, sir. And I was, as
[1:00:29] he was moving away from the sun, the
[1:00:33] temperature begin to cool off. That's
[1:00:35] right. You following me clearly? Those
[1:00:37] who wear glasses understand. Amen. If
[1:00:40] you are here and it's under AC, air
[1:00:44] conditioning, if you go outside, what
[1:00:47] happened to your glasses?
[1:00:49] Fogs is water. We clear my friend. So as
[1:00:53] the sun begin to move away, as the earth
[1:00:56] begin to move away from the sun, the
[1:00:58] earth begin to cool off.
[1:01:01] We together. As it begin to cool off,
[1:01:04] what happened? Moisture begin to be
[1:01:07] created. Yes. All of this I can go coat
[1:01:10] after coat after coat. I'm trying to
[1:01:13] stay on the surface. That moisture
[1:01:15] created water. Are we together? The
[1:01:19] further the earth was away from the sun,
[1:01:22] the earth ended up being filled with
[1:01:25] water.
[1:01:28] Everybody okay? Are we together? That's
[1:01:31] why the Bible say in Genesis
[1:01:34] 1:2 that the spirit of the Lord, are we
[1:01:38] together? Enter into the earth and begin
[1:01:42] to move upon the face of the water, the
[1:01:45] face of the deep.
[1:01:47] [Applause]
[1:01:49] If I lost you, raise your hand. Amen.
[1:01:51] Are we together? Amen. Then God divided
[1:01:55] the water from the waters. That's right.
[1:01:58] That's right. Amen. Am I reading a
[1:02:00] different Bible? If not, we open the
[1:02:03] Bible and you going to take me to a
[1:02:04] different route. The Bible say that God
[1:02:07] separate the water from the waters. Are
[1:02:11] we together? So God, the spirit of the
[1:02:14] Lord came and divide this water. Follow
[1:02:18] me my friend. As this water was divided,
[1:02:23] a portion of the water was taken up.
[1:02:27] That's right. Amen. Are we together?
[1:02:28] Amen. As this portion of water was going
[1:02:32] up, Amen. it begin to turn into vapor.
[1:02:37] Amen.
[1:02:39] It was no more liquid.
[1:02:41] Until it reach a certain atmosphere,
[1:02:45] then it became clouds. Amen.
[1:02:49] Everybody okay?
[1:02:52] Everybody okay? And the Bible say now
[1:02:55] there was water above
[1:02:57] and water below. Yes sir. Are we
[1:03:00] together? Are we together? Then
[1:03:07] God glory to God.
[1:03:10] Can I erase this water now? Now we got
[1:03:13] water that is called here
[1:03:16] cloud. This is called cloud and this is
[1:03:19] still water. Are we together? Then the
[1:03:23] Bible say this water that is left here,
[1:03:26] God divided this water with the earth.
[1:03:31] Amen. Are we together? Are we together?
[1:03:35] So one part this water was taken into
[1:03:38] one side and the earth appear.
[1:03:43] Are we together? The part that the water
[1:03:46] was taken, the Bible call that the sea.
[1:03:49] Amen.
[1:03:51] And the other part now where there was
[1:03:54] no water was called the earth.
[1:03:59] Both of these would take you to
[1:04:00] Revelation 10 and everything. You will
[1:04:02] see that all of that. That's right. One
[1:04:04] foot on the sea, one foot on the land.
[1:04:06] All of that are here. Are we together?
[1:04:09] This right here is what you call the
[1:04:12] sky.
[1:04:14] If you go outside right here and you
[1:04:16] look up there, you will see sometime
[1:04:18] it's bluish or whatever it is the sky.
[1:04:22] The Bible call this firmament.
[1:04:28] Any question so far? We clear so far? We
[1:04:32] clear so far.
[1:04:35] The sun was created before this.
[1:04:39] You need a prophet. That's right. Are we
[1:04:42] together? When this water begin to go
[1:04:45] up, it created again a darkness on the
[1:04:49] earth because this water blurred the
[1:04:54] universe.
[1:04:56] Amen. Amen. I'm saving you time, my
[1:04:58] friend. Are we together? So that's why
[1:05:02] God came on the third day. The light was
[1:05:05] already created. And God say, now read
[1:05:08] with me, let there be light. Let there
[1:05:11] let there be what? Light. Light where?
[1:05:13] In the firmament of the not light in the
[1:05:16] universe. Light was already there. The
[1:05:19] sun was already created. But light
[1:05:21] where? In the firmament. Are we
[1:05:24] together? Outside of this earth. You got
[1:05:27] the sun, you got your moon, whatever
[1:05:30] everything is over. You got the star
[1:05:32] over there. Amen. But you cannot see
[1:05:35] them because of this right here.
[1:05:38] Right. Amen. We clear now. God say let
[1:05:40] there be light where in the family
[1:05:44] so that when you look at the sky the sky
[1:05:47] now became a glass
[1:05:50] a screen
[1:05:54] that you can see and watch the zodiac
[1:05:57] you can see and see the star
[1:06:00] are we together have I lost somebody
[1:06:04] the Bible says in verse 14 God say let
[1:06:08] there be light in the firmaments of the
[1:06:11] heaven. God want light to appear right
[1:06:13] here to do what? Divide the day from the
[1:06:16] night. And let them be what? For signs.
[1:06:19] Uh-huh. And for what? Seasons. And for
[1:06:22] what? Days. And for what? Years. What I
[1:06:24] want you to understand is God is the one
[1:06:27] that introduced seasons.
[1:06:33] Amen. Are we together? Are we together?
[1:06:37] So season is not something in eternity.
[1:06:41] [Applause]
[1:06:44] Please preach with me. Did you sleep
[1:06:47] well? Did you sleep well?
[1:06:52] If not, I tell the deacon to be
[1:06:54] patrolling left and right. Did you sleep
[1:06:57] well? Season is not something from
[1:07:00] eternity. No, sir. Season is under
[1:07:04] heaven.
[1:07:08] Are we together?
[1:07:11] In this earth here, we got seasons.
[1:07:15] Is season singular or plural? Plural.
[1:07:20] Are we together? So if you are outside
[1:07:24] this earth, come on brother. Amen. You
[1:07:27] are not subject to season.
[1:07:30] [Applause]
[1:07:33] Glory to God. Amen. Are we together? If
[1:07:37] you are outside this earth,
[1:07:43] you are not subject to season.
[1:07:47] But if you are inside the earth,
[1:07:54] there is a purpose why I read this the
[1:07:56] scripture. You are subject to what?
[1:07:59] Seasons. Everybody. Okay. Amen.
[1:08:07] Okay. Verse 15. And let them be for
[1:08:12] what? Lights in the firmament of the
[1:08:14] heaven. To give light where? Upon the
[1:08:16] earth. And he was. So remember light was
[1:08:19] already created. The first thing
[1:08:24] God removed the darkness. Now God again
[1:08:26] sent the light to light the earth. Verse
[1:08:29] 16. And God made how many lights? Two
[1:08:33] great lights. You know who they are. I'm
[1:08:36] going to help you up. The great light to
[1:08:39] rule when the day. It is called what?
[1:08:42] The sun.
[1:08:45] Amen.
[1:08:47] Isn't the Bible beautiful?
[1:08:49] The sun. Continue my friend. And what?
[1:08:52] And the lesser light to rule the night
[1:08:55] which is called what? The moon.
[1:09:01] So on planet earth, how many are living
[1:09:04] on planet earth?
[1:09:10] How many?
[1:09:12] Okay. So on planet earth we have days,
[1:09:18] we have nights,
[1:09:20] we are subject to the light of the sun,
[1:09:23] and we are subject to the light of the
[1:09:25] moon. Any questions so far?
[1:09:28] Now after God created everything,
[1:09:33] God now created man. Follow me my
[1:09:37] friend. When God I put everything here.
[1:09:40] So let's focus here. So when God created
[1:09:43] man in Genesis 1:26, God say and God
[1:09:48] blessed them and God say unto them what?
[1:09:51] Be fruitful and do what? And multiply
[1:09:53] and do what? And replenish the earth and
[1:09:55] do what? And subdue it. and have
[1:09:57] dominion over water, the fish of the
[1:09:59] sea, over the foul of the air, and over
[1:10:01] water, every living thing that moveth
[1:10:03] upon the earth. If you notice, this man
[1:10:06] was not naturally it. No, sir. No, sir.
[1:10:10] He was created in the image and the
[1:10:12] likeness of God.
[1:10:16] He was a spirit man.
[1:10:18] Come on, brother. The natural man is in
[1:10:21] Genesis 2:7. We are still in Genesis 1.
[1:10:25] Are we together? Amen. And God say,
[1:10:28] "Behold, I have given you what? Every
[1:10:31] herbbearing seed which is upon the
[1:10:34] water, the face of all the earth and
[1:10:36] every tree in which is what? The fruit
[1:10:38] of a tree yielding seed to you it shall
[1:10:44] future.
[1:10:45] Because the man cannot eat yet,
[1:10:49] [Music]
[1:10:51] brother. Are we together, my friend? Put
[1:10:53] your seat belt. I'm trying to take off.
[1:10:55] Are we together? The man cannot eat yet.
[1:10:59] That's why God say he shall be careful
[1:11:02] with the Bible. You need a prophet.
[1:11:06] Amen. Are we together? Amen. Are we
[1:11:09] together? Amen. He shall it shall be for
[1:11:12] what? So this man here was both male and
[1:11:16] female.
[1:11:18] [Applause]
[1:11:20] Are we together? And God called male and
[1:11:24] female Adam. Yes sir. Both of them one
[1:11:28] name.
[1:11:30] Are we together? Are we together?
[1:11:35] Lord. Adam is created.
[1:11:38] Is male
[1:11:41] and he's also what? And what I'm showing
[1:11:45] here is God gave them a diet.
[1:11:50] Come on, brother. Amen. Yes, he did.
[1:11:51] That's right. Amen. So, man in the
[1:11:54] garden of Eden was eating of what?
[1:11:57] Fruit.
[1:12:00] Fruit,
[1:12:04] seed, any question? Any question?
[1:12:09] Thank you.
[1:12:10] The Bible says now in Genesis
[1:12:14] 2:9 when the natural man is created and
[1:12:18] out of the ground made the Lord God to
[1:12:21] grow water. Every tree that is pleasant
[1:12:23] to the sight and good for what? Food. We
[1:12:26] clear now. The tree of what? Life also
[1:12:29] where? In the midst of the garden. And
[1:12:31] the tree of what? Knowledge of good and
[1:12:33] evil. So in the garden of Eden, we got
[1:12:36] three category of fruit of trees. Okay.
[1:12:40] Are we together?
[1:12:42] [Applause]
[1:12:43] We got the tree of life.
[1:12:48] Amen. We got the tree of the knowledge
[1:12:51] of good and evil. Are we together? And
[1:12:55] we got every tree. Amen.
[1:13:00] That's right. That's right. Your apple,
[1:13:03] your fig tree, your plum, whatever you
[1:13:06] want, it's under every tree. Amen. So,
[1:13:09] three category, tree of life, tree of
[1:13:12] good and evil, and every other tree.
[1:13:15] Everybody okay? Amen. And God told
[1:13:19] Adam in verse 16, "And the Lord God
[1:13:22] commanded to man, saying, of what? Every
[1:13:25] tree of the garden that may freely what?
[1:13:29] Eat,
[1:13:30] except which tree? The tree of life and
[1:13:33] evil. Uh-huh. Tree of what? Knowledge of
[1:13:35] good and evil. The knowledge of good and
[1:13:37] evil. So man had the right, follow me,
[1:13:41] my friend. To eat of every tree and to
[1:13:46] also eat of the tree of life.
[1:13:52] I'm going slowly. If I if I lost you,
[1:13:55] you tell me.
[1:13:58] Did I lose somebody?
[1:14:01] Man diet was the tree of life. Amen.
[1:14:05] Yes. Do you follow me? The spirit of the
[1:14:08] Lord is telling me something and I'm
[1:14:09] going to tell you it is the tree of life
[1:14:12] and every are the tree because man is
[1:14:17] [Applause]
[1:14:20] do. Amen.
[1:14:23] Are we together? This is what God just
[1:14:25] told me right now to tell you. Because
[1:14:28] God is doer. Man is doer. The deity need
[1:14:33] the tree of life.
[1:14:35] And the natural man need every tree.
[1:14:41] Are we together? Are we together? Are we
[1:14:45] together, brother? On the translation.
[1:14:48] If you tired, get my my brother to
[1:14:50] translate. I want this lesson to soak in
[1:14:53] so everybody really get it. Are we
[1:14:56] together? If you tired, get my brother.
[1:14:58] I want this to get in. These two trees
[1:15:02] here, this deal with deity and this deal
[1:15:06] with the natural man.
[1:15:09] Any problem so far? No sir. Any problem?
[1:15:12] No sir. So my point is there are season
[1:15:16] on the earth.
[1:15:18] Amen. Amen. And God gave man diet and
[1:15:22] the diet are fruits.
[1:15:26] Any question? Adam was living off
[1:15:29] fruits. That's right. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:15:34] I know you love steak. But let's go back
[1:15:36] to the beginning. Adam was living of
[1:15:40] what? Fruits.

[1:15:45] Amen. Everybody okay?

[1:16:04] us. Verse one, the Bible say, I saw a

[1:16:16] Amen. I saw a water, a new heaven, and a
[1:16:19] water, a new earth. For the first

[1:16:24] Passed away. And there was no more sea.
[1:16:29] Are we together? Take your time,
[1:16:32] brother. Are we together? Amen. On this
[1:16:34] earth,
[1:16:36] this earth, you got sea. But when we go
[1:16:40] back in the new Jerusalem into eternity,
[1:16:44] there won't be any more seas. Do you

[1:16:52] We got a new heaven.
[1:16:55] Amen. Amen. And a new what?
[1:16:59] So if this is new, what do we call this?
[1:17:05] I love this church. Old heaven and
[1:17:07] water. Are we together? But in the new
[1:17:11] heaven, the Bible say there is what? No
[1:17:14] sea.
[1:17:17] We clear in the old heaven there is a
[1:17:20] sea and there are season. Amen. Follow

[1:17:49] in it. And the lamb is what? The light
[1:17:52] thereof. In the city where the lamb is
[1:17:55] the light. Over here we got the sun and

[1:18:04] To divide the season.
[1:18:08] But over here we don't need no sun.
[1:18:12] Amen. No moon.
[1:18:17] Are we together? Glory to God.
[1:18:22] Going down to verse 25. And the gates of

[1:19:02] there is a revelation right here.
[1:19:07] There was a water, tree of life.
[1:19:15] spoken word. Can you swallow this?
[1:19:19] Can you swallow this?
[1:19:22] Brother Brandham said the tree of life
[1:19:24] was crushed.
[1:19:26] Are we together? In the new Jerusalem.
[1:19:29] Amen. There will be a river. Come on,

[1:19:34] Are we together? And in on in the midst
[1:19:37] of that river, there is a tree. Yes.
[1:19:42] But the Bible say this tree is on either
[1:19:45] side of the river. That's right.
[1:19:49] How can a tree be on either side of the
[1:19:52] river when it's in one place?
[1:19:56] Amen.
[1:20:00] Are we together? In other words, if you
[1:20:02] come on this side, you see the tree.
[1:20:08] If you come on this side, you see the
[1:20:10] tree
[1:20:12] but it's one tree.
[1:20:14] But you can see it on both side because
[1:20:18] Proverb Solomon say the tree of life is
[1:20:21] a she.
[1:20:23] It's written in the Bible.
[1:20:26] Come on Lord.
[1:20:30] He was one man, Adam. Right. But he was
[1:20:33] male and female. It is one tree, Christ.
[1:20:38] But Christ is male and female.
[1:20:42] It is one tree, the tree of life, but he
[1:20:45] have a branch of a male and a branch of
[1:20:48] a female. You can see it on both side.
[1:20:55] Are we together? Have I lost somebody?
[1:20:58] No, sir. Have I lost somebody? No, sir.
[1:21:02] The Bible says that on either side of
[1:21:05] the river was there the what? Tree of
[1:21:07] life. Do you see the tree of knowledge
[1:21:10] of good and evil? Here. No.
[1:21:13] So in the new heaven and earth,
[1:21:16] there is no tree of knowledge of good
[1:21:18] and evil because the devil is already
[1:21:21] put on the lake of fire. Are we
[1:21:23] together? No tree of good and evil, but
[1:21:27] the tree of life that was here is still
[1:21:31] on the other side.
[1:21:35] We got the tree of
[1:21:39] life. Lord, help me. The Bible says that
[1:21:43] the tree of life which bear 12 manners
[1:21:47] of what? Fruit.
[1:21:54] Adam in the first earth was feeding on
[1:21:58] what? Fruits. That's right.
[1:22:02] Are we together? When we go back to the
[1:22:05] new earth and new heaven there is of
[1:22:08] tree of life with how many manner of
[1:22:10] fruit? 12.
[1:22:13] 12 fruit.
[1:22:15] How many month do we have? 12.
[1:22:18] 12 month. Amen.
[1:22:20] Amen.
[1:22:23] We together. Amen. And the Bible say and
[1:22:26] yielded her fruit water every month.
[1:22:32] [Applause]
[1:22:36] I hope we are okay. On this earth here,
[1:22:40] you got season.
[1:22:43] [Music]
[1:22:44] Fruit don't come every month.
[1:22:47] That's right, brother. Amen. I hope we
[1:22:50] are together. But over there there is no
[1:22:53] season. There is no night. There is no
[1:22:56] moon.
[1:22:58] There is no sea. There is not even a
[1:23:01] night
[1:23:02] and every month.
[1:23:06] The tree is producing fruit
[1:23:10] because of a dead time has season.
[1:23:14] [Applause]
[1:23:18] Are we together over here? There is no
[1:23:21] time
[1:23:23] because we back in eternity and there is
[1:23:26] no season.
[1:23:30] This is your deduction, brother Stephen.
[1:23:33] Where did the prophet say that?
[1:23:38] Brother Brham says in the message
[1:23:40] question and answer in 1964
[1:23:43] he was talking answering about the
[1:23:45] seals. Brother Brham said the seals
[1:23:48] never ended time. Come on brother
[1:23:51] because the seal the seven one take you
[1:23:53] and ushering you into the millennium.
[1:23:56] Are we together? Brother Bronham say
[1:23:58] time or season until
[1:24:04] after the what? Millennium. So in the
[1:24:06] millennium we still under time
[1:24:09] because it's a thousand year. There is
[1:24:11] time. But once we pass the millennium
[1:24:14] there is no more ages.
[1:24:16] No more time. No more season.
[1:24:20] Time and season stop at the millennium
[1:24:24] because God want to prove the devil. Yes
[1:24:26] sir. That man may live a thousand year
[1:24:30] without sin.
[1:24:33] Amen. Are we together? Amen. Are we
[1:24:35] together? Amen.
[1:24:38] Brother say no. It still be water time
[1:24:43] until after what the millennium.
[1:24:46] We clear now. So in the new earth no
[1:24:49] sea, no need of sun, no need of moon, no
[1:24:54] night, no tree of knowledge of good and
[1:24:56] evil. Only the tree of life. But the
[1:24:59] tree of life is producing fruit.
[1:25:03] Amen. Not steak,
[1:25:05] fruit.
[1:25:07] And the fruit is every month. Are we
[1:25:10] together? Are we together? Are we
[1:25:13] together? Brother Brandham says this in
[1:25:16] the future home in paragraph 425. He
[1:25:19] say, "Oh, what? Holy mountain."
[1:25:22] Continue, my friend. There will be
[1:25:23] streets of transparent gold. Uhhuh.
[1:25:25] Avenues and houses and parks. If you
[1:25:29] want to read this, Revelation 21:18,
[1:25:33] uhhuh. The tree of life will be there.
[1:25:36] Continue. 12 different manners of fruit.
[1:25:39] Uhhuh. One each month will be bore on
[1:25:42] it. Let's go slowly. The people that eat
[1:25:45] this fruit, they shall change their diet
[1:25:49] every month.
[1:25:54] I'm reading the prophet.
[1:25:58] Is that too strong? Every month you have
[1:26:01] a different menu.
[1:26:05] In other words, Adam is back again.
[1:26:11] Amen. Are we together? But without
[1:26:14] season.
[1:26:16] Because over there every month you can
[1:26:18] go to a tree and you can find fruit. But
[1:26:22] not on this earth here. This earth has
[1:26:26] season.
[1:26:29] Amen. Shake somebody, my friend. Are we
[1:26:32] together? Are we together? So why are
[1:26:36] you saying all of this?
[1:26:41] What is the purpose of all of this?
[1:26:46] In the book of Mark,
[1:26:49] chapter 11:E3,
[1:26:58] I'm giving you time to soak in.
[1:27:02] Can I continue? Amen. Can I continue?
[1:27:04] Amen. Can I continue? Amen. Ah, in the
[1:27:08] book of Mark 11 verse what? 13. The
[1:27:12] Bible speaks about Jesus
[1:27:17] and seeing a what? A fig tree where a
[1:27:21] far off having what? leaves.
[1:27:24] He came
[1:27:27] if happily in other word purchased.
[1:27:33] He may find what? Anything thereon. He
[1:27:36] was looking for fruit.
[1:27:38] Adam because Jesus is the last Adam.
[1:27:44] Jesus is the second and the last Adam.
[1:27:48] The first Adam feed on fruit. The second
[1:27:51] Adam is looking for fruit.
[1:27:59] Are we together?
[1:28:01] Are we together? Are we together?
[1:28:04] [Music]
[1:28:07] The Bible says, "And if happily he may
[1:28:10] find what? Anything thereon." And when
[1:28:12] he came to it, he found what? Nothing
[1:28:14] but leaves. But leaves. For the time of
[1:28:17] what? Figs was not yet.
[1:28:21] [Music]
[1:28:26] The correct
[1:28:28] translation is the season of the fruit
[1:28:31] was not yet.
[1:28:34] How can Jesus make such a mistake?
[1:28:37] [Applause]
[1:28:42] Come on, brother. Preach now. Because
[1:28:43] Jesus was 100% God
[1:28:47] and 100% man.
[1:28:55] Does Jesus make a mistake? No sir. So
[1:28:58] there got to be a mystery right there.
[1:29:01] Are we together? Amen. Which clock is
[1:29:03] Jesus using?
[1:29:09] [Music]
[1:29:10] [Applause]
[1:29:12] But he was not the new heaven yet. He
[1:29:16] was not the new earth yet. So even Jesus
[1:29:19] must go through the season.
[1:29:24] [Applause]
[1:29:28] Are we together? Are we together? Are we
[1:29:32] together?
[1:29:34] [Applause]
[1:29:38] William Marion Brham.
[1:29:42] Brother Brandham say in the message what
[1:29:44] have faith in God. He said the story is
[1:29:47] very what striking as all Bible reader
[1:29:50] read much of the scripture knows what
[1:29:53] the instance Jesus came down from the
[1:29:56] hill as a what? A human.
[1:30:02] He was coming down as a what? A human.
[1:30:06] Hallelujah. Not as a god. Amen.
[1:30:10] As a human. A man who been what? Up all
[1:30:14] night fasting. He came down to find
[1:30:17] what? Something to eat. Looking where?
[1:30:19] On the tree. Now we could take that from
[1:30:21] a dozen different angle tonight. Amen.
[1:30:26] [Music]
[1:30:30] Amen. You can take it from different
[1:30:31] angle.
[1:30:33] Amen. Amen. Remember that tree is a fig
[1:30:36] tree.
[1:30:39] And what deceived Jesus if we can call
[1:30:42] it deception was the leaf.
[1:30:46] And the leaf of the fig tree is what
[1:30:50] Adam used in the garden of Eden to cover
[1:30:53] himself.
[1:30:57] And brother Brandham called the fig
[1:31:00] leaves religion
[1:31:02] and that's the problem in the message.
[1:31:06] We got a lot of religion on the outside
[1:31:09] but there are no fruits.
[1:31:16] [Applause]
[1:31:18] When you see them, you say, "This is a
[1:31:20] brother. This is a sister." When you get
[1:31:24] closer to them, they are backbiters,
[1:31:28] hypocrites, stabbing people in the back,
[1:31:31] and different liars, robbers.
[1:31:36] In this message, leave denomination
[1:31:39] alone. Let's deal with the message.
[1:31:48] Hallelujah.
[1:31:51] Full of religion.
[1:31:54] Long dresses.
[1:31:56] Ego here. Ego here. Ego here. Ego here.
[1:31:59] A hypocrite.
[1:32:01] [Applause]
[1:32:02] [Music]
[1:32:03] There is nothing wrong about long
[1:32:05] dresses. There is nothing wrong about
[1:32:07] having an ego. But we need to see some
[1:32:10] fruits. Amen.
[1:32:15] [Applause]
[1:32:18] Where is meekness? Where is gentleness?
[1:32:22] Where is longsuffering? Where is
[1:32:24] temperance?
[1:32:25] [Music]
[1:32:28] [Applause]
[1:32:33] Can we continue? Can we continue? Can we
[1:32:37] continue? Let me pull from that angle.
[1:32:41] Let me go back again on the highway.
[1:32:43] Let's go back and stay on the highway.
[1:32:45] Brother Brandham say you could take that
[1:32:48] from a what? A dozen different angles
[1:32:50] tonight. And being the Jewish what
[1:32:53] nation that was what curse because Jesus
[1:32:55] came and found no fruit in them. He
[1:32:58] found them in denomination.
[1:33:00] Pharisee,
[1:33:02] Sadducees, Herodogas. And we got
[1:33:05] denomination in this message. We got
[1:33:08] clicks.
[1:33:09] [Applause]
[1:33:17] clicks of move. We are under so and so.
[1:33:21] We are under so and so in this church.
[1:33:23] We are under the message.
[1:33:27] [Applause]
[1:33:29] [Music]
[1:33:33] Are we together? Are we together?
[1:33:36] Hallelujah. He says every what the word
[1:33:39] of God written is inspiration and it
[1:33:42] hooks the whole Bible together on every
[1:33:45] word in it is the most water is the most
[1:33:48] wonderful book that was ever written.
[1:33:50] Push the brake. So coming back to a
[1:33:52] highway we found out that the creator
[1:33:55] himself
[1:33:57] have to go by the season
[1:34:00] because he was not the new heaven. He
[1:34:03] was not the new earth. Jesus went as a
[1:34:06] human being, brother Brown. I'm saying
[1:34:08] and was looking for fruit.
[1:34:11] Are we together? As a human being, he
[1:34:14] didn't see fruit. Because as a human
[1:34:17] being, Jesus cried.
[1:34:20] That's right.
[1:34:23] Are we together? And the Bible say it
[1:34:26] was not the fault of the tree. The
[1:34:28] problem was the season. Then de kick in.
[1:34:34] [Applause]
[1:34:37] He moved from a human to a god.
[1:34:41] He spoke the spoken word.
[1:34:48] Are we together? Brother Brandham say he
[1:34:51] preached the gospel to that tree.
[1:34:59] Why? Come on. Why do you curse a tree?
[1:35:03] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:35:05] Brother Brandham say in the message what
[1:35:07] perfect faith. He say but Jesus live
[1:35:11] where? In a world that that what no one
[1:35:14] knowed about.
[1:35:16] That's right. He was what? An odd
[1:35:19] person. He lived in a world of what?
[1:35:22] Perfect faith in the water perfect God
[1:35:24] in which he was That's right. If we live
[1:35:28] in the water, perfect faith of a water,
[1:35:30] a Christian to what we are will be a
[1:35:33] what? A mystic to the world. The people
[1:35:36] would not understand you.
[1:35:38] [Applause]
[1:35:47] Walk how in the spirit what the spirit
[1:35:50] say you would do what he forbid you
[1:35:52] would not do then people begin to say
[1:35:55] the you be a what a mystic person to
[1:35:58] them that is the way it is to who all
[1:36:02] believers they are how a mystic the
[1:36:04] people what don't understand because
[1:36:07] they live in the world to what
[1:36:08] themselves Jesus live in the world that
[1:36:11] nobody else could touch amen the
[1:36:14] disciple could not understand him amen
[1:36:17] When he spoke to them, they say, "Why
[1:36:21] you talking riddles? We don't understand
[1:36:23] this. How can this be?" See, there was
[1:36:26] not in the world that he live in. See,
[1:36:30] they could not what understand him.
[1:36:32] Nobody could understand him. How can he
[1:36:36] go to a tree
[1:36:39] out of season looking for fruit? And the
[1:36:43] problem was not the fruit. The problem
[1:36:46] was the season.
[1:36:50] Are we together? Are we together?
[1:36:54] David says this.
[1:36:57] Psalm one very familiar. Let's go, my
[1:37:02] friend. Blessed is the manhu that
[1:37:04] walketh not in the counsel of the
[1:37:06] ungodly. Blessed is who? The man. So
[1:37:08] they talking about human being. No.
[1:37:11] Standeth where? In the way of sinners.
[1:37:13] No water siteth in the seat of the
[1:37:15] scornful. But his delight that man is
[1:37:18] where in the law of the Lord. And in his
[1:37:20] law do he the man meditate how? Day and
[1:37:23] night. He shall be like a tree which is
[1:37:27] planted by what? The rivers of water. If
[1:37:29] you notice there are many river but one
[1:37:31] word. Let's leave it alone. Are we
[1:37:34] together? Rivers of what? water that
[1:37:37] bringeth forth his fruit.
[1:37:41] When in his
[1:37:43] season it So even if you sitting by the
[1:37:46] river
[1:37:49] [Applause]
[1:37:51] of waters,
[1:37:53] you still under heaven.
[1:37:56] [Applause]
[1:38:05] Ah, if you want to, you want the quote,
[1:38:08] see me after church. Brother Brham say,
[1:38:11] somebody pull this. It is reverse
[1:38:16] plural of what?
[1:38:19] Brother Brandham say if you notice it's
[1:38:21] reverse plural of one word. And brother
[1:38:24] Brandham say it is the spirit of the
[1:38:27] Lord
[1:38:29] with nine gift
[1:38:31] [Music]
[1:38:33] nine river of one spirit and a tree is
[1:38:37] planted there.
[1:38:41] I don't know if we together. If you need
[1:38:43] the coach, you see me after church. Are
[1:38:46] we together? It is a tree that is
[1:38:48] planted by water. The rivers of water. A
[1:38:52] tree that is planted by the rivers of
[1:38:54] water,
[1:38:55] according to us, that tree should have
[1:38:57] fruit all the time. But David say no.
[1:39:00] That's right. Amen.
[1:39:04] Even though you are planted by the
[1:39:07] rivers
[1:39:09] of the water, you will bring fruit only.
[1:39:19] Even though you are full of the Holy
[1:39:21] Ghost,
[1:39:24] the gift are
[1:39:26] operating fruits are only in
[1:39:31] [Applause]
[1:39:33] I'm trying to help you. So the devil
[1:39:36] won't play game with you anymore because
[1:39:38] the devil is telling you why is God
[1:39:41] blessing you, speaking in tongue to you,
[1:39:44] but he doesn't do this for you. Tell
[1:39:47] him, "I'm a tree planted by the rivers
[1:39:52] of water." In my season,
[1:39:56] in my season, when my time's come,
[1:40:01] [Applause]
[1:40:04] [Music]
[1:40:07] [Applause]
[1:40:09] are we together? Amen. Are we together?
[1:40:12] Amen. Because we got a
[1:40:14] Pentecostal denominational
[1:40:16] understanding. That's right.
[1:40:19] Because I got the full anointing of God.
[1:40:22] So when I'm going steakhouse,
[1:40:26] McDonald speak the word. You get here.
[1:40:30] Even Jesus did not do that. He only does
[1:40:34] what the father shows him.
[1:40:37] [Applause]
[1:40:41] Yes sir. Because you are 100%
[1:40:45] and 100%. Amen. You need to know how you
[1:40:49] operating.
[1:40:51] [Applause]
[1:41:03] Can I say something?
[1:41:05] The fact that Jesus missed the season
[1:41:08] didn't remove deity.
[1:41:13] Yeah. In other words, even unlock deity.
[1:41:22] Are we together? Are we together? If
[1:41:25] you're sleeping, I'm wondering.
[1:41:28] Tell that demon, "Not now. I need to
[1:41:31] know about my season.
[1:41:35] Are we together? Are we together? So
[1:41:37] being planted by the river of water.
[1:41:42] Amen. All the non- gift are operating
[1:41:45] doesn't mean everything will happen at
[1:41:47] the same time.
[1:41:50] [Applause]
[1:41:52] Why is God telling you all these things?
[1:41:55] Why is God blessing you with all this
[1:41:57] revelation? But you don't see things.
[1:41:59] know the fruit will come in its season
[1:42:09] because you are not in here. You are
[1:42:13] still here. Even Jesus has to remember
[1:42:17] that he's still under the earth. He
[1:42:19] didn't follow the season.
[1:42:24] [Applause]
[1:42:25] Can I continue? Can I continue? Oh my
[1:42:29] God. The Bible say he shall be like
[1:42:31] what? A tree planted by the rivers of
[1:42:34] water that bringeth forth what? Fruit in
[1:42:36] his season. In what?
[1:42:41] Why are they using his for a tree? Come
[1:42:44] on now, brother. They're using his for a
[1:42:48] tree.
[1:42:50] They should have used it. Why are they
[1:42:53] using his? So that tree is a person.
[1:42:57] [Music]
[1:42:58] Yes, it is.
[1:43:00] [Applause]
[1:43:01] It's the man that doesn't sit with
[1:43:04] corners. The man that read the Bible
[1:43:07] every day, day and night, he meditate in
[1:43:11] the Bible. He's listening to the
[1:43:14] message. He's a tree planted by the
[1:43:18] river. How do you know you a tree? Look
[1:43:20] at what you're reading. Look what you
[1:43:23] feeding on. And if you doing that, don't
[1:43:26] mind anymore. There is a season.
[1:43:36] Amen. Glory, glory, glory, glory, glory.
[1:43:40] Are we together? Amen. Are we together?
[1:43:43] Amen. Oh my God. He will bring his fruit
[1:43:46] when in his season his what? Leaf also
[1:43:51] shall not wither.

[1:51:07] [Music]
[1:51:09] If it's the will of God for no, it is
[1:51:12] more better than if God would have say
[1:51:14] yes at that time.

[1:53:06] that God has. It's time and what? And
[1:53:09] sight. You look and neither one of them
[1:53:11] declare anything about God.

[1:53:24] bad things.
[1:53:27] God take his time a bad things and let's
[1:53:30] just believe whatever he said.
[1:53:34] [Music]
[1:53:36] It is taking too long. It is taking too
[1:53:38] long based on what?
[1:53:41] Because your friend got married.
[1:53:44] So they put pressure on you. Were you
[1:53:46] born in the same day?

[1:55:48] you saw where in a certain season and
[1:55:50] you reap where in a certain season
[1:55:51] because we under the heaven and there is
[1:55:54] a season when what the time comes that
[1:55:57] is right for things to what
[1:55:59] [Applause]
[1:56:01] happen. Amen. There is a season that the
[1:56:05] time will come for certain things to
[1:56:09] begin to happen.
[1:56:11] Amen. Amen. Read it again, my friend.
[1:56:14] Amen. Now Jesus here was speaking. He
[1:56:16] said, he said, "Father, the time has
[1:56:19] come." Uh-huh. Now there's seasons for
[1:56:22] everything. Uhhuh. Do you believe that?
[1:56:24] Uh-huh. You sow in a certain season.
[1:56:26] Correct. And you reap in a certain
[1:56:28] season. 25 miles an hour. And there's
[1:56:30] seasons when the time comes that's right
[1:56:33] for things to happen. Are we together?
[1:56:36] Put your seat belt, my friend. Amen.
[1:56:39] Everything
[1:56:41] has a season.
[1:56:44] Amen. Even the word of God has a season.
[1:56:49] [Applause]
[1:56:53] I told you put your seat belt. Put your
[1:56:56] seat belt. I told you put your seat
[1:56:59] belt. I don't have any choice. I'm going
[1:57:01] to release the missile.
[1:57:03] If I taught you this message,
[1:57:07] it will take what? No effect on you.
[1:57:13] I'm waiting. Put your seat belt. If I
[1:57:16] taught you you a what? A Methodist
[1:57:19] message. It would take what? No effect
[1:57:22] on you. This is what bride time.
[1:57:26] If Moses taught the message of Noah, it
[1:57:29] would take what? No effect. If Jesus
[1:57:33] [Applause]
[1:57:36] taught what Moses message, it will take
[1:57:38] what? No effect. Because the
[1:57:41] predestinated seed are laying there that
[1:57:45] will what only be watered by the top of
[1:57:49] water that is give for what? The seed
[1:57:53] [Music]
[1:57:54] [Applause]
[1:57:59] sir.
[1:58:00] Don't come in this church and read
[1:58:03] Charles Burton.
[1:58:06] [Music]
[1:58:07] [Applause]
[1:58:09] Don't come in this church and quote
[1:58:11] Luther.
[1:58:14] Don't quote Smith with the wife here.
[1:58:17] The message was good for that time.
[1:58:26] [Applause]
[1:58:28] Amen. Amen.
[1:58:30] Because the message of Luther will not
[1:58:32] make your seed to grow. Your seed is
[1:58:35] wired for another season. With another
[1:58:38] message, with another messenger, only
[1:58:42] that word can help your seed.
[1:58:51] So make sure here we quote only who?
[1:58:55] William Marian Brown. If a church remove
[1:58:59] brother, leave that church
[1:59:02] [Applause]
[1:59:05] [Music]
[1:59:07] because they are blocking you from the
[1:59:09] word of the season.
[1:59:17] He's my friend. We went with him in high
[1:59:20] school. He's my family member. So what?
[1:59:24] So what?
[1:59:26] Amen. We staying in church dying
[1:59:29] because of friendship, because of family
[1:59:32] ties, because we want to be in a certain
[1:59:35] environment when the word of the season
[1:59:38] is not there. What's the word of the
[1:59:41] season?
[1:59:45] [Applause]
[1:59:48] Some are even more hypocrite.
[1:59:51] They already understood that if they
[1:59:53] remove brother Brandham, they will lose
[1:59:55] the tithing. People will leave the
[1:59:57] church. So they caught brother Brandham
[2:00:00] superficially.
[2:00:01] But they don't go deep in the message.
[2:00:06] You who are following me online, your
[2:00:08] family is dying, your children are
[2:00:11] dying, and you still staying in that
[2:00:13] church, leave that church.
[2:00:15] [Applause]
[2:00:23] The message preached there won't help
[2:00:25] you. You are another caliber.
[2:00:31] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:00:34] Amen. He won't grow in what? Any other
[2:00:37] conditions. So, how do you expect people
[2:00:39] to grow in a church that looks like a
[2:00:40] Baptist?
[2:00:44] Let me put it again. How do you expect
[2:00:46] people to grow in a message church that
[2:00:49] look like a Presbyterian?
[2:00:51] [Applause]
[2:00:58] Hallelujah. We staying there to hang
[2:01:00] out.
[2:01:03] He says it must be what the conditions
[2:01:06] that grows it where the carcass is
[2:01:09] there. The eagle will be what? Gather
[2:01:12] where the carcass where the killing
[2:01:16] where the eagle will be what gathered
[2:01:18] where the fresh water me is the word of
[2:01:21] what the season there be what the eagles
[2:01:24] will gather where are you gathering
[2:01:27] which message is preached there how deep
[2:01:30] is that message preached
[2:01:33] we're not sympathizing we must believe
[2:01:36] the the pastor must believe and be
[2:01:39] convinced of the message before he
[2:01:41] preaches it.
[2:01:43] [Applause]
[2:01:46] If the pastor has question, the church
[2:01:49] won't grow. He
[2:01:54] become it become a cage of unclean
[2:01:58] spirit.
[2:02:02] [Applause]
[2:02:04] How can you preach the message? An
[2:02:07] uncleanness in the church. Boys are
[2:02:09] sleeping with church with girls and
[2:02:11] everything. Something is wrong. Let's go
[2:02:14] back to the pulpit.
[2:02:17] Let's check the pulpit. Do you believe
[2:02:19] the message? Because the message clings.
[2:02:23] The message change. The message
[2:02:25] transform.
[2:02:26] [Applause]
[2:02:36] We are stuck because of family. We are
[2:02:39] stuck because of friendship. We are
[2:02:41] stuck because I'm a white man and I have
[2:02:44] to be under a white man. I'm a black
[2:02:46] man. I have to be under a black man.
[2:02:49] Racist on both side. Racisting black
[2:02:53] people. Racisting white people.
[2:03:00] Hallelujah.
[2:03:02] You only survive when the church is is a
[2:03:06] black church. You only survive when the
[2:03:08] church is a white church. I wait for you
[2:03:10] in heaven. I will see which heaven you
[2:03:13] will get in because in heaven, African,
[2:03:18] American,
[2:03:19] Indian, Spanish, Canadian, everybody in
[2:03:24] the same
[2:03:25] place. A bunch of
[2:03:28] hypocrite. Hypocrit.
[2:03:32] Put me on Tik Tok. A bunch of hypocrite.
[2:03:40] All the preacher that preaches in your
[2:03:42] church are black people. All the
[2:03:44] preacher that preaches on your church
[2:03:46] are white people. And we see the whole
[2:03:48] love of God. Oh, how sweet you. Oh me.
[2:03:53] Which love of God? hypocritical love.
[2:03:59] [Applause]
[2:04:04] Listen to me. I'm not a I'm not a white
[2:04:07] man. I'm a black man, but I have no

[2:04:17] brother. I love him. I embrace him. I am
[2:04:21] proud to stand with William Marion
[2:04:24] Brana. I am proud.

[2:04:39] to? God will judge you. God will judge
[2:04:44] you. You are mine. God will judge you.

[2:04:50] [Music]
[2:04:51] [Applause]
[2:04:55] Are we together? Are we together? Are we
[2:04:58] together? The word must be the word of
[2:05:02] the season. As long as you give me the
[2:05:05] word, I don't care your color.

[2:06:11] The word of the season. Brother Brandham
[2:06:15] say this is another time God enlighted
[2:06:19] his word to what? Each age and as the
[2:06:22] age come along he sent what? Someone
[2:06:24] there to indicate that word to prove

[2:06:54] Because the word of God has a season.
[2:06:59] Are we together? Amen. He said, "And the
[2:07:01] Lord said, who then is thou what?
[2:07:03] Faithful and what? and wise steward whom
[2:07:06] his lord shall make water. Ruler over
[2:07:08] his household to give them their portion
[2:07:11] of meat in due season. Every age God has
[2:07:15] a portion. Give us the portion of our
[2:07:19] time.
[2:07:22] Who is a wise messenger? Who is a wise
[2:07:25] preacher? The preacher that will give
[2:07:28] you the portion for the season. And this
[2:07:31] season is the season of Malachi 4. Give
[2:07:35] us the message of Malachi 4. Give us the
[2:07:39] portion of God for this day.
[2:07:44] [Applause]
[2:07:46] Amen.
[2:07:47] Why?
[2:07:49] Why? Why, my friend?
[2:07:53] Because when you are in season,
[2:07:57] you don't push
[2:08:00] when your season come.
[2:08:10] I may shock some of you. Even if you
[2:08:13] didn't pray,
[2:08:15] [Applause]
[2:08:26] when your season come, it looks like the
[2:08:29] devil goes to sleep.
[2:08:33] I'm going to show you that, my friend.

[2:08:39] says in first in second king 4:16,
[2:08:43] this is Elisha talking to the to the
[2:08:46] woman. Elisha say about this season
[2:08:51] according to what? the time of life.

[2:08:55] love and time of life. We'll get with
[2:08:58] that with married couple.

[2:09:31] Elisha is giving that save the Lord. He
[2:09:35] look at the woman. He say what's her
[2:09:37] problem? She doesn't give birth.
[2:09:40] Elijah came. Elisha came. He say do you
[2:09:44] see this season here about this season?
[2:09:47] Yes sir. Amen.
[2:09:53] because he must give time for the
[2:09:54] pregnancy

[2:10:26] on February the 28th.
[2:10:28] [Applause]
[2:10:30] He was following the clock of a woman.
[2:10:33] The clock of the
[2:10:35] brother because it's a woman's circle
[2:10:39] and when he come in the club he's
[2:10:41] following that date and this year on
[2:10:44] February the 28th, seven planet ran up.
[2:10:53] on February the 20th to vindicate this
[2:10:56] message.
[2:11:00] [Applause]
[2:11:01] [Music]
[2:11:04] Are we together? Are we together? Are we
[2:11:08] together? Are we together? God says
[2:11:12] according to the time of Yah, thou shalt
[2:11:15] do what? Embrace the son. And she said
[2:11:18] to that saith the Lord. She says what
[2:11:21] name my Lord that man of God do not what
[2:11:24] lie unto thine handmade push the break.
[2:11:26] Did she believe? No
[2:11:30] [Applause]
[2:11:39] [Music]
[2:11:40] I need more time. You are taking my
[2:11:42] time. Did she believe?
[2:11:46] She's saying she's calling who liar.
[2:11:51] Under the anointing. When the prophet is
[2:11:54] under the anointing, he's no longer a
[2:11:56] man of God. He becomes
[2:11:59] [Applause]
[2:12:01] [Music]
[2:12:02] [Applause]
[2:12:05] God. Glory, glory, glory.
[2:12:09] Receive. Are we together? So, who's
[2:12:12] talking here? God drew a vessel and the
[2:12:17] woman is telling God what
[2:12:22] [Applause]
[2:12:25] it is.
[2:12:29] According to me and you,
[2:12:32] she lost the promise.
[2:12:35] It's not going to happen because she
[2:12:37] doesn't
[2:12:38] believe. But when the season
[2:12:42] came, the season didn't mind her
[2:12:45] unbelief.
[2:12:50] [Applause]
[2:12:52] Yes
[2:12:57] sir. Yes
[2:12:59] sir. Yes sir.
[2:13:03] I don't know if I will preach this
[2:13:05] season my friend. That's why brother
[2:13:07] Brandham say unbelief does not hinder
[2:13:10] God.
[2:13:11] [Applause]
[2:13:11] [Music]
[2:13:15] [Applause]
[2:13:19] God knows that you are human being. He
[2:13:22] understand you going through trial and
[2:13:24] grace
[2:13:25] over I mean overlap this
[2:13:31] thing. Jesus.
[2:13:37] He says, "And the woman did what?"
[2:13:40] Conceived. And what? And bear a son. At
[2:13:42] which season? At that season. That who
[2:13:45] Elisha had said unto her? According to
[2:13:47] what? The time of life. Because when the
[2:13:50] season come, it's no longer your
[2:13:52] problem. Matter of fact, it's not your
[2:13:55] season. It is God's season for you.
[2:13:59] So God is in charge, not you.
[2:14:04] [Applause]
[2:14:12] If you struggling with this, let me load
[2:14:14] you with this one. God came down to
[2:14:16] Abraham
[2:14:18] in Genesis 18.
[2:14:20] [Applause]
[2:14:24] He said, "Where is Sarah?"
[2:14:26] streak in it. Right.
[2:14:31] Pass passen
[2:14:36] [Music]
[2:14:37] and God say about the time of life Sarah
[2:14:43] I will come to Sarah
[2:14:46] search that coming in the Bible it's a
[2:14:49] secret coming
[2:14:52] I will come to Sarah and Sarah shall
[2:14:55] have a child what is Sarah
[2:15:01] Do you know what Sarah say? Sarah
[2:15:04] say the spinner shall cook with for him.
[2:15:08] He ate so much. Look how we begin to
[2:15:11] talk talk.
[2:15:21] Do you follow me? Do you follow me?
[2:15:24] Amen. Amen. And Elohim say, "Why did
[2:15:28] Sarah
[2:15:30] and Sarah in the face of God?" She said,
[2:15:33] "I didn't laugh.
[2:15:36] [Applause]
[2:15:44] No, because God's time will happen.
[2:15:48] [Music]
[2:15:54] Quit worrying. Quit worrying. There is a
[2:15:57] season.
[2:16:00] You don't push anything.
[2:16:03] It is effortless.
[2:16:06] You won't even boast of anything.
[2:16:08] [Applause]
[2:16:10] Amen. Praise the Lord. Because you know
[2:16:13] how many times you doubted God? But God
[2:16:16] didn't follow your doubt.
[2:16:18] God knew that you were man.
[2:16:21] [Applause]
[2:16:23] Amen. Can I continue? Can I continue?
[2:16:27] Can I continue? Amen. The Bible says in
[2:16:29] Luke 20.
[2:16:32] Thank you, Lord. The angel Gabriel, he
[2:16:34] said, "Beloved,
[2:16:36] thou shall be what? down.
[2:16:40] Zechariah,
[2:16:42] you going to have a child?
[2:16:45] Me,
[2:16:46] an old man like me. Ah, no.
[2:16:50] The angel didn't say you won't receive
[2:16:51] that child anymore.
[2:16:55] He say you will be dumb. So you don't
[2:16:57] testify negativity.
[2:16:59] [Applause]
[2:17:06] We don't want garbage out of your mouth.
[2:17:12] Glory and glory.
[2:17:17] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Because
[2:17:19] Zechariah, I have heard your prayer.
[2:17:23] I already heard your prayer. Now I have
[2:17:24] come down. The time has come. The season
[2:17:27] has come. And when God is coming, the
[2:17:30] one who was expecting begin to doubt.
[2:17:33] But because the season come, the season
[2:17:36] is removing unbelief.
[2:17:47] not able to speak until the day that
[2:17:50] these things shall be what? Performed
[2:17:52] because thy believeth not what? My words
[2:17:55] which shall be fulfilled when in their
[2:17:57] season.
[2:18:01] The word has a season. Amen.
[2:18:05] The word God is talking to you have a
[2:18:08] time. Amen. It will live from a
[2:18:11] preaching to become a life.
[2:18:15] There is a time what I'm preaching is a
[2:18:17] preaching. There is a time it will be a
[2:18:20] reality.
[2:18:22] [Applause]
[2:18:28] Hallelujah.
[2:18:29] Are we together? The Bible says in
[2:18:32] Galatian 5, "And let us not be what?
[2:18:35] Weary in welloing, for in what? In due
[2:18:38] season we shall reap.
[2:18:44] Amen.
[2:18:46] Let us not be what? Weary in what? In
[2:18:49] welloingo. Push the brake. Why are we
[2:18:51] weary in welloing? Because we are
[2:18:53] expecting reward quick. I did it.
[2:18:57] Nothing happened. You told me to give
[2:18:59] money. I give money to the poor. I'm
[2:19:01] still struggling financially. Don't be
[2:19:03] weary. Don't be. In due season, in due
[2:19:07] season, every offering you are giving to
[2:19:10] the poor, God will come back.
[2:19:14] [Applause]
[2:19:16] [Music]
[2:19:19] You are weary because you don't know a
[2:19:21] principle. There is a season. God is
[2:19:24] counting all of them.
[2:19:27] He won't forget it. No, he won't. Oh,
[2:19:30] glory to God. Ezekiel 34:26. And I will
[2:19:33] make them and the what places round
[2:19:36] about my he what? A blessing. And I will
[2:19:39] cause the shower to come down when in
[2:19:42] his season there shall be shower of
[2:19:45] what? Of blessing. So shower of blessing
[2:19:47] comes in the seasonal.
[2:19:51] [Applause]
[2:19:55] Which season are we in now?
[2:19:58] Spring. Okay. We're in spring. Okay. We
[2:20:03] are in spring, right? My
[2:20:05] question, if you don't pray for rain, do
[2:20:08] you think it won't rain?
[2:20:11] I'm asking you, if you don't pray for
[2:20:13] rain and most of us don't pray for rain,
[2:20:16] that does it stop the rain? Because the
[2:20:19] rain don't care about your prayers. The
[2:20:21] rain is following the creator. The
[2:20:24] creator say spring. When it spring,
[2:20:26] whether you pray or you don't pray,
[2:20:28] whether you leave the church or you
[2:20:29] don't leave the church, the rain still
[2:20:31] come.
[2:20:33] [Applause]
[2:20:34] s
[2:20:36] and the Bible is talking about shower of
[2:20:38] blessing. When the time come, when the
[2:20:42] season come, the shower of blessing will
[2:20:45] come.
[2:20:52] This is why you don't understand. You
[2:20:55] will see a certain time in your life you
[2:20:57] pray too much. You pray, you fasting,
[2:21:01] and you expect, you say, "This is the
[2:21:02] time. I'm going to get something." And
[2:21:04] it looks like nothing work.
[2:21:08] I'm talking to somebody. It looks like
[2:21:11] nothing work. And you say, "Let me push
[2:21:13] more prayer and you push, you push, you
[2:21:15] push, nothing work." Then suddenly you
[2:21:19] reach a certain period when you don't
[2:21:21] even pray pray too much. You pray just a
[2:21:24] little bit, but it looks like things
[2:21:25] begin to happen.
[2:21:28] Did it happen to you? You don't
[2:21:30] understand because the problem is the
[2:21:32] season. Your prayer line went up. But
[2:21:35] the prayer were waiting for the season.
[2:21:37] When the season come, it don't matter
[2:21:39] what you're doing.
[2:21:44] When the season come, you wanted to
[2:21:46] speak the word because you pray it
[2:21:49] happen. You do this, it happen. You do
[2:21:50] this, it happen. You do this, it happen.
[2:21:52] Full of faith.
[2:21:55] [Applause]
[2:21:57] It looks like blessing after blessing,
[2:21:59] blessing after blessing, blessing after
[2:22:01] blessing. The problem is a season.
[2:22:05] I can't catch it today.
[2:22:07] But maybe two weeks down the road, I
[2:22:09] will show you when the season come. How
[2:22:11] do you behave?
[2:22:16] Are we together? Are we together? Are we
[2:22:19] together? Are we together? Are we
[2:22:22] together? Amen. We found that in John 5
[2:22:26] verse4 the Bible for say for the for an
[2:22:29] angel went down where at a certain
[2:22:31] season into the pool. Hallelujah. My
[2:22:35] friend I have not touched purpose yet.
[2:22:38] I'm still with season. So you must
[2:22:40] season well. Even on the pool of
[2:22:42] Bethesda, the angel was not coming up
[2:22:45] and down, up and down, up and down. No.
[2:22:48] Amen. Season. And those people have to
[2:22:51] wait there. Yeah. And one was sick 38
[2:22:54] years.
[2:22:58] It's written in your Bible. He says,
[2:23:00] "And an angel went down at the water a
[2:23:02] certain season when into the pool and
[2:23:05] did what?" And troubled the water
[2:23:08] and let's continue. Whosoever then first
[2:23:11] after the troubling of the water stepped
[2:23:14] in was made whole. Stop right
[2:23:17] there. When the season come
[2:23:21] and the water are trouble, does the
[2:23:24] water care who's jumping?
[2:23:27] [Applause]
[2:23:29] I I I hope it's soaking when the season
[2:23:33] come, the water don't don't care who
[2:23:35] comes.
[2:23:38] Whether you tall or you short, the
[2:23:40] weather don't come. The the water is
[2:23:43] just waiting for the first one to get
[2:23:46] Amen. Amen. Can I continue?
[2:23:50] Let's Let's go again. He say, "And the
[2:23:53] trouble the water whosoever then first
[2:23:55] after the troubling of the water step in
[2:23:58] was made how?" Of what? Soever disease
[2:24:01] he had.
[2:24:04] Amen. I hope you getting that. When the
[2:24:07] season come, the identification of the
[2:24:10] disease was not a problem. Amen. In
[2:24:13] other words, the season don't care about
[2:24:15] the sickness. Amen. If it's cancer, if
[2:24:18] it's this, if it's kidney, if it's high
[2:24:20] blood pressure, diabetes, that's not the
[2:24:22] problem. When the season come, whichever
[2:24:26] sickness it is,
[2:24:31] the season take care of it.
[2:24:39] Oh, God. The Bible says, "And a certain
[2:24:42] man was there which had an infirmity."
[2:24:44] How many years? 30 and 8 years
[2:24:47] when Jesus saw him lie and knew that he
[2:24:50] has been there now for a what a long
[2:24:53] time in that case but Brandham say he
[2:24:55] was prostate right
[2:24:59] because he could fight his way up you
[2:25:01] need a prophet and then he said unto him
[2:25:05] if you have a prostate
[2:25:09] problem I hope you suck that one
[2:25:13] I hope you got that
[2:25:15] Ah, will that be made whole?
[2:25:19] The important man.
[2:25:22] Answer him. The Bible call him
[2:25:24] important.
[2:25:26] Sir,
[2:25:28] I have no man. Was that the answer?
[2:25:36] If you fool, I stop.
[2:25:39] Jesus asked him, "Will that be made
[2:25:42] what?" Oh, what is the answer? Yes or
[2:25:46] you begin to explain. Did they ask you
[2:25:49] explanation?
[2:25:51] The season don't need explanation.
[2:25:54] [Music]
[2:25:55] [Applause]
[2:26:04] Because the pool was there, but the
[2:26:07] season was changing.
[2:26:11] The God of the pool came with another
[2:26:14] season.
[2:26:18] He was a change of season from the pool
[2:26:21] to the person.
[2:26:24] Jesus was the pool himself.
[2:26:27] [Applause]
[2:26:29] He told the woman they were I will give
[2:26:31] you water that you don't know how to
[2:26:34] draw. He was a pool.
[2:26:39] [Applause]
[2:26:40] Are we together? Are we together? He
[2:26:44] says will that be made what? The
[2:26:47] question is yes or what? Listen to his
[2:26:51] explanation. Sir, I have no man when the
[2:26:54] weather is trouble to put me into the
[2:26:57] pool. But while I'm coming, another step
[2:27:00] down before me. Did they ask you all of
[2:27:02] this? No.
[2:27:07] Did Jesus get upset? Did Jesus pay
[2:27:11] attention to his blabbering sir?
[2:27:16] Amen.
[2:27:18] Because his season came.
[2:27:21] Whatever come out of his mouth that
[2:27:24] doesn't even line up.
[2:27:27] God don't hear it.
[2:27:31] Watch Jesus. Jesus didn't say, "Oh, so
[2:27:35] your case was hard."
[2:27:38] Oh man, I sympathize for you. Jesus
[2:27:42] didn't have time to waste. The father
[2:27:45] already gave him a vision.
[2:27:47] There is one that needed a season. Go
[2:27:50] there. Gave him his season and get out.
[2:27:53] Are we together? And the Bible say Jesus
[2:27:55] say unto him what? Rise and water. Take
[2:27:58] up thy bed and what? And walk. That say
[2:28:01] period. Amen.
[2:28:04] When the season come, you don't push.
[2:28:10] Amen. I hope we can swallow this, my
[2:28:12] friend. The Bible says in Luke 4 13,
[2:28:17] "And when the devil has ended what? All
[2:28:19] the temptation, he departed from him for
[2:28:22] a what?" A season.
[2:28:26] Amen.
[2:28:28] That's it. You don't get sick. You don't
[2:28:31] go to the hospital. You even forget
[2:28:33] there is a
[2:28:34] hospital because the season have come
[2:28:38] that God told the devil, "Push the
[2:28:40] break. He need a vacation from you.
[2:28:45] Amen.
[2:28:48] And you go outside without a mask, you
[2:28:50] don't get sick.
[2:28:52] Yes, sir. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[2:28:59] The devil departed for a season. And
[2:29:02] watch when the devil departed, what
[2:29:04] happened to Christ? The Bible say, "And
[2:29:06] Jesus returned in what? the power of the
[2:29:09] spirit into Galilee and they went out a
[2:29:12] fame of him throughout all the region
[2:29:15] round about because they put the devil
[2:29:17] into a custody
[2:29:19] [Music]
[2:29:21] they say Satan quiet this is a different
[2:29:24] season one your time in other word
[2:29:27] Christ had a season of temptation
[2:29:33] and there is a season you come out of
[2:29:35] temptationmen
[2:29:37] Amen. There is a time that you go
[2:29:40] through temptation and there is a time
[2:29:43] you will come out of a temptation.
[2:29:46] There is a time you waiting for the baby
[2:29:48] like Abraham. But there is a time you
[2:29:51] going to come out into a different
[2:29:53] season from winter to spring
[2:29:57] until
[2:29:58] [Applause]
[2:30:00] summer. Amen.
[2:30:04] Let me search how to land this ship, my
[2:30:06] friend. Are we together? Amen. Are we
[2:30:08] together? Amen. Are we together? Amen.
[2:30:11] Brother Brandham say
[2:30:13] he thought she was drunk. Talking about
[2:30:16] Hannah at the temple. They did the same
[2:30:19] thing on Pentecost. They do the same
[2:30:21] thing today. She said she was not drunk,
[2:30:24] but she was praying God to take away
[2:30:27] water. Her reproach and he blessed her.
[2:30:30] And as soon as she received the blessing
[2:30:32] from the priest, notice didn't wait. Now
[2:30:36] God could have put the baby in her arm
[2:30:40] right then.
[2:30:46] Brother Brandham say when Anna finished
[2:30:48] praying, God could have just brought the
[2:30:51] baby and say
[2:30:55] this is what we want.
[2:31:00] This is what we want. I come outside, I
[2:31:03] see a dealer with a car key.
[2:31:10] Are we together? God can do that.
[2:31:14] He's able to do that.
[2:31:19] He's able to do that. If your season
[2:31:22] comes,
[2:31:25] [Applause]
[2:31:27] the Bible br say God could have put in
[2:31:30] her arm what right then but she went
[2:31:33] home how happy knowing that in due
[2:31:36] season
[2:31:38] amen I hope we understand it I'm praying
[2:31:42] God is saying no you don't get trouble
[2:31:46] you don't get discouraged you go happy
[2:31:49] because you ship your Amen.
[2:31:52] You must trust the agency that my case
[2:31:56] will reach destination.
[2:31:58] Amen.
[2:32:04] [Music]
[2:32:06] Brother Daniel is back there. You trying
[2:32:09] to ship something from to brother
[2:32:11] Daniel. You go
[2:32:14] there and you go to the post office.
[2:32:16] There is overnight shipping. You know
[2:32:18] all of that. Yeah. And you pay a little
[2:32:20] bit more price. And they even give you a
[2:32:22] guarantee. A warranty. They say if it
[2:32:25] doesn't happen on the third day, we send
[2:32:27] you, you come back, we refund you the
[2:32:29] money. So the post office doesn't want
[2:32:31] to play again. Are we together? When you
[2:32:34] to go there and you pay money, expensive
[2:32:37] $60,000
[2:32:39] and then they give you the receipt and
[2:32:41] they say if it doesn't happen, come
[2:32:43] back. The post office won't lose that
[2:32:45] $60. No sir. He will make sure he keep
[2:32:49] the $60. So when you ship the package
[2:32:52] and they give you a receipt, what do you
[2:32:55] tell brother
[2:32:56] Daniel?
[2:33:00] You call him. You say, "Hey,
[2:33:03] how is everything?" "Oh, I already
[2:33:05] shipped the package, man. Just wait over
[2:33:06] there." You have faith. Amen.
[2:33:14] Amen. You have faith that the package
[2:33:17] have went. And if brother Daniel call
[2:33:20] you the second time, what do you keep
[2:33:21] repeating him?
[2:33:24] And if he bag you the third time, you
[2:33:26] take a screenshot
[2:33:30] of the receipt to tell him, "Stop
[2:33:33] bagging me." That's how you handle
[2:33:35] Satan.
[2:33:38] [Applause]
[2:33:42] Where is what you ask for? I already
[2:33:44] ship it
[2:33:47] because faith is the substance
[2:33:51] of things vote for and the evidence of
[2:33:55] things not see.
[2:33:59] Are we together? Are we together? Are we
[2:34:02] together? So when you ship the package,
[2:34:04] you go to sleep because the package is
[2:34:07] out of your control.
[2:34:10] Yes, sir. You're not going to go to the
[2:34:13] airport and stand and you say, "I want
[2:34:14] to see how the package is going."
[2:34:18] This is what we do. The Bible Brother
[2:34:21] say knowing that in do season God will
[2:34:24] do what? Bring it to pass. That is the
[2:34:27] kind of people we need
[2:34:29] today. Amen.
[2:34:32] Doing what? Taking God at his word. Why?
[2:34:36] Because it's going to happen. And if it
[2:34:38] doesn't happen now in due season,
[2:34:43] are we together? Are we together? My
[2:34:47] time is up. I have not touched the
[2:34:49] purpose yet.
[2:34:51] So, let me try to see how we going to
[2:34:53] maneuver and go to the airport. Buckle
[2:34:55] up, my friend. Flight attend and prepare
[2:34:57] for landing. Are we together? Brother
[2:35:00] Brham say he came time and what? One
[2:35:03] time for the children of Israel to do
[2:35:06] what? Be delivered from the Egyptian
[2:35:08] bondage. Are we together? Israel cried.
[2:35:14] Amen. Are we together? Israel prayed. Go
[2:35:18] listen to the message teaching on Moses.
[2:35:21] Brother Brham will show you how Amram
[2:35:24] and Yed were praying.
[2:35:29] And it seems like the more they pray
[2:35:33] the more Pharaoh
[2:35:37] increase.
[2:35:40] Amen. Every day a whooping. Every day
[2:35:44] everybody comes home tired, worn out.
[2:35:50] And he was attacking men.
[2:35:54] Because when you wear a man out, You
[2:35:57] decrease the seed. That's the truth.
[2:36:00] That's the truth, brother. Because he
[2:36:02] was killing the baby and it doesn't
[2:36:03] work. Amen. Remember your Bible. So he
[2:36:07] say, "Let me take man and wear them."
[2:36:10] Amen. Amen. Amen. See on married couple
[2:36:14] minutes. Are we together?
[2:36:17] Are we together? He was wearing the men
[2:36:20] and things got worse.
[2:36:22] Is cry. Israel cry. On the other side,
[2:36:26] Moses is with sheep.
[2:36:30] Bear
[2:36:32] bear bear.
[2:36:34] He got a wife. Got two children. Free of
[2:36:38] worries.
[2:36:41] My life is good now. I came up from all
[2:36:44] those trouble, trouble, trouble,
[2:36:45] trouble. Now I'm far away from them. I
[2:36:49] left them with their fellowship. I'm
[2:36:51] here quiet on my corner minding my own
[2:36:55] business. You see how life is good?
[2:37:05] Show me where Moses prayed for the
[2:37:07] pillar for the burning bush.
[2:37:10] The burning bush didn't come because of
[2:37:12] Moses praying. Sir, the burning bush
[2:37:15] came because of the season.
[2:37:18] Amen. Amen. Amen.
[2:37:23] Are we together? Are we together?
[2:37:26] Hallelujah.
[2:37:28] I'm heading to the airport. When the
[2:37:30] time of the promise did what? True.
[2:37:33] None.
[2:37:35] It has nothing to do with you now. Are
[2:37:38] we together? Your praying time is over
[2:37:41] now. Now God step on the scene. That's
[2:37:44] why he told Moses, I have what?
[2:37:48] Where was God all along?
[2:37:51] It looks like he heard only now. Where
[2:37:53] was God all along when they were crying?
[2:37:55] Where was God? Do you think he was
[2:37:57] sleeping? Because the Holy One of Israel
[2:38:00] doesn't sleep nor slumber. But when he
[2:38:03] come to Moses, he say, I have heard.
[2:38:07] And I have done what?
[2:38:09] I myself came down. Why do Why didn't
[2:38:13] you come 30 years ago?
[2:38:19] Why? Why? Why? The devil thought The
[2:38:24] devil thought he can get you off the
[2:38:27] message.
[2:38:30] He didn't understand that God has
[2:38:33] another season in living word.
[2:38:37] [Applause]
[2:38:39] Come on. Amen. When the devil come
[2:38:42] crashing the church, God pulled the
[2:38:45] season up.
[2:38:47] from living word to spoken word.
[2:38:51] [Applause]
[2:38:57] Now look where you are. Do you want to
[2:39:00] go back there?
[2:39:04] [Applause]
[2:39:07] What did you do? Did you pray for
[2:39:09] another church? No. Did you pray for a
[2:39:12] building? No. What did you do for it?
[2:39:15] Did you pray for anything? Who's
[2:39:18] supplying?
[2:39:20] Who's bringing the key player? Who's
[2:39:22] bringing people? Pulling them from
[2:39:25] Georgia. Pulling this one from here.
[2:39:27] Pulling this one. Who's doing that? You.
[2:39:31] Because the season has come.
[2:39:36] [Applause]
[2:39:38] [Music]
[2:39:41] Let me wind up my friend as I'm landing.
[2:39:44] If you look on your window, you will see
[2:39:45] Charlotte, North Carolina. Are we
[2:39:48] together? Ah, the Bible brother pram say
[2:39:51] when the time of the promise did what?
[2:39:53] Drew nine. There raise up a pharaoh who
[2:39:57] did not know what? Joseph. How can a
[2:40:00] pharaoh I mean I mean who's here who
[2:40:03] doesn't know George Washington?
[2:40:07] I'm asking you who's here who doesn't
[2:40:09] know George Washington?
[2:40:13] Glory, glory, glory, glory, glory. Now
[2:40:16] somebody rose and they say I don't know
[2:40:18] George Washington.
[2:40:23] A pharaoh rose and say I don't know
[2:40:26] Joseph after everything Joseph did. A
[2:40:29] preacher just rose and say William
[2:40:31] Marion brother is a liar.
[2:40:35] I thought you the one that saw the
[2:40:37] picture. I thought you were there. What
[2:40:40] happened to you? No, the problem is the
[2:40:43] season came.
[2:40:45] [Applause]
[2:40:48] The season came. We didn't know the
[2:40:51] season has come. We were worried about
[2:40:54] our comfort zone. God say, "I got
[2:40:56] something better."
[2:41:00] [Applause]
[2:41:07] Can I continue? I'm about to land the
[2:41:09] ship, my friend. The plan. He says they
[2:41:12] raise up a what of Pharaoh. Who? Who did
[2:41:15] not know Joseph? Why
[2:41:21] brother? I thought you believe brother
[2:41:23] Brandham. No, it's a lie. Everything
[2:41:26] they say was not true.
[2:41:30] Am I dreaming or what? No, you don't
[2:41:35] understand.
[2:41:36] A season has come and brother Brandham
[2:41:39] say why is a Pharaoh rising up and just
[2:41:43] don't know Joseph.
[2:41:45] Brother Brandham say why? Why the season
[2:41:48] was there? Thank you Lord. Amen. So when
[2:41:52] the season come, God make different
[2:41:56] maneuvers
[2:42:01] because the Bible say he make everything
[2:42:05] according to his own purpose.
[2:42:09] That's right. You wonder why this is
[2:42:11] going this way. Don't worry. He's in
[2:42:13] control.
[2:42:16] The season has come.
[2:42:20] Amen. Are we together? He says the
[2:42:23] season was what? They respected Israel
[2:42:27] until that time.
[2:42:31] You a Jew.
[2:42:34] Now you a Jew.
[2:42:38] What happened?
[2:42:40] What happened?
[2:42:42] What happened? Because the Exodus has
[2:42:45] come.
[2:42:47] Amen. Amen. They must begin to shake you
[2:42:52] so that you can get prepared and your
[2:42:54] mind begin to get prepared to leave the
[2:42:57] comfort zone.
[2:43:00] The job that you love so much suddenly
[2:43:03] problem
[2:43:04] [Music]
[2:43:06] problem because they want you to get
[2:43:08] out.
[2:43:10] Hallelujah.
[2:43:14] Hallelujah.
[2:43:16] He said they respected Israel until
[2:43:18] what? That time, but the season was
[2:43:21] there for no more respect.
[2:43:24] Jesus,
[2:43:30] we will touch purpose. Sister called
[2:43:33] this season. Are we together? He says,
[2:43:36] but the season was there for what? No
[2:43:38] more respect that God could shower down
[2:43:43] his judgment upon the people.
[2:43:47] The time had come. That is what the
[2:43:50] devil tries to do all the time. Burn you
[2:43:53] up
[2:43:56] on something. Make you what? Sicker when
[2:43:59] you prayed for. Sicker when you prayed
[2:44:01] for. Make you think you have what? Lost
[2:44:04] your experience with God. He's what?
[2:44:06] Lying to you. The times come when you
[2:44:09] got to stand on what? God's word. And
[2:44:12] stand how? Alone. But when that time
[2:44:15] come, do what? Stand there. There is got
[2:44:18] to be a time when you got to separate
[2:44:22] yourself between your feelings and your
[2:44:25] faith.
[2:44:30] [Applause]
[2:44:36] The time has come that you must separate
[2:44:39] what? Your feelings. From what? Your
[2:44:41] faith. Forget about your feelings.
[2:44:48] [Music]
[2:44:49] Are we together? Are we together? Are we
[2:44:53] together? We gave too much time to the
[2:44:55] feelings. Crying, crying, depressed,
[2:44:58] depressed. That time is over.
[2:45:04] The time has come. Lord, separate your
[2:45:07] feeling.
[2:45:10] It hurt me so bad. It hurt me so bad.
[2:45:13] Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. You're going to
[2:45:15] have heart problem.
[2:45:18] [Applause]
[2:45:24] Can you imagine? Can you imagine? He
[2:45:26] hurt so bad. We were friend now he does
[2:45:31] away. The time has come.
[2:45:34] We must separate the feeling from a
[2:45:37] faith. Me I believe the message I stand
[2:45:42] for the faith. The time of feeling is
[2:45:44] over.
[2:45:54] Why should I be heartbroken all the
[2:45:56] time? And when you heartbroken, what
[2:45:58] does he do? Does that change anything?
[2:46:01] You the one going to sleep crying and
[2:46:04] and and that rascal is laughing.
[2:46:07] I'm not going to sleep crying when you
[2:46:10] laughing. You are anointed by the devil
[2:46:13] to torment me. I'm also anointed by God
[2:46:22] to live a peaceful
[2:46:24] life. Whether it rain or it doesn't
[2:46:27] rain, whether it's dark or it's not
[2:46:29] dark, the time has come to separate the
[2:46:33] feeling from your faith. That time is
[2:46:37] now. That time is when? That time is
[2:46:42] today.
[2:46:44] God bless you. Let's stop here.
[2:46:48] [Applause]
[2:47:05] [Music]
[2:47:07] Are we together? Save your health. Amen.
[2:47:10] Amen. Save your blood pressure.
[2:47:13] Save your heart.
[2:47:15] Save your mind.
[2:47:18] Before you go insane
[2:47:20] about people in this message trying to
[2:47:24] please everyone. Yes, brother.
[2:47:28] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:47:32] Trying to be approved by everybody.
[2:47:35] Try to be included by everyone.
[2:47:38] No sir. No sir. If what separate me is
[2:47:41] faith,
[2:47:45] if it's because of this message, so be
[2:47:51] it. Amen. Are we together? Amen. The
[2:47:55] time has come, brother Zach. The time
[2:47:58] has come to separate your feelings
[2:48:02] from your favor.
[2:48:06] Feeling cause us trouble. Feeling cause
[2:48:09] us discouragement. Feeling cause us all
[2:48:12] kind of questioning. God,
[2:48:15] the time has come. The season has come.
[2:48:19] Make a difference. You say
[2:48:22] feeling. If you want to continue, that's
[2:48:24] your problem. But me, I'm looking at the
[2:48:26] promise.
[2:48:27] [Music]
[2:48:30] I'm not going to cry because of you.
[2:48:33] If you trying to be mean, that's your
[2:48:35] problem. Because you might be a
[2:48:37] scorpion. So your life is always biting,
[2:48:40] biting, biting. I won't change you. So
[2:48:44] my life is a dove. And let me also live
[2:48:47] the life of a dove.
[2:48:51] [Applause]
[2:48:56] In other words, grow up.
[2:48:59] Put your big pants on. Stop crying. Stop
[2:49:03] being a crybaby.
[2:49:05] [Applause]
[2:49:08] [Music]
[2:49:11] Tell that devil, I won't cry.
[2:49:17] It didn't happen.
[2:49:19] Yeah, it didn't happen because it's not
[2:49:21] my season. It doesn't mean God didn't
[2:49:24] hear me. God told me he hears my prayer.
[2:49:28] And God told me he take his time. And
[2:49:30] God told me he works everything and
[2:49:33] makes everything beautiful in his own
[2:49:35] time. My responsibility is to believe.
[2:49:38] [Music]
[2:49:43] Are we together? Are we together? The
[2:49:46] time has come. separate your feeling
[2:49:49] that little petty feeling and you
[2:49:51] offended and when you offended you
[2:49:54] punish the message when you offended you
[2:49:56] punish the church I won't go to church
[2:49:59] because so and so offend you so so and
[2:50:01] so has a power to dictate my life and my
[2:50:04] religion
[2:50:10] [Music]
[2:50:12] some people told me they said brother
[2:50:14] Steven you left leave I the whole
[2:50:17] church. Do you see what they post
[2:50:18] online? I say you wasting your time.
[2:50:20] When I left that church, I block them. I
[2:50:23] block them. I block them. I don't want
[2:50:26] to see what they doing because they have
[2:50:29] another agenda. I have my agenda. I'm
[2:50:32] walking in the different light.
[2:50:35] [Applause]
[2:50:36] Why should I watch what they doing and
[2:50:39] be trouble all the time?
[2:50:42] Hallelujah. I have too many fishes to
[2:50:45] fry. That's right. Too many message to
[2:50:48] listen, too many lessons, too many too
[2:50:51] many sermon to prepare for spoken word.
[2:50:55] Why should I waste my time on you?
[2:50:58] [Applause]
[2:51:05] Let's pray. Heavenly Father, Lord, we
[2:51:08] are approaching you humbly this
[2:51:09] afternoon. Amen. Father, we thank you
[2:51:12] for your grace, for your love, for your

[2:51:45] and to stabilize them to understand that

[2:51:53] season and you have a purpose for
[2:51:56] everything that concern our lives.

[2:52:04] of your children. Amen. May Lord Father
[2:52:06] this be the
[2:52:08] season that they will rise up
[2:52:12] and be delivered from whatever they have
[2:52:14] been going through. Amen. Lord, may this
[2:52:16] be the the season of their visitation.
[2:52:20] May this be the season where things will
[2:52:23] begin to move in a different direction.
[2:52:25] Lord,
[2:52:27] Father, whatever they going through,
[2:52:29] visible and visible audience, you know
[2:52:32] what they're going through. But I pray
[2:52:34] that you take over from here. Lord, I
[2:52:37] have done what I can do. But you know
[2:52:40] the remaining father, I bless them in
[2:52:43] the name of Jesus Christ. May Lord,
[2:52:45] father, you give them beyond what they
[2:52:47] expect. Amen. And protect us in the name
