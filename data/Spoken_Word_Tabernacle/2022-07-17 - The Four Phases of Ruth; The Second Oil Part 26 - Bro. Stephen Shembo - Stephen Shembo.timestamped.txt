[53:11] i said what is happening to me
[53:14] when i sat down i began to meditate the
[53:17] holy spirit opened he first reminded me
[53:21] on what i told you on wednesday and he
[53:24] opened it in the way that i'd never seen
[53:26] it before
[53:28] i was looking for who to vent i say let
[53:31] me go to the young people
[53:34] you hear them laughing i took it i put
[53:36] it in symbols form
[53:38] i wrap it up in symbols and drop it
[53:40] there so probably they're still thinking
[53:43] about it amen
[53:45] you won't get that you need to be in a
[53:46] young people chat
[53:47] [Music]
[53:50] amen
[53:51] how many are up to date with the sermon
[53:56] blessed be the name of the lord how many
[53:58] are still reading the cod book
[54:01] brother jim if we would we might need to
[54:03] order the
[54:05] 70 weeks of daniel somebody two people
[54:07] already finished
[54:09] if i'm not mistaken so we can give it to
[54:10] them and they can move on amen
[54:12] blessed be the name of the lord
[54:14] yesterday
[54:16] my god
[54:18] if you miss it for legitimate the reason
[54:20] i understand it
[54:22] but
[54:24] we answer the question what is the
[54:26] evidence and the proof that you have the
[54:29] holy ghost
[54:32] i didn't know how to answer it it came
[54:34] right on the spot so i have to sit home
[54:37] and record everything
[54:39] that i spoke yesterday because i never
[54:41] seen it like that
[54:43] so those who were there
[54:45] found somebody who was there yesterday
[54:47] and asked them a question what is the
[54:49] evidence and the proof that you got the
[54:51] holy ghost they will tell you
[54:53] because brother branham said it's love
[54:55] but i'm saying this brother branham said
[54:57] this we took all the code and we put it
[55:00] together in one shot so if you miss it
[55:03] my friend talk to somebody amen blessed
[55:06] be the name of the lord my godness my
[55:09] goodness we talk about thanksgiving
[55:12] we talk about valentine
[55:15] we talk about halloween
[55:17] we talk about christmas and we show you
[55:20] how to detect every feast
[55:23] every celebration and how you can agree
[55:25] with it or reject it
[55:31] we went in the scripture we took the
[55:32] feast of the jews until the book of
[55:35] esther
[55:36] my friend i can't help it
[55:38] amen
[55:39] we even talk about the financial aspect
[55:47] he was there yesterday so you miss it
[55:52] amen
[55:53] my goodness i have couple
[55:56] people they are married people they ask
[55:59] me based on what was answered yesterday
[56:02] if we can have a couple meetings
[56:08] so i tell them
[56:10] get your question write them down
[56:12] for them and say this is for couple
[56:15] meetings and you put it in the box
[56:17] because the sister does that the put
[56:18] question they do that the put question
[56:21] they'll fold it and they say this is for
[56:23] the system meeting so i know how to
[56:24] separate my envelope whether it's a
[56:26] house meeting system meeting or couple
[56:29] meetings so put your question if i see
[56:31] it that it comes i have 10 or 15
[56:34] questions then we organize for the
[56:36] couple and we go through it
[56:41] are you scared
[56:45] the way the holy ghost was working
[56:48] yesterday
[56:49] i went home tired like i was preaching
[56:54] because i knew it was the anointing that
[56:56] was here yesterday amen so put your
[56:58] question and we move on with that our
[57:01] question and answer will be august the
[57:03] 20th not the 13th the 20th because we
[57:07] already booked the clubhouse
[57:09] so we don't depend on the weather
[57:11] whether it's raining or not we'll be
[57:13] safe everybody care so august the 20th
[57:17] you can work with your manager your
[57:18] supervisor and tell them you got
[57:20] question and answer amen
[57:23] that you you know what to do you do it

[57:43] stay in prayer everything will be all
[57:46] right amen
[57:47] we need grace today you only have one
[57:50] service
[57:51] so let me unload what is coming up we
[57:54] okay are we ready
[57:57] amen
[57:58] let's stand
[58:04] glory to god
[58:07] oh my god
[58:08] i have this quote on
[58:10] friday
[58:12] so if you miss yesterday don't think i
[58:14] put this code for you
[58:17] it came on friday
[58:19] i was usually when i meditate brother
[58:22] branham keep playing 24 hours that's
[58:24] right and most of the time whatever is
[58:26] coming from brad branham is matching
[58:28] exactly the slide
[58:30] so i got it on friday if you missed
[58:32] yesterday this is not for you for your
[58:35] rebuke
[58:38] we okay now brother branham say if you
[58:40] are around here in the city anywhere
[58:43] near do water
[58:45] in other words don't stay home
[58:47] we want to assembly and gather ourselves
[58:50] together
[58:51] we want to set
[58:53] under the teaching of our brother here
[58:56] brother
[58:58] he was what
[59:00] and partake of the things that is of god
[59:04] as he found them from god
[59:06] he gives them out
[59:08] and we want to learn off
[59:11] and seeing that they are approaching we
[59:13] must assembly ourselves more often more
[59:16] of together we must love
[59:20] kama in our heart come out to do what
[59:23] [Music]
[59:25] that's it
[59:28] i'm going to read it again
[59:30] we must love in our heart to come to
[59:34] if we don't love church
[59:38] love
[59:40] coming together what we call church is
[59:43] coming together to do what
[59:45] if we love christ we worship again
[59:50] you cannot love god and sit at home
[59:53] when i will preach about the rest of
[59:55] israel the rest of the church i will
[59:58] show you why do we worship on sunday
[1:00:03] why we have to be in church on sunday
[1:00:06] and you will learn from there on
[1:00:08] whatever you have on sunday
[1:00:10] push it aside
[1:00:12] make sure you finish church first
[1:00:16] and you do what you got to do for god
[1:00:18] first
[1:00:19] and god is more gracious to you because
[1:00:21] he gave you only one service so after
[1:00:23] church is over then you go to your
[1:00:26] restaurant and fellowship or do what you
[1:00:28] do but never put pressure
[1:00:31] on sunday it doesn't belong to you
[1:00:34] that's why brother branham
[1:00:36] was talking about fishing on sunday
[1:00:38] [Music]
[1:00:40] have you heard about it i have caught
[1:00:42] the body i'm already loaded i know what
[1:00:44] i'm talking about you heard brother brad
[1:00:46] i'm talking about not even selling tips
[1:00:48] on sunday
[1:00:50] there is a reason why brother branham
[1:00:52] say that we're going to go through the
[1:00:54] scripture and you will see sunday in the
[1:00:56] different view so sunday don't bring
[1:00:58] your birthday friend that you have to
[1:01:00] meet in the restaurant forget about it
[1:01:03] do the worship first
[1:01:07] [Music]
[1:01:08] don't worry i know where i am man you
[1:01:11] imagine a man saying he loves his wife
[1:01:14] and had not seen her for her
[1:01:16] brother branham is comparing this to
[1:01:18] come to church
[1:01:20] pass by pass rabbis by and say well i
[1:01:24] see her at the other time that is not or
[1:01:27] wife saying she loves her husband or
[1:01:29] parents saying they love the children
[1:01:31] well it shows
[1:01:32] how does he show by the way you go to
[1:01:34] church and i think our expressions that
[1:01:37] we should constantly long to be in
[1:01:41] constantly
[1:01:44] anyway
[1:01:45] to worship the lord when we come
[1:01:48] together to worship him worship him at
[1:01:51] worship him while we are
[1:01:54] wherever we are worship
[1:01:58] i do stream that's normal that's an
[1:02:01] emergency window
[1:02:03] do you remember you two kiss do you
[1:02:06] remember
[1:02:07] when paul was preaching he was sitting
[1:02:09] on the window and he fell asleep
[1:02:12] so you keep staying on the streaming all
[1:02:14] the time don't want to come to church
[1:02:16] you're going to fail at sleep
[1:02:18] [Music]
[1:02:21] because he was sitting on the window he
[1:02:23] was only streaming he doesn't want to
[1:02:25] come to church
[1:02:26] oh i cannot make it on wednesday night
[1:02:28] because i can't drive at night don't you
[1:02:30] have a parties at night
[1:02:34] don't go to reception at night
[1:02:41] amen all right let's go to our sermon
[1:02:46] somebody needed it i got it on friday
[1:02:49] another sunday no not on saturday so
[1:02:52] don't come and say no i didn't show up
[1:02:53] yesterday that's why i'm getting a
[1:02:55] whooping no
[1:02:58] roof chapter 3.
[1:03:02] i have to tell you the truth
[1:03:05] and the truth will set you free
[1:03:09] some of the deliverance just need a
[1:03:11] little something that you show god and
[1:03:14] god delivers you amen
[1:03:16] amen you want deliverance you don't give
[1:03:19] god preeminence in anything and you
[1:03:22] still want him to bless you
[1:03:25] if he bless you you're going to run away
[1:03:26] from church
[1:03:28] because you're already struggling to
[1:03:30] church
[1:03:35] even if you are not here you travel
[1:03:38] where you are
[1:03:39] make sure on sunday go to church if
[1:03:42] there is a church there
[1:03:45] amen
[1:03:46] you don't stream city oh no i was
[1:03:48] streaming you streaming on your tower
[1:03:51] wearing a tower

[1:04:37] good you played in a car
[1:04:40] but you're watching the sign of
[1:04:41] mcdonough

[1:04:51] brother branham said angel stays in
[1:04:53] church
[1:04:56] amen
[1:04:58] then naomi said to her mother-in-law

[1:05:11] shall i not seek rest for you that he
[1:05:14] may be well with you i told brother
[1:05:17] caleb to erase the board because what

[1:14:03] not one husband
[1:14:08] not one husband
[1:14:11] it's just a man
[1:14:12] not a husband so there is no covenant
[1:14:16] they're going to take a hold of one man
[1:14:19] one
[1:14:21] man
[1:14:22] a man
[1:14:24] not a husband
[1:14:25] one man
[1:14:27] saying we will eat our own bread
[1:14:32] because they're dealing with a man
[1:14:34] they're not dealing with a husband
[1:14:36] you don't tell a husband i'm going to
[1:14:38] eat my own bread

[1:15:54] are connecting to one man
[1:15:57] not one husband
[1:15:59] everybody okay

[1:16:02] this is it the bible says in isaiah 30.
[1:16:06] moreover the light of the moon you

[1:16:10] shall be as the light of the water
[1:16:13] so when you look at this moon
[1:16:15] this moon exactly look like water
[1:16:19] so you can look at the moon and call
[1:16:21] that the sun
[1:16:23] amen
[1:16:27] okay
[1:16:28] no worry
[1:16:29] he says
[1:16:30] he shall be as the light of the sun
[1:16:33] and the light of the sun
[1:16:35] shall be seven-fold
[1:16:40] brother branham says this
[1:16:42] he says seven
[1:16:44] is the complete number of god
[1:16:48] representing water
[1:16:51] the seven days of water
[1:16:54] and isaiah says this sun shall be
[1:16:58] sevenfold as the light of how many days
[1:17:01] the seven days of what
[1:17:04] seven is god completed in
[1:17:07] seven

[1:17:11] church ages
[1:17:13] he made the world in
[1:17:16] seventh day he rested
[1:17:18] that is his last number in his creation
[1:17:23] in other words this sun
[1:17:26] that will look like the moon is the sun
[1:17:29] that have reached
[1:17:32] its sabbath
[1:17:36] okay
[1:17:37] this is not the sun of one day
[1:17:40] it is not the sun of two days
[1:17:42] it is not the sun of three days it is
[1:17:45] the sun of seven days in other words
[1:17:47] this sun have reached a rest
[1:17:53] or a sabbath
[1:17:55] or the sun
[1:17:56] has reached its climax
[1:18:01] it's completion
[1:18:02] there is no more the sun can do anymore
[1:18:06] [Music]
[1:18:09] everybody okay
[1:18:10] so this resting sun
[1:18:13] the moon
[1:18:14] will look like the sun that is resting
[1:18:20] [Music]
[1:18:22] the moon
[1:18:23] will look like the sun that is sleeping
[1:18:29] roof will look like borah sleeping
[1:18:34] roof will look like boas taking a rest
[1:18:42] [Music]
[1:18:44] praise god

[1:21:37] and those that are streaming online in
[1:21:39] the name of jesus christ amen
[1:21:43] everybody okay so far all right now we
[1:21:46] come back again on our subject
[1:21:48] the four phases of roof the second
[1:21:52] oil lord help me to get into the
[1:21:56] second oil amen
[1:21:58] in our tabernacle journey here we are in
[1:22:02] the holy of holies everybody okay
[1:22:05] and in the holy of holies we enter
[1:22:08] according to roof into the threshing
[1:22:11] floor everybody okay now when we talk
[1:22:14] about the threshing floor last sunday we
[1:22:17] found out that the trenching floor
[1:22:19] number one was a place that they were
[1:22:22] separating the shock everybody okay
[1:22:26] form the seed everybody okay because he
[1:22:28] was the time of the brother number two
[1:22:32] we found out that the threshing floor
[1:22:35] had a hidden cavalry
[1:22:37] you remember that
[1:22:39] somebody's quiet
[1:22:40] a hidden cavalry and a hidden temple
[1:22:45] anybody here because in the trashing
[1:22:47] floor of ornan
[1:22:49] we found out that that was the place
[1:22:51] that abraham sacrificed isaac and that
[1:22:54] was the same place that solomon came and
[1:22:57] built the temple so it started from
[1:23:00] calvary all the way to the feeling of
[1:23:02] the holy ghost in the temple of god
[1:23:05] which is the bride of jesus christ
[1:23:08] when i continued to look around the
[1:23:10] threshing floor
[1:23:12] i found a little bit interesting that
[1:23:14] there is an ox
[1:23:16] connected with a woman there
[1:23:19] according to onan
[1:23:21] onan told david that
[1:23:23] the ox in the trashing floor can be used
[1:23:26] for burnt offering
[1:23:28] ever here and then the width of the
[1:23:32] trashing floor can be used for the meat
[1:23:35] offering so we have two offering here
[1:23:40] everybody okay
[1:23:41] that have been unfolded
[1:23:43] in the threshing floor we have the burnt
[1:23:46] offering everybody okay
[1:23:49] and then we have the
[1:23:51] meat offering
[1:23:53] everybody okay
[1:23:54] the burnt offering is represented by the
[1:23:58] ox here
[1:24:00] which gonna be as beast of sacrifice and
[1:24:03] the meat offering right here is
[1:24:05] represented by the wheat
[1:24:08] everybody okay
[1:24:10] now in leviticus 16
[1:24:13] verse 14 we found that there is
[1:24:15] something really
[1:24:17] strange
[1:24:18] about the offering of the ox
[1:24:22] the ox
[1:24:23] is what you call the bull
[1:24:27] and in the scripture it's sometime
[1:24:30] called the bullock
[1:24:32] yes
[1:24:33] everybody here so ox
[1:24:36] boo bullock it's the same thing
[1:24:39] now in leviticus 16 verse 14
[1:24:43] the bible said that when aaron
[1:24:47] come aaron which was the high priest you
[1:24:49] can read this at home
[1:24:54] let's start with the burn offering
[1:24:57] the burn offering we found that the burn
[1:24:59] offering is an ox which we call a bull
[1:25:03] or a bullock everybody okay
[1:25:05] now according to leviticus 16 aaron was
[1:25:09] the high priest
[1:25:12] everybody okay
[1:25:14] praise god buckle up my friend
[1:25:16] now the bible says that and he aaron
[1:25:21] shall take the blood of the bullock
[1:25:24] we're talking about the offering of an
[1:25:26] ox
[1:25:28] he will take the blood of the bullock
[1:25:31] when they kill it
[1:25:33] and sprinkle it with his finger
[1:25:38] so the high priest
[1:25:40] must use
[1:25:42] not his hand
[1:25:44] everybody okay he must use his finger
[1:25:49] and we know all of this assembles
[1:25:52] anybody okay he must use his finger
[1:25:56] upon the mercy seat eastward
[1:25:59] ever here
[1:26:00] and before the mercy seat shall he
[1:26:03] sprinkle the blood with his finger how
[1:26:06] many times
[1:26:11] so the offering of an ox
[1:26:14] was handled by the high priest
[1:26:18] and when he was handed by the high
[1:26:20] priest the high priest must use his
[1:26:23] finger
[1:26:25] everybody okay to sprinkle the blood
[1:26:29] of the bullock
[1:26:31] upon the mercy seat
[1:26:33] everybody care
[1:26:35] how many times
[1:26:42] glory to god
[1:26:44] brother upon him help me up a little bit
[1:26:46] brother probably interpret this
[1:26:48] scripture he says don't forget the word
[1:26:51] eastward
[1:26:54] where
[1:26:54] jesus is what coming from
[1:26:59] where is jesus coming from
[1:27:02] you know
[1:27:03] where does the sun rise
[1:27:07] everybody okay
[1:27:08] where will the srn rise
[1:27:11] where was the mercy seat sitting toward
[1:27:14] the east why have i got you all sitting
[1:27:18] this way towards the east
[1:27:24] so when they were building the tub and
[1:27:26] alcohol brother branham made sure the
[1:27:28] people were facing east
[1:27:34] are we okay
[1:27:36] are we okay brother bottom say why the
[1:27:39] altar is to the water because when you
[1:27:42] enter the tabernacle
[1:27:46] everybody okay
[1:27:47] the tabernacle the gate was on the east
[1:27:50] side
[1:27:51] and the altar here was on the west side
[1:27:54] everybody okay so far so the priests
[1:27:57] will come behind the mercy seat
[1:28:00] and dip his finger and he goes one two
[1:28:04] three four five six seven what does he
[1:28:08] mean
[1:28:09] with the blood of an ox
[1:28:11] brother bonham say he coded the same
[1:28:14] scripture sprinkle it eastward and
[1:28:17] before the mercy seed shall he sprinkle
[1:28:20] the blood with his finger how many times
[1:28:23] brother branham say isn't that beautiful
[1:28:27] seven times toward the east
[1:28:30] what is it
[1:28:32] the seven
[1:28:34] church edges
[1:28:36] shall be covered by the
[1:28:39] hallelujah
[1:28:41] jesus christ blood
[1:28:43] just as sufficient in it
[1:28:46] yesterday today and forever and to every
[1:28:50] to save every
[1:28:52] heal every
[1:28:54] bring every miracle every son to
[1:28:58] how many times
[1:29:00] think of it it was symbols how many
[1:29:02] times
[1:29:04] so brother branham said when the priest
[1:29:06] was sprinkling seven times he was
[1:29:08] showing that the seven church ages must
[1:29:11] be covered every church by a blood
[1:29:14] everybody okay
[1:29:15] so one day when the priest when the high
[1:29:18] priest took the plate
[1:29:20] and used his finger
[1:29:23] and sprinkle it ever here the drop
[1:29:28] that was coming from the finger of the
[1:29:31] high priest was the blood for that age
[1:29:47] brother brother says this
[1:29:49] i read this and i never understood it
[1:29:51] until last night
[1:29:52] he said seven lamps you know what they
[1:29:55] are
[1:29:56] all lamps are seven water
[1:29:59] cost seven water
[1:30:01] meaning seven manifestation
[1:30:04] of the holy ghost of the seven
[1:30:07] and the seven water
[1:30:10] feet of water
[1:30:11] for the water
[1:30:12] [Music]
[1:30:17] everybody okay so here they are seven
[1:30:20] seats of water
[1:30:22] so the church ages are the mercy seat of
[1:30:25] god
[1:30:28] everybody okay
[1:30:29] everybody okay but in the church ages
[1:30:32] you must have blood
[1:30:36] everybody okay and the blood must come
[1:30:39] from the high priest
[1:30:41] and our high priest is jesus christ
[1:30:44] after the order of melchizedek
[1:30:49] everybody here but he's not using the
[1:30:51] blood of bulls and god he's using his
[1:30:55] own blood and he's sprinkling every
[1:30:58] church edges how many times
[1:31:02] with water
[1:31:04] what is the finger of god
[1:31:09] glory to god
[1:31:11] you okay
[1:31:13] in luke chapter 11. 11
[1:31:16] everybody okay
[1:31:17] watch the word in purple or lavender
[1:31:21] but if i with the water
[1:31:24] cast that devil know that the kingdom of
[1:31:27] god is come
[1:31:28] upon
[1:31:30] matthew 12 28 but if i
[1:31:34] something cast out the devil by the
[1:31:37] water
[1:31:39] then the kingdom of god is come upon
[1:31:42] so the finger of god is water
[1:31:46] so when he uses his finger seven times
[1:31:49] he's using the seven spirit upon the
[1:31:52] seven church edges to bring the word of
[1:31:55] the hour
[1:32:00] everybody okay
[1:32:01] that's why brother branham said in the
[1:32:04] rapture
[1:32:05] when we are parading
[1:32:07] going toward the heaven
[1:32:09] some of this day in the rupture time
[1:32:12] that lays ahead proudly displaying water
[1:32:17] upon the water which is water
[1:32:21] in the hour they are water
[1:32:24] so the message of the hour is the blood
[1:32:28] of god upon the mercy seat
[1:32:32] when you move from the message you're
[1:32:34] moving from the blood
[1:32:39] without this message there is no blood
[1:32:43] god have only seven jobs
[1:32:46] one for paul
[1:32:48] one for arenas one for luther one for
[1:32:52] wesley and one for william marion

[1:54:17] spirit
[1:54:19] but here then he arrives to the seven
[1:54:22] church ages
[1:54:24] everybody here that's why when john fell
[1:54:27] at the feet of jesus christ
[1:54:31] to resurrect the
[1:54:34] bride god needed his right hand
[1:54:39] which have certain style

[1:54:58] amen
[1:54:59] another word without disturbs
[1:55:03] there is no grace
[1:55:09] when you pull from the message you are
[1:55:12] pulling from grace
[1:55:13] you are pulling from peace
[1:55:20] this message is the blood
[1:55:22] this message is the peace of god this
[1:55:26] message is the grace of god that's why
[1:55:29] brother branham preached shalom
[1:55:31] [Applause]
[1:55:37] the message is crushed
[1:55:39] it's your peace
[1:55:41] it's your job it is it is
[1:55:44] it is your grace
[1:55:49] it is your blood
[1:55:51] [Music]
[1:55:51] [Applause]
[1:55:56] [Music]
[1:56:01] listen to this
[1:56:04] the message
[1:56:05] is addressed to the leaders of the
[1:56:10] god
[1:56:11] help that guy that shall pull away from

[1:56:28] everybody here
[1:56:30] god help that guy that shall pull away
[1:56:34] from water
[1:56:35] why because when they pull away from the
[1:56:38] message they are moving outside of the
[1:56:41] blood they are moving outside of the
[1:56:43] grace they are moving outside of the
[1:56:46] peace
[1:56:49] there is no peace without this message
[1:56:52] there is no grace without this message
[1:56:55] there is no blood without this message
[1:57:00] [Music]
[1:57:05] but it was given to the angel and the
[1:57:09] angel was in his
[1:57:11] under his own

[1:57:17] from his water
[1:57:19] they are in his right hand that is they
[1:57:22] are in
[1:57:28] while they are on the earth
[1:57:31] that's why you heard paul
[1:57:33] who came after peter
[1:57:36] after by telling me after john but paul
[1:57:40] have the audacity to say if somebody
[1:57:43] preach another gospel
[1:57:46] different than what me paul
[1:57:55] because paul was in the right hand
[1:58:02] peter was not in the right hand but tell
[1:58:05] him he was not in the right hand those
[1:58:07] that are in the right hand they have
[1:58:10] supreme power
[1:58:12] if somebody preaches another gospel
[1:58:15] matter fact even if an angel comes from
[1:58:18] heaven called avenger curse
[1:58:24] [Applause]
[1:58:29] do you know that power rebuke peter
[1:58:32] what does he have power to rebuke peter
[1:58:36] everybody
[1:58:38] and when peter begin to write he say our
[1:58:41] brother paul
[1:58:42] are preaching things that are difficult
[1:58:45] to understand
[1:58:46] but who started with jesus christ
[1:58:49] why is peter recognizing paul
[1:58:53] why you have a hard time recognizing
[1:58:55] william mayan branham
[1:59:00] ff boxwood
[1:59:02] who was before him recognized him
[1:59:06] delos born recognized him because he was
[1:59:10] in the right hand of god

[1:59:44] unto the angel of the
[1:59:47] address to the star
[1:59:49] of the age that is what

[1:59:56] if he doesn't preach the water
[1:59:59] and that angel will ensure in water
[2:00:02] that's why they told brother branham
[2:00:05] when jesus come he will judge you first
[2:00:09] and if you are accepted
[2:00:12] spoken when tabernacle is also accepted
[2:00:16] [Music]

[2:46:09] with the word that was written
[2:46:12] but not the word that was sealed
[2:46:14] everybody here
[2:46:16] if you notice
[2:46:18] we talked about this
[2:46:20] we talked about this we talked about
[2:46:22] this but if you look
[2:46:25] after we talk when we talk about the
[2:46:27] road of aaron if you look down there is
[2:46:30] a ball

[2:46:49] let me continue
[2:46:51] okay brother branham said this now
[2:46:53] examine this lamb you will notice that
[2:46:56] it has a large bowl
[2:46:58] a reservoir
[2:47:00] that is essential to the seven arms that
[2:47:04] come out this oil
[2:47:06] is filled with water
[2:47:08] which flows through there
[2:47:11] which are placed in the seven arm
[2:47:14] it is the same all that burn and make
[2:47:17] the light at the end of the seven
[2:47:20] those right there hey but here this
[2:47:23] light never went out the water
[2:47:26] just keep water
[2:47:29] who was pouring oil
[2:47:32] not the prophet
[2:47:34] the priest
[2:47:35] son of god
[2:47:38] son of god
[2:47:40] son of god
[2:47:41] not son of man
[2:47:42] it is the son of god oil
[2:47:46] we okay did i lose you
[2:47:48] did i lose you
[2:47:50] my goodness
[2:47:53] can i continue
[2:47:55] brother branham say how thrilling it is
[2:47:57] to think of those seven lamps drawing
[2:47:59] water
[2:48:05] because there
[2:48:07] they had their week deeper in each
[2:48:10] church age messenger is depicted
[2:48:13] his life is on
[2:48:15] with the holy ghost he is
[2:48:18] life has been immersed in
[2:48:21] true
[2:48:22] so the ball is who
[2:48:25] okay
[2:48:26] true
[2:48:31] i have
[2:48:32] the bullet i have that i receive on on
[2:48:34] wednesday i don't even have time to drop
[2:48:36] it
[2:48:37] [Music]
[2:48:38] through the week through that week he's
[2:48:41] joining the very life of christ and by
[2:48:43] it it's giving love to them
[2:48:46] what kind of light is he giving the very
[2:48:49] same light that was on the first
[2:48:51] that was what yes
[2:48:53] now let me skip this not only can we
[2:48:56] speak that's no
[2:48:58] and right on down the chair the edges to
[2:49:01] the present time of the last day
[2:49:03] messenger the same life and the same
[2:49:06] light is manifested by a life that is
[2:49:09] hit with crossing
[2:49:10] in other words one big bowl
[2:49:13] paul pulled oil from them
[2:49:15] and gave it to the church and the church
[2:49:17] took that oil
[2:49:18] a when you spool oil columba pull oil
[2:49:22] molten pool or
[2:49:24] looter pool oil seymour came and pulled
[2:49:27] all
[2:49:29] right
[2:49:30] everybody okay
[2:49:32] thank you brother bottom said not only
[2:49:34] can we speak that's of the messenger but
[2:49:37] every true what
[2:49:39] is dramatically depicted
[2:49:41] the candlestick represented the
[2:49:43] messenger but he also represents the
[2:49:45] believer you need to reach that level
[2:49:47] they are all drawing from the same
[2:49:49] they all have been deep into the same
[2:49:52] they are dead to themselves and their
[2:49:54] life is healed in crossing who
[2:49:56] they are sealed by their water
[2:49:58] praise god you ready now
[2:50:03] if you look at this light
[2:50:06] this light also has a bowl
[2:50:12] okay
[2:50:12] and at the end he have what
[2:50:15] this light have a ball
[2:50:18] and at the end he has what
[2:50:20] so this light is the same as that one
[2:50:29] anybody okay
[2:50:31] everybody okay
[2:50:32] everybody okay
[2:50:33] and who was pouring this oil
[2:50:37] god as the son of god
[2:50:40] was giving the oil through the church
[2:50:42] ages because he's the priest
[2:50:44] and the melchizedek ever here because
[2:50:47] he's dealing with the open evidence
[2:50:52] he's a priest
[2:50:53] but at the seven church ages
[2:50:56] the light began to go out
[2:50:59] god found out that there is another
[2:51:01] evidence that is sealed
[2:51:06] but the oil of the ball
[2:51:08] cannot be enough
[2:51:10] to meet the bridegroom
[2:51:12] they all love the candlestick
[2:51:15] cannot be enough to meet the candlestick
[2:51:18] because the candlestick can go out
[2:51:23] you remember the time of samuel
[2:51:25] the lamp of the lord went out
[2:51:28] [Music]
[2:51:29] but here
[2:51:30] you need now a different oil
[2:51:34] not the oil of a bowl
[2:51:36] that is already burning but the oil of a
[2:51:39] bowl that has not burned
[2:51:43] [Music]
[2:51:44] yet an anointing that has not been
[2:51:48] displayed yet
[2:51:54] that anointing even paul never
[2:51:58] experienced that
[2:52:01] even our news never experienced that
[2:52:04] even brother branham before 63 he never
[2:52:08] experienced that
[2:52:13] [Music]
[2:52:17] he tested that a little bit by creating
[2:52:20] the square
[2:52:21] that was just a test
[2:52:25] are we okay
[2:52:26] did i lose you
[2:52:28] glory to god
[2:52:30] so we need the second oil
[2:52:32] because we found out that the oil of the
[2:52:35] ball
[2:52:36] through what the wedding of time is
[2:52:38] gonna go out
[2:52:40] that's why pentecostal can make it
[2:52:43] they started good
[2:52:45] but today they drifted away because they
[2:52:48] were using the oil from the ball
[2:52:51] that's why luther became a denomination
[2:52:54] because he was using the oil from the
[2:52:56] ball he worked at the beginning and
[2:52:58] after a while
[2:53:01] bernicos worked at the beginning after a
[2:53:03] while
[2:53:05] [Music]
[2:53:08] it is the holy ghost
[2:53:10] but it is to a measure
[2:53:13] as soon as he plateau the pentecostal
[2:53:16] begin to wear paint
[2:53:18] they begin to preach on the gospel they
[2:53:20] begin to wear tight they begin to go any
[2:53:23] kind of way because their oil comes from
[2:53:25] the ball that's why they're all the
[2:53:27] virgins slumbered and sleep but when
[2:53:30] they walk
[2:53:32] there is another oil
[2:53:35] everybody okay
[2:53:37] i'm searching the airport my friend we
[2:53:39] went too high so give me time as i'm
[2:53:41] dropping the ship
[2:53:43] everybody okay
[2:53:44] everybody okay
[2:53:46] my goodness
[2:53:47] where am i at
[2:53:49] you okay
[2:53:50] i'm gonna stop sooner
[2:53:52] the bible brother brother say
[2:53:54] that great spirit we would call it the
[2:53:57] colors of the word
[2:53:59] the best way i will illustrated one was
[2:54:03] the spirit of love the other one the
[2:54:05] spirit of what
[2:54:06] and so forth the seven spirit of god
[2:54:08] that make up
[2:54:10] praise god
[2:54:11] let me continue brother brother say the
[2:54:14] seven rainbows color that means seven
[2:54:17] bowls how
[2:54:18] many seven boys seven what
[2:54:23] reflecting water
[2:54:25] each light to wrap up into
[2:54:27] hallelujah he named the light
[2:54:30] he say orange red orange yellow green
[2:54:32] blue violet don't you see god in his
[2:54:35] seventh color rainbow his covenant that
[2:54:38] he made a covenant that through the
[2:54:40] seven church edges the seventh color he
[2:54:43] would save there
[2:54:45] but if you notice all of them are a bow
[2:54:48] it's a bow
[2:54:49] it's a bow anybody clear
[2:54:52] we're here
[2:54:53] you okay
[2:54:54] but
[2:54:55] they both started noah god told noah
[2:54:58] that i will set my ball in the cloud
[2:55:01] there is a token that i will not destroy
[2:55:04] the earth
[2:55:05] brother branham say this rainbow only
[2:55:08] was
[2:55:09] horizontally just cover
[2:55:12] one half of the earth
[2:55:16] that is all known as when broke over
[2:55:19] he was in a
[2:55:21] arch that is all you can see but when
[2:55:25] john saw him
[2:55:26] in his emirate color
[2:55:29] he did water
[2:55:30] [Music]
[2:55:33] so
[2:55:34] there is a ball that looked like this
[2:55:38] and a boat that looked like half
[2:55:41] because half of this boy is missing
[2:55:47] in other words the circle of the bow
[2:55:51] have two parts
[2:55:53] he have the part that was open
[2:55:56] to noah
[2:55:57] and he was another part that never was
[2:56:00] exposed to noah he was broke only john
[2:56:03] saw the missing party
[2:56:06] [Applause]
[2:56:10] [Music]
[2:56:12] don't worry my friend i'm gonna drop
[2:56:15] amen
[2:56:16] so if you take the rainbow
[2:56:19] you're gonna see that the candlestick
[2:56:22] unlike a rainbow flip up
[2:56:32] everybody okay
[2:56:33] if you look at the rain bro you will see
[2:56:36] that the candlestick followed and ran
[2:56:38] bro that is looking up
[2:56:41] but it's missing a part
[2:56:45] and this candlestick are we using a ball
[2:56:50] for oil
[2:56:52] anybody here but there is a missing
[2:56:55] rainbow here
[2:56:57] but to get the missing hidden handball
[2:57:00] you need the second oil
[2:57:02] [Music]
[2:57:08] [Music]
[2:57:15] you see now
[2:57:17] here was the candlestick two three four
[2:57:19] five six seven like this this golden
[2:57:21] what
[2:57:22] so when you look at them the candy stick
[2:57:24] run in a notch so there is one person
[2:57:28] missing
[2:57:32] prepare because i seen the airport i'm
[2:57:34] gonna drop sooner ever here
[2:57:37] in first corinthians chapter 13 the
[2:57:40] bible said we know in
[2:57:44] who said that
[2:57:46] in the seven
[2:57:48] churches we okay
[2:57:51] and we prophesy
[2:57:55] because we're using the ball
[2:57:58] we don't use the reserve or eliot
[2:58:01] that is for the end time for midnight
[2:58:04] when the bridegroom is coming
[2:58:08] [Music]
[2:58:10] everybody here
[2:58:11] but when that which is
[2:58:14] [Music]
[2:58:18] the second oil is water
[2:58:23] the second oil is the oil of water
[2:58:26] is just imperfect
[2:58:30] ever here when that which is prophet
[2:58:33] come that which is part shall be water
[2:58:39] hallelujah
[2:58:41] if you look on your window you're gonna
[2:58:42] see the city
[2:58:46] are you ready are you ready
[2:58:49] paul say for i am
[2:58:52] jealous offer you with water
[2:58:56] for i have married you
[2:58:59] [Music]
[2:59:02] i have water
[2:59:04] which means water
[2:59:06] that's why the virgin were only going
[2:59:09] engaged but they were not
[2:59:12] because paul didn't have the right to
[2:59:15] marry them
[2:59:16] [Music]
[2:59:20] everybody okay
[2:59:21] so throughout the seven churches because
[2:59:25] they use the all from the ball the blood
[2:59:28] of jesus christ was only espoused
[2:59:31] only engaged
[2:59:33] but not married yet
[2:59:38] to be married you need the second one
[2:59:43] [Music]
[2:59:46] hallelujah
[2:59:48] we okay
[2:59:49] we okay
[2:59:51] robert i gotta stop
[2:59:53] watch this
[2:59:55] paul
[2:59:56] because he has passed the bread
[2:59:58] what is he saying he says for i have
[3:00:01] inspired you to water
[3:00:04] not one man
[3:00:07] ever here
[3:00:08] it's a husband but you're not united
[3:00:11] with him yet
[3:00:12] because we are using the boil oil
[3:00:15] so you need to keep moving
[3:00:17] until the retail time where the second
[3:00:19] oil will be activated
[3:00:22] that i may present you as a
[3:00:25] chest water
[3:00:27] a married woman is not a virgin
[3:00:30] so the bride is not married yet
[3:00:33] america the bride through newton

[3:06:07] with the second oil
[3:06:08] [Music]
[3:06:10] everybody okay
[3:06:11] everybody okay that's why in revelation
[3:06:14] 10 when he's coming down
[3:06:16] he look at the devil at the sea on the
[3:06:19] beyond the earth
[3:06:21] he put his foot there and he put another
[3:06:24] foot there
[3:06:25] saying that now i have come
[3:06:29] saying therefore i have come
[3:06:32] this word will not fail
[3:06:35] [Applause]
[3:06:38] this church will not
[3:06:40] fail because it's not the sake it's not
[3:06:44] the first door it is the second oil the
[3:06:47] second one
[3:06:50] [Music]
[3:06:53] [Applause]
[3:06:55] [Music]
[3:07:00] [Applause]
[3:07:01] the second oil
[3:07:03] have the devil

[3:07:18] but on the second fist
[3:07:20] on the second feet
[3:07:22] hey buddy
[3:07:23] that's why in revelation 10 when he
[3:07:26] comes
[3:07:27] automatically he's not playing games
[3:07:29] with the devil
[3:07:30] he's blocking the two feasts
[3:07:33] because now i have come down
[3:07:35] paul
[3:07:36] what you were afraid of i'm gonna deal
[3:07:38] with it now
[3:07:42] [Music]
[3:07:47] buddy
[3:07:48] i apologize
[3:07:49] i gotta stop here
[3:07:52] i'm not preaching on wednesday i'm not
[3:07:54] preaching on sunday so you take your
[3:07:56] time and meditate through this because
[3:07:59] this is loaded
[3:08:01] meditate meditate because when i'm
[3:08:03] coming back i'm gonna take you again
[3:08:05] and we're gonna go higher
[3:08:07] anybody here let's pray heavenly father
[3:08:10] lord we are approaching you again humbly
[3:08:13] father thanking you
[3:08:14] for the second oil
[3:08:16] thanking you for this holy ghost
[3:08:20] no wonder
[3:08:21] your prophet said
[3:08:23] that the token
[3:08:25] cannot come
[3:08:27] until the evening light
[3:08:29] and the people didn't understand his
[3:08:31] language but he was talking about the
[3:08:33] second oil
[3:08:35] it is a different token
[3:08:38] because if he was the same token
[3:08:41] we could be denomination by this time
[3:08:43] and brother branham say watch every
[3:08:45] revival
[3:08:46] every three years
[3:08:48] they become a denomination but this one
[3:08:51] since inside
[3:08:53] there is no denomination
[3:08:54] because it's not the first oil
[3:08:57] it is the second oil
[3:08:59] further may your children cherish this
[3:09:02] message
[3:09:03] may they understand that this message is
[3:09:06] not a game
[3:09:07] it is not a message that is stand
[3:09:10] to play a game with the devil
[3:09:13] it is not an anointing that is coming to
[3:09:16] make another church
[3:09:18] to make another move
[3:09:20] to make another click
[3:09:22] that's why all the clicks
[3:09:24] and the moves that rise in this message
[3:09:27] are falling down
[3:09:28] because they missed the purpose
[3:09:31] that the message was not sent for
[3:09:33] removal
[3:09:35] he was sent to collect the pure bread of
[3:09:38] jesus christ
[3:09:40] and this eve is not going to fail
[3:09:43] father bless your children as they went
[3:09:46] an extra mile to let me reach this point
