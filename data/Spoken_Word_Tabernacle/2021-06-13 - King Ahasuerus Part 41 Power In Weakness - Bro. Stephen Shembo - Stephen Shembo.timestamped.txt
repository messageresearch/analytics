[19:40] well you give it you start then
[19:45] he might take a little bit but uh
[19:48] wednesday night we were here we listened
[19:49] to brother polly carp
[19:50] and the message that he brought i went
[19:53] home and i listened to
[19:54] the message that brother donnie reagan
[19:56] was preaching
[19:58] simultaneously the time that brother
[20:00] polycarp was preaching
[20:02] it's almost identical the message was
[20:04] almost god
[20:06] is with us saints god knows where we're
[20:08] at he knows where we're living
[20:10] and when he said wake up if you're
[20:12] slumbering it's time to wake up
[20:18] hallelujah
[20:24] good morning ladies and gentlemen um
[20:28] my testimony can get kind of lengthy but
[20:30] i'm going to give you kind of the
[20:32] nuts and bolts of it um i was at a very
[20:36] very bad place in my life this was
[20:40] about a year and a half ago
[20:43] i was living in gaffney i was living in
[20:45] the streets i was living in a tent
[20:48] in a walmart parking lot in gaffney if
[20:51] you guys know the boulevard down there
[20:53] um
[20:54] my journey that got me there was all out
[20:57] of pride
[20:58] as we all know which is probably the
[21:01] number one sin in the bible
[21:03] ask the devil um
[21:06] and it resulted in a secondary conflict
[21:09] in my life which was
[21:10] alcohol both of those together tormented
[21:15] my life for
[21:16] multiple years which resulted in
[21:19] my affliction carrying me to the gaffin
[21:21] area i'm originally from orlando florida
[21:26] but just long story short i was at the
[21:29] end of my rope
[21:30] i was teeter knocking on death's door so
[21:32] to speak
[21:33] um i had had numerous encounters with
[21:36] seizures related to alcohol getting on
[21:38] and off of it in and out of the hospital
[21:42] and i used to visit the walmart frequent
[21:44] not the walmart but the
[21:45] mcdonald's up there and that's how i got
[21:47] my free tv
[21:48] i would get my news my sports whatever
[21:51] since i was living in a tent
[21:53] but the odds of this gentleman coming
[21:55] into my life
[21:57] we're slim to none and he saw me in my
[22:00] most devastating state
[22:02] in walmart the actions that i had and
[22:05] just through his
[22:05] observances of me saw that there was
[22:09] hope
[22:09] and almost as if jesus was walking the
[22:12] way that he did
[22:14] seeing individuals in this world and
[22:17] seeing the best of them
[22:18] instead of the worse i'm a very
[22:21] judgmental person myself
[22:23] i do it on a daily basis and i frown
[22:26] upon myself for that
[22:27] seeing always the worst in a person
[22:29] instead of their best and this gentleman
[22:30] saw the best in me in my worst state
[22:32] ever
[22:33] which was amazing and he had the ability
[22:37] i at that point in my life was shielded
[22:40] off they always say
[22:42] coach yourself with the armor of god i
[22:44] had the armor of satan on and i was
[22:46] blocking the holy spirit from getting
[22:48] into my life
[22:49] at that point in time and talking to me
[22:52] blasphemy of the holy spirit that's
[22:55] unforgivable
[22:55] and i was doing that at the time so if i
[22:57] was going to call if that was my last
[23:01] purpose on this earth i would not be in
[23:03] a better place
[23:05] but thankful to my lord and savior and
[23:07] this gentleman right here which he used
[23:09] as an earthly tool
[23:11] to grab me by the hand pull me up by the
[23:15] coach strings and have all the patience
[23:17] and perseverance
[23:18] to guide me in the right direction i am
[23:21] in such a better place right now and i
[23:23] know it all
[23:23] it's all for my lord and savior but this
[23:26] gentleman was an
[23:26] excellent tool and i refer to him not as
[23:29] my mentor
[23:30] but as my earthly angel and i praise
[23:33] this man i don't give him enough praise
[23:36] but this is my next step in my life to
[23:38] continue the communication with this
[23:39] gentleman
[23:40] and without him i wouldn't be right here
[23:42] to be able to give my testimony with you
[23:44] guys so
[23:45] thank all of you guys for your prayers
[23:47] and everything thank you so much
[23:50] god is good all the time hallelujah
[23:55] glory
[23:59] now was that goosebumps i was seeing on
[24:01] your arms there brother
[24:02] i could tell you it was all over him

[24:08] that's okay

[25:01] a lady
[25:02] down there that she has been witnessing
[25:05] to
[25:06] and the lady now listens to brother

[32:44] god bless everyone thank god for the
[32:48] opportunity and the privilege to be here
[32:49] today
[32:51] and this song came in my heart last week
[32:53] and
[32:54] came back again this morning as um
[32:58] my wife and i were talking about
[32:59] something and she was talking about
[33:02] you know faith people saying well i have
[33:05] faith that you know god will work
[33:07] but we were seeing that if we're not in
[33:11] order
[33:12] god will not work because he wants
[33:14] preeminence
[33:16] and you could have a
[33:19] a bunch of perfectly formed
[33:22] body parts if they're not all connected
[33:25] the spirit can't do anything so this is
[33:27] what the song is about
[33:29] pray it blesses your heart
[33:32] i'm very nervous but i pray the lord
[33:34] will help us amen i think
[33:38] it it also came from something brother
[33:40] stephen had said
[33:42] about what the lord is doing among us
[33:45] that the word
[33:45] seems to be so you know shaking
[33:48] everybody and
[33:50] people thinking well the word is against
[33:53] me not against you is shaking you to put
[33:55] you in a place where you need to be
[33:57] and as long as we can catch that catch
[34:00] that thought
[34:01] then we could agree with the word and
[34:03] get in place
[34:04] quickly because he wants preeminence in
[34:06] the body
[34:08] amen it's it's based on hagia chapter 2
[34:12] and verse 6.
[34:14] and the key the key is e if you have
[34:17] that please
[34:20] for thus said the lord of hosts yet
[34:24] once it is a little while and i will
[34:27] shake the heavens
[34:29] and the earth and the sea and the dry
[34:32] land
[34:33] and i will shake all nations and the
[34:36] desire of all nations shall come
[34:39] and i will fill this house with glory
[34:42] sear the lord of hosts
[34:46] yet once more lord
[34:52] shake not just heaven but earth
[34:57] and many stars
[35:00] of being moved out of place
[35:07] but there are some who stood
[35:11] platies and orion
[35:17] in every age
[35:21] who kept their first estate
[35:25] [Music]
[35:27] and though the powers
[35:31] of heaven are shaken
[35:36] we've received the kingdom
[35:40] that cannot be moved
[35:45] all that can be shaken
[35:50] will be shaken
[35:53] [Music]
[35:55] let thy word lord
[35:59] shake us into place
[36:02] [Music]
[36:07] the heavens declare
[36:10] the glory of god
[36:17] and day on today
[36:21] utter at speech
[36:27] a night on tonight
[36:30] it showed knowledge
[36:36] for the in god's perfect peace
[36:46] but tell me what will happen
[36:49] if the moon should leave her place
[36:55] then the face of the earth would be
[36:59] a dark and chaos again
[37:04] so what about the earthly hosts
[37:08] who were made in the image of god
[37:14] if we are not in order
[37:17] how can we do the work of god
[37:24] yet once more lord
[37:29] shake not just heaven but earth
[37:33] and many stars
[37:37] are being moved out of place
[37:43] but we are those who stayed
[37:46] with pleiades and orion
[37:50] [Music]
[37:52] in every age
[37:56] we've kept our first estate
[38:05] the world is again
[38:08] falling apart
[38:13] and soon the millennium
[38:16] will be our shirt in
[38:22] but first this kingdom
[38:26] will be in you spiritually
[38:32] before it comes in the earth
[38:36] literally
[38:41] for in the days of the
[38:45] came tantos rock cut without
[38:49] hands
[38:51] to smite every image in our earth
[38:55] made by man
[38:59] and knowing not the kingdom
[39:03] of the lord is in you
[39:08] for the stone did not only smite
[39:12] but grew into a mountain too
[39:17] [Music]
[39:18] yet once more lord
[39:23] shake not just heaven but earth
[39:28] and many stars are being moved out of
[39:35] place
[39:37] but we are those who stayed
[39:40] the orion
[39:46] in every age
[39:50] we've kept our first estate
[39:56] and though the powers
[40:00] of heaven are shaken
[40:04] we've received the kingdom
[40:09] that cannot be moved
[40:13] or that can be shaken
[40:18] will be shaken
[40:21] [Music]
[40:23] let thy word lord
[40:27] shake us into place
[40:35] we were like dry bones down
[40:38] in the valley
[40:44] then the son of man came
[40:47] with a prophecy
[40:53] out of his mouth came seven
[40:57] thundering voices
[41:02] to quicken and bring to life
[41:06] this scattered body
[41:11] then came a noise and the shaking
[41:15] as each bone came to its bone
[41:20] sinew and flesh skin came
[41:23] upon it but it had no life
[41:26] of its own
[41:30] but then he prophesied again
[41:33] the dynamics came into that body
[41:39] and so today we can stand on the earth
[41:43] a mighty marching army
[41:49] so yet once more lord
[41:52] o sheikh not just
[41:55] heaven but earth
[41:58] and many stars
[42:01] are being moved out of place
[42:07] but we are those who stayed
[42:11] the pleiades and orion
[42:16] in this last age
[42:20] we've kept our first estate
[42:24] [Music]
[42:26] and though the powers
[42:29] of heaven are shaken
[42:34] we've received a kingdom
[42:38] that cannot be moved
[42:43] all that can be shaken
[42:47] will be shaken
[42:52] but let thy word lord
[42:56] shake us into place
[43:02] let thy word lord
[43:06] shake us into place

[51:28] gratuitous
[51:29] and everything that he did for you amen
[51:32] if it's not possible

[51:37] on the window
[51:40] okay blessed be the name of the lord

[51:52] heel
[51:55] have not even touched it yet
[51:59] what is steven is it two millimeter two
[52:00] centimeter three millimeter
[52:03] till i preach on that first and then we
[52:06] see if you're going to ask that question
[52:09] amen yeah once we get prepared through
[52:12] this we finish then we
[52:14] open the high heel and then i let that
[52:16] quest i'll let you answer that question
[52:18] when you see what high heel does amen
[52:22] in the scripture and in the message

[52:27] we get in the message
[52:29] amen yeah i have a little chart for you

[52:35] message we don't wear high heels no you

[52:39] where is he written in the scripture and
[52:41] where is it in the message of the hour
[52:43] amen
[52:44] isaiah chapter 14
[52:48] blessed be the name of the lord
[52:52] you remember last sunday right you know
[52:55] where we stopped right
[52:57] yeah god wanted to express himself
[53:00] in attribute and to do that
[53:03] he needed a woman
[53:07] so the conception of the brothers in the
[53:09] message toward women need to be
[53:16] we need to remove that old computer that
[53:19] look at sister like sex
[53:21] slaves
[53:26] anyway i'm talking to this church
[53:32] women must be respected
[53:35] amen why didn't god create himself and
[53:38] come into the world in a man jesus
[53:40] christ
[53:41] you have to borrow a woman
[53:44] isaiah 14 verse 12
[53:48] the sister dead the sister there
[53:53] and you can't live without her
[53:58] i'm glad the sister says amen
[54:00] [Laughter]
[54:03] verse 12 how are you falling from heaven
[54:07] oh lucifer when my brother mentioned
[54:09] here pride i was like okay i got the
[54:12] signal
[54:14] how are you falling from heaven oh
[54:16] lucifer
[54:17] son of the morning you might be seated
[54:20] how are you cut down
[54:22] to the ground which did weaken
[54:25] the nations this is isaiah
[54:29] explaining lucifer for you have said in
[54:33] your heart
[54:34] that's where the problem started in the
[54:36] heart
[54:37] malachi 4 in the heart returned our
[54:40] heart
[54:42] for you have said in your heart this is
[54:45] where sin started
[54:47] that's why jesus said it's not what
[54:48] enter in the men's heart
[54:50] but it's what is coming out of the heart
[54:52] amen
[54:54] for you have said in your heart
[54:57] no wonder he was in eden
[55:00] you remember that out of court eden
[55:04] and then the garden of eden and he was
[55:06] in the garden of eden
[55:08] you have said in your heart i will
[55:12] ascend
[55:12] into heaven i will exalt my throne
[55:16] above the stars of god how many knows
[55:19] who are the stars of god
[55:21] the stars of god are the children of god
[55:24] amen
[55:25] but lucifer wanted to exalt himself
[55:27] above
[55:28] the stars of god because a star of god
[55:32] is just like god amen
[55:35] that's why satan told jesus if you be
[55:38] the son of god
[55:39] turn this stone into bread he knew that
[55:43] the son of god
[55:44] is exactly a god that's why he want to
[55:47] rise not only above god but
[55:49] even the star of god because we sit
[55:52] on the throne with him we are the wife
[55:55] of christ
[55:56] we and god are make sense
[56:00] okay so when the devil needs you he's
[56:02] attacking god
[56:03] amen so above the stars of god
[56:06] i will sit also upon the mount of the
[56:09] congregation which congregation
[56:12] before the foundation of the world amen
[56:14] in the sides of the north you remember
[56:17] psalm 78 jerusalem was in the north
[56:20] amen and he want to build his city on
[56:22] the north
[56:24] verse 14 i will ascend above the heights
[56:28] of the cloud i will be
[56:31] like the monster so somebody
[56:34] wanted to be like god amen
[56:38] wanted to be king remember that
[56:41] amen want to be king a hazardous let's
[56:44] go to ezekiel chapter 28
[56:47] the heart of lucifer wanted to exalt
[56:50] himself
[56:51] a pride sin began with pride
[56:57] sin originated in heaven
[57:00] and it started with a proud spirit
[57:03] that's why proud spirit is a very wicked
[57:06] thing
[57:07] you are nobody you are nothing
[57:12] you are just saved by god's grace
[57:15] period you are nothing
[57:18] if the life is taken out of you we're
[57:20] going to go ahead and bury you
[57:23] and it's going to be the skin worm and
[57:25] everybody destroying your body
[57:27] so we are nothing the only one that must
[57:30] take preeminence is the lord jesus
[57:32] christ
[57:33] [Applause]
[57:34] amen ezekiel chapter 28
[57:37] verse 1 if you there you can say amen
[57:41] the word of the lord came again to me
[57:43] saying
[57:44] son of man say to who
[57:48] this man is called the prince do you
[57:51] know that jesus also is a prisoner
[57:54] okay let's see who this man is
[57:58] speak to the prince of terrorists that
[58:01] says the lord god
[58:03] because your heart isaiah just told us
[58:07] somebody in heaven
[58:09] who has a heart lifter amen
[58:12] now he said because your heart is lift
[58:14] up
[58:15] spirit of pride and you have said i am
[58:21] so if you notice this is not a king
[58:24] really
[58:26] this is someone it is not really a man
[58:30] there is somebody there amen this person
[58:33] want to be god
[58:34] and he says that he is already god
[58:37] amen i am a god i
[58:40] sit in the seat of who do you see how he
[58:44] exalted himself
[58:46] in the seat of god make sure you watch
[58:48] his you you watch your bible
[58:50] in the midst of the seas yet
[58:53] you are a man so this man
[58:57] received an anointing and that anointing
[59:01] make him feel and take the place of god
[59:07] but we know that in heaven the one who
[59:10] wanted to be god was lucifer
[59:13] so this man was incarnated by satan
[59:19] anybody kill you now amen
[59:23] in the midst of the sea yet you are a
[59:25] man and not god
[59:27] though you set your heart as the heart
[59:30] of water
[59:31] you see amen behold
[59:34] you are wiser than daniel there is no
[59:38] secret
[59:38] that can hide from you if you read like
[59:41] this you're not going to understand this
[59:43] this is irony
[59:45] the prophet is speaking and he's talking
[59:48] to this man
[59:50] the true translation says do you
[59:54] think you are like daniel
[59:57] because daniel had a wisdom that came
[1:00:01] from god
[1:00:02] and daniel taught the king that nobody
[1:00:05] can interpret the dream
[1:00:07] the only one that interprets the dream
[1:00:09] is god
[1:00:10] so the prophet is talking to this man in
[1:00:13] irony
[1:00:14] telling him that you're just a man but
[1:00:16] you want to make yourself like god
[1:00:19] are you wiser than daniel
[1:00:22] amen make sense are you wiser than
[1:00:26] daniel
[1:00:27] there is no secret that can hide from
[1:00:29] you because there was no secret
[1:00:31] that could be hidden to daniel no matter
[1:00:34] what dream you brought to dania he will
[1:00:36] give you the interpretation
[1:00:38] so they compare him like daniel they say
[1:00:40] do you think you were at the level of
[1:00:42] daniel
[1:00:43] do you think you are as high as daniel
[1:00:45] do you think like
[1:00:46] nothing no mystery is hidden from you
[1:00:49] if no mystery was hidden from you how
[1:00:52] you didn't detect
[1:00:53] moses in pharaoh's house when he was
[1:00:56] growing up
[1:00:58] why you didn't kill moses amen moses was
[1:01:02] right there with pharaoh
[1:01:03] and you fear you fed moses and make him
[1:01:07] grow
[1:01:08] until he comes and destroy you if you
[1:01:11] think
[1:01:11] nothing was hidden for you why you
[1:01:13] didn't detect
[1:01:14] moses why you didn't detect jesus christ
[1:01:18] why you didn't chase him to egypt
[1:01:21] because the seventh seal was
[1:01:23] locked amen
[1:01:26] verse four with your water
[1:01:29] wisdom and your remember the two trees
[1:01:32] in the garden of eden the two women and
[1:01:35] the two wisdom
[1:01:36] with your wisdom and your understanding
[1:01:38] you have gotten your riches
[1:01:41] and have gotten gold and silver
[1:01:44] into your treasures by
[1:01:47] your great wisdom there is a great
[1:01:49] wisdom here
[1:01:51] and by your traffic you have increased
[1:01:53] your riches
[1:01:54] and your heart is lift up because of
[1:01:58] your riches
[1:01:59] therefore that says the lord god because
[1:02:02] you have set your heart as the heart of
[1:02:05] god
[1:02:06] you see that behold therefore
[1:02:09] i will bring strangers upon you the
[1:02:12] terrible of the nation
[1:02:14] and they shall draw the sword against
[1:02:17] the beauty of your water so
[1:02:21] what made this man think like he is god
[1:02:25] what took this man and and
[1:02:28] and and bring him to this state that he
[1:02:31] elevated himself
[1:02:32] is his wisdom he brought
[1:02:36] so much about the wisdom the beauty
[1:02:39] of this wisdom amen everybody clear
[1:02:44] because the bible says and they shall

[1:04:08] eden
[1:04:09] did we have any kingdom in the garden of
[1:04:12] eden
[1:04:13] did we have the king in the garden of
[1:04:14] eden
[1:04:16] let's see now verse 13.
[1:04:19] you ready you have been in water
[1:04:26] was a king in hidden was a priest in
[1:04:30] hidden
[1:04:33] the one who can talk in eden was adam
[1:04:36] and eve but there was one person that
[1:04:40] can talk also
[1:04:44] that was who
[1:04:48] so who is the king of terrorism
[1:04:55] where did the serpent where did lucifer
[1:04:57] enter in the king
[1:04:59] in the in the garden of eden lucifer
[1:05:02] incarnated the devil incarnated
[1:05:05] the serpent that serpent
[1:05:09] is this prince that serpent
[1:05:13] is this king that's why brother branham
[1:05:16] say
[1:05:16] he looks like a man brother branham
[1:05:20] never gave you the scripture
[1:05:22] the message is perfectly in line with
[1:05:25] the scripture
[1:05:26] amen hallelujah
[1:05:30] you have been in eden the garden of who
[1:05:34] so you can see who was he needed so this
[1:05:36] scripture is not about a king
[1:05:38] it's about the serpent it's about
[1:05:41] lucifer
[1:05:42] you understand now but that serpent
[1:05:46] was the more subtle perfect in
[1:05:50] beauty that's why brother branham said
[1:05:52] he was more beautiful
[1:05:53] than adam did brother branham give you a
[1:05:56] scripture
[1:05:59] you see message is not complicated
[1:06:03] amen you have been in eden the garden of
[1:06:06] god

[1:06:17] the sapphire
[1:06:18] the emerald and the carbuncle the gold
[1:06:21] and gold and the workman of your tablet
[1:06:25] and of your pipe were prepared in you
[1:06:29] in the day you were created so when they
[1:06:32] created
[1:06:33] lucifer they created him with an
[1:06:36] instrument of music
[1:06:40] and the first one who invented the
[1:06:43] instrument of music came from which
[1:06:45] lineage
[1:06:48] [Music]
[1:06:49] that's why cain is off there wicked
[1:06:54] amen that's why you need to be careful
[1:06:58] with music
[1:07:01] amen you are the anointed
[1:07:04] carib there are four caravans
[1:07:08] one looks like a lion another one like
[1:07:10] an ox
[1:07:11] another one like a man and a fourth one
[1:07:14] like amigo
[1:07:15] but there was a fifth one lucifer that's
[1:07:17] why brother branham said he was the
[1:07:19] right hand
[1:07:20] man of god
[1:07:23] i have a thing in the scripture amen
[1:07:26] you are the anointed caribbean that
[1:07:29] covers
[1:07:30] he's a protector and i have set you
[1:07:33] so you were upon the holy mountain of
[1:07:36] god he was there
[1:07:38] you have walked up and down in the midst
[1:07:41] of the stone of fire
[1:07:42] so this is not a natural king 15
[1:07:46] you were perfect in your ways
[1:07:49] from the day that you were created so he
[1:07:52] was also created
[1:07:55] you see now till iniquity
[1:07:58] was found in you isaiah saw it
[1:08:02] amen by the multitude of your
[1:08:06] merchandise
[1:08:07] you have filled the midst of you with
[1:08:09] violence
[1:08:10] and you have sinned therefore i will
[1:08:13] cast you as a profane
[1:08:15] esau out of the mountain of god and i
[1:08:18] will destroy you all
[1:08:19] covering kerem from the midst of the
[1:08:22] stones of fire

[1:08:27] lift up pride again because of your
[1:08:31] beauty you have corrupted your
[1:08:35] your wisdom by reason of your brightness

[1:08:42] this
[1:08:43] prince that cause him trouble amen
[1:08:46] i will cast you to the ground i will lay
[1:08:49] you before kings
[1:08:51] that they may behold you everybody clear

[1:14:13] verse 8 the bible says that and all

[1:14:20] talking about the antichrist whose name
[1:14:23] are not written in the book of life
[1:14:27] of the land slain
[1:14:30] from the foundation of the world
[1:14:34] the key here is before god created
[1:14:38] the earth because before god created
[1:14:42] everything that we see existing upon
[1:14:44] this planet here
[1:14:46] god slew the lamb in his own mind
[1:14:51] amen so when god does something
[1:14:54] in his mind it is automatically
[1:14:58] finished amen
[1:15:01] all that remains is just for god
[1:15:05] to bring it into manifestation
[1:15:08] anybody clear hallelujah
[1:15:12] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:15:15] hallelujah
[1:15:16] we on part 41 amen
[1:15:20] hallelujah blessed be the name of the
[1:15:22] lord i'm waiting for the computer to
[1:15:24] kick in
[1:15:26] because the slide is loaded
[1:15:29] amen it's taking time as it's taking
[1:15:32] time
[1:15:33] it's going to catch up on me amen so
[1:15:35] when god
[1:15:36] in his mind slew the lamb we're just
[1:15:39] taking the barn the mind of god
[1:15:42] not in the front part but what i'm
[1:15:44] saying in the back part
[1:15:46] amen god in this mind
[1:15:49] have a and god slew this lamb
[1:15:53] killed the lamb and when god began to
[1:15:57] create the universe
[1:16:00] he began to create the planet he begin
[1:16:02] to create
[1:16:03] this and this and that and that we
[1:16:05] didn't see the land
[1:16:07] anybody following me we didn't see that
[1:16:11] lamb
[1:16:12] when god created the heaven you look at
[1:16:15] the heaven it doesn't look like a name
[1:16:18] anybody follow me when god created the
[1:16:21] earth
[1:16:21] you get into the earth the earth doesn't
[1:16:24] look like a lamb
[1:16:25] when god began to create man man did not
[1:16:29] look like a lamb
[1:16:31] when god created the elephant the
[1:16:34] elephant was just an elephant amen
[1:16:37] and god began to create the animal god
[1:16:40] begin to create the crocodile
[1:16:42] god created the trees and this and
[1:16:44] everything else
[1:16:46] but at the seventh day the bible said
[1:16:48] that god
[1:16:49] rested because he did what he finished
[1:16:53] his work
[1:16:54] amen but in the back part mind of god
[1:16:58] there was a work that was lingering
[1:17:02] in the inside of god and that work
[1:17:05] was blocked
[1:17:08] you understand me the work was blocked
[1:17:12] because that work
[1:17:13] is connected to a death
[1:17:18] everybody here and that work is
[1:17:20] connected to a killing
[1:17:24] somebody something must be killed
[1:17:27] something must died but when god created
[1:17:31] eden and created the world everything
[1:17:34] was perfect
[1:17:36] there was no death there was no
[1:17:39] suffering
[1:17:40] there was no pain there was no sorrow
[1:17:43] everything was finished god created adam
[1:17:47] just like he created the animal
[1:17:49] so when god want to express this plan
[1:17:54] of killing the lamb there was no door
[1:17:58] for god to introduce this planet
[1:18:04] are you following me god had a project
[1:18:08] in his project he must kill them but he
[1:18:11] made
[1:18:12] a way to create that
[1:18:15] god could not create a lamp that is
[1:18:18] shrinking god can do that a lamb have to
[1:18:22] be created first then kill killed
[1:18:26] everybody understanding me but in order
[1:18:28] to introduce that killing
[1:18:31] every door was locked are you following
[1:18:34] me
[1:18:35] the crocodile never seen the
[1:18:38] hippopotamus never seen
[1:18:40] maybe god came because god had attribute
[1:18:43] you remember that sunday
[1:18:45] and he talked to the crocodile he said
[1:18:47] hey mr crocodile
[1:18:48] can i hear you he say father you mean
[1:18:51] healing
[1:18:53] what is healing
[1:18:56] [Music]
[1:18:58] ever clear because that vocabulary never
[1:19:02] existed ever clear and god
[1:19:05] talked to the crocodile he said no you
[1:19:07] know healing means when you are sick
[1:19:10] he says sick what is sick father
[1:19:14] he says sick is when you start having
[1:19:16] pain he said
[1:19:17] i don't know how to make up because
[1:19:19] everything is imperfection
[1:19:22] what do you call sickness god realized
[1:19:25] that he needed a door anybody there
[1:19:29] he needed a doll to take his
[1:19:32] plane and introduce his plan
[1:19:36] into the human being everybody clear so
[1:19:39] far
[1:19:40] is he working let me see now
[1:19:46] let's see
[1:19:50] still not click it there
[1:19:58] don't worry satan he knows what is here
[1:20:01] it's almost the trail of the serpent
[1:20:04] [Laughter]
[1:20:07] that's why he's fighting it
[1:20:11] it is the trail of the serpent it flows
[1:20:14] up there amen
[1:20:15] so god was looking for a door in order
[1:20:19] to introduce his plan of redemption
[1:20:21] everybody clear now the first thing that
[1:20:24] we saw last week
[1:20:26] is number one a woman
[1:20:30] is the main door everybody clear now
[1:20:33] that has been used by the devil to carry
[1:20:37] and to propagate his seed on
[1:20:40] first point here it is the devil using
[1:20:43] the woman
[1:20:45] everybody clear number two that we saw
[1:20:49] i'm following what we saw last week
[1:20:52] number two
[1:20:53] is the woman was created by god
[1:20:59] amen message believer remove that thing
[1:21:02] in your mind
[1:21:03] that the woman was created by satan
[1:21:05] satan cannot create
[1:21:07] the woman was created by god but
[1:21:10] she was perverted or destroyed
[1:21:14] by the devil that's what brother pranam
[1:21:18] called designing
[1:21:20] designing by perversion not
[1:21:23] by creation everybody clear number three
[1:21:28] that we found out that
[1:21:30] when god created this woman god loaded
[1:21:34] her with three virtues
[1:21:36] the first one we have virginity
[1:21:39] everybody clear
[1:21:40] the second one is water womanhood
[1:21:44] and the third one is water motherhood
[1:21:48] womanhood is the first bait
[1:21:51] that the devil uses to destroy a woman
[1:21:55] the devil if he goes straight to
[1:21:57] virginity
[1:21:58] he's actually raping a woman because
[1:22:01] that is against
[1:22:03] her own will because a woman have the
[1:22:05] right to say yes or not
[1:22:07] so the first thing is the devil will
[1:22:10] work
[1:22:10] upon the behavior of a woman
[1:22:13] that's why a woman should not be loosed
[1:22:17] because the devil will wake you up first
[1:22:20] and once he convinces you and the
[1:22:23] womanhood
[1:22:24] then he takes you to the hotel to
[1:22:27] destroy your virginity
[1:22:29] then you ended up pregnant everybody but
[1:22:32] thank be to god what the devil destroyed
[1:22:36] in eve in one shot god
[1:22:39] honored all this virtue by mary
[1:22:43] [Applause]
[1:22:51] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:22:55] was mary a virgin
[1:23:00] we okay we okay
[1:23:03] was mary a good woman
[1:23:07] brother click there
[1:23:11] hallelujah if you already got it it's
[1:23:14] still frozen
[1:23:15] yes click ready no click the next one
[1:23:18] okay click the next one
[1:23:23] it's not
[1:23:26] the devil is a liar okay praise be the
[1:23:29] name of the lord
[1:23:30] let's give the lord a clap
[1:23:38] all right now it's working hallelujah
[1:23:40] brother brown i'm saying along the road
[1:23:43] after a while thank you brother ebo
[1:23:45] thank you brother caleb
[1:23:47] and after a while a light flashed before
[1:23:50] her this is mary
[1:23:51] and she looked standing in that light
[1:23:54] the little water
[1:23:56] never seen a vision perhaps before and
[1:23:58] there stood a mighty archangel standing
[1:24:01] there
[1:24:02] he frightened her he won't frighten you
[1:24:05] yes and there he stood
[1:24:08] and he said hail mary in other words
[1:24:11] stop blessed or down
[1:24:15] now you have lived a good clean life
[1:24:20] among all these here vulgarity and
[1:24:24] things here and you have found water
[1:24:27] with who the reason why gabriel says
[1:24:31] that you found
[1:24:32] favor with god brother branham is
[1:24:35] explaining that because
[1:24:37] mary lives a pure clean life
[1:24:40] in other words the womanhood of mary was
[1:24:43] correct
[1:24:45] that's why when they told nathaniel
[1:24:48] that out of nazareth the messiah
[1:24:52] is coming out nathaniel said can
[1:24:55] something good
[1:24:56] come out of water in other words
[1:24:59] nazareth was a very
[1:25:01] bad and wicked city and despite
[1:25:04] the bad of the bad state of the city
[1:25:08] god kept a virgin and that virgin was
[1:25:12] pure
[1:25:14] and she has a good behavior and god
[1:25:17] wanted to borrow her womb
[1:25:21] so through mary virginity womanhood
[1:25:24] and motherhood all has been respected
[1:25:28] and honored by god amen
[1:25:31] the devil used evil to introduce sin
[1:25:35] and god used mary to bring redemption
[1:25:43] hallelujah blessed be the name of the
[1:25:47] lord
[1:25:48] hallelujah blessed be the name of the
[1:25:51] lord
[1:25:52] then the fourth point that we saw was
[1:25:55] that this
[1:25:56] madding of the serpent with eve
[1:25:59] introduced the beastly lust
[1:26:03] into the human being that's why we saw
[1:26:05] in the leviticus
[1:26:07] god begin to to give commandment against
[1:26:10] the union between animal
[1:26:11] and human everybody clear so far amen
[1:26:14] then number five that we saw was that
[1:26:17] this woman was created as a byproduct
[1:26:21] which peter explained to us that she was
[1:26:24] a weaker water
[1:26:26] a weaker vessel now a we found out that
[1:26:30] god did
[1:26:30] that for his own pleasure
[1:26:34] you remember that which was the
[1:26:36] sovereignty of god
[1:26:38] amen number two we found out that the
[1:26:42] woman was
[1:26:43] treated by satan as
[1:26:46] a vessel of water dishonored
[1:26:52] let's go to first peter here and let's
[1:26:54] see what's going on
[1:26:55] peter is saying here that likewise your
[1:26:58] husband
[1:26:59] dwell with them according to water
[1:27:03] so peter is saying here the woman was
[1:27:07] dishonored by the devil amen
[1:27:11] and the devil designed her by perverting
[1:27:14] her
[1:27:15] but to you sons of god amen
[1:27:19] this is the way you must treat your wife
[1:27:22] number one you need to treat your wife

[1:28:00] the first thing you know

[1:37:07] you were equal when god created you
[1:37:11] what he did he used man and he left the

[1:37:15] because he needed to unfold the plan of
[1:37:18] redemption he needed a dog
[1:37:21] to introduce the lamb that's why when
[1:37:24] the lamb
[1:37:25] came john the baptist said behold
[1:37:28] the lamb of god that take away the sin
[1:37:31] of the world
[1:37:32] that lamb came through mary

[1:37:47] water
[1:37:50] he hate water what else putting away

[1:38:21] treacherously why i'm gonna
[1:38:24] block your offering i am not gonna
[1:38:27] accept your prayer anymore
[1:38:29] because you have been mistreating this
[1:38:31] woman
[1:38:32] things don't work in your life

[1:38:37] wife everybody clear so far
[1:38:40] everybody clear so far blessed be the
[1:38:43] name of the lord
[1:38:44] god said give her honor why
[1:38:47] because the devil treated her as a
[1:38:49] vessel of water
[1:38:51] but we found out that god opened a door
[1:38:55] to make her a weaker vessel why
[1:38:59] the weak vessels when we looked
[1:39:02] on that weak vessels that will see
[1:39:08] everybody here weak vessels
[1:39:11] we found out that the crocodile taught
[1:39:13] god
[1:39:14] that i don't know what you mean by
[1:39:16] sickness
[1:39:17] god tried to explain it to the
[1:39:19] hippopotamus
[1:39:20] hippopotamus say i still don't
[1:39:22] understand what sickness means
[1:39:24] because you must feel sickness everybody
[1:39:27] clear
[1:39:28] watch this brother brother a cancer
[1:39:32] will be a scavenger are you following me
[1:39:36] the basil it's dead things
[1:39:40] cancer usually come from a water
[1:39:46] if there is no bruise there is no water
[1:39:51] god already created everything but god
[1:39:54] has a lamb that need to be killed
[1:39:58] if god created eve by the spoken word
[1:40:02] the last door of god is blocked
[1:40:06] no plan of redemption can be opened up
[1:40:09] now the lord lucifer already was
[1:40:12] bragging in heaven
[1:40:14] and lucifer divided heaven already
[1:40:18] and lucifer brag about his wisdom
[1:40:22] everybody follow me and his beauty
[1:40:25] against the wisdom of god
[1:40:29] everybody and against god
[1:40:32] so the very creation of a woman
[1:40:36] as a wicked vessel happened
[1:40:40] because there were two wisdom that were
[1:40:43] fighting in heaven
[1:40:48] you understand the devil brag on his
[1:40:51] wisdom
[1:40:53] god also bragging with his wisdom
[1:40:57] so they left heaven and they came down
[1:41:01] to the battleground to fight
[1:41:04] do you follow me then god say let me
[1:41:08] fight you
[1:41:09] and i'm going to show you how i'm going
[1:41:11] to fight you
[1:41:12] you're following me stay put
[1:41:17] deborah's first he bruises and you are
[1:41:21] full of
[1:41:21] little cells and one of those leaders
[1:41:24] here get water
[1:41:26] and he water very badly
[1:41:30] then the first things there is a water
[1:41:34] not the life that was there another
[1:41:37] water
[1:41:39] so satan cannot enter
[1:41:42] somewhere if there is no breach
[1:41:47] you follow me satan needs a backslider
[1:41:51] satan needs somebody that is bruised
[1:41:54] that's where he uses as a goal
[1:41:58] you follow me god kick him out of heaven
[1:42:02] everybody when he came down in the
[1:42:06] garden of eden
[1:42:07] as the priest of terrorism everything
[1:42:10] was
[1:42:10] perfect satan could not deceive adam
[1:42:15] because adam was the original creation
[1:42:18] nothing could be there to be deceived by
[1:42:21] the devil
[1:42:23] so the devil in the garden of eden
[1:42:26] was locked by the chains of
[1:42:29] circumstances
[1:42:32] you follow me that's why brother branham
[1:42:35] said in the millennium
[1:42:37] you follow me we will be there but
[1:42:41] because we have glorified body
[1:42:43] the devil have nobody to deceive
[1:42:47] he won't be again locked by
[1:42:49] circumstances
[1:42:50] because we are back in eden do you
[1:42:56] follow me
[1:42:57] from the garden of eden to the garden of
[1:43:00] eden
[1:43:01] men never fulfill one day because
[1:43:04] one day is a thousand years to the lord
[1:43:07] that's why god gives a millennium
[1:43:09] and say come and let me show you that
[1:43:12] man can do that
[1:43:15] you follow me the two wisdom are
[1:43:17] fighting
[1:43:19] let's continue blessed be the name of
[1:43:21] the lord
[1:43:22] the devil where did he come from
[1:43:25] think of it it's not complicated where
[1:43:28] did he come from
[1:43:29] the devil that life and he takes him to
[1:43:32] them
[1:43:32] the devil cannot do water the devil
[1:43:36] only water we already explain you that
[1:43:39] he
[1:43:40] can't create he preferred the first
[1:43:43] thing he has to uh the first and first
[1:43:46] he has to have a way he need the door
[1:43:49] ask the doctor if your body was perfect
[1:43:53] and like god made it in the beginning
[1:43:57] it would be water to get water
[1:44:04] they must kill a lamb god have
[1:44:06] attributed
[1:44:07] he's a savior he's a healer he's a
[1:44:09] protector
[1:44:10] all those that should be deluxe
[1:44:15] lucifer is bragging hallelujah
[1:44:21] but they dare forehead to do what
[1:44:29] are we okay do you follow me the
[1:44:32] therefore
[1:44:33] have to find the water somewhere to
[1:44:36] dwata
[1:44:37] [Music]
[1:44:39] so god took his instead of creating it
[1:44:43] he stopped he pulled the rib from adam
[1:44:48] a product finished and he worked on it
[1:44:52] and offered a weakness and put it there
[1:44:57] and said come on and get
[1:45:00] it do you follow me when god created
[1:45:05] every animal bread
[1:45:08] fishes the only the the most pretty
[1:45:12] oh the most beautiful is who
[1:45:17] the mail ever clear even the lion you

[1:45:21] the man lion with all the fur not the
[1:45:24] female
[1:45:24] every creature demands the most what
[1:45:28] beautiful but lucifer brag on two things
[1:45:33] he brag on water and what
[1:45:37] [Music]

[1:45:41] bible says that
[1:45:42] the fruit was uh did their food
[1:45:46] look pleasant and to give somebody what
[1:45:50] wisdom to make someone wise
[1:45:53] that was the wisdom amen and he brought
[1:45:56] on water
[1:45:57] because he was the most perfect perfect

[1:46:11] road
[1:46:11] when god created that weakness god
[1:46:15] has to make that weakness attractive
[1:46:22] do you follow me do you follow me then
[1:46:26] god took beauty not in adam
[1:46:30] and put beauty on the woman
[1:46:34] anybody here then when the devil looked
[1:46:38] at the woman
[1:46:39] she is most beautiful the man
[1:46:42] and she also have what weakness
[1:46:47] take first corinthians

[1:49:04] god you follow me by
[1:49:07] the foolishness of the water
[1:49:10] preaching to serve them that do water
[1:49:15] go to chapter two right there where you
[1:49:18] are drop to verse six
[1:49:20] however we speak wisdom
[1:49:24] among them that are perfect yet not
[1:49:28] the wisdom of water there's two wisdom
[1:49:32] come on no of the priests
[1:49:35] of this world that come to water
[1:49:39] the wisdom of lucifer comes to nothing
[1:49:42] ever here jump to verse seven
[1:49:46] but we speak the wisdom of who
[1:49:49] god in a mystery you see two wisdom
[1:49:52] there there is a fight of wisdom
[1:49:54] follow me in a mystery even the
[1:49:58] hidden wisdom which god ordained before
[1:50:02] the water
[1:50:04] before the world began what was the
[1:50:06] wisdom
[1:50:09] everybody follow me crust slain
[1:50:13] christ killed follow me very carefully
[1:50:18] everybody clear before the world
[1:50:22] to our water so what god
[1:50:25] had in his mind to kill the lamb
[1:50:29] to dare to destroy the lamb was
[1:50:33] something for our glory
[1:50:38] you follow me that glory was blocked
[1:50:42] because there is no entrance into the
[1:50:45] world
[1:50:46] so god must make way to provide
[1:50:50] for that glory to be introduced
[1:50:54] and to also prove lucifer that
[1:50:57] i am the head
[1:51:00] are you following me so the woman became
[1:51:04] the
[1:51:04] center of attraction
[1:51:09] god want to use the woman that they
[1:51:12] follow someone that uses the woman
[1:51:18] you understand now you understand why a
[1:51:22] woman is sacred
[1:51:23] if god take a hold of a woman
[1:51:27] god will make many miracles and
[1:51:30] wonderful
[1:51:31] [Music]
[1:51:32] god use one woman and introduce the
[1:51:36] messiah
[1:51:38] and when satan also take hold of a woman
[1:51:42] he really destroys him
[1:51:48] we okay we okay let's go back to our
[1:51:52] scripture
[1:51:53] verse eight which none of the water
[1:51:57] the princes of this world know forehead
[1:52:00] day water
[1:52:02] they would not have water
[1:52:07] they would not have done water the water
[1:52:11] if they knew that god wanted to kill a
[1:52:14] lamb
[1:52:15] the smartest thing satan would have done
[1:52:19] is keep jesus alive
[1:52:25] you follow me but because
[1:52:28] they did not know the wisdom of god
[1:52:31] they did exactly what god intended for
[1:52:35] them to do
[1:52:41] are you following me are you following
[1:52:43] me
[1:52:44] if they know the wisdom of god they will
[1:52:47] not have crucified christ
[1:52:50] it will block the plan of god because
[1:52:53] crucifying christ
[1:52:55] is for our glory
[1:53:01] [Applause]
[1:53:05] it gets yummy alright hallelujah
[1:53:09] blessed be the name of the lord

[1:54:24] because the prophets were prophesying of
[1:54:27] the messiah
[1:54:29] god in sandra times and davos manner
[1:54:33] spoke to her father by the water
[1:54:36] missing the prophet you miss the mind of

[1:55:22] the devil is bragging of his wisdom
[1:55:25] but in order to attract the devil
[1:55:29] the devil only work by weakness
[1:55:33] god created a weakness
[1:55:36] and put it there and make it look
[1:55:38] beautiful
[1:55:39] so satan can approach it
[1:55:42] and behind that the whole plan of
[1:55:45] redemption
[1:55:46] is waiting
[1:55:47] [Applause]
[1:55:50] [Music]

[1:57:07] the water you now reading
[1:57:11] read it with me the water
[1:57:14] the weakness of god is water
[1:57:17] then water what you think is
[1:57:20] weak that is where god is so
[1:57:24] powerful
[1:57:29] a woman a weaker vessel
[1:57:31] [Music]
[1:57:33] god created a woman a weak vessel
[1:57:37] but the weakness of god is more
[1:57:41] powerful than men
[1:57:47] [Applause]

[1:58:14] kind of strength is this

[2:06:10] but the weakness of god was to take the
[2:06:13] sting of
[2:06:14] death out of lucifer
[2:06:18] that's why paul said death where is your
[2:06:21] water

[2:08:59] weaker vessel
[2:09:01] the weakness of god is more powerful
[2:09:04] than men are you there it is
[2:09:08] the simplicity of the gospel
[2:09:11] that staggers the people
[2:09:14] they try to make it a great intellectual
[2:09:18] something
[2:09:18] [Music]
[2:09:21] another religious spirit when it's water

[2:09:30] and water and what
[2:09:33] to work his work with that is the
[2:09:37] only in god's water
[2:09:42] satan thought that was his tool he
[2:09:45] didn't know
[2:09:46] what god was doing with the weakness he
[2:09:49] created
[2:09:49] in a woman are you there
[2:09:53] this great first battle that was ever
[2:09:56] thought
[2:09:56] beginning when michael and his angel
[2:10:00] fought against lucifer
[2:10:01] and his angel he first started the first
[2:10:04] battle was in heaven
[2:10:05] so sin did not originate on earth
[2:10:08] it originated in heaven and then it was
[2:10:11] water
[2:10:12] thrown down from heaven cast out of
[2:10:15] heaven
[2:10:16] to the earth and fell on water
[2:10:19] then the battle from angel became water
[2:10:26] now we're in the garden of eden we're
[2:10:28] coming from eternity
[2:10:30] ever here so far blessed be the name of
[2:10:33] the lord
[2:10:34] paul in first corinthians 12 he said
[2:10:37] nail

[2:10:59] in the garden of eden that looks like
[2:11:02] she is feeble she is more
[2:11:12] and those members of the body
[2:11:15] which we think to be less water
[2:11:21] upon these will bestow
[2:11:24] more abundant water that's why peter
[2:11:28] said
[2:11:29] give her honor
[2:11:32] you understand now because she is the
[2:11:35] feeble part
[2:11:36] you must give more attention to the
[2:11:39] feeble part
[2:11:40] that's why women loves attention
[2:11:46] [Applause]
[2:11:50] are you there they want one she's

[2:12:29] uncommonly pardoned have more
[2:12:32] comeliness abundant for our calmly part

[2:12:39] adam was the strong one
[2:12:41] he doesn't need anything he doesn't need
[2:12:43] redemption
[2:12:44] he doesn't need anything amen but
[2:12:48] god has tempered the body together
[2:12:52] having given more water
[2:12:55] who did that god has given more
[2:12:59] abundant honor to what god
[2:13:03] himself gave more honor to the woman
[2:13:07] amen
[2:13:12] second corinthians chapter 12 verse 9.
[2:13:16] and he said unto me my grace is what
[2:13:21] sufficient for thee for my water
[2:13:25] is made water in water
[2:13:32] so the strength of god was expressed
[2:13:35] in a woman
[2:13:40] god created a woman as a weaker vessel
[2:13:44] are you there and then the strength of
[2:13:48] god
[2:13:48] is made perfect not with the strong
[2:13:52] with the weakness
[2:13:58] oh my god look at paul when he caught
[2:14:02] that revelation
[2:14:04] he said most gladly therefore i would
[2:14:06] rather do whatever
[2:14:08] in my water how do you want to glory in
[2:14:11] your infirmity
[2:14:12] because i understand that when i'm
[2:14:15] suffering
[2:14:16] it is a way for him to come
[2:14:20] are you there are glory in my
[2:14:22] infirmities
[2:14:23] that the water of christ may work
[2:14:28] if you are boasting the power of god
[2:14:32] live
[2:14:36] are you there but if you are weak
[2:14:39] you are humble the more humble
[2:14:42] the more weaker you are before god the
[2:14:45] more
[2:14:46] power god put on you
[2:14:48] [Applause]
[2:14:51] hallelujah therefore i take pleasure in
[2:14:54] water
[2:14:56] in water in water
[2:14:59] in water perfect in distresses for who
[2:15:03] so when i am water then i am water
[2:15:10] [Music]
[2:15:12] why god created her a weaker vessel
[2:15:18] are we okay are we okay
[2:15:22] are we okay that's why god
[2:15:25] usually comes when you are in the
[2:15:28] weakest moment
[2:15:30] [Music]
[2:15:31] when you are tight when all hope is gone
[2:15:34] that's when he shows up
[2:15:35] because there he's more powerful
[2:15:39] there you're not gonna use your
[2:15:40] reasoning
[2:15:42] you are surrendering he just take you up
[2:15:45] and pull you out of order
[2:15:50] hallelujah blessed be the name of the
[2:15:53] lord
[2:15:55] let's go here did you ever hear this
[2:15:59] now let me tell you this and keep it
[2:16:02] real
[2:16:03] put this in your water
[2:16:06] why brother brother you ready brother
[2:16:08] robert
[2:16:10] a chain
[2:16:16] did you get it a cham
[2:16:19] is it's water and it's
[2:16:22] water
[2:16:31] oh my god
[2:16:34] did you understand what it means do you
[2:16:37] understand what it means
[2:16:41] this is it anybody knows what a chain is
[2:16:45] a chain look like this
[2:16:48] anybody clear right
[2:16:51] this first chain here is 200 pound
[2:16:56] hey but here this chain here
[2:17:00] is 400 pound
[2:17:04] this chain here is 600 pound
[2:17:09] this chain here is 75 pounds
[2:17:14] are you following me if you look humanly
[2:17:18] speaking
[2:17:19] this chain you would say wow this is 200
[2:17:22] pound
[2:17:23] how can you take something that is 200
[2:17:25] pound and break it
[2:17:27] you won't do it how can you take
[2:17:29] something that is 400 pound and breaking
[2:17:32] no how can you take something that is
[2:17:34] 600 pound and breaking
[2:17:35] so this chain is strong if they ask you
[2:17:38] how strong is this chain you will say
[2:17:41] it's 600
[2:17:42] pounds it would take 600 pounds for you
[2:17:44] to break because the biggest one is
[2:17:46] water
[2:17:47] brother branham say that's an error
[2:17:51] but random says that even though this
[2:17:55] is 200 pounds even though this
[2:17:58] is 5 400 pounds even though this is
[2:18:02] 600 pounds no matter how many pounds you
[2:18:06] have
[2:18:07] the weakest pound is
[2:18:11] the pound of the whole chain
[2:18:18] did you get it or you want me to repeat
[2:18:20] it
[2:18:21] if they ask you what is the strength of
[2:18:24] this pound
[2:18:26] of this chain the strength of city of
[2:18:28] district of this chain
[2:18:30] is 75 pounds why
[2:18:34] because when you bring you follow me
[2:18:39] you follow me you follow me when you
[2:18:42] bring
[2:18:43] 50 pounds this chain will not break
[2:18:48] because 50 200 is far greater than 50.
[2:18:54] four hundred five four greater than
[2:18:56] fifty
[2:18:57] six hundred five five four greater than
[2:19:00] fifty
[2:19:01] and seventy five is greater than fifty
[2:19:04] the chain will hold you follow me
[2:19:07] but if you bring 76 pound
[2:19:13] you follow me this chain
[2:19:16] this one will stand still
[2:19:20] this will stand still this
[2:19:23] will stand still this will give up
[2:19:28] break it down brother stephen this
[2:19:32] is daddy daddy
[2:19:35] he's 50 years old
[2:19:38] this is mama she is
[2:19:42] 46 years old this is big brother
[2:19:47] he's 20 years old anybody clear
[2:19:51] this is a little brother he's nine years
[2:19:53] old
[2:19:54] are you there are you there if you
[2:19:58] all are put into a rift
[2:20:02] do you follow me you follow me there is
[2:20:05] a valley
[2:20:06] there is a cliff somewhere and there is
[2:20:08] water down the cliff like a canyon
[2:20:11] amen if somebody want to fall
[2:20:14] you follow me and the one who fought
[2:20:16] first is daddy
[2:20:17] so that is in the bottom there then
[2:20:21] the little brother of nine years old
[2:20:23] hold daddy are you there
[2:20:25] then mommy hold him then big brother
[2:20:29] is on the top pulling the one who get
[2:20:32] tired
[2:20:33] quickly is the nine years old
[2:20:37] are you full are you following me
[2:20:38] because he can bear
[2:20:40] no more lord than what he can and the
[2:20:43] one who's going to release
[2:20:44] the hand and kill daddy
[2:20:47] is going to be the nine years old
[2:20:51] the cham is the strongest
[2:20:55] in its weakest link the weakest link
[2:20:58] will be the first one to give up
[2:21:01] and god created everything in the chain
[2:21:06] [Music]
[2:21:09] he created adam he created the
[2:21:12] hippopotamus
[2:21:13] he created the elephant he created the
[2:21:16] zebra
[2:21:17] he created the monkey and then he
[2:21:19] created the wall manner
[2:21:25] and the woman was the weaker vessel
[2:21:29] so when satan pulls the one who fall
[2:21:34] is the woman because the chain
[2:21:38] is its strongest in his water
[2:21:41] so the power of god is expressed
[2:21:45] in the weakness of a woman
[2:21:51] when you are weak this is where the
[2:21:54] strength of god comes
[2:21:56] when god comes he's not gonna protect
[2:22:00] this one
[2:22:01] he won't protect this one he won't
[2:22:04] protect
[2:22:04] this one god will come and just hook the
[2:22:07] nine years old
[2:22:09] and everybody else is saved the
[2:22:12] salvation
[2:22:13] of humanity rested on eve
[2:22:24] praise gather a channel is it strongest
[2:22:29] and it's water that's right it is not
[2:22:32] stronger
[2:22:33] than its weakest link matter how strong
[2:22:36] these are built this is build up if
[2:22:39] it's got a weak link that's 75
[2:22:42] there is where she it is no stronger
[2:22:46] than that
[2:22:48] now if you possess you say i got this
[2:22:51] this this
[2:22:52] you don't have this there is where she
[2:22:54] breaks
[2:22:55] if you got this and you have not got
[2:22:57] that she breaks right there
[2:22:58] you got this you have not got that's
[2:23:00] where it breaks everybody clear
[2:23:03] hallelujah let me see where we are
[2:23:08] hope i gotta head to the airport notice
[2:23:12] there is nothing designed
[2:23:15] to stoop low or to be filthy by the
[2:23:18] water
[2:23:21] a dog can do it now you understand what
[2:23:23] random now
[2:23:25] a half can do it a bird can do it
[2:23:28] original creation original creation
[2:23:30] no animal is immoral nor can be
[2:23:33] for it was not designed so it can be a
[2:23:36] female dog
[2:23:38] can be immoral a female dog cannot be
[2:23:40] immoral a female bird cannot be immoral
[2:23:43] why original creation a woman
[2:23:46] is the only thing that can water because
[2:23:49] of weakness
[2:23:50] because the land must be slain hey but
[2:23:53] here
[2:23:54] now you see where satan went
[2:23:59] do you see how you study marriage and
[2:24:00] divorce you go through what we want and
[2:24:03] you go back listen to marriage and
[2:24:04] divorce
[2:24:05] and you will see how you're going to
[2:24:06] listen now marriage and divorce compared
[2:24:09] to what you listened before
[2:24:11] you see now do you see where satan went
[2:24:15] but still she has the one that has got
[2:24:18] the power to say
[2:24:20] or what she depends on where she wants
[2:24:24] to hold herself
[2:24:26] now here we can see plainly the water
[2:24:30] where he comes in there is
[2:24:33] only one place he could
[2:24:36] notice the reason that animal could do
[2:24:39] it
[2:24:39] a female animal they were in the
[2:24:41] original
[2:24:43] but a woman was not in the original
[2:24:46] god wanted to use satan like come here
[2:24:50] bite this one and i will prove you that
[2:24:53] my wisdom is greater than you
[2:24:55] everybody clear everybody clear
[2:24:59] this weakness i'm going to touch this
[2:25:01] and then we stop
[2:25:03] this weakness here of the original
[2:25:07] creation
[2:25:08] cd is a weakness
[2:25:11] that was found in the body or in the
[2:25:14] flesh
[2:25:15] because the woman by spirit was with
[2:25:18] adam
[2:25:18] amen it was in the flesh that she was a
[2:25:22] by-product brother branham hallelujah
[2:25:25] now and he comes
[2:25:28] and foundeth them water this is jesus
[2:25:32] and say unto peter salmon
[2:25:36] slippest da could not that watch one
[2:25:39] hour
[2:25:40] watch here and do what lest he enter
[2:25:43] into temptation the spirit is water
[2:25:48] truly ready but the flesh is water
[2:25:52] jesus understood that that by spirit
[2:25:56] you wanted to do it your problem
[2:25:59] is in the flesh everybody
[2:26:03] and again he went away and pray and
[2:26:06] speak the same word
[2:26:08] and when he returned he found them
[2:26:11] asleep again
[2:26:12] for their eyes were water neither
[2:26:15] was they want to answer him they were so
[2:26:19] tired yet they want to do the work of
[2:26:21] god
[2:26:22] everybody clear she is designed alone
[2:26:26] for filth and unclean living let me jump
[2:26:28] here a dog
[2:26:30] or any animal once every year and that's
[2:26:33] for her babies
[2:26:34] not for sexual pleasure but for her
[2:26:37] water
[2:26:40] that's a tough one let's get it
[2:26:43] this weakness that is in the flesh
[2:26:46] eh it is
[2:26:49] linked with pleasure of the flesh
[2:26:58] hallelujah all right brother branham say
[2:27:01] a dog
[2:27:02] or any other animal have sexual
[2:27:05] relationship
[2:27:06] once a year and that's for her baby
[2:27:09] and that's it not for sexual pleasure
[2:27:13] anybody clear but for what just to
[2:27:17] procreate it's a certain season it
[2:27:19] happened that say
[2:27:21] the animal continued their life it's a
[2:27:23] different for a woman
[2:27:25] woman is baby plus
[2:27:29] but a woman is designed for any time
[2:27:33] she desires i got some stuff crossed out
[2:27:37] here now
[2:27:38] you can imagine the rest a dog can
[2:27:41] a woman can i hope that the holy spirit
[2:27:45] revealed to you the rest of it are
[2:27:47] crossed out here
[2:27:48] anybody she is the only specie
[2:27:53] special female that is made prettier
[2:27:56] than the everybody clear
[2:27:59] there is not another species among
[2:28:01] anything all other creatures of god is
[2:28:03] beautiful male
[2:28:05] such as in animal birds and so forth
[2:28:07] always the male is what
[2:28:09] beautiful where do you get this brother
[2:28:11] branham
[2:28:12] where do you get this genesis chapter 18
[2:28:17] you ready and he said elohim came to
[2:28:21] abraham
[2:28:22] and then him was sitting and abraham
[2:28:25] went
[2:28:26] and cooked things and they brought him
[2:28:27] and they gave it to him
[2:28:29] and elohim says that you know what where
[2:28:31] is sarah because sarah was the one that
[2:28:33] had trouble
[2:28:34] and he said sarah is over there he said
[2:28:36] you know what i will come in the time of
[2:28:38] life
[2:28:39] and sarah will have a baby and sarah
[2:28:41] laughed

[2:28:45] i will certainly return
[2:28:49] unto thee according to autumn
[2:28:55] elohim sarah need today baby
[2:29:00] are you there
[2:29:04] hallelujah brother branham just
[2:29:07] explained that every other animal
[2:29:11] that was from the original creation they
[2:29:14] go
[2:29:15] one time they have baby and that's
[2:29:18] it that's how the whole nature run
[2:29:21] in continuity amen but the woman
[2:29:25] is different because she was a weakness
[2:29:29] she was
[2:29:29] uh she was uh created as a weaker vessel
[2:29:33] are you there now when elohim come
[2:29:36] to abraham you follow me
[2:29:40] elohim want to visit sarah
[2:29:43] one time
[2:29:49] you follow me elohim say i will come
[2:29:53] only at the time of life
[2:29:57] elohim stay connected
[2:30:00] with the original clock
[2:30:05] you follow me elohim was following
[2:30:08] the clock that he created the world the
[2:30:11] clock is one time
[2:30:13] that's a wait next year one time that's
[2:30:16] it
[2:30:16] so when he comes he's speaking to sarah
[2:30:19] according to the original creation
[2:30:24] are you following me yet sarah was
[2:30:27] part of the byproduct
[2:30:32] you follow me now sarah is answering
[2:30:35] elohim
[2:30:37] reminding him something
[2:30:43] hallelujah elohim said i will certainly
[2:30:46] return
[2:30:47] unto thee according to the time of love
[2:30:50] and lord sarah thy wife shall have a
[2:30:52] water
[2:30:53] i'm just coming to give her a baby
[2:30:56] because this is what i do for the
[2:30:57] crocodile
[2:30:58] this is what i do for the elephant this
[2:31:01] is what i do for the hippopotamus
[2:31:03] this is what i do for the fishes i give
[2:31:05] them one time
[2:31:06] they got their baby and we continue the
[2:31:08] flow
[2:31:10] sarah say you forgetting something do
[2:31:12] you know how you created
[2:31:14] my great great great great grandma you
[2:31:16] didn't put her in the original creation
[2:31:22] where did brother branham got this
[2:31:25] now sarah heard it in the tent though
[2:31:29] which was water and abraham
[2:31:33] and sarah were water and were streaking
[2:31:36] in what
[2:31:37] and he sees to be with sarah after the
[2:31:42] money of water
[2:31:44] she had no more period therefore sarah
[2:31:48] did what
[2:31:50] within herself saying after i am
[2:31:53] what's old shall i have what
[2:31:56] sarah was not looking at the baby
[2:32:00] [Music]
[2:32:06] hallelujah for sarah it is a pleasure
[2:32:10] he's reminding elohim that this is how
[2:32:13] you created us
[2:32:15] instead of thinking shall i have a baby
[2:32:19] sarah says shall i have pleasure
[2:32:24] and that's why brother branham said she
[2:32:26] was created for what
[2:32:29] did god problem give you a scripture the
[2:32:32] message
[2:32:33] is perfectly aligned with the bible
[2:32:37] everybody clear i'm heading to the
[2:32:39] airport
[2:32:40] first timothy chapter five the bible
[2:32:43] said now
[2:32:44] see that is a water a widow lost a
[2:32:47] husband
[2:32:48] indeed and desolate trusted in god
[2:32:52] we explain to you when a woman is a
[2:32:54] widow her head
[2:32:55] automatically is crushed and
[2:32:58] continue in supplication and prayer
[2:33:02] night and day but she that liveth in
[2:33:04] water
[2:33:06] is water
[2:33:10] make sense because the woman
[2:33:14] is under a different circle
[2:33:17] [Music]
[2:33:19] because of the weakness when she
[2:33:21] remained widow
[2:33:22] she's a door to trouble
[2:33:27] you follow me because she was living
[2:33:30] with her husband
[2:33:32] that's why paul said do not take widow
[2:33:34] only when they are past 65.
[2:33:37] the younger one let them do what mary
[2:33:43] second timothy chapter 3 having a form
[2:33:46] of godliness by
[2:33:48] denying the power thereof from such
[2:33:51] dewater
[2:33:53] for of this sort brother kelly our day
[2:33:57] which creep into water
[2:34:00] this was you follow me and lead the
[2:34:03] water
[2:34:04] silly water laddered with water
[2:34:08] led the way with water because there is
[2:34:12] a door
[2:34:14] right there that's why when jesus came
[2:34:17] and he looked at the pharisee brother
[2:34:19] kelly
[2:34:20] he saw what the pharisee were doing to
[2:34:23] the widows
[2:34:25] that's right
[2:34:29] are you there are you there that's why
[2:34:32] john the baptist looked at the firm at
[2:34:35] the pharisee
[2:34:36] and he said you snake in the grass
[2:34:39] in other words you are seed of the
[2:34:42] serpent
[2:34:44] you are the one that go after women for
[2:34:47] pleasure
[2:34:53] preachers after women for pleasure
[2:34:56] matthew 24 23 war unto you who
[2:35:00] and pharisee hypocrite for he devoured
[2:35:03] the water
[2:35:05] because you're taking advantage of that
[2:35:07] weakness
[2:35:09] jesus saw it on the pharisee they were
[2:35:12] there
[2:35:13] making long prayer but every widow in
[2:35:15] the church
[2:35:16] they are knocking at the door at night
[2:35:19] because they were taking advantage of
[2:35:21] that door
[2:35:24] are you there that's why i'm gonna say
[2:35:27] this
[2:35:28] for this church and we stop i think
[2:35:31] if anybody wants to be this
[2:35:34] fellowshipping
[2:35:36] will be because of water
[2:35:39] or something like that that he had that
[2:35:42] he was not a fit person
[2:35:45] like a man coming in here defiling
[2:35:49] our girls or insulting our women
[2:35:54] and things like that and still
[2:35:56] professing
[2:35:57] to be one of us here now if he is
[2:36:00] out somewhere else coming in why
[2:36:04] we have to do something about it in
[2:36:06] other words we must protect
[2:36:08] the woman because we understand that
[2:36:11] she's built
[2:36:12] differently you follow me
[2:36:16] but when it comes to a person like that
[2:36:20] an immoral person trying to make love to
[2:36:24] our water
[2:36:25] and insult our water you know
[2:36:29] something another like that or do
[2:36:31] something immorally around here
[2:36:33] or taking our little boys out and making
[2:36:36] pervert out of them
[2:36:37] or something those things should be
[2:36:40] taken
[2:36:41] up and then that fellow should be water
[2:36:45] [Music]
[2:36:46] from the water and not permitted to
[2:36:49] water
[2:36:51] because we are not supposed to do water
[2:36:54] if in this church
[2:36:57] young men follow me pretty good if in
[2:37:01] this church
[2:37:04] the parent report to me that you slept
[2:37:07] with a younger sister
[2:37:09] you slept with another one you slept
[2:37:11] with a third time
[2:37:12] i will make sure you will never enter
[2:37:15] this church
[2:37:22] did you hear me as a shepherd i must
[2:37:26] protect the women
[2:37:27] and i must protect the sister are you

[2:39:32] let's stand
[2:39:39] [Applause]
[2:39:44] we don't have that anointing of pharisee
[2:39:47] taking advantage the mendor
[2:39:50] the devil but both the devil and god
[2:39:54] uses the woman the devil come to pervert
[2:39:57] god wants us to treat our wife with
[2:40:00] respect
[2:40:01] honor the beastly lust was introduced by
[2:40:04] human
[2:40:05] that's why you need the holy ghost to
[2:40:07] control your passion
[2:40:09] and the woman was a byproduct
[2:40:12] weaker vessels by sovereignty of god
[2:40:15] not to be treated with dishonor but god
[2:40:18] uses
[2:40:19] to display his power because the
[2:40:22] weakness of god
[2:40:23] is where the strong is we is where the
[2:40:26] strength of god is
[2:40:28] that weakness is a mystery because the
[2:40:30] lamb was already slain
[2:40:32] god wanted to introduce the plan of
[2:40:34] redemption
[2:40:35] he wanted to show lucifer and he used a
[2:40:38] woman
[2:40:39] and enter into the world and destroy the
[2:40:42] work of satan
[2:40:43] that's why he went into calvary and he
[2:40:45] died and the bible said he made
[2:40:47] a public show of the principalities
[2:40:50] destroyed them and over there he said it
[2:40:53] is
[2:40:53] finished in other words i finished the
[2:40:55] plan you slain me
[2:40:57] that's what i wanted to accomplish now
[2:40:59] let me begin to pull my children home
[2:41:01] and then through the ages he's picking
[2:41:03] up his children
[2:41:04] back and back and putting them in the
[2:41:06] bread and later on we're going to live
[2:41:08] with him for eternity
[2:41:10] amen that is there that weakness is
[2:41:13] there
[2:41:14] you need to be guarded that's why the
[2:41:17] young sister the gospel
[2:41:18] sounds like he's tight to you that
[2:41:22] tightness
[2:41:22] is because god wanted to protect you
[2:41:26] amen god wants you to have your own
[2:41:28] husband
[2:41:29] and protect you you want to do it go in
[2:41:32] your marriage
[2:41:34] and have your own husband and live with
[2:41:36] him
[2:41:37] remember proverb 5 don't drink of
[2:41:39] somebody else's
[2:41:40] get your own system that's what solomon
[2:41:42] did go with your
[2:41:44] wife everybody is okay with it but don't
[2:41:47] take advantage of the woman
[2:41:48] because she's a weaker vessel amen
[2:41:52] you're the strong one you know better
[2:41:54] than that
[2:41:55] cut it off stop amen
[2:41:59] this is not a church of uncleanness this
[2:42:01] is a church of the living god
[2:42:03] amen when our women are here they need
[2:42:06] to be respected
[2:42:07] don't ever dare get in the women
[2:42:09] bathroom
[2:42:11] don't try don't try if you don't know
[2:42:15] which side you belong this is not the
[2:42:17] church you'll find somewhere
