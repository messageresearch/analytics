[47:13] used it and dealt with it and then we
[47:16] move forward but if I touch it right now
[47:19] will
[47:21] it's a teaching it just doesn't need one

[48:09] then give amen
[48:11] our next house missing about our house
[48:13] meeting will be on October the 29th
[48:17] so it's always a Saturday remember that
[48:20] put that on your calendar and again it's
[48:22] going to be the young people handling it
[48:24] amen so the old mature folks are taking
[48:27] it easy all the young people will handle
[48:30] it amen I want you to work harder
[48:33] more than where we are you're already
[48:35] working so hard and I'm proud of you I
[48:38] see you over there playing the guitar I
[48:40] mean playing the the drums backing up I
[48:43] want you to be really really really
[48:45] involved what we usually call Young
[48:49] it's a waste of time
[48:53] when you think you're still young you
[48:55] already graduated from high school and
[48:57] you say I'm still young I still have a
[48:59] lot of time are you wasting your time
[49:00] you will realize that's the perfect time
[49:04] for you to do so many things
[49:07] and be established because right after
[49:10] high school Tom goes
[49:13] before you know it three years four
[49:15] years five years is gone we ask you what
[49:18] are you doing nothing
[49:20] what is in your bank account overdraft
[49:24] which major are you trying to do no
[49:26] you're still flipping from here from
[49:27] here from here so somewhere the GPS is
[49:30] lost
[49:32] amen so we want to refocus the GPS we
[49:35] route the GPS back again especially for
[49:38] the Young Folks
[49:39] so young adults talk to the Deacon
[49:42] schedule a meeting let's sit down and
[49:44] talk a little bit
[49:48] did I say anything wrong
[49:50] that's anything wrong
[49:52] you need to get to position quickly so
[49:54] we can handle some of the stuff
[50:00] if you hear what that
[50:01] did you hear what I said you are the one
[50:04] who's slowing the position
[50:08] did they hear me
[50:11] you didn't understand what I'm saying
[50:14] who didn't understand what I'm saying
[50:18] [Laughter]
[50:23] if you need the coach you see me that
[50:26] it's not to the woman to be seeking
[50:28] after the man
[50:31] you need that coach you see me
[50:35] so the sister don't goes looking for me
[50:44] don't worry I'll find the quote and put
[50:46] on WhatsApp chat so everybody found it
[50:48] then you're gonna say Amen on the
[50:51] WhatsApp chat everybody okay so it's up
[50:54] to the man
[50:55] that's gonna go ahead and do it
[50:58] but if the man is not in position
[51:05] you're the one wasting the time
[51:08] you need to get a good job
[51:12] you need to get the Holy Ghost
[51:14] [Music]
[51:16] man must have the Holy Ghost
[51:19] and they must have a good job
[51:22] where they can handle the bills without
[51:25] the system you make sure you handle your
[51:27] own bill
[51:30] before they bring you the hair bills and
[51:32] all the kind of bills so you make sure
[51:34] you handle your own bills
[51:37] so you get to position
[51:41] when you get to position most of the
[51:43] stuff will be handled quickly
[51:45] then you're gonna see Revelation popping
[51:47] up you're blind because you're not in
[51:49] your position that's why you don't see
[51:52] that's fine let's go to our scripture
[51:57] you heard what I say right
[52:02] you are 20 years old I'm still too young
[52:05] you're not Young
[52:08] 20 years old or I'm 18 years old I'm
[52:11] young you're not Young

[52:39] parents I say okay they don't move put
[52:41] them in bills
[52:43] let them stop paying bills at home
[52:48] because they're buying too much Amazon
[52:52] they don't have anything to do with the
[52:54] money when money comes they keep buying
[52:56] online put them on the bills
[53:01] let them be responsible
[53:03] put them on the bills
[53:07] so those four checks they cut one out
[53:10] and the offering cut another one
[53:13] the other one I won't say he cut the
[53:16] other one
[53:17] then you then you're gonna learn

[1:04:50] one of this day you will remember me
[1:04:53] Daniel chapter 2 verse 32 this image
[1:04:57] that we know clearly
[1:04:59] was a fine gold
[1:05:02] it's breast and its arm
[1:05:07] the head is only one Amen in the body
[1:05:12] if you see somebody with two heads
[1:05:14] something is wrong we only have one head
[1:05:17] everybody okay
[1:05:18] but the arm we got two armed
[1:05:21] because the image was a human being
[1:05:24] you got two armor and you got two
[1:05:26] breasts
[1:05:27] so this
[1:05:28] head is one but the second Kingdom
[1:05:35] the second Kingdom
[1:05:38] have
[1:05:39] two arms
[1:05:41] two breasts
[1:05:44] and two arms
[1:05:48] amen
[1:05:49] so it's a kingdom that is double
[1:05:54] amen amen the barbicolonian is single
[1:05:58] but this one is double
[1:06:01] everybody okay
[1:06:04] you have two kingdoms
[1:06:09] that are connected
[1:06:12] or joint
[1:06:14] join together
[1:06:18] everybody okay
[1:06:22] that's why the code let me just help you
[1:06:24] up that's why they call this the middle
[1:06:29] Persian
[1:06:31] everybody okay we you got the middies
[1:06:35] and ugada
[1:06:38] Persia amen the midi and the Persia are
[1:06:42] hooked together they form one Kingdom
[1:06:45] because you have a right arm and you got
[1:06:48] a left arm
[1:06:49] but both of them are made they are both
[1:06:52] under the silver
[1:06:59] everybody okay
[1:07:01] if I rob you they'll
[1:07:04] the way you usually don't like I'm so
[1:07:07] happy
[1:07:10] this image was a fine gold
[1:07:13] it's breast and its arm of silver
[1:07:18] and it's barely and it's sad and its
[1:07:22] ties of water grass
[1:07:25] so after silver
[1:07:28] follow the brass
[1:07:32] which has the belly
[1:07:35] and the tie
[1:07:37] everybody okay
[1:07:38] let's go to Daniel 7 verse 4.
[1:07:42] you need your Bible
[1:07:44] and those who read Daniel 8 Daniel 9 is
[1:07:47] going to be easier on you
[1:07:50] those who didn't read you have to stay
[1:07:53] focused
[1:07:55] and I will encourage you to go home and
[1:07:57] to read it
[1:08:00] there is nothing in the Bible that is
[1:08:02] written just by any chance
[1:08:05] I believe you already learned in this
[1:08:07] church the Tabernacle was like a mystery
[1:08:09] now you can walk in the Tabernacle and
[1:08:11] you begin to see this this this and
[1:08:13] everything is clear so there is nothing
[1:08:15] that is hidden in the scripture because
[1:08:18] the seal is already broken
[1:08:20] amen Daniel chapter 7 verse 4. if you
[1:08:24] dare you can say Amen
[1:08:27] the first
[1:08:28] Beast was like a lion
[1:08:31] and had the ego wings
[1:08:33] I beheld till the wings thereof were
[1:08:36] plucked we understand that language now
[1:08:38] and it was lift up from the earth we
[1:08:41] understand that language and made stand
[1:08:43] upon the feet as a man and a man's heart
[1:08:46] was given to him amen so this beasts
[1:08:50] become a human being become incarnated
[1:08:52] into a human being but what I want you
[1:08:55] to keep in that the first Beast is a
[1:08:59] combination of a lion
[1:09:01] and an eagle
[1:09:04] amen
[1:09:05] this is the kingdom of Babylon
[1:09:09] amen so Babylon you will see a lion
[1:09:14] and you must see an ego
[1:09:17] everybody okay when you see Babylon
[1:09:20] it's a lion but you must see an eagle
[1:09:23] and the ego is the one that keep
[1:09:25] everything under control
[1:09:27] when you take the eagle off
[1:09:29] then
[1:09:31] the lion will not be a beast anymore it
[1:09:34] will become a human being
[1:09:36] everybody okay
[1:09:38] glory to God verse 5 and behold another
[1:09:43] Beast a second like a water yeah
[1:09:47] the second beast is a bear
[1:09:52] Hallelujah
[1:09:54] glory to God
[1:09:56] the second beast is like a bear and he
[1:10:00] raised up itself
[1:10:02] on one side
[1:10:06] everybody care so this bear have two
[1:10:09] sides
[1:10:12] everybody okay
[1:10:14] scripture don't play
[1:10:18] brother Branham says
[1:10:20] now let this be known
[1:10:22] scripture doesn't play with words
[1:10:26] whatever is in the record it's there for
[1:10:29] the anointed as to what see it is there
[1:10:32] for a purpose everybody okay so far
[1:10:35] we okay so despair when it's raising
[1:10:39] it's raising on one side
[1:10:41] so the bear have two sides but he's
[1:10:44] using one side to rest
[1:10:49] so this bear
[1:10:51] have two sides
[1:10:54] but he's using one side
[1:10:58] amen
[1:10:59] so the power of this bed
[1:11:02] is more lean toward one side
[1:11:05] everybody okay
[1:11:07] so one sad is a Little Bit Stronger
[1:11:13] compared to the other side
[1:11:17] you follow me
[1:11:18] glory to God
[1:11:19] it's a different language so it's a
[1:11:22] military airplane to stay put on Amen
[1:11:26] and he had two eatings
[1:11:29] in the mouth
[1:11:31] and in the mouth of it between the teeth
[1:11:34] of it and they say that's to it erased
[1:11:38] devour much water so it's a beast that
[1:11:41] can kill really pretty bad
[1:11:43] amen and the mouth contained three ribs
[1:11:49] three
[1:11:51] and a rib
[1:11:52] three ribs one two three ribs so that
[1:11:55] it's a letter three with a rib we also
[1:11:58] know where the ribs means
[1:12:00] you know in Genesis right you know what
[1:12:03] they did to Adam right they pull the
[1:12:05] reef right
[1:12:06] okay
[1:12:07] let's go to verse six and after this
[1:12:12] I beheld and low another like a leopard
[1:12:16] the third one
[1:12:18] is a leopard
[1:12:23] glory to God
[1:12:25] another like a leopard this should be
[1:12:28] like a review
[1:12:30] which head upon its back upon the back
[1:12:33] of it how many wings four wings this
[1:12:37] leopard got four wings
[1:12:41] but four wings of a farm
[1:12:44] it is not an eagle
[1:12:47] everybody okay it has nothing to do with
[1:12:50] an ego it is just a bird
[1:12:53] the eagle is a bird this one is a file
[1:12:56] it's also a bird but it's not an eagle
[1:12:59] amen but the number is four
[1:13:02] everybody okay
[1:13:04] which head upon its back of it four
[1:13:07] wings of a fowl the Beast head also
[1:13:12] foreheads
[1:13:14] amen
[1:13:16] so this Beast has four wings and four
[1:13:19] hands
[1:13:20] in other words within this Beast
[1:13:24] amen everybody okay
[1:13:26] this beast when he's moving on
[1:13:29] he carried four things
[1:13:35] we okay
[1:13:37] this beast in his belly in his power
[1:13:41] amen he carry four powers joined
[1:13:45] together
[1:13:48] everybody here it's four heads
[1:13:51] and four wings so those four heads of a
[1:13:55] leopard are joined together
[1:13:58] it's like a kingdom that have four
[1:14:00] kingdoms
[1:14:02] everybody okay
[1:14:03] but those four kingdoms are joined
[1:14:06] together into one Beast
[1:14:08] we okay now
[1:14:09] glory to God
[1:14:11] you say the beasts also had four heads
[1:14:14] and Dominion was given to it so if we
[1:14:18] come back here the lion is just one with
[1:14:22] an ego the bear is working with two sad
[1:14:25] one of the sad is most stronger but the
[1:14:28] leopard have four Kingdom that are drawn
[1:14:32] together into one Kingdom
[1:14:35] everybody okay and we know the bear is
[1:14:38] the middle pigeon and we already seen
[1:14:40] that the middle Vision have two arm and
[1:14:43] two breasts
[1:14:45] we okay now but this one have number
[1:14:48] four
[1:14:49] everybody good let's go to Revelation
[1:14:52] chapter 17. then we will pray
[1:14:56] glory to God
[1:14:59] I know these books are
[1:15:02] kiwi people don't want to read them they
[1:15:05] run away from them
[1:15:07] they don't want to preach about it you
[1:15:10] hardly hear it but the very good good
[1:15:13] books
[1:15:14] the most complicated book that you find
[1:15:16] in the Bible got a lot of stuff that
[1:15:19] will explain you what's going on
[1:15:21] that's why we need a prophet Revelation
[1:15:24] chapter 17 verse 12. if you dare you can
[1:15:27] say Amen
[1:15:28] we read this last Sunday and the ten
[1:15:30] horns which you sow are Ten Kings which
[1:15:34] have no Kingdom as yet
[1:15:36] but receive power
[1:15:38] as king one hour with the Beast so there
[1:15:41] is a covenant with the Beast you
[1:15:43] remember last Sunday
[1:15:45] these have one mind they believe in one
[1:15:48] thing communism you remember that Sunday
[1:15:51] and shall give the power and strength to
[1:15:54] the Beast so they're going to be
[1:15:55] deceived somehow
[1:15:56] and join to the Beast thinking they're
[1:15:58] doing something good amen
[1:16:01] but the Shadi shall make war with the
[1:16:05] lamb
[1:16:08] amen
[1:16:10] glory to God
[1:16:12] these ten kingdoms
[1:16:15] or these Ten Kings
[1:16:17] which we saw last Sunday that it was 10
[1:16:20] dictators
[1:16:22] you remember
[1:16:23] amen which symbolizing the power of
[1:16:27] communism
[1:16:29] amen
[1:16:30] this power hit God
[1:16:37] we okay
[1:16:39] he hates the land
[1:16:43] amen he hits the lamp
[1:16:47] these shall make war with the lamb so
[1:16:51] there is an enmity between this group
[1:16:54] against the land
[1:16:56] and the lamb shall overcome them
[1:17:00] Armageddon is right here
[1:17:02] amen
[1:17:03] for he is Lord of lords and King of
[1:17:07] Kings if you remember when they say king
[1:17:09] of King it's throwing you to Revelation
[1:17:11] 19 when he's coming on the White Horse
[1:17:14] you remember in other words that's how
[1:17:16] the scripture is telling you go back to
[1:17:18] Revelation 19. amen for his Lord of Lord
[1:17:21] and king of King and they that are with
[1:17:25] him so the lamb doesn't come himself
[1:17:29] everybody okay remember in Revelation 19
[1:17:32] when he's coming there is an army
[1:17:34] following him and that Army was in fine
[1:17:37] learning which was the bride following
[1:17:40] him so the lamb comes with his brother
[1:17:42] and here the Bible says that the lamb
[1:17:46] and and the lamb and they that are with
[1:17:48] him because the bride is not one person
[1:17:51] it's a many members body that makes one
[1:17:55] bread of Jesus Christ
[1:17:56] amen so this Kingdom
[1:18:01] these power doesn't like you
[1:18:08] he doesn't like the lamb and the Bride
[1:18:12] of the Lamb
[1:18:14] amen that's why he makes war with the
[1:18:18] land and the bride because the husband
[1:18:21] and the wife are
[1:18:25] we okay
[1:18:27] glory to God
[1:18:29] he said and the lamb shall overcome them
[1:18:31] for he is Lord of lords and king of
[1:18:34] kings and they that are with him
[1:18:37] amen our call they are there that are
[1:18:41] with him are called we are called first
[1:18:45] amen now that we call the only Karma but
[1:18:48] we are also Chosen and not only are we
[1:18:52] chosen by we are water faithful
[1:18:57] everybody okay
[1:18:59] so the bride is faithful
[1:19:03] in whatever the brother does she's
[1:19:05] faithful
[1:19:06] she's faithful living in church
[1:19:10] she's faithful in reading her Bible
[1:19:15] everybody okay she's called she's Chosen
[1:19:19] and she is faithful and the lamb himself
[1:19:23] is the faithful and the true Witness
[1:19:28] you don't know that
[1:19:30] the Bible said that Jesus Christ is the
[1:19:32] faithful
[1:19:33] and the true witness we are faithful
[1:19:36] because he is also faithful in other
[1:19:38] words we become him
[1:19:42] everybody okay so the bride and the lamb
[1:19:45] are one
[1:19:47] everybody okay you can no more Jesus

[1:19:55] everybody okay where he goes we go with
[1:19:58] him

[1:20:01] because usually the bride stay in the
[1:20:04] palace and the King goes well but this
[1:20:08] is a different story now buff the bride
[1:20:11] and the King are going towards
[1:20:15] everybody care everybody care because

[1:20:42] husbands stand there and say get him
[1:20:44] beat him up

[1:20:59] you say you devil
[1:21:00] you remember what you did to me
[1:21:03] and he cannot say anything because the
[1:21:06] master is right there
[1:21:08] [Applause]
[1:21:12] when the bride will recognize who she is
[1:21:18] she will be a water
[1:21:22] when Jesus is coming with her nor me
[1:21:24] behind it's an invisible Army in other
[1:21:28] words the devil will never defeat you

[1:22:18] which you saw upon the Beast these shall
[1:22:21] hurt the whole so something will happen
[1:22:25] that will create enmity within the big
[1:22:28] system
[1:22:31] everybody okay and there will be a
[1:22:33] separation
[1:22:34] amen and that separation will cause the
[1:22:37] ten horn to turn around and come to
[1:22:40] revenge on the Beast amen and this shall
[1:22:44] hurt the whole and shall make her
[1:22:47] desolate and naked
[1:22:49] amen and shall eat her flesh
[1:22:53] and burn her with water fire so the

[1:23:57] you know they judge her because of the
[1:24:00] blood

[1:24:03] and the kings of the earth who have
[1:24:05] committed fornication
[1:24:07] and live deliciously with her shall be

[1:24:31] everybody okay
[1:24:32] let's pray Heavenly Father
[1:24:35] Lord once again we are approaching you
[1:24:37] humbly this morning Father thanking you
[1:24:40] for your grace for your love your mercy
[1:24:43] father and for everything you have been
[1:24:45] doing for us Lord we thank you for your
[1:24:47] protection against Lord this hurricane
[1:24:50] that was heading toward North Carolina
[1:24:53] father you protected us you protected
[1:24:55] our home father the impact that was
[1:24:58] predicted didn't even happen because of
[1:25:00] the prayer of your Saint Lord and father
[1:25:03] we can once again testify that the
[1:25:06] Judgment of this world is held because
[1:25:09] of the presence of the bread
[1:25:11] and father today on Sunday morning you
[1:25:14] gave us a beautiful day with the sun
[1:25:17] shining and gave us also the desire and
[1:25:20] opportunity to come into your house to
[1:25:22] Fellowship together Lord with scent of
[1:25:25] like Precious Faith around the revealed
[1:25:27] word of the hour Lord may you forgive us
[1:25:30] for everything we grieve the Holy Spirit
[1:25:32] may you move every demonic Spirit of
[1:25:35] resentment every spirit that will
[1:25:37] trouble the people or distract them and
[1:25:40] father may only the Holy Spirit and the
[1:25:43] elect Angel be in this place to anoint
[1:25:46] to bless to touch to feel to transform
[1:25:49] the life of your children and to Lord
[1:25:51] father Enlighten them by the power of
[1:25:54] the of the Revelation father we rebuke
[1:25:57] everything that is contrary to your word
[1:25:59] may you protect our homes and our
[1:26:01] properties and this church property and
[1:26:04] speak to our soul in a powerful way
[1:26:06] father in the name of Jesus Christ amen
[1:26:10] God God richly bless you my subject this
[1:26:14] morning is
[1:26:16] the four phases of Ruth
[1:26:18] the Dual fold
[1:26:21] of the silver empress
[1:26:26] the Dual fold of the silver and Brass in
[1:26:30] other words the silver
[1:26:32] have two aspects
[1:26:35] and this brass have two aspects
[1:26:38] what are they brother Stephen
[1:26:42] we are still in the threshing floor
[1:26:45] dealing with the second oil Lord help me
[1:26:48] reach there and down down down in the
[1:26:51] Tabernacle we are in the holiest
[1:26:54] amen because whatever is happening now
[1:26:57] it is connected with the coming of the
[1:27:00] Lord
[1:27:01] and to meet the Lord you must have oil
[1:27:03] in your lamp
[1:27:05] amen so the baptism of the holy spirit
[1:27:07] is connected with
[1:27:09] the fact that it makes you a candidate
[1:27:12] to meet the Lord into the air
[1:27:15] I'm going to remind you this because
[1:27:17] it's very important we will need it
[1:27:20] later on brother Branham say a prophecy
[1:27:23] sometimes has a natural meaning
[1:27:27] then he has a spiritual meaning in other
[1:27:30] words the prophecy all are all are the
[1:27:34] prophecy ever compound meeting
[1:27:37] amen so when you read Prophecy in the
[1:27:41] scripture you must be very careful
[1:27:44] amen you can catch it spiritually but
[1:27:48] you can lose it naturally or you can
[1:27:50] catch it naturally and you lose it
[1:27:52] spiritually and if you lose it
[1:27:55] spiritually something is happening in
[1:27:57] other words when a prophecy gets
[1:27:59] fulfilled you must watch what is going
[1:28:02] on naturally speaking with that prophecy
[1:28:06] and what is behind the prophecy that we
[1:28:09] cannot see with our own eyes
[1:28:11] in other words a prophecy have an unseen
[1:28:17] fulfillment and a fulfillment that is
[1:28:20] visible
[1:28:22] the visible is what you can see but the
[1:28:25] deadly one is what you cannot see which
[1:28:28] is the invisible and we walk by faith
[1:28:32] [Music]
[1:28:34] and not by water tight so whatever
[1:28:37] happened in the world you must be able
[1:28:39] to climb higher like an eagle and see
[1:28:43] what is behind it
[1:28:48] everybody okay brother Branham say any
[1:28:51] Bible reader knows that all scripture
[1:28:55] has a compound meaning
[1:28:57] every prophecy
[1:29:00] not some
[1:29:02] some most all of it
[1:29:04] has a water
[1:29:07] a time there and two times or more that
[1:29:11] it shall be water answered or fulfilled
[1:29:14] as a revolving water of history in other
[1:29:17] words when you read the Old Testament
[1:29:20] do you follow me you must see a prophecy
[1:29:23] that was prophesied
[1:29:25] anybody here and that prophecy happened
[1:29:29] in the Old Testament
[1:29:33] everybody okay but if you get caught
[1:29:36] right there you're gonna miss it
[1:29:39] the prophecy happened in the Old
[1:29:42] Testament for a reference
[1:29:47] everybody okay his brother Prana may
[1:29:50] love today
[1:29:52] have the Rapture ever happen
[1:29:54] God knew brother Branham would die
[1:29:57] before the rapture
[1:30:00] everybody okay the way brother Branham
[1:30:03] was preaching he also purple
[1:30:07] everybody okay that he would stay alive
[1:30:10] until Jesus comes
[1:30:13] everybody care if brother brother meets
[1:30:16] alive whatever prophecy happen brother
[1:30:20] Branham will stand and say you see what
[1:30:22] is happening there this is right here in
[1:30:24] the Bible you see what is happening
[1:30:26] there it is right here in the Bible but
[1:30:28] God knew that brother Branham won't be
[1:30:30] there
[1:30:32] everybody here because brother Branham
[1:30:36] die with 56 years
[1:30:40] amen right which is seven times eight
[1:30:52] am I saying something
[1:30:54] Amen brother Branham say every seven
[1:30:57] years
[1:30:58] something happened to your life
[1:31:02] everybody okay brother Branham went
[1:31:04] through seven seven
[1:31:06] and when he reached eternity seven eight
[1:31:09] God took him
[1:31:12] you're going to swallow that later
[1:31:15] everybody okay everybody okay everybody
[1:31:18] okay so when God knew that brother
[1:31:21] Branham would die before the Rapture
[1:31:24] happened
[1:31:25] amen God allow prophecy to be fulfilled
[1:31:30] when brother brother meets alive
[1:31:34] everybody okay but he was not the
[1:31:37] Rapture yet
[1:31:39] are you following me so the reason why
[1:31:41] it happened is for brother Branham to
[1:31:44] give you a Baseline
[1:31:48] to give you a reference
[1:31:52] since America started no Catholic
[1:31:55] President
[1:31:58] everybody come if not Catholic President
[1:32:01] was was risen when brother Branham was
[1:32:05] alive you could be lost today
[1:32:09] because all you see world will be
[1:32:11] another president in the power but God
[1:32:14] knew that brother Branham would die and
[1:32:17] God said no no no no I need to give
[1:32:19] these children something because
[1:32:22] prophecy repeated itself
[1:32:25] everybody okay while brother Branham is
[1:32:28] alive
[1:32:29] God open up Kennedy
[1:32:33] do you follow me so when Kennedy is
[1:32:36] coming up brother Branham sees the
[1:32:38] prophecy he look he said oh the Rapture
[1:32:40] is going to happen
[1:32:41] everybody okay then brother Branham
[1:32:44] Trace Kennedy into the scripture and
[1:32:47] said this is the first Catholic Church
[1:32:50] everybody okay and for some reason
[1:32:52] something left the lips of Radha Branham
[1:32:55] and say for sure we will have another
[1:32:58] one
[1:33:00] hey everybody okay brother Branham
[1:33:03] continue and die in 65 we never have
[1:33:07] another Catholic President
[1:33:10] everybody okay but the prophecy remain
[1:33:13] true
[1:33:14] everybody okay now brother Branham is
[1:33:17] not here
[1:33:19] brother Branham is dead brother Branham
[1:33:21] is in the sixth Dimension now another
[1:33:24] president happened again which is a
[1:33:28] Catholic President
[1:33:31] everybody here when that happened
[1:33:33] because of what already happened
[1:33:36] everybody okay now we can go back in the
[1:33:40] reading of the prophet and we can read
[1:33:43] it and come back and begin to understand
[1:33:46] what is happening today because prophecy
[1:33:50] sometimes repeats itself
[1:33:54] and you can miss the repetition while
[1:33:57] it's giving you a signal of what God is
[1:34:00] trying to do
[1:34:01] so sometimes when you read the Old
[1:34:03] Testament you must see Isaiah
[1:34:05] prophesying something
[1:34:09] and it happened in the time of Isaiah
[1:34:13] amen but if you look at the description
[1:34:16] of the prophecy the prophecy will
[1:34:19] sometimes say this prophecy is for the
[1:34:22] latter days
[1:34:24] but Isaiah was not delayed the days it
[1:34:28] is telling you that that prophecy will
[1:34:30] repeat again the second time
[1:34:34] foreign
[1:34:36] are we okay
[1:34:38] did I lose anybody
[1:34:40] glory to God
[1:34:42] where are you going brother Stephen
[1:34:44] last Sunday we took the Beast of
[1:34:48] revelation 13. we combined that Beast
[1:34:52] together with the church changes
[1:34:54] everybody okay
[1:34:55] we started first in heaven
[1:34:58] and you need this today because I could
[1:35:01] not get to this on Sunday last Sunday
[1:35:05] the Bible says that in heaven
[1:35:08] there was a great dragon
[1:35:10] having seven horns and ten horns you
[1:35:13] understand this now
[1:35:14] verse 4 this is where I want you to
[1:35:17] remember that the tale of this Dragon
[1:35:20] drew the third part of the stars of
[1:35:23] Heaven
[1:35:25] so the Dragon
[1:35:27] did something to the Stars
[1:35:31] not all the star but only a third
[1:35:35] everybody okay a third of the stars of
[1:35:38] heaven and did cast them to water Earth
[1:35:41] he cast them to the Earth
[1:35:43] or to the ground
[1:35:46] or to the Dust
[1:35:48] amen so if you see a power
[1:35:53] I know what I'm saying that
[1:35:55] is dealing with the star
[1:35:57] and taking the star and put them down
[1:36:01] onto the Earth what power is that
[1:36:06] you follow me the name might change
[1:36:10] remember that
[1:36:12] the form can change but you watch the
[1:36:15] working of the spirit watch the
[1:36:18] characteristic of that Beast he will
[1:36:20] tell you who is behind
[1:36:22] everybody here so we don't get caught up
[1:36:25] with the name we get caught with the
[1:36:28] Fulfillment of what that thing is doing
[1:36:31] if whatever happened you can call this
[1:36:35] even let me call it maybe a parrot
[1:36:40] everybody okay if I see a parrot taking
[1:36:44] the stars and putting them on the ground
[1:36:47] it is not a parrot
[1:36:49] [Music]
[1:36:51] everybody okay it is the dragon in the
[1:36:54] parrot
[1:36:56] do you follow me do you follow me so
[1:36:59] whatever will repeat something like this
[1:37:01] it tells you who it is
[1:37:04] because Jesus Christ himself is the same
[1:37:08] today and water forever if you have the
[1:37:11] Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost will not do
[1:37:13] something new
[1:37:15] you know
[1:37:17] anybody here they will continue to live
[1:37:20] the same life that the holy ghost live
[1:37:23] that's how we can tell you God the Holy
[1:37:26] Ghost you got the Holy Ghost because we
[1:37:28] are doing the same thing we have the
[1:37:30] same anointing we have the same spirit
[1:37:32] that spirit will make you behave a
[1:37:34] certain way that is in reference to the
[1:37:37] life of Jesus Christ you cannot have a
[1:37:40] holy ghost that make you behave
[1:37:42] different than Jesus Christ that is not
[1:37:44] the Holy Ghost
[1:37:45] however
[1:37:48] everybody okay your Holy Ghost must make
[1:37:51] you do the work of Christ
[1:37:55] everybody care when we see the work of
[1:37:57] Christ then we can tell which spirit is
[1:38:00] working on you when you see the work of
[1:38:02] a dragon
[1:38:04] then you can tell who is behind whatever
[1:38:07] name that you're dealing with
[1:38:09] everybody okay and the Bible said that
[1:38:12] the Great Dragon was cast out that old
[1:38:16] water called the devil and who Satan we
[1:38:20] understand this now now the way we
[1:38:22] connected this we found that in pergamos
[1:38:25] I'm just reviewing so I take off in
[1:38:28] pilgrims we got the certain seat
[1:38:31] and the dragon gave to this Beast here
[1:38:34] the seat of himself so the seat and the
[1:38:38] seat matches together amen and the first
[1:38:41] seal that started in Ephesus was crying
[1:38:44] already
[1:38:46] everybody okay and he was crying into a
[1:38:48] man called the first prophet which was
[1:38:50] the pope
[1:38:52] you remember that then the next age was
[1:38:56] that Italian churches then a woman came
[1:38:58] back there by the name of Jezebel which
[1:39:01] called herself a prophetess now we have
[1:39:05] a prophet plus a prophetess
[1:39:09] we have a prophet
[1:39:11] amen plus a prophetess
[1:39:16] amen this Prophet received the Dragon
[1:39:20] which is the old serpent
[1:39:22] amen
[1:39:24] plus a woman
[1:39:27] which is Jezebel
[1:39:29] amen the combination of these two
[1:39:34] join us to revelation 17.
[1:39:38] where we saw now the woman
[1:39:40] that is sitting upon us
[1:39:43] and that Beast have seven horns and ten
[1:39:46] seven heads and ten horn everybody okay
[1:39:50] so when that Beast and the woman join
[1:39:53] together in Revelation 17 if he opened
[1:39:57] up the seven uh the second seal
[1:40:00] when the second seal was open the woman
[1:40:03] begin to kill we saw it last Sunday she
[1:40:06] killed so much
[1:40:08] until she was drunk with the blood of
[1:40:11] descent amen and because of her killing
[1:40:14] the church fled from Europe
[1:40:18] amen because a new land was discovered
[1:40:21] America the main flower made a day and
[1:40:26] then in the edge of Philadelphia the
[1:40:28] independence of United States happened
[1:40:30] then America rose again as a beautiful
[1:40:33] power that loves God and everything
[1:40:37] but according to prophecy this power
[1:40:40] will speak like a dragon
[1:40:43] everybody okay but the dragon was the
[1:40:47] devil
[1:40:48] who was Satan who was the old Serpent
[1:40:52] and that Dragon already incarnated into
[1:40:55] Rome
[1:40:57] by now we found out that the dragon is
[1:40:59] also in America
[1:41:01] how did the dragon get to America how
[1:41:05] did this dragon how did Satan get to
[1:41:08] Adam
[1:41:10] Satan got to Adam
[1:41:13] first by getting into the serpent
[1:41:17] everybody okay Dead from the serpent to
[1:41:20] the woman
[1:41:21] everybody care then the woman came and
[1:41:24] began to teach
[1:41:26] fornication to Adam
[1:41:29] everybody okay how did the Beast get to
[1:41:33] America
[1:41:34] the beast from Heaven the dragon who is
[1:41:38] Satan amen got him to the Beast
[1:41:41] everybody okay the beasts of Rome
[1:41:45] everybody okay and the beasts are from
[1:41:48] use a Woman by the name of Jezebel
[1:41:51] amen and Jezebel got into America
[1:41:57] everybody okay from Satan in heaven into
[1:42:01] the serpent from the serpent into the
[1:42:04] woman from the woman into Adam and teach
[1:42:07] Adam to commit fornication
[1:42:09] everybody okay from the dragon into the
[1:42:12] beast from the Beast into the woman the
[1:42:14] two combined together and the woman into
[1:42:17] the America which brother Branham said I
[1:42:19] see the Catholic Church I see the
[1:42:22] Catholic Church which is a woman
[1:42:25] everybody okay so far did I lose anybody
[1:42:28] glory to God now we can see now there is
[1:42:32] a connection between the two here
[1:42:34] and when that connection happened God's
[1:42:37] soul
[1:42:39] that he will avenge the blood of his
[1:42:41] scent
[1:42:42] he will come and burn
[1:42:45] but the whole is not only in Rome
[1:42:52] by prophecy made it to the United States
[1:42:56] because we found out in United States
[1:42:59] that there was a woman wearing purple
[1:43:01] and this woman also was wearing purple
[1:43:08] you know that
[1:43:09] or you don't know it
[1:43:11] who doesn't know it
[1:43:13] okay glory to God this woman also was
[1:43:16] wearing paper and then it was combined
[1:43:19] with the second Catholic President
[1:43:21] confirming to us in the spiritual
[1:43:23] background that the woman
[1:43:26] amen the Catholic church is now in the
[1:43:30] United States
[1:43:31] everybody okay so if God wants to burn
[1:43:35] everybody okay the woman he cannot Burn
[1:43:39] only Rome
[1:43:42] everybody okay because the woman is buff
[1:43:45] in Rome and also in United States
[1:43:49] amen because according to the
[1:43:51] judgmentary the Bible says and this
[1:43:54] woman if you remember the Bible call her
[1:43:57] mystery Babylon
[1:44:01] mystery Babylon amen Babylon the water
[1:44:05] the great in other words Babylon even
[1:44:08] though naturally was destroyed Babylon
[1:44:11] is still under existence
[1:44:13] now in Jeremiah the Bible said I will
[1:44:16] Render unto Babylon and to all in our
[1:44:20] inhabitants of Calvin all the evil that
[1:44:23] they have done in Zion
[1:44:25] if you look in the time of Jeremiah
[1:44:28] Jeremiah was in the time of captivity
[1:44:32] everybody okay and it looks like
[1:44:34] Jeremiah was talking about the Revenge
[1:44:38] of God in Babylon at that time
[1:44:43] everybody okay which path really
[1:44:45] happened
[1:44:47] God destroyed Babylon but we found out
[1:44:50] that the burning of Babylon that
[1:44:53] Jeremiah said here is also spoken in the
[1:44:56] Book of Revelation
[1:44:58] because prophecy has a compound meaning
[1:45:02] prophecy repeated itself
[1:45:06] everybody okay
[1:45:08] everybody okay
[1:45:10] because what because Babylon of the Old
[1:45:13] Testament was the natural part
[1:45:16] but what was on the Babylon was a spirit
[1:45:19] you can destroy the vessel but the
[1:45:22] spirit of Babylon is there so we got a
[1:45:25] chance that Spirit until God destroys it
[1:45:27] everybody okay so far
[1:45:30] the Bible says this in the book uh in in
[1:45:33] the mark of the beast body Brahm say
[1:45:34] this he said you are coming into the
[1:45:37] power of communism
[1:45:41] make her desolated naked and shall eat
[1:45:45] her flesh and burn her with water why
[1:45:48] because God put in the heart
[1:45:54] the heart of the people that hate him
[1:46:00] everybody okay God put in the heart to
[1:46:04] fulfill his will and to agree and to
[1:46:07] give their Kingdom unto the water peace
[1:46:10] until the words of God be what fulfilled
[1:46:13] so the destruction of the Beast
[1:46:16] is coming by communism
[1:46:22] will be all right buddy but if Adam says
[1:46:25] that these 10 horses are horns these
[1:46:29] tenth Kingdom what are they he said they
[1:46:32] are dictator watch the way dictator
[1:46:35] leads to where is he leaning to just
[1:46:38] tell me a dictator that doesn't lean
[1:46:40] toward water communism that is dictator
[1:46:43] you see of course these have water now
[1:46:47] look here and they talk about water
[1:46:50] communism brother Brown I'm clearly
[1:46:52] defined to us that the destruction of
[1:46:55] the woman is coming with Communism she
[1:46:59] will head the woman and burn her amen
[1:47:01] because the woman is the agent Satan is
[1:47:04] using to make everybody in the world
[1:47:07] drank with the wine of her fornication
[1:47:10] the entire world everybody okay amen
[1:47:14] everybody okay the serpent doesn't have
[1:47:17] to work anymore the serpent work on Eve
[1:47:20] and left Eve
[1:47:22] hey everybody okay he was Eve who was
[1:47:25] responsible to continue the destruction
[1:47:28] everybody care so when the first prophet
[1:47:30] combined with the woman amen and the
[1:47:34] woman is polluted everybody okay the
[1:47:37] first prophet stayed quiet in Rome and
[1:47:41] the woman the churches
[1:47:43] they opened the churches everywhere amen
[1:47:48] and the Catholic Church being everywhere
[1:47:50] in the world that is the church that is
[1:47:54] polluting everywhere it's going but the
[1:47:57] Beast itself might not be in your
[1:47:59] country he doesn't have to be in your
[1:48:01] country the woman does the dirty job for
[1:48:04] him
[1:48:06] foreign
[1:48:08] so God Must Destroy the woman and to
[1:48:12] destroy the woman he's using the power
[1:48:15] of Communism in order to burn that woman
[1:48:20] everybody okay everybody okay so if we
[1:48:24] are dealing with Babylon as a woman
[1:48:28] amen Babylon mystery Babylon the great
[1:48:32] which is a what a woman
[1:48:35] amen if this woman is Babylon god
[1:48:39] brother Branham say before he uses
[1:48:42] something
[1:48:44] you follow me God doesn't use weapon
[1:48:47] just like that
[1:48:49] everybody okay God looks through times
[1:48:53] because his knowledge make him
[1:48:56] omnipresent
[1:48:58] we went through that when we say that
[1:49:00] God is omnipresent it doesn't mean God
[1:49:03] is everywhere like the air we already
[1:49:05] explained you that it is the knowledge
[1:49:07] of God that makes God omnipresent and
[1:49:11] that knowledge give even God the power
[1:49:14] to be prophetic because God knows
[1:49:17] everything since he knows everything he
[1:49:20] can prophesy he's prophesying because he
[1:49:23] already know everything he knows you're
[1:49:25] dead a breath all the way till you die
[1:49:28] if he knows everything God can come and
[1:49:31] say in 2014 this and this will happen to
[1:49:34] you and it's going to happen the reason
[1:49:36] why God can prophesy is because God
[1:49:39] knows already everything
[1:49:42] amen the prophecy is a chunk of his
[1:49:45] knowledge
[1:49:47] do you follow me that he brings it out
[1:49:50] and tell you before it happened but he
[1:49:53] already knows that everybody okay so far
[1:49:56] anyway okay so far so God when he sees
[1:50:00] everything he already know everything so
[1:50:02] before he uses a weapon
[1:50:04] do you follow me
[1:50:06] amen God must make sure that that weapon
[1:50:10] will remain true in eternity
[1:50:16] everybody okay that's why brother
[1:50:18] Branham say if you approach God
[1:50:21] and you ask God for something
[1:50:24] and God gave it to you that's hey it
[1:50:28] means everybody
[1:50:30] that will approach God under the same
[1:50:34] ground that you did must receive the
[1:50:38] same result all the time that's what
[1:50:41] made Jesus Christ the same
[1:50:44] today and what because if we already
[1:50:48] started something he will continue all
[1:50:51] the time with it
[1:50:54] everybody okay
[1:50:56] so to destroy the kingdom of Babylon
[1:51:00] when Daniel was rejected you remember
[1:51:04] God used the bear
[1:51:08] everybody okay
[1:51:11] to destroy Babylon God used the power of
[1:51:15] the bear
[1:51:16] everybody care when God searched the
[1:51:20] Beast
[1:51:21] he looked at the leopard he said the
[1:51:24] leopard cannot match Babylon
[1:51:26] you look at this one he said not this
[1:51:28] one he pick up the bear
[1:51:31] amen and he said the bear you're gonna
[1:51:33] destroy Babylon once God destroyed
[1:51:36] Babylon with the bear
[1:51:39] everybody okay
[1:51:40] everybody okay it is sealed eternally
[1:51:45] are we okay if God wanted to destroy
[1:51:48] Babylon again
[1:51:51] he doesn't have to think twice
[1:51:57] everybody okay he just go back again and
[1:52:00] use the same weapon he uses again amen
[1:52:03] and Destroy Babylon
[1:52:06] they bear on that time might be a little
[1:52:10] bit different in form
[1:52:12] and name and aspect by the spirit will
[1:52:17] remain the same
[1:52:18] everybody okay so far everybody okay so
[1:52:21] far glory to God so the bear today we
[1:52:26] find that there is a country today
[1:52:29] hey everybody here that country is
[1:52:32] called Russia
[1:52:35] everybody okay NDM blame of this country
[1:52:39] the animal power of this country Isabel
[1:52:45] amen why is this country calling itself
[1:52:49] the bear
[1:52:54] everybody care everybody care if you
[1:52:57] look naturally the middle pigeon are on
[1:53:02] the side of Aaron
[1:53:05] everybody here so if you chase the belt
[1:53:08] there you're not gonna get them
[1:53:10] you follow me the bear is not there
[1:53:13] today he was the bear on that time but
[1:53:16] because prophecy repeat itself
[1:53:19] everybody okay everybody okay that
[1:53:22] spirit will move into somebody and begin
[1:53:25] to attack Babylon and Destroy Babylon
[1:53:28] again today
[1:53:29] everybody okay so far now as we're
[1:53:32] leading with the bear
[1:53:33] follow me carefully now put your seat
[1:53:36] belt the Bear in Daniel 2 was simple as
[1:53:41] as The Silver Kingdom
[1:53:45] everybody okay
[1:53:47] because Daniel was the kingdom and then
[1:53:50] Daniel 7 Daniel 2 was the kingdom and
[1:53:52] then your seven was the power behind the
[1:53:54] kingdom anybody okay in danger too when
[1:53:58] you look at the one who destroyed
[1:54:00] Babylon it was the middle pigeon follow
[1:54:03] me carefully anybody okay the middle
[1:54:06] pigeon that was the kingdom but behind
[1:54:09] it was a bear
[1:54:11] everybody okay and let me remind you
[1:54:14] that all these beasts here are not
[1:54:17] domestic animals
[1:54:22] brother Branham says this
[1:54:24] revelation 11. Revelation 13 Revelation
[1:54:28] 17 they were beasts there were beasties
[1:54:32] the chapters in Revelation 11 13 and 17
[1:54:36] is called water
[1:54:38] the same way but the Beast there
[1:54:42] interpretation is fairion
[1:54:45] very on the word Greek period which
[1:54:48] means water and water until Beast
[1:54:54] can I raise some of them
[1:54:57] the twofold
[1:54:59] they do or fold
[1:55:01] of the bear
[1:55:03] of the silver
[1:55:05] and the brass
[1:55:07] amen the silver is the middle Persian
[1:55:11] Kingdom anybody okay
[1:55:13] the power behind that kingdom is a bear
[1:55:16] but we found out that all the power are
[1:55:19] wild
[1:55:21] amen they are Savage
[1:55:25] amen they are Untamed
[1:55:29] amen
[1:55:30] to get them into the zoo you will
[1:55:32] struggle
[1:55:33] you have to eat them shoot them put them
[1:55:36] to sleep and put them up and put them in
[1:55:38] the zoo because if we wake up before you
[1:55:41] get to the zoo you are done everybody
[1:55:43] okay everybody okay brother Branham said
[1:55:46] they are wild
[1:55:47] they are 10 they are Savage they're
[1:55:50] supposed to be living in the bush of
[1:55:53] forest in the world area over there
[1:55:56] terion means what the world and term
[1:55:59] beast but the beasts of the four living
[1:56:02] room

[1:56:17] so if the middle pigeon their animal was
[1:56:22] a bear
[1:56:23] amen so this power also is world
[1:56:29] I'm going slowly it is a Savage power
[1:56:33] [Music]
[1:56:35] and it is a power that you can attain
[1:56:39] that's the power that they use to handle
[1:56:42] Babylon
[1:56:43] everybody okay
[1:56:44] where are you going as we're dealing
[1:56:46] with despair
[1:56:48] you okay now
[1:56:50] despair according to Daniel 7 and Daniel
[1:56:55] 2 he speak about the kingdom of the
[1:56:58] middle Persian Empire
[1:57:00] and this is the kingdom God used to
[1:57:03] destroy Babylon
[1:57:04] everybody okay but today the bear is
[1:57:09] represented by the country of Russia
[1:57:14] everybody okay why brother Stephen have
[1:57:18] we have to deal with this Kingdom and
[1:57:21] Russia Today
[1:57:24] what is going on between the bear and
[1:57:27] Russia
[1:57:29] brother Branham say Spirit doesn't die
[1:57:36] we okay
[1:57:38] man die but Spirit does not die God take
[1:57:43] his man
[1:57:45] but never his Spirit God took Elijah and
[1:57:49] the double portion of his Spirit Came
[1:57:50] Upon Elisha about a hundred years later
[1:57:54] came out on John the Baptist and
[1:57:56] predicted to come when once again again
[1:58:00] where
[1:58:01] in the last day God took Christ out of
[1:58:04] the Earth but the Holy Spirit Come Back
[1:58:07] the devil take his man
[1:58:11] everybody okay but the spirit remains
[1:58:14] just the water so if the spirit were
[1:58:17] satanic spirit
[1:58:19] and this Spirit operated in the Kingdom
[1:58:22] of middles and Persian even though those
[1:58:25] Kingdom were destroyed the spirit was
[1:58:28] still available
[1:58:33] let's go to Isaiah 13.
[1:58:36] then
[1:58:38] I'm good in time for those who worry
[1:58:44] Isaiah 13 verse 1.
[1:58:48] you make sure you have a Bible
[1:58:53] because you need it
[1:58:55] why are we studying the spirit what is
[1:58:58] important about the spirit
[1:59:00] amen
[1:59:02] amen the form can change
[1:59:05] the name match and you remember that
[1:59:07] quote by the working of the spirit will
[1:59:09] remain the same
[1:59:11] if you chase the middle prison by Aaron
[1:59:14] Iran is causing trouble too
[1:59:17] but not at the level of the other bear
[1:59:22] and I ran if you chase the animal it's
[1:59:25] not a bear
[1:59:27] the national animal is
[1:59:31] everybody okay but we found the country
[1:59:33] for some reason they look at the
[1:59:36] continent they say we have a grizzly
[1:59:37] bear here we have a primary in Asia we
[1:59:41] call ourselves the bear
[1:59:45] I haven't
[1:59:46] you can chase the woman in Europe you
[1:59:50] will find her she's also in America
[1:59:52] if you stuck in Rome you will miss her
[1:59:55] in America
[1:59:56] if you stuck in Iran you can miss the
[1:59:59] Bear in Russia everybody okay
[2:00:02] Isaiah 13. let's go now first one
[2:00:06] remember prophecy does what revolve
[2:00:10] the burden of who
[2:00:13] which Isaiah the son of Amos did see
[2:00:17] Isaiah
[2:00:19] God bring a message for Babylon
[2:00:22] amen what Isaiah Isaiah what are you
[2:00:26] talking about Babylon we need to know
[2:00:28] what is going on with Babylon what is
[2:00:30] God saying
[2:00:32] job to verse 9.
[2:00:35] behold the day of the Lord
[2:00:38] come
[2:00:39] how oh
[2:00:42] does this look like the time of Isaiah
[2:00:48] does it look like the time of Isaiah
[2:00:51] you gotta know how prophecy work
[2:00:54] beyond the day come
[2:00:56] the day is gonna be cruel
[2:00:59] buff with rough
[2:01:01] and feast and anger
[2:01:05] Jesus Christ was God
[2:01:08] and Jesus was God who came down from
[2:01:11] heaven
[2:01:12] when Jesus came did you see him cool no
[2:01:16] did you see the day of Jesus being cruel
[2:01:19] and then feel Sanger matter of fact
[2:01:21] Jesus brought Mercy he brought Grace but
[2:01:25] this coming of the Lord is not with
[2:01:28] Mercy everybody okay this the coming of
[2:01:32] the Lord of Jesus Christ according to
[2:01:34] Isaiah was a virgin shall prophesy
[2:01:36] that's what fulfilled but this one when
[2:01:39] the Lord cometh the Lord is not happy
[2:01:42] the Lord is not laughing the Lord is
[2:01:45] angry
[2:01:48] by the anger of the Lord is in the last
[2:01:51] day
[2:01:52] why is he angry somebody is drunk with
[2:01:55] the blood of his sentence we understand
[2:01:57] now follow me carefully
[2:02:00] if you can restrict the movement that
[2:02:02] would be great
[2:02:03] behold the day of the Lord come crew
[2:02:07] buff with wrath and fierce anger to lay
[2:02:11] the land desolate
[2:02:13] and he shall destroy the water
[2:02:16] stop when Jesus Christ came he did he
[2:02:19] destroy the sinner Jesus came to do what
[2:02:21] to serve the sinner but this is no more
[2:02:24] saving
[2:02:25] Grace is over so you got to know how
[2:02:28] you're looking at prophecy
[2:02:30] everybody okay
[2:02:32] to destroy the Sinners amen
[2:02:35] there thereof out of it verse 10 for the
[2:02:40] water doors the stars of Heaven and the
[2:02:44] constellation thereof shall not give the
[2:02:47] water light what is he talking about
[2:02:49] tribulation
[2:02:52] because in the sixth Hill when they open
[2:02:56] the whole Earth the Sun and the Moon
[2:02:58] everything was darkened this is not the
[2:03:01] time of Isaiah
[2:03:02] you understand now you need to know how
[2:03:04] prophecy revolve
[2:03:06] the day
[2:03:08] the Bible says the light the stars of
[2:03:11] Heaven verse 10 and the constellation
[2:03:13] thereof shall not give the light the sun
[2:03:16] shall be what darkened dark and in its
[2:03:18] going forth and the moon shall not cause
[2:03:22] her light to shine everybody okay
[2:03:25] verse 11 and I will punish the water
[2:03:29] world for the water evil did Jesus
[2:03:32] punish the world he came and shed his
[2:03:35] blood to save the world
[2:03:37] everybody okay but this time he's
[2:03:39] punishing the world
[2:03:41] I will punish the world everybody okay
[2:03:43] with evil uh for their evil and the
[2:03:47] wicked for their iniquity and I will
[2:03:49] cause the arrogancy of the pride to
[2:03:52] seize I will lay low the haughtiness of
[2:03:57] the water everybody okay
[2:03:59] drop to verse 15. now we understand
[2:04:02] which burden I say ahead in other words
[2:04:05] Isaiah had the burden for Babylon but
[2:04:08] not the Babylon of his time because at
[2:04:11] the end time there is Mystery Babylon so
[2:04:14] Isaiah begin to prophesy about the
[2:04:17] Babylon of the end time we okay now jump
[2:04:20] to verse 15.
[2:04:22] everyone that is found shall be trust
