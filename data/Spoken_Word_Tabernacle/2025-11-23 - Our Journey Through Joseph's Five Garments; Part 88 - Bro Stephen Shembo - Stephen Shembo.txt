========================================
to be a servant of God. Billy Graham, we have the statement brother there has IT WHEN IT WAS ASKED BILLY GRAHAM BY CERTAIN WHO WHAT WAS THIS GREAT contradiction about THE TRINITY WAS THERE THREE GODS THREE ACTUAL GODS OR HOW WAS IT ONE PLACE LOOK LIKE THREE GODS AND ONE LOOKED LIKE THIS BILLY GRIM SAID IT HASN'T BEEN revealed nobody knows My &gt;&gt; IF THERE IS THREE GODS, WE ARE HEATHENS. &gt;&gt; LIKE THE JEWS SAID, "WHICH ONE OF THEM IS YOUR GOD? The Father? Is the Son your God? Or is the Holy Ghost your God?" There's only one God. AND THOSE ARE NOT THREE PERSONALITIES. FOR A PERSONALITY HAS TO BE A PERSON. There can't be A PERSONALITY WITHOUT BEING A PERSON. You know that. How can anything be a personality without BEING A PERSON? OH, SAID WE DON'T BELIEVE IN THREE personal gods. We believe in three personalities of the same God. Well, before it can be a personality, IT HAS TO BE A PERSON. What is it then? You'd say it's NOT THREE GODS. IT'S THREE offices of the same God. &gt;&gt; Amen. He was the father in the beginning that hung over the the wilderness in in the flame of fire, the burning bush. FATHERHOOD, GOD JUST AS IT GOT THROUGH SIN CONDENSED COMING DOWN. THAT WAS THE HIGHEST ORDER, the spirit, the the the goth, THE ZOEY, THE THE LIFE OF GOD HIMSELF MADE IN A FORM OF A PILLAR of fire. AND THAT SAME [screaming] ONE AFTER BEING IN THE fatherhood became the son and the spirit OF THE WAS IN THE BURNING BUSH WAS IN THE MAN CHRIST. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND IT BROUGHT FORTH THE SAME EVIDENCE THAT THE FIRE did said if I do not the works of MY FATHER DON'T BELIEVE ME. Every tree will bear record of its own fruit. And then actually become man, SEE IT DROP DOWN FROM supernatural into something tangible that could be touched, a body. AND THROUGH THE SACRIFICIAL DEATH AND THE SUPREME SACRIFICE OF THIS ONE God Jesus, HE SAID, I AND MY father are one. &gt;&gt; My father dwelleth in me. Can and no one could read that any planer. THEY SAID, "WHY DON'T YOU SHOW US THE father and it'll it'll satisfy us?" John 14:8. He said, "I've been so long with you, you don't know me." He said, "When you see the f when you see me, you see my father." As a lady once jumped up, she said, "WELL, BROTHER BRANDON, SHE SAID, you the father and the son are one, just like you and your wife are one." I said, "Oh, no, they're not." I said, "Do you see me?" She said, "Yes." I said, "You see my wife?" Said, "No." I said, "Then they're not the same kind of one." Jesus said, "When you seen me, you have seen the father."

We have 18K remaining. So congratulation. We're moving from 67 all the way to 80. [cheering] [applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. So I still have to clear that one and then get in the next bill for the people that frame over there and pay them and keep moving. So, we catching up, but I'm moving by faith. &gt;&gt; So, hop on with me and let's can continue do the best that we can. By God's grace, everything will be well. The way we're moving, it's a miracle. The way this church operate, it's a miracle. Where the money is coming from, it's a miracle. The strength we have, it's a miracle. So, spoken word from the beginning all the way to eternity, it will always be a miracle. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. This is a lot of sacrifice because this is squeezing us to the end. If I show you our bank account, you will be like, how how do you even work with this? That's the way I work. Amen. &gt;&gt; So everything that is entering, we got holes somewhere. We are kind of patching some hole. So continue praying, continue to do what you got to do. Before you know it, you will have your fellowship hall and everything clear. We clear there? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Everybody happy? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; You have a problem with finances again? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you have a problem with finances in this church? After last sermon, sir, &gt;&gt; after last sermon, &gt;&gt; the problem is not those who have riches. &gt;&gt; The problem is those who trust &gt;&gt; in their riches. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So now you have opened up your mind &gt;&gt; to receive the blessing of God. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Because you were afraid to even ask God for something. &gt;&gt; Uh-huh. Amen. &gt;&gt; Until they squeeze you on the bills &gt;&gt; and then you come back crying. You say, "Lord, I don't know why I'm going through trial." &gt;&gt; Go ask your father. You say, "Give me money. &gt;&gt; Give me money so I can pay my bills." &gt;&gt; Is that a problem? [screaming] &gt;&gt; The Bible say, "Give your offering and your tithing and God will do what?" Open up the water &gt;&gt; and pour what water &gt;&gt; pour blessing until you have room to put them. &gt;&gt; But you still have room &gt;&gt; and you are comfortable. &gt;&gt; Because you spiritual because you're spiritual. &gt;&gt; Don't worry. Some of you will be regretting when we go into the rapture. You'll be like, "Ah, I wish I knew." [laughter] That's why the Holy Spirit is unfolding that to you so you know your benefit because he died for it. David even say, "Forget not." &gt;&gt; So there is a potential to forget. &gt;&gt; Forget not. Brother Brandham spoke about a parable of the mother who had checks. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; And the mother was living poor. &gt;&gt; Why did brother Brandham put that in the message? Why did he came in the message? &gt;&gt; Beautiful pictures. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And she thought he was beautiful pictures. &gt;&gt; Just like you looking at the Bible, you think it's a beautiful book. &gt;&gt; It's not a beautiful book. It got power in it. &gt;&gt; There is power in the Bible. There is power in the promises of God &gt;&gt; to take care of your trouble. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The woman was suffering &gt;&gt; with a good relationship with her son. didn't know the son was already according to the son I'm taking care of my mother &gt;&gt; but according to the mother this son goes there he sent me beautiful picture so whose fault is it &gt;&gt; so whose fault is it &gt;&gt; god or us &gt;&gt; so don't blame me to god &gt;&gt; and don't use your covering of I'm going through trial as I'm going through trial this is the trial this is the burden this is the cross how many crosses you've been carrying You also need a sermon of siren. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Even Jesus. Ah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. Let's go to our sermon. When you start like this, I need to go. Do you know that they helped Jesus on the cross? &gt;&gt; He was God. Almighty God, all powerful God. Why did they help God? &gt;&gt; You having hard time? I now understand why the Holy Spirit want me to go back a little bit on what I spoke last Sunday so we can uh burn the last the remaining of the whoever was lingering let's just remove it completely from spoken word. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; My people suffer from lack of knowledge. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham keeps saying we are living below our privileges. Below our privileges. All we know about below our privileges is spiritual. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; But we are natural people. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We get used to mediocrity for a long time until we call this my sickness. &gt;&gt; And then we push the blessing. We say no. When the rapture will come, everything will be changed. &gt;&gt; I will not. &gt;&gt; Will you need healing in the rapture? Amen. &gt;&gt; What are you going to do with strength in the rapture? You got to glorify body. [applause] &gt;&gt; Okay. If you having a hard time flat attendant, let's prepare for take off. Let's go to the reading of our scripture. &gt;&gt; It's a really strong noise, sister Roof. I don't know where it's coming from, but I know it's the devil. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. &gt;&gt; Let's pray. Heavenly Father, Lord, we are approaching you again humbly this morning. Father, thanking you for your grace, your love, your mercy, and for everything you have been doing for us. Father, this is as far as I can go with the ability you have given me. But when it comes to speaking to your bride, he only takes the supernatural action of the Holy Spirit. Father, may you move me completely out and the audience completely out. May you remove any attack from the world of darkness. Any spirit that is trying to hinder the service. Father, we rebuke it away from this place. May you protect us. Bless your word. Bless this audience visible and invisible in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; My subject this morning is our life journey through Joseph 5 garment part 88. &gt;&gt; Let's go to 1 Chronicle chapter 12. Part 88. 88. Eternity. Eternity. How did you make it to 88? Sermon. My theme if we can get that is season. Hopefully if we can get this today we will try to begin to maneuver toward the surface and get to part of our house then we can change the government. Season of opportunity for a better or a worst future. for a better or worse future. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God cannot send his word and joking. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Did you hear the testimony of Sister Miriam? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. I didn't hear you clap loud &gt;&gt; because I know how she suffered like two, three years &gt;&gt; to get this house and it's not working. It's not working and only now. Why did he came only now? &gt;&gt; Because it's the season. &gt;&gt; She got 88k. 88. Today it's 88. She said Miriam was 88. Majority were working. $88,000 given to her &gt;&gt; for $0. &gt;&gt; $88. [applause] &gt;&gt; Some of you are still spinning. &gt;&gt; When I tell you God can give you anything, you still struggling in your mind. 88. &gt;&gt; You don't remember how the Bible says that he give to the sinner the power to work and to give to the one who's rich. You don't remember all those scripture. &gt;&gt; 88k. Today it's 88 &gt;&gt; 88 $88,000 given toward the down payment and the closing cost. And she didn't pay a penny. I told her, I said, "Sister, get your down payment and go buy some furniture and fill your house." &gt;&gt; 88. &gt;&gt; I'm trying to help you remove that blockage in your mind. &gt;&gt; Too much reasoning. Too much thinking &gt;&gt; too much remove that nothing is impossible to God. &gt;&gt; If you think I'm preaching a prosperity, it's in the message &gt;&gt; and you will be shocked even today. &gt;&gt; You who are spiritual. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. and stay there that yourself. Let's go to 1 Chronicle 12:32. Amen. &gt;&gt; Sometime you talk to message believer, they act like they are in another world. &gt;&gt; In another world, &gt;&gt; like they don't even eat. &gt;&gt; They don't even eat. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham say true fellowship is around what? &gt;&gt; Around what? &gt;&gt; Did he say you don't know that quote? Yes. &gt;&gt; Was it spiritual food? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; It was water type of food. &gt;&gt; Do you see how you acting? &gt;&gt; So when we come to your house, put food. &gt;&gt; And then let's begin to talk about the word &gt;&gt; because men shall not live by bread alone, but by every let's have both. &gt;&gt; The brother is stopping in your house. He's already tired and hungry. Give him some food. &gt;&gt; You keep going. THE SEVEN SEAL WAS OPEN. HEY, GIVE SOME FOOD CALLED DOOR DASH. &gt;&gt; AND THEN LET'S CONTINUE WITH THE SEVEN SEAL. &gt;&gt; AH, get on the seven seal with food &gt;&gt; message believe. What's wrong? BE NORMAL. &gt;&gt; We have a wonderful fellowship. We have a Come on. &gt;&gt; Uh don't worry. We will continue to work with you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Until you are a man of like passion. &gt;&gt; But when you pray, &gt;&gt; God shut the heaven. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. [laughter] &gt;&gt; 1 Chronicle 12:32. You know this scripture. If you there, you can say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, my brother. And the children of what? &gt;&gt; It's a car. which were men that had understanding of time. You might be seated. The children of Issach, you already know this clearly. &gt;&gt; They were men that have understanding of what &gt;&gt; the times &gt;&gt; of times correctly of season and what &gt;&gt; to know what Israel ought to do. &gt;&gt; And they knew what to do. Amen. So number one, you must discern the time or discern the season. Are we together? &gt;&gt; And after discerning the season, you need to know what to do &gt;&gt; in that season. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because if you just discern the season, what does he mean? &gt;&gt; That's why some of you are still calm. You have not make some move yet. &gt;&gt; Amen. You didn't see the water that is trouble. [laughter] When the angel is troubling the water, it doesn't mean you sitting THERE YOU SAY, "WOW, [screaming] LOOK AT THAT WATER that is troubling." No, indeed you need to jump in the water. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So the wisdom of Isaka, you need to know to understand to discern the season and know WHAT TO DO IN THAT SEASON. &gt;&gt; AMEN. Because if YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT to do in that season, YOU WILL MISS THE SEASON. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; If you know that it's harvest and you don't know what to do, you will miss everything that you need to gather in the harvest. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, you need to know the season and know what to do. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If we will get there, I put another one, a question mark right there. We will find something there. The Bible say and know what to do that the heads of them were what? 200 &gt;&gt; and all the brethren were what? &gt;&gt; At their commandment. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Let's go to Proverbs 6 again. You're moving quickly with the scripture today. You're doing very good. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Amen. &gt;&gt; If you there, you can say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Proverbs 6 verse 6. Somebody got it already. &gt;&gt; The Bible say go to who? &gt;&gt; The end. &gt;&gt; If you don't if you miss what God is saying in this church, that is your problem. Go to who? &gt;&gt; The end. Feeble people. But they got a wisdom of God right there. &gt;&gt; Amen. He said go to the end. So God put his wisdom in the end. That's why the ant operate the way they operate. It's a divine wisdom. The Bible say go to the ant you who &gt;&gt; slugger. &gt;&gt; So they're talking about a lazy person, a sloful lazy which is the anointing in Laisha. &gt;&gt; You lazy, you slagger and consider its ways and be water. &gt;&gt; In other words, go copy. &gt;&gt; Go to the ant, observe what the ant is doing and do what the ant is doing. Learn the wisdom of the ant. Not just to learn it, but put it into work. Put it into action. Apply the wisdom that you are learning from the ant. &gt;&gt; Because the ant is successful. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Bible says, "And go to the ant you slagger. Consider its ways and be wise." Which have what? &gt;&gt; No guide &gt;&gt; or what? &gt;&gt; Overseer &gt;&gt; or what? &gt;&gt; Ruler. So the ant have nobody to supervise them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; No supervision. In other words, there's no boss. Amen. &gt;&gt; So they were normally prone to do whatever they want to do. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Because nobody's there to ask you for some accountability. &gt;&gt; So no one, it's my own work. I come to work whenever I want. I go to work whenever I want. If I don't want to go to work, I just &gt;&gt; call in. I don't go to work because nobody's caring. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; But that's not with the eight. &gt;&gt; The Bible says that no guide, no overseer or ruler, verse eight, provide her meat when &gt;&gt; in the summer &gt;&gt; and gather her food when &gt;&gt; in the harvest. &gt;&gt; We found out that the ant uses summer and fall. summer and fall. Not only to leave. Amen. &gt;&gt; Not only to leave but to store, to save &gt;&gt; or to lay in. Amen. &gt;&gt; So when this season comes, the end number one understand the season. Number two, not only understand or discern the season they get into. They know what to do that this is the only opportunity they can prevent the disaster in the future because winter is coming down the road. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I read this a lot and I'm going to read this again because there is a purpose if we can get to where we going. BROTHER BRANDHAM SAYS sometime we find oursel prone to do what? &gt;&gt; Run from work. &gt;&gt; We don't want to we don't want to work. Some people just think they can make their living water &gt;&gt; without working. &gt;&gt; But I think Solomon it was that said we could find here the answer in watching water. &gt;&gt; So the answer of not of working is in the end. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In other word an ant is a true worker. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So ant are workers. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Because they send the lazy men &gt;&gt; Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; to go to the ant. &gt;&gt; Uh-huh. to go to those that are working. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And not just working, but they're working with objective. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They're working with a plan. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; They're working knowing what they're doing. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THEY'RE WORKING TARGETING SOMETHING. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; They're working WITH A FORESIGHT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THEY'RE NOT JUST GOING TO WORK AND GET A PAYCHECK and that's it. &gt;&gt; No, they are working with plan. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; THEY ARE WORKING FOR THEIR FUTURE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. THEY ARE WORKING FOR THEIR OWN COMING SEASON. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THEY WANT TO MAKE THEIR FUTURE EASIER AND BETTER. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we clear together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham continue. He says, you know, a little ant they tell me that if any every ant does not work work and laying that that ant does not eat that winter either. So everybody got to do what? &gt;&gt; Work. So the ant not only is a worker but it's a disciplined creature. &gt;&gt; If you don't eat, they don't give you food. If you don't work, I'm sorry, they don't give you food. &gt;&gt; So you can come with all your religious stuff. The ant will say no. &gt;&gt; [laughter] &gt;&gt; You can come everywhere you want to. You say, "Brother, you see what is going on?" And the end say, "No, brother. I don't have anything to give it to you. &gt;&gt; That brother is mean. &gt;&gt; That sister is mean. &gt;&gt; No, it's not a mean brother or a mean sister. It's a it's a it's a ant brother. &gt;&gt; Are we together?" &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's an ant sister. a brother that knows how to discipline you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If not, you will continue to do the same thing over and over. &gt;&gt; Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? AMEN. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE WE GOT PARASITE IN THE MESSAGE. &gt;&gt; I'm trying to take off from the airport. WE GOT MINISTER THAT ARE PARASITE. WE GOT BELIEVER THAT ARE PARASITE &gt;&gt; THAT ARE LIVING OFF OTHER BELIEVERS all the time. &gt;&gt; THEY CAN MAKE A PROJECT BUT THEY MAKE A PROJECT FROM YOUR BACK. [cheering] &gt;&gt; I don't know where that is coming from but I have to deliver. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; WHEN THEY WANT TO ATTEND A PROJECT THEY ARE WORKING A PROJECT BASED ON THE CHURCH. &gt;&gt; HOW MUCH PEOPLE ARE IN THE CHURCH? HOW MANY PEOPLE WILL CONTRIBUTE &gt;&gt; OR HOW MUCH PEOPLE ARE IN THAT CHURCH AND BEFORE YOU KNOW IT THEY BEGIN TO GO FROM ONE CHURCH TO ONE ANOTHER AND COLLECT THE PEOPLE NUMBER BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO WORK. &gt;&gt; I seen THIS EVEN AMONG MINISTERS &gt;&gt; THEY ARE COLLECTING BELIEVERS NUMBER ALL OVER THE UNITED STATES. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. SO IF THEY'RE GOING THROUGH ONE THING, THEY'RE SENDING 100 MESSAGES. &gt;&gt; So this one give $200. This one give $500. The naive give $1,000. And this one give Yeah. The naive give $2,000. And this one and before you know it, they're sitting down right STRAIGHT WITH A $20,000 JUST LIKE THAT WITH A PICTURE OF A HOUSE THAT HAVE FELL DOWN. &gt;&gt; AND THAT PICTURE HAS BEEN GOING AROUND EVERY BELIEVER. CAN YOU SAY AMEN my friend? I don't want to hear about I don't want to depend on your amen. SAY AMEN OVER HERE. THEY TAKE ONE PICTURE AND THEY GO AROUND WITH ONE PICTURE AND IT GOES FROM ONE PASTOR TO ANOTHER AND ONE PASTOR TO ANOTHER AND THEY MAKE A COLLECTION. &gt;&gt; BUT THE TIME HAS COME &gt;&gt; FOR PEOPLE to be disciplined. &gt;&gt; IF A MAN DOES NOT WORK, &gt;&gt; HE WON'T EVEN EAT. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; WE NEED TO BE A DISCIPLINED CHURCH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; A CHURCH THAT KNOWS HOW TO WORK. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND THAT KNOWS HOW TO PLAN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Are we together? When you make a plan, make a plan for yourself &gt;&gt; with your own means &gt;&gt; and let everybody else blessing come over &gt;&gt; like an abundance. This is the way you operate in life. &gt;&gt; I don't know if we together. &gt;&gt; I don't know if we together. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Did I shake you wrong? &gt;&gt; I'm sorry. I can't back it up. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not me. It's the end. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's the mystery of an end. &gt;&gt; If you don't work, you won't eat. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; EVEN PAUL TOLD TIMOTHY, HE SAID, "BEFORE YOU consider a widow, &gt;&gt; make sure she did this.

THIS MAN TRULY WAS GOD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; OKAY. BROTHER BRHAM SAYS THIS IN THE MESSAGE, THE unconditional covenant, speaking about GENESIS 18, HE SAY THAT WAS NOT THE ANGEL OF THE LORD. &gt;&gt; THAT WAS GOD HIMSELF. &gt;&gt; In Genesis 18, he was not the form of the angel of the Lord. HE WAS GOD HIMSELF IN HUMAN FORM. BROTHER BRHAM SAID THAT WAS GOD HIMSELF. ABRAHAM SAID HE WAS &gt;&gt; HE HAD ON WATER &gt;&gt; FLOWS LIKE A MAN &gt;&gt; AND THAT'S ALL OVER HIM COME FROM A WHAT? &gt;&gt; A FAR COUNTRY &gt;&gt; BUT WE KNOW THAT HEAVEN IS HERE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; BUT IT'S FAR INH BASED ON DIMENSIONS &gt;&gt; BUT NOT ON DISTANCE. WE ALREADY WENT THROUGH THIS IN QUESTION AND ANSWER. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; AMEN. BROTHER BRHAM SAYS HE SAID BY ONE DAY WHILE SAILING ON the water &gt;&gt; his old &gt;&gt; ABRAHAM HE SEES HOW MANY MEN? &gt;&gt; Three men coming UP. &gt;&gt; HE WAS A SPIRITUAL MAN AND REALIZED THAT THEM WAS NOT ORDINARY MEN. &gt;&gt; THOUGH THEY HAD DUST ON THEM, THEY HAVE TRAVELED FROM A WHAT? &gt;&gt; THE FAR COUNTRY. &gt;&gt; YES. ALL THE WAY FROM WHERE? &gt;&gt; HEAVEN. &gt;&gt; SO THE FAR AWAY COUNTRY MEANS HEAVEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN.

SHAKE SOMEBODY, MY FRIEND. &gt;&gt; If even in front of you behind, shake somebody. Shake somebody.

I'm trying to stay where we going. He said, "A man to a far country who called water?" &gt;&gt; His own servants. &gt;&gt; Uh-huh. And did water &gt;&gt; delivered unto them HIS GOODS. SO EVERYBODY THAT WAS CALLED WAS A SERVANT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; EVEN THOUGH ONE OF THEM WAS A WICKED one &gt;&gt; this IS THE PARABLE OF THE TALENT. We saw that last Sunday. &gt;&gt; AMEN. EVERY ONE OF THEM WERE SERVANT. &gt;&gt; BUT NOT EVERYBODY WHO SERVANT WILL DO THE WILL OF the master. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We are going somewhere. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND THE MASTER DELIVER HIS GOODS. &gt;&gt; This word goods here means money. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Since I don't hear amen, I'm going to give you the scripture &gt;&gt; where we are. Jump to verse 18. &gt;&gt; And then we we go back up again. &gt;&gt; But he that have received what? One &gt;&gt; went and did what? &gt;&gt; Digg in the earth. &gt;&gt; Dug in the earth AND HID THE LORD'S WHAT? &gt;&gt; MONEY. &gt;&gt; Can you now say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because when I say money, we recharge.

HE DELIVERED THEM TO WHAT? &gt;&gt; SERVANTS. &gt;&gt; Servant what? &gt;&gt; Goods. &gt;&gt; Singular or plural? &gt;&gt; PLURAL. &gt;&gt; SO HE GOT WHAT? &gt;&gt; MANY. &gt;&gt; HE GOT WHAT? &gt;&gt; MONEY. &gt;&gt; This is the wealth of God. &gt;&gt; Don't worry, you will say amen sooner because some of you are waiting for brother.

AMEN. &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; SO IT'S AN ETERNAL FAITH &gt;&gt; OF GOD THAT HE HAS DELIVERED TO PEOPLE &gt;&gt; BECAUSE PAUL SAY HE HAS GIVEN A MEASURE OF FAITH &gt;&gt; UNTO EACH. OH MY FRIEND, &gt;&gt; IT'S WRITTEN IN YOUR BIBLE. PAUL SAY HE HAS GIVEN WHAT? &gt;&gt; MEASURE. &gt;&gt; A MEASURE OF [screaming] WHAT? &gt;&gt; FAITH. &gt;&gt; SOME HAVE FIVE. &gt;&gt; SOME HAVE TWO AND SOME HAVE ONE.

The one that are delivered there if you say to this mountain &gt;&gt; be moved the mountain must stand the same. &gt;&gt; AMEN. SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO ENVY SOMEBODY'S FAITH. &gt;&gt; NO SIR. [cheering] &gt;&gt; You didn't get me. THE LITTLE BIT THE FAITH THAT YOU HAVE, YOU CAN DO GREATER WORKS. &gt;&gt; [cheering] &gt;&gt; BROTHER BRHAM HAS HIS CATEGORY. &gt;&gt; THAT WAS BROTHER BRHAM. USE THE FAITH OF THE SON OF GOD THAT HE HAS GIVEN YOU. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; I HOPE WE ARE TOGETHER. &gt;&gt; I HOPE WE ARE TOGETHER. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Oh God, I thought this lesson will be quick. &gt;&gt; Can I continue? Where are we at my friend? &gt;&gt; Verse 15. And he gave to one water &gt;&gt; five talents &gt;&gt; and to the other one &gt;&gt; two. &gt;&gt; So this here we can apply it naturally. Where message believer go and then we can go spiritually &gt;&gt; which we just apply which was faith &gt;&gt; and the amen went to the roof. &gt;&gt; Amen. Don't worry, I'm going to handle that. We clear? Amen. &gt;&gt; Verse 15. And to one he gave what? &gt;&gt; Five talents. &gt;&gt; To the second he gave what? &gt;&gt; Two. &gt;&gt; And to another he gave what? &gt;&gt; One. &gt;&gt; And every man, ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; ACCORDING TO WHAT? &gt;&gt; His several ability. &gt;&gt; In other word, ACCORDING TO HIS OWN ABILITY. &gt;&gt; I hope WE TOGETHER. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; SO WHEN GOD GIVES &gt;&gt; THIS MONEY HERE THAT WAS given A talent. &gt;&gt; A talent &gt;&gt; in the Bible. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; A talent in the Bible. &gt;&gt; One talent equals 6,000 salary of a day. &gt;&gt; I don't know if you get me. SO YOU TAKE THE PAY of one day, you multiply that by 6,000. That's one talent. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; So if THIS MAN RECEIVE FIVE TALENT, &gt;&gt; IT MEANS THAT GOD GAVE HIM 30,000. &gt;&gt; I hope we are TOGETHER NOW. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY I SAY THIS MAN GOT MONEY. WE WILL GET TO THAT. &gt;&gt; Don't worry. We will get to that. &gt;&gt; HE'S A RICH MAN. &gt;&gt; THIS MAN IS A RICH MAN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; DON'T WORRY.

That word several means own. &gt;&gt; According to his own what? &gt;&gt; Ability. &gt;&gt; ABILITY. SO WHEN GOD GIVE, GOD ALREADY KNEW THE ABILITY IN YOU. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Can you help me please? &gt;&gt; IN OTHER WORDS, THE TALENT OF GOD HAD A MESSAGE. AMEN. &gt;&gt; THE TALENT HAD A MESSAGE. &gt;&gt; THE MESSAGE WAS YOU GOT THE ABILITY &gt;&gt; TO DO IT. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; I hope we ARE TOGETHER. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; EVEN THE ONE THAT GOT ONE &gt;&gt; THEY GAVE HIM ACCORDING TO WHAT? &gt;&gt; Seven ability. &gt;&gt; SO THERE WAS AN ABILITY &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE MONEY THAT WAS GIVEN THE TOTAL IS ETERNITY. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; IT'S A MONEY THAT HAVE MONEY INSIDE. &gt;&gt; I hope we ARE TOGETHER. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; SO THIS MONEY ALREADY HAVE MONEY &gt;&gt; THAT NEEDED TO BE MANIFESTED. &gt;&gt; I hope WE ARE TOGETHER. &gt;&gt; BUT GOD DIDN'T WANT TO DO THAT. THAT'S RIGHT. [applause] &gt;&gt; GOD GIVE YOU THE OPPORTUNITY TO BRING IT OUT. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; The master COULD HAVE DONE HIS OWN investment &gt;&gt; and BRING EVERYTHING OUT BUT HE CALL SERVANT TO BE PART &gt;&gt; OF HIS MINISTRY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. YES SIR. AMEN. AND ENTRUSTED TO THOSE SERVANT MONEY SO THAT YOUR WORK &gt;&gt; WILL PRODUCE WHAT THE MASTER HAVE IN MIND. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; IN OTHER WORDS, GOD HAS CERTAIN THINGS THAT HE WANT TO FULFILL &gt;&gt; BUT HE WANT TO FULFILL IT THROUGH YOU. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; AMEN. THE GIVING OF THE MONEY WAS AN OPENING OF A NEW SEASON. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; It was opening &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; of a new season. &gt;&gt; Amen.

I'M TRUSTING ON HIM &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HIS CHURCH ARE PERFECT. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? Are we together? &gt;&gt; Job 2 verse 16. &gt;&gt; Then he that receiveth what? &gt;&gt; The five talents &gt;&gt; went and do what? &gt;&gt; Traded with the same. &gt;&gt; So somebody went to work. &gt;&gt; Somebody begin to work. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Begin to work with and traded the same and made what &gt;&gt; them other five talents. &gt;&gt; So the five produces five. So he doubled. He got 100% return. &gt;&gt; You know this. &gt;&gt; Go ahead my friend. And what? &gt;&gt; And likewise he that had received two. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; He also gained two. &gt;&gt; Please follow me very care. Let's let's stay focused. Okay. &gt;&gt; Uh-huh.

SO A LAZY PERSON DOESN'T MEAN JUST HE'S NOT WORKING. HE'S NOT DOING WHAT HE'S SUPPOSED TO DO, &gt;&gt; BUT HE'S DOING SOMETHING ELSE. &gt;&gt; HE'S BUSY WITH THINGS THAT ARE UNPRODUCTIVE. [screaming] &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; WATCH WHAT YOU DOING IN YOUR LIFE. &gt;&gt; WATCH WHAT YOU SPENDING TIME WITH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; WHAT IS HE PRODUCING? &gt;&gt; AMEN.

I'm also doing some work. &gt;&gt; But when you ask him, YOU SAY, "WHAT DID YOU GET?" &gt;&gt; The work he did was to hide the talent &gt;&gt; so he can get a free time. TO GO MIND ANY OTHER BUSINESS OTHER THAN THE FATHER'S BUSINESS. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; SO HIS WORK WAS ONLY TAKING HIM AWAY FROM THE COMMISSION, &gt;&gt; AWAY FROM THE COMMANDMENT, &gt;&gt; AWAY FROM THE WORD OF THE BOSS. THE WORD WAS BE GET TO WORK. &gt;&gt; BUT HIS WORK TAKE HIM OFF THE PATH. &gt;&gt; So when everybody else was busy working, &gt;&gt; he didn't have anything to do. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; HE WAS JUST CHILLING OUT &gt;&gt; UNDER THE PRETENSE OF BEING CAUTIOUS. [applause] &gt;&gt; You didn't get ME WELL. HE HAS A REASON WHEN YOU ASK HIM WHY YOU DON'T WORK. NO, NO, NO. I DON'T WANT TO LOSE the money. &gt;&gt; SO, HE'S APPEARING TO BE CAUTIOUS, &gt;&gt; BUT IT'S NOT REALLY CAUTIOUS. HE'S a lazy man. &gt;&gt; BUT HE'S COVERING HIS LAZINESS BY CAUTIOUSNESS. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; IF SOMEBODY NEEDED TO BE CAUTIOUS, WHO SHOULD BE MORE CAUTIOUS? &gt;&gt; HIM OR THE FACT? BUT THE FIVE TALENT TOOK RISK. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. AMEN. &gt;&gt; THE TWO TALENT TOOK RISK. &gt;&gt; BUT THE ONE THAT HAVE THE LIST IS THE ONE THAT IS WORRYING MORE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; I hope WE ARE TOGETHER. &gt;&gt; AND HE SAYS I FEAR. &gt;&gt; SO FEAR. THAT'S WHY BROTHER BRANDHAM PREACH ALL THE TIME. FEAR NOT. BE NOT AFRAID. BE NOT AFRAID. BECAUSE FEAR IS A CURSE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT.

That's right. &gt;&gt; So from the going of the master to the return of the master, it's a long time. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. Amen. &gt;&gt; So there is a going of the master AND A COMING BACK OF THE MASTER. &gt;&gt; In between the going and the coming back, it's a long time. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In other words, THERE IS A SEASON. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; THERE IS A PERIOD OF TIME. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; WHERE THE MASTER WON'T BE THERE. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; We clear. &gt;&gt; Amen. We clear? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Bible says after a long time, THE LORD OF THOSE SERVANT did what? &gt;&gt; Come in. &gt;&gt; And reckon with them. In other word, ask them to settle their account. &gt;&gt; Brother Brham says this BEFORE WE SAW. HE SAYS NOW BECAUSE WE HAVE WHAT? &gt;&gt; A RESPONSIBILITY &gt;&gt; THAT WE GOT TO ANSWER TO GOD SOMEDAY FOR. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; EVERY MAN THAT COME ON THE FACE OF THE EARTH HAS TO DO WHAT? answers to God &gt;&gt; for a responsibility. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Too many of us a stewardship WE HAVE TO ANSWER FOR. THIS RESPONSIBILITY IS A STEWARDSHIP THAT HAS BEEN COMMITTED TO US BY WHO? &gt;&gt; GOD. &gt;&gt; I DON'T CARE WHAT IT IS. &gt;&gt; When we read this like this, we usually put this in men. &gt;&gt; Especially preacher. We'll put that in the pastor or the deacon or the trustee. We say you the one that got responsibility. God will tell you what to do. But let's continue WITH BROTHER BRHAM. BROTHER BRHAM SAY AS I SAID A FEW MOMENT A WHAT? &gt;&gt; A HOUSEWIFE. &gt;&gt; SO A HOUSEWIFE IS A RESPONSIBILITY. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THEN BE A WHAT? &gt;&gt; A genuine housewife. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. IF I BE IF IF TO BE A WHAT? &gt;&gt; A FARMER. &gt;&gt; THEN BE WHAT? &gt;&gt; A genuine farmer. &gt;&gt; Whatever it is that God HAS PUT YOU TO DO, &gt;&gt; YOU GOT A STEWARDSHIP TO DO THAT. TO THAT YOU GOT TO ANSWER TO GOD FOR BECAUSE HE TAKE ALL THESE THINGS TO WHAT &gt;&gt; TO do it. &gt;&gt; So at the end of the day we got to answer before God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we clear so far? Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's continue my friend. JOB TO VERSE 20. AND SO HE THAT HAVE RECEIVED what &gt;&gt; five talents &gt;&gt; and brought water &gt;&gt; other five talents. &gt;&gt; He says Lord YOU DELIVER THE FIVE TALENT.

SOLOMON SAYS THAT HE THAT HAVE PITY UPON WHAT? &gt;&gt; THE POOR. &gt;&gt; HE DOES WHAT? &gt;&gt; Lendeth unto the Lord. &gt;&gt; UNTO THE LORD THAT WHICH AND THAT WHICH HE HAS GIVEN, HE WILL DO WHAT? &gt;&gt; PAY HIM AGAIN. &gt;&gt; SO WE FOUND OUT THAT ACCORDING TO THE PROVERB, THERE IS NOT ONLY A LAYING OFF TO THE FUTURE, THERE IS ALSO A LAW OF RETURN. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; ON THIS EARTH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU GIVING TO THE POOR, &gt;&gt; YOU ARE ACTUALLY LENDING TO GOD. &gt;&gt; AND GOD IS IS WORKING TWO WAYS. &gt;&gt; NUMBER ONE, HE'S REPAYING YOU BACK [screaming] ON EARTH. &gt;&gt; AND NUMBER TWO, HE'S ALSO LAYING THINGS FOR YOU ON THE FUTURE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; AMEN. THE BIBLE SAYS THIS AGAIN IN LUKE 6. GIVE any water &gt;&gt; shall be GIVEN UNTO YOU. &gt;&gt; HOW &gt;&gt; GOOD MEASURE &gt;&gt; DO WHAT? &gt;&gt; PRESSED DOWN &gt;&gt; AND WHAT &gt;&gt; AND SHAKEN TOGETHER &gt;&gt; AND &gt;&gt; AND RUNNING OVER &gt;&gt; SHALL MEN [screaming] GIVE UNTO WHAT? &gt;&gt; YOUR BOSOM. &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; Give and it SHALL BE GIVEN BACK TO YOU. HOW A GOOD MEASURE. IN OTHER WORDS, WHEN YOU GIVE, WHEN GOD IS BRINGING BACK TO YOU, IT IS NOT JUST GIVING YOU. HE MUST BE PUT DOWN &gt;&gt; SHAKEN TOGETHER &gt;&gt; AND WHAT? &gt;&gt; SHAKEN TOGETHER. &gt;&gt; AH, CAN WE READ IT TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; CAN WE GIVE IT TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU GIVE, &gt;&gt; YOU GIVE EASILY. &gt;&gt; BUT WHEN IT'S TIME TO PAY YOU BACK, &gt;&gt; IT DOESN'T COME THE WAY YOU GIVE. &gt;&gt; GOD SAY IT WILL COME A GOOD MEASURE. &gt;&gt; THAT IS HOW PRESSED DOWN. &gt;&gt; SO THEY BRING IT. THEY SAY, "WHO IS IT?" BROTHER TRAMAN. They put it down. THEY SAY, "AH, IT'S NOT FINISHED." PRESS IT DOWN. &gt;&gt; AND AFTER YOU PRESS DOWN, WHAT DO YOU DO? &gt;&gt; SHAKE IT TOGETHER. &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU SHAKE IT TOGETHER, SO HE SEE HE MAKES MORE ROOM. &gt;&gt; Are we together? [cheering] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? AND WHEN HE MAKE MORE ROOM, YOU FILL IT. &gt;&gt; AND HE MUST DO WHAT? &gt;&gt; RUN OVER. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY DAVID SAY, "MY CUP DOES WHAT? &gt;&gt; RUNTH OVER." &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? SO WHEN YOU giving in the mortal um in the mortal season when you giving to the poor there is a law of return first on the earth &gt;&gt; before you die. &gt;&gt; God cannot owe you something. &gt;&gt; Because you LENDED TO GOD. &gt;&gt; BROTHER BRANDHAM SAY GOD RETURN A THOUSANDFOLD. &gt;&gt; GOD MUST RETURN BACK TO YOU. &gt;&gt; AMEN.

THAT'S WHY PAUL PUT IT ALL TOGETHER. &gt;&gt; YOU READY? PAUL SAY, "CHUDGE THEM THAT ARE WHAT? &gt;&gt; RICH IN THIS WORLD &gt;&gt; IN THE MORTAL SEASON THAT THEY BE NOT WHAT? &gt;&gt; HIGH MINDED. &gt;&gt; WE DON'T WANT THEM TO BE PROUD NOR WHAT &gt;&gt; TRUST in uncertain riches &gt;&gt; like the rich young ruler, BUT IN THE WATER.

When God replenish back, you give again &gt;&gt; and God replenish back again and you add more in heaven. &gt;&gt; IT'S A CIRCLE. EVERY TIME YOU GIVE, HE COMES BACK and he deposit in heaven. IT COMES BACK AND then it deposit in HEAVEN IN. SO YOU ARE PROSPERING IN BOTH WAYS. &gt;&gt; YOU ARE PROSPERING ON THE EARTH AND YOU ARE ALSO PROSPERING IN HEAVEN. &gt;&gt; I KNOW WHERE I'm going, my friend. &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? PAUL SAID THAT THEY DO WHAT? &gt;&gt; GOOD.

UHOH. &gt;&gt; CAN YOU ANSWER MY QUESTION? HOW CAN YOU GIVE HOW? &gt;&gt; RICHLY. &gt;&gt; IF YOU DON'T HAVE IT. &gt;&gt; SO GOD [screaming] MUST BE HOW? &gt;&gt; RICH. &gt;&gt; Let go. Let go, MY FRIEND. GOD MUST BE HOW? &gt;&gt; RICH. &gt;&gt; TO BE ABLE TO GIVE YOU HOW? &gt;&gt; RICHLY. &gt;&gt; IF YOU HAVE A HARD TIME, SWALLOW THIS.

His rich is in glory. &gt;&gt; And now headed. &gt;&gt; Look at this my friend. &gt;&gt; FOR WE KNOW THE WHAT &gt;&gt; the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; The Lord Jesus Christ come though he was &gt;&gt; rich. I just &gt;&gt; I told you at the beginning &gt;&gt; that the God that was in a parable was rich. &gt;&gt; You were reserved. I say I will bring brother. I told you God give you richly because he was rich. Some of you are still struggling. I showed you that in glory there is riches. &gt;&gt; Some of you still struggling. Now another scripture the Bible say the Lord Jesus Christ who was how? So God is how &gt;&gt; precisely the Lord Jesus Christ is how &gt;&gt; rich. &gt;&gt; This is your problem. &gt;&gt; Your problem is here. &gt;&gt; Your problem is here. &gt;&gt; HE SAYS THOUGH he was what? &gt;&gt; Rich. &gt;&gt; Yet for your what? &gt;&gt; He became what? &gt;&gt; Poor. &gt;&gt; So who made him poor? &gt;&gt; ME. &gt;&gt; Now you begin to understand. &gt;&gt; AH. SO THE SO originally &gt;&gt; originally &gt;&gt; originally &gt;&gt; JESUS CHRIST is rich. &gt;&gt; ORIGINALLY HE'S LLEON. [cheering] &gt;&gt; HE IS THE SON OF PROSPERITY. &gt;&gt; ORIGINALLY HE'S THE ONE THAT SOLOMON REFLECTED. HE'S THE ONE THAT JOSEPH reflected &gt;&gt; originally. HE IS [screaming] RICH. &gt;&gt; BUT TO SAVE YOU, &gt;&gt; HELP ME GO TO THE AIRPORT &gt;&gt; TO SAVE YOU, HE BECAME WHAT? &gt;&gt; HIM BECOMING POOR DOESN'T [screaming] MEAN HE'S RICH. HE'S NOT RICH. THAT POVERTY WAS A HUMILITY. &gt;&gt; HE HUMBLE HIMSELF. HE CONDESCENDED. &gt;&gt; YOU DON'T GET ME WELL. &gt;&gt; YOU DON'T GET me well. &gt;&gt; I'm trying to go to the airport. I got to turn around. &gt;&gt; This is your God. &gt;&gt; This is called rich. &gt;&gt; This is your God. &gt;&gt; Then they say, "Go pick up brother Charles. &gt;&gt; He took this Amen. &gt;&gt; And he put this like this. &gt;&gt; And he came. &gt;&gt; And this is what we all preach. &gt;&gt; We all preach here. &gt;&gt; We don't want to talk about THE QUOTE. &gt;&gt; We are preaching here. &gt;&gt; Jesus is this.

Where was the bread coming from? WHO WAS CREATING THE WHO WAS COOKING the bread? &gt;&gt; WHO WAS COOKING THE BREAD? WHERE WAS THE BREAD? &gt;&gt; WHERE WAS HE PRODUCING THE BREAD? FROM HIS RICHES &gt;&gt; in glory. &gt;&gt; From his riches in glory. &gt;&gt; THAT WAS NOT SPIRITUAL BREAD. THEY WERE NATURAL BREAD. &gt;&gt; THEY WERE NOT SPIRITUAL FISHES. NATURAL FISHES. HE WAS NOT A SPIRITUAL SQUIRREL, &gt;&gt; A NATURAL SQUIRREL. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together?

SO AS HE WAS COMING POOR, HE COULD NOT COME TO A RICH JOSEPH. &gt;&gt; THAT JOSEPH'S LIFE WAS NOW CHANGED TO A POOR MAN &gt;&gt; TO MATCH THE POOR coming [cheering] &gt;&gt; this SIDE.

[music] &gt;&gt; Father, thanking you for your grace, for your love, for your mercy, and for everything you have been doing for us. Father, there is no way a man can see these things. It only takes the supernatural action of the Holy Spirit to unfold your word in such a way that we can see clarity and understand who truly you are Lord. Father we have a picture painted many ways by Catholic [music] by Jehovah witnesses even among the message that the picture was not painted right. [music] But father, you are bringing the right angle where we can turn the picture to the right and we will see you clearly and say that is Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That is our God. &gt;&gt; That's the one that died on the cross for us. That the one that took our place. That the one that stripped himself. The one that sanctify himself. That refused to even be married so that we can be married. Hallelujah. that refuse to have natural children so that we can have children. [music] He spoke from his mouth that I sanctify myself. You sanctify yourself so that your children can reap the benefit of your sanctification. Father, may we take a hold of Calvary of all the benefit that you shed the blood for. May you help this church and your children all over the world so that we can come up to the clear understanding and revelation of who you are. Amen. Because you are a big God that our mind cannot even comprehend because you are the one that feel space time and eternity. Oh God, help us up and take the sermon that was preached, Lord. And may Oh God, Father, [music] you continue to work on it. And if time again, may we come back, Lord, and continue to go [music] and continue, Lord, Father, to enjoy this blessing that you are unfolding to us day by day. We commit everything unto the hand and humbly ask it, Father, in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. [music] &gt;&gt; God bless you, church. &gt;&gt; We love you. &gt;&gt; [music] &gt;&gt; because [music] we didn't get to what I was trying to preach. Just bear with me. Be patient. We will get that. You can call this from Joseph to Joseph. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. [music] &gt;&gt; From a poor Joseph to a rich Joseph. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. There is a reason why he have to identify [music] like that. We prone so much about his poverty &gt;&gt; but he say at mad death identify him &gt;&gt; back again to where he came from.
