me he has a co-worker named David Davis who they've diagnosed him with the kovat so he wanted prayer for him and as of yesterday there has been a attacks irken circulating the women some of the women have a group on the text and it been circulating there that sister Carrie Thomas's sister-in-law her name is Cindy I think it's brother Duane sister she's also been diagnosed with the Kovac Luka corona so we want to remember that and if anybody else has does anybody have a praise report before we go to prayer with this anybody have a praise report we're together hey man now I'm gonna I'm gonna push I'm gonna push brother Nate to get more chairs the capacity in here is 300 and they've cut us down to 1/4 and they didn't charge us for the extra room but if we have to stay safe maybe we can pay it a couple times till this thing's finally over I don't know who do you okay let's do that after the we pray over them why don't you come up and you can pray over the the to prayer requests and then you can give your testimony does anybody else have a prayer requested I like to bring up come on up brother Abel nobody else well that's great everybody's doing wonderful and then right no problems nobody's shouting about anything but there's still there's no problems so that's good hey man let's all bow our heads today Lord we just come before you this morning Lord just counted a privilege to be gathered together amongst our brothers and sisters Lord just with the craziness in the world lore but yeah we can still gather together as brothers and sisters Lord and just to lift your name to to worship you Lord we just ask for this service that you just have your wonderful will and way Lord be in the speaking Lord may we just open up our hearts to receive Lord but we thank you for the services that have gone on through this this livestreaming Lord and how much of a blessing they've been lord we love you and appreciate you for everything that you do Lord daily being in our lives and taking care of a store keeping us safe Lord you heard both requests Lord for two different individuals that have came down with the corona Lord Lord we know there's many others as well Lord even outside of the church Lord just in the world but we ask that you just you know come down Lord and just heal Lord bring healing to the others that are being afflicted by this this demon I'll say that's going around Lord trying to make each one sick Lord Lord one of the names was David Davis lord I pray that you just touch that situation Lord and I forget the other name but Lord may you just be in that condition Lord may you just bring healing we pray Lord we love you and thank you for everything you do Lord we pray that you just give us each a closer walk with you Lord we love you and thank you and pray just have your way in Jesus name in them and also Lord just bless us offering the Lord as as people give their tithes and offering Lord may you just bless it as well we pray in Jesus name so I just quick testimonial it happened a week or two ago but my me and my wife were driving down the road and we were going speed limit it was like 50 I think this turbulence 15 when we're going 50 and a deer jumped right out in front of us and I hit my brakes but I mean if it was if it was a foot closer we would have destroyed our car and it passed by and then right after the single deer passed by a deer followed it in the car coming the opposite way hit that deer and totaled their front end of their car and the deer flew up it's went off their windshield and flew up right over top of me and Destiny's vehicle so the first one got right in front of us and the second one went right over top of us and I knew that was just the Angels just pushing the deer away so I just wanted to praise the Lord for that thank you for that I want to take just a minute as well prior to the Cova thing causing us to be separated it was on my heart then that because we have a candidate for pastor that we should take a vote on him if we don't want him in then we can bring others in okay as opposed to a competition or whatever you want to call it but because you know we've been separated it just hasn't been an opportunity to bring this up and it's just really it's been an extreme burden on my heart for about two months that you know brother Brennan said a pastor needs to be a solid teacher and we have teachers we have solid teachers and we have a candidate and regardless of you know who else might be qualified or we we have to look at the one that we have and not delay we're someone seven months into this is this group and I just sang about having a voice in heaven let me lift my voice that's what I'm doing and the other song I would not be denied I don't want my voice denied I don't want anybody else who feels the same way about having a vote to have their voice tonight I'm saying it is I'm asking if we cannot have a meeting after service next week here to arrange to extend like we have in the past and hold a vote on the candidate that we have not a paper vote we can't have an online vote so we need the people that are streaming that would be willing to come in and vote to do so in person that's the only way that it can be done to be scriptural and it's long it's been long enough if you know if we don't want our candidate as a pastor make your voice heard lift your voice and vote no but if you do then we need to go ahead we can't have trustees we can't have deacons I'm a fill in because a song leader is a pastor appointed position the pastor's ultimately responsible for the service and the worship I'm just filling in brother Abel would fill in as well so we need to get back to the work we need to get especially within the limits of the message and write and do it soon so we can establish ourselves as a proper Church so I hope I'm not by myself standing here voicing this okay and we need to go ahead while we're here and talk to the people about getting the room for next week for at least two hours this is a pastoral issue it will only be about electing a pastor not money not anything else it's just just has to be done that's you know so let's stand I don't want to kill a spirit I didn't want to come across wrong and it jeopardize any any kind of a spirit or place a bad one here in the service so we're gonna sing because he lives it's our old from the goal isn't it to live like he lives and then we'll invite brother Micah Holloway to come as we as we sing this because he I can face tomorrow because sound like it's working amen amen praise the Lord Amen it's certainly good to be back and see your faces amen and I know it's a little while and my wife were just talking with the good in the love the Lord and for dimmed out of the called according to his purpose and brother Graham says in many places there's nothing out of catered never he said I as it may look that way he said but God always has it under control so I just want to thank God for that appreciate the the burden brother John has in his heart that he shared this morning for for the pastoral office cuz we do that is something that we need to address soon and but I will say that we do have a small body to the problem you see the for moment we do have a committee and that committee has been discussing these matters and and so uh so it is something under advisement and as soon as the committee is ready to move forward with this local assembly then they'll present what those options are but uh but I do assure you where the Shango was definitely uh Canada on the table and and we believe he's uh I should say gifted minister would be an understatement man it's definitely got a gift it's uh outstanding when it comes to teaching ministry don't don't know a lot of brothers like it I say that sincerely and and I know he's a man has got a call in and his desire to be a pastor and so we respect that too but but as far as how we proceed it may be next weekend I make service it may not be but but we definitely want to make sure that when we move forward we do it in the right way and the confidence when this assembly is been put into the hands of the committee and the committee is going to move forward according to how they feel late as a committee so I just want to say acknowledges comments but let's just be aware that there is a proper way to move forward and so we want to we want to definitely respect that but but I do believe that they'll probably be a vote soon and and like I said under brother Stephens expressed his interest and far as I know he's the only brother and I missed a sexy expressed a desire so uh so I do believe he will be a consideration when that vote is cast but I don't know if it'll be in a week or two weeks we were not prepared to say that just yet but one thing we do want to do is wait if there's enough people present so when the vote does go forward that the body as a whole has the best opportunity to vote on it amen amen thank man if you have your Bibles and invite you to turn me the book of the book of Genesis the book of Genesis and we've got a pretty simple thought in our heart as always I did want to say this that you know I haven't had a chance or I haven't I should say stream the service probably in five weeks maybe six I know when we first started streaming i I caught the first service brother Stephen did I think I caught half of the second service brother Stephen did because we had the minister that evening so we didn't have a chance to finish out the service but but I really we don't have much of a clue of what he's preached on the past five or six weeks because we hadn't screamed in their services so I'm just kind of craft without what we have this morning will fit in the continuity whatever the Holy Spirit's already been doing and just be a thought that'll add to what God's already been doing to help take this local symbol a bit further look in Genesis chapter 3 in Genesis chapter 3 and before we read let's just bow as for a word of Prayer dear Heavenly Father Lord we just want to give you thanks thank you for your grace for your fellowship thank you Lord for allowing us to come together as a local assembly again Lord you know all the needs that are present in order desires upon our hearts each one of us even as a brother John just expressed that great burden for a headship and Lord that's what we want to talk about this morning his headship Lord just assembly needs the headship it needs a man is called a God gifted of God anointed by God for a purpose for this assembly cannot be all that you or data to be without such a man in position Lord official desire to be brother Stephen Lord may you bless him and your hand Grace place him there and God may he be a light in this area to this assembly as a leader ordained by you for the purpose of taking your bride forward the Lord we desire above all that that will be done Lord I have no motive one way or the other just accident sure will be done I'll offer this service we asked the same it's been a wool house and we come together maybe the atmosphere feels a little different maybe there's different thoughts on different mind what's gonna happen how does it feel what's what's going on the Lord as we've already said and testify about a mafia prophet nothing's out of cater all things under your control so god I'm accent first that you forgive us of our sins and actually forgive me first lord help our minds and our hearts be pure before you this morning may we be in one Accord as they were there pentecost one mind and one Accord lord they were one bit lord but i believe you exceeded far beyond the expectations of god for they never understood that the almighty god was not gonna come down in their presence below it you actually dwelt in them but actually should do the same today god made you come down in a special way as our brothers testified may we see christ and flesh once again not listen I'm mister guy with an anointing but God may you be able to dwell in the flesh of man to make yourself manifest in the mist that's our desire Lord Lord we commit this service into your hands Lord may you get out of it what you intended for it to be we ask this in Jesus Christ's name Amen amen amen Genesis 3 verse 9 and it says the Lord God called Adam and said to him well now and he said I heard that voice in the garden and I was afraid because I was naked and I hid myself he said who told you that I was naked has thou eaten of the tree whereof I commanded thee that thou she does not eat and the man said the woman whom thou give it to be with me she gave me other tree and I did eat and the Lord God said unto the woman what is just a dow is done and a woman 7 the surfing has beguiled me and I did the law of God said unto the serpent because thou has done this that were cursed above all cattle and above every beast of the field upon thy ability thou shalt go dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life and I will put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed and it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel until the woman he said I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception and sorrow thou shalt bring forth children and that's desire shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over thee spy his dear Lord we thank you once again for your word Lord we've read it and we know that's about all we can do lord I Maksim not at you'll anoint me afresh Lord may you bring back to inspiration that the people might benefit from O God that what you desire to share with this morning let it not be the words for man but God made me the words Almighty God and Lord I know you're worried whenever he goes forth it will always accomplish that which was sent to do that's our confidence we accident Jesus Christ name Amen amen the title of my message today is the hour of restoration the our restoration you see it a lot of times in the Bible the reference to our and identifying a particular event in my searching scriptures and I could be wrong but I did a little searching I didn't see it I never saw anything about any increments smaller than an hour this meant as this this hour and then in revelations chapter 8 it talks about the half hour which is still predicated upon the hour but you don't see minutes and hours use usually to identify a specific point in time when they said our of is coming you followed me and no man should know the day or the hour they use our to specify a particular time and usually because they want identify something that's going to happen at that particular time so my time is the hour of restoration I want to talk about restoration and we find in the scripture God and type was visiting his first church the Garden of Eden that was Adam and Eve and this visitation was taking place after the fall Adam had sinned Evette sinned and Adam has sinned by listening to the wisdom of his wife and Eve had sinned by listening to the reason of Satan and a form of the Serpent and and she was deceived because brother Branham says she had received a wrong interpretation of the word God had given her to word and she had the knowledge or another interpretation she said Satan was right there ready to give her another interpretation and the interpretation was so close that even ever recognized that the word had actually changed and what was being preached to her was not the original revelation are you follow me I want you to watch this so evil deceived by reasoning because when her reason is she received another interpretation and Eve brother Branham said was a perfect type of this New Testament church the age the time that you and I live in we are the New Testament church we're not of the old and this is a perfect type of what happened in the time in the garden with Adam and Eve in that hours something took place and brother Bama said he could see the same thing only repeating itself again are you following me and so evil is a type of the New Testament church and as a type of that church he being free could type she was actually taken from Adam who was her husband are you following me the one who she was created or taken from to be a help me to she was literally a part of Adam she was born of his bones she was flesh of his flesh she was literally spirit of his spirit he was nothing less than Adam are you following me reincarnated in another form but the men who send the message oneness she said she and animal 1 because her spirit her life even came from Adam Adam God didn't put another life in the eve she took Adams life and a part of Adam's life in the feminist form and that's what he may be from a perfect type of the church really literally bone of his bone we're flesh of his flesh what was his flesh as flesh was the word and the same spirit I was in Christ God literally taste that same spirit and he puts it into the New Testament church are you follow me son I want you to watch this he was so much like Adam that before the fall she even bought his name God did not see a difference come down to say Adam where is Eve when God came out I said Adam Adam where art thou he was actually calling the same person Genesis 1 Genesis 5:1 says and this is the book of generations of Adam listen Adam and the day God created man and his lightness God created he him male and female created he them now remember he's talking about one person Adam and blessed him and call their name their name Adam God did not place any separation between the two I want you to watch this so even from Adam she was literally a part of Adam they were one in heart they were one in spirit but then came to fall now why is Genesis 3 Genesis 3:16 until the woman he said I would greatly multiply thy sorrow and thy conception and sorrow thou shalt bring forth children why was her person killed why was her punishment in childbearing because she was given to Adam has to help me and that's what Adam needed was Animas commission to bring forth sons of God and he needed to help me somebody to have her in a job so God gave Eve to Adam at the time she was Adam he gave Adam - Adam for the purpose of Adam fulfilling his word his desire to bring forth sons of God so her fall was in the childbearing her suffer came to childbearing because she was created as a vessel for childbearing I want you to watch this and that desire speaking to Eve and that desire shall be to thy husband and he shall rule over thee here in Genesis 3:16 God had to come now in a certain hour and he had to restore her heart why because the serpent beguiled her by lust and perversion and turned her heart from Adam to serpent but God had to restore that woman's heart to the rightful man she couldn't do it Adam couldn't do it but God literally turned her heart back to her rightful husband this happened an hour of restoration Eve was found in the condition when she needed restoration and Adam couldn't do it she couldn't do it but God could and he did and that restoration was to turn our heart back because when she left God when she left the word when she left her husband she live all the same because listen she was created by God and given a word for the purpose of helping her husband to breathe for sons of God I want you to watch this so Eve was made and help me and same took advances opportunity because she was a free moral agent just like Adam was and Satan made her a proposition he gave her an opportunity and she turned her desire from her husband Adam to act on his proposition never recognize that she was leaving the word and God now I want you to kiss that cuz it's gonna be thought of my message she moved from her husband for which she was created for and she never recognized in her move she was leaving her husband and she was leaving the word as she was leaving God all in one act as she was so convinced she was feeling the will of God that she came back to Adam said honey let me show you what I've learned and she gave him of the tree that she had he know and Adam knew that she was wrong the program said but because of love his woman he took of it anyway but she came thinking she was doing the right thing are you with me and so she was given Adam for help me and Adam was too brief for all the sons in God and so he needed someone to have him in that position and God gave him an acceptable person to do that and that person was called Adam which he now called Eve but was saying over the proposition because she couldn't discern the word she accepted aloud but the truth now once you get this brother branham said that same told her that you'd be like gods he said and he wasn't lying to no good and evil he said well because Eve never knew both sides she only knew the good she never knew evil her brother Bama said but she never received that full promise why he said because she was deceived she never understood her wrong so she could never see her evil she could never see her evil that's why she took it to Adam she couldn't see where it was wrong remember this is a type of the New Testament church you can leave God you can leave your headship you can leave the word and never recognize you're wrong and then brag about it look what I've done are you follow me now I want you to watch this she was so deceived but the banner said when she was leaving the garden she was crying action Adam what's wrong what's wrong what's wrong he had knowledge of good and evil she never caught it and even after the fall outside of the garden look at Genesis 4:1 she never caught it Genesis 4:1 and Adam knew his wife and she conceived and bore Cain listen aim and when she for Cain she said and I have gotten a man from the Lord brother Branham said she wasn't wrong cuz any life that comes forth comes from God but he didn't recognize the perversion she had given birth to are you following me and she again bare his brother Abel and Abel was a keeper of the sheep but Cain was a tiller of the ground even though she got results from her actions her results were outside of the will of God and they were out sounded word god this is a perfect type listen Oh Matthew seven I want you to turn if you have your Bibles open Matthew seven Matthew 7:21 and I want to tell you how this typed the New Testament church people that can walk with God or people that can fellowship with God or people that can actually have gifts and people have great anointing and people could even do works and get results and you're not recognized they're completely out of the word will of God Matthew 7:21 not everyone that saith unto me Lord Lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven but he that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven many just said unto me in that day Lord Lord have we not prophesied in thy name and thy name cast out devils and in thy name done many wonderful works then listen and then will I profess unto them I never knew you depart from me ye that work of iniquity just as Cain was rejected and his works were rejected because he was actually a perversion of the will of God so will it be at the white throne judgment when there'll be many come up in his name and say I've done works in my name and they'll be rejected just like Cain why they did the work but their works were not accepted I don't just want to do works I really pray God have grace our brother Michael Holloway let my words be pleased in that site and in that great day let them be accepted now listen this group of Matthew seven they're like Balaam he was a man called he was a man gifted he was a man anointed he was a man of reputation and brother Branham said and he was a prophet he said some say Balaam was a soothsayer brother BAM said I deny that claim he said Balaam was a genuine prophet of the Lord he said as a matter of fact he still has prophesies this day that'll come in the past he said he was not a soothsayer he was a man that had given himself the false teaching but the gift was genuine the man was false but the gift was genuine now listen listen his gift was so vindicated that it was even known up unto the King's chambers when Israel's coming out of Egypt and they lack had heard he said this is the nation anointed by their God now he didn't realize that the God that they were anointed by was the same God that balaam talked to because they believe they believe I'm not believing me but what he calls multiple gods when you polytheism thank you brother they believe in polytheism you can have as many guys you can afford to pay tax to are you follow me but this man right here his reputation was so great that when the king heard about this nation of Israel coming up out of Egypt and Heidi described Freud ai and how dare destroy our Pharaoh and he would come this way bill I said my army is there no defense against his people because I heard that God fight for them so the only way to fight God is you got to get another God because flesh and blood cannot fight God they like knew this and when he wanted to get a man he said find me a man not be false people in my cab I know these are false preachers find me a real man like I get a hold of God they said sure we know one his name is Bill X that's the kind of man bill that was he was a man and knew God and he talked to God lip dear he would go into prayer and pray through is such an anointing that God will come down and save a leg what is it finish it with a thought I got something my heart Lord pull up a chair sit talk to me Bailey he said well I got some me and visit with you another country and they want me to come preach a sermon for free cities for him he loves me I know these people be like don't go with him they want trouble be like I got you here my servant you don't you're excused in this meeting you ain't got to appreciate some vision but I want to notice something the way Satan was able to get Eve off of the original Word of God was the same way he got bail on even though Baylor was a gifted man Benton was a northern man Balaam had been in God's presence on numerous occasions yet there was something way down impart that nobody else knew Bob a lo and God and Satan Satan has studied him he knew a bale of light he knew a Balaam didn't like Balaam didn't have to talk a whole lot he can read his action to say this man likes popularity or you follow me he likes the chief seats he likes going to the biggest meetings he can see what was in Valens heart not because he had a deserving gift but he can look at baylin's life and actions I see something in his man and so when the opportunity came he approached Baylor he was looking for something to get Balaam off of the word just like he was looking for something to get Eve off of the word just like he's looking at every one of us here a day to give you something to get you off of the word but it takes a real humble heart before the hand of Almighty God they said God I will not move unless you tell me thus said the Lord that's a rare person it's not that ratified people that had the knowledge of God it's not their fare to ride people that would even talk in his name but one that would humble themselves under the mighty hand of God that's a man God says the Pearl in my sight he's a man of great Christ why cuz pearls are rare me like that are rare sisters like that are rare but by God's grace and election he's predestinated son and he's so confident that predestiny to see Satan comes a guy and he'll say have you tried brother Robert are you following me have you tried my servants Wow because not because the flesh is so great but he knows my predestination what he's placed in that flesh now say T studies a man speaking propositional and that desired have thought that hunger for certain things is it every man this thing's that this little I like for the mic that's the wrong thing for preachers say but I'm being honest I like nice cars I don't plan to drive that in heaven my wife likes a nice houses I might not abort on one yet but she likes him it's not being wrong as I brother to say it we're liking certain things but we're never to let any of those things come between you and the will and programs of Almighty God even John wrote in his book I wouldn t prosper and be in health even as that soul prospers as long as you love God more then let the natural pace slow but if you don't know God's you might not need them cuz you won't be able to handle them Oh Stevie love God you got a big house man maybe that's my problem I need to love to some more maybe I might get me a bigger house that I can give it a high shear off if matter of fate you got a big house because but but every man has that natural thing you wrestle with and a lot of times we won't tell nobody about it but is there or you follow me now I want you to watch this we all have that little something inside but as Christians we testify about a love for the Lord and I'm not saying hypocrites I'm to my real Christians people see that I see the life of the people that I'm looking at in front of me I'll say your testimony's how you going through good times bad times and how you still hold strong to your testimony why because you love the Lord what you see that is manifested and we talk about his birth we see that we manifest it and we pray and we desire briolette spiritual blessings why because that's what a Christian should do but beyond that there's something on the inside of all of us that Sam is looking at and he's making notes and he plans to use those notes or you follow me he studied Balaam he saw baylin's love for popularity he studied Sampson he saw SAMHSA's love for a woman Sampson I want you to catch this was raised for purpose his commission his purpose was to destroy the Philistines because God said they're my enemies because they're the enemy of my children I mention Israel and I want to now raise up a man that can destroy my enemies and my true sin me that Samson Dowler that man and you know SAMHSA's biggest stumbling block was the thing he was raised at the destroyed not just a woman a Philistine woman say no if I could get close as hard he'll not wait on my wife because he's in love with the thing he was raised in the destroy and this last day Pentecostal church was raised up as a lay-oh that she had Church the Pentecostal age and God raised him up to smash to nomination to the ground and what did they do they became a denomination they failed to the very thing they were raised up to destroy I want you to watch this then you got Judas Satan wise Judas he saw in Judas when he would take up the offerings he put some of the money back he put some of his bag he put some of the money back he was humming his bad sayings that know how to work on this one he likes money so when it came time to use him he knew how to approach him he said Gollum any and you are from 24 30 pieces of silver and he'll be glad to take your proposition he knew the man Satan knows us better than perhaps we think but I want you to watch this but these men had a purpose and you and I were created for purpose but we should never let I desire come between us and that perfect brother branham talked about I raised up for a purpose his purpose was to be a delivery and then at a time of his ministry Moses went about it the wrong way it wasn't that he misunderstood his purpose he wouldn't about it wrong brother BAM said the mistake he had was not that it wasn't the time not that he wasn't the man he said but he left God out of it Moses went to deliver his people by education and not by revelation and not by the anointing of the Holy Ghost he thought what he had learned in Egypt was sufficient to bring me out what he thought he wanted to do which the bring his people out and so he tried to take that military knowledge and demonstrate it and it didn't persuade the people and leave it affect these Egypt one big Wow because God never intended for Moses to be glorified God said Moses I want to be glorified I said I will bring them out with a might have him not to Moses now say temptation you and I on it's our is he wants you and out of faith somehow letter you got a part in it something you can do the hedge or something God means from you and our debris is where the pass but what God needs is a surrender heart hum of his hand and said God you promised it and I rest 100% on what you promised why did God wait 25 years to Abraham he didn't have to wait a day why 25 years sort of Abraham can learn and be a testimony it's not by you Abraham but I made the promise and throw your body be dance until your white baby dance that doesn't stop my promise one bit nothing sonicator so our confidence this message came to give you in that confidence who is the mighty one who is the mighty one and where is he according to my Bible it said he's my friend the Almighty God is my friend and what I need to talk to him these that's ready to hear and you know what he likes to talk about his promises Lord our reading of the day where you say I was losing my babbling you say I would listen to a tape and I heard you speak to that prophet and you say will you go back to him he likes that science has proven that there was a study done several years back it was on the cover of a magazine now remember because that's when I God healed my back and they would talk about having surgery on my spine and God hit my back I never had that pain again I never had that surgery and I couldn't even walk at the time I was so bad I had almost crawled about his office but I can run I could jump I would jump on a chair play crazy I could jump now why he touched me but listen the same weekend I was my follow-up visit the scheduled surgery the suddenly before there was a cover for a magazine that said the power prayer science had discovered the power of prayer science now not theologians and they did a study and they found out that when people came into the hospital of pray there was literally a light that could be seen through necks ray on the heads they laid hands upon the sick but they noticed this big difference in their study the Christians that sippar came in and offer prayer had very low margins of success but the Christians that came in off a prayer but quoted a promise with their prayer had much higher success rates why they weren't going and hoping when I heard Gaza Hill little hill this man but think Oh God said God you said I shall lay hands upon the sick and they shall recover God I'm doing this accordance of that word greater margin of success so are you pray know who you pray to and know what he likes to hear I want you to watch what you watch this Moses was a man is satan couldn't pay off because he knew his commission and his purpose Elijah was a man didn't pay off he knew his commission and his purpose I want you to watch this and then we find Jesus Christ he was a perfect man he was the man Satan could not pay off no matter what he offered him because Jesus Christ knew his commission and his purpose turn me to Hebrews chapter 10 I'm laying the foundation I'm gonna be long in my top right get to the price right it won't be long under the laying a foundation because I want to see some church do you already procured your people and when I finish I want to know one thing you are placed here for a purpose he was there for a purpose Moses was there for a purpose price is there for a purpose you're in here neighborly Abel you're here for a purpose Hebrews 10 one for the law having a shadow of good things to come and not the very image of those things can never know sacrifices which they offer here by year continually make the comers thereunto perfect for then they would not have ceased to be offered because that the ones of worse were once purged should have no more conscious of other Brown said desire of sins but in those sacrifices there is a remembrance again made of sins every year for it is not possible that the blood of goats and of bulls and of goats should take away sins wherefore when he cometh into the world he saith listen listen this now this is Christ speaking now when he comes into world sacrifice and offerings that would have not I want to bring us a new today the nominations ideas a man theological seminaries that would not God I'm not you not even looking for that your eyes don't even turn that direction listen listen but a body has now prepared me Christ understood God was looking for my body and he understood he was the body God had been looking for do you realize this morning you are a part of a body brother than I and that body is the body for 2,000 years God has been looking for do you recognize your day of visitation a [Music] certain hour of restoration watch this in burnt offerings of sacrifice of a scene that has no pleasure then said I'd look at Christ's words back to God knowing how to talk back to God no I come in the volume of the book it is written of me to do that we love Lord he knew he was the fullness of the book and he came to fulfill the fullness of the book you and I can't fulfill the fullness of the book for the brand said but you can't fulfill the word for your age and that's what God is looking for where you try to go to the cross and died for me and be accepted you try to go to Israel and preach behold Messiah is coming they'll never accept you but there is a part that can be accepted and it's departing to God a predestinated for your age you have to recognize your hour of visitation and recognize your our brother Mike is to be restored in our hour something in the church was lost just like the first Eve when God came down to the first e something had been lost but God had the ability to get it back and what Satan had to see that a normal Church God with his bride has the ability to get it back but you've got to know it's yours now won't you watch this he was the man Christ was a man would have commissioned in a purpose he had a purpose like Adam he had a purpose like he Eve had a purpose he had a purpose like Moses but Jesus Christ newest purpose and he knew that his call was by predestination not just gifted or you follow me Balaam was dead not just anointed Judas was dead once you watch this but by predestination by God Jesus Christ had a calling and a purpose in that calling to be fulfilled looking for the bam sentimental birth brains he said watch how it's were portrayed in Jacob watch how it was portrayed in Joseph exactly loved of his brother loved it was giving love of his father hated by his brother and without a cause he was spiritual could foretell things and interpret dreams he couldn't help being that now I want to get this to you I don't want this to go by you if you're predestinated don't worry about it you cannot help be what you are because God made you that God is not trying to predestinate you God isn't trying to get you to accept what you were predestinated for he turned down with shira destined to fall but in our restoration he's restored to us the revelation of what you have predestinated for and why he put you in this hour and not the person oh I love the big magnet and see Paul preached I love that badesti John the Baptist I have loved to be with the multitude when Jesus gave the fiction bread fishing fishing bread but brother Brown said but what a greater age this is what a greater age this is now once you watch he was spiritually he could foretell things and interpret dreams he could not help being that he was just born that he was predestinated to be that and once you watch this that predestination gave Joseph and Jacob a hunger that's what I'm getting to they had a Hunger the hunger wasn't for meat and drink because the New Testament said that the kingdom of God is not meat and drink their hunger was for something different when Jesus Christ said I hunger to do my father's will the disciple said is that because we have taken no bread Jesus I'm not talking about natural meat the pre decimated have a hunger to find and to do the will of the one that put him here Moses in the desert forty years and cannot forget that hunger or the cry of the people why the predestination was going to stay there until satisfied that hunger I want you to watch this it's a hunger it's not a natural predestination that's what Matthew 5:6 says blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness for they shall be filled Wow that hunger is a predestinated seed in you that's hungry for the word to be fulfilled and nobody can take your place brother Brown said you were chosen to fulfill that part of the word now I'm talking to you have you hungry if you're not hungry it's time to pray cuz I ain't satisfied I'm not I'm hungry I'm hungry for something here brother Mike I'm hungry for something a spoken word Tabernacle I'm hungry for something in living word Tabernacle I hope they don't get me stolen could God restore what we were Zeeland if you did are you following me I am NOT looking to see any lost but it's not my decision it's his I'm hungry for something it's for the promise of this age I be confirmed and it has not been confirmed that I layer to see a messenger he was confirmed but we're in a different age we're at different people called out for a different manifestation it was the one God pulled out of there but now he's gone who's going to finish the course working God found another one like that one could be sold surrender in his hand he could do in you sister he could do in you young man what he did in that one are you following me when God took most of the scene the Commission was not finished they were still a Joshua Commission to be confirmed but God needs a Joshua to confirm the Commission you do not have a Joshua he's the Holy Ghost and he's looking for somebody tougher fields on Commission but it's only for the hungry for it c'était by you all for nothing not a better job not more money not a pretty away not a better look at husband he can't buy you all for nothing because something in your heart is not satisfied you say God there's more the Holy Ghost to be received and I'll know it when I see it the message listening learning the message doesn't create the hunger I'm going to say this now listen but the hunger would drive you into prayer and desperation like it is real when they wanted to get out even they might enjoyed the leeks for a little while but they came a day where they didn't satisfied no more I might enjoy a nice call for a while my wife if I could give him one with Jordan nice house for a while they would never if your predestinated they were never satisfied brother man chrétien 2 meses thirst he said God put in every man to thirst to him but the elect has even a different thirst it's a hunger force of righteousness for the BAM said every man hungry for God many are called but there's a special hunger in the predestinated their chosen they're chosen to fulfill a particular function in the age in which they live and the Holy Ghost seeks those people out but the brandman said to make love with him or brood over them until he produces in them the thing that they were created for and every man does not have that seed to come under there brooding are you following me when the Holy Ghost brood over the earth you found pine trees table you're not a con trees table but why didn't the coal ash come up why didn't the pyrite come up there was no life in the pyrite of coal ash to come up but everything that had a life of God it came up as the Holy Ghost was bruton now I want you to watch I don't want to keep you much longer I'm gonna finish this talk let's go to Romans 8 Romans 8 we're in our restoration the Holy Ghost is brewed and he's causing the truth of God to hunger for hunger we want something more when we get what we want that more than our food now we're getting close we get we want what God has read it out pull so Satan has nothing else he can offer you your interest sister bridgetta I say out of get in touch I gotta get hold of him nothing else sister was satisfying are you following even Christ is going to cavalry he had another desire he was a man he said father if they be any other way brother BEM said he wasn't trying to bypass Calvary he said he just wasn't ready to depart yet he was really starting to enjoy the fellowship with his friends he said God would just give me a little bit more time my friends I go but give me a little bit more time he was a man there was something on earth that even Christ desired and it was fellowship with those that loved him he said but nevertheless not my will when you're willing to sacrifice the thing that's closer to your heart not my will but I will be done now you're ready to move it to your position I want you to watch this Romans 8:28 and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are the called according to his purpose that's what I'm getting that his purpose for whom he did foreknow he did also predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that's the word in their age that he might be the firstborn among many brethren moreover whom he did predestinate them he also called and whom he called them he also justified and whom he justified them he also glorified and what should we say to these things if God be for us who can be against us this call or this desire in the elect of God will not fail but because God predestined that it can't fail little brother branham send a message where the holy goes give him for he said on the road home listen now Ruth and Naomi on their road home one of the daughter-in-laws offer she says she would return back to her country to her Gaza to her church to her people there was something over his heart that even though she felt the right thing to do was to go in the oh me there was something in her heart she couldn't let go of so she turned back to the thing that meant more to her they contain Oh Naomi and I recognized the only was the one that held the rights to inheritance I want you to watch this and they only tried to get Ruth to go back but she said your people are my people your God is my God where you died they'll die where you buried I'll be buried I'll not turn back even the only couldn't insist that she go back because she recognized that she wanted to stay with the inheritance I'll stay with the word cuz that's where they inherit his lives let people go back and do the one I don't have no problem with that but as for me in my house I've got to stay where the inheritance in this mystery our and Harris with the adoption of the hour how do you know what hurts a dumbshit cuz I've already seen the first one that comes the fruit why didn't judge mistake emotional message he saw what it did for Moses he said if there's ever Moses I'll stay right here with it I'll stay right here with it it's an hour of restoration what is the restoration everything that Adam lost everything that evil off is now give it back to the church but you've got to know what the hour is and that you are predestinated for this hour you said brother Mike I'm weak Souls Abraham you said brother Mike I've done wrong so today you said brother Mike at times I just did the God to do something I did completely opposite so then Moses it's not by you don't work Church it's bad predestination well how do I'm not predestinated I'm actually this morning what does have to do what are you hungry for what is your heart cried out for if it's more God that means there's more God for you to receive but if you're satisfied you may have reached your limit let me finish your people be my people your God be my God where you die there I'll die where you buried there I'll be buried I'll not turn back but the Bram said that's when a person has caught a vision don't make any difference what her people say you're going over that become a holy roller or something he said that don't make any difference root there was a purpose of God listen Church this is my message there's a purpose of God to be fulfilled you know Isaiah 55 is on the line it's on the line right now God's obligated that promise do you realize it features 4 is on the line right now God's eye hidden there's got to be some mad without spot or wrinkle God a promise that he can't take it back you know Ephesians chapter 1 is on the line right now there'll be a bride that'll be the fullness of him that's this age that's on the line right now I'm trying to show you what the promise of the age is and how God has trusted you to carry this promise across the line the Holy Ghost in you will take this promise wrapped across the line he doesn't want our works he want our faith when Christ is about to the Father he is say should I find a church that I return he just aged about 5,000 when I returned he didn't say well I find it open of the seals and I returned he said when I come can I find one man that has the revelation the faith of the age in which he's living shall I find faith I'm saying God help me help me know what you say it and then let me know it applied to me come once that revelation strikes your heart the devil hills can raise all they want but I got a promise it'll never prevail against it now listen there's a purpose of God to be fulfilled and just as sure as you're hungry tonight for the Holy Ghost is something in you pulling you that a purpose of God in your life has got to be fulfilled just like it was in Ruth now I've gone along and I'm home to preach I'm on shotgun this end of it I want you to get the point we got to go beyond church we got beyond fetch it or you follow me and I'm not trying to backtrack on brother John's comments because he's right we need a pastor I don't have a problem with those comments those comments are true and brother Steven very rarely to me I don't see another than I miss raising his hand saying huh I'm call or you follow me or what I'm saying is this if we get locked down in church we got to plant potatoes so we need to keep my eyes on church plants and potatoes hit you trustees get your Deacons get you past it but don't lose the purpose God is not coming for no more local assembly you can have the pass order you can have everything in place and the heart is not caught the vision for the Aged lie truth had and know what your eyes are set on not a purpose in which you hungry for if you ain't called that the church will do you no good but give you a place to go on Sunday I'm not looking for a place to be on Sunday I'm looking for a place to be about 6 to 9 in the morning when that voice says come up hither and I hear it and I said Lord I've been waiting I've been waiting and when I hear that voice I looked out of my hand they're different

purpose and God did not make you and I just to see if he could do it he made us for a purpose therefore there is a purpose of all of us in here they are not here just to be another human you're not

brooding over you find time talk to it be like Samuel when Samuel said a servant is here speak Lord there was a voice already waiting to speak back and brother Bram said it changed Samuels of life he

a few minutes just give me your undivided attention for a minute now Colossians the 4:18 chapter in the book of Colossians here now he is the head of the church the body now remember an ease hour of restoration God had to turn her heart back to Adam who he made her headship that was her our restoration now in this hour the church in the first age the Bible said lost her first love which was her headship for a short period of time Christ actually had preeminence in his Gentile church but before the first age was concluded not necessarily in Paul's and Peter time for the BAM said because the age lasted beyond their lifespan but maybe beyond beyond beyond their life till the first age he said the church began to cool off and relax just a little bit but come for more what was it and God rebuked him and said ye have left your first love which means somewhere down the line God's got to take that bride and bring her back to the original faith original one-on-one with God that she had is there Pentecost where no man would come and join themselves to them because God was being glorified in his church and brother Brown said and I'm looking for those days of Ananias and Sapphira God to manifest like that to come back again and that will come into full hour of restoration but not what he says for the Benham reason description now here's the head of the church the body who was the beginning the first born of dead that in all things he might have preeminence preeminence where in his church he is the hand of the turn that his brother Brent non-scripted now this is him saying he is the head of the church which is the body and he wants the preeminence I make my confession one of the things that I don't pray about as much tissue it but it comes with my heart from time to time it's keep waving love the Lord with all that hard all that soul but all not man with all that's trending if a man surrenders death what else for the robber does he have loved the Lord that dark with all that heart all that soul all that man everything you think about and all that strength everything you've got in this body what else we have with a climber what does we got God has all of you what can God do with a man if he can get all them little David I believe he can show Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever Morita's quote I've got a few more allows him let you go he says listen now listen close why we're going what he is to be the head of the body his Brides body which is taken from him flesh and bone like in Adam see Bride God has a purpose tip of field like Adams give me late Adam and his bride the same way God took out of Adam his bride you and I have come out of Christ his bride she left what was brought back the bride left but in this age the word has brought her back that's what we're hungry for but we got to recognize the hour of our restoration and I prayed that the hunger the greatest hunger that any of you have right now is to find your place in that restoration don't struggle with your ability say God give me a revelation of what you've given in my place in it and then you rest on what he promised you Lou when Ruth was an hour for restoration all she did listen Church them frozen was X go back and read a book a roof you find what she did anything more she asked when she went to Boaz and laid at his feet and she made her petitions known he looked down at him and he said I'll be back and she wouldn't old hope mother-in-law what had happened and and they said don't worry the mail not rest there's not an eye on you no more here not rest until the job is done that's the bride's confidence let's bow our heads let's bow our heads dear Heavenly Father I want to thank you for your grace thank you for your word I want to thank you for this people that have gathered Lord together and your name we come from different parts of the state from different states birth homes of different countries even for God that's something bringing us together we have a common hunger we want more of you and law other sex lesson citizen know how forgive each of us forgive me you know what kind of effect the world can have on a man and you even told us by your prophet that a man is not capable of keeping a covenant so you wouldn't put your trust even in that the Lord you gave each one of us an unconditional covenant a promise that put our name on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world and you promise that they'll be not one of those that have been lost and to ensure it's you sent your word to bring us back what I'm the God made a Holy Ghost right now proved no I'm a you move back to darkness like you did in Genesis I mean you moved back to unbelief of this age when you move back to temptations and Satan's trying to put each one of us that caused us to turn our minds and our hearts to different things that are not ordained according to your will God may you purify our hearts may you open up all our confusion of our mind and get us off of the drunken things that it's like Lord that your word might be able to shine in our hearts and Lord that you might be glorified in us God give us such a sweet anointing that we go into presence of sinners they have to act different because they recognize the atmosphere has changed it's not our tone of voice but God as the spirit that's moving with us and in us and around us God let this world be so impacted O God by your presence in us Lord that they'll recognize that Jesus Christ is still alive law you did it you your own body me you here on earth you did it in Peter and Paul Lord even did it with Churches Reformers or God that has such an influence in their age that people Oh God just honored the lives that they lived how much more in this hour God when your fullness of your word is coming forth Lord you're more than able even now to do this through these people I'm maxing God once again lord help us to catch the vision help us to see why you called us out help us and know what's about to take place any day now Coronas trying to distract us Lord what is controlling in our presence lord I the president miss his orders are trying to distract even his country and other leaders around the world who God dictators or God threatening Christians that they would see even your words being mentioned in their countries God may you bless your bride around this world may you bless the bride wherever your name is being called wherever there's a seed of God may your Holy Spirit find them Oh God and may you minister to them as only you can and God may you bring your word to pass in their miss Lord we thank you Lord I commit the rest of the service into your hands we actually grace in all things in Jesus Christ's name Amen there's a new desire prayer before we dismiss for return of service or keep playing music please as enters our prayer God's here God's not here just to preach the word he's here to confirm the word with signs following and if he desires to do that we want to give him that opportunity when they give us a song his inner desire anything dalton's open Altis open somebody will give us a song anybody feeling of Johnny want to come meet us a song please [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] now flows through my veins of the team praise God are you a child of the king Amen have you caught the vision for this our men are you a child of the king I mean are you a recipient of the life of God a man that has been passed in this hour praise God you know I was just teaching my family a little bit last night about you know just the importance of the message and you know I'm not gonna get into all of it I'm like along the time but you know just what brother Mike said this morning was was very powerful very good he made a lot of good statements in it you know to the family I was like it sometimes it's like you know two different seeds right one seed they both look exactly alike on the outside you can't tell any difference but one of them has life in it and the other one is just a dead seed a man and so that's well so much of the time we get caught up in the word that the Lord gave me was symbol it's we get caught up in the semblance of the message the outward appearance of the message but yet we fail to recognize the reality we fail to recognize the life that God is fraught and that is the message amen the opening of the Seventh Seal all these things immense that is the message to the bride have you been a
