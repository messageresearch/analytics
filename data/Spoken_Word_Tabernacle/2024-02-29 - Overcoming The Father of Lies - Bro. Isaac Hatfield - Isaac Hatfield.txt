went off and started fellowshipping with the Saints so when we were done I know I had them waiting on me so I just ran to the car and sat down and oblivious to the fact that my stuff were in the car with me but then I noticed yeah my bag is here okay no problem so we're driving um I don't know if anybody knows where web restaurant is but we were heading there and uh as we were driving along we met brother Steven so he was driving parallel to us and we're just waving at each other so as we we got to probably the third traffic light he shook his phone to to show us that he's trying to call us so I was like okay I'm looking for my phone I was like wait a minute where is my phone my bag is here my scarf is there my coat my phone was on top the car and I'm like Lord have mercy the phone and the iPad was on top of the car now brother blesson thank the Lord for him he took my bag and put it in the car so he said yes yob bet I put everything in the car I was like all right no problem so brother Stephen we W down the window I was like I can't find my phone so uh we panicked a little bit the then a piece just came over me and I said Lord the amount of Curves and turns we have made that phone is definitely not there that iPad is smashed but Lord we will find it so I told B Stephen don't worry we'll find the phone so they're thinking in the car now we need to turn back and go back to the church and see if we find a phone I said no I left that phone on top of the car it will be on top of the car so I remember jusa she like she suddenly stopped and the stuff in the back just slid forward and all of that is coming to my mind like it's gone but something again said yoked you said it's up there it's going to be up there as we parked up I got out the car and Saints just laying nice and flat not even move an inch it was perfectly on top the car I just let a scream of thanks to God because I knew that that that was impossible but the BL amen amen amen thank God for [Music]

where was that singing on Sunday where was the song on Sunday so you need to sing it again on Sunday do you agree with me so you heard the congregation blessed be the name of the Lord he's not the god of brother brandham only he is my God also he is the god of the message and where the message is that's where the pillar of fire is where the Ark of the Covenant is that's where the pillar of fire is and the Ark of the Covenant is the word if you put the word in your heart then God is going to be in your heart and wherever God is you're blessed that's right amen so remember the last request of Joseph get me out of prison God don't want to be in the prison of our mind in the prison of our theology in the prison of our thinking our intellectual knowledge or any kind of prison or any Doctrine or anything let God Be Free amen do you know that Jesus said that except the corn of we falling to the ground he does what so as long as God was confined in Jesus Christ there is no much he can do because he can do everything only in one individual but when God was coming out of the Lord Jesus Christ and came back on the day of Pentecost then we have 120 jesuses now God can work more now think about the end time prde where not only the fullness of the god word but the fullness of the word has been open up we must see God in our life amen and do you know today is February the 28th have you thought about it it's even here I have two pictures I have one here and I have another one there amen February the 28th and he fell on Wednesday so somehow God is going to do something special for us tonight amen amen glory to God today we have a special family member he never been here before so this is his first time visiting flying all the way from from Ohio down here brother Isaac had filed if you know brother Wayne lson this is Brother way in-law son son-in-law so we tried to get him the first time it didn't work out and this time the Lord open up the way so he can be here I told him you home you go ahead and you preach like home and behave like home and we also will pull like home and we're going to hear from Heaven tonight amen amen so let's go with forever only believe oh [Music] oh believe oh [Music] believe all things are possible only believe oh believe oh believe all things are [Music] possible [Music] all I Lord [Music] I all things are [Music] possible [Music] Lord Lord I believe Lord I [Music] all things [Music] are amen is that your testimony amen we're Believers so we believe amen that's just what we do amen it's an honor and a privilege to be in the house of the Lord with each one of you this evening we just appreciate the opportunity your pastor has extended to us and uh we've heard such good things um from Brother Wayne and he sends his special greetings to you all he sure loves being with you and speaks very highly of you and so it's putting excitement in our heart to be here and we're just sorry my wife and baby couldn't be here this time but Lord will in one time we'll get to bring him down and but just getting over some sickness and things so we left him home but they uh they sure would have loved to be here amen are you happy to be in the house of the Lord amen if you have your Bibles we'll go straight to the word have a couple of texts but we'll start in the Book of John chapter 8 and take a take a reading out of John chapter 8 amen we'll start in verse 3 2 amen and we'll read through 47 it said and ye shall know the truth yes sir and the truth shall make you free amen and they answered him we be Abraham's seed and were never in bondage to any man how sayest thou you shall be made free but Jesus answered them verily verily I say unto you whosoever committeth sin is the servant of sin and the servant abideth not in the house forever but the son abideth ever if the son therefore shall make you free you shall be free indeed and I know that you are Abraham's seed but you seek to kill me because my word hath no place in you I speak that which I have seen with my father and ye do that which you have seen with your father they answered and said unto him Abraham is Our Father and Jesus saith unto them if you are Abraham children ye would do the works of Abraham yes sir but now you seek to kill me a man that ha told you the truth which I have heard of God this did not Abraham ye do the Deeds of your father then said they unto him we be not born of fornication we have one father even God Jesus said unto them if God were your father you would love me for I proceeded forth and came from God neither came I of myself but he sent me why do you not understand my speech even because you cannot hear my word but ye are of your father the devil and the lust of your father ye will do he was a murderer from the beginning and a bow not in the truth because there is no truth in him when he speaketh a lie he speaketh of his own for he is a liar and the father of it and because I tell you the truth you believe me not which of you convince me of sin and I say if I say the truth why do you not believe me he that is of God heareth God's words ye therefore hear them not because ye are not of God and me one more short reading out of Ephesians 4 amen verse 20 down to 27 and then we'll be seated amen do you love the Lord amen amen it says but ye have not so learn Christ if so be that you have heard him and have been taught by him as the truth is in Jesus that you put put off concerning the former conversation the old man which is corrupt according to the deceitful lust and be renew renewed in the spirit of your mind and that you put on the new man which after God is created in righteousness and true Holiness wherefore putting away lying speak every man truth with his neighbor for we are members one of another be ye angry and sin not let not the son go down upon your wrath and neither give place to the devil amen if we could just bow our heads for word of prayer Lord we just thank you Lord for the opportunity to be in the house of God this evening father we don't want to take it for granted Lord any moment that you give us to be together father and gather around this revealed word Lord and Lord it means so much to us that you saw fit father to open our eyes to see this word and Lord to to fellowship with Believers of like Precious faith in this dark hour and we ask Lord that you pour out a special blessing upon each one father that made it out to the house of the Lord tonight and father those that couldn't make it maybe at home streaming father may you just go by their way and encourage them and strengthen them Father we just Commit This service into your hands father knowing that we have no ability of our own and just asking that you have your way in Jesus name amen you may have your seats if we could just take a text out of those scriptures tonight on overcoming the father of Lies o overcoming the father of Lies I mean and I think that's something that we can all agree upon tonight is that Satan is a liar amen he's a liar and he's the father of Lies am me in the church age book it says this is a fact Satan is a liar and the father of lies and and he's also a murderer and we see that expressed in in how brother Brandon would teach us that that false Vine always persecutes that True Vine how Cain would persecute Abel and Esau and Jacob but but he's not just a murderer in the natural but in the spiritual he's a murderer and he sent his doctrines into the Earth such as the Trinity and brother Brandon would say it's how it's murdered many and it's killed many and destroyed many lives not through natural death so much but as through spiritual death Satan has sent his lies and his doctrines into the churches and destroyed lives and murdered many uh innocent victims but but but that's what Satan does he goes about to steal and to kill and destroy and he's a he's a deceiver and and the Very definition of a lie would be to make an ontrue statement with intent to deceive so that's what Satan is he goes about as a deceiver and we shouldn't be surprised because it's already been prophesied in this last day that there would be false Christ and they would go about doing great signs and wers under a religious cloak but it's Satan and going about to deceive the true bride of Christ but he cannot do it because there's something different about them but Satan goes about as a liar and as the father of Lies seeking whom he may destroy uh and he goes about uh uh uh setting in a church pew and brother Brandon would say you know he wouldn't be a deceiver if he wasn't religious if he didn't go to church and dress like church then he wouldn't be a deceiver but that's what makes him a deceiver as he puts on that that religious spirit which brother brandom said is the worst spirit that there is five times worse than any other spirit that dresses himself up and and brother brand say how how they would come to the Altar and and maybe uh uh put on a a certain uh uh form or show but really they have no love for the Lord they have no intention to serve the Lord they have no order in their lives they get up just the same as they came down amen and and it could have been a good thing but they were deceived in their exper experience and brother BR said sometimes they get a church Spirit instead of God's spirit and what a deception of the devil to to to bring someone all the way into a church building all the way to an altar and not let them Reach the reality of the Holy Ghost but they get up with nothing but a church Spirit but there is a holy spirit there is the spirit of Christ and there's no comparison between God's spirit and this church Spirit but God's spirit will make you different brother God's spirit will come in and change you from the inside out it won't just be putting on the uh the garments putting the skirts past your knees and a set of rules and regulations it'll be a living reality where the king of glory condescends into your heart and reveals this message in your life and shows you what it's all about shows you where you came from shows you where you're going amen it's not a church Spirit you've got to come into the spirit of Christ amen but that's Satan's tactic amen and even in John 8 he's speaking this scripture to Pharisees a religious group of peopleall saying you are of your father the devil but he's a liar that's and how do you know he's lying brother Steven because his lips are moving and I don't think that's a quote from brother Brandon but I think it holds true because we just read in John 8 that there is no truth in him so if there's no truth in him and his lips are moving you know it's coming out as a lie and the thing is just to be able to discern who's talking to you is that right because if you can discern the voice that you're hearing and you can separate whether it's the lie or the truth then you can have dominion over the devil in your life and realize no that's not the truth that's a lie and I don't have to be be subject to it amen for that's the negative side Hallelujah but what about the positive side Paul told us in the book of Titus Paul a servant of God and Apostle of Jesus Christ according to the faith of God's elect and the acknowledging of the truth which is after godliness and hope of eternal life which God that cannot lie promised before the world began he said I am the way I am the truth I am the life and if the Satan is the father of lies and there's no truth in him here the scriptures telling us that there is one that dwells in truth and truth alone there is no lie in him and so when God speaks you know it's coming from the Throne of God it's the word of God and it cannot fail brother when God speaks it's forever when God speaks it's got to come to pass when God speaks all hell moves and it's as good as done and brother opposition brother friend with tell us means nothing when God speaks amen Moses might have just had a staff he might have just been riding into Egypt on the mule but he had something on his side he had the word of the Lord and when you have the word of the Lord on your side brother opposition doesn't mean a thing there is no obstacle there is no sickness there is no habit there is nothing too hard for the Lord when he once speaks a word over your life it is finished it's nothing but the truth and it'll hold it'll hold you in the hour of trouble amen however you came in tonight am me whatever you're dealing with yes sir it doesn't mean a thing when the word of the Lord yes sir strikes your heart it's a finished thing brother brother Brandon would say God's word would mean more in the next few minutes than anything he could speak because I'm a man and I could speak and I could tell a story and and you might believe it or not believe it but when God speaks it's settled when God speaks you can anchor your soul in that word amen amen amen amen hallelujah yes my brother and so we want the word of the Lord tonight yes my brother if you can just identify for you see Satan he's a perverter he's not a Creator he has no ability to create the way God can but all he can do is pervert that's right and so if God can speak the truth and Satan cannot speak that truth so what's he going to do he's going to take that truth and mistell it and then it becomes a lie he takes the truth of God and just and just perverts it and then it's it's just a little bit mold that's right and so there's going to be one of the two forces control us tonight it be the power of God or the power of the devil and so what are you going to yield yourself to is what will make the difference in how you leave the service this evening for already as you come come in there's different voices going on in your head and and and the devil's trying to bring one voice to to get you to leave the same way as you came and to get you get you to disbelieve the word of God but there's another voice the voice of the word that's trying to get you to come up higher trying to get you to believe for all things to believe for your healing to believe for your children to believe for your deliverance yes my brother Hallelujah yes my brother help him Lord heyen you have to forgive my voice PR amen and but but but if you're wondering what's the truth over your situation and you come to the house of God and you're hearing these voices in your head and you say what is the truth over my life and you know that somebody maybe you got a friend sometimes that that tells stories and they have a little bit of an ability to uh uh maybe if they go fishing the fish is always a little bit bigger than it really was and it's always a little bit different a little bit more exagger gerated just a little bit mold and so if you come to a serious situation and you ask that friend you're maybe going to wonder well is that the truth or is that a little bit mold and so it matters who you consult about your situation and what I appreciate about that is that one time David uh he was trying to do God a service and he consulted the captains of hundreds and thousands about how to get this Ark back into its right position and and they did it the way of the captains of hundreds and thousands and they lost the life of a man and it wasn't the will of God although although it was a good thing but it was trying to do God a service outside of his will and brother renom said there stood a Vindicated Prophet by the name of Nathan in the land and he wasn't even consulted amen but I believe we should go back to Consulting the Vindicated Prophet about the situation and if the devil tells you you're not going to make it you say no devil I know how you tell your stories they're always a little bit mold but I'm going to consult the message on this one and the message says I already made it the message says I'm already healed the message says I'm delivered the message says I'm a Son of God and I came from God and I don't have to Knuck down to the lies of the devil I don't have to bow down to any lie amen God's word is already declared victory over my life and it's a finished work come back to the absolute of this word come back to the truth and put a stake down and say it is finished it's a finished work Calvary paid the price the blood was shed the Holy Ghost is mine I can receive it before I ever leave this building I don't have to knck down to any lie any Spirit there is a law of Life flowing through my veins that says Amen to the word of God Amen God will perform what he's spoken amen he's The God Who performs amen if he spoke it he's able to perform it you don't have to worry about it you don't have to try to work it up God's word will manifest when it comes into the right ground amen but Satan hates it Satan hates that Revelation man and brother brandom told us that a very familiar quote he says exposes Satan and it Reveals His works the attempted destruction of God's people and the discrediting of God's word you all know where I'm at don't you right down to the time he's cast in the Lake of Fire he fights that he cannot stand it he knows that if the people get the true revelation of the true church how many is the true church tonight amen and what she is and what she stands for and that she can do the greater work she will be an invincible Army so here you got to discern he said if you can get a true revelation of the two Spirits within the framework of the Christian church and try God's by God's spirit yes sir discern and withstand the Antichrist Spirit Satan will be powerless before her amen and and that means something to me because I just been thinking a little bit on it it should be so easy to believe God's word that's right uh it should be so easy that if God said that heavens and earth shall pass away but my word shall never pass away and brother Brandon even preached a sermon on the infallibility of God spoken word and I was just thinking if if the word is infallible and I know it is then then then it should be so easy that if God can't lie that we should just believe his word amen and brother BR said if you could ever get it settled in your mind what that word really is then it would be settled he said you wouldn't have to he said you he said what that really is if you could ever get settled in your mind with that spoken word he said we not need any healing service our Salvation altar call because it would be finished if you just realize what that word was not that he was doing away with those things but he's just saying if you could really realize the reality of this word that you are already healed you are already delivered then it would be finished the moment you could ever realize the reality of that word that it's a finished work that it's INF it's infallible hallu that no matter if you see it today tomorrow the next day you're anchored right there in that word he said healing become simple why because it comes through a Perfection it comes through a perfect Channel it comes from God himself and it's already spoken and it can't be a mistake God doesn't take any word back for a mistake brother and when God spoke that the lamb would be slain before the foundation of the world brother there's not enough devils in hell that could keep him from dying on that cross because it was already spoken oh but don't stop there because when he wrote his name on that book he wrote my name with his and just as sure as there's not enough devils in hell that could keep him from dying on the cross there's not enough devils in hell that can keep me from fulfilling the promises spoke over my life oh because I'm a spoken word brother I'm already spoken for I'm already claimed by the blood of Jesus Christ my name is on the book before the devil could ever get to my life God already claimed me for the message of the hour and I say be it unto me Lord I don't want none of the lies of the devil give me that word over my life oh wash our minds Lord wash our minds of the filth of this world wash our minds of the perversion and the deception and give us a clean Channel Hallelujah let it settle in our hearts that it's a finished work his word will not return void and when he once speaks a word oh it's on its way it'll prosper in the thing you sent it to do and if you're a word of God you may have come in tonight dragging your feet feeling like you're withering but if you're a word of God you're not withering brother you're prospering you came from God you're on your way back to God oh don't worry about the finances don't worry about what your eyes see brother Brandon said time Insight are two of the worst enemies God has because they don't declare anything about God but if you could ever get back to the plum line of this word brother it's smooth sailing you're prospering oh because you're a word of God and you won't return void but you'll manifest that attribute of God hallelujah let the word settle your hearts tonight that it's a finished work oh Satan hates it but we love it we love this Revelation Hallelujah you got to let that truth be your guard let that truth be your protection oh you're in the greatest battle ever fought you come into church tonight and you're in a battle a battle between right and wrong a battle between truth and the lie but God's given you a word to be your guard glory to God Amen and brother if you can recognize that it's a lie you can take the devil back to that word and say Satan it wasn't so from the beginning because if God promised it in the beginning and Satan says sure that's that's about right except it's for a days gone by then that's a thief that's come to steal and kill and Rob you of your god-given privileges anything contrary to God's word it's a thief and it's come to rob you it's come to destroy you oh but you can let this word be your card amen I like what brother Brandon teaches us yes on the baptism in the name of the father Son and Holy Ghost how it was the same name how it wasn't titles like they taught it that it was three different people but it was three different offices and brother Brandon would say that there stood Matthew there as a guard for that sacred baptism that we didn't have to wonder about it but there was the answer laying there in Matthew as a guard and and brother talked about how he put those four powers of the line and the ox the man amen and the eagle to guard the Acts of the Apostles there were those gospels that stood as guard brother amen and that truth can be your guard you take this word and when Satan comes in brother you're guarded you can stand there and say no no he said you're going to go you're going to go to a grave and you're never going to come up but God already promised us that there would be a resurrection that there would be a Rapture and we guarded by that word all Satan's lies have no penetration because it's the word amen but it's the greatest battle ever fought but it's fought in the mind and why is it fought in the mind because that's where decisions are made brother and so Satan chose that mind but Joshua could say choose you this day who you will serve will you serve the gods or those on the other side of the flood or will you Ser serve the true and living God those choices are made every day yes sir where you accept doubt or faith and brother Brandon said Satan began at the principal part that caused the spirit of man to doubt God's word but God began in the principal part to lay his word in that spirit amen do you see the Warfare happening even now Satan's there laying in that lie laying in that lie but God's got a word that's being laid in and laid in and choose you this day will you put the word first or will you put the LIE of the enemy first but as for me in my house we choose the word of the lord we choose this truth of the hour oh he'll try to come in through your five senses of imagination conscience and and memory and you think I'm not good enough I I'll never make it and you begin to reason that maybe it's not for me maybe uh maybe uh I've made too many mistakes and I've fallen too many times and and Satan begins to work on those things but you're not alone if I could just share brother brandom had us had had had those same battles how Satan would attack his mind right and he would tell about how one time he was driving down the road and he was listening to a broadcast and the way he describes it it was uh as if they were talking about something kind of like Evolution and he said there is no such thing and he begins to talk about it he said but Satan was trying to punch that at me and after I had taken my little Rebecca to school this morning and on the road back I started to turn the radio on again and I thought I would get into that stuff again so I just turned it back off there's a big key over coming right there just turn it back off I tell my brother oh don't stop for the devil just turn it back off don't give the devil a place neither give a place to the devil don't give him room to even come into your mind oh but he said Satan said to me he said do you know this man that you call Jesus was just a man like one day in his day like Billy Graham or Oral Roberts he was just a man and Satan begins to lay this lie into his conscience but brother Bram said I thought how a liar you are he said and then I turned just as I was crossing Graham Street I said Satan you that's talking to my conscience see how that Devil's coming in through that sense he said I like to ask you a few things who was it that the Hebrew Prophet spoke of that would come who was the anointed Messiah what was upon those men who fora him and told his life thousands of years before he got here who was it that foretold it just to the letter and he begins to combat that Devil with the word and brother said you might as well just get away from it because it's written in the word and every word is true then he left just give him the word that doesn't he can't stand that word for it's inspired and brother Paul taught us to think on these things that negative thought comes in that says you're too far gone you're never going to make it that it couldn't possibly be you brother you can't stop that bird from flying over but you can't stop it from building a nest you take that word and you blast it away and said no Satan you're a liar it is for me and brother you're supposed to cast down imaginations and cast down everything that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God God and you don't have to be a slave to that lie anymore cast it down am mean everything that exalteth itself against the knowledge of God glory and When God says I know the thoughts I think towards you thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected end you going to take the knowledge of God or you going to take the LIE of the devil did you come from God does he have good thoughts towards you does he know you as his son does he know you as his child then what are you going to believe when the the Devil comes in and tells you it's not so oh but brother think on these things cast down imaginations oh brother brother Brandon was in South Africa one time and there was a mighty Miracle took place with a boy who was under a a mental spirit that was causing them to be on all fours like an animal but God delivered them and brother Brandon made a call for salvation he said you who are tired of serving those Idols why don't you throw them down on the ground he said it was like a dust storm where 30,000 raw heathens cast down their idols and you say well I don't have any Idols in my life but brother Brenham said anything between you and God is an idol amen and every thought that exalteth itself between you and God it's an idol and you have a right tonight to cast it down and you don't have to live with it anymore it's an idol and what agreement have the temple of God with Idols you are the Temple of the Living God you are not a temple for the 's Idols you are not a temple for those things which would get between you and you and God my brother said come out from among them and be ye separate touch not the unclean thing and I will receive you you're a separated people you've been called come out of her my people come out of denominations oh and I don't care if you sit in a message church that's not what I'm talking about come out of the denominational mentality that you're a slave to some system and it's just rules and regulations if I don't wear my skirt so long if I don't speak in tongues I don't have the Holy Ghost God has called us to a liberty this message is our Liberty this message is our truth don't bring your denominational chains into this message Hallelujah said this is the word now and if it doesn't agree with the word throw it out brother am cast It Down cast down that imagination cast it down and come out from among them yes my brother oh you don't have to be a slave to it hallelujah hallelujah oh anything that exalted against the knowledge of God it's a lie preach my brother preach come out of her Hallelujah my people this is the word now amen and you should let God's word be true amen amen and every man yes sir a liar a you don't have to be captive Hallelujah bring it under captivity to the word oh praise God you have the message amen don't stop amen don't stop as Eve would stop for a moment but but we're under a commission like Joshua don't turn to the right or the left hallelujah oh keep that word of the Lord in your mouth Joshua he didn't just say keep it in his hand or or keep it on his lap but he said keep it in your mouth don't let it ever depart from your mouth don't let that word ever depart from your mouth but may it always be on display amen amen amen always be What comes forth from your lips brother don't stop for a moment as brother Brandon would give the example of Nelly Sanders stopping to turn over to that that dance hall and he said that's where she made her mistake thinking that it wouldn't bother anymore but it did bother her and she shouldn't have stopped that's right but brother BR said don't stop for nothing you've got the message Jesus Lives God Is A Healer that's the message don't stop for nothing no reasonings no nothing else and brother Brandon would preach the message recognizing your day and its message yes my brother and he said you know I had so much trouble getting the inspiration for the service and and it just wouldn't come and then when it finally started coming he said Satan would tell me you feel too bad your head's hurting you're sick and and you can't go down there you can't stand there and and brother Brandon began to recite the story of that little cocky boy from England he said I've got an Urgent Message and I need you to take it and I'm going to give you my scepter and to show you that that you're the king's messenger carrying a Vindicated word and brother BR said I thought Satan get out of my way I have the king's message I must go and then he talks about Jesus Christ raising from the dead as the Prince of Peace coming forth with the Declaration I am the king's message I must come forth to prove this Resurrection I am the resurrection of in life am amen and when God gives you the this message brother don't stop don't turn to the right or the left don't stop for nothing don't stop for any other voice don't stop for any other opinion brother you have the message move forward don't stop don't turn to the right or the left but we're going forward and we're going upward and it's becoming of you to fulfill our righteousness brother it's becoming of you to stand for this word it's becoming of you now in the time of difficulty to stand and fulfill this word man when brother Brandon preached that service it becometh us to fulfill our righteousness it got a call that his mother was was close to death in the hospital a and how a hard thing that would be can you imagine but he said but here is a message that's got to go on lord it's becoming to us it's becoming to me now that I fulfill all righteousness God's word comes first and then down he said Lord and as your servant I charge this devil that's pushed at me all morning that's tried to make me get out of this Pulpit by the grace of God I stayed here for these poor sick and suffering Mortals amen and how the devil will come and how he'll try to use difficulties to push you out of your position to try to push you out of your position as a pastor as the Deacon as the lay member he'll come with difficulty and try to push you out but it's becoming of you to fulfill all righteousness it's not becoming of you to to lay it down and say well maybe it wasn't meant for me in the first place no it's becoming of you to fulfill the word it's becoming of you to stand the message must go on and who's it going to go on through if we all throw down the road because of a little difficulty God's equipped us with the word to move forward don't stop don't stop for nothing press the battle am it's becoming of you to stand for something and if you don't stand for something you'll fall for anything exactly so why don't you stand for something why don't you stand for the message why don't you stand for the move of God why don't you stand for Divine Healing in the power of the Holy Ghost I stand for this message because I'm identified with it everything it is I'm identified with and I stand for it and if I fall I stand for a blood that's got enough power to cleanse me and put me back on my feet and say go on press the battle amen oh it's becoming of you yes sir oh but don't worry about the difficulties uhhuh brother Brenham came back and preached the comforter and brother Bram said my mother may not know it but God kept her alive while I was preaching and you think that God's forgotten you while you're standing but no if you stand for him he'll stand for you he'll take care of the issues he'll take care of you he'll take care of your family he'll take care of everything you forsaken for this gospel and many of you have forsaken probably houses and lands and mothers and fathers but God will repay you a thousandfold what you forsaken for this Kingdom he will not be debed to any man so if you forsake it and stand for this word it'll stand for you it'll keep you in the hour of trouble it'll hold you brother it works for your children it works for your marriage it works for the difficulties and the frictions that come in this message will work for it'll work for your loved ones oh it'll work for my wife and baby back home I may to leave them but God hasn't left them he said I'll never leave you nor forsake you just stand brother it's becoming of you to stand having done all stand stand therefore with your loin SC about what trth in the breastplate of righteousness on your chest oh don't lay it down don't lay down the armor stand yes S stand for this word and let it stand for you oh like Danny Henry he did he wasn't perfect but he stood for me on Earth and I'll stand for him here in heaven that's what I want brother I don't have to have a lot of uh a lot of uh good things here on this Earth but just give me this message and let me stand for it that on that day almighty God will say oh he wasn't ashamed of my word he stood for it and I'll stand for him my brother I'll stand for this truth don't stop neither give place to the devil oh that's the problem we make too many homes for the devil oh someone preach my someone says something to you someone says something that gets a little bit on your nerves brother and all of a sudden you you get out your best comforter you get out your best bed your best pillows and you say here's a nice place for you and you let a little bitterness become a great big bitterness and you let a little a little uh offense become a great big my brother you let a little fear become a great big fear because you gave it a place but you don't have to give a place to the devil tonight you can kick them out and say this is the Temple of the Lord what agreement have the Temple of the Lord with Idols there is no agreement someone's going to give place to the word give place to the word that it might be made flesh in your life and yield yourself as instruments of righteousness what you what are you going to yield yourself toen because Satan is almost helpless without somebody to get into oh but so is the Lord depending on us so is the Lord depending on Humanity that he could get into and work through oh but what are you going to yield yourself to if if Hitler could yield himself to what he did and and look at what what what was Satan was able to accomplish through his life and and you look at Judas and and and Elvis Presley and what they yielded themselves to and what the Lord what Satan was able to accomplish through their lives but what about the positive what about somebody like Luther that could yield himself and and bring forth a message of justification and Wesley could bring forth sanctification and and brother brandom could yield himself and bring forth this great end time message and you take uh ones like your pastor that could yields and God could use them uh to begin to establish a church that would stand for the truth and you might yield yourself and BR brother don't worry so much about what you're going to do when you yield yourself just focus on yielding yourself and when you yield yourself one might go to preaching one might go to shouting one might go to seeing visions one might go to dancing don't worry about what you're going to do when your just yield yourself as an instrument of rightous and let the Lord take care of what's going to happen and God will place you where you're meant to be as a son or daughter of God you just let go stop trying to war with it Lord Lord what is my position you're anxious you're worried about what you're supposed to do but brother yield yourself to the Lord and let him use you for what he's called you to oh you don't have to worry about the details oh stop letting that anxious mind control your life and yield yourself to the spirit of the Lord and say Lord here I am be it unto me according to your word oh and let me be an instrument of righteousness oh God will take care of it God will take care of your future God will take care of your position He he'll lead you to an instrument he'll lead you to the front row he'll lead you to the sound booth I don't know where he's going to lead you but just let him lead let the God come into your life and Lead You In all rightous let him lead you through this message let him lead you at your school let him lead you in your home oh let the spirit of Truth lead you into all truth oh he's a guide oh he's not going to just beat you up and and pull you through on a chain he's going to lead you oh and know my voice oh they're led by the spirit hallelujah oh you say well I just come with an open mind but that's the problem sometimes brother Brandon say with these churches and their open mind has allowed them to receive all kinds of Creeds and dogmas so you don't necessarily want to come with a a blank mind as it were but come in your right mind because the mind is the womb to the spirit and there's a physical womb and a spiritual womb and but it starts in the mind the mind is the womb of the spirit the mind is where the first act takes place and we see that in the natural because the Bible said whosoever lookth upon a woman to lust after her showing that the First Act takes place in the mind uh but that also applies to the spiritual and that's how you can let in either a creat or a Dogma by refusing the word for a lie in your mind but brother though it has a negative there's also a positive and that's the same channel that you're born again by the Holy Ghost is that you take that word in your mind and you begin to receive it and it drops in your spirit and life comes down that channel and brings that word in the manifestation oh every every infallible word of God in the right ground will manifest itself amen did not the Bible say in John 5 he that heareth my words and believeth on him that sent me ha eternal life and shall not come into the Judgment but has passed from Death on the life you hear the word and you believe it oh and it finds a place to rest and brother brandom I never noticed this till the other day go ahead brother but he talks about maybe it's not not not necessarily in concrete but he said you know by commentaries we know that the blind prophetess an was Mary's mother and I don't know if that's true or not but brother Brandon mentions it and the spoken word is the Original Seed and so isn't that something that there was a blind woman oh but she couldn't see with her natural eyes but she said she would take that Isaiah 96 and she would begin to seow that seed over Mary's life a virgin shall conceive and bring forth a son oh and that word be to be sewed in that mind of Mary and as that prophecy circled the Earth there was good ground for it to fall into that she could say be it unto me that word had been circulating in her mind but one day dropped from her head to her heart and brought forth the manifested word oh it can't just be in your head he said a lie detector won't work on your mind it works on your soul and so if you say in your head that it's the truth but in the heart there's a demon doubting that word it's not going to work but if you could ever get that mind and that soul in harmony with the word it'll be banging on all cylinders it'll bring forth exactly what it said oh because there's a Harmony amen but that was Eve's problem that she stopped for a moment for that word of the enemy to come down in her in her her mind and then to lead her to stop and be deceived that first lie was ever told you shall not surely die but brother BR said it's like it's like something that's 95% right he said if you're talking about this service and we come in the church he said they was at the Tabernacle up here at the certain night the people all gathered in they sang hymns and the minister spoke and then you know what they passed the bottle around and all of them got drunk he said wrong see he said just the spirit fell down they all got drunk it's just that much difference they did stagger they did fall they did cut up but there wasn't a bottle that did it it was the Holy Ghost confirming his word with signs following and so then he say see that's the way with unbeliever the unidentified person with God who'll say oh I believe Jesus Christ is the Son of God I believe God is the father of Jesus Christ I believe all these other things see but when it comes down to this other part that's for another day when I'm reading this for a reason he said there's the LIE of it that's right he's trying to twist a little of the right word around to make it deceiving to the people but then he said what Jesus made the thing clear amen he said these shines shall confirm the message that I have and I love that so much brother Jesus makes the thing clear he doesn't make it confusing he's not the author of confusion if the devil has sod his doctrines of of all kinds of ridiculous things that don't line up with the word at all and it's clear as mud but God sent this message to tie the loose ends together that you wouldn't have to walk in confusion no more but you could walk in Clarity you could walk in Clarity of the scripture where those Muddy Waters were made clear and you could see clearly what he's talking about you could see clearly the godhead You Could See Clearly the serpent seed You Could See Clearly who you were amen oh that's the LIE of the devil that's right oh but God makes things clearl amen oh God makes things clear but here the devil said yes sir the lie that Satan told Eve he didn't mean what he said he didn't mean it see how he whitewashed the word now God said it but he didn't meet it he said that same rotten lie is told by Satan to preachers and church members today the word of God says so and so but it doesn't mean that but the Bible said a little leav Lev's the whole lump and brother said it's got to be perfectly right or it isn't right at all and if one part can be right then brother it'll lead to an instable home it'll lead to an instable family because you'll be like have we trusted the wrong thing if one thing could be wrong couldn't all be wrong but no brother that's that old Palmer worm that's come in he's trying to eat the faith in the word he's trying to eat at your faith and say oh uh this Bible's been it's been interpreted so many times how could it be true that's that old Palmer worm devil that's come in to eat your faith but this word came from God in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and it says the prophecy came not in all time by the will of man but holy men of God spake as they were removed by the Holy Ghost it's a devil trying to lead you to an instability that maybe it's not right maybe it won't hold me in the time of trouble but it's a lie it's nothing but the truth it's nothing but the word yes my brother oh see Satan's tact tactic is to destroy the influence of something brother said if the devil could ever get the deity out of the name of Jesus he have the church whipped oh he's not coming to take the name of Jesus he's only come for the deity and he also said if Satan can just destroy the influence of the message he's got it whipped he's not come maybe to just take the whole message he's just come to destroy its influence so that you can't trust it with everything you can't trust it for your family you can't trust it for your loved ones you can't trust it in the hour of trouble oh but it's a lie of the devil amen amen amen it's nothing but a lie brother brandom said what if I said that I would come into this meeting and there would be a crippled woman and we lay our hands on her and she'd recover what if I said that there would be a Waterhead baby and as soon as we prayed the baby's head was going normal what if I said that four men in dark suits would be bearing a dead man and as soon as prayers offered his Spirit returns and then there comes your 5-year-old brother killed on the street you bring him to me I'll be standing by a doorstep and there's a man with a light suit on I'll be speaking to him and your little brother's going to be whole now he said what if that first woman comes and and she's not healed what if that water head baby comes and she's not healed then when it comes to your little brother brother the influence is lost you're you're scared to death that he's not going to be healed he said but what if it is there what if the woman is healed what if the Waterhead baby is healed and brother Brandon begins to lay these things in then when you comes to your brother you're not worried at all you just say praise God we're fixing to see a miracle anden and brother said now we're at the time of the Rapture it's going to happen because it's been perfect every other time and it's got to be perfect this time God is calling out a people oh and in having conferences he said I tell the truth in Christ I lie not there's no man can take the doctrine that I preach and disprove it there's no one can do it I've never seen anyone could do it it's the gospel truth the discernments of the spirit is perfect no man can ever say it's not been perfect and I'll tell you now there's a perfect place a perfect heaven a perfect God a perfect savior a perfect blood a perfect atonement a perfect being for you and we say we're resting on that amen there's enough influence in this message that it'll hold you and if it was enough to save you if it was enough to deliver you if it was enough to fill you with the Holy Ghost isn't there enough influence there that power of influence resonating that says it's enough to change my body am can you trust it enough to give your life to it are you willing to give your life for this message yes my brother oh yes my brother and maybe not just naturally but are you willing to Die daily for this message are you willing to give your opinions for this message are you willing to give every thought that's contrary to this word that you could be that pure bride that spoken word seed bride that would manifest Jesus Christ on this Earth again that says Be unto me oh Mary did what Eve didn't do she received that word into her heart and there was an agreement there was a Harmony and brother there's power in harmony there's power in agreeing with this word brother Mary could say be it on to me and that life would take hold oh what about hady right oh when brother Brandon's telling about that that Jehovah Gyra that could speak squirrels and she said it's nothing but the truth I believe that just came from her mind I believe that came from her heart and then that power of Harmony that come forth of voice howy ask what you will and it'll be done unto you right and then brother Brandon want to talk about how that right family would get up and give testimony in the church he said the blessings has never left that home brother if you want to see blessings visit your home start walking in harmony with this word start putting this word above everything else and watch the blessings visit your home oh you begin to agree with this word until you can ask what you will yes oh it's until this word says by a Stripes I am healed your mind grasp it and said by a Stripes I am healed the soul grasp it and says by a Stripes I am healed brother you're going somewhere then that word has found a place to take hold oh give place to the word of the hour give place to the promises of God oh May a Spirit of Harmony sweep through this building and begin to tie this word to your mind to your soul and begin to lift you out of your current condition you don't have to be a slave to that lie anymore oh you served that devil long enough he which the son has made free is free indeed oh you don't have to bow down to that Idol but like Daniel oh determine in your heart I'm going to stay with the word I will not bow to the enemy amen amen amen am amen prach my oh there's a word yes sir this word every link forms a chain right and it's holding you over hell brother say and it's only as strong as it's weakest link oh that's why you can't add to it that's why you can't take it away that's why it does make a difference whether it's the word or not that's right oh Satan told Eve it doesn't make a difference oh but but it does make a difference it does make a difference oh would you jump off a cliff if your friend did I hope not and would you disagree with this word because your neighbor out in the world didn't know you're a different people you're a separated people you're not the church you're the bride you're a separated onto the word of the Lord You're called onto this holy Union with the word how can two walk together except they be agreed but you're not called to walk with your neighbor down the street you're not called to walk with the devil you're called to walk with this word and the bride can walk with the word because she is the word and the word connects with word life connects with life and it brings you back into a fellowship oh that it looks impossible sometimes brother Steven how could we keep every word how could we possibly hold that chain together with our own ability but God made a way to breed back a bride to breed back a people through a perfect blood oh he said I'll put en enity between my seed thy seed and her seed but Eve didn't have a seed she was a woman but it was speaking of a savior it was speaking of Christ the seed that would come forth and shed his perfect blood to breed back a people that could be filled with his spirit that they would have the truth again dwelling in human vessels oh you in your own ability couldn't do it but God has bred back of people with a non-adulterated faith in the word that they wouldn't add to the word or take from word oh but he sent back his Spirit there's a spoken word seed Bride on the earth oh that is bone of his bone flesh of his flesh oh being of his being oh she is him she is him Jesus Christ manifested in flesh again on the earth brother we're not looking for it it's here it's come in its infancy but it's growing forth in the full manifestation till one day the ministry of Jesus Christ will be so like it was when he was here on Earth that it will call forth those loved ones from the grave to a resurrection that's right oh it's a uniting time it's uniting with the word the fellowship that Eve left off oh he's bred you back to the Holy Spirit hallelujah oh it seems impossible except a man be born again yes sir oh and God could place the spirit of Truth in an individual that the only way for truth to come come back Hallelujah would be through that you could speak the truth but how could you speak it oh except God would plant something in your life amen when Ahab went up to fight at Routh Gilead and Jehoshaphat said we should consult the Lord about this and they consulted 400 preachers and they got an answer but it wasn't good enough for Jehoshaphat said do you have one more said yes I got a Micaiah I've got a Micaiah but I hate him he's always prophesying evil against me but he said go get him and let's see what he says and he said oh you can just say what the rest of them were saying but he said no I'll say what the I'll say what the word of the Lord says I'll only say what the L what the word says and brother Brandon said you can be a Micaiah said I'll only say what this word says and so he begins to prophesy what looks like evil over Ahab but prophecy had to be fulfilled brother and God said brother BR said that God was up there counseling that what we do that Ahab would be deceived and prophecy might be fulfilled and the lying Spirit came up from hell and said I'll go down and get into those 400 preachers that he'll be deceived oh but why couldn't that lying Spirit get into Micaiah because he was of a different breed he was of the spirit of Truth and brother God got to you before that lying Spirit ever could and impregnated you with the SE word of God and God got to you before the devil could and that's why you cannot commit adultery with this word you're already pregnated your womb is already sealed and all you can say brother this word is for me I don't care what the devil says this word is for me this word is for my family oh you want to know what this message means to me brother if Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and he is then this word means to me that I can too it means if it works for brother brandom it'll work for me if it worked for brother Steven it'll work for me if it worked for Paul it'll work for me if Jesus could do it then I can too because he's the same yesterday today and forever and I'm a Believer and that channel is open for the word to come in so brother if he raised from the dead we can too if he healed the sick we can too if he's spoken tongues we can too if blind Bemus can trust to him so can you if the woman with the blood is you can trust in so can you GL oh it's a Revival of Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever amen amen as we bring it to a close brother brandham talked about that bumblebee he said science learned that the Bumblebee was too heavy to fly oh he just couldn't fly but he said so the Bumblebee didn't know what science was saying about him so he just flew anyhow and brother Brandon said they say that Miracles can't happen but we just had to do like the Bumblebee didn't we Brother Hicks Fly Away anyhow and do the work of the Lord oh brother Congressman Upshaw shouldn't have ever walked again after being crippled for 66 years but he did it anyhow yes sir Georgie Carter should have never got out of bed after being there for 9 years and weighing 35 lbs but she did it anyhow oh there's a young girl by the name of Mariah pu at alipa oh she shouldn't have natural beautiful hair today but she does anyhow brother oh brother Ron Spencer with four stage cancer shouldn't still be alive according to Medical Science but he's alive anyhow why because you've stopped listening to the voice of science you stop listening to the voice of the devil oh and why don't you do like the Bumblebee tonight and just fly away despite what the devil says despite what that lie says over your mind Fly Away oh you shouldn't be here but you are anyhow brother you never should have got the Holy Ghost but you did anyhow you broke through family Cycles you broke through family bondage you broke through all kinds of opposition opposition means nothing when God speaks and brother the word has spoken over our lives and we're here anyhow we're going to make it anyhow we're going to make a Rapture anyhow oh because God said I'll have a bride without without spot or wrinkle and I say be it unto me according to your word oh Lord oh do you feel the power of influence it'll work this message Works it'll work for your family oh cast down imagination oh but if God's given you a good mind then don't waste it just let him wash it and use that mind to say oh Lord hallelujah it's reasonable that if you're the same yesterday today and forever then you're still a heal oh God's given you a good memory why don't you use it to remember the promises of God God's given you a good mind to think why don't you start thinking about the Lord and His blessings Lord if you're a Healer yesterday then it's reasonable that you're still a Healer today my brother it's reasonable that you're still filling with the Holy Ghost brother it's reasonable that if that infallible word can never fall on good ground it'll manifest exactly what he said yes my brother oh if you want to reason devil then let's reason Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever oh and so it's reasonable that if a people could just believe all things are possible it's reasonable that if Jesus Christ is in this building right now there's no limit to what take place it's reasonable that if he's here then if it may be 4 days late in your mind it may be just on time in his mind because that's what he did for Martha and that's what he can do for you oh just let that reason come through the word don't let it come through the devil let it come through this word and say Lord I believe it you're the amen amen You're The Great I Am amen amen it's nothing but the truth amen glory to God oh let it grow yes sir brother Brenham said all things that's not all things that's against that word are contrary to it will have to move yes my brother it to give place yes sir because the word is coming triumphantly there's nothing can stop it amen God has done said so amen amen amen now the devil yes sir presumed that he could follow that Israelite Army through the Red Sea that's the problem but see the devil was not of the same caliber that's exactly right it was a bunch of uncircumcised Philistines that presumed we can too but it didn't work for them because that wasn't their law in the scripture amen but if you can know where you stand in that word then you can stand fast oh and that devil can't go where you're going he can't follow you into that Holy Ghost he can't follow you into that third pole he can't follow you into this Rapture am that's not his part of scripture but this Jubilee has called your name and because you were a Son of God born into this kingdom of God God Gave You ears to hear that trumpet say come out of her come back to your Homeland come back to your inheritance oh it was a certain sound brother Steven it was a it was a solid sound that's exactly right because my brother brother Brandon would say about about how America's Revival was over right and he said that after he preached that a young man got up and said well he was a Pentecostal I have the quote but just paraphrasing it said it may be over for brother Brandon but it's not over for me and you know got all excited and that that's nice it sounds nice it sounds like Jubilee but it was an uncertain sound that's exactly because it wasn't from the word amen amen amen amen and brother we've heard a jubilee trumpet and it's a certain sound calling us out of confusion calling you to a liberty calling you to your position as a son and yes my brother and and now it's not priest blowing the trumpets but it's it's ministers blowing the gospel trumpet and how can we Blow The Gospel trumpet and know it's going to be a certain sound just stay with the message stay with only the word of God and brother you sound that word it'll be a certain sound that's it oh and sometimes it'll bring correction right sometimes it'll bring encouragement that's right but brother br said you'll either be a truth rejecting prisoner or know the truth and go free and when I say Lord I want to receive this truth amen and I Want to Be Free amen and me if this word blesses me I want to receive its blessing if it corrects me I want to receive its correction but I just want to blow that trumpet oh just as The Messengers have blown it Through the Ages all right in this word amen oh and we want to rejoice yes sir if I need corrected then Lord correct me that's it but if I'm if I'm blessed then bless you see sometimes as the musicians can come sometimes it's so much easier for you to give place to the negative anden and you'll take correction all day long and feel like you deserve it but when the word once says you're blessed it's so hard for you to receive that but guys you think maybe it's not for me but I made so many mistakes but brother you got stop giving place to the devil and start giving place to the word and if the word corrects you give place to it but if the word blesses you place to it give place to the blessings give place to the healing give place to the Holy Ghost give place to the blood to forgive you of your sins and let it go put it behind you oh let the word wash your minds and renew you in your mind amen amen amen amen amen it's nothing but the truth glory to God oh it's nothing but the truth yes my brother yes oh we want to wonderful we want the truth Lord yes sir yes my brother stand to your feet hallelujah amen glory to God hallelujah maybe every eye closed Hallelujah brother BR said I see R in sitting behind her there there a lady sitting there that keeps holding the side of her breast she's got a hurting and burning in her breast isn't that right lady he said that's trying to be a demon coming there he didn't say it was a demon he said that's trying to be a demon coming there but you accept your healing now raise up your hand say I accept my healing that's right God bless you then go go home and be well amen and then and then in the message I am the resurrection and the life he said I believe he's here right now I believe that this feeling that's moving through the church right now like a Milky Way coming over the building I believe that's the same holy ghost that fell on the day of Pentecost believest thou this I believe down in your heart it's a moving just about to make you explode right there I believe that's the Holy Ghost trying to get in this afternoon believest thou this I believe he heal heal every person here right now believest thou
