will take care of it brother chad lamb will be preaching for brother scott smith tonight if anybody is interested you just see the deacon they already have the address and you can be there amen but let's deal with what we have to do here first amen blessed be the name of the lord let's go to our scripture i thought the young sister will be so excited you see what happened you pray and when the prayer comes the answer comes you're afraid you're sitting in the house peter lord please save peter please save peter please save peter and peter come at the door and begin to knock and they come they look at peter and they run away you know that story right and they begin to tell them it's peter they say no peter is already dead this is his ghost so what are you praying for if peter is already dead is your peter dead oh praise god thank you lord sam let's go to joshua chapter 2. anyway paul said that if you stay single he spared you so that's good if you want to remain that way no problem very good and cling unto the things of the lord amen if you're there you can say amen we appreciate all the family members that are here this morning we do not have visitors we got family members so our family members god richly bless you amen joshua chapter 2 verse 9. you know the story right very familiar it's a rahab and she said to the man to the spies the spies came into jericho and for some reason this young woman have taken a risk she took the spies and hide them and the king already knew and they even sent soldier to her home so she taken a risk why is she taking this risk why amen and she said to the man i know that the lord has given you this land the land how does she know how how does she know jump to verse 14 and then we're going to come back and the man answer here our life for yours if you either not this our business and it shall be when the lord has given us the land despise the lord it shall be it's like something in the future but for rahab she knows that it's a done deal she knows that husband is already there you might be seated i'm gonna drive that in you [Music] you want to stay single and go under depression and i have to stay all night praying no you're going to get married [Applause] [Laughter] that's exactly what it is amen gonna stay there i'm okay i'm okay at the night you crying and when the husband come oh i was saying lord i don't want to go in heaven like this oh my god let's go to verse 9. oh my and she said to the man i know that the lord has given you the land how do you know who told you so somebody have faith don't worry you're going to say amen down the road so rahab had faith she had the substance that the deal was already done amen come on and that your terror is falling upon us and that all the inhabitants of the land fent because of you in other way these are yeah you don't know who you are we are already down here amen and israel probably is preparing for the battle lord jesus when i go to the battle of jericho i don't want to die amen verse 10 for we so not only rehab but the entire city of jericho we have heard how the lord dried up the water of the red sea so the news was not only given to rehab alone everybody heard the news but how did they respond to the news they heard is what determines what kind the seed is laying in you you can all hear the message in this church you can all hear about the covenants and the armenian and everything but the way you react to the sermon amen is only telling me the seed that you have inside somebody can hear the message intellectually and despite how many times we can preach about something they still don't want to change anybody here but the same in the same church someone else is there when they hear the message that message is doing something unto them anybody care she said we everybody i'm not the only one everybody here right anybody care for we have heard how the lord dried up the water of the red sea for you in other words we heard how you cross the red sea and the red sea i will get to this down the road the red sea brother branham speaks and explained that it was water baptism because israel was baptized in the red scene paul said that do you know that paul said that somebody is looking at me like this keep your finger right there let's go to first corinthians chapter 10. i don't want you to say brother steven say if you begin to read the bible daily in a in a diligent way your life will be easy because my way i have to grant you in the scripture and in the message of the hour so if you listen to the message and you read your bible you're making yourself an easy work are you there let's go to verse 10. chapter 10 verse 1. i was not intended probably to read this but we would deal with this down the road moreover brethren i would not that you should be ignorant because if i don't show you this somebody will get stuck into that and forget the whole sermon yeah and the devil will keep you there wait wait wait wait where and you think you and and you're missing everything else how that all our father were under the cloud everybody seen that and all passed through the water everybody seen that and we're all water to what moses in the cloud and in the water let's go back now to our joshua any question anymore so what a baptism the red sea speaks of what this is coming from rahab amen we have heard how that the lord joined up the water the water the water baptism of the red sea for you come on when you came out of egypt she also speaking about the coming out the coming out of the exodus and this coming out was under the sacrificial number everybody okay which was the brazen altar now you can read the bible differently now i was telling somebody this morning i say when we preach the way we preach you should not start with your old thinking hey mark here the material you're getting is the tool that now you can begin to use for your entire life you can read your life and work differently you can read people at walmart differently but just with the tool that you have you are utilizing mathematics every day but you don't know how did you know that you need to do this before this car pass i need to stop and describe and do this how do you do that there is math going on quickly but you don't know you're using math because you learn math now you know how to use it and it becomes a life hallelujah when you came out of egypt everybody and what you did to the two kings of the amorite that were on the other side of water this is before they cross jordan hey mark here this is before they cross jordan jordan is somewhere here which is death remember elisha and elijah have to cross jordan and enter to the promised land to receive the spirit before they cross jordan there is a killing that happened am i reading a different bible there is a killing of certain kings they have to wipe certain kings you have not get them yet they have to sanctify now somebody gathered other courts everybody holy place anybody here what remain for rahab am i reading a different bible what was rare but asking the spy give me water why did she jump on the hole he goes quick the language of the tabernacle at the opening of the seventh seal the bible become anew that's why you miss a sermon you put yourself in trouble anybody here that were on the other side of jordan sahon and og whom you orderly deal with water destroyed do you know that jericho they have to cross jordan do you know that so the token was here other court holy place you cross jordan like elijah then what happened wonderful brother michael amen verse 11. and as soon as we have heard these things many people heard it our heart everybody did melt neither did there remain any more courage in any man because of you so rahab is talking to the two spies remember paul and silas have to go into the prison to get the philippian jailer out of prison with redemption and joshua also is sending two spies to minister everybody okay now and the two minister got into jericho because somebody need to be rescued there but when they came and made contact with rehab rehab begin to give them the place that she is in the tabernacle everybody here so when herrera picked them up the work of rehab was the expression of her faith everybody okay i can't rush with this thing the work of rahab the deed of him they did or the work or the actions of rahab was an expression of her faith anybody care that's why brother branham preacher message works his water works equal faith express everybody here in other words the definition of work is the expression of faith the life that you leave the deed that you do the work that you do the action that you do in your life or on social media is only an expression of your faith what you put up on social media is showing us the letter of your faith what you're putting up on facebook on instagram on whatsapp it's showing us where you are in your faith you don't do it by any chance there is a spirit driving you to put up something on whatsapp you cannot believe that a woman should not wear paint but on your whatsapp you are posting women wearing paints you bringing a confusion a mixed message i'm now going to pull back everybody okay all right verse 11. and as soon as we have heard these things our heart did melt neither did there remain any more courage in any man because of you everybody ready for the lord your god you remember that language it reminds you of who oh my god i love this church it reminds you of who the lord your god anybody care he is god i thought this was a hidden woman who who taught her about god who preached to her about this god she only heard and faith cometh by water hearing water she heard the testimony coming up and she believed the testimony and she made up her decision already that this god is the true god so she was now expressing her faith confessing her faith hallelujah for the lord your god he is god in water heaven above and in the earth beneath what a confession anybody care now that i have explained you where i am i have not talked to you about me having the token i told you i already passed the other court i told you i'm already in the holy place there is one thing missing now this is my request i'm at the altar i met the altar of essence now did i lose anybody if you lost you don't listen to the sermon everybody okay now therefore i pray you in the altar of essence in the altar of essence this just dropped from heaven now i pray you at the altar of answers anybody here now i pray you swear to me what do you want to know swear to me by who who taught her you can swear by that god the god that she doesn't know swear to me by the lord since i have showed you water this kindness was against her own nation she betrayed her nation she reminds her nation she rejected her country of birth she rejected her her nationality she want to be under a different nationality that's why i'm calling your god i'm even swearing under your god because i don't belong to this nation anymore in other words i cannot stay here i don't belong here my flesh belongs here but me rehab on my inside i am a jew i am an israelite i cannot stay here oh my god blessed be the name of the lord wow since i show you your candy i'll show you kindness that you will also show me whatever connects to who what did the philippians say how can i be and paul say believe on the lord jesus christ and you shall be saved you and water am i reading a different bible so rahab bring the token not for herself let me shift differently rahab is asking the token for her and her father house because the promise is unto you everybody okay and unto your children and as many as the lord your god shall water 238 right here she's on act 2 38. this is how you read the bible everybody okay how many minutes did we take how do you read the bible five minutes you finish this is how you eat your bible you go slowly and you jump you say at the beginning and you stop you say what is the beginning then that stranger comes and begins to talk to you he say the beginning go to john 1. in the beginning was the oh then one chapter will take you 10 hours everybody okay he said show kindness to my father's house and give me a true water i'm already having the two completed i'm missing the token anybody care remember that's that's job she heard everybody here she spoke about the lamb and the word of baptism she already completed the other court she already completed the holy place but she's still living in jericho she has not come out of jericho yet the snake is still there is he connecting the only thing that can take her out of jericho is the token everybody okay now everybody okay when the token comes then jericho completely is finished and when she leave forever her past is gone her friends are gone every bad things that she did in jericho is completely wiped out [Music] to do that now you need the token you see why you need to get to the holiest oh my god everybody you need to be merciful on me on time because you're the one pulling okay okay and that you will save a life i don't want dead corpse i want them alive who are you to give such species such to be specific who are you to tell us how to save somebody amen in other words i don't want no dead body i am not going to carry a coffin not in my house everybody in my house will stay alive [Music] they never left the coffin of joseph they picked up the coffin of joseph and they begin to live with it so it's a dead and they're living together under exodus those that were dead and they're living together living in the rapture those that were dead will rise again and with the living there we are going together because that coffin was under a promise everybody here that you will save and love my father karma and my mother this is a child praying for the salvation of her parent everybody here camber and mine brethren kama and mai kama and all that they do what not only them but their property also can i help you even that chair that they came and took away from me [Music] i hope you're getting that do you know where i'm coming from do you know they took a chair from brother branama but in the sixth dimension he saw the chair over there even his dog in the sixth dimension all that they have this message is christ this message is perfectly in line with the bible hallelujah oh my god and deliver our life from water death i don't want to die and the man answered her everybody here our life for yours what enough if you order not this our business and it shall be when the lord has given us the land that we will dear kindly and truly with you everybody here jump to verse 17. and the man said to her we will be blameless of this you're off she's the one that proposed the oath hey marquis which you have made us swear what pressure did rahab have that this man have to swear anybody care behold when we come into the land you shall burn this line of water though your sin be red asda you remember the tabernacle the scarlet color because red through red is what their house of rahab was already read by sin it was a house of prostitution so they have to put red outside so when joshua is coming when he's looking at the red skullet through the red everybody in that house is white when their death angel is coming on jericho when he's zooming in he looks he see red and red he said not don't touch this house destroy these other houses oh my god in the window which you did let us down by and you shall bring your father come on and your and yo and all your father has hold home to you everybody okay and it shall be that whosoever shall go out of the door of yours i thought he was a house of prostitution ever here out of your house into the street everybody clear his blood shall be upon his head and we will be guiltless of whosoever shall be with you in the house his blood shall be on our head if any hand be upon him eternally justification sanctification baptism of the holy spirit all three in rahab let's go to hebrew 11. we already preached the message the whole sermon is already preached amen hallelujah exodus chapter uh hebrew chapter 11 verse 31 i told you that rahab has faith right so if you were doubting in your heart i'm going to help you up okay if you have a question anybody care remember no sleeping your time of grace is gone the deacon pulled the sword anybody care sorry if you feel like you're going to do it you sit on the back so they can punch you quickly on the back and nobody will see that's the correct way to do it but if you sit on the front that's your problem don't say they embarrass me you sit on the back anybody here hebrew chapter 11. that's your pastor verse 31 you there buy water by faith the who the whole lord will have perished not by water faith so rehab again edible head water any question by faith rahab the harlot perish not with them that believe not so those people heard everybody here but they did not believe so the only one that believed was rehab so rahab had faith is he clear now that belief not so if somebody did not believe someone else did believe and the one who believed was rahab kama when she received the spies with water where did that peace came from when we are justified then we make everybody okay so rahab was justified brother stephen this is a deduction is it a deduction let's go to james chapter 2. anybody care james chapter 2 verse 22. if you're there you can say amen remember last time see you have faith paul says she's justified by what faith see you have faith wrote or working with his work james's phd in work and by work was faith made water remember last sunday and the scripture was fulfilled which say abraham believed god you know the calvinist and he was imputed to him for righteousness and he was called the friend of god anybody here you see then how that by works a man is water justified and not by faith only they both said missed anybody care likewise also was not who am i reading a different bible rail have the water the whole lot do what everybody okay so rahab was water yes she was justified that's why she could speak about the water that's why she could speak about the sacrificial lamb and her work was showing that she's already in the holy place because now she's acting against her own will against her own country against her own nature anybody care she's doing things that normally she should not have done but something is driving her anybody care rehab the whole lot justified by works we okay now she was already justified when she had received the messenger i thought they were spies now they were you see now i thought they were spies you called them spies in the old testament but they were they were angels you thought they are sending spies no they were sending it was joshua the holy ghost that i was sending everybody here messenger and then send them out another another way everybody care for us the body without the spirit is dead so faith without work is water let's go to ruth chapter 2 and then we pray alleluia blessed be the name of the lord you go to roof chapter 2 and you pulse there rehab had faith according to hebrew she was justified according to james but despite her other court and the holy place she was still in jericho it took the token ever here to take her completely out of jericho and wipe all her past so the token took her up and burned jericho destroy and burn the snake completely removed the snake her deed was nothing but the expression of her faith because works is fresh his faith expressed everything now let's pray heavenly father lord we are approaching you humbly again father this morning thanking you for your grace for your love your mercy father and for everything you have been doing for us lord we have done what any man that you given the ability to do can do father but when it comes to feeding your children interpreting and ministering and giving a revelation you only take a supernatural action of the holy spirit lord may you move me completely out of the way may you come and speak to your children and bless them be the alpha and the omega of this service we seal the devil completely out and paralyze every demonic forces of the work of darkness father completely away from this place in the name of jesus christ amen last sunday we stopped at the marriage in the other court you remember that and brother branham say as long because the father of the young men say that he was he repented he was baptized but he behaved you the bad behavior from the family was still there why because the snake is still there remember when you baptize when you are repented on the justification the snake the bad habit is still there anybody clear so that's why brother branham said as long as that boy did not receive the holy ghost do not let him marry because he's going to be hell to somebody else some of you did not know this kind of stuff and some jump into marriage that's why you struggle a lot but now where you are stand up stop what you are doing and move forward into the holidays so your marriage can begin to bring good fruit anybody clear so there was a quote that i forgot but before i go to that quote i'm going to read this in exodus chapter 25 31 the bible speaks about the candlestick and the bible says that the candlestick was made out of pure gold let me go here the candlestick why are you talking about the candlestick they were made out of pure gold we know god speak of water thank you jesus amen and of beating work anybody care a bitten work so making the candlestick was not easy it was a painful painful suffering everybody care to make the candlestick they have to beat something right here candlestick our light it's a light that is made out of seven single lights anybody care and this light speaks of something very painful anybody okay blessed be the name of the lord that shall make a candlestick of pure gold of beaten work beaten work everybody here shall they can the stick be made his shaft and his branches and his ball and his knobs and his flower shall be of the water everything is built into that candlestick when you look you're gonna see flower it looks beautiful you will see branches and shaft and everything and it's made out of pure gold but it was beaten work that made it everybody okay so the quote i wanted to give you last sunday was that brother branham same question and answer what had happened to that woman he said the same thing would have she had kept messing around without receiving the holy ghost playing in church 20 years in the message 15 years in the message born in a message sending a message all this kind of stuff just like that woman over yonder today that called me and wanted to marry the man and leave her own husband and marry the man she had come in such a place maybe one time being in contact with god but had been lasting after the things of the world never progresses and i ask her and say have you received the holy ghost she said not yet but i am water i am seeking it i said you get the holy ghost first and he the holy ghost will tell you what husband to have anybody here the choices that you make in life and back here is only a diagnosis of what you have on your inside because a man filled with the holy spirit or a woman filled with the holy spirit make choices differently and certain choices that you make when you buy your chosen when you buy your dresses when you buy your stuff are only expressing the level of your spiritual life anybody care so this morning we are talking about the four faces of roof you there on the camera yes sir the four faces of roof roof serving we talk about roof grace roof tabernacle roof justification roof under looter roof at the water baptist roof air the brazen altar now you understand all of that now we're on roof serving when we spoke about the tabernacle brother branham says this is just a reminder that in the old testament being a top of the new the works of the inward courts three courts of the tabernacle was a beautiful picture of god's plan of salvation for his man kind then when we started we found out that ruth has four faces brother branham say that from four different phases of roof i gather wrote here roof deciding making her decision we went through that roof serving roof resting roof rewarded roof making the decision roof after she made her decision in other words she completed the first step she plateau on the first step then roof is now serving then roof when she plateau on serving roof then is resting and when she plateau on resting then roof is what rewarded everybody here so far now when we go back in our tabernacle if you come and you look at this you'll be completely lost that's why you need to keep up with the sermon ever here now we found out that when roof came she entered by the gate you know what that gates mean and then through the gate she went through the present altar everybody remember and from the brazen altar she move on to the water baptism into the level everybody okay so far then we put roof under justification everybody okay you okay put your seatbelt i'm just maneuvering in the airport everybody roof deciding or roof under justification and brother branham says that and the justification was under luther everybody okay sanctification was wesley and the baptism of the holy spirit we know our messenger everybody here and last sunday we found out that luther have a big baby called calvin everybody okay and wesley has a big baby called armenians everybody here so far everybody okay so far so when we started we went to roof deciding by repenting and water baptism or roof under justification or roof on the looter or roof under cavern hey buddy okay now we are in roof serving in other words roof under sanctification or roof under wesley or roof under armenian everybody okay so far brother branham says this that we talk of that kingsman redemon which we found out was crust top it up with here with roof roof deciding roof serving roof resting deciding was justification you already know that serving kama making herself water so roof surfing according to brother branham means roof is making herself ready because what branham said that it's like a glass that was dropped in numerically he said when you pick up the glasses justification but the glass is dirty about here but when you clean the glass it's sanctification and sanctification means to clean every care and set aside for what sanctification means to clean and set aside for service every care for service that's why sanctification is making herself ready in other words roof preparing herself everybody here something dropped here roof decided everybody okay but roof have to serve you can decide on the husband everybody okay but you gotta learn how to serve or you gotta prepare yourself or make yourself ready for that marriage everybody okay you gotta know how to watch this season you gotta know how to clean up a house you gotta know how to take care of your little brother and sister everybody okay you gotta know how to fix your bedroom you gotta know how to spend your money you gotta know how to buy groceries you gotta know how to pay bills you gotta prepare yourself make yourself ready for the oncoming harassment everybody okay don't trust in credit card they can block it for you if it's no outside amazon can deliver when it snows everybody so making herself ready sanctification resting was with the holy spirit until the wedding supper come how beautiful the church come through john wesley martin luther justification john wesley sanctification pentecostal baptism of the holy spirit now resting everybody waiting for the coming of god a roof rewarded everybody cares so far blessed be the name of the lord brother branham if you notice here the step of justification if you did it correctly you remember sincerely this step automatically will move you into sanctification anybody care anybody because justification make way for sanctification in other words when justification is plateau when you finish your step of justification automatically it will open the door for sanctification because between before you enter the other court you have the gate everybody okay that gate is who you already know that and before you enter the holy place you have water the door and that door is who and before you enter the holy place you have the veil and that fail is who anybody here so if they crashed that open the gate do you follow me the holy spirit that opened your gate unto justification is the same christ that will automatically open the gate unto sanctification and it's the same christ that will open the gate also unto the baptism of the holy spirit you just have to make sure what you did that the gate is correct everybody okay so far brother paul saying hebrew 10 that heaven therefore brethren boldness to enter into the water holiest the third one by the blood of jesus christ by a new and living way which he has consecrated for us through the water that is to say to his water so when they were preaching jesus christ do you know what came out of it water and water and water which was talking about somebody giving birth the birth by a man a man giving birth the birth of a man is always on the side the breath of adam happened by the river you burn off a woman you're in trouble but when you burn off a man it's a different story everybody okay so far so there when you get to the ver which is the flesh this is where the birth conversion conversion the new birth happen pentecostal confuse this they say you give your heart to jesus christ you got the holy ghost no have you received the holy ghost since you believe here so the gate is crushed the door is crushed the veil is crushed the same christ automatically we bring you into something amen amen but if you've been in the message so long without the holy ghost you need to check your experience maybe you are in the message what you are because you were born in the message and you think by being born in a message and dressing like message people and acting like the people in the message you have the holy ghost you don't have the holy ghost even if you are born in a message and you never wear a paint and they never pierce your ear and everything look clean like the rich young ruler you must have a day that you settle you and jesus christ you must have a day that you give your heart because your birth in the message was a mess you were born in a message by sex the nature that you were born in a message is a wrong nature even though everything that you do is correct by religion you need to take your heart and give it to the lord once you do that automatically it will open the door to your sanctification nobody taught rahab what to do there were no preacher over there telling her now it's time for you to be moving when she saw the jews automatically she moved and by moving she was justified by her action everybody okay so far hallelujah so now we are entering roof surfing roof surfing means that roof now have moved from down here can i repeat it again roof is no longer under justification she's no longer in the deciding point she already passed the president she already passed the left she already passed luther she already passed calvin now roof is moving up into the roof serving into the holy place now the circle now is in a holy place be the name of the lord roof now serving in the holy place everybody so far brother branham says this in the holy place he says first she had to decide whether she was going to go into this land or not with naomi she had to make a water do you know when jericho was taken off and rahab and her family came out was rehab married before after rahab came out of jericho do you know that she got married and do you know she got married in which tribe why a man of judah love her if you need a scripture you let me know because the genealogy of jesus christ is talking about the land of judah that's why rahab is there rahab was the mother of boras anybody care why only a man of judah have to marry rehab the scepter is on judah everybody care it's judah that break the law and put you into the house and shut the door and nobody said nothing because remember the tribe of judah was right here remember the tribe of judah was right here so that's why rahab have to enter by judah and by entering on judah not any kind of family in judah but the very land of the lord jesus christ everybody here oh my god roof she had to decide she had to make a decision then after she got there she already made a decision now she's now in the promised land after she got there the next thing she had to do was to do what in the water the serving have to happen in a place can i raise this the serving have to happen number one serving means making herself ready serving is in a holy place and serving happen in the field of boars not any kind of field everybody okay because there is a specific order to order the crop everybody here you remember that not any water you got to be a specific message everybody here out there barefooted is that easy barefooted so if there is a torn there what happened to roof serving everybody okay and the justification it was hallelujah hey and naomi traveling brother kelly this is the day this everything joyful everything's fine everyday everybody how are you doing where do we go we're going to the land of judah it is so beautiful oh praise the lord i love you lord all of that going on and they were expecting when they get in the promised land everybody was clapping the hand [Music] anybody care do you know what happened to ruth when she entered the promised land do you know do you know what happened when she entered bear with me you're the one pulling let's go to roof one are you there are you there go to roof chapter 1 verse 19. i thought i'm going to move quickly but you somebody's pulling 35 miles school time school zone 25. anybody here verse 19 you're there so day too went until they came to water oh this is the city of naomi so as soon as we enter the family of naomi are coming now i mean she drop everything come on now it's been a long time praise god let's see what happened anybody care and he came to pass when they were come to bethlehem that all the city was water move about them for joy and they say is this water do you know why they were asking that question everybody here they were not saying is this now on me they were saying naomi is this you mama come and behind her a young lady because you're entering a different stage the happiness is going out things became a little bit bigger now everybody okay you understanding serving at the beginning hallelujah hallelujah joy joy after a while it looks like persecution beginning to come up anybody okay things became tight you thought your friend will be happy and suddenly your friends are like your mother everybody everybody okay and she said to them come in not naomi call me what which means be there for the almighty has there very bitterly with me i went out what so they saw when naomi was going out rich everything good now she's coming up nothing everybody here i went out full and the lord has brought me home again how empty why then call you me naomi seeing the lord has testified against me and the almighty have done what so as they were coming here things were not as pleasant as rooftop you enter a different zone so when you see things begin to change after you give your heart to the lord you get in the congregation everything good everybody is hugging you oh praise the lord it's good sister we need to comfort the sister and suddenly you will see one of the sister become mean to you don't worry you're only changing the stages don't look at that sister don't get distracted because she might be in the other court or she might be in the camp and the devil begin to use her to make you uncomfortable pray for her don't hate her it is a signal that you are flipping the article from the other court into the holy place everybody okay so now when somebody get mad on you you know what to do right you get to your work you say praise the lord i receive the lord jesus christ now my heart feels so clean you're going to work you thought everything will be good at work as soon as you get to work it looks like things change you talk to somebody i don't want to talk to you he said what have i done is there any problem you wonder you said what happened it looks like what i did that the altar is breaking everything like hell is turn loose we thought it's gonna be easy when i get there we will see a beautiful house me and naomi go sit no roof serving are we okay if you're not taught this thing you're gonna be in trouble and then you get caught up with who hates you and thinks and then you get discouraged and when you get discouraged it looks like since i start getting serious with the lord everything became it's not working good it is a good sign it is a very good sign that you going you are in the right direction because the devil is trying to prove you that the decision you made is wrong so you need to go back because entering justification is gonna begin to deal with the snake you begin to master the snake and the devil doesn't like it he wants you in a justified state when you are hypocrite when you do things wrong and you go and you repent and tomorrow you go back and you do it the same way lord help me where are we at barefooted camera gleaming behind the reaper you gotta clean not any kind of way you cannot go before the reaper this book this book is so loaded it's so loaded you have to be behind [Music] so once you enter sanctification you must stay tight and following the movement of the reaper because you need strength you need food the devil is fighting you and the reaper is there to make the food fall [Music] are you okay do you follow me the reaper has a job to make sure to send the encouragement don't worry god is with you he will start the work on you we will finish it until the day of jesus christ so when you stay cut in church the reaper will continue to bring food that's why you come to church tired you leave church and you feel like you strong again because you just pick up something from the reaper and then you're ready to fight oh my god i am not in one percent of the sermon hallelujah [Laughter] serving and then after she had found water the result of your service we okay the result of your service will end up the product on the end result everybody here it will grant you grace at boaz everybody everybody okay if you notice bars come only after roof have already worked help me everybody here let's continue let's erase everything there now let's start a little blank you ready all right we are dealing with the holy place everybody okay roof is now in the holy place let's put our microscope brother you ready on a computer you ready okay as we zooming out the other the holy place we found out in the holy place depending on how you're looking at there is either two or three furniture hallelujah according to paul in a new testament the holy place according to paul in the new testament we have only two furniture everybody here we have the table of the show bread and we have what the candlestick according to paul anybody here in hebrew chapter 9 verse 2 paul says that there was a tabernacle this is the holy place you already know this language the first tabernacle you have to understand the language of paul we know the tabernacle itself have free space anybody care this whole thing is a tabernacle ever care and paul here is calling this a tabernacle and he's calling that the first tabernacle and this one the second tabernacle everybody okay so you don't get confused paul says that the first tabernacle which is the holy place wherein was the water the candlestick camera and there and the water there is two things there the table and the showbread are connected let's leave it for today which is called the water the holy place is called the sanctuary and it's also called the first tabernacle three names everybody okay same thing father son holy ghost same thing everybody and after the second veil we have the gate everybody here we have the door here which was a curtain here or a veil and we have the second veil here which we talk about so this becomes the first ver and this is the so when paul is saying after the second verse he's telling you in the holiest everybody clear so far so after the second veil the tabernacle he called that also the tabernacle which is the second which is called the water the holiest of all which had the golden censor anybody okay the ark of the covenant we are not there yet so let me stay where we are overlay round about with gold where it was the golden pot that had pot that had the mana and aaron's road divided and the table of the covenant and over eight the caribbean of glory shadowing the mercy seat all of this in the holiest of which we cannot now speak you already know they carry them now when these things were thus ordained you ready the priest went always into the water which was the water the holy place this is the place where the priest was going always over here it's only the high priest you remember once a year the priests were going always in the first tabernacle accomplishing water service everybody okay now roof water the service of who and who entered the priest which door do you use the gate under the king and prince melchizedek and when you enter we all become priests now as a priest you can enter the holy place for service everybody okay and according to moses in the old testament their holy place has three furniture the table of the showbread the candlestick a balkan and what the altar of incense or the golden altar that is called in the new testament everybody here we already dealt with the golden altar everybody here so in the old testament we have the golden altar which we know speaks of water prayer everybody care in the new testament you okay we have the golden altar that is place where inside everybody here everybody here so the golden altar have an ability to move from the holy place everybody okay into the water and the golden altar means what so if you hold on to the golden otter everybody okay so far everybody okay so far if you hold them to prayer when that all to slide everybody okay you will move with that altar into it is a vehicle that is moving taking you from the odd from the holy place into the [Music] your prayer can take you from there into the whole time to the prayer it will glide into the holy spirit and before you know it cornelius cornelius and the prayer cornelius paul under prayer and the prayer call ananias and the prayer because prayer is gliding paul prayer is gliding the other prayer is moving you into the holy place hallelujah all those secrets in the tabernacle and they were still that's why you need the prophet everybody here so far everybody here so once you're there hold on to prayer before you know it you glad easily and you find yourself boom something happened to you ever care because cornelius was praying praying praying pray and that prayer opened the door and brought the vision to peter brought the holy ghost the prayer of paul brought a vision to ananias if you notice paul was praying somewhere else and god spoke to ananias cornelius was praying somewhere else and god went and spoke to her to peter go give him the holy ghost god give him the holy ghost because the daughter can glad and when you get there just he'll stay with that altar when he glides he goes with you and before you know it you find yourself in the presence of god and one of this day something will happen to you ever here ever here something will happen to you and you will be changed and if you're not really carefully careful about it god will send a trial everybody okay the trial that is coming is not to cause you trouble is to just demonstrated you that something happened to you because you know yourself there are certain things you won't tolerate and god will send the trial and when it happen you know yourself that usually when this happen this is the way i react but for some reason when it happen it looks like you powerless everybody here if somebody says certain things you won't take it regardless of who that person is and god will pull somebody to say exactly that it's a trial to prove to you that the snake is already gone everybody okay and when the trial happen instead of you getting upset you begin to laugh you say and the people that know you will look at you and say do you let him talk to you like this you don't even know what to answer and suddenly you say wait a minute this is not me it is not you anymore it is christ that is living in you [Applause] when you don't react you don't even have grudges you don't even go like i'm leaving you because i'm a christian no you are happy you even ready to forgive him you look he said no don't worry brother forgive you don't know what you're doing just don't worry about it they said did you say it that's important it doesn't even bother you at the beginning when they do something it will bother you for days but when that happened you open your heart you say what happened to you are you alive he said i may love you but why are you not upset there is no upset in me anymore so why do you expect me to get upset hallelujah where am i at you finished my time i'm not even where i'm supposed to be i only have few minutes left everybody okay so the president although the order offenses is either here or dead according to paul two according to peter according to moses three so now we already dealt with the altar of essence let's go with the candlestick you ready my time my time my time everybody okay brother you okay on the computer stay tight let's go now to roof chapter two i thought i would preach this move on move on move on move on your roof chapter two naomi if you understand this thing clearly the plan of the redemption is clear your christian life will never be a burden anymore you know where you are you know what you need and when you go to prayer you know what to ask god to help you so you can be where you're supposed to be no rush no trouble nothing your

there is also another dss department how does he work no when you pass into a field then you're hungry you can eat all you want but don't take anything home do you know there was a law in israel for that you eat all you wanted it's not yours you just sit there you eat you eat when you finish but just don't take anything you take anything it's a sin you eat you finish and you go what a jehovah jarrah everybody here the teaching of the old jewish church and when they got there roof remember oh i remember the instruction yes i need to go they didn't tell her wake up in the morning it's time it's time it's time we don't have food to eat automatic ever here let me go to the field of and green ears of corn after him whose sight i shall find what she was looking for what roof everybody clear roof is looking for grace now bakula pretty tight because this is tough everybody here and she said to her go my daughter verse 3 and she went and came and green in the field after the water and her hop you remember this last sunday it happened not just to happen and her help happened to light on the part of the field belonging to boaz so when roof left she went into the field it was a big field anybody care and that field has many places anybody care anybody okay this belongs to this this belongs to this this belong to this this belong to this one anybody care among those filled there was a field of boast roof coming for some reason her step began to go a different direction she just felt like i need to go this way the gps the door the door is working anybody here it's not roof somebody's there who's directing her and then roof begin to go and she just felt like maybe i need to stop here when she stopped on that spot that spot was exactly the spot of boaz that's a miss precise on time and when she stopped right here on the step of boaz boaz was not there he was absent everybody okay so far hallelujah and bars they filled who she stopped where she stopped was of his kindred ali malek verse 4 and behold boss came from bethlehem this is after so ruth got there let me drop oh yeah let's continue from bethlehem and said to the reapers the lord be with you and they answer him the lord bless you then say boaz to his servant that will set over the reaper whose damsel is this anybody here and the servant that was set over the reapers answered and say it is the more badish demsel that came back with naomi out of the country of moab and she ruff said i pray you she is serving i pray you the president uh the altar offenses i pray you let me glean and gather not before but after the reaper among the chief so she came and has continued everybody care even from morning until now and she terry a litter in the house now let's drop this so i'm gonna probably let you here everybody here if you remember who was the husband of ruth marlon the bible says in ruth chapter one that marlon and gee and killian died also both of them and the woman was left of her two son and her husband anybody care the death of marlon was necessary for ruth follow me very carefully the death of marlon the death of malone was important everybody here very important vip it have to happen anybody care because paul says in romans 7 that for the woman which has a husband is bound to the lord to her husband so long as she lives this husband here is your nature that you were born with everybody here whether you were born with the parent in the message or not you all were born by sex so if you born with a parenting message automatically you have a snack in you as pure as your parents are and who that is born of a prostitute is not different than you the only grace you have is your parents are already in the message and they are saving you a lot of trouble versus somebody who's born under a prostitute everybody okay so far everybody good so far blessed be the name of god so that first nature must die that's your first husband and paul said but if the husband be dead she's lose from the law of her husband she's not bound to anything anymore now you're free and while her husband leaveth she and she's being married to another man she shall be called water how many adulterers do we have spiritually in the message because you were born in a message you think you need to go to the holiest you want the holy ghost but you don't want to get rid of that nature you still have the nature of the things of the world and you want the holy ghost to come on top of it that's why it doesn't happen that's why all this time you cannot get the holy ghost sometimes you thought you got in it because you got under an anointed of a good sermon and afterwards your life proved again that you didn't have it because your habit is still the same but i thought over there i felt something you go home you still behaving the same way you missed it because you don't want to let your husband go anybody okay so far now but if her husband your husband is a devilish clean husband because you're born in a message he's dirty but he's clean a little bit by religion he's a stinky husband that you are putting perfume on it to make him smell good but after the perfume is gone the stench should come back again you gotta take him out of you and put him in the garbage can hey but here while her husband leaves her she'll be married to another man she shall be called an adulteress but if her husband be dead she is what and so that she is not adulterous does she be married to another so the death of marlon is very important everybody okay but you ready keep your seatbelt the death of felimelec the death of killian stay closely with me the death of marlon was not the cause that moved now me back home it was necessary but it didn't move now me what moved naomi everybody okay then she arose with her daughters in law that's in my return from the country of moab why aha for seawater she heard in the country of moab like rahab how that the lord has visited his people in giving them water move that allowed me to go back was the news about the bread you want to go home ever here the death is necessary it is important but it didn't move it's what moved was the news about water give me few minutes i'm gonna stop somewhere okay hallelujah i can't even touch the candlestick anybody here in roof one verse 22 the bible said naomi returned and roofed the moabites her daughter-in-law with her which returned out of the country of moab orpa is gone and they came to bethlehem everybody okay in the water of water water body water when they left and they enter bethlehem they enter in the beginning of water everybody okay tighten up pretty good harvest everybody clear means the seed the seed died they were watering the seed and the seeds showed up and you shouldn't go taser bled and shack and the sun at that time is changing the temperature you remember the changing of the temperature of the sun you remember last sunday then at the beginning of harvest the life have left the shack their entire life is now in the grain that's why they can take the ground and make bread [Music] another word in other words are we okay another word when the husband died and they were still in more web it was the planting season the death of the husband is explained by power remember in the old testament we got moses and who we got paul and who everybody okay and we got moses again and elijah going back to the jews and the one who's speaking about the death of the husband is who and which season are we okay are we okay if i lose you raise your hand praise god let me start again we have a delay at the airport there is a traffic so bear with me as i'm turning around the airport i'm trying to land everybody okay so far when they got to bethlehem it was a harvest so meaning that the crop were already planted and the crop already grew and when they grew the crop became mature now they can take the crop and make bread so when they heard the news the crop were already planted but during the time of the planting naomi and roof were still in moab and the death of the husband must happen the gospel of paul must happen over there everybody here you okay you okay let me help you up again the barley season was the bread season the season when fresh bread was being served and the church in this last day not the day of the paul in the last day in the last day through the 2000 year of pagan teaching has come in the water everybody here there is a planting season and a harvest season at the planting season your husband must die i'm going slowly i told you it's tough nobody care and the freshness of life new bread honey out of water honey crust in other words that bread has honey so when you eat it's a sweet bread when the book was handed to john by the mighty angel that put one foot on the sea one foot on the ground and raised his other when when john ate the book it was what like water are we okay are we okay did i lose anybody if i lose you raise your hand okay let me go slowly i am the bread of life your father did eat manna and i did but i am the bread of life that come down from heaven out of heaven if any man eats the bread he shall and the church in the last day here is brought right down at water so burnley or harvest season is the end time because at the end time we are dealing with the fruit when you plant you planting a wheat everybody here at the end of harvest you're receiving a wheat that looks exactly like the wheat that was planted everybody here so they're planting have wheat we okay and the harvest has wheat head wheat and the harvest has wheat that's why brother branham say i preach like malachi 4 come to turn the heart of the children back to the original wit back to the origin of faith the faith i have is exactly the fifth that started over there week to week in between it's something different it is just a journey everybody okay now everybody okay now did i lose anybody hallelujah where are we going anybody clear there is a principle that goes with harvest so if you have a problem now get this and it's going to solve your trouble you ready now in john chapter 4 verse 35 jesus said say not ye they are yet for month and then cometh the what behold i say unto you lift up your eyes and look on there plural for they are white already to what if the other word the grain are mature you cannot make bread with a shack because when you open the shack the seed is not formed yet it looks like the seed but the seed is formed within the shack but here you have to take the seed and make the bread out of it so naomi heard the news that there is bread in other words it is the time of the seed the seed have already matured but the husband are already dead they were waiting for the time of the harvest so they can begin to go everybody okay and there and he that does what refresh receive his water and gather fruit unto water and he the what and he that repeats may water so there is one that's sauce oh my god the principal of a farmer there is a somewhere or a planter with a sowing season and there is a reaper amen which is in the harvest everybody okay so far number one and naomi and ruth went not at the sowing season but at the season of the half of the reapers not the planter but the reapers but the plant have seed and the reaper also have seen the reaper is getting the seed that was planted by the sower the sower plant and he leaves and the reaper comes and recuperates the seed that the sower places so whatsoever one rebirth both of them both of them in the rapture so one of this day brother branham will go to call and say brother park we made it we made it we marry that brother paul thank you for sewing thank you for sewing very good it costs you your head it costs you your life it costs you a lot of building but thank you for sewing because i have the original plan and i know what to expect brother robert this traffic is so heavy i'm trying to land let me land hallelujah i don't know if i have enough gas up there everybody okay everybody okay hallelujah and here is the last saying too one does what and another does what i sent you to reap that where on he bestowed no water so somebody suffered another one is just coming and gleaning everybody here are the man has what and you are enter into the water so when you are reaping you now part of the ministry did i lose somebody forgive me i got to land the plane let me say this and land the plane okay let me say this the first principle of farming there is a sowing or planting and there is a harvest or the ripping everybody okay that's the first principle the second principle is very important amen hallelujah lord help me you understand the field of boars the second principle of the planting the farmer and i have to come back again on this let's say boaz is there boys this is his field anybody clear so roof comes and goes there back here the second principle is of farming jesus said then say heat unto his disciple the harvest is truly plenteous by the water or water pray is therefore the who harvest have a lord of the harvest are we okay there is somebody that is called the principle of army he's called the lord of harvest the lord of harvest is the honor of the field everybody okay hallelujah hallelujah that he shall stand forth water into his water that owner have workers are laborers one two that owner have laborers yes everyone can everybody care these laborers are workers but remember he's the lord of what harvest and harvest we don't have sowers we have reapers anybody here these laborers of the lord of harvest you ready our place in hierarchy all in category everybody they are all workers but they have different levels [Music] anybody here the chief among all the laborers is called the chief reaper he is the supervisor he is the boss not the owner the boss that supervised every reaper do you follow me under him you have others reapers everybody here are laborers and under those reapers you have maintenance are women servant you okay now let me drop my point when roof went into the field the gps told her to go to a certain spot when she went to the spot she went into the field that belongs to boaz but boaz was not there everybody okay everybody okay boaz was absent [Music] and boras left his field in under the hand of the chief reaper do you have your bible open a roof too look at roof too because i don't want you to look like i'm reading something different are you there verse 5 then said boaz to his water few people to his waters that was set over there that's the chief reaper that's the supervisor that's the manager that's the boss everybody here he says to him who is this worker so when boaz has a question about his field [Music] he doesn't go to anybody he doesn't go to any reapers he goes to the chief reaper the reaper that is on top of all the requests and say who is this damsel now that chief reaper begin to speak in other words when roof came in the field roof met the chief ripper everybody okay the chief reaper is the one that gives you permission because he's a steward he's the one that have the masters good like nds of damascus the things of the master belong to him everybody okay so roof and the chip reaper spoke when boaz was not there that's why when boaz is coming back he goes straight to the chief bleeper he said a war is over there so the chief reaper have to give answer your presence must be judged by the word of the chief reaper [Applause] that's why you heard paul saying that you will be judged by my gospel [Music] brother pronoun brother branham are you going there where is jesus christ i want to see jesus christ they thought brother branham they said no jesus is the lord beware but one day jesus will come and he will come to who and he will do what he will judge you with your mind on brandon first and if you william branham i accepted [Music] sower will power also be judged not columba not looter i'm dealing with the seed the one who had the seed is he gonna be judged they say yes he's gonna be judged he said it's god's of power anthem because paul have deceived mine also with your marion branham will also enter because i preach like god let's stop here let's stand let's stand let's stand here keep that in mind okay i'm sorry just stay right there we will pick it up oh my god hallelujah hallelujah roof serving you don't serve any kind of way when you come you must come to the chief reaper because the chief reaper has a report to give to the owner the lord of the harvest can i drop this and we're going to pick up on sunday or next week can i drop this can i drop this roof was going to fund fav grace right when she went there did she find boaz she found who so who will give the grace who gives grace where did he get that grace you don't play with william marion brother you don't play with this message i'm sorry remember where we stop the principle of farming of the harvest let's pray heavenly father lord once again we thank you father for your grace for your love for your mercy father and for everything you have been doing for her father this
