[18:27] Amen the other song
[18:29] you know as brother the Lord has been
[18:32] really opening up to us so many things
[18:34] in the Book of Esther but um what really
[18:37] stands out to me is um
[18:40] the Jewish enemy Naman or Haman rather
[18:44] um
[18:46] even when he realized that he was
[18:48] defeated he still you know he was still
[18:51] coming and holding on to Esther's couch
[18:53] and um it just goes to show that the
[18:55] enemy with that we are dealing with is
[18:57] is very persistent you know he doesn't
[19:00] just um
[19:01] see the timer it says time for me to go
[19:04] I better go and he's not that kind of
[19:05] person
[19:06] you know he'll want to hold on to the
[19:07] last minute
[19:09] so
[19:12] our last enemy is going to be cast out
[19:15] amen
[19:16] in Book of Revelation chapter 12 we see
[19:19] where that woman that was
[19:22] travailing to bring forth and when she
[19:24] brought for that man child she was a
[19:27] great Wonder in heaven but there was
[19:29] another Wonder in heaven too that was a
[19:30] dragon so what is he doing up there
[19:34] when the man child was born and taken up
[19:36] to the throne that's when he was cast
[19:39] down amen The Last Enemy is death and he
[19:42] is riding right now so we have work to
[19:44] do Believers that's what this song is
[19:47] about
[19:49] we're not going to ask him till if
[19:50] you're going to kick him down
[19:52] amen hallelujah
[19:58] [Music]

[45:01] finally she decided to go home so she's

[45:05] amen
[45:08] I was with her yesterday and we were
[45:10] trying to find another doctor just
[45:12] trying to switch things because
[45:13] sometimes you know what happened in the
[45:16] health care but she's doing better I was
[45:18] with her last night we spent some time
[45:20] with her and her husband we prayed and

[45:30] Brother David will tell me let's go to
[45:33] the word of the Lord in Genesis chapter
[45:35] 45.
[45:36] last Sunday we stopped in the Four Keys
[45:41] of the third pool everybody clear that
[45:45] came from Esther
[45:48] if you missed last Sunday
[45:50] and you didn't have a chance to watch it
[45:52] you really really really need to pay
[45:55] attention

[46:01] not in my hand
[46:02] it is in your hand it's up to you to
[46:05] make up your time and find a way to
[46:07] listen to the message or release and
[46:09] again because when we give it here it's
[46:12] usually loaded
[46:13] so you need to take some time and go
[46:16] slowly until you catch up all the spirit
[46:19] is trying to say to the church we
[46:23] appreciate all the family members that
[46:25] are here we don't have strangers in this
[46:28] church

[46:56] your hand Lord's willing we'll do that
[46:57] after service amen praise the name of
[47:00] the Lord Genesis chapter 45 verse 4.
[47:07] we are dealing
[47:09] with the Book of Esther we start from
[47:12] The Stave and we keep soaring deeper
[47:14] into the sky amen
[47:17] so we're getting deeper and deeper and
[47:20] deeper but these things need to be
[47:22] understood by the church if you dare you
[47:25] can say Amen we talk about the adoption
[47:27] of Mordecai which was speaking about the
[47:31] adoption of brother Branham because
[47:33] Mordecai was the type of Branham the end
[47:35] time messenger we show you the apparel
[47:38] of Mordecai how Mordecai have master has
[47:41] a big crown and her brother Branham God
[47:44] give him a huge portion of Heaven which
[47:47] was a domain and bigger anointing of the
[47:50] Holy Spirit I'm going to touch that down
[47:52] quickly and then probably we're going to
[47:54] touch two major keys today of the third
[47:57] pool you heard it third pool third pool
[47:59] third pool you got to know what is going
[48:00] on Amen no more guessing we say third
[48:04] poor we leave the church we don't even
[48:05] understand what we're talking about amen
[48:08] we heard that for 30 years Deadpool
[48:10] Deadpool Deadpool the word thankful
[48:13] Deadpool we need to get it amen
[48:16] verse 4. with respect
[48:20] because I felt checked in
[48:24] amen with respect to my brother
[48:28] amen
[48:29] and Joseph said
[48:34] you know brother Branham say
[48:36] go home
[48:38] and study
[48:40] that's the problem we have
[48:42] we don't study the word
[48:45] amen yes okay
[48:48] you okay
[48:51] and Joseph said to his Brethren you know
[48:53] the adoption of Joseph to put him in a
[48:56] position Pharaoh took his wing and give
[48:59] it to Joseph
[49:00] and the difference between Joseph and
[49:03] Pharaoh was the throne
[49:05] in everything it was Joseph but Pharaoh
[49:08] was still above by the throne amen but
[49:12] the authority of Egypt is under the hand
[49:15] of Joseph so just always keep that
[49:18] throne above
[49:20] when we talk about the end time ministry
[49:22] it is the Lord Jesus Christ but Jesus is
[49:26] still above
[49:27] amen amen and Joseph said to his
[49:31] brethren come near to me I pray you you
[49:34] might be seated
[49:36] and they came near and he said I am
[49:39] Joseph your brother whom you sawed in
[49:41] Egypt now therefore be not grieved nor
[49:45] angry with yourself you know the story
[49:47] that Joseph was sold by his brother
[49:50] because of jealousy everybody clear
[49:54] and when Joseph had the vision from the
[49:57] Lord Joseph saw that he was a star in
[50:01] the middle and there were 11 star bowing
[50:04] down to him he saw there were 11 12
[50:08] Chief and his chief was in the middle
[50:11] and the 11th sheep always were bowing to
[50:14] him
[50:15] so he only that Vision or that dream
[50:19] only spoke about the position of Joseph
[50:26] he just spoke about Joseph being
[50:29] elevated in a level higher than his
[50:33] brethren but that Vision have was
[50:37] locking something in itself that was not
[50:41] plainly revealed
[50:43] everybody clear he revealed that Joseph
[50:46] will be a great man he revealed that
[50:49] Joseph will have a great position but he
[50:52] didn't tell us the purpose of that
[50:56] position
[50:57] amen is he going to be a president is he
[51:01] going to be a vice president is he going
[51:03] to be a supervisor he didn't tell us
[51:06] what the position because once you
[51:09] discover the position you need you can
[51:12] know by the position what is the
[51:16] attribute or the potential that goes
[51:19] with that position
[51:21] if somebody is a president you know what
[51:23] a president is supposed to do if
[51:26] somebody is a governor you know what a
[51:28] governor is supposed to do you know
[51:30] their expansion and you know the
[51:32] limitation so the vision only spoke
[51:35] about their position but the vision
[51:38] never revealed the purpose or the intent
[51:42] of that position everybody clear
[51:46] now Joseph is revealing the intent of
[51:51] the purpose of that position
[51:54] verse 5 now therefore be not grieved nor
[51:58] angry with yourself that you sold me
[52:01] here for God watch it
[52:04] who sent Joseph to Egypt his brother
[52:07] Naturally Speaking amen but Joseph is
[52:11] saying he was not you even though he
[52:14] appeared like you the one that caused
[52:17] them by jealousy but he was God that did
[52:21] it that's why to the Christian all
[52:24] things work together for good amen
[52:29] he says God not you
[52:33] he take it away from his Brethren God
[52:36] did send me before you to do what
[52:41] to preserve life the vision never spoke
[52:44] about preserving life the vision only
[52:46] revealed the position
[52:48] everybody there now Joseph is saying
[52:51] that position was not only for my
[52:54] brother to be bowing down to me and to
[52:57] make me a great man the position the
[53:01] intent of God position in the life of
[53:05] Joseph was to preserve life
[53:09] everybody clear when God bring you to a
[53:13] higher position you need to be able to
[53:16] discern what God is doing God doesn't
[53:19] put you in a higher position for you to
[53:23] take advantage of your brother
[53:25] for you to dominate your brother for you
[53:28] to disrespect the people the reason why
[53:31] God put you to a certain position is
[53:34] because there is a purpose and that
[53:38] purpose is not your purpose but is God's
[53:41] purpose that he put in your life and
[53:45] that purpose must be to preserve life
[53:52] that you're gonna be tempted
[53:55] amen and God allowed two people to come
[53:59] in the church and act crazy
[54:01] and God told God Ibraham you say what
[54:05] you can say and whatever you want to say
[54:07] to those people is going to happen
[54:09] if they need to be dead they're going to
[54:12] be dead right away but the power of the
[54:15] spoken word when he came putting brother
[54:19] Branham in that position did not cause
[54:22] death to those young people but brother
[54:25] Branham preserve life
[54:28] everybody clear
[54:29] their purpose to preserve life
[54:33] for these two years
[54:36] has the famine been in the land and yet
[54:39] there are five years
[54:41] in which there shall be neither hearing
[54:45] nor Harvest watch verse 7. and God send
[54:50] me not you God
[54:53] amen God sent me before you to preserve
[54:59] you a posterity in the earth and to save
[55:03] your lives by a great what
[55:07] he didn't know even that himself
[55:10] through the process of time the Lord
[55:13] unfolded that Revelation to him
[55:15] everybody clear that was before the
[55:17] death of his father let's go to chapter
[55:19] 50.
[55:22] Hallelujah
[55:24] because you need to know how to handle
[55:26] the power of the spoken word amen
[55:32] even though a woman disrespected Branham
[55:35] and God killed that woman brother
[55:38] Branham was still running to the
[55:40] hospital trying to pray for that woman
[55:43] until God sovereignly
[55:46] took that woman away
[55:48] amen he was now brother Branham asking
[55:52] God to kill her
[55:55] the purpose preserving life
[55:59] verse 15. if you dare you can say Amen
[56:03] and when Joseph's brother saw that their
[56:06] father was dead
[56:08] they say Joseph will perhaps hate us in
[56:12] other words that is gone he was the one
[56:15] that was the insurance guy
[56:16] so because he's dead We Believe now he's
[56:19] going to deal with us for what we did to
[56:21] him
[56:22] so that they still having that
[56:24] condemnation going on
[56:27] amen that's why you need the scepter the
[56:30] second time
[56:32] amen
[56:33] praise the name of the Lord and will
[56:35] certainly repay us all the evil which we
[56:38] did to him and they send a messenger to
[56:41] Joseph saying your father did command
[56:43] before he die they're using the father
[56:46] now
[56:47] saying so shall you say to Joseph
[56:50] forgive I pray you now the trespass of
[56:54] your breathing and their sin for they
[56:56] did to you evil and now we pray you
[56:59] forgive the trespass of your servant the
[57:02] god of your father and Joseph wept when
[57:06] they spoke to him they didn't understand
[57:09] me in other words Verse 18 and his
[57:12] Brethren also went and fell down before
[57:15] his face
[57:16] and say behold we be your servant in
[57:19] other words we are we are there please
[57:21] don't kill her we are your servant we we
[57:23] want it to be slave don't take me again
[57:27] father as your son put me like one of
[57:30] your worker you remember the Prodigal
[57:32] Son
[57:33] amen look what Joseph did
[57:36] verse 19 and Joseph say fear not
[57:39] for a mind the place of God
[57:42] but as for you you thought evil against
[57:46] me amen
[57:48] but God
[57:50] meant it to good all things working
[57:53] together
[57:55] to bring to pass as it is this day to
[57:58] save what
[58:00] many people alive not only the Jews but
[58:04] also the Gentile
[58:07] everybody include the purpose of the
[58:10] position of Joseph the higher position
[58:13] was to save life to preserve life
[58:19] Exodus chapter 14.
[58:27] if not they won't drop the third pull on
[58:29] you you're going to kill people
[58:34] amen
[58:36] wait wait when we get to the fourth one
[58:42] like somebody say if they give me the
[58:44] choices of how to write I would say a
[58:47] Lincoln Navigator
[58:52] we will see that
[58:55] Exodus chapter 14.
[58:57] verse 10.
[58:59] everybody here and when Pharaoh Drew
[59:02] nigh the children of Israel lift up
[59:05] their eyes and behold the Egyptian
[59:07] marched after them and they were so
[59:10] afraid and the children of Israel cried
[59:12] out to the Lord and they say to Moses
[59:15] because there were no graves in Egypt
[59:17] have you taken us away to die in the
[59:20] wilderness wherefore have you dealt
[59:22] that's with us in other words you're a
[59:24] deceiver to carry us forth out of Egypt
[59:27] it is not this the word that we did tell
[59:30] you in Egypt saying let us alone the
[59:33] condone with the condition get used to
[59:36] it that we may serve the Egyptian they
[59:39] wanted to serve the Egyptian God say
[59:41] take them away so they can serve me
[59:44] outside of Egypt roof surfing in the
[59:47] land of Judah for he had been better for
[59:50] us to serve the Egyptian can you imagine
[59:54] then that we should die in the
[59:56] wilderness
[59:57] and Moses said to the people fear you
[59:59] not
[1:00:00] stand still and see the salvation of the
[1:00:03] Lord which he will show you today for
[1:00:07] the Egyptian whom you have seen today
[1:00:10] amen you shall see them again no more
[1:00:14] forever
[1:00:15] everybody clear praise the name of the
[1:00:18] Lord verse 14 and the Lord shall fat
[1:00:23] for you
[1:00:24] put your car in neutral remember and you
[1:00:27] shall hold your peace put your car in
[1:00:30] neutral amen
[1:00:32] verse 15 and the Lord said to Moses this
[1:00:36] is the problem
[1:00:37] wherefore in other words why
[1:00:40] are you to me
[1:00:43] speak to the children of Israel that
[1:00:46] they go forward so the situation is

[1:00:52] Moses is going to God and trying to
[1:00:56] plead to God like Esther remember and

[1:01:10] to whom Moses should go to cry if it's
[1:01:14] not to the Lord now Moses is going to
[1:01:17] the only source that he used all this
[1:01:20] time and the sources rebuking him
[1:01:25] you see now there is a time he's going

[1:04:48] two states
[1:04:49] we are still dealing with the benefit of

[1:04:59] for him to be playing around with you
[1:05:01] when God take you from one position to
[1:05:05] another there is always a purpose there
[1:05:08] is something that God is trying to

[1:05:40] the royal priesthood of Melchizedek that
[1:05:44] put you in the presence of the Living
[1:05:46] God inside the inner Court in the holy
[1:05:50] of the holiest amen and we have the
[1:05:53] power of the the Signet the bracelet and
[1:05:56] the child and we are still dealing with
[1:05:59] the power of the Signet as we handle the
[1:06:01] Book of Esther so now we are on part
[1:06:04] eight but throughout the week the Holy
[1:06:08] Spirit reminded me something that I
[1:06:11] needed to talk about it when we spoke
[1:06:13] about the five manifestation of Elijah
[1:06:16] in the life of Mordecai everybody clear
[1:06:20] we found out that when Elijah the spirit
[1:06:23] of Elijah came the first time
[1:06:26] God expressed to Elijah that there were
[1:06:29] people that didn't bow their knee before
[1:06:32] Bell and we found out that Elijah
[1:06:35] resisted our Mordecai resisted him and
[1:06:40] completely and did not want to Bow his
[1:06:44] knee before him and everybody clear
[1:06:46] which in the time of Elijah was
[1:06:49] represented as the devil through the
[1:06:52] gods or the other Bell everybody clear
[1:06:55] then we found out that there was a plot
[1:06:58] that was going on against the king and
[1:07:02] then in that plot Mordecai revealed the
[1:07:05] plot to the king amen and that was the
[1:07:08] appearance of the spirit of Elijah in
[1:07:11] the life of Elisha the prophet then the
[1:07:15] third one we found out that the that
[1:07:17] Hermann wife was revealed and that
[1:07:21] reveal herodia which was dealing with
[1:07:24] John the Baptist because she gave an
[1:07:26] advice to Herman to go ahead and to kill
[1:07:29] Mordecai just like the wife of Herod was
[1:07:32] the one after the head of John the
[1:07:35] Baptist then the fourth Elijah all these
[1:07:38] three manifestations were in the other
[1:07:41] court in the Old Testament because in
[1:07:44] the other court no one was permitted to
[1:07:46] get into the presence of the king
[1:07:48] because he had record the people were
[1:07:50] under the blood of bulls and goats but
[1:07:53] in the New Testament we under the blood
[1:07:55] of Jesus Christ and and the connection
[1:07:58] or the kinship between Esther and
[1:08:02] Mordecai was not revealed but with the
[1:08:05] fourth time or the fourth Elijah
[1:08:07] Ministry we found out that the kinship
[1:08:10] between Esther and Mordecai was unveiled
[1:08:14] in other words the Mordecai or the
[1:08:17] Elijah of the fourth time is also part
[1:08:20] of the bread but yet he was the one
[1:08:23] taking care of Esther everybody clear
[1:08:26] the position are different but they are
[1:08:29] brothers everybody clear then we found
[1:08:31] murder that that Spirit begin to write
[1:08:34] letter to the Jews which is the fifth
[1:08:37] Elijah that goes to the Jews with Moses
[1:08:40] and handle the situation with the 144
[1:08:44] 000. now I will try to draw your
[1:08:47] attention to the second appearing of
[1:08:51] Elijah spirit in the life of Mordecai
[1:08:54] let's take Esther chapter two
[1:08:57] amen

[1:10:32] therefore they were both hang on the
[1:10:35] tree and it was written in the book of
[1:10:38] The Chronicle before the king so when
[1:10:42] Mordecai unveiled the plot that was
[1:10:44] against the king something happened to
[1:10:48] this they took whatever happened during
[1:10:52] that time and they put it as a record in
[1:10:56] the chronicle of the king everybody

[1:11:32] given to the king they spoke about what
[1:11:35] happened in 1994 in 1993 all these years
[1:11:39] nothing attracted the king attention
[1:11:41] everybody clear
[1:11:44] verse 2 and he was found written
[1:11:47] that Mordecai had told of big tana and
[1:11:53] tirish two of the king's Chamberlain the
[1:11:57] keepers of the door who sought to lay
[1:11:59] hand on the king harassers

[1:13:36] so Haman came in and the King said to
[1:13:38] him what shall be done to the man who is
[1:13:42] the king Delight to honor we already
[1:13:43] explained you this now Herman thought in

[1:20:34] are you there
[1:20:36] sir hearing Pages moving
[1:20:39] everybody there
[1:20:41] then the king of Syria
[1:20:45] World against Israel
[1:20:47] and took Casa with his servant
[1:20:51] saying in such and such a place shall be
[1:20:56] my camp
[1:20:57] so the king were making plans
[1:21:00] to attack Israel
[1:21:02] and they say we're gonna Camp right
[1:21:04] there
[1:21:05] verse 9. and the man of God everybody
[1:21:09] know that Manukau don't worry we want to
[1:21:12] find who he
[1:21:13] and the man of God
[1:21:16] sent to the king
[1:21:18] there was a man of God right there that
[1:21:21] communicated to the king to unveil unto
[1:21:25] the king
[1:21:27] the plot the plan that is made against
[1:21:31] him just like Mordecai and fell to the
[1:21:36] king the plot that was made against him
[1:21:40] everybody following me
[1:21:42] amen then the king of uh verse 9 and the
[1:21:46] man of God sent to the king of Israel
[1:21:48] saying be aware that you pass not such a
[1:21:52] place for there the syrians are come
[1:21:55] down

[1:21:59] which the man of God told him and won
[1:22:02] him off and served himself there not to
[1:22:06] us no choice in other words this
[1:22:10] happened many times
[1:22:13] are you following me it didn't happen
[1:22:16] one time every time the king of Syria
[1:22:19] was planning to kill the king of Israel
[1:22:22] the man of God tell him don't go over

[1:22:49] he thought there is a spy and said to
[1:22:51] them will you not show me which of us is
[1:22:55] for the king of Israel in other words
[1:22:58] any time that we make plan somebody is
[1:23:01] busting our plane up so who is here it
[1:23:04] seems like there are spies within the
[1:23:06] army that are telling the king of Israel
[1:23:09] every single plan and that's the reason
[1:23:11] why our plan are not working everybody
[1:23:15] clear

[1:23:19] servants saying

[1:24:04] of Elijah and the second appealing of
[1:24:09] Mordecai action was to unveil the plan
[1:24:13] of the plot against a king everybody
[1:24:16] create now let's continue amen and one
[1:24:20] of his servants say no my Lord now I got

[1:24:24] airport praise God of the King by the
[1:24:27] Elijah the prophet that is in Israel
[1:24:30] tells the king of Israel the word that
[1:24:34] you speak in what
[1:24:36] in other words the spirit of discernment
[1:24:40] is in the life of Elisha amen and that
[1:24:45] is if disclosing the plan to the king
[1:24:49] speak of discernment are you there it
[1:24:54] was that discernment that is brought
[1:24:57] back again the second time
[1:24:59] but the ministry of discernment the
[1:25:02] second time does not only stop under
[1:25:07] discernment it is the son of man
[1:25:10] Ministry and that Ministry is coupled
[1:25:13] with the honor and dignity of the king
[1:25:18] are you there because this end time the
[1:25:22] discernment that was under Elijah that
[1:25:25] discernment came back on brother Branham
[1:25:28] with the spirit of Elijah but when the
[1:25:32] discernment comes the second time
[1:25:34] brother pranam is in Royal apparel
[1:25:36] brother Branham is in the king Ross
[1:25:39] brother brought them were the king's
[1:25:42] Quran that's why he could say I take
[1:25:45] every Spirit here under my control are
[1:25:49] you there brother Branham is doing that
[1:25:51] publicly amen and it's a temporary work
[1:25:56] he looks exactly like Jesus Christ but
[1:26:00] it is not Jesus Christ it is brother
[1:26:03] brother wearing the apparel of the king
[1:26:11] Hallelujah
[1:26:13] let's go the true Easter seal
[1:26:16] and if he can reveal to me by his holy
[1:26:20] spirit then resurrected Christ who come
[1:26:24] here and give me a word
[1:26:27] the work right here was temporary
[1:26:31] he was not permanent the king stayed in
[1:26:35] the palace but he is revealed to the
[1:26:38] public temporarily
[1:26:43] the messages in the Bible
[1:26:46] are you there give me a temporarily
[1:26:49] Resurrection by my spirit
[1:26:51] that my spirit goes away
[1:26:54] because he need to put the king apparel
[1:26:58] amen and his Spirit come in
[1:27:03] are you there
[1:27:04] oh my God then to let you know whether
[1:27:08] he's alive or not now I don't know you
[1:27:13] that's Mordecai that's me me and my
[1:27:17] spirit we don't know you but he's the
[1:27:21] king
[1:27:22] knows you but he want to borrow Mordecai
[1:27:27] he wants to borrow my body to prove that
[1:27:31] he is the resurrecter crossed the king
[1:27:36] stay in the inner chamber but on the
[1:27:39] outside Mordecai is proving that the
[1:27:42] king is a love
[1:27:46] I'm so happy to learn it to him give it
[1:27:49] to him anything he can get out of it but
[1:27:53] if you shall accept the spirit that is
[1:27:56] on me now there could not be enough
[1:27:58] devil in hell because he is dealing with
[1:28:01] the king crown
[1:28:04] make you doubt anymore and you got to be
[1:28:08] here I am not the Healer amen I am only
[1:28:12] on a king's horse I am Mordecai

[1:28:19] public manifestation of the king

[1:36:40] will do that only brother Branham can
[1:36:44] turn the back and design the people
[1:36:47] it is only one person
[1:36:50] we we can heal the sick we can pray for
[1:36:54] the sick we can speak the word but that
[1:36:57] public Revelation manifestation
[1:37:00] discernment of Genesis 18 to turn the

[1:37:31] and the cloud overshadow the Lord Jesus
[1:37:34] and God's folks say this is my beloved
[1:37:37] Son I preach on that here not long ago a
[1:37:41] little message
[1:37:43] here he
[1:37:46] I suppose maybe you have it on tape I'm
[1:37:48] sure and he said that he went up to the
[1:37:52] mountain this is Brother holy Roberson
[1:37:53] the vision that he saw the pickup
[1:37:56] brother Branham and brother Branham went
[1:37:58] and he came back on the Lord's table and
[1:38:01] one of random change this is another
[1:38:03] version of it brother Brian I'm
[1:38:05] explaining in that he says and when he
[1:38:08] did I was standing there
[1:38:11] in the mountain and the voice came from
[1:38:14] the cloud
[1:38:16] was innate brother Roy and said
[1:38:18] something on this order
[1:38:21] about brother Branham this is my
[1:38:24] and I have called him to be a prophet
[1:38:27] today
[1:38:28] to lead the people just as Moses did you
[1:38:33] remember the Simon the Paul's praise the
[1:38:36] name of the Lord and he's been given the
[1:38:39] what
[1:38:40] he could what
[1:38:44] do you get that that's the adoption of
[1:38:47] Mordecai
[1:38:49] now I'm blaming to last Sunday and I'm
[1:38:52] heading everybody clear or something
[1:38:55] like that like Moses did like speaking
[1:38:58] in the Flies and we know about the
[1:39:01] squirrel and so forth and the things
[1:39:03] that's already took place leader had it
[1:39:06] right back there I suppose you know what
[1:39:08] taking place in a house and he told him
[1:39:10] that I have done what Moses has done

[1:39:24] to ask anything

[1:39:30] you it is too deep for my mind
[1:39:34] I know that but I hope in my heart
[1:39:36] intellectually is hard
[1:39:39] but here in my heart can contain as much
[1:39:42] of it as I can
[1:39:44] I have lived on it I have traveled I'm
[1:39:47] going to Westward on it on the right I
[1:39:51] am entering meeting on it I'm living on
[1:39:53] it God's word is
[1:39:56] I'm not going to speak it in his name
[1:39:58] I'm going to speak in the revelation of
[1:40:02] my face
[1:40:03] what happened in Sabino Canyon the other
[1:40:06] day I believe that the hour is
[1:40:09] approaching
[1:40:10] sister Jean when missing lamps won't be
[1:40:14] watching
[1:40:15] and the glorious power of the Creator I
[1:40:19] believe if I can make if he can make a
[1:40:23] squirrel up here that is he here is the
[1:40:26] man or a woman just a part missing in
[1:40:29] other words if God can create a whole
[1:40:32] squirrel how about somebody who's just
[1:40:35] missing a part of an arm

[1:40:42] complete animal in itself God I love him
[1:40:45] everybody clear so now as we enter here

[1:40:52] now where we were and we go
[1:40:55] Hallelujah
[1:40:59] blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:41:10] you want to trace brother Branham let's
[1:41:12] go back to the Bible

[1:41:33] a dangerous grand for message believer
[1:41:36] if a message believer pull you in the
[1:41:39] Bible you are done
[1:41:41] because the interpretation of the Bible
[1:41:44] belongs to them

[1:45:44] when we finish here with this Theory
[1:45:47] we're gonna enter the mystery of
[1:45:49] predestination
[1:45:51] and you're gonna see how where did you
[1:45:54] start
[1:45:55] you don't even have to have a beginning
[1:45:59] you don't even have a beginning
[1:46:01] you always existed

[1:46:27] when Jeremiah said before I was formed
[1:46:30] in mind so where was Jeremiah
[1:46:37] where was Jeremiah
[1:46:39] he was somewhere

[1:46:48] death of only have 10 children but the
[1:46:51] Zodiac was singed Benjamin
[1:46:58] don't worry we will get to the mystery
[1:47:00] of predestination Mysteries yes this
[1:47:04] message is mistress at the sounding of
[1:47:07] the seven Angel out there

[1:47:18] so when you are born you are already
[1:47:21] built for adoption
[1:47:24] are you there you are already programmed
[1:47:28] for a position

[1:47:35] that there is already a position for you
[1:47:39] before your birth
[1:47:42] are you there then the first thing

[1:48:12] are you there then you grow and after
[1:48:16] your growth then your adoption
[1:48:20] amen having predestined us to the
[1:48:24] adoption of the children not of stranger

[2:31:04] long but I just love to lay and breathe
[2:31:07] before him in his
[2:31:11] do you see now
[2:31:13] you see now
[2:31:16] praise the name of the Lord the same
[2:31:18] Daniel that taught them of the event say
[2:31:21] that in the last day the people that
[2:31:24] know their God shall do export
[2:31:26] scripture must be fulfilled if we only
[2:31:29] what
[2:31:30] and if you notice God only reveals
[2:31:35] himself
[2:31:36] to those who search and long to seek him
[2:31:44] you don't care about him he doesn't care
[2:31:47] about you
[2:31:49] matter of fact in his sovereignty he
[2:31:52] still watches over you are you there he
[2:31:55] cares save the Lord and sometimes God
[2:31:59] let things happen
[2:32:01] that's why your Trouble Comes
[2:32:03] so that we will do what
[2:32:08] for God has surely what
[2:32:12] the destination that certain event must
[2:32:14] take place and they will afford just as
[2:32:17] his great time Trump takes it off
[2:32:19] everybody care
[2:32:21] oh praise the name of the Lord
[2:32:23] brother Branham now here is what it is
[2:32:27] friend
[2:32:29] so if you get it you are a Christian
[2:32:33] because you believe that you are a
[2:32:35] Christian
[2:32:36] so the way God comes to brother Branham
[2:32:40] brother Branham went and sit under a
[2:32:43] sycamore tree if you need that coach you
[2:32:45] see me and brother random begin to think
[2:32:49] if you study you go look it up what
[2:32:53] brother Branham was thinking about was
[2:32:56] the scripture ask
[2:32:58] say to this mountain be moved and
[2:33:02] brother brother begin to think
[2:33:03] how can Jesus say say to this mountain
[2:33:07] be more
[2:33:08] but Jesus was not dead yet
[2:33:11] it was before the atonement
[2:33:14] so
[2:33:15] how can he say that and give such great
[2:33:18] power to men
[2:33:19] he was not dead yet as brother Branham
[2:33:22] was doing that
[2:33:24] he broke into God's sovereignty
[2:33:28] you see that then God came
[2:33:31] and say
[2:33:33] that scripture is in the atonement
[2:33:37] body brand I'm asked a question he said
[2:33:39] do you remember the old prophet
[2:33:41] because if it's not on the atonement how
[2:33:43] did Moses spoke
[2:33:46] and flies came
[2:33:47] that atonement was the lamb who was
[2:33:50] slain before the foundation of the world
[2:33:54] then brother Branham said yeah I see he
[2:33:57] said when you are on the pulpit
[2:33:59] Discerning people do you think you're
[2:34:00] the one who do that whatever them say ah
[2:34:03] I said when Elisha
[2:34:07] he was in the Old Testament that's what
[2:34:11] you did in the New Testament don't you
[2:34:13] see that ah see now what are you looking
[2:34:16] for
[2:34:17] square up do you see now that's why
[2:34:21] brother brought them say I never ask
[2:34:23] but it was the thinking the meditation
[2:34:27] upon God
[2:34:29] and then God opened up and give him
[2:34:32] something he was not even thinking about
[2:34:37] are you there amen
[2:34:40] and all settled because he is a high
[2:34:43] priest he is the high priest of your
[2:34:46] confession
[2:34:47] what you confess you are
[2:34:50] word of mammoth
[2:34:52] right word of Mama
[2:34:55] won't you confess you are that's what
[2:34:58] you are
[2:34:59] any man will never leave
[2:35:02] any father or any higher than what he
[2:35:07] believes he's living
[2:35:10] you take a man that is always that is
[2:35:13] talking about drinking what
[2:35:17] the word of Mama
[2:35:19] he talks about drinking he what
[2:35:23] meditation of my heart
[2:35:25] he jumped right into that
[2:35:28] and become a why because this law when
[2:35:34] you don't use them good you're gonna
[2:35:36] attract somebody else

[2:37:10] those who love stories
[2:37:12] guess what you're gonna drop in that
[2:37:15] category
[2:37:17] and before you know it a husband begin
[2:37:19] to run outside with women with women
[2:37:22] he's a brother but he begins to have
[2:37:25] girlfriend
[2:37:26] where is his mind
[2:37:28] are you there how can you be a married
[2:37:31] woman begin to run away where was your
[2:37:34] mind what door did you open who did you
[2:37:38] invite to buy your speaking by your
[2:37:41] reading by your watching by your talking
[2:37:44] by your meditation
[2:37:47] are you there
[2:37:49] are you there
[2:37:51] oh my God
[2:37:55] let's stop here
[2:37:58] foreign
[2:38:05] that's why brother Branham said think on
[2:38:07] that scripture when you are sick think
[2:38:09] on that scripture when you do this think
[2:38:12] on that scripture when you do this think
[2:38:14] on that scripture are you there let the
[2:38:17] word of my mouth
[2:38:19] and the meditation of my heart be what
[2:38:23] pleasing unto the king once he pleases
[2:38:27] the king an anointing job
[2:38:30] are you there an anointing job in your
[2:38:35] car meditate upon him
[2:38:38] in your house meditate upon him in your
[2:38:41] bed
[2:38:42] keep thinking on him the King was
[2:38:45] thinking thinking thinking boom a
[2:38:47] dreamer
[2:38:48] the Lord comes and give it to him
[2:38:51] did the king ask no he was just
[2:38:54] meditating on it
[2:38:55] did the disciples say as we walking we
[2:38:58] want Jesus to come now no they were just
[2:39:00] talking and somebody coming
[2:39:03] as they say I'm gonna draw near to the
[2:39:06] king once she get there the King open up
[2:39:10] himself what do you want brother Branham
[2:39:14] what are you doing here
[2:39:16] what are you doing here what do you want
[2:39:19] you are thinking about what you were
[2:39:22] thinking about say speak to this
[2:39:24] mountain so since that was the subject
[2:39:27] you speak Square because this is what
[2:39:30] you are looking
[2:39:31] if brother Barnum was hunting for lion
[2:39:33] but the bottom would have created the
[2:39:36] lion
[2:39:37] because Abraham was looking for a
[2:39:40] sacrifice God didn't create Square for
[2:39:43] Abraham
[2:39:45] the customers Abraham need and give him
[2:39:49] a rama
[2:39:50] brother Branham was not looking for a
[2:39:53] ram he was looking for square he cast
[2:39:56] Thomas brother Branham
[2:39:58] need and give him a square because faith
[2:40:02] is there
[2:40:03] substance can be anything
[2:40:07] substances like stem cells
[2:40:10] you can make them a liver
[2:40:12] you can make them a heart
[2:40:15] you just program them you say you become
[2:40:17] heart and the stem cell become hard you
[2:40:20] program the stem cell you say you become
[2:40:22] lungs and the same still become lungs we
[2:40:25] need to program those stem cells for
[2:40:27] sister Jane for a new heart let's say
[2:40:32] foreign
[2:40:46] the Four Keys of your third pole the
[2:40:50] first one is the sovereignty of God but
[2:40:54] there is a key to this
[2:40:56] Jonah unto him
[2:40:58] then you're gonna figure it out
[2:41:00] when we get to these you're gonna see
[2:41:03] why did this happen to hearty right
[2:41:06] we always say atira said the right thing
[2:41:08] how did she say the right thing
[2:41:12] why did she say the right thing
[2:41:15] are you there who thought who gave her
[2:41:18] the word to say what you say
[2:41:21] how can the Roman Centurion he just came
[2:41:24] he's a man of order working with
[2:41:27] military people tell them go go go he
[2:41:31] took his work
[2:41:33] situation and explain it to Jesus
[2:41:37] he didn't say Isaiah say
[2:41:45] Church the Roman Centurion didn't say
[2:41:48] Isaiah say you're gonna be healing the
[2:41:52] government should be upon your shoulder
[2:41:53] with your strap we are here the whole
[2:41:56] man Soldier didn't say that
[2:41:58] he didn't say Daniel saying
[2:42:01] are you there he used his military stuff
[2:42:07] but when he gives it to Jesus Jesus said
[2:42:11] what a faith
[2:42:14] now what used to be his job
[2:42:18] is today a scripture
[2:42:22] okay okay
[2:42:25] there is no scripture that says that if
[2:42:28] you touch His Garment he's going to be
[2:42:30] healed
[2:42:32] no scripture the woman just say I tried
[2:42:36] this I trust this I don't have strength
[2:42:39] let me crawl if I can just touch
[2:42:44] which Christian did she use
[2:42:48] which one and when she touched everybody
[2:42:51] was touching nothing when she touched
[2:42:54] Jesus stop and say who touch me
[2:42:59] why did Jesus respond to her
[2:43:04] are you there she didn't touch the man
[2:43:06] she touched the clove of Jesus
[2:43:09] are you there and Jesus turned around
[2:43:12] and say who you need to find what
[2:43:15] because God heaven and changing pattern
[2:43:19] he does not change if you found the key
[2:43:24] and you go back the same way he's gonna
[2:43:27] give you the same result all the time
[2:43:30] [Applause]
[2:43:33] God is predictable
[2:43:35] the unchanging pardon of God now when
[2:43:39] something happened you need to find what
[2:43:41] did he do
[2:43:43] because once you find out you go back
[2:43:45] with the same thing because once God
[2:43:48] approves something he tells you that is
[2:43:50] his way
[2:43:52] that is an Open Door
[2:43:55] that's why the woman in Tennessee say ah
[2:43:58] with a woman Elijah
[2:44:00] I have a baby who's dying
[2:44:03] I'm a with a woman
[2:44:04] where is Elijah
[2:44:06] give me Elijah
[2:44:09] [Music]
[2:44:12] God search where's the anointing of
[2:44:14] Elijah
[2:44:15] Gabriel where is the anointing of Elijah
[2:44:17] it is with brother Branham where is he

[2:44:39] all tell brother Branham is going to sit

[2:44:43] and make sure brother Branham there is a

[3:01:13] where thou has died
[3:01:18] [Music]
[3:01:20] nearer
[3:01:23] [Music]
[3:01:26] mirror blessed Lord
[3:01:32] to thy precious
[3:01:37] bleed inside
[3:01:42] I am thine owner
[3:01:46] I have heard
[3:01:49] thy voice
[3:01:54] thy love to me
[3:02:01] but I long to rise
[3:02:10] [Music]
[3:02:18] foreign
[3:02:24] [Music]
[3:02:37] [Music]
[3:02:43] [Music]
[3:02:51] to thy precious
[3:02:56] [Music]
