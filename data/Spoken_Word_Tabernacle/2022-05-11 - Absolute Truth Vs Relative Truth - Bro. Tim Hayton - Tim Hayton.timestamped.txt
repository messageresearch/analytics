[29:36] i believe he's the one who sucked it
[29:37] before
[29:38] amen good to see you back and good to
[29:40] see everybody back
[29:42] i know it was mother's day's and

[29:51] everybody caught up on the service you
[29:54] catch it
[29:55] pretty good i'm sorry i tried but
[29:58] somebody was pulling in a different
[30:00] direction so lord's willing will try to
[30:02] get how do you get sanctified amen so
[30:06] don't miss anything this is very
[30:08] important because this is where
[30:10] many of the message believers are stuck
[30:13] right there and they don't understand
[30:15] and it's a very big change because it's
[30:18] different than justification
[30:19] justification you justify you still
[30:22] remain sinner
[30:24] on the outside on your outlook you're
[30:27] still struggling but on the inside you
[30:29] already justify you receive a new heart
[30:31] but sanctification will change you
[30:33] completely until somebody can tell that
[30:36] this is a different person but yet it's
[30:39] not the holy ghost yet
[30:41] but it's the holy ghost working on you
[30:43] but it's not the holy it's not the
[30:45] feeling yet
[30:46] but it's still the work of the holy
[30:48] ghost trying to push you into the
[30:50] feeling amen
[30:52] blessed be the name of the lord
[30:54] tonight it's brother team hate on
[30:56] preaching
[30:59] who doesn't know brother tim hayton here
[31:02] almost everybody knows brother tim
[31:04] hayton he's pastoring here he was a
[31:06] deacon with us in living word he was a
[31:09] minister and he was a pastor before me
[31:12] so he's a brother he's home i told him i
[31:15] said brother team hate on you home you
[31:17] preach like home and you also pull like
[31:22] so you know how to pull right i don't
[31:24] have to teach you that amen so let's
[31:26] sing only believe and we call brother
[31:28] tim hayton and he's gonna take his
[31:30] liberty amen continue to pray one for
[31:33] another
[31:34] the days are a little bit difficult
[31:36] things are difficult business running
[31:39] difficult god's price going higher but
[31:42] we have a promise of the spoken word we
[31:44] have a god that knows how to take care
[31:47] of his children in the times of need
[31:50] there is nothing to panic god have
[31:52] everything under control amen so either
[31:56] you can look at the promises of god or
[31:59] you can keep looking at the god's price
[32:01] going higher one will give you blood
[32:03] pressure

[32:13] will cause sickness there is no virtue

[32:18] on the lord jesus christ regardless of
[32:20] what is happening god will take care of
[32:22] his children amen if we sit together

[36:35] will have heard from you so now lord
[36:38] we committed into your hands we asked
[36:40] the lord if we any of us have done
[36:42] anything father that would hinder you
[36:44] that would we as a sinner a trespasser
[36:47] iniquity we ask that it just be placed
[36:49] under the blood
[36:51] in jesus christ's name we ask it amen
[36:54] amen god bless you it's certainly good
[36:57] to see you and good man it's good to see
[36:59] some old familiar faces i told brother
[37:03] robert falbe i said i feel like i have
[37:04] come home tonight i feel like it's a
[37:07] homecoming for me you you don't realize
[37:10] how much i think of many of you uh that
[37:13] we have fellowship together through the
[37:14] years but god has allowed us and
[37:17] permitted us to go our separate ways
[37:19] but that's only for a time and a season
[37:21] because it won't be too much longer i
[37:23] really believe with all of my heart that
[37:25] eternity is just around the corner you
[37:28] know we've been we've been saying that
[37:30] for a number of years now we've been
[37:31] preaching it and believing it but
[37:33] somebody is going to fulfill it
[37:35] somebody's going to take a body change
[37:37] somebody is going to become everything
[37:40] that the word said she is supposed to
[37:42] become right
[37:43] no man can make you become that word i
[37:45] cannot make you become the word but
[37:47] christ himself
[37:49] who spoke the word it was through the
[37:51] lips of a prophet right but it was not
[37:54] the prophet himself that was doing the
[37:56] speaking it was god
[37:58] coming through human lips and breaking
[38:01] the word down to a place that it can
[38:03] change your mortal body i believe that
[38:06] with all of my heart i want to move into
[38:08] something quickly i don't want to take
[38:10] too much of your time many of you has
[38:11] worked
[38:12] and so
[38:13] i know what it's like being a pastor and
[38:15] seeing people's faces when they start
[38:17] getting tired but i believe for just a
[38:20] few minutes if we can move into the
[38:22] spirit realm i believe that time can can
[38:25] can cease for just maybe about 30 or 45
[38:28] minutes to an hour and we'll just see
[38:29] how the lord will lead us one one verse
[38:32] of scripture and then i will let you be
[38:34] seated
[38:34] matthew 28 and 14. it's a little series
[38:37] that i've been in for some time now but
[38:40] there's been a few things that's just
[38:41] come out of it uh we'll read this and
[38:43] then i'll let you be seated matthew 28
[38:46] and 14
[38:47] these scriptures are becoming more real
[38:50] to me than ever before it says for many
[38:53] are called
[38:55] but few
[38:57] are
[38:58] chosen
[38:59] heavenly father lord now we have read
[39:01] your word and the rest now lord is up to
[39:04] you as you walked with the two lord and
[39:06] you and you broke the bread to them lord
[39:09] they recognized that you were with them
[39:11] now lord as you break the bread to us
[39:13] tonight may we realize that you are in
[39:16] our midst in jesus christ's name we ask
[39:19] it amen god bless you may be seated
[39:22] my wife sends her greetings
[39:24] she was going to come with me but
[39:27] you know she's she plays either the
[39:29] organ and the piano and and the pianist
[39:32] was down tonight with back trouble so
[39:34] she filled in at her at the post of duty
[39:37] but she does send her greetings and we
[39:39] bring greetings from agape tabernacle so
[39:42] i believe that we're one body we might
[39:44] be in different locations but the bible
[39:46] says that by one spirit not by one
[39:48] doctrine now but by one spirit are we
[39:51] all baptized into one body can you say
[39:54] amen to that and that is the the spirit
[39:56] of the lord jesus christ if i could take
[39:59] something tonight out of this little
[40:01] this little um scripture reading we've
[40:04] read the text but what we need tonight
[40:06] is we need the holy spirit to give us
[40:08] the context of the text can you say amen
[40:11] but i want to take a title of absolute
[40:15] truth
[40:16] versus relative truth
[40:18] and if i could give it a subtitle
[40:20] tonight i would like to call it running
[40:23] without a message
[40:25] absolute truth versus relative truth and
[40:29] tie and give it a subtitle of running
[40:31] without a message and we i believe we
[40:34] can look at this the scriptures i was
[40:36] talking to your pastor in the back and
[40:38] it's amazing to see
[40:40] how two men don't talk to each other for
[40:42] six months and then when you get to
[40:44] talking you're preaching right down the
[40:45] same line but it's not just happening
[40:47] here and it's not just happening in
[40:49] hickory but it's happening all over the
[40:51] world
[40:52] because the holy spirit is taking back
[40:55] charge of his church again
[40:57] god's true with men god
[41:00] if if i or brother shango does not stay
[41:03] submitted to the holy spirit i expect
[41:06] god to step us aside and put men in
[41:08] place that will get the job done why
[41:11] because we must be eunuchs we cannot
[41:13] plan plant our own ideology we cannot
[41:16] plant our own theology but it must be
[41:19] the pure unadulterated word of god and
[41:22] that because my idea will not change you
[41:25] brother shango's idea will not change
[41:27] you
[41:28] even brother branham's idea will not
[41:30] change you but the word itself delivered
[41:34] through men who have been submitted
[41:36] that's what's going to create a change
[41:38] in every son and daughter of god i did i
[41:41] told the church a while back i said i
[41:43] did not die for your sins i did not shed
[41:46] my blood for you and i do not own you i
[41:49] said but i will not have your blood on
[41:51] my hands because i'm going to tell you
[41:54] the truth if i have to preach to the
[41:56] four walls why because god is going to
[41:59] have a bride he's going to have an elect
[42:01] group of people
[42:02] and i found out that if you're a real
[42:04] son and daughter of god you might mess
[42:06] up you might fall flat on your face but
[42:09] you cannot have the word of god preached
[42:12] too hard to you are you with me now
[42:15] i believe that the spirit of god is
[42:17] identifying the very minute and the very
[42:20] second in which we're living the very
[42:22] hour in which we're living and i i want
[42:25] to look tonight i want to read maybe
[42:27] some scriptures in matthew 22 and this
[42:30] is where we're going to pull this from
[42:32] absolute truth versus relative truth
[42:34] matthew 22 and verse starting at verse 8
[42:37] and we'll finish up on 14 and then we'll
[42:39] look at this little subject and here in
[42:41] just a moment i want to define absolute
[42:45] and relative and you'll see where we're
[42:47] going with this
[42:48] verse 8 says then he saith to his
[42:50] servants the wedding is ready so man
[42:53] didn't set this wedding are you with me
[42:56] now
[42:56] no no no prophet no pastor no teacher no
[42:59] apostle set the wedding this was god
[43:02] himself is the one that set the wedding
[43:05] and he said the wedding is ready
[43:08] but they which were bidden were not what
[43:10] found worthy
[43:12] now that puts the ministry in there as
[43:15] well as the laity because god is not a
[43:17] respecter of persons
[43:19] now watch this because some made an
[43:22] excuse some had their own idea of it
[43:24] some had their own version there was
[43:26] more places now at the table
[43:29] maybe you don't think this way but i
[43:31] believe that the last seat hasn't come
[43:33] in and i don't necessarily believe it's
[43:35] sitting in a message church it might be
[43:37] the prostitute on the street it might be
[43:40] the drug addict that's in rehab it might
[43:43] be the drunkard on the street it might
[43:46] be somebody sitting in a denominational
[43:48] church why because god knows those that
[43:52] are his
[43:54] see god's through with the me and my for
[43:56] and no more attitude
[43:58] i don't know who is and who ain't i'm
[44:00] just going to cast the net
[44:02] and if they're on the street we need to
[44:04] be willing to witness into them
[44:07] you know what's happened we become so
[44:09] elevated in our doctrine we become so
[44:12] elevated in our teaching that we thought
[44:15] we knew something but come to find out
[44:16] we don't i listen the older i get i know
[44:20] very little anymore what i do know is i
[44:22] know him and him alone and what he
[44:25] reveals to me that's going to produce
[44:28] all my ideas ain't going to produce
[44:30] nothing all my ideas is going to get
[44:32] people tangled up i can't even keep my
[44:34] own self straight at times
[44:36] i'm depending upon the holy spirit to
[44:38] lead me he said when he the spirit of
[44:41] truth is come he will lead you into all
[44:44] truth what is truth the truth is the
[44:47] person of jesus christ in the form of
[44:50] the holy spirit today i asked the church
[44:52] i said somebody tell me what the message
[44:55] is
[44:56] [Music]
[44:58] well i received the word for my day i
[45:00] said which word whose version of the
[45:03] message are you going to receive you've
[45:05] got this version you've got this
[45:07] doctrine i said if what we believe does
[45:10] not produce the life of jesus christ we
[45:13] have the wrong message
[45:16] oh yes i said we have the wrong message
[45:20] listen young people doctrine ain't gonna
[45:22] save you
[45:23] doctrine ain't gonna fill you with the
[45:25] holy ghost
[45:26] brother branham said it like this he
[45:28] said in order for paul to get the holy
[45:30] ghost he said he had to lay aside every
[45:32] bit of his teaching
[45:35] i asked the church i said have you
[45:37] received the holy ghost since you
[45:39] believed that the seventh seal was open
[45:41] have you received the holy ghost since
[45:43] you believed that god sent a prophet see
[45:46] we don't get to bypass any of these
[45:48] things god does not change this
[45:50] prescription he never will change his
[45:52] prescription the word which is the light
[45:55] reveals the unbelief in our lives and we
[45:57] either have to line up or we ain't gonna
[45:59] make it
[46:02] listen it's not based on what you
[46:04] believe but it's based on who you know
[46:07] are you with me if you don't know to
[46:09] know him as life not to know the word
[46:12] because you can know the word from here
[46:14] brother branham said you can learn this
[46:16] message that we're trying to teach
[46:19] you can have it locked into here but if
[46:21] it don't ever produce something it's
[46:23] it's another seed is what it is
[46:27] oh hallelujah
[46:29] what says she said go you therefore into
[46:32] the highways
[46:33] [Music]
[46:34] oh my
[46:36] and as many as you shall find bid them
[46:39] to the marriage
[46:40] in other words they ain't given a
[46:42] specific invitation but it's the
[46:44] whosoever will
[46:47] oh hallelujah whosoever will
[46:49] you know what i will not re i will not
[46:52] separate the message from this
[46:54] because this and the message are one
[46:56] that's our problem
[46:58] because we have separated it from this
[47:01] we've been able to interject man's ideas
[47:04] into it and it's caused confusion it's
[47:07] called shipwrecks it's caused people to
[47:10] backslide but if we'll preach this in
[47:13] the unadulterated form it will reproduce
[47:16] the life of jesus christ every single
[47:19] time
[47:21] oh hallelujah
[47:23] i might not make it but it ain't gonna
[47:25] be because i'm not preaching the truth
[47:28] hallelujah
[47:30] listen so those servants went out into
[47:32] the highways and they gathered together
[47:35] as many as they found i like this both
[47:37] good
[47:39] and bad
[47:41] both good and bad
[47:44] oh hallelujah
[47:46] both good and bad and the wedding was
[47:49] furnished with guests
[47:51] hallelujah and when the king now watch
[47:53] this came in to see the guest
[47:56] there was a man he saw there a man which
[47:58] had not owned a wedding garment if i
[48:01] could say it this way that man heard the
[48:03] same message
[48:05] he quoted the prophet's quote
[48:08] but he thought he had a better idea of
[48:10] it
[48:11] and you know what he found himself
[48:14] speechless in the midst of the king
[48:17] oh hallelujah
[48:20] listen it wasn't just like he wandered
[48:22] up
[48:23] he heard the invitation as well
[48:26] but he found a better way and he thought
[48:28] he could get in except god's provided
[48:30] way and it will not work god's provided
[48:34] way ain't my way god's provided way is
[48:37] not your way
[48:39] god's providing way wasn't even brother
[48:41] branham's way god's providing way was
[48:44] his own way
[48:46] hallelujah are you with me now
[48:50] he was found and he was come to bed but
[48:53] he came his own way
[48:55] now watch this god and he said unto him
[48:57] friend
[48:59] he never called him a heathen he never
[49:01] caught him a heart of it he said friend
[49:04] you heard the same message but you put
[49:06] your own interpretation to it
[49:09] listen if you're a son and daughter of
[49:11] god you don't mean me to interpret the
[49:13] word of god
[49:15] listen how many times have you heard a
[49:17] sermon that brother brandon priest said
[49:19] you did not understand it why even
[49:21] though he was a divine revealer of the
[49:23] word there's only one that could break a
[49:25] revelation to you
[49:27] and that's the one that birthed you
[49:29] that's the one that chose you that's the
[49:31] one that called you to be a son and
[49:33] daughter of god it takes god himself
[49:36] that delivered the message to a prophet
[49:39] to break the same word to you or it's
[49:41] not the same message
[49:43] hallelujah
[49:45] how camest thou in hither not having a
[49:48] wedding garment and he was speechless
[49:51] then the king said unto the servants
[49:54] oh hallelujah bind him hand and foot
[49:57] and take him away and cast him into
[49:59] outer darkness there shall be weeping
[50:01] and gnashing of teeth for many are
[50:03] called in other words many had
[50:05] invitation to the wedding supper but
[50:08] there was just a handful that's been
[50:10] chosen to sit at the king's table
[50:12] because he could look down through the
[50:14] stream of time you know why you can say
[50:16] i've been chosen you looked he looked
[50:18] down through the stream of time and he
[50:20] watched when the unadulterated word was
[50:22] presented to you
[50:24] he's seen your reaction to it and
[50:27] therefore he said irregardless of your
[50:29] mistakes
[50:30] oh hallelujah irregardless of your
[50:33] failures
[50:34] irregardless of your iniquities when you
[50:37] know you shouldn't have done it but you
[50:39] did it anyway
[50:40] i have chosen you
[50:43] i have called many but i have chosen you
[50:46] oh you know what we're in the same place
[50:49] that the disciples were when jesus
[50:52] turned he gave his word in john 66 66
[50:56] in mark chapter 10 or luke chapter 10 it
[50:59] said he the harvest was plenteous right
[51:01] it was ready and he said he appointed
[51:04] some
[51:05] but they were not called they were not
[51:07] chosen to it why because in john 6 when
[51:10] he gave them the hard sayings they
[51:13] turned and walked away
[51:15] and then he turns to look at the one
[51:17] he's chosen he said i have chosen 12 of
[51:20] you
[51:21] and one of you is a devil that's where
[51:23] we're at right now god already knows who
[51:25] you are but he's got to reveal to you
[51:27] who you are
[51:29] because you've got to stand in this hour
[51:31] they ain't no man can decide this for
[51:33] you
[51:34] your pastor don't get to decide this for
[51:36] you it's you and god and god alone
[51:40] you can argue with me all you want to on
[51:42] marriage and divorce you can argue with
[51:44] me all you want to on the seals but if
[51:47] god don't come and bring you revelation
[51:49] you've got pure intellect and it will
[51:51] take you straight to the gates of hell
[51:54] but he said i will build my church
[51:57] up on a revelation and the gates of hell
[52:00] shall not prevail against it
[52:02] hallelujah
[52:04] he's building it up on christ in you
[52:08] not christ justin a prophet
[52:10] but christ in you the hope of glory
[52:14] hallelujah
[52:16] oh hallelujah
[52:19] maybe i'm just getting too old
[52:21] or i'm getting too bold but i don't have
[52:24] nothing to lose
[52:25] i don't care about being the most
[52:27] popular preacher
[52:28] and i ain't after money cause i ain't in
[52:31] it for the money and i ain't after
[52:33] another woman god gave me the woman that
[52:35] i need
[52:36] i mean it because he called me chose me
[52:38] to it and because he
[52:41] first loved me
[52:43] now i don't have a choice but to sound
[52:46] the trumpet why
[52:48] not because i want to not because listen
[52:51] i don't care what people think of me
[52:53] anymore i just want to know are you
[52:55] pleased with me lord

[53:18] please you at agape tabernacle i don't
[53:20] care what you think about me
[53:22] i wanna if it skins me let it skin me
[53:26] if it skins you let it skin you but let
[53:29] the word of god be word of god

[56:07] men's ideas
[56:09] or the characteristic of a ruler or
[56:12] authority or a group of men

[56:22] denomination
[56:25] not in a mess brother bam said the
[56:27] message would never denominate but he
[56:29] never said those devils
[56:32] wouldn't worm their way into our
[56:34] churches
[56:39] brother jason rorke he's a minister at
[56:41] the church he said something i use and i
[56:43] hang on to he says you know what we've
[56:45] done for years he said we've had
[56:47] favorite quotes
[56:49] and he said we've used them like a
[56:50] concealed carry weapon he called it a
[56:52] concealed carry quote when somebody says
[56:55] something bam we quoted off the hip
[56:58] pam i got you bam i got you
[57:01] maybe you ain't got nobody you know who
[57:02] it's going to be that makes it it's
[57:04] going to be the nobodies
[57:08] it's going to be the nobodies and the
[57:09] preachers and the laity
[57:13] [Music]
[57:14] oh hallelujah
[57:17] it's completely from constitutional
[57:20] or other restraint it's standing alone
[57:22] without being modified
[57:27] oh god don't need my interpretation to
[57:30] it he don't need your interpretation to
[57:32] it he interprets his own word by
[57:35] bringing it to pass he said there's
[57:37] gonna be a bride and right now because
[57:40] she's moving to adoption are you hearing
[57:42] me the word is bringing you and i to
[57:45] adoption it's beginning to scrutinize
[57:48] what we watch it's beginning to
[57:50] scrutinize our very thoughts it's
[57:52] beginning to scrutinize how we think
[57:54] about one another
[57:58] [Music]
[58:00] maybe i'm crazy but this is what i
[58:02] believe
[58:04] now watch this it's being
[58:05] self-sufficient and free of external
[58:09] references or relationships
[58:13] see this thing ain't no buddy system
[58:22] it's been a buddy system for quite some
[58:23] time
[58:24] we still got a few preachers i'm just
[58:26] going to be honest it carries that same
[58:28] spirit that they think oh well worry i'm
[58:30] sorry you ain't hit
[58:33] you know who's it that little housewife
[58:35] that thinks she's nothing
[58:37] that that that little that little
[58:39] teenager it's got the holy ghost and god
[58:41] do i even have it
[58:43] am i i'm struggling to even believe if
[58:45] i've been born again god says hang on a
[58:47] little bit i'm going to show you
[58:48] something
[58:49] there brother boom said there is no big
[58:51] eyes
[58:52] and there are no little used we are all
[58:54] equal on the same playing field
[58:58] oh hallelujah
[59:00] so when we think of an absolute it's
[59:02] constant
[59:04] the supreme court of the land
[59:06] when they make a ruling it stands
[59:10] most the time it never gets changed why
[59:12] because it's of the highest order
[59:14] it's an absolute of the
[59:16] land think about a traffic light
[59:20] it's an absolute
[59:23] it turns red and traffic's flowing from
[59:26] the other side and you try to go through
[59:28] it what happens
[59:29] you find out real quick that it is an
[59:32] absolute
[59:34] a bullet leaving a gun is an absolute
[59:38] ain't nothing can turn it back why
[59:40] because it's going to hit its target
[59:44] see and understand that an absolute
[59:47] carries penalties with it
[59:52] now watch this when you look at relative
[59:54] or if i could use the other word
[59:56] relational the only definition i found
[59:58] in the very definition says it's not an
[1:00:01] absolute
[1:00:07] an absolute stands alone but a relative
[1:00:10] it's not independent or absolute
[1:00:14] watch this now
[1:00:15] when we look at relational and i want to
[1:00:18] bring this home here for just a minute
[1:00:19] the word relational means relating to
[1:00:23] using or being
[1:00:25] a method of organizing data
[1:00:28] into a database so that is perceived by
[1:00:31] the end user as a set of tables
[1:00:34] so if i could say it this way it's a
[1:00:36] method by which information is put to
[1:00:39] together so a person can use it that is
[1:00:41] not an absolute
[1:00:44] because a set of tables when a new
[1:00:47] discovery is made it can be changed
[1:00:52] i said it can be changed
[1:00:55] but not with an absolute
[1:00:57] you know why because somebody could come
[1:00:59] along and provide a better method
[1:01:02] it's relative it's not
[1:01:04] an absolute
[1:01:06] so absolute truth i want you to
[1:01:08] understand is by revelation
[1:01:11] it stands alone it's independent
[1:01:16] he told peter he said no man has told
[1:01:19] you this but my father which is in
[1:01:21] heaven hath revealed this to you and
[1:01:24] upon this will i build my church
[1:01:28] oh hallelujah a relative or relational
[1:01:32] truth of a cassette this way is a study
[1:01:35] of spiritual things from a formal or an
[1:01:38] intellectual perspective and a gathering
[1:01:41] or collection or a collection of ideas
[1:01:44] so a person can use it for their benefit
[1:01:50] and when i need it to fit me again i'll
[1:01:53] change it again
[1:01:55] to make it fit my under brother branham
[1:01:57] said we can never bring god down to our
[1:01:59] understanding of the new birth he said
[1:02:02] we have to come up to god's
[1:02:03] understanding of the new birth in order
[1:02:05] to get it
[1:02:07] are you with me we can never bring god
[1:02:09] down but we got to come up to god
[1:02:12] and the only way that you and i can come
[1:02:13] up it must be he is the one that drawing
[1:02:16] he
[1:02:17] paul said it is the goodness of god that
[1:02:19] leadeth thee to repentance you can't
[1:02:21] even repent except god calls you to
[1:02:25] repentance
[1:02:31] when i seen this relation or relative
[1:02:33] truth i said jail that's like
[1:02:34] assimilating doctrines
[1:02:36] assimilating quotes and data and going
[1:02:39] through and collecting these pieces and
[1:02:41] putting it together and drawing a
[1:02:42] picture
[1:02:43] but the problem is i see a lot of times
[1:02:45] it just don't produce god
[1:02:51] when brother brown come on the scene he
[1:02:52] preached he preached the message it
[1:02:54] produced jesus christ
[1:02:57] and if your belief in my belief i told
[1:02:59] the church i said you say i believe
[1:03:01] doctrine i believe this i believe this i
[1:03:03] said if your life
[1:03:05] could be played out in a movie after you
[1:03:07] said that i said would we see the life
[1:03:10] of god being on this place
[1:03:12] if not it's just a belief it's an idea
[1:03:15] and you might as well be a catholic you
[1:03:17] might as well be a lutheran
[1:03:19] setting in a message church see the
[1:03:21] message isn't what i'm coming to find
[1:03:23] out the message that i thought was the
[1:03:25] message wasn't the message
[1:03:32] listen
[1:03:33] some say well the word is my absolute
[1:03:35] some says the message is my absolute
[1:03:37] some says the bible is my absolute some
[1:03:40] people say well brother branham is my
[1:03:41] absolute and i say to that that's only
[1:03:44] partial truth
[1:03:47] because if it's not revealed to you
[1:03:50] somewhere along the line something's
[1:03:52] going to come in on you
[1:03:54] i said something's going to come in on
[1:03:56] you and now you're going to change it to
[1:03:58] fit your condition instead of letting
[1:04:00] god come to the condition and change it
[1:04:04] i said if somebody can convince you into
[1:04:06] it somebody will convince you out of it
[1:04:13] i'm not looking for proof
[1:04:16] because if i find proof god somebody
[1:04:19] else will give me a better proof
[1:04:22] i'm looking for revelation
[1:04:25] from god himself
[1:04:27] because when he gives it no man can take
[1:04:30] that from me
[1:04:40] matthew 24 listen to this
[1:04:42] and except those days should be
[1:04:44] shortened there should be no flesh saved
[1:04:46] but for the elect's sake
[1:04:48] those days shall be shortened
[1:04:51] now watch this but if any man shall say
[1:04:53] unto you lord christ is here
[1:04:56] christ is in my doctrine
[1:05:02] are there
[1:05:04] you got to go hear this brother you got
[1:05:06] to go to this camp you gotta go to this
[1:05:08] meeting
[1:05:09] no you just gotta find him in your word
[1:05:12] you find god where you're looking for
[1:05:14] him
[1:05:16] i'm not against any of those things
[1:05:19] but why can't you find god here
[1:05:23] if you're looking for some preacher to
[1:05:24] bring god to you
[1:05:26] oh my god i'll let that preacher go away
[1:05:35] then if any man shall say unto you lord
[1:05:37] hear us christ are there he says believe
[1:05:39] it not
[1:05:40] oh hallelujah for there shall arise the
[1:05:43] false christ
[1:05:45] and false prophets and shall grow show
[1:05:47] great signs and wonders in so much that
[1:05:49] if it were possible
[1:05:53] i said if it were possible they shall
[1:05:56] deceive the very elect
[1:06:01] listen somebody is not going to deceive
[1:06:04] me with trinitarianism
[1:06:08] not going to deceive me with three gods
[1:06:10] are you with me now
[1:06:12] somebody is not going to see me because
[1:06:14] they say it's not true and turn away
[1:06:16] from him
[1:06:17] but where the deception lies
[1:06:21] i said where the deception lies
[1:06:25] how can two preachers
[1:06:27] take the same message
[1:06:30] and the same quote and make it say two
[1:06:32] entirely different things
[1:06:35] the deception is not coming out there
[1:06:38] but the deception is right in our own
[1:06:40] churches
[1:06:48] it don't matter to me anymore god has
[1:06:50] opened my eyes and i see it according to
[1:06:52] the scriptures the deception is not out
[1:06:54] there but the deception is right amongst
[1:06:57] us and the only way you're going to
[1:06:59] discern what's going on is you're going
[1:07:01] to have to have the holy ghost
[1:07:03] and if you don't have the oil you better
[1:07:05] get it you better not hang on to
[1:07:08] something because you believe x and i
[1:07:10] believe this a lot of people has
[1:07:12] believed this and a lot of people has
[1:07:14] believed that but do they have the real
[1:07:17] this and do they have the real that
[1:07:19] which is the life of god himself
[1:07:23] [Applause]
[1:07:26] behold i have told you before wherefore
[1:07:29] if they shall say unto you behold he is
[1:07:31] in the desert
[1:07:32] go not forth
[1:07:34] behold he is in the secret chambers
[1:07:39] come over here brother
[1:07:41] and this don't even have to be
[1:07:43] ministry this can be one lent you know
[1:07:44] let me tell you what i see
[1:07:48] let me show you what the lord showed me
[1:07:50] if what they're showing you don't line
[1:07:52] up with the word
[1:07:57] see many people know this real well
[1:08:00] but i'm finding not too many people know
[1:08:02] this
[1:08:03] very well
[1:08:11] believe it not verse 27 as far as the
[1:08:13] lightning cometh out of the east and
[1:08:14] shining even into the west so shall also
[1:08:17] the coming of the son of man be
[1:08:19] for wherever the carcass is watch there
[1:08:22] will the eagles be gathered together
[1:08:24] where is he saying where the carcass is
[1:08:27] we're the real food of god he said if it
[1:08:30] were possible
[1:08:32] [Music]
[1:08:34] where did satan come down in in the
[1:08:37] guard he came down in god's creation and
[1:08:40] brought the first deception
[1:08:42] he didn't give eve some different word
[1:08:45] he changed one word
[1:08:48] of the act he changed one word of the
[1:08:50] original word to the church of that day
[1:08:53] and when it did it produced death that's
[1:08:55] the reason you're sick today
[1:08:58] that's the reason you're having
[1:08:59] struggles today because one word was
[1:09:01] changed
[1:09:07] listen deception
[1:09:09] comes not apart from the word
[1:09:12] but it tries to come through the word
[1:09:19] i'm going to read you a quote we know
[1:09:20] this i've got so much i'm going to try
[1:09:22] to skim over it but
[1:09:24] you're making it real easy tonight to
[1:09:26] just get out of the way
[1:09:28] when brother branham talks about the
[1:09:29] church knowing who she is
[1:09:31] listen to what he said there's four
[1:09:33] things
[1:09:34] and i told the church i said there's
[1:09:36] four parts to this quote and we got to
[1:09:38] look at all four parts of it well when
[1:09:40] she recognizes who she is she'll become
[1:09:42] an invincible army that's only part of
[1:09:45] it
[1:09:46] listen to what he says right here he
[1:09:48] said he knows that if the people get the
[1:09:50] true revelation
[1:09:52] first of the true church
[1:09:56] that's number one and number two is and
[1:09:59] what she is and what she stands for
[1:10:05] you know what god's doing he's doing
[1:10:07] every one of us like he did with elijah
[1:10:09] in the bible
[1:10:10] he's making you stand alone with him
[1:10:12] first and you feel like you're the only
[1:10:14] one that's seeing it
[1:10:16] he's you oil ain't nobody everybody else
[1:10:19] is turned away but i'm the only one god
[1:10:20] says quit crying i've got a whole bunch
[1:10:22] more that ain't turned back yet but i
[1:10:24] had to get you to stand with me alone
[1:10:27] it's not a buddy system it's between you
[1:10:30] and god and god alone and when you stand
[1:10:33] then all of a sudden now you're fit to
[1:10:35] fight because you're not going to depend
[1:10:36] upon somebody else and the other brother
[1:10:39] sees it another brother sees it and then
[1:10:41] we begin to leak up as the army of god
[1:10:43] god back in flesh again and we're not
[1:10:46] going to be swayed by every wind of
[1:10:48] doctrine but we're going to have spirit
[1:10:50] and truth you can have the truth but you
[1:10:52] could your churches can be devoid of the
[1:10:54] spirit of god and it's still dead even
[1:10:57] though every service the truth is being
[1:11:00] preached the right quotes the right
[1:11:01] scripture but he told the woman at the
[1:11:04] well he said you don't even know what
[1:11:05] you're worshiping she quoted him moses
[1:11:09] message but she did not have revelation
[1:11:12] of it
[1:11:14] he said they that worship him must
[1:11:16] worship him in spirit and in truth
[1:11:22] what she stands for and that she can do
[1:11:25] the greater works she will be
[1:11:27] an invincible army said if they hears
[1:11:29] the third part get a true revelation of
[1:11:32] the two spirits
[1:11:35] of the two spirits working within the
[1:11:38] framework of the christian church
[1:11:41] i told the agape tabernacle i said let
[1:11:43] your pastor bring this home this morning
[1:11:46] i said we've got to discern the two
[1:11:47] spirits working within the framework of
[1:11:49] the
[1:11:50] church
[1:11:53] [Applause]
[1:11:56] i said the church
[1:11:59] oh i can see where you're off
[1:12:01] but i can't ever see where i'm
[1:12:03] [Music]
[1:12:06] off you know what i told agape
[1:12:09] tabernacle i said i don't have all the
[1:12:11] answers and i'm not afraid to tell you i
[1:12:13] don't have all the answers that keeps me
[1:12:15] out of i said but i'll tell you one i'm
[1:12:17] in contact with the one who's got them
[1:12:19] all
[1:12:20] i said whatever you have need of your
[1:12:22] pull i said god will give a man an
[1:12:25] answer and he don't even have a clue
[1:12:26] what he's doing
[1:12:28] why because it's god coming to his wife
[1:12:34] a true revelation of the two spirits
[1:12:36] within the framework of the christian
[1:12:37] church watch this and by god's spirit
[1:12:40] discern
[1:12:43] and withstand
[1:12:45] the antichrist spirit
[1:12:51] i'm sorry
[1:12:53] but there is no more ride in the fence
[1:12:54] post anymore
[1:12:58] it's not between you and some gifted
[1:12:59] preacher anymore
[1:13:02] well i just don't want to hurt the
[1:13:03] feelings i told the church i said i'd
[1:13:05] rather hurt you i said if you can get
[1:13:06] mad at me it get mad enough for me to
[1:13:08] examine and see if i'm telling you the
[1:13:10] truth
[1:13:11] i said don't be stuck here swallowing
[1:13:12] what i preached to you every sunday you
[1:13:14] need to be home reading your bible you
[1:13:17] need to be home listening to the message
[1:13:19] for yourself to make sure i'm preaching
[1:13:21] you the truth
[1:13:23] listen that's how the devil has been
[1:13:25] able to get into our churches for so
[1:13:27] long because we have all including the
[1:13:30] preachers been too lazy and we cannot
[1:13:33] recognize when the devil comes in
[1:13:36] because we don't know the word of god by
[1:13:38] the spirit of god
[1:13:41] [Applause]
[1:13:45] you don't ever have to ask me back if
[1:13:47] you don't want to
[1:13:51] listen to this
[1:13:54] when god found gideon
[1:13:56] he found gideon hiding
[1:14:01] you know why he found him hiding
[1:14:03] he found this little quaking believer
[1:14:06] and he said if god be with us
[1:14:09] then where are all the miracles at
[1:14:12] listen i'm not going to take the time
[1:14:13] because i don't want to take your time
[1:14:15] but i want to just address this he said
[1:14:18] did not the lord
[1:14:19] so he was asking god he wasn't asking
[1:14:22] the prophet now he wasn't asking the
[1:14:24] preacher he wasn't asking the pastor he
[1:14:27] wasn't asking a missionary apostle or a
[1:14:30] minor prophet he was asking god to
[1:14:32] himself
[1:14:34] he said if it be the lord that brought
[1:14:36] us up from egypt he said but now the
[1:14:38] lord hath forsaken us and delivered us
[1:14:40] into the hand of the midianites and
[1:14:42] because he asked god personally
[1:14:46] i said because he asked god personally
[1:14:50] god came to him and began to talk to him
[1:14:54] oh hallelujah and god begins to talk to
[1:14:56] him a little bit and he tells him it's
[1:14:58] just surely
[1:14:59] i will be with thee
[1:15:02] and thou shall smite the midianites as
[1:15:04] one listen gideon had what he had been
[1:15:07] taught of moses's message are you with
[1:15:10] me now
[1:15:11] do you realize when the pharisees argue
[1:15:13] with jesus you realize they were quoting
[1:15:16] moses's message to him where do you
[1:15:18] think they got their traditions from it
[1:15:21] wasn't some made up something but the
[1:15:23] affairs we pharisees they had a
[1:15:25] collective the history says it was
[1:15:28] eclectic ideas in other words they took
[1:15:31] moses's message and they began to mix
[1:15:33] other things within it and it produced
[1:15:35] their own relative religion but when god
[1:15:39] in flesh stepped back on the scene
[1:15:41] they would come to him quoting moses's
[1:15:43] message but god would say but i say unto
[1:15:46] you and if it wasn't saving for the
[1:15:49] cause of fornication this is the only
[1:15:51] reason
[1:15:52] and that same spirit will stand today
[1:15:55] and argue with the word face to face why
[1:15:58] because we all want our we have all gone
[1:16:00] astray
[1:16:02] hallelujah
[1:16:06] gideon built an altar
[1:16:08] and called it jehovah shalom god of
[1:16:10] peace who removes fear
[1:16:12] verse 25 says and it came to pass the
[1:16:14] same night that the lord said unto him
[1:16:16] watch this
[1:16:17] take thy father's block even the second
[1:16:20] bullock of seven years old and throw
[1:16:22] down the altar of baal
[1:16:24] that thy
[1:16:25] father
[1:16:30] the one who knew moses
[1:16:40] and cut down the grove that is by it
[1:16:45] the reason for gideon having a relative
[1:16:49] or a relational truth and not an
[1:16:51] absolute
[1:16:53] it was because of his father that come
[1:16:54] before him
[1:16:57] his father was trying to worship jehovah
[1:17:00] and belle
[1:17:01] at the same time and the bible says that
[1:17:03] a double-minded man
[1:17:05] is unstable
[1:17:09] in all
[1:17:10] not some but in all
[1:17:13] of his ways
[1:17:16] gideon had been taught a relative
[1:17:18] or relational truth
[1:17:21] not and it took contact with god himself
[1:17:24] to give him an absolute
[1:17:33] if you ever meet him it'll make you tear
[1:17:35] down every altar in your life that's not
[1:17:37] right
[1:17:39] it will it'll make you examine
[1:17:41] everything that you do
[1:17:43] and you know what it'll do it'll allow
[1:17:45] the two spirits
[1:17:47] you know what allow you to identify the
[1:17:49] two spirits working within your mind
[1:17:52] oh my i ain't worried about you i'm
[1:17:54] worried about me
[1:17:56] you know immediately what we do i was
[1:17:57] preaching in the church just some time
[1:17:59] back and i was preaching and under
[1:18:01] discernment i could hear certain names
[1:18:03] that was being popped up because people
[1:18:05] was applying i said stop what you're
[1:18:06] doing don't you do that i said i'm not
[1:18:09] preaching against men but i'm preaching
[1:18:11] against the spirit
[1:18:13] that's god and then defiled us
[1:18:21] listen moses had knowledge that he was a
[1:18:24] deliverer
[1:18:26] but when he tried it on his own it
[1:18:28] killed one egyptian
[1:18:30] but when he met the pillar of fire
[1:18:33] when he met the one that told his mama
[1:18:36] see it was second-handed religion for
[1:18:38] moses at one time moses you're a proper
[1:18:41] child god's called you deliver and he
[1:18:43] walks out with his chest stuck out and
[1:18:45] he kills one egyptian and then the
[1:18:47] people come back and said who are you
[1:18:49] are you going to tell us what to do you
[1:18:51] who can and he said he knew that he was
[1:18:54] discovered
[1:18:55] listen but one one thirty second span of
[1:18:58] time
[1:18:59] in the presence of god changed that man
[1:19:03] that's what produced the deliverer and
[1:19:05] if the bride of jesus christ ever gets
[1:19:08] produced it's going to be not because
[1:19:10] she's laying in the revel in the
[1:19:12] presence of some man's revelation but
[1:19:15] it's because she's going to be laying in
[1:19:17] the presence of the soe and the spirit
[1:19:19] of god
[1:19:21] [Music]
[1:19:23] malachi 4 5 and 6 there's three parts to
[1:19:26] it
[1:19:27] i the lord
[1:19:29] will send unto you elijah the prophet
[1:19:39] we've been able to identify the lord
[1:19:42] we've able to identify the elijah
[1:19:45] but you got to identify
[1:19:48] the you
[1:19:49] [Music]
[1:19:52] you have to identify the you
[1:19:55] you have to allow the spirit of god to
[1:19:57] put you in that scripture verse
[1:20:02] if not it's relational truth
[1:20:05] it's relative truth and when somebody
[1:20:07] can come along they'll they'll convince
[1:20:09] you and change you right out of it
[1:20:12] are you with me now
[1:20:14] oh my
[1:20:16] what about paul man
[1:20:18] well you talking about somebody
[1:20:20] intelligent
[1:20:21] you're talking about somebody that knew
[1:20:22] moses's message
[1:20:25] that could quote it from front to back
[1:20:26] that would tie everybody up in knots and
[1:20:30] oh wow we can't compete with that
[1:20:32] what are we going to do with that
[1:20:35] and then paul
[1:20:36] when he met the pillar of fire
[1:20:39] he said for i was alive without the law
[1:20:42] once
[1:20:43] he said but when the commandment came
[1:20:45] sin revived and i died
[1:20:48] and the commandment which was ordained
[1:20:50] to life he said i found it to be unto
[1:20:53] what death
[1:20:55] oh my it wasn't what he thought it was
[1:20:58] when the revelation come and that's the
[1:21:00] way it is with every son with every
[1:21:02] daughter of god a lot of times when it
[1:21:04] comes it come and it wasn't what we
[1:21:06] thought it was
[1:21:09] we thought the table has been full for
[1:21:12] years
[1:21:15] well i believe the message and i believe
[1:21:17] this doctrine and this camp was
[1:21:19] grazed up and this camp was raised up
[1:21:21] and this camp was right up well i'm the
[1:21:23] one that's got the balance you've got to
[1:21:25] hear what i've got to say
[1:21:28] you know what brother branham said
[1:21:30] that's the reason the church with god
[1:21:32] spewed her out she would no longer be
[1:21:33] the
[1:21:34] mouthpiece of god
[1:21:36] why because her own ideas was being
[1:21:38] given utterance it wasn't allowing god
[1:21:41] himself to utter the truth that's the
[1:21:43] reason brother branham said she'll be
[1:21:45] the final voice to the final age under
[1:21:48] her prophet messenger
[1:21:50] [Music]
[1:21:51] let me ask you a question
[1:21:53] what are you following tonight
[1:21:56] are you following brother branham
[1:21:59] come on now
[1:22:00] [Music]
[1:22:03] was elisha following elijah
[1:22:06] it looked like he was in the beginning
[1:22:07] he poured hands on elijah right he heard
[1:22:10] every word that he said
[1:22:12] but there come a point in time
[1:22:14] when he said i want what you have
[1:22:18] are you with me if you don't ever hunger
[1:22:20] and thirst after what the prophet had
[1:22:23] what you've got is dead intellect
[1:22:28] are you with me now
[1:22:29] elijah said you've asked a hard thing
[1:22:32] he said but if you see me when i go he
[1:22:35] said you can have the double portion
[1:22:39] listen there was all kinds of other
[1:22:40] voices that come out brother kelly and
[1:22:42] they begin to try to sidetrack him hey
[1:22:44] don't you know this about the messenger
[1:22:46] don't you know your messenger is going
[1:22:48] up today listen god takes the scriptures
[1:22:51] and identifies today in the hour and
[1:22:53] we're living in why because it's the two
[1:22:55] spirits still living today and just as
[1:22:58] sure as the enemies working amongst us
[1:23:01] don't worry the spirit of god is one
[1:23:03] step ahead of the enemy why because he
[1:23:05] is the master chess player he's already
[1:23:07] got the devil checkmated
[1:23:10] don't you know that your master's going
[1:23:12] up don't you know this about the prophet
[1:23:15] don't you know this he said i know be
[1:23:17] still and be quiet
[1:23:19] he was no longer following a man
[1:23:22] but he was following the word that comes
[1:23:24] straight out of a prophet's mouth
[1:23:26] are you hearing me
[1:23:34] when he got over there
[1:23:36] watch what he had to do
[1:23:42] he had to take off his own intellect now
[1:23:50] picked up the same spirit that was on
[1:23:52] the prophet
[1:23:54] in other words he had to die to what he
[1:23:56] thought was right he had to die what he
[1:23:59] thought somebody else was right he had
[1:24:01] to die to proper theology he couldn't
[1:24:04] listen to any other voice why he was not
[1:24:07] listening to the voice of the man but
[1:24:09] the spirit of god spoke to him through a
[1:24:11] man and he said i'm going all the way he
[1:24:14] watched when elijah went up
[1:24:16] when the mantle fell down he walked over
[1:24:18] like this and he picked up the man on
[1:24:21] notice he never said where is elijah but
[1:24:24] he said where is the god of elijah
[1:24:28] see he had the revelation of what it's
[1:24:31] about and the bible says that he smoked
[1:24:34] the jordan and the same god that was
[1:24:36] with elijah was the same god that was
[1:24:39] with that prophet now and the bible said
[1:24:42] that the jordan opened
[1:24:46] oh my when he come across jordan
[1:24:49] those same ones that was looking at a
[1:24:51] man says where is elijah they said
[1:24:54] pre-adventure god left him on a mountain
[1:24:56] somewhere said let us go find him he
[1:24:58] said don't go but they wouldn't listen
[1:25:01] to the word of the hour they had to go
[1:25:03] find their own way they had to go look
[1:25:06] for their own idea
[1:25:08] and watch this he was waiting on them
[1:25:10] when they come back across
[1:25:12] he said did i not tell you not to go
[1:25:15] they could not recognize that god had
[1:25:18] transitioned his spirit
[1:25:20] just like they could not recognize when
[1:25:22] it was in the temple
[1:25:25] and the holiest of holies moved to a
[1:25:27] place built by hands to a tabernacle
[1:25:30] that was not built by hands it was by
[1:25:33] virgin birth they could not recognize it
[1:25:37] hallelujah
[1:25:39] oh my
[1:25:41] i am not following a man i hear the
[1:25:43] voice of a man when i press play but i
[1:25:46] am fully following the words of god
[1:25:49] almighty himself and it's taken me all
[1:25:52] the way to the end
[1:25:56] are you with me
[1:25:58] [Applause]
[1:26:01] oh hallelujah
[1:26:04] let me just
[1:26:05] let me touch on this and i want to skip
[1:26:07] down this
[1:26:09] do you realize
[1:26:11] that when the people wanted a king
[1:26:14] it was not according to the word of god
[1:26:17] god gave him a prophet
[1:26:19] god gave him his word to live by but
[1:26:21] they said no we are the one that wants a
[1:26:24] king
[1:26:31] we still got the spirit of kings that
[1:26:33] tries to set himself up
[1:26:35] in the message
[1:26:37] oh come on now
[1:26:40] listen you know what i'm finding when
[1:26:42] things like this are preached i look at
[1:26:44] people and i watch them go
[1:26:45] finally
[1:26:46] somebody had enough courage to say it
[1:26:50] oh there's problems in the message but
[1:26:52] it ain't been the message and it ain't
[1:26:54] been the prophet it's been what men has
[1:26:57] interjected into it to make it
[1:27:01] and you know whose fault it is it's been
[1:27:02] the ministry's fault
[1:27:05] and it's been the laity's fault for not
[1:27:08] holding men accountable to the truth
[1:27:12] the bible says in the i don't know if it
[1:27:14] was the ephesians or the galatians i
[1:27:16] believe it was or
[1:27:17] maybe if thessalonica but they searched
[1:27:19] the scriptures daily and they found them
[1:27:22] to be liars why because they had the
[1:27:24] same spirit of god revealing the truth
[1:27:27] to them telling them what was true
[1:27:36] when they chose saul
[1:27:39] now i want you i'm not gonna you can go
[1:27:41] home and read first and second samuel
[1:27:42] i've been first in second samuel now for
[1:27:44] two months preaching out of it i just
[1:27:46] can't i ask god i god said let me see
[1:27:48] what's going on today and i don't want
[1:27:49] just to quote lord i said but i want you
[1:27:51] to show me where it's at in the bible
[1:27:54] show it to me in the bible i want to see
[1:27:57] it for myself right here i don't have
[1:27:59] any problem taking brother graham's word
[1:28:01] but i want to see it according to this
[1:28:04] are you with me
[1:28:08] and so what you see with saul
[1:28:12] he had a connection to jehovah
[1:28:15] but he did not have a relationship with
[1:28:17] jehovah
[1:28:19] his connection to jehovah was through a
[1:28:22] prophet
[1:28:25] he did not have an absolute truth but it
[1:28:28] had a relative or a relational truth
[1:28:32] because when the words come to him
[1:28:34] through a prophet
[1:28:36] and said kill all all the amalekites
[1:28:39] because it was relational and not
[1:28:42] absolute then he began to change the
[1:28:46] word and then when god sent the prophet
[1:28:49] back and said what is this noise that i
[1:28:52] hear in my ears he said i have done all
[1:28:54] that he argued with god's prophet why
[1:28:58] because it was not absolute it was
[1:29:01] relative truth
[1:29:06] [Music]
[1:29:08] and then he blames the people
[1:29:10] [Music]
[1:29:13] that's in the bible go read it for
[1:29:15] yourself
[1:29:17] well the people kept back what they
[1:29:19] thought was best for you
[1:29:21] god wasn't holding the people
[1:29:22] accountable he said so i told you to do
[1:29:26] this you were the leader of them and you
[1:29:28] didn't do it
[1:29:36] you know how he pulled the people into
[1:29:38] himself
[1:29:43] amen
[1:29:44] here you can do it better than me
[1:29:50] he cut a sacrifice up and he said all
[1:29:53] that don't follow
[1:29:55] saul and samuel let them be like this
[1:29:58] beast he put fear upon the people and he
[1:30:01] drew the now watch that tactic is only
[1:30:03] going to last so long because now when
[1:30:07] the enemy come in like a flood
[1:30:09] when the philistines god allowed it that
[1:30:11] way when the philistines come up against
[1:30:13] him now he's afraid and the people have
[1:30:16] scattered from him
[1:30:17] and now what he does he goes and takes
[1:30:20] the place of a prophet are you with me
[1:30:23] and he goes out and offers a sacrifice
[1:30:25] and samuel comes to him because samuel
[1:30:28] didn't come when he wanted him to are
[1:30:31] you with me now he didn't come when he
[1:30:33] wanted him to but when he showed up he
[1:30:35] said because he was delayed i went watch
[1:30:38] what he said i forced
[1:30:42] jesus
[1:30:43] he forced something he should not have
[1:30:46] done
[1:30:48] he should have left it alone and waited
[1:30:50] on god to do the job
[1:30:59] he had a relative or a relational truth
[1:31:02] but it was through a prophet but now
[1:31:05] david on the other hand
[1:31:08] are you with me
[1:31:10] before
[1:31:11] god ever sent samuel to anoint him he
[1:31:14] already had a relationship
[1:31:17] on the back side of the desert
[1:31:20] now if you notice when the people chose
[1:31:22] they chose saul
[1:31:24] god gave them their choice and he
[1:31:26] anointed that man with a vile or a
[1:31:29] judgment of oil
[1:31:32] but when it comes to david
[1:31:34] the bible says he anointed him with a
[1:31:36] horn which represents the power
[1:31:40] and when the enemy come in god sent his
[1:31:43] choice in the battle he listen oh my
[1:31:46] listen saul tried to put his relative or
[1:31:49] relational truth upon god's servant and
[1:31:52] the bible says he has saved or attempted
[1:31:55] to go and he started off with that
[1:31:57] doctrine and he said i don't think this
[1:31:59] will fit
[1:32:00] he said because i have not tested it
[1:32:03] because i have not tried it he said i
[1:32:05] will tell you what i have tried i was on
[1:32:07] the backside of a desert and one of a
[1:32:10] lion and a bear coming after my father's
[1:32:13] sheep and he delivered him into my hands
[1:32:21] he still had the words of a prophet
[1:32:24] but he had a relationship with jehovah
[1:32:27] himself
[1:32:29] and that was the difference
[1:32:34] oh my
[1:32:35] god
[1:32:37] you say oh that's for the preachers oh
[1:32:39] no
[1:32:40] that's for everybody
[1:32:45] that is for everybody
[1:32:47] but you know what saul wasn't lost
[1:32:57] [Music]
[1:32:59] you realize that when
[1:33:03] you know why he had a connection to god
[1:33:05] through a prophet but not god himself
[1:33:06] because when god removed the prophet out
[1:33:08] of his life
[1:33:10] he could not get a hold of god
[1:33:13] are you with me
[1:33:15] and the bible says he went and consulted
[1:33:17] a witch
[1:33:19] oh guess what god did to him
[1:33:22] who do you see oh i see god he said oh
[1:33:24] that's
[1:33:24] that's samuel
[1:33:26] do you realize when the prophet came
[1:33:28] back to him he couldn't tell him
[1:33:30] anything different than what he already
[1:33:32] told him
[1:33:33] he said why are you disturbing me seeing
[1:33:35] that you are an enemy of god you didn't
[1:33:38] kill it when you had a chance
[1:33:41] listen if brother branham would come
[1:33:43] back today he couldn't say any more than
[1:33:45] what he's already said
[1:33:47] because you know why
[1:33:49] if we ain't going to listen to him now
[1:33:51] we wouldn't listen to him if he was
[1:33:52] standing in the flesh
[1:33:56] [Applause]
[1:33:58] you say well where's that at brother
[1:33:59] branham said you say oh if jesus was
[1:34:02] where he said no your attitude now would
[1:34:04] determine what it was if he was standing
[1:34:06] in the flesh then
[1:34:08] are you with me now
[1:34:13] i ain't mad at nobody but the devil i
[1:34:15] love everybody but listen i'm if god
[1:34:18] allows me not within myself but as the
[1:34:20] revelation comes i god has raised you
[1:34:23] and i both up you may not be a preacher
[1:34:26] but god has raised you up to tear the
[1:34:28] devil's kingdom down are you with me
[1:34:33] oh my
[1:34:35] he ate with the prophet he communed with
[1:34:37] the prophet he talked with the prophet
[1:34:39] he had all these things but when it come
[1:34:40] down to the acid test
[1:34:43] there was no revelation
[1:34:46] oh my god
[1:34:50] let me just skip on down it's a
[1:34:53] getting late and i need to uh
[1:34:55] i need to bring this
[1:34:59] brother man says now i admit that people
[1:35:01] study too much
[1:35:03] and go too far ahead and try to think
[1:35:05] too hard and sometimes have mental
[1:35:07] breakdowns on the count of studying
[1:35:09] about the lord
[1:35:12] he says you must quit that
[1:35:15] he said you don't have to do that
[1:35:18] he said the only thing you have to do is
[1:35:20] fall in love with him and just go right
[1:35:24] on loving him
[1:35:33] i think many people have been in love
[1:35:34] with the prophet
[1:35:37] i love the prophet
[1:35:40] if he was here you know what i'll be
[1:35:41] doing i got questions i want answered
[1:35:44] i'd be on the list to get an interview i
[1:35:46] ain't lying to you
[1:35:48] i told the church i said don't worry i
[1:35:50] ain't leaving the message and i ain't
[1:35:51] leaving what he said but i'm leaving
[1:35:53] every man-made idea of it behind
[1:35:55] are you with me because as i hear the
[1:35:57] voice that voice is bringing instruction
[1:35:59] and it's telling me what to do it's
[1:36:01] telling me how how how i need to live my
[1:36:03] life and how we need to get prepared for
[1:36:06] a rapture how what we need to do to get
[1:36:08] prepared brother branham says when she
[1:36:10] and the invisible union of the bride of
[1:36:11] christ he said when she goes to dropping
[1:36:14] herself
[1:36:15] back in line with the word he said watch
[1:36:17] the scriptures then he said there will
[1:36:19] be a message that will sweep out and
[1:36:21] catch her he said when she begins to
[1:36:23] have a revival oh i like that one
[1:36:26] because it chokes the days the revival's
[1:36:28] over with i told the church i said if
[1:36:30] you think revival's over that's because
[1:36:32] you're dead already because listen we're
[1:36:35] the spirit of god there's liberty
[1:36:39] you know what we need we need some more
[1:36:42] old-fashioned pentecostal experiences
[1:36:45] again and brother branham said you can
[1:36:47] learn this message that we're trying to
[1:36:50] teach are you with me now we can be
[1:36:52] educated into it but when you say the
[1:36:54] word pentecost people seize up like you
[1:36:56] stuck a whole lemon in their mouth
[1:36:58] because they don't understand what it is
[1:37:01] without pithy because you can't even see
[1:37:03] the message of the hour
[1:37:07] you know why people don't want gifts in
[1:37:09] the church
[1:37:11] because they don't want the sin being
[1:37:13] called out
[1:37:15] brother listen people says brother
[1:37:16] branham god said god brother said
[1:37:18] brother they say brother branham said
[1:37:20] that god put the gifts on the shelf he
[1:37:21] never said that i did a study on it he
[1:37:24] never said that he said i'm longing for
[1:37:26] a day when the love of god can come into
[1:37:28] the church and it just takes care of the
[1:37:30] problem but he said those five
[1:37:32] ministering gifts the fivefold ministry
[1:37:34] and the nine spiritual gifts was put
[1:37:37] into the church to keep it clean until
[1:37:39] the coming of the lord
[1:37:41] [Music]
[1:37:46] somebody says and i'm spiritual gifts
[1:37:48] ain't here i say i'm sorry you're lying
[1:37:50] you know why and i don't say this i
[1:37:52] don't know why god has let me experience
[1:37:53] it but i have experienced
[1:37:55] every single one of them
[1:37:58] not trying to but at different points in
[1:38:00] my life in the last 15 years it's
[1:38:02] happened
[1:38:03] without asking so now that's like you
[1:38:06] telling me
[1:38:07] there ain't no such thing as chicken and
[1:38:09] you ain't never ate it
[1:38:10] but i have
[1:38:13] the word is primary
[1:38:15] but when people will not hear the word
[1:38:18] take take another gift
[1:38:21] well brother branham put him on the
[1:38:23] shelf after the word come
[1:38:24] no he didn't no he didn't
[1:38:26] men put him on the shelf men stuck him
[1:38:29] in the corner somewhere
[1:38:34] oh wow
[1:38:36] i told brother stephen in a study i said
[1:38:37] i have had to have a spiritual detox in
[1:38:40] the last five years
[1:38:42] because god has begun to change what i
[1:38:45] thought i knew
[1:38:47] and if you ain't willing to lay down
[1:38:49] everything that you know and start all
[1:38:51] over again
[1:38:53] i just wonder
[1:38:57] amen it's not trying to push into
[1:38:59] something or make yourself something
[1:39:01] that you're not
[1:39:02] just go ahead and let god push you in
[1:39:04] the way he wants to just yield yourself
[1:39:07] commit yourself and walk on happy
[1:39:10] singing and rejoicing he said the bible
[1:39:12] said that all things work together for
[1:39:14] the good of them that love him so just
[1:39:17] be sure that you love him he says and
[1:39:19] that's the only thing you have to old
[1:39:21] brother tim i got to know is about the
[1:39:23] seals no you don't you just got to know
[1:39:25] him and you just got to be in love with
[1:39:27] him that's the only thing that matters
[1:39:30] because he will teach you what you see
[1:39:32] we we majored for 20 30 40 50 years on
[1:39:36] what we did know or what we didn't know
[1:39:38] but i'm coming to find out what i
[1:39:40] thought a lot of people know they didn't
[1:39:41] really know in the first place are you
[1:39:43] with me they may have had good knowledge
[1:39:45] paul said though i understand all
[1:39:47] mysteries though i can quote it
[1:39:49] frontwards and backwards but i do not
[1:39:50] have the love of god he said it is
[1:39:53] because you know what somewhere when
[1:39:54] that voice stops sounding then that
[1:39:56] doctrine is going to stop sounding but
[1:39:58] if it was ever the spirit of god it'll
[1:40:00] live on in the hearts of a son and a
[1:40:02] daughter of god
[1:40:04] see when it's relational or relative you
[1:40:07] can change it to fit your feelings and
[1:40:09] can fit your ideas
[1:40:12] oh my let me give you one more place and
[1:40:14] a quote and i'll
[1:40:16] i'll go on i want to touch on this
[1:40:21] oh i got too much
[1:40:25] let me just roll down here
[1:40:29] i want you to think about this absalom
[1:40:31] for just a moment here
[1:40:33] when absalom
[1:40:37] he thought he could do a better job than
[1:40:39] david
[1:40:41] and he probably had some better ideas
[1:40:44] he probably had better ways to rule the
[1:40:46] kingdom than david did
[1:40:48] but the problem was he hadn't been
[1:40:50] chosen
[1:40:54] i said he hadn't been chosen to be a
[1:40:56] king
[1:40:57] and the bible said he had no seat after
[1:40:59] him but in the king's dell he reared up
[1:41:01] his own pillar or his own message or his
[1:41:04] own doctrine in his own idea and do you
[1:41:07] know god let that go along for a while
[1:41:10] because you know what he was doing when
[1:41:12] that happened he was revealing who had
[1:41:14] it and who didn't he revealed who was
[1:41:16] going after the real king
[1:41:21] i told the church i said don't thank you
[1:41:23] just because you believe god sent a
[1:41:24] prophet that you're going to sit at the
[1:41:25] wedding supper
[1:41:27] uh not going to happen i said the devil
[1:41:29] believes the same things in tremble
[1:41:31] don't tell me don't if he believes that
[1:41:33] there's one god then he triples don't
[1:41:34] tell me he don't believe the seventh
[1:41:36] seal is open don't tell me he don't
[1:41:37] believe that god sent a prophet don't
[1:41:38] tell me he don't believe all the
[1:41:40] scriptures he just can't make it work
[1:41:43] but he believes it all why do you think
[1:41:45] he's trying to discredit it
[1:41:48] that's why he wants to discredit because
[1:41:51] if he can discredit it takes the power
[1:41:53] right out of you
[1:41:55] you want you want this brother branham
[1:41:56] said it like this he said if those
[1:41:58] egyptians could ever got the rod out of
[1:42:01] the hand of moses he said they'd have
[1:42:02] them whip he said and if he could ever
[1:42:04] get the deity out of the name of jesus
[1:42:07] christ he said he'll have the church
[1:42:08] whip don't tell me he won't try to
[1:42:10] discredit the word
[1:42:12] and if he can't make you disbelieve it
[1:42:14] he'll make you run over
[1:42:16] too far
[1:42:18] to the other side where you believe what
[1:42:19] i believe
[1:42:21] i got the truth and you don't have it
[1:42:24] i'm done with that nonsense
[1:42:26] i ain't afraid to say i don't know a
[1:42:28] whole lot but i know him and what i do
[1:42:30] know these revealed to me i know it and
[1:42:31] you can't take it from me
[1:42:36] but now catch this
[1:42:42] let me just phrase it without reading
[1:42:43] the scriptures for the sake of time
[1:42:48] but when joe had killed absalom okay
[1:42:53] there were
[1:42:54] two men
[1:42:56] if i could say it this way there were
[1:42:57] two messengers
[1:42:59] right
[1:43:01] one was named kushai and the other one
[1:43:03] was named a high mass
[1:43:06] now
[1:43:08] joab says
[1:43:09] cush i i want you to come i want you to
[1:43:11] take a message to the king
[1:43:14] a high mass when he come up he said can
[1:43:16] i take it
[1:43:18] he said you're not running with good
[1:43:19] tidings today
[1:43:22] are you with me now maybe you've heard
[1:43:24] this before but i've seen this and i got
[1:43:25] kind of excited
[1:43:27] and and so
[1:43:28] he says
[1:43:30] he says kusha i want you to take the
[1:43:32] message i want you to take this message
[1:43:33] to the king now notice he wasn't taking
[1:43:36] the message to the people and he wasn't
[1:43:38] taking the message
[1:43:40] to another preacher
[1:43:42] he was taking the message back
[1:43:45] to the king
[1:43:47] listen to me now
[1:43:50] and so
[1:43:51] kush i
[1:43:52] or a high mass
[1:43:54] he hears
[1:43:55] the exact same words
[1:43:59] that joab spoke to kushai
[1:44:02] he heard he was in the presence and
[1:44:04] physically he heard the same exact words
[1:44:08] that joab gave to cushi
[1:44:11] and so cushion you know he's not the
[1:44:12] swiftest runner he's not the fast but
[1:44:14] he's just plodding along and uh-hum ass
[1:44:17] he's he's got full of zeal he's all
[1:44:18] excited he said joab can can i run he
[1:44:21] said why do you want to run saying you
[1:44:22] don't have a message
[1:44:27] but i'm here i'm fighting he said let me
[1:44:29] take the message and he said well run
[1:44:32] you're not going to listen so run on
[1:44:34] anyway
[1:44:36] and because he was so full of zeal he
[1:44:38] overran cushi
[1:44:41] and the watchman was standing in the
[1:44:43] gate and all of a sudden david is
[1:44:45] standing there in the water david was
[1:44:47] standing at the gate and a watchman
[1:44:48] tells david he said look i see a runner
[1:44:51] and he said me think it's it's the
[1:44:53] running of a high mass david said he's a
[1:44:56] good man with good tidings in other
[1:44:58] words he's going to bring me a good
[1:45:00] message oh my now listen to me now
[1:45:04] and when he gets there he falls down
[1:45:07] oh long live the king that's that's
[1:45:10] i'm just going to say in my own language
[1:45:12] destroyed all your enemies and i can see
[1:45:14] david saying
[1:45:15] yeah
[1:45:16] i know that
[1:45:18] he killed the bear he killed the lion he
[1:45:20] killed goliath he told me that he would
[1:45:23] make my enemies my footstool he's just
[1:45:25] listening
[1:45:26] but he was wanting something very
[1:45:29] specific
[1:45:33] very specific
[1:45:37] do you have the revelation a high mass
[1:45:40] that i am looking for
[1:45:42] that's the reason the bible says study
[1:45:44] to show thyself approve a workman not
[1:45:46] unto man but unto god
[1:45:49] he was looking for a very specific
[1:45:51] revelation and now
[1:45:54] as he's coming in
[1:45:56] the watchman says oh i see another
[1:45:57] runner
[1:45:58] he says it looks like cushion he said oh
[1:46:01] he's another good man with tidings
[1:46:04] and he comes running in and if you'll go
[1:46:06] back and look their salutations are real
[1:46:09] similar
[1:46:11] go look at it go look at it they're real
[1:46:13] similar
[1:46:16] all he had to do was repeat what he
[1:46:19] heard joab say
[1:46:22] but when david said what am i looking
[1:46:24] for he said i don't know
[1:46:26] he said i heard a great comet
[1:46:29] i heard a great noise
[1:46:31] i heard a voice
[1:46:33] i heard a shout but i don't know what it
[1:46:36] means
[1:46:44] watch
[1:46:46] david just looked at him
[1:46:48] and he said
[1:46:50] stand aside
[1:46:54] and now he's standing and waiting for
[1:46:56] kasha to come
[1:46:57] and kushai comes in and he gives a
[1:46:59] similar greeting
[1:47:01] and he says
[1:47:03] what about absalom
[1:47:06] see he actually heard
[1:47:09] the message
[1:47:13] he actually got the interpretation
[1:47:24] he said is absalom
[1:47:27] he said let all of thy enemies
[1:47:29] which is what a high mass said
[1:47:31] god's killed you and he said let all of
[1:47:33] thy enemies be as this young
[1:47:36] man
[1:47:39] one was running with a message
[1:47:42] and the other one was running with out
[1:47:45] a message
[1:47:46] one had relative truth
[1:47:49] and the other one had
[1:47:51] absolute
[1:47:52] truth
[1:47:54] let me read you a quote
[1:47:57] before i leave here
[1:48:01] both ministry and laity
[1:48:04] must
[1:48:05] make sure that we're running
[1:48:07] with a message
[1:48:12] it does not matter what i believe
[1:48:15] if time tarries and i get an old man and
[1:48:18] i come down to where
[1:48:24] i have excelled my last earthly breath
[1:48:27] it is not going to matter what i believe
[1:48:30] about the message when i cross the river
[1:48:34] what's going to matter is do i know him
[1:48:38] in the power of it do you realize up
[1:48:40] until job got in the condition that he
[1:48:43] was in you wonder why you go bad through
[1:48:46] bad things well you wonder why we fall
[1:48:48] down and mess up and seem like we can't
[1:48:50] ever get up you we wonder these things
[1:48:52] you know why because many times up until
[1:48:55] that point we just have a relational
[1:48:57] truth we just have relative truth see
[1:48:59] job did all the right things he offered
[1:49:01] the sacrifices to burn offering in case
[1:49:03] my kids did this he had all the basics
[1:49:06] covered but there was something that was
[1:49:09] missing and god had to take him down to
[1:49:12] the valley of the shadow of death and
[1:49:14] then when he brought him down then he
[1:49:16] brought him an absolute and he could
[1:49:19] stand now and he answered his own
[1:49:21] question at that point he didn't need a
[1:49:23] lahu to answer it elihu he didn't need
[1:49:26] his friends to answer and because god
[1:49:28] himself came down and he answered his
[1:49:31] question and then he could stand apart
[1:49:34] from any human advice and he could say i
[1:49:37] know that my redeemer liveth and though
[1:49:39] the skin worms devour this body
[1:49:42] with these eyes
[1:49:46] what eyes the eyes it was going to rot
[1:49:47] in the ground he said with these eyes i
[1:49:50] shall see him why he already see him in
[1:49:53] a spirit realm
[1:49:55] he said there'll be two in the field
[1:49:57] and i'll take one and i'll leave one
[1:50:00] there'll be two in the same message the
[1:50:03] same bed of doctrine he said but i'll
[1:50:05] take one and i'll leave one why
[1:50:08] because they've been predestinated
[1:50:11] they've been for dane before the
[1:50:13] foundation of the world to say
[1:50:15] amen to every word of god
[1:50:19] hallelujah
[1:50:21] [Applause]
[1:50:29] well
[1:50:31] i see
[1:50:32] the shingle i like the pictures you got
[1:50:34] in the church
[1:50:36] because that's the way i've got it in
[1:50:37] mine
[1:50:38] well where's the picture i told the
[1:50:40] church i said listen
[1:50:41] i got the picture in my office
[1:50:43] i believe the picture
[1:50:45] but you know what you can have the
[1:50:46] pictures up and still not believe it
[1:50:51] you have the picture of them still not
[1:50:53] believe it
[1:51:02] we're doing some decorating in my church
[1:51:04] i got a picture of the hoffman head of
[1:51:05] christ there
[1:51:07] and i got one over here
[1:51:08] of christ in the midst of the seven
[1:51:10] golden candlesticks
[1:51:12] because it's christ in every single one
[1:51:15] of us
[1:51:16] jesus was the first angel heavenly and
[1:51:19] he was the seventh angel heavenly
[1:51:22] and as he sounded his message through
[1:51:24] each age that earthly portion on the
[1:51:27] earth picked the message up and sounded
[1:51:29] it
[1:51:30] and then the ministry under paul timothy
[1:51:32] and all of them sounded the exact same
[1:51:35] message are you with me and then the
[1:51:38] laity caught the revelation and picked
[1:51:40] it up christ in them and they lived it
[1:51:42] why it wasn't one over the other god
[1:51:46] called me into offices but it was christ
[1:51:48] in all of them
[1:51:50] are you with me the hope of glory
[1:51:54] brother branham said what jeffersonville
[1:51:55] needs he says it's thousands of lived
[1:51:58] lives he said that's the thunder that
[1:52:01] shakes the devil
[1:52:03] my belief does not shake the devil but
[1:52:06] when the word takes on flesh again
[1:52:10] [Applause]
[1:52:13] [Music]
[1:52:25] oh i like it
[1:52:27] the seven sons of skeva
[1:52:30] well
[1:52:33] paul preached this message it'll work
[1:52:34] for me
[1:52:36] i didn't work for paul because paul had
[1:52:37] to get a revelation of it first
[1:52:40] are you with me now
[1:52:42] he commanded the seven devils to come
[1:52:44] out of that individual
[1:52:46] and he said
[1:52:47] the the the message that paul's preaches
[1:52:49] the jesus that paul's preaches i command
[1:52:52] you to do it and that devil turned and
[1:52:53] said paul i know
[1:52:56] and jesus i know and brother branham i
[1:52:59] know but who are you
[1:53:02] you think because we believe something
[1:53:04] it backs the devil up uh uh
[1:53:07] no no no it didn't back him up it didn't
[1:53:10] back them up that the disciples walked
[1:53:11] with jesus but what backed him up was
[1:53:14] when peter
[1:53:15] are you with me and john come walking
[1:53:17] down to the gate beautiful because now
[1:53:19] what they'd heard was finally in them
[1:53:21] now in other words they just didn't
[1:53:23] wasn't in the message but the message
[1:53:25] came on the inside of them and when they
[1:53:28] come down to the gate beautiful he
[1:53:30] looked down now remember the same man
[1:53:32] that run like a scared animal a scared
[1:53:34] rabbit and cursed and denied the lord
[1:53:36] jesus three times now can walking down
[1:53:39] in boldness and he said man listen let
[1:53:41] me tell you something i don't got no
[1:53:43] money silver and gold have i none but
[1:53:46] not such as brother branham's god but
[1:53:49] not such as jesus god he said but such
[1:53:52] as i have give out thee he said rise up
[1:53:55] and walk in the name of jesus christ
[1:53:57] that's what backed the devil up because
[1:53:59] the revelation took on flesh
[1:54:02] [Applause]
[1:54:08] hallelujah
[1:54:10] i said the revelation of the word
[1:54:12] finally took on flesh
[1:54:14] somewhere along the line it's got to
[1:54:15] move from the prophet to the prophecy
[1:54:17] that was spoken
[1:54:20] one of the most overlooked scriptures in
[1:54:23] the message to me now that's just my
[1:54:25] personal opinion you can take it or
[1:54:27] leave it like it or lump it it don't
[1:54:28] matter to me but one of the most
[1:54:30] overlooked scriptures that was described
[1:54:33] the prophet's ministry was genesis 24
[1:54:36] he did not come to reveal himself the
[1:54:38] scripture revealed who he was but he
[1:54:40] come to reveal and pick up a bride for
[1:54:43] his maker
[1:54:45] [Applause]
[1:54:49] oh you can find the message in that
[1:54:51] someone after the gifts
[1:54:54] she had some damsels that went out with
[1:54:56] her
[1:54:59] some of them been writing the word
[1:55:00] instead of listening to the word and
[1:55:03] causing them to fall in love with isaac
[1:55:05] they've been falling in love with
[1:55:07] eliezer
[1:55:08] and the whole time he's been trying to
[1:55:10] tell them who their mate really is
[1:55:13] [Music]
[1:55:19] you say that's no that's not taking him
[1:55:21] out of his position
[1:55:23] [Music]
[1:55:24] jesus said there was not a greater
[1:55:26] prophet than john the baptist
[1:55:29] but then that great prophet turns and
[1:55:31] says i must decrease
[1:55:34] so that he
[1:55:36] the person himself can increase
[1:55:39] look this message is a person
[1:55:42] this message is a person
[1:55:45] this message is not ideology and
[1:55:48] theology and doctrine and teaching
[1:55:51] that only tries to draw a picture to get
[1:55:53] you to see the person
[1:55:56] but it takes no man knows the things of
[1:55:58] god save the spirit of god
[1:56:01] the spirit of man knows the things of
[1:56:03] man but with the spirit of god this
[1:56:06] message reveals the person of jesus
[1:56:09] christ to you
[1:56:11] as the individual and joins you in an
[1:56:13] invisible union
[1:56:28] i'm trying to quit
[1:56:38] you realize what started in the first
[1:56:40] church age right
[1:56:42] still going on in the last church age
[1:56:46] you know what
[1:56:48] i hear preachers argue
[1:56:51] over things that brother brain said
[1:56:52] because it looks like there's
[1:56:53] discrepancies
[1:56:57] forgive me
[1:56:58] i don't lost too much weight my clothes
[1:56:59] is trying to fall off of me and i ain't
[1:57:01] bought more so for overlooked me from
[1:57:03] pulling up my pants
[1:57:05] but listen
[1:57:06] i hear brothers and
[1:57:08] there's some standing on this side over
[1:57:10] here and says well
[1:57:12] brother brandon said we're in the bright
[1:57:13] age
[1:57:14] well ain't no such thing as a bright age
[1:57:16] we're in the
[1:57:17] laodicean church age
[1:57:22] and they look at each other and they
[1:57:23] about hate each other over those
[1:57:25] what appears to be a conflict
[1:57:30] and i was thinking about that the one
[1:57:32] day and it was just like the lord come
[1:57:34] down and
[1:57:35] said when has there never not been a
[1:57:38] bright age
[1:57:50] see terminology can make you become a
[1:57:53] denomination
[1:57:55] brother branham said the difference
[1:57:57] between denomination and not being one
[1:58:00] he said it 25 to 27 times he said it's
[1:58:03] when you put a period at the end of it
[1:58:05] versus a comma
[1:58:07] i believe this this period or i believe
[1:58:09] this this comet if if there's going to
[1:58:11] be a period i'm going to let jesus
[1:58:12] christ put the period one one place i
[1:58:15] will put the period he's the same
[1:58:16] yesterday today and forever period into
[1:58:19] question
[1:58:21] but watch this now as paul preached his
[1:58:24] message
[1:58:25] the revelation went down to the elect
[1:58:29] and it caught him up that's the reason
[1:58:31] paul could write we are seated in christ
[1:58:34] jesus
[1:58:35] in heavenly ages he never used the
[1:58:37] terminology bright age but he said i
[1:58:40] want to present you a chaste virgin
[1:58:42] which is a bride
[1:58:44] back to christ so the revelation in
[1:58:47] paul's age caught them up above the
[1:58:49] spirit of the age and put them in a
[1:58:51] bright age
[1:58:54] and i can look and i say you're right
[1:58:56] and you're right and you're both wrong
[1:59:02] they're both quoting the same quotes
[1:59:07] but they're running without message
[1:59:11] if you cannot see
[1:59:15] if you cannot see people's rights all
[1:59:17] around you
[1:59:19] even in the churches people still
[1:59:21] fighting for my right
[1:59:24] if you cannot see gross darkness upon
[1:59:26] the people
[1:59:30] that's laodicea or laodicea trust still
[1:59:33] around us
[1:59:35] but when the revelation of the word
[1:59:37] picks you up
[1:59:39] laodicea is still going on but now
[1:59:42] you're like paul said
[1:59:44] you're seated in hallelujah you're
[1:59:47] seated in christ jesus in heavenly
[1:59:50] places
[1:59:51] no man gave it to you no man can take it
[1:59:54] away from you
[1:59:56] [Music]
[2:00:00] and i just went
[2:00:02] ah
[2:00:03] it's too simple
[2:00:07] both statements is right
[2:00:09] because you're looking at him and he's
[2:00:11] looking at you y'all looking at each
[2:00:13] other cross-siding because y'all
[2:00:14] carrying the spirit of denomination it's
[2:00:17] wrong
[2:00:23] you know that we're in little c you know
[2:00:25] that bride h that's what happened men
[2:00:27] take that and they'll be elevated so
[2:00:29] yeah brother i believe that you that
[2:00:30] brother over you know what he believes
[2:00:33] i told the church i said if you ain't
[2:00:35] never asked somebody really what they
[2:00:36] believe i said that's
[2:00:38] gossip if you wasn't a witness to it
[2:00:41] that's sulfuric acid in the church
[2:00:50] listen i don't know how to be me but me
[2:00:52] and get myself out of the way
[2:00:56] i told you i'm finding the actual
[2:00:58] message
[2:00:59] [Applause]
[2:01:03] because i've found when you read a quote
[2:01:06] i asked the preachers in my church i
[2:01:07] said let me ask you all a question
[2:01:09] i said when you read a quote
[2:01:11] i said are you putting brother branham
[2:01:13] before the people
[2:01:15] i said are you putting jesus christ
[2:01:16] before the people
[2:01:19] because if you put brother brandon
[2:01:21] before the people
[2:01:24] it'll produce a following or a movement
[2:01:27] but it will not produce life
[2:01:30] because he preached the word
[2:01:32] i said brothers if you preach that same
[2:01:35] quote
[2:01:36] it's no longer reading anymore but if
[2:01:38] you read it in the inspiration god lifts
[2:01:40] it off of the page
[2:01:43] because it was his word in the beginning
[2:01:46] he lifts it off the page and it will
[2:01:48] still reproduce do you know what i
[2:01:50] believe that many things that brother
[2:01:52] brandon preached from 63 to 65 wasn't
[2:01:54] even back then
[2:01:56] because we wasn't born yet
[2:01:59] if it was it had been over with
[2:02:02] mercy might be over with for some but it
[2:02:04] ain't over just yet
[2:02:07] listen i gotta quit let me read you this
[2:02:09] quote
[2:02:10] listen to this complaint of god
[2:02:12] revelations 2 14 nevertheless i have
[2:02:15] somewhat against thee because thou has
[2:02:16] left thy first love
[2:02:20] he said to understand this you must
[2:02:22] realize that the spirit is not speaking
[2:02:25] to the original saints of ephesus alone
[2:02:31] remember
[2:02:34] the first three horse riders
[2:02:36] was wrapped up in one
[2:02:39] which was the antichrist spirit writing
[2:02:41] all the way
[2:02:43] to the end
[2:02:44] whatever spirit was in the first church
[2:02:46] age carried over into the second church
[2:02:49] age to the third church age to the
[2:02:51] fourth to the fifth down to the seventh
[2:02:53] church age
[2:02:56] i am not in laodicea
[2:02:58] but my body feels the effect of laodicea
[2:03:02] my body still gets aggravated when
[2:03:04] somebody cuts me off interstate 85 or 40
[2:03:07] why because my mind is still trapped in
[2:03:10] laodicea my flesh is still trapped and
[2:03:12] you know what you shouldn't cut me off
[2:03:14] you know why because i think i have a
[2:03:16] right to be there
[2:03:25] i'm just honest
[2:03:29] hey i ain't afraid to tell myself listen
[2:03:31] you know i'll tell you this and just as
[2:03:33] a testimony and i'm gonna read this
[2:03:34] quote and i'm gonna get out of here
[2:03:36] but listen
[2:03:38] i
[2:03:39] i was listening or my wife was listening
[2:03:41] to a book
[2:03:43] by a nominal christian man and it was
[2:03:45] mark canton is his name it's a pretty
[2:03:47] good book if you want to read it listen
[2:03:48] to it you say oh it ain't the message
[2:03:50] but you know what i find
[2:03:52] the message is the truth there were
[2:03:54] certain things
[2:03:55] there was certain things that was
[2:03:57] revealed through the prophet but if you
[2:03:59] go back and look he tied up all the
[2:04:01] loose ends so whatever was truth before
[2:04:03] he could do nothing but repeat what
[2:04:05] always already laid out are you with me
[2:04:07] now okay before you know some people oh
[2:04:09] you listen to something listen if i
[2:04:11] listen to something else and it's a word
[2:04:12] of god and it changed me i'm okay with
[2:04:14] that
[2:04:15] but i was listening my wife said tim
[2:04:17] this is honey this is a good book you
[2:04:18] need to listen to it
[2:04:21] it's called unoffendable
[2:04:24] unoffendable
[2:04:26] and i was listening to it and i thought
[2:04:27] man this is scripture i'm gonna get me a
[2:04:28] sermon out of this one
[2:04:32] and i began to listen to it and the
[2:04:33] second time through it
[2:04:34] i said i don't listen this no more
[2:04:38] i don't want to listen to this anymore
[2:04:41] because god was telling me you're
[2:04:43] offended
[2:04:46] i thought me offended i don't hold
[2:04:48] nothing against nobody he said yes
[2:04:50] you're offended at your wife
[2:04:54] and she's offended at you
[2:04:58] and i went
[2:04:59] huh
[2:05:02] not me
[2:05:03] he said yes you are the man
[2:05:06] i told the brothers of the church i said
[2:05:08] when you out of order and your home's
[2:05:09] out of order i said you demand
[2:05:12] you demand you guilty
[2:05:15] and so
[2:05:19] i began to meditate on it three four
[2:05:20] days and i thought
[2:05:23] well lord
[2:05:24] i don't know what am i offended or what
[2:05:26] she offended at me
[2:05:30] and so we both were sick i don't know if
[2:05:32] we had whatever variant they call it
[2:05:36] who knows what's next but i think we had
[2:05:38] one of them you know
[2:05:40] and so
[2:05:41] at least it's what google
[2:05:43] describes as a symptom
[2:05:44] somebody tries to go to google to prove
[2:05:46] this message right or wrong that's the
[2:05:48] craziest thing i have ever seen
[2:05:50] wikipedia do you not realize that you
[2:05:52] yourself can edit wikipedia
[2:05:54] give me a break
[2:05:58] but anyway
[2:05:59] so
[2:06:00] i'm listening to this and
[2:06:03] and we're home and we're sick
[2:06:05] and i'm streaming and brother jason
[2:06:07] o'rourke is preaching at the church and
[2:06:08] fabulous message and
[2:06:11] and he says can we come can we me and
[2:06:13] brother ben the two deacons of church he
[2:06:14] said can we come by and pray for you
[2:06:16] after you and your wife after service i
[2:06:17] said well brother i said look we've been
[2:06:19] trying to stay home and shelter so we
[2:06:20] just don't if it is that we don't want
[2:06:22] to make anybody sick because we was
[2:06:23] feeling rough
[2:06:24] and um
[2:06:28] he insisted and after the third time he
[2:06:29] said i already think i've already been
[2:06:31] around i said well if you ain't afraid
[2:06:32] come on
[2:06:33] so he comes by and we sit down and
[2:06:36] he's sitting in a pew over here we got
[2:06:38] an old church pew my wife we've
[2:06:39] decorated and sit in the house and then
[2:06:41] brother brother was set in a rocker and
[2:06:43] i was sitting here and amy was sitting
[2:06:44] there and we were looking at each other
[2:06:46] and
[2:06:47] and they began to talk the spirit of god
[2:06:49] came into
[2:06:50] my living room
[2:06:53] and
[2:06:55] we took each other by the hand as they
[2:06:57] got up and they put hands on us and they
[2:06:59] was praying for us as you know husband
[2:07:01] and wife and pastor in the leadership of
[2:07:03] the church and asking god to touch her
[2:07:05] body
[2:07:06] and i began to pray from my wife in a
[2:07:08] way that i had never done it
[2:07:13] and when i did
[2:07:15] and the prayer was through i looked up
[2:07:18] and she looked at me
[2:07:19] and there was a recognition in both of
[2:07:21] our eyes
[2:07:22] and after they left i said
[2:07:24] did you feel that she said
[2:07:26] i did
[2:07:28] i said what was between you and i
[2:07:30] was gone it's gone and she said
[2:07:33] it is
[2:07:34] well
[2:07:35] for two years that nobody knew about
[2:07:38] except her and me and the doctor inside
[2:07:40] of her throat
[2:07:42] she had a border that was growing
[2:07:44] and she would swallow and she would feel
[2:07:46] it and then it grew it was getting
[2:07:47] bigger and bigger to the point
[2:07:49] to where she didn't have to swallow she
[2:07:52] could just feel it pressing and she told
[2:07:54] me and it's really easy to pray for
[2:07:57] somebody when when you ain't mad at them
[2:08:00] and when you ain't offended at them and
[2:08:01] you ain't holding something against them
[2:08:07] and so she told me about it and i just i
[2:08:10] put my hand over on her back we was like
[2:08:12] five minutes from church i just said
[2:08:13] lord
[2:08:14] you're still the same one that when
[2:08:17] women would come up in the prayer of the
[2:08:19] prophet's prayer line and you would
[2:08:21] cause the border to disappear from
[2:08:22] women's throat that's all i said we went
[2:08:25] on to church
[2:08:26] and and the brother brother dwayne
[2:08:28] jackson from from brother joe greens was
[2:08:30] preaching fabulous service and he was
[2:08:32] preaching for us and at the end of the
[2:08:34] service i just began to testify about
[2:08:37] god taking the offense out of my life
[2:08:39] towards my wife
[2:08:41] and hers towards me and she was on the
[2:08:43] organ and i said sweetheart would you
[2:08:44] mind if we pray for you
[2:08:46] and she said no so she comes down and i
[2:08:49] said i want the ministers i said no if
[2:08:51] you're a believer
[2:08:53] these signs shall follow them that
[2:08:55] believe see i said i'm not confining it
[2:08:58] to the ministry anymore i said i've got
[2:08:59] as much confidence in the housewife's
[2:09:01] prayer as i do the preacher's prayer
[2:09:05] and i said i want all y'all to come and
[2:09:06] lay hands on her and of course the
[2:09:08] ministers gathered and put their hands
[2:09:09] in everybody one behind the other and
[2:09:11] when the last one put their hands on
[2:09:13] each other i was getting ready to say
[2:09:15] let's pray
[2:09:16] if you know my wife she's a white woman
[2:09:18] she don't express too much but i was
[2:09:20] getting ready to turn and when i did i
[2:09:23] watched her bow under the spirit of god
[2:09:25] and the entire church began to scream as
[2:09:28] the spirit of god came down into that
[2:09:29] building
[2:09:33] and we couldn't do nothing but worship
[2:09:35] for 20 minutes
[2:09:37] no but we just praised god into this we
[2:09:39] was worshiping in our own way
[2:09:41] and when we got through she said can i
[2:09:43] testify my wife don't testify in church
[2:09:45] i said sure
[2:09:49] women have been given a bad rap in the
[2:09:51] message
[2:09:53] we put women ought we put all women as
[2:09:55] bad women
[2:09:58] and i thought that's just some man's
[2:10:00] idea of it
[2:10:02] the good ones are the best ones
[2:10:04] but anyway i won't i won't get on that
[2:10:07] but
[2:10:08] so
[2:10:09] she said
[2:10:11] within three seconds
[2:10:14] of everybody laying their hands on me
[2:10:16] she said i swallowed
[2:10:18] and it disappeared
[2:10:23] what was it
[2:10:24] it wasn't doctoring
[2:10:27] it wasn't quotes
[2:10:28] but it was letting the word come into my
[2:10:32] heart and her heart
[2:10:33] to repent and then openly repent before
[2:10:36] the church
[2:10:37] and i told the church i said if i have
[2:10:39] ever been offended at you i apologize
[2:10:41] because i don't want nothing standing
[2:10:43] between me and god working anymore
[2:10:46] do you realize that when the bride when
[2:10:49] she's waiting on the groom to go away to
[2:10:51] prepare a place you know what she's
[2:10:53] doing while she's waiting
[2:10:55] history says that she's making blankets
[2:10:58] meant and doing all this stuff in
[2:11:00] preparation and said she's mending
[2:11:01] broken relationships
[2:11:05] while she's waiting on her groom to come
[2:11:07] back
[2:11:09] brother brahm said if you have an ought
[2:11:10] it will keep you out
[2:11:15] that one was free
[2:11:17] listen to what he says
[2:11:19] he said the message is to the entire age
[2:11:21] which lasted about 120 years its message
[2:11:24] then is to all generations in that span
[2:11:27] now history keeps repeating itself
[2:11:31] in the generations of israel we see the
[2:11:34] revival in one generation only to see
[2:11:37] the fire spading in the next
[2:11:39] in the third generation embers may be
[2:11:43] glowing slightly
[2:11:45] but in the fourth there may be
[2:11:48] no vestige whatsoever
[2:11:51] of the original
[2:11:52] flame
[2:11:55] did they still have the word
[2:11:57] they sure did
[2:12:01] oh hallelujah
[2:12:02] then god lights the fire
[2:12:06] again
[2:12:08] where
[2:12:09] in the fourth
[2:12:10] generation
[2:12:12] when man has laid out everything he can
[2:12:14] lay out and teach everything he can
[2:12:16] teach and it's not produced nothing
[2:12:18] and it takes the fire of god and hides
[2:12:21] it under
[2:12:23] all of the refuse all of the the stuff
[2:12:25] that's not exactly right and it's just
[2:12:28] maybe an ember
[2:12:33] think about this
[2:12:34] and this what excited me
[2:12:38] if it's the fourth generation where god
[2:12:40] re-lights the fire
[2:12:43] [Music]
[2:12:46] i got to thinking about it since the
[2:12:48] time of the prophet
[2:12:50] there was my father
[2:12:52] one generation
[2:12:54] there's me and my brothers and sisters
[2:12:56] is the second generation
[2:12:58] there's my children which the third
[2:12:59] generation and now i have grandchildren
[2:13:04] and you know what i'm seeing everywhere
[2:13:05] start to happen
[2:13:10] it's repeating itself again
[2:13:13] god is bringing fire back
[2:13:16] you know why
[2:13:17] i said god don't let me get so old
[2:13:20] that i can't ever feel the fire of god
[2:13:22] let me get closer and closer to the
[2:13:24] altar of god
[2:13:26] there's going to be children
[2:13:28] of a fourth watch revival
[2:13:30] you know why because it was in the
[2:13:32] fourth watch when jesus himself come
[2:13:35] walking out upon the darkest hour
[2:13:37] brother brahm says when it looks like
[2:13:39] the messenger and the message has been
[2:13:42] defeated
[2:13:44] then god himself comes out
[2:13:46] see you don't need to defend nothing why
[2:13:49] because god himself is now in the
[2:13:52] process of re-lighting the fire young
[2:13:55] people don't you worry if you're less
[2:13:57] than 50 you can have a revival but it's
[2:14:00] not going to be around man's ideas it's
[2:14:02] not going to be around doctrine it's the
[2:14:04] spirit of god the holy ghost in you
[2:14:06] taking you back to the original word
[2:14:09] with the original inspiration back to
[2:14:12] the faith that was once delivered to the
[2:14:14] saints why because he's going to
[2:14:16] reproduce another bride
[2:14:19] brother branham seen the bride and she
[2:14:21] got out a step and then he seen a church
[2:14:23] in between but then he seen another
[2:14:26] bride every kindred nation and tongue
[2:14:28] come around and she got out of step and
[2:14:31] watched he screamed get back in line get
[2:14:33] back in step that's what the holy
[2:14:36] spirit's saying get back in line with
[2:14:38] the original word with the original
[2:14:41] inspiration because i'm going to have a
[2:14:43] bride she's going to be without spot
[2:14:47] she's going to be without blemish she's
[2:14:50] going to be a perfect holy one
[2:14:53] because she is flesh of my flesh
[2:14:55] she is born in my bones
[2:14:58] she is who i am and i am who she is
[2:15:02] god bless you come brother
[2:15:05] hallelujah
[2:15:20] amen
[2:15:22] you good my brother
[2:15:24] you did probably better than me
[2:15:26] [Laughter]
[2:15:29] amen let's give the lord a hand again
[2:15:36] [Applause]
[2:15:38] hallelujah blessed be the name of the
[2:15:41] lord
[2:15:42] you know
[2:15:43] i was talking to uh
[2:15:46] to a parent one day
[2:15:50] and then the parent was explaining me
[2:15:55] what was going on between uh
[2:15:58] his child one of his child and his
[2:16:01] mother
[2:16:03] and then i caught it i say
[2:16:05] what is happening really
[2:16:07] the child is not trying to disrespect
[2:16:10] the mother
[2:16:13] i say that's not the case it's appearing
[2:16:16] like that but it's not the case
[2:16:20] i say what happened is the child
[2:16:23] got so much ammunition
[2:16:27] do you hear me
[2:16:28] this child have opened up to a different
[2:16:32] word
[2:16:36] about here and the child swallowed the
[2:16:39] message differently than before
[2:16:43] because the child was in the message
[2:16:45] but now the child moves under a
[2:16:48] different ministry
[2:16:50] and the message is made real to the
[2:16:53] child now
[2:16:55] and once a message is made real like
[2:16:58] that
[2:16:59] they don't tolerate
[2:17:03] sin anymore
[2:17:05] they will shoot at that quickly
[2:17:09] amen
[2:17:10] and old folks will look and say brother
[2:17:12] i just want to let you know that uh
[2:17:16] maybe you need to watch what you're
[2:17:17] doing that's an old person
[2:17:19] a child that got the revelation of the
[2:17:21] message they just move straight they say
[2:17:23] this is not what brother brown i'm
[2:17:25] saying brother brown i'm saying this and
[2:17:27] this is wrong straight ahead
[2:17:29] and it might appear offensive
[2:17:34] do you get what i'm saying
[2:17:36] do you get what i'm saying but really
[2:17:39] the child is not mad at anybody
[2:17:42] it's just
[2:17:43] they
[2:17:44] realize
[2:17:46] where they were
[2:17:48] and what they struggle with
[2:17:51] and what they went through and now when
[2:17:53] that word is charging it causes
[2:17:56] something that looks like a rebellion
[2:18:00] but it's not really rebellion it's they
[2:18:02] just got tired of everything they've
[2:18:05] seen all along
[2:18:07] until they understood that this message
[2:18:09] was so simple
[2:18:11] and the message was jesus christ himself
[2:18:15] manifested in this end time
[2:18:19] everybody care
[2:18:20] about here and if you don't understand
[2:18:22] the child you can miss him
[2:18:25] anybody care you might think he's
[2:18:27] against the parent or since these
[2:18:29] children begin to read the cod the
[2:18:32] they're kind of hard-headed they're not
[2:18:34] hard-headed
[2:18:36] anybody here they're just receiving the
[2:18:40] engrafted word
[2:18:41] so clear and as a revelation
[2:18:45] that they don't tolerate
[2:18:47] anything anymore
[2:18:49] amen
[2:18:50] the key is there this message is right
[2:18:54] this message is the very person of jesus
[2:18:57] christ anybody care but you need to have
[2:19:00] a revelation of that message
[2:19:03] for you to stand because people grew up
[2:19:07] in this message they are no longer in
[2:19:09] this message
[2:19:10] people preach this message they're no
[2:19:12] longer in this message
[2:19:13] anybody here people were deacon where
[2:19:16] trustees were all kind of stuff in this
[2:19:18] message they're all backsliding because
[2:19:21] they run without a message
[2:19:24] because they thought they have the
[2:19:25] message they had the religion
[2:19:28] part of it the intellectual part of it
[2:19:31] but they missed the revelation
[2:19:33] but once
[2:19:34] you get this message
[2:19:37] a true revelation of the message there
[2:19:39] is nothing in this life that you can
[2:19:42] compare with it
[2:19:43] amen
[2:19:45] i told somebody i said the more i read
[2:19:47] brother branham the more i love the
[2:19:49] bible
[2:19:50] he said the person that make me love the
[2:19:52] bible more i never seen a preacher that
[2:19:55] makes me love the bible so much like
[2:19:58] brother branham
[2:19:59] and now when i read the bible it's a
[2:20:01] complete new book i see this i see this
[2:20:04] i see this i see this i see i see things
[2:20:07] all over
[2:20:09] so when you say preach
[2:20:11] the bible where were you preaching
[2:20:14] all this time
[2:20:16] we were preaching the bible
[2:20:18] anybody here we were already preaching
[2:20:21] the bible you just missed the revelation
[2:20:25] amen like the messenger that came they
[2:20:27] said what did you hear i heard noise i
[2:20:30] heard this i heard this and then it we
[2:20:32] draw a lot of doctrine left and right
[2:20:35] this doctrine this doctrine destruction
[2:20:38] and before you know it the fire is gone
[2:20:41] but you won't kill the revival of god
[2:20:44] because you this message was a true
[2:20:46] revival brother branham say watch every
[2:20:49] one of them after three years they
[2:20:50] denominate he said but watch this one it
[2:20:53] says been 15 years
[2:20:55] you cannot
[2:20:56] amen the person was just hidden
[2:20:59] and let men do the show
[2:21:01] and around the show they run the show
[2:21:03] they run the show
[2:21:05] when the time of the show is finished
[2:21:07] now he's shaking everything and
[2:21:09] reconfirming back
[2:21:11] that this message
[2:21:13] was the person of jesus christ he was
[2:21:16] sent to prepare you to meet the lord
[2:21:18] jesus christ amen
[2:21:21] amen so now nobody can separate you from
[2:21:24] it
[2:21:27] hallelujah because you got a revelation
[2:21:29] of the message you meet the person of
[2:21:32] the message it's a different story
[2:21:35] amen like philip asked the eunuch he
[2:21:37] said what do you read do you understand
[2:21:40] what you read he was reading the prophet
[2:21:42] but he did not understand the prophet
[2:21:45] and the prophet and he looks and the way
[2:21:48] isaiah described jesus christ
[2:21:53] the eunuch thought that isaiah was
[2:21:56] talking about himself
[2:22:01] hallelujah the way brother branham
[2:22:03] described and demonstrated this message
[2:22:08] you will think brother branham was
[2:22:09] talking about himself
[2:22:11] that's why he turned around he said
[2:22:13] listen you're not feeding on the word of
[2:22:15] man
[2:22:16] the voice is brother branham but that
[2:22:19] message is the unfailing body word of
[2:22:22] the son of man and philip took the same
[2:22:25] scripture that the eunuch thought
[2:22:28] that phil that isaiah was talking about
[2:22:31] himself and he pulled jesus christ out
[2:22:34] of that scripture
[2:22:36] and he saw that jesus christ was wrapped
[2:22:39] up in isaiah
[2:22:42] he just needed a revelation and when he
[2:22:45] needed a revelation do you know what
[2:22:46] happened
[2:22:47] god took the ministry off
[2:22:52] that was it and the eunuch left and went
[2:22:55] you can never change the eunuch anymore
[2:22:58] amen the way remember he came to
[2:23:01] jerusalem to worship
[2:23:03] amen but thou eunic was a different
[2:23:05] unique than every other time that he
[2:23:07] came to jerusalem because now the
[2:23:10] scriptures are made manifested they can
[2:23:13] see that hey this is not a man
[2:23:15] no this is a vessel that the yo that the
[2:23:17] lord used to bring a channel of
[2:23:20] inspiration and through that we're
[2:23:22] feeding on the word of god and we're
[2:23:25] moving forward amen
[2:23:27] that's why you need your personal
[2:23:30] revelation for this message and then
[2:23:33] this message nobody will push you to
[2:23:35] listen to the tape nobody will push you
[2:23:38] to read the sermon you yourself somebody
[2:23:40] new will be talking about
[2:23:42] go ahead and push that
[2:23:45] you don't have nobody to tell you to
[2:23:47] push play that person will tell you to
[2:23:49] push play amen and when you push play
[2:23:52] you begin to listen to that same sermon
[2:23:55] that you listen before that you heard
[2:23:57] people preach before but when you listen
[2:24:00] to it it seems like
[2:24:02] this is something different no it was
[2:24:04] already laying there amen
[2:24:07] but it's no more interpretation of man
[2:24:09] anymore it is the holy spirit himself
[2:24:13] working right there amen
[2:24:16] so we thank god for the message of the
[2:24:18] hour and brother tim that was wonderful
[2:24:21] god richly bless you amen
[2:24:24] amen
[2:24:26] hallelujah
[2:24:28] hallelujah the absolute
[2:24:30] the absolute
[2:24:32] the bible is the absolute
[2:24:35] i don't have any problem with that and i
[2:24:36] believe it
[2:24:38] but the absolute interpretation
[2:24:42] of the bible is the message of the hour
[2:24:47] and that absolute have to leave both the
[2:24:49] bible and the message and become a true
[2:24:52] revelation into you
[2:24:54] then nobody will shake you away
[2:24:57] anybody care
[2:24:59] nobody will shake you away they can give
[2:25:00] you all kind of video all kind of stuff
[2:25:04] it would never shake your way somebody
[2:25:06] gave me a video
[2:25:08] trying to make me doubt the message
[2:25:12] and i listen i listen i listen i listen
[2:25:15] i finish
[2:25:16] and that person asks me say what do you
[2:25:18] think about it i say nothing
[2:25:21] he said really i said nothing he said
[2:25:24] that's powerful i say nothing i say it
[2:25:27] didn't do anything to me
[2:25:29] [Music]
[2:25:31] hell but here matter of fact he helped
[2:25:33] me use more ammunition against it
[2:25:41] amen
[2:25:44] hallelujah hallelujah this message is
[2:25:46] beautiful amen
[2:25:48] we want to have the absolute not a
[2:25:50] relative what the brother was laboring
[2:25:53] is trying to show you that we already
[2:25:55] got the absolute
[2:25:57] but the ministry has been playing with
[2:25:59] the absolute and manipulating the word
[2:26:03] and that caused the fire brother branham
[2:26:05] say when man when you don't repeat what
[2:26:07] the messengers say the revival dies
[2:26:10] but when you go back to the pure word
[2:26:12] to the absolute not what somebody else
[2:26:15] interpreted not this camp that camp this
[2:26:18] camp but we go back to the pure message
[2:26:21] and when it's laid out automatically the
[2:26:24] pillar of fire will follow the ark of
[2:26:26] the covenant once you put the ark back
[2:26:29] in the tabernacle you don't sit there
[2:26:31] and call the pillar of fire you say
[2:26:32] peter of fire come to the tabernacle no
[2:26:35] the pillar of fire was just waiting they
[2:26:37] put the table of the show break they put
[2:26:39] the candle stick
[2:26:40] when once they brought the ark and put
[2:26:42] it right there the pillar of fire
[2:26:44] automatically step into the building and
[2:26:47] when he got there the ministry took the
[2:26:49] hand off
[2:26:51] now he was the holy spirit through the
[2:26:53] entire congregation
[2:26:55] ministering and doing his own thing amen
[2:26:58] blessed be the name of the lord let's
[2:27:00] pray
[2:27:01] heavenly father
[2:27:03] lord we are approaching you humbly
[2:27:06] father tonight again and thanking you

[2:27:14] been doing for us
[2:27:16] father we thank you because after going
[2:27:18] through a lot of shaking
[2:27:21] and everything that we thought was chaos
[2:27:24] now we begin to realize that it's not a
[2:27:27] chaos
[2:27:28] it is the rising king
[2:27:30] that is rising with power
[2:27:33] and further keeping your own way
[2:27:36] and demonstrating to your children
[2:27:38] that the era of man
[2:27:41] the era of calvinism
[2:27:44] the era of armenianism
[2:27:46] the era of any deviation
[2:27:49] is gone
[2:27:51] now it's back to the pure world
[2:27:54] when your children are gonna be so
[2:27:56] confined into the word and so in tune
[2:28:00] and intimate with that word
[2:28:03] until that word will become flesh
[2:28:06] and we're gonna see a living episode
[2:28:09] true thunders lord father people that
[2:28:12] are radiating the message with their
[2:28:14] life
[2:28:15] until if somebody never read a book or
[2:28:18] never probably listen to a call to a
[2:28:21] message tape when they see a believer
[2:28:24] they can tell that this person is
[2:28:26] different do we still have this kind of
[2:28:29] species on earth
[2:28:31] after everything that is going on
[2:28:34] lord when we walk outside we see women
[2:28:36] almost completely naked
[2:28:39] we see man going bare chest we see
[2:28:42] craziness and perversion and everything
[2:28:45] that is unfitted for your children to be
[2:28:47] even living on this world but father by
