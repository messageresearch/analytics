[19:21] a daily devotion to a few of us every
[19:24] morning
[19:25] and uh
[19:26] i went and i went back again actually
[19:28] and listened to the one monday prior to
[19:31] his parent his mom and sister and
[19:33] everybody
[19:34] in the accident
[19:36] and it was on suffering i shared it with
[19:38] a small group on um
[19:41] on our what's that but it was about
[19:42] suffering
[19:44] suffering for god for christ
[19:48] well you know it's it's been a few days
[19:50] since he's had any anything obviously
[19:52] he's been taking care of you know
[19:54] grieving and taking care of
[19:56] the business with his dad i'm sure but
[19:58] um he sent one out again this morning
[20:00] and he pointed out how the last one that
[20:02] he did was it was concerning suffering
[20:06] and i i don't know if he's been getting
[20:08] questions from people
[20:11] but one thought was very strong in his
[20:13] in his uh
[20:15] in his text this morning it was
[20:18] don't go back don't give up
[20:21] he said it doesn't matter
[20:22] how you suffer how much suffering he
[20:25] said don't even give consideration
[20:28] to leaving this message
[20:30] and going back don't even let the con
[20:34] the thought come up to be considered
[20:37] that's a lesson for every one of us
[20:41] and amen amen amen
[20:47] amen
[20:51] and and that's that's a lot of suffering
[20:53] that they just they're still i'm sure
