[20:25] okay
[20:27] after that uh our brother has a
[20:29] testimony
[20:32] okay we
[20:34] it's of course
[20:36] okay all right
[20:38] so after that our brother has a
[20:39] testimony man
[20:46] [Music]
[21:01] amen
[21:02] yeah so um last monday um this song um
[21:06] kept coming to me and i was singing it
[21:09] the whole day
[21:10] so
[21:11] in um during the afternoon i was
[21:15] singing the song to my husband and
[21:18] i was telling him how the song is really
[21:20] short and i really wish
[21:21] i can add
[21:23] some of the lyrics to it
[21:25] so in the car
[21:27] i wrote like the second stanza of the
[21:29] song
[21:30] so later on in the evening
[21:32] i kept singing the song but i didn't
[21:34] know why the song kept coming
[21:37] then i remembered it was exactly one
[21:39] year i had a surgery
[21:41] um they took out my thyroid and
[21:45] when they i had that surgery um
[21:48] a week before the surgery they took the
[21:51] thyroid they did a biopsy test and
[21:54] they they did it to find out if
[21:57] it's there is a cancer or anything and
[22:00] they couldn't find anything so a week
[22:02] later they did the surgery and it was a
[22:04] very
[22:06] um it was very intense that i ended up
[22:09] in the icu so
[22:11] when i was discharged two weeks later i
[22:14] went to do a follow up with the doctor
[22:17] and he was telling me that
[22:20] mr close you are a miracle
[22:22] because after the surgery they did the
[22:25] thyroid they took out they tested and
[22:27] found out that
[22:29] it had cancer
[22:30] and for them for the tarot to turn into
[22:33] cancer that means it's been sitting
[22:35] there for quite a long time it's been
[22:37] more than
[22:39] a year
[22:40] so he was like that thing could have
[22:43] moved to your lungs
[22:44] and you would have been dead but
[22:48] what surprises him is they did a week to
[22:50] the surgery they did a biopsy test and
[22:53] couldn't find anything
[22:55] but he told me they've taken
[22:57] everything out and there is nothing to
[22:59] worry about
[23:01] so i lost before the surgery he told me
[23:04] i was gonna lose 25 percent of my vocal
[23:07] cord i wouldn't be able to sing
[23:10] you know so it was i couldn't talk and
[23:13] he said i need to do a speech therapy
[23:16] and if that does not work then they have
[23:18] to go back in and fix the vocal cord but
[23:22] then he says something he said
[23:24] i know you're a miracle child and
[23:27] god is going to
[23:29] see you through this too and i really
[23:32] believed in that and today i'm here
[23:35] singing and i really want to sing
[23:38] the song i wrote i want to sing to
[23:40] glorify the name of the lord amen

[40:24] it means they were not really speaking
[40:26] the same thing
[40:28] so there is a difference right here
[40:31] there is a difference right here
[40:35] in
[40:36] sermon
[40:38] or in preaching
[40:42] i have to
[40:43] reach a certain point so you'll be ready
[40:45] for sunday amen
[40:48] now i beseech you brethren by the name
[40:50] of our lord jesus christ that you all
[40:53] speak
[40:54] the same thing
[40:55] watch now come on
[40:58] and that there be no what
[41:07] speak the same thing the second thing is
[41:10] what
[41:11] no division
[41:14] because when we begin to speak different
[41:16] things
[41:18] one from another then we are divided
[41:23] everybody here
[41:24] paul was the messenger of the age
[41:28] paul was the pastor of the age
[41:32] and paul is instructing the age the
[41:34] people to stay to speak the same thing
[41:37] because when they don't speak the same
[41:39] thing it's going to cause confusion and
[41:41] bring the vision amen
[41:43] hallelujah
[41:45] that there be no division among you
[41:48] but
[41:49] that you perfectly join together
[41:53] amen
[41:54] perfectly
[41:56] how can you be joined together perfectly
[41:59] you must have a bond of perfection
[42:03] everybody
[42:05] paul want them to be joined perfectly
[42:09] join perfectly
[42:12] everybody care but to be joined
[42:14] perfectly you need the bound of love
[42:18] because the bond of love is the bond of
[42:20] perfection you know that scripture right
[42:23] so you need love
[42:26] but who give love
[42:30] you remember roman 5
[42:32] who shared the love of god in your heart
[42:35] thank you
[42:38] everybody
[42:40] the holy ghost
[42:44] holy ghost brings the love of god and
[42:46] you abandoned perfectly
[42:48] amen
[42:49] blessed be the name of the lord
[42:52] but that should be perfectly joined
[42:54] together
[42:55] in the same mind
[42:58] and in the same water
[43:02] the mind
[43:03] this joint
[43:05] must be in the same mind
[43:11] and the same word
[43:15] anybody care
[43:18] in other words
[43:20] if i see something wrong here
[43:24] there is no way you can make it right
[43:29] let me repeat it again
[43:30] if you see something wrong
[43:33] there is no way i can say it's right
[43:36] if it's wrong by the word
[43:39] is that okay now
[43:40] in other words when the word declare it
[43:43] wrong
[43:45] me and you we must speak the same thing
[43:49] we cannot say it's right when the word
[43:51] is already saying wrong
[43:54] because sometimes you bring up something
[43:56] and somebody will say well i don't see
[43:58] anything wrong with it
[44:00] so we are speaking
[44:01] two different languages
[44:04] amen
[44:06] hallelujah i wish this whole church was
[44:08] here amen
[44:10] for it has been declared to me of you my
[44:13] brethren
[44:14] [Music]
[44:15] what did you declare it paul what what
[44:17] what some what did somebody report to
[44:20] you
[44:20] it has been declared to you my brethren
[44:24] by them which are of the house of chloe
[44:27] that they are contentions
[44:30] among you in either world they are they
[44:33] are argument quarrel among you the
[44:36] reason why i want you to all speak the
[44:39] same thing
[44:40] no division i want you to be perfectly
[44:42] joined same mind same judgment in other
[44:45] words when they speak to one
[44:47] and they speak to somebody else
[44:49] you cannot break into in between them
[44:53] do you hear me
[44:54] if i'm speaking to brother
[44:57] kelly
[44:58] and i speak to brother mike daly you
[45:00] will think we were speaking
[45:04] other words it's just like you're
[45:05] speaking to the same person
[45:07] amen
[45:08] and when there is a unity like that you
[45:10] cannot break it
[45:12] then everything is strong
[45:14] if brother mike can barely speak one
[45:15] thing and brother kelly speaks something
[45:17] different the devil understand that
[45:19] there is a season
[45:21] then the devil can begin to work
[45:23] but if you come to brother mike devi
[45:25] there you say no it's wrong you go to
[45:28] brother kerry brother kelly say no it's
[45:30] wrong in other words when you go to
[45:33] daddy daddy say it's wrong
[45:36] if you try to work with mommy mommy say
[45:38] it's wrong then the child will change
[45:41] [Music]
[45:44] if daddy say it's wrong and mom is the
[45:46] loser then the child understand
[45:50] if mommy is the one standing firm and
[45:52] that is the loss then the child will
[45:54] understand where to work
[45:57] because you're not speaking the same
[45:59] language
[46:01] everybody okay
[46:02] and uh and this is a result of query
[46:06] contentions
[46:08] contention
[46:11] contentions
[46:13] under
[46:14] a church
[46:18] of paul
[46:22] was paul wrong
[46:24] was paul arguing
[46:30] amen
[46:32] let's go to verse 12. now this i say
[46:35] that every one of you say i am of paul
[46:42] everybody here
[46:45] everybody say i am of paul
[46:48] and i of apollos
[46:51] and i of who
[46:53] save us and i of who
[46:56] four people
[47:00] among this group
[47:02] under the messenger of paul
[47:04] some got caught up with paul
[47:11] sam got caught up with cephas
[47:14] which is peter
[47:16] everybody
[47:18] some got caught up with apollos
[47:24] a teacher
[47:27] right
[47:28] and some caught up with christ
[47:32] this one we must say this is a good one
[47:36] because it's crust
[47:39] that's that's the tendency
[47:41] or the one with paul is wrong the one
[47:43] with her powers is wrong the one is this
[47:45] this maybe the one with christ is right
[47:48] all of them are wrong
[47:53] because they are doing this under
[47:56] contention
[48:01] i hope the whole church will listen to
[48:04] this
[48:05] because somebody need to come out
[48:06] certain things
[48:08] and then we move on roof serving
[48:11] amen
[48:12] hallelujah
[48:14] i thank god uh verse 13
[48:16] is christ divided
[48:19] you say you are of christ but why do you
[48:21] have division
[48:23] if you really got into christ
[48:26] why do you have a division
[48:28] so your clinging to christ is not
[48:30] correct
[48:31] it's not
[48:32] genuine
[48:34] amen
[48:35] everybody
[48:36] even though you say christ
[48:39] because we know the message is christ
[48:44] anybody here even you're clinging to the
[48:47] message of the hour
[48:52] amen
[48:54] but you are wrong
[48:57] not because christ is wrong
[49:01] oh my god
[49:03] is christ divided
[49:06] was paul crucified for you
[49:10] when he speak about christ
[49:12] he's not saying was christ crucified for
[49:15] you because we already know
[49:18] christ
[49:19] is he divided
[49:21] no
[49:21] because the body is one
[49:23] everybody
[49:24] but when it comes to paul
[49:27] he says is paul crucified for you
[49:32] everybody
[49:35] how can paul get to the point where he
[49:37] begin to ask them of
[49:39] the crucifixion
[49:41] because we know the one who was
[49:43] crucified was jesus christ
[49:46] was christ
[49:47] was paul crucified for you
[49:50] or were you baptized in the name of
[49:52] water
[49:54] if you notice paul is not touching
[49:56] cephas and apollos
[49:58] it's about the crucifixion and the water
[50:02] what do you see there
[50:07] okay somebody begin to read what do you
[50:10] see between the two
[50:11] crucify the altar
[50:14] everybody and the baptist may deliver
[50:18] other court
[50:25] all over the scripture
[50:27] now your eyes are open
[50:29] amen
[50:30] let's go to galatians chapter one
[50:32] hallelujah
[50:36] oh
[50:38] that's a tabernacle language
[50:42] amen
[50:44] lord help me with time wednesday
[50:49] galatians chapter 1 verse 13.
[50:52] if you dare you can say amen
[50:55] for you have heard
[50:57] of my conversation
[51:00] the devil is playing around but he's
[51:02] wasting his time
[51:04] you have heard of my
[51:07] that conversation.com
[51:08] doesn't mean talking
[51:10] amen
[51:11] it means my way of life or my previous
[51:14] life my life everybody
[51:16] you have heard of my life or my
[51:18] conversation in time past
[51:21] in the jewish religion
[51:24] everybody here
[51:26] how that beyond measure
[51:28] i persecuted the church of god and
[51:32] wasted
[51:33] so paul
[51:34] under religion
[51:37] not any kind of religion not a worldly
[51:39] religion
[51:40] under a jewish religion
[51:44] america
[51:46] we thought by religion he's going to be
[51:48] a good man
[51:49] but he ended up doing what he persecuted
[51:54] everybody
[51:55] and wasted the church
[51:57] how can you be under the religion of a
[51:59] jewish and you're persecuting the church
[52:05] and destroying the church
[52:09] in the presence
[52:11] of
[52:12] working
[52:13] or doing service
[52:17] for god
[52:21] amen
[52:23] verse
[52:24] 14
[52:26] and prophetic in the jewish religion
[52:29] above many my equals
[52:32] my own age
[52:34] in my own nation
[52:36] being more exceedingly zealous
[52:39] of the gospel of god
[52:43] okay somebody is awake he's zeal was not
[52:47] about the gospel
[52:50] he's beat his zeal i was zealous of the
[52:53] tradition of my father
[52:57] amen there is a difference between the
[53:00] law
[53:02] and the tradition
[53:04] everybody
[53:06] the law was the word of god given
[53:09] anybody care
[53:11] but the traditions
[53:13] where a hanged down belief
[53:16] no something that the people believe
[53:20] have belief and that the
[53:22] they gave it back to somebody else
[53:25] down
[53:26] they transferred because remember jesus
[53:29] say by your water
[53:32] by your tradition you remember mark 7
[53:35] you make the word
[53:36] the word of god of water
[53:38] so tradition destroyed the word of god
[53:42] the word of god is pure that's the law
[53:44] do not kill do not steal
[53:47] no problem anybody here when you go to
[53:49] the altar this is what you do but when
[53:51] the pharisee came they begin to chant
[53:54] they say no if you swear by the altar
[53:56] you remember or if you swear by the gift
[53:58] of the altar that is a tradition they
[54:01] begin to destroy the word of god
[54:03] anybody care so paul was not zealous
[54:06] really of the word of god
[54:09] because if you believe the word of god
[54:11] that came by moses
[54:14] jesus taught the pharisee if you would
[54:17] have believed moses
[54:18] you would have done water
[54:21] automatically you're going to believe me
[54:23] anybody care so when you have the zeal
[54:26] for the word of god it will lead you to
[54:29] jesus christ
[54:30] but when you have deserved for the
[54:33] traditions
[54:35] of the fathers
[54:37] everybody here the tradition that
[54:40] somebody took from the law and built
[54:44] anybody here
[54:45] then you can find yourself persecuting
[54:48] something that is correct
[54:50] of fighting against the very manifested
[54:54] word of the hour
[54:56] or finding a guest somebody who have a
[54:59] good position in the world
[55:02] because your pr in other words when
[55:04] people preach some people preach through
[55:07] the word of god
[55:08] and some people preach through the
[55:10] tradition that they receive
[55:13] from somebody else
[55:15] the one under tradition
[55:18] have a tendency to persecute the one
[55:21] that is staying with the world
[55:25] the one under tradition have a tendency
[55:29] to persecute the one that sticks with
[55:32] the message of the hour
[55:37] [Music]
[55:41] i hope minister will learn a lesson not
[55:43] you here i'm talking about somebody
[55:45] who's going to get in anybody care
[55:48] but
[55:49] hallelujah
[55:51] i have to change
[55:54] the battery
[55:57] the battery is seven hours or something
[56:01] are you okay with my voice
[56:04] if not i take the bazooka but i love to
[56:06] be free
[56:07] amen
[56:10] okay
[56:14] give me one second
[56:27] you got it
[56:28] okay
[56:29] praise god
[56:31] verse
[56:33] 15 but when he please god
[56:36] who separated me from my mother's womb
[56:40] everybody
[56:41] and call me by his water
[56:44] this thing that spared paul
[56:47] is because he was predestinated
[56:53] anybody care if he was not for
[56:56] predestination paul would have stuck
[56:59] here
[57:00] and go straight to hell
[57:02] amen
[57:03] so what saved paul
[57:05] was predestination
[57:11] and predestination
[57:13] with what grace
[57:17] anybody care
[57:19] if that does not you're going to stack
[57:21] yourself under someone
[57:23] anybody here
[57:25] to reveal
[57:27] his son in me
[57:29] that i
[57:31] might preach
[57:33] him among the hidden
[57:36] immediately in other words grace came
[57:40] to me
[57:41] when i was not even prepared one second
[57:52] praise god it's good
[57:55] okay
[57:56] so how many minutes did i lose by this
[58:00] somebody need to pay you back
[58:02] [Music]
[58:02] [Laughter]
[58:05] amen
[58:06] all right now you say
[58:09] but when he please god
[58:11] who separated me in other words in an
[58:13] appropriate time
[58:15] anybody care
[58:16] god came to me by grace
[58:19] when i was not even prepared and the
[58:21] reason why he came to me by grace
[58:23] remember on the road to damascus
[58:26] he told he paul he said why do you
[58:28] persecuted me amen when paul when god
[58:31] went to ananias and begin to speak to
[58:33] ananias god told ananias that paul was a
[58:37] chosen vessel
[58:39] anybody so because of predestination
[58:42] grace came to me everybody
[58:45] and when grace came to paul who was
[58:48] under the tradition of the father what
[58:53] was the reaction of paul when grace came
[58:56] to him
[58:59] everybody okay
[59:01] he said
[59:03] verse 16
[59:04] to reveal his son in me
[59:06] so now his personal revelation
[59:09] now he understand who jesus is that oh
[59:12] the lord the jehovah of the old
[59:14] testament now which jesus christ now his
[59:16] son is revealing me paul hey mark here
[59:20] that i might preach him among the hidden
[59:22] i need you paul
[59:25] immediately
[59:26] i confess not with flesh and blood
[59:32] anybody care
[59:34] so when that experience happened to me
[59:36] paul
[59:37] i learned a lesson
[59:41] anybody here
[59:42] i am no more trusting under men
[59:49] because i was doing this
[59:51] under men
[59:54] the high priest
[59:55] gave me the letter
[59:57] to go persecute people i was working for
[1:00:01] man
[1:00:02] everybody
[1:00:04] now that now i have a personal contact
[1:00:07] with jesus christ
[1:00:08] now from there on i learn not to be
[1:00:12] behind man
[1:00:16] everybody here because being behind what
[1:00:19] men were preaching
[1:00:20] caused me to persecute the word of god
[1:00:23] now i compare no more to flesh and blood
[1:00:27] no more am i following flesh
[1:00:30] and blood
[1:00:32] amen
[1:00:33] i never got converted and suddenly i'm
[1:00:36] looking where are the disciples of jesus
[1:00:38] christ peter peter tell me about jesus
[1:00:41] christ because i made the same mistake
[1:00:46] everybody okay
[1:00:48] but when paul we when paul separated
[1:00:51] himself
[1:00:52] and he came back
[1:00:54] he could rebuke peter
[1:00:56] [Music]
[1:00:58] and peter started before him
[1:01:03] [Music]
[1:01:04] this is tough
[1:01:06] everybody okay
[1:01:09] verse 17 neither went i up to water
[1:01:13] why you didn't go to jerusalem because
[1:01:15] the disciples are there
[1:01:18] normally you should go oh this is a
[1:01:19] wonderful news i need to go to the
[1:01:21] people that are preaching this news paul
[1:01:23] say i don't want to make that mistake
[1:01:25] again
[1:01:26] i was under the pharisee
[1:01:28] look what i did
[1:01:29] let me go back to myself and let me
[1:01:33] and the author
[1:01:35] of the world
[1:01:36] deal together because somebody told
[1:01:39] brother branham he said you don't know
[1:01:40] your bible brother branham says
[1:01:42] certainly i don't know my bible but i
[1:01:44] know the altar
[1:01:49] let me have a talk with the author
[1:01:54] so when i had an experience i have to
[1:01:56] separate a little bit and spend time
[1:01:58] with the author
[1:02:00] then i can go back to the prison
[1:02:03] and when paul goes to the present no
[1:02:05] influence
[1:02:07] he knows where he's standing
[1:02:09] you cannot push him around
[1:02:14] amen
[1:02:15] neither went i up to jerusalem to them
[1:02:18] which were what
[1:02:20] apostle when
[1:02:22] i didn't search quickly for who was with
[1:02:25] jesus quickly i learned amen everybody
[1:02:28] here i learned from there i'm gonna go
[1:02:31] to them later let me make sure me i
[1:02:34] understand what i am in
[1:02:36] anybody here
[1:02:38] but
[1:02:39] went
[1:02:40] into arabia
[1:02:42] and returned again to water
[1:02:45] then after how many years
[1:02:47] it took three years of separation
[1:02:51] no phone calls
[1:02:53] nothing
[1:02:54] why paul i want to be taught by the
[1:02:57] author of the book
[1:03:00] everybody here because if i make a
[1:03:02] mistake i might be repeating peter
[1:03:05] [Music]
[1:03:11] anybody here i can get caught up beyond
[1:03:14] peter remember the que the the christian
[1:03:18] of corinthians were caught up behind
[1:03:19] peter
[1:03:20] some were caught up behind apollos some
[1:03:23] were caught up behind paul
[1:03:27] oh god help me
[1:03:29] anybody care
[1:03:31] then after three years i went up to
[1:03:34] jerusalem to see who
[1:03:36] now me and peter we can talk about here
[1:03:39] and aboard with him 15 days and brother
[1:03:43] branham said when they met together
[1:03:46] because paul was already preaching
[1:03:47] without peter
[1:03:49] everybody here when paul and peter met
[1:03:52] together they are talking the same
[1:03:54] language
[1:03:56] brother kelly paul
[1:03:58] peter started before paul
[1:04:02] years ago
[1:04:04] but when they sit with peter they are
[1:04:07] fellowshipping
[1:04:09] when peter said remember the brazen
[1:04:11] altar he said yes i saw it too i
[1:04:13] preached it the other day too two years
[1:04:16] ago i preached it
[1:04:20] amen
[1:04:23] amen
[1:04:24] let's go to james chapter 2.
[1:04:27] oh god
[1:04:29] help me out
[1:04:32] hallelujah
[1:04:36] james chapter 2 verse 22.
[1:04:41] if you're there you can say amen
[1:04:44] say you have faith wrote with his work
[1:04:47] and by work was faith made what

[1:05:30] abraham believed god and he was imputed
[1:05:32] to him for righteousness and he was
[1:05:34] called the friend of god
[1:05:37] you see then how that by works managed
[1:05:41] justify and not by what
[1:05:44] likewise also was rahab
[1:05:47] the harlot remember on sunday amen
[1:05:50] when she received the messenger we would
[1:05:53] go back to rehab again and had send them
[1:05:56] out another way
[1:05:58] go to james chapter four
[1:06:02] if you're there you can say amen
[1:06:04] verse one
[1:06:08] from where
[1:06:09] comes wars

[1:06:14] fighting among you remember james
[1:06:17] is under the holy place
[1:06:20] paul said justify by faith
[1:06:22] the calvinist took it

[1:06:44] james is saying that the world that you
[1:06:47] have
[1:06:48] and the fighting that you have
[1:06:51] among you
[1:06:52] is coming from something that is still
[1:06:55] in your flesh
[1:06:59] here and we know the flesh is the other
[1:07:01] court
[1:07:04] here there is something in the other
[1:07:06] court that is causing the fastest
[1:07:09] remember paul in the conte in the
[1:07:11] corinthian church say i don't want you
[1:07:13] to have what
[1:07:16] because you have
[1:07:19] anybody okay
[1:07:21] let's pray
[1:07:24] heavenly father lord we thank you again
[1:07:27] father for your grace your love your
[1:07:29] mercy and for everything you have been
[1:07:31] doing for us
[1:07:32] father thank you for your presence here
[1:07:34] tonight and thank you for giving us an
[1:07:36] opportunity to be again into your house
[1:07:39] lord we have done what any man that you
[1:07:41] give ability to do can do father read
[1:07:44] the word of the scripture but it takes
[1:07:46] the holy spirit to unfold it to bless to
[1:07:49] heal to change father to reveal your
[1:07:52] word all of that takes the holy spirit
[1:07:55] father may you move me completely out of
[1:07:57] the way may you come tonight and speak
[1:07:59] to your children strengthen this church
[1:08:01] lord and may you open up your word so
[1:08:04] that they can receive the thought that
[1:08:06] you're trying to deliver tonight lord
[1:08:08] father we commit everything be the alpha
[1:08:10] and the omega in the name of jesus
[1:08:12] christ
[1:08:13] amen
[1:08:15] all right i'm going to read one more
[1:08:16] scripture in the book of revelation
[1:08:19] the bible says in revelation 3 verse 1
[1:08:22] and unto the angel of the age of sardis
[1:08:26] the age of saudis is the age of luther
[1:08:30] everybody okay
[1:08:32] sardis deal with luther
[1:08:34] anybody care
[1:08:36] these things say he that has the seven
[1:08:39] spirits of god we will handle it on
[1:08:41] sunday lord dwelling and the seven stars
[1:08:44] and i know that works
[1:08:47] the lutheran head works
[1:08:52] we thought the work was under um under
[1:08:54] the holy place
[1:08:56] i know that works
[1:08:58] what are the words
[1:09:00] that that has and what
[1:09:05] the words of the luther
[1:09:09] was a name
[1:09:13] amen
[1:09:14] not the name
[1:09:17] but a name
[1:09:19] because the name is the name of jesus
[1:09:21] christ
[1:09:22] the church bear the name of jesus christ
[1:09:25] but the lutheran have another name a new
[1:09:28] name
[1:09:30] which is not the name of jesus christ
[1:09:33] amen i know that you have a name that
[1:09:36] that livest and our work
[1:09:38] you cannot have the name of jesus christ
[1:09:41] and be dead
[1:09:44] america because he's the name of the
[1:09:46] high priest
[1:09:47] when you put him into the holiest you're
[1:09:49] going to have a resurrection
[1:09:51] but this name that the lutheran have is
[1:09:54] a name that when you have it
[1:09:56] you appear to be alive
[1:09:59] but spiritually you are dead naturally
[1:10:03] in that name in the nature you are alive
[1:10:08] people knows you but in the spiritual in
[1:10:10] the eyes of god when you carry that name
[1:10:13] you are dead
[1:10:15] and brother branham said that name was
[1:10:18] denomination
[1:10:23] it can be baptised it can be meptoids it
[1:10:25] can be whatever
[1:10:26] anybody care
[1:10:28] when you carry denomination or
[1:10:30] organization
[1:10:32] ever here you can exist in this world
[1:10:35] you can be recognized by the state all
[1:10:38] over the world but in the eyes of god
[1:10:40] you are
[1:10:42] dead because luther his plateau was the
[1:10:46] just they just shall live by what once
[1:10:50] you reach faith that's it
[1:10:52] he cannot produce work that is the
[1:10:54] second stage that is coming up with
[1:10:56] wesley so when they push
[1:10:59] not
[1:11:00] by the word of god but in a different
[1:11:03] way they produce name
[1:11:06] and the name produce works but those
[1:11:09] works are wrong before god everybody
[1:11:12] okay so far
[1:11:14] hallelujah relax we'll be okay
[1:11:17] be watchful brother branham say that
[1:11:19] word means alert
[1:11:21] and strengthen the things which remain
[1:11:24] brother branham said the things that
[1:11:26] were taught to them
[1:11:27] that are ready to water brother branham
[1:11:30] said die because they're going under
[1:11:32] organization
[1:11:34] they started good but whatever they
[1:11:36] built
[1:11:37] is ready to die
[1:11:39] everybody care now because they're gonna
[1:11:41] go into organization
[1:11:43] for i have not found that works what
[1:11:46] it was unfulfilled
[1:11:49] before who
[1:11:50] not before man
[1:11:52] before man it looks good it's a big
[1:11:55] church we are blossom we're doing great
[1:11:57] things but when god looks multiplied by
[1:12:00] zero
[1:12:01] dead
[1:12:02] before god
[1:12:05] what are we talking about tonight we
[1:12:07] started on the four fences of roof roof
[1:12:10] serving that was on sunday
[1:12:13] before we continue with roof serving i
[1:12:16] would like to open a bracket a
[1:12:17] parenthesis
[1:12:19] because if we don't get this you're not
[1:12:21] going to understand what is coming up
[1:12:24] with roof serving
[1:12:26] tonight is part nine roof
[1:12:29] under calvinism
[1:12:31] you ready
[1:12:32] when we spoke about confidence we
[1:12:35] talking about calvin
[1:12:38] all right
[1:12:39] say tight
[1:12:41] when we deal with the tabernacle we
[1:12:43] found out in the journey of roof
[1:12:46] that roof entered through the gate you
[1:12:48] already understand that he moved into
[1:12:51] roof deciding on the justification he
[1:12:53] went she went to the altar and then she
[1:12:56] went to the water baptism back here then
[1:12:59] we positioned ruth in the outer court
[1:13:02] and after that brother branham said that
[1:13:04] the messenger also are connected with
[1:13:07] this
[1:13:08] but we found out that the messenger have
[1:13:11] big babies
[1:13:14] luther have calvin
[1:13:16] wesley have armenians ever care and on
[1:13:20] sunday we move from the water baptism
[1:13:23] into the holy place
[1:13:25] roof serving where we're dealing with
[1:13:27] the holy place and moon and roof move up
[1:13:30] so in the holy place here
[1:13:33] we started with the candlestick
[1:13:36] last sunday
[1:13:37] we stopped somewhere everybody okay
[1:13:39] so before we move forward it is
[1:13:42] important to check calvin
[1:13:47] why is it important to understand calvin
[1:13:51] calvin
[1:13:52] was a deviation of luther
[1:13:58] everybody okay
[1:14:00] calvin
[1:14:02] luther came and say they just
[1:14:07] shall live by faith justification
[1:14:10] ever here
[1:14:11] luther preach his message reach his
[1:14:14] limit his talent and stop
[1:14:16] everybody
[1:14:17] when calvin came
[1:14:19] he took luther into an extreme
[1:14:23] that's why brother branham said he was
[1:14:25] an error
[1:14:26] anybody okay calvin took luther to the
[1:14:30] extreme
[1:14:32] he was a deviation
[1:14:34] from luther just like when wesley came
[1:14:38] wesley brought sanctification every care
[1:14:41] but when our menus came
[1:14:43] he took the out that's the
[1:14:45] sanctification to the extreme
[1:14:48] which became a deviation okay back here
[1:14:52] so the
[1:14:53] extremity of
[1:14:55] cavern
[1:14:57] amen
[1:14:58] was the very cause
[1:15:00] of the birth
[1:15:02] of wesley
[1:15:07] i will give you quote down the road i
[1:15:09] was removing
[1:15:11] but let me just quieten your nerve with
[1:15:13] one
[1:15:14] so calvin
[1:15:16] when he came
[1:15:18] he brought so much trouble
[1:15:21] until those trouble birth wesley
[1:15:26] brother brown says this i believe you
[1:15:28] and the camera are pretty good
[1:15:30] he says in the message birthman
[1:15:33] brother branham say then
[1:15:36] when the calvinist got the ugly or the
[1:15:39] anglican church in such a condition
[1:15:43] under the calvinistic doctrine
[1:15:46] until god raised up a water
[1:15:49] armenian doctrine which was who john
[1:15:52] wesley the old system had to do what
[1:15:56] in order for the new one to do whatever
[1:15:59] to come on i'm gonna give you a quote
[1:16:01] down the road where brother branham say
[1:16:03] wesley have to come to balance
[1:16:06] what calvin causes
[1:16:09] so calvin
[1:16:11] is the cause of god now opening the door
[1:16:15] unto sanctification because the church
[1:16:18] and the calvin got into a bad situation
[1:16:23] ruth
[1:16:24] under calvinism
[1:16:27] where are you taking me out
[1:16:29] if you remember when we spoke about the
[1:16:31] reformers
[1:16:32] luther and wesley
[1:16:34] were our reformers down the road i gave
[1:16:36] you the quote about the pentecostal
[1:16:38] everybody okay so far
[1:16:40] now luther and wesley had
[1:16:43] people that came under their ministry
[1:16:48] everybody okay
[1:16:50] they have babies
[1:16:53] and the biggest baby
[1:16:55] for luther and wesley one was calvin and
[1:16:59] another one was armenian
[1:17:02] the concept of babies
[1:17:04] under the messenger is very important
[1:17:09] anybody here
[1:17:10] when a messenger comes
[1:17:13] and he brings a message
[1:17:15] babies will be born under the messenger
[1:17:19] [Music]
[1:17:21] if you go to the book of joshua chapter
[1:17:24] 1 verse 1
[1:17:26] the bible says that now after the death
[1:17:28] of who
[1:17:30] moses the prophet
[1:17:34] moses the messenger
[1:17:36] moses the man of god for the hour
[1:17:40] moses the great prophet of exodus when
[1:17:44] he came
[1:17:45] he preached and he finished his ministry
[1:17:49] moses left something to israel
[1:17:56] everybody okay
[1:17:57] moses didn't leave israel bear
[1:18:02] moses produced the law
[1:18:06] everybody care which was the word of god
[1:18:09] because the bible say that the law came
[1:18:12] by who
[1:18:13] moses and grace came by jesus christ
[1:18:16] ever care so not only did moses
[1:18:20] produce the law but when moses was alive
[1:18:24] we found out that there were young men
[1:18:27] that were born under moses
[1:18:32] everybody okay
[1:18:34] one day god told moses come to the
[1:18:36] mountain
[1:18:37] when moses was coming to the mountain
[1:18:40] god tell him you tell you come with the
[1:18:42] elder but make sure all the elders stays
[1:18:45] there
[1:18:46] you
[1:18:47] and who
[1:18:49] and joshua come up a little bit higher
[1:18:51] so joshua was birthed
[1:18:55] everybody okay
[1:18:56] under the ministry of moses
[1:18:59] and he has been trained under moses
[1:19:04] we're talking about babies under a
[1:19:06] messenger anybody here
[1:19:09] the bible says here that he came after
[1:19:12] the death the departure of moses moses
[1:19:15] is no longer on the scene but moses left
[1:19:18] the word of god
[1:19:19] everybody can use the word and continue
[1:19:22] with god
[1:19:23] he came to pass that the lord speak unto
[1:19:26] joshua the son of none moses water
[1:19:30] so moses had a minister that came under
[1:19:32] him
[1:19:33] and that minister was joshua
[1:19:36] anybody here
[1:19:38] but the problem is this
[1:19:40] when you are born under a prophet
[1:19:47] when you are born under a messenger
[1:19:51] when you are born under a major pastor
[1:19:55] of the edge
[1:19:56] there are certain condition that you
[1:19:59] must follow
[1:20:04] amen everybody okay
[1:20:06] what are those conditions brother
[1:20:08] stephen
[1:20:09] stay tight on the internet
[1:20:11] joshua 1 verse 5
[1:20:14] god said there shall not any man be able
[1:20:18] to stand before thee all the days of
[1:20:20] your life everybody will say amen what a
[1:20:24] promise
[1:20:24] praise god
[1:20:26] as i was with who
[1:20:29] joshua you are a a minister that is born
[1:20:34] under moses
[1:20:36] and since you are born under moses
[1:20:39] everybody okay
[1:20:40] as i was with moses
[1:20:44] anybody okay i'm gonna continue with you
[1:20:49] everybody okay
[1:20:50] moses didn't get to the promised land
[1:20:54] god took him off
[1:20:56] but joshua had the responsibility
[1:20:59] to take as a minister to take israel
[1:21:04] all the children of god and make sure
[1:21:07] they'll go all the way into the promised
[1:21:10] land and position everybody in the press
[1:21:17] ever here
[1:21:19] blessed be the name of the lord brother
[1:21:21] branham said the peanut of fire
[1:21:24] that was with moses everybody
[1:21:26] turned to the captain of the host
[1:21:29] we already went into that
[1:21:31] it was the same characteristic take off
[1:21:33] your shoes take off your shoe the same
[1:21:35] thing it's just the pillar of fire
[1:21:37] immorphy into a man
[1:21:41] everybody okay
[1:21:42] now he said as i was with moses so will
[1:21:46] i be with thee i will not fail thee nor
[1:21:49] forsake thee
[1:21:51] maybe joshua got excited he said praise
[1:21:53] god thank you jesus thank you lord
[1:21:56] he said be strong
[1:21:58] yes father and of good courage
[1:22:01] for unto these people shall that divide
[1:22:05] for an inheritance the land we shall
[1:22:07] swear unto the father to give them
[1:22:11] only be strong and very courageous
[1:22:14] joshua say thank you lord thank you
[1:22:16] jesus
[1:22:18] what is wrong that damn mayors observed
[1:22:25] to do
[1:22:26] according to water
[1:22:29] when you are born under
[1:22:31] a ministry like moses
[1:22:34] under a messenger
[1:22:36] under prophet
[1:22:37] they are conditioned that you must be
[1:22:40] under
[1:22:41] you must do
[1:22:45] all
[1:22:47] that the messenger told you to do
[1:22:55] everybody okay
[1:22:56] i'm going slowly amen
[1:22:59] which moses my servant commanded you
[1:23:03] turn not from me to the water or to the
[1:23:06] water in other words there is no room
[1:23:09] for deviation
[1:23:14] amen
[1:23:15] ever here
[1:23:17] so when you are a baby under a messenger
[1:23:20] i hope minister in the message
[1:23:22] understand this you must be careful how
[1:23:25] you are handling the words that has been
[1:23:28] handed to you
[1:23:32] because the law came from monsanto
[1:23:36] god came down and gave the law to moses
[1:23:40] and we saw under the unchanging pattern
[1:23:42] of god that the law came not only by god
[1:23:46] he came with angels
[1:23:48] do you remember
[1:23:49] do you remember that
[1:23:51] amen you don't remember anymore
[1:23:54] go to detroit 33.
[1:23:58] do it around on me 33.
[1:24:00] that's why you keep hearing me do you
[1:24:03] are you staying with the sermon
[1:24:07] let's go to deuteronomy uh deuteronomy
[1:24:10] 32 are you there
[1:24:16] 33
[1:24:18] verse 2. if you're there you can say
[1:24:19] amen
[1:24:22] you there
[1:24:24] pages are flipping
[1:24:26] there
[1:24:27] okay verse two and he said
[1:24:30] who came down
[1:24:32] the lord came down from what
[1:24:34] sana and rose up from sir to them
[1:24:38] he shunned forth from man's parent
[1:24:41] and he came with ten thousands of cents
[1:24:45] from his what
[1:24:47] so on mount sana
[1:24:50] this is the mountain
[1:24:52] the lord came down
[1:24:55] brother robert the lord himself
[1:24:58] shall come down
[1:25:00] everybody here
[1:25:02] when he came
[1:25:04] dimension about which hand
[1:25:08] the right hand
[1:25:11] what is in the right hand of god
[1:25:15] everybody okay
[1:25:17] everybody okay
[1:25:18] is it clicking do you see what i'm
[1:25:20] trying to say
[1:25:21] can you read between the line
[1:25:24] okay in his from his right hand went
[1:25:28] outward
[1:25:31] a fiery law
[1:25:33] so the law
[1:25:35] so when god came down in his right hand
[1:25:38] was what
[1:25:39] there was a law
[1:25:41] but the law was fiery
[1:25:44] because remember in the garden of eden
[1:25:47] the caribbean had a water
[1:25:50] a flaming sword
[1:25:52] about here
[1:25:53] because it's a judgment
[1:25:55] the penalty of sin is not paid yet
[1:25:59] but here so when the law came the law
[1:26:01] came with fury

[1:26:26] the law came the lord came
[1:26:28] when he came down in his right hand
[1:26:31] there is a law
[1:26:33] ever here we all been preaching to the
[1:26:36] people based on the movie
[1:26:39] that
[1:26:39] when
[1:26:40] moses went to the mountain god came and
[1:26:43] god was speaking to moses
[1:26:45] that's the way we grow up with the movie
[1:26:48] we thought he was god alone with moses
[1:26:52] but let's see what happened
[1:26:55] ever here when they say they say the
[1:26:57] lord came
[1:26:59] so you think it's god himself
[1:27:02] anybody here
[1:27:04] actor chapter 7
[1:27:06] verse 53 you're there you can say amen
[1:27:10] are you there

[1:27:14] i want you to see it acts 7 53
[1:27:17] i don't want you to say brother stephen
[1:27:19] saying
[1:27:21] are you there
[1:27:22] verse 53
[1:27:24] who has received the water
[1:27:26] the law by the disposition of water
[1:27:30] how many angels plural
[1:27:34] so
[1:27:35] when you take this
[1:27:37] in deuteronomy and you take act seven
[1:27:40] god was not alone
[1:27:46] everybody okay
[1:27:47] god came with angels
[1:27:50] [Music]
[1:27:53] everybody okay
[1:27:54] angels we have not kept anybody here so
[1:27:58] god with a host of angels
[1:28:04] came down on the mountain
[1:28:06] meet a prophet
[1:28:09] and give him the love from his right
[1:28:11] hand
[1:28:15] and in revelation 10
[1:28:19] [Music]
[1:28:21] we found the mighty angel came down
[1:28:23] christ
[1:28:24] with a little book
[1:28:26] but that book was no longer a fairy
[1:28:29] it was a book that was open because the
[1:28:33] lamb has paid the price he had broken
[1:28:36] the seals
[1:28:37] now he can come and give to john when
[1:28:40] john eat it it's not fairy it is sweet
[1:28:43] because the lamb played the person but
[1:28:45] if you look in revelation it only say
[1:28:48] one angel
[1:28:52] everybody okay but when the fulfillment
[1:28:55] happened
[1:28:56] on sunset mountain instead of one angel
[1:29:00] which was the one with uh with a chest
[1:29:02] like this which was crushed
[1:29:05] we found christ accompanied with angels
[1:29:09] this message
[1:29:11] is perfectly in line
[1:29:13] with the scripture
[1:29:15] everybody okay so when you are born
[1:29:17] under a messenger like that
[1:29:20] you need to be careful to keep the law
[1:29:23] and you cannot deviate from that message
[1:29:27] of the messenger to the right or to the

[1:31:39] way
[1:31:42] everybody okay so far babies and their
[1:31:45] ministry must remain faithful
[1:31:49] to what has been delivered to them
[1:31:52] everybody care
[1:31:53] roof under calvin
[1:31:56] now these four group we know
[1:31:59] luther produces the lutheran church
[1:32:01] calvin de calvinis west lady wesleyan
[1:32:04] armenian the armenians i mean armenians
[1:32:07] armenianism when brother branham came
[1:32:11] he looked through this and brother
[1:32:12] madame say all of them can be put in two
[1:32:15] categories
[1:32:16] and these two categories we know
[1:32:18] influences the ages up to today and the
[1:32:21] influences also marriages everybody
[1:32:23] clear so far
[1:32:25] now we already dealt with roof under
[1:32:27] luther we are dealing with roof under
[1:32:30] calvinism so you will understand what
[1:32:33] happened here
[1:32:35] what is going on
[1:32:37] as a reminder brother branham say that
[1:32:40] there is two great school of doctrine in
[1:32:42] church
[1:32:44] one of them is calvinism and the other
[1:32:47] armenianism
[1:32:48] one of them is water
[1:32:51] and the other is water so we are dealing
[1:32:53] with grace
[1:32:56] and legalism
[1:33:00] what kind of grace
[1:33:01] and work and the legalist
[1:33:04] there is a good legalist
[1:33:07] and there is a bad one
[1:33:09] you will see that on the roof serving
[1:33:11] everybody okay
[1:33:13] and we come to fund out of that that the
[1:33:17] people who believe in grace the
[1:33:20] calvinist
[1:33:21] the covenants they say
[1:33:23] bless god
[1:33:25] he don't hurt me to do whatever.
[1:33:31] everybody okay
[1:33:35] okay can i erase this
[1:33:39] i'm not calvinist
[1:33:43] anybody here under calvinist roof under
[1:33:47] calvinist
[1:33:48] and the calvinist which is grace
[1:33:53] anybody here
[1:33:55] they say that
[1:33:56] it doesn't hurt them to smoke
[1:34:01] everybody
[1:34:02] it's a christian
[1:34:06] with wrong habit
[1:34:11] anybody care
[1:34:14] he don't hurt me to drink
[1:34:17] i'm a christian but it doesn't hurt me
[1:34:20] i can do these things i got what
[1:34:24] so covenants preach
[1:34:26] strongly on eternal security
[1:34:30] in other words i am already
[1:34:35] saved i am already guaranteed
[1:34:40] no matter what happened in my life
[1:34:43] i will make it to heaven
[1:34:48] that is true
[1:34:50] but you must stay with what luther was
[1:34:53] saying
[1:34:57] anybody here
[1:34:58] a deviation from luther
[1:35:01] made somebody believe like because i am
[1:35:05] eternally secure
[1:35:07] no matter what i do god is doom
[1:35:13] roof
[1:35:14] under cover
[1:35:16] everybody here
[1:35:17] the legalistic side which i won't take
[1:35:20] today i would like to ball him out i
[1:35:23] would like to show him a piece of my
[1:35:25] mind but i'm a christian i have to keep
[1:35:27] it still let's go to that
[1:35:29] let's stay on the calvinism we will get
[1:35:32] that under armenianism everybody clear
[1:35:35] now we're dealing with calvin
[1:35:37] brother branham said baptist coming
[1:35:40] baptize a couple over here in immersing
[1:35:43] and the preacher baptized them
[1:35:45] nine out of what
[1:35:48] the people believed the lord
[1:35:50] they gave their hearts to the lord
[1:35:53] they say we are christian we believe on
[1:35:55] the lord jesus christ we're going to the
[1:35:58] present altar but after going to the
[1:36:00] present altar they take them to the
[1:36:02] level and they begin to baptize them
[1:36:05] when they baptize them
[1:36:07] they look 10 people were baptized but
[1:36:10] nine of them have a problem
[1:36:13] a roof under calvinist
[1:36:17] none of them do water
[1:36:20] smoke cigarettes
[1:36:23] go back out and stand out there and play
[1:36:26] card
[1:36:27] bunker all night
[1:36:29] run around and crooked business deal and
[1:36:32] all women wearing water
[1:36:35] running around in the street and bobbing
[1:36:37] their hair and smoking and talking and
[1:36:39] little seats and sew
[1:36:41] parties and telling what
[1:36:45] what is wrong
[1:36:47] this message
[1:36:49] anda luther came for justification
[1:36:52] to serve us
[1:36:54] we are baptized we should have seen a
[1:36:56] change in the life
[1:36:58] but for some reason the more the baptist
[1:37:01] the majority 99 percent 90 percent of
[1:37:05] the people baptized
[1:37:07] can't get away from wrong habit
[1:37:10] roof under calvinism
[1:37:14] everybody okay
[1:37:16] you caught that christianity
[1:37:19] and you think you got water
[1:37:22] the problem is the teaching
[1:37:25] of eternal security under heaven
[1:37:30] amen
[1:37:34] nail eternal security to the point that
[1:37:38] somebody can be doing everything that
[1:37:40] they were doing before under the
[1:37:43] practice that they already saved they
[1:37:44] will make it to heaven
[1:37:49] eternal security brother branham say
[1:37:53] you are going to hell
[1:37:56] with your eternal security
[1:38:02] brother stephen this is calvin
[1:38:05] we are in the message
[1:38:07] roof
[1:38:08] and the calvinism
[1:38:10] calvin said if you just believe the word
[1:38:15] that's saying
[1:38:17] as long as you believe the message
[1:38:20] that said and we found people in the
[1:38:23] message still with wrong habit
[1:38:27] preachers with round habits
[1:38:31] roof
[1:38:32] under calvinist
[1:38:35] 20 years in the message
[1:38:37] lying 20 years in the message
[1:38:40] problem 20 years preaching the message
[1:38:43] a big hypocrite
[1:38:46] roof under cabinet
[1:38:51] the seals are broken
[1:38:52] so you can see this arrow
[1:38:55] and you can deviate those errors and
[1:38:57] then keep the correct line
[1:39:02] everybody okay
[1:39:04] you would not enjoy yourself in heaven
[1:39:08] in any manner
[1:39:10] do you think you can go to heaven
[1:39:11] smoking cigarettes
[1:39:13] do you think you can go to heaven having
[1:39:15] that girlfriend or boyfriend of you of
[1:39:18] the world
[1:39:19] you believe in the message
[1:39:24] amen amen certainly not that is not
[1:39:29] eternal security but when a man is water
[1:39:34] the holiest
[1:39:35] the holiest
[1:39:37] what is good eternal security brother
[1:39:39] stephen
[1:39:40] roof and the calvinist
[1:39:43] the bible brother branham said i believe
[1:39:46] this
[1:39:47] in eternal security i believe the church
[1:39:50] has eternal security any readers of the
[1:39:53] bible knows that because god's already
[1:39:56] said it will appear younger without what
[1:39:59] there is already a promise
[1:40:01] no matter what happened i'm going to
[1:40:03] come out right that's okay
[1:40:06] that's right then it's going to be there
[1:40:08] the church is eternally water
[1:40:12] now are you in the church is the next
[1:40:15] thing
[1:40:18] brother branham is saying
[1:40:20] god has a church
[1:40:22] this is the church of god which is
[1:40:25] calling the scripture and by brother
[1:40:27] branham the bride of jesus christ if you
[1:40:29] need the scripture you save me
[1:40:32] you are here you're saying you are
[1:40:35] in the camp
[1:40:38] you're saying you are eternally security
[1:40:41] brother branham said i do believe that
[1:40:43] the eternal security one is the church
[1:40:50] can i start again
[1:40:52] this church
[1:40:53] is the body
[1:40:56] of jesus christ
[1:40:58] jesus himself is the head
[1:41:03] everybody that's why when the picture of
[1:41:06] the constellation was taken
[1:41:08] because he was crushed that came down he
[1:41:11] only appeared the head
[1:41:15] not the body
[1:41:18] everybody okay
[1:41:20] telling you that it is on me christ
[1:41:22] that's why brother branham said this is
[1:41:24] our lord right there look at his nose
[1:41:27] look at his beard look at his eyes
[1:41:30] because it's quest but not the body
[1:41:36] do you follow me
[1:41:38] christ is eternally secured
[1:41:42] the body of christ is eternally secured
[1:41:46] [Music]
[1:41:47] so if you want to be eternally secure
[1:41:50] you must be in this body
[1:41:57] your eternal security is not you
[1:42:00] it is somebody else
[1:42:02] so you must enter into that person
[1:42:05] and when you enter in that person you
[1:42:08] disappear
[1:42:09] and when they look at you
[1:42:12] they don't see you anymore they see
[1:42:14] eternal security
[1:42:16] eternal security eternal security
[1:42:20] eternal security eternal security
[1:42:23] because you are disappearing in christ
[1:42:28] [Applause]
[1:42:32] father help me
[1:42:34] i mean 30 percent
[1:42:37] lord help me
[1:42:40] i hope i can finish this it will help me
[1:42:41] on sunday
[1:42:42] everybody okay
[1:42:44] what is that brother pranama if you are
[1:42:47] in the church
[1:42:48] all right you are water
[1:42:51] with water
[1:42:52] in other words to call yourself security
[1:42:54] you gotta help in the church
[1:42:56] once you enter in the church you become
[1:42:58] secure
[1:42:59] not you the church makes you secure
[1:43:03] not the building
[1:43:04] but a body
[1:43:08] anybody care
[1:43:10] but you better water
[1:43:17] and how do you get in there
[1:43:20] that's
[1:43:21] that's where the problem is now
[1:43:23] brother stephen i want that eternal
[1:43:25] security
[1:43:26] how do you get it
[1:43:28] it's in the church
[1:43:29] in other words church is called eternal
[1:43:31] security if you enter there you pick up
[1:43:33] eternal security but how do you enter
[1:43:37] back here
[1:43:39] how do you get in the church by shaking
[1:43:41] hands
[1:43:42] putting your name in the book
[1:43:44] by what
[1:43:46] in other words only the baptism of the
[1:43:49] holy ghost
[1:43:52] will put you into the water
[1:43:57] eternal security is true
[1:43:59] but for you to be sure you are eternally
[1:44:03] secure you must enter the hundreds
[1:44:06] then it's finished
[1:44:10] but to enter the holiest you got to pass
[1:44:13] through the other court
[1:44:15] through the holy place and then the
[1:44:16] holiest the
[1:44:18] calvin thought
[1:44:20] he under he he didn't understand he was
[1:44:22] under luther
[1:44:25] he pushed so hard
[1:44:26] and convinced the people under luther
[1:44:30] that they are already in the holiest
[1:44:36] back here when they grab that revelation
[1:44:39] without the life
[1:44:42] without the experience
[1:44:45] [Music]
[1:44:46] you are trying to draw blood out of a
[1:44:49] turnip there is no blood
[1:44:52] what comes up is smoking
[1:44:54] cigarettes
[1:44:56] everything else
[1:44:59] false pretense
[1:45:01] rule from the calvinist
[1:45:03] hey but here
[1:45:05] and that body god judges cavalry was the
[1:45:09] body of who
[1:45:11] we are baptized into that body by what
[1:45:14] we have what as long as we are in the
[1:45:18] body of who
[1:45:19] nothing can water
[1:45:21] nothing can do what the devil even
[1:45:24] cannot touch you because you are sealed
[1:45:28] until the day of water
[1:45:30] redemption if you go out you go out by
[1:45:33] your own water
[1:45:35] but just that sure if you are in the
[1:45:37] body of christ as sure as christ rose
[1:45:40] from the dead you shall do what
[1:45:42] because if the same spirit
[1:45:46] that raised christ from the dead
[1:45:49] dwelleth in water
[1:45:51] then you have eternal security you shall
[1:45:54] quicken your mortal body by the spirit
[1:45:58] that dwelleth in you
[1:46:05] this message is yummy my friend
[1:46:08] ruth
[1:46:09] undercoverness
[1:46:12] calvinism
[1:46:13] cannot continue
[1:46:16] he preached eternal security no changes
[1:46:18] in the in the believer's life
[1:46:21] what else with kavanaugh
[1:46:23] don't go plumb too far over here on the
[1:46:27] calvinistic side
[1:46:28] once great water

[1:47:28] ghost that make a mistake but quickly
[1:47:31] the spirit brings you up and you
[1:47:33] continue eternally secure you don't
[1:47:36] enjoy the mistake

[1:48:34] but when i'm saying once again we come
[1:48:36] to a most difficult portion of the world
[1:48:40] this verse
[1:48:42] superficially regarded will be used by
[1:48:45] both water
[1:48:47] and water
[1:48:48] to do what
[1:48:50] to suit their purpose
[1:48:53] let me jump armenian
[1:48:55] i'm chained with calvin
[1:48:57] armenians make the will of the father
[1:49:00] not a sovereign will
[1:49:03] but merely a complacent desire as he
[1:49:06] stand back to see what all men do with
[1:49:09] his good and gracious gift and even life
[1:49:12] eternal
[1:49:13] the armenianists think that god
[1:49:16] doesn't have a sovereign decision
[1:49:21] they think that god
[1:49:23] put people in the world
[1:49:25] and begin to see how you react
[1:49:29] and when you do good
[1:49:30] god said i'm gonna save you
[1:49:33] when you do bad you are too bad you
[1:49:35] killed too many people you did this you
[1:49:37] did this you did this you are going to
[1:49:39] hell
[1:49:40] everybody here that's armenianism
[1:49:43] everybody okay
[1:49:44] but companies cling to the sovereignty
[1:49:47] of god they love the sovereignty of god
[1:49:51] because one save
[1:49:53] our savior
[1:49:58] everybody okay
[1:49:59] the companies do not see that
[1:50:02] they say in this verse strong word
[1:50:06] given to the water
[1:50:08] burden sent that no matter how evil at
[1:50:10] the time how terrible the persecution
[1:50:13] because the overcomer is the one who
[1:50:16] does what
[1:50:20] have you received the holy ghost since
[1:50:22] you
[1:50:24] to them looter belief justification is
[1:50:28] enough no bloating from the book of life
[1:50:30] ever here believe that jesus is the
[1:50:33] christ he will not have his name what
[1:50:37] because i believed i went to the present
[1:50:39] altar i cannot have my name
[1:50:42] judah also believed
[1:50:46] the bible said that the devil believes
[1:50:50] but judah's name was removed from the
[1:50:53] book of life
[1:50:54] calvin missed that
[1:50:58] once you went to the altar god will
[1:51:00] never remove you from the book of life
[1:51:01] that's it no matter what i do i'm going
[1:51:04] to stay in the book of life
[1:51:08] correction
[1:51:09] i believe that god knew before the
[1:51:12] foundation of the world chose his church
[1:51:15] in christ and slay christ before the
[1:51:17] foundation of the world
[1:51:19] scriptures say he was the lamb of god
[1:51:22] slain from the foundation of the world
[1:51:24] and jesus said that he knew us
[1:51:28] before the water
[1:51:30] we believed that
[1:51:31] he knew us and predestined us unto
[1:51:35] adoption of the children by water
[1:51:38] before the world ever worked
[1:51:40] that is good
[1:51:42] our
[1:51:43] so don't worry
[1:51:46] the will are turning just right
[1:51:49] everything coming just in time the only
[1:51:52] thing is getting the water
[1:51:54] and that's the good part about it then
[1:51:57] you know how they work hard to work when
[1:51:59] you get in the water as soon as you
[1:52:02] engage correctly that said god take over
[1:52:11] roof and the calvinism ever here
[1:52:14] the problem with kevin
[1:52:17] kevin
[1:52:18] missed something
[1:52:22] that's why he went in the deep end
[1:52:24] what did calvin missed
[1:52:27] number one
[1:52:29] everybody here
[1:52:30] brother madam say we believe in
[1:52:32] justification by faith romans 5 11 we
[1:52:36] believe that a per that after a person
[1:52:39] being justified by what
[1:52:42] he completed the other court he has
[1:52:44] peace with the lord jesus his
[1:52:46] disposition chain
[1:52:48] but it is possible
[1:52:50] that the same person could have water
[1:52:54] such as water
[1:52:59] drinking
[1:53:00] smoking doing things that he should not
[1:53:03] do filthy habit of the water that's what
[1:53:06] calvin missed
[1:53:11] that's why when they were baptizing the
[1:53:14] people
[1:53:15] nine
[1:53:16] out of ten
[1:53:18] continue with wrong habit
[1:53:20] and craft and came and strengthened them
[1:53:23] that you have eternal security if you
[1:53:25] only believed
[1:53:29] everybody okay
[1:53:31] what else sixty foul brother branham say
[1:53:34] here is the human heart you know that
[1:53:36] right and here is the human heart too
[1:53:39] hard this one over here has a dove in it
[1:53:42] no let me start here now this one over
[1:53:44] here he has a water
[1:53:49] justify
[1:53:50] wrong habit
[1:53:52] first key
[1:53:53] where is the source of this wrong habit
[1:53:56] the source of the wrong habit is what
[1:53:59] snake
[1:54:00] calvin didn't understand this
[1:54:02] if you look at this quote he's after the
[1:54:04] opening of the seals
[1:54:08] you see that
[1:54:09] he said this one over here have snacking
[1:54:12] that is what
[1:54:14] snake is speaking of sin
[1:54:18] this one over here has a dove in it
[1:54:21] which is the holy spirit
[1:54:23] here he has a life well this one here
[1:54:26] everybody here he has water
[1:54:30] malice is here
[1:54:33] and what
[1:54:34] hatred is here and water
[1:54:37] envy
[1:54:38] what is causing it is this fellow here
[1:54:41] the snake
[1:54:43] nandy when you are asked
[1:54:45] oh you are forgiven of your sin you have
[1:54:48] only done this
[1:54:49] take away
[1:54:50] but the thing that made you do it all
[1:54:53] your passing are completely gone but the
[1:54:56] thing that makes you do it that all the
[1:54:59] root of what
[1:55:00] that snake
[1:55:02] that all the root of evil
[1:55:06] it's still there calvin didn't
[1:55:09] understand that anybody care
[1:55:12] notice then when you repent and are
[1:55:14] baptized in the name of jesus christ
[1:55:16] that he forgive you your sins
[1:55:19] but the snake is there
[1:55:22] everybody here
[1:55:23] brother branham say why didn't desire
[1:55:26] the man wesley luther and those great
[1:55:29] reformers who brought that justification
[1:55:31] sanctification the pentecostal age
[1:55:34] all three reformers with the baptism of
[1:55:37] the holy ghost and things why didn't
[1:55:39] they catch these messages why did indeed
[1:55:42] see this
[1:55:43] everybody here why didn't they get them
[1:55:46] because they were water
[1:55:48] this
[1:55:49] the reason that all destroying ends of
[1:55:53] the mysterious part of water
[1:55:56] the mysterious part of water and the
[1:55:58] mysterious part of water
[1:56:00] so when lute plateau
[1:56:03] he left out the mysterious part
[1:56:10] here in other words the bread came from
[1:56:14] god
[1:56:14] and luther began to eat the bread
[1:56:17] as lute was eating the bread he was
[1:56:20] eating the bread as a child
[1:56:24] and when child our children are eating
[1:56:27] rice they are left over that are falling
[1:56:30] off
[1:56:34] there are crumbs
[1:56:36] that are coming down
[1:56:38] and west now continued to eat and the
[1:56:40] crumbs came down
[1:56:42] but we the gentler we are dogs
[1:56:49] yes my father i am a dog
[1:56:52] i don't deserve the gentle table
[1:56:55] i'm after the crumbs
[1:56:58] i'm after the thunders
[1:57:00] the loose end
[1:57:02] they lost mysteries
[1:57:04] the last truth
[1:57:06] that's what i missed
[1:57:08] jesus turned around say woman
[1:57:11] it's already gone
[1:57:13] you touch the standard
[1:57:15] you touch the revelation of the thunder
[1:57:18] the loose end of luther they lose end of
[1:57:21] wesley they lose end of pentacles the
[1:57:24] constellation of seven engines bring
[1:57:27] everything together
[1:57:28] that's what we need
[1:57:30] for the redemption
[1:57:42] [Music]
[1:57:45] can you give me grace
[1:57:48] can you give me grace
[1:57:50] hallelujah blessed be the name of the
[1:57:53] lord
[1:57:54] that's the cause
[1:57:55] that's why calvin
[1:57:57] could not make it
[1:57:58] he could not take the people over there
[1:58:01] they lose him
[1:58:02] he was not your age
[1:58:04] it's unfulfilled everybody
[1:58:06] ever care
[1:58:08] cousin
[1:58:12] ruth undercovers
[1:58:14] christian with wrong habit
[1:58:16] eternal security thought wrong outside
[1:58:19] of the holy ghost
[1:58:21] once grace always grace leading to
[1:58:23] disgrace
[1:58:24] book of life save never to be blowed out
[1:58:28] lead to disgrace
[1:58:29] roof under calvin
[1:58:32] this is fine sardisian churches calvin
[1:58:36] these fun teachers of great importance
[1:58:41] but also the invention of what became
[1:58:44] the basis of our modern printing princes
[1:58:47] our process was discovered facilitating
[1:58:50] the production of water
[1:58:52] when the age of luther came
[1:58:55] something happened in humanity
[1:58:59] i hope you're gonna catch it
[1:59:01] they invented
[1:59:03] the printing machine
[1:59:07] under
[1:59:08] loop
[1:59:09] but the robot is there
[1:59:13] everybody here and kevin pick it up
[1:59:17] and the message begin to go
[1:59:19] under books
[1:59:23] are you following me
[1:59:25] the message that luther was preaching on
[1:59:28] the pulpit
[1:59:29] the bible
[1:59:31] that they were talking about could go
[1:59:33] under prison
[1:59:36] it's a stage
[1:59:37] of calvinism
[1:59:45] it's the message in the infancy
[1:59:48] because the messenger is gone
[1:59:50] moses is taken off
[1:59:52] the prince begin to go
[1:59:54] the print begin to go
[1:59:56] the people in the message missed that
[2:00:00] they didn't know the devil was moving on
[2:00:06] ruth and the calvinism
[2:00:10] ever here the printing machine begin to
[2:00:12] go
[2:00:14] everybody here
[2:00:15] everybody here
[2:00:17] production of water
[2:00:20] all over
[2:00:22] because the messenger is gone everybody
[2:00:24] here that's we found the great hunger
[2:00:27] and demand for the water
[2:00:30] the people
[2:00:32] you gotta the books people who come even
[2:00:35] copy
[2:00:41] i hope you're getting that
[2:00:43] god raised up many many men
[2:00:46] of which luther was but what
[2:00:49] the messenger began to have babies yes
[2:00:54] kevin zwingli where the two other
[2:00:56] luminous besides days were many so after
[2:01:00] luther
[2:01:01] does that came and followed luther
[2:01:04] some begin to pick up a higher level
[2:01:08] when the books are going
[2:01:12] roof
[2:01:13] and
[2:01:14] cavern
[2:01:16] anybody okay
[2:01:18] many more who are not so well known all
[2:01:22] over the world however though all this
[2:01:25] was not water the work of calvin was not
[2:01:28] in vain
[2:01:33] where are you going brother stephen
[2:01:35] relax
[2:01:37] was nothing then why is he not even he
[2:01:39] causes a mess
[2:01:41] why is he not in vain
[2:01:43] everybody here do nothing then
[2:01:46] the mighty work of god was actually
[2:01:49] water by water
[2:01:51] demand arose under the printing machine
[2:01:55] the printing of books
[2:01:58] their work was very good
[2:02:00] but their message that was delivered was
[2:02:04] also hindered by those men
[2:02:14] don't worry my friend
[2:02:15] roof on the confidence my friend on the
[2:02:18] internet
[2:02:20] this is tough i'm preaching to this
[2:02:21] church
[2:02:22] anybody here
[2:02:23] it was if there was ever a time of what
[2:02:28] did not miss the denomination of what
[2:02:31] it was
[2:02:32] at the tragic time
[2:02:34] so the time of lutheran covenant
[2:02:38] was the time of
[2:02:40] denominational zeal
[2:02:45] the zeal is there
[2:02:47] but not for god
[2:02:50] the zeal that came
[2:02:52] was to build
[2:02:55] kingdoms
[2:02:58] to build moves
[2:03:02] they forgot the messenger gave the
[2:03:04] message
[2:03:06] they were going with the books but
[2:03:08] they're moving up they're going over
[2:03:09] here pulling bulletin but they are
[2:03:12] building kingdoms
[2:03:17] roof
[2:03:18] under calvinist
[2:03:20] brother branham was not telling you this
[2:03:22] thing for history
[2:03:25] it was a
[2:03:26] purpose amen
[2:03:29] communious
[2:03:31] wrote
[2:03:32] the word of communion described somebody
[2:03:35] called communion begin to explain the
[2:03:37] time of calvin
[2:03:38] what really was it
[2:03:40] he says
[2:03:41] wrote that one thing needful
[2:03:44] he compared the world in the time of
[2:03:46] calvin to the labyrinth you know the
[2:03:49] labyrinth right
[2:03:51] okay castle
[2:03:53] and show that the way out is by living
[2:03:57] what is needless and choosing the one
[2:03:59] thing need for which is what
[2:04:02] this man watch what happened
[2:04:04] during the time of covenant
[2:04:07] he said
[2:04:08] they're very there is only one thing
[2:04:10] that is necessary that is who
[2:04:13] christ
[2:04:14] which is the word of the hour
[2:04:16] but what i'm looking here is something
[2:04:18] else
[2:04:21] everybody here
[2:04:22] the great numbers of water
[2:04:25] under the books
[2:04:28] every year
[2:04:29] he says is the reason of multitude of
[2:04:32] water
[2:04:34] so the preaching of the message begin to
[2:04:38] divide the bride
[2:04:42] roof
[2:04:43] and the cavern
[2:04:46] it looks like they are moving for the
[2:04:48] messenger but as they're going out
[2:04:51] pulling books and moving out to spread
[2:04:54] the message they're actually cutting off
[2:04:56] the bride
[2:04:58] [Music]
[2:05:00] roof
[2:05:01] under luther under calvinist
[2:05:04] anybody here for which we will soon have
[2:05:08] no name left
[2:05:10] each church record itself as the water
[2:05:14] our at least the water
[2:05:17] the what truest part of it while among
[2:05:20] themselves they do what
[2:05:22] each other with the water
[2:05:25] everybody they have the right doctrine
[2:05:28] those are wrong
[2:05:29] our church is right those are wrong and
[2:05:32] it becomes fight on the pulpit
[2:05:35] [Music]
[2:05:37] among the minister
[2:05:41] when the printing books are going out
[2:05:44] at the infancy of the message
[2:05:47] the message was going out but we found
[2:05:50] that minister began to have trouble
[2:05:54] with other churches fighting
[2:05:58] he was roof
[2:05:59] and calvinist
[2:06:02] because kevin
[2:06:03] miss
[2:06:05] the
[2:06:06] advice of a baby born under a messenger
[2:06:12] when you a baby born and the messenger
[2:06:14] you must stay with the message don't
[2:06:17] deviate with it
[2:06:22] the one who went
[2:06:23] begin to spread it
[2:06:25] but
[2:06:26] the result is
[2:06:28] division you from that church we don't
[2:06:31] talk to you
[2:06:35] everybody okay
[2:06:38] anybody okay
[2:06:40] no
[2:06:40] reconciliation is to be hope between
[2:06:43] water
[2:06:44] under the same messenger
[2:06:46] beat their nest
[2:06:48] this minister don't talk to medicine
[2:06:50] minister
[2:06:52] they meet enmity with water
[2:06:55] they won't get along yet both of them
[2:06:59] are preaching the same message
[2:07:00] [Music]
[2:07:02] and the people under the church will
[2:07:05] pick up the spirit and don't talk to the
[2:07:07] people and the united churches
[2:07:10] [Music]
[2:07:16] he begin to create clicks
[2:07:20] everybody okay
[2:07:22] out of the bible they do what
[2:07:25] different water they have one bubble
[2:07:28] but when they come out they are forging
[2:07:31] doctrine from the same message
[2:07:35] here
[2:07:36] these are their water
[2:07:39] fortress and water bow works behind
[2:07:42] which they enchant themselves and resist
[2:07:45] our water
[2:07:46] we believe this with this move in the
[2:07:49] message and we got our weapon the other
[2:07:52] one believed this and they got their
[2:07:54] weapon now we got the return ministry
[2:07:56] the thunder's here this one here this
[2:07:59] one here this one here they forgot the
[2:08:02] purpose
[2:08:08] and the cabinets
[2:08:12] i'm preaching that so you who are still
[2:08:14] hooked to that need to come out
[2:08:19] everybody here
[2:08:21] i will not say that this confession of
[2:08:23] faith for we can admit in most cases
[2:08:26] that they are bad in themselves
[2:08:29] can i continue
[2:08:31] give me grace my friend everybody
[2:08:34] they become so however in that defeat
[2:08:38] the fire of water
[2:08:40] to this labyrinth of sex
[2:08:44] and various water
[2:08:46] one message too many tendencies
[2:08:52] the messenger didn't come with all of
[2:08:54] that
[2:08:55] he only preached one message but the
[2:08:57] babies that was born that pick up the
[2:09:00] message begin to create sex
[2:09:04] everybody here
[2:09:05] the love of water
[2:09:09] it becomes the message became for
[2:09:11] argument
[2:09:13] we are studying the message
[2:09:15] to lord ourself
[2:09:17] to meet one another and to start war
[2:09:20] cut coat cut coat cut
[2:09:23] cut coat
[2:09:26] they forgot the needful thing
[2:09:28] he was not said for that
[2:09:31] here
[2:09:32] what is attained by it
[2:09:34] has a single life of what
[2:09:37] ever been said
[2:09:40] political reconciliation
[2:09:43] brother i'm sorry for everything we
[2:09:45] preach on the pulpit tomorrow they come
[2:09:47] back again
[2:09:49] and they start again after they
[2:09:51] reconcile
[2:09:54] and they send a letter to all the
[2:09:55] churches
[2:09:56] to show that now we need good friendship
[2:09:59] political everybody here
[2:10:02] back here
[2:10:04] their number has only increased in
[2:10:06] divine services
[2:10:08] the word of god
[2:10:12] the word of preachers
[2:10:15] are usually heard more than the water
[2:10:21] my pastor said this in our church my
[2:10:24] pastor says this my pastor says this
[2:10:28] hardly you can give somebody the cut he
[2:10:31] will reject the court and he will cling
[2:10:34] to what his pastor say

[2:10:55] good i go with his ministry and the
[2:10:58] bride of jesus christ became divided
[2:11:02] the one with peter said we have the
[2:11:05] miracle we have mark 16. the one with
[2:11:09] apollo said you guys don't have the word
[2:11:11] when you receive the word you receive
[2:11:13] the holy ghost
[2:11:19] some say i'm not gonna get on that me
[2:11:21] i'm
[2:11:22] forecast the other one said no we it's
[2:11:26] by the branham
[2:11:28] it's power
[2:11:31] roof under heaviness
[2:11:35] everybody here
[2:11:36] the word or each one shadow as he
[2:11:40] pleases or kill time by learning water
[2:11:45] and disproving water
[2:11:48] instead of preaching the message they
[2:11:51] will prepare a sermon
[2:11:53] to destroy another doctrine
[2:11:57] when they come they're preaching to
[2:11:59] destroy the other doctrine they are the
[2:12:01] one goes and study and comes back to
[2:12:04] react back to the one who sent it
[2:12:07] roof and the calvinism
[2:12:10] amen
[2:12:12] everybody here
[2:12:14] the new birth and how a man must be
[2:12:17] changed is in into the likeness of
[2:12:19] christ has become the part the partaker
[2:12:22] of divine nature scarcely anything is
[2:12:25] water
[2:12:26] the believers that came into the message
[2:12:30] they were expecting to receive the
[2:12:32] message to grow now instead of receiving
[2:12:34] the message they are receiving the
[2:12:36] fighting that is going on in the message
[2:12:40] they don't tell them how to grow they
[2:12:42] don't tell them how to receive the holy
[2:12:44] ghost they know more about the fighting
[2:12:47] and the doctrine and this brother is
[2:12:49] wrong this brother is wrong this body is
[2:12:52] wrong and they found themselves the
[2:12:54] habit never left them
[2:12:56] 20 years in the message bad habit
[2:12:59] 20 years in a message bad habit because
[2:13:02] of confidence
[2:13:06] hallelujah
[2:13:08] scarcely of the power and the key the
[2:13:11] church has almost lost the power of
[2:13:13] burning only the power of losing the
[2:13:16] sacrament giving us a symbol of water
[2:13:19] i want you to speak one mind
[2:13:21] and love and our life of christ has been
[2:13:23] made an occasion of water
[2:13:25] beadiness and water
[2:13:27] and water
[2:13:30] look at the sound of the snake
[2:13:34] you see
[2:13:34] the sound of the snake
[2:13:36] the snake was already sitting there and
[2:13:39] the devil said let me shoot that weapon
[2:13:41] again
[2:13:42] i'm gonna get them amen
[2:13:45] the faith has been split into a thousand
[2:13:48] water
[2:13:49] leader part and you are made a heretic
[2:13:52] if there is one of them that do not
[2:13:54] matter
[2:13:55] you don't accept our doctrine you a
[2:13:57] devil
[2:13:58] you're gonna go to hell you must believe
[2:14:00] this way
[2:14:03] roof
[2:14:04] and the legalist
[2:14:06] anybody here
[2:14:07] hey but here
[2:14:09] now i just said that this era brother
[2:14:11] branham gave tremendous growth to the
[2:14:14] denomination of water
[2:14:16] we built move in the message under men
[2:14:19] this one have preachers behind him this
[2:14:22] one have a group of preachers under and
[2:14:24] the countries are divided with big
[2:14:26] pictures
[2:14:27] you go to this country you find like
[2:14:29] four preachers they control the entire
[2:14:31] country you go to another country you
[2:14:33] find three preachers they control the
[2:14:36] and now the younger ministers that are
[2:14:38] growing up they think like before they
[2:14:41] can have a ministry they have to be to a
[2:14:43] clique
[2:14:45] come out of those clique
[2:14:49] you don't need a clique
[2:14:51] you can stand yourself with the world
[2:14:58] what i'm saying if you were under a camp
[2:15:01] in this message come out of the camp
[2:15:04] [Applause]
[2:15:05] return back to the original
[2:15:12] roof and the calvinist
[2:15:15] have you
[2:15:16] there is a convention a certain trick
[2:15:18] will go in that convention the other one
[2:15:20] won't go another convention there
[2:15:23] somehow they will go over there those
[2:15:25] are the one go the message has been kept
[2:15:28] parted and clicks and you will see
[2:15:30] clicks here and clicks here and clicks
[2:15:32] here and clicks here and this one follow
[2:15:34] this click and this one follow this
[2:15:35] click and the believers are in war
[2:15:40] roof under carvings
[2:15:43] everybody here
[2:15:45] if the spirit attitude of what
[2:15:48] i am of four i am of what
[2:15:50] was ever exhibited it was water
[2:15:53] why such fragmentation of the body was
[2:15:57] deplorable they were leaving a name but
[2:16:00] they were water they built move
[2:16:04] and once that preacher dead what else
[2:16:06] can you do
[2:16:07] now we begin to search for his son to
[2:16:09] take over and continue the move
[2:16:11] he become a succession
[2:16:17] i'm preaching to this church
[2:16:20] i'm preaching to this church
[2:16:22] we need to be free
[2:16:24] somebody asked me i say me
[2:16:26] you will search me for a long time
[2:16:28] you're not gonna find me in any clique
[2:16:31] i'm gonna stand into denomination
[2:16:35] i don't belong to any clique
[2:16:37] i will shake hand with this brother this
[2:16:40] brother this brother but i won't belong
[2:16:43] to your cliques
[2:16:44] i stick with the message
[2:16:49] if you want to chase me away that's fine
[2:16:51] but i will not bow down to any clique in
[2:16:54] the message
[2:16:59] what is the result looted through poor
[2:17:02] judgment incited to battle and thereby
[2:17:05] caused the death of mounted
[2:17:08] but zwingli party persecuted unto the
[2:17:10] prison the godly doctor uh hapmayer
[2:17:14] hope meyer
[2:17:16] and calvin did no less for he demanded
[2:17:19] to arrest who
[2:17:21] servatus who had seen and taught the
[2:17:23] water
[2:17:24] somebody got a revelation of the oneness
[2:17:27] of god because he's not under cover
[2:17:30] calvin do maneuver to destroy him
[2:17:34] somebody comes and begin to preach
[2:17:36] things from the message that you don't
[2:17:38] preach before you know it you call the
[2:17:41] pax to attack him
[2:17:43] because he doesn't belong to your clique
[2:17:46] he should remember and recognize us that
[2:17:48] we the elders
[2:17:52] paul say i confer to no blood and to
[2:17:56] know flesh i learned i made mistake by
[2:17:58] this kind of stuff everybody here he the
[2:18:01] state then tried his brother and
[2:18:03] cavendish
[2:18:05] and to calvin dismay he was burned at
[2:18:07] the stake
[2:18:09] now you say kevin believed something
[2:18:11] like that i didn't believe calvin kevin
[2:18:13] was a what
[2:18:15] kavan put a man to death because he
[2:18:17] baptized in water
[2:18:19] he was a rascal needed to be converted
[2:18:22] himself yes sir
[2:18:25] he's such an amen that killed a man for
[2:18:28] something like that that's horrible that
[2:18:30] is water
[2:18:32] because they don't belong to you
[2:18:35] i'm going to destroy them
[2:18:36] brother stephen we never kill somebody
[2:18:39] and never take somebody to the stake you
[2:18:42] people with these sublet temples that's
[2:18:44] always padding off into the mouth at
[2:18:46] somebody can't put up things like that
[2:18:49] be careful you are guilty if you speak a
[2:18:52] word against your brother that is not
[2:18:54] right
[2:18:55] not just go around and tear it down you
[2:18:57] don't have to stick a water
[2:18:59] a knife in the man's back to kill him
[2:19:02] you can break his water
[2:19:04] and do what
[2:19:05] kill his water speak against your pastor
[2:19:08] here say something bad about him you
[2:19:11] just might as well as do what
[2:19:15] [Music]
[2:19:18] the cliques will pack they will take a
[2:19:20] story
[2:19:21] they don't even have time to call the
[2:19:23] brother they say brother we heard the
[2:19:25] story about you is that true no they
[2:19:28] cling with the pack this one brought the
[2:19:30] story so the story is true and the whole
[2:19:32] click reject you
[2:19:34] you didn't do anything nobody even came
[2:19:36] to ask you
[2:19:38] because you don't belong to them because
[2:19:40] they already have relationship built for
[2:19:42] years you are a new one
[2:19:45] they can destroy you they can destroy
[2:19:48] your influence they can say all kinds of
[2:19:51] stuff he believed polygamy
[2:19:55] calvinist
[2:19:56] [Music]
[2:19:58] you might as well shot him taught
[2:20:01] something that was not right about him
[2:20:03] he said kill his influence with the
[2:20:05] people and things like that you are
[2:20:07] guilty of it
[2:20:09] lose under confidence they hated him
[2:20:13] because they were jealous of him
[2:20:15] that is the only reason they were
[2:20:17] jealous they were trying to destroy his
[2:20:19] influence before the people the same as
[2:20:22] they are doing now if destroyed the
[2:20:25] influence of the message before the
[2:20:27] people then you got the think water
[2:20:34] the devil got in
[2:20:36] and destroyed amen
[2:20:38] because why did they try to do it
[2:20:40] because they were against all their
[2:20:41] creeds and all their church doctrine and
[2:20:44] everything that they believe in
[2:20:48] when you preach you begin to destroy
[2:20:50] them they pack again against you
[2:20:52] roof under legalism
[2:20:55] under calvinist
[2:20:58] what about i'm saying
[2:21:08] yeah i gotta stop let's go to philippian
[2:21:10] one
[2:21:11] roof
[2:21:14] under calvinist
[2:21:18] so when you read the church ages don't
[2:21:19] think you're reading stories
[2:21:22] the prophet is unfolding
[2:21:24] things that the bride should be aware
[2:21:27] and alert
[2:21:29] because the devil was coming with those
[2:21:31] weapon again
[2:21:34] and the bride missing
[2:21:37] everybody here
[2:21:40] let's go to philippians one verse six
[2:21:42] you there
[2:21:45] verse six being confidence
[2:21:47] of these very things
[2:21:50] brother charles that he which has began
[2:21:53] what
[2:21:54] a good work on you will perform it until
[2:21:57] the day of who
[2:21:59] jesus christ you ready
[2:22:01] job from verse 15.
[2:22:03] buckle up because i'm searching the
[2:22:05] airport
[2:22:06] you there
[2:22:07] you there on verse 15
[2:22:09] some
[2:22:10] indeed preach what
[2:22:12] the message of the hour even of water
[2:22:16] and what
[2:22:18] look at the snake here
[2:22:22] preacher on the pulpit
[2:22:24] under justification
[2:22:26] did not understand that gift and calling
[2:22:30] were without repentance
[2:22:32] they trained them under a click
[2:22:36] and everybody want to build a kingdom
[2:22:39] ever here the preaching christ
[2:22:42] but the motive the heart from where the
[2:22:45] message is preached
[2:22:47] is a heart with envy and stuff
[2:22:51] they have a battling spirit
[2:22:54] combative spirit on the pulpit
[2:23:02] and some also of what
[2:23:05] some are preaching christ with a good
[2:23:07] heart
[2:23:09] so there is two kind of preaching that
[2:23:10] went out
[2:23:11] everybody here
[2:23:13] verse 16 the one preach christ of water
[2:23:17] let's see in the board here paul say
[2:23:20] what i found about you
[2:23:23] the gospel is preached for contention
[2:23:27] under calvinism
[2:23:29] the message is preached but the the
[2:23:32] the the zero
[2:23:34] the motive is contention is to debate is
[2:23:37] to disprove
[2:23:39] is to break somebody is to establish the
[2:23:42] owner
[2:23:43] roof under calvinist
[2:23:47] the contention not water
[2:23:50] that's why you don't see the product
[2:23:53] no holy ghost because god will not
[2:23:55] sanction that and the lord has been
[2:23:57] quiet and living people fighting
[2:24:00] fighting father and after 20 years you
[2:24:01] say how long did you believe the message
[2:24:03] 20 years and the acting like a devil
[2:24:07] because the holy ghost was blocked
[2:24:10] because of the way the sermon were
[2:24:12] preached was under a wrong motive
[2:24:15] ever here
[2:24:17] verse 16 the one preached christ of
[2:24:19] contention not sincerely supposing to
[2:24:22] add water
[2:24:24] to my water
[2:24:25] where is brother branham when he look he
[2:24:27] said is that what i left you
[2:24:32] everybody here
[2:24:34] verse 17 but
[2:24:36] the other of what
[2:24:38] knowing that i am set for the defense of
[2:24:42] the gospel everybody here
[2:24:46] watch verse 18
[2:24:47] brother steven they did a mess they
[2:24:50] preached the message like that
[2:24:52] brother branham say even the message of
[2:24:55] calvin were not in vain
[2:24:57] [Music]
[2:24:59] where did brother branham get that
[2:25:01] watch verse 18 paul say some of you are
[2:25:04] preaching the message wrong some are
[2:25:06] preaching that good
[2:25:07] but even the one that preached wrong
[2:25:10] let's see what he says verse 18 what
[2:25:13] then notwithstanding every way
[2:25:17] were there in water
[2:25:19] they were preaching the message in
[2:25:20] pretense
[2:25:23] because they know if they say they don't
[2:25:25] believe the message they will be cut off
[2:25:26] from the benefit
[2:25:28] the tithing will go the church will go
[2:25:31] everything will go so we must keep the
[2:25:33] message for pretense because that is our
[2:25:35] source of income
[2:25:37] that is where we can we have
[2:25:39] if we show our colors the brothers will
[2:25:42] cut us off
[2:25:43] so let me keep up hypocrites
[2:25:46] everybody here
[2:25:47] but whether in princess or in
[2:25:51] christ is what
[2:25:53] and i dare you to do what
[2:25:56] and we want her
[2:25:58] even though he looks bad
[2:26:00] but at least the message was spread
[2:26:04] now god is coming down and picking up
[2:26:07] his elect like paul and begin to unfold
[2:26:10] themselves the word
[2:26:11] and they let now begin to look and say
[2:26:14] now understand the message
[2:26:16] i'm not gonna be behind anymore preacher
[2:26:19] i'm not gonna be behind anymore move i'm
[2:26:21] not gonna be behind the clique i'm gonna
[2:26:24] be separated
[2:26:25] let me stay with my quest
[2:26:28] that's what paul said now his son is
[2:26:31] revealed on me i am free from man
[2:26:34] everything that i accounted that was a
[2:26:36] blessing paul say i look at them as done
[2:26:40] your friendship is done because in our
[2:26:43] friendship we were gossiping about the
[2:26:45] other brothers
[2:26:49] but now trust have revealed himself to
[2:26:52] me i understood the arrow
[2:26:54] i'm gonna stick with the message
[2:26:57] yeah you can continue with your move
[2:26:59] you can continue with your your big name
[2:27:02] you can continue with your popularity no
[2:27:05] i was behind man i'm so disappointed
[2:27:07] with this one this one
[2:27:09] i'm shocked let me stay with the message
[2:27:12] the message is pure
[2:27:14] this is where you are now
[2:27:16] come out of your calvinism come out of
[2:27:19] your preachers in the message come out
[2:27:22] of your favorite preacher come out of
[2:27:24] your favorite churches come out of your
[2:27:27] favorite moves
[2:27:28] go back to the message
[2:27:31] stay with the message
[2:27:33] don't deviate left and right
[2:27:35] stay with what brother branham gave
[2:27:50] i'm the calvinist
[2:28:00] it's a shame
[2:28:06] until somebody can move from one state
[2:28:09] to another
[2:28:10] or from one country to another and they
[2:28:13] have a hard time choosing a church
[2:28:16] because their favorite movies left from
[2:28:18] the country where they came
[2:28:20] from the state that they came they
[2:28:22] rather stay online
[2:28:24] and sending paths over there
[2:28:26] and breaking the law of brother branham
[2:28:29] which say you must have a local church
[2:28:32] roof on the company they got so caught
[2:28:35] up with the preacher
[2:28:39] we love the farfo ministry we will
[2:28:41] continue to bring them here you can
[2:28:43] enjoy a brother on youtube you can enjoy
[2:28:45] about it but stay with christ
[2:28:50] because if that brother deviate
[2:28:54] you can stick with the word
[2:28:56] and don't deviate not he deviate you
[2:28:58] deviate
[2:29:00] he's against the pastor you against the
[2:29:01] pastor
[2:29:03] he argue you are you
[2:29:05] he assault people you insult people you
[2:29:08] are under calvinistic
[2:29:11] he insult people you should have enough
[2:29:13] god to say that he is a good man but
[2:29:15] what he did there is wrong
[2:29:19] peter is a good man but peter what
[2:29:21] you're doing he's a hypocrite
[2:29:23] paul taught peter but peter was the one
[2:29:26] that started with jesus christ peter was
[2:29:28] the one that have the revelation peter
[2:29:30] was the one that walked on the water
[2:29:32] peter was the one that entered into the
[2:29:34] tomb but when peter is wrong paul have
[2:29:37] enough god to stand that peter this
[2:29:40] place you did wrong how can you be a
[2:29:42] brother and you're doing this in front
[2:29:44] of these hidden
[2:29:46] what example are you giving them
[2:29:49] but he didn't disfellowship peter he
[2:29:52] continued to love peter but he was no
[2:29:54] more under that
[2:29:56] anointing of men
[2:29:58] of following man
[2:30:01] because paul got one day in trouble
[2:30:03] and they pick him up and paul looked at
[2:30:05] the audience he said these are pharisees
[2:30:07] these are sadducees and paul came he
[2:30:09] said i'm a pharisee do you know what
[2:30:11] happened
[2:30:12] do you know what happened
[2:30:13] you know what happened
[2:30:15] when the guys understood that hey he
[2:30:18] believe adoption
[2:30:20] paul is no more bad
[2:30:23] they're taking part
[2:30:25] no paul didn't do anything wrong
[2:30:28] they would they were a gaspar
[2:30:30] until paul say i belongs to your clique
[2:30:38] you see what i'm saying
[2:30:40] as long as when you belongs to a click
[2:30:42] or your badge issue they wipe it
[2:30:45] now you become a good brother
[2:30:47] because you begin to belong to the
[2:30:48] clique
[2:30:50] roof under calvinist
[2:30:53] come out of it
[2:30:54] it is homegoing time
[2:30:56] [Music]
[2:30:58] get to the message the message is a
[2:31:00] living person the message is crushed
[2:31:04] meet jesus christ build your personal
[2:31:07] relationship with god and prepare
[2:31:09] yourself for the rapture all these moves
[2:31:12] all this thing will remain here
[2:31:17] brother branham said when we go to
[2:31:18] heaven we will have our badges here the
[2:31:21] blood of jesus christ displaying what
[2:31:23] your favorite preacher
[2:31:25] displaying what the message of the
[2:31:28] hour
[2:31:29] [Applause]
[2:31:33] let's pray
[2:31:34] heavenly father
[2:31:36] lord we thank you father for your grace
[2:31:39] for your love and for your mercy
[2:31:41] father forgiven me grace to even reach
[2:31:44] this point
[2:31:45] lord somebody is touched somewhere
[2:31:48] and i know that this can go way way way
[2:31:50] beyond these four walls lord
[2:31:53] but father the purpose is to deliver the
[2:31:55] people because the time
[2:31:57] for going is at head
[2:32:00] there is no more time for move
[2:32:02] there is no more time to afford for big
[2:32:05] name of all or
[2:32:07] or building a platform for celebrity and
[2:32:10] things we heard so many stuff
[2:32:13] those that replaced brother branham
[2:32:14] those that took all kinds of stuff all
[2:32:16] over the world
[2:32:18] because they did they miss to understand
[2:32:21] the zeal of denomination
[2:32:23] that was coming up
[2:32:25] from the devil
[2:32:27] but further you say this message will
[2:32:29] never become a denomination
[2:32:33] the churches can be
[2:32:35] some people can be
[2:32:37] by the chosen elect like god
[2:32:39] when he please you in due time
[2:32:41] grace is coming to free your children
[2:32:44] completely
[2:32:45] until brother branham say that sometimes
[2:32:48] god can make a law a pastor to make a
[2:32:50] mistake to shake your faith away from
[2:32:53] the pastor
[2:32:55] so that the people all we can go back to
[2:32:58] christ which is our eternal security
[2:33:02] father may you help the people wherever
[2:33:04] they are
[2:33:05] if they're under a certain move or a
[2:33:07] certain tendency or a certain i don't
[2:33:09] know doctrine or whatever may they come
[2:33:11] out and return back in the middle of the
[2:33:13] road with the purity of the message of
