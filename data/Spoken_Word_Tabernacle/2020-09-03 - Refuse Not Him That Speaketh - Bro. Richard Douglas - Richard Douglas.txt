these lips tonight amen amen we sure appreciate it's been a while since we've seen you but you've never left a special place in my heart for you we've continued to pray for you and lift you up and we're sure you're just family you know we're blood king you know you know we come from a different kingdom in this world this world's falling apart but it ought to be a time that we recognize that god is pulling us together as his children amen it's that great capstone that's pulling upon us that's drawing us to him and we can testify of that tonight with the spirit of the lord when we're the pull that comes on us we're going up hauling grace grace grace and it's been nothing but his grace has kept us through these things i know we've been through hard times and going through different changes of situations and things but god's never changed he already knew these things would happen before they got here and he sent us a prophet in this hour to tell us these things was coming so we should not have been caught by surprise but we know that our god is faithful and true to us we sure appreciate each and everyone appreciate brother stephen and his wife we appreciate the work he's doing here we appreciate god using him i pray the lord will continue to use him to get you ready for the rapture amen that's what he's the prophet said the bride has come he has sent that fivefold ministry to address the bride and you know she only has a certain dress where you know where us the preachers are not fashion men we don't have a fashion that we address what we want to dress with god's already has a garment designed for her and all we do is put on what he asked us to give for us and you pull on the gift tonight will you i'm so you know i'm a little emotional tonight because you're such special people to me and you always got a special place in my heart and i hope you'll pray for me that god will help me when i'm out on the field trying to encourage and lift people up and strengthen them in the time of hour when we need one another we need one another i'm so thankful that god is in every present help in the time of need turn them into the book of hebrews chapter 12. it's a little simple thought the lord gave me laid on my heart and we sure appreciate him sure appreciate that he is still inspiring us he is still moving he's still speaking he's still he's still on the throne amen is he on the throne of your heart tonight amen i believe he is hebrews chapter 12 verse 22 it says come ye but ye let's see let's start but ye are come unto mount zion and unto the city of the living god the heavenly jerusalem and into an innumerable company of angels to the general assembly the church of the firstborn which are written in heaven to god the judge of all and to the spirits of just men made perfect and to jesus the mediator of the new covenant and the blood of the sprinkling that sprinkles better things than that of abel see that ye refuse not him that speaketh for if they escape not who refuse him that spake on earth much more shall not we escape if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven whose voice then shook the earth but now he hath promised saying yet once more i shake not earth only but also heaven and this word yet once more signify the removing of things that are shaken as of things that are made those things which cannot be shaken may remain wherefore we receiving a kingdom which cannot be moved let us have grace whereby we may serve god acceptably with reverence and godly fear for our god is a consuming fire lord jesus father i exceedingly tremble and quake in your presence lord as your servant moses said lord now father i'm asking you to come in and lord speak through me tonight lord you you know you know all my insufficiencies lord you you know that i'm just a man lord and i realized lord that a man can do nothing for these people here to tonight lord but i know one that can lord and i'm completely trusting in you that you would come and speak through these lips of clay one more time that you may edify your children strengthen them lord this you may lord help us lord if we need correcting correct us lord if we need encouraging encouraging encourage us lord whatever you have will for us tonight do it lord and we'll be so thankful and so honored the father that you would do these things lord and may we you receive all honor and glory in this service for we ask it in jesus christ's name amen and amen you may be seated i want to speak tonight on a subject refuse not him that speaketh you know when we hear there's a it seems to be that there's a spirit that's come upon this age in this hour that everybody is in a in a in a in under a spirit where they refuse everything they refuse headship they refuse any kind of laws they they begin to refuse even the preaching of the gospel they they're just it's just under a spirit of this ages is what it the spirit is is it's a resenting spirit and uh the prophet of god taught us that he taught us and warned us about the the spirit that was that was coming upon this age and you know if you don't watch it you hear some if you don't if you listen to too much media which i believe sometimes you know we we are in this world and you know things begin to happen and that we hear say it and we hear talk but we know that we're not part of this world you know this is this is not this is a this this is not our home this is not my kingdom this is not where i i am this is not my dwelling place but you know we want to uh i want to speak tonight about being just being guarding ourselves from the spirit of this age you know you know the spirit has come upon us to resent this this race against that race and this that but you know what when we become christians we we we don't have that resentment because we're we're not looking at race we're looking at the children of the living god and he he said in his word that they'd be uh he out of every kindred tongue and nation he'd bring forth a people and that's to believe that's what he's done i believe he's he's bringing a brother a bouquet of flowers a variety of of his children and if we don't watch it we'll get caught up in that thing and you know what we'll start resenting one another we'll start to get into the place where we resent this and this one and the that one and we get on that spirit we have to watch those things because that spirit is trying to overpower us it's trying to creep in to the house of god and let me tell you there has no place in the house of god oh i'm thankful for the power of god he has given us the power to love one another even love those who despitefully use us to bless those who curse us but you know in such a such a resentful age everybody talk about their rights we got this right and we got that right but i'm glad that there was a prophet coming this hour and told him that we are prisoners of jesus christ we have forfeited our rights we don't have no right we are his prisoners a prisoner don't have a right to do what he do what he wants to say where he wants to act the way he wants to but under the holy spirit when the holy spirit has come upon a man's heart and you become a complete prisoner to him then you know you're not your own tonight we must remember that we're not our own we've been bought with the price the precious price of jesus christ the blood that he shed for us we should not allow those things we are brothers and sisters in christ jesus and you know what it's even creeped into we we give it such a resentment to a certain preacher or a certain personality if he don't come we resent and we don't realize that we can be resenting the holy spirit we've not come to hear from a certain personality we've not come to hear from certain men we've come to hear what god would say to us we have a design the desire of the christians to hear from god we come to the house of god to be washed by the water of the word and he might cleanse us from all these things these things we've been rubbed up against all these these when we work and where we go to certain places going to the into the markets and different the department stores are spirits that try to get on us and what we must realize there's two spirits in this hour we know these things are simple to you but we know we got to always remember those things and be prayed up no matter where we go because we we shouldn't resent anyone the one we should resist is the devil my bible tells me resist the devil and he shall flee that's who i'm against i'm not against flesh and blood i'm not against people i'm against the spirit of satan in this hour there's cause to probably bring forth this unity among the brother it doesn't matter what church we go to it matters who we serve we're sitting under the headship of the lord we're to be thankful for for the pastors that stand for the word of god in this south thank god for men of god thank god for brother stephen i'm not here to to build up brother see what i'm here i'm here saying thank him i'm thankful that he is he is doing what he's doing a lot of people are not doing that no more a lot of people are preaching a social gospel i feel good that's not what we're here hey uh you know what makes me feel good when i hear the word of you know what god my soul is the truth you know what set me free is the truth and i'm so thankful for the power of god in this eye paul warns us this he warns us that we must be careful that we don't refuse him that speaketh you know that the voice of god is still speaking in this day it didn't die when brother branham left he said the spirit and the bride are saying the same thing it said come then the ministry will be saying the same thing they ought to be warning of this these things that's going on we're going to be in such unity reverend said when a man gets involved we don't try to take the ball from him what we try to do is we block for him that he might that he might reach the goal that god has ordained for him to reach we're supposed to love one another just because we don't agree with everything don't mean we shouldn't love one another but you know what god we i tell you one thing we better agree with that's the word of god you know what a lot of people you know we we're not here tonight you know and we're not standing around the holy mountain that that that the where the fire was and that fiery mountain that that moses come before and went up into that mountain and received the word of god but you know what that fear that god had on the people was respect for the for the presence of almighty god and there was such a presence upon god's servant moses that he had to wear a veil when he come down and you know what i believe that's what's happened in this hour in a lot of places that it's lost people have lost a respect for the word of god loss of respect for the ministry and we ought to be the lovers of truth we'll be the lovers of this i'll tell you what this message has done for me can i just preach tonight brother statement can i just let god have his way amen you know what i believe there's such a a spirit of refusal because people get in their mind this is the way i think it ought to be this is the way the the prophet man this is the way but you know what god said refuse not him to speak it he didn't bring me and you to interpret the word he sent a man that he'd give the interpretation to that me and you right receive what god has for us in this hour and he made it so simple for us he made it so plain that we would not stumble and we would not fall at it and he bring it and he give us eyes to see ears to hear and a heart to receive you ought to be so thankful for that tonight that god has given us a heart to receive the word of god it's how oh i'm so i can't i tell you i can't tell you how excited i am i'm excited that the word has come to me in this hour and has brought me to such a love affair with jesus christ jesus even told us he said if you if he said you'll know that you're my disciples that you have loved one for another that that's the key to it all if we can't i tell you paul said if we can't how can we love one we haven't seen if we can't love one another i i'm so thankful that god's given me that even when you don't see one another there's still ought to be a love in your heart there'll sort of be a thanksgiving for that there's still ought to be a hunger you know it excites me so much to see my brothers and sisters in christ i mean i can never express it with words how special you are how special the bride of jesus christ is she's an elect lady she's a very special lady but moses but paul is warning us to refuse not be careful your attitude toward the word of god brother branham said you know you can't even receive the holy spirit i believe that's what the what the problem is in this hour as many as says they they've received the holy spirit and have not because if you receive the holy spirit you'll receive the word because the holy spirit testifies of the word [Music] it shows that the word of god is living in us james told us in chapter 4 verse 7 he says submit yourselves therefore to god we ought to examine ourselves tonight and say lord have i have i submitted myself therefore to you if you're submitted yourself to him then you have the ability to resist the devil if you and then he'll flee people think well i i'll just i'll just i won't be bothered with it you have to resist those spirits you have to cast down those imaginations you have to bring every thought under the obedience of jesus christ and the message hear ye him he said if you wrote a letter you would perhaps appreciate that letter and if you wrote it to me i'm sure i would appreciate it but my letter would just be to you and therefore after you read it once you know all the meaning and the letter would be insufficient anymore to anybody else because it was destinated to you or to yours or to me but it's not so with god's eternal word it's inspired therefore it's to all people all ages to meet all conditions that's what makes that's what makes it worth repeating itself he says as history swings around it swings with history and it never loses its value i want to challenge you tonight has this message lost his value to you i tell you what has made me more appreciative than i've ever been in my life it's made me more thankful than i've ever been i'm so appreciative of what god has given to us in this hour oh where is your value at tonight is your is your value upon the things of the world are getting a new house or a new car or this we order where your heart is that's where your treasure is you know if we're this this is such a treasure to us it's so special to us i know this is simple things but we need to never lose our vision on this thank you brother i appreciate that i'm so thankful it's not lost it's value in an hour when satan's trying to devalue the word to you trying to make you to refuse him that speaketh but i'm glad there's something on the inside that longs to hear him he said my sheep know my voice and a stranger they won't follow it's god's eternal word it's it's expired it's inspired by god he said if it's god's eternal word because it's god's eternal word it never loses its value it cannot lose its value and to the believer it will never lose its value we don't care who tries to disprove it or who disbelieves it we still believe it not here to fight against man i'm not here to say it what i'm here to do is tell you look i'm thankful for what god has given us and the only thing we are resisting the power of satan you overcome him by the word of your testimony in the blood of the lamb in the message here ye him he said a postage stamp was sold for a million dollars you know a little boy had a postage stamp and you know the value of it he didn't know what the value of it was and he took it and he sold it and he got him like five dollars and and then the man that bought the stamp he made more money and then the value of it you know what his father oh i'm sort so thinking but god has not valued me when i first started is that this finished value but sister chanel i'm glad that he invaded me at the end the end of the product the finished work of jesus christ that's what he values me do we realize that that in the eye that we live in there's all kinds of spirits ungodly spirits all kinds of voices all kinds of influences but i'm so glad that this truth has such an influence on me that no man can take it away no man can talk me out of it no man can hold me from loving it no man can change what my heart loves because god changed my heart not my cart for he says as the man thinketh in his heart so is he you know that god has given us so many blessings so many things he's given us even i mean if we don't we we got a reason to be thankful even in the things that's going on right now you know what he said when these things happen look up he didn't say look down he didn't say be discouraged he said look up your redemption draws now i'm glad that we have a sure word of prophecy we can't control what's going on but we know one that is in control and if he don't forget about despair that falls don't think he forgets about you if he hung the stars by the breath of his mouth if he'd done all those things and placed all that in there and it's never moved by his word do you think that the bride that she's the word she received will be movable she's unmovable she's unmovable because this word is sure it's truth but you know what sometimes satan tries to get us to a place where we're so busy so busy we're so busy caught up in media and facebook and all these things and we fail to read our bible and pray that's what we need to do brother braham told us he said if you want to get close to god read your bible and pray you know what you know what you're the one that makes the service go good is your attitude what goes on here your attitude toward what's being said your attitude oh do you know your attitude determines your altitude i want my attitude right when i it's not all about preaching when i come to church i'm expecting god to say something to me i want god to speak to me tonight so when i leave this place i'll be a better christian you either have two choices here tonight you lead better or you leave worse but let me tell you the word of god will make you better because god is able to clean us and wash us by the washington of the word you know what busy is it's being under satan's yoke we get so busy brother mike that we don't have time for this we got this going on and that going and you know what we've got such an easy thing everything's a push button now but it seems like it took more and more of our time we're so caught up in what's going on in the world we're failing to see what god is doing in this hour god is moving oh hallelujah you know there's many ways to refuse him that speaketh let's see it by examination not not hearing not listening to his voice too busy listening to every other voice that's how you you ever you know sometimes you come to church and you get your mind on your problems you got your mind on what's going on this and that but you know what you need to come and say god i'm not they were not my problems those are your problems lord i'm going to cast all my cares on you for he careth for me and you know what he's the problem solver he's the one that keeps us in this hour we need to always have an open heart and an open mind to receive what the spirit is saying to us i've always come to church within trying trying my best to have the right attitude pray that before i get here with a desire to hear what god has for me do you know one word spoken from god can change your situation do you know that god can turn the man and go right down your alley and start ministering to your need god don't need the minister's notes what he needs he needs uh his servant to be yielded to the spirit of god the bible said sons and god sons and daughters of god are laid by the spirit of god oh i've seen god do it so many times i've seen i've been sitting in the previous and the minister be preaching and i needed something that god would speak to me to encourage me and speak to me and give me what i had needed and he'd go right down there come right off of his nose and walk right down there do you realize that there's angels in this place this is not just a this is just not a building that you know when you come the angels come with you for the bible said the angels in camp around those that fear and love god oh hallelujah you know what we should never let anything penetrate our minds let's not have god you know we can't stop him brother mike from flying over our head but we can sure stop him from making a nest we sure we can sure keep them from laying eggs a lot of people sometimes they they come and they be under they come into church and they're so disheartened so beat down and they're that they just can't seem like they can they they live from service to service but let me tell you what if you stay under the blood if you stay prayed up you'll get a bonus every time you come to church and every day i want a refilling of jesus i'm not satisfied with what i received yesterday i want more today but you know what a lot of people live on what they received the days before but we know what we've got a word we need now we need god to speak to us directly that we might leave the way he wants us to leave you know what we got to have a hunger for the truth you know he said it'd be a famine in this hour not for bread and water sister shanghai but for the hearing of the word you ought to be so thankful tonight blessed are your ears for you here blessing your eyes for your sea blesses your heart for your receive many are seeing and not seeing many are hearing and not hearing because they don't have that that special predestinated seed that special holy spirit that lives in you that can says amen to every word of god listen to this quote brother brown talk about in the false and the only ones at the end time talking about refused not listen to this he said he's the same yesterday today and forever we know that he said denying his word how did they deny jesus in that day who did they deny when they denied jesus the word he said they were religious they talked from their bible but they denied the present day word what are they today same thing anointed preaching the gospel of pentecost but the nine the present present-day promise of the word being vindicated jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever i can say amen with that even stephen run into that every christian is going to run in to things like those in acts 7 51 what did what did stephen tell him he said you stiff-necked uncircumcised their heart and ears you always resist what the holy ghost as your fathers did so do ye well they was happy until they come down and started preaching about the life let me come down and tell them how they was how they was refusing the word of god for their eye they were so happy with the priests kissing the babies and all these things and a happy but when it come down and they had to measure up with the word that's what that's what offended them brother mike i'm so thankful i'm not offended in jesus christ he said if you'll be you're offended in me in my words i'll be offended in you before my father let's turn to romans chapter 13. you still love the lord amen we sure appreciate you amen how could we not love him one who has given us what he's given us in this hour romans chapter 13 amen listen to us paul speaking to us he said let every soul be subject to the higher powers you know what everybody's so worried about the political powers about this when brother brown told us they wouldn't if they put a george washington or abraham lincoln in there it wouldn't change it why because they rejected their message for this hour it ain't going to matter who goes in what we got to do we got to be ready to go up how are you examining yourself and say god am i ready am i prepared am i willing am i looking for your coming i tell you what i don't believe people really looking for his chemicals they don't live like it hey he said you speak well of me with your mouth but your heart's far from me it's more than that brother brown even warned us he said satan don't care how religious you are he said he knows if you miss that life you miss it satan don't care how good you can quote say don't go care how good you can recite the scripture look the seven sons of stephen brother stephen thought that was enough just to know how to how to speak like paul how to use jesus's name but when it comes to a showdown that's where we're at because the bible we just read it where he's shaking everything he's shaking everything you must have that representation in your heart without that representation you're gonna be shaken off he said those things that will remain will be part of him [Music] oh hallelujah oh i'm so thankful for the grace of god he's shaking us he's asking us just like he did peter love us thou me more than these do you love him more than you love the world do you love him more than you love the things that were a lot of people ain't had no problem quit loving the world i don't see how mauricio he could anybody could love the world with all that but he's asked us a question even further than that do you love the things of the world he said if you do you don't even have the love of god anymore you know what that's a that satan is trying to attach us to our cell phones attach us to this and attach us to that but you know what we should be attached to the word of god the truth do you listen to the message do you read your bible do you live the message that's the key are you living what you believe because it says the sons of stephen thought well hey we just use this it worked for paul they said i adjure you by the message that paul preached didn't move him you can endure him by the message brother brown preached you're going to journal by them by the sermon brother stephen preaches or the ministers preach and even use the name of jesus christ but he said who are you you know what but even that's why they don't in that day he said he didn't rebuke them because they cast out devils he didn't rebuke them because they they did signs and wonders they laid hands on the scene he didn't rebuke him for that he rebuked them because he said depart from me you workers of iniquity i never knew you you never received me you never was born i was never born in your heart oh glory to god so it's more than just re reciting it's a living i'm so thankful that god has given us the ability sons and daughters of god to live the truth he said you know between the truth shall make you free has it made you free tonight i don't feel him but this message has never made me feel in bondage i know people think it's made them in bondage but it has not me i'm free and the bible says who the son is set free is free indeed the son of god set us free through the word of god and it was a privilege to hear it and the greatest thing was the privilege that you was able to receive it what is the paradox inside what is a miracle going on is that god give you the ears to hear god give you a heart to receive god give you a heart to leave this message and you know what he's rewarding you for something you had nothing to do all you did is yield yourself to him he said i am your guide oh hallelujah all we have to do is obey his voice listen to this for there is no power but the powers of god that be ordained of god whosoever therefore resists is the power resistance the ordinance of god but you know i understand when you resist the power of god you're resisting the ordinance of god the word of god you know what you can't live this message don't fool yourself i tried to live this as a young boy went out into the world but god's grace brought me back because it was a seed there sister cider he said he wouldn't lose one of us you can't you can't no more be lost than god can if you're a predestinated seed of god you're gonna come his the easy way or the hard way brother maurice i've got a lot of knots but i made it through but you know what the older i'm getting the more i'm learning to lean i'm learning not to refuse what god is speaking to us in this hour oh hallelujah the ordinance of god he said and they that resist shall receive to themselves what damnation so be careful what you resist i mean i'm so hey i'm just so thankful for the truth is for rulers are not a terror to good works but to the evil will thou then not be afraid of the power do that which is good and thou shalt have praise of the same what do you tell us to do brother mike return good for evil you can't do that let me tell you this flesh cannot do those things when somebody does you wrong something on the inside even though this man will get upset something on the inside that says father forgive them for they know not what they do now that's the spirit of the holy spirit that's god's spirit that's god's character that's god desire brother said there's only going to be one thing that we take out of here when we leave and that's the character oh he said for he is the minister of god to thee for good but if thou do not do that which is evil be afraid for he heareth not the sword in vain for he is the minister of god a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil wherefore ye must needs be subject not only for wrath but also for conscience sake for this cause pay ye tribute also for they are god's ministers attending continually upon this very thing oh if we could just recognize that it's not a man thing it's a god thing it's not a personality it's not a person it's the person jesus christ that's what we're here to hear here for tonight for just to hear from the personality of the holy ghost and what does the word always point us back to what does the spirit always point us back to the word of god you know some here intellectual the of it and then they've got this great revelation in their mind and they can't see anything else but what and then they build up barriers if you don't believe it like i do and you don't do it like i say but you know we must believe it like god sent it you know that's what happened to the calvins and the armenians they went out on a limb and when i let they didn't stay abiding in the vine brother mike if they had abide in the vine then the branches would produce that was more influenced by what the branch was going to do than what the vine was giving them oh they left no way to come back but if you stay in the middle of the road you won't have to worry about swaying here there what did this message come to do for the ministers to do the spirit of god come and what did prophet say when he seen the preview of the bride what was he screaming out stand line stay in line stand now that's what the five-fold ministry is here for the five-fold ministry is not a tape the five-fold ministry is alive and lives forevermore yes i listen to the tapes yes i push play but i tell you what god's got real men of god is preaching the truth and i tell you tonight be careful to refuse not him to speaketh because it's god that speaketh to us what did god choose to you he could have used the trees he could have used anything to do it but he chose man paul said in the foolishness of the preaching of the gospel that's what he chose and then sometimes you you know if you don't watch it you'll just say oh well it's just another service it's not another service this is going home time there's something being said i'm not promoting me i'm promoting christ i'm telling you don't refuse him be obedient to every word obey his voice he said my sheep know my voice no stranger they won't follow they won't obey nothing else i like a little thing i read one time about the shepherd you know the shepherd took a bunch of kids from school and they brought them down there to the shepherd you know and the shepherd was teaching them how to say things and how to how to call the sheep and bring them to get the sheep to come to them and obey and so they they got they tried to do it just like him they spoke like he did brother they moved like he did they commanded the way he commanded but you know what those sheep never moved until they heard the shepherd's voice ain't you glad no matter how close it is how good it sounds that you've got something on the inside that you can recognize the voice of god for your hour the shepherd there's nothing like that voice once you he's he designed a spec a special receiver in our heart that when that voice speaks we humble ourselves we say yes lord what did isaiah do when he really come into the presence of god and he's seen how great he was brothers and sisters and how magnificent he was he said woe is me a man of unclean lips you know and what did it take it took a cold off of the fire for him to do that you know he wasn't wanting to go he wasn't wanting to preach because he had his focus on a man but that man failed because he disobeyed god's word but then when that when that when that angel took that tongue and paul that fiery cold and laid it upon his lips he said send me oh my how can you be shut up they can't nobody shut you up they couldn't shut jeremiah up it's like fire shut up any bones i'm not here to fuss and hard and fight we're not here to dispute we're here to preach the truth and it's up to the up to us to receive it or reject it he said refuse not we need to have the testimony that the word of god lives in us it's not a recital of words it's a life that we have [Music] many refuse they accept the words but they refuse to life there's a lie this message brings a life it brings the very life of god in his bride this is not just any message this is not a denominational message this is the truth of god this is what has been ordained for me and you to receive this is not just in other words of a man this is the words of the living god that has spoken to us and we're blessed that we are hearing and we are blessed that we are receiving and we're blessed that we are living it many were offended at jesus that's right brother said they loved him when he healed the babies when he did all those things and he did all the things and but what changed everything can we turn to saint john 6 just for a minute i know this is this is still the truth amen oh my how beautiful god is you know what and i've never i tell you what i'm just what god made me i can't beat brother i can't be brother stephen god wanted me to be what he made me and i found out if i'll be what he made me he'll back up his word when i preach it and the prophet made it easy for us he said just say what i said hallelujah just say what i say you know some people refuse it because it don't come the way they want it to come it's not spoken the way they like it god don't care if you like it or not god said do you believe it do you love me oh hallelujah saint john 6 verse 66 look at this these are men these are men that receive the power of god to cast out devils heal the sick the seventy walk with him the rest of them was disputed against him because he said unless you eat my flesh and drink my blood you have no part of me god didn't explain it to them brother stephen he said do you believe me he even tried to he even tried to use their words to show them that it was the life in the blood it was the sacrifice that was being shed for them they must be a partaker of it they might what did he tell john eat the book these men were renowned men it's always renowned men look at corn david if you look at the scripture renowned men withstood moses was not just some fly by night it was men that had positions men that the people looked up to men that they trusted people trusted but you can't put your trust in me you must put your trust in god in his word oh man listen let's read verse saint john 6 verse 65 he said he said therefore i said unto you that no man can come unto me except it were given unto him of my father there is the difference maker if you've received this message and it's not been from the father you're going to walk away but if you perceive this because the father have given you this then you won't have to come under the curse of saint john 6 66 that was just not there by perchance that was even recognized in the bible 666 which is the number of man the mark would be listen to that and look at that these men was with him walk with him talked with him seen the miracles but yeah when the word test comes when the word test comes that's what brotherhood said you don't know where a man stands give him the word test you know what god's doing to me and you he's giving us the word test and guess what with the word on the inside we'll pass the test if we've received the spirit of god the holy spirit of god we can't say can't help but say amen he said from that time many of his disciples went back and walked with him no more you didn't see him again in the upper room you didn't see him at the day of pentecost you seen them no no more because why they refused to walk with oh my brother he said this is a dangerous time to turn and walk away refuse not him to speaketh you're not refusing man you're refusing god listen to this in verse 67 he said then said jesus unto the twelve will you go also that's the question he's asking me and you they went they walked away are you are you it's a challenge to us brothers and sisters are you are you going to leave me also well i like what peter said in verse 67 then jesus said verse 68 then simon peter answered him lord to whom shall we go thou hast the words of eternal life and we believe that's the kingdom and we believe and are sure that thou art the christ the son of the living god well then listen what jesus said jesus answered them have not i chosen you twelve and one of you is the devil he knew right down to the end who would betray him he didn't run him off he let him stay right there because he would let him know look it's going to be so close it's not going to be out there in the church world the baptist the methodist all that the pentagon that's that's not all about what it's happening here oh hallelujah i'm so thankful for the word of god you know what this has never offended me you know what it's done this message has made me examine myself made me look and see am i living what god god is expecting of me amen aren't you thankful for that aren't you thankful that he gives you the ability to live the word of god he said don't just be a hearer be a doer there's a lot of hearers but the doer lives in there paul even said when i go to do good evil's always present that's not your brother that's not your wife that's this yes he said but you just cast down the imagination bring every thought unto the obedience of jesus christ you know what some reject him because of their understanding he didn't ask me to understand everything he said believe it he said he that believeth on me hath present tense eternal life he that believeth not is already condemned i'm not here to condemn anybody it's what you believe what do you believe is what condemns you you know some people reject him because of holiness you know that's what they resent holiness but without holiness no man shall see god you know who's holy it's the god that lives in you makes you holy makes you live right makes you act right makes you dress right makes you talk right makes you live right that's what is that is the actions of the holy spirit you know what some rejecting brother steve because they want to fit in with the world they've got their eyes that's what happened a lot he looked down in sodom and the grass was greener but he failed to see the promised word was with abraham and guess what only him and his daughters get out they had to go through the tribulation but abraham didn't have to go i'm here to tell you you're not going to go through the truth this is not we're not in the tribulation what we are we're in the transition you know what people are falling brother stephen because they can't they fail to make it through the transition they're getting lost in the transition because he that hath an ear let him hear what the spirits say oh hallelujah oh but none oh i'm so thankful for the word of god aren't you he warned us don't refuse the ambassadors of christ men of god is ordained to preach this message i mean i love the way god is if i've had a question i've just put it on the shelf and i've waited on god to give me the answer do you know what if when i need that it comes at the perfect time and i say lord thank you for revelation but you know what a lot of people are doing but brad said if you don't understand something put it on the shelf but you know what people do and they're going back and they still don't have understanding and they're taking it off and they're making a mess of it when they should have waited for the understanding to come you can have wisdom but you and you don't have understanding the bible says ever learning and never coming to the knowledge of the truth you can learn and learn and learn and never come to the knowledge of the truth what is the truth is jesus christ is unchangeable in all of his ways he don't change for me he didn't change for this age people said oh he had to change to 50 this age you know he didn't the word he spoke then is still the word now oh hallelujah oh i'm thankful for the truth [Music] listen just hear him so no man is any better than his word he said i'm no better than my word you're no better than your word god is no better than his word and his word is a part of him your words are part of you my word are a part of me so being infallible his word has to be infallible god being omnipotent his word has to be omnipotent so you see it it's the value of it and it is in vindication to every mortal on the earth if that if it be received right yes it's the way you receive it you can either be deceived or received you can either resent or you can resist the devil and walk on either resent the word or you can resist the devil whichever one you choose jesus is challenging me and you choose you this to him you'll serve yes the world falling apart 1965 1962 he says but we got a kingdom and in this kingdom it has eternal life not membership but eternal life and it is governed by eternal king an eternal kingdom controlled by eternal king to an eternal people that were predestinated before the foundation of the world that's you that's me it's a predestination do we realize that we are now sitting in heavenly places in christ jesus not going to be we are all ready if you received the word of god for your hour you're sitting in heavenly places yes so thankful you know what we need to be we need to be faithful witnesses of his word you know what a witness you can't be a witness unless you've been partaker of it he said jesus said when the spirit of this lord when the holy ghost comes upon you i'll make you witnesses you know what you can't strengthen your brother you can't encourage your brother until you've been converted until you receive the holy ghost how can you give somebody something you don't have how can you offer somebody something you don't have yourself you can offer them words you can offer them this but that's all the seven sons of skeba receive but i want you to receive the life amen he made you a faithful witness he said peter when you're converted you won't do these things no more you won't reject me no more you won't deny me no more brother still you won't have no problems you won't be waved in you won't be swayed by things that happen you'll have a shrinker oh hallelujah listen in the message 19 respects 1961 he says the conclusion of the whole matter is to fear god and when you cannot have respect until you henceforth have fear do you not see everybody says no fear you don't fear you know what you know what the problem is people don't fear god i'm not talking about fear oh lord please it's reverence do you know why people don't even reverence the house of god do you know this is a holy habitation it's not holy because you're here it's holy because god's here god demands respect for himself for his word and for his people amen this is not a this is not just a motel this is the house of god that god has ordained for you to come together in this place we must look at it at more than just a place it is the house of god and the king dwells here this is the king's house this is his temple he said what have you done to my house you made my house a den of thieves he said well how you'll know that this is my house because you make it a house of prayer what should we come we should come and read our bible and pray that the spirit of god might move and speak to you before you leave respects to saint message 1961 he said now that don't mean that you're afraid of him but that means you're giving respects and reverence and when you respect god you fear god and you fear and you fear you might displease him in some way you fear at least you might do something wrong brother stephen pickles lost that you know what they don't care about offending one another he said if you offend the least of my little ones let's preach tonight if you defend the least of my little ones you've offended me where's the respect where's the honor that people give i honor you and respect you i wouldn't want to hurt you i'm hurting god you know what the prophet said he'd rather you love one another than love him you know what i didn't understand that but you know what sister he showed me why he said because when you're loving them you're loving me if we get that attitude brother we'd be careful what we say about one another we'd be careful how we approach one another we'd be careful how we treat one another because if you treat people that way you treat god that way too he said be careful you be under entertaining angels unaware same message he said you see you've got before you can have respect you've got to have fear god demands respect god does he demands it and fear brings it and we know that fear brings respect he demands it for his self and for his servants oh i'm glad that ain't you ain't you're glad that you are not you're not under that or you refuse him that's speaking if you get that attitude when you come to church it won't matter who's speaking as long as he's a real man of god do you know what disqualifies a man from being behind the pulpit brother stephen if he hasn't met the pillar right right and how can a man preach unless he see it oh i'm glad i met that pillow fire i'm glad i received that spirit of the living god oh listen to this you know what resentment is it's a bitter indignation treated unfairly that's what we're hearing all over the world we've been treated unfairly and people are but you know what i've forfeited my rights i'm not an american i'm i'm glad that i'm here in america because i still have the freedom to preach and come and go but i'm not an american i'm a christian there's a difference between an american and a christian i'm a christian that dwells in america and i want to present that life before the people because you're not going to win people unless you love them [Music] you know what some people get resentment because they've been demoted you know why people get demoted brother stephen because they don't do their job and people resent it but hey look at even even the prodigal son look at his approach when they even come back he didn't come and say look i'm your son you got to recognize me i'm coming back he said i'm just willing to be a servant that's me lord lord i'm willing to be a servant i'm willing to serve your children i'm willing to do whatever you want me to do lord just let me be in your presence let me be in your household oh hallelujah listen in the message 10 virgins and 144 000. he said see if you've got a resenting audience the holy spirit won't reveal think about that what we need to pray when we come to the house of god lord don't let this worldly resenting spirit come on me you know what that hinders the moving of the holy spirit in the house of god do you know whatever that hinders the moving of the holy spirit in your life when you've got resentment against one another oh hallelujah he said you have got to have something that working together he said they were in one place in one accord then there come a sound from heaven brushing see but when you got no matter how much i'd pray listen to this we put it all on the preacher so much and the preacher should do his job he should pray he should study but listen to what he said he said i he said no matter how much i pray lay lay day and night studying and praying before the lord walk down here maybe the anointing on me walk up here and feel resentment do you know how dangerous that is it's not a personality it's not a man you know what i had to fight that as a young man because people say well you need to hear this preacher and you need to hear that preacher and you hear you don't say you need to go where god tells you to go right you need to hear who god's ordained for you to heal we're not here promoting men you know what i went to no no no offense but i'll tell you how god taught me i went to a place and you know you know i appreciate brother donnie i'm pretty sure i'm glad god's touched him and all those things but you know where i went now because i wanted to hear brother donald i heard so much about him and i want to hear him brother steven and you know i got in i was that's who i come to hear i lost my vision as a young christian because everybody was pushing you know this you know you know how it is bro see when you're a young young man you know everybody's you're hearing everybody saying things you you they're pulled trying to pull you here and this way and trying to sway you now sitting down in there brother donald wasn't able to come so i got resentment i said man i drove all the way down here wasted my money i'm i'm telling you this is the way we think sometimes because i come to hear but and he's not here you know what i'm so thankful for the holy ghost brother stephen i'm so thankful for the holy ghost he come down upon me and he said who did you come to hear did you come to hear man of god i said lord i come to hear you and you know what it changed my attitude who did you come to hear from tonight a man personality would come to hear from god and he and you know what i realized that if i approach that every time i come to the house of god it don't matter who it is how far they up where they're at how low they are down you know what i'm coming to hear from god and if that's the man of god god's going to speak to that man to me and i'm not going to leave one listen to this he said the anointing on me walk up here and feel that resentment see it grieves him right away he won't reveal nothing what if we come to the house of god that god might reveal to us be careful that representing spirit that's in the world is creeping in the house of god oh god be careful he said but when you walk down here under the anointing feel your audience under the anointing that's when the holy spirit begins to work then he begins to move and do great things for us so you see oh hallelujah do you see the approach we ought to have when we come to the house of god we ought not to refuse him that speaketh amen we'll read one more quote i'm going to let you go amen i sure love and appreciate you i just felt like the lord laid this on my heart you know there's everybody everybody resents everybody you walk down the street nobody smiles at one another no more nobody waves at one another everybody's got their nose up in the air everybody's proud everybody's haughty and high-minded everybody don't have time to say i appreciate you you know what i tell people i appreciate you i appreciate you i pray you have a safe day you know that people look at me what's wrong with this guy i said you just ain't met my jesus i said i'm happy how can you be happy when you got to wear a mask i don't resent the mask i'm glad that we've been able to come to the house of god if that's all the devil's got it's too late a mass won't stop me from going to god's house i'm glad that god has given us the opportunity we ought to make the most of this listen to this in the message for him will i accept 1952. he said but now lady you're a christian he said i see that now see just as soon as you walk forward if you wasn't there would be resentment there see the holy spirit knows that it's not man it's not brother stephen knows that it's not the ministry no that's not the holy ghost the holy ghost knows that he feels it when you were sinning brother brown said they was the people the men would hug me and tell me they loved me and if they had a knife they'd stab me in the back that's not christianity don't say it don't tell people you love me with your mouth tell them from your heart he said i know that resentment was there he said let's see and i know that you wasn't a christian if you've got resentment brothers and sisters you're not a christian i don't care what you say i don't care how much the bible you can quote how good you can preach how good you can talk if you if you've got resentment in your heart you've got a problem you know what it is brothers and sisters there's a heart problem going on until you get your heart right you'll never walk right you'll never speak right you'll never live right he said there's something in your life holding you back he said that when there's something in your life holding you back bro steven it brings resentment to the holy spirit that spirit resents the word of god it resists the spirit of god said evil or something in your soul something that would that you could correct in some way but he said i didn't feel that when you come in lord help us as brother stephen comes lord help us to never come into the house of god with a resenting spirit we do not want to grieve the holy spirit we do not want to refuse him to speak amen oh i'm so thankful for the word of god we sure appreciate you love you such a special group to me always been my brothers hadn't changed my love for you but i sure appreciate you you keep standing for the truth the truth will set you free let's bow our heads if there'd be anyone here tonight say god help me help me never to be resentful to a man or to your children or to anyone oh god my hand goes up to lord i'm asking you to search us before we leave lord because you said correction begins at the house of god father so lord we've you have revealed these things to us now we repent lord we repent if we've had any wrong thought any wrong idea anything lord that we have resented anything you've said or your children said father your prophet says sometimes the devil will let we'll get on somebody and they'll say something just to see how we react father let us react with love but not let us react with anger father for that's the way you did because the bible said you knew there was no guile found in your mouth and lord your children we ought to be the same way lord we ought to be no guy found in our mouth nothing but joyful things and happy things father he you didn't tell us not to resist the devil but we do resist him but we do not resist flesh and blood we pray for them lord we pray for those who despitefully use us we bless those who curse us lord lord we just ask you now father to help us bless brother stephen lord here bless his wife lord continue to use him father may he carry these people to greater heights and greater depths lord for his obedience to you lord may you have your hand of mercy upon him father guide him got his footsteps got his thoughts got his heart got his lips lord may your blessing be upon him lord we ask these things in jesus christ's name amen amen amen can you sing that song i love him i love him because he first loved me brother stephen would come i love him [Music] i me and purchase my salvation [Music] amen that's my desire this evening is just to have the love of god in my heart as he was preaching i was just thinking about a couple days ago i was in a gas station and and a gentleman brought his his snacks his drinks and his gas or whatever he had and he was going to pay and i swiped my car before he got the swipe his and he was wondering what i was up to and he was asking me what are you up to what are you up to and i'm like i just i just wanted to do something i want to do something nice for you and i'm like in a world that is lacking love in the extent that it is in our time right now to where you can't even do something nice for somebody without them thinking you're up to something and i'm just like lord like allow me to have your love in my heart just like he was preaching tonight and also brother branham talked about just a small route of bitterness will completely strip the love of god right out of you so as as he mentioned at the end just any root of bitterness in my life i ask the lord to just break it out to clean me out clean me out give him give me his love i want to have his love in my heart for each one and i just pray that the lord just you know do that for me do that for this church god bless you brother richie we appreciate you thank you [Applause] we'll sing that again as we invite our pastor i love him [Music] emperor oh [Music] hallelujah you know you might not realize it probably but you wait on sunday if the dear lord jesus christ there you're going to see that this message comes from god the brother preach and give me key and confirm the third part of the mystery of the two steps he even give me a scripture that i have to use on sunday but when i preach on sunday you're going to realize that god was speaking tonight there is a separation that is happening it is not caused by you you're going to see it on sunday it is not you that is causing it it is caused by the timing and by the word of god you can't help it all you need to do is just relax because something is really happening you remember me using a quote where i say that god wants you to serve him in a different category yeah you're going to go through four steps in that category and it's going to be for this church if somebody is online who have subscribed and god speak to them praise the lord and those that are battling resentment online getting in the online trying to find fault or think that we have a problem with them may the holy spirit touch them tonight to change it but this is a different level not to make ourselves special but you're going to go through four steps from this church and the last step will get you into the rapture amen yeah we're going to get deeper he even i was preparing working on a sermon on the mystery of predestination and he spoke about predestination tonight he didn't even know the quote that i was preparing when i was at work working today you're going to go deep in predestination and you're going to appreciate more god in your life than ever and just by knowing what god has been doing through predestination is going to change you you won't be worrying about what is happening in your life once you predestinate there is a mystery that happened there and god work according to that plan so your life does not happen by any chance praise the name of the lord so there is a separation that is coming when you get to church get your heart prepared stay prayed up don't bring a spirit or let a spirit of resentment coming in whoever the lord is leading here god knows exactly what he's doing if a resentment is there the ministry cannot help you it's going to be like we're pouring water on the duck on a duck's back it's not going to help you so may the holy spirit unveil this to each one remove all bitterness we have been hurt we have been done things wrong we have been like dumped down but don't build a complex against it everything is working together for good you
