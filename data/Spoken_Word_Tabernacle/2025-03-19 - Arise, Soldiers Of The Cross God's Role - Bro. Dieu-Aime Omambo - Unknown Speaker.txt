up and he said well there's another part we're going to have to order and I'll come back when we get it in and put it in well when I got home Sunday I stood in front of the thermostat and I spoke to that air conditioner I said Satan you're not doing this you know and so he came today well they called last night and said they were going to be out this morning and the secretary at Pritchard heaing uh she goes to I've known her for years she goes to um uh Berry coffees uh we used to go to church at brother Joe's over there but and I told her I says well don't be surprised if he comes back with

though in my heart I have questioned even fail to [Music] believe he been faithful faithful to me when my heart looked away so many times I could not pray still in love he proved faithful to me the

family members here God richly bless you and welcome brother Cody and sister Ru you not I cannot even say anything you're just part of this church amen good to see you again tonight God bless you and we trust you have a wonderful time amen with the family together amen Wednesday is our convention time so we're here to get into the word and to pull from the word of God Amen now how many are waiting on the Lord for something you know when you're waiting you know what to do right amen though the promise is tearing how do you wait praising the Lord and in Thanksgiving amen I believe it was either brother Robert we were talking as say Abraham when he was waiting he also was even preparing for the promise Not only was Abraham giving God glory but he put things into action amen so wedding is not what we thought waiting like Sting and just saying what are you doing I'm praying I'm waiting on the Lord no I'm praying I need a job no when you're praying you need a job when you stop I mean praying go ahead and stop putting make some application amen don't sit there and doing nothing and you say I'm waiting on the Lord amen amen we have an active faith not a passive one and then you're going to be blaming God you say I was here I was serving you all this day and look at this one no no no no no that one knew how to act the prodal son when he say I will arise and go to my father he doesn't sit anymore once he said that he rose and he begin to walk toward his father amen he didn't stop and say wait a minute what about if I go to the father and the father say I don't want to see you again what about if I go to the father and then the whole neighborhood begin to shout at me what about if I get to the city and all my old friend be I mean uh begin to look at me and then say look what have become to him that was none of his problem amen the target is I got to change my condition from what I am now to what I wanted to be and then he move on and as he's moving guess what who was there the Bible never mention about the neighbor the friend or the old people in the city the Bible only mention about the person he was going to so God I we we catch up on this on Sunday amen I'm not the one preaching amen don't sit down and wait the way human being are waiting amen waiting on the Lord wait like Abraham amen if you need something go walk in it amen talk about it praise God about it thank God about it amen amen because those that are waiting for the Lord those that wait upon the Lord they do what how do you renew the strength by waiting so there is something about that waiting on the Lord that will renew your strength and the Bible say when you renew your strength what do you do you man up I could not even touch that on Sunday you man up with with wings like what and what happen when you [Applause] run you shall walk and what so your walk become a different walk your running become a different running why because you got something somebody else will run and they will get weary because they're not waiting on the Lord but if you really truly are waiting on the Lord the correct way when you run you won't be weary when you walk you won't Fain amen because there is something about waiting on the Lord that is recharging you and that is giving you power Abraham where is the baby oh praise the lord it's this year but you have been waiting 10 years forgeted it is this year Abraham what do you think now it's 11 don't worry brother Bram say you know what it's going to get even bigger and greater Abraham 15 years you still holding on of course it is just like yesterday Abraham it's 20 years and finally at 25 now the miracle became greater it was no longer about just giving a child now they got to renew somebody give somebody a about change and remember if they give a body change the way it was originally Sarah could have been young and Barren I don't know if you get that the problem was Sarah was baren so if you just renew Sarah back again it's going to be the same Sarah and baren and the problem is still there so when you wait too long when the miracle comes it renews Sarah and also went and healed Sarah amen that's why when we we we will receive our body change there won't be any sickness again any defect that you have will be corrected right there and we will go into the Rapture completely here amen the longer it's taking the greater the miracle amen you were waiting for a baby now God give you a body change God give you the baby and God even deliver Sarah's womb all three by waiting amen amen glory to God married couple remember it's in a hotel everything the same we see you at 2:00 you don't do anything just be happy bring your smile come there on time and let's have some good time amen technician you're ready for it right the team are ready so the team are ready the technician are ready so the guest need to be ready if not I go through the byways amen if not I go to the byway so make sure you stay there in your spot amen and we will have some good time wonderful with the Lord amen this Bible is something else with the message of the the pro you read the quote you see something you turn around two mouth you read the same code and it looks like you miss something that you were reading the same it's like what is going on it is God who's unveiling himself God want every aspect of our life to be touched to be changed and to be completely different amen I came a little bit early I was in the office I said let me read the Bible and then start preparing for a scripture for Saturday and I say let me start reading book of Romans chapter 1 and I begin to read chapter one I begin to write things left I read this many times but when I begin to read it looks like something new something news I say I understand this even better today than I understand yesterday brother we would never finish this part the power in this message is so strong I told my wife one quote one paragraph of brother Bram can preach the Bible for for three month one paragraph I'm not talking about one sermon when you open brother brandham sermon and you read one paragraph if you stop with one paragraph you take that one paragraph you put it in the Bible you can preach for three month that's so what you think it's a thousand and something uh What uh sermon it is more than that it is more than that it is powerful I told my wife I say what he just mentioned right now it can be a teaching for month this message we are so privileged hold Titan to the word it will produce what God say it will this message is real this message is Christ Amen brother Albert brother JM is preaching tonight you know him one of the folks down here so pull on the gift of the Lord and let's hear from the Lord It's really amazing when we see these young folks full of energy serving the lord amen so brother Albert you can come on only believe [Music] [Applause] [Music] forever oh [Music] believe are possible [Music] oh [Music] believe all things are [Music] possible amen God bless you thank you musicians God bless you all Saints I believe we're doing good amen that was a very wonderful worship service yes sir brother brandom say if you have the right music under on the piano playing the right music on the piano on the organ on the instrument it creates such a good atmosphere that Jesus in the midst of it can do anything and everything that you're in need of amen and I believe someone probably received something by the worship amen and with the little bit of appetizer that the pastor just gave I was hoping he would have continue but with the little bit of appetizer I believe someone got something now I won't hold you all if we could go to our scripture in Exodus also thank you again brother Steven for this privilege to be here in front of the Bride every single time I have to come here it gets me very nervous I was was even shaking before I got up here if you're there can you say amen amen amen Exodus 17: 8-9 first let's go to God In Prayer Lord heavenly father I thank you Lord God for watching over us I thank you Lord God for giving us a breath of life for bringing us here thank you for the worship sir Serv Lord God it was magnificent magnificent Lord Jesus Christ I thank you for everything that you've done for protecting us in the highways and byways Lord God lord Heavenly Father we come to you Lord God to listen to you Lord God not to listen to a man but to listen to you Lord God may you use me may you speak through me Lord God and may you listen Lord Jesus Christ through your people and through me also Lord Jesus Christ I thank you and I bless your remaining of the service onto you in Jesus Christ name I pray amen amen now in Exodus chapter 17 verse 8-9 it says then came AMC and fought with Israel in refidim and Moses said unto Joshua choose us out men and go out fight with Amal tomorrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the rod of God in my hand may the Lord God bless the reading of his word you may be seated amen for my subject tonight will be arise soldiers of the Cross and as a subtitle it will be God's role and before I start I want to First say that uh what's it called for I want to say congratulations brother Charles for last Wednesday was very nice because what he preached it's like we were in the same road because right right before he preached like the night before I was talking to someone we're talking about faith and he came in and about it and he also mentioned something in particular that I also want to mention here because I did some research upon it yesterday what he was mentioning about was the natural birth how brother brandham said that it's a very mysterious thing that the natural birth how can because it's mysterious and wonderful because uh what's it called out of the experiment because I did research it was like 20 million to 600 million sperms and out of all of that you were chosen you were predestined to come out and that's that's a very some that's something very uh what's it called very good that you can hold on to to place your faith upon if you ever feel down that's something you can hold on to but let's say if you don't have uh what's it called the faith to hold on to that well think about it this way back then it was you versus 20 million to 600 million other experiments but now in today's life if you take you apply to today there's like 8 billion people in the world there's like there's like one .3 billion that are like of Islamic faith and 3 billion that are like Christian most of them are denomination Catholic but now there's 8 billion out of 8 billion people God chose you to be in this message God chose you to run this race and out of every single every single one um of those eight billion you being chosen that's something that's a great feed that's a great achievement in itself and that's something to be proud of if you ever fill down just remember you were chosen and the thing about being chosen is yes sir you can't just stop just because you're chosen because you're supposed to run the race and go all the way to the end you see run the race and go all the way to the end that's when you get that's when you will be crowned because it's to them that overcome that's when you will get your trophy it's basically like a track when you're racing and the thing about track is I'm not trying to uh what's it called promot the spirit competition but we're supposed to compete to reach Christ because that is our goal because when you're when we're brothers and we're racing to reach Christ as um because if I could use the board to illust real quick I believe everybody can see it because it's a race and yes we're racing but we're racing our goal is to achieve Christ imagine this is Christ this is Christ and let's say when you're born someone may be here someone may be here someone may be here someone may be here and as we're racing the goal is to reach Christ as you're racing you're coming to Christ he's coming to Christ she's coming to Christ we're all coming to Christ by the time we reach our goal all of us will be United that mean the race to reach Christ it's not yes it's an individual walk but towards the end we'll all it's like it's a many member um many membered body you see so as we're racing towards Christ and we're feeding on the word and we're walking on the own individual walk it's also bringing us together to Christ you see because if one person let's say one person is walking the other one is backsliding and as if I'm walking and you're backsliding the distance between me and Christ are getting closer and the distance between me and you are getting closer or getting farther apart if let's say uh what's it called neither of us are moving or both of us are moving away from Christ the distance between us and Christ is getting further apart and the distance between me and you also are getting farther cry farther apart anyway that was just a little thing that I wanted to encourage someone if you ever feel low just remember you were chosen to run this race out of 8 billion people you were chosen and even then there were people that received the first oil but you have to receive but you were chosen not only for the first oil but for the second oil for the word of the of your day the message of your your time now if we go if we go if we could go back to our scripture where we read Because as you can see the title is arise soldiers of um the cross God's role and the reason why I say God's role was because when I was reading this I found out there was our role and then there was God's role because if you read it says Moses said unto Joshua and if you remember God had made Moses a god onto the Egyptian onto Pharaoh but then again that godhood that God put upon Moses didn't limit just at the Egyptian because when when Moses went to the Egyptian and went to Pharaoh he said let my people go see he was he was God's people but he was calling it his own people see God had made him God unto other people and brother brand had also said that a Christian is supposed to be like a typologist you're supposed to type the scripture type the old to the new and even type it to your current time and right now I'm typing Moses to God and Joshua which is a type of Christ is also a type of the Holy Ghost and I'm typing that as the Holy Ghost because it says because it says Josh Moses said unto Joshua choose us out men you see because the Holy Ghost the purpose of the Holy Ghost which was which is the third person the Trinity the purpose of it is to choose the bride and enter into the bride and after you choose the bride that's when your battle um starts your battle between you and Satan because the thing that triggers Satan is God and if you don't have God in you Satan will not be be triggered and when someone is not triggered they will not react you see and over here it says Moses said unto Joshua choose us out men and go out fight with AMC that's our part that's the holy ghost coming in us and after it comes in us we go out that we fight with uh what's it called the spirits that are coming around that's our parts then the part where where I'm typing it as in God's part which is Moses he says tomorrow I will stand on the top to of the hill with the rod of God in my hand see that's when he went up the mountain which represented also the cross Calvary that's God's part that's what God is going to do that's right if we could drop sorry but we'll be doing a lot of reading today but if we could drop to verse 11 it says and it came to pass when Moses held up his hands and Israel prevailed and when he let down his hand amalec prevailed but Moses hands were heavy and they took a stone and put it under him and he sat there excuse me put under him and he sat there on and Aaron and and her stay up his hands and one of the one on the one side and the other on the other side and his hands were steady until the going down of the sun see that represent the great battle at Calvary the great battle between um the great battle between between death and uh what's it called God death and life the great battle between death and life that Jesus overcame and and in that battle there's God's part and there's our part because if you go down to verse 13 say Joshua's conf confited AMC and his people with the edge of his sword and like I said Joshua representing the Holy Ghost representing us that's our part but I'm specifically focusing on God's part today and if we go to uh what's it called because if we go to verse 14 and the Lord said unto Moses this is the Lord speaking write for a memorial in a book and rehearse it in the ears of Joshua for our will utterly put it in the ears of Joshua for I will utterly put out out the remembrance of AMC from under heaven when I was reading that scripture it would kind of pause me I was like why did he just say Joshua so I decided to consult some people and ask like my father asked brother Charles I asked them what what they received out of it because when I saw I felt something was there but it's like it's as if I could have obtaining and when I asked them and one had said well God was telling to remember was telling Joshua tell Moses to tell Joshua so Joshua can tell the Miracles that had happened for Generation to Generations so they can keep remembering it for generations to generations and at the other hand the miracle that happened which represented the cross represented Calvary Moos God is telling Moses to tell Joshua that you need to look up a Calvary you need to look up a the great battle that y'all had won and that great battle is what helped Joshua have the faith to face the son and to tell the son to stop the the the fact that um God told Moses to keep reminding Jo Joshua is a type of God trying to reinforce his faith you see because Faith by experience it's a type of God reinforcing his faith because when I was reading the scripture I found out that there's like a freebie uh for blessing here why because Jesus has said Jesus has said blessed is he that believe with without seeing just by hearing and if you notice here God said he will wipe out amale completely out of the face of the Earth meaning there will not be any source for you to trace or there will not be any evidence for you to see that means for you to believe it's going to be hard to begin with then the only way for you to even know that story exists is by you hearing and by you hearing it you have two options either to accept it or to to um deny it and by you accepting it that's an automatic free blessing right there that's that's automatically uh automatic free blessing that Jesus placed there for people to get um freely just like the serpent seed if you look at the serpent seed when if you look at the Bible a Ser the serpent was an upright being but because of the Fall God had completely broken down the trace of the serpent that if you're looking back in history you're trying to find that animal that was the closest to mankind you won't be able to find it that mean to even believe a snake used to be a upright being is very hard to believe but God erased that completely so that way the only way that you can understand or know of the story is by hearing it and when you hear it and you accept it that's an automatic free blessing which is connected to what the word of Jesus Christ that said blessed is he that believe without seeing the the one that are not looking for physical evidence because many people tend to seek for physical evidence and um if we could go to verse 16 for he said because the Lord has sworn that the Lord will have war with Amal from generation to generation this battle here is between God and Amal it's not between uh what's it call also em between God and EM because if you remember the title is God's role that mean we're we're finding what is God's role what's God's business in this war what is God's purpose in this war what is God's purpose in our life in this war how is he going to help us you see and I want to also read brother Brandon brother Brandon has said and stand still and see the salvation of the Lord paragraph 40 I preach Christ the same yesterday today and forever stand still and see the glory of God it's not your battle to begin with it's God's battle it isn't your promise to begin with it's God's promise and see he said that it's not you didn't begin to you didn't even start the battle to with so why are you worried over it remember uh the word was preaching say worri for nothing you see I stand tonight it's not my worry to to find out about this woman is God's promise to do it that's right I stand still and the glory of God does the work it's kind of like this Sunday when uh the pastor had asked uh what's it called when the pastor had asked sister yok he was like were you worried about this did you pray about she was like she said no see it wasn't her job to worry about when when the uh hus is going to come all she had to do is just stand still and wait and do God's work you see I put one I put one of my word I put one of my own words in it wouldn't be right I don't put my words in I just stand still let God do it don't you get worked up say well if I had prayed if I had a prayer card it says to stand still because a lot of people want to rush like to say like the word has been preaching a lot of people want to put God in a box the box of time instead of standing still and waiting upon the Lord You Prayed sure that your prayer went now you stand still and you wait and the thing the reason why people like putting God in a box of time is because we were placed in a box of time we were plac in the box of time if you even go to uh Psalms 89 there was someone that had sent me this earlier if you go to Psalms 89 uh you don't have to go I have it right here uh it says how long Lord will thou hide thyself forever sh shal thy R burn like fire remember how short my time is wherefor hast Thou made all men in vain what man is he that liveth and shall not see Death Shall he deliver his soul from the hand of the Grave saah Lord where are thy former loving kindness which thou swearest unto David in thy truth see this this um this scripture because our life is shortened we want to put God in uh what's it called we want to put God in a time box and we want to accelerate the blessing to come faster because we're looking maybe uh for example you could be sitting down in your living room after you see how the news someone that was your age just died and you're like that could be me so now you go pray and you say Lord God make can you make it faster because I could die at any moment so I want the blessing to come faster before I die you see we want to put God in the time box because we ourselves are in a time box because death can take us at any moment if he doesn't take us right now through a heart attack he's going to take us by old age we're in a taking uh what's it called Time Bomb so we want to also put God in the same uh place as us and the prophet of God says he continues says so in the great day of hour of FL fluster which is like agitation the Lord spoke and he spoke to a little Prophet standing near excuse me who says stand still and see the salvation of God you'll not have to fight this battle so you might be going through some trials and earlier we had found out that a prophets anyone can be a prophet you see and I'm not saying like I'm not just talking about a major prophet not anyone can be a major prophet don't get that wrong but anyone could be a prophet why because the word of God comes to the prophet and the prophet goes and preach it and I could top it because the word of God came to brother brandom and brother Brandon preached it that makes him a prophet and he's the major prophet but now since the word of God came to brother Brandon I'm not taking that word of God from brother Brandon and I'm reading it that mean that word of God also came to me and by me preaching it that means I'm doing the works that the prophet did and remember I said everyone can also be a prophet how about the sisters since they can't come up and minister they can Minister through their own life because brother Brandon said preach um live me a sermon not preach me one you see through your own life you're ministering to your folks your neighbors left and right and it says uh what's it called the little Prophet standing near who say stand still as the word has been coming forth and telling you when you pray just be patient wait on God's time it's telling you to stand still you see but as long as they were together and praying and praying it was God's battle you see and I think the same thing applies tonight that mean through your trials that you're going through May you have prayed for or not just stand still doesn't say sit down still but stand still and in this great hour where the church where the great church people and the great churches are stewing and fussing with each other and and denominational barriers are breaking us apart and we battle from this side and that side it's time to stand still God it's God's battle see you you really don't have much to do in this battle it's God's B he said it's his battle against the and it's going to go for generations to Generations you see and it Contin says it's not ours to begin with God wants us to stand still and when God gets ready to do anything usually he commands his people to stand still you see I found out recently there's a lot of um kids in here that took RTC you know and I myself also took RTC and whenever there's an announcement ready to be given because I was like a master surgeon um during my senior year whenever there's a announcement ready to be given a command that's ready to be given that my teacher would tell me call the platoon at ease at ease that mean you have to stand at ease you stand still so you can wait for the word to come forth you see and of here brother Brenham is saying before God gets ready to do anything he usually commands you to stand still and when God usually commands someone to stand still that's when someone wants to actually start moving because even in RC when you command someone stand still you will see certain people they're like fidgeting a little bit or trying to talk to their neighbor when God said to stand still and wait for his command and um this i p here the captain of the lord of the host because uh what's it called if you go to Joshua 5:20 when Joshua is a man of war he was always ready because when he saw a man coming he automatically took out his uh sword meaning he had his sword on him he always he was always on guard you couldn't find him slacking and brother Brenham said uh what's it called a sword represents prayer a sword is also the word that he always had the word on him to fight with and when he noticed the man that was there was the commander was the captain of the army of the Lord he worshiped him and brother brandham has said that that Captain that man was Jesus Christ that man was Jesus Christ brother BR has said uh what's it called he said nay but I'm the captain because this was when Joshua asked the man who are you are you for us or against us he was like nay but I'm the captain of the host of the Lord take off the shoes upon your feet I love this part for the ground you stand on is Holy because Joshua was under the uh Ministry of uh Moses and Moses had to do the same thing so Joshua is repeating what his Prophet did you see and that mean we should also repeat what our Prophet did that we should experience what our Prophet also experienced he met Jesus there face to face the captain of the host of the Lord and he told him what to do to March around the walls sound a trumpet let out a shot and the walls of Jericho would fall and they took the land of Palestine settled down in there as God promised them because the promise of God was for them see if you read all of this it's just God God God it was God it was Jesus and as our title is It's God's role I want to focus on God's role in this whole entire battle and if we could go to uh go back a few chapters Exodus chapter 15 Exodus chapter 15 because I want to talk about how God God's role what is God actually doing in our life through this uh battle that we're facing to this war that we're going through if you if you there can you say amen amen Exodus chapter 15 I'll try to like kind of speed a little bit through it then then sang Moses let's start verse one then sang Moses and the children of Israel this song unto the Lord and spake sing I will sing unto the Lord for he hath triumphed gloriously and the horse gloriously the horse and his rider have he thrown into the sea this is talking about Pharaoh's horse and his Riders see this is God who's the one who's doing everything the Lord is my strength and song if you remember there's a scripture in the in the Bible where it says that God is strong with capital S saying that that word strong is God himself he is my strength and song and he is become my salvation he is my God and I will prepare him in habitation my father's God and I will exalt him when I was reading the part where it say I will prepare him in a a um habit a and I was like let me type it to myself because God does not dwell in a um habitation created by man's hand and I was like then what type of habitation could I prepare for God I was like it's myself because God created me so the best thing I could do is prepare this body for God let me consecrate this body so God can use it to its utmost um um potential so they think that I could prepare is my body for God to use then verse three the Lord is a man see he say God is a man so let's find out what type of man he is and say the Lord is a man of war the Lord is his name see it says the Lord is a man of war now let's find out what does the Lord do in War what is his role what does he do in war it say Pharaoh's chariots and his host have he cast into the sea his chosen Captain also are drowned in the sea in the Red Sea see it's God who's taking the Pharaoh and throwing a out God who's taking his uh what's it called his soldiers and also throwing them out and if you drop down to verse six where it says thy right hand oh Lord is become glorious in power thy right hand oh Lord has dashed in pieces the enemy I remember many time brother Bron has said what's it called um the right hand of God represents power that's right it represents power and authority when Jesus went to the right hand it was the right hand of God which represented power and if you look uh what called in Matthew 26 verse 20 uh 64 and even L Luke 22: 69 Jesus says that he goes up to the father to the right hand of power which the right hand speaks of power itself and now let's find out what type of power is being manifest through the right hand of God because we're trying to find out what God is doing in our life through this war you see and in verse six again it says if you uh the second half of the Scripture it says thy right hand oh Lord now watch what he does it t right hand oh Lord have dashed in pieces the enemy see is destroying the enemy in pieces and in the greatness of thy Excellency thou H has overthrown them that rose up against thee when I was reading this scripture there was something that hit me because Jesus has said that you will be persecuted and you will be you will go through trials and tribulation people will hate you they will not hate you because of of you but they will hate you because of God and when that scripture came to me and I was reading this and it was like in because I decided to re replace it time with Jesus because it's talking about God and it was a in the greatness of Jesus Excellency Jesus has overthrown them that rose up against Jesus meaning those that rise up against Jesus in your life God himself is overthrowing them God himself is watching over you and overthrowing them in your life as you're going through your battles you see that's right and in verse 8 and with the blast of thy nostril the waters were gathered together the flaw stood upright as as a heap and the death were conil in the heart of the sea the enemy said I will pursue I will overtake I will dive I will divide the spoil my lust shall satisfy upon them I will draw my I will draw my sword my sword my hand shall destroy them see this part is where your enemy because your enemy it could be your neighbor it could be someone that you don't know that are always wishing for your downfall that was always trying to bring you down and they're probably probably somewhere praying for your downfall they think you're maybe you're just barely living and they see to them it looks like you're all the way up above although you're barely making it and because they see that you're better than them they're trying to pray for your downfall instead of trying to pray that you get lifted up because if get lifted off you will bring them with you but they don't have that mentality so they try to bring you down to their level and and watch what the Lord does to people that come in your life that are trying to bring you down they trying to uh pre preach or speak upon your downfall and it says in verse um 10 thou dest blow thou did blow thy wind in the sea cover them they sank as as lead in The Mighty water see God Blow The Wind and he sunk them that mean any enemy that comes against you they shall not Prosper any weapon that comes against you it shall not Prosper why because the Lord God is protecting you the Lord God's role is to protect you through through the whole entire um combat that you're facing you see when enemies are coming in like a flood they're fighting against you they're they're speaking of your downfall God is raising up a standard and usually when God rais up a standard the standard some is the standard of his word and sometime that standard of his word is not just is is usually tightening up his word you see because nowadays when everything is online everything any type of um Spirit attacks everything is online the Lord God is tightening it up and telling you you shouldn't do this you shouldn't do this you shouldn't do this he tightening it up and by him tightening it up is making it harder for you it's making the standard go up now you have to try to reach and follow the standard you see it's not because if you look at people in the denomination when you give them the word when they look at the word most of them when you give them the word they're like well the word says to come to the Lord as you are you see and they will come to the Lord as you are and they will stay as you are but the thing is when you stay as you are the enemy will come in and start giving influences left and right and when the enemy start giving influences left and right the word of God will tighten that's how the standard is lifted the standard is lifted because the word is tightened it's telling you now now as You Came As You Are now you can't stay as you are anymore because the enemy is coming it's like it's like you're uh what's it called We're pilgrims we're advancing in the we're advancing to get to the promised land is you came to a certain place you placed your tent you got a little bit comfortable and now God is telling you to he's starting to tighten you up and say now it's time to get up and keep moving you can't stand there it's time to get up and keep moving because the enemy will be [Applause] coming and um if you go to verse 11 who is like on to thee Oh Lord among the gods who is like thee glorious in Holiness fearful in Praises doing wonders because if you look at this even John when he went up in heaven he was like who is worthy to open the book and it was Jesus Jesus the only person that is worthy there's no one that's more worthy than anything even the Bible says the Lord your God is one there's no other God like God when Elijah was um was doing Miracles and he was was going against all denominations he told all of them to to call upon their gods nothing happened and Elijah maybe all he did was it was just the thought the moment the word was about to come that had the fire automatically Dro you see there's no God like our God out of every other gods there is that's right and if you pay attention he says fearfulness is is fearful in his praise the Lord God is fearful in his praise you see why because if you look at Jericho what brought down the wall it was wasn't people taking their sword and you know Hing on the wall or taking a hammer and you know what it wasn't someone that was like well you can go around the wall seven time as you're going around the wall I would just be chipping away over here making it wicker you know it wasn't that God told them to go around and after they went around God said Shout Scream give her praise there were praising the Lord worshiping the Lord and that worship is what brought fear brought the wall to come down you see verse 12 it says Thou thou stretches out thy right hand speak of that power again and watch what that power does the Earth swallowed them up you see that's the power of God thou in thou in in thy mercy has led forth the people which thou has redeemed has guided them in thy strength onto thy holy habitation see when I was reading this there was something that came that stru me because it said the people that you have redeemed and if you remember God redeemed us purchased us at the cross the price was already P was already paid at the cross and the scripture didn't stop there it said he's guiding Us by his strength to his holy habitation and he God God's holy habitation does not dwell in a place created by man but he dwells in a place that he himself created and God dwells in the seventh Dimension which is consist of the word brother brandham says it and it's God himself God is leading us to Heaven God is leading us to himself you see because he doesn't stop there says he's guiding Us by the strength and remember there's a word in the Bible that says God is the strength and God is the word that mean he's leading Us by his word that mean he purchased us purchasing us and he gave us a map and he said this is the place where you're going to go and God did not stop at just giving us a map to go to uh what's it called the place that he had um in store for us he didn't stop at that after he gave us the map he started talking us through on how to arrive at the destination because it says he's guiding Us by his strength you see he didn't stop at that he's also guiding us and leading us through the to arrive at our destination because that is God's role in this um war that we're going to am and if you go verse 14 says then people shall hear and be afraid sorrow shall take hold in the inhabitant of Palestine the only the people that are hearing and being afraid are the people that are not with God you see because if you're a child of God and after that you're reading certain scripture you're not going to be afraid because that's your God that's talking like if you're reading the book because I remember I was talking to a coworker my long time ago and because I love sharing the scripture and when I got to the Book of Revelation she was like I don't like I mean she didn't say she doesn't really like it but she said that book of Revelation scares her she said that book scares me how are you talking about it so lightly and and joyfully and I was like I'm talking about it so joyfully because it's literally the message of love the whole if you read about it God is coming he's even giving Grace onto his people even judgment is actually is the judgment is actually uh what's it called a Grace for the people that are not going to get raptured when I was reading at that it's it's a Grace for certain people you see and the only people that get scared of the word of God when the word of God is coming is people that are not in order with God it's people that are not a part of God you see and then it continues then the Dukes of Eden shall be amazed in the Mighty Man of Moab trembl Shake take shall take hold upon them all the inhabitants of Canaan shall Melt Away now in this verse fear and dread shall fall upon them by the greatness of thy arm they shall be as still as Stone till thy people pass over oh Lord till the people pass over which thou Hast purchased when I was reading this there was something that struck me and the thing that specifically struck me is the part where it says the greatness of thy arm they shall be as still as Stone till thy people pass over and when I was reading I was like this remind me of something this remind me of um of Revelation The Book of Revelation and that's this is actually the other part because when I was younger um I would read the Bible and I would do research on archangels and stuff right and sometime when I see this Archangel I see their description and all that and I'm like hm maybe when I get older I'll name my son this this and the third you know and but there was something specific that I noticed about Archangel Michael they said that he was the commander the commander of the army of the Lord you see and I was like that's cool that is very cool then one time I work with my boss when we were talking we're talking he told me that well there were Jehovah witnesses that says that Michael the Archangel Michael is Jesus and I was like H that's interesting then he was like I asked them for the scripture then they never gave me and I was like oh I never denied it I never accepted it but within the same week a minister came in and preached on Wednesday and mentioned Michael being Jesus Michael being Christ and I was like that's very interesting I said amen and then the following Sunday the pastor also mentions it I was like all right after service I went to the pastor I asked him well can you tell me how uh Christ is how Michael is Christ and the pastor asked me where did you hear that and I'm like you just preached about it and so instead of giving me the answer he just gave me the scriptures to go to and if you go to um if you go to Daniel chapter if you go to Daniel chapter 12 if you go to Daniel chapter 12 it says this and at that time shall Michael stand the great Prince which standed for the children of th people because everybody's familiar with the Battle of uh what's it called the battle that everybody's familiar whenever uh what's it called if you look online everything people would tell you Michael is the great angel that casted out Satan from Heaven you know that casted out Satan from Heaven you will have like pictures like these in movies and and and shows and everything and people are talking about how oh Michael is this great angel that casted out um Satan from heaven and some people would even go on and create stories and they're like well God was about to get up and you know fight fight the devil and after Michael told God no sit down I will take care of it whenever I hear that I'm like that makes no sense because God is I have never seen in the scripture where God his people are going through a trial and he just sits there I have never seen that so that never settled down with me and when they say oh Michael is the uh what's it called the commander-in chief and I'm like God is a jealous God why would he let someone be in charge of his people and as I as I was reading the scripture in uh Daniel chap 12:1 it says at that time shall Michael stand up the great Prince the only one that I know that's the prince of Prince the king of King is Jesus which standeth for the children of thy people and when I read that was like the only person that comes to mind that sto for the children of God is God himself right Jesus sto for the children of God he stole for them at Calvary he stole for them and defeated every type of sin possible it was Christ himself who stoed for the children of God that's what I got when I was reading that scripture and brother Brenham also said in beginning the be in beginning and ending of the Gentile dispensation and at that time Michael stand Michael shall stand the great Prince Michael was Christ of course who fought the Angelic Wars in heaven with the devil Satan and Michael fought together or fought against each other ra rather see when I was reading that and I was like um Michael Christ Michael is Christ Michael is uh representing Christ in in this battle that mean Christ was the one God himself was the one who actually casted Out the Devil because God will not sit down as you're going through a trial and just sit down and not do anything he also he's doing his part he wants you to do your part but he will also do his part he's not just going to stand there and people um going and causing chaos in your life without him doing anything and as as I was saying when I asked the uh Pastor I was like oh how is Christ uh Michael and stuff like that and he gave me the Book of Daniel and the Book of Revelation because both both those two books are parallel to each other and if you go to verse four it speaks about how Daniel was told to shut up the book and if you go to Revelation chapter 10 ver4 it also tells John just to close the book to seal up the book you see and if you go down to um to verse if you go down to um if you go down to verse uh five it says then I Daniel looked and behold there stood other two the one on one side in the of the bank the of the river and the other on the other side of the banker River and one said to the men clothed in linen which was upon the Waters of of the river how long shall it be to end these uh wonders and if you remember in also in Revelation he also speaks about how what's it called Christ the Revelation the angel that John me was also standing upon the water and he had one foot on the sea and one foot on the land and brother Brenham excuse me brother brenon has said I think I think of when Daniel was standing there on the banks on the on that when he was standing on the on um on the banks that day he saw the vision and the angel come down clothed in Sun a rainbow over his head he put one land had one for on the land one on the sea and raised up his hand and swore by him that lives forever and ever that time shall be no more you see that got to happen one of these day you see and I believe it's like happening this day right here because if you look at this two scripture I put it here to make it easier for comparison I'll try to save time by not reading too much but if you look at the two scripture in uh Revelation chapter 10 where say the angel which I saw stand upon the sea and upon the Earth lifted up his hand to Heaven see if you look at what's it called um scriptures they're like Puzzles you're going to find one piece of the puzzle here and after the other piece of the puzzle will be somewhere else and if you go back to verse 7 of Daniel 12 it says the man clothed in linen which was upon the waters of the river when when he held up his right hand and his left hand are to Heaven see one place it says one it doesn't say uh what's it called it seems like it says one hand the other scripture says both hand see it's like the puzzles that he showing you to to have the whole picture of Christ you see and as I was reading this because I will connect this back to our scripture that we're reading um in Exodus 15:6 as I was reading this it says one foot upon the sea and one foot upon the Earth and and when when you remember in uh what's it called if you go to Revelation chapter 13 if you remember there were the beast in verse chapter 13 verse1 the Beast that had came out the first Beast that had came out that brother Brenham say represented Rome and Rome had uh what's it called had the Antichrist spirit with him he had the spirits of denomination uh uh what's it called demonic Powers religious powers and um and political Powers you see because it says and I stood up I stood upon the sand of the sea and saw a beast rise up out of the sea having seven heads and 10 horns horns representing powers and 10 and upon his horns 10 crowns which represent dominions and upon his heads the name blasphemy and if you drop down to verse 11 it says and beheld another Beast coming up out of the earth and he had two horns like a lamb and he spoke as a dragon and if you notice uh what's it called the two beast in the scripture he never said the two Beast uh what's it called it never said the second beast spoke with the dragon if you notice in the Scripture it never said this the second beast like spoke with the with the dragon and if you're reading with brother brandham brother brandham says here the Little Beast the lamb that come up out of the water out of water not thickness and multitudes of people not out of out of the water brother B is henting you that the multitudes of people is representing water water in the Bible represents the multitude of people brother br's hting it to you where there's no one I had two little horn civil and ecclesiastic powers and he was a lamb freedom of religion see he's canting on to you that the lamb the freedom of religion is the America because if you remember the America they say they believe in freedom of speech freedom of religion and Etc he's handing you that's that's America and after a while they went together and he spoke like the Dragon see this is talking about the second beast in the Scripture it doesn't say that the second beast met the dragon but you find here that the second beast and the first Beast as they were communing the second beast started to speak like the dragon that's why the word of God had came here many times and say you need to watch the company that you hang around with because the company that you're hanging around with have influence over your life you might be hanging around with people of the world and you think it's not going to affect you but at some point don't be shocked or surprised when you start speaking the language of the devil you see because you're hanging too close with people that are going contrary to the word of God you say well I will be all right but you're being unequally Yol you will notice at some point your language will start to change and you'll start mimicking them your language will start to change you'll start mimicking them you start following the way they dress you start following the way they talk you'll start following the way they even stare and look at certain things your interest and their interest will start to align and you will find yourself deviating away from God because brother brandom said once again this second beast never actually spoke with the dragon but we found over here that he's speaking as the dragon and we found out that the dragon had poured himself on the first Beast you see now by the second beast and the first Beast having Fellowship both of them became one they were one Accord you see and brother Brandon continues and says he spoke like the dragon and exercised all the power that Rome did before him see when your hanging around certain people you will also start acting like them so don't be surprised when you're acting like them why because the company that you carry the company that you hang around you see sometime parents are asking themselves they they raise their child in the in the fear of the Lord and after the child goes to school and after the child comes home and after the child isn't acting right and sometime it's not even the parents uh what's it called the parents fault it's the company that they're meeting at school the company that they're hanging around the little friend groups that they're creating you see and the prophet continues that's coming to our nation to mark it down you watch to the confederation of the churches and the Catholic unit unite together and watch that take place people who follow the pillar of fire will certainly have a rough time see brother brandham didn't say um brother brandham didn't said that oh a Christian's life is easy Jesus also never said a Christian's life is easy he said there will be people that will persecute you they will hate you because of Christ and brother brenon is also saying that Christians will have a rough time you see Christians will have a rough time but and he proceeds says but they're ready they're ready for translation at that time that's right it's just ready although you're going through a rough time because we're in the last age and where everything it's hard everything even even the third world war is right around the corner you don't know when it's going to hit you see we're going through a rough time and the bride is ready if you're not ready you need to get ready soon because the Rapture is around is right around the corner you see brother Brenham continues and he says for the lamb overcome them see the lamb overcome them said the Bible and them that followed him because they were called The Chosen and the faithful and the elected of God see because God who overcame them God he already uh conquered he he did all that he needed to do in Calvary he displayed and showed you when God came down he came down to demonstrate how he can overcome sin and how you can overcome sin because if God overcame sin as as uh the in his divine nature you would say well he is God you know I can't do that because he's God see I'm in flesh I bleed God doesn't bleed so God came down as a human to bleed and to show you that even though you're bleeding you can still overcome you see even though you're going through some trials and even though you might fall even though you might sleep but you need to wake up and when you wake up you have to speak the word you see you can't just be sleeping forever and I want and I want to bring this back to where we were reading in Exodus chapter 15 verse 16 because if you go back to that where it says fear fear and dread shall fall upon them by the greatness of thy arm they shall they shall be as still as Stone see God is holding the powers you see God is holding the powers that's why they're still as Stone they're still a stone because God is holding them down so you can pass through you see if you remember earlier God has purchased us he had already paid the price that mean he he purchased the map he gave us the map he didn't stop by just giving us the map after he gave us the map he also led us he's guiding us to go to the destination and he didn't just stop at guiding us so we can arrive at their destination God also gave God also um after purchasing the map after guiding us so we can arrive at the destination he's also holding down the forces so they will not harm us kind of how job when job was going through his trials God was holding the devil he said he can touch everything but do not touch job's Soul do not go and touch that part God is holding the devil alth they're attacking they will not reach you although they're fighting as hard as they can all they can do is bark but they can't really bite you and and he proceeds Thou shalt bring them in and plant them in the mountain see it's God who's bringing you in and planting you in the mountain of your inheritance it's God who's guiding you remember it's arise soldiers of of the Cross God's ro we're talking about God's position in this journey God's God's Divine position in this journey and how he's helping us get through it and in verse 17 said Thou shalt bring them in and plant them in the mountain of thy inheritance in the place oh Lord which thou has made for thee to dwell in the sanctuary oh Lord which thy hands have established remember God does not dwell in a man-made building he dwelt in his own building that he built which Heaven is consist of the word that he built it by the word it's him himself brother BR say heaven is himself and God is bringing us to him he's guiding us to go into him and become one with him that's why in Revelation when people go in you go into the sea you go into the throne and after you disappear because you go into that realm of God you go into that reality of God you going to your your destination your inheritance and in verse 18 the the Lord shall reign forever and ever see it's the Lord because it's God's road for the horse of of pharaoh went went in with his chariots and with his Horsemen into the sea and the Lord brought them brought again the Waters of the sea upon them but the children of Israel went on dry land in the midst of the sea you see when all this um destruction are happening where all all your enemies are trying to fight you in fact your enemies themsel are also going through trials you see but Al what everybody's going through trials God is protecting your soul God is protecting you so you don't need to you don't need to envy your neighbor you don't need to Envy someone else you don't need to Envy especially people that are in denomination people that are backl you do not you do not need to Envy them because God is protecting you God himself said that he is protecting you and he is watching over you and he's even blocking the spirits of the devil because if you remember in Jesus prayer when he was praying for the um where he was praying for his disciples he changed that he also prayed for us and he was like I pray that you may not take them out of this world by protect them against the forces of this world you see he prayed that he may protect you against the forces the evilness the darkness in this world you see and in verse um 20 and Miriam the prophetes this the sister of Aaron took a TR tremble in in her hand and all the woman went out after her with the tremble and and with dances and Miriam answered them sing ye to the Lord for he ha triumphed gloriously the horse and his rider have he thrown into the sea you see all of this the horse and his rider remember the P horse rider all of those R the Antichrist Spirits he took all of them bind them up all and that they burn them all and threw them in the um in the Lake of Fire you see God has already this is God's plan this is God's um role in your life he's protecting you he is guiding you he's leading you and he's also holding up off the enemies from taking [Music] [Applause] you and I'll just read this scripture uh I'll read this verse from Brother brandham as like a closer because I know I can't get to the part where where I talk about all R because there's a lot but I want to close with this one if you couldn't catch anything that was spoken but I want you at least remember this one brother Brenham said and stand still and see the salvation of the Lord 1957 paragraph 28 29 he says it's not your battle just stand still remember it's just stand still it's God's battle don't be flustered that mean don't be agitated don't be quick to excuse me don't be quick to get mad to to feel like quitting just because stuff are going um it's not going according to your plan just stand still and listen to God don't be upset brother bham says stand still we're living in a tremendous time as we're living in a tremendous time right now we're living in a great time the church should stand still now to receive the promise see the promise of God is coming left and right and for you to to receive it is the prophet is saying stand still to receive the promise of God because the promise is already yours God promised it to you that you don't even have to work hard to achieve or to receive that promise that God already gave onto you you see it says stand still and watch the glory of God he's not the I was he's not that I was he is the I am he is the same he will just stand still as they did the I am the same that I am lives tonight see the I Am which is God because I am means Jehovah je Jehovah which Jehovah also means I'm becoming because he is he is the same yesterday today and forever and the I am is the present since we're speaking about today we're speaking about our time God is still the same now just stand still if you're facing a trial you're facing something just stand still and wait upon the Lord you see I remember even me when when uh when I meditate usually I meditate on let's say before the pastor asked me to preach sometime when I'm walking and God give me like a subject and I'm like all right I will meditate upon this and as I meditate upon this God will give me um inspiration and stuff and I will drop drop it down drop it down drop it down write it down and sometime when the pastor calls me not sometime like almost every time when the pastor calls me and says oh you're going to preach it's like as the time arrives for me to preach it's almost like if the devil tries to attack me and I try to look at my notes I'm like I took all these not I I don't even know how these notes fit in together I'm looking at I'm like Lord God I feel like quitting sometime but then I remember I wasn't the person who came up with the inspiration for this God who had given me that inspiration so what I proceed to do is I I end up standing still sometime I'd go to the car and be in my bedroom and I would just meditate upon what he gave me I said Lord God you inspired you gave this inspiration to me uh when you gave it to me they were good they made me happy I was happy as I was studying but now it's time for me to organize them to give it to your bride please help me organize it for your bride and when I keep that mentality of standing still and waiting upon the Lord the Lord start telling me put this here put this here put this there put this here put this here put this there and my message to you is you're a soldier of God and you as you're going through your battles just rely upon the Lord stand still rely upon the Lord because it's God's role it's God who's doing God who's working through you he's the one who started the work of Faith he's the one who started R of Faith he's the one who started and he's the one who's going to finish it for he is the arthor and he is the he is the finisher of our faith you see God purchased us and he bought the map gave us the map and he didn't stop at just giving us the map he he also uh led us he started guiding us showing us the marks in the map saying this this this this go here go there go left and when you want to try to go right he says no no go left maybe you're praying to go um right and God is telling you no go left you see because sometime we pray and we want to go a certain direction God changes our Direction you see God is telling you just follow through obedience you're following through obedience and as you're following through obedience God is holding down the forces from completely taking you out and he's bringing you to his holy habitation which is him himself he's bringing you back to him to the Glorious um marriage of the Bride may the Lord God bless you all this evening if we could all go to the Lord in prayer if we could all stand so we could go to the Lord in prayer Lord Heavenly Father we come to we come onto you this evening Lord God we thank you Lord Heavenly Father for this service we thank you for the word that was being preached we thank you for every Revelation that was spoken Lord Heavenly Father we thank you for it through it all Lord Jesus Christ we love Lord Jesus Christ for everything that you're doing in our age for everything the way you're shaping us the way that you're guiding us Lord God you're guiding Us by Your Word Lord heavenly father in this in this last age Lord God where it seems like there's no hope Lord God you're still there you're our strength that's guiding us Lord Heavenly Father you are anchor Lord Heavenly Father you have chosen us to run the race Lord Jesus Christ and when you have chosen us to run the race you said go and your go is not just oh I will go by myself but you're coming with us Lord Jesus Christ as we saw in the scripture you you you purchased us Lord Jesus Christ and you're guiding us Lord heavenly father to the destination you're not just someone that you're not like uh someone that would just like your boss or supervisor that might tell you oh go get this this and this that they're just sitting at their office Lord heavenly father but you're someone that says go get this and as we're going to get it Lord Heavenly Father you're walking with us you're talking with us you're telling us how to achieve it Lord Heavenly Father you're telling us Lord heavenly father in a walk in a walk to arrive at your holy habitation Lord God you're telling us to live certain things Lord God to live certain people live certain friend groups Lord Heavenly Father leave certain atmosphere live certain habits Lord God and just focus on you Lord God and you're guiding us through the strength of your word so we can arrive at you Lord heavenly father so he can reflect you so he may become like you Lord heavenly father and I pray Lord God anything that I may have left out behind may come in and may you fill in the gaps in between for your bride Lord heavenly father and I pray that they may understand it in fullness Lord God I thank you for the service I thank you for everything that you've been doing in our life Lord God I thank you for the message Lord Jesus Christ it's like every single time we reading the same scripture yet there's many more that comes over your Prophet said Lord Heavenly Father we can take one word one verse one scripture Lord God and he can unfold for eons Lord heavenly father and we pray that you may continue to unfold yourself until the Rapture comes Lord God Lord but Lord God as we stand still Lord Heavenly Father we're not just sitting Lord God we also have our part and I pray Lord heavenly father that you you may help us do our part which our part is through obedience Lord Heavenly Father help us obey your word Lord Heavenly Father help us Lord Jesus Christ chip chip away the things that are not of you Lord Jesus Christ so we may reflect you in all things in Jesus Christ's name I pray amen [Applause] [Music] praise God Amen am Glory Glory Glory Glory to God you got something to go about at at home amen watch your fellowship watch who you hanging around with amen remember this battle this journey is of god amen amen God is the one who started the journey he's the one that is protecting us he's the one leading us holding all the power of the devil until we make it to the other side can you give me five minutes yes sir amen I know there was something that was spoken here but I want to help somebody can you give me five minute if you recall I gave you a key on Sunday maybe couple Sunday ago and I mentioned that uh this is a great key and I say that probably you won't even understand it now but as you move on you will begin to understand this little by little amen he preached good so just focus on me this is something as a pastor I'm speaking and I told you that the scripture have no contradiction and I say whenever you see a scripture like it's contradicting each other there's usually a strong Revelation that is hidden there and I say the same thing apply for the message of br br the message has no contradiction brother Bram says that man was the third person of the Trinity not the Holy Spirit but man are we together and brother Bram later on say that the word Trinity is not even in the Bible sir are we together so here brother Bram is saying something here brother Bram is saying something brother Bram is not contradicting itself there is only one God and his name is the Lord Jesus Christ here oh Israel the Lord your God is how many God and brother Bram say when we speak about Father Son and Holy Ghost these are offices of one God Amen so God when he was dealing with Israel in the Old Testament that was the office of the father then when God was D I mean was pour into Jesus Christ God now became a son he became Emmanuel I even explained it here on the board Emmanuel which mean God with us but when God leave because said that everything that was in God he poured that into Christ in the second office not the second person the second office then everything that was in the second office when the ministry was finished he poured that back again into the Brad which is the church and it started on the day of Pentecost are we together so now I'm going to reread that quote again in case someone has a question brother Bram says this and that I gave it to you and show us the father brother Bram say and then he says there is no man to te the soil so he created men out of the dark brother bam is talking about men he created man he's not talking about the Holy Spirit he's talking about man the human being Adam and then and then he say and then he created man Out of the Dust of the earth that was Adam now he might have given a hand like a monkey and a foot like a bear I don't know what he did but he put him in five senses and he put this supernatural being which was called man the third person of the Trinity so it is not the Holy Spirit who is the third person of the trinity in other word because we need to understand what Bram Me Trinity is not in the Bible Trinity comes from Catholic Trinity is a false Doctrine but brother Bram is making a point if not you will miss the Revelation the Revelation is not that we believe in Trinity no the Revelation is what is brother Braham trying to say because brother Braham say take me for a dment get what I was trying to say because when he was the father that was God above us when he was the son it was Jesus Christ himself that's why Jesus say it is expedient for me to go because as long as I'm staying here I'm the one doing almost everything amen but in the third office Amen in the third office the manifestation of the holy spirit that doesn't belong to Jesus Christ it belong to the bride which is many members body in other word when brother Bram is saying man is the third person brother Bram is telling us that the third office of God the third manifestation of God into this world is going to be in human being which is the bre of Jesus Christ so Trinity is not in the Bible Trinity is a Catholic word but brother Bram is trying to make a point here to make us understand that at the beginning he was God the pillar of fire one day God became became flesh in one man now God is made flesh not in one man I gave you the quote in the unveiling of God he said in Jesus Christ is was God in one man now it's God in many men that third manifestation sir this is what brother brandham is calling the third person of the Trinity because the trouble in the message we argue in terms but we don't see the thoughts behind the term when I'm reading the third manifest the third person of the Trinity I already know that we don't believe in Trinity I already know that brother brandham doesn't believe in Trinity I already know that if somebody is a PhD in this message that understand the D of Jesus Christ is message believer I already understand that God is one God but I'm trying to catch what is the prophet saying why is God why is the prophet calling man the third person of a trinity is God is Man and another person in the Trinity so we have this this this no it is the same God he was the father above us now he became God in Jesus Christ now in his third office his third manifestation he is now God working in man so the Holy Spirit it is not the the third person of the Trinity that is heathenism that is caring God in pieces are we together so when you read brother Bram he might use one term here one term there there is no contradiction in the message read between the line because if this message is so plain that everybody can catch it the devil will catch the message but God sometime does brother Bram say God Jesus was speaking things purposely to make other people go that's why when you get in the crazy website they will try to show you brother Bram contradicting himself because they thought brother brandham was contradicting himself brother brandham was not contradicting himself God made it so that whoever is not predestinated for this message can go but if you a predestinated seed even if somebody trouble you one day the light will strike you and you will look around you say wait a minute these people were lying these people on the internet were lying now I see the light that's why we don't lose hope for our children we know that one of these day all it takes is for God to shine the light and before you know it they see it and they can understand but it's normal for you to go through the message and you see one thing here and one thing on the other way you see one thing before 63 one thing after 63 I heard people talking about marriage and divorce I can take marriage and divorce from before 63 and tired all the way to 65 sir because the way they say Okay marriage and divorce is in 65 this is the best marriage and divorce and they throw every other coat away no you don't understand the message before I get to 65 because the message was coming in progression I need to start from there and get everything and put it together the way somebody asked me say how do you study the message I say the way I study the message if I see a subject with brother brandham yeah and brother brandham say something I will go into the message and kill it yeah you won't believe this but I'm going to tell you and sometime it comes up like 2,500 quotes what do you think your pastor do does do you know what I do it takes me three to four days I have to go to every single one of them I told the minister he said but stepen I cannot do that I said that's you but me I'm built that way sometime you hit it and it's going to be 4,000 and I have to go through 4,000 quot maybe might take me a week I have to go one after the other then I pull all of them together then I sit down to see why is brother brandham giving all of this then I can pull it together when we were in the ComEd when the brother were talking I said did you read it in the message I said did you read the Cote about oh no no no no no uh what was it it was like an entering Pastor I said show me one coat I say I read this through the message I sat with more than a thousand code I didn't see anything like this why because the message was put in a strategic way so that the seed of the devil cannot see so when I read Trinity I know Trinity is of Satan I Trinity came from the devil I know Trinity came from the Catholic church and I see here a revelation hidden and brother Bram take the word Trinity and put it there so when I look I just take Trinity and I flip it up and I enter under I say this is not Trinity he's talking about men being in the office of the holy spirit because it's now God working in men any question my friend let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we are approaching you humbly tonight father we thank you for your grace for your love and your mercy and for everything you have been doing for us father thank you for speaking for us because you taught us
