[46:27] and the ending of this service and bless
[46:30] your children and those that are still
[46:32] on the road coming father may you
[46:34] protect them and give them to our Mercy
[46:37] we commit it all unto th hand father in
[46:39] the name of Jesus Christ amen
[46:43] amen the Bible says and the Lord spoke
[46:46] to Moses go to pharaoh and say to him
[46:50] thus says the Lord let my people go that
[46:54] they may serve me everybody okay and if
[46:58] you refuse to let them go behold I will
[47:02] smart all your borders with frogs yes
[47:06] Lord and the rivers shall bring forth
[47:09] frog abundantly which shall go up and
[47:12] come into your house and into your bed
[47:15] chamber and upon your bed and into the
[47:18] house of your servant and upon your
[47:21] people into your ovens and into your
[47:24] needing throw meaning your balls and the
[47:27] Frog shall come up both on you and upon
[47:30] your people and upon all your servant
[47:34] and the Lord spoke to Moses saying to
[47:36] Aaron say to Aaron stretch forth your
[47:38] hand with your road over the streams of
[47:41] the rivers and over the ponds and cause
[47:44] frog to come up upon the land of Egypt
[47:47] and Aaron stretched out his hand over
[47:50] the Waters of Egypt and the frogs came
[47:53] up and cover the land of Egypt
[47:57] and The Magicians did so with the
[48:01] enchantment and brought up frogs upon
[48:06] the
[48:09] land amen
[48:14] amen when we read
[48:17] scripture like
[48:19] this the way I just
[48:22] read we come up with all kind of ideas
[48:26] yes
[48:27] we just read it together so at the end
[48:31] you have an idea of what we were reading
[48:34] and if I ask several of you right here I
[48:37] say what did you read you would tell me
[48:40] Moses went to pharaoh and when he went
[48:43] to Pharaoh God told him let my people go
[48:48] and he spoke to Pharaoh he said Pharaoh
[48:50] let my people go if you refuse I'm going
[48:53] to send frog and Moses brought up the
[48:56] Frog and the magician also did the same
[48:59] thing and they brought up the frog that
[49:02] is what everybody will
[49:03] say Amen we will say it in the message
[49:07] amen and outside of the message but
[49:11] that's not the
[49:14] case that's not really what the Bible is
[49:19] saying and the people take this and they
[49:21] make
[49:24] movie amen am here we say amen and the
[49:29] people make movie and they make cartoons
[49:32] and all we know we will see Moses and
[49:35] Aaron bringing for frogs and then the
[49:38] magician also creating frogs so this one
[49:41] is bringing this one is bringing and
[49:43] that's what we have that's not what the
[49:45] scripture says break it down
[49:48] it are we together amen are we together
[49:52] amen we are dealing with the five
[49:54] garments of Joseph and amen and we are
[49:58] still in the Garment of a slave or a
[50:01] servant and we went through Jesus Christ
[50:04] we took Elijah we took uh Elisha we took
[50:08] uh uh what is his name we took Paul we
[50:11] took David we took Joshua we took Israel
[50:14] we took Rebecca we took zipora Rachel
[50:17] all these and we landed on Moses right
[50:21] amen when we landed on Moses we found
[50:24] that Moses first started as a prince
[50:28] amen amen and when he was a PR a prince
[50:31] in Egypt the Bible say he was m in
[50:35] words you remember that brother Greg
[50:38] pred up to me and he was also Mighty in
[50:41] Deeds this word here he was mighty in
[50:46] speech amen and if Moses was mighty in
[50:50] speech in Egypt that's what when God
[50:53] asked him let me send you back to Egypt
[50:57] why was he having a problem with his
[51:01] tongue when he come to the word you are
[51:03] a champion amen when it comes to the
[51:06] things of God then we begin to back up
[51:08] I'm not worthy to do it again but in the
[51:11] world he was a m ined m in speech but
[51:16] when it comes to take responsibility or
[51:19] position of what God put him Moses
[51:22] backed
[51:23] up let's go so I told you keep your seat
[51:26] belt amen amen and then he moved from a
[51:29] prce he become a servant because he
[51:33] desired to be like a slave he become a
[51:36] servant to jro amen his father-in-law
[51:39] and from there in the Burning Bush
[51:41] brother Bram told us that he became a
[51:44] prisoner and then from there he have to
[51:47] go back
[51:49] again to appear before
[51:53] Pharaoh amen but when he goes to appear
[51:57] before Pharaoh he's going to be a
[52:03] God so God Was preparing Moses to become
[52:07] a
[52:09] God can you say amen amen the problem is
[52:13] all of this you will agree with me you
[52:15] will accept it without any problem when
[52:17] it comes to a God you got a problem
[52:20] thank God he was written in the Old
[52:23] Testament I didn't write it you didn't
[52:26] write it my parent didn't write it your
[52:28] parent didn't write it so we know it's
[52:30] the word of God and Heaven and Earth
[52:32] will pass away by the word of God will
[52:35] never pass away so the the the hardest
[52:38] thing we have is Moses taking his
[52:41] position as a
[52:45] god brother Bram say God would have
[52:48] healed him of his speech
[52:50] impediment amen but he doubted and
[52:54] turned it to his brother
[52:57] amen so now we hear the God is sent to
[53:01] pharaoh and according to what he what we
[53:04] read we found out that hey he spoke to
[53:07] Pharaoh Pharaoh didn't listen they
[53:10] brought up frog the magician did the
[53:12] same thing and that's what we have in
[53:14] movie that's what we' seen in Jehovah
[53:16] witness's
[53:18] books that's what we have in cartoons
[53:21] but that's not the case that's wrong
[53:25] come on come on
[53:27] brother Bram says that in the exposition
[53:30] of the church ages that but as usual
[53:34] when one regard a verse
[53:39] superficially amen amen he comes up with
[53:42] what a superficial understanding this is
[53:46] very
[53:47] serious it's simple but it's serious
[53:51] meaning if you look or you have a
[53:54] knowledge of something superficially
[53:58] amen you will even behave based on The
[54:02] Superficial understanding you
[54:05] reing I don't know if you're getting me
[54:08] if you know a woman
[54:11] superficially you will treat her based
[54:13] on The Superficial
[54:15] knowledge to you she might be just a
[54:18] human being sir you don't understand
[54:21] that this is somebody that God created
[54:24] in his own image
[54:27] and God own likeness and if you lack
[54:30] that understanding to really understand
[54:33] who she is you're going to treat her any
[54:35] kind of way you going to be her any kind
[54:39] of
[54:39] way a super fici understanding goes with
[54:43] a superficial
[54:46] life and the same thing happen in
[54:48] message churches we all read the prophet
[54:53] but the understanding is different and
[54:56] depending on the level of understanding
[54:59] whether the church understand the
[55:02] prophet
[55:03] superficially or in the deepness of what
[55:06] the prophet is saying and if the church
[55:09] understand the prophet superficially
[55:11] your life will go no higher than your
[55:15] understanding can you say
[55:18] Amen brother Bram says this glory to God
[55:22] we already prayed so I'm sorry brother
[55:24] Bram says this in the bless said Jesus
[55:27] Christ the same yesterday today and
[55:28] forever brother Bram say usually in a
[55:32] meeting it should be three night of
[55:37] teaching I'm reading brother Bram it
[55:40] should be how many nights of teaching
[55:42] three night so before brother brandham
[55:44] prays for the sick brother brandham have
[55:47] to teach the audience three night in the
[55:52] room but look what we doing that's why
[55:54] people don't get healed
[55:57] because they they only cut into a
[56:00] superficial understanding which will
[56:03] produce a superficial
[56:05] Faith a faith that work for sometime and
[56:09] when the devil begin to challenge you
[56:11] you are not granded in the word you
[56:15] don't have grand you don't have solid
[56:18] root in the word and before you know it
[56:21] your healing begin to be doubted and
[56:24] nothing happened to you amen and brother
[56:27] Bram said before he goes to start
[56:29] praying he goes three night teaching the
[56:33] church bringing the church back down to
[56:36] the scripture to the word of God
[56:42] first didn't I tell you keep your seat
[56:45] belt glory to God brother Bram say it
[56:48] should be three night of teaching before
[56:51] we even have a what a prayer line wow
[56:58] we preach 45
[57:00] minutes we preach 25 minutes and you
[57:04] start praying for the sick because we
[57:07] have inserted a
[57:09] story that plays with the emotions of
[57:12] the
[57:13] people and before you know it the people
[57:16] begin to feel pity and they begin to
[57:19] come to the altar to be prayed for all
[57:21] of that is
[57:23] superficial they don't have a real
[57:26] fa real faith when they teach three
[57:30] night you won't wait for the prayer
[57:35] line when the teaching goes the first
[57:38] night the second night before they even
[57:41] get to the third night somebody will
[57:44] leave the whe chair because they begin
[57:47] to understand the purpose of God and the
[57:50] Very thought of God about the situation
[57:55] [Applause]
[57:56] my people
[57:58] suffer for lack of
[58:01] [Music]
[58:02] knowledge everybody okay everybody okay
[58:06] brother Bram say because why do you do
[58:10] that because many time as these days
[58:15] especially when people who are
[58:18] not may be what T just in the what the
[58:23] Deep things
[58:28] can you say Amen so there is two kind of
[58:31] a
[58:34] teaching hallu they can teach you
[58:37] superficial
[58:39] things amen amen or they can teach you
[58:43] deep
[58:46] things amen and your faith
[58:49] [Music]
[58:51] depend the level of your faith the an
[58:56] gear of your faith the magnitude of your
[58:59] faith depend on where they granted
[59:04] youah if they Grant you on the first
[59:07] pole you won't go higher than
[59:10] that if the preacher can only Grant you
[59:13] on the second pool you won't go any
[59:16] higher than that but whoever is granted
[59:19] on the third pool the third pool is a
[59:23] package of the first and the second pool
[59:28] are we
[59:31] together brother brandham say this day
[59:35] especially when people who are not may
[59:38] be taught just in the what the Deep
[59:41] things of this great move of God in the
[59:45] past 40 years that swept around the
[59:47] world they might not understand just
[59:50] right because of lack of teaching and
[59:53] they come just a little critical of what
[59:57] or something so when people criticize
[1:00:01] things sometime it's not their
[1:00:05] fault they were not t
[1:00:08] right that's why they criticize things
[1:00:12] that's why Jesus told the woman at the
[1:00:14] if you know who's asking
[1:00:16] you you know if you have an
[1:00:19] understanding of who is asking you
[1:00:22] instead of me asking you what you will
[1:00:25] be the one asking me the water of life
[1:00:28] but lack of understanding you are you
[1:00:31] are you are you are living without
[1:00:33] restrain you are even criticizing the
[1:00:36] very work of
[1:00:39] God and you're going to find yourself
[1:00:41] fighting against
[1:00:43] God amen Amen brother Bram said they
[1:00:46] might not understand just right and they
[1:00:48] come just a little critical of something
[1:00:51] or may be no wanting to be but not
[1:00:54] understanding what the word so you can
[1:00:56] imagine what a job it will be for who
[1:00:59] the Holy Spirit to do what to press that
[1:01:02] into hearts at at what night in other
[1:01:05] words even God have a hard time to use
[1:01:08] one night to press faith into people
[1:01:11] because of lack of teaching but teaching
[1:01:14] of the spirit make it easy for you to
[1:01:17] receive
[1:01:20] it are we together are we together are
[1:01:24] we together Paul says this in the book
[1:01:28] of First Corinthians chapter 2 he said
[1:01:30] but as it is written what I have not
[1:01:33] seen and nor ears have what heard
[1:01:36] neither have entered into the heart of
[1:01:38] what the things which God had prepared
[1:01:41] for them that do what that love him it's
[1:01:43] already prepared for you but how do we
[1:01:45] receive it but God had one revealed
[1:01:50] revealed them unto us by what his spirit
[1:01:52] for the spirit search what all things
[1:01:56] yeah the what the Deep things of God so
[1:01:59] to receive the Deep things of God you
[1:02:02] don't just need the
[1:02:05] message you might have the message and
[1:02:08] the books and the tap and still you
[1:02:10] don't receive the things of God you need
[1:02:13] the message and the god of the
[1:02:17] message you need the prophet and the
[1:02:20] pillar of fire because the god of the
[1:02:24] Prophet is the one that's spoke to the
[1:02:26] prophet holy man of God spoke moved by
[1:02:30] the spirit of God so to really
[1:02:33] understand what the spirit was speaking
[1:02:35] through the prophet you need to have the
[1:02:37] spirit that was speaking in the prophet
[1:02:40] to really grasp what God is saying if
[1:02:43] not you're going to say superficially
[1:02:46] and lose the very deep
[1:02:49] things and your faith won't be different
[1:02:52] than a
[1:02:54] Pentecostal amen amen amen amen for what
[1:03:00] man knoweth the things of men sayth the
[1:03:03] spirit of men which is where in him in
[1:03:05] other word how can I know what brother
[1:03:07] Benjamin is
[1:03:08] thinking it takes brother Benjamin to
[1:03:11] know what he's thinking so the only way
[1:03:13] you would know what brother Benjamin is
[1:03:15] thinking you need to have brother
[1:03:16] Benjamin spirit and how are you going to
[1:03:19] know the things of
[1:03:23] God it's it's one plus one equal to how
[1:03:27] are you going to know the things of God
[1:03:29] you we we have to break it down like
[1:03:32] this so he sink really deep brother Paul
[1:03:35] say even saw the things of who God Noth
[1:03:38] what no man but who the spirit of God so
[1:03:42] to get into the deep things you got to
[1:03:44] get the spirit of God amen amen you need
[1:03:48] a
[1:03:50] submarine to take you down in the word
[1:03:53] and that submarine is the holy ghost
[1:03:56] without the Holy Ghost you will read the
[1:03:59] message but you don't really catch the
[1:04:02] vision and your behavior will prove how
[1:04:05] where you are which level you are which
[1:04:08] depth you are with God the deeper you
[1:04:11] get with God the more sincere your life
[1:04:14] will change not deeper in knowledge but
[1:04:17] deeper in
[1:04:21] Revelation are we together are we
[1:04:24] together brother Bram says in the
[1:04:27] message testimony he said May something
[1:04:30] special happen
[1:04:31] tonight this morning just something out
[1:04:35] there that the H holy spirit will just
[1:04:37] fall over what the people in such a way
[1:04:40] till they just keep they just can't keep
[1:04:42] from receiving it how hardly Lord do
[1:04:45] what granted and may they have a what a
[1:04:48] deep understanding open up their heart
[1:04:51] and and understanding Lord to know that
[1:04:54] these things are on to what the glory of
[1:04:57] God and for the edifying of God Church
[1:04:59] which Jesus purchased with his own blood
[1:05:02] for we ask it in Jesus name what amen
[1:05:05] and I pray this is my prayer for all of
[1:05:07] us this morning so that we can
[1:05:10] understand what is God really telling us
[1:05:13] when he said that you are
[1:05:15] [Music]
[1:05:17] God are we together we coming back to
[1:05:21] our scripture we read and according to
[1:05:24] our scripture MOS Moes and Aaron went
[1:05:27] they produced frogs and the magician
[1:05:30] imitate or mimic them and they also
[1:05:33] produce frog and that's what the movie
[1:05:35] says now let's go back again and let's

[1:05:53] Lord spoke to Moses

[1:06:00] slowly I read with you quickly the way
[1:06:02] we read the Bible and we
[1:06:05] close and we think we got something
[1:06:08] superficial
[1:06:10] understanding amen and when they ask you
[1:06:13] a question after four or five weeks it's
[1:06:15] gone superficial understanding when it's
[1:06:18] a revelation it doesn't go
[1:06:21] anywhere amen amen if God reveal
[1:06:25] something in the scripture you won't
[1:06:27] forget it you will always remember that
[1:06:31] amen let's go and he say th sayth the
[1:06:35] Lord let my people go that they may
[1:06:38] serve me and if you refuse to let them
[1:06:42] go behold I will Smite all your borders
[1:06:47] with
[1:06:48] frogs watch now
[1:06:50] clearly and the river shall bring forth
[1:06:54] water

[1:07:09] river shall bring forth what
[1:07:15] FR that word the
[1:07:18] river singular shall do
[1:07:21] what
[1:07:23] bring forth in other words the river
[1:07:28] will
[1:07:31] produce are you following me or
[1:07:37] manufacture I'm going slowly
[1:07:42] now let me strike it hard oh
[1:07:51] create I'm going to go slowly I have to
[1:07:54] go 25 miles an hour so you get this
[1:07:57] soaked in okay how many people here have
[1:08:00] seen a pond yes a pond before maybe a
[1:08:04] river amen have you seen a river filled
[1:08:08] with
[1:08:09] frog have you ever seen a I mean a pond
[1:08:12] filled with frog even if you go there
[1:08:14] and you hear frog how many will you see
[1:08:17] only few of them but God needed
[1:08:22] frogs and God need a certain quantity of
[1:08:26] frogs and that quantity need to be in
[1:08:29] people
[1:08:32] house am I reading a different
[1:08:35] Bible they need to be in the oven when
[1:08:39] you open your oven frog must be
[1:08:42] there okay let's read it because when I
[1:08:45] begin to go this rout it looks like my
[1:08:47] Bible different than yours let's go my
[1:08:50] friend let's go and the river shall
[1:08:52] bring forth what frog how abund
[1:08:56] so it means those frog were not in
[1:09:00] abundance that's right are we together
[1:09:03] are we together in other words God is
[1:09:05] saying the river must produce a great
[1:09:08] quantity meaning that the frog that were
[1:09:11] in the river were not a great
[1:09:15] quantity true bring forth how abundantly
[1:09:19] let's go
[1:09:22] slowly abundantly what
[1:09:26] which shall go up and come into what
[1:09:29] thine house and into your what thy bed
[1:09:31] chamber and into what thy bed and into
[1:09:34] the house of who thy servant and upon
[1:09:36] who thy people and into your water thine
[1:09:39] oven and into your water thy needing
[1:09:42] even in the pen that you cooking with
[1:09:44] there must be frog there can a river
[1:09:47] produce such a frog look at the city of
[1:09:50] uh Gastonia I mean right here how many
[1:09:54] houses do we have
[1:09:56] do you think that River Kaba that is
[1:09:58] here have enough frog to fill one house
[1:10:01] and fill the second and fill the third
[1:10:03] and fill every single houses in Egypt
[1:10:06] amen it's telling you that some frog
[1:10:09] were
[1:10:12] created amen they were not enough frog
[1:10:16] to do the
[1:10:19] job are we there and God told Moses he
[1:10:22] said the river will bring forth
[1:10:25] the river will give
[1:10:29] birth amen it will produce it will
[1:10:33] manufacture frog abundantly I need a
[1:10:36] great manufacturer I need a great order
[1:10:39] God is making an order a frog because he
[1:10:43] want those frog to fill every house
[1:10:46] every bed chamber every everybody that
[1:10:50] is in Egypt frog must be in your house
[1:10:52] frog in the kitchen frog in the oven
[1:10:54] frog everywhere so the first part here
[1:10:58] is about the
[1:11:02] creation amen who is going to create
[1:11:08] that right here he said the
[1:11:12] river are we together it didn't tell us
[1:11:15] who
[1:11:17] spoke the river will do it let's go
[1:11:20] slowly drop to verse four and the Frog
[1:11:25] shall come up on both upon both of you
[1:11:30] and upon your people and upon your what
[1:11:33] Serv so number one is the production of
[1:11:37] fruits follow me
[1:11:40] carefully number two is the movement of
[1:11:45] frogs amen from the
[1:11:49] river amen unto the land you need to
[1:11:53] read the scripture slowly if not you
[1:11:56] will come up with your own conception of
[1:11:59] what the spirit say do you remember I
[1:12:01] told you that the pillar of fire last
[1:12:03] time the way the Jo it was like the
[1:12:05] pillar of fire was on top and we found
[1:12:08] out that I was wrong the pillar of fire
[1:12:10] covered the entire the cloud covered the
[1:12:13] entire Mountain so we need to change our
[1:12:16] concept our way of looking at the
[1:12:18] scripture and come back to the word of
[1:12:20] the hour amen so number one the the Frog
[1:12:25] are created and the manufactur the river
[1:12:28] is filled with them number two the Frog
[1:12:31] must move from the river and come up
[1:12:34] into the land to go to their destination
[1:12:37] the package must be
[1:12:39] delivered are we together jum to verse
[1:12:43] five and the Lord spoke to Moses say to
[1:12:47] Aaron do what stretch forth thine hand
[1:12:50] with your road over what the streams
[1:12:53] over what the rivers over what all the
[1:12:58] warehouses are we there amen over the
[1:13:00] river and over the ponds and do what and
[1:13:04] cause frog and create
[1:13:08] frogs and create
[1:13:10] frogs is that what the scripture say and
[1:13:14] cause frog to do what to come up Aaron
[1:13:17] was not creating
[1:13:20] [Music]
[1:13:22] frogs I'm going slowly there the road of
[1:13:25] Aaron when he was stretch out he was not
[1:13:28] to
[1:13:29] create the word of Aaron was stretch out
[1:13:33] to cause the
[1:13:35] frog that were already been created to
[1:13:39] move onto the
[1:13:41] land the same God that took the animal
[1:13:45] in the time of Noah and brought them
[1:13:47] into the ark he knows how to give frog
[1:13:51] signal and give them a GPS to tell them
[1:13:54] which house to go and which of to get
[1:13:58] into it and the Frog are obeying
[1:14:00] following God's GPS until they reach
[1:14:03] their destination and they do God's job
[1:14:07] number one it's a creation number two
[1:14:10] it's a moving of the frog from the river
[1:14:13] to the land and that moving was made by
[1:14:18] Aaron not Moses
[1:14:21] Aaron amen but who created the Frog
[1:14:27] are we together we okay together jump
[1:14:31] now to verse uh uh six and Aaron stretch
[1:14:36] we on six amen yes and Aaron stretched
[1:14:40] out his hand over the water of Egypt and
[1:14:44] frog did what came up frog were not
[1:14:48] created frog just begin the moving when
[1:14:52] Aaron do this all the Frog begin the
[1:14:54] moving it looks like everybody was
[1:14:56] waiting for Aon amen amen and the Frog
[1:15:00] came up are we there amen and covered
[1:15:03] the what the land of Egypt we
[1:15:06] clear and the magician did
[1:15:11] so what did the medician
[1:15:15] do because we got two things here follow
[1:15:19] me carefully we got the creation and the
[1:15:23] moving amen when the magician copy what
[1:15:28] did they
[1:15:30] copy do you see now now your now your
[1:15:34] eyes are changing amen did the magician
[1:15:37] also
[1:15:38] create now we begin to talk my friend
[1:15:42] now we begin to talk my friend we
[1:15:44] getting somewhere the Bible says and the
[1:15:47] magician did so when we read did so in
[1:15:51] our conception the magician also created
[1:15:53] frog but let let me help you up with
[1:15:56] this my friend brother Bram says in the
[1:15:59] message sir we would see Jesus brother
[1:16:02] brandham say see God is
[1:16:07] alone in
[1:16:09] creation when it comes to Creation it is
[1:16:12] God
[1:16:13] only so if you make a movie of magician
[1:16:17] bringing up frogs you are giving power
[1:16:21] to Satan to create
[1:16:25] we going slowly my friend you are God
[1:16:29] you are God you are God all of you are
[1:16:34] gods and the ability to create only
[1:16:39] remain in the hands of a
[1:16:42] God I'm going slowly my friend God's
[1:16:46] alone in what creation the devil can
[1:16:50] create if you say the devil can heal
[1:16:53] then you make him what Creator then he
[1:16:56] is how Co equal with God Only God Alone
[1:17:00] can do what create the devil can only do
[1:17:04] what pervert what is already what
[1:17:06] created so God is the only one that is a
[1:17:11] Creator only God who is a Creator amen
[1:17:16] if you make the devil a Creator you make
[1:17:19] him
[1:17:20] coequal Co equal Co equal in other word
[1:17:25] the devil is not coequal with
[1:17:29] God that's why what the magician did the
[1:17:33] magician did not manufacture the Frog
[1:17:37] they didn't bring forth the Frog but
[1:17:39] they just caused the
[1:17:41] Frog let's read it together let's read
[1:17:44] it together my friend amen amen let's go
[1:17:47] to verse seven and the magician did so
[1:17:51] did so what what Aaron just did God
[1:17:54] Aaron moved the Frog to the land and the
[1:17:58] magician did so in other words they
[1:18:02] repeated what Aaron did follow me
[1:18:05] carefully my friend amen and they did so
[1:18:09] which their what enchantment their
[1:18:11] enchantment that's why they can have a
[1:18:13] circus and play with a
[1:18:16] lion it's an
[1:18:18] enchantment it is not Noah bringing the
[1:18:21] lion into the ark that is God power what
[1:18:25] happened in the circus is a is a
[1:18:28] pervasion an
[1:18:30] impersonation amen from the devil that's
[1:18:33] why a message believer should not go to
[1:18:35] a
[1:18:36] circus wherever you take your children
[1:18:39] watch where you taking your
[1:18:42] children you don't take your children to
[1:18:45] sit down and watch magician tricks they
[1:18:48] are bewitching your children I don't
[1:18:51] care if it's in the fair watch which
[1:18:53] fair you going
[1:18:57] to are we together are we together are
[1:19:01] we together glory to God he says the
[1:19:04] magician did so with their what
[1:19:07] enchantments and brought up not bringing
[1:19:12] forth bringing up bringing up frogs upon
[1:19:17] what so what the magician copy is number
[1:19:22] two they only copy to move the Frog into
[1:19:26] the land but the magician were not able
[1:19:30] to create the Frog nor to remove the
[1:19:34] Frog they can even bring the Frog but
[1:19:36] when it comes to remove the Frog they
[1:19:38] can't remove it if you having hard time
[1:19:41] drop to verse
[1:19:44] 11 verse 11 if you thereare you can say
[1:19:46] amen amen and the Frog shall depart from
[1:19:49] where the from thee and from what thy
[1:19:53] houses and from what thy servants and
[1:19:55] from what thy people and shall remain in
[1:19:58] the what river only so they were also
[1:20:00] frog in the river even though there were
[1:20:03] frog in the land frog still remain in
[1:20:05] the river and those that remain in the
[1:20:08] river are those that some of those are
[1:20:11] those that the magician move from the
[1:20:13] river all the way there what are you
[1:20:15] trying to
[1:20:17] say jum to verse 16 if you dare you can
[1:20:21] say amen
[1:20:22] amen and the Lord said to Moses
[1:20:25] say to Aaron follow me stretch out your
[1:20:29] road and smite the dust do you follow
[1:20:35] me of the land that he may become what

[1:20:44] frog
[1:20:46] amen now we got life follow me carefully
[1:20:50] amen amen life throughout all the land
[1:20:54] of Egypt and they did
[1:20:57] so for Aaron stretched out his hand with
[1:21:01] a road and smok the dust of the earth
[1:21:05] and he became Li in man and in beast and
[1:21:09] all the dust of the land became what Li
[1:21:14] throughout what all the land of Egypt
[1:21:16] and the
[1:21:21] magician did so follow me carefully with
[1:21:26] their what enchantment to do what to
[1:21:29] bring forth watch that word bringing
[1:21:33] forth amen amen Aaron took the road
[1:21:37] Smite and the dust turn into a life if
[1:21:43] you don't understand what I'm saying
[1:21:45] when Jesus was
[1:21:49] hungry I hope you getting the devil came
[1:21:52] to Jesus Christ
[1:21:55] and say if you
[1:21:57] are a son of
[1:22:01] God and you are hungry take this Stone
[1:22:06] and do what turn it into bread flip it
[1:22:08] into a
[1:22:10] bread a Son of God can do
[1:22:15] that amen what the devil was telling
[1:22:19] Jesus Christ if putting a doubt because
[1:22:22] a Son of God is a God you remember that
[1:22:26] and he said if putting that you a Son of
[1:22:28] God prove to me because a Son of God can
[1:22:31] take something like this and
[1:22:33] Manufacturing do you follow me and back
[1:22:36] here God is telling Aaron take your road
[1:22:39] Smart in the dust when Aaron smoke every
[1:22:46] dust follow me
[1:22:48] carefully every
[1:22:50] dust amen amen became what life when we
[1:22:56] die and and we get buried in a coffin
[1:23:00] and we are buried in the cemetery after
[1:23:03] a while your body begin to get destroyed
[1:23:06] yes sir if they give you more time maybe
[1:23:10] 10 15 or 20 40 years what will happen to
[1:23:14] that body it will become
[1:23:19] what so your body came from the dust
[1:23:22] that's what the scripture say and God
[1:23:24] told Aon stuck the
[1:23:28] dust now you begin to get my friend not
[1:23:32] stuck the word strick the dust and let
[1:23:35] the dust become what it was a
[1:23:43] creation I don't know if we are together
[1:23:47] amen amen amen whatever happened came
[1:23:51] from the dust if you destroy it
[1:23:54] everything bring God back to the dust
[1:23:56] God told ad I mean Adam I pull you from
[1:23:59] the dust and you will return from the
[1:24:01] dust so if God want to create a loved
[1:24:04] one that passed 200 years ago all that
[1:24:07] God have to do is speak to the and the
[1:24:11] element your composition your formul is
[1:24:13] still preserved and your element will
[1:24:16] begin to come together and reproduce
[1:24:19] your body and God told Aaron go back to
[1:24:23] the Dust this is what I did with
[1:24:27] Adam before I created Adam in Genesis 2
[1:24:30] I formed him from the dust of the
[1:24:35] ground are we together are we together
[1:24:39] so God told Aon struck the desk and then
[1:24:43] it's going to be turned onto what light
[1:24:45] which is an action of what creation and
[1:24:48] the magician want to copy
[1:24:51] that let's see now job to Verse 18 and
[1:24:56] the
[1:24:57] magician did so with their what
[1:25:00] enchantments to bring forth what stop if
[1:25:04] you read right here you
[1:25:06] lost because brother Bram said the devil
[1:25:09] cannot
[1:25:11] create if you stop here you will think
[1:25:14] the magician
[1:25:16] created because the Bible said bring
[1:25:18] forth producing but let's continue the
[1:25:22] scripture my friend he says and the
[1:25:24] magician did so with their enchantment
[1:25:26] to bring forth FL
[1:25:30] but do you see that but in other word
[1:25:34] they
[1:25:36] try the magician try to create
[1:25:41] liall this is a creation right here if
[1:25:44] you don't understand me this is the
[1:25:46] third
[1:25:49] pool the magician try to impersonate the
[1:25:53] Third
[1:25:55] they tried to
[1:25:57] [Applause]
[1:25:59] create are we together are we together
[1:26:02] the Bible say but amen they could not
[1:26:07] for they were what light upon men and
[1:26:10] upon
[1:26:12] what they thought this is a cheap
[1:26:15] magician
[1:26:16] trick oh let's go ahead and do it they
[1:26:19] took it and struck nothing struck
[1:26:22] nothing struck nothing why is this not
[1:26:26] working when it's the moving of the Frog
[1:26:29] it's working but when it's Creation The
[1:26:32] Devil is
[1:26:33] locked because only
[1:26:37] God can
[1:26:40] create so there is an area where you can
[1:26:43] pass the border and the devil will never
[1:26:46] follow
[1:26:49] you if you stay on the first pool the
[1:26:52] devil can match you the second pool the
[1:26:55] devil can match you but if you are there
[1:26:58] pass the third Lon into the holiest of
[1:27:01] holy and you enter into the holiest
[1:27:05] under the third po no devil can enter
[1:27:08] there that is the real of the God you
[1:27:12] must have an
[1:27:14] identification of a god before you get
[1:27:18] there you show your ID I'm a God then
[1:27:20] the door open if you don't have a god
[1:27:23] chip
[1:27:25] a chap of God to use on the door that
[1:27:29] door will never open
[1:27:32] [Applause]
[1:27:34] up he won't open for the devil and his
[1:27:38] children but he will open for God and
[1:27:41] his
[1:27:44] children Aaron was able to do it but not
[1:27:48] the
[1:27:51] magician are we together I'm going
[1:27:54] slowly so we can sink this in are we

[1:33:49] flies this were Grievous it was another
[1:33:53] speech
[1:33:58] that was
[1:34:00] created

[1:34:06] these were Grievous so these were not
[1:34:08] only n
[1:34:10] flies do you follow me so these flies
[1:34:14] were also
[1:34:20] created are we together are we together
[1:34:24] let's go to Exodus chapter
[1:34:26] 10 Lord help me if you there you can say
[1:34:31] Amen Exodus 10
[1:34:37] verse2 you there amen and the Lord said
[1:34:41] to Moses stretch out your hand over the
[1:34:45] land of Egypt for the who the low
[1:34:49] priests we move from frogs created life
[1:34:54] created flies created do you see the
[1:34:57] magician coming back
[1:35:01] again do you see the magician again
[1:35:04] hallu do you see any magician there they
[1:35:06] learn that hey this is the Finger of God
[1:35:10] do you see anybody there do you see any
[1:35:12] more
[1:35:13] impersonation it's a different
[1:35:16] level
[1:35:17] Hallelujah so God never stop creating
[1:35:20] only one thing
[1:35:24] [Music]
[1:35:25] he created frog he created life and he
[1:35:29] created also flies now we are in a
[1:35:37] locust amen amen verse 12 and the Lord
[1:35:41] said to Moses stretch out your hand over
[1:35:43] the land of Egypt for the what the
[1:35:45] Locust that they may come up upon the
[1:35:48] land of Egypt and eat every herb of the
[1:35:52] land even all that uh all that the hell
[1:35:56] has left and Moses stretched forth his
[1:36:00] road over the land of Egypt remember
[1:36:03] he's using his road but we will see what
[1:36:05] really happened amen and the Lord
[1:36:09] brought a
[1:36:11] nwing upon the land of that day I mean
[1:36:15] all that day and all that night and when
[1:36:18] it was morning
[1:36:20] yes the East Wind brought what the
[1:36:27] Locust so the wind is blowing all night
[1:36:31] in the
[1:36:32] morning
[1:36:36] Locust let's see jum to verse 14 and the
[1:36:40] locus went over all the land of Egypt
[1:36:44] and rested in all the coast of Egypt
[1:36:48] very what Grievious were
[1:36:50] they before them there were no such
[1:36:56] Locust in other words those Locust never
[1:37:01] existed they were
[1:37:03] how and they were
[1:37:07] created are you I'm reading the Bible
[1:37:09] with you before them there were no such
[1:37:13] Locust as they neither after them shall
[1:37:18] be
[1:37:19] what so it's a Spees that only happened
[1:37:23] for a frame of
[1:37:27] time are we together are we together so
[1:37:32] these Locust were also created by
[1:37:36] God the FL created by God the L created
[1:37:41] by God the Frog created by God and
[1:37:44] according to what we see it m stretch uh
[1:37:48] Aaron Smite the dust that's what we
[1:37:51] hearing so in our man we look in at boom
[1:37:57] boom let's go to Psalm
[1:38:04] 105 then we begin to swar I was reading
[1:38:08] the Bible my
[1:38:09] friend amen let's go to Psalm
[1:38:16] 105 we are very good on time and you're
[1:38:20] doing very good on your reading of the
[1:38:22] scripture
[1:38:24] you there Psalm 105 verse 26 if you
[1:38:28] there you can say
[1:38:31] amen he sent
[1:38:33] whoes Moses's servant and who whom he
[1:38:37] has what chosen we back in Egypt you
[1:38:41] there he showed his son among them and
[1:38:46] wonders in the land of H that's another
[1:38:49] name for Egypt he sent Darkness who sent
[1:38:55] God and made it dark and they Rebel not
[1:38:59] against his word he turned their water
[1:39:02] into blood and slew their what fish it's
[1:39:06] God doing that when you go to Egypt who
[1:39:09] was doing that no when you look in Egypt
[1:39:12] who was doing all of
[1:39:14] that you look it's
[1:39:16] Moses amen but it's
[1:39:19] God Amen it's God in Moses
[1:39:24] are we together and then uh verse uh
[1:39:29] 29 and he turned the water into blood
[1:39:32] and slew their fish their land did what
[1:39:37] brought forth frog stop when we look and
[1:39:42] in uh Exodus the Bible say the river
[1:39:46] will do
[1:39:47] what bring forth but right here it says
[1:39:50] the what the land brought forth because
[1:39:55] everything come from the
[1:39:59] dust everything come from the dust of
[1:40:03] the Earth the water cannot produce a
[1:40:07] creature God created frog from the dust
[1:40:10] of the earth it was the land that
[1:40:12] produced it amen and then they came up
[1:40:16] upon the water and they moved them up so
[1:40:19] the land of Egypt was producing the dust
[1:40:22] of Egypt was producing the land was
[1:40:25] producing now we clear so far the this
[1:40:28] is David anded the anointing now he's
[1:40:31] picking up amen the PM are from David
[1:40:33] prophetic the Bible says their land not
[1:40:37] their River brought for frogs in
[1:40:40] abundance in the chambers of their King
[1:40:43] you there verse 31 he
[1:40:47] spoke who spoke God and there came a
[1:40:54] sort of whates so the Flies were not
[1:40:57] coming up by this somebody
[1:41:03] spoke now you begin to understand you
[1:41:05] need sometime to go to two places in the
[1:41:08] Bible and to get the scripture or the
[1:41:11] story correctly if you read the book of
[1:41:14] the king you need to go to first king
[1:41:17] and you need to go to the chronicle and
[1:41:19] you get the king and the chronicle
[1:41:21] together then you will get more light in
[1:41:24] the scripture if you stop in the
[1:41:26] chronicle you will miss something in the
[1:41:29] Kings if you go to the king you will
[1:41:31] miss something in the chronicle that's
[1:41:33] why they call the chronicle the third
[1:41:35] and the fourth book of the
[1:41:38] Kings amen amen when we read in uh in
[1:41:43] Exodus it was like Moses was stretching
[1:41:46] but now David say it was God speaking
[1:41:49] amen and God was speaking through Moses
[1:41:55] so these things were created by the
[1:41:57] spoken word now we begin to go somewhere
[1:42:01] the Bible says amen verse 31 he spoke
[1:42:05] not he
[1:42:06] struck not he struck something the Bible
[1:42:09] didn't say God struck and last came up
[1:42:12] David said God spoke but God was not
[1:42:16] there who was there who was speaking God
[1:42:20] he spoke and there came David source of
[1:42:22] what FES in and what so lights watch
[1:42:27] here and flies came by the spoken
[1:42:32] word whatever you read in the book of
[1:42:35] Exodus you need to upgrade your computer
[1:42:38] now what you have was elementary now
[1:42:41] your computer need to be upgraded that
[1:42:44] truly what happened Moses
[1:42:47] spoke Moses was speaking and the FL came
[1:42:51] they
[1:42:52] spoke he was not stretching like
[1:42:55] this life and death in the power of the
[1:43:00] tongue when they say you are God God in
[1:43:03] the beginning was the word and the Word
[1:43:08] was with who God and the Word was God so
[1:43:12] God created everything by the
[1:43:16] word if Moses is a god Moses must create
[1:43:20] things by the
[1:43:23] are we together are we together that's
[1:43:26] why squirel were created
[1:43:29] by now we begin to go slowly my friend
[1:43:33] amen amen oh
[1:43:37] God we on 31 drop to verse 34 my friend
[1:43:42] we almost finished with our scripture
[1:43:44] you there amen verse 34 he did
[1:43:47] what spoke again and the what the loc
[1:43:51] watch right here and the what
[1:43:55] loc when we go over there it was like
[1:43:59] the
[1:44:00] stretch here
[1:44:02] spoken when he spoke the Locust came and
[1:44:06] what caterpillars you see they added
[1:44:09] something that was not over
[1:44:11] there so it was not just look it's also
[1:44:14] the
[1:44:15] caterpillar upgrade your computer my
[1:44:18] friend amen and the cillar and that with
[1:44:23] number where did they get a Lo and
[1:44:25] caterpillar with number it was God
[1:44:28] creating that's why brother Bram says
[1:44:33] this remember Moses did what called into
[1:44:38] creation the message and the Bible are
[1:44:42] perfectly in line together when brother
[1:44:45] Bram say something God you with
[1:44:49] him you don't take the written word to
[1:44:53] challenge the word made
[1:44:55] flesh I don't know if you understanding
[1:44:58] me I don't know if you understanding me
[1:45:01] you don't take the written word to
[1:45:04] challenge the word made flesh let me say
[1:45:08] it plainly you don't take the Bible to
[1:45:12] challenge the
[1:45:16] message you need to go to the message
[1:45:19] and the message will bring you back to
[1:45:21] the Bible
[1:45:23] [Applause]
[1:45:27] that's the biggest error the Pharisee
[1:45:30] did that's why Jesus said go search your
[1:45:33] scripture brother Bram say Moses spoke
[1:45:37] in Exodus they say he stretch his head
[1:45:39] who do you believe today you found out
[1:45:42] that brother Bram was right because
[1:45:45] brother Bram is a
[1:45:47] Vindicated prophet of God for this
[1:45:51] age the
[1:45:53] the Bible
[1:45:58] one if you don't understand something BR
[1:46:01] Bram say cheat
[1:46:03] out if you don't understand something
[1:46:06] shut
[1:46:07] up give God some time to bring another
[1:46:12] minister to bring things together to
[1:46:15] clarify things so you can really get
[1:46:18] [Applause]
[1:46:19] it a superficial understanding
[1:46:23] have caused a mess in the
[1:46:26] [Applause]
[1:46:30] message who are you to challenge a
[1:46:33] Vindicated
[1:46:35] Prophet amen amen who wrote the book of
[1:46:41] of uh of
[1:46:42] Genesis who wrote exoduses who wrote
[1:46:46] Leviticus who wrote
[1:46:49] Deuteronomy who wrote all those books
[1:46:51] there those four that I read
[1:46:53] and Moses was a prophet how do you
[1:46:56] challenge Moses under which authority
[1:47:00] when Moses wrote was Moses with Adam how
[1:47:04] can Moses tell us what the conversation
[1:47:07] between Eve and the
[1:47:10] [Applause]
[1:47:17] serpent do you follow me we got Adam all
[1:47:21] the way to Enoch Enoch to Noah and Noah

[1:47:33] Isaac came Jacob from Jacob the
[1:47:36] patriarch and from there came Levi and L
[1:47:39] Moses under which authority Moses can
[1:47:43] you tell us what happened in the Garden
[1:47:45] of
[1:47:45] [Music]
[1:47:48] Eden why didn't Abraham give us that why
[1:47:53] didn't Abraham give us that but only
[1:47:56] Moses because God say with all the
[1:48:02] prophets I speak to them in vision and
[1:48:06] in dreams but with
[1:48:09] Moses I speak to
[1:48:15] [Applause]

[1:48:23] like unto
[1:48:24] Moses with two
[1:48:27] sons that God spoke to
[1:48:29] [Applause]
[1:48:30] [Music]
[1:48:34] [Applause]

[1:49:16] it that's why when the sword of the king
[1:49:19] hit his hand brother Bram say he fed his

[1:50:56] brother Bram say Moses did what called
[1:50:59] into creation that is
[1:51:01] what he pick up the Sun and throw up in
[1:51:04] the air and say let what fleas come and
[1:51:06] flee did what let what flies come and

[1:51:26] to begin
[1:51:27] with he was who Jehovah in what his
[1:51:35] Prophet am that's why brother I'm say
[1:51:38] the pillar of fire was in Moses I know
[1:51:42] this is hard to chew my friend how can
[1:51:44] Moses walk and his face begin to Even
[1:51:47] Shine
[1:51:53] are we together are we together are we
[1:51:56] together there's only one person that
[1:51:59] can create it's only God if you try to
[1:52:02] put it on the devil you make the devil
[1:52:05] coequal that's what brother brandham say
[1:52:08] let's look at the word
[1:52:11] coequal glory to God everybody okay if
[1:52:16] you fool you tell me I push the break
[1:52:18] because this maneral they have to sink
[1:52:20] slowly brother Bram say in the message
[1:52:23] show us the father you believe God is
[1:52:27] well here you believe God is well in his
[1:52:31] creation God is where in his word God is
[1:52:35] where in his son now God where in his
[1:52:39] [Applause]
[1:52:43] people are we together everything that
[1:52:47] God was was put where into Jesus Christ
[1:52:50] he was what called equal with the father
[1:52:54] is that
[1:52:57] [Applause]
[1:53:02] right everything that was in God was put
[1:53:04] in who Jesus and Jesus Christ was
[1:53:09] what with
[1:53:14] God glory to God brother Bram say is
[1:53:18] that right thinking not he give you
[1:53:21] scripture thinking not what robbery but
[1:53:25] he was what equal with the father in
[1:53:27] other words when Jesus say I am God
[1:53:30] Jesus doesn't think like ah I'm taking
[1:53:34] I'm taking too much upon myself he
[1:53:37] thought not robber he was not stealing
[1:53:41] something away from God he was that God
[1:53:44] that's why he say I am God so so the
[1:53:48] thinking of Jesus was not like God is
[1:53:50] different than him
[1:53:53] [Music]
[1:53:56] Hallelujah but when he speak to the
[1:53:59] people he said my father is greater than
[1:54:04] me and the people say come on where is
[1:54:07] that father and then he turned around he
[1:54:09] say ah you never understand all this
[1:54:13] time that when you see you see who
[1:54:17] father
[1:54:22] are we together are we together are we

[2:03:29] who Jesus Christ this is the what the
[2:03:33] true
[2:03:36] God verify your Bible my friend so who
[2:03:40] is the true
[2:03:44] God now you can tell Satan in the name
[2:03:48] of Jesus
[2:03:53] because your Revelation is
[2:03:56] [Applause]
[2:03:59] different listen to me
[2:04:01] carefully listen to me carefully listen
[2:04:05] to me carefully if I have a
[2:04:08] servant and my servant I'm just picking
[2:04:11] up my friend is brother Angelo and I say
[2:04:13] brother Angelo go tell the the man over
[2:04:16] there to leave my
[2:04:18] property amen or go tell him go get my
[2:04:21] stuff over there brother Angelo goes as
[2:04:24] a
[2:04:26] servant amen he's hired he's going to go
[2:04:29] he say brother Steven
[2:04:32] say Amen give this thing it belongs to
[2:04:36] him amen amen if the servant give get
[2:04:41] some difficulty he can stop and say you
[2:04:43] know what I need to go back to the BS
[2:04:45] and go tell the boss but if I call my
[2:04:50] son and I tell my son you see what is
[2:04:53] there it is for us it belongs to
[2:04:58] us the son will understand that hey this
[2:05:01] is my
[2:05:02] property I said go get that thing belong
[2:05:05] to us my son won't behave like brother
[2:05:08] Angelo even though brother Angelo is my
[2:05:10] son I'm just picking up an example my
[2:05:12] son won't belong like he won't behave
[2:05:14] like brother Angelo my son will go with
[2:05:16] a different understanding what belongs
[2:05:19] to Daddy belongs to me so when my son
[2:05:24] speak his face is
[2:05:27] [Applause]
[2:05:31] different one speak with a revelation
[2:05:35] one thing speak as a super fish servant
[2:05:40] and that's the problem with the devil
[2:05:43] you can say Satan in the name of Jesus
[2:05:46] Christ and the way you saying that you
[2:05:49] are saying in the name of Jesus Christ
[2:05:51] that Jesus Christ is a God and I'm
[2:05:54] getting authority to throw
[2:05:57] you you need to change that when you
[2:06:01] telling the devil you say in the name of
[2:06:05] Jesus understanding that me and Jesus we
[2:06:09] are one so whatever belong to Jesus
[2:06:13] belong to me
[2:06:16] [Applause]
[2:06:22] I don't know if you getting me I don't
[2:06:24] know if you catching me brother Angelo
[2:06:27] can stop and back up my son won't back
[2:06:30] up if the man say no my son will change
[2:06:34] his behavior he will say give it it's
[2:06:36] for my father give it give it it's for
[2:06:39] my daddy he can fight for it because of
[2:06:42] the level of
[2:06:47] revelation so what belongs to me when I
[2:06:51] put
[2:06:52] when I engage in a fight I don't let it
[2:06:56] go until Satan give me because it
[2:07:00] belongs to me and my
[2:07:07] father can I add something can I add
[2:07:11] something if my son knows that I'm doing
[2:07:16] that so he can show me that he's really
[2:07:19] courageous
[2:07:22] it get even more deadly because he want
[2:07:25] to prove his
[2:07:26] father if I don't bring this daddy will
[2:07:29] think I'm a coward so I need to do
[2:07:31] everything I can until I come back with
[2:07:34] fa and when he come back I say good boy
[2:07:36] that's how a man should
[2:07:43] beave so when you engage in the B don't
[2:07:46] go back make your father proud of
[2:07:50] you thank you let God testify to the
[2:07:53] devil and say do you see Shadrach do you
[2:07:57] see M do you see job what did I tell you
[2:07:59] look at him what did I tell you that boy
[2:08:02] knows how to fight my friend do you
[2:08:05] [Applause]
[2:08:09] see because when I sent you to him I
[2:08:12] knew who he was I knew he's not going to
[2:08:16] disappoint
[2:08:19] me are we together are we together Lord
[2:08:24] help me oh God he says and we are in him
[2:08:27] that is what true even the in his son
[2:08:31] Jesus Christ this is the what true God
[2:08:33] and what eternal life now we don't know
[2:08:36] just the Lord now we begin to understand
[2:08:39] that that Lord is Jesus Christ so the
[2:08:42] true God is Jesus Christ that's why we
[2:08:44] worship Jesus Christ as the only true
[2:08:48] God the Jehovah of the Old Testament is
[2:08:51] Jesus in the New
[2:08:55] Testament are we clear with that
[2:08:57] Revelation are we okay are you
[2:09:01] full that was Jesus Christ everybody say

[2:09:21] last week on Sunday we saw that the
[2:09:24] Bible Paul say that Thou loveth
[2:09:26] righteous and hateth what
[2:09:29] iniquity and hateth iniquity
[2:09:33] therefore therefore God even thy God you
[2:09:39] remember it's like God talking to God
[2:09:43] therefore God even th we found out that
[2:09:47] those two gods are
