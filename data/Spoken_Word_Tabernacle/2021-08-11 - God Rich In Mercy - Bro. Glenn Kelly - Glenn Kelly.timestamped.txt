[21:30] i decided to say let me just check my
[21:32] pressure check my pressure was like 177
[21:35] over 114
[21:37] and
[21:38] i just want to give god thanks that i'm
[21:40] here to give this testimony today and i
[21:43] just ask you to keep on praying for us
[21:45] thank you
[21:46] [Applause]
[21:51] amen
[21:59] i just got a small
[22:01] testimony thank the lord but um i was
[22:03] talking to an elderly sister i've known
[22:05] in um
[22:07] maryland today and just checking on him
[22:09] hadn't talked to him a couple years and
[22:12] so she said how's brother sam and sister
[22:14] teresa going
[22:15] and i said they're fine and then i
[22:17] looked in the parking lot and there he
[22:19] is
[22:21] [Applause]
[22:27] i want to thank the lord for all of his
[22:29] goodness he has brought me through
[22:32] so many things
[22:34] and he is just continually blessing us
[22:37] so i just really want to thank the lord
[22:38] for that
[22:39] [Applause]
[22:44] we'll pass it around we've got time for
[22:45] testimonies right
[22:47] i just want to thank the lord tonight
[22:51] for a specific breakthrough
[22:53] for a long time
[22:56] i had a barrier of not being able to
[22:59] read the message listen to the message
[23:02] and pray almost almost two years
[23:05] and
[23:06] by his grace and by his sovereign mercy
[23:10] that's been broken i am reading the
[23:12] message listening to the message and
[23:14] wanting to that's the part that that's
[23:17] the part that i'm excited about and just
[23:19] the last part i'm believing that will
[23:20] happen really soon is just getting on my
[23:22] knees and praying and giving him the
[23:24] preeminence in my life continuously so i
[23:26] just want to thank the lord for that
[23:30] [Applause]
[23:37] so it's a testimony and a prayer request
[23:42] i would say maybe about a month a month
[23:44] and a half ago my husband was offered
[23:47] a promotion innocence and it was to send
[23:50] him to kentucky to do work
[23:52] and as a wife we're like okay you know
[23:54] stepped out on faith god took me out of
[23:56] the work field so we're down to one
[23:58] income that sounds great
[24:01] then lo and behold the lord puts on our
[24:02] pastor's heart to give that sermon
[24:05] nothing comes before christ
[24:08] so we trusted in god again
[24:11] and
[24:12] the position presented itself and it was
[24:14] like okay well we'll send you to
[24:16] kentucky for just a week and he said no
[24:18] babe i'm gonna ask that we have you know
[24:20] i can get off work at a certain time on
[24:22] wednesdays to make it to church because
[24:24] that was a burden on his heart and the
[24:26] lord answered that prayer
[24:28] he's here um and we're just asking that
[24:30] y'all continue to pray with us that
[24:32] kentucky goes well for that week he
[24:34] comes back home no issues and he can
[24:36] continue to get wednesdays off for
[24:37] church
[24:42] [Applause]
[24:46] amen we also had a prayer request as
[24:49] well brother hamilton handed this to me
[24:52] before service but grandfather's health
[24:54] is declining wanted to pray for his
[24:56] healing also to keep the family in
[24:59] prayer they they're traveling out to see
[25:00] him they're leaving friday and returning

[25:05] we'll keep we'll keep them in prayer
[25:08] and may god give them traveling mercies
[25:10] on the road and bring them back home
[25:11] safely
[25:12] does anybody have an unspoken request on
[25:14] their heart this evening
[25:16] amen
[25:18] and we'll get brother sam to come pray
[25:20] for us this evening
[25:28] our heavenly father we're so grateful
[25:29] lord jesus that you're an ever-present
[25:31] hope in a time of trouble lord
[25:34] you promised lord jesus that you'd heal
[25:36] all our diseases
[25:37] lord you said our sin our iniquity you
[25:40] would remember remember no more
[25:42] but father we don't want to take your
[25:44] grace of god
[25:45] in vain lord jesus we want to appreciate
[25:48] it lord we want to love you for it lord
[25:51] and lord it's a small thing to me for
[25:53] perfect love to want to be loved
[25:55] perfectly and so lord jesus if we have a
[25:58] request before you this evening lord we
[26:01] all want to love you perfectly with all
[26:03] our heart with all our mind and with all
[26:06] our soul
[26:07] and lord for the needs that was was
[26:09] spoken father lord before the need was
[26:12] was there there was already a remedy
[26:14] lord jesus and father we're so grateful
[26:16] lord that you made that remedy before
[26:19] satan could ever make a problem you
[26:21] already had the cross prepared lord you
[26:23] slew the lamb before the foundation of
[26:25] the world lord jesus
[26:27] satan never gets a step up on you lord
[26:30] and that's one thing as a child of god
[26:32] that i've come to realize lord that
[26:34] everything is working together for my
[26:36] good and lord jesus all the stress all
[26:39] the worry if it's happening it's
[26:41] happening for my good and lord jesus
[26:44] there's a lot of things that we don't
[26:45] ask for but they come our way but we're
[26:48] not going to murmur we're not going to
[26:49] complain because lord jesus the children
[26:52] of israel was given for an example unto
[26:54] us and now we can read back in the book
[26:57] of exodus and numbers and we can see
[26:59] where they made their pitfalls lord and
[27:01] lord jesus we're able to avoid them with
[27:03] your guidance and i'm so grateful that
[27:06] you're you're a caring father that
[27:08] whatever we ask for lord jesus you'll
[27:10] give it to us and so if we have a lack
[27:13] of a prayer life if we just told you
[27:15] lord we're lacking in our prayer life
[27:17] lord you'll help us to increase our
[27:18] prayer life if we're lacking attending
[27:21] our our bible readings lord and we come
[27:23] to you and say lord i don't think i'm
[27:24] paying enough attention to my bible
[27:26] please increase my hunger lord you'll do
[27:29] that for us you love us jesus you didn't
[27:32] come to condemn the world but you came
[27:34] that the world might have life and have
[27:36] it more abundantly and now we're sitting
[27:38] at your table tonight lord jesus with
[27:41] only one purpose in mind and that's lord
[27:44] god that we can hear your word that our
[27:46] faith can be in strengthened lord god

[36:25] i was standing there and i can feel the
[36:27] anointing i begin even to sweat
[36:29] [Laughter]
[36:31] amen because god have predestinated us
[36:35] to be vessels of
[36:38] mercy amen
[36:40] amen
[36:41] no matter what is going on remember you
[36:44] are a vessel of
[36:46] mercy regardless where are you going to
[36:49] be god will drop down
[36:51] pass everything break every law all the
[36:54] way even in hell he would drop there and
[36:56] pick you up because you have
[36:58] predestinated to be saved he put a love
[37:02] of the truth in you
[37:04] you can't help it sister zadie it's

[37:15] jehovah elohim
[37:18] hallelujah do you know what elohim means
[37:20] the one that existed by
[37:23] by himself he didn't want to stay like
[37:25] that
[37:26] remember on sunday
[37:28] he failed all time all space and
[37:30] eternity and he had to shrink himself
[37:34] because he wanted to express himself
[37:37] hallelujah
[37:38] before i came to church the lord
[37:40] reminded me that i forgot
[37:42] omniscient
[37:44] and omnipresent
[37:46] so lord's willing on sunday we will see
[37:49] when god shrank
[37:51] how deep god became omniscient
[37:54] how does he know everything
[37:56] and how does
[37:57] god become omnipresent
[38:01] it's not the way we thought before amen
[38:04] there is a key to that that being the
[38:07] fear of time space and eternity when he
[38:10] shrank
[38:11] he opened up certain attributes it is so
[38:14] beautiful
[38:15] amen

[43:24] came in here but we trust in that all is
[43:28] well
[43:28] we don't plan to keep you uh
[43:31] long um on tonight by the grace of god
[43:33] but
[43:34] we want him to have his way
[43:38] psalms 119 and verse 41 he says let thy
[43:42] mercies come
[43:43] also unto me
[43:45] o lord even thy salvation according to
[43:48] thy word
[43:49] and let's go to um ephesians and then
[43:52] you could be seated after this
[43:54] chapter 2
[43:57] and
[43:58] let's look at the
[44:03] verse 4 5 and 6. once you have it say
[44:05] amen
[44:07] he says but god who is rich in mercy
[44:10] for his great love wherewith he loves us
[44:13] even when we were dead in sins have
[44:16] quickened us together with christ by
[44:18] grace you are saved
[44:20] and have raised us up together and made
[44:23] us sit together in heavenly places in
[44:25] christ jesus may the lord add a blessing
[44:27] to the reading of his word you may be
[44:29] seated
[44:30] and just a little simple thought you're
[44:32] familiar with god's rich in
[44:34] mercy god's rich in mercy i tell you i
[44:37] just couldn't get away from it i was
[44:39] pressing and laboring it's been it's
[44:41] been a fight but uh we thank the lord
[44:43] for your prayers tonight and in your
[44:45] pools
[44:46] so you know how it is by the grace of
[44:48] god when you're looking but it couldn't
[44:51] get away from mercy
[44:53] you know when you look at what the lord
[44:55] has brought us
[44:56] sunday morning i tell you it was just
[44:58] richly a blessing
[45:00] you know we got some a lot of reading
[45:03] here but we got our timer up here also
[45:05] we understand this wednesday night
[45:07] so uh we just want to lay a foundation
[45:10] and um we want to we're going to kind of
[45:12] really want to work out of um luke 15
[45:14] but we're going to lay a foundation here
[45:16] on tonight maybe some of you can see and
[45:19] can help you
[45:20] while you're not getting the mercies of
[45:23] god that you should be getting from god
[45:26] you know we know it's ours
[45:28] we know we've been predestinated
[45:31] we know that it can't be taken away from
[45:34] us because god had us we're at in the
[45:37] back of his mind before the foundation
[45:39] of the world is that right
[45:41] so if god had us in the back of his mind
[45:43] before the foundation of the world we
[45:45] were all attributes
[45:47] and you were attributes you were in the
[45:49] mind of god that's the reason why you
[45:51] don't know a whole lot about god right
[45:53] now really let us get there you'll see
[45:55] because you were just a thought at the
[45:58] time i'll take my time god help me
[46:03] he says now
[46:04] look he says now moses he says and now
[46:07] then we find out that we have come to
[46:09] another ephesus
[46:12] it says now the episodes where that
[46:15] we are in our intellectual not an
[46:18] intellectual denomination and forth our
[46:21] education programs has come in
[46:23] it says then we must
[46:26] and ephesians again we must have in
[46:30] ephesians again
[46:31] ephesians is parallel to joshua is that
[46:34] right within jehovah's savior
[46:37] so we know that it has to be a coming
[46:40] out and going in is that right so it has
[46:43] to be that coming out as they came out
[46:45] of egypt and it was going in is that
[46:47] right into the land and to the promised
[46:50] land but of course we know that that
[46:52] wasn't a stop because abraham was what
[46:55] the seed of abraham was looking for a
[46:57] city and a builder in the maker that was
[46:59] of god is that right
[47:01] so we know that god is moving in his
[47:04] hour here now
[47:05] because his mercy and his grace you know
[47:08] you can preach on this until he come
[47:11] i mean because there's so many angles on
[47:13] this but we want to bring it up to how a
[47:16] prophet of god was working with it and
[47:19] how we have to realize in this hour here
[47:21] now that's why you get the word and
[47:24] that's why you get the prophet the words
[47:26] of the prophet which the word that the
[47:28] prophet comes out of the scriptures
[47:30] because he said in this area in his time
[47:32] now if those two spirits is going to be
[47:35] so close it's going to deceive the very
[47:38] elect if it was possible is that right
[47:41] so it's just like the holy spirit is
[47:43] telling what's ministering to us about
[47:45] the second death you're going to have
[47:47] people that can meant to talk about the
[47:50] second death right here in this message
[47:52] and they could talk about the second
[47:53] death but god has shared us is her
[47:56] natural in that natural death is still
[47:59] two deaths is that right it's the deaths
[48:01] of the flesh which of the body and
[48:04] there's the death of the spirit which of
[48:06] the spirit and the soul is that right he
[48:08] says to them but when you die of that
[48:11] flesh we know that it's corruption that
[48:14] sets in in that flesh is that right but
[48:16] down in your soul is two depths there
[48:20] you can doubt one
[48:22] you'll go further from god when you die
[48:24] in the spirit is that right
[48:26] and your soul can be totally annihilated
[48:29] if you're not from god
[48:31] and then there's the other part it goes
[48:34] because it tells we die what we died
[48:37] daily is that right so we want to go
[48:39] come further from god and one has drawn
[48:41] us closer to god so we have to
[48:44] understand now you're moving into the
[48:47] mind of god that's what the holy spirit
[48:51] is moving us into we're getting ready to
[48:54] get out of here
[48:55] it's not much longer saints and we're
[48:58] going to read some things that help you
[49:00] along by the grace of god we know that
[49:03] god is rich in mercy ever since the
[49:05] foundation of the world is that right
[49:08] before the foundation of the world
[49:10] because now which he showed us that he
[49:13] was a what a big circle is that right
[49:16] and then that big circle was there and
[49:18] it was just void it was just god those
[49:21] seven rainbow colors is that right
[49:23] so that's the way god is god is is
[49:27] eternal we know that he was elohim
[49:30] he was self-existing all by himself is
[49:34] that right and then just bear with me
[49:36] because we're laying a foundation but
[49:38] then when that in the garden when then
[49:41] he formed men from the garden is that
[49:44] right when he formed man from that guard
[49:46] let me back up a little bit because the
[49:48] holy spirit hid it brother stevie that
[49:50] was a confirmation when you said mercy i
[49:53] didn't know which way he was going you
[49:55] know his time they got around in it
[49:57] sometimes brother freddie you just gotta
[49:59] move by faith god don't deal with you
[50:01] the same way all the time he just wants
[50:03] you to move and trust him is that right
[50:06] trust in the lord in all thy ways and
[50:08] lean not to that own understanding is
[50:11] that right so we know it's by the grace
[50:13] and the mercies of god
[50:15] and so we know when god shrunk down is
[50:18] that right he came down to that what
[50:21] logos is that right and when he said
[50:24] that local said he spoke he said let
[50:26] there be what light and there was light
[50:29] is that right so god you have to
[50:31] understand we are moving into a
[50:34] supernatural god
[50:36] you are moving into your position that
[50:39] god have called you for before the
[50:42] foundation of the world
[50:44] we are having a revival over the word
[50:47] because it's an opening of the word and
[50:50] the bride is a word bride she loves the
[50:53] word she can't wait to come into the
[50:56] presence of the lord is that right help
[50:58] us tonight lord we need your help
[51:01] hallelujah
[51:04] so he says look
[51:05] he says i want to take
[51:07] from
[51:08] here and this is our topic the god
[51:11] that's rich in mercy
[51:13] he says i want to you to notice here
[51:16] the apostle paul he made mention of this
[51:19] he
[51:20] he quickened who were once dead now this
[51:24] is god rich in mercy if you're taking
[51:25] your notes like i said i don't have
[51:27] powerpoint so you're taking your notes
[51:29] it's 1
[51:30] 1965 in the sixth chapter
[51:33] he says
[51:35] he says we were what dead ins in sin and
[51:38] trespasses walking after the things of
[51:41] the world the desire of the flesh and
[51:43] fulfilling the desire of the mind in the
[51:46] spirit so see you have to understand
[51:49] we're going to get ready to move into
[51:51] something it's not just brother steve
[51:54] he's a lot of times he makes statements
[51:57] but if you study the message and digging
[51:59] the message
[52:00] it's quotes that's coming from the
[52:02] prophet that ties right in with the
[52:04] scriptures so we're moving into a
[52:07] supernatural act now is that right
[52:09] nothing is going to be able to stand and
[52:12] stand in front of you we are seen to be
[52:14] victorious to live a victorious life god
[52:18] is granting us is that right
[52:20] um brother abel you got a testimony is
[52:23] that right well that thought that wasn't
[52:25] yours but it was yours why because you
[52:27] had a desire in your heart but it's for
[52:30] the glory of god is that right
[52:33] everything we do we have to do it for
[52:35] the glory of god so you children you
[52:39] have to understand that's where they get
[52:41] themselves in trouble right get take it
[52:44] on the cardinal mind
[52:46] fellowshipping with devils and demons
[52:49] out there in this world today okay so
[52:51] we're moving into something so now you
[52:54] have to realize these religious demons
[52:57] they're going to be able to take this
[52:59] bible the same bible that we got is that
[53:01] right but they're not going to have what
[53:04] the revelation because the anointing
[53:06] comes from god
[53:08] god back it the anointing is what breaks
[53:11] the yokes upon the people you have to
[53:14] come in
[53:15] expectation
[53:16] god is richly blessing you look how many
[53:19] children that god has brought to you
[53:22] come to hear from your father tonight
[53:24] he's pleased with that and what you come
[53:27] expecting he's going to grant it to you
[53:29] is that right it's time to get right
[53:32] with god it's time to get in your
[53:34] position we're going to read some things
[53:36] to show you why you're not getting the
[53:39] full mercy of god you can't fool god i
[53:43] can't fool god none of us can't fool god
[53:46] is that right
[53:47] hallelujah
[53:49] help us lord thank you jesus
[53:51] he said now look
[53:52] he said what caused this change
[53:55] and what caused it
[53:57] from one time being dead
[53:59] too quick and quick it means you made a
[54:02] lie
[54:03] that's right brother you are made alive
[54:06] god the only one can do that
[54:09] he says now look
[54:10] there was a change from death unto life
[54:13] there is no other thing
[54:15] that can happen to any person listen to
[54:19] this
[54:20] and don't let it go over your head
[54:23] he says
[54:25] it says now this there
[54:27] there is no other thing that could
[54:30] happen to any person so great as to
[54:33] change him from death
[54:36] to life
[54:39] huh
[54:40] look at that mercies of god that he has
[54:43] put in the hands and the lips of his
[54:46] children is that right
[54:48] for god so loved the world he gave his
[54:51] only what begotten son is that right at
[54:54] the cross at the cross where we first
[54:57] saw the light and the burdens of our
[54:59] heart rode away but it was there by what
[55:02] faith that i received my sight see the
[55:05] atonement it was a big jesus came so
[55:08] they may have life everyone could have
[55:10] life and have life more abundantly but
[55:12] the atonement was really only for the
[55:15] elect
[55:18] that's all it was really for because the
[55:20] plan of redemption is to buy back
[55:23] somebody that was already there is that
[55:25] right so that's why the holy spirit told
[55:28] us sunday morning you could only be born
[55:31] again to be born again you was already
[55:36] with him before the foundation of the
[55:38] world he's bringing us back to where we
[55:41] once was
[55:43] [Applause]
[55:45] look what he says
[55:47] it's your mercy
[55:49] he says now
[55:51] he says a man
[55:52] if he was dying physically and could be
[55:55] healed physically that would be a great
[55:57] thing
[55:59] but nothing so great as when he is
[56:01] spiritually dead
[56:03] and god has quickened him to life
[56:07] god's only one can do that
[56:10] because he knows that's why
[56:13] the last time when we was here we was
[56:15] telling you about those attributes of
[56:17] that body
[56:19] that seed with the holy spirit when the
[56:21] pastor was ministering about that seed
[56:24] in that tree you remember when we got in
[56:26] that seed in that tree
[56:29] where before that tree could be a big
[56:31] tree it had to be a what a seed there is
[56:34] that right
[56:36] a fertile seed a seed that have to have
[56:40] life in it is that right and the only
[56:42] seed that had life in it is a faith seed
[56:46] that faith seed that god put there god
[56:49] put it there but guys see the devil
[56:52] thought he had us in our july in our
[56:54] life drinking
[56:56] smoking drugging
[56:59] stealing
[57:00] lying
[57:02] okay robbing
[57:04] but god
[57:06] rich in mercy
[57:08] put a faith seed there before the
[57:11] foundation of the world
[57:14] he hid us
[57:16] he was not only hit us in his mind when
[57:19] he hit us in his mind he hid the fake
[57:22] seat down there before the foundation of
[57:25] the world
[57:27] look what he says
[57:29] he says now
[57:31] he says
[57:32] and dead and god has quickened him to
[57:35] life
[57:36] you know you once in the past time you
[57:38] were dead even men here tonight we can
[57:41] look back
[57:42] but when we were dead
[57:45] listen what the prophet said
[57:47] you deserved
[57:49] that way because
[57:50] you was a sinner
[57:53] he says
[57:55] that help me lord he said but god
[57:58] who is rich in mercy
[58:01] that's the thing
[58:02] god who was rich all these things that
[58:06] we were but god
[58:08] made the change right there
[58:11] god who is rich in mercy
[58:14] that's why paul told them
[58:16] over there in romans
[58:18] 12 he said i beseech brother
[58:22] by what by the mercies of god
[58:26] now he was telling them never forget
[58:30] the mercies of god
[58:33] because they were blind
[58:35] then the holy spirit had to pass the
[58:37] menace to us months ago and showed us
[58:40] you know you were raised up you know the
[58:43] jews where they were chosen people you
[58:46] had that time to live by the law but to
[58:48] show no man could keep the law
[58:51] but they were still heathens just like
[58:54] the gentiles
[58:56] so paul was trying to show them it
[58:59] wasn't the law that was going to save
[59:01] you you ought to remember the mercies of
[59:05] god because jesus came
[59:08] in the redeemer
[59:10] and fulfilled the law is that right
[59:13] the law was just a school master
[59:16] there's always difference to keep us but
[59:18] he came to fulfill the law
[59:21] i mean fulfilled the law by what mercy
[59:25] and grace is that right
[59:27] so paul constantly reminded them
[59:30] what he did for him he justified them
[59:34] he's sanctified
[59:37] he's filling with the holy ghost
[59:41] but look he talked paul talked about the
[59:43] adoption but he brought a win in our
[59:46] time is that right
[59:48] we won't get ahead of ourselves we get
[59:50] over there to luke 15. that's what i
[59:52] basically want to work with we're just
[59:53] laying the foundation
[59:55] he said now look
[59:57] he says i'm so glad for that
[1:00:00] he said that he being rich in mercy
[1:00:03] see we thank god for the finances we
[1:00:06] thank god for our homes we thank god for
[1:00:09] our transportation we thank god for
[1:00:11] these things we thank god for our
[1:00:14] education but imagine if that's all he
[1:00:16] was reaching
[1:00:18] huh
[1:00:19] but god
[1:00:20] is rich in mercy
[1:00:23] is that right
[1:00:24] abel made a way
[1:00:26] he became the atonement
[1:00:29] shed his blood for you and i
[1:00:32] you are more valuable you are the value
[1:00:35] of the blood the valuable of the blood
[1:00:39] god thought so much of you he came down
[1:00:43] is that right he came down
[1:00:46] that's why it is that we're here now all
[1:00:48] the fussing it's the sign of the time
[1:00:52] if people are fussing about this and
[1:00:54] fussing about that the prophet of god
[1:00:56] already told us that's the sign of the
[1:00:59] time is that right
[1:01:01] so we're going to show you god spoke
[1:01:03] more of his second coming than
[1:01:06] any other thing is that right because he
[1:01:08] knows that he living he loved me dying
[1:01:12] he saved me buried he carried my sins
[1:01:15] far away
[1:01:16] and rising the assurance that it's a
[1:01:19] life after this life
[1:01:22] the pastor just wasn't talking when
[1:01:24] you're talking about you can be there
[1:01:26] now in your mind and you could be over a
[1:01:28] place over there you see something and
[1:01:30] then you could be back there and then
[1:01:32] you could be over there i'm telling you
[1:01:34] saints when god unfold the word now is
[1:01:38] the time to move in it
[1:01:41] you can move in it
[1:01:43] god say prove me
[1:01:45] is that right
[1:01:46] god rich in mercy see this lay of the
[1:01:49] seer generation i don't know why you
[1:01:51] want to be part of the lao to see a
[1:01:53] generation out there they're blind
[1:01:57] miserable
[1:01:58] wretched
[1:02:00] naked
[1:02:01] say and say they rich of goods and don't
[1:02:04] what and don't need god
[1:02:07] look at that spirit of this age
[1:02:10] but god
[1:02:11] rich in mercy he's keeping us from it is
[1:02:15] that right he's watching over us
[1:02:18] he's the prosperous he's whatever we do
[1:02:21] and word indeed do it in the name of the
[1:02:23] lord acknowledge the lord in everything
[1:02:26] you do he will lead he will guide he
[1:02:29] will direct your path
[1:02:32] so now we can say what
[1:02:34] that's why the last time i was here by
[1:02:37] the grace of god pastor i was there was
[1:02:40] just just a different anointing because
[1:02:42] now i know why there is a revelation oh
[1:02:45] death ah
[1:02:47] where's thy thing ah
[1:02:50] grave ah
[1:02:51] where's thy victory glory be to god i'm
[1:02:55] not leaving here until god says time for
[1:02:58] me to leave here i'm not going anywhere
[1:03:01] until my work is finished here that took
[1:03:03] me to another level thank you jesus
[1:03:08] you can go boldly to the throne of god
[1:03:11] with mercy and grace
[1:03:14] look what he says
[1:03:16] the boldness
[1:03:17] he says i'm
[1:03:19] so glad
[1:03:20] for that being the rich he said he's
[1:03:23] just rich in materials which he is but
[1:03:25] yet
[1:03:26] greatest thing is being rich in mercy
[1:03:30] or what a great word that is
[1:03:33] how that we were once dead
[1:03:36] and we were speaking other we knew let
[1:03:39] me drop down had to jump a little bit
[1:03:41] because i'm keeping up with my time
[1:03:43] he said now look
[1:03:45] he says we might i might inject
[1:03:48] just to tell them a little doctrine here
[1:03:50] if you don't believe it all right that's
[1:03:52] okay
[1:03:53] i i believe it he says when he is born
[1:03:57] in this world
[1:03:58] he says when that little baby born in
[1:04:01] the world you could not have been
[1:04:05] here without being what
[1:04:07] for knowledge of god being predestinated
[1:04:12] these things see god is shortening the
[1:04:15] days for who the elect fake is that
[1:04:18] right who can bring any charge against
[1:04:22] god's elect
[1:04:24] no one for his god that justified you
[1:04:27] for his god that sanctified you for his
[1:04:30] god that filled you with the holy ghost
[1:04:32] for you are his workmanship he is the
[1:04:35] pride we are the pride we he's the
[1:04:37] potter and we are the clay is that right
[1:04:39] it's god molding and shaping us into the
[1:04:42] image just like he is
[1:04:44] hallelujah
[1:04:47] thank you
[1:04:48] getting a little warm in here
[1:04:50] hallelujah
[1:04:52] he said now look
[1:04:55] he says
[1:04:56] he says now
[1:04:58] let me jump a little bit
[1:05:00] help me lord
[1:05:01] he says says we always and the reason we
[1:05:05] were because we
[1:05:07] are a part of god
[1:05:09] you is always eternal
[1:05:12] you got to start thinking
[1:05:15] like god
[1:05:18] [Music]
[1:05:21] then you can move into your position he
[1:05:24] will show you you understand it's a
[1:05:26] wisdom with everything this is the age
[1:05:29] this is the time
[1:05:32] let me keep going he said now look
[1:05:35] he said now we are a part of god
[1:05:38] you always was
[1:05:41] you don't remember it because you were
[1:05:43] only attributes he was saying that
[1:05:45] earlier
[1:05:46] he says you were only in his thinking
[1:05:50] your very name it was on the book of
[1:05:53] life boy ain't that beautiful
[1:05:56] huh
[1:05:57] all names that was not on the lamb's
[1:06:00] book of life will worship the beast
[1:06:02] is that right but our name was written
[1:06:06] on the lambs of light by his blood by
[1:06:09] the blood of god
[1:06:11] god came down and redeemed us back
[1:06:14] himself
[1:06:16] somebody failed to send me a text about
[1:06:18] who is jesus i said jesus wasn't black
[1:06:22] jesus wasn't white
[1:06:24] jesus wasn't jew
[1:06:26] and jesus wasn't gentile
[1:06:28] jesus was god
[1:06:30] men are fleshed it in the flesh
[1:06:33] he was the son of god and he was god he
[1:06:36] said who do men say that i am he says
[1:06:39] there are some say you're elijah some
[1:06:42] say you jeremiah some say you john the
[1:06:45] baptist
[1:06:46] some say you william branham but who do
[1:06:49] the elect of spoken word say that he is
[1:06:53] thou art the christ the son of the
[1:06:55] living god upon this rock flesh and
[1:06:58] blood have not revealed this unto you
[1:07:01] only my father which is in heaven could
[1:07:04] reveal this to you but upon this rock
[1:07:07] i'll build my church and the gates of
[1:07:10] hell shall not prevail against it get
[1:07:12] back satan get your hands off of god's
[1:07:15] kingdom
[1:07:19] see when you came out
[1:07:21] when you came out of egypt see they were
[1:07:24] the people of god
[1:07:25] then when they came out right while they
[1:07:28] were in egypt they were the people of
[1:07:31] god
[1:07:31] when they came out
[1:07:33] they were the church of god
[1:07:35] that was old testament speaking ah
[1:07:39] women in the new testament he said when
[1:07:42] we got in there he where we were what we
[1:07:45] were the eaglettes we were the child of
[1:07:49] the kingdom we the messiahs when we came
[1:07:53] in there so now what did he talk we part
[1:07:56] of the kingdom of god is that right
[1:08:00] we're no longer we are sons and
[1:08:02] daughters of the most high god is that
[1:08:05] right
[1:08:06] listen where we going help me lord
[1:08:09] it's time to start thinking like god
[1:08:12] see
[1:08:13] god rich in mercy
[1:08:15] it was rich in mercy see the prophet of
[1:08:17] god was just about to leave the scene
[1:08:20] but god opened this up to him he opened
[1:08:22] it up to him look how rich of mercy it
[1:08:24] was this 1965
[1:08:28] hallelujah some of you wasn't even born
[1:08:31] but look how much he loves you
[1:08:33] god is rich in mercy he saved it for his
[1:08:37] bride he waited until this time
[1:08:40] he brought you in this age
[1:08:42] because you are overcomers is that right
[1:08:45] you are achieve us and
[1:08:47] let your motive and objective be god's
[1:08:50] will and whatever you ask you can
[1:08:53] receive but let it be according to god's
[1:08:57] will and you will be successful in it
[1:09:04] we're not gonna have no time to fool
[1:09:06] with satan you ain't the time to fuss
[1:09:07] with no religious demons
[1:09:11] i am ain't got time for it we're on our
[1:09:14] way out of his things we're going to
[1:09:15] reach them you're going to see how close
[1:09:17] it really is there's no way that's why
[1:09:20] the past i don't have the quotes but
[1:09:22] i'll find it for you that's why you hear
[1:09:25] the pastor keep saying you gotta keep up
[1:09:28] don't fall behind
[1:09:30] you gotta keep up
[1:09:32] because the prophet of god said when
[1:09:34] they was getting ready to come out of
[1:09:36] egypt
[1:09:37] it has to be a coming out and going in
[1:09:40] but the blood
[1:09:42] the blood
[1:09:44] had to be on the doorpost
[1:09:47] the blood today is the holy ghost
[1:09:50] and life has to be there
[1:09:52] so the blood has to be on the doorpost
[1:09:55] and he was teaching them
[1:09:57] now you sit there
[1:09:59] don't forget this time
[1:10:01] my brothers my sister children
[1:10:03] he said this is never forget this is
[1:10:05] going to be the passover
[1:10:07] this is going to be the time we exiting
[1:10:10] out of here is that right
[1:10:12] so the death angel was going to strike
[1:10:15] but they had to keep up with what moses
[1:10:18] was teaching them while they were
[1:10:20] sitting and waiting
[1:10:22] [Music]
[1:10:28] that's why the pastor said you got to
[1:10:29] keep up
[1:10:31] it's heaviness on his heart when you see
[1:10:34] him and he said how many of y'all listen
[1:10:35] to the message
[1:10:39] see don't be lying don't let no lion
[1:10:41] spirit get on you
[1:10:43] you just have to know why because you
[1:10:45] got a god that's rich in what mercy
[1:10:48] lord have mercy on me father huh
[1:10:57] look what he says
[1:10:59] we know
[1:11:01] the ministry is sent
[1:11:04] by the words of the god from a word from
[1:11:07] the lord
[1:11:08] let me keep going because i want to get
[1:11:10] through a lot of this he said now look
[1:11:13] he said natalie part of you are a part
[1:11:15] of god you as always he says don't
[1:11:17] remember it because you are only a
[1:11:19] attribute in god that's why i said you
[1:11:21] don't remember it's just in your mind
[1:11:23] don't worry about it see that's why
[1:11:24] those 10 spies that went out there those
[1:11:26] 12 spies went out there is that right
[1:11:28] brother branham called the other 10 that
[1:11:30] came back with a negative report what he
[1:11:32] called him a lion preachers is that
[1:11:33] right but the next time when he had to
[1:11:35] go in there over there with rahab what
[1:11:37] he said leave them lying preachers there
[1:11:39] i only need two huh bring me a witness
[1:11:43] somebody that god's working faith that's
[1:11:45] working by love send me them
[1:11:48] he said look what he says he said you
[1:11:50] were only his thinking you were but your
[1:11:53] very name
[1:11:54] if it was was on the book of life it was
[1:11:57] put there before the foundation of the
[1:12:00] world he knew he knew what you were he
[1:12:03] says i'm only saying this not to mix up
[1:12:06] doctrine but to straighten it out
[1:12:09] you see what i'm saying he ought to
[1:12:10] straighten it out because when you start
[1:12:12] talking about foreign or predestination
[1:12:16] it shakes some of them out there than
[1:12:17] religious demons you know you know
[1:12:19] you're going up against those religious
[1:12:21] demons and they believe that they write
[1:12:23] by the letter he was saying by the
[1:12:26] letter but the letter killed him and the
[1:12:28] spirit give life is that right
[1:12:30] paul said but i was not disobedient of
[1:12:33] the heavenly vision that was given unto
[1:12:35] me paul set up under one of the best
[1:12:37] teachers in the land is that right
[1:12:39] hungarian he said abandon but the
[1:12:43] chameleon come in camellia and i didn't
[1:12:45] see nowhere with chameleon come in but i
[1:12:48] see where paul came in is all by
[1:12:50] election for knowledge and
[1:12:53] predestinated empowers the pharisees of
[1:12:56] the pharisees but paul on the road to
[1:13:00] persecute christians and he was there
[1:13:03] rich immersing he was blinded is that
[1:13:06] right when paul was blinded out there
[1:13:09] and when he got on there he had to go
[1:13:11] down and got blinding for three days but
[1:13:13] the scales was on his eyes but god uh a
[1:13:17] man like paul his name was saul he
[1:13:20] persecute christians he'll throw you in
[1:13:22] jail he'll have you stoned the dancer
[1:13:25] but what he was a chosen vessel to do uh
[1:13:29] to the gentiles to be a great light god
[1:13:33] rich and mercy somebody was on drugs but
[1:13:37] god hid them rich in mercy delivered
[1:13:40] them somebody was out there stealing god
[1:13:43] reaching mercy delivered them somebody
[1:13:45] was a lesbian god rich in mercy
[1:13:49] delivered them somebody was a drug
[1:13:51] addict god rich and mercy and delivered
[1:13:54] them
[1:13:56] god
[1:13:58] oh rich in mercy
[1:14:00] thank you jesus
[1:14:01] help us lord he said look
[1:14:05] he says i'm slain
[1:14:07] but
[1:14:08] to straighten it out
[1:14:10] he said that we might get away from this
[1:14:12] what this fear in being scared
[1:14:18] when you bring into the knowledge
[1:14:21] you're a son of the most high god
[1:14:26] you come from god you're going back to
[1:14:28] god
[1:14:30] you don't have to fear anything
[1:14:33] the last thing is that you what the holy
[1:14:35] spirit show us
[1:14:37] you can't even speak depth on yourself
[1:14:40] david couldn't even speak depth on
[1:14:43] himself
[1:14:44] it because why no one had right jesus
[1:14:48] had everything under his feet except for
[1:14:51] what death is that right
[1:14:54] let it sink in a hidden mystery a hidden
[1:14:58] nugget people say well
[1:15:00] why are they on the mysteries why they
[1:15:02] gotta have all the mysteries what are
[1:15:03] you under mystery for because of what
[1:15:06] it's going to increase our faith we got
[1:15:08] to have the mystery before we move into

[1:18:32] he says you don't you don't know who you
[1:18:34] are
[1:18:35] you're not going
[1:18:37] going to be
[1:18:38] but now you are sons of god
[1:18:42] it says see
[1:18:43] you always were the sons of god
[1:18:46] for god when god had you in his thinking
[1:18:50] at the beginning you were to be part of
[1:18:52] he was the part of you your life that's
[1:18:55] in you now
[1:18:56] had to be with god before there you see
[1:19:01] beautiful he says many of you can
[1:19:03] fellowship with that let me drop down by
[1:19:05] the grace of god he said now
[1:19:08] and after a while
[1:19:10] you heard the gospel see
[1:19:13] maybe you went to church you picked out
[1:19:15] his this and that and went from
[1:19:17] denomination to the denomination but one
[1:19:19] day
[1:19:20] you being part of god
[1:19:23] you are part of the word and when you
[1:19:25] heard the word you know where you come
[1:19:28] from you know that what was the truth
[1:19:32] you were always the seed
[1:19:35] was in you always he says the word when
[1:19:39] the word that was in you
[1:19:42] that was before the foundation of the
[1:19:44] world the word and you coming in
[1:19:46] together
[1:19:47] look and see what god is doing and we're
[1:19:50] now becoming one with god we are
[1:19:54] partnerships with god is that right so
[1:19:57] in this hour here now we have to realize
[1:20:01] that god is so rich in mercy we want you
[1:20:04] to see once you see your position and
[1:20:07] what he's put you here for
[1:20:09] help me lord
[1:20:11] he said now look
[1:20:13] i'ma jump a little bit
[1:20:15] he says
[1:20:18] let me skip that course we know he's you
[1:20:20] know you that is born of god that's
[1:20:21] first john 3 and 8. your dad is born
[1:20:23] born of god you cannot sin and we know
[1:20:26] sin is unbelief here that is born of god
[1:20:28] you cannot sin so you're not doubting
[1:20:31] the word you're here because there's
[1:20:32] something inside of you god put in there
[1:20:34] before the foundation of the world
[1:20:36] that's why he said you just have to sit
[1:20:38] back
[1:20:39] because you're eagles
[1:20:41] huh
[1:20:42] the egos
[1:20:43] you see those little birds out there
[1:20:45] when you see those little birds flying
[1:20:46] [Music]
[1:20:51] they work in the fly they working hard
[1:20:53] to fly
[1:20:56] [Music]
[1:21:01] [Applause]
[1:21:12] look what he said
[1:21:14] he said now
[1:21:16] think of this
[1:21:17] help me lord we're going to jump a
[1:21:19] little bit
[1:21:21] he said now look we know god rich in
[1:21:24] mercy always from the old testament we
[1:21:27] know when noah and god noah found grace
[1:21:29] and mercy in the eye sights of god is
[1:21:31] that right
[1:21:33] because god did what predestinate noah
[1:21:36] to go through it before the foundation
[1:21:38] of the world is that right
[1:21:40] but before that he has noah had to keep
[1:21:43] an eye on who enoch is that right
[1:21:46] the religious demons they're going to be
[1:21:48] keeping their eyes on us the sons of the
[1:21:51] prophet will be keeping their eyes on us
[1:21:55] when we rapture out of here the sons of
[1:21:58] god we will be gone so we are watching
[1:22:01] the spirit that was on elijah is that
[1:22:04] right the great ego it was the spirit of
[1:22:08] elijah that had to come
[1:22:10] five times and the spirit of elijah was
[1:22:13] the anointing of christ out of malachi
[1:22:16] 4. luke 17 30 revelations 10 7. is that
[1:22:21] right so that's why we get our message
[1:22:24] we get it from god
[1:22:26] anyone that don't follow this message
[1:22:28] they're not going to make it hallelujah
[1:22:32] because we're not going through the
[1:22:34] tribulation
[1:22:36] the church goes through the tribulation
[1:22:39] see but his bride we goes in the rapture
[1:22:43] is that right going and coming there
[1:22:45] coming out and going in is that right
[1:22:50] help me lord i'm trying to go slow he
[1:22:53] says now look he says help me god rich
[1:22:56] in mercy
[1:22:57] he says you can talk to people sometimes
[1:23:00] on the streets about about the lord they
[1:23:02] laugh right in your face
[1:23:04] suppose but they what they supposed to
[1:23:07] do that
[1:23:08] had to meet with people fussing about
[1:23:10] the two spirits
[1:23:12] i'm saying
[1:23:14] that's not even a conversation that's
[1:23:16] not even something to meet on
[1:23:18] because god said they was going to be
[1:23:20] here in the last days
[1:23:23] so if it wasn't then he was a liar but
[1:23:25] he's not so what we're looking at here
[1:23:28] now certain things you just don't pay no
[1:23:30] attention to you're supposed to be
[1:23:32] mocked you're supposed to be laughed at
[1:23:35] you're supposed to be talked about but
[1:23:37] you are what the eagles is that right
[1:23:40] he said but now look he talked he said
[1:23:42] there is no man can come to me except my
[1:23:45] father what
[1:23:46] that's exactly right brother that's why
[1:23:49] the holy spirit was saying when
[1:23:51] the holy spirit was saying sunday humber
[1:23:54] charles what'd he say he said is because
[1:23:57] how our parents used to say you can't
[1:23:59] get blood
[1:24:00] out of a turnip
[1:24:02] they can't receive it because they're
[1:24:05] blinded
[1:24:06] and then that they're not of god
[1:24:09] but they're of the devil
[1:24:10] so that see that's why they caused jesus
[1:24:13] what bl's about but they could not see
[1:24:16] him as being the anointed messiah
[1:24:20] let us sink in we're not talking about
[1:24:22] the people that's in those systems
[1:24:25] there's good people and we pray for them
[1:24:27] because remember the brandon tabernacle
[1:24:30] they had to get that branham tabernacle
[1:24:32] bill and it was a catholic brother that
[1:24:34] helped brother branham and them get that
[1:24:37] get that building built okay so you got
[1:24:40] to watch that's why he said you watch
[1:24:42] them according to the spirit is that
[1:24:45] right he's learning the man by their
[1:24:47] spirit because you could be wrong in
[1:24:49] your doctrine but right in your spirit
[1:24:51] and you could be right in your spirit
[1:24:53] but you could be wrong in your doctrine
[1:24:55] so now that's why we're saying you don't
[1:24:57] want to be so dogmatic about things is
[1:25:00] what we're against is the system not the
[1:25:04] people
[1:25:05] hallelujah because god is what rich in
[1:25:09] mercy is that right
[1:25:11] and that little catholic you know what
[1:25:14] he better died here as a catholic but he
[1:25:16] gonna make it in
[1:25:19] ah
[1:25:21] i still
[1:25:22] i i'm still a quote from the pastor's uh
[1:25:24] um book because why because the prophet
[1:25:27] of god
[1:25:28] is the pastor of the age
[1:25:31] and he can pull a special bullet is that
[1:25:33] right
[1:25:37] it's time to recognize what god has
[1:25:40] given us god in christ is one
[1:25:44] the prophet is the prophet he's the
[1:25:46] messenger he's the pastor of the entire
[1:25:50] age
[1:25:53] your pastor is the pastor of the local
[1:25:56] assembly
[1:25:58] that's why you talk and felt with your
[1:26:01] pastor
[1:26:02] if something is on your heart and you
[1:26:04] need to get with him and you single you
[1:26:07] need to talk to the pastor because he
[1:26:10] has a special bullet that can get grace
[1:26:14] from god that the other officers can't
[1:26:17] get is that right
[1:26:19] so the pastor of your household is the
[1:26:22] head is that right
[1:26:24] you got you the head of the household is
[1:26:27] the father he's the pastor of his
[1:26:30] household
[1:26:31] that's why people are so confused is
[1:26:34] because god is doing what restoring is
[1:26:37] that right what the power worm the conga
[1:26:40] caterpillar and the locusts have eaten
[1:26:42] up what all of these religious demons
[1:26:45] have eaten up so they saying it's too
[1:26:48] strict it's too hard it's not that it's
[1:26:51] too strict and it's too hard it's just
[1:26:54] you have to understand god is rich in
[1:26:57] mercy but some is just not part of us
[1:27:01] it's just that this what we're getting
[1:27:03] is for believers saint is for believe us
[1:27:11] why because we're rich in mercy if god
[1:27:14] is rich in mercy
[1:27:15] we're rich in mercy
[1:27:19] and you can extrude extend grace to
[1:27:21] someone
[1:27:22] you can extend eternal life to someone
[1:27:25] eternal life to someone
[1:27:27] when you go to your father we don't go
[1:27:30] as to our father as as beggars is that
[1:27:33] right
[1:27:34] you say what how do we say that's right
[1:27:36] brother abel we say our father
[1:27:39] ah
[1:27:42] which are in heaven
[1:27:44] ah hallow
[1:27:47] holy be thy name
[1:27:49] thy what thy kingdom come thy holy ghost
[1:27:53] come so that thy what will can be done
[1:27:57] on earth as it was in
[1:28:02] you don't go to your father begging you
[1:28:05] don't have to go to him begging you're a
[1:28:08] son you're a daughter of the most high
[1:28:11] god
[1:28:14] huh
[1:28:16] huh sister sharon more than a conqueror
[1:28:19] oh
[1:28:20] honey she went to a pass she get the
[1:28:23] double portion is that right she got a
[1:28:25] pasta pasta
[1:28:29] oh i lost my watch he didn't watch
[1:28:33] what's too hard for the pastor ah
[1:28:37] father huh
[1:28:39] because he'd be what extended mercy to
[1:28:42] you and he extended the mercy and the
[1:28:45] lord allowed him to do what find that
[1:28:48] watch hallelujah
[1:28:53] help me lord he said now look
[1:28:56] he said there is no man can come to me
[1:28:59] except my father job god has to draw
[1:29:01] them there has to be a life there
[1:29:04] there has to be a life in that seat
[1:29:08] he says in all that he has given me what
[1:29:12] will come that's right brother saying
[1:29:14] will come
[1:29:15] he says why
[1:29:17] he made a provision for those who wants
[1:29:20] to be redeemed
[1:29:22] he made a provision for those who want
[1:29:24] to be healed
[1:29:26] and because he that did this makes him
[1:29:29] what rich in mercy
[1:29:32] as he was always being rich in mercy
[1:29:36] it must be if you refuse this
[1:29:39] there is nothing left but the judgment
[1:29:42] because sin
[1:29:43] must be judged
[1:29:46] you're moving on things
[1:29:48] that's why he's trying to bring you up
[1:29:50] and bring you into now so that you can
[1:29:53] receive the grace and the mercy that's
[1:29:55] extended from god he said now look
[1:29:59] he said we know that pharaoh
[1:30:01] pharaoh came near type of the devil he
[1:30:04] was an
[1:30:04] impersonator when it was time for him to
[1:30:07] come out of egypt
[1:30:08] and pharaoh pursued them
[1:30:10] god rich in mercy
[1:30:12] open that dead sea is that right
[1:30:15] he stood the walls up he sent the east
[1:30:17] winds can you imagine almighty god
[1:30:20] froze froze the ocean stood it up and he
[1:30:24] froze
[1:30:25] had it standing inside and the only way
[1:30:28] for you to go through it got to be by
[1:30:31] faith
[1:30:32] ah
[1:30:34] it got to be by faith
[1:30:36] so he did he says what
[1:30:38] they said and then looked
[1:30:39] pharaoh was behind them is that right we
[1:30:42] said it's because with the blood it was
[1:30:44] the atonement is that right pharaoh was
[1:30:47] behind them he said the walls were
[1:30:49] standing up the dead sea was in front of
[1:30:51] them before god paul did he said what
[1:30:54] why cry speak he said do what stand
[1:30:58] still and see what salvation of the lord
[1:31:03] prophet of god said that
[1:31:05] moses stepped out there by faith brother
[1:31:07] sam and he stepped down there by faith
[1:31:10] and he said he parted the sea and when
[1:31:12] he stepped down he parted the sea
[1:31:15] he stole this way
[1:31:21] [Music]
[1:31:25] he said now stand still and see the
[1:31:28] salvation of the lord and he went
[1:31:31] through and they had to walk on through
[1:31:35] help me lord
[1:31:37] look what he says
[1:31:39] now that's the only way he said but god
[1:31:42] rich in mercy
[1:31:43] the escape for the hebrew children
[1:31:45] because they were following
[1:31:47] look what it was they were following
[1:31:50] in line
[1:31:52] with the duty they were following the
[1:31:56] word you miss
[1:31:59] your mercy and you're great sometimes
[1:32:01] because you don't follow the word word
[1:32:04] you don't do it according to what god
[1:32:07] tell you to do
[1:32:09] so that's what that's how they got their
[1:32:11] deliverance what they need they were
[1:32:13] following the word of god for their day
[1:32:17] and the word of god come on eagles wings
[1:32:20] and their eagles wings is the prophets
[1:32:23] it had to come on the word of a prophet
[1:32:27] so that's why we're not lifting up no
[1:32:29] man
[1:32:30] but we know by revelation
[1:32:34] that it had to come by the anointing of
[1:32:37] elijah in the last days is that right
[1:32:42] let it sink in
[1:32:47] god's grace
[1:32:48] and god's mercy he says now that's the
[1:32:51] only way to obtain mercy is to follow
[1:32:53] the instructions that god has given us
[1:32:56] to follow
[1:32:57] he said that's the only way he can show
[1:32:59] mercy is when we follow what he said
[1:33:03] he said now look
[1:33:06] hallelujah look what he says here
[1:33:10] you must follow god's provided way
[1:33:13] he says can you see what i mean
[1:33:15] he said now look
[1:33:17] when they came down when they came
[1:33:20] through the red sea the same word
[1:33:24] that drowned pharaoh
[1:33:26] was the same word
[1:33:28] that granted deliverance for the hebrew
[1:33:30] children is that right
[1:33:32] because they was following the way of
[1:33:34] the anointed prophet for that day
[1:33:37] that was the grace that was sent to them
[1:33:39] for that day
[1:33:41] so we have to understand in each age god
[1:33:44] always send them
[1:33:46] a messenger to show his grace and his
[1:33:49] mercy to his children let me keep going
[1:33:52] he says now we are he says now
[1:33:55] he says that can we see what i mean
[1:33:58] people who don't believe in divine
[1:34:00] healing you can't make them believe
[1:34:01] those that don't believe in the baptism
[1:34:03] of the holy ghost see
[1:34:05] god is rich in mercy to those who will
[1:34:07] follow after him not after creed but
[1:34:10] after god god is the word and it was
[1:34:13] made flesh and dwelt among us now and
[1:34:15] that he might bring forth what other
[1:34:18] attributes of god
[1:34:20] hear what we're saying the body jesus
[1:34:22] was the body of god
[1:34:25] the body
[1:34:27] the body
[1:34:29] now you're the body of god the body of
[1:34:32] jesus christ now he's moving in the
[1:34:34] midst of us by the holy spirit is that
[1:34:37] right that's why the holy spirit say if
[1:34:40] you don't find
[1:34:42] if you don't find
[1:34:45] to follow the word of god for your day
[1:34:48] so the holy spirit you're still having
[1:34:50] trouble with the heels
[1:34:53] huh

[1:41:53] look what he says
[1:41:54] help me lord
[1:41:56] he says we find that god is so merciful
[1:41:59] he said now look
[1:42:01] he says then god
[1:42:03] he says and when any believer comes to
[1:42:05] god
[1:42:06] he becomes god's attribute of his words
[1:42:10] he is used to manifest the word that's
[1:42:12] promised for that day
[1:42:14] he said god is rich in mercy
[1:42:17] has never left us without a testimony
[1:42:20] he's never left us without a testimony
[1:42:23] each and every one of us should have a
[1:42:26] testimony god said prove me
[1:42:29] prove me try your faith
[1:42:31] huh
[1:42:32] let me keep going hallelujah
[1:42:35] he said now
[1:42:36] god always
[1:42:38] listen i'm still a god rich in mercy i'm
[1:42:41] in one message
[1:42:43] the god who is rich in mercy
[1:42:45] i'm at paragraph 76 now god always
[1:42:49] liking his prophets to eagles and what
[1:42:51] is that he said moses was his messenger
[1:42:54] he says and they were following moses
[1:42:56] and that
[1:42:57] that was the eagle's wings you see and
[1:43:00] they were carried because he was packing
[1:43:02] what god's message
[1:43:05] william branham was packing what god's
[1:43:07] message
[1:43:09] the elect is that right he was bringing
[1:43:11] for the elect in his last stage he said
[1:43:14] look what he did so you have to
[1:43:16] understand god always send a messenger
[1:43:19] in every age
[1:43:21] so we have to understand his grace
[1:43:23] brother branham talked about i think
[1:43:25] he's back in token you got to go into
[1:43:27] in in 61 or 60 i think 11
[1:43:30] in 11th month he talked about it in
[1:43:32] token is that but he talked about
[1:43:35] god always send a messenger a message
[1:43:38] with an anointing on every age is that
[1:43:41] right he said the old testament who are
[1:43:44] they saying he send the two messengers
[1:43:46] down to sodom and gomorrah is that right
[1:43:49] he said but the messenger for our age
[1:43:52] was still there because it had not came
[1:43:54] was that right to the gentile age so he
[1:43:58] hadn't came yet
[1:43:59] but god had what luther is that right
[1:44:02] wesley is that right the pentecostal
[1:44:05] times but he also had billy graham he
[1:44:09] said billy graham was the type of what
[1:44:11] grace is that right
[1:44:13] he said oral robbers was the type of the
[1:44:15] power the power of the pentecost is that
[1:44:18] right he said but now he had to sin the
[1:44:21] anointing of malachi 4 was the anointing
[1:44:24] of who christ back in his church again
[1:44:28] back on the scene he never left us
[1:44:30] without a sign so that's when he came he
[1:44:33] was discerning the thoughts and the
[1:44:36] intents of the heart that he was using
[1:44:38] to william mary and branham to let them
[1:44:41] know this is the last sign of the age is
[1:44:45] that right
[1:44:46] now the only thing we got left is doing
[1:44:48] what he's unfolding the mysteries with
[1:44:52] understanding the resurrected christ is
[1:44:55] now moving us in the closer of going
[1:44:58] home saints
[1:45:03] look what he says he says now
[1:45:06] god always likens probably the eagles he
[1:45:09] says to them
[1:45:10] and they were following moses that was
[1:45:13] packing the message and the people
[1:45:15] followed that
[1:45:16] he says they were following god as they
[1:45:18] as they follow moses with his message of
[1:45:22] deliverance you hear that let it sink in
[1:45:25] anybody try to accuse you and say you
[1:45:27] following a man
[1:45:28] no no no no no you take it to moses
[1:45:31] hallelujah
[1:45:33] he said now look
[1:45:35] just give me a few more minutes he says
[1:45:38] god they follow moses with his message
[1:45:41] of deliverance
[1:45:43] and the bible said that
[1:45:44] he that perished not with them who
[1:45:47] believed not see because god was rich in
[1:45:50] mercy
[1:45:51] because they were following his
[1:45:54] commandments
[1:45:56] he said god wants us to follow his what
[1:45:59] his commandments
[1:46:00] that's what god's wanting us to go he
[1:46:02] went out on what eagles wings is that
[1:46:05] right
[1:46:06] you could go to exodus 19 i don't have
[1:46:08] time to turn to those scriptures exodus
[1:46:10] 19 you can go to romans 3 when i first
[1:46:13] started telling you about the the grace
[1:46:16] and it runs all the way to chapter 8.
[1:46:18] you can go read it and see what paul was
[1:46:20] trying to tell them by the mercies of
[1:46:22] god i beseech you brother i'm begging
[1:46:25] i'm pleading with you by the mercies of
[1:46:27] god always remember the mercies because
[1:46:29] his mercy no matter how low you get no
[1:46:32] matter how much the devil try to beat
[1:46:34] you no matter how where you error
[1:46:36] because you're going to be tried and
[1:46:38] tested you are not going to possess the
[1:46:40] gates of your enemy until after the
[1:46:43] trial
[1:46:44] that's when you will be tried and tested
[1:46:46] is that right but you will come out like
[1:46:48] gold saints hallelujah look what he says
[1:46:52] let's go to luke 15. i'll see if i can't
[1:46:56] cram it in if god give me grace
[1:47:00] i guess we say y'all
[1:47:02] say all that by the grace of god
[1:47:04] he said now look
[1:47:08] says now
[1:47:09] let's look at here at verse 3 luke 15
[1:47:12] and 3 and he spake he spake this parable
[1:47:15] unto them saying what man of you having
[1:47:17] a hundred sheep if you lose one of them
[1:47:20] do not leave the 99 in the wilderness
[1:47:22] and go after after that which is lost
[1:47:25] until he find it and when he had found
[1:47:27] it he layeth it on his shoulder and do
[1:47:29] what
[1:47:30] do what
[1:47:32] now that's why we said last time the joy
[1:47:35] of the lord is my wife
[1:47:37] the whole heaven rejoice over what one
[1:47:40] center that coming to what repentance is
[1:47:42] that right because you know you see how
[1:47:45] powerful it is one soul come to
[1:47:47] repentance it's all a joy let's go over
[1:47:50] here now i'm gonna jump a little bit the
[1:47:51] lost coin from the last coin i'm going
[1:47:54] to just paraphrase it a little bit so
[1:47:55] you can understand over there verse some
[1:47:58] if you're writing it down is luke 15 and
[1:48:00] verse 8. remember the woman at that time
[1:48:03] back then
[1:48:05] when she had a tablet and they had a
[1:48:07] tablet at that time it's not like they
[1:48:09] got a wedding band back in that day you
[1:48:11] got a tablet and they got a paddle
[1:48:13] around their head you know brother
[1:48:15] branham typed this with the second
[1:48:17] coming of the lord and when he came in
[1:48:19] and he talked about the second coming of
[1:48:21] the lord you got to go over to galatians
[1:48:23] and five and type it in there but when
[1:48:26] they came in in that tablet you know it
[1:48:28] had a it's self-examining kind it was
[1:48:30] check-up time she lost that one tablet
[1:48:33] out of there that coin out of that
[1:48:35] tablet but she knew if she didn't find
[1:48:37] that coin in the old testament you would
[1:48:39] be considered a harlot you could
[1:48:41] consider a a prostitute is that
[1:48:43] right and then you know that puts you
[1:48:45] they could put you away but now we there
[1:48:48] you have to know that the time is
[1:48:50] winding up saints we're getting close so
[1:48:52] we have to realize her husband was about
[1:48:55] to come home and she had to find that
[1:48:57] coin and she knew she had to fight so
[1:48:59] she started doing what house cleaning is
[1:49:02] that right she had to start house
[1:49:04] cleaning she had to start examining
[1:49:06] herself and after he started examining
[1:49:09] herself she had to make sure that she
[1:49:11] had to get that coin is that right and
[1:49:13] once she got that coin in there she did
[1:49:16] what she rejoiced is that right she went
[1:49:18] and she praised the lord and she was
[1:49:20] telling them look what she said she said
