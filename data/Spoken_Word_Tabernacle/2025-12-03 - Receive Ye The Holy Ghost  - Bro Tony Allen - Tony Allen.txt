So my husband had a surprise trip where he wanted us to travel with him, but he didn't didn't tell me like he told me like two days before. So when he told me I didn't like it. I didn't like it. I'm like, "Oh, where are we going? I don't want to go. You did not prepare me." He's like, "I'm sorry, but you have to pack." So we did. We did. We went biking with my children. Then we went then he sent me a quote where about the B was say was saying about the trip to go with the children. He sent me the quote. So when I write the quote I'm like oh I can say nothing. I say amen. I say amen to the court. So let's go. So when we went there he was he was supposed to dedicate the the house of one of our sister and invisible audience family. So he did he did not tell them that we were coming to dedicate the house. He was trying to surprise them. So when we got there we got home nobody was home. Only the brother was home. So he explained to the brother that we came for this and this. The brother said, "My my wife is at work." I called the wife. The wife was in shock. She was like, "Why you didn't tell me?" I'm like, "Your pastor didn't tell me. I could not tell you." So the sister say, "Okay, no problem. We're going to meet." Then when we uh we got there and we have another family from Florida. So I thought they are they are living in the the same the same city where we went Orlando as texture that we here but the sister did not answer me. Then uh we returned to the hotel where we were with my husband and the children. The sister sent me a message that they are exactly in the city where we are. that when my husband put the the address on the on the telephone, it was showing we are about uh 30 minute apart. So my husband say it's 12 a.m. we cannot go. It's it's too it's too late. So we didn't go on Saturday. The the family where was supposed to dedicate the house uh asked to come back on Saturday. We went there on Saturday and the sister invited so many people They came the very same day. Then when they came, the pastor start preaching about about dedication, the meaning of it. But as he was preaching, the Holy Ghost was so strong in the house. It's just the dedication, but the Holy Ghost was so strong. I thought I was the only one who felt it. But when I got the testimony from the owner of the house, she told me so many people testify about it. Some of the unbeliever, they also asking for for us to start like a church over there. Then I told my sister, say sister, ask them to pray. Ask them to pray about it because I don't know. So everything went well. The dedication was so good. So the next day we were supposed to catch our flight. My husband tried again the address of our sister when we were in the hotel. It turned out to be they were close to us 15 minutes. So we are like okay we going there. We got there. It was a blessing when we met. The sister told me say, "Sister Chevron, we were coming to North Carolina to surprise you guys." But they are in Florida, Miami. But when we we we the car we rented was broken. When we got to Jacksonville, my husband say like, "Okay, let's go to Orlando just to visit people." When I opened the phone, I saw your message. You are here. I told my husband, "This is God." So we went we met over there we we share about the words we got there at 11 and we left there maybe at 1 something before we get the the before getting the plane. So the brother and the sister they were with their younger sister who was newly engaged. So we start sharing about the word uh how to quote a a girl all those stuff and they told then the man said pastor we are many of us in here in Florida a bunch of us what I'm going to ask you what we want is a church in Florida that's the other family so Stephven was like I don't know about it so pray pray about it so I'm like but Stephen we need to pray. But the the things that we really that I really enjoy was how God orchestrate things to to make the account to be broken so that we can meet then he can share the word with this brother and the presence of God in the house as we are praying. So I thank everyone of you for praying for us and I want to tell the sister when your husband tell you let's go even if you don't like it just go because you don't know what the Lord has for you. I enjoyed the trip like I never never enjoy any trip. God bless you. God bless brother Stephen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you brother Stephen. Amen.

They just could not do it. So they ended up airlifting him to Charleston and when he got there the condition was so bad um we I believe we put it on the zoom and we prayed for it and and then the Wednesday we came here we prayed some more that bad condition I don't know how to put this um he got so better that he they had to send him home. &gt;&gt; So, church of the living God, I am telling you, we are serving the living God. &gt;&gt; And the zoom, the zoom is not a joke. &gt;&gt; When we get in that zoom, we are in connection &gt;&gt; with heaven. &gt;&gt; Why don't we all stand?

God is winning every day and the devil is losing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. This prayer service on Tuesday is powerful. &gt;&gt; If you don't know, I don't know where you are, but I see God doing things. There is uh a woman. She's not even a message believer. She she she work if I'm not mistaken with sister Adasa. She put a prayer request and she requested the link and they asked me if I would allow her to get in the zoom link. I say go ahead and give the link and she jump on it and you seen her daughter coming up like Amelia yesterday and they put a request yesterday. This woman put an application sixth time and was declined and and she put an application the seventh time and she stopped at uh at a food store or a fast food or something trying to get something to eat for $22 and she got declined. Her car declined because she didn't have the fund. $22. And then we pray with her on Tuesday. And today, by God's grace, she received a letter. She has been sent me a check of $2,200. &gt;&gt; Amen. She tells I tell your church, God is working. Amen. God is working. &gt;&gt; Can you imagine those numbers? &gt;&gt; Are those number telling you something? &gt;&gt; $22. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; She got declined trying to get food because of the condition that she was going on. And she received an approval the seventh time, an approval of $2,200. So, so this times 100. &gt;&gt; So maybe when she got declined, she was worrying about it. She didn't know God was giving her her number right there. &gt;&gt; And the next day, $2,200. So I saw the letter. They even took a screenshot and sent me the letter. I saw the letter coming up. $2,200 a 100 time God gave. &gt;&gt; God is alive. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You see Sister Olivia right there? &gt;&gt; Do you see her right there? It's a miracle. &gt;&gt; If I show you the picture &gt;&gt; of how she was and how the devil attacked her twice &gt;&gt; and how she is today, this is a miracle. It looks like nothing happened. until you see the picture. Her face was swollen and everything swollen up. I saw the picture. They come I mean from uh Florida, wherever I got the message, the face was swollen up twice. And by God grace, she's standing right there on the post of duty singing and everything back to normal. Church, God is doing things beyond our brain. You have no clue. I'm talking I was talking about transplant here and then uh a healing and God touched sister AOS and another sister in Florida got healed. &gt;&gt; Church only God will let us know. Brother brother Glenn keep telling me this all the time. And he say only on the other side &gt;&gt; that we will realize what God is doing right here. Amen. There are people that are desiring to be right here sitting right here. They are they are even praying and because of their job and being there being in a certain place for years and trying to move. It's a difficult brother. Only when you go out you begin to realize what God is doing. The people that my wife told you that were invited there were not message believer. &gt;&gt; There were 20 something people if I'm not mistaken. Only one two people the remaining all of them denominational people. It's on it's uh it's over there. It's recording. They were not message believer. And you should feel the presence of the Lord. And you should feel how people begin to pray in that house. And one even uh send a message. They say tell that pastor he should have come and pray for my house too. So I know I got few houses here that I need to visit. Please allow me. Give me some time. We work with my schedule. Don't get mad. You say, "Brother Stephen, you left me here. You went all the way to Florida to dedicate a home over there." I will try. My schedule is packed and booked left and right. We will try to work things out. But it is good. Sister Sheron is happy. People say you don't go to vacation. You don't go to And I'm just sitting quiet. I said, "One day you will learn." Amen. And I schedule everything. She didn't know. I just keep saying, "Oh, no. We need to get to the vacation." Say, "Keep you you just keep moving." Until I pulled the trigger and say, "Okay, get in. Where are we going? Are we going alone?" I say, "I'm going to go with you. Get in." But now everybody came relax and we praise the Lord and thank you for allowing us and giving us a time. Today it is our convention. I'm not preaching. Brother Tony Allen is preaching. By God's grace, brother Tony has been a tremendous help, helping brother John with the music and then picking up where sister Yuk is on a honeymoon and then deacon here and minister, a man of many heart, brother Michael. Amen. So, but by God's grace, we are in the midst of people that are gifted. Let's cherish one another. Cherish the gift and embrace it and nurture that because God help us. It's easy. It's very easy if we have a wedding right here to just go talk to sister Pam. &gt;&gt; It's very easy. It makes things simple. I just talk and I know I'm dealing with a believer and they're going to take care as a believer. And sometime they go beyond just because they wanted to make it look nicer. If I want a cooking, I can call sister. I can call sister so and so. I can and and it's a tre. You don't know what a tremendous blessing it is just to know that my things are handled by a believer. Somebody who believe the gospel like me. Amen. &gt;&gt; So we thank the Lord for each one of you and let's pull on the gift of the Lord as we call brother Tony tonight. Only believe. &gt;&gt; Oh believe. All we believe all things are possible. Only believe. Only believe. Oh, we believe all things are possible.

Um it's a privilege um just to be called on and we're glad to be here to be with the saints amongst the believers and it's good to see y'all back off your trip. It's it's it's a different thing when you see someone face to face. You know, we we we saw you on the Zoom last night, but face to face is a different feeling. &gt;&gt; It's a different u feeling. Um, &gt;&gt; and and I think about it on that day when we get to see Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; It's going to be so much different &gt;&gt; than what we have right here. Just to be able to look upon his face. &gt;&gt; It's not the same. &gt;&gt; I promise you, it will not be the same. &gt;&gt; It won't be the same. &gt;&gt; If you can get your Bibles, let's turn to the book of The book of Acts, chapter 2, verse 37. &gt;&gt; When you when you found it, you can just say, "Amen." &gt;&gt; Amen. Verse 37 reads, it says, "Now, now when they heard this, they were pricricked in their heart &gt;&gt; and said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, men and brethren, what shall we do?" Then Peter said unto them,"Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost." Verse 39 says, "For the promise is unto you." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; "And to your children, and to all that are far off." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Even as many as the Lord our God shall call. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. Be &gt;&gt; on. Bow your heads. Let's Lord God, we ask that you bless your word tonight, oh Father. Oh God, as we come to you, oh Lord God, with high expectations tonight, oh Father. Oh God, we didn't come to see your man tonight, oh Father, but we came to hear from your Holy Spirit, oh Father. Oh Lord God, I pray, oh God, that you touch every heart in here tonight, oh Father, all the desires of their hearts, the wants of their needs, oh God. And I'm sure you know all about them, oh Father, before we got here, oh God. Oh God, even their visible audience tonight, oh God, whatever their needs are tonight, oh God, I pray that you would reach through that channel, oh Father, and touch their bodies, oh God, and their hearts, oh God, and their minds, oh Father, and and and fill, oh God, their spirit, oh God, with whatever it is they have desire of tonight, oh Father. Oh God, we ask that you bless the remaining of the service, oh God, and we put it back in your hands in Jesus Christ's name we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; May be seated. I'm going to use for a s a short subject tonight. Receive ye the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Receive ye &gt;&gt; the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now, when we look in the scriptures, &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; It it it plainly states that this Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; is a promise. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It's a promise. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And and and if you don't mind, I would like to read this quote. &gt;&gt; This powerful quote that was in the group chat Brother Steven sent out. It was real powerful and I and I I must read it. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Yes, sir. is it it say it says in 1957 in Hebrews chapter 2 number one &gt;&gt; it said when God makes a promise in the Bible &gt;&gt; that's right &gt;&gt; he said I see a man here in a wheelchair &gt;&gt; he said when God makes a promise &gt;&gt; he is guilty &gt;&gt; of that promise &gt;&gt; unless he brings it to pass &gt;&gt; he &gt;&gt; it say God is guilty when he makes a promise And the scriptures are guilty until they are fulfilled. &gt;&gt; See there right there he say as a statement that God has made &gt;&gt; and it's God to be fulfilled or God is guilty. &gt;&gt; You see? So &gt;&gt; God has promised you the Holy Ghost tonight. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Let me take my time here tonight. I try not to rush and I want I want to go back because I I originally had planned to speak on something else and um I got up this morning I went to work and I was riding down the road and it dropped in my spirit said receive ye the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; and you know the you know me thinking as a man I'm like Lord this is the day of you know how can I change this up this is the day of so I was like well I'll take it home and pray over it and I you know when I came in the house I walked in the you know, we had the prophet was already playing and I said, "Well, Lord, if you you know, if this is the way you want me to go, then you you have your prophet to speak to me &gt;&gt; and I I didn't think about it no more." So, you know, I went to preparing to come up here tonight and um I noticed that the volume was turned a little low because I started shaving and and the and the noise from the Clippers was too loud. I couldn't hear what he was saying. And I was like, "Let me turn it up a little bit. If God gonna speak, I'm going to be right on time. So when I went to speaking and he was um praying um he had a prayer line going and he was basically was saying the moral of the prayer line was that I don't know these people they're strangers to me. You know how brother Brown praying. He was like if you if you believe you know that God can do this or do that he's like you know you you believe that God can tell me what your condition is. And um he went to the second or third person and he asked the brother, he was like, "Would you believe me if I tell you what it is that you have need of?" He said, "You he said, "You want the Holy Ghost?" &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he said, he said, "Uh, he said, "That's what you desire." He said, "Go away and receive ye the Holy Ghost." &gt;&gt; So I threw my hands up. I said, I said, "Thank you, Lord. Thank you. Thank you, Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's go to the book of Ezekiel. Ezekiel chapter 36. &gt;&gt; Ezekiel chapter 36. And we're going to start at verse 16. And if you read this story, you know that Ezekiel is uh caught up in a vision and God is God is telling him what he going to do, prophesying what he going to do, telling him what and he first started out, he was prophesying what he was going to do to the land. So, and then when he get down to verse 16, he start talking about the about his people. Start to talk about his people. &gt;&gt; And verse 16 &gt;&gt; says, "Moreover, the word of the Lord came unto me, saying, &gt;&gt; "Son of man, when the house of Israel dwelt in their own land, &gt;&gt; they defiled it by their own way." Right? &gt;&gt; He said, "And by their doings," he said, "Their way was before me as the uncleanness of a removed woman." So there was their way was very unclean to him. &gt;&gt; He said, "Wherefore I poured my fury upon them for the blood that they have shed upon the land and for the idols where wherewith they had polluted it." And he says in verse 19, he says, "And I scattered them among the heathen." &gt;&gt; "And they were dispersed through the countries according to their way and according to their doings, I judge them." &gt;&gt; Verse 20 say, "And when they enter into the heathen where they went, they profane my holy name." So they basically disrespected. Profing to disrespect my holy name. when they when they said when they said to them, "These are the people of the Lord and are gone forth out of his land." &gt;&gt; So God beginning to realize that &gt;&gt; he had caused them to go amongst the heathen, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; But now that they are out there, the the the the heathens are beginning to look at his people &gt;&gt; and and say, "Are these the people of God?" And and God are realizing that, okay, they're they're in a bad place right now, but most of all, it's making him look bad. &gt;&gt; It's making him look bad. &gt;&gt; He said, "But I had pity for my holy name." &gt;&gt; So he had pity for his name, &gt;&gt; which the house of Israel had profained among the heathen where they went. Verse 22 says, "Therefore say unto the house of Israel, thus sayith the Lord God, I do not this for your sakes, &gt;&gt; oh house of Israel, but for my holy name's sake, &gt;&gt; which you have profained among the heathen. &gt;&gt; Whether you went." &gt;&gt; So he telling you what I'm getting ready to do is is for me. &gt;&gt; It ain't it ain't even got nothing to do with you. &gt;&gt; I'm getting ready to do this for me. &gt;&gt; So I want you to I want you to pay close attention what is what he getting ready to do. He says, "And I will sanctify my great name." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; "Which was profained among the heathen." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Which you have profained in the midst of them, and the heathen shall know that I am the Lord. That's right. &gt;&gt; Say the Lord God, when I shall be sanctified in you before their eyes. &gt;&gt; So God is saying, I'm going to do a work in you. &gt;&gt; In this condition, I'm going to do a work in you. So they going to know that even though they thinking this type of way, they going to know that I am still the Lord our God. &gt;&gt; So that's how God has done you and me. We have came in this world as sinners, &gt;&gt; you know, speaking lies or whatever in in a messed up condition. But God said that he was going to put his spirit in us and he was going to show the world that that's my child, that's my son, that's my daughter before the foundation of the world. And I'm going to make them come to that. Don't go to make them come to that. &gt;&gt; Verse 25. What? Watch where he starts out. He said, "Then will I sprinkle &gt;&gt; clean water upon you." &gt;&gt; This is how he start the process. He going to clean. He going to clean them up. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; He said, "I will sprinkle clean water upon you and ye shall be clean." &gt;&gt; He said, "From all your filthiness &gt;&gt; and from all your idols will I cleanse you." &gt;&gt; That's right. In verse 26, he says, "A new heart, &gt;&gt; yes, sir, &gt;&gt; also will I give you." &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; And a new spirit &gt;&gt; will I put within you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He say, "And I will take away the stony heart &gt;&gt; out of your flesh, and I will give you an heart of flesh." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And then verse 27 says, "And I will put my spirit Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; within you, &gt;&gt; and cause you to walk in my statutes, sir. and you shall keep my judgments and do them. &gt;&gt; Yes, my brother. &gt;&gt; Now, you see, they they didn't ask for this. &gt;&gt; Now, what I want you to catch that or not, they did not ask for this cleansing. &gt;&gt; They did not ask for their heart to be changed. They did not ask for a new spirit. They did not ask for him to put his spirit inside that new spirit. But God knew that that were his people and he was not going to let them be lost. So he made a decision to bring them to that condition. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Verse 29, he said, "I will also save you from all your uncleanness, &gt;&gt; and I will call for the corn and will increase it." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And lay no famine upon you. &gt;&gt; He said, "And I will multiply the fruit of the tree, &gt;&gt; sir. &gt;&gt; And the increase of the field, sir. &gt;&gt; That you shall shall receive no more reproach &gt;&gt; or famine among the heathen. He say, "Then shall you remember your own evil ways &gt;&gt; and your doings that were not good, &gt;&gt; and shall load yourselves into your own sight, for your iniquities, and for your abominations." &gt;&gt; He say, "Not for your sakes. &gt;&gt; Do I do I this, say the Lord God, be it known unto you, be ashamed and confounded for your own ways, oh house of Israel." &gt;&gt; So, let's look at this. Amen. &gt;&gt; He says not for them, but for his sake, for his for his name's sake. &gt;&gt; That's exactly right. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; So, let's go to let's turn to the one second here. to see the devil is trying to mess with my tablet. Okay. And you might as well get off it. Amen. So when the message question and answer number four in 1964 is a they asked brother Bren a question, &gt;&gt; right? And they said, "Dear brother Brandon, what is the difference &gt;&gt; when Jesus breathed on the disciples and said, &gt;&gt; "Receive ye the Holy Ghost." That's it. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; He said, "And when they had to go up to the upper room to cherry it, &gt;&gt; Brother Brandon said it was a promise." &gt;&gt; Got it. &gt;&gt; He gave them. &gt;&gt; He breathed upon them his promise. &gt;&gt; He said, "Receive ye the Holy Ghost." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; He said it was a promise. &gt;&gt; He said they went to the upper room to wait. See, they went to the upper room to wait for the promise &gt;&gt; to be fulfilled. &gt;&gt; He said, "The same thing is when we lay hands upon you &gt;&gt; to be healed." &gt;&gt; He said, "Then you go on about your business &gt;&gt; waiting for the promise to be fulfilled." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; So, if you don't see attributes of the Holy Ghost, you just tar. You wait on the promise. &gt;&gt; He said the promise is given to you. And he said, "Wait on it." And I want I want to use the board tonight &gt;&gt; if it's okay. &gt;&gt; I want to use the board. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; First, I want to I want you to get this process. He said the first thing he that he told in Ezekiel when he started dealing with with his people, he said, "I'm going to give you a new heart." And number two, the second thing he says, "I'm going to give you a new spirit." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Now, this this spirit is not his spirit is what he talking about. He said, "I'm going to give you a new spirit." Yes sir. &gt;&gt; So ba basically he's not going to take away your old nature but he's going to revive it. &gt;&gt; You know what I'm saying? He going he going to give you a new spirit. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; And the last thing he says &gt;&gt; he's going to give you his spirit. &gt;&gt; He's going to put his spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. in I put in the in in in the middle &gt;&gt; of the new spirit. &gt;&gt; So first God is going to deal with your heart. &gt;&gt; This this is when this is when you feel that pull. God start dealing with your heart and you start feeling that pull and and and you start to feel things you don't know where they came from, you know, and and and I can tell my testimony. I was out in the world and and all of a sudden this pull came upon me and and I decided I would go go and see &gt;&gt; and I heard about the message and and and I was witnessed to but I couldn't come until God started dealing with my heart. That's right. &gt;&gt; And he began to deal with my heart and I and I just and it dropped in my heart and I was like, you know what? I'm going to go Sunday morning. and I'm going to go check this church out. &gt;&gt; And I went and then I went on from there. He gave me a new spirit. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; But Bam say that new spirit he gives you &gt;&gt; because you can't even get along with the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He said without that new spirit, you can't even get along with the spirit of God. &gt;&gt; So God has to change your nature. &gt;&gt; He has to change the way you think. &gt;&gt; He has to change the way you look at things. So that's why he changes your your spirit and give you a new spirit &gt;&gt; so that you can agree with his spirit. &gt;&gt; So when the Holy Ghost try to lead and guide you, &gt;&gt; you won't fight against the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; You agree not the Holy Spirit because when you don't your natural spirit will not agree with the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, the Holy Ghost is a promise tonight. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And and and everything in the scripture, every scripture is a promise to me and you tonight. &gt;&gt; Healing is a promise to me. &gt;&gt; So, all I got to do is wait on it. &gt;&gt; Take him at his word and wait on it. &gt;&gt; Take him at his word and wait on it. &gt;&gt; God bless. &gt;&gt; Amen. In 2 Corinthians chapter 5:1 17, the Bible say, "Therefore, if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And old things are passed away and all things are become new. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. And let's go to the uh book of Samuel chapter 10 verse 6. Chapter 10 verse 6. When you find it, just say amen. And and and this is when the prophet Samuel would then begin to deal with King Saul. That's right. &gt;&gt; And and and when when they they asked for a king and God gave it to him. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; So God couldn't just send Saul in his condition the way he was. &gt;&gt; No, sir. &gt;&gt; So just to show you that God starts dealing with the heart. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; In in verse six, he says, "And the he was telling Saul what was going to happen." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. And he was telling you, saying, "And the spirit of the Lord will come upon thee, and thou shalt prophesy with them, and shall be turned into another man." &gt;&gt; That's exactly. &gt;&gt; So he was telling Saul, you going to receive a new spirit. &gt;&gt; That's exactly. &gt;&gt; In verse seven, he said, "And let it be when these signs are come unto thee, that thou do as occasion as occasion serve thee, for God is with thee." &gt;&gt; That's right. In verse eight, he said, "And thou shalt go down before me to Gilgal, and behold, I will come down unto thee to offer burnt offerings, and to sacrifice sacrifices of peace offerings, seven days shall thou tar till I come to thee, and show thee what thou shalt do." And verse 9 say, "And it was so that when he had turned his back to go from Samuel, &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; God gave him another heart." &gt;&gt; That's exactly right. &gt;&gt; And all those signs came to pass that day. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; See, he gave him he gave him another heart first. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Because the prophecy hadn't been fulfilled yet. &gt;&gt; He gave him another heart. &gt;&gt; And the message, why some people can't keep the victory. &gt;&gt; Why some people can't keep the victory. &gt;&gt; In 1957, &gt;&gt; Yes sir. Paragraph 50. He says, "Yes, that's what we need today is experiences of the new birth." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He said, "I want you to watch the order that Ezekiel brought it in." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; He said, "I will give you a new heart." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And I'll give you a new spirit. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And I'll put my spirit in you. &gt;&gt; He said, "I want you to watch. There's three of it." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; A new heart. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I'll take the old stony heart away. &gt;&gt; That's the old different heart you have. &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord. He's saying I'll give you a new spirit. &gt;&gt; Now many time and there's been a terrible mistake. &gt;&gt; The people has thought sometimes that the new spirit was the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; He said but it isn't. &gt;&gt; It's a new spirit. &gt;&gt; He said God gives you a new spirit. &gt;&gt; He said why you couldn't even get along with yourself &gt;&gt; with your old spirit. &gt;&gt; He said how you going to get along with the Holy Ghost? &gt;&gt; He said God had to give you a new spirit. so you could get along with his spirit. &gt;&gt; He said, "And sometimes people a new heart of flesh so you will receive it." &gt;&gt; He said, "Then a new spirit in that in their heart &gt;&gt; and then I'll put my spirit in that." &gt;&gt; You see, he said new heart, &gt;&gt; new spirit. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And my spirit, &gt;&gt; three things he spoke of. He said, "Now many times we try to make that thing just say, "Well, as soon as you get the new spirit, you quit your stealing." He said, "You'll quit your lying." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Things like that. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; You say, "Oh, hallelujah. I got it." &gt;&gt; He said, "You found out the first time anyone crosses your path a little bit, oh mercy, what a difference. &gt;&gt; Sure, you blow up like a frog eating buckshot." He said, "But let me tell you, brother, &gt;&gt; that's the reason you never got God's spirit." &gt;&gt; He said, "That's true." Oh, you say he stepped on my toe. I just I'll just not put up with that. &gt;&gt; All right. That shows what you got in you. &gt;&gt; He said, "That's true. I put a new spirit in you &gt;&gt; and then I put my spirit in you." &gt;&gt; He said, "Now, the heart is in the center of the emotions, sir, &gt;&gt; of the human being." &gt;&gt; He said, "Your heart is the middle of you." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's exactly right. He said, "So God puts a new heart in the middle of the old man. &gt;&gt; Then he puts a new spirit in the middle of the new spirit." &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And then he puts his spirit in the middle of that new spirit. &gt;&gt; He said, "Now it's all just exactly like the main screen in a famous watch." &gt;&gt; Now, Brother Ber going to use a watch to to show to show you how this how this connect. &gt;&gt; He said he said it's just exactly like the main screen in a famous watch. He said they got a little click over here working, a little click over here working. He said it's little wheels are turning. He said but it's all controlled by the main screen &gt;&gt; that you could have. He said the trouble of it today we left off the main screen brother. He said we try to make ourselves Methodist, Baptist, Presbyterian and build great churches. Say look here what a fine watch I got. He said look at what a fine stem is got on it. Look at the face out of it. He said it's got rubies in it. It got jewels in it. He said it isn't it isn't worth a dime if it don't keep time. &gt;&gt; He said it isn't worth a dime if it don't keep time. &gt;&gt; He said that what's the matter today? He said we try to make that Methodist and the Baptist trying to make the Baptist and the Presbyterians and the Pentecostals and we try to get the prettiest church, the best pastor and the smartest man and everything. And our church just don't keep time with God's Bible. &gt;&gt; He said, "That's what's the matter." See, &gt;&gt; you left off his spirit. &gt;&gt; He said, "Hasn't Jesus said, have you heard that the stone that the builders rejected has become the chief of the corner?" That's right. &gt;&gt; Certainly the main screen. &gt;&gt; He say now when the main screen is in the watch, &gt;&gt; not a self- winding, it's a God winding watch. He said the only thing you do to a self- winding watch, the only way you do is your emotions with the watch is what it is what winds it your emotions. He said your emotions towards the word of God is what winds you up with the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; He said if you're taking God's word, there it is that new watch. He said now you know Ezekiel saw it again &gt;&gt; and he this same prophet he saw it as a wheel in the middle of a wheel. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Turning up in the air. Now the will he say first there is a &gt;&gt; real sir &gt;&gt; I can get &gt;&gt; you say first there there's a will &gt;&gt; sir &gt;&gt; he said first there's a rim the he said the tire then the rim &gt;&gt; then the spokes &gt;&gt; and then the hub. &gt;&gt; That's it. He said, "Now when Luther started, &gt;&gt; they just they just shall live by faith, &gt;&gt; justification." &gt;&gt; Say he bought the tire around it. &gt;&gt; He bought the tire around it. &gt;&gt; So this going, we're going to make it live. The tire, &gt;&gt; they all play their part. He said he put the tire on it. He said yes. All right. He said wasn't much of a will yet. &gt;&gt; He said all right there. Here come along the Methodist with sanctification. &gt;&gt; Put the tire on it and then in the rim around it. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; So we you see the rim and the tire. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; He say and then along come Pentecost &gt;&gt; and they taught sanctification. He said the Luther or the Methodist. The Luther taught justification which was a tie on the outside. &gt;&gt; That's right. He said the rim then was the Methodist with with sanctification &gt;&gt; and the Pentecostals come along and they put a spoke in it &gt;&gt; speaking in tongues. &gt;&gt; Now he didn't he didn't say they put all the spokes in it. He said they put a spoke in it. &gt;&gt; They put one spoke in it. &gt;&gt; So evidence speaking in tongues was all they needed to see. So basically what he was saying, long they spoke in tongues, they believe they had it. &gt;&gt; That's not enough. &gt;&gt; He said, he said, "Well, let me tell you, brother, &gt;&gt; it don't consist just of that. &gt;&gt; That's the reason we're we're lumping, bumping down the road the way we are." &gt;&gt; He said, "There's not one spoken there, but there's nine spiritual gifts in the church, not just one." He said, he say all them's all right. The tire all right. The rim is all right. The spokes all right. But he said but like the colored man eating the watermelon. He said there's more of it. &gt;&gt; He said that's what I mean today. There's more of it. There's nine spiritual spokes in this wheel and it's turned by the wheel in the middle of a wheel &gt;&gt; all connected with the hub. &gt;&gt; Yes, my brother. And I wonder I I used to ponder I said what do Ezekiel mean when he say he saw him as a wheel in the middle of a wheel. &gt;&gt; So what Ezekiel was saying is here &gt;&gt; Christ is that hub &gt;&gt; and it ain't just speaking in tongues but all nine spiritual gifts. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Connects that hub to the rim. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; To the tire &gt;&gt; and Christ is in the middle and he controls all the spiritual gifts. That's accept. &gt;&gt; So that's why they can impersonate the gifts. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; They can impersonate the speaking in tongues. They can impersonate prophesying. They can do all these things. But they don't have Christ the hub in the middle. &gt;&gt; And that will separate us from them because we got to live life &gt;&gt; and not just a spiritual gift, but we have a life that we can live. We have something that can stop us when we get ready to do wrong. We got something that can control our eyes when we looking at the wrong things. We got something that can make us repent when we do wrong. That's the piece that they're missing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "Yes, brother. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; The good thing, no matter what we're doing, &gt;&gt; how you're doing it, &gt;&gt; you're fighting the air because God done said, "I will restore, say the Lord." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; It's got to come. He said, "Now, the hub is where it all turns from." in the main screen where all the watch works from. He said the main screen it ticks he said ticks it right up keeps every blessing just exactly where it's supposed to be. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said now these gifts your gifts of tongues wonderful. He said just justification by faith wonderful. Sanctification fine speaking in tongues wonderful interpretation fine. Messages from God wonderful. He says prophecy fine. He said, "Brother, if it hasn't got no hub in it," &gt;&gt; he said, "What's it going to amount to?" He said, "Your spokes will get all crossed up with one another. &gt;&gt; They'll cross up, fuss, fight, isolate, and ch and tear up on each other." He said, "That's what's the matter. We need the main screen. &gt;&gt; What God does is do to have the little bitty springs and the little bitty gadgets in here and the winding springs and the alarms and the faces and the big hands and all these things." He's saying there isn't something in there to make it operate. &gt;&gt; He said if there isn't something in there to make it operate, what good is to have it? &gt;&gt; What good is to have the spiritual gifts? What what's good to be able to do all those things and you don't have the you don't have the hub? &gt;&gt; You don't have the Holy Spirit on the inside that tells you how to use these things, how to control these things. He said, "I believe the Pentecostal church has got the baptism of the Holy Ghost." He said, "I believe the rest of you do too that claim it." He said, "I believe you speaking in tongues is right." He said, "I believe that your prophecy is right." He said, "I'll go with you." He said, "I'll go with you on being a Baptist." I believe it. He He's saying he agree with that. Sure, I do. He said, "But here's one thing, brother." He said, "It's not it's not keeping the right kind of time." That's what I'm trying to say. So it take the baptism of the Holy Ghost to come into that human heart there to make the thing run right. &gt;&gt; He said the love of God, God is love. And unless each one of these gift is put right in the center of love, &gt;&gt; it becomes selfish and indifferent. That's right. &gt;&gt; And pull itself off and isolate itself and cross over and fuss and stew. He said, but when it's anchored right into the middle of love, &gt;&gt; it'll fellowship anywhere. &gt;&gt; It'll fellowship everywhere. And that's right. That's exactly what we need. The church is dying for love, brother. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, Ezekiel says this, and brother Brenham put this in the personation of Christianity. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; In paragraph 45, he says, he says, "Now the new heart does not mean work up the old one." &gt;&gt; He said, he said, "Doesn't mean that the church need a facelifting." He said it mean that the church needs a birth. &gt;&gt; He said God's church don't need a polishing. It needs a conversion. &gt;&gt; He said that's right. That's just to take the old church and and set say well I tell you we'll change the deacon board. We'll swap the pastor. He say that isn't what the church needs. It leads to baptism of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; It leads to power of the living God. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; He said a revival doesn't mean to go out and get new members. He said a revival means to revive that what you already got. &gt;&gt; So denomination think revivals is to go out and pull in members. But the true meaning of revive is to take what you already have &gt;&gt; and revive it. &gt;&gt; Take that spirit you already have and revive it. &gt;&gt; Take that Holy Ghost you already got and refill it. &gt;&gt; We're not looking for something new. We're going to take what you already got and revive it. Amen. &gt;&gt; In paragraph 194, impersonation of Christianity. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; And he says in and father we are tired of impersonation of Christian life. &gt;&gt; He said create in us Lord today a new heart. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; A new spirit. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. and put your spirit according to your prophet's word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In the middle of our new spirit. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And control us by love. Yes, &gt;&gt; joy, peace, sir. &gt;&gt; Longsuffering, goodness, gentleness, patience, &gt;&gt; and faith, and all the fruits of the spirit may be found in us. Amen. &gt;&gt; As we humbly yield ourselves, our souls, the innermost part, the life that brings all this earthly calcium and petroleum together and holds it dust, when it leaves, we go back to the dust. He said, "And we yield our spirit." He said, "We yield them to you &gt;&gt; and create in us the right kind of spirit and let the Holy Spirit, the spirit control us and lead us and guide us as we journey on." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. In the message, God keeps his word in 1957 paragraph 212. He says, "Now, won't you sweetly, father, move on into their heart." He said, "Put your spirit in their new spirit." He said, "You had to give them a new spirit." I want you to catch this. He said, "You had to give them a new spirit or they would never held their hand." So, it it even takes that new spirit for you to be able to just lift your hands. That's how important that new spirit is. &gt;&gt; It takes a new spirit for you to just lift your hands. &gt;&gt; Now you see how important it is for that new spirit to help you agree &gt;&gt; with the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; He said he said you had to give them a new spirit or they would never held their hand. &gt;&gt; He said they wouldn't have desired it. So the new spirit that new spirit brings the desire. He said, "But they went down to the potter's house and they let you change their emotions and their ideas, &gt;&gt; and now in their heart they're being tender." He said, "And you said, no man can come to me except my father draws him." They could not have raised their hands from the youngest to the oldest unless you had told them to do it. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He said, "They did it because you spoke to them." That's right. &gt;&gt; And it's God giving them to Christ as a love gift. &gt;&gt; They have yielded their heart. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So they have yielded their heart and had a had a heart change. God have changed your heart. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Then that new spirit begin to work on you. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; And then you become you become the church and then you be come to search for something that there's nothing left but the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; And you begin to search for something and you know something missing &gt;&gt; and and you and you can't figure it out. You're like I know it's something else. It's more to this. I I I spoke in tongues and I I can feel the pull and I can feel the urge when I'm inside the sanctuary. But it's more to this. It's like I need something that can control my life. &gt;&gt; I need something that can help me love my neighbor. I need something that can help me love every brother and sister here on the same wave. And that's what the Holy Spirit does. It do things that you can't do yourself. &gt;&gt; It makes you live a life that you can't live yourself. You can't impersonate the Holy Spirit. He says in paragraph 214, he said, "And we can hear your great voice say, he that hearth my word, &gt;&gt; sir, &gt;&gt; not your church, your church has your word, and it isn't contrary to your word." He said, "But he that hearth my word and believeth on him that sent me have everlasting life &gt;&gt; and shall not come into judgment, but has passed from death unto life." &gt;&gt; Amen. And the message said, "What does it take to make a Christian life?" Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; He says in paragraph 35, "The Holy Spirit will make every movement like Christ." &gt;&gt; Not one movement. The Holy Ghost will make every movement like Christ. &gt;&gt; Listen at this. It'll make you &gt;&gt; Christlike. &gt;&gt; It ain't It ain't going to ask you, "Do you want to be Christlike?" It will make you &gt;&gt; Christlike. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said all the fruits of the spirit. He said those things are what the Holy Spirit controls our emotions. He said our emotion emotions is not so much as jumping up and down. You could do that. &gt;&gt; He said he said a sheen did will bring that to you. He said, "But the Holy Spirit brings you into operation &gt;&gt; or in control of God. That you walk in peace, &gt;&gt; that you walk in love, &gt;&gt; and joy with long suffering &gt;&gt; and and all the spiritual gifts." You see, it isn't something that you do. It's something the Holy Spirit does in you. &gt;&gt; See, you you see, it's no longer an intellectual thought of your own. It's a subconscious movement of the Holy Spirit. Oh, I wish I could shout the praises of God around the world to that. &gt;&gt; He says, "Church of the living God, that's where our Pentecostal move fail." He said, "We have some man-made musical clap hands, jump up and down emotion." He said, "When if we go back out on the street and the Holy Spirit doesn't govern our lives to cooperate with that, we have not got the Holy Spirit." &gt;&gt; That's not ski milk. He says, he said, "But brother, that's what the church needs. &gt;&gt; Only life can come by the Holy Spirit." &gt;&gt; So he's saying, "Don't be amazed that you can do these things." He said, "But when you walk out and you don't see yourself manifesting or lining up with this word," he said, then you need to take inventory. You need to check yourself. And there's nothing wrong with if you coming up short with something, you just got to recognize it and then you got to call out. You got to cry out for whatever it is you need. There's nothing wrong with crying out if you re first you got to recognize you need help &gt;&gt; first you got to recognize you need help &gt;&gt; so you can't you can't see that you need help and sit there and think that God is just going to come along and find you and just give you what you want God say you got to cry out you got to cry out for the things that you need to cry out for healing you you You are healed by his stripes. But God want you to cry out for &gt;&gt; it. &gt;&gt; In the book of Psalms. Turn to the book of Psalms, chapter 51, &gt;&gt; verse 10. &gt;&gt; Verse 10. &gt;&gt; You got it. Say amen. Verse 10 says, "Create in me &gt;&gt; a clean heart, oh God, and renew a right spirit within me. Cast me not away from thy presence, &gt;&gt; and take not thy holy spirit from me." &gt;&gt; He says, "Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation &gt;&gt; and uphold me with thy free spirit." &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; So he these are requests. He said, "Then will," He said, "Then will I teach transgressors thy ways, and sinners shall be converted to thee." &gt;&gt; So, what what what he's saying is, I want you to work on me &gt;&gt; first. &gt;&gt; This is this is his petition. I want you to clean me up first. &gt;&gt; So, what he's saying right there, I can't help nobody, &gt;&gt; God, until you fix me. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That's what he's saying right there. He said, he said, "If you clean me up, &gt;&gt; if if you give me a clean heart, oh God, and if you renew the rot spirit within me, &gt;&gt; and you cast not away from thy cast me not away from thy presence, &gt;&gt; and take not the Holy Spirit from me," &gt;&gt; and he's saying, "And if you restore unto me that joy &gt;&gt; of the salvation salvation." So, he realized that he lost that joy. &gt;&gt; And not only did he realize that he lost it, but he realized that he had to have it. that he couldn't help nobody else with it. If he didn't have joy, how you going to help somebody else? &gt;&gt; How I'm going to preach to you joy and if I don't have joy? &gt;&gt; How I'm going to preach to you healing if I don't believe in healing? &gt;&gt; And that's that is what he's saying. I got to believe this. I got to have this before I can bring it to you. &gt;&gt; He said, when you give me these things, he said, then I will teach transgressors thy ways. &gt;&gt; And then he says, and and what's going to come out of this? Sinners shall be converted unto thee. &gt;&gt; Sinners shall be converted &gt;&gt; unto thee. &gt;&gt; So he he's tell he's telling you that once you fix me, then you're going to be pleased with the results. &gt;&gt; He say, "Now I can go out and do your work. &gt;&gt; I can go I can go out and witness for you. &gt;&gt; Now you can give me the right words to say because all things are lining up." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. But he recognized that he didn't have what he needed. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And that's what we got to do tonight. We got to recognize &gt;&gt; where we at tonight. &gt;&gt; In the in the book of Isaiah chapter 6 verse 5, &gt;&gt; Isaiah says this in chapter um 6 verse 5. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; He says then said I wo &gt;&gt; is me. &gt;&gt; He say for I am undone. &gt;&gt; I am. He said, "Because I am a man of unclean lips." &gt;&gt; He said, "And I dwell in the midst of a people of unclean lips." &gt;&gt; He said, "For my eyes have seen the king, the Lord of hosts." &gt;&gt; So Isaiah begin to cry out. &gt;&gt; He begin He begins to speak out and say, "I am a man of unclean lips." &gt;&gt; And not only am I unclean, Isaiah testifying that. And I'm looking around and everything around me is unclean, Lord. &gt;&gt; He said, "But I need you to clean me up." Amen. &gt;&gt; So this first you got to cry out then the cry the cry come first and in the message things that are to be in 1965 in paragraph 77 brother Brandon says now think if God in his mercy has the mother before the little baby is born is craving for some vitamin and the mother word speaks for a dad I want cantaloupe or watermelon he say I want something or mother. He says he'll do everything he can to get that. &gt;&gt; He said because he knows that he wants his child born as perfect as he can be. &gt;&gt; You see, he said and he'll do everything that he's able to do to get it. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; He says how much more able he is to get it. He's a creator. &gt;&gt; Now, think how able he is to prepare us a body. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; To live like his own glorious body. If we want to live, there is something in us calls us to live. &gt;&gt; And there is something in us that calls us to do right. &gt;&gt; Then God will cause somebody on the platform or the pull pit that will preach the absolute truth. &gt;&gt; He say, "Why?" See, it shows you then if you a real child of God, you begin to cry out, &gt;&gt; "God, take it away from me. &gt;&gt; Circumcise me from this. Take these things away from me." Why? It's needed for your heavenly home that you're going to. He's saying where he's going to prepare, you got to be a real word bride of Christ. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And see, when you got that Holy Spirit in you, you begin to take inventory &gt;&gt; and you begin to look over your life and you begin to see where you coming up short. &gt;&gt; And when the minister begin to preach and minister to your heart and when God speaks to you, &gt;&gt; then you the Holy Ghost in you will speak back to the word. And when you see that, you are missing these things that I that I'm coming up short. It could be something simple as I not I don't study the word enough. I don't read my Bible enough. It could be something just as simple as that. But when it's spoken to you, you're supposed to cry out. Say, "Lord, that's me. &gt;&gt; That's me tonight. Wherever you falling short, you got to cry out." And God loves for you to cry out. But it takes that Holy Spirit to cry out. &gt;&gt; That's the difference. &gt;&gt; And the choosing of a bride in 1965. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Paragraph 240, he said, "Oh, Pentecost, run for your life." &gt;&gt; He said, "Flee to the horns of the altar and cry out." &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Before it's too late. He said, "For an hour will come when you can where you can cry and it'll do no good." That's right. &gt;&gt; He said, "For Esau sought to find a place &gt;&gt; of his birthight and couldn't find it. &gt;&gt; I could," he said, "I commit you, oh California, oh convention of the full gospel businessman who I he said whom I love, whom I left and scrum to." He said, "With all my heart," he said, "I commit you to Jesus Christ tonight. Flee to him. Don't let the devil ever cool you off from this." He said, "Stay right with it until you everyone is filled with the Holy Ghost." in so much that will make you come to this word that will make you women straighten up and that will make you men straighten up. &gt;&gt; If you say you got the Holy Ghost and won't cope with the word, it's another spirit in you. &gt;&gt; He said if you if you got the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; and it won't cope with the word, &gt;&gt; he said it's another spirit in you. Amen. &gt;&gt; He said God's spirit is God's spirit is on his word. &gt;&gt; So how can you have the Holy Spirit and then deny one word &gt;&gt; and deny one word of his bride must be a messiah the anointed word &gt;&gt; in the message a trial &gt;&gt; in 1964. Paragraph 114, he said, "One of these days, &gt;&gt; men and women will cry out." &gt;&gt; He said, "It'll be too far, but too late." &gt;&gt; He said, "The door will be closed." &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "It will be that way." &gt;&gt; He said, "The virgins come and knocked on the door." &gt;&gt; And said, "Let us in." &gt;&gt; He said they wanted to get some of the oil. &gt;&gt; He said, "But they ought to have got oil when oil was being given out." &gt;&gt; He said they knocked on the door. It said, he said, "They will cast into outer darkness where there'll be weeping and whailing and nashing of teeth." He said, "I'm only trying to make that little sideline of the defense to the court now." Oh, the word. He He said, "You got to get the Holy Spirit. You got to get this Holy Spirit now while you got a chance." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; In the message, Birth Pays. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. In 1965, &gt;&gt; he says in paragraph 71, he says, "And that's the way that we get what we want &gt;&gt; is cry for it." &gt;&gt; He said, "Don't be ashamed." &gt;&gt; Don't be ashamed tonight. &gt;&gt; He say, "I'm hungering for God. Don't care whether the deacons, &gt;&gt; pastors, &gt;&gt; or whatever is around &gt;&gt; say you scream out &gt;&gt; anyhow. &gt;&gt; He said the Jones are sitting there. He say what difference does it make? &gt;&gt; He said cry out. &gt;&gt; He said that's the only way that there is to get it. &gt;&gt; He said until you get help. &gt;&gt; He taught that when he was here on earth, you know about the unjust judge. &gt;&gt; Yes, my brother. So God, he telling you that how to get it. He said the only way you going to get it, you going to have to cry out for it. &gt;&gt; You're going to have to cry out for it. And you going to have to forget about who's around you. &gt;&gt; You going to have to forget about your family. &gt;&gt; You're going to forget about your friends. &gt;&gt; And you going to have to just get yourself behind the veil and just drop everything around you. And you going to have to cry out to God. &gt;&gt; Say, "Lord, I see why I'm coming up short. Lord, I see why I'm failing you in your word, Lord. Lord, I see why I'm not lining up with your word. And you just got to block everything, God, and say, "Lord, I need something to keep me. &gt;&gt; Lord, I need something to keep me. &gt;&gt; Lord, I need something to scrape me out. I need you to take away these things that I can't get rid of." &gt;&gt; And see, and see, you would try over and over again to get rid of these things, &gt;&gt; but you're not able. sir, &gt;&gt; you're not able &gt;&gt; and you and you and you may be free from it from that debt for that day, but it's coming back because you don't have what it take to control it. The Holy Spirit will forever guide you and lead you. &gt;&gt; In the message, Who is Jesus? 1964 paragraph 112. &gt;&gt; He said if they hold their peace, &gt;&gt; the rocks will cry out immediately. &gt;&gt; He say something is going to cry out &gt;&gt; when he is around. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He say something is going to cry out whenever he's around. &gt;&gt; So wherever the president of God is, &gt;&gt; something is going to cry out. &gt;&gt; And God say if it don't cry out, he'll make the rocks cry out. He's going to get his praise. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Accepting God's provided way at the end time. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; 1963, paragraph 191. &gt;&gt; He said, "Well, that's the way we're supposed to do." &gt;&gt; He said, "If I see a promise in the Bible, &gt;&gt; that's it. That's God's word. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; He said, "Then I just stay there." &gt;&gt; He said, "And I cry out &gt;&gt; to God give it to me." &gt;&gt; I cry out until God give it to me. &gt;&gt; He said, "And he do that. &gt;&gt; Get you off his hands." You see, &gt;&gt; that will be in the natural, but wanting you to do it. &gt;&gt; He likes for you to ask. &gt;&gt; Ask abundantly &gt;&gt; that your joys might be full. He say cry until his word is vindicated. &gt;&gt; God say he want you to cry out until you see that word living in you. &gt;&gt; Don't you stop crying out until you can see that you can live this word. Don't you start crying out till you can walk right. Don't you start crying out till you can talk right. Don't you start crying out until you can love right. Don't you start crying out until you can live right. You cry out until you can do these things. &gt;&gt; Don't give up tonight. You keep crying. &gt;&gt; You keep asking God. &gt;&gt; You keep pulling on God. You keep lifting your hands. &gt;&gt; You keep yelling, "Hallelujah. You keep telling him, Lord, I need you, Lord. You keep calling on his name tonight." And you stay right there. &gt;&gt; You stay right there. &gt;&gt; Stay right there until he come. &gt;&gt; Amen. He say cry out until the word is vindicated. &gt;&gt; So he telling you don't you be satisfied. &gt;&gt; Don't be satisfied until &gt;&gt; you can see the word the full word &gt;&gt; come in manifestation in full view. Not in my life but in your life. in your life &gt;&gt; say the trouble of it is &gt;&gt; he say he said we get a cookie and think that's all there is. He said he said there's a whole table full. &gt;&gt; He said he said we got so we can speak in tongues. We say oh brother that's it. &gt;&gt; Oh no. He said, "That ain't." He said, "That just some of it." &gt;&gt; He said, "That's right." He said, "Oh, I got a happy enough to shout." He said, "That's some more of it." He said, "But there's a whole lot more of it." He said, "Just keep on crying out until Amen." &gt;&gt; God said, "There's so there's so much more to it. &gt;&gt; So much more to it." Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So much more to it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I and I didn't know why God gave me this message, but I challenge you tonight. &gt;&gt; I challenge you tonight. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Each one of each one of you know yourselves better. &gt;&gt; Better than anybody in here. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. And &gt;&gt; I'm speaking to you from the depths of my hearts tonight. The Holy Ghost is here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's here. &gt;&gt; It's here. &gt;&gt; It's a promise. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And and and it's here. &gt;&gt; And and and and God has promised that it can be given to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Even to your children. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And your children's children. &gt;&gt; And we don't have to sit here in the message of the hour &gt;&gt; and be short of anything. We don't have to sit here in the message of the hour &gt;&gt; and come up short with anything in our lives. &gt;&gt; He didn't say we we wouldn't fall short. &gt;&gt; He didn't say we wouldn't come up short. &gt;&gt; But we in a position &gt;&gt; and we have the Holy Spirit that we can recognize and all we got to do is cry out. &gt;&gt; All we got to do is is is is admit &gt;&gt; that I have a problem. &gt;&gt; It's just that simple. All we have to do is admit that I have a problem. &gt;&gt; And when we admit that we have that problem, &gt;&gt; whatever it is, &gt;&gt; God is obligated. &gt;&gt; He's obligated. &gt;&gt; He's obligated to come meet your needs. &gt;&gt; He said, "Confess." &gt;&gt; And once you confess, he's obligated. &gt;&gt; It's on him. And if he don't, he's guilty. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's guilty. I don't know who I don't know. I'm pretty sure we have a lot of believers in here tonight that that possess the Holy Spirit. And I I I know this, but if if if it's one in here tonight, I I don't I don't know who it is. If it if it's just one, maybe an invisible artist, if there are one that's been seeking the Holy Spirit, It's here. &gt;&gt; It's here. &gt;&gt; My message to you tonight is you don't have to you don't have to be in that same condition. You don't have to be that way. There there's something here that can pull the things of the world straight out of you. You don't have to battle with the things of the world. We have something here stronger than the things of the world. &gt;&gt; We have we have something more powerful than the things of the world. &gt;&gt; And and and you don't have to keep these things. But I I just pray, oh God, that whoever this for tonight that that you have pricked their heart, that you have pricricked their heart and and and bought a change on this night and and and and the new spirit is beginning to come in &gt;&gt; and and then there'll be testimonies that that you have put your spirit in &gt;&gt; and they can testify and see, you know, I used to do this, but I I don't do this no more. &gt;&gt; I used to go here, but I don't go there no more. I used to look at this, but I don't look at that no more. and and and that testimony will come forth that I have somebody in me that is greater than me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And and you can you can be a a walking testimony. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just like he he cleaned Israel up. He did it in the midst of the heathen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; God can clean you up in the midst of this darkness in this world. &gt;&gt; And when when you go out, you don't have to feel you don't have to feel guilty by saying, "I'm a Christian." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Oh, I believe in the message of the hour because when you say that, your life will line up with it. &gt;&gt; And that's what we want tonight. &gt;&gt; We want to won't vindicate the word fully. &gt;&gt; I pray that this been a blessing to you tonight. Y'all put your hands together for the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Praise God. Praise God. Praise God. Amen. God when he send his word the word will never return void to God until he have fulfilled that which he was sent for. The biggest mistake we can do right now is worry about our tomorrow, worry about our job, worry about our schooling and worry to rush And at the end, everything you're going to be working with for will be burned except the Holy Spirit. Amen. The biggest mistake you would do is to live tonight without taking any opportunity to pray. I know we have a tendency for me to pray for the congregation. I'm a pastor. I will pray for you. But before I pray, you need to cry out. Number one, you need to admit. Admit where you are. Once you admit, automatically, that's a humility right there. Because as long as you think you right, there is no way God will help you. Forget about where you are. If we are already perfect, the rapture would have taken place &gt;&gt; and we will be completely out of here. If you reach perfection and the rapture and coming back yet, then you need to go to the grave because God won't want to you lose you. He will pick you up and put you there. So if you still alive, it means there are still things in our life. Let me leave you. There are still things in my life that I need to work on it that the Holy Spirit need to work on it. You know how you struggle with the message of the hour? God knows you better than me. God saw you where you are. God saw the things that you did that no one knows. Only you and God. God sees where you struggling in the darkness where you can block the pastor. You can block the deacon. You can block people until no one have access to what you're doing except the Holy Spirit who sees everything. And the Holy Spirit who saw all these type of things have come tonight to help you and to tell you that I'm ready right now to clean you up. And I cannot send a message without confirming my word. He's here to vindicate his promise and he's here and he's guilty of his promise. There is two choices before you leave this church. One of you will be guilty. Either it's going to be God who's going to be guilty or you will be guilty. And the only way you will be guilty is when you leave the church without asking because he gave you the opportunity and spoke to you to ask. But the only way you can leave this church clean without any problem and even you on a invisible audience, the only way you can live without any problem and have your heart clean is to make sure you take the burden. In other words, send the ball back to God. Tell God, you send your word. You spoke to me tonight. I see where I'm struggling. I see where I have difficulty understanding what the pastor preach here or there. Or I see where I don't agree with the message. I still wrestle with certain things. Even those online, I'm still reasoning with certain things. I see where the problem is. And here you came to my rescue to help me. So now I'm going to act according to your word. Number one, I'm going to admit where I'm wrong. And number two, I'm going to ask you to help me because if you don't help me, there is no way I can be changed because I tried all these years in the message and I'm not able to change. But I want you to help me tonight so that you yourself will come and put you a new heart. If that's what you needed, put a new spirit if that's what is needed and put your Holy Spirit in me. If you already have the Holy Spirit, ask him to refill you again with the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit to touch your body, to touch your soul, to touch your your spirit. Even you children, do not sit and walk and then look at people around. You cry up to the Lord yourself. You say, "God, I want to leave this church right here filled with the Holy Spirit and be different." Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Remember, he say, "Seek ye first the kingdom of God." If you notice the scripture the brother read in Ezekiel, after you receive the new heart, then the new spirit, then the Holy Spirit. If you watch what follow, God begin to increase the corn and God begin to increase remove the famine because those material blessing will follow automatically because the first one has been rich. I'm going to help you up with a scripture in case you don't know how to pray. I'm going to give you a scripture and use this scripture because God is guilty of his word. So if you don't know what to tell God, use this scripture tonight. It is not my word. It is not your word. It is the word of God. It's in the book of Luke chapter 11. You don't have to turn there. If you want to turn, that's fine. Luke chapter 11 verse 9. The Bible says, this is the word of Jesus Christ. He say, "And I say unto you, ask." This is what the brother was saying. Cry out. In other words, ask. I say unto you, ask and it shall be given unto you. In other words, you are you have a guarantee when you ask tonight. God must give it to you. I'm putting that master because I know an elect must receive the Holy Ghost. He says ask and it shall be given to you. He says seek and ye shall find. I know you you know this but just pay attention. Knock and it shall be open to you. If you don't know how to ask, seek. If you don't know how to seek, knock tonight. Tell God as a child, you say, "I'm knocking right now at your door." Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. Do you hear me? I'm knocking. Talk to God like that. Don't Don't Don't try to be like, "I'm knocking spiritual." No. Tell him I'm knocking. I'm knocking right now. Amen. Verse 10. For everyone that ask receiveth. Everybody understand tonight? Everyone that ask will do what? &gt;&gt; So if you don't ask tonight, that's your problem. Amen. &gt;&gt; Ah, everyone that ask receive him. And he that seeketh doeth what? Findeth, and to him that knock, he shall be how? And if a son shall ask bread of any of you that is a father, we got fathers here. Will he give him a stone? Or if he ask a fish, will he uh will he for a fish give him a serpent? Or if he shall ask an egg, will he offer will he offer him a scorpion? And this is your scripture tonight. If ye then being evil, know how to give good gifts plural unto your children, how much more shall your heavenly father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him? It's written right here. So God will give you the Holy Ghost if you ask him the Holy Ghost that will make this message easy for you. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost that will not wrestle with any quotes of brother Brham. The Holy Ghost that will not you won't need anybody to come on you to tell you leave this place. Somebody will tell you this is not the right place for you. You won't need the deacon to be on you every time to tell you how to dress or you dress wrong. You don't need any reminder about the dressing anymore because it's the Holy Spirit. You won't need your parent to be there all the time with you because the Holy Ghost will tell you it's time to go home. The Holy Ghost will tell you this is not the right friend. Even if they are friending a message, the Holy Ghost will tell you this is not a good message friend. This is somebody you need to separate from them because most of our trouble are coming from our friendship because they are supposedingly to be in the message but they're not in the message. So now let's start. It's a season to be blessed and God want to bless you spiritually, physically, materially, financially and everything. Let's start by the Holy Spirit. So you play softly. If you in a rush, you can the door are open. You can leave. Don't put a rush on us. Remember, don't mind the deacon, don't mind the pastor, don't mind whoever is around all the journes. Mind your own business and ask the Lord tonight. Mommy prayed for you so much. Daddy pray for you so much. Tonight it's not about mommy or daddy. You yourself open your mouth please and talk to the Lord. Let mommy pray for himself, for herself. Let daddy do his own praying. You pray for yourself and talk to your maker. Approach him as your creator, as your father, and tell him when he send his word, the word never return void. It will always fulfill. Let that the word, this rain come down tonight and find the appropriate ground where it will bring a transformation. God does things unusual. He chose this Wednesday. If you know why this brother is preaching here, he was not even supposed to be preaching today. It was another minister who was supposed to preach today and an inconvenience happened and he's now preaching today. A message he didn't prepare. It's a fresh one coming from the throne of God. Pray in the name of Jesus Christ and ask him. Heavenly Father, Lord, we are approaching you humbly tonight. Father, thanking you so much for your grace, for your love, and for your mercy, Lord, and for intervening tonight in a special way when we were turning the corner. Father, as a pastor, I know exactly why I'm saying turning the corner. And there was something standing in the corner. And Lord, Father, you heard my prayer. And you open up a door again after many doors that you open up. You open up another window tonight to make sure whoever was lagging behind. Whoever was left and was not progressing and moving with the move of the Holy Spirit as you are unfolding the word, you want to pick them up tonight, Lord, and to make sure they are in this exodus so that Lord, Father, not even a hoof will stay behind, Lord. Father, whoever is struggling from this audience or the invisible audience, wherever they are, whichever state, Father, things that we know better not to do, but we found oursel caught up into them, things that we know and been preached for. And Father, here we still struggling after many years. Father, anything connected to the temple, anything that we see not aligned by the word, Lord Jesus Christ, we coming tonight and me as a pastor, oh Father, crying out for myself, crying out for my family, crying out for the church, crying out for your children, Lord, Father, admitting where we are wrong and asking you because you sent your word and your word will never return void. Father, now that we have opened up and you heard our prayer yesterday in a Zoom prayer and you came down to visit us according to the prayer, Lord Jesus Christ, I pray right now for everyone that have obey your word and open up their mouth. Your word stated, Lord, Father, that you also give the Holy Ghost to them that obey you, Lord, as they are crying up, you the great fountain, you the great ocean. May you open up the windows of heaven. May your presence come down. May the windows of heaven come. May father, Lord Jesus Christ, the Holy Spirit come down and fill each one of us here. Father, you did it on the day of Pentecost. Not one person left that building without receiving the Holy Spirit. Father, whoever don't have the Holy Spirit tonight, our children, our young people, our old one, Father, fill them with the Holy Spirit in the name of Jesus Christ. And if somebody have it, Lord, we fill him with the spirit of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Lord, fill our body, our soul, our spirit, every fiber of our being. Father, change, remove the old stone, remove the old spirit, remove the old nature. May the fire of the Holy Spirit burn and remove any root that is not the root and the offspring of David. Lord, may predestinated seed be quickened tonight because you say ask &gt;&gt; and we are asking in the name that is above every name, the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Because this is your promise and the promise was to us. The promise was for our children. The promise was for as many as you will call again Lord. And father we are praying tonight Lord. May nobody left leave this building &gt;&gt; the same way they came in here. Father, this is your mercy that have been extended again in the midst of a series to Lord Father bring another opportunity to feel and bless somebody before the closing of 2025 so that it will be a testimony that that night the Holy Spirit came and changed my life. That night, that night the spirit of the Lord fill my heart. I felt my body, my spirit, my entire being completely changed. Lord, you told us in your word to seek ye first the kingdom of God. Father, this is what we seeking tonight. And Father, we are coming according to your word and the opening of the word tonight. May you strengthen your man's servant tonight. Father, the one that you use, Lord. Father, remember him and his family as well, Lord. Father, we pray for those that didn't have opportunity to be in this building tonight. Father, may the spirit of the Lord touch them where they are and may whatever reason block them. May it never happen again unless it's legitimate. May Lord, Father, you burn every desire of the world. May you burn everything that is contrary to your word, to the message of the hour. Lord, may you come down in the power of resurrection and fill. Let our cup be overflown tonight, Lord. Father, we praying. I'm standing as a pastor, as a shepherd for the congregation, visible and invisible. And Lord, Father, they are also praying. And you spoke in your word where two or three are gathered in your name. Father, you will be in the midst of them. You were already here present Lord. But Lord, Father, we pray as door are opening up Lord. Father, inviting you to come and sine and abide and stay and feel and and and and and Lord affect our bodies, affect our mind, our spirit, our soul, our children. Lord, touch every part of the body that is sick. Lord, tonight may the power of the Holy Spirit &gt;&gt; fill Lord tonight, Lord. Those that don't know how to pray, Lord Jesus Christ, I'm standing as a pastor, standing Lord, Father, and Lord Father, putting my shoulder to their prayer and pushing the name of Jesus Christ so that you be merciful to them. You forgive them for every iniquity, any sin, any trespasses, just being obedient to speak to you. Father, look at their heart, Lord, and give them exceedingly and abundantly above everything that they can ask and need, Lord, in the name of Jesus Christ. Fail tonight, Lord. Break the heart, Lord. Change and transform. It's a baptism of fire. Father, you say we shall receive power, Lord, fill with power tonight. And may testimonies come from this night in the name of Jesus Christ. It's a promise. God is guilty for his promise. God is obligated to his word. &gt;&gt; It's a gift. And if natural father knows how to grieve, good gift, the Holy Spirit is far better gift than what we can give to our children. Remind him it's a gift. It's a promise. He promises. He say he will pour his spirit in the last day. In the day of Pentecost, they waited 10 days. Tonight it's available. We don't have to wait 10 days. May he cleanse everything that is contrary to his word. Cleanse and wash our homes. Remove every memories &gt;&gt; of things that were contrary to your word. &gt;&gt; Yes. so that we can be children of full obedience. Children that synchronize with your spirit. Children that follow the leadership of the spirit. Children that are glowing and reflecting the word and the light of this hour because our light have come and the glory of the Lord has risen upon us. We ask it father in Jesus precious name. You the God who is rich in glory. You who supply all our needs. You who said in your word that from that fullness we all drinking. Father may your fullness supply to every heart tonight in Jesus precious name. Fill again this building Lord. Fill the extension Lord. Touch this property again in a special way &gt;&gt; in Jesus precious name. Believe it. Believe that he have given to you. He may come very quiet. He may turn you upside down on the floor. He may allow you to feel something in your body. And he may also not even let you feel anything, but he's there. Hold him by his word and continue to water. And from today when that devil comes back, tell him, "Remember this night. The Lord spoke to me. The Lord saw my weaknesses. The Lord came to my rescue. The Lord gave me his spirit and I'm a different child. I'm a different young man. I'm a different person. I have completely changed and he have filled me with his spirit and I'm a candidate that if he come tonight, I will be ready to meet him in the air. This is more important than any other things. Hold on to the promise of God. You have obeyed him. You have spoken to him. He is guilty of his promise. He is guilty of his word. You're not guilty anymore. All you have to do is thank him for giving to you the Holy Spirit tonight and filling you tonight. Thank him and continue to order. Continue to consecrate yourself. Continue to read his word. Don't mind again the devil. And don't mind whatever he's going to try to bring again as a memory. Remind him you were dead that night. God spoke. It was not you that spoken. And if it was for my sake, but it's not for my sake. It is for the sake of his holy name. Even the reason why he's picking up a bride from the Gentile, it's for the sake of his name. It is the decision of God to give unto us the Holy Spirit &gt;&gt; in Jesus precious name. Hold to that promise and go home in peace. Enjoy knowing that God answers prayer. A woman that is not a message believer came in the prayer and receive what she was looking for. She got into the commonwealth of the message and she got her benefit. You do believe the message of the hour. You didn't reject the message of the hour. If God can do that for that lady, he will do that for you too. He just want you to get this first and everything else will take care of itself. Stop worrying. Quit worrying. God is alive. And from today, whatever he says, obey. Work on that possession. Don't linger anymore to act. Be quick to act when he tells you, &gt;&gt; no matter the cost, do what he's telling you to do and he will pack his own word and he will take care of it. Heavenly Father, Lord, we thank you for your blessings tonight for coming Lord Father, our way and stopping by Lord Jesus to bless us in a tremendous way with a wonderful service tonight. Father, thank you for filling our children, for quickening predestinated seed, for touching each one of us here and on the streaming online. Father, thank you again for opening, Lord, another door tonight as we are changing and turning this corner. Lord, Father, we thank you for everything that you have done and we are committing your children unto that hand. Father, I claim the blood upon them. We're going through a cold weather of winter. Lord, protect us and immune us against every viruses, any sicknesses, any allergies, any attack from the world of darkness. Lord, Father, may you stand them, stand between them and the devil and any attack, mental attack and in talks from the devil. Father, give us all travel mercy. And if Tom Terry, may we meet again, Lord, if you have not come back yet, may we meet again to worship you and Lord Father to fellowship about the things of the kingdom. Thank you very much, Lord, Father, for sending your word to heal us because your prophet stated that the sickest body that he knows of is the body of Jesus Christ. And the healing that we needed is the word and you send that word tonight, Lord. And that word have touched us, have made a difference and brought the Holy Spirit in our life, Lord. Father, Lord, we thank you. Protect us, Lord. Fight for us, Lord. Lift up the standard for this church, Lord. We commit everything unto thy hand. All our desire, all our want is in your hand, Lord, in Jesus precious name. &gt;&gt; Amen. Go ahead, brother S. We just want to thank the Lord tonight. Amen. With this song. Thank you, Lord.
