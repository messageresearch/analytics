[51:55] victory
[51:57] glory to God
[52:00] Hallelujah
[52:05] that will be
[52:10] uh
[52:12] okay
[52:14] so you know what is coming up right
[52:17] you know what's coming up right so don't
[52:20] sleep don't get into any distraction
[52:22] let's see where we can get with this
[52:25] Genesis chapter
[52:27] 26 uh chapter 1 verse 26.
[52:34] if you're there you can say a man we're
[52:37] still in the same channel
[52:39] and by God's grace
[52:41] let's see how deep we can go with this
[52:46] everybody there
[52:48] 26 praise God and God say
[52:52] let us make man
[52:55] in our image you might be seated
[52:59] usually when we say image
[53:03] we need to know what we're talking about
[53:06] how does God look like
[53:09] when we say Good Man was created in the
[53:12] image of God was he created like what
[53:15] amen
[53:17] the Bible says this this is Paul who's
[53:19] speaking in second Corinthians chapter 4
[53:22] verse 4 that in whom the God of this
[53:26] world
[53:27] has blinded the minds of them which
[53:30] believe not we already are believers so
[53:32] that's not our part lest the light of
[53:35] the Glorious Gospel of who Christ Christ
[53:38] who is the what image of God so
[53:41] everybody good so the image of God is
[53:45] who Christ we're clear now so let's
[53:47] continue our scripture now so when God
[53:50] say lets us make man in our image so man
[53:55] was a logos
[53:59] amen
[54:03] man look like the pillar of Fire
[54:08] amen I already went through this
[54:12] amen the man that was created looked
[54:15] like a Halo right there
[54:18] the image of God is Christ
[54:21] and Christ is the logos Christos the
[54:25] anointed one
[54:28] that's why you heard brother Brian I'm
[54:29] saying Adam was in the theophany and
[54:31] then he said Adam was bypassing the tea
[54:33] off and we already resolved that
[54:35] question because after he was created in
[54:37] the tearth and God took him away from
[54:39] the tiovanny
[54:41] everybody okay
[54:42] everybody good
[54:47] he's the Father of Lights
[54:52] if he is light God is light if God make
[54:55] bring of bring forth a child that child
[54:58] will be what right
[55:00] is there a problem
[55:01] easy brother Angel all right blessed be
[55:04] the name of the Lord amen he say let us
[55:07] make man in our image
[55:11] after our lives
[55:14] and let them so it's a plural amen have
[55:19] dominion over the fish of the sea God
[55:23] have not created many yet
[55:25] remember that this is his project
[55:28] this is his plan for man what God is
[55:31] putting up together about man
[55:34] amen so your conception in the mind of
[55:39] God goes with your purpose
[55:48] have I lost anyone
[56:31] blessed be the name of the Lord today he
[56:34] will cry amen so when man
[56:37] is created on the conception of God in
[56:41] the mind of God God doesn't create men
[56:45] just like that
[56:46] God didn't create men to see how
[56:48] powerful he is
[56:50] that's not the way God created man no
[56:53] God didn't create men to see if he can
[56:55] make a man
[56:56] God was creating man with a purpose
[57:00] so the conception of man when man is
[57:04] conceived in the mind of God God is
[57:08] mingling his conception with his purpose
[57:13] in other words you can never separate
[57:16] men from his purpose
[57:21] in other words you have a purpose
[57:25] if you are a man
[57:27] if you are created in the image of God
[57:30] you have a purpose amen everybody okay
[57:35] so the conception of men
[57:38] amen and the purpose of man
[57:43] is together
[57:46] amen amen in other words God doesn't
[57:49] create something without a purpose
[57:51] when God want to make something there is
[57:54] a purpose
[57:55] everybody okay the problem is Adam here
[57:59] doesn't exist yet
[58:01] he is in the conception he is in the
[58:04] design room
[58:05] of God Amen God is Discerning Adam and
[58:10] he's Discerning Adam according to the
[58:14] job or the task that Adam will do
[58:19] everybody okay
[58:21] if God is conceiving a woman he is cons
[58:24] he is conceiving a woman with the
[58:27] purpose of what the woman needs to do
[58:31] so when you come in you must carry a
[58:33] baby
[58:34] because you were created as a woman
[58:37] [Applause]
[58:43] if you don't have a baby you need to go
[58:45] back to God
[58:52] are we together
[58:54] okay thank you he say and let them too
[58:58] have dominion
[59:00] the very purpose of man
[59:03] was to have dominion
[59:07] so when man is created he is already in
[59:11] a position to dominate
[59:14] amen dominion over what
[59:17] the Bible says over the fish of the sea
[59:21] over the fall of the year over the
[59:25] cuddle over all the Earth
[59:28] and over every creeping thing that
[59:31] creepeth upon the Earth so man is built
[59:35] to dominate whatever is in this earth
[59:39] everybody good
[59:41] this is God in his design room in his
[59:45] conception now God finished the
[59:48] designing
[59:50] God didn't create Adam until he finished
[59:53] Adam
[59:56] God didn't start making Adam until he
[59:59] finished Adam
[1:00:03] the one that is making your car they
[1:00:06] already have your car on the computer
[1:00:09] man is in the image of God
[1:00:12] when they finish your car in the
[1:00:14] computer the house they building they
[1:00:16] already have your house built sometimes
[1:00:18] when they start construction you will
[1:00:20] see they even give you the picture of
[1:00:22] the house
[1:00:23] in other words your house already
[1:00:25] existed so they don't start the building
[1:00:27] your house if it's not finished already
[1:00:30] on a computer
[1:00:31] the house is already finished on the
[1:00:34] computer
[1:00:36] everybody okay so when they start
[1:00:38] building the house they don't guess
[1:00:45] they don't stop and say what are we
[1:00:47] going to do in this step
[1:00:49] they're just following what he's
[1:00:51] supposed to be doing
[1:00:52] so when God begin to build you
[1:00:56] God will never stop in your life and say
[1:01:00] what am I supposed to do at this time
[1:01:06] in other words whatever you go through
[1:01:09] in your life
[1:01:11] amen God will never stop and God say I
[1:01:16] didn't see this before
[1:01:18] how am I going to deal with this
[1:01:21] before you are built you already
[1:01:24] finished
[1:01:30] glory to God
[1:01:32] amen dominion over what the color over
[1:01:36] the fishes over all the Earth amen
[1:01:39] now verse 27 so God created man now God
[1:01:45] is putting into manifestation what he
[1:01:48] conceived everybody clear
[1:01:50] God is creating man in his own water
[1:01:53] image do you see God changing the
[1:01:55] pattern there he's just following the
[1:01:57] computer
[1:01:59] the computer say In His Image God have
[1:02:02] to stay with his plan
[1:02:04] Amen in his
[1:02:07] when God make his plan
[1:02:10] he will stand for eternity
[1:02:14] because God cannot come back and fix
[1:02:16] something and say there was a mistake
[1:02:18] made like that
[1:02:21] God put his material according to the
[1:02:24] Future
[1:02:27] don't worry my friend we'll get there he
[1:02:30] said in his own image karma in the image
[1:02:33] of who God which is Christ remember in
[1:02:37] the image of God created he him what man
[1:02:41] and what female created he damn now the
[1:02:45] man that was in the computer Mind Of God
[1:02:48] I'm saying that so we on the same page
[1:02:50] in the computer Mind Of God is no longer
[1:02:53] in the computer
[1:02:54] now the man is outside
[1:02:56] now the man is outside he needs to know
[1:02:59] why he's here
[1:03:02] everybody okay God need to tell him what
[1:03:05] he has in his mind
[1:03:10] everybody okay so when you leave the
[1:03:13] conception mind of God and you become a
[1:03:17] reality amen you need to know what was
[1:03:22] in the mind of God before you existed
[1:03:28] you need to know why am I here
[1:03:31] what was in the mind of God when he sent
[1:03:34] me here
[1:03:35] what am I supposed to do
[1:03:38] everybody okay we clear so far we're
[1:03:41] clear
[1:03:44] verse 28 and God did water bless them
[1:03:48] okay the blessing comes the man is
[1:03:50] already created so when you get to your
[1:03:53] relativity you need to wait for the
[1:03:55] blessing of God
[1:03:56] everybody okay
[1:03:58] God bless him you need to follow me
[1:04:01] carefully there are many things that are
[1:04:04] happening in this church that I cannot
[1:04:06] even tell you because some of them are
[1:04:08] private
[1:04:10] so God is doing big things
[1:04:12] in this church
[1:04:14] I can't even tell you because if I tell
[1:04:16] you I was gonna open people's privacy it
[1:04:19] will blow your mind up you just heard
[1:04:21] one here with brother person right
[1:04:24] have you ever get in a discount of a
[1:04:26] hundred sixteen thousand dollars
[1:04:31] you're gonna believe the impossible
[1:04:34] even if you don't want
[1:04:35] [Music]
[1:04:37] I will make you believe the impossible
[1:04:42] I will put it so much into your mind
[1:04:46] until you dream it
[1:04:51] because our mind is so intellectual
[1:04:59] it is for your own benefit
[1:05:01] if I'm fought some of them you will be
[1:05:03] spinning
[1:05:05] because somebody is understanding what
[1:05:08] we're preaching they are believing it
[1:05:10] they're not arguing with it and God is
[1:05:13] blessing them
[1:05:15] amen it's happening here
[1:05:20] so don't stay behind
[1:05:23] watch the word follow the word
[1:05:26] don't follow me follow the word
[1:05:29] everybody okay
[1:05:31] and God blessed them and God say to them
[1:05:35] not to him there were two of them so
[1:05:37] both of them are beneficiary of the same
[1:05:40] thing the woman and the man
[1:05:44] let me leave it alone amen he said be
[1:05:47] fruitful
[1:05:48] and do what multiply and do what
[1:05:51] replenish the Earth so God is now
[1:05:54] responsible to replenish the Earth
[1:05:56] anymore
[1:05:59] you the one to do that
[1:06:02] you don't want to multiply no more God
[1:06:04] amen the commission is multiply number
[1:06:07] one number two be fruitful number one
[1:06:10] number two multiply number three
[1:06:12] replenish the Earth number four sub do
[1:06:15] it and if you notice it's gonna be five
[1:06:18] amen and number five and half Dominion
[1:06:21] five
[1:06:24] everybody okay have dominion over the
[1:06:27] fish of the sea
[1:06:31] of every living thing that moves upon
[1:06:35] the Earth if you notice all these things
[1:06:37] or were already created before Adam
[1:06:43] God created every fish or everything
[1:06:46] else he will Adam was the one that was
[1:06:49] created last so when Adam come to the
[1:06:52] world he looked into the word he's
[1:06:54] seeing creatures that are moving he's
[1:06:57] seeing fishes and he sees uh what do you
[1:07:00] call it uh what founds he sees the ego
[1:07:04] the The Hulk everything then Adam need
[1:07:08] to know should I run away from this or
[1:07:10] should I are these my friend
[1:07:13] everybody okay so God now is telling him
[1:07:16] that everything that you see there you
[1:07:19] need to dominate it in other words when
[1:07:22] Adam meet a lion
[1:07:25] amen the interpretation of Adam for a
[1:07:29] lion it means I need to dominate you
[1:07:36] when Adam meet aware he means dominant
[1:07:43] when Adam meet an elephant no matter
[1:07:46] what the elephant is doing in the mind
[1:07:48] of Adam dominant
[1:07:51] if Adam come across a big mountain his
[1:07:55] man say dominant
[1:07:57] so everything that Adam see is under him
[1:08:04] in other words even if a lion comes
[1:08:06] before Adam and begin to roll Adam will
[1:08:09] be laughing because everything that the
[1:08:12] lion is doing he means dominate
[1:08:16] in other words there was no more fear in
[1:08:19] Adam
[1:08:19] [Applause]
[1:08:23] are we together
[1:08:26] are we together
[1:08:27] a man was conceived in the mind of God
[1:08:31] that man was created but even though
[1:08:34] he's created he need to know the purpose
[1:08:37] that God has in his mind before he
[1:08:40] created him therefore God to reveal to
[1:08:43] man his purpose he comes with a blessing
[1:08:46] and when he blesses the man he's giving
[1:08:49] him instruction or revealing to man the
[1:08:54] purpose for what he created him amen we
[1:08:59] clear so far
[1:09:00] we clear
[1:09:02] listen to what Brad Ibraham says glory
[1:09:04] to God brother Branham says that in
[1:09:07] Genesis 1 26 when God made man
[1:09:11] he made him a god
[1:09:16] because he gave him a dominion and he
[1:09:20] had rulership
[1:09:21] he had power over the birds of the air
[1:09:24] the cattle over the winds the wave the
[1:09:28] fishes of the sea everything he had
[1:09:30] dominion over everything we just read
[1:09:33] that he was a ruler
[1:09:36] and anointed ruler
[1:09:40] because he was in the likeness and in
[1:09:44] the image of God with an Earthly domain
[1:09:47] God gave him the Earth we went through
[1:09:49] that last Sunday that is why the Bible
[1:09:51] says that the Earth is groaning crying
[1:09:54] waiting for the manifestation of the
[1:09:57] sons of God
[1:09:59] the world is waiting for the man to come
[1:10:02] back into his right estate
[1:10:05] amen what is the right to State dominate
[1:10:08] everything
[1:10:09] [Applause]
[1:10:10] not dominate your brother
[1:10:13] not dominate your sister but dominate
[1:10:16] the element of the Earth
[1:10:21] now he is made in the image and the
[1:10:24] likeness of who God that makes him when
[1:10:27] God made him God give him some of his
[1:10:30] water spirit part of his life and he is
[1:10:33] in the likeness and the image of oh god
[1:10:36] let's go to Luke chapter one
[1:10:44] a whole message is already been preached
[1:10:49] amen
[1:10:50] Glory Glory Hallelujah
[1:10:55] if you dare you can say Amen we read
[1:10:58] this last week I'm just going to read
[1:10:59] the portion of it amen amen verse 30 if
[1:11:03] you dare you can say amen amen and the
[1:11:05] angel said to her you remember this now
[1:11:07] fear not
[1:11:10] amen Mary for you have found favor with
[1:11:14] God you remember that last week amen do
[1:11:18] you remember that
[1:11:20] and behold you shall conceive in your
[1:11:23] womb so God promised a seed for the
[1:11:27] woman
[1:11:28] and that seed was Jesus Christ
[1:11:31] but we need to know how is that seed
[1:11:33] coming
[1:11:34] when God say I'm gonna send the seed of
[1:11:37] a woman God put the word seed and the
[1:11:40] woman together
[1:11:41] but a woman doesn't have a seed
[1:11:44] the seed comes from the man so you need
[1:11:47] to know what is God talking about it
[1:11:49] means there will be a woman and there
[1:11:51] will be a seed but that seed doesn't
[1:11:54] belong to that woman
[1:11:56] it is just a combination of a woman with
[1:11:59] a seed they see this crust the woman is
[1:12:03] the carrier of the seed
[1:12:06] now the problem is we need to know now
[1:12:08] who is that woman Isaiah come down he
[1:12:11] say a virgin shall conceive now we know
[1:12:14] that the woman that will conceive or
[1:12:16] carry the seed is going to be a virgin
[1:12:18] that is even more complicated because a
[1:12:21] woman to begin with don't have a seed
[1:12:23] and a virgin is more even sealed than a
[1:12:26] woman who is married in other words how
[1:12:29] can a virgin woman have a seed he have
[1:12:32] to be created by God
[1:12:34] it's a seed that was created by God
[1:12:37] himself
[1:12:38] [Applause]
[1:12:39] it is an Immaculate birth it is not the
[1:12:43] blood of a human it's a created blood of
[1:12:47] God
[1:12:48] everybody clear so far
[1:12:51] but now we know each a virgin
[1:12:54] Every Woman born is a virgin who is that
[1:12:56] woman
[1:12:59] a woman is born but she doesn't know who
[1:13:02] she is
[1:13:03] now God send an angel a messenger
[1:13:10] to reveal to that woman
[1:13:13] the purpose that God has for her on
[1:13:17] Earth
[1:13:18] in other word Mary thought she was just
[1:13:21] a young girl Mary thought she was only
[1:13:24] married to only are engaged to somebody
[1:13:26] she didn't know the thought of God for
[1:13:29] her
[1:13:31] God has a plan for Mary but to receive
[1:13:35] that plan Mary needed some instructions
[1:13:39] we okay now Adam needed some
[1:13:42] instructions
[1:13:46] why do we need those instructions
[1:13:49] amen verse 32 he shall be great and
[1:13:55] shall be called the son of the highest
[1:13:57] and the Lord God shall give him the
[1:13:59] Throne of his fatherhood David
[1:14:02] and he shall reign over the house of
[1:14:04] Jacob forever and his kingdom there
[1:14:07] shall not be no end
[1:14:10] there shall be no end I don't even want
[1:14:12] to add something to the Bible not even
[1:14:15] no
[1:14:16] I don't want it amen then say Mary to
[1:14:20] the angel how is this be
[1:14:23] seeing I know not air man you see the
[1:14:26] seed and the man intellectually is
[1:14:29] kicking in
[1:14:30] Mary have to believe something that was
[1:14:32] never done to anybody
[1:14:37] brother Branham say Elizabeth has
[1:14:40] example in the Bible
[1:14:42] because Sarah had a baby Hannah had a
[1:14:46] baby there were many sparren women that
[1:14:48] had babies but Mary have something that
[1:14:51] was never done
[1:14:53] in other words sometime in your life
[1:14:58] [Applause]
[1:15:02] God might revealed to you something that
[1:15:06] never existed before
[1:15:08] [Applause]
[1:15:14] everybody okay in other words God can
[1:15:17] reveal to you something that nobody else
[1:15:20] has ever done before
[1:15:25] Jesus said the work that I do you shall
[1:15:29] water you also and you will do even how
[1:15:31] greater at the beginning brother Brown
[1:15:34] I'm taught he's gonna repeat what Jesus
[1:15:36] said
[1:15:39] but when the seals were broken brother
[1:15:42] Branham saying no no no no no no no
[1:15:43] greater doesn't mean many more it means
[1:15:47] something greater he said if you notice
[1:15:50] Jesus before he multiplies something
[1:15:53] before he creates something Jesus has to
[1:15:56] use a substance
[1:15:58] they have to give Jesus a fish for him
[1:16:02] to create a fish but Jesus opened the
[1:16:04] door he said you can do more than me
[1:16:08] so brother Branham didn't need anything
[1:16:11] [Applause]
[1:16:14] now brother Branham begin to create out
[1:16:16] of nothing
[1:16:18] [Applause]
[1:16:19] [Music]
[1:16:20] [Applause]
[1:16:29] if the word of God that comes to you
[1:16:32] seems to be impossible to you you need
[1:16:35] to know that you already have the
[1:16:37] potential for that impossible amen
[1:16:42] if not God will never send that word to
[1:16:44] you amen because you can't handle it
[1:16:47] so what God sends you in your life he
[1:16:50] already know you got a receiver for it
[1:16:54] amen
[1:16:55] foreign
[1:16:56] [Applause]
[1:16:59] you see the USB cable
[1:17:03] they match together
[1:17:05] they are some charges that will work on
[1:17:08] my cell phone it won't work in your cell
[1:17:10] phone because we got two different
[1:17:12] phones
[1:17:13] so if God gives you a charger just know
[1:17:16] it's gonna match your phone
[1:17:22] even if he looks strange it's not
[1:17:25] stranger God doesn't make mistake
[1:17:28] [Applause]
[1:17:31] [Music]
[1:17:33] the children God gave you he knows why
[1:17:37] why he gave you those children
[1:17:40] [Applause]
[1:17:47] my God
[1:17:49] where am I at
[1:17:51] verse 35 and the angel answer and say to
[1:17:55] her the water the Holy Ghost
[1:17:59] I know what I'm giving you is too big
[1:18:03] you don't have to worry about it
[1:18:06] all I've came to do is just to tell you
[1:18:09] what it is
[1:18:10] to bring it to pass that's not your
[1:18:12] problem
[1:18:20] God doesn't want you to bring it to pass
[1:18:24] he only wants you to do one thing just
[1:18:27] to accept it
[1:18:31] in other words your acceptance is what
[1:18:35] blocked the Holy Ghost
[1:18:37] if you don't accept the Holy Ghost this
[1:18:40] block if you accept it you release your
[1:18:43] Holy Ghost
[1:18:48] because God knows it's hard for you to
[1:18:50] figure it out
[1:18:51] God wants you to say that I don't
[1:18:54] understand them I know it's hard for me
[1:18:57] to believe it but because at your word
[1:19:01] [Applause]
[1:19:07] because I work Almighty and I didn't
[1:19:10] catch nothing at your word so now I'm
[1:19:15] I'm moving because of what you say
[1:19:18] that's all how the fish are gonna be
[1:19:21] there that's not your problem
[1:19:23] [Applause]
[1:19:27] thank you
[1:19:29] close right here and go home
[1:19:37] when your purpose is revealed you don't
[1:19:41] have to worry about it
[1:19:43] there is somebody who's responded
[1:19:46] irresponsible to make it happen
[1:19:50] because God interpret his word himself
[1:19:56] when he come to bring his word to pass
[1:19:58] he does it himself
[1:20:00] [Applause]
[1:20:03] hey
[1:20:06] when God promised you a baby
[1:20:11] how does the baby get there
[1:20:14] because before you did everything you
[1:20:16] didn't have a baby so how did the baby
[1:20:19] get there and sometimes they bear in
[1:20:21] most of the time all the time the babies
[1:20:23] getting there when you don't even know
[1:20:26] so the one who's maneuvering stuff there
[1:20:29] is not you you sleep I know where the
[1:20:33] baby is and know how to direct the baby
[1:20:35] and put him there
[1:20:39] foreign
[1:20:42] Hallelujah verse 35 and the angel
[1:20:45] answered and said to her the Holy Ghost
[1:20:48] shall come in other words how can this
[1:20:50] be how is this going to happen
[1:20:52] it happened by the Holy Ghost the Holy
[1:20:56] Ghost shall come upon you
[1:20:58] and the power of the highest shall do
[1:21:01] what overshadow thee
[1:21:04] so who's actually putting the baby
[1:21:07] who's actually putting the baby in other
[1:21:10] words something will come over you
[1:21:13] and when it's coming over you it's not
[1:21:15] coming to just make you feel good it is
[1:21:18] coming to do something to create
[1:21:21] something
[1:21:23] amen
[1:21:24] something will come overshadow you
[1:21:27] therefore also the holy thing
[1:21:30] which shall be born of you shall be
[1:21:32] called what the Son of God and behold
[1:21:35] remember this last Sunday your cousin
[1:21:38] Elizabeth she has also conceived a son
[1:21:42] in her what old age and this is the
[1:21:44] sixth month with her who was called
[1:21:46] water bearing so she's no longer Baron
[1:21:49] amen that's why the Bible say the angel
[1:21:52] said who was called it was in the past
[1:21:55] for with God what nothing's
[1:21:59] nothing shall be have impossible with
[1:22:02] who God thank God verse 38 and Mary say
[1:22:06] behold
[1:22:08] they hence made
[1:22:09] of who the Lord
[1:22:15] she didn't say I am the child of my
[1:22:17] father
[1:22:21] she became the hands made of the Lord
[1:22:26] amen the hands made of the Lord beat
[1:22:29] unto me how according to Thy Word
[1:22:35] according to your water and the angel
[1:22:38] did water departed from that's all the
[1:22:40] angel want to hear from her
[1:22:43] I receive it because you said it
[1:22:47] and that said
[1:22:49] that's it
[1:22:51] the remaining I don't know
[1:22:54] everybody good
[1:22:55] let's go to Hebrew and then we start
[1:23:00] Hebrew chapter 4 glory to God
[1:23:04] amen amen amen amen if you dare you can
[1:23:08] say amen amen Hebrew 4 verse 1.
[1:23:13] let us therefore fear lets a promise
[1:23:17] being left of us of entering into his
[1:23:21] water rest any of you seems to come
[1:23:24] water short of it I don't want anybody
[1:23:26] to miss this
[1:23:27] that is what Paul is saying means what
[1:23:30] for to us was the Gospel preach as well
[1:23:35] as to who them the Jews Israel but the
[1:23:39] word which
[1:23:41] [Music]
[1:23:42] so you can listen to the word and it
[1:23:45] doesn't profit you
[1:23:50] you can listen to the word you can go to
[1:23:52] church and everything you're hearing
[1:23:54] doesn't profit you it doesn't change you
[1:23:56] why
[1:23:58] everybody okay you don't want that here
[1:24:01] amen
[1:24:02] he said did not profit them not being
[1:24:05] water mixed with faith in them that do
[1:24:08] water heard it so when the word comes
[1:24:11] remember you must have faith there so
[1:24:14] faith can take the word break it down
[1:24:16] for you and introduce the word in your
[1:24:19] system and now the word begin to benefit
[1:24:22] you
[1:24:23] if there is no faith the word is passing
[1:24:26] it's like you're pouring water on the
[1:24:28] duck's back
[1:24:30] impermeable
[1:24:32] everybody okay
[1:24:34] everybody okay job to verse 10.
[1:24:39] for he that has done what entered into
[1:24:42] his rest
[1:24:44] if you notice it is his rest it's the
[1:24:47] rest of God if you enter into the rest
[1:24:50] of God and we know the rest of God is
[1:24:53] the Holy Ghost
[1:24:54] everybody okay him who enter into his
[1:24:58] rest or him that received the Holy Ghost
[1:25:01] amen comma he also has water ceased from
[1:25:06] his own word so you have your work
[1:25:11] and the work of God
[1:25:13] there's two works amen so meaning this
[1:25:18] person at the beginning has his own work
[1:25:23] but when they enter into the rest of God
[1:25:26] amen their own work is finished
[1:25:31] so the rest of God
[1:25:34] put an end
[1:25:36] to your work
[1:25:40] [Music]
[1:25:44] help me
[1:25:45] you got your work
[1:25:48] amen
[1:25:49] and the work of God and God's work
[1:25:53] amen the Bible says when you enter into
[1:25:57] the rest of God the rest of God switched
[1:26:00] this off
[1:26:05] and it doesn't only switch this one off
[1:26:08] he turned this one on
[1:26:15] remember last Sunday the Bible said we
[1:26:19] were ordained
[1:26:23] predestinated unto good works
[1:26:28] you remember that Sunday you remember
[1:26:31] that Sunday and good is God right
[1:26:34] so there are certain work of you and
[1:26:37] certain work of God in other words you
[1:26:39] are double
[1:26:42] you are you and you are God
[1:26:46] foreign
[1:26:47] come on man we already went through this
[1:26:50] you are double
[1:27:01] everybody okay
[1:27:03] this is one two three is you and this is
[1:27:09] also you
[1:27:12] this one is God
[1:27:16] this one is the natural man
[1:27:19] and the Bible said when the Holy Ghost
[1:27:21] come when you enter into the rest of God
[1:27:25] Amen you cease from you
[1:27:30] you seize from your own work
[1:27:33] [Applause]
[1:27:34] and now God turn on another computer
[1:27:44] verse 10.
[1:27:46] for he that is entered into his rest he
[1:27:50] also has water ceased from his own Works
[1:27:53] he also sees from his own work as God
[1:27:56] did from water so once you receive the
[1:27:59] Holy Ghost your job is finished
[1:28:02] in other words the receiving of the Holy
[1:28:05] Ghost in your life God is coming to put
[1:28:07] an end of you
[1:28:10] so if I have an end of me what start
[1:28:16] amen dear where works that you were
[1:28:19] ordained before the foundation of the
[1:28:22] word and the Bible Ephesians say you
[1:28:25] were ordained unto good works
[1:28:28] we went through that last Sunday
[1:28:30] everybody okay so when the Holy Ghost
[1:28:33] come he turned this man off and he
[1:28:37] turned the Inside Man on so that they
[1:28:40] work
[1:28:41] their purpose
[1:28:44] of God that he had in your life Mary
[1:28:48] don't worry then the Holy Ghost will
[1:28:51] come he will overshadow you and the
[1:28:54] purpose that I'm telling you will be
[1:28:56] fulfilling you
[1:28:57] [Music]
[1:29:01] are we together have I lost anyone
[1:29:04] because with God nothing is water
[1:29:07] impossible now watch with you
[1:29:10] on the board Jesus say unto him if you
[1:29:14] can water
[1:29:15] believe what
[1:29:17] are possible to him that the water
[1:29:19] believe it
[1:29:21] so all things are not just possible to
[1:29:24] God
[1:29:27] you are so you are a god
[1:29:30] when you begin to believe you also all
[1:29:33] things are possible to you
[1:29:36] because God created this word by faith
[1:29:39] [Applause]
[1:29:44] you remember on Wednesday
[1:29:49] [Applause]
[1:29:50] let's pray now Heavenly Father Lord we
[1:29:53] are approaching you humbly this morning
[1:29:55] Father once again thanking you for your
[1:29:58] grace for your love and your mercy and
[1:30:00] for everything you have been doing for
[1:30:02] us father we have done what we can do as
[1:30:05] a man with the ability that you have
[1:30:07] given us from the Holy Spirit Lord may
[1:30:11] you come and move me and move the hero
[1:30:14] of the word completely away from
[1:30:16] ourselves may God speak to God may you
[1:30:20] come and anoint us and reveal to us our
[1:30:23] purpose and what we need to do because
[1:30:26] we need that so much in this time so
[1:30:29] that we will know our destination and
[1:30:32] our path will be easy father be the
[1:30:34] Alpha and the Omega seal every demonic
[1:30:37] spirit away from this place and those
[1:30:40] that were sick has been trouble with
[1:30:42] this weather May you touch them and heal
[1:30:44] them may not leave this church with the
[1:30:47] same symptom that they came in with but
[1:30:50] as they're leaving this church May every
[1:30:53] symptom disappear not by the work of men
[1:30:56] but the work of the Holy Spirit who is
[1:30:59] present in this place we humbly ask it
[1:31:01] father in the name of Jesus Christ amen
[1:31:08] my subject this morning
[1:31:12] is walking the four phases of roof
[1:31:16] walking by revelation
[1:31:19] or vision
[1:31:23] I can even call this working in the
[1:31:27] revelation
[1:31:29] or in division
[1:31:31] I'm gonna repeat it again working by
[1:31:35] Revelation or walking by vision
[1:31:39] we know that Faith according to brother
[1:31:42] Branham is a revelation
[1:31:46] everybody okay
[1:31:48] and Paul says this glory to God Paul
[1:31:52] said in second Corinthians chapter 5
[1:31:55] verse 7 that for we walk by water faith
[1:31:58] and not by water
[1:32:02] Paul is saying we are walking now by
[1:32:06] faith
[1:32:08] everybody okay and we are not working by
[1:32:12] sight
[1:32:15] everybody okay
[1:32:16] everybody okay
[1:32:18] everybody okay another word Paul used to
[1:32:21] walk by sight
[1:32:22] [Music]
[1:32:25] I'm gonna get to that later if the Lord
[1:32:27] help me out but now since Paul is
[1:32:30] converted Paul say from now on I do not
[1:32:34] walk anymore by sight
[1:32:37] I walk by faith and we want you to walk
[1:32:41] by faith by Revelation or vision
[1:32:48] brother Branham says this glory to God
[1:32:51] he says it is a strange thing
[1:32:54] that man who was made in the image and
[1:32:59] the likeness of God and was called of
[1:33:02] him to walk out by faith believing that
[1:33:06] God is will choose to walk by sight
[1:33:09] instead of by faith
[1:33:13] [Applause]
[1:33:15] after his makeup
[1:33:18] he's been and all that Duos were in him
[1:33:22] was fashioned in the likeness of water
[1:33:24] God
[1:33:27] so brother Branham is saying God built
[1:33:30] man a certain way for a purpose
[1:33:34] and instead of man relying on the way
[1:33:38] God built him man is neglecting God
[1:33:43] in him to live with his own ability
[1:33:48] not knowing the power that lays in him
[1:33:52] not understanding the potential that God
[1:33:56] places within him
[1:34:02] brother Branham says and God is that
[1:34:05] great Jehovah who called those things
[1:34:08] which were not as though they were and
[1:34:11] man
[1:34:12] made to live with God in water this
[1:34:15] manner
[1:34:17] so man was made to live like a god
[1:34:22] in other words you call the things that
[1:34:24] are not
[1:34:25] as though they are
[1:34:28] so the problem with you is not about
[1:34:31] saying anything it's saying a thing here
[1:34:34] [Music]
[1:34:36] when you already seen it here any job
[1:34:40] here you can call into it
[1:34:42] [Applause]
[1:34:44] and the thing we're having this will say
[1:34:46] yes I'm coming
[1:34:48] [Music]
[1:34:49] [Applause]
[1:34:53] in other words they think you are
[1:34:55] looking for half an ear
[1:34:57] [Applause]
[1:35:06] father help your children amen
[1:35:09] yet he has chosen to do water walk by
[1:35:12] his side to walk by his side he want to
[1:35:15] be his own water boss
[1:35:20] he wants no one to tell him what I don't
[1:35:23] want nobody to tell me what to do
[1:35:28] [Music]
[1:35:31] me and my wife we don't want anybody to
[1:35:34] tell us what to do
[1:35:35] we don't want anybody to interfere in
[1:35:38] our marriages
[1:35:39] we don't want you to ninja in our family
[1:35:43] don't tell us what to do
[1:35:49] [Music]
[1:35:51] young couples
[1:35:53] everybody okay everybody okay because
[1:35:56] the old one learned the hard way they
[1:35:59] already got so much whooping and now
[1:36:02] they know how to obey God
[1:36:04] but the younger one think that they
[1:36:06] already figure out everything
[1:36:08] so they say don't tell us if anything
[1:36:11] until you get the whooping
[1:36:14] then you will see me waiting for you on
[1:36:16] the counseling and ready to begin to
[1:36:18] rescue you CPR one two three one two
[1:36:22] three until you resuscitate
[1:36:25] everybody okay he said he wants no one
[1:36:29] to tell him what to do that is just the
[1:36:32] nature of her man he proved to be that
[1:36:35] in the garden of water when he had lost
[1:36:38] his fellowship with God by choosing to
[1:36:40] go his own way not have anyone rule over
[1:36:44] what him
[1:36:47] God
[1:36:48] wants us to walk the way he created us
[1:36:52] to walk according to the way he made you
[1:36:55] God Made You in other words when God
[1:36:58] made you a woman stay a woman
[1:37:02] [Applause]
[1:37:07] there is a purpose where God wants you
[1:37:10] to be a woman
[1:37:13] when you want to change from a woman to
[1:37:16] a man you are telling God he made a
[1:37:19] mistake
[1:37:20] [Applause]
[1:37:23] if God made you a man stay amen
[1:37:26] man
[1:37:28] [Applause]
[1:37:30] amen behave like a man
[1:37:33] talk like a man
[1:37:35] run like a man amen shout like a man
[1:37:41] amen
[1:37:44] if God wants you a woman he would have
[1:37:46] made you a woman
[1:37:47] [Applause]
[1:37:51] a world of confusion
[1:37:56] because man don't want God to tell him
[1:37:58] what to do
[1:38:00] God when he look at you he said the best
[1:38:03] that I can do for you you're gonna be a
[1:38:05] man when he looked at you he said the
[1:38:08] best that I can be for you you're gonna
[1:38:10] be a woman you should be proud to be a
[1:38:13] woman
[1:38:14] amen you should be proud to be a man
[1:38:17] amen never desire like I wish I was a
[1:38:20] man no
[1:38:22] never even we get
[1:38:24] be happy the way God Made You God knows
[1:38:28] what he's doing
[1:38:30] [Applause]
[1:38:38] we don't understand what we're doing
[1:38:39] until we get women we turn them into men
[1:38:43] and before you know it we take a woman
[1:38:45] who became a pastor a pastor need to be
[1:38:48] a man
[1:38:50] amen
[1:38:56] because the church in the Bible is a
[1:38:59] woman
[1:39:00] and the pastor is representing God When
[1:39:04] a Woman become a pastor it is a lesbian
[1:39:08] spirit
[1:39:10] amen
[1:39:13] a woman cannot give a seed to a woman
[1:39:16] it's a homosexual spirit
[1:39:18] [Applause]
[1:39:27] [Music]
[1:39:30] no the purpose God created you know why
[1:39:34] you are the Way You Are
[1:39:35] God created you like King stay like him
[1:39:42] God created you God's things came that
[1:39:45] skin amen
[1:39:47] don't change your complexion
[1:39:51] you're a white man remain a white man
[1:39:54] you a black man or a man a black man you

[1:40:00] are Chinese women a Chinese be proud of
[1:40:04] what God Made You
[1:40:06] oh man
[1:40:07] [Applause]
[1:40:14] I don't know if I will get where I'm
[1:40:16] trying to get
[1:40:18] my subject today is walking by water
[1:40:22] Revelation or walking by water Vision
[1:40:24] since we are dealing with Revelation and
[1:40:28] with vision we need to clarify those two
[1:40:31] areas
[1:40:32] amen
[1:40:34] glory to God I'm just reminding you on
[1:40:37] this help me my co-pilot
[1:40:40] brother pranam says that there is three
[1:40:43] elements that water people live in you
[1:40:46] remember this
[1:40:47] first it is why water the humanistic
[1:40:53] amen
[1:40:54] and second is what divine revelation
[1:40:59] which is also called what
[1:41:01] faith
[1:41:04] amen and third is water vision
[1:41:10] amen Vision Amen brother Branham say now
[1:41:14] this explaining humanistic he said like
[1:41:18] in prayer when you pray for anyone in
[1:41:21] water humanistic will y'all say well I
[1:41:25] hope
[1:41:26] you get well
[1:41:28] so hope is a humanistic level that's
[1:41:31] right
[1:41:32] which we already defined to be an
[1:41:35] intellectual faith
[1:41:37] because he uses the brain
[1:41:40] or the first conscience
[1:41:44] you remember all of this that's why I
[1:41:46] tell you to stay up with the sermon
[1:41:49] everybody okay we got a first conscience
[1:41:51] and the subconscious or second
[1:41:53] conscience and brother Branham say I'm
[1:41:55] hoping I'm believing with you trying to
[1:41:58] use all the faith that I can that is
[1:42:00] human
[1:42:02] second is water divine revelation when
[1:42:05] something is revealed to you you just
[1:42:09] know anyway your heart
[1:42:12] amen so Revelation doesn't come with a
[1:42:15] head no sir
[1:42:18] Revelation comes in the heart
[1:42:21] the head is the Hope
[1:42:24] Amen in the heart and the heart is where
[1:42:28] your soul is
[1:42:29] and it's called the subconscious
[1:42:32] or the second conscious
[1:42:35] amen or the second conscience
[1:42:38] Amen brother Branham uses those
[1:42:41] terminology and brother Branham say it
[1:42:44] happened in your heart it's going to
[1:42:46] happen yet there is nothing but just the
[1:42:48] water the Revelation he said and the
[1:42:50] third is water a vision of course that
[1:42:53] is what that says the Lord that is
[1:42:55] perfectly how positive that's why when
[1:42:58] brother Branham saw the vision he always
[1:43:00] say that's safe for the Lord amen
[1:43:04] amen that saved the Lord
[1:43:07] bear with me as I'm climbing
[1:43:10] brother Branham again says this
[1:43:13] following he says that there is three
[1:43:17] elements that people do what do dwell in
[1:43:19] living dwelling this first one is
[1:43:23] humanistic we done we say well I shall
[1:43:27] pray for that person I am hoping that
[1:43:30] now they shall get well now the next is
[1:43:33] divine revelation that is when some
[1:43:36] something done in your heart
[1:43:39] and say it's going to happen then
[1:43:42] something is going to happen then the
[1:43:45] third element is water Vision or the
[1:43:48] word of the Lord made water manifest
[1:43:53] the word of the Lord made manifest
[1:43:59] amen
[1:44:03] if I can make this clear or simple to
[1:44:07] you I'm going to explain it this way
[1:44:11] everybody okay
[1:44:13] this side is the humanistic
[1:44:17] everybody okay and the humanistic
[1:44:20] usually uses your five senses
[1:44:24] which is combined with your brain
[1:44:27] and the man's senses of everything is
[1:44:30] your sight
[1:44:32] we call that division
[1:44:35] or the scene world the visible world
[1:44:38] everybody okay everybody good now the
[1:44:42] other side opposite this is where divine
[1:44:46] revelation Lays
[1:44:48] we call this faith
[1:44:51] and this domain is the invisible one
[1:44:55] and it deals in your heart
[1:44:58] which is dealing with your soul
[1:45:00] everybody clear
[1:45:02] now this humanistic here handle the
[1:45:06] first conscience
[1:45:08] amen the sub uh the the Revelation
[1:45:13] handle the second conscience
[1:45:16] or the subconscious
[1:45:19] everybody okay
[1:45:21] and the easiest way to understand this
[1:45:23] thing the conscience is what you all are
[1:45:26] using right now everybody is right here
[1:45:29] they can look at me they can tell me
[1:45:31] what kind of clothing am I wearing what
[1:45:34] color am I wearing you using your brand
[1:45:36] you're looking at me going to the right
[1:45:37] to the left you're using your first
[1:45:39] conscience everybody okay the
[1:45:42] subconscience usually happen when we go
[1:45:44] to sleep
[1:45:46] when we go to bed this conscience
[1:45:49] doesn't know anything anymore
[1:45:51] amen but you still alive
[1:45:54] the one that is operating when you are
[1:45:56] sleeping is your subconscious that is
[1:45:59] what makes you dream
[1:46:02] everybody okay and you will see yourself
[1:46:04] in the dream talking you will see
[1:46:07] yourself in a dream walking running
[1:46:09] doing everything it looks like you are
[1:46:11] living in another world
[1:46:13] but that world is imaginary and when you
[1:46:16] wake up in the morning everything that
[1:46:18] you saw in the dream was just like a
[1:46:21] like an imagination you just woke up you
[1:46:24] still on your bed everybody okay so the
[1:46:27] subconscious is where you're dreaming
[1:46:30] amen so in between here
[1:46:34] everybody okay this is the domain of a
[1:46:37] vision
[1:46:40] everybody okay in other words the vision
[1:46:43] is a mixture of a revelation plus a
[1:46:48] visual
[1:46:51] I'm going slowly in other words division
[1:46:54] uses the first conscience
[1:46:57] and mix it with a subconscious
[1:47:00] and brother Branham say a vision is when
[1:47:04] someone doesn't go to sleep
[1:47:07] yet he can see something coming up like
[1:47:11] a dream
[1:47:12] brother Branham say what happened is the
[1:47:15] two conscience are stuck together
[1:47:18] it's an intersection of conscience
[1:47:23] everybody okay that's why the vision
[1:47:26] usually uses a vision
[1:47:29] or a dream when you have a vision you
[1:47:32] will see an image
[1:47:34] but it's not real but that image is not
[1:47:38] an image like a dream it's an image it's
[1:47:41] with an instruction
[1:47:43] to tell you what God wants to accomplish
[1:47:47] everybody okay if I lost you raise your
[1:47:50] hand
[1:47:53] glory to God Amen so a vision uses the
[1:47:57] visible and the invisible
[1:48:02] everybody okay Faith is invisible
[1:48:05] humanistic visible 100
[1:48:08] this one invisible 100 that division 50
[1:48:13] 50 you can see an image and that image
[1:48:18] has a revelation in other words God will
[1:48:21] show you a dead baby that is raised
[1:48:23] brother Branham can see the baby smiling
[1:48:26] it means that that baby is going to be
[1:48:28] resurrected amen that is efficient
[1:48:31] everybody okay he can see the baby and
[1:48:34] he have the interpretation of that that
[1:48:36] the baby is gonna leave again everybody
[1:48:38] good
[1:48:39] everybody okay
[1:48:41] thank you Jesus
[1:48:43] third one then we start climbing Brother
[1:48:45] Brad I'm saying remember last night the
[1:48:48] human the water the river and the water
[1:48:51] the vision this is Hope
[1:48:54] I clarified to you there
[1:48:56] the human this is Faith the second one
[1:48:59] and this is perfection that's safe for
[1:49:03] the Lord right now I feel in this realm
[1:49:06] that God is fixing to do something
[1:49:09] I feel real good about something I don't
[1:49:13] know what it is but I feel that he's
[1:49:14] fixing to do something may his Blessing
[1:49:17] come to us now
[1:49:20] seeing that mass subject is about
[1:49:23] walking in the vision of the Revelation
[1:49:27] amen we would like now to exclude this
[1:49:31] guy completely
[1:49:33] because this guy is sight and Paul said
[1:49:36] I walk by faith and not by sight amen
[1:49:40] why are we excluding this thing because
[1:49:43] when we're dealing with the inward man
[1:49:46] the inward man is in the soul
[1:49:50] amen and if you notice the vision has an
[1:49:55] element that is coming from the
[1:49:57] invisible
[1:49:58] and the Revelation is completely
[1:50:01] invisible so in other words the domain
[1:50:04] that usually affects your seed is only a
[1:50:09] revelation or a vision
[1:50:15] the Revelation happened in your soul
[1:50:18] and in your soul you got the
[1:50:20] predestination
[1:50:22] division got an element of the
[1:50:25] Revelation so it still deal with the
[1:50:27] predestinated scene but other than that
[1:50:30] the predestinated seed won't use your
[1:50:33] brain
[1:50:34] because they predestinated seed doesn't
[1:50:36] reason
[1:50:38] amen
[1:50:40] everybody okay
[1:50:42] everybody okay so when we talking about
[1:50:44] working in the vision or working in the
[1:50:48] revelation we are talking about walking
[1:50:51] according to what is in your
[1:50:53] predestinated city
[1:50:57] because other than that you will be
[1:50:59] walking by sight but Paul said we don't
[1:51:02] walk by sight we walk by faith either
[1:51:06] you're gonna walk by faith or you're
[1:51:08] going to walk by Vision which is a
[1:51:10] higher Realm
[1:51:16] are we together
[1:51:18] why are you saying that brother Branham
[1:51:21] says this remember last Sunday when he
[1:51:24] could draw to his own water so what is
[1:51:27] in your soul that you join us see if
[1:51:29] there is water anything in there so in
[1:51:32] your soul there must be something there
[1:51:34] for you to draw
[1:51:36] and we found out that the people that
[1:51:38] are the children of God in the sword
[1:51:40] they got a seed we already went that to
[1:51:43] that clear in the ark of the in the in
[1:51:46] the Tabernacle you got the Ark of the
[1:51:47] Covenant he said if there is anything in
[1:51:50] there to do it
[1:51:52] but if the predestinated seed don't miss
[1:51:56] this now if that predestinated seed is
[1:51:59] not in there
[1:52:01] he will not judge through there because
[1:52:03] it shall draw from water
[1:52:06] so you must have a seed of God inside
[1:52:09] there because inside the seed there is a
[1:52:12] package
[1:52:14] remember last week everybody okay
[1:52:17] this is where we stopped last Sunday
[1:52:19] let's go
[1:52:20] Paul say what shall we then say to these
[1:52:24] things if God Be Water for us who can be
[1:52:28] how against us in either way nothing can
[1:52:31] block you
[1:52:36] if God has already determined something
[1:52:38] for you it's finished
[1:52:41] he's the absolute
[1:52:43] he is the top his decision is final
[1:52:49] if God have not spoken yet you can
[1:52:51] speculate
[1:52:53] you can say anything you want but once
[1:52:56] God brings that self the Lord or once
[1:52:59] God bring the Revelation he means
[1:53:02] everybody need to shut
[1:53:06] everybody good
[1:53:08] Paul say he despair not his own son you
[1:53:12] remember this The Treasure of heaven but
[1:53:15] deliver him up for us oh now let's get
[1:53:19] to our material ha shall he not with him
[1:53:23] also do what really give us all things
[1:53:27] God gave you the biggest treasure of
[1:53:30] Heaven which is the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:53:33] you remember that Sunday he looked at
[1:53:36] you he looked at Jesus Christ he
[1:53:38] esteemed you more than Jesus Christ
[1:53:40] and he put Jesus to be killed
[1:53:43] because of you and Paul is saying if the
[1:53:46] greatest thing in heaven
[1:53:48] can be trampled on the ground
[1:53:50] because of you tell me what else can God
[1:53:54] not give you in your life
[1:53:56] [Applause]
[1:53:58] because the greatest thing God can give
[1:54:00] you in your life is Jesus Christ amen
[1:54:02] and God already delivered Jesus Christ
[1:54:05] from you anything else is below Jesus
[1:54:08] Christ
[1:54:09] if you can touch God to the level of
[1:54:13] Jesus Christ what else is anything else
[1:54:16] that God cannot give you
[1:54:18] [Applause]
[1:54:22] everybody okay that's why God tested
[1:54:26] Abraham
[1:54:27] with his own son when God when Abraham
[1:54:32] was able to give God his only son God
[1:54:36] look he said Abraham you pass the last
[1:54:39] test
[1:54:40] because of what you do I will multiply
[1:54:43] you I will bless you I will fight your
[1:54:47] enemy whoever says something bad about
[1:54:49] you I will be his enemy why because
[1:54:52] Abraham you pass the last person and the
[1:54:56] last test is to give your only begotten
[1:54:59] son
[1:55:00] and God did it another word Abraham if
[1:55:04] you can give Isaac I don't have to ask
[1:55:07] you anything else because I know
[1:55:09] anything I will ask you you will give it
[1:55:10] to me
[1:55:12] if I would get if I would have asked you
[1:55:14] give me a donkey you will give it to me
[1:55:16] so I went to the top I said give me
[1:55:18] Isaac
[1:55:20] your only begotten if you are willing to
[1:55:22] give me Isaac so there is nothing that
[1:55:25] Abraham can refuse to me
[1:55:27] now because of that I can open up the
[1:55:30] treasure Abraham in blessing I will
[1:55:33] bless you in multiply I will multiply
[1:55:36] you I will multiply your seed your seed
[1:55:39] shall possess the Gate of your enemy why
[1:55:43] because you passed the last test
[1:55:45] [Applause]
[1:55:50] so when we were in trouble God also
[1:55:53] showed you his last test towards you
[1:55:56] in other words God is telling you like
[1:55:58] Abraham I am ready to give up my child
[1:56:01] for you in other words you need to
[1:56:03] understand my language that there is
[1:56:06] nothing else that you can ask me and I'm
[1:56:09] not able to give you
[1:56:13] thank you
[1:56:13] [Applause]
[1:56:20] because the Son of God that I gave is
[1:56:24] nobody else but myself
[1:56:27] I give my honor because of you tell me
[1:56:31] what else can I give you
[1:56:35] what is hard in your life that I cannot
[1:56:37] provide because I provide for the
[1:56:40] greatest thing that you cannot pay you
[1:56:43] owe a debt you could not pay and I paid
[1:56:46] that debt show me another death show me
[1:56:50] another problem that you have in your
[1:56:52] life that that cannot help you
[1:56:55] [Applause]
[1:57:05] are we coming together are we coming
[1:57:08] together
[1:57:09] [Music]
[1:57:09] [Applause]
[1:57:13] Paul sometimes we read the Bible we
[1:57:16] don't understand what we're reading now
[1:57:18] Paul is saying so if God did that and
[1:57:22] gave you that how how
[1:57:25] how can not God give you freely
[1:57:30] did you pay God to give you Jesus
[1:57:33] the greatest treasure was given for free
[1:57:36] so what else is under Jesus that you
[1:57:39] need to pay for
[1:57:41] that's why everything else must be free
[1:57:44] everybody okay
[1:57:47] so how cannot God give you how freely
[1:57:52] what all things
[1:57:56] [Music]
[1:57:59] not when we say all things is fake
[1:58:07] amen
[1:58:09] because God has many things
[1:58:12] amen
[1:58:14] if you're a man you cannot ask God to
[1:58:16] carry a pregnancy
[1:58:22] it's only a woman that can ask God to
[1:58:25] carry a pregnancy it is a blessing but
[1:58:28] it's not for men
[1:58:32] so we need to be specific
[1:58:36] on what should I know
[1:58:38] [Applause]
[1:58:38] [Music]
[1:58:40] because God has many things what
[1:58:44] belonged to me add of those many things
[1:58:49] [Music]
[1:58:52] Ephesians 1 verse 1 11 in whom also we
[1:58:56] have water obtained an inheritance so we
[1:58:59] have obtained any inheritance being how
[1:59:01] predestinated according to the water
[1:59:04] purpose of him so we have a purpose
[1:59:08] the purpose of God
[1:59:10] for us amen who worketh all things what
[1:59:14] after the Council of his own will
[1:59:19] so everything that is going in or going
[1:59:23] on in your life if you have a
[1:59:27] predestinated sin God Is Watching to
[1:59:31] make sure everything is going according
[1:59:35] to his plan
[1:59:37] his purpose his cancer for you
[1:59:43] in other words if God sends you to be a
[1:59:46] pilot your whole life will begin toward
[1:59:49] that way God will make sure nothing move
[1:59:53] you from that path
[1:59:56] and God will make sure all your trial
[1:59:59] continue to push you toward that
[2:00:02] direction
[2:00:05] in other words everything that you is
[2:00:08] going through God is orchestrating them
[2:00:11] according to his plan
[2:00:15] another way there is nothing at the
[2:00:18] career in your life
[2:00:21] even though he looked chaos there is no
[2:00:23] chaos
[2:00:24] God is the one that allowed the chaos
[2:00:27] sometimes
[2:00:34] my friend
[2:00:35] don't worry my friend we going
[2:00:39] that mystery that purpose that God has
[2:00:43] in your life
[2:00:44] God usually called that purpose in a
[2:00:48] mystery
[2:00:50] in other words God seal it God hide it
[2:00:53] in a mystery so nobody knows what it is
[2:00:59] everybody okay so when you're trying to
[2:01:01] know that God lock it when the devil
[2:01:04] wants to look it up the devil can look
[2:01:06] look but he doesn't understand
[2:01:08] because it doesn't belong to him
[2:01:13] glory to God brother Barnum say uh Paul
[2:01:17] says but we speak the wisdom of God in
[2:01:20] water a mystery why
[2:01:22] why should Jesus speak in Parable
[2:01:23] because Jesus said listen the reason why
[2:01:26] I'm talking to Parable it's not to them
[2:01:28] to understand this thing it is to you
[2:01:33] everybody okay okay he says even the
[2:01:37] what hidden wisdom which God did what
[2:01:40] ordained when before the world our Glory
[2:01:44] so that purpose of God is For Your Glory
[2:01:49] [Music]
[2:01:52] may God help me reach where I want to
[2:01:54] reach
[2:01:55] so the purpose that God has for you is
[2:01:59] not for your distraction
[2:02:01] because God proved to you that he
[2:02:04] already put something in you
[2:02:08] that belonged to you God put something
[2:02:11] in you to identify Who You Are
[2:02:16] God put his fingerprint on you
[2:02:20] God put his DNA on you
[2:02:23] [Music]
[2:02:24] [Applause]
[2:02:29] one day you've sinned
[2:02:33] amen
[2:02:34] and Eve did the problem
[2:02:36] the Bible say Adam was the son of God
[2:02:40] that's what the scriptures say in Luke 3
[2:02:42] 38 Adam was the son of God when Adam
[2:02:45] looked at Eve
[2:02:47] if you notice when God came God struck
[2:02:50] The Serpent and flipped him completely
[2:02:52] and change him from another creature to
[2:02:54] another creature but God never changed
[2:02:57] Adam
[2:02:59] when Adam looked at him he say my wife
[2:03:01] is in trouble
[2:03:03] do you know what Adam did Adam took his
[2:03:05] seed
[2:03:07] and put it in evil
[2:03:12] everybody okay when God is coming
[2:03:15] who did this it is when God look at it
[2:03:17] if you look inside is he able
[2:03:23] [Music]
[2:03:23] [Applause]
[2:03:25] do you follow me
[2:03:27] in other words God cannot destroy you
[2:03:31] because destroying it will destroy evil
[2:03:34] Adam put a lock
[2:03:37] so that God cannot do anything
[2:03:39] [Applause]
[2:03:39] [Music]
[2:03:42] so in your life when you are born God
[2:03:45] put the predestinated scene
[2:03:48] [Applause]
[2:03:54] so no matter how much God is upset
[2:03:58] towards you when God is so mad because
[2:04:02] of what you're doing
[2:04:04] why did he look in you
[2:04:07] [Applause]
[2:04:08] God back up another thing because there
[2:04:11] is a path of God in you
[2:04:13] God cannot destroy God
[2:04:16] [Applause]
[2:04:26] if he destroy you he destroyed himself
[2:04:31] [Applause]
[2:04:42] Jesus has to trouble disciple
[2:04:46] Jesus had two disciples that were very
[2:04:48] troublesome
[2:04:49] they were his church remember that was a
[2:04:52] headache one of them was Peter another
[2:04:55] one is Judah why did he pray for Peter
[2:04:58] and don't pray for Judah
[2:05:00] because every time he looked at Peter he
[2:05:03] said oh boy this belonged to me
[2:05:06] because the Bible said he knew Judah
[2:05:08] from the beginning and he also knew
[2:05:11] Peter when peace they want to go to
[2:05:13] trouble he said don't worry be there I
[2:05:15] pray for you
[2:05:16] [Applause]
[2:05:20] Peter you won't fail
[2:05:22] your faith Warfare you're gonna go
[2:05:25] through headache but remember you all
[2:05:27] fail
[2:05:28] I pray for you even though the devil
[2:05:31] spoke through you but still the devil
[2:05:35] cannot have you
[2:05:37] [Applause]
[2:05:41] people was anointed by Satan but Jesus
[2:05:45] never gave up to be there because he
[2:05:48] said then you can take Judah but not
[2:05:50] this one this one I claim him
[2:05:54] this belonged to me and when Jesus is
[2:05:58] resurrecting the first disciple he's
[2:06:01] asking God tell Peter I want to make you
[2:06:04] happy that is all right
[2:06:05] [Music]
[2:06:10] in other words when I took my journey to
[2:06:13] paradise I was worrying about Peter now
[2:06:16] that I finished my journey as soon as I
[2:06:19] come back while speeder Peter is good
[2:06:20] okay that's it come on Peter come on be
[2:06:24] the I'm gonna give you the
[2:06:25] Keys of the Kingdom
[2:06:26] [Applause]
[2:06:27] [Music]
[2:06:33] nothing can change God's plan for you
[2:06:36] if God be for you who can be against you
[2:06:40] [Applause]
[2:06:44] allow me to move my friend I'm trying
[2:06:48] Paul says which none of the prince of
[2:06:51] this world knew
[2:06:52] for they had known it they would have
[2:06:55] not watered crucified the Lord Of Glory
[2:06:57] but as it is written eyes has not what
[2:07:00] see so it's not visible yet
[2:07:03] and no ear has what nobody has preached
[2:07:07] yet
[2:07:08] neither have he entered into the water
[2:07:11] man it's not a revelation yet
[2:07:15] so God hide it
[2:07:17] [Applause]
[2:07:18] nobody have seen it yet nobody has
[2:07:22] preached it yet I have not taught you
[2:07:24] yet but I made you for a purpose
[2:07:28] I created you for a purpose
[2:07:31] that purpose I and you alone
[2:07:35] [Applause]
[2:07:39] Oh Glory to God
[2:07:43] I have not seen no ear has water neither
[2:07:48] enter into the heart of her man where
[2:07:50] Revelation come the water things plural
[2:07:53] with who God has water prepare it's
[2:07:57] prepared
[2:07:58] for what them that love him
[2:08:06] what does love him means
[2:08:09] because he is the word
[2:08:11] and Jesus say I am the way I am the
[2:08:14] truth and the Bible say God put the love
[2:08:17] of the truth
[2:08:19] in you so you can be safe
[2:08:22] so this guy here love God
[2:08:26] and if he loved God God has something
[2:08:28] prepared for this guy
[2:08:32] but he sealed it he hide it in a mystery
[2:08:36] walking by Vision Oh by Revelation amen
[2:08:40] how do we know that he said but God has
[2:08:45] water revealed them unto us by water his
[2:08:48] spirit
[2:08:53] all things for the water spirit such as
[2:08:57] water all things
[2:09:00] the spirit such as water all things he
[2:09:03] had given us freely water and the Spirit
[2:09:06] come and searches what all things to
[2:09:09] know what belongs to you amen
[2:09:11] [Music]
[2:09:12] the spirit of God when he comes in your
[2:09:16] life he's bringing the specific purpose
[2:09:19] of God for your life
[2:09:30] deep things of God do you want me to
[2:09:33] preach the things
[2:09:35] oh we don't want deep things
[2:09:37] How Are You Gonna Know Who You Are how
[2:09:40] are you going to know the purpose of God
[2:09:42] for you
[2:09:43] because those things are deep in God
[2:09:46] they are not on the front part of God
[2:09:48] they are in God bad part man we need the
[2:09:52] spirit of God to go inside and tell us
[2:09:55] what do we need in our life
[2:10:01] and I continue
[2:10:02] for what man knoweth defense of water

[2:10:18] even so the things of water God no man
[2:10:21] knoweth but the water spirit of God so
[2:10:23] it takes the spirit of God to go in the
[2:10:26] mind of God

[2:10:33] to see I'm God I'm coming here for

[2:30:57] form of things
[2:30:59] for I am who God and there is no one
[2:31:02] else I am God and there is none like me
[2:31:06] how is that God he declared the end from
[2:31:10] the water beginning in other words when
[2:31:13] he start he already finished
[2:31:15] amen everybody okay from ancient storm

[2:31:29] have conceived on my mind I will fulfill
[2:31:32] it
[2:31:33] and I already conceive it before the
[2:31:36] beginning
[2:31:37] because before I begin to make Adam I
[2:31:39] already have Adam
[2:31:42] and I already seen the life of Adam
[2:31:44] that's the reason why I'm speaking these
[2:31:47] things about Adam
[2:31:50] I love Jacob
[2:31:53] when I say I love him I don't tell you
[2:31:55] that I didn't see he will lie
[2:31:58] that's not my problem the problem is
[2:32:01] what I have purpose for Jacob
[2:32:06] what have Jacob done nothing
[2:32:11] did he please you in eternity no I just
[2:32:15] declare that I love Jacob

[2:32:27] all the plants that I have that I wanted
[2:32:31] towards you think conception toward who
[2:32:34] you what are those plans
[2:32:38] say the who the Lord so God is saying
[2:32:41] that I have plans toward you I have a
[2:32:44] mind I have a purpose towards you what
[2:32:48] is that purpose he said thought of what
[2:32:51] peace
[2:32:54] and not of water evil to give you a
[2:32:58] water
[2:32:59] in either way to give you a future
[2:33:02] so my plan for you will make you
[2:33:05] somewhere it will take you from point A
[2:33:09] to Z
[2:33:13] father
[2:33:14] help me now let's get to the meat
[2:33:16] brother Branham saying in this we will
[2:33:20] liken the word of God
[2:33:22] God is a great water architect
[2:33:26] follow me carefully
[2:33:28] he's a great water Builder as God puts
[2:33:32] in his building water nothing but the
[2:33:35] water the very best
[2:33:38] [Applause]
[2:33:40] God when he built something
[2:33:43] he watches what material
[2:33:46] he's using
[2:33:49] and brought upon him say when God is
[2:33:51] building you he does nothing but put the
[2:33:56] very best material
[2:33:58] why is God infested with the best
[2:34:01] material
[2:34:02] why listen carefully my friend
[2:34:06] brother Branham say God building the
[2:34:09] foundation will put water nothing else
[2:34:12] but the water the best that there is
[2:34:15] because God is thoughtful of water his
[2:34:19] reputation
[2:34:21] amen
[2:34:25] God doesn't want people to make fun of
[2:34:29] him
[2:34:31] amen
[2:34:32] [Applause]
[2:34:33] that's why when Israel sin
[2:34:36] and God wanna destroy it Moses knowing
[2:34:40] God say don't worry about it you can
[2:34:43] destroy them all you want but Remy
[2:34:46] kindly reminds you
[2:34:48] you see the high part you see the
[2:34:52] Egyptians you see the German they will
[2:34:55] be laughing at you they will say you
[2:34:57] were God without power
[2:34:59] you take people to kill them
[2:35:02] when God remember his reputation he said
[2:35:06] no I must be the big God I must be the
[2:35:09] big shark
[2:35:11] God doesn't play with his reputation
[2:35:14] [Applause]
[2:35:21] what I'm trying to tell you is if you
[2:35:25] fail God failed
[2:35:30] you didn't get me well if you fail you
[2:35:33] will destroy the reputation of God
[2:35:35] because God invested so much in you
[2:35:43] if you fail
[2:35:46] you make God look like he didn't know
[2:35:49] how to create you
[2:35:51] because God invested his intelligence
[2:35:54] and he does the word his intelligence to
[2:35:57] be insulted
[2:35:58] [Music]
[2:36:03] listen my friend Isaiah water
[2:36:07] 48 verse water eleven for my own sake
[2:36:11] even for my own not for you for me
[2:36:15] for me not for he has nothing to do for
[2:36:18] with you this is me God this is me he
[2:36:21] repeat it twice this is me he said for
[2:36:24] my own water for my own water saying
[2:36:26] without water do it so I would do it
[2:36:29] because of me
[2:36:32] why for how should my man be water
[2:36:36] polluting I will not give my glory unto
[2:36:40] water another
[2:36:41] [Applause]
[2:36:46] if you have the glory goes to the devil
[2:36:51] and the devil will say I'm powerful than
[2:36:53] God
[2:36:54] God will never let that allow God that's
[2:36:58] why God equip you a certain way that's
[2:37:02] why you kiss him
[2:37:05] that's why even if you feel like you
[2:37:08] giving up you will feel something rising
[2:37:10] up
[2:37:12] it is not you it is God
[2:37:15] resisting
[2:37:17] [Applause]
[2:37:23] in other words when you reach a point in
[2:37:27] your life that you're trying to give
[2:37:29] away the god in you will wake up and say
[2:37:32] hey we're just about to lose a
[2:37:35] reputation here
[2:37:36] if she lost the whole neighborhood will
[2:37:39] say that message of William Marion
[2:37:41] Branham is alive but this message is the
[2:37:44] truth you will hear a stress coming from
[2:37:47] within
[2:37:48] [Applause]
[2:37:52] Glory
[2:37:54] in other words they challenge your God
[2:37:59] and your God is powerful
[2:38:01] my God is tremendous
[2:38:04] his strength never ended
[2:38:06] he will jump into the fire just to save
[2:38:10] a sinner like you
[2:38:13] why because he will never let his
[2:38:16] reputation be destroyed God cannot send
[2:38:20] people playing with his reputation you
[2:38:24] are his reputation
[2:38:25] [Applause]
[2:38:31] that's why whatever he puts in you is
[2:38:35] always the best
[2:38:36] the way God created you he created you
[2:38:39] with the best
[2:38:40] [Applause]
[2:38:45] why are you still alive till today
[2:38:49] why are you still alive
[2:38:51] why are you stealing this message
[2:38:54] despite everything
[2:38:57] despite the disappointment why are you
[2:39:00] still holding on it is not you holding
[2:39:03] on
[2:39:04] if you fail God failed
[2:39:07] help me
[2:39:09] help me my friend I'm trying to search
[2:39:10] for the airport he says God is
[2:39:13] thoughtful of water his reputation he's
[2:39:16] a god of what eternity he's a god of
[2:39:19] water heavens and earth he will never
[2:39:21] put nothing in his architect plan here
[2:39:24] but that would water stands at the time
[2:39:28] test the time pets for weapon eternity
[2:39:33] whatever God put in your life there is
[2:39:36] no trial that will destroy that
[2:39:38] even when you think like you went to go
[2:39:41] you didn't go too low the devil beat
[2:39:44] brother Branham beat brother Branham and
[2:39:46] brother Branham says something Rose in
[2:39:47] me

[2:39:49] Hallelujah
[2:39:51] say brother Barnum say I better do what
[2:39:54] leave that we get into water shouting
[2:39:57] and get away we we get to thinking about
[2:40:00] what that if I begin to go deep into
[2:40:03] this you all will be shouting just like
[2:40:05] you did
[2:40:06] because God for that is just as true as
[2:40:10] God is how true God would never lose his
[2:40:13] reputation
[2:40:14] because he invested so much in you if
[2:40:18] you fail his product fell
[2:40:21] he's Masterpiece fell
[2:40:24] God don't want to sell a product and
[2:40:26] they come back they say this is junk

[2:40:32] have to perform according to the
[2:40:35] manufacture

[2:44:48] [Music]
[2:44:51] for a task
[2:44:52] for a purpose that you wanted to do
[2:44:57] everybody okay when he said I ordain you
[2:45:01] to be prophet of the nation
[2:45:03] verse 6
[2:45:05] then then said I Jeremiah he says what

[2:45:18] you say you knew me all this time
[2:45:23] can I continue he said ah Lord behold I
[2:45:28] cannot what speak for I am water a child
[2:45:31] stop
[2:45:33] there is two things here
[2:45:37] okay please allow me there is two things
[2:45:41] here there is the present stage
[2:45:47] amen and there is what we call truth
[2:45:54] the present stage is what built you
[2:45:58] until what you are now
[2:46:01] the present stage is filled with your
[2:46:05] civilization
[2:46:07] is filled with your family trait
[2:46:11] is filled with your genetics it's filled
[2:46:15] with your environment
[2:46:16] it's filled with everything the nation
[2:46:19] that you came out of it put in you
[2:46:23] and that form you
[2:46:25] and you accepted that to be you
[2:46:30] so when they say who's you you say this
[2:46:33] is me I'm an American
[2:46:35] now God is coming and say
[2:46:38] I'm saying you are not an American
[2:46:44] you are not an African
[2:46:47] that's just the nation that I chose to
[2:46:50] introduce you to this world
[2:46:53] before you become an American I know you
[2:46:59] do you follow me before you are what you
[2:47:02] are I already predestinated you to be
[2:47:05] something
[2:47:06] so now the battle begin between the
[2:47:10] truth or the word of God
[2:47:15] or the revelation of God
[2:47:18] all the vision of God
[2:47:21] and who you thought to you
[2:47:27] who they touch you you were
[2:47:29] so Jeremiah begin to bring God who he
[2:47:34] thought is
[2:47:35] he said God you don't understand me
[2:47:38] me being a prophet I don't even know how
[2:47:42] to speak
[2:47:43] how can God anoint somebody to be a
[2:47:48] prophet who will not know how to speak
[2:47:53] do you think God made a mistake no sir
[2:47:57] if God saw that speaking could be a
[2:48:02] problem he would not have sent Moses
[2:48:05] [Applause]
[2:48:09] everybody okay because Moses taught God
[2:48:13] I mean I have a problem of speech God
[2:48:16] said who formed the mouth
[2:48:19] so you think when I'm coming to you I
[2:48:21] didn't know you have a problem of speech
[2:48:23] do you think that's my problem whatever
[2:48:25] comes from your problem that's not what
[2:48:27] I'm looking at
[2:48:29] I want to bring you where we started
[2:48:32] do you follow me
[2:48:34] it's a banner between your present stage
[2:48:37] and what is truth truth is what God is
[2:48:40] telling you
[2:48:43] listen to me but uh Apostle uh Jeremiah
[2:48:48] say I say behold I cannot what for I am
[2:48:51] water a child
[2:48:53] but the Lord said unto me say not I am a
[2:48:58] water a child because I am speaking to
[2:49:01] you now you need to change your
[2:49:03] vocabulary
[2:49:08] in other words Jeremiah now you need to
[2:49:11] be working according to my vision
[2:49:15] no matter what they told you you are no
[2:49:19] matter what you are now no matter what
[2:49:21] you did you need to start changing your
[2:49:25] vocabulary and use my vocabulary and
[2:49:29] begin to deny your greatest enemy
[2:49:32] [Music]
[2:49:36] this man that Jeremiah was defending
[2:49:39] brother Branham call him the greatest
[2:49:42] enemy
[2:49:43] [Music]
[2:49:45] everybody okay why is he an enemy become
[2:49:49] he became because he become a blockage
[2:49:52] to implementing God's Vision in your
[2:49:55] life
[2:49:56] he became a blockage for you to begin to
[2:49:59] walk by revelation
[2:50:01] God is trying to bring you the new
[2:50:03] Direction in your life but this man
[2:50:06] begin to block it and say you don't
[2:50:09] understand I will stop that I'm
[2:50:12] incapable of going that direction
[2:50:15] I will start that with my education I
[2:50:18] cannot preach to King
[2:50:22] they told me you were seven years
[2:50:24] education there is nowhere you can stand
[2:50:26] before King
[2:50:28] he said William Martin I am the one
[2:50:31] sending you
[2:50:32] I am the one telling you when I tell you
[2:50:35] something you need to acknowledge me
[2:50:38] and speak like me
[2:50:40] because I already ordained you for what
[2:50:43] I'm telling you
[2:50:45] what I'm telling Adam is not different
[2:50:48] than what I already made Adam for what
[2:50:51] I'm telling Mary I know Mary will
[2:50:54] receive my word
[2:50:58] oh my God he said that shall go to all
[2:51:03] that I shall send you
[2:51:06] and whatsoever command thee that shall
[2:51:08] do what speak be not what afraid of the
[2:51:11] water your face for what I am with thee
[2:51:14] do you do what deliver thee say what the
[2:51:17] Lord
[2:51:19] God help me then the Lord put forth his
[2:51:23] hand and touched my mouth
[2:51:25] where you got the trouble and the Lord
[2:51:27] said unto him behold I have put my word
[2:51:30] in that now see I have said
[2:51:35] set thee all for the water the Nations
[2:51:38] he was already predestinated for it and
[2:51:40] offered the kingdom to do what root out
[2:51:43] and to do what pull down and to do it
[2:51:46] destroy and to do whatever throw down
[2:51:48] and to do water and to do what it's a
[2:51:50] plan look at the potential that is in
[2:51:52] Jeremiah
[2:51:54] so if Jeremiah want to plant he will
[2:51:57] plan if you want to rule that he ruled
[2:51:59] out
[2:52:00] God said this is my plan for you my plan
[2:52:04] for you was not what you're doing
[2:52:06] Peter he was not fishing

[3:02:26] Lord decem this morning and this
[3:02:29] afternoon
[3:02:32] father your word has been laid out
[3:02:38] and we continue to understand deeply
[3:02:41] what your Prophet stated
[3:02:43] that he can never overemphasize
[3:02:46] the need of a revelation
[3:02:48] for a believer
[3:02:51] Lord
[3:02:52] every person that is here
[3:02:54] even that is streaming now
[3:02:58] online
[3:02:59] you created them
[3:03:02] for a purpose
[3:03:03] before they were even formed
[3:03:06] before they came out for their mother's
[3:03:09] womb
[3:03:09] father you had a plan for them
[3:03:13] and the plan
[3:03:15] was to give them an expected end
[3:03:18] and it was a plan for their Glory
[3:03:22] father we came into this world
[3:03:25] we got caught
[3:03:26] into our neighborhood
[3:03:29] we got caught into our civilization
[3:03:32] we got caught on the spiritual amnesia
[3:03:36] we got caught
[3:03:37] in many various different
[3:03:41] things into this world
[3:03:43] until
[3:03:45] we are acting we are living
[3:03:49] we are reacting
[3:03:51] Beyond
[3:03:52] and Below what you expected as Lord
[3:03:56] father to be living in
[3:03:58] but father
[3:04:00] there is a from that time
[3:04:03] for everybody Lord
[3:04:05] there was a Dharma
[3:04:07] that we mind our own businesses
[3:04:10] there was a time that we did our own
[3:04:12] works
[3:04:14] and what we reap from that he's a
[3:04:17] loudest car
[3:04:18] a lot of headache a lot of gray hair
[3:04:22] a lot of bumping here and there
[3:04:25] before we can figure it out in the right
[3:04:27] way
[3:04:28] but father your children were not meant
[3:04:32] to live like that
[3:04:34] your words say
[3:04:36] that you sent your word to heal them
[3:04:39] and now you are coming to reveal the
[3:04:41] very purpose that you sent all of us
[3:04:44] here on this Earth we have a specific
[3:04:48] mission
[3:04:49] we have a specific purpose we have a
[3:04:52] specific plan we have a specific project
[3:04:55] we have wasted so much time
[3:04:58] we have turned around this mountain so
[3:05:01] much
[3:05:03] until we forget that the destination was
[3:05:06] the Promised Land
[3:05:08] a destination that could take three days
[3:05:11] you have taken 40 years
[3:05:14] father may you be merciful to us
[3:05:17] may you be merciful to each person here
[3:05:19] and those that are streaming and those
[3:05:22] that I will Stream So that each one will
[3:05:26] receive their personal revelation
[3:05:28] of the purpose
[3:05:31] that you send them
[3:05:34] in this world
[3:05:36] and may father you give each person the
[3:05:39] ability
[3:05:40] to be able to surrender
[3:05:43] their own thoughts
[3:05:45] their own thinking they're all proud
[3:05:48] their own agenda
[3:05:51] and father to begin to rely on the mind
[3:05:55] of Christ and to give way to the mind of
[3:05:59] Christ
[3:06:00] to be able to operate the will of God in
[3:06:04] our life
[3:06:05] because it's not up to us to implement
[3:06:07] it it is not up to us to put it to work
[3:06:11] it is not up to us to bring it to pass
[3:06:14] all that you are requiring from us is
[3:06:17] what you require for Mary is just to
[3:06:20] obey and to accept it and to say be unto
[3:06:25] me just like Peter could say at that
[3:06:27] word may each one of us surrender
[3:06:31] ourselves
[3:06:33] and let the will of God so that the
[3:06:36] stroke
[3:06:38] will be easy so that the Yoke won't be a
[3:06:42] burden so that the moving won't be a lot
[3:06:45] of sweating so that whatever we're doing
[3:06:47] it won't take a lot of hustle and person
