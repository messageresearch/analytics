[0:02] [Music]
[0:12] oh
[0:20] all
[0:21] things
[0:27] [Music]
[0:45] lord
[0:49] [Music]
[1:01] [Music]
[1:13] i
[1:14] believe
[1:16] [Music]
[1:27] oh
[1:32] [Music]
[1:40] one more time jesus is here
[1:47] [Music]
[1:53] [Applause]
[1:56] [Music]
[2:08] jesus
[2:12] [Music]
[2:17] jesus
[2:24] [Music]
[2:48] amen
[2:49] you believe it this morning
[2:51] let's give the lord a clap offering
[2:58] that'll be all for the music god richly
[3:00] bless you musician
[3:04] you might be seated a little bit so i go
[3:06] through these announcements
[3:10] you know my first question right
[3:12] how many are up to date with the sermon
[3:15] let me see your hand
[3:17] okay okay okay when i'm gonna pick up a
[3:21] second speed you won't be able to catch
[3:23] me up
[3:25] when i will begin to get fried sunday
[3:28] wednesday sunday wednesday you're gonna
[3:29] stay far behind so i'm going slowly
[3:33] so you can catch up and everything
[3:35] should be good amen how many are reading
[3:38] the cod book and the church ages okay
[3:42] okay i am not responsible
[3:45] the trustees told me that uh
[3:48] they will prefer to have the building
[3:50] fund next sunday so it gives somebody
[3:53] more time to kind of prepare for
[3:55] building fund i don't know if somebody
[3:56] else was already prepared but
[3:59] what the trustee told me so if you can
[4:01] hold on to it unless you have it you
[4:03] want to give it to the trustee that's
[4:04] between you and the trustee you can
[4:06] handle it but if somebody was not
[4:08] prepared you again have one more week to
[4:11] go over it amen
[4:13] you continue to pray for the saint in
[4:15] ukraine for what is going on they're
[4:18] right in the middle of the situation
[4:20] they were not prepared
[4:21] and they're not even uh
[4:24] author of the sea of the situation
[4:26] they're just victims of what is going on
[4:28] amen
[4:29] so i didn't want to
[4:31] ask the church to do another offering
[4:34] because we already have our building
[4:36] fund and we still have a lot on our
[4:38] plate to do so what i did i took an
[4:41] offering myself
[4:43] on behalf of the entire church because
[4:45] brother berry has been communicating
[4:47] with me keeping me
[4:49] updated and i was looking at the
[4:51] situation before i can respond so since
[4:54] we got all the green lights that
[4:55] everything is set up where money can be
[4:59] transferred all the way and reach the
[5:01] scent over there i took an offering on
[5:03] behalf of the entire church
[5:05] and i send it through the channel of
[5:07] brotherberry coffee so it can be given
[5:10] to the saint in ukraine amen so we can
[5:12] just help the church move on because we
[5:14] have a lot on our plate everybody clear
[5:16] so far but continue to pray for them
[5:19] amen
[5:20] our sisters meeting went wonderful
[5:23] yesterday
[5:24] they can tell you
[5:26] [Laughter]
[5:30] [Applause]
[5:31] some people wanted to be there but i was
[5:34] trying to be careful i believe you
[5:36] already understood my point
[5:39] there are certain questions that usually
[5:41] brought abraham handled them between the
[5:43] pastors and their congregation and some
[5:46] of those questions came through that
[5:48] meeting so
[5:49] if somebody
[5:51] is not part of this church i don't want
[5:53] to load you up with a lot of stuff
[5:55] and before you know it a pastor is in
[5:58] trouble somewhere because somebody is
[6:00] shooting a lot of scripture amen
[6:02] i remember one time there was a brother
[6:04] who called me say i was a i have a
[6:07] document where i have subject and then i
[6:09] put quotes of brother branham and the
[6:11] brother was asking me to give him the
[6:13] quote that document and i asked the
[6:15] brother i say what are you going to do
[6:17] with it he said well there is a church
[6:19] that is in trouble somewhere else so i
[6:21] was looking for that document and i can
[6:24] give to the brothers over there i say i
[6:26] cannot give it to you that document
[6:28] because if i give it to you i know the
[6:31] courts that are loaded there all it
[6:34] takes is somebody without wisdom and
[6:36] he's going to shoot on the pastor pretty
[6:38] bad amen
[6:40] so the quote and the message are not
[6:42] meant for that amen
[6:43] so when the motive and objective are
[6:45] wrong i am not going to give you
[6:47] scripture and quote to get into a fight
[6:50] or disrespect a local shepherd somewhere
[6:53] so to avoid all those kind of stuff
[6:56] because the subject was very deep we
[6:59] ended up even there i'm sorry i forgot a
[7:01] wonderful coach yesterday so on the next
[7:04] meeting for the sister just remind me
[7:06] i'm going to give you the quote we had
[7:07] to start it from genesis and way down
[7:11] following with birth control
[7:13] so they know now more than you think so
[7:16] you young man
[7:17] those sisters got nuclear weapon
[7:20] [Laughter]
[7:22] amen so you need to be careful make sure
[7:25] you load yourself very good because we
[7:28] went all the way from genesis all the
[7:30] way and pulled it up with the scripture
[7:32] and the coat of brother branham so i
[7:34] didn't want to give all of that for
[7:36] somebody who's under a different
[7:37] wordship and maybe their pastor believes
[7:40] something different and before you know
[7:42] it it's scripture and a fight with a
[7:44] pastor so this is for spoken word it
[7:47] stays here if you hear then i can unload
[7:50] that to you amen
[7:52] oh my god don't get mad on me
[7:55] i have to follow what the deacon told me
[7:57] amen
[7:59] on march 19th we mentioned that we will
[8:01] have our house meeting
[8:04] up to this time i have zero question for
[8:07] the house meeting
[8:08] and march 19th is approaching and matter
[8:11] of fact we have a problem with the venue
[8:13] there was like
[8:15] either a problem with the date so what
[8:18] happened we had 55
[8:21] questions on the sisters meeting
[8:24] so the deacon asked me if we could use
[8:27] march 19
[8:29] for the second sister's meeting
[8:32] so at that point we don't rush with the
[8:34] question and brother chim opened his
[8:37] home
[8:38] for march 19th because the venue is
[8:41] already booked
[8:42] so the sister can have a second
[8:45] sister young adult meeting amen so march
[8:48] 19th we're not going to have a house
[8:50] meeting i don't have any question yet
[8:52] it's going to be the second sister's
[8:54] meeting so we can continue with their
[8:56] question they had like 55 we probably
[8:59] touch on maybe six yesterday
[9:01] nine okay nine by god's grade so nine is
[9:04] imperfect
[9:05] so we touch on nine so you know from 55
[9:08] minus nine you know what your pastors
[9:10] still have to deal with amen so we're
[9:13] going to give them one more opportunity
[9:15] and see how quick we can go with those
[9:17] questions i don't want to rush with them
[9:18] because they're important from some for
[9:20] somebody and we want to make sure they
[9:22] know exactly what they're talking about
[9:24] amen
[9:25] so march 19th it's not a house meeting
[9:28] you can still bring your question but
[9:30] march 19th is going to be the young
[9:32] sisters meeting again and the address
[9:35] will be text to you i cannot give the
[9:37] address on youtube amen but our next
[9:40] house meeting will be on april 9th
[9:44] so you have almost a month
[9:46] to give me questions and put to put them
[9:49] in a box so april now some people have a
[9:51] hard time with the job to prepare so now
[9:54] you know one month ahead if you want to
[9:57] be there you can prepare for april 9th
[10:00] any question so far
[10:03] is somebody happy
[10:05] or somebody's mad
[10:08] i gave you the date
[10:10] it's up to you to fix your schedule and
[10:13] to be there if you're not there i am not
[10:15] responsible i cannot go to your
[10:18] job or get you to your home and put you
[10:20] in the car to bring you into a meeting
[10:22] amen and we're now recording them so
[10:24] when they answer they're gone it's gone
[10:27] amen if you ask me about it i'll tell
[10:29] you you missed that meeting
[10:33] praise the lord
[10:34] amen
[10:36] one more or cup this one i can't handle
[10:39] it here couple announcements brother
[10:41] charles grandfather was released from
[10:43] the hospital after the announcement was
[10:45] given here and the church prayed for it
[10:47] so he was released from the hospital we
[10:49] want to thank the lord for that one
[10:53] [Applause]
[10:55] he's probably streaming because they
[10:57] travel all the way there to be with uh
[11:00] with the family and see him so by god's
[11:02] grace we praise the lord everything is
[11:04] doing good so he want me to mention this
[11:07] to the church you saw the landscaping
[11:10] work that was done on the church outside
[11:13] how he looks beautiful
[11:15] and the man that did it did it beyond
[11:18] what he we he was supposed to do
[11:20] he was supposed to do a certain work not
[11:23] put the trees and everything but he
[11:25] asked for the plan we gave it to him and
[11:28] he did all of that so we call him to
[11:30] make sure the trustee contacted him to
[11:32] make sure we don't owe him any money
[11:34] because he did everything beyond what he
[11:37] was supposed to do he did everything for
[11:40] free
[11:42] [Applause]
[11:49] amen
[11:50] so we save some money so we can work on
[11:52] the equipment body david the internet is
[11:54] okay now
[11:56] okay you will see maybe three times the
[11:59] title uh shoot on youtube because we
[12:02] were struggling with the internet so you
[12:04] pray so everything will be fine i know
[12:06] what the devil is fighting me with
[12:08] exactly what's going on so we will try
[12:12] probably to delete the two first link so
[12:15] you can keep one more amen
[12:17] now let's go straight to our scripture
[12:24] okay okay matthew chapter
[12:27] 13.
[12:37] i'm sorry mama
[12:39] we just had to keep the young sisters
[12:41] only
[12:43] so don't get mad on me
[12:46] if you want to know about what we talk
[12:48] about in detail
[12:50] you organize your own meeting so i can
[12:52] sit down with you
[12:54] and i can unload that for you
[12:57] from genesis all the way where we were
[13:00] there was a young girl that asked me a
[13:02] question so when are we going to have
[13:04] our young young sisters meeting
[13:08] say what is going on no so we had
[13:11] questions about why did the lord came up
[13:13] to paul
[13:14] i say okay okay those are interesting
[13:17] questions
[13:18] but if i have that meeting their parents
[13:20] must be there
[13:21] but don't
[13:24] shock them
[13:25] from asking questions
[13:30] let's go to matthew chapter 13.
[13:33] oh my god
[13:36] if you dare you can say amen
[13:39] verse 15.
[13:44] for these people's heart just a little
[13:46] bit brother david
[13:48] is wax gross
[13:50] in other words the heart is dull
[13:53] unresponsive
[13:55] and the ears are dull of hearing
[13:59] and their eyes
[14:00] they have closed
[14:03] why lest at any time
[14:06] they should see
[14:08] with the eyes
[14:10] you might be seated
[14:11] and here
[14:12] with their ears
[14:18] those eyes are not the natural eyes
[14:21] because they could see christ
[14:23] those ears are not in this one
[14:28] amen
[14:29] that's a different ear
[14:32] god
[14:33] help us
[14:36] and heal with the ears and should
[14:38] understand with their
[14:40] heart not this understanding is not in
[14:43] your brain
[14:45] it's an understanding from the heart
[14:47] amen
[14:49] understand with their heart
[14:51] and should be water
[14:54] so
[14:55] to be converted
[15:01] to be converted
[15:04] according to the scripture
[15:06] you must go through all of this
[15:08] amen
[15:10] you must hear
[15:11] with your hear
[15:13] amen
[15:14] you must hear
[15:17] you must see
[15:20] and you must understand
[15:23] not with your head but you must
[15:26] understand with your heart
[15:29] and then you are converted
[15:32] don't sleep on me today
[15:35] amen
[15:36] and i should heal them
[15:39] so this healing here
[15:41] is not a healing of somebody that is
[15:43] sick
[15:45] physically you remember last sunday we
[15:48] found out that the sickest body of
[15:50] that we know of is the church and that
[15:52] sickest body needs a spiritual healing
[15:56] everybody remember
[16:02] let's go to mark chapter 4.
[16:17] mark chapter 4 verse 12.
[16:20] we're still dealing with ruth
[16:25] if you're there you can say amen
[16:28] that seeing
[16:29] they may see
[16:31] and not perceive
[16:33] the word is understand
[16:35] so you're looking at something but you
[16:36] don't understand it
[16:38] while it's all around you
[16:41] and hearing
[16:42] they may hear and not understand
[16:46] so now understanding is with the seeing
[16:48] and the hearing
[16:50] everybody clear
[16:52] lest at any time
[16:53] they should be converted
[16:56] and they're water
[16:58] so conversion
[17:01] is now related to sin
[17:10] and their sins
[17:12] should be forgiven them
[17:15] now we're looking at conversion and sin
[17:19] being forgiven
[17:23] everybody care
[17:26] let's go to luke chapter 22. these are
[17:28] very short short
[17:30] so we can jump quickly and run
[17:34] luke
[17:36] chapter 22 verse
[17:39] 31 if you dare
[17:41] you can say amen
[17:49] if you still mad at me you need to
[17:51] repent
[17:57] it's called sister's meeting
[18:00] he was not married meeting
[18:02] or outside meeting or in a national
[18:05] meeting
[18:07] your sister's meeting so chill out get
[18:10] the devil off of you
[18:14] okay
[18:17] gee luke chapter 22
[18:24] and the lord
[18:25] i cannot trust anybody
[18:28] i don't want to give somebody something
[18:30] here and it's on you so it's in uh in
[18:32] australia
[18:34] you give somebody something and it's in
[18:36] south america
[18:38] because this one takes somebody this one
[18:40] takes this one this one takes this one
[18:41] and it's all over
[18:43] amen
[18:44] verse 31 and the lord says salmon
[18:48] salmon this is peter
[18:50] behold satan has desire to have you that
[18:54] he may sift you as wheat
[18:58] what a desire
[19:00] but
[19:01] i have prayed for you
[19:06] jesus when you were praying for someone
[19:08] where were you praying for
[19:10] what were you praying about
[19:12] i have prayed for you that's your water
[19:16] so someone had faith
[19:18] [Music]
[19:21] peter
[19:23] or salmon
[19:27] had faith
[19:30] before pentecost
[19:33] amen
[19:35] amen
[19:37] am i reading a different bible
[19:39] before peter received the holy ghost
[19:45] am i okay
[19:49] before peter received the holy ghost
[19:53] peter already had faith
[19:58] i'm gonna try to help you this holy
[20:00] ghost is tough my friend
[20:02] amen
[20:04] before peter got filled with the holy
[20:08] spirit he already got faith
[20:11] and jesus prayed
[20:14] that the faith that peter already had
[20:21] amen
[20:22] amen you will know if you have the holy
[20:25] ghost or not
[20:27] but i have prayed for you that your
[20:30] faith fell not
[20:32] so this faith peter already have it
[20:36] but you can lose it
[20:40] amen
[20:41] amen are you awake
[20:44] i thought when you have faith everything
[20:46] is finished
[20:52] now peter already have faith
[20:54] peter knew who jesus christ was
[20:57] peter could tell you i know this is the
[21:00] messiah the son of the living god
[21:03] but he could fail
[21:07] with that faith
[21:09] who
[21:10] got the holy ghost
[21:11] and that faith was before the baptism
[21:15] of the holy spirit
[21:18] amen when do you get the holy ghost
[21:20] there
[21:25] hallelujah amen but i have prayed for
[21:28] you that your faith fell if not
[21:31] everybody okay
[21:34] and
[21:35] you okay
[21:37] and
[21:38] when you are water
[21:42] so peter had the faith without
[21:45] conversion
[21:49] amen
[21:50] amen when these things are not taught
[21:53] well in the message this is why we have
[21:55] a confusion
[21:57] we don't know if we have the holy ghost
[21:59] or not
[22:01] and i told you i cannot preach this in
[22:02] one sermon i have to go step by step now
[22:06] you understand the tabernacle the three
[22:08] step now you understand roof as i'm
[22:10] going down it's going to unfold more
[22:14] and the more detail you have the more
[22:16] precise
[22:19] you know now
[22:21] when you want to operate or do surgery
[22:23] on somebody you need to have a lot of
[22:26] detail on anatomy
[22:28] because when you're cutting stuff you
[22:30] cannot be brutal
[22:32] you need to cut stuff according to the
[22:34] anatomy because you don't want to cut an
[22:37] artery or cut a nerve and cause trouble
[22:41] so surgery is a precise
[22:44] science
[22:48] lack of precision oh you're getting this
[22:50] message you got the holy ghost
[22:57] how can you have the holy ghost you
[22:59] preach the message and relieve the
[23:00] message
[23:00] [Music]
[23:05] where you are
[23:07] did you hear the holy ghost
[23:11] peter here
[23:12] [Music]
[23:13] already preached the gospel
[23:18] can i continue
[23:20] this peter preached the gospel
[23:23] this peter healed the sick
[23:27] amen
[23:28] everybody okay
[23:30] these people walk in water on water
[23:36] everybody okay
[23:38] this peter came back rejoicing
[23:41] and jesus said your name is written in
[23:44] the book of life
[23:48] everybody okay
[23:49] this peter he had a lot of miracle
[23:52] that happened with him no holy ghost
[24:00] he preached jesus christ
[24:03] he healed the secret and the people look
[24:05] at the peter they say peter is filled
[24:07] with the holy ghost zero holy ghost
[24:10] all he had by doing all of this is just
[24:13] faith
[24:17] if preachers understand this
[24:20] they will stop preaching and go back and
[24:23] sit down
[24:24] and search for the holy ghost
[24:26] and we won't have shocked with preachers
[24:29] when you sit around the preacher you
[24:31] begin to talk you look at him you wonder
[24:34] if that's the man that was preaching
[24:36] over there
[24:37] he's as bad as a people on the street
[24:41] a racist preacher
[24:43] prejudice preacher a liar sleeping with
[24:47] women lying doing all kinds of stuff and
[24:50] preaching the gospel preaching the
[24:52] message of brother branham
[24:57] [Music]
[25:01] did all of this
[25:03] faith
[25:04] no holy ghost
[25:06] who has the holy ghost
[25:12] and when you are converted so this faith
[25:16] is different than conversion
[25:21] i thought conversion is forgiveness of
[25:23] sin
[25:24] lord jesus christ forgive me my sin and
[25:26] this and this and this and this okay and
[25:29] then i'm converted that's what i thought
[25:31] but now you say converted is different
[25:33] than this
[25:36] different than conversion
[25:39] peter head fifth
[25:40] he was not converted yet
[25:43] i thought when you have faith you are
[25:45] converted
[25:48] let me pull those denominational staff
[25:50] away
[25:53] and when you are converted strengthen

[27:43] on the four
[27:44] phases of roof
[27:46] justification
[27:50] we talk about the four phases of roof
[27:52] grace
[27:54] the four phases of roof the tabernacle
[27:57] the four phases of roof at the brazen
[27:59] altar
[28:00] now we are the four phases of roof
[28:03] justification
[28:06] brother branham says this that i'm
[28:08] afraid today
[28:11] that too many of us
[28:13] are not getting people to christ
[28:21] we are getting them to a church
[28:27] getting them to a church means they are
[28:29] in the camp
[28:31] like roof was in the camp
[28:35] in the house of elimelech
[28:38] everybody here
[28:40] but roof was not converted
[28:42] yet amen she have not even taken a
[28:45] decision yet
[28:47] brother branham said we are getting them
[28:49] to a church
[28:51] to a theory
[28:53] but we must get them to christ
[28:57] he's the only one
[28:59] and the only one that has life
[29:03] this christ here is not a book
[29:06] amen
[29:08] amen
[29:09] amen this christ here is not a letter on
[29:13] the paper
[29:15] this christ here is a persona
[29:21] [Laughter]
[29:23] he that has the son
[29:25] has life
[29:26] and if the life of a man that is dead be
[29:30] projected in you you will live the same
[29:33] life he lived
[29:35] if you have let out for jesus christ in
[29:37] you
[29:38] why are you not living like jesus christ
[29:41] and you're trying to convince me that
[29:43] you got the life of jesus christ
[29:45] anybody okay
[29:47] when we talk about roof at the present
[29:49] altar or the mystery of the brazen altar
[29:53] we found out that brother branham says
[29:55] this let me quote this and then we go
[29:59] he said your priest
[30:02] your leader
[30:04] and so forth
[30:06] can teach you your religion
[30:11] the word
[30:12] that i'm pulling them is teach
[30:16] everybody okay
[30:17] you can learn the message
[30:25] learning is not bad
[30:27] it depends on where you're learning
[30:30] everybody okay
[30:32] he said you can learn the message
[30:35] that we are trying to teach
[30:39] you can learn it
[30:41] you can put it in your head
[30:43] you can argue with everybody on the
[30:46] facebook
[30:48] you can call all the message young
[30:50] people to charming because you want to
[30:52] start a discussion
[30:57] but still that won't give you eternal
[30:59] life
[31:04] how many people have eternal life
[31:09] you get to accept the person
[31:14] jesus christ
[31:16] you understand that all of you
[31:19] got to accept the person
[31:21] jesus christ to have eternal life
[31:25] now but sometimes
[31:27] other leadership
[31:30] gets so much influence on us
[31:34] until we don't know what to do
[31:37] when that times comes
[31:41] you love your pastor so much
[31:45] you love preachers so and so so much
[31:49] as soon as you leave this church quickly
[31:51] you on the website to watch your
[31:52] preferred preacher
[31:57] and when the
[31:59] very christ is coming you don't even
[32:01] know how to handle him
[32:06] when we talk about the tabernacle
[32:09] we found that the tabernacle have a gate
[32:13] that you must enter
[32:15] when you want to bring people in this
[32:18] message
[32:19] you need to know the appropriate gate
[32:27] everybody here
[32:29] if you bring them through marriage wrong
[32:31] gate
[32:34] if you bring them because they are
[32:36] friends wrong gate
[32:39] if you bring them because they were born
[32:42] in this message wrong gate
[32:45] because on those gates they can learn
[32:49] the message
[32:52] because that's the church they attend
[32:55] that's where the parents were going to
[32:57] church
[32:57] so they'll learn the message they can
[33:00] tell you about the seventh year they can
[33:02] tell you about this and this but they
[33:04] were not born again
[33:09] when you look in the tabernacle there is
[33:12] a gate
[33:13] and this gate in exodus 27 i'm just
[33:16] reminding you
[33:18] the bible said that for the gate of the
[33:20] court
[33:22] shall be a hanging of 20 cubit
[33:26] of blue
[33:28] and purple
[33:29] and scarlet you remember this now and
[33:32] fantuan lenin in other words when you go
[33:35] in the tabernacle
[33:37] the gate was not different than the door
[33:42] i hope you're staying with this sermon
[33:46] everybody okay
[33:49] here we got the court the other court
[33:53] if you are clicking quick we can move
[33:55] faster
[33:57] but now i'm seeing somebody's forgetting
[33:59] stuff quickly
[34:00] the holy place
[34:02] and here we have the
[34:04] holiest these places were separated by
[34:08] curtain
[34:09] anybody okay
[34:10] the first curtain here
[34:12] is what they call the gate
[34:15] the second curtain here is what they
[34:17] call the door
[34:19] and the third curtain here is what they
[34:22] call the veil
[34:24] this curtain was the same thing as this
[34:26] curtain
[34:28] and it was the same thing as this
[34:29] curtain
[34:30] the only difference was the last curtain
[34:33] have caribeams
[34:35] you remember
[34:37] and we know that when the veil was
[34:40] ranked
[34:41] paul told us that that veil was the
[34:44] flesh of jesus christ
[34:47] the one who's on the internet make sure
[34:49] you pull this up everybody okay
[34:51] so this veil was jesus christ
[34:56] this door was jesus christ
[34:59] because he said i am the door and this
[35:02] gate also is jesus christ
[35:09] and back here and when you enter this
[35:12] gate the first thing you see is the and
[35:15] altar
[35:16] everybody here so when you are bringing
[35:19] somebody in the message
[35:23] do you follow me
[35:25] and you are pulling the gate to that
[35:27] person
[35:29] make sure when you get up and up they
[35:32] see the present altar
[35:35] amen
[35:38] [Music]
[35:40] somebody is smoking
[35:42] somebody's drinking
[35:45] somebody's sleeping prostitute on the
[35:47] street
[35:49] you want to talk to her about the seven
[35:51] seal
[35:55] you want to talk to them about the feast
[35:57] of the trumpet
[36:00] you are using the wrong gate
[36:03] they need to repent first
[36:07] hallelujah
[36:09] the bible says that that gate was blue
[36:13] it was purple he was scared and he had
[36:16] fine-tuned learning hey mark here and
[36:19] that gate also
[36:21] had four
[36:24] pillars four
[36:26] the number of the earth
[36:28] the number of
[36:30] deliveries
[36:31] you have four pillars
[36:34] everybody okay
[36:35] and therefore socket
[36:38] the bible says in matthew 7
[36:40] enter ye in the straight gate
[36:47] because we have the brazen altar here
[36:52] and what follow the brazen altar
[36:55] what was in the level
[36:59] everybody okay
[37:00] he said enter in
[37:03] the straight gate
[37:05] for why this degate
[37:07] and broad is the way
[37:09] that leadeth to destruction
[37:14] the easy way destruction
[37:16] and many
[37:20] many people
[37:23] there
[37:24] be which god indirectly
[37:27] so this gate is not popular
[37:32] amen
[37:33] it is a gate that is presented to the
[37:36] elect only amen
[37:40] everybody okay so far
[37:42] and
[37:43] matthew continued he said because
[37:45] strength is the gate
[37:48] if you notice that straight
[37:51] is not straight
[37:56] are you following me
[37:58] if you're sleeping that's your problem
[38:00] this threat is like this
[38:06] it is not this
[38:13] okay
[38:15] it is not this one
[38:18] and usually when we say straight is a
[38:20] gate we thought that was this
[38:23] oh the gate is straight or straight
[38:25] straight that is wrong
[38:29] it is not straight like this it is
[38:32] s-t-r-a-i-t
[38:38] he said straight is the gate
[38:41] and narrow is the way
[38:44] ever clear
[38:46] so this gate is also a way
[38:53] because roof stowed on the way going
[38:56] back to judah
[38:58] anybody okay now
[39:00] he said straight is the gate and narrow
[39:04] is the way
[39:05] and jesus said i am the way
[39:08] everybody
[39:09] which lead it unto water
[39:12] so this gate here
[39:14] when you meet it it's not really life
[39:17] yet
[39:21] amen
[39:23] amen
[39:24] are we okay
[39:26] it is a gate that opened
[39:28] to lead you into life
[39:32] [Music]
[39:35] hallelujah
[39:37] and few it is not popular
[39:40] whether the congregation and the
[39:42] preacher feel
[39:44] few dare be defunded
[39:48] brother brother help me decode this
[39:52] how is the gate
[39:54] the gate his water
[39:57] everybody here
[39:58] jesus said shrek is the gate
[40:01] he was talking about himself
[40:03] because the gate was the way and jesus
[40:06] said i am the way i am the truth and i
[40:09] am water
[40:11] is that right
[40:13] what i'm saying
[40:14] how is it spell
[40:17] s-t
[40:19] r-a-i-t everybody here
[40:22] or this one it is not this one brother
[40:25] branham said that
[40:27] s-t-r-a-i-t
[40:28] means water
[40:33] in other words warner is the gate
[40:40] everybody clear it's a gate when you
[40:43] open up
[40:44] somehow down the road you must meet
[40:46] water
[40:55] he said where is the gate
[40:57] how do you come in by water
[41:00] repent you are in the present altar
[41:03] every one of you and be water you are in
[41:06] the level
[41:10] so this gate when he opened up he have
[41:14] to present to you the present altar
[41:17] and after the present hotel it will
[41:20] present to you deliver
[41:22] the present altar for your repentance
[41:27] and the water for your baptism
[41:31] everybody here
[41:32] and we baptize in the name of jesus
[41:35] christ unlocks the water
[41:38] and that gate has four pillars
[41:43] the bible says in the book of revelation
[41:46] chapter 3
[41:47] that him that overcometh
[41:50] will i make a pillar
[41:55] so a pillar
[41:57] is also a person
[42:02] the bible says in the book of proverbs
[42:05] that wisdom has built herself a house
[42:09] and wisdom is sitting upon how many
[42:12] pillars
[42:13] seven pillars
[42:17] here
[42:18] so the wisdom of god have seven person
[42:25] and if you take those seven persons
[42:28] and you put them together you have the
[42:31] entire wisdom of god
[42:35] everybody okay
[42:36] because throughout the seven churches
[42:38] jesus
[42:39] we have seven messengers
[42:42] and every messenger has an angel that he
[42:45] was working with him
[42:47] but in this end time we found seven
[42:50] angels
[42:52] meeting together and bringing the head
[42:54] of jesus christ
[42:56] which is the wisdom of god
[43:00] [Music]
[43:04] everybody okay
[43:06] the bible says overcometh will i make a
[43:09] pillar in the temple of my god and he
[43:12] shall go no more out
[43:14] [Music]
[43:16] there is a lot with this pillar let me
[43:18] continue
[43:19] and i will write upon him
[43:22] that pillar that person the name of my
[43:25] god
[43:27] who's the name of god
[43:29] you remember the uh the road of aaron
[43:32] yes sir you have to put the name of
[43:34] aaron the high priest on
[43:36] you remember and the name of the city of
[43:39] my god
[43:41] which is the new jerusalem which cometh
[43:43] down out of heaven from water
[43:46] so we understand here that a pillar can
[43:49] be a person
[43:52] and this gate was held by four pillars
[43:59] it's a gate that is held by four people
[44:04] and we know that jesus have to have
[44:06] disciples
[44:09] and among those 12 disciples one of them
[44:13] was called matthew
[44:16] one of them was called mark
[44:19] one of them was called luke and one of
[44:22] them was called john
[44:24] and those four people wrote the gospel
[44:28] of jesus christ carrying the life of
[44:31] jesus christ in the four gospel
[44:34] so when you meet somebody who's coming
[44:36] in the message you must preach to him
[44:39] the gospel first
[44:44] [Music]
[44:47] everybody okay so far let's go to roman
[44:50] one
[44:56] the message is the gospel
[44:59] but you gotta know what you're bringing
[45:01] from the message
[45:03] you don't meet somebody drinking beer
[45:04] and you say the seven seal was revealed
[45:12] anybody here
[45:15] you tell him that at the opening of the
[45:17] sixth seal
[45:23] everybody clear let's go to roman
[45:25] chapter one
[45:27] this gate have blue fellowship
[45:31] scarlet you know what it means
[45:33] fine learning the righteousness of
[45:34] descent hey
[45:37] let's go to uh
[45:38] verse
[45:40] 15
[45:42] so as much as in me is this is paul
[45:46] i'm ready to preach water
[45:49] the gospel to you that are at room
[45:53] also
[45:54] for i am not ashamed
[45:57] of the gospel of who
[46:00] for it is the water
[46:04] everybody okay this is what you pull
[46:06] into somebody it is the power of god to
[46:10] water
[46:11] this gate first
[46:13] for salvation
[46:16] because the person needs to be born
[46:18] again
[46:20] anybody here
[46:22] it is the power of god to salvation to
[46:25] everyone that do whatever believe to the
[46:28] jew first and also to the greek
[46:32] for their in in the gospel
[46:35] everybody here
[46:36] is the water
[46:38] the fine linen
[46:40] anybody okay in the gospel is the
[46:44] foreign language
[46:45] the righteousness of god water
[46:48] revealed from water
[46:52] so you must go from faith to water
[46:59] you okay now
[47:00] it's revealed from first from fifth to
[47:04] fifth as it is written they just shall
[47:07] live by what
[47:08] so the judge shall live by faith is the
[47:11] message of who
[47:14] which is called justification and
[47:16] justification was your other code
[47:23] everybody okay so when you bring in
[47:25] somebody you must know which gate
[47:27] they're coming in
[47:29] when you open the gate they must first
[47:32] get into the present altar
[47:36] and after the president alter you bring
[47:38] them to the world of baptism
[47:40] before you move forward with them
[47:44] hallelujah
[47:46] now brother branham says this
[47:49] we talk about teaching and learning
[47:51] brother branham says this again
[47:54] brother obama said i believe the church
[47:58] is beginning
[48:02] to hear the message
[48:05] what were they hearing
[48:09] what were they hearing
[48:11] amen
[48:12] and begin to do water
[48:15] so somebody was hearing but they were
[48:17] not understanding
[48:20] amen
[48:21] but friend listen we get to lay in the
[48:25] presence of the sun
[48:27] we got to be ripened
[48:29] everybody okay
[48:30] our water
[48:32] is not water
[48:34] let me go back again our water
[48:38] is not water
[48:41] our water
[48:43] is not yet
[48:49] to rap you must enter in the presence of
[48:53] the sun
[48:55] the presence of the sun is where the
[48:58] pillar of fire is
[49:00] your faith here
[49:02] is still green
[49:04] [Music]
[49:06] did you follow me
[49:08] that faith need to go all the way there
[49:10] and rape
[49:13] [Music]
[49:16] amen
[49:17] amen lord have mercy
[49:20] intellectually
[49:24] do you hear me
[49:26] we are hearing the water
[49:33] how did you hear the message
[49:37] from your heart
[49:39] or from your head
[49:41] intellectually we are hearing the
[49:43] message
[49:44] that's why you try to impress people
[49:48] you're sitting and you say yes i
[49:49] remember when we were talking about the
[49:51] tabernacle and think things tomorrow
[49:53] you're a liar

[50:08] intellectually
[50:12] intellectually we are hearing the
[50:14] message that god has given us
[50:17] and seeing the sounds that he showed us
[50:19] and prove it by the bible it's there but
[50:23] oh how the church need to lay in the
[50:26] presence till it does what
[50:29] you know and get what
[50:31] in the spirit so it can be water
[50:37] so
[50:38] teaching is not a problem
[50:41] learning is not a problem
[50:43] where do you learn
[50:45] and where do you get your
[50:47] understanding from this is what a
[50:50] problem is brother branham says this
[50:54] hallelujah
[50:56] brother branham says this he said he
[50:59] taught us the evidence of what would
[51:02] happen after being baptized with the
[51:04] holy ghost
[51:06] was that we would have the water
[51:09] come and teach all water
[51:14] but that teacher was an inside teacher
[51:22] okay
[51:23] on the other court you are exposed to
[51:26] the zodiac
[51:31] you are outside
[51:32] if it rains rain over there
[51:35] if he snow is not over there
[51:38] but the teacher is insane
[51:46] who is teaching you the message
[51:49] is the preacher teaching you the message
[51:53] of the holy ghost teaching you the
[51:55] message
[52:00] hallelujah
[52:02] nothing outside teacher
[52:05] if the spirit was not inside you would
[52:08] not hear the truth
[52:13] and receive it by water
[52:16] if you heard it every moment of the day
[52:20] 20 years in the message and leave the
[52:22] message he was not hearing the message
[52:27] intellectually he was receiving the
[52:29] message
[52:30] ever
[52:32] that was the son of the indwelling
[52:35] spirit in the days of power those who
[52:38] were filled with the water
[52:40] heard the word
[52:42] receive it and did what
[52:44] they never stop at the hearing
[52:47] the words that they receive become flesh
[52:52] [Music]
[52:56] brother stephen preach about
[52:58] where your skirt should be
[53:00] why is your skirt all the time here in
[53:02] church
[53:04] you're not hearing
[53:07] it's intellectually that you're
[53:08] receiving it
[53:10] all your skirts are right here
[53:12] every sister is here all your skirts are
[53:15] here and you're the only one
[53:20] hallelujah
[53:22] the brother branham said those who did
[53:24] not have the spirit
[53:26] they also heard it
[53:28] only as water
[53:30] intellectual and put water
[53:34] a wrong interpretation on it and went on
[53:37] water i didn't think brother stephen
[53:39] meant to that
[53:42] brother stephen meant what he preached
[53:47] it is your interpretation because of the
[53:50] lack of the holy ghost
[53:53] but here in every age of the holy ghost
[53:56] in every age and every age is the edge
[53:59] of the holy ghost for the true believer
[54:01] i say in every age the evidence was the
[54:04] same
[54:05] those who had the spirit the teacher
[54:08] heard the word and that spirit in them
[54:11] took the word
[54:12] and taught it
[54:15] in other words reveal it to them and
[54:18] they were of the group that heard the
[54:20] messenger
[54:22] and his message and took it and did what
[54:26] if you left that messenger of your day
[54:30] how are you hearing the message
[54:34] we gave too many people the holy ghost
[54:36] in this message
[54:41] because we have our own conception of
[54:43] the holy ghost
[54:45] everybody cares so far
[54:46] so as we begin to move on
[54:49] last sunday we found that we we stopped
[54:53] here in uh in the story of elijah
[54:56] and we know that israel was between two
[54:59] opinions
[55:00] the bible says that elijah came unto all
[55:03] the people and say how long
[55:07] hat you
[55:08] between two opinion
[55:10] if the lord be god
[55:12] follow him but if bear then follow him
[55:15] in other words somebody must make a
[55:17] decision
[55:19] either the message is right
[55:21] stick with the message if the message is
[55:24] wrong don't waste your time here
[55:29] [Music]
[55:31] this is not a church i'm going to pet
[55:33] you to stay here
[55:35] for your traveling
[55:36] you're in the wrong church
[55:38] i'm rocking you off so we can go to
[55:40] reverend
[55:43] everybody
[55:44] we're not looking for tithing here
[55:47] i'm working my friend
[55:51] everybody okay
[55:54] anybody okay
[55:55] either follow god or go to the way of
[55:58] bell and we found out that elijah
[56:01] restored the altar according to the
[56:04] president
[56:06] and according to the levin
[56:08] in other words elijah restored the altar
[56:12] according to the other court
[56:15] [Music]
[56:21] when israel was between two opinions
[56:24] when israel was not sure whether the
[56:27] message is right or not
[56:29] elijah brought the other culture
[56:32] [Music]
[56:33] [Applause]
[56:35] ever here i cannot waste my time with
[56:38] the holy place i cannot waste my time
[56:40] with the holy of holies what you need to
[56:43] go through is the other code
[56:48] because you gotta make a decision
[56:51] either you're going for god are you
[56:53] going for bear either you're gonna go
[56:55] for this world and cope with everything
[56:58] that goes into the world
[57:02] the world cut their hair a certain way
[57:05] you do it too
[57:07] they change you change they change you
[57:09] change who is giving you your
[57:11] information
[57:14] have you ever seen me changing my beard
[57:18] because i don't care what is on the
[57:19] outside
[57:20] i'm not waiting for them to change the
[57:22] view then i change mine
[57:24] and then tomorrow when the change has
[57:26] changed also i am on the outside
[57:32] you have a certain way you cut your hair
[57:35] stick to it
[57:36] i understand women have to change a
[57:38] little bit but do not copy after the
[57:41] world
[57:42] all the things of the world because if
[57:45] you love the world and the things of the
[57:47] world the love of god is not even in you
[57:57] fool yourself
[57:59] and know what the bible say
[58:01] people act like we don't know what the
[58:02] scriptures say
[58:05] are you have the holy ghost that's your
[58:06] own holy ghost not the one i know here
[58:11] you can fool yourself not me
[58:13] everybody okay so far so elijah pulled
[58:16] the other coat
[58:17] and he brought the two elements
[58:20] he brought the altar and he brought the
[58:22] level and when elijah prayed then the
[58:25] fire came down
[58:30] right here
[58:32] elijah brought to israel
[58:35] at 2 38
[58:40] because only
[58:42] when the fire fell
[58:45] than the heart
[58:46] of israel
[58:50] when the fire fell
[58:52] than the heart of israel
[58:58] when the fire fell
[59:00] then the heart of israel
[59:02] was turned back to god
[59:07] everybody okay
[59:08] everybody okay
[59:10] so right here repent
[59:14] be baptized
[59:16] and then you shall receive the gift of
[59:19] the holy ghost
[59:20] act 2 38
[59:22] presented by elijah to israel you got to
[59:26] come that way first
[59:27] before we enter into the deep of holy
[59:29] stuff
[59:31] here at the time of the evening
[59:34] sacrifice
[59:36] that's why you look at brother brother
[59:37] at the beginning he was preaching about
[59:40] healing and salvation healing and the
[59:42] holy ghost because what branham was
[59:44] presenting to people the other caught
[59:47] first before the opening of the seals
[59:50] down the road
[59:53] [Applause]
[59:57] brother didn't preach the seals in 47
[1:00:00] he went away down there
[1:00:03] because the people need to grow up
[1:00:06] he was featured he was dealing with
[1:00:08] pentecostal babies
[1:00:15] the fire the bible said i indeed
[1:00:18] baptize you with water
[1:00:20] until repentance but he that cometh
[1:00:23] after me is mightier than i whose you
[1:00:26] i'm not worthy to bear we already talk
[1:00:28] about that shoe
[1:00:29] he shall baptize you with the holy ghost
[1:00:32] and water
[1:00:34] it seems to hear
[1:00:35] like the holy ghost is different than
[1:00:38] the fire
[1:00:43] because
[1:00:45] matthew put a camera
[1:00:48] in luke the bible says
[1:00:50] john answered luke is a teacher
[1:00:53] saying unto them i indeed baptize you
[1:00:56] with water but one mario deny
[1:01:00] i come
[1:01:01] the largest of whose shoes i'm not
[1:01:03] worthy to lose he shall baptize you with
[1:01:06] the water
[1:01:07] luke didn't put the camera but he said
[1:01:10] the holy ghost said what
[1:01:12] luke put them together
[1:01:17] everybody okay
[1:01:19] now in act
[1:01:21] let's see what happened
[1:01:23] enough to do the bible says
[1:01:25] and suddenly there came a son from
[1:01:28] heaven
[1:01:29] as a rushing mighty wind
[1:01:32] and he filled out the house where they
[1:01:33] were sitting and then in the upper room
[1:01:37] appear unto them cloventon like of water
[1:01:42] and he sat upon each one of them
[1:01:45] and they were all filled with water
[1:01:48] so we found out here that when the holy
[1:01:51] ghost comes he comes with fire
[1:01:58] you got the holy ghost
[1:01:59] where is your fire
[1:02:03] oh i gathered without sensation
[1:02:09] mary got a pregnancy with her sensation
[1:02:13] but after a while we could see her
[1:02:14] barely going up
[1:02:17] your belly don't go up
[1:02:18] you didn't have a baby
[1:02:23] anybody here
[1:02:24] and they were all filled with the holy
[1:02:26] spirit and began to speak with other
[1:02:29] tongues as the spirit gave them
[1:02:31] utterance in other words the holy ghost
[1:02:33] sent the fire i won
[1:02:37] hallelujah brother problem say you have
[1:02:40] to watch the word fire
[1:02:43] because the holy ghost is used the holy
[1:02:45] ghost and fire because the holy ghost
[1:02:48] fire does what
[1:02:51] because that snake must be burnt out
[1:02:54] in justification the snake is there
[1:02:59] sanctification the snake is there that's
[1:03:02] why judah could move all the way here
[1:03:04] but when you get here
[1:03:07] the pillar of fire and the snake don't
[1:03:10] get along
[1:03:10] [Applause]
[1:03:12] the black dog and the white dog they
[1:03:15] don't get along
[1:03:17] [Applause]
[1:03:18] the light and the darkness don't get
[1:03:21] along when the light comes automatically
[1:03:24] the darkness have to go away
[1:03:26] [Music]
[1:03:28] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:03:31] science justify man
[1:03:34] salvation he justify man sanctify him
[1:03:37] send the holy ghost and fire and burn
[1:03:40] the sin
[1:03:41] out of him and dwelling him himself
[1:03:45] that is always god's judgment
[1:03:49] when he makes his final judgment
[1:03:56] there is a
[1:03:57] present altar here
[1:03:58] everybody okay
[1:04:00] there is a judgment here
[1:04:02] you remember
[1:04:04] but this judgment is not final
[1:04:09] there is a final judgment
[1:04:12] the final judgment to determine who is
[1:04:15] chosen by god
[1:04:17] is right here
[1:04:21] if you put your road there and your road
[1:04:24] come without anything you are not chosen
[1:04:27] the final judgment is in the holy place
[1:04:30] the holiest
[1:04:33] amen hallelujah amen
[1:04:36] that is always god's judgment when he
[1:04:39] makes his final judgment he calls you
[1:04:43] justify you and bring you to redemption
[1:04:47] anybody okay
[1:04:49] so you can get justified here but god
[1:04:51] have not given you his final judgment
[1:04:54] yet
[1:04:55] whether he agrees with you or not
[1:04:58] anybody here
[1:05:00] and then
[1:05:01] his judgment breaks forth upon you
[1:05:05] so you must reach a point after your
[1:05:08] justification
[1:05:10] that god comes
[1:05:12] with a judgment on you
[1:05:16] hallelujah
[1:05:18] and the holy water
[1:05:21] ghost and fire the water
[1:05:24] cleans away the sin then you are water
[1:05:27] so the final judgment have to put you on
[1:05:31] the holiest
[1:05:33] then god say this belongs to me
[1:05:38] relax
[1:05:39] amen
[1:05:41] what is going on
[1:05:43] when you go into the tabernacle
[1:05:48] hallelujah when you enter the other
[1:05:51] court
[1:05:52] we have two furniture there
[1:05:56] we got the altar
[1:05:58] and we got the lever
[1:05:59] as soon as you finish those two process
[1:06:02] then you finish with the other coat
[1:06:05] my friend on the uh computer make sure
[1:06:08] he stays there everybody okay
[1:06:10] then you have the second stage over
[1:06:13] there which is the holy place
[1:06:16] when you cross the holy place then you
[1:06:18] go to the holy stone over there
[1:06:21] everybody okay
[1:06:22] and right here in the other court at the
[1:06:25] present until we repent
[1:06:28] everybody okay i'm
[1:06:31] then going slowly
[1:06:31] lava we get our world of baptism
[1:06:35] everybody okay
[1:06:36] then later on you get the gift of the
[1:06:39] holy spirit
[1:06:41] this is act again 2 38
[1:06:44] in the tabernacle
[1:06:47] at 238 in the tabernacle when you get in
[1:06:51] repent
[1:06:52] be baptized in the name of jesus christ
[1:06:54] and you shall receive the gift of the
[1:06:56] holy spirit
[1:06:58] the problem is this
[1:07:01] in between the other cut
[1:07:04] and the holy place there is a space
[1:07:06] there
[1:07:11] we have a measurement somewhere that is
[1:07:14] missing
[1:07:15] everybody okay so when we look at act 2
[1:07:18] 38 act is saying repent
[1:07:22] we got the first furniture act is saying
[1:07:25] that uh be baptized we got the second
[1:07:27] furniture then suddenly act of act 2 38
[1:07:31] goes to the baptism of the holy spirit
[1:07:34] which make which jumpers all together to
[1:07:36] the holiest
[1:07:38] now we got a problem how where is the
[1:07:40] holy place
[1:07:42] into act 238
[1:07:46] if you notice between the other court
[1:07:50] and the holiest blessing everybody clear
[1:07:53] there is a space of time that separates
[1:07:57] the two
[1:07:59] everybody okay
[1:08:00] that suffers of time in acts 2 38 is
[1:08:05] called shall
[1:08:12] everybody okay
[1:08:13] did i lose anybody
[1:08:17] did i lose anybody
[1:08:18] in other words repent
[1:08:21] be baptized in the name of jesus christ
[1:08:24] you will have a period of time
[1:08:28] of preparation
[1:08:32] shall the space of time
[1:08:36] receive the gift of the holy spirit
[1:08:42] did i lose anybody
[1:08:44] act 2 38 is there
[1:08:46] and brother branham said the other court
[1:08:49] was justification
[1:08:52] the holy place was sanctification
[1:08:56] and the holiest was the baptism of the
[1:08:58] holy spirit
[1:09:01] and according to ruth
[1:09:03] justification was what
[1:09:06] brother branham said he is called the
[1:09:09] church through justification
[1:09:12] call it through sanctification then fill
[1:09:15] it with the water
[1:09:16] and water
[1:09:18] he took it through a process
[1:09:23] this journey here from here all the way
[1:09:27] here is a process
[1:09:32] oh i gave my life to jesus christ i'm a
[1:09:35] christian
[1:09:40] you christian
[1:09:41] you don't listen to your parent
[1:09:44] you're still stubborn
[1:09:45] the bible say obey children obey your
[1:09:47] parents
[1:09:48] or you say i'm 18 i do anything i want
[1:09:50] to do so get out from the home
[1:09:57] you can't pay the bills
[1:09:59] get out from the home
[1:10:01] go pay your own bills
[1:10:05] you know you a team when you want to
[1:10:07] talk but you don't want to be 18 in
[1:10:10] paying the rent
[1:10:11] you don't want to be 18 in paying your
[1:10:13] car you don't want to be patient in
[1:10:15] paying your insurance
[1:10:18] when he comes to pay and show us mama
[1:10:20] when he comes to pay your rent to daddy
[1:10:23] when you come to pentecost you are broke
[1:10:26] but when he come to tell you what to do
[1:10:28] you are 18.
[1:10:33] be 18 in every play
[1:10:36] [Applause]
[1:10:38] take your own responsibility and be 18
[1:10:42] years old
[1:10:44] [Music]
[1:10:45] you can't fix your bed you're 18.
[1:10:56] you're working a whole year
[1:10:58] they gave you your w-2 form you're not
[1:11:01] paying any a lot of bills in the home
[1:11:03] where did your money go
[1:11:06] you should be rich
[1:11:09] four years
[1:11:10] working you should be rich where did
[1:11:12] your money go 18 years old
[1:11:14] you know practically basically you know
[1:11:17] what i'm saying you said you see you
[1:11:19] follow me
[1:11:27] when you talk like this talk also with
[1:11:30] your pocket
[1:11:39] do you love me
[1:11:41] jesus loves me
[1:11:43] even if you don't love me
[1:11:45] [Applause]
[1:11:49] hallelujah he said that himself the holy
[1:11:53] spirit himself the son of god could
[1:11:55] dwell in human heart
[1:11:58] so the process is for god to come and
[1:12:01] dwell in you
[1:12:02] now he has to go through that
[1:12:07] before he can come in
[1:12:10] in other words god will never fill you
[1:12:13] with the holy ghost
[1:12:15] until you are cleaned up properly
[1:12:18] oh i speak in tongues i don't care
[1:12:21] [Music]
[1:12:25] pentecost are speaking tongues
[1:12:27] and they're dressing like devils
[1:12:32] lesbians speak in tongues
[1:12:34] how much sex you speak in tongues
[1:12:39] what can you prove them
[1:12:41] that can change them
[1:12:45] i'm fasting 10 days
[1:12:47] or you open up dogs for devils
[1:12:52] that's fine
[1:12:53] everybody okay so we found justification
[1:12:57] sanctification baptism of the holy ghost
[1:13:00] is a process
[1:13:02] and according to ruth justification is
[1:13:05] roof deciding
[1:13:09] sanctification is roof serving
[1:13:12] the baptism of the holy ghost is roof
[1:13:14] resting
[1:13:16] everybody okay now roof left from the
[1:13:20] house of elimination
[1:13:22] from the camp and roof move on into her
[1:13:25] justification
[1:13:27] she got straight to the gate
[1:13:30] on the way going to judah and now we
[1:13:32] have roof ready
[1:13:34] roof
[1:13:35] and justification
[1:13:37] this is our sermon today
[1:13:39] ruth enter
[1:13:41] she have to meet the president
[1:13:44] to make a decision
[1:13:47] and to repent
[1:13:50] what is repentance
[1:13:55] we found last sunday that a that isaiah
[1:13:58] got into the temple and he recognized
[1:14:01] and acknowledged that he was a sinner
[1:14:03] what is to repent
[1:14:07] the brother branham say
[1:14:09] now what can we do if we want to receive
[1:14:12] this
[1:14:14] repent peter say
[1:14:17] brother branham say what is repent
[1:14:23] repent
[1:14:25] means to turn around
[1:14:29] in other words you are going toward the
[1:14:31] staff
[1:14:33] if you truly repented you cannot be on
[1:14:37] 85 staff anymore
[1:14:39] you got to be on 85 enough
[1:14:43] if you still going on 95 self
[1:14:47] you are fooling yourself
[1:14:52] what is repentance
[1:14:54] brother random say you was going with
[1:14:57] the world
[1:14:58] turn around and go up toward god
[1:15:01] now you are looking down this way
[1:15:04] look up this way
[1:15:05] repent run along with a big long face
[1:15:09] like this oh where bless god i have been
[1:15:12] in church for 40 years in a message
[1:15:15] then repent look up this way and say
[1:15:17] hallelujah there it is that is what you
[1:15:20] want to do to turn around
[1:15:23] to look what
[1:15:25] why do you still look the same
[1:15:30] hallelujah that is what you should do
[1:15:33] brother branham said the trouble of it
[1:15:36] you want to shake hand
[1:15:38] and sprinkle instead of repent and be
[1:15:41] baptized
[1:15:44] repent means turn around
[1:15:47] leave your belief behind
[1:15:51] start up on the road believing god
[1:15:55] toward water
[1:15:57] you are approaching the present altar
[1:15:59] now because you got to be killed
[1:16:05] this is not thought that's why you come
[1:16:07] to the altar don't change come to the
[1:16:08] altar don't change
[1:16:10] but here
[1:16:11] turn around start up the road and you
[1:16:14] will receive the baptism of the holy
[1:16:17] ghost you shall receive it's in the
[1:16:20] future remember the spacing
[1:16:22] brother problem continues he said and
[1:16:25] that is the reason i do use the word
[1:16:27] baptism in the name of jesus christ
[1:16:30] but not regeneration
[1:16:32] the pentecostal united pentecostal
[1:16:34] church baptized in the name of jesus
[1:16:36] christ for regeneration in other words
[1:16:39] the pentecostal are saying when they
[1:16:42] baptize you in water then you got your
[1:16:44] new birth
[1:16:46] brother brandon said that's wrong
[1:16:49] your new birth is over here
[1:16:51] i'm going with the pentecostal off
[1:16:54] everybody okay
[1:16:55] i don't believe that they can do that if
[1:16:58] they want to
[1:16:59] but i believe that peter said repent
[1:17:02] first
[1:17:04] water don't remit sin
[1:17:06] the church of christ preaches that way
[1:17:08] but i believe that repentance
[1:17:11] godly sorrow we already talk about this
[1:17:13] you don't come in the altar laughing the
[1:17:16] lamb doesn't go in the altar laughing
[1:17:18] and telling his friend hello goodbye and
[1:17:20] they're going to kill him he's going to
[1:17:22] the altered trembling
[1:17:24] everybody here
[1:17:26] repent means turn around
[1:17:29] go back
[1:17:30] you did what
[1:17:32] you missed the mark
[1:17:34] you must start over i was born in a
[1:17:37] message yes you must start over
[1:17:51] because your knowledge of servant self
[1:17:53] didn't take the sin of your
[1:17:56] life so you were intellectually
[1:17:59] receiving this hills everybody
[1:18:01] do that first
[1:18:03] and your baptism in order is only an
[1:18:06] honored profession of something that has
[1:18:09] been done inside that you have accepted
[1:18:12] christ as your water
[1:18:14] so when you approach
[1:18:16] the gate the proper way according to
[1:18:19] brother branham when ruth approaches
[1:18:21] here there is a repractis
[1:18:24] and repentance will follow with death
[1:18:32] everybody here
[1:18:33] a death of what
[1:18:36] the bible says
[1:18:37] i am crucified with christ
[1:18:42] this is paul
[1:18:44] christ was already crucified but you
[1:18:47] must be crucified now with christ
[1:18:52] you must die
[1:18:54] jesus christ
[1:18:56] nevertheless i live
[1:18:59] yet no time but christ lives within me
[1:19:03] because paul is dead
[1:19:04] and the life we can now live in the
[1:19:07] flesh
[1:19:08] that has the black dog i live it by the
[1:19:11] faith
[1:19:13] of the son of god who loved me and gave
[1:19:17] himself for me
[1:19:19] knowing this that our old man
[1:19:22] is what
[1:19:24] do you see what i'm saying
[1:19:25] crucify with him
[1:19:27] that the body of sin might be destroyed
[1:19:30] that henceforth we should not serve sin
[1:19:33] anymore
[1:19:35] and they that are christ have done what
[1:19:39] they flesh with the water
[1:19:41] and water
[1:19:45] but god forbid that i should glory
[1:19:49] save in the water
[1:19:51] of the lord jesus christ by whom the
[1:19:54] water
[1:19:55] the world is water
[1:19:57] and unto the water
[1:19:59] so when you entering into the other coat
[1:20:03] when you get to the president you are
[1:20:05] dying to the world
[1:20:08] you cannot move forward with the world
[1:20:12] your repentance is wrong
[1:20:14] you must go back again
[1:20:16] i'm going slowly everybody clear so far
[1:20:20] everybody clear so far
[1:20:21] let me pull this i don't know why this
[1:20:24] is playing games
[1:20:25] let's go to roof chapter one
[1:20:30] hallelujah how
[1:20:33] when you die at the altar what happened
[1:20:36] to you what is that death mean
[1:20:40] everybody here
[1:20:42] blessed be the name of the lord for
[1:20:44] those that are wondering about time my
[1:20:46] time is okay
[1:20:48] so chill out
[1:20:53] here
[1:20:54] before you know it somebody's up
[1:21:00] the beginning
[1:21:03] not your pastor
[1:21:05] amen
[1:21:10] roof chapter one you there
[1:21:13] let's go to verse 14.
[1:21:16] and they lift up their voice
[1:21:18] we are roof in justification
[1:21:22] everybody
[1:21:23] there is two aspects of justification
[1:21:25] there is justification of a person
[1:21:28] that's what i'm preaching today
[1:21:30] then we're going to get the
[1:21:30] justification of the age
[1:21:35] you don't put them together
[1:21:37] you mess out the coach together and you
[1:21:39] get confused i'm going with a person and
[1:21:42] with the age and you're going to get in
[1:21:43] the message and every coach you see you
[1:21:45] will travel like a fish in the water
[1:21:47] without any problem
[1:21:49] hey
[1:21:50] luke chapter 1 verse 14
[1:21:52] and they lift up their voice roof and
[1:21:54] oppa and wept again
[1:21:57] remember this you already know and oppa
[1:22:00] kissed her mother-in-law
[1:22:02] but
[1:22:03] roof did water
[1:22:05] crank her
[1:22:08] and she said this is naomi
[1:22:10] behold your sister-in-law is gone back
[1:22:13] to her water
[1:22:16] so when orpah was going back
[1:22:19] oppa was not going back in the house
[1:22:21] that elimelech was living
[1:22:28] makes sense
[1:22:29] she was actually going back to the world
[1:22:32] when the people gave their back to the
[1:22:34] message
[1:22:36] don't be surprised
[1:22:38] if you begin to see them in paint
[1:22:41] wearing makeups and all kind of stuff
[1:22:43] because they think they are going back
[1:22:45] to the camp they are not they are going
[1:22:48] back to the origin
[1:22:57] she's going back to her people
[1:23:00] the more about back to the nomination
[1:23:03] and to her what
[1:23:06] god's object of worship
[1:23:10] brother branham say everything you put
[1:23:12] between you and god is a nado
[1:23:19] brother brother say your church can
[1:23:20] become an adult
[1:23:25] brother branham say a gift can become an
[1:23:27] adult
[1:23:28] and brother branham said they took the
[1:23:30] brazen serpent
[1:23:32] and they made it an adult
[1:23:35] here but i have a news for you
[1:23:38] even though the brazen serpent that
[1:23:41] moses lift up was made an arrow
[1:23:44] that didn't make moses a false prophet
[1:23:48] [Music]
[1:23:55] did you hear me
[1:23:57] did you hear me
[1:23:58] moses made the present serpent and the
[1:24:02] people begin to worship him but that
[1:24:04] didn't make moses a false prophet
[1:24:07] moses was still the prophet of god
[1:24:11] if somebody worship brother branham
[1:24:14] that is wrong
[1:24:16] but that doesn't make brother branham a
[1:24:18] wrong prophet brother brother is still a
[1:24:21] vindicator prophet of god
[1:24:27] [Music]
[1:24:27] [Applause]
[1:24:31] you don't play with this message
[1:24:34] hallelujah
[1:24:35] hallelujah
[1:24:37] return to your god after your
[1:24:39] sister-in-law she loved the things of

[1:30:53] [Music]
[1:30:54] something is missing
[1:30:56] right
[1:30:58] something is missing
[1:31:00] remember she's going in which land
[1:31:06] the land of judah
[1:31:09] the land of judah had a mystery
[1:31:15] everybody okay
[1:31:16] and that mystery started with abraham
[1:31:22] everybody here
[1:31:24] and the one who really started it was
[1:31:27] job
[1:31:29] [Music]
[1:31:32] are you following me
[1:31:33] job went through his trial
[1:31:36] and at the summit of his trial job
[1:31:40] looked up and the vision broke up and
[1:31:44] john job said
[1:31:46] wow
[1:31:47] i know
[1:31:52] my redeemer
[1:31:55] job was in the time of nimrod
[1:31:57] before abraham but he saw the redeemer
[1:32:01] job said i know my redeemer lives
[1:32:06] and i will see him in the last day
[1:32:09] dawg the skin worm destroy this body
[1:32:14] yet me job
[1:32:16] in the same flesh
[1:32:18] i will rise again
[1:32:20] and i will see my redeemer
[1:32:22] so job
[1:32:24] spoke about the resurrection
[1:32:29] and he died
[1:32:31] and they took him and they bury him
[1:32:33] somewhere
[1:32:36] everybody okay
[1:32:38] abraham came
[1:32:41] back here
[1:32:42] and for some reason
[1:32:44] sarah died
[1:32:47] abraham looked
[1:32:48] and there was a portion of the land that
[1:32:51] attracted abraham
[1:32:53] abraham say i need to get that place
[1:32:55] over there
[1:33:01] that mystery only a prophet can unfold
[1:33:05] to you
[1:33:06] brother branham say what abraham was
[1:33:09] looking
[1:33:10] was the place where job was buried
[1:33:19] everybody here
[1:33:20] so abraham got that place
[1:33:23] and he said sarah i'm gonna bury you
[1:33:26] with this man here
[1:33:30] are you okay
[1:33:32] later on the whole land
[1:33:35] became the land of judah
[1:33:37] everybody okay
[1:33:39] so when jacob left him and went to egypt
[1:33:46] and said john in egypt
[1:33:48] before the death of jacob he said call
[1:33:51] me joseph
[1:33:53] joseph come here
[1:33:55] if i die
[1:33:57] don't bury me in egypt
[1:34:02] take my but take my casket
[1:34:05] back to the promised land
[1:34:07] go where abraham was buried
[1:34:10] god put me there
[1:34:15] everybody okay
[1:34:16] and joseph grew up
[1:34:18] and before he died
[1:34:21] joseph called it
[1:34:23] the brother he said come here come here
[1:34:26] listen to me i am dead i'm a prophet i'm
[1:34:29] gonna die actually when i'm die
[1:34:32] okay
[1:34:33] momentarily you keep me here because you
[1:34:37] gotta watch over my bone
[1:34:39] okay i was a great man they're not gonna
[1:34:42] let me they're not gonna let you pick me
[1:34:44] up because they want to keep me here
[1:34:46] before everything i did for egypt but
[1:34:49] there will come a day
[1:34:50] that god will send you somebody
[1:34:53] the lord will visit you and will take
[1:34:56] you out of here
[1:34:57] at that time
[1:34:59] there won't be a pharaoh that would
[1:35:01] neglect me
[1:35:03] he won't carry a bat he won't worry
[1:35:04] about my casket anymore
[1:35:07] he won't know the value of the prophet
[1:35:09] anymore
[1:35:10] at that time when you go out
[1:35:13] remember me
[1:35:17] ever here go back to pharaoh's tomb
[1:35:20] take my casket out
[1:35:24] if you're sleeping you can stand up back
[1:35:25] there take your cash casket out
[1:35:28] and take me to the promised land and
[1:35:31] bury me there
[1:35:33] why are these people
[1:35:35] want to be buried in the promised land
[1:35:40] everybody what happened is when the veil
[1:35:44] was split
[1:35:47] and jesus screamed
[1:35:49] everybody
[1:35:50] that was a scent that was buried in
[1:35:53] paradise
[1:35:54] resurrected
[1:35:58] everybody here so when roof is saying
[1:36:01] where you die
[1:36:04] i'm gonna die there
[1:36:07] and i'm gonna be buried there roof also
[1:36:11] identified with abraham
[1:36:14] with jacob
[1:36:15] with job
[1:36:16] with joseph
[1:36:18] [Music]
[1:36:21] ever here when you bury me then
[1:36:24] ruth knew that i won't be resurrected
[1:36:32] rule for meeting the resurrection
[1:36:35] because it's a mystery
[1:36:37] where you die
[1:36:39] i will be there i will die when you bury
[1:36:42] i will be buried
[1:36:44] because the resurrection will be there
[1:36:47] the death
[1:36:49] the burial and the resurrection is all
[1:36:52] symbolized by the water baptism
[1:36:58] roof at the level
[1:37:04] did i lose somebody
[1:37:06] so right here
[1:37:08] roof at the present altar
[1:37:14] and ruth at the alt at the at the
[1:37:18] delivery
[1:37:22] where you go i go your people will be my
[1:37:25] people your god will be my god
[1:37:28] in other words wolf was
[1:37:30] separating herself
[1:37:32] completely with her country of origin
[1:37:37] or her country of natural birth
[1:37:44] i wish i have time
[1:37:46] sometimes you have to separate from
[1:37:50] everything that is dear on earth
[1:37:53] she's going to leave her father
[1:37:55] she's going to leave her mother she's
[1:37:57] going to leave her uncle she's going to
[1:37:59] leave everything like abraham did
[1:38:02] and she's going alone
[1:38:06] not a family member abraham pick up a
[1:38:08] lot she didn't pick nobody
[1:38:11] everybody
[1:38:12] everything that is there on earth to you
[1:38:15] to take your position that god has
[1:38:18] called you to
[1:38:20] it will cost you something my friend
[1:38:24] this altar is not a game
[1:38:27] it's going to cost you your friends
[1:38:29] he will even cost you some message
[1:38:31] believer
[1:38:34] because you don't want to cope with them
[1:38:35] anymore
[1:38:36] because you realize they were not a good
[1:38:39] influence you hang out with them a lot
[1:38:41] you don't progress
[1:38:43] ever here
[1:38:45] i am sure you can read between the line
[1:38:47] what i'm saying
[1:38:49] sometimes the very dearest person on
[1:38:51] earth
[1:38:52] you have to shake hand with them
[1:38:54] and take your position in christ to
[1:38:56] where god has called you
[1:38:58] but what is god doing here
[1:39:01] he's transforming you
[1:39:03] remember the tabernacle from what you
[1:39:06] will's
[1:39:07] roof
[1:39:08] may be a daughter or a son or whatever
[1:39:11] it is from a lovely family sometime roof
[1:39:15] he places you somewhere else roof
[1:39:18] because it is his way of doing it
[1:39:21] by renewing off your water
[1:39:24] to obey the word regardless of what the
[1:39:28] price is
[1:39:31] do you see what repentance is

[1:39:54] forth and have all kind of fancy stuff
[1:39:56] and like some kind of freeze-up birds
[1:39:59] but now she's changed
[1:40:01] she made the decision to go with god now
[1:40:04] she comes into a people that does not
[1:40:07] believe that kind of stuff
[1:40:09] she's a stranger she gets to work as a
[1:40:12] program she doesn't know their custom
[1:40:15] they are all strange to her she don't
[1:40:17] know what to do that's what roof had to

[1:40:22] what i have to do myself
[1:40:26] where are you going brother stephen when
[1:40:28] i accepted christ i was turned out of my
[1:40:32] home

[1:41:21] decision you gotta take your choice
[1:41:24] [Music]
[1:41:26] ruth say
[1:41:27] that my your people
[1:41:29] will be my people
[1:41:30] what is wrong with that one brother
[1:41:33] branham saying
[1:41:34] why don't the christian women wear those
[1:41:37] clothes like the other women do
[1:41:40] say we are all american are we
[1:41:44] i say no sir
[1:41:49] because when you are born
[1:41:51] when you are at the brazen otter you
[1:41:54] must reject your country of origin
[1:42:08] if you coming from africa you gotta live
[1:42:11] the behavior of africans
[1:42:18] you gotta die to africa
[1:42:21] you gotta die to europe
[1:42:23] you gotta die to america
[1:42:26] you gotta die from your country
[1:42:28] of origin
[1:42:34] why do you still behave the way you
[1:42:36] behave
[1:42:39] god said be on time in church
[1:42:43] a strain from your country are late
[1:42:47] you need to be dead to that
[1:42:49] [Music]
[1:42:54] what are we i said we are neither german
[1:42:59] nor water
[1:43:00] nor what
[1:43:02] no what
[1:43:03] no what
[1:43:04] oh what
[1:43:06] we are none of them
[1:43:10] this church
[1:43:12] is not an american church
[1:43:14] this church is not an african church
[1:43:17] this church is not a european church
[1:43:20] this church is the church of the living
[1:43:22] god
[1:43:27] a church on the merchandise deck
[1:43:30] from every country every tribe every
[1:43:34] language
[1:43:39] so don't push your way here
[1:43:41] you gotta die to your way
[1:43:45] we have one head
[1:43:47] that's the message of the hour
[1:43:53] what are we
[1:43:55] i say we are christian
[1:43:57] why american act like american
[1:44:01] german act like water
[1:44:04] because that is the water
[1:44:06] but we have a national spirit that is
[1:44:09] the water
[1:44:11] coming from water
[1:44:13] out of water and you act like water
[1:44:16] make you conduct yourself as they do up
[1:44:20] because you are of another
[1:44:23] [Applause]
[1:44:26] your people
[1:44:28] will be my people
[1:44:29] that people is not african
[1:44:32] that people is not american that people
[1:44:35] is not latino that people is not
[1:44:37] european they're not canadian they are
[1:44:40] christian
[1:44:45] hallelujah
[1:44:47] where you say honey
[1:44:49] you see each nation leave off on the
[1:44:51] spirit of the nation that's their
[1:44:53] national spirit she said well would it
[1:44:56] not be
[1:44:58] wouldn't we be living on the american
[1:45:00] spirit i say oh no we are born again we
[1:45:04] live on heavenly spirit where
[1:45:07] and what
[1:45:09] we are not american as far as that goes
[1:45:13] because american is just a nerfly nation
[1:45:16] and every nation sooner is going to be
[1:45:18] destroyed every kingdom there is a stone
[1:45:22] that came out of the mountain without
[1:45:24] the help of any hand it's going to
[1:45:26] destroy every kingdom
[1:45:28] and that's the kingdom that's going to
[1:45:30] stay forever
[1:45:33] hallelujah
[1:45:34] but when a man of german a man of sweden
[1:45:38] or wherever he may be when he become
[1:45:41] born of heaven he takes on the heavenly
[1:45:44] spirit
[1:45:45] his nature his makeup
[1:45:48] look for the principle where christ set
[1:45:51] at the right hand of god
[1:45:53] how we ought to remember that
[1:45:55] that he died that we might be able to be
[1:45:58] fortified from this thing inoculated
[1:46:02] that is right
[1:46:03] [Music]
[1:46:05] what is your behavior
[1:46:10] are you behaving like a christian or are
[1:46:12] you behaving like an american are you
[1:46:14] behaving like a christian or are you
[1:46:16] behaving like an african are you
[1:46:19] behaving like a christian or are you
[1:46:21] behaving like a european because there
[1:46:23] is only one message but that message
[1:46:26] goes to every country
[1:46:28] the same message i'm reading here people
[1:46:30] are reading that in south america
[1:46:32] they're reading that in canada in canada
[1:46:35] they're reading that in europe it's not
[1:46:37] a different message they just change the
[1:46:39] language but they keep the message the
[1:46:41] same
[1:46:44] so that if i meet a brother from russia
[1:46:47] a brother from ukraine if we sit
[1:46:49] together we can eat and talk and
[1:46:51] fellowship like we've seen each other
[1:46:53] for a long time
[1:46:56] [Music]
[1:46:58] but here
[1:46:59] anybody care
[1:47:01] what is converted
[1:47:04] you okay
[1:47:06] this thing is loaded buddy
[1:47:10] we talk about
[1:47:11] someone peter
[1:47:13] having faith
[1:47:14] but that faith without conversion
[1:47:17] conversion is a tricky word
[1:47:20] and you need to be understood right
[1:47:23] brother uh uh in psalm 51 david say
[1:47:27] then will that teach transgressor that
[1:47:30] way
[1:47:31] they need to teach them and sinner shall
[1:47:34] be converted unto thee
[1:47:38] many times we came from pentecost
[1:47:40] and we were taught that conversion means
[1:47:42] when you go to the altar you sit down
[1:47:45] you ask for forgiveness you wake up and
[1:47:47] you say you will hear them saying i'm
[1:47:49] converted i'm a christian now
[1:47:51] that's not correct
[1:47:53] because peter have faith
[1:47:55] but jesus told him when you are
[1:47:57] converted
[1:47:59] so he was not converted yet
[1:48:01] even though he could do all of this
[1:48:04] and pentecostal when they reach here
[1:48:06] they do this
[1:48:07] they can live any kind of life as long
[1:48:10] as the anointing is going on then they
[1:48:12] fell under the anointing one at the end
[1:48:14] time
[1:48:17] even in this message we have
[1:48:23] anyway
[1:48:24] matthew 18
[1:48:26] verily i say unto you
[1:48:28] except he be converted and become as
[1:48:31] leader children
[1:48:33] now converted
[1:48:35] you have to become like a child
[1:48:43] how many were converted
[1:48:44] today you still adult
[1:48:49] you do what you want to do
[1:48:51] regardless
[1:48:54] anybody care
[1:48:55] you shall not enter in the kingdom of
[1:48:57] heaven
[1:48:58] repent ye therefore and be what
[1:49:03] i thought to repent and converted into
[1:49:04] the same thing now
[1:49:06] now the bible said repent therefore
[1:49:08] karma
[1:49:10] and be what
[1:49:13] everybody here that your sin
[1:49:16] may be blooded out when the time of what
[1:49:20] you need to understand what is
[1:49:22] refreshing
[1:49:23] [Music]
[1:49:25] in isaiah 28 the bible says with
[1:49:28] stammering lips
[1:49:33] with strangling lips and another tongue
[1:49:36] you unders you see that speaking in
[1:49:39] tongues either stammering
[1:49:42] speaking in tongue another one will
[1:49:44] speak like a language
[1:49:46] the two of them
[1:49:48] with stammering lips and another tongue
[1:49:50] with us speak to these people to whom he
[1:49:53] said this is the what but we know the
[1:49:56] rest is where
[1:50:01] everybody okay
[1:50:03] rest
[1:50:04] when we may cause the weary to do what
[1:50:08] and this is the word
[1:50:11] so the refreshing is the holy ghost
[1:50:16] which brings the rest of god
[1:50:19] so when the holy ghost come
[1:50:21] you are completely off from the sin
[1:50:24] god get into your chair
[1:50:27] and get the palate of your life
[1:50:32] everybody here
[1:50:34] so be converted
[1:50:36] when when the time of refreshing when
[1:50:39] the holy ghost come
[1:50:43] oh brother branham
[1:50:45] come on in
[1:50:47] now we take the wrong in the word of
[1:50:50] conversion today
[1:50:51] we say that a man that is converted is a
[1:50:55] man that stopped drinking
[1:50:57] and everything and goes to church or
[1:51:00] joined the church
[1:51:02] he might join the church
[1:51:04] but that is no son he is what
[1:51:09] let that soak him
[1:51:11] he is not converted
[1:51:13] until his old life is what
[1:51:16] and his what
[1:51:19] and his what
[1:51:21] in the water
[1:51:23] of the newness of life when the water
[1:51:27] has created in him a living hope of
[1:51:31] eternal life which only come through the
[1:51:33] world
[1:51:37] peter
[1:51:39] peter
[1:51:41] not when you believe on me
[1:51:43] when you are converted
[1:51:45] when you're gonna go get the holy spirit
[1:51:48] that's when you can strengthen the
[1:51:50] brother
[1:51:51] not at this time because peter could
[1:51:53] cast
[1:51:56] she's making me so bad
[1:51:58] mad
[1:52:00] i'm so angry that if i don't control
[1:52:02] myself i can even speak bad things off
[1:52:04] my mouth
[1:52:05] you are not converted
[1:52:08] just that speech you are not converted
[1:52:10] don't fool yourself
[1:52:16] [Music]
[1:52:17] watch the language you're using
[1:52:19] it is showing you where you are
[1:52:26] everybody here
[1:52:27] he that believeth upon me
[1:52:30] now the scripture said that no man can
[1:52:33] say jesus is christ only by the water
[1:52:36] so you cannot believe that jesus is
[1:52:39] christ
[1:52:41] you can do it intellectually
[1:52:43] until
[1:52:44] you have received the baptism of the
[1:52:47] holy ghost
[1:52:48] you are only testifying or saying what
[1:52:52] the scripture says
[1:52:54] [Music]
[1:52:55] saying what the pastor says
[1:52:58] saying what mother say and some good
[1:53:01] preachers say but you don't know it
[1:53:04] yourself until he has witnessed his
[1:53:06] resurrection to you no man can call
[1:53:09] jesus the cross until by the water so
[1:53:12] when you say i believe jesus christ i
[1:53:14] believe jesus christ you're just
[1:53:15] repeating what you heard in church
[1:53:17] when you really believe in jesus christ
[1:53:21] peter say you are the christ the son of
[1:53:23] the living god
[1:53:25] and jesus looked at him he said when you
[1:53:27] gonna get converted
[1:53:34] sorry i gotta rock that boat i hate
[1:53:37] snakes
[1:53:41] i believe then
[1:53:43] now i believe then that a man is saved
[1:53:46] when he believes on the lord jesus
[1:53:48] christ with all his heart and from his
[1:53:51] heart not from the outside conscience
[1:54:02] put your seat belt because it's going to
[1:54:04] rock you bad
[1:54:06] now the next question
[1:54:08] is it true that you are not saved unless
[1:54:11] you receive the holy ghost
[1:54:15] you see why i have to preach the way i
[1:54:16] preach
[1:54:18] there could be about a good five hour
[1:54:23] i'm not gonna do that my battery was
[1:54:25] seven point something
[1:54:27] discussion on that
[1:54:31] when you accept christ
[1:54:33] as your savior and are then ready for
[1:54:37] baptism in order you will have not yet
[1:54:41] been converted
[1:54:42] you are only believing unto what
[1:54:53] everybody okay
[1:54:55] how many have the holy ghost
[1:54:58] conversion means to be
[1:55:04] hallelujah
[1:55:06] amen
[1:55:07] peter had been justified
[1:55:10] and believe on the lord jesus christ
[1:55:12] he even preached the gospel but jesus
[1:55:16] told him after you are converted then
[1:55:19] strengthen your brother after you are
[1:55:22] conversion conversion is the holy spirit
[1:55:26] that moves the old nature out
[1:55:30] the snake and the new nature
[1:55:33] the white dog comes in
[1:55:36] which is the holy ghost and when a man
[1:55:39] has truly born
[1:55:41] that has truly been born of the spirit
[1:55:43] of god he has everlasting life
[1:55:47] he that he with my word and believe on
[1:55:50] him that sent me not man can say it
[1:55:53] except by the water in other words that
[1:55:56] believing have to come from the holy
[1:55:58] ghost
[1:55:59] brother stephen i'm confused relax
[1:56:03] peter jesus told peter the night of the
[1:56:06] betrayal he was already what
[1:56:15] peter was water
[1:56:19] that's why jesus said i prayed for what
[1:56:27] this thing
[1:56:28] is a problem i let it soak
[1:56:32] but brother stephen he was already saved
[1:56:34] what else do we need
[1:56:37] relax
[1:56:39] he was already safe
[1:56:41] now after you are converted strengthen
[1:56:44] your water
[1:56:46] that's right you accept christ as your
[1:56:48] savior but when you are converted is
[1:56:51] when you are really changed
[1:56:54] that's right you have you was not
[1:56:56] changed yet
[1:56:57] he cursed
[1:56:59] before the lord
[1:57:03] save cursing
[1:57:06] snake still living in
[1:57:09] you understand now
[1:57:11] you understand why you acted the way you
[1:57:12] at why you clock the door or you snap
[1:57:16] the door to mama
[1:57:22] why you show people finger on the
[1:57:23] highway
[1:57:27] and you turn around you say i'm sorry
[1:57:29] lord but he already got it
[1:57:34] not converted
[1:57:36] have a snake in you
[1:57:40] he cursed before the lord and deny him
[1:57:43] and everything but after his conversion
[1:57:47] after that are converted strengthen the
[1:57:50] brother that is what the scripture says
[1:57:52] anyone
[1:57:54] that makes it right jesus told peter
[1:57:56] that he had followed him he cast out
[1:57:59] devils he done miracle and everything
[1:58:02] you are not converted yet
[1:58:04] but after you are converted then
[1:58:07] strengthen your breathing
[1:58:11] jesus christ
[1:58:13] what's going on
[1:58:14] do you believe that
[1:58:17] god give the holy spirit to everyone
[1:58:20] that is truly born again christian at
[1:58:22] the time they accept salvation
[1:58:25] or do you believe that this is a
[1:58:28] different work of grace that in that in
[1:58:31] the experience of most christians come
[1:58:33] later please clarify this subject as
[1:58:37] many are what
[1:58:39] because of the different water
[1:58:44] somebody saying
[1:58:46] when you are
[1:58:47] at the altar
[1:58:53] i have a question do we receive the holy
[1:58:56] spirit here
[1:58:57] or the holy spirit is separate from this
[1:59:00] one
[1:59:02] why because of the teaching
[1:59:08] you received the message you already
[1:59:09] received the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:59:12] sleeping with women on the hotel
[1:59:15] that holy ghost doesn't stop you it's
[1:59:17] enjoying sin
[1:59:23] that's not the holy ghost
[1:59:25] now christian friend a person cannot be
[1:59:28] born again until they have received the
[1:59:31] holy spirit
[1:59:33] you can
[1:59:34] you are not even converted
[1:59:37] until you received
[1:59:40] i am not saying you are lost
[1:59:47] i'm praying for you
[1:59:50] but when you are
[1:59:55] the message is perfectly aligned with
[1:59:58] the scripture
[2:00:01] relax
[2:00:03] if i let you go read this stuff you're
[2:00:05] going to be puzzled left and right you
[2:00:06] don't understand what you mean by the
[2:00:08] problem say here but what i'm saying
[2:00:09] it's a confusion and back here it is not
[2:00:12] a confusion i'm not saying you are lost
[2:00:15] before you receive the holy ghost
[2:00:17] because you are not
[2:00:18] there is three
[2:00:20] there is one work of grace
[2:00:23] only one work of grace that is the holy
[2:00:25] spirit and it's made in three
[2:00:28] manifestations
[2:00:29] just like there is one god made in three
[2:00:32] manifestation father son holy spirit one
[2:00:37] god only what
[2:00:39] there is the three works of grace but
[2:00:41] through manifestation there is a
[2:00:43] manifestation of justification by water
[2:00:47] brother branham is saying
[2:00:49] the tabernacle here
[2:00:51] is one
[2:00:55] tabernacle but he have three parts
[2:00:59] and back here
[2:01:01] all three parts belong to the tabernacle
[2:01:04] but to really make sure
[2:01:07] that
[2:01:08] you really are inside the tabernacle
[2:01:13] the final judgment
[2:01:15] comes with the
[2:01:17] last portion
[2:01:19] because people got here like judah
[2:01:23] people got here like judah
[2:01:26] ever here
[2:01:27] but when pentecost come they fell off
[2:01:31] so that shows that the faith of judah
[2:01:34] was wrong
[2:01:38] everybody here
[2:01:39] for your faith to be acknowledged
[2:01:43] that you were not lost
[2:01:46] that faith needs to be sanctioned by god
[2:01:52] can i repeat it again
[2:01:54] this is what i'm saying
[2:01:56] somebody let's call this one
[2:01:59] this is two this is three okay
[2:02:02] for you to know truly that your one was
[2:02:05] good
[2:02:06] you must have the tree
[2:02:10] if you have one and two and never had
[2:02:14] three
[2:02:15] something is wrong
[2:02:19] if you give me time you're going to see
[2:02:21] that in your scripture yourself
[2:02:25] hallelujah there is a manifestation of
[2:02:28] justification by faith a man believe god
[2:02:32] say yes sir i believe that i believe
[2:02:34] there is a true god and now for my
[2:02:36] personal savior i accepted jesus christ
[2:02:39] he is the son his son as my personal
[2:02:41] savior now that is what is called
[2:02:45] by faith
[2:02:46] which the disciple received what
[2:02:48] and judah got into this one
[2:02:51] because the bible said the devil
[2:02:52] believes
[2:02:54] by the tremble
[2:02:55] you need to be careful now which faith
[2:02:57] did you receive was that a faith from
[2:02:59] the heart or was it an intellectual
[2:03:01] faith because but faith can move on into
[2:03:04] the tabernacle i'm going to go slow
[2:03:06] lord help me
[2:03:08] the next thing is the man will go out
[2:03:11] the men that got justified will go out
[2:03:14] today he must smoke
[2:03:21] the snake is there remember
[2:03:24] drink
[2:03:25] curse do things that his habit is
[2:03:28] hanging into him
[2:03:29] it's just rooted in there it's spirit
[2:03:32] habits are what
[2:03:34] the bible said they are unclean spirit
[2:03:36] in men
[2:03:38] maybe he is lustful excuse this we are
[2:03:41] in a mixed audience but we are standing
[2:03:43] in the judgment house of god and we must
[2:03:46] say these things clear
[2:03:48] for instance men sometimes especially
[2:03:50] men become lustful sex maniac
[2:03:54] and not only that but just lustful
[2:03:57] way women dress and everything today no
[2:04:00] wonder they are you drive them crazy
[2:04:02] the woman becomes the same way lustful
[2:04:05] spirit get on them and they are nice
[2:04:07] little what
[2:04:10] these people are nice
[2:04:12] they just got to the altar
[2:04:14] but the habits are there
[2:04:16] because the snake is still moving on the
[2:04:18] other coat
[2:04:19] everybody here
[2:04:20] the clean conscience took
[2:04:22] the guiltiness away
[2:04:24] but the snake is still pumping them
[2:04:26] so they still are tempted
[2:04:28] if
[2:04:29] if brother branham prayed for a woman
[2:04:32] and the woman was delivered and one day
[2:04:35] the woman was passing and just heard the
[2:04:37] song and stop and the song could tempt
[2:04:39] her and the devil got into her again
[2:04:42] because the woman was not yet
[2:04:45] into the inside you are subject to
[2:04:48] spirit
[2:04:50] everybody okay and they'll put on short
[2:04:53] clothing
[2:04:55] so if you were in short clothing in this
[2:04:57] church after all that we preach you know
[2:04:59] where you are
[2:05:02] whether you're married or you're not
[2:05:03] married
[2:05:04] anybody here they put on little bitty
[2:05:07] things around them that looks horrible
[2:05:09] why they don't want to be bad
[2:05:12] something is here already want to leave
[2:05:14] for christ
[2:05:15] but the black dog is pressuring and they
[2:05:18] don't know how to fight him they're just
[2:05:20] going by the i'm sorry lord that didn't
[2:05:23] mean that
[2:05:24] so he's still tempting he's under
[2:05:26] justification
[2:05:28] he's in the altar the snake is still
[2:05:30] alive
[2:05:31] everybody okay
[2:05:33] but they don't realize that that old
[2:05:36] passion demon spirit is what
[2:05:39] because on the inside the snake is there
[2:05:44] everybody okay
[2:05:45] they don't do that to appear before god
[2:05:48] they do it not to be cool
[2:05:50] in other words they do it with the wrong
[2:05:52] motive it's a spirit that got on him
[2:05:54] it's a habit
[2:05:55] he doesn't want to do that to be bad in
[2:05:57] his heart i don't want to do it lord i
[2:05:59] don't want to do it i don't want to do
[2:06:00] it i don't want to do it tomorrow i
[2:06:01] won't do it again i won't look at that
[2:06:03] pornography again then tomorrow and when
[2:06:06] as soon as he's his hand out on the
[2:06:07] computer he's watching who's around he
[2:06:10] closes the door and he feels like i need
[2:06:12] to get off the computer you are in a
[2:06:14] justified state you are not born again
[2:06:16] yet
[2:06:20] hallelujah
[2:06:21] hallelujah
[2:06:23] roof and justification
[2:06:25] brother branham remember
[2:06:28] that when you are justified by faith
[2:06:31] now you are a christian right then
[2:06:42] everybody okay
[2:06:46] when you accept jesus as your personal
[2:06:48] savior you are a christian at that time
[2:06:50] that's right i believe if you die right
[2:06:54] then
[2:06:55] do you follow
[2:06:56] me
[2:06:58] when you accept jesus as your savior i
[2:07:01] believe like you are saved that is what
[2:07:04] the dying fifth at the cross was
[2:07:07] follow me carefully maybe i'm gonna stop
[2:07:09] somewhere here
[2:07:11] christ yeah i got to stop here
[2:07:15] you okay
[2:07:17] when you get into the adequate
[2:07:20] and you do what you're supposed to do
[2:07:22] here
[2:07:23] and you are dead to your sin you
[2:07:25] accepted jesus christ
[2:07:27] ever here
[2:07:28] your guilty conscience is gone
[2:07:31] brother branham say
[2:07:32] you got faith now remember peter
[2:07:35] you believe on jesus christ you are
[2:07:37] saved you are not converted yet
[2:07:39] everybody
[2:07:40] because the snake is there
[2:07:42] if you die right there
[2:07:45] at the altar
[2:07:47] you're going to heaven
[2:07:49] relax now
[2:07:51] let me pull the trigger
[2:07:52] what about if i didn't die brother
[2:07:54] stephen
[2:07:59] before you put it in the box
[2:08:02] the question is
[2:08:04] that a man is saved i believe if he's
[2:08:07] looking towards recovery and die in
[2:08:10] daddy's state brother branham is only
[2:08:13] insisting when you get in the altar and
[2:08:17] death struck you in other words you give
[2:08:19] your life now you leave you get in the
[2:08:21] correct boom
[2:08:23] you go into heaven
[2:08:26] listen to me carefully because you
[2:08:29] already did it a long time
[2:08:31] so that option is different now
[2:08:36] certainly i believe he shall be saved
[2:08:40] i believe he got through
[2:08:42] if he had not what
[2:08:50] 20 years justify
[2:08:52] something is wrong
[2:08:54] something is wrong
[2:08:56] are you there
[2:08:57] but depend you go back to the dying fifa
[2:09:00] the cross but remember that was his what
[2:09:04] and what
[2:09:06] that's why god pick him up quickly by
[2:09:08] amazing grace
[2:09:12] but you
[2:09:13] that's not the same case you never died
[2:09:15] when you come to the altar
[2:09:18] that's a problem right there
[2:09:20] let me get this on my land
[2:09:22] you go one night
[2:09:24] don't wait till that time because it
[2:09:27] might not be that way for you
[2:09:29] you might not have a deathbed confession
[2:09:34] somebody is a sinner brother stephen get
[2:09:36] the deacon he's my grandpa let's go to
[2:09:38] the hospital we get there he's there
[2:09:42] were you smoking yes are you doing this
[2:09:45] they're going to pull the machine
[2:09:47] do you accept jesus christ as your
[2:09:49] savior
[2:09:50] do you want to do this do you want to do
[2:09:51] this quickly we bring the berries in
[2:09:53] altar
[2:09:55] not the seven seal the brazen altar
[2:09:56] quickly you need to be praised ready if
[2:10:00] he'd say yes lord forgive me tell my
[2:10:03] wife i'm sorry for the way i treated her
[2:10:05] i'm sorry i'm sorry i'm sorry i'm sorry
[2:10:07] and suddenly
[2:10:10] straight to heaven
[2:10:13] that was his first time and last time no
[2:10:16] other opportunity
[2:10:20] when we get to justification in the edge
[2:10:22] it's going to answer that question you
[2:10:24] have there
[2:10:26] everybody here
[2:10:28] hallelujah i tell you they are all right
[2:10:32] but there are too much of a chance to
[2:10:34] take a chance on don't wait for deathbed
[2:10:38] you let this be your deathbed right now
[2:10:42] that you die out now
[2:10:44] and be born again off the water
[2:10:48] don't wait because you don't know if
[2:10:49] it's going to happen to you
[2:10:53] oh my god
[2:10:55] everybody here
[2:10:57] because
[2:10:58] it it takes right back to this day when
[2:11:01] the fifth was hanging on the cross and
[2:11:04] he died without being baptized at all
[2:11:08] about here so the man we went to the
[2:11:10] hospital with brother kelly the man is
[2:11:12] dying we could not take him from rcu and
[2:11:15] put him in a lava
[2:11:16] to baptize him he's going to heaven god
[2:11:19] is rescuing the seed by amazing grace he
[2:11:22] pulled the emergency bullet he put it in
[2:11:24] and said devil get your hand off whether
[2:11:26] you're there or not i'm gonna take him
[2:11:28] that's it everybody here now and he died
[2:11:30] without being baptized at all and yet
[2:11:33] with a promise that jesus will meet him
[2:11:35] in the paradise that day in paradise not
[2:11:38] in the region of the lost
[2:11:39] why because it was the
[2:11:43] the opportunity was what
[2:11:47] what about you now and then i stop
[2:11:50] hallelujah if a man ever comes
[2:11:54] to a spot that he has been saved
[2:12:00] like peter
[2:12:02] saved everybody okay
[2:12:04] and what
[2:12:06] you moved on here now
[2:12:09] hey
[2:12:10] the blood sanctified hebrew 13 12 and 13
[2:12:14] says the blood sanctified and then come
[2:12:17] right up to the gate of the baptism of
[2:12:19] the holy ghost
[2:12:21] and because of what
[2:12:27] or what
[2:12:29] he refused to do what
[2:12:32] that person is what and what
[2:12:41] when i will get to marriage i'm going to
[2:12:43] show you how it applied to marriage also
[2:12:47] this goes with marriage when i show you
[2:12:48] the three room in marriage
[2:12:52] they can kick you out
[2:12:54] those that were yesterday pick up some
[2:12:55] of them
[2:12:56] ever here
[2:12:58] that person can never be saved for he
[2:13:01] has done despite even the very work of
[2:13:04] grace that calls him up to that place
[2:13:08] and shown it to him and then turn around
[2:13:10] and walk away from it
[2:13:13] because it's one work
[2:13:15] one spirit but that spirit pick you up
[2:13:18] and pull you to the altar
[2:13:19] when you alter he get baptized you when
[2:13:22] you baptize he pull you to another state
[2:13:24] so when he open you cannot stay where
[2:13:26] you are
[2:13:27] you follow me you gotta move on as he's
[2:13:30] moving you
[2:13:32] hallelujah
[2:13:34] he can't the blood of the covenant where
[2:13:37] if he was crucified as a holy thing
[2:13:39] because the blood does save him
[2:13:42] and justify him and sanctify him bring
[2:13:45] him up to the baptism of the holy ghost
[2:13:48] and then he walk away and leave it
[2:13:53] it's not your first and your last
[2:13:55] opportunity brother branham if possible
[2:13:58] for a person to be lost and end up in
[2:14:01] hell if he reject the light of the world
[2:14:04] even though he has genuine experience of
[2:14:07] justification and what
[2:14:10] yes sir that's exactly right
[2:14:16] what are we saying
[2:14:18] what are we saying
[2:14:19] where are you in the tabernacle
[2:14:23] because when you stop you die i'm gonna
[2:14:26] show you that in the ages
[2:14:29] everybody
[2:14:30] once you get here
[2:14:32] if it's your first and last opportunity
[2:14:34] you're dead god pick you up but if
[2:14:36] you're not dead and you're going home
[2:14:38] you need to be very careful
[2:14:41] because god didn't justify you for gamer
[2:14:45] the purpose is to clean you up
[2:14:47] now you need to move forward and start
[2:14:50] cleaning we will get to roof serving now
[2:14:53] and back here when you stop moving that
[2:14:55] way you need to move all the way when
[2:14:58] you get to the serving and god finishes
[2:15:00] with you god himself will open the third
[2:15:03] one
[2:15:05] and if you start belittling the spirit
[2:15:09] and playing with the supernatural
[2:15:12] you need to be very careful because it's
[2:15:15] a door that god is opening now for you
[2:15:17] to get in and to jump into it
[2:15:20] if you are dead
[2:15:22] spare but if you're alive
[2:15:25] as long as the light unfolded you have
[2:15:28] to keep moving with the light
[2:15:30] all the way the only place you can stop
[2:15:34] and you rest
[2:15:38] is when
[2:15:39] number three have come and sanction you
[2:15:43] then there is nothing else to do
[2:15:45] you take your hand off
[2:15:47] your car is in neutral and somebody else
[2:15:49] begin to drag you in the entire life
[2:15:53] then you do something wrong somebody
[2:15:54] tell you go back and repent
[2:15:57] go back and correct it go back and fix
[2:15:59] it with your wife i'm sorry she talked
[2:16:01] bad to me you need to go back and do it
[2:16:03] again
[2:16:04] everybody you don't want it and he
[2:16:06] paralyzed your body
[2:16:08] you go and something struck you pop a
[2:16:10] car boom and when something happened an
[2:16:12] accident i'm sorry lord i need to go fix
[2:16:14] that problem quickly because somebody
[2:16:16] now is taking over
[2:16:22] peter
[2:16:23] have the faith
[2:16:25] not converted yet
[2:16:27] he could do all the supernatural
[2:16:29] by the same thing he could also curse
[2:16:32] you can sing like an angel
[2:16:34] and you can live like a devil
[2:16:40] let's stand there
[2:16:50] let's pray
[2:16:52] heavenly father
[2:16:54] lord we are approaching you again humbly
[2:16:57] father this afternoon lord thanking you
[2:17:00] for your grace
[2:17:01] for your love and for your mercy
[2:17:04] lord if it was not for the mercies of
[2:17:06] god
[2:17:07] we will be also being confused
[2:17:09] completely
[2:17:10] and being in the babylon because this
[2:17:13] thing the devil wanted to be confused
[2:17:16] so that your children will be confused
[2:17:19] and they don't know where they are while
[2:17:21] the coming of the lord is so imminent
[2:17:23] that one of these days you are coming to
[2:17:26] pick up your bride
[2:17:28] father we have unfolded the roof
[2:17:31] through grace
[2:17:32] we have unfolded roof
[2:17:34] through the tabernacle
[2:17:36] we have unfolded roof at the brazen
[2:17:38] altar and today we have unfolded a
[2:17:42] portion of roof
[2:17:44] in justification at the brazen altar
[2:17:47] we still have to go through
[2:17:48] justification in the liver
[2:17:51] before we move on through the age
[2:17:54] father but i believe enough is spoken
[2:17:56] already
[2:17:57] that your children might recognize where
[2:18:00] they are
[2:18:01] if they are in the tabernacle or they
[2:18:04] are not in the tabernacle if they are in
[2:18:06] a justified state or they already passed
[2:18:09] that justified state
[2:18:11] if they are under uh sanctification and
[2:18:14] they are not in the holy of holies
[2:18:16] or if they already have the holy
[2:18:19] the holiest experience and now they are
[2:18:21] just resting preparing for the abduction
[2:18:25] father
[2:18:26] this is not an intellectual teaching
[2:18:29] this is something that you unfolded
[2:18:31] because you spoke in your word that you
[2:18:33] shall know the truth
[2:18:35] and the truth has set you free
[2:18:37] and this truth has been revealed lord
[2:18:39] through this message
[2:18:41] not to feed us with our intellectual but
[2:18:44] father to set us free because he that
[2:18:47] the son have set free is truly is free
[2:18:51] indeed and father if there is anybody
[2:18:53] any young man or any parent or any
[2:18:56] married couple they have not seen
[2:18:59] the importance of their christian life
[2:19:02] and that still give themselves to the
[2:19:04] things of the world
[2:19:05] because they're after their own
[2:19:07] objective
[2:19:09] their own agenda their own project
[2:19:12] despite everything that is happening in
[2:19:14] the world
[2:19:15] father they're not paying attention much
[2:19:18] to the faints of the spirit until they
[2:19:20] become even non-sensible father to the
[2:19:24] speaking of the spirit
[2:19:26] lord may your grace and your mercy come
[2:19:28] down and may you touch them
[2:19:30] may you shake them lord with a hand of
[2:19:33] grace
[2:19:34] so that they can wake up and realize
[2:19:37] where they are
[2:19:38] and if they miss a step may they go
[2:19:41] straight to that altar and fix it
[2:19:44] and die to their own country and die to
[2:19:47] their own tradition and die to their own
[2:19:50] family and die to their own friend
[2:19:52] and die to their own clique they've been
[2:19:55] so long in these years lord and father
[2:19:58] make sure that you the god of this
[2:20:01] message you become their personal god
[2:20:04] and father if something happened and
[2:20:06] they be buried today they are going with
[2:20:09] the hope of eternal life knowing lord
[2:20:11] father that one of this day they will
[2:20:14] rise up and meet you in the air lord i
[2:20:16] commit everything unto the hand and i
[2:20:18] commit their families unto the hand may
[2:20:20] you continue to protect us and may you
[2:20:23] take this word that has been spoken lord
[2:20:25] and may you unfold it more and more
[2:20:27] until lord father they can ruminate on
[2:20:30] these things and father come to the
[2:20:33] realization that this is not a plain
[2:20:35] time it's homegoing time father i pray
[2:20:39] and i commit everything unto the hand
[2:20:41] and ask it in the name of jesus christ
[2:20:44] amen
