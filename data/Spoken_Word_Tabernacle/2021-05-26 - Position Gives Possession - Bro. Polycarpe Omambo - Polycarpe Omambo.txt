his grace hallelujah there was someone who sent a question through one of the deacon and the question was about a cosmetology something about makeup and work so i was trying to figure it out who sent that question but we have not it seems like we missed to answer that question so lord's willing somehow if you can whoever wrote that question if you can either contact brother robert or brother mike uh brad robert or brother kelly i was about to say about mike daley but my kid is a is a trustee brother robert o'brien kelly just let him know that you're the one that wrote it i would like to answer

know so we can answer that question specifically to understand what is going on some of the questions we can answer them publicly some of them we cannot it might be something hidden somewhere and we want to make sure we understand where you're coming from what is going on before we answer and then we miss it amen so tonight i'm not preaching amen but i'm going to be preaching through interpretation amen so brother polycarp will be the one preaching tonight it has been a while that we had brought a polycarp so he's one of our local minister here tonight so he will be preaching there is nothing i can say about brother polycarp as far as introduction you already know who brother polycarp is he's a wonderful brother one of us here so let's pull on the gift of the lord and let

tonight to preach his word and i want to thank the pastor who and i will be ungrateful if i don't thank each one of you so since you are standing without taking too much of your time let's go to genesis chapter 3. genesis chapter 3 verse 6 through 11. and we will drop straight ahead to 21. genesis chapter 3 verse 6 to 11 and we drop down to 21. hallelujah christian i'm going to read in the name of jesus christ that the tree was good for food and that it was pleasant to the eyes and a tree to be desired to make one wise she took off the fruit thereof and did eat and gave also on to her husband with her and he did it let's pray eternally heavenly father created we are coming in front of you just out of the way may you take the full control because it's written that they are all be taught of god in the name of jesus christ amen amen you might be seated tonight no continuing i'm going to continue with our reading this is a story that most of you know i'm going to continue on verse 7. and the eyes of both of them were open and they knew that they were naked and they sowed fig leaves together and made themselves aprons here and they heard the voice of the lord god walking in the midst in the garden in the cool of the day and adams and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the lord among the trees of the garden [Music] i just want you to keep in mind this very particular part adam and his wife heed themselves from the presence of the lord i want you to remember that um among the trees of the garden now we drop to verse 9. and the lord god called unto adam and say unto him where are the and i was afraid because i was naked and i hate myself eternally to your knee and he said who told thee that that was naked yes yes [Music] verse 21 unto adam also and to his wife did the lord god made coats of skins and clothe them may the lord add the blessing to the reading of his word tonight i have a little subject tonight and my title is position gives possession measurement recommended i would like to start with one of brother branham uh quote he was preaching a message witness in 1954 on march 3rd and i'm going to start by paragraph 25. this is what i'm speaking jesus christ is in this building tonight to perform miracles but he does it through his church his people examples they shall lay their hand on the sick and they shall recover [Music] in my name they shall cast out the evil spirit is that right la commission the commission is given in the to the church cesar le problem that's what's the matter with the church tonight he does not know its position amen amen today we're speaking about your position if you know positionally who you was and what you are tonight in your happy in a personal favor you see there won't be a feeble person in here in the next five minutes the prophet is that if you recognize your position tonight yesterday i present community it just takes only five minutes there won't be any here tonight amen amen that's right they think of it is you are looking off into the millennium for something to happen when it's already here now we are the sons of god not we will be we are right now the sons of god is not saying that you will be the sons of god but right now you are sons of god because in the next five minutes the same version we must change the sin in this place the education shall ascend and the one who usually change our situation will do it tonight when tonight right now a certain minute to see this minute we are sitting together i see assembly celeste in heavenly places in christ jesus and the supreme authority that jesus christ has given to every believer two seconds anything you have desire of say don't forget persuade need often do that you live for fair only thing you have to do say demand you receive it and it shall be given unto you mark 11 24 amen amen so as we spoke in the next five minutes so something must happen in this place not replacing our little subject tonight opposition gives possession the position so the position you're going to take tonight will give you what you want where we read in genesis chapter 3 it's a story that most of us already know they said but i want to approach it in this angle that is there was a tabernacle that was among the trees and the name of that tabernacle was trees tabernacle amen amen and the pastor was preaching the word coming here he was coming to fellowship with them amen amen so he was coming to check every situation that happened to his children amen amen and you and one day notre say our sister eva was visited by one of the elders one of the elders of the church that went to visit evil connect man these snakes are different than the serpent in the garden of eden who connected to cellar you already know the mystery about it so the elders say wait a minute why would you should i may never be blessed i must also bring my own bible and jesus i must also bring something to the evangelization my time now it is my time and then he went to sister eve amen amen ever when he met sister eva illadie esqueday she he asked sister eve did god really adire did god really say the question that you shall not eat of every tree that is in the garden amen amen allah and you so one day a prayer predication the pastor elohim after the sermon of brother of pastor elohim amen amen last season manifested the elder came as we've already spoken he said let me take my sermon just like i explained it to you he asked the question if you notice he never was specific about which god which fruit but he says every tree in general brother branham said when the devil approaches you usually comes with 99.9 of the truth that's where the lies say voila that's the reason why in the garden of eden last year attention evacuation critique recommendations are very so the elder approaches with scriptures he brought his bible and his coach he like come and say i eventually said so he begin to preach to me laughing [Applause] and that's where usually the devil will get you ela and sister eve after listening to the sermon he said you know what you're right so when the elders say they always say that god knows that the day you shall eat of this tree you will be very smart it's going to open your mind ever ever to vegeta so my our sister he found that he was needed amen or serpent he was saying amen when elohim was preaching he was not the old serpent that told her say amen but she said a man out of herself of the sermon the serpent hallelujah we say amen to the sermon and later on she brought the fruit into adam you know the story about him and if you notice right after the ate the fruit they ran away from the church sunset food this is verse nine giles they run away from church amen amen if you notice in verse nine they run away from the church now god begin to chase after them elohim the pastor elohim was going after them when he came to the tabernacle he looked where uh brother adam who used to sit and where sister eve used to sit all their places are empty he found their place is empty he said what's going on in china is happening is keeping people at home oh what is going on amen amen frederick brother adam and sister eve they were not in service that's when god begin to scream asking the question adam adam where down why where down let the legroom say this is church time this is the time of prayers this is the time we usually fellowship escalator is this the work of your taxes that kept you at home or what are those things the church of the living room coming to church on the behalf of coronavirus amen so while elohim was shouting scripture searching for his children adam and eve were there but they were heartbreaking among the trees of the garden remember they were hidden from the presence of god in amongst the trees of the garden they're hidden from the presence of the lord amen amen but the question is here tonight god dearest when god was looking for them i'm gonna ask you a question do you think god did not know where they were you nellis are they perfect do you think god didn't see them where they were hiding pascha nous and not rejected because we know that our god and then he can see very far deeper as you one day david david stated [Music] it is not that god did not know where they were you want to know why god was asking them the question was asking them a question in this way adam if where is your position now [Music] you sin jacob god already know about your sin two second to your affair everything you have done in your life yet connie god already is aware of it but when you did what you already done tell a position to your priest what is the position you taken toward god and you will notice most of the time at that point instead of adam searching for god because he's in trouble said jeremy tennacious church he was actually god looking for adam who fell into sin amen amen elizo free they run away to hide himself dear no matter what happened to them dear a foreign near the predication after the last service in a position i know after my last sermon and nowhere i know that you have authority against jesus [Applause] where are you in your position brother branham he could call leo and just play with him of the question where or down come here like tonight god is asking you the same question where are down to your appreciated position which position do you have you're crying for every single disease its own positions the second news of the holy prophet we read brother in the culture amen amen you who could pray for the slaves when they were trouble in the church the problem is that they knew that there may be a problem in the society in your family there are people used to lost that we are solutions but when you come into a problem is and god is asking you the same question tonight amen amen shake your brother and ask him the question where are the key where down do you have a position which position do you have tonight who now you are standing which position do you have because we must put the dot in the right place you see so you are right here tonight but you are the true person god is jesus and god is talking to you tonight amen amen hallelujah glory be to god i'm going to read another quote from brother branham israel israel and the church is it's usually israel and the church part three but it's israel at the red sea there is no second towards the rotor they said it's uh preached on uh uh 1953 on march uh the 29th 27th the 27th i'm gonna read the paragraph 46 peter all christendom is looking for the coming of the lord and the rapture of the church do a connection to the alcohol oh that is got any knowledge of the world well i said that if we can have faith enough for divine healing how are we going to have a rapture in faith brothers and sisters you are waiting for the rapture but you don't have enough faith that god can make that disease disappear from your mind how do you believe about the rapture amen amen i'm going to continue oh jacob oh i believe there is love i believe like david he lay there and waited on the effort he listened and waited after he heard the rushing wind going through the marbury going around he know god was going before him oh my friend oh brother the faith i'm listening to the rushing of the leaves the noise in the murdery bushes god and go [Applause] instead of god calling on him adam was healing you see the prophet where we just read brother branham tonight brother branham was talking about david who was waiting somewhere you'll have any problems he had a battle in front of the emperor and he was waiting for the breath again he wanted to go to work but he want to be sure i'm not tonight who fair remember shows to do and perform the same thing amen amen we're going to paragraph 23 of the series in the same sermon [Music] comes from a strength in the garden of eden lost concern on the continent when man realized he had sinned in a religion he tried to make himself a relative a covering if and since then it has been a strain of men down through the edges trying to do something to save his self the prophet what brother pranam is saying here is that bringing back to remembrance the story of adam and eve you have a covering which we call religion amen amen when god was wrong they were afraid [Music] brother branham said they were already scared because fear got its place in today now look at god watch this god who knows the end from the beginning [Applause] the bible said god created man in his own image how can god create man in his own image let the tweet and destroy his own images on prophet sees he already [Laughter] because god could not destroy his own testimony brothers and sisters today he said you have faithfully maybe you stole something maybe you went and uh still running away the obliques you are forgetting something personally that's the really people that you are running away they will feel in a pressure if god they just want to open stand in the gap for you [Applause] god already knew what you were and explain his sovereignty that skill is appealing because god was a servant if adam never felt how could he say says what you need but if you were not in your country how could god serve you amen amen amen amen never give you a person may be in front of god we are always sinners may come at you unto the machine but how are you walking to listen to the man how are you keep working working with condemnation in your life and remaining instead of coming back to god and adam was scared he was scared of god he's the god that can change synchronously amen he will change it tonight [Music] amen gloria glory be to god paragraph eventually i'm gonna go to paragraph 23 of the same sermon but you are saved by grace i just want you to pay attention to what brother brothers because it's already written in scripture you are saved by grace election election god's for with knowledge amen amen the joy of god apologize allegri's the first paul tells the church that god destinated us in christ our valor foundation demanded before the foundation of the world by say think of it before the foundation so why we worry about the denim getting away get away from the worries we criminal when people were looking at paul they said that's a criminal critic because he was the one whooping christian and casting them follow jesus and but paul is saying that the murderer [Applause] find yourself in darkness because the people of fire move forward amen amen god is keep moving amen amen the prophet says he's saying this experiences you already have the loud experience you have a lot of testimony that's good but you must remember all of the other history now fresh foreign that means that you must always walk with the peter of fire second to your fear that you're going to worship yesterday you must do it again blessed be the name of the lord the prophet brother said we must be the happiest people when you're hearing this word and you were predestinated a valid foundation for the foundation of the world i'm trying to go quickly with time [Music] there is three questions in genesis that god asked in the book of genesis question he asked adam where are them god to say what have that done amen amen and the third question god asked cain amen amen welcome friend where is your brother amen three questions amen question in the book of genesis all those three questions if you noticed god never asked those questions to a man when his position with him is correct they say he always asked those questions when men what position are you taking first to your condition basket energy intelligence because a smart child lost forte when he does something wrong eleven come appear for example he will say like peter lost questions when jesus looked at them he said what are you waiting go like everybody else peter say lord because you have the word where else can i go that was the answer of jesus that is a true position of a church let's go to the book of samuel livre somewhere and they were uh attackers so for david numbers count he wanted to recruit as many military as he could second until the the the the nombre the military lavender in other words he put his faith in the greatest army that he had yes and god god was not pleased with him i'm just going to start from verse 12 you can read the whole story at home when you get time okay that dudes go and say unto david just say the lord jesus proposed to offer i offered these three things she was the one that i made unto because he wanted to correct his childhood version verse 15. later on foreign [Music] 70 [Music] [Music] go read the story at home david the vancouver plane they gave them three options okay jelly proposition that god proposed him swati jean voila either i'm gonna send feminine oh i'm gonna bring the pestilence la peste says the pestilence it was god's own responsibility to walk and if you notice in the mirror david stated he said i cannot be free amen because men will never give these women they're going to kill me i'm choosing correction to be corrected by god i want to be cooperative so it's not good for me to be in the hands of my enemy amen amen and that's what he chose he lost and when god began to kill the people they went amen he said what did you i see this sin is at the door but you have power over it but nevertheless if you can give me a little bit of time let me touch gideon who is our elderly he would they were media that pascal because the is of israel said that jesus said you can go to the book of judges chapter seven verses two four all the way to seven allah now um but give you honestly position then after jesus heard the position of a child opposition he stood with the words at the sandwiches so god came down and went in to gideon and god saw him he said he said i want to bring deliverance to these people i want you to pick up some men and go fight jesus rushing quickly you can read the whole story all i'm trying to do is to show you that your position gives you your possession amen and if you notice that story gideon chose 32 000 men if 22 000 people left amen amen hallelujah hallelujah so there were ten thousand left there didn't know god still locations are they are between two opinions let me work with them and let me let the lord take them to the water lost universe when they get to the river the and they are the remaining that will be just nailed down all the way to the mouth from the river you can send the other one

of a month in a position but i just want to show you the position these young men took leroy we will be heeding the fiery furnace seven times harder yeah this the the reprieve that no matter what you're going to do we're not going to bow down they're coming no it's just a sword it is just like you and me tonight no choir or message in the prophet message of william prophet that brother branham is the prophet of the earth god's mouthpiece prophet elijah he's god man for the age of privilege we are a privileged people christ we believe that from all our hearts there let me say something let's get a when usually you heard pastors saying that they have a right to preach whatever doctrine in their church just like we have a church here let's say my courageous is free to preach his own doctrine for example maybe in the time of luther that could happen [Music] they have the right to preach the message what i would do i would just wipe the kingdom of babylon all the way out of map a cause they said two of them because of these three faithful faults but how can you be tonight see on professor remember belong if they could wipe babylon for three minutes don't you think that god can wipe that cancer can wipe that sickness because that's it wipe that situation this is my own business jealousy i know what i'm doing when they were praying i was with them that's what they did let me tell you something when you pray there is always somebody standing beside them you don't recognize who you are the prophet this is what you are recognizing if tonight we can recognize our position in the next five minutes they're not going to tell you to say if you know your position [Music] when you read them every time you read the scripture they refer to the [Music] do you know that few minutes before they got into the furnace those three hebrew could uh ask one another did you really pray we were we getting into the fire oh brother don't worry i'm sure of my problems oh i bet are you sure man man i didn't only pray i even fasted man i'm ready for it you okay they say okay we're waiting for you [Music] oh i just want you to take it lord israel we rise and go possess our possession tonight paragraph 127 i don't know what is your position today is inviting you now to stand today now stand tonight and go possess possession your own your inheritance [Music] now disconnected you know what you're going through that god gives you the position la position your position or not that shall see in jesus name capacity that the blessings are able to move [Music] we want to die today we want to possess a sword god didn't come back just to continue we came to you he came to him remember to the one who that man he heard salvation he went to paris consecutively that's what jesus taught in the book of lords this is but you have 17 foreign we casting a demon of infirmities let demon necessity demon of infirmity the market deficient offered the trouble in the eyes second fecal and something foreign we are in your prayers we are in your prayers father we need senior manifesto foreign your children change come foreign we are the hallelujah amen let's give the lord a hand tonight [Applause] amen that was zeroed in a bullseye message amen ride on target position give possession amen we thank god for his word tonight [Applause] hallelujah thank you jesus we have been talking with uh some time we talked with brother kelly just as a pastor to deacon or brother robert and but kelly mentioned something he says if the people can only realize that the ministry that the lord have brought in this church is not to kill you it's not to condemn you even though it's shaking your life even though it's squeezing that black dog and chasing you all around everywhere it is god mercy amen sometimes it sounds like it's tough sometimes it sounds like it's a correction but that correction is to get that devil off of floyd life amen people has been living for so long housing devils amen and being living a defeated life over and over and pretending on the outside like everything is and on top of that a spirit of proud has anointed a lot of folks until they don't want to talk to nobody they don't want to respond to the deacon they don't want to respond to the pastor they don't want to even be in help they want to run away they think they can handle the situation they want so and so to handle the situation and they are missing that all that god is doing by uncovering the devil there is one thing that satan doesn't like is to be uncovered so when the scripture comes and catch him and bring him to the surface all that god is telling you is that impurity because when they take gold god usually have impurities but when they hit the gold into the fire what happened to the impurities you have to come on the surface then when everything come on the surface they would take something like uh like a wood and scrape it and when you look it's gonna shine like a glass then god can see his own reflection in the gold amanda that is all the ministry here sometimes it catches you you do something and it comes on the pulpit it is just god telling you that when you were doing it i was there it is just god telling you that you have been pretending so much that you're a christian you are not where you are supposed to be and i'm just showing you all of this so that you realize that you need help amen if you continue to hold on to your old religion life you're going to stay behind and you won't understand god is not bringing his word to the christianize you god is bringing his word to show you that you are thinking you're on level 10 you are not there you are in level one understand that you're in level one when you recognize that you're in level one and you begin to pray like level one i'm gonna come down to level one and pick you up and raise you up but you can be in level one and you're trying to pretend like you're in level 10 amen because that is what intellectual messages has brought in the message camp amen the people can quote the message the people can argue about the message the people can spend time on the facebook arguing debating but their life is completely torn out they cannot even pray and cast out devil everything is about medication everything our our home is filled with all kind of medication whenever something happens it's get that motrin get that ibuprofen get that trauma though get that codeine get that allergy medication so when is that allergy gonna leave your body amen so god is just showing you adam adam where are they even if you've been 40 years in this message forget about it let me repeat it again maybe you didn't get it even if you were 40 years in this message even if you were born in the message this is what the devil used as a covering as a religion i was born in a message i was raised in a message i was in this church we already heard all this kind of uh doctrine before yes you heard this doctrine before where are you in your state with all the years you heard those doctrine there is nothing new we already heard about the seals okay if you heard the seals before show me the life of the seals because the one who reached their life could speak and squirrel comes so if you already heard all the dog treatments where are you at amen because there was a spirit of fight in the message fighting from the pulpit fighting from this pastor to this pastor and he brought spirit of camp there is a camp that believed this camp that believed this and the souls of the people were neglected and the intellectuals open up and begin to suck the word and people feel like they are entitled into something i remember i am a child of so and so my brother in so and so my pastor and so and so where are you at with all the knowledge you have you can come to church with all the knowledge you have you can stay five months three months you don't come to church with all the knowledge that you have look at what you're doing at work look at your tax paper look how you are treating your wife look how you are children uh uh uh uh uh how you are treating your own husband but you know the seals it's an intellectual knowledge the bible says that when he opened our heart did not burn when he opened the scripture this opening of the scripture is to hit the heart and bring you back to your original prayers not to heat up your head because you're going to be arrogant and use court and scripture to go fight we're not giving you those code to get on facebook and get into the fighting we're giving you those code to stabilize your own faith for your own self and for your salvation and your christian relationship between you and god not you and somebody else in some other churches so please forget your ages in the message forgetted what you were in the old churches because this is why you're going to meet christian and you're going to be disappointed because you're talking to somebody you're thinking oh he should be in level 10 and he does something you say wait a minute i thought this is a preacher what happened is people had that intellectual they got sucked in the message the message the message fellowship eating in the restaurant playing around things and nothing happened when a demon come we came and pray the first thing go to the emergency room go to the emergency room go to the emergency room go to the emergency room there is no faith zero faith zero faith we have more faith in loans i don't know where these stuff are coming from we have more faith in loans than to have faith that god can give you a car without anything if you ask somebody that they won't even believe it yet the third pool the third pool the turn pool the third pool is lord jesus christ would you please help me so that this loan can get approved and that loan will put you and your family in bondage and you can come to church because of darlone amen where is that prayer that you can say father i don't have anything i don't even know where to start that's why sometimes god let some of your credit report to be damaged until when you go they bounce you up when you go the bank show up then through it all you're going to learn to trust jesus then at that point he comes up he say now you know that this is nobody else this is my hand amen why because that intellectual faith is going to boast when it comes to a situation uh let's go to the marriage counselor where is your prayer because you don't believe your own prayer it is god's mercy it's coming like a whooping but it's not truly a whooping behind it there is a special grace of door that has been opened to clean you up and to move you out amen let's be humble in this church i know the spirit has seen i'm not saying everybody is having it but i've seen the spirit humble yourself before the word of god humility is when they bring you the word and you just humble yourself that's true humility just humble yourself and know that yes that's me right there father help me like the fed like the the the republican you just know you say i'm not even worthy but we have pharisees i do this we were there oh that convention i was there yes i was there i was also there yes we're the one that did this we're the one that did this nothing nothing nothing forget about it my brother get serious with god check your life make sure everything is good he's just bringing you a total deliverance to prepare you because power without character is satanic he would never give you the third pull if that character is not clean up if you not clean up you cannot get to the second banquet of esther that's why that banquet has been held in us all along i can't preach to that banquet because we gotta clean up clean up clean up clean up clean up clean up then when you get there amen is powerless who was asking for mercy mnu's the one boasting when he goes everybody burning but in the second banquet a man went into the bed where esther was and was kneeling there asking for mercy to the brother how can a big man a prime minister the first one after the king go beg for mercy not to the king to a woman a man understood the power of grace that was embedded in the bride and he want to be getting access to that grace but that grace is for only the bride misses grace to use it for her own people like rahab use that grace for her own house not to save the other seed but to save only the house of heir and go out you see the mystery heavenly father lord we thank you again for your grace for your love your mercy and for this mighty sermon that you have spoken to us bringing again lord deliverance to your children father may you strengthen your servant that you use tonight lord and may you strengthen as well the church lord and may you remove every religious spirit that has been holding the people order from their deliverance lord and making them feel like they have a right there have a right their evil heart may you remove it completely but may the spirit of the lamb come lord just like you clothed adam and eve in the garden of eden father come and clothe us with that quiet and mixed spirit father that can follow the dove because that's what we needed lord fathers will be with them bless them and father give them travel mercy as we commit everything unto their hand in the name of jesus christ amen but robert you're going to lead us with one song and then you can dismiss a bless your church hallelujah amen we are privileged people believers let me get this together amen praise god i want to sing this chorus every promise in the book is mine as brother stephen was emphasizing amen amen this is not just intellectual the lord is not coming just to just to puff our heads up amen the purpose of malachi 4 being revealed was to turn our hearts back amen when the heart is turned everything will follow when our heads are turned we have mixed messages in our lives amen as we sing this chorus before we as we about to be dismissed let's just let our hearts follow god's will he has given it to us in humility every promise in the book is mine amen it must be personal [Music] every promise in the book is mine every chapter every verse every line [Music] i am trusting in his love divine every promise in the book is every promise o every promise in the book is mine every chapter every verse every line i am trusting in his love divine every promise in the book is mine as we are dismissed oh every promise let's go with god's word in our hearts every promise every chapter every verse every line i am trusting in his love divine every promise in the book is mine [Music] hallelujah is mine every chapter
