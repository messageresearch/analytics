[55:06] again that's why when we come into the

[55:17] God amen amen amen
[55:26] as you standing let's go straight to our
[55:28] scripture in the book of

[55:36] 28 1-6 the book of act chapter 28 verse
[55:42] 1 through six can
[55:46] everybody okay
[55:50] okay the last chapter of the book of act
[55:53] let's read in the name of Jesus Christ
[56:00] [Applause]
[56:04] and when they were escaped then they
[56:06] knew that the island was called
[56:24] mea and the his people showed us no
[56:28] little kindness for they kindled a fire
[56:31] and receive as everyone because of the
[56:33] present rain and because of the
[56:48] cold and when Paul had gather a bundle
[56:51] of sticks and laid them on the fire
[56:53] there came a viper out of the Heat and
[56:56] fasten on his
[57:14] hand and when The Barbarians saw the
[57:17] venomous Beast hang on his hand they
[57:20] said among themselves no doubt this man
[57:22] is a murderer whom though he has escaped
[57:25] the sea yet Vengeance suffer not to
[57:32] leave he shook off the Beast Into the
[57:35] Fire and felt no
[57:51] harm how be the look when they should
[57:53] have swld that when he should have sold
[57:56] and fallen down dead suddenly but after
[57:59] they had looked a great while and saw no
[58:02] harm come to him they change their minds
[58:05] and say that he was a
[58:08] god let's

[1:00:46] name of Jesus Christ
[1:00:49] amen God richly bless you you might be
[1:00:52] seated
[1:00:56] tonight I would like to speak on a
[1:01:00] subject that are
[1:01:04] titled the infallibility of the word of
[1:01:07] God amen
[1:01:10] amen
[1:01:12] amen the word of God is
[1:01:15] infallible am
[1:01:19] amen the word of God has an objective a
[1:01:23] purpose to teach
[1:01:26] to
[1:01:27] correct to
[1:01:30] instruct to build
[1:01:32] up in a good
[1:01:35] way that is the purpose of the word of
[1:01:41] God if you go to the Book of John
[1:01:43] chapter
[1:01:45] 6 verse
[1:01:49] 66 these are the word of Jesus
[1:01:53] himself after he had done so many Mir
[1:01:57] miracles did so many wonders
[1:02:00] things he gave so many
[1:02:04] advices and now he's talking to his
[1:02:07] disciples and I'm going to read it to
[1:02:10] you blessed be the word of the
[1:02:16] Lord John
[1:02:19] 6
[1:02:22] 63 the Bible says us this
[1:02:27] it is the spirit that
[1:02:30] Quicken the flesh profit
[1:02:34] nothing the words that I speak unto
[1:02:39] you they are spirit and they are life
[1:02:43] amen
[1:02:46] amen so there is only one
[1:02:49] place where you can find
[1:02:53] life life dwells in in the words of
[1:02:56] Jesus in the word of God am
[1:03:02] amen and the word have as a purpose as I
[1:03:05] already mentioned to teach to
[1:03:08] correct to
[1:03:10] instruct and to edify or build
[1:03:14] up that is the purpose of the word of
[1:03:17] God blessed be the name of the
[1:03:22] Lord there are certain things in our
[1:03:24] lives
[1:03:27] that you can receive from
[1:03:29] Elders you might receive it from an
[1:03:33] adult or maybe from your
[1:03:36] parents maybe you may learn it in school
[1:03:39] or among friends but other
[1:03:44] things only the word of God can give it
[1:03:47] to you only the word of God can give it
[1:03:51] to you only the word can give
[1:03:54] it eternal
[1:03:56] life only the word of God can it to no
[1:04:00] one can give you eternal life only the
[1:04:03] word of
[1:04:06] God in the book of
[1:04:10] Psalm chapter
[1:04:14] 107 verse 19 and
[1:04:18] 20 I'm going to read it
[1:04:23] quickly the Bible says this
[1:04:28] blessed be the name of the
[1:04:30] Lord Psalm 107 verse
[1:04:38] 19 listen to what God is speaking
[1:04:42] through
[1:04:46] David then they
[1:04:49] cry unto the Lord in their
[1:04:54] trouble and he said them out of their
[1:04:57] distresses now listen
[1:05:00] carefully he sent his
[1:05:05] word and healed
[1:05:09] them and delivered them from their
[1:05:14] destructions so when you have
[1:05:17] problems when you are crying unto the
[1:05:21] Lord when you are praying unto the Lord
[1:05:26] oh when you go consult a man of
[1:05:29] God he will give you the
[1:05:32] word and it's that word that will bring
[1:05:36] healing because in the word there is
[1:05:40] power in the word of God there is
[1:05:42] Deliverance amen
[1:05:45] amen that's why when they were in
[1:05:49] trouble the Bible said they cry to the
[1:05:52] Lord they did whatever they could do
[1:05:56] God never send
[1:05:59] weapon God never send
[1:06:02] money but God sent his
[1:06:05] word and the word brought
[1:06:09] Deliverance that's why I read this Psalm
[1:06:13] 107 blessed be the name of the
[1:06:18] Lord remember
[1:06:20] title the infallibility of the word of
[1:06:23] God
[1:06:26] if you just uh take such as
[1:06:30] this in the time of
[1:06:33] Noah God
[1:06:36] spoke and he instructed Noah to build an
[1:06:40] ark amen but now remember inent time
[1:06:45] also God also spoke to
[1:06:48] Noah to also build an arc in
[1:06:52] this in other words they need to store
[1:06:55] up the
[1:06:57] they need to store up the
[1:06:59] word that word that we have as the
[1:07:02] message of the glory to
[1:07:05] God so that he can deliver the people
[1:07:08] from
[1:07:10] sin so when God spoke to
[1:07:13] Noah to build an
[1:07:15] ark the people never pay
[1:07:20] attention Noah was building the
[1:07:23] ark it took
[1:07:26] years so many
[1:07:29] years and people are making for we're
[1:07:31] making fun of him it's a story that you
[1:07:35] all are
[1:07:37] with but all I wanted to point out is
[1:07:39] the infallibility of the word of God so
[1:07:42] since God already
[1:07:44] spoke that one of these
[1:07:47] days it's going to rain rain came
[1:07:51] down and God destroy
[1:07:54] everything except Noah and his
[1:07:58] family and the Beast that the lord gave
[1:08:02] instruction to preserve that species
[1:08:05] amen
[1:08:08] amen the word of God will never
[1:08:11] fail that's why Jesus could even
[1:08:15] says that everything can pass
[1:08:18] away but the word of God will never fail
[1:08:21] amen
[1:08:23] amen in the time of Abra
[1:08:27] when God visited
[1:08:30] Abraham God gave a promise to
[1:08:34] Abraham but it was not the same day he
[1:08:37] gave the promise that Abraham have a
[1:08:40] baby it took a
[1:08:43] while and Abraham was
[1:08:47] patient and the word of God was
[1:08:50] fulfilled in his own
[1:08:54] time and we are under the teaching of
[1:08:58] Joseph if you
[1:09:01] remember Joseph had
[1:09:04] dreams he had
[1:09:08] Visions it's the Lord that gave those
[1:09:10] Vision to
[1:09:12] him when he took those vision and went
[1:09:15] and spoke about when he he told about
[1:09:20] them to his brothers and to his parent
[1:09:25] believe unto
[1:09:27] those and he brought
[1:09:31] jealousy even his own father rebuke
[1:09:36] him so really you talking about me and
[1:09:39] your mother kneeling down before you
[1:09:42] amen
[1:09:45] amen and Joseph CL onto those
[1:09:49] Vision to what God showed to
[1:09:53] him he was always happy
[1:09:57] and you will notice my
[1:09:59] brother that the jealousy of his
[1:10:02] brother they could have taken him and
[1:10:06] put him in a
[1:10:08] pit try to make the word of God
[1:10:11] fair but he never
[1:10:14] worked they tried to kill him never
[1:10:19] worked they sold
[1:10:22] him he went to Egypt
[1:10:25] and from there you know the rest of the
[1:10:29] story they even took him to
[1:10:33] prison that would didn't shake his faith
[1:10:36] at
[1:10:36] all he knew what God showed him amen
[1:10:40] glory to God
[1:10:43] Amen they took him to
[1:10:46] prison and from the prison he came
[1:10:51] out he never even took him away from his
[1:10:54] path
[1:10:57] Vision when they were seeking for
[1:10:59] someone to interpret the
[1:11:01] dreams they call on to
[1:11:04] him but
[1:11:06] notice as the prophet
[1:11:08] stated somebody who has Faith he's
[1:11:12] unmovable amen
[1:11:15] amen the answer of Joseph
[1:11:19] was whoever can interpret the
[1:11:22] dream It's Only God Can inter the dream
[1:11:27] amen but now notice
[1:11:32] now the god that presented in front of
[1:11:36] Phar the god that will interpret the
[1:11:39] dream it is a man by the name of
[1:11:43] Joseph but Joseph said no one knows
[1:11:46] about the dream Only God Can interpret
[1:11:48] the
[1:11:50] dream my brother my
[1:11:53] sister when you have the word of God God
[1:11:56] you are a
[1:11:58] God God
[1:12:00] spoke in the book of
[1:12:03] Psalm that I told you that you are
[1:12:08] God even though you die like

[1:25:19] 1964 the 30th August the
[1:25:23] 30th brother Bram says
[1:25:25] this he said now watch
[1:25:29] Paul picking up stick on the island of I
[1:25:33] believe he was he was in
[1:25:37] chance a snake perhaps a
[1:25:41] m that is a death
[1:25:44] bite he should have fallen down right
[1:25:47] quick
[1:25:51] dead I don't know of no the snake that
[1:25:55] would kill you that quick unless it be a
[1:25:59] m and so he pick up this
[1:26:04] m we know that it's a deadly
[1:26:14] B it just got about just a few breath
[1:26:17] when a m hit you or
[1:26:21] Cobra you got the 5050 chance
[1:26:26] 50 to
[1:26:30] live
[1:26:33] with live with the
[1:26:40] cobra with a yellow Cobra you got about
[1:26:42] 80% to
[1:26:45] die and about 20% to
[1:26:48] leave but with a member you have no per
[1:26:52] you are just dead at all that's
[1:26:57] it because you don't take but just few
[1:27:01] breaths paralyzes the nerve
[1:27:04] system the blood system and everything
[1:27:08] else and you are
[1:27:11] gone
[1:27:15] see but when this
[1:27:18] m in the hand they
[1:27:22] say that man is a wicked man
[1:27:25] perhaps a
[1:27:27] murderer even though he escaped the
[1:27:31] sea he could not escape
[1:27:34] death the gods is going to Revenge
[1:27:38] him like him being a
[1:27:42] murderer Paul
[1:27:45] looked and this snake hanging on his
[1:27:48] hand he just shook it
[1:27:51] off not all excited
[1:27:55] oh Lord help me to do it
[1:27:59] no look at it shook it shook it off in
[1:28:03] the fire and went on up picking up like
[1:28:07] nothing had
[1:28:09] happened they say he shall die just in a
[1:28:12] minute because when the snake bite you
[1:28:15] you are gone but after a
[1:28:19] while time pass Paul didn't
[1:28:25] die or no effect they
[1:28:28] changed and they said he is a
[1:28:32] god that is come down in the form of a
[1:28:35] man amen
[1:28:37] see blessed be the name of the
[1:28:42] Lord tonight my brother my
[1:28:45] sister no matter your
[1:28:49] situation people also will change their
[1:28:51] opinion about you amen amen
[1:28:55] they will change their
[1:28:57] [Applause]
[1:28:59] opinion if you
[1:29:04] notice was in the island of
[1:29:09] M when he came out of the boat the
[1:29:14] Sheep he went in a people a barbarus
[1:29:18] people that's what we read
[1:29:21] tonight when he went there
[1:29:25] bar the barbarus people
[1:29:29] here it's like some country B
[1:29:33] people or the people sometime they could
[1:29:36] they could be not liking
[1:29:40] strangers or people that are not nice
[1:29:43] that are not
[1:29:48] good and when we look at the book of act
[1:29:50] 28 verse2 the Bible says
[1:29:56] and the barbar people showed us no
[1:29:58] little
[1:30:00] kindness so when Paul got
[1:30:04] there they were not too really
[1:30:09] happy the way they receive these
[1:30:13] people I don't know maybe because he was
[1:30:17] raining and he was
[1:30:21] called and that's why they didn't take
[1:30:24] care of
[1:30:25] him that's why the Bible
[1:30:29] says no little
[1:30:33] kindness and they took us closer to a
[1:30:38] fire and it was the fire that
[1:30:42] they because it was raining and it was
[1:30:45] cold now listen
[1:30:51] closely now Paul had gathered a b
[1:30:55] and lay them on the
[1:30:59] fire there are certain obligation
[1:31:02] brothers and sisters of
[1:31:05] life that put
[1:31:09] us to live in a in in a places that you
[1:31:13] find people that are
[1:31:16] barar in other words you must find
[1:31:18] yourself among people that you never
[1:31:21] desire God put that in your path
[1:31:26] when you going to work do you only have
[1:31:29] Mage
[1:31:30] there when you are in the hospital do
[1:31:32] you have
[1:31:34] message when you going to school only
[1:31:36] Christian are in
[1:31:38] school so those are the obligation of
[1:31:41] life God always some put us there in our
[1:31:46] life to go through
[1:31:48] that and Paul found himself in such a
[1:31:51] place he was among barbarous people
[1:31:56] and everybody was trying to warm
[1:31:58] themselves up and when Paul when Paul
[1:32:04] look he looked at the fire the fire was
[1:32:06] not too
[1:32:08] strong and he was not strong enough for
[1:32:17] everybody in other word I cannot be
[1:32:20] among I mean benefit from the fire
[1:32:23] without bringing my own input to it
[1:32:27] bring my own contribution to the fire so
[1:32:31] Paul went and got some stick
[1:32:34] to and watch what happened
[1:32:38] now it is not the snake or I mean the
[1:32:42] stick that Paul brought that had it
[1:32:45] glory to
[1:32:47] God those people were
[1:32:51] there when Paul put the sticks in
[1:32:56] the fire got
[1:32:58] bigger and the heat got really
[1:33:03] strong and the serpent the snake came
[1:33:05] out from the
[1:33:07] fire and now notice with
[1:33:11] me those people were living with a
[1:33:13] danger right
[1:33:14] there they never knew that a m was
[1:33:22] there were not long enough to decode
[1:33:25] that
[1:33:28] member maybe they were not praying
[1:33:33] enough brother say You must read your in
[1:33:37] you must read it in the night before you
[1:33:40] go to bed you
[1:33:41] must you must when
[1:33:45] Paul Paul begin to bring his
[1:33:49] contrib and we can tap it as the input
[1:33:52] of Prayer of prayer into the fire when
[1:33:56] the prayer of fire come demon cannot
[1:33:59] stand and the demon is a snake the devil
[1:34:04] here is a
[1:34:06] snake in other words the sickness you
[1:34:09] have it's a
[1:34:11] demon you have a
[1:34:13] demon probably you not aware you
[1:34:16] seek and these people have a danger they
[1:34:20] were not aware of the
[1:34:22] danger they had a m right there only
[1:34:25] Paul have to come to find it and when
[1:34:28] Paul put his contribution and then the
[1:34:31] fire went up then the snake pop up
[1:34:34] that's why we saw
[1:34:41] this and Paul have GA of and laid them
[1:34:45] on the
[1:34:48] fire and a VAP out of the heat fasten on
[1:34:51] his hand like
[1:34:54] tonight I don't know which sickness you
[1:34:57] have by the fire of Pray by the heat of
[1:35:01] the word of God that snake must come out
[1:35:05] my snake must leave your body that snake
[1:35:08] must leave your life I don't know which
[1:35:11] domain of your

[1:36:43] a lot of danger around them they don't
[1:36:46] even they are not
[1:36:48] aware if Paul was not

[1:42:58] this as you also you
[1:43:02] forget says
[1:43:08] this I gave you the
[1:43:11] power to walk upon the
[1:43:14] snake and the
[1:43:17] Scorpion and upon all the power of the
[1:43:21] enemy and nothing should harm you amen
[1:43:25] amen amen
[1:43:27] amen it's already
[1:43:29] written this
[1:43:32] people but Paul
[1:43:37] knew in Psalm
[1:43:40] 91 verse
[1:43:42] 10 the Bible says
[1:43:51] this they shall no evil be theee neither
[1:43:55] shall any plag come nigh th dwelling
[1:43:58] amen
[1:44:00] [Music]
[1:44:02] amen you might be in a wind or in a
[1:44:06] storm as Paul found himself
[1:44:10] in God already gave us some
[1:44:16] prescription and those prescription are
[1:44:19] his
[1:44:20] word when you cling to those
[1:44:24] prescription nothing will harm you amen
[1:44:28] amen nothing will happen to
[1:44:32] you let me move a little bit
[1:44:35] forward
[1:44:38] Glory blessed be the name of the
[1:44:47] Lord I'm going to read verse
[1:44:51] five and he shook off the Beast Into the
[1:44:55] Fire and felt no
[1:44:59] harm as I said
[1:45:04] it the serpent looked at who caused my
[1:45:08] trouble and he attacked the man to the
[1:45:12] hand of
[1:45:14] Paul and Paul never stood still but he
[1:45:18] shook his
[1:45:20] hand so you are so must shake your
[1:45:25] hand you know the part of the
[1:45:29] body that the snake have bit
[1:45:33] you you know the area that have been
[1:45:37] affected that the snake attack you amen
[1:45:42] amen you must shake that
[1:45:44] area you must shake it
[1:45:47] off because he will go back to the
[1:45:50] fire he will go back to the fire
[1:45:56] verse
[1:45:57] six they look when he should have swen
[1:46:01] or fallen down dead
[1:46:06] suddenly that's what I told you you
[1:46:08] might be around
[1:46:10] people you think they're
[1:46:12] friend or maybe your
[1:46:17] family sometime they are the one waiting
[1:46:20] for a curse to happen to you
[1:46:24] how can they be in the same
[1:46:27] place but for them they were expecting
[1:46:30] to see Paul falling dead so that he can
[1:46:35] die because as we read brother
[1:46:38] brother with the vness of this
[1:46:42] snake only two three few breath you
[1:46:45] go but let me tell you this my
[1:46:48] brother I don't know what no matter that
[1:46:51] sickness
[1:46:54] that problem that you
[1:46:57] have even if your problem usually kill
[1:47:01] people you have a different
[1:47:04] prescription your prescription is you
[1:47:07] will not
[1:47:09] die even if other that
[1:47:13] sickness usually kill people it's a
[1:47:15] death sentence it's not going to be a
[1:47:18] death sentence for you amen
[1:47:23] even if there sicknesses in
[1:47:25] you I don't know the condition it is
[1:47:28] maybe it's
[1:47:29] a maybe it's a
[1:47:32] cancer even some many people die with
[1:47:36] you will not
[1:47:38] die just as Paul was not
[1:47:41] dead we see an
[1:47:43] exception Paul was an
[1:47:47] exception when the snake beat
[1:47:49] him he left the Venom
[1:47:54] so why was
[1:47:55] not the same thing will happen to you if
[1:47:59] you are in the
[1:48:00] hospital even you are in
[1:48:03] Affliction or maybe you here you
[1:48:06] sick or maybe a family member
[1:48:09] sick just bring your
[1:48:12] faith just lift up your
[1:48:15] hand and this hand will
[1:48:19] represent the the stick you going to
[1:48:22] throw in the fire
[1:48:24] it is showing the power of
[1:48:26] God it's going to be remember as a
[1:48:29] prayer that's an offering unto the
[1:48:32] Lord that God is able to burn
[1:48:36] everything even if it's in your
[1:48:39] body in your
[1:48:41] soul in your
[1:48:44] spirit I don't know what kind the
[1:48:46] venomous you have in your
[1:48:49] body maybe you are walking smelling
[1:48:52] medication all
[1:48:55] over even when you go to the bathroom
[1:48:57] you smell
[1:49:02] medication even when you eat you still
[1:49:04] smell medication
[1:49:06] too because they put you under a lot of
[1:49:13] medication when everybody is cold you
[1:49:16] are always hurt because of something in
[1:49:19] your no matter what is happening in your
[1:49:22] back
[1:49:24] God is able tonight to heal you to
[1:49:28] deliver
[1:49:29] you you are not that
[1:49:33] race that can be dying with that
[1:49:36] sickness you not any kind of
[1:49:39] race that can be taken off by any
[1:49:42] situation you're not that kind
[1:49:46] of that can take you because of such a
[1:49:49] problem whatever problem is I don't know
[1:49:53] what it
[1:49:54] is remember you don't belong to that
[1:49:57] race that can be taken off by trouble
[1:50:01] amen you won't
[1:50:04] die your enemy will change their
[1:50:08] opinion they will change their
[1:50:11] opinion what are they saying
[1:50:15] here but after they had looked great for
[1:50:18] a
[1:50:20] while and so no harm come to to
[1:50:24] him they change their
[1:50:27] minds your enemy will change their
[1:50:31] mind in whichever
[1:50:35] domain when they see you failing here
[1:50:38] you're not able to do
[1:50:40] this you're not able to do
[1:50:43] that they will change their
[1:50:46] language because you have a
[1:50:48] God the god that we
[1:50:50] have it's a god of
[1:50:53] Miracle meaning God does things that we
[1:50:57] are not able to do where we are
[1:51:01] St that is where God
[1:51:04] start let me tell you
[1:51:07] something many time we fa because of
[1:51:11] this do you know
[1:51:14] why usually we look at our own
[1:51:19] intelligence we look at our own finan
[1:51:24] when we look at what we
[1:51:26] have we say okay I'm I'm able to do this
[1:51:30] I can reach
[1:51:32] this and as long as you are believing or
[1:51:37] or depending on
[1:51:39] yourself and you are not depending on
[1:51:42] God you will
[1:51:44] fail that's why we
[1:51:46] fail but as the pastor always
[1:51:50] say put your car in you
[1:51:54] meaning
[1:51:55] [Applause]
[1:51:56] what we on the grace of
[1:51:59] God just say this Lord I'm not able to
[1:52:03] do
[1:52:04] this I'm not able to reach this but I'm
[1:52:08] waiting for
[1:52:10] thee and I'm depending on your
[1:52:13] grace when you depend on the grace of
[1:52:18] God the way God will come and change the
[1:52:21] SC
[1:52:22] to take you from where you are to where
[1:52:25] you could never expect it will be a
[1:52:27] testimony for you tonight because he's a
[1:52:31] god of
[1:52:32] mirac God will do things that we are not
[1:52:34] able to
[1:52:36] do he will do things that we are not
[1:52:39] able to do musician you can come
[1:52:42] in I'm sorry because I went up on my
[1:52:46] time I don't think
[1:52:49] so he is the same God tonight
[1:52:54] your enemy will change their
[1:52:56] language they will change their
[1:53:01] language what is the
[1:53:05] problem the PE these people when they
[1:53:07] were living with this
[1:53:09] danger they never kindled the
[1:53:12] fire in Isaiah 42 verse
[1:53:18] 22 and Isaiah 5721
[1:53:27] the Bible says there is no
[1:53:29] peace say my God to the wicked am
[1:53:36] amen but how can the wicked be in peace
[1:53:40] Bes you it means something is not
[1:53:44] correct because the snake was there in
[1:53:48] peace and The Barbarians were
[1:53:51] living but the snake was already a
[1:53:53] danger living there it took Paul to be
[1:53:56] in that place and what did Paul
[1:54:00] do he increased the intensity of the
[1:54:03] fire of the fire like
[1:54:07] tonight in your life
[1:54:10] tonight begin to increase the
[1:54:13] fire increase your
[1:54:15] pray your
[1:54:18] your and you will see that snake coming
[1:54:21] out
[1:54:23] that snake that is sitting in your life
[1:54:26] in the domain of your life on your
[1:54:29] business on your in your children or
[1:54:32] whatever it is sitting in or what is
[1:54:34] troubling you that snake will come out
[1:54:38] that snake will come out and he will be
[1:54:41] burned because the Bible
[1:54:44] says the Bible
[1:54:46] says that the fire
[1:54:53] consum the fire will burn continually
[1:54:57] upon the
[1:54:58] altar upon the
[1:55:01] altar so meaning upon the altar of the
[1:55:04] lord we must have fire continually in
[1:55:07] other
[1:55:09] words in the morning you read your Bible
[1:55:12] you start
[1:55:13] praying and then you get some fire at no
[1:55:17] you pray no matter where you
[1:55:20] are you just remember to
[1:55:23] pray anytime you going to be on
[1:55:27] fire and when the fire is
[1:55:30] kindled the enemy cannot stand the enemy
[1:55:33] cannot come near that tonight you must
[1:55:37] remember that you are a child of God you
[1:55:40] are a
[1:55:42] God and your enemy must change your
[1:55:44] testimony they must say that this is a
[1:55:48] god they spoke for Paul that Paul was a
[1:55:51] god God bless
[1:55:53] [Applause]
[1:56:09] [Music]
[1:56:10] you
[1:56:12] amen
[1:56:13] amen glory be to the name of the
[1:56:17] [Music]
[1:56:20] Lord Glory to
[1:56:26] God I believe the Lord spoke to each
[1:56:28] person
[1:56:29] tonight amen Paul got into this
[1:56:34] island he never planned about
[1:56:37] it they got a
[1:56:40] shipwreck and he didn't know he was
[1:56:42] going to that island and if you read the
[1:56:46] rest of the story Paul even ministered
[1:56:49] to the people in that island and the
[1:56:51] people begin to get
[1:56:53] healed it was God path to take him
[1:56:56] through that it looks like it's a
[1:56:59] shipwreck it looks like it's trial after
[1:57:02] trial we got the vision we're going to
[1:57:05] appear before
[1:57:07] Caesar but 14 days no night no moon no
[1:57:12] star under a storm and a
[1:57:15] shipwreck and after shipwreck you are
[1:57:18] saved you say Lord let me breathe a
[1:57:20] little bit
[1:57:24] and you get there you find some barbarus
[1:57:27] people that were nice the Bible says and
[1:57:30] they Kindle the fire for
[1:57:33] you you say praise be to the name of the
[1:57:36] Lord you are Jehovah

[1:58:11] wrong have I se somewhere that's right
[1:58:14] that's right maybe there is a sin that I
[1:58:17] have not
[1:58:18] confessed but I remember confessing
[1:58:21] everything I remember even telling you
[1:58:24] God that if there is anything that I
[1:58:26] forgot that I don't remember forgive me
[1:58:30] because I can't recall everything that I
[1:58:32] have
[1:58:32] done you have not done
[1:58:35] anything God is in
[1:58:37] control amen that snake was a
[1:58:41] danger and that snake is taken care of
