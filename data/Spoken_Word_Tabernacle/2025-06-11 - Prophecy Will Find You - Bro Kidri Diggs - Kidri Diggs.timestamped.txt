[51:07] you know our prophet says sometimes
[51:09] we'll see what God has done and what God

[51:47] brother. Amen. But we love the Lord.
[51:49] Let's just have a word of prayer and
[51:50] we'll get right into the word of God
[51:52] tonight. If you have a need, you can
[51:53] acknowledge to the Lord by uplifted
[51:55] hand. Let's pray. Lord Jesus, Father, we
[51:58] are counted a privilege to be in the
[52:00] house of God. Amen. Lord, in a place
[52:03] that we know has been dedicated for your
[52:05] use, Lord, for your voice, your
[52:07] presence, your touch, everything that
[52:10] you are, Lord, we want to experience,
[52:12] Lord, when we come together as
[52:14] believers. Amen. And Lord God, we bind
[52:16] any spirit that's not like you, any
[52:18] thought that's not like your thoughts,
[52:20] Lord. Any ways that's not like your
[52:22] ways, Lord. And Lord, we pray that that
[52:24] atoning blood would atone for anything
[52:27] that we've done today, Lord. or
[52:29] anything, Lord, that's out of character,
[52:31] Lord. We pray that that blood will
[52:33] continue to purge and sanctify us into
[52:36] the image of your mind and your
[52:38] thoughts, Lord, and what you have for
[52:39] us, Lord. We just pray tonight, Lord
[52:41] God, that in hearing, Lord, they may
[52:44] hear what the spirit is saying, Lord,
[52:46] and see, Lord, and understand, Father.
[52:48] And most of all, Lord, help us to walk
[52:50] in the word. We don't just want to be
[52:52] hearers, but we want to walk in the
[52:54] word, Lord. Lord, we want to become,
[52:56] Lord, the very things that we're
[52:58] hearing, Lord. And Lord, we'll give you
[53:01] all the honor and glory, Lord, in the
[53:04] precious and master's name of Jesus
[53:06] Christ, we pray. Let the church say,
[53:07] "Amen." Amen. Amen. If you have your
[53:10] Bibles, let's turn to Matthew chapter
[53:13] 24.
[53:15] Matthew 24.
[53:25] Um,
[53:28] let's start reading at uh verse three.
[53:30] Matthew 24:E3.
[53:36] If you have say amen. Amen. The Bible
[53:38] says, "And as he sat upon the mount of
[53:40] olives, the disciples came unto him
[53:43] privately, saying, tell us, when shall
[53:46] these things be, and what shall be the
[53:49] sign of thy coming and of the end of the
[53:52] world?" And Jesus answered and said unto
[53:55] them, Take heed that no man deceive you.
[53:59] For many shall come in my name, saying,
[54:02] I am Christ, and shall deceive many, and
[54:06] ye shall hear of wars and rumors of
[54:08] wars. See that ye be not troubled.
[54:12] That's right. For all these things must
[54:14] come to pass, but the end is not yet.
[54:18] For nations shall rise against nations,
[54:20] and kingdoms against kingdoms, and there
[54:24] shall be famines and pestilence, and
[54:26] earthquakes in diverse places. All these
[54:29] are the beginning of sorrow. Then shall
[54:32] they deliver you up to be afflicted and
[54:36] kill you, and ye shall be hated of all
[54:39] nations for my name's sake. And then
[54:42] shall many be offended, and shall betray
[54:46] one another, and shall hate one another,
[54:48] and many false prophets shall rise, and
[54:51] shall deceive many. Amen. Let's turn to
[54:54] um second Peter.
[54:58] Second Peter verse one.
[55:02] Second Peter
[55:05] chapter one. I'm sorry. Chapter one.
[55:10] I think I want verse
[55:18] Let's start at verse uh 18.
[55:24] Second Peter 1.
[55:36] Yeah. Um
[55:40] the Bible says, "And this voice which
[55:43] came from heaven, we heard when we were
[55:47] with him in the holy mount,
[55:50] we have also a more sure word of
[55:54] prophecy,
[55:56] where unto ye do well that ye take heed,
[56:01] as unto a light that shineth in a dark
[56:04] place, unto the day I mean until the day
[56:09] dawn and the day star arise in your
[56:13] hearts. Amen. May the Lord bless the
[56:15] reading of his word. You can have your
[56:17] seats.
[56:19] As we're sitting, I want to I want to
[56:21] read uh one more verse of scripture. Uh
[56:24] Ephesians chapter 5
[56:27] and verse 25. The Bible says, "Husbands,
[56:30] love your wives even as Christ also
[56:32] loved the church and gave himself for it
[56:36] that he might sanctify and cleanse it
[56:39] with the washing of water by the word,
[56:42] that he might present it to himself a
[56:44] glorious church, not having spot or
[56:48] wrinkle or any such thing, but that it
[56:52] should be holy and without blemish."
[56:54] Amen. Tonight, by the grace of God, I
[56:56] want to use for a subject, prophecy will
[56:59] find you.
[57:01] Prophecy will find you. Amen. And you
[57:04] know, uh, if we're all paying attention
[57:06] to what's taking place in our day, we
[57:10] can understand that prophecy is being
[57:12] fulfilled. Hallelujah. It's being
[57:15] fulfilled in our government. It's being
[57:16] fulfilled in our homes, our churches.
[57:19] Wherever we go, we should be able to see
[57:21] that prophecy is being fulfilled. That's
[57:23] right. But let's understand what
[57:25] prophecy is. Prophecy is the foretelling
[57:30] of what's to come. Hallelujah. Prophecy
[57:32] is the foretelling of the future events,
[57:36] maybe in in in the world or even in your
[57:40] life. Hallelujah. But the prophecy we're
[57:42] dealing with is Bible prophecy.
[57:45] Hallelujah. We're not dealing with just
[57:47] whatever anybody may say. We're dealing
[57:50] with something that cannot change.
[57:52] Hallelujah. We're dealing with
[57:54] hallelujah a book of prophecy. And I
[57:58] want everybody to understand that this
[58:00] book of prophecy can't be altered. This
[58:04] book of prophecy will never fail. So
[58:07] whatever we can find in this Bible, we
[58:10] need to hold fast to it. Hallelujah.
[58:13] Hallelujah. There's a lot of churches,
[58:16] there's a lot of uh uh uh worshippers
[58:18] and a lot of people got different gods.
[58:20] Hallelujah. But there's only one book of
[58:23] prophecy.
[58:24] [Applause]
[58:25] The Buddhas don't have it. Hallelujah.
[58:28] The Muslims don't have it. Hallelujah.
[58:30] And on and on of different religions.
[58:33] Hallelujah. But we have a Bible.
[58:36] Hallelujah. That's been ordained before
[58:38] the foundation of the world to show us
[58:41] where we are. Hallelujah. I if you don't
[58:45] mind, I'm going to read a little bit
[58:46] tonight by the grace of God. Now the
[58:48] prophet of God says now the Bible is a
[58:51] different book from any other sacred
[58:53] book. That's right. See there's a lot of
[58:56] sacred books. The Quran and Kaf
[58:59] Confucious and all these other people
[59:01] Buddhism he says but the Bible is a
[59:04] different book. It's a sacred book. Why?
[59:08] It's a book of prophecy that will come
[59:11] to pass. Listen. He says there's no book
[59:14] like the Bible because the Bible is
[59:17] God's word.
[59:21] [Applause]
[59:24] Glory to God.
[59:27] So when we consider this Bible now we
[59:31] going to step out here hallelujah in the
[59:32] plank because there's a lot of things
[59:34] that been said but we want to we want to
[59:37] show and prove what we believe. Now, now
[59:40] uh uh uh we we consider ourselves to be
[59:43] believers of this message. Hallelujah.
[59:45] But our prophet came and told us that
[59:47] the Bible should be your absolute.
[59:54] Hallelujah.
[59:55] And I'mma step way out there. I'm not
[59:58] talking about the New International
[1:00:00] Version.
[1:00:02] [Applause]
[1:00:03] [Music]
[1:00:04] Hallelujah.
[1:00:06] I'm not talking about the make it easy
[1:00:08] version. I'm not talking about the the
[1:00:10] Bible for dummies version. He said the
[1:00:13] closest thing Hallelujah interpreted to
[1:00:16] what God had for us in the beginning is
[1:00:19] the King James version.
[1:00:21] [Applause]
[1:00:22] [Music]
[1:00:27] Yes, sir.
[1:00:29] So be careful what you read.
[1:00:33] Because you you you you can get a Bible
[1:00:36] that doesn't tie in with this message.
[1:00:41] And the Bible and the message is not two
[1:00:44] different things. It's one.
[1:00:48] So while we out here, we going to jump
[1:00:50] on out here. The message is infallible.
[1:00:55] [Applause]
[1:00:58] I'm not talking about the man. I'm
[1:01:00] talking about the word. The word is
[1:01:03] infallible. And the prophet of God said,
[1:01:06] hallelujah, that the Holy Ghost came and
[1:01:08] went, "Oh, I'm Oh my.
[1:01:15] [Applause]
[1:01:16] The reason why we study the message is
[1:01:19] because the message gives me insight on
[1:01:22] the understanding of my Bible.
[1:01:28] God sent a prophet, hallelujah, to open
[1:01:31] up our understanding of what was already
[1:01:34] in the word.
[1:01:36] [Applause]
[1:01:39] Remember, when he opened when God opened
[1:01:42] the seals, the prophet said clearly, it
[1:01:46] has to already be there because you
[1:01:49] can't add to the word of God and you
[1:01:52] can't take away from the word of God.
[1:01:54] Therefore, it had to be a special
[1:01:57] anointing on the person that's
[1:02:00] interpreting the word,
[1:02:04] not just somebody who went to school for
[1:02:06] theology.
[1:02:08] It has to be somebody inspired of God,
[1:02:13] anointed of God.
[1:02:16] Listen, because the Bible is the word of
[1:02:20] God. Hallelujah. So the word of God in
[1:02:23] this Bible is one.
[1:02:26] God is his word. In the beginning was
[1:02:29] the word and the word was with God. Now
[1:02:31] we know that the prophet of God say
[1:02:33] hallelujah. That there were three
[1:02:34] Bibles.
[1:02:38] Hallelujah. He said that there's the
[1:02:41] pyramid. Hallelujah. He said there's the
[1:02:43] zodiac. And then he said there's the
[1:02:45] written Bible. But I challenge you to
[1:02:47] say that there's a fourth one.
[1:02:50] [Applause]
[1:02:53] The Bible says, hallelujah, in
[1:02:56] Corinthians, hallelujah, that is no
[1:02:58] longer written in tables of stones, but
[1:03:00] is written in the fleshly hearts of the
[1:03:03] believer.
[1:03:05] So when you become what you're reading,
[1:03:08] you become the word.
[1:03:14] He drops on down and he says the word
[1:03:17] became flesh. It's not a different
[1:03:19] Bible. It's the same Bible behind badger
[1:03:22] of skin.
[1:03:25] It's not a different message from
[1:03:26] William Brandom. Is the same message
[1:03:29] behind badger of skin.
[1:03:33] [Applause]
[1:03:37] But the problem is
[1:03:39] people don't believe the Bible is the
[1:03:41] absolute.
[1:03:43] That's right. They're looking for
[1:03:45] something to make it easier to
[1:03:47] understand. That hasn't been Hallelujah.
[1:03:50] inspired by devout men of God that God
[1:03:54] chose. So they say, "Well, we're going
[1:03:56] to make a new international version for
[1:03:59] for young people so they can understand
[1:04:01] it."
[1:04:05] He talking to the young people in the
[1:04:07] King James. He said, "We're going to
[1:04:09] make a version for the sisters to be
[1:04:11] able to understand." He talking to the
[1:04:14] sisters in the King James. Say, "We're
[1:04:16] going to make a version so the men can
[1:04:18] be good husbands." He's talking to the
[1:04:20] husbands. Yes, sir.
[1:04:26] Yes sir. Yes sir. What happens is we
[1:04:30] don't have enough people studying their
[1:04:32] message
[1:04:34] [Applause]
[1:04:37] because the study of the message gives
[1:04:39] you understanding of the written word.
[1:04:42] [Applause]
[1:04:42] [Music]
[1:04:45] [Applause]
[1:04:48] My brother let's go. Yes sir. Listen
[1:04:51] what he says.
[1:04:53] He says it's got to come according to
[1:04:57] the word if it comes from God
[1:05:01] because it's to vindicate or prove God's
[1:05:05] presence and he forneew all things being
[1:05:09] by his for fornowledge he ordained
[1:05:12] hallelujah for ordained is called in the
[1:05:15] Bible predestination every age to its
[1:05:19] place so God has showed us according to
[1:05:22] the Bible
[1:05:23] where we are right now. That's why I
[1:05:26] said hallelujah. Prophecy will find you.
[1:05:29] Now, we can look at all the different
[1:05:31] things taking place according to
[1:05:33] prophecy. Let's just start with the with
[1:05:36] the latest thing that is taking place
[1:05:38] based upon what we believe.
[1:05:41] An American pope.
[1:05:44] I'm sure we've been talking about it. An
[1:05:46] American pope prophesied in 1954.
[1:05:53] And after it was prophesied, nine months
[1:05:56] later, this pope was born.
[1:06:02] [Music]
[1:06:08] Could it have been a vindicated Malachi
[1:06:14] Revelation 10:7 prophet
[1:06:18] seeing where he was in time?
[1:06:21] Then he begin to speak the future
[1:06:24] according to what he believed.
[1:06:28] Was to come
[1:06:31] [Applause]
[1:06:35] Oh my my
[1:06:39] listen.
[1:06:40] He said
[1:06:42] every every age to his place and every
[1:06:46] man to his place.
[1:06:49] So according to prophecy, there's some
[1:06:51] place each and every one of us is
[1:06:53] supposed to be.
[1:06:57] You have a place in prophecy. There's a
[1:07:00] word that's been spoken just for you.
[1:07:03] And only you can fulfill it. So that
[1:07:06] word will find you.
[1:07:08] So church, what I love to say,
[1:07:11] Hallelujah. Amen. What I love to say
[1:07:14] when I was born, Hallelujah. The prophet
[1:07:17] of this day wasn't here. But Billy
[1:07:20] Graham was here.
[1:07:22] Hallelujah. Or Roberts was here. They
[1:07:25] didn't have a word of prophecy for my
[1:07:27] life though.
[1:07:31] So their voices didn't mean nothing for
[1:07:33] me. It was a voice of a seventh angel
[1:07:38] that I could connect with. What was it?
[1:07:40] It was a voice of prophecy. Yes, sir.
[1:07:43] That would find me and pull me into the
[1:07:46] lifestyle,
[1:07:48] pull me into the vindication of the word
[1:07:51] I'm supposed to walk in. It's not by
[1:07:55] coincidence. You
[1:07:58] have
[1:08:00] [Applause]
[1:08:02] see
[1:08:04] [Applause]
[1:08:10] what we've done.
[1:08:12] We can easily see
[1:08:14] who and where the prophet is according
[1:08:17] to prophecy.
[1:08:20] Hallelujah.
[1:08:21] But if you can see him, that's right.
[1:08:24] You should be able to see yourself.
[1:08:30] If you can see an American pope, you
[1:08:33] should be able to see where you are.
[1:08:36] If you if you have seen or if you have
[1:08:40] saw Kla Harris in a purple outfit
[1:08:44] standing there vindicating prophecy that
[1:08:47] was spoke about years and years, 1933
[1:08:52] [Music]
[1:08:53] [Applause]
[1:08:59] See, when I see these things coming to
[1:09:01] pass, it don't make me inquire more
[1:09:04] about the pope. It make me inquire more
[1:09:06] about me. Who am I? What am I supposed
[1:09:11] to be doing? Am I ready for a body
[1:09:13] change?
[1:09:18] Because if I can see, hallelujah, a
[1:09:20] spoken word vindicated 71 years later,
[1:09:27] that tells me first of all, I'm in the
[1:09:29] right place.
[1:09:35] There are so many things according to
[1:09:37] prophecy have already happened.
[1:09:40] You know some people are listening to
[1:09:42] the wrong voice or they don't have the
[1:09:45] right understanding.
[1:09:47] That's why God gave us a messenger with
[1:09:49] a message so we'll have the right
[1:09:51] understanding. And people left and they
[1:09:54] say oh prophet said before Billy Paul
[1:09:56] died this going to happen that going to
[1:09:58] happen he old man. Let me let me tell
[1:10:01] you something already happened
[1:10:05] already already happened. The sharks
[1:10:08] have already swam there.
[1:10:10] [Applause]
[1:10:12] People waiting on something that have
[1:10:13] already took place, already happened.
[1:10:18] [Applause]
[1:10:21] [Music]
[1:10:23] There are so many things that he spoke
[1:10:25] about that have already happened. They
[1:10:27] say, "Oh, we waiting for them to open up
[1:10:28] a tent, have a tent vision." Already
[1:10:31] happened. Hallelujah. You What's What is
[1:10:34] that little room? That little room is
[1:10:36] you all along with God behind the veil.
[1:10:40] That's you going back there in the
[1:10:41] Chicago glory. Hallelujah. Remember he
[1:10:44] said it will not be a public show.
[1:10:49] It ain't going to be no building of a
[1:10:51] tent. It's you behind the veil with God.
[1:11:01] It's already found us.
[1:11:05] [Music]
[1:11:07] [Applause]
[1:11:11] Be careful who you let interpret the
[1:11:13] scriptures.
[1:11:17] Cuz remember he said false prophets will
[1:11:20] arise.
[1:11:21] This one saying that the seven the
[1:11:23] eighth angel, the eighth and a half
[1:11:25] angel, the angel of doves. All this
[1:11:29] nonsense that's not in the scripture. I
[1:11:32] don't see no other angels coming after
[1:11:35] the seventh angel but the mighty one.
[1:11:40] And the mighty one is in his bride. So
[1:11:44] if he comes that mean he's coming back
[1:11:46] for me.
[1:11:49] [Applause]
[1:11:53] [Music]
[1:11:57] Listen.
[1:11:59] He says, "So if we can see by the by his
[1:12:02] word what age and what time we're
[1:12:05] living, you'll see it right here in the
[1:12:08] Bible."
[1:12:10] [Applause]
[1:12:11] Revelations 13 is who? America.
[1:12:15] Right in the Bible. Hallelujah. The
[1:12:18] Bible says, hallelujah. That the leaders
[1:12:20] of the world will give the authority to
[1:12:23] it.
[1:12:24] Give it to them. Every time they meet,
[1:12:27] what they do? They bow down and worship
[1:12:29] him, giving him the authority
[1:12:32] of their kingdom.
[1:12:36] Stay right there. Look, sir, we know
[1:12:40] these things. Hallelujah. But I think
[1:12:43] we're concentrating too much on what the
[1:12:46] devil is doing.
[1:12:50] See, the pope, the devil, all that
[1:12:52] prophecy is the mounting up of the mark
[1:12:54] of the beast. But if I can see the mark
[1:12:56] of the beast forming up,
[1:12:59] [Applause]
[1:13:02] I should also see the same life that was
[1:13:05] in the vine that's now in the branches.
[1:13:08] And we should be able to produce the
[1:13:10] same thing that Christ produced,
[1:13:15] brother
[1:13:17] because of prophecy. If you can see the
[1:13:20] devil, listen to me now. Hallelujah. The
[1:13:23] mark of the beast is the devil
[1:13:25] incarnating himself into his one. So if
[1:13:29] we can see the devil about to incarnate.
[1:13:32] [Applause]
[1:13:34] What about God's carnation?
[1:13:38] What about God's carnation?
[1:13:41] How many of you have found your place of
[1:13:43] adoption?
[1:13:47] That's what prophecy should be doing for
[1:13:49] us. We should know our place.
[1:13:55] [Applause]
[1:14:02] I'm not excited about no American pope.
[1:14:06] I'm not excited about Donald Trump. I'm
[1:14:09] excited, hallelujah, about my place.
[1:14:12] Because if I can see the devil come into
[1:14:15] full strength, I should be able to speak
[1:14:18] those things that are not as though they
[1:14:20] are, I should be able to walk up to my
[1:14:24] mountain and say, "Mountain, move, cuz
[1:14:26] I'm a son of God. Move, cuz I'm a son of
[1:14:30] God. Move, cuz I'm a son of God." Yes.
[1:14:39] Listen,
[1:14:40] even in our time,
[1:14:43] songs are coming out that should fulfill
[1:14:46] the prophecy. That's right. There's a
[1:14:48] song called I know who I am.
[1:14:53] a chosen generation
[1:14:57] [Applause]
[1:14:59] called forth to show his excellence.
[1:15:03] [Applause]
[1:15:08] I'm walking in power.
[1:15:10] [Applause]
[1:15:13] [Music]
[1:15:16] I'm producing miracles.
[1:15:23] We got songs identifying who we are.
[1:15:27] That's right.
[1:15:30] But we're looking for the easy life. No,
[1:15:31] we're not looking for the easy life.
[1:15:34] Listen,
[1:15:36] listen what the prophet of God says. I
[1:15:38] want to stick right with it with the
[1:15:40] Bible. Young people, don't get mad at
[1:15:44] mom and daddy.
[1:15:46] We just messengers.
[1:15:49] We're just bringing to you God's word
[1:15:52] and God's word will get you out of here.
[1:15:57] We're just messengers. We're just agents
[1:16:00] of the most high. It ain't our word.
[1:16:03] It's his word. Listen
[1:16:08] [Applause]
[1:16:15] this is what he says
[1:16:17] for all of you who might have a new
[1:16:19] international version.
[1:16:24] We ain't even checking for it in those
[1:16:26] Bibles. They're taking verses out.
[1:16:30] Some of those New International Versions
[1:16:32] don't even have John 1:1 in it.
[1:16:37] Because it's there to water down who God
[1:16:39] is.
[1:16:42] You hear people say, "Uh-uh, you
[1:16:44] religious. I'm spiritual."
[1:16:48] How you spiritual and won't live God's
[1:16:50] word?
[1:16:52] [Applause]
[1:16:54] That's what they consider to be
[1:16:55] spiritual. Oh, I pray. Yeah. But do you
[1:16:57] get answers?
[1:17:01] Do you know him? Prayer is a
[1:17:02] relationship with God.
[1:17:05] Hallelujah.
[1:17:10] Listen. Listen. He says, "Yes, sir."
[1:17:13] Everybody all right? He says, "You will
[1:17:16] recall that I mentioned at the beginning
[1:17:17] of this message that this book we are
[1:17:20] studying is the actual revelation of
[1:17:23] Jesus Christ.
[1:17:24] This Bible, this word of God is the
[1:17:27] revelation of Jesus Christ, the
[1:17:30] understanding of God.
[1:17:35] [Music]
[1:17:37] When we catch it, we catch who God is.
[1:17:41] We begin to understand who he is.
[1:17:44] [Music]
[1:17:46] That's exactly right.
[1:17:50] That's not with knowledge.
[1:17:55] That's with the conversion of the Holy
[1:17:57] Spirit because he hides himself from the
[1:17:59] wise and prudent.
[1:18:02] Listen, he says of this message, this
[1:18:04] book we are studying is the actual
[1:18:06] revelation of Jesus Christ. Jesus
[1:18:08] himself in the church and his work in
[1:18:12] the future ages. So when you see
[1:18:15] Hallelujah and understand this Bible,
[1:18:18] you see Christ in you.
[1:18:21] That's right.
[1:18:23] Which is what?
[1:18:26] See, see what what what has happened.
[1:18:28] Hallelujah. What has happened, brother
[1:18:30] Shimbo? Yes, sir. We read the message
[1:18:33] and we look at it say, "Man, that's a
[1:18:35] nice title.
[1:18:37] It's not a title.
[1:18:40] It's an event taking place on earth.
[1:18:46] The mighty God unveiled."
[1:18:50] That didn't happen in heaven. That
[1:18:52] happened on earth.
[1:18:54] He was unveiled on earth. Christ the
[1:18:58] mystery of God revealed.
[1:19:01] Where was he revealed? On earth.
[1:19:04] Cuz the just of that message, he said,
[1:19:06] "What's the mystery?" Christ in you the
[1:19:09] hope of glory.
[1:19:12] He preached a message called the
[1:19:14] contest. Where is the contest taking
[1:19:16] place? Yes, sir. He preached a message
[1:19:20] called the oddball. Who are the
[1:19:22] oddballs?
[1:19:25] It's not good titles. It's events taking
[1:19:28] place in the believer's life.
[1:19:33] [Applause]
[1:19:37] Hallelujah.
[1:19:39] Look, he preached a message called God's
[1:19:42] provided place of worship.
[1:19:46] Where is he? Where is his provided
[1:19:48] place? Somebody show me.
[1:19:57] If you think it's the church or the
[1:19:59] tabernacle, you need to go back to your
[1:20:01] Bible cuz God Hallelujah. the prophet
[1:20:04] brought out Moses built the tabernacle
[1:20:07] after a man. He did
[1:20:11] with the three courts. Hallelujah.
[1:20:14] Hallelujah. We are the tabernacle.
[1:20:20] [Applause]
[1:20:26] Listen, what I'm preaching tonight is
[1:20:27] eagle food.
[1:20:29] And if you're not studying, you lost.
[1:20:35] Church, we're about to get out of here.
[1:20:38] You got to know where you at. Prophecy
[1:20:41] will find you.
[1:20:43] You're going to fulfill the good or the
[1:20:45] bad, but you're going to fulfill some of
[1:20:48] it.
[1:20:50] Yes, sir.
[1:20:51] [Music]
[1:20:55] Listen.
[1:20:57] Glory to God. Listen, he says, "Bringing
[1:20:59] these two thoughts together, you will
[1:21:01] see that it won't take just ordinary
[1:21:04] study." No, sir. And thinking to make
[1:21:07] this book real, sir. No, sir. Men have
[1:21:10] studied the Bible for ages and they
[1:21:13] still running for revelation.
[1:21:15] [Applause]
[1:21:20] Do you know even brother Brandham he was
[1:21:24] f to say the white horse rider was God.
[1:21:28] But then God came in.
[1:21:32] God came in and gave him understanding.
[1:21:36] Where was Brother Brandham getting it
[1:21:37] from? He had pulled all the different
[1:21:39] teachers, pull all their thoughts and
[1:21:41] things together and that's what he came
[1:21:43] up with. Hallelujah. The inspiration of
[1:21:46] men will always lead you wrong.
[1:21:50] [Applause]
[1:21:59] Yes sir. Yes sir.
[1:22:04] Listen.
[1:22:06] He says it's going to take the operation
[1:22:08] of the Holy Spirit. That means this book
[1:22:12] can't be revealed to anyone but a
[1:22:15] special class of people.
[1:22:18] Yes sir.
[1:22:20] Come on church. Yes sir. A special class
[1:22:23] of people.
[1:22:25] A holy nation.
[1:22:28] A royal priesthood, a peculiar people,
[1:22:33] special class of people.
[1:22:38] [Applause]
[1:22:42] It's like y'all y'all y'all a bunch of
[1:22:43] fanatics. You following the man know I'm
[1:22:45] special.
[1:22:48] You can't see what I see.
[1:22:51] You see a white horse rider. I said,
[1:22:53] "Yeah, but I see he ain't got no arrows.
[1:22:56] Listen up. He got a Ba. He ain't got no
[1:23:00] arrows. A special class of people.
[1:23:08] That's right. We not afraid of the white
[1:23:10] horse rider cuz he got a bow and no
[1:23:14] arrows. That mean he can't do us no
[1:23:16] harm.
[1:23:19] [Applause]
[1:23:31] Look church, a special class of people,
[1:23:35] it will take one with prophetic insight.
[1:23:41] [Applause]
[1:23:42] So if you are understanding this
[1:23:44] message, it's because you have been
[1:23:46] giving prophetic insight.
[1:23:49] [Applause]
[1:23:53] Yes, sir. Oh, you thought it was just a
[1:23:55] prophet. No. To understand what the
[1:23:57] prophet is talking about, you have to be
[1:23:59] of the same caliber.
[1:24:03] You have to be of the same spiritual
[1:24:05] DNA.
[1:24:08] You have to have the same touch from
[1:24:10] God.
[1:24:22] That's why in Revelation 10, the mighty
[1:24:25] angel came down to meet the seventh
[1:24:28] angel. All of this was happening on
[1:24:30] earth, not in heaven, on earth. God came
[1:24:34] down, gave the book to the seventh
[1:24:35] angel. Hallelujah. Told him, "Eat it.
[1:24:38] Open it up." But who did the seventh
[1:24:40] angel give the book to?
[1:24:43] [Applause]
[1:24:48] If you studying this message, you are
[1:24:50] eating of the same revelation that the
[1:24:53] seventh angel had.
[1:24:57] That came from God.
[1:25:00] That's why we can see him 107.
[1:25:02] Hallelujah. But we are 8 through 11.
[1:25:05] That's right. Hallelujah. Cuz we eat the
[1:25:07] book. Hallelujah. It's bitter of sweet
[1:25:09] everything that the scriptures say. But
[1:25:11] it also says, "Thou must prophesy
[1:25:13] again."
[1:25:15] It ain't It ain't the seventh angel
[1:25:18] riding that trail. It's the bride of
[1:25:21] Christ.
[1:25:25] [Applause]
[1:25:30] [Music]
[1:25:32] The only way you put it back on the
[1:25:33] prophet is because you don't see
[1:25:34] yourself in the scripture.
[1:25:37] You got to see yourself in the
[1:25:39] scripture. Hallelujah. It do me no good
[1:25:42] to see who my messenger.
[1:25:47] [Applause]
[1:25:50] Look, Brother Diggs, where are we? I
[1:25:52] ain't going to be too much longer. Where
[1:25:54] are we? I want you to understand
[1:25:57] something. It's high time for us to
[1:26:00] produce what we've been reading all
[1:26:01] these years.
[1:26:06] It's time for us to produce this
[1:26:07] message.
[1:26:09] Hallelujah.
[1:26:11] Because there's a prophecy and then
[1:26:13] there's a manifestation of that
[1:26:14] prophecy.
[1:26:17] Yes, sir.
[1:26:20] Yes, sir.
[1:26:23] Yes,
[1:26:24] sir. He said, "Not just," he say, "It
[1:26:27] will require supernatural instruction."
[1:26:30] Not just a student comparing verse with
[1:26:33] verse. That's not preaching. You saying,
[1:26:36] "I'm called just to go through the Bible
[1:26:38] and turn to the front and compare this
[1:26:40] verse with that verse." No, there has to
[1:26:43] be supernatural instruction,
[1:26:45] inspiration from God.
[1:26:55] Yes, sir. The problem is we got too many
[1:26:57] men who are really exorters.
[1:27:01] [Applause]
[1:27:03] They're exorters. And because they have
[1:27:05] understanding, they think they're
[1:27:07] preachers. Hallelujah. But preaching
[1:27:10] requires a gift,
[1:27:12] [Music]
[1:27:14] not knowledge of turning scripture to
[1:27:16] little scripture. You have to get out of
[1:27:18] the way so God can use your gift.
[1:27:27] Just because you understand the message
[1:27:29] doesn't mean you're called to preach.
[1:27:31] [Applause]
[1:27:37] Listen,
[1:27:42] [Music]
[1:27:45] he says not just a student comparing
[1:27:47] verse with verse, though that is good,
[1:27:51] but a mystery requires the teaching of
[1:27:55] the spirit or it never becomes clear.
[1:28:05] And let me say this, hallelujah. The
[1:28:08] message of the hour should no longer be
[1:28:10] a mystery to you.
[1:28:16] The prophet has been revealed.
[1:28:18] God has been revealed. The bride has
[1:28:21] been revealed.
[1:28:24] [Music]
[1:28:25] So if you're looking for a a ministry to
[1:28:28] preach things in mystery form where you
[1:28:30] be like, "Oh, wow.
[1:28:32] Man, that was powerful. It was so
[1:28:34] powerful I didn't understand it. He not
[1:28:37] have preached it accordingly.
[1:28:39] He's not supposed to be preaching you a
[1:28:41] mystery. It's been revealed.
[1:28:44] So if it's a true gift, it'll make it
[1:28:47] clear.
[1:28:51] You'll be streaming, pastor, preacher,
[1:28:55] give me more cuz I understand it. That's
[1:28:57] exactly right, brother.
[1:29:02] If he's preaching this message and you
[1:29:03] don't understand it, that's not a true
[1:29:05] gift. No, it's not.
[1:29:09] Cuz God didn't use a man to confuse you.
[1:29:12] He used a man that couldn't mess it up.
[1:29:18] [Applause]
[1:29:23] He said, "But the mystery requires the
[1:29:25] teaching of the spirit or it never
[1:29:27] becomes clear." That's right. So church,
[1:29:29] what we have to do is find out where we
[1:29:31] are. That's right. See, there's a
[1:29:33] prophecy and then there's a
[1:29:34] manifestation of that prophecy
[1:29:37] and it has to find you. Hallelujah.
[1:29:40] Remember he said he said that the word
[1:29:42] of God will not return unto him void.
[1:29:44] And spoken word is original seed. He
[1:29:47] said he said that voice goes out there.
[1:29:50] Yes, sir. And it stays out there until
[1:29:52] it finds its resting place.
[1:29:56] [Applause]
[1:30:02] And in another place he said the Holy
[1:30:04] Spirit is like that mother eagle who
[1:30:07] knew how many eggs she had. He said and
[1:30:10] what she does is she searches for that
[1:30:13] other life and she doesn't stop because
[1:30:15] she knows how many eggs she's had. If
[1:30:18] you belong to God, God's not going to
[1:30:21] rest until you get the Holy Spirit.
[1:30:24] That's nothing.
[1:30:27] Yes, my brother.
[1:30:29] See, what do we have? We have
[1:30:32] Hallelujah.
[1:30:34] A changing of the God. But the changing
[1:30:37] of the God is really the same mantle.
[1:30:40] That's the truth, brother.
[1:30:43] [Applause]
[1:30:44] It's not a different mantle. It's the
[1:30:47] same mantle.
[1:30:49] When two gods change places, this God
[1:30:52] don't go stand over here. No, he stands
[1:30:54] in the same spot
[1:30:57] guarding the same thing. And you know
[1:30:59] what, church? Hallelujah. We should see
[1:31:02] more of this message in our lives. You
[1:31:05] know what? I I like the I like the
[1:31:07] thought of Hallelujah. When Adam and Eve
[1:31:10] was kicked out, he put a seraphim there.
[1:31:14] Hallelujah. Guarding the way with a
[1:31:16] flaming sword. But in our day,
[1:31:21] we had a prophet who was given a sword.
[1:31:25] [Applause]
[1:31:26] So, we got the sword in time that stops
[1:31:30] it from moving that we can get back
[1:31:32] there now.
[1:31:36] We're back there behind that veil.
[1:31:41] [Music]
[1:31:45] Hallelujah.
[1:31:47] He also called that sword a strong hand
[1:31:50] of faith.
[1:31:53] [Music]
[1:31:55] Listen, let me run this down real quick
[1:31:58] so we can get out of here.
[1:32:01] You got to preach.
[1:32:03] Prophecy will find you.
[1:32:06] Because if prophecy spoke and found the
[1:32:09] pope for our day, will you know prophecy
[1:32:12] even found Barack Obama?
[1:32:16] That's right.
[1:32:20] The scripture says, hallelujah, just
[1:32:23] like it was in the days of Sodom, Luke
[1:32:25] 17. Yes, sir. Just like it was in the
[1:32:28] days of Noah. Yes, sir. God Oh, y'all
[1:32:30] might y'all might not like this. Yes,
[1:32:32] sir. Hallelujah. But God used Barack
[1:32:35] Obama to bring Sodom and Gomorrah on the
[1:32:38] earth and make it legal.
[1:32:47] 2010 2014
[1:32:50] Obama Hallelujah. He took a He made it
[1:32:53] in the military. Don't ask, don't tell.
[1:32:55] It's all right to be a homosexual.
[1:33:01] What was it doing? It was making
[1:33:02] prophecy a manifestation.
[1:33:06] That's right.
[1:33:07] Stay right there. Amen. You say, "Well,
[1:33:11] brother D, it really see people in their
[1:33:12] Bible." They say, "Well, the Bible don't
[1:33:14] really say homosexual,
[1:33:16] [Applause]
[1:33:20] the Bible says you shall know them by
[1:33:22] their fruit,
[1:33:25] by their lifestyle."
[1:33:28] Okay. Well, let's let's go down to Sodom
[1:33:30] real quick.
[1:33:33] The angels come down. Hallelujah. come
[1:33:36] down to lighthouse because the iniquity,
[1:33:38] the sin, the smell of it reached up to
[1:33:40] God. And God said, "I'mma destroy that
[1:33:43] place because of the wickedness." What
[1:33:46] was the wickedness?
[1:33:51] Those handsome, glorious
[1:33:54] angels come down walking through the
[1:33:57] city. Men that have never been touched.
[1:34:01] Men that know no wrong. No tattoos, pure
[1:34:05] skin, didn't even need a tan, eyes
[1:34:08] clear, didn't even need no visine.
[1:34:15] Walked into Lot's house. And the men of
[1:34:17] the city never saw men like that before.
[1:34:20] And when they saw those men, they ran to
[1:34:23] Lot's house, baming on the door. And the
[1:34:26] Bible says, the Bible, the Bible says
[1:34:30] that those men said, "Give us those
[1:34:33] men."
[1:34:38] It's in your Bible.
[1:34:41] Give us those men and you look at you
[1:34:44] look at Lot's response to them. Why did
[1:34:48] he respond like this? His response was,
[1:34:52] "I have two daughters.
[1:34:55] that have never been touched.
[1:34:59] [Applause]
[1:35:03] He said, "I got two daughters."
[1:35:05] Basically, why do you want those men?
[1:35:07] That's exactly right.
[1:35:10] I got two daughters who've never been
[1:35:12] touched. And you know what they said? We
[1:35:14] don't want them. Give us those men.
[1:35:17] [Music]
[1:35:23] Amen. Read your Bible. It's in your
[1:35:25] Bible.
[1:35:27] Homosexuality.
[1:35:28] [Applause]
[1:35:30] [Music]
[1:35:32] And if it was okay, just what they were
[1:35:36] saying, give us those men. Make God
[1:35:38] angry. And God smoked them blind.
[1:35:43] That's right. Yes, sir. Take your time,
[1:35:45] my brother.
[1:35:47] [Applause]
[1:35:50] Take your time. The Bible say man should
[1:35:53] not lay with mankind.
[1:35:56] Woman should not lay with womankind.
[1:35:59] That's what the Bible says. Period.
[1:36:02] That's why this the scripture says stay
[1:36:04] away from false prophets, false
[1:36:07] teachers. There's a well-known preacher
[1:36:10] down there. I ain't going to tell where
[1:36:11] you from, but got a big church. 30,
[1:36:14] 40,000 people. Get up there every
[1:36:17] morning. This is my Bible.
[1:36:21] It is what it is. I can do what it says
[1:36:24] I can do. This is my Bible.
[1:36:29] The man had an interview and in the
[1:36:31] interview the interviewer asked him say,
[1:36:34] "Do you believe in the second coming of
[1:36:36] God?"
[1:36:38] He says, "Well,
[1:36:42] this is your Bible and you don't believe
[1:36:44] the Lord is coming back.
[1:36:48] false teachers, false prophets.
[1:36:53] In the same interview, the man also
[1:36:56] asked him, this pastor of this big, big
[1:36:59] church, he asked me said, "Well, what do
[1:37:01] you think about homosexuality?" He says,
[1:37:02] "Well, it's definitely not God's best.
[1:37:08] God's best. God ain't got nothing to do
[1:37:11] with it.
[1:37:15] That's it.
[1:37:17] That's it.
[1:37:19] That's it.
[1:37:22] False prophets, false teachers, sir. But
[1:37:25] that's not the end. Church, we got a war
[1:37:28] right now in Ukraine and Russia taking
[1:37:30] place is happening. Yes, sir.
[1:37:32] Hallelujah. Like I say, Obama rose up to
[1:37:34] fulfill prophecy. Hallelujah. To give
[1:37:37] the gays the rights that they need.
[1:37:38] Hallelujah. Obama also sided.
[1:37:41] Hallelujah. He also sided with the
[1:37:43] Supreme Court to make same-sex marriages
[1:37:46] okay.
[1:37:48] Yo, black president.
[1:37:58] They put the black man in office to
[1:38:00] fulfill the scripture. Hallelujah. Of
[1:38:03] homosexual rights.
[1:38:07] Obama. Obama. Obama. Obama. You better
[1:38:10] be careful what you cheering for.
[1:38:15] [Applause]
[1:38:21] Democrat or Republican, you better be
[1:38:23] for Christ and Christ alone.
[1:38:29] [Applause]
[1:38:33] Then he he leaves office. Trump gets in.
[1:38:37] Uh-huh. Right. The Bible says that
[1:38:40] there'll be famines and pestilence in
[1:38:42] the land. Hallelujah. We just had a
[1:38:46] famine of what? Eggs.
[1:38:52] People flooding, rushing to the stores.
[1:38:53] Oh, I got to get these eggs. The eggs
[1:38:55] got salmonella and all. Oh, it's a
[1:38:57] famine. The Bible said it was going to
[1:38:59] happen.
[1:39:02] But also pestilence.
[1:39:05] That word pestilence deals with plagues.
[1:39:11] We had one of the greatest plagues in
[1:39:13] our day of all time
[1:39:16] called COVID 19.
[1:39:19] Prophecy has been fulfilled.
[1:39:22] And what brother Shimbo, what we fail to
[1:39:24] realize, hallelujah, that these these
[1:39:26] things happened to fulfill prophecy.
[1:39:29] COVID 19 was just a forerun of a world
[1:39:32] one government. Cuz
[1:39:36] remember to say the whole goal is to
[1:39:38] make this thing a one world government,
[1:39:40] a one world order. What did we see
[1:39:43] doing? Co
[1:39:45] Russia
[1:39:47] was living the same way as the US. Yes,
[1:39:49] sir. The US the same way as Australia.
[1:39:52] Australia, Canada. All you people
[1:39:54] talking about, I ain't wearing no mask.
[1:39:56] Every morning you got up. That's right.
[1:39:59] Uh-huh.
[1:40:02] If you wanted to go to work, mask up.
[1:40:08] One world government.
[1:40:11] We already seen a preview of it.
[1:40:15] Amen.
[1:40:17] You couldn't travel unless you got a
[1:40:19] shot. Amen.
[1:40:23] Yes, sir. Where are we?
[1:40:27] And that's been now what? two years ago,
[1:40:30] three years ago, something like that,
[1:40:32] four years ago. You see how fast it goes
[1:40:35] and then we we we go right back to
[1:40:37] normal.
[1:40:40] We we go right back to normal. Well, I
[1:40:43] don't know if I'm going to make it
[1:40:44] tonight. Gas then went up. It's going to
[1:40:47] keep going up. Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
[1:40:57] Brother Kelly, Brother Kelly, they
[1:40:58] better be glad I ain't a pastor cuz I'll
[1:41:01] say take the streaming down.
[1:41:05] Bring your behind the church. Take the
[1:41:07] streaming down.
[1:41:09] Come on and hear this word.
[1:41:13] That's why I'm not a pastor.
[1:41:16] Yes, sir.
[1:41:18] Pastor has compassion for your lack of
[1:41:22] God.
[1:41:25] [Applause]
[1:41:28] An evangelist. He just shoots and blasts
[1:41:30] to you dead.
[1:41:33] I don't have time to be worried about
[1:41:35] your feelings. I'm here to destroy the
[1:41:38] devil.
[1:41:41] I'm here to tell the devil, whatever you
[1:41:43] are, cancer, diabetes, sadness, pain,
[1:41:48] heartache, hallelujah, we got power over
[1:41:51] you.
[1:41:53] Cuz I know who I am.
[1:41:56] [Applause]
[1:42:02] [Music]
[1:42:02] [Applause]
[1:42:03] Lord, there's a prophecy and a
[1:42:05] manifestation.
[1:42:07] Hallelujah. And we can see even in our
[1:42:08] own government the predesty things are
[1:42:11] taking place. Listen church. And even
[1:42:15] you say, "Well, brother D, what's
[1:42:16] happened?" Hallelujah. If you we we just
[1:42:19] tuck Barack, we just tuck uh h uh Trump.
[1:42:22] Let's hit slow Joe real quick.
[1:42:26] Slow Joe get in office and can't even
[1:42:28] operate.
[1:42:29] He's in office shaking hands with
[1:42:31] ghosts.
[1:42:35] When he first hallelujah got in the
[1:42:38] office and had the inauguration, the
[1:42:40] first thing he did was had a Catholic
[1:42:42] mask.
[1:42:46] Giving the authority to who?
[1:42:50] And he also was a fulfillment of
[1:42:53] prophecy of prophecy.
[1:42:56] Joe had to get sick.
[1:42:58] So Colama, whatever her name is, Kamala
[1:43:04] could take over office and fulfill what
[1:43:07] brother Brandham said, that a woman in
[1:43:10] purple will rise up in power and take
[1:43:13] over the country. That's exactly right.
[1:43:15] It happened.
[1:43:18] [Applause]
[1:43:18] [Music]
[1:43:23] She was a fulfillment of it. Hallelujah.
[1:43:27] Yes. And these things are taking right
[1:43:30] place right in front of us and we not
[1:43:31] even realize it.
[1:43:35] But enough of that. H look Isaiah 7:14
[1:43:40] it says a virgin shall conceive. That
[1:43:42] was the prophecy. Luke 1:34 was Mary
[1:43:46] being the manifestation of that
[1:43:48] prophecy.
[1:43:50] Hallelujah.
[1:43:52] Years and years later she was a
[1:43:53] manifestation of it. Isaiah 40:3
[1:43:57] it says the voice in the wilderness was
[1:43:59] a prophecy. John 1:23 was a fulfillment
[1:44:03] of that prophecy. They asked John, "Who
[1:44:05] are you?" He said, "I'm the voice of one
[1:44:07] crying in the wilderness."
[1:44:12] Those prophecies found them. Hallelujah.
[1:44:17] Deuteronomy 18 and 15, the Lord shall
[1:44:19] raise up a prophet. That's Moses talking
[1:44:22] in prophecy. Matthew 17 and5 here ye him
[1:44:26] Jesus Christ was the manifestation of
[1:44:28] that prophecy
[1:44:30] [Applause]
[1:44:33] oh my I'm running out of time
[1:44:38] and like I just said like I just quoted
[1:44:40] Yes sir Luke 17:30 26-30 the days of
[1:44:44] Noah and Lot the prophecy Obama was a
[1:44:47] fulfillment of that Trump was a
[1:44:49] fulfillment of that hallelujah Biden was
[1:44:51] a fulfillment of at Hallelujah. All
[1:44:53] these things took place within the last
[1:44:55] eight years. Yes, sir. Amen. Where are
[1:44:59] we?
[1:45:04] Where are we? Yes, sir. We have a more
[1:45:06] sure word of prophecy. But listen, if we
[1:45:10] can see all that taking place, Yes, sir.
[1:45:13] what else should we be seeing?
[1:45:15] [Applause]
[1:45:18] What should we be seeing?
[1:45:20] Hallelujah. Yes, sir. What should be
[1:45:22] taking place? Yes, sir. Hallelujah. The
[1:45:25] seals have been revealed.
[1:45:27] Hallelujah.
[1:45:29] I'm not in the first seal. I'm not in
[1:45:32] the first four. That's the Antichrist.
[1:45:35] I'm not in the fifth seal. That's the
[1:45:36] souls under the altar. I'm not in the
[1:45:39] six seals. That's the Jews. So, where am
[1:45:41] I?
[1:45:45] Where are you, church?
[1:45:48] You are that seventh seal.
[1:45:56] Hallelujah.
[1:46:01] You are once you realize where you are,
[1:46:06] you become the living manifestation
[1:46:09] of the opening of the word.
[1:46:13] [Applause]
[1:46:17] Amen.
[1:46:19] Listen, before I get out of here, the
[1:46:21] prophet says, he says, "Now,
[1:46:25] here is what I'm trying to say to you.
[1:46:28] The law of reproduction,
[1:46:31] bring forth of its own kind."
[1:46:34] Genesis 1:11.
[1:46:36] These last days, true church, bride
[1:46:40] comes to the headstone
[1:46:43] will be the super church.
[1:46:48] [Applause]
[1:46:53] As she's nearing the headstone,
[1:46:56] she will be a super church. Amen. Now,
[1:47:00] that was prophesied back in 1962.
[1:47:07] We see the fulfillment of the pope. We
[1:47:10] see the fulfillment of the Catholic
[1:47:11] Church. We see the fulfillment of all
[1:47:13] the presidents. Where are you?
[1:47:18] Where is that super church?
[1:47:23] [Applause]
[1:47:23] [Music]
[1:47:26] You have a right to fulfill the
[1:47:28] prophecy.
[1:47:33] He said they will be much like him, so
[1:47:35] much like him. Even they will be in his
[1:47:38] very image.
[1:47:40] In the order to be united with him, they
[1:47:43] will be one. Amen.
[1:47:46] [Applause]
[1:47:48] Amen. That's who we are. And when the
[1:47:51] church is redeemed and rise in the
[1:47:52] resurrection, we are the bride of
[1:47:55] Christ. I say that reverely hoping we
[1:47:58] are believing we are by faith. We are
[1:48:00] the bride of Jesus Christ will have the
[1:48:03] same spirit in it. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:48:09] Yes, my brother. The same
[1:48:13] spirit. Yes, sir.
[1:48:15] Not a different Jesus.
[1:48:19] The same Jesus.
[1:48:22] Not a different What is the Holy Ghost?
[1:48:25] The Holy Ghost is the person of Christ
[1:48:28] living in you. And you mean to tell me I
[1:48:31] got Christ in me and I ain't got enough
[1:48:33] faith, hallelujah, for God to pay a
[1:48:35] bill?
[1:48:38] You mean to tell me I ain't got enough
[1:48:40] faith for a blood issue?
[1:48:44] [Music]
[1:48:45] If Christ is in you, it's the same God.
[1:48:51] [Applause]
[1:48:54] The prophet said, "Real revival is
[1:48:56] seeing your enemy and seeing God."
[1:49:01] Hallelujah. He says, "Now watch." He He
[1:49:03] said,
[1:49:04] "Give me this last one and I'll move out
[1:49:06] the way." He says, "Now watch what
[1:49:10] happened." Yes, sir. Now when his father
[1:49:13] after this child had been born in the
[1:49:15] family yet he did not inherit anything
[1:49:18] until his life proved out to be the
[1:49:21] right kind of a child and the tutor
[1:49:25] which is the Holy Spirit in our case
[1:49:28] brought word to the father all the time
[1:49:31] how this child was progressing. Now
[1:49:34] we're tried to jump the fence.
[1:49:39] You can't jump the fence. You got to
[1:49:41] walk through the gate. Hallelujah. When
[1:49:44] when we've tried to stick the cart
[1:49:46] before the horse, you tried to claim
[1:49:49] things and do things before God did it
[1:49:52] and got a got a lot of flesh work up
[1:49:55] into it. And that's what's the matter
[1:49:57] with the church. If real Pentecost of
[1:50:00] faith settled over the audience of the
[1:50:02] size of this size, brother, all
[1:50:05] California, Yes, sir. all Gastonia
[1:50:09] would know something happened up here
[1:50:11] tonight. He said real Pentecost of
[1:50:14] faith. Amen. If real Pentecost of faith
[1:50:18] would fall in this church tonight. Yes,
[1:50:20] sir. Amen.
[1:50:22] Everybody in Gastonia would know.
[1:50:26] He said there's something wrong. It
[1:50:28] isn't wrong with God. It isn't wrong
[1:50:31] with your faith. Catch it now. It is. It
[1:50:35] isn't wrong with God. It isn't wrong
[1:50:37] with your faith. It's being placed
[1:50:40] right.
[1:50:48] See, where are we? We're in the spot of
[1:50:51] adoption now.
[1:50:53] Yes, sir. There's enough faith in the
[1:50:56] church. Hallelujah. To create a world,
[1:50:59] live in it. But the thing of it is is
[1:51:01] too many of us are out of place.
[1:51:07] Once we get in place, God will do what
[1:51:09] he's always done.
[1:51:12] Adoption is your placing. Is not the
[1:51:14] Holy Spirit. No sir. No sir. No sir.
[1:51:17] It's not the Holy Spirit. Adoption is
[1:51:19] God using you divinely for what he
[1:51:22] created you for.
[1:51:32] He said it's being place right, knowing
[1:51:34] what you're doing and how to do it.
[1:51:37] That's the secret of the whole thing and
[1:51:40] then yielding yourself to the will of
[1:51:42] God,
[1:51:45] Lord. I tell you, it's in the Bible.
[1:51:49] Yes, sir. Amen. When you go and read,
[1:51:50] and I'm and I'm about to close. When you
[1:51:52] go and read the first introduction
[1:51:54] between Elijah and Elisha, when they
[1:51:58] first met, Elijah threw the mantle on
[1:52:00] him.
[1:52:03] That's exactly right. When he was a
[1:52:04] baby, he had potential to be a prophet.
[1:52:10] [Applause]
[1:52:12] When he was a baby, he had potential to
[1:52:15] fulfill what the prophet was doing, but
[1:52:18] he had to grow into it. That's why the
[1:52:20] prophet, hallelujah, told to Osborne,
[1:52:22] hallelujah, you can do it. Just go sit
[1:52:24] under that oak tree.
[1:52:27] And that's what's wrong with people.
[1:52:28] They don't want to sit under the oak
[1:52:30] tree. God give you a pastor. That's the
[1:52:32] oak tree. Sit up under that. Stop
[1:52:34] watching, listen to all these other
[1:52:36] pastors this and that. Then you go back
[1:52:38] and compare. This pastor said that, that
[1:52:40] pastor said, "Sit up under your oak
[1:52:42] tree.
[1:52:45] [Music]
[1:52:46] [Applause]
[1:52:50] [Music]
[1:52:52] a little bit harder. He set up under the
[1:52:55] ministry of Elijah.
[1:52:57] Yes, sir. And he saw so much done to
[1:53:00] win. Elijah was ready to move on. He
[1:53:03] said, "Hey, I got the cross over here.
[1:53:05] You stay here." He say, "As thy soul
[1:53:08] liveth and the Lord liveth, I will not
[1:53:11] leave thee." Then they crossed over.
[1:53:15] Then they went to Bethl I believe and he
[1:53:17] said I got to go over here and go to
[1:53:19] this. He said as thy soul liveth and the
[1:53:22] Lord liveth I will not leave. Then they
[1:53:24] crossed over.
[1:53:26] But this is the challenge. They got the
[1:53:29] Jordan.
[1:53:30] [Applause]
[1:53:34] Jordan represents death.
[1:53:37] If you want to see God and move in your
[1:53:39] life, you got to die.
[1:53:42] Die to your ways. Die to your thoughts,
[1:53:46] die to your personal feelings.
[1:53:53] Amen.
[1:53:54] But the biggest thing we got to die to
[1:53:57] is our past.
[1:53:59] [Applause]
[1:54:02] Speak, Lord.
[1:54:04] I remember when I was at so and so
[1:54:06] church, we just You ain't at so and so
[1:54:08] church.
[1:54:11] [Applause]
[1:54:15] I remember when the devil so and so stop
[1:54:17] remembering what the devil did.
[1:54:20] Let those unbelieving thoughts follow
[1:54:22] you. Tell the devil stop following me.
[1:54:26] [Music]
[1:54:29] Hallelujah. I'm stepping on new ground.
[1:54:32] Hallelujah.
[1:54:34] But church, here we are. We're here.
[1:54:37] Hallelujah. We're at that spot where we
[1:54:40] should see the mantle changing.
[1:54:43] Amen. Amen. But I love what Elijah say.
[1:54:46] He said, "Hey, you've been following me
[1:54:47] this long." They crossed over Jordan. He
[1:54:49] went over Jordan. He was willing to die.
[1:54:51] Uhhuh. Hallelujah. Every administration
[1:54:54] change has to come through a death.
[1:54:56] Hallelujah. So he crossed over. Remember
[1:54:59] before Moses Hallelujah. Before Joshua
[1:55:02] got the fullness of Moses ministry, he
[1:55:05] had to cross two. Amen.
[1:55:09] Hallelujah. So church, you can see the
[1:55:12] acceptance of moving forth with Elijah's
[1:55:14] ministry. Hallelujah.
[1:55:17] My brother takes a death.
[1:55:20] See, I don't know about you guys, but
[1:55:22] when I see God do something in in in the
[1:55:24] prophet's life, I believe I can do it,
[1:55:27] too.
[1:55:29] If I need it.
[1:55:34] If I need it. Amen.
[1:55:39] I believe if I need it, God can give me
[1:55:41] $100,000.
[1:55:43] [Music]
[1:55:48] See, I didn't put that out there now.
[1:55:50] Hallelujah. I believe God can do it.
[1:55:54] [Applause]
[1:55:56] But look, church, he says, he says, he
[1:55:59] cross over. He said, "Hey, tell me what
[1:56:02] you want." Uhhuh. See, we're not just
[1:56:04] following the prophet to be following
[1:56:05] him. There's something I want.
[1:56:09] There's something I want. Hallelujah.
[1:56:12] Hallelujah. He said, "What do you want?"
[1:56:14] He said, "Hey, I want a double portion."
[1:56:17] [Applause]
[1:56:21] He He didn't even ask for the mantle.
[1:56:25] People want Brother Brandham's hat. They
[1:56:28] want the buck be. They want a bullet.
[1:56:32] Elisha didn't even ask for the mantle.
[1:56:35] He said, "I want a double portion of thy
[1:56:38] spirit."
[1:56:40] He said, "I want that spirit that's on
[1:56:42] you. I want the spirit. A hat ain't
[1:56:45] going to do me no good. A Eagle's B
[1:56:47] ain't going to do me no good. A trip to
[1:56:49] Jeffersonville ain't going to do me no
[1:56:51] good. Going to the grave ain't going to
[1:56:53] do me no good.
[1:56:55] [Applause]
[1:56:58] I want that spirit. I want that life.
[1:57:03] Yes sir. That demons are subject to sir.
[1:57:07] Yes sir.
[1:57:09] Yes sir. Brother Bernard will cast out
[1:57:11] demons. They come in the room and wake
[1:57:13] him up. He say that oh that's just you.
[1:57:15] And he turn back over and go to sleep.
[1:57:18] [Applause]
[1:57:21] Glory. Glory. Glory. Glory. Demons would
[1:57:23] call him out before he even say we know
[1:57:27] who thou art.
[1:57:30] [Music]
[1:57:31] Who else did they do that to? Jesus.
[1:57:37] Not just Jesus, Paul.
[1:57:40] The bride of Christ.
[1:57:44] See, they loop the spirit that was in
[1:57:48] Paul with the same spirit of Jesus.
[1:57:52] What should be happening to us?
[1:57:55] [Applause]
[1:57:56] Prophecy will find you, but you need to
[1:57:59] be the manifestation of the prophecy.
[1:58:03] Listen, Elisha says, everybody, all
[1:58:07] right, I'm about to close. Elijah says,
[1:58:09] "Hey, if you see me when I'm gone,
[1:58:11] that's what he said."
[1:58:13] That's the key. Uhhuh. When I'm gone,
[1:58:16] let the flesh go.
[1:58:18] That's it. That's right. That's it. Let
[1:58:20] the flesh go.
[1:58:22] He said, "If you see me when I'm gone,
[1:58:24] you have what you ask for." That's
[1:58:25] right. He said first, he said, "You ask
[1:58:27] a hard thing."
[1:58:29] He said, "You ask a hard thing, but if
[1:58:32] you see me when I'm gone, you have what
[1:58:33] you ask for." So, he stayed close to
[1:58:35] that word. He stayed close to that
[1:58:37] prophet. Don't let people pull you away
[1:58:39] from this message. Talking about I don't
[1:58:42] see it in the Bible. You better ask God
[1:58:44] for understanding.
[1:58:47] This message is in your Bible.
[1:58:51] [Applause]
[1:58:57] Like you try to tell women about wearing
[1:58:59] pants.
[1:59:05] Still got a little bit of pants suits in
[1:59:07] here.
[1:59:12] They said, "Well, where well the Bible
[1:59:13] the Bible don't say pants.
[1:59:16] It say garments pertaining to a man."
[1:59:19] When was the last time you seen your
[1:59:20] husband in a dress?
[1:59:24] Those not his garments.
[1:59:27] His garments are pants. Slacks.
[1:59:31] Hallelujah. See, don't get caught up in
[1:59:33] all this foolishness talking about I
[1:59:34] don't see it in the Bible. That's the
[1:59:36] devil talking to you.
[1:59:40] He said if you see me when I'm gone. He
[1:59:42] stayed close. He stayed so close to what
[1:59:45] the prophet was doing that fire had to
[1:59:48] separate them. That's right.
[1:59:52] Fire came and separated them.
[1:59:53] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And the chariots
[1:59:57] gathered him up and took him up.
[1:59:59] Hallelujah. He threw the mantle back.
[2:00:01] Hallelujah. What was the mantle? The
[2:00:04] mantle was the anointing of Christ.
[2:00:07] Amen. Cuz that's what he asked for a
[2:00:08] double portion. Hallelujah. But he
[2:00:11] grabbed the mantel, put it on, then he
[2:00:13] went and walked back to the same waters,
[2:00:16] took it off,
[2:00:19] and all he could do was operate in what
[2:00:21] he saw.
[2:00:24] He operated in what he believed. All we
[2:00:27] could do is operate in what we read.
[2:00:31] Hallelujah. He took the mantle off. He
[2:00:32] said, "Where be the God of Elijah smoke
[2:00:36] the waters and the waters move.
[2:00:39] [Applause]
[2:00:42] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:00:48] This message will work the exact same
[2:00:50] way.
[2:00:53] I know of a sister whose husband had uh
[2:00:57] epileptic fits
[2:01:00] and a and and a pastor that was
[2:01:02] preaching for them. She came in the
[2:01:04] prayer line and she told the story but
[2:01:06] said my husband he just get all messed
[2:01:08] up and all you know when he had them
[2:01:09] fits. You know what he did?
[2:01:12] He said there was a woman just like you
[2:01:15] brother Brandham talked about. He said
[2:01:17] what I want you to do is take his shirt
[2:01:19] off and go burn it.
[2:01:22] She didn't have a fireplace but she took
[2:01:24] it and burned it. And that was the last
[2:01:26] time he had her feet again.
[2:01:33] This message is true.
[2:01:38] Come musicians, I'm closing.
[2:01:43] This Bible is true.
[2:01:46] The word of God still works.
[2:01:50] Prophecy will find you. You will fulfill
[2:01:53] the good. Or you will fulfill the bad.
[2:01:57] It's up to you to decide. Cuz remember,
[2:02:01] there had to be somebody to betray
[2:02:03] Jesus.
[2:02:06] Judas fulfilled his part of prophecy.
[2:02:09] That's exactly right.
[2:02:11] That's exactly right. That's where you
[2:02:13] don't want to be. But you're fulfilling
[2:02:15] the bad.
[2:02:17] We want to take this word and walk in
[2:02:19] it. The reason why people are having
[2:02:22] problems with the message is because
[2:02:24] they're trying to make it too much
[2:02:26] flesh.
[2:02:29] Amen. We walk in the spirit as he's in
[2:02:31] the spirit. The Bible says if that
[2:02:34] spirit that raised him up from the dead
[2:02:37] Yes, sir. dwells in you, it'll quicken
[2:02:39] your mortal body.
[2:02:42] The spirit,
[2:02:44] that's what it's about. Hallelujah.
[2:02:47] This message deals with the spirit, man.
[2:02:50] Hallelujah. Yes. This message came to
[2:02:52] show us that Genesis 1:26 and Genesis
[2:02:56] 2:7 were two different things that took
[2:02:57] place
[2:03:00] sir. Yes, sir. To the same person.
[2:03:07] Hallelujah.
[2:03:08] One was for the spirit of man and one
[2:03:11] was for the flesh of man.
[2:03:14] Hallelujah. So church, we have to watch
[2:03:17] and be careful what we read. Hallelujah.
[2:03:20] and what we hear because prophecy will
[2:03:23] find you. That's right. Remember the
[2:03:25] Bible says when you reject truth, you
[2:03:27] become what? Reprobate.
[2:03:30] Giving yourself over to itch and ears.
[2:03:32] Yes sir. Yes sir. But never fully coming
[2:03:35] into the knowledge of the truth. Ever
[2:03:37] learning. Ever learning. Ever.
[2:03:42] You know, I've heard people say, "Man, I
[2:03:44] left a message and I've never been this
[2:03:47] free. Oh man, I'm just I'm just so free
[2:03:50] now. You know why they free? Cuz they
[2:03:53] don't have to be a hypocrite no more.
[2:03:57] That's why they free. That's it. They
[2:03:59] can go do all the filth they want to do.
[2:04:02] Hallelujah. That's why they free.
[2:04:06] It ain't the word that made them free.
[2:04:13] Oh my. I'm just experiencing new levels
[2:04:16] in God.
[2:04:21] Trust me, God ain't with you while you
[2:04:23] on the beach in a bikini.
[2:04:26] [Applause]
[2:04:32] He ain't getting no pleasure out of
[2:04:33] that.
[2:04:36] Young sisters, I tell you, if you you
[2:04:39] talking to a young man, he talking about
[2:04:40] send me some pictures.
[2:04:44] Come on, brother. Send me Send me some
[2:04:46] pictures. You really love me. Send me
[2:04:48] some pictures. Come on, brother. You
[2:04:51] know you you know we going we going to
[2:04:52] get married, but I need to I need to
[2:04:54] know what I'm working with.
[2:05:00] Send me some pictures if you love me.
[2:05:03] You know what you ought to do?
[2:05:14] And then text him and say, "Did you get
[2:05:16] it? Did you get who I am?" Yes, sir. Did
[2:05:19] you see me in there? Yes, sir.
[2:05:25] Did you see me in there? That's who I
[2:05:28] am. I'm the word for my day. I'm the
[2:05:31] manifestation of this hour. Hallelujah.
[2:05:35] I'm Christ revealed in the flesh.
[2:05:40] Let's pray.
[2:05:43] [Music]
[2:05:45] [Applause]
[2:05:46] [Music]

[2:07:06] talk about the message, and you not to

[2:07:11] pray Lord that the leading of the spirit
[2:07:13] will continue to guide us. Father, go
[2:07:15] with us, Lord, in this as we leave this

[2:07:20] for a a a greater yielding in our lives
[2:07:23] to the things of truth, Lord God, and a
[2:07:26] binding of things that are false, Lord,
[2:07:29] help us to be careful how we hear and
[2:07:31] what we read and what we see, Lord, that
[2:07:34] we will always look for the truth in
[2:07:36] everything that we do. Lord, bless you.
[2:07:39] Bless his church, Lord, and the pastor,
[2:07:40] his his wife, his children, Lord, his
[2:07:43] church family, and all those connected.
[2:07:46] In the wonderful name of Jesus Christ,
[2:07:47] we pray the church. Amen.

[2:07:57] so great
[2:08:01] so great.

[2:08:42] So great.
[2:08:44] There is no one else like you.
[2:08:50] There is no one else like you.
[2:08:58] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Let's give him a
[2:09:00] clap offering tonight.
[2:09:03] [Applause]
[2:09:04] [Music]
[2:09:05] Amen. Amen. What a message tonight.
[2:09:10] Amen. Prophecy will find you. Amen.
[2:09:15] During the last eight years, how many
[2:09:17] prophecies has been fulfilled concerning
[2:09:20] this message?
[2:09:23] Amen.
[2:09:24] It is telling you
[2:09:27] one of this day if you play in church,
[2:09:31] you will come here yourself.
[2:09:35] You will find a song leader. He's not
[2:09:37] here. You will call me, my phone will be
[2:09:40] ringing. I won't be here. Amen. Prophecy
[2:09:43] is going one after the other. Prophecy
[2:09:46] is finding Trump. It's finding Biden.
[2:09:50] It's finding the Pope. It's finding
[2:09:52] Camala. It's finding all these people.
[2:09:55] What do you think about your life? And
[2:09:58] if your life doesn't terry with the
[2:10:00] gospel and prophecy cannot still find
[2:10:02] you despite all the evidences that we
[2:10:06] still have, you still struggling with
[2:10:08] the world.
[2:10:13] Watch which side of the prophecy you are
[2:10:15] fulfilling
[2:10:16] because either you going to fulfill the
[2:10:18] good prophecy or you will fulfill the
[2:10:20] bad prophecy. But if you find yourself
[2:10:23] fulfilling what is bad, you need to run
[2:10:25] quickly back to the altar and make sure
[2:10:27] your life is center. Church time are
[2:10:31] very bad. Things that are happening all
[2:10:34] around us are very bad. They say we're
[2:10:37] going to make America great. It's not
[2:10:39] working. It is going all down and things
[2:10:42] are getting into a mess and it's all
[2:10:45] mess around. I don't know what type of
[2:10:47] world do you want to live again here.
[2:10:50] But as for me and my house,
[2:10:53] we will serve the Lord. Amen. And
[2:10:56] because we going through this last push
[2:10:58] of the brother, we have to tighten very
[2:11:01] hard to the word.
[2:11:04] Because at this point, I can't play
[2:11:05] because we are in the last ride.
[2:11:08] Amen. We are no more back there. We are
[2:11:11] very at the end. So this is the last
[2:11:13] time we need to use the last energy. So
[2:11:16] I have zero tolerance.
[2:11:18] I was talking I mean I was talking to a
[2:11:21] pastor tonight. I mean uh who day I
[2:11:24] spoke to him I say I have zero tolerance
[2:11:28] with the word of God. Either we are here
[2:11:30] for the message of the hour or we not
[2:11:33] here for the message of the hour because
[2:11:35] when I see prophecy it should scare you.
[2:11:38] It should bring you to look at who where
[2:11:41] where am I at? Okay. The pope now is
[2:11:43] revealed. The whole world knows about
[2:11:45] the pope. Okay. If you put a picture of
[2:11:48] the pope, you ask a message believer,
[2:11:49] they will tell you this is the pope from
[2:11:51] America. They know. If we put your
[2:11:53] picture, what do you tell people about?
[2:11:56] If we put your posting, what does people
[2:11:58] look about your posting? Or they still
[2:12:00] see worthiness? They still see
[2:12:03] craziness. Or can they look at you and
[2:12:05] they say, "This look like a god." I know
[2:12:09] this is hard, but I'm going to say it.
[2:12:11] when they look at the fourth man in the
[2:12:13] fire.
[2:12:15] Nebuchadnezzar,
[2:12:17] he didn't have a previous picture of God
[2:12:21] because if I have a picture of brother
[2:12:23] Khala, the day I will see him, I will
[2:12:25] say this is brother Khala because I have
[2:12:28] a previous picture. That was the first
[2:12:30] time hidden seen God. But when they see
[2:12:34] God, they recognize that that man look
[2:12:36] like a son of God. Can they look at you
[2:12:40] and see and say this is a man of God.
[2:12:43] This is a different person right here.
[2:12:45] The purpose is already been known. But
[2:12:47] can they reveal? What can you reveal to
[2:12:50] the world? Amen. When you taking your
[2:12:53] picture, you posting it. What does
[2:12:54] people see? A son of God or somebody
[2:12:57] who's self-promoting himself or somebody
[2:13:00] who want to show up something or are
[2:13:02] they looking at the son of God? They say
[2:13:04] there is something godly about this
[2:13:06] person. When you look at this picture,
[2:13:07] what do you see?
[2:13:10] What do you see in this picture? Do you
[2:13:11] see foolish nation?
[2:13:16] Prophecy will find you. Check your life.
[2:13:19] Examine your life. We're not going to
[2:13:21] temper with the word. We are staying
[2:13:23] right straight because I'm going to the
[2:13:25] It's like I'm trying to land the
[2:13:27] airplane. I can't play no game because
[2:13:29] game I'm going to kill people. I don't I
[2:13:32] will I was not prepared to kill people.
[2:13:34] I was prepared to pre to to to to get
[2:13:37] you all the way to the rapture. So there
[2:13:39] is no game at this point.
[2:13:42] Are we together? Are we together? Let's
[2:13:45] pray. Heavenly Father, Lord, we are
[2:13:48] approaching you humbly tonight, Lord.
[2:13:50] Father, thanking you for your grace, for
[2:13:53] your love and your mercy, and for
[2:13:54] everything you have been doing for us.
[2:13:57] Lord, it becames like a trend in the
[2:13:59] message. When a prophecy happen, people
[2:14:02] get all excited. Everybody want to post
[2:14:05] it on the social media to make sure they
[2:14:09] also are part of those that are posting
[2:14:12] and all it takes is few weeks and all
[2:14:15] the the excitement about the prophecy
[2:14:19] will be gone and then we are going back
[2:14:21] again acting foolishly and going back to
[2:14:24] everything that we were doing. And
[2:14:26] father, another prophecy will come as a
[2:14:28] wakeup call. And we do the same thing
[2:14:31] until it goes over and over. And we got
[2:14:34] used to the fulfillment of prophecy
[2:14:37] until it's not even shaking us a bit.
[2:14:40] Father, may you be merciful to your
[2:14:42] bride. May you be merciful to your
[2:14:44] children. May this sermon preached
[2:14:46] tonight be a wakeup call that we will
[2:14:49] look no more at the pope. No more
[2:14:51] following what the pope is doing,
[2:14:54] whatever he's going, where he's going.
[2:14:55] We already know that's the pope. We
[2:14:58] already know the pope is manifested. We
[2:15:00] don't have to go through the detail of
[2:15:02] the pope. Now, let's look at the detail
[2:15:04] of what the bride is supposed to
[2:15:06] fulfill. What am I supposed to do in
[2:15:08] this time? Let's focus on that one,
[2:15:11] Lord. Father, let's make sure everything
[2:15:13] is reflecting you so that we can be a
[2:15:16] living Bible that people can read and
[2:15:19] see and say, "Truly, this man was a son
[2:15:22] of God. Truly this woman was a daughter
[2:15:25] of God. Father I pray in the name of
[2:15:27] Jesus Christ that you come and help your
[2:15:30] children. Remove everyone Lord Father
[2:15:33] from everyone. Every demonic spirit of

[2:15:50] us travel mercy and consecrate us if you
[2:15:52] tell it to come. So that when we meet
[2:15:55] again, Lord, Father, we be fresh under
[2:15:57] the inspiration of the Holy Spirit to
[2:15:59] gather again about the things of the
[2:16:01] kingdom. Lord, I pray, Lord, Father,
[2:16:03] that you touch Brother Digs. Lord,
[2:16:05] strengthen him, Lord Father. Give him
[2:16:08] travel mercy, Lord Father, and look at
[2:16:09] all the sacrifices he's doing for the
[2:16:12] kingdom of God. May you reward him and
[2:16:14] his family. We thank you and commit
[2:16:16] everything unto thy hand in the name of
[2:16:19] Jesus Christ. Amen. Go ahead.
