[42:35] spirit is that right
[42:37] huh we are supposed to be the most
[42:39] happiest people
[42:40] in the world in the land we cannot lose
[42:44] is that right
[42:45] we're just waiting to go home is that
[42:47] right
[42:52] let's look at this preserve first
[42:56] look at the greek definition of the
[42:59] preserved
[43:01] we want to look at this so we can lay
[43:03] you there a foundation
[43:06] it says is to keep in cause
[43:09] one preserve or to stand firmly on a
[43:12] thing
[43:16] it says it's it's we have
[43:20] let me read it to keep safe from injury
[43:23] harm destruction that's why the holy
[43:26] ghost was saying there
[43:27] about sunday morning it's time to come
[43:30] on up here
[43:31] is that right it's time to come on up
[43:33] hear them we're going to speak this word
[43:35] and you're going to see it if it's mixed
[43:37] with faith and love
[43:38] because this is a faith that's working
[43:40] by love is that right
[43:41] this is the hour here now is that right
[43:44] so we're moving forward
[43:45] when love is projected sovereign grace
[43:48] came in
[43:48] is that right that's why we got a
[43:50] testimony with brother maurice
[43:52] of mother why because he kept the faith
[43:56] he was obligated he kept god's
[43:58] commandments
[43:59] now he had money in the what in the
[44:02] heavenly bank is that right
[44:03] he had blessings in the heavenly bank is
[44:05] that right he said prove me
[44:08] ain't that what he said bring your tithe
[44:10] and office and prove me
[44:11] and she wrote blessing i have a blessing
[44:13] for you to wear in there we're at in a
[44:15] storehouse is that right
[44:17] where in the storehouse that's where
[44:19] your artillery is
[44:20] is that right huh i don't want to get
[44:22] ahead of myself
[44:24] hallelujah he said now look
[44:29] he says to keep alive intact or free
[44:32] from decay
[44:33] we're still talking about the greek
[44:34] definition of preserved
[44:37] it says something regarded as reserved
[44:39] for a certain person
[44:40] is that right only his bride is that
[44:45] right
[44:46] huh this is bride food right now look
[44:49] what he says
[44:50] he says to keep what you save from
[44:52] breaking down
[44:53] it says now it says to keep for special
[44:56] use
[44:59] he's kept us from is that right he's
[45:02] kept the foot
[45:03] special used he said but now here's
[45:05] where the little point i want to look at
[45:06] here and go into an
[45:08] area he says we have been called
[45:12] to serve legal rights
[45:15] on the devil and his kingdom
[45:19] and to take back what's ours
[45:24] we do not have to live below our
[45:26] standards god
[45:28] said no diseases or no sicknesses would
[45:31] come upon his children
[45:32] he said i will show that you are a
[45:35] special class of people
[45:37] you are different
[45:42] look what he says judy comes here
[45:46] to talk these things earnestly
[45:48] contending for the faith
[45:51] let's look at our first example with
[45:53] jesus continuing for the faith
[45:56] when jesus came contending for the faith
[45:59] he was prophesied over in isaac isaiah 9
[46:02] 6 a child shall be born a son shall be
[46:04] given
[46:04] he shall be called counselor the prince
[46:06] of peace the mighty god
[46:07] he shall have the government upon his
[46:09] shoulder that's why i said the last time
[46:11] when i was here with the government
[46:13] ah is that right
[46:16] and we've got the who the god watching
[46:18] over us the almighty god
[46:21] that have sent us here on a mission to
[46:23] earnestly contend forth his faith
[46:26] when jesus had came when jesus came here
[46:29] on the earth
[46:30] jesus came knowing that now he had to
[46:32] come what
[46:33] let's preach the gospel jesus said the
[46:35] spirit
[46:36] of the lord is upon me he had
[46:39] he has a near anointed me to preach the
[46:43] gospel
[46:44] and he will say i'll tell you what let's
[46:46] turn to luke 4 18.
[46:48] let's look at these scriptures then i
[46:50] i'm going to read to some of some of the
[46:52] quotes and things but let's get these
[46:53] scriptures
[46:54] laid out hallelujah
[46:57] luke chapter four when jesus came
[47:01] on this earth he was on he knew
[47:04] he was on a mission and god anointed
[47:07] jesus
[47:09] at 4 18. they have it say amen
[47:12] he said the spirit of the lord is upon
[47:14] me because he has anointed me to preach
[47:16] the gospel to who
[47:18] to the poor he had sent me he had did
[47:21] what
[47:22] said sent i mean he has
[47:26] ordered me he has ordered you
[47:30] to earnestly contend to the faith that's
[47:33] why you go over
[47:34] to job last time we just hit job
[47:37] 42-5 in that scripture there when he
[47:41] said that
[47:41] job heard him he said faith come by what
[47:44] hearing hearing the word of god he
[47:47] didn't have an
[47:48] ear he that had the faith let him hear
[47:51] what the spirit is saying
[47:52] unto the church so he's now and he's
[47:55] coming in
[47:55] that means you do not wait someone
[47:59] that hears the word of god and notice a
[48:03] commandment from god
[48:04] they do not wait to move into it they
[48:07] move into it
[48:08] is that right
[48:12] you've been sent by god
[48:15] he said man look he said he said
[48:18] to heal the brokenhearted see to preach
[48:21] deliverance to the captives
[48:23] and the recovering the sight of the
[48:25] blind to set at
[48:26] liberty them that are what bruised
[48:30] now he coming in when jesus came he not
[48:33] only spoke
[48:34] these things jesus came and performed
[48:36] them god performed them
[48:38] it wasn't christ it was god is that
[48:40] right jesus said i did nothing unless
[48:42] the father
[48:43] showed me is that right now each and
[48:46] every one of you
[48:47] the lord have showed us sunday morning
[48:49] that word the two speakers what a pencil
[48:52] is that right he told us is that right
[48:55] we do not
[48:56] have to bow down to anything of satan
[48:59] because we have been taught that the
[49:01] word of god
[49:02] mixed with love and faith can defeat the
[49:05] devil
[49:05] anywhere anytime on any ground
[49:09] no demon forces can stand before it is
[49:12] that right
[49:13] where are you coming in where have you
[49:15] seen someone last time
[49:17] coming to worship service they get slain
[49:20] in the worship service
[49:21] and you hear those demons crying out of
[49:23] the presence of the lord is that right
[49:26] they came in and you used to remember
[49:28] when that devil
[49:29] that was in that land he was trained up
[49:31] and trying to lunatic demon
[49:33] he was trying to take him out of his
[49:35] mind he was trying to destroy him
[49:37] but when jesus came on the scene he'd
[49:39] come to the devil
[49:40] a dog he's got understanding of the word
[49:43] he always wanted mercy
[49:45] he always wanted grace would you come
[49:48] and destroy us before our time
[49:51] that were you destroyed before our time
[49:55] he said he said let us go jesus said
[49:58] go is that right because those demons
[50:01] did what
[50:04] they recognized the presence of the lord
[50:12] when praises go up blessings come now
[50:15] at your lowest time if you want to shake
[50:18] the foundation
[50:20] when paul and then was in jail innocent
[50:23] at the lowest point and they threw him
[50:26] in jail
[50:27] for the name of jesus christ and that
[50:29] worked them on mercifully
[50:31] empowering them start singing praises to
[50:34] god
[50:34] start worshiping the god the foundation
[50:37] of the jail
[50:38] joke
[50:42] this is our hour the joy
[50:46] of the lord is our strength
[50:48] [Applause]
[50:48] [Music]
[50:51] when they came in they shook the jail
[50:54] [Music]
[50:55] we're talking about earnestly contending
[50:58] for the faith and when they laid there
[51:02] and the duke and the jail shook and when
[51:04] the jail
[51:05] or the foundation of the jail shook the
[51:08] jail
[51:09] shook open why was paul going in that
[51:11] jail
[51:12] they thought paul was sent in that jail
[51:14] because of what he did
[51:15] is that right no no no no no no god had
[51:19] a soul in that jail
[51:21] ah god had to get someone in there
[51:25] so when he went in there paul and him
[51:27] knew start singing praises
[51:29] when people see you being done wrong in
[51:32] the world
[51:33] when people seeing you being stepped on
[51:36] when you're seeing he's still being
[51:37] talked about
[51:38] and all they see you going about it
[51:40] saying he never failed me yet
[51:43] he never failed me yet jesus christ
[51:47] never failed me yet
[51:51] and everywhere i go i want the world to
[51:55] know see he coming in why
[51:59] because god had called us see a house of
[52:02] praise
[52:04] is that right we lifted him up we wasn't
[52:07] nothing we could be afraid of the
[52:09] adversary
[52:10] nothing we could be shaking up the
[52:12] adversary why
[52:14] because our savior who was delivering he
[52:16] loved me died and he saved me
[52:19] buried he carried my sins far away
[52:22] rising he
[52:23] justified freely forever see god has
[52:26] given us what
[52:27] justification sanctification your
[52:30] visitors that's out there
[52:32] you know we got justification
[52:35] sanctification and the baptism of the
[52:37] holy ghost
[52:38] you too a believer a true believer
[52:41] justification means
[52:42] we never done it is that right we've
[52:46] never
[52:46] done it what can wash away my sins
[52:50] nothing but the blood of jesus what can
[52:53] make me whole again nothing but the
[52:56] blood
[52:57] of jesus people are feeling
[53:00] the guilt people are feeling condemned
[53:04] why are you you're now in what christ
[53:07] jesus now we walk not after the flesh
[53:10] but after the spirit is that right we're
[53:13] talking about first
[53:14] jesus christ came doing nothing but good
[53:18] telling them about the good tidings is
[53:20] that right
[53:21] that's why they come over here god sent
[53:23] us to live what a
[53:24] respectable life and we got
[53:26] justification
[53:28] now when you're justified then you're
[53:30] what's sanctified
[53:31] right sanctified by the washing of the
[53:33] water of the word
[53:35] pray and read your bible we're talking
[53:37] about women's souls

[53:50] kingdom of god

[58:37] okay
[58:38] now look what we got praise the lord
[58:40] first time you're 16.
[58:44] see the holy spirit told us
[58:47] oh brusty that's beautiful too the three
[58:50] anointings the three crowning on david
[58:53] first he was there for saul then he was
[58:56] there for
[58:57] judah and then god would have known him
[58:59] for the whole israel
[59:00] is that right ah hallelujah
[59:04] let's look at david when david was here
[59:07] now for
[59:08] saul anointed what he was preserved for
[59:13] he represented
[59:16] and and the lord's said unto samuel
[59:20] he said how long without mourinho
[59:24] ah how long
[59:27] are you going to mourn for certain
[59:28] leaders how long are you going to keep
[59:30] doing it
[59:31] huh you don't have to worry about them
[59:34] with soul loss
[59:36] no
[59:39] press to the mark of the prize of the
[59:41] high calling
[59:42] everyone is not ordained for this
[59:44] rapture
[59:46] everyone is not
[59:50] is only the elected by predestination
[59:55] by for knowledge is that right
[1:00:00] look at david's position
[1:00:04] he says seeing i have rejected him from
[1:00:07] reigning over israel
[1:00:09] he says fill thy horn with oil and go
[1:00:11] and i will send thee
[1:00:12] to jesse the bethlehemite for i have
[1:00:15] provided me a king
[1:00:16] among among his sons
[1:00:20] he said now look at that for the sake of
[1:00:23] time
[1:00:23] drop down to verse six he says and it
[1:00:26] came to pass
[1:00:27] when when they had come that looked on
[1:00:30] elias
[1:00:30] and said surely the lord's anointing is
[1:00:33] before him
[1:00:34] he said but the lord said unto samuel
[1:00:36] look not on his what
[1:00:38] continents nor his height of his statue
[1:00:41] because i have refused him
[1:00:43] for the lord seeth not as man sees
[1:00:46] for man looketh on the what the outward
[1:00:49] appearance
[1:00:50] but the lord looketh on to the heart
[1:00:53] okay that's why the lord put up on that
[1:00:56] boy's sunday right
[1:00:57] so as a man thinkers as he thinketh in
[1:00:59] his what
[1:01:00] heart it was three ways that the man
[1:01:02] could speak right he speak from his
[1:01:04] mouth is that right
[1:01:05] but the abundance of it comes from is
[1:01:07] what comes from his heart is that right
[1:01:09] that's why he says malachi 4 came to
[1:01:12] turn the hearts of the fathers to the
[1:01:14] children
[1:01:14] the message came to change what our
[1:01:16] hearts and bring him back and make
[1:01:18] christ
[1:01:19] preeminence make christ the word make
[1:01:21] the word
[1:01:22] first in your life that's why he was
[1:01:24] telling them go up into jerusalem
[1:01:26] and wait until you're endured with what
[1:01:28] power up on high with that
[1:01:31] waiting until the what until the holy
[1:01:33] ghost come
[1:01:34] you cannot be a witness unto me until
[1:01:36] jerusalem until all samaria but the
[1:01:39] utmost part of the earth
[1:01:40] until the holy ghost comes is that right
[1:01:42] you can't walk right you can't talk
[1:01:44] right you can't pray right
[1:01:46] you can't love right you can't sing
[1:01:48] right until the
[1:01:49] holy ghost comes
[1:01:55] that's what he's bringing us into now
[1:01:56] but look what he told him to tarry
[1:01:58] oh look at the grace that's been
[1:02:00] extended to us
[1:02:01] to us gentile dogs it says over in acts
[1:02:05] as peter spake these words the holy
[1:02:08] ghost
[1:02:08] fell right on them glory be the god
[1:02:12] all you have to do is receive it and you
[1:02:14] believe it is that right
[1:02:18] when understanding comes confidence
[1:02:21] comes
[1:02:22] confidence comes faith comes faith is a
[1:02:24] revelation
[1:02:25] and only god can give you a revelation
[1:02:27] what god has given us here now
[1:02:29] is revel is fresh hidden in manner
[1:02:32] hidden in the scriptures do i understand
[1:02:35] all of it
[1:02:35] no but i believe it so when i go home i
[1:02:38] start digging too
[1:02:40] [Applause]
[1:02:46] he said look he says verse eight
[1:02:49] he said then jesse called abinada and
[1:02:52] made him
[1:02:52] pass before samuel and he said neither
[1:02:55] had the lord chosen this
[1:02:57] he said then jesse made shema to pass by
[1:03:00] and he said and he said neither had the
[1:03:03] lord chosen this
[1:03:05] he says again jesse married seven of his
[1:03:08] sons to pass before
[1:03:09] samuel and samuel said unto jesse the
[1:03:12] lord have not chosen thee and samuel
[1:03:14] said
[1:03:14] unto jesse are there all thy children
[1:03:17] and he said
[1:03:18] there remaineth yet who the youngest and
[1:03:21] behold the keepeth the sheep
[1:03:23] and samuel said unto jesse sin and fetch
[1:03:26] him
[1:03:27] for we will not sit down till he come
[1:03:30] hither
[1:03:31] that right he sent him and bought him
[1:03:33] and then now he was
[1:03:34] ready and with a beautiful countenance
[1:03:37] and goodly to look upon
[1:03:38] and and the lord said arise anoint him
[1:03:42] for this is he he said this samuel took
[1:03:45] the horn
[1:03:46] of the oil and anointed him in the midst
[1:03:48] of his brethren
[1:03:49] and the what the spirit of the law
[1:03:53] came upon david from that day forward
[1:03:56] so samuel rose up and went now
[1:04:00] verse 14 but the spirit of the lord
[1:04:03] departed from who saw and
[1:04:07] and an evil spirit from the lord
[1:04:10] troubled him and
[1:04:13] saul's servant said unto him behold now
[1:04:16] an evil spirit from god
[1:04:18] troubles thee let our lord now command
[1:04:21] thy servants with before thee
[1:04:22] to seek out a man who is a cunning
[1:04:25] player
[1:04:26] on an heart and it shall come to pass
[1:04:29] when the evil spirit from god is upon
[1:04:31] thee
[1:04:32] that he shall play with his hand and
[1:04:35] thou
[1:04:35] shall what be well now let's drop over
[1:04:38] to verse 20.

[1:04:43] and a bottle of wine and the kids sent
[1:04:46] them
[1:04:46] by david his son unto saul
[1:04:49] and david came to saul and stood before
[1:04:52] him and he loved him greatly and he
[1:04:54] became his
[1:04:55] his what he was his armor barrier
[1:05:01] god would use david as his
[1:05:04] as saul's on the barrier
[1:05:08] save it was at that time under that
[1:05:11] anointing
[1:05:12] god was using david to anoint him
[1:05:15] to be that armor barrier for his servant
[1:05:19] the anointed watch over the anointed
[1:05:21] touching out my anointing and doing my
[1:05:24] my service no harm is that what he told

[1:08:00] they ask him for trouble you got to
[1:08:02] understand
[1:08:04] when jesus came into the land this was
[1:08:06] not like moses
[1:08:10] when acan brought them babylonian
[1:08:13] garments
[1:08:14] into the camp and the movement of god
[1:08:17] was on
[1:08:18] is that right the bible said his heart
[1:08:21] wasn't changed yet
[1:08:23] he coveted those things and when it was
[1:08:26] time for joshua to come in here he sent
[1:08:28] the ministry at him he sent the spirit
[1:08:30] at him
[1:08:31] he said bring him before us and he asked
[1:08:33] him was these things done
[1:08:35] say yeah and joshua did what not only
[1:08:37] killed him he killed him and his whole
[1:08:39] family
[1:08:41] every demon force that's come up in here
[1:08:43] is going to be exposed
[1:08:45] every devil that come up in here if your
[1:08:48] motive and objective is not for the word
[1:08:50] to be manifested to
[1:08:52] glorify god and his people
[1:08:55] be careful
[1:09:00] they take some of the things that they
[1:09:02] take some of the things that happen
[1:09:04] lightly
[1:09:10] hallelujah he said look
[1:09:14] see we came here we know we recognize
[1:09:15] we're in the war
[1:09:17] see when i'm going those prisons was in
[1:09:19] those jails
[1:09:20] you're dealing with all kind of demon
[1:09:22] forces
[1:09:23] he said they get to see many that come
[1:09:25] in my name
[1:09:27] you got murderers you got drug dealers
[1:09:30] you got child molesters you got feeling
[1:09:32] flammers you got all these in there
[1:09:35] but you got to love them because one of
[1:09:38] those seeds are going to come
[1:09:40] one of those seeds may be hidden up in
[1:09:43] what that role
[1:09:44] that road that god allowed them to play
[1:09:47] that
[1:09:48] seed may be hit up in there so only
[1:09:51] god can desert so the only thing can go
[1:09:54] down
[1:09:55] into a broken heart a broken heart is a
[1:09:58] crushed heart
[1:09:59] i want nothing but the gospel the gospel
[1:10:03] the good news and let a person know that
[1:10:06] judy
[1:10:07] come to set the captive freight see when
[1:10:10] they come in when a man locked up in
[1:10:12] there
[1:10:13] to be convicted see convicted to an
[1:10:16] inmate is not a good word you see what
[1:10:19] i'm saying but if he can catch the
[1:10:21] revelation once he's
[1:10:22] born again or the ordering of the spirit
[1:10:25] being convicted to a believer is a good
[1:10:28] thing
[1:10:31] so you got people that's there that god
[1:10:34] is using why they're locked up
[1:10:37] that's why when my son when he wasn't
[1:10:39] hearing you know and understand why my
[1:10:41] heart believed
[1:10:42] and i believe it when god opened back up
[1:10:44] again open them up abundantly lord
[1:10:47] because we're at the end so those souls
[1:10:50] that they can get to hear this gospel
[1:10:52] so they can hear this message i mean i
[1:10:55] can bring the books and the tapes and
[1:10:57] things in it
[1:10:57] but when i write them i say you write
[1:11:00] the voice to the voice of god according
[1:11:02] post office box 950 jeffersonville
[1:11:06] indiana 47181 is that right
[1:11:10] and they can get i said now i want you
[1:11:11] to remember is that right
[1:11:14] we're not part of the fanaticism but the
[1:11:17] word is real
[1:11:18] we got scriptures back and that is this
[1:11:21] so you bring them you have them away
[1:11:23] where they can get it
[1:11:24] you know testimony you know
[1:11:26] jeffersonville they're pushing out the
[1:11:28] tablet
[1:11:29] they're pushing the tablet out there now
[1:11:31] the agape tablet i think it is
[1:11:34] so they don't have the books for anyone
[1:11:36] anyone can't get the books anymore
[1:11:38] so i called the brother up there in
[1:11:40] jeffersonville i said brother i heard
[1:11:42] that we can't

[1:11:55] public he said but we're only printing
[1:11:57] them in heaven
[1:11:58] for the inmates that are in prison
[1:12:04] and see what the lord has done he's
[1:12:06] going to get his word
[1:12:08] nothing can stop god's word from getting
[1:12:10] out there
[1:12:11] so we was there you know the last time

[1:12:15] preached
[1:12:16] you take a lot of fiery darts for this
[1:12:19] gospel oh i've been put out a few times

[1:12:25] put out of a prison
[1:12:26] but let me tell you something but you
[1:12:28] have to understand is these religious
[1:12:30] demons that you're fighting up against
[1:12:32] has come to set them free so our last
[1:12:34] meeting we had
[1:12:35] 24 sold i'm not talking about decisions
[1:12:38] see when you're going in there they're
[1:12:40] getting decisions the nomination
[1:12:42] organizations are getting decisions
[1:12:44] nothing against the people
[1:12:46] the good people there but we're warned
[1:12:48] against the doctrine
[1:12:50] because it binds them up so where they
[1:12:53] do they get decisions
[1:12:54] we don't get decisions we get
[1:12:57] confessions
[1:12:58] you know you get confessions and and
[1:13:00] that brings them in
[1:13:01] now he said we believe in our heart and
[1:13:03] confess with thy mouth that was jesus
[1:13:05] christ has come and died on the cross
[1:13:07] and took away your sin and rose on the
[1:13:09] third day is that right
[1:13:11] we're coming and now preaching his
[1:13:13] gospel to set the captive free
[1:13:16] so we're coming in not just just letter
[1:13:18] only but to come in power
[1:13:20] and then demonstration the last meeting
[1:13:23] that we had and we got over there
[1:13:25] we were there in alabama in a prison
[1:13:28] preaching this gospel
[1:13:29] this end time message why because they
[1:13:32] never
[1:13:32] heard these type of words being brought
[1:13:35] to them again
[1:13:36] letting a man know no justification
[1:13:39] is past lutheran all they know is luther
[1:13:42] justification
[1:13:43] smoking a pipe is that right and you
[1:13:46] could drink beer
[1:13:47] they stopped there because they believed
[1:13:49] that was all right
[1:13:50] then we turned around but sanctification
[1:13:53] is that right
[1:13:54] wesley came is that right you're
[1:13:56] watching by the water by the blood or
[1:13:57] the water of the world
[1:13:59] then we came with what the baptism of
[1:14:01] the holy ghost
[1:14:02] you had some bound up with pentecost
[1:14:05] believing
[1:14:06] that speaking in tongues was the
[1:14:08] evidence of the holy ghost
[1:14:10] but god had a hidden nugget is that
[1:14:12] right
[1:14:13] he's bringing the word to manuka for
[1:14:16] serving us is that right some got the
[1:14:19] holy ghost
[1:14:19] and speaking tones but that was not the
[1:14:22] evidence
[1:14:22] because they still walk around living
[1:14:25] like the devil
[1:14:26] is that right
[1:14:33] appreciate me somebody they call a
[1:14:36] murderer
[1:14:37] somebody they call a drug dealer
[1:14:40] somebody they call a child molester
[1:14:42] someone they call a b e or house
[1:14:45] invasion artist
[1:14:46] someone you looked upon crying out
[1:14:50] broken and contrite spirits crying out
[1:14:54] for the lord
[1:14:55] because they can discern that the love
[1:14:58] that you have for them
[1:15:00] or last minute before they shut down the
[1:15:02] prisons
[1:15:03] 24 souls came repented
[1:15:06] that one that signed up for baptism in
[1:15:09] the name of jesus christ
[1:15:15] you're talking about somebody that's
[1:15:16] bound up only offer them notes now let
[1:15:19] god have his way
[1:15:20] he's talking about being preserved he's
[1:15:22] preserving us by the preserver
[1:15:24] we are attack we are attacking satan's
[1:15:27] kingdom
[1:15:27] is that right he said we wrestle not
[1:15:30] against flesh and blood
[1:15:31] but against principalities and powers
[1:15:34] and wickedness
[1:15:35] and rulers in high places cast down
[1:15:38] every imagination
[1:15:39] that try to attack your mind is that
[1:15:41] right if it doesn't line up with the
[1:15:43] word of god
[1:15:44] cast it down he said about talking about
[1:15:47] what that is that
[1:15:48] virus what virus what virus you talking

[1:15:52] that devil god told me no diseases
[1:15:55] he told me greater is he that is in me
[1:15:59] than he that is in the world you have to
[1:16:01] speak it by faith
[1:16:02] and watch god honors it huh
[1:16:06] your child you have the authority
[1:16:09] to turn the bird if god this is an
[1:16:11] individual walk
[1:16:13] god want to do that you got people that
[1:16:15] bound up
[1:16:16] by by the true baptism the revelation of
[1:16:20] the baptism
[1:16:21] is that right matthew 28 18 they say
[1:16:24] go hear all the world preach the gospel
[1:16:26] baptizing them teaching
[1:16:28] all nations baptizing them in the name
[1:16:30] of the father

[1:17:13] nothing because you have been called

[1:17:18] about this gospel
[1:17:19] [Applause]
[1:17:27] the name father is not a name

[1:17:33] all were baptized
[1:17:34] in the name in the name
[1:17:38] of jesus christ in thy name
[1:17:41] they said cast out devils is that right
[1:17:45] that's the only name a unsaved gentile
[1:17:49] is gonna answer to
[1:17:56] we're talking about being preserved to
[1:17:59] fight this war
[1:18:00] we wrestle not against flesh and blood
[1:18:02] but against principalities and powers
[1:18:04] and wickedness and rulers in high places
[1:18:06] that's what the pastor verse steve was
[1:18:08] talking about when you get in that
[1:18:10] prayer closet

[1:18:12] thanking him maybe you have a hard time
[1:18:14] breaking through

[1:18:19] even brother branham said he had a time
[1:18:21] sometime he said but i what i pray the
[1:18:23] prayer of faith
[1:18:24] because the prayer of faith is the word
[1:18:28] of god

[1:19:06] the preserver
[1:19:08] god has chosen you and called you
[1:19:11] and anointed you look at david
[1:19:15] look what he says he says hallelujah
[1:19:21] i'm still at acts chapter five
[1:19:25] that's why i said you you need to be
[1:19:26] careful and those that are viewing it
[1:19:29] you need to be careful if you're kind of
[1:19:32] fussed and trying to fix a scheme
[1:19:36] and trying to deform god's word we get
[1:19:39] in another lesson next time in chapter
[1:19:41] 17
[1:19:42] and show you why god sent this ministry

[1:20:38] when they heard that they cut was cut to
[1:20:40] their heart and took counsel to slay him
[1:20:42] then stood there up one in the council a
[1:20:45] pharisee's name gamilion
[1:20:47] a doctor of the law and a reputation
[1:20:50] among all the people
[1:20:52] chameleon was there we don't see him but
[1:20:54] i think simeon was his daddy
[1:20:56] simeon had him up in his buddhism is
[1:20:58] that right ah
[1:21:00] simeon was after a little more let us

[1:21:07] go in there when you go inside of there
[1:21:08] you fighting these demons of religion
[1:21:11] religion and salvation is two different
[1:21:13] things
[1:21:14] salvation only comes by jesus christ his
[1:21:18] blood that he shed for you and i
[1:21:20] on coward and in there
[1:21:24] taking our sins away telling them about
[1:21:27] the goodness of the lord
[1:21:28] get them in tell them about brother
[1:21:30] maurice's yeah you're going to hear
[1:21:32] somebody

[1:21:35] who god is going to save his soul in him
[1:21:38] tell him
[1:21:39] tell them about the testimonies that
[1:21:41] come from out here
[1:21:42] tell them about the testimonies
[1:21:46] hallelujah
[1:21:50] they said now look he says in verse 35
[1:21:54] and said unto them ye men of israel here
[1:21:57] you come are
[1:21:58] well reputed my reputation has a good
[1:22:01] reputation among
[1:22:03] those jews those pharisees he said then
[1:22:06] he said them
[1:22:07] ye men of israel take heed to yourselves
[1:22:10] what do you intend to do as touching
[1:22:12] these men
[1:22:14] for before these days rose up the
[1:22:17] theaters
[1:22:18] men boasting himself to be somebody
[1:22:21] to whom a number of men about 400 joined
[1:22:24] themselves
[1:22:25] who were slain and all as many obeyed
[1:22:28] him were what
[1:22:29] scattered and brought to naught
[1:22:33] as as this man rose up judas of galilee
[1:22:36] in the days of the taxing and drew away
[1:22:39] much people
[1:22:40] after him he also perished and all even
[1:22:42] as many
[1:22:43] as what obeyed him were dispersed
[1:22:46] don't take some of these things that's
[1:22:48] happened lightly
[1:22:51] god is in control
[1:22:55] he's a god he's a god of love he's a god
[1:22:57] of peace but he's also a god of war
[1:23:03] he said he said and now i say unto you
[1:23:05] refrain from these men and let them
[1:23:07] alone
[1:23:08] for if these counsel or this work be of
[1:23:10] men it will come to what no
[1:23:13] but if it be of god ye cannot overthrow
[1:23:16] it lest happily ye be found even to
[1:23:19] fight against who
[1:23:21] god hallelujah
[1:23:25] look at this time oh my my my come on up
[1:23:27] man come on up musicians
[1:23:29] let's see what's up lord god we're
[1:23:31] talking about
[1:23:32] earnestly contending for this faith
[1:23:36] we're talking about you being preserved
[1:23:38] by the preserver
[1:23:39] and david was hidden away and is being
[1:23:41] preserved for that
[1:23:43] for his time and now we are being hit
[1:23:46] he said i would have a a church without
[1:23:49] a spot or a blemish without such
[1:23:51] that's why you keep it here when the
[1:23:53] pastor said i'm not he's not having
[1:23:55] nothing coming in here mixing with what
[1:23:57] the wheat bread is that right
[1:24:00] because god has restored he promised in
[1:24:03] his word to restore
[1:24:05] and now he's preserving you and i and it
[1:24:08] was preserving you and i
[1:24:09] to stand on this precious gospel and
[1:24:12] this gospel
[1:24:12] you go in there you can go go back and
[1:24:14] read i'll tell you what let me
[1:24:16] look at this one point i said i want to
[1:24:19] keep my word let me read the truth
[1:24:21] this quote here so as you can see he
[1:24:24] said now look
[1:24:26] i got this from earnestly contending
[1:24:28] from the faith
[1:24:31] he said because that he eloquent men
[1:24:35] are great speakers no
[1:24:37] [Music]
[1:24:38] how do you know them we know that thou
[1:24:41] art a teacher that comes from god for no
[1:24:43] man can do these things that you do the
[1:24:45] miracles that you do except god be with
[1:24:47] you
[1:24:48] they knew that that was they knew that
[1:24:51] that was
[1:24:52] him but for their prejudice
[1:24:56] selfishness not ready to
[1:24:59] have self-denial to renounce your own
[1:25:02] surrounding
[1:25:03] and accept him you see what he was
[1:25:05] saying now
[1:25:07] when you come up under a ministry i'm
[1:25:08] not lifting up a man i'm talking about
[1:25:10] the man jesus christ
[1:25:12] i'm talking about what god is doing now
[1:25:16] some things that you maybe possibly saw
[1:25:18] or thought
[1:25:19] see he says what a godly sorrow bring a
[1:25:22] godly repentance
[1:25:24] that you don't have to repent of any
[1:25:25] longer why
[1:25:27] because you don't have to repent of it
[1:25:29] any longer because now you got the
[1:25:30] revelation the truth
[1:25:32] of the word and that light you're
[1:25:35] walking into it
[1:25:37] you no longer have to repent from it any
[1:25:39] longer
[1:25:40] so now you can say hallelujah
[1:25:45] now god has preserved this word to keep
[1:25:48] us
[1:25:49] god preserved joseph so that many souls
[1:25:53] can be saved is that right
[1:25:55] god has preserved us so many souls
[1:25:58] can be saved in this end time hallelujah

[1:32:12] speak
[1:32:13] just to follow the same channel as my
[1:32:15] brother but there's something about us
[1:32:17] that we
[1:32:18] it's not a prison that we're miserable
[1:32:20] and it's not a prison that we don't want
[1:32:21] to be in
[1:32:22] but based off of predestination we're
[1:32:25] content we're happy we know there's
[1:32:26] nothing else out there for us
[1:32:28] you know the world's in ruins and we
[1:32:31] know that the only thing we have to hold
[1:32:32] to is the word even the word itself said
[1:32:34] heaven and earth
[1:32:35] pass away but his word never passed away
[1:32:39] so as we see his word continue to unfold
[1:32:41] and unfold we just want to
[1:32:42] place our stand on the word knowing that
[1:32:45] it will never pass away
[1:32:46] so we just thank the lord every sunday
[1:32:49] and wednesday coming
[1:32:50] here in this building and just speaking
[1:32:52] to us i'm thankful
[1:32:53] and i want to place my faith and trust
[1:32:56] in the word not in a man
[1:32:57] but in a word because we know the word
[1:33:00] will never fail
[1:33:01] so i'm happy to be a comic this evening
[1:33:03] i'm happy to be a convict of this
