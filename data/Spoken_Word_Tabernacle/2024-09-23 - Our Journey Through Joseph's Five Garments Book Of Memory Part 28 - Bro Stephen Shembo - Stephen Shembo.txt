have a wonderful young Sisters Meeting so somebody's happy we talked on courtship so everybody should be now up to date with courtship and know what to do and what not to do and we gave the difference between dating and courting very important watch out so confused in the message we don't know whether we dating or recording watch out watch so they all here they know exactly what it is their blood is no longer in my hand sir so parents stick with the word amen because we gave them the word the Bible and the message of the hour I went in so much detail left and right we had even an invisible audience yesterday break it from Florida the part of your church that's right amen don't worry I won't say anything from there amen we got an invisible audience and everything went well by the grace of God and I even demonstrated to them how you can have what you want through your husband without dominating him that's right I let that so in amen amen you can have everything you want if your husband want he can Without You dominating him without you taking control of the wedding you don't have to take control of the wedding you don't have to manipulate anything in the wedding there is things that you do and as you do your husband take over if you need those uh tips see the young sisters they will tell you what to do amen amen amen so when the young man is coming you know what to do don't poke any man they already understood that one it's the man cing the lady not the lady cing the man are we clear parent it is the man cing the lady not the lady cording the young man amen I gave them quot of brother brandham so please let's stay with the message and make my life easier I gave a quote that there is no courtship with somebody who doesn't believe the message so if somebody's not a brother parent help me cut him off so don't let him pass your border all the way to me you're making my job double because when he come to me I use a bazooka so before we get there cut him off far away cut him off even an unbeliever in the message you didn't get me well among the message churches we got unbelievers if he's an unbeliever parent cut him off amen so don't give me a lot of headache I taught them how to know the man of your life and I gave the quote of brother Bram how you can talk to a man and know that this is my husband they know it already so everything is clear welcome to the courtship and just get prepared you don't know who's starting first amen you already heard sister jush is getting married everybody heard about it right so if you waiting for an invitation the whole church is invited so just make sure you be there and support one another amen try to be there to support one another are we together yeah if you need uh if you still sad I have another good news sister Destiny is expecting a [Applause] boy I have seen the best gender reveal that I ever seen you have no clue what I seen so it was a cake and Ariana was eating the cake and until she got to the bottom and it turned blue and that's how we knew that he was a boy so that's the best one ever so if you give me headache I will just open that video and enjoy myself and just laugh and make sure I can relax amen so we praise God for everything that he's doing amen amen glory to God Lord's willing sister uh Divine you work with me for the next uh young sister's meeting so I can seal courtship and we get into engagement and then the married one you're going to get it later and the young man Lord's willing it's October the 12th we will finish your finance and once we finish it we go back to courtship Lord's willing this coming Saturday September the 28 28 is our question and answer and also on October the 12th which is the young men meeting it's going to be the wedding shower of sister

we will get the confirmation this week but we're shooting for October the 19th for the C Mary couple part two so it's not depending on us we will try if the 19s work we confirm it so please give me a thumbs up quickly so we have a head count and we move on Amen I believe I got everything clear brother Robert if I forgot something you let me know but I believe all is well by God's grace so let's stand to the reading of the scripture amen I will really warn you to really stay up today because we're getting into some deep stuff okay I don't want you to get lost so stay up if you begin to feel like that some your sleepy or something stand on the back because if not you will lose it and I don't want you to lose it because this is part of your deliverance you shall know the truth and the truth will set you free we clear so give me my time and let me dig into this I already warn you stay up my subject this morning is our journey our life journey through Joseph's five garment part 28 as a theme we will talk about the book of memory amen or the book of remembrance this is something deep so stay up we clear okay flight attendant prepare for take off let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we are approaching you humbly this morning Father we thank you for your grace for your love and your mercy and for everything you have been doing for us Lord father just being able to wake up on the Sunday and being able to attend a service where your presence is already flowing it is Lord such a blessing because because in your presence there is a fullness of joy and in in your presence everything is possible father we thank you for coming Lord father into this appointment and Lord we are human being very limited to our own ability being through the weeks with a fight with the devil left and right but Lord we pray that now may the word take preeminence in our heart in our mind Lord may you move everything every trial of the enemy a sad completely from this place May Lord father the Holy Spirit Come the inside teacher and minister to your children we commit everything unto their hand bless us Lord father be the beginning and the end of this service in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen let's go to the book of Psalm chapter 82 again still there by God's grace amen amen glory to God since the opening of the seals the Bible became a new book praise God hallelujah amen let's keep those two by God's grace jop to verse six if you can trying to save time because we got to get into deep stuff amen verse six the Bible says I have said we already pray now so we good I have said ye are gods and all of you are children of the most high but you shall die like men and fall like one of the princess you might be seated the first thing here is God declared that we are Gods amen amen and the second thing God is saying that we will die there is death like man this man refer to human being amen and fall like one of the like the princes amen if you notice God come first then human come after are we together so before you were human you were [Applause] gods are we together there is a reason why God started by gods first then human amen amen so your first existence started as a God Amen and then you become human in other word God is talking to his children that remember you are God but you would die like human in other word one of this time one of this day you would drop down on Earth and you going to experience death are we together this is not strange language because the problem that we have as human being is how can a God die amen how can a God die amen if it's a God we're looking at somebody who's Eternal Immortal amen but how can a God die it's a god combined with death he doesn't make sense it looks like some of the light are off whoever is back there if you can work it up amen let's stay clear that part so let me handle the devil amen glory to God all right everything is okay stay on the scripture all is well by God's grace amen it looks like brother BR uh uh the Bible is showing us here that we are God but we die like men so the problem is how can God die this thing this thing here happened to the Lord Jesus Christ amen I'm waiting on this the devil is really fighting but by God's grace I'm going to preach this sermon and somebody will be delivered I'm just waiting for the projector have you seen this before because he knows what is coming up amen amen glory to God it's a good son okay the lights are back let's go with a projector and let me know when it's back if not you're going to work with me because I have everything here I just want you to see what I'm reading so we can read together you let me know when you're ready do you want me to exit and then do it again praise God all is well whenever you ready if you can pull the screen back so I can put it up there praise God all right can I go not yet just check somebody's hand say God bless you everything is good you want me to unplug the USB I did unplug the USB let me plug it back again we good the US is back again let's see if I can pick it up technology won't stop me from preaching I just want to see I want you to see what I'm preaching I already pull it up so it's depending on you if it's not I'm move on all right the Bible says that there I have said Year God and all of you are children of the most high amen so in verse six we are gods and in verse seven we die like a man there is a problem right there how can a God die like a man are we together now on my first slide you might see this later in John 5:8 you can take note for those who want to take note amen the Bible say in verse 18 therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him I'm talking about Jesus because what I say is whatever uh uh this question about a god dying is not strange because Jesus Christ was God and Jesus died and as far as the deity of Jesus Christ the Bible says in the Book of John Chapter 5 Verse 18 therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him because he not only has broken the Sabbath but said also that God was his father are we together let's go to John chapter 5 so we can all read together we going the old way I'm going to unplug the USB and you let me know when you're ready amen amen if you dare you can say Amen John 518 the Bible says therefore the Jews sought the more to kill him because he not only had broken the Sabbath but said also that God was his father so the fact of saying that God was his father was a problem follow me carefully why K making himself what equal with God equal with God Bram said that Adam and Eve were equal Amen brother Bram say if was coal with Adam he changed after the fall but before the fall Adam and Eve were the same in other word the one who can be Co equal with a man is his wife so the bride and chist are Co equal that's why Jesus say when you brde pray you tell God call God our father because when you calling God our Father you are approaching God as the second part of God in other word when you come before God In Prayer come to God as a brad as one that is equal with him spoken bad we are not Pentecostal God is not here and I'm here I'm talking to my husband I'm talking to my groom I'm talking to the one from where I came from him and me we are one when you pray you talking to your [Applause] husband what can't the sister talk to her husband trembling if that's the case something is wrong when you talk to your husband you are fine you can even put your hand on him and then it's plain your situation because your desire will go to [Applause] him are we together are we together are we together how can a God die now we found out that Jesus is God yet Jesus died so death doesn't change the fact that Jesus is God that's right let's go to First John 5 I had the scripture on I was trying to save you sometime let's go to John chapter 5 uh chapter 5 1 John chapter 5 verse 20 amen amen we are message believer my friend we are not Pentecostal or Presbyterian we need to believe the eag food and this is not even a quote this is a simple Bible but it turns to become new because of the message because the breaking of the seals make the Bible a new book are we together let's go to First John chapter 5 verse 20 if you dare you can say amen amen let me know when to connect my friend 1 John 5: 20 the Bible says and we know that who the Son of God this is where we got a problem when we say the Son of God we looking at the father and a son the Son of God Amen we understand we know that the Son of God is come that's Jesus Christ the son means he has a father but we just saw that the father and the son are one that's why Jesus say I and my father we are one and the Jews pick up the stone and say uhuh uh uh uh uhuh in other way they understood what he was if he was Gentile we didn't go to hell you need to have this right here God cannot have this so they took Jesus Christ and they wrap him around like this and then they send him to hell and when the devil open the door the package open up and when he look he said ah not this one that's why brother Bram say he beat the devil and took the keese and remov it from there and kick him in the back and turn the door back because Christ went to heav are we together are we together are we together what I'm trying to establish right here is to make you understand that don't be afraid when they say you are God and you will die like man and you will fall like men I mean princess in other word it's normal for you to go through what you want if Jesus ever remain on the throne it would be different but he became like one of us so that in everything he can be the high priest the true Kingsman Redeemer somebody who understands you in every aspect Jesus is divine so are you yes sir Jesus human so are you yes sir Jesus 100% Divine so are you 100 humans so are you he died you are subject to death the same way you woring about Sin he also carry our sins so what's the difference between you and him what is the difference now if I tell you he's God you say if I come back to you I say you are God now I showed you that everything that happened to him happened to you and matter of fact he went to well you will never go to hell [Music] [Applause] I don't think I don't know if I will preach even what I want to preach this is Christ this is you way way way way down here right this is Christ this is you way way down here so we expect this one to be always the top right this one is always higher that's our human conception but this one say the works that I do that's right I don't know if if you understand this one say the work that I do you will do it also even how how can you do something greater than Jesus [Music] [Applause] Christ is my Bible different than yours no how can you do something greater than Jesus Christ how do you do it that's why brother I'm say notice when he created when he was human thing he have to take a substance to make something and brother say now watch when we are creating we don't need anything Hall in other word when you say God is your father you are equal with God what else do you want me to tell you because you can do bigger things than Jesus Christ in other word when they look at your Miracle it's bigger than Jesus but Jesus Is God who can do things bigger than God so if you're doing things bigger than God who are you I'm asking you a question who are you you are who let's go to P2 oh Father help me but Enoch I believe it was something coming up here me see this devil praise God sister Sharon you can go in my office and open my bag you will see a mouse and bring it to me all is well let's go to Psalm 82 ver8 if you thereare you can say amen amen it's going to work my friend don't worry the Bible says eras oh God and do what oh Father arise and judge the Earth for thou shall inherit what all nations we found out through that scripture amen that we got the second coming and the third coming lock there praise God when we we say arz we already explained to you that Aras speak of the second coming we know that right and then he say judge the Earth and that judgment we know it's talking about the third coming we already understand that and then inherit the nation we know this will happen in a millennium amen I was trying to save you all this reading but we don't have any choice we got to do what we got to do Amen Let me see if this will work brother Enoch praise God let's go to few second let's go to the Book of Revelation chapter 20 I already connect Ed Revelation chap 20 stay really really connected this is deep stuff Revelation chapter 20 and let's go to verse four if you thereare you can say amen amen to help you go ahead my friend you almost there to help you let me give you a good background thank you let me give you a big if it works it's okay brother Robert thank you you can just keep it right there with my wife sorry honey I told her she looked good so amen it's called a sense of humor give me a minute let me exit out of here okay now we're good because the reason why it's acting up like this the material is heavy you probably have a cat if I'm not mistaken here and I'm not going to give you a Cod so you are you are taken care of Amen you are loaded don't worry praise God please put your seat Bel because we're going to get into deep stuff right here glory to God go to Revelation 4 as this is coming up Revelation 4 so I'm going to save you time if this popped up so everything else is there Revelation chapter 4 Revelation 44 let me start with two so it makes sense in Revelation 4 verse 2 the Bible says and immediately I was in heaven I was in the spirit and behold a what how many Thrones do we have there there is only one Throne follow me carefully my friend only one Throne only one that's why the Bible say a a throne a a singular only one Throne are we together amen he said there is one Throne was set in heaven and one sat on the water thr how many people are sitting there one one person sitting there oh glory to God now jum to verse four glory to God if you there you can say amen amen the Bible say and run about The Throne where how many 4 and 20 seats that word sit means Throne I don't know why they put sit there so we got one throne and we also have what 24 24 Throne these Thrones are called seats by the correct translation is throne amen we got 21 4 and 20 seats and upon the seat I saw how many Elders 24 so we know who's sitting there so the throne got someone there the 24 seats or Throne got people there it's only 24 are we together 24 ERS amen 24 Elder sitting clothed with white rmen and they had on their head on their head crowns of what gold so we clear here that this is what we have if you go through the remaining of the scripture there is no more Throne amen there is no additional Throne because the remaining is the the four beast and everything else so in heaven follow me carefully the total of Throne we have in is 25 are we together beside 25 there is no more Throne follow me carefully my friend now let's go to Revelation 20 oh Lord glory to God if you dare you can say amen amen Revelation 20 let's go to verse four if you dare you can say amen amen the Bible say and I saw Thrones many Thrones we need to know how many are there but remember in heaven it's only 25 so there is one8 throne and there are 24 Thrones so the only plural Thrones we know in heaven is only 24 that's right and the Only One Singular Throne we know in heaven it's only one a throne are you are we together are we together now the Bible say there are Thrones how are those Thrones plural sir or according to revelation for plural in heaven it's how many 24 let me help you because somebody would say brother stepen that's an interpretation let me make a difference for you are we there jop to I inan Revelation uh 20 right here verse 4 let me see if I can pick it up right here uh job to verse uh 11 so we can make sense for you you there and I saw a singular are we together I'm reading the Bible I saw a singular great what white thr so there is a one again and there are Thrones plural now we understand that this a throne here looks like what it say great white thr a great white one amen now we understand that the great white one we need to know who's sitting there the Bible says and I saw a great white Throne come and him only one person that sat on it from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away that must be only God and there was and there was found no place for who them so we confirm that the throne that we saw in Revelation 4 is a white throne and there is only one person that is sitting there that's God we together but we got Thrones here that are plural or we already eliminated one Throne there is only 24 remaining in heaven I'm going to show you who you are we clear let's go back now to verse one again Lord help me Hallelujah verse uh one uh verse uh four and I saw Thrones plural and they that sat upon them there were people there that already sitting and judgment was given to them and I saw the souls of them that were who beheaded so there are people sitting on Thrones and they are also souls are we together please follow me this is not easy stuff we got people sitting on Throne on Thrones which we would determine how many are there but we got also Souls amen let me read it again because we want to make sure you can get it the Bible says and I saw Souls I saw Thrones and they that sat upon them and judgment was given to them and I saw the souls of them that were beheaded for the witness of Jesus so these are Christian we clear now these are Christian these are not the Jews the Jew is is is a testimony of God but not Jesus amen he said the witness of Jesus and for the word of God Amen and which had not worship the Beast amen neither his image neither had received his Mark upon their forehead or in their hand and they live and Rain the souls those Souls lived and reign with Christ how many years a thousand years so Jesus Christ doesn't Reign himself in the millennium are we together so this Millennial Reign it is crushed with somebody amen and the word rain amen am speak of somebody who is a king are we together because Christ is the king and he's reigning but Christ is not reigning himself he's reigning with somebody let me read it again he say and day we on verse four amen and they lived and Reign they live and reign with who Christ so Christ is reing with somebody and Christ is the kingh and somebody's reing with him who is that person hold off my friend I know where you can go with me let's go slowly he said they rain with Christ how many years a thousand years which is the Millennium jum to verse five if you thereare you can say amen amen the Bible says in verse five he say but the rest of the Dead live not everybody else that was dead they live not again until the what thousands years so everybody else was not there he was only Christ with the his people amen this is until the thousand years were finished this is the first what Resurrection blessed and what holy is he that has passed the what the first resurrection happened in the Rapture are we together are we together are we together so only those that go in the Rapture will be in the Millennium Hallelujah and they will reign with Christ Hallelujah we together are we together they say and they will be uh verse six blessed and holy is he that has part in the First Resurrection on such the second death has no what power the Lake of Fire you won't go to the Lake of Fire the second death has no power but they shall be who priest of God and of Christ these people that are reigning these people that are reigning okay these people that rain it's a it's a day it's a people amen this people reign amen but when they rain they are not just raining they are also preach I'm reading the Bible my friend hold on my friend amen they are also preached the Bible says and when it th year give me one second let me do this Oh Glory to God glory to God I have to take these quotes now but devil all is well glory to God we on verse six the Bible say and they shall reign with him how a th years a th000 year are we there sir and when a th000 years are expired Satan shall be loed out of prison are we together so my point right here we got Thrones and we got a throne a throne we know who there is God but we found out that these thr people were already sitting there and beside those people we got also other people that are reigning with God and those people are priest if those people are preach who are sitting on the Thrones and how many Thrones our day are we together let's go to Matthew Chapter 13 I'm sorry I got to go this way my friend Oh Glory to God he locks me over there and he locks the computer all isra if you dare you can say Amen Matthew 19 let's go to verse 28 Matthew 19 verse 28 if you dare you can say amen amen do this just a minut thank you Jesus Matthew 19 praise God verse 28 and Jesus said to them verily I say unto you that you which had What followed me in the Regeneration when the who son of man shall sit in the throne so who sit how is that Throne one or or plural one so who sits on the throne the son of man thank you Jesus we okay now so the one sitting on the throne is who the son of menen and the son of men we know Jesus Christ huh when he T the people that I'm going to die they say wait a minute who is the son of men we understand that now right he say and the son of man shall sit in the Throne of his what Glory so the son of man is sitting in his throne the son of man has a throne and we know that there is only one a throne and that's where the son of man is we need to know they other the people amen and the son of man shall sit in his throne of Glory of his glory Kama Watch the Throne of his glory amen the Throne of what the Throne of who his glory remember in John 17 you remember remember the prayer of Jesus Christ he said father the glory that you have given me I have also done what remember that my friend and the Throne of his glory let's go now to verse uh uh we are still there come you also shall sit upon 12 Throne judging the 12 tribe of what Israel so we understand here that out of the throne we already have 12 and brother expl to us that the 24 Throne are the 12 Apostle and the 12 patriarch are we clear together follow me carefully I'm going to separate those Throne let's go to the Book of Luke 22 I had all the scripture let's go to the Book of Luke 23 uh 22 praise God Luke 22 Luke 22 verse 29 if you dare you can say Amen amen Luke 22 glory to God verse 29 you there amen Jesus said and I appoint you a kingdom amen as my father has appointed me has appointed to me am amen that you may eat and drink are we together at my table in my kingdom and sit on Thrones plural are we together did he say 12 he says what Throne so when we say Throne it doesn't mean there is no number that's right because Revelation 4 already told us it's 24 are we together and then you shall sit on throne judging the 12 tribe of what Judah the 12 tribe of what Israel of Israel so we found out that the disciple will be sitting on the throne and the disciple are part of the [Music] Bride but they have individual Thrones and the patriarch have individual throne but there is a category of people that reign with Christ but where are they sitting that's where we heading now let's go to First Corinthians 6 stay with me my friend 1 Corinthians 6 Oh Glory to God first Corinthians 6 if you there let's go to verse two I always have a backup my friend amen 1 Corinthian 6:2 if you dare you can say amen amen the Bible says this glory to God do you not know that the Saints plural how many are there plural Saints plural amen the Saints shall judge the what the world are we together sir and if the word shall be judged by you are you not worthy to judge the smallest matter are we together sir are we together yes sir watch verse uh uh three know you not that we shall judge What Angels give me a minute my friend seems like this thing is working now he said no you not that we shall judge Angel how much more things that pertain to what this life so we find out that the Judgment of this world will be done not only by Jesus Christ himself but somebody else will judge the Earth amen and the one who will judge the Earth right here are also Saint am are we together let me see if he pops up again let's see if this will work my friend glory to God one let's go with the second one and then see if it works glory to God that's the hardest one amen we understand that now let's go to Revelation three now that's it it worked that's it my friend now let me start firing now differently are we together are we together this is everything I was giving you so whoever was getting tired wake up let's do our job now we I gave you all of this and I gave you this now amen now let's go this is where we are my friend 1 Corinthians 6 we in Revelation 3:21 the Bible said to him that do what overcometh will I gr to sit with me in what my Throne if that is is that Throne singular or plural singular are we together now are we together now are we together now Jesus didn't say I will make them sit in Thrones let's go back my friend Jesus did say I will make you sit on Thrones you will sit in m and there is only one my Throne which is a throne a white great throne so so these Thrones right here are 24 Thrones because in heaven it's only 24 and one these have the disciple and the Apostle and there is only one Throne that is remaining and somebody is already sitting there but where are we going to seat it seems like every seat is empty but now Jesus say you see where I'm sitting there is still a [Applause] slot are we together not a different Throne not you going to sit in a throne beside me that is car that's not there is 24 Throne the 24 Throne are already occupied and there is one atone the aone have somebody sitting there who is the son of man and he's already sitting there but Jesus said you will sit with me are we together are we together not in 24 that was for the disciple not for us for us we will be sitting with him in my Throne follow me carefully my friend we will sit with me in my throne are we there even as I have what also overcame and I'm set with my father in what his throne he say him and the father are sitting on the throne but when we look at the throne we see one person and the one sitting there is the son of man that's why Jesus say I'm praying father that as me and you are one I want them also to be one amen so that where I am they might be with me I don't know if you get what I'm saying Jesus say him and the father are sitting on the throne our cor man say two people are sitting on the throne that's not the truth when we look we see one person sitting in other word him and his father are one now Jesus said father you know how me and you are one I'm praying that this also G be one with you amen and they will sit with me on the same Throne me and you sit in other word when we go to heaven we know which Throne we belongs to I'm not going to bother the disciple I'm going straight toward the great throne and when I sit there when you look you will see the son of man remember at the beginning we were in him so as we going sitting on the throne we going back to our [Applause] origin I don't know if you get me my friend do you understand what I'm saying in other way there is a throne there and somebody is sitting and they bring spoken word and they say do you have a seat we say we have a seat and when we get to the throne brother Angel will sit there and brother Angel will disappear because to begin with we came from God Amen and we are going back to god sister Z can go

what prophet is it that we have kept his what ordinance so these people were keeping God's commandment amen amen I cannot go faster than this my friend and we have walk how mul mournfully before the Lord of what H so these people kept God ordinances and they were serving the lord but they walk how in other word they were going through hard time they were going through trials when we say Moon F we are talking about crying are we together so it seems like these people were servant of the Lord keeping God's ordinances but suffering and crying every day and going through so many trial until the pressure of the the trial the pressure of the of the test the pressure of the tribulation begin to make them speak certain things that are foolish and when God heard it on when God heard it God didn't want his children to miss their blessing my friend my friend I can't go back with this I know it's the devil who want you to go outside and you going to stand there 30 minutes talking but I got a hand to the devil these people if you tired open the door my friend I ain't going back my friend these people were serving the lord but everything don't work in their life they tried this it's not working they tried this it's not working they say what is going on we serve God we go to church we keep the message why [Music] this glory to God because they were expecting everything to go good because they're doing what God Said to God but in contrary it doesn't go good are we together are we together jum to verse 4 15 they are talking they say now we call the proud water yeah they that work wickedness are set up and yet they that tempt God are even what delivered in other word we are suffering but these unbeliever are prospering we cannot Prosper the people of the world are prospering yet I'm keeping the message I'm doing what brother BR I'm saying but I don't see God every day I'm [Music] crying every day I'm crying remember crying I'm mourning meaning It's associated with [Music] [Applause] tears and the prophet came and begin to re [Applause] [Music] them that that was fully Stu the prophet came and say don't never talk like that and after the preaching of the Prophet now something happened to them let's read the next one verse 16 are we together are we together then that then is after they rebuke yes sir so after they preached the sermon and their heart were touched yes that what we were doing was not right then on they that did what fear the lord spoke often one to what another in other way they changed their conversation I'm giving you time my [Music] friend instead of complaining instead of murmuring instead of crying sister pick up the number and call sisteri and say sister Naomi keep pressing on God want for God is on our side God will hear our praying everything will be okay they begin to encour one another from today never let somebody calling you to complain if you call me it's for encouragement I don't like anything negative [Music] anymore Shake somebody beside you you can't be sleeping now that's the devil Shake somebody beside you are we together are we together are we together are we together amen listen my friend verse 15 16 and they their Fe the Lord begin to do what verse 16 my friend they spoke often to what one another and the Lord did what hearken he hearken and did what heard it and a book of what remember so what they were talking must be pleasing to the Lord that's why the Lord pay attention that now you have good conversation William Marion Bram brother Bram say here they are what discourage the disciple on the road to EMAs and going back what home well we started out we thought he will be all right but we have to go back home now then on the road back off a water as they walk along how discouraged conversation was how right they were talking about what him that is is when he did what appear that is the reason he doesn't appear to so many of us today our conversation is talking about what everything else but change your [Music] conversation remove the argument at home talk about God are we together are we together we are always talking about what we're going to get when we are going to get to what the word done or what is going to do what let our conversation be how on Christ that is when he does what appears and is when you talk about who be speaking about who about Donald Trump about Cala Harris about who Jesus Christ [Applause] can I continue my friend amen can I continue my friend amen he says ask his friend who and his friend was on the road to what he very much how discouraged but when they were pondering on what the scriptures did you notice what they were talking on the what scripture he did what appeared and on the road where Down the What Dark Hours the dark they had every what every hope what gone about that time who came Jesus came on the scene but they didn't know he was who him one more my friend brother Bram say oh it is what too bad continue my friend too bad that the church today doesn't walk in the spirit in the spirit like that more than we do it is that kind of a time that when God do what comes to you in the time of crying he says you know he was on the road to em when cleopas and his friend was doing what speaking and they were doing what talking and what thinking about Jesus that he that he walk out of the what bushes by the side of them and did what walked with them it is why we were what taking upon him the trouble with the word today we are thinking about what everything else but him then we wonder why we don't get what blessings you want to get blessing let's begin to change the conversation [Applause] amen are we together are we together are we together the conversation was so good until he brought the book of [Applause] remembrance father help me let's go to verse 16 my friend and then they that did what 16 fear the lord spoke one to what another and the Lord did what hearken the Lord heard their prayer now their conversation and did what heard it and a book of what remembrance was written before him for them that what fear the lord and that t upon what his name so there was already a book written about them but the book was in storage because of them conversation but the god who's reaching Mercy sent the word and the prophet corrected them and when the prophet corrected them and they went back to land then God went into his shelf are we together and brought up the book of [Music] remance where are we at my friend oh glory to God let's go my friend jop to verse 17 and they say be and they this is God now talking and they shall be what mine say who the Lord of hosts in that day when I make up my Jewel I will spare them as a man spare his own son that did what serveth him then shall you return and do what discern that word discern means distinguish distinguish between the what the righteous and the wicked between him that do what serve God and him that do what Ser in other words God say don't worry now now you're going to see a difference between who serve God and who doesn't serve God because you begin to look at the the men in the world and you thought he was more happier now let me bring the book of remembrance when that book come it's going to do something in your life what is the book of remembrance oh the book of memory father I don't know what to do my friend let's go
