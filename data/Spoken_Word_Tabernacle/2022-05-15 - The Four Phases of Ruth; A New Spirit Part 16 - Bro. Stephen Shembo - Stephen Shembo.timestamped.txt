[1:00:50] in a holy place

[1:01:05] blessed be the name of the lord let's go
[1:01:07] to romans 6.
[1:01:11] lord help me
[1:01:13] because we got to deliver this again
[1:01:18] we stopped last
[1:01:20] sunday on how to get
[1:01:22] sanctified we got to know that amen
[1:01:27] verse 11. if you dare you can say amen
[1:01:30] likewise you reckon you remember this
[1:01:32] last sunday
[1:01:34] reckon you also yourself to be dead
[1:01:36] indeed to sin anybody care
[1:01:39] but alive to god through jesus christ
[1:01:42] our lord our lord
[1:01:44] let not sin therefore
[1:01:47] reign in your mortal body sin is
[1:01:49] somewhere
[1:01:51] but do not let that scene rain
[1:01:54] everybody
[1:01:55] because before sin was raining was
[1:01:57] ruling you
[1:01:58] now that you went through the bar
[1:02:00] through the brazen altar no more let
[1:02:03] that sin rule amen
[1:02:06] that you should obey it
[1:02:08] in the last thereof there are passions
[1:02:10] desire
[1:02:12] neither yield your members as instrument
[1:02:15] of unrighteousness to sin
[1:02:18] we see the verb there that was obeyed
[1:02:22] and we seen the yielding you remember
[1:02:24] that
[1:02:25] and then we are servants
[1:02:28] that was last sunday
[1:02:30] amen
[1:02:32] but yield yourself to god verse 13
[1:02:35] as those that are alive from the dead
[1:02:37] you were dead before in your sin and
[1:02:39] trespasses and your members as
[1:02:42] instrument of righteousness to god
[1:02:45] ever care because your body is a
[1:02:48] billboard
[1:02:54] your body
[1:02:55] is a billboard
[1:02:56] do you know what a billboard is
[1:02:58] do you see when you go on 85 you see the
[1:03:00] sound that say mcdonald's here
[1:03:03] that's a billboard your body is a
[1:03:04] billboard
[1:03:07] in other words your body gives
[1:03:09] information
[1:03:11] it's telling people something
[1:03:14] anybody care
[1:03:15] verse 14 for sin
[1:03:17] shall not have dominion or control
[1:03:21] over you
[1:03:22] for you are not under the law everybody
[1:03:26] here
[1:03:27] but underwater the covenant changed i
[1:03:30] hope you're alive lord help me
[1:03:33] what then shall we sin
[1:03:36] because we are not under the law but
[1:03:38] under grace calvin
[1:03:42] did you see calvin there
[1:03:44] because we are on the grass let's go
[1:03:46] ahead and sing calvinism
[1:03:49] so paul is warning you be careful of
[1:03:52] calvin right here
[1:03:55] in other words you already been
[1:03:57] justified in the other court be careful
[1:04:00] calvin is here calvin is because grace
[1:04:03] is there let's go ahead and leave any
[1:04:04] kind of way we already said by grace god
[1:04:07] forbid
[1:04:08] because that's confidence anybody
[1:04:11] verse 16 know ye not
[1:04:14] that
[1:04:15] to whom you yield yourself
[1:04:19] servant
[1:04:21] to obey his servant you are to whom you
[1:04:24] obey
[1:04:25] whether of sin to death or of obedience
[1:04:29] to righteousness
[1:04:30] but god be thanked that you were the
[1:04:33] servant of sin that was before karma
[1:04:37] but you have obeyed from the heart at
[1:04:39] the brazen altar that form of doctrine
[1:04:42] which was delivered to you somebody
[1:04:44] preached to you
[1:04:46] now after the bears and altar verse 18
[1:04:48] being then made free from sin
[1:04:51] you gave your life to christ you became
[1:04:54] servant down to water
[1:04:56] now you're moving as a servant forward
[1:04:59] hey mark here i speak after the manner
[1:05:02] of man because of the infirmity of your
[1:05:05] flesh the snake is still there for as
[1:05:08] you have yielded your member servant
[1:05:11] to uncleanness and to iniquity to
[1:05:14] iniquity even so yield your member
[1:05:18] servant to righteousness to water
[1:05:21] this is the result you're going to be
[1:05:23] holy to your sanctification everybody
[1:05:25] clear so far job 2 verse 22 but now
[1:05:29] being made free from sin
[1:05:32] and become servant to god you have your
[1:05:35] fruit onto water that's the result and
[1:05:38] the end everlasting water then you get
[1:05:41] into the holiest in other words once you
[1:05:44] move from the other court you go as a
[1:05:46] servant to the holy place and from the
[1:05:48] holy place you go to the holiest there
[1:05:51] you get the baptism of the holy spirit
[1:05:53] everybody cares so far let's go to
[1:05:55] hebrew 10 and then we pray
[1:05:59] i took a little bit of time on the
[1:06:01] announcement so be gracious to me so we
[1:06:04] can deliver this cargo
[1:06:11] these stuff are very very important
[1:06:15] we have been confused a long time in the
[1:06:18] message
[1:06:19] but the time of confusion is over
[1:06:23] amen
[1:06:25] if you dare you can say amen
[1:06:27] verse 16
[1:06:28] this is the covenant you remember this
[1:06:31] that i will make with them after those
[1:06:34] days say the lord the lord i will put my
[1:06:37] law you remember that
[1:06:39] into the heart not a stony heart now
[1:06:42] because you are born with a stony heart
[1:06:45] you remember that
[1:06:46] a heart of flesh and in their minds will
[1:06:50] i write them can you give me a little
[1:06:52] bit brother david
[1:06:54] and the sins and iniquity will i
[1:06:57] remember no more you cross the brazen
[1:07:00] altar
[1:07:01] god take everything and put them into
[1:07:04] the sea of god forgetfulness your sins
[1:07:07] only your iniquity everything that
[1:07:10] you've done god wipe it if you ask god
[1:07:13] after the present altar where is my sin
[1:07:15] god doesn't know where they are
[1:07:18] if you ask your neighbor they can
[1:07:20] remember everything that you need in the
[1:07:22] neighborhood
[1:07:23] not god but i don't care what my
[1:07:25] neighbor think as long as everything is
[1:07:28] good with god
[1:07:29] everybody clear
[1:07:31] verse 18 now where remission of of this
[1:07:35] is remission of sin there is no more
[1:07:38] offering for water
[1:07:40] because now we're dealing with the cross
[1:07:44] one time the offering is made it's over
[1:07:47] by christ
[1:07:48] verse 19
[1:07:50] having therefore brethren

[1:14:34] now my subject this morning
[1:14:36] [Music]
[1:14:38] is the four phases of roof
[1:14:41] a new spirit
[1:14:45] the new spirit happened where
[1:14:47] in a holy place
[1:14:48] hey back here so we're dealing with roof
[1:14:52] following the maiden
[1:14:54] roof
[1:14:55] dealing with the table of the showbread
[1:14:57] and under that we're still in the holy
[1:14:59] place which is dealing with wesley
[1:15:01] everybody so far
[1:15:03] in our language tabernacle here
[1:15:07] we are with roof in the holy place
[1:15:10] this is where we place roof which is
[1:15:12] this gentle blood that is moving forward
[1:15:15] to receive rest and later on being
[1:15:18] rewarded with the rapture hey but here
[1:15:21] when we started this journey in the
[1:15:23] middle of faith we included ezekiel
[1:15:27] hey but here by including ezekiel we
[1:15:31] inserted the new heart
[1:15:34] you ready on the computer
[1:15:36] the new spirit
[1:15:38] uh back here
[1:15:40] and
[1:15:41] my spirit which is the holy spirit
[1:15:43] the new heart happened in the other
[1:15:45] court
[1:15:46] the new spirit happened in a holy place
[1:15:49] and the holy spirit happened in the
[1:15:51] holiest of all
[1:15:53] everybody here
[1:15:54] now
[1:15:55] how do you read
[1:15:57] the tabernacle as a summary before we
[1:16:01] move on
[1:16:04] number one roof
[1:16:06] is in the other court
[1:16:08] everybody here
[1:16:10] roof
[1:16:11] in the other court this is our way the
[1:16:14] way our reading goes
[1:16:15] roof first of all is in the other court
[1:16:19] anybody care
[1:16:21] roof in the other court means roof is
[1:16:24] deciding
[1:16:26] are we clear there
[1:16:28] roof deciding how do you decide
[1:16:33] you decide at the present although
[1:16:36] everybody care where you give your life
[1:16:38] to jesus christ hey mark here
[1:16:41] this decision here
[1:16:43] have three components to it
[1:16:46] there is a time of decision
[1:16:51] there is a power of decision
[1:16:54] and there is a result of decision
[1:16:57] brother branham preached the time of
[1:16:59] decision
[1:17:00] brother want to preached the power of
[1:17:02] decision and brother branham preached
[1:17:04] the result of decision there is a time
[1:17:07] in your life
[1:17:09] that you must come and make contact with
[1:17:12] jesus christ as the perfect atonement
[1:17:16] for your salvation
[1:17:19] everybody here
[1:17:20] that time and the experience that will
[1:17:23] happen at the president got power to
[1:17:27] change you
[1:17:30] everybody here so far
[1:17:32] and when the changes happen it doesn't
[1:17:35] happen outside
[1:17:38] it is a change that happened inside of
[1:17:41] you and the result will follow ladder
[1:17:44] everybody cares so far
[1:17:46] so roof deciding after she decides she
[1:17:50] is justified
[1:17:54] everybody
[1:17:56] there has roof under justification
[1:18:00] everybody here so far
[1:18:02] everybody cares so far
[1:18:03] this justification
[1:18:06] gives you a new heart
[1:18:10] everybody here so far
[1:18:12] this is the message of luther
[1:18:16] everybody here
[1:18:18] any deviation for luther any relaxation
[1:18:22] from luther will bring you to coven roof
[1:18:26] in the other court deciding at the
[1:18:28] present altar after decision she is
[1:18:32] justified and she moves into the level
[1:18:35] to be baptized and when she is baptized
[1:18:39] she's showing outside people
[1:18:41] that she has already made a decision
[1:18:44] inwardly with her lord and that
[1:18:47] experience gives you a new heart which
[1:18:49] is the message of luther and any
[1:18:52] deviation give you calvin this is your
[1:18:54] first reading any questions so far
[1:18:58] we're clear
[1:19:00] number two we got roof
[1:19:02] in the holy place
[1:19:04] roof in the holy place means what
[1:19:08] according to hebrew chapter 9 verse 1
[1:19:12] the bible say that then verily the first
[1:19:14] covenant
[1:19:16] had also ordinances of divine services
[1:19:20] and a worldly sanctuary
[1:19:22] for there was the tabernacle made the
[1:19:26] first tabernacle which we know paul
[1:19:28] called that the holy place
[1:19:30] wherein was the candlestick
[1:19:33] the table
[1:19:35] and the showbread which is called the
[1:19:37] sanctuary now when these things were
[1:19:40] that's or then the who
[1:19:43] so when you finish
[1:19:46] your present although
[1:19:48] ever here you are entering this
[1:19:50] presentator not under the levitical
[1:19:53] priesthood
[1:19:56] you are entering that you are entering
[1:19:58] this present altar under the melchizedek
[1:20:01] priesthood
[1:20:03] because the mercury that priesthood make
[1:20:06] you priest
[1:20:08] and water
[1:20:09] and king so you are entering the holy
[1:20:12] place as a priest
[1:20:15] everybody here
[1:20:16] as a priest to do service
[1:20:20] unto the lord that's why roof is
[1:20:22] laboring
[1:20:25] i'm helping you to summarize everything
[1:20:28] we started up to this point so we can
[1:20:30] move forward but here it is roof that is
[1:20:34] surfing
[1:20:35] ever here
[1:20:37] this serving of roof when she enter she
[1:20:41] first meet the candlestick
[1:20:44] and it's very important to meet the
[1:20:47] candlestick because the candlestick will
[1:20:50] give you the absolute
[1:20:53] amount
[1:20:55] [Applause]
[1:20:55] [Music]
[1:20:57] hallelujah
[1:20:59] he said the priest went always into the
[1:21:02] first tabernacle accomplishing the water
[1:21:06] so you are entering the holy place for
[1:21:08] service
[1:21:10] as a servant of god roof serving
[1:21:13] and you need to go first at the
[1:21:15] candlestick to get your absolute for
[1:21:18] your edge
[1:21:23] hallelujah what are we talking about
[1:21:26] brother branham say i am not trying to
[1:21:29] absorb authority
[1:21:31] or something like that
[1:21:34] but you see a man
[1:21:36] or anything with two heads
[1:21:40] he doesn't know how to go
[1:21:43] you cannot have two
[1:21:46] head pastor in one church
[1:21:52] everybody okay
[1:21:54] you cannot have a committee
[1:21:57] directing a church
[1:22:02] anybody okay so far because when you got
[1:22:05] two heads or seven heads like the beast
[1:22:08] in revelation you don't know which
[1:22:10] direction you're going
[1:22:13] god is one god
[1:22:16] here your israel the lord your god is
[1:22:18] water
[1:22:21] brother bonham say
[1:22:22] god never did had two heads to his
[1:22:26] church
[1:22:28] he never did it's only
[1:22:32] he always dealt in every generation
[1:22:36] as i have studied through the scripture
[1:22:38] there is always
[1:22:41] one individual that he deal with
[1:22:44] because when you get to man you get
[1:22:47] water
[1:22:48] and it's got to come to one final water
[1:22:52] and my absolute is the water
[1:22:55] the world which is water
[1:22:59] [Music]
[1:23:02] everybody okay so far
[1:23:04] i'm gonna rock you up a little bit
[1:23:06] and as a pastor
[1:23:09] here of the church
[1:23:11] my absolute is the water
[1:23:14] and i know you our brother you kinda
[1:23:18] look to me to be your water
[1:23:23] everybody okay
[1:23:25] everybody okay so far the baba is your
[1:23:28] absolute
[1:23:30] but for your age your messenger
[1:23:35] do you follow me your messenger is your
[1:23:38] absolute
[1:23:40] [Music]
[1:23:44] why is a messenger an absolute
[1:23:48] everybody okay so far
[1:23:50] everybody okay so far are you all right
[1:23:54] why is the past why is the messenger in
[1:23:56] absolute he said i to be your absolute
[1:24:01] as long as i do whatever
[1:24:03] [Applause]
[1:24:05] how many believe brother branham follow
[1:24:07] christ
[1:24:13] everybody here so far
[1:24:15] why because our spouse said the
[1:24:17] scripture you follow me as a follower
[1:24:22] brother branham follow jesus christ
[1:24:26] when paul is following christ and you
[1:24:30] are following paul
[1:24:32] you are not really following paul
[1:24:35] you are following the class that paul
[1:24:38] followed
[1:24:44] the messenger is the absolute when he
[1:24:48] follow christ
[1:24:50] because now it is no longer the
[1:24:53] messenger it is crushed in the messenger
[1:24:57] reflecting his life to the church
[1:25:02] [Applause]
[1:25:06] we found out that when a man comes
[1:25:10] sent from who ordained of who
[1:25:14] with the true water
[1:25:16] the message and the messenger are one
[1:25:20] and the same
[1:25:27] because jesus is sent
[1:25:30] to represent the save the lord word by
[1:25:33] word so he
[1:25:35] and his message is what
[1:25:39] [Music]
[1:25:47] i was trying to spare you that
[1:25:49] but somebody's struggling
[1:25:53] somebody's struggling
[1:25:58] i believe it's 15.
[1:26:00] brother robert
[1:26:03] would you help me with that scripture
[1:26:09] moses is read every sabbath
[1:26:15] everybody here out to 15 let's go to
[1:26:18] verse 21.
[1:26:19] if you dare
[1:26:22] you can say amen
[1:26:24] everybody care
[1:26:26] everybody here
[1:26:27] i want you to read the word for me
[1:26:29] for god
[1:26:33] oh
[1:26:36] moses was who
[1:26:39] for moses of all time
[1:26:43] has in water
[1:26:46] damn god do what
[1:26:49] stop where they're preaching moses
[1:26:57] when you were going to the synagogue
[1:26:59] did you see them standing and saying
[1:27:01] moses moses moses moses moses moses go
[1:27:04] home
[1:27:08] they were preaching the law
[1:27:11] [Music]
[1:27:13] the law of moses
[1:27:15] ever care
[1:27:16] about
[1:27:17] but the bible called that moses
[1:27:22] not moses the man
[1:27:25] but moses the prophet
[1:27:28] more this the lord
[1:27:31] because the messenger
[1:27:33] and his message are one and the same
[1:27:39] that's why brother branham said you are
[1:27:41] not feeding on the word of amen
[1:27:44] you are feeding upon the unfailing body
[1:27:47] world of the water
[1:27:53] every sabbath
[1:27:55] they have to read moses
[1:27:57] on the pulpit
[1:28:01] so when you come to church they say
[1:28:03] moses said
[1:28:05] moses said
[1:28:06] moses said moses said moses said
[1:28:11] even when they meet jesus christ they
[1:28:14] say moses said
[1:28:17] and in this church brother branham said
[1:28:20] brother branham said brother branham
[1:28:23] said
[1:28:31] hallelujah
[1:28:32] paul say
[1:28:33] in romans 2 in the day when god shall
[1:28:37] judge what
[1:28:39] the secret of men by whom according to
[1:28:43] water
[1:28:44] did paul heard the gospel
[1:28:50] did paul heard the gospel
[1:28:52] why did he say my gospel
[1:28:54] in other words when jesus christ judge
[1:28:56] you
[1:28:57] he cannot judge you without me paul
[1:29:02] that's why when brother branham was up
[1:29:05] there he said are those of paul gonna
[1:29:07] enter
[1:29:11] [Music]
[1:29:14] i preach like water
[1:29:20] paul said if they judge you jesus christ
[1:29:22] judge you he won't judge you without me
[1:29:25] i have to be there
[1:29:30] everybody here
[1:29:31] what is the message of paul and back
[1:29:34] here first timothy according to the
[1:29:37] glorious water
[1:29:39] of the blessed water
[1:29:41] which was committed to water
[1:29:45] it is the gospel of god it is the
[1:29:48] message of god that was given to paul
[1:29:51] when he comes to paul paul and the
[1:29:54] message are one
[1:29:57] that's why paul said if somebody come
[1:30:00] and preach something different then what
[1:30:03] me power preaching
[1:30:05] chase that preacher away
[1:30:11] everybody here
[1:30:13] ever hear the candlestick you must go
[1:30:16] here to find your absolute
[1:30:19] and your absolute is not a man it is the
[1:30:22] message of the hour that came through
[1:30:25] your messenger
[1:30:26] [Music]
[1:30:28] and you cannot separate the message from
[1:30:31] the messenger
[1:30:32] you bring in confusion
[1:30:36] [Applause]
[1:30:41] this is what we believe in this church
[1:30:44] and it's gonna stay like that until
[1:30:46] jesus come
[1:30:48] [Music]
[1:30:53] hallelujah
[1:30:54] hallelujah
[1:30:56] when you enter the holy place
[1:30:58] you go to the candlestick
[1:31:00] the candlestick shoots you to the table
[1:31:03] of the showbread
[1:31:05] but here when you go interact with the
[1:31:08] table of the showbread it's going to
[1:31:10] shoot you to the altar
[1:31:12] those three interactions
[1:31:15] sanctify you
[1:31:18] hence
[1:31:19] roof under sanctification roof serving
[1:31:24] roof in the holy place and
[1:31:26] sanctification
[1:31:27] give you the new spirit
[1:31:33] and this is the message of wesley
[1:31:36] and every deviation from wesley bring
[1:31:39] you into armenianism
[1:31:42] second part any question so far
[1:31:47] three roof in the holiest
[1:31:50] yes
[1:31:52] roof in the whole yes she entered
[1:31:55] how does she enter into the holiest god
[1:31:58] help me hallelujah he said into the
[1:32:01] second

[1:32:05] went the water
[1:32:10] hey nobody could enter this place
[1:32:15] only the high priest
[1:32:17] but thank god melchizedek came down
[1:32:21] in the person of jesus christ and jesus
[1:32:24] became our high priest
[1:32:26] and he ripped the veil of the temple
[1:32:29] that's why paul said come and journey
[1:32:32] come not fearfully come boldly and enter
[1:32:37] the holy of holies
[1:32:38] why because the holy ghost did signify
[1:32:42] that the way into the holiest of all was

[1:32:47] while the first tabernacle was yet water
[1:32:50] he needed jesus christ over here you're
[1:32:53] going to meet the ark of the covenant

[1:33:06] the ark of the covenant something will
[1:33:08] happen to you it will put my spirit
[1:33:13] this is not the the the restoration of
[1:33:16] gift but it's the restoration of the
[1:33:19] person himself of the holy spirit
[1:33:23] everybody here so far
[1:33:26] i hope you will get that

[1:37:28] the kingsmen of cornelius
[1:37:31] and the close friend of cornelius

[1:38:08] cornelius all of them were sanctified
[1:38:13] why because all of them receive the holy
[1:38:16] spirit
[1:38:19] i want to see it that's a deduction
[1:38:22] let me see if i can see it
[1:38:24] act 10 verse 15 and the voice speak unto
[1:38:28] him again the second time what god has
[1:38:31] wanted
[1:38:33] that called not the water
[1:38:35] all of them god gave peter the vision of
[1:38:39] the house of cornelius
[1:38:41] and the friend of cornelius and the
[1:38:44] kingsmen of cornelius when peter looked
[1:38:47] he thought they were unclean
[1:38:49] because they were gentle god said all of
[1:38:51] them are sanctified
[1:38:56] but here
[1:38:57] then peter opened his mouth and said of
[1:39:00] the truth i perceive that god is no
[1:39:03] respecter of water
[1:39:04] but in every water
[1:39:07] he that do water
[1:39:09] and work of water roof working roof
[1:39:13] working
[1:39:20] here
[1:39:21] so cornelius justify
[1:39:24] sanctify working already righteousness
[1:39:27] roof serving
[1:39:29] everybody okay
[1:39:31] he's accepted with him brother branham
[1:39:34] saying jehovah jarrah in the house of
[1:39:36] cornelius
[1:39:38] when peter went in and showed him about
[1:39:41] the vision he saw from the housetop
[1:39:44] if you know the story
[1:39:46] peter sin who
[1:39:48] he seen who
[1:39:50] and them he seen what
[1:39:52] all of them were what
[1:39:55] that was the son of the messiah the
[1:39:58] resurrection while peter spoke this word
[1:40:01] the holy ghost fell on water
[1:40:06] everybody okay ain't it too bad today
[1:40:10] that our
[1:40:11] heart our what
[1:40:13] [Music]
[1:40:18] the hearts tony
[1:40:20] you are still outside
[1:40:22] so brother branham is telling you that
[1:40:24] cornelius and his friend already have a
[1:40:27] new heart
[1:40:31] anybody okay a stoney heart can we
[1:40:34] tender ourself up
[1:40:37] because with a stony heart there is no
[1:40:39] way
[1:40:40] you can move with god
[1:40:41] god have to put his law but he need the
[1:40:44] heart of the flesh and cornelius was
[1:40:47] justified sanctify that's why as soon as
[1:40:51] peter spoke the holy ghost fell
[1:40:54] my message what i'm trying to tell you
[1:40:56] you can never receive the holy ghost if
[1:40:59] your life is not clean
[1:41:03] [Music]
[1:41:08] they are not lost
[1:41:10] you are not lost
[1:41:12] you are saved
[1:41:14] certainly sanctification is the same
[1:41:16] work of grace the same
[1:41:18] the same grace that save you jesus said
[1:41:21] no man can come to me except my father
[1:41:23] joseph it is the holy spirit all along
[1:41:27] but that is a portion of the holy spirit
[1:41:31] this is a water
[1:41:33] of the water
[1:41:35] sanctification is the biggest portion of
[1:41:39] the holy spirit
[1:41:40] it is bigger than the other coat
[1:41:47] that's why
[1:41:48] sanctification most of the time is
[1:41:51] mistaken to the baptism of the holy
[1:41:54] ghost
[1:41:57] that's where
[1:41:58] message believer are stuck in
[1:42:01] let's see what's going on
[1:42:03] you ready
[1:42:04] whether you are born in a message
[1:42:07] or outside of the message you must enter
[1:42:10] by one gate brother kelly
[1:42:13] you must meet jesus christ at the cross
[1:42:16] you follow me
[1:42:18] because all both of you your heart are
[1:42:20] bad
[1:42:22] everybody here
[1:42:23] after the present hunter you change and
[1:42:26] you receive a what a new heart
[1:42:31] listen to me carefully
[1:42:34] the one who comes from the world
[1:42:38] has an easy way
[1:42:42] to see a change
[1:42:47] because they were filthy
[1:42:49] they were smoking they were drinking
[1:42:52] they were wearing paint they were
[1:42:54] wearing shorts they were at the beach
[1:42:56] with bathing suit all kind of tight and
[1:42:59] everything they can tell quickly that
[1:43:02] something changed
[1:43:05] everybody here if somebody never
[1:43:07] believed the message before when they
[1:43:10] come through the message and they give
[1:43:12] their life to jesus christ
[1:43:15] you can tell quickly that's that person
[1:43:17] changed
[1:43:19] amen
[1:43:21] because that person would take earring
[1:43:23] off
[1:43:24] that person would take one makeup off
[1:43:27] that person would take the pants off
[1:43:30] that person would keep uh
[1:43:32] change their haircut they would stop
[1:43:34] smoking all those stuff the change is
[1:43:37] they themselves can tell that i was bad
[1:43:41] now i'm changing
[1:43:43] and those people
[1:43:47] have an easy road
[1:43:49] to move quickly to the holy ghost
[1:43:57] ever here
[1:43:58] the biggest trouble is the one who was
[1:44:01] born in the message
[1:44:03] [Applause]
[1:44:06] never smoke
[1:44:08] never smell a nightclub
[1:44:11] never drunk any beer or whiskey
[1:44:14] was never in a movie theater
[1:44:19] [Music]
[1:44:21] what is happening
[1:44:23] there is two form of sanctification
[1:44:27] [Music]
[1:44:29] thank you
[1:44:30] there is sanctification by training
[1:44:38] i hope everybody is awake
[1:44:41] all sanctification by learning
[1:44:47] and there is a sanctification by
[1:44:50] experience
[1:44:55] with the holy spirit
[1:44:59] amen everybody here so far
[1:45:02] sanctification by training is what
[1:45:05] happened to message children
[1:45:12] everybody here
[1:45:14] you are sanctified not by god
[1:45:22] the bible said bring up a child
[1:45:25] in the way that he should go
[1:45:28] so you are sanctified by the training of
[1:45:31] your parents
[1:45:36] everybody
[1:45:37] your parents sanctified the outside of
[1:45:41] you
[1:45:49] your parents touch you since you are a
[1:45:52] child don't worry pants
[1:45:56] your parents said you cannot pinch your
[1:45:58] ear
[1:46:00] your parents said we don't go to the
[1:46:02] movie theater
[1:46:04] but here everything to you came as a
[1:46:08] lawyer
[1:46:21] are you following me
[1:46:23] it is a school master
[1:46:25] that will lead you to christ
[1:46:30] do you follow me
[1:46:32] your father didn't mean hormone
[1:46:39] mama didn't mean harm
[1:46:42] they were doing the best
[1:46:44] to keep you away from satan
[1:46:50] but sometimes you thought they were
[1:46:52] abusive
[1:46:57] you interpret them have been too hard
[1:47:01] [Music]
[1:47:04] ever here they were trying to block you
[1:47:08] not to go to the bad road
[1:47:11] but they have to do it that way
[1:47:14] you need the download
[1:47:19] [Applause]
[1:47:23] do you follow me
[1:47:24] you needed a mama that tells you you
[1:47:26] must wake up and go to church
[1:47:29] it's he was under the law
[1:47:32] everybody here
[1:47:34] everybody here you are going to church
[1:47:37] not because you want to go to church
[1:47:41] because if you don't go to church you
[1:47:43] get in trouble with daddy
[1:47:47] hey but here
[1:47:48] hey here and your parents did the best
[1:47:52] without beingness
[1:47:56] but here they didn't know
[1:47:58] the difference between westlake and
[1:48:01] armenian
[1:48:03] so some went into the extreme
[1:48:06] and became abusive
[1:48:12] do you follow me but they didn't mean to
[1:48:14] abuse you
[1:48:16] they didn't mean to put you as a
[1:48:18] prisoner they were trying the best that
[1:48:21] they can
[1:48:23] to block you from not going to the bad
[1:48:26] way
[1:48:27] not going with the bad friend not
[1:48:29] getting the bad influence because they
[1:48:32] already seen things far off
[1:48:35] but they have to do it by training
[1:48:38] according to the word of god
[1:48:43] because the law is a school master
[1:48:46] that must bring you into what
[1:48:49] it was the law that brought roof into
[1:48:52] the
[1:48:53] field of boaz
[1:48:56] everybody okay so far
[1:49:00] are you talking about i was born in a
[1:49:02] message
[1:49:03] in acts 22
[1:49:05] verse 3 the bible say
[1:49:07] i am verily a man which i am a jew
[1:49:12] born in texas
[1:49:15] a city of water
[1:49:18] i was born outside of israel
[1:49:21] once you say that to the jews
[1:49:25] do you know the
[1:49:26] law everybody here
[1:49:29] paul changed he said yet

[1:49:54] toward water

[1:50:24] persecuted this way unto water
[1:50:28] binding and delivering into prison both
[1:50:31] men on water how can you be taught in
[1:50:34] god and persecute god
[1:50:39] because when christ meet paul he said
[1:50:41] paul paul why are you what
[1:50:45] but paul was taught in the law of christ
[1:50:47] he was crushed that gave the law
[1:50:49] ever here

[1:50:52] the quickest way for you to understand
[1:50:55] that you are not born again
[1:51:02] can i continue the quickest way for you
[1:51:05] to understand
[1:51:06] that you never met jesus christ in this
[1:51:10] message because you were born
[1:51:12] you have enmity between you and the
[1:51:15] message
[1:51:20] [Music]
[1:51:21] do you follow me
[1:51:23] when they preach the message on the
[1:51:25] pulpit
[1:51:27] the message come to you
[1:51:29] as something that disturbs you
[1:51:33] the message comes to you as a law
[1:51:38] all the time don't do this don't do this
[1:51:41] don't do this don't do it's too much
[1:51:44] when your heart thinks like that
[1:51:47] you have not met jesus christ yet
[1:51:53] let me repeat it again
[1:51:56] you were born in a message fine
[1:51:58] if when you are born in a message if
[1:52:01] when they preach the message ever here

[1:53:04] you have not met jesus christ here
[1:53:08] but here
[1:53:09] but here that's why you have a tendency
[1:53:12] to fight against the message
[1:53:16] if they say put the skirt here you will
[1:53:19] put it here
[1:53:20] if they say put it here you will see
[1:53:22] yours goes here

[1:54:18] yet in this message
[1:54:22] [Music]
[1:54:26] i wish the whole church was born here
[1:54:29] and you will see that you are not even
[1:54:30] born again
[1:54:32] what am i saying
[1:54:34] my manner of life from my water i was
[1:54:38] born into the message
[1:54:40] from my youth i know i know the seals
[1:54:42] are not the trumpet
[1:54:44] anybody here as long as the trumpet
[1:54:46] don't rob you you good
[1:54:48] if they start rubbing you you react
[1:54:52] you are in enmity with the message
[1:54:55] that's why
[1:54:56] anything that will shake you away from
[1:54:59] the message
[1:55:00] when you leave the message you put
[1:55:03] don't be surprised somebody left the
[1:55:05] message and they're wearing paint they
[1:55:07] were not they never met jesus christ
[1:55:09] before you gave them the holy ghost
[1:55:13] you are the one that gave them the holy
[1:55:14] ghost they didn't have the holy ghost
[1:55:20] amen you met them at the church 40 years
[1:55:23] that's the way they dress but they never
[1:55:26] sat and take a decision
[1:55:31] and right here they were sanctified by
[1:55:34] training
[1:55:35] and learning that he was under the law
[1:55:38] he was heavy
[1:55:41] they need just one quote when brother
[1:55:43] branham said a sister second way a
[1:55:45] little tight oh they will jump on that
[1:55:53] everybody here
[1:55:54] [Laughter]
[1:55:56] my money of life from my wife which was
[1:56:00] at first among my own mission at
[1:56:03] jerusalem known on water
[1:56:06] everybody knows you you were born in a
[1:56:08] message these people believe the message
[1:56:10] but here
[1:56:11] which knew
[1:56:13] me from the beginning
[1:56:15] if they would testify that after the
[1:56:18] mosque
[1:56:21] of our water
[1:56:23] training
[1:56:25] sanctification by training
[1:56:29] is religion
[1:56:34] that's what paul have
[1:56:37] anybody here
[1:56:38] straight paul everything straight if you
[1:56:42] look at paul he looks like he doesn't
[1:56:43] have any sin
[1:56:45] let's see if paul doesn't have any sin
[1:56:48] i leave a pharisee
[1:56:50] brother uh the bible continues i thank
[1:56:52] christ jesus our lord who has enabled me
[1:56:56] for that he counted me faithful putting
[1:56:59] me into the ministry
[1:57:01] who was before a what
[1:57:05] how can a man that was born in the
[1:57:08] jewish religion
[1:57:09] taught a jewish religion at the
[1:57:11] straightest sect
[1:57:13] pharisee of the pharisee
[1:57:16] under gamaliel a good teacher
[1:57:20] but
[1:57:21] paul found out that he was a blasphemer
[1:57:27] karma
[1:57:28] and a water
[1:57:30] karma and the water
[1:57:34] if you met paul you would have given
[1:57:35] paul the holy ghost
[1:57:39] because he was born into it
[1:57:41] but paul figured out when he met christ
[1:57:44] that no
[1:57:47] i was a blasphemer
[1:57:49] i was bad
[1:57:50] i was as bad as the drunker
[1:57:53] at the nightclub
[1:57:57] everybody here
[1:57:58] i persecuted but i obtained mercy
[1:58:02] because i did it hell
[1:58:04] in what
[1:58:06] how can paul be trained in the law and
[1:58:09] yet have unbelief
[1:58:14] born in the law grew in the law trained
[1:58:17] in the law under a great teacher in the
[1:58:20] law yet unbelief and belief means paul
[1:58:22] was a sinner
[1:58:27] that's why you can be born in this
[1:58:28] message
[1:58:29] and they can train you sanctify you by
[1:58:32] training by learning by religion but
[1:58:36] you're still a sinner
[1:58:41] a sinner the way you will see it look
[1:58:44] your disposition with the message
[1:58:47] you will see that once in a while you
[1:58:50] and the message you bap you you you bad
[1:58:53] heads
[1:58:57] i'm going slowly everybody here
[1:59:00] the grace of our lord was exceeding
[1:59:04] abundant with faith and love with which
[1:59:07] is in jesus christ this is a faithful
[1:59:09] saying and worthy of all water
[1:59:12] that christ jesus came into the world to
[1:59:15] save who
[1:59:17] of whom i am water
[1:59:19] [Music]
[1:59:22] if they take you to the life of power
[1:59:25] you won't find anything wrong
[1:59:29] but paul said i was not only a sinner
[1:59:33] in other words when you see the gangster
[1:59:35] on the street
[1:59:37] ever here and they're going with the
[1:59:39] bike and all the hell hanging out the
[1:59:42] top chief
[1:59:43] per se even though i look clean i was
[1:59:46] like that person already
[1:59:51] but sitting under religion
[1:59:54] so the problem is the one who was born
[1:59:57] here ever here usually is sanctified by
[2:00:01] the training of the father
[2:00:04] or the parent
[2:00:06] but here but he's still as filthy as the
[2:00:10] one that came from the street
[2:00:14] about here
[2:00:16] and this person has a tendency to think
[2:00:20] that he doesn't have anything to do
[2:00:22] anymore
[2:00:24] [Music]
[2:00:26] everybody here
[2:00:27] when a sinner come in the church oh and
[2:00:30] now the young people come in the church
[2:00:32] he's quick to tell her she's not
[2:00:34] dressing well she's not doing well in
[2:00:36] other words she's good
[2:00:40] she can point the other one
[2:00:43] she can see the stuff that is in the
[2:00:45] somebody's eye but she cannot see on her
[2:00:48] own
[2:00:53] everybody okay
[2:00:54] everybody okay but the one that come
[2:00:56] here would turn around and say i was
[2:00:59] smoking i don't smoke anymore and that
[2:01:02] person have a tendency to to move that's
[2:01:04] why brother branham said even in the
[2:01:06] praying line a prostitute will come
[2:01:09] and get healed quickly
[2:01:12] than somebody who was in the church
[2:01:18] what i'm saying is what
[2:01:21] forget about your birth
[2:01:24] your mommy your daddy was in the message
[2:01:27] or not in the message forget about that
[2:01:30] check yourself
[2:01:32] and examine yourself
[2:01:34] what is your disposition toward the way
[2:01:38] toward the message
[2:01:40] he will tell you whether you already
[2:01:43] made a decision with christ or not if
[2:01:45] not you're gonna spin around in this
[2:01:48] church for so long
[2:01:52] what am i saying then
[2:01:54] if sanctification that was by training
[2:01:57] or learning but there is another
[2:01:59] sanctification which is the
[2:02:01] sanctification by experience
[2:02:06] what is that sanctification
[2:02:09] remember here
[2:02:10] the bible uh brother branham say as many
[2:02:13] as i love i rebuke and trust him be
[2:02:19] this is the same message that john had
[2:02:23] uh had as he cried out to that religious
[2:02:26] with uh uh wilderness of pharisee and
[2:02:30] sadducee and hidden telling them
[2:02:34] pharisees knew the law
[2:02:37] sadducee knew the law
[2:02:40] the difference between them was in
[2:02:42] doctrine
[2:02:44] let me put it home pharisee is a message
[2:02:48] believer
[2:02:53] did you hear me
[2:02:54] a sort of a message believer
[2:02:57] sadducee is another form of message
[2:03:01] believer
[2:03:02] the difference between them is their
[2:03:04] doctrine one belief jesus already come
[2:03:08] one say he doesn't come one believe the
[2:03:10] thunder one believe the return ministry
[2:03:13] that's the difference between them
[2:03:17] everybody okay so brother branham is
[2:03:20] telling you that the message of john was
[2:03:22] with the people the religious people
[2:03:26] and the different doctrine and the
[2:03:28] hidden who didn't know anything
[2:03:31] the person born in the religion and the
[2:03:34] person from the street
[2:03:36] but all of them repent
[2:03:41] i was born under a return ministry
[2:03:43] church repent
[2:03:44] i was born under dignity that believed
[2:03:47] god was made flesh repent i was born
[2:03:50] under the thunder movement repent i was
[2:03:53] born under jesus is coming three times
[2:03:56] repent
[2:03:57] i was born in the ghetto repent
[2:04:07] there was nobody cause them there is no
[2:04:10] other course now there was no other way
[2:04:14] to get back to god and there is no other
[2:04:16] way now it is what
[2:04:19] change your what
[2:04:21] do whatever
[2:04:24] check
[2:04:26] how you bad heads with the messenger
[2:04:28] so you gotta repent means you gotta
[2:04:31] change your heart toward the message
[2:04:36] because you are batting against jesus
[2:04:38] christ
[2:04:41] but here
[2:04:42] paul the bible says this we're moving to
[2:04:45] the candlestick let's take ephesians 4.
[2:04:50] hallelujah
[2:04:52] i'm trying to run quickly
[2:04:58] because many that are born in the
[2:05:00] message give themself the holy ghost
[2:05:07] and they give other people the holy
[2:05:09] ghost
[2:05:10] and the people that they think they have
[2:05:12] the holy ghost are the people that deal
[2:05:14] good with them
[2:05:17] that's a good sister she has the holy
[2:05:19] ghost
[2:05:20] the day that she said her bad heads that
[2:05:23] sister doesn't have the holy ghost
[2:05:24] anymore
[2:05:28] let's go to ephesian four
[2:05:31] if you dare you can say amen
[2:05:34] i hope it's helping you
[2:05:37] this is not a transfer
[2:05:39] from an old church to this and we
[2:05:41] continue
[2:05:43] you come from the old church we stop we
[2:05:45] need to check the host
[2:05:47] we need to evaluate everything because
[2:05:50] we don't want again to go through what
[2:05:52] we went
[2:05:54] amen
[2:05:58] everybody here
[2:06:00] 17 amen
[2:06:02] this
[2:06:03] i say therefore and testify in the lord
[2:06:07] that
[2:06:08] you
[2:06:09] here after everybody
[2:06:11] walk not
[2:06:12] as other gentile work in the vanity of
[2:06:16] the water
[2:06:17] from now on
[2:06:19] you came from the present altar
[2:06:21] do not walk like gentle again
[2:06:24] how do gentle walk verse 18 having the
[2:06:28] understanding water
[2:06:30] darken
[2:06:31] yeah it's there having the understanding
[2:06:33] darken
[2:06:35] being alienated from the life of god
[2:06:37] through their water
[2:06:39] remember paul said he was also ignorant
[2:06:42] said there is an ignorance under
[2:06:44] religion and there is an ignorance under
[2:06:47] hedonism
[2:06:48] both of you need to repent
[2:06:51] but here
[2:06:52] through ignorance that is in them
[2:06:55] because of the blindness of the heart
[2:06:57] who being past feeling have given
[2:07:00] themselves over to lasciviousness all
[2:07:02] kind of sensuality
[2:07:04] and work all uncleanness with greediness
[2:07:07] they still want to do something bad
[2:07:10] but
[2:07:10] you have not so do what
[2:07:13] paul is telling you now this is not the

[2:07:26] way you deal with christ how do you deal
[2:07:28] with christ if verse 21 if if so be that
[2:07:33] you have heard him and have been water
[2:07:36] taught by him as the truth is in jesus
[2:07:40] that you pulled off
[2:07:42] concerning the former what
[2:07:45] that word conversation means the manner
[2:07:47] of life
[2:07:48] the old man
[2:07:50] that you were before
[2:07:51] which is corrupt according to the
[2:07:54] deceitfulness
[2:07:56] according to the deceitful last and be
[2:07:58] what
[2:08:00] into the water
[2:08:02] of your water

[2:08:23] in your water
[2:08:25] you need to have a new spirit
[2:08:29] you already got a new heart
[2:08:31] don't do again the things that you were
[2:08:33] doing before
[2:08:34] but remember your next step you need a
[2:08:37] new spirit

[2:08:56] after you are renewed in the spirit and
[2:08:59] that you put the water
[2:09:02] you cannot put the new man without the
[2:09:05] new spirit
[2:09:08] do you follow me
[2:09:10] watch the board
[2:09:11] you cannot put
[2:09:13] the new man
[2:09:15] the holy ghost is a person you cannot
[2:09:18] put the new man
[2:09:20] without the new spirit paul is saying
[2:09:23] you already got a new heart you need to
[2:09:25] receive a new spirit and once you
[2:09:28] receive the new spirit then you can put
[2:09:31] on the new man
[2:09:34] that new man is how verse 24 and that
[2:09:37] you put on the new man kama which is
[2:09:41] after who
[2:09:42] is what
[2:09:44] it's a man that have been created
[2:09:47] you are now converted
[2:09:49] back here that is created in
[2:09:52] righteousness and in true water in other
[2:09:55] words you can never receive the holy
[2:09:57] ghost
[2:09:58] if you have not first
[2:10:01] received a new spirit
[2:10:06] what are you trying to say
[2:10:08] brother stephen
[2:10:10] this is what i'm trying to say
[2:10:12] brother branham say when we enter
[2:10:15] sanctification he said the next step she
[2:10:18] had to do she had to do water
[2:10:20] she become a water
[2:10:23] not the law of moses but the law of
[2:10:26] christ and but here she had to work out
[2:10:30] her own salvation with fear and water
[2:10:33] as you did
[2:10:34] she was trying to find favor with boaz
[2:10:38] so she worked her way through the stage
[2:10:40] of water roof under sanctification
[2:10:44] laboring means water
[2:10:46] how do you get sanctified
[2:10:49] this is it now
[2:10:50] elect
[2:10:52] according to the full knowledge of god
[2:10:54] the father through sanctification of
[2:10:56] water
[2:10:58] not sanctification by training
[2:11:00] or learning
[2:11:02] or religion now with sanctification by
[2:11:04] there
[2:11:05] which is sanctification by an experience
[2:11:08] how do you get sanctified
[2:11:10] sanctification by the spirit onto
[2:11:13] obedience
[2:11:15] remember the word obey right there
[2:11:18] and sprinkling of the water
[2:11:21] the blood is the word
[2:11:23] which is washing you
[2:11:24] how do you get sanctified
[2:11:26] you go to the
[2:11:28] uh uh table of the showbread
[2:11:31] we talk about the showbread having the
[2:11:33] frankincense you remember now right
[2:11:37] this is where we stopped last week
[2:11:40] what is the work that you have to do
[2:11:43] as roof laboring
[2:11:44] roof under sanctification roof being
[2:11:47] legalistic work on the work
[2:11:50] brother branham said work is first
[2:11:52] expressed you remember this
[2:11:54] everybody here
[2:11:55] what show that faith has already worked
[2:12:00] works is showing you
[2:12:02] that the faith
[2:12:04] that started at the president
[2:12:06] everybody here
[2:12:08] is working in other words if you don't
[2:12:10] produce work
[2:12:14] hey mark here
[2:12:15] you what you did at the president did
[2:12:18] not work
[2:12:21] do you follow me again
[2:12:23] do you follow me again if you give your
[2:12:25] life to jesus christ and you try to move
[2:12:28] forward and you don't see any changes in
[2:12:32] your life
[2:12:33] something is wrong where you started
[2:12:35] because when you take a decision there
[2:12:38] is a power with that decision
[2:12:41] everybody okay so far
[2:12:44] brother branham continue he says
[2:12:47] shows that faith has already took a hold
[2:12:50] we talked about rahab who believed and
[2:12:53] she produced work
[2:12:55] what is work
[2:12:57] you ready
[2:12:59] grace everybody okay
[2:13:01] is what god did for me
[2:13:04] i want you to listen closely

[2:13:35] somebody they didn't spit on you they
[2:13:37] beat somebody they didn't beat you
[2:13:39] christ did all the package he did it for
[2:13:42] you that is grace
[2:13:45] ever here you have nothing to do inside
[2:13:48] of there
[2:13:49] jesus never told you to come be included
[2:13:52] he never told you to go at the cross
[2:13:54] with you he never told you to be whipped
[2:13:57] he didn't tell you anything he started
[2:13:59] and he finished it without you
[2:14:00] that's grace
[2:14:02] everybody okay
[2:14:04] what is work the first definition of
[2:14:06] work we found out that it was faith
[2:14:09] expressed
[2:14:10] anybody here the second definition of
[2:14:13] work is what
[2:14:17] work
[2:14:18] is what i do for god
[2:14:28] what
[2:14:30] you
[2:14:31] do for god
[2:14:34] anybody care
[2:14:36] what how do you do it
[2:14:40] now
[2:14:40] they shall make a doctrine out of it
[2:14:43] brother branham is catching you
[2:14:45] because by default
[2:14:48] man always tried to do something
[2:14:50] when adam fell the first thing he tried
[2:14:53] to do something
[2:14:54] god said take your hand off
[2:14:57] take your hand off of them this is what
[2:14:59] i gave you in the old testament you made
[2:15:02] a mess take your hand off you ended up
[2:15:04] with pharisees sadducee herod take your
[2:15:07] hand off
[2:15:08] number one remember i did everything for

[2:15:12] keep that in mind
[2:15:13] number two you gotta do something how do
[2:15:16] you do it
[2:15:17] and what
[2:15:19] is the
[2:15:20] benefit of doing it
[2:15:23] and what does it do in your life
[2:15:25] are you ready
[2:15:28] they shall make a doctrine out of it
[2:15:30] they think that work
[2:15:32] is what wins your water
[2:15:38] if it is it is not a water
[2:15:43] this work
[2:15:44] you are not doing it to gain something
[2:15:50] are we okay
[2:15:52] remember i told you there is hell
[2:15:54] there is heaven
[2:15:56] there is punishment you remember that
[2:15:58] and there is reward
[2:16:00] ever here if you do
[2:16:02] work to win heaven
[2:16:05] wrong
[2:16:08] i'm going slowly
[2:16:09] if you do work because you are afraid
[2:16:12] you will go to hell
[2:16:14] wrong
[2:16:15] if you do work because you want to get a
[2:16:18] reward from god
[2:16:20] wrong
[2:16:21] if you do work because if i don't give
[2:16:24] that i'm going to get whip
[2:16:26] wrong
[2:16:27] you better keep your thoughts
[2:16:30] and god will whip you anyway
[2:16:33] everybody okay everybody okay
[2:16:36] you do it not to marry something
[2:16:40] but how do i do it without meriting
[2:16:44] in other words you are doing this are
[2:16:47] selfish
[2:16:53] help me brother stephen
[2:16:55] grace
[2:16:56] is what god did for you
[2:16:59] by
[2:17:00] yourself
[2:17:02] and work is what you do
[2:17:06] in
[2:17:07] appreciation
[2:17:09] of the grace that he showed you
[2:17:14] that's why paul
[2:17:16] keeps saying as you moving
[2:17:19] keep your profession
[2:17:21] remember your profession in other words
[2:17:23] never lose the sight of the present
[2:17:26] altar of that day that you give your
[2:17:29] life to jesus christ but here whatever
[2:17:33] you do i'm doing it because of what he
[2:17:36] did for me
[2:17:38] i was a bad man
[2:17:40] i was casting everybody
[2:17:42] i could not tolerate everybody i was
[2:17:45] somebody that nobody could even approach
[2:17:48] i was a nobody but because of jesus
[2:17:51] christ i am what i am
[2:17:53] and because of what he did to me
[2:17:57] in appreciation to that
[2:18:00] i'm gonna do this
[2:18:02] period
[2:18:04] let me continue
[2:18:06] brother of adam say work is what you do
[2:18:10] in appreciation of the grace that he
[2:18:13] showed you
[2:18:14] if you do what
[2:18:16] you like to do the work of who
[2:18:19] take your bible so he help you here
[2:18:23] get mark chapter 12.
[2:18:26] so this will sink in
[2:18:28] because this is a very fine line
[2:18:31] that if you don't pay attention you will
[2:18:33] find yourself in armenia
[2:18:37] and then you begin to boast
[2:18:41] we don't wear those kind of dresses like
[2:18:43] that
[2:18:46] have you heard that before
[2:18:48] somebody's boasting
[2:18:49] their holiness
[2:18:53] everybody here
[2:18:54] they're boasting their holiness
[2:18:57] right
[2:19:01] let me leave it alone let's go to verse
[2:19:05] mark 12 28.
[2:19:07] if you're there you can say amen
[2:19:09] you there
[2:19:11] and one of this crap came
[2:19:13] as having heard them reasoning together
[2:19:16] and perceiving that he answered them
[2:19:18] well ask him which is the first
[2:19:20] commandment of all
[2:19:22] i read you some other places but not
[2:19:24] this one
[2:19:26] and jesus answered him to the best of my
[2:19:28] knowledge the first of all the
[2:19:30] commandment is heal o israel the lord
[2:19:33] your god is water
[2:19:35] and you shall love the lord your god
[2:19:37] with all your
[2:19:39] karma with all your
[2:19:42] come out with all your
[2:19:44] karma with all your
[2:19:46] this is the first commandment
[2:19:48] and the second is like you remember this
[2:19:51] namely this
[2:19:53] you shall love your neighbor as yourself
[2:19:56] there is no other commandment greater
[2:19:59] than what
[2:20:01] you remember this watch the next verse
[2:20:04] and the scrub said to him
[2:20:07] well master
[2:20:08] you have said the truth
[2:20:10] for there is no one god
[2:20:13] and there is no other but he you can
[2:20:16] make jews swallow three gods
[2:20:18] verse 33
[2:20:20] and to love him
[2:20:22] everybody okay
[2:20:24] with all the heart
[2:20:26] with all the understanding brother robin
[2:20:29] and with all the soul
[2:20:32] and with all the strength and to love
[2:20:35] his neighbor he's summarizing what jesus
[2:20:37] told him amen
[2:20:39] and with all and to love his neighbor as
[2:20:42] himself
[2:20:43] watch what jesus didn't give him
[2:20:46] but he caught it by revelation
[2:20:49] watch that
[2:20:50] because everybody heard it
[2:20:53] but what they were looking for give us
[2:20:55] one commandment and we do it but that
[2:20:58] one commandment that jesus gave them
[2:21:00] still had the revelation
[2:21:03] locked in now the man is unlocking the
[2:21:05] revelation jesus never told him that
[2:21:08] it's coming from the man himself
[2:21:11] ever here watch the revelation is more
[2:21:15] than all
[2:21:17] hope burn offering and what
[2:21:20] did jesus told him that
[2:21:22] where did he get that
[2:21:26] watch verse now 34 and when jesus saw
[2:21:30] that he answered what
[2:21:33] he said to him you are not what
[2:21:37] from water
[2:21:38] because you approach you right here
[2:21:42] am i here jesus told him what you just
[2:21:45] say

[2:31:44] you yet
[2:31:45] anybody here
[2:31:47] legalism won't let me do it
[2:31:50] is because that i know i get punished
[2:31:53] for doing
[2:31:56] but the real truth of it is when the
[2:31:59] love of god
[2:32:01] comes into your heart
[2:32:03] till you want to do it
[2:32:06] that is the truth of it

[2:32:15] stake right in the middle
[2:32:17] what am i doing
[2:32:18] brother stephen because
[2:32:21] you would love him so much to think that
[2:32:24] he loved you so much when you were
[2:32:27] unlovable and before you had anything to
[2:32:30] do with it
[2:32:31] you chose he chose you
[2:32:34] how could you turn anything down like
[2:32:36] that
[2:32:39] why he looks to me like that would just
[2:32:42] set that would set election so much
[2:32:46] higher than the law
[2:32:47] he would he would set he would set
[2:32:50] legalistic idea why he would just go
[2:32:54] beyond anything to think that when i was
[2:32:57] unlovable he loved me and to think when
[2:33:00] i had nothing i could do about it he
[2:33:03] picked me up and save me of his grace i
[2:33:07] surely should be grateful enough
[2:33:10] to do what
[2:33:12] to serve him and love him so that is the
[2:33:15] way we feel about him when we count the
[2:33:17] blessing water

[2:43:27] hallelujah hallelujah and when the habit
[2:43:30] take away the atmosphere you have been
[2:43:34] created
[2:43:35] you created a chain
[2:43:40] do you follow me
[2:43:42] you follow me
[2:43:43] that chain does something to the snake
[2:43:48] do you follow me
[2:43:49] the snake that was activist bound
[2:43:54] [Music]
[2:43:58] do you follow me
[2:43:59] do you follow me brother branham said
[2:44:02] when they say that the devil will be
[2:44:05] banned for one thousand years with a
[2:44:08] chain
[2:44:10] by the venom said it doesn't mean the
[2:44:12] angel is coming with a big shed and
[2:44:14] bandage you know like that that's not
[2:44:16] the way you do
[2:44:17] brother branham said it is the chain of
[2:44:19] circumstances
[2:44:21] you created an atmosphere around your
[2:44:24] life until the devil cannot handle that
[2:44:29] anymore
[2:44:30] it is an atmosphere that paralyzed the
[2:44:34] snake
[2:44:35] follow me carefully
[2:44:38] brother branham says this
[2:44:41] oh
[2:44:42] how we need in jeffersonville
[2:44:45] thousands of water
[2:44:47] that is the water
[2:44:50] thundering out in water
[2:44:53] and what
[2:44:54] and what
[2:44:56] and what
[2:44:57] walking around in earth today without
[2:44:59] water
[2:45:01] yes sir real water
[2:45:03] that is a thunder against the snake
[2:45:07] everybody okay
[2:45:08] the devil don't care how loud you can do
[2:45:11] what
[2:45:12] in jesus name in jesus name
[2:45:15] you're making him stronger
[2:45:17] everybody
[2:45:18] the devil don't care how much you can
[2:45:20] jump how much you can do this or shout
[2:45:23] but what
[2:45:27] everybody here is to see what
[2:45:32] everybody okay
[2:45:33] a sanctified
[2:45:35] holy life consecrated to god say
[2:45:38] anything to him call him anything just
[2:45:41] as sweet as he can be so the herding of
[2:45:44] the snake is the life that you are
[2:45:47] producing as an appreciation
[2:45:50] to the things god did for you
[2:45:53] but here
[2:45:54] as you doing that towards god
[2:45:58] it is hurting the devil
[2:46:00] it is in other words you begin to beat
[2:46:02] the snake you beat the snake you beat
[2:46:04] the snake you don't beat it like in
[2:46:06] jesus name in jesus name no
[2:46:09] because the more you pay attention to
[2:46:11] him the more he's going to bite you
[2:46:13] forget about him what did brother
[2:46:15] branham say brother branham said don't
[2:46:17] wear a tight dress do i have that dress
[2:46:20] god i love you so much if this is what
[2:46:22] you want no problem that dress
[2:46:25] go to salvation army
[2:46:27] something say you know you look sexy
[2:46:30] don't worry
[2:46:31] don't worry about that person
[2:46:33] even if the desire is still there
[2:46:37] because he will try to tell you you say
[2:46:39] you still have the desire
[2:46:41] you still longing for that that's not my
[2:46:43] problem i already did that in obedience
[2:46:47] period
[2:46:49] not in feeling
[2:46:50] in obedience your feeling will not be
[2:46:53] there
[2:46:54] when you do it
[2:46:55] don't focus on the feeling keep focusing
[2:46:58] on the action you did father i did this
[2:47:01] not because of me you told me that's why
[2:47:04] i did it
[2:47:05] after a while
[2:47:07] you will hear that voice quieten
[2:47:10] you have overcome that demon
[2:47:14] then you move to the next demon then you
[2:47:17] come to church then he exposed the
[2:47:19] second one before you know it you find
[2:47:21] yourself a different person
[2:47:24] amen and you will look at the same that
[2:47:26] dress and you say how was i wearing
[2:47:28] something like this
[2:47:32] everybody
[2:47:33] you don't even understand why you change
[2:47:36] the reason why you begin to question why
[2:47:38] you change because what happened to you
[2:47:41] you got a new spirit
[2:47:52] any question
[2:47:55] what does the new spirit do
[2:47:58] now that spirit is not god's spirit
[2:48:02] that is your spirit
[2:48:05] god gives you a new spirit
[2:48:08] then he say i shall put my spirit in you
[2:48:12] but the thing
[2:48:13] god has to do is give you anew
[2:48:18] make your nature
[2:48:20] a little more
[2:48:22] and water
[2:48:23] or he could not even live with you
[2:48:28] so he has to get you fixed up first
[2:48:32] before he can come in
[2:48:34] i will give you a new spirit then you
[2:48:37] take him anywhere
[2:48:39] you go all play kind of places
[2:48:42] he's got to get you fixed so you can
[2:48:45] entertain him well
[2:48:50] so you will see
[2:48:52] a big change happening in you
[2:48:54] compared to before
[2:48:58] you begin to love coming to church
[2:48:59] quickly

[2:57:00] please obey
[2:57:02] when you're obeying
[2:57:03] it's not obeying according to your
[2:57:05] desire
[2:57:06] because you still have a snake
[2:57:08] your desire will be contrary to what
[2:57:11] they want you to obey
[2:57:13] in other words what god asks you to do
[2:57:15] is different than what you want to do
[2:57:17] you feel tired you want to stay home but

[2:57:45] brother ebo was stored after the doctor

[2:57:50] his back again
[2:57:52] 30 minutes later the doctor came back in
[2:57:55] and said there was no evidence of a
[2:57:57] broken back they sent him home still in
[2:58:00] pen but no breakage
[2:58:08] everybody
[2:58:10] who did that
[2:58:16] now when brother able have to come to
[2:58:18] church in appreciation to the one that
[2:58:21] prayed that heal his back
[2:58:26] how many blessings do you have in your
[2:58:28] life
[2:58:29] how many times you miss
[2:58:31] death in a hospital bed
[2:58:33] how many times people you heard people
[2:58:35] die with coronavirus
[2:58:37] there is a whole lot to look at that and
[2:58:40] because of that god that is giving you
[2:58:42] the breath of life
[2:58:43] don't do it because you must do it
[2:58:46] wrong
[2:58:47] take your hand off
[2:58:49] don't pay attention to what's going on
[2:58:51] don't pay attention to yourself
[2:58:53] pay attention to the cross
[2:58:55] and do what they ask you to do obey
[2:58:58] regardless of how you feel
[2:59:00] keep obeying
[2:59:02] that thing will leave you
[2:59:04] let's pray heavenly father
[2:59:06] lord we thank you again father for your
[2:59:08] grace
[2:59:09] for your love and for your mercy
[2:59:12] and for everything you have been doing
[2:59:14] for us
[2:59:15] father we struggle years
[2:59:19] not even understanding these things
[2:59:23] sometimes
[2:59:24] we drop into a channel
[2:59:27] when we begin to read our bible we begin
[2:59:29] to pray more
[2:59:31] and suddenly we see things going we
[2:59:33] don't even understand
[2:59:35] and if we would have caught those key
[2:59:37] quickly
[2:59:38] we would have removed a lot of stuff off
[2:59:40] our life and our life would have been
[2:59:43] painless
[2:59:45] without much effort
[2:59:47] without seeing the christian life like
[2:59:49] it's a burden
[2:59:51] but the christian life would have become
[2:59:53] a joy and something that we live for
[2:59:57] and something that we are
[3:00:00] father
[3:00:01] many of the habit have hanged around the
[3:00:04] people
[3:00:05] until they got so discouraged
[3:00:08] because they are reminding them that it
[3:00:10] seems like there is no progression in
[3:00:12] their christian life
[3:00:14] they're still moving up and falling
[3:00:16] moving up and falling moving up and
[3:00:18] falling like the man that came to you
[3:00:22] and you ask him did you give your life
[3:00:24] to jesus christ and he was talking to
[3:00:26] you he was talking to the prophet about
[3:00:28] the cigarette
[3:00:30] until brother branham turned around and
[3:00:32] told him forget about the cigarette
[3:00:35] look into christ
[3:00:36] and when they baptized the man
[3:00:39] only a few times
[3:00:41] brother branham said go buy him a
[3:00:43] cigarette
[3:00:44] and put it on his desk he's not going to
[3:00:46] touch it
[3:00:48] and that was the end of cigarette
[3:00:50] nobody cuts the devil
[3:00:52] but these are laws and keys
[3:00:55] that you left for your children
[3:00:57] further so that you can make this labor
[3:01:01] not a labor
[3:01:02] of law
[3:01:04] not a labor of suffering and pain
[3:01:07] but it's a labor of love
[3:01:09] where we're working in the field of
[3:01:11] boars
[3:01:12] the one who love us
[3:01:15] the one who understand us
[3:01:17] the one who told us to go get a drink
[3:01:19] the one who purposely sent the reapers
[3:01:22] one after one
[3:01:23] dropping blessings here and there
[3:01:26] until we understand that you know what
[3:01:28] really it's not even a work
[3:01:31] he just want me to build something
[3:01:33] that's why he want me to do this
[3:01:36] because many maidens
[3:01:38] were laboring in that field
[3:01:40] roof found them in that field
[3:01:43] but none of those maidens became the
[3:01:45] wife of boaz
[3:01:46] they were stuck into that sanctification
[3:01:50] they were stuck into that legalistic
[3:01:53] nobody could progress
[3:01:55] and they remain maiden
[3:01:57] workers in the field and roof who came
[3:02:01] from an outside country only spent a few
[3:02:04] times with them in the holy place
[3:02:06] and after a while roof left that field
[3:02:09] and never came back again to work
[3:02:12] the other remain
[3:02:13] maiden
[3:02:14] roof was the wife of boaz and they were
[3:02:17] now working for roof
[3:02:19] father we found many people in this
[3:02:22] message
[3:02:23] we found many people in many stages
[3:02:26] but further this is not the time to get
[3:02:28] stuck on the stage this is the time that
[3:02:31] you are calling us to a higher calling
[3:02:34] where you want us to meet you into the
[3:02:36] holiest
[3:02:37] so that further our life will be a life
[3:02:40] of rest
[3:02:41] so that we won't have to worry about
[3:02:44] what next step what to do because it's
[3:02:46] not us directing our life it is god
[3:02:50] himself living through his brother and
[3:02:53] working his good pleasure according to
[3:02:56] what what he already planned and purpose
[3:02:58] father may your children be yield
[3:03:01] may your children father take their hand
[3:03:04] off and obey may your children give you
[3:03:07] the preeminence may your children
[3:03:10] remember that if they got into this
[3:03:12] message and never even met you or still
[3:03:16] fasting with the message still fasting
[3:03:19] with the coat still fasting with the
[3:03:21] ministry may they take the faces away
[3:03:24] it's as simple as it is stopping
[3:03:27] that altar doesn't have to be in church
[3:03:30] that altar can be in the pig pen
[3:03:32] the altar can be a home
[3:03:35] that alter can be in the living room
[3:03:37] that alter can be on the sideway of the
[3:03:40] highway we don't have to travel all the
[3:03:42] way to jerusalem to find that altar
[3:03:44] because you're the present help in the
[3:03:46] times of trouble father we can meet you
[3:03:49] even in a bush we can meet you at the
[3:03:51] mountain we can go even into a bathroom
[3:03:54] and sit down and just make a contact
[3:03:57] with you and that contact will make a
[3:03:59] difference and from there on lord father
[3:04:02] we will begin to yield we will begin to
[3:04:04] obey we will begin to serve you in
[3:04:07] appreciation to what you have done in
[3:04:09] our life in appreciation father how can
[3:04:13] a young sister stand in this country
[3:04:15] growing and staying years after years
[3:04:18] without flirting
[3:04:20] [Music]
[3:04:23] it is nothing but your grace
[3:04:26] and we appreciate that lord father there
[3:04:28] are many things that we can sit and
[3:04:30] count blessing one by one and we won't
[3:04:33] even have a time to do all further in
[3:04:36] appreciation to your protection in
[3:04:39] appreciation to your blessing in

[3:04:58] us take our hand off
[3:05:01] and leave everything we're struggling
[3:05:03] with and focus on the main thing
[3:05:06] and you will take care of the rest and
[3:05:08] before you know it we will be undo with
[3:05:11] a new spirit
[3:05:12] and ready for the new man
[3:05:15] and at that point we will be resting
[3:05:17] waiting for the coming of the lord
[3:05:19] father we commit everything unto the
[3:05:21] hand and may you take lord father the
[3:05:23] word of baptism lord unto the hand and
