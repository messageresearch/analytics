[29:27] his testimony tonight. Amen. Amen. God
[29:30] bless you all. Amen. So, I had a
[29:33] incident a couple nights ago um where uh
[29:38] I was
[29:39] taking one of our propane tanks that we
[29:41] use for heat uh from the camper that we
[29:45] live in and um uh we were out of propane
[29:49] that night and so I was going to take it
[29:51] to the Dollar General down the road just
[29:53] to exchange it and and get it refilled.
[29:57] So, um, I'm unhooking it and it's dark
[30:00] outside, so I'm I'm not really think
[30:04] I've done it so many times that I I
[30:05] didn't really think of it. And so, I
[30:07] automatically assumed that it was on
[30:09] like that the
[30:10] uh the um what do you call it? The knob
[30:14] on on top was on. So, I turned it all
[30:17] the way off, or so I thought, and I
[30:20] unhooked it from the camper and I took
[30:22] it and I put it in my car and I smelled
[30:24] a little bit of gas, but that's pretty
[30:27] typical. So, I didn't really think much
[30:28] of it, but I put it in the car and I got
[30:32] in and it I smelled gas, but I was like,
[30:35] well, you know, that's typical. It's
[30:36] just it's an empty tank, you know, maybe
[30:39] it's just a little bit that leaked out.
[30:41] So, I get in and I try to crank the car
[30:44] and the battery is completely dead. I'm
[30:47] like, that's so weird. And then it hits
[30:49] me that there's that strong a
[30:52] significantly strong smell of gas in the
[30:55] car. So, I get out and I'm standing
[30:58] there and I'm like, I think the Lord
[31:00] just saved my life
[31:03] because it it just it just hit me all of
[31:07] a sudden. Like, that's it was so strong.
[31:08] So, I pulled the the propane tank out of
[31:10] the car and I shine my flashlight on it
[31:13] and it was a kind of an old tank, so it
[31:15] was a little bit faded and hard to see,
[31:18] but it was turned all the way on. And
[31:20] I'm guessing there was a little bit more
[31:22] propane in there. I thought it was
[31:24] empty. So, um I I just I thank the Lord.
[31:28] I told Lily I said, "Come outside and
[31:30] and smell the inside of this car." And
[31:32] it was just a very thick distinct smell
[31:35] of just strong gas. I was like, "The
[31:37] Lord just saved my life."
[31:39] So, the next or uh earlier today,
[31:44] um I went back out and I hadn't driven
[31:46] the car since then, of course, but um I
[31:50] was going to go jump it out and restart
[31:52] the battery. And so, I just thought I'd
[31:56] put the key in the ignition and, you
[31:58] know, just just just see what happens.
[32:01] Um without actually jumping it out. And
[32:04] the car just cranked right up.
[32:06] And so I was like that that just settles
[32:08] it right there. That that was the Lord
[32:10] that kept me
[32:11] safe. If it wasn't for him, I wouldn't
[32:13] be here tonight. That could have been a
[32:16] bad explosion. But I just wanted to give
[32:17] God all the praise for that. Amen. And
[32:19] amen. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[32:22] Amen. Amen. We want to invite brother
[32:24] Charles II. Amen. um to thank the Lord

[57:39] God, may you may lead this lead in the
[57:41] spirit, Lord God, Jesus Christ. And

[57:45] Amen. Amen. Um, so for our opening of
[57:49] scripture, I wanted to read uh Hebrews
[57:53] 6:13-18. Amen. You know, it's a um it's
[57:57] an awesome thing. You know, every time,
[57:59] you know, it's time for me to preach,
[58:01] you know, no matter no matter
[58:04] how, you know, uh tight I am on time or
[58:07] no matter, you know, however, you know,
[58:09] the Lord always provides a message.
[58:10] Amen. and he provides in his own ways,
[58:12] you know. Um, I was just reading and I
[58:15] hit my heart, you know, the Lord's in
[58:17] Hebrews for some reason. Every service
[58:18] the Lord's hitting on Hebrews, you know.
[58:20] So, I was tired of reading and some hit
[58:22] my heart, you know, and I want to share
[58:24] with you guys, you know, um, so we'll
[58:27] start reading. It's uh, chapter Hebrews
[58:30] 6 verse 13. It reads, "For when God made
[58:34] promise to Abraham, that's right.
[58:36] Because he could swear by no greater, he
[58:38] swore by himself." Amen. saying, "Surely
[58:41] blessing I will bless thee, and
[58:43] multiplying I will multiply thee." Amen.
[58:45] And so after he after he had patiently
[58:47] endured, he obtained the promise. Amen.
[58:51] For men verilely swear by the greater,
[58:53] and an oath for confirmation is to them
[58:56] an end of all strife. That's right.
[58:58] Amen. Wherein God willing more
[59:00] abundantly to show unto the heirs of
[59:02] promise. Amen. To us, he's willing.
[59:04] Amen. willing more abundantly to show
[59:06] unto the heirs of promise the
[59:08] immutability of his counsel confirmed it
[59:10] by an oath that by two immutable things
[59:13] in which it was impossible for God to
[59:15] lie that we might have no strong
[59:18] consolation we might have a strong
[59:20] consolation we might have a strong cons
[59:23] oh I'm sorry I skipped it sorry that by
[59:26] two mut mutable things um in which it is
[59:29] impossible for God to lie we might have
[59:31] a strong consolation who have fled for
[59:33] refuge
[59:34] who have fled for refuge to lay hold on
[59:36] the hope set before us. Amen. So that
[59:39] that's our reading. Amen. And I want to
[59:41] um you may be seated. Seated now. Amen.
[59:44] I wanted to start out with uh just you
[59:47] know going over you know my title is uh
[59:49] God's immutable oath. Amen. And um I
[59:52] want to just you know break down the
[59:54] words you know to see where the title
[59:55] derived from you know. Um so you know an
[59:58] oath is a sworn covenant. Amen. And
[1:00:01] immutable means that it's a we know that
[1:00:04] immutable is uh let me I don't want to
[1:00:06] say it wrong. I have the definition
[1:00:08] here. It says that
[1:00:11] um I'm
[1:00:16] sorry just a second.
[1:00:29] So immutable is you know the the
[1:00:32] attribute of unchangeableness. Amen. You
[1:00:34] know um it won't change. Amen. Uh it
[1:00:37] stays the same. That's right. Amen. And
[1:00:39] um also you know also said that this is
[1:00:42] it is a very important trait for deity.
[1:00:45] Amen. And you know uh deity you know is
[1:00:48] is an expectancy that it will always be
[1:00:50] the same. Amen. It reveals itself in the
[1:00:53] same ways. Amen. It acts the same. Amen.
[1:00:55] And um also uh Lord put this on my heart
[1:00:57] to share with you guys also you know um
[1:01:00] that the Lord will not put more on you
[1:01:02] than you can bear. Amen. That um that
[1:01:05] you know it says in his word you know
[1:01:07] that um uh you know he won't put more on
[1:01:08] us than you can bear. Amen. So whenever
[1:01:10] you're going through something you know
[1:01:12] whatever it is whatever it may be you
[1:01:13] know uh whatever going throughout your
[1:01:15] day you know um uh flat tire makes it
[1:01:18] worse or whatever you know just know
[1:01:20] that you know it happened for a reason.
[1:01:22] Amen. Amen. We you never know. We never
[1:01:24] know why. Amen. But brother Zach's car
[1:01:26] didn't start, you know, for a reason.
[1:01:28] Amen. And and it allowed the Lord had to
[1:01:31] show him why. Amen. Amen. That's, you
[1:01:34] know, his nos are better than his yeses.
[1:01:36] Amen. Amen. Uh you know, so I just
[1:01:38] wanted to take that, you know, um
[1:01:40] because you know that we see in the word
[1:01:43] here that the Lord, you know, swore to
[1:01:46] Abraham by himself. Amen. And we know
[1:01:48] that it wasn't by Abraham's own merits
[1:01:50] that he swore to him. Amen. It's by
[1:01:52] predestination. Amen. It was just
[1:01:54] because Abraham was Abraham Abraham was
[1:01:56] the seed that he chose to work through.
[1:01:58] Amen. Amen. And you know, it's just the
[1:02:01] one of the greatest revelations that the
[1:02:03] Lord showed me was predestination. Amen.
[1:02:05] It's it's so intricate. You just can't
[1:02:09] wrap your head around it. You know, just
[1:02:10] because of his grace. That's it. That's
[1:02:12] all you can really say, you know. Um you
[1:02:14] know, it's brother Benham said that the
[1:02:17] greatest the the Oh, thank you. You hear
[1:02:21] me? Amen. Uh, brother Benham said that
[1:02:24] that uh that the natural birth was more
[1:02:28] mysterious than the spiritual birth.
[1:02:30] Amen. And why why why is that? You know,
[1:02:33] it's because it's because that out of
[1:02:35] all those thousands and millions of
[1:02:37] sperm cells, for some reason, the Lord
[1:02:40] chose you to hit this earth. Amen. And
[1:02:42] for some reason, you know, you know, you
[1:02:45] came to this world and and you were
[1:02:47] exposed to so many different things as
[1:02:48] you were, you know, being raised up. And
[1:02:51] and somehow for some reason, you know,
[1:02:53] you just were uh whole all through your
[1:02:55] life, the Lord was pulling you. Amen. He
[1:02:56] was tugging on your heart. He was
[1:02:58] tugging to this message. Amen. And and
[1:03:00] no matter what your background was, if
[1:03:02] it was any religion, whatever it was,
[1:03:04] Amen. You're here now. Amen. And and it
[1:03:06] was uh he he brought you through, you
[1:03:08] know, all those religions. And then for
[1:03:10] some reason, you uh you you chose to
[1:03:13] stick with the message and you chose,
[1:03:15] you know, this specific church and you
[1:03:17] chose to live in this specific area.
[1:03:19] Amen. and you chose to be here tonight.
[1:03:21] Amen. There's no no such thing as happen
[1:03:23] stance. Amen. It all happens for a
[1:03:25] reason. Amen. So that's
[1:03:27] just give that as a confirmation for
[1:03:30] yourself. You know, never let the Lord
[1:03:32] never let Satan just, you know, um try
[1:03:34] to beat you down. I'm here for a reason.
[1:03:36] You know, Satan's going to attack you,
[1:03:38] but you know, uh the Lord says that he's
[1:03:40] our shield. Amen. And and you know, we
[1:03:42] have the hel helmet of salvation. Amen.
[1:03:45] So just know that you know uh you know
[1:03:47] Satan's going to try to attack you with
[1:03:49] those mind battles. Amen. And and you
[1:03:51] know brother Brennham gives a parable
[1:03:53] you know he says that uh when the crows
[1:03:55] try to roost you know the crows of doubt
[1:03:57] you know try to affect your faith. Amen.
[1:03:59] And I found out you know uh recently a
[1:04:01] little while back that you know a a
[1:04:03] group of crows is called a murder. Amen.
[1:04:05] So you know you don't want them to
[1:04:07] murder your faith. Amen. So and and
[1:04:09] brother Brandham said you know when
[1:04:11] those crows come to shoot them with a
[1:04:12] shotgun. Amen. Um, you know, you have
[1:04:14] the shotgun of this word. Amen. And it's
[1:04:16] it spreads. It spreads over our whole
[1:04:17] life. Amen. It it covers every area of
[1:04:20] your life. It goes into your your your
[1:04:21] your prayer chamber. It goes into, you
[1:04:24] know, your job. It it goes into your
[1:04:26] personal life. It goes everywhere. Amen.
[1:04:27] So, no matter what, just know that
[1:04:29] there's a word somewhere, you know, to
[1:04:31] there's a word somewhere to calm you.
[1:04:33] Amen. There's a word somewhere. Amen.
[1:04:35] So, I want to continue on. Um, so the
[1:04:38] Lord brought it to me. Um, I want to
[1:04:40] break it down uh verse by verse. Amen.
[1:04:42] Um, you know, that's how the Lord
[1:04:44] brought it to me and I like to give it
[1:04:45] to you guys that same way. Amen. So, um,
[1:04:48] I want I like to read a quote. Uh,
[1:04:50] brother Brandham says in Revelations
[1:04:52] chapter 4, number two in 1961, this is
[1:04:56] talking about an oath. Amen. Uh, brother
[1:04:59] Brandham says, "A covenant," and we know
[1:05:01] that a oath is a sworn covenant. Amen.
[1:05:03] And a covenant is similar to a promise
[1:05:06] as well. You know, you see God is
[1:05:08] perfected in threes. Amen. You have his
[1:05:09] oath, covenant, and promise. Amen. Amen.
[1:05:11] We know his word, his word of promise.
[1:05:13] Amen. So, it all comes together. It's
[1:05:15] all the same thing. Amen. Uh, a
[1:05:18] covenant, it says, I'm sorry. It says,
[1:05:20] Brother Benham says, a covenant is
[1:05:21] always made by an oath. That's right.
[1:05:23] Amen. Always. Amen. So, there's nobody.
[1:05:25] And he pauses. He says, you take an oath
[1:05:28] by somebody greater than you. Amen.
[1:05:30] Amen. And why is that? Brother Benham
[1:05:32] says, you take an oath by your mother.
[1:05:34] You take an oath by your nation. You
[1:05:35] take an oath by something. You take an
[1:05:37] oath by God. But you can't take an oath
[1:05:40] unless it's somebody greater than you.
[1:05:41] Amen. There was nobody greater than God.
[1:05:44] Amen. So he took an oath by him oath
[1:05:46] himself by himself. Amen. So he did the
[1:05:49] work for us. Amen. He took an oath by
[1:05:52] himself. He says of himself by himself.
[1:05:55] Amen. Amen. And there's no one greater
[1:05:57] than God. Amen. So it's a consolation
[1:05:59] that we can have. Amen. That no matter
[1:06:01] what, you know, because God said, you
[1:06:03] know, that's why, you know, uh he said
[1:06:05] so. Amen. Amen. So there's no no u you

[1:06:14] all the time? Why are you always you
[1:06:16] know doing things that you do? Because
[1:06:17] God said so. Amen. Amen. Amen. And um so
[1:06:22] we'll continue. Uh brother Brenham says
[1:06:24] you know uh he swore by himself in 1954.
[1:06:28] Um he says referring to it that our
[1:06:30] foundation is solid. Amen. Not some
[1:06:32] mythical builtup something on some pagan
[1:06:35] superstition. But it thus sayeth the
[1:06:37] Lord. Amen. Uh I want to stop here. You

[1:06:40] Masons, we have the all these other
[1:06:42] religions, and they say they have the
[1:06:44] secrets of life. Amen. But we know we

[1:07:30] something on some pagan superstition,
[1:07:32] but it's thus sayith the Lord by an
[1:07:34] oath. Amen. He says, "God take an oath
[1:07:36] by himself. Oh my, how firm a
[1:07:38] foundation." These saints of the Lord.
[1:07:40] Yes. When demons come, when powers come,
[1:07:43] when sickness comes, when death itself
[1:07:45] stays you in the faith, it just loses
[1:07:47] its place. Amen. It melts away like the
[1:07:49] snow in the sunshine. Amen. When we
[1:07:52] throw it in the light of the gospel
[1:07:53] there. Amen. And um also uh another uh
[1:07:56] instance in the scriptures hit me, you

[1:08:04] thing was she she initiated that. Amen.
[1:08:07] The the spies didn't come to her. Amen.
[1:08:10] She heard of their God and she knew they
[1:08:11] were there. We wouldn't know how she
[1:08:13] knew they were there. The Lord showed
[1:08:14] her they were there. Amen. It was by
[1:08:15] revelation. Amen. And she took them in
[1:08:17] and she hid them with the under the
[1:08:18] flax. Amen. And she made them give a
[1:08:22] oath. Amen. And and she initiated that

[1:08:26] She said, "You give me an oath." Amen.
[1:08:28] And and it was a token. Amen. And that
[1:08:30] token was red. Amen. And we know it was
[1:08:32] the scarlet thread. Amen. And we know
[1:08:34] that when the Lord sees, you know, the
[1:08:36] red of our sins and he sees the uh the
[1:08:38] blood, the blood of Jesus Christ, he
[1:08:40] sees white. He sees purity. Amen. And um
[1:08:42] so she initiated that oath. Amen. And
[1:08:46] that's in uh Joshua 12. I want to go to
[1:08:48] Joshua 2 um 12.
[1:08:53] Go to Joshua
[1:08:59] 2:12. Yes, sir.

[1:09:26] is Joshua 2:12. Yes, sir. It reads, "Now
[1:09:29] therefore, I pray you swear unto me by
[1:09:31] the Lord." Amen. So she knows. So she
[1:09:34] she knows how oath works. Amen. She
[1:09:36] knows that, you know, I'm not trusting
[1:09:38] in you. It's not you I'm trusting and
[1:09:40] trusting in the Lord because that's your
[1:09:42] God. Amen. She says she says she says uh

[1:10:12] mother and my brethren and my sisters
[1:10:14] and all that they have and deliver our
[1:10:16] lives from death." So you see this oath
[1:10:18] went beyond just herself. Amen. Th this
[1:10:21] oath went beyond her and all that's in

[1:10:53] immutable. Amen. It never changes. Amen.
[1:10:55] He's bound by his word. Amen. Amen. Um
[1:10:58] so I I would like to uh um continue.

[1:11:04] so so after she made her petition, Amen.
[1:11:08] So after she made her petition in
[1:11:09] prayer, what what what was their
[1:11:11] response? Amen. So 17, it says, "And the
[1:11:14] men said unto her, we will be blameless
[1:11:16] of this thine oath." Amen. Because
[1:11:19] because the Lord is blameless because
[1:11:21] his reputation lies on his word. Amen.
[1:11:24] Amen. So, so, so whenever there's an
[1:11:26] oath that that you hold, you go catch
[1:11:29] him by. Amen. He is duty bound to to
[1:11:32] answer it. Amen. Amen. So, we'll
[1:11:35] continue. It says in verse 17, the the
[1:11:38] men said unto her, we will be blameless
[1:11:40] of this thine oath which thou hast made
[1:11:42] us swear. Amen. Behold, see, listen.
[1:11:46] Behold, when we come into the land, thou
[1:11:48] shalt bind this line of scarlet thread
[1:11:51] in the window. Amen. which thou didest
[1:11:53] let let us down by and thou shalt bring
[1:11:56] thy father and thy mother and thy
[1:11:58] brethren, and all thy father's household
[1:12:00] home unto thee. And it shall I'm sorry.
[1:12:03] And it Yes. And it shall be that
[1:12:04] whosoever shall go out of the doors of
[1:12:06] thy house into the street, his blood
[1:12:08] shall be upon his head. Amen. So, you
[1:12:11] see, as long as you're under the
[1:12:14] protection of the oath, Amen. Nothing
[1:12:16] can touch you. Amen. See, you have to
[1:12:19] leave the oath. Amen. You have to you
[1:12:21] have to leave for Satan to even get to
[1:12:23] you. Amen. Amen. So so that's why we
[1:12:26] have such a strong consolation. Amen.
[1:12:28] Amen. U so we we'll continue. And you
[1:12:32] know um and something else hit me you
[1:12:34] know when I I said you know she was
[1:12:35] speaking to these two his brother Benam
[1:12:37] called them called them preachers. Amen.
[1:12:40] Amen. He said that those two spies were
[1:12:41] preachers. Amen. And something hit me. I
[1:12:44] said you know when you come into the
[1:12:45] house of the Lord you know the the the
[1:12:47] modern day New Testament prophet is the
[1:12:49] preacher. Amen. So, and we know the
[1:12:51] preacher is God's mouthpiece. Amen. So,
[1:12:54] whatever God is saying through that man,
[1:12:56] you hold on to that oath. Amen. Oh, man.
[1:12:58] So, that's why that's why when you when
[1:13:01] you give praise to the Lord, you know,
[1:13:02] uh I have a um my father taught me, you
[1:13:05] know, say you say uh I uh I claim it,
[1:13:07] Lord. That's what you know that that's
[1:13:09] what I say, you know, to let the Lord
[1:13:10] know that I hear him. Let the Lord know
[1:13:12] that I'm holding him by his oath. I'm
[1:13:13] holding him by his word. Amen. For

[1:14:25] thou art a prophet. Amen. Uh he says uh
[1:14:28] it's the most wonder wonderful gift in
[1:14:30] the world to be a minister which was a
[1:14:33] New Testament modern-day prophet, a
[1:14:35] preacher. Amen. And another thing hit
[1:14:37] me, you know, you have to see this word,
[1:14:39] you know, everywhere in your life. Amen.
[1:14:41] So, you know, uh I work, you know, uh

[1:14:45] know, um when I come home and um you
[1:14:48] know, it was hit me and I was stocking
[1:14:49] shelves one day and it hit me. I said,
[1:14:50] "Wow." I said, "You know, when you go
[1:14:53] into a supermarket, are you ever
[1:14:55] expecting not to get what you want?" You
[1:14:57] know, you know, when when you when you
[1:15:00] when you when you walk in those doors,

[1:15:19] know, you know, so I said, you know,
[1:15:21] every time you enter those doors in
[1:15:23] church, you have to come with an
[1:15:24] expectation. Amen. Amen. Because if you
[1:15:28] have the faith, if you have the the
[1:15:30] purchasing power, Amen. then you're
[1:15:33] going to get what you desire. Amen. And
[1:15:35] then if you if you praise him as you
[1:15:37] ought, you know, if if you consecrate
[1:15:39] yourself as you ought to, you already
[1:15:41] know that he's bound by his word because
[1:15:43] I'm coming I'm coming guiltless. I'm I'm
[1:15:45] cuz it's not but my marriage anyway.
[1:15:47] Amen. I'm I'm because your your word
[1:15:50] even says, you know, as you see the day
[1:15:51] approaching, you know, uh come, you
[1:15:53] know, uh uh gather yourself more into
[1:15:55] the house of the Lord. Amen. Amen. And
[1:15:57] I'm just listening to what he said. So
[1:15:59] I'm supposed to get what I need, right?
[1:16:01] Amen. So, you know, so what what hit me
[1:16:05] was, you know, when you enter a
[1:16:08] supermarket, you have the purchase
[1:16:09] power, but you know, the shelves, you
[1:16:12] know, some stores the shelves are empty,
[1:16:14] but when you come to the Lord, he gives
[1:16:15] liberally. He gives abundantly. Amen.
[1:16:17] His shelves are never empty. Amen. Amen.
[1:16:20] So, you you know, you know, so whatever
[1:16:22] you need, you just ask in faith, you
[1:16:24] know, knowing that, you know, he's duty
[1:16:26] bound to give it unto you. Amen. And and
[1:16:28] if he says no, there's a better thing
[1:16:30] coming. Amen. Amen. And you know, you
[1:16:33] know, um,
[1:16:35] so so what what hit me when when I was
[1:16:38] stocking the shelves, you know, it was
[1:16:39] it was, you know, it's the the
[1:16:41] preachers's job, you know, the pastor's
[1:16:44] job, whoever it is, he stocks the
[1:16:46] shelves. Amen. Amen. And and how does
[1:16:49] And how does he do that? Amen. He goes
[1:16:52] into the back. He goes into the back
[1:16:55] where where where no one can see and he
[1:16:58] he gets the goods out and he stocks the
[1:17:00] shelves. Amen. See, it's not it's not
[1:17:03] your job to know uh to ask where'd you
[1:17:06] get it from? You know uh um um you know
[1:17:08] what is it? Amen. We know just go grab
[1:17:11] what you want and take it and keep
[1:17:12] moving. Amen. It's all you have to do.
[1:17:15] Amen. Amen. See, and you know because a
[1:17:19] preacher is a servant to the bride.
[1:17:20] Amen. It's it's their job to labor in
[1:17:23] prayer. It's their job to lay her in the
[1:17:24] word. Amen. To provide the bride with
[1:17:26] what she with with her nutrients. Amen.
[1:17:28] Because the word says the bride has made
[1:17:30] herself ready. Amen. And how does she
[1:17:32] make herself ready? With the word.
[1:17:33] Because she she she shot herself with
[1:17:36] with with the word of the gospel. Amen.
[1:17:37] Amen. So so so there that hit me. It hit
[1:17:40] me strong. I said, you know, uh the
[1:17:41] Lord, you know, you must want me to
[1:17:42] share this with your people. Amen. And
[1:17:44] you know, um and brother Brennham
[1:17:46] continues. He says on the day of Cal,
[1:17:48] that day on Calvary in 1960, he says
[1:17:51] that's why the preacher preaches. That's
[1:17:53] why he studies and meditates in the
[1:17:55] scripture. He seeks for inspiration.
[1:17:57] It's because he's a public servant to
[1:17:59] God's people. Amen. And he is trying to
[1:18:02] find something that will. And he pauses.
[1:18:04] He says that God will have to say to his
[1:18:07] people. Amen. And then so so he so it's
[1:18:10] not it's not a oh Lord, you know, um
[1:18:13] it's time for me to preach, you know,
[1:18:14] just put something together. No, no.
[1:18:16] Because because what did the Lord say
[1:18:19] Sunday? You know, uh don't settle for u
[1:18:21] meteor meteor meteorocity. Amen. We
[1:18:24] don't settle for that. You know, uh you

[1:18:41] restaurant. Amen. It's real good food.
[1:18:43] Amen. So, so, so, so the preachers, they
[1:18:46] have to consecrate themselves to cook up
[1:18:48] a good meal for the bride. Amen.
[1:18:51] Amen. So,
[1:18:54] so we continue and the Lord says uh the
[1:18:57] Lord says through his prophet, he says
[1:18:59] that something would help them. Maybe
[1:19:02] may be condemn them in their sins. Amen.
[1:19:04] Because you know sometime healthy food
[1:19:05] will get your stomach rumbling. Amen.
[1:19:07] And and it says it says uh maybe condemn
[1:19:09] them in their sins, but it will it will
[1:19:12] help to raise them up that they may they
[1:19:14] might forsake their sins. Amen. And
[1:19:16] raise up to serve the Lord and minister
[1:19:18] and should seek these things because the
[1:19:20] Lord says that you know uh he he he
[1:19:22] chasens his children. Amen. And and you
[1:19:25] know those who take the chastisement,
[1:19:27] that's how you know you know you're a
[1:19:29] true child of God. Amen. So so just know
[1:19:32] that you know if you're going through a
[1:19:33] little of brother Ben call the child
[1:19:35] trainings. Amen. And you know, we were
[1:19:38] sitting down talking, you know, um you
[1:19:40] know, you know, the Lord says when you
[1:19:42] think on the Lord, talk on the Lord, he
[1:19:43] comes down. Amen. So, I was talking with
[1:19:45] my family, you know, and just hit it
[1:19:47] just came the Lord came down and they
[1:19:49] were talking about how, you know, when

[1:19:56] you know, um you want you only remember
[1:19:58] the good things of your children when
[1:19:59] they get older. Amen. And if you look in
[1:20:02] the word in the New Testament, you know,
[1:20:04] uh Abraham, you know, he made mistakes.
[1:20:07] Amen. When he was young, he was being
[1:20:08] child trained. He made mistakes. Amen.
[1:20:10] But when he grew up in the faith, Amen.
[1:20:13] You know, in the New Testament, when
[1:20:14] it's recorded, Amen. It says nothing by
[1:20:17] his mistakes. Amen. See, as the Lord
[1:20:19] brings us up, Amen. See, our mistakes
[1:20:22] mean nothing. Amen. Because because, you
[1:20:24] know, um um it's it's like the Lord sees
[1:20:26] his child grow. He's wired them with the
[1:20:29] word. Amen. And and as they grow up,
[1:20:31] Amen, they become stronger and stronger
[1:20:33] to where, you know, when they were on a

[1:20:38] more. Amen. Amen. And and Satan can't
[1:20:41] attack them with level two mistakes
[1:20:42] because they're beyond that. Amen. So,

[1:20:57] five-fold ministry. Amen. In Ephesians 4
[1:21:00] 11 and 11 and 12, you know, he says,

[1:21:44] speaking to you, you claim his word.
[1:21:46] Amen. For his word is a promise to you.

[1:27:36] And something hit me. You know, the
[1:27:37] brother Benham says, you know, work on
[1:27:39] the spur of the moments. Amen. When when
[1:27:41] something hit your heart. Amen. So, he
[1:27:43] was about to walk out the door. I said,
[1:27:44] "Wait, wait, wait. Don't don't leave
[1:27:45] yet." you know, I I I came up to him and
[1:27:47] I and I grabbed him and I prayed and and
[1:27:50] you know, it was just showing, you know,
[1:27:51] and and I made sure to use, you know, uh
[1:27:53] all the scriptures that we've been
[1:27:55] learning in church and you know, you
[1:27:56] know, just you know, making sure, you
[1:27:58] know, that that you know, and I even
[1:28:00] asked the Lord to show them Calvary.
[1:28:01] Amen. Cuz you know, that's how you get
[1:28:03] somebody. Amen. The the mysteries is not
[1:28:05] what you want to get them by. You get
[1:28:06] them by Calvary. Amen. You show them
[1:28:07] Calvary. Amen. Because they got they got
[1:28:10] Everybody has to go through that uh that
[1:28:12] tabernacle. Amen. You can't you can't
[1:28:14] push them in the holiest of holies or or
[1:28:16] the holy place. You know, it's too much
[1:28:17] for him. You know, a b a baby can't eat
[1:28:20] meat. Amen. You can't you can't do that.
[1:28:21] Amen. Amen. So, so you know, I was um I
[1:28:25] prayed for him and then he went home.
[1:28:27] And when he went home, you know, tell me
[1:28:29] why he came back the same day saying he
[1:28:31] felt better. You know, I praised the
[1:28:32] Lord. I was like, Lord, I was like,
[1:28:33] Lord, you know, I was like, wow. You
[1:28:35] know, you know, I was like, you know,
[1:28:37] the the Lord's working. Amen. You know,
[1:28:39] uh uh he answered my prayer. Amen. I was
[1:28:41] like, wow. It it felt good. you know,
[1:28:44] you know, and I, you know, I just
[1:28:45] believe that's a relatable thing, you
[1:28:46] know. I'm just so good, you know. And
[1:28:48] then um there was another time you were
[1:28:50] talking, you know, and he was like, you
[1:28:51] know, I never seen you sad. You were
[1:28:52] just happy all the time, you know. You
[1:28:54] know, I said I said I said because the
[1:28:55] joy of the Lord is my strength. Amen. So
[1:28:57] that's why. Amen. You know, because
[1:28:59] because you know the, you know, when
[1:29:02] you're just taking the Lord by his oath.
[1:29:04] Amen. You know, I was listening to a
[1:29:06] brother one time. He said when you have
[1:29:08] when you um um when you have a
[1:29:10] relationship with God, you know, you get
[1:29:12] a greater revelation. And it's like a
[1:29:14] cycle. Amen. You know, when you have
[1:29:16] more revelation, you have a better
[1:29:17] relationship. And you get more
[1:29:18] revelation when your relationship gets
[1:29:20] better. So it continues to go on. Amen.
[1:29:23] So I'm always happy because that's what
[1:29:24] I'm getting every day. Amen. Amen. So So
[1:29:27] every day I'm seeing something new.
[1:29:29] Every time I walk outside, every time
[1:29:30] you got to see the Lord in everything,
[1:29:32] you know, you can't just, you know, the
[1:29:33] Lord is more than just the book, you
[1:29:35] know, because because this book right
[1:29:36] here, they can burn the Bible, but we
[1:29:38] know the maker. Amen. We know the
[1:29:40] author. Amen. Amen. So, like like Job,
[1:29:43] you know, uh Job, you know, uh he was
[1:29:45] the well, he was u the oldest story in
[1:29:48] the Bible. Amen. So, you know, that
[1:29:51] means he probably didn't have the Bible
[1:29:53] to read. So, how did he have such a
[1:29:56] revelation with God? Amen.
[1:29:58] how he didn't have a Bible to read.
[1:30:00] Amen. He knew the maker. Amen. And
[1:30:02] through knowing the maker, he even spoke
[1:30:04] to him. Amen. Through prayer. Amen. So,
[1:30:06] so we can be as as well versed as he
[1:30:09] want in the scriptures. Amen. But that's
[1:30:12] not what makes him answer you. Amen.
[1:30:13] That like like yes, that is part of it,
[1:30:15] but that's not the essence of why he's
[1:30:17] he's answering your prayers. Amen. He's
[1:30:19] answering your prayers because he hears
[1:30:20] himself speaking to him. Amen. Because
[1:30:22] because you know you you can never
[1:30:24] ignore yourself because when you you
[1:30:26] know um people you know people uh well
[1:30:28] my first question when I came into the
[1:30:29] message was what did God mean when he
[1:30:31] said let us? Amen. Because I thought it
[1:30:33] was just him. You know my first question
[1:30:35] ever when I came into the message. Amen.
[1:30:37] Because you know God speaks to us. We're
[1:30:40] reflections of him. Amen. So you speak
[1:30:42] to yourself don't you? Like you speak to
[1:30:44] the deity within yourself. Amen. So so
[1:30:48] when that just was a revelation unto me.
[1:30:50] Amen. Amen. Um, that was
[1:30:53] free. Amen. Um, so
[1:30:58] I want to uh continue. I want to read uh
[1:31:01] go back to our reading of Hebrews 6.
[1:31:08] Glory to God.
[1:31:16] And get there, say amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:31:19] Amen. So let's read uh verse 14. Now he
[1:31:23] says saying surely blessing I will bless
[1:31:27] thee and multiplying I'll multiply thee.
[1:31:29] Amen. So what is this saying? Amen. So
[1:31:32] I'm going to bless us and multiply.
[1:31:34] Amen. So I get my blessing and I get
[1:31:38] multiplication on top of that blessing.
[1:31:40] So it's not just one blessing. It's not
[1:31:42] just he he he promised to multiply on
[1:31:45] the blessing. Amen. So, so whatever you
[1:31:48] get, you have to be a good steward of
[1:31:50] what you get because because if you if
[1:31:53] you show them that you can cuz what what
[1:31:55] was that that that story that the Lord
[1:31:57] gave of the man who made cheese of um of
[1:31:59] how you know um uh with he he was good
[1:32:02] with a little bit and the Lord continued
[1:32:04] to give give to him and the more he gave
[1:32:06] unto him the more he gave. So he was
[1:32:08] making about what six million cheese a
[1:32:10] day. Amen. But he was a wealthy man
[1:32:13] because the Lord the Lord blessed him
[1:32:14] and multiplied him. Amen. Because he was
[1:32:17] a good steward over what the Lord gave
[1:32:18] him. Amen. So, so don't expect a
[1:32:20] blessing if you're not taking care of
[1:32:22] what the Lord gives you. Amen. Not take
[1:32:24] care of it. Amen.
[1:32:26] Amen. Um so so um he says surely
[1:32:31] blessing I will bless thee, multiplying
[1:32:32] I multiply thee. Amen. And um and we
[1:32:35] know that the Lord had had Abraham look
[1:32:37] to the to the stars and you know uh
[1:32:39] that's that so that so would be your
[1:32:42] seed and Amen. and everything will be
[1:32:44] blessed. The earth will be blessed
[1:32:45] because of your seed. Amen. So this
[1:32:47] earth is blessed and is being multiplied
[1:32:49] because of us. Amen. Because we're the
[1:32:51] seed of Abraham. Amen. And you know how
[1:32:53] they say the scripture says not not uh
[1:32:55] not all Jew is Jew in the flesh. Amen.
[1:32:57] The true Jew is a Jew in the spirit.
[1:32:59] Amen. See cuz we we are the true seed of
[1:33:01] Abraham. Amen. And the and when we go
[1:33:04] our work place is blessed because of us.
[1:33:06] Amen. Our our schools are blessed
[1:33:08] because of us. Amen. Everything is
[1:33:10] blessed because we're in their presence.
[1:33:12] If you ever notice, if you ever leave a
[1:33:14] place or leave a job, amen, that uh and
[1:33:16] they end up, you know, not doing so well
[1:33:18] after you leave. Amen. Why is that?
[1:33:19] Because you were there. Amen. Amen. Um
[1:33:22] um so uh to continue uh continue uh Lord
[1:33:25] says he swore by himself in 1954. He
[1:33:28] says um and so after that he had give
[1:33:32] Abraham his promise and promised he
[1:33:34] would bless and multiply him and
[1:33:35] withever whatever he would have done.
[1:33:38] Now look, God also after this took an
[1:33:40] oath to it, swore that he would do it.
[1:33:42] Amen. And and I'm I'm jumping ahead, but
[1:33:45] the Lord really wants me really wants me
[1:33:46] to say this. I'm jumping ahead. But in
[1:33:49] um verse 18, um it says that by two
[1:33:53] immutable things in which it was
[1:33:55] impossible for God to lie, that we might
[1:33:58] have a strong consolation who have fled
[1:34:01] for refuge to lay upon the hope set
[1:34:03] before us. Amen. And if you're reading,
[1:34:06] remember the Lord just told us Sunday
[1:34:07] that there's no such thing as a
[1:34:08] contradiction. Amen. If you're reading
[1:34:10] this, the carnal mind is saying,
[1:34:12] "Where's the second thing at?" Cuz you
[1:34:14] read it, it looks like it's saying one
[1:34:15] thing. It says, "By two mutable things."
[1:34:17] So, I'm looking for two things. Amen. It
[1:34:19] says, "In which it was impossible for
[1:34:21] God to lie and then it just goes on.
[1:34:24] Where's the second thing at?" Amen. And
[1:34:26] we need a prophet for that. Amen. So,
[1:34:28] what does brother Brandham say about
[1:34:30] this? Amen. Amen. Amen. So,
[1:34:34] Well, I'm jumping ahead, so I got to
[1:34:36] find it in my notes. Give me a second.
[1:34:38] Give me a second. Um, glory to God. Yes,
[1:34:42] my brother.
[1:34:44] Amen. So, cuz he says two things. Amen.
[1:34:47] He doesn't say one thing. So, that means
[1:34:49] it has to be in there. Amen. And it's,
[1:34:52] remember, Brother Brim had that vision
[1:34:53] of the mountain cut in the white and the
[1:34:55] white. Amen. The white is what's in
[1:34:57] between the lines. Amen. So what did the
[1:34:59] Lord show his prophet when his prophet
[1:35:01] went high went high into the heavenly
[1:35:03] heavenlies? What did he show him? What
[1:35:04] the scriptur is really saying? Amen. So
[1:35:07] in 1954 he's for by himself. Amen. Uh he
[1:35:10] says it's two of them. First it's
[1:35:13] impossible for God to lie. Then he says
[1:35:16] now the next thing is that God himself
[1:35:19] that can't lie. Amen. To make it perfect
[1:35:21] double. He swore by it that he will
[1:35:23] confirm the oath. Amen. Amen. And I just
[1:35:26] say amen to that. Amen. Amen. I may not
[1:35:28] understand it fully now, but that's what
[1:35:29] he said. Amen. So, I take out take him
[1:35:32] at his word. Amen. And that's what you
[1:35:34] do because if you do that later on, he's
[1:35:36] going to reveal unto you the full
[1:35:37] revelation of it. Amen. He's cuz you get
[1:35:40] the revelation from the prophet, but
[1:35:41] then there's a revelation there's a
[1:35:43] there's a supernatural revelation
[1:35:45] despite the first revelation that you
[1:35:47] get. Amen. There there's more in it.
[1:35:50] Amen. Because because you know uh uh uh
[1:35:53] uh I had uh my brother sent me a message
[1:35:56] you know of how um brother Brandon was
[1:35:58] saying how one scripture you can read it
[1:36:00] you know and you can take a million
[1:36:02] service services out of one scripture.
[1:36:04] Amen. Because it's eternal. Amen. It's
[1:36:06] it's it's more than just face value.
[1:36:08] It's more than just the first revelation
[1:36:09] you get. It's more than that. Amen. uh
[1:36:12] uh many preachers can take one scripture
[1:36:14] and preach five different sermons in
[1:36:16] different different areas of the life
[1:36:17] and all and they're all still we can
[1:36:18] find it in within other places in the
[1:36:20] scripture. Amen. Amen. And so um so
[1:36:24] there there's two things you know that
[1:36:25] um that uh he cannot lie. Amen. That he
[1:36:28] swore by himself that he can't lie. So
[1:36:30] and isn't that a wonderful thing because
[1:36:32] his word is immutable and if it's
[1:36:34] immutable that means it doesn't change.
[1:36:35] So so in essence he didn't have to make
[1:36:38] an oath because it's not going to
[1:36:39] change. He's eternal anyway. Amen. But
[1:36:42] he gave you a double blessing on top of
[1:36:44] that. He gave you a double assurance.
[1:36:46] Amen. What did he give the give to Job?
[1:36:49] He blessed Job doubly. Amen. Because
[1:36:52] because he he made his word immutable.
[1:36:55] So it's already eternal. Meaning he
[1:36:56] knows the end from the beginning. Amen.
[1:36:59] And then he made an oath on top of that.
[1:37:01] Amen. So it's like it's like there's
[1:37:03] layers to it. It's it's it's a combo.
[1:37:05] Amen. It's it's more through it. Amen.
[1:37:08] Amen. Amen. And and so um and then uh to
[1:37:13] continue um within the same verse uh he
[1:37:17] says he says we might have a strong
[1:37:20] consolation. Amen. Who who have fled for
[1:37:23] refuge to lay hold upon the hope set
[1:37:25] before us. Amen. So what hit me when I
[1:37:27] read this is you know um there are
[1:37:29] cities of refuge. Amen. And there's and
[1:37:32] if you realize it's for those who sinned
[1:37:35] in ignorance. Amen. And remember, we
[1:37:37] went over that a couple services ago.
[1:37:40] Amen. Those cities of refuge are for
[1:37:42] those who sin in ignorance. Amen. And
[1:37:44] and there are six of them. Amen. And
[1:37:46] what does six mean? Six represents man.
[1:37:48] Amen. And if and if if if you notice uh
[1:37:51] uh I have it in here somewhere. Um but
[1:37:53] I'm going just say it. Amen. Uh brother
[1:37:56] Benham, he says that you know whenever a
[1:37:58] man makes a covenant with God, he always
[1:38:00] breaks it. So it's up to God to keep the
[1:38:02] covenant. Amen. Because remember there
[1:38:03] was an instance that brother Brandham
[1:38:05] said that you know my religion uh I
[1:38:07] didn't keep my my religion my religion
[1:38:09] kept me. Amen. Amen. So you know the god
[1:38:11] keeps us. Amen. And and and you know
[1:38:14] when you go to those cities of refuge
[1:38:16] you know that's him keeping us. Amen.
[1:38:18] And the only way that you can the slayer
[1:38:22] can get to you is if you leave the city
[1:38:24] of refuge. Amen. And there's two ways
[1:38:27] there's two ways that the slayer can get
[1:38:29] to you in a city of refuge. Amen. The
[1:38:31] first way is if you leave the city.
[1:38:33] Amen. And and and we know that, you
[1:38:35] know, the scriptures say that um he who
[1:38:37] we once say has the Holy Ghost. Amen.
[1:38:39] You know, he's sealed in. He can't leave
[1:38:40] even if he wanted to. Amen. So by that
[1:38:42] we're all in anyway. We can't leave
[1:38:44] after that anyway. And then even if you
[1:38:46] try to leave, you have to pull to pull
[1:38:47] you back in. Amen. So So before you get
[1:38:49] to the door, the Lord's going to pull
[1:38:50] you back. Amen. Amen. So before you open
[1:38:52] the door to Satan, you're going to be
[1:38:53] pulled back. Amen. And and then and then
[1:38:56] um there's another way is if that high
[1:38:58] priest dies. Amen. And we have an
[1:39:00] eternal high priest. Amen. So so so
[1:39:02] Satan can never get to us. Amen. Amen.
[1:39:06] And um and and so so and those city of
[1:39:11] refugees that hit me real hard. I said,
[1:39:12] "Wow." I said, "So so the Lord can't
[1:39:15] lie." And he put an oath that he can't
[1:39:17] lie. And within within the same
[1:39:19] scripture, he says, "This is why we have
[1:39:21] a strong consolation." Amen. You have a
[1:39:23] strong consolation because the one who
[1:39:24] was greater than you who made the oath.
[1:39:26] Amen. He made an oath on top of the word
[1:39:28] that doesn't change anyway. Amen. Amen.
[1:39:31] So it's it's it's like it's beautiful.
[1:39:33] Amen. And then and then um um if you go
[1:39:36] jump back jump back to um uh 17 where he
[1:39:41] says you know wherein God this is
[1:39:44] Hebrews 6:1 17 he says wherein God
[1:39:48] willing more abundantly to show unto the
[1:39:51] heirs of promise. Amen. So this is not
[1:39:54] to anybody. Amen. So, so God, he's
[1:39:58] willing. Amen. He He has a bubbling in
[1:40:00] his heart. Amen. He He wants to express
[1:40:03] himself to his children. Amen. Like,
[1:40:05] like he's a God who upgradeth not. Amen.
[1:40:07] He gives liberally. Amen. Amen. Um, let
[1:40:10] let me get this. Let me get the note I
[1:40:11] have on this. Amen. Amen. He says he
[1:40:15] says uh he's a uh he beware God willing
[1:40:19] more abundantly. Amen. So, let's go to
[1:40:22] um verse uh 17.
[1:40:25] Yes sir.
[1:40:27] So it says
[1:40:29] so what is mutability? Immutability is
[1:40:32] the divine attribute of
[1:40:33] unchangeableness. Amen. This attribute
[1:40:35] is essential to deity. Amen. So it is
[1:40:38] essential. Amen. We are deity also.
[1:40:40] Amen. So we are we are immutable as
[1:40:42] well. Amen. Because and because what
[1:40:45] what what happened um last service when
[1:40:47] the Lord showed us uh uh Peter Amen. And
[1:40:51] morale he dropped but his faith stayed
[1:40:52] the same. Our faith is immutable. Amen.
[1:40:55] Amen. Because it's not our faith to
[1:40:58] begin with. It's God's faith. Amen. So,
[1:41:00] and we're sealed in by his faith. So, if
[1:41:02] he's immutable, our faith is immutable.
[1:41:04] So, our faith will never change. Amen.
[1:41:06] Amen. If anything, you're just going to
[1:41:08] grow more and more every day. If
[1:41:09] anything, that's the only way it can
[1:41:10] change. Amen. Because uh uh uh in in
[1:41:13] science class, amen, with we learned
[1:41:15] with energy. Amen. Uh you can't you
[1:41:17] can't take away energy. Amen. Energy
[1:41:19] cannot be taken away. But for some
[1:41:21] reason, energy can be added on to. Amen.
[1:41:24] So, you can always add on to energy, but
[1:41:26] you can't take away energy. Amen. And
[1:41:28] and and I I have a quote, but I I don't
[1:41:30] have it here, but I have a quote, but
[1:41:32] brother Brandham said that, you know, uh
[1:41:34] God is energy. Amen. Amen. And so um so
[1:41:38] so so in in in
[1:41:41] um in
[1:41:43] [Applause]
[1:41:45] um in in Hebrews chapter 6 and 7 in 1957
[1:41:51] uh uh the prophet says he says now we've
[1:41:54] already found that God became flesh.
[1:41:56] Amen. Uh dwelt among us. Amen. And how
[1:41:59] that he manifested himself towards the
[1:42:01] world. When he found the woman in
[1:42:03] adultery, talking about the woman at the
[1:42:04] well, he said, "I don't condemn you. Go
[1:42:07] sin no more." When he found the sick, he
[1:42:10] acted just the way he would have uh he
[1:42:12] would have to act for he was God. He had
[1:42:15] he and he had healed the sick. He raised
[1:42:17] the dead. He forgave the sins. A and I
[1:42:20] want to add this also. Um the Lord hit
[1:42:22] me with another another revelation when
[1:42:23] I was reading this. Amen. Um, you know
[1:42:25] how we we um we went over a while back
[1:42:28] that you know uh that the compassion of
[1:42:30] the Lord is not the compassion of man.
[1:42:32] Amen. And something that hit me when I
[1:42:34] look at that word compassion. Amen. It's
[1:42:36] that if you look in the word, it's the
[1:42:38] compass. Amen. So the compass of the
[1:42:41] Lord is what drives him to do the things
[1:42:43] that he does. Amen. So if we have the
[1:42:46] compass of the Lord, Amen. Um we may for
[1:42:49] no some reason not know why we do
[1:42:50] certain things, but we're just do to us.
[1:42:52] We're doing it just to do it. Amen. But
[1:42:54] it's the Lord working in us. Amen. It's
[1:42:57] him pushing working through us. Amen. To
[1:42:59] do us to do a certain thing. Amen. So,
[1:43:02] uh we will continue. And he says uh he
[1:43:04] raised the dead. He forgave the sins no
[1:43:07] matter how they was and how many how
[1:43:09] backsliden. Amen. Amen. He he forgave
[1:43:12] them anyhow they were willing to come
[1:43:13] and ask. Amen. See See, he forgives you
[1:43:16] if you were willing to come and ask.
[1:43:18] Amen. Because look, you may sin, you may
[1:43:21] fall, you're going to fall. Amen. Even
[1:43:23] brother Brandham says, "When you have
[1:43:24] the Holy Ghost, you're going to sin
[1:43:25] willingly." Amen. So, you're not you're
[1:43:28] not um higher than more holy than the
[1:43:30] person sitting next to you. Amen. Never
[1:43:32] feel that way. Amen. Amen. Because
[1:43:34] because uh you're you're a human, too,
[1:43:36] who is saved. Amen. You're you were you
[1:43:38] were bought into this world, you know,
[1:43:39] uh uh uh uh in sin, you know, speaking
[1:43:41] lies. Amen. Uh you're not perfect within
[1:43:43] yourself. You're perfect in Christ
[1:43:44] Jesus. That's how you're perfect. Amen.
[1:43:46] Amen. And um see so so when you see cuz
[1:43:49] the Lord says when you come into prayer
[1:43:51] he doesn't hear the prayer of a sinner.
[1:43:53] Amen. So that's probably when we pray we
[1:43:55] ask for forgiveness. Amen. That's why we
[1:43:57] ask Lord forgive me if I've done
[1:43:58] anything to being a reproach against
[1:43:59] this word or reproach against you. Amen.
[1:44:02] Forgive me Lord. You know my heart. I
[1:44:03] didn't mean that. Amen. Amen. And what
[1:44:05] happens? Amen. He he he he applies the
[1:44:08] bleach to it and it's gone. Amen. Amen.
[1:44:10] And um we'll continue. He says, "Now
[1:44:13] notice, if God acted any one time on a
[1:44:16] certain circumstance, if that same
[1:44:18] circumstance rise again, he's got to act
[1:44:21] the second time like he did the first
[1:44:23] time or he's unjust." Amen. Amen. So
[1:44:26] that's why we have such a strong
[1:44:27] consolation. Amen. Because when we look
[1:44:29] in the word and we see that he did
[1:44:30] something, amen, we see that he asked,
[1:44:33] he has to act the same. Amen. The second
[1:44:35] time, amen. And um that's why you have
[1:44:38] to grab him by his word. Amen. And
[1:44:40] brother Brennham continues and uh and he
[1:44:43] says, "I'm so glad of that, aren't you?
[1:44:45] That our God is willing." Amen. See,
[1:44:47] it's a different thing. Amen. If God
[1:44:49] says, "This is my word." Amen. But it's
[1:44:51] different if he expresses in his word
[1:44:53] that he's willing to manifest his word.
[1:44:55] Amen. Because because if you ever have
[1:44:57] someone, you know, uh um and if you have
[1:44:59] a boss at work, Amen. You know, it's in
[1:45:02] the fine print. It's his job to be
[1:45:04] willing to help you along. Amen. But you
[1:45:06] have some bosses that they just, you
[1:45:07] know, um it's your job. you should know
[1:45:09] what to do. You know, you stay over
[1:45:10] there. I stay over here. Amen. And he's
[1:45:12] your boss. Amen. So, he pays you. He
[1:45:14] gives you money. Amen. But, you know,
[1:45:17] he's not he doesn't express his
[1:45:19] willingness. Amen. Of your benefit.
[1:45:20] Amen. That's why some of the best jobs
[1:45:23] you can have, Amen. that are jobs that
[1:45:25] have a good uh what they call uh um um
[1:45:28] workplace uh atmosphere or envir
[1:45:32] environment. Amen. Uh that's why certain
[1:45:34] jobs are preferred over others even if
[1:45:36] the pay is a little less because because
[1:45:39] he treats you right. Amen. Because
[1:45:41] because he takes care of you. Amen. You
[1:45:43] have a full benefits package. Amen.
[1:45:45] Amen. See, uh all of your worries are
[1:45:48] covered. Amen. If you need dental,
[1:45:49] whatever it is, it's covered. Amen.
[1:45:51] Amen. And um and so I'll continue. Uh he
[1:45:54] says that our God is willing. Look, if
[1:45:56] he what if he wasn't longsuffering?
[1:45:59] Amen. He's asking questions. What is the
[1:46:01] fruit of the spirit? Love, joy, faith,
[1:46:04] peace, longsuffering. That's a part of
[1:46:07] God that's in you. Amen. It says he says
[1:46:10] and kin forbearance forbearing one
[1:46:12] another's burdens. Amen. So we forbear
[1:46:14] each other's burdens. Amen. We look we
[1:46:16] look beyond each other's faults. Amen.
[1:46:18] And we lift each other up because we're
[1:46:20] helpers of one another. Amen. Amen. And
[1:46:22] he says he says and then he's a good
[1:46:26] God. Amen. Cuz who's good? Only only God
[1:46:28] is good. Amen. If you want certain
[1:46:30] things your way, you know God's good
[1:46:32] enough to do that. Amen. We know he's
[1:46:34] good for it. Amen. So we have a we have
[1:46:36] a checkbook that always cashes through.
[1:46:38] Amen. Amen. He says if you want certain
[1:46:40] things your way, you know God's good
[1:46:42] enough to do that. He loves to just make
[1:46:44] you happy. Amen. Because what husband
[1:46:47] doesn't like to make his wife happy?
[1:46:48] Amen. Is we're his bride. Amen.
[1:46:51] Everything he does is for the bride.
[1:46:53] Amen. See, because what does what does
[1:46:55] Ephesians 5 say? Amen. It says he uh uh
[1:46:58] uh uh uh uh love your wife as Christ
[1:47:00] loved the church. Amen. Even giving
[1:47:01] himself for it. Amen. Amen. See, so what
[1:47:04] did he do on Calvary? He gave himself
[1:47:05] for his bride. Amen. Because he loved
[1:47:08] him so much that there's no oath higher
[1:47:10] than him. He couldn't show how much he
[1:47:12] loved us more than just his blood. Amen.
[1:47:14] That's how that's the greatest form of
[1:47:16] love he could show as God. Amen. Was was
[1:47:19] dying. Amen. Was taking our our sins,
[1:47:22] our imperfections on himself. Amen.
[1:47:24] That's how he expressed his love unto
[1:47:26] us. Amen. Because brother because the
[1:47:28] prophet told us that if he comes now
[1:47:29] today, he can't do nothing more than he
[1:47:31] can't. I'm sorry. He can't do nothing
[1:47:33] more than what he did on Calvary. Amen.
[1:47:36] Because that was the that was the
[1:47:38] epitome of love right there. Amen. Amen.
[1:47:42] So he says he wants to he he's love. He
[1:47:46] is love. Amen. And his great love
[1:47:48] constrains him. Amen. To even step down
[1:47:52] sometimes to let you have the things
[1:47:54] that you want. Amen. And and that's
[1:47:57] that's the permissive will. Amen. Even
[1:47:59] even when you're asking, you keep
[1:48:01] asking, you keep nagging him, you keep
[1:48:03] asking him. He's like, the unjust judge.
[1:48:06] Amen. He said, man, you know, I love him
[1:48:08] so much, you know. You know, I just got
[1:48:10] just give it to him. Amen. And and and I
[1:48:13] I He'll take it upon himself. I'll work
[1:48:15] it out. Amen. Amen. He says that he's
[1:48:19] going to work it out. Amen. Amen. So So
[1:48:21] that's why we trust in him. Amen. So
[1:48:24] even when you know he we're in his
[1:48:26] permissive will. Amen. that um um uh at
[1:48:29] the end of the day, he knew it was going
[1:48:30] to happen anyway because he has a plan.
[1:48:33] Amen. Amen. Because because
[1:48:35] because you know God doesn't do anything
[1:48:38] just to do it. Amen. He's he's going to
[1:48:40] show you something through that. Amen.
[1:48:42] He's going to show you. Amen. I gave it
[1:48:44] to you, but I wasn't supposed to give it
[1:48:46] to you. But so I'm going to show you
[1:48:48] what happened. You know what could have
[1:48:50] happened. You know, if if you just if
[1:48:51] you just held on a little longer. Amen.
[1:48:53] You probably saw the blessing could have
[1:48:55] been a little bit better. Amen. So if
[1:48:57] you just hold on the blessing can be a
[1:48:59] little bit better. Amen. Amen. Amen. So
[1:49:02] he says he says
[1:49:04] he says he says that he wants to he's
[1:49:08] he's love and his great love constrains
[1:49:11] him to even step down sometimes to let
[1:49:14] you have the things that you want. Amen.
[1:49:16] He says look at Thomas after the
[1:49:18] resurrection. Thomas wouldn't believe.
[1:49:21] Amen. He says, "I would I will have to
[1:49:23] put my hands uh I will have to put my
[1:49:26] hands in his side and my fingers over
[1:49:28] here in his hands before I believe it."
[1:49:30] Amen. He was a little stubborn. Amen.
[1:49:32] But he says, "I believe." He said he
[1:49:34] said, "I will believe it. I don't care
[1:49:36] what you say." Amen. So he was stuck in
[1:49:38] his own ways. Amen. He said, "This is
[1:49:40] the way I want it and I'm not and I'm
[1:49:42] not moving to this is how I get it."
[1:49:43] Amen. And and even though it may be
[1:49:46] wrong, he'll still give it to you
[1:49:47] sometimes. Amen. Amen. He said this says
[1:49:50] it says it says I don't care what you
[1:49:53] say. See he was all and and the only and
[1:49:56] because he does that is because you're
[1:49:58] his bride. Amen. Because because because
[1:50:00] what did uh uh Neb King Nebuchadnezzar
[1:50:04] or he
[1:50:07] haz when when we trying to go above the
[1:50:10] law he he he moves the scepter. He puts
[1:50:14] the scepter over. The scepter is above
[1:50:16] the law. Amen. The scepter is our grace.
[1:50:18] Amen. Amen. He says he he he he he open
[1:50:21] he opens a sliver of grace for you
[1:50:23] sometimes. Amen. Amen. And it says he
[1:50:26] says he says he says he says but Thomas
[1:50:30] said no. I'm sorry. Go back. He says he
[1:50:33] says uh he was all out of scripture
[1:50:35] order right then. Amen. He was all out
[1:50:38] of cater. Amen. He says you're supposed
[1:50:39] to believe it. Amen. The Lord the word
[1:50:41] says it. So he said I have to have some
[1:50:44] sort of evidence to prove it. And Jesus
[1:50:47] appeared. He's good. Brother Brennham
[1:50:49] says, "Come on, Thomas. If that's what
[1:50:51] you want, well, here you are. You can
[1:50:53] have it." Amen. Amen. And then, and then
[1:50:57] uh in the uh uh in Isaiah 40:1, it says,
[1:51:01] "He shall feed his flock like a
[1:51:02] shepherd." Amen. He shall gather the
[1:51:05] lambs with his arm. Amen. And carry them
[1:51:08] in his bosom and shall gently lead those
[1:51:10] that are young. Amen. In Psalms 136:12,
[1:51:15] it reads, "With a strong hand, with a
[1:51:17] stretched out arm, for his mercy
[1:51:19] endureth forever." Amen. And then I
[1:51:22] paused for a second. I said, "Well, what
[1:51:24] is mercy?" Amen. Amen. Because we say
[1:51:26] mercy a lot. Amen. But do you have
[1:51:28] concrete knowledge of what mercy is?
[1:51:31] Amen. See, so I did, you know, I read,
[1:51:35] you know, other books that give you
[1:51:36] translation of words. Amen. And it says,
[1:51:38] "Mercy is a Christian grace." Amen. So
[1:51:42] it's a it's a specific grace just for
[1:51:45] the Christian. Amen. And and uh brother
[1:51:48] Bham says in the prophet Elisha in 1954
[1:51:51] he says that's why his mercy is ling. So
[1:51:54] he's given the definition of mercy. He
[1:51:55] says that's why his mercy is lingering
[1:51:57] on longsuffering. Amen. Because there's
[1:52:00] some righteous people that are praying
[1:52:02] and are trying. Amen. So the righteous
[1:52:05] people that are praying that are trying
[1:52:07] they get extended his longsuffering.
[1:52:10] That's his mercy. Amen. And then in the
[1:52:13] Queen of the South, 1958, the Lord says
[1:52:15] of brother Brandon, which is the Lord,
[1:52:17] he learns, he says, Lord, give us mercy
[1:52:20] while mercy is still flowing free. And
[1:52:23] and this is another thing. See, this is
[1:52:25] another this is, you know, how some
[1:52:26] words have multiple definitions. This is
[1:52:28] another definition of mercy. It says,
[1:52:30] "And forgive us of our unbelief." Amen.
[1:52:33] So So mercy also looks beyond your
[1:52:36] unbelief. Amen. So when you're praying,
[1:52:39] when you're going through something and
[1:52:40] you have a little unbelief there that it
[1:52:43] just it's kind of nagging in there and
[1:52:44] you know, Lord, I should believe, but
[1:52:46] there is so there's something that it's
[1:52:48] just hard for me to see past it. Amen.
[1:52:50] But the mercy looks beyond that
[1:52:51] unbelief. Amen. Amen. in
[1:52:55] in in revel revelation chapter 4 number
[1:53:00] three uh 1961 the Lord says uh through
[1:53:03] brother Brandham and the reason today
[1:53:05] there is mercy is because the mercy seat
[1:53:08] is sprinkled within atonement
[1:53:11] amen as long as blood is on the judgment
[1:53:14] seat it's not judgment no more amen see
[1:53:17] it doesn't judge us because
[1:53:20] uh it it was just playing on the on the
[1:53:23] on the um what you call it on the
[1:53:25] speaker. Amen. Um um brother Brandon was
[1:53:27] saying the Lord showed him the Lord
[1:53:29] showed him uh um how how the um the
[1:53:33] Sorry, slow down. Um the woman when he
[1:53:36] was kind of he was judging the woman.
[1:53:38] Amen. And and the woman, you know, she
[1:53:40] uh uh uh she was, you know, in her sin.
[1:53:43] Amen. She was ignorant. Amen. And he
[1:53:44] said, "Just burn whole place up right
[1:53:46] now." Amen. He had a righteous
[1:53:47] indignation. Amen. So the Lord had to
[1:53:49] slow him down. He said, "Whoa, slow
[1:53:51] down." Amen. He slowed him down and he
[1:53:53] pulled him aside and he said and he was
[1:53:56] showing him that you ain't no different.
[1:53:57] Amen. See see never get a a hardy head
[1:54:02] just anybody. Amen. See cuz you're no
[1:54:04] different. Amen. Amen. See he showed him
[1:54:07] how how because brother Brandon said
[1:54:08] even the the believer has to ask for
[1:54:11] forgiveness every day. Amen. See see
[1:54:14] you're not without sin. Amen. Never
[1:54:16] never ever think you're not. Amen.
[1:54:18] That's why if if you weren't without sin
[1:54:21] Amen. then there was no there's no
[1:54:23] authority in in the cross. Amen. That uh
[1:54:26] there's no uh oomph there's no purpose
[1:54:28] to to the cross. Amen. Because it's by
[1:54:32] his authority. Amen. It's by him that
[1:54:34] we're made righteous. Amen. Amen. So so
[1:54:37] so brother the Lord showing brother
[1:54:39] Brandham of how you know um of how of
[1:54:42] I'm sorry of of how his sins Amen. of
[1:54:45] how because there's still mercy on the
[1:54:48] cross. Amen. that it was going to Jesus
[1:54:50] Christ. Amen. It wasn't going to him.
[1:54:52] Every time he sinned, that that was a
[1:54:54] lash to Jesus. Amen. And it hurt his
[1:54:56] heart. Amen. Because because no believer
[1:55:00] wants to see their savior hurt. Amen.
[1:55:02] Because because he already died for us.
[1:55:04] Why? We want to take on that burden. We
[1:55:06] want to bear that cross now because of
[1:55:07] what he did for us. Amen. We because
[1:55:10] what can we give him except a righteous
[1:55:12] except living the best that we can. What
[1:55:14] more can he He's given us everything.
[1:55:16] Amen. That's why worry not. Amen.
[1:55:18] Because our steps are ordered by the
[1:55:20] Lord. Amen. Everything that you need of
[1:55:22] is already provided for you. Amen. So,
[1:55:24] so stop worrying. Amen. That worry
[1:55:26] demon, bind it in the name of Jesus
[1:55:28] Christ and get moving. Amen. It has it
[1:55:30] has no right. Amen. It has no right to
[1:55:33] to be, you know, um it has no right to
[1:55:36] bother you. Amen. Shoot the crows. Amen.
[1:55:38] Don't let it murder your faith. Amen.
[1:55:40] Amen.
[1:55:42] Um um um and and then in second Peter
[1:55:46] 3:9 it says the Lord is not slack
[1:55:49] concerning his promise. Amen. So so
[1:55:52] concerning his oath. Amen. The Lord is
[1:55:55] not slack. Amen. See it also and see the
[1:55:58] see that is also revelation the Lord
[1:56:00] gave me. You know the Lord the Jesus
[1:56:02] Christ in his word the Bible uses the
[1:56:05] word God the word Lord and for certain
[1:56:08] reasons. Amen. See the the scripture is
[1:56:10] very specific. Amen. See everybody wants
[1:56:14] God to be their God but not their Lord.
[1:56:16] Amen. What does Lord mean? Amen. Lord
[1:56:19] means he is in every avenue of your
[1:56:22] life. Amen. He is everywhere. Amen. So
[1:56:25] he is not slack concerning his promises
[1:56:27] everywhere in your life. Amen. May it be
[1:56:29] your health, may it be your
[1:56:30] intelligence, may it be whatever it is,
[1:56:33] every moment in your life, every aspect,
[1:56:35] he's not slack. Amen. That's why That's
[1:56:37] why it said it's his time. Amen. In his
[1:56:41] time, he'll manifest it. Amen. And then
[1:56:44] it continues. And it says, "As some men
[1:56:46] count slackness." Amen. So to us, it's
[1:56:49] slack at certain times. Amen. But it's
[1:56:52] not. Amen. It's his time. Amen. See, and
[1:56:54] it continues. It's a semicolon. It's a
[1:56:56] continuation. It says, "But is
[1:56:59] longsuffering to usward." Amen. So, he's
[1:57:02] not slack concerning his promise,
[1:57:04] extending his grace towards us in times
[1:57:06] when we need when we need that extra
[1:57:08] grace, when we're struggling in in a in
[1:57:09] a in a in a uh in a trial period, you
[1:57:12] know, when we're waiting, you know, he
[1:57:14] extends his grace towards us. Amen.
[1:57:15] Because he knows that we're trying to
[1:57:17] hold on, but this flesh gets in the way
[1:57:19] all the time. We're trying our best to
[1:57:20] hold on, but you know, the flesh is
[1:57:22] stepped in sometimes, and sometimes, you

[2:23:21] Brandon compared heaven like pig slap.
[2:23:24] Um, he compared the earth to heaven like
[2:23:27] pig slap. He was like, you know, you may

[2:23:52] like when we get to heaven, you know,
[2:23:54] that's why we forget all these all the
[2:23:56] trials, all the all all things. We only

[2:24:35] trivial things of life get under my
[2:24:36] skin. You the worry for nothing. Amen.
[2:24:40] Amen. See? And um in in the in the

[2:26:00] so. I believe it. That's it. You know,
[2:26:03] he said, "Make an art." Make an arc.
[2:26:04] What for? It ain't for me to know. Amen.
[2:26:07] He says he says now we all know that
[2:26:10] that the antidolivian world would not
[2:26:12] see he goes into it. I'll skip that. He
[2:26:13] goes into it. He says he says
[2:26:16] um he says now the scientific thinkers
[2:26:19] of that day his message was contrary. No
[2:26:22] doubt us that smart scientist could have
[2:26:24] come to him and said now look here Mr.
[2:26:27] Noah. Now we got instruments that we can
[2:26:29] shoot we can shoot the moon and we can
[2:26:32] do all these scientific researches.

[2:26:59] conventional lives. Amen. See, our life
[2:27:02] is not conventional. Amen. It's not it's
[2:27:05] it's it's full of you know um maybe to

[2:27:09] than our ways. His thoughts are higher
[2:27:11] than our thoughts and then see so don't
[2:27:13] even try to figure it out trying to
[2:27:14] figure it out. So you go out the deep
[2:27:16] end and then then you start trying to
[2:27:18] read these read books and things and you

[2:27:36] said that it would rain and that shadows
[2:27:38] it." God said so. See, and look how long
[2:27:41] this took. 120 years was persistent in
[2:27:45] the face of the scientific world of his
[2:27:47] day. Amen. We have a scientific world
[2:27:50] right now. The Lord said in the days of
[2:27:52] Noah, Amen. We are living in the days of
[2:27:54] Noah right now. Amen. In the scientific
[2:27:57] world of this day, Amen. We have to we

[2:28:39] like, man, that went beyond my thinking.
[2:28:41] How'd it even come that way? Amen.
[2:28:44] See? Amen. And then, and then he says,
[2:28:46] he says, "Still claiming his message was
[2:28:49] right because it came from God. I don't
[2:28:51] care what it is. As long as it comes
[2:28:53] from God, I'mma believe it." Amen. It
[2:28:56] says, "As long as it come from this pull
[2:28:57] pit, as long as I hear it in the in the
[2:28:59] tape," Amen. I'm hold on to it, I'm

[2:29:18] act of faith. Amen. He wasn't lazy about
[2:29:20] it. Amen. See, so you know, yes, faith
[2:29:23] is unconscious. Yes. you don't um um get
[2:29:26] rattled by things. Amen. And so there's
[2:29:28] a balance. You got to find the balance.

[2:30:52] y'all probably saying right now is,
[2:30:53] "Give Caesar what's to Caesars." Amen.
[2:30:56] Well, that doesn't apply when God, uh,
[2:30:58] that doesn't apply to God's bride when

[2:33:15] closing, as I'm closing, the musicians
[2:33:18] can come up. Um, the Lord continues. He
[2:33:22] says, he says, um,
[2:33:26] he says, "No matter what the rest of the
[2:33:27] world said, no heard from God." That's
[2:33:30] all that mattered to him. He heard the
[2:33:32] voice. He was sure it was God. and he
[2:33:34] was making ready that it seemed very
[2:33:36] silly to the world but yet Noah knew God
[2:33:39] would keep his word because it's an
[2:33:41] immutable oath. Amen. Amen. Um uh the
[2:33:45] musicians may come up. I'm closing.
[2:33:48] Amen. I'mma read another quote just to
[2:33:50] close it out. Um I'm read this quote
[2:33:52] right here. I really like this quote.
[2:33:55] This quote touched my heart in a great
[2:33:56] way in restoration of the bride bride
[2:33:59] tree in 1962.
[2:34:03] So if you didn't get anything else, just
[2:34:05] get this right here. The Lord says
[2:34:07] through brother Bren through his prophet
[2:34:08] which is his mouthpiece. He says because
[2:34:11] why? He has spoke a word and put a law
[2:34:15] with that word. Amen. By these two
[2:34:17] immutable things. Remember that
[2:34:18] scripture. Put a law with that word. And
[2:34:21] the law is his own law. His own life
[2:34:26] behind it. He's putting himself on the
[2:34:28] line for you. Amen. Amen. He says that's
[2:34:32] the reason he swore by himself. Amen.
[2:34:35] There's none greater. See, he had take
[2:34:38] an oath cuz no covenant should be
[2:34:41] confirmed without an oath. And the only
[2:34:44] way he could do before he did take it by
[2:34:47] himself and himself became the oath.
[2:34:51] Amen. Oh brother. Oh brother. When God
[2:34:55] became man and he was the oath, made
[2:34:59] himself the oath. Amen. Then um and that
[2:35:04] that's all. Amen. That's all that's what
[2:35:06] the Lord put on my heart. Amen. Uh there
[2:35:09] was more, but I believe I believe that's
[2:35:11] what the Lord wanted y'all to get.
[2:35:19] Amen. May the Lord add the increase to
[2:35:21] as well. May May may may the Lord add
[2:35:24] after add to his word. Amen. Then um if
[2:35:26] we stand we um pray bust the church in
[2:35:29] prayer. Yes sir.
[2:35:36] [Music]
[2:35:41] Glory. Bow our
[2:35:43] hearts. Father God we come unto you Lord
[2:35:46] God. Humble you Lord God Jesus
[2:35:48] Christ. Father God we come to you in the
[2:35:51] name of Jesus Christ. Father God, we

[2:35:54] God. For you are the oath, Lord Jesus
[2:35:56] Christ. Lord God, we thank you, Father
[2:35:58] God, for such a consolation in your
[2:36:00] word, Lord God. Such a promise, Lord
[2:36:02] God. Such a covenant, Father God, that
[2:36:04] we can take you by your word, Lord God.
[2:36:06] Whatever may come, Father God, you said
[2:36:08] it and then we believe it, Lord God.
[2:36:09] Father God, whatever, Lord God, it is
[2:36:11] even if we don't understand it, Father
[2:36:13] God, when it comes, Lord God, we say
[2:36:14] amen and we keep moving, Father God,
[2:36:16] because by and by, we'll understand it
[2:36:18] more by and by, Father God. Father God,
[2:36:21] we I pray, Lord God, blessings over this
[2:36:23] congregation, Lord God. Father God, my
[2:36:25] brothers and sisters in Christ, Father
[2:36:26] God, my precious brothers and sisters in
[2:36:28] Christ, Lord God. Lord God, I pray
[2:36:30] blessings over them, Father God. For you
[2:36:32] say, Father God, to give them their
[2:36:33] flowers now, Lord God, not Father God,
[2:36:35] after they've already passed, Lord God.
[2:36:37] Father God, I'm thankful, Lord God, for
[2:36:40] such a pastor, Lord God, after your own
[2:36:41] heart, Lord God. I'm thankful, Father
[2:36:43] God, for this message, Lord God. Lord
[2:36:45] God, Jesus Christ, we want to ask for
[2:36:46] this message, Lord Jesus Christ. Lord
[2:36:48] God, we came in this world speaking
[2:36:49] lies. Father, we came we came in this
[2:36:51] world, Father God, not even we came in
[2:36:53] this world as pagans, Lord God. And
[2:36:54] Father God, you took it upon yourself,
[2:36:56] Lord God, to show us, Lord God, by your
[2:36:58] grace, by your love, Father God, this
[2:37:00] word, Lord God, this message, Lord God,
[2:37:02] you touched our heart, Father God. Lord
[2:37:04] God, you gave us a heart of flesh,
[2:37:06] Father God, a new heart, Lord God. And
[2:37:08] Lord God, you went upon that cross, Lord
[2:37:10] God, and you spilled the blood, Lord
[2:37:12] God. You said like, "Father God, this
[2:37:14] person, Father God, these people, Lord
[2:37:16] God, my bride, they're worth it, Lord
[2:37:18] God. Jesus Christ." And Father God, if
[2:37:19] you can just get that revelation, Lord
[2:37:21] God, just grab on to that revelation,
[2:37:23] Father God, you said we're worth it,
[2:37:25] Lord Jesus Christ. Father God, the God
[2:37:27] of heaven and earth, Father God, the
[2:37:28] God, Lord God, who's who's eternal,
[2:37:30] Father God, who time is nothing to him,
[2:37:32] Father God, he came down and experienced
[2:37:34] time, Lord God, just, Father God, to
[2:37:37] just to save us, Lord God. Father God,
[2:37:40] time is nothing to him, Lord God. He
[2:37:41] subjected himself to a life of
[2:37:43] struggling, Lord God. Father God, he
[2:37:45] subjected himself, Father God, to a life
[2:37:47] of suffering, Lord God. He subjected
[2:37:49] himself to it when he was above it, Lord
[2:37:51] God. He didn't have to do that. You
[2:37:52] didn't have to do that, Jesus Christ.
[2:37:54] You didn't have to do it, Lord. But you
[2:37:55] chose to do it, Lord God. Father God,
[2:37:57] just so we can live, Lord God, glorious
[2:38:00] lives just so we can live blessed lives,
[2:38:02] Father God. Father God, you took it upon
[2:38:04] yourself, Lord God, to become the oath,
[2:38:06] Lord God. And we thank you for it, Lord
[2:38:08] Jesus Christ. Lord God, I pray
[2:38:09] blessings, Father God, over my brothers
[2:38:11] and sisters, Lord God. I pray, Lord God,
[2:38:13] blessings over their health, their
[2:38:14] wealth, Father God, over all things,

[2:38:31] keep whipping them, Lord God. We're
[2:38:32] going to keep strongly. He's fighting a
[2:38:33] losing battle, Lord God. Every time he
[2:38:35] raised his head, Lord God, we're going
[2:38:36] to say boo. Lord God, boo back at him,
[2:38:38] Father God. He's nothing. He's nothing
[2:38:39] but a bluff, Lord God. Jesus Christ. He
[2:38:41] has no B. He has no arrow in his bow,
[2:38:43] Father God. He's weak, Lord God. All he
[2:38:45] can do, Lord God, is attack us, Lord
[2:38:47] God, with mind battles, Lord God. And
