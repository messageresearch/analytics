[28:34] love them and we're going to pray for
[28:35] them amen I don't have anything else
[28:37] let's let's go ahead uh let's go ahead
[28:40] and have sister uh Rosemary come up and
[28:42] give her testimony and then we'll pray
[28:44] is that okay
[28:45] amen
[28:47] amen
[28:49] let me get you a microphone sister
[28:58] God bless you precious Saints
[29:01] a few years ago I had given a testimony
[29:05] to the glory of the Lord that he had
[29:07] healed me of lactose intolerance
[29:11] it used to be so bad that before they
[29:14] discovered it was they wanted to do
[29:16] surgery and I I refused
[29:20] and so holding on to the word of the
[29:23] Lord one day I mean it used to be that
[29:27] when I started eating I start coughing
[29:29] really really bad like I was choking
[29:32] and
[29:34] and it would just be like that it didn't
[29:36] matter what I ate
[29:37] then later on I was told that it was
[29:40] lactose so but despite all that I was
[29:43] still on allergy medications but they
[29:46] added another one
[29:47] and and so the Lord took away that
[29:51] lactose issue and I was able to continue
[29:54] to drink milk and eat milk products and
[29:58] continued on the medication for the
[30:00] allergy
[30:02] so
[30:05] I'll give glory to the Lord today
[30:07] because
[30:09] he reminded me that
[30:13] you got the inspiration and told your
[30:16] husband to stop jadians right in this
[30:19] the middle of the service and he did
[30:22] and the Lord honored it and and
[30:26] um
[30:27] took care of his blood sugar but you
[30:29] continue to take these medications
[30:33] and just so you know the
[30:36] allergies were so bad to a point that if
[30:40] I I was taking medication once a day
[30:43] and when the 24 hour reaches before I
[30:48] take the medicine I start sneezing I
[30:51] start coughing and
[30:52] start drooling it was that bad and
[30:55] sometimes during even the seasons I
[30:58] could even go up and take two or three
[31:01] medications with
[31:02] a spray and my eyes also so that's how
[31:06] bad it was
[31:07] and despite these even with the
[31:10] medications that I would still that
[31:12] trigger would still come and I would
[31:13] start sneezing and and coughing
[31:17] anyway so when that inspiration came I
[31:20] said
[31:21] and all the preaching and God you are in
[31:24] me and you're part of me I'm part of you
[31:27] and you say that nothing is impossible
[31:30] with you
[31:31] and that if you're in me I can do all
[31:34] things
[31:35] and you know the the preaching just kept
[31:37] on and I said you know what I'm stopping
[31:39] these medications for me native fact
[31:42] and I did that was two weeks ago
[31:46] and
[31:47] the fight continued and every time the
[31:50] symptoms come said you're a liar yeah
[31:53] I'm not listening to you
[31:55] you have to go you have to leave because
[31:57] you will not make my God be a liar there
[32:01] is nothing that is impossible with him
[32:03] and I continued and I am standing here I
[32:07] have not taken a single medication
[32:09] for two weeks
[32:11] and I'm glorifying God
[32:18] and I just want to encourage you who
[32:20] might be going through the same
[32:22] if you take that Leap of Faith remember
[32:25] the enemy will start keep trying to come
[32:28] back but you just have to keep talking
[32:30] to him and rebuking him and I give all
[32:33] glory to an honor to God
[32:38] amen
[32:40] amen
[32:42] Hallelujah

[53:17] once again my apology I send you a
[53:20] scripture late last night so whoever
[53:22] could like I say if possible so don't be
[53:25] under condemnation if you saw the
[53:27] message in the morning and you are
[53:28] unable to read it but if you were still
[53:31] up
[53:32] and you had an opportunity to read it
[53:35] then that's between you and God Amen but
[53:38] I felt like I cannot read the whole
[53:40] chapter I will try the best that I can
[53:42] but if you get the background story it's
[53:44] going to be easy to move together amen
[53:47] glory to God I believe everybody is up
[53:50] to date with the sermon I believe
[53:52] everybody is reading the Bible in the
[53:54] morning one chapter and before you go to
[53:56] bed one chapter that's what the prophet
[53:58] said I believe everyone is reading the
[54:01] Cod book at least one question a day we
[54:04] have the church ages we got the seals
[54:06] and we got the 70 weeks of Daniel it's
[54:08] my responsibility to remind you so that
[54:11] you constantly stay in the word amen
[54:14] even if you don't have a chance while
[54:16] you're driving put that tape on listen
[54:19] to the prophet God will give you an
[54:21] inspiration right there and he can
[54:23] change the course of your life so in
[54:25] other words let's stay constantly into
[54:27] the word amen but Abel I'm still waiting
[54:30] for the Young's men meetings sister
[54:32] Divine I'm waiting for the young Sisters
[54:34] Meeting and Lord's willing on September
[54:37] the 16th which I believe it's next
[54:39] Saturday that's our question and answer
[54:41] the remaining of the uh the instruction
[54:44] will be sent in the WhatsApp chat and if
[54:47] you have any question please do so by
[54:50] Wednesday night so I have a little bit
[54:53] of time to kind of prepare for it amen I
[54:56] believe I got everything covered up
[54:57] let's go straight to our scripture
[55:02] amen
[55:04] body Kalima seems like he is not here so
[55:07] somebody need to compensate
[55:10] amen
[55:12] somebody need to say Amen
[55:15] and keep the fire moving
[55:18] we need one another I need each one of
[55:20] you
[55:21] I need the small amen the bigger man the
[55:24] medium email Amen all amen amen Oh Glory
[55:29] to God let's go to the Book of Judges
[55:33] amen
[55:38] glory to God
[55:43] who are the friend we have in Jesus
[55:49] amen you there
[55:51] let's see how far we can even go with
[55:54] this scripture
[55:57] amen
[56:01] looks like the more you read the
[56:02] scripture you open up more
[56:06] because the seals did something to the
[56:08] Bible he turned the Bible into a new
[56:11] book
[56:12] everybody there
[56:14] we are now Judges chapter 6 verse one if
[56:18] you're there you can say amen amen the
[56:21] Bible says and the children
[56:25] the Bible didn't say the people
[56:29] the Bible says the children
[56:32] the children of Israel
[56:35] not the people the children amen they're
[56:39] still the people of God but the Bible
[56:41] says the children
[56:43] the children of Israel did evil in the
[56:47] sight of the Lord
[56:48] and the Lord delivered them into the
[56:51] hand of the me of median how many years
[56:54] seven years
[56:56] so seven years the children were under
[56:58] trouble
[57:00] does it ring your bed
[57:04] seven years
[57:07] you should be jumping with these numbers
[57:11] in other words trouble started
[57:13] at E1 and it's gonna end in year
[57:18] so what do we expect at the seventh year
[57:24] what do we expect
[57:26] the mathematics of the scripture you
[57:29] might be seated
[57:31] amen
[57:33] he said and the Hand of median Prevail
[57:37] against Israel
[57:39] and because of the medianat the children
[57:42] of Israel made them the then
[57:46] made them the dance which are in the
[57:49] mountains and caves and stronghold so
[57:53] somebody now is under the enemy has
[57:56] taken the hand over amen
[57:58] and so verse 3 he was when Israel had
[58:02] sown that the millionaire came up
[58:05] and the amalekite
[58:08] you see a malachite
[58:10] and that's why God said wipe them up
[58:13] they came miss an opportunity over
[58:16] Israel whenever something goes about
[58:18] Israel malachite have to be there amen
[58:21] he said and the children of the East
[58:23] even they came up against them
[58:27] verse 4 and they encamp against them and
[58:30] did what destroyed destroy water the
[58:33] increase
[58:37] when Israel or sowing no problem they
[58:40] stay away when they increase come
[58:42] when that new paycheck comes
[58:45] [Music]
[58:48] you've never been there
[58:50] you've never been there
[58:52] every time when it's Thursday or when
[58:55] it's a Friday that's when sickness begin
[58:58] to come
[59:00] you've never been there oh okay maybe
[59:02] you've been fine and nothing have been
[59:04] happening to you all your paycheck has
[59:07] been 100 covered
[59:09] amen
[59:10] you know what happened right and
[59:12] sometime before even the paycheck comes
[59:14] I'm just picking paycheck as an example
[59:17] so it makes sense okay before it comes
[59:21] you know what happened right this one's
[59:23] sick and the hospital bill and this this
[59:25] and it looks like after all the money is
[59:28] gone everything goes back to quietness
[59:32] they don't want to see money in your
[59:34] bank account
[59:36] they want to eat and leave you with two
[59:38] dollars or overdraft
[59:43] it's a malachite
[59:48] it's not normal
[59:53] amen it's not normal don't think it's
[59:57] normal
[59:58] don't even get used to that
[1:00:02] like money comes and money goes that's
[1:00:05] not correct
[1:00:12] I'm bringing
[1:00:16] you that frees you not only spiritually
[1:00:18] but you have to free you physically
[1:00:21] financially material everywhere
[1:00:25] brother Brown and preach a message told
[1:00:27] Deliverance
[1:00:30] the Deliverance have to be told in other
[1:00:33] words in every aspect you must be free
[1:00:35] amen
[1:00:38] your children delivered everything that
[1:00:42] you do deliver
[1:00:43] amen
[1:00:47] the Bible says in verse 4 and they
[1:00:49] encamp against them and destroy the
[1:00:52] increase of the Earth
[1:00:54] until you come together and left no
[1:00:58] sustenance
[1:01:00] for Israel neither ship nor Ox nor water
[1:01:05] they only come to destroy
[1:01:07] amen
[1:01:09] not even to take it to just destroy
[1:01:12] verse 5 for they came up with their
[1:01:16] cattle and their tent and they came up
[1:01:19] as grasshopper for multitude the system
[1:01:21] you get that amen and he said that was
[1:01:25] her question for birthday and their
[1:01:27] camel where with that number and they
[1:01:30] enter into the land to destroy it
[1:01:34] and Israel was greatly rich
[1:01:38] impoverished
[1:01:42] Israel was greatly impoverished because
[1:01:46] of the median Act and the children of
[1:01:49] Israel did what Cried unto the Lord they
[1:01:52] Cried unto the Lord and he came to pass
[1:01:54] when the children of Israel cried they
[1:01:57] went
[1:02:00] they went because of the medianade that
[1:02:02] the Lord sent a prophet so at the end of
[1:02:06] seven years what comes a prophet
[1:02:11] [Applause]
[1:02:14] so if we have seven churches what do you
[1:02:16] expect at the end of the sentence a
[1:02:18] prophet
[1:02:19] that is the order of God
[1:02:22] is the program of God
[1:02:24] it is how God operated
[1:02:27] When the Children when his children are
[1:02:30] out of line to bring them back in line
[1:02:34] you need a prophet I love this church
[1:02:40] I love this church
[1:02:42] amen a prophet
[1:02:46] what is a prophet going to do at the end
[1:02:50] of the seven years
[1:02:53] amen
[1:02:55] amen
[1:02:57] don't worry brother kalim is here
[1:03:02] amen don't worry everything is okay amen
[1:03:07] the Bible says and that the Lord sent a
[1:03:10] prophet to the children of water Israel
[1:03:14] notice he's calling them the children
[1:03:16] everybody okay
[1:03:18] which say to them this is age of the
[1:03:20] prophet
[1:03:21] thus says the Lord God of Israel
[1:03:25] I brought you up from what Egypt
[1:03:29] the prophet when he comes
[1:03:32] he's taking the children
[1:03:37] [Music]
[1:03:39] everybody okay and bring them to the
[1:03:43] fifth
[1:03:48] that started from Egypt
[1:03:50] [Applause]
[1:03:52] he returned them to the origin amen he
[1:03:56] said remember you all came out of Egypt
[1:03:59] and the coming out of it and the coming
[1:04:02] out of Egypt started with a prophet
[1:04:07] and his name was Moses
[1:04:10] so the prophet at the end of the seventh
[1:04:13] year
[1:04:14] returned the children
[1:04:17] back to the fifth
[1:04:20] of the prophet of The Exodus amen
[1:04:24] and the prophet of The Exodus was Moses
[1:04:27] who brought the law
[1:04:29] amen so the beginning of Israel started
[1:04:33] with a prophet
[1:04:34] amen
[1:04:37] so the prophet is returning the children
[1:04:41] back to the faith of their fathers
[1:04:48] everybody okay the children's heart have
[1:04:51] been turned back to the faith of the
[1:04:53] water fathers the father had a prophet
[1:04:56] there and Paul was a prophet
[1:04:59] and Paul took the law of Moses and
[1:05:02] opened up the law of Moses so from
[1:05:05] Prophet to prophet
[1:05:08] so at the end of The Seven Year a
[1:05:10] prophet comes
[1:05:12] and the prophet is coming to restore the
[1:05:15] faith back to the faith of the father
[1:05:20] amen amen the Bible says and I brought
[1:05:23] you up from Egypt and brought you out of
[1:05:27] the house of water
[1:05:28] of the House of bondage everybody okay
[1:05:30] job two verse 11.
[1:05:34] for the sake of time
[1:05:36] after the prophet came
[1:05:38] after the prophet deliver his message
[1:05:40] who get on the scene
[1:05:43] amen
[1:05:45] verse 11 and there came water an angel
[1:05:51] why is it a combination of the prophet
[1:05:54] and the angel of the Lord
[1:05:57] okay
[1:05:58] amen that's why we have that picture
[1:06:01] over there
[1:06:04] the prophet and the angel of the Lord
[1:06:06] amen that's why we have that picture
[1:06:08] over there
[1:06:13] there is nothing out of the scripture in
[1:06:16] this message
[1:06:17] this message is perfectly in line with
[1:06:21] the Bible
[1:06:22] you have a prophet and you have the god
[1:06:25] of the prophet that Pillar of Fire is
[1:06:28] also called the angel of the Lord he is
[1:06:30] an angel of the Lord when he moved Faith
[1:06:33] or he take the form of an Angel that's
[1:06:36] why they call him the angel of the Lord
[1:06:38] when he take the form of a priest they
[1:06:41] call him water
[1:06:42] Melchizedek
[1:06:45] it's God in Murphy we okay verse 11 and
[1:06:49] there came an angel of the Lord and sat
[1:06:52] under the oak tree which was in offer
[1:06:56] that pertain to Jewish the abezzarite
[1:07:00] and his son who Gideon
[1:07:03] stressed with by the wine press to do
[1:07:07] what to hide it he already got into the
[1:07:09] system
[1:07:11] you have to have a pig or something to
[1:07:14] keep putting some senses there
[1:07:17] because if he put it in the bank account
[1:07:19] to pull it up
[1:07:21] you have to hide it
[1:07:24] okay it's a Battleground in the bank
[1:07:27] account
[1:07:29] that's where all the bills are coming
[1:07:34] and the angel of the Lord amen
[1:07:37] and the angel verse 12 and the angel of
[1:07:40] the Lord appeared to him did the angel
[1:07:43] of the Lord appear to anybody else no
[1:07:46] you appeared to who get in
[1:07:49] the angel of the Lord which is God
[1:07:52] himself
[1:07:53] amen
[1:07:56] he came to Gideon
[1:07:59] amen
[1:08:00] and he appeared to him
[1:08:06] amen amen the message that came from the
[1:08:09] angel was to all Israel
[1:08:12] but the coming of the angel
[1:08:15] is not going to all Israel the angel is
[1:08:18] individual
[1:08:21] we okay
[1:08:22] and the angel of the Lord appeared to
[1:08:25] him and said to him
[1:08:27] the Lord is with you all no thee
[1:08:34] the angel is talking to who Gideon the
[1:08:37] Lord is with who Gideon
[1:08:41] keep that in mind the Lord is with you
[1:08:46] you who Mighty Man of Valor
[1:08:51] number one
[1:08:52] the angel of the Lord say that God
[1:08:59] number two he says you are a Mighty Man
[1:09:04] of value
[1:09:07] amen
[1:09:09] remember there is to you
[1:09:12] you know that right there is you and
[1:09:15] there is also you
[1:09:17] who is the Angel talking
[1:09:19] [Music]
[1:09:22] you you you are who is the Angel
[1:09:26] referring to
[1:09:28] you and you because the other you was
[1:09:31] hiding the stuff
[1:09:34] yeah
[1:09:36] how can a mighty man of value hide stuff
[1:09:45] amen amen what I'm trying to say is when
[1:09:49] God talked to you
[1:09:51] he doesn't look at you
[1:09:57] I don't know if you get my term when God
[1:10:00] speak to you he doesn't look at you
[1:10:03] as much as we were nice clothing
[1:10:08] this morning and we all look nice
[1:10:10] handsome and pretty and beautiful God
[1:10:14] don't look at that
[1:10:17] when God is starting this morning he's
[1:10:20] not talking at you
[1:10:22] but God is still talking at you
[1:10:33] look how God look
[1:10:36] the Bible says in first Samuel chapter
[1:10:38] 16 verse 7 but the Lord say unto who
[1:10:42] Samuel he said look not in his what
[1:10:46] consonants or on the height of water his
[1:10:50] stature God doesn't even care about your
[1:10:52] height amen
[1:10:58] everybody okay he says because I refuse
[1:11:02] him for the Lord sees not as water man
[1:11:06] see when we talk to one another we look
[1:11:09] at ourselves when God is looking at you
[1:11:12] he's not really looking at you he's
[1:11:14] looking at you
[1:11:22] he said for man look at what on the
[1:11:25] outward appearance
[1:11:29] the heart
[1:11:31] is soul deceived
[1:11:33] it to you he's looking at you see
[1:11:40] in that word god acknowledge what looked
[1:11:44] like him
[1:11:46] [Applause]
[1:11:46] [Music]
[1:11:47] [Applause]
[1:11:51] so you need to be very careful when God
[1:11:53] is talking to you
[1:11:56] when God tell you I'm strong you will
[1:11:58] realize the time he tells you you
[1:12:01] stronger is the time you are really weak
[1:12:04] [Music]
[1:12:07] and it's usually a paradox you say I
[1:12:10] feel weak but God saying you are strong
[1:12:14] because God is seeing you
[1:12:18] [Applause]
[1:12:21] glory to God everybody okay
[1:12:25] listen to Gideon and give yourself God
[1:12:28] was talking to who Gideon he said the
[1:12:30] Lord is with who d
[1:12:32] Gideon look how Gideon responded verse
[1:12:36] 13 and Gideon said to him oh my Lord
[1:12:41] if the Lord be with water us did God
[1:12:45] tell him he was with them no Hallelujah
[1:12:50] [Music]
[1:12:53] when God is preaching this morning he's
[1:12:56] not preaching to everybody
[1:12:58] [Applause]
[1:13:04] leave your wife fell on
[1:13:06] leave your husband alone leave your
[1:13:09] brother and your sister alone God is

[1:31:05] me
[1:31:07] highly favored
[1:31:08] so the scripture of Isaiah that I was
[1:31:11] thinking

[1:32:45] like God made a mistake
[1:32:48] if he was a married woman who doesn't
[1:32:51] have a child she could have said praise
[1:32:53] the Lord thank you Jesus now I'm going

[1:35:13] impossible
[1:35:15] they were asking her The Impossible amen
[1:35:21] so she has to believe the impossible
[1:35:25] and God is giving her an example of the
[1:35:28] impossible
[1:35:30] you did you see that impossible it
[1:35:32] happened

[1:36:45] ah yeah yeah yeah yeah
[1:36:49] father help me up
[1:36:51] I'm gonna try the best that I can
[1:36:55] for those who read this chapter
[1:36:58] amen
[1:37:00] Paul was going toward Italy
[1:37:03] he was going to Rome
[1:37:05] amen we are dealing with Acts chapter
[1:37:08] 27.
[1:37:09] now let me pull this up so it makes
[1:37:12] sense in Acts chapter 23
[1:37:16] everybody good God spoke to Paul
[1:37:20] and say the night following the Lord
[1:37:24] stood by him and said
[1:37:26] be of good cheer Paul
[1:37:28] for us that has testified of me in what
[1:37:31] Jerusalem so much that bear witness also
[1:37:35] at what Rome
[1:37:38] so once when Paul was saying I appeal
[1:37:41] unto Caesar he already knew
[1:37:45] why did he only chose Caesar because in

[1:40:18] [Music]
[1:40:21] Paul was a prophet I already gave you a
[1:40:24] scripture for this
[1:40:26] for people who have trouble saying
[1:40:28] brother Branham say Paul was a prophet
[1:40:30] it's not written in the Bible I already
[1:40:32] gave you the scripture on that acts 13
[1:40:34] Verse 1 Paul a prophet everybody okay a
[1:40:38] prophet and the teacher
[1:40:41] the Bible says now was much was spent
[1:40:44] Paul admonished the verse 10 and said to
[1:40:46] them sir
[1:40:48] I perceive that this Voyage this trip
[1:40:52] will be with hurt
[1:40:55] and much water damage
[1:40:57] not only to the lady and sheep but also
[1:41:01] of water Our Lives according to the
[1:41:04] under the Holy Spirit brother was
[1:41:09] Paul said

[1:41:16] everybody okay
[1:41:18] not only the Sheep it will destroy the
[1:41:21] cargo
[1:41:22] whatever is in on the ship and he also
[1:41:25] will destroy the lives of the people
[1:41:28] including Paul
[1:41:32] didn't say he's going to destroy your
[1:41:34] life not my life
[1:41:36] everybody okay but God told Paul you're
[1:41:39] going to go to Rome
[1:41:42] now the holy spirit is decoding a
[1:41:46] message from hell where Satan is trying
[1:41:49] to destroy the ship destroyed the cargo
[1:41:52] and he also destroyed everybody
[1:41:55] including power
[1:41:57] because sometimes the devil will try to
[1:41:59] seek everybody because of you
[1:42:01] [Applause]
[1:42:05] many children were killed in Egypt
[1:42:08] because of Moses
[1:42:10] many children were killed in Israel
[1:42:12] because the devil was looking for Jesus
[1:42:14] Christ

[1:42:40] airplane
[1:42:41] [Applause]
[1:42:47] that's why when you're traveling you are

[1:43:30] there
[1:43:32] he believed the master of the honor of
[1:43:36] the ship
[1:43:38] brother say he taught that he knew more
[1:43:43] about the Sheep than the Holy Ghost
[1:43:46] that's what brother Bradham said
[1:43:48] the Bible says that the Centurion
[1:43:50] believed the master of the honor of the
[1:43:54] ship so Paul had the message
[1:43:56] and the master had the message
[1:44:00] we okay two messages this one his
[1:44:04] message is based on the expertise
[1:44:08] he's an expert he knows disease
[1:44:12] scientifically
[1:44:14] he's right
[1:44:17] [Applause]
[1:44:18] the scientific approach is against the
[1:44:22] prophet
[1:44:23] [Music]

[1:44:47] everybody okay verse 11 nevertheless
[1:44:49] this until you believe the master and
[1:44:52] the owner of the ship more than those
[1:44:55] which were spoken by who Paul so they
[1:44:58] didn't believe Paul and it's a dangerous
[1:45:01] thing not to believe a prophet
[1:45:06] can you say Amen because the Bible says
[1:45:10] in second Chronicles chapter 20 verse 20
[1:45:13] believe on the Lord your God and you

[2:02:12] uh Lord have mercy job to verse
[2:02:20] job to versa
[2:02:24] 33
[2:02:25] and while the day was coming on Paul
[2:02:29] besought them out to do what take meat
[2:02:33] when the message came to Paul
[2:02:36] Paul didn't only spoke the message but
[2:02:40] Paul began to behave
[2:02:46] according to his vision
[2:02:50] at the beginning nobody was eating
[2:02:53] including Paul because the Bible say it
[2:02:55] was a long abstinence right but since
[2:02:58] the angel unfolded the plan Paul changed
[2:03:01] his behavior
[2:03:02] he got over there he went to the
[2:03:04] microwave
[2:03:06] and the ship is going this way
[2:03:09] and he's pushing the microwave
[2:03:11] and the people are looking at him
[2:03:15] amen
[2:03:16] verse 33 and what the day was coming on
[2:03:20] probably sought them all to take me
[2:03:21] saying this is the 14th day two weeks
[2:03:30] a complete circle
[2:03:33] that you have carried and continue doing
[2:03:36] what fasting who put them on faster
[2:03:40] not listening to the prophet
[2:03:43] you will go to fasting to fasting trying
[2:03:46] to bring God outside of the prophet
[2:03:50] thing won't work
[2:03:53] having taken water nothing wherefore I
[2:03:56] pray you to take some meat for disease
[2:03:59] for your health
[2:04:00] for they shall not ahead
[2:04:04] fall from your head fall from the head
[2:04:07] of any of you and when he has just
[2:04:10] spoken he did what it took bread gave
[2:04:14] thanks to God this is
[2:04:23] can you behave like that

[2:04:31] demo and when he had broken it he began
[2:04:34] to do what eat then where
[2:04:38] they all of good cheer and they also
[2:04:42] took water some me so when the supper
[2:04:44] begin to eat
[2:04:46] they say you know what
[2:04:48] man I'm hungry too
[2:04:52] because Paul God spoke to Paul
[2:04:55] God didn't speak to all of it
[2:04:58] God spoke to Gideon God didn't speak to
[2:05:01] all of them when you begin to act
[2:05:04] according to your revelation
[2:05:07] [Applause]
[2:05:10] it's like a perfume it will begin to
[2:05:13] move on and he will begin to affect
[2:05:15] somebody else
[2:05:18] and before you know it everybody when
[2:05:21] David killed Goliath
[2:05:23] all Israel stood up
[2:05:27] nobody want to go home anymore without
[2:05:30] the blood on the shin
[2:05:33] if I go back my wife would ask me how
[2:05:35] many did you kill I must Chase these
[2:05:38] people
[2:05:39] because one person stood for something
[2:05:42] that everybody
[2:05:44] amen you stand for God Alone
[2:05:50] [Applause]
[2:05:53] because of your position
[2:05:55] [Applause]
[2:06:04] some children are struggling because the
[2:06:07] parent didn't take a decision
[2:06:11] it's the parent you would have condemned
[2:06:14] the thing the child would look at the
[2:06:16] parent and say I'm behind my father but
[2:06:18] the child is looking at Daddy and daddy
[2:06:21] is under hesitation
[2:06:23] we are the one confusing our children
[2:06:26] [Applause]

[2:06:31] stand for that message amen
[2:06:32] [Applause]
[2:06:37] if you don't stand for the message how
[2:06:40] are the children gonna stand for the
[2:06:41] message

[2:06:47] be friend to everybody not with the
[2:06:50] message you leave the message that
[2:06:52] leaves you amen

[2:06:59] family amen

[2:07:39] score is 20 times three it's 60 and 16
[2:07:42] 200 plus 60 plus 16 is 276.
[2:07:49] 276 people would like to die but because
[2:07:52] one person
[2:07:54] was in that ship
[2:07:57] and that person has a covenant with God
[2:08:00] [Applause]
[2:08:02] amen the life of those people were given
[2:08:05] to power
[2:08:09] in other words if any of them die Paul
[2:08:12] and God are in trouble
[2:08:14] [Music]
[2:08:19] everybody okay let me read this quote
[2:08:21] here brother Branham saying for death
[2:08:24] stood by me this not the angel of God
[2:08:26] whose servant I am and whom I served
[2:08:29] saying water fear not Paul that must be
[2:08:31] brought before who Caesar for God has
[2:08:34] given thee all them that sell with thee
[2:08:36] brother Branham say listen
[2:08:39] at what his faith in his vision he must
[2:08:43] have faith
[2:08:45] to his vision
[2:08:49] [Music]
[2:08:50] [Applause]
[2:08:52] so when that Vision come it is not
[2:08:55] enough
[2:08:56] you must believe that Vision amen
[2:09:05] to me according to your word you must
[2:09:15] my subject this morning
[2:09:19] is the four phases of roof faith in your
[2:09:23] water Revelation vision
[2:09:29] God will give you a revelation but you
[2:09:32] must believe it
[2:09:36] God will tell you who you are
[2:09:39] but you must believe
[2:09:41] your package
[2:09:44] [Music]
[2:09:48] everybody good so far everybody okay
[2:09:51] amen everybody okay father help me up
[2:09:54] what are we dealing with
[2:09:56] ah
[2:09:58] where am I at I'm good in time my friend
[2:10:01] we are good don't worry when I say good
[2:10:04] we really good
[2:10:06] amen
[2:10:07] we know clearly and we understand
[2:10:09] clearly now that God has a plan for us
[2:10:14] he has a project for us
[2:10:16] he had a purpose for us God have an
[2:10:19] agenda for us
[2:10:22] and that agenda was hidden in God
[2:10:25] and it's not a bad agenda it is a good
[2:10:29] agenda because Paul is saying that eyes
[2:10:32] have nothing
[2:10:33] no water you're heard neither water have
[2:10:37] entered into the heart of man it's not
[2:10:39] revealed yet the things which God has
[2:10:41] what prepared for them that love him so
[2:10:44] God has something that he has prepared
[2:10:46] for you
[2:10:47] and it's a good thing amen
[2:10:50] amen verse 10 but God has water revealed
[2:10:54] them to us by the water his spirit for
[2:10:56] the spirit to do whatever search is all
[2:10:59] things yeah the Water Deep things of God
[2:11:01] am I the word whatever God has for you
[2:11:04] is still blocked
[2:11:08] is still locked in God
[2:11:12] and for you to receive yes that
[2:11:15] information
[2:11:17] all that Vision or that Revelation or
[2:11:22] that instruction that you need to be
[2:11:24] delivered you need an agent
[2:11:27] that's gonna take that information from
[2:11:29] God and bring it to you
[2:11:33] everybody okay the agent that take the
[2:11:36] information from God unto you is the
[2:11:39] Holy Spirit
[2:11:41] that's why Paul is saying that those
[2:11:43] things are delivered or revealed to us
[2:11:46] by the what spirit because the spirit
[2:11:49] goes into God
[2:11:50] and goes into deep
[2:11:53] the Deep of God
[2:11:55] and go inside and say who is it it's
[2:11:58] brother so and so and the spirit pick up
[2:12:01] what he has there and he come up with it
[2:12:03] and he come and delivered to you are we
[2:12:06] clear so far Paul says that for what man
[2:12:10] knoweth the things of a man save the
[2:12:12] spirit of a man which is in him even so
[2:12:16] the things of God knoweth no man but the
[2:12:18] water spirit of God so to know things
[2:12:21] from God you must be connected to the
[2:12:22] Holy Ghost amen that's why the Holy
[2:12:24] Ghost come in your life to waking you up
[2:12:27] and to give you those things
[2:12:29] verse 12. now we have received not the
[2:12:32] spirit of the world but the spirit which
[2:12:34] is of what God that we may what know the
[2:12:39] things that are freely given to us of
[2:12:41] God the spirit
[2:12:50] we are freely
[2:12:52] given to us by who God in other words
[2:12:57] what God has for you is a gift amen
[2:13:04] because it's really in other words God
[2:13:07] has gifts
[2:13:12] your purpose is a gift
[2:13:16] it's a present
[2:13:20] amen
[2:13:21] because it's freely
[2:13:23] you don't pay for it
[2:13:25] they just go bring it and give it to you
[2:13:28] everybody okay
[2:13:29] so God what he has for you in store is a
[2:13:34] gift
[2:13:35] it's a present
[2:13:37] amen where are you trying to go the
[2:13:41] Bible says this in the book of
[2:13:43] Deuteronomy 29 29
[2:13:45] that the secret things
[2:13:50] belong to her the Lord our God
[2:13:56] you okay
[2:13:59] another word
[2:14:01] when something is in God
[2:14:06] it is not your responsibility
[2:14:12] what is a secret in God you are not
[2:14:16] accountable for it
[2:14:21] you are not liable to it
[2:14:25] God cannot condemn you if you don't know
[2:14:30] or if God have never told you what he
[2:14:34] has for you
[2:14:38] in other words when things are in God he
[2:14:42] put God in danger
[2:14:47] because if you die
[2:14:50] brother and you have not fulfilled that
[2:14:54] God is in trouble
[2:14:57] everybody good so it is God
[2:15:00] responsibility
[2:15:02] to find a way to remove the liability
[2:15:06] from him
[2:15:08] [Music]
[2:15:10] because if God judge you
[2:15:14] and he never told you
[2:15:17] God himself will be guilty
[2:15:20] God doesn't want to be guilty the Bible
[2:15:22] said nobody can win God in a court
[2:15:25] so God make an effort to deliver your
[2:15:29] package as soon as possible
[2:15:31] so that the liability is no longer on
[2:15:34] him
[2:15:35] the liability is on you
[2:15:39] everybody okay so when God
[2:15:42] uh uh Moses says here that the things
[2:15:46] which belong unto unto uh the secret
[2:15:49] things belong unto the Lord Our God but
[2:15:52] those things which are house revealed
[2:15:54] belong to who us and to our children how
[2:15:58] forever in other words when God brings
[2:16:01] something that belongs to you and
[2:16:04] delivered that to you
[2:16:07] that thing don't belong to God anymore
[2:16:16] he was for God when he was Secret
[2:16:21] when it's reveal it doesn't belong to
[2:16:24] God
[2:16:27] I'm reading the Bible
[2:16:29] in other words the transferring of gift
[2:16:32] of the transferring of a vision or the
[2:16:36] transferring of a revelation is a
[2:16:39] transferring of liability
[2:16:41] [Applause]
[2:16:43] it is a transferring of accountability
[2:16:48] it is a true fearing that God is pushing
[2:16:52] something to you now you are responsible
[2:16:56] to do what that thing says amen
[2:17:01] why brother Branham says this glory to
[2:17:04] God
[2:17:05] yey foreign for instance could not
[2:17:08] believe that God was Enderman
[2:17:12] that was the biggest obstacle that they
[2:17:15] have to do what climb over was how him
[2:17:19] being a man yet made himself how God
[2:17:22] they could not see how God could dwell
[2:17:25] in a human flesh
[2:17:27] in human flesh in all ages in all times
[2:17:32] God has always thought well in man
[2:17:37] is God's agent
[2:17:41] in every generation
[2:17:44] God speak to his people through water
[2:17:46] human lives he always chooses who
[2:17:49] someone or something that he can do what
[2:17:51] use 96 God uses man for his water agent
[2:17:56] is that right how always God uses a man
[2:18:00] to be who his agent continue my friend
[2:18:02] Jesus was God's agent and who Elijah was
[2:18:06] God's agent and who John was God's agent
[2:18:08] if this age God has a witness Lord let
[2:18:12] me be your wife agent
[2:18:16] [Applause]
[2:18:22] so when God brings something to you you
[2:18:26] are liable
[2:18:28] in other words God expects you now to be
[2:18:33] responsible for your gift
[2:18:35] [Music]
[2:18:37] let's go to Roman one
[2:18:39] as I'm climbing
[2:18:42] father help me
[2:18:44] glory to God
[2:18:46] Romans chapter one if you dare you can
[2:18:48] say Amen
[2:18:52] thank you Jesus
[2:18:54] faith in your revelation
[2:18:57] faith in your vision
[2:18:59] when your vision comes to you you must
[2:19:01] believe it
[2:19:04] amen you must be saying be unto me
[2:19:09] in either way that I believe what you
[2:19:10] say
[2:19:16] because when God is transferring
[2:19:19] whatever belongs to you he is also
[2:19:21] transferring himself
[2:19:25] remember you don't go yourself he goes
[2:19:27] with you I will be with you the Holy
[2:19:30] Ghost will come on you so when you are
[2:19:32] receiving what he says you are receiving
[2:19:35] him
[2:19:36] you are receiving his ability
[2:19:41] you are receiving cookies
[2:19:43] [Applause]
[2:19:47] because God of God watches over his word
[2:19:51] when God releases the word God is in
[2:19:55] that way
[2:19:55] [Applause]
[2:20:02] in other words if you ask God fulfill
[2:20:05] that he said no I already gave it to her
[2:20:10] if it's not done it's not me it's her
[2:20:13] it's him
[2:20:14] Romans chapter 1 verse 19 if you dare
[2:20:17] you can say amen amen because that which
[2:20:19] may be known
[2:20:21] of God is how manifest in them is that
[2:20:24] the word God made known to them for God
[2:20:27] has showed it to them for the invisible
[2:20:31] things of him from the creation of the
[2:20:33] world are clearly seen
[2:20:36] being understood by the things that are
[2:20:40] now made even his eternal power and
[2:20:43] godhead so that they are how without
[2:20:46] excuse in other words once God we feel
[2:20:48] it you are with that excuse
[2:20:55] before Mary was with excuse
[2:20:59] but when the angel came and spoke to
[2:21:02] Mary no more excuse for Mary
[2:21:06] everybody okay verse 21 because that
[2:21:10] when they knew God
[2:21:12] they glorified him not as what God
[2:21:15] neither were water thankful but became
[2:21:18] van in the water imagination and the
[2:21:21] Foolish Heart was water darkened so what
[2:21:23] God unfold himself to you God is
[2:21:27] accepting you to be thankful
[2:21:30] and he's expecting you to impress what
[2:21:33] he's saying and to act according to it
[2:21:38] are we together are we together let's go
[2:21:41] to act chapter 19 chapter 17. then we
[2:21:45] saw my friend
[2:21:49] amen amen amen Acts chapter 17.
[2:21:56] amen amen amen
[2:21:59] if you dare you can say Amen acts 17
[2:22:02] verse 29 the Bible says this
[2:22:06] that
[2:22:07] for in him in God we live and we do what
[2:22:12] we move verse 20
[2:22:15] 8 and we move
[2:22:18] and have our being as certain also as
[2:22:21] your own power to have said for we are
[2:22:24] also his offspring verse 29 my apology
[2:22:26] for as much then as we are The Offspring
[2:22:29] of God we ought not to think that the
[2:22:32] godhead is like to go all silver all
[2:22:36] Stone driven by art or men's devices
[2:22:40] and the time of this water ignorance
[2:22:45] God did what wink that
[2:22:47] but now
[2:22:50] commandeth oh man everywhere to do
[2:22:54] whatever repent in other words when you
[2:22:56] did not know
[2:22:59] God closed his eyes
[2:23:05] in other words when you were dancing in
[2:23:08] a nightclub God didn't want to see that
[2:23:13] because you were ignored
[2:23:15] everybody okay
[2:23:17] everybody okay God will another word
[2:23:20] that God Wicked that means god look over
[2:23:23] it because you didn't know any better
[2:23:25] but once God revealed to you
[2:23:29] that the eyes of God are open to you
[2:23:34] are we okay now that's why Paul said
[2:23:36] everything that I did before I did it in
[2:23:40] ignorance
[2:23:41] in other words God doesn't look at that
[2:23:45] [Applause]
[2:23:47] [Music]
[2:23:50] they knew that you talking about poor
[2:23:53] family
[2:23:54] then you that is the least of my father
[2:23:56] the you that was bad then you that
[2:24:00] killed somebody in Egypt God damn look
[2:24:03] at that amen
[2:24:08] when you did it God went
[2:24:13] because you didn't know you are not
[2:24:15] responsible for it but now once God
[2:24:18] revealed to you it belongs to you
[2:24:25] last one let's go to John 3.
[2:24:31] I hope somebody caught what I just say
[2:24:34] Amen
[2:24:36] the you that you looking at yourself
[2:24:39] that you built a complex with
[2:24:42] God ignored that one
[2:24:45] the complex man God ignore him God
[2:24:49] ignore her
[2:24:53] when you are doing all you think you are
[2:24:55] doing bad to that God doesn't look at
[2:24:57] that
[2:24:58] because you are ignorant
[2:25:01] when the Devil comes he said hey she
[2:25:03] didn't know what else do you want
[2:25:06] she didn't know how am I going to blame
[2:25:08] her for something she didn't know
[2:25:13] you therefore you knew what did you do
[2:25:15] about it
[2:25:17] this one didn't know
[2:25:20] amen
[2:25:21] amen amen
[2:25:24] Elizabeth was condemned
[2:25:28] or who satire was condemned because
[2:25:31] Zechariah had the example in the Bible
[2:25:35] that's why God said I'm going to shut
[2:25:36] your mouth
[2:25:37] so no negativity come out of your mouth
[2:25:39] anymore
[2:25:42] but because Mary did not know Norman not
[2:25:46] scripture in the Bible's ever this thing
[2:25:48] happened God winted that
[2:25:51] he said I all have some explanation
[2:25:56] so when you were ignorant God waited
[2:25:59] that
[2:26:00] so when God is coming to talk to you
[2:26:03] stop bringing out your past
[2:26:05] [Applause]
[2:26:09] when God bring you the vision of your
[2:26:11] life stop bringing that old man
[2:26:15] stop revolving those bad souvenirs
[2:26:18] because those souvenir God Wicked that
[2:26:22] [Applause]
[2:26:24] because you are ignorant you didn't know
[2:26:27] what you were doing
[2:26:33] even if you were born in the message
[2:26:37] you were not born again yet you didn't
[2:26:39] know what you were doing
[2:26:44] because Paul was religious
[2:26:46] and he called himself a chief sinner
[2:26:50] so you can be born in a message you
[2:26:52] didn't drink any Bee by your Chief
[2:26:54] sinner
[2:26:56] because you did it ignorantly you didn't
[2:26:59] have the Revelation yet and God went to
[2:27:03] that
[2:27:05] can I continue amen John 3 verse 27 the
[2:27:09] Bible says that John answer and say what
[2:27:12] a man can receive water nothing
[2:27:17] except he be given him from water heaven
[2:27:21] so there is nothing that you can receive
[2:27:24] if it doesn't come from heaven
[2:27:26] nothing
[2:27:28] nothing and I say nothing amen so going
[2:27:32] back to the board
[2:27:34] Moses said the secret things belong unto
[2:27:37] the Lord our God
[2:27:39] in other words when it's healed it is
[2:27:41] not our responsibility
[2:27:43] he will stays with God but those things
[2:27:46] which are revealed belong to who us once
[2:27:51] God unfolds something to you
[2:27:54] God have changed ownership amen
[2:27:58] [Applause]
[2:28:00] everybody okay amen and it's not to you
[2:28:03] but it's also to your Waters children
[2:28:06] when division was given to power he also
[2:28:09] saved everybody that was in the book
[2:28:11] amen
[2:28:13] [Music]
[2:28:16] that's why God rebuked Moses
[2:28:21] because when Moses met God God
[2:28:25] demonstrated to him who he was
[2:28:27] God God Moses the plan of his life God
[2:28:31] told him the purpose of Moses and every
[2:28:34] time trouble come Moses had a tendency
[2:28:36] to go back to God
[2:28:38] until God looked he said hey
[2:28:41] why are you crying to me
[2:28:44] you are the one responsible I thought
[2:28:47] you I made you God
[2:28:49] [Applause]

[2:29:01] take a break you take the godship and
[2:29:05] handle Egypt right one
[2:29:08] now
[2:29:10] God to me again
[2:29:12] to talk to me and say God help me
[2:29:14] he said Moses when you were going to
[2:29:16] Egypt I told you something I say that I
[2:29:19] make you God
[2:29:20] you when you meet Pharaoh you are
[2:29:23] Jehovah

[2:29:34] prophet
[2:29:35] so when you meet Pharaoh it is Jehovah
[2:29:38] talking to pharaoh
[2:29:40] God have had a business to mind
[2:29:42] [Music]
[2:29:43] I already just for the responsibility to
[2:29:47] you I'm expecting you to believe what I
[2:29:51] told you
[2:29:52] and to act according to what I told you

[2:30:00] you must have faith in your Resurrection

[2:30:07] and you must act according to it amen
[2:30:12] everybody okay
[2:30:14] everybody good so when they leave God it
[2:30:17] belongs to me
[2:30:20] it is no longer the responsibility of
[2:30:22] God
[2:30:23] Moses how do you go I will go with you

[2:30:35] happened over there what do you have in
[2:30:37] your hand take it do it this way
[2:30:42] brother Branham said that was the name
[2:30:44] of Jesus Christ

[2:31:48] promise is unto us you and to your
[2:31:51] children the promise of the Holy Ghost
[2:31:55] that we may want to do all the words of
[2:31:57] the so the purpose that God is revealing

[2:32:46] to act according to the vision amen
[2:32:49] [Music]
[2:32:52] [Applause]
[2:32:53] why because Paul believed his vision he
[2:32:58] believed his Revelation it's gonna be to
[2:33:01] me as the angel of the Lord have said
[2:33:04] that angel never lie to me if he spoke
[2:33:07] that's it he told me I will

[2:33:16] everybody okay everybody good glory to
[2:33:20] God listen to uh habakkuk the Bible said

[2:33:27] say write the Water Division and make it
[2:33:30] plan upon water tables that he may run
[2:33:33] that the water read it so the one who's
[2:33:35] going to read the vision must have
[2:33:36] division
[2:33:38] for the vision is yet for water in a
[2:33:41] point in time but at the end it shall
[2:33:43] what speak and not water lie don't eat
[2:33:47] Terry
[2:33:48] do water wait for it
[2:33:54] when it's already revealed to you even
[2:33:57] if you tell me wait for it
[2:34:02] be patient
[2:34:03] safe and precious Gods together
[2:34:09] division cannot lie
[2:34:11] God cannot lie it is impossible for God
[2:34:15] to lie
[2:34:16] [Applause]
[2:34:18] cannot continue
[2:34:21] he says don't eat Terry do what wait for
[2:34:24] it because it will surely come it will
[2:34:28] not what Terry
[2:34:31] foreign
[2:34:42] the Bible said don't eat Terry and the
[2:34:46] Bible said he will not tell so they
[2:34:48] reached two times there
[2:34:50] there is your time and God's time
[2:34:53] [Applause]
[2:34:54] [Music]
[2:34:57] [Applause]
[2:34:59] in your time he might be telling because
[2:35:03] you want it to happen now but it's not
[2:35:06] God's time yet in God's time it will
[2:35:09] happen according to that time
[2:35:11] [Applause]
[2:35:18] did I miss you no
[2:35:20] no in other words if God say

[2:35:27] tomorrow today is September 10th right
[2:35:30] okay let me change the date so somebody
[2:35:32] can take it today
[2:35:35] if God says September 10th
[2:35:38] this one will not tell
[2:35:42] but if God told you on September 7
[2:35:46] you probably am thinking maybe September
[2:35:49] 8th is gonna happen God said don't eat
[2:35:51] Terry
[2:35:52] you wait
[2:35:54] but it will not hear it in other words
[2:35:56] when the rich the date
[2:35:59] that God predestinated it will happen
[2:36:02] exactly on the Block in the minute in
[2:36:07] the second
[2:36:09] exactly how God said
[2:36:11] [Applause]
[2:36:16] the word if according to your time it is
[2:36:20] taking time be patient but just know God
[2:36:24] will keep his word amen whatever God
[2:36:26] said will happen amen no matter what
[2:36:30] [Music]
[2:36:34] that's why you must trust your vision
[2:36:37] amen
[2:36:39] you must stress your revelation
[2:36:42] you must trust what God told you it will
[2:36:46] always happen
[2:36:51] in your vision
[2:36:53] have fat in your Revelation have faith
[2:36:57] in the word of God he will never lie
[2:37:00] Heaven and Earth might pass away but his
[2:37:04] word will always
[2:37:05] [Applause]
[2:37:09] why God says so
[2:37:12] God says so
[2:37:15] and abaka said wait
[2:37:19] for because it will surely come it will
[2:37:22] not water
[2:37:25] behold
[2:37:26] his soul which is lift up is not upright
[2:37:29] in him but what just shall live by his
[2:37:33] faith they just shall live by what hey
[2:37:40] who they were talking about vision now
[2:37:42] they're talking about faith in the Old
[2:37:44] Testament
[2:37:45] they were talking about Vision now they
[2:37:48] said they just shall live by revelation
[2:37:54] I walk by faith and not by sight sight
[2:38:00] my Terry by faithful don't Terry amen
[2:38:06] everybody okay so far everybody good so
[2:38:09] far therefore brother Branham says this
[2:38:13] that we met a member of the Virgin Brad
[2:38:16] will do what love him and they will have
[2:38:19] his water potentials
[2:38:26] when God is coming to talk to Gideon
[2:38:29] because he didn't get potential
[2:38:35] he was a married man of fellow
[2:38:38] he said we will have his potential in
[2:38:42] other words the potential of God are in
[2:38:44] you
[2:38:45] that's why God can transfer his plan to
[2:38:49] you amen because you can act like him
[2:38:52] [Applause]
[2:38:54] [Music]
[2:38:56] in other words you are his caliber
[2:38:59] [Music]
[2:39:00] [Applause]
[2:39:02] God don't handle his business to nobody
[2:39:06] when he gives it to you he already
[2:39:08] contacted you to worry
[2:39:10] [Applause]
[2:39:14] he says for he is the water their head
[2:39:18] and all powers belongs to him they are
[2:39:21] subject to him as the member of her body
[2:39:24] are subject to our heads notice the
[2:39:28] harmony of the father and the who son
[2:39:33] Jesus never did anything until he was
[2:39:39] first shown
[2:39:40] him by the what Father John 5 19. in
[2:39:45] other words Jesus when he acted he
[2:39:48] always acted after Revelation or a
[2:39:51] vision
[2:39:53] that's why he always succeeded
[2:39:56] can I continue amen there had this
[2:39:59] harmony is now to exist between hope to
[2:40:03] grow and what his bride Jesus time is
[2:40:05] finished
[2:40:07] he shows her his water Word of Life God
[2:40:11] revealed to you
[2:40:13] God unfold his word
[2:40:15] she does What receives it like Mary she
[2:40:19] never doubtsy you must receive or have
[2:40:22] faith
[2:40:24] therefore nothing can do whatever harm
[2:40:27] her in other words will receive your
[2:40:29] vision what you accepted What God Says
[2:40:33] help push the brick
[2:40:37] thank you
[2:40:39] nothing can harm her not even water
[2:40:42] death for if the seed be planted the
[2:40:45] water will raise it up again here is the
[2:40:48] secret of this the word is where in the
[2:40:52] bride as he was where in Mary
[2:40:55] [Applause]
[2:40:58] the bride has the estimate of who Christ
[2:41:01] for she knows what he wants done with
[2:41:04] the word
[2:41:06] she performed the water command of the
[2:41:09] word the command of the word in his
[2:41:11] water name for she has that sets the
[2:41:14] Lord then the word is quickened by who
[2:41:17] the spirit and he come to Water Pass
[2:41:20] like a seed that is planted in water he
[2:41:22] comes to full Harvest serving water its
[2:41:25] purpose the reason why God unfolded your
[2:41:29] plan is God has seen your potential
[2:41:37] now it's up to you to believe who you
[2:41:40] are
[2:41:41] and what God is saying about you
[2:41:45] and now you act upon it
[2:41:50] father help me
[2:41:52] glory to God
[2:41:54] brother Branham saying when you come to
[2:41:56] Total obedience then you can have water
[2:41:59] possession but until you totally obey
[2:42:03] you got to completely do it Surrender
[2:42:06] Your Own thoughts your water own will
[2:42:09] mine and let the mind of Christ do what
[2:42:13] operate in you so when God bring your
[2:42:16] revelation or your vision or your plan
[2:42:20] you must change
[2:42:24] you must turn the switch
[2:42:26] from manual to automatic
[2:42:31] everybody okay you must remove manual is
[2:42:35] you doing everything
[2:42:36] you the one pushing the gear you're the
[2:42:39] one pushing the whatever you the one
[2:42:41] doing
[2:42:42] you need to remove that you need to push
[2:42:44] it in automatic
[2:42:46] amen and when you push automatic it is
[2:42:49] not your mind it is the computer mind of
[2:42:52] the car that begin to change the gears
[2:42:58] come on
[2:42:59] everybody okay automatic doesn't mean
[2:43:02] he's out of control
[2:43:04] automatic means their heart their mind
[2:43:07] of the computer has taken over the car
[2:43:12] [Music]
[2:43:13] so when God bring you your plan your
[2:43:17] project your Revelation whatever he
[2:43:20] wants you to do at a specific time you
[2:43:23] need to humble yourself
[2:43:26] [Applause]
[2:43:29] you need to lower yourself
[2:43:32] you need to release your mind your
[2:43:35] matter
[2:43:36] your sake you need to give it away and
[2:43:40] you must let now the mind of God begin
[2:43:43] to operate in you in other words you
[2:43:46] need to move out of your way
[2:43:50] because you will be blocking yourself
[2:43:53] because you are the poorest of your
[2:43:55] family
[2:43:55] because you are the least of your family
[2:43:57] God already knows that move out of the
[2:44:00] way let God do his own work
[2:44:05] father help me brother Brahman says this
[2:44:08] if we could throw ourselves wow
[2:44:11] completely to God and to his water will
[2:44:14] and be lost to our own that and just let
[2:44:18] the mind of Christ beware in us damn
[2:44:22] same operations of the spirit will work
[2:44:26] through us just as the Natural Things
[2:44:29] does just the same because we were first
[2:44:34] genesis created for that purpose
[2:44:38] to do what control to do what to rule to
[2:44:41] do what and to praise God to do what
[2:44:43] live for God Jesus say if ye abide in me
[2:44:46] and my word abide in you you can ask
[2:44:49] what you will and it shall be given unto
[2:44:52] you if he abided me and my word about
[2:44:54] what in you so when the program of God
[2:44:57] is revealed to Gideon Gideon not
[2:45:00] surrender his thought
[2:45:02] and believe What God Says
[2:45:05] Mary must surrender her thought and say
[2:45:08] be unto me according to what you have
[2:45:11] said Paul have to surrender his thought
[2:45:13] and say you know what I believe that
[2:45:16] angel it's just going to be as the
[2:45:18] Angels say matter of fact I change I'm
[2:45:20] not anxious anymore I can eat now
[2:45:22] because for 14 days I was not able to
[2:45:24] eat now that I got a revelation from God
[2:45:27] that everything will be okay that's not
[2:45:30] my problem
[2:45:31] even if you bring shock in the ocean I'm
[2:45:34] laughing no shark will bite me
[2:45:36] amen there won't be no shark biting me
[2:45:39] when a shark come he sees me he proved
[2:45:42] to the other direction
[2:45:51] when your vision is revealed even demon
[2:45:55] will avoid you
[2:45:56] when you go to the hospital when you go
[2:45:59] to your work people are coughing
[2:46:02] beside you but you go home nothing
[2:46:05] happens because the semen knows you're
[2:46:07] not the one they're supposed to attack
[2:46:10] [Applause]
[2:46:16] let me land the ship my friend brother
[2:46:19] Branham say what is faith
[2:46:24] bear with me I'm going to land the ship
[2:46:26] he says what is faith
[2:46:28] faith is something that is revealed to
[2:46:32] you
[2:46:33] I'm reading brother
[2:46:35] that is not yet
[2:46:37] but you believe it will be
[2:46:40] faith is a revelation of the will of God
[2:46:46] [Applause]
[2:46:48] the will of God for your life God reveal
[2:46:52] it to you by faith
[2:46:53] so what you call Faith is not just faith
[2:46:57] it is the will of God for you it is what
[2:47:01] God wants you to do it is what God is
[2:47:04] expecting from you
[2:47:06] and God bring it as a faith
[2:47:10] as a revelation as a vision you must
[2:47:13] take it
[2:47:15] because once it's revealed it don't
[2:47:17] belong to God anymore
[2:47:18] father help me up brother Branham say
[2:47:21] just simple trying to hide behind some
[2:47:24] kind of church doctrine instead of
[2:47:26] coming out and saying you ain't got no
[2:47:28] faith that's all
[2:47:32] Satan
[2:47:34] never received the Holy Ghost
[2:47:41] and will never receive the Holy Ghost
[2:47:44] he ain't got nothing than to give you
[2:47:47] what faith
[2:47:49] it's God that is God the faith
[2:47:53] and just as you are filled with God you
[2:47:56] are filled with water babe
[2:48:01] you are the Son of God you are like her
[2:48:04] God
[2:48:05] speaks the word and he creates itself
[2:48:08] his word the creative power
[2:48:12] how how the world come here he made it
[2:48:16] out of Faith which was not he just said
[2:48:18] Let It Be and here it is he believes
[2:48:21] he's on what word
[2:48:26] let me nail it here when God bring you
[2:48:29] the program of your life when God bring
[2:48:32] you your package your gift because
[2:48:35] whatever you have is a free gift of God
[2:48:38] everybody okay when God brings it to you
[2:48:40] God is transferring his omnipotence
[2:48:46] in other words God now expects you to
[2:48:50] behave like him
[2:48:54] because he belongs to him he was the one
[2:48:57] responsible to do it now he changed he
[2:49:00] gave it to you now you the one to do it
[2:49:02] that's why the Bible say all things are
[2:49:05] possible to God and all things are
[2:49:08] possible to him that believe when you
[2:49:11] believe you become like God
[2:49:16] father help me learn this ship Ephesians
[2:49:19] 2 verse 8 the Bible says for by grace
[2:49:22] are you what to say through what faith
[2:49:25] and that not of yourself
[2:49:29] it is water the gift of God so faith is
[2:49:32] what the gift of God because everything
[2:49:34] was given to you how
[2:49:39] ever thing that belongs to you is free
[2:49:41] even your faith is free
[2:49:46] [Applause]
[2:49:49] your faith is a gift because what
[2:49:53] they're bringing you is already a gift
[2:49:58] is not the word you cannot manufacture
[2:50:01] faith
[2:50:02] you don't work for faith God will
[2:50:05] deliver that to you
[2:50:10] the Bible say in James 1 every good gift
[2:50:14] and every how perfect give is from where
[2:50:18] above and cometh down from the father of
[2:50:21] what light with whom is know what
[2:50:23] variableness need a shadow of waters
[2:50:29] something God will never change his mind
[2:50:33] [Applause]
[2:50:35] God can never sit down and say I made a
[2:50:39] mistake
[2:50:41] even if you make a mistake after you
[2:50:45] receive it he won't change God's program
[2:50:53] because Moses never lost Moses
[2:51:01] God told him he's not going to enter in
[2:51:03] the Promised Land
[2:51:04] what was he doing on man Transfiguration
[2:51:09] how did he get there
[2:51:12] how did he get there
[2:51:14] how did he get there
[2:51:18] in other words God will never lose Moses
[2:51:21] he won't change his mind about you once
[2:51:25] God give you something that said God
[2:51:27] cannot come and say you know when you
[2:51:30] ask me I was too busy I didn't hear what
[2:51:33] you're saying
[2:51:34] and now I realize that what you were
[2:51:36] asking me was big we need to sit down
[2:51:39] and renegotiate God doesn't do that
[2:51:41] there is no valuableness
[2:51:44] was God opened his hand and give it to
[2:51:47] you it's forever
[2:51:49] not therefore can take it away from you
[2:51:52] that's why you must believe it that it's
[2:51:55] for me
[2:51:56] [Applause]
[2:51:58] [Music]
[2:52:00] let's now hear my brother
[2:52:02] brought him say I'm going to stop here
[2:52:04] we have faith in our heart
[2:52:06] the faith of who God in our hearts the
[2:52:10] faith of who God
[2:52:13] amen because it's a gift that's right
[2:52:16] God take his faith and drop it in you so
[2:52:19] that when he sends you his gift
[2:52:24] let me let me finish this way
[2:52:27] God wanna give you something
[2:52:30] he look at you he said she won't receive
[2:52:33] it God take a part of him
[2:52:36] and put in you
[2:52:37] and the path of God entering you and get
[2:52:40] into position to receive the gift so
[2:52:44] when God sent the gift God in you
[2:52:47] receives the gift so it's no longer you
[2:52:49] God is working with God to get you
[2:52:53] blessed
[2:52:56] [Applause]
[2:52:59] they're giving you a free gift of faith
[2:53:03] to receive the free gift from God so the
[2:53:06] one receiving the gift is faithful
[2:53:09] the faith of God
[2:53:11] so God is believing God
[2:53:13] [Applause]
[2:53:15] has happened
[2:53:16] [Applause]
[2:53:19] all you have to do is be out to me
[2:53:22] according to your word
[2:53:25] God will treat bless you let's stop here
[2:53:29] [Applause]

[2:53:51] [Applause]
[2:53:52] [Music]
[2:53:53] [Applause]
[2:53:55] why all this time you didn't believe it
[2:53:58] why do you only believe now
[2:54:01] what makes you believe
[2:54:05] Paul already received the Holy Ghost
[2:54:08] and the Holy Ghost was talking to the
[2:54:10] Holy Ghost so the Holy Ghost pick it up
[2:54:13] and that's it is God another word God is
[2:54:17] determined
[2:54:19] give you what he purposed to give you
[2:54:22] regardless
[2:54:24] and to make sure he doesn't fail he
[2:54:27] takes you out of the way
[2:54:28] so that himself speak himself receive
[2:54:31] and his mid-selves believe it
[2:54:34] and himself manifested
[2:54:37] all you have to say is be unto me
[2:54:39] according to your word and that's it
[2:54:42] and just continue your route
[2:54:45] Mary whatever happened will have to
[2:54:48] happen
[2:54:49] you must have faith
[2:54:51] in the vision you must have faith in the
[2:54:55] Revelation you must have faith in the
[2:54:57] world that God is speaking to you
[2:54:59] through this prophet
[2:55:03] when a preacher comes here and he's
[2:55:06] sending the word you must take it
[2:55:08] and believe it
[2:55:10] because why did you come to speak to me
[2:55:13] if it was not my time
[2:55:16] and even though he Terry
[2:55:18] wait
[2:55:20] division one life
[2:55:22] it might tell you according to us but he
[2:55:25] won't tell recording to God it will
[2:55:27] happen in his own time let's pray
[2:55:29] Heavenly Father
[2:55:31] Lord we are approaching you again humbly
[2:55:33] this afternoon
[2:55:35] father thanking you once again for your
[2:55:37] grace
[2:55:38] for your love and your mercy father and
[2:55:40] for everything you have been doing for
[2:55:42] us
[2:55:43] father thank you for speaking to us and
[2:55:46] unfolding this channel to us Lord
[2:55:49] so that whoever was struggling
[2:55:51] about this message maybe not here maybe
[2:55:54] elsewhere maybe who will listen to this
[2:55:57] later on
[2:55:58] father may you stabilize them to
[2:56:01] understand that this message is that
[2:56:03] safe for the Lord
[2:56:04] this is God provided way for this entire
[2:56:08] and when we cling to this message
[2:56:10] we are bound to success
[2:56:13] all the way to make it to the rapture
[2:56:15] because this message is the Original
[2:56:17] Seed it will produce itself according to
[2:56:21] it
[2:56:23] father
[2:56:24] many times you ask us things
[2:56:27] that humanly speaking when we look in
[2:56:30] the scripture
[2:56:31] we feel like we don't qualify
[2:56:34] and it's a human part of us
[2:56:36] where father you understand it well
[2:56:39] because you yourself when you look at
[2:56:41] the cross
[2:56:42] you ask the father
[2:56:44] to take the cup away
[2:56:46] but father nevertheless
[2:56:48] you humble yourself and you become
[2:56:50] obedient even to The Obedience of the
[2:56:53] Cross because you had to believe the
[2:56:56] vision and fulfill the vision as Paul of
[2:57:00] old says that he was not disobedient to
[2:57:03] the heavenly vision yes father each one
[2:57:06] of us here this morning those that are
[2:57:08] here and those that are streaming you
[2:57:11] have a purpose for our life
[2:57:13] you have an agenda for us yes and you
[2:57:16] taught us that it's for an expected end
[2:57:19] meaning we will come out right
[2:57:22] because you when you start a journey you
[2:57:25] are the alpha and you also the Omega
[2:57:27] and father I pray Lord father yes that
[2:57:31] you who says that faith is a gift
[2:57:33] may you help us Lord
[2:57:36] because we've grown up in a society
[2:57:38] that have built complex surrandas
[2:57:41] our family built complex around us
[2:57:44] our health our doctors
[2:57:47] father the civilization this cooling
[2:57:49] that we went through
[2:57:51] we poke so much in our memories
[2:57:54] until those things became a hindrance
[2:57:57] for the working of the spirit
[2:57:59] but father may you give us that
[2:58:01] revelation
[2:58:02] that will help us climb above our
[2:58:04] complexes
[2:58:05] so that we understand that when you're
[2:58:07] looking at us you don't look at the
[2:58:10] continents you don't look at the height
[2:58:12] you don't look at which family we came
[2:58:15] from you don't look Lord father about a
[2:58:18] position in the family whether we are
[2:58:20] the eldest or whether we are the middle
[2:58:22] or whether we are the youngest that's
[2:58:25] not what you're looking at you don't
[2:58:27] even look at the city saying that from
[2:58:29] Nazareth is a bad City if you were
[2:58:32] looking at the city Mary would have
[2:58:33] failed if you were looking at the family
[2:58:35] Gideon would not have been taken if you
[2:58:38] were looking at David he would not be
[2:58:40] Lord father elected but father you pass
[2:58:43] all those things
[2:58:44] and you look at your plan and the
[2:58:47] predestinated seed that you have with
[2:58:48] our individual life father that's why
[2:58:51] I'm praying Lord that you have that
[2:58:53] Faith to your children so that they can
[2:58:55] have faith to believe your word and
[2:58:58] father to Humble themselves and to obey
[2:59:01] totally to the vision to this message to
[2:59:05] Humble ourselves
[2:59:07] knowing Lord father that when we believe
[2:59:10] your prophet
[2:59:11] father who will prosper bless your
[2:59:14] children and strengthen them touch those
[2:59:16] that are sick and those Lord father that
[2:59:18] I have requests and expected certain
[2:59:20] things to happen father may you granted
[2:59:23] unto them we thank you for everything
[2:59:25] and commit this wonderful and precious
[2:59:27] congregation both visible and invisible
[2:59:30] unto the hand in Jesus precious name
