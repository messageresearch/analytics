going all the way and i'm going all the way because i'm predestinated it may sound confusing but it's the word so we thank the lord for it this evening it's good to be home good to be back in church we've been on the road we went to virginia and indiana and we were in service thursday night friday night saturday morning saturday night sunday morning some great services and god's truly been a blessing i tell you what me and my wife are on fire for the lord right now and nothing's going to stop us so we missed you here sunday but we replaced it with like four or five services and we still gotta catch up brother stephen i haven't heard sunday yet so i gotta i gotta listen to sunday before next sunday so um but god bless you all is there any testimonies this evening anybody have anything on their heart i have one myself actually when we were in indiana um we were outside of church getting ready to go in the church i think it was friday evening and i saw a brother walking like away from where i was at and i saw him from the back and i recognized his walk and it was a brother that i used to be in church with back in sarasota and he was actually a minister at the church in sarasota and his uh he went through a hard time in his life where his uh his wife and his kids left the message and he was all alone and his life kind of fell apart and i don't know what all his life went to i know it went to alcohol and he became an alcoholic and i know like he went out there and he i don't know if he got into drugs or not but as you as you would know i mean losing your wife and kids would would crush you and not not that that's an excuse but he was going through a hard season of his life and he left the church and i never saw him again i never saw him that was back when i was a teenager when i was like 15 or 16 or even younger and i never saw him and i was just sitting outside of church and i see him walking away like walking in the distance and i ran to him and i was like brother will and he turned around and i was like it is you and it was just i told him i said in that moment i told him i said if i get nothing else from these meetings this evening i said or this weekend i said it was enough for me to see you back serving god and i asked him his testimony and he shared his testimony with me he's been back in church for four years now and and i belie he told me his wife and kids are still not still not serving god at the time but yeah i for him to come back and forgot to restore him was a blessing it touched my heart and later on in service i think it was saturday we were people tarried and were praying at the altar and god put it on my heart to go pray for a couple people and i went back to my seat and before that brother left he came to our seat and he asked me and my wife to go to come to his house for dinner to talk to his kids because he knew the struggles that i went through in my life at the church that i was at and he wanted me to just be a testimony to his kids he wanted me to come talk to his kids and show them like even though i had hardship and i had struggles we're still in here we're still serving the message or serving the lord living this message and my wife as an example and i just thought lord lord is good he just even if that was the only reason for us to be out there in indiana i believe that that was enough so i was thankful to see that you know he's back in church he's serving god that's an incredible testimony and we just will remember his family this evening in prayer and i believe god will work that out sorry if it was a little lengthy but i just wanted to share that does anybody have a prayer request on their heart this evening anybody have anything on their heart anybody have an unspoken request on their heart they want to make known by the uplifting other hand davin could you come lead us in a word of prayer bear by hearts lord we come here lord for another day lord you brought us here again lord to come serve you lord we just want to thank you for bringing everybody here even the ones that aren't here lord that on the road lord may you protect them and you bring them here lord we put this service unto your hands lord may you bless our brother may you give him wisdom and you lead him lord do do this night lord may everything be on you in your hands lord we put everything up to your hands lord amen amen amen y'all may be seated as they gather does anybody have a special on their heart this evening anybody have a song on their heart all right who's that zaddy do you have something

each one of you again by the grace of god amen my family back at home they're attending church tonight at brother anderson's amen uh but we're here by the grace of god and i i pray that god's will be done because you didn't come here to hear from a man you never come to hear from a man and you got too many important needs to waste your time hearing from a man amen so we pray that god would just come and just have his way and just minister to your needs amen and help his people and he's faithful in that amen i know you all have been feeding well here amen i haven't actually heard brother stephen in a while myself uh my just my daily routine i don't get a chance to to really listen to much too many sermons on the internet and stuff like that i know you guys have a website or you stream or he was telling me about the streaming and all but i don't even get a chance really throughout the week to have time to go on the internet and listen to anybody it's just the way that my day runs by the time i get home and get settled it's time to go to sleep and then i'm waking up early normally about between four and five o'clock and i'm getting up and trying to get myself together to go to work so with having a large family and just different activities i just don't have the time to spend on on a lot of uh you know things of that nature but but god knows i but i know him and i i've always thanked god for his spirit amen and uh and how the lord has has used him over the years amen and so i know you're blessed and i know you're praying for him amen to the lord will continue to keep him and lead him and and guide him amen as he always has and god thank god for brother kelly amen he's always a blessing always been a blessing to me amen him and his wife praise the lord amen let's let's get right into the word i don't want to keep you long saints tonight i know it's a wednesday night and you all have maybe at times a distance to travel and i don't know what time you have to be to work in the morning but we'll try to uh keep to the subject here and and try to have you out here as soon as possible as the lord will permit praise the lord all right let's let's go saints if we will to i want to go to samuel first first samuel chapter three first samuel chapter three starting at verse one first samuel 3 starting at verse 1 it says and the child samuel ministered unto the lord before eli and the word of the lord was precious in those days there was no open vision and it came to pass at that time when eli was laid down in his place and his eyes began to wax them that he could not see and air the lamp of god went out in the temple of god where the ark of god was and samuel was laid down to sleep it says that the lord called samuel and he answered him i now i want you to just really follow this these next few verses here as far as god communicating with samuel and how samuel is responding and where he's thinking the voice is coming from he says here am i he says and he ran unto eli so god was speaking to him but he ran to eli why do you think he did that and said here am i for thou called us me and he said i call not lie down again and he went and laid down and the lord called yet again samuel and samuel arose and went to eli and said here am i for thou didst call me and i mean because think about it saying he's he's grown up with eli he knows the tone and the pitch of eli's voice so when he heard this voice to him without a shadow of a doubt he said that's eli he said here i am jesus i say i didn't call you [Music] amen he goes on to say in verse seven it says now samuel did not yet now listen samuel did not yet know the lord neither was the word of the lord yet revealed unto him and the lord called samuel again the third time and he arose and went to eli and said here am i for thou didst call me and eli perceived that the lord had called the child therefore eli said unto him unto samuel go lie down and it is and it shall be if he called thee that thou should say speak lord for thy servant heareth so samuel went and laid down in his place and the lord came and stood and called as at other times samuel samuel then samuel answered speak for thy servant heareth i have one more scripture saints i like to read it's in john chapter 8 in john chapter 8. i also want to reiterate uh what the brother the song conductor mentioned concerning uh sister zaddy um it wasn't until tonight that i realized she came here because she's come down to brother anderson's church and has blessed the church amen and i've always appreciated the songs that she sung because you can hear the heart that it comes from and there's an anointing that comes from a song that sung from that kind of a heart amen so it's not so much so how well of her how how how good a person's voice sounds is where it's coming from and when god is in it his spirit just kind of just moves along with that voice you know and you can feel it amen so we thank god for her so john chapter 8 it says in verse 39 they answered and said unto him abraham is our father jesus saith unto them if ye were abraham's children you would do the works of abraham but now you seek to kill me a man that that have told you the truth which have which i have heard of god he says this did not abraham says you do the deeds of your father then say if they unto him we be not born of fornication we have one father even god jesus said unto them if god were your father ye would love me for i proceeded forth and came forth and came from god neither came out of myself but he sent me now notice what he says here now he says why do you not understand my speech he says even because ye cannot hear my word year of your father the devil and the lust of your father ye will do he says he was a murderer from the beginning and abode not in the truth because there is no truth in him he says when he speaketh the lie he speaketh of his own for he is a liar and the father of it he says and because i tell you the truth ye believe me not which of you convinces me of sin and if i say the truth why do you not believe me he that is of god does what saints heareth god's words ye therefore hear them not because ye are not of god let's pray heavenly father please help us lord these are your people father this is your service god please lord help us to yield ourselves lord and just to be an oracle unto you father by your grace bless this church lord every member the pastor lord lord they mention the church that they have that they've been working on father how you've opened doors for them father and you're causing things to progress we just pray that you will continue to bless every effort lord and continue to move the enemy out of the way as he would try to block the progress of what you've ordained god help us all we pray tonight in jesus christ's name we ask it amen god bless you it's kind of a strange topic but uh it's just something that god was dealing with me on um i believe it's very important to each one of us a lot of what will be said tonight of course i'm sure you've heard before but i just pray that god take it and just give it to you in the way that you stand in need of amen so by god's grace tonight saints i want to try to to minister on a topic of voice recognition amen voice recognition uh this is very important i believe i know it's very important to me all right uh cause i don't know about you but uh i have a lot of thoughts that flow through my mind every day amen and i'm not the only one we all do amen but it's it's very important that that we be able to recognize where the thoughts are coming from um before i didn't notice i was i was in the place of samuel amen i didn't know the lord for those of you of course many of you don't know me but i grew up in the streets you see i didn't grow up in church i grew up in a drug house you know my mom was a drug addict she used crack cocaine and marijuana and all sorts of things and i was i'm the only child i don't have a brother or sister so i grew up in that kind of an atmosphere it wasn't always like that but it was certain people that was introduced into my mom's life and i could before my eyes see our whole life just change around it just it just turned in the wrong direction and it got to the point to where i had to move out and go live with my grandmother because my grandmother was very protective over me but nonetheless though i didn't grow up in a church going home you know but i can all i can say that by the grace of god i can truly say that by the grace of god i am what i am today and that's that's all tied into predestination regardless of what upbringing i had and what atmosphere i grew up within satan couldn't stop what god had ordained amen so i had to come to this place amen but nonetheless though i grew up in a worldly a worldly household and everything that you wouldn't want to be around i was forced to be around because it was my family you know the vulgarity and just everything you know so i'm growing up in that atmosphere and and and and they're on the closest thing i had to to to what i would consider to be god was my grandmother she she didn't fully live for god but she was the closest thing i had because she acknowledged him more than anybody else she had her mahelia jackson records she had the records and she would go into the room and and she would turn the mahelia jackson on and she would blast it you know all throughout the house and even though i heard it at a young age i didn't want to hear it you know so i would go in my room and i would turn up real loud my new addition and my boys boys to men so i i couldn't hear mahelia jackson but nonetheless though she was the closest thing i had so long story short it wasn't until i i met my wife who wasn't my wife at that time we she just started going to my high school and it wasn't until i met her that that through her and through her family i began to be exposed to the voice of god and i'm not talking about so much so the books and the tapes i'm saying as far as god actually speaking to me and i didn't know he was speaking to me i didn't know him something was speaking to me but i didn't know what was speaking to me i was like samuel god was talking directly to me but my i i i wasn't familiar with his voice i remember the first night that i i believe i received revelation of a part of his word it was my wife myself and her mother sitting in the kitchen and they were talking about something and and i don't know god was dealing with my heart so it's like my i began to be more and more interested in conversations that were pertaining to the word and so i was just listening to what they were talking about and then all of a sudden i began to actually understand and it was it got to it got to a point to where it was overwhelming to i couldn't sit down no more i just got up and started walking back and forth across the kitchen floor and i began to speak the things that was coming to my heart and my mother-in-law who had been in the way for a while she or she she recognized something she recognized something and i couldn't even recognize i just knew what was happening you see but it took some time and even now i don't have it all together like that i don't i even now since god talks to me and i don't pick up on it it ain't just me but we all are in that place and what satan doesn't want satan doesn't want us to become too in tune to the voice of god to the point to where we can recognize it and then yield to it so he has all sorts of ways to try to keep our minds and our spirits all bogged up and bogged down there's time saints where i know i know i can speak for myself where i know that the lord has placed it upon my heart to go and pray it's not that i hear an audible voice it's just like it's just i can't even explain it but it's a voice but it's not an audible voice like that it's just something that just kind of presses upon my heart and i hear something go and pray and then i try to make my way to go and pray but listen now see how many realize satan watches us our prophet told us that he studies us isn't that right he said if you're going to go and do something that's pertaining to god he said one of the things you can do to help yourself is not speak it out loud he said because if you speak it out loud then you give satan a a course to take to try to forerun you and to try to hinder what it is is on your heart to do for god and it's times when i'm sitting there and i i felt this impression i need to go and pray and sometimes i'll tell my wife i'm gonna go here and pray next thing you know the phone ringing listen now i want to be very careful in what i'm saying [Music] it it's a saint that's calling me [Music] and so because it's a saint you answer and once you answer then it happened to me recently then it dawns on me i shouldn't answer that phone [Music] because now i'm in a conversation but yet i got my heart being pulled to prayer but now i'm in a conversation that i shouldn't be in listen now it's not that it's sinful but it's it's idle talk it's not as important as what as the voice that told me to go and pray i should have obeyed that voice but satan saw what was happening and listen saints satan knows what happens in prayer amen the more we pray and the more we give ourselves over to the things of god guess what we become more sensitive [Music] amen we're able to be better led because we're in an atmosphere now now our minds are gathered from all over the place and placed directly on god now his instruction and his communication can become more clear in those places and satan don't want that so i'm talking to somebody that's not trying to do me wrong or any harm but they just don't realize that something caused them to call me at that moment you understand what i'm saying it's okay to talk on the phone the saints but then it's when god is calling you sometimes you just got to let the phone ring now that's what i've been having to do more so now so i see so and so is calling me but i need to go take care of this first so we'll talk to all day long brother branham told us the greatest battle that's ever fought is where and how many realize right now right now at this second at this moment the battle is raging right now in people's minds the devil is saying all sorts of things god is speaking also amen but depending on where listen now depending on uh where we've been spending our time if we've been neglecting prayer if we've been neglecting the reading of the word or the hearing of the word more than likely spiritually things are a little dull watch this this is from uh let me see what message this here this really struck me here saints amen this is from hear his voice he says every one of you people who profess to be christians get yourself quiet before him prayer is so important you see because we all are witnesses of this you can pray right and you're praying because you got burdens on your heart things you're releasing before god just you might be even giving god thanksgiving or what have you but but the voice of god speaking back to us sometimes that's mist i mean to realize you got to pray through [Music] cause just you you trying to you trying to break into a place but satan sees your efforts and even while you're on your knees you got all kinds of faults that begin to come to your mind why it's a spiritual war that devil is right there trying to hinder you from tapping in to that resource amen from that flow of your shady eye to receive what you stand in need of at that time so why are you in prayer brother brother even talked about it he's in prayer trying to get a message from god and satan began to cause his attention to go to nets i'm talking about the practical side of this now nets that are flying around his head satan is trying to get his attention on those gnats satan is trying to get him to feel the impression of the rocks that was on his knees while he was using that as a tactic saints to cause him to come out of prayer moving simplicity but understand me satan moving simplicity also he can move so common and so so simple that you can miss it which one of us would have thought that gnats flying around our head was the working of a devil that would try to hinder us you get to hearing the buzzing of the net you trying to swat next thing man you might say well let me just go pray later i mean let me go find someplace else to pray and why are you trying to go find someone else somewhere else to play somebody call you on the phone or you remember something or whatever just how the enemy operates you understand what i'm saying watch how he says this every one of you people who professes to be christians get yourself quiet before him he says don't let the washing hinder i need to put a load of clothes in the wash but god has already spoken he wants you to pray see as simple as that sisters and even brothers because i help my wife wash clothes too praise the lord he says don't let the washing hinder don't let the work hinder don't let nothing hinder don't let nobody know what you're doing he says just go before him he says get up in the woods somewhere get out in the side of the road he says go into the secret closet and close the door when the kids gets at school he says he says there get down on your knees you've heard all kinds of voices everywhere amen from the time we get up to the time we go to sleep we're bombarded with many voices amen but we it is within our best benefit amen to begin to recognize what those voices are and where they coming from so we can do what we can ignore the voice of the enemy sometimes you might have something going on in your life right it can be anything you could be from a bill or something that's kind of you know a little outside of your budget or you can have some sort of a issue going on in your body or whatever the case might be but you you don't realize that that it's actually satan will come and he'll stay in your mind and speak to you in a certain way to cause you to gain a certain perspective of your situation issue or whatever the case might be there are some people here that have spiritual problems right and satan talks to you but listen you're not you don't recognize that it's him i know people personally listen now i ain't nobody but sometimes when you listen to a person you can hear you can you can hear what voice they've been listening to watch and you can see that they don't realize it's the voice of the enemy some people are plaguing their minds always worrying about something or you know just something that just always lays heavy water makes something lay heavy on you like that to make you worry amen to make you overburden overwhelmed anxious god don't communicate like that and once you're able to realize that it's not the voice of god listen and it's not you either it's something that's trying to get you to think like it wants you to think it wants you to be in the fear it wants you to worry it wants you to doubt so you find yourself thinking about your situations it might even be relationships or family problems or something and the devil always wants you to look at it from a negative slant he wants you to feel like it's hopeless ain't nothing to be done about it it's too big for you you can't take much more that's a lie amen i don't care how long you've been dealing with a certain physical issue in your body how many realize god is still a healer that devil want to make us feel comfortable with these issues in our body amen but god is still here to perform his word saints but if we're not careful you can hear the voice of satan and not identify it as the voice of satan you just take it as is you watch this lord have mercy this right here is from the message of life is the healer pay attention to this very careful this thing is we ain't going to be much longer he says but now now this is a prayer line i want i want you to pay real good attention now to the activity because god is there but satan is there also how many realize that peter was in the very presence of god that brother had been walking on the water think about it i want i want you to think about this real good now don't don't let this one miss you pass you by saints that brother saw christ walking on the water and he said lord if that be you bid me come didn't he say that jesus said come that brother got out of that boat and started walking on water like it was solid ground i don't know how many steps he took but he was actually walking on water i'm talking about the power of the enemy in his words how many realized satan never laid a hand on eve i know the serpent did but hear me out before anything ever happened satan just listened he seized her and he began to control her by his words where did she make her mistake she considered what he was saying [Music] so peter walking on water the lord standing out there on water he walks to the lord standing right in front of christ in arms distance and the devil was right there listen and through thoughts he didn't recognize the devil's voice the devil in his mind began to speak things to make him focus in on how how the water was around him listen now listen now that brother was anointed amen under the inspiration and power of god but satan was able to pull him out of the anointing of god by his voice listen and what he was attracting his attention to and when his focus oh he began to he he listened when his mind when his thoughts shifted he physically began to sink and change his situation amen saints whenever god has told you by his word you've been healed amen and the devil trying to draw your attention to a symptom or something like that listen now you can actually listen you can actually cause your healing to leave you satan by the power of his word listen satan is a master psychologist that's all he does it's playing the human mind [Music] brother branham says he comes in full reasoning let me get to this watch this now prayer line this woman is in the presence of god but satan is there also watch this conversation he says now just till i till i catch your spirit again he says yes sir i see it coming back you have a shadow dark shadow that's following you which means that you got a cancer that's right he says and the cancer is on the leg he says that's the left leg that's right isn't it that's true he says i want to ask you something he says you have had a something accuse you in your lifetime even since a young lady that you have a desire and a feeling that god has something for you to do in his vineyard he says now as the people out there listen listen to how he says this now see he's sensitive listen he's consecrated himself to god see he lived a consecrated life see satan tried to make us play around with this stuff give god a little bit of time give everything else a lot of time and we wonder why we find ourselves defeated more times than we should be we're not giving ourselves over consecrating ourselves listen to the level that god is calling for i ain't gonna say to the level that you feel like but this brother is in a place and so now he's in such a place with god until that he's very sensitive to the spirit realm and he recognizes voices and where they're coming from watch what he says here now he says now lord have mercy where am i at this thing just jumped up on me praise the lord amen isn't that song don't worry we're going to get it right back again here we go all right here we go he says now as the people out there a thought meets me now from satan do you remember when peter jesus had just finished talking to peter and the disciples letting them know what he had to go through peter's standing right there listen now peter did not feel the devil he didn't recognize the change i'ma tell now listen saints it happens to all of us we've all been anointed by wrong spirits peter didn't hear the devil he didn't feel the devil listen he didn't know that the devil had begun to speak through his lips but what he began to say was contrary to the word and the bible says that jesus turned to his beloved brother his son his apostle and he rebuked him and he says get thee behind me satan where was he at he was speaking through peter and peter didn't even recognize it [Music] listen unless god helps us saints i know that we've been in this situation and unless god helps us we'll be in this situation too many more times say can actually get in your mind and speak through your lips and you're not even aware of what's going on but when we're in when we're in a consecrated place amen then the voice of god becomes more clear to us isn't that right and god is able to expose and reveal where the enemy is so now the prophet is here now and he's saying now a thought meets me now from satan outside of the outside realm that tells me not a devil is trying to fight against him while the lord is using him to deal with the woman he says satan thought came to him and tells me any woman has that desire trying to make him doubt the voice that's talking to him all right here the ballot is raising in the prophet's mind while he's under the anointing trying to do him trying to do what trying to cause him to come out of the anointing he says i'll go and show shame that he's a liar see he's in a place now where satan can't hide when satan spoke he recognized it he wasn't like peter a man he recognized it and he began to come against it how blessed saints would it be for you and i every time an evil spirit tries to come to us and make us yield to it to be able to recognize that voice and rebuild the devil versus finding ourselves yielding and then after certain things are done are said then realizing that oh that was an evil spirit upon says by this and you know that i'm telling you the truth and you know whether it's god or not he says you've never been spiritually that's how he says this he told the woman you've never been spiritual enough in your life to accept what god has promised you spiritual health through consecration how many of us in here tonight have failed to become spiritual enough everybody in here want to know their purpose right that's just for you to ponder in your own heart how much are you giving yourself to god you've never been spiritual enough in your life to accept what god has promised you to do he says that is right isn't it you're needing the holy ghost he says that's exactly right you're seeking for it now the baptism of the holy ghost he says that's thus saith the lord he says and beside that if i tell you something he says you were very happy today you had to make a big decision you were supposed to fly away from this city you are not from this city you were supposed to fly away from here to a funeral service and you put it off now listen you put it off in order to get to the meeting tonight what told her to put it off it was god but she didn't know it was god she just thought it was a thought or a decision she needed to make she didn't realize it was god talking to her isn't that something so likewise the devil could talk to you and you not realize it but god also can talk to you and you not realize it and you put it off in order to get to the meeting tonight because something told you that you was going to receive a prayer card what was that something that was jesus christ when you received the prayer card not being number one you were surprised he says but when the angel of the lord so ordained it that i call you first you were happy he says that's right he says is that the truth he says now you are healed in the name of the lord god because god has ordained it to be so he says going he says go and may god be with you my dear sister so in that one meeting that the devil talked to the prophet the prophet talked back to the devil the devil talked to the woman the woman didn't know what was going on but the grace of god prevailed even though we've not been in a place that i believe we should be spiritually how many realize the grace of god amen the grace of god saints he fills in so many gaps for us amen are they because we've been the best or or the most obedient or anything like that it's just because of who we are and what we mean to him i'm gonna leave you with this one saints this is some questions and answers now it's a question that came to brother branham and maybe somebody in here might have this exact same question i don't know cause i want to say this all right even though we're here tonight we're here because we realize we need help we realize we ain't where we need to be right and amongst us saints i know that there are spiritual conditions some people are bound by certain bad [Music] habits but because you are bride you feel all uneasy you maybe even have tried to give yourself over to certain things and god by his grace wouldn't let you go as far as the devil wanted to take you [Music] but yet you play around with certain things too much things you should stay away from you find yourself being attracted to and you know that it's wrong you know you've been battling with it but you just find yourself yielding too much and because of a lack of a consecrated life amen you find yourself being weak amen and having to repent over and over and over again asking the lord to forgive you but in the devil see now he sees what's going on god sees what's going see god will god allow god will allow you to go through things like that god could just take everything right away from you right but he wants you to want it gone if you take it away away from you and you still desiring it that ain't no good but god want to bring you to a place to where you see what it is for what it is and you you begin to put it down completely when you get tired enough of it listen the time is taken away from you it's robbing you of so much for a little moment of some kind of fleshy pleasure of some kind maybe you got somebody in your life you ain't supposed to have in your life maybe you're having a conversation with people you shouldn't be having and in your heart you know it but you feel chained you feel like like you can't break loose you tried but that lust is so pulsating inside of you so you find yourself falling again and again and again then if you're not careful the devil will come to you and he'll begin to tell you maybe you're not a child of god maybe this ain't for you do you realize that's how he's captured many that have left the message they found a desire on the inside of them that that just seemed to grow stronger you know what the more you yield yourself to the devil's thoughts his voice does become magnified [Music] but this is somebody who satan's voice became magnified in them but because they were a true child of god amen the day of their deliverance had to come for every one of us there's true bribe members i don't care what you've been struggling with and how long you've been struggling with it just know that your time is coming amen the devil has a set date that he has to leave your life amen listen now and the grace of god listen i'm telling you saints i i ain't the only one you just find that you you just find yourself looking back sometimes and oh lord this thing don't bother me no more what doesn't happen listen the power of god justin came in amen and he's he's broke the chain of the devil all for your life listen now and you may not even have recognized it was done god got to stop you and make you realize what he's done that you might give him glory for it listen now and gain strength from that testimony to help you to overcome everything else that might be in your life that's what testimonies are for when david saw what happened to the line in a bear goliath was nothing watch this now this person had a question he says this person says i've lived i have lived many years in sin until i found the lord please brother braddam i have sinned again and i'm not worthy to come before you in this holy place please tell me if i can be restored whole again brother branham ain't had to wake up wait a second he immediately responded yes and was he just trying to make the person feel good no it isn't and not ain't that that's not what was happening watch this saints praise god he says you have not seen my friends so far in god but what you could be restored listen to this now if you had sinned so far that you could not be restored you never want to be restored sure you might have a spiritual trouble but pay attention to what's in your heart see you feel uneasy you feel unsettled you feel bad you feel convicted you don't want to remain that way even though you get knocked down some tell you to get back up again you just find yourself not not being able just to give up what is that that's the voice of god amen doing what encouraging you in your time of weakness and your time of hurting pain just by having a desire to continue to fight that's a blessing within itself the devil don't want you to see that's a major sign that you are a child of god no matter how many times you failed him he ain't counting like that he ain't keeping tabs like that he's just letting you go through your course because in the end you're gonna come out like gold after i am tried job says then shall i come forth as gold how many believe that when you can have that kind of a mindset in the midst of your trouble in the midst of your battle amen the devil can't do nothing with that saints you gotta have the mind of an overcomer when i was in the marine corps we had several battles that that that sparked up overseas over there in the middle east and i had a friend of mine that was there in platoon with me and he told me he said i had a dream i had a dream that i heard a loud explosion and all of us were standing sitting in the trench together i heard that loud explosion man i don't think we made it i was in the world but i just had some men me you weren't going to speak no negative mess over my life i said brother i don't know what your dream meant but if i go over there i'm telling you i'm coming back again amen and that's exactly the mindset change we got to have no matter how many times you've been knocked down amen no matter how many times you failed god something on the inside of you gotta let you know and i'm still an overcomer i'm still coming out of this i will not be defeated amen that's what the lord does to the hearts of his believers he gives us strength the bible said he sent his word and he healed them you've not seen my friends so far in god this is what you couldn't be restored if you had sin so far that you couldn't be restored you never want to be restored see but as long as there is something dealing with your heart you're still in line of restoration guilty of the lease is guilty of the whole i have sinned many times a prophet saying himself i have sinned many times every day every one of us do things we're not we don't want to do he says it's in your heart our heart you don't want to be that way or you wouldn't ask the question that's he says that's itself or proof that god still is dealing with you you've probably gotten nervous probably satan telling you that you can't be restored he says he's lying to you but the person wasn't able to recognize the voice of the devil [Music] when you hadn't been trained when when you when you when your heart when you hadn't been trained to that voice and you don't you don't really like samuel you don't realize that it's god he says because look if there he's a because if there is a deep calling there's got to be a deep to respond to the call if there's a hunger for something that something's got to be somewhere or you wouldn't he's you wouldn't have no hunger for it so if we're desiring to be just like christ then there is a supply for me and for you isn't that right to satisfy that desire god is here amen and he's that supply to issue to you to your soul exactly what you're standing in need of to quench that hunger in that thirst can we all stand together i just want us all to pray together and pray for one another it's going home time amen and i don't care how much the devil begins to rage amen god is in full control let us pray heavenly father lord we are your people we are your children and right now we want to give you thanksgiving lord for everything that you've ever done for us everything that you're doing for us right now father god we thank you for your word lord that you sent forth in this hour to bring healing to each one of us lord in our body father god and our soul and our spirits father lord your people are believing you tonight lord we don't care how much of a battle we've had to fight but whatever it was we've been fighting with father we're more than conquerors lord through you that loved us father god you've given us the faith that we stand in need of to be able to overcome all the things of the world all the obstacles of the world lord i pray that you would help every one of us break past the voices of the devil father god and of every evil spirit that will try to hinder us lord and help us to become more in tune to your voice father and to yield ourselves to that voice lord that you might be glorified and you might be able to have your way more so in our lives according to your good pleasure father lord be with every one of us lord give us strength father god we pray for one another lord god you know every one of us in particular lord you are our father heavenly father lord grant strength lord god grant understanding where it's needed lord everything that we stand in need of lord god lord to come free we're free already you set us free already lord lord help us to claim our victory help us to claim our freedom lord help us to shake away from the voices of the end of the enemy father god amen lord and may we be confident and become more familiar with your voice by your grace god we thank you thank you jesus thank you lord his strength is perfect when our strength is [Music] raised a man raised [Music] amen [Music] let's is that one more times thank you [Music] me [Music] hallelujah amen his strength is perfect [Music] see that strength is made perfect in weakness amen take your bible in job chapter 33 that's a masterpiece young people if you have a struggle how god speaks this is your answer somebody asked me that question recently and the lord brought a whole message unfolding all these things to us amen the voice that ela was hearing in the temple [Music] the voice that samuel was hearing in the temple do you think that it was by mistake that god called and he was going to samuel amen [Music] so when god is calling he went to samuel when god is calling he went to samuel [Music] he went to ilah actually god is calling he went to elah god is calling he goes to ila another word of torn god used [Music] was the tone of the priest that was there for that time amen that's why when you listen to the message [Music] we call it the voice of god amen that's why brother branham said you are not feeding on the words of men but you are feeding upon the unfailing body word of the son of man you might think it's the voice of brother branham yes the tone is brother branham but the content of that tone is god speaking to this generation through a vessel amen job chapter 33 verse 14 hallelujah what a masterpiece that's why you can hear the message you can hear the message you can hear the message but one of this day like we heard the testimony last sunday you're going to come into a personal revelation with the god of the message and that's it then you're going to say speak lord that servant here is that job chapter 33 verse 14. are you there if you're there you can say amen the bible say god speak once yey twice yet man perceive it in other words it means for god speaks again and again though people do not recognize it amen sometimes we are waiting for that audible voice where god is putting an impression in your heart to go ahead and do something sometimes you're waiting for that to come a different way and then you can talk to somebody and they say something and it triggers you just like that the brother opened the scripture and was reading john 8 and i was sitting there and i seen something in marriage and divorce open up in that scripture right there he was not preaching marriage and divorce he didn't know i'm i have been studying marriage and divorce left and right how did he know that just be sensitive feed the white dog and you're going to be more sensitive to recognize the voice of god and to eliminate the other voices amen brother mike brad said he was not a sinner that called him sometimes he can anoint a brother just like brother peter was anointed and if you don't recognize somebody can take you and pull you down and you just woke up in the morning so happy and trying to praise the lord try to pray to the lord and somebody calls you and you pick up her phone and you left the phone and you say i don't even know why did i pick up that phone everything all the anointing all the joy all the happiness that you have is completely drawn down because you were not you didn't recognize what god was trying to tell you yes we need to answer a phone but we need to give preeminence to the lamb of god amen when it's time to go to church i'm gonna lay everything aside because i'm going to church amen if you come to visit me when i have to go to church i'm going to tell you straight that i'm going to church you can come another time i am not chasing you but i'm standing on my ground amen that woman have to push away a funeral because god wanted to bless him amen when jesus was talking about those that were invited there were reason and reason and reason and if you chase the scripture you're going to find out that all those reasons were legitimate reason that jesus turn around and say let the dead bury the dead in other words put me first follow me first i know it's your father how can you leave your father funeral to follow christ what kind of preeminence is he looking for because god came and gained that preeminence in christ and brother branham said now the preeminence have to be in his brother church give god his first place amen when it's time to sleep turn your cell phone off put it to silence go to sleep solomon say there is a time for everything there is a time to talk there is a time to be quiet there is a time to pray there is a time to laugh when it's time for the things of god put it aside it's my time to read my bible i have to finish reading my bible before i do this it's time for prayer and home i cannot leave this home until we pray you don't know what that prayer can do as you driving on the road amen never never never be like eso who for the mess of meal he didn't value the birthright he didn't know it's gonna cost him his entire inheritance amen stand on your position it's time to go to church let's go we have church tomorrow this is saturday why do you stay up till two o'clock are you preparing a sermon are you preparing to preach in the morning you're not even preaching and you are sitting just talking fellowshipping with people till 2 30 and you go to bed and you're gonna come to church late and you're coming to church late because you don't understand that tomorrow is sunday when it's sunday i'm not playing games when muslim have to pray they even close their shop because it's the time to go to pray these are muslims they don't even have what we have here amen when was the last time you yielded unto god you say god give me a job where i cannot work on wednesday i wanted to be in service not only be in service but i want to be in service on time i want to be there 30 minutes before they start i don't want to be late all the time i don't want to be late on sunday all the time i don't want to keep missing sunday i don't want to keep missing wednesday because the time has come where god is calling he's what else do you want in this world everything is not working anymore the gas price is high the goods are high everything is going up what else do you have for hope but the widow of sarepta had the voice of elijah that could create the male and create the old the voice of elijah has been given to this church we have the message of the hour we have the devil's answer we know what to do let it drop in your heart give god preeminence give god preeminence be sensitive to his voice and the lord will bless you heavenly father lord we thank you again for your grace father for your love and for your mercy lord if it was not for your grace many species could have been stay empty and we could be in a lot of trouble but further even when we feel like we are corner left and right and there is no outlet lord father you always provide an emergency bullet of grace that will free your predestinated seed and lord father leaders home father made this message down go lord in the mind in the brain of the people but may he suck deep lord and may the holy spirit continue to minister to your children as they go into the respective place lord father may you speak to them deeply give them a revelation again lord and help us all together oh father to always recognize which voice is coming which thought are we receiving which conversation are we engaging to father so that we can make a difference between lord the work of the devil and the voice of god because your prophet told us that to overcome is to recognize the devil in his tactics lord father if in the presence of your anointing father the devil could sit there trying to shift your prophet how much more lord father your children this pride lord father that you have given in this end time lord give us grace to endure no matter what's going on no matter our failure no matter the difficulties no matter the symptom lord but may we realize lord that we are not looking on doors lying vanity but we are looking lord father at the promise of god because the one who gives the promise he doesn't lie he's not even a man to repent lord father help each one of us in our our individual life lord as we commit it all and to the hand lord in the name of jesus christ in the name of jesus christ amen brother you can lead us in one song and you dismiss god bless you church to remember the service and continue to consecrate and to pray let god have a personal relationship between you and him you and him alone when he speak you will recognize his voice amen real quick before we start singing this song while i was sitting in that seat right there and brother shango started to speak something told me to look up the definition of eli the name it means my god high in hebrew it means my god high ascent my god and i thought man that was powerful just like the preacher was saying when samuel thought it was eli speaking to him but it was god [Music] you know i'm so grateful for a voice in this age that god spoke through and we can look at it and say my god not to bring glory to the man but we just know it was god speaking through the man [Music] your majesty [Music] you're in this place please let me stay and rest in your holiness or to god speak would you pour down that grain washing my eyes to see your majesty to be still and know you're in this
