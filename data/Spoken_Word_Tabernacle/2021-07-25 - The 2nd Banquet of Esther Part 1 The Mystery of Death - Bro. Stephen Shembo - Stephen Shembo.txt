fly right there on the screen finally i pray i say god will you help me kill this fly amen i say i remember and the scripture came in my mind that the lord when he brought the quail he brought them so low he even decreased their speed so that the jews can just go and grab them and take him i say father if you did it for the quail i want this flight to come and slow him down very slow let him come slowly like the quail so i can kill him and i begin to work work after a while here comes the fly with a very slow speed [Laughter] amen and sat right there on the laptop screen so if i hit the laptop

you don't need god only for big stuff even for breathing you need god everything that you do you just need god you lost a key just pray god you lost your watch pray god amen remember the building fund and let's go to our scripture blessed be the name of the lord amen hosea chapter 13. hallelujah faith is so simple so simple so simple if god can help me with that fly i don't see what god cannot do for you amen he's not the god of the big stuff only or even the small stuff and if he can do the small stuff you can even speak to the mountain the mountain look big to you not to god he is the one that created the mountain hallelujah we the one that were trained that the mountain is a big thing oh that those mountains are big the king's mountain are big that's the way we were breathed when adam was bred there was nothing for him he could just move them left right nothing hosea chapter 13 verse 12. verse 12 if you dare you can say amen yeah we're changing gears and getting back up to the surface when i say it back up to the surface you need to be in tune in the message because you're going to wonder because when i say backup we're just soaring like a rocket amen so if you don't read your bible you don't listen to the message it's a problem hosea 13 verse 12 the iniquity how many knows what iniquities something that you know better not to do and you do it don't worry tight dress you wear tight dress it's iniquity because you already know better amen all right thank you brother kelly we got wired pretty good we say the iniquity of ephraim is bound in other words it's collected you might be seated god is talking about ephraim here we know that joseph had two children ephraim and manasseh right ephraim was the youngest one and manasseh was the oldest one and when jacob was about to bless his children he had to cross the hand amen and brother branham explained to us that he was the blessing that was supposed to go to the jews going into the gentile everybody clear so we're talking about ephraim here which is a gentile nation or gentile church ephraim a gentile church anybody clear what's going on with this gentile church blessed be the name of the lord the bible says that there is iniquity in this church amen so this church have already the knowledge of god given to them anybody clear but despite the fact that they have the knowledge of god they just don't want to do it they don't want to do it that's why it's iniquity anybody created so far so they know something better but there is something about ephraim that he doesn't want to do what god is asking him to do amen the scripture continues the iniquity of ephraim is bound in other words it's collected god collects it it's burned up his sin is hidden in other words god watched ephraim and god already gave his word to ephraim god spoke to ibrahim and demonstrated to ephraim all the territory of the black dog amen god unfolded the mystery to the point that even a baby will know what's going on but despite the knowledge and the understanding and the revelation that ephraim got ephraim still doesn't want to do what god is asking him to do everybody clear so because of that god comes and collects the iniquity of ephraim and store it anybody clear amen verse 13 the sorrows of a travailing woman shall come upon him he is a water he is an unwise son who is wisdom and he is a wise meaning he lacks wisdom remember the boy in uh in proverbs 7 anybody clear now sorrow of a travailing woman shall come upon him he is unwise and unwise son why is he unwise four he should not stay long in the place of the breaking forth of children how many understand that this is why praise god let me help you in another translation the bible says that pain has come to the people like the pain of a child birth but they are like a child who resists being born everybody the moment of birth was arrived but they stay in the womb so ephraim was in the womb and it was time for ephraim to be born so the pain and the travel came upon the mother of ephraim but ephraim doesn't want to come out and because of that he's an unwise son because he's staying too long in the delivery ephraim is holding mommy too long in a delivery mommy wanna tell him hey you need to come out for him say i don't want to come out it is a son that does not like to be born again [Music] everybody clear he hates the new birth when god tells him what to do he doesn't want to do what god wants him to do he still want to stay in the position that he is he's still connected to the high heel he's still connected to the bad dressing he's still collected connected to everything that god displayed unto him not to do in other words he doesn't want to be born god came to give him an opportunity to clean up his life so that he can be born but ephraim doesn't want to be born the sorrow of a travel woman shall come upon him he is an unwise son why are you unwise for he should not stay long in the place of the breaking forth of children in the delivery home verse 14 i will ransom them from the power of the grave i will redeem them from death so there is two things here that is waiting for ephraim one of them is death and another one is water the grave because if you stay on mama too long you don't want to come out you're going to end up dying anybody clear and when you die the next step is they're going to take you to the grave now the scripture is clear i will ransom them from the power of the grave i will redeem them from death or death i will be your water plagues or grave i will be your water so ephraim here is afraid of two deaths there is a death to be born again is to die on your own anybody here die on the self it's a self death ephraim doesn't want it he's afraid he doesn't want to come out and there is a second death that is right there is a death that's going to put him in the grave so the first death he doesn't want to be separated and the second death is going to put him to the grave both of those deaths are looking at ephraim but god is coming down to rescue him anybody clear i will ransom them from the power of the grave i will redeem them from death or death i will be your plug now god is threatening death anybody clear oh grave i will be your destruction repentance shall be hidden from my eyes this is not for the serpent seed when god is determined to do something gift and calling are without water so whether you repent or not they are there anybody clear so when god is determined to get his elect anybody clear god will even bypass certain things just to get you where you are and to get you out so that he can rescue you anybody clear because this child is about to die still born because he has he doesn't want to be a a boner he doesn't like a birth and death is also over there trying to kill him anybody care repentance shall be hidden from my eyes i'm not looking at that anymore i'm determined that my plan is going to take place regardless whether you want it or not i am coming down for you anybody clear you don't want to repent i am coming down i'm going to turn the devil everywhere i'm gonna turn everything upside down i'm gonna push you to the corner until i get you out of that because you don't want to come out from the womb even though you have been preached so long and you don't understand that not only the natural i mean the spiritual birth is a problem there is also death plus grave that is about to attack you let's go to first corinthians 15 hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord brother mike do we have another sharpie this is sinking in i can still work with it though if you can find it first corinthians chapter 15. if you dare you can say amen everybody clear you need to be wired pretty good because i am taking off amen if not it's going to generate a bunch of questions and answers amen which is still fun first corinthians 15. you grown up now it's time to eat solid food thank you very much they should look like this okay verse 27 for he god has put all things under his feet jesus but when he says all things are put under him it is manifested that he is accepted in other words when god says that he took everything and put under jesus christ so jesus christ is above everything anybody clear so when it's under him it doesn't mean he's under himself he is the exception everybody clear he is the top everybody clear all things are put under him it is manifested that he is accepted which did put all things under water god is not going to be under christ because christ and god are amen verse 28. and when all things shall be subdued to him then shall the son also himself be subject to him that put all things under him there is no true god here it is the offices that are working amen he is in the office of the son they're putting everything under him when they finish that office then he goes back to the father then we ascended back again and he goes to god amen because the son of god is who we already shown to you it's in uh john 5 28 or something like that about here amen job to verse 51 behold i show you a mystery we shall not on water sleep means water we shall not all die but we shall all be water so some people will die some people will not die but for sure whether you die or you stay alive we all gonna be changed anybody clear death let's go to hebrew chapter two ephraim doesn't want to come out he doesn't like the birth it cost him a lot he's going to cost him his friend it's going to cost him his facebook his instagram his clothing ibrahim doesn't want to come out he doesn't want to die to himself he doesn't understand that if he doesn't come out there is another death that is waiting for him and that death is always accompanied with grief anybody clear then everything was put on the crust except who christ who is god himself but not everybody is gonna die some people won't die i am among them it's up to you to claim it i'm going to see jesus alive hebrew chapter 2. the scripture cannot be broken amen hebrew chapter 2 verse 7. everybody there you can say amen you made him a little lower than the angels who's that person jesus you made him a looter lower than the angel you crowned him with glory and honor and indeed set him over the work of your hands just like adam he's the second adam ever clear watch verse 8 you have put all things back again to corinthians you have put all things in water in subjection in other words under his control in subjection under his water under the feet of christ everybody understand four in that he put all in subjection under him he left what that is not put under him but now we see not yet all things put under paul is saying that in the mind of god in the position that christ have everything is under the control of christ ever here accept christ himself because he's god but paul is saying that even though all things are already given to christ all things are under the feet of christ yet when we observe there is something that it looks like it's not controlled yet by christ there is something else that is still free amen yet he has everything under control but there is something that looks like it is not under control yet what is that anybody clear let me read it again so you get it you have put all things in subjection under his feet for in that he put all things under him he left nothing in other words all around him that is not put under him but now in the present time that is already finishing the man of god but in the present time in what we are living today but now we see not yet all things put under him there's something that is not under him anybody clear verse 9 but we see who jesus who was made a little water now you got your answer right okay which is made lower who was made lower than the angel for the suffering of water the purpose of christ was to suffer water anybody clear to suffer death comer quran with god glory and honor that he by the grace of god should test what for who why should i testify if he tested for me did it make sense you're not going to hell because jesus went to hell for your place it's a combo there is a hamburger there is a tomato there is a chicken there is pickles all of them it is not just not going to help for me he also tests death for me he also took the penalty of sin for me he also took the judgment for me all of that are in your hamburger you don't want to pick up fine i see you in the resurrection let's go to verse 15 and deliver them who drew fear of water so death has a fear you gather bj you got it okay who drew fear of water of death where all their lifetimes subject to water so there was somebody who had made humanity suffer and keep everybody under bondage everybody you can fight this you can fight this you can fight the when that person come everybody shake his name is water are people still dying today so not all things are put under yet all things are put under christ because he is the resurrection and the life yet lazarus can die but when are we going to reach a point where nobody dies you ready now let's pray heavenly father lord we thank you again for your grace your love your mercy and for everything you have been doing for us father we are committing this service unto the hand i did all that i can do as a human being father i'm surrendering myself and i ask that's the holy spirit help me surrender completely and move me completely out of the way so that you can speak to your children father seal every demonic spirit away from this place and lord father away from your children where they are streaming lord and may only the holy spirit and the angel of the lord father minister to your children lord you spoke to us that the gentile faith is not lord father resting on laying on hand may everywhere somebody's watching may father you touch and minister to their life we aimly ask it lord father in the name of jesus christ amen all right the second banquet of esther we're going up we finish with king ahazarys the second banquet of esther part one the mystery of water praise god you ready when we talk about the black dog we found out that the origin of the black dog came from the indian chief embark here and we gave you three scenario that when we are born in this world we have the inward man or the inside man and the outside man or the body or the physical man and when we are born the way we are born we born in sin we are shaping iniquity coming into this world we don't have to be taught lie we speaking lies everybody clear and we explain to you that both your inside and your outside according to romans 7 have a black dog in it anybody clear all right then when we moved to the second scenario we found out that the black dog was still there everybody clear but the black dog was no longer inside and what changed you or what takes you from the first step all the way to the second step is the coming down of the dove anybody clear when the dove comes when the gospel the living christ come in your life he approaches you on the east side everybody when he approaches when he approaches you on the inside your soul is still death because your soul already sinned and the bible said that the soul that sinners shall do what should i ever care so when the holy spirit come he's gonna kiss your soul and when he make a contact with your soul he's gonna remove everything that was dark over there this is what we call the new birth are we clear then the holy spirit will enter inside there and when he enter then he become a white dog ever here no your inside is the white dog but your outside is a black dog that is the indian chief problem because he was born again brother branham said what's going on with you chief he said oh prophet since i was born again there is a fight not outside of me everybody there is a fight inside of me and paul explained to us that fact in romans 7 he said when i want to do good i found out that evil is present evil is present within me so there is a wrestling a fight that is going on between you and you ever care so far the black dog that is still on your flesh is trying to pull you backward toward egypt but this one that came on the inside has a purpose to pull you all the way to full redemption where the inside and the outside is completely free over here everything will be put in subjection of you not crushed you ever clear now we found out that in this second scenario the black dog is still there yet on the inside christ is living with you in john chapter 14 verse 23 the bible says that jesus answered and said unto him if a man loves me he will keep my word and my father will love him and we will come unto him and make our water our board with him in other words my father and me which are one we're going to come and make you our dwelling place and a bird is a house a dwelling place ever clear so when you love christ then you receive his word god is coming into you enter in your heart and you become the temple of god everybody clear in revelation chapter 3 verse 20 the bible says behold i stand at the door and do whatever who's knocking christ if any man hears my voice this is in laodicea and open the door i will come into him so there is an entrance in and will do what so there is a supper that is going to happen in you come here there is a banquet in you ever here there is a supper that happened in you when you opened your door which is your free moral agency you have the right to say yes or no to god but if you are predestinated god will give you the love of the truth so when you see the truth automatically or door open like the door of walmart pup wide open and then christ enter when he's entering in he's bringing a banquet not a banquet to your friend not a banquet with your neighbor not a banquet with your pastor or your deacon but a banquet for you i will come in him and will sup with him and he with me there is a communion brother but i'm saying the message leadership he says god is calling whom not a church ever here individual in spoken word tabernacle here i stand at the door and knock if any man any person how many individuals one individual out of a thousand it might be one out of water so god is coming individually to you and he has he's entering in so he can have a banquet with you ever clear the door inside the door brother branham said lord i stand at the door and knock and if you shall open the door i will come into you and will sap with you sup with him and him with me sup means to do what to entertain to have fellowship sap one with the other it's to have water communion fellowship one with another so we found out by these verses here and this quote that the coming of the white dog inside of you is a coming into a banquet [Music] are you following me yet in that banquet you still have the black dog hey god came into you by the new birth to have communion with you to have fellowship with you inside of you but a one god is having communion with you there is also somebody there everybody here that's why esther have to invite airmen so on the first banquet a man is present he's happy he's alive he's disturbing paul until paul said all right said that i am who can rescue me for this body of water because somebody a visitor is there we don't want him amen esther knew that the one who's causing all the trouble his name is heaven but yet a man must be invited because in your body when you have communion which is with the king sin he also is over there ever here if he's coming in he's bringing his coming inside what is he coming for brother of adam said in the very day that the son of man is revealed now remember the first banquet of esther happened in esther chapter 5. you remember that and in esther chapter 6 which is the number of a man about here that's when mordecai revealed the son of man to the public and then in esther chapter seven ever here this is when we have the second penguin the mathematics of the bible america the book of esther is like a book of revelation america in chapter 5 there is a first banquet in chapter 6 there is a revealing of the king to the public by mordecai in chapter 7 there is the second banquet in chapter 5 amen is good everybody in chapter seven emmen is in trouble in chapter five emen is still powerful in chapter seven emen is powerless about here so when the king come into you to sup with you there is a black dog standing right there amen but before you move from the first banquet all the way to the second banquet there must be a a a a space where the son of man must be revealed the revelation of the son of man have a purpose for your banquet hallelujah brother branham say in the very day that the son of man is revealed we found the king stay in the palace and monica took the robe of the king the crown of the king even the horse of the king until when you look at modica you will think it's the king are you there that's why brother branham was riding the horse of jesus and when you look at him from afar you think it's the king you must get on the detail in order to detect and to separate mordecai with the king if not you're going to get confusion because john got that confusion in the book of revelation until john begin to worship mordechai [Music] people trying to worship brother branham is it a problem it's in the scripture we don't worship brother branham we know who do we worship because we got the ego vision it is to the unbeliever to stumble but to me it's glorious when i see a man turning his back and doing this it's telling me genesis 18 god revealing human flesh hallelujah i told you i am soaring up toward the surface so you better stay up amen in the day when the son of man is with you revelation water one to water read it when you get home the seventh angel's message opening up water so in between where esther chapter 5 which is the chapter of grace because grace brought you the gift of faith for you to be saved ever clear then arrested chapter 6 the revelation of a man the son of man and exodus chapter 7 which is going to be the completion of your redemption ever clear so in between step five and esther seven they must reveal the seals what for hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord the seventh century message opening up the water what is it not the engine is the water but the messenger is revealing the water mother kai is not the king mordecai is only resilient the king the king was in the palace you never seen his horse before you never seen his crown before you never seen his clothing before somebody went and stripped the king strip the king off his power strip the king of his crown until the fullness of the king was outside what remained in the palace was the body but the fullness of the king was outsider and he was carried by somebody else the king anointing was on someone yes sir is everybody awake are we okay are we good did i lose someone thank you back on up good i'm come i'm keep coming out everybody this you don't get into this anymore you must believe the message of the hour what is it not the angel is the son of man but the messenger is revealing the son of man can you get it water that is where it seems to be water it's not easy you see not the son of man himself the king but the seventh angel mordecai the seventh messenger modica is revealing to the water it's mordecai he's going who's going on the city and when you see more the car you say oh now i see how the king's crown looked like [Applause] i never had a pair i never had a chance to get in the palace now i can see the king robert i'm gonna drop it when the king won his apparel when the president is operating when the president is passing through here either to jump back and passing here nobody will be allowed to be on the highway do you follow me everybody will be locked out 85 will be closed because the president is going up you have no right to approach the president because there is security all around him but when it's mordecai are you there monica give you a privilege to approach and touch the king government are you there when you see more the car there is no king security around mother kind you can approach mordechai and hug him and smell the king perfume [Applause] are you there that's why when mordecai was preaching he said somebody touch him are you there you are touching the high priest but it's more the guy who's answering you and telling you your sickness your problem your trouble it is the presence of mordecai ministry that bring the king to you [Music] [Applause] that's why under the discernment brother branham was saying you touch him you touch somebody i see him over there i see that light moving over there you just touch him and i'm telling you your name is so-and-so you come from so and so and you did so so mother god gives you opportunity to touch the king government are you there the gentiles never have that opportunity it takes monica to bring the king outside [Applause] i don't know if i'm going to reach where i'm going do you have enough teeth to chew if you don't have it see me i'm going to give you dentures hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord he said not the son of man himself but the seven angel the seven messenger is revealing to the water the water because he left the water he can organize it it's the water grain itself again what happened upon sunset mountain god confirming his water that is what all this noise is about not is it god fulfilling his water again of revelation one to water in the days of the sounding of the seven angel message the mystery of god should be water the hidden water of revelation ten one two one the last message to the last fulfilling exactly in this edge psalm luke 17 30 the day when the son of man shall be welcomed so the coming of the son of man to the public is to unfold the mysteries why do you need the mysteries for it hallelujah why do you need the mysteries for it hallelujah brother branham says this he said oh i stand it god bless you up there in the balcony i stand at the door and knock god bless you young man sitting down sitting down here just as the crossroads at the crossroads of life i stand at the door and knock if any man will hear my voice and will come open the door i will come and i will do water and we found out that that sapping is bringing the banquet what is the purpose of the sapping that supper amen i will sup with him sat down at the water i shall just make all the water so the purpose of christ coming in the first banquet of your life amen and then allowing chapter 6 before 7 is to unfold the mystery to you is to open the world radically what is the purpose of god opening the world now [Music] america on the first banquet you already invite him you die to yourself but there is a second death anybody clear unfold and i shall just make all my ministry of all my mysteries known to him why do you want to make your mysteries known to me why what is the purpose you're already living in me you're already in me we are communing we have fellowship we are talking one another why do you want to reveal your mysteries to me why do you want to bring me let the disciple in the road of emails and put me in that little chamber and you breaking the bread what is the purpose of breaking the bread are you there so is the church of the living god that has been water bombed down in the water middle of water and water a man is raging in the pentecostal world under the first banquet first banquet to the church pentecostal first banquet to you a special supper the church laodicea pentecosta the terror and the witch together and the church as an individual you with the black dog a man in the edge and aiming in you are we clear now but she is warmed up her way brother kelly through the grim until she's on the top of the thing now in other words that church was growing growing growing until she comes out are you there spreading forth water for water so there is a church that has been coming out brother kelly that church was born by the rabbit and begin to grow grow and brother branham say the church reach a point where she begin to spread her wings why do you want to spread your wings because there is a water a flight coming up a flight to meet who jesus way are you there many shall run to and four and the people that do what know that god shall do whatever in there [Music] god revelation to his water set still little flock positionally stay where you are our sister gertie and sister angie used to sing here keep doing water don't take a flight yet you don't want to go with that black dog hey mark here don't worry god is waiting and trying and pressing to get at the mystery of god water reveal to his water why do you want to reveal the mysteries are we there reveal to his church that is what is holding back the water so you cannot have the coming of christ without the revelation of the mysteries it is the revelation of the mysteries that preparing you for the second coming do you follow me you cannot jump from chapter five all the way to chapter seven you need to go to chapter 6 where the son of man unfold his mystery to you and the purpose of those mysteries is to prepare you for the flight [Music] that is what is holding on the coming of christ now and the great water brother branham said when the seven seals unfold it's unfolding all the way to the ushering in of the water millennium christ now the great millennium is this great supernatural power that really lays hell in the water so when we go back to our picture here there is somebody in your banquet and that person is comfortable are you there so god does not stop at your

to a water now there is power of revelation of the water the word gives stimulation of joy to the believer stimulation of water and the stimulation that is vindicated and it's what proven so when god comes under banquet in between there's five between the fifth and the seventh verse and begin to unfold the word to you he's stimulating you he's bringing power you begin to be satisfied no matter

food that can take them from any all the way to sea when they come tired they go home happy they come without hope they go home full of hope they come sick they go home healed because jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever hallelujah my god he's affording the mysteries why not only is he giving you a breath but god is unfolding his mystery why is he upholding his mysteries he begins to give you power in other words he begin to make the white dog grow and the white dog grown and the white dog grows and the more the white dog grows the more you are squeezing the black dog [Applause] hallelujah those mysteries will bring you into the second banquet and give you power of heaven do you follow me dan if you notice the indian chief was not a young man a chief engine is not a knight a youth he's another man amen the fight that will kick him and out of your body out of your banquet will change you into a young man are you there are you there in your first banquet christ is there but you can still get sick you are still growing up you are still having gray hair yo so they are stooping down you need something reveal you need chapter six to prepare you for the change so in the change of revelation of chapter seven you're gonna complete your banquet and get a man out then you bringing to the place where redemption is in completeness when it's in completeness the youth renew again [Music] anybody clear so far let's take esther chapter three oh my god your time is going up esther chapter 3 the mystery of death let me see if i can hurry up chapter two if you dare you can say amen a few people verse four we know that airmen was the right-hand man of the king which we already explained to you that was who lucifer all right verse 4 now he came to pass when they spoke daily with him he hearken not to them that they told him to see whether mordecai's mother action will stain for health told them that he was a water mordecai never gave them the law of moses are you there are you there herman his action his life was the law made flesh amen are we following me are you following me as long as the law was in the bookshelf of heaven of mordecai heaven was fine are we there as long as your bible stay at home the devil is okay as long as the tape stays in your iphone the devil is okay are you there as long as the message stay on your computer the devil is okay because the law was brought by a prophet moses what trouble a man is when the world leaves the self and the word get in the person and the world became get fit and choose and clothe and the world begin to walk that is what trouble amen hallelujah brother branham say all right here was water and how we need in jeffersonville in gastonia in spoken word tabernacle thousands of water the water the thunder of god thundering out in sweetness and holiness and purity and default water walking around in the earth today without water yes sir real water that is the thunder against the enemy what trouble amen is to see a jew leaving his religion because when the jew leaves his religion he become a resistance to emmanuel [Music] dominion when he comes everybody must bow down and for you to resist airmen you gotta take the law off the pages and put it in your life and you and the law become one and your life becomes the law the devil wakes up the devil don't care how loud you can holler the devil don't care how much you can jump how much you can do this or shout but what hurts the devil is to see water a sanctified holy life consecrated to god say anything to him call him anything just as sweet as he can be and move right on oh my god throw him away that is the water that shake who if you want to check the devil the message must be made flesh in your life [Music] hallelujah hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord satan brother kelly doesn't care how religious you are oh how right you are in your what that's what the faces were in the message [Music] are you there we first to see who got the right doctrine amen and brother branham said satan doesn't care about them continue to fast continue to kill each other satan doesn't care about them if you miss water that life you won't come up if you miss that life you won't enter to the second banquet [Music] are you there you won't come up anyhow no matter how religious how good how many churches you belong to or will belong to it does not matter one thing unless you have been water you must go to chapter five the first banquet before you are a candidate to the second banquet we skip like afrahim the new birth and we put the mysteries on a regenerated heart somebody who is not born again but his head is filled with mysteries it doesn't help you you won't come up because you miss the life you miss the step you miss the first supper you can get an intellectual knowledge but the the reason of the first supper is to bring the holy ghost in you and the holy ghost is the inside teacher so when you begin to listen to the word to the message the holy spirit in you begin to teach you how to live a christian life [Music] because the holy ghost feeds on though and when you bring in mysteries he begins to grow anybody clear the greatest marker of villain in that age in the world that we ever lived is a false light in this hour that we're living in trying to put us back under some kind of creed and things when we are living water or in other words we are a piece of that that is living that has been written and now living out the water as he promised in the hour manifested word a piece of written that has been living that is what their pastor was so the apostles were not people that were just coding the word because they were not intellectual but there were people that were living the gospel until if you don't have the message if you watch them you can understand the message everybody clear so far blessed be the name of the young brother problem say i am identified with a group that knows he's unveiled that knows he's the same yesterday today and forever that knows this is not fanaticism it is jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever i'm identify with that group tonight yet they are called a bunch of heretics yet a bunch of fanaticism on the count of the world but i'm not ashamed of the gospel of jesus christ for it's the power unto salvation i am one i am with them leaving epistle i spoke of vindicated god well in water in water you become the living world we are not come together to talk about the message we are come together to do whatever get in this happen and the message is who he is there we are to get into it get beneath it yes sir that is what we are supposed to do amen that is the thunder that's going to destroy emen he hates that you can do everything as long as you miss the life let's go to verse 8. hallelujah hallelujah jump to verse 13. i'm sorry go back to verse 8. and heaven said to the king of hazaris there is a certain people scattered abroad and dispersed among the people in all the provinces of your kingdom and the laws how did he know the laws did he read them do you think him and stop on the computer to do research on crazy website endeavors from all the people neither keep that the king's law therefore it is not for the king's prophet to allow them if you notice here him and purpose in his heart to destroy mordecai and all the jews and we already show you that the jew in the new testament paul said that the jew is the one that is what in word the one that is already in chapter five this is the jew but here but even though you are jew already living the world the threat of heaven is still there are you following me amen is not solved even though you were jew by birth everybody so he purposed to destroy them but if you notice he cannot destroy them without the permission of the king [Music] the power of heaven is always under permission to the jews or to the believer we're going somewhere jump to verse 30 now keep that in mind you ready we jump to verse 13. and the letter let me get 12. then were the king's water who wrote the letter hammond had a plot amen he had the plan he had a ministry that he wanted to fulfill his plan his purpose his ministry is to destroy everybody that is jew anybody clear but in order to do that number one he needs a permission from the king anybody when he get permission from the king his plan his purpose must be written by a scrub are you following me you got that then were the king scrub call on the 13th day of the first man and they were written according to all that the king had commanded you need to watch your scripture who's riding heaven all that heaven has commanded to the king lieutenant and to the governor that were on every provinces the power of amen was said in the political realm are you following me he got a plan one he needs permission two he need the scrabble three his power is control on the political world are we okay i told you i'm sorry of every province according to the writing thereof and to every people after the water it's a universal power to all the universal politics are we okay anybody clear in the name of king water the letter is written under the king's name but it is not the purpose of the kingdom you follow me the purpose is the purpose of heaven but if you look it looks like it's the king and it's written by a scrabble and invade the politics anybody he was written and sealed with the king water it is a purpose that is a purpose from lucifer that purpose is written brother robert by a scrub and it's written under the king's name but that purpose is also sealed with the king seal and if it's still somebody need to break the seal to decode it [Music] verse 13 and the letter was sent by water post let's stop there go to keep your finger right there go to esther chapter eight they are send by post go to esther chapter eight if you dare you can say amen hallelujah you there go to verse 10 and he wrote in the king of hazard's name and seal it with the king's water and send leather by water on what come out and and let's go back to verse three chapter three the purpose is heaven purpose amen have a plan he want to fulfill number one permission from the king number two he must be written by a scrub number three he must be sealed number three he must be carried on a horse we have three elements here we have a message of heaven and that message is a sealed message written by a scrub and carried on a horse it is a ministry that comes like it's god but it's not god it is the antichrist it must be written by a scribe by the name of john john must be the one writing what he sees and when john sees he sees a rose heard a rose a horse right there coming up a cavalier and the cavalier carried a message a message with the plan of the enemy still with the king seal in order to destroy so you need a mordekai to take that message and decode it everybody clear so far [Laughter] i'm not in the deep portion i told you i'm sorry let's go to verse 13. and the letter was sent by goldberg post on a beast into all the king's provinces to do water destroy come out kill to cause to perish still kill all the jews both young and old little children and women in one day upon the 13th day of the 12th month 12 12 13 12 which is the month of adam and to take the water somebody want to steal so we found out that that message has three purpose to kill destroy to kill or to cause to perish and to do what to steal john chapter 10 verse 10 the bible said the fifth cometh not but to do water and to do what and to do what but i am calm that they might have water this is the black dog this is a white dog and that they might have more water not only does he want you to have life chapter five but he wants you to have life abundantly chapter seven he wants you to have pro complete life everybody so far so we found out here go to esther chapter four verse seven then i'm gonna sort straight and go to the airport if possible exeter chapter seven you there all right chapter four verse seven and mordecai told him oh that had happened to him and the sum of money that human head remember that was not written right it was not written but it was part of the story he have to be unfolded by mordecai that's the thunder that are written in between you can read the letter all along you will never know about the 30 pieces but mordecai must be there to know what happened to tell you if you chase him by the ladder you won't find it because it's a tangle where is he written in the bible where is he written in the bible you won't find it like that it's connected to the bible but it has been hidden when you read the king is saying we need to destroy you take that same bible you give to mordechai he look heaven is behind this he's trying to destroy you and he have given the king so many pieces of silver what kind of bible are you reading let me see the king is trying to destroy modica do you need glasses get glasses mordecai get grasses heaven is trying to destroy he's trying to destroy the king and this is what he's trying to do the bible become a new same same letter different view based on who is interpreting it [Music] if you want to know the true concept you must go to mordechai because he is the one that can give you the living letter and the written the logos and the rhema he gives you both of them because he is the one that can afford the seal and tell you the road that you see coming up there it's death his message is the message of heaven wait you're gonna see and you see somebody standing the king is saying we're going to kill all the jews he said what did i tell you it is not the king he's on the white horse he's an impersonator verse 7 and the sum of money that hammond promised to pay the king's treasures also he gave him the copy of the riding of the decree let me drop this to save time verse 11 and oh this is 10 again esther spoke to attack heter and gave him commandment to modica all the king servant and the people of the king's provinces do know that whosoever whether man or woman shall go to the king into the inner court we already explained you this who is not called you must be a leaver to go in the body of holies there is only water one law the law of moses of him to be put to water so we found out here that esther even though she was chosen everybody here she was subject to a death death to approach the king enter inner chamber amen that's why ephraim was afraid he doesn't want to come out but mordecai say you must cross that death if you don't overcome the first death that block you to access the king you will not be able to overcome the death by heaven everybody the power to overcome the second deaths you must overcome the first death first you must die to yourself first if you want to die kill heaven so we found that it's death to enter in the king's presence and it's also death that is coming from the enemy heaven to death ephraim is afraid of both of them ephraim doesn't want to get into the presence of the king he doesn't want to be born and yet there is another death that is waiting on him esther broke into the first death we know that happened by the problem saying the bible say the soul that sinneth he shall die the word death means water in other words the soul that disbelief the word of god shall finally separate from you now death if i die now or any water christian would die it would not be separation from god because he died here with my word and believe on him that sent me has everlasting life but you will be separated from one another it's just a separation brother problem is saying here when you are a christian when you are born again when you are already here on the first banquet the death to the soul doesn't do anything to you yet somebody is not under jurisdiction yet it's heaven how do we get him off are we there praise be the name of the lord when god created adam in the garden of eden we go downtown it's just when you saw in this avenue like you in eternity amen when death when adam was created actually in the garden of eden adam was not created as a baby adam was created by children after sin was entered to the human race then men begin to be born by a woman and job says that a man born of a woman his days are water very few and full of water why because death entering in now we are growing we are growing we are growing we are growing we are strong after a while we begin to wake up in the morning we have backache ever clear so when you look at this chart roman says for the earnest expectation of the creature whether for the manifestation of the son of god for the creature was made subject to vanity not willingly but by reason of him who has subjected the same in hope remember the word put on the suggestion paul is saying here that when man fell man was given the jurisdiction of the earth when he fell by sin paul is saying that nature also fell by default not that nature sin but because nature was under man automatically nature fell paul continued he said because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of water corruption into the glorious liberty of the children of god paul says that just as christ is coming to save you to rescue you and to bring you back again to eden god will not only save men but god will also save the creation that fell on the man that's why you repent you get baptized justification sanctification baptism of the holy ghost that's the reason why the earth also go through the same process brother branham said through the water of noah it was the baptism when jesus died on the cross he shed his blood now there is fire coming up because the creation also shall be delivered just like you not only are you wanting the black dog to be kicked out nature also doesn't like the black dog let me help you up there was a man by the name of legion you got it now you got it now did you get it yeah you want me to explain legion was a normal man he was living fine and some because of his lifestyle demon came and began to live with him he could not take it he went all the way and begin to live in the grave until when he heard that jesus christ was coming legion ran quickly he said i suffered this for so long please come and deliver me from devils you cannot be comfortable with demon in you you are not meant to live with devils you cannot condone with evil spirit you cannot be pleasing on pornography that is not correct are you there when jesus when legion so crushed he says this is my deliverance son of man son of man the people say keep your mouth shut he said son of david son of david why it is my deliverance i need to get this blindness out of me are you there god said fine i'm gonna remove the devils the devil said please we don't just want to go in the air help us fund creation we got it now we need a creation that is not human that we're gonna get there the devil did not understand that even creation is crying for him god said where do you want to go they say to the people he said go when they put the devil in the pig the pig committed suicide are you that because creation also doesn't like the black dog you don't like the black dog the tree doesn't like the black dog the three wanna live eternally the pig wanna live in peace the dog wanna live in peace the birds wanna live in peace you are starting to be living in peace [Music] hallelujah that's what paul is saying here oh my god for we know that the whole water is growing and traveling for water that's why the pig don't want the pig say i was living here peacefully that crazy man was the one that was the house god if you don't wear his water let me choke myself when i die he's not gonna live in a dead body my spirit will be taken back to the savior let them go outside of me [Music] you want to live with devils when pig you don't want the devils pig doesn't even have a soul but creation is refusing [Music] hallelujah when they were crucifying jesus christ when everybody was watching jesus christ naked the son said no i cannot see him naked turn the light off switch the rock begin to shake because creation speaks hallelujah not only day creation but our self also which have the water which are already in chapter 5 on the first banquet we are also groaning esther was there fellowshipping with the king and maybe he give the king a girl a cup of drink maybe some sparkling red juice and the king drinking he said honey can i have some apple as the ghost to get the apple when she goes back there she said this airman this look how he's even smiling when he come she's groaning because a man is there hallelujah even we ourself grown within ourself waiting for the water i still wanted a position that she can kick a man out are you there the adoption to wait the redemption of water because that's where haman is hitting him he's the one that make your hair turn green are you there are you there so we found the pyramid here as we grow everything is fun you strong built muscle six-pack everything is there you can get hit on uh on the stone you fell you get wounded they put some alcohol you go ahead and start running again on basketball try that at 40 years old you're going to find it hurt all the way to the heart i when you're a kid he hurts here he doesn't hurt to the heart mama go ahead go ahead quickly i need to go the finish put a band-aid whopper you back again to the ground because you're still strong are you there grow up a little bit if he hurt it really hurt you're going to put band-aid and all kind of stuff and you're like i need few days to recuperate because your cartilage are not the youth one are you there when they rob each other it hurts are you there so when you reach another edge then suddenly you begin to stoop down the point today of changing is brought by oh my god your time the the point there of changing the point of changing that was really quick wow wow want to go to the airport not yet the devil are you there the point there is brought by the horse which is bringing death the mystery of death what is death you ready now back up and i'm gonna head in exodus 12 verse 23 the bible says for the lord will pass through to do what if you read that who's gonna kill the egyptian correct it's god killing the egyptian and when he sees the blood upon the lentil who sees the blood brother branham say he was the deaf angel the bible says the lord continue and on that two side post their who will pass water so who's trying to kill who's passing over let's see really i will pass over the door and will not suffer the water who was trying to kill with the permission of who everybody here so when god is coming he's going with the destroyer are you there under permission are you there this door not this one this one go ahead yes sir not the lord the destroyer get there and struck jesus what is death we found that according to exodus chapter 13 can i get this there is somebody who's accompanying god his name is the destroyer hallelujah amen first corinthians chapter 10 verse 10 neither murmur year as some of them also murmur and where destroy of the water the same person psalm 78 verse 49 he cast upon them the fairness of his anger rough and indignation and trouble by sending water so david explained to us that this destroyer that destroyed the children of god was an evil angel who is deaf are you there hang on hallelujah first corinthians 15 for cease by man came what adam by men also came the water jesus of the water i am the resurrection and water life so as in adam all did water even so in who shall be all be known water if we were represented by death in the first adam we are also represented by life in the second adam are you there it's a sandwich are you there the last enemy that shall be destroyed so death is an enemy death is a destroyer death is an evil angel death is an enemy and he'll be the last one to be destroyed i'm going with death are we okay you tired hallelujah hebrew two for as much then as the children are partaking of flesh and blood because we the children of god we were born with this flesh come on he also jesus christ himself likewise took part of the same in other words god also said my children are body are made in the body of flesh i'm going to make myself also a body of flesh to be like them he came in the body called jesus jesus is god that what is the purpose that through death anybody he might destroy him the head the water that is there so this angel death is a power everybody clear death is a destroyer called the death angel he's an evil angel he's an enemy he's a power controlled by the devil because he is the one that have the power of water control or under the jurisdiction everybody of the devil or satan anybody to destroy satan that had the power of water that is who the devil is hallelujah brother branham see where our wrestle is today see what the deaf angel is now you understand why brother branham is calling him deaf angel he never gave you a scripture what the death angel is it's a spiritual water wickedness in high places great places big places ever clear for the sake of time but on his road up here i imagine there was a decision when the devil looked down death you want to kill christ he said if that is life then i'm wrong but if it's not life i shall sting him when the devil was looking at jesus christ i shall kill him down there at the cross and at the conference in hell the devil's angel was sent forth the angel of water so death is a destroyer death is an angel an evil angel death is an enemy death is a spiritual power under the jurisdiction of satan everybody clear hallelujah revelation 6 verse 8 when he opened the fourth seal i heard the voice of the four beasts come and see say come and see and i look and behold a water a pelvis his name that sat on him was water death and water ephraim i'm gonna wrestle you i'm gonna rest from you and i will be a plug to death and to who the grave hell this is not the hell that the other people go not to me everybody his name that sat on him was death and he'll follow him and power was given unto him in other words they took that angel and gave him in jurisdiction because barbara branham said that man was satan and satan had the power of what death they gave him again the jurisdiction go ahead and do it power was given over him over the fourth part of the earth to do what with water and water he's killing with the sword is killing with water or feminine and then he's killing with what how can you kill with death and with the water i told you the beasts of the earth don't like the devil right what is going on who is them all right antichrist call who help followed him which watched his fourth point scheme anticlass the white horse killed by water being antichrist spiritual water is killing by death check you want horseradish number two red horse killed by water check host red horse heart political power remember the power of a man goes to politics when church and state united black horse shows when he give out his doctrine and she did there with her fornication and he weigh out their what hunger what they give for food for a balance and the pennies third as the six year old the third seal this is water by fall second seal by hunger third seal spiritual death antichrist white horse rather over there everybody clear the penthouse got the three horses mixed together brother branham spoke it and you saw it where it's coming from now when the lion was first created because he killed by the beast of the earth he was a friend of man it's the endeavor that make him do that in the millennium the wolf and the lamb shall feed together the lions are eat strong normal stake like the bullock and shall lay down in the bullock they shall not hurt or destroy in the millennium the devil will be gone it's the devil that make the world be stale and reap and eat and things like that the way they do it's certain that does that they also want to be free from satan because at the beginning the lion was eating grass now you put him on the stake meat lover but greater was he that was in daniel then he that was in the lion see greater was he in the prophet than he that was in the lion it's too power hey but here don't worry we're heading quick now he was he has a name called death none of the other radio or none of the other horses or no one term that this rather ever wrote they didn't have that man had no name but now he's called death it's not mentioned he is revealed now what he is death now we could linger on that for a sermon and make a real plan but anything that is entire that is against the will has to be because that is on there is only two subjects life and water the entire he is death because the word as we shall see later is what watch now but he was 68 million put to death to protest the first roman church rome wonder he could impersonate himself in the personified name called death the devil impersonate himself in death but death is not the devil relax now god only knows how many he caused spiritually to die to spiritually die by his anti-bible word teaching this is one he put this this is the one he put 68 million to the sword and killed him and probably literally billion dies spiritually on his false teaching no wonder he could take the name of what brother branham said he could take the name he was not deaf revelation 20. take that and then i'll go to the airport revelation 20. what is the mystery of death revelation 20 verse 7 the devil is not death the devil have power over death but death and the devil are separated even though the is called death it's a tado higa because he's killing revelation 20 verse 7. and when the thousand years are expired who the devil shall be lose out of his prison anybody clear job to verse 10 and there satan that deceived them was cast into the lake of water who is casting the lake of fire satan jumped to verse 14 and and were cast into the water so there will be a time the devil himself will because then death end so death and hell and the devil are separated are you there this angel the destroyer the deaf angel the evil angel the enemy the power always work with hell anybody care i just want you to see that fear not i am he that was he that is and welcome i'm the first and last i have the keys of hell and what not the keys of satan not certain why i have overcome and conquered both water and that is buffed and death itself had this itself hell always follow death in the natural when natural man dies hell follows him that is the water the grave hades and uh see that's in the natural but in the spiritual it's the lack of water all right it's into eternal separation i'm gonna explain that later keep that down so we understand that death is followed by hell hell another name is called the hades that's why paul could say oh death where is your sting oh where is your victory death this angel called death called the destroyer the evil angel the enemy the spiritual power is the highest level i'm almost going to the airport he is the highest level that satan can reach are you there the highest level satan can achieve in your life is to kill you once he kill you there is no more bullet for the devil the devil can torment you torment you torment you block you here block you there but his top weapon is death that is the end of satan's dominion his domain can only come that far to the river and his power is cut off it is that satan has the power of what the jurisdiction but thank be to the living god who has the power of water beyond the shadow of water what a marvelous thing the devil assured fellow all right and he carried the power of death within him with him but that is all the father he can go his death but then we found out that faith stepping them at the death then faith step in and recognize a god of resurrection are you there so where the devil stop god start hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord so the devil usually start that little flare and so watch it he tried to cut off the move of god every time he will do that and he shall still and he is still the same devil use the same technique that he did in the old days he still uses them today we could only read the old testament then we learn the tactics of the devil how he does so we found out that his power he had power and that power was death but he had no power beyond that just death ends his power then beyond death faith sees the god of resurrection after the devil's end of power of death then his water the devil can do no more that's why paul say i want to know him in the power of his water i just don't want to know him but i want to know him in the power of his resurrection because the resurrection is beyond death [Music] everybody hallelujah even though the devil have the jurisdiction of death but the one who's the boss is god i hope you're getting what i'm trying to get to you today in the book of job and the lord said unto satan behold all that he has is in that power only upon water put not forth his water death cannot touch the believer only under the permission of god heaven cannot operate if the king doesn't give him permission no matter how much death can come close to you you can look at his face and say you're not gonna touch me except you receive power from one eye are you there balance god jesus he said i have power to burn you and power to release you jesus look at him he said you have no power on me except it is giving you from above you can do nothing if the boss have not decided are you there no matter what the doctor say no matter what the physician say no matter what the cardiologist say they will do nothing unless the boss decided i don't care what the doctor said i don't care what the statistics say i don't care what the machine says god is they decided [Applause] hallelujah we give too much credit to the devil hallelujah show me the machine show me the glitters show me the lab tester don't care lazarus died and

remember that part i am the one who decided you can put sickness in job go ahead do it but remember that part i would decide on job not you hallelujah and david anger was kindled against the man and said to nathan as the lord leaveth the man that has done these things actually what who pronounced judgment [Music] the devil took that confession and said look your sons say he's worthy to die now i need permission to kill david he confess it even in your stupid mistake the devil have no power [Applause] even if i made a mistake and i'm pressurized and i say something negative still the boss have the right to say hallelujah and david said unto nathan i have sinned against the lord and let them say unto david the prophet the lord has put away that sin that shall not work i thought satan even though he didn't stop him don't touch david hallelujah first samuel chapter 25 joab sent the woman to talk to the king and david dijon and called him he said the job is behind you she said yes my lord it's joy but send me the women say yet a man is reason to pursue thee and seek their soul but the soul of my lord shall be bound in the bundle of life with water and the soul of the enemies them shall he sling out out of the midst of the swing if it's somebody that hates you god say do it what you want to do if it's you i am the original owner you don't touch them brother branham said we do not want to be mistaken satan has power and that power is death he has power of death satan is the one who takes your life [Music] do you want to continue with me satan is the one who takes your life when god will let him water he cannot take your life if god have not decided even if they put you or not see you even if you're in the camera but god can hold your life and satan cannot take it until god let him do it he can only use that power as god we let him use it isn't that wonderful he said god harness death up into a water a baggie and the only thing death can do is put a believer in the presence of his mecca that's why david said precious is in the sight of the lord the death of the center but that said won't die if god have not decided are you there oh my god blessed be the name of the lord amen no matter how much we cry and think this that or the other nothing can take us until god is finished with us hallelujah i am so glad to know that if god have a mission in this earth and
