[24:54] the lord it's nothing but but your enemy
[24:56] and our enemy that that has attacked

[46:05] everybody happy tonight
[46:07] I know it's Wednesday you've been at
[46:09] work
[46:10] tired but it's a sacrifice unto the Lord
[46:14] amen
[46:15] glory to God glory to God we continue to
[46:20] remember Brother Rich in prayer I spoke
[46:22] to him today he's doing well he was uh
[46:25] he went to our surgery for gallbladder
[46:27] so by God's grace he's a home just going
[46:30] through pain post-op pan so he's taking
[46:33] medication it's helping but he told me
[46:35] to mention he greet you all he said
[46:37] mention to the church to continue to
[46:39] remember me in prayer for fast recovery
[46:41] you need to say it down not driving for
[46:44] so many days not lifting weight so many
[46:46] days until gradually you get here oh man
[46:49] but so far he's doing wonderful amen
[46:52] everything is okay everything is under
[46:54] control you do what the Nightingale is
[46:57] supposed to
[47:00] amen glory to God you continue to read
[47:04] the book of Daniel it's a very
[47:07] complicated book if the holy spirit is
[47:11] not gracious to you especially if we
[47:14] didn't have a prophet it could have been
[47:16] hard but thank God for the prophet and
[47:19] thank God for the second oil I try I
[47:22] mentioned about the compound meaning on
[47:24] the
[47:25] seven heads
[47:27] you remember mentioned about seven heads
[47:29] being seven hills and another seven
[47:32] heads being seven Kings and he was not
[47:36] in the Book of Daniel but I saw it
[47:38] hidden somewhere so your boss opened up
[47:40] so continue to read I want you to keep
[47:43] getting the material if you don't read
[47:46] Daniel if we preach you'll be completely
[47:48] lost
[47:49] amen but if you read it two three times
[47:52] and you soak the material when we're
[47:54] going through it will be easier because
[47:56] the holy spirit will Quicken quickly
[47:58] Daniel it's like the Book of Revelation
[48:01] of the Old Testament
[48:03] amen so if you know what is in the Book
[48:06] of Revelation so many symbols that's
[48:09] exactly the way Daniel work amen it's a
[48:12] lot of symbols a lot of healing stuff
[48:15] and a lot of compound meaning there so
[48:18] continue to read even if you read you
[48:20] already finished go back again read it
[48:22] refresh your memory and we see how the
[48:25] Lord will help us on Sunday again how to
[48:28] take off but the airplane still the
[48:31] military one everybody okay
[48:33] so make sure you get some rest amen I am
[48:37] not preaching tonight even though I have
[48:39] the microphone on me I am actually
[48:41] translating we have a brother brother
[48:44] John mutoka but John mutoka is a head
[48:48] Deacon of one of the biggest Message
[48:50] Church in the world

[48:55] head Deacon for years and by God's grace
[48:57] he came to Kentucky visit his daughter

[49:19] great responsibility back home and we

[52:44] when we remember Calvary
[52:49] how you offered your only begotten son
[52:53] so that whom however can believe
[52:57] perish not
[52:59] but may he have everlasting classes
[53:05] and it's because of Calvary that we have
[53:09] the entire message
[53:11] Father we thank you for that
[53:15] father we need your anointing tonight
[53:18] [Music]

[55:28] so we thank God for that
[55:32] so let's go straight to the reading of
[55:35] the words
[55:37] I only have one passage of a scripture
[55:40] to read tonight
[55:41] and you well know it
[55:47] it's a Hebrew 13 8.
[55:52] Jesus Christ
[55:56] the same yesterday and today and forever
[56:03] may the Lord bless the reading of his
[56:05] word you might be seated
[56:09] amen
[56:12] Hallelujah
[56:13] I have to check my time
[56:17] event it's already 8 20.
[56:25] okay it's all right yes sir
[56:34] the brother the pastor told me you have
[56:37] an hour and 30 minutes but if the Lord
[56:39] permit maybe 30 minutes
[56:41] but uh I just believe um
[56:46] surrender myself to God if he take me to
[56:48] one hour 35.
[56:50] but I don't want to go beyond the time I
[56:53] love it amen amen
[56:57] my subject tonight is
[57:03] lifting him up out of History
[57:08] [Music]
[57:10] by the third pool
[57:16] [Music]
[57:22] inspiration this small revelation
[57:26] [Music]
[57:29] I can call it a small inspiration or a
[57:32] lot of exhortation tonight comma
[57:36] um
[57:42] like a lot of inspiration that I
[57:45] received from the Lord as I was making
[57:47] my way to North Carolina
[57:52] you see every step in my trip was a
[57:56] success
[58:05] to the point that I was witnessing the
[58:07] hand of the Lord in every step that I
[58:10] was going
[58:13] but at a certain time when I was
[58:15] meditating on my trip
[58:18] [Music]
[58:21] it was like a thought that was speaking
[58:24] Within Myself
[58:25] and that thought was repeating
[58:31] he came out of History
[58:38] now he's working with his people exactly
[58:44] like he did it for Paul
[58:49] a
[58:51] and that really caught me yes
[58:58] and I felt like I need to listen to that
[59:01] message because brother Brown and preach
[59:03] about it that precious
[59:08] I believe he was uh the October the 1st
[59:11] 1958
[59:15] and when I listened to that sermon
[59:17] lifting him out of History
[59:21] so I was so inspired
[59:25] for my own life
[59:34] and whenever I have a door open I will
[59:37] preach about it
[59:41] and that's the reason why tonight I will
[59:44] try to share with you that inspiration
[59:48] there is so many things we can talk
[59:50] about it
[59:53] but we will try to summarize
[59:59] and to give you a thought that can help
[1:00:01] each one of us tonight
[1:00:05] because we know that the message we
[1:00:08] receive is
[1:00:19] that's what was spoken to brother
[1:00:21] Branham at the river or Ohio
[1:00:31] the first coming of the Lord
[1:00:33] you also have a message
[1:00:36] to prepare
[1:00:39] the second coming of the Lord
[1:00:44] and most of the time we are led to
[1:00:47] destruction
[1:00:53] Sometimes women find ourselves arguing
[1:00:55] about it
[1:00:57] or uh quarreling about the message
[1:01:03] or still lasting after the world
[1:01:08] or doing things that are contrary to the
[1:01:11] world
[1:01:14] at that point we are not preparing
[1:01:17] ourselves
[1:01:20] and then we don't want to be
[1:01:22] disappointed
[1:01:26] so it's always good for us to stay awake
[1:01:30] to help one another
[1:01:34] with something that the Lord can give us
[1:01:37] as an inspiration
[1:01:41] just listen to this word at the
[1:01:44] beginning of this sermon lifting him out
[1:01:46] of History
[1:01:48] in paragraph one brother Branham says
[1:01:54] I'm just going to take what is necessary
[1:01:56] for the sake of time
[1:01:59] privilege I consider this to be a great
[1:02:03] privilege to remember this is Brother
[1:02:07] Brown I'm saying himself
[1:02:10] to be here at the Tabernacle tonight
[1:02:14] amen
[1:02:16] privilege and I believe that I deemed to
[1:02:19] be a great privilege myself
[1:02:22] because you are the Redeemer of the Lord
[1:02:27] because the Son of God shed his own
[1:02:30] blood for you
[1:02:32] so that this message
[1:02:38] somebody must shed his blood all
[1:02:41] throughout the ages
[1:02:45] we know that John the Baptist was killed
[1:02:48] he shared his word amen amen
[1:02:52] foreign
[1:03:23] [Applause]
[1:03:59] as we see his word unveiling itself day
[1:04:03] by day Reston prepared
[1:04:06] so we have to say as close as we can
[1:04:10] with the Lord
[1:04:11] and with his word
[1:04:14] amen amen
[1:04:18] so my brother my sister tonight
[1:04:21] as brother Branham told us tonight
[1:04:30] and here we are in the time that the
[1:04:33] word has been unveiled itself
[1:04:42] he said as we see his word unveiling
[1:04:46] itself day by day how many of them
[1:04:53] in 1933 a vision came and spoke to him
[1:04:57] William Branham preached the word
[1:05:00] do the work of an evangelist
[1:05:04] and he preached the pure word
[1:05:09] and it was God that was revealing to him
[1:05:12] the word
[1:05:15] I don't want to spend more time here
[1:05:19] because I might reached a point where I
[1:05:21] have not reached my point
[1:05:23] so let me keep making my noise
[1:05:27] but I want you to know this
[1:05:30] that this great message
[1:05:35] is the revelation of the entire word of
[1:05:39] God
[1:05:39] [Applause]
[1:05:42] it is the revelation of all the hidden
[1:05:46] truth throughout the ages until the
[1:05:48] cloud you see I mean of the second
[1:05:50] Twitter when in 1958 he is already
[1:05:53] declaring that okay
[1:06:00] as we see his word being unveiled day by
[1:06:04] day oh yeah
[1:06:07] so there is a deep right here that we
[1:06:10] can dig into
[1:06:14] help each one of us to have a Clear
[1:06:17] Vision about the end times
[1:06:21] oh brothers and sisters
[1:06:24] we thank the Lord for this
[1:06:28] and we thank him from the bottom of our
[1:06:31] house
[1:06:33] to send us the revealed word amen
[1:06:46] lifting him out of History
[1:06:52] by the third pool
[1:06:57] why
[1:07:01] not listen to brother Branham himself
[1:07:08] the inspiration lifting him up out of
[1:07:12] History
[1:07:13] we all know
[1:07:19] we know that the Lord Jesus Christ have
[1:07:23] three parts in his ministry
[1:07:26] [Music]
[1:07:28] and I really want to talk about brother
[1:07:31] Branham there is
[1:07:40] Divine Healing
[1:07:43] he was holding people by the hands and
[1:07:47] he says the vibrations
[1:07:49] you speak the blessing
[1:07:53] and pray for the patients and the man
[1:07:57] know the woman was here
[1:07:59] and the second pool was prophecy
[1:08:03] he could look at someone
[1:08:06] and tell that person where he was coming
[1:08:09] from
[1:08:11] the thoughts and intent of his heart
[1:08:15] amen amen
[1:08:18] and then he moved on to the third floor
[1:08:21] oh
[1:08:22] brothers and sisters
[1:08:25] and that's where really
[1:08:28] that's why I want to make some noise
[1:08:31] tonight
[1:08:32] and I want to say this tonight
[1:08:35] I believe you all know you are
[1:08:38] acquainted with this
[1:08:44] had been impersonated
[1:08:48] to the point that okay
[1:09:34] foreign
[1:09:38] [Music]
[1:10:11] [Music]
[1:11:02] there won't be any copy with this
[1:11:18] and he went to another dimensions
[1:11:24] [Music]
[1:11:27] because he had a little child shoe that
[1:11:30] he was trying to listen
[1:11:34] and it was a little show
[1:11:37] um
[1:11:39] but he was using the wrong side and he
[1:11:42] was not going through
[1:11:43] and the same man came back
[1:11:47] he said this is not the way you do it
[1:11:50] if you turn it this way look
[1:11:53] and he told him
[1:11:56] interpret the vision he says
[1:12:02] you cannot teach Pentecostal baby
[1:12:05] spiritual things
[1:12:54] inside there
[1:12:56] they
[1:12:59] cannot explain anything
[1:13:02] so in that particular party
[1:13:05] the pillar of fires
[1:13:11] and went and stood on top of that
[1:13:14] building
[1:13:15] and the man that was fitting to him he
[1:13:19] said
[1:13:21] we'll meet you right there
[1:13:25] and that will be the third floor
[1:13:29] amen amen
[1:13:31] hello so
[1:13:33] the female name brother Branham
[1:13:36] since that time
[1:13:40] 800 and we expected this it was so he
[1:13:44] was under the expectation of the purple
[1:13:49] he stay alert waiting all the time for
[1:13:53] the third book
[1:13:55] that really will cut my heart the
[1:13:58] Prophet The Prophet
[1:14:00] was knowing that there was a third pool
[1:14:04] coming up
[1:14:07] so brother Brandon was on the look so
[1:14:10] that he doesn't miss that third floor
[1:14:14] that's why listen to what brother brand
[1:14:16] I'm saying
[1:14:18] so from paragraph three
[1:14:21] in the version that I have here
[1:14:24] brother Branham says this is
[1:14:33] there was I was told in a vision that
[1:14:36] the lord gave me few years ago
[1:14:39] I'm just gonna take the highlight of the
[1:14:42] vision
[1:14:45] keeping my thoughts on what I'm trying
[1:14:48] to say
[1:14:51] because you must know how to score and
[1:14:54] to play the ball amen amen
[1:15:02] we don't want to misinterpret the word
[1:15:07] we don't wanna took the word out of its
[1:15:10] context
[1:15:13] those are the two things that we have
[1:15:15] been warned by brother
[1:15:18] in this message
[1:16:07] [Music]
[1:16:23] so we are are remembering and respecting
[1:16:26] the three amen amen in decency and
[1:16:30] brother Branham says
[1:16:31] [Music]
[1:16:33] and I wrote it in a book at home
[1:16:40] and it's concerning the change in my
[1:16:43] Ministry are we oh yes
[1:16:52] the ministry have to change
[1:16:55] he had to receive the turtle amen hello
[1:16:59] now continue I'm gonna continue
[1:17:02] brother Branham says this
[1:17:05] important so he remind us of something
[1:17:08] he here very important
[1:17:16] he said but remember when we first built
[1:17:19] the Tabernacle you remember the vision
[1:17:21] that came in the morning when we laid
[1:17:24] the corner
[1:17:42] and told me
[1:17:46] the difference
[1:17:48] that the different things will take
[1:17:50] place
[1:17:52] so they took brother Branham and lift
[1:17:55] him up to the sky
[1:17:57] do the work often eventually
[1:18:01] begin to travel all over the world
[1:18:05] preaching the word of God
[1:18:07] and many things happened
[1:18:12] that's when the first sentence
[1:18:17] was manifested all around the world
[1:18:22] if you can remember
[1:18:27] and you watch that come to pass just
[1:18:30] exactly as he was
[1:18:33] what God thought brother
[1:18:38] he came to pass exactly like he was told
[1:19:01] [Music]
[1:19:14] [Music]
[1:19:15] surely that what he says it is
[1:19:21] and it has to be true
[1:19:24] so when God sent him
[1:19:29] despite all the opposition against him
[1:19:33] he didn't listen to The Voice
[1:19:36] he said I will move forward
[1:19:39] because God told me to go amen amen
[1:19:43] [Music]
[1:20:41] with the hands up quietly
[1:20:51] and so forth
[1:20:55] amen foreign
[1:21:37] [Applause]
[1:22:16] he went from me and went to run over
[1:22:19] that little Bill they said
[1:22:22] and stood there then went down
[1:22:27] and the voice spoke and say
[1:22:32] I will meet you in that place
[1:22:42] I have looked forward for that time
[1:22:46] so since that Vision
[1:22:53] under expectation to meet God there and
[1:22:57] then said then said the predication and
[1:23:00] in this sermon
[1:23:02] when brother Branham was preaching
[1:23:04] he spoke to the church he says
[1:23:08] he said I'm still waiting on it
[1:23:12] because he was coming from a missionary
[1:23:14] trip
[1:23:16] and he said he is second
[1:24:33] when I came back
[1:24:35] foreign
[1:25:25] [Music]
[1:26:19] temporarily working
[1:26:31] [Music]

[1:26:46] already there
[1:26:48] we are authentification of the Deadpool

[1:26:59] way foreign
[1:27:27] is already dead
[1:27:31] one problem is already dead he's already
[1:27:34] gone but what he says
[1:28:00] we must stay on the Lucas
[1:28:04] just like brother foreign
[1:28:31] possible religious responsibilities
[1:28:35] so they only left those from Russia
[1:28:40] he doesn't tell you something
[1:28:43] brothers and sisters
[1:28:46] when the squeeze will begin
[1:28:54] will be used now in its fullness
[1:29:04] it is
[1:29:10] under expectations
[1:29:17] foreign
[1:30:06] [Music]
[1:30:43] was not only just expecting but he was
[1:30:47] in
[1:30:49] actions shows if I'm waiting for
[1:30:52] something
[1:30:53] if I'm waiting for the Deadpool
[1:30:56] but do you have the Holy Ghost
[1:31:00] do you have an experience with God
[1:31:03] inexperienced person a personal
[1:31:05] experience with the Lord
[1:31:09] because I just follow my husband or my
[1:31:13] father in the message that's all that
[1:31:15] I've done no no no no no no no no no no
[1:31:17] you cannot be unexpected
[1:31:20] salvation is individuals
[1:31:28] each one of us must have a personal
[1:31:32] experience
[1:31:34] the experience of a Pentacles
[1:31:39] must have it personally remember
[1:31:52] even the trustee or the teacher even the
[1:31:55] person each one of us being experience
[1:31:59] must have a personal experience yeah
[1:32:02] [Applause]
[1:32:06] to be standing on the property
[1:32:10] and to preach to the Bride of Jesus
[1:32:12] Christ
[1:32:14] of Jesus Christ without the holy
[1:32:18] [Music]
[1:32:24] ghosts
[1:32:26] that's why he told to the disciples
[1:32:29] you waited Jerusalem
[1:32:46] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:32:49] [Music]
[1:32:50] brother
[1:32:52] beloved
[1:32:53] brother Branham continues
[1:32:57] he says I ignore what my friends are
[1:33:01] saying
[1:33:03] I don't know what it's gonna be like
[1:33:06] [Music]
[1:33:19] and I believe it's gonna be something
[1:33:21] that will help his secretary
[1:33:25] suffering in these days
[1:33:29] [Applause]
[1:33:31] and I told him that I will be uh I will
[1:33:36] be faithful
[1:33:37] yes
[1:33:44] and I will try to be more sincere than
[1:33:48] I've ever been with the other gift that
[1:33:50] he gave me
[1:33:52] because with the first and the second
[1:33:55] Paul
[1:33:56] demonstration because of public
[1:33:58] demonstration
[1:34:00] he calls impersonations
[1:34:08] brother Brian I'm someone said
[1:34:11] what he told me in that little wooden
[1:34:14] building
[1:34:15] I will go with faith in the grave
[1:34:19] Hallelujah
[1:34:21] that's why when brother Brandon was
[1:34:23] preaching the surface brother Branham
[1:34:26] says
[1:34:28] I'm careful not to say too much
[1:34:32] because
[1:34:34] I have to stop here
[1:34:37] there are certain things he could not
[1:34:40] say amen amen
[1:34:42] foreign
[1:34:58] [Music]
[1:35:29] and we are there what kind of example do
[1:35:32] we have fighting one another
[1:35:34] [Music]
[1:35:38] and we try to lift up ourselves in this
[1:35:42] message to be somebody
[1:35:48] we already have an example for the age
[1:35:51] our our example you know
[1:35:56] Jesus Christ is the top model
[1:36:02] [Applause]
[1:36:39] greater than what I did with my own
[1:36:41] Ministry
[1:36:43] it is the sovereignty of God
[1:36:48] and since he's our example my friend
[1:36:51] brother sit
[1:36:52] [Music]
[1:36:54] it's a privilege
[1:36:56] that me and you have Jesus Jesus when he
[1:37:00] came the farmer he didn't he was not
[1:37:03] married
[1:37:05] but we have an example
[1:37:09] a man that could live like Jesus Christ
[1:37:17] he has children like me and you
[1:37:40] what brought the fifth manifestation of
[1:37:43] the temple
[1:37:45] upon murder
[1:37:48] shows
[1:37:49] he was upon a misunderstanding in the
[1:37:53] family between a husband and wife
[1:37:58] say I love my wife so much lazy but in
[1:38:02] this case this is the word
[1:38:05] I have to show her the truth yes
[1:38:10] and she take care of my clothes
[1:38:14] she's the one between me and the public
[1:38:17] but when it belongs to the word of God
[1:38:21] I have to show her the truth we yes
[1:38:25] between mad and me
[1:38:29] between mother and Jesus Christ I love
[1:38:32] Jesus Christ
[1:38:35] May that also love Jesus more than me
[1:38:40] this was an example God was giving us
[1:38:53] [Music]
[1:39:27] [Music]
[1:39:43] when it will come the first time
[1:39:48] to see if it's gonna happen the way he
[1:39:50] told me
[1:39:53] if not we will get it
[1:39:56] and we will bring two sisters together
[1:40:00] will enter in the room
[1:40:08] I'm not saying it's going to be one way
[1:40:10] or the other sister thank you but I just
[1:40:14] want you to know because
[1:40:19] because it has been already declared
[1:40:26] that something new will happen
[1:40:30] and here we are
[1:40:32] but yeah you see now
[1:40:39] so my point tonight is that
[1:40:42] each one of us say oh my friend oh
[1:40:46] brother
[1:40:47] I am glad
[1:40:51] and I'm telling you the truth I'm happy
[1:40:56] with my hands up
[1:40:59] for me to travel
[1:41:02] I saw in every every obstacle God will
[1:41:06] move it on my road every trial God keep
[1:41:09] removing it that's the truth I say how
[1:41:12] did this happen but how is so perfect
[1:41:16] how is everything working out
[1:41:19] and something tells me
[1:41:23] he or he's already been lift out of
[1:41:25] History
[1:41:28] the one that was with Paul
[1:41:33] the one that was walking with the
[1:41:34] apostle
[1:41:36] he's now walking with his brother
[1:41:46] and then you must be worrying about that
[1:41:49] being your case so that the Lord will
[1:41:51] begin to walk with you through
[1:41:56] there was a pastor that was singing one

[1:45:43] you must even study the Bible we yes
[1:46:22] this is it
[1:46:36] today we have such an easy job with the
[1:46:40] voice of God dispatching the message
[1:46:45] it's easy and take my understanding my
[1:46:48] my little inspiration I compare it with
[1:46:51] the message
[1:46:53] and then I look
[1:46:56] if I saw something wrong I said my God
[1:47:03] listening to brother Brandon I would
[1:47:05] have made a mess
[1:47:27] himself somewhere
[1:47:32] [Music]
[1:47:33] every single day he was preaching this
[1:47:36] hill he isolated himself
[1:47:39] he was consecrating himself
[1:47:44] so I was there in the room
[1:47:49] and brother Brian I'm saying
[1:47:55] if I was not there at 11 o'clock in the
[1:47:58] morning
[1:48:01] and if the angel didn't come to give me
[1:48:04] the interpretation of it
[1:48:08] I would have said other things
[1:48:18] why do we complicate our life in this
[1:48:21] message
[1:48:22] why do we complicate ourselves in this
[1:48:25] message
[1:48:26] brother preacher Mr preacher why do you
[1:48:30] complicate your life

[1:48:51] that's the way you're supposed to be
[1:48:53] I listen to the message first
[1:48:55] oh I see what brother Branham is trying
[1:48:58] to say so in this message
[1:49:02] so he want to say this he want to say
[1:49:04] this
[1:49:06] now I begin to study on it
[1:49:09] and I study on it

[1:49:15] when I'm studying
[1:49:18] the Holy Ghost can come
[1:49:21] and then direct you to another Court
[1:49:24] and I say yes I remember quote yeah

[1:51:46] we are a privilege
[1:51:51] so oh God
[1:51:56] let this Divine program we ask you in
[1:52:00] this building
[1:52:03] [Music]
[1:52:05] not this one who have stayed behind
[1:52:08] nature
[1:52:12] from the fields
[1:52:17] and has been prayer warriors
[1:52:22] [Music]
[1:52:48] [Music]
[1:53:26] it wasn't foreign
[1:54:32] because we feel that it is your great
[1:54:35] Providence to do so
[1:54:38] thank you Jesus somewhere that's why
[1:54:43] it was the third pool
[1:54:47] it's the opening of the word
[1:54:50] we all know that
[1:54:53] it's the opening of the word we know
[1:54:55] that
[1:54:58] also said
[1:55:00] foreign
[1:55:07] and I know what he's doing
[1:55:11] the opening of the word
[1:55:15] does something to the people
[1:55:20] listen to me carefully
[1:55:25] I'm speaking simple
[1:55:27] I have so many scripture I can prove it
[1:55:29] to you
[1:55:34] the third pool is the opening of the
[1:55:36] word
[1:55:37] brother Branham says
[1:55:40] I know what the third police
[1:55:43] and I know what the third pool does
[1:55:46] Amen
[1:55:48] when brother Branham started
[1:55:52] the first thing he created Square
[1:55:57] that's what the third Pope manifested
[1:56:03] but why is the creation with the opening
[1:56:07] of the word the same thing
[1:56:10] there was a scripture brother Branham
[1:56:12] was not understanding
[1:56:14] mark 11.
[1:56:16] 23.
[1:56:18] that scripture was difficult for brother
[1:56:21] Branham to get it
[1:56:23] when brother Branham was hunting
[1:56:26] he didn't have squel
[1:56:30] and he heard in his heart
[1:56:34] if you speak to this mountain
[1:56:39] he said but this scripture again I don't
[1:56:42] understand the scripture
[1:56:44] and I don't even want to preach the
[1:56:46] scripture because if I preach
[1:56:49] this is what I would say this is what I
[1:56:51] won't say
[1:56:55] but that scripture keep coming back to
[1:56:57] him
[1:56:59] Mark 11 23 Mark 11 23. brother brought
[1:57:04] him say what is going on again and
[1:57:07] brother Branham begin to meditate on
[1:57:08] that scripture and the Holy Ghost speak
[1:57:12] s
[1:57:17] why do you think that this power was
[1:57:20] only for the people in the Old Testament
[1:57:24] before the atonement
[1:57:27] before the crucifixion
[1:57:30] first
[1:57:36] God say let me ask you a few questions
[1:57:41] let me ask you the prophet in the Old
[1:57:43] Testament were they speaking by
[1:57:45] themselves or someone else was speaking
[1:57:47] do you know he said no no God I said you
[1:57:50] he was a God who was speaking through
[1:57:52] them
[1:57:55] now you everything that you did through
[1:57:58] your ministry so where did you get that
[1:58:01] from is it yourself he says no no no God
[1:58:04] he was not me it was you
[1:58:07] now I begin to understand what he was
[1:58:10] trying to say now I see
[1:58:13] so if a man is so wrapped up
[1:58:18] [Music]
[1:58:38] now speak the word
[1:58:41] and whatever will say will happen
[1:58:44] that's how brother brother by speaking
[1:58:48] the word you see my brother there was a
[1:58:51] scripture
[1:58:52] and God revealed to him the scripture
[1:58:56] and he spoke the word yes

[2:06:02] you see brother Branham was always under
[2:06:04] expectation
[2:06:06] this he was always under expectation
[2:06:11] you can

[2:06:26] now listen
[2:06:29] so since I have few minutes
[2:06:32] let me summarize
[2:06:40] on this conclusion
[2:06:44] I'm going to go straight to the point
[2:06:50] brother Branham says this
[2:06:56] is from the beginning
[2:07:00] he says
[2:07:02] the general situation
[2:07:05] that we are now living
[2:07:09] it's
[2:07:12] showing us or indicating two things
[2:07:17] and those two things
[2:07:22] it's the end of the world history
[2:07:26] [Music]
[2:07:29] and the end time
[2:07:33] so let's be very careful
[2:07:38] listen to what brother Branham say in
[2:07:41] paragraph 13.
[2:07:43] and tonight
[2:07:45] foreign
[2:07:52] and we are looking at two sins
[2:07:55] happening and taking place
[2:07:59] and these are the sins
[2:08:04] the first one is the end of world
[2:08:07] history
[2:08:10] and the other one is the end of the time
[2:08:18] great man throughout the ages
[2:08:23] they're long to see this time
[2:08:26] that we are approaching now
[2:08:30] hello
[2:08:37] and we are living in this glorious time
[2:08:40] of the sunset
[2:08:44] and then of the Eternal Light yes
[2:08:52] and I believe that we are living in the
[2:08:55] most glorious age
[2:08:58] that was never given to men
[2:09:02] it is the end of time
[2:09:09] and the fusion with eternity
[2:09:17] history only relate to us what we read
[2:09:23] about what happened before is
[2:09:30] the way which will happen in the future
[2:09:32] is in the hands
[2:09:42] many records from history
[2:09:47] because I don't think we will need that
[2:09:50] we said
[2:09:58] will bring into at some deep water okay
[2:10:59] but you cannot stop it only admiring the
[2:11:03] history of the hero in the Bible
[2:11:06] what God did in the Bible
[2:11:09] they wanted to do with you
[2:11:13] but when we are in the end times
[2:11:18] [Music]
[2:11:20] and the last thing that remained for God
[2:11:23] to fulfill that he said
[2:11:39] if you believe that this is the gospel
[2:11:43] thicker and then to the Sea you desire
[2:11:47] you decide
[2:11:49] to begin to do that
[2:11:51] [Music]
[2:11:53] and be certain of God
[2:11:56] he said wants something will happen to
[2:11:59] you if you are sick
[2:12:01] you can leave tonight here
[2:12:06] if you're not safe
[2:12:08] you can be saved tonight
[2:12:36] it is deity
[2:12:38] [Applause]
[2:12:48] it is not a man
[2:12:50] [Applause]
[2:12:53] [Music]
[2:12:56] Sailors
[2:12:57] the holy spirit that anoint him
[2:13:01] and using his mouth
[2:13:04] and Jesus himself
[2:13:23] and then you will speak prayer Brothers
[2:13:53] depression he is the god of the presence
[2:13:58] you can bring him in the sin to stop the
[2:14:01] natural crisis that is going on now

[2:25:10] that you ever face in the tribulation

[2:25:43] what you see the word the opening the
[2:25:46] third pool is the opening of the word
[2:25:48] but that opening of the word has
[2:25:50] something that is doing in you maybe you
[2:25:53] don't realize it yet but sooner you will
[2:25:55] find out that even the torch you're
[2:25:57] speaking are gonna be doing things
[2:26:00] you're gonna think something and you go
[2:26:02] somewhere and it happened exactly just
[2:26:04] the way you were thinking it is no
[2:26:06] longer you that are doing that by
[2:26:09] receiving the word you are receiving
[2:26:11] somebody and the restoration of the word
[2:26:13] brother Branham say you bring the
[2:26:15] restoration of the power
[2:26:23] amen
[2:26:25] amen God even unveil the devil from
[2:26:29] martyr and my and Mary
[2:26:31] he can make you do something that look
[2:26:34] like it's normal it is religious but if
[2:26:38] you look at the purpose of that thing is
[2:26:40] just to take you away from the church
[2:26:42] away from the question and answer away
[2:26:46] from your prayer life and once you once
[2:26:49] whatever God want to do is finish then
[2:26:52] the devil releases you
[2:26:54] and when you come back to you miss
[2:26:55] something all the time you miss
[2:26:57] something all the time you miss a
[2:26:59] service
[2:27:00] you cannot get comfortable now
[2:27:04] if you get comfortable the crisis is
[2:27:07] gonna
[2:27:09] wake you up amen
[2:27:12] amen amen
[2:27:13] one of this day
[2:27:15] we won't have church
[2:27:18] amen you won't be calling me a home
[2:27:22] because I'm giving you all the
[2:27:24] ammunition here
[2:27:26] amen you won't be calling brother Robert
[2:27:29] amen you got to take the word that you
[2:27:32] has been hearing
[2:27:34] amen and go ahead and use it for
[2:27:37] yourself so when
[2:27:39] you still have time as you see the day
[2:27:43] approaching do not forsake
[2:27:46] do not stay awake do not be distracted
[2:27:51] invest the best that you can to suck as
[2:27:55] much word as you can suck now forget
[2:27:58] about your friend forget about your
[2:28:01] friendship forget about the party forget
[2:28:03] about the the the the the birthday this
[2:28:06] Sunday forget about all of that you can
[2:28:08] speak on the phone two hours forget
[2:28:10] about it you can pray also two hours it
[2:28:12] depends on what you want to choose
[2:28:16] because if you don't want to come to
[2:28:18] church there will come in time when the
[2:28:19] church is closed they will tell you now
[2:28:21] you can stay at home and enjoy the
[2:28:23] tribulation
[2:28:27] amen
[2:28:28] amen
[2:28:30] the only hope
[2:28:31] is in this word and the more you get
[2:28:35] deep in the word
[2:28:37] you will look at everything that is
[2:28:40] going into the world and you are singing
[2:28:42] like an antinger
[2:28:43] it doesn't mean that you don't see it
[2:28:46] but the God that he that is in you
[2:28:49] amen you begin to see things in a
[2:28:52] different way because God took Israel in
[2:28:55] the order atonement and God preserved
[2:28:58] their clothing for 40 years
[2:29:00] a clothing 40 years not a person a
[2:29:04] clothing and a shoe was protected 40
[2:29:07] years so 40 years you have your shoe and
[2:29:11] nothing happened to the shoe even if a
[2:29:13] dog touched your shoe the dog cannot eat
[2:29:16] that specific tree
[2:29:18] because the shoe was anointed not to be
[2:29:21] eaten for 40 years
[2:29:24] what kind of the material
[2:29:27] work on the chemistry work on the
[2:29:30] science was behind that
[2:29:33] [Music]
[2:29:35] amen amen if the anointing of God can
[2:29:40] take the molecule of a shoe and what
[2:29:43] somebody made and preserve it whatever
[2:29:45] your body
[2:29:51] and Jesus was not dead yet this was
[2:29:54] under the old atonement
[2:29:58] that's why brother Branham say we have
[2:30:01] opportunity that all of them even Enoch
[2:30:05] all of them never him the opportunity we
[2:30:08] have now you remember the court
[2:30:11] you don't want to stay out we already
[2:30:13] have the problems you need to make sure
[2:30:16] you are correct with your life so you
[2:30:19] can be partaker and enjoy these things
[2:30:22] amen amen if I don't have money I will
[2:30:25] just speak
[2:30:30] you will even create food
[2:30:34] you have two choices you can create
[2:30:36] money or you can create a direct food
[2:30:44] okay let me say this then I close
[2:30:49] when Jesus was in the wilderness and he
[2:30:53] fed the multitude
[2:30:55] did they bring him a fish out of the
[2:30:57] water
[2:31:00] did they bring him a fish from the water
[2:31:02] that Jesus have to clean they bring him
[2:31:05] a fish that was already out
[2:31:06] he was cooked when Jesus multiplied the
[2:31:10] fish
[2:31:11] did they multiply a raw fish or cooked
[2:31:14] fish where did he get the spice
[2:31:21] now you can believe now now your faith
[2:31:23] is up right now your Faith's going up I
[2:31:26] know some of you the battery was dead so
[2:31:28] I have to plug you up now you see
[2:31:31] you see where did Jesus get the spice
[2:31:38] do you understand what I'm saying Jesus
[2:31:40] match
[2:31:43] even much the fish that was already
[2:31:46] cooked
[2:31:48] he can match any chef
[2:31:50] and I'm gonna say something when he
[2:31:52] created the wine he's one was better
[2:31:55] than the wine that Man created
[2:31:58] they even told him they say wait a
[2:32:00] minute where was this wine all the time
[2:32:03] you should have start with this one
[2:32:05] first this one was sweeter than the
[2:32:08] other one foreign
[2:32:14] [Applause]
[2:32:22] spoken word Tabernacle
[2:32:25] is not a continuation of a church
[2:32:29] spoken word Tabernacle is not a church
[2:32:31] that was built just for to have a
[2:32:34] message church that was not the way he
[2:32:37] was to be this church was built for you
[2:32:40] to prepare for the rapture

[2:32:51] goes with it it will give you Fellowship
[2:32:52] it will give you friend it will give you
[2:32:54] family but that's not really the reason
[2:32:56] why he was

[2:33:04] something until you you are completely
