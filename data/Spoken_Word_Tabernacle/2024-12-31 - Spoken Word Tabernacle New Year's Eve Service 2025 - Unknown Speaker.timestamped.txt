[1:11:45] or speak for another he said or other
[1:11:48] make or he can make decisions on behalf
[1:11:52] of another is that right of a person
[1:11:55] know group is that right right you are

[1:12:13] he had us in prostituting he thought he
[1:12:16] had us in drinking he thought he had us
[1:12:18] in gambling but if what happened Pastor
[1:12:21] the prodical son came what we came to
[1:12:24] our
[1:12:25] is that right you came unto yourself uh
[1:12:29] then you recognize deep down inside it
[1:12:32] was a cry it was a call is that right
[1:12:34] when you taking looking in this word in

[1:13:59] Overcomers you are the Overcomers you

[1:14:25] religious demons I'm telling you but God
[1:14:27] has given us the answer for them is that
[1:14:30] right when God broke those Seven Seals
[1:14:32] is that right once he broke those Seven
[1:14:35] Seals All That Paul left out he's given
[1:14:38] us to be able to defeat the enemy why no

[1:28:12] to read the the scripture
[1:28:34] if you if you're there can you say
[1:28:36] Amen in Matthew chap 16 verse 13 to um
[1:28:40] to 19 the Bible says when Jesus came
[1:28:43] into the coast of the ceria Philippi he
[1:28:47] asked his disciples saying whom do man
[1:28:50] say that I the son of man am and they
[1:28:53] said some say that thou art John the
[1:28:56] Baptist son of some Elias and others
[1:28:59] Jeremiah and or one of the prophets he
[1:29:02] said unto them but whom say ye that I am
[1:29:05] and Simon Peter answered and said Thou
[1:29:07] Art the Christ the son of the Living God
[1:29:10] and Jesus answered and said unto him
[1:29:12] blessed art thou Simon bar Jonah for
[1:29:16] Flesh and Blood have not revealed it
[1:29:18] unto thee but my Father which is in
[1:29:20] heaven and I say also unto thee that
[1:29:23] thou
[1:29:24] Peter and Upon This Rock I will build my
[1:29:27] church and the Gates of Hell shall not
[1:29:30] Prevail against it and I will give unto
[1:29:32] thee the keys the the Keys of the
[1:29:35] Kingdom of Heaven and whatsoever Thou
[1:29:37] shalt bind on Earth shall be bound in
[1:29:39] heaven and whatsoever Thou shalt loose
[1:29:42] on Earth shall be loose in heaven may
[1:29:44] God bless the reading of his word y'all
[1:29:45] may be
[1:29:46] seated and my subject tonight is the
[1:29:48] shout the cry and speak in other words
[1:29:51] prophesying that's right and the reason
[1:29:55] why I picked this well the prophet ver
[1:29:57] is sometimes God cannot answer
[1:30:00] spontaneously how how many knows that
[1:30:03] remember Daniel had prayed and I believe
[1:30:06] it was 20 20 it was 20 21 days and
[1:30:10] something like that before the angel
[1:30:12] could get to him but he finally gets
[1:30:17] around and the reason why I read that
[1:30:20] scripture is because well like you saw
[1:30:23] the title it says speak the shout the
[1:30:25] cry and speak and we since we are the
[1:30:29] children of God and we're called to
[1:30:32] speak and I remember the scripture says
[1:30:34] God's word when it's sent out it will
[1:30:35] never return to him void and says we are
[1:30:37] also the children of God that mean when
[1:30:39] we speak our word should also not return
[1:30:41] to us void why because it should be God
[1:30:43] in us speaking and not
[1:30:46] us now in habakuk 2:3 says for the
[1:30:50] vision is yet for an appointed time but
[1:30:52] at the end is shall speak and not lie
[1:30:55] though it terries wait for it because it
[1:30:58] will surely come it will not t because
[1:31:01] sometime we may speak over our issues
[1:31:03] our problems and after that we want it
[1:31:04] to happen simultaneously but but the
[1:31:07] scripture says you can wait because if
[1:31:10] you it's like you're trying to rush God
[1:31:11] sometimes you can when you speak you
[1:31:13] need to wait a little bit be a little
[1:31:14] bit patient sometime it may happen at
[1:31:16] that instant sometime it may take a
[1:31:18] little bit of time in Exodus 13:1 17 it
[1:31:22] says and it came to pass pass when when
[1:31:25] Pharaoh had let let the people go and
[1:31:28] God let them not through the way of the
[1:31:30] land of the Philistines although that
[1:31:32] was near for God said let's pre
[1:31:35] Adventure the people repent when they
[1:31:36] see war and they return to Egypt see
[1:31:39] many time people they have like this pre
[1:31:44] like this premeditated thought when
[1:31:46] they're facing a trial and when they
[1:31:47] speak and they start thinking maybe it's
[1:31:49] not going to happen maybe this this and
[1:31:51] the third that's why God when he saw the
[1:31:54] Israelites when they were sojourning and
[1:31:56] trying to leave Egypt God already knew
[1:31:58] that they were going to be scared that's
[1:31:59] why he made them deviate away from it
[1:32:01] because if you go down later on when the
[1:32:03] people um of God Israel were facing the
[1:32:06] Red Sea and they saw the Red Sea they
[1:32:09] were there were scared they were scared
[1:32:10] of War because the Egyptian were
[1:32:12] following them and I'mma connect all of
[1:32:14] them in a bit if you just follow the
[1:32:16] thought in Job chapter 3 it says for the
[1:32:19] thing which I greatly feared is come
[1:32:22] upon me and that which I was afraid of
[1:32:25] is come unto me I was not in safety
[1:32:28] neither had I rest neither was I quiet
[1:32:31] yet trouble that yet trouble came
[1:32:34] because the thing about job is because
[1:32:36] he had premeditated fear that oh I might
[1:32:38] lose this my I might lose this some of
[1:32:40] us are walking through our day-to-day
[1:32:42] life maybe you're not speaking it out
[1:32:44] loud but you're speaking in your head
[1:32:45] and when you're speaking in your head it
[1:32:47] will come to pass like that so don't be
[1:32:49] shocked when you see something happen
[1:32:51] you're like well why is this happening
[1:32:53] maybe you need need to check on what
[1:32:54] you've been premeditating on on what
[1:32:56] you've been thinking
[1:32:59] over now the prophet of God said that
[1:33:02] now when he speaks of his vision whether
[1:33:05] it's wrath or whether it's healing it
[1:33:07] may linger but it's it's got to come to
[1:33:10] pass if he speaks it in the name of the
[1:33:12] Lord see it might be a blessing that he
[1:33:15] speaks for you he might tell you a
[1:33:18] certain thing and you can't see it at
[1:33:20] all you say how be it why he told he
[1:33:23] told me so said the Lord this is going
[1:33:26] to happen and that was going to happen
[1:33:29] and he a happen the man is wrong now
[1:33:32] you'll be judged and for disbelieving it
[1:33:35] but it's going to happen anyhow see it's
[1:33:38] got to happen though it
[1:33:40] lingers though it linger the Bible said
[1:33:43] yet will it speak in it it in its season
[1:33:48] till till it'll come to pass the prophet
[1:33:52] the prophets only looking off and seeing
[1:33:55] something he's talking about his looking
[1:34:00] at he ain't thinking about here and what
[1:34:04] you look or what you look like now he's
[1:34:07] looking what it's going to be and when
[1:34:09] he speaks that if it's the word of if
[1:34:12] it's the word of the lord it's already
[1:34:14] being spoke and there's nothing the
[1:34:17] world can stop it you see that's right
[1:34:19] only God himself you see that's why I
[1:34:22] had said earlier when a believer speak
[1:34:24] that mean his word should not also
[1:34:26] return to him void why because brother
[1:34:28] brandham said A True Believer is someone
[1:34:30] that believes in the word and the word
[1:34:31] only he stays in order with the word and
[1:34:34] if you stay in order with the word that
[1:34:35] mean when you're speaking what should
[1:34:37] come out of your word what should come
[1:34:39] out of your mouth should be the word
[1:34:41] because if you're feeding on the word
[1:34:42] the only thing that you can replicate
[1:34:43] the only thing that can come out of your
[1:34:45] mouth is the
[1:34:47] word and just to save time instead of um
[1:34:52] going turning the page well in Joshua
[1:34:54] 6:20 it speaks about we are all familiar
[1:34:58] with the story how the Israelite
[1:35:01] children went around Jericho seven time
[1:35:03] then after that they blew the trumpet
[1:35:04] then they shouted which is actually
[1:35:05] where I got my inspiration from because
[1:35:07] I was wondering what was the shout why
[1:35:09] did they shout because many time I read
[1:35:10] that scripture sometime I Ponder I was
[1:35:12] like what exactly did they speak and I
[1:35:15] started thinking I was like maybe I
[1:35:17] should I decide to kind of do my own
[1:35:20] like testing for example for example if
[1:35:22] I were to ask brother John over there to
[1:35:24] give me a shout how would you shout all
[1:35:27] right then see but if I were to turn to
[1:35:29] let's say my mom my or M and I told them
[1:35:33] um I told them excuse
[1:35:37] me I told them to give a shout or
[1:35:43] to what would you
[1:35:46] [Applause]
[1:35:47] do when I had heard that when I when I
[1:35:50] was thinking about that and I was
[1:35:51] thinking maybe this shout May maybe for
[1:35:53] me to understand why the Israelite
[1:35:55] children were shouting I need to go to
[1:35:57] Israel and ask them to shout then I was
[1:35:59] like that's probably thinking carnal
[1:36:01] then I was like how how would I know
[1:36:03] what they said and how did they know
[1:36:04] what to say because the Bible doesn't
[1:36:06] say exactly what they said and I started
[1:36:08] thinking about brother Brandon when he
[1:36:10] went squirrel hunting when he was
[1:36:12] walking and there was no game and the
[1:36:14] spirit of the Lord came down the spirit
[1:36:15] of the Lord was talking to him and was
[1:36:17] telling him what he needed and as he was
[1:36:19] talking he was telling him what he
[1:36:21] needed to say that's right that's
[1:36:23] exactly
[1:36:24] and when brother Brandon the moment he
[1:36:26] spoke and the word left his mouth the
[1:36:29] word whatever he said had to come to
[1:36:31] pass because the first time when he was
[1:36:33] hunting for three squirrel on the third
[1:36:35] one he got the three squirrel but then
[1:36:37] he was trying to push for a fourth one
[1:36:39] but it didn't happened because he didn't
[1:36:40] ask for a fourth one but then later on
[1:36:42] he came again and he was squirrel
[1:36:44] hunting again and the first he
[1:36:48] um the second time when he went squirrel
[1:36:51] hunting the voice of the Lord came to
[1:36:52] him and told him to speak where do you
[1:36:54] want the squirrel but since his first
[1:36:56] experience with the squirrel boosted his
[1:36:59] faith that he was like I will trust in
[1:37:01] you Lord so he said I want to scroll
[1:37:03] there there and there and so since he
[1:37:05] already got the first experience and he
[1:37:07] spoke and he knows when you speak when
[1:37:09] God say speak is going to come to pass
[1:37:11] when he spoke all he did was just wait
[1:37:13] for the squir to show up he saw the
[1:37:15] first one he shout it he saw the second
[1:37:16] one he shout it then he waited for the
[1:37:18] third one but the third one although he
[1:37:20] pointed there he did not come there he
[1:37:21] went in a different direction then he
[1:37:23] tried to shoot it until he ran out of
[1:37:25] Mag basically and when he ran out of Mag
[1:37:28] he realized that that's not where I
[1:37:30] spoke I did not speak for the squirrel
[1:37:32] to show up over there that's why even if
[1:37:34] I try to shoot it no matter how how many
[1:37:37] time I try it's not going to come to
[1:37:39] pass why because that's not the word
[1:37:41] that came out of my mouth that's why
[1:37:43] right then later on as he waited when
[1:37:45] that Revelation came to him and he
[1:37:46] caught it he waited then the squirrel
[1:37:49] that he was looking for it was very late
[1:37:50] at night the squirrel that he was
[1:37:52] looking for showed up
[1:37:54] then he shot it but it looked like it
[1:37:56] ran away so brother Brenham did not
[1:37:57] believe it so later on he waited again
[1:38:00] then he saw in fourth squirrel which he
[1:38:02] shot and he went dead then he remembered
[1:38:06] um throughout throughout uh what's it
[1:38:09] called throughout the night when he went
[1:38:12] to retrieve his squirrels because in his
[1:38:14] head he remembered that he shot four
[1:38:16] squirrels but when he went to reach for
[1:38:18] the fourth one he could not find the
[1:38:19] fourth one then he returned he was
[1:38:21] telling his friends about the testimony
[1:38:23] and the words were coming out of his
[1:38:24] mouth now a brother had caught what he
[1:38:26] said then he said he then when the
[1:38:28] brother was praying he spoke Lord God if
[1:38:31] it be true so you can like vindicate
[1:38:34] your Prophet tomorrow when we go over
[1:38:37] there may we see the squirrel then and
[1:38:40] brother Brandon was a bit shocked
[1:38:41] because he's like this brother who's
[1:38:43] seen me do Miracles and he's doubting me
[1:38:45] then later on the next morning another
[1:38:47] brother had called on to the prayer that
[1:38:49] the other brother made then he said
[1:38:50] brother Brandon let's go up there and
[1:38:52] get the scroll that you had dropped and
[1:38:54] on the way to to get to verify the
[1:38:57] squirrel as brother Brandon was walking
[1:39:00] at this time he was walking alone the
[1:39:01] Holy Spirit came to him because he was
[1:39:03] thinking what if the squirrel isn't
[1:39:05] there then the Lord God came down and
[1:39:07] started talking to him he was like well
[1:39:08] if it's not there then speak it and
[1:39:10] brother Brenham says he was already
[1:39:12] shocked and he couldn't really trust in
[1:39:14] himself because when he did he couldn't
[1:39:16] find the squirrel last night he couldn't
[1:39:17] trust in himself so he was like Lord
[1:39:19] since you spoke it and you told me to
[1:39:20] speak I will just believe what you say
[1:39:23] then he arrived at the place where um
[1:39:25] the squirel was he looked around he
[1:39:27] looked around he couldn't find it then
[1:39:29] he then a thought came in he was like
[1:39:31] what if the squirrel is not there then a
[1:39:33] thought another thought came he say but
[1:39:35] what if it's there then he kept looking
[1:39:37] until he finally found the
[1:39:39] squirrel and the thing that I want you
[1:39:41] to catch from this is when the word of
[1:39:43] God comes when you're a Believer and you
[1:39:45] speak you need to speak things into
[1:39:47] existence you need to speak perfect and
[1:39:48] when you speak see when you speak it
[1:39:51] should bring when you speak the right
[1:39:53] thing is should bring a prophecy because
[1:39:55] if you look through 19 1959 on uh speak
[1:40:00] to this mountain brother brandom brother
[1:40:02] Brandon was talking and um he was
[1:40:05] actually with two brothers and those
[1:40:07] Brothers they got delivered they got
[1:40:09] saved and they were they were fishing
[1:40:11] and they couldn't catch any fish because
[1:40:12] they didn't have any bait so they were
[1:40:14] talking to brother brandham and they
[1:40:15] they were saying brother brandham maybe
[1:40:17] we could stop by the Little House nearby
[1:40:19] here and go get some bread to from a old
[1:40:21] lady here that used to give us bread to
[1:40:23] like catch bait and brother brandom when
[1:40:27] they were talking they say maybe we
[1:40:28] should go over there and we should also
[1:40:30] tell them we should also tell her about
[1:40:32] us our Salvation that we got saved and
[1:40:35] brother brandham said um like the spirit
[1:40:37] of the law had dropped down because he
[1:40:39] had said the right thing the spirit of
[1:40:41] the Lord dropped down and brother
[1:40:43] brandham started prophesying and even
[1:40:44] brother brandham didn't know what
[1:40:46] exactly he was prophesying so when you
[1:40:48] speak the right thing you're basically
[1:40:49] prophesying this Holy Spirit himself
[1:40:51] will come down to vindicate what you're
[1:40:53] prophesying and what I want you to just
[1:40:55] get from this is as we're stepping into
[1:40:57] this new year I want you to step into
[1:41:00] this New Year speaking the right thing
[1:41:02] and prophesying over your own CH over
[1:41:04] your own challenges like in Jericho when
[1:41:06] they had spoke maybe he had tooken a
[1:41:08] little bit of time and after before the
[1:41:10] wall had fell but even if it takes a
[1:41:12] little bit of time just wait a little
[1:41:14] bit as long as you're right with the
[1:41:16] Lord God whatever you speak shall come
[1:41:18] to pass may the Lord God bless you
[1:41:30] prise
[1:41:33] God praise God this is a good
[1:41:37] exercise amen sometime you have plenty
[1:41:40] of time to eat sometime you don't have
[1:41:43] so you got to learn how to eat quickly
[1:41:45] and to shoot the gun quickly and make it
[1:41:48] happen amen amen so when you speak
[1:41:53] you got to learn to be
[1:41:56] patient brother Bram say when God spoke

[1:48:40] the beginning to the end amen uh you may
[1:48:42] be seated amen so what I would like to
[1:48:44] get out of this right here is that you
[1:48:46] see that there's a time to everything
[1:48:49] amen and we see that you know we're on
[1:48:51] the cusp of a new year amen in in a uh
[1:48:54] in to our calendar to time for a new
[1:48:56] season amen so um I would like to speak
[1:48:59] on this subject because the Lord hit my
[1:49:01] heart to where you know you you get what
[1:49:03] you look for amen so how you step into
[1:49:06] this year man you're you're getting what
[1:49:08] you're going to look for in this year

[1:49:14] you're looking to you know if if you're
[1:49:16] iffy about the year if you're not fully
[1:49:18] you know ready for it you know you're
[1:49:19] not going to get anything out of it amen
[1:49:21] amen and you know that's you know it is
[1:49:23] it's That's the Law of like even of the
[1:49:25] Bible me reap what you sow amen that's
[1:49:27] how the Lord Works amen um I would like
[1:49:30] to go to uh Luke 4 verse
[1:49:33] 19 Luke
[1:49:45] 4:19 you get there say
[1:49:48] Amen Luke
[1:49:51] 49 it
[1:49:53] reads you know I'm I'm yeah I I'll say
[1:49:56] I'll read right here I'll start right
[1:49:57] here it says to preach the acceptable
[1:49:59] year of the Lord amen and he closed the
[1:50:02] book amen and he gave it again to the
[1:50:05] minister and sat down and the eyes of
[1:50:07] all of them all of them that were in the
[1:50:09] synagogue were fastened on him and he
[1:50:11] began to say unto them this day is the
[1:50:14] scripture fulfilled in your ears amen uh
[1:50:17] this really hit my heart really strong
[1:50:19] as well because it says you know uh
[1:50:23] what I was hung up on was he closed the
[1:50:25] book that's what I was like why did he
[1:50:26] close the book you know I was curious
[1:50:28] about that because he uh he says CU he
[1:50:31] say a prach acceptable year of the Lord
[1:50:33] then he says this day is the scripture
[1:50:35] fulfilled in your ears amen so what the
[1:50:37] Lord hit my heart was that you know when
[1:50:40] you go out in the world they have a
[1:50:42] closed book amen see you uh you're not
[1:50:45] going to walk around with the Bible in
[1:50:46] your hands you know all day so you can't
[1:50:49] go up to someone and say read this you
[1:50:50] know you are the Bible to them amen so
[1:50:54] when when you go to someone you are that
[1:50:56] scripture fulfilled amen so that's what
[1:50:59] the Lord hit my heart with because you
[1:51:01] know um you you can't you just can't go
[1:51:04] in the world and and go about and you
[1:51:06] know you you you have to live brother B
[1:51:09] says you know uh live me a sermon Don't
[1:51:11] Preach me a sermon amen so that's that's
[1:51:14] what you have to expect amen and um I
[1:51:17] was looking at uh the the uh uh the
[1:51:21] dictionary for season amen men because
[1:51:23] we know that uh for season they're
[1:51:25] fading in and fading out we know all
[1:51:27] things have a season amen and um we see
[1:51:30] that uh via Webster it says uh a season
[1:51:33] is a Time characteriz characterized by
[1:51:37] particular circumstance or feature amen
[1:51:40] so we know that each age is
[1:51:42] characterized by particular circumstance
[1:51:45] or feature amen and we know we're in the
[1:51:47] lateran church age amen and we know you
[1:51:50] know where our circumstance is that you
[1:51:53] know we uh um um Satan is at his
[1:51:55] strongest you know At His Highest and so
[1:51:57] is God that's our circumstance and our
[1:51:59] featur is that we're to overcome amen
[1:52:01] and um so I was looking at it and um I
[1:52:03] want to read a a quote it says uh this
[1:52:06] is 1955 the True Vine and the false Vine
[1:52:10] it reads it reads um and as long as
[1:52:12] there's an earth here God will have a
[1:52:14] church representing him I will restore
[1:52:16] sayith the Lord all the glory of the
[1:52:18] former days I will restore with a kaker
[1:52:20] worm left I will restore healing I will
[1:52:23] restore the Holy Spirit I will restore
[1:52:25] the joy amen I will restore everything
[1:52:28] that the first church had church had
[1:52:30] amen I'll restore it again in the last
[1:52:32] days we are living in that day when it
[1:52:34] is amen that is our fature amen and um
[1:52:37] it reads he says uh brother uh step off
[1:52:40] this thing and get over here as quick as
[1:52:42] you can amen because we want to take
[1:52:44] part of these blessings am me you don't
[1:52:46] want to be a bystander on the fence amen
[1:52:48] you know I want to take part of it too I
[1:52:50] I want to be part of the blessings amen
[1:52:53] and it reads um uh you know it's the
[1:52:55] season to apply the word amen you see if
[1:52:57] you don't apply the word you know if you
[1:52:59] choose to sleep on it you know you fall
[1:53:00] off the window and die amen amen because
[1:53:03] you know that's what happened with with
[1:53:04] the young man amen and you know it's a
[1:53:06] season for the sons and and Daughters of
[1:53:08] God to mount up with wings like an eagle
[1:53:10] and swore amen because we know that um
[1:53:13] uh the bride have made herself ready
[1:53:14] amen by the preaching of the word by the
[1:53:16] gospel amen and um and just like you
[1:53:19] know it was one of my topics I wanted to
[1:53:21] speak on was you know uh your faith
[1:53:23] works works your patience amen because
[1:53:26] we know um you know uh when you when you
[1:53:28] preach when you say something amen that
[1:53:31] uh it's prophecy coming out of your
[1:53:32] mouth amen and you know the prophet
[1:53:34] taught us that you know if you look for
[1:53:36] something to happen you know it may not
[1:53:38] happen at that moment but the way to
[1:53:40] look at it is doesn't happen today it'll

[2:18:58] sea but when Jesus finished dismissing
[2:19:01] the church he climbed on the mountain to
[2:19:07] pray at the same time they founds in the
[2:19:10] midst of the
[2:19:13] sea and there was a great Tempest that

[2:20:05] them walking on the sea walking on the
[2:20:10] sea and it was at that
[2:20:14] for that Jesus stretched forth his hand
[2:20:17] to save Peter
[2:20:22] because at the beginning they thought it
[2:20:24] was a ghost or spirit and Peter say if
[2:20:27] it's there beat me to come and he said
[2:20:31] come on and when he start walking he
[2:20:34] begin to get deeper
[2:20:36] one if you notice he was in the midst of
[2:20:39] the
[2:20:40] night we talking about the God of the
[2:20:42] midst of the
[2:20:44] night because in John 19
[2:20:48] ver8 in that passage of the Bible
[2:20:53] Jesus was
[2:20:56] crucified and there were two also that
[2:20:59] were crucified with and one from each
[2:21:03] side and Jesus was in the midst of
[2:21:06] them just just to to save a son of
[2:21:11] Abraham that was also condemned at the
[2:21:16] cross now remember where we read brother
[2:21:20] brother Bram didn't give us the
[2:21:22] scripture but brother Bram
[2:21:25] spoke that you can be
[2:21:28] saved that Fe the cross was saved
[2:21:32] without even being
[2:21:33] baptized you see what I'm trying to say
[2:21:37] he never was
[2:21:40] baptized just because Jesus was in the
[2:21:42] midst of the
[2:21:44] trial the the the the the very thing of
[2:21:47] Jesus being in the midst of your trial
[2:21:51] when you are in the house of the
[2:21:54] Lord you will be healed
[2:21:58] here without any
[2:22:01] effort without even your
[2:22:05] prayer just by hearing the word of God
[2:22:09] you will find yourself being
[2:22:10] automatically
[2:22:13] healed there are so many things I'm
[2:22:15] going to
[2:22:16] skip if you remember
[2:22:19] Daniel in the Book of Daniel 3: 25 26
[2:22:25] they took three
[2:22:26] Hebrews and they cast them into the
[2:22:30] fire but when the king approaches
[2:22:33] the he found the
[2:22:36] presence of the son of man in the midst
[2:22:40] of the fire walking on the midst of the
[2:22:43] fire with SH and and
[2:22:49] amen so when you facing a midnight of

[2:23:25] furnace and then the king asked a
[2:23:30] question when they came out from the
[2:23:32] fire they didn't even smell
[2:23:35] fire Danel the same
[2:23:38] thing they put him in the Lion's

[2:37:56] one brother Tony Allen come on for 15
[2:38:11] minutes praise God
[2:38:21] God bless
[2:38:25] y'all this is kind of a different
[2:38:29] position than singing a
[2:38:33] song my God is good he he knows what's
[2:38:38] best um if you got your Bibles let's go
[2:38:41] to the Book of
[2:38:46] Matthew chapter
[2:38:50] chapter 22
[2:38:55] verse4 yes sir got it say amen
[2:39:00] amen it's a very short scripture yes my
[2:39:03] brother but it says a
[2:39:06] lot it say for many are called but few
[2:39:10] are
[2:39:11] chosen sir let us bow our heads and pray
[2:39:15] dear heavenly father oh God we we
[2:39:17] dedicate this service back to you again
[2:39:19] oh God and as that you move me out of
[2:39:21] the way oh God and for this short period
[2:39:24] of time oh God that you will speak to
[2:39:25] your bride amen oh God and that that
[2:39:28] they'll be filled oh god with knowledge
[2:39:30] oh Lord God and Revelation oh God and
[2:39:33] that you will speak to whoever need to
[2:39:34] be spoken to Lord God we commit this
[2:39:37] back into your hands in the name of
[2:39:38] Jesus Christ we pray
[2:39:42] amen so the scripture say for many are
[2:39:45] called but few are chosen that's right
[2:39:47] you know it it really explains itself
[2:39:52] and I went to breaking it down I was I
[2:39:54] was thinking about I was like well if
[2:39:57] there are many that are called and and
[2:40:00] there's only a few that are chosen so
[2:40:03] and I went looking at a call and and the
[2:40:05] prophet talked about you know a calling
[2:40:07] is a cry out and and and he talked about
[2:40:12] being called and being called out
[2:40:15] so you can be called but you have to be
[2:40:19] chosen to be called
[2:40:22] out do that make sense so you can be
[2:40:25] called but you have to be chosen to be
[2:40:27] called out so my my my subject for
[2:40:30] tonight will be the chosen
[2:40:32] ones speak about the chosen
[2:40:43] ones in the message to Queen of
[2:40:46] Sheba sir it says Christ never died just
[2:40:50] to let people have
[2:40:53] sympathy God doesn't run his office that
[2:40:55] loose you wouldn't ruin your office that
[2:40:58] loose Christ never come from Heaven
[2:41:00] saying well I'll die and perhaps maybe
[2:41:02] people feel sorry for me and come no sir
[2:41:05] Christ died to call the election the
[2:41:08] body elected before the foundation of
[2:41:10] the world and them
[2:41:12] alone Jesus said no man can come to me
[2:41:15] my father draws him and all that comes
[2:41:18] to me I give him every ever lasting life
[2:41:20] and raise him up at the last day there
[2:41:23] you are there you are see Christ died to
[2:41:25] save those who God by for knowledge know
[2:41:27] will be saved so in other words we're
[2:41:30] the bride of Christ and Christ went to
[2:41:31] the Cross just for
[2:41:33] us so if it safe for me to say that the
[2:41:36] Holy Ghost belongs to us the Holy Ghost
[2:41:39] is ours and and we see we see people
[2:41:42] come in and and enjoy the effects of the
[2:41:44] Holy Ghost you know with it on their
[2:41:46] flesh but there's nobody that can get to
[2:41:48] enjoy this Holy Ghost like the bride of
[2:41:49] Christ which is the chosen because we
[2:41:52] have him on the inside and it's a
[2:41:54] different Revelation with him on the
[2:41:56] inside sir if I could kind of explain it
[2:42:00] it's it's like like going to a job
[2:42:03] interview if you notice um I noticed
[2:42:06] like if you go to a job interview you
[2:42:08] they may have one position that they
[2:42:09] want to
[2:42:11] feel but they were interview about 10
[2:42:15] people and
[2:42:17] I and other 10 people got
[2:42:23] called to the
[2:42:26] interview 10 people got called to the
[2:42:30] interview but it's only that one that
[2:42:33] got chose he get a different
[2:42:35] call he get a call that the other 10
[2:42:38] didn't get he gets the
[2:42:41] job so he gets called out of that group
[2:42:45] and he gets the job and and once he get
[2:42:48] on the job
[2:42:50] he goes to the supervisor the manager
[2:42:52] which is the boss
[2:42:54] man immediately when he get there the
[2:42:56] first thing they do is start pouring out
[2:42:58] that's it the knowledge of the
[2:43:01] business they bring they bring you in
[2:43:03] you know we pick you for the job you're
[2:43:05] the man for the job so now we're going
[2:43:07] to put you in our wings and we going to
[2:43:09] train you we're going to give you all
[2:43:10] the knowledge for this job and he began
[2:43:12] to pour all this knowledge in that guy
[2:43:15] and once he reach a point of perfection
[2:43:19] then he's allowed to run the
[2:43:22] business and then he can he he he don't
[2:43:24] feel bad to walk
[2:43:26] away sir I can leave I can walk away and
[2:43:29] leave brother Charles here now because
[2:43:30] brother Charles got the mind of the boss
[2:43:32] man I don't have to be there with
[2:43:34] brother Charles he can run the business
[2:43:36] himself and that's what God does he
[2:43:38] takes you behind the veil he gives you
[2:43:41] the mind of
[2:43:43] Christ so that you can run the business
[2:43:49] that's why that's why Jesus was so quick
[2:43:51] to say I am about my father's business
[2:43:54] but you got to have the mind of Christ
[2:43:56] to be about the father's business only
[2:43:59] Gods can be about the father's
[2:44:01] [Applause]
[2:44:11] business and when we say called out um
[2:44:14] we like to say oh we chosen we been
[2:44:16] called out to um the first thing we to
[2:44:19] think of oh man God chose me to go to
[2:44:21] heaven I'm going to heaven God chose me
[2:44:23] I'm going to heaven but really what he
[2:44:26] called you out was a sin condition it
[2:44:29] was your condition that he called you
[2:44:31] out of so your position can never
[2:44:35] change the the garden didn't change Adam
[2:44:38] position it put him in a different
[2:44:40] condition so when when you think about
[2:44:43] think about yourself you are a chosen
[2:44:46] generation each one of you are chosen to
[2:44:48] be here tonight not not just for this
[2:44:51] message but God took you out of that
[2:44:53] condition you was in we all was lost but
[2:44:55] God took you out of that condition he
[2:44:57] changed that condition he changed the
[2:44:59] way that he look at
[2:45:01] [Applause]
[2:45:02] [Music]
[2:45:05] you and and when it come down to
[2:45:07] choosing and being chos there there's
[2:45:09] nothing anybody can do about it God does
[2:45:11] the
[2:45:12] choosing so that mean your mama your
[2:45:15] daddy can't choose you the preacher
[2:45:17] can't choose you the proph can't choose
[2:45:19] you God got to do
[2:45:22] [Applause]
[2:45:26] it if you don't mind turning to the book
[2:45:28] of Samuel yes my brother 1 Samuel
[2:45:31] chapter 16 yes my
[2:45:36] brother and see can I tie this in real
[2:45:39] quick and and and and show you that it
[2:45:43] ain't up to
[2:45:47] you it's not up it's not up to you no
[2:45:55] sir
[2:45:57] sir 1 Samuel 16 yes my
[2:46:03] brother it's a very familiar
[2:46:07] Story chapter 16 verse1 it says and the
[2:46:12] Lord said unto Samuel yes sir how long
[2:46:15] would thou mourn for
[2:46:17] Saul seeing I have rejected him from
[2:46:20] reigning over Israel fill thy horn with
[2:46:23] oil and go and I will send thee to Jesse
[2:46:27] the bethlehemite for I have provided me
[2:46:29] a king among his sons so this is God
[2:46:32] giving
[2:46:34] instructions and and I looked at the
[2:46:36] word
[2:46:37] provide and one one of the definitions
[2:46:40] that stood out to me
[2:46:42] was to procure
[2:46:46] beforehand to get
[2:46:51] collect or make ready for a future
[2:46:55] use to
[2:46:58] prepare so in other words whoever this
[2:47:00] King was that he was going down to CH to
[2:47:02] choose
[2:47:04] uhhuh he had already been working
[2:47:08] [Applause]
[2:47:09] on so this this was not no situation
[2:47:12] where he was going to go down there and
[2:47:13] find him a man and then start molding no
[2:47:15] he was already working on this
[2:47:17] man and Samuel said how how can I go if
[2:47:21] if Saul hear it he will kill me and the
[2:47:23] Lord said take in heer with thee and say
[2:47:26] I am come to sacrifice the Lord so
[2:47:28] basically they they going to they going
[2:47:29] to call a meat they're going to call
[2:47:32] call a church meet and you know we're
[2:47:34] going to throw Saul
[2:47:36] off make a sacrifice unto me L this is
[2:47:39] God talking make a sacrifice unto me and
[2:47:41] and he he he won never think none
[2:47:44] of and he said what I want you to do
[2:47:46] this God still talking verse three want
[2:47:49] you to call Jesse to the
[2:47:51] sacrifice and I will show thee what Thou
[2:47:53] shalt
[2:47:54] do and thou shall anoint unto me him
[2:47:58] whom I name unto thee that's right and
[2:48:01] Samuel did that which the Lord spake and
[2:48:03] came to bethle Bethlehem and the Elders
[2:48:05] of the Town tremble that is coming the
[2:48:08] prophet coming so they don't know if
[2:48:10] it's bad or
[2:48:11] good so they ask him comest thou
[2:48:15] peacefully and he said peacefully I am
[2:48:17] come to sacrifice to the
[2:48:19] Lord sanctify yourselves and come with
[2:48:23] me to the sacrifice and he Sanctified
[2:48:27] Jesse and his sons and he called them to
[2:48:30] the
[2:48:30] sacrifice and it came to pass when they
[2:48:33] were come that he looked on
[2:48:36] elab now this is
[2:48:38] Samuel this is Samuel doing doing the
[2:48:41] looking right
[2:48:42] now it came to pass when they were come
[2:48:45] that he looked on elab and said surely
[2:48:48] the Lord's ano before him now if you
[2:48:50] know the order of Jesse's son you would
[2:48:52] know elel was the
[2:48:54] oldest so so in other words he he
[2:48:57] probably was the biggest you know you
[2:48:59] know by Statue so in other words the
[2:49:02] prophet Samuel was beginning to judge he
[2:49:05] was begin to look at his in a
[2:49:08] natural in a natural way that's your
[2:49:11] Psalm 82 ver7 that's right the prophet
[2:49:14] the natural side of him was getting
[2:49:15] ready to pick a man for God but but what
[2:49:19] but watch God correct them he going to
[2:49:20] quickly correct them verse 7 he said but
[2:49:23] the Lord said unto Samuel look not on
[2:49:25] his countenance or on the height of his
[2:49:28] stature because I have refused him for
[2:49:32] the Lord see not as man see for a man
[2:49:35] look lookth on the outward appearance
[2:49:37] but the Lord lookth on the
[2:49:39] heart lookth on the heart so now the
[2:49:43] calling getting ready to change in verse
[2:49:44] 8 not Jesse getting ready to start
[2:49:46] calling
[2:49:48] remember what I said the prophet can't
[2:49:51] call you and no man can call
[2:49:55] you so here come Jesse go he going to
[2:49:57] call he can't ready do his calling this
[2:49:59] is Chap this is verse eight then Jesse
[2:50:01] called
[2:50:02] abadal and like I said if you know the
[2:50:04] order of the son now badad is the second
[2:50:07] oldest so I'm I'm thinking in his mind
[2:50:09] he thinking well if the oldest one ain't
[2:50:11] ain't the one then it got to be the next
[2:50:13] one in
[2:50:17] line Lord
[2:50:19] so he called aadel and made him to pass
[2:50:22] before Samuel and he said neither have
[2:50:25] the Lord chosen
[2:50:26] this then Jess made shmar to pass by
[2:50:30] which was the third oldest so so
[2:50:32] basically he's going down the
[2:50:35] line can't be
[2:50:37] [Applause]
[2:50:38] David but this has got to be what they
[2:50:40] thinking it can't be David so so so so
[2:50:45] so this is what he said he said he said
[2:50:47] he made Shaman to passed by and he said
[2:50:50] neither have the Lord chosen
[2:50:51] this and again just made Seven of his
[2:50:55] sons to pass before Samuel so so that
[2:50:58] didn't satisfy he made them go past him
[2:51:00] again like surely they got to be in this
[2:51:02] seven and Samuel said unto Jesse the
[2:51:05] Lord have not chosen these and Samuel
[2:51:07] said unto Jesse are here all thy
[2:51:10] children here we go and he said there
[2:51:13] remain yet the youngest and behold he
[2:51:17] keepeth the Sheep and Samuel said unto
[2:51:20] Jesse send and fetch him now the word
[2:51:23] fetch mean to go get and bring it
[2:51:26] back to go get and bring back keep that
[2:51:30] in
[2:51:31] mind kind of remind me of myself we was
[2:51:35] I was lost in the world but God sent the
[2:51:37] Holy Ghost to come get
[2:51:38] [Applause]
[2:51:40] me he came and got me cuz I was not
[2:51:44] looking for him so he came and got me
[2:51:46] and brought me back
[2:51:53] so he sent and brought him in now he was
[2:51:56] a Rudy and wither of a beautiful
[2:51:59] continence and and goodly to look to and
[2:52:01] the Lord said
[2:52:02] arise anoint him for this is he that's
[2:52:07] right now I was back there happy when I
[2:52:10] heard brother poar talked about the
[2:52:12] sanctification now I'm going ask you a
[2:52:14] question was David there when the other
[2:52:17] seven sons got sanctified
[2:52:20] he was not there he he came in and and
[2:52:24] immediately got
[2:52:25] anointed but God knew what kind of heart
[2:52:28] he had he had a heart after
[2:52:31] [Applause]
[2:52:37] God so it's kind of it's kind of like
[2:52:40] when when before you get your conversion
[2:52:42] you you have like signs of of of of
[2:52:45] being a Christian you know you you're
[2:52:47] doing world things but every now and
[2:52:49] then it's like a glitch in the system
[2:52:51] you you have a thought that that a
[2:52:53] sinner don't think you know you don't
[2:52:55] catch it at the time and you know you
[2:52:57] just thought it was a random thought but
[2:52:58] no that that's that seed on the inside
[2:53:01] and it's and it's a deep calling to the
[2:53:03] Deep see you don't understand what
[2:53:05] what's pulling on you at that point and
[2:53:07] and you you continue to still be out
[2:53:09] there and be a sinner but every now and
[2:53:10] then that that seed that that seed will
[2:53:12] pull on you it it'll pull on you and and
[2:53:16] I'm one that I was in the world I used
[2:53:18] to to the clubs but when I got to the
[2:53:20] club sometimes I would feel myself with
[2:53:22] my back up against the wall say what am
[2:53:24] I doing here and and and everybody else
[2:53:27] having a good time but I'm like what am
[2:53:28] I doing here and and I realized that was
[2:53:30] that seed working the whole time see God
[2:53:34] always work on the chosen ones he don't
[2:53:37] just start from day one he's always
[2:53:39] working on you you just don't know he
[2:53:42] working on you yet
[2:53:49] then Samuel took the Horn of oil
[2:53:51] anointed him in the midst of his
[2:53:53] Brethren and the spirit of the Lord Came
[2:53:55] Upon David from that day forth so Samuel
[2:53:58] rose up and went to Remar let's go to
[2:54:01] chapter
[2:54:05] 17 uh
[2:54:08] verse verse 32 let's jump down chapter
[2:54:11] 17 verse 32 in the same chapter 1st
[2:54:13] Samuel 17:32
[2:54:20] but I want what I want you to draw
[2:54:21] before I read that is
[2:54:24] that God was the one that chose David
[2:54:27] amen the the prophet tried to the make
[2:54:30] the CH the choice the father tried to
[2:54:33] make the choice but God stepped in and
[2:54:36] made a choice of what he
[2:54:39] wanted so verse 32 it says and David
[2:54:43] said to Saul let no man's heart fail
[2:54:48] because of him now this this is this is
[2:54:50] the period of time when Goliath that's
[2:54:52] right he's out there running his mouth
[2:54:55] like I like to say talking about talking
[2:54:58] about the God the Living
[2:55:00] God he said let no man's heart fail
[2:55:03] because of him thy servant will go and
[2:55:05] fight with this
[2:55:07] Philistine and Saul said to David thou
[2:55:10] are not able to go against this
[2:55:12] Philistine to fight with him for thou
[2:55:15] are but a youth you're just a youth how
[2:55:17] you going to fight fight this
[2:55:19] man and he's a man he was he's a man of
[2:55:22] war from his youth so here you are a
[2:55:24] youth and you trying to fight this grown
[2:55:27] man that's been a man a man of war since
[2:55:29] your
[2:55:33] age verse 34 and David said in the
[2:55:38] sa now this this scripture here I love
[2:55:41] cuz David getting ready to testify yes
[2:55:43] sir he said thy servant kept his
[2:55:45] father's
[2:55:46] sheep and there came a lion and a bear
[2:55:51] and took a lamb out of the
[2:55:53] flock and I went out after him and
[2:55:55] smoked him and delivered it out of his
[2:55:58] mouth and when he arose against me I
[2:56:02] caught him by his beard and smoked him
[2:56:03] and slew him so let me tell you what
[2:56:06] your servant did thy servant slew both
[2:56:09] The Lion and the bear and this some
[2:56:12] circumcised filstein shall be as one of
[2:56:14] them see if he had defiled the armies of
[2:56:16] the Living God
[2:56:20] so what I'm saying he was already
[2:56:23] working on David Through The Lion and
[2:56:24] the bear David had no question in his
[2:56:27] mind that God wasn't with him God God
[2:56:30] had put him through tests through trials
[2:56:34] he knew God was with him so Goliath was
[2:56:36] just another test to David so you need
[2:56:39] to take that impli to your own life take
[2:56:42] every test you done been through take
[2:56:44] every trial that you done been through
[2:56:46] and when the next one come you just look
[2:56:48] back in the past and say if he delivered
[2:56:50] me from this if he healed me before if
[2:56:54] he made a way before surely he's able to
[2:56:57] do it
[2:56:58] again he's more than
[2:57:00] [Applause]
[2:57:05] able see every every test prepares you
[2:57:09] for the next
[2:57:10] test and and and and if you ever noticed
[2:57:14] the devil will always remind you of your
[2:57:17] past but won't tell you what God did for
[2:57:19] you in the
[2:57:20] [Applause]
[2:57:21] past he he'll tell you about your whole
[2:57:24] past but he will not remind you what God
[2:57:26] did for you because he know if you can
[2:57:29] ever look back and see what God did for
[2:57:31] you there's nothing that can handle you
[2:57:33] in front of you he knows
[2:57:36] [Applause]
[2:57:43] that so we need to let every every
[2:57:46] scriptures is inspired said so so every
[2:57:49] every story in the Bible is inspired so
[2:57:52] this this story not is just not for
[2:57:54] David it's not about Jesse you know when
[2:57:58] when it when it come down to the tests
[2:58:00] and the trial that he been through I put
[2:58:01] Tony in there I put Tony in there Lord
[2:58:05] you heal you heal me before and and now
[2:58:07] I'm facing another battle surely you
[2:58:10] able to do it again so you you got to
[2:58:13] plug yourself in the
[2:58:16] scripture don't don't don't just look at
[2:58:18] it as a story to read plug yourself in
[2:58:21] the scripture and let and let the
[2:58:22] scripture work for
[2:58:24] you but based on the chosen
[2:58:27] ones my words to you before this year
[2:58:30] end is we must be about the father's
[2:58:38] business you been chosen but what what
[2:58:41] have you been chosen
[2:58:43] for to be a
[2:58:46] Christian you've been chosen to be a
[2:58:48] Christian and a Christian is about the
[2:58:49] father's business so we don't have time
[2:58:51] to do nothing but be about the father's
[2:58:53] business God bless
[2:58:56] [Applause]
[2:59:00] [Music]
[2:59:10] yise God praise God so you discover a
[2:59:14] new preacher tonight sister Katrina he
[2:59:18] deserve a big
[2:59:19] [Applause]
[2:59:26] steak I'm
[2:59:28] sorry the last get the best so you're
[2:59:31] going to get the last best 10
[2:59:34] minutes brother set coming in 10
[2:59:42] minutes remember to look at me praise
[2:59:46] God Amen
[2:59:49] Lord help this Inspire 10 minutes amen
[2:59:53] amen can we be up standing amen want to
[2:59:57] take Hallelujah the word from
[3:00:01] Philippians
[3:00:10] 4:4 Philippians
[3:00:12] 4:4 I know we already know that
[3:00:15] scripture
[3:00:18] it
[3:00:19] says rejoice in the Lord am
[3:00:23] always and
[3:00:25] again I say rejoice amen may the Lord
[3:00:31] have his blessings to this word amen can
[3:00:33] we be seated tonight amen
[3:00:36] amen as the Pastor said it's 10 minutes
[3:00:39] and we're going to be done in 10 minutes
[3:00:41] amen amen so Bible says rejoice in the
[3:00:45] lord
[3:00:46] always and I I just love the fact that
[3:00:50] there is an
[3:00:51] end a ND the prophet said it's a
[3:00:57] conjunction the end continues always so
[3:01:01] it means there is no e n d to the A and
[3:01:05] [Applause]
[3:01:06] D the rejoicing is a
[3:01:09] loop when one is done it starts another
[3:01:12] one so there is no way you can rejoice
[3:01:16] and stop it said rejoice in the lord
[3:01:20] always it didn't say rejoice when I have
[3:01:23] money or rejoice when I have a car but
[3:01:26] it said rejoice in the lord always and
[3:01:30] again I say rejoice so no matter the
[3:01:32] situation that comes in our lives he
[3:01:35] said
[3:01:39] Rejoice amen and amen amen we want to
[3:01:43] take this from Psalm 33
[3:01:49] amen amen trying to put it together in
[3:01:52] 10 minutes
[3:01:55] amen Psalm 33 verse
[3:02:00] one it says rejoice in the Lord oh ye
[3:02:05] righteous for praise is calmly for the
[3:02:10] upright now when you look at the word
[3:02:12] calmly it it talks about
[3:02:16] beauty now
[3:02:20] amen so there is something about
[3:02:23] rejoicing that makes the upright
[3:02:26] beautiful
[3:02:27] right and when something is beautiful it
[3:02:31] brings an
[3:02:34] attraction so it is the attraction that
[3:02:37] a man sees in a woman that makes him
[3:02:40] love her there something that
[3:02:43] pulls there a pooling
[3:02:45] amen so I want to take
[3:02:48] [Applause]
[3:02:51] amen I want to take verse 10 just to
[3:02:53] skip amen the same Psalm 33:10 it said
[3:02:58] the Lord verse 9 sorry for he spake and
[3:03:03] it was done am he commanded and he stood
[3:03:08] fast so the Lord already spake it is a
[3:03:12] past tense and he said it was
[3:03:15] done for this cause we have to
[3:03:18] Rejoice so it is not starting now it was
[3:03:22] already ended that is why he said and
[3:03:25] again I say rejoice rejoice in the lord
[3:03:28] always and Bible says rejoicing is an
[3:03:32] attraction it's a beauty for the upright
[3:03:35] now I want to take a quote from the
[3:03:38] prophet Lord help
[3:03:45] me amen and amen
[3:03:51] I don't know if if we got it now um show
[3:03:54] us the
[3:03:56] father now I said show us the father
[3:03:59] said and then when Jesus Christ spoke
[3:04:02] these
[3:04:04] words they never
[3:04:07] die SS claims in 20 years we was
[3:04:11] speaking in 63 in 20 years from now they
[3:04:13] can pick up the literal
[3:04:16] voice they will be able to pick up the
[3:04:18] literal voice of Jesus and the prophet
[3:04:21] said is still in the
[3:04:23] earth whatever the Lord had already
[3:04:26] promised his bright is still here and it
[3:04:30] says CU see it's a sending
[3:04:35] post and I love that comma there it said
[3:04:38] you
[3:04:39] are so Christ is ascending post and he
[3:04:44] also says you are also a sending post
[3:04:50] amen so my message tonight is a sending
[3:04:54] post and a receiving
[3:04:57] post so said then there has to be a
[3:05:00] receiving
[3:05:02] post now said and if you can be the
[3:05:06] receptacle what is a receptacle a
[3:05:08] receptacle is something that receive
[3:05:10] something onto itself it said and if you
[3:05:14] can be the receptacle see receiving post
[3:05:17] to receive the word of God then it's
[3:05:20] real to you and it's it will live just
[3:05:24] like it was then whatever Christ was
[3:05:28] then the prophet said he spoke the word
[3:05:31] and he still living today and when we
[3:05:34] are receiving post and it manifest to us
[3:05:37] it will be the same word that he spoke
[3:05:41] then amen amen so what does rejoicing do
[3:05:46] rejoicing is an attraction to the word
[3:05:49] of God a receiving post must have an
[3:05:53] attraction so whatever promise the Lord
[3:05:56] said when I take it up and I said this
[3:05:59] is what the Lord said and I'm
[3:06:02] rejoicing it is receiving what the Lord
[3:06:05] has already
[3:06:07] posted and God said you are also a
[3:06:11] sending post so I will send the post and
[3:06:15] I also receive the post
[3:06:17] that is why I said ye are Gods so God
[3:06:21] had to create the word by by by by by
[3:06:25] speaking and when he spoke the word he
[3:06:28] had to believe it so believing is also a
[3:06:31] way of receiving whatever he spoke and
[3:06:34] God made us in his own image
[3:06:39] amen amen and
[3:06:42] amen oh Lord
[3:06:44] Jesus let me let me just keep all this
[3:06:47] quotes and do this last one amen
[3:06:52] wonderful this is from um Revelations
[3:06:55] chapter 4 part
[3:06:57] two
[3:06:59] amen he said bra Bram is saying
[3:07:01] something said I've
[3:07:04] noticed this in my own little humble
[3:07:07] Ministry that there's many times that I
[3:07:11] will say something and not know why I
[3:07:14] said it and it don't look right
[3:07:18] but here somebody will say something but
[3:07:21] I will
[3:07:22] watch and that thing will just come as
[3:07:26] perfect around to that as it can
[3:07:29] come God will make it happen BR said for
[3:07:33] some reason sometimes he say certain
[3:07:35] things and he doesn't know why he said
[3:07:38] it but then he'll be watching around and
[3:07:41] then he realize that it came to pass
[3:07:43] that's right he said when I just want to
[3:07:46] say something I'll say well now wait a
[3:07:48] minute that guy so this to happen over
[3:07:51] here now that just has to be that way
[3:07:54] well really I don't know why I said it
[3:07:56] and the first thing you know is just
[3:07:58] that way God does it am amen so let let
[3:08:03] me take the he said now when these
[3:08:06] disciples had said there was a time
[3:08:08] where Peter was I believe I have some
[3:08:10] few minutes so there's a time where
[3:08:13] Christ was talking to Peter sir and then
[3:08:16] Peter was like I'm just trying to
[3:08:18] summarize it he said what about this man
[3:08:20] John that's right and then Jesus I'm
[3:08:24] just paraphrasing he said um don't
[3:08:26] really think about John whatever is
[3:08:28] going to happen uh it doesn't matter
[3:08:30] whether he T till like come and all
[3:08:33] that just think about yourself just
[3:08:37] follow me yes sir and then now the
[3:08:41] prophet is
[3:08:42] saying Jesus said so he said now when
[3:08:45] these disciples have said oh Jesus said
[3:08:47] this this man Wouldn't Die Jesus never
[3:08:49] said that that's what the Bible said
[3:08:52] that the people the disciples Mis
[3:08:55] interpreted what Jesus was saying about
[3:08:57] John so said Jesus said what is it to
[3:09:00] you if he lives till I
[3:09:03] come so the prophet is saying but to see
[3:09:06] the disciples making a saying of it
[3:09:09] there was an easing amen that were going
[3:09:12] on then Jesus reached down and took J on
[3:09:18] and brought him up and let him rehearse
[3:09:20] the whole thing oh my God see the
[3:09:24] rehearsal of the coming of the Lord so
[3:09:27] the disciples were saying that John will
[3:09:29] not die that was the easing that was
[3:09:32] going on but the Bible said Jesus never
[3:09:34] said that and the prophet said because
[3:09:37] the people were saying that God had to
[3:09:40] take John and
[3:09:45] rehearse exactly so whatever we are
[3:09:49] saying about our lives even if it was a
[3:09:54] mistake God will take
[3:09:57] it and bring it to
[3:10:00] [Applause]

[3:16:20] Worship the Lord
[3:16:22] Jesus let's read a portion of the
[3:16:24] scriptures and just uh say few things to
[3:16:28] add to what we be said the Lord is good
[3:16:31] let's read from
[3:16:32] Matthew yes Matthew Chapter
[3:16:37] 2 about this season that we are in
[3:16:43] amen why are we here because we have
[3:16:46] seen this
[3:16:49] and we are here to worship
[3:16:52] Him Matthew 2
[3:16:55] sir now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem
[3:16:59] of Judea in the days of erod the king
[3:17:03] behold there came wise men from the East
[3:17:06] to
[3:17:07] Jerusalem saying where is he that is
[3:17:10] born King of the Jews for we have seen a
[3:17:14] star in the east yes sir and I come to

[3:17:36] past and bless our
[3:17:38] future to be more like you Lord Jesus to

[3:18:11] are looking forward you know it's Grace
[3:18:14] that has brought us this far and uh the
[3:18:18] same Grace will take us through so let's
[3:18:21] keep on holding on to the word of the
[3:18:24] Lord all that we have been hearing is
[3:18:27] building us is preparing us for what is
[3:18:30] ahead of us so as we enter the year
[3:18:33] remember this thing that we have heard
[3:18:35] yes sir from Brother Kelly coming to
[3:18:37] minister to us and the brother follows
[3:18:41] and abet and so remember the word of the
[3:18:45] Lord and I'm grateful that the Bible
[3:18:47] says that the word of the Lord will not
[3:18:51] be in vain as the scripture says the
[3:18:54] word that has gone out of my mouth God
[3:18:56] said will never return unto me
[3:18:59] void it will serve his purpose so we are
[3:19:02] not here by chance amen so just a little
[3:19:05] to speak and encourage us we are here to
[3:19:08] Worship the Lord am God is an object of
[3:19:12] worship and that's what we are made so
[3:19:15] as said yes read it h Rejoice again I
[3:19:19] say rejoice and so we saw this wise men
[3:19:23] the Bible called him wise men because
[3:19:25] every wise man will follow the word of
[3:19:29] God Amen and remember this amen ah this
[3:19:35] men were astrologers or whatever they
[3:19:38] call them were taught in the scripture
[3:19:41] they were studying sir until they saw
[3:19:44] this unique sty this constellation and
[3:19:47] remember not everybody saw
[3:19:49] it God reveal it to
[3:19:52] them amen so Jesus said thank God for
[3:19:55] your eyes for they see and your ears for
[3:19:58] they hear because it is not given to
[3:20:01] everybody so if it is given to us we
[3:20:04] should be
[3:20:06] [Music]
[3:20:07] rejoicing because it is not what we
[3:20:10] learn it is Grace that give these things
[3:20:13] to us and so these brothers or this man
[3:20:17] and they saw that star and they look at
[3:20:20] there were many others that were
[3:20:22] studying the stars but it was revealed
[3:20:25] to this Breen this man and just for you
[3:20:29] to remember they have to travel for
[3:20:32] almost 2 years that's right and they
[3:20:35] were not driving on the super highways
[3:20:38] they were traveling in the
[3:20:40] night in the
[3:20:43] night because the stars appears in the
[3:20:45] night
[3:20:47] amen so the night they take follow that
[3:20:50] star so God send Seven Stars the stars
[3:20:54] appears in the night when teachers and
[3:20:57] theologians have gone astray then the
[3:20:59] star comes to give us the light to show
[3:21:03] us the path so remember to follow the
[3:21:06] star Hallelujah so remember they have to
[3:21:09] follow the star for almost 2 years and
[3:21:13] they had a problem on the way when they
[3:21:16] leave on their own
[3:21:18] understanding when they see oh we are
[3:21:21] now in the big city we don't need a star
[3:21:24] again and so let us let us go and find
[3:21:27] out from these people
[3:21:29] here so when you you you overlook the
[3:21:33] star you get
[3:21:37] confused you get
[3:21:39] confused when they miss that start they
[3:21:42] okay now we want to think on our ways I
[3:21:45] mean Reon yet I think it should be this
[3:21:47] I I think we are in Jerusalem so it
[3:21:50] should be here and there and then they
[3:21:52] almost lost their
[3:21:55] [Music]
[3:21:57] lives they got
[3:21:59] confused so keep your eyes on the star I
[3:22:02] mean don't try to reason don't try to
[3:22:05] reason and think oh maybe the star no no
[3:22:08] no the star LED them for 2
[3:22:12] years watch the
[3:22:15] star and because that star was sh today
[3:22:18] for a purpose it was revealed today and
[3:22:20] when God reveals something to us it is
[3:22:22] for a purpose
[3:22:26] that's amen and so they have to travel
[3:22:29] all these years on here and there and
[3:22:32] okay they came to Jerusalem oh
[3:22:34] Hallelujah when they came they said they
[3:22:36] were
[3:22:38] shouting why is he that is born King of
[3:22:42] the Jews why is he that is born and the
[3:22:46] Mage St the whole city where is he that
[3:22:50] is born and listen this men were
[3:22:56] Nobles so it does not matter your
[3:22:58] education and your qualification and
[3:23:01] your dressing no when God is revealed to
[3:23:04] you it becomes an anchor you cannot keep
[3:23:09] quiet you'll be rejoicing night and

[3:23:27] ashamed to

[3:23:51] saw the star Hallelujah and that shows
[3:23:54] that is born it's

[3:29:14] ideas they saw the star again
[3:29:18] they left the star but the star was
[3:29:20] waiting for

[3:38:11] bless us in such a way and then we'll go
[3:38:15] back out and say oh very nice
[3:38:18] meeting now the preaching of the word we
[3:38:22] enjoy it but that's not the main thing
[3:38:26] that's not we should not Worship the
[3:38:29] Lord Jesus or Worship the Lord just
[3:38:32] after we get through preaching the
[3:38:35] word as we usually do just worship him
[3:38:39] sir that's wonderful but we should
[3:38:42] worship him every hour of of Our
[3:38:48] Lives when we are at work we should
[3:38:52] worship him every time the opportunity
[3:38:55] present
[3:38:57] itself Worship the Lord by testifying of
[3:39:02] [Applause]
[3:39:07] him

[3:39:13] ladies see a woman
[3:39:16] in the wrong Worship the Lord by taking
[3:39:19] air and saying sister there is a better
[3:39:23] life than

[3:39:45] you there is a better life than this you
[3:39:49] shouldn't use those words and tell him
[3:39:53] in a mi Gentle Way all those things is a
[3:40:01] worship and when we see someone sick and
[3:40:05] the doctor says there is no more can be
[3:40:08] done we ought to Worship the Lord by
[3:40:12] telling them there is a God of Heaven
[3:40:16] that answers prayer and then when we see
[3:40:20] those things take place and we do see
[3:40:23] take place and then we should never let

[3:42:59] Lord's Supper amen you heard what the
[3:43:02] Lord
[3:43:03] says we usually like I say when we get
[3:43:07] in this message we need to be
[3:43:09] reprogrammed because when we say worship
[3:43:11] the first thing that come in our mind is
[3:43:13] lift up hand which is true which is a
[3:43:15] part of worship amen there is more to
[3:43:19] worship than that worshiping the Lord
[3:43:21] with your life that is a service of
[3:43:25] worship unto the Lord amen praise be to
[3:43:29] the name of the Lord amen amen amen
[3:43:33] glory to God don't be on hurry let's

[3:43:39] read the quote so it's going to help
[3:43:41] you brother brandham says this
[3:43:46] if you want the cot I can send it to you
[3:43:48] later it's in the message
[3:43:51] communion brother Bram says this if I'm
[3:43:54] not mistaken brother Bram say this in
[3:43:56] paragraph 73 do you know that communion
[3:44:00] has Divine Healing in
[3:44:02] it if you need this quote I will show
[3:44:05] you I will send it to
[3:44:08] you amen there are three ordinances
[3:44:12] brother Bram call that three orders that
[3:44:15] the Lord
[3:44:16] left amen it's foot washing water
[3:44:21] baptism and then communion brother Bram
[3:44:24] say those three are
[3:44:26] Perfection I have the quote where he
[3:44:28] says that amen so this is very important
[3:44:31] you have a whole year yes without the
[3:44:34] Lord's
[3:44:35] Supper technically speaking everybody
[3:44:37] should be here right because brother
[3:44:39] Bram called this a showdown and brother
[3:44:42] Bram says that it's a duty of a
[3:44:44] Christian to take it but we usually take
[3:44:47] it as an act don't even realize what it
[3:44:50] is this was done over there in type when
[3:44:54] Israel was leaving
[3:44:55] Egypt and that's why brother Bram is
[3:44:58] saying I'm going to read it again he
[3:45:00] says do you know that communion have
[3:45:03] Divine Healing in it when the Israelite
[3:45:07] in the type took the communion and
[3:45:10] marched 40 years and when they came out
[3:45:13] of the wilderness there was not a feeble
[3:45:17] one among them two and a half million
[3:45:21] people there is power of healing in the
[3:45:26] communion everybody is welcome
[3:45:31] now there is power of healing in what we
[3:45:34] doing here amen so let's

[3:48:25] God 1 Corinthian chapter
[3:48:29] 11 glory to
[3:48:34] God if you dare you can say
[3:48:38] Amen verse
[3:48:40] 23 the Bible says this that for I have
[3:48:45] receive of the Lord that which also I
[3:48:48] delivered unto you so Paul received this
[3:48:51] from the Lord amen that the Lord Jesus
[3:48:55] the same night in which he was betrayed
[3:48:59] he took bread and when he has given
[3:49:02] thanks he breaks it he break it and say
[3:49:07] take it this is my body which is broken
[3:49:11] for you this do in in remembrance of me
[3:49:16] so it's a
[3:49:18] commandment the Bible says in verse 25
[3:49:21] and after the same man also he took the
[3:49:25] cup when he had sap saying this cup is
[3:49:29] the New Testament in my
[3:49:32] blood this do ye as of as ye drink it in
[3:49:39] remembrance of me it's a
[3:49:41] commandment for as often as he eat this
[3:49:45] bread and drink this cup ye do show the
[3:49:48] Lord's death until he
[3:49:51] come amen wherefore whatsoever shall eat
[3:49:56] this bread and drink this cup of the
[3:49:58] Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the
[3:50:01] body of the and the blood of the Lord
[3:50:05] but let en let a man examine himself and
[3:50:09] let him eat of that bread and drink of
[3:50:11] that cup for he that eateth and drinketh
[3:50:14] worly eateth and drinketh Damnation to
[3:50:17] himself not Discerning the Lord's body
[3:50:21] which is the briad for this cause many
[3:50:24] are weak and sickly among you and many
[3:50:28] sleep so those who took that unly got
[3:50:32] consequences they are sick and some died
[3:50:36] but if it cause trouble to those that
[3:50:39] took it unw worly what about those that
[3:50:42] took it worly they got to be something
[3:50:45] done to them also your worthiness is not
[3:50:49] on your brain your worthiness will be
[3:50:53] always centering in
[3:50:55] Calvary in other words you might have
[3:50:57] sinned this morning you might have get
[3:50:59] upset this morning but put everything
[3:51:01] under the blood you can never approach
[3:51:04] here without the blood no matter how
[3:51:06] much you think that you I woke up in the
[3:51:08] morning I have not done anything now I
[3:51:10] feel like I'm in tle I will never
[3:51:13] approach the Lord serer like that I will
[3:51:15] always plead the blood and pray God that
[3:51:18] maybe something per Adventure I did
[3:51:21] something that was wrong but if I'm
[3:51:22] approaching this not because of me but
[3:51:25] because of Calvary because of the blood
[3:51:28] it's your blood that made us worthy to
[3:51:30] be able to even take the book from his
[3:51:33] hand and eat the book The Bible says
[3:51:36] that for this cause are
[3:51:39] many uh many are weak and sickly among
[3:51:42] you and many sleep for if you would
[3:51:44] judge
[3:51:45] if we would judge ourself we should not
[3:51:46] be judged but when we are judged we are
[3:51:49] chest of the Lord that that we should
[3:51:52] not be condemned with the world
[3:51:54] wherefore my brethren when ye come
[3:51:56] together to eat ter one for the other
[3:52:00] and if any man hunger let him eat her
[3:52:02] home that she come not together unto
[3:52:05] condemnation and the rest will I said in

[4:10:52] amen if you finish you can grab your
[4:10:55] bible in the Book of John
[4:11:01] chapter John
[4:11:05] 13 usually as pastor we will receive a
[4:11:09] bazillion messages so I'm already saying
[4:11:13] to everybody Happy New Year in case I
[4:11:16] don't respond to your message Happy New
[4:11:21] Year amen let's go to John Chapter
[4:11:26] 13 I believe we can get a little bit of
[4:11:29] time to do the feet washing then we read
[4:11:33] couple quotes and we let you go home but
[4:11:36] you made
[4:11:37] it amen amen praise God brother brandham
[4:11:42] says
[4:11:44] in this message he says in paragraph uh
[4:11:49] 91 preach on
[4:11:51] 1962 November the 4th in the evening
[4:11:55] brother brandham say some people try to
[4:11:58] say it's not
[4:12:00] necessary certainly I don't mean to say
[4:12:03] that people's feet need washing that is
[4:12:06] not it maybe theirs did not either but
[4:12:10] it was an act of humility
[4:12:13] amen
[4:12:15] amen it's an act of doing just as
[4:12:19] essential as water
[4:12:23] baptism this is the prophet if you want
[4:12:25] all this quote I'll put it in the chat
[4:12:28] amen because he has said here that I
[4:12:32] have given you an example that you
[4:12:35] should do to each other as I have done
[4:12:39] to you as we found out that a widow
[4:12:43] could not be brought into in among the
[4:12:46] people unless she had lodged strangers
[4:12:49] and had washed the feet of the saint
[4:12:52] showing ourselves humble so let's take a
[4:12:56] little bit of time and go through John
[4:12:58] Chapter 13 and do it this is the only
[4:13:02] time of the year you can do it
[4:13:05] amen now before the Feast of
[4:13:08] Passover verse one when Jesus knew that
[4:13:11] the his hour was coming that he should
[4:13:13] depart out of the world out of this
[4:13:15] world unto the father having loved his
[4:13:18] own which were in the world he loved
[4:13:21] them unto the end and supper being ended
[4:13:25] the devil have now put into the heart of
[4:13:29] Judas is kariot Simon's son to betray
[4:13:32] him Jesus knowing that the father has
[4:13:35] given all things into his hand and that
[4:13:38] he was come from God and went to God do
[4:13:43] you know how the devil entered
[4:13:48] Judah it was by giving
[4:13:51] communion because Judah was not
[4:13:54] chosen but if you are chosen and you get
[4:13:58] communion into to you what do you think
[4:14:00] can
[4:14:02] happen oh glory to God he says verse
[4:14:07] four he he riseth from supper and laid
[4:14:11] aside His Garment and took a towel and
[4:14:14] GED himself after that he poured water
[4:14:17] into a basin and began to wash the
[4:14:21] disciples feet and to wipe them with the
[4:14:24] tower wherewith he was
[4:14:27] GED then cometh him to Simon Peter and
[4:14:30] Peter say unto him Lord do thou wash my
[4:14:35] feet Jesus answered and say unto him
[4:14:38] what I do that knowest not now but thou
[4:14:41] shall know here after Peter say unto him
[4:14:45] thou shall never wash my feet Jesus
[4:14:47] answered him if I wash thee not thou has
[4:14:51] no part with me do you see how important
[4:14:54] it
[4:14:55] is Simon Peter say unto him Lord not my
[4:14:59] feet only but also my hands and my head
[4:15:02] Jesus said to him he that is washed
[4:15:04] needed not Sav to wash his feet but is
[4:15:08] clean every weight and ye are clean but
[4:15:11] not all for he knew who should betray
[4:15:14] him therefore said he ye are not all
[4:15:17] clean so after he had washed their feet
[4:15:20] and had taken His Garment and he was set
[4:15:23] down again he said unto them know ye
[4:15:26] what I have done to you ye call me
[4:15:29] master and Lord and he say well for so I
[4:15:32] am and if I then your Lord and Master
[4:15:37] have washed your feet ye also ought to
[4:15:41] wash one another's feet it's a m that's
[4:15:45] why brother Bram say it's a
[4:15:47] humility amen because technically if he
[4:15:50] was the master he was the disciple to
[4:15:53] wash his feet but he's the one doing it
[4:15:56] and the Bible say verily verily I say
[4:15:59] unto you the servant is no greater than
[4:16:01] his Lord neither he that is sent greater
[4:16:04] than he that sent
[4:16:06] him if ye know these
[4:16:09] things happy are ye not if you
[4:16:15] know watch the scripture if you know
[4:16:17] these things it's good to know but happy
[4:16:20] are ye if you do
[4:16:23] them so there is a blessing that goes
[4:16:27] with doing
[4:16:29] this so the sister will remain here in
[4:16:31] the sanctuary and the brother will go
[4:16:34] right
[4:16:35] there
[4:16:37] until we get a signal from the sister
[4:16:40] that all is done let's do this and we
[4:16:42] come back and we read couple quotes and
[4:16:45] we pray amen praise
[4:17:11] God
[4:17:41] for
[4:18:11] for for
