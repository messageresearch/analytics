[18:38] the congregation may be
[18:49] seated praise
[18:52] God we greet you all in the precious
[18:55] name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ
[18:57] and on behalf of the families and the
[19:00] church we welcome you to this marriage
[19:03] ceremony joining Joseph and Josephine
[19:07] Wilson I will now invite you to the
[19:10] reading of the
[19:12] scripture my scripture will be in
[19:14] Genesis very familiar
[19:17] scripture chapter 1 verse 25 all the way
[19:21] to
[19:23] 26 the Bible says in verse 25 and God
[19:28] made the Beast of the earth after his
[19:31] kind and the cattle after their kind and
[19:35] everything that creth upon the Earth
[19:38] after his kind and God so that he was
[19:43] good and God say let us not let
[19:48] me let us when you say us it means it's
[19:52] more than one person God say let us make
[19:56] men in our
[19:59] image after our likeness and let
[20:03] them have dominion over the fish of the
[20:07] sea and over the foul of the air and
[20:10] over the cattle and over all the Earth
[20:13] and over every creeping thing that
[20:16] creepeth upon the Earth so God created
[20:22] man in his own
[20:24] image in the image of God created he him
[20:30] male and
[20:32] female created he them so man even
[20:38] though it's singular it's
[20:41] plural man is male and female according
[20:47] to the scripture
[20:48] amen and in verse 28 the Bible say and
[20:52] God bless
[20:53] them and say unto them not unto him unto
[20:58] them
[20:59] he say be fruitful and multiply and
[21:03] replenish the Earth and subdue it and
[21:06] have dominion over the fish of the sea
[21:09] and over the foul of the air and over
[21:12] every living thing that moveth upon the
[21:16] Earth in Genesis 5 verse 1 the Bible
[21:22] says the same thing about this uh event
[21:25] here of the creation of man the Bible
[21:28] says in verse one this is the book of
[21:30] the generations of Adam in the day that
[21:34] God created man M an singular in the
[21:39] likeness of God made he him male and
[21:43] female created he them and blessed them
[21:48] and called their name
[21:50] Adam so Adam is not a name of man
[21:56] only according to the scripture when God
[21:59] say Adam he's calling both a male and a
[22:03] female together but God didn't say
[22:08] Adams not a plural he say Adam because
[22:11] both of them are one the Bible say he
[22:14] called their name Adam in the day when
[22:19] they were created now my subject in the
[22:24] next few minutes is the restoration
[22:27] marriage and as the restoration of the
[22:30] complete
[22:32] image marriage as the restoration of the
[22:36] complete image in Genesis
[22:39] 2:7 the Bible says that and the Lord God
[22:43] form men not created because God already
[22:46] created man in Genesis 1:26 and the man
[22:50] that was created in
[22:52] genesis6 was a spirit because the Bible
[22:55] say in the Book of John chapter 4 that
[22:58] God is a spirit and those that worship
[23:01] Him must worship Him in spirit and in
[23:03] the truth and in Genesis 2:7 the Bible
[23:07] says and the Lord God formed Men Out of
[23:10] the Dust of the ground and breathed into
[23:13] his nostril the breath of life and Man
[23:17] became a living Soul surprisingly in
[23:21] Genesis 2 when God created man we only
[23:24] see a man a male there was there was no
[23:28] female there while in Genesis 1: 126
[23:32] when he created man there was a female
[23:35] and a male but in Genesis 2 we we saw
[23:38] one entity only appearing which was a
[23:41] man and in Genesis 2 Verse 18 the Bible
[23:46] says and the Lord God say it was not man
[23:49] it's God who said and the Lord God say
[23:52] it is not good that man should be alone
[23:58] I will make him a help made for him the
[24:03] question is if it's not good for man to
[24:06] be alone who created man
[24:11] alone it was God himself that created
[24:14] man alone so if God knew that it was not
[24:17] good for man to be alone why did he
[24:21] created man alone to begin
[24:24] with did he make a
[24:26] mistake God forbid
[24:29] amen the Bible says in Isaiah
[24:33] 46:10 that God declared the end from the
[24:36] beginning in other words God knows
[24:38] everything and according to Isaiah
[24:41] 55:8 the Bible say for my thoughts are
[24:45] not your thoughts neither are your ways
[24:48] my ways say the Lord so God when he does
[24:52] things there is a mystery connected to
[24:54] it there is a message there is something
[24:56] that is hidden behind it that's why Paul
[24:59] in Roman
[25:00] 11:33 Paul say oh the depths of the
[25:04] riches both of the wisdom and the
[25:07] knowledge of God how unsearchable are
[25:10] his judgment and his way past finding
[25:13] out God hide these things to the wise
[25:17] and to The Prudent and God will reveal
[25:20] his secret to babes such as we want to
[25:24] learn why did God create male in Genesis
[25:30] 2 one entity instead of two because in
[25:34] the beginning when God was creating
[25:37] everything that God made was a pair in
[25:40] the message marriage and divorce
[25:43] preaching in
[25:44] 1965 in February the 21st in the morning
[25:48] in paragraph 91 brother Bram say if
[25:51] Jesus say go back to the beginning there
[25:54] was only one pair of anything on Earth
[25:58] there was one Adam one Eve they were
[26:02] join by God Alone one female horse one
[26:06] male one female parot one male at the
[26:10] beginning as he told us to go back there
[26:13] was only a pair of everything amen if
[26:17] you notice even when God wanted to
[26:19] destroy this world with water when God
[26:22] gave Noah the instruction to bring the
[26:24] animal into the ark the animal were
[26:27] brought
[26:29] male and female together are we together
[26:32] even when Samson in the time of the
[26:35] Harvest of a wheat when he wanted to
[26:37] destroy the field of the Philistine the
[26:40] bible say that Samson went and he caught
[26:43] 300 foxes and he divided them in two and
[26:47] took two by two and he used fire brand
[26:51] and put them ta to tail and send them
[26:54] into the into the uh crop of the
[26:57] philistine in order to destroy the world
[27:00] so whatever God is looking for is to
[27:03] find two a young couple a good couple
[27:07] that God himself can join together and
[27:10] God can put the fire brand of the fire
[27:13] of the Holy Spirit and send you in this
[27:16] world and you can bring the Gospel
[27:18] wherever you going breathing out the
[27:21] spirit of the Lord and showing that
[27:23] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today
[27:26] and forever destroying the world work of
[27:28] the devil amen according to
[27:31] Ecclesiastes verse 4 that two are better
[27:35] than
[27:36] one because they have a good reward for
[27:39] their labor for if they
[27:42] fall the one will lift his fellow but
[27:46] woe this is the scripture woe to him
[27:49] that is
[27:50] alone that's why God say it is not good
[27:54] for Brother Joseph to be
[27:56] alone amen
[27:58] woe unto Brother Joseph when you are
[28:01] alone if you fall there is no one to
[28:04] help you up this help doesn't need
[28:07] Mama this help doesn't need daddy this
[28:10] help needs you in a female version he
[28:14] need a help that is meat for you and the
[28:18] Bible say woe unto him that is alone
[28:21] when he fth for he has not another to
[28:24] help him up verse 11 again if two lie
[28:30] together then they get hit but how can
[28:33] one be warm alone and if a one Prevail
[28:37] against him two shall withstand him and
[28:40] a three-fold cord is not quickly broken
[28:44] amen so man when he was created in
[28:48] Genesis 2 God created man as a male
[28:52] alone then God found out that it was not
[28:55] good for this male to be alone
[28:58] because when God called the creature the
[29:01] Beast he bring them he brought them to
[29:03] Adam he say Adam go ahead and name them
[29:06] and Adam gave name to all the creature
[29:10] that God brought unto him but there was
[29:12] no creature that Adam call woman that's
[29:16] why the scripture is against man a human
[29:19] being maing with animal because Adam
[29:23] named all the animal but he could not
[29:25] find an animal that looked like him he
[29:28] could not find a creature a creation
[29:31] that looked like him but God took Adam
[29:34] and put him to sleep let's put it
[29:36] together God took Brother Joseph and put
[29:39] him to sleep and God pulled from Brother
[29:42] Joseph a piece which is called a rib and
[29:46] begin to manufacture sister josephin and
[29:49] God brought sister josephin himself it
[29:53] is not man who brought the woman it was
[29:55] God himself that took the the woman back
[29:58] to the man because at the beginning in
[30:01] Genesis 1:26 when Man was created he was
[30:05] already male and female and if you
[30:08] notice in Genesis 1:26 there was no
[30:11] marriage ceremony because they were
[30:13] already joined together by God but in
[30:16] Genesis 2:7 because man was put in the
[30:19] flesh and separated from his briad so in
[30:22] order to keep the image of God which God
[30:25] created man in his own image male and
[30:28] female meaning that God himself is male
[30:32] and female that's why Christ himself has
[30:34] a bread in the Book of Revelation the
[30:37] Bible say come and see the Lamb's wife
[30:40] which is the brde of Jesus Christ to
[30:42] create and to keep that image that
[30:44] entity together God initiated marriage
[30:49] so what is marriage it is the bringing
[30:51] back of the two entities together what
[30:54] is marriage it is the bringing back of
[30:57] the woman back to her original position
[31:00] What is marriage it is the bringing back
[31:02] of Brother Joseph and sister Josephine
[31:05] back together as they used to be in
[31:07] eternity they came from eternity they
[31:10] step in time and they were split
[31:12] together but through the bonds of
[31:14] marriage now today brother Joseph and
[31:18] sister Josephine are going to find
[31:20] themselves back again and what God have
[31:22] joined together let no one put it as
[31:25] under it won't be two entity but he will
[31:28] be only one let's give the Lord a big
[31:30] clap
[31:32] [Applause]
[31:37] offering in the message the door inside
[31:40] the door brother Bram says this in
[31:44] paragraph 6 in preaching
[31:45] 1960 brother brandham say then I always
[31:49] have a little slogan as I say to the
[31:52] people that are married you see the
[31:55] young couple look at them young
[31:58] Amen brother Bram say you see the young
[32:01] couple and they come up before me I
[32:04] always think of Christ and his Brad the
[32:08] great wedding supper that we are all
[32:10] anxious to attend and to see them there
[32:14] they are young Youth and their brother
[32:16] eyes as they are standing there to take
[32:19] this vow to bur them through life
[32:22] Journey always say to them something
[32:24] like this now you want to be happy and
[32:29] you cannot be happy without
[32:32] Christ there is no home happy without
[32:35] Christ I just want you to show me one
[32:38] you have some make believe but you can't
[32:41] be happy without Christ and this is what
[32:44] I'm going to tell you you won't be happy
[32:46] in your marriage without Christ amen if
[32:51] you want your marriage to succeed amen
[32:54] you need to have Christ Paul says that
[32:58] those that marry will have trouble in
[33:00] the flesh it means that when you get
[33:03] married things may get tougher a little
[33:05] bit in the
[33:08] message the stature of a perfect man in
[33:12] paragraph 44 brother brandham say now
[33:16] right now before you are married
[33:18] everything is just fine and dandy but
[33:21] after you get married then the toys and
[33:24] the trials of Life come in that is when
[33:27] you got to be so in love that you
[33:30] understand one another when you are
[33:31] disappointed in her she is disappointed
[33:34] in you you still understand one another
[33:38] and my advice to the young couple the
[33:41] first miracle and the beginning of the
[33:44] miracle of Jesus Christ happen in a
[33:48] marriage in a wedding day why did christ
[33:53] choose out of every sin any event into
[33:56] the world before God begin to display
[33:59] his power in the ministry of Jesus
[34:01] Christ he only chose a wedding day
[34:04] because marriage is special before God
[34:08] Amen the bible say that Jesus was
[34:11] invited and we want Jesus to be invited
[34:13] in your marriage because a three-fold
[34:16] code cannot be easily broken amen when
[34:19] Jesus was invited and a need was found
[34:22] in the marriage Jesus provided we want
[34:25] Jesus in your marriage because there is
[34:27] no marri marriage no happiness in the
[34:29] marriage without Christ being in the
[34:31] middle amen God richly bless you that
[34:35] was the
[34:43] exaltation glory to God
[34:58] [Music]
