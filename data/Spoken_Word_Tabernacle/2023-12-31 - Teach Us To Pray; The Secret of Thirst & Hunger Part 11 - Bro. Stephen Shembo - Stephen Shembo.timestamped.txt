[33:40] and then when it came to um my exams I
[33:42] have to take two exams one practical
[33:44] which was in Raleigh um and then a
[33:47] theory exam which was 110 questions and
[33:51] um so I took the test twice because you
[33:53] have to you basically have to take both
[33:55] you have to pass both in order to um get
[33:56] get your um your um your license through
[33:58] the state so I took my test twice um and
[34:02] I failed twice it was 110 questions was
[34:05] really hard and we only had an hour and
[34:07] 30 minutes to finish it off um I was
[34:09] always that student in school that um
[34:12] would take every single minute left um
[34:14] when we had exams and tests and
[34:16] everybody was like I hurry up and finish
[34:17] the test but um so that was just
[34:19] pressure on me but um especially around
[34:22] that time the first time I took it um
[34:24] that was right after school so I kind of
[34:26] had all the material in my head so I
[34:27] tried my best and I failed it and then
[34:30] the um the second time I took it I was
[34:31] with my mom so after I took it I think I
[34:34] think I I think I took it like four
[34:35] months after that I took the exam and I
[34:38] failed again um and then after that my
[34:40] mom passed and everything so I was just
[34:42] kind of like not motivated to do
[34:43] anything and around that time um we
[34:46] basically had three limits so basically
[34:48] if you take the test the third time and
[34:49] you failed it you basically have to kind
[34:51] of go back in school again and you know
[34:53] we don't have that system again here in
[34:55] North Carolina so I have to go to like a
[34:56] l or anything or something like that and
[34:58] the school was already expensive it was
[35:00] like 10K so and I know that God um you
[35:02] know wanted me to be in this path cuz
[35:04] you because he provided the funds
[35:06] through financial AED and grants so um I
[35:09] just you know kept pressing on and then
[35:11] um so after I graduated and everything
[35:14] um I usually go back to school just to
[35:15] get like skincare products again because
[35:17] we can get skincare products discounted
[35:19] for us um so I went to the school and
[35:22] then I was talking to my administrator
[35:24] who actually became the director after
[35:27] cuz at first the one who was there
[35:28] before she told us that you know as long
[35:30] as she's that she's the director we can
[35:31] get our skin um our product discounted
[35:34] so I went to school and then I came
[35:35] there and she said oh you know the lady
[35:37] left so I was kind of disappointed I was
[35:38] like oh my God she left now I can't get
[35:40] my skincare products discounted because
[35:42] they're so expensive but then I was just
[35:44] telling her I was like oh I took the
[35:45] test twice already I failed it twice and
[35:47] then she was like oh no um don't worry
[35:49] um you know they actually took off the
[35:51] pinch and now you can take as much as
[35:52] you want and you know you won't get
[35:53] penalty for it so that was just that was
[35:55] like my the first Tes well part one kind
[35:58] of um I was very happy because that kind
[36:00] of relieved all the pressure of like you
[36:01] know the third time I take if I fell
[36:03] again then I have you know basically my
[36:05] life is over or whatever so so then um
[36:08] that definitely um helped me and and and
[36:10] motivated me to kind of you know to
[36:11] start um um practicing again and
[36:13] studying again and going over my books
[36:14] Etc and of course with the preaching of
[36:16] the word that was coming forth about
[36:18] faith and um um you know speaking um the
[36:20] word and then I was just telling myself
[36:22] over and over the third time I'm going
[36:23] to take this test the third time I'm
[36:24] goingon to take this test I'm going to
[36:25] pass I'm G to pass
[36:27] and then I remember Sister Rosemary who
[36:29] gave her testimony about taking the test
[36:30] and knowing that she failed but you know
[36:33] God you know um basically answered all
[36:34] the questions for her and she knew that
[36:35] she passed and then zaddy um talking
[36:37] about how you know all her test was
[36:39] examed I was like Lord can you just like
[36:41] can you please give me a call and say
[36:42] that you know they made a mistake all
[36:44] those years I passed the test instead
[36:46] just something um but and then um one
[36:48] time when I was talking to brother
[36:49] stepen sister Sharon um he really
[36:51] motivated me and then I remember um
[36:53] prior to that the next Sunday he
[36:54] preached about non and and and the
[36:56] little girl girl and it was the little
[36:57] girl Faith you know that healed n in so
[36:59] for me I was like brother Stephen was
[37:01] like the little girl and my dad because
[37:02] they kept kind of pushing me to you know
[37:04] you got to take the test you know and
[37:05] then he kind of gave me like a um a
[37:07] study guide way to kind of do it so I
[37:09] was just you know I was okay I have two
[37:10] months so 2023 I already told myself you
[37:13] know one of my things I went to I wanted
[37:14] to take this test and then the year kind
[37:16] of went by and then I only had like
[37:18] three months um before the year is over
[37:21] so then um I just I just kind of calcul
[37:22] I was okay two months I'm going to take
[37:24] this test um and I'm just going to start
[37:26] taking like I'm practicing at least 20
[37:28] to 50 questions every day so that's what
[37:29] I was doing and then one time I was
[37:31] actually at on my cousin's house and I
[37:33] met this girl she was just talking and
[37:35] she actually was an aesthetician too so
[37:37] she ended up kind of um helping me to
[37:38] kind of get a study guy a study Guy
[37:40] where I can um um practice the test too
[37:42] so I just kept every day 20 Questions 50
[37:45] questions a day um and then I officially
[37:47] took my test Thursday I took my test
[37:49] Thursday and I brought my sister I think
[37:51] I thought that um you know cuz the third
[37:52] time I'm going to take it I'm I'm going
[37:53] to give my results the same day um so
[37:56] you know it's just just I can get um so
[37:57] I can read my uh uh my results so I went
[38:00] down I went down that day I took the
[38:02] test and then usually like I said the
[38:04] test was um 110 questions and only had
[38:07] an hour and 30 minutes so I actually
[38:08] finished the test um under in under 30
[38:11] minutes and I had a whole hour just to
[38:13] kind of go back and review and I was
[38:15] shocked to myself because I I know
[38:16] myself I take every single minute um and
[38:19] and I just knew at that moment that I
[38:20] passed it so I was just glorifying God I
[38:22] was like thank you Lord thank you Lord
[38:23] for helping me pass cuz I knew I passed
[38:24] this test i l just stay I literally just
[38:26] said my seat just to be humble so I
[38:28] won't make everybody else nervous cuz I
[38:29] was finished like this but then I
[38:32] realized everything that I studied was
[38:34] exactly on the test the words the
[38:36] wording everything so um so I was just I
[38:39] just knew God was with
[38:41] me so I took the test and then um um
[38:44] Friday came um actually didn't get the
[38:46] results the same day the the email did
[38:48] to me so the email did to me I didn't
[38:49] want to look at it I was like I know I
[38:51] passed I know I passed so I gave it to
[38:52] my sister so she can um so she can email
[38:54] it to herself so we can like make a
[38:56] video of us like reacting to the um the
[38:57] score so yeah so the next day come I
[39:00] think last Sunday um we went out and
[39:02] then we um we all like I was just
[39:04] waiting and then she read my score to me
[39:05] and it said that I passed 82% out of a
[39:09] 100 that mean that meant that I only
[39:11] made out of0 questions I only missed 18

[1:22:32] background David was running
[1:22:35] away because Saul wanted to kill him
[1:22:40] amen so David decided to leave the
[1:22:44] Kingdom of Israel because the kingdom of
[1:22:47] Saul have rejected him and remember

[1:23:04] reason his GPS

[1:23:48] need to go through knob what was the
[1:23:51] knob the sanctuary the Tabernacle the
[1:23:55] priest were there what is pushing David
[1:23:59] toward that
[1:24:02] direction we
[1:24:04] clear verse one and said to him why are
[1:24:08] you here alone why are you alone and no
[1:24:12] man with you it doesn't mean that David
[1:24:14] was
[1:24:15] alone right but David did not have the
[1:24:19] company of
[1:24:20] Saul they usually see him with the

[1:38:48] will find a way to find bread and to
[1:38:52] pull the bread from the Tabernacle and
[1:38:54] give it to David what is that
[1:38:58] thing are we together yes let's go back
[1:39:01] to the where we are verse four and the

[1:39:43] taking a
[1:39:44] risk to give David something that is not
[1:39:49] lawful where did he get that
[1:39:53] Authority verse five and David answered
[1:39:56] the priest and said to him of a truth

[1:41:11] bread we can also eat it but the Lord
[1:41:13] say you cannot eat it if you're not a
[1:41:18] priest so what brought David there
[1:41:21] open the door not only for David but for
[1:41:25] also those that were following
[1:41:29] David amen he says yeah though he were
[1:41:34] how Sanctified do you see that word this

[1:41:48] went and took the bread but God say
[1:41:50] where do you eat eat that
[1:41:51] bread who gave the priest the permission
[1:41:54] to take that bread out of the Holy place

[1:42:21] finished but the showbread and the
[1:42:23] showbread had the Restriction what I'm

[1:43:18] first time in his life
[1:43:21] to taste of the showbread that no one
[1:43:25] else can taste only the
[1:43:28] priest amen there are seven days here
[1:43:31] which you can see the seven churches
[1:43:34] there are three days only that he kept
[1:43:36] himself which is Luther Westley and
[1:43:38] Pentecost justification sanctification
[1:43:40] baptism of the Holy Ghost that's when he
[1:43:42] reached I'm not going to get into that
[1:43:44] you already seen that amen amen and then
[1:43:46] the Bible say and then the sh bread that
[1:43:49] was taken from before the Lord to put
[1:43:51] what hot bread in the day when he was
[1:43:54] what away when he was taken away so this
[1:43:57] bread was hidden for seven
[1:44:00] days yes and was available on the
[1:44:03] seventh day and David came and and and
[1:44:06] and recuperate
[1:44:08] that on the first day nobody ate it the
[1:44:11] second day nobody ate it the third no
[1:44:14] one only the seven day and David come
[1:44:16] and pick it up amen amen what give David
[1:44:21] the authority to eat a bread that do not
[1:44:25] belong to a common
[1:44:28] person the Bible says this in the book
[1:44:31] of Hebrew verse 7 that for he of whom
[1:44:35] these things are spoken pretend to what
[1:44:37] to another tribe another tribe of which
[1:44:41] no man gave what attendance at the altar
[1:44:44] do you know that person right it's
[1:44:46] called melkisedek for it is evident that
[1:44:49] our Lord sprang out of what Judah of
[1:44:52] which tribe Moses spake what nothing
[1:44:55] concerning priesthood and it is yet far
[1:44:57] more evident that after the similitude
[1:45:00] of who there arise another what so the
[1:45:05] tribe of Judah had a priesthood that was
[1:45:08] hidden amen it was a secret priesthood
[1:45:12] that no one knew about it everybody okay
[1:45:16] that priesthood was not in effect
[1:45:19] yet because the levitical priesthood was
[1:45:22] in in effect amen but when David reached
[1:45:25] that point and he was in need amen amen
[1:45:30] and the bread the common bread was not
[1:45:33] available that priesthood open the
[1:45:36] dooren and gave David the permission to
[1:45:41] eat something that he's not lawful to
[1:45:44] eat because David was from the tribe of
[1:45:47] Judah and David was a type of Christ
[1:45:49] amen
[1:45:51] are we together are we
[1:45:53] together job to verse uh 8 you're almost
[1:45:57] there my friend verse 8 and David said
[1:46:01] to aimc is there not here under your
[1:46:05] hand what spear or sword amen for I have
[1:46:09] neither brought my what sword nor my
[1:46:12] what weapons with me because the king's
[1:46:15] business require what haste and the
[1:46:17] priest said the sword of who the
[1:46:20] the who the Philistines whom you do what
[1:46:23] SL in the valley of a behold it is here
[1:46:27] wrapping the what a CL behind the what
[1:46:30] the E the EOD was
[1:46:34] the so they took the sword and they put

[1:46:46] killed Goliath yes sir amen David took
[1:46:50] the sword from golad you know the story
[1:46:52] and cut the head of golad when the
[1:46:55] battle was over they took that sword and
[1:46:58] they wrap it in other word they put a
[1:47:02] sheath on a sword and they took it and
[1:47:05] they went not in front of the eord they
[1:47:09] put it behind on the back
[1:47:12] side on the back side of the eord on the
[1:47:16] back side of the
[1:47:17] r that's where they put the soul
[1:47:21] are you following me because the
[1:47:23] backside of the Bible have a
[1:47:27] seal are we together are we okay have I
[1:47:31] lost anybody so we found out that
[1:47:34] whatever brought David to this place
[1:47:37] open the door not only to the showbread
[1:47:40] but to a
[1:47:42] sword a sword that is behind the
[1:47:46] EUR a sword that is on the back side
[1:47:50] amen amen what trigger David to go to
[1:47:54] that place who push him there are we
[1:47:58] together verse n he said the sword of
[1:48:01] Goliath amen who you slew in the valley
[1:48:04] of hila behold it is here wrapping a clo
[1:48:07] behind the what if you would take that
[1:48:10] do what take it for there is no other
[1:48:13] save that here the only weapon in the
[1:48:15] Tabernacle is a sword amen remember that
[1:48:19] sword came from Goliath yes you cannot
[1:48:22] take a new sword to kill
[1:48:25] Goliath you cannot take a new Bible to
[1:48:29] destroy denomination amen you have to
[1:48:32] take what Luther and the other did and
[1:48:34] you pull the Bible and you slay them
[1:48:37] am amen you cannot fight without this
[1:48:41] Bible but this Bible came before the
[1:48:43] message
[1:48:46] came but the problem is something was
[1:48:49] sealed the Bible was
[1:48:51] sealed amen praise God he said for there
[1:48:55] is no other save that here and David
[1:48:58] said there is what none like that do
[1:49:00] what give it David is saying that he
[1:49:03] never seen a sword that look like that
[1:49:07] one it's a different sword Al together
[1:49:10] amen so David changed sword from his own
[1:49:13] sword to the sword that he did kill
[1:49:16] Goliath before the sword that gave him
[1:49:19] the greatest victory of Israel he's
[1:49:21] using the back sword that same Ministry
[1:49:24] that help him kill Goliath he's using
[1:49:27] back that same Ministry now to begin to
[1:49:29] do something else amen amen amen what
[1:49:33] are we drawing from
[1:49:35] here there is something that happened to
[1:49:37] David that changed his Direction he
[1:49:40] pushed him toward the temple when David
[1:49:43] went into the Tabernacle he found out
[1:49:46] that there were no common bread amen
[1:49:49] amen but then David never stopped there
[1:49:51] right whatever pushed him there open him
[1:49:55] the door to go beyond the law and to eat
[1:49:59] the showbread and nothing happened to
[1:50:01] him and he take the showbread and give
[1:50:04] also to the people that came with him
[1:50:05] and nothing happened to them then David
[1:50:08] move again furthermore he said do you
[1:50:11] have any weapon here and they brought
[1:50:12] him a sword so he got the bread and the
[1:50:15] SW together and left the
[1:50:17] Tabernacle what pushed David there
[1:50:20] Matthew
[1:50:22] 12 we already pray my
[1:50:26] friend if you dare you can say
[1:50:31] Amen Matthew 12 verse one if you
[1:50:35] thereare you can say Amen which day did
[1:50:38] David attend the
[1:50:41] Tabernacle which was called the
[1:50:44] Sabbath amen and there was no
[1:50:47] restriction for
[1:50:49] David Matthew 12 verse1 at that time
[1:50:53] Jesus went on the water Sabbath
[1:50:58] day which day David went into the
[1:51:00] Tabernacle Sabbath day which day Jesus
[1:51:03] is going to the field the Sabbath day
[1:51:06] why he went on the Sabbath day through
[1:51:09] the what corn and his disciple not
[1:51:14] Jesus his disciple were how in hunger
[1:51:18] who gave them the power to to enter the
[1:51:20] corn
[1:51:23] Jesus who gave them the power to enter
[1:51:26] the H yes L who was hungry Jesus who was
[1:51:31] hungry the disciple the disciple being
[1:51:34] hungry under the Lord they break into
[1:51:36] somebody else
[1:51:38] cornfield but it happened on the Sabbath
[1:51:41] day we clear he says and the disciple
[1:51:45] were hungry and begin to plug the ears
[1:51:48] of corn you remember the scripture now
[1:51:50] and to eat but when the Pharisees saw it
[1:51:54] they said to him behold your disciple do
[1:51:58] that which is not what lawful to do upon
[1:52:01] the what Sabbath day they did the
[1:52:03] Pharisee didn't have a problem with them
[1:52:07] eating because they knew the lord gave
[1:52:10] them permission to eat but the problem
[1:52:13] that the Pharisee had is they are eating
[1:52:15] on the seventh day on the Sabbath day
[1:52:18] there should be a home
[1:52:23] but this
[1:52:25] hunger is breaking the
[1:52:29] Sabbath this hunger not only is breaking
[1:52:32] somebody else property but it's also
[1:52:35] breaking the law of
[1:52:37] Sabbath are we together let's blend this
[1:52:40] with
[1:52:41] David verse three but he said to them
[1:52:46] have you not read what who David when
[1:52:49] when he was what in
[1:52:54] hungry David did that when he was what
[1:52:59] hry David did that again when he was
[1:53:02] what hungry so what pushed David to the
[1:53:07] Tabernacle what are we together now are
[1:53:10] we together now now you begin together
[1:53:12] it what pushed David to the Tabernacle
[1:53:18] hunger the hunger of David amen gave him
[1:53:25] access to the
[1:53:28] showbread amen and gave him access to a
[1:53:37] sword that hunger when he took David to
[1:53:41] the Tabernacle that hunger was looking
[1:53:44] for food and the priest said there is no
[1:53:46] food that hunger said mm me when I'm
[1:53:49] tricked
[1:53:50] I don't go back without food what kind
[1:53:52] of food do you have here no we have the
[1:53:55] sh I mean showbread you are not supposed
[1:53:58] to eat it that that hunger say me I can
[1:54:01] eat it he won't do
[1:54:04] anything we clear now he said David when
[1:54:08] he was hungry and they that were with
[1:54:10] him how he enter into the house of God
[1:54:14] and did eat what the showbread which was
[1:54:17] not lawful for who this is Jesus saying
[1:54:20] Jesus is saying that he was not lawful
[1:54:24] this is not a PRI this is God himself
[1:54:26] God Jesus is saying that he was not
[1:54:29] correct for David to eat the
[1:54:33] showbread Heaven and Earth will pass
[1:54:35] away but his word will not but God is
[1:54:37] saying that David was not supposed to
[1:54:40] eat the showbread but his
[1:54:42] hunger gave him the showbread and me God
[1:54:46] I kept my mouth
[1:54:48] quiet instead of killing
[1:54:51] David I could not do anything
[1:54:56] whyl Jesus say he ate the sh bread which
[1:55:00] was not lawful for him to do what eat
[1:55:03] neither for them which were what in
[1:55:06] other way David
[1:55:08] extrapolate he went over instead of
[1:55:11] stopping at himself he even take the
[1:55:13] showbread and give it to normal people
[1:55:16] and Jesus said he was not right but
[1:55:19] David did it and now Jesus is using that
[1:55:24] scripture that experience to combat the
[1:55:28] Pharisee
[1:55:30] amen what seems to be like it's against
[1:55:33] the law
[1:55:36] amen hunger open the door to it
[1:55:40] amen am am amen father help us amen amen
[1:55:45] he says with him but only for The Who
[1:55:49] PRI so Jesus is saying here that there
[1:55:52] is no one who's lawful to eat of the
[1:55:55] showbread except the priest but David
[1:55:59] did it why because he was hungry Jesus
[1:56:03] is replying to the Pharisee that you try
[1:56:05] to condemn me because I'm eating my
[1:56:08] disciple are eating on the Sabbath day
[1:56:11] okay I want you to remember do you
[1:56:13] remember David in the Old Testament he
[1:56:15] was just on the Sabbath day he was just
[1:56:18] so hungry as much as my disciple are
[1:56:21] hungry but he did
[1:56:24] worst because he went and took bread
[1:56:28] that he is not lawful to eat and he even
[1:56:31] give it to the people that were not
[1:56:33] lawful to eat so hunger open
[1:56:38] doors where there is no door
[1:56:45] amen are we together have I lost anyone
[1:56:50] hunger can get you into the
[1:56:53] field amen when it's not
[1:56:57] lawful amen amen hanger hunger gave
[1:57:03] permission to the disciple to break the
[1:57:09] Sabbath amen and we find out that hunger
[1:57:13] open the door for
[1:57:15] David Amen to behave
[1:57:20] like a
[1:57:23] priest why he ate the
[1:57:26] showbread amen and then also he took the
[1:57:29] sword from the Tabernacle and nothing
[1:57:32] happened to
[1:57:33] him amen amen amen now follow me

[2:09:14] came if what happily perhaps he might
[2:09:17] found what anything there on and when he
[2:09:20] came to it he found what nothing but Le
[2:09:23] when David entered to the Tabernacle did
[2:09:25] he find common bread did he back up what
[2:09:29] happened to
[2:09:30] David he got his bread that was reserved
[2:09:34] for the pries when Jesus got to the tree
[2:09:38] he was looking for food there was no
[2:09:40] food his hunger didn't back

[2:10:25] market hunger doesn't look at the
[2:10:28] economy hunger look for the
[2:10:31] [Applause]
[2:10:36] desire because normally Jesus should
[2:10:39] have stopped and say wait a minute this
[2:10:40] is not the season this is not the right
[2:10:43] place but his hanger his hunger was
[2:10:45] looking like where is the a tree there

[2:11:10] level of
[2:11:12] anointing verse 14 Jesus answered and
[2:11:15] say unto it what no man eat fruit of be

[2:11:21] what heard it and what happened the next
[2:11:22] day wither down the tree was what wither

[2:11:32] of the spoken
[2:11:34] word where you speak to this mountain
[2:11:37] and say be removed and Jesus Jesus
[2:11:40] opened the power by

[2:13:52] yet that's why Paul say for we walk by
[2:13:55] what fa or Not by what sight are we
[2:13:59] together when Israel was coming out of
[2:14:01] Egypt Paul is mentioning of two things
[2:14:05] Paul say and all did what eat the same
[2:14:09] spiritual meat and did what drink the
[2:14:12] same spiritual drink if you notice at
[2:14:15] the meat and the drink are both
[2:14:19] spiritual that's right spiritual doesn't
[2:14:23] mean
[2:14:26] imaginary because Israel ate
[2:14:29] man amen Israel didn't just have what
[2:14:33] the imaginary water Israel drunk water
[2:14:36] amen so when Israel was hungry he
[2:14:41] brought forth a
[2:14:43] food from a supernatural Angelic food
[2:14:47] amen are we together yes sir are you
[2:14:49] following me when Israel was thirsty
[2:14:53] Israel got water yes sir but water from

[2:15:01] did all drink water the same spiritual
[2:15:04] drink and the drunk of that water
[2:15:06] spiritual Rock So The Rock was natural
[2:15:09] or spiritual spiritual Rock that Rock
[2:15:11] that did what follow them have you ever

[2:15:26] so Paul is saying that the water that
[2:15:30] was given to Israel that fill 2 million
[2:15:33] people and the Beast was coming from an
[2:15:38] individual am are you following me so if
[2:15:42] you look at that individual he look like
[2:15:45] a human being amen when you go 300
[2:15:48] around him you don't see water but if
[2:15:52] you hit that individual are you
[2:15:54] following me you will see that

[2:17:41] created in the wilderness this is where
[2:17:43] Mana was created in the wilderness this
[2:17:46] is where Jesus multiplied by the bread
[2:17:48] in the wilderness this is where Jesus
[2:17:50] beat the devil in the wilderness this is
[2:17:53] the place that Jesus also had the power
[2:17:57] to create or to change uh Stone unto
[2:18:00] bread everything happened in the
[2:18:02] wilderness and God is telling Israel
[2:18:05] remember the Wilderness what happened in

[2:18:09] remember all the way which the Lord that
[2:18:11] God LED thee this 40 years where in the

[2:18:21] commandment or no listen to this and he
[2:18:24] humbled thee amen and did what suffered
[2:18:27] thee to hunger who brought the hunger
[2:18:30] God if God brought the hunger who's
[2:18:33] going to satisfy the
[2:18:35] hunger in other word who brought the
[2:18:38] desire who's going to satisfy the desire
[2:18:41] who pushed David to the Tabernacle God

[2:18:47] who took Jesus to the tree God
[2:18:51] hallelujah are we together Hallelujah
[2:18:53] are we moving together he says and he
[2:18:56] suffered the to do what hunger and fed
[2:18:59] thee with what Manner which thou what
[2:19:02] knewest not nether did your father
[2:19:06] no the food manner was already in the
[2:19:11] plan of God are you there and God had
[2:19:15] that plan for Israel in the wilderness
[2:19:19] do you follow me do you follow me but in
[2:19:22] order to draw that plan out you need
[2:19:26] hunger am amen God have to push you to a
[2:19:30] circumstance that will create hunger
[2:19:34] because there is something that you need
[2:19:36] to

[2:19:42] God could have taken Israel three time
[2:19:45] three three days and put them in the
[2:19:47] promis land brother Bram even said that
[2:19:50] but God had a plan God say this
[2:19:53] generation here I'm going to let them
[2:19:56] taste
[2:19:58] Mana but the only way I'm going to let
[2:20:01] them taste Mana they must desire
[2:20:05] it because I already plan I already
[2:20:09] predestinated Mana for them and that
[2:20:12] manner they father didn't know that
[2:20:16] that's right because the father was in
[2:20:18] Egypt and their mother didn't know that
[2:20:21] and they themselves did not know it what
[2:20:24] are you trying to say
[2:20:27] Pastor never limit yourself to the level

[2:20:58] I'm
[2:21:00] saying sometime most of the time we grow
[2:21:04] up in
[2:21:05] circumstances and those circumstances
[2:21:08] put us in bondage in other word those
[2:21:11] circumstances create
[2:21:14] complex you begin to desire certain life
[2:21:18] based on what you live with your
[2:21:20] parent if your parent were poor you want
[2:21:25] to also live in that poverty you find it
[2:21:28] that it's
[2:21:33] normal I don't know if you get me if
[2:21:36] your parent always wear in depth for you
[2:21:40] to live in depth is normal but God
[2:21:43] doesn't work like
[2:21:46] that no God has a program for your life
[2:21:51] that your parent have nothing to do with
[2:21:53] it that you yourself don't even have to
[2:21:57] imagine that you never thought the one
[2:22:00] who thought that is God I don't know if
[2:22:03] you're following me that's what he's
[2:22:05] telling Israel that when I gave you food

[2:53:43] enter a field and to satisfy itself
[2:53:46] whichever hunger comes have a power of
[2:53:50] its own
[2:53:52] satisfaction hunger opened the disciple
[2:53:55] to get into a field on the Sabbath day
[2:53:57] hunger took David and even opened the
[2:54:00] door for David to get the showbread and
[2:54:03] to even get back to the sword of Goliath
[2:54:06] hunger took Jesus Into the Wilderness to
[2:54:09] beat the devil the greatest beating ever
[2:54:13] and Jesus beat him him with the lowest
[2:54:16] at the lowest state right and brother
[2:54:18] brandham said to show that any Christian
[2:54:21] whichever Lev you are your normal
[2:54:24] natural hunger can beat the devil any
[2:54:27] time anywhere under any
[2:54:31] circumstances hunger took Jesus to the
[2:54:34] tree and expressed the third
[2:54:38] pool hunger was given to Israel to bring
[2:54:42] God's plan that Israel did not know and
[2:54:46] their father did not know blessed are
[2:54:49] you when you hunger when you thirst it
[2:54:52] is a good thing brother brandom say just
[2:54:54] to thirst you are
[2:54:57] blessed because it's telling you you're

[2:55:06] coupl with a guarantee whenever hunger
[2:55:08] comes you're going to get what you're
[2:55:10] hungering for whenever a thirst come
[2:55:12] you're going to get what you're
[2:55:13] thirsting for
[2:55:15] let's stop right here and we'll pick up
[2:55:18] let's
[2:55:27] stand the secret of hunger and thirsting
[2:55:32] I thought I'm going to finish this but
[2:55:34] I'm going to show you by the grace of
[2:55:36] God where he goes and you begin to
[2:55:39] discern your life
[2:55:43] differently
[2:55:45] amen the bosses keep dropping
[2:55:49] thing do you know when
[2:55:53] David went to the battle yes he was not
[2:55:57] even going to the
[2:55:59] battle he was going to get food that's
[2:56:03] right true amen that's right his father
[2:56:07] gave him food to take food to his
[2:56:10] brother he didn't intend to
[2:56:13] fight but when his brother saw him amen
[2:56:18] David when he got to the
[2:56:20] battlefield he begin to hear
[2:56:24] Goliath amen Goliath was speaking for 40
[2:56:28] days everybody shut
[2:56:31] up but when David heard Goliath speaking
[2:56:35] amen he turned around and begin to ask a
[2:56:39] question he said what are we going to do
[2:56:42] to the man who's going to kill kill them
[2:56:44] man that's right right do you follow me
[2:56:48] what I'm trying to show you is something
[2:56:50] yes his own Brother Blood
[2:56:55] Brother this is what I'm trying to show
[2:56:57] you came and told him that we know your
[2:57:01] audacity you always try to show off you
[2:57:05] trying to always show that nobody knows
[2:57:07] anything it's only you who have the
[2:57:09] entire
[2:57:11] Revelation they were doing that to
[2:57:14] quench him quench him but the hunger of
[2:57:17] David was calling for something
[2:57:20] different what I'm telling you is be
[2:57:23] careful what you're
[2:57:25] hearing be careful what somebody else is
[2:57:28] telling you because our covenant are
[2:57:31] different am don't let anybody
[2:57:35] discourage you for something that you
[2:57:37] feel in your heart like it's
[2:57:41] poting I don't know if you get what I'm
[2:57:43] saying because the one that will try to
[2:57:45] push you down is your own brother it's
[2:57:48] your own message
[2:57:50] believer that's true that's true because
[2:57:53] they don't understand why you always
[2:57:56] come up with plan amen everybody will be
[2:57:59] quiet you the only one that will come up
[2:58:01] like no uh this window is bad
[2:58:05] everybody's quiet with the you always
[2:58:07] the one coming up with it it's not you
[2:58:08] you were built like
[2:58:11] that and if you let yourself in itting
[2:58:15] you're not going to break that Goliath
[2:58:17] but when Goliath head was chopped down
[2:58:19] even his own brother forgot what they
[2:58:21] told him they also jump in the battle
[2:58:23] and they begin to enjoy the killing so
[2:58:26] don't stop because your battle Cann now
[2:58:31] up brother Bram say David when he
[2:58:34] chopped golad he held his hand as a
[2:58:38] testimony to tell Israel that you see
[2:58:41] what you can do yes
[2:58:44] amen there are many complexes in the
[2:58:47] families and those complexes will try to
[2:58:50] shut you down yes but God might be might
[2:58:53] have chosen you to break that thing if
[2:58:56] you back up you blocking the family but
[2:58:59] if you broke that he will give courage
