[14:56] friend you there we're going to take off
[14:58] soon
[14:59] amen remember the former things you
[15:02] remember the scripture
[15:03] now of old for I am
[15:08] God amen amen and there is none like
[15:12] none else I am God and there is none
[15:16] like me clear you understand the
[15:18] scripture
[15:19] now how is that God verse 10 declaring
[15:24] the end from the
[15:27] beginning and from ancient times the
[15:30] things that are not yet done saying my
[15:34] counsel shall do what stand and I will
[15:37] do all my what pleasure so God knows
[15:40] your end before you even start in other
[15:44] word there is nothing that is happening
[15:46] in your life that is out care God
[15:49] already have your movie but whatever he
[15:52] purpose whatever God plan that will
[15:56] happen that will stand you might be
[15:58] seated vers 11
[16:01] calling a reverence bird from the East
[16:05] the man that execute my counsel from a
[16:08] far country yeah I have spoken
[16:11] it I also will do what bring it to pass
[16:15] I have purposed it I will also do it
[16:19] when God purpose something regardless of
[16:22] what happened it will happen amen amen
[16:25] let's go to the book of Hebrew chap 2:9
[16:30] glory to
[16:31] God those on YouTube okay now Brother
[16:34] David praise
[16:38] God
[16:40] Amen
[16:42] Hebrew chapter
[16:46] 2 verse 9 very familiar scripture the
[16:49] counsel of God the plan of God the
[16:54] purpose of
[16:55] God will
[16:57] stand
[16:59] amen amen no
[17:01] matter what happened God's purpose will
[17:05] stand
[17:06] amen Hebrews chap 2:9 if you dare you
[17:10] can say amen amen very familiar
[17:13] scripture again the Bible say but we see
[17:17] Jesus who was made how a little lower
[17:20] than the Angels so Jesus was not lower
[17:22] than the
[17:24] angel he was higher than
[17:27] anything higher than the highest he was
[17:30] the top but for some reason God took him
[17:35] and made him lower even lower than his
[17:38] own
[17:39] servant the angel what's the purpose of
[17:42] it why can I leave from a higher level
[17:46] going down
[17:48] condescending why brother uh the Bible
[17:51] says that he was made lower than the
[17:54] angel for the suffering of
[17:57] death because you cannot kill God that's
[18:01] right so God have to be
[18:05] condescended so that you can kill God
[18:08] they killed the man Jesus Christ that's
[18:10] right but they could not kill God still
[18:13] but God was so identify with the body of
[18:16] Jesus Christ until when you kill Jesus
[18:18] you killing God it is counted as you
[18:21] killing God everybody okay I hope I'm
[18:25] not losing
[18:27] you glory and honor that he by the grace
[18:31] of God should taste death for who every
[18:34] man for he became him for whom are all
[18:38] things and by whom are all things in
[18:42] bringing many sons to glory to make the
[18:46] captain of their salvation perfect
[18:50] through what
[18:52] suffering so
[18:54] suffering bring
[18:57] perfection you remember last Sunday
[19:00] right Paul say our glory in Tribulation
[19:03] so it's a
[19:04] Perfection because Joseph means
[19:07] Perfection amen will you remember that
[19:10] Perfection through
[19:13] suffering and Christ himself was our
[19:17] example sufferings plural amen verse 11
[19:21] for both he that
[19:23] sanctifies and they who are Sanctified
[19:26] are all of what water so so we are no
[19:29] different than God Amen am that's why we
[19:33] are
[19:34] Gods we and God are one amen so if Jesus
[19:37] went through this treatment what do you
[19:40] expect you're going to get a portion of
[19:42] that treatment unless you in a different
[19:45] species come on now brother than the
[19:47] Lord Jesus Christ but if you look like
[19:50] the groom expect to go through the
[19:52] groom's
[19:54] treatment because that material have a
[19:57] certain treatment amen amen and the
[20:00] Bible say they are all one for which
[20:02] cause he is not ashamed to call them
[20:05] what so Jesus is our
[20:08] brother amen amen amen glory to God
[20:12] let's go to First Peter chapter 4 then
[20:15] we
[20:16] pray this message help us understand who
[20:19] we
[20:21] are the Lord and that God is not
[20:23] somebody far away and we are little
[20:25] little little little subject no we came
[20:27] out of God we came from God and we are
[20:31] going back to God whatever happened to
[20:34] Christ belong to us that's why brother
[20:36] BR I'm say whatever speak of the groom
[20:39] speak also of the Bride amen let's go to
[20:43] First Peter chapter 4 verse2 if you dare
[20:46] you can say Amen then we can
[20:49] pray the Bible
[20:53] says beloved you know who's beloved we
[20:57] went through this before beloved I want
[20:59] you to prosper in all you remember all
[21:01] of that beloved we are in the Beloved in
[21:04] Christ beloved think it not
[21:08] strange concerning the veryy trial which
[21:12] is to try you in other word when a trial
[21:16] comes God don't want you to take it
[21:20] like I was not expecting
[21:23] this I didn't know this going to happen
[21:26] God said do not take it strange amen
[21:29] right just expect
[21:31] it because it's going to perfect you so
[21:35] do not think it strange it's not strange
[21:38] don't think it's
[21:40] strange amen amen it's not strange it is
[21:44] common amen there is a purpose for it he
[21:47] said beloved think it not strange
[21:50] concerning the fiery
[21:53] trial not just a trial it's a fiery one
[21:57] it's really painful
[22:01] amen a fiery
[22:03] one amen a fiery a painful
[22:08] trial a painful test when he comes do
[22:13] not think it
[22:14] strange don't be crying like this is the
[22:17] end of the world no sir
[22:20] amen amen
[22:23] amen which is to try you as though some
[22:27] strange thing has happened to you that's
[22:30] it
[22:31] amen God is telling you if something
[22:34] really painful comes don't look at that
[22:37] thing like what is
[22:39] this no it is common in other word first
[22:43] belittle it amen amen that's it amen am
[22:47] amen am amen amen do you know those who
[22:50] play soccer when they send the ball into
[22:53] you the first thing you do you need to
[22:55] take the ball and stabilize it so when
[22:57] the trial is coming you put it down
[22:59] first you say slow down you're coming
[23:02] too much with energy come on down slow
[23:04] down what are you looking for what are
[23:06] you here for what is your purpose in my
[23:09] life why did God open the door so that

[23:38] cry God say when a fiery trial comes

[23:52] Rejoice Rejoice how can I rejoice when
[23:56] it's
[23:57] painful
[23:58] it

[24:11] identification there it
[24:13] is that you are actually part of Christ
[24:18] God when a
[24:19] painful trial is coming it is actually a
[24:25] an ID an identification so when it comes

[25:18] identification
[25:21] am that you are with
[25:23] Christ that you are actually sharing
[25:26] amen the pants of Christ

[1:26:53] only took the C
[1:26:55] dip it in the blood and send it and say
[1:26:59] you
[1:27:00] deserve but their original thought
[1:27:04] follow me carefully was that when they
[1:27:07] see the evidence they will say what a
[1:27:10] wild beast has what when they send the
[1:27:15] court they didn't give that
[1:27:18] message they let the one who's receiving
[1:27:23] the CT to
[1:27:25] decode to
[1:27:27] discern and the one who was receiving
[1:27:30] the Cod was a
[1:27:32] prophet but God turn also that engine
[1:27:39] off come on Lord are we together are we
[1:27:43] together they never say this is the quot
[1:27:46] of Joseph go give it to Daddy and say
[1:27:49] hey a wild beast has devouring no they
[1:27:52] just take your message what is evidence
[1:27:54] for sistera take this send it but when
[1:27:59] they sending there is an intent but they
[1:28:02] don't associate the intent with it the
[1:28:04] intent will be developed by the one
[1:28:07] receiving
[1:28:09] it I'm reading to you the Bible my
[1:28:12] friend they say look and you yourself do
[1:28:16] the discern in other way do the ma and
[1:28:18] find out what the message is there but
[1:28:21] they knew the message they want to
[1:28:22] convey is a wild the Beast has what and
[1:28:25] that's the message that was
[1:28:29] decoded you might not say a message
[1:28:31] right
[1:28:32] out but your vibration the brde will
[1:28:36] catch
[1:28:38] it you can send just a message blank but
[1:28:42] we know what you're trying to say listen
[1:28:44] to this my friend verse 33 and he knew
[1:28:47] it and say it is my what son's cold
[1:28:51] that's correct and and what an evil
[1:28:55] Beast has what deved was that true how
[1:28:58] can a prophet decod a lie come on

[1:29:05] deod him if you ask them hey why did you
[1:29:08] send this no we just send they we told
[1:29:10] him to
[1:29:12] discern but the one discern him say a
[1:29:15] wild be how did he match their
[1:29:20] intent how William Marion Bram am help
[1:29:25] us up a little bit he says but God in
[1:29:28] his prophet and in his SE and so forth
[1:29:32] absolutely knows that these things as
[1:29:35] God will what reveal it there is many
[1:29:37] thing he don't reveal to his
[1:29:41] servant
[1:29:43] amen amen look at old Jacob sitting on a
[1:29:48] stone sitting up there and brought his
[1:29:51] boy's coat back and you know he was a
[1:29:53] prophet brought his court back and say a
[1:29:56] beast kill your boy that was wrong he
[1:29:58] didn't know the difference for 40 years
[1:30:02] wow God turned the nuclear engine of
[1:30:06] Joseph off and he turned the nuclear
[1:30:08] engine off of a prophet off both of them
[1:30:12] are believing
[1:30:14] lies and Jacob is
[1:30:17] grieving Upon A Lie which is not a
[1:30:20] truth based on what the BR orchestrate

[1:52:11] disappointment are what are God's Divine
[1:52:14] will happening for

[1:52:52] to see what we shall do
[1:52:55] am Joseph
[1:52:57] in Joseph
[1:52:59] in this morning I say this friend after
[1:53:03] 31 years of ministry after 31 years of
[1:53:07] TOS on the field of the field I want to
[1:53:10] make my testimony to this to what I have
[1:53:15] seen what disappointments I have seen
[1:53:17] what the time I've asked for things and
[1:53:20] cry for what for things and beg for what
[1:53:23] and Fa to get them but if you just wait
[1:53:26] how patiently upon who God then I know
[1:53:30] that it will work just exactly right it
[1:53:33] will come out just exactly right that's
[1:53:36] just exactly the what the right thing am
[1:53:41] God is pushing you toward his
[1:53:43] destination because he's the one that
[1:53:45] holds your destiny amen disappointment
[1:53:48] will come not from far off from your own
[1:53:52] brother
[1:53:58] hallelujah hallelujah that's why the
[1:54:01] Bible say there is no temptation taking
[1:54:03] you but such is what as common to man in
[1:54:06] other word what is happening to you is
[1:54:08] not super
[1:54:10] human right God cannot give you
[1:54:12] something that is super super
[1:54:14] human it is common God know you can
[1:54:17] handle it amen but God is how faithful
[1:54:21] who will not suffer you to be tempted
[1:54:23] how above that you are
[1:54:27] able a great big army for one man
[1:54:32] because God knew that one man can handle
[1:54:34] the entire Army and lead them all the
[1:54:37] way and put them in the Trap one man so
[1:54:40] the trial that seems to be big big big
[1:54:42] big big big big big big if you see a big
[1:54:45] host a big Chariot a big great host just
[1:54:49] know that you got more power so God have
[1:54:52] match you with your with the level of
[1:54:55] your power if your power is 89 just
[1:55:00] expect the devil to be no more than
[1:55:03] 89 so somebody might get 30 by you
[1:55:06] getting 89 don't cry and say they got a
[1:55:09] small I got a big one it means you A big
[1:55:11] one that's why they have to increase
[1:55:15] it yes God could not give you something
[1:55:18] greater than what you can handle you are
[1:55:21] always you will be always greater than
[1:55:24] your
[1:55:29] trial don't look Elisha say look Elijah
[1:55:33] say Elisha say listen they that are with
[1:55:36] us are more than all that you see here
[1:55:40] you are seeing the number but what I
[1:55:42] have is more than them in other words
[1:55:44] the power of Elisha is more than the
[1:55:47] power of the enemy God will never give
[1:55:49] you a trial that is more than your
[1:55:51] strength
[1:55:52] the more painful the tri the stronger
[1:55:56] you
[1:55:57] are the more he hurt it's telling you
[1:56:00] that you reach a level that the devil
[1:56:03] have to hurt you so much for you to even
[1:56:06] feel because if the devil come with a
[1:56:08] small one you tackle them easily you can
[1:56:10] just do

[1:56:14] make you awake that you see where you
[1:56:16] are CL up a little bit more
[1:56:19] higher Jesus amen amen amen but will
