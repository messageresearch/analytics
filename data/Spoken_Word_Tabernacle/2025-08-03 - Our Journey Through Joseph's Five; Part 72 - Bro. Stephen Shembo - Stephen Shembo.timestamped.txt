[0:02] that doeth a son likewise. Father, a
[0:04] father workketh, and the son workketh
[0:07] hitherto. Is that right?
[0:09] &gt;&gt; He did not do a thing within himself
[0:12] until God showed him a vision of what
[0:15] was being done.
[0:17] &gt;&gt; That's his own word. St. John 5:19,
[0:20] "Verily, verily, I say unto you, the Son
[0:22] can do nothing in himself, but what he
[0:25] sees the Father doing, that doeth the
[0:27] Son likewise, and he'll show you greater
[0:30] things than this that you may marvel."
[0:31] In other words, that man healed with
[0:33] diabetic or prostrate trouble or
[0:35] whatever it was. Now, watch that one
[0:37] man. He had had a vision.
[0:40] Look at him. When when Lazarus died,
[0:42] when he told Lazarus going to die, he
[0:44] went away to the city. They sent for
[0:46] him, he went another day's journey. They
[0:48] sent you he went another day's journey
[0:50] and then one day he stopped when he know
[0:52] the vision is just about fulfilled and
[0:54] said well our friend Lazarus sleepeth
[0:57] and the disciples said he do well he
[0:59] said he's dead and for your sake I'm
[1:01] glad I wasn't there but I go wake him
[1:04] &gt;&gt; amen
[1:06] &gt;&gt; what God had showed him what was going
[1:08] to take place
[1:10] &gt;&gt; showed him what was going to take place
[1:15] when Martha come and met him on the road
[1:17] coming. She said, "Yeah, I had been your
[1:19] Lord. Th my brother would have died. But
[1:22] even now, whatever you ask God, God will
[1:24] do it."
[1:25] &gt;&gt; See, Jesus knew that he was going to
[1:29] wake Lazarus for God had already showed
[1:31] him.
[1:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34] &gt;&gt; And he didn't do nothing but what the
[1:35] father showed him to do. Is that right?
[1:38] &gt;&gt; That's his own word.
[1:39] &gt;&gt; Well, if he's the same yesterday, today,
[1:41] and forever, he's working the same in
[1:43] his church today as he was yesterday,
[1:45] today, and forever. Is that right?
[1:48] &gt;&gt; He does what the father shows.
[1:50] &gt;&gt; All the prophets of old, some of them
[1:52] said, "Look at Elijah lived be nearly in
[1:54] his 80s, I guess." And he only done four
[1:57] miracles or eight, something like that.
[2:00] And all of his time
[2:02] he only done, one man said to me not
[2:05] long ago said, "Brother Brand, if that
[2:07] power was back on the earth, he would be
[2:09] just going through the hospitals raising
[2:11] everybody." I said, "It never did do
[2:13] it." Amen.
[2:15] &gt;&gt; He said, "How about Elijah?" When he
[2:16] went up there and said, "Come up here
[2:17] and prove and I'll show you who's God."
[2:20] He said, "If we had that same God in the
[2:22] world today doing that said, God of
[2:24] Elijah would come down." I said, "Yes,
[2:26] if God Elijah told his prophets, so he
[2:28] would do the same thing."
[2:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:30] &gt;&gt; He said, "Elijah done that upon you." I
[2:32] said, "No, he never." When he made his
[2:34] sacrifice and laid his stuff and order
[2:36] and everything like that, he stepped out
[2:38] there and said, "Lord, I've done all of
[2:41] this at your command. Yeah.
[2:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:45] &gt;&gt; Your command,
[2:46] &gt;&gt; what you say do, Lord,
[2:49] &gt;&gt; that I'll do.
[2:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:52] &gt;&gt; Then Jesus in this church today would be
[2:55] just as powerless as your faith is and
[2:59] just as powerful as your faith is.
[3:02] &gt;&gt; He'd be limited to whatever God would
[3:04] tell him to do that he could do. If
[3:06] Jesus was here tonight, he might stand
[3:09] before you or you stand before him, he'd
[3:11] tell you your life. He might what was
[3:13] going on. He might know what you
[3:36] telling them of a little lady that had a
[3:40] new Methodist church.
[3:42] the brother there was raised in Kentucky
[3:44] together and I was Baptist preacher and
[3:47] he was a Methodist and so he said Billy
[3:50] if you just come down have one night at
[3:52] a little little church down there he had
[3:54] a place down there and they had the
[3:55] people stand on the street said won't I
[3:57] ask you pray for a person and when it
[3:59] was sort of cool said Billy could could
[4:02] I take that back said I got one of my
[4:04] Sunday school teachers is sitting here
[4:05] said she's the middle case and said I've
[4:09] had such an awful time with her
[4:12] but said she's a lovely person. Said
[4:14] she's a divine step just lay hands on
[4:15] her. I did prayed for her. Couple weeks
[4:18] after that I met her again. She was the
[4:20] same shape.
[4:22] One day the Holy Spirit came into the
[4:24] room. I said to my wife, "Is she here
[4:26] now?" She said, "Can I call that woman
[4:28] from New Albony?" I said, "Call her up."
[4:30] When she come and sat there a little
[4:32] while, I spoke to her a little bit. I
[4:34] began to notice a little black car
[4:36] running like that.
[4:38] I said, "I see a little car running."
[4:39] was you ever in a car accident? She
[4:41] said, "No." I said, "But she was with a
[4:43] lightheaded man in an almost strange
[4:45] truck and she began to scream and talk
[4:46] her voice. She'd been going to a
[4:48] psychiatrist for 10 years." And there
[4:52] the Holy Spirit told her of how that
[4:55] when her husband was overseas, she lived
[4:56] untrue to her marriage vow and all that
[4:58] she had done like that. She said, "Well,
[5:00] Brother Brown, I confess that to God." I
[5:02] said, "You never sinned against God. You
[5:04] sinned against your husband. You'll have
[5:06] to go make that right with him first."
[5:08] And she said, "Oh, I" I said, "That's
[5:10] back in the Gabriel of your soul." And
[5:12] all they I said, "They could pour a
[5:14] gallon of oil on you and kick and stomp
[5:16] and cast out devils as much as they
[5:18] wanted to. It'll never be able to find a
[5:21] cure to you. Find the cause.
[5:25] &gt;&gt; You got to find the cause first,
[5:28] &gt;&gt; then you get the cure. What's wrong?
[5:31] Where's it at?" And she said, "I can't
[5:34] tell him that."
[5:36] He said, I said, "Well, you must." I
[5:38] said, "Doesn't he work for a Chevrolet
[5:40] company?" "Yes." "And there's a lady who
[5:41] works there was wearing a pink dress the
[5:44] other day. He was in a green Chevrolet
[5:46] car. He done the same act that you did."
[5:49] I said, "Go get him on the phone." I go
[5:50] out there and see if that isn't right.
[5:52] She called her husband and they
[5:54] confessed to one another. Come back up.
[5:56] The evil spirit left the

[10:33] Lord, I worship
[10:39] you.
[10:40] [Music]

[11:49] Lord,
[11:53] [Music]
[11:56] for Your name is holy,
[12:03] holy,
[12:04] [Music]
[12:16] Lord. We thank you, Father.
[12:18] We thank you for being here this
[12:20] morning, Lord Jesus.
[12:23] We thank you for allowing us, Lord, to
[12:25] come in behind the veil once again, Lord
[12:28] God.
[12:29] And to sit in your presence, Lord, and
[12:31] to hear your word, Lord God,
[12:34] and just to feel, Lord, and acknowledge
[12:36] your presence is just so awesome, Lord
[12:38] God.
[12:40] We thank you, Father, for what you're
[12:42] doing, Lord God, in our lives, Lord God.
[12:46] Lord, help us not to be discouraged,
[12:48] Lord. Help us not to turn away from this
[12:52] word. Lord God, we understand at times,
[12:54] Lord, that you even send people in our
[12:57] lives, Lord, that may try to get us to
[12:59] come out of this, Lord God.
[13:02] It happened to Ruth, Lord, and it
[13:04] happened to Elisha, Lord. It even
[13:07] happened with the two prophets, Lord.
[13:10] But Lord, we want to
[13:13] just be so anchored in this word, Lord
[13:16] God, and what you're showing us that
[13:18] nothing, Lord, that Satan can do, Lord,
[13:20] and the devil can bring that will turn
[13:22] our way from us, Lord, to from you, Lord
[13:25] God. You are showing us who we are, Lord
[13:28] God. You have said in your word, Lord,
[13:31] that we are gods, Lord Jesus,
[13:35] and we are sons of God and daughters.
[13:39] So come have your will one more service,
[13:41] Lord God.
[13:43] Speak your precious word to us this
[13:45] morning, Lord God. Let nothing hinder
[13:48] that from coming forth, Lord God.
[13:51] It seems that we have quite a bit going
[13:53] on, Lord God,
[13:55] but we don't want it to deflect us,
[13:58] Lord, from our goal, Lord, of the
[14:01] rapture, Lord. Let it constantly be on
[14:03] our minds, Lord God.
[14:06] And let us serve you, Lord Jesus, like
[14:08] we're the only one going, Lord God.
[14:11] So come this morning, Lord, and bless
[14:13] our musicians, Lord Jesus.
[14:16] Bless our singers this morning, Lord
[14:18] God.
[14:21] Let us enter into that worship, Lord, in
[14:23] spirit and truth, Lord. Bless the
[14:26] congregation this morning, Lord, visible
[14:28] and not visible, Lord God.
[14:32] Give those traveling mercy that it may
[14:34] still be on the way, Lord. And touch
[14:36] those that are out this morning, Lord.
[14:40] Bless our technicians as well this
[14:42] morning, Lord God, that everything goes
[14:43] just right for you, Lord Jesus.
[14:46] And once again, Lord, bless our pastor,
[14:49] Lord, and the diligence, Lord, that he
[14:52] shows to to just receive from you, Lord,
[14:56] that he can bring it to us, Lord God.
[14:59] Bless that word, Lord. Let it be
[15:01] preeminent this morning, Lord, as we
[15:03] sing the songs of Zion this morning. Let
[15:05] us be happy, Lord. Let us be happy and
[15:09] rejoice in everything that you're doing,
[15:11] Lord. Even the things that we're not
[15:13] even aware of, Lord. Let us be happy,
[15:16] Lord. We give you every aspect of this
[15:19] service back to you, Lord, in Jesus
[15:21] Christ's name this morning. Amen. And
[15:24] amen. Can we give him a clap offering
[15:26] this morning? Amen.
[15:30] Turn around and greet your neighbor this
[15:31] morning as well. Amen. Praise God.
[16:36] [Music]
[16:51] You ask me why I'm happy and I'll just
[16:54] tell you why. Because
[16:58] my sins are gone.
[17:01] And when I meet the scoffers who ask me
[17:04] where they are, I say, "My sins are
[17:08] gone."
[17:10] Oh, they're underneath the blood on the
[17:13] cross of Calvary.
[17:15] As far removed as darkness from dawn
[17:20] in the sea of God's
[17:23] that's good enough for me. Praise God.
[17:27] My sins are gone.
[17:30] Was at the old time altar where God came
[17:33] in my heart and now my sins are gone.
[17:39] The Lord took full possession. The devil
[17:43] didn't. I'm glad
[17:46] my sins are gone.
[17:49] Guess they're underneath the blood on
[17:52] the cross of Calvary.
[17:54] As far removed as darkness from dawn
[17:59] in that sea of God's forgetfulness,
[18:01] that's good enough for me. Praise God.
[18:05] My sins are gone.
[18:08] When Satan comes to tempt me and tries
[18:11] to make me doubt, I'd say
[18:15] my sins are gone.
[18:18] You got me into trouble, but Jesus got
[18:22] me out. I'm glad my sins are gone.
[18:27] Yes, they're underneath the blood on the
[18:30] cross of Calvary.
[18:33] As far removed as darkness is from dawn.
[18:37] Oh, of God's forgetfulness. That's good
[18:40] enough for me. Praise God.
[18:44] My sins are
[18:48] nowusone
[18:51] [Music]
[19:09] of
[19:13] darkness.
[19:13] from

[27:28] it was finished, which means we're
[27:32] redeemed.

[31:47] prayer request as well. Go ahead, my
[31:49] brother.
[31:50] &gt;&gt; I'll bless you all.

[32:15] pull them up, but I also did have to
[32:17] take a um a math course over the summer
[32:21] just to be able to add another credit to
[32:24] what I already had. And we went to the

[32:49] when she checked over there and she was
[32:51] like oh I'm totally wrong.

[34:03] I'm going to read the prayer the prayer
[34:04] request list here. So, y'all grab a hold
[34:06] of one or two and hold on to them as as
[34:10] I read them and then um we'll go to the
[34:13] Lord. Um first off, um pray for
[34:16] traveling mercy for the Ishiari family,
[34:19] I guess. um returning from somewhere.
[34:23] So I see almost all of you.
[34:28] Amen. There's brother Ben back there. So

[34:45] on your trip.
[34:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:48] &gt;&gt; Yes, ma'am.
[35:04] I just wanted to say something. Uh I
[35:06] want to give thanks to God for John's
[35:07] giving him another healthy year of life.
[35:10] And uh may the Lord richly bless him.
[35:13] And I also want to make a comment. Uh
[35:15] yesterday we went to my son's uh house
[35:18] and uh to he wanted to cook a steak for
[35:20] his daddy on his birthday.
[35:23] And um
[35:26] just wanted to say something that I am
[35:28] very grateful to God for the youth that
[35:30] we have in here, you know, because uh
[35:34] some young man killed his aunt
[35:36] yesterday. He just shot her three times
[35:38] and and then he killed himself and he
[35:41] had been in prison eight years and just
[35:44] got out of prison three days before.
[35:47] So uh and a young man. So that I I was
[35:50] thinking I said that is so bad. You
[35:52] know, you go to prison for a year come
[35:54] and come out and the person that opens
[35:56] the door to you to help you, you
[35:57] shouldn't. But I just want to give
[35:59] thanks to God for the young people here
[36:01] because they have a desire in their
[36:03] heart to serve the Lord. And and as
[36:06] parents, we do try to do our best to
[36:08] raise them, right? And and we trust that
[36:10] the Lord will keep them as they grow
[36:11] into adulthood and for the Lord to
[36:13] continue to bless them.
[36:16] [Applause]
[36:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:23] &gt;&gt; Wonderful.
[36:24] So, I've I've made a list here also of
[36:27] some other things. Uh, Sister D hit the
[36:30] choir group this morning with uh uh uh
[36:33] uh something about her vocal cords.
[36:35] Bless her heart. So, she's um not going
[36:38] to be able to sing with the choir for a
[36:39] while. And as of right now, our practice
[36:42] today has been cancelled um due to sever
[36:44] several things, but um so the devil's
[36:47] attacking her and her throat and her
[36:49] voice and it's going to be you said six
[36:51] months. So, we're going to pray for
[36:54] that. Amen. Um, Sister Zatt's not here
[36:57] this this week. She's going to be in uh
[37:00] Virginia helping a family member with
[37:03] something that was going on up there.
[37:04] So, we want to just ask God to take care
[37:06] of her while she's up there. Um, as I
[37:09] mentioned, Sister Lily needs a touch in
[37:11] her body. Brother Seth as well. I want
[37:15] to um bring up Sister Angela and her
[37:17] dad, the captain, again, uh, that we
[37:20] remember them.
[37:23] Um,
[37:24] I wanted to uh remember those that are
[37:27] still on the way this morning or out uh
[37:29] for whatever reason. Amen. It just
[37:32] affects all of us when um especially if
[37:35] there's any uncertainty. Um also,
[37:37] Brother Green's meetings are this week.
[37:39] So, let's keep those in prayer. And also
[37:43] for our building project, I just thought
[37:45] of these things that maybe, you know, we
[37:47] can keep on our heart as we go to the
[37:49] Lord this morning. Brother Michael Omar,
[37:52] could you come up and pray? Let's stand
[37:54] as well.
[37:56] Amen. Yes, ma'am.
[38:02] &gt;&gt; All right.
[38:04] I I wanted to I don't want to sound
[38:07] selfish if I keep it to myself, but let
[38:09] the Lord just exercise my faith, but the
[38:12] devil's been attacking me with migraines
[38:14] about 18 days straight. I go to sleep. I
[38:18] wake up with it. Light sensitivity,
[38:20] dizziness. Um, I'm scheduled for an MRI
[38:24] on Wednesday. They don't know what's
[38:26] triggered it. It could be the heat. Um,
[38:28] but we serve a faithful God and he
[38:31] hasn't left me yet. He hasn't failed me.
[38:35] So, as bad as it hurts, I could look at
[38:37] the symptoms or I could choose to keep
[38:39] my head up and
[38:41] that's what I'm doing. So y'all just
[38:43] keep me in prayer so I can come back and
[38:46] solidify and confirm my faith with
[38:50] nothing on the MRIs and say is wrong.
[38:59] God bless you all.
[39:01] &gt;&gt; I want to conquer with my sister John
[39:05] about the youths here. We really
[39:07] appreciate you.
[39:10] I can assure you are in the right place.
[39:12] You're the best of the best.
[39:15] I work I work in places where I see
[39:18] mental cases. Right now, majority are
[39:22] young people.
[39:24] So, you wonder what's going on. So,
[39:27] please thank God that you're in the
[39:29] right mind and you're doing the right
[39:31] thing.
[39:33] And the prophet said somewhere
[39:36] that seek the Holy Ghost while you are
[39:39] in your right mind.
[39:42] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[39:43] &gt;&gt; Okay. While in your right mind so that
[39:45] when it he plays around with your head
[39:48] or your mind, you already have the Holy
[39:50] Ghost.
[39:51] &gt;&gt; Okay. Oh, let us pray. Help me to pray,
[39:54] please.
[39:56] Dear father in heaven, we come before
[39:58] you humbly.
[40:00] We love you, Father. We appreciate you.
[40:03] We thank you for all the things that you
[40:05] have done for us. Oh Lord,
[40:07] just to think that we are the bride this
[40:10] age, oh God, that takes away my breath,
[40:13] oh father, what a love is that that you
[40:16] can choose us among so many, oh father,
[40:19] that we are who we are because of you,
[40:22] oh father, and you purpose it to be so.
[40:25] We are going to make it because we have

[40:52] him another year. Father, it reminds me
[40:54] of a friend at work that always when
[40:57] asking how are you today? Is there
[40:59] another day to serve him? So Lord, you

[41:03] our father. Thank you, Jesus. Thank you
[41:06] for the mother of Sister D. Oh Lord,
[41:10] thank you for their life. I pray for the

[41:24] And there's a reason why the devil is
[41:26] trying to attack them. Lord, we refuse
[41:28] and come against the enemy that you'll
[41:31] give them help to serve you. Father, our
[41:34] sisters going for the MRI. Oh Lord, we
[41:40] claim the healing. Father, we let it
[41:42] come perfect. Oh father because healing
[41:45] comes from you because you said I sent
[41:47] my word and thy word healed them. Oh

[41:55] shares are preparing to for a trip
[41:57] father. May you cover them with your
[42:00] blood. Take care of them father until we
[42:02] meet again. And the many other needs
[42:05] that have been put across. I can't
[42:07] remember them oh lord but you are god
[42:10] who knows all things. Oh God, even the
[42:12] little things in our hearts, Father, we
[42:14] remember all of them. Oh Father, we give
[42:17] them all also to you, Father. Right now,
[42:19] Lord, I turn my page again to seek the
[42:24] face, your face for the sake of our
[42:27] pastor,
[42:28] Lord Jesus Christ. May you take him
[42:30] away, oh God, and may you use him for
[42:33] the purpose for your children. Oh
[42:34] father, you chose him for this work,
[42:37] Lord. Father, reveal yourself, Father.
[42:41] Take charge of all situation, Lord. And
[42:44] we know at the end of it, we shall be
[42:46] very, very happy. And we shall thank
[42:48] you, Father. Take the tithes and
[42:50] offerings and give them to you, Father.

[59:24] &gt;&gt; It's the same book. It's just a matter
[59:25] of you investing yourself and making
[59:28] sure you can read what is in there.
[59:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. Can you give the volume to my
[59:34] friend here so he can say amen?
[59:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[59:39] &gt;&gt; Brother Glenn, I'm still waiting on the
[59:41] next uh session for question and answer
[59:43] because we depend on the facility and
[59:45] the youngsman meeting. It's coming up
[59:48] this coming Saturday. This coming
[59:50] Saturday. It's the young men meeting
[59:52] part two for uh courtship. It's August
[59:56] the 9th and the married couple will
[59:58] follow on September the 20th for part 7
[1:00:01] and December the 13th for part 8 in
[1:00:05] young sisters meeting will be on
[1:00:07] September the 27 and we will go with it
[1:00:10] on a question and answer uh format. Uh
[1:00:14] if I have time
[1:00:16] uh we'll see how we go. If we can cover
[1:00:18] all the question fine but if uh we run
[1:00:21] out of time that's okay. But if we have
[1:00:23] time, we will probably I will not touch
[1:00:26] that on the surface because we got
[1:00:28] everything recorded with married couple
[1:00:29] meeting. So you can uh once you get
[1:00:32] ready to get married, you're going to
[1:00:33] sit and watch part one all the way to
[1:00:35] part six. And then uh but uh God's
[1:00:38] willing, we will maybe touch up a little
[1:00:41] bit on what you're trying to get into.
[1:00:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:46] &gt;&gt; Because when we say marriage, usually we
[1:00:49] excited.
[1:00:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. We looking at huggies and uh
[1:00:56] kisses.
[1:00:58] Oh,
[1:01:00] &gt;&gt; you acting like what I'm saying is
[1:01:02] coming from another world.
[1:01:04] &gt;&gt; When uh usually when we say about
[1:01:07] hugging, we're looking at uh I mean
[1:01:09] marriage, it's about hugging. I'm going
[1:01:11] to have my own husband. I'm going to hug
[1:01:13] him. We going to have sex.
[1:01:15] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:01:15] &gt;&gt; And all this type of stuff. But there is
[1:01:17] more to that into marriage.
[1:01:22] Are we together?
[1:01:23] &gt;&gt; Because when your focus is just there,
[1:01:26] &gt;&gt; then the devil will ambush you.
[1:01:31] &gt;&gt; I don't know if we together.
[1:01:34] &gt;&gt; The devil will ambush you.
[1:01:36] &gt;&gt; And then you're going to be very
[1:01:37] disappointed.
[1:01:40] &gt;&gt; After you kiss, the kisses become
[1:01:42] normal.
[1:01:43] &gt;&gt; After you hug, the hug become normal.
[1:01:46] &gt;&gt; At the beginning, it was electrical.
[1:01:49] Right. Electricity.
[1:01:51] &gt;&gt; You don't get me. Married couple knows
[1:01:53] what I'm saying.
[1:01:55] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:01:56] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:01:58] &gt;&gt; After a while, when you shake hand, it's
[1:02:00] like you shaking because you and your
[1:02:02] wife are one.
[1:02:04] &gt;&gt; The husband and the wife are one.
[1:02:06] &gt;&gt; So when you get married, you will find
[1:02:07] out that you truly are one.
[1:02:09] &gt;&gt; If you put your hand like this on your
[1:02:11] husband, you won't feel what you think
[1:02:13] you're going to be feeling.
[1:02:18] And then you begin to wonder. You say,
[1:02:20] "Well, what were they talking all about
[1:02:23] this marriage stuff?" Then the devil
[1:02:25] will ambush you.
[1:02:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:28] &gt;&gt; So marriage, brother Brandham say it's a
[1:02:30] responsibility.
[1:02:32] &gt;&gt; It's a big responsibility.
[1:02:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:02:36] &gt;&gt; So if we have time, young sister, once
[1:02:38] we finish your question, we will try to
[1:02:40] pass the infatuation a little bit.
[1:02:42] &gt;&gt; That's exactly right. Yeah. They're
[1:02:44] married and the the the the what
[1:02:46] ceremony the picture on WhatsApp for a
[1:02:49] month and then people forget about you
[1:02:51] and we don't care about your pictures
[1:02:53] anymore and you put it yourself in your
[1:02:55] home
[1:02:56] &gt;&gt; and even if when we come to visit you we
[1:02:58] don't want to see them anymore
[1:03:00] &gt;&gt; we want to see the baby
[1:03:03] &gt;&gt; we want to see the children then life
[1:03:06] begin to change and take a different
[1:03:08] meaning amen so Lord's willing we will
[1:03:11] get into that so I will prepare your
[1:03:13] expectation a little bit.
[1:03:15] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because young sister are like,
[1:03:17] "Uh, when is the day, Lord? When is the
[1:03:20] day?" And the brother, "When is the
[1:03:22] day?" No, no, no. Let me clean up that
[1:03:25] uh stuff a little bit. Let me open the
[1:03:28] curtain a little bit.
[1:03:29] &gt;&gt; I won't open too much. You you you need
[1:03:31] to get past uh uh engagement, then we
[1:03:36] give you all the video. Amen. But I will
[1:03:39] open up a little curtain like they did
[1:03:40] for brother Brham and you can begin to
[1:03:43] see a little bit what is there. You say,
[1:03:44] "Oh my God." So this is what marriage is
[1:03:48] all about. Then it will help you refocus
[1:03:50] and pray more sincerely.
[1:03:52] &gt;&gt; That's exactly right.
[1:03:54] &gt;&gt; Because you're going to deal with him or
[1:03:56] her the rest of your life.
[1:04:01] And if you made a bad decision because
[1:04:04] you didn't listen to your pastor,
[1:04:08] &gt;&gt; he's not going to die quickly.
[1:04:11] &gt;&gt; That that that wrong woman won't die
[1:04:14] quickly. That wrong husband doesn't die
[1:04:16] quickly.
[1:04:17] &gt;&gt; You will suffer. God will make sure you
[1:04:19] get it.
[1:04:24] &gt;&gt; Are we together? So I need to sit down
[1:04:27] and open a little curtain and let you
[1:04:29] see the curtain. So when you're praying,
[1:04:31] when you're talking to a young man, when
[1:04:33] you're talking to a young sister, make
[1:04:35] sure you using all the radar.
[1:04:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:04:38] &gt;&gt; You remember the bubble of the Pepsi.
[1:04:40] Forget about all the Bubbles. Just when
[1:04:42] when when he approaches you, he say,
[1:04:44] "You look like my bubble in the Pepsi.
[1:04:45] Take that in the trash."
[1:04:47] &gt;&gt; Keep focused.
[1:04:48] &gt;&gt; I love you. You're the best woman in the
[1:04:50] entire world. In the trash.
[1:04:52] &gt;&gt; I'm not the best in the entire world.
[1:04:54] There are many other women. Go ahead and
[1:04:56] talk. I want to know what you have.
[1:04:59] &gt;&gt; I want to see your contract.
[1:05:01] &gt;&gt; What do you have on the paper?
[1:05:04] &gt;&gt; Because there are women there are women
[1:05:06] that more that are more beautiful than
[1:05:08] you.
[1:05:09] &gt;&gt; But he's trying to make you think that
[1:05:10] you more beautiful than everybody.
[1:05:18] &gt;&gt; You don't you don't want to deal with
[1:05:20] fact. Good luck. You're going to face
[1:05:21] it.
[1:05:22] &gt;&gt; Are we together? So whatever comes, oh
[1:05:25] you like the moon for me. When I see
[1:05:26] you, I can't sleep. Put daddy in the
[1:05:28] trash because when he will see you, he
[1:05:30] will begin to sleep and snore.
[1:05:36] &gt;&gt; Married people knows what I'm talking
[1:05:37] about.
[1:05:38] &gt;&gt; So forget about put them in the tri
[1:05:41] focus.
[1:05:42] &gt;&gt; And if you a young sister, look for the
[1:05:44] head.
[1:05:46] &gt;&gt; Look for Christ in that man.
[1:05:49] &gt;&gt; If Christ is in there, that's it.
[1:05:51] &gt;&gt; That's right. If you a young brother,
[1:05:53] look for character.
[1:05:55] &gt;&gt; Not your character, but the character of
[1:05:57] Christ.
[1:05:58] &gt;&gt; So both the man and the woman are
[1:06:01] looking for Christ in each other. And if
[1:06:04] Christ is in the young man, Christ is in
[1:06:06] the young sister, it's going to be
[1:06:08] Christ marrying Christ.
[1:06:10] Then whatever situation will come in
[1:06:12] your life, God the trust in you will
[1:06:15] master it and correct it and focus and
[1:06:18] keep you blended together until we meet
[1:06:21] the Lord in the air. Any question, my
[1:06:24] friend.
[1:06:29] &gt;&gt; I'm telling you all this. I wish
[1:06:30] somebody told me all of this.
[1:06:32] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:06:32] &gt;&gt; Amen, brother.
[1:06:34] &gt;&gt; We sat in the church for years and
[1:06:36] nobody's talking about marriage.
[1:06:38] &gt;&gt; Nobody. And before you know it,
[1:06:41] &gt;&gt; no no no preparation. You guys got
[1:06:42] preparation.
[1:06:43] &gt;&gt; You got preparation on finances, on
[1:06:45] sexuality, on this. We didn't get
[1:06:47] anything.
[1:06:48] &gt;&gt; We got nothing.
[1:06:50] &gt;&gt; But but but but an instinct is there to
[1:06:53] get married.
[1:06:57] &gt;&gt; We get married blind.
[1:07:01] &gt;&gt; Blind
[1:07:02] &gt;&gt; filled with all garbage from the world
[1:07:05] &gt;&gt; that the message have to clean up again.
[1:07:08] Amen.
[1:07:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:09] &gt;&gt; And you hear young people in the
[1:07:11] message, especially young couple, oh,
[1:07:13] nobody can tell you how to live with
[1:07:15] your wife. It's no no God there because
[1:07:18] they were natur
[1:07:20] &gt;&gt; because the pastor focus on one thing.
[1:07:23] &gt;&gt; A pastor is multitasking.
[1:07:25] &gt;&gt; That's correct.
[1:07:28] &gt;&gt; It's a shepherd.
[1:07:33] &gt;&gt; Amen, brother.
[1:07:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:07:37] &gt;&gt; Pastor doesn't stop at the pulpit.
[1:07:40] &gt;&gt; Pastor goes, matter of fact, a pulpit
[1:07:43] even a preacher can preach.
[1:07:45] &gt;&gt; A pastor is beyond pulpit.
[1:07:50] &gt;&gt; The pastor is more invisible than the
[1:07:52] visible.
[1:07:53] &gt;&gt; His work is more invisible.
[1:07:55] &gt;&gt; In the hospital, in the question and
[1:07:57] answer, everywhere the pastor is there.
[1:08:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. But we made pastor like pulp it
[1:08:05] &gt;&gt; leave go home get a paycheck tithing
[1:08:08] &gt;&gt; and guess what very good
[1:08:10] &gt;&gt; free money
[1:08:12] I learn 20 preachers you sit down
[1:08:16] &gt;&gt; is that a pastorial
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; no sir
[1:08:19] &gt;&gt; and before you know it the church is
[1:08:20] growing up without any balance
[1:08:23] &gt;&gt; for years
[1:08:25] &gt;&gt; because the pastor taught he's preaching
[1:08:27] and he goes home
[1:08:29] &gt;&gt; amen Amen.
[1:08:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:08:32] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:08:34] &gt;&gt; So that's young sisters meeting on this.
[1:08:36] If you do good, will you save my time?
[1:08:39] Amen. Because my time have not started.
[1:08:41] Young sisters meeting on September the
[1:08:43] 27. Amen. And then as far as uh uh the
[1:08:48] contribution link, so basically to the
[1:08:51] best that I get from the
[1:08:54] from the technician YouTube link is no
[1:08:58] longer uh alive for those that are
[1:09:00] following me online that have requested
[1:09:03] it. So the only way you have to do is
[1:09:05] copy the link and paste it to your own
[1:09:08] computer or your own cell phone. then
[1:09:10] the link will be active and you can make
[1:09:13] a contribution to the breeding project
[1:09:15] if you want to on other side we are
[1:09:18] investigating to see if we can put a
[1:09:20] PayPal online so at that point wherever
[1:09:23] you are you just deal with PayPal
[1:09:25] because we want to make make sure
[1:09:27] everything goes through the security of
[1:09:29] the United States so we're not liable
[1:09:31] for anything because I don't want any
[1:09:33] problem that my credit card was done
[1:09:35] this this you deal with PayPal and not
[1:09:37] me everybody okay so you give me some uh
[1:09:40] some week or something. As soon as we
[1:09:43] get everything for the security of the
[1:09:44] paper, we know it. But on a meanwhile,
[1:09:47] because there are people doing that
[1:09:48] internationally, you can use the link,
[1:09:50] just copy it on your computer or on your
[1:09:53] cell phone and you can use it if you
[1:09:56] want to give contribution. So I hope for
[1:09:58] the invisible audience I have answered
[1:10:01] your question. And once you see PayPal,
[1:10:02] you know everything is okay. Because
[1:10:04] we're trying to get PayPal for a
[1:10:07] nonprofit organization because if it's a
[1:10:09] a profit organization, then we got to
[1:10:11] pay fees. So, we need to go in a way
[1:10:13] where the fees are a little bit lower
[1:10:15] because we want to be good steward of
[1:10:17] God's money. Amen.
[1:10:19] &gt;&gt; Sister Sharon had to travel uh quickly.
[1:10:22] There's two ways uh two things that
[1:10:24] happened to the trip. Her father was not
[1:10:26] feeling good, but it's uh a little bit
[1:10:28] better by God's grace. And number two, I
[1:10:30] was invited to a big dedication back
[1:10:33] home. So there is a big church, a
[1:10:36] pastor. He actually was the one that
[1:10:38] introduced the message to my wife
[1:10:41] family. So he's a good a good pastor, a
[1:10:44] wonderful elder, big huge church. They
[1:10:46] finished the church. So they want me to
[1:10:48] be part of it to preach. But at this
[1:10:50] time the season is different for me. I
[1:10:53] cannot move. So she went to do two
[1:10:55] things. Handle the father situation and
[1:10:57] go into the business. So she's
[1:10:59] representing spoken word over there. So
[1:11:02] whatever she's doing, she's saying I'm
[1:11:03] representing spoken word. I'm
[1:11:05] representing spoken word. Amen.
[1:11:10] So Lord's willing, you pray for her
[1:11:12] because she need to she will be making
[1:11:14] up uh uh coming back this week. She had
[1:11:17] a rough time a little bit going back uh
[1:11:19] uh going straight and there was a delay
[1:11:23] uh get to the airport. Thank God we got
[1:11:25] a quick ticket quickly. But uh to
[1:11:27] everything there is a purpose.
[1:11:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:31] &gt;&gt; She get to parish for some reason her
[1:11:33] ticket cancel.
[1:11:36] &gt;&gt; And the confirmation was there. So we
[1:11:38] have to call the company. They say no we
[1:11:40] need to buy a ticket right there. So I
[1:11:42] have to get online and work quickly get
[1:11:44] another ticket quickly and send it. And
[1:11:47] she got the ticket but she had to stay
[1:11:49] at the airport to meet to get the second
[1:11:51] flight in the morning. So she stayed
[1:11:53] there for so long. And you say why is
[1:11:55] all of this? You remember Rof going to
[1:11:58] the land of Judah and now you begin to
[1:12:00] understand that all of that happened for
[1:12:02] a purpose. So while she was sitting at
[1:12:04] the airport, here come a Muslim lady
[1:12:07] walking straight and moving. No son or
[1:12:10] just a normal young lady moving and
[1:12:13] going around. And something told my wife
[1:12:15] that woman is pregnant and she's in
[1:12:17] pain. And she's in pain in that spot
[1:12:20] right there. And show her exactly the
[1:12:22] spot. And the woman keep looking at my
[1:12:24] wife. And my wife say, "Why are you
[1:12:26] looking at me?" You know, she say
[1:12:28] Sheron, "Why are you looking at me and
[1:12:30] smiling?"
[1:12:32] Amen. And the woman came straight to
[1:12:34] her. She say, "Something is telling me
[1:12:36] that you're in pain. You are pregnant."
[1:12:38] And nothing shows that the woman was
[1:12:40] pregnant. The woman said, "That's
[1:12:42] exactly correct. How do you know?"
[1:12:45] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:12:45] &gt;&gt; he said something told me and the pain
[1:12:48] is happening here. And she said, "Yes, I
[1:12:50] came here for vacation. I can't even
[1:12:52] enjoy the vacation because of the
[1:12:54] pregnancy. So in other words, it was
[1:12:56] like something bad that happened to her.
[1:12:58] And my wife picked up from there and
[1:13:00] begin to admonish her of the blessing of
[1:13:02] having a child. And she called her
[1:13:04] husband. She said, "Come and listen to
[1:13:06] this." And everything was bullseye and
[1:13:08] chain. She even gave her the number. She
[1:13:11] said, "Let's stay in contact." And they
[1:13:13] even took a picture. So God stopped her
[1:13:15] for just one person.
[1:13:17] [Applause]
[1:13:21] Amen. So whatever is happening in your
[1:13:24] life, chill out.
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; God knows what he's doing.
[1:13:28] &gt;&gt; It might not be for you, but it might be
[1:13:31] for something else or somebody else. And
[1:13:33] God is using you to be a blessing to
[1:13:35] someone else.
[1:13:36] &gt;&gt; Everything is working together for what?
[1:13:40] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:13:41] &gt;&gt; So you ready for the word?
[1:13:43] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. So let's stand for the
[1:13:45] reading of the word and flight attendant
[1:13:47] prepare for takeoff.
[1:13:51] The devil have fought us so much in this
[1:13:53] sermon right here. Amen. So you bear
[1:13:58] with me and we see how far we can go
[1:14:01] because every time I stop things
[1:14:03] continue to open up. Continue to open
[1:14:05] up. God bless you my sister there. I
[1:14:07] don't know the name but I see you. God
[1:14:09] bless you and welcome to Spoken Word
[1:14:11] Tabernacle. God bless you my sister
[1:14:13] right there. God bless you.
[1:14:17] [Applause]
[1:14:19] You're not a visitor. You're a family
[1:14:21] member. So here we say amen. We rejoice.
[1:14:24] We shout. Amen.
[1:14:25] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. My subject this morning is
[1:14:29] our life journey
[1:14:32] through Joseph 5 garment part 72.
[1:14:37] Amen.
[1:14:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. I have a minister I believe in
[1:14:41] India. He's following roof. He's going
[1:14:43] one, two, three, four, five and he's
[1:14:45] using and and he even told me the
[1:14:47] missing part
[1:14:49] [Laughter]
[1:14:51] online. I was not even aware of. We need
[1:14:53] to try to figure
[1:14:55] the subject if we would try to get into
[1:14:57] it. It's taking advantage.
[1:15:00] This is the third time.
[1:15:03] Taking advantage.
[1:15:07] Now you already memorize
[1:15:10] of what
[1:15:11] &gt;&gt; season.
[1:15:11] &gt;&gt; The season.
[1:15:13] &gt;&gt; I hope we can catch into this but it's
[1:15:15] deep and it's really
[1:15:18] big and you need your scripture. So
[1:15:21] let's pray. Heavenly Father, Lord, we
[1:15:25] approaching you humbly again this
[1:15:27] morning. Father, thanking you for your
[1:15:29] grace, your love, your mercy, and for
[1:15:32] everything you have been doing for us.
[1:15:34] Father, this is as far as we can go with
[1:15:36] the ability you have given to us. But
[1:15:39] when it comes to ministering your word,
[1:15:41] you only take the supernatural action of
[1:15:44] the Holy Spirit because man cannot
[1:15:46] divide properly your word. Only you God
[1:15:49] who is the author of the word can do it,
[1:15:52] Lord. Father, may you help the visible
[1:15:54] and invisible audience. May you
[1:15:56] strengthen us and remove every spirit of
[1:15:58] destruction. May we stay focused. May
[1:16:01] you come down in the power of
[1:16:02] resurrection and speak to our soul
[1:16:04] again. We commit everything unto thy
[1:16:07] hand Lord Father and we humbly ask it in
[1:16:09] the name of Jesus Christ. Amen.
[1:16:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:13] &gt;&gt; Let's go to the book of Proverb chapter
[1:16:15] 6 because that's what we read last
[1:16:17] Sunday and we were unable to preach. We
[1:16:20] were only reading the holy scripture.
[1:16:22] Amen.
[1:16:25] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:16:27] &gt;&gt; If you dare, you can say amen. I
[1:16:32] &gt;&gt; was talking to folks yesterday, last
[1:16:34] night. I say make a habit, especially
[1:16:37] the young one, go back and relisten to
[1:16:39] the sermon.
[1:16:41] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; And you will see how many things you
[1:16:43] miss yourself.
[1:16:45] &gt;&gt; Even myself, every time I preach, I have
[1:16:47] to go sit down and listen. And then I
[1:16:49] learn again more from just listening.
[1:16:51] Because what you're getting is two
[1:16:53] sermon in one.
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; So if you think you're getting
[1:16:56] everything in one day, you're fooling
[1:16:58] yourself.
[1:16:58] &gt;&gt; That's right. And after seven months,
[1:17:00] you're going to ask me a question and I
[1:17:02] will tell you, go back over there and
[1:17:03] look at slide 25 and you're going to
[1:17:06] find it right there because you thought
[1:17:07] you got everything together.
[1:17:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:10] &gt;&gt; So the Sunday sermon are two sermon in
[1:17:13] one.
[1:17:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:17] &gt;&gt; All right. Proverb 6. Let me see if we
[1:17:20] will preach today. If you don't do good,
[1:17:22] that's your problem.
[1:17:24] &gt;&gt; Amen. Me, I don't have a problem.
[1:17:27] &gt;&gt; We don't.
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:30] This stuff is more than
[1:17:34] 120 quotes that are sitting here that I
[1:17:36] have to deliver.
[1:17:40] &gt;&gt; So sermon are going with two quotes.
[1:17:42] Three quotes. Three. So when are we
[1:17:43] going to reach 100? So you need to
[1:17:47] loosen up and let's move. Amen.
[1:17:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:51] &gt;&gt; Proverbs 6 verse uh six. If you there
[1:17:54] you can say amen.
[1:17:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. The Bible says this, that go to
[1:17:59] the end, you might be seated.
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; You who?
[1:18:03] &gt;&gt; Slugger.
[1:18:04] &gt;&gt; You know what it means, right?
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; If you were there, so you preach with me
[1:18:07] so we can get moving. Slagger means
[1:18:09] what?
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; Lazy.
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; Ah, glory to God.
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; Go to the end. You lazy.
[1:18:17] Consider its ways and do what?
[1:18:20] &gt;&gt; Be wise.
[1:18:21] &gt;&gt; So one way to get wisdom is to do what?
[1:18:24] Look at the ant.
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; So there is a wisdom that is connected
[1:18:29] to the ant.
[1:18:31] &gt;&gt; Or there is a wisdom that you only find
[1:18:34] at the end.
[1:18:34] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:18:36] &gt;&gt; I don't care how big you are.
[1:18:38] &gt;&gt; You need to humble yourself
[1:18:40] &gt;&gt; to go down and see what an ant is doing.
[1:18:44] &gt;&gt; So ant are connected to wisdom. And last
[1:18:47] Sunday we we found that the Bible even
[1:18:50] said that they are exceedingly wise.
[1:18:53] &gt;&gt; You remember that? Anyway, I'm going to
[1:18:55] read it again.
[1:18:57] &gt;&gt; Exceedingly they are wise.
[1:19:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:01] &gt;&gt; So, ants are connected
[1:19:04] to uh to a wisdom.
[1:19:09] &gt;&gt; Wisdom. Oh, glory to God.
[1:19:15] Some of these stuff, if I learned them
[1:19:17] earlier, I will be far away than where I
[1:19:20] am today. Amen.
[1:19:24] So in other words, young people, pay
[1:19:25] attention.
[1:19:27] &gt;&gt; He say, uh, go to the ant house. Amen.
[1:19:31] You slugger. Consider it ways and be
[1:19:34] what?
[1:19:34] &gt;&gt; Wise.
[1:19:37] &gt;&gt; What happened to the ant? Verse seven.
[1:19:39] Which have what?
[1:19:40] &gt;&gt; No guide.
[1:19:41] &gt;&gt; Are we together? And what?
[1:19:42] &gt;&gt; Overseer.
[1:19:43] &gt;&gt; Or what?
[1:19:44] &gt;&gt; Ruler.
[1:19:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:48] The Bible says that the ant
[1:19:51] has no guide.
[1:19:53] [Music]
[1:19:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:19:57] &gt;&gt; No overseer,
[1:20:00] no ruler.
[1:20:02] Amen.
[1:20:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:04] &gt;&gt; Why is the scripture so specific about
[1:20:07] uh ant not having a ruler?
[1:20:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because last Sunday we found out
[1:20:13] that no guide, no overseer, no ruler
[1:20:17] means that there is nobody there to
[1:20:20] control
[1:20:23] &gt;&gt; to push the ant
[1:20:25] &gt;&gt; to supervise.
[1:20:26] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:20:27] &gt;&gt; To inflict discipline.
[1:20:29] &gt;&gt; That's right. That's correct, brother.
[1:20:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:31] &gt;&gt; On what the ant is doing.
[1:20:34] &gt;&gt; In other words, the ant appear
[1:20:36] physically to be an independent
[1:20:38] creature.
[1:20:39] &gt;&gt; Yes. Yes.
[1:20:42] Amen.
[1:20:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:43] &gt;&gt; And yet the ant is wise.
[1:20:47] &gt;&gt; How can an independent creature be wise?
[1:20:50] &gt;&gt; That's good. Amen. Amen.
[1:20:52] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:20:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:54] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:20:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:55] &gt;&gt; In other words, the ant doesn't need
[1:20:57] somebody to be there
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; for them to do work.
[1:21:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:03] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Yes.
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; Whether the person is there or the
[1:21:07] person is not there,
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; the ant is fine.
[1:21:10] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:21:11] &gt;&gt; Whether the supervisor is there,
[1:21:14] &gt;&gt; or whether the supervisor is not there,
[1:21:16] I'm putting that in our terminology so
[1:21:18] we understand whether the manager is
[1:21:21] there or the manager is not there.
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:23] &gt;&gt; Whether there is a camera,
[1:21:26] &gt;&gt; camera.
[1:21:26] &gt;&gt; Oh, there is no camera. Amen.
[1:21:29] &gt;&gt; If you tell the ant to to accomplish a
[1:21:32] specific task, the ant will do it.
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. This is the reason why Paul says
[1:21:38] this in the book of Philippian chapter
[1:21:40] 2:12.
[1:21:42] The Bible say that Paul say that
[1:21:44] wherefore my beloved as you have how
[1:21:47] &gt;&gt; always obeyed
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; they are they are obeying when
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; always
[1:21:51] &gt;&gt; sometime
[1:21:52] &gt;&gt; no
[1:21:53] &gt;&gt; this Christian be obey how many time?
[1:21:55] always
[1:21:56] &gt;&gt; always obey not as in my presence only.
[1:22:01] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:22:03] &gt;&gt; But now much more when
[1:22:05] &gt;&gt; in my absence
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; Paul is Paul is praising these believers
[1:22:10] that they are not obeying Paul the
[1:22:12] messenger only when Paul is there.
[1:22:15] &gt;&gt; Because some people behave right when
[1:22:17] the pastor is around.
[1:22:22] &gt;&gt; Don't worry my friend. Some people
[1:22:24] behave good when the parents are around.
[1:22:27] &gt;&gt; If the parent are not around and the
[1:22:30] camera is not there,
[1:22:32] &gt;&gt; it's a disaster.
[1:22:34] &gt;&gt; So they must have the parent all the
[1:22:36] time
[1:22:37] &gt;&gt; in order for them to behave correctly.
[1:22:40] &gt;&gt; But the ant doesn't need it. And Paul is
[1:22:43] speaking about this believer and Paul is
[1:22:45] saying that these believer are more in
[1:22:48] tune when Paul is not even there.
[1:22:52] In other words, they are more in tune in
[1:22:54] the absence of the messenger.
[1:22:58] &gt;&gt; When the pastor is not there, when you
[1:23:00] are in school,
[1:23:02] &gt;&gt; when you are at your work,
[1:23:04] &gt;&gt; you behave more like a Christian than
[1:23:06] you do when you are in church.
[1:23:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:23:12] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:23:13] &gt;&gt; If we want to see your Christianity is
[1:23:15] out there.
[1:23:16] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:23:16] &gt;&gt; Over here, there is an order already.
[1:23:19] But we want to see your Christianity at
[1:23:21] work,
[1:23:22] &gt;&gt; your Christianity on the highway,
[1:23:24] &gt;&gt; your Christianity at the restaurant,
[1:23:27] &gt;&gt; your Christianity in school where there
[1:23:29] is no parent, no one.
[1:23:31] &gt;&gt; That's when you need to show your
[1:23:33] colors.
[1:23:35] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:23:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:37] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:38] &gt;&gt; If you notice, that's how you can
[1:23:40] refocus. The Bible says that the ant has
[1:23:44] no guide. He has no overseer and no
[1:23:47] ruler. There is a reason why the
[1:23:49] scripture is pointing this out because
[1:23:52] almost every animal
[1:23:55] &gt;&gt; in the animal kingdom they have a ruler.
[1:24:00] &gt;&gt; Follow me carefully.
[1:24:02] &gt;&gt; Every in the if you go in a pride which
[1:24:05] is uh which is a group of a lion you
[1:24:08] will see there is a leader there.
[1:24:09] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:24:10] &gt;&gt; If you go among the elephant you will
[1:24:12] see there is a leader.
[1:24:13] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:24:13] &gt;&gt; If you go among the crocodile they have
[1:24:15] a leader. Almost every kingdom, animal
[1:24:18] kingdom have a leader.
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; But for some reason, the ant doesn't
[1:24:22] have a leader.
[1:24:25] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen.
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; Because the way society, our structure,
[1:24:29] you have a ruler.
[1:24:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:32] &gt;&gt; And then you have the subject,
[1:24:35] &gt;&gt; correct?
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; That are working together. Amen. But the
[1:24:38] problem, the ruler is supposed to be the
[1:24:40] head.
[1:24:43] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:24:43] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:24:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. But the scripture is saying that
[1:24:46] the ant has no head.
[1:24:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:51] &gt;&gt; I I hope we together.
[1:24:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:53] &gt;&gt; Did you sleep well?
[1:24:55] &gt;&gt; The scripture is saying that the ant has
[1:24:57] no head.
[1:24:58] &gt;&gt; The ant has no ruler. The ant has no
[1:25:02] president.
[1:25:04] &gt;&gt; If we can put it to our terminology, he
[1:25:07] has no king.
[1:25:08] &gt;&gt; Even
[1:25:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:11] &gt;&gt; The ant doesn't need it.
[1:25:16] So how are they functioning?
[1:25:21] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:25:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:23] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Brother Brham says this
[1:25:27] when it comes to animal. Brother Brham
[1:25:30] says in the message God's provided way
[1:25:32] for this day. He says remember what do
[1:25:36] we remember? The education
[1:25:39] would not be the instrument to lead them
[1:25:42] to God's provided place.
[1:25:44] &gt;&gt; Talking about animal, brother Brham says
[1:25:47] that if you go to a pond
[1:25:49] &gt;&gt; where there is a lot of ducks,
[1:25:52] &gt;&gt; if you need the coach, you can see me.
[1:25:54] Brother Brandham said that when winter
[1:25:56] begin to come,
[1:25:58] &gt;&gt; do you follow me?
[1:25:59] &gt;&gt; Among the duck,
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; follow me, my friend.
[1:26:03] &gt;&gt; There will be one of them,
[1:26:06] &gt;&gt; right? that when everybody is saying
[1:26:08] it's hot
[1:26:10] &gt;&gt; right
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; that one is saying it's a little bit
[1:26:13] chilly
[1:26:17] &gt;&gt; are we together
[1:26:18] &gt;&gt; and then he appear as being odd
[1:26:21] &gt;&gt; yes
[1:26:23] brother
[1:26:23] &gt;&gt; among all the community
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; it seems like he's saying things that
[1:26:28] everybody else doesn't feel
[1:26:31] &gt;&gt; I'm still reading the Bible my friend
[1:26:33] are we together
[1:26:34] &gt;&gt; then suddenly The duck understand.
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Brandham say he will
[1:26:40] &gt;&gt; honk.
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; Come on.
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham said once he walk
[1:26:46] &gt;&gt; all the ducks
[1:26:48] &gt;&gt; do you follow me
[1:26:49] &gt;&gt; that are in that pond
[1:26:52] &gt;&gt; understand that this is the needed.
[1:26:59] &gt;&gt; Nobody did the vote.
[1:27:01] &gt;&gt; No sir.
[1:27:02] &gt;&gt; No sir.
[1:27:04] because you don't want to take off. You
[1:27:06] need to be with me so we can leave the
[1:27:07] airport.
[1:27:08] &gt;&gt; Nobody need a vote,
[1:27:10] &gt;&gt; but they analyze the leader by the
[1:27:13] ability to see the future.
[1:27:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:19] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:27:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:20] &gt;&gt; The ability to see past the present
[1:27:22] time.
[1:27:25] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:27:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:26] &gt;&gt; And suddenly all of them will gather
[1:27:28] together around the duck, the chief
[1:27:31] duck. And brother Brandham say he would
[1:27:33] take off
[1:27:36] &gt;&gt; without a compass.
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; Exactly.
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; I'm trying to land so we can go
[1:27:43] &gt;&gt; without an instrument.
[1:27:46] &gt;&gt; They don't need the weather man.
[1:27:47] &gt;&gt; No sir.
[1:27:49] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham say matter of fact
[1:27:52] &gt;&gt; those duck knows more than the weather
[1:27:55] man in the television.
[1:27:59] &gt;&gt; Yes sir. Amen.
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; They don't need no instrument
[1:28:03] &gt;&gt; to tell them or to measure what is
[1:28:05] coming up.
[1:28:06] &gt;&gt; But for some reason, the leader will
[1:28:09] rise up.
[1:28:11] &gt;&gt; Do you follow me?
[1:28:12] &gt;&gt; And every single ant will follow the
[1:28:15] leader. And brother Brown saying it go
[1:28:17] straight to Louisiana.
[1:28:19] &gt;&gt; Never leave.
[1:28:22] &gt;&gt; Never miss. No GPS.
[1:28:24] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham saying when they go
[1:28:26] there, they land on the rice field.
[1:28:28] &gt;&gt; That's it. where there is again food.
[1:28:30] &gt;&gt; Who told
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; the leader
[1:28:33] &gt;&gt; the direction of Louisiana?
[1:28:35] &gt;&gt; Come on now.
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; Lord,
[1:28:38] &gt;&gt; who told the leader the specific spot
[1:28:43] &gt;&gt; where rice is in Louisiana?
[1:28:45] &gt;&gt; And brother say all of them were born
[1:28:48] right there.
[1:28:49] &gt;&gt; They never even been in Louisiana
[1:28:51] before.
[1:28:52] &gt;&gt; But when the time come
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; when the leader begin to seize the
[1:28:57] season,
[1:28:58] Instead of bickering and fussing
[1:29:00] together, brother Brandham said they
[1:29:02] have a meeting in the pond
[1:29:04] &gt;&gt; and suddenly the leader take off
[1:29:07] &gt;&gt; and every duck begin to follow him
[1:29:10] &gt;&gt; all the way to the destination. What is
[1:29:13] in the duck?
[1:29:17] &gt;&gt; Who is directing the duck?
[1:29:21] &gt;&gt; Are we together? So remember the duck
[1:29:24] have a leader
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; and they are following the leader
[1:29:28] &gt;&gt; but the ant are more sitting wise
[1:29:32] &gt;&gt; they don't have a leader
[1:29:34] &gt;&gt; I'm going somewhere
[1:29:36] [Applause]
[1:29:37] &gt;&gt; I am going somewhere
[1:29:39] &gt;&gt; the lion have a leader
[1:29:42] &gt;&gt; the goat have a leader
[1:29:44] &gt;&gt; but the ant don't have a leader and yet
[1:29:46] they behave differently sir
[1:29:49] &gt;&gt; what are you trying to say brother Even
[1:29:52] &gt;&gt; we're still at the airport. I'm waiting
[1:29:53] for the next flight so I can take off.
[1:29:55] Okay, my friend.
[1:29:56] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham say this is why brother
[1:29:58] Braham say remember the education will
[1:30:01] not be the instrument to lead them.
[1:30:04] &gt;&gt; They don't need to go to college.
[1:30:07] &gt;&gt; They don't need no degree. They don't
[1:30:08] even need elementary school.
[1:30:11] &gt;&gt; They are depending on something that is
[1:30:13] leading them. What is that something
[1:30:17] brother Brown? I'm saying the instrument
[1:30:20] they have is what?
[1:30:21] &gt;&gt; Instinct.
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; There it is. There it is. Amen.
[1:30:25] &gt;&gt; So in the duck
[1:30:27] when a duck is born, God take a GPS.
[1:30:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:34] &gt;&gt; If you if you preach with me, we move
[1:30:36] on.
[1:30:40] &gt;&gt; Remember animal have no souls.
[1:30:42] &gt;&gt; We already went through that.
[1:30:44] &gt;&gt; Soul is only found in human beings.
[1:30:46] That's why the Bible say in the ark of
[1:30:48] Noah only eight soul
[1:30:51] &gt;&gt; were saved but the animal were there
[1:30:53] &gt;&gt; because animal don't have soul.
[1:30:56] &gt;&gt; So because animal don't have soul
[1:30:58] &gt;&gt; God gave them instinct.
[1:31:01] &gt;&gt; Are you are we together?
[1:31:03] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; So if this is animal right here
[1:31:09] oh this is the ant. Whichever one you
[1:31:11] want to put in inside the end there is
[1:31:14] something there that God put and that
[1:31:17] thing is called instinct.
[1:31:20] &gt;&gt; Follow me my friend.
[1:31:23] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:25] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham said this instinct
[1:31:27] here is the instrument
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; that God he gave the duck.
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; Yes. or the goat or whichever because
[1:31:36] brotherham say even in England uh in
[1:31:38] India when the earthquake was coming up
[1:31:42] only human being died
[1:31:45] &gt;&gt; amen
[1:31:47] brother say no animal dies
[1:31:49] &gt;&gt; for some reason they noticed before the
[1:31:51] earthquake all the goat were running
[1:31:53] away from the wall
[1:31:56] &gt;&gt; and the human being are still going to
[1:31:58] sleep inside the wall
[1:32:02] &gt;&gt; so who is that
[1:32:05] Amen.
[1:32:06] &gt;&gt; Who sin in the Garden of
[1:32:07] &gt;&gt; Eden?
[1:32:08] &gt;&gt; It is man, not the animal. Are we
[1:32:11] together?
[1:32:11] &gt;&gt; So man has a problem with connection to
[1:32:15] the leader.
[1:32:19] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:32:20] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:32:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:22] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:32:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:23] &gt;&gt; But when the earthquake happened, no
[1:32:26] bird, all of them ran away.
[1:32:28] &gt;&gt; Everybody was safe because of what?
[1:32:30] Because they are using the instinct.
[1:32:32] Amen.
[1:32:33] &gt;&gt; We clear now.
[1:32:35] &gt;&gt; We clear now.
[1:32:36] &gt;&gt; So ant also
[1:32:38] &gt;&gt; has instinct.
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; We clear.
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; But the problem they don't have no
[1:32:44] president.
[1:32:46] &gt;&gt; The duck have a president. The zebra
[1:32:48] have a president. The buck have a
[1:32:51] president. The elk have a president. But
[1:32:54] the ant does have no president. What
[1:32:56] does he mean?
[1:32:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:58] &gt;&gt; The duck. Follow me my friend. God gave
[1:33:02] them the instinct brother said and they
[1:33:06] them ducks know that that instinct would
[1:33:09] take them to water.
[1:33:10] &gt;&gt; God's provided a place.
[1:33:11] &gt;&gt; So in other word God who is in the
[1:33:14] universe
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; in nature operate through the instinct.
[1:33:19] Do you follow me?
[1:33:20] &gt;&gt; Of the leader.
[1:33:22] &gt;&gt; Yes. Right.
[1:33:24] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:33:26] &gt;&gt; Then the leader goes to the followers.
[1:33:30] Amen. Amen.
[1:33:32] &gt;&gt; Yes sir. Yes sir.
[1:33:33] &gt;&gt; Do you follow me?
[1:33:34] &gt;&gt; I'm in a surgery my friend. We got
[1:33:36] followers or we got subject
[1:33:39] &gt;&gt; or we got disciple whatever you want to
[1:33:41] call it. So the followers are looking to
[1:33:43] the leader.
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; And the leader have an instinct.
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; Just as the follower also have an
[1:33:49] instinct.
[1:33:50] &gt;&gt; Do you follow me?
[1:33:51] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:33:51] &gt;&gt; So between the followers
[1:33:54] &gt;&gt; Uh-huh.
[1:33:55] &gt;&gt; Are we together? and God. There is
[1:33:58] somebody in between.
[1:34:04] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:34:05] &gt;&gt; Have I lost you? If I lost you, raise
[1:34:07] your hand.
[1:34:09] &gt;&gt; Okay. Two up there.
[1:34:11] &gt;&gt; Let me start it again, my friend.
[1:34:13] &gt;&gt; I'm going to start it again. Whoever was
[1:34:16] shy, you also included.
[1:34:18] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:34:19] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen.
[1:34:22] &gt;&gt; God gave animal instinct
[1:34:25] &gt;&gt; because they don't have soul.
[1:34:27] &gt;&gt; If not, the animal will not know how to
[1:34:29] live.
[1:34:30] &gt;&gt; So God must protect and get into nature
[1:34:33] to be a good and a just God.
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:34:37] &gt;&gt; But in most of the animal kingdom, all
[1:34:40] of them have a leader.
[1:34:42] &gt;&gt; So regardless of how much you have an
[1:34:44] instinct, you still need a leader.
[1:34:47] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen.
[1:34:48] &gt;&gt; So God will work with the instinct of
[1:34:51] the leader.
[1:34:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:53] &gt;&gt; Do you follow me?
[1:34:55] &gt;&gt; And then the followers will follow the
[1:34:57] leader to safety.
[1:34:59] &gt;&gt; Because brotherham say some of the duck
[1:35:02] didn't want to follow the leader
[1:35:03] &gt;&gt; and they took their own path and they
[1:35:05] ended up in England
[1:35:07] &gt;&gt; and they didn't know how to come back
[1:35:08] and they all die over there. So it's
[1:35:11] important to follow the leader that is
[1:35:13] following God.
[1:35:15] [Applause]
[1:35:18] Did you get me? It is important to
[1:35:21] follow the leader
[1:35:23] &gt;&gt; that is following God.
[1:35:27] &gt;&gt; Refocus the camera on me. It is
[1:35:29] important to follow the leader that is
[1:35:32] following God.
[1:35:34] &gt;&gt; Because now we know that it's not me,
[1:35:36] it's not him,
[1:35:38] &gt;&gt; but it is over there. That's why Paul
[1:35:40] say follow me
[1:35:42] &gt;&gt; as I follow. Follow brother as he follow
[1:35:50] &gt;&gt; that's why he said I preach like Paul
[1:35:53] [Applause]
[1:35:55] &gt;&gt; we not following the man William Brham
[1:35:58] we are following the Jesus
[1:36:01] &gt;&gt; that brother Brham pointed to us brother
[1:36:05] Brham came to show us Jesus Christ and
[1:36:09] we are following Jesus Christ through
[1:36:12] his messenger That's why we love him.
[1:36:15] &gt;&gt; That's why we adore him. That's why we
[1:36:18] understand that he is God.
[1:36:23] &gt;&gt; Jesus was God in human flesh.
[1:36:26] &gt;&gt; Who told me that? Brother,
[1:36:29] &gt;&gt; we're not worshiping brother. We worship
[1:36:31] Jesus Christ.
[1:36:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:39] &gt;&gt; My two friend in the back, are we clear,
[1:36:41] my friend?
[1:36:42] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Amen.
[1:36:44] &gt;&gt; We clear.
[1:36:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:45] &gt;&gt; That was one angle. Let me refocus the
[1:36:47] angle.
[1:36:48] &gt;&gt; And now we going to take off, my friend.
[1:36:49] We good?
[1:36:50] &gt;&gt; We good?
[1:36:51] &gt;&gt; So, we got God
[1:36:53] &gt;&gt; who's dealing with the leader.
[1:36:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:58] &gt;&gt; He's dealing with the leader and the
[1:37:00] leader are dealing with followers.
[1:37:04] &gt;&gt; So, the chain of command come from God.
[1:37:07] Follow me my friend
[1:37:09] &gt;&gt; to the leader
[1:37:10] &gt;&gt; and the leader to the followers.
[1:37:14] &gt;&gt; If you are with a wrong leader
[1:37:21] &gt;&gt; if you are with a wrong pastor
[1:37:29] &gt;&gt; you answer yourself.
[1:37:31] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:37:32] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:37:34] &gt;&gt; So God the leader and the follower. But
[1:37:37] the end,
[1:37:40] &gt;&gt; do you follow me?
[1:37:40] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:37:41] &gt;&gt; Does have a leader.
[1:37:45] &gt;&gt; Yet the end also have instinct.
[1:37:49] &gt;&gt; And God say, I want you to go to the
[1:37:51] end.
[1:37:52] &gt;&gt; My God.
[1:37:53] &gt;&gt; Jesus.
[1:37:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:55] &gt;&gt; I hope now we together.
[1:37:56] &gt;&gt; God doesn't want you to go
[1:37:59] &gt;&gt; where somebody has a person in between.
[1:38:03] &gt;&gt; Take your time, brother.
[1:38:06] I hope we are together.
[1:38:08] &gt;&gt; In other words, between the followers
[1:38:12] and God, there is a direct line.
[1:38:15] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Yes, sir.
[1:38:17] &gt;&gt; A direct connection
[1:38:19] &gt;&gt; without a leader.
[1:38:22] [Applause]
[1:38:26] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:38:27] &gt;&gt; In other word, in the in the kingdom of
[1:38:30] the earth, God deal with every end.
[1:38:35] individually.
[1:38:36] [Applause]
[1:38:40] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:38:42] Glory to God.
[1:38:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:45] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:38:46] &gt;&gt; How can you brother? I tell brother
[1:38:49] Robert, I say, I don't know how I'm
[1:38:50] going to move with this subject. He
[1:38:52] said, brother Steven, you cannot walk on
[1:38:53] diamond and leave them there.
[1:38:55] &gt;&gt; You You have to continue picking them
[1:38:57] up.
[1:38:58] &gt;&gt; So that's what we doing, my friend.
[1:38:59] Amen. So in this kingdom in the end God
[1:39:04] deal directly
[1:39:06] with the followers.
[1:39:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:11] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:39:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:13] &gt;&gt; Every ant has a direct
[1:39:15] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:39:16] &gt;&gt; connection
[1:39:17] &gt;&gt; with the maker.
[1:39:18] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:39:19] &gt;&gt; Every instinct.
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; Oh glory to God.
[1:39:24] &gt;&gt; is wired
[1:39:26] &gt;&gt; with a Wi-Fi. In other word, in the
[1:39:29] earth kingdom, everybody have a Wi-Fi
[1:39:32] device.
[1:39:34] &gt;&gt; When God is speaking, all the entire
[1:39:36] understanding.
[1:39:37] &gt;&gt; I don't know if you get what I'm saying.
[1:39:40] Who doesn't have a computer here?
[1:39:43] Who doesn't have a computer here?
[1:39:45] &gt;&gt; All of you knows what a computer is.
[1:39:47] &gt;&gt; Your laptop, we used to use a a hook
[1:39:50] that you put on the wall.
[1:39:52] &gt;&gt; Now with your iPad, what do we have?
[1:39:54] Wi-Fi. If you put a password,
[1:39:58] Amen. Once your password enter, you are
[1:40:01] baptized into Christ.
[1:40:03] &gt;&gt; Right. Right. Right. Right. Right.
[1:40:05] Right.
[1:40:07] &gt;&gt; Without password, you don't enter in the
[1:40:09] kingdom.
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; You enter in the kingdom by the
[1:40:12] password, which is the baptism of the
[1:40:14] Holy Ghost. Once you have it, you are
[1:40:16] baptized into Christ. And once you you
[1:40:19] are connect once you get closer if your
[1:40:22] Wi-Fi is connected to this church as
[1:40:25] soon as your car is on the parking lot
[1:40:30] &gt;&gt; the Wi-Fi is connected
[1:40:32] &gt;&gt; in other words whatever happen is moving
[1:40:34] and every earth has a Wi-Fi
[1:40:37] &gt;&gt; connected to the creator
[1:40:40] &gt;&gt; the Wi-Fi device their instinct
[1:40:44] &gt;&gt; do you follow on me is completely
[1:40:46] connected to the maker. In add
[1:40:54] &gt;&gt; a community without leader,
[1:40:57] &gt;&gt; without rulers,
[1:40:59] &gt;&gt; without king,
[1:41:01] &gt;&gt; amen.
[1:41:02] &gt;&gt; I want you to see people who have a
[1:41:05] direct connection
[1:41:07] &gt;&gt; with me.
[1:41:09] &gt;&gt; They don't have a connection with
[1:41:11] somebody in between.
[1:41:13] The connection is directly between God
[1:41:16] &gt;&gt; and the creature.
[1:41:18] &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham says this, glory to
[1:41:21] God.
[1:41:21] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said, "Not for one
[1:41:23] moment.
[1:41:26] &gt;&gt; Not one
[1:41:28] &gt;&gt; do I bring a what?
[1:41:30] &gt;&gt; A message to the people
[1:41:31] &gt;&gt; that they may do what?
[1:41:32] &gt;&gt; Follow me
[1:41:33] &gt;&gt; or what?
[1:41:34] &gt;&gt; Join my church
[1:41:35] &gt;&gt; or what?
[1:41:36] &gt;&gt; Start some fellowship and organization.
[1:41:38] I have never done that
[1:41:41] &gt;&gt; and
[1:41:42] &gt;&gt; will not do that now.
[1:41:43] &gt;&gt; I have only what?
[1:41:44] &gt;&gt; No interest in those things.
[1:41:46] &gt;&gt; But I do have an interest in the things
[1:41:48] of God and what
[1:41:50] &gt;&gt; people.
[1:41:50] &gt;&gt; And if I can accomplish how many things?
[1:41:53] &gt;&gt; Just one thing.
[1:41:54] &gt;&gt; I will be how?
[1:41:55] &gt;&gt; Satisfied.
[1:41:56] &gt;&gt; What is that one thing? That one thing
[1:41:58] is to see establish what?
[1:42:00] &gt;&gt; A true spiritual relationship between
[1:42:03] &gt;&gt; between who?
[1:42:04] &gt;&gt; God and man.
[1:42:05] &gt;&gt; Between God and the earth.
[1:42:08] between God and the earth. What I want
[1:42:11] to accomplish in this church is for you
[1:42:14] to have a relationship with Jesus
[1:42:17] Christ.
[1:42:24] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:42:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:25] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:42:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:26] &gt;&gt; You following the messenger and the
[1:42:29] messenger is taking you to Christ.
[1:42:32] There was a time that Rebecca
[1:42:35] &gt;&gt; have to follow Eli.
[1:42:37] &gt;&gt; But there was a time that Rebecca saw
[1:42:39] Isaac.
[1:42:41] &gt;&gt; Elz must move
[1:42:43] &gt;&gt; and Rebecca must be united with Isaac.
[1:42:47] &gt;&gt; Now the relationship is between Isaac
[1:42:49] and Rebecca. There is a time we were
[1:42:52] going following William Brham, but he
[1:42:55] pointed us to Jesus Christ. Now the time
[1:42:58] has come for you to be connected to
[1:43:00] Jesus.
[1:43:02] [Applause]
[1:43:07] &gt;&gt; Young people look
[1:43:10] [Applause]
[1:43:13] &gt;&gt; young people look your connection to
[1:43:16] Christ not your connection to me to
[1:43:19] Jesus Christ.
[1:43:20] [Applause]
[1:43:25] Because when you are connected to him,
[1:43:27] the Lord is my shepherd.
[1:43:32] &gt;&gt; Not the pastor. The Lord is my shepherd.
[1:43:36] In school, he will guide you. In
[1:43:38] Walmart, he guide you everywhere. He
[1:43:40] will guide you.
[1:43:43] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:43:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:45] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:43:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:46] &gt;&gt; Go to the ant community
[1:43:49] &gt;&gt; and go learn from the ant. What do you
[1:43:51] learn? A people, a community that have a
[1:43:55] direct contact with the maker without
[1:43:59] somebody in between
[1:44:01] &gt;&gt; without a priest in between.
[1:44:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:04] &gt;&gt; In other words, if the priest die, the
[1:44:06] end is fine.
[1:44:08] &gt;&gt; If the pastor leave the message,
[1:44:11] &gt;&gt; I'm fine.
[1:44:14] That's the pastor problem. I was not
[1:44:17] connected to the pastor. I was connected
[1:44:19] to the message and the message is
[1:44:22] Christ.
[1:44:26] &gt;&gt; You leave the message, you go yourself.
[1:44:29] [Applause]
[1:44:33] &gt;&gt; Who brought you to this church?
[1:44:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:44:36] &gt;&gt; Who brought you to this church?
[1:44:38] &gt;&gt; Your parent,
[1:44:39] &gt;&gt; you will leave one day.
[1:44:41] &gt;&gt; Your friend, you will leave one day. But
[1:44:44] if it's Jesus Christ,
[1:44:46] &gt;&gt; you leave that your problem. Me, I'm
[1:44:49] staying because I know who brought me
[1:44:51] here.
[1:44:53] [Applause]
[1:44:55] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus,
[1:44:57] [Applause]
[1:44:59] &gt;&gt; are we together?
[1:45:01] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:45:02] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:45:04] &gt;&gt; Go to the ant. I'm reading the Bible.
[1:45:06] &gt;&gt; We just took off from the airport, but
[1:45:08] I'm still reading the Bible. Go to the
[1:45:10] ant.
[1:45:11] &gt;&gt; Go to the ant. Watch the end.
[1:45:15] &gt;&gt; What is God trying to say?
[1:45:17] &gt;&gt; No ruler. Last Sunday we were on the on
[1:45:20] the surface. Now God is digging us
[1:45:22] deeper. That is not just not having
[1:45:24] control but it also telling you that the
[1:45:27] ant is a community that have a direct
[1:45:31] contact.
[1:45:32] &gt;&gt; The instant the device is connected to
[1:45:35] the Wi-Fi.
[1:45:37] &gt;&gt; The device is not connected to the
[1:45:39] central then to the Wi-Fi. Because if a
[1:45:41] disconnection happen, we got trouble.
[1:45:43] &gt;&gt; My wife is overseas in Africa.
[1:45:46] &gt;&gt; But T-Mobile is working in Africa.
[1:45:48] &gt;&gt; She doesn't need the Wi-Fi over there.
[1:45:50] The Wi-Fi is still working, but T-Mobile
[1:45:53] is here. God might not be closer to you.
[1:45:56] &gt;&gt; But the Wi-Fi is there. And wherever you
[1:45:59] going, he's there. The Wi-Fi is
[1:46:02] connected.
[1:46:04] &gt;&gt; That's why David said, "Don't walk in
[1:46:06] the valley." Still the Wi-Fi is
[1:46:09] connected.
[1:46:12] [Applause]
[1:46:14] Are we together?
[1:46:15] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:46:17] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:46:18] &gt;&gt; Brother, brother, I'm say if I want to
[1:46:19] see one thing to be accomplished, what
[1:46:21] do you want to see? You want to see
[1:46:23] establish what?
[1:46:24] &gt;&gt; A true spiritual relationship
[1:46:26] &gt;&gt; between what?
[1:46:26] &gt;&gt; God and man
[1:46:27] &gt;&gt; wherein men become what?
[1:46:29] &gt;&gt; New creations in Christ.
[1:46:31] &gt;&gt; How?
[1:46:31] &gt;&gt; Filled with his spirit
[1:46:33] &gt;&gt; and live according to what?
[1:46:34] &gt;&gt; His word.
[1:46:35] &gt;&gt; So, brother Brandham want to connect the
[1:46:37] people to Jesus Christ. That's it.
[1:46:40] &gt;&gt; Then you living like an ant.
[1:46:42] &gt;&gt; Then you become wise.
[1:46:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:44] &gt;&gt; In other words,
[1:46:47] &gt;&gt; the wisdom of an ant is coming from God.
[1:46:57] [Applause]
[1:46:58] [Music]
[1:47:01] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:47:02] &gt;&gt; Are we together? The wisdom of an ant
[1:47:06] that wisdom is not an animal wisdom sir.
[1:47:09] &gt;&gt; It is the Holy Ghost.
[1:47:10] &gt;&gt; That's exactly what it is
[1:47:13] &gt;&gt; that is maneuvering with the ant
[1:47:15] &gt;&gt; and the ant is only reflecting because
[1:47:18] God is in nature.
[1:47:20] &gt;&gt; It is not a wisdom of an ant. It is God
[1:47:23] wisdom reflected in the ant.
[1:47:26] &gt;&gt; That's why God is talking to human
[1:47:28] being. Go see my wisdom. how it's
[1:47:32] working in the end.
[1:47:35] [Applause]
[1:47:37] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:47:38] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:47:40] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:47:45] &gt;&gt; Brother Stephen, I don't have wisdom.
[1:47:48] &gt;&gt; You don't have wisdom.
[1:47:50] &gt;&gt; You don't have wisdom. The Bible says
[1:47:52] this, what? If any of you lack what?
[1:47:55] &gt;&gt; Wisdom.
[1:47:56] &gt;&gt; Let him do what?
[1:47:57] &gt;&gt; Ask of God. How?
[1:47:59] &gt;&gt; That giveth to all men liberally.
[1:48:01] &gt;&gt; He give how?
[1:48:02] &gt;&gt; Liberally.
[1:48:03] &gt;&gt; God give how?
[1:48:04] &gt;&gt; Liberally.
[1:48:05] &gt;&gt; Liberally and what?
[1:48:07] &gt;&gt; Breadth not.
[1:48:07] &gt;&gt; And it shall be what?
[1:48:09] &gt;&gt; Given him.
[1:48:09] &gt;&gt; In other words, ask God and it shall be
[1:48:12] what?
[1:48:12] &gt;&gt; Given to you.
[1:48:13] &gt;&gt; And what is that wisdom? The Bible say,
[1:48:15] but unto them which are called both
[1:48:18] what?
[1:48:19] &gt;&gt; Jews.
[1:48:19] &gt;&gt; And Greek Christ the water
[1:48:21] &gt;&gt; power of God.
[1:48:22] &gt;&gt; And the what?
[1:48:23] &gt;&gt; The wisdom of God.
[1:48:24] &gt;&gt; So the wisdom of God is who?
[1:48:26] &gt;&gt; Christ. Any question my friend in
[1:48:29] Corinthian 1:30 this Bible say but of of
[1:48:33] him are ye where
[1:48:34] &gt;&gt; in Christ Jesus
[1:48:35] &gt;&gt; who of God is made unto who
[1:48:38] &gt;&gt; as wisdom
[1:48:39] &gt;&gt; he's made unto as what
[1:48:41] &gt;&gt; wisdom
[1:48:42] &gt;&gt; so who is your wisdom
[1:48:43] &gt;&gt; Christ
[1:48:45] &gt;&gt; you don't have wisdom
[1:48:46] &gt;&gt; because you're not in connection
[1:48:48] &gt;&gt; there is there is
[1:48:50] &gt;&gt; if I don't preach anything that's fine
[1:48:52] &gt;&gt; you don't have wisdom because you're not
[1:48:55] in connection But if you are connected
[1:48:58] then you are connected to the supreme
[1:49:00] wisdom.
[1:49:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the wisdom of God will guide
[1:49:04] you. How can God guard an animal
[1:49:07] &gt;&gt; and doesn't guide you?
[1:49:10] [Applause]
[1:49:13] &gt;&gt; How can God guide an ant
[1:49:17] that you step on
[1:49:19] &gt;&gt; and the ant was not created in the image
[1:49:22] of God?
[1:49:24] But you and me, we were created in the
[1:49:29] &gt;&gt; imagine what?
[1:49:30] &gt;&gt; Like this.
[1:49:31] &gt;&gt; In other words, you were created like
[1:49:32] God.
[1:49:33] &gt;&gt; How can God lead you?
[1:49:36] &gt;&gt; So the problem is not God. The problem
[1:49:38] is us.
[1:49:42] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord.
[1:49:43] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:49:44] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:49:46] &gt;&gt; Young man, listen. Listen. Listen.
[1:49:49] Follow. Follow. Young sister. Seek that
[1:49:51] connection.
[1:49:52] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:49:52] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Are we together?
[1:49:55] &gt;&gt; So to the animal God gave them instinct
[1:49:59] &gt;&gt; and to us God is giving us the spirit
[1:50:02] and God say go to the end and go learn
[1:50:05] something.
[1:50:07] &gt;&gt; They don't have no root. They don't have
[1:50:08] somebody in between. They are in direct
[1:50:11] contact with me. That's why they are
[1:50:14] synchronizing with nature because I am
[1:50:16] in nature.
[1:50:18] &gt;&gt; Brother Brham says this my friend. He
[1:50:20] said God gave an animal what? instinct
[1:50:23] &gt;&gt; to do what?
[1:50:24] &gt;&gt; Take care of himself.
[1:50:25] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:50:27] &gt;&gt; And he gave the man what?
[1:50:28] &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost
[1:50:29] &gt;&gt; to do what?
[1:50:30] &gt;&gt; Take care of him.
[1:50:31] &gt;&gt; But animal believe his instant.
[1:50:35] &gt;&gt; That's it, Lord.
[1:50:37] &gt;&gt; That's it, Lord.
[1:50:40] &gt;&gt; I'm I'm I'm letting that soak. Whoever
[1:50:43] is distracting you,
[1:50:45] &gt;&gt; forget about it.
[1:50:46] &gt;&gt; If it's your person beside you, move
[1:50:49] away from him.
[1:50:50] &gt;&gt; Focus here. Amen.
[1:50:52] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:50:53] &gt;&gt; Because the devil has been fighting
[1:50:55] since we started this service.
[1:50:57] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:50:58] &gt;&gt; Animal believe the instinct.
[1:51:01] &gt;&gt; An animal is believing.
[1:51:04] &gt;&gt; An animal without soul.
[1:51:06] &gt;&gt; When God give him something, the animal
[1:51:08] believe it.
[1:51:12] &gt;&gt; Are we together? He said, but animal
[1:51:15] does what?
[1:51:16] &gt;&gt; Believes his instinct.
[1:51:17] &gt;&gt; And many is scared to trust the Holy
[1:51:20] Ghost. Oh Jesus.
[1:51:24] &gt;&gt; Take your time right there brother.
[1:51:25] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[1:51:27] &gt;&gt; He said man is scared to do what?
[1:51:30] &gt;&gt; Trust the Holy Ghost.
[1:51:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That is what
[1:51:33] &gt;&gt; exactly right.
[1:51:34] &gt;&gt; Our arm and said what we need tonight is
[1:51:38] our arm and say what do you want to say?
[1:51:41] &gt;&gt; Lord God
[1:51:41] &gt;&gt; I believe what
[1:51:43] &gt;&gt; every word you wrote is the truth
[1:51:45] &gt;&gt; and I will stand by it.
[1:51:47] &gt;&gt; Why?
[1:51:47] &gt;&gt; Live or die. It is your holy spirit that
[1:51:50] is doing what?
[1:51:52] &gt;&gt; Then we are going to get somewhere.
[1:51:57] &gt;&gt; You want to get somewhere? Believe the
[1:51:59] holy ghost. Holy
[1:52:00] &gt;&gt; ghost.
[1:52:01] &gt;&gt; Believe the word that has been written.
[1:52:04] &gt;&gt; Believe things that are written in the
[1:52:06] Bible.
[1:52:08] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus.
[1:52:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:10] &gt;&gt; Animal have their belief.
[1:52:13] &gt;&gt; They took you, they give you yours. You
[1:52:15] have a problem believing it. Animal
[1:52:17] don't reason.
[1:52:20] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:52:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:22] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:52:23] &gt;&gt; They believe and they move on.
[1:52:25] &gt;&gt; You won't see a bird standing there and
[1:52:28] say,
[1:52:28] &gt;&gt; "Am I going to fly or not?"
[1:52:33] &gt;&gt; The bird just take off.
[1:52:37] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:52:38] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:52:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:43] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Brother Brandham said
[1:52:45] the trouble of it is with men. He don't
[1:52:48] know his leader.
[1:52:54] &gt;&gt; Yes sir. They shall do what?
[1:52:56] &gt;&gt; Rally around the denomination.
[1:52:58] &gt;&gt; They shall rally around what?
[1:53:00] &gt;&gt; A bishop
[1:53:00] &gt;&gt; or what?
[1:53:01] &gt;&gt; A man.
[1:53:02] &gt;&gt; But they don't want to rally around who?
[1:53:04] &gt;&gt; The leader.
[1:53:05] &gt;&gt; Who's the leader?
[1:53:06] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit.
[1:53:08] &gt;&gt; Where?
[1:53:08] &gt;&gt; In the word.
[1:53:09] &gt;&gt; Holy power.
[1:53:11] &gt;&gt; That's powerful.
[1:53:11] &gt;&gt; The leader is what? The Holy Spirit.
[1:53:14] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit where
[1:53:15] &gt;&gt; is the word.
[1:53:16] &gt;&gt; So the anointed word.
[1:53:20] &gt;&gt; The anointed word
[1:53:22] &gt;&gt; is your leader.
[1:53:25] [Applause]
[1:53:27] &gt;&gt; Jesus.
[1:53:29] &gt;&gt; Some of you are quiet. I don't know
[1:53:31] what's wrong with you.
[1:53:33] The Bible says,
[1:53:35] &gt;&gt; the Bible say the leather killers.
[1:53:41] [Applause]
[1:53:42] &gt;&gt; Everybody's reading this
[1:53:44] &gt;&gt; but they don't know. But when the spirit
[1:53:47] come
[1:53:48] &gt;&gt; and anoint the word and begin to move
[1:53:51] on,
[1:53:52] &gt;&gt; that is the direction, the anointed word
[1:53:55] of the hour.
[1:53:57] [Applause]
[1:54:02] message believer.
[1:54:04] &gt;&gt; What is leading you?
[1:54:07] &gt;&gt; What is leading you?
[1:54:09] &gt;&gt; What is leading message believer?
[1:54:13] &gt;&gt; You got a court,
[1:54:14] &gt;&gt; but do you have the spirit of the court?
[1:54:20] &gt;&gt; The spirit that will quicken the court
[1:54:23] &gt;&gt; and make the court alive.
[1:54:26] &gt;&gt; Now he become a fresh word.
[1:54:29] Glory, glory, glory, Lord.
[1:54:35] Amen.
[1:54:36] &gt;&gt; It's amazing
[1:54:37] &gt;&gt; the choices people are doing.
[1:54:39] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:54:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's amazing the choices people
[1:54:43] are doing.
[1:54:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:54:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Who is your leader?
[1:54:47] &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about me.
[1:54:49] &gt;&gt; Because even myself, I'm mandated
[1:54:51] leader.
[1:54:52] &gt;&gt; And that leader must be the anointed
[1:54:54] one.
[1:54:55] In other words, when we come here, we
[1:54:57] don't want to hear from men.
[1:54:59] &gt;&gt; We are hearing from God.
[1:55:05] &gt;&gt; A God that can speak through my pastor.
[1:55:09] &gt;&gt; And I will say the pastor don't know
[1:55:12] anything about this.
[1:55:15] &gt;&gt; This is something that myself know.
[1:55:17] &gt;&gt; This happened. This is a conversation I
[1:55:20] was having with my wife, with my
[1:55:22] brother. The pastor was not there. How
[1:55:25] did the pastor know? It is not the
[1:55:28] pastor. It is the anointed word.
[1:55:33] [Music]
[1:55:35] &gt;&gt; When the anointed word is coming,
[1:55:37] &gt;&gt; it is God.
[1:55:40] &gt;&gt; That's exactly what
[1:55:42] &gt;&gt; I am only a vessel.
[1:55:46] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[1:55:47] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:55:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:48] &gt;&gt; A pastor is an officer.
[1:55:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:54] Amen.
[1:55:54] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:55:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:56] &gt;&gt; How can I say something this morning
[1:55:58] that you know I was not yesterday with
[1:56:00] you
[1:56:02] &gt;&gt; and then you sit around you say well
[1:56:04] where where well where well where well
[1:56:05] where well where well where well where
[1:56:05] well where well where well where well
[1:56:05] where well where well where well where
[1:56:05] well where well where well where well
[1:56:05] where well where well where well where
[1:56:05] it's not well the leader is talking to
[1:56:08] you
[1:56:09] [Applause]
[1:56:13] if you know something that I was not
[1:56:15] there.
[1:56:16] &gt;&gt; So this sermon belong to me so I need to
[1:56:19] pay more attention. What else does God
[1:56:22] want me to heal today for my life?
[1:56:26] [Music]
[1:56:29] &gt;&gt; Because God is already talking.
[1:56:37] &gt;&gt; You get to church and you are distracted
[1:56:39] and things happen. Hey my friend,
[1:56:46] &gt;&gt; let me let me ask you something. If you
[1:56:49] die today
[1:56:50] &gt;&gt; and we bury you,
[1:56:52] &gt;&gt; who's going to take care of your bank
[1:56:54] account?
[1:56:57] &gt;&gt; Will will your family be buried with
[1:56:58] you?
[1:56:59] &gt;&gt; No. They will leave you. And matter of
[1:57:01] fact, if they keep you too too long, you
[1:57:03] begin to stink.
[1:57:05] &gt;&gt; So, we don't want you anymore.
[1:57:06] &gt;&gt; In a in a in a in a clean way, we put
[1:57:09] you in a good casket to take care of you
[1:57:12] quickly. In other words,
[1:57:14] &gt;&gt; if you die, the world will continue to
[1:57:17] go. So when you get to church, whichever
[1:57:20] emergencies, turn yourself on off.
[1:57:24] &gt;&gt; They will find solution. I need to
[1:57:26] listen to my maker.
[1:57:32] [Applause]
[1:57:35] &gt;&gt; Sometime we are acting up like if we are
[1:57:39] not there people will die. No.
[1:57:43] &gt;&gt; You must know how to turn yourself on
[1:57:45] asleep.
[1:57:47] Whatever happened in the night, call the
[1:57:49] police.
[1:57:51] &gt;&gt; I cannot be standing 24 hours waiting
[1:57:54] for problem to solve.
[1:57:55] &gt;&gt; No sir.
[1:57:57] &gt;&gt; If you die when we go to the rapture,
[1:57:59] the world will continue for three and a
[1:58:01] half years.
[1:58:02] &gt;&gt; You won't be there.
[1:58:04] &gt;&gt; So run out. Leave everything away. Focus
[1:58:07] to your maker.
[1:58:12] [Applause]
[1:58:16] Are we together?
[1:58:17] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham say the leader is who?
[1:58:20] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit.
[1:58:21] &gt;&gt; Their
[1:58:22] &gt;&gt; the Holy Spirit where
[1:58:24] &gt;&gt; in the word.
[1:58:25] &gt;&gt; See, they say, "Oh, well, I'm afraid I
[1:58:28] shall get a little water
[1:58:29] &gt;&gt; fanatically.
[1:58:30] &gt;&gt; I'm afraid I shall get off on the
[1:58:32] water."
[1:58:32] &gt;&gt; Wrong foot.
[1:58:33] &gt;&gt; People in this message are even a scare
[1:58:35] of the action of the Holy Spirit.
[1:58:38] &gt;&gt; Let me even put it clearly. They are
[1:58:40] ashamed.
[1:58:44] They want to be civilized.
[1:58:45] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:58:46] &gt;&gt; No sir
[1:58:47] &gt;&gt; with the Holy Spirit.
[1:58:49] &gt;&gt; You have not met one yet.
[1:58:53] &gt;&gt; You have not met the real one yet.
[1:58:56] &gt;&gt; When he will hit you like an
[1:58:58] electricity.
[1:58:59] &gt;&gt; I will see how civilized you going to
[1:59:01] be.
[1:59:03] [Applause]
[1:59:08] If your church don't have one, come and
[1:59:10] test this one.
[1:59:14] [Applause]
[1:59:16] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Yeah. I'm going to get
[1:59:18] beside myself.
[1:59:20] &gt;&gt; When I get beside the king, that's it.
[1:59:22] It won't be a surprise. I'm already
[1:59:25] getting beside here as a training. So
[1:59:28] when I get there, it's a habit.
[1:59:34] In other words, I won't be surprised.
[1:59:38] &gt;&gt; You the one who will be surprised is the
[1:59:40] one that were like this in church. You
[1:59:43] will be surprised in heaven.
[1:59:44] &gt;&gt; Brother said there are noises over there
[1:59:47] and in hell also there are noises.
[1:59:53] &gt;&gt; So I don't know where you want to go.
[1:59:56] [Applause]
[1:59:57] &gt;&gt; As for me and my house, we going to
[1:59:59] heaven. But we live in heaven already
[2:00:02] here.

[2:00:07] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:00:08] &gt;&gt; Brother, brother, say, "Oh, there you
[2:00:11] are."
[2:00:12] &gt;&gt; What if the little duck say,
[2:00:14] &gt;&gt; "I just don't like the way he keep his
[2:00:16] feathers.
[2:00:17] &gt;&gt; I don't believe I shall follow him." You
[2:00:20] shall freeze to what?
[2:00:23] &gt;&gt; I don't like the way he preaches.
[2:00:26] &gt;&gt; I don't like his English.
[2:00:28] You are you will freeze to death.
[2:00:31] &gt;&gt; It's not a matter of preference. It's a
[2:00:34] matter of life.
[2:00:39] [Applause]
[2:00:42] &gt;&gt; If God choose a short man, sub it.
[2:00:45] &gt;&gt; A torment sub it. A heavy set it.
[2:00:50] &gt;&gt; What I'm looking for is what is God
[2:00:52] telling me?
[2:00:56] when I get what God want me to hear. God
[2:00:59] bless you, brother. See you next Sunday.
[2:01:02] &gt;&gt; I was looking for my message. In other
[2:01:04] words, you are like a postman office.
[2:01:08] &gt;&gt; He's just delivering the mail.
[2:01:11] &gt;&gt; You don't build relationship.
[2:01:13] &gt;&gt; Get a mail and get me my mail and see
[2:01:16] you again for the next mail.
[2:01:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I don't like the post office
[2:01:25] men that come here.
[2:01:32] &gt;&gt; So you won't receive the mail at home
[2:01:38] &gt;&gt; when it's post office. You don't make
[2:01:40] preference.
[2:01:42] &gt;&gt; When it's the bank, you don't make
[2:01:43] preference.
[2:01:44] &gt;&gt; When it's McDonald, you don't make
[2:01:46] preference. When it's the church,
[2:01:49] &gt;&gt; then you begin to draw a list.
[2:01:51] &gt;&gt; Check. Check. Check. Check.
[2:01:56] [Applause]
[2:01:57] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:01:59] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:02:00] &gt;&gt; Go to the earth
[2:02:02] &gt;&gt; and learn a kingdom
[2:02:04] &gt;&gt; that are in direct contact with the
[2:02:06] maker.
[2:02:10] &gt;&gt; I have not started preaching. I'm on the
[2:02:12] first uh scripture.
[2:02:14] &gt;&gt; Can you swallow something?
[2:02:16] &gt;&gt; You'll be able to handle it.
[2:02:18] &gt;&gt; You won't get mad on me. Anyway, even if
[2:02:21] you get mad on me, I will deliver it.
[2:02:24] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:02:25] &gt;&gt; You think you can swallow this?
[2:02:27] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:02:28] &gt;&gt; You promise?
[2:02:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:29] &gt;&gt; Brother Devon, you promise. Ah, brother
[2:02:32] Devon, say yes. Brother Bradam says
[2:02:35] this. He says there is something about
[2:02:38] women.
[2:02:41] &gt;&gt; I told you, you say you going to, but
[2:02:43] we're going to get it.
[2:02:45] &gt;&gt; I told you you say you're going to get
[2:02:46] it. So, we want to skip. Ah. So let him
[2:02:50] move it.
[2:02:53] You want to hear it?
[2:02:59] &gt;&gt; This stage is something.
[2:03:02] &gt;&gt; Okay. Okay. So that's your problem.
[2:03:05] Brother Brandham said there is something
[2:03:07] about who
[2:03:08] &gt;&gt; woman
[2:03:09] &gt;&gt; that is a little different than what?
[2:03:11] &gt;&gt; Usually she's got a high instinct.
[2:03:15] [Applause]
[2:03:24] I was trying to hide this code but I
[2:03:26] can't
[2:03:34] &gt;&gt; I hope we don't have legalistic here
[2:03:36] because they will pass out and they need
[2:03:38] to be CPR right now.
[2:03:42] There is something about what
[2:03:43] &gt;&gt; woman
[2:03:44] &gt;&gt; that she has a what?
[2:03:45] &gt;&gt; A high instinct.
[2:03:48] &gt;&gt; That's why be careful with mama
[2:03:51] &gt;&gt; when she's saying something.
[2:03:56] &gt;&gt; Mama can look at a girl and say, "My
[2:03:58] boy, not this one."
[2:04:01] [Applause]
[2:04:04] &gt;&gt; Mama can look at a man and say, "Hey
[2:04:06] honey, this your your friend there. I
[2:04:09] just don't like him." Well, well,
[2:04:12] because there is a mistake.
[2:04:15] [Music]
[2:04:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:22] [Applause]
[2:04:27] &gt;&gt; And usually men are rational. Well,
[2:04:29] well, I don't see any problem with him.
[2:04:31] &gt;&gt; He say, you know what? You do whatever
[2:04:33] you want to do, but I I just I won't be
[2:04:36] part of it.
[2:04:39] So honey, you don't want to support me.
[2:04:41] When it's your turn, I support you. You
[2:04:43] don't want to support me on your part.
[2:04:44] Uh you don't understand what it is.
[2:04:46] There is something in a woman.
[2:04:48] &gt;&gt; William Maron Brown
[2:04:50] &gt;&gt; that is a what?
[2:04:51] &gt;&gt; Instinct.
[2:04:51] &gt;&gt; In other words, man hasn't instinct.
[2:04:55] &gt;&gt; Women have instinct. But women instinct
[2:04:58] are what?
[2:04:58] &gt;&gt; Higher
[2:04:59] &gt;&gt; than a what?

[2:05:05] use it for who?
[2:05:06] &gt;&gt; God. and she get her point and do what?
[2:05:10] &gt;&gt; Stays with it.
[2:05:13] &gt;&gt; In other words, sister,
[2:05:15] &gt;&gt; take your instinct.
[2:05:17] &gt;&gt; God already built you.
[2:05:21] [Applause]

[2:15:58] &gt;&gt; Which have no guide
[2:15:59] &gt;&gt; overseer or what?
[2:16:01] &gt;&gt; Ruler.
[2:16:04] &gt;&gt; Brother Glenn.
[2:16:06] &gt;&gt; I have 20 minutes left. I have not
[2:16:08] finished my scripture yet. So, let me
[2:16:10] try. Okay.
[2:16:12] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[2:16:13] [Laughter]
[2:16:15] &gt;&gt; Let's go to verse uh uh 8. provide what
[2:16:20] &gt;&gt; her meat
[2:16:21] &gt;&gt; when
[2:16:21] &gt;&gt; in the summer
[2:16:23] &gt;&gt; and gatherth her food when
[2:16:25] &gt;&gt; in the harvest.
[2:16:28] &gt;&gt; We went through this.
[2:16:30] &gt;&gt; So summer.
[2:16:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:36] &gt;&gt; And harvest. What is the season of
[2:16:38] harvest to us?
[2:16:39] &gt;&gt; Fall.
[2:16:40] &gt;&gt; Fall. Summer and autumn.
[2:16:44] All fall is a preparation time.
[2:16:49] Thank you Lord.
[2:16:51] &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord.
[2:16:52] &gt;&gt; Amen
[2:16:53] &gt;&gt; for ant.
[2:16:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:55] &gt;&gt; In other word the wisdom of an ant
[2:16:59] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:17:00] &gt;&gt; is reflected by her ability
[2:17:04] &gt;&gt; to synchronize with the season.
[2:17:08] &gt;&gt; That's it. Amen. God enter the end and
[2:17:13] give the end wisdom and that wisdom is
[2:17:17] able to catch the season.
[2:17:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:21] &gt;&gt; So wisdom
[2:17:23] &gt;&gt; is described by the ability
[2:17:27] to connect to identify
[2:17:33] &gt;&gt; to act
[2:17:36] &gt;&gt; according to the season.
[2:17:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Correct.
[2:17:41] &gt;&gt; Wisdom, I'm going to get somewhere.
[2:17:44] &gt;&gt; Is described by the ability to discern.
[2:17:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:50] &gt;&gt; To recognize.
[2:17:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. And to act upon the season.
[2:17:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:59] &gt;&gt; Because our subject is taking advantage
[2:18:02] &gt;&gt; of the season.
[2:18:04] &gt;&gt; Are we together? So when everybody's at
[2:18:07] the beach
[2:18:10] &gt;&gt; because it's summer,
[2:18:12] &gt;&gt; when everybody's on the mall,
[2:18:15] &gt;&gt; on the fer wheel.
[2:18:16] &gt;&gt; Uh-huh.
[2:18:18] &gt;&gt; The ant has a different GPS.
[2:18:21] &gt;&gt; Uh-huh.
[2:18:21] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen.
[2:18:22] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:18:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:26] &gt;&gt; The GPS is which season am I in?
[2:18:28] &gt;&gt; Correct. Amen.
[2:18:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:30] &gt;&gt; That's right, brother.
[2:18:30] &gt;&gt; Summer. Summer means what?
[2:18:32] &gt;&gt; Preparation.
[2:18:33] &gt;&gt; Preparation. Why? Because there is a
[2:18:35] harvest
[2:18:36] &gt;&gt; that have start fall a harvest.
[2:18:38] &gt;&gt; So the ant is preparing for what? What
[2:18:42] did we see? The ant was preparing for
[2:18:44] what? He's in summer and autumn. He's
[2:18:47] preparing for which season?
[2:18:49] &gt;&gt; Uh winter.
[2:18:50] &gt;&gt; For winter.
[2:18:53] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:18:53] &gt;&gt; Is summer winter?
[2:18:55] &gt;&gt; No.
[2:18:56] &gt;&gt; Is autumn winter?
[2:18:57] &gt;&gt; No.
[2:18:58] &gt;&gt; So the ant is one season ahead.
[2:19:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right.
[2:19:04] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:19:07] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:19:09] &gt;&gt; You didn't get me well, my friend.
[2:19:11] &gt;&gt; When you are in the fall, the eyes of an
[2:19:14] ant is in winter.
[2:19:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:17] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:19:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:19] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:19:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:20] &gt;&gt; So, the behavior of a
[2:19:24] &gt;&gt; of an ant
[2:19:26] &gt;&gt; is based on the vision of the future.
[2:19:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:31] &gt;&gt; There he is. Amen. Amen.
[2:19:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:35] &gt;&gt; I I I I pray God I can get there.
[2:19:40] &gt;&gt; Let me explain it this way. If I can get
[2:19:43] it.
[2:19:45] When we are in the summer
[2:19:48] &gt;&gt; and in the fall, the earth is looking
[2:19:50] for what?
[2:19:51] &gt;&gt; Winter.
[2:19:53] &gt;&gt; Let me hold on. If I can get to that
[2:19:56] hopefully then I will explain that what
[2:19:58] it is. But just keep in mind the ant is
[2:20:01] one month ahead.
[2:20:04] &gt;&gt; So the life the ant is living on the
[2:20:07] summer
[2:20:07] &gt;&gt; is not for summer.
[2:20:09] &gt;&gt; No correct my brother.
[2:20:12] &gt;&gt; That's correct brother.
[2:20:14] &gt;&gt; In other words young I have quote I wish
[2:20:17] I have even four hours to sit with you.
[2:20:18] I have quotes that I will show you that
[2:20:21] the time you are right now single.
[2:20:23] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[2:20:24] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. Whatever you doing,
[2:20:27] &gt;&gt; Angel, whatever you doing right now,
[2:20:29] &gt;&gt; as a single,
[2:20:31] &gt;&gt; you will reap the consequences.
[2:20:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:35] &gt;&gt; Down the road.
[2:20:37] &gt;&gt; Because I'm trying to show you what do
[2:20:39] you do in season.
[2:20:40] &gt;&gt; Uh-huh.
[2:20:41] &gt;&gt; If I have to take five, six, seven, 10
[2:20:43] sermon, I don't have any problem.
[2:20:45] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:20:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:46] &gt;&gt; So, if you don't behave,
[2:20:52] &gt;&gt; do you see your parent?
[2:20:53] &gt;&gt; Amen. You see, as parent and as pastor,
[2:20:57] I can predict your trouble in marriage.
[2:21:01] &gt;&gt; Based on what you're doing right now
[2:21:04] &gt;&gt; based on what you're doing right now,
[2:21:06] &gt;&gt; I can just look at you and if I if you
[2:21:08] if you love me, you give me chances and
[2:21:11] you give me permission. I can talk to
[2:21:13] your husband about the trouble he's
[2:21:15] going to have.
[2:21:16] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[2:21:17] &gt;&gt; I would tell him you're going to marry.
[2:21:18] She's a wonderful sister, wonderful
[2:21:20] young man. But just know that when you
[2:21:22] get in marriage, work on this. Work on
[2:21:24] this and this and this. You're going to
[2:21:26] have trouble in this
[2:21:27] &gt;&gt; area.
[2:21:32] &gt;&gt; Based on what you're doing right now.
[2:21:35] &gt;&gt; The way you maneuvering,
[2:21:37] &gt;&gt; the way you moving,
[2:21:39] &gt;&gt; the way you acting, it's already
[2:21:41] prepared. I have quote.
[2:21:43] &gt;&gt; I wish I have time. Lord help me.
[2:21:47] Because I I I'm going to go with this
[2:21:49] slowly because our young people must be
[2:21:52] free.
[2:21:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:57] &gt;&gt; I'm going to say something that's going
[2:21:59] to be too strong,
[2:22:00] &gt;&gt; but you will understand me one day.
[2:22:04] &gt;&gt; The ant. Who's working in the end?
[2:22:06] &gt;&gt; I mean, who's working on the summer?
[2:22:08] &gt;&gt; The ant.
[2:22:09] &gt;&gt; Because this just came down, brother
[2:22:10] Clay, and I have to deliver it.
[2:22:12] &gt;&gt; Who's working in autumn?
[2:22:14] &gt;&gt; The ant. He's working for who?
[2:22:17] &gt;&gt; The winter.
[2:22:18] &gt;&gt; He's working for who?
[2:22:22] &gt;&gt; For the company.
[2:22:23] &gt;&gt; No.
[2:22:23] &gt;&gt; He's working for who?
[2:22:24] &gt;&gt; Himself.
[2:22:25] &gt;&gt; For himself to live where?
[2:22:27] &gt;&gt; In the winter.
[2:22:28] &gt;&gt; So who's manufacturing his own future?
[2:22:31] &gt;&gt; The answer is.
[2:22:33] &gt;&gt; So who's preparing his own future?
[2:22:37] &gt;&gt; So who should prepare your future?
[2:22:42] I don't know if you getting me.
[2:22:45] [Applause]
[2:22:48] &gt;&gt; Father, help your children.
[2:22:51] &gt;&gt; Who should prepare your Not my future?
[2:22:54] &gt;&gt; I'm already here.
[2:22:56] &gt;&gt; Who should prepare your future?
[2:22:58] &gt;&gt; You.
[2:23:01] &gt;&gt; Brother Lam, who should prepare your
[2:23:02] future?
[2:23:04] &gt;&gt; So if your future flacks,
[2:23:12] If your
[2:23:13] &gt;&gt; I believe it.
[2:23:16] &gt;&gt; If your marriage is in trouble,
[2:23:18] &gt;&gt; let's watch the preparation.
[2:23:20] &gt;&gt; Let's go back to the preparation.
[2:23:23] [Applause]
[2:23:24] &gt;&gt; If your company is in trouble, if your
[2:23:27] school is in problem,
[2:23:29] &gt;&gt; brother Lord go, let me I need to go see
[2:23:31] your preparation.
[2:23:33] &gt;&gt; And he admitted he was on the wrong
[2:23:35] crowd. Yes.
[2:23:36] &gt;&gt; So, he didn't prepare for the right.
[2:23:38] That's why he got in trouble.
[2:23:40] &gt;&gt; But now I pray God that this is your
[2:23:43] last lesson
[2:23:45] &gt;&gt; from now on. A's and B's.
[2:23:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:23:50] A's and B's.
[2:23:54] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:23:56] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:23:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:23:57] &gt;&gt; Your future is right here in your hand.
[2:24:00] &gt;&gt; In other words, the creator is bringing
[2:24:02] that to you.
[2:24:03] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:24:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:24:04] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen.
[2:24:06] &gt;&gt; Instead of building it
[2:24:09] &gt;&gt; with your own hands,
[2:24:10] &gt;&gt; you are plugging that down.
[2:24:13] &gt;&gt; And tomorrow you blame mommy.
[2:24:16] &gt;&gt; You blame daddy.
[2:24:18] &gt;&gt; I know you won't blame me.
[2:24:20] &gt;&gt; Because I took time question and answer
[2:24:22] young man meeting young. So you have no
[2:24:24] blame on me. I am completely innocent.
[2:24:28] &gt;&gt; I have tape and quote and everything. If
[2:24:30] you miss meeting that was not my
[2:24:31] problem. I told you three months ahead,
[2:24:33] four month ahead, everything. That was
[2:24:35] your own problem.
[2:24:37] &gt;&gt; So me, your blood is not in my I'm going
[2:24:39] to heaven singing.
[2:24:43] [Music]
[2:24:45] &gt;&gt; Whatever you do now, you are cooking
[2:24:47] your future.
[2:24:50] [Applause]
[2:24:52] &gt;&gt; Whatever you do with money now, you are
[2:24:54] cooking your future.
[2:24:59] [Applause]
[2:25:01] Where are we at, my friend?
[2:25:04] &gt;&gt; Verse eight.
[2:25:05] &gt;&gt; Ah, verse eight. Provide her meat when
[2:25:07] &gt;&gt; in the summer
[2:25:08] &gt;&gt; and gather her food when
[2:25:09] &gt;&gt; in the harvest.
[2:25:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25:11] &gt;&gt; We finished the first uh reading. Let's
[2:25:13] go to the second reading. Proverb 10
[2:25:15] verse 5.
[2:25:17] &gt;&gt; Second scripture.
[2:25:21] &gt;&gt; Then when I finish, you give me 45
[2:25:24] minutes to stop preaching.
[2:25:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25:26] &gt;&gt; Some of you will get heart attack.
[2:25:33] Thank God it won't happen in church.
[2:25:35] Amen.
[2:25:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:25:38] &gt;&gt; Proverb 10, what? Verse 5.
[2:25:41] &gt;&gt; He that gatherth when
[2:25:44] &gt;&gt; in summer.
[2:25:44] &gt;&gt; Do you see what happened?
[2:25:46] &gt;&gt; Now it's not the end. God is going back
[2:25:48] to human being. Now
[2:25:49] &gt;&gt; he that gatherereth when
[2:25:51] &gt;&gt; in summer
[2:25:51] &gt;&gt; is a what?
[2:25:52] &gt;&gt; Wise son.
[2:25:53] &gt;&gt; So the wisdom of that son is determined
[2:25:56] by what? the gathering when in season.
[2:26:02] &gt;&gt; So wisdom what I'm trying to show you
[2:26:04] see wisdom is depend is defined by the
[2:26:08] action in season.
[2:26:10] &gt;&gt; If the son begin to gather within summer
[2:26:14] the bible say he's a wise son
[2:26:17] &gt;&gt; because he's a son that now it's
[2:26:18] synchronizing with God's program.
[2:26:21] &gt;&gt; God program harvest start on summer. The
[2:26:24] ant are working. You need to be working
[2:26:26] too. Amen.
[2:26:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:26:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:26:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:26:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:26:32] &gt;&gt; I have a question because some of you
[2:26:34] are like carpet people.
[2:26:37] &gt;&gt; Do you know carpet? The people that live
[2:26:40] for the present time.
[2:26:43] &gt;&gt; So they don't care about tomorrow.
[2:26:46] &gt;&gt; You give me you give him the money, they
[2:26:48] burn it today. They say tomorrow you'll
[2:26:50] be okay.
[2:26:51] &gt;&gt; Hey, let me live. Tomorrow I may die. So
[2:26:53] let me just burn it today. Amen.
[2:26:56] &gt;&gt; It's in Latin if I'm not mistaken.
[2:26:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:26:59] &gt;&gt; The ant work in the summer in the fall.
[2:27:01] Do you think the ant work in winter?
[2:27:03] &gt;&gt; No.
[2:27:04] &gt;&gt; No.
[2:27:06] &gt;&gt; So why don't you wait for the winter
[2:27:07] break?
[2:27:09] &gt;&gt; You are taking break in the summer.
[2:27:15] &gt;&gt; Then in the winter it will not be the
[2:27:17] season of a harvest
[2:27:19] &gt;&gt; and you have to work now harder
[2:27:21] &gt;&gt; because you are working against the
[2:27:23] season. Amen.
[2:27:25] &gt;&gt; You pray your prayer are not answer
[2:27:27] because you are of the season.
[2:27:32] &gt;&gt; Wait my friend,
[2:27:33] &gt;&gt; I'm just at the surface of this. I have
[2:27:36] not dumped to yet.
[2:27:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:27:38] &gt;&gt; And then you find out you are praying,
[2:27:39] you are praying, nothing is working.
[2:27:40] Nothing is working because check what
[2:27:43] you miss.
[2:27:44] &gt;&gt; That's exactly right.
[2:27:45] &gt;&gt; When God was knocking at the door
[2:27:47] because the scripture say today
[2:27:50] &gt;&gt; if you hear his voice, harden not your
[2:27:52] heart. Because today means tomorrow they
[2:27:55] can close that.
[2:27:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:28:02] &gt;&gt; Father, help me up.
[2:28:04] &gt;&gt; He say he, let's go, my friend. He that
[2:28:07] does what
[2:28:08] &gt;&gt; gatherth in summer
[2:28:09] &gt;&gt; is a water.
[2:28:09] &gt;&gt; A wise son.
[2:28:10] &gt;&gt; But he that do what
[2:28:12] &gt;&gt; sleepeth in harvest
[2:28:13] &gt;&gt; is a water
[2:28:14] &gt;&gt; is a son that causth shame.
[2:28:15] &gt;&gt; So in the harvest, what is this other
[2:28:17] son doing?
[2:28:18] &gt;&gt; Sleeping.
[2:28:21] So when you sleeping, somebody's
[2:28:23] working.
[2:28:24] &gt;&gt; So there is two people in the same
[2:28:26] season.
[2:28:27] &gt;&gt; One is wise by the way of working and
[2:28:31] one is foolish
[2:28:33] &gt;&gt; by the way of his behaving based on the
[2:28:35] season.
[2:28:36] &gt;&gt; So when I see you
[2:28:38] &gt;&gt; correct
[2:28:38] &gt;&gt; and I look at the season
[2:28:41] &gt;&gt; and I watch your behavioral,
[2:28:44] &gt;&gt; I already know the trouble that is
[2:28:46] coming ahead. Amen.
[2:28:48] &gt;&gt; And I'm warning you and you think I'm
[2:28:50] tight. I'm too strong. I don't want you
[2:28:52] to have fun.
[2:28:54] &gt;&gt; I'm already I'm always controlling.
[2:28:56] Where are you? What are you doing? What
[2:28:57] are you What are you What I'm just
[2:29:00] protecting you
[2:29:01] &gt;&gt; to utilize and maximize your season now
[2:29:06] to prepare your future.
[2:29:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:29:12] &gt;&gt; Because there will come a time I won't
[2:29:14] call you.
[2:29:17] Amen.
[2:29:17] &gt;&gt; You grown up.
[2:29:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:29:21] &gt;&gt; And at that time you will be looking for
[2:29:22] my phone call.
[2:29:24] [Laughter]
[2:29:26] &gt;&gt; That was the second scripture. Let's go
[2:29:28] to the third scripture. Proverb 30.
[2:29:31] &gt;&gt; Now you start doing good when we ending
[2:29:33] toward the end.
[2:29:37] Proverb 30.
[2:29:39] uh sister, we might have to change
[2:29:41] taking advantage and push it next week
[2:29:43] because we might have to find another
[2:29:45] subject.
[2:29:49] &gt;&gt; If you dare, you can say amen.
[2:29:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:29:53] &gt;&gt; Lord have mercy. Proverb 30:24
[2:29:58] there be what?
[2:29:59] &gt;&gt; Four things
[2:30:00] &gt;&gt; which are how
[2:30:01] &gt;&gt; little upon the earth.
[2:30:02] &gt;&gt; Very little. But how?
[2:30:03] &gt;&gt; They are exceeding wise.
[2:30:05] &gt;&gt; Do you see what I'm saying?
[2:30:07] The ant are a people what?
[2:30:09] &gt;&gt; Not strong.
[2:30:10] &gt;&gt; So it doesn't mean it doesn't depend on
[2:30:12] a physical strength.
[2:30:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:30:16] &gt;&gt; Not strong yet they prepare the what?
[2:30:20] &gt;&gt; Their meat
[2:30:20] &gt;&gt; in the water.
[2:30:21] &gt;&gt; The summer.
[2:30:22] &gt;&gt; If you notice they are very little,
[2:30:25] &gt;&gt; not strength but
[2:30:28] &gt;&gt; exceedingly wise.
[2:30:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:30:31] &gt;&gt; The little thing but they are making big
[2:30:33] accomplishment. A small David
[2:30:38] &gt;&gt; is the one to bring Goliath down.
[2:30:42] &gt;&gt; Not a big Saul. A small David
[2:30:44] &gt;&gt; because David was connected
[2:30:46] &gt;&gt; to the maker.
[2:30:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:30:49] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:30:49] &gt;&gt; And because he was connected to the
[2:30:51] maker, he can bring Goliath down. When
[2:30:53] everybody that was there, nobody could
[2:30:55] touch Goliath.
[2:30:57] &gt;&gt; We clear?
[2:30:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:30:58] &gt;&gt; We clear?
[2:30:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:30:59] &gt;&gt; Let's go to Matthew 24.
[2:31:03] Ah, praise God. Finally, we moving.
[2:31:08] &gt;&gt; Let's go to Matthew 24.
[2:31:10] &gt;&gt; Don't worry, my friend.
[2:31:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:31:12] &gt;&gt; I'm going to finish
[2:31:13] &gt;&gt; for those and your prayer will be
[2:31:15] answered.
[2:31:19] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:31:21] &gt;&gt; And watch how long you going to stay in
[2:31:23] a restaurant.
[2:31:27] &gt;&gt; If you there, you can say amen.
[2:31:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:31:29] until the waitress told you, "Look at
[2:31:31] you like you need to leave."
[2:31:35] &gt;&gt; You there?
[2:31:36] &gt;&gt; You there?
[2:31:38] &gt;&gt; Are we there?
[2:31:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:31:41] &gt;&gt; Uh Matthew 24. If you there, you can say
[2:31:44] amen.
[2:31:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:31:45] &gt;&gt; Verse 45, the Bible say, "Who then is a
[2:31:50] faithful and a what?"
[2:31:51] &gt;&gt; "And wise servant."
[2:31:54] &gt;&gt; A faithful and a wise servant. Brother
[2:31:56] Robert.
[2:31:57] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. whom his lord has made ruler
[2:32:01] over what
[2:32:02] &gt;&gt; his household. So brother Tony
[2:32:05] &gt;&gt; to be a ruler in God's household there
[2:32:09] are qualification.
[2:32:11] &gt;&gt; God require you to be faithful
[2:32:14] &gt;&gt; and to be wise.
[2:32:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:32:18] &gt;&gt; To lead his people. You got to be
[2:32:19] faithful
[2:32:20] &gt;&gt; and you got to be wise.
[2:32:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:32:22] &gt;&gt; Come on. We clear.
[2:32:24] &gt;&gt; We clear.
[2:32:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:32:25] &gt;&gt; To give them what?
[2:32:27] &gt;&gt; Meat.
[2:32:27] &gt;&gt; In what?
[2:32:28] &gt;&gt; In due season.
[2:32:29] &gt;&gt; Do you see that again? So the one on top
[2:32:32] of the household of God
[2:32:34] &gt;&gt; is not just the ruler.
[2:32:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:32:38] &gt;&gt; Is not that just there to give command.
[2:32:42] &gt;&gt; You go there. You go there. No. No. No.
[2:32:44] No. No. No. The ruler is wise
[2:32:47] &gt;&gt; and he's also faithful. But the reason
[2:32:50] why he's wise is God is depending on the
[2:32:54] ruler
[2:32:55] &gt;&gt; to distribute food.
[2:32:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:32:58] &gt;&gt; There it is, brother. in due season.
[2:33:02] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:33:03] &gt;&gt; In other word, wisdom is again reflected
[2:33:06] by the ability to distribute food in due
[2:33:10] season.
[2:33:12] &gt;&gt; Oh Lord,
[2:33:13] &gt;&gt; I'm driving one point today stronger. So
[2:33:16] wisdom again is determined by the
[2:33:19] ability to synchronize with the season.
[2:33:23] Amen.
[2:33:24] &gt;&gt; If you don't give the food correctly,
[2:33:27] &gt;&gt; then you cannot rule God's house.
[2:33:30] &gt;&gt; That's why the scripture say properly
[2:33:33] &gt;&gt; dividing the word.
[2:33:35] &gt;&gt; You must know when is what message to
[2:33:38] give.
[2:33:41] &gt;&gt; You must know that now it's milk.
[2:33:44] &gt;&gt; Now it's a steak. Amen.
[2:33:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:33:47] &gt;&gt; The food is already there,
[2:33:49] &gt;&gt; but you got to know how to properly when
[2:33:52] which season to give what.
[2:33:55] &gt;&gt; So that's why a pastor must depend on
[2:33:58] God. The holy the preacher must depend
[2:34:03] on God to tell him which food
[2:34:06] &gt;&gt; to give in which season which message to
[2:34:10] preach
[2:34:14] &gt;&gt; because a word spoken in due season.
[2:34:18] &gt;&gt; A sermon given in the correct season,
[2:34:21] &gt;&gt; it's a sermon that is bringing healing.
[2:34:24] [Music]
[2:34:25] Amen.
[2:34:27] [Music]
[2:34:29] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:34:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:34:30] &gt;&gt; Luke even explained this this way. Luke
[2:34:33] say the Lord say who then is a faithful
[2:34:36] and what
[2:34:37] &gt;&gt; wise steward
[2:34:38] &gt;&gt; whom the Lord shall make ruler over
[2:34:41] what?
[2:34:41] &gt;&gt; His household
[2:34:42] &gt;&gt; to do what?
[2:34:43] &gt;&gt; Give them their portion
[2:34:44] &gt;&gt; of meat when
[2:34:45] &gt;&gt; in due season.
[2:34:46] &gt;&gt; The meat already belong to you.
[2:34:49] &gt;&gt; It is your portion
[2:34:50] &gt;&gt; but it have to be given in due season.
[2:34:52] Amen.
[2:34:53] &gt;&gt; So again, wisdom is connected to the
[2:34:57] ability to discern and to act on the
[2:35:00] season.
[2:35:01] &gt;&gt; If you are a steward correctly, that is
[2:35:04] wise. You have to watch the season
[2:35:06] &gt;&gt; before you give the food.
[2:35:09] &gt;&gt; So wisdom is connected to season. Wisdom
[2:35:12] of the earth connected to season.
[2:35:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:35:15] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:35:16] &gt;&gt; Let me finish with this scripture
[2:35:18] because I can't preach. I have to finish
[2:35:20] with the reading of the scripture.
[2:35:21] &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's finish with reading the
[2:35:24] scripture and we pick up next Sunday.
[2:35:27] &gt;&gt; Let's jump to Matthew 25.
[2:35:35] &gt;&gt; I don't know if it's sister Sharon who
[2:35:37] held this sermon until she comes back
[2:35:40] &gt;&gt; to hear it.
[2:35:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:35:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:35:44] &gt;&gt; You there?
[2:35:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:35:46] &gt;&gt; Then shall the kingdom of heaven be
[2:35:49] what?
[2:35:49] &gt;&gt; Likened unto 10 virgins.
[2:35:51] &gt;&gt; Uh-huh. You know this very well.
[2:35:55] &gt;&gt; Which took what?
[2:35:56] &gt;&gt; Their lamps
[2:35:57] &gt;&gt; and went forth to meet the who?
[2:35:59] &gt;&gt; The bridegroom.
[2:36:00] &gt;&gt; They were going to marriage.
[2:36:02] &gt;&gt; Verse two. And five of them were how?
[2:36:05] &gt;&gt; Were wise.
[2:36:06] &gt;&gt; You remember I was telling you about
[2:36:07] wise and foolish.
[2:36:09] &gt;&gt; You remember that?
[2:36:10] &gt;&gt; Five were what?
[2:36:12] &gt;&gt; Wise.
[2:36:12] &gt;&gt; And other were what?
[2:36:14] &gt;&gt; Foolish.
[2:36:14] &gt;&gt; We need to know what made the five wise.
[2:36:17] &gt;&gt; Come on, father.
[2:36:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:36:20] &gt;&gt; Ah. Ah
[2:36:22] &gt;&gt; flight attendant prepare for landing.
[2:36:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:36:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:36:28] &gt;&gt; One was called foolish.
[2:36:30] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[2:36:31] &gt;&gt; One is called wise.
[2:36:33] &gt;&gt; Why is one made the other one wise?
[2:36:38] &gt;&gt; One is wisdom reflected through.
[2:36:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:36:47] &gt;&gt; Verse verse three. They that were
[2:36:51] foolish did what?
[2:36:53] &gt;&gt; Took their lamps.
[2:36:54] &gt;&gt; Uh-huh. And but what?
[2:36:55] &gt;&gt; And took no oil with them.
[2:36:57] &gt;&gt; But the wise did what?
[2:36:59] &gt;&gt; Took oil in their vessels with their
[2:37:01] lamps.
[2:37:01] &gt;&gt; Uh-huh. So the scripture is describing
[2:37:04] to us the did
[2:37:07] &gt;&gt; the action
[2:37:09] &gt;&gt; of each group of the virgin.
[2:37:11] &gt;&gt; That's true.
[2:37:12] &gt;&gt; We got a foolish virgin and we got a
[2:37:14] wise virgin. The scripture now is
[2:37:16] describing as what made one foolish.
[2:37:20] And what made one what?
[2:37:23] &gt;&gt; And wisdom is described
[2:37:27] &gt;&gt; to the fact that one took oil
[2:37:33] &gt;&gt; beyond preparation time
[2:37:37] [Laughter]
[2:37:39] [Applause]
[2:37:44] &gt;&gt; spoken word tabernacle.
[2:37:46] When the opening of the the at the
[2:37:48] opening of the seals the Bible became
[2:37:51] what?
[2:37:51] &gt;&gt; Do you know how many time we read this
[2:37:53] quote this scripture? Look how it's
[2:37:55] coming up now.
[2:37:56] &gt;&gt; In other word when the virgin were
[2:37:59] preparing
[2:38:01] &gt;&gt; all of them were virgin.
[2:38:06] &gt;&gt; All of them were in the message.
[2:38:09] [Applause]
[2:38:13] All of them were virgin.
[2:38:16] &gt;&gt; All of them knew the same message.
[2:38:20] &gt;&gt; The message was we need to go meet the
[2:38:22] bridegroom.
[2:38:23] &gt;&gt; We need to go to the coming of the Lord.
[2:38:27] &gt;&gt; Because the bridegroom was coming.
[2:38:30] &gt;&gt; The Lord was coming. So all of them knew
[2:38:33] the message.
[2:38:35] And brother Brandham say virgin means
[2:38:38] that they were sanctified.
[2:38:40] &gt;&gt; So all of them were living good
[2:38:43] &gt;&gt; very good regalistic my people
[2:38:47] &gt;&gt; are we together
[2:38:49] &gt;&gt; but one group was wise
[2:38:52] &gt;&gt; one was what?
[2:38:54] &gt;&gt; Foolish.
[2:38:57] &gt;&gt; Both of them got lamp.
[2:39:02] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen.
[2:39:04] &gt;&gt; Both of them have lamp with oil.
[2:39:08] &gt;&gt; If you judge them by virgin, all of them
[2:39:12] enter.
[2:39:13] &gt;&gt; I'm going to the airport, my friend. So,
[2:39:16] buckle up. We going to land. If you
[2:39:18] judge them by the fact that both of them
[2:39:21] knew the bridegroom is coming, all of
[2:39:23] them will enter.
[2:39:25] &gt;&gt; If you judge them by the ability that
[2:39:27] they are all preparing to go meet the
[2:39:30] badgroom, all of them qualify. If you
[2:39:33] judge them by the ability that they got
[2:39:36] a lamp,
[2:39:37] &gt;&gt; all of them got a lamp.
[2:39:39] &gt;&gt; If you judge them by the ability that
[2:39:42] the lamp got oil,
[2:39:44] &gt;&gt; all of them qualify.
[2:39:46] &gt;&gt; But there is a difference.
[2:39:49] [Applause]
[2:39:51] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:39:53] &gt;&gt; Because brother Kelly, there was two
[2:39:55] season.
[2:39:57] &gt;&gt; I'm heading to the airport.
[2:40:00] I'm heading to the airport. There is a
[2:40:02] wedding season,
[2:40:05] &gt;&gt; a season to terry
[2:40:08] &gt;&gt; and wait for the bridegroom.
[2:40:11] &gt;&gt; And there was a season of the coming
[2:40:16] &gt;&gt; sle
[2:40:19] &gt;&gt; because the Bible says, let's read so we
[2:40:22] got it clear. Verse five, while the
[2:40:25] bridegroom did what?
[2:40:26] &gt;&gt; Terry,
[2:40:27] &gt;&gt; they all did what?
[2:40:28] &gt;&gt; Slumbered and slept.
[2:40:30] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[2:40:31] So there was a season of tearing.
[2:40:35] &gt;&gt; When the tearing season was there, every
[2:40:38] lamp was on.
[2:40:41] &gt;&gt; The oil that was in the lamp was for one
[2:40:45] season.
[2:40:47] [Laughter]
[2:40:47] [Applause]
[2:40:50] [Laughter]
[2:40:55] &gt;&gt; Spoken word.
[2:40:56] &gt;&gt; Are we together? The oil for the lamp
[2:40:59] was to last only for the wedding season.
[2:41:05] &gt;&gt; The oil of the lamp could not go over.
[2:41:09] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:41:11] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:41:13] &gt;&gt; Remember the ant when he's in the
[2:41:15] summer?
[2:41:16] &gt;&gt; He work for which month?
[2:41:19] &gt;&gt; A month ahead. So the foolish virgin as
[2:41:23] they are going
[2:41:24] &gt;&gt; they were not preparing only for the
[2:41:27] wedding.
[2:41:31] &gt;&gt; They were they were looking beyond the
[2:41:34] wedding.
[2:41:41] &gt;&gt; Let me start it again. The Bible say why
[2:41:44] the bridegroom Terry they all did what?
[2:41:50] Everybody slumber and slept.
[2:41:52] &gt;&gt; So if you want to disqualify everybody,
[2:41:55] you will disqualify everybody because
[2:41:57] all of them slumber and left.
[2:41:58] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:41:59] &gt;&gt; So the up to this point everybody's
[2:42:02] behaving the same.
[2:42:03] &gt;&gt; Everybody's bride.
[2:42:05] &gt;&gt; But watch now verse uh six. And at
[2:42:08] midnight there was a what?
[2:42:10] &gt;&gt; A cry made
[2:42:11] &gt;&gt; did what?
[2:42:12] &gt;&gt; Behold
[2:42:13] &gt;&gt; what?
[2:42:13] &gt;&gt; The bridegroom cometh.
[2:42:14] &gt;&gt; Go you out to what?
[2:42:16] &gt;&gt; To meet him. So a a a a shout came
[2:42:19] &gt;&gt; and introduced another season.
[2:42:23] &gt;&gt; Wow.
[2:42:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:42:25] [Music]
[2:42:27] &gt;&gt; Let me explain this so we can land.
[2:42:30] Okay.
[2:42:31] &gt;&gt; There is a difference between somebody
[2:42:33] who's waiting
[2:42:35] &gt;&gt; and somebody who has been informed that
[2:42:37] now they calling you.
[2:42:40] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[2:42:41] &gt;&gt; If you work with me, we get to the
[2:42:42] airport. My friend,
[2:42:44] &gt;&gt; somebody who's waiting will be sitting
[2:42:46] like this.
[2:42:48] &gt;&gt; Maybe sometime they pull their cell
[2:42:49] phone
[2:42:52] &gt;&gt; because they're waiting.
[2:42:53] &gt;&gt; Are we together? And they can get
[2:42:55] online. Some of them will be some of us
[2:42:57] will be even on the phone.
[2:42:58] &gt;&gt; Some will put FaceTime and then they
[2:43:00] continue because they know that they're
[2:43:02] waiting to be called by the doctor.
[2:43:04] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[2:43:05] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:43:07] &gt;&gt; So there is a behavior in the wedding.
[2:43:09] But when they say
[2:43:12] fat dog me
[2:43:15] &gt;&gt; the season have changed.
[2:43:18] &gt;&gt; If you are on the cell phone
[2:43:21] &gt;&gt; you got to j the cell phone. You got to
[2:43:23] pick up your stuff. You got to pick up
[2:43:26] everything. You got to remove everything
[2:43:28] for you. Your belongings in the playroom
[2:43:31] in the in the in the wedding room. You
[2:43:34] got to get your luggage ready
[2:43:36] &gt;&gt; because you going to enter. So when the
[2:43:39] midnight cry came he he he announc
[2:43:43] another season.
[2:43:45] &gt;&gt; So everybody that was slumbering
[2:43:48] &gt;&gt; and sleeping have to do what?
[2:43:51] &gt;&gt; Now another season open up
[2:43:53] &gt;&gt; and that season require another oil.
[2:43:58] [Applause]
[2:44:00] [Music]
[2:44:01] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Because when they woke
[2:44:04] up and they checked the lamp,
[2:44:07] &gt;&gt; let's let's read it. So you say it's
[2:44:08] coming from the Bible. We there
[2:44:11] &gt;&gt; then all verse seven. Then all those
[2:44:13] virgin did what?
[2:44:14] &gt;&gt; A rose.
[2:44:15] &gt;&gt; They qualify by being arosed.
[2:44:17] &gt;&gt; Amen. By being
[2:44:20] I mean reason. Amen. And all those
[2:44:22] virgin did what?
[2:44:23] &gt;&gt; A rose.
[2:44:24] &gt;&gt; And trim their what?
[2:44:25] &gt;&gt; Their lamps.
[2:44:26] &gt;&gt; And the foolish said to the wise, give
[2:44:29] us of water
[2:44:30] &gt;&gt; your oil. For our lamp are what?
[2:44:33] &gt;&gt; Are gone out.
[2:44:33] &gt;&gt; So the lamp was only lasting
[2:44:38] &gt;&gt; for a season
[2:44:41] &gt;&gt; and the bridegroom
[2:44:42] &gt;&gt; Terry
[2:44:44] &gt;&gt; until the first oil was gone.
[2:44:49] &gt;&gt; I'm I hope you are understanding me.
[2:44:52] &gt;&gt; Are we together? When the first oil was
[2:44:55] gone and the lamp was going out, that's
[2:44:59] when the bridegroom begin to come.
[2:45:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:45:03] &gt;&gt; When he came,
[2:45:05] the foolish now was now disclosed to be
[2:45:08] foolish
[2:45:10] &gt;&gt; because in the preparation time,
[2:45:14] &gt;&gt; they were not preparing ahead.
[2:45:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:45:20] They were preparing for the summer, but
[2:45:22] they were not preparing for the winter.
[2:45:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:45:26] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:45:27] &gt;&gt; So, the wisdom was determined by the
[2:45:31] ability.
[2:45:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:45:33] &gt;&gt; To prepare oil.
[2:45:35] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:45:36] &gt;&gt; For the oncoming season.
[2:45:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:45:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:45:41] &gt;&gt; Verse eight, then we finish. and give.
[2:45:44] And the foolish said to the wise, give
[2:45:46] us of your old, for our land our water
[2:45:49] &gt;&gt; are gone out.
[2:45:50] &gt;&gt; But the wise answered, saying, not so,
[2:45:53] lest there be not enough for who?
[2:45:55] &gt;&gt; Us and you.
[2:45:56] &gt;&gt; But you do what?
[2:45:57] &gt;&gt; Go ye rather to them that sell
[2:45:59] &gt;&gt; and do what?
[2:46:00] &gt;&gt; And buy for yourself.
[2:46:01] &gt;&gt; And while they went
[2:46:03] &gt;&gt; to do what?
[2:46:03] &gt;&gt; To buy.
[2:46:04] &gt;&gt; Now they begin to look for oil in the
[2:46:06] wrong season.
[2:46:08] There is
[2:46:10] &gt;&gt; they begin to look for the all in the
[2:46:12] wrong season. There was a season to
[2:46:15] prepare for the all. They missed the
[2:46:17] season. Now when another season is
[2:46:20] coming, they trying to get the all. They
[2:46:23] miss the bridegroom.
[2:46:26] &gt;&gt; Church learn to walk with the season.
[2:46:33] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Verse 10. And why they
[2:46:36] went to do what?
[2:46:37] &gt;&gt; Buy
[2:46:37] &gt;&gt; the bridegroom did what?
[2:46:39] &gt;&gt; Why is it that as soon as they left?
[2:46:43] &gt;&gt; They didn't have cell phone.
[2:46:44] &gt;&gt; No sir.
[2:46:44] &gt;&gt; They didn't have iPad.
[2:46:46] &gt;&gt; As soon as they left, what happened?
[2:46:49] &gt;&gt; Bridegroom came.
[2:46:50] &gt;&gt; The bridegroom came
[2:46:52] &gt;&gt; and they found which oil was now kicking
[2:46:54] in.
[2:46:55] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:46:55] &gt;&gt; The second
[2:46:56] &gt;&gt; the second oil was kicking in for the
[2:46:58] marriage.
[2:47:02] &gt;&gt; Are we together? He said the bridegroom
[2:47:04] came and they that were how
[2:47:07] &gt;&gt; ready
[2:47:07] &gt;&gt; what made them ready?
[2:47:09] &gt;&gt; The second oil
[2:47:10] &gt;&gt; they were by what? The ability to pick
[2:47:12] up the second oil
[2:47:14] &gt;&gt; toward the journey made them wise.
[2:47:17] &gt;&gt; In other words, they prepare for the
[2:47:19] oncoming season.
[2:47:21] &gt;&gt; They were not going in man with the
[2:47:23] wedding season.
[2:47:24] &gt;&gt; They were going with the wedding season
[2:47:27] and the coming season together.
[2:47:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:47:32] Maybe when they were picking up oil,
[2:47:35] their friend were making fun of him.
[2:47:40] &gt;&gt; The friend say, "What else do you have?"
[2:47:43] We already got one bottle.
[2:47:45] &gt;&gt; Huh? Why do you need two bottles?
[2:47:48] &gt;&gt; But
[2:47:50] we only have one bottle. Why do you need
[2:47:52] two bottles? But what happened to the
[2:47:54] first bottle?
[2:47:58] &gt;&gt; The first bottle is finished. The
[2:48:00] bridegroom has come.
[2:48:02] &gt;&gt; The ability to carry two bottle
[2:48:05] &gt;&gt; is what was the wisdom at.
[2:48:10] &gt;&gt; Today you going to church.
[2:48:13] &gt;&gt; Today you're reading the message. Today
[2:48:15] you're going to question and answer. You
[2:48:17] going to young men meeting. You going to
[2:48:19] young sister. You are investing your
[2:48:22] time. And while your friend
[2:48:25] &gt;&gt; other young people are having fun,
[2:48:28] &gt;&gt; they are going for party.
[2:48:30] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[2:48:31] &gt;&gt; They are going for meeting. They are
[2:48:34] going for young people gathering. They
[2:48:36] are following after any kind of young
[2:48:39] people recreational,
[2:48:41] young people concert. But you are
[2:48:44] staying focused because one of this day
[2:48:47] when you will begin to use the second
[2:48:50] oil, you will see them broke.
[2:48:53] You will see them lingering
[2:48:55] &gt;&gt; because they miss the season. Let
[2:48:58] whoever make fun of you, let them make
[2:49:01] fun of you. You stay focused.
[2:49:05] Focus in the season.
[2:49:08] Focus in the working. Focus to get the
[2:49:11] second oil.
[2:49:13] [Music]
[2:49:15] Because there will come a time when you
[2:49:17] will be relaxing with the bridegroom
[2:49:20] &gt;&gt; and other people are going
[2:49:24] &gt;&gt; and they suffer. And do you know the gut
[2:49:26] oil?
[2:49:29] &gt;&gt; It's written in the Bible.
[2:49:30] &gt;&gt; Do you know the gut oil?
[2:49:32] &gt;&gt; We don't know when but they all was not
[2:49:34] valid.
[2:49:36] &gt;&gt; When they came back they knock.
[2:49:40] &gt;&gt; It was too late.
[2:49:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:49:43] The other one were there getting beside
[2:49:45] themselves,
[2:49:46] &gt;&gt; beside the king that day.
[2:49:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the other one was outside. The
[2:49:50] Bible say in nashing of teeth. You take
[2:49:53] this spiritually and naturally.
[2:49:55] Spiritually somebody missed the rapture.
[2:49:58] &gt;&gt; When you are investing, somebody will
[2:49:59] miss the rapture.
[2:50:01] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Because by the ability
[2:50:03] to predict the future
[2:50:06] &gt;&gt; and God send us an ego.
[2:50:10] &gt;&gt; William Marion Brana And he gave us
[2:50:13] signal
[2:50:14] &gt;&gt; to know the season. When you see a woman
[2:50:17] rising in America wearing purple, when
[2:50:21] you see a second Catholic president,
[2:50:23] when you see a Catholic pope,
[2:50:26] &gt;&gt; the season is clear, what are you doing?
[2:50:32] &gt;&gt; Instead of getting ready for the going,
[2:50:35] you are playing around. But that's for
[2:50:38] me and my house.
[2:50:39] [Applause]
[2:50:42] As for me and my wife, we will serve the
[2:50:45] Lord.
[2:50:47] &gt;&gt; Are we together?

[2:50:49] &gt;&gt; Wisdom is described by the ability
[2:50:54] &gt;&gt; the ability
[2:50:55] &gt;&gt; to synchronize with the season.

[2:55:34] nobody sees you
[2:55:36] &gt;&gt; and you don't understand and you begin
[2:55:38] to pump. You put your picture on
[2:55:40] Facebook, you put your picture on
[2:55:42] Instagram, you make all kind of video to
[2:55:44] make uh attraction. Nobody sees that
[2:55:48] because you are synchronizing out of
[2:55:50] season
[2:55:51] &gt;&gt; and you are putting effort in something
[2:55:54] that you are not supposed to turn around
[2:55:56] and find if this is not working what is
[2:55:59] supposed to be in this season
[2:56:01] &gt;&gt; and work on that one.

[2:56:09] &gt;&gt; some of you I'm I don't even blame you
[2:56:11] because it's a move in the message
[2:56:13] &gt;&gt; with young people. It was happening
[2:56:15] between the churches. I don't mind
[2:56:17] fellowship with other churches but I'm
[2:56:19] careful because I don't want spirit.
[2:56:21] Brother Brandham say churches got
[2:56:23] spirit.
[2:56:26] &gt;&gt; I don't want you to go somewhere and
[2:56:27] pick up spirit from there.

[2:56:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:56:42] &gt;&gt; But if you stay in your season, they
[2:56:43] will come to you and say, "Please tell
[2:56:45] us how do you do this? How did you end
[2:56:47] up like this?"
[2:56:50] &gt;&gt; But it's a move under the fellowship of
[2:56:53] the message of the hour. Then it's a
[2:56:55] move. If it start somewhere over there,
[2:56:57] it's going to catch fire there. It catch
[2:56:58] fire. Catch fire. Fire. Okay, we did a
[2:57:00] bonfire here. Okay, other young people
[2:57:02] also would do bonfire over there. Then
[2:57:04] other would do bonfire there. Then then
[2:57:06] it's bonfire everywhere and then it's
[2:57:08] something over there and and and it's
[2:57:09] like a
[2:57:10] &gt;&gt; moveh
[2:57:15] a wise young man, a wise young sister,

[3:10:02] Yes,
[3:10:02] &gt;&gt; father.
[3:10:04] &gt;&gt; You know the reason why you don't want

[3:10:13] are here visible and invisible audience.
[3:10:16] Father, I pray Lord that this goes
[3:10:18] deeper than the brain. May you drop down
[3:10:21] into the soul Lord of your children so
[3:10:24] that they can catch the revelation and
[3:10:26] understand that the spirit of the Lord
[3:10:29] cannot speak in vain.

[3:10:36] So that Lord, your children can be
[3:10:38] completely and totally delivered
[3:10:42] and be prepared for what you're trying
[3:10:45] to bring in their life. Father,
[3:10:49] may you go with the congregation. May

[3:10:54] they review, may you come down and
[3:10:57] quicken and show them a clear path of
[3:11:01] what they need to do because the hour is
[3:11:04] late for your coming. The hour is late
[3:11:07] for many things, Lord. Father, help
[3:11:10] spoken word, help your children. Those
[3:11:12] that travel, Father, give them travel
[3:11:14] mercy. Those that are struggling, Lord,
[3:11:17] may you deliver them. Those that the
[3:11:19] devil has been pulling away, may you
[3:11:21] deliver them. those that are blinded,
[3:11:23] may you remove that blindness like you
[3:11:25] did for Gazi. Father, I pray in the name
[3:11:28] of Jesus Christ that your grace and
[3:11:30] mercy be upon us. Strengthen us and be
[3:11:32] with us on this oncoming week. Lord, we
