[1:04:23] solomon open up here
[1:04:26] to keep our heart
[1:04:29] i know the last couple weeks when we
[1:04:32] were talking the emphasize was put on
[1:04:35] the tongue
[1:04:36] refrain the tongue refrain the tongue
[1:04:38] keep the tongue keep the tongue now
[1:04:40] solomon is going beyond what we can see
[1:04:44] because when we talk we can see our
[1:04:46] tongue somebody you can look at somebody
[1:04:48] talking you can see their teeth you can
[1:04:50] see their tongue now solomon goes beyond
[1:04:53] what you can see and solomon say
[1:04:57] take care of the heart
[1:04:59] what is wrong with the heart
[1:05:01] solomon say out of the heart
[1:05:04] are the issues of life
[1:05:07] so the things that you see in life
[1:05:12] the things that you see
[1:05:14] that you witness
[1:05:15] or the course of the event in your life
[1:05:19] according to solomon
[1:05:22] they are all originating
[1:05:26] they originate
[1:05:28] from where
[1:05:31] from the heart
[1:05:35] life and death in the power of god
[1:05:40] so if your life is in trouble who did it
[1:05:43] the tongue solomon say the heart
[1:05:47] is are they contradicting
[1:05:51] watch verse 24
[1:05:53] put away from you a water
[1:05:57] do you see where solomon start
[1:05:59] solomon start first at the heart
[1:06:03] amen
[1:06:04] he said guard this man
[1:06:06] then from the heart
[1:06:08] which is number one
[1:06:10] solomon move
[1:06:12] to the mouth
[1:06:14] or to the tongue
[1:06:16] we already understand this now mouth
[1:06:18] tongue lips all these things amen
[1:06:23] solomon say on verse 24 put away from
[1:06:27] you a forward
[1:06:29] mouth
[1:06:30] and perverse water
[1:06:33] put far from you
[1:06:36] so who
[1:06:38] command
[1:06:39] is the lips
[1:06:41] speaking really or it's the heart
[1:06:43] talking
[1:06:47] amen
[1:06:49] if i take your tongue i put it there is
[1:06:51] he going to talk
[1:06:54] so who's really talking
[1:06:57] anybody clear
[1:06:58] let's go to mark 7.
[1:07:03] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:07:20] with everything that we have we should
[1:07:22] be having the lowest case of divorce in
[1:07:25] the message
[1:07:28] with the word that we have
[1:07:33] amen
[1:07:34] mark chapter 7
[1:07:37] if you dare you can say amen
[1:07:39] verse 6.
[1:07:41] he answered and said to them
[1:07:43] well has isaiah prophesies
[1:07:48] of you who
[1:07:50] hypocrite
[1:07:52] as it is written
[1:07:54] these people honor me with their
[1:07:58] so a hypocrite has a problem
[1:08:04] a hypocrite
[1:08:08] say something else with his lips
[1:08:12] or mouth
[1:08:13] or tongue
[1:08:16] amen
[1:08:19] these people honors me with their lips
[1:08:23] but
[1:08:24] that's a contradiction there
[1:08:26] their water
[1:08:28] is far from who
[1:08:30] so the heart of a hypocrite
[1:08:33] says something else
[1:08:36] amen and his tongue is also saying
[1:08:40] something else
[1:08:41] so there is no
[1:08:43] continuity
[1:08:44] between the heart and the tongue
[1:08:48] anybody clear
[1:08:49] in other words i love you but really i
[1:08:53] hate you
[1:08:56] but what hypocrites don't understand
[1:08:59] is
[1:09:00] the issues of life
[1:09:04] comes from the water
[1:09:06] so regardless of how much they can talk
[1:09:10] amen
[1:09:12] their heart sense vibrations
[1:09:18] their heart creates
[1:09:20] a milky atmosphere
[1:09:24] amen
[1:09:25] that if a person is spiritual that's
[1:09:29] what they're catching
[1:09:34] and sometimes when they naive
[1:09:37] they will say
[1:09:39] lord i don't want to think bad about
[1:09:40] them i'm sorry
[1:09:43] you didn't decode that
[1:09:46] [Music]
[1:09:47] [Laughter]
[1:09:50] it's time to eat chew to chew hard food
[1:09:53] let's go to verse 15.
[1:09:56] there is nothing
[1:09:58] from outside a man
[1:10:00] that entering into him can do what
[1:10:04] or can make him unclean
[1:10:08] it's not about the food
[1:10:11] it can cause you problem with your
[1:10:13] cholesterol or something like that but
[1:10:15] it's not really in front of god that's
[1:10:18] not it amen except if you go beyond what
[1:10:21] you're supposed to eat
[1:10:23] then you sin
[1:10:24] amen
[1:10:26] that entering into him can defile him
[1:10:30] but the things which come out of who
[1:10:33] those are they that defile the man
[1:10:37] not the food that enter make you unclean
[1:10:41] but it is what is coming out of you that
[1:10:44] makes you unclean
[1:10:46] if any man have ears to hear
[1:10:50] let him hear
[1:10:52] and when he was entered into the house
[1:10:54] from the people
[1:10:56] his disciple asked him concerning the
[1:10:58] parable we didn't understand that
[1:11:01] and he said to them are you so
[1:11:04] without understanding also
[1:11:07] do you not water
[1:11:09] in other words do you not understand
[1:11:11] that whatsoever
[1:11:13] things from outside
[1:11:15] enter into the man
[1:11:17] he cannot defile him
[1:11:20] because he entered not into the water
[1:11:25] make sense
[1:11:26] in other words your food doesn't go in
[1:11:28] the heart
[1:11:29] your food goes to the stomach
[1:11:33] amen
[1:11:34] biology
[1:11:37] besides because he entered not into his
[1:11:40] heart
[1:11:41] but into the water
[1:11:43] and goes out into the drought purging
[1:11:46] all meat that's your digestive system
[1:11:49] that have nothing to do with it
[1:11:52] and he said that which come out of the
[1:11:55] man
[1:11:57] that defiles the man
[1:12:00] for
[1:12:01] from inside which inside
[1:12:04] from inside out of the water
[1:12:07] the heart of a man proceed water
[1:12:12] evil thoughts
[1:12:14] adulteries
[1:12:15] fornications
[1:12:17] murderers
[1:12:19] theft
[1:12:20] covetousness wickedness
[1:12:23] deceit
[1:12:25] lasciviousness
[1:12:26] an evil eye
[1:12:28] blasphemy
[1:12:30] pride
[1:12:31] foolishness all these evil things come
[1:12:35] from water
[1:12:36] and default the water so now you
[1:12:39] understand why solomon is saying
[1:12:42] keep your heart
[1:12:44] because this is the one that caused you
[1:12:46] trouble
[1:12:47] the mouth is just
[1:12:49] expressing what is coming under
[1:12:52] anybody clear
[1:12:54] praise be the name of the lord let's go
[1:12:56] to mark 11.
[1:13:00] you're talking about the heart
[1:13:04] and the tongue
[1:13:05] we talk about the tongue and the hell
[1:13:07] the tongue and the power
[1:13:09] now we're talking about the tongue
[1:13:11] and the heart anybody clear

[1:13:16] if you dare you can say amen
[1:13:19] some are still turning their pages
[1:13:23] you're there
[1:13:25] verse 12.
[1:13:28] and on the morrow
[1:13:31] they were
[1:13:32] come from bethany
[1:13:34] he was hungry that's jesus
[1:13:37] and seeing a fig tree afar off
[1:13:40] having leaves
[1:13:42] he came
[1:13:43] if happily in other words perhaps he
[1:13:46] might find anything there on
[1:13:48] and when he came to it
[1:13:50] he found nothing but leaves we already
[1:13:53] talked to you about it for the time of
[1:13:55] fig
[1:13:56] was not yet
[1:13:58] why did he go at the time when figs were
[1:14:01] not there
[1:14:02] he got to curse that thing from eating
[1:14:05] amen
[1:14:07] and jesus answered
[1:14:09] and said to it
[1:14:12] in my name
[1:14:17] are you awake
[1:14:21] if you're sleeping i'm wondering
[1:14:24] no man
[1:14:26] eat fruit of you here after
[1:14:29] forever
[1:14:31] and his disciple
[1:14:33] heard it
[1:14:34] was that hard to talk
[1:14:36] was that hard
[1:14:38] you just turn around you say hey
[1:14:40] no man will eat food then he continues
[1:14:44] and nothing happened
[1:14:46] but something happened
[1:14:49] nothing happened to the eye
[1:14:51] but something happened
[1:14:55] jesus never stood there and said i'm
[1:14:57] going to sleep here until i see this
[1:14:59] tree falling down
[1:15:01] that's not his problem
[1:15:06] amen
[1:15:07] verse 19.
[1:15:09] and when the evening was gone what was
[1:15:11] come
[1:15:12] he went out of the city he finished what
[1:15:14] he did he went to the city
[1:15:17] they never even heard him talking about
[1:15:19] that tree
[1:15:20] like peter go ahead and check again the
[1:15:22] tree that i talked about
[1:15:24] he he spoke and he forgot
[1:15:27] and he continued his daily life when he
[1:15:29] finished he went out of the city
[1:15:31] and in the morning now the next day
[1:15:34] as they passed by
[1:15:36] they saw the fig tree
[1:15:38] dried up from the what
[1:15:42] see now
[1:15:45] okay and peter
[1:15:47] peter is a problem
[1:15:50] calling to remembrance say to him
[1:15:53] master
[1:15:54] behold the fig tree which you cursed
[1:15:59] is withered away
[1:16:01] and jesus answering said to them
[1:16:04] have faith in god
[1:16:07] for verily i say
[1:16:10] to you
[1:16:11] that whosoever
[1:16:14] shall say to this water
[1:16:17] how can you move from a tree to a
[1:16:19] mountain
[1:16:23] a tree is small
[1:16:24] everybody can believe that
[1:16:26] so jesus take you to the stream
[1:16:30] to blow
[1:16:32] up to get you out of the box
[1:16:37] to get you to a
[1:16:39] different height
[1:16:41] what you really look and you say this is
[1:16:43] too big wow look at this mountain jesus
[1:16:46] say forget about the tree look at that
[1:16:49] mountain there
[1:16:52] that whatsoever shall say to this
[1:16:55] mountain
[1:16:56] be that removed
[1:16:59] and be that cast into the sea
[1:17:02] and shall not doubt in his
[1:17:12] jesus is saying
[1:17:14] if you go in
[1:17:16] two

[1:17:24] okay
[1:17:25] and you don't doubt in number one
[1:17:28] that mountain will move
[1:17:31] so who is really moving the mountain
[1:17:35] out of the
[1:17:37] heart come the issues of life
[1:17:41] so their heart can move something
[1:17:49] really yes
[1:17:52] if you don't really like somebody
[1:17:56] you don't even have to tell him
[1:18:01] if you really mean it
[1:18:03] the problem is you must mean it
[1:18:06] if you don't mean it then it's a
[1:18:07] different story
[1:18:10] amen
[1:18:10] if you take a decision in your life for
[1:18:13] something
[1:18:15] it depends on how you're taking decision
[1:18:18] if you really took decision on something
[1:18:23] even if that person is in europe

[1:19:22] where he is
[1:19:23] far away from his home
[1:19:26] if he can really believe
[1:19:30] that knife will move home
[1:19:36] and begin to travel
[1:19:40] without an airplane
[1:19:44] and get into brother branham pocket
[1:19:48] and brother branham will reach out to
[1:19:51] the pocket
[1:19:53] and pull the knife
[1:19:55] it is not magic
[1:20:02] what you call magician they are
[1:20:04] impersonator
[1:20:06] [Music]
[1:20:08] it's a perversion
[1:20:16] did i lose somebody
[1:20:23] have you ever sat somewhere
[1:20:25] and you talking to someone
[1:20:27] [Laughter]
[1:20:30] and suddenly you will see your head move
[1:20:36] and when you move you watch somebody
[1:20:38] there long way back

[1:20:46] who told you that person is watching you
[1:20:53] who was the radar that was around there

[1:21:08] how did you communicate
[1:21:12] how
[1:21:13] what was the telephone did you text him
[1:21:17] texting is a copy
[1:21:23] amen
[1:21:26] how can you come out of the bathroom
[1:21:31] and you meet a young man
[1:21:33] and you shake his hand god bless you god
[1:21:35] bless you fine and you go

[1:21:43] different about you
[1:21:47] you know what i'm talking about right
[1:21:49] right
[1:21:50] if he comes again
[1:21:54] and shake your head

[1:21:59] this man
[1:22:02] is there's something funny about him now

[1:22:36] but shall do what
[1:22:40] believe that those things which he shall
[1:22:43] say
[1:22:44] come to pass
[1:22:45] he shall have whatsoever he says
[1:22:51] therefore i say to you what things so
[1:22:54] ever
[1:22:55] you desire
[1:22:57] when you
[1:22:59] believe that you did water
[1:23:03] and you shall
[1:23:07] [Music]
[1:23:11] if you don't have it it means water
[1:23:15] you have not believed

[1:23:25] don't worry we'll be okay let's go ahead
[1:23:27] and pray
[1:23:29] heavenly father
[1:23:31] lord we thank you again for your grace
[1:23:33] your love your mercy and for everything
[1:23:35] you have been doing for us
[1:23:37] father thank you for giving us another
[1:23:39] opportunity to gather together around
[1:23:42] the reveal world of the hour
[1:23:44] father i'm rebuking every demonic spirit
[1:23:49] of destruction
[1:23:51] of sleepiness
[1:23:53] everything that is trying to trouble the
[1:23:55] mind of your children not to focus to
[1:23:58] the word i rebuke them away from this
[1:24:01] place to the dry places in the name of
[1:24:04] jesus christ father may you come and
[1:24:06] speak to us so may you move me
[1:24:09] completely out of the way may you come
[1:24:11] and speak to this church and minister to
[1:24:14] us be the alpha and the omega the
[1:24:17] beginning and the ending of this service
[1:24:19] as we committed all unto the hand in the
[1:24:22] name of jesus christ
[1:24:24] amen
[1:24:26] god bless you all
[1:24:30] in 1st peter chapter 3 last week and the
[1:24:33] week before
[1:24:34] we read for he
[1:24:36] that we love life
[1:24:38] and see good days let him do water
[1:24:41] refrain his strong from water and he
[1:24:44] sleeps that they speak no water
[1:24:47] you want to see good days you're going
[1:24:50] to love life
[1:24:51] avoid the headache amen
[1:24:54] we are here on part 16 the second death
[1:24:57] we're talking about the tongue
[1:24:59] and the heart before we go into the lake
[1:25:03] of fire everybody clear so far
[1:25:06] when we talk about this rich young ruler
[1:25:09] we saw the rich young ruler in hell
[1:25:13] and when we saw him in hell
[1:25:16] the rich young ruler
[1:25:18] pointed out to us
[1:25:20] one spot
[1:25:21] that was burning more than any other
[1:25:23] spot
[1:25:24] that was the tongue
[1:25:26] now we know what goes in hell
[1:25:29] is not the body of a man
[1:25:32] what goes in hell
[1:25:34] is the spirit and the soul
[1:25:37] of a man
[1:25:38] put your belt because i'm going to
[1:25:40] travel a different avenue anybody clear
[1:25:44] the bible say in ecclesiastes 12 7
[1:25:48] then
[1:25:50] shall the dust
[1:25:51] return to the earth as it was
[1:25:55] the dust here is your body
[1:25:58] because the body is made out of the
[1:26:00] earth the 16th element of the earth so
[1:26:03] the scripture here is saying that your
[1:26:05] body will return to the earth
[1:26:08] that's why we take the body to the
[1:26:09] cemetery and we bury it there but
[1:26:12] eventually it's going to return back to
[1:26:14] the earth
[1:26:15] and the spirit
[1:26:17] shall return unto whom
[1:26:19] unto god who gave it
[1:26:23] so when you die
[1:26:25] your body goes somewhere else
[1:26:28] but your spirit picks up and go to a
[1:26:31] different place
[1:26:33] anybody clear
[1:26:34] in luke chapter 23 verse 46
[1:26:38] the bible said that when jesus had cry
[1:26:41] with a loud voice he said father into
[1:26:44] the hand i command what
[1:26:47] and having said that he gave up though
[1:26:50] because the spirit goes to whom
[1:26:54] but not all spirit
[1:26:57] goes to god
[1:27:00] but here it depends on the origin
[1:27:05] it depends where you come from
[1:27:08] if you came from god
[1:27:10] you're gonna return back to god
[1:27:13] if you didn't come from god
[1:27:15] then your spirit will go into a
[1:27:17] different place
[1:27:20] anybody clear
[1:27:21] in first peter chapter 3 verse 19
[1:27:24] by which we also
[1:27:27] by which also he went and preached unto
[1:27:30] the water
[1:27:31] the spirit in water and that prison is
[1:27:34] hell
[1:27:36] ever clear
[1:27:37] for us the body without the water
[1:27:40] the spirit is water
[1:27:42] we know that man is a trying being
[1:27:46] we are body
[1:27:50] we are spirit
[1:27:53] and we are soul
[1:27:55] and here
[1:27:56] when you look here all this scripture
[1:27:59] are talking about the spirit
[1:28:02] none of them is talking about the souls
[1:28:05] everybody
[1:28:06] and james here is saying that the body
[1:28:10] without the water
[1:28:11] the spirit is dead
[1:28:14] why is james not talking about the soul
[1:28:18] anybody clear
[1:28:20] i told you to keep your seat belt
[1:28:22] blessed be the name of the lord in psalm
[1:28:25] chapter 16 verse 10 david said
[1:28:29] for thou will not leave my water
[1:28:32] my soul in water
[1:28:36] so james
[1:28:38] is talking about what happened
[1:28:41] when you're alive
[1:28:43] anybody care
[1:28:45] but when you depart from your body
[1:28:48] david picks it up and begin to talk more
[1:28:52] about the soul
[1:28:55] hallelujah
[1:28:57] amen
[1:28:58] neither will that suffer than holy one
[1:29:01] to see corruption
[1:29:04] for great
[1:29:06] psalm 86 for great is that mercy toward
[1:29:10] me
[1:29:11] and that has delivered my water
[1:29:14] my soul from the lowest health
[1:29:17] anybody clear
[1:29:19] in first kings chapter 17
[1:29:22] verse 21 the bible said and he stretched
[1:29:25] himself upon the child three times the
[1:29:27] child was dead
[1:29:28] and cry unto the lord and say o lord my
[1:29:32] god
[1:29:32] i pray thee let this child water
[1:29:36] come think to him again
[1:29:39] why he didn't call his spirit
[1:29:43] and the lord heard the voice of elijah
[1:29:47] and the soul
[1:29:49] of the child came into him again and he
[1:29:54] revived
[1:29:55] anybody
[1:29:57] when it's living we have a tendency to
[1:30:00] say spirit
[1:30:02] when he dies then the soul picks it up
[1:30:06] anybody clear
[1:30:08] in revelation 6 verse 9 the bible said
[1:30:11] and when he has opened the fifth seal
[1:30:14] i saw under the altar the water
[1:30:20] anybody clear
[1:30:22] the bible say in the book of first peter
[1:30:25] that he was the spirit in prison
[1:30:29] but when brother branham comes
[1:30:32] and one brother branham preaches brother
[1:30:34] branham called that the
[1:30:36] souls in prison
[1:30:42] are you there
[1:30:43] when you are leaving
[1:30:45] everybody here
[1:30:47] we have the body
[1:30:49] which is the outside
[1:30:51] then we have your spirit and back here
[1:30:55] then the inside of the inside is what we
[1:30:59] call the soul
[1:31:00] anybody care
[1:31:02] this body that you enter in when you are
[1:31:05] born
[1:31:07] when you enter into your body your body
[1:31:11] was designed
[1:31:13] as a computer
[1:31:16] everybody clear
[1:31:18] if your body was designed with the
[1:31:22] element
[1:31:23] to contact the earth
[1:31:26] anybody care anybody clear
[1:31:29] when a person leaves their body
[1:31:32] they can be standing right there
[1:31:35] but if they touch you you don't feel it
[1:31:38] do you follow me
[1:31:40] the only way you can make contact with
[1:31:42] them they need to go back again into the
[1:31:45] body
[1:31:46] anybody clear
[1:31:48] so when you really enter the body of a
[1:31:50] man
[1:31:52] there is two
[1:31:54] spots in the body that are very
[1:31:56] important the first one is the brain
[1:32:03] and the second one
[1:32:05] is the heart
[1:32:07] anybody clear
[1:32:08] so when you're coming from the lord and
[1:32:11] you enter the body
[1:32:13] your spirit in the body
[1:32:16] usually take the first place
[1:32:21] i'm are you following me
[1:32:23] are you following me
[1:32:25] are you following me
[1:32:27] your body what he does he gather
[1:32:30] information for you
[1:32:32] but the body cannot process
[1:32:35] your information
[1:32:37] anybody clear
[1:32:38] if you take a computer you put it here
[1:32:41] you can put a computer here as much as
[1:32:44] you want that computer will do nothing
[1:32:46] to you
[1:32:47] anybody here you must take that computer
[1:32:50] and plug it to the wall
[1:32:54] did you follow me
[1:32:55] then something will come from the wall
[1:32:58] that is called electricity
[1:33:02] do you follow me
[1:33:03] and that electricity enter into the
[1:33:06] computer ever here and begin to turn on
[1:33:10] the computer on
[1:33:13] the day you cut off the electricity
[1:33:16] the computer is dead
[1:33:18] [Music]
[1:33:20] do you follow me the computer without
[1:33:24] power is dead
[1:33:28] the body without the spirit is dead
[1:33:33] the power that moves your body is your
[1:33:36] spirit
[1:33:38] do you follow me
[1:33:40] so when your spirit enter
[1:33:43] the body will look
[1:33:45] and say i see a man
[1:33:47] that is sitting there that wear a suit
[1:33:50] and he have a tie and he's a caucasian
[1:33:54] and he has beard and everything that's
[1:33:56] what your body pulled
[1:33:57] and your body bring it and leave it
[1:33:59] there
[1:34:00] then your spirit enter
[1:34:02] and work on it say he's like this his
[1:34:05] name is brother abel
[1:34:08] the body cannot tell you it's variable
[1:34:11] the one who reasoned the one who decoded
[1:34:14] the one who understand who work on the
[1:34:18] information is your spirit
[1:34:20] so your intelligence is not in your
[1:34:23] brain
[1:34:29] are you there
[1:34:30] the brain is just the software
[1:34:33] the brain is a hardware
[1:34:36] that the power must enter
[1:34:38] and begin to use the material day
[1:34:42] when you die
[1:34:43] you will withdraw completely and
[1:34:46] everything that is there will be
[1:34:48] destroyed
[1:34:50] do you follow me
[1:34:52] so when you enter into your body when
[1:34:55] you are born
[1:34:56] your spirit take the lead
[1:35:01] do you follow me quick
[1:35:02] is everybody okay
[1:35:04] and your soul take the second place
[1:35:11] did you follow me
[1:35:12] so when you entering you coming from god
[1:35:16] when these two elements enter the body
[1:35:19] the spirit take over your brain
[1:35:24] and your soul take over your heart
[1:35:30] everybody here
[1:35:31] so the one that functioned a lot that
[1:35:35] make a lot of contact with the body is
[1:35:38] your spirit
[1:35:43] because he's the one doing the reasoning
[1:35:45] he's the one doing the affection he's
[1:35:48] the one working with the conscience
[1:35:51] here the body have five senses
[1:35:55] and the spirit also have five senses
[1:35:59] that's why they're both matches
[1:36:02] but the soul doesn't have five senses
[1:36:06] are we okay
[1:36:07] if you're sleeping you can stand up back
[1:36:09] there
[1:36:10] everybody
[1:36:11] so when you are still living
[1:36:14] your soul is usually your back part
[1:36:20] anybody care
[1:36:21] so a human being has a tendency to work
[1:36:26] with his spirit
[1:36:29] this spirit here is what solomon called
[1:36:36] understanding everybody clear that
[1:36:39] understanding is the center of your
[1:36:42] intelligence
[1:36:44] that's why solomon say lean not unto
[1:36:48] their own
[1:36:50] anybody here everybody here
[1:36:53] everybody here
[1:36:54] but when you die
[1:36:58] you follow me
[1:36:59] when you die paul says when this
[1:37:03] tabernacle is dissolved
[1:37:06] we have a different tabernacle that is
[1:37:09] coming up
[1:37:10] everybody here that tabernacle that
[1:37:13] comes
[1:37:14] is called a theophany
[1:37:19] we okay
[1:37:20] when that your family comes ever clear
[1:37:24] the leadership is no longer to your
[1:37:28] spirit
[1:37:30] anybody here
[1:37:32] that your family which is that spiritual
[1:37:36] body
[1:37:37] ever hear your soul
[1:37:39] take over the theophany
[1:37:44] in your natural body your spirit is
[1:37:48] first and your theopha annual and your
[1:37:51] soul is in the back
[1:37:53] but when you enter your theophany the
[1:37:56] soul take the leadership
[1:38:04] hallelujah
[1:38:05] blessed be the name of the lord brother
[1:38:08] branham said the difference between an
[1:38:10] animal and a man
[1:38:12] god put a soul in a man
[1:38:15] and he didn't put it in the animal
[1:38:18] because they saw
[1:38:20] that was in the man is that water
[1:38:28] how can a soul be a theophany
[1:38:32] theophany is a body
[1:38:34] soul is a part of you but brother
[1:38:36] branham said that so is that theophany
[1:38:42] in question and answer on hebrew brother
[1:38:45] branham say
[1:38:47] his body was in there
[1:38:49] that's jesus and his son was in water
[1:38:53] preaching alive
[1:38:55] what about that he was in his water
[1:38:59] in his theophany again
[1:39:01] he saw
[1:39:02] everybody clear was down there with
[1:39:05] those people that were in the theophany
[1:39:08] also
[1:39:12] so in the theophany the soul take over
[1:39:16] that's why when a sinner wants to die
[1:39:20] you're gonna hear him say i am lost
[1:39:23] what is speaking is no longer his spirit
[1:39:27] it is the soul that he grieves
[1:39:29] is taking over because he's going to a
[1:39:32] theophany
[1:39:36] anybody clear
[1:39:38] who is this merchandise after you
[1:39:40] recognize
[1:39:42] the very word of god was ego food
[1:39:46] then you left the other things
[1:39:49] you have been formed into the living
[1:39:52] image of the water
[1:39:55] you heard from your water
[1:40:00] the wonder heard is not your intellect
[1:40:04] it is the
[1:40:07] that soul
[1:40:07] have a communication with your theophany
[1:40:11] [Music]
[1:40:13] anybody here
[1:40:15] so when the rich young ruler went to
[1:40:17] hell
[1:40:18] and was talking
[1:40:20] it was his soul
[1:40:23] that was talking
[1:40:24] and he saw
[1:40:26] pointing out to us
[1:40:28] the tonga
[1:40:31] anybody clear so far
[1:40:34] praise be to the name of the lord now
[1:40:36] that in james chapter 1 we found out
[1:40:39] that if any man among you seems to be
[1:40:42] religious
[1:40:44] and brother not his water
[1:40:46] he but deceiveth his own water
[1:40:50] why is the connection between the two
[1:40:55] because the heart
[1:40:56] that's where the soul stays
[1:40:59] hey
[1:41:00] this man religion is water
[1:41:03] then
[1:41:04] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:41:06] the bible says in proverbs 21 23 who saw
[1:41:10] keeping his water
[1:41:12] and his water
[1:41:14] keep his water
[1:41:19] we okay now
[1:41:21] you okay now
[1:41:22] what was the witch young ruler talking
[1:41:29] that he was burning in hell
[1:41:31] everybody clear
[1:41:32] so now we see that there is a connection
[1:41:35] between the tongue and the soul or the
[1:41:39] heart
[1:41:40] anybody clear
[1:41:42] what is going on with the heart
[1:41:49] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:41:52] in proverbs 21
[1:41:54] verse 2
[1:41:55] the bible says
[1:41:57] every way of who
[1:42:01] amen
[1:42:02] is right
[1:42:04] in his own eyes
[1:42:09] but the lord
[1:42:10] pondered the water
[1:42:12] let me go back again
[1:42:15] every way of a man
[1:42:18] is right in his own eyes
[1:42:25] man is a big trouble
[1:42:29] anybody care
[1:42:30] everything that a human being does
[1:42:34] it is good for him
[1:42:38] anybody care
[1:42:40] anybody here everybody here
[1:42:43] everything that man does the way man was
[1:42:47] wired
[1:42:48] the way man was built
[1:42:50] whatever he does
[1:42:53] it's good
[1:42:57] everybody here
[1:42:58] that's why we have trouble
[1:43:01] a high
[1:43:03] opinionated man is a curse
[1:43:14] opinion that woman is a curse
[1:43:21] anybody here
[1:43:22] a proud spirit is a curse
[1:43:29] everybody
[1:43:30] because the way man
[1:43:33] was wired everything he does is correct
[1:43:38] that's why we have stubborn children
[1:43:45] that's why we have stubborn father we
[1:43:49] have stubborn wives we have stubborn
[1:43:52] husband because everything they do is
[1:43:55] right
[1:44:00] if you tell a child
[1:44:01] don't put your hand in a fire
[1:44:04] they don't get it you don't understand
[1:44:07] why they're getting why they don't get
[1:44:09] it because what he does is correct
[1:44:13] if you put water over there and a lot of
[1:44:16] mud there you let the little child go
[1:44:18] the child will go and jump on a mud
[1:44:23] when an adult look he said don't do that
[1:44:25] he said why that's not fair
[1:44:31] why because everything he does
[1:44:34] to his own eyes his water
[1:44:42] you see why you gotta die
[1:44:45] you see why you gotta die you see why
[1:44:48] you gotta die

[1:45:03] nobody can tell me what to do i can
[1:45:05] choose what i'm doing
[1:45:10] if everything you do is right

[1:45:58] this is why people have a hard time
[1:46:01] changing
[1:46:04] it takes 10 years
[1:46:06] for you to realize that your wife was
[1:46:09] right
[1:46:13] it takes five years
[1:46:15] for you to realize that your husband was
[1:46:18] right
[1:46:20] you must go through a lot of headache
[1:46:23] to realize that the pastor was right
[1:46:30] everything that man does in his own eyes
[1:46:33] is water
[1:46:36] let's go to first corinthians 13.
[1:46:41] hallelujah
[1:46:42] the tongue and the heart
[1:46:45] everybody clear
[1:46:47] first corinthians 13 verse 11.

[1:46:55] we have a lot of pharaohs
[1:46:59] egypt to destroy egypt destroy egypt
[1:47:02] destroy still he's stubborn
[1:47:07] you spend five years you wasted
[1:47:11] and you're still insisting on what
[1:47:13] you're doing
[1:47:17] don't you see egypt is destroyed no
[1:47:26] first corinthians chapter 13 verse 11.
[1:47:29] are you there
[1:47:30] when i was a water
[1:47:33] i spoke as water
[1:47:42] and i understood as what
[1:47:45] i thought as a what
[1:47:47] there is three words there
[1:47:51] paul say when i was a child i did what
[1:47:56] speak
[1:47:57] spoke
[1:47:58] which is talking about what the month
[1:48:03] everybody clear
[1:48:04] then i did water
[1:48:07] you understand where
[1:48:12] i understand
[1:48:14] with my heart
[1:48:16] and the first and the third one is what
[1:48:19] thinking what do you think
[1:48:26] you're reasoning
[1:48:28] baby
[1:48:30] your heart
[1:48:31] baby
[1:48:33] you're talking baby
[1:48:35] and when they try to correct you i know
[1:48:38] what i'm doing
[1:48:43] hallelujah
[1:48:45] but when i became a worker
[1:48:48] i put a white water
[1:48:51] so if you didn't listen to mama
[1:48:54] how many mistakes you gonna make
[1:48:57] if you didn't listen to daddy how many
[1:48:59] mistake are you making
[1:49:02] because daddy was dead
[1:49:04] daddy made the same mistake
[1:49:07] and that is telling you don't do it
[1:49:10] it's gonna be hard for you to understand
[1:49:13] daddy because the way you are wired
[1:49:16] everything that you do is right
[1:49:19] you must understand this
[1:49:22] so you can break yourself
[1:49:24] and begin to open your ear to begin to
[1:49:27] be subordinate to someone else
[1:49:34] hallelujah
[1:49:36] the bible says in luke chapter 2 52
[1:49:40] and jesus increase in water
[1:49:50] why didn't jesus preach before 30 years
[1:49:53] old
[1:49:56] i'm asking you a question
[1:49:58] why did jesus why didn't jesus preach
[1:50:01] before he was 30 years old
[1:50:03] the only time we encountered something
[1:50:06] he was 12 years old when the black dog
[1:50:08] opened up
[1:50:10] all he did he corrected by the word
[1:50:14] but he has to wait until the jordan eva
[1:50:20] do you follow me when the holy ghost
[1:50:22] enter into him
[1:50:24] then jesus started the ministry
[1:50:30] everybody here so far
[1:50:33] the bible said he grew increasing wisdom
[1:50:36] the heart and stature the normal body in
[1:50:40] favor with god and with who
[1:50:43] it didn't happen the same day
[1:50:47] in john chapter 8 verse 28
[1:50:51] then jesus said unto them when you have
[1:50:54] lift up the son of man
[1:50:56] then shall you know that i am who
[1:50:59] and i do nothing of water
[1:51:13] has done what
[1:51:15] i speak this water i do nothing
[1:51:22] i have to wait for him
[1:51:24] because everything that i do
[1:51:26] is going to be right in my eyes
[1:51:30] hallelujah and he that sent me is with
[1:51:34] me

[1:51:59] because i don't want to go through
[1:52:01] suffering but the father will you must
[1:52:03] go through this trial because the whole
[1:52:06] race of adam need to be
[1:52:12] john chapter 1 verse 3
[1:52:14] and whatsoever we ask
[1:52:17] we receive of him
[1:52:19] because we kept his water
[1:52:21] and do those things that are water
[1:52:25] pleasing in which cycle
[1:52:28] who are you trying to please
[1:52:33] who are you pleasing
[1:52:36] galatians 1 chapter 10
[1:52:38] 4 do i now persuade man
[1:52:41] oh god
[1:52:44] there's two masters there
[1:52:48] who are you persuading on your facebook
[1:52:54] god
[1:52:55] so when you put a picture you are saying
[1:52:57] god i'm putting up this picture so you
[1:52:59] can see how i am today
[1:53:02] god i'm gonna post this video so you're
[1:53:05] gonna see how i was dancing at home
[1:53:09] who are you
[1:53:10] pleasing who are you pleasing
[1:53:13] who are you pleasing
[1:53:16] who are you pleasing
[1:53:17] because you're waiting for that like
[1:53:20] like a like
[1:53:26] waiting for somebody to say it is
[1:53:28] beautiful
[1:53:29] you look gorgeous
[1:53:35] everything that you do in your own eyes
[1:53:40] persuade men of god or do i seek to
[1:53:44] please who
[1:53:45] for if i yet please man
[1:53:48] i should not be the servant of water
[1:53:53] are you servant of christ
[1:53:55] who are you pleasing
[1:54:01] who are you pleasing
[1:54:03] you're not fooling me
[1:54:05] every way of a man is righteous in his
[1:54:08] in his own eye but the lord pondered the
[1:54:11] water
[1:54:12] god is looking at the motive
[1:54:16] everybody here
[1:54:18] in the exposition of the seven churches
[1:54:21] brother branham said the name laodicea
[1:54:24] which means what
[1:54:27] notice the name laodicea means what
[1:54:31] people's right or what
[1:54:34] this age is prone
[1:54:37] to give you a high opinion of yourself
[1:54:42] it is an edge that gives you right
[1:54:45] this is my right
[1:54:50] you don't listen to nobody
[1:54:53] nobody can tell you something
[1:54:57] hallelujah
[1:54:59] jeremiah 10 verse 22
[1:55:01] oh lord i know that the water
[1:55:06] the way of who
[1:55:08] every way of man is water
[1:55:11] but the way of man is water
[1:55:18] so even though you are programmed
[1:55:22] even though you are created
[1:55:25] that everything that you do is right
[1:55:29] the purpose of god was not for that
[1:55:34] do you follow me
[1:55:36] the purpose of god
[1:55:38] it is not in man that worketh to direct
[1:55:42] his water
[1:55:43] man was made to be dependent on the
[1:55:47] higher power
[1:55:54] hallelujah
[1:55:55] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:55:58] jesus said abide in me and i in you as
[1:56:02] the brunch cannot bear fruit of itself
[1:56:05] except it abide in the vine
[1:56:07] no more can ye accept he abiding me
[1:56:11] i am divine
[1:56:13] ye are the branches he that abided me
[1:56:16] and i in him the same bringeth forth
[1:56:19] much water for without me he can do
[1:56:26] so the way you were brought in this
[1:56:29] world everything you do correct in your
[1:56:32] eyes
[1:56:33] but god is speaking through jeremiah
[1:56:36] that you are not supposed to be directed
[1:56:39] yourself
[1:56:40] you are supposed to be depending on
[1:56:43] order
[1:56:47] everybody clear
[1:56:48] everybody clear so far blessed be the
[1:56:51] name of the lord how can we get to that
[1:56:53] order
[1:56:54] the bible says that the brother branham
[1:56:57] said you say the church has to go
[1:57:00] through the persecution the church
[1:57:03] for the perfection of it
[1:57:05] the blood of jesus christ perfected the
[1:57:07] water there is a difference between the
[1:57:09] church and the bride
[1:57:11] the church goes to the tribulation not
[1:57:13] the blood because he has perfected us on
[1:57:16] calvary
[1:57:18] a man who chooses a wife don't put her
[1:57:21] through a lot of punishment
[1:57:23] he's already found grace
[1:57:25] too with her she has found grace with
[1:57:28] him he engages to her and if there is
[1:57:31] anything he shall keep her from every
[1:57:34] place to turn her hand his grace is so
[1:57:38] great upon them so will it be upon the
[1:57:41] bread
[1:57:42] and so is it on the brand we are worthy
[1:57:45] creatures
[1:57:47] deserving of hell
[1:57:49] but his grace holds us through it look
[1:57:52] at how many people lost
[1:57:54] and blind how many how many sinners was
[1:57:58] there in the world the hour i got saved
[1:58:01] god saved me for a water
[1:58:10] god served me for a purpose and i am
[1:58:13] determined by his will to do that
[1:58:17] i don't care what anything else goes i
[1:58:20] want to do it
[1:58:22] so the purpose of god to perfect you to
[1:58:26] serve you to redeem you to rescue you is
[1:58:29] for a purpose
[1:58:36] what is that purpose
[1:58:38] that god is trying to get you let's go
[1:58:40] to james
[1:58:41] chapter three
[1:58:43] why does god want to rescue you
[1:58:46] what is that purpose
[1:58:50] you were born everything you do right
[1:58:57] we need to humble ourselves
[1:59:00] and we need to be mindful of our
[1:59:02] weaknesses
[1:59:06] recognize the strength in your husband
[1:59:10] recognize the strength in your wife
[1:59:13] recognize the strength in your children
[1:59:15] recognize the strength in your parent
[1:59:20] james chapter 3 verse 7 he saved me for
[1:59:24] a purpose everybody
[1:59:27] you there
[1:59:29] verse 7
[1:59:30] for every kind of water
[1:59:34] and off
[1:59:35] and of serpent
[1:59:37] and of things in the sea
[1:59:39] is
[1:59:41] and has been tame of water
[1:59:46] man
[1:59:48] had the dominion of everything
[1:59:51] he controlled
[1:59:53] they see he controlled the animal
[1:59:56] kingdom he control the bird he controls
[1:59:59] everything
[2:00:00] everything that man does he can claim it
[2:00:03] and control it everything is working
[2:00:05] perfect
[2:00:07] thank god
[2:00:08] verse eight
[2:00:10] but the water
[2:00:15] he saved you for a purpose
[2:00:17] but the tongue can water
[2:00:25] do you have control over your tongue
[2:00:28] no
[2:00:29] you cannot control it
[2:00:32] you need somebody else
[2:00:38] it makes sense
[2:00:39] but the tongue can no maintain
[2:00:43] it is a water
[2:00:46] an unruly evil full of deadly water
[2:00:51] but solomon said what is in the tongue
[2:00:54] really comes from the heart
[2:01:01] hallelujah
[2:01:03] verse nine dare with
[2:01:06] we bless god even the father and dare
[2:01:10] with
[2:01:11] because we men
[2:01:13] which are made after the similitude of
[2:01:16] god in other words in the image and
[2:01:19] likeness of god
[2:01:21] out of the same
[2:01:24] mouth proceeded what
[2:01:26] and what
[2:01:27] my breath and these things are not so to
[2:01:30] be
[2:01:36] he saves you for a purpose
[2:01:40] does a fountain send forth us at the
[2:01:43] same place sweet water and bitter
[2:01:47] can the fig tree my brethren bear all
[2:01:49] his berries
[2:01:51] either a vine figs
[2:01:53] so can no fountain both yield salt water
[2:01:57] and water
[2:01:58] so we found here james is saying
[2:02:01] man can control everything
[2:02:05] but man cannot control himself
[2:02:10] he can control the animal that's why we
[2:02:14] have the zoo
[2:02:15] because man master the lion and put him
[2:02:18] in a zoo he mastered the elephant put
[2:02:20] him in the zoo he mastered the serpent
[2:02:23] put him in the zoo he mastered the bird
[2:02:25] put him in a zoo but man cannot control
[2:02:28] himself
[2:02:30] he cannot control his mouth he cannot
[2:02:32] control his tongue he cannot control his
[2:02:35] heart
[2:02:38] so who's going to control
[2:02:41] everybody
[2:02:43] the bible's brother problem say christ
[2:02:45] died that cavalry
[2:02:48] how that he went up to that cross
[2:02:51] i was reading a little book here not
[2:02:53] long ago
[2:02:55] that onto some kind of a research and in
[2:02:58] this research i found something more
[2:03:01] startling
[2:03:02] i sat down and i laid the book down and
[2:03:06] raised up my hands and praised god got
[2:03:09] up and walked around a little bit and
[2:03:11] sat down and read it again so brother
[2:03:14] branham got a hold of a research
[2:03:17] and when he was reading
[2:03:19] that research got brother branham on
[2:03:22] fire
[2:03:23] brother branham job the research he
[2:03:25] raised his hand he praised god he
[2:03:28] praised god he went back again pick up
[2:03:30] the research and read it again what was
[2:03:32] in that research
[2:03:35] brother bonham said i thought
[2:03:38] oh is that so
[2:03:40] that on this same hill
[2:03:43] where jesus was crucified
[2:03:46] adam died and was buried on the same
[2:03:50] hill that jesus died on
[2:04:01] and was buried on the same hill where
[2:04:04] adam died
[2:04:06] he died on golgotha and was buried on
[2:04:10] golgotha and i thought what appropriate
[2:04:13] whether he was right or wrong
[2:04:16] let's say he was right then the first
[2:04:18] adam died and was buried and there yet
[2:04:22] in the dust because he represented the
[2:04:25] water
[2:04:26] the world and the people to sin but the
[2:04:29] second adam being the god of heaven when
[2:04:32] he died on golgotha there was not enough
[2:04:35] earth to hold him there he rolls on the
[2:04:39] third dead and he's alive forever more
[2:04:42] but the sin problem is what
[2:04:45] where are them represented as of a day
[2:04:49] as soon jesus claimed on the same place
[2:04:53] and died right there to represented us
[2:04:56] as redeemed and served by the grace of
[2:04:59] god
[2:05:03] hallelujah
[2:05:05] he saved us for a purpose
[2:05:09] what is the purpose he saved me
[2:05:11] because i could not enter myself i could
[2:05:14] not control my tongue i could not
[2:05:17] control my mouth i could not control my
[2:05:20] lips i could not control my heart i
[2:05:22] needed a savior but thank god that
[2:05:25] savior came and crammed on god and gave
[2:05:29] his life to save me
[2:05:33] [Music]
[2:05:35] hallelujah
[2:05:36] when man was saved
[2:05:40] the veil of the temple was ripped into
[2:05:44] showing to man that now we can enter the
[2:05:47] presence of god
[2:05:53] and not only do you enter the presence
[2:05:55] of god
[2:05:56] but god himself can enter men
[2:06:04] hallelujah
[2:06:06] blessed be the name of the lord
[2:06:08] now on the day of pentecost
[2:06:13] the atonement went
[2:06:15] received in heaven
[2:06:17] then christ came and divided himself
[2:06:20] and sat like a pillar like tongues of
[2:06:23] fire
[2:06:25] and the first thing we did he did he
[2:06:28] entered
[2:06:36] anybody here
[2:06:38] as soon as he entered the heart
[2:06:40] the first member he catches is there
[2:06:46] [Music]
[2:06:51] are you there
[2:06:53] now paul
[2:06:56] please son
[2:06:58] of jesus christ
[2:07:00] [Music]
[2:07:02] i do nothing except today
[2:07:09] hallelujah
[2:07:11] and they were all filled with the holy
[2:07:13] ghost and begin to speak with other what
[2:07:17] he catches the heart
[2:07:19] he catches the tongue what is going on
[2:07:22] when he catches the heart
[2:07:24] brother bottom said the first throne was
[2:07:26] in water
[2:07:28] the judgment seat
[2:07:31] the second throne was in
[2:07:34] the third tron is in water
[2:07:39] [Music]
[2:07:41] so god is perfected in three
[2:07:44] so god finish his strand when he can
[2:07:48] empty man
[2:07:55] what is a man
[2:07:57] he's a trying being
[2:07:59] body soul and spirit how many knows that
[2:08:02] watch god approach
[2:08:04] watch god approach what is his heart you
[2:08:08] remember my message god chooses demands
[2:08:11] for his water
[2:08:13] the devil choses his water
[2:08:16] for his control tower he makes him see
[2:08:19] things look through his eyes but god in
[2:08:22] his heart
[2:08:23] make him believe things that he cannot
[2:08:29] everybody here
[2:08:31] god is on his heart
[2:08:33] in the heart of man is the throne of who
[2:08:37] you gathered man god made it strong in
[2:08:40] the heart of
[2:08:47] no man
[2:08:48] can tame the tongue
[2:08:51] there is only one man
[2:08:53] that there was no fault found in him
[2:08:56] so when he went up he came down entered
[2:08:59] the heart so he can control the tongue
[2:09:03] anybody clear
[2:09:05] anybody clear
[2:09:06] the little the reason that that little
[2:09:09] compartment that is in your heart god
[2:09:11] murdered you that way
[2:09:13] that was for uh
[2:09:15] that little part in your heart all the
[2:09:18] rest of your body belongs to him
[2:09:21] to you
[2:09:22] but
[2:09:23] that heart belongs to us
[2:09:29] [Music]
[2:09:30] gents say if i can control the tongue
[2:09:34] i'm going to control what
[2:09:38] brother branham said the body belongs to
[2:09:39] you but he want to get the heart
[2:09:43] because once he get the heart you're not
[2:09:46] even controlling the body anymore
[2:09:49] anybody clear
[2:09:52] but the heart belongs to god that god
[2:09:55] made himself a little room in there
[2:09:57] so he could set in the controlling
[2:10:01] and that he could do what
[2:10:03] because you were programmed not to leave
[2:10:06] for yourself
[2:10:07] anybody
[2:10:09] oh if i would let him beat the water
[2:10:13] and
[2:10:14] the water
[2:10:15] we will be guarded over the water
[2:10:19] it is his control
[2:10:29] so now when christ enter he already
[2:10:32] programmed a control room
[2:10:35] he get into the heart he sits there as a
[2:10:37] pilot
[2:10:40] go to james chapter 3 again
[2:10:44] let's go to verse 3.
[2:10:47] behold
[2:10:48] we put water
[2:10:50] in the horse's mouth remember last
[2:10:52] sunday
[2:10:54] when they put bits in beats on horse's
[2:10:56] mouth it means there is a carriage
[2:10:58] there is a load that is coming up there
[2:11:00] is a workforce that is coming up for the
[2:11:04] horse to carry
[2:11:06] so when jesus enter into you
[2:11:09] he also
[2:11:10] put beats on you
[2:11:14] he brother your tongue
[2:11:16] because he has something to do with you
[2:11:20] he has work that he have not finished
[2:11:22] he's going to finish it in the brother
[2:11:25] anybody clear
[2:11:27] now no more your will but the wheel off
[2:11:30] there
[2:11:32] everybody here
[2:11:34] behold we put bits in horse's mouth
[2:11:37] that they may obey us
[2:11:42] so you may
[2:11:43] obey us and we turn about their whole
[2:11:46] body
[2:11:47] behold also
[2:11:49] the sheep
[2:11:51] which though they be so great
[2:11:55] are driven
[2:11:57] a fierce wind
[2:11:59] yet
[2:12:00] our dead turnabout with a very small
[2:12:04] water
[2:12:05] so
[2:12:06] james is saying that there is a ship
[2:12:10] a big ship
[2:12:12] anybody clear
[2:12:13] in this ship there is a room
[2:12:17] where the pilot goes
[2:12:19] all the master
[2:12:21] goes
[2:12:22] anybody care
[2:12:23] in that little room there is a little
[2:12:26] helm
[2:12:28] in other words a steering wheel
[2:12:31] anybody care
[2:12:32] anybody clear but that will
[2:12:35] jim say
[2:12:37] that
[2:12:38] turn about with a very small ham verse
[2:12:41] four
[2:12:42] wherever they were
[2:12:44] the governor
[2:12:46] the governor is the pilot
[2:12:49] in other words wherever the pilot desire
[2:12:53] that's where the pilot works so james
[2:12:56] here is showing us
[2:12:58] that there is a boat
[2:13:00] that boat has a control room
[2:13:06] you follow you you follow me then that
[2:13:09] control room has a steering wheel
[2:13:12] but you need a pallet
[2:13:16] clear and brother branham said the pilot
[2:13:19] is crushed
[2:13:21] and he's going to move the plane or he's
[2:13:24] going to move the boat
[2:13:26] where he desire
[2:13:29] regardless of what the wind is doing
[2:13:32] outside
[2:13:37] you follow me you follow me
[2:13:40] even though the wind is big
[2:13:43] even though the wind is strong even
[2:13:46] though you feel like you are touched
[2:13:48] left and right
[2:13:50] let the pilot do the steering
[2:13:55] do you follow me
[2:13:56] one day the pilot slept
[2:14:05] here
[2:14:06] and he put the what in automatic pallets
[2:14:12] and when the devil saw that the devil
[2:14:14] came
[2:14:15] and began to ship to move the ship left
[2:14:18] and right
[2:14:20] instead of the disciple
[2:14:22] remembering that the pilot was there the
[2:14:25] disciple begin to do work
[2:14:34] instead of the disciple
[2:14:36] awakening him
[2:14:39] they begin to do work
[2:14:44] we were fishermen
[2:14:46] we know what to do
[2:14:47] so what do we do we have a lot of
[2:14:50] luggage throw the luggage out
[2:14:52] lost throw the luggage out lost throw
[2:14:55] the luggage out
[2:14:57] let's go this way let's go they're
[2:14:59] sweating and the pilot is sleeping
[2:15:04] he never walk and say what kind of noise
[2:15:06] is there
[2:15:07] let them keep doing what they're doing
[2:15:10] until they get tired
[2:15:11] he was just sleeping there
[2:15:13] and their work their work their work
[2:15:16] until they got tired
[2:15:19] one remember say wait a minute
[2:15:24] where is jesus
[2:15:28] are you there
[2:15:30] he's sleeping over there
[2:15:32] master
[2:15:34] wake up
[2:15:36] we're dying
[2:15:39] he walks
[2:15:43] we're perishing
[2:15:48] what's wrong look look what's going on
[2:15:55] they thought he's gonna look at that
[2:15:57] he just went
[2:16:05] peace
[2:16:06] be still
[2:16:11] are you there
[2:16:12] and suddenly
[2:16:17] if you have called him a long time
[2:16:22] would you have worry
[2:16:24] would you have lost what you lost
[2:16:27] how many luggage did you throw out
[2:16:30] how many headaches did you have in life
[2:16:33] how many troubles did you cause yourself
[2:16:36] how many things did you lose
[2:16:40] how many bad debts did you put yourself
[2:16:43] into
[2:16:45] that your credit is bad
[2:16:48] that your debt is high
[2:16:50] because you forgot to call on him
[2:16:56] are you there
[2:16:57] so peter so james is saying there is a
[2:17:01] pilot here all he needs is give him the
[2:17:03] steer
[2:17:04] don't worry about the wind
[2:17:06] he's going to move the plane
[2:17:09] hallelujah
[2:17:11] blessed be the name of the lord
[2:17:14] james says here in verse five
[2:17:17] even so
[2:17:18] that tongue is a little member
[2:17:22] and booster water
[2:17:29] behold
[2:17:31] how
[2:17:32] great a mother
[2:17:33] a little fire does what
[2:17:39] you started like a little fire before
[2:17:42] you know it they called the fire
[2:17:43] department
[2:17:45] anybody clear
[2:17:47] watch verse six and the tongue is a what
[2:17:52] why is the rich young ruler wanting to
[2:17:54] tame his tongue
[2:17:57] the tongue
[2:17:59] is a fire a water
[2:18:02] a cosmos
[2:18:05] of iniquity
[2:18:07] so is the tongue among our water
[2:18:11] that he defies the whole world
[2:18:15] but jesus said the one who defiled the
[2:18:17] body was there
[2:18:23] we okay now jesus said out of there
[2:18:27] now james say from there
[2:18:32] you see now
[2:18:34] that he defers the whole body
[2:18:36] and set on fire the water
[2:18:40] i thought solomon said the course of
[2:18:43] nature comes from the
[2:18:47] the issues of life
[2:18:49] we
[2:18:50] okay and set on fire the course of
[2:18:54] nature and is set on fire of what
[2:19:02] who set the tongue on fire
[2:19:07] the rich young ruler was where
[2:19:11] war was on fire
[2:19:13] and who set the tongue on fire
[2:19:18] hell
[2:19:21] everybody here
[2:19:22] but when you redeem it's a different
[2:19:24] story
[2:19:26] when god made man he made him dust for
[2:19:30] he made this little certain compartment
[2:19:32] in the man for his own throne his
[2:19:35] control tower
[2:19:37] god wants to lead men but man wants to
[2:19:40] lead himself
[2:19:41] therefore there is a water
[2:19:44] constantly the man wants to go after
[2:19:47] what he sees with his eyes
[2:19:50] that is where he is deceived
[2:19:52] that is what satan deceived
[2:19:55] by what she could see the fruit was
[2:19:58] present today
[2:20:00] but it was death to the what
[2:20:03] god want to lead man so he made himself
[2:20:06] a little contact control tower in the
[2:20:09] midst of his heart so that man will be
[2:20:12] led by the water
[2:20:15] getting off on his own
[2:20:18] is what separated him from his water
[2:20:24] ever here
[2:20:25] god doesn't want you to lead yourself
[2:20:28] in revelation 10 we found out that the
[2:20:32] bible said and when i went to into the
[2:20:34] angel
[2:20:35] i said to him give me the little book
[2:20:39] you remember last sunday
[2:20:41] and he said unto me
[2:20:43] take it and do it
[2:20:49] not only take the book
[2:20:52] because you are worthy now but when you
[2:20:55] take the book to what
[2:20:58] why do you eat it
[2:21:01] in school
[2:21:02] i had a classmate in high school
[2:21:07] and he was cheating
[2:21:09] anybody care
[2:21:12] and you know back in the days when we
[2:21:14] were cheating
[2:21:16] when the
[2:21:18] the students were cheating
[2:21:20] before they tested the exam
[2:21:22] they would take little papers and write
[2:21:24] stuff on the paper and keep the paper
[2:21:27] so when the test started they pulled the
[2:21:30] paper and began to cheat
[2:21:33] so the teacher was there
[2:21:35] in the front
[2:21:37] and the teacher saw him
[2:21:39] and he said hey you that stop you teach
[2:21:42] you you are cheating
[2:21:44] so the teacher was coming
[2:21:46] to get the evidence
[2:21:49] do you follow me
[2:21:50] off the little paper
[2:21:52] in order to get him and to give him a
[2:21:55] zero
[2:22:02] do you follow me
[2:22:04] my friend stood
[2:22:06] and took the pepper
[2:22:08] and folded the pepper
[2:22:10] and put it in his mouth and eat it and
[2:22:13] swallow it
[2:22:20] are you there
[2:22:21] the evidence was gone
[2:22:23] in other words there is no more that the
[2:22:26] teacher can get the paper out of his
[2:22:29] belly
[2:22:30] because the book was in the hands of
[2:22:33] adam
[2:22:34] when adam sinned
[2:22:36] the book was taken out of adam and
[2:22:39] brought into heaven so now this time in
[2:22:43] revelation 10 when god brought the book
[2:22:47] don't keep it in your hand
[2:22:50] swallow the book
[2:22:52] [Applause]
[2:22:54] swallow the book
[2:22:56] when you swallow it
[2:22:58] you and the book are one
[2:23:00] even god cannot pull the book from you
[2:23:03] again
[2:23:04] when you move the book move when you
[2:23:07] jump the book jump when won the book one
[2:23:11] you and the book are water
[2:23:14] [Applause]
[2:23:19] hallelujah
[2:23:20] there is nowhere again that the book can
[2:23:24] leave you and go back to the original
[2:23:26] serum
[2:23:27] that was in adam
[2:23:29] in christ it's forever the book is in
[2:23:32] the bread
[2:23:33] digested there is no way you can put the
[2:23:36] book again
[2:23:43] hallelujah
[2:23:44] the bible says eat it up
[2:23:47] [Music]
[2:23:49] no more coming and say give the book
[2:23:52] because you sin
[2:23:53] when god come he said give me the book
[2:23:56] you say which book
[2:23:58] the book i gave it to you go ask the one
[2:24:01] on calvary
[2:24:06] the book is already blood
[2:24:09] it had been digested
[2:24:11] enter into my bloodstream so i don't
[2:24:13] know which part of the bread the blood
[2:24:16] is your book
[2:24:21] if you want to take the book there is
[2:24:23] one way you must take me too
[2:24:28] [Applause]
[2:24:30] are you there
[2:24:32] you must take me to your right hand
[2:24:33] again
[2:24:36] you can't pull the book without pulling
[2:24:38] me
[2:24:43] hallelujah
[2:24:44] he said eat it up and he shall make the
[2:24:47] water
[2:24:49] not this belly
[2:24:51] the belly be there but it shall be in
[2:24:54] the mouth what so the book
[2:24:58] is making contact in two area
[2:25:04] it's making a contact in the mouth
[2:25:06] and a contact
[2:25:15] anybody care
[2:25:17] in the mouth it's sweet as honey i took
[2:25:20] the little book out of the angel hand
[2:25:23] and head it up
[2:25:25] the angel have no more book
[2:25:29] he's going to go back to heaven empty
[2:25:32] because to begin with it was not his
[2:25:35] book
[2:25:36] it was given to men
[2:25:38] now it's back to man again
[2:25:41] never to be lost again
[2:25:43] [Music]
[2:25:47] hallelujah
[2:25:48] and he was in my mouth sweet as honey
[2:25:51] and as soon as i added my belly was
[2:25:54] water
[2:25:55] and he said unto me damn much water
[2:26:00] why you didn't prophesy before you eat
[2:26:02] the book
[2:26:06] i want the book
[2:26:07] to touch your tongue
[2:26:11] and back here
[2:26:12] and then to go and sit in your heart
[2:26:15] when the book has purged your tongue
[2:26:20] and touch and sit in your heart
[2:26:22] because malachi 4 comes to return there
[2:26:28] everybody here
[2:26:30] now you can
[2:26:38] everybody clear
[2:26:39] the bible say all things happen brother
[2:26:41] branham said all things are possible to
[2:26:43] them that believe we got the untapped
[2:26:46] resources of god at our hand
[2:26:49] to display who
[2:26:51] we are sons and daughters of who
[2:26:53] when god made man he made him
[2:26:57] he gave him a dominion over the earth
[2:27:00] but his fallen state job but what they
[2:27:03] lost by
[2:27:05] he was restored by what
[2:27:08] he died on the same hill he said if you
[2:27:11] say to this water
[2:27:13] be moving don't doubt in you
[2:27:16] but believe what you say shall come you
[2:27:18] can have whatever you
[2:27:20] all thinks whatsoever you desire when
[2:27:23] you pray
[2:27:24] believe you receive it and you shall
[2:27:26] water
[2:27:27] he restored to us all that was lost in
[2:27:36] hallelujah
[2:27:37] blessed be the name of the lord brother
[2:27:40] branham says
[2:27:42] that he had a little book that john had
[2:27:44] eat to eat and when he did he got into
[2:27:48] his belly and he was bitter but in his
[2:27:51] lips it was sweet when you have to
[2:27:53] digest it then he gets
[2:27:57] against you
[2:27:58] everybody telling you you are holy
[2:28:00] roller
[2:28:01] you are decent doctor when you begin to
[2:28:04] have that sister charlene the book is
[2:28:07] getting digestion
[2:28:11] everybody here
[2:28:12] you are off your head
[2:28:15] so it is hard to digest it but when you
[2:28:18] are water
[2:28:20] of his glory it is what
[2:28:22] [Music]
[2:28:24] that's all when you stand up in a
[2:28:26] meeting you say glory to god
[2:28:30] the book is what
[2:28:34] hallelujah
[2:28:36] but then when you are out of that great
[2:28:39] siege you can testify often then it is
[2:28:42] sweet
[2:28:43] in your lips see that is right
[2:28:49] blessed be the name of the lord
[2:28:52] this issue with the book started from
[2:28:54] the old testament
[2:28:56] let me see where i am
[2:28:59] okay
[2:29:00] that word were found
[2:29:02] and i did eat them
[2:29:04] and that word was unto me
[2:29:07] the joy and the rejoicing of my
[2:29:10] for i am called by the name o lord god
[2:29:13] of host
[2:29:15] in ezekiel 2
[2:29:16] god say but that son of man hear what i
[2:29:20] say unto thee be not that rebellious
[2:29:23] like that rebellious house
[2:29:25] open the mouth and eat that i give you
[2:29:30] and when i look beyond a hand was sent
[2:29:33] unto me and lo a roll of a book was
[2:29:37] therein and he spread it before me and
[2:29:40] he was written within and without and
[2:29:44] there was written during lamentation and
[2:29:47] mourning and
[2:29:48] so what the prophet was saying
[2:29:51] was what was in the book
[2:29:57] after they have eaten the book
[2:30:00] everybody
[2:30:01] ezekiel 3
[2:30:03] moreover he said unto me son of man eat
[2:30:07] that darfundus eat this room
[2:30:10] and go speak unto the house of water
[2:30:13] so what the prophet was really speaking
[2:30:16] was not their thought
[2:30:20] it was what they have eaten
[2:30:25] i opened my mouth and he caused me to
[2:30:28] eat that room
[2:30:30] and he said unto me son of man
[2:30:32] cause that belly to eat and fill the
[2:30:35] bowels with this wall that i give you
[2:30:38] then i did eat it and it was in my mouth
[2:30:41] as honey for water
[2:30:43] and he said unto me son of man go get
[2:30:46] thee unto the house of israel and speak
[2:30:49] with my word unto
[2:30:51] we found out that prophecy
[2:30:54] was not given by the will of men
[2:30:58] the bible says that prophecy
[2:31:00] no prophecy of the scripture is of any
[2:31:04] prophet interpretation
[2:31:06] for the prophecy came not in the old
[2:31:09] time by the will of man
[2:31:13] it was not ezekiel who wanted to speak
[2:31:18] he was not jeremiah who wanted to speak
[2:31:22] god wanted to speak
[2:31:25] god took his word and put in the prophet
[2:31:28] and the prophet repeated
[2:31:31] what god say
[2:31:34] are you there
[2:31:36] for the prophecy came not in the old
[2:31:39] time by the will of man but holy men of
[2:31:42] god speak
[2:31:44] as they were moved by the water
[2:31:53] exodus 4 i'm heading to the airport
[2:31:56] and moses said unto the lord oh my lord
[2:31:59] i'm not eloquent
[2:32:01] neither he the toefl
[2:32:03] nor sins that has spoken unto that
[2:32:05] servant but i am slow of speech and slow
[2:32:08] of tongue and of slow tongue and the
[2:32:11] lord say unto him who has made man mouth
[2:32:14] and who maketh the dumb or death or the
[2:32:17] seeing or the plan have not i the lord
[2:32:21] now therefore
[2:32:23] go and i will be with that
[2:32:28] and teach thee what dasha
[2:32:31] so when the holy ghost enter into your
[2:32:34] heart
[2:32:35] he take a hold of what
[2:32:41] anybody care
[2:32:42] when the prophet was speaking they were
[2:32:45] not speaking with their own self
[2:32:49] somebody hold their mouth
[2:32:55] everybody clear
[2:32:56] blessed be the name of the lord
[2:32:59] but
[2:33:00] when they deliver you up
[2:33:04] did you deliver yourself
[2:33:07] who delivered you
[2:33:09] somebody
[2:33:12] what happened when somebody put pressure
[2:33:14] on you
[2:33:17] take no thought
[2:33:19] how and what you shall speak
[2:33:23] for it shall be given to you
[2:33:26] in that same hour what you shall want
[2:33:33] when you go to trial
[2:33:37] when you go to pressure
[2:33:40] when people begin to oppress you
[2:33:43] or to attack you
[2:33:46] are you there
[2:33:48] god also approaches
[2:33:52] do you follow me
[2:33:53] you need to learn
[2:33:54] [Applause]
[2:33:56] to relax in trouble
[2:34:00] are you there
[2:34:01] when the enemy comes like a flood
[2:34:05] the water
[2:34:07] the spirit of the lord
[2:34:10] so when somebody is attacking you god
[2:34:13] also is preparing himself
[2:34:17] do you follow me
[2:34:18] the problem is
[2:34:20] when we go through trial we get ourself
[2:34:23] in it
[2:34:26] then when god speaks we don't catch him
[2:34:30] are you there
[2:34:31] god is saying
[2:34:33] when you see a battle
[2:34:34] stand quiet
[2:34:37] are you there
[2:34:38] when you stand quiet
[2:34:40] you're gonna hear his instruction

[2:35:14] that bullet is specific for what you're
[2:35:17] going through

[2:52:20] for your love and for your mercy
[2:52:22] and for everything you have been doing
[2:52:24] for us
[2:52:26] father you opened the doors
[2:52:29] yourself
[2:52:30] where man was completely forbidden
[2:52:33] to enter into the presence of the lord
[2:52:36] father you put a flaming sword
[2:52:39] you block it with the caribbeans
[2:52:42] but you never stopped there because you
[2:52:44] knew there was a true atonement that was
[2:52:47] coming to take over lord
[2:52:49] father the burden that was on man
[2:52:52] lord you came down
[2:52:54] and you climbed the same hill
[2:52:56] that adam clam
[2:52:59] adam climbed onto that wheel hill
[2:53:01] and was buried lord
[2:53:04] but you came
[2:53:05] as our representation
[2:53:07] and you took our sins father you pay the
[2:53:11] debt
[2:53:11] and you open the way so that we can go
[2:53:14] back again to the presence of the lord
[2:53:17] father man
[2:53:19] everything that he does in his own eyes
[2:53:22] looks good
[2:53:23] but you came to give us a true and a
[2:53:26] perfect example
[2:53:27] of a lamb who is constantly depending on
[2:53:30] the dove
[2:53:32] father you never started even your
[2:53:34] ministry until the dolph came
[2:53:36] you waited for the dove to come and to
[2:53:39] lead you and that same dove led you all
[2:53:43] the way to calvary and that same dove
[2:53:46] came and pulled you out of the grave
[2:53:48] father lord jesus christ you are
[2:53:50] speaking to your children
[2:53:52] that now
[2:53:53] you are restoring back
[2:53:55] that power of the spoken word
[2:53:58] and father
[2:53:59] many times we have lived our own life
[2:54:02] resolving things by our own thinking our
[2:54:06] own reasoning our own abilities
[2:54:10] but lord you training your children
[2:54:12] because the hour is getting very tight
[2:54:16] you only take the squeeze lord
[2:54:18] father to pull out completely
[2:54:21] that third pull into its completeness
[2:54:24] lord and father you are training us lord
[2:54:27] father to begin to take our hands off
[2:54:29] the steering wheel
[2:54:31] off lord further our lives
[2:54:33] and to begin lord to relax
[2:54:35] and to understand that you never leave
[2:54:38] us
[2:54:39] nor even are you going to forsake us but
[2:54:42] you are always there to guide us and to
[2:54:44] lead us all the way until the end
[2:54:47] father may you help your children to
[2:54:49] realize lord that we are lambs
[2:54:52] because you are the lamb of god
[2:54:55] that we have been sent on this earth to
[2:54:58] depend unto the dwarf lord
[2:55:00] father your prophet even stated that the
[2:55:03] dove came the seventh dove came to lead
[2:55:06] the ego home lord and father that dove
[2:55:09] never stopped there but that dove is
[2:55:12] still with the brother and that dove is
[2:55:15] here to lead us and to guide us in every
[2:55:18] detail in our lives lord father may you
[2:55:20] help us relax
[2:55:22] may you help us lord father to begin
[2:55:25] lord to yield more and more to the holy
[2:55:27] spirit so that we can begin to receive
[2:55:30] instruction that can make our life
[2:55:33] successful that can make our our
[2:55:35] marriage successful that can make our
[2:55:38] career our businesses everything that we
[2:55:40] do successful lord and may we learn how
[2:55:44] to speak the right thing at the right
[2:55:47] moment under the right inspiration and
[2:55:49] the right anointing of the holy spirit
[2:55:52] and at that point it's not gonna be us
[2:55:54] speaking but it's gonna be the holy
[2:55:56] spirit talking and the holy spirit
[2:55:58] resolving the holy spirit healing the
[2:56:01] holy spirit doing everything and we're
[2:56:04] just gonna be as much as a servant as
[2:56:07] you were here when you were here on
[2:56:08] earth lord because your prophet told us
[2:56:11] lord that in the age of laodicea the age
[2:56:14] is no cold it is not even heart lord and
[2:56:18] because of that lukewarm situation lord
[2:56:21] father you spew them out of your mouth
[2:56:23] and your prophet explained to us that
[2:56:25] spewing them out of your mouth it means
[2:56:28] that they were no longer your mouth
[2:56:30] peace because now you're taking the
[2:56:32] bread to be your mouth's priest to speak
[2:56:36] again to prophesy again the second time
[2:56:39] father that's why you gave instruction
[2:56:41] not only to take the book but to take
[2:56:44] the book and eat it so that we can be
[2:56:47] one with the book and when we speak lord
[2:56:50] we will be speaking the word of eternal
[2:56:52] life that can bring peace to our family
[2:56:55] peace to our children peace to our
[2:56:58] people peace well father to our worker
[2:57:01] peace to everywhere we going lord and
[2:57:03] that can handle every single situation
[2:57:06] no matter what the devil is going to
[2:57:08] bring in our life father we thank you
[2:57:10] for giving us this time and this service
