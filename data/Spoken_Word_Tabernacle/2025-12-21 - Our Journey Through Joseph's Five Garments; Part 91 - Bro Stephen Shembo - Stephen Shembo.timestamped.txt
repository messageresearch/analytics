[49:15] and to take the church ages and you read
[49:17] yourself more detail than what we are
[49:20] giving to you. Then you will see for
[49:22] yourself the history, the background
[49:24] behind things and it help you understand
[49:26] things better. But if you are those
[49:28] Christian that only listen to the pastor
[49:30] and go home and mind their businesses,
[49:32] then you're going to get in trouble.
[49:34] Especially in the time like this when
[49:36] everybody can put anything on YouTube.
[49:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[49:42] &gt;&gt; You need to know for yourself. I'm going
[49:44] to put quote here, but you need to
[49:45] listen to the message yourself. Listen
[49:47] to the 70 weeks. Listen to the seal.
[49:50] Listen to adoption. And listen to the
[49:52] message of William Marion
[49:56] Brham. Amen.
[49:58] &gt;&gt; Lord's willing, not this uh sun uh this
[50:01] Wednesday, but the 31st is going to be
[50:04] not this coming, but the next one is
[50:07] going to be our New Year's Eve. And it's
[50:10] at 8:30. That's when we started. And we
[50:13] will have the Lord's Supper. It fell on
[50:15] Wednesday. So, we pick up the Wednesday
[50:17] all the way to uh Thursday. We will have
[50:20] preachers preach, preach, preach the way
[50:21] we normally do it. If you need a quote
[50:24] for it, you see me, I'll give you a
[50:25] quote. why I'm doing that. And then at
[50:27] the end, we have the Lord's supper and
[50:30] pray until we enter 2026 if the Lord
[50:33] carries. Amen.
[50:35] &gt;&gt; And then uh January the 17th, this is
[50:39] the first quarter of our question and
[50:41] answer, the venue is already booked. And
[50:44] January the 24th, which is the Saturday
[50:47] following the question and answer, I
[50:49] heard and I got a confirmation for the
[50:52] youngs man that when we will have a
[50:54] youngsman meeting. So question and
[50:56] answer. Put all your question in the
[50:58] box. Put them everything you have in
[51:00] mind whether it's good or bad. Just put
[51:02] it that return to courtship that return
[51:04] to engagement and marriage. Put it all
[51:07] together and let's sit and talk oneonone
[51:09] like we did with the young sister and
[51:11] make sure we got everything eye up and
[51:13] we are on the same page. Amen. So you

[51:18] sure you there.

[51:22] have question and answer and the second
[51:24] one I have you so I'm not going to be
[51:26] there and then we begin to use uh uh
[51:29] here excuses this one went to this this
[51:32] one uh the dog didn't want to eat and
[51:37] and the cat didn't want to smile and
[51:39] because the cat didn't smile we can't
[51:41] show up and all the excuses that come at
[51:45] the last minute so make sure you are
[51:48] there amen make sure you are there.
[51:51] Amen.

[51:57] &gt;&gt; in this church.
[52:01] &gt;&gt; You can do your you can go with for your
[52:04] exercise
[52:05] &gt;&gt; and you dress a certain way with pants
[52:07] and everything. You can shoot the ball

[52:25] wrong with it. Amen.
[52:27] &gt;&gt; But not for competition and begin to
[52:30] think about going to NFL going to NBA
[52:34] then become millionaire then give mommy
[52:36] and daddy your money. Most of the time
[52:38] the problem start from the parent
[52:41] &gt;&gt; because the delinquency is coming from
[52:43] the parent.
[52:44] &gt;&gt; The parent are looking for money so
[52:46] quick. So they're pushing the children
[52:47] towards sport sport sport and before you
[52:50] know it you find believer in this
[52:52] message with children that are
[52:54] progressing in NFL
[52:57] &gt;&gt; where they are women there are all type
[52:59] of stuff going on. Don't don't don't say

[53:21] &gt;&gt; God can bless you many ways, but you
[53:24] don't get to get into that sport arena,
[53:27] NCAA, and all this kind of stuff because
[53:30] it's going to put you in an environment
[53:32] of women, crazy beer, and crazy songs
[53:36] and everything, and you will be
[53:38] worshiping the devil.
[53:40] &gt;&gt; I already gave you the quote in this

[58:19] complaining. God have done so much step
[58:21] by step. The same God that is doing will
[58:25] continue to do. Amen. So stay in prayer.
[58:29] Continue to pray. He's rich in money.

[58:38] rich in material. And he will provide
[58:40] everything every step of the time. So
[58:43] pray. Do what you can do. And we will
[58:45] continue to move on by the grace of God.
[58:47] Amen.
[58:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. I got a daddy a baby dedication
[58:51] that was given to me this morning.
[58:53] That's why I had to uh search for the
[58:55] slide. Thank God I found slide 126 had a
[59:01] baby dedication. Amen.
[59:03] &gt;&gt; So we will dedicate leader Noah Mopongo.
[59:07] Mama almost lost her life
[59:10] &gt;&gt; because of baby Noah. So Noah came right
[59:13] on time.
[59:14] &gt;&gt; So you can sing with me. Bring them in.
[59:17] And brother John is there. You can lead.
[59:20] Bring them in as brother John, brother
[59:22] Joel and sister Dy can bring the baby.
[59:25] And we will dedicate little Noah
[59:28] Mopolongo. My friend Noah. Welcome to
[59:30] spoken word. First time in prayer in the
[59:33] church. Welcome. [applause]
[59:40] Praise God. You can sing.
[59:45] Bring them in.
[59:49] Bring them in.
[59:52] Bring [singing] them little one to
[59:55] Jesus.
[59:59] &gt;&gt; I'm going to read the scripture and the
[1:00:02] quote that I usually read. Then we pray
[1:00:04] for the baby. The Bible says in the book
[1:00:06] of Luke 15:E1 16, "And they brought unto
[1:00:10] him also what
[1:00:13] &gt;&gt; little infant that he would touch them.
[1:00:16] But when his disciples saw it, they
[1:00:18] rebuked them. But Jesus called them unto
[1:00:21] him and say, suffer little children to
[1:00:24] come unto me and forbid them not, for of
[1:00:27] such is the kingdom of God." So baby
[1:00:30] dedication, it's scriptural. According
[1:00:33] to the message they talking in 1963 in
[1:00:36] uh September the 1st in the morning,
[1:00:39] brother Brandham say that you know when
[1:00:41] I see little fellows like that, he
[1:00:44] always take me back when I was a little
[1:00:46] boy and now the old saying is you know
[1:00:50] they on your feet now and your
[1:00:53] heart later but I don't believe it shall
[1:00:56] be so when we dedicate them to the Lord.
[1:01:00] That's the reason why we give the
[1:01:02] children back to the Lord because he's
[1:01:05] the truly the children are in they they
[1:01:08] are an inheritance from the Lord. They
[1:01:10] are not even our children
[1:01:12] &gt;&gt; even though they look like us
[1:01:14] &gt;&gt; but they belong to God.
[1:01:16] &gt;&gt; Amen. So what we doing with a dedication
[1:01:19] we are taking what God gave it to us and
[1:01:21] say we don't know how to handle it.
[1:01:23] We're bringing that back to you again so
[1:01:26] that you handle it because whoever is in
[1:01:28] the hand of God, the devil cannot plag
[1:01:30] him up.
[1:01:31] &gt;&gt; That's why brother Brandham say when you
[1:01:33] dedicate them, he doesn't believe that
[1:01:35] they will trample on your heart later.
[1:01:37] Brother Brandham say we have a
[1:01:38] responsibility here and God placed this
[1:01:40] in your hand. He made a preacher out of
[1:01:43] you. I always say about women preachers,
[1:01:46] you know, but every mother, sister daddy
[1:01:48] is a preacher. Here is her congregation
[1:01:52] to raise these little fellows. Right.
[1:01:55] While daddy is sleeping,
[1:01:59] &gt;&gt; while daddy's doing what?
[1:02:01] &gt;&gt; H while daddy is working. And you got a
[1:02:05] responsibility. God bless you both. You
[1:02:08] got a fine little family. Brother Joe,
[1:02:12] you have a wonderful family and sister
[1:02:15] debt. Amen.
[1:02:16] &gt;&gt; My friend, welcome. It has been a while
[1:02:18] now. You look a little chubby, my
[1:02:21] friend. Welcome, brother Noah. Good to
[1:02:24] see you.

[1:02:28] Praise God. Amen. Okay, you can all pray

[1:03:42] rebuke any demonic spirit of sickness,
[1:03:45] any attack from the world of darkness,
[1:03:47] any accident, Lord, Father, around this
[1:03:50] child. Lord, we pray in the name of
[1:03:52] Jesus Christ that you protect him. May

[1:04:06] hold of this baby and protect him, Lord.

[1:06:06] &gt;&gt; When you go, Amen. Amen. I don't know
[1:06:08] what happened to you. Forget about it.
[1:06:10] In good time and bad,
[1:06:12] &gt;&gt; you heard it.
[1:06:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:16] So, forget about the bad time now. Let's
[1:06:19] look at the good time. Amen.
[1:06:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:06:21] &gt;&gt; Let's pray. Heavenly Father, Lord, we
[1:06:23] are approaching you humbly this morning.
[1:06:26] Father, thanking you for your grace,
[1:06:27] your love, your mercy, and for
[1:06:29] everything you have been doing for us.
[1:06:31] Father, this is as far as I can go with
[1:06:34] the ability you have given me, Lord. But
[1:06:36] when it comes to ministering to your
[1:06:38] children, I'm completely unable. Father,
[1:06:41] it takes the supernatural action of the
[1:06:43] Holy Spirit to move me and the
[1:06:45] congregation away so you can come and
[1:06:48] minister and bless and feel and heal and
[1:06:50] be everything and all for everybody,
[1:06:53] Lord. Father, Lord Jesus Christ, come
[1:06:55] down in the power of resurrection. Speak
[1:06:58] to our soul Lord. We rebuke the devil
[1:07:00] away from this place and thank you as we
[1:07:03] commit it all in the name of Jesus
[1:07:05] Christ. Amen.
[1:07:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:09] &gt;&gt; Let's go to the book of Exodus chapter
[1:07:12] 34.
[1:07:15] If you do good, we will get to this
[1:07:17] parable.
[1:07:19] But you got the background pretty good.
[1:07:22] Amen. Amen.
[1:07:24] &gt;&gt; If you have a problem with sport, go
[1:07:26] listen to the sermon that I gave you the
[1:07:28] quote.

[1:07:34] &gt;&gt; No sir.
[1:07:38] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:07:39] &gt;&gt; We don't believe in that.

[1:09:58] think? She says ask mom, I know the
[1:10:01] inspection fair [laughter]
[1:10:05] because both of them synchronize
[1:10:07] together. If one say yes, I go to the
[1:10:09] other one. Yes, correct me. And and and
[1:10:12] one was in another room and another one
[1:10:14] was in another room. And if one say
[1:10:16] check mom, I say inspection is already
[1:10:18] fair. Just take it completely and then
[1:10:21] move and get another thing. Amen.
[1:10:24] [laughter]
[1:10:25] Uh they will get me after service.
[1:10:28] Anyway, I got the deacon. Okay. Uh
[1:10:30] Exodus 34.
[1:10:36] Exodus 34. It's good when we do things
[1:10:39] like that, it loosen you up because
[1:10:41] something is coming.
[1:10:43] &gt;&gt; Exodus 34 verse one. If you dare, you
[1:10:47] can say amen. Amen. Now you understand
[1:10:49] the background clearly of Exodus. You
[1:10:52] understand what's happening here? So I'm
[1:10:54] going to touch up quickly. We move.
[1:10:55] Amen.
[1:10:56] &gt;&gt; Verse one. And the Lord said to Moses,
[1:10:59] "Do what?
[1:11:00] &gt;&gt; Do thee two tables of stone."
[1:11:02] &gt;&gt; We understand this clearly now.
[1:11:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. like unto the first you might be
[1:11:06] seated and I will write upon this table
[1:11:10] the word that were in the first table
[1:11:13] which you broke. So clearly this is the
[1:11:16] first table. Everybody's clear.
[1:11:19] &gt;&gt; And remember this one Moses is going to
[1:11:21] you the table. He's taking two stone. He
[1:11:24] moving with the stone but nothing is
[1:11:26] written in the stone.
[1:11:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:29] &gt;&gt; We took it all the way to our days.
[1:11:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:31] &gt;&gt; We clear so far?
[1:11:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. So there is stone and nothing is
[1:11:35] written there.
[1:11:36] &gt;&gt; The first stone everything was written
[1:11:38] there and he was broken.
[1:11:40] &gt;&gt; He stayed there 40 days and 40 night and
[1:11:42] brother Brandham say he was fasting
[1:11:45] &gt;&gt; just like Jesus was fasting
[1:11:47] &gt;&gt; because Moses was a type of Christ.
[1:11:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. So Moses is going to the
[1:11:55] mountain with something that look like
[1:11:57] this.
[1:11:59] But there is nothing written there.
[1:12:01] &gt;&gt; And God have to give the interpretation
[1:12:04] of the unwritten stone.
[1:12:08] &gt;&gt; We are together.
[1:12:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. The interpretation
[1:12:14] &gt;&gt; of the unwritten
[1:12:20] &gt;&gt; unwritten word.
[1:12:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:25] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Verse uh two. And be ready
[1:12:31] in the morning and come up in the
[1:12:33] morning to Monsana which is called also
[1:12:37] Hore. We went through this
[1:12:39] &gt;&gt; and present yourself there to me in the
[1:12:42] top of the mountain. So it cannot be
[1:12:45] done below the mountain.
[1:12:47] &gt;&gt; You have to climb high
[1:12:51] &gt;&gt; on the top of the mountain.
[1:12:54] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:12:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; To God.
[1:12:57] &gt;&gt; We talking about a mountain. You come
[1:12:59] all the way in this way
[1:13:02] &gt;&gt; because somebody come on top of the
[1:13:04] mountain.
[1:13:05] &gt;&gt; Not under the mountain. on top of the
[1:13:07] mountain.
[1:13:08] &gt;&gt; We clear my friend?
[1:13:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:09] &gt;&gt; We clear?
[1:13:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:11] &gt;&gt; Job 2:5.
[1:13:13] [clears throat]
[1:13:14] And the Lord descended in a cloud.
[1:13:19] [laughter]
[1:13:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:21] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:13:22] &gt;&gt; We got a mountain.
[1:13:26] &gt;&gt; And what came out there?
[1:13:29] &gt;&gt; So, the cloud comes with God.
[1:13:32] When the cloud is coming,
[1:13:35] &gt;&gt; God is in the cloud. [screaming]
[1:13:40] &gt;&gt; This is the Bible.
[1:13:42] &gt;&gt; I have not even say brother Brandham
[1:13:44] said.
[1:13:45] &gt;&gt; I'm reading the Bible.
[1:13:48] &gt;&gt; The Bible and the message I have one.
[1:13:52] &gt;&gt; We clear.
[1:13:54] &gt;&gt; So God comes in the cloud.
[1:13:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; So the cloud is not SOMETHING NEW.
[1:14:05] LORD,
[1:14:06] &gt;&gt; THAT cloud was given to us for
[1:14:08] reference.
[1:14:10] &gt;&gt; Because God is the same yesterday,
[1:14:13] &gt;&gt; today, and forever.
[1:14:15] &gt;&gt; If he was yesterday in the cloud today,
[1:14:17] he must come how?
[1:14:18] &gt;&gt; In a cloud.
[1:14:22] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:14:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:24] &gt;&gt; I'm happy when you're moving like this.
[1:14:26] So, we moving pretty good. We clear.
[1:14:28] &gt;&gt; Amen. And the Lord descended in the
[1:14:30] cloud and stood with him water.
[1:14:33] &gt;&gt; There
[1:14:33] &gt;&gt; God was standing.
[1:14:38] &gt;&gt; I didn't see this at home. I just saw it
[1:14:40] now.
[1:14:41] &gt;&gt; God was standing.
[1:14:44] &gt;&gt; Standing in the cloud.
[1:14:46] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:14:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:14:50] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:14:54] &gt;&gt; Brother Robert, I want to hear amen from
[1:14:56] that corner.
[1:14:58] Amen. Ah,
[1:15:00] &gt;&gt; are we together?
[1:15:01] &gt;&gt; God was standing.
[1:15:06] &gt;&gt; So if you look at God,
[1:15:08] &gt;&gt; I'm just picking up an example.
[1:15:10] &gt;&gt; God was standing.
[1:15:14] &gt;&gt; And do you know that when he descended,
[1:15:16] there was something in the hand of God.
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; Do you know that?
[1:15:24] &gt;&gt; He descended with a law. It's written in
[1:15:26] the Bible
[1:15:27] &gt;&gt; that God when he descended on Sana, he
[1:15:30] was coming with a law.
[1:15:34] &gt;&gt; You don't know that.
[1:15:36] &gt;&gt; Ah, you already know. Let's move on. If
[1:15:38] you don't know it, see me after church.
[1:15:40] Are we together?
[1:15:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; And the Lord stood there with the
[1:15:44] [laughter]
[1:15:45] with him there and proclaimed the name
[1:15:48] of the Lord.
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; This this this paso Pentecostus,
[1:15:52] &gt;&gt; the Lord is proclaiming the name of the
[1:15:54] Lord.
[1:15:57] &gt;&gt; [laughter]
[1:15:58] &gt;&gt; Job to verse 28 so we don't get lost
[1:16:00] because if you touch those it suck you
[1:16:02] to some different channel to verse 28
[1:16:05] and he was there with the Lord how many
[1:16:07] days
[1:16:09] &gt;&gt; 40 days and what
[1:16:10] &gt;&gt; and 40 nights
[1:16:11] &gt;&gt; and he did neither eat bread nor drink
[1:16:13] water
[1:16:14] &gt;&gt; water
[1:16:14] &gt;&gt; it's a it was a rep it was a prefigure a
[1:16:18] tap of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:16:20] &gt;&gt; and he wrote let me leave it I can't let
[1:16:22] me read it and he wrote upon the tables,
[1:16:25] the word of the covenant, the ten
[1:16:27] commandment. Are we together?
[1:16:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:16:30] &gt;&gt; And it came to pass when Moses came from
[1:16:33] Mount Sana with the two tables of the
[1:16:36] test of testimony in Moses uh in uh in
[1:16:40] Moses hand when he came down
[1:16:44] from [clears throat]
[1:16:46] the mount that Moses knew not that he
[1:16:50] that the skin of his face did what?
[1:16:53] shown while he talked with him.
[1:16:55] &gt;&gt; So when Moses was coming down, Moses
[1:16:59] when Moses was coming down,
[1:17:01] &gt;&gt; go back to uh to the beginning and it
[1:17:03] came to pass when Moses came down from
[1:17:07] Mount Sana with the two table of the of
[1:17:10] testimony in Moses what?
[1:17:14] &gt;&gt; So how many handh held the testimony?
[1:17:19] &gt;&gt; Can you read please with me? If you do
[1:17:21] like this, this sermon will go next
[1:17:23] Sunday. How many hand?
[1:17:25] &gt;&gt; One.
[1:17:26] &gt;&gt; One hand.
[1:17:27] &gt;&gt; So Moses was coming up with uh
[1:17:30] &gt;&gt; with two tables in one hand.
[1:17:34] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:17:36] &gt;&gt; So a prophet
[1:17:39] &gt;&gt; holding two tables not with two hands
[1:17:43] &gt;&gt; with one hand.
[1:17:45] &gt;&gt; I assume he was the right hand.
[1:17:47] &gt;&gt; Yes. Because brother Brandham said the
[1:17:49] majority of men and most of men were
[1:17:50] right-handed.
[1:17:51] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:17:53] &gt;&gt; So he had the table of the law on right
[1:17:55] hand.
[1:17:56] &gt;&gt; Verse uh 29. Amen.
[1:17:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:00] &gt;&gt; And as he was descending that Moses knew
[1:18:02] not
[1:18:03] &gt;&gt; that the skin of what
[1:18:05] &gt;&gt; his face
[1:18:06] &gt;&gt; did what?
[1:18:07] &gt;&gt; Shown.
[1:18:08] &gt;&gt; What? What?
[1:18:09] &gt;&gt; He talked with him.
[1:18:10] &gt;&gt; So when he was coming down his face was
[1:18:13] shining.
[1:18:14] &gt;&gt; So he was a human being. with a face
[1:18:18] shining
[1:18:19] &gt;&gt; and a book in the hand.
[1:18:27] &gt;&gt; Are you lost?
[1:18:29] &gt;&gt; A human being,
[1:18:31] &gt;&gt; a human being.
[1:18:33] &gt;&gt; So if Moses stand like this, you will
[1:18:36] see a human being
[1:18:37] &gt;&gt; with a face shining
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; and a book in the hand
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; and the book the book that he had in the
[1:18:44] hand.
[1:18:45] &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes sir.
[1:18:46] &gt;&gt; Was the stone with the interpretation.
[1:18:51] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:18:52] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:18:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:53] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:18:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:18:55] &gt;&gt; Remember this was not the first table.
[1:19:00] &gt;&gt; Follow me carefully my friend.
[1:19:03] &gt;&gt; When Moses went and pick up the first
[1:19:05] table, his face never
[1:19:07] &gt;&gt; shine.
[1:19:12] &gt;&gt; Are we together? The face of Moses shine
[1:19:15] with the second table.
[1:19:17] &gt;&gt; Not the first one.
[1:19:19] &gt;&gt; The first one he came down. Nobody say
[1:19:21] that his face was shining.
[1:19:23] &gt;&gt; He took the table and broke it.
[1:19:25] &gt;&gt; But when he went with the stone
[1:19:29] &gt;&gt; that was not written.
[1:19:31] &gt;&gt; And God put the ring on the stone. WHEN
[1:19:35] MOSES CAME THAT SECOND time
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; with the stone interpreted
[1:19:41] SIR
[1:19:41] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE INTERPRETATION were the
[1:19:43] thunders
[1:19:49] &gt;&gt; we need to go back again on next
[1:19:51] understanding because when God spoke it
[1:19:53] was what
[1:19:54] &gt;&gt; so it was the interpretation of the
[1:19:57] thunders
[1:19:59] &gt;&gt; Israel heard boom
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; and God by boom he saying I am the Lord.
[1:20:06] &gt;&gt; So what was written on the stone was the
[1:20:10] interpretation or the meaning of the
[1:20:12] thunders.
[1:20:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:14] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:20:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:16] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:20:16] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:20:17] &gt;&gt; WHEN THE THUNDER WERE revealed
[1:20:20] &gt;&gt; upon a stone.
[1:20:22] &gt;&gt; Are we together? THE FACE of Moses begin
[1:20:25] to shine.
[1:20:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:33] So the interpretation
[1:20:39] &gt;&gt; of the thunders
[1:20:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:43] &gt;&gt; In the unwritten stone.
[1:20:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:48] &gt;&gt; In the unwritten stones
[1:20:51] &gt;&gt; brought the face to shine.
[1:20:57] Amen.
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; Glory to God. That was verse uh 29.
[1:21:03] Verse 30. And when Aaron and all the
[1:21:06] children of Israel saw Moses, behold the
[1:21:10] face of his king did what?
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; Shown.
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; And they were how?
[1:21:13] &gt;&gt; Afraid to come nigh him.
[1:21:15] &gt;&gt; Job to verse uh 33. So we save time. And
[1:21:19] till Moses has done what?
[1:21:21] &gt;&gt; Speaking with them,
[1:21:22] &gt;&gt; he did what? He put a veil on his face.
[1:21:24] &gt;&gt; So, Israel was afraid
[1:21:27] &gt;&gt; to look at Moses
[1:21:29] &gt;&gt; because it was not natural for a man
[1:21:31] face to shine like that.
[1:21:35] &gt;&gt; And because of fear, Moses ended up
[1:21:37] begin to put a veil
[1:21:40] &gt;&gt; upon his face.
[1:21:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:42] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:21:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:43] &gt;&gt; A veil was put upon the face of Moses,
[1:21:46] &gt;&gt; right?
[1:21:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:21:48] &gt;&gt; They put a veil. In the New Testament,
[1:21:50] it's written like this.
[1:21:51] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:21:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:21:53] &gt;&gt; The Bible says, "And until Moses has
[1:21:55] done speaking with them, he put a veil
[1:21:58] on his face. But when Moses went in
[1:22:02] before the Lord to speak with him with
[1:22:04] the Lord, he took off the fa the veil of
[1:22:07] the faith. The veil of remember he was a
[1:22:10] battery.
[1:22:11] &gt;&gt; He's going to be charged."
[1:22:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:16] &gt;&gt; And until he came out. So when God was
[1:22:19] talking to Moses, Moses and God were
[1:22:21] seeing face to
[1:22:22] &gt;&gt; face.
[1:22:25] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:22:27] &gt;&gt; Normally God was supposed to talk to
[1:22:31] Israel
[1:22:32] &gt;&gt; face to face.
[1:22:36] &gt;&gt; I hope we together.
[1:22:38] &gt;&gt; Israel refuse and put a mediator.
[1:22:42] &gt;&gt; Now the mediator is the only one who
[1:22:45] sees God.
[1:22:46] In other words, he sucked God.
[1:22:49] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:22:50] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:22:53] &gt;&gt; In other words, Moses was taking God
[1:22:57] &gt;&gt; into a capacity that a human being can
[1:23:00] handle.
[1:23:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:23:08] &gt;&gt; If you go to Duke Power and you use your
[1:23:11] computer to the generator,
[1:23:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. Your computer will be burned
[1:23:17] &gt;&gt; because the intensity is too strong.
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; But in your home, they use a converter
[1:23:23] &gt;&gt; that take the intensity and bring it to
[1:23:26] the level THAT YOU CAN MANAGE
[1:23:30] &gt;&gt; AND YOU CAN HOOK YOUR COMPUTER and be
[1:23:33] able to use electricity. SO MOSES WAS
[1:23:36] ABLE TO WITHSTAND GOD.
[1:23:39] &gt;&gt; He was at a LEVEL TO STAND and watch
[1:23:41] God.
[1:23:43] AND HE WATCHED GOD SO MUCH UNTIL THE
[1:23:45] IMPACT OF GOD ENTERED MOSES.
[1:23:48] &gt;&gt; AND BROTHER BRHAM TO BE PRECISE HE SAID
[1:23:51] THE PILLAR OF FIRE WAS IN MOSES.
[1:23:56] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:23:57] &gt;&gt; Are we together? SO WHEN MOSES TURNED
[1:24:00] AROUND AND GO TO THE CONGREGATION, HE
[1:24:03] WAS ALREADY a converter.
[1:24:05] &gt;&gt; NOW THE CONGREGATION CAN MANAGE GOD IN
[1:24:09] HUMAN FLESH.
[1:24:11] BROTHER,
[1:24:15] &gt;&gt; are we together?
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:17] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:18] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:24:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:22] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:24:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:23] &gt;&gt; SO WHEN HE GOES TO THE MOUNTAIN, HE
[1:24:25] REMOVE everything
[1:24:26] &gt;&gt; and he talk to God. When he finish, he
[1:24:29] get charged, he go back. That's what the
[1:24:30] Bible is saying here
[1:24:32] &gt;&gt; in verse 34. But when Moses went in
[1:24:35] before who?
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; The Lord.
[1:24:36] &gt;&gt; To do what?
[1:24:37] &gt;&gt; To speak with him.
[1:24:38] &gt;&gt; Uh-huh. Don't let the devil trouble you,
[1:24:40] my friend.
[1:24:41] &gt;&gt; Forget about what is outside. Let's stay
[1:24:43] focused.
[1:24:45] &gt;&gt; Because it's very easy for you to get
[1:24:46] lost.
[1:24:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:24:48] &gt;&gt; Uh-huh. The Bible say, "But when Moses
[1:24:50] went in before the Lord to speak with
[1:24:52] him, he took the veil off until he came
[1:24:54] out. He came out and spoke to the
[1:24:56] children of Israel that which he was
[1:24:59] what?
[1:24:59] &gt;&gt; Commanded."
[1:25:00] &gt;&gt; Verse 35. And the children of Israel saw
[1:25:03] the face of who?
[1:25:04] &gt;&gt; Moses.
[1:25:05] &gt;&gt; Not the face of God.
[1:25:06] &gt;&gt; Right. Amen.
[1:25:07] &gt;&gt; Right.
[1:25:10] They were seeing God
[1:25:12] &gt;&gt; in the face of Moses
[1:25:15] &gt;&gt; through Moses.
[1:25:18] &gt;&gt; The glory that they could not see. Moses
[1:25:21] was reflecting it.
[1:25:24] &gt;&gt; We together.
[1:25:25] &gt;&gt; And the children of Israel saw the face
[1:25:28] of who?
[1:25:29] &gt;&gt; Moses.
[1:25:29] &gt;&gt; That the skin of Moses face did what?
[1:25:32] &gt;&gt; Shown. And Moses put the veil upon his
[1:25:34] face again until he went in to speak
[1:25:37] with what?
[1:25:39] &gt;&gt; With the Lord. Are we together?
[1:25:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:41] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:25:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:42] &gt;&gt; REMEMBER MOSES FACE shine
[1:25:45] &gt;&gt; and his experience happened on top of
[1:25:47] the mountain
[1:25:48] &gt;&gt; with a cloud.
[1:25:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. When God came down with a cloud on
[1:25:54] top of the mountain.
[1:25:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:57] &gt;&gt; Somebody's face shine.
[1:25:59] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:26:01] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:26:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:26:04] &gt;&gt; In the book of uh
[1:26:07] Matthew [clears throat]
[1:26:09] &gt;&gt; chapter 17,
[1:26:11] &gt;&gt; we together.
[1:26:12] &gt;&gt; THE BIBLE SAY AFTER HOW MANY DAYS?
[1:26:15] &gt;&gt; Six days.
[1:26:16] &gt;&gt; So which day was it?
[1:26:17] &gt;&gt; Six days.
[1:26:21] &gt;&gt; I didn't write the Bible.
[1:26:24] &gt;&gt; After how many days?
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; Six days.
[1:26:26] &gt;&gt; So which day are we in?
[1:26:27] &gt;&gt; The seventh day. SO WHY DID HE ONLY
[1:26:30] HAPPEN IN THE SEVENTH DAY?
[1:26:33] &gt;&gt; GLORY, GLORY, GLORY.
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; AND TO BE PRECISE,
[1:26:40] &gt;&gt; when you go to the book of Luke,
[1:26:42] &gt;&gt; LUKE SAY IT WAS ABOUT THE EIGHTH DAY.
[1:26:48] &gt;&gt; It was NOT THE EIGHTH DAY.
[1:26:50] &gt;&gt; YOU DON'T KNOW THAT.
[1:26:52] &gt;&gt; YOU DON'T KNOW THAT.
[1:26:55] AMEN.
[1:27:04] &gt;&gt; If we preach what we have to preach next
[1:27:06] week, it's not a problem. Amen.
[1:27:14] Amen.
[1:27:25] &gt;&gt; Don't worry my friend because I don't
[1:27:27] want you say brother uh
[1:27:31] uh uh Stephen say
[1:27:38] &gt;&gt; let's go to Luke 9. Keep your finger
[1:27:40] there.
[1:27:41] &gt;&gt; Yeah, let's go to Luke 9. There's no
[1:27:42] problem.
[1:27:44] We already finished with uh 34. Let's go
[1:27:47] to Luke 9.
[1:27:51] Sometime it looks like I'm reading a
[1:27:53] different Bible. Let's go to Luke 9
[1:27:56] &gt;&gt; verse 28. The same story of m
[1:27:59] transfiguration.
[1:28:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:01] &gt;&gt; Luke 9. If you there, you can say amen.
[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:04] &gt;&gt; Luke 9. Let's go to uh uh verse 28.
[1:28:10] &gt;&gt; 28.
[1:28:11] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. Luke 9:28.
[1:28:18] [laughter]
[1:28:19] &gt;&gt; I didn't say that. He came from the
[1:28:21] congregation.
[1:28:22] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:28:24] &gt;&gt; Luke 9:28. Take 28.
[1:28:27] &gt;&gt; If you there, you can say amen.
[1:28:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:29] &gt;&gt; And it came TO PASS A BATH water
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; in 8 days.
[1:28:32] &gt;&gt; Let's go quick. Let's go clear
[1:28:35] &gt;&gt; in in Matthew. Matthew say it was what?
[1:28:38] &gt;&gt; After six days.
[1:28:39] &gt;&gt; After six days. So we have six,
[1:28:42] &gt;&gt; we have seven,
[1:28:44] &gt;&gt; and we have eight.
[1:28:46] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:28:48] &gt;&gt; Six have morning to evening.
[1:28:50] &gt;&gt; We got morning
[1:28:52] &gt;&gt; and evening.
[1:28:53] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; The morning and the evening was the
[1:28:56] first day. The morning in the book of
[1:28:58] Genesis, the morning and the evening.
[1:29:00] The morning and the evening. Have I said
[1:29:02] something wrong?
[1:29:02] &gt;&gt; No.
[1:29:03] &gt;&gt; Tuesday was h the seventh day was
[1:29:06] morning and what?
[1:29:07] &gt;&gt; And evening.
[1:29:07] &gt;&gt; And the eighth day was what? Morning
[1:29:10] &gt;&gt; and what
[1:29:10] &gt;&gt; and evening.
[1:29:11] &gt;&gt; So Luke ma Matthew say it was which day?
[1:29:14] &gt;&gt; After six days.
[1:29:16] &gt;&gt; So we crossed the sixth day.
[1:29:17] &gt;&gt; So where were we at?
[1:29:18] &gt;&gt; Seventh day.
[1:29:19] &gt;&gt; So we are clearly in the seventh day.
[1:29:21] Now Luke is saying what?
[1:29:23] &gt;&gt; About an eighth day.
[1:29:24] &gt;&gt; We are not in the eighth day.
[1:29:28] &gt;&gt; Are we together? We are not in the
[1:29:30] eighth day.
[1:29:31] &gt;&gt; We are about.
[1:29:33] &gt;&gt; So we are not in the eighth day. We are
[1:29:36] about in the seventh day. If it's A
[1:29:38] BATH, IT CANNOT be in the morning.
[1:29:45] &gt;&gt; Sister Sharon, YOU GOT IT.
[1:29:47] &gt;&gt; IT HAVE TO BE TOWARD THE EVENING
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; WHEN THE TIME IS A LITTLE BIT LIKE DAY
[1:29:54] and night.
[1:30:01] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; THIS MESSAGE IS PERFECTLY IN LINE WITH
[1:30:06] THE SCRIPTURE.
[1:30:08] Are we together?
[1:30:09] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:30:09] &gt;&gt; SO IT HAPPENED IN THE EVENING TIME.
[1:30:12] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:30:13] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:30:15] &gt;&gt; We clear now.
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; We clear now.
[1:30:17] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; SO JESUS WENT ON TRANSFIGURATION IN THE
[1:30:21] EVENING TIME.
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:30:23] &gt;&gt; AND HE DIDN'T GO UNDER. HE WENT ON TOP
[1:30:26] OF THE MOUNTAIN.
[1:30:26] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:30:27] &gt;&gt; HE CLIMBED THE MOUNTAIN.
[1:30:29] &gt;&gt; And the Bible says right here after six
[1:30:32] day JESUS TOOK WHO?
[1:30:33] &gt;&gt; PETER.
[1:30:34] &gt;&gt; And who?
[1:30:34] &gt;&gt; James.
[1:30:35] &gt;&gt; And who? and John his BROTHER
[1:30:37] &gt;&gt; AND BRING THEM UP INTO A WHAT?
[1:30:39] &gt;&gt; IN HIGH MOUNTAIN APART,
[1:30:41] &gt;&gt; A HIGH MOUNTAIN
[1:30:44] &gt;&gt; APART.
[1:30:45] &gt;&gt; AND WHAT HAPPENED OVER THERE? THE BIBLE
[1:30:47] SAYS, where are we at in uh in uh in uh
[1:30:52] &gt;&gt; Luke?
[1:30:53] &gt;&gt; In in uh in Luke over there, you know
[1:30:55] the cloud came.
[1:30:57] &gt;&gt; Do you know that on transfiguration the
[1:30:59] cloud came?
[1:31:00] &gt;&gt; You want to see that or we clear?
[1:31:02] &gt;&gt; The cloud came, right? And the Bible
[1:31:05] says that when he was and and and in the
[1:31:08] high mountain verse two and was what?
[1:31:10] &gt;&gt; Transfigured before them.
[1:31:12] &gt;&gt; He was transfigured before them. In
[1:31:14] other words, Jesus changed.
[1:31:19] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:31:19] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:31:20] &gt;&gt; WE NEED TO KNOW THE CHANGES of Jesus.
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:31:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:25] &gt;&gt; He changed. HE WAS TRANSFIGURED before
[1:31:27] them. AND WHAT HAPPENED TO HIS FACE?
[1:31:30] &gt;&gt; His face did shine.
[1:31:32] Can you read with me?
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; WHAT HAPPENED TO HIS FACE?
[1:31:35] &gt;&gt; His face did shine.
[1:31:37] &gt;&gt; HIS FACE DID SHINE AS WHAT?
[1:31:39] &gt;&gt; THE SUN.
[1:31:40] &gt;&gt; SO THE FACE OF JESUS IN THE mountain
[1:31:44] we [laughter]
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; SHOWN AS THE SUN.
[1:31:53] &gt;&gt; So on m on my transfiguration
[1:31:57] the face of Jesus.
[1:31:59] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN.
[1:32:00] &gt;&gt; SHINE AS WHAT?
[1:32:02] &gt;&gt; The sun.
[1:32:03] &gt;&gt; As the sun.
[1:32:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:06] &gt;&gt; And what else?
[1:32:07] &gt;&gt; His raignment was as white as
[1:32:09] &gt;&gt; And his remnant was what?
[1:32:11] &gt;&gt; White as the light.
[1:32:12] &gt;&gt; White as the light. Amen.
[1:32:14] &gt;&gt; If you notice, HE PICKED UP THREE
[1:32:16] PEOPLE.
[1:32:18] &gt;&gt; Three people
[1:32:19] &gt;&gt; to go with them.
[1:32:23] &gt;&gt; It's on the board.
[1:32:24] &gt;&gt; He picked up who?
[1:32:26] &gt;&gt; Peter, James, and John. Peter represent
[1:32:29] what?
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:32:36] &gt;&gt; And then he pick up who?
[1:32:37] &gt;&gt; James.
[1:32:38] &gt;&gt; James and what?
[1:32:39] &gt;&gt; John.
[1:32:41] &gt;&gt; The Bible is saying something.
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; John his brother.
[1:32:43] &gt;&gt; James and what?
[1:32:45] &gt;&gt; John his brother.
[1:32:46] &gt;&gt; The Bible didn't say John. James and
[1:32:48] John.
[1:32:49] &gt;&gt; He said James and John his brother.
[1:32:52] &gt;&gt; The Bible is reminding you that James
[1:32:54] and John.
[1:32:57] Yes sir.
[1:32:57] &gt;&gt; They were brothers.
[1:32:59] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:32:59] &gt;&gt; REMEMBER THEY WERE THE ONE THAT WANT TO
[1:33:01] CALL FIRE.
[1:33:07] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE IN THE MIND THEY WANT TO CALL
[1:33:09] FIRE LIKE WHO?
[1:33:12] &gt;&gt; Like who?
[1:33:12] &gt;&gt; ELIJAH.
[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; SO ELIJAH WAS IN THE MIND OF PETER OR OF
[1:33:16] JAMES AND JOHN.
[1:33:21] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:33:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:23] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:33:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:24] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:33:25] &gt;&gt; AMEN. SO THE BIBLE IS COMBINING JAMES
[1:33:27] AND JOHN.
[1:33:29] &gt;&gt; AND WE KNOW THAT.
[1:33:30] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:33:32] &gt;&gt; AND WE KNOW THAT JAMES AND JOHN,
[1:33:35] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:33:36] &gt;&gt; JESUS GAVE THEM a name.
[1:33:44] &gt;&gt; JESUS CALLED THEM BORES,
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; WHICH MEANS WHAT?
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; SONS OF THUNDER.
[1:33:50] &gt;&gt; THE THE SONS
[1:33:53] &gt;&gt; OF WHAT? THUNDER
[1:33:55] &gt;&gt; AND A THUNDER IS WHAT?
[1:33:59] &gt;&gt; SO WHAT WAS IN THE MOUNTAIN?
[1:34:02] &gt;&gt; THE SONS OF THUNDERS. THE FAITH OF THE
[1:34:06] SONS OF THUNDERS.
[1:34:13] &gt;&gt; I HOPE WE ARE TOGETHER.
[1:34:15] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:34:15] &gt;&gt; PETER AND JOHN WAS BIRTHED BY A TANDEM.
[1:34:19] &gt;&gt; THEY WERE THE SONS OF TANDE.
[1:34:21] &gt;&gt; THEY WERE BORN BY A TANDEM. IT TAKES A
[1:34:24] THUNDER TO GIVE BIRTH. YES, SIR.
[1:34:27] &gt;&gt; THEY WERE BORN [screaming] BY THE VOICE
[1:34:29] OF GOD. YES, SIR.
[1:34:32] &gt;&gt; THEY WERE BORN BY THE WORD OF GOD.
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; THE FAITH OF THE SONS OF STANDARDS.
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; SO WHEN YOU TAKE A MOUNTAIN AND A
[1:34:41] PROPHET LIKE UNTO MOSES WITH A CLOUD, HE
[1:34:46] RELEASES THE FAITH OF THE SONS OF
[1:34:49] THUNDERS.
[1:34:56] ARE WE TOGETHER?
[1:34:57] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:34:58] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[1:34:59] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:34:59] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:35:00] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:35:01] &gt;&gt; AND WHAT HAPPENED TO THE FACE OF JESUS
[1:35:02] CHRIST?
[1:35:05] &gt;&gt; WHAT HAPPENED TO THE FACE OF MOSES?
[1:35:08] &gt;&gt; My God.
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; Let's go to second Corinthian
[1:35:13] &gt;&gt; chapter 3. Glory. Glory.
[1:35:15] &gt;&gt; God.
[1:35:17] &gt;&gt; We just left the airport.
[1:35:18] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:35:19] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:35:20] &gt;&gt; Yeah. You might hear some noises. It's
[1:35:22] just we're breaking the sound. Okay.
[1:35:26] &gt;&gt; Let's go to 2 Corinthians chapter 3.
[1:35:29] &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God.
[1:35:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:36] &gt;&gt; We moving pretty good, my friend.
[1:35:39] &gt;&gt; I'm reading the Bible in for your
[1:35:41] information.
[1:35:46] &gt;&gt; 2 Corinthians chapter 3
[1:35:48] &gt;&gt; verse 7. If you dare, you can say amen.
[1:35:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:51] &gt;&gt; But if the ministration
[1:35:54] &gt;&gt; or the ministry of what
[1:35:56] &gt;&gt; death
[1:35:58] &gt;&gt; written engraved and engraved in water
[1:36:00] &gt;&gt; in stones
[1:36:01] &gt;&gt; WAS GLORIOUS.
[1:36:03] &gt;&gt; GLORIOUS.
[1:36:04] &gt;&gt; SO THAT THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL COULD NOT
[1:36:07] STAND FASTLY. IN OTHER WORDS, YOU CANNOT
[1:36:10] STAND too long
[1:36:12] &gt;&gt; watching Moses.
[1:36:15] when they see Moses, they go
[1:36:19] &gt;&gt; so they cannot intently
[1:36:21] &gt;&gt; sit there and keep watching Moses like
[1:36:23] wow
[1:36:25] when they see Moses
[1:36:28] Moses [laughter] are we together AND
[1:36:30] THEY COULD NOT STEADFASTLY BEHOLD the
[1:36:33] face of Moses
[1:36:35] &gt;&gt; for the what?
[1:36:36] &gt;&gt; Glory of HIS CONSENT.
[1:36:38] &gt;&gt; SO MOSES HAD A GLORY.
[1:36:42] &gt;&gt; Are we clear? Amen.
[1:36:44] &gt;&gt; He has a glory of his countenance which
[1:36:47] glory was to be WHAT
[1:36:49] &gt;&gt; DONE AWAY.
[1:36:50] &gt;&gt; HOW SHALL NOT THE MINISTRATION of what?
[1:36:53] &gt;&gt; The spirit
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; be rather than what water
[1:36:55] &gt;&gt; glory.
[1:36:56] &gt;&gt; IN OTHER WORDS, WHAT WAS COMING UP BY
[1:36:58] THE HOLY GHOST WAS EVEN MORE POWERFUL
[1:37:03] &gt;&gt; than Moses.
[1:37:04] &gt;&gt; AND THAT'S WHY WHEN YOU SEE CHRIST ON
[1:37:06] MOUNT TRANSFIGURATION, HIS FACE IS
[1:37:09] SHINING LIKE THE SUN.
[1:37:12] I HOPE WE ARE TOGETHER.
[1:37:14] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:37:15] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[1:37:16] &gt;&gt; WHAT CAME AFTER MOSES WAS EVEN POWERFUL.
[1:37:20] &gt;&gt; WE clear so far.
[1:37:21] &gt;&gt; We clear.
[1:37:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:22] &gt;&gt; Let's go to Revelation one.
[1:37:27] &gt;&gt; We're getting very close to finish our
[1:37:29] scripture.
[1:37:30] &gt;&gt; Let's go to Revelation one.
[1:37:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Emilation one. If you there,
[1:37:36] you can say amen.
[1:37:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:37] &gt;&gt; Verse 14. We there.
[1:37:39] &gt;&gt; Amen. We there
[1:37:41] &gt;&gt; you know John turned to see the voice
[1:37:44] &gt;&gt; of one that was walking in the midst of
[1:37:46] the candlestick.
[1:37:46] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:37:47] &gt;&gt; You know that right?
[1:37:48] &gt;&gt; And we want to know how does he look?
[1:37:52] &gt;&gt; We clear.
[1:37:53] &gt;&gt; The Bible says in verse 14 his head
[1:37:57] &gt;&gt; and his hair were what?
[1:38:00] &gt;&gt; White like wool.
[1:38:01] &gt;&gt; So if you look at the hair of that man
[1:38:04] it looks white
[1:38:06] &gt;&gt; like wool.
[1:38:07] &gt;&gt; That's right. And brother Brandham say
[1:38:09] it WAS A SYMBOL
[1:38:11] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE IN THE old English THE JUDGE
[1:38:14] THAT WAS on the court used to wear a wig
[1:38:18] &gt;&gt; a white wig
[1:38:20] sir
[1:38:20] &gt;&gt; we clear so far
[1:38:22] &gt;&gt; HE BECAUSE JESUS WAS NOT THAT old
[1:38:26] &gt;&gt; he was resurrected looking like that
[1:38:28] &gt;&gt; he didn't have white hair
[1:38:31] &gt;&gt; are we together
[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; AMEN
[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; THE BIBLE SAY THAT uh verse 14 his head
[1:38:35] and his hair were how
[1:38:37] &gt;&gt; white like wool,
[1:38:38] &gt;&gt; as white as what?
[1:38:40] &gt;&gt; As snow.
[1:38:40] &gt;&gt; And his eyes were as what?
[1:38:42] &gt;&gt; The flame of fire.
[1:38:43] &gt;&gt; And his feet LIKE TO THE FINE BRASS,
[1:38:47] which is judgment that he took from the
[1:38:49] church, as if they were burned in a
[1:38:51] furnace, and his voice as the sound of
[1:38:54] water,
[1:38:55] &gt;&gt; many waters.
[1:38:56] &gt;&gt; And he had in his right hand what?
[1:38:59] &gt;&gt; Seven stars.
[1:39:02] &gt;&gt; You know what he means? AND OUT OF HIS
[1:39:05] mouth went what? a sharp two-edged
[1:39:07] sword.
[1:39:08] &gt;&gt; And his countenance was as the water.
[1:39:11] &gt;&gt; The sun shineth in his strength.
[1:39:13] &gt;&gt; As the sun shine in his water,
[1:39:16] &gt;&gt; WE FOUND AGAIN CHRIST WITH SEVEN STARS
[1:39:20] &gt;&gt; which are seven angel
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; and seven messenger
[1:39:24] &gt;&gt; with a sword.
[1:39:28] &gt;&gt; The face look like the sun.
[1:39:31] &gt;&gt; Are we clear? Amen.
[1:39:32] &gt;&gt; Seven star with a sword coming from his
[1:39:35] mouth.
[1:39:36] &gt;&gt; And his face look like what?
[1:39:39] &gt;&gt; We clear so far.
[1:39:40] &gt;&gt; Let's finish in Revelation 10.
[1:39:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:45] &gt;&gt; Very easy, my friend.
[1:39:47] &gt;&gt; Revelation 10. If you dare, you can say
[1:39:49] amen.
[1:39:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. [laughter]
[1:39:51] &gt;&gt; Verse one. And I saw another mighty
[1:39:55] angel.
[1:39:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:57] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:39:57] &gt;&gt; COME DOWN FROM WHAT?
[1:39:59] &gt;&gt; HEAVEN.

[1:40:03] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[1:40:04] &gt;&gt; So we know who he is.
[1:40:06] &gt;&gt; The one that come in the cloud
[1:40:08] &gt;&gt; clothed with a cloud. And a rainbow
[1:40:10] covenant was upon his head
[1:40:13] &gt;&gt; and his face
[1:40:16] &gt;&gt; AGAIN
[1:40:18] &gt;&gt; WAS AS HE WERE THE WHAT?
[1:40:20] &gt;&gt; THE SUN.
[1:40:23] Face of Moses
[1:40:25] &gt;&gt; shining
[1:40:26] &gt;&gt; montas as the sun
[1:40:28] &gt;&gt; in the middle of the I mean seven
[1:40:30] goddess candlestick face is shining
[1:40:33] &gt;&gt; NOW IN REVELATION 10
[1:40:35] &gt;&gt; the angel THAT CAME HIS FACE IS SHINING
[1:40:39] &gt;&gt; HOW AS THE sun
[1:40:41] &gt;&gt; are we TOGETHER
[1:40:42] &gt;&gt; AMEN
[1:40:43] &gt;&gt; HIS FACE IS SHINING as he were the sun
[1:40:46] and his feet as what
[1:40:48] &gt;&gt; pillars of fire
[1:40:49] &gt;&gt; remember in revelation one his feet was
[1:40:52] like brass.
[1:40:56] &gt;&gt; BUT NOW HIS FEET HAVE CHANGED IN A
[1:40:58] PILLAR OF FIRE.
[1:41:00] &gt;&gt; HE HAVE IMMORTAL HIMSELF
[1:41:03] &gt;&gt; FROM THE MIDST OF THE SEVEN GOLDEN
[1:41:05] CANDLESTICK. HE CAME BACK TO THE PILLAR
[1:41:08] OF FIRE FOR
[1:41:10] &gt;&gt; BUT WHEN HE'S COMING BACK IN THE FORM OF
[1:41:12] A PILLAR OF FIRE, HIS FACE IS SHINING
[1:41:14] LIKE THE SUN.
[1:41:16] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND THE FIRST ONE IS SHINE. WE
[1:41:20] KNOW THAT IT BRINGS THE INTERPRETATION
[1:41:22] OF THE THUNDERS.
[1:41:25] &gt;&gt; YES SIR.
[1:41:26] &gt;&gt; I HOPE WE are together.
[1:41:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:27] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. AMEN.
[1:41:29] &gt;&gt; AND VERSE TWO. AND HE HAD IN WHAT?
[1:41:32] &gt;&gt; His hand.
[1:41:32] &gt;&gt; What?
[1:41:33] &gt;&gt; THE LITTLE BOOK.
[1:41:34] &gt;&gt; REMEMBER MOSES HAD THE LAW.
[1:41:37] &gt;&gt; Moses had the law.
[1:41:39] &gt;&gt; This one has the book.
[1:41:41] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:41:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. He has a little book open and he
[1:41:45] set his right foot where
[1:41:46] &gt;&gt; upon the sea
[1:41:47] &gt;&gt; and his left foot
[1:41:48] &gt;&gt; on the earth.
[1:41:49] &gt;&gt; He's controlling the two beasts. AND HE
[1:41:51] CRY WITH A WHAT?
[1:41:53] &gt;&gt; A loud voice.
[1:41:54] &gt;&gt; AS WHEN A LION IS DOING WHAT?
[1:41:56] &gt;&gt; ROARING.
[1:41:57] &gt;&gt; AND WHEN HE HAD CRIED, WHAT HAPPENED?
[1:41:59] &gt;&gt; Seven thunders uttered THEIR VOICES.
[1:42:01] &gt;&gt; SO SOMEBODY GOES BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM
[1:42:03] BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM.
[1:42:04] &gt;&gt; UH-HUH.
[1:42:05] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:42:06] &gt;&gt; Are we together? AMEN.
[1:42:07] &gt;&gt; IF YOU STAND THERE, THIS IS WHAT YOU'RE
[1:42:09] GOING TO HEAR. BUT WHEN JOHN HEARD BOOM
[1:42:11] BOOM BOOM BOOM BOOM JOHN PICK UP THE PEN
[1:42:17] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE JOHN HEARD THE INTERPRETATION
[1:42:20] &gt;&gt; OF THE THUNDER.
[1:42:22] &gt;&gt; HE WAS STANDING FOR THE OUTSIDE
[1:42:24] &gt;&gt; BUT FOR THE INSIDE IT WAS THE WORD OF
[1:42:26] GOD.
[1:42:28] &gt;&gt; FOR THE PEOPLE OUTSIDE THIS MESSAGE IS A
[1:42:30] THUNDER
[1:42:31] &gt;&gt; BUT FOR US IT IS THE VOICE OF GOD
[1:42:35] &gt;&gt; THAT IS SPEAKING TO US ALL.
[1:42:41] ARE WE TOGETHER?
[1:42:43] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[1:42:44] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:42:44] &gt;&gt; VERSE FOUR. AND WHEN THE SEVEN THUNDER
[1:42:47] HAS DONE WHAT?
[1:42:48] &gt;&gt; THEIR VOICES.
[1:42:49] &gt;&gt; I WAS ABOUT TO DO WHAT?
[1:42:50] &gt;&gt; RIGHT.
[1:42:51] &gt;&gt; SO he heard something.
[1:42:54] &gt;&gt; And if John was about to write, he heard
[1:42:56] it in his own language.
[1:43:04] &gt;&gt; Can you write Chinese?
[1:43:06] &gt;&gt; Can you write Chinese? because you don't
[1:43:08] know Chinese. For you to write Chinese,
[1:43:11] you need to know the language of the
[1:43:12] Chinese. For John to write, he was
[1:43:15] spoken in his own language.
[1:43:21] &gt;&gt; I MUST SPEAK THIS MESSAGE IN ENGLISH.
[1:43:23] [cheering]
[1:43:24] &gt;&gt; BUT IN YOUR HEART, [screaming] YOU ARE
[1:43:26] UNDERSTANDING IT IN YOUR OWN LANGUAGE.
[1:43:33] IN OTHER WORDS, YOU ARE UNDERSTANDING
[1:43:35] THAT EVEN BETTER THAN WHAT I'M
[1:43:37] EXPRESSING HERE.
[1:43:40] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[1:43:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:42] &gt;&gt; I hope we ARE TOGETHER.
[1:43:43] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:43:43] &gt;&gt; HE SAYS, I WAS ABOUT TO WRITE AND I
[1:43:46] HEARD A VOICE FROM WHAT?
[1:43:48] &gt;&gt; From heaven
[1:43:49] &gt;&gt; saying what?
[1:43:50] &gt;&gt; Unto me
[1:43:50] &gt;&gt; saying, do what?
[1:43:51] &gt;&gt; Seal up those things which the seven
[1:43:53] thunders uttered and
[1:43:54] &gt;&gt; and do
[1:43:55] &gt;&gt; and write THEM NOT.
[1:43:56] &gt;&gt; SO THE SEVEN THUNDER WERE DONE WHAT?
[1:43:58] &gt;&gt; SEALED.
[1:43:59] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. SO WHEN THE THUNDER SPOKE,
[1:44:02] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:44:03] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:44:03] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:44:04] &gt;&gt; THEY BROUGHT A RECORDING
[1:44:07] &gt;&gt; AND THE RECORDING OF THE THUNDER WAS THE
[1:44:09] SEALS
[1:44:11] &gt;&gt; AND THE SEAL SWALLOW UP THE THUNDER
[1:44:14] &gt;&gt; AND THE SEAL CLOSE THE THUNDER.
[1:44:16] &gt;&gt; SO WHEN THE SEAL ARE BROKEN,
[1:44:19] &gt;&gt; THE SEAL ARE RELEASING
[1:44:21] &gt;&gt; THE INTERPRETATION OF WHAT THE THUNDER
[1:44:24] SAY. AMEN.
[1:44:27] THAT'S WHY BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID THE
[1:44:29] THUNDER WILL REVEAL UNDER THE SEALS.
[1:44:32] [cheering]
[1:44:35] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:44:36] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:44:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:38] &gt;&gt; Everything clear so far?
[1:44:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:40] &gt;&gt; Let's begin our sermon.
[1:44:47] &gt;&gt; You did good, my friend.
[1:44:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:51] &gt;&gt; Last Sunday, let's pick up this and we
[1:44:53] move on. WE FIND THAT JESUS SAY IN JOHN
[1:44:56] 15 that ye have what?
[1:44:58] &gt;&gt; Not chosen me.
[1:44:59] &gt;&gt; But what happened?
[1:45:00] &gt;&gt; I have chosen you
[1:45:01] &gt;&gt; and did what?
[1:45:01] &gt;&gt; Ordained you.
[1:45:02] &gt;&gt; So Jesus chosen us.
[1:45:05] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:45:06] &gt;&gt; And did what?
[1:45:06] &gt;&gt; Ordained us.
[1:45:07] &gt;&gt; And ordained us.
[1:45:10] &gt;&gt; Ordin us to do what?
[1:45:12] &gt;&gt; That you should bring forth fruit.
[1:45:14] &gt;&gt; That we should bring forth what?
[1:45:15] &gt;&gt; Fruit.
[1:45:16] &gt;&gt; We should bring forth fruit. And that
[1:45:18] what happened?
[1:45:18] &gt;&gt; Your fruit should remain.
[1:45:20] &gt;&gt; So we were all chosen.
[1:45:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Number one,
[1:45:24] &gt;&gt; and orained,
[1:45:26] &gt;&gt; PREDESTINATED,
[1:45:29] &gt;&gt; FABRICATED,
[1:45:30] &gt;&gt; PREPARE.
[1:45:32] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:45:33] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:45:33] &gt;&gt; TO BRING FORTH WHAT?
[1:45:35] &gt;&gt; FRUIT.
[1:45:35] &gt;&gt; IF YOU LOOK, THAT FRUIT IS NOT PLURAL.
[1:45:38] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[1:45:40] &gt;&gt; Verify in your Bible.
[1:45:42] &gt;&gt; IT IS A FRUIT IN THE SINGULAR.
[1:45:45] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:45:46] &gt;&gt; AND WE KNOW THAT FRUIT ARE USUALLY IN
[1:45:49] the seed.
[1:45:51] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. AMEN.
[1:45:53] &gt;&gt; YES SIR.
[1:45:54] &gt;&gt; WHEN WHEN YOU TAKE AN APPLE seed
[1:45:56] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[1:45:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:58] &gt;&gt; And you and you plant it, it is not the
[1:46:00] water that bring the apple.
[1:46:03] &gt;&gt; Every apple is already in the seed.
[1:46:07] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:46:08] &gt;&gt; SO YOUR PREDESTINATED SEED HAS a fruit.
[1:46:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:14] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:46:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:16] &gt;&gt; And this fruit JESUS SAY AND THAT YOUR
[1:46:19] FRUIT SHOULD DO WHAT?
[1:46:20] &gt;&gt; REMAIN. SO THIS IS NOT A FRUIT THAT CAN
[1:46:22] BE DESTROYED.
[1:46:23] &gt;&gt; NO SIR.
[1:46:24] &gt;&gt; IT IS AN ETERNAL FRUIT.
[1:46:28] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:46:29] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:46:29] &gt;&gt; And Jesus continue. He says what?
[1:46:32] &gt;&gt; That whatsoever ye shall ask.
[1:46:33] &gt;&gt; In other word WHEN YOU BRING FORTH
[1:46:36] FRUIT,
[1:46:38] &gt;&gt; a fruit that REMAIN
[1:46:40] &gt;&gt; ONCE THAT FRUIT IS MANIFESTED IN YOUR
[1:46:43] LIFE,
[1:46:44] &gt;&gt; WHATSOEVER YOU ASK,
[1:46:46] &gt;&gt; take your time right there.
[1:46:48] &gt;&gt; Take your time right there.
[1:46:52] THERE WILL BE A TIME IN YOUR LIFE YOU
[1:46:54] COULD NOT BRING THE FRUIT
[1:46:55] &gt;&gt; BUT THE FRUIT WAS IN YOU
[1:46:58] &gt;&gt; AT THAT TIME WHEN YOU ASK GOD DOESN'T
[1:47:00] KNOW WHAT TO GIVE YOU ALL the time
[1:47:03] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE YOU ARE NOT FULLY CONVERTED to
[1:47:05] him yet
[1:47:06] &gt;&gt; there is
[1:47:08] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER BUT WHEN YOU MANIFESTED
[1:47:11] THE FRUIT
[1:47:12] &gt;&gt; COME ON NOW LORD
[1:47:14] &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU BRING FORTH THE FRUIT
[1:47:16] &gt;&gt; GOD IS 100% SURE THAT THIS ONE WILL GO
[1:47:21] NOWHERE.
[1:47:22] &gt;&gt; YES SIR. [cheering]
[1:47:26] &gt;&gt; IN OTHER WORD YOU WERE MANIFESTED WHAT
[1:47:29] YOU WERE SET FOR.
[1:47:31] &gt;&gt; YES SIR.
[1:47:33] &gt;&gt; IN OTHER WORD YOU BECOME THE WORD.
[1:47:40] &gt;&gt; YES SIR.
[1:47:40] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE EVERY SEED MUST BE REPRODUCED
[1:47:44] ACCORDING TO ITS OWN KIND.
[1:47:46] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:47:47] BECAUSE YOU SHALL KNOW THEM BY THEIR
[1:47:49] FRUIT.
[1:47:50] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:47:51] &gt;&gt; SO WHEN YOUR TRUE IDENTITY IS
[1:47:53] MANIFESTED,
[1:47:55] &gt;&gt; GOD HAVE NO PROBLEM WITH YOUR
[1:47:57] CONFIDENCE.
[1:48:00] &gt;&gt; Glory to God.
[1:48:03] &gt;&gt; When God was giving Peter the keys,
[1:48:06] &gt;&gt; he knew the weakness of Peter,
[1:48:10] &gt;&gt; BUT HE DIDN'T CARE ABOUT THE WEAKNESS
[1:48:13] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HE KNEW PETER WILL ALWAYS COME
[1:48:15] BACK. AMEN.
[1:48:19] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[1:48:21] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[1:48:22] &gt;&gt; THAT WILL NOT CHANGE GOD'S DECISION.
[1:48:25] &gt;&gt; SO ONCE YOU REACH THE POINT THAT YOU
[1:48:28] HAVE REPRODUCED,
[1:48:30] &gt;&gt; MANIFESTED
[1:48:31] &gt;&gt; THE FRUIT OF GOD.
[1:48:33] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:48:35] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? THEN FROM THAT POINT
[1:48:38] WHATSOEVER
[1:48:45] &gt;&gt; listen my friend

[1:48:49] &gt;&gt; came to bring believer to 10.
[1:48:52] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[1:48:53] &gt;&gt; Okay sir.
[1:48:55] &gt;&gt; Since 50 60 years.
[1:48:57] &gt;&gt; We are still preaching believer to six
[1:49:00] [applause and cheering]
[1:49:02] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE EVERYBODY IS AFRAID OF THEM.
[1:49:07] 10 SEEMS IMPOSSIBLE.
[1:49:09] &gt;&gt; FOR 50 YEARS, WE KEEP PREACHING people
[1:49:12] to six.
[1:49:12] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:49:13] &gt;&gt; I'm going to get TO THAT
[1:49:15] &gt;&gt; IN THIS CHURCH. I'M NOT GOING TO SHOOT
[1:49:17] FOR SIX.
[1:49:19] &gt;&gt; I WILL CONTINUE TO SHOOT FOR 10.
[1:49:27] &gt;&gt; I WILL CONTINUE TO SHOOT UNTIL YOU
[1:49:31] UNDERSTAND THAT'S NOT JESUS. BUT ALL
[1:49:34] YOUR PRAYER ARE ALWAYS ANSWERED.
[1:49:44] &gt;&gt; I don't know if WE TOGETHER.
[1:49:45] &gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW IF WE TOGETHER.
[1:49:48] &gt;&gt; IF SOME IF SOMEBODY CAN'T CLIMB UP
[1:49:51] HIGHER,
[1:49:52] &gt;&gt; they want to block everybody
[1:49:54] &gt;&gt; to stay where they are.

[1:56:16] THE NAME OF JESUS, [cheering]
[1:56:20] &gt;&gt; YOU SHALL RECEIVE IT. YOU ARE COMING IN

[1:56:32] &gt;&gt; Amen. I hope we ARE TOGETHER.
[1:56:34] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:56:34] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE JESUS CHOSE YOU
[1:56:37] &gt;&gt; AND ORDAINED YOU.
[1:56:39] &gt;&gt; THEREFORE, YOU CAN USE HIS NAME.
[1:56:43] [cheering]
[1:56:45] &gt;&gt; HE HAS CONFIDENCE.
[1:56:51] [applause]
[1:56:51] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:56:52] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:56:54] &gt;&gt; HE SAYS IF YOU ASK WHATSOEVER YOU ASK
[1:56:56] THE FATHER WHY
[1:56:57] &gt;&gt; IN MY NAME
[1:56:58] &gt;&gt; I WILL DO WHAT?
[1:56:59] &gt;&gt; He may give it to you.
[1:57:00] &gt;&gt; He will get HE MAY GIVE. GOD WILL GIVE
[1:57:02] IT TO YOU.
[1:57:03] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? WHY? BECAUSE GOD CHOSE
[1:57:06] you
[1:57:07] &gt;&gt; and God ordained you.
[1:57:09] &gt;&gt; AND WE FOUND OUT THAT CHOOSING SOME
[1:57:12] PEOPLE ARE CHOSEN.
[1:57:13] &gt;&gt; YES, THEY ARE.
[1:57:14] &gt;&gt; BUT NOT TO BRING FRUIT.
[1:57:20] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[1:57:21] &gt;&gt; WE FOUND JUDAS WAS CHOSEN.
[1:57:24] &gt;&gt; HE WAS CHOSEN AMONG THE 12.
[1:57:27] &gt;&gt; BUT HE WAS A DEVIL.
[1:57:30] ARE WE TOGETHER?
[1:57:31] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HE WAS THE SON OF
[1:57:33] &gt;&gt; PREDITION.
[1:57:35] &gt;&gt; HE CANNOT CALL GOD HIS FATHER.
[1:57:37] &gt;&gt; NO SIR.
[1:57:39] &gt;&gt; NO SIR.
[1:57:39] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HE CAME FROM HELL.
[1:57:41] &gt;&gt; PITION means hell.
[1:57:43] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[1:57:44] &gt;&gt; AND JESUS SAID, "I CHOSE YOU ALL OF
[1:57:46] YOU."
[1:57:47] &gt;&gt; But one of you is what?
[1:57:49] &gt;&gt; That was in John 6.
[1:57:50] &gt;&gt; WE KNOW BY JOHN 13, JUDAH LEFT.
[1:57:53] &gt;&gt; And once Judah left, Jesus changed the
[1:57:55] language.
[1:57:56] &gt;&gt; He said, "Who staying here? There is no
[1:57:58] more child of the devil. They all gone
[1:58:00] from the message. Okay. Now I need to
[1:58:03] change the language. Now let me bring
[1:58:05] another ministry
[1:58:07] &gt;&gt; that WILL BEGIN TO UNFOLD TO THEM who
[1:58:09] they are.
[1:58:10] &gt;&gt; WHEN EVERYBODY WHEN THE PARASITES ARE
[1:58:12] GONE.
[1:58:13] &gt;&gt; YES SIR.
[1:58:15] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:58:16] &gt;&gt; He say you I have chosen you.
[1:58:18] &gt;&gt; I ALREADY CHOSE YOU THE FIRST TIME BUT
[1:58:20] THIS TIME I'M REVEALING to you
[1:58:22] something. I chose you and I ordain YOU
[1:58:25] TO BRING FORTH FRUIT.
[1:58:29] ARE WE TOGETHER?
[1:58:30] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:58:30] &gt;&gt; WHAT IS THE FRUIT? BROTHER BRANDHAM SAY
[1:58:33] WHAT IS THE FRUIT? THE FRUIT IS WHAT?
[1:58:34] &gt;&gt; THE WORD.
[1:58:35] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE WORD HAVE EVERYTHING.
[1:58:37] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:58:40] [cheering]
[1:58:41] &gt;&gt; THE FRUIT OF THE SPIRIT ARE IN THE WORD.
[1:58:44] &gt;&gt; THE WORD.
[1:58:44] &gt;&gt; HE SAYS WHAT IS THE FRUIT IS WHAT?
[1:58:46] &gt;&gt; THE WORD.
[1:58:47] &gt;&gt; THE FRUIT FOR WHAT?
[1:58:48] &gt;&gt; THE SEASON.
[1:58:49] &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT JUST THE WORD. THE WORD OF THE
[1:58:52] SEASON.
[1:58:52] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[1:58:53] &gt;&gt; AH THAT IS WHAT IT IS. THE WHAT
[1:58:56] &gt;&gt; TEACHING. THE TEACHING OF WHAT?
[1:59:02] &gt;&gt; I didn't write this quote.
[1:59:07] &gt;&gt; Did Brother Brandham say they're
[1:59:08] preaching?
[1:59:09] &gt;&gt; NO.
[1:59:13] [cheering]
[1:59:14] &gt;&gt; YEAH. You saying that because you a
[1:59:16] teacher? Of course.
[1:59:19] &gt;&gt; Yeah. I DON'T HAVE TIME TO BE HUMBLE.
[1:59:20] HUMBLE. HUMBLE. Of course.
[1:59:22] &gt;&gt; There is a reason why I'M A TEACHER.
[1:59:25] BECAUSE SOMEBODY NEED TO HEAR THE
[1:59:27] TEACHING OF the season,
[1:59:30] THE TEACHING OF MALACHI 4, REVELATION
[1:59:33] 10, THE TEACHING OF THE MESSAGE.
[1:59:37] BECAUSE BROTHER BRANDHAM SAY YOU CANNOT
[1:59:39] HAVE FAITH CORRECTLY IF YOU ARE NOT
[1:59:42] CORRECTLY TAUGHT.
[1:59:45] &gt;&gt; AND BROTHER BRANDHAM SAY A CHURCH CAN
[1:59:48] NEVER GO HIGHER THAN THE TEACHING,
[1:59:51] &gt;&gt; NOT THE PREACHING, THE TEACHING OF IT
[1:59:54] PASTOR.
[1:59:55] &gt;&gt; [cheering]
[1:59:57] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[1:59:59] &gt;&gt; THE TEACHING OF WHAT?
[2:00:02] &gt;&gt; Of the season. THE TEACHING OF WHAT
[2:00:05] &gt;&gt; NOT ANY TYPE OF TEACHING.
[2:00:07] &gt;&gt; WE NEED TO SEE WHO YOUR TEACHING IS.
[2:00:09] YOUR TEACHING MUST BE ACCORDING TO
[2:00:11] MALACHI 4.
[2:00:14] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY WHEN WE TEACH WE SAY BROTHER
[2:00:17] SAY WE NEED TO KNOW WHERE YOUR TEACHING
[2:00:19] ARE COMING FROM. [cheering]
[2:00:24] WE NEED TO KNOW THE ORIGIN OF THE
[2:00:25] TEACHING
[2:00:27] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE IT'S IMPORTANT TO PRODUCE THAT
[2:00:29] TEACHING.
[2:00:33] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:00:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:34] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:00:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:36] &gt;&gt; You were chosen and you were ordained to
[2:00:39] bring forth the fruit. In other words,
[2:00:41] to bring forth the word.
[2:00:43] &gt;&gt; That's exactly right.
[2:00:47] &gt;&gt; What I'm saying here,
[2:00:49] &gt;&gt; you see the message? The message
[2:00:52] &gt;&gt; the message should not struggle with
[2:00:54] you.
[2:00:57] &gt;&gt; The living of the message for you is
[2:00:59] automatic
[2:01:03] &gt;&gt; because you were ordained for it.
[2:01:06] [cheering]
[2:01:08] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:01:09] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:01:10] &gt;&gt; If you a woman,
[2:01:11] &gt;&gt; do you when you are growing up, do you
[2:01:14] tell your body change to a woman?
[2:01:16] &gt;&gt; Change to a woman. Now it's time for you
[2:01:18] to see your your your sac. Remember body
[2:01:22] &gt;&gt; when you are even eating I mean whatever
[2:01:26] I mean fruit or whatever your body knows
[2:01:28] what it's doing
[2:01:29] &gt;&gt; because your body knows that this is a
[2:01:31] woman.
[2:01:34] &gt;&gt; You can become a man and your body still
[2:01:36] know that you a woman.
[2:01:42] &gt;&gt; Your body already know that you a woman.
[2:01:44] YOU WON'T CHEAT THAT BODY BECAUSE YOUR
[2:01:47] BODY WAS ORDAINED
[2:01:49] &gt;&gt; AND CHOSEN TO BE A WOMAN. YOU WERE
[2:01:52] ORDAINED AND CHOSEN TO BE THE BRIDE.
[2:01:56] &gt;&gt; IN OTHER WORDS, YOUR SOUL KNOWS WHO YOU
[2:01:59] ARE.
[2:02:06] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:02:06] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? AMEN.
[2:02:07] &gt;&gt; YOU DON'T STRUGGLE WITH THE MESSAGE. YOU
[2:02:09] DON'T WRESTLE WITH THE MESSAGE.
[2:02:11] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:02:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:12] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:02:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. YOU MIGHT EVEN TRY AND A CERTAIN
[2:02:15] POINT YOU JUST LET GO BECAUSE IT'S NOT
[2:02:17] YOU LETTING YOU GO. NO, YOUR BODY IS
[2:02:20] WORKING.
[2:02:21] &gt;&gt; AMEN. You were ordained and you were
[2:02:23] predestinated.
[2:02:25] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:02:26] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:02:27] &gt;&gt; BUT IF YOU NOTICE, JUDAH NEVER MADE IT
[2:02:29] TO THE PENTECOST.
[2:02:32] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:02:33] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:02:34] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[2:02:35] &gt;&gt; HE NEVER MADE IT TO THE UPPER ROOM.
[2:02:38] &gt;&gt; HE DIED WITHOUT THE HOLY GHOST.
[2:02:41] BUT YET HE SERVED GOD
[2:02:43] &gt;&gt; TO A CERTAIN POINT.
[2:02:48] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[2:02:49] &gt;&gt; THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN YOU AND OTHER
[2:02:51] PEOPLE, OTHER PEOPLE WILL SERVE GOD TO A
[2:02:55] CERTAIN POINT.
[2:03:01] [cheering]
[2:03:04] &gt;&gt; SOME SOME PEOPLE SERVE GOD WHEN THEY
[2:03:09] PLATEAU. THEY LEFT THE MESSAGE.
[2:03:12] &gt;&gt; SOME DON'T WANT TO LEAVE THE MESSAGE.
[2:03:14] &gt;&gt; THEY ARE STILL AROUND THE MESSAGE
[2:03:16] PEOPLE.
[2:03:17] &gt;&gt; BUT IF YOU GET ALONG WITH THEM, THEY
[2:03:19] DON'T PUSH.
[2:03:21] &gt;&gt; THEY CANNOT MOVE.
[2:03:24] &gt;&gt; THEY ALREADY PLATEAU.
[2:03:27] &gt;&gt; THEY ARE IN A RELIGIOUS MODE. [cheering]
[2:03:32] &gt;&gt; THEY DON'T STRIVE TO SEE [screaming]
[2:03:34] MORE GOD IN THEIR LIVES.
[2:03:37] &gt;&gt; THEY ARE COMFORTABLE.
[2:03:39] [applause]
[2:03:44] ARE WE TOGETHER?
[2:03:45] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:03:46] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:03:47] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? SO, SOME PEOPLE SERVE
[2:03:49] GOD TO A CERTAIN POINT,
[2:03:51] &gt;&gt; BUT WHEN TO REACH THE CLIMATE, THEY WILL
[2:03:54] NEVER REACH IT.
[2:03:56] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY THE BIBLE SAY, "HAVE WE NOW
[2:03:58] PROPHESY?"
[2:03:59] &gt;&gt; THEY WERE PROPHESYING.
[2:04:01] &gt;&gt; HAVE WE NOT CAST OUT DEVIL?
[2:04:03] &gt;&gt; THEY WERE CASTING OUT DEVIL. AND JESUS
[2:04:05] TURNED AND HE SAY, "I NEVER KNEW YOU."
[2:04:08] AND THE PROPHECY IS THE SECOND POOL.
[2:04:10] &gt;&gt; CUZ THAT DEVIL IS THE FIRST P
[2:04:13] &gt;&gt; BUT THE THIRD P THEY CANNOT REACH IT.
[2:04:19] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:04:21] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[2:04:22] &gt;&gt; SO AMONG THE SERVANT OF GOD, AMONG THE
[2:04:26] DISCIPLE OF GOD, THERE ARE TWO
[2:04:28] CATEGORIES.
[2:04:30] &gt;&gt; THERE ARE SOME THAT WILL GO ALL THE WAY
[2:04:32] AND PRODUCE FRUIT.
[2:04:35] AMEN.
[2:04:38] &gt;&gt; AND THERE ARE SOME THAT WILL GO AT A
[2:04:40] CERTAIN LEVEL AND THEY BLOCK BECAUSE
[2:04:43] THEY WERE NOT ORDAINED.
[2:04:46] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:04:48] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY THIS MESSAGE IS NOT A GROUP
[2:04:50] REVELATION.
[2:04:52] &gt;&gt; IT IS AN INDIVIDUAL REVELATION.
[2:04:56] &gt;&gt; WHEN GOD OPEN UP, MOVE FORWARD.
[2:04:59] &gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW WHO YOU ARE. I DON'T KNOW
[2:05:02] IF YOU ARE ORDAINED
[2:05:04] &gt;&gt; TO PRODUCE WHAT GOD TOLD ME TO PRODUCE.
[2:05:10] [applause]
[2:05:12] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:05:14] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:05:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:15] &gt;&gt; Are we clear so far?
[2:05:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:17] &gt;&gt; We clear so far.
[2:05:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:18] &gt;&gt; Let's go to the parable of the mana
[2:05:22] &gt;&gt; of the panda.
[2:05:25] &gt;&gt; Your prayer has been answered.
[2:05:28] &gt;&gt; [laughter]
[2:05:30] &gt;&gt; Let's go to the parable. Let's go to
[2:05:32] Luke 19.
[2:05:35] &gt;&gt; Keep your seat belt, my friend.
[2:05:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:39] &gt;&gt; This is a B2 bombers.
[2:05:41] So there is no way you can be high there
[2:05:43] and take your seat belt off. No, this
[2:05:45] airplane you don't take the seat belt
[2:05:47] because they flip in the air. Uhhuh. So
[2:05:50] you have to to keep and they flip. You
[2:05:53] you see them and then they keep moving.
[2:05:55] So when you flip, you don't want to drop
[2:05:57] there or without a seat belt. You stay
[2:05:59] there. You put the mask and everything
[2:06:01] because it's high pressure.
[2:06:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:06:06] &gt;&gt; Luke 19, my friend.
[2:06:08] &gt;&gt; Remember before this parable, the story
[2:06:10] was about Zakius.
[2:06:15] &gt;&gt; You remember that?
[2:06:17] &gt;&gt; You remember that?
[2:06:18] &gt;&gt; The story was about Zakius. Then Jesus
[2:06:21] begin to talk to THE PEOPLE THAT WERE in
[2:06:23] the house of Zakius.
[2:06:25] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:06:26] &gt;&gt; That's uh verse 10. And verse 10, FOR
[2:06:29] THE SON OF MAN IS WHAT?
[2:06:31] &gt;&gt; Come to seek.
[2:06:32] &gt;&gt; Let's go to verse 9. So we pick up the
[2:06:34] background. And Jesus said to him, "This
[2:06:37] day is what?
[2:06:38] &gt;&gt; Salvation come to this house."
[2:06:39] &gt;&gt; Uh-huh.
[2:06:40] &gt;&gt; For so much as he also is the son of
[2:06:42] Abraham.
[2:06:44] &gt;&gt; For the son of man has come to seek and
[2:06:46] to save that which was lost. The son of
[2:06:48] man is come to seek and save that which
[2:06:50] is what
[2:06:51] &gt;&gt; lost.
[2:06:51] &gt;&gt; Verse 11, we studying the parable. AND
[2:06:54] AS THEY DID WHAT?
[2:06:56] &gt;&gt; Heard these things.
[2:06:57] &gt;&gt; In other words, WHEN THE PEOPLE WERE
[2:06:58] focused
[2:07:00] &gt;&gt; to listen to what Jesus was saying
[2:07:02] &gt;&gt; and Jesus SAW THAT HE CAUGHT their
[2:07:05] attention.
[2:07:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:07] &gt;&gt; Jesus flip another parable
[2:07:10] &gt;&gt; because the people become more
[2:07:11] attentive.
[2:07:13] &gt;&gt; Jesus is talking. Everybody's paying
[2:07:15] attention. WHEN JESUS SAW THAT THE
[2:07:17] AUDIENCE is paying attention, Jesus
[2:07:19] brought something
[2:07:20] &gt;&gt; and loaded.
[2:07:22] &gt;&gt; Are we clear?
[2:07:23] &gt;&gt; Verse 11. And as they heard these
[2:07:26] things, he added, you see, he's adding
[2:07:30] &gt;&gt; he added what?
[2:07:31] &gt;&gt; And spake a parable.
[2:07:32] &gt;&gt; And spake a parable because he was what?
[2:07:36] &gt;&gt; Nigh to Jerusalem.
[2:07:37] &gt;&gt; He was nine to Jerusalem. And because
[2:07:40] they taught that water,
[2:07:41] &gt;&gt; the kingdom of God should immediately
[2:07:43] appear. So the reason of this PARABLE
[2:07:47] IS THAT JESUS WAS GETTING CLOSER TO
[2:07:50] JERUSALEM.
[2:07:51] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:07:52] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:07:53] &gt;&gt; And his way toward Jerusalem was to die.
[2:07:57] &gt;&gt; Follow me my friend. I told you this
[2:07:59] thing flip in the head.
[2:08:00] &gt;&gt; His way toward Jerusalem, he was going
[2:08:03] to die.
[2:08:04] &gt;&gt; As the Messiah to die at the cross.
[2:08:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:08] &gt;&gt; BUT THE PEOPLE EXPECTATION WAS NOT ABOUT
[2:08:11] his death. Amen.
[2:08:15] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:08:16] &gt;&gt; REMEMBER WHEN HE entered Jerusalem,
[2:08:19] &gt;&gt; they were waiting for him
[2:08:21] &gt;&gt; and they were crying, "HOSANA, SON OF
[2:08:23] David and everything."
[2:08:24] &gt;&gt; THEY WERE NOW WAITING FOR A SON OF DAVID
[2:08:27] TO DIE.
[2:08:28] &gt;&gt; THEY WERE EXPECTING THE KING.
[2:08:35] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. AH,
[2:08:37] &gt;&gt; THE MESSIAH THAT YOU HEAR IN THE
[2:08:39] scripture
[2:08:40] &gt;&gt; was supposed to be king.
[2:08:45] &gt;&gt; That's correct.
[2:08:46] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[2:08:48] &gt;&gt; WHEN GOD PULLED ISRAEL OUT OF EGYPT,
[2:08:52] &gt;&gt; God pulled them to become his people.
[2:08:55] &gt;&gt; AMEN. AND GOD WAS DIRECTING ISRAEL with
[2:08:59] a prophet.
[2:09:01] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[2:09:02] &gt;&gt; AND THE PROPHET REPRESENTED GOD. AMEN.
[2:09:06] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:09:06] &gt;&gt; TO THE PEOPLE. HE WAS GOD'S SPOKESMAN
[2:09:09] &gt;&gt; TO THE PEOPLE. AND THE INTENT OF GOD WAS
[2:09:12] THAT AT THE LATTER DAY, God himself will
[2:09:16] come
[2:09:17] &gt;&gt; and dwell with his PEOPLE
[2:09:19] &gt;&gt; AND BECOME THEIR KING.
[2:09:22] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[2:09:23] &gt;&gt; BUT ISRAEL AS THEY WERE JOURNEYING
[2:09:26] &gt;&gt; AND THEY WERE GOING THROUGH BATTLE.
[2:09:28] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:09:30] &gt;&gt; THEY WERE GOING WITH A GENERAL UNDER THE
[2:09:32] COMMAND OF GOD. AND THEY SAW THAT ALL
[2:09:34] THE NATION WHEN THEY GO TO THE BATTLE
[2:09:37] THEY HAVE SOMEBODY WEARING A CROWN
[2:09:40] &gt;&gt; WHO'S THERE AND SAY ONWARD
[2:09:42] &gt;&gt; AND THEY LOOK EVERYBODY HAVE A KING
[2:09:45] &gt;&gt; UNTIL ISRAEL BEGIN TO ENVY
[2:09:50] &gt;&gt; THAT ORDER
[2:09:51] &gt;&gt; FORGETTING THAT THE PILLAR OF FIRE
[2:09:54] &gt;&gt; WAS THE KING
[2:09:58] &gt;&gt; AND THE PILLAR OF FIRE WAS WAITING FOR
[2:10:01] ONE DAY TO BECOME I'M A MAN.
[2:10:07] &gt;&gt; AND TO BE CROWNED AS [screaming] A KING.
[2:10:10] &gt;&gt; SO WHEN THEY SAW IT, THEY WERE SO
[2:10:13] IMPATIENT.
[2:10:15] &gt;&gt; They say, "You know what? No, no, no,
[2:10:17] no, no, no, no. You know what? Uh,
[2:10:19] Samuel.
[2:10:20] &gt;&gt; Ah, when we see I mean we we know you
[2:10:23] know
[2:10:26] all kind of reason begin to raise up.
[2:10:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. because we want to copy the world.
[2:10:37] &gt;&gt; The king is already there.
[2:10:39] &gt;&gt; And God told Samuel, they are rejecting
[2:10:41] me
[2:10:42] &gt;&gt; because I'm there AS THE KING.
[2:10:44] &gt;&gt; BUT THEY WANT to match THE WORLD.
[2:10:46] &gt;&gt; THEY DON'T WANT TO BE LEFT OFF.
[2:10:49] &gt;&gt; THEY DON'T WANT THEY ALL THE WHOLE WORLD
[2:10:51] CELEBRATING SOMETHING
[2:10:53] &gt;&gt; and in their home they don't celebrate
[2:10:54] anything. [screaming]
[2:10:55] &gt;&gt; THEY DON'T LOOK GOOD. THEY WANT TO BE
[2:10:58] ALSO WHEN THEIR NEIGHBOR ASK THEM WHAT
[2:11:00] ARE YOU DOING for Christmas
[2:11:04] &gt;&gt; THEY NEED TO ALSO DO something
[2:11:07] &gt;&gt; let me leave it alone
[2:11:09] &gt;&gt; are we together
[2:11:10] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER THEY WANT TO FIT IN THE
[2:11:13] WORD
[2:11:14] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER
[2:11:15] &gt;&gt; THEN THEY PUSH
[2:11:18] &gt;&gt; AND GOD OPEN UP A PERMISSIVE WILL
[2:11:21] [cheering]
[2:11:25] &gt;&gt; AND GAVE THEM SOUL
[2:11:30] AND THAT WAS THE BEGINNING OF THE
[2:11:32] TROUBLE OF ISRAEL.
[2:11:35] &gt;&gt; BUT THE TRUTH WAS THAT GOD HIMSELF
[2:11:38] &gt;&gt; WAS SUPPOSED TO COME AS THE MESSIAH.
[2:11:41] &gt;&gt; THE MESSIAH WAS THE KING OF ISRAEL.
[2:11:46] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:11:47] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? SO WHEN ISRAEL WENT
[2:11:50] UNDER THE ROMAN EMPIRE,
[2:11:54] &gt;&gt; please all this explanation is not my
[2:11:56] minute
[2:11:57] &gt;&gt; because you the one that slow down. So
[2:12:00] take that aside.
[2:12:01] &gt;&gt; It's a it's a parenthesis.
[2:12:03] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:12:05] &gt;&gt; So somebody can pick up.
[2:12:07] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:12:08] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:12:10] &gt;&gt; SO WHEN THE ROMAN TOOK OVER ISRAEL AND
[2:12:13] THE ROMAN WAS MISTREATING ISRAEL, ISRAEL
[2:12:16] HAD A HOPE. WHEN THEY BEAT THEM, they
[2:12:19] say don't worry,
[2:12:20] &gt;&gt; the Messiah will come.
[2:12:22] &gt;&gt; Don't worry, one day the Messiah will
[2:12:24] come.
[2:12:25] &gt;&gt; Don't worry, one day the Messiah WILL
[2:12:27] COME. DON'T. SO WHEN THEY SAY THE
[2:12:29] MESSIAH HAS COME,
[2:12:31] &gt;&gt; ME AND YOU, WE ARE LOOKING AT SOMETHING
[2:12:33] DIFFERENT.
[2:12:34] &gt;&gt; TO THE JEWS, IT MEANS THAT FINALLY
[2:12:37] &gt;&gt; THE KING IS HERE.
[2:12:39] &gt;&gt; THE KING IS HERE.
[2:12:41] &gt;&gt; HE'S GOING TO FIGHT WITH ROME.
[2:12:44] &gt;&gt; YES. HE WAS COMING TO FIGHT WITH ROME
[2:12:47] SPIRITUALLY.
[2:12:50] &gt;&gt; BUT THEY WERE EXPECTING A PHYSICAL
[2:12:52] FIGHT.
[2:12:53] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:12:54] &gt;&gt; AND HE'S GOING TO TAKE THE KINGDOM FROM
[2:12:56] ROME
[2:12:57] &gt;&gt; AND BRING ISRAEL BACK AGAIN
[2:13:00] &gt;&gt; LIKE ISRAEL USED TO BE.
[2:13:02] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[2:13:04] &gt;&gt; SO NOW THE KING NOW THE KING IS
[2:13:07] TRAVELING TOWARD WASHINGTON.
[2:13:10] HE'S GOING TOWARD JERUSALEM,
[2:13:12] &gt;&gt; TOWARD THE CAPITAL,
[2:13:14] &gt;&gt; TOWARD WASHINGTON. SO EVERYBODY SAY,
[2:13:17] "PRESIDENT, NOW WE GOING TOWARD
[2:13:19] WASHINGTON DC. HE'S GOING TO GO TO THE
[2:13:22] WHITE HOUSE.
[2:13:23] &gt;&gt; HE'S GOING TO TAKE OVER.
[2:13:25] &gt;&gt; SO WE NEED TO FOLLOW HIM
[2:13:26] &gt;&gt; AND THEN
[2:13:29] &gt;&gt; AND THEN TAKE OVER [screaming]
[2:13:31] EVERYTHING."
[2:13:32] &gt;&gt; WHEN JESUS GOT THAT INTENT,
[2:13:35] &gt;&gt; TAKE YOUR TIME.
[2:13:37] &gt;&gt; [cheering]
[2:13:39] &gt;&gt; YOU understand me now?
[2:13:41] &gt;&gt; Jesus sayh
[2:13:44] &gt;&gt; I need to manage this expectation.
[2:13:47] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY WHEN HE'S COMING THEY SAY
[2:13:49] HOSANA SON OF DAVID KING OF DAVID WHO
[2:13:52] HAVE COME
[2:13:54] &gt;&gt; AND DO YOU KNOW PILOT ASKED HIM ARE YOU
[2:13:56] THE KING OF THE JEWS?
[2:13:58] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THEY KNEW WHAT IT MEANS. THEY
[2:14:00] WERE SAYING THAT IS THE KING OF THE
[2:14:02] JEWS.
[2:14:03] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? REMEMBER THE DISCIPLE
[2:14:05] ASKED HIM, "FATHER, IS THIS AT THIS TIME
[2:14:08] THAT YOU WILL RESTORE?"
[2:14:10] &gt;&gt; DO YOU KNOW THAT SCRIPTURE?
[2:14:13] &gt;&gt; Do you know that scripture?
[2:14:14] &gt;&gt; It's in THE BOOK OF ACTS, CHAPTER ONE.
[2:14:17] &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "IS THIS AT THIS TIME THAT YOU
[2:14:19] WILL RESTORE THE KINGDOM BACK TO
[2:14:21] ISRAEL?" SO, THEY WERE ALL EXPECTING THE
[2:14:24] MESSIAH TO REMOVE ROME AND TAKE THE
[2:14:27] KINGDOM AND JESUS BECOME THE KING. AMEN.
[2:14:30] &gt;&gt; SO WHEN JESUS WAS GETTING CLOSER TO
[2:14:32] WASHINGTON,
[2:14:35] &gt;&gt; I hope WE ARE TOGETHER
[2:14:36] &gt;&gt; CLOSER TO THE CAPITAL TO JERUSALEM.
[2:14:39] &gt;&gt; HE BEGIN TO SEE THE EXPECTATION OF THE
[2:14:41] PEOPLE.
[2:14:42] &gt;&gt; IN OTHER WORDS, EVERYBODY WAS LIKE, "AH,
[2:14:45] &gt;&gt; where are you at? We going to take over.
[2:14:48] &gt;&gt; He's now heading to to DC.
[2:14:51] &gt;&gt; Get your rental car." All of us. All of
[2:14:54] us IN DC WHEN WE ENTER DC ALL OF US WE
[2:14:58] FLAG. HALLELUJAH. WE CAME TO TAKE OVER.
[2:15:02] WE CAME TO TAKE OVER. THE KING IS RIGHT
[2:15:04] HERE.
[2:15:07] &gt;&gt; REMEMBER WHEN THE MAJORS COME?
[2:15:10] &gt;&gt; THEY WERE ASKING FOR WHAT?
[2:15:11] &gt;&gt; WHERE IS WHO?
[2:15:13] &gt;&gt; Where is who?
[2:15:15] &gt;&gt; THE WHO?
[2:15:16] &gt;&gt; THE KING OF WHAT?
[2:15:18] THEY WERE NOT ISRAELITE, BUT THEY KNEW
[2:15:20] THAT DUST STAR WAS POINTING TO THE KING.
[2:15:26] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[2:15:28] &gt;&gt; THEY KNEW THAT THE ONE WHO WAS BORN WAS
[2:15:30] A KING.
[2:15:31] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[2:15:32] &gt;&gt; SO WHEN JESUS SAW THE EXPECTATION,
[2:15:36] &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "These guys are going to be
[2:15:38] disappointed." Yes,
[2:15:40] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE WHEN I GET THERE AND THEY KILL
[2:15:42] ME,
[2:15:43] &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY THE DISCIPLE
[2:15:46] &gt;&gt; ON THE ROAD OF AMAS.
[2:15:48] &gt;&gt; PLEASE, I'M STILL IN PARENTHESIS. I'M IN
[2:15:51] PARENTHESIS. I'm in parenthesis. SO, THE
[2:15:54] DISCIPLE ON THE ROAD TO AMAS, LOOK, THEY
[2:15:57] SAY
[2:15:58] &gt;&gt; WE THOUGHT he was the ONE THAT WAS
[2:16:00] SUPPOSED NOW THEY KILL HIM. THIS IS
[2:16:03] THREE DAYS.
[2:16:04] &gt;&gt; He said, "Oh, you fool.
[2:16:08] &gt;&gt; [laughter]
[2:16:09] &gt;&gt; YOU DID NOT UNDERSTAND THE PROPHET
[2:16:11] &gt;&gt; THAT KINGDOM WILL COME LATER ON.
[2:16:14] &gt;&gt; I HAVE TO DELIVER YOU SPIRITUALLY FIRST.
[2:16:18] &gt;&gt; THE DELIVERANCE START WITH THE SPIRIT
[2:16:21] &gt;&gt; BEFORE THE FLESH.
[2:16:29] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:16:31] &gt;&gt; Are we together? WE CLEAR NOW, MY
[2:16:33] FRIEND. SO NOW JESUS SAW IT
[2:16:36] &gt;&gt; and Jesus say I need to manage this
[2:16:38] expectation.
[2:16:39] &gt;&gt; These guys are waiting for me to go
[2:16:41] there, take the throne and sit on the
[2:16:42] throne.
[2:16:43] &gt;&gt; But they're going to be disappointed
[2:16:44] because when I get there, they hold me.
[2:16:46] They begin to slap me. They say, "What
[2:16:48] type of Messiah is this one?"
[2:16:52] &gt;&gt; And and and when they crucify him, they
[2:16:54] put an inscription.
[2:16:56] &gt;&gt; What did they write there?
[2:16:58] &gt;&gt; This is what?
[2:17:01] &gt;&gt; Do you see what I mean? So how can a
[2:17:03] king be there crucified?
[2:17:05] &gt;&gt; It was difficult to manage. So now Jesus
[2:17:08] begin to give them this parable
[2:17:10] &gt;&gt; to tell them
[2:17:12] &gt;&gt; THE ORDER OF HIS KINGDOM.
[2:17:18] &gt;&gt; Yes sir.
[2:17:19] &gt;&gt; My friend
[2:17:20] &gt;&gt; everything was in parentheses.
[2:17:23] &gt;&gt; Uh because I was told don't say can I
[2:17:26] continue can I continue
[2:17:28] because it will create a problem. I was
[2:17:30] told that so I don't want to say that
[2:17:36] are we together but you need to
[2:17:38] understand the parthesis is also taking
[2:17:40] time
[2:17:42] so you understand better we are
[2:17:44] cooperating it's a cooperation between
[2:17:47] the pastor and the church are we
[2:17:49] cooperating well it's a deal it's a
[2:17:51] win-win deal or you don't win I have to
[2:17:54] win also it's a win-win deal are we
[2:17:57] together
[2:17:58] &gt;&gt; we TOGETHER IN THE BACK AH, we the deal
[2:18:01] is okay, sister Naomi. The deal is good.
[2:18:04] You signed the paper. You heard that? We
[2:18:07] clear so far.
[2:18:09] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:18:11] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? SO THIS PARABLE is
[2:18:14] brought to correct
[2:18:16] &gt;&gt; to manage
[2:18:18] &gt;&gt; to recalibrate
[2:18:21] &gt;&gt; TO REALIGN THE EXPECTATION THAT NO I'M
[2:18:26] NOT GOING TO BECAUSE THE BIBLE SAID THEY
[2:18:28] WERE WAITING FOR THE KINGDOM TO appear
[2:18:30] immediately
[2:18:32] &gt;&gt; AND JESUS SAID HEY NO NO NO LET ME GIVE
[2:18:35] you the ORDER
[2:18:37] &gt;&gt; LET ME TELL YOU WHEN WILL I BE KING.
[2:18:41] AMEN.
[2:18:42] &gt;&gt; I am king
[2:18:44] &gt;&gt; but not the WAY YOU THINKING
[2:18:46] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HE SAY MY KINGDOM parenthesis
[2:18:49] &gt;&gt; is not of this world.
[2:18:50] &gt;&gt; If he was of this world my subject would
[2:18:53] have fight for me.
[2:18:54] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:18:56] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? SO JESUS IS TELLING
[2:18:58] THEM NO NO NO not the WAY YOU THINK.
[2:18:59] THERE WILL BE A TIME THAT I WILL COME
[2:19:02] &gt;&gt; and be a king truly
[2:19:04] &gt;&gt; BUT THIS IS NOT THE TIME.
[2:19:06] &gt;&gt; THERE IS AN ORDER. THERE ARE CERTAIN
[2:19:08] THINGS THAT NEED TO HAPPEN BEFORE I
[2:19:12] BECOME KING.
[2:19:14] &gt;&gt; BEFORE WHAT YOU EXPECTING ME NOW HAPPEN,
[2:19:18] THERE IS A MYSTERIOUS.
[2:19:23] &gt;&gt; THERE IS A MYSTERIOUS SEASON
[2:19:27] &gt;&gt; IN THE PARABLE OF THE TEMPAM.
[2:19:30] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:19:31] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:19:32] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? AMEN.
[2:19:33] &gt;&gt; WE FINISHED THE PARENTHESES. You can see
[2:19:36] how many minutes they took uh brother
[2:19:38] Robert we together.
[2:19:39] &gt;&gt; Now let's go to the parable.
[2:19:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:19:42] &gt;&gt; VERSE 11. AND AS THEY HEARD THESE THINGS
[2:19:45] these things are difficult to go quick
[2:19:47] quick quick. That's why people in the
[2:19:49] message they listen to the sermon they
[2:19:51] don't listen. They don't hear anything.
[2:19:52] They don't because nobody sat there to
[2:19:55] expound.
[2:19:57] &gt;&gt; AS A PASTOR I need to expound. Even if
[2:20:00] it take 20 sermon, LET ME EXPOUND SO
[2:20:04] THAT THE THE THE THE RAM with horn
[2:20:08] &gt;&gt; and the LAMB AND THE LITTLE LAMB WILL
[2:20:10] UNDERSTAND
[2:20:12] &gt;&gt; A PASTOR FEED EVERYBODY
[2:20:15] &gt;&gt; NOT ONLY THE ADULT EVEN THE LITTLE LAMB.
[2:20:17] &gt;&gt; SO GIVE ME MY TIME TO EXPOUND
[2:20:22] &gt;&gt; SO THAT BROTHER ELIJAH WILL LEAVE HERE
[2:20:24] AND KNOW CLEARLY WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT
[2:20:26] &gt;&gt; SO THAT BROTHER LEAH KNOWS WHAT I'M
[2:20:28] TALKING ABOUT. ARE WE TOGETHER?
[2:20:31] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:20:33] &gt;&gt; Okay. Verse 11. And as they heard these
[2:20:35] things, he added and did what?
[2:20:38] &gt;&gt; Spake a parable.
[2:20:39] &gt;&gt; Because he was near what?
[2:20:40] &gt;&gt; To Jerusalem.
[2:20:41] &gt;&gt; AND BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT, NOW YOU BEGIN
[2:20:43] to understand.
[2:20:44] &gt;&gt; THEY THOUGHT THAT THE KINGDOM OF GOD
[2:20:47] SHOULD APPEAR HOW?
[2:20:48] &gt;&gt; IMMEDIATELY.
[2:20:48] &gt;&gt; YOU SEE the they're thinking. So as soon
[2:20:51] as we reach Washington DC,
[2:20:54] &gt;&gt; we declare
[2:20:56] &gt;&gt; the new president
[2:20:57] &gt;&gt; is Jesus Christ on CNN. Let's go on NBC.
[2:21:00] Everybody, let's go over there. We've
[2:21:02] gone over there. Okay. Okay. Okay. You
[2:21:04] move up. Move up. Put the camera. The
[2:21:07] new president.
[2:21:08] &gt;&gt; We taking over.
[2:21:09] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[2:21:10] &gt;&gt; Jesus say, "Hey, I need to manage this
[2:21:12] expectation
[2:21:13] &gt;&gt; before I get there." And I see people
[2:21:15] attacking the Roman.
[2:21:17] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:21:18] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:21:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:20] &gt;&gt; Ah.
[2:21:21] &gt;&gt; Verse 12. And he said, "THEREFORE, A
[2:21:25] CERTAIN WHAT?
[2:21:26] &gt;&gt; NOBLE MAN. THAT WORD nobleman means a
[2:21:30] man of a noble birth.
[2:21:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:33] &gt;&gt; In another translation
[2:21:39] &gt;&gt; can I erase this
[2:21:41] &gt;&gt; because this is very important my
[2:21:42] friend.
[2:21:43] &gt;&gt; A man of water,
[2:21:46] &gt;&gt; a man, a noble man. If you look at
[2:21:49] another translation, it says of a noble
[2:21:52] birth.
[2:21:54] &gt;&gt; His birth is noble. Praise God.
[2:21:57] &gt;&gt; It's a special birth.
[2:21:59] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:22:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:22:01] &gt;&gt; A man of a certain noble man WENT INTO A
[2:22:05] WATER,
[2:22:05] &gt;&gt; a far country.
[2:22:07] &gt;&gt; You remember what far country means?
[2:22:09] &gt;&gt; We already went through this.
[2:22:10] &gt;&gt; Far country means water.
[2:22:14] &gt;&gt; Remember the parable of the talent. I
[2:22:16] gave you the quote. Far country was
[2:22:18] heaven.
[2:22:18] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham say far country means
[2:22:20] heaven. When the people that came to
[2:22:22] visit Abraham,
[2:22:24] &gt;&gt; brother Brandham said they were coming
[2:22:25] from a far country which was heaven.
[2:22:28] &gt;&gt; So far country means what?
[2:22:30] &gt;&gt; HEAVEN.
[2:22:30] &gt;&gt; SO THIS NOBLE BIRTH MAN, this noble man
[2:22:35] was going into heaven.
[2:22:39] &gt;&gt; Into a far country.
[2:22:42] &gt;&gt; Go see three weeks you will see the
[2:22:43] quote I gave you.
[2:22:45] &gt;&gt; To a kafar country which means what?
[2:22:48] &gt;&gt; SO JESUS IS TALKING TO THEM. HE'S
[2:22:50] RECALIBRATING them
[2:22:51] &gt;&gt; that hey there was a noble there was a
[2:22:53] certain man
[2:22:55] &gt;&gt; if you look he's now putting his name
[2:22:58] &gt;&gt; because the ministry of the son of man
[2:23:00] have a tendency to remove the name
[2:23:03] &gt;&gt; and to act like you are speaking about
[2:23:05] somebody else
[2:23:07] &gt;&gt; yeah there will come a man
[2:23:09] &gt;&gt; who will restore
[2:23:10] &gt;&gt; I'm only laying the platform for him
[2:23:13] &gt;&gt; he will come AND LEAD THE BROTHER
[2:23:15] &gt;&gt; AND THEN PREACHER ARE COMING I'M THE
[2:23:17] REPLACEMENT I'M THE REPLACEMENT
[2:23:20] I'M THE THE REPLACEMENT OF WHO?
[2:23:22] &gt;&gt; THE REPLACEMENT OF WHO?
[2:23:24] &gt;&gt; THAT MAN WAS HIMSELF.
[2:23:30] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[2:23:30] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:23:31] &gt;&gt; YOU NEED TO KNOW THE MINISTRY OF THE SON
[2:23:33] OF MAN.
[2:23:34] &gt;&gt; HE WILL TELL YOU THE SON OF MAN WHO IS
[2:23:36] IN HEAVEN.
[2:23:38] &gt;&gt; AND YET THE SON OF MAN IS RIGHT HERE.
[2:23:43] &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH.
[2:23:44] &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT ME. I'M I'M ONLY UH MAYBE
[2:23:47] FORESHADOW foreshadowing who since he's
[2:23:49] dead. Who do you see?
[2:23:50] &gt;&gt; WHO DO YOU SEE?
[2:23:52] &gt;&gt; WHO DO YOU SEE DOING THE SIGN in the
[2:23:55] back?
[2:23:56] &gt;&gt; Who do you see?
[2:23:57] &gt;&gt; So who else do you expect?
[2:23:59] &gt;&gt; Are you wasting your time? Okay. A
[2:24:01] certain MAN WAS GOING TO HEAVEN.
[2:24:06] &gt;&gt; No preacher
[2:24:07] &gt;&gt; will replace brother.
[2:24:09] &gt;&gt; There is only one brother.
[2:24:12] &gt;&gt; Only seven star. There was not eight
[2:24:16] &gt;&gt; seven
[2:24:17] &gt;&gt; after seven. No more.
[2:24:22] &gt;&gt; I DON'T CARE HOW POWERFUL GOD USE YOU.
[2:24:26] [cheering]
[2:24:27] &gt;&gt; No more.
[2:24:30] &gt;&gt; Even if you take this puppet, you flip
[2:24:32] it. No more.
[2:24:36] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:24:38] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Are we together? Amen.
[2:24:40] &gt;&gt; I I can piss with something here but it
[2:24:43] will hurt hard but let me leave it
[2:24:44] alone.
[2:24:45] &gt;&gt; Even the desertment in public
[2:24:48] &gt;&gt; cannot be tempered with.
[2:24:49] &gt;&gt; I have the quote.
[2:24:51] &gt;&gt; It's only for one.
[2:24:55] &gt;&gt; It's only for one.
[2:24:58] &gt;&gt; I will get to that one day.
[2:25:00] &gt;&gt; You cannot sit here and begin you there.
[2:25:02] You there. You there.
[2:25:05] Yes. God will give you a discernment but
[2:25:07] not to that caliber.
[2:25:10] Amen.
[2:25:14] &gt;&gt; I have quote I'm loaded. I am loaded. I
[2:25:18] am loaded.
[2:25:19] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:25:21] &gt;&gt; I know when I'm saying this maybe I hit
[2:25:23] somewhere. Yes. But I don't have any
[2:25:25] choice.
[2:25:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. No, we got to put everything back
[2:25:28] in order.
[2:25:33] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:25:35] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Because when this sign
[2:25:37] happened they they are signal
[2:25:39] &gt;&gt; THEY TELL US THAT THAT MAN IS A MAN to
[2:25:42] follow. So when you doing that what do
[2:25:44] you say?
[2:25:45] &gt;&gt; We need to follow who again
[2:25:47] &gt;&gt; you [screaming]
[2:25:49] &gt;&gt; we following the message.
[2:25:52] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:25:54] &gt;&gt; Another parenthesis. Let's go my friend.
[2:25:56] &gt;&gt; HE SAY CERTAIN NOBLE MAN WENT INTO A far
[2:25:59] country to receive for himself what?
[2:26:02] &gt;&gt; A kingdom
[2:26:03] &gt;&gt; and do what?
[2:26:04] &gt;&gt; Return. SO HE WAS GOING IN heaven to
[2:26:07] receive a kingdom
[2:26:09] &gt;&gt; and then to do what?
[2:26:10] &gt;&gt; RETURN.
[2:26:11] &gt;&gt; IN OTHER WORDS, THE LEVEL HE WAS HE
[2:26:14] DIDN'T HE WAS NOT IN THE LEVEL THAT HE
[2:26:16] WAS SUPPOSED TO OPERATE.
[2:26:19] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[2:26:19] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HE CAME DOWN AS A LAMB.
[2:26:21] &gt;&gt; YES, SIR.
[2:26:23] &gt;&gt; NOT A lion yet.
[2:26:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:26:26] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:26:27] &gt;&gt; SO HE WAS GOING TO HEAVEN TO RECEIVE A
[2:26:30] KINGDOM. AMEN.
[2:26:32] &gt;&gt; IN OTHER WORDS, TO BE CROWNED
[2:26:36] &gt;&gt; AS A KING
[2:26:37] &gt;&gt; AND COME BACK.
[2:26:40] &gt;&gt; HE WAS GOING TO HEAVEN
[2:26:42] &gt;&gt; TO CHANGE.
[2:26:44] &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU GET TO HEAVEN, HE'S GOING TO
[2:26:46] CHANGE.
[2:26:48] &gt;&gt; WHEN HE'S GOING TO HEAVEN, HE WON'T BE A
[2:26:50] LAMB. BUT WHEN HE GET TO HEAVEN, HE WILL
[2:26:53] CHANGE AND BECOME A LION. SO WHEN HE'S
[2:26:57] COMING BACK, HE'S RETURNING WITH A LION
[2:27:01] KINGDOM.
[2:27:06] &gt;&gt; I TOLD YOU THIS AIRPLANE FLIPS.
[2:27:09] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:27:10] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:27:12] &gt;&gt; He was a king, BUT HE WAS NEVER
[2:27:14] RECOGNIZED as a king.
[2:27:15] &gt;&gt; He was only walking with disciple.
[2:27:18] &gt;&gt; A king don't walk with small people like
[2:27:20] that.
[2:27:20] &gt;&gt; Are we together? BUT WHEN HE'S COMING
[2:27:23] BACK IN THE BOOK OF REVELATION 19,
[2:27:26] &gt;&gt; HE'S KING OF KINGS.
[2:27:28] &gt;&gt; HE'S LORD OF LORD.
[2:27:29] &gt;&gt; HE'S COMING WITH A SWORD
[2:27:32] &gt;&gt; ON A WHITE HORSE. [screaming]
[2:27:34] &gt;&gt; THAT IS THE KING. [cheering]
[2:27:36] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together.
[2:27:38] &gt;&gt; I HOPE WE ARE TOGETHER.
[2:27:40] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. IN OTHER WORDS,
[2:27:42] JESUS IS TELLING THEM, I'M GOING TO
[2:27:44] LEAVE.
[2:27:45] &gt;&gt; I'M GOING TO GO TO HEAVEN
[2:27:47] &gt;&gt; AND I'M GOING TO IMORPH OVER THERE. WHEN
[2:27:50] I IMMOR
[2:27:54] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE BIBLE SAY, "BEHOLD THE LION
[2:27:56] OF THE TRIBE OF JUDAH."
[2:27:58] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? WHEN I COME BACK, I
[2:28:00] WILL COME BACK AS A KING.
[2:28:03] &gt;&gt; SO HIS RETURN IS A RETURN OF A KING.
[2:28:09] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:28:11] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[2:28:13] &gt;&gt; ARE WE HAVE I LOST SOMEBODY?
[2:28:15] &gt;&gt; BEEN WE OKAY?
[2:28:18] &gt;&gt; OKAY, let's go, my friend. Where are we
[2:28:19] at?
[2:28:20] &gt;&gt; Verse 12.
[2:28:21] &gt;&gt; VERSE 12. HE SAYS, "THEREFORE, A CERTAIN
[2:28:24] NOBLE MAN WENT INTO A far country to
[2:28:27] receive for himself water,
[2:28:28] &gt;&gt; the kingdom
[2:28:29] &gt;&gt; and water
[2:28:30] &gt;&gt; to return."
[2:28:30] &gt;&gt; So he was going to return.
[2:28:32] &gt;&gt; In other words, he's telling the Jews,
[2:28:35] &gt;&gt; I'm not going to take kingdom. Now
[2:28:37] &gt;&gt; I still have to go to heaven.
[2:28:40] &gt;&gt; WHEN I WILL COME BACK FROM HEAVEN,
[2:28:42] &gt;&gt; this is when I'm going to be king.
[2:28:45] &gt;&gt; The way you are operating, the way you
[2:28:47] are expecting. Amen.
[2:28:48] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:28:50] &gt;&gt; SO THERE IS A PERIOD OF time
[2:28:55] &gt;&gt; between the going away,
[2:28:59] &gt;&gt; the going away of this noble man
[2:29:04] &gt;&gt; OR THE DEPARTURE
[2:29:06] &gt;&gt; OF THIS NOBLE man until his return.
[2:29:11] THERE IS A SEASON RIGHT HERE
[2:29:14] [music]
[2:29:15] &gt;&gt; WHERE THE NOBLEMAN WILL BE ABSENT
[2:29:20] &gt;&gt; ABSENT PHYSICALLY
[2:29:26] &gt;&gt; A LITTLE MORE AND THE WORLD WILL SEE ME
[2:29:29] NO MORE.
[2:29:32] &gt;&gt; PLEASE, it's quiet over here.
[2:29:36] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:29:37] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? A LITTLE WHILE AND THE
[2:29:40] WORLD WILL SEE ME NO MORE BUT YOU WILL
[2:29:42] SEE ME
[2:29:44] &gt;&gt; AND I BECAUSE I WILL BE where
[2:29:50] &gt;&gt; are we together?
[2:29:52] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:29:53] &gt;&gt; Oh Lord help me.
[2:29:55] &gt;&gt; Where are we at my friend?
[2:29:57] &gt;&gt; Verse 13.
[2:29:58] &gt;&gt; AND HE CALLED WHAT?
[2:29:59] &gt;&gt; His 10 servants.
[2:30:00] &gt;&gt; He called how many servants?
[2:30:02] &gt;&gt; 10.
[2:30:03] &gt;&gt; How many servant?
[2:30:04] &gt;&gt; 10. My friend, let's do better so we can
[2:30:07] finish this
[2:30:08] &gt;&gt; because if not we will cut this short.
[2:30:12] &gt;&gt; How many servant?
[2:30:13] &gt;&gt; 10.
[2:30:13] &gt;&gt; 10 servant.
[2:30:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:30:20] &gt;&gt; He called 10 servant AND DELIVER UNTO
[2:30:24] them what?
[2:30:25] &gt;&gt; 10 pound.
[2:30:26] &gt;&gt; 10 pound and say to them do what?
[2:30:29] &gt;&gt; OCCUPY TILL I. SO BEFORE HE leaves
[2:30:34] &gt;&gt; to go TO HEAVEN,
[2:30:35] &gt;&gt; HE WOULD TAKE £10.
[2:30:39] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:30:40] &gt;&gt; So £10
[2:30:45] &gt;&gt; is his fullness now.
[2:30:48] &gt;&gt; This is all he has right now.
[2:30:51] &gt;&gt; All he pull up
[2:30:53] &gt;&gt; is£10.
[2:30:54] &gt;&gt; Are we together? And he's going to
[2:30:57] deliver£10
[2:30:58] &gt;&gt; before he leaves.
[2:31:00] &gt;&gt; AND ONCE THE£10 ARE DELIVERED,
[2:31:03] &gt;&gt; he leaves
[2:31:05] &gt;&gt; toward the far country.
[2:31:07] &gt;&gt; SO WHEN JESUS IS GOING TO HEAVEN, he's
[2:31:09] leaving something.
[2:31:14] &gt;&gt; AND HOW MANY POUND IS HE LIVING?
[2:31:17] &gt;&gt; HOW MANY SERVANT IS HE LIVING? SO EVERY
[2:31:20] SERVANT HAVE HOW MANY POUND?
[2:31:25] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:31:26] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:31:28] &gt;&gt; When he GAVE THE 10, HE SAYS DO WHAT?
[2:31:32] &gt;&gt; OCCUPY.
[2:31:33] &gt;&gt; IN OTHER WORDS, GET TO BUSINESS.
[2:31:37] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[2:31:38] &gt;&gt; SO THE SERVANT HAD TO ENTER THE BUSINESS
[2:31:42] OF THE NOBLE MEN.
[2:31:47] &gt;&gt; AMEN. HE WAS NOT ANY KIND OF BUSINESS.
[2:31:49] &gt;&gt; THE BUSINESS OF THE FATHER.
[2:31:52] &gt;&gt; HE LEFT THE BUSINESS.
[2:31:55] &gt;&gt; HE TOOK HIS BUSINESS
[2:31:57] &gt;&gt; AND GAVE IT TO 10 PEOPLE.
[2:31:59] &gt;&gt; AND THE 10 PEOPLE HAVE TO CONTINUE
[2:32:03] &gt;&gt; HIS BUSINESS WHEN HE'S AWAY.
[2:32:11] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:32:12] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER?
[2:32:14] THIS 10 HERE WHEN WE SPEAK £10 IN
[2:32:18] AMERICAN ENGLISH IT'S A PROBLEM.
[2:32:21] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:32:22] &gt;&gt; BECAUSE WE THINK IT'S£10 OF CHICKEN.
[2:32:28] &gt;&gt; OH, IT'S£10 of milk
[2:32:30] &gt;&gt; or gallon OR WHATEVER POUND OR 10 POUND
[2:32:33] OF RICE.
[2:32:35] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? BUT THAT'S NOT THE
[2:32:37] POUND THAT YOU'RE THINKING OF.
[2:32:39] &gt;&gt; THIS POUND IS MONEY.
[2:32:46] You start again.
[2:32:53] &gt;&gt; Some of you are I already gave you so
[2:32:56] many quote but you still some of you are
[2:32:58] still struggle. Let's see jump to verse
[2:33:00] 20. So we clear that.
[2:33:02] &gt;&gt; And another came saying, "What?
[2:33:05] &gt;&gt; Behold,
[2:33:05] &gt;&gt; behold, here is what
[2:33:07] &gt;&gt; thy pound
[2:33:08] &gt;&gt; which I have water
[2:33:09] &gt;&gt; kept laid up in the napkin.
[2:33:11] &gt;&gt; For I fear you because you are a water,
[2:33:13] &gt;&gt; an austere man.
[2:33:14] &gt;&gt; And you didn't and you take up that you
[2:33:16] have water
[2:33:17] &gt;&gt; lay not down
[2:33:18] &gt;&gt; reap that you did not water."
[2:33:19] &gt;&gt; So
[2:33:20] &gt;&gt; he was showing the master a pound,
[2:33:23] &gt;&gt; his pound, right? Because he was only
[2:33:25] one pound given to everybody.
[2:33:27] &gt;&gt; Verse 22. And he says to him, "Out of
[2:33:30] your mouth will I judge you, you who
[2:33:32] &gt;&gt; wicked servant.
[2:33:33] &gt;&gt; You knew that I was a what?
[2:33:35] &gt;&gt; Austere man,
[2:33:36] &gt;&gt; a severe man, a strict man, taking up
[2:33:38] and laid h that I laid not and doing
[2:33:41] what?
[2:33:42] &gt;&gt; Reaping that I did not."
[2:33:43] &gt;&gt; Wherefore then gave not you my pound?
[2:33:46] &gt;&gt; My money.
[2:33:47] &gt;&gt; My what?
[2:33:48] &gt;&gt; Money.
[2:33:48] &gt;&gt; So pound is what?
[2:33:50] &gt;&gt; Money.
[2:33:50] &gt;&gt; Pound means what?
[2:33:52] &gt;&gt; Money.
[2:33:52] &gt;&gt; We clear now?
[2:33:53] &gt;&gt; So this 10 pound means 10. He He took
[2:33:57] money and gave it to somebody.
[2:33:59] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:34:01] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:34:02] &gt;&gt; What is money?
[2:34:07] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:34:08] &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? BROTHER BRANDHAM SAY
[2:34:12] THEN HE HAD A LITTLE SCRIPT BAG. TALKING
[2:34:15] ABOUT DAVID.
[2:34:16] &gt;&gt; AND NOT ONLY THAT, BUT THE SCRIPT bag
[2:34:18] really in what?
[2:34:20] &gt;&gt; ONE POCKET.
[2:34:21] &gt;&gt; IN ONE POCKET of it CARRIES WATER,
[2:34:24] &gt;&gt; MONEY. THE WORD SCRIPT means what?
[2:34:27] &gt;&gt; MONEY.
[2:34:28] &gt;&gt; SO HE CARRIES WHAT?
[2:34:30] &gt;&gt; Money in there.
