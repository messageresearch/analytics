[34:13] refereed them brother kelly
[34:15] and we stopped in resident then we went
[34:17] to the black dog territory because the
[34:20] lord want to clean you up
[34:26] amen
[34:27] we started with the unchanging pattern
[34:29] of god right
[34:30] we laid the foundation for malachi 4
[34:33] then we started with the book of esther
[34:35] and stop and went to roof and stop and
[34:38] when to the black dog god every time god
[34:41] bring a message to you
[34:44] if you very
[34:46] careful about it in that message there
[34:49] is a power to deliver you
[34:53] did you get that
[34:54] if god preached to you about the high
[34:56] heel
[34:57] automatically there is power in that
[34:59] message to deliver you because before
[35:02] you didn't know it was bad
[35:04] now when the lord is coming it's like a
[35:06] light that is shining and showing you
[35:09] the imperfection
[35:10] when you see it
[35:12] if you just take it and apply it god
[35:14] will back you up and get that stuff out
[35:16] of your life
[35:17] amen but if you don't then that grace is
[35:21] passing
[35:22] and he's moving again picking up
[35:24] somebody else amen that's why you see we
[35:27] going through a direction we stop and we
[35:29] drop into something and he went through
[35:31] the type of love and smoking and
[35:34] cigarette i mean cigarette and drinking
[35:37] all the stuff we went through it was
[35:39] just the holy ghost cleaning the church
[35:42] up of everything amen but some of you
[35:45] didn't get clean up
[35:48] amen
[35:49] so he comes back again and because he
[35:51] wanted to take one of her sister home
[35:54] did you see what he did he began to
[35:56] preach about the first death the second
[35:58] death the mystery of death and position
[36:00] the church and when the sister is taken
[36:02] out the pen is not too strong
[36:05] and he stabilized the church then he
[36:07] move up and he goes again a different
[36:08] way that's the wisdom of the holy spirit
[36:11] he have nothing to do with me amen
[36:15] but what is important and i promise to
[36:19] enter this and i saw it in the
[36:20] tabernacle
[36:25] god spoke to us about our origin
[36:29] amen
[36:31] origin is good
[36:32] because you gotta know where you come
[36:34] from
[36:35] amen
[36:36] if you a pope
[36:39] in this world
[36:41] you came straight from hell
[36:45] i can prove to you by the scripture
[36:49] amen there's no way you can be a child
[36:51] of god period that's it amen
[36:54] so there is you must know where you come
[36:57] from
[36:58] you got to know if you coming from god
[37:01] or if you're coming from hell because
[37:03] they are the children of god you
[37:05] remember and they are also children of
[37:07] the devil so knowing that is very
[37:09] important because it takes the anxiety
[37:12] off of you first
[37:14] so the devil won't be playing with your
[37:15] mind amen but the next step is the one
[37:19] that is very very important you already
[37:22] know you're a child of god
[37:24] that's okay
[37:26] praise god
[37:27] the next question is where are you in
[37:30] your work with god
[37:32] that's where the tabernacle now is gonna
[37:35] unfold you where you are
[37:37] amen you must know where you are
[37:41] this have nothing to do with how many
[37:43] years you're in the message
[37:46] anybody here
[37:47] anybody here because if you're in the
[37:49] message for 20 years and you are still
[37:52] cussing
[37:55] you don't have the holy ghost
[37:58] anybody care
[38:00] i don't care how many people told you
[38:02] you have the holy ghost you don't have
[38:04] the holy ghost i'm not saying you are
[38:06] not a child of god
[38:09] did you get me
[38:11] i'm not saying you don't have you are
[38:12] not the child of god you are a child of
[38:15] god but the problem is you are in a step
[38:18] that you do not understand this is the
[38:20] problem all along in the message that's
[38:22] why people struggle in the message for
[38:25] years because you don't know where you
[38:28] are
[38:30] anybody care
[38:32] is fever something good
[38:36] one way fever is bad
[38:38] one-way fever is good
[38:40] it depends on where you know or how you
[38:43] look in it
[38:44] we don't want fever but fever is just
[38:46] something telling you something is wrong
[38:49] anybody care
[38:50] everybody
[38:51] if not you will continue to take tylenol
[38:55] and motrin but you don't solve the
[38:57] problem
[38:58] did you hear me did you get what i'm
[39:00] trying to say amen
[39:03] if you look at fever as something that
[39:05] is bad
[39:06] you will go for motion and take motion
[39:10] and take spiritual tylenol
[39:13] and you're going to feel better a while
[39:16] and then after a while the fever will
[39:19] come back again
[39:21] you hear me
[39:22] that's why you feel better in church
[39:25] and after a while you see the habit pop
[39:27] up back again
[39:29] after a while in other words your life
[39:31] is going up and down
[39:33] everybody care
[39:35] someday you feel like ah i really gather
[39:38] i have the anointing i feel good
[39:40] after two three months you down again
[39:44] and you see the old stuff keep coming
[39:45] back up again
[39:47] you don't understand and the devil
[39:49] likes it because the people don't
[39:52] understand where they are keep thinking
[39:54] you're a child of god and you keep
[39:56] spitting yourself around amen
[39:58] amen
[40:00] so if you understand that fever is just
[40:03] a sign
[40:05] telling you that something is wrong in
[40:07] your body
[40:09] then you on different road then it's
[40:12] going to take you to the hospital
[40:14] and they're going to diagnose what it is
[40:16] and give you the appropriate medication
[40:19] probably you don't even need much
[40:21] tylenol because you can damage your
[40:23] liver but if you take some antibiotics
[40:26] straight ahead you can solve the problem
[40:28] did it make sense
[40:29] you see what i'm trying to say so you
[40:32] can be in this message for five years 10
[40:35] years 15 years and your life doesn't
[40:38] change
[40:40] anybody care
[40:42] you are a child of god but you're not
[40:44] progressing
[40:46] everybody
[40:47] a habit is lingering in your life for 10
[40:50] years
[40:51] something is wrong
[40:53] everybody
[40:54] the station of god the way god plays his
[40:57] station
[40:58] those stations have deliverance
[41:01] if you reach the first station it's
[41:04] going to do something in your life then
[41:06] you gotta leave that station quickly
[41:09] and move to the second one if you don't
[41:11] move to the second one you're gonna stay
[41:14] there for 25 years in the message and
[41:16] the message became a religion
[41:19] everybody
[41:20] that's why you see people going to
[41:22] church in the message coming back but
[41:24] there is no difference between them and
[41:26] somebody who doesn't believe the message
[41:29] the only difference is they don't drink
[41:34] don't smoke
[41:35] but if you check their life there is no
[41:37] difference
[41:38] yet they're in the message
[41:40] but you cannot be satisfied if you don't
[41:43] see the supernatural in your life
[41:47] do you hear me
[41:48] you hear me
[41:49] don't be satisfied to hear god talk to
[41:52] abraham
[41:54] god must talk to you
[41:56] you must walk up someday in the morning
[41:59] and say okay that god is real
[42:02] i heard him talking to me
[42:05] not talking to joseph that's fine not
[42:07] talking to david that's fine that god
[42:10] must speak to you personally
[42:13] not somebody telling you the lord told
[42:16] me to tell you
[42:17] you and god talking
[42:20] amen
[42:21] you need that
[42:23] if not you are just presuming
[42:27] and when trials come you back again to
[42:30] where you came from
[42:31] and then before you know it it's a
[42:33] depression
[42:34] it seems like you have to be in church
[42:36] all the time
[42:38] to be maintaining a certain atmosphere
[42:42] so try to stay in church for the next
[42:47] one month
[42:48] amen
[42:49] so we will show you where you are
[42:53] not me the holy ghost will show you
[42:55] where you are
[42:57] and then from there you will try to find
[42:59] out where should i be
[43:01] amen
[43:02] and then your life will change
[43:04] anybody care
[43:06] we cannot continue with you spinning
[43:08] around
[43:10] it's not going to help you amen
[43:12] when trial comes you down and then
[43:14] tomorrow you happy then you down then
[43:16] you happy then you die then it becomes
[43:18] like a habit like a episode in your life
[43:21] no something is wrong
[43:23] amen you have not detected or decoded
[43:27] the sounds very good you are giving
[43:30] tylenol
[43:31] and motion it's not helping
[43:34] you need to know who you are
[43:36] you need to know where you are in your
[43:39] work are you in step one
[43:41] or step two or step three or step four
[43:45] if you on one then you gotta wake up
[43:49] so don't fool yourself if you on one
[43:51] don't fool yourself you got the holy
[43:52] ghost
[43:54] don't fool yourself
[43:56] just acknowledge i don't have the holy
[43:57] ghost then you stop pushing everybody
[44:00] here
[44:00] the problem is we are one and we say i
[44:02] have the holy ghost i have it praise the
[44:04] lord your life is proving to you that
[44:06] you don't have it
[44:09] everybody here
[44:10] fruit is fruit
[44:12] when they look at fruit it's fruit they
[44:14] don't manufacture them it's there if you
[44:16] don't have it it means that life is not
[44:18] there it's it's easy
[44:22] everybody did that burst your bible
[44:26] amen
[44:28] it is god bringing deliverance to you
[44:31] everybody remember
[44:32] so remember this it's not something to
[44:35] condemn you it is the grace of god
[44:38] that is trying to show you where you are
[44:42] because the hour is late
[44:44] so we can get our life line up together
[44:48] and we can be ready for the rapture
[44:50] you don't want to be caught off guard
[44:53] thinking you were right when you are not
[44:56] gift and calling are without repentance
[45:00] anybody care
[45:01] you follow your gift you might be not
[45:03] having the holy ghost and you're going
[45:04] to get lost
[45:06] everybody care we want you to have your
[45:08] gift but we want you to know for sure
[45:11] whether you have the holy ghost or not
[45:14] and if you have the holy ghost where are
[45:15] you what are you supposed to do which
[45:18] station do you have to move in the
[45:20] tabernacle
[45:22] amen
[45:23] i'm thinking to you this is serious
[45:26] have peter walk in the water
[45:30] pee the walk in the water
[45:32] did he have the holy ghost
[45:37] you didn't answer
[45:38] did he have the holy ghost
[45:41] go to a pentecostal who walk in water
[45:43] tell him you don't have the holy ghost
[45:48] he's not going to believe you he will
[45:50] say i have the holy ghost look at the
[45:52] lord walking with me on the water
[45:54] but peter walked on the water without
[45:56] the holy ghost
[45:58] until jesus looked at him and say when
[46:01] you get converted
[46:04] did
[46:04] did peter preach the gospel
[46:09] you need to read your bible did peter
[46:11] preach the gospel
[46:13] how can jesus tell him to be converted
[46:16] he was already a minister
[46:20] you see now
[46:21] you see now
[46:23] you see now
[46:24] so standing on the pulpit is not enough
[46:27] anybody care
[46:28] you got to know where you are with the
[46:31] lord
[46:32] until you come out from the upper room
[46:35] like peter then it's a different peter
[46:39] amen then peter is willing to die for
[46:42] the lord jesus christ
[46:44] everybody here because peter preached
[46:46] the gospel
[46:48] peter prayed for the sick people they
[46:50] got healed peter walked on the water
[46:53] but when they put pressure on him are
[46:56] you the one identify with this message
[46:59] of the hour
[47:03] do you know what peter did the bible say
[47:05] he even curse
[47:07] i have the scripture if you want to
[47:11] why because when the showdown comes your
[47:14] color will show up telling you that
[47:17] peter you another it took brother
[47:19] branham to unfold all the disciples
[47:22] stages brother branham opened them all
[47:24] up like this that's why we need a
[47:25] prophet brother branham came and say all
[47:27] of them were in this stage
[47:29] that's the reason why they were all
[47:31] struggling
[47:33] when they came to arrest jesus christ
[47:35] who stood with jesus christ
[47:39] you see now
[47:42] you don't want people to come to this
[47:44] message and you don't want to stand for
[47:45] the message
[47:47] you see why
[47:48] we need to get closer with god sorry i
[47:51] took some time it's a preview to prepare
[47:54] you to pray
[47:56] to listen to the word
[47:58] to get ready so the lord can bring a
[48:01] deliverance and
[48:03] get a get you from one to two whoever is
[48:06] in two to three whoever is in three to
[48:09] four amen let's sing only believe

[51:08] amen
[51:09] we're counting on that
[51:12] amen
[51:13] i bet you'll be seated just for a minute
[51:15] before we read the scripture
[51:17] i just want to thank brother polycarp
[51:19] for that wonderful message
[51:21] going beyond the camp
[51:23] going beyond the camp brother seth i'm
[51:25] not going to try to sing
[51:26] tonight
[51:28] if i was i'd ask for your help
[51:31] i i won't i won't try to sing while my
[51:33] brother says
[51:35] we certainly do appreciate our musicians
[51:37] don't we amen
[51:39] and our singers
[51:42] that zade is a wonderful singer so many
[51:44] good singers so much talent
[51:47] amongst the bride of jesus christ
[51:50] and we're so glad that we're part of
[51:52] this great family that god has allowed
[51:54] us to be but i i was so impressed with
[51:56] that message that brother polycarp
[51:58] brought the other day i wanted to read
[51:59] this quote
[52:01] out of going beyond the camp
[52:03] and it's in it's on paragraph 48
[52:06] he said you know i was told some time
[52:08] ago
[52:09] that they had a jet plane now
[52:12] that can
[52:13] make them noises where we hear around
[52:15] here that shakes windows
[52:19] it's when the plane has got so fast
[52:22] that it crosses its own sound called the
[52:25] sound barrier
[52:27] you're familiar with that brother
[52:28] polycarp
[52:29] yes amen
[52:31] and when it goes beyond the sound
[52:33] barrier it's almost unlimited
[52:37] to what it'll do
[52:40] and he said and i think in there
[52:43] that we get a great lesson
[52:47] when we go beyond our own sound barrier
[52:51] into the word of god
[52:53] then it's unlimited
[52:56] what god can do
[52:58] with a man that's ready to go beyond the
[53:02] camp
[53:03] the camp of man that is
[53:06] now we see
[53:07] that
[53:08] going beyond the camp
[53:10] going beyond
[53:12] this oh how i do appreciate
[53:16] that message that our brother brought
[53:18] i've i've feasted on it for a long time
[53:20] i've always liked that message going
[53:22] beyond the camp you go beyond the camp
[53:25] of your reasoning you go beyond the camp
[53:27] of your imaginations of your memories of
[53:30] your affections of what you can see what
[53:33] you can feel what you can taste and now
[53:36] you understand what you're doing when
[53:37] you're going beyond the camp of what you
[53:40] can do you're entering into the camp of
[53:42] what he can do
[53:44] and that's where we want to get to it's
[53:46] not about us it's about what jesus
[53:50] christ can do
[53:51] when we as a body of jesus christ
[53:54] completely yield ourselves and we're no
[53:58] longer living by what our five senses
[54:00] tell us whether to be the five senses of
[54:02] the flesh or the five senses of the
[54:05] spirit
[54:07] amen amen and we sure do appreciate uh
[54:10] the lord jesus and i'd like to speak
[54:12] tonight on a message that the lord put
[54:14] on my heart
[54:15] the tender hand of jehovah
[54:18] the tender
[54:23] now if you think you know what a tender
[54:25] hand is
[54:26] we're about to get educated
[54:29] the tender hand of jehovah and for a
[54:32] subtitle i like to use this
[54:34] perfect faith
[54:36] in perfect love
[54:40] the tender hand of jehovah
[54:42] and we're talking about perfect faith
[54:45] in
[54:46] perfect love
[54:48] it's one thing to know god know all
[54:51] about god but if you don't have faith in
[54:55] god it will profit you nothing
[54:58] let's turn in our bibles if we could
[55:00] stand just for a minute to hebrews
[55:02] chapter 3 and verse
[55:05] 12
[55:07] hebrews chapter 3 and verse 12.
[55:13] if you're there say amen
[55:18] give just another minute or two
[55:20] i like brother steve because he likes
[55:22] for his audience to be where he's at
[55:25] caught up
[55:27] he wants them to understand what's being
[55:29] said
[55:30] and the message is clear
[55:32] and our god is no mumble jumble he says
[55:36] what he means
[55:38] and he means what he says
[55:40] and because that he says what he means
[55:44] and he means what he says
[55:46] it's easy for believers to have faith in
[55:50] god
[55:52] and the reason that people don't have
[55:54] faith in god is because truly they are
[55:58] not believers let's see what this
[55:59] example is before us here and uh hebrews
[56:02] everybody hebrews chapter 3 and verse
[56:05] 12.
[56:06] he says take heed brethren
[56:10] lest there be any of you
[56:13] lest there be in any of you an evil
[56:16] heart of unbelief
[56:18] unbelief is the worst disease a human
[56:21] being can have
[56:22] it's worse than leprosy
[56:26] excuse me
[56:30] oh you're wasting your time
[56:33] praise the lord
[56:35] take heed brethren lest there be in any
[56:37] of you an evil heart of unbelief
[56:41] in departing from the living god
[56:45] but exhort one another daily
[56:49] while it is called today
[56:52] lest any of you be hardened through the
[56:54] deceitfulness of sin
[56:56] for we are made partakers of christ if
[57:01] if's a big word
[57:03] it's only two letters but it's a big
[57:05] word
[57:06] we are made partakers of christ if we
[57:10] hold the beginning of our confidence
[57:13] steadfast unto the end
[57:16] now that word confidence is a very same
[57:19] word as faith if you have confidence in
[57:21] something you have faith in something
[57:24] and so what he's saying if we are made
[57:26] partakers of christ if we hold the
[57:29] beginning of our faith steadfast to the
[57:32] end while it is said today
[57:35] if you will hear his voice
[57:38] and remember hear the voice doesn't just
[57:40] mean that you hear it with your ears it
[57:42] means that you understand what the voice
[57:45] said
[57:47] and when you understand it and then you
[57:49] believe it that means that you have
[57:52] faith in it and you watch where all the
[57:54] doubt will go when you simply can take
[57:57] god at his word
[58:00] harden out your heart as in the
[58:02] provocation
[58:04] for some when they heard did provoke how
[58:08] be it not all that came out of egypt by
[58:10] moses
[58:12] but with whom he was grieved forty years
[58:15] was it not
[58:17] with them that had sinned whose carcass
[58:21] carcasses fell in the wilderness and to
[58:24] whom swear he that they should not
[58:28] enter into his rest
[58:30] but to them that believe not
[58:33] so we see
[58:34] that they could not enter in
[58:37] because of unbelief
[58:41] all right here we go verse chapter 4
[58:44] let us therefore fear
[58:48] lest a promise being left us of entering
[58:51] into his rest
[58:53] his rest any of you should seem to come
[58:56] short of it for unto us was the gospel
[58:59] preached
[59:01] as well as unto them they had the gospel
[59:04] preached to him
[59:06] what was the problem they didn't hold
[59:09] their confidence steadfast to the end
[59:13] and when the trials came the heartaches
[59:16] came the sorrows came they didn't know
[59:18] the tender hand of jehovah was just
[59:21] leading them to the promised land
[59:23] and therefore they fainted in the way
[59:25] and because of that god was not pleased
[59:28] we're going to get into it in a minute
[59:29] for unto us was the gospel preached as
[59:32] well as unto them but the word preached
[59:36] did not profit them not being mixed with
[59:39] faith in them that heard it
[59:43] amen let's turn if we could over to um
[59:47] uh ephesians chapter 4 again
[59:49] i like the book of ephesians you know
[59:52] brother branham said that uh ephesians
[59:54] parallels joshua
[59:56] ephesians chapter four
[1:00:00] we know that faith comes by
[1:00:03] and hearing the
[1:00:05] and how can we hear without a
[1:00:08] and how can a preacher preach except he
[1:00:10] be
[1:00:11] oh we got bible readers here today amen
[1:00:14] i like that so now let's go over to
[1:00:16] hebrews chapter 4 and we're going to
[1:00:18] pick it up in verse 11 again
[1:00:22] and let's just see the gifts that god
[1:00:24] gave
[1:00:25] see because i just see in this message
[1:00:28] that there that people want to eliminate
[1:00:31] the word you cannot take one word out of
[1:00:35] the book
[1:00:37] all the words he said if you take one
[1:00:39] word out of the book he said your name
[1:00:41] will be taken out of the book of life if
[1:00:43] you add one word to the book he said the
[1:00:46] plagues that are in the book will be
[1:00:47] added unto you so we cannot shine light
[1:00:50] on
[1:00:51] on malachi 4 and not shine light on
[1:00:54] ephesians 4
[1:00:56] they work hand in hand
[1:00:58] amen
[1:01:01] and he gave some apostles
[1:01:03] and some prophets
[1:01:05] and some evangelists and some pastors
[1:01:09] and teachers
[1:01:12] for the perfecting of the saints
[1:01:16] for the work of the ministry
[1:01:19] for the edifying of the body of christ
[1:01:23] till we all come in the unity of the
[1:01:27] faith
[1:01:29] are we in the unity of the faith
[1:01:32] all
[1:01:33] in the unity of the faith
[1:01:36] we're not quitting until they we all go
[1:01:39] we're not leaving one hoof behind we're
[1:01:41] not leaving one child behind we're not
[1:01:43] leaving our sisters behind we're not
[1:01:45] leaving our brothers behind we are going
[1:01:47] to edify each other we're going to build
[1:01:49] each other up until we all come in the
[1:01:51] unity of the faith and watch this
[1:01:54] this is where we're coming to right now
[1:01:57] i'll come in the unity of the faith unto
[1:01:59] end of the knowledge of the son of man
[1:02:02] unto a perfect man
[1:02:04] unto the measure of the stature of the
[1:02:08] fullness of christ
[1:02:10] that we henceforth brother stephen
[1:02:13] are no more
[1:02:15] children
[1:02:16] tossed to and fro
[1:02:18] and carried about with every wind of
[1:02:20] doctrine by the slight of men and
[1:02:23] cunning craftiness whereby they lie and
[1:02:27] wait to deceive but speaking the truth
[1:02:31] in love
[1:02:32] now what do we have we've got perfect
[1:02:34] faith
[1:02:35] in perfect love
[1:02:38] and that perfect faith and perfect love
[1:02:41] will always bear the perfect fruit of
[1:02:44] the spirit and it's by your fruit that
[1:02:47] jesus said that they would know you it's
[1:02:50] not by what you think you know it's by
[1:02:52] the fruit that you bear
[1:02:54] let's just pray
[1:02:56] lord jesus now we have done all that we
[1:02:59] can do father we've spent time lord
[1:03:02] today in your presence lord and we just
[1:03:04] feel like you have a message something
[1:03:06] that you want to say to the people
[1:03:09] tonight and father now we just ask you
[1:03:11] lord that you allow us to step aside to
[1:03:14] get out of the way and to allow you lord
[1:03:17] jesus to to help us to come in behind
[1:03:20] the veil let the curtain drop behind us
[1:03:22] lord god and may we just feast on the on
[1:03:26] the ever present word water from the
[1:03:28] rock we ask it in jesus christ's name
[1:03:32] amen god bless you you can be seated
[1:03:36] amen let's talk about the tender hand of
[1:03:39] jehovah
[1:03:40] the tender hand of jehovah in a message
[1:03:43] called the third exodus
[1:03:45] on paragraph 45
[1:03:47] brother branham uses this term the
[1:03:50] tender hand of jehovah but when i first
[1:03:53] read it brother uh stephen it just shook
[1:03:55] me i thought wow
[1:03:57] who could ever look at the holocaust and
[1:04:00] call it the tender
[1:04:02] hand of jehovah but that prophet knew
[1:04:06] exactly what he was talking about
[1:04:09] and and he was able to bring it into
[1:04:11] such a light that that you could look at
[1:04:14] it and you could say i was in i was in
[1:04:16] germany and when we were in germany
[1:04:18] sister teresa and i had a chance to go
[1:04:20] to dachau and daca was one of the
[1:04:22] concentration camps where they burned so
[1:04:24] many bodies of the jews that they
[1:04:27] couldn't burn them fast enough they just
[1:04:29] kept piling up and they couldn't burn
[1:04:31] them fast enough and it's a horrible as
[1:04:33] you walk into the gates of dachau even
[1:04:37] to this time now they burnt all the
[1:04:38] barracks down to the ground and the only
[1:04:41] thing that they have left on there is
[1:04:43] the uh is the foundations where the
[1:04:45] barracks were at and where and they they
[1:04:47] still have the ovens there where that
[1:04:49] they burned these bodies of
[1:04:52] of these jewish and why just because
[1:04:56] they were jews
[1:04:57] just because they were jews and you say
[1:05:00] well how then can let's read this quote
[1:05:02] here he says as it was in germany
[1:05:05] and in up into russia
[1:05:08] and italy and the people raised up
[1:05:11] josephson hitler and stalin and
[1:05:13] mussolini who hated the jews
[1:05:18] they had to go back to their homeland
[1:05:21] god
[1:05:22] yes
[1:05:23] got ways of doing things
[1:05:27] that we don't understand
[1:05:29] and you press them
[1:05:31] no home in germany everything taken away
[1:05:34] from them
[1:05:35] and let me just clue the you clue this
[1:05:37] into it happened overnight
[1:05:40] it happened almost instantaneously they
[1:05:43] were living their everyday lives yes
[1:05:45] there was pressure coming pressure
[1:05:47] coming pressure but when the actual
[1:05:50] hammer fell as it were it was the night
[1:05:52] of broken glass and it was brown shirts
[1:05:55] nazi brown shirts that was going through
[1:05:57] the cities breaking glass out of store
[1:06:00] windows they turned around and blamed it
[1:06:02] on the jews and then god got the jews up
[1:06:04] in the middle of the night and made them
[1:06:06] walk even barefooted across the broken
[1:06:09] glass and blamed them the jews for what
[1:06:12] had happened that night and the jews had
[1:06:14] nothing to do with it
[1:06:16] so the thing of it is when satan springs
[1:06:18] his trap he springs it very quickly and
[1:06:22] we who have our eyes on the word of god
[1:06:25] will not be caught unawares
[1:06:28] but people that are just lingering
[1:06:30] around lingering around waiting for for
[1:06:33] for noah to get into the ark
[1:06:35] and then they they stayed on the outside
[1:06:37] so well the ark hasn't left yet the rain
[1:06:39] doesn't come and they just waited on the
[1:06:40] outside
[1:06:43] but they didn't realize god shut the
[1:06:44] door there was no more way back in
[1:06:49] that's the way satan does it every time
[1:06:51] and so now he says you press them no
[1:06:54] home in germany everything taken away
[1:06:56] also in italy and russia no place to go
[1:07:00] and they were sent back to their
[1:07:01] homeland just
[1:07:03] to fulfill the word
[1:07:05] oh brother branham says the loving hand
[1:07:08] of god
[1:07:10] how sometimes
[1:07:12] it looks cruel
[1:07:15] of the way people suffer
[1:07:18] but it's still
[1:07:20] it's the tender hand of jehovah
[1:07:24] leading his children
[1:07:26] we thank you lord
[1:07:30] amen
[1:07:31] see
[1:07:32] we have to be children of understanding
[1:07:37] and faith comes by hearing hearing the
[1:07:39] word god did not send us the gifts that
[1:07:42] he sent us in this church
[1:07:44] just for us to sit back in our laurels
[1:07:46] and say we're christians i don't want to
[1:07:49] look like a christian walk like a
[1:07:50] christian talk like a christian that's
[1:07:52] not my goal
[1:07:54] i want to die i want everything about me
[1:07:57] to be dead and i want jesus christ to
[1:08:00] resurrect the literal life of jesus
[1:08:02] christ to come into my body possess my
[1:08:05] body and live himself out through me
[1:08:09] i don't want to be religious i don't
[1:08:10] want to be a message person
[1:08:14] i want to be a believer of this message
[1:08:16] i want to have faith in this message and
[1:08:18] when it says things that i don't
[1:08:20] understand look at this this is an
[1:08:22] uncertain sound
[1:08:24] brother braham said this in 1961 and he
[1:08:26] said it about four or five times from
[1:08:29] 1957 on up to 61.
[1:08:32] he says now we're living in a day of
[1:08:34] uncertainty
[1:08:36] we live in the day where there's
[1:08:39] everything almost that we can put our
[1:08:41] hands on on the natural
[1:08:44] is uncertain
[1:08:46] you think he was reading our morning
[1:08:47] newspaper
[1:08:49] i mean
[1:08:50] everything's uncertain you go to the
[1:08:51] grocery store you say wait a minute
[1:08:53] those shelves used to be full
[1:08:55] and now they don't even know why they're
[1:08:56] not full yet theresa rides down the road
[1:08:58] she says she says sam we've got all
[1:09:00] these tractor-trailers going up and down
[1:09:02] the road how come i don't have groceries
[1:09:03] on my shelf
[1:09:05] i said i don't know
[1:09:07] that's a good question
[1:09:09] right
[1:09:10] but it's uncertainty everything is
[1:09:12] uncertain but listen
[1:09:14] the uncertainty is not for the children
[1:09:17] of god
[1:09:18] because our eyes are not
[1:09:20] our faith is not controlled by what we
[1:09:23] see
[1:09:24] our faith is not controlled by our
[1:09:26] emotions
[1:09:31] i told teresa i hope when that day comes
[1:09:34] when we go to reach something in our
[1:09:36] cupboard and there's nothing in our
[1:09:38] cupboard
[1:09:39] i hope that we'll have the faith to sit
[1:09:42] down
[1:09:43] at our table
[1:09:45] and thank god
[1:09:49] pray over an empty plate
[1:09:52] and thank god for the food that he
[1:09:56] [Applause]
[1:10:00] provided no doubt
[1:10:04] hold faster confidence
[1:10:07] steadfast to the end
[1:10:10] we cannot waver
[1:10:13] we cannot but if our faith
[1:10:16] if we have time to get over in the
[1:10:17] numbers 13 we'll find a group of men
[1:10:20] that was that was being
[1:10:22] uh uh
[1:10:23] led around by what they could see
[1:10:25] with their eyes
[1:10:27] and then when that when they came back
[1:10:28] to give a report they gave an evil
[1:10:30] report
[1:10:32] but there was other men of another
[1:10:33] spirit but let me finish reading this
[1:10:35] here
[1:10:36] i hope we can get on into that we'll see
[1:10:38] how the lord leads
[1:10:40] okay so we live in a day where
[1:10:42] everything's uncertain almost
[1:10:44] almost that we can put our hands on is
[1:10:48] uncertain there's so much uncertainty
[1:10:51] till the nations are quaking there's
[1:10:53] uncertainty in our national security for
[1:10:56] sure
[1:10:57] for sure how many feels comfortable with
[1:10:59] our president and our vice president
[1:11:02] i don't sleep good at night because of
[1:11:03] my president or my vice president i
[1:11:06] sleep well at night because my god is
[1:11:08] jehovah
[1:11:11] [Applause]
[1:11:15] national answer there is no nation safe
[1:11:18] anymore
[1:11:20] we could either be the victims of russia
[1:11:22] now this is in 1961 he's saying this we
[1:11:26] could be the victims of russia by
[1:11:28] midnight tonight or either be in bits it
[1:11:30] depends
[1:11:32] on what russia wants to do about it
[1:11:34] we're talking about our scientists he
[1:11:37] said they have men that they can put 200
[1:11:40] miles in the air in a little machine to
[1:11:42] come right over
[1:11:44] set them right down on top of this
[1:11:46] nation and send the message out and say
[1:11:49] either surrender
[1:11:51] or we'll pull the lever and that's all
[1:11:53] of it
[1:11:54] they don't have to wait till tomorrow to
[1:11:56] do it they can do it right now this is
[1:11:58] in 1961 he said that
[1:12:01] i'm going to read you an article in a
[1:12:02] minute
[1:12:03] i'm going to read you an article about
[1:12:05] what putin said the first of last year
[1:12:07] now watch this
[1:12:08] he said if we were sensible what would
[1:12:10] we do what would the pentecost what
[1:12:12] would the nation do it would surrender
[1:12:15] they would have to uh
[1:12:17] they would have then then what would
[1:12:19] happen wave after wave of russian
[1:12:21] soldiers would climb into our country
[1:12:24] taking your homes kicking you out into
[1:12:26] the street shoot you kill your children
[1:12:28] before you and take over the nation
[1:12:31] that's in 1961.
[1:12:33] anybody but think this brother wasn't a
[1:12:35] prophet listen to what uh putin said in
[1:12:38] in november
[1:12:39] mr putin himself suggested this is
[1:12:42] november of
[1:12:43] 2021. he said mr putin himself suggested
[1:12:47] russia could deploy
[1:12:49] submarine
[1:12:50] based hypersonic missiles within close
[1:12:53] striking distance of washington
[1:12:58] he has said repeatedly that the prospect
[1:13:00] of a western military expansion in the
[1:13:03] ukraine poses an unacceptable risk
[1:13:06] because it could be used to launch a
[1:13:09] nuclear strike against moscow within a
[1:13:13] few minutes warning
[1:13:15] russia he made clear could do the same
[1:13:19] from the from the beginning of the year
[1:13:22] we will have in our arsenal a new
[1:13:25] sea-based missile hypersonic one mr
[1:13:29] putin said referring to a weapon that
[1:13:32] travels at more than five times the
[1:13:35] speed of sound
[1:13:36] and could likely evade existing missile
[1:13:39] defenses
[1:13:41] it's an apparent reference to the
[1:13:43] american capital he added the flight
[1:13:45] time to reach those who give orders will
[1:13:48] be
[1:13:49] five minutes
[1:13:50] can you imagine washington make a
[1:13:52] decision in five minutes
[1:13:55] not likely not not likely
[1:13:59] he also said this in reference to that
[1:14:01] remark
[1:14:02] and in 1957 he said let me tell you
[1:14:06] he said the church won't see that
[1:14:08] she's going to be gone
[1:14:10] she's going to be gone when that time
[1:14:12] comes
[1:14:16] i hope nobody was getting nervous when i
[1:14:18] read all that
[1:14:21] hold fasts
[1:14:24] your confidence
[1:14:26] even when it looks like god is opposed
[1:14:29] against us and it looks like everything
[1:14:32] is going crazy we maintain our faith in
[1:14:36] god because we believe what god said
[1:14:41] and that's all that we need to know
[1:14:43] about it
[1:14:44] now what did god say
[1:14:48] god said
[1:14:50] he make everything work together for our
[1:14:52] good
[1:15:01] are you called according to his purpose
[1:15:04] he said
[1:15:06] that
[1:15:08] that he wouldn't allow anything to come
[1:15:10] upon you
[1:15:12] but what you are able to bear
[1:15:17] amen
[1:15:18] why do you think job wasn't shaken
[1:15:21] why do you think when joe woke up and
[1:15:23] all of his children was gone and his
[1:15:25] cattle was gone and
[1:15:27] didn't shake job a bit
[1:15:29] he probably wondered what was going on
[1:15:32] he probably stood back and looked at it
[1:15:35] you know job was slow to speak he was
[1:15:38] slow to anger
[1:15:39] he just watched things as they was
[1:15:41] unvalued saying well lord what's going
[1:15:43] on probably he probably was doing some
[1:15:45] praying
[1:15:46] but you know what the bible said job did
[1:15:48] it said that he got down on his hands
[1:15:50] and knees and he worshipped
[1:15:53] god he said naked i came into the world
[1:15:57] and naked i'll go out of the world
[1:16:00] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:16:04] and what we are able to see because
[1:16:07] we've got the bible to open up that
[1:16:09] other dimension is what was going on in
[1:16:12] heaven which was producing what was
[1:16:14] going on in earth and there in the
[1:16:16] heavens satan was saying if you let me
[1:16:19] have job i can get him to curse you and
[1:16:22] god said no i don't think you can do it
[1:16:24] he said so you can go ahead and touch
[1:16:26] job touch all that he has but don't you
[1:16:29] take his
[1:16:30] life amen
[1:16:36] jehovah was in control
[1:16:39] the whole time
[1:16:43] and you know that the trials from job
[1:16:46] chapter 1 got him ready for the trials
[1:16:49] in job chapter 2
[1:16:51] because there came a second plate and
[1:16:54] satan came up before god and god said
[1:16:58] wow my goodness gracious
[1:17:00] what do you think about my servant job
[1:17:02] he's a perfect and upright man he issues
[1:17:05] evil and and satan said the whole skin
[1:17:07] for skin he said you let me touch
[1:17:09] everything but you won't let me touch
[1:17:11] him you let me touch him
[1:17:13] and i'll get him to curse you to your
[1:17:15] face you see
[1:17:17] and god once again said okay you can do
[1:17:20] all that you want but don't you kill him
[1:17:23] don't you kill him and that's exactly
[1:17:25] what job what satan did he went in and
[1:17:28] he attacked but you see it was it was
[1:17:30] god
[1:17:31] preparing his servants and brother
[1:17:34] branham gave us the illustration of the
[1:17:36] big old oak tree and when the winds come
[1:17:39] and they blow against that tree and it
[1:17:41] looks like the tree is getting ready to
[1:17:43] be blown over and we don't understand
[1:17:45] what's going on but what's going on is
[1:17:47] that the roots down underneath the
[1:17:49] ground are loosening up and then the
[1:17:52] rains come and get down in there and it
[1:17:54] feeds that tree and it grows a little
[1:17:56] taller and the roots grow deeper and
[1:17:58] that's what's going on in your life when
[1:18:00] say when god allows satan
[1:18:03] god doesn't tempt anybody but god allows
[1:18:06] satan to tempt us
[1:18:08] you see and try to push us and test our
[1:18:11] faith but all he's doing is he's causing
[1:18:14] our faith to go deeper
[1:18:17] get more rooted and grounded
[1:18:23] what's your faith rooted and grounded in
[1:18:28] who said it
[1:18:30] love
[1:18:32] being paul said being rooted
[1:18:35] and grounded
[1:18:36] in love
[1:18:38] love my friends is what's binding the
[1:18:42] church together
[1:18:44] we we we have so much love for each
[1:18:47] other that when one has a heartache we
[1:18:50] all shed a tear
[1:18:54] amen
[1:18:55] amen and so with job just being an
[1:18:59] example to us of what it is
[1:19:02] for satan to keep a pushing and
[1:19:06] trying
[1:19:07] and and
[1:19:09] and and and it's not going to hurt us
[1:19:11] it's not
[1:19:12] god is is is is working things out
[1:19:15] together for our good
[1:19:17] but see what happened here is that the
[1:19:20] the children of israel
[1:19:22] when they were tempted and tried they
[1:19:24] didn't have faith in what god said
[1:19:28] let's turn over to the book of numbers
[1:19:30] let's just go over to the book of
[1:19:32] numbers we'll do a little bible study
[1:19:33] here for a few minutes
[1:19:35] amen
[1:19:37] oh my
[1:19:39] numbers chapter 13
[1:19:46] the tender hand of jehovah
[1:19:48] just think about the eagle when she
[1:19:50] stirs her nest
[1:19:52] the eagle when she stirs her nose when
[1:19:54] those babies are born what does mama
[1:19:55] eagle do she goes out and she gets all
[1:19:58] these uh rabbit skins and furs and she
[1:20:01] lines that that nest all nice and
[1:20:03] comfortable and the babies are born the
[1:20:06] little eggs to hatch out and and and and
[1:20:09] mama feeds those little birds just as as
[1:20:12] keeps them just as comfortable she can
[1:20:14] be but then there comes a time
[1:20:16] when mamba eagle knows that it's time
[1:20:19] for those little chicks to leave the
[1:20:20] nest and what does she do she pulls all
[1:20:23] that rabbit fur out
[1:20:27] they was sleeping on a real nice
[1:20:29] comfortable uh what they call a sort of
[1:20:32] perfect uh uh sleeper
[1:20:34] and all of a sudden now they got nothing
[1:20:36] but thorns
[1:20:38] and you go through life and everything
[1:20:39] going so smoothly oh it's so nice to be
[1:20:42] a christian
[1:20:43] and then all of a sudden you run into a
[1:20:45] few trials a few tribulations
[1:20:48] [Music]
[1:20:49] and if you're living by what you can
[1:20:51] feel
[1:20:52] you'll be shaken
[1:20:54] but if you're anchored in faith
[1:20:57] it won't shake you a bit
[1:20:59] you'll know
[1:21:01] do you know that peter
[1:21:03] peter came to such a place in his walk
[1:21:06] with god
[1:21:08] that when he thought about his trials
[1:21:11] he said that the trying of his faith
[1:21:14] was more precious
[1:21:16] than gold
[1:21:18] tried in a fire
[1:21:21] have you come to that point
[1:21:23] have you come to a point in your walk
[1:21:24] with god that when things start going
[1:21:26] upside down you say oh my what is god
[1:21:29] doing for me today
[1:21:31] what is god trying to work out in my
[1:21:33] life today
[1:21:35] i like the uh the the analogy that
[1:21:37] brother stephen brought us of of uh
[1:21:39] michelangelo when he went out and he got
[1:21:41] the was it michelangelo or
[1:21:43] got the sculpture
[1:21:45] got that block
[1:21:46] went down to the quarry
[1:21:48] and then he brought that that block up
[1:21:51] and set it up there and he just kept
[1:21:53] chipping away and chipping away and
[1:21:54] chipping away you see and some days is
[1:21:56] rougher than others
[1:21:58] some days the holy ghost sees a big
[1:22:00] chunk on there's got to come out and he
[1:22:01] just
[1:22:03] and you're going what in the world is
[1:22:05] going on but the only thing he's doing
[1:22:08] is going down to the corridors of your
[1:22:10] conduct
[1:22:12] and he's walking down into the chambers
[1:22:14] of your of your character
[1:22:16] and he's rooting out and he's getting
[1:22:18] everything out inside of there that is
[1:22:21] not christ
[1:22:27] the lord spake unto moses saying send
[1:22:30] thou men
[1:22:32] that they may search out the land of
[1:22:34] canaan
[1:22:35] which i give
[1:22:38] the children of israel
[1:22:40] of every tribe their father shall ye
[1:22:43] send them in
[1:22:45] every one a ruler among them
[1:22:48] and moses by the commandment of the lord
[1:22:51] sent them
[1:22:52] from the wilderness of piranha
[1:22:55] all those men
[1:22:57] were heads of the children of israel
[1:23:00] and then he goes and he lists all of the
[1:23:03] men that went there was uh 12 of them
[1:23:06] and if you'll notice in verse 8 he sends
[1:23:09] from the tribe of osh of of ephraim o
[1:23:13] shia the son of nun
[1:23:17] oshia is actually hosea
[1:23:21] i thought it was joshua
[1:23:24] let's read verse 16.
[1:23:27] and these are the names of the men which
[1:23:30] moses sent to spy out the land
[1:23:33] and moses called the name of ushia
[1:23:37] the son of nun
[1:23:38] joshua
[1:23:40] see he had a name change
[1:23:43] hosea means salvation
[1:23:46] but joshua means jehovah is salvation
[1:23:50] there comes a time where you stop
[1:23:52] trusting in your abilities and all of a
[1:23:54] sudden it's jehovah is what's important
[1:23:58] and it doesn't matter if jehovah is
[1:24:00] stirring your nest or if he's making you
[1:24:02] comfortable it doesn't matter your faith
[1:24:05] in jehovah is not dependent on on your
[1:24:08] physical condition it's dependent on one
[1:24:11] thing he said it i believe it and that
[1:24:14] settles it
[1:24:19] amen
[1:24:21] i like that
[1:24:22] [Music]
[1:24:23] in verse 17 it says moses sent them out
[1:24:26] to spy the land of canaan
[1:24:28] and said unto them
[1:24:30] get you up this way southward and go up
[1:24:33] into the mountains and see the land
[1:24:36] that it what it is and the people that
[1:24:38] dwell therein whether they be strong or
[1:24:41] weak few or many and what the land is
[1:24:45] that they dwell in whether it be good or
[1:24:47] bad and what the cities there be that
[1:24:49] they dwell in whether they be tents or
[1:24:51] strongholds and what the land is whether
[1:24:54] it be fed or lean whether it be wood
[1:24:56] therein or not but be of good courage
[1:25:02] and bring
[1:25:03] the fruit of the land
[1:25:06] now the time
[1:25:07] was the time of first ripe groups grapes
[1:25:11] so they went up
[1:25:13] and searched the land and went into the
[1:25:15] wilderness of zinn under rohab as men
[1:25:19] they come from amoth
[1:25:21] and they ascended up by the south and
[1:25:24] came to hebron where ahaman and shishei
[1:25:28] and tamai and the children of enac were
[1:25:32] now hebron was built seven years before
[1:25:34] zoan of in egypt
[1:25:37] and they came to the brook of ishkol
[1:25:40] and they cut down fence a branch it says
[1:25:44] a branch with one
[1:25:46] everybody say one
[1:25:48] cluster of grapes
[1:25:51] a branch
[1:25:53] one cluster
[1:25:56] and they bear it upon
[1:25:58] a they bear it between two upon a staff
[1:26:03] those were some kind of grapes
[1:26:05] i wouldn't want to buy those grapes by
[1:26:07] the pound
[1:26:08] mercy goodness
[1:26:11] can you imagine if you had to pay a
[1:26:13] dollar a pound for those grapes
[1:26:15] mercy and they buried between two upon a
[1:26:18] staff and they brought the pomegranates
[1:26:21] and the figs
[1:26:22] and the place where the uh
[1:26:24] and and the place was called the brook
[1:26:26] eshkol
[1:26:28] because of the cluster of grapes which
[1:26:30] the children of israel cut down from
[1:26:33] fence
[1:26:34] now friends the pastor was talking
[1:26:37] earlier
[1:26:38] in his exhortation that it's the fruit
[1:26:42] the fruit
[1:26:44] that that
[1:26:45] if
[1:26:46] if we could understand all the mysteries
[1:26:49] of god
[1:26:52] would that make us anything
[1:26:55] what if we had faith to move mountains
[1:26:58] would that make us anything
[1:27:00] oh we got bible readers
[1:27:03] what if i bestowed my body to be burned
[1:27:05] as a sacrifice
[1:27:07] would that make me anything
[1:27:12] if you read in first corinthians 13 you
[1:27:14] can do all those things
[1:27:16] but if we don't
[1:27:18] have
[1:27:19] love
[1:27:23] now i want to stretch our imaginations a
[1:27:25] little bit
[1:27:27] because brother branham said that we
[1:27:29] should live
[1:27:30] for the person who would kill us if they
[1:27:33] could
[1:27:35] so love is not just doing good for
[1:27:38] people
[1:27:40] that do good for us amen
[1:27:45] teresa and i was
[1:27:47] having a
[1:27:48] discussion this morning
[1:27:50] when brother stephen called
[1:27:52] and we just got through thinking and i
[1:27:54] said theresa
[1:27:56] i said
[1:27:57] think about the person that just
[1:27:58] agitates you the most
[1:28:00] think about the person that irritates
[1:28:02] you the most
[1:28:04] and so i happen to know one that kind of
[1:28:07] irritates both of us
[1:28:12] i mean i know juan that i know
[1:28:15] kind of irritates both of us she just
[1:28:17] they just have that way
[1:28:19] brother kelly
[1:28:21] you can kind of crawl up underneath your
[1:28:23] skin
[1:28:24] you know
[1:28:25] just when they come around you just you
[1:28:28] wanna you wanna hide
[1:28:30] i would really appreciate this board
[1:28:32] because i could hide
[1:28:38] and so i said well let me name one
[1:28:41] and she said okay
[1:28:43] and so i named i'm like a name and now
[1:28:45] this goes out on youtube and
[1:28:48] i found out that a lot of people listen
[1:28:49] to youtube
[1:28:51] i ain't falling into that trap
[1:28:54] oh no
[1:28:55] it's not you kathy i promise
[1:28:59] kathy's listening tonight
[1:29:01] i'll know now if she listened because
[1:29:02] she'll tell me about this
[1:29:06] and so i mentioned the name to teresa
[1:29:09] and i know sooner mentioned in her smile
[1:29:11] she just went ear to ear with a grill
[1:29:13] gun yes that's right
[1:29:16] and i said now from your soul
[1:29:19] from your soul
[1:29:21] do you love that person
[1:29:26] friends
[1:29:28] amen
[1:29:30] think about it for a minute
[1:29:33] the anointing of jesus christ
[1:29:37] if we had time to read all of chapter 13
[1:29:40] i could get into 14 you would find out
[1:29:42] that the that that that
[1:29:45] that the that
[1:29:46] these people came back with a good let
[1:29:48] me just let me just summarize it for you
[1:29:50] can read it yourself i don't want to
[1:29:51] take the time reading it
[1:29:53] but but but the the
[1:29:55] but but the children of israel went up
[1:29:57] into the the promised land they brought
[1:29:59] back the grapes they brought back the
[1:30:01] figs they brought back the pomegranates
[1:30:03] and they proved that it was a goodly
[1:30:05] land
[1:30:07] amen
[1:30:08] there was 12 of them went up
[1:30:11] 10 of them
[1:30:12] came back
[1:30:14] saying there's no way we can take the
[1:30:16] land
[1:30:18] the giants in the land the cities are
[1:30:20] walled they're too big for us the cities
[1:30:23] are fortified there's no way that we can
[1:30:26] take the land
[1:30:28] and it said that they went and they
[1:30:29] stirred the people up
[1:30:33] and caleb
[1:30:34] who who had uh was of another spirit the
[1:30:37] scripture says
[1:30:39] went over and he tried to calm him down
[1:30:41] and say oh but we're more than able to
[1:30:43] take the land jehovah's with us
[1:30:46] jehovah's already given us the land
[1:30:49] don't even consider the obstacles we can
[1:30:51] do it
[1:30:54] but that didn't settle the people
[1:30:57] and they got to the point they got so
[1:31:00] riled up
[1:31:04] let me read you
[1:31:07] this quote
[1:31:09] if i can
[1:31:10] find it
[1:31:12] quickly
[1:31:16] it's out of a message called stand still
[1:31:18] and see the salvation of god
[1:31:21] he says when god gets ready to do
[1:31:22] anything the people is all tore up
[1:31:26] the reason they're tore up in their
[1:31:28] journey is because there went out a
[1:31:30] mixed multitude
[1:31:33] now look we've been thinned out here
[1:31:35] after that last episode
[1:31:37] and and we're thinned out but everybody
[1:31:40] in here believes william branham was a
[1:31:42] prophet they got no problem you know
[1:31:44] everything brother branham said wasn't
[1:31:46] thus saith the lord
[1:31:47] and if if you feel that way it's okay
[1:31:50] with me i'm not going to argue with
[1:31:51] anybody but and everything that brother
[1:31:53] branham said was not does saith the lord
[1:31:56] if everything he said was thus saith the
[1:31:58] lord then when he said he made mistakes
[1:32:00] that was thus saith the lord
[1:32:07] i heard it come from a very renowned
[1:32:09] person in jeffersonville
[1:32:12] i'm not mentioning any names
[1:32:14] we're on youtube
[1:32:18] but people will know who said this that
[1:32:20] know him
[1:32:22] he said
[1:32:24] god doesn't make mistakes
[1:32:27] and neither does his prophets
[1:32:32] which prophet didn't make a mistake
[1:32:36] can anybody name one prophet that didn't
[1:32:38] make a mistake
[1:32:42] jesus
[1:32:44] jesus
[1:32:46] he was born a prophet
[1:32:51] they were humans
[1:32:54] they had their own opinions they had
[1:32:56] said things there's things that brother
[1:32:58] branham said that i cannot find that
[1:33:01] that would would ring true
[1:33:03] but i'm not throwing brother branham
[1:33:05] away
[1:33:07] there's such a richness there's such a
[1:33:09] such a uh uh uh uh a a treasure trove
[1:33:13] brother steven and i was talking about
[1:33:15] it earlier there's such a such a
[1:33:17] treasure trove of inspiration in their
[1:33:20] messages
[1:33:26] but this is its friends he said when god
[1:33:28] gets ready to do anything the people is
[1:33:31] all tore up the reason they were tore up
[1:33:33] in their journey is because there was a
[1:33:35] mixed multitude that went up
[1:33:37] and the testing time came
[1:33:39] oh i want you to notice this that every
[1:33:42] time that god makes a move there's
[1:33:44] usually a mixed multitude
[1:33:46] it attracts the attention of all and
[1:33:49] creates a mixed multitude
[1:33:51] when god makes a move you'll find all
[1:33:54] kinds of isms and everything moving with
[1:33:57] it but the testing time came and god
[1:34:00] tests every son or daughter that comes
[1:34:03] to him no exceptions at all
[1:34:06] god gives them the testing time to prove
[1:34:08] them
[1:34:12] hebrews chapter 12
[1:34:14] every child that comes to god must first
[1:34:16] be tested and if you're without
[1:34:18] chastisement the bible says that you're
[1:34:20] illegitimate amen
[1:34:25] oh my god
[1:34:27] oh it's nothing but the truth anyways
[1:34:30] it's all right
[1:34:33] amen
[1:34:35] and so now the the here's the thing so
[1:34:37] so now
[1:34:39] getting back to my thought the the the
[1:34:43] the children of israel
[1:34:45] was bringing back an evil report
[1:34:47] they were stirring up the congregation
[1:34:50] and you know it came to the point to
[1:34:52] where they actually want to stone
[1:34:55] moses and aaron
[1:34:59] and god pulls moses off to the side
[1:35:02] and says to moses just separate yourself
[1:35:05] he said i'll make of you a great nation
[1:35:08] and i'll destroy this
[1:35:12] people now can you imagine
[1:35:16] what did moses do
[1:35:18] did he say okay fine i'll just step out
[1:35:20] of the way
[1:35:22] he put himself in the breach for them
[1:35:25] people and he said no he said you take
[1:35:28] me and save them alive
[1:35:32] now you think about the person that just
[1:35:34] gets your goat and agitates you more
[1:35:36] than anything else if it came to a point
[1:35:39] to where that you knew that their life
[1:35:41] was in
[1:35:42] in jeopardy and you could put yourself
[1:35:45] in their place and they could be saved
[1:35:49] do you see brother branham said that was
[1:35:51] christ
[1:35:53] in moses
[1:35:57] amen amen it was christ
[1:36:00] the same anointing
[1:36:02] in jesus as he hung on the cross
[1:36:05] and the very people that nailed him to
[1:36:08] the cross and he cried out and said
[1:36:10] father don't lay the sin to their charge
[1:36:13] amen
[1:36:15] and it doesn't stop there
[1:36:18] some years later there were stephen
[1:36:21] all he was doing was having a bible
[1:36:23] study
[1:36:24] trying to explain things to people and
[1:36:26] draw them out of their of their
[1:36:29] legalistic hebrew ideas
[1:36:33] and they got angry
[1:36:35] and they threw them out in the street
[1:36:37] and they start to cast stones at him
[1:36:42] was he bitter
[1:36:44] was he angry
[1:36:48] it was it was christ
[1:36:50] that was inside stephen
[1:36:55] who prayed for him
[1:36:57] and said lay not this sin to the church
[1:37:03] amen
[1:37:05] now this christ
[1:37:07] remember the text
[1:37:09] it's the tender hand of jehovah
[1:37:13] and perfect faith
[1:37:16] in perfect
[1:37:18] love perfect love is the bond of
[1:37:22] perfectness
[1:37:24] perfect love casts out all fear
[1:37:29] so if you're fearful and you're afraid
[1:37:32] then get back in communion with perfect
[1:37:35] love
[1:37:36] commune
[1:37:38] in the beginning it said god
[1:37:42] created
[1:37:44] right
[1:37:46] is that what your bible says in the
[1:37:48] beginning god created
[1:37:50] now we know according to john 4 24 that
[1:37:52] god is a what
[1:37:54] a spirit
[1:37:57] and according to john first john
[1:38:00] chapter 3
[1:38:03] god is love
[1:38:07] so would we be wrong to read the
[1:38:08] scripture to say this brother robert
[1:38:11] in the beginning
[1:38:13] perfect love
[1:38:15] created the heavens and the earth
[1:38:24] see we have to be identified
[1:38:27] with what god is
[1:38:30] and this god
[1:38:33] he's so gentle
[1:38:36] he doesn't barge into in on us and and
[1:38:39] and and and tell us what he's going to
[1:38:41] do in our lives
[1:38:43] a gentle knock
[1:38:46] just a gentle knock
[1:38:48] and we open up our hearts
[1:38:50] and we invite him to come in
[1:38:56] perfect love
[1:38:58] taking up residence
[1:39:00] in our mortal beings
[1:39:02] now we're going somewhere so stay with
[1:39:04] me
[1:39:07] perfect faith
[1:39:10] in perfect love
[1:39:15] brother branham said when he went beyond
[1:39:17] the curtain of time
[1:39:19] and he saw those people in that other
[1:39:21] dimension
[1:39:24] and they were all young
[1:39:27] in the prime of life
[1:39:29] and they were all running at him and
[1:39:30] they were saying my precious mother my
[1:39:32] precious brother my precious brother
[1:39:36] what did he say you had to have
[1:39:39] to get into that land
[1:39:42] perfect love
[1:39:45] so it's perfect love in the beginning
[1:39:48] it's perfect love in the end
[1:39:51] and it's perfect love right now
[1:39:58] and a person that is possessed of
[1:40:00] perfect love
[1:40:01] is not easily shaken
[1:40:04] they have an understanding
[1:40:07] that god knows what he's doing
[1:40:10] and when it doesn't appeal to our
[1:40:12] natural five senses see tastes feel
[1:40:15] smell or here it doesn't shake us a bit
[1:40:19] and paul told us that we should cast
[1:40:20] down reasonings and imaginations and
[1:40:23] anything that exalts itself above god
[1:40:28] and let me give you this too paul
[1:40:30] himself
[1:40:36] an apostle
[1:40:39] filled with the holy ghost
[1:40:42] and he made this statement
[1:40:44] he said i have to bring my body
[1:40:49] into subjection
[1:40:51] least when i preach to others
[1:40:55] i myself become a castaway
[1:41:03] oh the message of the black dog
[1:41:06] when we realize that your that our flesh
[1:41:11] has got nothing to do with god
[1:41:15] it's an enmity to god
[1:41:17] it's a carnal nature to god
[1:41:20] and the only thing that we can do with
[1:41:21] our flesh is to bring it in subjection
[1:41:24] and that's why paul said in in romans 6
[1:41:27] 16 he to whom you yield your members
[1:41:31] servants to obey his servants you are
[1:41:37] and so bringing ourselves into
[1:41:39] subjection
[1:41:41] is is
[1:41:42] to the spirit of god is what makes us
[1:41:44] the servants of god
[1:41:48] amen
[1:41:51] oh my
[1:41:56] friend
[1:41:58] we're on a journey
[1:42:00] from mortal
[1:42:02] to immortal
[1:42:05] is that right
[1:42:08] and there's only one thing
[1:42:11] that i know of in the scripture
[1:42:13] that will take our mortal bodies
[1:42:16] and make them immortal
[1:42:20] and that's perfect love
[1:42:22] perfect love now listen here
[1:42:25] the bible said in romans 8 11
[1:42:29] it said if the spirit of him
[1:42:33] who raised up christ from the dead
[1:42:36] can we all agree that it was the spirit
[1:42:38] of perfect love that raised up christ
[1:42:40] from the dead
[1:42:45] if the spirit of him that raised up
[1:42:47] christ from the dead
[1:42:49] dwell in you
[1:42:51] then he that raised up christ from the
[1:42:54] dead
[1:42:55] shall also quicken that is make alive
[1:43:03] your mortal bodies
[1:43:06] by the spirit of him
[1:43:08] that's dwelling in you
[1:43:12] and it's an everyday rugged
[1:43:15] walking
[1:43:17] talking
[1:43:18] fellowshipping
[1:43:20] with jesus christ
[1:43:23] is what brings us into a perfect
[1:43:25] communion with him
[1:43:27] and you will know that you're in that
[1:43:29] perfect communion with him
[1:43:31] when you have love for those that
[1:43:34] despise
[1:43:36] you would you like to read that in the
[1:43:39] scripture
[1:43:40] let's turn to luke
[1:43:43] chapter 6.
[1:43:49] it's all about
[1:43:50] jesus it's all about jesus
[1:43:54] it's all about letting jesus
[1:43:56] this is not religion
[1:44:06] let's read verse 35 635
[1:44:10] he said but if you love your enemies
[1:44:14] and do good
[1:44:16] and lend
[1:44:18] hoping for nothing again
[1:44:21] and your reward will be great
[1:44:27] and you shall be
[1:44:28] [Music]
[1:44:29] the children
[1:44:31] of the highest
[1:44:34] to me that's pretty simple
[1:44:37] that's pretty straightforward right
[1:44:38] there
[1:44:40] can we read it again
[1:44:42] let's read it again
[1:44:45] listen this is not natural to human to
[1:44:48] human nature
[1:44:50] we must be completely surrendered to
[1:44:52] jesus christ this is something that only
[1:44:55] jesus can do
[1:44:59] don't try to do this on your own
[1:45:02] it'll it'll come out it'll come out fake
[1:45:07] it'll come out phony
[1:45:11] this takes the holy ghost
[1:45:16] this takes a hunger
[1:45:19] this takes a thirst
[1:45:22] blessed are you that you hunger
[1:45:25] and thirst
[1:45:26] after righteousness
[1:45:28] for you shall be filled
[1:45:32] but love you your enemies
[1:45:35] and do good
[1:45:38] lend hoping for nothing again
[1:45:41] and your reward shall be great
[1:45:45] it doesn't say anything about you shall
[1:45:47] be called
[1:45:48] the children of the highest
[1:45:51] it says and you shall be
[1:45:54] the children of the
[1:45:56] highest for he
[1:45:59] and we're talking about the highest
[1:46:02] brother robert when i read this
[1:46:04] it just spun me around
[1:46:07] there's nothing worse than an unthankful
[1:46:09] person
[1:46:14] i think i will
[1:46:19] it's truth
[1:46:21] how many has ever done something for
[1:46:23] somebody and you thought oh they're
[1:46:24] gonna be so grateful
[1:46:30] yes sir
[1:46:32] and you don't even get a thank you
[1:46:36] did you ever do that
[1:46:39] you ever you ever do something for
[1:46:40] somebody i don't even say thank you
[1:46:43] they don't even appreciate it
[1:46:46] but look
[1:46:47] what melchizedek does
[1:46:52] we're talking about melchizedek here
[1:46:55] we're talking about the highest
[1:47:00] we're the children of the highest
[1:47:08] we're talking about the tender hand of
[1:47:10] jehovah
[1:47:12] we're talking about perfect faith and
[1:47:14] perfect love
[1:47:16] look at this
[1:47:21] for he
[1:47:23] is kind
[1:47:28] to the unthankful
[1:47:32] and to the evil
[1:47:35] it's kind
[1:47:42] i don't know if that pinches your toes
[1:47:43] but it pinches mine
[1:47:46] you know
[1:47:50] i i've got i got more moving up to do
[1:47:52] brother robert
[1:47:55] look i ain't pointing my fingers at
[1:47:56] nobody
[1:47:58] but i have one learned one thing
[1:48:01] i'm not making uh my comparison to
[1:48:04] brother shambo or brother robert or any
[1:48:07] other brother
[1:48:08] i've got my eyes stayed on jesus christ
[1:48:17] and brother kelly i found out that when
[1:48:19] i find a flaw
[1:48:21] there's nothing that i can do to correct
[1:48:23] it
[1:48:26] but i found a source
[1:48:29] that when i come to that source and i
[1:48:32] say father i need to move closer
[1:48:35] [Music]
[1:48:37] he says son i was just waiting for you
[1:48:39] to ask
[1:48:41] come up a little higher
[1:48:46] read the message how shall i overcome
[1:48:49] and see if the prophet
[1:48:53] i can call him what he wants to to me
[1:48:55] he's a prophet
[1:49:00] in simplicity a little kentucky
[1:49:01] hillbilly that could talk in a way that
[1:49:03] i could understand
[1:49:07] and he said do you want to know how you
[1:49:08] overcome
[1:49:11] he said a little child tries to put on
[1:49:14] his coat
[1:49:17] and you hand him his coat he says i can
[1:49:19] do it daddy
[1:49:21] and he goes and he puts his coat on and
[1:49:23] he comes back and you know what's all
[1:49:25] inside out
[1:49:27] said daddy i got my coat on
[1:49:30] and your papa god
[1:49:32] i hope you know him as papa god
[1:49:35] we're not talking about somebody that's
[1:49:36] trying to put his thumb on us
[1:49:39] we're talking about somebody that loves
[1:49:40] us that once they hear from us that
[1:49:42] cares about us
[1:49:44] and he wants us all
[1:49:46] to be fruit inspectors
[1:49:50] but he doesn't want me inspecting your
[1:49:51] fruit
[1:49:54] he don't even want me inspecting your
[1:49:55] fruit
[1:49:56] or yours
[1:49:58] or my wife's
[1:50:01] i told her i said i ain't inspecting
[1:50:02] your fruit
[1:50:06] we're fruit inspectors
[1:50:08] judge yourself
[1:50:11] and you won't be judged
[1:50:15] it's nothing but the truth
[1:50:19] a
[1:50:20] man amen
[1:50:22] isn't god good
[1:50:25] i forgot what i was saying
[1:50:28] but it's okay god's still good
[1:50:32] what's that
[1:50:35] thank you
[1:50:40] not only is a good preacher
[1:50:42] and a good dentist
[1:50:44] but he's a good friend
[1:50:49] see when you're with family
[1:50:51] you don't have to worry
[1:50:59] if i was a bunch a bunch of if i was
[1:51:01] amongst a bunch of religious people
[1:51:03] i'd be up here saying oh my god what am
[1:51:05] i going to do i lost my thought i lost
[1:51:06] my time
[1:51:09] but one with your family you say
[1:51:12] anybody help me out i lost my tongue
[1:51:16] and so so the little boy had the coat
[1:51:19] and he tried to put it on and he and and
[1:51:22] he gets it on all backwards and then
[1:51:24] he finally turns around
[1:51:27] and looks at his daddy and says daddy
[1:51:29] will you help me put my coat on
[1:51:33] that's how you overcome
[1:51:35] that's how you overcome
[1:51:38] just we're trying to put on perfect love
[1:51:41] but when you look into your soul
[1:51:44] and you see yourself coming up short
[1:51:46] there's no condemnation to them that are
[1:51:48] in christ jesus who don't walk after the
[1:51:51] flesh but they walk after the spirit
[1:51:53] but now we can turn to our father and we
[1:51:55] say father i'm having trouble with this
[1:51:58] or i'm having trouble with that and you
[1:52:00] know what's going to happen you're going
[1:52:02] to come into the service the next week
[1:52:03] because the pastor said make sure you're
[1:52:05] here for the next three to four weeks
[1:52:07] and god's going to give him a message
[1:52:09] that's going to address exactly what you
[1:52:10] have need and you're going to go away
[1:52:12] and you're going to say thank you lord
[1:52:14] jesus friends we're talking about a god
[1:52:17] that loves us we're talking about
[1:52:19] perfect faith and perfect love we're
[1:52:21] talking about the tender hand of jehovah
[1:52:23] and when everything looks like it's
[1:52:24] going upside down
[1:52:27] friend it's just god working something
[1:52:28] together for your good
[1:52:30] don't worry don't be afraid don't be
[1:52:33] frustrated god is still in control do
[1:52:36] you believe it
[1:52:38] amen let's just stand to our feet and go
[1:52:40] to him in a word of prayer
[1:52:45] lord jesus we're just your children
[1:52:49] and we're so grateful lord that you gave
[1:52:50] us
[1:52:52] the spirit
[1:52:56] of adoption
[1:52:58] whereby we cry abba father
[1:53:01] and lord we know lord jesus christ
[1:53:04] that we're waiting lord
[1:53:06] for the red for for that adoption to
[1:53:09] come to full fruition
[1:53:11] which we know lord god is the redemption
[1:53:13] of these bodies
[1:53:14] and lord then we'll have a spirit
[1:53:17] and a body
[1:53:18] that will be matching together and so
[1:53:21] will ever be with the lord there'll be
[1:53:24] no more frustration no more heartache no
[1:53:27] more sorrow no more tear and lord i pray
[1:53:30] father for every one lord jesus that
[1:53:33] will hear this message whether it be by
[1:53:35] the way of of being here in person or by
[1:53:38] the way of youtube or or
[1:53:41] or some other way if they hear it lord
[1:53:43] god i pray that you go out and bless
[1:53:46] them with understanding
[1:53:49] so that they can see how short this life
[1:53:52] is
[1:53:53] and lord if we save our lives we're
[1:53:55] going to lose it
[1:53:57] but if we give our lives for the cause
[1:54:00] of christ then we'll save it until life
[1:54:04] eternal and lord jesus christ there's
[1:54:06] nothing that we could gain in this world
[1:54:09] that would be worth it if we were to
[1:54:11] lose our soul father i pray lord god
[1:54:14] that you'll speak conviction into the
[1:54:16] heart of the hearer lord that they'll
[1:54:18] hunger and thirst and that they will see
[1:54:22] that the when the spirit of jesus christ
[1:54:25] is in them
[1:54:26] that they want to have a kindness to
[1:54:29] people that are unthankful lord god when
[1:54:31] i think of you lord god the night lord
[1:54:35] before your betrayal and judas iscariot
[1:54:38] himself is there in the upper room and
[1:54:41] you got down on your hands and knees and
[1:54:44] you washed the feet of the son of
[1:54:47] perdition the very one who the next day
[1:54:50] was gonna go out and betray you lord but
[1:54:53] you humbled yourself and you washed his
[1:54:56] feet father god oh lord jesus christ and
[1:55:00] then i think father about the spirit
[1:55:03] lord god that dwells in me and i just
[1:55:06] ask myself father would i be able to
[1:55:08] wash the feet of somebody that i knew
[1:55:11] was going to betray me to such a hateful
[1:55:14] death but lord god if indeed it is your
[1:55:17] spirit
[1:55:18] that dwells in me then lord not i as
[1:55:21] paul said i'm crucified with christ i'm
[1:55:24] crucified with christ yet i live
[1:55:28] enough in the life that i now live i
[1:55:31] live by the faith of the son of god lord
[1:55:35] help us as your children to have perfect
[1:55:38] faith in perfect love and understand
[1:55:42] that the tender hand of jehovah is
[1:55:44] leading us to the promised land and any
[1:55:47] heartaches that we come and and have to
[1:55:49] withstand along the way lord god it's
[1:55:52] just you working something together for
[1:55:53] our good help us lord god take these
[1:55:56] broken up words and lord
[1:55:59] what the word that's preached is
[1:56:00] supposed to do
[1:56:02] is to build the faith of the saints
[1:56:05] because faith comes by hearing and
[1:56:07] hearing by the word lord jesus i pray
[1:56:10] father
[1:56:11] i pray that you'll build up the most
[1:56:13] holy faith
[1:56:14] of those that have heard this word
[1:56:15] tonight
[1:56:16] lord we present it lord to you lord and
[1:56:19] that you'll take anything that was said
[1:56:21] that was that was misquoted and lord
[1:56:24] just straighten it up father like the
[1:56:26] little boy father didn't know how to
[1:56:28] pray so he was just saying his abcs lord
[1:56:31] we throw it up to you father and we
[1:56:33] believe lord god that you'll take the
[1:56:35] intention of our heart and you'll put it
[1:56:37] all together and lord god what will come
[1:56:39] out of this service is there'll be
[1:56:41] people who have deeper
[1:56:44] love uh richer a joy more peace lord
[1:56:48] peace that passes all understanding that
[1:56:51] they'll know the love of god
[1:56:53] the heights and the depths and the
[1:56:55] lengths and the breadth and to know the
[1:56:58] love of god that passes knowledge lord
[1:57:00] and that we all might be filled with all
[1:57:03] the fullness of god we commit this
[1:57:06] church and our way unto you in jesus
[1:57:08] name amen
[1:57:17] [Applause]
[1:57:23] to amen the message tonight
[1:57:26] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:57:29] the tender hand
[1:57:32] of jehovah do you really know what it
[1:57:34] means
[1:57:36] it's really the trials
[1:57:39] and the tribulation and the persecution
[1:57:42] but
[1:57:44] it depends on who you are
[1:57:46] that's all if you're a child of god
[1:57:49] all things
[1:57:51] work together for good
[1:57:53] all things brother brad i'm saying if
[1:57:54] not god will be an author
[1:57:58] of frustration
[1:58:00] and not an author of love
[1:58:02] amen
[1:58:03] so there is nothing that can come in
[1:58:05] your life
[1:58:06] that god have no measure
[1:58:10] amen
[1:58:12] god looked at your level and he said
[1:58:15] she is on level five
[1:58:17] then he look at the child if the trial
[1:58:20] is eight
[1:58:21] god decrees it
[1:58:23] so you go 4.9

[1:59:12] if you understand that these kids belong
[1:59:15] to me this is the best that god saw in
[1:59:18] heaven
[1:59:19] to give it to me so there is nothing
[1:59:22] that this child cannot can do that i
[1:59:24] cannot handle

[2:00:02] child amen amen if it's a prodigal son
[2:00:05] god will reach out all the way there
[2:00:08] god let him spend all the money and put
[2:00:11] him all the way to the pig pen

[2:00:41] the house

[2:00:48] saying to pharaoh
[2:00:50] not even a hoof
[2:00:52] amen the hoof moses didn't birth a hoof
[2:00:57] but what moses is telling pharaoh is if
[2:01:00] he gave me this hoof
[2:01:02] i'm not going to leave this in egypt
[2:01:05] so whatever god gave me i would go out
[2:01:09] with it

[2:01:30] are or you have been compromising
[2:01:32] somewhere

[2:01:36] the
[2:01:37] north star you line up with the word
[2:01:40] automatically certain things will be
[2:01:42] taking care of themselves amen the
[2:01:44] trials that god brings in your life is
[2:01:48] not to destroy you god is just trying to
[2:01:51] bring you closer
[2:01:53] if god preaches something hard that
[2:01:55] hurts you he just want to get that devil
[2:01:58] off of you amen
[2:02:00] amen amen because god doesn't want you
[2:02:02] to be in the world that's all he just
[2:02:04] loves you so much more than you can even
[2:02:07] think because the love of god we can
[2:02:10] never comprehend it
[2:02:11] amen amen you say the love of god the
[2:02:14] bible says that who gives you the love
[2:02:16] of god it's in roman father
[2:02:18] the love of god is shared in your heart
[2:02:21] by the holy ghost
[2:02:22] that's why you need to get the holy
[2:02:24] ghost and automatically the love of god
[2:02:26] comes to you you don't have to force
[2:02:28] anything you're forcing things because
[2:02:30] there is a step you are in you're not
[2:02:32] somewhere that's why you're forcing
[2:02:34] things the day you're going to drop in
[2:02:36] that
[2:02:37] level that we're talking about you will
[2:02:39] see that's it's a neutral level you
[2:02:41] don't do anything anymore
[2:02:44] god will take care of of everything
[2:02:47] amen somebody will say something and you
[2:02:50] feel the black dog begin to move and
[2:02:52] suddenly somebody shut the black dog
[2:02:54] down and you feel like you know what
[2:02:57] just let him go and you don't know where
[2:02:59] he came from
[2:03:00] and you turn around you say
[2:03:02] that was me yes it's you
[2:03:04] but it's not really you it's christ that
[2:03:06] i live in you it's the crust that he got
[2:03:09] amen amen so stay closer to the word god
[2:03:12] knows exactly what he's doing don't get
[2:03:14] discouraged no matter what is happening
[2:03:17] no wonder what comes out in your life
[2:03:20] god have everything under control all
[2:03:24] things in your life will work together
[2:03:27] for good
[2:03:28] amen amen any questions so far
[2:03:32] do you love the message of the hour
[2:03:34] amen amen i don't know why people keep
[2:03:37] bordering themselves about brother
[2:03:38] brother i'm brother brother no brother
[2:03:40] brother brother either you believe
[2:03:41] brother brother no more just leave him
[2:03:43] alone
[2:03:43] [Music]
[2:03:44] right
[2:03:45] amen amen it's the word of god the
[2:03:48] problem is the gentile never was trained
[2:03:52] for prophet that's where we got the
[2:03:54] problem
[2:03:55] the jews knew what a prophet is
[2:03:58] the samaritan knew what a prophet is
[2:04:02] that's why when the woman at the well
[2:04:04] met jesus christ even being a prostitute
[2:04:08] yet she can recognize a prophet because
[2:04:11] they were trained on the prophet
[2:04:14] but the gentile do not understand
[2:04:17] prophet if you bring him a prophet first
[2:04:19] of all it's it's like something spooky
[2:04:22] why is this man coming up with things
[2:04:24] like this
[2:04:26] what's wrong what's wrong look at this
[2:04:28] look at this because we were not trained
[2:04:30] to profit
[2:04:31] amen that's why the ministry of brother
[2:04:34] brandon is very hard for people to
[2:04:36] understand you remember the quote i gave
[2:04:38] you last time where brother branham said
[2:04:40] that's why you're having a hard time you
[2:04:42] don't know how to separate me from him
[2:04:45] i am just standing there he's the one
[2:04:48] doing these things amen amen
[2:04:50] it's a different ministry
[2:04:53] if you don't understand that you're
[2:04:54] going to go left and right left and
[2:04:56] right left and right and you hear people
[2:04:58] but when i'm saying this but what i'm
[2:04:59] saying you're just wasting your time the
[2:05:02] prophet look at the way the bible is
[2:05:04] written and you're going to understand
[2:05:05] the
[2:05:06] ministry of a prophet
[2:05:08] amen amen amen was moses saying that
[2:05:11] saith the lord all the time
[2:05:14] was he saying that saved the lord all
[2:05:15] the time
[2:05:17] can you remove the word of moses that
[2:05:19] was not that saved the lord from the
[2:05:21] bible
[2:05:21] [Music]
[2:05:25] say what
[2:05:27] you see now
[2:05:29] you see now
[2:05:30] brother branham say if the bible was a
[2:05:33] book of a man
[2:05:34] they would have hide the error
[2:05:37] of the jews
[2:05:39] but put it there
[2:05:41] so that god is showing you that abraham
[2:05:44] lied
[2:05:45] but that abraham lied
[2:05:48] you want to chew it
[2:05:50] do you want to chew it
[2:05:52] it's the word of god amen
[2:05:55] but it's showing you something that
[2:05:56] abraham did
[2:05:58] and how grace is coming over to rescue
[2:06:02] abraham but it's still the word of god
[2:06:04] amen
[2:06:06] amen
[2:06:07] that's why when james comes and he say
[2:06:10] those men were the men of like passion
[2:06:13] like us you begin to understand what
[2:06:16] like passion means
[2:06:17] means there was a time brother branham
[2:06:19] run and told his wife tell them i'm not
[2:06:22] there they put it in the in the in the
[2:06:24] tape
[2:06:25] so you remember it's there
[2:06:27] so when you're going through trial
[2:06:30] something would knock
[2:06:31] this will happen to brother branham i
[2:06:33] see now i'm not gonna lie
[2:06:35] then you go around
[2:06:37] they use somebody else to bring you a
[2:06:39] stepping stone so you jump out that's
[2:06:41] how the prophets are in the scripture
[2:06:44] that's why you see david doing something
[2:06:45] wrong you don't understand because
[2:06:47] somebody down the road will do something
[2:06:49] wrong and they will go back to david and
[2:06:51] look and say if he did this to david
[2:06:54] how can you get a prisoner in the jail
[2:06:56] to preach the gospel
[2:06:58] show him moses kill somebody and moses
[2:07:00] preached the gospel then the prisoner
[2:07:02] rose up he said i killed somebody the
[2:07:04] lord can forgive me he he can go outside
[2:07:07] and preach the gospel because god used
[2:07:09] moses who killed somebody
[2:07:12] you see now amen
[2:07:15] that's a prophetic world he goes like
[2:07:17] that
[2:07:18] god put everything there he knows what
[2:07:21] he's putting there if he hides then we
[2:07:23] found out did you find no brother
[2:07:25] brother was not hiding anything
[2:07:28] brother brother was not hiding
[2:07:30] everything he put everything up there he
[2:07:32] told you what he did he told you he told
[2:07:34] the lawyer he told you how he repented
[2:07:36] to the lawyer it's clear what else do
[2:07:37] you want to show me
[2:07:42] this
[2:07:43] ministry
[2:07:45] is the ministry of christ amen the more
[2:07:48] i get in the message the more i love my
[2:07:50] bible
[2:07:51] the more i lo i read my bible and the
[2:07:54] message put me more in the bible than
[2:07:56] anything else
[2:07:58] so i don't see how the message can take
[2:08:00] you off the bible
[2:08:02] so you got the wrong message
[2:08:05] oh let's go back to the bible where were
[2:08:07] you the message was putting us back to
[2:08:10] the bible where were you

[2:08:17] crazy things somebody came and said look

[2:08:24] evidence of the holy ghost look at the
[2:08:26] word of baptism look at this back back
[2:08:28] to the bible
[2:08:30] amen who can point you to the bible like
[2:08:32] that
[2:08:34] when they challenged brother branham did
[2:08:36] he bring any any brochure
[2:08:39] what did he put on the pulpit
[2:08:41] he just took the bible like this he put
[2:08:43] it up like this he said you come touch
[2:08:45] this bubble and challenge me
