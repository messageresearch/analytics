[1:17:09] humbly this morning Father we thank you
[1:17:12] for touching sister tea and Lord father
[1:17:16] healing her and bringing the family back
[1:17:19] in order by the power of the Holy Spirit
[1:17:22] father I'm not praying for her healing I
[1:17:25] am just thanking you for your
[1:17:27] deliverance to this family Lord father I
[1:17:30] commit myself unto the hand and this
[1:17:33] church Lord father thank you for your
[1:17:35] grace you love your mercy may you move
[1:17:38] us completely out of the way may you be
[1:17:40] the one speaking to this church and the
[1:17:42] one hearing yourself preaching in the
[1:17:45] heart of the believer in the name of
[1:17:48] Jesus Christ we rebuke every demonic
[1:17:51] Spirit Away may you bless those that are
[1:17:54] here and and may you bless those Lord
[1:17:56] father that are streaming even in the
[1:17:58] hospital May the power of the Holy
[1:18:01] Spirit flow through the media in the
[1:18:04] name of Jesus Christ
[1:18:07] amen amen am you are Gods yes sir and
[1:18:13] all of you are children of the most high
[1:18:17] God God's Children of the most high
[1:18:24] H Allelujah amen let's see these Gods
[1:18:28] amen verse seven but ye shall die like
[1:18:33] what so these gods are
[1:18:38] mortal we went through this before amen
[1:18:42] but can you kill
[1:18:46] God it means that there is a
[1:18:51] component a part of these gods that
[1:18:55] die because you cannot kill God but God
[1:18:59] say you will die like a man so this God
[1:19:03] have dual
[1:19:09] personalities do you follow me in other
[1:19:12] word these God are first
[1:19:15] God Amen and then they are human
[1:19:21] being amen and both of these make one
[1:19:27] person amen amen so this person is
[1:19:33] God and this person is a human being if
[1:19:37] death
[1:19:39] come death canot touch God because God
[1:19:43] and death don't get
[1:19:45] along that's why brother Bram say Jesus
[1:19:48] never preach a
[1:19:52] funeral every time Jesus come contact
[1:19:55] with a funeral he he resurrect the
[1:19:59] person there was a widow woman with a
[1:20:02] child when Jesus met the funeral he
[1:20:05] brought them to life when you take him
[1:20:07] to the tomb of Lazarus he resurrected
[1:20:09] Lazarus because death and God don't get
[1:20:12] along one is a positive
[1:20:16] energy the other one is a negative
[1:20:19] energy brother Bram say death is life
[1:20:23] perverted
[1:20:24] one is eternal life and one is
[1:20:30] death are we together are we together so
[1:20:34] God is saying that ye are Gods amen and
[1:20:39] all of you are children of the most high
[1:20:41] God and you will die like men so when
[1:20:45] death approaches amen death will attack
[1:20:49] the human
[1:20:51] part amen but death will never reach the
[1:20:55] part of
[1:20:57] God because God swallow
[1:21:02] death amen amen so God is sending a
[1:21:07] message to his children that's right
[1:21:09] come on he's telling his children you
[1:21:11] are two part
[1:21:15] amen are we together there is a part of
[1:21:18] you that is
[1:21:20] God in a blunt way there is a part of
[1:21:25] you that look like
[1:21:29] me are we together and there is a part
[1:21:32] of you that look like other human
[1:21:37] beings because there are human beings
[1:21:39] that are not
[1:21:42] God they are human being but they are
[1:21:46] not
[1:21:49] God that's why Jesus say my children
[1:21:53] hear my voice
[1:21:55] but you are of your children the
[1:21:58] devil the devil children are human being
[1:22:02] but they are not
[1:22:06] God are we together are we together so
[1:22:10] this message is to the children of God
[1:22:13] how many children of God do I have this
[1:22:15] morning so this message is for you this
[1:22:19] prophecy is for you God want you to
[1:22:22] understand that you are not just what
[1:22:24] you see here inside of you you are God
[1:22:32] Amen I'm still reading the scripture my
[1:22:35] friend are we together have I lost
[1:22:38] somebody if I lost you raise your
[1:22:42] hand all right God say in verse seven by
[1:22:46] you the scripture have layers that's
[1:22:49] right H we are just peeling layers okay
[1:22:52] I'm digging now okay so I'm going okay
[1:22:56] now but you shall die like what amen and
[1:23:00] fall like one of the water so these
[1:23:04] children follow me
[1:23:06] carefully have an enemy we talked about
[1:23:08] it last Sunday and the enemy is
[1:23:14] death amen and we showed you last Sunday
[1:23:18] that Christ came According to Hebrew 2
[1:23:21] and he went and handed death amen
[1:23:25] when you stop at death here you don't
[1:23:28] really get what God is
[1:23:32] doing oh you don't really understand
[1:23:35] what God is telling
[1:23:37] you God disclosed death amen amen amen
[1:23:44] and God came down and handed
[1:23:49] death yes he did yes he did amen God
[1:23:53] Resurrected but you still
[1:23:58] dying amen amen if God already handled
[1:24:03] death why do we
[1:24:06] suffer follow me carefully my friend
[1:24:09] there is something else that is hidden
[1:24:12] in this
[1:24:13] scripture amen that the devil doesn't
[1:24:17] want you to
[1:24:21] understand that's why he has been
[1:24:23] fighting come
[1:24:26] on that's why he tried to close the
[1:24:28] service down
[1:24:31] am that's why he's
[1:24:33] upset because death he admitted oh yes
[1:24:37] you already won but there is something
[1:24:40] that the devil play around with you all
[1:24:43] the time but do me a favor keep your
[1:24:46] seat belt because we got to get to that
[1:24:50] what is it the question first is what is
[1:24:57] death amen amen am Paul says this in
[1:25:03] Romans chapter 6 verse
[1:25:07] 23 Paul said that for the wages of what
[1:25:11] sin is what
[1:25:15] death so death is the result of
[1:25:22] sin there it is my friend I told you
[1:25:26] keep your seat
[1:25:28] belt don't try to sleep today tell tell
[1:25:31] that sleeping devil leave me
[1:25:36] alone do you know why do you know why
[1:25:40] because when you with everything you
[1:25:43] done in your
[1:25:47] life let me say it this way if you are
[1:25:51] born it's sister jerusa right here
[1:25:55] and we put her into a a room she doesn't
[1:26:00] talk to nobody that's right all we do we
[1:26:03] open a window and we drop food there and
[1:26:06] we put her her stuff her soap and
[1:26:09] whatever and she live there not in
[1:26:11] contact with anyone because if she get
[1:26:14] in contact with anyone she will
[1:26:16] sin she will get upset and she might
[1:26:20] lies and so we we put her into an
[1:26:23] environment where she doesn't meet
[1:26:24] anybody she doesn't talk to Mama she
[1:26:26] doesn't talk to Daddy she's just there
[1:26:28] we put her in a border so she grew up in
[1:26:31] her own world have she seen no if we
[1:26:35] pull jerusa 30 years from there we say
[1:26:38] sister jerusha now come out do you not
[1:26:41] sin sister jerusa say what is sin if you
[1:26:45] tell sister jerusha you are
[1:26:47] God sister jerusha will
[1:26:50] believe right there brother amen amen
[1:26:54] because she never
[1:26:55] SE amen that's right
[1:26:59] amen I don't know if you're getting me
[1:27:01] but if you tell sister jusha now that
[1:27:04] you are
[1:27:09] God you know what the devil is doing
[1:27:11] right now you know what the devil is
[1:27:13] doing now the devil is telling you
[1:27:16] something the devil is telling you can
[1:27:18] God do what you did
[1:27:21] yesterday that's why he's upset because
[1:27:24] today you going to see what is
[1:27:29] is do you follow me the devil will tell
[1:27:32] you
[1:27:34] something he would tell you do you know
[1:27:36] how you get upset with your working
[1:27:39] that's right can a god get upset and
[1:27:42] guess what yeah I'm not
[1:27:47] God we Okay we okay I have to go that
[1:27:51] way so you catch it so Paul is saying
[1:27:54] that the wage of sin is what death so
[1:27:58] death is a result of sin because God say
[1:28:01] in the Garden of Eden the day that you
[1:28:04] eat that that day you shall surely what
[1:28:08] in other words the day you going to
[1:28:10] disbelieve or go contrary to the
[1:28:12] Commandment of God that's when death
[1:28:15] will
[1:28:17] enter are we together so when God is
[1:28:21] saying that he are God yes amen and all
[1:28:24] of you are children of the most high God
[1:28:28] but you would die like human being God
[1:28:31] is saying that these gods are subject to
[1:28:39] [Applause]
[1:28:40] sin are we together so these Gods these
[1:28:44] human being Will finds trapped with
[1:28:50] sin are we together because death is the
[1:28:54] result of what s so before you can have
[1:28:57] death you must have sin and God is
[1:28:59] saying you shall die like man in other
[1:29:02] word you will be caught up in
[1:29:08] sin and because of that I have to remind
[1:29:11] you you are God you say I'm a sinner God
[1:29:15] say you are God I'm a sinner you are God
[1:29:18] I'm a sinner you are God
[1:29:21] [Applause]
[1:29:22] [Music]
[1:29:26] [Applause]
[1:29:27] are we together are we together God says
[1:29:32] here he say for the wages of sin is what
[1:29:35] but the gift of God is what eternal life
[1:29:38] through who Jesus Christ Our Lord
[1:29:41] Brother Bram says this in the message
[1:29:43] letting off the pressure he said what is
[1:29:46] what death death is what
[1:29:51] s so this God are
[1:29:56] sinners follow me
[1:30:01] carefully can you say amen amen these
[1:30:04] gods are
[1:30:06] sinners wow
[1:30:13] amen the way you are

[2:31:45] one just like the way you make me and
[2:31:48] you one you see those one make them the
[2:31:52] same
[2:31:54] [Applause]
[2:31:56] way in other word when I leave the world
[2:32:01] there are other Jesus
[2:32:05] [Applause]
[2:32:09] there in other word when the devil will
[2:32:12] come to them may he feel the same thing
[2:32:16] he felt with me
[2:32:19] [Applause]
[2:32:23] if my level is 100 let that when the
[2:32:28] devil touch Charles Hamilton he need to
[2:32:30] fill 100 he need to say is this Charles
[2:32:34] Hamilton Char who do you hold inside of
[2:32:37] you great is he that
[2:32:42] is then he that
[2:32:44] is make all of them one
[2:32:54] let me help you up Jesus prayer God
[2:32:58] answer him how many
[2:33:02] times let's let me look at your
[2:33:08] prayer first John chapter what 5 verse
[2:33:12] what 14 and this is the confidence that
[2:33:16] we have where in him that if we ask what
[2:33:20] anything how according to his will he
[2:33:23] does what Heth
[2:33:29] us so when you pray there is only one
[2:33:32] thing you got to make
[2:33:38] sure when you get your prayer you just
[2:33:42] take according to your word and you hook
[2:33:45] it like this and you send it to God
[2:33:52] when God receive your package when he
[2:33:54] open according to this way these
[2:33:58] children just give them what they
[2:34:03] [Applause]
[2:34:07] want that's why you need to know the
[2:34:09] word you need to know the scripture so
[2:34:13] when you are sending the message you
[2:34:15] cing it you cing it because he look at
[2:34:19] that sanctification he said what is it
[2:34:22] did he put a word there give him these
[2:34:27] children let's go he say and if we know
[2:34:30] that what he hears us whatsoever we do
[2:34:34] what ask we know that we have our
[2:34:37] petition that we what desire of
[2:34:40] him there is no missing
[2:34:43] there Jesus always you God told you how
[2:34:47] always work because Jesus say do nothing
[2:34:51] that's right am
[2:34:53] except that's why his prayer works all
[2:34:55] the
[2:34:56] [Applause]
[2:34:59] time and God give you the same secret
[2:35:03] but let's look at what he was praying
[2:35:04] for you he pray he said father do you
[2:35:09] know the Oneness that me and you have
[2:35:13] please I want these kids you know I'm
[2:35:15] leaving the world if I leave them like
[2:35:17] this the devil
[2:35:20] the devil will trouble them all the time
[2:35:23] the only way they can handle the devil
[2:35:26] they need to be like
[2:35:31] me is my Bible different let's read it
[2:35:34] then I'm going to let you go because I
[2:35:35] cannot finish the scripture I might have
[2:35:37] to stop in the middle of the scripture
[2:35:39] we are on 12 we need to go to 24 how can
[2:35:41] we finish
[2:35:43] 24 are we together are we together are
[2:35:47] we together
[2:35:49] are we together sorry listen he said now
[2:35:53] verse 11 I am no more in the world but
[2:35:57] these are in the world and I come to you
[2:36:00] Holy Father keep through your own name
[2:36:04] Those whom you have what given me you do
[2:36:07] you see Judah
[2:36:08] there that they may be one as we are
[2:36:16] one as we are how was Jesus with God one
[2:36:21] he says I want them also to be one the
[2:36:25] Catholic interpreted this
[2:36:28] wrong they say that all the church need
[2:36:30] to be one that's not what Jesus was
[2:36:33] saying slow down okay listen to brother
[2:36:37] brandham brother Bram say I wonder this
[2:36:41] great thing this ecumenical Cel that we
[2:36:44] got in the world today and the World
[2:36:46] Council of churches forming together
[2:36:48] make us all
[2:36:50] one I wonder if they
[2:36:52] realize that is exactly what the
[2:36:55] scriptures say they will do but they
[2:36:57] think it is the most what wonderful
[2:36:59] thing in the world in the world that all
[2:37:01] of us can join hand and be how one they
[2:37:04] say Jesus pray that we might be one that
[2:37:08] is true but not that kind of
[2:37:13] one my friend I'm heading to the airport
[2:37:16] so keep your seat belt I'm going to load
[2:37:17] it okay he said be one as I and the
[2:37:23] father are one yeah be that kind of
[2:37:27] one then how will that be the
[2:37:32] word where in us will be the what
[2:37:36] anointed word that is the Oneness of
[2:37:39] what God see the Oneness of God is the
[2:37:43] word how anointed in you see and then
[2:37:46] you become a a son a Messiah of the
[2:37:57] age you become a messiah you are the
[2:38:01] Messiah of laia you are the Jesus of
[2:38:05] laia because Jesus is not there he wants
[2:38:09] Jesus to also continue in the world you
[2:38:12] are taking his
[2:38:15] place you didn't get that my friend
[2:38:18] Father I'm leaving the world these are
