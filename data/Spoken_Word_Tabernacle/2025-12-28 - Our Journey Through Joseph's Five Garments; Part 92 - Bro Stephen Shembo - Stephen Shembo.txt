We're reading our Bible twice a day. Our cood book, the church ages, 70 weeks of Daniel seals adoption or someone is listening or reading the message of the hour. If you don't do this and you leave and you miss the rapture, uh when you go through the judgment, you will see me on the big screen remembering you church. And God say, "Do you remember these churches and seven and the seals and everything?" So, make sure no one miss the rapture in this church. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. This coming Wednesday, our New Year service, uh, December the 31st will be at 8:30 p.m. How many heard me? &gt;&gt; So, if you show up at 7:30, no problem.

So, we'll have our brothers speaking and everything. If you need the quote anyway, I will read the quote. So, I I I settle everything and make sure you get it. And Lord's willing, we'll try our best to get the Lord's supper on the same uh uh evening. It's not the Lord dinner or the Lord breakfast. It is the Lord's supper. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, it have to be done in the evening. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Question and answer for next year. It's on January the 17th. That's our first session for question and answer. And for the young man's meeting, we need to continue on question and answer to make sure we wrap up everything and everybody's on the same page in regard to courtship engagement and everything. So that will be January the 24th. on Tuesday. Remember the prayer uh online it's at 700 p.m. Normally if you can you should be in prayer if you can unless you're working. If you can and you're not working hop on the line because we got people all the way from India on the line and when we are 7 of 700 p.m. here they are 4:00 a.m. in the morning in India. They are waking up to be on prayer service before they go to work and take their children as at 4:00 a.m. in India. Some are overseas in Africa, in Nigeria, they are waking up. So if those people are waking up at 4:00 a.m. and here you came back from work and you say, "No, let me take a break." No, you need prayer. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So prayer service at 700 p.m. The link is still the same. Usually I send the link so somebody doesn't say that they lost it or something like that. Amen. &gt;&gt; You pray for me for the married couple meeting. I sent a message. I'm sorry. I gave the two day but the two date did not work the way uh the two date did not work the way we wanted. The hotel was already booked for those uh for those date. Let me see if this is going to work. Sister Adessa. Praise God. Okay. All righty. Okay. Uhuh. That was a long time. Okay. All right. I see why you were distracted. So now you can focus right here and then we going to get to that later. Amen. Because somebody was reading that instead of listening. So I need I'm a teacher. I'm a teacher. I know my student very well. Amen. Have I say something wrong? I know my I know my student very well. I was uh uh uh there was a connection problem with the weather. So I want to make sure we send uh full connection and uh all the bars are on. Wi-Fi is working correctly. Amen. Shake somebody's hand. Say God bless you. &gt;&gt; Amen. I know you love the word. So when you have something like that, automatically somebody's trying to figure out what is coming up. Don't worry, we're going to get into that. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. So, married couple meeting, the new dates that were given to me by the manager are March the 14th and June the 6. I sent you a message on the group chat. If you didn't respond, so that's not my responsibility. I send it to get a feedback and we got a lot of feedback. So Lord's willing I send the manager the uh an email to confirm it. I usually wanted I mean a confirmation in writing. So just keep March 14th and June the 6th and by God's grace I will confirm it again as soon as I got an okay it finished. So just know it's those dates. So disregard the first date that we gave you. Amen. I received a poll for the young sisters meeting. So I ask a question. Let me know what you want to talk about. So put all your team that you want to talk. Let's sit and then go over things. I don't want to let you too far off and then you begin to forget certain things. Let's regroup again and make sure we all on the same page. Amen. &gt;&gt; The building project. You can see what's going on. I don't have to talk too much because the building is more louder than me. The building is louder than me. I don't have to say anything. So don't ask me any question. Why is not the building moving? You know what to do. Just do what you got to do and the building will keep moving. We got big bills that we wiping by God's grace. But my wife gave a testimony on Wednesday. I would step outside. I said, "Brother Robert, did you check the mail?" Brother Robert, just turn around and go straight and check the mail. He brought up a letter. I said, "Let's open the testimony together." that we open up $5,000 church. Not from this church, from way up somewhere. But I have to protect the person. I know you going to be online or you already online. I'm going to protect you. But God richly bless you and may God return a thousandfold to what you have done. Amen. It is an invisible audience that send that way way way. If I say the city, you will go there and then some begin to ask who's need. So I'm not going to tell you the city. Just know it's in within the United States. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; $5,000. So he help us fight the bill quickly by God's grace. But remember, we are talking about faith. &gt;&gt; Huh? If you got $20, if Sister Rosemary gave you $20, you know that you already got the evidence. by the Charles, right? &gt;&gt; We clear so far. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, I'm so happy to see several of you were sick. Sister Lilies, Sister Bridgen, I don't see Brother Michael and then Sister Yok. If I forget you, Sister Charlene and everything. I understand it's the devil. Amen. When I wake up this morning, I tried to move something and he goes boom. I say, "Oh my god." I say, "I'm drinking water like Sister Rosemary say." Um I I know if I say something wrong uh because she want my kidneys to be uh fine flush completely. I say where is this thing coming up? I say you know what I'm going to start praying. I'm going to pray and I'm going to go to church &gt;&gt; and I'm here and I'm fine and completely here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So when you're sick and you can stay home, I understand that that's no problem. You can stay home. If you're sick, you can stream. Amen. But be careful. &gt;&gt; I wanted to avoid this. This is not a rebuke. &gt;&gt; Uh let me let me clarify this because I know this is not a rebuke. Whoever stay at home, that was legitimate. &gt;&gt; Even brother Micah who's at home. Brother Michael, this is legitimate. &gt;&gt; Ah, so let's remove the devil. Whoever sister bridging it to everybody. That was legitimate. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Because you got a conscience. You don't want to get give it to somebody else and things like that and we appreciate it. No problem. Amen. But let me balance things uh a little bit a different way. Amen. &gt;&gt; So don't go with a gun to a sister or whoever was not there. You are already immune. You are vaccinated. Are we &gt;&gt; you taking my time? We need to go to the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So all of you are vaccinated and you are immune. If somebody come to you, just give me a call. &gt;&gt; We clear so far? &gt;&gt; We clear so far. But I just felt from the Holy Ghost that I need to say this &gt;&gt; that sometime you need to be careful. &gt;&gt; When you sick, where do you go? &gt;&gt; To the hospital. &gt;&gt; Do you worry about the nurse getting your sickness? &gt;&gt; No problem with those that stays. &gt;&gt; Do you worry about the security guy getting sick? &gt;&gt; Do you worry about the doctor getting sick? &gt;&gt; No. You are you are you you have enough faith &gt;&gt; to believe that when I'm getting to the hospital, &gt;&gt; I will be free, but nobody will get sick. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; It is okay to go to the hospital &gt;&gt; when you don't feel all right. &gt;&gt; Some of you are afraid. William Marion Brham. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. The Bible, brother Brham says in the principles of divine healing. He said the first thing a person does when they get what to say maybe around home you have a few remedies and thing you try. &gt;&gt; Some have ginger. Are we together? Some have Advil code and sness. &gt;&gt; Some have ALL TYPE OF A A A a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a a small pharmacy &gt;&gt; that you have at home and you go quickly or benadril or whatever. It's all right. &gt;&gt; Oh, you don't want to say amen. &gt;&gt; BROTHER SAY THE FIRST THING WHEN YOU GET SICK, what do you do? Go to your home pharmacy. So everybody should have a pharmacy at home. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Where you keep your vicks and uh &gt;&gt; have I say something wrong? &gt;&gt; Uh you're not helping me. &gt;&gt; You need to go open up your cabinet and get a Tylenol &gt;&gt; and get a Advil &gt;&gt; because God heals by medicine. &gt;&gt; Now, can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. Thank you very much, &gt;&gt; BROTHER. BRANDHAM SAY THE NEXT THING. &gt;&gt; When we say the next thing, it means your ginger didn't work. &gt;&gt; It means your magic solution didn't work. &gt;&gt; Have I say something wrong? &gt;&gt; If not, we continue. We close. We go straight to the BROTHER. BROTHER SAID IN OTHER WORDS IF YOUR STAFF DOESN'T WORK &gt;&gt; if your taleno your robbitum &gt;&gt; your day quill &gt;&gt; your n your terra flu &gt;&gt; your tummy flu &gt;&gt; all your flu medication &gt;&gt; IF IT DOESN'T work &gt;&gt; what should we do William Brham brother Brham said the next thing is maybe you do call your doctor. &gt;&gt; SO THERE IS NOTHING WRONG ABOUT going to the hospital. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Uh he SAY YOU CALL YOUR DOCTOR. THAT IS A WHAT &gt;&gt; sensible thing to do. &gt;&gt; So it's normal, it's reasonable &gt;&gt; for you to call the doctor. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; So I'm giving you faith for your medication. All right, brother. &gt;&gt; Faith for the doctor. &gt;&gt; But I'm going to move to a faith to a different realm. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham say, "AND IF THE DOCTOR CAN DO YOU NO GOOD." &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Then you got a RIGHT TO GO TO WHO? &gt;&gt; GOD. &gt;&gt; THAT IS WHAT YOU SHOULD DO. CALL ON WHO? &gt;&gt; GOD. &gt;&gt; AND GOD IS THE AUTHOR OF WHAT? &gt;&gt; CIRCUMSTANCE. &gt;&gt; He can do what? Nothing else can do. WHEN MAN COMES TO THE END OF THE LAND, God can too. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you sick, get your medication at home. If you sick, go to the emergency room. IF YOU SEEK, GO TO GOD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; BROTHER BRHAM SAYS in the message, it is I be not afraid. AND NOW YOU CRY. THE SENSIBLE THING, the what? &gt;&gt; Reasonable thing. &gt;&gt; When you GET SICK IS GO TO WHO? &gt;&gt; THE DOCTOR. &gt;&gt; That is right. When your doctor fails, then you say, "I got to go somewhere &gt;&gt; else." &gt;&gt; SO THERE IS NOTHING WRONG GOING TO THE HOSPITAL. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; BUT THE RAPTURE IS APPROACHING. THE RAPTURE IS APPROACHING &gt;&gt; AND AS THE RAPTURE IS APPROACHING OUR FAITH NEED TO BE HIGHER. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THAT'S IT. &gt;&gt; THAT'S IT. &gt;&gt; THAT'S IT. COME ON, BROTHER. Come on, brother. &gt;&gt; When you go get uh your terra flu, do you spend money? Yes. &gt;&gt; When you go to the emergency room, you know why you crying in the emergency room. &gt;&gt; You're not crying for the medication. &gt;&gt; You crying for for what is going to follow &gt;&gt; two weeks &gt;&gt; after your visit. &gt;&gt; YOU CRYING FOR $2,000 THAT IS COMING in the mail. BUT THERE IS ONE THAT CAN HEAL YOU &gt;&gt; WITHOUT A PENNY &gt;&gt; BECAUSE BY HIS TRAP &gt;&gt; YOU WERE HERE. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; I am not rebuking anyone. &gt;&gt; I am I told you I have to preach 10. &gt;&gt; I won't stay WITH YOU IN SIX. I HAVE TO PUSH you all the way to 10 ALL THE WAY TO WHAT THIS MESSAGE IS SUPPOSED to produce. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; How many people want to go to the rapture? &gt;&gt; Now listen TO BROTHER BRHAM. BROTHER Brham is saying this. Brother Brham say I truly believe when &gt;&gt; before &gt;&gt; not after &gt;&gt; BEFORE THE CHURCH can have what? &gt;&gt; THE RAPTURE. GOT TO HAVE water &gt;&gt; rapturing faith. &gt;&gt; WE CAN'T EVEN HAVE FAITH FOR DIVINE HEALING &gt;&gt; LET ALONE WATER &gt;&gt; RAPTURING FAITH. &gt;&gt; SO DIVINE HEALING IS ELEMENTARY FAITH. &gt;&gt; Don't worry. Don't worry. Even if you don't want to climb, I will put uh something and then go and pump you up until you continue to go up. Are we together? ARE WE TOGETHER? BROTHER BRANDHAM SAY BEFORE YOU EVEN get to rapturing faith, &gt;&gt; divine healing must be normal. &gt;&gt; That's correct. &gt;&gt; That's correct, brother. &gt;&gt; I know. I know very well. And we will continue with faith because we stop in faith. I know exactly. Brother Brandham say got to have a faith that shall change what &gt;&gt; and quicken this body &gt;&gt; and what &gt;&gt; be taken away. &gt;&gt; How can you believe your body can be changed? Do you think it's an easy thing? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Brother Brham says, he says, I believe there is a church &gt;&gt; on its road tonight, &gt;&gt; A POWER of what? &gt;&gt; THE LIVING GOD &gt;&gt; THAT MAN WILL DO WHAT? &gt;&gt; Speak the word. &gt;&gt; Where? &gt;&gt; Here and there. &gt;&gt; AND IT SHALL FLASH LIKE WATER. &gt;&gt; LIGHTNING. &gt;&gt; NOT GOD SPEAKING THE WORD. YOU SPEAKING THE WORD. &gt;&gt; NOT GOD. YOU TALKING &gt;&gt; LIFE AND DEATH IS WHERE? &gt;&gt; IN THE POWER OF THE TONGUE. &gt;&gt; Who tongue? &gt;&gt; William Marion Brham. GLORY TO GOD. BROTHER BRHAM SAID, "BUT LOOK FRIEND, THE TIME IS COMING &gt;&gt; THAT WHEN THERE IS DOING WHAT? &gt;&gt; But rising up a church. IF WE CAN'T HAVE FAITH FOR WHAT &gt;&gt; DIVINE HEALING, &gt;&gt; HOW ARE WE GOING TO HAVE FAITH FOR THE RAPTURE? IF YOUR FAITH IS ALWAYS your remedy, &gt;&gt; if your faith is always urgent care, &gt;&gt; if your faith is always the hospital, &gt;&gt; WHICH DAY IT'S A SENSIBLE THING TO DO, &gt;&gt; BUT WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO CLIMB &gt;&gt; TO A FAITH THAT YOU WAKE UP IN THE MORNING &gt;&gt; AND YOU SAY HEADACHE, &gt;&gt; MOVE OUT.

So when MOSES IS COMING WITH THE INTERPRETATION OF THE THUNDER, SOMETHING HAPPENED TO HIS FACE. &gt;&gt; We clear now? &gt;&gt; We are we clear? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we clear? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Verse 29. And it came to pass when Moses did what? &gt;&gt; Came down from Mount Si &gt;&gt; that with the water. &gt;&gt; Two tables of testimony &gt;&gt; in water. &gt;&gt; Moses hand. WHEN HE CAME DOWN from the mount that Moses what &gt;&gt; was not that the skin of his face &gt;&gt; he didn't know that the skin of his face did what &gt;&gt; shown while he talked WITH HIM &gt;&gt; SO GOD ANOINTED OR TOUCH or the reflection of God was seen only in the head &gt;&gt; this is Moses &gt;&gt; nothing reflect ed the glory. Only the head, &gt;&gt; only the head. &gt;&gt; The head of a prophet. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Normally, normally normally this thing should be God himself. &gt;&gt; Normally, it was God himself &gt;&gt; to go straight to Israel and talk to Israel. AMEN. BUT BECAUSE ISRAEL could not withstand the electricity, &gt;&gt; THE VOLTAGE of God. &gt;&gt; SO GOD HAVE TO USE A VEIL, &gt;&gt; HE HAS TO BORROW, &gt;&gt; A BODY &gt;&gt; AND THROUGH THAT BODY, HE REFLECT HIMSELF IN AN INTENSITY THAT ISRAEL CAN STAND. &gt;&gt; BUT EVEN IN THAT INTENSITY, ISRAEL WAS STILL AFRAID. &gt;&gt; AMEN. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Verse 30. And when Aaron and all the what? &gt;&gt; Children of Israel. &gt;&gt; So who? &gt;&gt; Moses. &gt;&gt; Behold, the skin of his face did what? &gt;&gt; Shown. &gt;&gt; And they were how? &gt;&gt; Afraid to come nigh him. &gt;&gt; Job 2:33. AND UNTIL MOSES has done speaking with them, he did what? &gt;&gt; He put a veil on his face. &gt;&gt; Uh-huh. He put a veil on his face. And a a veil on his face. But when Moses went in before the Lord to speak with him, he did what? &gt;&gt; He took the veil off &gt;&gt; until he came out. Are we together? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; SO WHEN MOSES IS TALKING TO GOD, no veil &gt;&gt; and God is transferring energy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; From himself to Moses. &gt;&gt; WHEN MOSES BATTERY IS FULL, &gt;&gt; are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. Moses &gt;&gt; put the veil &gt;&gt; and he come down in a mountain. So when you see a man coming down with a head &gt;&gt; veil, just know they got some thunders are there. &gt;&gt; HE'S BRINGING THE INTERPRETATION OF THE THUNDERS. &gt;&gt; And when he speak, IT IS GOD &gt;&gt; THAT IS TALKING. &gt;&gt; IT IS NO MORE MOSES. AMEN. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; Verse uh 34. BUT WHEN MOSES went in before the Lord to speak with him, this is the third time we're reading this. So you should be now saying amen without any problem. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; HE SAID HE TOOK the veil off until he came out. And he came out and spoke to the children of who? &gt;&gt; Israel. &gt;&gt; That which he was what? &gt;&gt; Commanded. So when he's coming, he's coming with a command. &gt;&gt; That's correct, brother. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Verse five. And the children of Israel SAW THE FACE of Moses that what? &gt;&gt; The skin of Moses face shown. &gt;&gt; And Moses put what? &gt;&gt; The veil upon his face again. &gt;&gt; Uh-huh. Until he went to speak with what? &gt;&gt; SO WE FOUND A veil that is veiling ahead of somebody. &gt;&gt; What does he mean? Let's go to second Corinthian 3. &gt;&gt; And how does this go with the parable of the 10 pound? &gt;&gt; If you give me time, &gt;&gt; 2 Corinthians chapter 3. If you dare, you can say amen. &gt;&gt; Verse seven and 8. &gt;&gt; We almost finished. You did very good and I'm proud of you. Congratulations. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Verse seven. BUT IF THE MINISTRATION OF WHAT? In other words, the ministry of death &gt;&gt; written and engraved where &gt;&gt; was how? &gt;&gt; So that the children of Israel could not steadfastly behold the face of Moses for the what? &gt;&gt; The glory of his countenance. &gt;&gt; So the veil was blocking the glory. &gt;&gt; The glory of his countenance. Which glory was to be how? TURN AWAY. &gt;&gt; HOW shall not the ministration or the ministry of the spirit be rather than what? &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; In other word, the word was coming. Moses was a shadow. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Moses was a type. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; HE WAS ONLY POINTING TOWARDS SOMETHING. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND WHAT WAS COMING WAS MORE POWERFUL. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; MORE GLORIOUS THAN WHAT MOSES HAD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; We clear so far? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right, let's begin our sermon. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; WE FOUND OUT THAT IN JOHN CHAPTER 6, buckle up my friend. &gt;&gt; Verse 70, THE BIBLE SAY JESUS SAY JESUS ANSWERED THEM AND SAY, "HAVE I NOT WHAT? &gt;&gt; Chosen you 12." JESUS CHOSE 12 DISCIPLE &gt;&gt; and he SAY AND ONE OF THEM IS WHAT? &gt;&gt; THE DEVIL. &gt;&gt; SO CALL IS NOT THE END. &gt;&gt; No sir. &gt;&gt; MANY ARE CALLED &gt;&gt; BUT THE CHOSEN &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; HE CHOSE 12 &gt;&gt; BUT ONE OF THEM WAS A DEVIL. SO THE TRUE BREAD &gt;&gt; AMONG THE DISCIPLE WAS ONLY 11 PEOPLE. &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; BUT BE CAREFUL. THIS ONE HERE PREACHED THE GOSPEL. &gt;&gt; NO, that's that's easy for you. &gt;&gt; Jesus say, "Have I not chosen you?" What? &gt;&gt; One of you is what? &gt;&gt; A DEVIL. &gt;&gt; THAT DEVIL PREACHED THE GOSPEL. Can you SAY AMEN? &gt;&gt; THAT DEVIL PRAYED FOR THE SICK. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND THE SICK GOT HEALED. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; BUT IT WAS A DEVIL. &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; SO THE MINISTRY OF THE SON OF MAN. &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; USUALLY PULL TWO KINDS OF PREACHER. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; AMEN. HE USUALLY PULL TWO KIND OF MINISTRY. &gt;&gt; YOU WILL SEE PREACHER THAT ARE TRUE BRAD &gt;&gt; AND THEY WILL BE ADDED THAT ARE DEVILS. &gt;&gt; It's hard to say. &gt;&gt; BUT BE CAREFUL. THOSE DEVIL WILL PREACH THE MESSAGE FOR A WHILE. &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; THOSE DEVIL WILL DO MIRACLES. &gt;&gt; UH-HUH. &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; AMEN. UNTIL A CERTAIN LEVEL. &gt;&gt; UHHUH. &gt;&gt; SO BE CAREFUL WITH MIRACLE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND HEALING. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; LORD, LORD, HAVE WE NOT CAST THAT OUT DEVIL? &gt;&gt; THAT'S RIGHT. &gt;&gt; HAVE WE NOT PROPHESY? &gt;&gt; AND THE LORD SAY, I NEVER KNEW YOU. &gt;&gt; SO THE MINISTRY OF THE SON OF MAN &gt;&gt; OR IN PLAIN WORD, THE MESSAGE OF BROTHER HAVE TWO KIND OF PREACHERS. HE HAS PREDESTINATED PREACHERS &gt;&gt; AND DEVIL PREACHER. &gt;&gt; THAT'S WHY YOU WATCH WHICH CHURCH YOU GOING TO. &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; JUDAH MAY PREACH THE GOSPEL AND AFTER A WHILE HE WILL DEVIATE. AFTER A WHILE, HE WOULD DETACH &gt;&gt; from the group. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; BECAUSE OF THE PROBLEM that was already it's obvious. &gt;&gt; If you detach from the from the message, &gt;&gt; Amen. you collapse. &gt;&gt; So, a new invention is coming. It's already ON &gt;&gt; WHERE WE DETACH from the message but we stay in the message. &gt;&gt; YES SIR. &gt;&gt; THE P THE FIRST THE FIRST LINEAGE OF JUDAH &gt;&gt; WAS LEAVING THE MESSAGE AND WHEN THEY LEAVE THEY COLLAPSE. &gt;&gt; THEY LOSE EVERYTHING &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE MESSAGE IS WHAT BUILD THEM UP. SO ARE THEY THAT ARE STILL AMONG THE GROUP ALREADY CAUGHT THEIR VISION &gt;&gt; THAT IF YOU PUBLICLY DENOUNCE THE MESSAGE YOU WILL LOSE YOUR PAYCHECK. &gt;&gt; Can you SAY AMEN? &gt;&gt; SO BECAUSE OF THAT WE WILL STAY IN THE MESSAGE BUT DON'T GET THE PEOPLE TOO DEEP. GIVE THEM ENOUGH RELIGION, &gt;&gt; BUT DON'T TAKE THEM IN THE THIRD POOL. &gt;&gt; You don't get me, my friend. &gt;&gt; Preach, brother. &gt;&gt; I don't know. &gt;&gt; PREACH TO THEM LIKE BAPTIST. &gt;&gt; PREACH TO THEM LIKE PENTECOSTAL. &gt;&gt; PREACH TO THEM LIKE METHODIST. BUT DON'T GET INTO THE MYSTERIES &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THE MYSTERIES IS WHERE LIFE IS. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; KEEP THEM WARM UP. &gt;&gt; MICROWAVE THE CONGREGATION. MICROWAVE THE CONGREGATION. KEEP THE CONGREGATION WARM UP. &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? BUT DON'T TOUCH THE STAFF. &gt;&gt; Am I reading a different Bible? &gt;&gt; Who chose Judah? &gt;&gt; Who gave Judah the ministry? &gt;&gt; Jesus himself &gt;&gt; AND HE HIMSELF SAID, "BUT IT'S A DEVIL." &gt;&gt; SO IF SOMEBODY DON'T LIKE THE MESSAGE, DON'T WORRY. IT'S ONLY AN INDICATION THAT THE MESSAGE IS RIGHT. &gt;&gt; You don't understand me. &gt;&gt; IF EVERYBODY THAT THAT BELIEVE the message, no one have refused the message, something is wrong with the message &gt;&gt; BECAUSE JESUS CHRIST IS THE SAME. &gt;&gt; WHATEVER THEY DID TO HIM, THEY MUST DO IT NOW. WHEN THEY BEGIN TO LEAVE THE MESSAGE, WE SAY GOOD STUFF. &gt;&gt; NOW WE KNOW WHAT WE GOT. &gt;&gt; NOW WE GOT THE SON OF MAN. &gt;&gt; NOW WE KNOW FOR SURE WE ARE IN THE RIGHT PLACE &gt;&gt; BECAUSE WHATEVER JUDAH DID NEVER INFLUENCE OTHER DISCIPLE. &gt;&gt; I hope we together. &gt;&gt; I hope WE TOGETHER. IN JOHN CHAPTER 6 VERSE 66 666 IT WAS NOT ONLY THE MINISTER THE CONGREGATION &gt;&gt; THE DISCIPLE MANY OF THEM LEFT JESUS CHRIST. &gt;&gt; WHY? BECAUSE HE SAYING EXCEPT THE MAN EAT WATER &gt;&gt; AND DRINK WATER. &gt;&gt; THEY HAD A PROBLEM WITH THAT MYSTERY. &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? AND THEY BEGIN TO LEAVE ALL OF THEM. &gt;&gt; AND JESUS TURNED AROUND. &gt;&gt; AMEN. HE DIDN'T WORRY ABOUT LOSING PEOPLE IN THE CONGREGATION. &gt;&gt; HE LOOK AT THE 11. &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "WHAT ARE YOU DOING? &gt;&gt; YOU ARE SO GOOD." &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; BUT THE SPOKESMAN PETER CAME OUT. &gt;&gt; HE SAID, "WHY DO WE GO &gt;&gt; IN ETERNITY? ME AND YOU, WE'RE DANCING TOGETHER. WE COME WITH YOU. WE COME FROM YOU. WHERE DO WE GO? &gt;&gt; I don't know if we're together. &gt;&gt; I don't know if we're together. &gt;&gt; IN OTHER WORD, IN OTHER WORD, what Peter was telling Jesus Christ, he said, "DO YOU KNOW WHERE OUR ADDRESS IS? &gt;&gt; OUR ADDRESS IS in heaven." SO WHERE DO WE GO IN HELL? WE DON'T HAVE AN ADDRESS THERE. &gt;&gt; WHERE ELSE SHOULD WE GO? &gt;&gt; YOU THE ONLY ONE &gt;&gt; THAT HAVE ETERNAL LIFE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Can you swallow this? &gt;&gt; I'm just appetizing. Can you swallow this? &gt;&gt; PETER SAY THAT WITHOUT THE HOLY GHOST, DID I SAY SOMETHING WRONG? &gt;&gt; PETER GOT THE HOLY GHOST ON THE DAY OF PENTECOST. IN OTHER WORDS, EVEN IF YOU'RE NOT BORN AGAIN YET, &gt;&gt; NO ONE CAN MOVE YOU FROM THIS MESSAGE &gt;&gt; BECAUSE IT'S A MATTER OF THE SEED. I DON'T UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING. I DON'T KNOW EVERYTHING. BUT I JUST KNOW ONE THING. THERE IS SOMETHING IN ME &gt;&gt; THAT LOVE THIS MESSAGE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; I have chosen you to have One of you is a devil. &gt;&gt; So don't be surprised &gt;&gt; in the group that is called from God. &gt;&gt; Devils are there. &gt;&gt; I didn't call them devil. Jesus say devil. &gt;&gt; Son of hell. &gt;&gt; Son of predestination. &gt;&gt; Are we together? And if you notice he always attached to money. ALL HE WORRY ABOUT IS TI AND OFFERING. &gt;&gt; IT'S A PAYCHECK, &gt;&gt; BUT IT'S NOT ABOUT THE SOUL. &gt;&gt; HE'S WARMING THE MESSAGE &gt;&gt; BECAUSE OF A PAYCHECK. &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? IN JOHN 13, &gt;&gt; Jesus looked at Judah. He said, "Whatever you want to do, &gt;&gt; Jesus didn't say, "Brother, why are you leaving the message, &gt;&gt; BROTHER? YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND THIS TRUTH." HE SAY, "NO, &gt;&gt; I know what you want to do. &gt;&gt; Do it." &gt;&gt; And do it how? &gt;&gt; Quickly. &gt;&gt; In other words, make your show quickly. &gt;&gt; AMEN. PUT IT ON YOUTUBE QUICKLY. &gt;&gt; PUT IT ON YOUTUBE QUICKLY. WHEN YOU FINISH WITH ALL YOUR EVIDENCE AND STUPIDITY, THEN THE WORD UNFOLD. &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; NOW WHEN JUDAH IS OUT, &gt;&gt; go visit. &gt;&gt; Go search your Bible. Jesus never called the disciple children. Only when Judah was out, &gt;&gt; when Judah was out, HE SAID, "CHILDREN, &gt;&gt; BECAUSE HE KNEW NOW THESE ARE MINE." &gt;&gt; UH, ALL THAT THE FATHER GIVEN ME, I WILL LOSE NONE &gt;&gt; EXCEPT JUDAH. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; SO WHEN JUDAH LEFT THE MESSAGE, &gt;&gt; SIR. &gt;&gt; WHEN HE LEFT THE MESSAGE, NOW JESUS CAME BACK AGAIN. &gt;&gt; YES. HE SAYS THAT YE HAVE NOT WHAT &gt;&gt; CHOSEN ME &gt;&gt; BUT I HAVE WHAT &gt;&gt; CHOSEN YOU. &gt;&gt; WHY IS HE REPEATING CHOOSING AGAIN? &gt;&gt; HE ALREADY SAID CHOOSING IN JOHN 6. &gt;&gt; NOW HE COMES BACK AND SAY YOU KNOW WHAT YOU DIDN'T CHOOSE ME. &gt;&gt; I am the one that look at the at the at the at the whole sheet and I cut you off. &gt;&gt; And I say I pull this. &gt;&gt; This is the bride. &gt;&gt; AMEN. I AM THE ONE THAT CHOSE YOU AND DID WHAT? &gt;&gt; Ordained you &gt;&gt; that you should do what? &gt;&gt; Go &gt;&gt; bring forth fruit. &gt;&gt; Bring forth water. &gt;&gt; Fruit. &gt;&gt; If you are bringing fruit, where is the fruit? &gt;&gt; Inside of you. &gt;&gt; The fruit only come out. &gt;&gt; The fruit must be first in you &gt;&gt; for you to bring fruit. &gt;&gt; And the fruit is a seed. &gt;&gt; And a seed tells your nature. &gt;&gt; Are we together? So when you bringing THE FRUIT, IT SHOWS the nature of the tree that you are. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND BROTHER BRHAM SAID THE FRUIT WAS THE WORD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; SO YOU MUST BE THE WORD TO PRODUCE THE WORD. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE EVERY SEED MUST REPRODUCE AFTER ITS OWN KIND. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We clear so far now. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's go to Luke 19 &gt;&gt; where we were in our parable &gt;&gt; where we left off. &gt;&gt; You're doing very good today. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Let's go to Luke 19 verse uh 11. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Remember this parable is in the house of Zakius. &gt;&gt; It's a parable in the house of a rich man. Jesus went to the rich man house. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And from the rich man house, he came up with a parable of money &gt;&gt; from the rich man house. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; IS MY BIBLE DIFFERENT? &gt;&gt; Verse one said uh uh who uh Zakius verse two he says Zakius which was a chief among the publican he was what? &gt;&gt; He was in this house. Instead of Jesus using other different parable, he begin to use money. &gt;&gt; In a rich man house &gt;&gt; amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. Verse 11. And as they heard these things, he did what? &gt;&gt; Added and spoke. &gt;&gt; After he spoke about Zakius, I'm just touching so we come up. After they heard these things, he added and spoke what? &gt;&gt; A parable. &gt;&gt; Because he was near what? to Jerusalem &gt;&gt; AND BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT that the kingdom of God should immediately have &gt;&gt; appeared. &gt;&gt; Remember last Sunday we told you the expectation of the Jews. &gt;&gt; The Jews were waiting for the Messiah to come and deliver them from the Roman Empire. &gt;&gt; But at that time Rome was a nion. &gt;&gt; Yes, it was. &gt;&gt; Remember the image of Nebuchadnezzar. FIRST YOU GOT GOLD &gt;&gt; and then you got the brass and got you got the silver and then after the silver you got two feet &gt;&gt; the Roman west and east Roman sir. &gt;&gt; Are we together? And the two ROMAN WERE AT THAT TIME IRON. &gt;&gt; BUT THE BIBLE SAID THAT THE STONE CAME &gt;&gt; CAME &gt;&gt; FROM THE MOUNTAIN AND THAT STONE NEVER HIT THE HEAD. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; He never hit the chest. He never hit the hips. &gt;&gt; HE NEVER HIT EVEN THE LEG. &gt;&gt; HE WENT TO THE FEET. &gt;&gt; THE FEET IS WHEN ROME HAVE CHANGED. &gt;&gt; Please keep your seat belts. &gt;&gt; ROME HAVE CHANGED FROM A PAGAN ROME &gt;&gt; TO A PAPER ROME. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE AT THAT TIME ROME WAS DOMINATING EVERYBODY. &gt;&gt; BUT TODAY ROME IS NOT DOMINATING EVERYBODY. IT IS THE UNITED STATES THAT IS DOMINATING EVERYBODY. ARE WE TOGETHER? BUT THE STORM WILL COME WHEN ROME IS DOMINATING EVERYBODY. NOT IN THE NATIONAL LEVEL, BUT IN THE SPIRITUAL LEVEL. &gt;&gt; WHERE IRON AND CLAY ARE MIXED TOGETHER. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. PLEASE KEEP YOUR SEAT BELT. I'M CLIMBING, MY FRIEND. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; I hope we ARE TOGETHER. SO WHEN JESUS WAS BORN, EVERYBODY KNEW HE WAS A KING. &gt;&gt; HE WAS A BIRTH OF A KING. &gt;&gt; THE MAJOR SAY, "WHERE IS THE KING OF THE JEWS?" &gt;&gt; WE HAVE SEEN HIS STAR. &gt;&gt; THE STAR OF THE KING. AND WE HAVE COME TO DO WHAT? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; So when Jesus is going to Jerusalem, everybody say that's it. Now &gt;&gt; finally the Roman we are finished with you. So everybody's getting ready for Jesus to become the new king and take over Israel and restore Israel to the time of Solomon. &gt;&gt; Because a greater than Solomon was here. &gt;&gt; WHEN HE SAY GREATER THAN SOLOMON WAS HERE. IN OTHER WORDS, I AM THE GOD THAT I HAVE COME HERE. IS SAID PRAISE THE LORD. NOW WE WILL BE FREE. &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; Are we together? THIS BELIEF WAS SO STRONG &gt;&gt; EVEN AMONG THE DISCIPLE OF JESUS CHRIST. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; And this is THE REASON WHY THE BIBLE IS SAYING IN VERSE 11 THAT JESUS WANTED TO CORRECT THEM. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; YES SIR. &gt;&gt; JESUS WANTED TO REFOCUS THEM. JESUS WANTED TO GIVE THEM THE PROPER SEQUENCE &gt;&gt; OF THINGS BEFORE HE RULE &gt;&gt; AS A KING. &gt;&gt; HE WAS BORN A KING &gt;&gt; BUT HE WAS NOT COMING TO RULE AS A KING YET &gt;&gt; HE WAS NOT COMING TO TAKE OVER THE KINGDOM OF THE WORLD. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; AND THE DISCIPLE HAD A HARD TIME. AMEN. &gt;&gt; Jesus is explaining this BEFORE HIS DEATH. &gt;&gt; BUT AFTER JESUS IS DEAD, STILL THE DISCIPLES STRUGGLE. &gt;&gt; YES, THEY DID. &gt;&gt; THE BIBLE SAYS THIS, MY FRIEND, IN THE BOOK of Luke 24, let's stay focused, my friend. Verse 18, AND THE ONE OF THEM WHOSE name was who? &gt;&gt; Cleopus. &gt;&gt; Answering. I put this to help you so you don't have to flip pages. So, I was the one working on your on your place. So all you have to do is chill out and focus. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; HE SAYS ANSWERING SAY UNTO HIM, "ARE THOU THE ART ARE THOU ONLY A WHAT? &gt;&gt; A STRANGER IN JERUSALEM &gt;&gt; AND HAS NOT KNOWN THESE THINGS WHICH ARE COME TO PASS IN THE WATER &gt;&gt; in these days." &gt;&gt; AND HE SAYS UNTO THEM, "WHAT THINGS?" &gt;&gt; Like he didn't know what he was asking. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AND THEY SAY UNTO HIM CONCERNING WHO? &gt;&gt; JESUS OF NAZARETH, &gt;&gt; which was what? &gt;&gt; A prophet. &gt;&gt; How? MIGHTY INDEED &gt;&gt; AND WORD BEFORE GOD AND WHAT &gt;&gt; AND ALL THE PEOPLE &gt;&gt; HAD THE CHIEF PRIEST AND THE RULER did what? &gt;&gt; Delivered him to be condemned to DEATH &gt;&gt; AND HAVE DONE WHAT? &gt;&gt; HAVE CRUCIFIED HIM. &gt;&gt; BUT WE TRUSTED &gt;&gt; WE TRUSTED THAT HE HAD BEEN HE &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ WHICH SHOULD HAVE WHAT? &gt;&gt; Redeemed Israel. &gt;&gt; THE WORD REDEEM MEANS DELIVER ISRAEL. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? IN OTHER WORDS, THEY WERE GOING SAD &gt;&gt; BECAUSE JESUS TOLD THEM, "WHY ARE YOU SAD? &gt;&gt; WHAT KIND OF CONVERSATION do you have? &gt;&gt; You don't know what happened. &gt;&gt; What happened? &gt;&gt; This Jesus, in other words, our hope, we thought this is the man that will come and deliver Israel." &gt;&gt; But now it's three days and we hearing some women are telling us Jesus look at them, he say, "You fools. ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THEY STILL BELIEVE &gt;&gt; THAT THE MESSIAH WAS SUPPOSED TO DELIVER ISRAEL. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; I hope we ARE TOGETHER. WHEN JESUS DISPLAY HIMSELF AND ALL THE DISCIPLES SHOW HIM SAW HIM, he came up. He said, "All power in heaven and earth &gt;&gt; is given unto him." &gt;&gt; The disciples say that's it. Now all power in heaven and earth is given on him. So now &gt;&gt; ah we got it in THE BOOK OF ACTS CHAPTER ONE VERSE 6 THE BIBLE SAY WHEN THEY THEREFORE WILL COME HOW &gt;&gt; TOGETHER &gt;&gt; THEY ASK OF HIM AFTER THE RESURRECTION &gt;&gt; THEY SAY LORD will thou &gt;&gt; at this time &gt;&gt; do what? &gt;&gt; Restore again the kingdom TO ISRAEL. &gt;&gt; SO STILL THEY'RE SAYING WAIT A MINUTE. SO NOW THAT ALL POWER IN HEAVEN AND EARTH IS GIVEN UNTO YOU. SO NOW THIS IS THE TIME THAT YOU GOING TO RESTORE THE KINGDOM OF ISRAEL. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Job to verse 12, my friend. &gt;&gt; Verse 12. AND HE SAID, THEREFORE, he's correcting their expectation. &gt;&gt; A CERTAIN WHAT? &gt;&gt; Noble man. Remember noble man is a noble birth. &gt;&gt; A noble man. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; From a noble birth. And another translation in the Greek say he was royal. &gt;&gt; A man of royalty. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A noble man WENT INTO A WHAT? &gt;&gt; Far country. &gt;&gt; I gave you the quote again during the week. Far country means what? &gt;&gt; Heaven. &gt;&gt; Amen. So he's telling them, listen, the noble man must go to heaven. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; To a far country to receive what? &gt;&gt; For himself a kingdom &gt;&gt; and to DO WHAT? &gt;&gt; RETURN. &gt;&gt; SO HE WAS CROWNED HERE WITH STONE. &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THEY REJECTED HIS KINGDOM. &gt;&gt; I'M GOING TO GET to that. AMEN. &gt;&gt; BUT HE NEED TO BE CROWNED KING. &gt;&gt; WHEN ARE WE TOGETHER? SO HE'S TELLING THEM THAT THE EXPECTATION YOU WAITING IT'S NOT NOW. &gt;&gt; I MUST FIRST GO &gt;&gt; to heaven. &gt;&gt; And when I'M GOING TO HEAVEN, I'M GOING IN THE ROYAL LINEAGE &gt;&gt; OF DAVID. &gt;&gt; THEN WHEN I GET THERE, I WILL BE CROWNED. &gt;&gt; I WILL RECEIVE a kingdom. Are we together? &gt;&gt; And when I receive THE KINGDOM, I WILL COME BACK. SO WHEN HE'S COMING BACK, &gt;&gt; HE'S COMING BACK AS A KING. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; I hope WE ARE TOGETHER. &gt;&gt; HE'S COMING BACK IN REVELATION 19, &gt;&gt; KING OF KING, &gt;&gt; LORD OF LORD, WITH A CROWN AND EVERYTHING. AND HE'S COMING TO TAKE OVER. THE KINGDOM OF THIS WORLD WILL BECOME THE KINGDOM OF OUR LORD. &gt;&gt; ARE WE all together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Now listen to this. When they ask HIM A QUESTION, THEY SAY, "WILL YOU AT this time restore again the kingdom of water &gt;&gt; to Israel?" &gt;&gt; AND HE SAYS UNTO THEM, "IT IS NOT FOR YOU &gt;&gt; TO KNOW what &gt;&gt; the times &gt;&gt; and the what &gt;&gt; or the seasons." &gt;&gt; Do you see the word season? &gt;&gt; Which the father has put where? &gt;&gt; In his OWN POWER. &gt;&gt; BUT &gt;&gt; BUT &gt;&gt; follow me carefully. &gt;&gt; YE SHALL RECEIVE WHAT? &gt;&gt; POWER. IN OTHER WORDS, HE'S TELLING THEM, "HEY, YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THE RESTORATION. &gt;&gt; WHAT YOU NEED TO FOCUS ON NOW, &gt;&gt; LISTEN, my friend, &gt;&gt; let's focus here. Let's let's focus here. &gt;&gt; This is a surgery, my friend." &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THE DISCIPLE WERE COMING AGAIN. &gt;&gt; THEY SAID, "LISTEN, NOW ALL POWER ARE GIVEN TO YOU. SO YOU WILL RESTORE the kingdom. Now &gt;&gt; in other words, are we GOING TO TAKE THE WHITE HOUSE RIGHT NOW? &gt;&gt; He says, "No, leave the White HOUSE ALONE." &gt;&gt; THERE ARE TIME AND SEASON &gt;&gt; THAT ARE THERE. &gt;&gt; WHAT YOU NEED TO FOCUS right now IS I'M GOING TO DELIVER SOMETHING to you. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; THERE IS SOMETHING THAT I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU. &gt;&gt; I'M GOING &gt;&gt; I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU SOMETHING. &gt;&gt; I HOPE WE are together. IN OTHER WORDS, FOCUS ON WHAT I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU &gt;&gt; AND LEAVE THE TIME ALONE. &gt;&gt; I HOPE WE are together. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; BROTHER, THE BIBLE SAY, "BUT YE SHALL DO WHAT? &gt;&gt; Receive power." &gt;&gt; Receive power. Remember the word power? &gt;&gt; AFTER WHAT? &gt;&gt; That the Holy Ghost has come UPON YOU. &gt;&gt; SO THE HOLY GHOST IS GOING TO COME. &gt;&gt; And when THE HOLY GHOST COME, HE WILL GIVE YOU POWER. &gt;&gt; POWER.

He get into the jet. &gt;&gt; When he finished, he said, "Hey, I already told you I'm going to a far away country." He get INTO A JET. THE BIBLE SAY HE WAS TAKEN UP AND WHAT? &gt;&gt; CLOUDS &gt;&gt; DID WHAT? received him out of THEIR SIGHT. &gt;&gt; SO HE WENT INTO A FAR COUNTRY. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; BUT FOR ME TO RETURN, &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; YES. &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? THE GOSPEL MUST GO EVERYWHERE. &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; We clear so far? &gt;&gt; BUT WHEN JESUS CAME, what did he bring? &gt;&gt; YES, MA'AM. &gt;&gt; THE BIBLE SAYS THIS IN THE BOOK OF Galatians 3:23. BUT BEFORE WHAT? &gt;&gt; FAITH CAME. &gt;&gt; So faith was not there yet. &gt;&gt; All right. That's correct. Amen. &gt;&gt; Before faith came. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; THERE WAS A FAITH THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO COME. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Some of you don't have work tomorrow. Let's focus. &gt;&gt; THERE IS A FAITH THAT WAS SUPPOSED TO COME. &gt;&gt; BUT PAUL IS SAYING BEFORE THAT FAITH CAME. &gt;&gt; Follow me. &gt;&gt; AMEN. BEFORE FAITH CAME, This pound here in the parable was money. &gt;&gt; And we FOUND OUT LAST WEEK THAT MONEY was faith. &gt;&gt; Now, now we clear.

WE WERE LOCKED &gt;&gt; ONTO WAITING &gt;&gt; FOR THE FAITH &gt;&gt; WHICH SHOULD WHAT &gt;&gt; AFTERWARDS BE REVEALED. &gt;&gt; SO WHEN JESUS CHRIST CAME, JESUS BROUGHT THAT FAITH. &gt;&gt; THAT FAITH WAS CRUSHED. &gt;&gt; I hope we together. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; My friend, this is a surgery. &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? SO WHEN JESUS CHRIST CAME, HE DIDN'T JUST COME LIKE THAT. HE BROUGHT FAITH. &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; BUT BEFORE HE LEAVE, &gt;&gt; HE MUST LEAVE SOMETHING &gt;&gt; TO THE SERVANT. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; JOB TO VERSE 13. &gt;&gt; JOB TO VERSE 13. &gt;&gt; THE BIBLE SAY, "AND HE CALLED WHAT? &gt;&gt; HIS 10 SERVANTS." &gt;&gt; How many servant do we have? &gt;&gt; 10 servants. 10 servant &gt;&gt; and did what? &gt;&gt; And delivered them 10 pounds. &gt;&gt; He delivered them 10 pound. &gt;&gt; How many servant do we have? &gt;&gt; 10 servant. &gt;&gt; How many pound do we have? &gt;&gt; 10. &gt;&gt; 10 divided by 10 equal what? &gt;&gt; One. &gt;&gt; So one pound per servant. &gt;&gt; Follow me my friend. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; One pound per servant. &gt;&gt; ONE POUND PER SERVANT.

DON'T HAVE NOTHING TO DO WITH IT. &gt;&gt; YOU GOT WHAT? &gt;&gt; The purchase power. &gt;&gt; You do what? &gt;&gt; BELIEVE IT. &gt;&gt; YOU JUST START WHAT? &gt;&gt; DANCING A LITTLE JIG. &gt;&gt; Don't worry. Some of you are humble. &gt;&gt; Very humble. It's not your nature. &gt;&gt; Your nature is calmer. &gt;&gt; BUT BROTHER SAY YOU START WHAT? &gt;&gt; Dancing a little J. &gt;&gt; Go remove it from the message. &gt;&gt; That's your problem. &gt;&gt; It's not my nature. &gt;&gt; You are doing again Jesus &gt;&gt; in your special way. Who? Papa, you made possible. &gt;&gt; You will do it again. Jesus in your special way. What seem simple. &gt;&gt; THOSE ARE THE SONG OF PEOPLE THAT HAVE FAITH. ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; MY FRIEND, if you a devil around me, you trouble. &gt;&gt; I WILL MAKE YOU UNCOMFORTABLE. &gt;&gt; BROTHER, BROTHER SAY YOU START A LITTLE JIG SAYING WHAT? &gt;&gt; PRAISE GOD. &gt;&gt; I'M GOING TO BE WHERE? BECAUSE I GOT WHAT &gt;&gt; THE PURCHASING POWER. &gt;&gt; THERE YOU ARE. &gt;&gt; HE'S ABLE. HE'S ABLE. HE'S ABLE. &gt;&gt; HE'S ABLE. HE'S ABLE. &gt;&gt; HE'S ABLE. &gt;&gt; WHATEVER YOU WANT, &gt;&gt; HE'S ABLE. &gt;&gt; WHATEVER YOU SAY, &gt;&gt; HE'S ABLE. &gt;&gt; WHATEVER YOU DESIRE, &gt;&gt; HE'S ABLE. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; FLIGHT ATTENDANT, PREPARE FOR LANDING. We can continue. Let me let me strike something and we go my friend. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; That was the first level of faith &gt;&gt; and you passed the test. All of you 100. &gt;&gt; So let me bring the second level &gt;&gt; of faith. &gt;&gt; You can swallow that. &gt;&gt; Are you going to swallow it? &gt;&gt; BROTHER BRANDHAM SAY NOW FAITH WILL DO JUST ANYTHING. L &gt;&gt; I TOLD YOU FAITH IS THE PRECIOUS POWER. IT CAN change &gt;&gt; money. &gt;&gt; Faith the money of God. &gt;&gt; Faith will do how? &gt;&gt; ANYTHING &gt;&gt; THAT YOU HAVE WHAT &gt;&gt; LEADER &gt;&gt; OF BEING DONE IF YOU SUGGEST WHAT? &gt;&gt; PUT IT TO WORK. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. Yes sir. OCCUPY, OCCUPY, OCCUPY. DELIVERY FAITH, BUT OCCUPY. PUT IT TO WORK. PUT IT TO WORK. &gt;&gt; My friend, &gt;&gt; my friend, &gt;&gt; you won't need healing in heaven.

BUT MOST CHURCHES today &gt;&gt; in the message &gt;&gt; THAT IS AS FAR AS THEY TEACH &gt;&gt; JUST DO WHAT? &gt;&gt; ACCEPT JESUS BY FAITH &gt;&gt; AND &gt;&gt; THAT SETTLES IT. &gt;&gt; THAT IS LIKE A MAN &gt;&gt; WAS THAT IS LIKE A MAN WAS THAT WAS EATING A SLICE OF WATER &gt;&gt; WATERMELON. &gt;&gt; He said that was GOOD BUT THERE IS WATER &gt;&gt; some more of IT SOMEWHERE. SO THAT IS THE WAY IT IS TO ACCEPT CHRIST IS WHAT &gt;&gt; GOOD &gt;&gt; BUT THERE IS MORE TO IT &gt;&gt; BELIEVE THE MESSAGE I BELIEVE THE MESSAGE I'M BAPTIZED &gt;&gt; THAT'S NO &gt;&gt; NO BROTHER SAY AND THEN WHEN A MAN DO WHAT &gt;&gt; ACCEPT CHRIST &gt;&gt; AS WHAT &gt;&gt; HIS PERSONAL SAVIOR &gt;&gt; THEN ALL THE GOOD THINGS OH NO, &gt;&gt; NO, NO, NO, NO. YOU ARE HUMBLE. SOME OF THE GOOD THINGS, &gt;&gt; ALL THE WATER, &gt;&gt; ALL THE GOOD THINGS. &gt;&gt; YOU WHO LOVE TRIAL, &gt;&gt; ALL THE BAD THINGS, &gt;&gt; NO SIR. &gt;&gt; ALL THE WATER, &gt;&gt; ALL THE GOOD THINGS. &gt;&gt; THE CHRIST HAS WHAT &gt;&gt; PROMISE &gt;&gt; IS LAYING RIGHT AT WHAT? FINGERTIPS. &gt;&gt; You don't know. &gt;&gt; EVERYTHING YOU NEED OF IS WHERE? &gt;&gt; WHAT DO YOU DO WITH A FINGERTIP? &gt;&gt; PUSH THE BUTTON. &gt;&gt; It's a nap. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? EVERY GOOD THING THAT GOD HAS PROMISED IS LAYING WHERE? &gt;&gt; RIGHT AT HIS FINGERTIPS. &gt;&gt; JUST TO DO WHAT? &gt;&gt; BELIEVE IT. &gt;&gt; BROTHER BRANDHAM CONTINUE. HE SAYS HERE, "AFTER THIS MEETING IS OVER, IF GOD WILLING, WE take our vacation, SISTER SHARON, AND GO UP IN THE MOUNTAINS TO HUNT. &gt;&gt; What good? Oh, sorry. WHAT GOOD DID HE DO THAT MAN TO GIVE HIM A GUN &gt;&gt; IF HE'S NOT GOING TO USE IT? GOD SAVE YOU. GOD HEAL YOU. THE SEVEN THUNDERS THE MYSTERY OF GOD. What good is those mysteries? &gt;&gt; IF THE MYSTERY DON'T BECOME LIFE, &gt;&gt; are we together? IT SAYS IT IS STANDING THERE a water &gt;&gt; find God &gt;&gt; but it shall NEVER DO NO GOOD UNLESS WATER &gt;&gt; HE USES IT. &gt;&gt; THAT IS THE WAY YOUR FAITH IS. &gt;&gt; I DON'T KNOW IF YOU GET ME. &gt;&gt; WHEN I TELL THE young man, &gt;&gt; I say go walk around where they building new houses. &gt;&gt; SOME OF YOU DON'T LISTEN. YOU GOING TO THAT TOWN. GO WHERE NEW HOUSES ARE. YOU MUST PUT IT TO WORK. &gt;&gt; YOU MUST PUSH IT TO WORK. &gt;&gt; YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT I'M SAYING. &gt;&gt; A GROWN UP YOUNG MAN. YOU SEE A NEW NEIGHBORHOOD. &gt;&gt; How are YOU DOING, SIR? I WANT TO SEE THE MODELS. HE WILL BEGIN TO WORK TO BRING A NEW ANOINTING &gt;&gt; ON YOU. &gt;&gt; HE PUT YOU IN THE CHANNEL. &gt;&gt; I don't know if WE TOGETHER. &gt;&gt; BROTHER SAID THAT IS THE WAY YOUR FAITH IS. &gt;&gt; OH, IT IS A WHAT? &gt;&gt; FIND FAITH. &gt;&gt; YOU DO WHAT? &gt;&gt; You read. &gt;&gt; You do what? believe &gt;&gt; and you have a what? &gt;&gt; An experience with God &gt;&gt; AND YOU BELIEVE. YEAH. BUT FAITH WITHOUT WORK IS HOW &gt;&gt; DEAD. &gt;&gt; I hope WE ARE TOGETHER. FAITH WITHOUT WORK IS WHAT? &gt;&gt; DON'T WORRY. I'M GOING TO THE AIRPORT. PUT IT TO WHERE? &gt;&gt; TO WORK. &gt;&gt; DON'T BE SUFFERING. ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; BROTHER BRANDHAM SAYS THIS. HE SAYS, "AND NOW IF PEOPLE WOULD put &gt;&gt; if people would do what? &gt;&gt; IF THE CHURCH WOULD PUT &gt;&gt; MORE &gt;&gt; DO WHAT? That's the word. &gt;&gt; YOU WOULD SEE MORE THINGS TAKING PLACE in the church. &gt;&gt; Listen to me. &gt;&gt; Listen to me. &gt;&gt; I don't care what your problem is. I don't care how difficult it is. &gt;&gt; I don't care how impossible it is. &gt;&gt; I DON'T CARE HOW NO ONE EVER COME OUT OF YOUR OUT OF YOUR SITUATION. &gt;&gt; I DON'T CARE IF NO ONE HAVE A TESTIMONY OF YOUR CASE YET. &gt;&gt; I DON'T CARE. MY POINT IS FOR YOU TO PUT THE work My friend, &gt;&gt; my friend, AREN'T YOU TIRED OF YOUR BRAIN? &gt;&gt; YOU GO TO THE DOCTOR, &gt;&gt; THE DOCTOR tells you clearly &gt;&gt; that there is nothing we can do with this. &gt;&gt; You will stay on medication the rest of your life. IN OTHER WORDS, THE DOCTOR TOLD YOU, "I'M DONE WITH YOU. AND THEN YOU SIT LIKE THIS. &gt;&gt; NO. AND YOU ACCEPT THAT. &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; IF YOU DON'T, IT IS MY TIME TO PUT IT TO WORK. &gt;&gt; I WILL SAY DOCTOR, DOCTOR, &gt;&gt; I APPRECIATE YOU. &gt;&gt; I THANK YOU FOR BEING A GOOD DOCTOR. &gt;&gt; BUT I WANT TO TELL YOU ONE THING. I WILL COME BACK WITH A TESTIMONY. I WILL COME BACK TO TESTIFY THAT MY GOD IS ALIVE. &gt;&gt; I HOPE WE ARE TOGETHER. I HOPE WE ARE TOGETHER. &gt;&gt; I HOPE WE ARE TOGETHER. &gt;&gt; IF NOT, IF NOT, FORGET ABOUT RAPTURING FAITH. BROTHER TONY, I'M GOING TO OPEN THE tire and I'm going to come down. Are we together? Your prayer will be answered soon. I'm going to open the tire and as I'm coming down TOGETHER are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? Come on. COME ON. THE BIBLE BROTHER SAY HE SAYS IF THE PEOPLE WOULD PUT ON IF THE CHURCH &gt;&gt; IF SPOKEN WORD &gt;&gt; VISIBLE AN INVISIBLE AUDIENCE will put &gt;&gt; if the fellow next to you don't want to get it &gt;&gt; tell him you were not born in the same day like me. You came on your own birthday and let me deal with my own life. &gt;&gt; IF YOU'RE NOT INTERESTED, I AM. &gt;&gt; IT'S TALKING ABOUT ME. &gt;&gt; HE SAYS IF THE CHURCH WILL PUT MORE WHAT? &gt;&gt; FAITH TO WORK. &gt;&gt; TO WHAT? &gt;&gt; TO WORK. &gt;&gt; YOU WOULD SEE WHAT &gt;&gt; MORE THINGS TAKING PLACE IN THE CHURCH. &gt;&gt; THE PASTOR MUST STAND ON SUNDAY. &gt;&gt; WHICH SUNDAY? &gt;&gt; MORNING. &gt;&gt; HE MUST STAND ON SUNDAY WHAT &gt;&gt; EVENING &gt;&gt; OR WHAT?

Lord, help this church. Help each individual here and online to put that faith into work. That faith that was once delivered to the saint. Let's put it to work. The faith was already restored by Malachi 4. The problem is not the faith is there. The faith is already there. The faith was delivered once. The faith was broken and restored back. The point is for us to take the faith and put it in the actions. &gt;&gt; You want to see a reaction from us &gt;&gt; that confirm to you that we are believing &gt;&gt; like Abraham. &gt;&gt; And father, this is what we will do. And we know that you keep your word because the problem in the covenant have never been your side. It has been our side. Father, help us through the Holy Spirit to put everything into the work so that Lord, Father, we can reap the benefit of what you die for in Calvary. Lord, protect each one of us. And whoever drove all the way here sick, Lord, remember them and don't let them because they came into the hospital. May they go back with a reassurance that everything is clear. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And with a strength and a healing because you're still the same yesterday, today, and forever. We commit lord father the remaining of this year unto the hand. Father protect us and take the oncoming week unto the hand in the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you church.
