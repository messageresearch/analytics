[51:27] [Applause]
[51:34] because the bride shall not enter into
[51:37] tribulation
[51:39] [Applause]
[51:49] don't worry the pastor will straighten
[51:50] me out
[51:54] amen you know we carry the attack of
[51:58] young minister so we are allowed to make
[52:00] mistakes
[52:03] praise be to God
[52:05] amen
[52:06] God is a god of a variety
[52:10] sometimes it makes you chuckle so that
[52:13] you may remember the sermon
[52:15] amen
[52:17] God has a sense of humor
[52:19] believe that too
[52:21] amen
[52:23] praise be to God
[52:25] many are called
[52:27] but few come to church on Wednesday amen
[52:31] all right let's let's let's go to the
[52:34] reading of the scriptures
[52:39] we hope this is working
[52:51] it's not built
[53:08] amen do you love him anyhow
[53:12] when you see the enemy fighting it means
[53:14] he's already defeated
[53:16] [Applause]
[53:19] you know he he he tries to fight with
[53:21] technology
[53:23] praise be to God
[53:28] let's read maybe from Genesis
[53:45] verse let's do it from verse
[53:50] chapter 2 very sorry about that
[53:54] let's read from verse 7 and the Lord
[53:57] formed Men Out of the Dust of the earth
[54:00] and breathed into his nostrils
[54:04] amen the breath of life and Men became a
[54:09] living soul
[54:10] amen let's pray one more time Heavenly
[54:13] Father we are your children Lord this is
[54:16] Father where we Rejoice this is where we
[54:19] we are happy oh God when we are in
[54:21] church for we are home we know father
[54:24] that we are in our house be with us Lord
[54:26] when you bring father the inspiration
[54:28] from the reading of these words and
[54:31] speak to your children tonight we commit
[54:34] the service into your hands in Jesus
[54:36] Christ's name amen amen God bless you
[54:39] may have your seat
[54:44] maybe I'm pressing the wrong button
[54:46] that's it Oh Praise the Lord yeah so
[54:50] let's also read this scripture
[54:51] Colossians chapter 3 verse 4. we have it
[54:55] on the screen the Bible says when Christ
[54:57] who is our life shall appear then shall
[55:02] we also appear with him in glory amen he
[55:07] says when Christ who is our life
[55:10] so Christ himself is our life today by
[55:14] the grace of God we want to talk about
[55:16] the mystery of our identity
[55:19] amen
[55:21] sometimes when people hear the word
[55:23] mystery to them it's a turn off
[55:26] because it's something that has been
[55:28] abused but if something is abused it
[55:31] doesn't mean it's not right
[55:33] amen praise be to God anything can be
[55:37] abused
[55:38] Hallelujah a cause can be abused drugs
[55:42] can be abused but you don't stop taking
[55:45] medicine because some people are abusing
[55:49] medicine
[55:50] amen praise be to God
[55:53] this picture has been abused but we
[55:56] cannot stop using it just because
[55:59] someone is abusive
[56:01] amen
[56:04] amen some people have been in abusive
[56:07] marriages but we cannot abolish marriage
[56:10] because there's been abuses
[56:14] Hallelujah
[56:15] praise be to God
[56:17] so when we say a mystery we are talking
[56:21] about something that was previously
[56:23] hidden but now has been divinely
[56:27] revealed
[56:28] amen and the key word is divinely
[56:31] revealed amen no doubt it could be
[56:35] revealed but the question is was it
[56:38] divinely revealed so something is
[56:41] divinely revealed if it's revealed by
[56:44] the inspiration of the Holy Ghost
[56:47] is divinely revealed when it's thus says
[56:51] the Lord It's divinely revealed when
[56:55] when when when when when the messenger
[56:57] catches the mystery of it and it brings
[57:00] it to the people
[57:02] Hallelujah so when we say it a mystery
[57:06] we are preaching something that has
[57:08] already been revealed
[57:11] we are not revealing the Bible we are
[57:14] preaching what has already been revealed
[57:17] and brother Branham was a prophet
[57:20] and he was a revealer of the word of God
[57:24] and he had the mystery
[57:26] of the word for this age
[57:29] amen
[57:31] and by by him being the messenger he
[57:35] revealed to ask the word of God
[57:37] and we as ministers as Levites we are
[57:41] not revealing the word we are preaching
[57:44] what has already been revealed
[57:48] Hallelujah because the Bible says in the
[57:52] days of the son of man
[57:54] so in the days of the seventh angel when
[57:57] he shall begin to sound
[57:58] the midst of God shall be finished and
[58:02] the Bible says that Elijah
[58:04] shall restore all things
[58:07] amen
[58:09] he may he didn't have time to explain a
[58:12] lot of things
[58:13] he could say if I if I had time I could
[58:16] spend four months on this one or six
[58:19] months on this one but he said I believe
[58:21] that men shall come and take this word
[58:25] and sweep it to the coming of the Lord
[58:27] and make more sense to it
[58:30] Hallelujah that's the continuation of
[58:34] the ministry
[58:36] Hallelujah
[58:37] amen and God bless you thank you so much
[58:40] for pulling tonight
[58:43] I I I I I I I was praying and I said I'm
[58:46] gonna be teaching tonight
[58:48] amen so I I appreciate the amens but I
[58:53] hope you will bear with me tonight
[58:58] this this church pulls so much before
[59:02] you know it you leave your notes
[59:06] you know they are they are restaurants
[59:08] like that they will bombard you with
[59:10] very good starters
[59:12] before you know it you're full
[59:14] they said sir here is your main yes your
[59:18] menu for your for your main dish
[59:20] said wow I'm already full
[59:24] after one hour you know you you haven't
[59:27] touched your nose but that's good
[59:29] sometimes that's what the Holy Ghost
[59:31] wants
[59:32] Amen to leave your notes into Justice go
[59:35] as the Lord is leading
[59:37] amen
[59:39] but we know that we are living in an age
[59:41] where we need teaching if there's
[59:44] something that we have been lacking in
[59:46] this age is teaching very good Bible
[59:49] teaching
[59:50] amen because teaching establishes the
[59:53] church
[59:54] praise be to God because we have to come
[59:57] to maturity
[59:58] remember last time we spoke about
[1:00:00] maturity and maturity can only come when
[1:00:04] we realize Who We Are
[1:00:07] amen and if when we are positionally
[1:00:09] placed through the teaching of the word
[1:00:13] Hallelujah because remember in Acts
[1:00:16] chapter 11 verse 23. the Bible says that
[1:00:20] that's where they were first called
[1:00:22] Christians and it was at a place called
[1:00:25] Antioch
[1:00:26] now Antioch was a city that separated
[1:00:30] the east from the West
[1:00:32] Hallelujah so Antioch is more like when
[1:00:36] the East and the West meet
[1:00:38] and they call it the creator of
[1:00:40] Christianity
[1:00:42] Hallelujah and the Jews they were
[1:00:45] running away from persecution from the
[1:00:48] time of Stephen and they were going all
[1:00:50] over and and they were going as far as
[1:00:53] Antioch and they were preaching in
[1:00:55] Antioch and there were many disciples
[1:00:57] that were converted at Antioch
[1:00:59] Hallelujah so when when that when the
[1:01:02] apostles that were at Jerusalem they
[1:01:05] heard that they were Christians they
[1:01:06] were people that had received the
[1:01:08] message in Antioch they've sent Barnabas
[1:01:12] Hallelujah a type of the five-fold
[1:01:15] ministry and when Barnabas came to
[1:01:17] Antioch and he saw that these people
[1:01:19] love the world what did Barnabas do
[1:01:22] verse 24 he went and found Saul
[1:01:26] of tasers
[1:01:27] Hallelujah and when he found soul of
[1:01:30] Texas he brought him to Antioch
[1:01:33] Hallelujah and the Bible says in the
[1:01:36] book of Acts that the they taught the
[1:01:38] word for two years
[1:01:42] going through the Bible going through
[1:01:44] the Hebrew Series going through adoption
[1:01:47] going through the silver for two years
[1:01:50] and after two years they were first
[1:01:53] called Christians at Antioch
[1:01:58] Hallelujah
[1:02:00] praise be to God after two years of good
[1:02:03] teaching they were called Christians at
[1:02:06] Antioch
[1:02:07] Hallelujah
[1:02:08] it's Antioch where the East and the West
[1:02:11] meet and brother Brahm says we have come
[1:02:14] to a place where the East and the West
[1:02:18] is metagana
[1:02:21] Hallelujah and the word yes to be
[1:02:23] revealed one more time
[1:02:25] [Applause]
[1:02:27] yes
[1:02:28] praise be to God
[1:02:31] Hallelujah because we have to come to
[1:02:33] Perfection now the word perfection
[1:02:38] it just it has two meanings all right
[1:02:41] can I can I use
[1:02:43] maybe I'll get some of brother Stevens
[1:02:45] an anointing here
[1:02:49] one meaning of the word Perfection is
[1:02:53] sinless
[1:02:55] right
[1:02:57] and this is what people think when they
[1:02:59] hear the words perfect
[1:03:02] they say something has to be sinless
[1:03:04] or or blameless
[1:03:07] when they see someone who has got
[1:03:09] freckles or pimples they say she's not
[1:03:11] perfect
[1:03:13] because our idea of perfect
[1:03:17] is something that is sinless or spotless
[1:03:22] which is fine
[1:03:24] and then the second meaning of the word
[1:03:26] amen this one is maturity
[1:03:30] amen
[1:03:33] that's the other word for what for
[1:03:35] Perfection it's maturity
[1:03:38] amen we don't have time to go back to
[1:03:40] the Bible it's maturity is completeness
[1:03:42] Right amen completeness
[1:03:52] amen so this one only Christ is pretty
[1:03:57] sinless
[1:03:58] and we ourselves can never be sinless
[1:04:00] except through faith in Christ
[1:04:03] because he is our righteousness so no
[1:04:07] matter how good you are you can never be
[1:04:10] sinless because of your nature
[1:04:13] amen you may say brother Aaron has never
[1:04:16] touched a woman what about your thoughts
[1:04:20] what about your thoughts what are you
[1:04:22] thinking right now
[1:04:24] it's because of your nature so so
[1:04:26] because of our nature we can never be
[1:04:30] righteous except through Jesus Christ
[1:04:34] he is our righteousness and that's why
[1:04:37] we call him Jehovah
[1:04:38] the Lord is our righteousness
[1:04:40] [Applause]
[1:04:41] [Music]
[1:04:42] amen and the other words for Perfection
[1:04:45] is maturity or completeness so when we
[1:04:49] say that he gave the five-fold ministry
[1:04:53] for the perfecting of the Saints we are
[1:04:56] not saying for this that they may become
[1:04:59] seamless no we are saying they may come
[1:05:01] to the maturity
[1:05:04] Hallelujah
[1:05:06] Hallelujah so when you come to the
[1:05:09] maturity you have come to you can
[1:05:12] nothing can be added to something when
[1:05:14] it is mature
[1:05:16] amen it's full it's complete
[1:05:20] Hallelujah so each seeds amen Psalms
[1:05:25] chapter one Hallelujah he brings forth
[1:05:27] his fruit in his season
[1:05:31] so in the time of Luther
[1:05:33] the maturity was for you to come to
[1:05:36] justification
[1:05:37] amen
[1:05:39] Hallelujah but at the end of the age we
[1:05:42] must come to full maturity where we
[1:05:45] become the full word of God
[1:05:47] [Applause]
[1:05:49] Hallelujah
[1:05:51] but you see here is where the devil
[1:05:53] confuses you if you are on your journey
[1:05:56] to maturity and then you make a mistake
[1:05:59] and then the devil says you're finished
[1:06:01] because you're not perfect but he is
[1:06:04] confusing this and this that's exactly
[1:06:07] like
[1:06:08] Hallelujah just because you make a
[1:06:10] mistake there's no doesn't mean you're
[1:06:13] not perfect you are perfect before
[1:06:15] Christ yes sir because the sacrifice was
[1:06:18] perfect yes
[1:06:20] [Applause]
[1:06:23] Hallelujah you have not yet come to
[1:06:25] maturity but you are perfect
[1:06:28] [Applause]
[1:06:32] Hallelujah
[1:06:33] [Applause]
[1:06:34] so now
[1:06:36] so in Genesis God was creating life
[1:06:41] created marine life he created bird life
[1:06:45] he created he was going up creating life
[1:06:49] and when yet come you know the prophet
[1:06:51] says that that the lowest full of life
[1:06:54] is a frog
[1:06:56] and where does he get it from it's
[1:06:59] because when God was creating life he
[1:07:01] was growing up up up up up up
[1:07:04] and on the seventh he says on the sixth
[1:07:06] day he says let us create men
[1:07:08] in our own image in our own likeness so
[1:07:12] the highest form of life
[1:07:15] amen is God
[1:07:19] the highest form of life is Zoe
[1:07:21] Hallelujah
[1:07:23] praise me to God
[1:07:25] Hallelujah so the highest form of life
[1:07:27] is not driving a Rolls-Royce the highest
[1:07:31] form of life is not living in a mansion
[1:07:34] the highest form of life is God
[1:07:38] [Applause]
[1:07:41] sorry
[1:07:42] amen
[1:07:44] this is
[1:07:47] life according to the order of creation
[1:07:49] Hallelujah and it has to be in the image
[1:07:52] of God and in the likeness of God
[1:07:55] that's why when God came to Israel
[1:07:59] he said be holy
[1:08:01] for what reason because I the Lord your
[1:08:05] God I am Holy in other words you are
[1:08:08] supposed to be me because I am sure
[1:08:14] Hallelujah so we are talking about
[1:08:17] identity tonight
[1:08:19] you know people
[1:08:21] they try to to put a tattoo on their
[1:08:24] body to be unique
[1:08:27] they try to you know you know the tint
[1:08:29] their hair to all kinds of things to to
[1:08:31] make themselves unique
[1:08:33] but if you're a Christian you are
[1:08:36] already unique because you have the life
[1:08:38] of God
[1:08:43] amen
[1:08:44] there is nothing that you can add to
[1:08:46] subject you have the highest form of
[1:08:49] life
[1:08:51] God has already made you different
[1:08:54] you you don't have to do anything to
[1:08:57] make yourself Special by being a Son of
[1:09:00] God that makes you special
[1:09:03] and you cannot go higher than God
[1:09:07] when God created man nothing was created
[1:09:11] he said I am going to take a rest
[1:09:14] so if you try to go higher you're
[1:09:16] actually going backwards
[1:09:19] amen
[1:09:20] you can try to put some earrings you can
[1:09:23] try to you are just going backwards the
[1:09:26] highest you can go is to become like God
[1:09:31] hallelujah praise be to God
[1:09:36] what manner of love the father is
[1:09:39] bestowed upon us that we must be called
[1:09:42] the sons of God
[1:09:47] he didn't say
[1:09:49] what manner of love the father has
[1:09:51] bestowed upon us that we drive a Bentley
[1:10:00] behold what manner of love
[1:10:03] amen
[1:10:05] that the father has bestowed upon us
[1:10:08] that we live in an expensive suburb we
[1:10:11] live in expensive not sir
[1:10:14] is there anything wrong with those
[1:10:16] things no
[1:10:17] but that is not what we are trying to
[1:10:20] achieve
[1:10:22] the Bible says seek ye first the kingdom
[1:10:25] of God as he is righteousness and all
[1:10:28] these things shall be added
[1:10:32] the problem with people is that they are
[1:10:35] trying to put the cut before the horse
[1:10:37] it's a professional they try to fall
[1:10:41] after Prosperity if you are a son of God
[1:10:44] which you don't fall out the prosperity
[1:10:47] Prosperity follows you amen
[1:10:51] because David said surely goodness and
[1:10:54] mercy follow me all the days of my life
[1:10:58] pray to my blood
[1:11:00] amen
[1:11:01] praise be to God yes my brother
[1:11:04] people are busy they were looking for
[1:11:06] for for mining minds and gold you know
[1:11:08] in the in the early days California they
[1:11:11] call it they call it the Golden State
[1:11:13] because people went there because of the
[1:11:15] gold rush you know people looking for
[1:11:17] goats I'm looking for oil brother pranam
[1:11:20] would be sitting in a restaurant eating
[1:11:22] spaghetti or Panic pancakes and the Lord
[1:11:25] would show him oil cracks in America
[1:11:29] these things were following him but
[1:11:31] there were people who were skipping
[1:11:34] ropes and skipping Bridges to find mind
[1:11:37] claims

[1:12:59] [Applause]
[1:13:04] Hallelujah
[1:13:05] [Applause]

[1:13:18] Hallelujah
[1:13:20] our identity
[1:13:22] we have an identity crisis
[1:13:25] the devil attacks identity
[1:13:28] we are living in a time where young
[1:13:30] people there is a debate
[1:13:33] whether they can be called a man or a
[1:13:35] woman
[1:13:36] that's how far the devil is gone
[1:13:39] destroying people's identity
[1:13:42] amen
[1:13:44] when when the prophet saw it
[1:13:47] he said the prophet when he speaks he's
[1:13:49] not looking at today
[1:13:52] he looks at hundreds years down the road
[1:13:54] when the Bible says men shall not put
[1:13:57] clothes that pertain to a woman and a
[1:14:00] woman that pertains to a man
[1:14:03] people thought well he's just you know
[1:14:05] the Bible is just being hot
[1:14:06] but now look at the problem
[1:14:10] ah you know we know what is a woman ah
[1:14:13] we don't know what is a woman
[1:14:15] identity
[1:14:18] so the enemy attacks our identity
[1:14:22] when when Russia invaded Ukraine one of
[1:14:26] the first things that they did
[1:14:28] they were destroying a cultural places
[1:14:32] of Ukraine
[1:14:33] because they wanted to destroy the
[1:14:35] Ukrainian identity
[1:14:38] they destroyed you know the biggest
[1:14:40] airplane was from Ukraine amen they just
[1:14:43] they destroyed it because they did not
[1:14:45] want them to have an identity
[1:14:49] Hallelujah even when people joined
[1:14:52] criminal gangs the first thing they do
[1:14:54] is they change their name
[1:14:57] and you know they say okay now you this
[1:14:59] is the your new family
[1:15:01] and this is your identity and that's
[1:15:04] what the devil does and that's what the
[1:15:07] devil has been doing in this age
[1:15:08] [Applause]
[1:15:10] Hallelujah
[1:15:11] when Daniel shared with Meshach and I
[1:15:14] bet Nico went into Babylon the first
[1:15:17] thing that the king did he said I'm
[1:15:20] going to change your names up
[1:15:23] so that you forget who you are preach my
[1:15:26] brother
[1:15:26] Hallelujah
[1:15:29] and he said You shall not be called
[1:15:31] Daniel you shall be called built a shaza
[1:15:36] the prince of The Magicians
[1:15:38] amen and enticing them
[1:15:42] and you know what he was a prophet but
[1:15:45] the devil tried to to pervert that gift
[1:15:49] Hallelujah
[1:15:51] praise be to God every single that we
[1:15:54] have in the world came from the church
[1:15:56] whether it's Elvis Presley Michael
[1:15:59] Michael Jackson they all came from
[1:16:01] church
[1:16:03] [Applause]
[1:16:05] so he attacks the identity he said your
[1:16:09] name is changed you shall not be called
[1:16:11] Daniel you shall be called uh built to
[1:16:14] shaza amen and the next thing we're
[1:16:17] gonna change your diet
[1:16:20] amen
[1:16:21] we are going to change your diet
[1:16:24] you are going to eat the king's meat
[1:16:27] amen and look at how the devil likes to
[1:16:30] frame this the Kings meet
[1:16:33] something it sounds very very fancy
[1:16:36] Hallelujah this is the King's meat this
[1:16:39] is the best best brisket in all of
[1:16:42] Southern America
[1:16:48] you think I'm talking about meat
[1:16:50] I'm talking about spiritual diet
[1:16:54] checks this word
[1:16:57] and he brings a new diet he brings
[1:17:00] Netflix up he brings Hulu he brings this
[1:17:02] he brings that he brings data until the
[1:17:05] diet is changed
[1:17:08] Hallelujah
[1:17:11] but Daniel said we shall not give the
[1:17:14] king's portions we shall eat vegetables
[1:17:17] we shall eat the Bible we shall eat the
[1:17:20] message of the hour
[1:17:24] that's why God said to Joshua
[1:17:27] be strong and courageous
[1:17:30] not to fight people
[1:17:32] but to keep the word
[1:17:34] not to turn to the left or to the writer
[1:17:37] that takes courage
[1:17:39] [Music]
[1:17:42] hallelujah praise me to Carter
[1:17:46] and this was the second Babylon remember
[1:17:50] there are three Babylons in the in the
[1:17:52] Bible the first one was the Babylon of
[1:17:55] nimrod we don't have time to go into
[1:17:57] that and there's the Babylon of
[1:17:59] nebuchadnezza and we are in the last
[1:18:01] mystery Babylon and the devil is still
[1:18:04] doing the same tricks
[1:18:06] [Music]
[1:18:09] when the decree came from from Nehemiah
[1:18:12] and Israel they were like three decrees
[1:18:14] to go back to Israel
[1:18:16] only a few people went
[1:18:18] wise because they'd lost their identity
[1:18:22] they had become used to Babylon they
[1:18:25] were used to going to work every every
[1:18:27] day they didn't care about going to
[1:18:29] church they didn't care about family
[1:18:31] outers they had completely changed their
[1:18:35] identity
[1:18:38] that's why God had to bring a
[1:18:40] persecution for Jews to go back to their
[1:18:43] homelands otherwise they were not going
[1:18:46] to go back
[1:18:48] because they'd lost their identity
[1:18:53] they they got European names
[1:18:56] amen
[1:18:59] Vladimir zelensky that's a Hebrew that's
[1:19:02] a Hebrew boy
[1:19:03] but now he is
[1:19:06] amen but you look at this nose they say
[1:19:09] this is a Hebrew
[1:19:11] amen
[1:19:13] Albert Einstein
[1:19:15] Hebrews Jews hey man you lose your
[1:19:19] identity over time
[1:19:25] identity Marion Webster says it's the
[1:19:27] distinguishing character or a
[1:19:30] personality of an individual so what
[1:19:33] distinguishes us as Believers it's not
[1:19:37] the church that we go through it's the
[1:19:39] holy spirit it's Christ in moffatt in US
[1:19:44] amen
[1:19:46] let's read here according the prophet
[1:19:47] says you have to have a credation or a
[1:19:51] card or a fellowship card or something
[1:19:53] to identify yourself
[1:19:55] as well they know where you come from
[1:19:58] and where you're going to say at the
[1:20:00] platform you have to be identified and
[1:20:03] it's identifying age
[1:20:07] amen you have to identify yourself they
[1:20:11] came to John they said give us your
[1:20:14] identity
[1:20:15] who ask you
[1:20:19] you didn't say Hey listen I'm drawn my
[1:20:22] father's name was Zechariah he was a
[1:20:24] priest no sir he identified himself by
[1:20:28] the word he said I am the foreign
[1:20:37] [Applause]
[1:20:45] like the colored woman from Memphis
[1:20:47] Tennessee she said I am the shinamide
[1:20:49] woman where is my Elijah
[1:20:53] identification time
[1:20:55] who are you identified with tonight
[1:20:57] [Music]
[1:21:04] I identified with the football stars
[1:21:07] some are identified with music stars but
[1:21:11] we I am identified with Malachi 4.
[1:21:14] [Music]
[1:21:16] Hallelujah
[1:21:17] praise be to God
[1:21:19] we have to we have to know our identity
[1:21:22] because our identity is connected with
[1:21:26] your origin and our origin is connected
[1:21:29] with our destiny
[1:21:32] [Music]
[1:21:35] promises
[1:21:37] I was with Elijah in the days of ihab
[1:21:40] went there to make a choice who they
[1:21:43] would serve God obey them amen we we was
[1:21:47] with him on Mount Carmel
[1:21:49] amen when he had to make the choice for
[1:21:52] we are identified in the body of the
[1:21:55] same God that he was identified in so if
[1:21:59] we were identified in that body then we
[1:22:01] must remember we were with him that's
[1:22:05] right so Elijah said I was with the
[1:22:09] prophecies I was with Elijah on Mount
[1:22:10] Carmel
[1:22:12] and to remember there are three
[1:22:14] showdowns the prophet says this and the
[1:22:17] last Showdown is this one it's called
[1:22:19] the Mount Zion Showdown
[1:22:22] and for every Showdown there has to be
[1:22:24] critics
[1:22:26] they cannot be a showdown without
[1:22:28] critics
[1:22:31] they have to be websites huh that rise
[1:22:34] up and concise the message
[1:22:37] they have to be people that big slider
[1:22:40] oh that's they can be a showdown
[1:22:44] whether the message is right or not
[1:22:48] amen
[1:22:50] the people had lost their identity
[1:22:53] and to Elijah to come
[1:22:55] and because remember the spirit of
[1:22:57] Elijah
[1:22:58] is the cure
[1:23:00] for a a a a a lukewarmness
[1:23:05] it's a cure for being double-minded
[1:23:08] because when Elijah repaired the outer
[1:23:11] yes and he prayed he said Lord yes that
[1:23:13] they may not that's you are the true
[1:23:16] gods and I am your servant
[1:23:20] number one
[1:23:21] they have to know that I am the true God
[1:23:24] that you are the true gods
[1:23:29] secondly yes
[1:23:31] I am your servant
[1:23:33] that's very important don't stop here
[1:23:38] amen
[1:23:40] I am your servant
[1:23:47] number three
[1:23:49] in that you have sent me
[1:23:57] and you are telling you are turning
[1:23:58] their hearts so these people that was
[1:24:01] Mount Carmel and at Mount Zion the same
[1:24:05] thing has to happen your heart cannot be
[1:24:07] turned until you see the true God and
[1:24:10] you see his servant
[1:24:12] and that's when you can know that the
[1:24:15] Mysteries that were spoken it was not
[1:24:18] William Branham it was Jesus Christ
[1:24:21] speaking of the church
[1:24:23] Hallelujah
[1:24:25] praise me to God because Elijah said how
[1:24:29] long
[1:24:30] shall you stand between two opinions
[1:24:33] and you know that's that's the problem
[1:24:35] with the people
[1:24:36] they they get an amnesia until they lose
[1:24:40] the identity and they are standing
[1:24:43] between two opinions
[1:24:45] and whenever that Spirit comes upon the
[1:24:47] Earth
[1:24:48] God has to send Elijah he has to send
[1:24:51] the spirit of Elijah
[1:24:53] amen
[1:24:54] so now we find out that when Elijah came
[1:24:56] on Mount Carmel now these people now
[1:24:59] when you are in between
[1:25:01] it is what we call spiritual nightmare
[1:25:04] the prophet says it's when you are
[1:25:06] caught between two dimensions
[1:25:08] the purpose is when you are having a
[1:25:10] nightmare
[1:25:12] you are caught between two Dimensions
[1:25:14] you are not awake and you are not asleep
[1:25:18] you are in between dimensions
[1:25:21] Hallelujah and brother helped many
[1:25:24] people that were in between Dimensions
[1:25:28] because the spirit of Elijah
[1:25:31] amen that's what it does so that's what
[1:25:34] was The Showdown at Mount Carmel
[1:25:37] he had to give them back their identity
[1:25:41] that they were Hebrews
[1:25:43] [Music]
[1:25:44] amen
[1:25:45] [Music]
[1:25:48] comes
[1:25:51] says if God be God save him
[1:25:54] shall we serve God shall we serve the
[1:25:55] denominations
[1:25:57] amen
[1:26:00] and after the head held their peace
[1:26:02] James Anthony saying men and Brethren
[1:26:05] hacking unto me
[1:26:07] Simeon has declared now God at the first
[1:26:10] did visit the Gentiles to take out of
[1:26:13] them a people for his name
[1:26:15] no no no God the prophet gives us One
[1:26:20] important principle in the scripture
[1:26:22] one of the principles is that
[1:26:24] God deals with Gentiles as individuals
[1:26:29] and he deals with Jews as groups as a
[1:26:33] group
[1:26:34] when you read 104 000 they were saved in
[1:26:37] one day
[1:26:38] that's what Isaiah said we have seen
[1:26:40] such a thing before Zion traveled she
[1:26:44] brought forth her children
[1:26:46] but Gentiles are not served as a group
[1:26:50] now as simple as it sounds
[1:26:52] a lot of people get confused by that
[1:26:55] because you know the devil is especially
[1:26:58] now there is a pressure
[1:27:00] of groups
[1:27:02] there's a pressure of tricks and plants
[1:27:06] and people want to be associated with
[1:27:09] movements and things and and that and
[1:27:13] social gatherings
[1:27:15] but you know what I'm not I'm not we
[1:27:18] listen we can never run away from groups
[1:27:21] yes you have a family group you have a
[1:27:23] work group that's all not what I'm
[1:27:25] talking about
[1:27:26] but our Salvation is Gentiles is not a
[1:27:31] group salvation
[1:27:34] that's why there is no specific local
[1:27:38] church
[1:27:39] that is going in the rapture
[1:27:41] the Rapture is for individuals
[1:27:44] [Applause]
[1:27:47] and one thing that you see you will
[1:27:49] never see eagles flying as a group
[1:27:53] eagles they don't fly as a group
[1:27:57] [Applause]
[1:27:59] they fly as individuals
[1:28:02] there's an individual revelation
[1:28:05] [Applause]
[1:28:08] Hallelujah
[1:28:12] the prophet said what is the new birth
[1:28:15] what is a new birth
[1:28:18] it's a personal revelation of Jesus to
[1:28:22] shoot
[1:28:24] is not a group revelation
[1:28:27] don't say oh they are doing this or in
[1:28:29] the message they're allowing this who
[1:28:32] are they
[1:28:33] who are there
[1:28:36] it's your personal revelation
[1:28:39] even if my my husband's backslide I will
[1:28:43] continue honor even if my pastor breaks
[1:28:45] lighter I'll continue on her
[1:28:47] it's an artificial revelation
[1:28:51] [Applause]
[1:28:52] we are talking about your identity you
[1:28:55] don't belong to a grouper you belong to
[1:28:58] the mystical body of Jesus Christ
[1:29:04] amen
[1:29:05] that's the problem with young people
[1:29:08] they get accomplished what everyone in
[1:29:10] school is doing this everyone is doing
[1:29:13] this
[1:29:14] you don't have to do what everyone is
[1:29:16] doing
[1:29:17] there's no one that ever succeeded by
[1:29:20] following a group
[1:29:21] [Applause]
[1:29:23] you can matter of fact you can never
[1:29:26] make money doing what everyone is doing
[1:29:29] you have to solve a unique problem
[1:29:33] you have to have something unique and
[1:29:36] different
[1:29:37] or because the spirit of fashion is the
[1:29:41] spirit of Babylon
[1:29:43] uniformity
[1:29:45] this is all that we do as a group
[1:29:48] and you know because we are living in
[1:29:50] the Harvest Time
[1:29:51] where that that shaft is being bound
[1:29:54] together
[1:29:55] Hallelujah
[1:29:57] and the way it is being gathered
[1:29:58] together in the world
[1:30:00] you have to be very careful of groups
[1:30:03] [Music]
[1:30:07] listen even in the same church if you
[1:30:10] see something doing someone doing
[1:30:12] something wrong don't fall after them
[1:30:14] [Applause]
[1:30:18] amen
[1:30:19] don't say well wow he said oh he's an
[1:30:21] office better that doesn't matter
[1:30:23] anything say Lord help my brother you
[1:30:26] continue on your journey Lord help my
[1:30:28] sister she'll continue on your journey
[1:30:30] because it's an individual affair
[1:30:35] [Applause]
[1:30:38] Enoch could not have been raptured if he
[1:30:41] was doing what everyone was doing
[1:30:43] but when he was 300 years old
[1:30:46] he began to walk with God
[1:30:48] and what is to walk with God people
[1:30:51] think to work with God is you know when
[1:30:53] he was working with you side by side
[1:30:55] that's that's what they show you in the
[1:30:58] in the movies
[1:31:02] you know when you see in the pictures
[1:31:04] like the Jehovah sweetness they draw a
[1:31:06] picture of you and Jesus
[1:31:11] that's not what it means to say you are
[1:31:14] walking with God
[1:31:16] first of all you have to know who is God
[1:31:19] God is a spirit
[1:31:21] so to walk with God is to walk in the
[1:31:24] spirit because the sons of God are led
[1:31:27] by the spirit of God
[1:31:33] Hallelujah when you walk in the spirit
[1:31:35] you are walking with God
[1:31:39] when you walk in the flesh
[1:31:41] you're not working with God
[1:31:47] amen
[1:31:49] in The Exodus oh my
[1:31:52] hahaha
[1:31:55] but I
[1:31:58] one time you know the service was long
[1:32:01] and an elder said if I don't let my
[1:32:03] people go
[1:32:13] Exodus chapter 1 verse 17.
[1:32:16] but against any of the children of
[1:32:18] Israel shall not a dog move his tongue
[1:32:21] against men or beast but that he may
[1:32:24] know how that the Lord put a difference
[1:32:26] is God that puts the difference
[1:32:30] between Israel and Egypt
[1:32:32] we don't differentiate ourselves we
[1:32:36] don't separate ourselves seemingly
[1:32:39] it's the Lord that makes a difference
[1:32:42] amen
[1:32:45] the True Church of Jesus Christ the
[1:32:48] bride is likened unto pure gold
[1:32:50] hair righteousness is his righteousness
[1:32:53] her attributes are his own glorious
[1:32:55] attributes her identity is found in him
[1:33:00] what he is she is to reflect what he has
[1:33:05] she is to manifest so the true church is
[1:33:09] identified with Jesus Christ
[1:33:13] amen
[1:33:16] I just need to read one or two quotes
[1:33:18] and then I'll close you bear with me
[1:33:20] amen
[1:33:24] it's like almost nine right now So
[1:33:28] Daniel
[1:33:29] I think we spoke about this they changed
[1:33:31] his name his name meant God is my judge
[1:33:34] and they changed to be
[1:33:36] in hananya God is my God is favored and
[1:33:41] and they changed to Shadrach
[1:33:43] amen
[1:33:45] such a beautiful name and the devil

[1:37:22] book saying you are catering too much to
[1:37:24] the people

[1:37:28] putting too much emphasis on those signs
[1:37:32] that's what God Said to the prophets
[1:37:34] you are working with too many people
[1:37:37] and sometimes we get into trouble
[1:37:39] because we are trying to cater for too
[1:37:42] many people
[1:37:43] now I'm not saying we should separate
[1:37:45] ourselves
[1:37:47] I'm saying we should leave
[1:37:49] a separated life

[1:41:05] home when you enter my home my home will
[1:41:08] give you a message
[1:41:11] amen when you sit with me and my
[1:41:13] children and my wife you will know who I
[1:41:16] am
[1:41:16] I don't have to show you what I'm eating
[1:41:19] I don't have to show you my couch I
[1:41:22] don't have to show you how my bedroom
[1:41:24] look
[1:41:25] where is this thing coming from
[1:41:27] wordliness
[1:41:30] and I'm gonna say it clearly because I
[1:41:33] know how to put myself in trouble and
[1:41:35] get out of it everybody okay everybody
[1:41:38] okay many message believer have lost
[1:41:41] their identity
[1:41:46] watch on social media watch what people
[1:41:49] are doing they have completely lost they
[1:41:52] don't even know who they are
[1:41:54] if you understand what is the caliber of
[1:41:58] a message believer you will even watch
[1:42:01] what you're doing
[1:42:03] and I was telling someone recently I say
[1:42:06] we the parent we are confusing the young
[1:42:10] people
[1:42:10] [Music]
[1:42:13] there you know I don't know if you get
[1:42:15] me
[1:42:16] the pastor is preaching something
[1:42:19] amen
[1:42:21] the brother and the parent are listening
[1:42:24] the same thing but when they go home the
[1:42:27] younger child is expecting the parent to
[1:42:30] leave what he heard the pastor preaching
[1:42:33] but when he turned around daddy's not
[1:42:35] leaving what the Practical is saying
[1:42:38] now the young man is confused
[1:42:42] so now by the behavior of the parent the
[1:42:46] word of God Becomes of non-effect
[1:42:50] because Mommy never thought before she's
[1:42:53] doing what she's doing because daddy
[1:42:55] never thought what is he doing before
[1:42:57] he's doing what he's doing
[1:42:59] mommy has a Personal Agenda Daddy has a
[1:43:02] Personal Agenda and the children are
[1:43:05] calling for something higher and they
[1:43:07] look at Mommy Mommy doesn't read the
[1:43:09] Bible and but they're telling the
[1:43:11] children to read the Bible but mommy
[1:43:13] never read the Bible she's always on the
[1:43:15] phone
[1:43:16] you are confusing the identity of the
[1:43:20] children
[1:43:21] we telling children go read the 70 weeks
[1:43:23] of Daniel we're telling the young people
[1:43:25] go read the church edges mom is always
[1:43:29] on the social media mom is always
[1:43:31] looking for something else that is
[1:43:33] always doing this and this and this they
[1:43:36] never seen a true Christian Life that
[1:43:39] have been expressed before the children
[1:43:40] that's where the biggest crisis is
[1:43:43] that's why brother Branham say it is not
[1:43:46] children delinquency it is what parent
[1:43:49] delinquency if you don't come to church
[1:43:52] how are you going to teach your children
[1:43:54] to go to church
[1:43:56] if you don't pray how are you going to
[1:43:58] teach your children to pray
[1:44:01] everybody okay everybody okay
[1:44:03] if you don't clap hand in church how do
[1:44:06] you expect your child to clap hand in
[1:44:08] church
[1:44:09] if you don't say a man in church how do
[1:44:12] you expect your boy or your girl to say
[1:44:14] a man in church
[1:44:18] everybody okay if you don't come to
[1:44:20] question and answer how do you expect
[1:44:22] your children when they grow up to be in
[1:44:25] question and answer why how do you
[1:44:27] expect your children when there is
[1:44:28] prayer for them to come to pray
[1:44:32] you never showed up in the Lord's Supper
[1:44:34] how do you expect them to be in the
[1:44:36] Lord's Supper what desire do they have
[1:44:38] to have in the Lord's Supper
[1:44:40] we are confusing the young people by our
[1:44:43] Behavior
[1:44:46] that's why you see young people out of
[1:44:48] the message young people out of the
[1:44:50] message
[1:44:51] brother I deal with a lot of families
[1:44:53] not even in this church outside of this
[1:44:56] church I have people that I deal with my
[1:44:59] wife is there I was called to a funeral
[1:45:01] I sat down just a few minutes with
[1:45:04] somebody there are people that were
[1:45:05] there in few minutes the Lord showed me
[1:45:07] what was going on in that person's life
[1:45:09] and I told him straight ahead and I even
[1:45:11] told him I said if I sit with you two
[1:45:13] hours I will tell you more about your
[1:45:15] life
[1:45:18] what is going on what identity are we
[1:45:22] projecting in a home what identity are
[1:45:25] we projecting in our work what identity
[1:45:28] are we projecting at the restaurant
[1:45:31] what are we doing when that waitress is
[1:45:33] coming
[1:45:34] what are we doing when we're in school
[1:45:37] what are we projecting
[1:45:39] are we projecting what you've been
[1:45:41] preaching here
[1:45:43] or as soon as you leave this church
[1:45:46] you put it down and you have your own
[1:45:48] stuff that you have to do and message
[1:45:50] believer have developed two lives
[1:45:53] they have this Sunday
[1:45:55] service on Wednesday service life versus
[1:45:58] their own life so they go to church like
[1:46:01] religion when they go out they will do
[1:46:04] exactly whatever they want to do even
[1:46:06] though it's contrary to what they have
[1:46:08] been preaching Church they will still do
[1:46:10] it
[1:46:12] you don't know who you are
[1:46:15] wake up
[1:46:16] we need to find our identity
[1:46:19] amen the true you is not this one
[1:46:23] the true you is not the one that was
[1:46:25] born from your mother the true you is
[1:46:27] the predestinated city your true
[1:46:30] identity you are an eternal Son of God
[1:46:33] from eternity
[1:46:35] this is who you are this is the man that
[1:46:38] God loved he said I love Jacob we saw it
[1:46:41] on Sunday it was not this Jacob
[1:46:43] there was another Jacob that God loved
[1:46:46] amen they picture God have for you in
[1:46:49] heaven is not this picture
[1:46:52] because some of you went into the world
[1:46:54] and you came up with a tattoo is God
[1:46:57] going to have a tattoo on your picture
[1:46:58] if you repent the tattoo will be still
[1:47:01] on your body but your glorified body
[1:47:03] doesn't have tattoo and brother Branham
[1:47:05] said the picture God took of you was the
[1:47:07] picture before the foundation of the
[1:47:09] world I have the court
[1:47:11] that is your true ID
[1:47:15] that's your identification that is who
[1:47:18] you are and it's individual
[1:47:21] let's remember who we are
[1:47:23] before you react remember who you are
[1:47:26] before you go somewhere remember who you
[1:47:29] are before you post something remember
[1:47:32] who you are
[1:47:34] and I'm gonna say this children of God
[1:47:36] are not stupid
[1:47:38] there is a level of discernment in the
[1:47:40] brother
[1:47:41] we can look at your picture and we see
[1:47:44] what you're trying to say without you
[1:47:46] saying anything I have looked at paper
[1:47:48] paper like this
[1:47:50] and I say this is what the person is
[1:47:52] asking and somebody who was there argue
[1:47:54] with me they say no that's not it I said
[1:47:57] this is what they're saying they didn't
[1:47:58] put it on the paper they say no I say
[1:48:01] call the person they ask the person that
[1:48:02] he was exactly right if I would have
[1:48:05] went with what they written here I would
[1:48:07] have missed that what is the identity
[1:48:09] we're showing to the children what is
[1:48:11] the identity we're given in our work
[1:48:13] what is the identity we are Christian
[1:48:16] your identity is personal God is calling
[1:48:20] you for that personal work if every
[1:48:23] young people in the message don't want
[1:48:24] to work with God you walk with God if
[1:48:27] nobody in this church want to follow God
[1:48:29] you follow God because by the end of the
[1:48:32] day somebody will stay here and someone
[1:48:35] else will go into the Rapture they read
[1:48:38] the scripture here when they say there
[1:48:39] were two in the field one was taken the
[1:48:42] other one was left don't be among those
[1:48:45] that are left be among that Rapture
[1:48:48] brand that will be taken to meet the
[1:48:50] Lord into the air let's pray Heavenly
[1:48:52] Father
[1:48:53] Lord we are approaching you humbly again
[1:48:56] tonight father once again thanking you
[1:48:59] for your grace for your love for your
[1:49:02] mercy father and for everything you have
[1:49:04] been doing for us
[1:49:06] father you brought your servant
[1:49:08] tonight Lord to deliver the very thought
[1:49:11] that you put in his heart Lord
[1:49:15] and father by him touching the two
[1:49:18] aspect of perfection he didn't even know
[1:49:22] what was laying in the slide that have
[1:49:26] not been even untouched but I understood
[1:49:29] the signal that you gave me but what I'm
[1:49:32] praying is I'm pleading
[1:49:35] so that Lord father each member of this
[1:49:38] church
[1:49:39] and even those that will be streaming
[1:49:41] later and worldwide may we wake up
[1:49:44] to realize Who We Are
[1:49:47] father it was a long time ago that we
[1:49:50] saw crazy haircut into the world
[1:49:54] it didn't take loot too long those
[1:49:56] haircuts got into the denomination and
[1:50:00] today what we are witnessing is young
[1:50:03] people in the message
[1:50:05] cutting the haircut exactly like that
[1:50:08] but still the people are still joking
[1:50:12] the people are still playing the people
[1:50:15] are still doing what they want
[1:50:16] regardless of how much you're pulling
[1:50:19] because Lord father spiritual Amnesia
[1:50:22] have struck and the people have
[1:50:25] not remembering who they are but father
[1:50:28] I pray
[1:50:29] in the name of Jesus Christ that you
[1:50:33] break that spiritual nature father May
[1:50:36] the mercies of God
[1:50:37] be once again pour down upon this church
[1:50:40] that you break every complex every
[1:50:44] Spirit of stubbornness
[1:50:46] that is protecting and creating a shell
[1:50:50] that no matter how much the world is
[1:50:53] coming is hitting a dead wall
[1:50:58] father you the one that brought the
[1:51:00] walls
[1:51:02] of Jericho down
[1:51:04] father all I see behind is people that
[1:51:07] are enclosed in prison that think that
[1:51:10] they are right
[1:51:12] they have a high opinion of themselves
[1:51:16] and they don't want to Humble themselves
[1:51:19] before the word of God
[1:51:21] and the greatest curse that I can see
[1:51:24] father is somebody who thinks that they
[1:51:27] are right when they are wrong
[1:51:29] father may you break that from the
[1:51:32] people
[1:51:32] and may you lose them completely out
[1:51:35] made the realize that whatever
[1:51:38] accomplishment we can do in this world
[1:51:40] it will stay
[1:51:42] and all of them will be volcanic ashes
[1:51:45] may we understand what was spoken
[1:51:47] tonight to seek ye first the kingdom of
[1:51:50] God
[1:51:51] so that the other things will be
[1:51:54] following us but not us putting the
[1:51:56] court before the way Lord
[1:51:58] father I pray that you strengthened
[1:52:00] brother Aaron father remember him and
[1:52:03] his family
[1:52:04] father this is a very tough time that we
[1:52:07] are selling but we know that you built
[1:52:09] us for this hour that's why we have
[1:52:11] courage and we are continuing to press
[1:52:14] on but we need Lord a patch from you so
[1:52:18] that we can stay on that Firing Line
[1:52:20] Lord
[1:52:21] father remember spoken word Tabernacle
[1:52:23] remember every family that is part of
[1:52:26] this church and even those that have
[1:52:28] been subscribed Lord and become a family
[1:52:30] all over the world Lord father that you
[1:52:33] touch them that this message don't go
[1:52:35] and Loud fathers sit in their intellect
[1:52:38] but there's the soak down
[1:52:40] deep in their soul so that somebody will
[1:52:44] be set free and found who they are
[1:52:48] and be able to be reconciled with their
[1:52:51] family like you did to the man that was
[1:52:54] possessed by religion
[1:52:59] father continue to consecrate your
[1:53:02] children
[1:53:08] Lord I pray that you move that pressure
[1:53:14] that is pressurizing the things of God
[1:53:17] until
[1:53:19] we can do anything
[1:53:22] we can program
[1:53:25] event for five hours
[1:53:27] for six hours
[1:53:29] but when it comes to reading the
[1:53:31] scripture
[1:53:32] at home
[1:53:33] we want to do it quick
[1:53:36] we want to pray quick
[1:53:39] we want to preach quick
[1:53:41] we want to go home quick
[1:53:44] but when we reach home
[1:53:47] and look at what we are accomplishing
[1:53:50] we spend more time on our phone
[1:53:52] more time on conversations
[1:53:55] more time talking on the phone being on
[1:53:58] the computer entertaining one another
[1:54:01] versus Lord father
[1:54:04] investing for a spiritual walk and for
[1:54:07] the Inside Man
[1:54:08] father you spoke through your Prophet
[1:54:10] that the Holy Spirit Lord
[1:54:13] feeds upon the word
[1:54:15] father I don't know how much I can
[1:54:17] emphasize
[1:54:19] because the power of a religious spirit
[1:54:21] have soothing into this message
[1:54:24] have heard so many lives
[1:54:27] and put them into a comfort zone
[1:54:30] that they think because they just part
[1:54:32] of this message they will be raptured
[1:54:37] there is no more pressing
[1:54:40] there is no more interest to the things
[1:54:42] of God
[1:54:44] if we cross our mind wrong we won't do
[1:54:46] it anymore
[1:54:49] who are we father
[1:54:51] what do we have that we have not
[1:54:54] received from thee
[1:54:56] you can call anybody home tonight
[1:54:59] and their life will be finished
[1:55:02] and whatever project they have for
[1:55:04] tomorrow is stop right there
[1:55:08] father work each one of us
[1:55:10] remove all this foolishness from our
[1:55:12] life
[1:55:13] prone to everything that needs to be
[1:55:15] prone of Our Lives
[1:55:18] remove this demonic pressure
[1:55:27] that have clogged up our schedule
[1:55:31] we are so busy
[1:55:32] accomplishing nothing
[1:55:36] and by the end of the day
[1:55:38] our spiritual Wonder our body are tired
[1:55:41] and tomorrow we wake up again to go back
[1:55:44] on the same race
[1:55:46] father pull us aside
[1:55:50] Lord let each one here
[1:55:53] each person that will be listening to
[1:55:56] this may we go home and Ponder
[1:55:59] may we sit down and meditate
[1:56:02] where are we
[1:56:03] what are we reflecting

[1:56:09] what are we trying to accomplish
[1:56:11] which identity
[1:56:13] do we have
[1:56:16] what are we working for
[1:56:18] what are we trying to achieve with what
[1:56:20] we're doing
[1:56:25] help us out father
[1:56:29] hurts when the things of God are dump
[1:56:34] because of pleasure
[1:56:36] it hurt when the spiritual things are
[1:56:38] neglected
[1:56:42] because something of a belly
[1:56:44] spirituality
[1:56:45] pleasure
[1:56:47] have taken more than the praise of God
[1:56:50] and the people who tried to press on
[1:56:52] have been ridiculed by the people in the
[1:56:55] message
[1:56:59] but father
[1:57:01] you encourage us tonight to walk alone
[1:57:05] to move on because at the end
