[19:40] I don't believe we have
[19:43] any praise report and prayer request
[19:46] amen
[19:47] amen
[19:49] but I I have a special to my email
[19:55] especially that was requested by brother
[19:58] Mike remained
[20:00] and um
[20:03] but but before then I would ask Brother
[20:06] Sam if you can come up a man to bring
[20:09] before the Lord
[20:12] any unspoken request
[20:25] Amazon excited
[20:27] oh my I can't hardly wait for these
[20:30] times to get here
[20:31] and I do have a
[20:34] praise report
[20:37] I've been praying for a little far
[20:38] because driving back and forth in the
[20:41] price of gas we could hardly afford it
[20:44] and the price of cars are like
[20:47] a roof and we don't like car payments
[20:51] we just don't like them I mean if we
[20:53] have to pay them we pay them but we
[20:54] don't like them
[20:55] I recommend that you don't get involved
[20:57] in them
[20:59] if you possibly can
[21:02] the Lord provided us a small card
[21:04] exactly what we needed good gas mileage
[21:07] and we paid cash
[21:11] and it wasn't a crazy price
[21:16] and if if I had time I'd tell you all
[21:18] the circumstances but it was just
[21:19] amazing the way it all just worked out
[21:22] very grateful to the Lord I'm so
[21:24] thankful for the word Lord that you've
[21:26] been sharing with us Lord it just
[21:28] illuminates our life it puts a skip in
[21:30] her step a smile on our face Lord to
[21:33] know that you love us enough father that
[21:35] you would come down in this end time
[21:38] and you would fulfill your word Lord and
[21:40] send us teachers and pastors and and
[21:43] apostles and all everything that we need
[21:46] Lord for the perfecting of the Saints
[21:48] for the work of the ministry until we
[21:52] all come in the unity of the faith and
[21:57] we're here tonight Lord because we know
[21:58] that faith comes by hearing hearing by
[22:01] the word how can we hear without a
[22:03] preacher and how can he preach except
[22:05] they be sin so we pray that you'll
[22:07] anoint the speaker tonight we pray that
[22:10] you'll anoint our ears that we can hear
[22:14] that our faith can be built up Lord
[22:18] Jesus Oh father and that our
[22:21] relationship to you will become stronger
[22:23] and stronger that our house will will uh
[22:27] will will will
[22:30] what am I thinking that that we will
[22:32] become less and that you'll become more

[22:36] pray father for the for the victims down
[22:39] there of this hurricane coming up the
[22:41] coming up the coast Lord Jesus I I heard
[22:45] a report that there's many even now

[22:53] that you can walk on water you can still
[22:56] walk through the storms there's nothing
[22:58] too difficult for you as long as you're
[23:00] in the boat we're okay so be with these
[23:03] are our our friends down there Lord any
[23:07] that are in the Faith Lord let your
[23:09] angels be about them keep them perfectly

[31:31] the blood
[31:34] no Fellowship you cannot approach god

[31:43] life until you can stand in front of
[31:46] God's spotless
[31:48] like you've never done anything to begin
[31:50] with how can you imagine that only the
[31:54] blood of Jesus Christ can do it amen
[31:56] amen glory to God I know why I'm saying

[32:23] the anointing is already
[32:25] amen I need to get out of here quick
[32:27] amen
[32:30] my God Brother David is this the new
[32:33] suffering
[32:34] it looks great with that background it's
[32:37] like we're soaring in eternity amen amen
[32:40] I love the background it looks pretty
[32:42] good amen all righty blessed be the name
[32:47] of the Lord I hope those that have not
[32:49] done the reading
[32:50] that you're catching up on the reading
[32:52] God was merciful to you on Sunday he
[32:56] held me 25 miles an hour so somebody can
[33:00] catch up so remember it's the mercy of
[33:02] God if you have not read go ahead and
[33:04] read it again amen if you read or you
[33:07] read it after you can go back to
[33:09] Revelation 17 Revelation 13 Revelation
[33:12] 12 with the sermon you'll see everything
[33:14] coming up clear there is even more stuff
[33:17] than that that are hidden there amen
[33:19] amen but because it's a compound the the
[33:23] scripture have a compound meaning amen
[33:27] that's why the Bible say the seven heads
[33:29] are seven Kings
[33:31] and the Bible says the seven heads are
[33:34] Seven Hills
[33:36] you see that amen
[33:38] do you know that amen amen it's written
[33:40] in Revelation 17. if you look you would
[33:43] say say the beasts have seven somebody's
[33:45] looking up in your Bible I don't want
[33:46] you to say brother Stephen say
[33:49] I see somebody lost
[33:51] open your Bible please I don't want you
[33:53] to say brother Stephen say
[33:55] amen
[33:58] Oh Glory to God
[34:02] amen amen
[34:05] Hallelujah
[34:07] revelation 17.
[34:14] today
[34:15] verse 9.
[34:22] everything we went through you should be
[34:24] in love with your Bible
[34:27] every car I drive has a Bible
[34:30] every car I drive I purchase bubble I
[34:33] put it there when I stopped somewhere I
[34:34] can just poop and I'm reading my Bible
[34:38] it's the message of the hour that made
[34:40] me love the Bible like that
[34:42] amen amen amen amen
[34:47] first man and here is the mind
[34:50] which has wisdom and we know wisdom
[34:53] comes from the second oil
[34:55] amen only those that have the second oil
[34:58] will have this mind and the wisdom of
[35:01] God Paul told us that it was Christ
[35:04] so the mind I have wisdom it means the
[35:07] mind of Christ
[35:09] amen makes sense because Christ is the
[35:13] wisdom of God
[35:14] so the mind I have wisdom is the mind of
[35:17] Christ let the mind this mind be in you
[35:20] the mind of Christ being you if you have
[35:22] the mind of Christ then you're going to
[35:24] understand the things of God verse 9 he
[35:26] say and here is the mind which has
[35:29] wisdom the seven heads are seven water
[35:34] mountains on which the woman seated the
[35:37] first stand and there are seven what
[35:39] so you see why brother Branham keeps
[35:42] saying every scripture you have a
[35:43] compound meaning
[35:44] so you can take seven mountain and you
[35:47] can change again and take seven Kings
[35:50] but we went with the mountain we never
[35:52] went with the Kings so there is more to
[35:55] it go home and read and read and read
[35:58] the Holy Spirit Will unfold more and
[36:01] more amen
[36:02] amen so if you're behind go ahead and do
[36:05] it because Lord's willing on Sunday
[36:07] we're back on the military airplane
[36:10] okay I don't know how long we're going
[36:13] to stay in this airplane so
[36:15] stay alert amen
[36:17] good to see buddy John back in the
[36:19] family on October 1st which was this
[36:22] Saturday we canceled the family days
[36:25] because of the
[36:27] the rain that we will be having based on
[36:29] what's going on in Florida and remember
[36:31] the scent in Florida so that the Lord
[36:33] will protect them but the same mouths
[36:35] already pray about it but just keep them
[36:37] in mind knowing that somebody up there
[36:39] is probably going through a rough way
[36:41] there amen so on the weekend we can be
[36:44] outside because of the rain amen so that
[36:47] gives you some extra time to spend time
[36:50] in prayer and read and catch up on what
[36:52] you got to catch up amen
[36:54] glory to God tonight brother Solomon
[36:57] Huffman who will be preaching

[37:23] a clap of him glory to God
[37:26] amen
[37:28] everything will be all right all the
[37:31] shaking going on is just a Deliverance
[37:33] [Music]
[37:34] amen we don't like your life a life of
[37:38] pretense is a hard life to live
[37:41] you gotta work all the time to keep that
[37:45] image up
[37:46] it's not natural but the natural life
[37:49] you just leave it you don't tell a lamb
[37:53] but how to manufacture wool
[37:55] he just walk eat dance jump run and
[37:59] before you know it will keep coming out
[38:01] he doesn't even know how well coming up
[38:04] because he doesn't have anything to do
[38:06] with all but if you're not a lamb whole
[38:09] body every morning you gotta wake up and
[38:11] then you gotta get some glue
[38:14] amen you will have a hairpiece every
[38:17] morning you gotta work on it I didn't
[38:19] want to go that route I know the devil
[38:21] will try to put somebody there no
[38:23] problem with that but I'm just saying
[38:25] that if you don't have it you're gonna
[38:28] suffer all along because you're trying
[38:30] to put up an image
[38:32] you don't want to do that
[38:34] if you do that your Christian life is
[38:36] hard it is heavy it is discouraging it
[38:41] is troublesome and it's always keep you
[38:44] alert upset like what am I doing that is
[38:48] wrong no when the plans you beneath the
[38:51] flood
[38:52] [Music]
[38:54] of that Crimson blood
[38:56] that say
[38:58] amen amen you just leave the way God
[39:01] created you to be
[39:03] amen God knows who you are amen you
[39:07] don't have to put up for nothing
[39:09] it's a lot of work
[39:12] it's a lot of work and a whole lot of
[39:15] work because every morning you gotta
[39:16] remember everything that you already
[39:18] created in your life and say it's like
[39:20] an engine they have to check in every
[39:22] every morning before you crack the
[39:24] engine you got to go to one two three
[39:25] four five six and you put it up because
[39:27] if you miss something you're gonna leak
[39:29] out
[39:30] your true identity to the public
[39:34] why suffering like that what I'm doing
[39:37] at home is what I'm doing outside that's
[39:39] why I brought the brand I'm saying
[39:40] preach on the pulpit the way you talk on
[39:43] the street
[39:45] that's what brother I'm saying you don't
[39:47] get on the pulpit and start you know
[39:49] pretty much you're wasting your time
[39:53] you're wasting your time it's gonna show
[39:55] up one day because if somebody's seeing
[39:57] you on the street they'll be like wait a
[39:59] minute is this the same preacher that is
[40:00] there then you give him confusion but if
[40:03] you talk the way you talk on the street
[40:05] the way you talk to your people
[40:07] everything will be fun they can even
[40:09] recognize you they say who's there
[40:10] that's brother Stephen talking there I
[40:12] can tell it's him up there praise God
[40:16] easy
[40:18] you got part 0 point something amen

[42:31] I tell you we
[42:33] 've been on church services hundreds and
[42:36] thousands of times

[45:45] first chapter I mean I'd like to say
[45:47] it's certainly an honor and privilege to

[45:51] enjoyed the last time being here amen

[45:56] kind of the honor to be with you here

[46:02] that's here but most of all we're glad

[46:06] have my wife here with me she's a
[46:08] warrior and a trooper she does a lot of
[46:11] my driving so just pray that God will
[46:13] bless her especially tonight but just a
[46:16] couple of things here that God's laid on
[46:18] our hearts and I found it a good thing
[46:21] to just obey the Lord and so that's what
[46:23] we'll do tonight and here in the Book of
[46:26] Luke in the first chapter
[46:27] we'll begin reading in the 26th verse
[46:29] where we down to the 38th the Bible
[46:32] would read this and in the sixth month
[46:34] the angel Gabriel was sent from God unto
[46:37] a city of Galilee named Nazareth to a
[46:39] virgin a spouse to a man whose name was
[46:41] Joseph of the House of David and the
[46:44] virgin's name was Mary
[46:46] and the angel came
[46:48] in unto her and said hell thou that are
[46:52] highly favored the Lord is with thee and
[46:55] blessed art thou among women when she
[46:58] saw him she was troubled at his sayings
[47:00] and casting her mind what manner of
[47:03] salutation this should be and the angel
[47:06] said unto her fear not Mary for thou has
[47:09] found favor with God Amen could you
[47:11] imagine an angel telling you that for
[47:14] thou has found favor with God and behold
[47:16] Thou shalt conceive in thy womb and
[47:19] bring forth a son
[47:21] and shall call his name Jesus and he
[47:23] shall be great and shall be called the
[47:26] son of the highest
[47:27] and the Lord God shall give unto him the
[47:30] Throne of his father David
[47:32] and he shall reign over the house of
[47:34] Jacob forever and of his kingdom there
[47:36] shall be no wind and then send Mary unto
[47:39] the angel how shall this be
[47:42] amen now this scripture here she's not
[47:44] so much as questioning what the angel is
[47:47] telling her but she's questioning how is
[47:50] this going to happen how is this
[47:51] impossible thing how is this going to
[47:54] take place
[47:55] saying I know not a man the angel
[47:58] answered and said unto her the Holy
[47:59] Ghost shall come upon thee and the power
[48:02] of the highest shall overshadow thee and
[48:04] therefore also that Holy thing which
[48:06] shall be born of thee shall be called
[48:09] The Son of God and behold thy cousin
[48:12] Elizabeth she hath also conceived a son
[48:14] in her old age and this is the sixth
[48:17] month with her who was called Baron
[48:19] notice this is still the angel
[48:21] continuing on with this message of her
[48:23] for with God nothing shall be impossible
[48:27] amen now this would be the reason that
[48:30] the angel Gabriel would be sent from God
[48:32] unto Mary instead of all the other women
[48:36] and Mary said behold the handmaid of the
[48:38] Lord be it unto me according to Thy word
[48:42] and the angel departed from her we ask
[48:45] that God will bless his word as you can
[48:47] be seated and just for a couple minutes
[48:49] of time tonight we don't plan to hold
[48:51] you long being a midweek service amen
[48:53] but I want to speak to you by the help
[48:54] of God tonight on the subject of resting
[48:57] in the strength of the word
[48:59] amen resting in the strength of the word
[49:02] and I found in my life that the word of
[49:05] God it's a word like none other amen
[49:07] God's word it's nothing like the word of
[49:10] a man amen by God's word has power to
[49:12] change lives God's word has power to
[49:15] deliver God's word has power to do the
[49:17] impossible amen God's word has such a
[49:20] creative power behind it amen that
[49:23] whenever God has done anything God has
[49:25] used the strength of his own word amen
[49:28] God has used the power of His word amen
[49:31] you'll find any time God will go to do
[49:33] something God uses his word when he
[49:35] wanted when he wanted to create this
[49:37] Earth what he used he used his word amen
[49:40] when he wanted to create human amen
[49:42] humankind what did he do he used the
[49:44] power of His word
[49:46] amen so we can say tonight amen that
[49:49] God's word it's a powerful word and
[49:51] there's a strength behind that word amen
[49:54] and just to build a little foundation in
[49:56] this tonight by the help of God I I want
[49:58] you to notice as the angel would have a
[50:00] message
[50:01] amen and come to Mary amen now this
[50:04] message was not the message of Gabriel
[50:06] the Angel but this message was a message
[50:09] from God that He gave unto the angel
[50:11] Gabriel and he sent Gabriel down to Mary
[50:14] so in other words we could say this way
[50:16] this was God's message unto Mary amen
[50:20] this was not Gabriel's message but this
[50:22] was God's message as he would come down
[50:25] to Mary now now it's very amazing in
[50:27] this because I want you to notice amen
[50:30] how impossible this word that God gave
[50:33] Mary to amen that God gave Mary to keep
[50:35] in other words we could say that way
[50:37] amen God came unto Mary and said behold
[50:40] or the angel came to Mary rather and
[50:43] said Yemen you're a virgin you're going
[50:45] to conceive and you're going to Bear a
[50:47] sign and you're going to call his name
[50:48] Jesus now I don't know about you but
[50:51] being a virgin amen that seems like a
[50:53] very impossible word amen how is this
[50:56] going to happen seeing I don't know a
[50:58] man amen and this Angel gives Mary such
[51:01] a amen such an impossible word by saying
[51:05] you shall bear a sign amen and yet
[51:07] remain a virgin while you bear the sign
[51:09] Amen to no doubt in the Heart of Mary
[51:12] she's got all of these questions
[51:13] thinking how in the world can this be
[51:16] how is this going to be possible but I
[51:19] want you to notice the word of God God
[51:21] makes his word so impossible for us to
[51:25] be able to do it he makes it so
[51:27] impossible for us to be able to keep it
[51:30] amen and you say what brother son why
[51:32] does God do it that way amen because God
[51:34] wants to keep his word through your life
[51:38] amen God's not looking for you to do it
[51:41] that's why God came to Mary and gave her
[51:44] such an impossible word because he
[51:47] didn't want Mary to manufacture the life
[51:49] he didn't want Mary to put on the life
[51:52] but God said I want to put the life in
[51:55] you amen I'm gonna bring to life you're
[51:58] not going to have to manufacture it
[52:00] you're not going to have to produce but
[52:02] amen the Holy Ghost will overshadow you
[52:05] I'll be the one doing it I'll be the one
[52:08] doing the word
[52:10] Hallelujah amen I want you to notice God
[52:13] was not interested in Mary's ability God
[52:17] was not interested in Mary's strengths
[52:19] God was not interested in marriage amen
[52:22] her physical ability to do anything God
[52:25] bypassed all of her ability because he
[52:29] knew she could not do it
[52:31] Hallelujah I said he knew she could not
[52:34] do it so I said I I don't want your
[52:37] strength Mary I don't want your ability
[52:39] Mary I don't want what you got to offer
[52:42] all I wanted your heart
[52:45] I want your heart Mary I want your
[52:48] surrenderance Mary and she said be it
[52:50] unto me
[52:52] according to your word and I want to
[52:55] tell you tonight God ain't looking for
[52:56] your ability God ain't looking for your
[52:59] strength God ain't looking for what you
[53:01] got to offer amen God wants to keep his
[53:04] word through your life by the power of
[53:07] the Holy Ghost
[53:10] Hallelujah
[53:13] why would God ask me to do something so
[53:16] impossible
[53:19] why would God do that
[53:21] amen the most impossible situation the
[53:25] most impossible thing a human I mean
[53:28] it's so far out impossible amen Behold a
[53:32] virgin shall conceive amen so impossible
[53:35] I mean how could it happen how could it
[53:38] be and this is how God works he makes
[53:41] his word so impossible for a man to do
[53:45] that the only hope we got is to get the
[53:49] Holy Ghost the only holy God is to have
[53:53] the life of God overshadow us and live
[53:57] in our lives
[53:59] Hallelujah
[54:02] I know why would God give us a word and
[54:04] a commandment so perfect and I don't
[54:07] know about you but have you have you
[54:08] ever studied the law amen Leviticus and
[54:11] all the laws throughout the Bible amen
[54:13] that seems like such an impossible thing
[54:17] ain't such an impossible word God was
[54:20] proving all the time you abilities
[54:23] aren't going to get you nowhere your
[54:26] abilities aren't going to save you your
[54:29] abilities are not going to keep you amen
[54:31] can I just preach you for a moment might
[54:33] as well amen God Amen is not dependent
[54:37] on my ability amen God is not dependent
[54:40] on my ability he said what's God
[54:42] dependent on brother he's depending on
[54:45] the strengths
[54:47] he's depending on the strength of his
[54:51] word amen Isaiah the prophet prophesied
[54:54] he said behold a virgin shall conceive
[54:57] amen and that was God's word circling
[55:01] the earth you could not stop that oh God
[55:04] I said you could not stop that word
[55:07] because God said so but amen the Virgin
[55:11] Mary could not help but bear a son whose
[55:15] name amen Amen brother amen her greatest
[55:17] failures couldn't stop it her greatest
[55:20] problems couldn't stop it the church
[55:23] trouble couldn't stop it the family
[55:25] trouble couldn't stop it the critics
[55:27] couldn't stop it
[55:29] amen there was not a power that was able
[55:33] to stop it because God said so God said
[55:37] that a virgin is going to conceive God's
[55:40] hand there's got to be a bride
[55:43] there's gonna be an overcomer there's
[55:46] gonna be a bride this is God's word God
[55:51] said so it's Unstoppable
[55:57] the devil said it ain't gonna happen but
[56:00] God said so
[56:02] the devil said I I'll tell you what I
[56:05] don't know about Mary
[56:07] Mary's Mary's got this problem Mary's
[56:10] got this problem and Mary's got this
[56:13] issue Mary's got this sin but what do
[56:16] the Angels say
[56:18] Mary you're highly favored
[56:23] you're highly favored
[56:25] among all the women was there better
[56:29] women than Mary share their world with
[56:32] some better women than Mary shall they
[56:34] were but God didn't favor all the other
[56:37] women
[56:38] God's favorite Mary
[56:41] I say bastard are you bride God is
[56:45] favored the bride of Christ your
[56:48] favorite among the church World your
[56:50] favorite among the denomination God has
[56:53] favored the bride
[56:58] [Music]
[57:01] he said why did he favor us because he
[57:05] wanted to
[57:07] why did he pay for Mary because he
[57:10] wanted to why did he favor you brother
[57:12] because he wanted to
[57:15] is it because you're better it's not
[57:18] because you're better is it because
[57:19] you're greater it's not because you're
[57:22] greater it's because God
[57:25] predestinated you by far knowledge he
[57:29] knew what you would say being under me
[57:32] according to your word
[57:35] and you're highly favored of God
[57:42] Hallelujah

[57:56] salutation that's how you take

[58:14] favored you're highly favored of God

[58:59] thinks about you I don't care what your

[1:11:12] master if we expect to fulfill God's
[1:11:16] desire in our life he said we have to
[1:11:20] master the thought of human ability
[1:11:25] aim of the human ability and this is why
[1:11:28] we get so defeated sometimes because
[1:11:31] when this human ability does not hold up
[1:11:34] we say well my God I guess I'm not bride
[1:11:36] I guess I'm not this and I guess I'm not
[1:11:38] this I'm not are you amazed that human

[1:12:01] always failed and it always will
[1:12:04] foreign
[1:12:05] teaches us we must Master the thought of
[1:12:08] human ability and if we ever get to a
[1:12:11] spot
[1:12:12] where we sang that we can do it with our
[1:12:16] own intelligence and our own abilities
[1:12:20] he says we've got to master it in such a
[1:12:22] way to where we get rid of that thing
[1:12:25] and then lay it aside so God can use us
[1:12:30] that's right
[1:12:33] I used to speaking to somebody tonight
[1:12:35] amen when we can get that human ability
[1:12:38] and lay it aside and say God I know that
[1:12:43] it's human ability is not going to get
[1:12:46] me in I know that this human ability I'm
[1:12:49] not gonna make it and by the way I'm
[1:12:51] saying master that thought of laying
[1:12:54] human ability to the side and then
[1:12:58] surrender unto God
[1:13:01] I mean he says why make a complete and
[1:13:03] total surrender he says we cannot use
[1:13:06] one ability we got to make a complete
[1:13:09] surrender and come to God and surrender
[1:13:12] both soul body and spirit everything
[1:13:15] we've got has to be surrendered to God
[1:13:18] in order for amen for him to be able to
[1:13:22] work his will in you and me
[1:13:24] I mean how important that is I say God
[1:13:28] tonight help me master the thought of my
[1:13:30] own ability help me master the thought
[1:13:34] of my own strengths help me master I'm
[1:13:37] at the thought of my knowledge the
[1:13:39] thought of what I can do and what I can
[1:13:41] offer I mean God help me master that

[1:24:37] I remember the realm continues on and
[1:24:38] speaking about it amen she said you know
[1:24:41] I'm going to have a baby before she felt
[1:24:43] anything it's because the word had
[1:24:46] already been set there so notice before
[1:24:49] any and before any feeling
[1:24:52] before any emotion before anything she
[1:24:57] didn't need any of that the word was
[1:25:00] spoken
[1:25:02] amen the word was spoken amen of Virgin
[1:25:06] shall conceive and as I said there'll be
[1:25:09] nothing that can stop that word amen
[1:25:12] that Angel's message
[1:25:14] the Angel's message that came under her
[1:25:17] and gave her those words sent from God
[1:25:20] but nothing could stop it
[1:25:24] and I want to say this God has sent an
[1:25:28] angel in the age you and I live in amen
[1:25:31] and he rung up the words there will be a
[1:25:35] bride
[1:25:36] amen there will be a bride
[1:25:40] ask her the question
[1:25:42] amen the same God that spoke to Gabriel
[1:25:45] it's the same God I spoke to William
[1:25:48] Branham it's the same word
[1:25:52] it's an Unstoppable word it's an
[1:25:56] Unstoppable Force
[1:25:58] I want you to realize something just for
[1:26:00] a moment the Reason God Amen has put his
[1:26:04] word behind you is because God is
[1:26:07] determined to have a bride
[1:26:11] is that right the Reason God is using
[1:26:14] the power of His word is because God is
[1:26:17] determined to have a bride
[1:26:19] he said what do you mean God's word is
[1:26:22] Unstoppable
[1:26:24] amen as the women as the prophecy of
[1:26:27] Isaiah was spoken Amen in a time and
[1:26:30] circle the world
[1:26:32] foreign
[1:26:36] until it found the vessel that was
[1:26:39] ordained to that word amen that word got
[1:26:42] behind Mary amen and it caused her to
[1:26:47] produce a son it was the word of God
[1:26:50] item that caused her to produce a little
[1:26:54] life of Jesus Christ and God has sent
[1:26:58] the message and the age you and I live
[1:27:00] in and the creative power is behind the
[1:27:05] world and the word is behind you
[1:27:08] [Music]
[1:27:09] I feel like shouting here for a minute
[1:27:12] amen you're supposed to I can't do it
[1:27:16] luckily you can't because God's word is
[1:27:20] behind you
[1:27:21] you say oh my God I just I just can't do
[1:27:25] it you see you cannot stop prophecy
[1:27:29] is that correct you can't stop prophecy
[1:27:31] right failures won't stop prophecy
[1:27:34] issues won't stop prophecy nothing could
[1:27:38] stop prophecy so when God prophesies
[1:27:42] our sermon God prophesies there is going
[1:27:46] to be an overcomer
[1:27:48] there's gonna be a bride Damon Rapture
[1:27:52] not allowed to see ya when God
[1:27:55] prophesies it there is nothing that can
[1:27:57] stop that from happening
[1:28:02] Hallelujah
[1:28:03] I'm going to illustrate just for a
[1:28:05] moment
[1:28:09] here's a believer
[1:28:11] now it's prophesied that this chair is
[1:28:16] going to make it all the way across the
[1:28:17] side of this room Solomon Huffman has
[1:28:20] given a prophecy this chair is going to
[1:28:23] make it all the way over there
[1:28:26] foreign
[1:28:27] ER than this chair I'm a lot greater
[1:28:31] than this chair compared to me this
[1:28:33] chair is nothing it's got no strength
[1:28:36] it's got no ability it's got nothing
[1:28:39] that can offer it's got no good works
[1:28:42] it's got no strength in it it's got no
[1:28:45] life in it so the life of Solomon
[1:28:47] Huffman Gets behind the chair
[1:28:52] Hallelujah It Gets behind the chair
[1:28:56] and the prophecy is fulfilled and God
[1:29:00] and God is behind the bride brother
[1:29:03] God's behind the bride
[1:29:05] [Music]
[1:29:08] shanas through every battle through
[1:29:11] every trial
[1:29:14] through every chest
[1:29:17] through every problem God's pushing us
[1:29:21] he said why is he pushing us to all the
[1:29:24] way back home
[1:29:26] oh
[1:29:28] wow
[1:29:32] Hallelujah why don't you question us to
[1:29:35] all the way back home
[1:29:38] can I ask you a question amen whose
[1:29:41] strength is greater gods are yours
[1:29:45] whose abilities greater gods are yours
[1:29:48] God's his amen so the next time you say
[1:29:51] God can't do it you just remember and
[1:29:54] Solomon can push a chair that God is
[1:29:57] surely strong enough aiming to push me
[1:30:00] God is strong enough to keep me
[1:30:06] Hallelujah
[1:30:10] musicians come
[1:30:18] take that devil
[1:30:20] take that devil
[1:30:23] take that devil
[1:30:25] the devil wants to point out my flaws
[1:30:27] and your flaws I say devil take this
[1:30:30] God said this about me
[1:30:33] Amen brother Branham talked about Mary
[1:30:35] there he said the devil came to Mary and
[1:30:37] said all that can't happen
[1:30:39] that's not gonna happen Mary Amen
[1:30:42] brother mom said she just shook that
[1:30:44] away from her and she rested in the word
[1:30:48] she rested in the strength of the word
[1:30:52] I stand to our feet
[1:31:02] so the next time you think you can't
[1:31:06] the next time you think you can't do it
[1:31:10] I want you to remember God's power
[1:31:13] and remember God's word
[1:31:15] God said you can
[1:31:18] I'm a lesson your word ain't on the
[1:31:20] stake
[1:31:21] your ability is not on the stake
[1:31:24] this is God's word
[1:31:25] [Applause]
[1:31:27] I I want this anger in your heart God
[1:31:29] does not need your strength to keep his
[1:31:31] word
[1:31:32] amen amen amen Sarah in the Bible
[1:31:35] thought God needed her strengths
[1:31:38] Sarah said God needed her help
[1:31:42] I need to help God keep his promise
[1:31:46] so Sarah said Abraham take Hagar and you
[1:31:49] have the child but God said that's not
[1:31:51] what I said I said through Sarah
[1:31:54] through that womb
[1:31:57] through thy womb I'm gonna give you a
[1:32:00] child amen some alignments sometimes we
[1:32:03] down we say well I'll tell you what this
[1:32:05] message is for somebody else it ain't
[1:32:07] for me God said through that womb
[1:32:11] God says through you I'll tell you why
[1:32:14] somebody else is going to make the
[1:32:15] Rapture I don't know about me God says
[1:32:17] you would
[1:32:19] amen God said the bridewood amen not
[1:32:22] another but you will
[1:32:25] Hallelujah

[1:42:14] it went exactly where m is did you
[1:42:17] notice that in Abraham
[1:42:19] did you notice that in heaven
[1:42:23] amen right alongside
[1:42:30] glory to God
[1:42:38] you see that
[1:42:53] ham were hooked to the m
[1:42:57] that's the only part that God was
[1:43:00] looking for
[1:43:01] in Abraham
[1:43:03] amen
[1:43:06] amen you focusing on this
[1:43:08] four
[1:43:11] which is the number of the Earth
[1:43:14] and this is God
[1:43:17] in human flesh
[1:43:26] right God in human flesh you're focusing
[1:43:32] about these four
[1:43:33] this is what you see all the time
[1:43:35] amen he's not looking at that he's
[1:43:38] looking at number 13.
[1:43:41] and he's a circle himself because this
[1:43:43] is one and eight it's a circle it's
[1:43:46] eternity he brings that eternal life and
[1:43:49] who could where the Emmys and that's it
[1:43:54] amen amen amen let's see that in the
[1:43:56] scripture Ephesians chapter 2 glory to
[1:43:59] God Amen
[1:44:01] if you dare you can say Amen
[1:44:04] if you see what this message unfold
[1:44:07] you will just quit fighting
[1:44:09] [Music]
[1:44:13] you won't have to scream too much
[1:44:17] the devil will know who that is
[1:44:21] amen amen
[1:44:24] oh God
[1:44:26] abrahamic miracle was impossible too
[1:44:30] why did God made it impossible
[1:44:33] and they call Abraham the father of our
[1:44:36] faith those faithful things that are
[1:44:39] impossible
[1:44:43] amen
[1:44:45] amen verse 4 but God
[1:44:50] who is rich in Mercy
[1:44:54] for his great water
[1:44:57] where if he water
[1:45:00] did he love you now or that loved was
[1:45:02] already in the past
[1:45:06] so God already loved you
[1:45:09] it's not today because you got saved
[1:45:11] that God love you
[1:45:12] he already loved you
[1:45:16] amen
[1:45:17] verse 5 even when we were dead in sin
[1:45:22] Paul is very specific so God loves you
[1:45:26] when you were dancing in a nightclub
[1:45:33] do you understand what I'm saying amen
[1:45:37] that's why Paul say I am what I am
[1:45:41] amen because God sees the mess that
[1:45:44] you're gonna do
[1:45:45] but his love is not the way you think
[1:45:48] you love somebody when they do good
[1:45:51] God's love is elective
[1:45:56] that's what God love is I love Jacob I
[1:46:01] hated was Jacob born no no was he so
[1:46:05] born why do you hate to eat so when he's
[1:46:07] not born
[1:46:10] the Bible said he have not even done
[1:46:12] something good or bad because what God
[1:46:14] was looking was the letter m
[1:46:17] when he just look at Esau there is
[1:46:20] nothing he opened he saw nothing he
[1:46:22] opened Jacob led to him he said I love
[1:46:24] Jacob
[1:46:26] and we expect if God love you if Jacob
[1:46:29] is born he's going to be the most
[1:46:31] beautiful humble obedience child you
[1:46:35] ever seen because God loved him before
[1:46:37] he was born
[1:46:39] as a matter of fact when they are born
[1:46:42] the one God didn't love the one God
[1:46:44] hated was the good one
[1:46:51] I'm speaking to predestined this evening
[1:46:54] now you mature way enough to understand
[1:46:57] this language and the one that God loved
[1:47:00] was the messy one
[1:47:04] amen amen let me continue even when we
[1:47:09] were dead in sin
[1:47:11] has he quickened us together with who
[1:47:15] so your quickening
[1:47:19] was not done in you first
[1:47:23] do you understand what I'm saying if
[1:47:25] you're tired I stop and we go home
[1:47:29] everybody care amen
[1:47:30] this is Christ
[1:47:34] this is Christ
[1:47:38] he says you right here
[1:47:40] everybody okay
[1:47:42] amen amen instead of God coming and
[1:47:46] working on you
[1:47:47] God doesn't work in you
[1:47:51] you want to give me a few minutes amen
[1:47:53] you can be seated
[1:47:56] God doesn't work in you
[1:48:00] amen amen amen God is working in Christ
[1:48:06] you follow me God doesn't come and
[1:48:09] Quicken you here he comes to Christ
[1:48:12] and inside of Christ he quickened you
[1:48:16] here
[1:48:19] anybody okay amen amen so your
[1:48:22] punishment
[1:48:23] is done here
[1:48:25] amen do you follow me your whooping is
[1:48:29] done here amen
[1:48:31] anybody here
[1:48:32] all your sin that you've done he put it
[1:48:35] here
[1:48:37] that's what sent Jesus to hell
[1:48:40] so if somebody already went to hell for
[1:48:42] you do you think you want to go to hell
[1:48:44] no
[1:48:45] do you qualify for her
[1:48:47] if they take you to the hell Embassy
[1:48:49] they won't give you a Visa
[1:48:52] [Music]
[1:48:54] I'm saying that so you understand you
[1:48:57] will never qualify even if you say I'm
[1:49:00] Gonna Leave This message you trying to
[1:49:01] go something will pull you back
[1:49:04] and you see somebody else living but you
[1:49:06] cannot go
[1:49:08] because you don't qualify for hell
[1:49:14] everybody okay so when God Quicken you
[1:49:17] here you are dead
[1:49:20] amen God doesn't come here to Quicken
[1:49:23] you he goes to Jesus Christ he quickens
[1:49:25] you in Jesus Christ that's why Jesus say
[1:49:28] it is
[1:49:33] amen he finished the work
[1:49:36] let me help you again so you get it did
[1:49:39] you ever seen Boaz redeeming Ruth
[1:49:44] whose Boaz redeeming roof when he went
[1:49:47] to the Elder he was speaking to the
[1:49:48] Elder that I came here to redeem roof
[1:49:51] he was redeeming who was he really
[1:49:54] looking for Naomi
[1:49:55] was the Boaz interested to marry Naomi
[1:49:59] what was he hiding in Naomi
[1:50:01] [Music]
[1:50:02] so when he's talking Naomi he was
[1:50:05] thinking he's talking about now oh yes
[1:50:07] they are Keen folks they are family
[1:50:10] member so he want to get whatever Mary I
[1:50:13] mean he want to get uh Naomi that's what
[1:50:15] you think the speech of Boaz speak of
[1:50:18] Naomi the work he's doing looks now on
[1:50:22] me everything he's discussing is about
[1:50:24] Naomi but behind Naomi today
[1:50:29] amen when Naomi passed
[1:50:36] when Naomi passed it was a package
[1:50:40] when they passed when they scare Naomi
[1:50:42] people Naomi pass whatever was inside
[1:50:45] there was qualified
[1:50:47] when the package of Naomi pass he opened
[1:50:51] the package he pulled roof
[1:50:53] and he left Naomi alone amen
[1:50:56] do you understand what I'm saying
[1:51:00] do you understand what I'm saying
[1:51:02] so God put everything that belonged to
[1:51:05] you in Jesus Christ
[1:51:07] and he had to either approve the
[1:51:09] offering of Jesus Christ or reject the
[1:51:12] offering of Jesus Christ do you know
[1:51:14] that because when Jesus resurrected Mary
[1:51:17] want to touch him he said no no no no no
[1:51:18] no no you cannot touch me now because my

[1:55:11] Jesus Christ and the other fifth doesn't
[1:55:13] understand Jesus Christ both of them did
[1:55:16] the same thing
[1:55:17] why was the other one saying no no no we
[1:55:19] did bad stuff these men didn't do
[1:55:21] anything wrong and the other one was
[1:55:23] doing the same thing the Pharisees done
[1:55:25] to Jesus Christ
[1:55:27] yet both of both three are dying
[1:55:31] but one before he goes
[1:55:38] something else kicking
[1:55:40] when Jesus stopped he said this language
[1:55:43] look familiar
[1:55:46] where did you come from
[1:55:48] he look inside he said oh God gracious
[1:55:52] I was about just about to lose you but I
[1:55:55] will lose none
[1:55:59] can I continue accept the Son of
[1:56:02] Perdition with his child here
[1:56:04] so that the scripture might be what
[1:56:10] did I help somebody
[1:56:12] did I help somebody
[1:56:14] let's continue verse 5. even when we
[1:56:17] were dead in sins has quickened us
[1:56:20] together with hope so when they were
[1:56:22] quickening Jesus Christ before you were
[1:56:24] even born they were doing your work
[1:56:28] amen
[1:56:29] amen by water
[1:56:32] are you safe
[1:56:34] because you didn't do anything they were
[1:56:36] beating somebody else
[1:56:38] you were just sitting there in Jesus
[1:56:40] Christ sleeping enjoying why Jesus is is
[1:56:44] crying my father my father amen
[1:56:48] verse 6 and has raised as what
[1:56:52] together and made us sit together in
[1:56:56] water
[1:56:57] in who
[1:57:00] are you going to make yourself sit there
[1:57:03] you have a ticket buddy
[1:57:05] it was purchased
[1:57:08] verse 7 why did Jesus do this that in
[1:57:12] the ages to come he may what
[1:57:15] the exceeding water
[1:57:17] of his water and his who
[1:57:21] toward who
[1:57:22] through home
[1:57:24] he will begin to explain
[1:57:27] verse 8 for by
[1:57:29] are you
[1:57:31] through water and that not of yourself
[1:57:37] it is the water
[1:57:41] what do you have to do
[1:57:44] verse 9 note of what
[1:57:47] less any man should water
[1:57:54] the last one verse 10
[1:57:57] for we are his water
[1:58:04] I hope you're getting that Kama created
[1:58:07] in who
[1:58:09] and to water
[1:58:11] stop they created you for what
[1:58:17] you have a software for good work
[1:58:19] [Music]
[1:58:22] amen why do you want to buy another
[1:58:24] software
[1:58:26] [Music]
[1:58:27] amen we were created for good words
[1:58:30] which God
[1:58:33] has before done what or then die we
[1:58:37] should water
[1:58:39] so who ordained the things that you're
[1:58:42] doing today
[1:58:49] that's why Christian life is not painful
[1:58:54] you can go through trial but it's not
[1:58:57] painful because you would take the heat
[1:59:00] of the child
[1:59:03] in the oven but you don't get burned
[1:59:05] when people look at you they say really
[1:59:07] you're going through everything like
[1:59:09] this but you don't even look like
[1:59:11] somebody who's going through problems
[1:59:13] are you sure all of this are happening
[1:59:15] to you yes they're all happening to you
[1:59:17] why are you so happy
[1:59:20] because normally if you go through the
[1:59:22] normal trial it should we should see the
[1:59:25] expression in your face see you sad
[1:59:27] coming to church tired so everybody can
[1:59:30] tell something is going on in that
[1:59:31] family or her husband was mad about her
[1:59:34] oh his wife doesn't love him anymore or
[1:59:37] whatever but despite everything that
[1:59:39] happened to you you must tell somebody
[1:59:42] the story for somebody to begin to see
[1:59:45] the trial
[1:59:49] what gives you that strength how did you
[1:59:52] learn learn to do it
[1:59:56] how did you learn how to do it
[1:59:59] I'm going to give you one scripture and
[2:00:00] we finish Hebrew chapter one
[2:00:09] and just giving you a summary
[2:00:12] so you get it you there
[2:00:15] Hebrew chapter 1 verse 3 if you dare we
[2:00:18] read then we're done
[2:00:19] you there
[2:00:21] who Jesus Christ being the brightness of
[2:00:25] his glory and the express image of his
[2:00:27] water
[2:00:28] in other words Jesus Is God they express
[2:00:32] image of his person and upholding
[2:00:36] or sustaining or supporting upholding
[2:00:40] all things not certain things
[2:00:43] All Things by what
[2:00:46] the word of water
[2:00:48] God uphold everything by the work of
[2:00:52] Israel by the by the word of his power
[2:00:55] that's what you heard tonight everything
[2:00:57] is sustained by the word of his power
[2:01:01] Ascend my word to heal them that word
[2:01:04] will never return void to God it will
[2:01:07] accomplish that which it has been sent
[2:01:09] everything God is sustaining that by the
[2:01:12] word it is written it is written it is
[2:01:15] written it is as long as it came out
[2:01:18] from the lips of God that's it that said
[2:01:21] amen amen amen so if God said there will
[2:01:24] be a bread
[2:01:27] why do you worry listen to the messenger
[2:01:30] he Vindicated the messenger and the
[2:01:33] Bible says if the prophet says something
[2:01:35] it happened he'll hear him that's it he
[2:01:38] Vindicated the messenger we're just
[2:01:39] listening to the instruction go left I
[2:01:42] go left go right I'll go right I don't
[2:01:44] have to worry about it because I know I
[2:01:47] am assured that I'm working toward the
[2:01:51] destination amen
[2:01:53] pressure is coming up things are going
[2:01:56] to get tight but if you rest on his word
[2:01:59] there is a man that can take the
[2:02:02] pressure off amen amen that's the place

[2:02:30] everything then God came to you and he
[2:02:33] begin to make you become in in
[2:02:36] position
[2:02:38] based on what he's looking at he said
[2:02:41] the temperature is 100 put them in 200.
[2:02:47] amen amen so when they were sending you
