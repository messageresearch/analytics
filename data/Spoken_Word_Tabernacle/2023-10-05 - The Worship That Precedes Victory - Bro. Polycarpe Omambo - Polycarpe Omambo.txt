them dancing and they are paying money for it so that they can lose weight so that they can lose some wait but here we are in the house of God in the house of God where the children of God are singing to God but you will see people [Music] quiet can you be so indifferent God always come down in the midst of worship in the midst of Praises amen amen when the when the preacher is standing here on the pulpit and you begin to say glory to God amen amen no matter your obstacle that could be in your memory or in your life God will wipe them up and God will give you the solution God reach you bless you tonight I would like to thank the Lord for this opportunity that was unexpected for me we plan with brother Steven for me to preach on the 11th and I already have a sermon for that but by yesterday morning he called me he said brother brother poop can you take the service so I have to pull something together so that we can share together I would like to thank the pastor may God richly bless him and bless his wife his children and everything that he we have a duty to pray for if we would like to be blessed we must pray for the pastor because he's the one taking care of our matters amen amen without wasting our time let's go straight to the Book of Joshua chapter Joshua chapter 6 verse 16 and verse 20 my voice good amen I'm going to read the scripture in the name of Jesus Christ and it came to pass the seventh time when the priest blew with the trumpets Joshua say unto the people shout for the Lord has given you the city drop to verse save some time [Music] so the people shouted when the priest blew with the trumpet and it came to pass when the people heard the sound of the trumpet and the people shouted with a great shout that the war fell down flat so that the people went up into the city every man straight before him and they took the city go to zear 4 verse Zechariah 4:7 who are th oh great Mountain before zerel thou shall become a plane and he shall bring forth the headson thereof with shoutings crying Grace Grace unto it let's pray if you have a request tonight just uh acknowledge it by an uplifted hand heavenly father father we coming in your presence you the the god that can change water into wine and to bring somebody who was dead to life we coming tonight in your PR you see the hands of your children and our hands because you're the present help in the times of Father we thank you for everything you have done in our life for this opportunity you have given us to come in brought us into your presence thank you for all things and we want you to take the glory in all things come and move us completely out May you take a full control of take this service under control take a control in everything everything that doesn't depart from this place in the name of Jesus father you saw the hand maybe some are sick maybe they have a need maybe a financial need maybe a health need or they might they want to maybe someone want to mared maybe they need children maybe they need a certain document maybe they need children someone want to be touched father we are giving all and we magnify you and we thank you Lord in Jesus precious name bless the reading of the word take the control of everything in Jesus precious name amen amen bless you you might be seated my subject tonight is the worship that precedes Victory amen amen as you notice where we read in the Book of Joshua we only look at two verse verse 16 but the whole chapter it's about the story all of us are aware of it Joshua had to take over the city of Jero amen amen but Jer had might Warriors that were living there amen amen and nobody was was able to take the city and God gave them the city and God gave them instructions that they have to follow amen amen and you will notice when they went to Jero they never took any weapon they never carry something they never take took a amen they only follow God's instructions amen amen and they were just going around the city as God instructed them and at the seventh day at the seventh time God spoke he told them that the priest will blow the trumpet and after the blowing of the trumpet you will shout amen amen and you will just shout you don't have to say anything else but it's like tonight you want to worship God you want to glorify God you want to testify about God you want to thank God when you are thanking the lord God will do exceedingly and abundantly above all you can think and God will open the doors that were closed amen amen just by worshiping just by praising him just by testifying just by thanking him because we are remembering his good feed amen amen and Joshua applied the word he did it and they were praising the Lord they were singing and they shouted and the walls of Jericho went flat down what is the walls of Jericho for your life what is that Jero that is standing in front of you amen amen if you can only shout if you can only say glory to [Music] God you don't want to wait for the preacher to tell you say Amen the preacher to instruct you say glory to God when he comes from yourself God take care of your problem and then he will take care of your sickness then he will take care of your finances then he will take care of your situation that's why you saw when we went to Zechariah Chapter 4 where God is asking a question who are that great Mountain you will come down because he will bring with shouting amen amen the the the the food that God eat it's worship when you look in Revelation chapter 5 when John was there when he was before the L and there was a book that no one was able to take and when you continue with the story you will notice this that even in heaven the whole family in heaven they were only worshiping where we are going the heaven we going me and you it's a heaven of worship amen amen nobody will preach over there amen amen we will only worship we will only say Glory Hallelujah saying hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah glory glory to God that's all we will do in heaven and you will notice every time you worship [Music] God God always does something no matter your condition no matter your situation but God is able to do something about it amen amen I'm going to read something the identification of Christ in all ages in paragraph five 1964 April 9th brother Bram says this we pray for the sick and we don't claim to be a Healer or somebody can heal someone we believe that there is only one Healer that is God but we believe that he ordained man to pray for the sick and we do that we pray for the sick and the Lord has been gracious to us to answer our prayers so many times and we around the world we have seen well just multiply thousand time thousand of people cre Afflicted blind lame blind and then the and we just believe that us the Bible say he was wounded for our transgression with his trap we were healed and we believe that is the benefit that is the privilege of two given to the Believers amen amen let me go to paragraph seven amen it doesn't make us to be a Healer no more than the preaching of Salvation it doesn't make us Sav we know that there is only one Healer and we know that there is only one and it's the only person the same the Lord Jesus Christ we are here to glorify him in the midst of the people amen Amen brother Bram is showing that we we PR [Music] we are not the one healing the people but we are only fulfilling our duty to pray for the sick even if you go to the hospital you meet a doctor it's the same thing they can only take care of you so that God can take over amen with healing amen because healing only belongs to [Applause] God uh give me some time let me take off my suit amen amen blessed be the name of the Lord that's why you would notice in the sermon Jehovah in 1959 Ro brother Bram was speaking about John Ryan he was a blind man and brother Bram prayed for him and after a while the man was still blond he said I cannot see and brother Bram told him there is one thing you need to do just go ahead and continue to testify that I can see and one day so he was at the barber shop and if you notice John when he went to the bar shop the his b begin to mock [Music] him and he told him you went to that Divine healer and they told me that you were healed can you see John Ryan he never compromised with his faith he didn't play with the word he say whatever God declare about me and he took a hold of what God told him if only tonight you can also take a hold of what God told you and he says yes I can see he say praise the Lord I can see and suddenly his eyes popped up open amen amen the problem today we Christian is that Christian don't know where they're standing no matter their situation when Jesus faced the devil when the devil was tempting him Jesus always reply it is written because the devil knew a portion of the word and Jesus said it is also written he never went away from the [Music] word one day he was uh at he was in the synagogue and then he read the book Jesus said today this day this scripture has been fulfilled and that scripture belong to Christ amen amen it was a scripture that pertained to and Jesus was the hair and we are joint with him if there is a scripture that belong to the group my brother my sister that same scripture that they also spoke about you God also spoke about you in the word why don't you take the promises of God what God is speaking about you when you face a situation when You Face a problem when You Face sickness just use the [Music] scripture for instance I'm sick what did he declare about me am the Lord that healed thee from all that there is no exception about the sickness so when you repeat that God T about it and the prophet spoke the responsibility is to you to confess it knows what is in your heart but God won't do it if you don't confess God already taught his servant his servant already spoke now the responsibility is up to you to take and then to speak it back amen amen God spoke so many things everything is in the Holy SC God spoke about you in the Bible when you facing a situation when You Face a goath Goliath can take many forms in your life David face a physical Goliath so what kind of Goliath have you met because one day David was delivered from a lion and also from the bear you won't tell me tonight that God never delivered you for a situation one that you don't even have a testimony in your life where God that God never hear you one day in your life that God never help you in the time of trouble used his past experience in facing Goliath and he says the same God that delivered me from the lion from The Bear he's more than able to take care of this uncircum so that I can cut his head off amen amen that's what David did you also have many testimonies in your life we have several testimonies in our life that we don't even testified to others we are so selfish to give Faith to another child of God we are holding our testimonies amen amen glory to God let me read something in the book of act act the first chapter 7 to8 the bible says this and he said unto them it is not for you to know the times or the seasons which the father has put in his own power [Music] for but you shall receive power after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you and you shall be witness unto me both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and in Samaria and unto the other most part of the earth amen amen in the sermon why was the Holy Ghost given paragraph 20 I'm just skipping so that we can save time it's a Wednesday so God help us amen amen okay let it says this now we know what the Holy Ghost is we found out last night that it's God so the Holy Ghost is the very person of God can you imagine the person of God in [Applause] you God who could look at the sea and then the sea can be parted together and that same God is living in you can you just think about the problem is we don't realize we don't realize who we really are amen amen Christian today they don't realize who they are one day Peter with Jesus Christ and then the boat begin to be tossed to and FL and the disciple went and awakened Jesus because Jesus was sleeping in the boat maybe he was tired amen amen and they went and they W up Master you don't care we perishing amen amen that same Jesus Christ is in you when you facing a situation that is trou you can go wake that God he's not far away he is in you he's even closer to you he's not far that's what brother is driving that's the Holy Ghost is nothing else the very person of God in you and that person of God is in you brother Bram say let's say it like this all that God was he ped it into Christ because God emptied himself and he poured it into Christ and Christ was the fullness of the godhead B all that Jehovah was he poured it into Christ amen amen and all that CHR was he ped it into the church not into one individual but into the entire body there where we come together in unity we have power all that God was was in Christ and all that Christ was is in you amen amen and you will notice in act chapter 1 verse 8 Jesus spoke to the disciple and told them that when you will receive the Holy Ghost the power from high will come over you you will be my Witnesses amen amen not the witness of someone else but the witness of God beginning from Jerusalem to the utmost part of the earth a Christian is a witness for God a Christian is a distributor of the power of God you are a distributor of the word of God amen amen in other words you are God MTH peace this is what God spoke here you will be my witness to witness to who where toward the people everywhere even at work you must testify about you must spoke about you are God mouth peace a work you are God mouth peace but sometime we neglect oursel blessed be the name of the Lord let's go straight to another spot a trumpet giving an uncertain sound 1963 on January the 14th paragraph 274 brother says this he that Heth my words believe on him that sent me has present not in the past not in the future present tense everlasting life and shall not come to judgment but he passed from Death the holy spirit is an experience of being filled and undo with power for service but confession and receiving Christ is to have faith and make your confession and feel free that God has forgiven you of your sins and upon the basis of his word he said [Music] no man can come except my father CH him first first see now God Jo you first and he that will come to me I will know out see you have received it only thing you have you have he died for you your sins were forgiven 1900 years ago 2,000 years now just think about if you were born in 200 something or 19 something your were already forgiven 2,000 years ago [Music] why you still condemning yourself you know I'm I'm I'm going through this battle because of what I did in the past you are condemning yourself for nothing there is one that you can't compare with anyone you never sin there is only one person it's the Lord Jesus Christ no matter what did in the P about what he paid the price on Calvary that he already paid the price on Calvary you just have to confess it to accept it and you move on when you confess it when you worship him and you glorify him the remaining God will take care of worship precede the baptism of the Holy Ghost in act chapter 2 when the disciple were gathered together in the upper room over there they were only praising God they were glorifying God they were worshiping God just by worshiping God the Holy Ghost came down upon them am amen the Holy Ghost came down upon them and they spoke in tongues and there were many gift that were uh quickened and that same God is the same tonight he's the same yesterday today and forever what you can do my brother is just to worship him it's to glorify him if you remember that woman sinful woman she never even requested to be forgiven she just worshiped God she just took whatever she has the best to give to [Applause] God maybe one day we'll talk about it to tell you that many ways of praying am amen it is not just all the time Lord Give Me Lord Give Me Lord they are prayer of worship prayer of Thanksgiving when you doing those kind of prayers God will begin to unlock doors he will unlock doors am amen whether it's for a work whether it's for to get married or to have a child God is able to do that God is able to do that God is able to do that let me read something again the God of this evil age brother Bram says this in paragraph 56 the God of this evil I'm going to start from there speaking about the two spirit in the churches we have the denomination and we we we who are in the message amen they might say all God doesn't heal anymore and so forth brother Bram said the two Spirits one of them God's holy spirit the other one the devil Spirit working Inception working in deception the people of the Earth are now making their choice like tonight which Choice are you going to take because we always facing a choice we have the message of the hour amen amen the message that have been Vindicated by the pillar of fire and the pillar of fire followed this message the same Pillar of Fire that that met Paul the same Pillar of Fire was with brother Bram and you will notice brother Bram is not living today he's not living to but the message is still there and where this message has been follow even if you playing T and it's playing we have testimonies of the pillar of fire that was with brother Bram have testimony about it amen amen amen blessed be the name of the lordu when you say hallelujah glory to God when you saying amen when you are clapping God take care of your problem amen amen because God feeds on worship on praises like we saw that the Capstone when he comes somebody's shouting somebody's praising takes care of the situation am amen never look at your problem when a preacher pray for you when you pray about the problem don't come back again with the request you start glorifying God about you start thanking God about it God God will never let himself be God will never let himself be made part of for somebody who's testifying about him and God will let you go like that God will take care of

reminding you that I am the Lord that take care of your sicknesses God says you will walk upon scorpions and they won't hurt you he spoke he says there won't be a bar woman in my all those are but you need to see God never wrote them for somebody else he wrote it for me he wrote them for me I don't know your problem but I'm talking about me he wrote the scripture for me let me give you a [Music] testimony I'm I found God gave me a job where I'm working now [Music] the boss of the company he was recommended by someone else but I saw him and he spoke about someone about me remembering my name and they gave him my number and he called me and they gave me the job and when they gave me the position uh uh propos me a salary and according to everybody that was doing the same task I'm doing they give me a higher salary than them so on the 10th day the people people that I found there working they have difficult cases and they took those cases and then passed the back toward me and on the 10th day the boss came he looked he said how are you working I say I'm still working the same way but I found [Music] out that the people are here they are unable to do certain things because I'm they are telling me what to do at work he says but I know you already you can work I say yes I will he asked me he say how long do you want me to give you so you can finish this task I say I don't know I said he look at me he say I give you 30 minutes if you don't finish the job in 30 minutes you'll be fired uh because I don't want you to fire you're going to fire yourself I say me I won't go nowhere because at my house they know that I came to work this is what I told my family I'm going to work and then at that time I didn't have time to pray but it was time to speak I look at the bus I say I'm not going home I came to work and I won't go home like that he say I'm going to give you two hours I'm going to give you this I'm going to give you this and then he left and then in the morning he came I didn't finish the work so I went the next day and he didn't come that day in the morning and I worked and I pray God I say Lord here and I need your touch so whatever I will be touching in this work you touch it amen amen I want everything that my hand will lay on to be perfect and God be to work like that and everything was perfect and I took even pictur and I sent him pictures he came back he say I know you he say you know you are a man that are recommended to be hired in this company you didn't even go apply for a job I'm the one who called you and as you are you are representing me in this job because I told the people in this company this man knows how to work that's why you must work extra even if you have to run you must run to show them you must be above everybody now he's giving me advices and if the first day with the tension he gave me because the devil was telling me that if he spoke to you like that just leave it go something was in me that say say I'm no I'm going nowhere because when you left home you spoke you say wherever wherever the soul of my foot will be put I will possess that so this I possess just little testimony amen amen and then everything went well and there was a brother he told me I have a problem with a car he uh his car broke down but he want to go to church I told him I said brother but all you have to do is pray when they say pray in

been tormented you talking to your father he is the true father amen amen no matter the situation you speak to him like a child speak face to face to and your father will answer in your prayer when
