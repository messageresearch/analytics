[25:44] i have been taking medicine for thyroid
[25:47] for many years
[25:50] but
[25:51] for some reason i just felt in my heart
[25:53] to stop taking it over a year ago
[25:56] but
[25:57] the doctor didn't agree with me but
[26:00] i kind of told her that i was still
[26:02] taking it but i wasn't but about what
[26:05] three or four months ago when i went to
[26:06] panama
[26:08] i went to the doctor and
[26:11] i told him that i would like some
[26:13] like a test to check my thyroid so they
[26:16] checked it and it was normal
[26:18] so when i came back i went to the doctor
[26:21] here in charlotte and
[26:23] because we don't have health insurance
[26:24] right now but i went to some some other
[26:27] doctor that someone recommended me so i
[26:28] went over there and i told her that uh
[26:31] she did a physical and she said you're
[26:33] taking any medication and i say
[26:35] no right now i said i was suffering with
[26:37] thyroid but no not any longer and she's
[26:40] like you do know that once you suffer
[26:42] from tyro you will never stop taking the
[26:44] medications she said you will be on that
[26:46] medication until you die
[26:49] and and i said well can you check it she
[26:51] goes okay
[26:52] and
[26:53] her nurse told me the same thing you
[26:55] shouldn't stop taking it because you
[26:57] take medication for tyler forever so
[26:59] anyways they did
[27:01] they took bald blood and they did the
[27:03] test and about thursday they called me
[27:06] they told me all my exams all the tests
[27:09] came out
[27:10] normal that i didn't have
[27:16] [Applause]
[27:25] amen
[27:29] hallelujah
[27:31] she was real happy we were coming
[27:32] through the mountains and
[27:34] somehow got that message when we got a
[27:36] signal we drove through a portion of a
[27:38] place up there um called crusoe
[27:41] and apparently this last hurricane that
[27:43] went through ida i guess
[27:46] the flooding was really bad we were
[27:48] driving through and there was a lot of
[27:49] campgrounds right on the river a river
[27:52] but all you saw were piles of rubble
[27:55] stick you know boards and
[27:57] there'd be i mean
[27:59] cars in the tree
[28:01] boats in the ditch a jet ski in the
[28:04] middle of a field
[28:06] and i you know we just kind of just
[28:08] asked god for mercy on those people
[28:09] because i had never seen anything like
[28:11] that
[28:12] i was i experienced some flooding up in
[28:14] north dakota on the red river when the
[28:16] snow's melted but never
[28:18] never the damage like this
[28:20] so
[28:21] um this is kind of north of brevard and
[28:23] south of waynesville area
[28:25] so i was just kind of you know it was
[28:27] very
[28:28] humbling to see the damage
[28:32] okay
[28:34] so any more prayer requests
[28:36] yes ma'am

[47:47] amen
[47:48] everybody clear
[47:49] okay if you're behind it's on youtube
[47:54] genesis chapter 15.
[47:56] after these things the word of the lord
[47:59] came to abram
[48:01] in a vision
[48:02] we read this on wednesday but could not
[48:04] get into it
[48:06] saying fear not abram
[48:08] i am your shield
[48:10] and your exceeding great
[48:13] reward everybody clear
[48:15] you might be seated
[48:17] and keep your bible with you because we
[48:19] need it
[48:23] it should work now brother robert let me
[48:25] see
[48:32] let me see now
[48:37] okay somebody need to be in tune with me
[48:42] go ahead and click it

[48:56] maybe somebody's gonna stay there
[48:57] clicking it
[49:00] i trust that we can get wired together
[49:03] with the holy spirit verse two
[49:06] and abraham said lord god
[49:09] what will you give me
[49:11] seeing i go childless
[49:14] and the steward of my house is this
[49:17] eliezer of damascus in other words god i
[49:21] don't have a child
[49:22] and based on my human ability there is
[49:25] someone here in my house called eliezer
[49:28] i believe this is the one you are
[49:30] actually pointing me that he's going to
[49:31] be the heir
[49:33] and god answer abraham in verse 3 he say
[49:36] behold and abraham said behold to me you
[49:39] have given no seed i'm sorry and no one
[49:42] born in my house is my heir
[49:45] verse 4 and behold the word of the lord
[49:47] came to him saying
[49:49] this shall not be your heir not earlier
[49:52] of damascus this is human ability
[49:55] but
[49:56] he that shall come forth out of your own
[49:58] bowels
[50:00] shall be your heir everybody clear
[50:03] verse five and he brought him forth
[50:05] abroad in other words come out of your
[50:07] house
[50:08] and say
[50:10] look now toward heaven everybody clear
[50:14] so we got to go back again in the heaven
[50:17] if you were there on
[50:18] wednesday it makes sense
[50:21] look toward heaven
[50:23] when i say it makes sense it's not this
[50:25] brain here before somebody say he's
[50:27] saying making sense making sense
[50:29] amen look now toward heaven
[50:32] and tell the star so god attracted
[50:36] abraham attention to the storm
[50:39] in other words you're looking too much
[50:41] earthly
[50:43] the problem is not on the earth the
[50:44] problem is way down in heaven amen
[50:48] tell the star if you'll be able to
[50:51] number them and he said to him so shall
[50:55] your seed remember on wednesday singular
[50:58] not plural so shall your seed be so what
[51:02] abraham looked at that was not really
[51:05] the natural star but abraham look into
[51:08] christ
[51:10] amen but christ has a bunch of stars
[51:14] or a bunch of seeds
[51:16] you remember the morning stars
[51:19] amen
[51:20] blessed be the name of the lord
[51:22] let's go to number chapter 16.
[51:25] so keep that in mind the stars are in
[51:28] heaven
[51:29] and god told abraham look at those stars
[51:32] that's the way that you see it is going
[51:34] to be
[51:35] amen
[51:37] hallelujah
[51:40] number chapter 16. if you dare you can
[51:43] say amen
[51:46] quite a bit of reading i might try to
[51:48] skip some of them
[51:50] verse 1
[51:52] now korra the son of isa
[51:56] the son of gohan
[51:58] the son of who
[52:00] so korra was a leaver
[52:02] and if you need a scripture he was
[52:04] actually a cousin
[52:06] to moses
[52:08] if you need a scripture you see me i'm
[52:09] going to show you
[52:11] korra was a cousin to moses
[52:14] so he was fighting his own cousin
[52:19] from the same tribe right
[52:21] not all israel is
[52:26] and dayton
[52:28] and abiram
[52:29] the sons of elia
[52:31] and on the son of pellet sons of ruben
[52:35] they took men plural
[52:37] after everything that moses have done
[52:40] after all the demonstration that moses
[52:42] said after all the
[52:44] vindication that moses came
[52:48] who would have thought somebody can
[52:50] rebel against moses
[52:53] what a vindication
[52:54] a man when he's walking
[52:57] by night you can see a light going on
[53:01] and everybody sees it
[53:03] not only moses himself everybody see the
[53:06] pillar of fire by day you can see the
[53:08] pillar of fire moving
[53:10] you thought all israel will be scared
[53:13] like you know what we can't touch this
[53:14] man
[53:15] but no
[53:17] the star the zodiac is working
[53:20] verse two and they rose up before moses
[53:23] with certain of the children of israel
[53:26] not the hidden
[53:28] we are in israel
[53:31] 250 princes of the assembly
[53:36] so among those that god rescued from
[53:38] egypt
[53:40] 250 pieces
[53:43] kora
[53:44] dayton abram
[53:46] didn't really
[53:48] go with the message really
[53:52] amen
[53:53] families in the congregation
[53:56] not ordinary people
[53:59] famous people
[54:00] men of renown
[54:03] the entire world knows them
[54:05] [Music]
[54:08] 250.
[54:10] and they gathered themselves together
[54:13] against who
[54:16] and against who
[54:18] moses was the prophetic ministry
[54:21] and aaron was the priesthood
[54:24] and said to them
[54:26] you take too much upon you
[54:29] all the time moses said moses say moses
[54:32] say what he's saying
[54:35] all the
[54:36] time the whole congregation of israel is
[54:40] holy
[54:41] why only is it that only two people are
[54:44] holy
[54:47] you take too much upon you
[54:50] seeing all the congregation of water
[54:53] in other words everybody you just like
[54:55] anybody
[54:56] [Music]
[54:58] but it seems like your position is a
[55:00] little bit higher than anybody
[55:02] [Music]
[55:04] every one of them and the lord is among
[55:07] them it is not just you
[55:10] everybody can preach the gospel
[55:12] amen
[55:15] wherefore then lift you up yourself
[55:18] above the water
[55:20] you know who did that in heaven right
[55:23] he was luciferite
[55:28] appointing moses
[55:30] to be like a lucifer
[55:36] a mix
[55:39] verse 4 and when moses heard it
[55:42] he fell upon his face
[55:44] and spoke to who
[55:46] i thought there were three of them
[55:49] all four
[55:50] why only korra
[55:55] the big shot
[55:56] and he spoke to korra
[55:58] and to all his water
[56:00] so everybody was behind cora
[56:06] moses and his cousin
[56:09] micah and lucifer
[56:13] micah has his angel
[56:16] his company lucifer also have his angel
[56:22] but at the beginning both of them serve
[56:24] god
[56:26] until a certain time the separation
[56:28] happen
[56:32] god never created the devil
[56:36] you remember that
[56:37] he didn't create satan
[56:39] he created lucifer
[56:42] satan came after lucifer
[56:48] okay blessed be the name of the lord
[56:52] and this
[56:53] and spoke to cora and to all his
[56:56] companies saying even tomorrow the lord
[56:59] will show who is who are who
[57:02] and who is
[57:04] in other words you thought the entire
[57:07] congregation of israel is holy
[57:11] god is going to show you who belongs to
[57:13] him and who is truly holy
[57:17] amen
[57:18] and will cause him to come near to him
[57:21] even him whom he has chosen will he
[57:24] cause to come near to him so there is
[57:28] one that was chosen
[57:31] here and god is going to designate who
[57:33] is that person
[57:35] verse six
[57:36] this do
[57:37] take you censors korra and all his
[57:41] company
[57:43] and put fire therein
[57:45] and put incense in them before the lord
[57:47] tomorrow and it shall be that the man
[57:50] whom the lord does choose
[57:52] he shall be who
[57:54] you take too much upon you you sons of
[57:57] hope
[58:02] you exaggerated
[58:05] you got the priesthood so you think you
[58:06] can tackle anybody
[58:09] verse 8 and moses said to korra
[58:12] here i pray you you sons of liver he's
[58:15] talking to korra
[58:18] but sons of liver
[58:20] since it but a small thing to you that
[58:23] the god of israel has separated you from
[58:27] the congregation of israel to bring you
[58:29] near to himself to do the service of the
[58:32] tabernacle of the lord and to stand
[58:35] before the congregation to minister to
[58:36] him
[58:37] god already gave you a position
[58:43] you're already by predestination
[58:46] as a leaver
[58:48] you already have a mistake
[58:52] or a position
[58:54] like lucifer god already gave it to you
[58:58] now you're trying to lose that position
[59:01] what's going on anybody
[59:03] verse 10 and he has brought you near
[59:07] to him like like lucifer the right hand
[59:10] man of god
[59:11] and all your brethren the sons of liver
[59:13] with you and seek you the priesthood
[59:16] also
[59:20] when we talk about liver
[59:23] liver was divided between the leviton
[59:27] and the priest
[59:30] here
[59:31] the priest came from aaron
[59:34] and the remaining sons of liver were
[59:37] levat working also in the tabernacle
[59:40] everybody
[59:42] so cora was here
[59:46] he already have a position chosen by god
[59:49] and moses is saying god already gave you
[59:53] your position
[59:55] but it seems like you are not satisfied
[1:00:00] with the position god will give you
[1:00:02] and you want to leave this position
[1:00:05] and to become priests
[1:00:10] lucifer i already gave you a throne i
[1:00:14] already gave you a position
[1:00:16] but lucifer was not satisfied with the
[1:00:19] position god gave him
[1:00:21] lucifer want to rise above the star of
[1:00:24] god and be like the most high
[1:00:28] so there is any satisfaction to the
[1:00:32] position
[1:00:33] in the quran
[1:00:35] everybody clear
[1:00:37] so seek you the priesthood also do you
[1:00:39] want the priesthood now you already got
[1:00:41] a position
[1:00:42] chosen by god given by god you're not
[1:00:45] satisfied there now you want to take a
[1:00:47] different position
[1:00:49] for which cause both you and your
[1:00:52] company and all your company are
[1:00:54] gathered together against who
[1:00:56] i thought they were against moses
[1:01:02] standing against moses is standing
[1:01:04] against him
[1:01:06] and what is aaron
[1:01:08] that's inaudible
[1:01:10] that you murmur against him
[1:01:12] and moses sent to call dayton and
[1:01:15] abhiram and the son of eliab which said
[1:01:19] we will not come up
[1:01:21] so when they call them lack of respect
[1:01:24] i won't go
[1:01:26] tell him i'm not coming up
[1:01:29] spirit don't die
[1:01:33] spirit don't die
[1:01:35] they don't die they're still living
[1:01:36] today amen
[1:01:39] look at these people
[1:01:40] they told moses go tell moses
[1:01:43] i'm not coming up
[1:01:45] i won't come back anymore
[1:01:47] amen
[1:01:48] is he a small thing that you have
[1:01:51] brought us up out of the land that flows
[1:01:53] what
[1:01:55] and what
[1:01:57] was milk and honey flowing in egypt
[1:02:04] am i reading a different bible
[1:02:07] if milka honey was flowing in egypt
[1:02:10] why were you crying
[1:02:14] [Music]
[1:02:15] now they brought you out of egypt
[1:02:18] to the message of the hour
[1:02:20] now egypt become milk and honey
[1:02:25] [Music]
[1:02:32] oh my god
[1:02:35] to kill us in the wilderness
[1:02:38] except you make yourself altogether
[1:02:41] water
[1:02:43] so you brought us here so you can make a
[1:02:45] move and you be the top so all the time
[1:02:49] moses said moses said moses said amen
[1:02:54] brother branham say brother brother i'm
[1:02:56] saying brother branham say now it's a
[1:02:59] show man
[1:03:02] 14
[1:03:03] moreover you have not brought us into a
[1:03:06] land that flows with milk and honey in
[1:03:09] other words you're a liar
[1:03:14] [Music]
[1:03:19] [Applause]
[1:03:22] they were geared to material stuff
[1:03:25] we want a prosperity gospel
[1:03:28] or giving us inheritance of field
[1:03:32] and vineyard
[1:03:33] when you put up would you when you put
[1:03:36] up the eyes of this man
[1:03:38] you won't deceive us
[1:03:39] we will not come up
[1:03:43] and moses was very angry
[1:03:45] and said to the lord
[1:03:47] respect not you their offering
[1:03:50] i have not taken one ass from them
[1:03:53] neither have i heard one of them and
[1:03:55] moses said to her
[1:03:58] be
[1:03:59] you and all your company
[1:04:01] before the lord you and day
[1:04:04] and aaron tomorrow
[1:04:06] and take every man his censor and put
[1:04:09] incense in them and bring you before the
[1:04:12] lord every man his censor

[1:04:35] who
[1:04:36] so these levites were wicked

[1:04:48] this is god giving his sentence
[1:04:50] wicked man and touch not
[1:04:53] touch nothing of theirs
[1:04:55] lest you be consumed in all their sins
[1:04:58] amen
[1:04:59] verse 27
[1:05:01] so they gather from the tabernacle of

[1:07:57] underneath the earth
[1:07:59] into hell
[1:08:00] and the earth closed upon them so that
[1:08:03] earth open and close
[1:08:07] you okay
[1:08:08] and they perish from among them
[1:08:11] god removed that portion among the
[1:08:14] congregation that portion of israel that
[1:08:17] was not israel god pack them together
[1:08:20] gather them together separate yourself
[1:08:23] now there is a clear demarcation okay
[1:08:26] let me now swallow that up
[1:08:28] anybody clear
[1:08:30] and all israel that were round about
[1:08:32] them fled and cry of them for they said
[1:08:35] lest the earth swallows up swallow us up
[1:08:39] also and there came out a water
[1:08:43] there is a peat and a fire
[1:08:45] and a fire from the lord and consumed
[1:08:48] the
[1:08:49] 250 men that offered water
[1:08:56] kora elevate
[1:08:58] a cousin to moses part of israel
[1:09:01] at the beginning serve god
[1:09:03] in the meekness and quietness but after
[1:09:06] a while rose against
[1:09:09] moses
[1:09:10] but he was not alone he has a company
[1:09:13] that belongs to him
[1:09:16] we clear now
[1:09:18] now let's go to the book of revelation
[1:09:21] we start from abraham from abraham his
[1:09:24] seed are the stars of heaven
[1:09:26] amen
[1:09:27] so we believe now that we understand now
[1:09:30] that every star of heaven are children
[1:09:32] of abraham
[1:09:35] let's see revelation chapter 12.
[1:09:39] revelation chapter 12 verse 3.
[1:09:43] if you dare you can say amen
[1:09:49] hallelujah you there
[1:09:52] and there appear another wonder in water
[1:09:56] we're back again here
[1:09:59] we clear
[1:10:01] in heaven
[1:10:04] and behold a great head red dragon
[1:10:08] having seven heads and ten horns and
[1:10:11] seven crowns upon his head everybody
[1:10:13] knows that dragon
[1:10:15] the old
[1:10:17] who is the
[1:10:19] okay you need that scripture you can go
[1:10:21] back to the other one
[1:10:22] verse 4 and his tale
[1:10:27] what kind of tell is that one
[1:10:29] drew
[1:10:30] the water
[1:10:32] part of water
[1:10:34] so not all the star of heaven
[1:10:38] belongs to abraham
[1:10:41] because a third of them
[1:10:43] were
[1:10:44] completely removed
[1:10:46] by the dragon
[1:10:47] amen at the beginning the star belonged
[1:10:50] to abraham
[1:10:52] at the beginning all israel behind moses
[1:10:56] but a dragon must rise in the wilderness
[1:11:00] and get his company
[1:11:02] from under moses
[1:11:05] we clear now
[1:11:07] and the third part of the stars of
[1:11:09] heaven indeed cast them to the water
[1:11:12] so somebody fall
[1:11:16] somebody fell from heaven
[1:11:18] they had a position in heaven but the
[1:11:20] dragon took them from heavenly position
[1:11:24] and brought them to a carnal position
[1:11:27] everybody
[1:11:28] so somebody lost their first position
[1:11:31] therefore their position were in heaven
[1:11:34] now they begin to be creature of thee
[1:11:38] it's a losing opposition everybody clear
[1:11:43] amen indeed cast them to the earth and
[1:11:45] the dragon stood before the woman which
[1:11:47] was ready to be delivered for to devour
[1:11:50] her child as soon as he was born number
[1:11:54] one the stars of heaven are the children
[1:11:57] of abraham
[1:11:58] all of them christ
[1:12:00] here
[1:12:01] but we found out that everybody under
[1:12:03] moses but not really everybody a leader
[1:12:06] one must rise
[1:12:08] and get his children or his company
[1:12:10] together
[1:12:11] amen and in the book of revelation the
[1:12:14] star of heaven some of them have been
[1:12:17] deceived by lucifer
[1:12:19] let's go to genesis chapter 25 then
[1:12:21] we're going to pray you open your bible
[1:12:23] right there and you leave it right there
[1:12:26] that's why we stop

[1:12:48] you again humbly this morning father
[1:12:50] thanking you for everything and for
[1:12:53] giving us an opportunity to be gathered

[1:13:49] god bless you you've already been seated
[1:13:51] praise be the name of the lord we on
[1:13:53] origin part nine amen
[1:13:56] we already discussed about this and
[1:13:58] we've seen that there are two camp
[1:14:00] based on the origin or two kingdom
[1:14:03] one is the eternal camp which is the
[1:14:06] camp of god
[1:14:07] and the other camp is the temporal camp
[1:14:10] which is the camp of lucifer and his
[1:14:12] children ever clear
[1:14:14] when we look at the eternal camp brother
[1:14:17] branham says in the things that ought to
[1:14:19] be he says the only way that you can be
[1:14:22] a son
[1:14:24] come on a daughter of god because you
[1:14:26] have to have eternal life
[1:14:29] and there is only one form of eternal
[1:14:32] life and that is god's life
[1:14:35] only one form of eternal life and that
[1:14:37] was god
[1:14:39] to be a son of god you have to be in him
[1:14:42] how many time
[1:14:45] that's why we are eternal
[1:14:48] with god brother david just a little bit
[1:14:51] amen
[1:14:52] the gene of your life
[1:14:55] not your natural life
[1:14:57] your spiritual life tonight was in hole
[1:15:00] in god the father because he's your uh
[1:15:03] the one that a general you he said
[1:15:06] the god the father before there was even
[1:15:09] a molecule
[1:15:11] about here
[1:15:13] and you are nothing but the
[1:15:15] manifestation of the gene life that was
[1:15:18] in god
[1:15:19] as a son of god now you are expressed
[1:15:23] after his word has come in you remember
[1:15:26] the word coming to the word the present
[1:15:28] sinister seed which is the china tap
[1:15:31] everybody clear to light up this age you
[1:15:34] are expressing god's life in you
[1:15:37] because you are a son or a daughter of
[1:15:40] god therefore you get what i mean
[1:15:42] congregation saying
[1:15:45] you are now made you are sitting in this
[1:15:49] church tonight because your duty is to
[1:15:52] express god to this nation
[1:15:55] and to these people and to this
[1:15:57] neighborhood here where you associate
[1:16:01] so based on your origin there is a
[1:16:05] purpose for you on this earth
[1:16:07] either you're going to be a vessel of
[1:16:09] mercy that's going to show the riches of
[1:16:12] glory of jesus christ
[1:16:15] or you're going to be a vessel of wrath
[1:16:18] that is going to show how god can
[1:16:20] demonstrate his judgment upon someone
[1:16:24] everybody clear so far
[1:16:25] now as we're looking at this we went
[1:16:28] into the angelic realms
[1:16:31] but before we get into the angelic realm
[1:16:33] i want you to remember this
[1:16:36] brother bonham says that any bible
[1:16:39] readers
[1:16:41] knows that all scripture has a compound
[1:16:44] meaning
[1:16:46] every prophecy
[1:16:48] some almost all of it has a water
[1:16:52] a jew a time there or two times or water
[1:16:57] that it shall be answered as a revolving
[1:17:00] of what
[1:17:02] so prophecy can begin now and he's gonna
[1:17:05] repeat it again and repeat it again and
[1:17:07] repeat it again and repeat it again amen
[1:17:10] because god has an unchanged pattern
[1:17:13] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:17:17] you can predict god bless you so far
[1:17:20] now as we get into these angelic realms
[1:17:23] here the bible says this one here
[1:17:26] even though we have two kingdoms we have
[1:17:30] the kingdom of the devil and we have the
[1:17:32] kingdom of god according to matthew 13
[1:17:36] there were there was only one field
[1:17:40] amen there were one field about two
[1:17:43] everybody clear the first sword went and
[1:17:47] saw first el bakir and the other one
[1:17:49] came later on when people were sleeping
[1:17:52] everybody
[1:17:53] so they were two seed into one field
[1:17:56] amen
[1:17:57] now that field the scripture said the
[1:17:59] field was the world
[1:18:01] so that shows that in this world here
[1:18:04] god have his children scatter all over
[1:18:08] the world
[1:18:10] some are in america
[1:18:13] some are in africa
[1:18:16] some are in europe
[1:18:18] some are in south america some are in
[1:18:21] asia some are in australia all of them
[1:18:25] are scattered all around the world
[1:18:28] but we came from one source
[1:18:31] the division of the nation of the earth
[1:18:34] is uh is responsible for our separation
[1:18:39] but surely we came from one source
[1:18:42] that's why the bible says in the book of
[1:18:44] revelation chapter 5
[1:18:47] that
[1:18:47] they sang a new song saying that are
[1:18:51] worthy
[1:18:52] to take the book and to open the seals
[1:18:55] thereof for that was slain come on and
[1:18:59] has done water
[1:19:01] bring us back to god
[1:19:03] by that blood out of water
[1:19:06] and water and water and water and has
[1:19:10] made us unto god and unto god water
[1:19:14] and welcome we become leader melchizedek
[1:19:20] because melchizedek was a priest and a
[1:19:23] king
[1:19:24] so we become melchizedek who was at the
[1:19:28] beginning
[1:19:29] because melchizedek became jesus christ
[1:19:32] but at the beginning he was the word
[1:19:35] logos
[1:19:36] the theophany that have no beginning no
[1:19:39] ending
[1:19:40] everybody clear so out of every chunk
[1:19:43] every tribe every kindred god is pulling
[1:19:46] his children ever care but if you notice
[1:19:49] on verse eight the bible says that when
[1:19:52] he take he had taken the book
[1:19:55] the four beasts and the four and twenty
[1:19:58] elder fell down before the lamb
[1:20:01] having every one of them harp and golden
[1:20:04] vowel full of others which are the
[1:20:07] prayers of the center and they who are
[1:20:09] they
[1:20:11] who are they
[1:20:13] the four beasts and who
[1:20:16] why are the four beasts and the 24 out
[1:20:19] there singing the song of redemption
[1:20:23] the four beasts
[1:20:24] ever clear
[1:20:26] are the four anointings
[1:20:28] we already know that
[1:20:30] everybody clear the first one is who
[1:20:34] the second one
[1:20:35] the third one
[1:20:37] and the fourth one is who
[1:20:39] a flying ego everybody clear then we
[1:20:42] have 24 elders
[1:20:44] and the 24 hours we know that 12 of them
[1:20:47] are who
[1:20:49] the patriarch
[1:20:50] elbakir
[1:20:52] and the other 12 are who
[1:20:56] the apostles
[1:20:57] anybody clear
[1:20:59] if you go back in the garden of eden
[1:21:03] you okay
[1:21:04] keep your seat belt i'm maneuvering
[1:21:06] there is an asteroid
[1:21:08] so when i move the plane like this just
[1:21:10] understand i'm trying to dodge an
[1:21:12] asteroid everybody clear so when you go
[1:21:15] back in the book of genesis
[1:21:17] in the garden of eden
[1:21:20] we had the tree of life
[1:21:22] everybody
[1:21:24] and that tree of life was who
[1:21:27] everybody clear
[1:21:28] when men fell and sinned
[1:21:31] god brought the caribbeans
[1:21:35] anybody clear and the kerry beams came
[1:21:37] around and broke the entrance to the
[1:21:40] tree of life so from the very beginning
[1:21:44] in eden
[1:21:45] we found out that the throne of god was
[1:21:48] there
[1:21:49] and the kerry beams all the four beasts
[1:21:51] were there as well
[1:21:53] anybody clear so far
[1:21:55] then when we begin to move on
[1:21:58] you okay i'm talking about the tribes
[1:22:01] the apostles and the four anointing
[1:22:04] in the old testament
[1:22:07] in genesis christ was there in the
[1:22:09] garden of eden and the four beasts were
[1:22:12] there
[1:22:13] when jacob came down the road
[1:22:16] jacob brought the twelve
[1:22:19] patriarch
[1:22:20] everybody here
[1:22:22] you clear
[1:22:23] then when moses came
[1:22:26] moses brought the patriarch out of the
[1:22:28] land of egypt
[1:22:30] and as they were traveling through the
[1:22:32] wilderness
[1:22:33] moses put those tribes in a certain
[1:22:37] order three tribes on the east three
[1:22:40] tribes on the west three tribes on the
[1:22:43] north and three tribes on the south and
[1:22:46] there were four corners with twelve
[1:22:48] tribes everybody clear in other words
[1:22:51] moses took the number 4 and number 12
[1:22:54] and put it together
[1:22:58] moses took the beast
[1:23:00] everybody clear and the 12th patriarch
[1:23:04] and put them together
[1:23:06] ever here
[1:23:08] that's why brother branham says that
[1:23:11] israel have seven church ages
[1:23:16] and barbeque
[1:23:17] ever clear so far so when we come in the
[1:23:20] new testament we found jesus christ came
[1:23:24] down and started at the beginning of the
[1:23:27] new testament
[1:23:31] here so in the new testament
[1:23:34] we also found christ there
[1:23:37] but christ is surrendered by four gospel
[1:23:43] in the old testament christ was
[1:23:46] surrendered by four beasts
[1:23:48] in the new testament at the beginning
[1:23:50] christ is surrendered by the forebear
[1:23:53] for gospel and brother branham said
[1:23:56] matthew was delighted
[1:23:58] he said mark was the ox he said look the
[1:24:01] doctor was there a man
[1:24:04] and john who was a prophet was a flying
[1:24:06] ego
[1:24:07] ever clear and just after christ came
[1:24:11] the twelve patriarchy and when jesus
[1:24:14] christ also came he brought the 12th
[1:24:17] apostle
[1:24:20] everybody clear so far
[1:24:22] and after the 12th apostle when we get
[1:24:25] to the seventh church jesus john pick up
[1:24:29] the four beasts
[1:24:30] and combined them with their apostle
[1:24:34] because the church is built upon the
[1:24:36] foundation of hope
[1:24:40] and jesus christ himself being the chief
[1:24:42] water
[1:24:43] everybody clear so you can see from
[1:24:46] genesis
[1:24:47] all the way to revelation you have the
[1:24:50] four anointing
[1:24:51] you have the patriarch and you have the
[1:24:54] apostle everybody clear and when you go
[1:24:56] to the new jerusalem
[1:24:58] you're going to find all of this part
[1:25:00] together
[1:25:04] everybody so far
[1:25:06] i'm deviating and not showing you there
[1:25:08] in revelation 21 the bible says and
[1:25:12] there came unto me one of the seven
[1:25:14] angels which had the seven vows you know
[1:25:17] him full of the seven last flag and talk
[1:25:20] with me we know his brother branham
[1:25:22] saying come here i will surely the bride
[1:25:25] the lambs who
[1:25:28] you thought he was a woman
[1:25:30] and he carried me away in the spirit to
[1:25:32] a great and high mountain and show me a
[1:25:34] water
[1:25:36] that bread is water
[1:25:39] the holy jerusalem descending out of
[1:25:42] heaven from who
[1:25:44] verse 12 and he had and had a wall great
[1:25:48] and high and had how many gates
[1:25:51] and at the gate to have water
[1:25:55] and the name written thereof without the
[1:25:57] which are the name of who
[1:26:02] the patriarch everybody here
[1:26:04] verse 14 on the same city and the fall
[1:26:08] and the walls of the city have how many
[1:26:11] 12 foundations and in them the name of
[1:26:14] who
[1:26:15] everybody here so far
[1:26:17] and in revelation 22 verse 1 and he
[1:26:20] showed me a pure river of water clear
[1:26:23] crystal proceeding out of the throne of
[1:26:25] what
[1:26:26] so the new jerusalem have the throne of
[1:26:29] god
[1:26:30] which is surrendered by the four
[1:26:32] caribbeans and he also have the twelve
[1:26:34] apostles and he also have the twelve
[1:26:36] child put it together ever clear so when
[1:26:39] you talk about redemption for human
[1:26:42] being you always work with number four
[1:26:44] and number twelve
[1:26:46] those numbers work together and continue
[1:26:48] to move all around
[1:26:50] from genesis all the way to revelation
[1:26:53] everybody cleared so far
[1:26:55] i hope i didn't lose somebody
[1:26:57] everybody cleared so far
[1:26:59] yeah we just
[1:27:00] dodged it
[1:27:01] everybody clear so far blessed be the
[1:27:03] name of the lord now in jude chapter
[1:27:06] verse 6
[1:27:08] the bible says that the angels which
[1:27:11] kept not their first listen their first
[1:27:13] position
[1:27:14] but left their own habitation and he had
[1:27:17] reserved into everlasting chain under
[1:27:21] darkness unto the judgment of the great
[1:27:23] day in other words these angels
[1:27:26] had a position just like horror had a
[1:27:29] position but at a certain time they lost
[1:27:32] their position and when they lost their
[1:27:34] position god took them and put them in
[1:27:37] chain or into a prison and we know that
[1:27:40] prison was hell
[1:27:42] [Music]
[1:27:44] but when we looked at hell
[1:27:47] the bible says this
[1:27:49] the bible says that
[1:27:51] then he shall say also unto them that
[1:27:54] are under
[1:27:56] those human beings remember on wednesday

[1:28:08] how can a human being get in a place
[1:28:11] that is prepared from the devil and his
[1:28:13] angel
[1:28:15] we found out on wednesday
[1:28:17] when we speak about the word angel on
[1:28:20] wednesday angel means what

[1:28:44] uh today if we can get into it your
[1:28:47] clicker is acting up but we're gonna get
[1:28:49] there praise be the name of the lord
[1:28:52] okay
[1:28:53] brother bonham says
[1:28:55] that this great
[1:28:57] first battle that was ever thought
[1:29:00] beginning in water
[1:29:02] when michael and his angel fought
[1:29:05] against lucifer and his angel the bible
[1:29:08] just said that hell
[1:29:10] was created for the devil and his angel
[1:29:15] ever clear so when we say the devil
[1:29:20] the devil and his angel he means
[1:29:24] something
[1:29:26] amen
[1:29:27] what about him say when michael and his
[1:29:30] angel fought against lucifer and who his
[1:29:34] angel
[1:29:35] it first started
[1:29:37] the first body was in heaven
[1:29:39] so sin
[1:29:40] did not originate on earth
[1:29:44] he originated in water
[1:29:47] so whatever happened on earth here is
[1:29:50] only a reflection
[1:29:53] of the star war
[1:30:01] do you think they put up that movie by
[1:30:03] any chance
[1:30:04] they understood certain things better
[1:30:06] than you
[1:30:08] because the children of darkness are
[1:30:10] wiser than the children of light
[1:30:13] ever here
[1:30:14] the true star war
[1:30:16] speak about the true origin
[1:30:20] ever clear
[1:30:22] ever clear so far
[1:30:23] and then after this battle happened then
[1:30:27] he was thrown down from heaven cast out
[1:30:30] of heaven to the water
[1:30:32] and fell on water so before something
[1:30:35] happened in the nature it must happen
[1:30:38] into another dimension amen before esau
[1:30:43] and jacob fight in the belly of the
[1:30:46] mother remember on wednesday they have
[1:30:48] to fight from somewhere
[1:30:53] everybody created so far
[1:30:54] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:30:57] hallelujah
[1:30:59] let me see
[1:31:03] i wish that computer can come to the
[1:31:05] front but that's fine in revelation 12
[1:31:08] the bible says there was war in heaven
[1:31:12] michael and water
[1:31:14] his angel fought against the dragon and
[1:31:17] the dragon fought with his water
[1:31:20] to kingdom and prevailed not
[1:31:23] neither was there
[1:31:25] their position found anymore in water so
[1:31:28] they had a position before
[1:31:30] but they lost their position
[1:31:33] and the great dragon was cast out
[1:31:36] that old serpent called the devil and
[1:31:38] satan which deceived the whole world he
[1:31:42] was cast out into the water
[1:31:44] and his angels were cast out with him so
[1:31:48] lucifer never came down himself
[1:31:51] he came down with his company cola was
[1:31:55] never destroyed himself
[1:31:57] cola went down with his company
[1:32:00] ever clear so far
[1:32:02] so in short from there that election
[1:32:06] doesn't really start here
[1:32:08] elections start way up there
[1:32:11] into the star
[1:32:13] the bible says forsake a church thee
[1:32:16] before god and the lord jesus christ and
[1:32:19] the water
[1:32:20] so they are certain angel they were
[1:32:23] elected and some of them were not
[1:32:25] elected whoever was elected stood with
[1:32:29] michael and michael was crashed and
[1:32:32] whoever was not elected stood with the
[1:32:35] devil
[1:32:37] depending on their origin
[1:32:41] everybody clear so far
[1:32:43] blessed be the name of the lord so you
[1:32:45] started from somewhere else
[1:32:48] here
[1:32:49] what you are brother branham say i said
[1:32:52] it in the beginning what you are
[1:32:55] somewhere else is what you reflect here
[1:33:01] remember on wednesday the baby when he's
[1:33:03] in the belly
[1:33:05] he's not there it's just the muscles
[1:33:07] that are moving
[1:33:09] but in the pregnancy of rebecca the
[1:33:12] muscles were punching each other
[1:33:14] [Music]
[1:33:15] but if you look there
[1:33:17] the individuals are not there
[1:33:19] they are somewhere else
[1:33:21] so where was the fight
[1:33:26] what you are
[1:33:28] watch your water
[1:33:30] oh terrace your body is up yonder
[1:33:33] watch your celestial body somewhere else
[1:33:36] is what you are reflecting back here
[1:33:39] in the spirit land what you are is what
[1:33:42] you are here
[1:33:44] if you are still full commanded and so
[1:33:47] forth in the spirit land you are
[1:33:49] vulgar-minded here if you still got
[1:33:52] malice envy and strife you are in the
[1:33:55] spirit land with that you reflect back
[1:33:58] here but if your whole innermost being
[1:34:01] has become cleansed and purge it shows
[1:34:04] that you got a body out beyond
[1:34:07] wedding that has been cleansed and
[1:34:10] purged and it's reacting back into water
[1:34:14] so the fight between eso and jacob was
[1:34:17] not really a natural fight it was a
[1:34:20] fight that started somewhere
[1:34:23] into a different realm
[1:34:25] ever clear so far
[1:34:26] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:34:29] don't know if i need a battery
[1:34:31] brother if you got triple a you can let
[1:34:33] me know
[1:34:34] i have it in my bag
[1:34:36] but i didn't think this is going to act
[1:34:38] like this
[1:34:40] amen
[1:34:42] blessed be the name of the lord the blah
[1:34:44] blah
[1:34:47] he said paul was holding up there saying
[1:34:51] about the water the election of god said
[1:34:54] that he saw and jacob before either baby
[1:34:58] was born or anything god said that he
[1:35:01] knew them and he hated esau and loved
[1:35:04] her
[1:35:06] before either boy had the chance to
[1:35:08] express their gadget
[1:35:10] for he was god
[1:35:13] he is infinite
[1:35:14] and he if he is infinite he knowed every
[1:35:17] flea every fly every knot everything
[1:35:20] that ever be on the earth he knew it
[1:35:23] he's the infinite eternal immortal
[1:35:26] blessed god omnipotent
[1:35:28] you there
[1:35:29] on me present omnipresent you there and
[1:35:32] water
[1:35:34] remember that omission
[1:35:36] it's what makes god own me present you
[1:35:38] remember there is nothing that he
[1:35:41] doesn't know
[1:35:43] that is the reason he can tell what the
[1:35:46] end will be
[1:35:48] so the omniscient power of god
[1:35:51] give god the prophetic power
[1:35:56] because god knows everything
[1:35:59] god is able to prophesy
[1:36:02] it is the omniscient or the knowledge of
[1:36:06] god that give god the prophetic power
[1:36:11] everybody here he knows the end from the
[1:36:14] beginning
[1:36:15] what is prophetic is just his water
[1:36:19] he is the chief attorney
[1:36:22] he is the judge he just picked the
[1:36:25] lawyer some of his wisdom that is what
[1:36:28] prophecy is that can foretell because he
[1:36:31] knows what he's going to be now there is
[1:36:33] god that we serve in other words the
[1:36:36] omniscient power of god makes god a
[1:36:39] prophet
[1:36:40] god can prophesy because he knows
[1:36:43] everything
[1:36:44] about here but before these two children
[1:36:47] were born
[1:36:48] before they were even formed in the
[1:36:51] mother womb god spoke
[1:36:54] god saw them where did god see them
[1:36:58] anybody clear so far
[1:37:00] now let's go to genesis chapter 25 now
[1:37:04] as we're getting into this
[1:37:06] we're going to pull esau and jacob
[1:37:10] amen
[1:37:12] verse 20. this is where we were on
[1:37:14] wednesday
[1:37:16] the bible says and isaac was 40 years
[1:37:20] why 40.
[1:37:22] 40 years old when he took rebecca as his
[1:37:26] as a wife the daughter of beethoven the
[1:37:29] syrian of pentanom the sister of laban
[1:37:32] the syrian everybody clear
[1:37:34] and isaac treated the lord for his wife
[1:37:37] because she was barren and the lord was
[1:37:40] intrigued of him and rebecca his wife
[1:37:42] did water
[1:37:44] we know rebecca conceived by one
[1:37:46] remember on wednesday the serpent said
[1:37:48] not by two everybody clear so this story
[1:37:51] move us from the earth
[1:37:53] back to heaven everybody clear
[1:37:56] verse 22 and the children struggle
[1:37:59] together
[1:38:00] inside of her the muscles
[1:38:03] and she said
[1:38:04] if it be so why am i does
[1:38:07] and she went to inquire of the lord
[1:38:12] who went to
[1:38:14] god was isaac there
[1:38:20] keep your seat belt
[1:38:24] who went to god again
[1:38:27] rebecca went to god the bible is not
[1:38:31] speaking anything about isaac
[1:38:34] to ask about the fight
[1:38:37] i am one field
[1:38:39] i have
[1:38:40] it seems like i have twins
[1:38:42] in my field
[1:38:44] but for some reason they're not quiet
[1:38:48] they are fighting
[1:38:50] one is always fighting against the other
[1:38:54] are they from the same source or not
[1:38:59] are we there
[1:39:00] so god
[1:39:01] you the one that gave me this pregnancy
[1:39:05] who gave the children
[1:39:09] anybody clear because she was barren so
[1:39:11] if god gave me the children i'm going to
[1:39:14] go back to god to ask him why is my
[1:39:17] child behaving the way he behaves
[1:39:23] everybody here
[1:39:25] so when she went back to god
[1:39:27] god now
[1:39:29] broke the seal
[1:39:31] what is god saying
[1:39:33] if you can give me a minute let me see
[1:39:35] if that's gonna help here
[1:39:48] the devil knows why he's upset
[1:39:52] i know exactly what is in this slide
[1:39:56] and i know what he's going to do to him
[1:39:58] thank you brother caleb
[1:40:02] okay
[1:40:04] let's see
[1:40:05] if this is going to work
[1:40:07] okay wow i wish i had this quicker
[1:40:14] let me get him now
[1:40:17] amen
[1:40:18] so she went to god and inquired of god
[1:40:21] now god is giving the explanation verse
[1:40:24] 22 23 and the lord said to her how many
[1:40:28] nations are there
[1:40:30] two nations are in your womb
[1:40:32] and two manners of people shall be
[1:40:34] separated from the obama
[1:40:37] and the one people shall be stronger
[1:40:40] than the other people
[1:40:42] usually when we say one people shall be
[1:40:44] stronger than the other who do you think
[1:40:46] we give that strength to
[1:40:51] is so right
[1:40:54] so normally we say esau was the
[1:40:56] strongest
[1:40:57] one day
[1:40:59] jacob fight he fought with god
[1:41:04] [Music]
[1:41:07] and jacob behold god he held god all the
[1:41:11] way till the morning
[1:41:13] and god was not able to even leave jacob
[1:41:18] anybody here
[1:41:19] until
[1:41:20] god have to destabilize about i mean
[1:41:23] jacob to kind of quiet him down
[1:41:26] everybody
[1:41:28] and then he changed the name of jacob
[1:41:30] from jacob to israel
[1:41:32] because jacob of the kem god that's
[1:41:35] right
[1:41:36] everybody here so who was the stronger
[1:41:39] one
[1:41:44] you need a scripture go to the book of
[1:41:46] hosea
[1:41:48] so jacob
[1:41:49] was the stronger one
[1:41:52] you need the scripture see me
[1:41:54] you okay now
[1:41:56] okay let's go back
[1:41:58] so the the younger uh the one people
[1:42:01] shall be stronger than the other people
[1:42:05] and the elder shall serve the who
[1:42:09] normally the younger is the one who's
[1:42:11] gonna serve there
[1:42:14] by birth
[1:42:17] by birth
[1:42:19] by nature
[1:42:21] by
[1:42:22] this world
[1:42:23] the one that came first was esau
[1:42:28] everybody here
[1:42:31] now in the mind of god
[1:42:34] god was eternal
[1:42:38] god never had a beginning
[1:42:40] god never had an end
[1:42:42] everything that was in god or his
[1:42:45] attribute we demonstrated to you that
[1:42:47] they were what
[1:42:49] eternal everybody clear so we always
[1:42:52] existed in the mind of god
[1:42:55] it is the kingdom of the devil and the
[1:42:58] children of the devil that had a
[1:43:00] beginning and the end
[1:43:03] so who was really the true elder
[1:43:11] who always existed in the mind of god
[1:43:14] was he jacob or esau
[1:43:21] jacob
[1:43:23] was the elder
[1:43:25] in the star
[1:43:28] we okay now is everybody okay i'm going
[1:43:30] slowly i know i'm dodging that steroid
[1:43:34] in the star everybody clear
[1:43:36] hey
[1:43:37] but naturally speaking
[1:43:39] the elder
[1:43:41] is who
[1:43:42] is esau
[1:43:44] anybody here
[1:43:46] so now you understand when jacob was
[1:43:49] fighting
[1:43:51] you okay now
[1:43:53] he understood that his son was pulling
[1:43:55] his position
[1:43:57] that's why jacob was fighting he was
[1:44:00] fighting and fighting ever here he was
[1:44:03] fighting trying to hold his position
[1:44:06] everybody here
[1:44:08] usually
[1:44:09] when twins are born
[1:44:12] one will be born first
[1:44:14] and it's gonna take a while
[1:44:17] before the second one is born here but
[1:44:21] in jacob and issa as soon as israel is
[1:44:24] coming out they found jacob is holding
[1:44:28] his anchor and keep going
[1:44:31] everybody here
[1:44:38] you can't go out there i am the one who
[1:44:41] hold the position
[1:44:44] everybody here
[1:44:46] they behave behavior of jacob
[1:44:50] was interpreted
[1:44:52] by the people of the world
[1:44:54] as a deceiver
[1:44:58] amen jacob
[1:44:59] was judged
[1:45:03] by
[1:45:04] the people
[1:45:05] that he is a bad character
[1:45:07] [Music]
[1:45:11] anybody clear
[1:45:12] they saw him that he's a fighter
[1:45:15] he's a man that doesn't have respect
[1:45:19] nature saw him as a deceiver
[1:45:23] everybody here
[1:45:24] the only
[1:45:25] one that knew the truth
[1:45:28] about jacob
[1:45:30] was only rebecca
[1:45:36] everybody understanding
[1:45:38] so when you look at jacob you're going
[1:45:40] to judge him bad
[1:45:42] you're going to judge him by his
[1:45:44] behavior and nobody understood why jacob
[1:45:48] always was unsatisfied to be the
[1:45:51] youngest
[1:45:52] [Music]
[1:45:54] come on you follow me
[1:45:56] until he was seeking for every
[1:45:58] opportunity that he can gain his
[1:46:01] position back
[1:46:04] and when he found out that his soul came
[1:46:06] from the field and esau was tired
[1:46:10] and eso begin to ask him something jacob
[1:46:13] turned around and said yes before i give
[1:46:15] it to you
[1:46:16] give me the birthright
[1:46:19] what was in this boy
[1:46:22] that he loved the birthright so much
[1:46:30] what was in this boy that he always
[1:46:33] wanna be first
[1:46:42] let's go now to the scripture verse 24
[1:46:45] and when the days to be delivered
[1:46:48] where fulfilled behold they were what
[1:46:51] twins needed naturally speaking
[1:46:54] by two twins here by one
[1:46:57] anybody here
[1:46:59] in the womb
[1:47:01] now they first came out how
[1:47:05] red
[1:47:06] all over like water
[1:47:10] when iso came
[1:47:12] iso came like a hairy garment
[1:47:17] anybody care
[1:47:19] so when you look at each song
[1:47:21] human beings are not born
[1:47:24] we fell out of here
[1:47:29] i'm going slowly everybody here
[1:47:33] what
[1:47:35] comes out with hair
[1:47:37] all over from the womb is usually animal
[1:47:45] are we okay
[1:47:47] until
[1:47:49] to deceive isaac
[1:47:51] they have to get a good skin
[1:47:55] have you seen a god
[1:47:57] have you skinned the goat of the
[1:47:59] skin of a god
[1:48:00] you have to get that too much esau
[1:48:07] ever here am i reading a different bible
[1:48:10] so when you take a goat
[1:48:12] and if you sleeping on your bed and
[1:48:15] somebody bring a goat and you touch him
[1:48:17] and they move the god and they bring
[1:48:19] israel you touch him you won't make any
[1:48:21] difference
[1:48:25] am i reading a different bible
[1:48:27] so each soul display a beastly nature
[1:48:36] everybody here so far
[1:48:37] anybody can
[1:48:38] everybody clear so far and they're
[1:48:40] calling me so verse 26
[1:48:43] and after that came his brother out and
[1:48:46] his hand took a hold of israel's heel
[1:48:48] and his name was called jacob and isaac
[1:48:52] was harmony
[1:48:53] to score his water
[1:48:56] 16. he was 40 when he got married
[1:49:00] and he got his children when he was 60.
[1:49:02] the difference is how many years
[1:49:05] 20 years so then they lived
[1:49:07] 20 years without any problem
[1:49:10] until he so came
[1:49:12] because pentecost was in 33
[1:49:15] and the church of ephesus started in 53
[1:49:18] and 33 man is 53 it's 20 years of pure
[1:49:21] church before the denominational spirit
[1:49:24] was introduced
[1:49:27] everybody clear so far
[1:49:28] did that lose anybody
[1:49:31] did i lose anybody can i start it again
[1:49:35] can i start again
[1:49:38] esau was 40 years
[1:49:40] he lived 40 years with rebecca without
[1:49:43] any problem
[1:49:44] because
[1:49:45] i mean uh isaac was 40 years he lived 20
[1:49:49] years with rebecca without any problem
[1:49:52] there was no wrong seed in the camp of
[1:49:54] isaac after 20 years a wrong seed is
[1:49:58] born by esau
[1:50:00] and in the day of pentecost the holy
[1:50:02] ghost came in 33 after jesus christ
[1:50:06] and brother branham said the ephesian
[1:50:08] church started in 1953 so it took 20
[1:50:12] years without the church was quiet
[1:50:15] without any problem and in 53 the
[1:50:18] nicolet and spirit begin to operate
[1:50:20] within the churches
[1:50:24] okay now
[1:50:25] i'm using a different caliber sorry
[1:50:28] everybody clear
[1:50:30] ever here
[1:50:31] are you twenty three score years old
[1:50:33] when she was born when she bought them
[1:50:35] everybody clear
[1:50:37] job now in verse 27 and the boys grew
[1:50:40] and he saw was the water
[1:50:44] like nimble road
[1:50:46] [Music]
[1:50:48] you okay now
[1:50:49] okay
[1:50:50] county hunters like nimrod a man of the
[1:50:53] water a man of the world

[2:02:50] isaac can tell that this is not jesus
[2:02:54] he can tell that this is jacob this is
[2:02:56] his soul because his love is based on

[2:03:35] turned the light off
[2:03:39] and in his seer and so forth absolutely
[2:03:42] knows that these things as god will
[2:03:45] reveal it
[2:03:47] there is many things he don't reveal to
[2:03:50] his water
[2:03:52] so god
[2:03:53] not only dem isaac he turned off his
[2:03:56] prophetic office
[2:04:06] he is god
[2:04:08] he can do whatever he wants

[2:04:29] didn't know the difference for 40 years
[2:04:33] they lied to jacob
[2:04:35] joseph was killed
[2:04:37] the prophetic office was turned off

[2:15:50] [Music]
[2:15:51] now it's clear right now it's okay
[2:15:54] because somebody might be struggling
[2:15:57] it is not isaac giving the blessing
[2:16:00] amen
[2:16:02] he knew the whole story for the
[2:16:04] beginning
[2:16:07] he could have turned and say jacob
[2:16:09] struck dead
[2:16:12] but instead he's turning his prophet off
[2:16:17] are you there and he discerned him not
[2:16:20] because his hand were water he rely on
[2:16:23] the five cents to keep relying on the
[2:16:25] five senses
[2:16:26] you don't have the revelation
[2:16:29] and as his brother he shows hand so he
[2:16:31] did water
[2:16:34] how did you bless him
[2:16:36] verse 27
[2:16:38] are you there
[2:16:42] hallelujah no job to verse 29 i'm going
[2:16:44] to skip let
[2:16:46] people do water

[2:16:59] curse be everyone that you want
[2:17:02] and blessed be
[2:17:04] he that dewater
[2:17:06] the blessing of abraham
[2:17:08] through the cross
[2:17:10] is transferred from the first son
[2:17:13] the jew
[2:17:15] naturally speaking and it's going toward
[2:17:17] the gender
[2:17:19] by the crossing of the hand
[2:17:20] [Applause]
[2:17:25] are you there
[2:17:26] are you there bring the two son the
[2:17:28] elder is here the youngest is here jacob

[2:17:45] are you there
[2:17:47] so god turn this discernment off
[2:17:51] because jacob didn't have a chance
[2:17:54] but jacob was the one rightfully the one
[2:17:57] who should get it
[2:17:59] where are we going to
[2:18:01] my god
[2:18:04] my god
[2:18:05] amen
[2:18:06] our eternal destination
[2:18:08] is not altogether determined by what we
[2:18:12] see
[2:18:12] which
[2:18:14] senses did they turn off
[2:18:16] and what we do what
[2:18:18] which senses did they turn off
[2:18:21] why god touches those two
[2:18:23] the other one no problem
[2:18:26] but it's determined on what what
[2:18:30] do you see what god was turning them off
[2:18:33] what we have we have of what we see and
[2:18:36] what we the message is perfectly in line
[2:18:40] with the scripture
[2:18:42] everybody
[2:18:44] why
[2:18:45] what shall we say then
[2:18:47] that the gender which follow not after
[2:18:50] righteousness have attend to
[2:18:53] righteousness even the righteousness
[2:18:55] which is of water
[2:18:57] based on revelation
[2:18:59] jacob unqualified
[2:19:01] jacob got the blessing
[2:19:04] and he who worked hard
[2:19:07] lost the blessing
[2:19:09] what can we say then amen
[2:19:12] but israel which follow after the water
[2:19:17] has not attended
[2:19:20] wherefore because they sought it not by
[2:19:24] water

[2:24:37] the story
[2:24:39] that he

[2:25:40] neither because they are the seed of
[2:25:42] abraham
[2:25:44] are they all water
[2:25:46] in other words not all stars are
[2:25:49] children of god
[2:25:56] don't go watch it
[2:26:00] are you there
[2:26:02] but in who
[2:26:04] shall deceiver
[2:26:06] they which are the children of the
[2:26:10] these are not the children of god but
[2:26:12] the children of them
[2:26:14] are accounted for
[2:26:16] and that promise was
[2:26:18] christ
[2:26:21] hallelujah
[2:26:25] your clicker is taking my second
[2:26:28] so the stars of heaven
[2:26:30] represented the spirit of who
[2:26:35] we okay now
[2:26:36] we okay now
[2:26:38] watch now as we drop it
[2:26:40] when the red dragon roam under
[2:26:43] persecution i get turned off the star
[2:26:46] every scripture has a compound meaning
[2:26:49] but the obama is going up down he begin
[2:26:51] to show you from noah in the time of
[2:26:53] jesus
[2:26:54] the story keeps repeating
[2:26:57] so all over
[2:26:58] satan is keep pulling his stars and god
[2:27:01] is pulling also his stars all over the
[2:27:04] story is repeating
[2:27:05] everybody is pulling their own children
[2:27:08] every age the children of god the
[2:27:10] children of the devil the children of
[2:27:11] god the children of the devil
[2:27:13] here
[2:27:14] at the crucifixion of our lord jesus
[2:27:17] when they rejected him cast him down and
[2:27:19] had nothing to do there was the third
[2:27:22] part of the angelic
[2:27:24] the angelic
[2:27:26] so they were a human being
[2:27:29] brother branham now is showing here that
[2:27:32] when the jews were rejecting christ on
[2:27:35] the earth
[2:27:36] it is nothing but a
[2:27:39] manifestation of what already happened a
[2:27:42] long time
[2:27:49] hallelujah
[2:27:51] inside of you is a spirit
[2:27:53] another man the outside of you is one
[2:27:56] man the inside of you is another man so
[2:27:59] the inside of you is the supernatural
[2:28:01] the spirit the angel the outside of you
[2:28:04] is the physical and this being if you
[2:28:07] are spirit led by god you become a
[2:28:09] messenger of god
[2:28:11] or an angel god's messenger god's angel
[2:28:14] is the very same word can separate it
[2:28:16] god's messenger or god's water
[2:28:19] so we found out that what happened in
[2:28:21] the natural is nothing else but a
[2:28:24] reflection of something that happened
[2:28:26] way up there
[2:28:29] ever clear
[2:28:30] hallelujah
[2:28:32] what is going on
[2:28:33] the souls that were in prison
[2:28:36] that repented not were not angelic
[2:28:40] beings that had been brought down in the
[2:28:42] form of angel
[2:28:44] angels
[2:28:46] means human being
[2:28:48] means theophany means angel brother
[2:28:51] branham said it is not the angels
[2:28:53] like gabriel and uh and wormwood that's
[2:28:56] not it
[2:28:58] that's not those angels
[2:28:59] those angels are not what we're talking
[2:29:01] about here that's what brother branham
[2:29:03] is he's saying here but he was the
[2:29:06] spirit of those angelic water they are
[2:29:08] human beings that fell
[2:29:11] before
[2:29:13] the foundation of the water
[2:29:15] back there one day
[2:29:18] went on water
[2:29:19] your star war
[2:29:24] everybody here

[2:29:32] angel
[2:29:34] his children
[2:29:36] all of them
[2:29:38] you understand now
[2:29:40] remember matthew 13
[2:29:41] the tales and the witter
[2:29:44] the children that he deceived
[2:29:47] he had deceived and those angels came
[2:29:50] down to the earth and was subject to
[2:29:52] them to become water
[2:29:54] and when they did it the sons of god
[2:29:57] they used to be saw the daughter of
[2:29:59] water
[2:30:02] they were the children of the devil
[2:30:06] you okay
[2:30:07] so the devil was cast down watch this
[2:30:10] before i go

[2:30:27] born in this earth is a son of god
[2:30:29] regardless whether he's a sinner or he's
[2:30:31] or what is he or what he is he is the
[2:30:33] son of god created in the image of god
[2:30:36] for god for the praise of god he's
[2:30:38] created that way but god in the
[2:30:41] beginning knew would receive him
[2:30:44] and who would not receive him
[2:30:46] therefore he could do whatever
[2:30:49] or not
[2:30:53] we okay now
[2:30:54] but by four knowledge he could tell who
[2:30:58] will be what
[2:30:59] and who will not be what
[2:31:01] for he knew which person would take up
[2:31:03] witches
[2:31:05] and those spirit that came from the
[2:31:07] throne of god
[2:31:09] and stand before the throne of god
[2:31:12] billions and billions
[2:31:14] alien of time before the world ever
[2:31:16] begin in the presence of god do you
[2:31:19] think they don't know something about
[2:31:21] worship

[2:31:24] korah can serve god a certain time
[2:31:28] and after time he's gonna fall
[2:31:31] that's why judah can serve a certain
[2:31:33] time and after a while he's gonna fall
[2:31:36] because in heaven they serve a certain
[2:31:38] time and after that time they fell it is

[2:31:54] have the knowledge of god they are
[2:31:57] ensured and educated always but god
[2:32:00] rejected them from the water
[2:32:02] that's why god said i hated esau
[2:32:07] because god saw what is so deed in
[2:32:09] heaven
[2:32:11] before he saw us

[2:32:35] because he rebelled against god are you
[2:32:38] there he created war
[2:32:40] and the people recruit around him just
[2:32:44] like the people recruit around korra

[2:33:28] belongs to the devil and god took all of
[2:33:30] them pulled all of them together and
[2:33:33] brought them all into hell

[2:33:40] he took all of them into hell
[2:33:43] are you there
[2:33:44] all of them god pulled them into hell
[2:33:46] now this is not the this is not in the
[2:33:50] world this is before the foundation of
[2:33:52] the world
[2:33:53] ever here that's the true star war
[2:33:56] when they were overcome god sent them
[2:33:59] into a prison
[2:34:00] and now when they were into a prison now
[2:34:04] all of them became a resident of hell
[2:34:08] you okay
[2:34:09] and they become sons of water
[2:34:15] at the beginning they were sons of god
[2:34:18] [Music]
[2:34:20] are you there
[2:34:22] now when a woman is pregnant
[2:34:27] not
[2:34:28] you are you there
[2:34:31] depending on what god want to do
[2:34:35] he pulled one up
[2:34:37] if it's twins
[2:34:39] he put it and he pulled one from down
[2:34:44] and he put it
[2:34:46] so when he saw and jacob found himself
[2:34:50] navigating around rebecca the fight
[2:34:53] started
[2:34:53] [Music]
[2:34:56] now the children begin to fight rebecca
[2:34:59] doesn't understand no the two spirits
[2:35:01] are going in one womb now they begin to
[2:35:03] fight one is coming from a different
[2:35:06] origin that's why jesus taught the
[2:35:08] pharisee you are from
[2:35:12] you are from beneath
[2:35:14] i came from water
[2:35:22] are you there
[2:35:23] because judah was a son of water when he
[2:35:26] was coming god look he said no jesus is
[2:35:29] coming okay jesus who is his match judah
[2:35:33] judah
[2:35:34] he pull him come get in here and mama
[2:35:38] got to judah
[2:35:42] are you there
[2:35:44] if that's why he came a son of water
[2:35:46] he's coming from down
[2:35:48] here
[2:35:52] so not only is the
[2:35:55] those angels fell
[2:35:57] the third of the other angel also fell
[2:35:59] together
[2:36:00] everybody
[2:36:01] so now they change from true angel they
[2:36:03] become demona
[2:36:05] they were not demons before
[2:36:07] amen
[2:36:08] when they become demon god precipitated
[2:36:10] them all over there
[2:36:12] they become children of what rough
[2:36:16] everybody
[2:36:17] and then everyone that is represented in
[2:36:21] hell his destination will be destroyed
[2:36:24] at the lake of fire
[2:36:28] because all of them were not eternal

[2:37:25] you rejected the devil when you were in
[2:37:28] heaven
[2:37:34] are you there
[2:37:36] that's why sometimes you don't
[2:37:37] understand but something and you say
[2:37:40] i don't believe him i don't believe him
[2:37:42] i don't believe him because you already
[2:37:45] rejected him over there
[2:37:47] [Applause]

[2:37:52] had to take a body of flesh to take his

[2:38:00] to flesh like the other did and all of

[2:39:23] things for us we could not put trust in
[2:39:26] him

[2:44:10] him but truly he doesn't even need that
[2:44:13] school
[2:44:14] he was already in him
[2:44:16] that's why paul said one star
[2:44:19] died fair from another star in water
[2:44:22] in glory
[2:44:24] because when we were coming god was
[2:44:26] looking god wanted to be a carpenter

[2:45:08] brother kalima was pushed toward medical
[2:45:11] school

[2:45:17] because god had something else for him
[2:45:20] and once you find your position you're
[2:45:23] gonna feel like you don't work too hard
[2:45:25] anymore
[2:45:27] [Applause]
[2:45:34] you will see some people going to work
[2:45:37] upset some are ready to go to work they
[2:45:40] even ready to go to their job
[2:45:42] they spend even more time in their job
[2:45:44] than their work that was what they
[2:45:46] created him for
