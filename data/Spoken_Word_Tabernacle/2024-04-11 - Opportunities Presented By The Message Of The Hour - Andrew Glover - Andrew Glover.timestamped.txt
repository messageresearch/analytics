[32:42] blasting the devil tonight amen
[32:54] amen um I'd like to give a quick
[32:56] testimony before I sing the song Just
[32:58] because I feel like the words preface
[33:01] the testimony a little bit um last
[33:05] Wednesday uh when brother Seth coffee
[33:07] was preaching um I don't know really I
[33:10] can't really explain it but right when
[33:12] the song service ended I was fine all
[33:14] day and as soon as the song service
[33:16] ended I just I got so defeated I I
[33:19] couldn't even pay attention during this
[33:21] during the service that or the sermon
[33:23] that he preached just because I had all
[33:25] these just discouraging thoughts of it
[33:27] was just random I know it was just a
[33:28] devil but it just it just clouded over
[33:31] the entire sermon for me I I I couldn't
[33:34] even pay attention because of them I
[33:36] just couldn't stop crying it was so
[33:38] random and it got to the point where
[33:40] towards the end of the service I was
[33:42] like I'm I'm not even going to go up to
[33:44] play the keyboard because I just don't
[33:45] feel like it's there's a point to it
[33:48] right now I just need to stay in my seat
[33:49] and
[33:50] pray and then he said you know can all
[33:54] the musicians come up and I just kind of
[33:55] stood up out of a habit and I was like
[33:57] well you know may as well I just stood
[33:58] up
[33:59] anyway I'll just cry and pray in my sea
[34:02] while I play um so as he was continuing
[34:05] to preach I was just you know staring at
[34:08] the back of his head listening and I I
[34:10] just had this thought in my head of God
[34:12] you know I I had all these thoughts that
[34:15] distracted me from the sermon I need him
[34:18] to either turn around and look at me and
[34:20] say something that I can take home and
[34:23] because I couldn't get anything from his
[34:24] sermon I need him to say something that
[34:26] I can take home you know or he's going
[34:28] to turn around to Zach and say something
[34:30] that we can both benefit from it was at
[34:33] 5 Seconds when that thought left my head
[34:35] that he turned around mid
[34:38] sentence and just looked at me hallu and
[34:43] I felt like my thoughts in my mind was
[34:45] just an open book because he just I
[34:46] don't know whoever was there he just
[34:48] stared at me for like 10 seconds dead
[34:51] silence and just spoke exactly what I
[34:53] needed to hear he said you know God
[34:54] loves you God has always loved you
[34:56] before the foundation of the world he
[34:57] knows your every need and there was such
[35:00] a pull to you and he said every single
[35:02] one of your I another thing I had had so
[35:05] many different things that were you know
[35:07] pestering me you know a little bit of
[35:09] debt that we'd accumulated and some and
[35:11] some other things that were that where
[35:13] we were stressed out about you know
[35:14] trying to figure out how to pay it and
[35:17] when he said all your prayers were
[35:19] answered all your pray prayers have
[35:22] already been answered I just I took that
[35:25] and when he prayed after I just I just
[35:28] put my hands in my face and I laid
[35:29] everything out just the words came out
[35:31] everything that was on my heart I just
[35:33] prayed out loud and I said I I know that
[35:36] you're going to give me exactly what
[35:37] what he just said i' I've fully put my
[35:39] trust in
[35:40] that and then my dad told me a few days
[35:43] ago you know you need to testify and I
[35:44] was like well I'm going to testify when
[35:46] I see the results and I know well that
[35:51] kind of that kind of you know came back
[35:54] to buy me because well not really you
[35:56] know because a testimony is never come
[35:59] coming back to buy you but the main
[36:01] thing that I prayed about was our debt
[36:03] that was the first thing that left my
[36:04] mouth and we just did our taxes a few
[36:06] days ago and well yesterday and we found
[36:09] out not only are we getting enough back
[36:12] to pay every red scent back but an a
[36:15] surplus so that's one thing
[36:25] done so that's the first thing done and
[36:27] I know everything else is just going to
[36:29] follow I'm not even going to worry about
[36:30] it it's in God's
[36:40] hands so this song is a testimony the
[36:43] devil has been attacking my body all

[46:27] own body amen everybody clear with the
[46:30] Garment of a
[46:32] servant now we clear on that one was it
[46:36] hard easy so we need to dig more onto
[46:39] that then if you swallow that wonderful
[46:42] so the next one can be really positioned
[46:45] amen God trusted you with the
[46:49] Capstone this message have been trusted
[46:52] to be given into your
[46:54] hand amen so before message a Capstone
[46:58] is put on you that means you got
[47:00] perfection in
[47:01] you amen so God got to put you into a
[47:05] certain got to train you yes to know how
[47:08] to handle the Capstone message because
[47:11] it is dangerous think about anything you
[47:14] want coming in front of you if you upset
[47:18] will
[47:19] happen you don't want to bring a lion
[47:23] and you yourself begin to
[47:25] run

[47:30] and say hey may the Lord strike you and
[47:32] somebody's dead you need to be trained
[47:35] how to handle that when the disciple
[47:38] came out from the city they say master
[47:40] or I mean command the fire and Jesus
[47:44] turned around and look at them and say
[47:46] boy these need to get in
[47:48] Pentecost they need to go to the Apper
[47:50] room they're not ready yet to handle
[47:53] amen but the same people when the Holy
[47:56] Ghost came on them then they turn around
[47:58] they say what I have I give it to you so
[48:01] you got to be trained under the master
[48:03] amen because what you have your
[48:05] potential is greater than you think
[48:09] despite what the devil is doing the
[48:11] difference between a seed and a sand
[48:13] there is a life in a
[48:15] seed both of them are in the ground but
[48:18] one has a life when the sun come truct
[48:21] the seed then it makes a difference he
[48:23] shows that you're not just a
[48:25] dirt but you are are a person with a
[48:28] life on inside so when the Evening Sun
[48:31] have come the light have come on the end
[48:33] time now when the light is shining in
[48:35] our lives it begin to show the
[48:38] difference between you and anybody else
[48:41] that is in the world because in God we
[48:43] like pocketing his Chang you remember
[48:46] the changes in his pocket you remember
[48:48] some are pennies some are dollar some
[48:50] are this this it is his sovereignty amen

[53:09] chapter the book of St John the 18th

[53:14] share a little bit of our inspiration
[53:16] that we picked up here from the message
[53:18] uh to you tonight in in John
[53:20] 18 and verse number
[53:23] 37 um pilot here is recording ording the
[53:27] the case of Christ being arraigned
[53:28] before Pilate and in the 37th verse
[53:33] pilate therefore said unto him art thou
[53:35] a king then Jesus answered thou sayest
[53:38] that I am a king to this end was I born
[53:42] that's and for this cause came I into
[53:45] the world Amen that I should bear
[53:47] witness of the truth everyone that is of
[53:51] the truth heareth my voice now we can
[53:56] say it very plainly the voice is the
[53:58] message in verse 38 pilate saith unto
[54:01] him now look at this question what is
[54:05] truth and when he had said this he went
[54:08] out again unto the Jews and sa unto them
[54:10] I find him in him no fault at all that's
[54:14] but ye have a custom that I should
[54:17] release unto you one at the Passover
[54:19] will ye therefore that I release unto
[54:21] you the king of the Jews then cried they
[54:24] all again saying not this man look how
[54:28] look how much they had reduced who he
[54:30] was not this man but barabus now barabus
[54:36] was a robber so brother Bram says they
[54:39] refused the anointed word and received a
[54:42] robber amen let's just bow our hearts
[54:45] together tonight Heavenly Father we
[54:47] thank you for the anointing that we feel
[54:48] in the building Lord knowing that the
[54:51] angels of God have assembled themselves
[54:53] here tonight the Believers have gathered
[54:55] here at the appointed time and Lord as
[54:57] we as we report to duty we're inviting
[54:59] you to come Lord may you be the speaker
[55:02] here tonight may you drive out every
[55:04] Spirit that's unlike the Holy Spirit and
[55:07] Lord may you help us to get ourselves
[55:08] out of the way amen Lord these things
[55:10] we've been pondering and looking at and
[55:12] meditating over I pray tonight some way
[55:15] somehow that you would send the spirit
[55:17] of wisdom and Revelation into the
[55:19] building yes Lord that you could
[55:21] transfer these things from my thoughts
[55:23] and my heart and place them into the
[55:25] hearts of your children Lord that they
[55:27] would be edified by the ministry of
[55:29] perfection lord of the word of God
[55:31] father heal the sick Lord Save The Lost
[55:34] Lord filled with the Holy Ghost and Fire
[55:36] and we'll be sure to give you all the
[55:37] praise all the honor and all the glory
[55:40] in Jesus Christ's mighty name we pray
[55:43] and all the Believers says amen amen and
[55:46] amen God bless you this evening amen as
[55:48] you have your seats I want to from those
[55:50] scriptures to talk to you here for just
[55:52] a few moments tonight if I titled this I
[55:54] want to speak to you on opportunity
[55:56] unities presented by the message of the
[55:59] hour amen opportunities presented by the
[56:02] message of the hour when you look at the
[56:04] definition of the word opportunity yes
[56:06] sir it is a set of circumstances that
[56:10] makes it possible to do something amen a
[56:13] set of circumstances that makes it
[56:16] possible to do something amen it is a
[56:18] chance for success or an advancement
[56:21] occurs so when there is an opportunity
[56:24] given amen it is a is an advancement it
[56:27] is a it is a possibility amen but it's
[56:30] because things have been fixed a certain
[56:33] way Amen to cause the advancement or to
[56:36] cause the success now brother says it
[56:38] very beautiful in the Easter seal he
[56:40] said oh Christian what an opportunity we
[56:43] have sir we have opportunities that St
[56:46] Paul never dreamed of having we have
[56:48] opportunities that Enoch and Elijah and
[56:51] all of them never had amen the
[56:53] opportunities that we have now
[56:56] amen I love how the prophet of God says
[56:58] this these opportunities are not in the
[57:01] future and they've not just been in the
[57:03] past amen but these opportunities are
[57:06] now they're in the present so we find
[57:08] then in 1 John 3:1 the Bible said behold
[57:12] what Manner amen of love the father hath
[57:15] bestowed upon us amen that we should be
[57:18] called the sons of God now listen to
[57:20] this therefore the world knoweth us not
[57:24] amen because it knew him so the world
[57:27] does not recognize the sons of God
[57:30] because they did not recognize the Son
[57:32] of God Amen but beloved now are we the
[57:35] sons of God and it does not yet appear
[57:38] what we shall be amen but we know that
[57:41] when he shall appear we shall be like
[57:44] him for we shall see him as he is amen I
[57:47] want you to catch that when he shall
[57:49] appear we shall be like him for we shall
[57:53] see him as he is now brother says it
[57:56] very beautifully he says we are in
[57:58] another pilot Hall we are in another
[58:01] pilot Hall so what it's telling me amen
[58:04] is Pilot's Hall was a place of
[58:07] opportunity the prophet of God picks
[58:09] this up in the Oddball and he says in
[58:11] the days of Jesus he was a fool to the
[58:13] world see to pilate but pilate was a nut
[58:16] see not also amen but to turn him down
[58:19] so pilot brother saying pilot was crazy
[58:22] amen because he turned him down he said
[58:25] he had an opportunity but when he had
[58:27] his opportunity to accept it he wanted
[58:30] some kind of a clown some kind of a
[58:32] trick some kind of a magic rabbit to
[58:34] bring out of a hat you know or something
[58:36] he said oh I would see you do some
[58:38] tricks you know or something like that
[58:40] he was a nut himself see he had a chance
[58:44] to receive it but he didn't amen pilate
[58:47] had an opportunity Amen to receive the
[58:50] anointed word but he didn't another
[58:52] place brother said pilate his only
[58:54] opportunity now think about this this
[58:56] was the only opportunity he ever had he
[59:00] said and he asked him he wanted to see
[59:01] something done he said let me see some
[59:04] sign brother said he ought to have
[59:06] repented amen so here's a prophet
[59:09] identifying amen what pilate should have
[59:11] done in his opportunity or when a set of
[59:15] circumstances was put together he should
[59:17] have repented but instead he sought
[59:20] after a sign I want to say thank God for
[59:23] sending us amen a Vindicated prophet
[59:26] messenger amen with the absolute message
[59:29] to bring us Amen to a complete
[59:32] identification of the word of God Amen
[59:34] and not to just look at that word not to
[59:37] just hear that word amen but to stand in
[59:40] the presence of that word and to accept
[59:43] that word and to receive it now amen
[59:45] I've just been pondering over this quote
[59:47] from the power of transformation brother
[59:49] said we are now ready for a battle the
[59:51] trumpet is to sound the hymns have been
[59:53] sung he said and now comes the word
[59:56] yes sir the songs have been sung the
[59:59] hymns have been sung the trumpet has
[1:00:01] sounded sir now comes the word he said
[1:00:04] but to hear these comments of these
[1:00:06] young soldiers here he said and myself
[1:00:08] getting old and listen around and your
[1:00:10] faith and confidence and what you have
[1:00:12] placed in to believe the message that I
[1:00:15] have been given of God now if it wasn't
[1:00:17] for you all the message would do no good
[1:00:21] if it wasn't for you all the message
[1:00:23] would do no good see it's got to be some
[1:00:26] somebody believe it amen somebody has
[1:00:29] got to believe it amen and as long as
[1:00:31] it's coming from God there is going to
[1:00:34] be somebody believ it amen amen that's
[1:00:37] what separates a message from God and a
[1:00:40] message from a church amen if it's
[1:00:42] coming from God somebody's going to
[1:00:44] believe it if it's coming from a church
[1:00:46] somebody might believe it amen listen
[1:00:48] but God has made a way he has affixed
[1:00:51] his great economy like that that when he
[1:00:54] sends for something there is something
[1:00:57] there to meet that something oh God Amen
[1:01:00] God has set it up amen God has arranged
[1:01:03] the circumstances amen God has fixed it
[1:01:06] so that when he sends something there's
[1:01:08] going to be somebody there to receive it
[1:01:11] amen can I say it like this amen just
[1:01:13] this week we had an appointment uh to to
[1:01:15] have some internet work done at the
[1:01:17] house and we had the appointment it was
[1:01:19] between 8 or 10 amen so so I forgot all
[1:01:22] about it you know amen at about 9:30 it
[1:01:24] dawned on me they were supposed to come
[1:01:26] so I called the company real quick and I
[1:01:27] said hey I said we missed the
[1:01:29] appointment I'm sorry can they still
[1:01:31] come the lady said well sir they've
[1:01:33] already been there and you weren't there
[1:01:35] uhhuh I said well I'm I'm on my way she
[1:01:38] said they've already been there and you
[1:01:40] weren't there she said now what we can
[1:01:42] do is we can set up another appointment
[1:01:45] I got to thinking about that amen they
[1:01:47] were there and I wasn't there amen and
[1:01:50] if I would have been there and they
[1:01:52] wouldn't have been there nothing would
[1:01:53] have got done so something has to be
[1:01:55] arrang
[1:01:56] amen There's an opportunity amen that
[1:01:59] when the when the worker arrives there's
[1:02:01] somebody there to let him in the house
[1:02:03] amen Church of the Living God Amen God
[1:02:06] has arranged you amen by a predestinated
[1:02:09] seed from before the foundation of the
[1:02:12] world that when he would begin to reveal
[1:02:14] the symbols he would begin to thunder
[1:02:16] the Thunders he would begin to tear off
[1:02:18] the seals he would begin to reveal the
[1:02:21] mind of God there would be somebody on
[1:02:23] the earth that would be in position
[1:02:26] Amen to meet the Revelation and when
[1:02:28] they stood face to face with it they
[1:02:30] would not say what is truth they would
[1:02:33] not say who are you they would say you
[1:02:35] are the Christ amen you are the son of
[1:02:39] the Living God my I want to say this
[1:02:41] tonight amen the message of the hour is
[1:02:44] not a man's message amen the message of
[1:02:46] the hour is a Divine message amen it's
[1:02:49] the king's message and you know what
[1:02:51] Paul said he said for this cause also we
[1:02:54] thank god without ceasing because when
[1:02:56] you receive the word of God which you
[1:02:59] heard of us you received it not as the
[1:03:01] word of men but as it is in truth
[1:03:04] somebody say truth you received it as it
[1:03:07] is in truth amen the word of God now
[1:03:11] watch they did not just receive the word
[1:03:13] of God Amen but the word which
[1:03:16] effectually amen worketh also in you
[1:03:19] that believe yes my so this word is not
[1:03:22] working in unbelievers it's not working
[1:03:24] in make believers come on church we got
[1:03:26] a whole tape called the trial and the
[1:03:29] prophet of God said blind prosecutor he
[1:03:31] did not promise to be here Amen in the
[1:03:34] form that you're looking for amen but
[1:03:36] according to the word he promised to be
[1:03:39] here in the form of a prophetic message
[1:03:42] and there's 900 and some denominations
[1:03:44] tonight amen they're looking for him
[1:03:47] they're trying to find him amen but God
[1:03:49] has so set it up amen that when the
[1:03:52] prophet would begin to sound there would
[1:03:54] be a bride on the Earth that would
[1:03:56] receive the message amen as the king's
[1:03:59] message she would receive it as a Divine
[1:04:01] message and then that message would
[1:04:04] begin to effectually worketh in you I
[1:04:06] want to say it the message is working in
[1:04:08] my hands amen the message is working in
[1:04:11] my feet the message is working in my
[1:04:13] heart it's working in my soul it's
[1:04:16] working all over me because I have not
[1:04:19] received it as the word of a man I've
[1:04:22] received it as the word of God we must
[1:04:24] receive and
[1:04:27] believe we must receive and believe the
[1:04:31] message of the hour at the same degree
[1:04:34] or level it was delivered in can I make
[1:04:37] a statement to you this message was not
[1:04:40] delivered casually no sir this message
[1:04:43] was not delivered luk horm no sir this
[1:04:46] message was not delivered half-heartedly
[1:04:49] no sir it was delivered with passion yes
[1:04:52] sir it was delivered with fervency
[1:04:54] that's right it was delivered with
[1:04:55] Authority it was delivered with power it
[1:04:59] was delivered with supreme authority
[1:05:01] then you know what I say I say we need
[1:05:03] to shake off the layot of sinness we
[1:05:05] need to shake off the lukewarmness we
[1:05:07] need to shake off all the cares and all
[1:05:10] the devils and spirits and come back to
[1:05:12] the message of the hour and stand on the
[1:05:15] word of God just like Rahab stood can I
[1:05:18] say this Rahab she received the message
[1:05:21] those spies came in there remember said
[1:05:24] those spies came in there and they
[1:05:26] delivered to her an Urgent Message
[1:05:28] listen Rahab didn't get an Urgent
[1:05:31] Message and handle it casually amen
[1:05:34] Rahab didn't get an Urgent Message and
[1:05:36] and believe it relaxed amen but the same
[1:05:39] urgency that it was delivered in was the
[1:05:42] same urgency she received it in and
[1:05:44] those spies told Rahab whatever you get
[1:05:48] underneath this token when the walls of
[1:05:50] Jericho comes down whatever is
[1:05:53] underneath that token will not not be
[1:05:56] destroyed I love what the prophet of God
[1:05:58] said he said Rahab went to work oh come
[1:06:01] on church amen Rahab went to work she
[1:06:04] went to her fathers and her mothers and
[1:06:06] her brothers and her sisters and she
[1:06:08] said come on Amen get underneath this
[1:06:11] token well I want to say this spoken
[1:06:13] word amen it's time to get up it's time
[1:06:16] to get to work amen because the night is
[1:06:18] coming and no man can work in the night
[1:06:21] but while there is light let us work let
[1:06:24] us get as many as we can
[1:06:26] underneath the token of the presence of
[1:06:29] Jesus Christ in the age we're living in
[1:06:32] I love what the prophet says he said oh
[1:06:34] God let us open our hearts and receive
[1:06:37] the message that Jesus is Alive tonight
[1:06:40] he is right here Among Us he is the same
[1:06:43] yesterday today and forever open up your
[1:06:47] house and let the messenger the Holy
[1:06:50] Ghost come in and identify You by his
[1:06:53] own presence come on church I'm not
[1:06:55] talking about a church identifying you
[1:06:58] I'm not talking about a preacher
[1:06:59] identifying you I'm talking about you
[1:07:02] opening up your heart opening up your
[1:07:04] house and letting the presence of this
[1:07:06] message more than a book more than a
[1:07:09] tape more than a picture but the person
[1:07:12] of the word Jesus Christ himself step
[1:07:14] into your home and identify his presence
[1:07:17] by the token on
[1:07:20] display come in and identify You by his
[1:07:23] own presence the token that's upon you I
[1:07:26] love what he says then you don't have to
[1:07:29] take anybody else's word for it he is
[1:07:32] there to speak for himself and he is the
[1:07:36] word when you receive the token when you
[1:07:39] receive the life of Jesus Christ and
[1:07:42] come underneath the identification of
[1:07:44] his presence then nobody else has to
[1:07:47] speak for you nobody else has to testify
[1:07:50] for you nobody else has to do your
[1:07:52] singing nobody else has to do your
[1:07:54] preaching nobody else has to do your
[1:07:56] praising nobody else has to do your pray
[1:07:59] they say Preacher what's wrong with you
[1:08:00] I tell you what's wrong with me is I
[1:08:02] opened up my heart and I let the person
[1:08:05] of this message step in there and I said
[1:08:08] you are the truth and you're nothing but
[1:08:10] the truth you are the absolute truth and
[1:08:13] we'll serve the word in the face of
[1:08:16] every
[1:08:17] difficulty that's right it's God's token
[1:08:20] to identify himself can I say this

[1:08:25] message he was bringing amen was of God
[1:08:28] and it was from God can you say this

[1:13:22] speaking now I'm just gonna say it that
[1:13:25] word spoken can I say this the word

[1:14:14] situations and God takes your pastor to
[1:14:17] the pull pit and he begins to preach
[1:14:20] that's not just a sermon it's the
[1:14:22] message of the hour it's an opportunity
[1:14:26] that God has arranged a set of
[1:14:32] circumstances God has set it up but he's
[1:14:35] done it on purpose he wants to talk to
[1:14:38] you he wants to speak to
[1:14:41] you now when God speaks to a man brother
[1:14:46] when God speaks to a man he gives him a
[1:14:48] purpose he gives him ambition and he
[1:14:52] gives him Faith to do it or to
[1:14:54] accomplish or to achieve what his
[1:14:56] purpose in life is what God called him
[1:14:59] to
[1:15:01] do so God doesn't call you to do
[1:15:04] something and say now go find the means
[1:15:06] to do it
[1:15:07] by but if God calls you to do something
[1:15:11] he supplies you what you need to do it
[1:15:15] with in other words the prophet of God
[1:15:18] said he has called us to be in the
[1:15:22] Church of God so we're not just here
[1:15:25] trying to find a purpose trying to find
[1:15:27] ambition trying to find Faith but the
[1:15:30] message that called us has revealed to
[1:15:33] us our
[1:15:35] purpose it has imparted to us ambition
[1:15:39] and has anointed our faith to accomplish
[1:15:42] the word that's been spoken over our

[1:18:32] to you in John
[1:18:36] 18:37 listen listen to the Amplified
[1:18:39] Bible in John 1837 pilate said to him
[1:18:43] you are a King Jesus answered you say
[1:18:46] correctly that I am a king this is why I
[1:18:49] was
[1:18:51] born look at this word born it is of me
[1:18:55] who father children to be born to be
[1:18:58] begotten of of women given birth to
[1:19:01] children so when pilate said you're a
[1:19:04] King Jesus turned around and said you
[1:19:07] have said correctly but watch this is
[1:19:11] why I was born so he automatically turns
[1:19:14] to his purpose and says and for this
[1:19:16] cause I have come into the world can I
[1:19:19] tell you this listen to this to testify
[1:19:22] to truth he was was born and come into

[1:29:22] what I think I think we ought to F our
[1:29:24] libraries back up with message
[1:29:27] material I think we ought to put the
[1:29:29] pictures back on the wall we ought to
[1:29:31] put the cloaks back on the wall come on
[1:29:33] church and you know what I think we
[1:29:34] ought to make it oh God I'm going to get
[1:29:37] in trouble I think we ought to make it
[1:29:39] plumb embarass for a preacher to have to
[1:29:42] walk by all kinds of message
[1:29:43] identifications and walk up to a pull
[1:29:46] pit and say is it okay to quote a
[1:29:49] prophet did you not see the pictures on
[1:29:52] the wall did you not see the books in in
[1:29:54] the office what are you saying preacher
[1:29:56] I'm saying this is the Battle of truth
[1:29:58] and somebody's going to rise and sharpen
[1:30:01] their sword and fight back against every
[1:30:03] devil that's trying to rob them of their
[1:30:05] identification in the
[1:30:10] [Applause]
[1:30:12] truth the people of God are of the
[1:30:16] truth they are a friend of the truth and
[1:30:19] belong to the truth brother them said an
[1:30:22] angel of God will take testify to the
[1:30:24] truth of God that's right and it will
[1:30:28] declare
[1:30:30] God it won't have some kind of mythical
[1:30:33] something and no one
[1:30:38] understands are you ready for this it'll
[1:30:41] speak of Jesus
[1:30:44] Christ and testify of Jesus Christ and
[1:30:48] produce Jesus Christ to the people see
[1:30:52] because Jesus was born
[1:30:54] of the will of God to save man now watch
[1:30:58] this and Satan tried to defeat that
[1:31:00] purpose through pilot by the Judgment he
[1:31:04] passed on the case of Jesus Christ
[1:31:06] brother said what should I do with this
[1:31:08] Jesus called Christ can can I take a
[1:31:10] minute and read this I hate to slow down
[1:31:12] but I want to lay this in here it was a
[1:31:14] time of the crucifixion of our Lord and
[1:31:16] Savior Jesus Christ he had done nothing
[1:31:20] as they could find in him he answered
[1:31:23] everything it was just the hour it had
[1:31:26] to be that
[1:31:29] way and it's a reason this had to happen
[1:31:32] to the greatest man ever lived on the
[1:31:34] earth or ever could live the reason it
[1:31:36] happened this way because it was time
[1:31:39] for it to happen see it must be thus and
[1:31:43] there was no way to escape it and Jesus
[1:31:47] had come to the Earth just exactly the
[1:31:49] way that God's word had predicted he
[1:31:51] would come he did just exactly what word
[1:31:54] said he would do he lived the life just
[1:31:56] exactly and God made known or manifested
[1:32:00] the seed of that time so God's purpose
[1:32:04] in sending Jesus was for the purpose of
[1:32:07] bringing out of bringing reality into
[1:32:09] the
[1:32:11] church go go to your tape uh total
[1:32:14] Deliverance I believe it is brother B
[1:32:15] says it like this he says now God's
[1:32:17] purpose or or excuse
[1:32:20] meemer kinsman redeemer God uh unfailing
[1:32:24] realities of living God he he hits it in
[1:32:26] there as well he says it like this he
[1:32:28] says the Christianity was looking for
[1:32:30] something to deliver them he said and
[1:32:32] here stands the god of reality now watch
[1:32:36] this can I say this brother brandham
[1:32:38] identified our purpose of being born and
[1:32:40] here's what he said Rec presence of God
[1:32:42] and recognize 64 we are born to believe
[1:32:46] the word of God we are born to believe
[1:32:50] Jesus Christ we were born to believe the
[1:32:53] message see there's something in you and
[1:32:57] what's in you identifies it's
[1:33:00] [Applause]
[1:33:01] real God have mercy there was a seed in
[1:33:05] you that when you heard the message come

[1:48:54] rapturing faith does not come by the
[1:48:56] open of the word it comes by Miracles no

[1:55:46] that finds things in the cloaks and
[1:55:48] here's what the prophet of God said goad

[2:04:30] voice voice so there's a connection
[2:04:33] between the voice of the seventh angel

[2:04:40] truth don't don't miss it friend

[2:04:50] in amen we're not come together to talk
[2:04:54] about the message we're come together to
[2:04:59] get in the message beneath it out yonder
[2:05:04] when you're suffering for your
[2:05:05] punishment and we're weeping and Welling
[2:05:06] and nashing of teeth that voice will
[2:05:08] scream back and
[2:05:10] forth you'll hear it all the time in
[2:05:13] that weary spooky place of hell don't
[2:05:17] fail direct quote now is your
[2:05:21] opportunity
[2:05:22] amen now look I've said some pretty
[2:05:24] rough things about airplane automobile
[2:05:26] remember they are horsepower too they're
[2:05:29] all horsepower but the church is just
[2:05:31] moving up holy ghost power it's the Holy
[2:05:33] Ghost we're justified by it's the Holy
[2:05:36] Ghost sanctifies us right it's the Holy
[2:05:39] Ghost fills us it's the holy ghost that
[2:05:43] gives us rapturing
[2:05:47] faith and the only hope for the church
[2:05:49] is to get direct quote get away from
[2:05:50] these manmade the Oles and get back to
[2:05:53] the Holy Spirit and get the spirit back
[2:05:56] in the church and get the church
[2:05:59] straightened out that's it that's it see
[2:06:03] and and and I'm just saying this it'll
[2:06:06] take a profit to straighten the church
[2:06:10] out any man that stands up and says I'm
[2:06:13] going to straighten out something in
[2:06:15] this
[2:06:16] message and then goes to his own
[2:06:18] interpretation of quotes and his own
[2:06:20] ideas that man is not saying what a
[2:06:22] prophet said
[2:06:26] amen R Stephen I caught something you've
[2:06:28] probably seen it but it it just it's
[2:06:30] it's it's astounding to me it'll take a
[2:06:32] profit to straighten it out see the only
[2:06:35] hope for the church is the coming of the
[2:06:39] Lord amen you know this you know this is
[2:06:42] an age where people actually say things
[2:06:45] like well that was just brother bram's
[2:06:48] opinion or actually not you know brother
[2:06:51] Stephen I've actually and I hate to even
[2:06:53] say this but I I've actually had
[2:06:56] preachers that claim to believe this
[2:06:57] message and they've said these words to
[2:06:59] me well that Cloud's really
[2:07:03] irrelevant it's really irrelevant
[2:07:05] they'll say things like it it really
[2:07:07] don't matter if it was there or not it
[2:07:10] really M it matters a lot but here's
[2:07:13] what I say a prophet of God writes the
[2:07:16] church age book remember he sends it to
[2:07:19] Lil to grammar eyesee it right right he
[2:07:22] sends an audio letter to leil remember
[2:07:26] and in that audio letter in the second
[2:07:28] paragraph here's what he says speaking
[2:07:31] about what's in the church age book he
[2:07:33] says in order to Proclaim this somebody
[2:07:35] say
[2:07:36] proclaima has to send a prophet in order
[2:07:40] to inject this to make this real again
[2:07:44] so somewhere it was real and something
[2:07:47] killed it but God would send a prophet
[2:07:50] in restoration to make it real again to
[2:07:53] show the people the hour we're living in
[2:07:56] because if they only see it in the hour
[2:07:59] past there's no hope for the church
[2:08:02] that's right the church must see it in
[2:08:05] the present tense so God sends his
[2:08:08] Prophet to
[2:08:10] manifest present tense of it
[2:08:16] amen John saw it Daniel wrote about it
[2:08:21] prophet of God walked to it and
[2:08:22] manifested
[2:08:26] it and said now there's your
[2:08:31] reality it's our Lord up
[2:08:33] [Applause]
[2:08:36] there but it took a prophet to go to
[2:08:39] Revelation
[2:08:40] 10:1 and bring it before the
[2:08:43] church and present you an
[2:08:47] opportunity for truth you love him
[2:08:50] tonight

[2:11:45] it glory to God now you know what I'm
[2:11:49] not
[2:11:50] Judas
[2:11:52] I'm not seeking opportunities to betray
[2:11:54] it I'm seeking opportunities to testify
[2:11:57] to
[2:11:58] it I'm looking for opportunities to lift
[2:12:01] it up somebody said brother Andrew you
[2:12:03] need to slow down you're just a you're
[2:12:05] just a wild crazy preacher I don't have
[2:12:07] time to slow down I've got a message and
[2:12:10] it's the message of the seventh angel
[2:12:12] and every pull pit I get I'm going to
[2:12:14] lift it up I'm going to raise it up and
[2:12:17] say you want a Revival Look Away to
[2:12:19] Jesus you want a healing look away to
[2:12:21] Jesus you want to take a Rapture Look

[2:12:34] [Applause]
[2:12:45] friend
[2:12:48] hallelujah amen amen amen amen amen amen
[2:12:53] amen
[2:12:58] amen in the time and the hour that we
[2:13:01] living in if you a
[2:13:04] coward you're not going to preach this
[2:13:07] message
[2:13:10] correctly do you hear my microphone good
[2:13:14] or should I change my
[2:13:16] microphone should I change my microphone
[2:13:19] do you hear me good do you hear me do
[2:13:21] you hear me good you don't understand
[2:13:24] why we get here and we get bold it is
[2:13:26] not
[2:13:29] us the Bible spoke about the disciple
[2:13:32] they got bold if you a coward in the
[2:13:36] hour that we are living in now you're
[2:13:39] not going to preach this message
[2:13:44] correctly let me repeat it again because
[2:13:47] there is a great
[2:13:49] cost now
[2:13:51] to preach the message then back
[2:13:57] then I'm free I don't have a bishop so
[2:14:01] I'm
[2:14:02] free you can take the step and push it
[2:14:04] wherever you want I'm free amen amen it
[2:14:09] is very difficult to preach the message
[2:14:13] now than back then back then everybody
[2:14:17] seems to believe the
[2:14:20] message
[2:14:22] over the time people begin to show their
[2:14:25] colors shama still hanging to the
[2:14:28] message but they don't believe it they
[2:14:30] don't want you to talk about the cloud
[2:14:32] they don't want you to get they don't
[2:14:33] even want to get deep into the word
[2:14:36] because the deeper you get into the word
[2:14:39] he unfold a different anointing that
[2:14:42] separate you from
[2:14:45] Pentecostal people want to preach this
[2:14:48] message like
[2:14:50] Baptist that's the truth and every time
[2:14:53] you want to stand on the line to preach
[2:14:57] this message it is very hard to preach
[2:15:01] it without bumping against the click
[2:15:03] because denomination has been created
[2:15:06] over the year but the time has
[2:15:11] come where we don't fear nothing we
[2:15:15] don't fear anything if the Bible said it
[2:15:19] and brother brandham said
[2:15:21] I will declare it without any
[2:15:24] question because the children of God
[2:15:27] must be free somebody must be set
[2:15:30] free somebody must know what is the
[2:15:33] truth somebody need to know what did
[2:15:35] Brother Bram say about this about this
[2:15:38] about this about this we need to know
[2:15:41] the
[2:15:42] message we can't play Church no
[2:15:47] more you want to say something you
[2:15:49] afraid you want to say something you
[2:15:51] afraid you afraid but somebody's bound
[2:15:53] right there do you think God is speaking
[2:15:55] this just like that whoever is playing
[2:15:58] around on the internet with the message
[2:16:00] you need to get off if you have a friend
[2:16:03] who keep sending you YouTube video and
[2:16:06] trying to convince you and to lure you
[2:16:08] away from this message you need to cut
[2:16:10] them off God is giving you a
[2:16:13] [Music]
[2:16:15] warning I asked somebody a question a
[2:16:17] preacher and I told him I say find me
[2:16:20] one right ET one rocket you can even go
[2:16:24] to Russia he have plenty of rocket go go
[2:16:27] get him to shoot rocket and find me one
[2:16:30] picture that will match this picture
[2:16:33] that will match the head of us
[2:16:36] man you will run out of all the rocket
[2:16:39] in the world none of them will be come
[2:16:41] out like this and this came out looking
[2:16:44] exactly like the head of Offman and
[2:16:47] brother brandham predicted a long time
[2:16:49] ago he said go get the lamb AB look on
[2:16:52] top of the Lamb Saab and you will see
[2:16:54] the Hebrew sign of the fire I showed you
[2:16:57] that before if you look at the Hebrew s
[2:16:59] exactly the so something that matches
[2:17:02] the Hebrew fire that was put by Dr
[2:17:05] lamama something that matches the
[2:17:07] picture of of man that was not painted
[2:17:09] by brother brandham and you still have a
[2:17:11] hard time believing that so what else
[2:17:13] can we give you by whom who is off the
[2:17:18] truth believe this thing in this church
[2:17:21] we put pictures
[2:17:23] wide identification there from the from
[2:17:27] the parking lot a big eagle looking at
[2:17:29] you telling you this is the home of the
[2:17:35] eagle from a parking lot they tells you
[2:17:38] that this is the home of an eego if you
[2:17:40] don't want it you go somewhere else but
[2:17:42] not in this church this one was raised
[2:17:45] to stand for the message and we will
[2:17:47] stand for the message of
[2:17:49] the
[2:17:52] God have given you opportunity to change
[2:17:54] your life you go to the Book of Daniel
[2:17:57] the Bible says this mystery will purify
[2:18:00] you this mystery God Gave You
[2:18:03] opportunity to change your life to
[2:18:05] correct your life to to to prepare your
[2:18:08] marriage to prepare your family to
[2:18:10] prepare your children to prepare you for
[2:18:13] the uncoming of the Messiah so we can
[2:18:15] meet him into the air what opportunity
[2:18:20] what else do you want where should we go
[2:18:23] again amen and you notice brother Bram
[2:18:27] say get in the message and he said get
[2:18:30] beneath meaning we have to be under
[2:18:36] Authority you you have to in other word
[2:18:39] the message must be on top when you in
[2:18:42] the message then the message get above
[2:18:44] of you in other word whatever William
[2:18:47] Marion Bram said you are under it
[2:18:51] because it's not the word of a man it is
[2:18:54] the word of God through a
[2:18:57] man that's why we don't argue with coat
[2:19:01] because we know it's a Vindicated
[2:19:03] message get beneath it if the message
[2:19:06] say something no matter how you love
[2:19:09] it take it
[2:19:12] off if you find an inspiration it's
[2:19:15] different than what brother Bram say
[2:19:17] please be humble enough take it way
[2:19:21] because after two years you found out
[2:19:23] brother brandham was right and you were
[2:19:25] wrong but if you ever humble yourself
[2:19:29] you will see the Holy Spirit coming W
[2:19:32] and say look at this look in the
[2:19:34] scripture here because you gave the
[2:19:36] prophet his correct
[2:19:41] Place amen if you don't God will lock it
[2:19:46] and give you argument and you will get a
[2:19:48] spirit
[2:19:49] of delusion to believe a lie and you're
[2:19:53] going to believe whatever is out there
[2:19:55] we thank God for the message of the hour
[2:19:58] amen I'm not ashamed of the message of
[2:20:00] the hour I'm not ashamed of the name of
[2:20:02] brother Bram I'm not ashamed to be
[2:20:05] identified with this picture and all the
[2:20:07] picture that I have I'm not ashamed this
[2:20:09] is my life amen amen Jehovah Witness
[2:20:14] would know we will make sure you know

[2:20:21] know some of them will even dress in
[2:20:24] Santa and everything to show you that
[2:20:26] this is what they believe and if they
