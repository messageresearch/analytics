[29:05] he's going to pray over the offering and

[29:09] testimony so
[29:11] yes ma'am
[29:18] thank you in the car accident
[29:20] my truck my kids and i were driving
[29:23] lights came on the dash it just shut off
[29:25] i had to pull over to the side of the
[29:27] road gave it a minute started the truck
[29:29] back up
[29:30] luckily i was able to make it to like an
[29:32] auto parts store gentlemen looked at it
[29:34] we got it back home but we were like 45
[29:37] minutes away from home
[29:39] so the lord got us all the way back home
[29:42] it sat there
[29:43] long story made short we took it to the
[29:46] dealer after the gentleman fixed it and
[29:48] replaced the alternator because that's
[29:49] what we thought it was
[29:52] kia looked over the truck um went last
[29:54] week and the gentleman at kia said you
[29:56] want the good news or the good news i
[29:59] said i want the good news
[30:01] because the lord had placed on my heart
[30:03] that it was the engine i said lord not
[30:05] the engine you know my husband's getting
[30:06] ready to leave it's just not the time
[30:10] we get there the guy says it was your
[30:13] engine
[30:14] he said but because it was under
[30:16] warranty you get a brand new engine
[30:18] so the lord blessed her
[30:22] amen amen
[30:24] yes ma'am
[30:28] i want to give god all the praise for
[30:29] all that he has done for me
[30:32] um i've been having
[30:33] some trouble to sleep but god has been
[30:36] so good to me that although with a
[30:39] little sleep he's given me the strength
[30:41] and i want to give him the praise
[30:43] because a day in this week i can't
[30:45] remember what day
[30:46] i had a rough night sleeping but finally
[30:49] i got up and when i wake up i was honor
[30:51] all the glory and all the praise that he
[30:53] could put a song in my heart through all
[30:55] the trials that we are going through
[30:58] hallelujah
[30:59] that's where his habitation is right and
[31:02] i pray
[31:03] anyone else
[31:05] come up brother um abel
[31:10] i have to give this testimony because i
[31:12] told the lord i would
[31:13] um
[31:14] but i wanted to give it wednesday but i
[31:16] didn't want to take up any more time
[31:18] when me and my wife got back from our
[31:20] trip that we took to tennessee we got
[31:22] home and i jumped in the shower and
[31:24] like a couple minutes later the water
[31:26] just stopped
[31:27] and i was like oh what's going on here
[31:29] so i go down and i check the breakers
[31:31] and the breakers on for the well
[31:33] i checked the valve and the valves open
[31:36] but our weld just shut down for some
[31:38] reason and i didn't know why so i got my
[31:41] electrical tester and i tested all the
[31:43] power going to the breaker box coming
[31:45] from the breaker box going to the well
[31:47] trying to see if i can figure out what
[31:48] was going on and there was power going
[31:51] down to the well there should the pump
[31:52] should have been working it wasn't so
[31:55] all signs pointed to the pump went bad
[31:57] and now nowadays the cheapest repair for
[32:01] a pump going bad is pulling it out
[32:03] putting a new one in and when i called a
[32:05] couple pump companies they said it would
[32:07] be 1 500 at least if not like 2 000 2500
[32:10] and upwards of there depending how deep
[32:12] our pump is and i remember the guy i
[32:14] bought the house from my wife's dad he
[32:16] told me that's a very deep well so now
[32:18] i'm thinking oh this is gonna be a
[32:20] really costly repair if it's the pump
[32:22] but
[32:23] earlier on five ten years ago when i was
[32:26] younger i would get really like
[32:28] i would get an attitude about that kind
[32:29] of stuff like i got in a car accident
[32:31] and i'm like lord why do you do this to
[32:33] me why does this have to happen to me
[32:34] and the lord's been maturing me from
[32:36] that and the last time i got in an
[32:37] accident i just said
[32:39] lord i know you you got it in control i
[32:41] know i know you know what you're doing
[32:42] and that's been my approach now is like
[32:44] i'm not going to complain like god has
[32:46] done so much for me he's blessed me in
[32:48] so many ways i'm no longer going to
[32:49] complain i may not understand it but i'm
[32:51] just going to put it in his hands so i
[32:53] got on google and i looked up like
[32:55] how to make sure it's not my pump and i
[32:57] don't want to pay a pump company and
[32:58] then it not be my pump and i saw
[33:01] something on there that says that it
[33:02] could be the capacitor and if it's the
[33:04] capacitor if you hard wire
[33:06] straight from the breaker to the pump
[33:07] and it kicks on then you're good just
[33:09] get the capacitor repaired so i did that
[33:11] and i was like oh this is the answer
[33:13] this is what it is i did that and the
[33:15] pump didn't kick on and i'm like okay
[33:17] like now it's the pump so i call the
[33:18] pump company and ask them if they can
[33:20] come out and get a new one and i was the
[33:22] night before i was in the room with my
[33:24] wife and i was like
[33:26] you know i know god knows what he's
[33:27] doing i'm not going to have an attitude
[33:29] it looks like it's our pump we might be
[33:31] out of water for like close to a week
[33:33] depending on how deep it is and how long
[33:34] it takes them to pull it out and get a
[33:36] new one in and get it installed all that
[33:38] i was like but we got places we can go
[33:40] for water we'll just be positive i know
[33:43] god knows what he's doing i trust him
[33:45] all that
[33:46] and i go to work and the pump guy comes
[33:49] out day i called him he was able to come
[33:51] out which they're crazy busy but he was
[33:52] able to come out the day of and he
[33:55] said that he thinks it's my capacitor
[33:57] and he's going to change it and i was
[33:58] like well i already hardwired it and the
[33:59] pump wasn't kicking on so i it says it
[34:01] wasn't the capacitor he's like the newer
[34:03] pumps can't run without the capacitor
[34:05] he's like so if we replace your
[34:07] capacitor that might be the problem i
[34:09] was like okay go for it he did it was
[34:11] 250 dollars my pump's back on we got
[34:13] water to house i was like praise the
[34:15] lord
[34:18] hey amen
[34:20] [Applause]
[34:22] hallelujah
[34:25] i i got a small one i've been um
[34:28] i went two weeks last last month i
[34:30] usually get paid weekly i went two weeks
[34:32] due to taking a little bit of time off
[34:33] in a transition of jobs again
[34:35] without a paycheck but the lord
[34:38] listen
[34:39] brother kelly yeah
[34:41] my my decision okay um
[34:44] but i've been doing
[34:45] just
[34:47] wide open with side work
[34:49] and
[34:51] mowing grass and aerating and it's been
[34:53] more than plenty
[34:55] it's just covered every bit of it so
[34:57] he's good to us he just take care never
[34:59] a day you know i mean i'll eat beans if
[35:01] i have to but that day we go to speaking
[35:03] food into existence it ain't gonna be no
[35:04] beans it's gonna be me a steak okay
[35:07] but
[35:08] but the good lord yes sir you got
[35:10] something brother michael okay
[35:13] okay
[35:14] but he's been good to us hasn't he he'll
[35:16] provide he provides amen amen
[35:20] [Applause]
[35:23] god bless you saints i really really
[35:26] want to thank the lord this morning for
[35:27] his grace
[35:29] and his mercy
[35:31] you know when
[35:31] [Music]
[35:33] i work at the va too so i deal with a
[35:36] lot of ptsd
[35:38] and a lot of times when we hear the word
[35:40] ptsd we only think of military
[35:43] but uh i just realized that as nurses we
[35:46] have a lot of ptsd with what's going on
[35:48] right now
[35:50] so yesterday the lord did something very
[35:52] very
[35:53] marvelous for me and my patients
[35:57] i went to work
[35:58] and uh
[35:59] you know we all have our attitudes right
[36:02] when
[36:03] you hear somebody is an alcoholic and
[36:06] drug user and
[36:07] meth and all that and that person is
[36:10] sick because of in hepatitis and they
[36:13] are sick because of what they the
[36:15] lifestyle they have
[36:16] people usually have very you know
[36:18] attitudes so
[36:21] but i thank god because i look at the
[36:23] person and not
[36:25] what i've been told or the report that
[36:27] i've been given
[36:29] so i had this
[36:30] gentleman a young man
[36:32] actually literally dying
[36:36] his belly swollen his bleeding from
[36:39] everywhere
[36:41] the mother
[36:42] his mother
[36:44] basically just left him for dead
[36:46] didn't want to give any consent for
[36:48] anything
[36:50] and i'm like lord i don't want him to
[36:52] die on my hands please
[36:54] just let him leave until at least until
[36:57] the end of my shift
[36:58] and then my other patient was also
[37:02] pruned you know laying on the abdomen
[37:04] is a hefty lady about 300 pounds
[37:07] intubated
[37:09] just fighting for her life
[37:11] so these two so i was dancing between
[37:14] the two
[37:15] when i said dancing literally moving
[37:17] from one room to the other and didn't
[37:20] get breakfast until 1 30 pm breakfast
[37:24] ended up not having any lunch but anyhow
[37:27] what the lord did for me for this man
[37:31] was amazing
[37:32] and while i'm taking care of him the
[37:35] song that i was just constantly singing
[37:38] was what a friend we have in jesus
[37:41] and and the other song that i sang here
[37:43] when they were dedicating the church
[37:45] [Music]
[37:47] and and so
[37:49] right
[37:50] just before that the nurse before me had
[37:53] not given him his very very important
[37:55] medication that he needed to bring his
[37:57] ammonia down please bear with me because
[38:00] this is really
[38:02] when you know when somebody has liver
[38:05] cirrhosis they the ammonia level goes up
[38:07] and they they get obtained
[38:10] so for three i'm getting report and
[38:12] she's telling me that three doses they
[38:14] have not given him that ammonia and in
[38:16] my heart i was just like lord why
[38:19] and simply because they could not get
[38:21] that medication to him when they give it
[38:23] it was just coming out but i'm like lord
[38:25] there must be a way
[38:28] so i designed my own way
[38:32] of giving him that medication and it
[38:34] actually retained that medicine and the
[38:37] ammonia level went down a little bit but
[38:40] as i because i turned him to give the
[38:42] medication he could not tolerate it and
[38:44] his oxygen saturation went into the 60s
[38:47] and i'm like lord no don't
[38:49] don't let this happen
[38:51] and so of course they had to call the
[38:53] mother to get consent to intubate him
[38:55] the mother said no i thought he was dead
[38:57] and
[38:58] anyhow we ended up intubating this man
[39:01] and after that he was just pouring blood
[39:03] pouring blood pouring blood from all
[39:05] over
[39:07] i i just kept on praying i said lord
[39:09] just hold him
[39:11] just hold him let him not die on me
[39:14] i want to thank god that he did not die
[39:17] on my shift
[39:19] and my other patient the other lady also
[39:22] made it through my shift
[39:24] and so at the end of the day
[39:26] eight o'clock is when i was leaving work
[39:28] i was just beaten just beaten down so
[39:31] tired
[39:33] so then at night i cannot sleep because
[39:35] i'm so tired i can't sleep

[40:58] i mean we think they'll go for all the
[40:59] testimonies i mean they're just power
[41:01] heads
[41:03] the evil father lord jesus
[41:05] what an opportunity lord that you have
[41:06] given to us this morning lord just come

[41:16] god
[41:17] lord jesus
[41:19] our deepest prayer lord is our voice if
[41:21] you still
[41:22] dead or god in the heart of some lord
[41:24] may you reason again father god when you
[41:26] rise up lord jesus in the house of your
[41:29] children father god those who have lost
[41:31] their zeal lord may you restore this
[41:33] your lord for your love for god the love
[41:35] of the truth father god jesus and that's
[41:37] the reason why we're here lord you just
[41:39] to hear from you once more father lord
[41:41] prayed all that
[41:43] just come lord god
[41:45] and see the desire of your heart your
[41:46] children lord may every knee be mad
[41:48] father god we know in your word lord
[41:50] there's no one to ever come to your
[41:51] presence and return the same father
[41:53] jesus that's our deepest desire so you
[41:56] may change our hearts lord god change
[41:58] our lives lord let this world lord be a
[42:00] transformation as father god lord pray
[42:03] for the offerings and ties lord jesus

[43:26] man you may have your seats
[43:29] testimony because we didn't even ask for
[43:30] them
[43:33] sorry about that don't care about it
[43:35] um do you have a testimony i was trying
[43:38] to keep it short
[43:40] but it's a long one
[43:42] but i just hope it would encourage
[43:44] somebody here this morning
[43:58] i don't know where to begin
[44:00] um
[44:02] yeah man god is good man
[44:05] god is good man um this year started out
[44:08] very
[44:10] very difficult for me unexpected
[44:12] um
[44:14] basically i was just
[44:16] seeing my life
[44:18] crumble before my eyes
[44:20] it felt like i was just falling apart
[44:23] but in case i was falling into place
[44:27] um
[44:28] my brother's brother edward said god do
[44:30] things that we don't understand and um
[44:32] but
[44:33] we just trust in him and
[44:36] so every the beginning of the year was
[44:38] hard i
[44:40] my faith was tested
[44:43] i lost my job back in at the end of
[44:45] march
[44:47] and
[44:48] so from march up until the end of august
[44:51] i didn't i didn't have a job
[44:54] and things got really really hard
[44:56] complicated
[44:57] one thing is after the other everything
[44:59] was just
[45:00] falling apart
[45:01] not working as as it's supposed to
[45:04] um but in all that there was still just
[45:06] something in me that just wouldn't give
[45:08] up
[45:10] um
[45:11] the devil will come and i have really
[45:13] mind battle this year really really
[45:16] tough tough time wouldn't sleep
[45:19] and i was just
[45:20] walking as a zombie and i couldn't sleep
[45:23] i spent days weeks
[45:25] had barely any sleep
[45:28] and
[45:29] in all that
[45:30] still i couldn't just give up and just
[45:33] walk away i just couldn't
[45:36] and
[45:38] though i would
[45:39] think about it but
[45:41] it just wouldn't make sense
[45:42] to me
[45:44] and then you know with the preaching i
[45:46] get to understand well that's my origin
[45:49] i mean um the way i was built
[45:52] you know was just to hold on
[45:55] and
[45:56] um
[45:57] so i didn't have a job i started
[45:59] applying elsewhere
[46:01] and
[46:05] the job that i would get it will just be
[46:08] something that i don't want to do
[46:10] so i was like lord i don't want to do
[46:12] this i don't want to do this one they
[46:14] will call me have an interview but
[46:16] something new won't just you know not
[46:18] this one you're not here but i do need a
[46:20] job lord
[46:22] give me a job but then i will apply they
[46:24] will call
[46:25] and i will you know just
[46:28] not this one and i would i would go
[46:30] places the low just tell me no not this
[46:32] one not this one
[46:33] and then i found this other job
[46:36] basically
[46:37] um it's life insurance
[46:39] i've been into the insurance industry
[46:41] industry i'm sorry and
[46:43] basically on this company you
[46:46] you are as independent agent you're
[46:48] working for yourself you represent the
[46:50] company but you're still working for
[46:51] yourself
[46:52] and once i found that i talked to the
[46:56] manager
[46:57] they
[46:58] just like me they were impressive my
[47:00] resume and interview and all that and
[47:02] the lord said this is it this is what
[47:05] you're gonna do
[47:06] but you know that
[47:08] i didn't have life insurance
[47:11] life insurance license so i had to get
[47:13] the course
[47:14] take the license go to the state take
[47:16] the exam
[47:17] and from there move forward so i took
[47:19] the course
[47:20] and it was time to go to the state to
[47:22] take the exam
[47:23] you give five attempts
[47:25] after five attempt
[47:26] if you fail you gotta take the course
[47:28] again
[47:28] so i went to the texan center first
[47:31] attempt failed
[47:33] second attempt failed
[47:35] third attempt to fail
[47:37] fourth failed load
[47:40] fifth i failed
[47:42] so i had again take the course again to
[47:44] the course again
[47:45] went back
[47:47] for the sixth attempt failed
[47:50] okay
[47:53] um
[47:54] i was like lord
[47:56] i know you said this everything else
[47:58] that you said everything else where you
[48:00] lead me it brought me to this
[48:02] this will be my seventh attempt
[48:04] and i'm about to pray for the seventh
[48:06] time
[48:08] and
[48:09] but i say lord
[48:11] before i take this test i'm just gonna
[48:13] take your word
[48:14] and give it back to you
[48:16] we're living in a seven
[48:18] seven inch
[48:20] the seven seals have been opened
[48:22] seven thunders
[48:23] the seven trumpet
[48:25] you send the seven messenger
[48:27] and you send them for me
[48:30] and seven
[48:31] is my favorite number
[48:33] do not let me pass c7
[48:35] i went and took the test
[48:37] seven attempt i passed
[48:48] and after i passed
[48:50] now it's going out the next step which
[48:52] will be
[48:53] i gotta go get my finger printed
[48:55] after your fingerprinting at the
[48:56] sheriff's office they gotta send your
[48:57] fingerprint to the fbi they gotta go
[49:00] through the uh
[49:01] background check with the fbi which
[49:03] another process you got to pay for the
[49:05] application for the state to approve
[49:07] your license
[49:08] um so a whole another
[49:10] few weeks waiting going through back and
[49:12] forth
[49:14] so
[49:17] um
[49:18] i called the state just something you
[49:19] know i just wanted to take a shortcut so
[49:21] it's like let me just call the state
[49:23] to make sure that i'm doing what i'm
[49:25] supposed to be doing
[49:27] so
[49:28] i called this day without me going to
[49:30] take my fingerprint
[49:31] just to make sure so i called the state
[49:33] and the lady that i was speaking with um
[49:36] since i already had my other
[49:38] uh insurance for auto at home
[49:40] um still this is a different lesson so
[49:42] you gotta do the same thing
[49:44] so i called the lady and then was
[49:47] speaking i told her you know what's the
[49:48] next step for me
[49:50] and then she was like okay let me look
[49:51] you up and i should look me up
[49:54] she say you don't need to do anything
[49:56] else
[49:57] i said no i do need to take my
[49:58] fingerprint
[49:59] pay the feed do all that she said no
[50:02] caleb your license will be approved in
[50:04] next 24 hours
[50:13] so the next 24 hours i didn't pay
[50:15] nothing
[50:16] and that's the law but i just thank the
[50:18] lord because in my case he had to bypass
[50:21] the law and i'm just grateful
[50:28] and i'm just really really grateful to
[50:30] to to the lord because of things that
[50:31] i've went through some of the brothers
[50:33] here know what i'm talking about um
[50:36] that
[50:38] it wasn't me who kept myself you know
[50:40] times i didn't have a job it wasn't my
[50:42] saving account that kept me it wasn't it
[50:44] wasn't
[50:45] it was none of that it was the lord who
[50:47] kept me and i'm just grateful for him
[50:50] because to all that i went through
[50:52] i'm thankful for it because he has
[50:54] created character in me
[50:56] and um

[1:05:49] genesis chapter 19.
[1:05:52] this is where we stopped before we got
[1:05:53] the region of galleria
[1:05:56] so you know how to create your
[1:05:58] atmosphere

[1:06:46] out
[1:06:47] when you turn the light on all the

[1:07:26] word where there is no high blood
[1:07:28] pressure
[1:07:29] no tension no trouble no sorrow no
[1:07:33] sickness even though i'm not yet in the
[1:07:35] presence of the lord
[1:07:37] but in a strange land i can live like a
[1:07:40] prince
[1:07:41] it's a matter of choice
[1:07:45] amen
[1:07:46] blessed be the name of the lord genesis
[1:07:49] 19 24.
[1:07:52] jesus said there was a burning hair
[1:07:55] there was a
[1:07:57] hell with fire
[1:07:59] by the bottom say there's no burning
[1:08:00] hair
[1:08:02] did anybody got the answer
[1:08:05] okay somebody got the answer
[1:08:07] i need money to give him a microphone
[1:08:09] [Laughter]
[1:08:14] amen
[1:08:15] genesis 19 verse 24
[1:08:18] then the lord not anybody else it's god
[1:08:21] who did it
[1:08:22] then the lord reign
[1:08:24] you remember this right
[1:08:26] reign upon sodom and gomorrah what
[1:08:30] and what
[1:08:31] you might be seated
[1:08:33] upon sodom
[1:08:36] and go and gomorrah
[1:08:38] we know what happened in those city
[1:08:40] right
[1:08:41] wicked wicked city god's reigns what
[1:08:45] fire
[1:08:47] and brimstone
[1:08:51] what's wrong with fire
[1:08:53] and know what's wrong with brimstone
[1:08:56] the lord rained fire and brimstone from
[1:08:59] the lord out of heaven
[1:09:02] so they came out of heaven
[1:09:05] and he overthrew
[1:09:07] those cities
[1:09:08] and all the plants
[1:09:10] and all then he had the inhabitant of
[1:09:13] the cities
[1:09:15] and that which grew upon the ground
[1:09:18] so
[1:09:19] not only was sodom and gomorrah destroy
[1:09:22] but there were other cities around
[1:09:24] amen so the lord destroyed everything
[1:09:27] the houses the people the the grass
[1:09:30] everything else was burned completely
[1:09:33] amen burn completely let me drop down to
[1:09:37] it's not on my reading but let me drop
[1:09:39] down since it came on verse 27
[1:09:43] and abraham got up early in the morning
[1:09:46] to the place where he stood before the
[1:09:48] lord
[1:09:49] and he looked towards sodom and gomorrah
[1:09:53] and toward all the land of the plan
[1:09:56] remember lot went there he never seen
[1:09:59] that destruction before be careful what
[1:10:01] you choose
[1:10:03] and be held and low the water
[1:10:06] the smoke of the country went up as the
[1:10:09] smoke of water
[1:10:11] so somebody was really burning there
[1:10:13] until it causes smoke
[1:10:18] everybody
[1:10:19] let's go to luke chapter 16.
[1:10:22] we were this could not touch it when we
[1:10:25] went into hell
[1:10:33] by the scripture
[1:10:36] nobody will go to hell again
[1:10:42] i am not going to hell
[1:10:46] my origin my origin came from up there i
[1:10:49] came from god i'm going back up to god
[1:10:53] amen
[1:10:54] luke chapter 16 verse 22.
[1:10:59] amen
[1:11:00] and it came to pass that the beggar died
[1:11:04] and was carried by angels into the bosom
[1:11:08] of abraham
[1:11:10] the rich men also did water
[1:11:13] and was water
[1:11:14] so death happened to both of them
[1:11:19] so the first step
[1:11:21] which we know it's the
[1:11:24] first death we already talked about this
[1:11:27] which happened in the physical
[1:11:30] it happened to everybody
[1:11:34] even though some will not die
[1:11:36] we have a promise of that it happened to
[1:11:39] christians
[1:11:40] just like it happened to our sister
[1:11:42] and it happened also to sinners
[1:11:46] amen
[1:11:47] the problem is not here
[1:11:51] this is no problem
[1:11:55] amen
[1:11:56] the problem is after
[1:11:59] you die amen
[1:12:01] in other words if a sinner can died in a
[1:12:04] car wreck
[1:12:06] and a christian also can die in a car
[1:12:08] wreck
[1:12:10] that's not a problem
[1:12:12] the problem is what happened after death
[1:12:17] one
[1:12:18] was carried
[1:12:19] by angels
[1:12:23] you see the difference
[1:12:25] and another one
[1:12:27] he was buried
[1:12:30] amen
[1:12:32] both of them both of their body were
[1:12:34] buried both bodies will be destroyed
[1:12:38] but what he's after
[1:12:41] that's the problem amen
[1:12:43] [Music]
[1:12:44] and inhale
[1:12:46] now inhale
[1:12:48] and inhale he lift up his eyes
[1:12:52] being in water
[1:12:54] did he say he was burning
[1:12:57] being in torment
[1:12:59] and see her and sees abraham a far off
[1:13:03] and lazarus in his bosom
[1:13:06] and he cried and said
[1:13:08] father abraham
[1:13:10] so he knew abraham
[1:13:12] and he called him father because the
[1:13:14] jews told jesus christ our father is
[1:13:18] abraham
[1:13:19] amen so this is a jew
[1:13:23] this is a jew
[1:13:26] when he went there he recognizes their
[1:13:29] father abraham
[1:13:31] when you go there you're not going to
[1:13:32] see abraham
[1:13:34] amen
[1:13:39] okay you're going to meet also somebody
[1:13:41] there
[1:13:44] and you're going to call him our
[1:13:46] precious brother
[1:13:53] you swallow that
[1:13:57] and he cry and say father abraham
[1:14:01] have mercy on me and send lazarus
[1:14:04] that he may dip the tip of his finger in
[1:14:07] water
[1:14:09] in water and cool my water
[1:14:12] he didn't say cool my feet
[1:14:14] or cool my head
[1:14:16] he's more worried about the tongue
[1:14:19] so the most one that got more torture in
[1:14:21] hell
[1:14:22] is the tongue
[1:14:24] why
[1:14:28] life and death in the power of water
[1:14:34] i don't like you
[1:14:36] [Music]
[1:14:38] i'm sick and tired of this
[1:14:41] i feel sick
[1:14:43] [Music]
[1:14:46] amen
[1:14:47] and comb my water
[1:14:50] my tongue
[1:14:51] for i am burning in this flame
[1:14:56] i'm water
[1:14:58] so the flame in here are not burning
[1:15:03] they are tormenting
[1:15:07] amen
[1:15:08] was very random wrong
[1:15:10] was jesus wrong
[1:15:14] amen
[1:15:17] verse 25 but abraham say son
[1:15:20] remember that you in your lifetime
[1:15:24] receive your good things
[1:15:26] and lazarus and likewise lazarus evil
[1:15:29] things but now he's comforted and you
[1:15:32] are burning
[1:15:34] you are tormented everybody clear
[1:15:37] let's go now to revelation chapter 14.
[1:15:41] sodom gomorrah and the cities iran
[1:15:44] destroyed by fire and
[1:15:46] brimstone
[1:15:48] that happened in the natural
[1:15:50] and it created smoke
[1:15:53] everybody clear
[1:15:54] in a natural
[1:15:56] hell also have smoke
[1:15:59] but it's a different kind of smoke
[1:16:03] amen
[1:16:04] hell i got smoke
[1:16:06] but it's a different kind of smoke
[1:16:08] amen
[1:16:11] let me help you up because somebody is
[1:16:13] probably thinking go to revelation 9.
[1:16:16] don't want to say pastor say it's a
[1:16:18] different smoke amen
[1:16:21] let's go to revelation 9.
[1:16:24] you took my time
[1:16:26] i didn't
[1:16:27] whine
[1:16:35] so you complete the remaining
[1:16:41] revelation nine verse one and the fifth
[1:16:44] angel sounded
[1:16:46] and i saw a star did what
[1:16:50] it's a fallen and a star
[1:16:53] a fallen angel
[1:16:55] how did you fall from
[1:16:58] heaven oh
[1:17:00] you understand that style now
[1:17:03] star fall from heaven to the earth and
[1:17:06] to him was given
[1:17:08] the key of the bottomless water
[1:17:11] that's his chamber that's his property
[1:17:13] he can go there we don't have any
[1:17:15] problem
[1:17:16] and he opened the bottomless pit
[1:17:19] his new residency
[1:17:22] they built him that very good
[1:17:24] made sure they got homeowner association
[1:17:26] down there
[1:17:28] and he opened the bottomless pit
[1:17:31] and there arose a water
[1:17:34] a smoke out of the water
[1:17:37] so something is burning really
[1:17:40] i thought brother stephen you say those
[1:17:42] flames are just tormenting
[1:17:44] they're not burning so where does the
[1:17:46] smoke come from
[1:17:48] watch that smoke
[1:17:51] and there eros a smoke out of the pit
[1:17:54] as the smoke of a great water when sodom
[1:17:58] and gomorrah was destroyed it was like
[1:18:00] the smoke of the water
[1:18:05] amen
[1:18:06] are we okay
[1:18:08] okay stay awake and the sun
[1:18:10] and the air were darkened by reason of
[1:18:14] the smoke of the pit the smoke of hair
[1:18:18] so it's fire let's see
[1:18:21] watch verse 3
[1:18:22] and there came out of water
[1:18:26] water
[1:18:29] we know those locusts right we dealt
[1:18:31] with them in living world probably we
[1:18:33] might review them
[1:18:34] came locust upon the earth and to them
[1:18:38] was given power as the scorpion of the
[1:18:41] earth have power
[1:18:43] and he was commanded them that they
[1:18:45] should not hurt the grass of the earth
[1:18:48] neither any green thing neither any tree
[1:18:50] but only those men which have not the
[1:18:53] seal of god in their water
[1:18:55] only the people that do not have the
[1:18:58] holy ghost
[1:18:59] verse seven and the shape of the lokis
[1:19:02] were like the horse
[1:19:03] like two horses prepare for battle
[1:19:07] and on their heads whereas he were
[1:19:09] clowns like gold and their faces were as
[1:19:13] the faces of water what kind of creature
[1:19:15] is that one
[1:19:17] look like a locust and then a man and if
[1:19:20] you continue verse 9 and they had
[1:19:23] breastplate as he wear the bracelet of
[1:19:25] iron and the sound of the wings as was
[1:19:29] as the sound of chariot of many horses
[1:19:31] running to battle and that and the head
[1:19:34] tear like to scorpion and them and there
[1:19:37] were stings in their tail and they had
[1:19:40] power and their power was to hurt men
[1:19:43] five months
[1:19:45] those were demon
[1:19:48] anybody clear so the smoke of hell
[1:19:51] brings demon
[1:19:53] it's not like the natural smoke
[1:19:55] we clear now let's go to revelation 14
[1:19:58] then we're going to pray
[1:20:00] so sodom gomorrah city is destroyed by
[1:20:03] fire and brimstone
[1:20:05] amen
[1:20:06] on the first death everybody if you were
[1:20:08] a candidate in the book of life to die
[1:20:12] it's going to happen to you that's not a
[1:20:14] big deal
[1:20:15] it's just a baggy what happened after
[1:20:17] death that's the problem
[1:20:19] revelation chapter 14
[1:20:21] let's go to verse 9.
[1:20:24] if you're there you can say amen and the
[1:20:26] third angel you know who that angel is
[1:20:28] follow them saying with a loud voice if
[1:20:30] any man worship who

[1:20:35] the end time where the beast and the
[1:20:37] image revelation number uh chapter 13 is
[1:20:40] and receive his mark in his forehead
[1:20:43] we're talking about the mark of the
[1:20:44] beast end time or in his hand
[1:20:48] the same shall drink of the wine of the
[1:20:50] ruffleful
[1:20:52] the wrath of god now he's a lion he's no
[1:20:54] more lamb
[1:20:56] which is poured out with that mixture
[1:20:58] into the cup of his indignation his
[1:21:02] anger
[1:21:03] and he shall be water
[1:21:06] he shall be burning
[1:21:10] he must be he shall be tormented with
[1:21:13] water and water the fire of sodom and
[1:21:17] gomorrah was burning
[1:21:20] because he was in the natural that was a
[1:21:22] burning fire
[1:21:24] ever clear
[1:21:27] but this fire that comes from god
[1:21:31] and the brimstone that comes from god
[1:21:35] dab fire and brimstone does not burn
[1:21:39] it torments
[1:21:43] am i reading a different bible
[1:21:48] this one torment
[1:21:51] why is this one burning and this one
[1:21:53] tormenting
[1:21:55] this one affects the body
[1:21:59] amen
[1:22:00] but when you die your body stay in the
[1:22:03] grave
[1:22:04] what goes out is not your body
[1:22:08] what goes out is the soul
[1:22:11] or the spirit
[1:22:13] you cannot take natural fire to burn a
[1:22:16] spirit
[1:22:18] if it was like that i will put fire all
[1:22:20] around my house and no demon will come
[1:22:22] around
[1:22:25] so demon don't care about your cookout
[1:22:32] you can put your cook out he doesn't
[1:22:34] scare devil
[1:22:36] you must have a different fire
[1:22:41] brother robert we might need to put a
[1:22:43] picture of that over there
[1:22:48] you must have a different fire
[1:22:50] that torment demon
[1:22:57] hallelujah
[1:22:58] and he shall be tormented with fire
[1:23:01] verse 10 and brimstone
[1:23:04] in the presence of the holy angel the
[1:23:06] elected one and in the presence of the
[1:23:10] lamb
[1:23:11] and the water
[1:23:12] you see another smoke again
[1:23:14] and the smoke of their torment
[1:23:17] not the smoke of their flame
[1:23:21] did you read that correctly
[1:23:23] the bible didn't say they smoke off
[1:23:25] their flame
[1:23:26] the smoke of the flame that's in the
[1:23:28] natural upon sodom and gomorrah in the
[1:23:31] cities but this is the smoke of the
[1:23:34] torment
[1:23:35] so this torment here created smoke
[1:23:39] they smoke off their torment who want to
[1:23:41] go back to hell again
[1:23:45] they smoke off their torment
[1:23:48] ascended up forever and ever
[1:23:51] and they have no water
[1:23:53] if you notice
[1:23:55] when this
[1:23:57] fire and brimstone are tormenting there
[1:24:01] is a smoke that goes with it
[1:24:04] because the people over here have no
[1:24:07] water
[1:24:09] keep that in mind
[1:24:11] there's no rest
[1:24:13] somebody else get rest
[1:24:19] is it okay

[1:24:38] his waters

[1:24:42] that's why the restless over there
[1:24:45] you remember no more rest over there so
[1:24:48] you make sure you're in rest right here

[1:27:24] lord we thank you again for your grace
[1:27:27] your love your mercy father and for
[1:27:29] everything you have been doing for us
[1:27:31] and strengthening this church and

[1:27:38] opportunity to gather together around
[1:27:41] the revealed word of the hour father we
[1:27:44] have done what any man that you have
[1:27:47] given grace and ability to do can do but
[1:27:50] up to now it takes the holy spirit to
[1:27:53] come and speak to your children and
[1:27:55] father quicken those that need to be
[1:27:57] quickened and bring lord father those
[1:28:00] souls that came from thee back again in

[1:28:08] father lord be the alpha and the omega
[1:28:11] of this service move me completely out
[1:28:13] of the way and may you speak to your
[1:28:15] children may the devil and his army be
[1:28:18] completely sealed out of this place may
[1:28:21] the holy fire of the peter of fire be
[1:28:23] lord father uh granted to your children
[1:28:26] and may your presence feel this place in
[1:28:29] the name of jesus christ
[1:28:31] amen
[1:28:32] god bless you you've already been seated
[1:28:35] we continue with the second banquet of
[1:28:38] esther part 13 we're dealing with the
[1:28:41] second death
[1:28:42] now lord's willing we're going to enter
[1:28:44] the lake of fire amen
[1:28:48] when we were talking about the origin
[1:28:51] we started from heaven and something
[1:28:53] happened in heaven a rebellion happened
[1:28:55] in heaven from lucifer and the two
[1:28:58] kingdom were separated they used to live
[1:29:01] together when they were under the
[1:29:03] jurisdiction of god amen and god put
[1:29:06] them under free moral agency you
[1:29:09] remember that question and answer and
[1:29:10] then from there the two kingdoms split
[1:29:13] and one kingdom was put down amen all
[1:29:16] the way and it created three places
[1:29:19] that's why the bible say in heaven on
[1:29:22] the earth and
[1:29:24] and underneath the earth everybody clear
[1:29:26] so no one was worthy in the earth in the
[1:29:28] heaven no one was worthy on the earth
[1:29:31] and no one was worthy under the earth
[1:29:33] everybody cared so far so when they were
[1:29:36] thrown into the into hell we called them
[1:29:40] or the scripture called them wandering
[1:29:42] stars
[1:29:43] and jude says that they are spot in your
[1:29:45] feast of charity so where the children
[1:29:48] of god are sitting in love everything is
[1:29:51] doing good watch out for somebody to
[1:29:54] always cause trouble but i'm saying when
[1:29:57] the disciple was sitting in the boat
[1:30:00] feasting upon the meeting that jesus
[1:30:03] christ have brother branham said there
[1:30:06] was one disciple who was at the corner
[1:30:08] there having a bad attitude
[1:30:11] his name was judas
[1:30:14] amen
[1:30:15] they are spot in your feast of charity
[1:30:18] because the holy spirit brings love of
[1:30:20] god in your heart
[1:30:21] that's what the scriptures say when they
[1:30:24] feast with you when they are in church
[1:30:26] with you
[1:30:27] feeding themselves without fear there is
[1:30:29] no respect they don't care about who you
[1:30:32] are whether you are christian or not
[1:30:34] they behave any kind of way that's why
[1:30:36] paul say many are sick and many are
[1:30:39] afflicted because they're not discerning
[1:30:41] the body of the lord the body of the
[1:30:44] lord is not a warfare of communion the
[1:30:47] body of the lord is the bride of jesus
[1:30:49] christ which is the church of the living
[1:30:52] god amen
[1:30:53] they are cloud they are without water
[1:30:57] the bible didn't say cloud without rain
[1:31:04] check your scripture
[1:31:05] the bible say cloud without water
[1:31:08] when we talk about cloud we usually talk
[1:31:11] about rain
[1:31:12] but the bible is specific and say it's
[1:31:15] cloud without water and we know water
[1:31:18] represents water
[1:31:20] it represents the world by the washing
[1:31:23] of the water by the
[1:31:25] word amen
[1:31:26] jesus told nicodemus except a man be
[1:31:29] born of water
[1:31:31] of water and water and the spirit the
[1:31:34] word and the spirit which gives you the
[1:31:36] anointed word
[1:31:38] so these are clouds with that word
[1:31:42] so when you try to find a comfort among
[1:31:45] these people they don't have no word
[1:31:49] their fellowship have no word
[1:31:55] if you sit around them there is no word
[1:31:58] you cannot hear them talking about i was
[1:32:01] listening to a tape this week
[1:32:03] or i was reading something in the bible

[1:32:12] word
[1:32:14] make sure your friend have water

[1:32:21] them at work
[1:32:23] it's a cloud that have water
[1:32:25] somebody that you can fellowship with
[1:32:28] them
[1:32:28] around the world of god
[1:32:31] until when you separate yourself you
[1:32:34] learn something you go if you can
[1:32:36] depress
[1:32:37] you leaving that person charged
[1:32:40] like it was good to talk to that person
[1:32:42] i was feeling depressed i was down but
[1:32:46] when i talked to sister so and so she
[1:32:48] encourages me she gave me scripture she
[1:32:51] talked to me until the holy ghost job
[1:32:55] and we begin to pray with her
[1:32:57] cloud with water

[1:33:03] water
[1:33:05] make sure your friend
[1:33:07] your colleague your associate got water
[1:33:11] we cannot talk three hours without water
[1:33:18] everybody here
[1:33:19] that which young ruler in hell was
[1:33:22] looking for water
[1:33:24] to call his tongue
[1:33:29] everybody
[1:33:30] but they can't give it to him in hell
[1:33:33] it was too late so when i meet with you
[1:33:36] bring me water
[1:33:37] [Applause]
[1:33:43] jesus said if you give a glass of water
[1:33:48] so it's universal you don't have to have
[1:33:51] money to buy soda
[1:33:54] everybody can get water
[1:33:56] so not only water in the natural because

[1:34:59] you want to know something in the
[1:35:00] message get with them they're going to
[1:35:02] tell you everything internationally
[1:35:09] trees use water
[1:35:11] fruit to do what
[1:35:13] because there is no water
[1:35:21] fruit weather because there is no water
[1:35:23] without water
[1:35:25] twice what
[1:35:30] when you are born in this world we are
[1:35:33] born in sin
[1:35:35] shaping iniquity
[1:35:37] coming into this your world speaking
[1:35:39] water
[1:35:40] so we are dead to begin with
[1:35:44] amen but when we receive jesus christ
[1:35:47] now we are quickened from the dead
[1:35:50] but somebody is dead naturally and dead
[1:35:54] spiritually they are twice dead or
[1:35:57] double death
[1:35:58] [Applause]
[1:36:00] [Music]
[1:36:02] planted by water
[1:36:06] no life
[1:36:07] raging wave of the sea forming their own
[1:36:10] water
[1:36:11] sit down with them they only talk about
[1:36:13] themselves
[1:36:15] i think these are the these are the
[1:36:17] these are the these are the these are
[1:36:18] the these are the disadvantages
[1:36:22] amen
[1:36:23] wandering stars
[1:36:25] to whom is reserve the water the
[1:36:27] blackness and darkness for water
[1:36:30] that is the oppression everybody cares
[1:36:32] so far
[1:36:33] now when we talk about ii peter the
[1:36:37] bible says
[1:36:38] that for if god
[1:36:40] spare not the angels that sin
[1:36:43] but cuts them down to hell
[1:36:46] and delivered them into chains of
[1:36:47] darkness
[1:36:49] to be reserved unto water
[1:36:51] that is the jail everybody here
[1:36:54] verse 6 and turning the cities of sodom
[1:36:57] and gomorrah into ashes condemned them
[1:37:01] with an overthrow making them an example
[1:37:05] unto those that after should leave hell
[1:37:09] there is three things that goes with the
[1:37:12] scripture
[1:37:13] number one this scripture point out the
[1:37:17] natural
[1:37:18] life everybody clear
[1:37:21] of the seed of this of satan
[1:37:24] everybody
[1:37:26] then the second one it speaks about
[1:37:29] their origin
[1:37:32] and what happened to them
[1:37:34] ever clear
[1:37:36] when they die
[1:37:38] they go into chains
[1:37:40] of darkness
[1:37:42] to be reserved for judgment everybody
[1:37:47] and the third thing the bible is pulling
[1:37:50] the example of sodom and gomorrah
[1:37:53] to show you their faith
[1:37:57] or their destination
[1:38:01] which is speaking about their
[1:38:02] destruction
[1:38:06] everybody here
[1:38:07] from origin they had a beginning
[1:38:11] and they must have an end about here
[1:38:14] so when they come into this world
[1:38:16] they're going to be living normal just
[1:38:19] like you like the rich young ruler
[1:38:22] everybody
[1:38:23] and after that you will find out that
[1:38:25] they are going to reject the word
[1:38:27] and the reason why they are rejecting
[1:38:29] the word is not good news
[1:38:32] it is something they did already
[1:38:35] before the foundation of the world
[1:38:37] because they never stuck with michael
[1:38:39] which was crushed
[1:38:41] anybody clear
[1:38:42] so when they die they go into chains of
[1:38:45] darkness
[1:38:46] and jude is telling you that they don't
[1:38:49] stop there this is just a temporary
[1:38:52] judgment
[1:38:53] about here
[1:38:54] now jude is pulling
[1:38:56] peter and jude both are pulling the
[1:38:58] example of sodom and gomorrah to show
[1:39:02] you that a man that doesn't receive god
[1:39:06] a man that dies as a sinner
[1:39:09] he's going first into hell
[1:39:12] then later on he's going to be destroyed
[1:39:16] anybody clear
[1:39:18] so
[1:39:19] jude says the angel which kept not their
[1:39:22] first state
[1:39:23] going to origin
[1:39:25] but left their own habitation he has
[1:39:28] reserved into everlasting water
[1:39:30] under darkness unto the judgment of the
[1:39:33] great
[1:39:34] now they died they're going to hell now
[1:39:36] jude continued just like peter he said
[1:39:39] even as sodom and gomorrah and the
[1:39:42] cities about them in like manner giving
[1:39:45] themselves over to water
[1:39:48] if you fornicate
[1:39:50] you better clean up quickly
[1:39:52] because you're a candidate to hell
[1:39:55] and going after water
[1:39:58] homosexual to hell i set forth for a
[1:40:01] water
[1:40:02] example suffering the water
[1:40:05] the vengeance of eternal
[1:40:08] in other words naturally after they die
[1:40:11] then what happened at the end
[1:40:14] everybody clear so far
[1:40:15] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:40:18] let's keep climbing
[1:40:19] the bible said in the book of luke
[1:40:23] 12 that and i said unto you my friend
[1:40:27] be not afraid of them which do water
[1:40:31] so the killing of the body which is the
[1:40:34] first death here happened to everybody
[1:40:37] jesus said do not be afraid of that one
[1:40:40] that's not the problem because i am
[1:40:45] the resurrection
[1:40:47] anybody here
[1:40:48] no problem he says kill the body and
[1:40:52] after
[1:40:54] that have no more that they can do
[1:40:57] because we if you remember brother
[1:41:00] branham explained to us that the devil's
[1:41:02] power stop at death
[1:41:05] that's it anybody here so everything
[1:41:08] satan can do to you stop right here a
[1:41:12] death
[1:41:13] but what follow after death
[1:41:17] but i will forewarn you whom you shall
[1:41:20] feel
[1:41:21] feel him
[1:41:23] which after he has done what
[1:41:27] has power to cast in water
[1:41:30] so somebody after their death will be
[1:41:32] cast into hell
[1:41:35] matthew chapter 10
[1:41:37] verse 8
[1:41:39] and fear not them which killed the body
[1:41:42] everybody clear
[1:41:43] but i'm not able to kill the water so
[1:41:46] there is also a killing of the soul
[1:41:51] so when you die your soul is not dead
[1:41:54] yet
[1:41:55] your soul is still alive
[1:41:57] and you're going to go somewhere
[1:41:59] depending on your life right here
[1:42:02] which is based upon your origin
[1:42:04] everybody clear but there will come a
[1:42:07] time that they're going to destroy a
[1:42:09] soul
[1:42:10] [Music]
[1:42:11] everybody
[1:42:12] but rather feel him which is able to do
[1:42:16] water
[1:42:18] to destroy both water
[1:42:20] and the water
[1:42:21] in water
[1:42:23] question does the body goes to hell
[1:42:30] did the body of the witch young mullet
[1:42:32] went to hell
[1:42:34] that hell is not here
[1:42:39] okay
[1:42:41] if you look at a different translation
[1:42:43] brother michael
[1:42:44] it is called water
[1:42:46] it's called gehenna
[1:42:49] which is speaking of the lake of fire
[1:42:53] everybody here
[1:42:55] hell only received the soul
[1:42:58] and the spirit
[1:43:00] not the body
[1:43:02] but the lake of fire received both
[1:43:07] are we
[1:43:08] okay stay alert we're moving up
[1:43:11] everybody here
[1:43:14] the bible said job say
[1:43:16] my flesh is clothed with worm
[1:43:20] put your seat belt
[1:43:22] and
[1:43:23] of dust
[1:43:25] my skin is broken and become lovesome
[1:43:28] job 19 he said and go after my
[1:43:33] skin worm
[1:43:35] not somebody else chemo
[1:43:37] anybody
[1:43:38] so the body that we have here
[1:43:41] job is saying that they are made of
[1:43:44] worms
[1:43:47] anybody clear
[1:43:49] that's why job called them my skin worms
[1:43:54] in other words you have yours
[1:43:57] i have mine
[1:43:59] that's why it's yours and it's mine it
[1:44:02] belongs to you anybody
[1:44:06] my skin once destroy water
[1:44:09] so the skin worm only destroys the body
[1:44:14] not the soul

[1:47:13] because at death
[1:47:15] we are gonna receive the same
[1:47:17] [Applause]
[1:47:20] treatment everybody clear
[1:47:23] those skin worms
[1:47:25] my skin won't destroy me my flesh yet in
[1:47:28] my flesh i shall see water
[1:47:32] these skin rooms
[1:47:35] have a beginning
[1:47:39] and they also have an end
[1:47:43] everybody clear
[1:47:44] the skin worm is a nodal destruction
[1:47:48] software
[1:47:50] that is loaded in your body
[1:47:53] when you are born
[1:47:55] that's after your time is finishing this
[1:47:57] earth
[1:47:58] because your body came from the earth
[1:48:01] the skin one man activated they destroy
[1:48:04] everything and when they finish they
[1:48:07] themselves die
[1:48:08] [Music]
[1:48:12] it's a software
[1:48:14] but i'm gonna show you how you block
[1:48:16] that software
[1:48:18] there is a way to block that software
[1:48:24] and it will never be activated
[1:48:26] [Applause]
[1:48:28] you gonna know about it only on the
[1:48:31] court
[1:48:32] but you will never experience it
[1:48:35] because not everybody will die
[1:48:37] [Applause]
[1:48:42] everybody here so somebody have a
[1:48:45] software
[1:48:46] but they have a manager password
[1:48:53] that they can bypass the software
[1:48:56] [Applause]
[1:48:58] [Music]
[1:48:59] i hope you're getting what i'm saying
[1:49:02] who's not using a computer here
[1:49:05] praise be the name of the lord
[1:49:07] everybody here so this skin worm had a
[1:49:11] beginning and they also have an end
[1:49:14] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:49:16] hallelujah the bible says
[1:49:19] in colossians
[1:49:20] that having made peace
[1:49:23] through the blood of his cross
[1:49:26] by him to reconcile water
[1:49:30] unto himself
[1:49:32] by he must say whether there be things
[1:49:35] on thee
[1:49:36] or things water
[1:49:38] anybody here
[1:49:40] therefore being justified by water
[1:49:44] remember they sent the resting patient
[1:49:47] those that have the faith in jesus
[1:49:48] christ you remember being justified by
[1:49:52] water
[1:49:53] we have water
[1:49:54] peace with god through our water
[1:49:57] so when you receive christ in your life
[1:50:02] everybody
[1:50:04] you
[1:50:04] technically receive peace
[1:50:08] and rest to your soul
[1:50:11] do you follow me
[1:50:13] do you follow me
[1:50:15] if you die
[1:50:17] are you following me
[1:50:19] the skin worm will be activated
[1:50:22] to destroy your body only
[1:50:26] ever here but your soul is preserved
[1:50:30] into god
[1:50:32] never to be destroyed again
[1:50:37] hallelujah
[1:50:39] matthew 11
[1:50:40] take my yoke upon you
[1:50:43] and learn of me for i am meek and lonely
[1:50:46] in heart and you shall find water
[1:50:49] for your water
[1:50:51] why do you need rest for your soul
[1:50:54] i thought you want to rest also in the
[1:50:56] body
[1:50:58] everybody here but christ is talking
[1:51:00] about the rest of the soul
[1:51:06] what is wrong with this rest of the soul
[1:51:09] watch it ever clear
[1:51:11] that's why the scripture says
[1:51:13] precious in the sight of what
[1:51:16] not in your sight because we're grieving
[1:51:20] unless you have the revelation or the
[1:51:23] mind of christ
[1:51:25] precious in the sight of the lord is the
[1:51:27] death of water
[1:51:29] because the saints have made peace with
[1:51:32] god
[1:51:34] so when you die the god of peace is
[1:51:37] waiting for you at the river
[1:51:40] when you crossing that river
[1:51:43] he's picking you up
[1:51:45] say come home little child
[1:51:48] come home heal the children
[1:51:51] and when you look you're gonna remember
[1:51:53] you say oh i see songs over there
[1:51:56] and they are cheering you like come on
[1:51:58] you made it
[1:52:01] [Applause]
[1:52:03] why because you made peace with god
[1:52:06] [Applause]
[1:52:08] hallelujah
[1:52:09] blessed be the name of the lord now the
[1:52:12] word death means water
[1:52:15] when we die this way
[1:52:17] our physical death does not mean that we
[1:52:20] are dead
[1:52:22] jesus said he thou do what
[1:52:25] do you wear water
[1:52:27] yet you shall water who serve and live
[1:52:30] and believe from me shall never
[1:52:33] that death speaking of here is water
[1:52:36] from the presence of water but the
[1:52:39] physical death that we have to go
[1:52:41] through here yet it is not death
[1:52:46] we are still in the presence of whom
[1:52:49] we move from this place to a water
[1:52:54] to water
[1:52:55] in his water so sister jean is more
[1:52:59] closer to god than you
[1:53:06] hallelujah
[1:53:08] it is not the death that we call death
[1:53:11] what we call it here remember he says
[1:53:13] the girl that died giulia's daughter
[1:53:15] she's not
[1:53:17] but water
[1:53:18] everybody clear so far
[1:53:20] this doesn't happen to everybody
[1:53:24] tighten up now you see the christian
[1:53:28] when he dies he goes water
[1:53:32] under the altar of god right into the
[1:53:35] presence of who
[1:53:36] under the altair he is a dwarter because
[1:53:40] he made peace with god
[1:53:42] and if you have not made peace with god
[1:53:45] in this church
[1:53:46] make sure you make peace today
[1:53:49] because you don't know what's going to
[1:53:51] happen next
[1:53:55] you ready
[1:53:56] let's switch
[1:54:00] you understand what happened to the
[1:54:02] christian
[1:54:03] check
[1:54:04] what happened to the sinner
[1:54:06] you ready
[1:54:08] to break it down
[1:54:10] when a man has a nightmare
[1:54:12] he's not all together what
[1:54:15] neither you see what
[1:54:17] but the bottom is using two terminology
[1:54:21] one asleep can i get this
[1:54:25] one asleep
[1:54:26] and another one awake
[1:54:31] we have a sleep
[1:54:33] and
[1:54:35] awake
[1:54:36] anybody care
[1:54:38] who sleeps
[1:54:40] who is awake
[1:54:44] you ready
[1:54:46] he is between water
[1:54:48] and what
[1:54:50] so brother branham is saying
[1:54:52] when you are sleeping it's okay
[1:54:56] when you are awake it's okay
[1:54:58] the problem is when you are in between
[1:55:01] sleep
[1:55:02] and awake right here
[1:55:05] that's your problem
[1:55:07] why is it a problem
[1:55:09] brother problem say
[1:55:11] he is between sleep and awake
[1:55:14] and that is what makes makes him have a
[1:55:17] water
[1:55:19] a horrible shaking and screaming
[1:55:22] because he's not asleep
[1:55:24] about here
[1:55:25] he's not water
[1:55:30] so when you are not sleeping
[1:55:33] neither are you at work
[1:55:35] you drop in a nightmare
[1:55:41] what does it mean
[1:55:43] hallelujah
[1:55:46] and to take that that example
[1:55:49] shows where
[1:55:51] a man goes when he died unconverted
[1:55:55] [Music]
[1:55:56] he's he's leave his time up
[1:56:01] he's dead on what
[1:56:03] and he cannot go into the presence of
[1:56:06] who
[1:56:07] because he's not fit to go there without
[1:56:10] the
[1:56:11] and he is what
[1:56:13] he's caught and he cannot come back to
[1:56:15] the earth
[1:56:16] because his time is finished here on
[1:56:19] earth and he's cut between he's in the
[1:56:23] water
[1:56:25] a man that is a work is a man that is
[1:56:28] living yet
[1:56:30] a man that slippeth is a christian that
[1:56:34] have died
[1:56:37] amen
[1:56:38] when a sinner dies
[1:56:40] his time of living is finished
[1:56:44] but here
[1:56:45] he cannot go back to the presence of god
[1:56:48] by sleeping that's why jesus said
[1:56:50] lazarus is not dead but he does water
[1:56:53] because christians sleep but sinners
[1:56:57] stay between sleep
[1:57:00] where the christian is and they work
[1:57:03] where the people are still living on the
[1:57:04] earth they are caught between
[1:57:07] and they live in a nightmare which is
[1:57:09] called the fifth dimension
[1:57:13] that's why when a sinner is about to die
[1:57:16] they begin to scream
[1:57:18] i'm lost i'm lost i'm lost i'm lost i'm
[1:57:20] lost because his time is finished here
[1:57:24] he can't go into the presence of the
[1:57:25] lord then he's caught
[1:57:28] that catching
[1:57:29] of that sinner is he's just telling you
[1:57:32] he just enter another dimension
[1:57:36] everybody he cannot come back to the
[1:57:39] earth because his time is finishing on
[1:57:41] earth and he's cut between and he's in a
[1:57:45] nightmare he can't go in the presence of
[1:57:47] god to do what
[1:57:49] because he never made peace with god
[1:57:53] ever here and he can come back to the
[1:57:55] earth because his time is up he's in a
[1:57:59] nightmare
[1:58:00] and there he stays until the day of
[1:58:04] water
[1:58:05] a horrible thing to be in
[1:58:09] the chain of darkness
[1:58:12] it's a nightmare
[1:58:14] a place without order
[1:58:16] a horrible place that even demon
[1:58:19] themselves they don't want to go there
[1:58:21] don't let that be to us
[1:58:24] this is our visitation time let's
[1:58:27] remember christ that he's the same
[1:58:30] yesterday today and forever
[1:58:32] hebrew 38 don't wait till
[1:58:36] some regency under
[1:58:38] amen
[1:58:39] in the damn
[1:58:40] in the dimension where you cannot go in
[1:58:43] the presence of god and your time is up
[1:58:46] on the earth in the nightmare of horror
[1:58:50] you shall remember you had your
[1:58:52] opportunity and turn it away
[1:58:55] let the young people take notice to this
[1:58:58] let all take notice to this make sure
[1:59:03] you have peace with god
[1:59:05] so when you die if it happened to you
[1:59:08] are you doing you are sleeping that's
[1:59:11] why christians die peacefully because
[1:59:14] god rocked them slowly because he took
[1:59:17] the sting of death away and you go out
[1:59:20] slowly if you don't have peace with god
[1:59:23] you're gonna be caught into the fifth
[1:59:25] dimension screaming forever until we
[1:59:28] come and deal with you and the white
[1:59:30] throne judgment everybody clear so far
[1:59:34] why did you talk about all these worms
[1:59:36] and stuff
[1:59:37] mark 9 verse 43 we're talking about the
[1:59:40] sinner and if the hand of fendi do what
[1:59:46] it is better for thee to enter into life
[1:59:48] maimed
[1:59:50] than having water
[1:59:52] to go into water
[1:59:58] into the water
[2:00:00] the nerve shall be water so hell got
[2:00:03] fire
[2:00:06] everybody here
[2:00:07] hair contained fire
[2:00:10] what else contained hell
[2:00:12] where there water

[2:00:24] don't want you to say he he he was the
[2:00:27] one that put it up there so his bible is
[2:00:29] different than my bible open your bible
[2:00:37] i thought the worm
[2:00:39] had a beginning
[2:00:41] and they also have an end
[2:00:43] when they finish their job
[2:00:45] the software have auto destruction they
[2:00:47] destroy and they destroy also themselves
[2:00:50] in other words they kamikaze themselves
[2:00:57] everybody here
[2:00:59] they can't go without finishing with you
[2:01:01] they finish you then they finish
[2:01:03] themselves
[2:01:04] and everybody i mean everything is dust
[2:01:06] back again
[2:01:08] go mark man
[2:01:09] can we read it together
[2:01:11] okay if the hand of fendi cut it off
[2:01:15] it is better for d to enter into life
[2:01:18] maim without that finger that click
[2:01:21] pornography than having two hands
[2:01:24] to go into water
[2:01:26] into the
[2:01:28] we got fire in the hell that never shall
[2:01:30] be
[2:01:31] 44 where the water
[2:01:34] is he written like that on your bible so
[2:01:36] we got warm in hell
[2:01:41] worm
[2:01:43] job said they are built in your body
[2:01:46] everybody
[2:01:47] you have them that's why job said
[2:01:49] masking worm
[2:01:51] and when they destroy you they also
[2:01:53] destroy themselves
[2:01:55] but right here jesus is talking about
[2:01:58] different worms
[2:02:01] and jesus also say
[2:02:04] dare worm
[2:02:05] [Music]
[2:02:09] anybody care

[2:02:30] also
[2:02:31] have a different type of your worm
[2:02:38] am i reading a different bubble
[2:02:40] tighten up
[2:02:42] everybody here where the worm diet dieth
[2:02:45] not because they're dealing with the
[2:02:47] soul and the spirit
[2:02:49] and the fire is not water
[2:02:53] isaiah 66
[2:02:55] and they shall go forth and look upon
[2:02:58] the water of the men that have done what
[2:03:02] transgress against me for they
[2:03:06] shall not water
[2:03:07] neither shall there
[2:03:09] be water and there shall be enough
[2:03:12] boring unto all flesh
[2:03:16] what is going on the sinners in zion are
[2:03:20] afraid
[2:03:21] the people that are in the message
[2:03:23] playing around they are afraid
[2:03:25] fearfulness
[2:03:27] has to pass the water
[2:03:29] don't waste your time being a hypocrite
[2:03:32] you're going to pay a lot of
[2:03:35] and suffer a lot
[2:03:36] just be genuine
[2:03:38] who among us shall dwell with the
[2:03:40] devourer fire who among us shall do with
[2:03:44] everlasting burning
[2:03:46] we know our god is a consuming fire
[2:03:49] who can dwell with god
[2:03:51] now we found out that the worm are in
[2:03:53] hell and the worm in hell don't die but
[2:03:57] what goes in hell is not the body it is
[2:04:00] the soul
[2:04:02] that goes to hell
[2:04:06] what is that worm
[2:04:07] that you have
[2:04:10] anybody clear
[2:04:12] you ready
[2:04:15] jesus in matthew 24 say
[2:04:18] as the death speak jesus stood himself
[2:04:21] in the midst of them after the
[2:04:23] resurrection and say unto them peace be
[2:04:26] unto you but they were terrified and
[2:04:29] frightened and supposed that they had
[2:04:31] seen water
[2:04:32] when they saw jesus resurrected they
[2:04:34] said are you already dead this is a
[2:04:36] ghost this is a spirit
[2:04:39] jesus taught them it is me i am body
[2:04:41] they say
[2:04:42] you are a spirit
[2:04:44] and he said unto them why are you
[2:04:46] troubled and why do your thoughts arise
[2:04:49] in your heart behold my hand and my feet
[2:04:53] that is i i myself handle me and see for
[2:04:56] a water
[2:04:58] has not water
[2:05:00] and not water so if a worm is in hell
[2:05:03] what are they eating
[2:05:07] because what goes in hell is a spirit
[2:05:10] in the body they're eating up their body
[2:05:13] in hell what are they eating
[2:05:20] as you see me and when he has that
[2:05:23] spoken he showed them his hand and his
[2:05:26] feet and while they yet believe not for
[2:05:29] joy and wonder a mixture he said unto
[2:05:33] them have ye hear meat any meat and they
[2:05:36] gave him a piece of boiled fish and of
[2:05:38] honeycomb and he took it and did it
[2:05:42] and me no

[2:25:19] somebody tell you the guy is burning
[2:25:22] hell now that is wrong
[2:25:25] a judge of this earth is just enough to
[2:25:28] never condemn a man until he's brought
[2:25:30] to water
[2:25:31] and god will never throw a man into a
[2:25:34] fire furnace until he first is water
[2:25:37] condemned by god's own law he rejected
[2:25:41] mercy so you see he first has to have a
[2:25:44] trial and the trial is the great white
[2:25:47] throne but now he's in the place called
[2:25:49] water

[2:26:20] i already asked you forgiveness
[2:26:22] what else

[2:26:26] he begins to torment him
[2:26:29] you go there you start washing dishes
[2:26:31] yeah yeah that's why that's why every
[2:26:34] day since i start this marriage and then

[2:43:24] for your love and for your mercy
[2:43:26] father thank you for opening the way of
[2:43:29] redemption
[2:43:30] that the chasm that was between the very
[2:43:33] gulf that was separating you from us
[2:43:36] lord
[2:43:37] you came down and you breach it lord
[2:43:39] and now man can live now from this earth
[2:43:43] no more to go down to paradise but to go
[2:43:46] straight into that presence where our
[2:43:49] precious sister is now sitting lord
[2:43:52] father
[2:43:54] we still have our time here
[2:43:56] we don't know who's going to stay
[2:43:59] we don't know who's going to be next
[2:44:01] but we know one thing that if we can
[2:44:03] make peace with you
[2:44:05] we don't care what's going to happen on
[2:44:07] tomorrow because we know that the end
[2:44:10] not only are we going to stay in your
[2:44:12] presence but we will come back again
[2:44:14] and to live on this earth in the same
[2:44:16] body that we left off
[2:44:18] father you're going to pull all those
[2:44:20] adam together
[2:44:21] and that one will never have a software
[2:44:24] of auto destruction
[2:44:25] because that one will stay forever
[2:44:28] lord
[2:44:30] you spoke to your children
[2:44:32] about their associate
[2:44:35] where they want to make sure they stay
[2:44:37] with friends
[2:44:38] with people
[2:44:39] where they can fellowship
[2:44:41] around the things of the world
[2:44:44] father around clouds that have water
[2:44:47] and if they have one that doesn't have
[2:44:49] water
[2:44:50] may they be that cloud of water that can
[2:44:53] be the one giving water to somebody else
[2:44:57] because this earth the people are
[2:44:59] thirsting like a dry land father they're
[2:45:02] looking for water to change lord father
[2:45:04] the ground
[2:45:06] oh god if there is some that slack on
[2:45:09] little point here and there about the
[2:45:12] christian life
[2:45:13] maybe that soul was speaking saying it's
[2:45:16] time to pray
[2:45:18] but that movie is still pulling
[2:45:20] maybe father that soul was saying
[2:45:22] remember we got service tomorrow but
[2:45:25] it's that friend that is calling that
[2:45:27] party that uh uh or going out that this
[2:45:31] and that
[2:45:32] something is stepping between them
[2:45:34] trying to block their growth and their
[2:45:36] christian life lord until further the
[2:45:39] the
[2:45:40] the voice of the soul becomes so dim
[2:45:44] and they can't even hear it no more
[2:45:46] lord may you be merciful as they're
[2:45:49] still holding the breath of life
[2:45:51] and father the thread of life has been
[2:45:53] catched yet that they can be awakened
[2:45:57] by the power of the holy spirit
[2:45:59] and check and realize and examine their
[2:46:01] life to make sure they in line with you
[2:46:04] lord
[2:46:05] father many times we are driven our life
[2:46:07] with our brain
[2:46:09] with what we think we acquire we acquire
[2:46:11] in school
[2:46:12] with our knowledge
[2:46:14] with our personality what society
[2:46:17] breathed and built into us
[2:46:19] and we thought that was the man that can
[2:46:22] accomplish something in this world and
[2:46:24] father many times we find ourselves in
[2:46:27] total failure where we beat against the
[2:46:29] wall but you never leave us you come
[2:46:32] always on time to show us that i'm
[2:46:34] always there if you can let me have your
[2:46:37] life i can take you into depth that
[2:46:39] you've never seen before and father if
[2:46:42] there is anybody here that is still
[2:46:44] struggling with their life they have not
[2:46:46] made peace with you that are still
[2:46:49] living a life of a hypocrite that are
[2:46:51] still going to church in a religious way
[2:46:54] where when they leave to church they
[2:46:55] live any kind of way and they can make a
[2:46:58] difference between them and the true
[2:47:00] christian where people never even desire
[2:47:03] to be like them because of their
[2:47:05] behavior and the way they portray
[2:47:07] themselves
[2:47:08] father may you come and open up to them
[2:47:11] a special revelation that they can take
[2:47:13] their life lord and surrender completely
[2:47:16] their life and make peace with you
[2:47:19] because you came and you opened up the
[2:47:20] way lord the veil of the temple was
[2:47:23] turned into a lord so that man can now
[2:47:26] get access lord father to the holy of
[2:47:29] the holiest lord when he was in the old
[2:47:31] testament nobody could enter that place
[2:47:34] lord only one who was chosen who was the
[2:47:37] high priest lord and that was just a
[2:47:39] figure under the levitical priesthood
[2:47:41] lord that there is another priesthood
[2:47:43] that was coming on the melchizedek lord
[2:47:46] and that priesthood open up the way that
[2:47:49] everybody can get into your presence
[2:47:51] where our soul can be ignited by the
[2:47:54] holy spirit lord and when we happen to
[2:47:57] leave this earth lord
[2:47:58] never to be destroyed never to be lord
[2:48:01] father remanded of lord all those horror
[2:48:05] all those horrible things that we were
[2:48:07] doing in the earth lord but we're gonna
[2:48:09] be reminded of those sermons and when we
[2:48:12] look up we say we remember when we were
[2:48:15] in the earth they were telling us about
[2:48:17] the sixth dimension they were telling us
