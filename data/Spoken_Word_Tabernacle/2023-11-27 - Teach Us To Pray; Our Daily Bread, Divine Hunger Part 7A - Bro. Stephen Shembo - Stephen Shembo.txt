Zach would like to give a testimony this morning if that's okay um we got a little clip of a video we want to show you as well amen oh happy birthday amen sister f amen God bless PR the Lord so I'm sure some of you might know that me and Lily re we recently moved this week up here to North Carolina there's a few things that led up to this happening um a lot of lot of prayer and uh but but God has just been moving in our lives really for the past year uh since we got married I just wanted to uh put before the Lord like my job and uh the church where we you know because I wanted I wanted to be in the will of the Lord and everything that I was doing so I just really went before the Lord and was praying God just direct me I want to be in your perfect will I want to be at the church you want me to go to whether it's the church that I grew up in because you know um been there my whole life I had a lot of you know faith in the ministry there and everything but I was like wherever you need me to be I just want to be there so um I was praying that you know uh I wanted to get into a trade and that was kind of like my my goal at the time is I wanted to I Really at the time I was thinking electrical or HVAC and so I was looking into opportunities for that and I was looking into um opportunities around the area where where we're living in Georgia but uh my brother-in-law who lives in South Carolina he works in HVAC in Buford and he offered he uh talked to his boss and he was like we could get you an opportunity up here where where we live and get you working up here so I was like well Lord you know this is what I've been praying about maybe this is where maybe this is the opportunity that you're putting in my lap so I talked to the guy and you know he's a brother in the church really really great guy and uh so he sent me an offer letter and I uh I um went you know went ahead and applied and everything and started I was like as soon as I can find a place to live then I uh will move over there and I'll start working so started looking for places to live and nothing was working out just we found this apartment complex that looked promising that didn't well it didn't work out that fell through it was just one thing after another just wasn't working out um so I just kept praying like Lord you know I thought this was I F I felt led like this is what we were supposed to do and you know I trying to line up the three lights that brother brandom said to do when we when you're seeking the will of the Lord so I was like well you know it doesn't seem like those lights are lining up perfectly so time to get back to praying again so I went back I was at work one day and I was like Lord this isn't working out just tell show me what you need to do I'm just put it in your hands I'm just keep doing what I'm doing I'm going just keep living how I've been living you know and so we came and visited here uh sometime mid October and uh Lily's parents were talking about us moving up here and I was like you know I really hadn't put much thought into it because you know I didn't have a job up here I was like where would I work you know what what uh opportunity would I would I be able to take on so um I just that night I just went into a room alone and I was just praying and I was like Lord if this is your will then just speak to your brother Steven tomorrow and little dead I know Lily was in the other room speaking or not speaking uh praying the same thing so at the same time we were praying that and I was like Lord you know I know you've spoke to me many times before through brother Stephen directly to him so I was like I know that I'll get my answer um so I just put it before him like that so the next day we came into church and uh brother stepen came out and I don't know if you want to play the video what he said a blessing for you zacha so you but by God's grace you welcome to spoken word Tabernacle and we trust it's going to be a blessing for you zacha saw you it's time to move [Applause] northward wait a minute brother Sten brother Steven after he says that he looks at everybody and he goes just chill out this is between Zach and I he didn't know what he was saying but by God's grace you [Applause] welcome then after part of the service after that he actually um he confirmed it twice by also reading the scripture after which was Deuteronomy uh chapter 2 verse two which was you've Compass this mountain long enough turn you northward so I was like wow so Lily looked at me and she was crying I started crying I was like that's not a confirmation I don't know what is so I went home and I was like well that sounds like a direct answer to what I was praying for Lord but you need to give me a job too and I know that's your will then of course you'll give me a job so that same week the end of that same exact week I had applied to a few different places and uh I got a call from uh this company in Gastonia as an HVAC company and the position that I applied for wasn't the exact position that I wanted but I was like maybe I can get in the company and and everything but after talking to me on the phone they were like you know you sound like you would be a really good technician was that what you and that's exactly what I wanted to do so I was like Lord You're just provide me got everything I need that was a confirmation there of course we have a place to live and everything God's just provided everything we've had need of so just amen so y'all can imagine how I feel about this Thanksgiving I got you know Chris and Rebecca have been a major blessing in our Liv since since uh he come up here a couple of years ago and uh and now we've got our our youngest children now Jeffrey's close by we'll see him here one day I hope he's and I hope he's watching this cuz I'm speaking it amen all right thank you Jesus so I do have a couple of prayer requests here we won't prolong anything we just we just felt like that was pretty major for this time of season amen um sister Destiny texted me from Florida a while ago and said little Ariana is has been having a high fever while they're down there and they're having a little bit of difficulty trying to keep it maintained without giving her medicine but you know they're they're just trying to do that also um you didn't ask me to mention this but Zach um is missing his wallet it's got his Georgia driver's license it had a little bit of cash it's got some other stuff in it you know we've been praying but we might need we might need a little help you know and I know who to bring it to right so together we can bring it to God and it and it'll show up it might even show up in his pocket while we're sitting here you know so yeah that ain't hard to believe is it amen so let's stand I'm going to ask brother Charles to pray if he doesn't mind and then we're going to have a special and bring our pastor out amen thank you amen let us pray Heavenly Father we thank you Lord God for this time of Thanksgiving Lord God we know Lord God that every day is a Thanksgiving unto us Lord God because we get to see you Lord God and and when we see you father we

there was a season Lord God that where several of our brothers Lord God lost their keys a while ago Lord God and Lord every one of them heavenly father found their keys in a supernatural way and father if you have done it then Lord God you can do it now now Lord God father we claim Lord God that his wallet will be Lord God in a place that he did not expect it to be father that he may give you more honor more praise and more Glory heavenly father that you have done this thing Lord God that it was no man Heavenly Father Lord God we pray Lord God for the tithes and the offerings Lord God Lord

both visible and invisible audience I trust everybody had a nice Thanksgiving amen a lot of food a lot of Fellowship so you relax and everything amen and ready for the spiritual food amen amen glory to God every family members here we do not have visitors every family member God richly bless you and uh sister Lily welcome welcome welcome and brother Zach welcome to spoken word Tabernacle I believe everybody is up to date with the sermon and I believe each one of you we are reading our Bible twice a day one chapter in the morning one chapter before we go to bed summer reading the church ages 70 weeks of Daniel the seals adoption what else again and the message of the hour some amen because our conversation should be all about the word amen amen if you do one day without talking about Jesus that's a problem right amen because he is the word amen we talked about the prophet because the messenger and the message I want so when we say brother Bram say actually we not really talking about brother Bram we are talking about the message that brother brandham brought but it's hard to separate the message from its messenger so when you quote my name you only quote my name if I'm talking about the word everybody okay so when you say brother Steven you say brother Steven say that brother Bram say that the Bible say then my name can be associated in other words my name doesn't have to be associated every day but Jesus name have to be Associated every day the message of the hour every day so we talk about the word every single day we talk about brother Charles if he spoke something that concerned the word of God then his name could be Associated but not really talking about him it's talking about the Revelation that the Lord put into him are we clear amen so let's spend our time reading the word listening to the word and talking about the word am do not go one day without talking about the word am because he is the word we clear so far amen glory to God December 2nd that will be the young Sisters Meeting and the venue is already confirmed sister Devon I believe you already sent the message not yet okay you go ahead and send the message so everybody knows where the venue is It's a Wonderful venue it's a prefer venue for the young sister so you know what it means amen so the venue is already confirmed I will still wait for brother abble because of the conflict of the date to make sure for the youngst men meeting and December the 23rd this is when we have our question and answer and Lord's willing I'll take maybe 15 minute give the trustee a little bit the minute so he can present uh what we have in the building fund and then from there just give more clarification where we are as far as the building fund so and uh and the building project so if you have any question make sure you're there and the Lord will uh answer your question not me but the Lord will answer your question amen I had a question based on what I spoke last Sunday a mention uh that Adam was the only one that didn't have a belly button amen you remember that amen you remember that and somebody asked a question and send a question say Eve also did not have a belly button right so when the person sent me the message he just opened me up like who I say well I was more emphasizing on Adam and here I missed Eve so since he was spoken on the pulpit he have to be corrected back on the pulpit everybody okay and when I say corrected back the Holy Spirit drop a scripture say Eve also was called Adam exactly right I'm just repeating what happened to me amen when I say I'm going to correct and I'm going to say Eve the Holy Spirit drum a scripture say but Eve was called Adam can you say amen amen don't worry let me give you the scripture so that works out amen the Bible says in Genesis chapter 5 verse 1 and two that this is the book of the generation of who Adam in the day that God created who man in the likeness of God made he him how male and female created he them and God did what blessed them and called their name what Adam so when you say Adam it's a name for a male and a female amen everybody okay so if Adam didn't have a belly button what do you think Eve what do you think they can't what do you think the answer should be no belly Buton because whatever speak of the groom also speak of what but let me help you up so you don't say brother Steven say you say brother Bram says brother Bram they ask him a question uh this is the key to the door in paragraph 123 he say someone asked the other day he said brother BR would there be any difference between who Adam and Eve even though we know Adam and Eve both of them are called Adam amen and their children today if they were all naked walking would their bodies be the same so the question is about the body of Adam and Eve brother brandham say I say no sir in other words there was a difference between the body of Adam and Eve and our body we would like to know what is the difference brother Bram say we was coming home from squirrel hunting brother Fred and I and a bunch of them I say no they would not be the same Amen brother brandham help me more give me the difference say you mean Eve would not be a woman like her daughters and Adam would not be a man like his son I said in many respect but not in all physical aspect respect he said what will be the difference uhuh I said what they wouldn't have they not Adam they both Adam and Eve they would not have what any naal So Adam did not have a naal evil also did not have an evil why William Marion Bram they were how created right they was not attached to what nothing in other word they didn't have a mama as long as they bear there on everything that is born in the world in in this world sure it's a renegade to begin with because we're born in sin that's right I said sure there is a difference they would not have no nille they was not connected to any what female to come how here God did what created them so who didn't have a belly Buton Adam and Eve any question Adam did not have a belly button male and female no belly button because they were they never came out from a woman they came straight from God and they were created is that clear enough we clear so let's go to our scripture [Laughter] then I love the message of the hour good to see you my brother welcome again to spoken word you will need your Bible amen glory glory brother you greet Ark for me he's online I saw him online Genesis chapter 3 verse 17 if you dare you can say Amen before I move there let me remind you this so we understand how we moving on in Genesis 29 verse one uh chapter 1 verse 29 we showed you clearly the diet of a man you remember that and the Bible say God said behold I have given you every herb bearing what seeds so man was eating seeds amen amen that that's why we have peanut and all kind of stuff it's seed there's nothing wrong you good by the word to eat seeds so please don't start okay Genesis 29 it's the diet the human diet the human diet was what seed herb bearing every seed so you get the seed you eat amen which is I will shock somebody today a little bit which is upon the face of the Earth and every tree in the which is the fruit of the tree yielding what seed so man was eating seed and fruits and those fruits must have seed in it so when you eat you get the seed you put it back again and then we can have more fruit Amen to you it shall be water me so that was the diet of man and in verse 30 it was the diet of the animal kingdom or bird kingdom whatever you call it amen amen what was the diet and to every beast of the earth and to every F of the air and to everything that creepeth upon the Earth wherein there is life I have given water every green herb for meat every green herb so so if it's not green I don't know every Green her amen for food amen we clear there now let's go to Genesis 17 now you understand how we're climing glory to God you there verse 17 and to Adam he said because you have hearkened to the voice of your wife we went through this and have eaten of the tree of which I commanded you saying you shall not eat of the of it curse is the ground we clear the ground now is cursed curse is the ground for your sake in other word instead of cursing you I'm cursing the ground everybody okay but the food was coming from the ground the tree was bringing food from the ground and the herb were bringing food from the AR uh I mean uh from the Earth now the ground is cursed Amen in sorrow shall you eat so man was not eating in sorrow sir this is after the fall you might be seated so I can load this pretty good amen amen amen amen man was not eating in sorrow man was eating happily amen but God now introduced sorrow amen he says in sorrow shall you eat of it all the days of your what life so the meat of man is now mingle with suffering everybody okay it was God Who provided it everything was free now there is suffering connected to it Verse 18 thorns and Thorn also and fistle shall he bring forth to you and you shall eat the what herb of the field stop in Genesis 29 before the fall man was eating what seed and what fruit now God upgrade the diet now Man became a vegetarian is there is my Bible different than yours men can eat salad yes after the fall is that a problem which version of the Bible do you have my friend so the diet is upgrade now men can eat what now the human diet man now can eat herb amen you can eat herb grass amen you shall eat herb of the field verse 19 in the sweat of your face shall you eat what bread the first time bread is mentioned in the scripture we clear so bread food was given to men without any sweat that's right amen because it was all provided by God but according to Genesis 3:19 it looks like man now is responsible to work and to sweat for his own food so the responsibility kind of move from God to man are we together you need to stay up so in Genesis chapter 3 verse 19 it seems like man now is responsible amen amen for his own food amen for he's bread amen and he has to sweat it up Amen in other word when man have food he can brag can I in in Genesis man was not working man was just walking around and look at the tree get the food eat and move on no work amen there is nothing for men to brag in Genesis chapter 1 man was dependent amen totally from God but in Genesis 3:19 it looks like men now can work work work work and when he get food man can say I need to eat my food I work for it I need to eat my money yeah I swe it out I was there clocking in clocking I cannot sit I'm all the way standing this is my money I need to eat it take time take time why I was there outside cutting the grass myself and they pay me it is my money it looks like man become self-existent can I continue can I continue Have I Lost somebody so man now seems to be like self-sufficient by his strength what a curse let me ask you a question two choices you s you sit home I give you money hey or you come out you unload the truck and I give you money what do you want did you hear that question did you hear that ask the sister that work ask a sisters that work that try to help their husband let me put it that way that try to help their husband meet the two end of the mouth ask them if you say can we bless your husband and you sit home and you going to hear answer and even men ask men if you want to sit home and they give you money ask men she said don't answer man do you want to go you heard it amen amen that's why everybody's working to go to retirement that's why every man work hard for retirement because they want to sit at home and enjoy their mind M they don't want to work they want to go to Home Depot and buy all the fishing stuff and everything and they don't have to work just go fish are we together are we together why do people love DSS cuz you don't work why do people love food stamp you brother because you get food for free and they don't want to work because the more they work the more income they make they're going to cut out the food stamp am I saying something [Applause] different Genesis 3:19 the diet change man now can eat salad and man is responsible for his own bread and he's working he's doing everything by strength amen amen and in the sweat of your face shall you eat bread until till you return to the ground for out of it were you taken Genesis 2:7 Out of the Dust we clear amen for dust you are Genesis 2:7 you remember that and to that shall you also do what return we clear so far let's go to Genesis chapter 9 glory

amen but you know make sure the volume online is on because my monitor went off John chap 1 verse one if you dare you can say amen amen go ahead my brother in the beginning was the word is the volume on okay go ahead maybe it's my b in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God mhm the same was in the beginning with God all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made okay let's go together Amen in the beginning was the word we know what it means amen and the Word was with God we clear we understand this and the Word was who God we clear so this word is a person it's God it's the logos we understand this the same was in the beginning with God we talking about the word this is where I want you to keep all things brother Rober yes sir they change it it says all things were made by him this is what I want you to keep everything that existed all things amen everything amen came from the word amen amen in other word everything was in the word the word just brought it out are we together so the word contain everything amen everything that exists today was inside the world are we together amen Jesus verse three all things were made by him and with that what him was not what anything made that was what made in other words there is nothing that existed on Earth or outside of the earth without being made by the word amen that's it are we together so the universe came from the word the planets came from the word your tree came from the word human being came from the word amen the sky came from the word so everything that exist was from the word amen amen that's why in the beginning he was existing by himself amen that's why he was Elohim eloh there was nothing else but God and God shrank himself so that he can create space into the universe when he shrank he create a negative [Applause] pressure are we together are we together I already explained you this now you taking time amen I explained this to you this is God Amen if you go this direction it's God if you go this way it's God if you go this way it's God if you go this way it's God there is nothing No Beginning No End it's God are we together so God shrank himself are we together he shrink himself into a light if you never seen that light that's the light that is over there so so the Eternal one the one that feels all Time and Eternity become like this light right everybody okay so as he was shrinking himself everything that he was was shrink or condense or compact into that light so that light is more than light light have everything amen are we together when he shr himself he became the positive amen are you following me and all around him become negative because it's empty then from himself he begin to bring stuff out to fill in the Gap are we together that's when he begin to create the Galaxy he begin to create the planet he begin to create Mars Jupiter everything all the asteroid were coming from him so there is nothing that is here that never exist without him amen that's why brother Bram say if Albert Ain would have applied what he seen in the physical in mathematics and put it in the scripture he would have preached something amen because brother I'm say Ashan discover a center into the universe in other words Ashan discover the positive logos and Ashan say if you can get a contact with the logos then you can create [Applause] everything are we together are we together have I lost somebody you know what since I'm claming already let let's just pray because I'm already in the air amen let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we are approaching you humbly again this morning Father thanking you for your grace your love your mercy and for everything you have been doing for us father this is as far as I can go as a man with the ability of the Holy Spirit Lord may you completely take me away from this place and may you come and speak to us and bless our soul be the Alpha and the Omega father we thank you for everything in the name of Jesus Christ amen we clear we clear together listen to what Paul says Paul says this in the book of Colossians chapter one Paul say for by who him we clear were all things created amen everything that was created was created by Him if you want to create something you need to meet that light amen if you don't have anything and you want to create something you need to get in contact with the positive because in him is everything he have the blueprint he have the software he has the master he has the server of everything that existed if you ask him you say how can I make a square he can pull from his database and say this is the way you make a square are we together is it too strong glory to God Paul says for by him were all things how created that are where in heaven and where are in Earth how visible so God did that just created what you can see even the things that you cannot see were created from him in other word in him are we together in him was the visible and the invisible things all of them were compacting him so when God begin to create he was not just creating the visible things that we can see God was also creating the invisible things are we together are we together he says of things visible and what invisible where did they be what Thrones you know what it means we already went through this and what Dominion you know what it means right and what principality and what power all category of Angel was in him Amen in other word this light is a full [Music] package are we together are we together all things work created what by him and what for him we clear look to Hebrew 11:3 the Bible say through what faith revelation we do what understand so Revelation give you understanding amen hallelujah am oh this is an understanding this is just understanding Revelation give understanding people in the Mage this is just understanding this is just an understanding it's a revelation that give you understanding amen through faith we do what understand that's what the worlds were plural were what framed by what the word of God so whatever happened here was frame or manufactured by God so God was standing and making the Earth are we together he was was framed by the word of God so that the things which are what seen were not made of things that do what which do appear so this Earth that you see today started from an abstract it started from an invisible work it started from a concept in the mind of God and when God as a great architect designed the Earth he spoke it and then the Earth came to existence are we together so everything that existed in the Earth come from the water word so if you want to create you need to do what now let me ask you a question if you traveling my friend you can rent a you H track yes sir okay you have a big hous okay now you preaching the gospel you married and everything even those that have a problem with your married you get married and everything now you got children you get a family and you're trying to move just like brother Zach move there is two ways you can move everybody okay there is two ways you can move you can take a big truck and you take everything that you have on your apartment and you put it in a truck everybody okay and you take it to North Carolina or you can take everything that you have and pull back to its origin let me start it again amen this pulit was created right this Pulpit was created amen this pit came from somewhere else if I take this pullit and pull it back where he was I don't have to carry the pulpit somebody's struggling let me help you up clearly okay how did we get this chair we did what pay for it we paid for it amen so the money we have had the chair have i l somebody the money we have had the chair inside inside the money that we have in the bank account there were chair there everybody okay so I can carry this chair and walk with it for marage and be tired or I can leave the chair and just get the money in my pocket as long as I have the money I have the chair amen are we together are we together so if all the furniture of brother Zach were $10,000 he have two option either he can carry everything and Drive slowly for 4 hours or he can get $10,000 and put it in the pocket that 10 $1,000 in the pocket have every Furniture everybody okay so if I carry $10,000 I'm more free than if I carry my bed and the mattress and the sheet and everything are we together if we want to move this church we have to carry all this chair we got to carry the pulit we need to take the light and everything but if we get the value of this church and we can get it in paper you can put this entire church in a [Applause] check everybody okay and the check can reproduce this church back again the check have the power to take this church and to move it everywhere the church can go are we together are we together so either you can have the natural things or you can have the money which have the purchase of power either you can carry the chair or you can just carry the word because in the word is everything if I have the word I can produce a [Applause] chair have i l you have I lost you if I have a chair that say that's all I have but if I have the word I can produce everything I can produce this chair I can produce this guitar and I don't have to carry [Applause] them have I lost somebody have I lost somebody have I lost somebody now I have a question if you traveling by foot like Israel do you want to carry your provision or you can carry the word word if you carry the word and you need something is that a problem no now you start getting to the materiales now we get into the material now this is my subject my subject this morning is teach us to pray Our Daily Bread what divine hunger let me start it again teachers to pray we are capping the state of roof amen amen teachers to pray Our Daily Bread a nation that love God is a nation that seek God how daily amen our daily bread but the Divine hunger what is going on brother stepen this is where we stop and this is where we are in the Lord's Prayer according to Matthew Matthew say give us this day our what daily bread and according to Luke Luke say give us day by day our what daily bread when we started here from that statement we drew responsibility you remember that amen we drew Assurance or a guarantee you remember that we drew dependency amen and we saw that God was a provider amen we clear and also we spoke about uh the secret of what of asking amen so what's going on again with this prayer this one statement is pulling all these things together amen one statement give us this day our daily bread it's pulling sermon after sermon so the Lord was not just speaking about repeating something God had more than that amen so how does this is connected to Divine hunger we clear can we clam can we clam according to Matthew chapter 6 Matthew say give us we clear give us what it's right there give us this day give us this day can I raise this you already understand that right can I raise it thank you give us this day what our daily bread give us this day our and what daily bread daily bread daily bread and according to Luke what did Luke say my friend give us day by day let's go give as what day by day day by day what our daily bread our what daily bread daily bread amen when we look at this statement we understand that givers is speaking about a request we clear givers is a request somebody is asking amen and somebody's demanding something amen it's a request a men but the Bible says give us this day it is not just any day are we together it is a specific day we clear it is a specific day and it's a day that the one who asking is living [Applause] in come on come on help me move faster I'm in 25 M an hour if you don't say Amen I'll go 15 mil an hour because I want to make sure somebody's getting it are we together so it is not just give us a day but give us this day in other word this person who's asking is living in that day are we together and he's not just leaving it's a limited day it's a specific day it is Sunday today you are telling somebody give me this day in other word give me today give me today amen it is specific to a day or it is limited to a certain day that that individual is living we clear together and then he says give me this day what hour means possession amen are we okay when we say our it means that you own [Music] [Applause] it we are climbing into a different layer my friend when we mean ours means that it is your belonging it is something that already belonged to you and you are just claiming it because you should have said give me this day a bread then we know it's not your bread but when you come back you say give me this day my car so that car was originally mine amen hallelujah everybody okay amen it looks like the one requesting is only asking something that already belong to [Music] him are we together it looks like this day is the day is the due day or the due date everybody okay that this individual is supposed to take something out of somebody are we together amen are we together amen give us this day our our what Daily Bread so this bread is given not every day it is the bread of the day it is a portion specific for that day are you following me are you following me have I lost somebody it is the bread of one day Have I Lost somebody give us somebody's asking somebody's requesting somebody's demanding give us which day tomorrow not this day limited I mean that day it's in the present amen give me this day today give me this day this day what hour something that already belonged to me amen and give me this day our what Daily Bread so this bread comes usually automatic per day are we together are we together now when you go back to M uh to Luke Luke say also give and we know give us it means somebody's requesting we know ours means that it's ownership we know daily means that it's one day but we see look here interpret it a little bit different Luke says not give us this day amen amen because Matthew deal with the present time only are you following me but Luke is saying give me day by day in other word look is not limited to the present time are we together Luke give you the hope that whatever happened today will also happen tomorrow amen are we together are we together are we together so look because yesterday was a day that's right amen yesterday was a day today is a day tomorrow is a day so when Luke say give me day by day Luke is covering the Past come on yeah come on come on come on come on L is covering the past and the what present and the what future because Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and [Applause] forever are we together are we together so L it's talking about a full Providence for the past for the present and for the future which is I mean in what compatible with Hebrew 1338 in other word Luke is saying whatever happened yesterday it's guaranteed for today amen and it's also guaranteed for tomorrow but usually yesterday is a history yesterday don't scare you anymore because whatever happened yesterday is sealed what concern you it is what what is happening today and what's going to happen where tomorrow but look now since the p is a history amen look now take care of our future are we together that this bread is not just a bread of a day it is a bread that will also happen tomorrow everybody okay and it's a bread that is daily amen listen a little bit to this in the Book of Matthew chapter 6 verse 34 Jesus say take no thought for what tomorrow not the past remember the past is history whatever happened yesterday is gone whatever happened on the day of Thanksgiving we can only see that on the picture we are no more anxious about Thanksgiving is coming Thanksgiving is no no no Thanksgiving is going gone and it's gone with its pressure but the pressure is tomorrow I have to go to work that's what is building your tension that is what is building your anxiety now when Luke say give us day by day Luke is taking care of the past of the present and he's releasing us from the anxiety of tomorrow are we together Jesus say take therefore no thought for what tomorrow in other words do not worry about tomorrow because every day day by day there is something that is provided amen are we together he says do not worry take no thought about tomorrow for what tomorrow shall not shall take thought for the things of his in other word tomorrow will take care of itself in other words this benefits here are daily benefit right what happened
