[23:14] people give their tithes and offering
[23:15] Lord may you just bless it as well we
[23:17] pray in Jesus name
[23:19] so I just quick testimonial it happened
[23:23] a week or two ago but my me and my wife
[23:27] were driving down the road and we were
[23:28] going speed limit it was like 50 I think
[23:30] this turbulence 15 when we're going 50
[23:32] and a deer jumped right out in front of
[23:35] us and I hit my brakes but I mean if it
[23:38] was if it was a foot closer we would
[23:40] have destroyed our car and it passed by
[23:43] and then right after the single deer
[23:45] passed by a deer followed it in the car
[23:47] coming the opposite way hit that deer
[23:49] and totaled their front end of their car
[23:51] and the deer flew up it's went off their
[23:54] windshield and flew up right over top of
[23:56] me and Destiny's vehicle so the first
[23:58] one got right in front of us and the
[24:00] second one went right over top of us and
[24:01] I knew that was just the Angels just
[24:03] pushing the deer away so I just wanted
[24:05] to praise the Lord for that thank you
[24:07] for that I want to take just a minute as
[24:18] well prior to the Cova thing causing us
[24:23] to be separated it was on my heart then
[24:32] that because we have a candidate for
[24:38] pastor that we should take a vote on him
[24:40] if we don't want him in then we can
[24:45] bring others in okay as opposed to a
[24:48] competition or whatever you want to call
[24:51] it but because you know we've been
[24:55] separated it just hasn't been an
[24:58] opportunity to bring this up and it's
[25:02] just really it's been an extreme burden
[25:05] on my heart for about two months that
[25:10] you know brother Brennan said a pastor
[25:13] needs to be a solid teacher and we have
[25:17] teachers we have solid teachers and we
[25:21] have a candidate and regardless of you
[25:26] know who else might be qualified or we
[25:29] we have to look at the one that we have
[25:30] and not delay
[25:32] we're someone seven months into this is
[25:34] this group and I just sang about having
[25:42] a voice in heaven let me lift my voice
[25:45] that's what I'm doing and the other song
[25:49] I would not be denied I don't want my
[25:51] voice denied I don't want anybody else
[25:52] who feels the same way about having a
[25:54] vote to have their voice tonight I'm
[25:57] saying it is I'm asking if we cannot
[26:01] have a meeting after service next week
[26:04] here to arrange to extend like we have
[26:08] in the past and hold a vote on the
[26:13] candidate that we have not a paper vote
[26:17] we can't have an online vote so we need
[26:20] the people that are streaming that would
[26:21] be willing to come in and vote to do so
[26:27] in person that's the only way that it
[26:28] can be done to be scriptural and it's
[26:32] long it's been long enough if you know
[26:36] if we don't want our candidate as a
[26:40] pastor make your voice heard lift your
[26:43] voice and vote no but if you do then we
[26:47] need to go ahead we can't have trustees
[26:49] we can't have deacons I'm a fill in
[26:52] because a song leader is a pastor
[26:54] appointed position the pastor's
[26:58] ultimately responsible for the service
[27:01] and the worship I'm just filling in
[27:05] brother Abel would fill in as well so we
[27:08] need to get back to the work we need to
[27:11] get especially within the limits of the
[27:14] message and write and do it soon so we
[27:19] can establish ourselves as a proper
[27:22] Church so I hope I'm not by myself
[27:28] standing here voicing this okay and we
[27:32] need to go ahead while we're here and
[27:35] talk to the people about getting the
[27:37] room for next week for at least two
[27:41] hours
[27:42] this is a pastoral issue it will only be
[27:45] about electing a pastor not money not
[27:51] anything else it's just just has to be
[27:56] done that's you know
[27:58] so let's stand I don't want to kill a
[28:01] spirit I didn't want to come across
[28:03] wrong and it jeopardize any any kind of
[28:06] a spirit or place a bad one here in the
[28:09] service so we're gonna sing because he
[28:12] lives it's our old from the goal isn't
[28:15] it to live like he lives and then we'll
[28:20] invite brother Micah Holloway to come as
[28:23] we as we sing this because he
[28:31] I can face tomorrow because sound like
[29:28] it's working amen amen
[29:31] praise the Lord Amen it's certainly good
[29:34] to be back and see your faces amen and I
[29:38] know it's a little while and my wife
[29:41] were just talking with the good in the
[29:42] love the Lord and for dimmed out of the
[29:44] called according to his purpose and
[29:46] brother Graham says in many places
[29:48] there's nothing out of catered never he
[29:51] said I as it may look that way he said
[29:54] but God always has it under control so I
[29:57] just want to thank God for that
[30:01] appreciate the the burden brother John
[30:05] has in his heart that he shared this
[30:08] morning for for the pastoral office cuz
[30:10] we do that is something that we need to
[30:13] address soon and but I will say that we
[30:19] do have a small body to the problem you
[30:22] see the for moment we do have a
[30:25] committee and that committee has been
[30:30] discussing these matters and and so uh
[30:34] so it is something under advisement and
[30:37] as soon as the committee is ready to
[30:39] move forward with this local assembly
[30:42] then they'll present what those options
[30:44] are
[30:45] but uh but I do assure you where the
[30:47] Shango was definitely uh Canada on the
[30:49] table and and we believe he's uh I
[30:53] should say gifted minister would be an
[30:55] understatement
[30:56] man it's definitely got a gift it's uh
[30:58] outstanding when it comes to teaching
[31:00] ministry don't don't know a lot of
[31:02] brothers like it I say that sincerely
[31:03] and and I know he's a man has got a call
[31:06] in and his desire to be a pastor and so
[31:09] we respect that too but but as far as
[31:11] how we proceed it may be next weekend I
[31:14] make service it may not be but but we
[31:17] definitely want to make sure that when
[31:18] we move forward we do it in the right
[31:21] way and the confidence when this
[31:24] assembly is been put into the hands of
[31:26] the committee and the committee is going
[31:28] to move forward according to how they
[31:30] feel late as a committee so I just want
[31:32] to say acknowledges comments but let's
[31:35] just be aware that there is a proper way
[31:37] to move forward and so we want to we
[31:39] want to definitely respect that but but
[31:43] I do believe that they'll probably be a
[31:45] vote soon and and like I said under
[31:49] brother Stephens expressed his interest
[31:50] and far as I know he's the only brother
[31:52] and I missed a sexy expressed a desire
[31:55] so uh so I do believe he will be a
[31:58] consideration when that vote is cast but
[32:01] I don't know if it'll be in a week or
[32:03] two weeks we were not prepared to say
[32:05] that just yet but one thing we do want
[32:07] to do is wait if there's enough people
[32:08] present so when the vote does go forward
[32:11] that the body as a whole has the best
[32:14] opportunity to vote on it
[32:15] amen amen thank man if you have your
[32:20] Bibles and invite you to turn me the
[32:21] book of the book of Genesis the book of
[32:26] Genesis and we've got a pretty simple
[32:36] thought in our heart as always I did
[32:39] want to say this that you know I haven't
[32:42] had a chance or I haven't I should say
[32:44] stream the service probably in five
[32:47] weeks maybe six I know when we first
[32:51] started streaming i I caught the first
[32:53] service brother Stephen did I think I
[32:56] caught half of the second service
[32:57] brother Stephen did because
[32:59] we had the minister that evening so we
[33:01] didn't have a chance to finish out the
[33:02] service but but I really we don't have
[33:05] much of a clue of what he's preached on
[33:06] the past five or six weeks because we
[33:08] hadn't screamed in their services so I'm
[33:10] just kind of craft without what we have
[33:12] this morning will fit in the continuity
[33:14] whatever the Holy Spirit's already been
[33:16] doing and just be a thought that'll add
[33:18] to what God's already been doing to help
[33:20] take this local symbol a bit further
[33:24] look in Genesis chapter 3 in Genesis
[33:28] chapter 3 and before we read let's just
[33:41] bow as for a word of Prayer dear
[33:46] Heavenly Father Lord we just want to
[33:50] give you thanks thank you for your grace
[33:55] for your fellowship thank you Lord for
[34:00] allowing us to come together as a local
[34:02] assembly again Lord you know all the
[34:06] needs that are present in order desires
[34:09] upon our hearts each one of us even as a
[34:12] brother John just expressed that great
[34:15] burden for a headship and Lord that's
[34:19] what we want to talk about this morning
[34:20] his headship Lord just assembly needs
[34:25] the headship it needs a man is called a
[34:28] God gifted of God anointed by God for a
[34:31] purpose for this assembly cannot be all
[34:36] that you or data to be without such a
[34:39] man in position
[34:41] Lord official desire to be brother
[34:43] Stephen Lord may you bless him and your
[34:46] hand Grace place him there and God may
[34:49] he be a light in this area to this
[34:51] assembly as a leader ordained by you for
[34:56] the purpose of taking your bride forward

[37:32] and between thy seed and her seed and it
[37:36] shall bruise thy head and thou shalt
[37:38] bruise his heel until the woman he said
[37:41] I will greatly multiply thy sorrow and
[37:43] thy conception and sorrow thou shalt

[38:18] words Almighty God and Lord I know
[38:21] you're worried whenever he goes forth it
[38:22] will always accomplish that which was
[38:24] sent to do that's our confidence we
[38:27] accident Jesus Christ name Amen
[38:30] amen the title of my message today is
[38:39] the hour of restoration the our
[38:43] restoration you see it a lot of times in
[38:46] the Bible the reference to our and
[38:51] identifying a particular event in my
[38:55] searching scriptures and I could be
[38:57] wrong but I did a little searching I
[38:59] didn't see it I never saw anything about
[39:01] any increments smaller than an hour this
[39:04] meant as this this hour and then in
[39:07] revelations chapter 8 it talks about the
[39:10] half hour which is still predicated upon
[39:13] the hour but you don't see minutes and
[39:16] hours use usually to identify a specific
[39:19] point in time when they said our of is
[39:22] coming you followed me and no man should
[39:26] know the day or the hour they use our to
[39:28] specify a particular time and usually
[39:31] because they want identify something
[39:33] that's going to happen
[39:34] at that particular time so my time is
[39:36] the hour of restoration I want to talk
[39:37] about restoration and we find in the
[39:40] scripture God and type was visiting his
[39:43] first church the Garden of Eden that was
[39:45] Adam and Eve and this visitation was
[39:47] taking place after the fall
[39:49] Adam had sinned Evette sinned and Adam
[39:52] has sinned by listening to the wisdom of
[39:57] his wife and Eve had sinned by listening
[39:59] to the reason of Satan and a form of the
[40:01] Serpent and and she was deceived because
[40:06] brother Branham says she had received a
[40:08] wrong interpretation of the word God had
[40:11] given her to word and she had the
[40:14] knowledge or another interpretation
[40:17] she said Satan was right there ready to
[40:19] give her another interpretation and the
[40:22] interpretation was so close that even
[40:25] ever recognized that the word had
[40:26] actually changed and what was being
[40:29] preached to her was not the original
[40:30] revelation are you follow me I want you
[40:33] to watch this so evil deceived by
[40:36] reasoning because when her reason is she
[40:37] received another interpretation and Eve
[40:40] brother Branham said was a perfect type
[40:42] of this New Testament church the age the
[40:45] time that you and I live in we are the
[40:47] New Testament church we're not of the
[40:49] old and this is a perfect type of what
[40:51] happened in the time in the garden with
[40:53] Adam and Eve in that hours something
[40:54] took place and brother Bama said he
[40:56] could see the same thing only repeating
[40:58] itself again are you following me and so
[41:00] evil is a type of the New Testament
[41:02] church and as a type of that church he
[41:04] being free could type she was actually
[41:06] taken from Adam who was her husband are
[41:09] you following me the one who she was
[41:10] created or taken from to be a help me to
[41:13] she was literally a part of Adam she was
[41:15] born of his bones she was flesh of his
[41:17] flesh she was literally spirit of his
[41:19] spirit he was nothing less than Adam are
[41:22] you following me reincarnated in another
[41:24] form but the men who send the message
[41:26] oneness she said she and animal 1
[41:29] because her spirit her life even came
[41:31] from Adam Adam God didn't put another
[41:33] life in the eve she took Adams life and
[41:36] a part of Adam's life in the feminist
[41:38] form and that's what he may be from a
[41:40] perfect type of the church really
[41:42] literally bone of his bone we're flesh
[41:44] of his flesh
[41:45] what was his flesh as flesh was the word
[41:46] and the same spirit
[41:48] I was in Christ God literally taste that
[41:50] same spirit and he puts it into the New
[41:52] Testament church are you follow me son I
[41:55] want you to watch this he was so much
[41:58] like Adam that before the fall she even
[42:02] bought his name
[42:03] God did not see a difference come down
[42:06] to say Adam where is Eve when God came
[42:08] out I said Adam Adam where art thou he
[42:10] was actually calling the same person
[42:13] Genesis 1 Genesis 5:1 says and this is
[42:17] the book of generations of Adam listen
[42:19] Adam and the day God created man and his
[42:22] lightness God created he him male and
[42:24] female created he them now remember he's
[42:26] talking about one person Adam and
[42:28] blessed him and call their name their
[42:32] name Adam God did not place any
[42:36] separation between the two I want you to
[42:40] watch this so even from Adam she was
[42:44] literally a part of Adam they were one
[42:46] in heart they were one in spirit but
[42:48] then came to fall now why is Genesis 3
[42:51] Genesis 3:16 until the woman he said I
[42:56] would greatly multiply thy sorrow and
[42:58] thy conception and sorrow thou shalt
[43:01] bring forth children why was her person
[43:04] killed why was her punishment in
[43:05] childbearing because she was given to
[43:07] Adam has to help me and that's what Adam
[43:09] needed was Animas commission to bring
[43:12] forth sons of God and he needed to help
[43:14] me somebody to have her in a job so God
[43:17] gave Eve to Adam at the time she was
[43:19] Adam he gave Adam - Adam for the purpose
[43:22] of Adam fulfilling his word his desire
[43:25] to bring forth sons of God
[43:29] so her fall was in the childbearing her
[43:32] suffer came to childbearing because she
[43:34] was created as a vessel for childbearing
[43:36] I want you to watch this and that desire
[43:39] speaking to Eve and that desire shall be
[43:42] to thy husband and he shall rule over
[43:45] thee here in Genesis 3:16 God had to
[43:48] come now in a certain hour and he had to
[43:50] restore her heart why because the
[43:53] serpent beguiled her by lust and
[43:55] perversion and turned her heart from
[43:57] Adam to serpent but God had to restore
[43:59] that woman's heart
[44:00] to the rightful man she couldn't do it
[44:03] Adam couldn't do it but God literally
[44:05] turned her heart back to her rightful
[44:08] husband this happened an hour of
[44:12] restoration Eve was found in the
[44:15] condition when she needed restoration
[44:16] and Adam couldn't do it she couldn't do
[44:19] it but God could and he did and that
[44:24] restoration was to turn our heart back
[44:26] because when she left God when she left
[44:28] the word when she left her husband she
[44:31] live all the same because listen she was
[44:33] created by God and given a word for the
[44:36] purpose of helping her husband to
[44:37] breathe for sons of God I want you to
[44:42] watch this so Eve was made and help me
[44:46] and same took advances opportunity
[44:50] because she was a free moral agent just
[44:52] like Adam was and Satan made her a
[44:55] proposition he gave her an opportunity
[44:57] and she turned her desire from her
[45:00] husband Adam to act on his proposition
[45:03] never recognize that she was leaving the
[45:06] word and God now I want you to kiss that
[45:09] cuz it's gonna be thought of my message
[45:11] she moved from her husband for which she
[45:17] was created for and she never recognized
[45:20] in her move she was leaving her husband
[45:23] and she was leaving the word as she was
[45:26] leaving God all in one act as she was so
[45:30] convinced she was feeling the will of
[45:31] God that she came back to Adam said
[45:33] honey let me show you what I've learned
[45:35] and she gave him of the tree that she
[45:37] had he know and Adam knew that she was
[45:39] wrong the program said but because of
[45:41] love his woman he took of it anyway but
[45:43] she came thinking she was doing the
[45:45] right thing are you with me and so she
[45:52] was given Adam for help me and Adam was
[45:56] too brief for all the sons in God and so
[45:57] he needed someone to have him in that
[45:59] position and God gave him an acceptable
[46:03] person to do that and that person was
[46:04] called Adam which he now called Eve but
[46:08] was saying over the proposition because
[46:10] she couldn't discern the word she
[46:12] accepted aloud
[46:13] but the truth now once you get this
[46:16] brother branham said that same told her
[46:18] that you'd be like gods he said and he
[46:20] wasn't lying to no good and evil he said
[46:24] well because Eve never knew both sides
[46:26] she only knew the good she never knew
[46:29] evil her brother Bama said but she never
[46:32] received that full promise why he said
[46:34] because she was deceived she never
[46:36] understood her wrong so she could never
[46:38] see her evil she could never see her
[46:42] evil that's why she took it to Adam she
[46:45] couldn't see where it was wrong
[46:47] remember this is a type of the New
[46:49] Testament church you can leave God you
[46:51] can leave your headship you can leave
[46:52] the word and never recognize you're
[46:54] wrong and then brag about it look what
[47:02] I've done
[47:05] are you follow me now I want you to
[47:10] watch this
[47:12] she was so deceived but the banner said
[47:15] when she was leaving the garden she was
[47:17] crying action Adam what's wrong what's
[47:21] wrong what's wrong he had knowledge of
[47:26] good and evil she never caught it and
[47:31] even after the fall outside of the
[47:35] garden look at Genesis 4:1 she never
[47:38] caught it Genesis 4:1 and Adam knew his
[47:43] wife and she conceived and bore Cain
[47:46] listen aim and when she for Cain she
[47:50] said and I have gotten a man from the
[47:53] Lord brother Branham said she wasn't
[47:56] wrong cuz any life that comes forth
[47:59] comes from God but he didn't recognize
[48:01] the perversion she had given birth to
[48:06] are you following me and she again bare
[48:11] his brother Abel and Abel was a keeper
[48:13] of the sheep but Cain was a tiller of
[48:16] the ground even though she got results
[48:20] from her actions her results were
[48:24] outside of the will of God
[48:26] and they were out sounded word god this
[48:29] is a perfect type listen Oh Matthew
[48:31] seven I want you to turn if you have
[48:33] your Bibles open Matthew seven Matthew
[48:35] 7:21 and I want to tell you how this
[48:38] typed the New Testament church people
[48:41] that can walk with God or people that
[48:43] can fellowship with God or people that
[48:45] can actually have gifts and people have
[48:46] great anointing and people could even do
[48:48] works and get results and you're not
[48:50] recognized they're completely out of the
[48:53] word will of God Matthew 7:21 not
[48:59] everyone that saith unto me Lord Lord
[49:01] shall enter into the kingdom of heaven
[49:03] but he that doeth the will of my father
[49:06] which is in heaven
[49:07] many just said unto me in that day Lord
[49:09] Lord have we not prophesied in thy name
[49:11] and thy name cast out devils and in thy
[49:15] name done many wonderful works then
[49:18] listen and then will I profess unto them
[49:20] I never knew you depart from me ye that
[49:22] work of iniquity just as Cain was
[49:25] rejected and his works were rejected
[49:27] because he was actually a perversion of
[49:29] the will of God so will it be at the
[49:31] white throne judgment when there'll be
[49:32] many come up in his name and say I've
[49:34] done works in my name and they'll be
[49:36] rejected just like Cain why they did the
[49:38] work but their works were not accepted I
[49:42] don't just want to do works I really
[49:44] pray God have grace our brother Michael
[49:46] Holloway let my words be pleased in that
[49:48] site and in that great day let them be
[49:50] accepted
[49:54] now listen this group of Matthew seven
[49:57] they're like Balaam he was a man called
[50:02] he was a man gifted he was a man
[50:05] anointed he was a man of reputation and
[50:08] brother Branham said and he was a
[50:10] prophet he said some say Balaam was a
[50:13] soothsayer brother BAM said I deny that
[50:15] claim he said Balaam was a genuine
[50:18] prophet of the Lord he said as a matter
[50:20] of fact he still has prophesies this day
[50:22] that'll come in the past he said he was
[50:24] not a soothsayer he was a man that had
[50:26] given himself the false teaching but the
[50:28] gift was genuine
[50:30] the man was false but the gift was
[50:34] genuine
[50:37] now listen listen his gift was so
[50:42] vindicated that it was even known up
[50:45] unto the King's chambers when Israel's
[50:48] coming out of Egypt and they lack had
[50:50] heard he said this is the nation
[50:53] anointed by their God now he didn't
[50:56] realize that the God that they were
[50:57] anointed by was the same God that balaam
[50:59] talked to because they believe they
[51:00] believe I'm not believing me but what he
[51:02] calls multiple gods when you polytheism
[51:05] thank you brother
[51:06] they believe in polytheism you can have
[51:08] as many guys you can afford to pay tax
[51:10] to are you follow me but this man right
[51:14] here
[51:14] his reputation was so great that when
[51:16] the king heard about this nation of
[51:18] Israel coming up out of Egypt and Heidi
[51:20] described Freud ai and how dare destroy
[51:23] our Pharaoh and he would come this way
[51:25] bill I said my army is there no defense
[51:27] against his people because I heard that
[51:29] God fight for them so the only way to
[51:31] fight God is you got to get another God
[51:33] because flesh and blood cannot fight God
[51:35] they like knew this and when he wanted
[51:38] to get a man he said find me a man not
[51:40] be false people in my cab I know these
[51:42] are false preachers find me a real man
[51:44] like I get a hold of God they said sure
[51:46] we know one his name is Bill X that's
[51:49] the kind of man bill that was he was a
[51:53] man and knew God and he talked to God
[51:58] lip dear he would go into prayer and
[52:02] pray through is such an anointing that
[52:05] God will come down and save a leg what
[52:07] is it finish it with a thought I got
[52:09] something my heart Lord pull up a chair
[52:11] sit talk to me Bailey
[52:12] he said well I got some me and visit
[52:14] with you another country and they want
[52:16] me to come preach a sermon for free
[52:17] cities for him he loves me I know these
[52:19] people be like don't go with him they
[52:21] want trouble be like I got you here my
[52:23] servant you don't you're excused in this
[52:25] meeting you ain't got to appreciate some
[52:26] vision but I want to notice something
[52:29] the way Satan was able to get Eve off of
[52:33] the original Word of God was the same
[52:35] way he got bail on even though Baylor
[52:39] was a gifted man Benton was a northern
[52:41] man Balaam had been in God's presence on
[52:43] numerous occasions yet there was
[52:45] something way down
[52:47] impart that nobody else knew Bob a lo
[52:49] and God and Satan Satan has studied him
[52:56] he knew a bale of light he knew a Balaam
[53:00] didn't like Balaam didn't have to talk a
[53:02] whole lot he can read his action to say
[53:04] this man likes popularity or you follow
[53:06] me
[53:07] he likes the chief seats he likes going
[53:10] to the biggest meetings he can see what
[53:12] was in Valens heart not because he had a
[53:14] deserving gift but he can look at
[53:15] baylin's life and actions I see
[53:18] something in his man and so when the
[53:21] opportunity came he approached Baylor
[53:24] he was looking for something to get
[53:27] Balaam off of the word just like he was
[53:30] looking for something to get Eve off of
[53:32] the word just like he's looking at every
[53:34] one of us here a day to give you
[53:36] something to get you off of the word but
[53:42] it takes a real humble heart before the
[53:45] hand of Almighty God they said God I
[53:47] will not move unless you tell me thus
[53:49] said the Lord that's a rare person it's
[53:57] not that ratified people that had the
[53:59] knowledge of God it's not their fare to
[54:01] ride people that would even talk in his
[54:03] name but one that would humble
[54:06] themselves under the mighty hand of God
[54:08] that's a man God says the Pearl in my
[54:12] sight he's a man of great Christ why cuz
[54:14] pearls are rare me like that are rare
[54:20] sisters like that are rare but by God's
[54:24] grace and election he's predestinated
[54:27] son
[54:30] and he's so confident that predestiny to
[54:33] see Satan comes a guy and he'll say have
[54:36] you tried brother Robert are you
[54:39] following me
[54:40] have you tried my servants Wow because
[54:44] not because the flesh is so great but he
[54:46] knows my predestination what he's placed
[54:49] in that flesh now say T studies a man
[54:56] speaking propositional and that desired
[54:59] have thought that hunger for certain
[55:02] things is it every man this thing's that
[55:04] this little I like for the mic that's
[55:07] the wrong thing for preachers say but
[55:09] I'm being honest I like nice cars I
[55:12] don't plan to drive that in heaven my
[55:17] wife likes a nice houses I might not
[55:19] abort on one yet but she likes him it's
[55:23] not being wrong as I brother to say it
[55:26] we're liking certain things but we're
[55:29] never to let any of those things come
[55:31] between you and the will and programs of
[55:34] Almighty God even John wrote in his book
[55:40] I wouldn t prosper and be in health even
[55:43] as that soul prospers as long as you
[55:45] love God more then let the natural pace
[55:47] slow but if you don't know God's you
[55:49] might not need them cuz you won't be
[55:52] able to handle them Oh Stevie love God
[55:58] you got a big house man maybe that's my
[56:03] problem I need to love to some more
[56:06] maybe I might get me a bigger house that
[56:07] I can give it a high shear off if matter
[56:11] of fate you got a big house because but
[56:13] but every man has that natural thing you
[56:18] wrestle with and a lot of times we won't
[56:21] tell nobody about it but is there or you
[56:25] follow me now I want you to watch this
[56:28] we all have that little something inside
[56:31] but as Christians we testify about a
[56:34] love for the Lord
[56:35] and I'm not saying hypocrites I'm to my
[56:36] real Christians people see that I see
[56:40] the life of the people that I'm looking
[56:41] at in front of me I'll say
[56:42] your testimony's how you going through
[56:44] good times bad times and how you still
[56:46] hold strong to your testimony why
[56:47] because you love the Lord what you see
[56:50] that is manifested and we talk about his
[56:52] birth we see that we manifest it and we
[56:54] pray and we desire briolette spiritual
[56:56] blessings why because that's what a
[56:57] Christian should do but beyond that
[57:00] there's something on the inside of all
[57:02] of us that Sam is looking at and he's
[57:06] making notes
[57:07] and he plans to use those notes or you
[57:10] follow me
[57:11] he studied Balaam he saw baylin's love
[57:14] for popularity he studied Sampson he saw
[57:20] SAMHSA's love for a woman Sampson I want
[57:24] you to catch this was raised for purpose
[57:27] his commission his purpose was to
[57:31] destroy the Philistines because God said
[57:33] they're my enemies because they're the
[57:35] enemy of my children I mention Israel
[57:37] and I want to now raise up a man that
[57:39] can destroy my enemies and my true sin
[57:41] me that Samson Dowler that man and you
[57:44] know SAMHSA's biggest stumbling block
[57:46] was the thing he was raised at the
[57:48] destroyed not just a woman a Philistine
[57:52] woman say no if I could get close as
[57:57] hard he'll not wait on my wife because
[57:59] he's in love with the thing he was
[58:01] raised in the destroy and this last day
[58:04] Pentecostal church was raised up as a
[58:06] lay-oh
[58:07] that she had Church the Pentecostal age
[58:09] and God raised him up to smash to
[58:11] nomination to the ground and what did
[58:13] they do
[58:14] they became a denomination they failed
[58:18] to the very thing they were raised up to
[58:21] destroy I want you to watch this then
[58:27] you got Judas
[58:28] Satan wise Judas he saw in Judas when he
[58:32] would take up the offerings he put some
[58:34] of the money back he put some of his bag
[58:36] he put some of the money back he was
[58:39] humming his bad sayings that know how to
[58:41] work on this one he likes money so when
[58:45] it came time to use him he knew how to
[58:47] approach him he said Gollum any
[58:50] and you are from 24 30 pieces of silver
[58:52] and he'll be glad to take your
[58:54] proposition he knew the man Satan knows
[59:01] us better than perhaps we think but I
[59:04] want you to watch this but these men had
[59:08] a purpose and you and I were created for
[59:13] purpose but we should never let I desire
[59:16] come between us and that perfect brother
[59:19] branham talked about
[59:22] I raised up for a purpose his purpose
[59:26] was to be a delivery and then at a time
[59:29] of his ministry Moses went about it the
[59:32] wrong way it wasn't that he
[59:34] misunderstood his purpose he wouldn't
[59:36] about it wrong brother BAM said the
[59:39] mistake he had was not that it wasn't
[59:40] the time not that he wasn't the man he
[59:44] said but he left God out of it Moses
[59:48] went to deliver his people by education
[59:50] and not by revelation and not by the
[59:54] anointing of the Holy Ghost he thought
[59:56] what he had learned in Egypt was
[59:58] sufficient to bring me out what he
[59:59] thought he wanted to do which the bring
[1:00:01] his people out and so he tried to take
[1:00:02] that military knowledge and demonstrate
[1:00:04] it and it didn't persuade the people and
[1:00:06] leave it affect these Egypt one big Wow
[1:00:08] because God never intended for Moses to
[1:00:10] be glorified God said Moses I want to be
[1:00:13] glorified I said I will bring them out
[1:00:16] with a might have him not to Moses now
[1:00:23] say temptation you and I on it's our is
[1:00:25] he wants you and out of faith somehow
[1:00:26] letter you got a part in it something
[1:00:28] you can do the hedge or something God
[1:00:30] means from you and our debris is where
[1:00:32] the pass but what God needs is a
[1:00:33] surrender heart hum of his hand and said
[1:00:36] God you promised it and I rest 100% on
[1:00:38] what you promised why did God wait 25
[1:00:44] years to Abraham he didn't have to wait
[1:00:45] a day why 25 years sort of Abraham can
[1:00:48] learn and be a testimony it's not by you
[1:00:51] Abraham but I made the promise and throw
[1:00:54] your body be dance until your white baby
[1:00:56] dance that doesn't stop my promise one
[1:00:58] bit nothing sonicator so our confidence
[1:01:06] this message came to give you in that
[1:01:08] confidence who is the mighty one who is
[1:01:11] the mighty one and where is he
[1:01:15] according to my Bible it said he's my
[1:01:18] friend the Almighty God is my friend and
[1:01:24] what I need to talk to him these
[1:01:26] that's ready to hear and you know what
[1:01:32] he likes to talk about his promises Lord
[1:01:37] our reading of the day where you say I
[1:01:39] was losing my babbling you say I would
[1:01:42] listen to a tape and I heard you speak
[1:01:44] to that prophet and you say will you go
[1:01:48] back to him he likes that science has
[1:01:51] proven that there was a study done
[1:01:56] several years back it was on the cover
[1:01:59] of a magazine
[1:02:00] now remember because that's when I God
[1:02:03] healed my back and they would talk about
[1:02:05] having surgery on my spine and God hit
[1:02:07] my back I never had that pain again I
[1:02:09] never had that surgery and I couldn't
[1:02:10] even walk at the time I was so bad I had
[1:02:12] almost crawled about his office but I
[1:02:14] can run I could jump I would jump on a
[1:02:16] chair play crazy I could jump now why he
[1:02:20] touched me but listen the same weekend I
[1:02:24] was my follow-up visit the scheduled
[1:02:26] surgery the suddenly before there was a
[1:02:29] cover for a magazine that said the power
[1:02:32] prayer science had discovered the power
[1:02:35] of prayer science now not theologians
[1:02:38] and they did a study and they found out
[1:02:41] that when people came into the hospital
[1:02:43] of pray there was literally a light that
[1:02:46] could be seen through necks ray on the
[1:02:48] heads they laid hands upon the sick but
[1:02:52] they noticed this big difference in
[1:02:54] their study the Christians that sippar
[1:02:57] came in and offer prayer had very low
[1:03:01] margins of success but the Christians
[1:03:05] that came in off a prayer but quoted a
[1:03:09] promise with their prayer had much
[1:03:12] higher success rates why they weren't
[1:03:15] going and hoping when I heard Gaza Hill
[1:03:17] little hill this man but think Oh God
[1:03:19] said God you said I shall lay hands upon
[1:03:22] the sick and they shall recover God I'm
[1:03:24] doing this accordance of that word
[1:03:27] greater margin of success so are you
[1:03:34] pray know who you pray to and know what
[1:03:37] he likes to hear I want you to watch
[1:03:42] what you watch this Moses was a man is
[1:03:46] satan couldn't pay off because he knew
[1:03:48] his commission and his purpose Elijah
[1:03:51] was a man didn't pay off he knew his
[1:03:55] commission and his purpose I want you to
[1:03:57] watch this and then we find Jesus Christ
[1:04:00] he was a perfect man he was the man
[1:04:03] Satan could not pay off no matter what
[1:04:06] he offered him because Jesus Christ knew
[1:04:08] his commission and his purpose turn me
[1:04:11] to Hebrews chapter 10 I'm laying the
[1:04:12] foundation I'm gonna be long in my top
[1:04:14] right get to the price right it won't be
[1:04:15] long under the laying a foundation
[1:04:16] because I want to see some church do you
[1:04:18] already procured your people and when I
[1:04:22] finish I want to know one thing you are
[1:04:24] placed here for a purpose
[1:04:27] he was there for a purpose
[1:04:29] Moses was there for a purpose price is
[1:04:31] there for a purpose you're in here
[1:04:32] neighborly Abel you're here for a
[1:04:34] purpose
[1:04:38] Hebrews 10 one for the law having a
[1:04:42] shadow of good things to come and not
[1:04:43] the very image of those things can never
[1:04:46] know sacrifices which they offer here by
[1:04:48] year continually make the comers
[1:04:49] thereunto perfect for then they would
[1:04:52] not have ceased to be offered because
[1:04:54] that the ones of worse were once purged
[1:04:56] should have no more conscious of other
[1:04:58] Brown said desire of sins but in those
[1:05:00] sacrifices there is a remembrance again
[1:05:02] made of sins every year for it is not
[1:05:04] possible that the blood of goats and of
[1:05:06] bulls and of goats should take away sins
[1:05:08] wherefore when he cometh into the world
[1:05:10] he saith listen listen this now this is
[1:05:14] Christ speaking now when he comes into
[1:05:16] world sacrifice and offerings that would
[1:05:19] have not I want to bring us a new today
[1:05:26] the nominations ideas a man theological
[1:05:32] seminaries that would not God I'm not
[1:05:37] you not even looking for that your eyes
[1:05:40] don't even turn
[1:05:41] that direction listen listen but a body
[1:05:48] has now prepared me Christ understood
[1:05:52] God was looking for my body and he
[1:05:56] understood he was the body God had been
[1:05:59] looking for do you realize this morning
[1:06:04] you are a part of a body brother than I
[1:06:06] and that body is the body for 2,000
[1:06:09] years
[1:06:09] God has been looking for do you
[1:06:15] recognize your day of visitation a
[1:06:18] [Music]
[1:06:21] certain hour of restoration watch this
[1:06:29] in burnt offerings of sacrifice of a
[1:06:32] scene that has no pleasure then said I'd
[1:06:36] look at Christ's words back to God
[1:06:38] knowing how to talk back to God
[1:06:40] no I come in the volume of the book it
[1:06:43] is written of me to do that we love Lord
[1:06:47] he knew he was the fullness of the book
[1:06:50] and he came to fulfill the fullness of
[1:06:53] the book you and I can't fulfill the
[1:06:58] fullness of the book for the brand said
[1:07:01] but you can't fulfill the word for your
[1:07:02] age and that's what God is looking for
[1:07:06] where you try to go to the cross and
[1:07:08] died for me and be accepted you try to
[1:07:11] go to Israel and preach behold Messiah
[1:07:13] is coming they'll never accept you but
[1:07:16] there is a part that can be accepted and
[1:07:18] it's departing to God a predestinated
[1:07:20] for your age you have to recognize your
[1:07:24] hour of visitation and recognize your
[1:07:27] our brother Mike is to be restored in
[1:07:30] our hour something in the church was
[1:07:34] lost just like the first Eve when God
[1:07:36] came down to the first e something had
[1:07:38] been lost but God had the ability to get
[1:07:40] it back and what Satan had to see that a
[1:07:44] normal Church God with his bride has the
[1:07:46] ability to get it back
[1:07:50] but you've got to know it's yours now
[1:07:56] won't you watch this he was the man
[1:08:00] Christ was a man would have commissioned
[1:08:02] in a purpose he had a purpose like Adam
[1:08:05] he had a purpose like he Eve had a
[1:08:08] purpose he had a purpose like Moses but
[1:08:11] Jesus Christ newest purpose and he knew
[1:08:14] that his call was by predestination not
[1:08:17] just gifted or you follow me
[1:08:20] Balaam was dead not just anointed Judas
[1:08:24] was dead once you watch this but by
[1:08:27] predestination by God Jesus Christ had a
[1:08:30] calling and a purpose in that calling to
[1:08:32] be fulfilled
[1:08:33] looking for the bam sentimental birth
[1:08:35] brains he said watch how it's were
[1:08:38] portrayed in Jacob watch how it was
[1:08:40] portrayed in Joseph exactly loved of his
[1:08:43] brother loved it was giving love of his
[1:08:44] father hated by his brother and without
[1:08:46] a cause he was spiritual could foretell
[1:08:48] things and interpret dreams he couldn't
[1:08:51] help being that now I want to get this
[1:08:57] to you I don't want this to go by you if
[1:08:58] you're predestinated don't worry about
[1:09:03] it
[1:09:04] you cannot help be what you are because
[1:09:08] God made you that God is not trying to
[1:09:14] predestinate you God isn't trying to get
[1:09:17] you to accept what you were
[1:09:18] predestinated for he turned down with
[1:09:22] shira destined to fall but in our
[1:09:23] restoration he's restored to us the
[1:09:26] revelation of what you have
[1:09:27] predestinated for and why he put you in
[1:09:30] this hour and not the person oh I love
[1:09:36] the big magnet and see Paul preached I
[1:09:38] love that badesti John the Baptist I
[1:09:40] have loved to be with the multitude when
[1:09:44] Jesus gave the fiction bread
[1:09:45] fishing fishing bread but brother Brown
[1:09:48] said but what a greater age this is what
[1:09:53] a greater age
[1:09:54] this is now once you watch
[1:10:00] he was spiritually he could foretell
[1:10:03] things and interpret dreams he could not
[1:10:07] help being that he was just born that he
[1:10:10] was predestinated to be that and once
[1:10:14] you watch this that predestination gave
[1:10:18] Joseph and Jacob a hunger that's what
[1:10:22] I'm getting to they had a Hunger the
[1:10:25] hunger wasn't for meat and drink because
[1:10:29] the New Testament said that the kingdom
[1:10:32] of God is not meat and drink their
[1:10:36] hunger was for something different when
[1:10:40] Jesus Christ said I hunger to do my
[1:10:42] father's will the disciple said is that
[1:10:43] because we have taken no bread Jesus I'm
[1:10:45] not talking about natural meat the pre
[1:10:49] decimated have a hunger to find and to
[1:10:53] do the will of the one that put him here
[1:10:57] Moses in the desert forty years and
[1:10:59] cannot forget that hunger or the cry of
[1:11:02] the people why the predestination was
[1:11:04] going to stay there until satisfied that
[1:11:06] hunger I want you to watch this
[1:11:13] it's a hunger it's not a natural
[1:11:15] predestination
[1:11:16] that's what Matthew 5:6 says blessed are
[1:11:19] they which do hunger and thirst after
[1:11:22] righteousness for they shall be filled
[1:11:24] Wow that hunger is a predestinated seed
[1:11:27] in you that's hungry for the word to be
[1:11:30] fulfilled and nobody can take your place
[1:11:32] brother Brown said you were chosen to
[1:11:34] fulfill that part of the word now I'm
[1:11:40] talking to you have you hungry if you're
[1:11:42] not hungry it's time to pray cuz I ain't
[1:11:48] satisfied I'm not I'm hungry I'm hungry
[1:11:53] for something here brother Mike I'm
[1:11:55] hungry for something a spoken word
[1:11:56] Tabernacle I'm hungry for something in
[1:11:59] living word Tabernacle I hope they don't
[1:12:02] get me stolen could God restore
[1:12:07] what we were Zeeland if you did are you
[1:12:11] following me I am NOT looking to see any
[1:12:15] lost but it's not my decision it's his
[1:12:21] I'm hungry for something it's for the
[1:12:25] promise of this age I be confirmed and
[1:12:28] it has not been confirmed that I layer
[1:12:31] to see a messenger he was confirmed but
[1:12:34] we're in a different age we're at
[1:12:36] different people called out for a
[1:12:38] different manifestation it was the one
[1:12:43] God pulled out of there but now he's
[1:12:46] gone who's going to finish the course
[1:12:49] working God found another one like that
[1:12:51] one could be sold surrender in his hand
[1:12:54] he could do in you sister he could do in
[1:12:58] you young man what he did in that one
[1:13:00] are you following me when God took most
[1:13:03] of the scene the Commission was not
[1:13:04] finished they were still a Joshua
[1:13:07] Commission to be confirmed but God needs
[1:13:10] a Joshua to confirm the Commission you
[1:13:13] do not have a Joshua he's the Holy Ghost
[1:13:15] and he's looking for somebody tougher
[1:13:17] fields on Commission but it's only for
[1:13:21] the hungry for it
[1:13:23] c'était by you all for nothing not a
[1:13:25] better job not more money not a pretty
[1:13:28] away not a better look at husband he
[1:13:30] can't buy you all for nothing because
[1:13:32] something in your heart is not satisfied
[1:13:33] you say God there's more the Holy Ghost
[1:13:35] to be received and I'll know it when I
[1:13:43] see it the message listening learning
[1:13:48] the message doesn't create the hunger
[1:13:52] I'm going to say this now listen but the
[1:13:56] hunger would drive you into prayer and
[1:13:58] desperation like it is real when they
[1:14:03] wanted to get out even they might
[1:14:05] enjoyed the leeks for a little while but
[1:14:09] they came a day where they didn't
[1:14:11] satisfied no more I might enjoy a nice
[1:14:14] call for a while my wife if I could give
[1:14:17] him one with Jordan nice house for a
[1:14:18] while they would never
[1:14:20] if your predestinated they were never
[1:14:22] satisfied brother man chrétien 2 meses
[1:14:26] thirst he said God put in every man to
[1:14:28] thirst to him but the elect has even a
[1:14:31] different thirst
[1:14:32] it's a hunger force of righteousness for
[1:14:35] the BAM said every man hungry for God
[1:14:37] many are called but there's a special
[1:14:40] hunger in the predestinated their chosen
[1:14:43] they're chosen to fulfill a particular
[1:14:46] function in the age in which they live
[1:14:48] and the Holy Ghost seeks those people
[1:14:50] out but the brandman said to make love
[1:14:51] with him or brood over them until he
[1:14:55] produces in them the thing that they
[1:14:57] were created for and every man does not
[1:14:58] have that seed to come under there
[1:15:00] brooding are you following me
[1:15:02] when the Holy Ghost brood over the earth
[1:15:04] you found pine trees table you're not a
[1:15:06] con trees table but why didn't the coal
[1:15:08] ash come up why didn't the pyrite come
[1:15:11] up there was no life in the pyrite of
[1:15:13] coal ash to come up but everything that
[1:15:15] had a life of God it came up as the Holy
[1:15:17] Ghost was bruton now I want you to watch
[1:15:21] I don't want to keep you much longer I'm
[1:15:23] gonna finish this talk let's go to
[1:15:26] Romans 8 Romans 8 we're in our
[1:15:32] restoration the Holy Ghost is brewed and
[1:15:35] he's causing the truth of God to hunger
[1:15:40] for hunger we want something more when
[1:15:47] we get what we want that more than our
[1:15:49] food now we're getting close we get we
[1:15:53] want what God has read it out pull so
[1:15:56] Satan has nothing else he can offer you
[1:15:59] your interest sister bridgetta I say out
[1:16:03] of get in touch I gotta get hold of him
[1:16:05] nothing else sister was satisfying
[1:16:08] are you following even Christ is going
[1:16:11] to cavalry he had another desire he was
[1:16:16] a man he said father if they be any
[1:16:21] other way brother BEM said he wasn't
[1:16:23] trying to bypass Calvary he said he just
[1:16:25] wasn't ready to depart yet he was really
[1:16:27] starting to enjoy the fellowship with
[1:16:29] his friends he said God would just give
[1:16:32] me a little bit more time my friends I
[1:16:34] go but give me a little bit more time he
[1:16:36] was a man there was something on earth
[1:16:38] that even Christ desired and it was
[1:16:41] fellowship with those that loved him he
[1:16:46] said but nevertheless not my will when
[1:16:49] you're willing to sacrifice the thing
[1:16:50] that's closer to your heart not my will
[1:16:52] but I will be done
[1:16:54] now you're ready to move it to your
[1:16:56] position I want you to watch this Romans
[1:17:00] 8:28 and we know that all things work
[1:17:03] together for good to them that love God
[1:17:04] to them who are the called according to
[1:17:07] his purpose that's what I'm getting that
[1:17:09] his purpose for whom he did foreknow he
[1:17:12] did also predestinate to be conformed to
[1:17:15] the image of his son that's the word in
[1:17:17] their age that he might be the firstborn
[1:17:20] among many brethren moreover whom he did

[1:29:58] step to go I got leaves one more step to

[1:30:03] quote he says the last day is here
[1:30:07] notice let's look back again I can't
[1:30:10] pass all this see I just want to look
[1:30:12] here just a minute now and we're close
[1:30:15] in a few minutes just give me your
[1:30:17] undivided attention for a minute now
[1:30:20] Colossians the 4:18 chapter in the book
[1:30:22] of Colossians here now he is the head of
[1:30:24] the church the body now remember an ease
[1:30:27] hour of restoration God had to turn her
[1:30:30] heart back to Adam who he made her
[1:30:32] headship that was her our restoration
[1:30:36] now in this hour the church in the first
[1:30:38] age the Bible said lost her first love
[1:30:40] which was her headship for a short
[1:30:43] period of time Christ actually had
[1:30:45] preeminence in his Gentile church but
[1:30:48] before the first age was concluded not
[1:30:50] necessarily in Paul's and Peter time for
[1:30:52] the BAM said because the age lasted
[1:30:53] beyond their lifespan but maybe beyond
[1:30:56] beyond beyond their life till the first
[1:30:58] age he said the church began to cool off
[1:31:00] and relax just a little bit but come for
[1:31:03] more what was it and God rebuked him and
[1:31:05] said ye have left your first love which
[1:31:08] means somewhere down the line God's got
[1:31:10] to take that bride and bring her back to
[1:31:12] the original faith original one-on-one
[1:31:15] with God that she had is there Pentecost
[1:31:16] where no man would come and join
[1:31:18] themselves to them because God was being
[1:31:19] glorified in his church and brother
[1:31:22] Brown said and I'm looking for those
[1:31:24] days of Ananias and Sapphira God to
[1:31:27] manifest like that to come back again
[1:31:29] and that will come into full hour of
[1:31:31] restoration but not what he says
[1:31:36] for the Benham reason description now
[1:31:38] here's the head of the church the body
[1:31:40] who was the beginning the first born of
[1:31:42] dead that in all things he might have
[1:31:44] preeminence preeminence where in his
[1:31:47] church he is the hand of the turn that
[1:31:50] his brother Brent non-scripted now this
[1:31:51] is him saying he is the head of the
[1:31:53] church which is the body and he wants
[1:31:56] the preeminence I make my confession
[1:32:05] one of the things that I don't pray
[1:32:07] about as much tissue it but it comes
[1:32:09] with my heart from time to time it's
[1:32:11] keep waving love the Lord with all that
[1:32:13] hard all that soul but all not man with
[1:32:18] all that's trending if a man surrenders
[1:32:21] death what else for the robber does he
[1:32:22] have loved the Lord that dark with all
[1:32:26] that heart
[1:32:28] all that soul all that man everything
[1:32:33] you think about and all that strength
[1:32:36] everything you've got in this body what
[1:32:39] else we have with a climber what does we
[1:32:42] got God has all of you what can God do
[1:32:49] with a man if he can get all them little
[1:32:51] David I believe he can show Jesus Christ
[1:32:55] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:32:59] Morita's quote I've got a few more
[1:33:01] allows him let you go he says listen now
[1:33:06] listen close why we're going what he is
[1:33:09] to be the head of the body his Brides
[1:33:12] body which is taken from him flesh and
[1:33:15] bone like in Adam see Bride God has a
[1:33:20] purpose tip of field like Adams give me
[1:33:23] late Adam and his bride the same way God
[1:33:26] took out of Adam his bride you and I
[1:33:29] have come out of Christ his bride she
[1:33:32] left what was brought back the bride
[1:33:36] left but in this age the word has
[1:33:38] brought her back that's what we're
[1:33:41] hungry for but we got to recognize the
[1:33:48] hour of our restoration and I prayed
[1:33:51] that the hunger the greatest hunger that
[1:33:53] any of you have right now is to find
[1:33:56] your place in that restoration don't
[1:33:58] struggle with your ability say God give
[1:34:01] me a revelation of what you've given in
[1:34:05] my place in it and then you rest on what
[1:34:08] he promised you Lou
[1:34:10] when Ruth was an hour for restoration
[1:34:12] all she did listen Church them frozen
[1:34:15] was X go back and read a book a roof you
[1:34:19] find what she did anything more she
[1:34:21] asked when she went to Boaz and laid at
[1:34:24] his feet and she made her petitions
[1:34:26] known he looked down at him and he said
[1:34:29] I'll be back and she wouldn't old hope
[1:34:32] mother-in-law what had happened and and
[1:34:35] they said don't worry the mail not rest
[1:34:39] there's not an eye on you no more here
[1:34:42] not rest until the job is done

[1:35:33] how forgive each of us forgive me you
[1:35:38] know what kind of effect the world can
[1:35:40] have on a man and you even told us by
[1:35:43] your prophet that a man is not capable
[1:35:45] of keeping a covenant so you wouldn't
[1:35:48] put your trust even in that the Lord you
[1:35:51] gave each one of us an unconditional
[1:35:52] covenant a promise that put our name on
[1:35:55] the Lamb's Book of Life before the
[1:35:57] foundation of the world and you promise
[1:35:59] that they'll be not one of those that
[1:36:00] have been lost and to ensure it's you

[1:36:23] each one of us that caused us to turn
[1:36:25] our minds and our hearts to different
[1:36:27] things that are not ordained according
[1:36:29] to your will
[1:36:30] God may you purify our hearts may you
[1:36:34] open up all our confusion of our mind
[1:36:35] and get us off of the drunken things
[1:36:37] that it's like Lord that your word might
[1:36:39] be able to shine in our hearts and Lord
[1:36:42] that you might be glorified in us God
[1:36:45] give us such a sweet anointing that we

[1:36:49] act different because they recognize the
[1:36:51] atmosphere has changed it's not our tone
[1:36:54] of voice but God as the spirit that's
[1:36:56] moving with us and in us and around us
[1:36:58] God let this world be so impacted O God
[1:37:01] by your presence in us Lord that they'll

[1:41:17] our men are you a child of the king I
[1:41:21] mean are you a recipient of the life of
[1:41:24] God a man that has been passed in this
[1:41:27] hour praise God you know I was just
[1:41:31] teaching my family a little bit last
[1:41:33] night about you know just the importance
[1:41:36] of the message and you know I'm not
[1:41:40] gonna get into all of it I'm like along
[1:41:41] the time but you know just what brother
[1:41:43] Mike said this morning was was very
[1:41:45] powerful very good he made a lot of good
[1:41:48] statements in it you know to the family
[1:41:50] I was like it sometimes it's like you
[1:41:52] know two different seeds right one seed
[1:41:55] they both look exactly alike on the
[1:41:58] outside you can't tell any difference
[1:41:59] but one of them has life in it and the
[1:42:03] other one is just a dead seed a man and
[1:42:05] so that's well
[1:42:06] so much of the time we get caught up in
[1:42:09] the word that the Lord gave me was
[1:42:11] symbol it's we get caught up in the
[1:42:13] semblance of the message the outward
[1:42:15] appearance of the message but yet we
[1:42:17] fail to recognize the reality we fail to
[1:42:19] recognize the life that God is fraught
[1:42:22] and that is the message amen the opening
[1:42:25] of the Seventh Seal all these things
[1:42:27] immense that is the message to the bride
[1:42:30] have you been a recipient of that amen
[1:42:32] are you a child of the king hey you have
[1:42:34] you received the shout of the King in
[1:42:37] your heart amen can you bear witness
[1:42:39] saying I am predestinated I am the one
[1:42:43] that's gonna fulfill a man was what was
[1:42:46] predetermined by God to be fulfilled in
[1:42:48] this hour amen praise God and he's
[1:42:51] looking for faith and the proper said
[1:42:53] that rapturing faith lies in the tape
[1:42:55] sitting in the book say man amen and
[1:42:57] praise God hallelujah
[1:42:58] praise God I'm not gonna throw a lot of
[1:43:00] the time I'm in but I'm happy how many
[1:43:02] tapping to be here amen how many still
[1:43:05] on the Lord's side how many still
[1:43:06] pressing the battle are you there still
[1:43:09] in the internet hookup are you pressing
[1:43:10] the battle amen have you got the victory
[1:43:13] in this hour
[1:43:14] praise God amen we are overcomers amen
[1:43:17] we are overcomers hallelujah we're not
[1:43:21] going to succumb to the pressure of this
[1:43:24] age but we are going to rise above the
[1:43:27] pressure of this age a man God knows how
[1:43:29] to crank the pressure up when the Eagles
[1:43:31] that have been predestinated to fly know
[1:43:34] how to set their wings in the pressure
[1:43:36] and soar above a man to rise further and
[1:43:39] further in mind of Christ and the power
[1:43:42] of the hour amen
[1:43:43] praise God hallelujah so we're not gonna
[1:43:46] succumb to fear we're not gonna succumb
[1:43:47] to anxiety temptation pressure any kind
[1:43:51] of chaos of this hour because the
[1:43:53] scripture says that he that abides in
[1:43:55] the shadow of the Almighty
[1:43:57] Amen all these things do you there'll be
[1:43:59] a thousand to fall by they left 10,000
[1:44:02] by that right but it shall not come nigh

[1:44:05] shall come nigh thee amen because he
[1:44:08] knows them that are his yah gonna touch
[1:44:10] you praise God so our confidence is not
