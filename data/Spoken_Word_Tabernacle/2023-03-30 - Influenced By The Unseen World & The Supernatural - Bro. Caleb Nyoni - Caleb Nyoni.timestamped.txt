[40:08] the people and the city is the New
[40:11] Jerusalem did it happen to somebody else
[40:13] or was he only one person
[40:16] because I opened the question and answer
[40:19] box and I saw another question
[40:22] concerning the sermon about the
[40:25] the chair that sister hope so there
[40:30] what was he made out of or something
[40:32] like that whoever put the question
[40:34] didn't write the the name so I don't
[40:36] know who put it but if you did it fine
[40:38] but in other words what I can get by the
[40:41] question is if Heaven is not made out of
[40:44] Mordor or clay why did they have a chair
[40:47] over there that's what I'm getting there
[40:50] everybody okay so we got two choices we
[40:53] can live it and handle it on Sunday
[40:55] before we preach the sermon on Sunday so
[40:58] I can pull the New Jerusalem and show
[41:00] you two New Jerusalem
[41:03] you want to wait till Sunday
[41:05] we want to do it on Sunday right amen so
[41:09] somebody had a question
[41:11] amen so you will see two Jerusalem two
[41:15] New Jerusalem there is a New Jerusalem
[41:17] of people
[41:18] and there is a New Jerusalem office City
[41:20] but you need to read brother Branham
[41:23] very careful
[41:25] yeah amen
[41:27] I was at work and the Holy Spirit gave
[41:29] me a scripture on that and I wonder I
[41:31] say wait a minute I read the scripture
[41:34] over and over and here I can see it now
[41:36] I understand why somebody needed some
[41:39] help so let's hold everything because I
[41:41] have it here I even have coats right

[42:20] you want to refresh yourself for Sunday
[42:22] read First Corinthians chapter 15.
[42:25] just read it and if you don't understand
[42:28] something that's fun but it's very
[42:30] needful because now that the theophan is
[42:32] well established you know what it is now
[42:35] we can dig into how are you going to
[42:38] step into that you're funny

[50:11] diseases some of the problems they just
[50:14] they don't need you to lay hands on you

[50:30] So when you say hallelujah
[50:32] Hallelujah
[50:34] Hallelujah
[50:35] you are beating the foundations of hell
[50:38] remember the words of Jericho there was
[50:42] no hammer there was no Dynamite they
[50:46] were saying hallelujah praise God
[50:48] hallelujah and the world started
[50:51] crumbling down Hallelujah
[50:55] my brother this church I can preach from
[50:59] 1947 to 1965 and this church you say
[51:03] Amen to the word
[51:05] what has brought us together is the
[51:08] message
[51:09] what will keep us together is the
[51:11] message what to separate us is the
[51:14] message so if you want to make me happy
[51:17] give me the message
[51:19] who am I I'm a Son of God this church is
[51:23] not a Pentecostal church this is not a
[51:26] church of chickens don't say clack clack
[51:29] clack but these are spiritual Eagles
[51:33] where the carcasses
[51:35] they're the Eagles be gathered around
[51:39] you are not feeding on the son of man
[51:41] but you are feeding on the body word of
[51:45] being son of man you are feeding on
[51:48] Christ himself
[51:49] so if you are sick tonight you shall be
[51:52] healed if you are hungry tonight you
[51:55] shall be filled I'm sick and tired of
[51:59] believers who sick after signs brother
[52:02] we are in a Seasons where things follow
[52:05] us
[52:06] we are no longer seeking after science
[52:10] sickness does not follow me
[52:12] financial difficulties does not follow
[52:14] me
[52:15] marriage problems does not follow me
[52:18] what follows me is signs wonders and
[52:22] miracles brother when I walk I feel my
[52:24] jacket being pulled and I said what is
[52:27] it he says I am science and I'm wonders
[52:30] I follow those that believe
[52:33] your problem is that you are a believer
[52:35] in my name they shall cast out demons

[52:50] this place in the name of Jesus you
[52:52] spirit of suicide
[52:54] leave this place I believe that somebody
[52:59] today will be healed I believe that
[53:03] somebody who received the Holy Ghost
[53:05] baptism
[53:08] give God a shout out praise
[53:11] [Applause]
[53:15] when the angel came to John
[53:17] when the angel came to join he says Joan
[53:20] come up higher
[53:22] the sister who sang a song she was
[53:24] inspired he says come up higher and John
[53:28] says immediately I was in the spirit
[53:31] brother when you come in the fellowship
[53:33] come up higher immediately receive your
[53:36] healing
[53:37] when you come in the fellowship come up
[53:40] higher immediately receive your body
[53:42] chain
[53:44] Hallelujah
[53:49] [Applause]
[53:52] bro when you come like this
[53:54] we come under the influence of the
[53:56] pillar of Fire
[53:57] I believe there is a man who can turn on
[54:00] the light
[54:01] oh the eyes of Heavens are here watching
[54:05] these audience
[54:06] this is the message of the hour this is
[54:09] the voice of God in these last days
[54:12] brother Branham is the last voice to
[54:15] this generation
[54:16] so when we come like this without any
[54:19] doubt without any feelings without any
[54:22] hatred among us then something is about
[54:25] to happen
[54:26] no devil can stand that presence
[54:29] Hallelujah no kids I can stand that
[54:31] presence
[54:32] no sin no weakness can stand on the way
[54:39] when sister brother Prana wants their
[54:40] sister happy rights house he was sharing
[54:43] the testimony and sister hit right just
[54:45] say brother brother that's nothing by
[54:48] the truth
[54:49] and God says
[54:50] immediately ask what you will brother
[54:54] god like people who respond to this word
[54:57] [Applause]
[55:00] give God a shout out praise
[55:02] [Applause]
[55:09] it's gonna be good here tonight I can
[55:12] feel it already
[55:17] amen
[55:22] I want to thank God for safe traveling
[55:25] Mercies
[55:26] I arrived this morning at this afternoon
[55:29] rather
[55:30] I left at 3am in Texas
[55:33] and I bought it at 5am
[55:36] I only slept for two hours
[55:38] for the past one week I think I've slept
[55:40] for less than 10 hours
[55:42] very busy man
[55:44] but we thank God for the grace
[55:47] that I made it
[55:48] and tomorrow I leave in the morning
[55:52] and I want to bring greetings from my
[55:54] beautiful wife
[55:57] she said I should greet you
[56:01] she just celebrated her birthday some
[56:03] two days ago
[56:05] and we thank God for the gift of life
[56:09] and I also want to bring greetings from
[56:11] my dad and the pastor zunu my coming
[56:14] and uh brother Greg is been such a
[56:17] phenomenal brother to me
[56:20] we met in 2019 in in here in North
[56:23] Carolina and uh we just bonded it's been
[56:26] more than a blessing
[56:28] and he's the one who made it possible
[56:30] and connected me to the man of God he
[56:34] sent me a link some time back I think
[56:36] around 2020 or so and we've been
[56:38] following uh spoken word
[56:41] and I tell you that uh I know I'm not
[56:43] supposed to say this but a whole lot of
[56:46] people in Africa
[56:48] Zambia South Africa and many other
[56:51] countries are watching this church
[56:53] so I want to tell you that you are so
[56:55] blessed to be receiving Direct
[56:58] some are just getting online but you are
[57:01] getting direct
[57:03] so you have to pull the gift from the
[57:05] man of God
[57:06] [Applause]
[57:10] Pastor Steven is an epitome of knowledge
[57:13] if we were in the University would have
[57:16] been one of the PHD doctor lecturers
[57:19] God is really
[57:21] raised a man of God in this generation
[57:26] and I'm so happy with this love he's
[57:28] always communicating you know and uh we
[57:31] can go and on and on but this is a man
[57:33] full of love
[57:35] and brother Branham says the greatest
[57:37] success he had in his ministry was
[57:39] because of divine love
[57:41] knowledge is good but it is not in the
[57:44] same category with love
[57:46] a lot of people seek knowledge from 1200
[57:49] from from the Bible but the Bible says
[57:51] uh knowledge puff it up but love edifies
[57:55] and today we have so much knowledge in
[57:57] 1200 tips but it was love that sent the
[58:01] message
[58:02] 1200 tips reviews the one who is divine
[58:05] love
[58:06] it didn't just give us knowledge to know
[58:08] about him
[58:10] but to know him
[58:12] to know him is life
[58:15] not to know about him
[58:17] to know about him is someone giving you
[58:20] knowledge about somebody else
[58:22] but to know him
[58:24] Hallelujah that means you have to have a
[58:27] personal relationship with God
[58:29] so I pray tonight that more of his love
[58:33] will be shared abroad in our hearts by
[58:36] the Holy Spirit
[58:37] because the seven the sea opened another
[58:40] world to us
[58:42] the seven is still
[58:44] secrets of redemption
[58:46] we see the first six seals is men
[58:48] suffering
[58:50] we see the Festival the White Horse of
[58:52] religious deception
[58:54] that deceived the first church deceived
[58:57] the first Eve and the second Eve
[58:59] the red horse of war and War and
[59:02] bloodshed
[59:03] the black horse of Eco economics
[59:05] feminine death
[59:07] that fourth seal of pestilence
[59:10] that fifth seal which shows the
[59:12] Holocaust
[59:14] that six still points to the vows on
[59:16] Earth
[59:18] points to the tribulation and the battle
[59:21] of Armageddon but the seven the seal
[59:24] shows us how to get back from where we
[59:28] fell from
[59:29] Hallelujah that seven still has been it
[59:33] unveils the Mighty God
[59:36] that seven still reveals Christ in every
[59:39] scripture
[59:40] brother Branham says if you read your
[59:42] Bible and you don't find Jesus Christ go
[59:45] back and read again because it was the
[59:48] entire theme of the whole Bible
[59:50] he says Lord it is written of me I come
[59:52] in the volume of the book and it's from
[59:54] Genesis 1 to Revelations 22. it has been
[59:58] unveiled before us we see him we know
[1:00:02] him we know who he is we know what he is
[1:00:05] today we know who we who he was and we
[1:00:09] know what is to come
[1:00:11] oh that seal that opened to us it takes
[1:00:15] away the Amnesia it makes us see the
[1:00:18] mystery of our names in The Book of Life
[1:00:22] because to know your position is
[1:00:24] connected with perfect faith
[1:00:26] your position is connected to your power
[1:00:29] Revelations 10 8-11 that seventh seal
[1:00:33] book that came from Heaven John was
[1:00:35] taught to eat the book
[1:00:37] there was a time he was in the message
[1:00:40] but when you eat the book the message is
[1:00:43] in you
[1:00:44] he says in that day
[1:00:46] you will know that I in you and you in
[1:00:49] me
[1:00:50] that's why Paul says we have this
[1:00:53] treasure in our Earthly vessels
[1:00:55] Jeremiah says with the title deed in our
[1:00:59] 18 vessels in that type of dude of
[1:01:02] redemption has come down
[1:01:04] and this is the secret the word is in
[1:01:07] the bride
[1:01:08] as Christ was in Mary
[1:01:11] Mary was walking around knowing the
[1:01:14] mystery of Christ was formed inside of
[1:01:16] her
[1:01:17] she knew the prophet's prophecy was
[1:01:20] being formed or interpreted in her life
[1:01:23] when that Mighty Angel descended
[1:01:26] descended and showed her she was the
[1:01:28] Fulfillment of Isaiah 7 14. he says the
[1:01:32] Virgin shall bring forth a son and you
[1:01:34] shall call him Emmanuel
[1:01:36] so she understood
[1:01:38] that this was happening in her life
[1:01:41] so we see haggar was carrying Ishmael
[1:01:44] but ishma was a fighter
[1:01:47] ishma was connected to Abraham
[1:01:50] but he was a mocker he was a persecutor
[1:01:52] his hand was continual against his
[1:01:55] brethren
[1:01:56] but Sarai received a new name
[1:01:59] there were three women in that time next
[1:02:02] slide brother there was haga there was
[1:02:05] Lot's wife
[1:02:06] and they were Sarah
[1:02:08] haggar and Lord's wife didn't receive no
[1:02:11] new name
[1:02:12] but Sarah received a new name
[1:02:15] because Sarah was bringing forth the
[1:02:18] mystery of Christ The Mystery of Isaac
[1:02:22] in Genesis 17 verse 15.
[1:02:26] next Slide the Bible says and God said
[1:02:30] unto Abraham as for thy wife Sarai thou
[1:02:33] shall not call her Sarah
[1:02:36] there it is it says and God said unto
[1:02:39] Abraham as for Sarai that wife
[1:02:45] shall be a name
[1:02:48] so God put an edge in Sarah and an edge
[1:02:51] in Abraham H in Hebrew represent God
[1:03:00] we are being influenced that's my
[1:03:03] message tonight being influenced by the
[1:03:07] Unseen World in the Supernatural
[1:03:12] sensitizing you
[1:03:14] because we are not walking by side
[1:03:16] the one walks by sight moves in the
[1:03:18] temporal but he walks by faith looks to
[1:03:22] the eternal
[1:03:23] because to walk by faith it takes a new
[1:03:26] bed first
[1:03:28] and these little ones who bypass their
[1:03:31] angels that caused the son of man to
[1:03:34] come down
[1:03:35] God being manifested in the flesh to
[1:03:39] make a way to hunt out those who went
[1:03:42] astray and bring us back and connect us
[1:03:46] to our angel
[1:03:49] that is our message tonight
[1:03:52] it's because it's connected to our full
[1:03:54] Redemption
[1:03:57] so I invite you to to open our Bibles to
[1:04:00] Exodus chapter 23
[1:04:06] verse 20. the word Exodus means going
[1:04:09] out
[1:04:11] Exodus is a book of redemption
[1:04:14] so God is speaking to the end to the
[1:04:16] Exodus prophet
[1:04:18] verse 20 behold I send an angel before
[1:04:21] thee to keep thee in the way and to
[1:04:24] bring thee into the place which I have
[1:04:27] prepared
[1:04:29] understand this real good
[1:04:32] these people they were born in Egypt
[1:04:36] and they were born into bondage
[1:04:38] and they were born into slavery
[1:04:41] and Pharaoh a type of Satan held them in
[1:04:45] his kingdom and they couldn't come out
[1:04:49] they were slaves there but God promised
[1:04:52] the Deliverance
[1:04:54] and he's sending Moses and Moses is a
[1:04:57] type of Christ
[1:04:59] who is coming to deliver them out of
[1:05:01] bondage where they were burning
[1:05:04] to bring them into a place that God had
[1:05:08] promised them
[1:05:09] they should have been born in that place
[1:05:12] but Pharaoh dealt subtle with them
[1:05:16] after the death of Joseph
[1:05:18] he made them slaves and these people in
[1:05:22] bondage is receiving up an exodus
[1:05:24] Prophet with the message
[1:05:26] and is said to deliver them out of the
[1:05:29] evil system
[1:05:30] and bring them into a place prepared for
[1:05:34] them
[1:05:35] and this same Pillar of Fire
[1:05:37] is sent to guide them
[1:05:40] from where they were born in bondage
[1:05:42] into a place prepared for them
[1:05:46] behold I send an angel before them
[1:05:48] before they to keep thee in the way to
[1:05:51] bring thee in the place which I have
[1:05:53] prepared
[1:05:55] 21 Bill beware of him
[1:05:58] and his beware of him and his and obey
[1:06:01] his voice provoke him not for he will
[1:06:04] not pardon your transgressions
[1:06:06] for my name is in there
[1:06:09] but if Thou shalt indeed obey his voice
[1:06:12] and do all that I speak then I will be
[1:06:16] an enemy to your enemies in an
[1:06:19] anniversary unto thine adversaries
[1:06:23] enemy is not the one who afflict the
[1:06:26] body
[1:06:27] but an enemy is the one who oppressed
[1:06:29] the mind
[1:06:31] enemy is the one who bring false
[1:06:34] religion into their soul
[1:06:37] but I will be an enemy to your enemies
[1:06:42] he says for my angel shall go before
[1:06:44] thee and bring thee unto the amorites
[1:06:46] unto the Hittites unto the parasites and
[1:06:50] unto the Canaanites and unto the he
[1:06:52] writes and unto the jebusites and I will
[1:06:56] cut them off
[1:06:59] may God bless the reading of the word
[1:07:01] 10 with me to John 14.
[1:07:05] in the book of Exodus in the time of
[1:07:08] Moses that was the first Exodus
[1:07:12] God was bringing the people from a
[1:07:14] natural land to a natural land
[1:07:17] from Egypt and to Canaan
[1:07:20] but in the second Exodus
[1:07:24] which was the great Exodus
[1:07:26] because Christ was a greater Moses who
[1:07:30] was taking them from a spiritual
[1:07:32] condition of Judaism
[1:07:35] taking us from that flesh birth
[1:07:38] to bring us into the Holy Ghost
[1:07:40] to bring us into the new birth
[1:07:42] this was a spiritual Exodus
[1:07:45] and today we are living in the Third
[1:07:47] Exodus
[1:07:50] so in John 14
[1:07:52] Jesus had come to this juncture of his
[1:07:54] ministry
[1:07:56] and he's about to go to the cross
[1:07:58] so the healing Revival was over
[1:08:01] and the first pull contacted the flesh
[1:08:03] demonology in the Physical Realm
[1:08:07] and the second pool designing the
[1:08:10] secrets of the heart
[1:08:11] going into the spirit man
[1:08:14] demonology in the spirit Realm
[1:08:17] uncovering things inside of them
[1:08:19] like you talk to the woman and says you
[1:08:22] have five husbands like you'd expose the
[1:08:25] thoughts of the Pharisees
[1:08:27] when they call when they were calling to
[1:08:30] discernment mental telepathy
[1:08:33] then in that said pool the opening of
[1:08:35] the word caught the very elect
[1:08:39] but now he's about to be rejected and go
[1:08:42] to the cross and he's telling these
[1:08:44] disciples to say let no let not your
[1:08:47] heart be troubled
[1:08:49] believe in also in me he says in my
[1:08:52] father's house are many mansions
[1:08:55] brother I feel like preaching already
[1:09:00] if it were not so I would have told you
[1:09:03] I got to prepare a place for you
[1:09:06] and if I got to prepare a place I'll
[1:09:08] come again and receive you unto myself
[1:09:11] that where I am you may be also
[1:09:15] then Thomas said unto him Lord we know
[1:09:19] that we're not
[1:09:21] not without ghost how do we know the way
[1:09:24] then Jesus said unto him let's say
[1:09:27] together I am the way I am the truth I
[1:09:31] am the life no man coming to the father
[1:09:34] but by me Clap Your Hands for Jesus
[1:09:40] so without the way there is no going
[1:09:44] without the truth there is no knowing
[1:09:48] without the life there is no living
[1:09:53] the way is seven steps to God
[1:09:56] the truth is seven voices
[1:10:00] the life is Seven Virtues
[1:10:03] the whole Plan of Redemption laid in the
[1:10:05] son of man
[1:10:07] Hallelujah he was the Super sign
[1:10:10] he was the head of a new creation
[1:10:13] he came by the Virgin birth
[1:10:16] the serpent seed brought before
[1:10:18] and every one of us died in Adam when he
[1:10:21] died
[1:10:22] Moses couldn't redeem us
[1:10:24] Elijah couldn't redeem us Jeremiah
[1:10:27] couldn't redeem us Isaiah couldn't
[1:10:29] redeem us John the greatest man born of
[1:10:31] a woman couldn't redeem us
[1:10:33] so the serpent seed made a way for the
[1:10:36] Virgin birth
[1:10:37] but the Virgin birth made their way for
[1:10:40] the Incarnation of God
[1:10:42] the Creator
[1:10:45] by creation created a body and came and
[1:10:49] stabbed into that body for Redemption to
[1:10:53] redeem his Fallen creation
[1:10:55] so he is the way he is the truth and is
[1:10:58] the life
[1:11:00] no man coming to the father but by me
[1:11:05] so each one of us who is elected is an
[1:11:08] angel beholding your father's face in
[1:11:10] heaven
[1:11:11] he says I got to prepare a place for you
[1:11:16] in my father's house are many mansions
[1:11:19] brother sister
[1:11:21] theologians they couldn't decode that
[1:11:24] they thought it's the seven bedroomed
[1:11:25] house with an ensuite one brother Panama
[1:11:29] went to the sixth Dimension he said
[1:11:32] Heaven Is Not What Mama thought it was
[1:11:35] these are bodies
[1:11:37] though this edit Tabernacle peaches off
[1:11:39] we have another building
[1:11:41] another Mansion waiting for you
[1:11:44] [Applause]
[1:11:48] but to get to that body
[1:11:51] we accept here
[1:11:53] by the old bed in a fallen condition
[1:11:57] and the law of corruption is in this
[1:11:59] body
[1:12:00] and this Fallen body
[1:12:02] is bound in time by the law of
[1:12:05] gravitation
[1:12:09] because this body that we have
[1:12:12] trapped because it's part of this Earth
[1:12:15] the Bible says Dash Thou shalt dust Thou
[1:12:17] Art and thou shall return
[1:12:21] and we are held in a dimension called
[1:12:23] time
[1:12:24] and we are growing old and trying to
[1:12:27] come out of this dimension
[1:12:30] couldn't take us out motor car couldn't
[1:12:33] take us out airplane couldn't take us
[1:12:36] out Luther Wesley and Pentecostal
[1:12:39] message couldn't take us out
[1:12:41] what's in back he couldn't take us out
[1:12:43] but in this astronaut age in this equal
[1:12:47] age seven Thunders uttered their voices
[1:12:51] Hallelujah to reveal to us the way to
[1:12:54] come from flesh to word
[1:12:57] like Enoch walked the pyramid was the
[1:13:00] second Bible
[1:13:02] the first Bible was the zodiac
[1:13:05] the second Bible was the pyramid
[1:13:07] and the third Bible is the Britain Bible
[1:13:09] that we have and brother pranam says we
[1:13:12] are living in the 22nd chapter of the
[1:13:15] Book of Revelations
[1:13:17] we are living in the edge of the caption
[1:13:19] of the pyramid
[1:13:20] we have three Bibles but one author
[1:13:23] and the Bible is a Plan of Redemption
[1:13:26] [Music]
[1:13:28] in the first Bible it starts with Virgo
[1:13:32] the Virgin shall bring forth a man child
[1:13:35] and he was the Lamb of God Aries the
[1:13:38] lamb that had to die
[1:13:41] unfolding all these Mysteries to Leo the
[1:13:44] Lion when he comes into his kingdom
[1:13:47] and brother pranam says we are living in
[1:13:49] the end time of three Bibles
[1:13:52] in Enoch's Bible
[1:13:54] there is a way to come from faith into
[1:13:56] the king's chamber
[1:13:59] and in the king's chamber there is an
[1:14:01] empty coffer
[1:14:03] showing death is conquered
[1:14:06] six times in the Book of Genesis
[1:14:08] it tells you in chapter 5 and Adam died
[1:14:11] and Mahalia died and Seth died and
[1:14:15] Kenneth died and lamict died but when it
[1:14:18] comes to Enoch says he was not
[1:14:21] Allelujah six ages died to go to heaven
[1:14:26] Enoch was the seventh from the first
[1:14:28] Adam but in this hour this halleluia the
[1:14:33] seventh from the first second Adam there
[1:14:36] is a people in Charlotte who received
[1:14:39] the opening of The Seven the seal
[1:14:40] [Applause]
[1:14:42] seven Thunders utter their voices
[1:14:45] a mystery to show us how to prepare for
[1:14:48] translation faith
[1:14:50] the opening of the word gives us Faith
[1:14:52] to be changed
[1:14:54] to lose us from time
[1:14:56] to change our bodies so we can move from
[1:14:59] time into eternity
[1:15:01] rather this is the hour the church is to
[1:15:03] be raptured this is the hour this Mortal
[1:15:07] body will put on immortality
[1:15:10] Jesus said I got to prepare a place for
[1:15:12] you
[1:15:13] and I will come again
[1:15:15] he didn't say I'll come with a shout a
[1:15:18] voice and a trump
[1:15:20] but when he showed pull that mystery
[1:15:23] oh my God Paul saw it as a three-fold
[1:15:27] mystery
[1:15:28] and in festivals for power speaking of
[1:15:31] Jesus coming again with a shout a voice
[1:15:34] and a trump
[1:15:36] and in second Thessalonians 1 he says
[1:15:39] and when Jesus is revealed with his
[1:15:43] mighty Angels inflaming fire from heaven
[1:15:47] and when Jesus
[1:15:51] can I preach to you
[1:15:53] is being revealed
[1:15:56] in flaming fire with these Mighty angels
[1:15:59] when it comes to be glorified in his
[1:16:02] Saints
[1:16:03] they have to come into glorification to
[1:16:06] change Dimensions so rapturing Faith
[1:16:09] lays in the message
[1:16:11] it must be taken from the message books
[1:16:14] and tips and put in us so that Rapture
[1:16:16] in faith comes in US
[1:16:20] so there is something ministers in the
[1:16:23] message have to find
[1:16:25] because Luther read the same Bible that
[1:16:28] brother Branham read
[1:16:30] but Luther only saw justification
[1:16:33] he took out the material and went and
[1:16:36] made horse and buggy
[1:16:38] Wesley saw a little more than Luther
[1:16:41] he went and met a motor car
[1:16:45] but they were based on the fundamental
[1:16:47] teachings
[1:16:48] but the church was still EarthBound
[1:16:51] but the Pentecostals started seeing the
[1:16:53] gifts of the Spirit
[1:16:55] something to go in the Supernatural
[1:16:58] Allelujah the spirit of God coming down
[1:17:01] into people and giving them divine
[1:17:03] utterances
[1:17:05] so as man was discovering truth in the
[1:17:08] Bible the church was advancing
[1:17:11] and the Wright brothers discovered
[1:17:14] material in the same Earth
[1:17:16] that those scientists who made the will
[1:17:19] of the horse and buggy and who made the
[1:17:22] motor car was sick they were studied
[1:17:25] something seeing something in this going
[1:17:28] up into the air
[1:17:29] are we together
[1:17:31] they were now getting into the Heavenly
[1:17:34] places
[1:17:34] getting into this Supernatural
[1:17:36] atmosphere
[1:17:38] but the problem is planes only fly
[1:17:40] around
[1:17:41] but listen there was one who came who
[1:17:44] started looking for materials Luther
[1:17:46] Wesleyan Pentecostals couldn't find in
[1:17:49] the Bible
[1:17:50] he found something more than
[1:17:51] justification modern sanctification more
[1:17:55] than the gift of the spirit
[1:17:56] and he began to find the kind of man
[1:17:59] that God
[1:18:01] made in the Bible
[1:18:04] and back in the Garden of Eden
[1:18:07] he found how the fog came by the serpent
[1:18:10] seed
[1:18:11] he began to understand why Jesus
[1:18:13] couldn't be born by sex
[1:18:15] he found what condition new bed will
[1:18:19] bring a man into
[1:18:21] he found out that only elect could be
[1:18:23] eternal
[1:18:26] because God is in eternal
[1:18:28] he found out that we bypassed our
[1:18:31] theophany
[1:18:32] when we were created we're supposed to
[1:18:34] come from thoughts to word to flesh but
[1:18:37] the main point of a woman goes from
[1:18:39] thoughts to flesh bypassing the word
[1:18:44] this is
[1:18:46] found out that only the redeemed of
[1:18:48] angels
[1:18:50] and all these materials was in the Earth
[1:18:54] and we see how science has advanced by
[1:18:57] the natural achievements by natural
[1:19:00] scientists working with the natural
[1:19:02] scientists in the natural Realm
[1:19:05] was a shadow a type of spiritual
[1:19:08] scientist working by spiritual laws with
[1:19:12] spiritual elements of the Bible the word
[1:19:15] the mystery truths to bring back the
[1:19:18] church into his astronaut age
[1:19:22] and is the great Albert Einstein of this
[1:19:25] age
[1:19:27] the national Albert Einstein
[1:19:29] found that the center of the universe he
[1:19:33] found the center of the universe
[1:19:35] are we together
[1:19:37] the natural Albert Einstein says men
[1:19:41] have got power to create
[1:19:43] but he is the spiritual Albert anything
[1:19:48] who created
[1:19:50] whoa
[1:19:51] like what God did back in Eden when he
[1:19:55] said let there be light and he created
[1:19:57] spirals
[1:19:59] and he laid everything in 1200 tapes
[1:20:02] [Music]
[1:20:04] these experiments
[1:20:06] of spiritual scientists must be raised
[1:20:09] in our local churches
[1:20:12] in each Church we're supposed to have
[1:20:14] spiritual scientists finding these
[1:20:16] materials in the message
[1:20:18] and raising the church into a
[1:20:20] supernatural atmosphere
[1:20:23] brother pranam says science has taken
[1:20:26] the natural man further in his five
[1:20:29] senses than ministers have taken the
[1:20:32] church into the soul
[1:20:34] [Applause]
[1:20:36] this is the problem in the message today
[1:20:39] people they don't know what age they are
[1:20:42] living in
[1:20:43] they don't know what anointing has come
[1:20:45] down in this day
[1:20:47] we are in the restoration age and the
[1:20:50] ego anointing has come down
[1:20:52] and we are seeing so many with the
[1:20:54] reformer anointing
[1:20:57] we see a lot of people congregated but
[1:20:59] not under preparation for translation
[1:21:02] faith
[1:21:03] [Music]
[1:21:05] when you get into the message or among
[1:21:07] believers you should see a church raised
[1:21:10] up into the Heavenly places
[1:21:13] people awakened to the Unseen World and
[1:21:17] the supernatural
[1:21:18] people looking to the Unseen
[1:21:21] like Elisha yet the Young gehazi
[1:21:25] together in the crisis came
[1:21:28] and one has the right anointing
[1:21:30] and the other one is the connection with
[1:21:32] Elijah
[1:21:34] and the Unseen World was opened to him
[1:21:37] and the other one could only tell
[1:21:39] stories like gehazi you could tell when
[1:21:42] the prophet was born
[1:21:44] you could tell how the angel talked to
[1:21:46] him in the river
[1:21:48] he could talk about how he met the angel
[1:21:50] in the cave
[1:21:52] he can talk about the commission but
[1:21:55] he's not in the same atmosphere
[1:21:57] in what the prophet was in
[1:22:02] but in the days after Elijah was gone
[1:22:05] Elisha was working with these materials
[1:22:07] Elijah gave him
[1:22:09] and he was walking in the Supernatural
[1:22:11] atmosphere
[1:22:15] watch these two men one is walking by
[1:22:18] side
[1:22:19] and one is walking by faith one is
[1:22:22] looking to the Unseen
[1:22:23] and the other is only seeing the
[1:22:25] political disturbances and the Armed
[1:22:28] Forces
[1:22:30] Elisha knew the Angels was all around
[1:22:32] him
[1:22:34] he didn't have to tell the prophet to
[1:22:36] feel that because the prophet was gone
[1:22:39] look after Jesus went of the scene
[1:22:42] Paul talking to the angel Peter led by
[1:22:46] the angel Philip led by the angel why
[1:22:49] because they understood the message
[1:22:51] right
[1:22:53] because Jesus opened up demonology
[1:22:57] he says when the unclean Spirit lives
[1:22:59] leaves the place it will come back to
[1:23:02] the it will come back and the demons had
[1:23:04] known Jesus and Paul
[1:23:06] when discussions of skeva came
[1:23:10] they opened the book and said in the
[1:23:12] name of Jesus
[1:23:14] who published
[1:23:16] and the demon says we know Jesus
[1:23:18] we know Paul but who is you
[1:23:23] Hallelujah I'm showing you what realm we
[1:23:26] are in
[1:23:29] watch Elijah or Elisha after Elijah
[1:23:34] and watch the apostles after the days of
[1:23:36] the son of man
[1:23:37] we had Elijah and we had the son of man
[1:23:41] so notice two spiritual scientists
[1:23:44] the spiritual scientists must take us
[1:23:46] into that realm of rupturing faith
[1:23:50] and brother brother was disappointed
[1:23:53] and he says what's the matter with the
[1:23:55] church today
[1:23:57] science has taken men further in the
[1:24:00] five senses
[1:24:01] more than ministers have taken the
[1:24:04] church into the soul
[1:24:07] scientists empowered men
[1:24:10] in this hour
[1:24:12] with knowing the thank you Pastor with
[1:24:15] knowing this the tree of Good and Evil
[1:24:17] [Music]
[1:24:19] Alexander Graham Bell
[1:24:21] invented the telephone
[1:24:24] are we together
[1:24:26] he took the materials
[1:24:28] and made a cell phone it was a log you
[1:24:31] know it was remember those days we used
[1:24:34] to have a directory
[1:24:36] and a big phone like this
[1:24:38] but look why how science had advanced
[1:24:42] now everything you find it in an iPhone
[1:24:45] the phone book the library everything so
[1:24:49] science is advancing
[1:24:52] are we together
[1:24:53] then Benjamin Franklin came
[1:24:57] there's those things we used to call the
[1:24:58] Flambeau where you put a string and then
[1:25:01] you light it up and the wind would blow
[1:25:04] it but still
[1:25:06] they were worried because a lot of
[1:25:08] people were lives were losing people
[1:25:10] were dying
[1:25:12] and one time he tied a kite and tied the
[1:25:15] spoon somewhere there and brah Brahm
[1:25:18] talks about this Benjamin Franklin
[1:25:20] and he said one time he put it in the
[1:25:23] air and the lightning struck and he saw
[1:25:25] the light he says I've got it I've got
[1:25:27] it I've got it
[1:25:29] but still he was not convinced
[1:25:33] and then he passed away without
[1:25:36] explaining all these things
[1:25:40] are we together
[1:25:42] are we together
[1:25:43] then Thomas Edison came
[1:25:46] are we together
[1:25:48] and he looked for the materials Benjamin
[1:25:51] Franklin was using
[1:25:53] and Barbara says he used to stay in a
[1:25:55] three-story building with wires powered
[1:25:58] from there and he tried nine to nine
[1:26:02] point nine whatever whatever until the
[1:26:03] light came
[1:26:05] are we together
[1:26:12] let me rush so we are living in a Time
[1:26:16] in the season
[1:26:18] before you travel before you go anywhere
[1:26:21] you have to study the times and seasons
[1:26:25] before you go to Florida or Texas you
[1:26:29] have to find like what season are we in
[1:26:31] is it winter is it cold
[1:26:33] you have to have the you have to
[1:26:35] research to have the knowledge to have
[1:26:37] the requirements of what you're going to
[1:26:39] put on
[1:26:40] but as message believers
[1:26:42] Hallelujah we have books and message
[1:26:44] books and tips which shows you where you
[1:26:47] are going what kind of a body you're
[1:26:50] going to have
[1:26:51] how we are going there what preparations
[1:26:54] have been made for you
[1:26:55] and we have all these materials
[1:26:59] we see Noah was manifesting what I call
[1:27:03] extraterrestrial intelligence
[1:27:06] when he was making those qubits and so
[1:27:09] forth
[1:27:10] because he made contact with
[1:27:13] extraterrestrial being
[1:27:14] Enoch the same brother pranam the same
[1:27:18] are we together
[1:27:20] let's talk about the mount
[1:27:21] Transfiguration conference
[1:27:24] Moses was born 1400 years before Christ
[1:27:28] and was born in Egypt and Pharaoh was
[1:27:31] king of Egypt
[1:27:32] and Elijah
[1:27:34] there you go was born 800 years before
[1:27:36] Christ and he lived in the time of Ahab
[1:27:39] and Jezebel
[1:27:40] are we together
[1:27:42] so we see Peter James and John edley
[1:27:44] Witnesses
[1:27:46] from this sex one body since Moses said
[1:27:49] Elijah in their theophonists
[1:27:52] Peter James and John they were in their
[1:27:55] terrestrial bodies
[1:27:56] then Jesus passed into glorification
[1:28:00] what was happening
[1:28:02] Jesus
[1:28:04] he was reassing the second coming of the
[1:28:08] Lord Jesus Christ
[1:28:09] what time are we living next light we
[1:28:12] are living in the four raptures
[1:28:14] we are living the first Rapture was
[1:28:16] Enoch the second one was Elijah
[1:28:19] the third Rapture next slide was Jesus
[1:28:23] who took the ultimate Testament Saints
[1:28:26] and the fourth one that's us
[1:28:28] I'm reminded when brother Branagh went
[1:28:30] to the sixth dimension
[1:28:33] he went and saw the Old Testament Saints
[1:28:36] and they said oh God bless you brother
[1:28:39] God bless you
[1:28:40] in this and to cut the long story short
[1:28:43] and brother Branham says can you take me
[1:28:45] to you Jesus
[1:28:47] and you know what they say we are
[1:28:49] waiting for you to present us to him
[1:28:52] says will Paul do the same say certainly
[1:28:55] will Peter do the same certainly
[1:29:01] make it mine will make it because I
[1:29:05] preached what Paul priest I preached
[1:29:08] what Peter priest
[1:29:10] and in the sense they correct with one
[1:29:12] voice and then it says on this we are
[1:29:15] resting
[1:29:16] we are resting upon the world we are
[1:29:19] resting upon the cause of Malachi 4.
[1:29:24] one time they examined him they put him
[1:29:27] on the machine
[1:29:28] everyone who has been put on a machine
[1:29:31] there's got lines that are closed like
[1:29:33] this but when they examined brother
[1:29:35] Branham they saw that on the machine he
[1:29:38] had lines that way far apart like this
[1:29:40] and they said according to this machine
[1:29:42] it means that you can walk and dream
[1:29:46] while you are awake
[1:29:48] he was not yeah yeah brother brother
[1:29:51] pranam
[1:29:53] was not just an ordinary man he was a
[1:29:56] man of God sent for this generation
[1:29:59] and there will never be any Elijah than
[1:30:02] Elijah Malachi four
[1:30:04] are we together
[1:30:07] can you put a picture of brother Branham
[1:30:09] with a pillow fire there you go in 1950
[1:30:14] he went to Houston Texas
[1:30:16] and Reverend best wanted to debate with
[1:30:19] him
[1:30:21] so they took pictures seven to be
[1:30:23] precise
[1:30:24] the first one was blank
[1:30:26] the second was blank
[1:30:28] the third the fourth was blank
[1:30:30] the sixth was blank but the 70 picture
[1:30:34] we are living in the days where people
[1:30:36] like to take selfies
[1:30:37] God came and took a selfie with his own
[1:30:40] prophet
[1:30:43] so the promises were made to Abraham and
[1:30:46] this seed any man baptized in Christ is
[1:30:50] Abraham's seed Abraham is the father of
[1:30:53] many nations I feel like preaching now
[1:30:56] Abraham is the father of them that
[1:30:58] believe so Abraham has got ham and
[1:31:02] pranam has got ham and seven letters
[1:31:05] which means he's a father of many
[1:31:06] nations
[1:31:08] that's why praname has got children in
[1:31:10] America Parliament children in Zimbabwe
[1:31:13] pranam as children in South Africa
[1:31:15] pranama's children in Congo pranam as
[1:31:18] children in New Zealand planning my
[1:31:20] children in Kenya he is the father of
[1:31:22] many nations God was showing him a
[1:31:25] vision when his children were marching
[1:31:27] Onward Christian Soldiers and he said
[1:31:30] stay in line stay in line
[1:31:33] and they reach to a certain place where
[1:31:35] they began to break the law of gravity
[1:31:37] and they were taken up in the heavens
[1:31:39] all those who rejected Prana Ministry
[1:31:41] they were going down into hell
[1:31:44] so we see the seven Messengers from poor
[1:31:47] to brother Branham they went to heaven
[1:31:49] by the way of the grave as Gladius Paul
[1:31:51] was as great as brother pranam was they
[1:31:54] went to heaven by the way of the grave
[1:31:56] but we who alive and remain until the
[1:31:59] coming of the lord we shall not all
[1:32:02] sleep but we shall be changed in a
[1:32:05] moment in a twinkling of an eye
[1:32:07] that's the promise
[1:32:11] [Music]
[1:32:13] next slide
[1:32:16] in the word heart
[1:32:19] there is an ear in the red heart
[1:32:22] days here in the word heart so when the
[1:32:26] word is being preached you have an ear
[1:32:28] to hear in your heart
[1:32:31] Hallelujah
[1:32:33] do you know that a Believer is more
[1:32:36] dangerous than an unbeliever
[1:32:38] the poor that the snake that he'd pour
[1:32:41] here Paul was more dangerous to the
[1:32:43] snake that hit him than the snake was
[1:32:45] dangerous to him when it hit him he just
[1:32:48] shook it in the fire and tonight there
[1:32:50] is fire here to check every situation
[1:32:54] David was more dangerous to Goliath than
[1:32:57] Goliath was dangerous to him
[1:32:59] Daniel was more dangerous to the Lions
[1:33:02] than the Lions was dangerous to him when
[1:33:05] he went to the Lion's Den the Bible says
[1:33:07] Daniel was fasting his fasting caused
[1:33:10] the Lions or affected the Lions when he
[1:33:14] went into the lion's den the Lions also
[1:33:16] went on fasting
[1:33:19] Joshua and Caleb were more dangerous to
[1:33:22] the Giants than Giants were dangerous to
[1:33:24] them
[1:33:26] was more dangerous to Haman than Haman
[1:33:30] was dangerous to him you are a danger to
[1:33:33] your dangers
[1:33:34] your sickness is in danger today
[1:33:37] because you are more powerful than an
[1:33:39] unbeliever
[1:33:40] [Applause]
[1:33:45] the rapture
[1:33:46] can I preach now
[1:33:48] the Rapture does not start with the body
[1:33:51] change it ends with a body change
[1:33:55] the Rapture is happening right now
[1:33:58] you already raptured
[1:34:02] Hallelujah
[1:34:03] Hallelujah
[1:34:05] he says behold listen the Rapture is not
[1:34:09] going to happen as a you know like

[1:34:13] the Rapture has happened no no no no no
[1:34:14] no no no no
[1:34:18] he says it's a secret
[1:34:21] behold I come as a thief at night how
[1:34:24] does a thief come
[1:34:26] when a thief comes to your house at 3am
[1:34:28] he has already come are we together when
[1:34:31] he jumps the gate and enters into the
[1:34:34] house he has already come
[1:34:36] when he sees an iPhone and puts it in
[1:34:38] the pocket he has already come
[1:34:41] when you wake up at 7 00 am and you find
[1:34:45] you the phone is gone
[1:34:48] the thief already came at 3am
[1:34:51] in 1963
[1:34:53] the thief came
[1:34:55] Hallelujah and he came doing what he was
[1:34:59] doing Hallelujah he was changing me
[1:35:02] Hallelujah and he was getting closer he
[1:35:06] was getting closer my theophany speaks
[1:35:10] to me
[1:35:11] Hallelujah
[1:35:12] Hallelujah
[1:35:14] by the time Charlotte wakes up
[1:35:17] Hallelujah the Hallelujah brother Caleb
[1:35:20] is no more Hallelujah by the time they
[1:35:24] opened their eyes my brother is no more
[1:35:26] brother Greg is no more brother Steve is
[1:35:29] no more why because the thief has
[1:35:32] already come
[1:35:34] [Applause]
[1:35:41] we are not waiting for the manifestation
[1:35:43] of the rapture
[1:35:44] the Rapture is not a one-day event
[1:35:47] the Rapture is a process you are
[1:35:50] raptured before you are raptured Enoch
[1:35:53] was raptured before he was raptured he
[1:35:55] was walking with God he was walking with
[1:35:58] God and he reached a higher Dimension
[1:36:00] I'm no longer operating from Charlotte
[1:36:02] I'm now operating from that third pool
[1:36:05] Realm
[1:36:07] I mean the word and the word is in me
[1:36:10] I'm in the Deadpool and the third pool
[1:36:13] is in me
[1:36:14] I'm in the Rapture because the Rapture
[1:36:17] is in me
[1:36:18] I'm in the spoken word because the
[1:36:20] spoken word is in me you're already
[1:36:22] raptured that's why you are rejoicing
[1:36:25] that's why you are saying amen but there
[1:36:28] is something in you that tells you that
[1:36:30] you are Rapture candidate there is
[1:36:33] something in you that tells you that you
[1:36:35] shall be changed before you are changed
[1:36:37] you start rejoicing why because there is
[1:36:41] a substance of what you are hoping for
[1:36:45] [Music]
[1:36:49] oh
[1:36:52] yes the Bible says at that day
[1:36:55] then problem says which is this day you
[1:36:59] shall know that I am in the father
[1:37:02] and the father is in me
[1:37:04] I don't have time I would have drawn
[1:37:06] here
[1:37:09] if I had a truck here because of time I
[1:37:13] was going to draw a big circle
[1:37:15] and I'll write God on it
[1:37:17] inside that big step I draw a smaller
[1:37:20] Circle
[1:37:21] then I'll write Christ on it inside
[1:37:23] that's why draw another smaller Circle
[1:37:26] and the right brother calebunion here
[1:37:30] so before the devil touches you he has
[1:37:33] to go through God he has to get to
[1:37:35] Christ before he touches you
[1:37:38] have to go through justification he has
[1:37:42] to go through sanctification before that

[1:48:59] if she comes here brother
[1:49:01] she will come here and she would do like
[1:49:03] this

[1:49:09] problems
[1:49:10] I say receive

[1:49:29] Praise Him praise him in the morning
[1:49:32] praise him in the afternoon Praise Him
[1:49:35] in the evening time when I get up I get
[1:49:37] up with a song get up with a shout
[1:49:40] praise where you are hallelujah thank
[1:49:44] you Jesus thank you Jesus
[1:49:47] thank you Jesus for Mount Sunset thank
[1:49:50] you Jesus for the message of the hour
[1:49:52] thank you Jesus Oh Hallelujah
[1:49:57] father we thank you of her we thank you
[1:50:00] Holy Spirit
[1:50:05] let's take our sins let's take our seats
[1:50:07] let's run this thing
[1:50:10] Hallelujah
[1:50:12] the Bible
[1:50:14] is the word of God
[1:50:16] but the message of the hour is the will
[1:50:18] of God
[1:50:21] let me repeat that
[1:50:22] the Bible
[1:50:24] is the word of God but the message of
[1:50:27] the hour is the will of God
[1:50:30] you can come to me remember in the time
[1:50:33] of Noah
[1:50:34] Noah started to build an ark it was the
[1:50:37] word of God to build an ark and the will
[1:50:39] of God in that day but if you come today
[1:50:42] when show me in the Bible is still the
[1:50:45] word of God but it's no longer the will
[1:50:47] of God
[1:50:48] you are privileged you are a chosen
[1:50:51] generation
[1:50:52] Hallelujah
[1:50:54] next quote my brother
[1:50:57] Christ is reviewed in his own word
[1:51:00] now when we're growing up
[1:51:02] we're told that heaven is a very far
[1:51:04] place
[1:51:05] then says now we are going to find out
[1:51:08] one of these days
[1:51:10] Hallelujah that when you go to heaven
[1:51:12] you don't fly off somewhere else
[1:51:15] he says you are still right here just in
[1:51:18] another dimension faster than this
[1:51:21] next quote
[1:51:23] 31 he says in God who is rich in Mercy
[1:51:26] and Redemption is two parts come out and
[1:51:28] entering into first you have to come out
[1:51:31] some people want to bring the world in
[1:51:33] with them but you've got to come out of
[1:51:36] this world and enter into Christ come
[1:51:38] out of unbelief and enter into Faith
[1:51:41] next next 24.
[1:51:44] now but he was telling them after the
[1:51:46] death there is a life because I go to
[1:51:49] prepare a place that is to receive them
[1:51:52] shows that there he was speaking to them
[1:51:56] and what a consolation that ought to
[1:51:59] give us to give to all of us to know
[1:52:03] that after this life is over there is a
[1:52:06] life that we are going to go into
[1:52:08] next slide he says your birth
[1:52:11] was here was pre-planned
[1:52:14] I guess you believe that
[1:52:16] Hallelujah
[1:52:18] every one of you that our bed was
[1:52:21] pre-planned
[1:52:23] did you know that being here was never
[1:52:26] originated as a myth or thought
[1:52:29] everything was all pre-planned by God
[1:52:32] before the foundation of the world
[1:52:35] that you will be here
[1:52:37] next slide and if we are Christians I
[1:52:41] think we ought to be kindly notified
[1:52:42] ahead we don't have to just have to
[1:52:44] guess at it we are notified of our
[1:52:46] destination will be
[1:52:49] now Jesus is speaking about he's going
[1:52:51] ahead to prepare a place for us see what
[1:52:53] I mean all you little children do you
[1:52:56] feel the need of that vitamin tonight
[1:52:59] there is a body waiting Yonder
[1:53:02] there's a body waiting to be received he
[1:53:06] said people don't be deceived the Devil
[1:53:09] is a deceiver even that wedding comment
[1:53:11] you must wear it
[1:53:13] it must be
[1:53:16] he says now we are here at the evening
[1:53:17] time and the Earthly body is now ready
[1:53:20] to be dissolved and we are preparing to
[1:53:22] enter into the Heavenly and we now feel
[1:53:25] that strange call
[1:53:28] of God can't you hear my brother your
[1:53:31] theophany calling it's a sign that is
[1:53:34] homegoing time
[1:53:36] the pillar on fire
[1:53:38] went behind human skin and revealed
[1:53:42] these seven sins
[1:53:44] Abraham at one point didn't know that
[1:53:47] there is a life after this life is ended
[1:53:50] and he was like who is this man who is
[1:53:53] not beginning and no ending of life
[1:53:56] and Moses
[1:53:58] could and this man could tell Moses to
[1:54:01] say I am that I am
[1:54:04] where did this man come from
[1:54:06] that talks to Moses and met Moses
[1:54:10] because with a connection with this man
[1:54:13] he could create
[1:54:15] who is this man that Moses met who says
[1:54:18] I am that I am
[1:54:20] in the same Pillar of Fire that met
[1:54:22] Moses
[1:54:24] Paul met the same Pillar of Fire and
[1:54:27] because Paul says Moses bore the
[1:54:30] reproach of Christ and barbraham says
[1:54:32] where did Moses meet Christ
[1:54:35] in brobraham says Christ was an angel
[1:54:38] give me that next quote
[1:54:40] God
[1:54:43] in
[1:54:45] God was in the form before he came flesh
[1:54:47] can you give me that verse in the Bible
[1:54:48] in Acts yeah
[1:54:50] so this man Paul says the angel of the
[1:54:53] Lord who's I am and whom I serve look at
[1:54:57] this scripture for they stood by me at
[1:55:00] night an angel of God whose I am
[1:55:04] and who myself
[1:55:06] was he saving an angel who was this
[1:55:09] angel
[1:55:11] can I preach to people who are spiritual
[1:55:13] here
[1:55:15] do you think this is a created angel
[1:55:17] that's the Creator
[1:55:19] and immerses in connection with this one
[1:55:23] he created William Branham in connection
[1:55:26] with this Angel he created
[1:55:29] Abraham saw the spoken word created
[1:55:33] realm in connection with this man
[1:55:36] Apostle the angel of the Lord whose I am
[1:55:39] in whom I serve is he saving an angel a
[1:55:43] whole Prophet messenger that is Jehovah
[1:55:46] angel
[1:55:47] and brother Brahm says the same one who
[1:55:49] came to Moses came to Paul and he came
[1:55:52] to me
[1:55:53] so Abraham met Melchizedek
[1:55:57] Melchizedek met El Shaddai
[1:56:00] and the same Elohim came into the body
[1:56:02] of Flesh
[1:56:03] and he met Jehovah Jireh who created a
[1:56:07] lamp
[1:56:08] was it four different people
[1:56:10] it was the same person
[1:56:12] brother pranam says how do I know he's
[1:56:14] the same person he says he does the same
[1:56:17] things
[1:56:18] so he preached who is this Melchizedek
[1:56:22] he preached El Shaddai he preached
[1:56:25] Elohim the son of the son of man in
[1:56:28] human flesh and he preached Jehovah
[1:56:30] Jireh
[1:56:31] yet the same experience with this man he
[1:56:35] changes his form but not his nature
[1:56:38] Hallelujah and he and this one
[1:56:41] encompassed these who have angels in
[1:56:44] heaven
[1:56:45] because he is the king of heavenly
[1:56:47] Jerusalem
[1:56:48] and in that City John saw the bride it
[1:56:53] was the Lamb's wife it was a pyramid
[1:56:55] City
[1:56:56] Jesus said in my father's name in my
[1:56:59] father's house are many mansions
[1:57:02] John saw many mansions in the code ate a
[1:57:06] city
[1:57:07] and that city is the Lamb's wife
[1:57:10] and the Lamb's wife is the names in the
[1:57:14] lamps section of the book
[1:57:16] and the names in the lamp section of the
[1:57:18] book is the Eternal attributes
[1:57:21] that come from his loins
[1:57:24] a royal priesthood
[1:57:27] we are redeemed as Kings and Priests
[1:57:30] and the marriage supper is the true
[1:57:33] communion
[1:57:36] says when I went on the other side I saw
[1:57:39] many of you in millions
[1:57:42] and all those with angels there they've
[1:57:45] got terrestrial bodies in it
[1:57:47] says I saw many of you
[1:57:50] and all those in theophan is they have
[1:57:53] terrestrial bodies here when Paradise is
[1:57:55] emptied out
[1:57:57] they will come and pick back up
[1:57:59] and now this board is getting ready to
[1:58:02] be dissolved
[1:58:04] this body is fixing to be changed
[1:58:07] and you feel that strange call we are
[1:58:11] hearing from our to your family
[1:58:14] in closing when winter is coming
[1:58:17] there is an intelligence
[1:58:19] that goes into the sap of the tree and
[1:58:22] goes into the root
[1:58:25] and it hides there until winter is done
[1:58:29] are we together
[1:58:31] what about the Drake
[1:58:33] he goes into the ocean four thousand
[1:58:36] miles deep
[1:58:37] there is a law of navigation in him
[1:58:40] are we together when that season comes
[1:58:43] he goes back to the same place of its
[1:58:46] origin
[1:58:48] Solomon says consider the ways of an end
[1:58:51] he knows winter is coming so in summer
[1:58:54] is gathering all the food
[1:58:56] when the season comes he has stored food
[1:58:59] through God through the winter
[1:59:02] animals are being contacted
[1:59:05] from another world
[1:59:08] they understand the season
[1:59:11] even the ducks in the pond
[1:59:14] they navigate with the stars and the
[1:59:17] moon and they fly very thousands of
[1:59:20] miles
[1:59:22] perfect GPS
[1:59:25] and what about the cows and the birds
[1:59:27] when the earthquake is about to happen
[1:59:30] are we together
[1:59:31] they say they they're being contacted
[1:59:35] from another world and brother Brahm
[1:59:38] says if birds and animals and all these
[1:59:40] things could be directed and led by God
[1:59:43] about a season what about a church
[1:59:46] claiming to have the Holy Ghost
[1:59:49] we feel that we feel that strange call
[1:59:52] Hallelujah
[1:59:54] you are in the message 20 years 30 years

[2:00:01] religion it's leading us to God's
[2:00:04] provided way
[2:00:05] and the gene of God is inside of you
[2:00:08] this curtain of time this body
[2:00:11] it veils the gene of God inside of you
[2:00:15] what is the message
[2:00:17] it's opening up our pre-existence
[2:00:21] teaching us our athlete Journey
[2:00:24] and showing us our Eternal destination
[2:00:28] Redemption is bringing us back to your
[2:00:32] origin
[2:00:33] there is no concept of the Rapture
[2:00:35] without these things
[2:00:37] there is no religion no Hinduism no
[2:00:40] Buddhism shows you where you were before

[2:07:42] when some are spending their night can't
[2:07:45] even get asleep

[2:10:13] our strength
[2:10:15] that's where we can change our situation

[2:10:21] fight the battle and to stand
[2:10:24] father may we move away from a life of
[2:10:28] competition
