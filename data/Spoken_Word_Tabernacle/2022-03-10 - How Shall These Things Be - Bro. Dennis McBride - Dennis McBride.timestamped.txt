[38:54] and what is on tv it's totally east and
[38:58] west
[38:59] and probably you won't like it
[39:01] amen
[39:03] but it's just prophecy
[39:05] and it's keep vindicating that we got a
[39:08] true
[39:09] prophet of god
[39:11] amen
[39:12] everything is going straight to line
[39:15] and i can understand why the holy spirit
[39:17] is insisting on the holiest now so that
[39:21] everybody can self-examine their life
[39:24] and make sure you got the token
[39:28] to make it clear to go in the rapture
[39:32] you must have the holy ghost
[39:35] did you get it
[39:37] amen to make it to heaven down the road
[39:40] that's a different story but to go in
[39:42] the rapture and to escape whatever have
[39:44] started right now you must have the holy
[39:48] ghost
[39:49] amen
[39:50] so forget about your 20 years in the
[39:52] message you're 30 years in the message
[39:54] you're 40 years in a message forget
[39:56] about all of that
[39:57] amen
[39:58] examine yourself by the word we describe
[40:01] to you the other court we describe
[40:03] justification on sunday we explain it in
[40:06] much detail and the lord willing i'm
[40:09] gonna go through the scripture on sunday
[40:11] and show you every single step one two
[40:14] three one two three in the scripture one
[40:16] two three and it doesn't fail
[40:18] all of them one two three one two three
[40:20] one two three all of them you must
[40:22] repent and be baptized and receive the
[40:24] holy ghost all of them back to 38 amen

[40:38] been wrong

[40:44] oh my god
[40:46] amen
[40:47] if i'm preaching you three sermons
[40:50] behind something is wrong
[40:52] you are not in the holiest
[40:57] did you get me
[40:58] if they preach four sermons here and you
[41:00] are behind those sermons four of them on
[41:03] the road something is wrong with your
[41:05] work
[41:07] in this time amen
[41:09] i have a hard time sleeping last night
[41:12] because of what the boss was unfolding
[41:15] and you will see
[41:16] how lutheran are in this message
[41:21] and you're gonna see how westlay people
[41:23] are in this message
[41:25] and you will see pentecostal in this
[41:27] message
[41:28] amen
[41:29] the lord unfolded the roof under
[41:31] calvinism and i seen it going and i see
[41:34] the roof under armenianism
[41:37] right there going through that line and
[41:38] it's very very shocking and your
[41:41] marriages goes through the tabernacle
[41:44] and lord's willing you will see where
[41:46] your marriage is whether your marriage
[41:48] is in the other court
[41:51] or your marriage is in the holy place or
[41:53] your marriage is in the holiest place
[41:55] there is a way you behave in your
[41:57] marriage that is telling you your
[41:59] marriage is not where he's supposed to
[42:01] be and the problem is over the years
[42:04] this has been built so long
[42:07] until it's hard to break it
[42:10] do you know what i'm talking about
[42:12] you don't get me probably
[42:15] oh my
[42:17] what i'm trying to say is
[42:22] oh lord have mercy
[42:24] if you start your marriage in the other
[42:29] call the court sooner
[42:35] because you got quiet on me so i gotta
[42:37] say something
[42:39] amen
[42:40] if you started your
[42:42] marriage in the outer court
[42:46] and your children are not born yet
[42:51] it's a little bit different
[42:53] when your children are born and you have
[42:55] not moved from the other court
[42:59] do you hear me
[43:01] your children are watching you
[43:05] they are watching your marriage
[43:08] in the other court
[43:10] and if those children
[43:12] reach 15 years
[43:14] or 18 years
[43:18] before you realize
[43:20] that your marriage was in the other
[43:22] court
[43:23] and you start fixing your marriage after
[43:26] 18 years
[43:28] you have loaded your children with 18
[43:31] years
[43:32] of other court in your life
[43:34] you are changing everything is good
[43:37] praise god
[43:38] but your children are going to suffer
[43:41] through their christianity because of
[43:43] what they have been watching at home for
[43:45] 15 years
[43:49] do you understand what i'm saying and
[43:51] now these 14 years here now it's the
[43:54] pastor suffering
[43:57] to fix this up
[44:00] amen and you hear me
[44:02] insisting for the newly
[44:05] married couple
[44:07] to make sure they can correct things
[44:09] quickly
[44:11] sometimes we don't get it sometimes
[44:13] they're the people that have a hard time
[44:14] being in churches
[44:16] amen
[44:17] sometimes they are the people that are
[44:19] behind because they do not understand
[44:22] that if your marriage was in a holy
[44:25] place for 20 years
[44:29] the children has been under trauma
[44:35] you won't understand what i'm saying
[44:38] if you live like a lutheran
[44:42] in this message or if you live like a
[44:44] wasteland
[44:46] in this message
[44:47] the children has been traumatized for so
[44:50] long
[44:51] they have seen so much at home that
[44:54] doesn't look like the message of brother
[44:56] branham
[44:57] until they're tired of the message
[45:00] and there is no desire for them to the
[45:03] message it takes amazing grace for god
[45:06] to drop through and then pick it up
[45:08] and show that child that you cannot be
[45:10] blaming your parent you need to take
[45:12] your own decision and move on
[45:15] amen
[45:16] and there and the and the
[45:18] and the pitiful way is we are struggling
[45:20] and i'm hitting a rock sometime trying
[45:23] to get the people to wake up
[45:25] and the parents are still playing games
[45:28] while the younger are picking up
[45:31] [Music]
[45:32] and what condoned their hearts what
[45:35] calmed their heart they've been in the
[45:37] message for 25 years they heard this one
[45:39] preach we preached the church ages with
[45:41] the church ages you look at the
[45:43] situation you are look at the situation
[45:45] your family is with all the knowledge
[45:47] that you have all these years
[45:54] may lord have mercy
[45:57] amen
[45:58] may god have mercy may the parent wake
[46:01] up
[46:02] i hate when they say you need to teach
[46:04] those kids where were you doing
[46:06] you need to teach the kids no i need to
[46:08] start from you
[46:10] before i can get to the family because
[46:12] you're the one that missed someone
[46:16] and the children are victims
[46:18] of going through a rough
[46:20] childhood
[46:21] because the parent was not in the
[46:23] holiest
[46:25] but they grew up in a message
[46:28] amen
[46:29] and they thought they have the holy
[46:31] ghost
[46:32] and they give everybody the holy ghost
[46:34] as long as they can quote the prophet
[46:37] they can discuss the prophet they can
[46:40] argue the prophet online on social media
[46:43] they thought they got the holy ghost and
[46:45] living like devils
[46:48] amen
[46:50] it's self-examining time what is going
[46:52] on in russia is not a game
[46:55] if i get in prophecy and pull what is
[46:58] going on in russia you'll be scared
[47:02] amen
[47:04] so examine yourself
[47:06] make sure if you're in the other court
[47:08] move down quickly move quickly amen
[47:12] if you brother branham say on sunday i
[47:14] read the quote that do not wait for the
[47:16] death bed
[47:17] because that opportunity might not be
[47:19] your opportunity to give your life to
[47:21] christ and straight to go to heaven amen
[47:23] but if you have been in the message 15
[47:26] years 18 years and you never move from
[47:29] the other court something is wrong with
[47:32] your beginning you need to go back to
[47:34] the brazen altar again you gotta make
[47:37] contact with the living christ
[47:40] the living god
[47:42] and this message will not be a burden
[47:44] for you
[47:46] and when they say let's go to church
[47:47] you'll be ready to go to church
[47:54] don't worry my friend wait on sunday if
[47:56] you think this is good
[47:59] this is hard
[48:00] wait and the lord will help us amen so
[48:03] make sure you continue to consecrate
[48:05] yourself if you find yourself where you
[48:07] are

[51:36] lord
[51:39] i received
[51:43] all
[51:44] things
[51:47] [Music]
[51:56] amen let us just bow our hearts and our
[51:58] heads before the lord
[52:02] and as we're bowing let us realize that
[52:04] we're bowing before a living god
[52:08] and he's mindful of each one of us right
[52:11] now
[52:14] he understands all of our issues
[52:17] all of our problems
[52:21] and he's able to do something about it
[52:25] we just don't sing that song just to
[52:27] sing it
[52:29] it's more than just a good melody
[52:32] but it's a reality
[52:36] and god is making it more and more real
[52:38] to us
[52:40] he's taken us from a world of unbelief
[52:43] and he's brought us into his world he's
[52:46] drawn us closer to himself
[52:49] he's enabled us to be able to look at
[52:51] him now and hear his word
[52:53] and be able to agree with it
[52:56] and accept it
[52:58] heavenly father we don't want to prolong
[53:00] the time lord because we realize that
[53:03] speaking many words in prayer doesn't
[53:06] impress you
[53:09] but god you know our hearts you know all
[53:11] about us
[53:12] you know where we're at you know what we
[53:14] need
[53:16] forgive us lord of our sins and
[53:18] iniquities heavenly father
[53:21] lord we ask that you would please just
[53:22] have your way
[53:25] you know what we need lord more than
[53:28] ourselves
[53:29] sometimes we're too a little too
[53:31] confident fathering ourselves
[53:34] the natural types the spiritual lord
[53:36] many times as children are coming up in
[53:38] the world and they go through their
[53:40] different stages and enter into teenage
[53:42] and adulthood
[53:44] they account themselves to knowing more
[53:46] than what they should
[53:49] but lord you say that unless we come to
[53:51] you as a child
[53:54] meaning we don't come as though we know
[53:56] we come as though we don't nothing
[53:59] because even in what we think we know
[54:01] there is so much more to it
[54:04] there's so
[54:05] the depth there's more depths to it
[54:07] father it's more content
[54:11] so father from my heart you know that i
[54:13] don't feel like i know anything
[54:15] you've brought me to that place lord and
[54:17] i'm not the only one i know many of us
[54:19] if not all of us in here
[54:21] we've reached that place father by your
[54:24] grace
[54:25] so lord we pray that you would just help
[54:27] us now we've come from different places
[54:29] lord different activities
[54:31] different jobs things of that nature
[54:33] father god so we just pray that you will
[54:35] settle us in our
[54:36] spirits and help us tonight to speak and
[54:39] to hear
[54:41] let it all be you for your glory and for
[54:43] your honor
[54:45] we ask this father in your name the name
[54:47] of our lord and savior jesus christ
[54:50] let the church say amen
[54:54] praise the lord
[54:58] so the lord saw fit for
[55:00] us to be here tonight
[55:03] amen i i knew you didn't have a chance
[55:06] to know because brother stephen called
[55:07] me sunday evening
[55:10] right
[55:11] and so uh
[55:13] but nonetheless it's good to be here
[55:16] of course i don't know everybody by name
[55:18] but for those that i do know god bless
[55:20] you and for those that i don't know god
[55:22] bless you as well
[55:24] amen so let's get right into the word
[55:26] because i know it's a weekday
[55:28] and we have to go to work and things in
[55:30] the morning
[55:32] we don't want to make that a priority
[55:34] over god but at the same time just
[55:36] within myself
[55:37] you know i just want to be sensitive to
[55:39] that so let's go to luke chapter one
[55:48] god for
[55:49] a few of the saints that came up from
[55:51] columbia
[55:56] you know a little surprised there i
[55:58] didn't know they were going to actually
[55:59] make it but
[56:01] they're here by the grace of god
[56:05] amen
[56:07] we want to start at verse 5 it says
[56:09] there was in the days of herod the king
[56:11] of judah a certain priest notice he was
[56:14] a priest
[56:15] named zacharias of the course of abia
[56:18] and his wife was of the daughters of
[56:20] aaron and her name was elizabeth
[56:23] and they were both righteous before god
[56:25] walking in all the commandments and
[56:27] ordinances of the lord blameless
[56:29] it says and they had no child because
[56:31] that elizabeth was what
[56:34] she was barren and it says and they both
[56:36] were now well stricken in years
[56:38] and it came to pass that while he he
[56:40] executed the priest's office so that
[56:43] means he understood the scriptures
[56:46] right
[56:47] he was very familiar with a lot of
[56:48] scriptures god had led him to deal with
[56:51] i'm sure many things over the years
[56:54] so the part that we're going to
[56:55] emphasize here is is kind of a little
[56:58] surprising there but nonetheless
[57:00] let's move forward it says and and his
[57:02] lot was to burn incense when he went
[57:04] into the temple of the lord and the
[57:06] whole multitude of the people were
[57:08] praying without at the time of incense
[57:10] and there appeared unto him an angel of
[57:12] the lord standing on the right side of
[57:14] the altar of incense and when zechariah
[57:17] saw him he was troubled and fear fell on
[57:20] him it says but the angel said unto him
[57:22] fear not zacharias for thy prayer is
[57:24] heard so it was something he was praying
[57:27] about
[57:28] how many have things that you're praying
[57:30] about
[57:32] praise the lord
[57:34] amen she says thy prayers were heard
[57:37] it says and thy wife elizabeth shall
[57:40] bear thee a son and thou shalt call his
[57:42] name john
[57:44] and thou shalt have joy and gladness and
[57:46] many shall rejoice at his birth it says
[57:49] for he shall be great in the sight of
[57:51] the lord and shall drink neither wine
[57:53] nor a strong drink and he shall be
[57:56] filled with the holy ghost even from his
[57:58] mother's womb
[57:59] and many of the children of israel shall
[58:01] he turn to the lord their god and he
[58:04] shall go before him in the spirit and
[58:06] power of elias to turn the hearts of the
[58:08] fathers to the children and the
[58:09] disobedient to the wisdom of the just to
[58:12] make ready to make ready a people
[58:14] prepared for the lord and zechariah said
[58:17] unto the angel
[58:18] this is a very critical part and this is
[58:20] what we're going to be dealing with
[58:23] so he knew he was an angel
[58:26] and he just was told what it was that he
[58:29] prayed for
[58:30] right
[58:33] but notice how he responded here and
[58:34] zechariah said unto the angel whereby
[58:37] shall i know this
[58:39] for i am an old man and my wife well
[58:42] stricken in years
[58:44] that doesn't sound that bad does it
[58:47] but the way that god heard it god was
[58:50] offended
[58:53] you see people can speak a lot of words
[58:55] right but there is a source behind those
[58:57] words
[58:58] there's a spirit that's behind those
[59:00] words
[59:01] so obviously in what zechariah said
[59:05] there was a doubting tone
[59:09] it was more of an unbelief that he was
[59:11] speaking from
[59:13] you understand what i'm saying
[59:18] now even though we're we're speaking
[59:20] about this in light of the scripture
[59:23] please understand that it's things that
[59:25] you and i deal with
[59:27] things that we pray for
[59:29] things you're praying for right now
[59:34] but see god he listens to more than just
[59:36] our words
[59:38] there's little spiritual tones
[59:46] and zechariah said unto the angel
[59:47] whereby shall i know this for i am an
[59:49] old man and my wife will stricken in
[59:51] years and the angel answering said unto
[59:53] him i am gabriel that stand in the
[59:56] presence of god and am sent to speak
[59:58] unto thee to show thee these glad
[1:00:00] tidings and behold thou shalt be dumb
[1:00:05] and not able to speak until the day that
[1:00:07] these things shall be performed because
[1:00:09] thou believers not my words which shall
[1:00:12] be fulfilled in their season
[1:00:15] so even though he had a little doubt in
[1:00:17] his heart concerning what was being
[1:00:19] spoken
[1:00:21] also understand his doubt didn't hinder
[1:00:23] the promise of god
[1:00:28] we're not always believing like we
[1:00:29] should isn't that right
[1:00:31] amen but how many know that our unbelief
[1:00:34] our little doubts and things it ain't
[1:00:35] going to hinder what god has promised
[1:00:38] for us according to his word
[1:00:41] because he said himself my word has gone
[1:00:43] out and it shall not come back to me boy
[1:00:47] he said but it shall accomplish what he
[1:00:49] sent it out to do and it shall prosper
[1:00:51] within the thing where until he sent it
[1:00:56] we say praise the lord
[1:00:57] [Music]
[1:00:58] let's bow once more heavenly father
[1:01:00] we thank you lord help us we pray in
[1:01:03] jesus christ's name we ask you amen
[1:01:16] praise the lord
[1:01:20] okay so before we really get into this
[1:01:23] let's go also to
[1:01:25] see this is luke chapter one still
[1:01:27] right and let's just drop down to verse
[1:01:29] 26.
[1:01:32] verse 26 says and this and in the sixth
[1:01:34] month the angel gabriel was sent for
[1:01:36] this was sent from god unto a city that
[1:01:39] same angel
[1:01:43] he just went to zacharias
[1:01:46] so now he's coming and he's doing
[1:01:47] another visit
[1:01:50] right and it says um named nazareth he
[1:01:54] says to aversion espoused to a man whose
[1:01:57] name was joseph and the house of david
[1:01:59] it says in the virgin's name was mary
[1:02:02] it says and the angel came in unto her
[1:02:04] and said hell thou art thou says that
[1:02:07] thou that are highly favored and the
[1:02:10] lord is with thee he says blessed are
[1:02:12] thou among women and when she saw him
[1:02:15] she was troubled at his at his saying
[1:02:18] and cast her mind notice how it says
[1:02:20] this and cast her mind what manner of
[1:02:22] salutation this should be and the angel
[1:02:25] said unto her fear not mary for thou
[1:02:28] thou hast found favor with god and
[1:02:30] behold thou shalt conceive in thy womb
[1:02:32] and bring forth a son and shall call his
[1:02:35] name jesus he says he shall be great and
[1:02:38] shall be called the son of the highest
[1:02:40] and the lord and the lord god shall give
[1:02:43] unto him the throne of his father david
[1:02:46] and he shall reign over the house of
[1:02:47] jacob forever and of his kingdom there
[1:02:50] shall be no end it says then said mary
[1:02:53] unto the angel notice this now
[1:02:56] she said the exact same thing
[1:03:07] but even though she said the same thing
[1:03:08] it was coming from a different place
[1:03:12] her
[1:03:13] her asking the question that she did
[1:03:16] it was more connected to just an
[1:03:18] overwhelming feeling
[1:03:20] she was overwhelmed right because here
[1:03:23] it is she's a virgin but she's being
[1:03:25] told she's going to have a child
[1:03:28] you know i said she didn't disbelieve
[1:03:29] what was said
[1:03:31] obviously because god is god right
[1:03:34] if she was disbelieving she would have
[1:03:36] been treated just like zechariah but she
[1:03:38] wasn't ordained to respond like that
[1:03:44] so even though she said the exact same
[1:03:46] words god heard what she said
[1:03:48] differently
[1:03:52] because notice what it goes on to say
[1:03:56] how shall this be seeing i know not a
[1:03:58] man and the angel answered and said unto
[1:04:01] her the holy ghost shall come upon me
[1:04:04] and the power of the highest shall
[1:04:06] overshadow thee therefore also that holy
[1:04:08] thing which shall be born of thee shall
[1:04:11] be called the son of god
[1:04:14] and behold thy cousin elizabeth she she
[1:04:17] have also conceived a son in her old age
[1:04:20] and this is the sixth month with her he
[1:04:22] says who who was called barren it says
[1:04:25] for with god nothing shall be what
[1:04:28] impossible do you believe that tonight
[1:04:30] [Music]
[1:04:32] so just considering again your prayers
[1:04:34] your situations the things you're
[1:04:36] dealing with right now
[1:04:37] [Music]
[1:04:38] is there anything too hard for god
[1:04:41] no not a thing isn't that right
[1:04:43] i'm preaching to myself
[1:04:46] amen because we get into those places
[1:04:48] saints
[1:04:49] we get into those places where our minds
[1:04:51] get bound up
[1:04:53] listen one thing the lord was helping me
[1:04:55] to see in my own heart he said satan
[1:04:57] always desired to make the problem a
[1:05:00] rather i'm sorry yeah he wants to make
[1:05:02] the problem look bigger than the promise
[1:05:07] you get so caught up into everything
[1:05:09] that you're going through isn't that
[1:05:10] right
[1:05:11] until you begin to look at the situation
[1:05:13] over and over and over again and you
[1:05:15] spend very little time looking at the
[1:05:17] promise
[1:05:18] [Music]
[1:05:20] when the victory is in the promise
[1:05:24] looking at the word focusing in on the
[1:05:26] word stand focus
[1:05:29] but satan wants us to focus in on our
[1:05:31] problems
[1:05:32] he wants us to focus in on everything
[1:05:34] that's not going that's not going right
[1:05:40] but notice this now
[1:05:43] in verse 38 and mary said behold the
[1:05:45] handmaid of the lord
[1:05:47] he says be it unto me according to thy
[1:05:50] word
[1:05:51] and the angel departed from her
[1:05:54] so then then it comes down and elizabeth
[1:05:56] now she begins to rejoice and she gets
[1:05:58] caught up in the spirit of god
[1:06:01] and here in verse 45 it says and blessed
[1:06:04] is she that believe notice this now it
[1:06:07] says for there shall be a performance
[1:06:11] of those things which were told her of
[1:06:14] the lord
[1:06:17] so when we are able to believe god and i
[1:06:19] want to show you how much grace is tied
[1:06:21] into this because you can't even believe
[1:06:23] god on your own
[1:06:25] it's not about how hard you can focus in
[1:06:27] on the word and repeat the word over and
[1:06:30] over and over again no sir god has to
[1:06:32] come down and anoint our faith
[1:06:35] and when god anoints our faith then
[1:06:37] we're able to look and stay focused on
[1:06:39] that promise it becomes a reality
[1:06:50] [Music]
[1:06:55] watch this
[1:06:56] let me just now for my title before i
[1:06:59] get caught up too much here
[1:07:02] how shall these things be
[1:07:07] how shall these things be that's a
[1:07:09] question
[1:07:10] that's a question that circulates quite
[1:07:12] often
[1:07:15] especially when we look at ourselves
[1:07:19] just like brother stephen was saying
[1:07:20] prophecy is being fulfilled all over the
[1:07:23] place
[1:07:24] and we hear the manner of word that god
[1:07:26] is ministering to our hearts
[1:07:29] and the devil the devil has a desire
[1:07:33] there is a way that he wants you to view
[1:07:34] yourself
[1:07:36] now god wants us to see where we are
[1:07:38] right
[1:07:40] right
[1:07:41] but god also wants us to know that we
[1:07:43] can't help ourselves
[1:07:46] it don't matter how messed up you view
[1:07:48] yourself as being i mean it might be
[1:07:50] real
[1:07:52] i mean we are messed up right
[1:08:06] i'm a work in progress
[1:08:09] you understand i'm saying i ain't got
[1:08:10] everything all together like that
[1:08:12] amen but you know what god is saying
[1:08:14] okay but you can't look at everything
[1:08:16] that's not together
[1:08:18] that's not how change is gonna come
[1:08:22] how does change come saints when we have
[1:08:24] faith in a living god according to his
[1:08:27] word
[1:08:28] regardless of what we see
[1:08:32] the bible says we walk by faith and not
[1:08:35] by sight
[1:08:40] isn't that right
[1:08:42] but now we're saying amen to that
[1:08:46] but how many of us so often succumb
[1:08:50] i said i'm preaching to myself
[1:08:54] i don't know about you but i'm having
[1:08:56] the hardest battles that i've ever had
[1:08:58] in my entire life
[1:09:02] amen it's a real battle isn't that right
[1:09:05] from the time you wake up to the time
[1:09:06] you lay down
[1:09:08] it never stops it's the greatest battle
[1:09:10] that was ever fought it's in the mind
[1:09:14] satan always trying to find a way to get
[1:09:17] ahold of our mind listen now and lock it
[1:09:20] into a channel
[1:09:23] amen listen now that that god can't even
[1:09:26] move upon because it creates an
[1:09:28] atmosphere
[1:09:30] how we allow ourselves to think saints
[1:09:32] it creates an atmosphere
[1:09:34] right around us
[1:09:36] now my question is now let's be honest
[1:09:39] with ourselves what kind of an
[1:09:40] atmosphere do you believe you have based
[1:09:43] off of the circulating thoughts that
[1:09:44] you've allowed to prevail
[1:09:47] in your home i'm talking about right now
[1:09:49] everybody being honest with themselves
[1:09:54] you understand the but it's impossible
[1:09:56] to please god without what
[1:10:03] the bible said we come boldly before the
[1:10:05] throne of
[1:10:07] why because of the blood it's the way
[1:10:09] that god made for us
[1:10:13] he knew how messed up we would be he
[1:10:15] knew how many mistakes we would make he
[1:10:17] knew how much forgiveness we would need
[1:10:19] changed
[1:10:20] and he made the ultimate way that's not
[1:10:23] lacking nothing
[1:10:24] [Music]
[1:10:25] that's an all-sufficient glory that was
[1:10:27] shared isn't that right
[1:10:30] you know what
[1:10:31] we're already forgiven
[1:10:33] [Music]
[1:10:34] you forgetting for things you ain't even
[1:10:36] did yet
[1:10:46] is that just me
[1:10:49] or did he say did christ say out of his
[1:10:51] own lips
[1:10:52] he said it is
[1:10:54] finished
[1:11:01] [Music]
[1:11:06] this is the first time i've ever
[1:11:07] ministered on this
[1:11:09] when he asked me to come
[1:11:11] just some things that started coming to
[1:11:13] me and
[1:11:14] it's just settled on my heart
[1:11:17] but the way that we allow ourselves to
[1:11:19] think
[1:11:22] is very important
[1:11:25] we're human
[1:11:27] we all have our ups and downs
[1:11:30] it's a part of life
[1:11:32] but god is here to give us more ups and
[1:11:34] downs
[1:11:36] he's here to change the tide
[1:11:39] isn't that right he's here to give us
[1:11:40] more victory
[1:11:42] notice this now
[1:11:45] i'mma try to i'm gonna try to keep this
[1:11:46] real tight
[1:11:50] listen this message here is called
[1:11:52] mary's belief i've been in that message
[1:11:54] for a few days now
[1:11:56] all the way up here
[1:11:59] i got a suggestion also brother stephen
[1:12:01] you might be able to make to the
[1:12:02] governor or the mayor whoever
[1:12:05] and they can kind of broaden those
[1:12:06] streets y'all got the interstate about
[1:12:08] 20 lanes
[1:12:14] all right lord have mercy i'm glad i
[1:12:16] left home early
[1:12:18] had a total stand still
[1:12:20] i thought i was back in cincinnati
[1:12:25] i know i caught you all off guard with
[1:12:27] that
[1:12:30] i was like man
[1:12:32] praise the lord we're here
[1:12:35] all right so now this is called mary's
[1:12:37] beliefs the reason why i mention that is
[1:12:39] because i listen to that message on the
[1:12:41] way up here
[1:12:43] all right he says here he says in the
[1:12:45] preacher questioned the angel
[1:12:50] one thing that stood out to me about
[1:12:51] brother brown and when he was talking
[1:12:52] about zacharias
[1:12:54] he says also something that bothered god
[1:12:56] was the fact that zacharias had examples
[1:13:00] of people that were in the same
[1:13:02] situation as himself
[1:13:05] and with him being a priest he already
[1:13:07] knew what the scroll said
[1:13:11] abraham
[1:13:15] stricken in years wife wife wound dead
[1:13:24] you understand what i'm saying so when
[1:13:25] god heard zachariah's words he was like
[1:13:28] nah i know i know i know i know he ain't
[1:13:31] just say that
[1:13:33] did you just sign that you just say what
[1:13:35] i told you
[1:13:37] you ain't mean to say that you ain't in
[1:13:39] your right mind
[1:13:42] but you saw what god did god made him
[1:13:44] dumb
[1:13:46] so he couldn't listen so he couldn't so
[1:13:48] he couldn't taint the beliefs of anybody
[1:13:51] else
[1:13:52] with the unbelieving spirit that was
[1:13:54] upon him
[1:13:56] you understand you know god will do us
[1:13:58] the same way we get to talking too
[1:14:01] negative and things of that nature god
[1:14:02] will shut your mouth up
[1:14:07] because god don't want to hear that
[1:14:10] god needs faith god needs an atmosphere
[1:14:12] on faith
[1:14:17] god say you know what since you want to
[1:14:18] act since you want to be a little
[1:14:22] i'm just going to go ahead and just
[1:14:23] close your mouth all together
[1:14:27] for the full term
[1:14:29] of the of the of the making of the body
[1:14:31] of john inside of his mom's belly
[1:14:35] he wasn't going to be able to say one
[1:14:36] doubting word
[1:14:38] to nobody
[1:14:44] [Music]
[1:14:47] god was preserving the atmosphere
[1:14:53] he says and the preacher questioned the
[1:14:55] angel
[1:14:56] how can it be
[1:14:58] i'm old and my wife is old he had plenty
[1:15:01] of examples in the bible there had been
[1:15:04] hannah in the temple he says that that
[1:15:06] had samuel the prophet after he was old
[1:15:09] he says and there had been sarah who
[1:15:11] brought forth isaac after she was nearly
[1:15:14] 100 years old he says and here this
[1:15:16] little woman had a head listen
[1:15:18] concerning mary here this little woman
[1:15:21] had to believe something that had never
[1:15:23] happened
[1:15:28] a woman having a baby without knowing a
[1:15:30] man she said how shall these things be
[1:15:33] my lord he said the holy ghost shall
[1:15:36] overshadow you
[1:15:38] so as you look at yourself and your
[1:15:40] problems
[1:15:41] as we near the time of the rapture and
[1:15:44] we take that self-inventory you might
[1:15:46] ask yourself how shall these things be
[1:15:50] but i say to you what it says right here
[1:15:52] the power of the most high the holy
[1:15:54] ghost is going to overshadow you and
[1:15:56] bring me past what he said he was going
[1:15:59] to do in your life
[1:16:02] but he needs our faith
[1:16:04] he needs our belief
[1:16:07] just taking him at his word
[1:16:09] whatever listen that was a messenger
[1:16:11] that brought a message to mary and god
[1:16:13] sent a messenger to bring a message to
[1:16:16] us
[1:16:18] he shall have an invincible army isn't
[1:16:21] that right he shall have a church
[1:16:23] without sparta blemish a wrinkle
[1:16:25] she said i'll be a super church
[1:16:28] isn't that right
[1:16:31] she will be just like him do you believe
[1:16:34] that
[1:16:36] [Music]
[1:16:48] and here this little woman had to
[1:16:49] believe something that had never
[1:16:51] happened a woman having a baby without
[1:16:53] knowing a man
[1:16:55] she said how shall these things be my
[1:16:57] lord he said the holy ghost shall
[1:16:59] overshadow thee in the holy and and the
[1:17:02] holy thing that be that'll be born from
[1:17:04] you will be called the son of god he
[1:17:07] says watch her
[1:17:09] she didn't question that
[1:17:11] she said behold the handmaid of the lord
[1:17:14] being unto me according to thy word
[1:17:18] before she even saw anything
[1:17:21] you know how it is with us right
[1:17:24] we pray about something we're waiting on
[1:17:26] something right
[1:17:28] and as long as we can see things
[1:17:29] seemingly moving in our favor
[1:17:34] then we come to church shouting the
[1:17:35] praises of god
[1:17:37] oh praise god
[1:17:40] because the sense has done declared
[1:17:42] something that looked like god is moving
[1:17:46] through my senses i've been comforted
[1:17:50] so now i'm coming to church and i'm on
[1:17:51] fire
[1:17:53] because because my my eyes are whatever
[1:17:55] and declared that god is moving on my
[1:17:57] behalf i got a letter i got a phone call
[1:18:00] or whatever the case might be
[1:18:02] but what if you have nothing
[1:18:07] you understand we're talking about a
[1:18:09] different level of believing here
[1:18:11] well you ain't got no sign that nothing
[1:18:14] is happening at all
[1:18:15] can you still believe the word of god
[1:18:18] can you still give praise to god
[1:18:21] no matter what you see
[1:18:24] situations might even get worse
[1:18:26] can you still give praise to god
[1:18:30] just as much as you would if you
[1:18:32] received it
[1:18:38] brother branham said when you got that
[1:18:39] 25 cents you can rejoice like you got
[1:18:42] the bread even though you ain't got the
[1:18:44] bread yet
[1:18:46] and now 25 cents is all faith
[1:18:48] isn't that right
[1:19:00] but see now listen saying satan don't
[1:19:01] like this
[1:19:06] listen now i'm talking about right now
[1:19:09] god is here but satan is here
[1:19:12] angels are here but demons are here
[1:19:14] and they want to try to break the
[1:19:16] influence of the word and the power of
[1:19:18] god how through blocking our men our
[1:19:21] mentalities
[1:19:23] notice how the prophet says this
[1:19:26] same message he says if we could just do
[1:19:29] that
[1:19:30] talking about mary be it unto me
[1:19:32] according to thy word
[1:19:34] i ain't seen nothing yet i i don't feel
[1:19:37] nothing yet i don't even see how it's
[1:19:39] going to happen
[1:19:43] sometimes people's situation saying
[1:19:45] seems so far like it's so it's such a
[1:19:48] dire need you don't need to see how it's
[1:19:51] going to happen
[1:19:53] and the devil want to draw our
[1:19:55] attentions right there
[1:19:58] we'll come to church
[1:20:00] we'll hear a good word we'll rejoice god
[1:20:02] will lift our faith up and then when you
[1:20:04] go to sleep tonight or wake up tomorrow
[1:20:06] the satan satan is trying to pull your
[1:20:08] mind right back
[1:20:10] to that doubting spot
[1:20:12] to make you listen now
[1:20:14] to make you
[1:20:16] question
[1:20:18] just a little question
[1:20:20] listen watch how he says this
[1:20:23] watch how he says this
[1:20:25] it says that's what god loves watch he
[1:20:28] says that's the only way to get right
[1:20:30] with god is to take him at his word he
[1:20:33] says that's the only way that there is
[1:20:34] to that there is to please god is take
[1:20:37] his word he says don't trust your
[1:20:39] knowledge
[1:20:41] don't trust your knowledge he says amen
[1:20:44] he says your reason
[1:20:47] how can it be done
[1:20:49] [Music]
[1:20:50] see that that's the kind of questioning
[1:20:52] satan wants to bring
[1:20:54] how how shall these things be
[1:20:57] yeah you you know his favorite tactic
[1:21:01] is to make us feel like that word it was
[1:21:03] for everybody else
[1:21:06] and somehow you this little special case
[1:21:09] that it don't apply to
[1:21:14] how many know he's a liar
[1:21:17] but the key to that is being able to
[1:21:19] recognize his voice
[1:21:20] and not just say oh that was just me
[1:21:22] thinking no no no no no no no
[1:21:25] the devil speaks to us in many ways and
[1:21:27] times and we don't even realize it
[1:21:30] he wants us to think it's just us
[1:21:34] because when you think it's just you now
[1:21:35] you just think it's all wrapped up into
[1:21:37] the person that you are and it's not
[1:21:40] it's something satan is trying to
[1:21:41] project to your mind to make you receive
[1:21:44] it as though it's yourself when it's not
[1:21:46] yourself
[1:21:47] it's him
[1:21:51] satan come to people and say now you
[1:21:53] know you want to kill
[1:21:54] yourself you ain't got no nothing worth
[1:21:57] living for
[1:21:58] everything is going wrong
[1:22:01] you know you'll be better off dead
[1:22:03] nobody really don't love you you know
[1:22:05] and things like that and so you know
[1:22:06] just go ahead and do them a favor too
[1:22:08] and just go ahead and take your life and
[1:22:09] just be done with all these issues and
[1:22:11] problems
[1:22:17] in the grace of god
[1:22:21] it's a sermon brother stephen i ain't
[1:22:22] preached yet i've been holding it for
[1:22:24] about i guess about six seven months
[1:22:26] the god who cares
[1:22:29] here it is the prophet sitting down in a
[1:22:31] service
[1:22:32] and all these people and i don't know
[1:22:34] how many people much more than what's in
[1:22:36] here it was an auditorium i believe here
[1:22:38] it is that little man down there but
[1:22:40] he's in tune with god
[1:22:42] and there's a son that needs help
[1:22:45] hey man brother brandon don't know the
[1:22:46] man he's a finite man brother brown is
[1:22:49] he don't know nothing but he's down
[1:22:50] there and all of a sudden
[1:22:52] he calls out he says soldier boy
[1:22:55] you're not going to commit suicide
[1:22:57] [Music]
[1:23:05] you're talking about oh
[1:23:08] the god who cares
[1:23:11] that man was contemplating taking his
[1:23:14] own life
[1:23:15] and god knew all about it
[1:23:17] and he took the time to pause and speak
[1:23:19] a specific word to that man that
[1:23:22] delivered him and saved his life
[1:23:25] but that's how the devil operates he
[1:23:27] want to push us to those places where we
[1:23:30] feel like hey i can't take no more
[1:23:33] i've reached my limits
[1:23:35] but how many know that's a lie
[1:23:37] as i was talking to a few of my friends
[1:23:40] the bible said that god won't put no
[1:23:41] more on you
[1:23:46] how many believe that
[1:23:48] so whenever you feel like you can't take
[1:23:50] no more you're about to break and then
[1:23:53] you don't reach your limits or whatever
[1:23:54] the case might be just you just just i
[1:23:57] pray i pray god help you at that time
[1:24:00] to realize you know what that's not what
[1:24:01] the word says
[1:24:03] [Music]
[1:24:05] if i'm in this place that means god want
[1:24:07] to do something
[1:24:13] watch these things
[1:24:15] he says don't trust your knowledge your
[1:24:17] reason how can it be done he says it
[1:24:19] cannot be done that's the reasoning see
[1:24:22] he says when you reason listen
[1:24:24] when you reason or when you allow the
[1:24:26] devil to cause you to question
[1:24:29] whether a promise can be brought to pass
[1:24:31] in your life or not
[1:24:33] brother branham says here when you
[1:24:35] reason then you lose the victory
[1:24:40] just at allowing yourself to question
[1:24:43] [Music]
[1:24:48] because when you allow yourself to
[1:24:49] question
[1:24:51] right
[1:24:55] that's what reasonings reasoning brings
[1:24:57] in questioning
[1:24:58] and then questioning breeds doubt
[1:25:06] can we say praise the lord sayings
[1:25:08] yes sir thank you brother
[1:25:13] i've been watching a few of y'all
[1:25:14] services there
[1:25:16] you know y'all been eating real good
[1:25:17] here
[1:25:20] hey man
[1:25:21] i say that because i see brother stephen
[1:25:23] he'd be up here with all them town
[1:25:26] he says everybody clear
[1:25:34] it's good i want everybody to be clear
[1:25:35] though brother i thank god for you man
[1:25:38] amen so i ain't gonna try to be like
[1:25:40] brother stephen
[1:25:42] i'll just be brother mcbride
[1:25:47] praise the lord
[1:25:52] all right
[1:25:53] so now let's you know we we've looked at
[1:25:55] that side of it
[1:25:57] reasoning will cause you to lose the
[1:25:59] victory
[1:26:00] so even though that seems to be a common
[1:26:02] i know it's a common kind of way about
[1:26:04] us when we allow just little questions
[1:26:06] to come up but the bible says we got to
[1:26:08] bring every thought into captivity
[1:26:10] and we got to cast down
[1:26:14] right
[1:26:15] because that's how the enemy tries to
[1:26:17] infiltrate our minds because once he can
[1:26:18] control of our minds then he can control
[1:26:20] us to a certain degree
[1:26:23] so now let's kind of switch it over a
[1:26:24] little bit
[1:26:26] now brother branham says here in a
[1:26:28] message called jesus christ the same
[1:26:30] yesterday today and forever he says in
[1:26:32] the garden of eden satan chose his part
[1:26:34] of the man his head his intellectuals he
[1:26:37] says god took his heart the
[1:26:38] intellectuals will reason in your mind
[1:26:41] he says i'm this way and i'm that way
[1:26:43] you will never get anywhere with god he
[1:26:45] says there he says but your heart he
[1:26:48] says your faith will make you believe
[1:26:50] things that your mind knows nothing
[1:26:52] about
[1:26:59] amen
[1:27:00] he says you cast down reasonings he says
[1:27:03] see you must be positive and stay there
[1:27:06] until you are positive then when you are
[1:27:08] positive there's nothing can turn you
[1:27:14] you see so it's a battle
[1:27:16] it's not a cakewalk
[1:27:18] it's something that you and i have to
[1:27:20] continuously fight for
[1:27:22] didn't he say you gotta fight for every
[1:27:24] inch of ground that you possess
[1:27:26] that's deadly that's constantly it don't
[1:27:29] let up do it brother
[1:27:38] it don't let up
[1:27:40] like i said it's going on even right now
[1:27:44] some people are struggling in their
[1:27:46] minds
[1:27:48] you hear the word of god and you feel
[1:27:49] the pull
[1:27:51] but satan don't want you to get the
[1:27:52] victory
[1:27:53] [Music]
[1:27:54] and in that service when brother branham
[1:27:56] was there see now he began to see
[1:27:57] spirits
[1:27:59] and we saw a person beginning to believe
[1:28:01] he said he would see the spirit upon
[1:28:03] that person call out to another spirit
[1:28:05] to come over and help it
[1:28:08] now it's not a strange scene
[1:28:10] so what was taking place at that moment
[1:28:12] it was false
[1:28:14] thoughts in a person's mind
[1:28:16] and that spirit was calling another
[1:28:18] spirit to try to bring in more thoughts
[1:28:20] to bombard the person's mind to make
[1:28:23] them buckle
[1:28:25] to make them lose sight of the word
[1:28:27] they've been actually hearing and now to
[1:28:29] begin focus more on a problem than the
[1:28:31] promise
[1:28:39] well the banner says i'm not worthy to
[1:28:41] stand up here
[1:28:43] but he called me to do it
[1:28:46] that's exactly how brother mcbride feel
[1:28:49] amen
[1:28:50] i'm not worthy to stand up here but he
[1:28:52] called me to do it you're not worthy to
[1:28:54] be a christian he says but god made you
[1:28:56] one he says this temple is not worthy to
[1:28:58] stand on this ground but god said it
[1:29:01] here he says that's it he says it ain't
[1:29:03] it ain't what you are is what he is
[1:29:06] everybody's always looking at their
[1:29:08] self amen he says why you say why you
[1:29:12] can't look at yourself and get anywhere
[1:29:14] he says you are finished to begin with
[1:29:17] you are a failure to start with there's
[1:29:19] nothing to you to begin with it's what
[1:29:22] god made you he says it's what you are
[1:29:26] he says god don't even see you
[1:29:29] he sees your sacrifice
[1:29:32] isn't that right
[1:29:35] can we say praise the lord say this
[1:29:40] oh lord
[1:29:43] all right so now there's a promise right
[1:29:46] and
[1:29:47] for whatever we're going through there's
[1:29:49] a word that pertains to us it just takes
[1:29:52] the leading of god to help us to see it
[1:29:56] to come across it the thumb through
[1:29:57] those pages and your eyes and your heart
[1:29:59] land upon a place
[1:30:02] and the next thing you know you feel
[1:30:03] that once you begin to read it you begin
[1:30:05] it's almost like your soul is drinking
[1:30:07] that
[1:30:09] a cold drink of water in a dry land
[1:30:12] it just feels so refreshing because it's
[1:30:15] a word in due season isn't that right
[1:30:20] [Music]
[1:30:21] you remember we said that you can't even
[1:30:23] you can't even believe on your own
[1:30:24] brother
[1:30:27] i know you're hearing a good word
[1:30:30] i know you go home and you try to give
[1:30:32] time to the word and things of that
[1:30:33] nature
[1:30:34] amen and we've been in those places we
[1:30:37] know that we've spent time in the word
[1:30:39] and whatever but we still find ourselves
[1:30:41] doubting
[1:30:43] we still find ourselves struggling at
[1:30:45] times losing sight of the promise and
[1:30:47] focusing in on the problem
[1:30:50] unless god keep us saints we can't be
[1:30:52] kept
[1:30:55] we're not strong enough
[1:30:57] we're not wise enough
[1:30:59] we don't have enough knowledge
[1:31:01] we can't do it unless god do it it won't
[1:31:03] be done
[1:31:06] but notice what the prophet says here
[1:31:10] it says when god oh lord
[1:31:14] when i read this
[1:31:18] everybody listening
[1:31:22] everybody listening real good
[1:31:24] i'm saying that because this is a nugget
[1:31:26] now i'm about to pass something real
[1:31:28] valuable on to you it's a nugget now
[1:31:30] i'ma tell you exactly where it's at and
[1:31:32] everything you can go back and get it
[1:31:34] print it out do whatever you got to do
[1:31:36] you can polish it up and go back and
[1:31:37] look at it again
[1:31:42] this is from the message called mary's
[1:31:43] belief
[1:31:44] 1959
[1:31:46] april the 9th
[1:31:50] it says when god put something upon a
[1:31:53] person's heart
[1:31:59] many times you find yourselves with
[1:32:01] certain things on your heart
[1:32:04] a desire to receive something to receive
[1:32:07] the holy ghost to receive more of the
[1:32:09] holy ghost to receive healing to receive
[1:32:13] something or another
[1:32:15] and you feel that thing in your heart
[1:32:17] and you begin to kind of speak about it
[1:32:19] a little bit
[1:32:21] many times we don't realize what that is
[1:32:23] we're not able to capture the moment per
[1:32:26] se
[1:32:27] to really know that that's god
[1:32:31] that's god actually putting that thing
[1:32:33] on your heart like that watch this now
[1:32:35] he says when god puts something upon a
[1:32:38] person's heart he's ready to do
[1:32:41] something
[1:32:53] i don't want to gloss over that
[1:32:56] when god puts up what do you have on
[1:32:58] your heart right now that pertains to
[1:33:00] the things of god what's been impressed
[1:33:02] upon your heart
[1:33:04] the cause you to seek after whatever the
[1:33:06] promises might be that's just in your
[1:33:08] heart like that what's doing that what
[1:33:09] brought that to you
[1:33:10] [Music]
[1:33:12] is that just you
[1:33:13] is that because i i heard the word
[1:33:15] brother they put it on my mind no what's
[1:33:17] impressing that on your heart like that
[1:33:21] it's god
[1:33:23] but if it's being impressed on your
[1:33:25] heart that means god is standing right
[1:33:27] there ready to do it
[1:33:36] you want the bible for that
[1:33:38] you want the scripture for that
[1:33:40] huh
[1:33:43] here's the scripture now write the
[1:33:44] scripture down philippians chapter 2 and
[1:33:47] verse 13.
[1:33:48] it says for it is god
[1:33:51] which worketh in you
[1:33:53] both to will and to do with his good
[1:33:56] pleasure
[1:33:59] so that will that you have that desire
[1:34:01] that you have to receive a certain thing
[1:34:04] from god god put that desire there and
[1:34:07] the reason why you put it there because
[1:34:08] he's ready to perform it in your life
[1:34:12] don't let the devil take that away from
[1:34:14] you
[1:34:16] [Music]
[1:34:25] can we say praise the lord
[1:34:29] i'm gonna leave you with this
[1:34:32] the message again marries on various
[1:34:35] beliefs same year 59 april the 9th
[1:34:39] this is paragraph 9 he says and you know
[1:34:42] it's usually when you're thinking about
[1:34:44] god and keeping our minds on god that
[1:34:46] god comes close to us
[1:34:49] he says i think that's one of the great
[1:34:51] troubles of the people of this day we
[1:34:53] have too many other things on our mind
[1:34:58] even when we come to the to a healing
[1:35:00] service we seem to think well did i get
[1:35:03] a prayer card or a prayer card tonight
[1:35:07] see that's that's the reasoning of the
[1:35:08] devil
[1:35:10] how many times we've listened to a
[1:35:12] prayer service and the lord completely
[1:35:15] leaves the prayer line
[1:35:18] and moves out into the congregation to
[1:35:21] somebody didn't even have a prayer call
[1:35:26] why because they will believe in god
[1:35:29] their faith pulled the pillow fire to
[1:35:32] their situation
[1:35:37] now how many realize you have that same
[1:35:40] capability
[1:35:42] you can pull the pillar of fire directly
[1:35:45] to your situation
[1:35:48] [Music]
[1:35:53] i think that's the one great trouble he
[1:35:55] said to the people of this day we have
[1:35:57] too many other things on our mind even
[1:35:59] when we come to a healing service we
[1:36:01] seem to think well i did not get a
[1:36:03] prayer card tonight or perhaps i'll not
[1:36:06] be prayed for he says we will never be
[1:36:09] able to accomplish much as long as we
[1:36:12] keep those kind of thoughts
[1:36:17] whether you get a prayer call tonight
[1:36:20] whether you get prayed for or not
[1:36:23] amen
[1:36:24] the woman with the blood issue
[1:36:28] it didn't matter
[1:36:30] she was locked in
[1:36:34] and brother branham said she had to
[1:36:36] believe for something she didn't have a
[1:36:38] scripture to be able to go back to
[1:36:45] but see that's what an anointed faith
[1:36:47] will do
[1:36:54] praise the lord
[1:36:58] is everybody clear
[1:37:03] amen
[1:37:05] keep me in prayer saints
[1:37:08] i need your prayer i solicit your
[1:37:09] prayers
[1:37:12] i'm done i feel led to stop
[1:37:16] but i believe you understand
[1:37:19] simple message
[1:37:22] like i said it's ministering to me
[1:37:26] amen
[1:37:28] simple faith in god's word
[1:37:31] amen you gotta fight for it the devil is
[1:37:34] gonna fight us so we gotta fight back
[1:37:35] isn't that right
[1:37:37] we gotta fight to keep our focus
[1:37:41] because god is ready to manifest the
[1:37:42] promise
[1:37:44] let us all stand together
[1:37:47] and let's give the lord a handclap for
[1:37:48] praise
[1:38:00] praise the lord
[1:38:03] i'm not going to call a prayer line
[1:38:06] because
[1:38:08] whether you come into a prayer line or
[1:38:09] not you still got to believe
[1:38:13] so in light of what was just
[1:38:15] emphasized to our hearts let us just bow
[1:38:19] heavenly father
[1:38:21] lord we're grateful
[1:38:24] we're grateful for your mercy and your
[1:38:26] grace
[1:38:29] that show that that you constantly pull
[1:38:31] out upon our lives so undeservingly lord
[1:38:37] we're not deserving of anything that
[1:38:39] comes from you father but
[1:38:41] at the same time lord you see fit to
[1:38:43] give us everything that you've given us
[1:38:46] because your view of us is much higher
[1:38:48] than our view of ourselves
[1:38:52] and as your prophet taught us in perfect
[1:38:54] strength and perfect weaknesses lord we
[1:38:56] don't want to make our weaknesses
[1:38:58] excuses
[1:39:00] he says because that can hinder us also
[1:39:02] it's good for us to know that we're
[1:39:03] nothing
[1:39:05] but yet we want to be able to still
[1:39:06] allow you to help us to see who you made
[1:39:09] us to be
[1:39:12] it's not who we are within ourselves but
[1:39:14] it's what you've called us to be as what
[1:39:16] we are to you
[1:39:18] and we are your chosen we are your bride
[1:39:21] we are your elect
[1:39:24] god it's many times difficult to see
[1:39:27] things in the right light especially
[1:39:28] when you're in the midst of opposition
[1:39:32] oftentimes lord we
[1:39:34] we find ourselves failing you
[1:39:37] and being able to hold to a positive
[1:39:39] mindset
[1:39:41] but we want to say thank you for the way
[1:39:43] that you've made for us
[1:39:45] and how you work with us lord and your
[1:39:47] longsuffering toward us father
[1:39:50] and you pick us up lord
[1:39:52] you give us further instruction you
[1:39:54] comfort our hearts father
[1:39:57] lord it's just a blessing to be a part
[1:39:59] of your family and a part of your
[1:40:01] economy
[1:40:04] well we pray for every soul that's here
[1:40:07] i know there are issues that are
[1:40:08] presently here lord amongst us father
[1:40:12] physical issues lord mental issues
[1:40:14] spiritual issues lord
[1:40:16] there's all sorts of things father god
[1:40:18] but you are still the great physician
[1:40:22] and you're here right now father and
[1:40:23] even the word that you've allowed us to
[1:40:26] hear tonight it was sent forth to heal
[1:40:29] and to deliver lord god
[1:40:32] lord help me to receive the very word
[1:40:34] that was spoken out on my lips
[1:40:38] help me to believe you lord
[1:40:41] even as the
[1:40:43] the young man's father said unto you he
[1:40:46] says lord i believe but help my unbelief
[1:40:51] granted father god
[1:40:54] we love you help us to love you more
[1:40:57] bless this church continuously we pray
[1:40:59] father
[1:41:01] you've been doing so much all over the
[1:41:03] world amongst your bride lord and we say
[1:41:05] thank you for that
[1:41:07] thank you for every little thing lord
[1:41:09] thank you for every big thing father
[1:41:12] we thank you for all things lord
[1:41:19] we ask all these things in your name
[1:41:21] the name of our lord and savior jesus
[1:41:24] christ
[1:41:25] amen
[1:41:27] amen god bless you

[1:42:36] what a desire

[1:42:41] and i gave that person this answer i say
[1:42:44] brother branham say and down the road
[1:42:46] you will see it because you got to see
[1:42:48] where you are first
[1:42:50] and you see your situation then the lord
[1:42:52] opened up the door
[1:42:54] brother branham said that the same holy
[1:42:57] spirit
[1:42:58] that caught you
[1:43:00] and justify you
[1:43:04] are you okay
[1:43:05] he is the one that's going to sanctify
[1:43:09] and he is the one that's going to bring
[1:43:11] you all the way to the baptism of the
[1:43:14] holy spirit
[1:43:16] i say sister the deacon was there i said
[1:43:18] there's only one thing you have to do
[1:43:21] just obey
[1:43:22] that's why you heard brother branham
[1:43:25] saying that
[1:43:26] obedience
[1:43:28] entitle you
[1:43:30] to the token
[1:43:32] in other words when god says something
[1:43:34] to you
[1:43:36] just receive it like mary
[1:43:40] and move on receive it like mary and as
[1:43:43] you are receiving it
[1:43:44] and doing what god says to do
[1:43:48] automatically you are moving
[1:43:51] without understanding until one of this
[1:43:54] day you're gonna look back and you say
[1:43:56] wait a minute
[1:43:57] i thought i was struggling something
[1:43:59] last year but i don't know what happened
[1:44:03] the lord will allow a test to come and
[1:44:06] you will see like you overcome the test
[1:44:08] and you say wait a minute
[1:44:09] is this me or not
[1:44:11] usually when this kind of stuff happened
[1:44:13] to me
[1:44:14] i react a certain way you already been
[1:44:17] dead
[1:44:18] that's why the devil
[1:44:20] is fighting with a stubborn spirit
[1:44:23] when the word come you rejected
[1:44:26] hallelujah
[1:44:27] very simple my brother
[1:44:30] i'm gonna read the quote
[1:44:32] hallelujah
[1:44:34] it's unbelievable
[1:44:36] amen
[1:44:37] brother branham i have a quote i was
[1:44:39] reading and brother branham say the
[1:44:41] baptism of the holy spirit i'm
[1:44:43] paraphrasing
[1:44:45] is based on predestination
[1:44:50] in other words somehow
[1:44:54] you gonna be pushed
[1:44:56] into the holiest
[1:45:00] whether you like it or not if god have
[1:45:03] to whoop you he's going to whoop you
[1:45:06] until you get there
[1:45:11] so you be you better come the easiest
[1:45:13] way quickly
[1:45:16] brother branham says this
[1:45:18] hallelujah
[1:45:20] he says
[1:45:22] that is
[1:45:23] what power is in the church now
[1:45:26] but it is controlled by a law
[1:45:30] and our law
[1:45:32] is not keeping a bunch of commandments
[1:45:34] it's a law of faith
[1:45:37] it started at the brazen altar right
[1:45:39] there the fundamental foundation right
[1:45:41] there hey buddy he says and if you can
[1:45:46] jesus say all things are possible to
[1:45:48] them that believe
[1:45:50] and if you can believe it whatever god
[1:45:54] will lead your soul
[1:45:56] to believe that is
[1:45:59] yours
[1:46:00] that heart the brother was talking about
[1:46:03] is your soul
[1:46:04] when the lord impresses something on
[1:46:06] your soul
[1:46:08] automatically he's there to perform
[1:46:12] let me ask you a question
[1:46:14] who do you believe
[1:46:16] based not what based on what i say
[1:46:19] not me
[1:46:21] based on your experience
[1:46:23] since we got in this church
[1:46:27] let me start it again based on your
[1:46:29] experience your own history
[1:46:32] since we started from the hotel up to
[1:46:35] now who do you think is leading this
[1:46:38] church
[1:46:40] not because of me i want i want to hear
[1:46:42] from you who's doing it
[1:46:45] the lord jesus christ it's the holy
[1:46:47] ghost doing it okay
[1:46:49] so if the holy ghost is bringing a
[1:46:52] sermon and putting that in me
[1:46:55] to deliver it
[1:46:57] do you hear me and that sermon is
[1:47:00] telling you check where you are
[1:47:02] you need to be going to the holiest
[1:47:05] what do you think god is telling you
[1:47:08] [Music]
[1:47:10] did you get it
[1:47:12] did you get it
[1:47:14] in other words god has opened a door
[1:47:22] the message is anybody that has been
[1:47:25] struggling
[1:47:26] go ahead quickly and enter
[1:47:32] that's why he is opening the word so you
[1:47:36] can see him clearly and say okay i am
[1:47:39] justified i need help then he say come
[1:47:42] on quickly i already opened the door
[1:47:45] that is the language
[1:47:47] anything the lord bring in your heart
[1:47:50] anything the lord is bringing on this
[1:47:52] pulpit
[1:47:54] belongs to you
[1:47:58] how can god talk to you about getting in
[1:48:00] the holy ghost without him opening the
[1:48:02] door for you to get in a hole yes
[1:48:06] some are getting stuck into something no
[1:48:08] all he's trying to tell you is look what
[1:48:10] you have been doing look at your
[1:48:12] marriage do you see that okay look where
[1:48:15] i want you to go
[1:48:16] you don't have nothing to do just
[1:48:18] approach and go ahead i just open the
[1:48:21] door move quickly
[1:48:23] because the gentile door is about to be
[1:48:26] closed
[1:48:27] go ahead quickly and get into a rest
[1:48:30] when you get in the rest in the holiest
[1:48:33] then your hands are off your life
[1:48:35] and the holy spirit is leading you

[1:48:54] painful but i'm saying thirsty is a
[1:48:57] painful desire it's like you can't help
[1:48:59] it when you tell somebody people look at
[1:49:01] you like you're crazy

[1:49:10] some of you will have your head spin
[1:49:14] i told somebody i said do you believe
[1:49:16] about paying your house off
[1:49:18] before i was a pastor because somebody
[1:49:19] would say he got in the taff
[1:49:26] i start believing that before i was a
[1:49:28] pastor when i was a deacon
[1:49:30] because i read certain things in the
[1:49:32] scripture
