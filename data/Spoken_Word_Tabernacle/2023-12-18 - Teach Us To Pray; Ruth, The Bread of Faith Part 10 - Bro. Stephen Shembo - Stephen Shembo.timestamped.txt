[38:36] bread of Joseph is a bread that is a
[38:38] mixture of the seven breads it is the
[38:41] light of the Moon that looks like the
[38:43] light of how many days seven days that's
[38:46] why Jero the seven days he have to be
[38:48] turned how many times seven
[38:50] times because we got to pick up the
[38:53] mysterious end this is what brother Bram
[38:55] said brother I'm say the reason this the
[38:59] reason that all the straying ends of the
[39:02] mysterious part of what justification so
[39:05] justification even though it was
[39:07] preached by Luther there were still a
[39:09] mysterious part he said the mysterious
[39:11] part of what sanctification and the
[39:14] Mysterious part of what the baptism of
[39:16] the Holy Ghost this is where the
[39:17] Pentecostal cannot get you only get this
[39:20] by the bread of Joseph amen only Christ
[39:23] can give it to you amen they can go only
[39:26] up to a certain level he says what kind
[39:30] did Eve eat an apple or did she eat a
[39:33] palm grenade or something what was the
[39:35] serpent seed and is the baptism in the
[39:37] name of the father Son and Holy Ghost or
[39:39] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ right
[39:41] or hundreds of those things that has
[39:44] been how left loose they were left Loose
[39:47] by a per for a purpose because the
[39:50] messenger of the last day have to gather
[39:52] all the loand and put him together amen
[39:56] and then give us a full message amen so
[39:58] what we receive is a full package amen a
[40:02] message of perfection amen that's why

[40:09] perfect amen it's the Capstone everybody
[40:13] together amen amen do you know that even
[40:16] Joseph has a portion of a
[40:20] land do you know that Joseph had a
[40:23] portion of the land the land of Goan
[40:26] amen that was given to Israel that's why
[40:29] they told Brother Bram that's a portion
[40:31] of Heaven
[40:34] amen will be given unto thee so
[40:37] everything in this message line
[40:39] perfectly with the Holy
[40:42] Scripture have you thought about it so

[50:23] going quickly with me we could be
[50:25] already finishing this one amen he says
[50:27] when you reap the Harvest of your land

[50:39] the gleaning of thy Harvest means
[50:43] whenever the reaper are working
[50:46] everybody okay amen if something
[50:50] accidentally let's use it now use the
[50:53] word accidentally if

[50:58] hand of the reaper don't pick it
[51:05] up can you say amen
[51:08] amen so the corner of the edes and what
[51:13] and the gleaning or whatever Falls or
[51:17] whatever drop as you Gathering the field

[51:23] amen everybody okay in other word from
[51:27] your 100% of your
[51:30] Harvest God split your
[51:34] harvest in two
[51:36] part I'm going
[51:39] slowly you have a certain percentage can
[51:42] I pick up a percentage yes can I pick so
[51:45] we agree that I picked I don't have a
[51:48] quote or a scripture I'm just picking
[51:51] okay okay you take 80% that's it I just
[51:58] picked amen and we
[52:01] supposed that 20% let me put it here
[52:06] supposingly is what makes out the
[52:09] corners amen the ages amen and the
[52:14] gleaning are we
[52:16] together are we together we clear so far
[52:20] amen out of this
[52:23] 80% follow me carefully this is where
[52:27] you take your
[52:32] tthing say amen
[52:38] amen are we together so who does the 20%
[52:44] belong to
[52:47] who normally we don't know what the
[52:50] percentage is because we don't know how
[52:53] much will fall that's right
[52:56] we don't know how much is the corners so
[52:59] in other word this supposing 20% does it
[53:04] have a certain
[53:11] number it's an
[53:14] unknown
[53:16] number or an unknown measure we don't
[53:21] know whether it's going to be 10% or
[53:23] it's going to be uh I mean 20% or we
[53:25] don't
[53:26] know amen but the one that is
[53:30] responsible for this is God
[53:34] Amen everybody okay everybody good so as
[53:38] you working on your field amen the holy
[53:42] spirit will move on
[53:45] you and cause you to
[53:49] accidentally on
[53:52] now drop something purposely
[53:56] amen and you think oh I made a mistake
[53:59] it is not
[54:01] you it is God that is withdrawing
[54:08] something for
[54:11] who verse
[54:14] 10 sorry I didn't know he was a
[54:16] different Canon so let me inform you
[54:19] it's a different weapon amen amen verse
[54:22] 10 and you shall not gleed your what
[54:26] Vineyard neither shall you gather what
[54:29] every grape of thy Vineyard when they
[54:31] say every grape it means when you are
[54:34] picking up the grape what will happen to
[54:36] the grape fall some will fall don't pick
[54:39] up you think it's an accident it is not
[54:43] an accident watch what's going on Amen
[54:47] you shall leave them for who the
[54:51] poor and who The
[54:54] Stranger
[54:58] am so God says that this percentage here
[55:03] that we don't know really the number is
[55:06] or belongs to who the poor and the
[55:09] stranger the poor and who
[55:14] stranger everybody okay amen so a
[55:17] portion of your
[55:19] Harvest can you say amen amen goes to
[55:23] the poor amen amen
[55:30] that's
[55:31] why I hope everybody will listen to this

[56:01] understanding let me repeat it again a
[56:04] Judas understanding when they want to
[56:07] give unto the Lord Judas sees the
[56:10] poor and Jesus said the poor will always
[56:13] be with
[56:16] you don't never take your T money and

[1:38:03] according to the law amen was pushing

[1:38:12] footstep
[1:38:14] amen
[1:38:17] amen of the righteous our what
[1:38:21] of God so the GPS is not true sometime
[1:38:25] you g certain Road you don't understand
[1:38:29] why you getting the road but there is an
[1:38:31] expected
[1:38:32] end because the one that is maneuvering
[1:38:35] the plane is not
[1:38:37] you all things work together for what
[1:38:42] good maybe roof as she was moving she
[1:38:47] saw maybe a field there she say oh that
[1:38:49] is my field she ch to go and a dog begin
[1:38:52] to
[1:38:53] B say uhuh not the dog I don't like dog
[1:38:56] and she goes to the other she didn't
[1:38:58] know that God put that dog there to
[1:39:01] recalibrate
[1:39:06] her sometime the supervisor that hatur
[1:39:09] you he doesn't really Hur you he have to
[1:39:12] Hur you like Pharaoh so that you can go
[1:39:15] to the promised land
[1:39:18] am because that job is not your
[1:39:21] finality it is just a
[1:39:31] detol everybody together have I lost
[1:39:34] somebody that's why everything in your
[1:39:36] life is working together for good IM
[1:39:40] seems like it's working good but God is
[1:39:43] orchestrating
[1:39:45] everything to work according to the
[1:39:48] purpose of his own will
[1:39:53] rof thought I'm going to get food she
[1:39:57] didn't know which field she was going to
[1:39:59] and she fell by some chances which is
[1:40:02] not a chance because he was ordained by
[1:40:05] the Lord and she fell in the field of
[1:40:10] boas are we together amen and the field
[1:40:13] of boas like any other field had
[1:40:18] Corners he has edges he has cleaning
[1:40:22] drops
[1:40:25] there everybody okay are we together are
[1:40:28] we
[1:40:30] together are we
[1:40:32] together let me do this so I calm your
[1:40:36] nerve let's do this my subject this
[1:40:40] morning is Teachers to pray
[1:40:44] roof the bread of Faith
[1:40:47] amen so let me go back to my reading
[1:40:51] we okay now we clear now where are we at
[1:40:54] my friend verse four and behold who
[1:41:00] Boaz came from where
[1:41:03] Bethlehem he came from Bethlehem and
[1:41:06] said to who the Reapers the Lord be with
[1:41:10] you and they answer him saying what the
[1:41:12] Lord bless thee then said boas to who
[1:41:16] his
[1:41:18] servant that was what set over the
[1:41:21] Reapers What whose damsel is
[1:41:26] this should I say something oh you
[1:41:29] already got
[1:41:32] it boas has
[1:41:35] Reapers he had Reapers and all those
[1:41:39] Reaper had a
[1:41:42] supervisor that's right that was the
[1:41:45] chief
[1:41:46] Reaper amen so when boas came
[1:41:51] he came straight not to any
[1:41:58] Reaper he came only to the chief
[1:42:01] reap because in the absence of
[1:42:08] Boaz the field of boas is under the
[1:42:12] responsibility of the chief
[1:42:16] R and the absence of boas which is
[1:42:20] Christ
[1:42:21] the field of Christ is under the
[1:42:25] responsibility of the pastor of the ede
[1:42:28] amen is under the responsibility of the
[1:42:32] messenger of the AG
[1:42:35] amen that's why the messages are sent to
[1:42:39] the angel not to you to the
[1:42:43] angel not to you to the Angel and the
[1:42:46] angel take the message first and deliver
[1:42:49] the message to you so
[1:42:55] when that's why over over the curtain of
[1:43:00] time they told Brother Bram when Jesus
[1:43:03] Christ will return He will first come to
[1:43:06] you
[1:43:08] am he will ask you first amen and if you
[1:43:12] pass the test whoever is behind
[1:43:19] you
[1:43:22] and the multitude say we are resting on
[1:43:25] what that's why I'm resting this church
[1:43:29] upon the message of the
[1:43:30] [Applause]
[1:43:39] hour they pray you don't go to
[1:43:43] Pharaoh when you go to Pharaoh Pharaoh
[1:43:45] say ask
[1:43:46] [Applause]
[1:43:49] who
[1:43:50] [Applause]
[1:43:54] so are we okay amen according to the
[1:43:57] setting here we begin to
[1:44:00] understand we went through n the
[1:44:03] messages with Pro this is the layer and
[1:44:06] and it is L 92 okay so I'm really
[1:44:09] pulling the files there that's where I
[1:44:11] am okay so according to the setting here
[1:44:15] we begin to understand that when rof was
[1:44:19] approaching the field of Boaz are you
[1:44:21] following me Boaz was not
[1:44:27] there am I reading a different Bible who
[1:44:30] was there the chief Reaper and the chief
[1:44:34] Reaper have Reaper under him because
[1:44:37] every minister in this message is under
[1:44:40] the messenger
[1:44:42] amen our instruction is according to the
[1:44:46] chief Reaper amen the chief Reaper is
[1:44:48] responsible for Bas field
[1:44:51] when is not there William Bram is not
[1:44:54] there but the message is there the
[1:44:57] message and the messenger are what so we
[1:45:01] have the message that's why we have the
[1:45:03] chief Reaper
[1:45:05] [Applause]
[1:45:08] amen Have I Lost somebody have I lost
[1:45:11] somebody so we begin to understand that
[1:45:14] when rof enter the field amen she did
[1:45:18] not see bers yes sir she met
[1:45:22] somebody who is responsible for the
[1:45:24] field so the one who will give Ru the
