[36:28] [Music]
[36:43] jesus
[36:48] [Music]
[37:14] amen
[37:15] let's give the lord a clap off
[37:20] hallelujah you really made it despite
[37:24] the rain
[37:25] god richly bless you good to see you
[37:27] there brother mike
[37:29] amen amen amen amen praise the lord you
[37:32] see tracy you too
[37:34] oh okay no problem okay that's a family
[37:36] member in the house amen
[37:39] blessed be the name of the lord so i
[37:41] know it's wednesday
[37:43] so let's tighten up a little bit and
[37:45] move quickly
[37:46] how many are up to date with the sermon
[37:49] okay
[37:51] blessed be the name of the lord this
[37:53] coming sunday at 2 oh saturday at 2 30
[37:57] we have the young sisters meeting i
[38:00] believe the text is already gone
[38:02] but there was so
[38:04] much pull
[38:06] from the married sister
[38:09] a lot of polling
[38:10] that wanted to be there and when we look
[38:13] and discern their motive they just want
[38:16] to learn amen so that have been said
[38:20] the door is open to
[38:23] any married sister that wanted to be
[38:26] there
[38:27] but kindly remember it is not your
[38:30] meeting
[38:32] that's your past amen kindly remember it
[38:35] is for the young sister it is their
[38:38] question not your question so when you
[38:40] get there remember it is for the young
[38:43] sister you there just to learn
[38:46] amen
[38:48] so don't get into their way that's their
[38:51] time because when they're going to come
[38:53] when it will be a married meeting
[38:55] probably they'll they're not going to
[38:56] have a chance to get there amen
[39:01] somebody is having a trouble
[39:04] if you have an associate degree
[39:07] do you have a bachelor degree
[39:10] if somebody have a bachelor or degree
[39:12] they already have an associate degree
[39:13] right
[39:14] so the one with a bachelor degree can
[39:16] use their associate degree right
[39:18] but the one with associate degree cannot
[39:20] use a bachelor degree because they don't
[39:22] have it
[39:25] did they make sense
[39:27] so the mother can drop down to your
[39:29] meeting
[39:30] not you going there until you graduate
[39:34] that makes sense
[39:35] oh my god what a pressure
[39:38] [Laughter]
[39:40] so that has been covered amen so if you
[39:43] attend you are planning to attend
[39:46] as a
[39:47] merit sister make sure you inform one of
[39:50] the deacon quickly because the head
[39:52] count we have was only for the younger
[39:54] so we know how many are coming so we can
[39:57] boost up a little bit so that kind of
[40:01] quieten the nerves and everything in the
[40:03] church amen
[40:05] you need to thank the deacon
[40:09] let's go straight to our scripture thank
[40:11] you very much musician
[40:15] you thank the deacon
[40:23] i've never seen so much pull like that
[40:26] just pulling
[40:28] why why why but when you deserve the
[40:31] motive behind people are just thirsty
[40:33] and hungry for the world amen
[40:36] they rather sit in that meeting versus
[40:38] staying at home and doing nothing
[40:40] amen
[40:41] blessed be the name of the lord so your
[40:43] prayer has been answered
[40:48] and remember on sunday the building fund
[40:51] i believe i don't know if the trustees
[40:53] remind you but sunday the building fund
[40:56] amen
[40:57] let's go straight to our scripture
[40:59] on uh
[41:01] sunday we skip toward the end i say skip
[41:04] skip skip skip but this is a teaching on
[41:07] the baptism of the holy spirit i cannot
[41:11] skip stuff
[41:13] it is very important so i don't want to
[41:16] leave any screws loose
[41:19] i want to make sure we tighten them
[41:21] pretty tight amen
[41:23] because there's a lot of question over
[41:24] the years so we want to make sure we get
[41:26] everything clear amen
[41:28] blessed be the name of the lord let's go
[41:30] to second chronicle chapter six we wear
[41:32] this on sunday
[41:35] hallelujah
[41:43] ii chronicle chapter 6
[41:47] verse 10 if you dare you can say amen
[41:51] the bible say the lord therefore has
[41:53] performed you might be seated his word
[41:56] that he has spoken thank you
[41:58] for i am reason up in the room of david
[42:01] my father
[42:02] and
[42:03] i am said on and
[42:05] and
[42:06] i am said
[42:08] i am set on the throne of israel as the
[42:11] lord promised and have built the house
[42:14] for the name of the lord god of israel
[42:17] amen
[42:18] and in it have i put the ark where it is
[42:21] the covenant of the lord
[42:24] that he made with the children of israel
[42:27] and he stood
[42:29] before the altar of the lord you know
[42:32] where we are
[42:34] we are still on the
[42:36] other court
[42:37] and we are dealing with the brazen altar
[42:40] and the lever put together amen
[42:43] so solomon stood on the altar we know
[42:46] that's a brazen altar
[42:50] the brazen altar amen
[42:52] when he stood on the altar
[42:54] at the altar
[42:56] he stood before the altar of the lord in
[42:58] the presence of all the congregation of
[43:01] israel and spread forth his hands
[43:05] for solomon had made a brazen scaffold
[43:09] the altar was much bigger but it was a
[43:11] scaffold and this scaffold was made in
[43:14] reference to the brazen altar into the
[43:16] tabernacle amen this is now in the
[43:19] temple amen
[43:20] of five cubit long you remember this
[43:23] when we unfolded the mystery of the
[43:25] brazen altar and five cubit broad and
[43:28] three cubit high a man five five five
[43:30] grace and three cubic yard perfection
[43:33] and head set in the midst of the court
[43:35] so we are still dealing here in the
[43:38] other court
[43:41] if your other court is not good it's
[43:43] going to block everything down the road
[43:44] you remember on sunday amen and upon it
[43:47] he stood
[43:49] and kneeled down
[43:51] upon his knees before all the
[43:53] congregation of israel and spread forth
[43:56] his hand toward heaven you remember on
[43:59] chapter 7 the fire came down exactly
[44:02] like it happened for elijah amen
[44:04] let's go to luke chapter 18.
[44:11] hopefully lord willing if we can get to
[44:14] where i'm trying to go so on sunday we
[44:16] will get on the roof with a calvinist
[44:20] and luther and see if we can place your
[44:23] marriage in the outer court and the
[44:24] marriage in the holy place and the
[44:26] marriage in the holiest
[44:28] luke 18 verse 9. if you're there you can
[44:30] say amen
[44:32] and he spoke this parable you remember
[44:34] this now to certain which trusteth in
[44:38] themselves not in the sacrifice but in
[44:40] themselves amen
[44:42] that they were righteous
[44:44] this righteousness is not the
[44:46] righteousness of god it is their own
[44:48] righteousness on the religion and
[44:50] despise the other
[44:53] two men
[44:54] went up into the temple to pray
[44:58] so the temple
[45:00] amen
[45:02] was not just about sacrifice
[45:05] but the temple was a place
[45:08] of prayer
[45:11] by the robert guided

[45:15] amen
[45:17] the one a pharisee remember an actor
[45:21] and the other a publican so if you look
[45:24] clearly the pharisee is the religious
[45:27] one
[45:29] he looks very good on the outside
[45:32] and the publican
[45:34] you can send him to hell quickly
[45:38] that's a sinner
[45:40] amen you will call him enrique ricata
[45:43] and god taught by brandon be careful
[45:45] under that publican
[45:47] is a predestinated seed
[45:49] amen
[45:51] and the pharisees too the pharisees
[45:53] stood
[45:54] and prayed thus with himself this is the
[45:57] prayer of the pharisee god
[45:59] i thank you that i am not as other men
[46:03] how can you use a temple for something
[46:04] like this
[46:06] amen
[46:07] extortioner which is true the way unjust
[46:11] which is true there
[46:12] adulterer or even as this publican so
[46:16] according to the prayer of the pharisee
[46:20] he portrays himself as a very clean man
[46:25] a very righteous man
[46:29] everybody here but we will see when
[46:31] jesus will decode the pharisee
[46:34] amen
[46:35] verse 12

[46:55] i give tasks of all that i possess so
[46:58] i'm fulfilling all the requirement
[47:01] that the law

[47:15] he understands that he's a sinner
[47:18] and he has respect
[47:20] amen
[47:22] this one is coming boldly based on his
[47:24] righteousness
[47:26] amen
[47:28] standing far off will not lift up so
[47:30] much as his eyes to heaven
[47:34] but smote upon his breath saying god
[47:37] be merciful to me a sinner this one was
[47:42] a sinner and he understand that he is a
[47:45] sinner and he recognized himself as a
[47:48] sinner in the presence of god the other
[47:50] one see
[47:52] himself as a just man
[47:56] amen
[47:58] verse 14 i tell you
[48:00] this man the republican went down to his
[48:04] house
[48:04] justified so this justification of the
[48:08] publican
[48:09] amen
[48:10] happened where in the tabernacle in the
[48:12] temple it happened at the outer court
[48:16] anybody care
[48:18] so the other court your justification

[48:21] and he went down justified rather than
[48:24] the other for everyone that exalt
[48:27] himself shall be abased and he the
[48:29] humble himself shall be exalted humble

[49:10] and jesus went up to jerusalem where the
[49:13] temple was
[49:14] and found in the temple
[49:17] those that sold oxen and sheep and doves
[49:20] and the changers of money sitting
[49:24] and when he had made a scourge of small
[49:27] of small cord
[49:28] he drove them on
[49:30] out of the temple
[49:32] and the ship
[49:34] and the oxen and poured out the changers
[49:36] money and overthrew the tables and said
[49:40] to them that sold doves
[49:43] take these things from here
[49:45] make note my father's house
[49:48] which is the temple a house of
[49:51] merchandise

[49:55] remember that he was written the zeal of
[49:59] your house
[50:00] has eaten me up
[50:02] in another
[50:04] gospel
[50:05] jesus spoke that my house will be the
[50:08] house of prayer
[50:10] if you know your bible pretty good
[50:12] amen so the temple
[50:14] is not only a place but it's a house of
[50:17] prayer
[50:19] america
[50:21] let's pray heavenly father

[51:13] all right
[51:15] tonight we on the four phases of ruth
[51:18] alter
[51:20] slash
[51:21] prayer amen
[51:23] part one was grace part two tabernacle
[51:25] part three the brazen altar part four
[51:30] anybody remember
[51:33] part five that was last sunday
[51:37] the baptism part four was justification
[51:40] part five was the baptism and part six
[51:43] is the altar and prayer amen
[51:46] now we're still dealing a little bit
[51:48] with this brazen altar because it's very
[51:51] important
[51:52] when we talk about elijah
[51:55] in the book of first king
[51:57] we found out
[51:59] in first kings chapter 18 verse 29 and
[52:02] 30 the bible says that it came to pass
[52:06] when the midday was passed
[52:08] and they prophesied until the time of
[52:12] the offering of the evening
[52:14] sacrifice if you remember there is two
[52:17] sacrifices
[52:19] in the temple there was a morning
[52:21] sacrifice
[52:23] everybody
[52:24] and there was also an evening sacrifice
[52:28] and we found out that the story of
[52:30] elijah happened not according to the
[52:33] morning sacrifice but according to the
[52:36] evening sacrifice
[52:39] everybody here
[52:40] and the bible says that there was
[52:43] neither voice
[52:44] nor any to answer nor any di regarded
[52:48] because israel was between two opinions
[52:51] verse 30 and elijah say unto all the
[52:54] people come near unto me
[52:59] and all the people
[53:00] came near unto elijah amen
[53:04] before elijah repair the altar everybody
[53:09] the entire nation of israel have to move
[53:13] from their camp
[53:16] the camp of two opinion
[53:19] and get behind or close to elijah the
[53:22] prophet everybody clear
[53:25] but getting closer to elijah
[53:29] or getting on the side of elijah the
[53:31] prophet
[53:32] did not restore the heart of israel yet
[53:37] amen
[53:38] everybody okay so far
[53:40] i hope we on the same page amen so
[53:43] getting where elijah is physically
[53:46] because elijah called you does that
[53:49] restore you
[53:52] everybody here when everybody obey and
[53:55] came near to elijah then elijah opened
[53:59] the other court for them
[54:01] hey mark here and elijah started first
[54:05] with the altar the reparation of the
[54:08] altar amen because remember in the
[54:11] tabernacle that we are in the tabernacle
[54:14] have three places everybody care we have
[54:17] the other court here we have the holy
[54:19] place right here and we have the holiest
[54:22] right there amen and when you get to the
[54:24] other court the first thing that you see
[54:26] is what
[54:28] the brazen altar and the second one is
[54:31] water the lever amen and you see once
[54:34] israel got closer to elijah and mark
[54:38] here elijah open the door of the temple
[54:41] amen and begin first to restore
[54:45] to repair the altar
[54:47] everybody okay so far the altar that
[54:50] elijah was repairing was the altar in
[54:54] reference
[54:57] everybody here to the present altar
[55:01] in the temple
[55:03] anybody here
[55:05] this brazen altar in temple was only a
[55:09] copy or a replica of the brazen altar
[55:13] that was placed by moses
[55:16] everybody okay so far
[55:18] so the original faith
[55:22] the original foundation
[55:26] everybody here
[55:27] the foundation of the fathers
[55:30] were placed by moses
[55:34] everybody here everybody okay so when
[55:36] elijah repaired the altar elijah did not
[55:41] do it in the morning sacrifice but he
[55:44] was doing that at the evening sacrifice
[55:47] because he was returning the heart of
[55:50] israel
[55:51] back to the original foundation that was
[55:54] established by moses
[55:58] everybody okay so far
[56:00] everybody okay so far when jesus met the
[56:03] disciple on the road of the mass he
[56:06] started from moses
[56:09] everybody because moses was the one that
[56:12] duplicated the temple from heaven
[56:15] everybody okay
[56:16] so we found moses because there is three
[56:19] coming off jesus christ
[56:21] everybody okay
[56:22] [Laughter]
[56:24] hallelujah
[56:26] let me pull
[56:28] this and turn it there is three coming
[56:31] of jesus christ
[56:34] we have the first coming of jesus christ
[56:37] everybody okay
[56:38] then we have the second coming of jesus
[56:40] christ
[56:42] amen
[56:43] then we have the third coming of jesus
[56:45] christ amen
[56:47] the original foundation that was laid by
[56:51] the law because the scriptures say the
[56:53] laws came by moses
[56:56] but grace and truth came by jesus christ
[56:59] so moses started everything
[57:02] everybody
[57:04] but before the lamb of god jesus come
[57:08] we found somewhere here that the spirit
[57:11] of elijah came
[57:14] and he came by john the baptist
[57:18] [Music]
[57:19] everybody here let's go to luke chapter
[57:22] one
[57:24] blessed be the name of the lord
[57:26] hallelujah
[57:28] luke chapter 1
[57:30] [Music]
[57:31] if you dare you can say amen
[57:33] verse 13 but the angel said to him fear
[57:36] not zechariah for your prayer is heard
[57:39] and your wife elizabeth shall bear his
[57:41] son and you shall call his name who
[57:44] john drop down to verse 17
[57:47] and he shall go before him
[57:50] in the spirit and the power of who to
[57:54] turn the heart of the father to the
[57:56] water
[57:57] and that child was the lord jesus christ
[58:01] everybody so the father already deviated
[58:05] from the faith
[58:06] everybody okay everybody okay and then
[58:09] in order to restore the faith of the
[58:12] father
[58:13] back to the child
[58:15] john the baptist came under the
[58:18] anointing of elijah
[58:21] everybody okay
[58:22] but when john came
[58:24] and the people begin to come to john
[58:27] just like elijah did in the old
[58:29] testament
[58:31] john the baptist also opened the
[58:34] tabernacle
[58:38] everybody okay
[58:40] hallelujah
[58:42] let's go to luke chapter
[58:44] 3.
[58:47] oh my
[58:48] god luke chapter 3 amen
[58:52] verse 2. if you're there you can say
[58:53] amen
[58:55] and us and caiaphas being the high
[58:57] priest anas the word of the lord came to
[59:00] john the son of zechariah in the
[59:03] wilderness
[59:04] and he came into all the countries about
[59:07] jordan
[59:08] preaching water
[59:10] the baptism of water
[59:12] repentance for the remission of water so
[59:15] john was opening the tabernacle
[59:18] and presenting to israel
[59:21] repentance and be baptized
[59:24] repentance the present altar and be
[59:27] baptized into the level
[59:30] everybody okay
[59:31] even jesus christ himself have to go
[59:33] through the same process
[59:36] jesus christ didn't have to repent
[59:39] because jesus was the word made flesh
[59:42] but jesus had to be baptized in the
[59:45] level when john looked at him he said
[59:47] you know i am the one who's supposed to
[59:50] be baptized by you jesus said no no no
[59:52] no no he behooves to do what to fulfill
[59:55] all water
[59:57] that's why what a baptism it's essential
[1:00:00] it is important because you are
[1:00:02] fulfilling righteousness everybody okay
[1:00:04] and jesus also being baptized remember
[1:00:08] on sunday number one you gotta repent
[1:00:12] everybody okay number two you gotta be
[1:00:14] baptized
[1:00:15] everybody okay
[1:00:17] baptized number three we found there was
[1:00:20] a special time for water
[1:00:22] for prayer and number four what happened
[1:00:25] the holy ghost everybody okay we went
[1:00:28] through five examples on sunday in the
[1:00:31] scripture and demonstrated you this even
[1:00:34] jesus christ himself
[1:00:37] the first one who was sealed with the
[1:00:39] holy spirit you remember
[1:00:41] have to go through the same process
[1:00:44] except being
[1:00:45] except repentance because he was the
[1:00:48] lamb without blemish
[1:00:50] jesus said who can convince me of sin
[1:00:53] jesus was the sinless
[1:00:56] virtuous son of god he was god made
[1:01:00] flesh
[1:01:03] jesus was god
[1:01:05] everybody okay that's why he didn't have
[1:01:08] to repent
[1:01:09] but jesus had to be baptized
[1:01:12] but before the holy ghost come there is
[1:01:14] a space of prayer
[1:01:17] did it happen in the life of jesus too
[1:01:20] let's go to the look of book of luke

[1:03:57] sunset montana
[1:04:00] in colorado montana
[1:04:02] at the evening sacrifice
[1:04:04] because there will be light at the
[1:04:06] evening time

[1:04:19] after that introducing first coming
[1:04:22] after this introduction second coming
[1:04:25] and when jesus come the third time he's
[1:04:28] coming with his brother
[1:04:30] but in between this coming
[1:04:33] everybody here and the third coming we
[1:04:35] see again moses and elijah
[1:04:38] going back to the jews again
[1:04:42] moses elijah
[1:04:44] moses elijah and moses elijah because
[1:04:48] the pardon doesn't change
[1:04:50] jesus christ the same yesterday today
[1:04:54] and forever this message is perfectly in
[1:04:58] line with the scripture
[1:05:00] this message is jesus christ
[1:05:05] hallelujah
[1:05:06] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:05:10] my god
[1:05:12] everybody okay so far
[1:05:14] everybody okay so far so now you
[1:05:17] understand that an evening sacrifice
[1:05:20] here was done according to bringing
[1:05:23] israel back over there amen
[1:05:26] then we found out that elijah took water
[1:05:29] and poured on the altar
[1:05:31] amen
[1:05:32] but the water was in the level
[1:05:34] you remember so elijah took both the
[1:05:37] level
[1:05:38] and the altar and mix it together and
[1:05:41] brought to israel this is what you need
[1:05:43] to repair you amen and before the
[1:05:46] firefall elijah pray
[1:05:48] repent be baptized in the name of jesus
[1:05:51] christ and you shall receive the fire
[1:05:54] the gift of the holy spirit everybody
[1:05:56] clear so far so being closer to elijah
[1:05:59] is not enough
[1:06:02] being in the message camp is not enough
[1:06:05] you must go through the correct door
[1:06:08] of redemption
[1:06:10] you must meet jesus christ as a person
[1:06:13] or savior that died for you
[1:06:18] then you must be baptized at the level
[1:06:21] then you can move on with elijah
[1:06:24] everybody okay so far
[1:06:25] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:06:28] and then when we got in the tabernacle
[1:06:30] hallelujah we separated the tabernacle
[1:06:34] we found the other court have those two
[1:06:36] elements
[1:06:38] which is the other code then the holy
[1:06:40] place then the holiest you're not
[1:06:41] familiar with this amen
[1:06:44] we found that repent be baptized in the
[1:06:47] name of jesus christ then there is a
[1:06:49] space of time shall we speaking about
[1:06:52] the altar of the essence prayer
[1:06:54] receive the holy ghost everybody here
[1:06:56] barbara branham said justification
[1:06:58] sanctification baptism of the holy
[1:07:00] spirit

[1:07:03] roof serving
[1:07:05] roof water
[1:07:06] and then roof entering from the line of
[1:07:09] judah which is the door
[1:07:11] amen because judah was right here
[1:07:14] and then the priest followed the king
[1:07:16] and the priest was at the door which was
[1:07:19] speaking about melchizedek king and
[1:07:21] priest at the east gate

[1:07:51] the holy ghost you can understand here
[1:07:54] that this is a process
[1:07:58] or a journey
[1:08:00] because the trouble the people were
[1:08:03] taught that they received the holy ghost
[1:08:05] when they believe
[1:08:07] have you received the holy spirit says
[1:08:10] you believe
[1:08:11] since why because there is a process
[1:08:15] this may take time
[1:08:17] but if your heart is good
[1:08:19] all of them can be speeded up quickly
[1:08:22] we find paul receiving the holy spirit
[1:08:25] before the word of baptism
[1:08:29] but because we must fulfill our
[1:08:31] righteousness paul have to be
[1:08:32] re-baptized cornelius have to be
[1:08:35] re-baptized amen brother branham said he
[1:08:38] this he said now this is them true now
[1:08:42] in the next
[1:08:43] then the next thing is to do is then you
[1:08:46] are born again when you receive the holy
[1:08:49] ghost we went through this already that
[1:08:51] is when you are converted
[1:08:54] you might be in process
[1:08:57] of conversion anybody
[1:09:00] but you are not converted
[1:09:02] until it's completed and you are still
[1:09:05] into the kingdom of god peter when you
[1:09:07] are converted then you can strengthen
[1:09:10] your your your
[1:09:11] your your brethren amen but p they
[1:09:14] already have faith
[1:09:16] because jesus said i'm praying for your
[1:09:18] faith
[1:09:19] but that faith was not sanctioned yet
[1:09:21] that faith could whoever he could doubt
[1:09:24] jesus christ he could even curse
[1:09:28] wait until we get on sunday in the
[1:09:30] calvinist and roof
[1:09:33] everybody care and you will see because
[1:09:35] remember when you justify the snake is
[1:09:37] still there
[1:09:39] and right here
[1:09:40] hallelujah
[1:09:42] but obama said there is a vast
[1:09:44] difference
[1:09:45] between
[1:09:46] just a christian
[1:09:48] and a holy ghost fear christian
[1:09:52] the first place there is a christian
[1:09:55] professed to be christian
[1:09:57] but if this christian
[1:09:59] has not yet been filled with the holy
[1:10:02] ghost he's only in the process
[1:10:06] of being a water
[1:10:08] he is professed to believe it he's
[1:10:11] working to it but god has not yet given
[1:10:14] him the spirit
[1:10:15] of the holy ghost he's not yet to reach
[1:10:18] the goal
[1:10:19] with god that god has recognized it so
[1:10:23] the holy spirit is the final approval
[1:10:27] which is the goal
[1:10:29] and once you reach here then your
[1:10:32] destination is toward adoption
[1:10:35] everybody okay
[1:10:37] blessed be the name of the lord brother
[1:10:39] branham said one day
[1:10:41] they left aaron's road in there we found
[1:10:43] already we talked about aaron's road
[1:10:46] when they came back
[1:10:47] they come back the next year to pick it
[1:10:49] up he had blossom on it and it's already
[1:10:52] got life in it and had leaves on there
[1:10:54] and blossom on it and you take an old
[1:10:56] dead life
[1:10:58] and lay it in the holes
[1:11:02] ever here so you can never stay in the
[1:11:05] other court and have the fruit of the
[1:11:07] spirit
[1:11:09] you can impersonate
[1:11:12] the fruit of the spirit
[1:11:14] you cannot religiously like pharisees
[1:11:18] but the fruit we are talking about is
[1:11:20] not man-made fruit
[1:11:23] it is god produce fruit
[1:11:27] the tree never made fruit it's god
[1:11:30] that have an intimate relationship with
[1:11:33] the road of aaron because the road of
[1:11:36] aaron have the name of the high priest
[1:11:40] and a high priest is jesus christ when
[1:11:42] you are buried and you carry his name
[1:11:45] and you carry his name on you and you
[1:11:47] enter the hardest
[1:11:49] then it's a different story
[1:11:52] everybody okay so far
[1:11:53] brother branham say and let it come
[1:11:56] through the process
[1:11:58] of blood
[1:11:59] altar
[1:12:01] water liver
[1:12:03] and sanctification holy place and then
[1:12:06] go into the you see how you read brother
[1:12:09] branham
[1:12:10] you don't have the background you don't
[1:12:12] understand what brother branham is
[1:12:13] saying you like the utopian eunuch
[1:12:16] reading the prophet and do not
[1:12:18] understand it because he needed a
[1:12:21] fireform ministry
[1:12:23] to come and explain to him the prophet
[1:12:25] he shall blossom out
[1:12:27] if she is the honest woman
[1:12:30] there is in this city or the worst
[1:12:33] gambler that there is you shall hear him
[1:12:35] stand up on a breakfast some morning and
[1:12:38] give a testimony that shall shake the
[1:12:40] shingle
[1:12:41] off the top of the house here why is
[1:12:44] because that he come into fellowship
[1:12:47] that dead life has been renewed again
[1:12:50] amen
[1:12:51] brother branham continue he says as
[1:12:54] david do places
[1:12:55] well place it not long ago that god
[1:12:58] don't have any
[1:13:01] you remember
[1:13:02] check the door you enter in the message
[1:13:05] if you enter because of marriage because
[1:13:07] your parent because your friend
[1:13:09] something is wrong amen our pentecostal
[1:13:12] churches are bringing their young one
[1:13:15] placing them upon the seat and putting
[1:13:17] them members of the church they never
[1:13:20] came through the process
[1:13:22] of being born again no let's take the
[1:13:25] children take them to church it's good
[1:13:27] that will not
[1:13:29] get them where they're supposed to be
[1:13:30] those children need to meet god themself
[1:13:34] amen
[1:13:35] and fill with the holy ghost and upon
[1:13:37] their own
[1:13:38] we just take them into the church
[1:13:41] what have they got
[1:13:43] by bringing people only to the church a
[1:13:46] bunch of flat top haircuts
[1:13:48] rikki's
[1:13:49] run right on the street here just like
[1:13:51] the rest of the world women with bobbed
[1:13:54] hair wearing makeup and everything it's
[1:13:56] a disgrace trying to part turn after the
[1:13:59] world instead of going after the
[1:14:01] spiritual
[1:14:03] very important how people are getting
[1:14:05] into the message
[1:14:07] everybody clear
[1:14:08] brother branham said if you can smell
[1:14:12] if you get a whiff that god remains god
[1:14:14] if you get away from that heaven from
[1:14:17] heaven tonight that god keep his word
[1:14:20] and he is a miracle working god and you
[1:14:22] have not received the holy ghost yet
[1:14:24] smell the water
[1:14:26] the first thing he said do certainly
[1:14:30] repent
[1:14:31] again
[1:14:32] from the water
[1:14:35] the breast and altar is a very sacred
[1:14:38] altar
[1:14:40] and playing on the brazen altar this is
[1:14:43] where billy graham
[1:14:45] and everybody else
[1:14:47] fail
[1:14:48] when your repentance must be sincere
[1:14:53] everybody here
[1:14:55] and lay yourself
[1:14:57] as a sacrifice on the altar with shelter
[1:15:01] president and you will be consumed off
[1:15:05] of the world and born again of the
[1:15:07] spirit and be baptized in the name of
[1:15:09] jesus christ he shall fill you with them
[1:15:13] now you understand sometimes he's mixing
[1:15:16] word
[1:15:17] born again here then he say fear with
[1:15:19] the holy spirit
[1:15:20] you need to understand now amen
[1:15:23] go through the right process again a
[1:15:26] process
[1:15:27] not come shake hand with the preacher
[1:15:29] and put your name on the book but die so
[1:15:32] dead
[1:15:34] that you don't know the word no more
[1:15:36] brother branham is not mixed up it's the
[1:15:39] word he uses sometimes 7
[1:15:42] 700. you need to keep the thought
[1:15:44] correct everybody here
[1:15:47] if you notice here brother branham said
[1:15:49] you must come
[1:15:52] and repent from the bottom of your heart
[1:15:56] go to galatians chapter 3
[1:16:02] the breast and altar
[1:16:04] need to be clearly
[1:16:07] clearly
[1:16:10] painted to the people
[1:16:13] in other words clearly demonstrated to
[1:16:16] the people
[1:16:18] because it's the beginning of everything
[1:16:21] if you miss that
[1:16:23] you waste your time in the message
[1:16:29] everybody here
[1:16:30] you're going to stay 20
[1:16:32] 10 years five years no holy ghost
[1:16:35] because the beginning was wrong
[1:16:38] let's go to galatians chapter three
[1:16:40] verse one

[1:17:56] the galatians to keep that image
[1:18:02] here
[1:18:02] paul
[1:18:03] demonstrated to them clearly the present

[1:20:45] galatian
[1:20:47] it is the cross
[1:20:49] that opened the way it is the cross that
[1:20:52] rented the veil of the temple so that

[1:23:23] woe to you lord help me
[1:23:26] okay word to you
[1:23:28] blind god
[1:23:30] which say
[1:23:31] whosoever shall swear by the what by the
[1:23:34] temple it is nothing
[1:23:37] but whosoever shall swear
[1:23:39] by the gold of the temple is air
[1:23:46] when they were building
[1:23:48] the temple
[1:23:50] and the furniture of the temple
[1:23:52] some of those furniture was overlaid by
[1:23:55] gold gold gold gold gold gold
[1:23:58] to the point that you cannot separate
[1:24:01] the gold
[1:24:02] from the
[1:24:03] temple
[1:24:05] the pharisee came
[1:24:08] the religious one
[1:24:10] and begin to bring separation
[1:24:13] between the temple
[1:24:15] and the gold of the temple
[1:24:18] everybody here and they say okay if you
[1:24:21] swear by the old by the temple there is
[1:24:23] no problem to her the problem is the
[1:24:25] gold of the altar now the people begin
[1:24:28] to get confused so now what do we give
[1:24:31] importance is it the gold of the altar
[1:24:33] of the temple or is it the temple
[1:24:36] everybody care because the brazen altar
[1:24:39] must be clearly demonstrated
[1:24:42] you cannot bring confusion at the
[1:24:45] present altar
[1:24:49] am i reading a different bible you ready
[1:24:51] let's drop down lunch into the deep you
[1:24:54] there
[1:24:55] you fools
[1:24:57] again
[1:24:59] blind
[1:25:00] for weather is greater the god
[1:25:04] or the temple that the water
[1:25:07] so the temple was the one sanctifying
[1:25:10] the gold
[1:25:13] ever here but the pharisees took the
[1:25:15] people away from the temple no one there
[1:25:18] later on they can sell anything in the
[1:25:20] temple
[1:25:20] [Music]
[1:25:22] because the sacredness of the temple is
[1:25:25] no longer there
[1:25:27] this just dropped from heaven brother
[1:25:29] robert
[1:25:30] are you there
[1:25:32] take verse 18.
[1:25:33] you ready now watch this keep your
[1:25:36] seatbelt and whosoever shall swear by
[1:25:38] the water oh my god brother kelly which
[1:25:42] although is that one
[1:25:44] we are the brazen altar
[1:25:47] whosoever
[1:25:48] remember paul say you don't play with
[1:25:51] the brazen altar
[1:25:52] look how the pharisee brought confusion
[1:25:55] at the brazen altar
[1:25:57] whosoever shall swear by the altar
[1:26:01] is nothing in other words the altar is
[1:26:04] no more important
[1:26:08] what the author brother branham said
[1:26:10] brass represent divine judgment where
[1:26:12] the price was paid which was speaking of
[1:26:14] cavalry somebody believe the cavalry
[1:26:20] everybody here
[1:26:21] everybody here
[1:26:23] and whosoever but whosoever swear by the
[1:26:26] weapon
[1:26:31] do i have a space here
[1:26:32] oh yes
[1:26:35] thank you jesus
[1:26:37] i'm gonna build my altar
[1:26:40] this is the altar
[1:26:42] and this is
[1:26:44] hopefully
[1:26:45] it's an animal
[1:26:47] whatever you can
[1:26:50] we have an animal on the altar the beast
[1:26:52] the sacrifice
[1:26:54] this is the gift
[1:26:57] this is the sacrifice
[1:26:59] and this is the altar
[1:27:02] ever here
[1:27:03] now the pharisees say you swear by this
[1:27:07] it's nothing
[1:27:08] if you swear by this one
[1:27:11] this is the most important thing
[1:27:15] everybody okay
[1:27:16] everybody okay okay
[1:27:21] verse 19 you fools
[1:27:24] and blind
[1:27:25] for weather is greater
[1:27:28] the gift
[1:27:30] or the altar that sanctifies the gift
[1:27:36] everybody okay so far everybody okay so
[1:27:38] far
[1:27:40] the gift
[1:27:41] when it's outside the tabernacle it is a
[1:27:45] normal animal
[1:27:46] amen
[1:27:49] everybody okay
[1:27:50] but when the gift touches the altar
[1:27:55] that gift changed
[1:27:57] he became a sacred animal
[1:27:59] that only the priest can eat
[1:28:01] [Music]
[1:28:04] nobody else can eat it anymore
[1:28:06] everybody okay so far
[1:28:08] now jesus is asking which one is big it
[1:28:12] was the altar that was sanctifying the
[1:28:15] gift
[1:28:17] are you there
[1:28:19] you read this before a long time now you
[1:28:21] see why he's imported
[1:28:23] amen
[1:28:24] verse 20
[1:28:26] who so therefore shall swear by the
[1:28:29] water
[1:28:31] swear by it
[1:28:32] the altar and by water
[1:28:36] so when you are jesus correct them that
[1:28:40] when you are swearing about the altar
[1:28:43] you're not just swearing about the altar
[1:28:46] you're swearing about the entire thing
[1:28:50] in other words the altar
[1:28:54] and the gifts are won
[1:28:58] and they cannot be separated
[1:29:01] amen
[1:29:03] did you get that
[1:29:04] brother mikey then we watch this again
[1:29:08] whose show shall swear by the temple
[1:29:12] swear by it
[1:29:13] verse 21 and by him thou do whatever
[1:29:18] so that temple was not only the building
[1:29:21] but when god dwell in that temple the
[1:29:24] temple became like god
[1:29:27] when god dwelled in jesus christ the man
[1:29:30] jesus christ became god
[1:29:36] everybody here 100
[1:29:39] human 100 percent divine
[1:29:44] ever here
[1:29:46] and he does swear by the help by heaven
[1:29:49] swear by water
[1:29:52] everybody here the throne of god and by
[1:29:55] him the water so when you swearing by
[1:29:57] heaven you cannot separate heaven from
[1:30:00] god
[1:30:03] [Music]
[1:30:05] what are you trying to say
[1:30:07] everybody here
[1:30:08] what are you trying to say
[1:30:10] you ready
[1:30:11] this altar
[1:30:13] is a
[1:30:15] author
[1:30:17] that doesn't change
[1:30:22] keep your seat belt
[1:30:24] you okay
[1:30:26] what changes
[1:30:28] is the sacrifice
[1:30:30] on top of the altar
[1:30:35] everybody here
[1:30:36] everybody okay
[1:30:38] anybody here
[1:30:40] did you get it
[1:30:42] did you get it this altar has been a
[1:30:46] foundation that was placed
[1:30:49] by moses
[1:30:51] and solomon kept it
[1:30:53] because he was made after the altar that
[1:30:57] was in heaven
[1:30:58] where the seraphim which are the the
[1:31:01] delivered of heaven were working over
[1:31:04] there remembers they are sick
[1:31:06] here
[1:31:07] it was the original foundation
[1:31:12] it does not change
[1:31:14] what changes is the gift
[1:31:18] or the sacrifice
[1:31:20] everybody here and the sacrifice was
[1:31:24] changing
[1:31:27] constantly
[1:31:31] everybody clear so far everybody
[1:31:35] this altar doesn't change
[1:31:38] but the word
[1:31:41] made flesh
[1:31:43] bleeding sacrifice
[1:31:46] was changing
[1:31:48] upon the same altar
[1:31:55] are you okay
[1:31:56] are you okay
[1:31:58] this altar is like your bible
[1:32:06] [Music]
[1:32:08] it remains the original foundation
[1:32:12] he remained the absolute
[1:32:16] american
[1:32:17] but the sacrifice or the message of the
[1:32:21] messenger
[1:32:22] might change
[1:32:24] [Music]
[1:32:27] are you there
[1:32:28] but you cannot separate the messenger
[1:32:32] the message and the bible
[1:32:35] because the message and the bible are
[1:32:37] one
[1:32:40] what vindicated the message is the
[1:32:43] foundation upon which the message stands
[1:32:47] the message came from the bible
[1:32:50] the message is vindicated by the bible
[1:32:54] that's why the message is right
[1:32:57] you cannot bring a discussion between
[1:33:00] the message and the bible
[1:33:02] you are bringing confusion between the
[1:33:06] altar
[1:33:07] and the gift that is on the altar the
[1:33:10] altar and the gifts are the same
[1:33:12] and the gifts have been vindicated by
[1:33:15] the bible
[1:33:25] in this church
[1:33:26] we don't know argue what is right the
[1:33:29] message of the bible
[1:33:31] the foundation remains the bible
[1:33:34] but the absolute interpretation of the
[1:33:37] bible is the message of the hour you
[1:33:40] cannot separate the two
[1:33:43] you cannot say the message is right and
[1:33:46] you begin to reject the bible this is
[1:33:49] pharisee
[1:33:51] the message came from heaven
[1:33:54] it was an open book which was the bible
[1:33:58] the message was the bible within the
[1:34:00] bible
[1:34:02] [Applause]
[1:34:06] it is the bible that vindicated the
[1:34:10] message of the hour the bible said
[1:34:13] brother branham said the bible said
[1:34:16] brother branham said the message
[1:34:18] is perfectly in line with the bible
[1:34:22] you cannot separate the two
[1:34:24] you cannot put one above the other there
[1:34:28] two are one
[1:34:30] when you swear by one you swearing by
[1:34:33] the other when you believe the bible you
[1:34:36] must believe the message of the hour
[1:34:39] and when you reject the message of the
[1:34:41] hour you reject the bible
[1:34:44] this message is perfectly lined with the
[1:34:47] scripture blessed be the name of the
[1:34:49] lord
[1:34:50] hallelujah
[1:34:57] [Applause]
[1:35:01] this thing
[1:35:03] have to be clearly expressed
[1:35:07] not bringing confusion
[1:35:09] hallelujah
[1:35:11] hallelujah
[1:35:12] hallelujah blessed be the name of the
[1:35:15] lord
[1:35:21] hallelujah
[1:35:22] let's drop
[1:35:26] brother kelly i don't know what to do my
[1:35:29] time is running up
[1:35:32] go to verse one
[1:35:34] i thought i can finish this so i get on
[1:35:36] luther
[1:35:38] i can say amen
[1:35:40] hallelujah
[1:35:47] whoever deliberately stay home
[1:35:50] my god it's milky here
[1:35:55] i wish i knew
[1:35:58] amen
[1:36:01] matthew 23 then spoke jesus to the
[1:36:04] mountain
[1:36:04] and to his disciples saying the who
[1:36:08] and who
[1:36:10] who went into the temple
[1:36:14] everybody okay
[1:36:15] the scrub and the pharisee
[1:36:18] sit on moses seat
[1:36:22] they know they caught
[1:36:25] they know the quote very well
[1:36:27] brother branham said brother branham say
[1:36:29] they know it
[1:36:30] they sit on moses seed on the prophet
[1:36:32] seeks
[1:36:33] everybody here but what the problem
[1:36:35] oh therefore whatsoever they bid you
[1:36:39] to observe
[1:36:41] and do
[1:36:43] to observe that observe and do
[1:36:48] if they give you a coat
[1:36:51] regardless whether they are hypocrite or
[1:36:54] not
[1:36:56] you just take the coat
[1:36:59] but don't take them
[1:37:03] you follow me
[1:37:05] if you said the judge shall leave by
[1:37:07] faith and it's a baptist who said that i
[1:37:09] will say amen
[1:37:11] i'm saying amen to the world
[1:37:13] but not to the baptist
[1:37:18] as long as brother branham said pick up
[1:37:21] what brother branham say
[1:37:22] but the problem is your interpretation
[1:37:25] ever here
[1:37:27] he said observe and do but do not
[1:37:31] you
[1:37:32] after the water
[1:37:33] in other words there is a discrepancy
[1:37:36] between their preaching and their lives
[1:37:42] they preach a certain way but they live
[1:37:44] a different way and if you look at the
[1:37:47] life and the sermon you're going to be
[1:37:49] shocked
[1:37:50] and it may it can cause you to stumble
[1:37:55] remember gifts and calling out without
[1:37:57] repentance pick up what they say
[1:38:00] but don't pay attention too much in
[1:38:02] their lives
[1:38:03] everybody okay so far
[1:38:06] he says
[1:38:07] for they say
[1:38:09] and they do not
[1:38:12] oh my god everybody okay
[1:38:15] for they burn the heavy burden
[1:38:18] and grief used to be born and lay them
[1:38:20] on men's shoulder
[1:38:22] but thems they themselves will not move
[1:38:25] with them
[1:38:26] uh with one of their fingers
[1:38:31] they tell you to do stuff they cannot do
[1:38:32] themselves
[1:38:34] but all the work
[1:38:36] they do for it to be seen of men
[1:38:41] all they do is for popularity
[1:38:44] they make brought their philatel and
[1:38:47] enlarge the borders of their gunman and
[1:38:50] love the upper mushroom
[1:38:52] at the feast
[1:38:58] i will teach you these young people you
[1:38:59] go to a feast
[1:39:01] i will show you where to sit
[1:39:05] ever here
[1:39:06] and the chiefs sit in the synagogue and
[1:39:09] breeding in the market and to be called
[1:39:11] of men who rubber rubber jump to verse
[1:39:14] 14
[1:39:15] wow unto you scrub
[1:39:18] and pharisee hypocrite i thought this
[1:39:22] man say that he was a good man
[1:39:29] for you devoured with those houses
[1:39:32] i thought they were clean
[1:39:35] and for the protest make long prayer
[1:39:39] therefore you shall receive the greater
[1:39:41] condemnation everybody
[1:39:44] let me skip down job to verse 25 what do
[1:39:47] you scrub and pharisee hypocrite for you
[1:39:50] may clean the outside of the cup
[1:39:54] and the blood but within they are full
[1:39:56] of water
[1:39:58] and water
[1:40:00] unclean on the inside so in the
[1:40:02] macroscope of god both of them are
[1:40:05] sinners
[1:40:08] one is a conscious sinner
[1:40:11] a humble the other one is an arrogant
[1:40:14] sinner
[1:40:19] because paul found himself like this
[1:40:23] paul said that i am the pharisee of
[1:40:25] pharisee remember that and paul said
[1:40:27] that i realized that i was the chief
[1:40:30] sinner
[1:40:35] everybody okay
[1:40:36] let me try to see if i can skip some of
[1:40:38] them
[1:40:40] verse 28 even so
[1:40:43] even even so you also outwardly appear
[1:40:47] righteous to men
[1:40:49] but within you are full of water
[1:40:53] and water
[1:40:55] that's what was up there
[1:40:57] so his prayer doesn't have sincerity
[1:41:03] that's why he went home the same way he
[1:41:05] came in and probably worse than that
[1:41:08] what are you trying to say
[1:41:10] brother branham say
[1:41:12] that is even becoming the pentecost
[1:41:15] in the churches he be coming into the
[1:41:17] pentecostal realm that they are always
[1:41:19] promising something that they never get
[1:41:21] to it
[1:41:23] it's always that every fellow has a
[1:41:25] different sensation make it whether it's
[1:41:27] scriptural or not and they are promising
[1:41:30] something that they never do get to it
[1:41:32] unless it seems like it's got to a place
[1:41:35] where there doesn't seem to be any
[1:41:37] sincerity
[1:41:39] the people don't get down to that real
[1:41:43] kernel of sincerity
[1:41:45] the very word is lost the very word
[1:41:49] sincerity has lost its value to the
[1:41:51] people
[1:41:52] or by the people's way of living it's
[1:41:55] lost its sincerity to them now they
[1:41:57] don't seem to understand even our
[1:42:00] confession
[1:42:01] very important because the brazen author
[1:42:04] will open the way all the way there
[1:42:06] remember roof nobody told her to glean
[1:42:09] she was the one automatically going to
[1:42:11] clean and god directed her foot to the
[1:42:14] field of boys it happened based on roof
[1:42:17] deciding
[1:42:18] a genuine decision
[1:42:21] a genuine confession i think one of the
[1:42:24] things that keep our people from being
[1:42:27] here is lack of confession come on
[1:42:31] is the lack of sincere confession
[1:42:35] everybody okay
[1:42:36] what i'm saying but looking at my wife
[1:42:39] sitting here if i would go out here
[1:42:41] today and throw my arm around some other
[1:42:44] woman and make love to her and i know
[1:42:46] then after i did that that i was wrong
[1:42:49] it's an example
[1:42:51] now of course my comforter will keep me
[1:42:53] from doing that
[1:42:55] that's why you need the holy ghost you
[1:42:56] keep falling falling falling falling
[1:42:58] it's a problem no holy ghost
[1:43:00] everybody
[1:43:01] but i mean
[1:43:02] if i did if it happened that i did it or
[1:43:05] anything similar to it and then i know
[1:43:08] the first thing is to say to my wife
[1:43:10] before i can say to god forgive me
[1:43:12] because i sin against her what brother
[1:43:15] branham is saying here is when you
[1:43:17] commit adultery before you even go to
[1:43:20] god go back to your partner or your
[1:43:22] spouse
[1:43:24] brother branham say supposingly it
[1:43:26] happened
[1:43:27] what happened
[1:43:29] if you come to the altar and remember
[1:43:32] you have ought you go make that right
[1:43:34] first
[1:43:35] remember that was in jesus when you go
[1:43:38] to the hotel with your gift which alter
[1:43:41] was it
[1:43:42] the brazen altar when you remember that
[1:43:45] you and your neighbor don't get along
[1:43:47] stop don't go to that altar it's a
[1:43:50] serious altar
[1:43:51] go back correct before you continue
[1:43:54] if not you're going to come back like a
[1:43:55] pharisee
[1:43:56] but here
[1:43:57] go make a right first before you offer
[1:43:59] your gift so i've got to go to her i
[1:44:02] believe in confession he's straightening
[1:44:05] up also it is not true confession unless
[1:44:08] it is
[1:44:10] confession you gotta make things right
[1:44:12] the correct way that's why not doing
[1:44:15] this correctly here block you from the
[1:44:18] holy ghost
[1:44:20] brother branham says what if i said now
[1:44:24] i'm going to confess it
[1:44:26] that i done wrong and i say good lord
[1:44:29] oh friend of mine you know that i know
[1:44:32] you real well praise god hallelujah i
[1:44:35] think you are a good old fellow forgive
[1:44:37] me you know old fellow i didn't mean it
[1:44:39] that way see now you say that is
[1:44:41] sacrilegious it is to make a confession
[1:44:44] like that
[1:44:46] in other words when you're going to
[1:44:47] repent
[1:44:48] you don't play game
[1:44:52] you don't commit adultery and you're
[1:44:55] coming back to your wife telling your
[1:44:57] wife oh hallelujah praise the lord my
[1:44:59] wife i love you where is the alleluia
[1:45:01] coming from
[1:45:05] that hallelujah is coming from hell
[1:45:08] [Music]
[1:45:09] did you hear me you must not come
[1:45:12] playing games
[1:45:14] brother branham said it is sacrilegious
[1:45:18] how are you doing i'm sorry i was
[1:45:20] kidding
[1:45:22] you were kidding
[1:45:23] repenting no you need to stop and say
[1:45:26] sister i am sorry i treated you bad
[1:45:30] what i did is wrong i am sorry without
[1:45:33] even laughing
[1:45:35] [Music]
[1:45:39] hallelujah
[1:45:40] but what if i go and say lord i didn't
[1:45:43] mean to do it just that way and you help
[1:45:46] me and won't do it again he shall refuse
[1:45:48] my sacrifice until i first go and make
[1:45:52] that right with my wife
[1:45:56] then what if i come to her to my wife
[1:45:58] with the same irreverence and say say oh
[1:46:02] girl oh friend of mine oh mother of my
[1:46:05] children oh sweetheart you know we have
[1:46:08] been all charmed for a long time say
[1:46:10] what uh if i put my arm around another
[1:46:13] woman and what do you say about it oh
[1:46:15] kid would you forgive me in other words
[1:46:17] you're coming to your wife he said let
[1:46:18] me ask you a question what about if one
[1:46:20] day you hear that i fall with a woman
[1:46:22] are you gonna forgive me
[1:46:27] brother branham say i imagine how she'll
[1:46:30] look your wife will give you a look
[1:46:33] where are you coming from
[1:46:35] amen
[1:46:36] she would think what has happened to my
[1:46:38] husband now the first thing she would
[1:46:41] not know whether i was kidding or
[1:46:43] whether i was not
[1:46:45] and you don't go that way to make a
[1:46:47] confession to your
[1:46:50] or to whom
[1:46:55] oh hallelujah good to see you brother i
[1:46:57] was just trying to tell you i'm sorry
[1:46:58] for what i did the other day okay okay
[1:47:04] hallelujah
[1:47:06] you go with the depth of sincerity
[1:47:09] with water
[1:47:12] it's not laughing
[1:47:14] godly sorrow of your sin first you must
[1:47:16] be water
[1:47:18] i must tell her sweetheart come here
[1:47:21] it may mean the rest of our married life
[1:47:24] the woman that i live with that is my
[1:47:26] sweetheart and how i love you all this
[1:47:29] year but now you may leave me from this
[1:47:31] on you may not stay with me you may not
[1:47:34] accept me and i'm knowing that but yet
[1:47:37] to make it right i've got to make it
[1:47:39] right in other words when you sit down
[1:47:40] you say listen
[1:47:42] if you have to leave me i understand
[1:47:44] that you have the right to do it so
[1:47:45] because what i did i did wrong i'm
[1:47:48] asking you forgiveness if you want to
[1:47:49] leave you can leave but i gather correct
[1:47:52] my life with god because jesus is coming
[1:47:56] that's the way you confess
[1:47:59] hallelujah brother branham say then i
[1:48:02] got to tell god the same way
[1:48:04] and tell both her and god with the
[1:48:08] sincerity that i shall never do it again
[1:48:11] by the grace of god
[1:48:13] maybe my speech to her would convince
[1:48:16] her but my speech won't convince god
[1:48:19] you can manipulate your conversion
[1:48:22] you can sit down and make people feel
[1:48:25] like you understand i didn't mean that i
[1:48:27] was i was i was just to understand
[1:48:29] understand you are manipulating human
[1:48:31] being but you will not manipulate god
[1:48:34] because god is seeing your heart that
[1:48:36] you don't want to make it right you're a
[1:48:38] hypocrite
[1:48:41] amen and after all just a few more years
[1:48:44] with her if god permits i shall be taken
[1:48:46] out of the world what about if you die
[1:48:48] after two days
[1:48:50] you were trying to protect a marriage
[1:48:51] now you're dead you're going to hell
[1:48:54] but with god it's eternity so i must be
[1:48:57] deeply sincere with god in other words i
[1:49:00] rather lose my marriage and be right
[1:49:03] with god than trying to protect my
[1:49:06] marriage and the hypocrisy
[1:49:09] and lose heaven because heaven will be
[1:49:12] eternity
[1:49:14] everybody but if i'm not sincere there
[1:49:16] is no need of me wasting who
[1:49:22] you're going to fast 10 days you're
[1:49:24] wasting your time god's time listening
[1:49:26] to me and that is where he comes to
[1:49:28] today amongst people that doesn't seem
[1:49:31] to have the depth of sincerity that they
[1:49:33] ought to have where
[1:49:35] sincerity at the brazen author amen
[1:49:38] let me move on to this and get to
[1:49:40] somewhere amen
[1:49:43] when we talk on sunday
[1:49:45] we mentioned about cornelius
[1:49:48] brother branham says this
[1:49:53] i need this still
[1:49:55] okay praise god brother branham says
[1:49:58] this
[1:49:59] blessed be the name of the lord brother
[1:50:02] branham said that i believe
[1:50:04] the same condition
[1:50:06] was with those hearts at the house of
[1:50:09] cornelius when they had received the
[1:50:11] word of god
[1:50:12] amen
[1:50:14] with gladness
[1:50:16] and the holy spirit is that word quicken
[1:50:19] and he has been quickened to them that
[1:50:22] is the reason the holy ghost begin to
[1:50:23] speak out in other tongue and prophesy
[1:50:27] it's about cornelius it was the
[1:50:29] receptacle heart of the people that the
[1:50:32] word fell into it seeing all the
[1:50:35] supernatural
[1:50:37] this is the key
[1:50:38] while
[1:50:40] he yet spread this word the holy ghost
[1:50:42] fell then peter said can we forbid water
[1:50:45] you remember on sunday sing that this
[1:50:47] received the holy ghost like we did i
[1:50:50] believe the sin were already gone
[1:50:53] for the holy spirit would not have come
[1:50:55] in
[1:50:56] but abraham is saying that the sin of
[1:50:58] cornelius was already gone even even the
[1:51:01] sin of his friend everybody that
[1:51:04] received the holy ghost they were
[1:51:05] already been forgiven they already have
[1:51:07] faith
[1:51:09] if not the holy ghost will not sanction
[1:51:11] it
[1:51:11] did brother brother give you the
[1:51:13] scripture
[1:51:14] let's go to acts chapter 10.
[1:51:18] let me hurry up quickly now
[1:51:22] i still have my minute let's go to act
[1:51:24] chapter 10.
[1:51:27] if you dare you can say amen
[1:51:29] act 10 verse 9
[1:51:32] cornelius had his vision when he
[1:51:34] finished having his vision
[1:51:36] praise the lord god also went his vision
[1:51:40] told him to go call peter
[1:51:42] the angel told him to go get a peter and
[1:51:44] on the other hand peter was at home
[1:51:48] hungry
[1:51:48] trying to do something and suddenly
[1:51:51] something happened to peter
[1:51:52] verse
[1:51:53] nine on the morrow as they went on their
[1:51:56] way they were going to get peter and
[1:51:58] junar to the city
[1:52:00] peter went up to the housetop
[1:52:03] to do water
[1:52:05] but robert
[1:52:06] to pray at what time
[1:52:09] altar and prayer
[1:52:11] peter went to pray and what time
[1:52:15] the sixth hour
[1:52:17] the six hours
[1:52:19] is called this is jewish language
[1:52:24] in the gentile language
[1:52:27] it is 12
[1:52:28] p.m what you call noon
[1:52:32] i'm going slowly now
[1:52:35] maybe
[1:52:37] and he began and he became very hungry
[1:52:41] and would have eaten but while they made
[1:52:44] ready he fell into a trance and saw
[1:52:46] heaven open and a certain vessel
[1:52:48] descending to him as he had been a great
[1:52:52] knit at the four corners and let
[1:52:54] down to the earth
[1:52:56] when we were all manner of four-footed
[1:52:58] beasts of the earth and wild beast verse
[1:53:01] 12 and grief and creeping things and
[1:53:03] falls off the air
[1:53:05] and there came a voice to him rise peter
[1:53:08] kill and do what
[1:53:09] but peter say not so lord for i have
[1:53:12] never eaten anything that is common or
[1:53:14] what
[1:53:15] god was showing him what he knew by the
[1:53:17] law was unclean
[1:53:21] everybody
[1:53:22] unclean and the voice spoke to him again
[1:53:25] the second time
[1:53:27] what god has
[1:53:30] that you call not you what
[1:53:33] so god was giving peter the vision
[1:53:36] because he knew he's gonna send peter
[1:53:38] for the first time to the gentile and
[1:53:40] peter explained down the road that there
[1:53:43] was no way a jew can have fellowship
[1:53:45] with the gentiles so god show him that
[1:53:48] those people i'm sending you to are
[1:53:50] already clean
[1:53:52] don't call them unclean that's why when
[1:53:55] they were preaching the gospel when they
[1:53:57] preached the gospel automatically the
[1:53:59] holy ghost fell down because their
[1:54:01] vessels were already declared clean
[1:54:06] everybody okay
[1:54:07] go back to verse one now
[1:54:10] this is where we're getting
[1:54:11] the present altar in prayer amen
[1:54:15] you there there was a certain man in
[1:54:18] caesarea called cornelius a centurion a
[1:54:21] gentile of the band called the italian
[1:54:23] man a devout man and one that feared god
[1:54:27] with all his house which gave much arm
[1:54:29] to the people and prayed to god how
[1:54:33] this is a believer
[1:54:34] amen watch
[1:54:37] he saw in a vision
[1:54:39] evidently about the water
[1:54:43] cornelius
[1:54:45] was praying
[1:54:47] amen
[1:54:48] and he saw a vision
[1:54:50] and the vision was at what time
[1:54:54] the ninth hour
[1:54:55] the ninth hour
[1:54:57] in the gentile language
[1:55:00] it's 3 p.m
[1:55:04] everybody okay
[1:55:06] and ninth hour of the day an angel of
[1:55:09] god coming to him saying to him
[1:55:11] cornelius

[1:55:16] 55
[1:55:18] i want you to understand well the
[1:55:20] president is not a gamer
[1:55:24] in some brazen altar entrance you come
[1:55:27] with sincerity you don't play gamer
[1:55:30] in psalm 55 17
[1:55:33] david says this
[1:55:35] that evening
[1:55:40] morning and water
[1:55:43] so we have the morning
[1:55:47] number one number two the noon
[1:55:51] everybody okay
[1:55:52] and number three the what
[1:55:54] the evening
[1:55:57] ever
[1:55:58] here this noon we know it's what the six
[1:56:02] hours
[1:56:04] back here
[1:56:05] the evening we have what
[1:56:08] the ninth hour
[1:56:10] what is the morning
[1:56:12] so david said morning evening and noon
[1:56:16] we'll pray
[1:56:17] and cry out loud
[1:56:20] and he shall hear my voice
[1:56:22] according to david
[1:56:24] brother david
[1:56:26] these three spots brother robert
[1:56:29] are the time of prayer
[1:56:35] the prayer and the presidential
[1:56:38] brother kelly ready he gets yummy now
[1:56:42] you want to go home
[1:56:44] okay
[1:56:46] daniel 6 verse 10 now when daniel knew
[1:56:49] that the writing was signed they told
[1:56:52] him nobody can pray here for one month
[1:56:54] to any other god
[1:56:57] he went into his house
[1:56:59] and his window being opened
[1:57:02] in his chamber toward water
[1:57:05] why was he doing that
[1:57:08] he was doing that in reference to the
[1:57:11] prayer of solomon at the present altar
[1:57:16] solomon at the president
[1:57:18] pray god and say if anybody is elsewhere
[1:57:22] in trouble if they turn around
[1:57:25] towards jerusalem
[1:57:27] where the president is
[1:57:29] healed their prayer
[1:57:32] even jonah at the belly of the
[1:57:35] well
[1:57:36] had to get a compass
[1:57:39] a gps
[1:57:42] to direct himself in the deep of the
[1:57:44] ocean
[1:57:46] throughout jerusalem
[1:57:48] once your prayer goes toward jerusalem
[1:57:52] automatically god hears
[1:57:54] what was in jerusalem where was solomon
[1:57:57] praying solomon was praying at the
[1:57:59] present altar
[1:58:01] praise and altar and prayer
[1:58:05] we okay now hallelujah and then he
[1:58:08] nailed upon his knee what was solomon
[1:58:11] doing
[1:58:13] upon his knee how many times
[1:58:16] so daniel was praying three times
[1:58:20] david said he prayed how many times
[1:58:24] david was worshipping praising god
[1:58:30] seven times
[1:58:32] you need a scripture you see me
[1:58:35] but he was praying
[1:58:37] three times
[1:58:38] three and seven
[1:58:40] the mathematics

[1:58:47] three times a day
[1:58:49] and pray and get thanked to his god as
[1:58:52] he did a full time so there was
[1:58:54] something about
[1:58:55] daniel that every day
[1:58:58] morning
[1:58:59] noon
[1:59:00] evening prayer and david said morning

[2:11:23] anybody here
[2:11:25] why does the pharisee and the disciple
[2:11:27] of john fast by your disciple jesus are
[2:11:30] not fasting and jesus said unto them can
[2:11:33] the children of the bride chamber moon
[2:11:36] as long as the bridegroom is with them
[2:11:38] but the day will come when the
[2:11:40] bridegroom shall be taken from them and
[2:11:42] they shall then water when i've been
[2:11:44] going out they can start fasting but how
[2:11:47] many times do jews fast
[2:11:49] remember the pharisee
[2:11:51] he said i fast how many times
[2:11:54] which days
[2:11:57] that's what somebody says
[2:11:59] i need to go by my prophet
[2:12:02] everybody here
[2:12:03] brother branham i have been fasting
[2:12:07] and was just like tonight fridays is the
[2:12:10] first day
[2:12:12] has been for me for a long time
[2:12:15] [Music]
[2:12:17] where did you learn this william marion
[2:12:19] branham
[2:12:20] usually fridays is a first day for me i
[2:12:24] don't eat on some time when
[2:12:27] and what
[2:12:29] where did brother branham learn that
[2:12:34] this message
[2:12:35] is more than what you think
[2:12:37] amen till sometime indeed
[2:12:41] that is not a regular fast that is just
[2:12:44] a couple of days a week to fast remember
[2:12:46] the pharisee the jews were doing that so
[2:12:49] he pulled the fasting from the jews and
[2:12:52] he pulled the hours of prayer from the
[2:12:53] jews
[2:12:57] but here the pharisee was praying before
[2:13:00] and the other court at the president he
[2:13:02] said first twice a day
[2:13:04] ever here
[2:13:06] so i along first come more days when the
[2:13:10] lord put it on you
[2:13:11] you don't put it yourself but that is
[2:13:13] just in respect and honor of god's great
[2:13:16] memorial to us the fasting a command and
[2:13:20] so after three o'clock
[2:13:25] three p.m evening time
[2:13:27] ninth hour usually i have a little
[2:13:30] something
[2:13:33] all of this
[2:13:34] locked up over there in the mystery of
[2:13:37] the level
[2:13:38] here that's why the eunuch
[2:13:42] he came to worship in jerusalem you
[2:13:44] remember
[2:13:45] he was worshipping under the old law
[2:13:48] every year and the lord opened his bible
[2:13:51] and then he fell on isaiah
[2:13:54] when isaiah was talking about the
[2:13:56] crucifixion of jesus christ
[2:13:59] so the lord pulled him to the brazen
[2:14:01] altar
[2:14:02] but he didn't understand the meaning of
[2:14:04] the brazen altar so when philip came
[2:14:06] philip opened the brazen altar and began
[2:14:09] to tell him that the man that was dying
[2:14:11] there is jesus christ in other words
[2:14:13] philip was pulling him through the
[2:14:15] president when he got him hooked at the
[2:14:18] brazen altar quickly the man saw the
[2:14:21] lever automatically
[2:14:23] he said do you see water what hindered
[2:14:26] me to be you just presented to me the
[2:14:28] level i already seen the level why can't
[2:14:31] that look
[2:14:32] you already presented to me the
[2:14:34] president
[2:14:35] now i see that's the messiah jesus
[2:14:38] christ is the president
[2:14:40] but what follow next is water look at
[2:14:42] water over there philip say wait a
[2:14:44] minute before i put you in the water let
[2:14:47] me hear your confession he said i
[2:14:49] believe that jesus christ is the son of
[2:14:51] god philip say stop the chariot
[2:14:54] me and you let's go to the level and
[2:14:56] then from there on god take over your
[2:14:58] life
[2:14:59] begin good at the present altar watch
[2:15:02] where you came how you enter in the
[2:15:03] message
[2:15:05] did you enter because you were born in a
[2:15:07] message were you following your friend
[2:15:09] where you following somebody
[2:15:11] check if your entrance is good because
[2:15:14] that entrance is the beginning that's
[2:15:16] going to unlock the remaining of the
[2:15:17] staff
[2:15:18] if it's correct
[2:15:20] the president and the prayer life is
[2:15:22] going to open everything else remember
[2:15:25] you'll be repent
[2:15:26] being baptized and
[2:15:28] prayer
[2:15:32] let's stand
[2:15:40] i went over 15 minutes
[2:15:45] and i left some other stuff again
[2:15:49] amen
[2:15:50] even paul they have to pull paul from
[2:15:53] the old atonement
[2:15:55] until paul understands that the jehovah
[2:15:58] is jesus christ and paul changed his
[2:16:01] disposition toward jesus he said lord
[2:16:03] what do you want me now to do now since
[2:16:06] you accepted the atonement if you go in
[2:16:09] the book of acts 10 you will see
[2:16:11] cornelius when peter come came there
[2:16:13] peter begin to preach to them jesus
[2:16:15] christ crucify i can read it to you go
[2:16:18] to act 10. what was peter doing peter
[2:16:21] say okay the lord called you for me to
[2:16:24] help you okay the way we started we
[2:16:26] always start with the president peter
[2:16:28] pulled the brazen altar and said do you
[2:16:30] remember what happened in jerusalem do
[2:16:32] you remember what the chief priests did
[2:16:34] they crucified the masterpiece that was
[2:16:35] again bringing the brazen author and as
[2:16:38] they bring the president god said these
[2:16:40] already understood this they already
[2:16:42] passed the holy ghost drop
[2:16:44] when the holy ghost dropped peter say
[2:16:46] wait a minute they already got
[2:16:47] uh at the finishing line but i didn't
[2:16:49] see them baptized he fulfilled come back
[2:16:52] and get baptized again
[2:16:54] then they fulfill the tabernacle
[2:16:57] the other court the holy place and the
[2:16:59] holiest the tabernacle is fulfilled you
[2:17:01] go into adoption
[2:17:04] let's pray heavenly father
[2:17:06] lord we thank you again father for your
[2:17:08] grace for your love your mercy and for
[2:17:11] everything you have been doing for us
[2:17:14] father
[2:17:16] we cannot over emphasize
[2:17:19] the need of calvary
[2:17:20] to the believer lord
[2:17:22] calvary means a lot
[2:17:25] and means everything to us to take the
[2:17:28] dear lamb of god to accept to be spit on
[2:17:32] to accept to be stripped completely
[2:17:34] naked
[2:17:35] something that none of us here will
[2:17:37] accept but father you took it all the
[2:17:39] way and all the ordinances just like you
[2:17:42] did for roof that was against her father
[2:17:45] you nail everything at the cross
[2:17:48] and you want us to always start at the
[2:17:50] cross at the cross at the cross further
[2:17:54] that's the starting point
[2:17:56] and once a decision is made clear
[2:17:59] with sincerity
[2:18:01] with a true deep lord father confession
[2:18:04] it will unlock everything because from
[2:18:06] there on we are born under the lineage
[2:18:08] of melchizedek and you take over the
[2:18:11] shipload until you bring it ashore
[2:18:14] lord
[2:18:15] we keep going over this
[2:18:17] and emphasizing on this
[2:18:19] because the new birth is a very
[2:18:21] important and crucial element now that
[2:18:24] you see we see all the signs falling all
[2:18:26] around the world father we know that the
[2:18:28] coming of the lord is very very very
[2:18:31] very close lord and father we want to
[2:18:34] make sure to examine ourself whether we
[2:18:37] are in the faith
[2:18:38] how did we get in this message do we
[2:18:41] remember day that we stood at the
[2:18:42] present altar and give our life to jesus
[2:18:45] christ
[2:18:46] and students had a personal experience
[2:18:48] with jesus christ
[2:18:50] that is beyond mama beyond our families
[2:18:54] beyond religion beyond following a
[2:18:57] friend or following somebody or beyond
[2:19:00] coming into the message because you want
[2:19:01] to get married but it goes beyond that
[2:19:04] until an anchor get into the soul and we
[2:19:08] know that from this point on if my
[2:19:10] father leave the message i stay with it
[2:19:13] if my husband leave the message just
[2:19:15] stay with him if my wife leave if my if
[2:19:18] whoever can leave the message this
[2:19:20] message now means life to me because i
[2:19:23] met the author of this message i met
[2:19:26] jesus christ at the present altar and my
[2:19:29] life now is in order father help this
[2:19:31] congregation and help also those that
[2:19:34] can stream lord father if you direct
