[30:31] and not by the head
[30:32] everybody clear and it shall bruise your
[30:35] head that is christ
[30:37] and you shall bruise his heel so
[30:41] the position of the serpent
[30:44] or the position of the devil right here
[30:48] is an attacker
[30:51] that is directed to the hill
[30:54] not to the head amen when you look at
[30:57] christ the crust is aiming for the head
[31:00] but the serpent is aiming for the hill

[31:20] light you're not more no more heaviness
[31:24] attached to you genesis chapter 25

[31:42] verse 26 and after that
[31:45] came his brother out this is jacob
[31:49] and his hand took hold on esau's
[31:53] here everybody here so by
[31:57] birth jacob is a mess remember
[32:00] last on sunday we stopped at jacob
[32:03] you might be seated so by birth
[32:06] by birth jacob is a mess
[32:09] because jacob is holding the heel of
[32:12] esau

[32:17] but that's where that's the position of
[32:19] jacob at birth
[32:21] by birth it's a mess everybody clear
[32:26] and his hand took hold of eso's heel
[32:29] and his name was called jacob which
[32:32] means water
[32:33] is a planter or a deceiver
[32:36] a man by birth he's born in a mess
[32:40] he's born a deceiver by birth
[32:44] there's nothing he can do he can't help
[32:46] it
[32:47] a deceiver by birth anybody clear
[32:52] and isaac was three score years old
[32:56] when she bore them everybody clear go to
[32:59] genesis 27
[33:07] everybody there genesis chapter 27 verse
[33:11] 36
[33:12] i can speak this but i want you to see
[33:15] it yourself
[33:17] hallelujah
[33:21] everybody there let's go to verse 35
[33:25] and he said your brother came with
[33:27] subtility
[33:29] amen if you go back in genesis 3
[33:33] you're going to see that that word
[33:34] subtility was first
[33:36] used on the beast in eden
[33:40] because the bible said that there was a
[33:41] beast there the serpent was a very sad
[33:44] beast
[33:45] amen and there is a meaning to that
[33:49] so now esau is qualifying jacob
[33:52] that he used the same tactic
[33:57] why because when he was born he was
[34:00] holding the hill
[34:01] of who of his soul the position of the
[34:04] devil
[34:05] anybody clear verse 36
[34:09] and he said is not his name
[34:13] is not he rightly named jacob in other
[34:16] words
[34:16] the name really fits his character
[34:19] that's the reason why they call him
[34:21] jacob
[34:21] amen because his life is proving
[34:25] the meaning of the word jacob anybody
[34:28] here
[34:29] for he had supplanted me in other words
[34:32] he have deceived me
[34:33] he have taken my place by deception he
[34:36] has supplanted me
[34:38] these two times he took away my birth
[34:41] heart
[34:42] and behold now he has taken away my
[34:45] blessing
[34:46] and he said have you not reserved a
[34:49] blessing for me
[34:50] is so never understood that the
[34:52] birthright is connected
[34:54] it's a combo with the blessing once you
[34:57] lose the birthright
[34:58] automatically the the the blessing that
[35:02] is connected to the birthright is gone
[35:04] amen he thought he can keep the blessing
[35:07] and reject the birth right that's what
[35:10] the people that
[35:11] approach christ trying to do they want
[35:13] the blessing of christ
[35:15] they want christ to bless them but they
[35:18] want nothing to do with the death white
[35:20] they don't want to do anything with
[35:22] their birth
[35:24] they don't want to change their birth
[35:26] they don't want to have a breath right
[35:28] everything they want is just blessing
[35:30] blessing
[35:31] blessing blessing but that birthright is
[35:34] connected
[35:35] to the blessing everybody clear so far
[35:38] let's go to genesis chapter 32
[35:40] blessed be the name of the lord
[35:43] hallelujah brother david give me a
[35:45] little bit
[35:46] the devil has been struggling with my
[35:48] voice
[35:49] it's not corona
[35:55] but i refuse to take medication
[36:00] genesis 32 verse 24 if you dare you can
[36:03] say amen
[36:05] and jacob was left alone this is a
[36:08] personal
[36:09] experience amen nobody with you
[36:14] you must be left alone with god
[36:18] you and the lord yourself nobody there
[36:22] everybody else not his wife who are not
[36:25] there his concubine were not there
[36:27] his children were not there it was jacob
[36:30] and the angel alone amen
[36:34] praise be the name of the lord and the
[36:37] wrestler a man with him
[36:39] until the breaking of the day water
[36:43] wrestling not just one minute prayer
[36:46] not just two pray pray pray pray until
[36:49] the break of the day
[36:51] amen and when he saw that he prevailed
[36:55] not against him so somebody was really
[36:57] desperate
[36:58] he touched the hollow of his tie
[37:01] and the hollow of jacob's tie was out of
[37:04] joint
[37:05] as he wrestled with him in other words
[37:07] they put a mark on him
[37:09] amen we saw it on sunday verse 26
[37:13] and he said let me go for the day breaks
[37:17] and he said i will not let you go except
[37:20] you do what you bless me he was already
[37:23] blessed
[37:24] still looking for blessings amen had
[37:27] vision in his life suffering all along
[37:30] but it was just one thing he lacked if
[37:33] he had started
[37:35] by meeting the angel first amen
[37:38] his life could have been more a big
[37:42] difference than where he was he started
[37:45] by looking for the blessing firstly
[37:48] then the angel came later you start
[37:51] first
[37:51] seek first the kingdom of god anybody
[37:55] clear
[37:56] first the kingdom of god then everything
[37:58] else will be
[38:00] added unto you amen he went for the
[38:03] blessing first
[38:04] and he left the man thing
[38:08] that's why he was suffering and he was
[38:11] working with his intelligence
[38:13] cheating cheating cheating and being
[38:16] pushed by the gene of the family
[38:18] anybody clear verse 27 they never bless
[38:21] him
[38:22] and he said to him what is your name
[38:24] that's your problem
[38:26] your name your character
[38:30] amen what is your name amen you want a
[38:33] blessing you're already blessed
[38:35] but what is your problem what is your
[38:37] name
[38:38] what is that nature anybody clear
[38:41] and he said jacob be not a word i'm a
[38:44] liar
[38:46] in other words i'm a deceiver i'm a
[38:48] supplanter
[38:50] amen remember when you deal with the
[38:53] lord
[38:53] especially in the form of the angel of
[38:56] the lord amen
[38:57] there is a discernment going on it's
[39:00] just like
[39:01] jesus and the woman at the well when
[39:03] they begin to discuss
[39:04] jesus look and say go get your husband
[39:07] amen
[39:08] he knows exactly what you need in your
[39:10] life
[39:11] to get you somewhere for jacob there is
[39:14] a problem with your birth
[39:15] that birth in the birth you were
[39:18] attached to the position of the devil
[39:21] and they give you your name based on
[39:24] your birth
[39:25] so we gotta change that breath then
[39:29] everything else will change in your life
[39:31] everybody clear verse 28
[39:34] and he said your name shall be called
[39:37] normal
[39:39] not that you're gonna use it another
[39:41] time no more
[39:42] this is the end of him this is the end
[39:45] of the name of jacob
[39:47] this is the end of the life of the man
[39:49] called jacob
[39:51] no more jacob batwater
[39:55] israel for as a priest
[39:58] have you power with god amen
[40:01] you are now associated with god and with
[40:04] men
[40:05] and have what prevail ever clear
[40:08] blessed be the name of the lord let's go
[40:10] to hosea then we're going to pray
[40:14] so in genesis 3 the position of the
[40:17] devil
[40:18] the hill when we move forward the birth
[40:22] of
[40:22] jacob birthing a mess coming into the
[40:25] world with a wrong nature
[40:27] a man a deceiver
[40:31] supplanter subtility
[40:34] then he got a contact with the angel
[40:37] according to
[40:38] genesis chapter 32 all we know
[40:42] is jacob asked for the blessings right
[40:46] now let's see how hosea described
[40:49] the same sin hosea chapter 12.
[40:52] if you dare you can say amen hosea
[40:56] chapter 12
[40:57] verse 3 hallelujah
[41:01] you're there anybody looking at their
[41:04] bible
[41:06] he took his brother by water by the hill
[41:10] in the womb he started from birth
[41:13] from those chin right there and by his
[41:16] strength
[41:17] he had power with god yea
[41:20] he had power over the angel and
[41:23] prevailed
[41:25] he did water
[41:28] did genesis tell you that
[41:31] so when jacob was with the angel
[41:35] he was not just struggling
[41:39] our mind we always have a fight going on
[41:42] between jacob and the angel
[41:44] now hosea is giving you more detail
[41:47] remember god give a revelation he
[41:50] doesn't change it but he had
[41:52] more information to help you receive it
[41:55] better
[41:56] amen now we found out that during this
[41:58] fight
[41:59] one person was weeping not the angel
[42:03] amen he wept and made what
[42:08] supplication to him so this is a
[42:11] different
[42:11] fight where somebody's bleeding he's
[42:14] weeping he's he's making supplication
[42:18] in other words he has been begging for
[42:20] redemption
[42:22] i'm in a mess i did everything i can
[42:26] i work all my life i have been cheated
[42:29] 10 times
[42:30] with my salary i suffer in my family
[42:33] i suffer with my brother-in-law i suffer
[42:36] with my
[42:37] father-in-law i suffer with my children
[42:39] i
[42:40] suffer with difficulty having children
[42:42] amen
[42:43] now i'm hating i'm i'm in a point where
[42:47] i must
[42:48] meet esau and i don't want to continue
[42:51] in this way
[42:53] i'm weeping i'm crying for redemption
[42:59] amen yeah he had power over the angel
[43:02] and prevailed he wept and made
[43:05] supplication to him
[43:06] he found him in better and there he
[43:09] spoke with us
[43:10] everybody clear let's pray heavenly

[43:27] we grieve the holy spirit
[43:29] in our heart in our ways in our thinking
[43:32] lord

[43:52] of the lord father fill this place lord
[43:55] bring your blessings even to those that
[43:58] are streaming lord
[43:59] father may the devil in his army be
[44:01] completely sealed out lord
[44:03] but may you speak tonight lord move me
[44:05] completely out of the way
[44:07] in the name of jesus christ amen
[44:11] god bless you we are continuing with
[44:13] king hazary's three fists and esther
[44:16] to banquet a week prior to this
[44:20] we spoke about three elements that
[44:22] affected
[44:23] our our lives we spoke about smoking
[44:27] about clear we spoke about drinking
[44:30] and also we spoke about women amen on
[44:34] sunday we added again three elements
[44:36] that happened to us by birth
[44:38] amen by birth we have the zodiac sign in
[44:43] our life
[44:44] america we have our birthplace
[44:49] or the territory the place of your birth
[44:51] your nation
[44:52] everybody clear everybody clear
[44:56] amen blessed be the name of the lord and
[44:59] the third one we have
[45:00] our gene from our family amen
[45:04] the gene that comes from our father and
[45:07] our mother
[45:07] just like we saw a gift coming in the
[45:10] life of timothy
[45:11] from his grandmother mother all the way
[45:13] down amen
[45:14] so when we are born we are born in a
[45:17] mess
[45:18] just like jacob everybody clear praise
[45:21] be the name of the lord
[45:22] let me move on right here we started
[45:25] with
[45:26] birth and we found out by birth the
[45:29] place
[45:29] of the nation that we are born heavily
[45:31] influenced on us
[45:33] we found out that our family trees have
[45:35] an influence on us
[45:36] and our son of the zodiac have also
[45:40] an influence on us i was asked a
[45:43] question
[45:44] by a young man on sunday after preaching
[45:47] about the zodiac
[45:48] he was worrying about his zodiac and i
[45:51] told him i said you don't have to worry
[45:53] about the zodiac
[45:54] you don't have to go on the internet and
[45:56] try to figure it out
[45:57] what you can do and what you cannot do
[46:00] amen
[46:01] you don't have to measure into the devil
[46:03] territory amen
[46:05] all you need to do is worry about christ
[46:08] amen
[46:09] once you get your relationship with
[46:11] jesus christ
[46:12] automatically the bad side of your
[46:15] zodiac will be cleaned up amen
[46:18] you can learn about your weakness and
[46:20] many of us already learn about those
[46:22] weakness
[46:23] we know we get a high temper we know we
[46:26] get our attitude
[46:27] we know we get all kind of stuff that we
[46:29] have and despite
[46:31] the fact that we know about them yet we
[46:34] cannot
[46:34] overcome them amen brother branham said
[46:37] that boy was trying to overcome them
[46:40] intellectually but he could not amen
[46:44] jacob tried the same thing and jacob
[46:47] could not
[46:47] amen he first lied to his father amen
[46:51] and got the blessing he also went to
[46:54] lebanon and cheated lebanon
[46:56] and got rich by cheating amen but
[46:58] despite
[46:59] that his life never changed because
[47:02] jacob
[47:03] needed a breath everybody clear
[47:06] blessed be the name of the lord under
[47:08] the seal
[47:09] brother branham said jacob had the
[47:11] birthright is that right
[47:14] but he sure was a letter shasta with him
[47:17] see
[47:18] he went down and deceived his daddy
[47:21] he deceived his brother he done
[47:23] everything
[47:24] amen but yet legally right down
[47:28] he headed because esau had sought out in
[47:32] other words
[47:32] he so saw that the birthright legally it
[47:35] belonged to jacob
[47:37] he also need to get the blessing amen
[47:40] but the main key that we are preaching
[47:42] we are trying to point here amen is
[47:45] before you get married first you must be
[47:49] first married with christ amen
[47:53] because if you are not married with
[47:55] christ
[47:56] if you don't meet the angel of the lord
[47:59] yourself
[48:00] if you don't contact the pillar of fire
[48:02] yourself
[48:03] you're gonna fight your own life like
[48:06] jacob
[48:07] you're gonna be working with your own
[48:09] strength
[48:10] until god comes and makes you weak
[48:14] so that he god can become stronger
[48:16] because when we are weak then who is
[48:18] stronger
[48:20] amen blessed be the name of the lord but
[48:23] then when he goes down
[48:25] there to work for his father-in-law he
[48:28] put
[48:28] those proper stick in the water cheating
[48:31] he make those
[48:32] pregnant kettle
[48:35] and cuddle and things bring forth
[48:37] speckled calves
[48:39] iron oh you know everything he done like
[48:42] that
[48:43] just to gain water money now watch now
[48:47] he was asked from his people now it's a
[48:50] top of the jews now
[48:52] he is a money snatcher because it's in
[48:56] the dream
[48:57] of the jews amen abraham lied
[49:00] as a clyde jacob lied the patriarch lied
[49:04] even joseph lied amen
[49:08] that's why jesus told uh to the
[49:12] nicodemus you must be born again
[49:15] as long as you are not born again you
[49:17] will be controlled
[49:19] by the spirit of your nation by the
[49:22] the gene of your family and you're going
[49:24] to be controlled by the bad side of your
[49:27] zodiac
[49:28] because by birth you are born wrong
[49:31] anybody here shaping iniquity coming
[49:33] into the word speaking life
[49:35] i don't care how he gets him he sure
[49:38] gets it talking about the bathroom
[49:40] he is talking about the money he shall
[49:43] skin you alive
[49:44] to get him now you know that he is a
[49:47] little shasta
[49:48] that's all but don't deal with him he
[49:51] shall get you bull in other words
[49:53] don't deal with a jew a jew will snatch
[49:56] money out of you
[49:58] he can't help her because it's in the
[50:00] chin
[50:01] ever clear yes sir why he's got to be
[50:05] that that is the kind of spirit that is
[50:08] water
[50:09] he can't just help it he's just going by
[50:12] what he have everybody clear
[50:14] then on sunday we stop where jacob
[50:17] had a fight and met the angel everybody
[50:19] clear
[50:20] now before he goes back and met the
[50:24] angel of the lord
[50:25] the bible says and brother branham
[50:27] explained to us
[50:28] that jacob was leaving for a long time
[50:31] with lebanon
[50:32] and then suddenly he began to long to go
[50:35] back home
[50:36] to go back to the promised land brother
[50:38] branham said jacob
[50:40] longing in his heart everything seems to
[50:44] be wrong
[50:45] everything he try is not working his
[50:47] life has been in a mess
[50:49] sometimes you get a little experience
[50:51] like jacob you have a vision
[50:53] something happened and tomorrow you flip
[50:56] and you move on
[50:57] and you flip and you move on and you
[50:59] flip it seems like
[51:00] something is wrong somewhere everybody
[51:02] clear
[51:03] he wanted to go back home the holy
[51:07] spirit was leading him
[51:09] so that longing of the heart of jacob
[51:12] was not a personal longing but it was a
[51:16] time
[51:17] that god began to move in his life
[51:20] in order to bring him deliverance for
[51:23] something that he
[51:24] suffered all along blessed be the name
[51:27] of the lord
[51:28] he had made a promise to god he had to
[51:31] go to battle
[51:32] to pay this time and so forth you
[51:36] already got that one corrected
[51:37] and and here when i saw it i was like
[51:41] my god right family and here on his road
[51:45] back
[51:46] he found out that eso his enemy brother
[51:49] was just across the river waiting for
[51:52] him with an army
[51:53] so jacob was a coward yet he had the
[51:57] blessings of god
[51:58] god had promised to bless him he had the
[52:01] bear fright
[52:02] amen but branham continues here
[52:05] it was jacob who had deceived his
[52:08] brother
[52:09] and lived luxuriously down with his
[52:12] father-in-law
[52:13] with camels and sheep and everything one
[52:16] time
[52:16] they come a yearning to go back home
[52:19] go back to water go back to water
[52:23] to the right thing again he went
[52:26] away from home from a long time and that
[52:30] desire
[52:31] that dust that is hidden in your heart
[52:33] that begin to pull you back to god
[52:36] that is not you that is the holy spirit
[52:39] leaving you
[52:40] because the bible said no one can come
[52:43] unto me
[52:44] except the father jersey so you are not
[52:48] the one searching for god
[52:50] it is god actually searching for you
[52:54] hallelujah blessed be the name of the
[52:57] lord
[52:58] you are christian and if god had not
[53:01] elected you to be a christian
[53:03] you will not be a christian amen
[53:06] it is god's choice whether you like it
[53:10] or not
[53:11] when it's time to go home god will push
[53:14] you to his program
[53:15] amen not yours no man seek god
[53:20] no man seek god at any time you have not
[53:23] sought god
[53:24] but god has sought you just like adam
[53:27] adam
[53:28] we are down amen the one who fell was
[53:31] adam
[53:32] adam was hiding but god was chasing adam
[53:36] amen he was not you calling for god
[53:41] hallelujah it was god calling for you
[53:45] and then when god called you he showed
[53:48] he
[53:49] he elected you you accepted the call
[53:52] he was what justification amen
[53:56] when you receive the call of god
[54:00] coming like a yearning in your heart it
[54:03] is a sign
[54:04] that you are elected hallelujah
[54:07] then you gave your heart to christ
[54:10] and was filled with the holy spirit and
[54:13] now you are positionally placed in the
[54:15] body
[54:16] of christ ever clear so that yearning of
[54:20] jacob was just to bring him to a place
[54:22] of deliverance
[54:24] jacob had a possession that he must
[54:27] go back home but he knowed he had to
[54:30] face his enemy
[54:31] he didn't know how he was going to do it
[54:34] what
[54:35] what did he do first he stayed there
[54:39] until he got a hold of who
[54:43] god and when he was convinced that he
[54:46] had the blessing
[54:47] because god said so then he was
[54:50] concerned first
[54:52] he must stay until he knows something
[54:55] happened
[54:56] he had a what a mark
[55:00] in his physical being that showed
[55:03] that god had placed it upon
[55:07] him so number one before you get married
[55:12] you must make sure you have a mark of
[55:15] christ
[55:16] in your life everybody clear
[55:19] this mark is important because it will

[55:32] alone amen nobody was there
[55:36] but what the angel did to jacob
[55:39] could be seen publicly amen
[55:42] even if you are not with jacob there
[55:45] but if you look at the way jacob is
[55:47] walking
[55:48] it is actually reflecting his experience
[55:52] with the angel the experience was first
[55:55] alone
[55:56] it was first private amen but the
[55:59] manifestation of that experience is
[56:02] gonna be
[56:02] public amen everybody could look at
[56:05] jacob
[56:06] and say something is different with that

[1:32:24] full order file order will be
[1:32:27] taken away from you when you walk into
[1:32:30] the presence of someone
[1:32:31] with body orders or something another
[1:32:34] perfume is to take that order away
[1:32:37] so that you in the presence of that
[1:32:39] person
[1:32:40] that you might not be found it's
[1:32:42] unbearable
[1:32:43] that is what perfume soap has order in

[1:32:50] and whatever
[1:32:51] that is what they use it for amen
[1:32:54] praise the name of the lord now notice a
[1:32:56] man i just feel good
[1:32:58] he was the rose of sharon he was
[1:33:02] offered to god as a sweet smelling water
[1:33:05] remember the song of solomon is talking
[1:33:07] about the server
[1:33:09] of the master everybody and then when he

[1:33:51] to get a perfume it has to be water
[1:33:54] and then they crush it and squeeze the
[1:33:56] perfume water

[1:38:39] that have not have sex yet

[1:38:52] amen they love him amen
[1:38:57] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:39:00] why do the virgin love him
[1:39:04] why take first corinthians chapter seven
[1:39:08] keep the song of solomon keep your
[1:39:11] finger
[1:39:12] there or uh your pen there

[1:39:39] overflowing so you must leave the
[1:39:42] stretch overflowing
[1:39:47] it just dropped so i just release it
[1:39:50] amen
[1:39:52] the bible says that his name is a good
[1:39:54] name

[1:40:02] word
[1:40:02] be born amen and the virgin love him
[1:40:06] why do the virgin love him first
[1:40:09] corinthians chapter seven
[1:40:11] i believe most of you read this chapter
[1:40:13] over and over as we gave you readings
[1:40:15] let's jump to verse 25 you there
[1:40:19] now concerning what everybody clear
[1:40:23] concerning virgins i have no commandment
[1:40:27] of the lord
[1:40:28] yet i give my judgment as one that has
[1:40:31] obtained mercy of the lord to be
[1:40:33] faithful there is a key there amen
[1:40:38] because paul was a steward and his two
[1:40:41] words have to be faithful
[1:40:42] if you want to know that it's in first
[1:40:44] corinthians 4 verse 1 and 2. you will
[1:40:47] see that
[1:40:48] amen verse 26 i suppose therefore
[1:40:52] that is good for the present distress i
[1:40:55] say
[1:40:55] that it is good for a man so to be in
[1:40:58] other words paul is saying that
[1:41:02] i want young people
[1:41:05] to remain single that is what paul is
[1:41:08] saying
[1:41:09] he say i want young virgin to remain
[1:41:11] virgin
[1:41:13] why paul why
[1:41:17] you ready don't worry you want to get
[1:41:19] married
[1:41:21] okay amen verse 27
[1:41:26] verse 27 are you born to a wife
[1:41:30] sick not to be loosed are you loosed
[1:41:33] from a wife sick not a wife but
[1:41:36] if you marry you have not sinned if you
[1:41:39] decided
[1:41:39] i'm burning i gotta get married no
[1:41:41] problem there's no sin with
[1:41:42] it amen and if a virgin mary
[1:41:47] she has not seen nevertheless such a
[1:41:50] have
[1:41:51] trouble in the what but i do what
[1:41:55] in other words you're gonna break into a
[1:41:58] different channel by beginning to have
[1:42:01] relaxed sexual relationship in the
[1:42:03] marriage
[1:42:04] and it's a troubling area remember we
[1:42:07] already dealt with it
[1:42:09] now if you stay away with it paul is
[1:42:11] saying that you'll be better
[1:42:13] but the devil is the one telling you
[1:42:15] you're missing
[1:42:16] but if you marry you didn't do anything
[1:42:18] wrong we're balancing it
[1:42:21] okay let's go
[1:42:24] to jump to verse 33 32 you there
[1:42:29] but i would have you
[1:42:32] without carefulness that's my concern
[1:42:36] he that is a married
[1:42:39] you see that why do the virgin love him
[1:42:42] he that is
[1:42:43] a married care for the things that
[1:42:45] belong to what
[1:42:48] do you see that so young people if you
[1:42:51] are not
[1:42:52] married your first focus will be what
[1:42:55] christ
[1:42:57] are you there because that is your
[1:43:00] husband
[1:43:01] until you he provides you a space for
[1:43:04] the effort
[1:43:05] amen if you don't get married you still
[1:43:08] have a companion for life
[1:43:10] the best one that will never disappoint
[1:43:13] you
[1:43:13] they will never leave you they will
[1:43:15] never forsake you
[1:43:17] they will be there with you all the way
[1:43:19] to the end
[1:43:20] he's better than your husband he's
[1:43:22] better than your wife
[1:43:24] he's better than your mother mama can
[1:43:27] forget you
[1:43:28] peppa can forget you but me the lord i
[1:43:31] will never
[1:43:32] forget you that's why the virgin
[1:43:36] those that are not married the single
[1:43:39] love him
[1:43:41] the single love him the single are
[1:43:43] connected with him the single
[1:43:45] are in relationship with him
[1:43:49] amen so when you get in marriage he is
[1:43:52] always the preeminence
[1:43:53] even if you're my husband you're not
[1:43:55] going to tell me to steal
[1:43:57] because i have the lord
[1:44:00] i have a quote for it amen
[1:44:04] but that would help you with that
[1:44:06] carefulness paul is saying i'm trying to
[1:44:09] help you stay in your relationship with
[1:44:11] god without destruction
[1:44:13] amen that's what paul is saying he that
[1:44:16] is a married
[1:44:18] cares for the things that belongs to the
[1:44:19] lord how he may please who
[1:44:22] because that's that's your husband
[1:44:24] that's your marriage you're trying to
[1:44:26] please god
[1:44:27] amen verse uh

[1:44:33] between a water a wife and a water
[1:44:37] and a virgin i'm reading the scripture
[1:44:40] why do the virgin

[1:45:01] you understand now job to verse uh with
[1:45:04] them there is a difference also
[1:45:06] between the wife and the virgin the
