[0:08] and see if that
[0:09] happens I've got it wrote down here the
[0:12] very day we the Lord let me see that
[0:14] 1933 and here it is just exactly where
[0:17] it where it said just coming the same
[0:19] way how the pope would leave Rome and so
[0:21] forth now there are good people but
[0:24] mistaken Joseph and Mary was fine people
[0:28] but real mistaken but what was it God
[0:30] used a 12year old boy to show that that
[0:33] word has to stay pure exactly what it
[0:37] was what it said the first place he was
[0:39] virgin born and that's what he
[0:42] was thinking he was with them when they
[0:44] joined the churches and St but it wasn't
[0:47] now but to the elected now that's a
[0:51] darkness and I can stay on that for
[0:52] another hour but to the elected precious
[0:56] and called saints of God I say to you
[0:59] this coming year Shalom God's
[1:03] peace our is here I could have been back
[1:07] there before the days that the world was
[1:09] created and looked down and seen the
[1:11] whole thing and the father had said to
[1:12] me what day would you want to live I
[1:14] said now right now amen this is the hour
[1:18] this is the greatest hour that the
[1:19] church has ever moved into just before
[1:22] the coming of the bridegroom all the
[1:24] real Church of the Living God ought to
[1:26] be on fire burning with the light of the
[1:28] Gospel being V among them Rise and Shine
[1:31] for the light to come to you the light
[1:33] of this day Isaiah was the light of his
[1:36] day Noah was the light of his day why he
[1:39] had the word
[1:41] manifested and the gospel the Bible
[1:44] words for this day is the light of the
[1:47] day what a glorious time that we're
[1:50] living now good morning peace darkness
[1:54] is gathering what's together for to show
[1:56] the light Isaiah 161 rise and sh for the
[2:00] light has come to you that's the reason
[2:03] I say
[2:04] shalom the light has come to you God's
[2:08] peace to the
[2:10] elected woman to the elected L those who
[2:14] got before the foundation world called
[2:16] out and ordain to that rest never see
[2:21] they'll never
[2:22] know the Bible said so Jesus said no man
[2:26] will come to me except my father draws
[2:27] me first and all the father to me will
[2:31] come that's there stood Judas light
[2:34] shining up here but back in his heart
[2:36] was dark seed when The Showdown come the
[2:38] darkness show here was the little woman
[2:41] all blacked out up here in front but
[2:43] down here was a predestinated seed and
[2:45] when the light come it's scattered the
[2:47] dark and showed forth we know messiah's
[2:50] coming in he does he'll show us these
[2:53] things Jesus said I am
[2:56] he but Judas doubted it yetos in the
[3:00] light see the light up here doesn't
[3:02] matter it's the light down here that
[3:04] counts the light up here walk and
[3:06] fellowship and everything else but when
[3:08] the real power of God comes in it can't
[3:10] come back to this Dead Sea it'll reflect
[3:12] off in the denomination but when it's
[3:14] back down here a genuine predestinated
[3:17] seed when that light comes down here
[3:18] shows all the darkness away from you and
[3:20] puts you in fellowship with Christ he
[3:23] was the one who gave you the life before
[3:25] the foundation of the world otherwise
[3:28] you'll never see it but God said now to
[3:31] you predestinated seed
[3:33] Shalom amen God's peace rest up on you
[3:37] because we're near the end now we're
[3:39] right down near the end we're going to
[3:41] talk about that group for a while Shalom
[3:44] God's light has come the word light is
[3:46] Vindicated again so that you can see the
[3:49] manifestations of the promise of God for
[3:52] this
[3:53] day search the scripture and then you
[3:57] think you have eternal
[3:58] life the day that we're living
[4:01] in what is the line of the day what do
[4:04] the Bible promise for this day see what
[4:07] hour it is no wonder if Jesus rebuked
[4:09] him for not believing John he was the
[4:11] light because the prophet said he would
[4:13] come and there he was the manifested
[4:15] light they didn't see it they didn't
[4:18] understand it they thought it was the
[4:19] Messiah and they thought something else
[4:21] and this another they failed to see it
[4:24] Jesus come on two lights can't shine the
[4:26] same time there can't be a church God
[4:29] light shine at the same time got to be
[4:33] God's light puts out the church light
[4:35] that's exactly what's taking place
[4:37] today God separating churchism from his
[4:42] life of the promised word of this hour
[4:44] that we're living in that's the truth

[4:49] that but you just wait to find out if
[4:50] it's so or not don't wait you better get

[45:38] I was here but there's there brother
[45:40] Solomon knows what I'm talking about
[45:41] there's certain places you look forward
[45:42] to going and preaching because you know
[45:44] the people are going to pull on the
[45:46] world on the word and I'll let you in on
[45:48] the secret this is one of those places
[45:50] amen so we really enjoy getting to come
[45:52] here and and get to uh get to just share
[45:55] the word of the Lord with you you amen
[45:58] uh to be honest I'm I'm a little caught
[46:00] off guard even though brother uh Stephen
[46:02] invited me last week the lord caught me
[46:05] off guard I had been I had been studying
[46:07] something out all week and probably
[46:09] about two weeks ago the lord gave me a
[46:11] thought and I put it together or Lord
[46:13] put it together you know I guess it's
[46:14] for another time but but he woke me up a
[46:17] couple weeks ago about i' say 5 in the
[46:19] morning before church and I just started
[46:22] had a little thought come to my heart
[46:23] and it just kind of filled all together
[46:25] and I said well you know I guess Seth
[46:27] said I'll preach that t tonight but that
[46:30] wasn't what the Lord said so I I went
[46:32] down to my study about three o'clock and
[46:34] the Lord just soon as I sat down he just
[46:36] laid something else on my heart and very
[46:39] simple thought this this evening but I'm
[46:41] so glad that God is in Simplicity amen I
[46:45] tell you what I'm glad that uh he he
[46:47] made it simple for for an old country
[46:49] boy like me that I can't figure nothing
[46:51] else out I'm not smart enough amen amen
[46:54] but if you have your Bibles I'd like to
[46:56] start and Jeremiah 2911
[47:00] and
[47:02] amen
[47:04] amen y'all better be
[47:07] careful Solomon might start preaching
[47:09] from the seat back there y'all pull too
[47:12] hard we can do a tag team if you
[47:15] want
[47:17] amen about 30 minutes I'll come back
[47:20] there and you come up here all right
[47:24] amen Jeremiah y'all have to forgive me
[47:27] amen amen Jeremiah 29:11 it says for I
[47:30] know the thoughts that I think towards
[47:32] you saith the Lord thoughts of peace and
[47:36] not of evil to give you an expected end
[47:40] now if you
[47:44] notice amen if you notice here in the
[47:48] 13th verse and it said and you shall
[47:51] seek me and find me when you shall
[47:55] search for me
[47:57] with all your heart now I want to if you
[48:00] turn your Bibles to Mark
[48:02] 5:35 I want to speak on something that
[48:05] the Lord laid on my heart of trouble the
[48:07] master trouble the
[48:09] master
[48:12] amen trouble the
[48:15] master I was putting out putting out
[48:18] some mulch around my house a couple
[48:20] weeks ago and and I started thinking
[48:23] about that trouble why trouble the
[48:25] master any farther
[48:27] and Lord just laid that on my heart at
[48:29] that time and I guess it was resting
[48:31] there for this
[48:32] time Mark 5:35 it says while he yet
[48:37] spake there came from the ruler of the
[48:40] synagogue's house a certain which
[48:43] said thy daughter is
[48:46] dead why trouble us the master any
[48:49] further and as soon as Jesus heard the
[48:52] word that was spoken he saith under the
[48:53] ruler of the synagogue be not afraid
[48:57] only believe Amen Let Us bow our heads
[49:03] dear heavenly father Lord Jesus we come
[49:06] before you tonight Lord and father you
[49:08] know from My Heart Lord I'm trying to
[49:10] obey your word Lord father Lord there's
[49:13] Lord in my own ability Lord there would
[49:15] be other things Lord that in that Seth
[49:18] coffee would would want to preach Lord
[49:20] if I'm being honest but Lord you laid
[49:23] this little thought on my heart father
[49:25] and who am I Lord to go go against the
[49:27] mind of god father but Lord we just ask
[49:30] in this service Lord father as we try to
[49:32] obey your will Lord in your way father

[49:37] have preeminence in this service Lord

[50:07] heart father I'm asking Lord you would

[50:17] this day and all that you've done for us
[50:19] Lord father that we were able to wake up

[50:25] that today oh my Mighty God father but

[50:51] Thanksgiving almighty god father we love
[50:54] you we praise you and we thank you for
[50:56] all that you do do for us in Jesus
[50:57] Christ's name amen amen amen you may be
[51:00] seated amen so this Mark 5:35 the story
[51:05] that is in the Bible actually starts
[51:06] with a man by the name of Jas and I call
[51:09] it Jas I know there's many different
[51:10] ways that you could say it but but
[51:12] that's the way that I've always said it
[51:14] and and you can look at this man jaras
[51:16] and and and brother Brandon would call
[51:18] jaras a secret believer that's right he
[51:20] would begin to say that that that he
[51:22] seen Jesus and he knew Jesus was right
[51:24] but because of of all the things that
[51:26] were tied to him that's you know he was
[51:28] a popular person and a lot of people
[51:30] liked him and and you know he just had a
[51:32] good reputation among the people and he
[51:34] knew that if he ever took sides with
[51:37] this Jesus then he would have to give up
[51:39] the other things and and because of this
[51:42] in his life he he you know he had all
[51:44] this going right for him but I believe
[51:46] with all my heart that down inside of
[51:48] Jas was a predestinated seed on the
[51:51] inside of him and almighty God was not
[51:54] going to let that predestinated seed
[51:56] fall
[51:57] in the wrong ground but it was actually
[51:58] in good ground it just needed to be
[52:00] manifested is that right and Jas one day
[52:03] see God will actually allow things to
[52:06] happen to get you into the position that
[52:09] you need to be so because jaras was
[52:12] wanting to be a secret believer or you
[52:16] know he's seen these things God would
[52:17] actually just like job God would begin
[52:20] to allow Satan to say do whatever you
[52:23] want to him but don't take his life so
[52:25] so would actually begin to attack the
[52:29] house of jaras so that God could get Jas
[52:32] in the place that he needed to be so God
[52:35] would take this trial he would take this
[52:37] situation and put it in gas's house you
[52:40] know I don't know how long it happened
[52:42] but but maybe one day he began maybe two
[52:45] months before Jesus was ever to walk
[52:47] through that land his little daughter
[52:49] began to get sick it wasn't nothing too
[52:51] crazy but maybe she began to take a
[52:53] little bit of a fever and and you know
[52:55] week after week thought that the virus
[52:57] would pass but but it begin to get worse
[53:00] and worse and worse and Jas every now
[53:02] and then maybe he'd be going can I just
[53:04] dramatize this for a little bit maybe
[53:06] every now and then he would be going
[53:08] down throughout the streets and he would
[53:09] begin to see somebody with their hands
[53:11] raised up and praising almighty God and
[53:13] he be to say well what are you praising
[53:15] God for and he be let me to tell you I
[53:17] was once a leper but this man named
[53:19] Jesus came by and he touched me and I
[53:22] asked him Lord if thou will if thou just
[53:24] will I can be made whole and Jesus
[53:27] looked at me in the face jaras and he
[53:29] looked right at me and he said I will
[53:31] and from that moment on my skin begin to
[53:33] grow back normal it was a miracle in
[53:35] that moment that almighty God healed me
[53:37] and he be to think you know I've read of
[53:40] a god like that I'm in these books day
[53:42] in and day out and I've read of a god
[53:44] like that all throughout my life and I
[53:46] want to see a living God like that and
[53:48] he begin to think in the back of his M
[53:50] you know I have a little daughter back
[53:52] at home that needs a living God like
[53:55] that in our life and you know he begin
[53:57] to he began to go through his life there
[53:59] and he begin to go to the synagogue day
[54:01] in and and day out and teaching and
[54:03] doing everything that he could but but
[54:05] you know in all that he begin to realize
[54:08] there's something lacking in my life he
[54:10] be to realize there's something lacking
[54:12] in this church we need a living God
[54:14] Among Us you know they they might have
[54:16] begin to to pray for their daughter and
[54:18] she just kept getting worse and worse
[54:20] and worse and finally it came down to a
[54:23] time of decision for jeras on which side
[54:26] of the road he was going to be on was he
[54:28] going to be on the side of the Pharisees
[54:30] and the and the self-righteous or or
[54:33] would he take up this cross with the
[54:35] Lord Jesus Christ and one day he began
[54:37] to say you know if I don't make a
[54:39] decision now my daughter's going to die
[54:42] and there'll be nothing left so he
[54:44] begins to make the decision you know
[54:45] what I don't care what it cost me
[54:47] Hallelujah I don't care what it comes to
[54:50] Hallelujah I know that there's a living
[54:52] God in the land at this time yes my
[54:55] brother and if I can just get to him if
[54:58] I can just trouble the master I've heard
[55:00] what's happened for the leper I've heard
[55:02] what's happened for the blind I've heard
[55:04] what's happened for the beggar I know
[55:06] that that same God he can do it for my
[55:09] house yes my brother yes
[55:12] sir he also knew that it would take him
[55:16] Hallelujah forgetting himself that's
[55:18] right and coming to a place where he was
[55:21] willing to trouble the master yes my
[55:24] brother yes and he began to go on on a
[55:26] journey and brother Brandon would would
[55:28] tap it as a few hours long go ahead and
[55:30] he would go into a journey and he would
[55:32] finally come to the Lord Jesus cuz maybe
[55:34] his wife was was sitting there and said
[55:37] honey she ain't got much longer and
[55:38] maybe he has a little private
[55:40] conversation with his wife and he says
[55:41] I've got to go and maybe she begins to
[55:44] say you know I felt the whole time that
[55:46] this was the right thing and we need to
[55:48] do it and he begin to say you know it
[55:50] might cost me everything and brother
[55:52] Brandon Begin to say that that because
[55:54] they didn't have the same Fellowship
[55:55] card everybody in the synagogue said if
[55:58] you even if you uh associate with this
[56:01] he said there's a lot of people out
[56:02] there that want to associate with this
[56:05] but they can't associate with it they're
[56:07] worried about what everybody else thinks
[56:08] that's exactly right but he said you
[56:11] know it's come to the time of decision
[56:13] yes sir and he went out there and he
[56:15] found this Jesus and he said if you'll
[56:17] just come into my house and if you'll
[56:19] just lay your hands on my daughter I
[56:21] know that she'll be well and Jesus said
[56:24] I will go and Jesus begins to go with
[56:26] them and even on the way there there's a
[56:28] woman with a blood issue that presses
[56:31] her way through the crowd she's trying
[56:33] to get to the master to trouble the
[56:35] master and she begins to work her way
[56:37] through the crowd and she has to push
[56:39] through this one and push through that
[56:41] one and push through what this one says
[56:43] and get through what that one says but
[56:45] she finally gets to the master and she
[56:47] troubles the master so much that the
[56:50] Lord Jesus said who touched me but a lot
[56:52] of different people were touching him so
[56:55] there was a touch that troubled the
[56:57] master so much that he stopped in his
[56:59] track and he be to look around and he
[57:02] said who touched me you know why because
[57:04] she made up in her mind by saying that
[57:06] if I can just touch his clothes I know
[57:09] I'll be made whole glory to God but she
[57:12] had to be willing to trouble the master
[57:15] yes
[57:16] sir so SAS begins to see this and he
[57:19] begins go my What a Mighty Miracle as
[57:21] they're headed back and and on their way
[57:24] back you see Church this is what I want
[57:26] to get you to take your time brother yes
[57:29] sir it's good to say that God is good
[57:32] and uhuh and our testimonies and our
[57:34] praise reports are great when we get to
[57:37] Jesus and we confess Jesus and oh God's
[57:40] my
[57:41] healer oh God's going to bring me
[57:43] through but where so many Christians
[57:46] fail right is on their way to their
[57:49] praise report you remember the praise
[57:51] request the prayer request and the
[57:53] praise report you done got me messed up
[57:55] saying I'm wrong
[57:56] but but on the way to the praise report
[58:01] you get another prayer request and on
[58:04] the way you've already met Jesus you've
[58:06] already had hands laid on you or
[58:08] whatever it might be the prayer of faith
[58:10] shall save the sick but on the way back
[58:13] but see you can't stop
[58:15] there you got to be willing to trouble
[58:18] the master further yes my brother and
[58:21] and you see after he got the report the
[58:23] great report that Jesus is going to come
[58:26] with me Jesus is going to come to my
[58:28] house Jesus is going to heal my daughter
[58:31] he just healed this one with a blood
[58:33] issue right but then on the way he gets
[58:37] bad news that's it preaching now now you
[58:40] already know that doesn't change the
[58:42] situation but Jas in the moment in the
[58:46] moment Jas is thinking what's going on
[58:49] and he begins to see a man with with
[58:51] sack clock and Ashes on his head and
[58:53] they knew that that was going to be a
[58:55] bad sign he to say what are you doing
[58:58] here and the man looked jeras right in
[59:01] the face see this is where Satan comes
[59:03] to you yes my brother this is where
[59:05] Satan will meet you at when you've been
[59:08] prayed for when when you confessed your
[59:10] faith see brother bam said that God
[59:12] would allow that to happen that he would
[59:14] allow Satan to take his punch at you
[59:17] that's right and if you stop right there
[59:20] that's as far as you'll get but he be to
[59:23] say don't trouble the master any
[59:26] further uhh the devil will look at you
[59:29] and say I don't trouble the master any
[59:32] further sure Jesus is able to do it but
[59:34] are you even worthy to come in his
[59:36] presence should you even ask him come on
[59:39] somebody the devil will tell you that
[59:41] but while Satan is speaking in this mind
[59:45] there's something on the inside of
[59:46] jariah yes my brother he looks at Jesus
[59:49] and Jesus said unto him fear not only
[59:52] believe that's right fear not only
[59:55] believe yes my brother in other words

[1:00:03] you that's fear not only believe yes my
[1:00:07] [Music]

[1:00:11] Jesus is saying the man is coming to him
[1:00:14] from the synagogue and say why trouble
[1:00:16] the master any further but Jesus is
[1:00:19] inviting jise trouble me further uh-huh

[1:01:25] ask to too much of God no sir I believe
[1:01:28] the scripture said you have not because
[1:01:30] you ask not and you ask not because you
[1:01:34] believe not that's right he wants us to
[1:01:36] ask and believe that our Joys would be
[1:01:39] full yes my brother he wants you to ask
[1:01:42] abundantly that's ask for big
[1:01:45] things big things yes my brother don't

[1:02:19] imagine talking about exhausting God's
[1:02:22] love and power and beneficiaries for you

[1:02:28] that long way out here in the middle of
[1:02:31] the ocean say now wait a minute I better
[1:02:33] consider this is this thing I better

[1:02:41] about that big in the middle of the
[1:02:42] ocean out here well that's that could be
[1:02:45] that could easily be done more easy it's
[1:02:49] easier for that fish to drink up the
[1:02:51] ocean then you could ask too much of God
[1:02:55] he's an exhaustible Fountain of Life

[1:06:25] everything ain't on his shoulders at the
[1:06:27] time he has the time to be troubled
[1:06:30] that's exactly right he has the time to
[1:06:33] hear a voice from a little blind man a
[1:06:35] little blind beggar a blind beggar that

[1:07:58] he's enough to do there's no need of you
[1:07:59] trying to trouble him just keep your
[1:08:01] peace but that didn't stop him no he
[1:08:04] wanted to speak with a rock and he

[1:08:41] shot at jeras and he began to say jeras
[1:08:44] don't trouble the master your daughter's
[1:08:45] already dead and then they come to Blind
[1:08:48] bardus who ain't even got SAT but one
[1:08:50] thing he's got is a voice and when he
[1:08:52] would try to cry out for that voice the

[1:08:56] be quiet don't worry
[1:08:58] about it's just chatter chatter chatter
[1:09:01] as brother Brandon would say it was just

[1:09:46] preaching this glorious gospel this is
[1:09:48] life yes sir this is me troubling the

[1:10:04] is too busy for you he's got too much
[1:10:06] going on in the world no sir whether
[1:10:08] it's the cross of Calvary on his

[1:10:30] him be of good Comfort rise he calleth
[1:10:33] thee he calleth thee Oh a deep call to
[1:10:37] the deep and he casteth away His Garment
[1:10:39] Rose brother bandam said it was it was a
[1:10:42] cold a cold time and and he took that
[1:10:45] garment and threw it back and said I
[1:10:46] ain't going to need this no more I ain't
[1:10:48] going to need this no more Rose and came
[1:10:51] to Jesus and Jesus answered and said
[1:10:53] unto him what will thou that I should go
[1:10:55] unto thee should do unto thee and the
[1:10:56] blind man said unto him Lord that I
[1:10:58] might receive my sight and Jesus said
[1:11:00] unto him go thy way thy faith has made
[1:11:03] thee whole and
[1:11:05] immediately immediately he received his
[1:11:08] sight and followed Jesus in the way
[1:11:11] glory to God you got time for
[1:11:14] another like I said this is simple but
[1:11:16] this is your life this is my life this
[1:11:19] is where we're
[1:11:21] walking can you say
[1:11:24] Amen listen church can you can you can
[1:11:26] you bear another but listen I I begin to
[1:11:29] look at this and I can only explain it
[1:11:30] how God shows it to me and as I was
[1:11:33] sitting there he began to say show that
[1:11:35] in Mary and Martha and Lazarus and I
[1:11:36] said okay Lord and I begin to begin it
[1:11:39] said then Martha as soon as she heard
[1:11:41] that Jesus was coming went and met him
[1:11:44] but Mary sat still in the house then
[1:11:46] said Martha unto Jesus Lord if thou Hast
[1:11:49] been here my brother had not died so
[1:11:52] she's admitting she has Faith right here
[1:11:54] right she's admitting that she has faith
[1:11:56] for the situation if she would have got
[1:11:59] there if he would have got there before
[1:12:01] he died then said uh my brother had not
[1:12:04] died but I know that even now whatsoever
[1:12:08] thou will ask God God will give it to
[1:12:11] thee and Jesus said unto her thy brother
[1:12:15] shall rise
[1:12:16] again Martha said unto him I know he
[1:12:19] shall rise again at the resurrection at
[1:12:20] the last day and Je you know I love that
[1:12:23] scripture exceedingly
[1:12:25] abundantly above all that we could ask
[1:12:28] or think because Martha's mind is going
[1:12:31] to yeah one day he's going to rise again
[1:12:33] but God's saying listen your brother's
[1:12:35] going to get two
[1:12:39] resurrections th brother shall rise
[1:12:42] again and Martha said un him I know that
[1:12:43] he shall rise again at the resurrection
[1:12:45] at the last day and Jesus said unto her
[1:12:47] I am the resurrection and the life he
[1:12:50] that believeth in me though he were dead
[1:12:52] yet shall he live and whosoever liveth
[1:12:55] in believeth in me shall never die he
[1:12:57] said believest thou this in other words
[1:13:00] are you ready to trouble me over this
[1:13:02] believest thou this she said to him yay
[1:13:04] Lord I believe that thou are the Christ
[1:13:05] the son of God which should come into
[1:13:07] the world now listen there's a little
[1:13:08] bit that goes on here we're going to
[1:13:10] jump from 27 to the 39th verse and
[1:13:12] listen so so Jesus begins to talk to
[1:13:16] Martha and Martha runs back and gets
[1:13:18] Mary and says the master call for you
[1:13:21] and they begin to talk talk to Jesus and
[1:13:23] in this time Jesus is crying Jesus is
[1:13:25] weeping but he done told her I am the
[1:13:27] resurrection I am the life and and in
[1:13:31] the 39th verse Jesus said unto her take
[1:13:34] away the
[1:13:38] stone come on
[1:13:44] God take away the
[1:13:47] stone do you know what happens after to
[1:13:50] a body after a few days I'm a big hunter
[1:13:53] I'm a big fisherman I know what happens
[1:13:55] to a body after a few days after it's
[1:13:57] dead it ain't the greatest thing to be
[1:14:00] around and she heard that Jesus was come
[1:14:03] I'm sorry and Jesus said take away the
[1:14:05] stone Martha the sister of him that was
[1:14:09] dead Sith unto the Lord by this time he
[1:14:12] stinketh for he has been dead four days
[1:14:16] Jesus said unto her said I not unto
[1:14:23] thee Jesus said Earth say I not unto
[1:14:26] thee that if thou wouldest believe thou
[1:14:30] shouldest see the glory of God now I
[1:14:34] imagine when Jesus says this in that
[1:14:38] moment every single person looks at
[1:14:42] Martha because remember that's Martha's
[1:14:45] family member she's the one that has a
[1:14:48] right to say take that stone away or
[1:14:51] leave that stone right
[1:14:54] there
[1:14:56] you see all that was her family's
[1:14:59] resting place that was her family's tomb
[1:15:03] only she had the right her sister had
[1:15:05] the right to say move the stone
[1:15:09] away but they begin to look at
[1:15:12] her and they begin to think they must
[1:15:15] think in their mind can I say it this
[1:15:16] way will she trouble the master any
[1:15:23] further she's already called for the
[1:15:25] master the master was 4 days late but
[1:15:27] the master finally showed up she begins
[1:15:30] to talk to the master and say I know
[1:15:32] that even now whatever you ask God will
[1:15:35] do
[1:15:36] it but now they're one and she's she's
[1:15:39] already asked all that he's already here
[1:15:42] he's already gave the promise that he'll
[1:15:44] rise again but will she trouble the
[1:15:47] master any
[1:15:52] further will she trouble the m any
[1:15:55] further then they took away the stone so
[1:15:59] at one point Martha must have said run
[1:16:01] out of the way whatever he says do it
[1:16:05] just like Mary at the wedding supper
[1:16:09] whatever he says no matter how crazy it
[1:16:12] seems if he says put water in the barrel
[1:16:14] and it'll be wi you better start filling
[1:16:16] up the
[1:16:17] [Applause]
[1:16:21] barrels the place and then they took
[1:16:25] away the Stone from the place where the
[1:16:27] dead was laid and Jesus lifted up his
[1:16:29] eyes and said father I thank thee that
[1:16:31] thou has heard me and I knew that thou
[1:16:33] has heard me always but of the people
[1:16:35] which stand by I said it that they may
[1:16:38] may believe that thou has sent me and
[1:16:40] when he had thus spoken he cried with a
[1:16:43] loud voice Lazarus come forth and he
[1:16:47] that was dead came forth bound hand and
[1:16:49] foot with grave clothes and his face was
[1:16:52] bound about with a napkin and Jesus said
[1:16:55] them loose him and let him
[1:16:57] go why did the miracle happen because
[1:17:00] they were not afraid to take God at his
[1:17:03] word they were not afraid to look at God
[1:17:06] and say no matter how crazy it sounds up
[1:17:08] here no matter what Satan is saying in
[1:17:10] my mind I refuse to believe that and I
[1:17:13] believe the one and true son of almighty
[1:17:18] God but I'm say could you imagine a
[1:17:20] little mouse about that long in the
[1:17:21] great Garners of Egypt saying I better
[1:17:23] get two grains a day it might not last
[1:17:25] through the winter oh my you can't he
[1:17:28] wants you to ask abundant so that your
[1:17:30] Joys could be full don't be afraid to
[1:17:32] ask God for anything for he's willing
[1:17:37] more
[1:17:38] willing to give it than you are to
[1:17:41] receive it if we just get that little
[1:17:43] Shadow wiped away to know that he's
[1:17:46] willing to do it you're his
[1:17:48] children he loves
[1:17:53] you
[1:17:55] brother
[1:17:56] Solomon you thought you knew what it was
[1:17:58] like to be a father but when you became
[1:18:00] a father you
[1:18:03] knew you have all and once you become
[1:18:07] that mother of Father you always thought
[1:18:09] you knew what it would be like but until
[1:18:10] you hold that flesh flesh and blood in
[1:18:13] your hands for the first
[1:18:14] time and you begin to hold that child in
[1:18:17] your hand the first thing that comes
[1:18:19] over you is an instinctive love that
[1:18:21] whatever they need I'm going to take
[1:18:23] care of them whatever they have need of
[1:18:26] I'm going to do it and you know I'm That
[1:18:28] Kind of dad that I want to give my
[1:18:29] children everything that they can have
[1:18:31] need of I want them to ask abundantly I
[1:18:34] want them to see what I can provide for
[1:18:36] them I want to give them the best life
[1:18:38] on this Earth that I can ever give them
[1:18:40] anything that I can do to make them
[1:18:42] happy let me tell you something that
[1:18:44] ain't nothing compared to the love of
[1:18:46] almighty God if we're like that with our
[1:18:48] children and we want our children just
[1:18:50] ask me you know sometimes you get
[1:18:53] offended as a parent sometimes you get
[1:18:56] offended when your child goes and ask
[1:18:58] other people for stuff because you know
[1:19:00] they could just come to you and we ain't
[1:19:02] got to be looking at the devil's tactic
[1:19:04] and the devil's tricks to make us happy
[1:19:07] when we got a heavenly father that takes
[1:19:10] care of
[1:19:11] [Applause]
[1:19:15] us I want to try to I'm trying to bring
[1:19:17] it to a
[1:19:19] close Jesus said unto her said I not

[1:19:25] believe thou should see the glory of God

[1:19:31] but if we just sing
[1:19:33] it what good is it but if you will
[1:19:36] believe tonight you will see the glory
[1:19:40] of God it's not a if it's not a maybe

[1:20:08] realize
[1:20:09] Glory that at the name of Jesus every
[1:20:13] knee shall bow every tongue shall
[1:20:18] confess do you realize that when Lazarus
[1:20:21] and jer's daughter was dead they heard
[1:20:24] the voice voice of the
[1:20:26] resurrection and they begin at death
[1:20:29] begin to give up what it had grasped
[1:20:32] because the resurrection and life had
[1:20:40] spoke brother bam said now talking about
