[20:40] he just
[20:40] roam up and down uh country road

[20:48] the lord gonna allow me to see and she
[20:51] looked at him
[20:52] and we got her around there and we were
[20:53] riding back from the going home service
[20:56] and
[20:56] i said where does he live at she said
[20:58] over there over in that trail i said
[21:00] come on let's go over to the trailer
[21:02] and we went there to the trail and i got
[21:04] there and
[21:05] knocked on the door heard some good uh
