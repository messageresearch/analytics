[0:00] or they were great Mighty Man
[0:02] was great lapse of half-inch brass a up
[0:06] and down their body to covered from a
[0:09] long spear coming or a heart a strike
[0:13] with a 2 8 sword that would have to
[0:16] knock him off their feet
[0:19] now
[0:20] How could a man
[0:22] just one man with a thousand around him
[0:26] armored
[0:28] and test Warriors
[0:31] with Spears those big helmets that only
[0:35] their eyes showed through
[0:38] How could a man take a Jawbone
[0:42] of a new
[0:44] and beat down a thousand of them at one
[0:47] time
[0:48] while the first lick with that old
[0:50] brittle Jawbone would fly out of pieces
[0:53] on one of those helmets
[0:55] they know that some Supernatural
[0:58] strength
[1:02] when he struck that while you're on the
[1:05] head the thing did it in and killed him
[1:08] instantly right hand and left hand he
[1:11] struck it every time he struck the Tower
[1:13] of God struck with him
[1:17] it doesn't take what we would think a
[1:20] great thing
[1:21] it only takes a a hand that's completely
[1:25] Anointed with the Holy Ghost
[1:29] with God's power to strike down any
[1:32] enemy under any circumstance
[1:40] how those Liars remembered
[1:44] could it be possible that we got the
[1:46] wrong man some of them might have said
[1:48] no that's him
[1:51] I could just see a statue
[1:54] that's Samson
[1:56] the one who served what he said was a
[1:58] true God
[2:01] is God sure has forsaken him
[2:05] but they were wrong
[2:07] God had not forsaken him he had forsaken
[2:11] God
[2:14] and I think that's not the way with the
[2:16] people tonight
[2:18] it isn't God has forsaken his church
[2:21] it's the church has forsaken God and his
[2:24] word
[2:27] that's what's the matter
[2:31] notice
[2:32] many of them remembered
[2:35] the group that stood over on one side
[2:38] said I can remember when Delilah
[2:42] took and bounding with ropes
[2:46] that was even our horses couldn't pull
[2:49] apart
[2:51] I am when we come upon him
[2:54] how the day was like little threads he
[2:57] just broke them to pieces
[2:59] and here he stands defeated
[3:03] and another group could remember
[3:06] one night down at Gaza
[3:09] how that they pending in
[3:13] but he still had the anointing on him
[3:17] and they tried to pity me and shut the
[3:20] gates on him they said now we'll pounce
[3:23] upon him
[3:25] but the spirit of the Lord returned to
[3:28] him
[3:31] when he picked up the whole Gates and
[3:34] walked up on the hill with them
[3:38] when a man is in the line of duty for
[3:41] God there's no gate no nothing can stand
[3:45] in his way

[33:57] this Saturday the third at five o'clock
[34:00] in the church here we just need to talk
[34:03] a little bit maybe an hour and 30
[34:05] minutes or a couple hours just set

[34:13] amen if you don't know what's going on
[34:15] you won't know how to behave
[34:17] amen you will just come and go but you
[34:20] don't know what's going on spiritually
[34:22] spiritually it's constantly a battle
[34:25] it's a fight all the time so by the time
[34:27] I'm standing here I already won a lot of
[34:30] victories
[34:31] amen you will get it later glory to God
[34:35] Amen good to see everybody back from
[34:38] Thanksgiving let's go to our scripture
[34:40] tonight in Genesis chapter 2.
[34:44] you will get Genesis chapter one and two
[34:47] until you when you sleep you dream about
[34:49] Genesis chapter one and two
[34:53] amen glory to God hallelujah
[34:59] Genesis chapter 2 verse 7. if you're
[35:03] there you can say Amen
[35:05] the scriptures have layers
[35:11] all scripture have levels
[35:14] so you can have one scripture and you
[35:16] have a level
[35:18] so it depends on how you're pilling the
[35:21] level
[35:22] if you go straight on the first level
[35:24] you're going to stay there and get there
[35:26] and move on but under the scripture
[35:29] there is another layer there that you
[35:31] need to dig and you'll find that layer
[35:33] open up and if you dig again you will
[35:35] find the third layer if you dig again
[35:37] you're going to find the seven lathe
[35:39] amen so that's the way the scripture are
[35:42] meant
[35:43] in other words there is a Bible inside
[35:46] this Bible
[35:49] everybody read this Bible that everybody
[35:51] that is Christian but to read the Bible
[35:54] who is in the Bible you need to know the
[35:57] author of the book
[35:58] amen if not you're just going to read
[36:01] the scripture and just go over it and
[36:03] sometimes it's going to get boring
[36:05] because you don't understand what is
[36:07] going on the son of this the son of this
[36:10] the son of this the son of this and the
[36:12] son of this and you like what is going
[36:14] on with this genealogy it looks like
[36:16] it's a genealogy it's not a genealogy
[36:20] at first it's a genealogy but when you
[36:23] open you peel that layer you look under
[36:25] you're going to see things that are
[36:27] different because God is hiding
[36:30] in Simplicity Genesis chapter 7 I'm
[36:33] trying to warm you up amen glory to God

[39:36] now has a wife
[39:38] amen if you don't know that woman that's
[39:41] a big trouble
[39:42] and the Lord God calls a deep sleep to
[39:46] fall upon who and so who calls Adam to
[39:50] sleep
[39:51] so who started this process who was
[39:54] worried about Adam not having a wife the
[39:56] Lord so everything about Eve didn't
[39:59] start with Satan
[40:01] verse 22 and they read which the Lord
[40:06] God has taken from her man so who took
[40:09] the rib out
[40:11] made a woman so who made the woman
[40:16] so the woman
[40:20] the father
[40:23] or the Creator
[40:27] the creator of the woman
[40:32] of the woman
[40:34] is who
[40:40] do you see a mother over there
[40:45] how did Eve came out
[40:50] so
[40:53] Adam so Eve
[40:56] came
[40:57] out of Adam
[41:00] in other words she came out of her own
[41:03] husband
[41:05] amen we should be good at this time
[41:08] right we already passed that stage so to
[41:11] relax okay
[41:12] and the rib which the Lord God has taken
[41:15] from man made he a woman and brought her
[41:19] to the man
[41:20] a lot of stuff laying right here just
[41:23] without you like reading there amen so
[41:26] we found out here that Eve doesn't have
[41:30] a mother
[41:31] man
[41:33] amen and Eve came with a sex
[41:39] are we okay
[41:40] in other words Adam and Eve didn't have
[41:44] belly button
[41:56] Adam and Eve did not have never
[42:00] [Applause]
[42:04] they didn't have the umbilical cord
[42:08] I know you're struggling with your mind
[42:12] this message is a different language
[42:16] [Applause]
[42:21] let me help you
[42:23] brother Branham someone asked the other
[42:26] day he said brother Branham
[42:30] would there be any difference
[42:32] between Adam and Eve
[42:35] and their children today
[42:38] if they were all naked walking in would
[42:42] their bodies be the same brother Branham
[42:45] say water no sir
[42:48] what is the difference between us and
[42:51] Adam and Eve relax everything is easy
[42:53] and good okay we was coming home from
[42:56] squirrel hunting brother Fred and I and
[42:59] a bunch of them I say no they wouldn't
[43:03] be there same
[43:05] you're doing pretty good my brother
[43:07] say you mean Eve would not be a woman
[43:11] like her daughters
[43:13] and Adam would not be a man like his
[43:16] sons
[43:17] I said in many respects
[43:20] we are the same
[43:22] but not in all water physical respect so
[43:26] what is the difference between us and
[43:28] Adam
[43:31] number one Adam didn't have a mother
[43:36] if they didn't have a mother Adam was
[43:39] born with her sex everybody here is born
[43:42] from sex
[43:46] many different amen and he said what
[43:50] will be the difference I say they would
[43:53] not have any never never now can you say
[43:56] Amen
[43:59] amen
[44:00] they were created right they was not
[44:04] attached to water nothing the message
[44:06] and the Bible are
[44:09] as long as the bear there
[44:12] everybody okay as long as that bears
[44:15] there on everything that is born in this
[44:18] world
[44:19] shows it is it is a water
[44:21] so everybody that is born by sex it's a
[44:26] trouble yes
[44:30] Amen to begin with you keep this I'm
[44:34] preparing you for Sunday amen he said to
[44:38] begin with that is right I said sure
[44:40] there is a difference there will be no
[44:43] never there was not connected to any
[44:46] female to come here so God created them
[44:49] so in other words Adam and Eve didn't
[44:52] have any belly button
[45:00] okay make a good use of your microphone
[45:03] glory to God let's go now to Genesis 3.
[45:09] if you have learned a long time when I
[45:11] ask you a question you know I always
[45:13] have a gun behind
[45:17] so you better respond quickly
[45:21] amen
[45:23] Genesis 3 in other words we try by the
[45:27] best that we can to remain with that
[45:30] word
[45:31] and the message of the hour that's all I
[45:34] know
[45:35] that's all I can feed you
[45:37] let's go to Genesis chapter 3.
[45:43] do you see what I say fight
[45:47] Genesis chapter 3 verse 14 if you dare
[45:49] you can say amen amen
[45:52] the Bible say and the Lord God say to
[45:55] her the serpent because you have done
[45:57] this
[45:58] you are cursed above all cattle and
[46:02] above every beast of the field upon your
[46:05] belly shall you go and thus shall you
[46:08] eat all the days of your life
[46:11] watch now
[46:13] and I will put enmity
[46:15] between you the serpent
[46:18] and the woman
[46:21] so there could not be any friendship
[46:23] between The Serpent and the woman
[46:24] anymore
[46:25] everybody okay
[46:27] and between your
[46:30] the seed of what of who so the serpent
[46:34] has a seed we already went through this
[46:37] everybody okay
[46:40] somebody told someone about the sermon
[46:43] that the pastor was preaching that man
[46:45] who was male and female
[46:47] and I got into the house
[46:50] and the person who said that look at the
[46:53] he's not part of this trade he said you
[46:56] asked the pastor
[46:59] and here I came to do something else I'm
[47:02] right in the middle of a sermon can you
[47:04] explain melon or a male and female I'd
[47:07] say no you bring the Bible
[47:08] I don't want you to live here and say
[47:10] brother Stephen by the time I went one
[47:12] two two twenty minutes the man looked
[47:14] his eyes was wide open
[47:16] I closed there and I was back amen
[47:20] so the serpent has a seed
[47:24] we already know the seed of the serpent
[47:27] I don't know why people fight brother
[47:31] amen it's a waste of time amen and
[47:35] between your seed The Serpent and hair
[47:38] water see
[47:41] Say Amen
[47:43] the Bible said the woman has a seed
[47:49] [Applause]
[47:53] I should be the one doubting because I'm
[47:56] a medical doctor
[47:59] but I learned how to put my medical
[48:01] doctor in the garbage
[48:03] [Applause]
[48:08] when it comes to the word of God
[48:13] a Believer came one time to me I look at
[48:16] the wisdom teeth I say the wisdom teeth
[48:17] need to come out
[48:19] and that person said I will trust God
[48:23] that everything will be all right I
[48:25] don't need to take them out and they
[48:27] quote came straight up to me brother
[48:29] Branham say I will never stand on the
[48:31] way of somebody who want to take God at
[48:34] his word
[48:36] I shut my mouth up and I left the
[48:38] believer till today she's good
[48:43] I learned how to take my doctor and put
[48:47] it down and take the word of God and
[48:49] lift it up
[48:50] [Applause]
[48:53] because heaven and earth will pass away
[48:55] but the word of God will never pass away
[49:01] let every man life every man will be a
[49:04] water only God's word be wanted in this
[49:08] church we preach God's word
[49:13] Oh Glory to God man I feel so good
[49:17] let's preach now
[49:20] so the woman glory to God
[49:24] the woman has a seed whether you like it
[49:29] or not it is that safe the Bible
[49:31] [Applause]
[49:36] the problem is what is the seed of a
[49:39] woman
[49:42] because a woman usually doesn't have a
[49:44] seed
[49:47] that's how you approach the Bible not no
[49:50] no no no that's false no what is God
[49:52] trying to say
[49:54] everybody okay and her seed it shall
[49:58] bruise your water and you shall bruise
[50:01] water it's here everybody okay clear
[50:04] a woman having a seed my goodness
[50:09] [Laughter]
[50:11] verse 16 to the woman he says
[50:16] he didn't say to Eve
[50:21] because he's the one that pulled the
[50:23] wall man out of Adam Adam just gave the
[50:27] revelation of what God did
[50:29] God did the working and Adam gave the
[50:33] Revelation that what God did God made a
[50:37] woo man
[50:39] somebody pull out of me
[50:43] so there is a revelation and a working
[50:50] to the woman he said I will greatly
[50:53] multiply your water so and your water
[50:57] so from here something is introduced
[51:01] here
[51:04] a woman will begin to bring forth
[51:07] children by sex
[51:11] I'm exactly right that's the truth in
[51:14] other words now the woman can become a
[51:17] mother
[51:20] she can have a conception
[51:23] and that happened through sex it was not
[51:26] before
[51:27] God didn't use this route
[51:30] or automatically God created Created
[51:33] that say no intervention of a man a
[51:36] woman no everybody okay
[51:38] and in so why can the curse of the woman
[51:41] be only around her conception all right
[51:44] come on brother you still don't see the
[51:47] serpent see
[51:49] so what caused the original sin it was
[51:52] an apple
[51:54] so the woman eating an apple God doesn't
[51:57] curse the apple he go curse the woman
[52:00] on her conception
[52:08] in sorrow shall you bring forth water
[52:10] children so children now are coming not
[52:14] by the spoken word not by creation
[52:16] they're coming now by a woman
[52:19] amen and you desire a woman through
[52:22] conception and for a woman to conceive
[52:24] you must have the egg and the sperm
[52:27] mixed together everybody okay and your
[52:29] desire shall be to your water and he
[52:32] shall rule over you everybody okay
[52:35] go to Genesis chapter 5.
[52:39] oh Lord
[52:41] it's almost like Sunday
[52:44] 21 minutes reading the description
[52:48] you there verse 1 this is the book of
[52:51] the generation of Adam in the day that
[52:54] God created man in the likeness of God
[52:57] made he him
[52:58] man and water female created he what and
[53:03] he did water bless them so God created
[53:06] them
[53:07] created them
[53:11] and then blessed them
[53:14] not bless him
[53:16] them
[53:17] and call them
[53:21] and their names right
[53:24] one name
[53:26] and that name is Adam
[53:31] glory to God and called their name Adam
[53:36] in the day when they were created
[53:38] everybody okay now let's go to Ephesians
[53:41] 5 and then we pray
[53:43] glory to God
[53:49] Ephesians 5 23.
[53:52] you're there you can say amen for the
[53:55] husband is the head of the wife you
[53:58] begin to get this pretty clear now even
[54:01] as Christ is the head of the church
[54:04] we're dealing with two people there
[54:05] nacho and God Christ
[54:08] and he is the savior of the body
[54:11] everybody okay job to verse 30.
[54:17] he's the savior of the body
[54:19] amen
[54:22] in other words
[54:25] when you have an individual like this
[54:28] I'm just making this simple
[54:31] okay
[54:32] this right here
[54:35] this
[54:37] this
[54:43] okay
[54:45] this is Christ
[54:49] everybody okay everything that is
[54:51] staying here is water
[54:55] the church their body
[54:58] their bribe
[55:01] everybody okay that's the way we work
[55:03] okay so Paul is saying Christ is their
[55:07] head
[55:10] so why does the head come
[55:15] in the airtime
[55:19] so the head will just be working like
[55:21] that
[55:23] huh
[55:27] [Music]
[55:29] I need to make it this way so it can
[55:32] soak pretty good
[55:35] have you seen the head walking like this
[55:39] if you see this there gotta be another
[55:42] party
[55:43] [Applause]
[55:49] you cannot reveal the head
[55:54] without the body
[55:57] oh God
[56:01] oh my God this church God so we are he's
[56:07] the Savior he's the head he's the savior
[56:10] of the
[56:11] okay
[56:13] verse 30 for we are a member of his
[56:16] water body that's why we call Santa the
[56:19] Beloved the the the joint all this
[56:22] terminology
[56:24] amen we are a member of his body of the
[56:28] and of his body Karma of his flesh and
[56:31] of his water so you can see like we are
[56:34] the eve
[56:35] [Music]
[56:36] of Christ we are the woman of Christ
[56:42] [Applause]
[56:47] everybody okay
[56:49] verse 31 for this cause shall a man do
[56:53] it
[56:54] leaves his water his father and water
[56:56] his mouth and shall be join joins me in
[56:59] water
[57:01] United means water aha that's the way
[57:04] you go straight to the point
[57:06] amen and shall be married to his water
[57:09] why
[57:11] so if marriage must come who must bring
[57:15] the marriage
[57:16] God
[57:18] the man must come when the men come he's
[57:22] coming with marriage Behold The Proud
[57:25] gum
[57:26] go I to do what me him
[57:30] he didn't means they go out and they say
[57:33] good morning good morning you're doing
[57:34] okay that say you meet him that's not
[57:36] what they were saying
[57:37] go out to

[57:44] entered into marriage
[57:48] amen he said for this God shall a man
[57:52] leave a mother and a father father and
[57:54] mother and shall be joined to his wife
[57:56] not somebody else's wife and the two
[57:59] shall be water one flesh so marriage
[58:01] brings back the original picture
[58:05] [Applause]
[58:08] because man was one
[58:11] creation split them you remember on
[58:13] Sunday then marriage through Redemption
[58:15] bring back again
[58:17] and then when they are drawn you cannot
[58:20] play with one

[1:04:41] one in the spirit just like in the first
[1:04:45] Adam there was no difference between
[1:04:47] Adam and Eve in the spirit
[1:04:51] there is no time
[1:04:59] Dominion given to Adam who wants to sell
[1:05:03] the Lord
[1:05:07] [Applause]

[1:06:25] cleaned out the blackness and made it
[1:06:28] all work why why there was that see
[1:06:31] laying down the water yesterday that was
[1:06:35] that he was God before the foundation of
[1:06:38] the world if you are a Christian now a
[1:06:42] genuine predestinated ones he was well
[1:06:46] you

[1:06:56] always was wet in other words you never
[1:07:00] had that beginning
[1:07:01] [Applause]
[1:07:19] [Music]
[1:07:31] in other words in the spirit there is no
[1:07:34] difference
[1:07:36] that's why Paul says this
[1:07:39] Hallelujah that's why Paul says this he
[1:07:43] said for ye have not received the spirit
[1:07:46] of what they get to do what
[1:07:49] Pentecostal understanding entering God
[1:07:52] to tremble
[1:07:53] oh
[1:08:03] [Applause]
[1:08:05] [Music]
[1:08:07] Our Father Amanda the spirit itself very

[1:08:51] so in the spirits there is no difference
[1:08:54] we and our husband we are awesome
[1:09:01] [Music]
[1:09:04] now in Genesis 2 7.
[1:09:08] Genesis 2 7 of the lamb and also 21 22.
[1:09:15] what happened in Genesis 2 7 okay glory
[1:09:19] to God
[1:09:20] amen
[1:09:23] glory to God brother but I'm saying you
[1:09:25] lucky how God placed that
[1:09:29] God is the water
[1:09:32] that brought forth who Jesus
[1:09:35] Jesus and God is a
[1:09:37] spirit so they could not be any water
[1:09:39] sex there could not be any sexual desire
[1:09:42] because if he was then Jesus was now who
[1:09:45] was not born a water virgin born
[1:09:48] what are you trying to say brother
[1:09:50] Stephen this is what I'm trying to say
[1:09:53] according to Genesis chapter 2 verse 7
[1:09:56] of Jesus Christ open revelation 12.
[1:10:01] Maya I'm good in time so relax
[1:10:06] if you dare you can say man amen we want
[1:10:09] to see how was Jesus created in a body
[1:10:13] everybody okay according to Adam Adam
[1:10:16] was created from the Dust
[1:10:18] no sex no father no matter nothing
[1:10:20] everybody okay according to uh if Eve
[1:10:24] also came from Adam no matter no sex
[1:10:27] nothing but just a byproduct now we're
[1:10:29] talking about the second Adam how was
[1:10:31] the second Adam created over here there
[1:10:34] is no difference everything is
[1:10:35] similarity but remember with the first
[1:10:39] Adam the spirit was correct but in the
[1:10:43] body we have similarities and
[1:10:46] differences so if the first Adam in the
[1:10:49] body had similarities and differences so
[1:10:53] the second Adam also in the body must
[1:10:55] have some
[1:10:57] and water because God does not change
[1:11:04] let's go to Revelation chapter 12. I
[1:11:07] believe it's my battery my brother
[1:11:10] if you're there you can say a man first
[1:11:13] one and there appear a great water
[1:11:16] wonder do you know what that Wonder
[1:11:18] means
[1:11:19] it means a Sana
[1:11:22] they appear a great son
[1:11:26] if you look at another translation it
[1:11:28] will tell you probably a son a Wonder
[1:11:30] it's a sign there was a wonder that
[1:11:33] appeared there
[1:11:34] there was a son that appeared there
[1:11:37] everybody okay
[1:11:39] and the sun was what a woman in heaven a
[1:11:43] what a woman do you know that woman
[1:11:46] do we know her
[1:11:48] we don't know her her name is a woman
[1:11:52] remember Adam had a woman
[1:11:56] there is a woman
[1:11:58] who is she we need to find out
[1:12:01] there is a woman clothed with the sun
[1:12:04] and the moon under her feet
[1:12:06] and upon her head a crown of 12 Stars
[1:12:09] I'm skipping this you know that
[1:12:11] job to verse 2.
[1:12:13] and she being with water ciao
[1:12:18] tried traveling in water and paint to
[1:12:22] the water so the woman was pregnant
[1:12:26] can you say man
[1:12:28] this woman is pregnant
[1:12:32] and she's pregnant with a child
[1:12:35] the problem is we don't know her husband
[1:12:42] who is the husband of this woman
[1:12:45] we don't know
[1:12:47] number two who is the father of this boy
[1:12:51] we don't know and who is this woman
[1:12:54] herself we don't know
[1:12:59] everybody okay we're talking about the
[1:13:01] Genesis 2 7 of the second Adam
[1:13:04] now we are invest the job to verse 5.
[1:13:08] and she brought forth a water now it's
[1:13:12] more clear
[1:13:13] so the child could be a woman a girl or
[1:13:18] a boy now it's a difference we know
[1:13:20] clearly that the child is not a girl
[1:13:25] okay the child is a
[1:13:29] man if you notice the Bible doesn't say
[1:13:32] a Boy Child
[1:13:34] [Applause]
[1:13:37] scripture don't play with water the
[1:13:40] Bible said amen child so even though you

[1:13:48] [Applause]
[1:13:50] when you see that baby crying
[1:13:55] and drinking milk that baby is a man
[1:14:07] that's why brother Branham said he was
[1:14:09] Jehovah crying
[1:14:15] oh Lord have mercy
[1:14:18] are we okay
[1:14:19] he said if she was brought forth a man
[1:14:23] shot this Manchester so this child we

[1:14:30] and this man Chad has to do what this
[1:14:34] Manchester
[1:14:35] who has to rule how many nations All
[1:14:39] Nations

[1:14:45] so this man's child will rule all
[1:14:49] missing
[1:14:51] who's that person
[1:14:54] amen All Nations
[1:15:01] the word caught up
[1:15:04] brother Branham say it's the word for
[1:15:07] rapture
[1:15:08] you shall be changed and be caught up in
[1:15:12] other words this child will receive a
[1:15:15] rapture
[1:15:17] we're trying to find out who this woman
[1:15:19] is
[1:15:20] this child will receive a rapture Lord
[1:15:24] help me move forward
[1:15:27] and he will be ratchet wrapped he will
[1:15:31] be caught up to water to God
[1:15:37] discharge when he is gonna be raptured
[1:15:40] he will go into God
[1:15:45] everybody okay
[1:15:46] so if this child going to God where did
[1:15:49] he came out
[1:15:51] everybody okay can you preach with me
[1:15:54] because I know somebody who said I came
[1:15:57] from God and I will go back to what God
[1:16:06] in Acts chapter 1 verse 9 they saw him
[1:16:10] going up
[1:16:11] and the Bible say a crowd came you know
[1:16:14] that's for you yes yes do you know that
[1:16:16] scripture amen
[1:16:17] if you don't know raise your hand
[1:16:21] keep your finger here let's go to act
[1:16:24] chapter one I don't want to lose
[1:16:25] somebody
[1:16:27] let's go to Acts chapter one
[1:16:30] verse 9. let's go quick so we can move
[1:16:34] if you dare you can say Amen
[1:16:37] and when he had spoken Jesus these
[1:16:40] things why they be held he was what
[1:16:43] taken out
[1:16:44] everybody okay and they do any what
[1:16:47] cloud receive him out of the waters
[1:16:49] everybody clear so let's go back so this
[1:16:52] child will be raptured caught up and
[1:16:55] what happened when he got there a crowd
[1:16:58] came and did what
[1:17:01] everybody okay a cloud open
[1:17:04] and Jesus entered the crowd and the
[1:17:07] cloud closes
[1:17:08] so in other words he must be during the
[1:17:10] day
[1:17:13] everybody okay
[1:17:15] now everybody okay it happened during
[1:17:17] the day
[1:17:20] no wonder the Rapture happened and he
[1:17:22] said and I'll leave it alone
[1:17:23] everybody okay everybody okay he said
[1:17:27] and he the child was caught up to God
[1:17:29] and to his water
[1:17:35] so this child not only does he enter God
[1:17:38] but he goes to the throne of God
[1:17:42] so who is this baby
[1:17:49] everybody okay
[1:17:51] and to God's Throne so who is this baby
[1:17:56] somebody is afraid who is this baby
[1:17:59] Jesus Christ
[1:18:03] Jesus jump to verse 17.
[1:18:07] everybody okay
[1:18:09] and the dragon was angry with who the
[1:18:12] woman do we know her
[1:18:15] she was angry with the woman
[1:18:18] amen and went to make war with their
[1:18:22] remnant of water per se
[1:18:29] how many so the woman has a
[1:18:35] now we found out that right here we back
[1:18:40] again with the seed of the woman
[1:18:42] [Music]
[1:18:47] so this woman that brought forth Jesus
[1:18:51] Christ is the woman that was prophesied
[1:18:55] in Genesis chapter one that the woman
[1:18:59] will have a seed
[1:19:01] everybody okay now everybody okay now so
[1:19:05] the woman that will have a seed is a
[1:19:09] woman that will give birth to Jesus
[1:19:11] Christ because Paul said in Galatians 3
[1:19:14] that Abraham and his seed won not many
[1:19:19] ganation three you know the scripture
[1:19:22] everybody okay what does it mean a seed
[1:19:26] of a woman
[1:19:30] everybody okay
[1:19:32] the seed of a woman does not mean that a
[1:19:36] woman have a sperm
[1:19:39] [Music]
[1:19:42] everybody okay
[1:19:43] the seed of a woman needs that
[1:19:47] the woman has a pregnancy
[1:19:51] that has nothing to do with sex
[1:19:59] [Applause]
[1:20:04] the woman has a pregnancy that is not
[1:20:08] connected to any masculine
[1:20:13] [Music]
[1:20:20] foreign
[1:20:23] Luke chapter one
[1:20:25] [Laughter]
[1:20:28] oh my God
[1:20:31] oh my God Lord help me I don't know why
[1:20:35] this went back
[1:20:39] we already went through this
[1:20:44] we already went through this we already
[1:20:46] went through this we already went
[1:20:48] through this we are here okay brother
[1:20:51] pradam say that that woman in journalist
[1:20:54] in Revelation 12 that was a virgin woman
[1:20:57] how did Brother Branham know
[1:20:59] now you begin to see the description
[1:21:02] amen you begin to see she was a real
[1:21:05] lady how beautiful she stood
[1:21:08] now
[1:21:10] glory to God
[1:21:12] the Bible says this in Isaiah before we
[1:21:15] get to look
[1:21:16] therefore the Lord himself shall give
[1:21:20] you a water
[1:21:26] the Lord himself shall give you a water
[1:21:30] sign
[1:21:33] everybody okay
[1:21:34] and behold the water version shall water
[1:21:38] in either way the woman will have a seed
[1:21:42] will have a baby but that baby will be
[1:21:45] by a virgin woman
[1:21:47] thank God he happened back in the day
[1:21:52] because if it would happen today
[1:21:54] somebody would say they did in vitro
[1:22:00] so God made sure it happened before your
[1:22:03] technology
[1:22:07] everybody okay and then the Bible says
[1:22:10] Behold a virgin shall do what you can
[1:22:12] see and bury Waters and his shall call
[1:22:15] his name who Emmanuel
[1:22:19] behold Matthew a virgin shall be with
[1:22:23] child and shall bring forth a water son
[1:22:26] and they shall call his name who
[1:22:29] amen which being interpreted which being
[1:22:32] interpreted is what god with us so this
[1:22:36] child is God
[1:22:41] everybody okay that's why he was caught
[1:22:44] up to God and he can go to the throne of
[1:22:48] God because he's God and he can rule all
[1:22:51] the nation because he's God
[1:22:55] everybody okay
[1:22:57] the Bible say here unto us a water is
[1:23:01] born unto us a water and the government
[1:23:04] shall be upon his shoulder his name
[1:23:07] shall be covered wonderful and water
[1:23:09] counselor and the water Mighty God and
[1:23:12] everlasting water father
[1:23:14] foreign
[1:23:15] let's go to Luke chapter one
[1:23:20] I still have some minutes so chill out
[1:23:22] I'm gonna run
[1:23:25] Luke chapter one if you're there you can
[1:23:27] say Amen
[1:23:29] job 2 verse 26.
[1:23:32] amen
[1:23:34] and the sixth month
[1:23:36] Diego capria was sent to God to a city
[1:23:38] of Galilee named Nazareth to a water
[1:23:41] version it's passed to her whose name
[1:23:44] was what Joseph and the house of the
[1:23:47] House of David and the Virgin name was
[1:23:49] who Mary everybody clear job to verse
[1:23:52] 30.
[1:23:53] and the angel said to her fear not Mary
[1:23:56] for you have found favor with God and
[1:23:59] Beyond you shall conceive in your and
[1:24:02] bring forth a Waters and shall call his
[1:24:05] name who Jesus he shall be great
[1:24:08] and shall be called the son of the
[1:24:10] highest and the Lord God shall give him
[1:24:12] the Throne of his father David and he
[1:24:15] shall reign over the house of Jacob
[1:24:16] forever and his kingdom shall be
[1:24:19] because he doesn't have a beginning
[1:24:22] then send Mary to the angel how shall
[1:24:26] this be saying I know what so the woman
[1:24:30] is questioning God through the angel
[1:24:32] that you're trying to tell me I'm going
[1:24:34] to give a pregnancy but how can I have a
[1:24:38] pregnancy without a man
[1:24:41] how can a woman have a seed
[1:24:46] without a man
[1:24:48] so the woman said means that the woman
[1:24:51] has a seat that had not that did not
[1:24:54] originate from a man
[1:24:59] everybody okay immaculate
[1:25:04] everybody okay
[1:25:05] verse 35 and the angel answered and said
[1:25:09] to her the water Holy Ghost shall do
[1:25:12] water come over thee and the power of
[1:25:15] highest salty water
[1:25:16] therefore also die holy thing the only
[1:25:21] conception that Holy thing
[1:25:23] which shall be born of you shall be
[1:25:26] called The Waters so the seed that Mary
[1:25:30] conceive was a seed that came from the
[1:25:34] Holy Ghost
[1:25:40] it is not a human being that did it
[1:25:43] open Matthew chapter one
[1:25:47] glory to God
[1:25:49] [Music]
[1:25:51] if you dare you can say Amen Matthew
[1:25:53] chapter 1 verse 20.
[1:25:56] you there but why he thought on this
[1:26:00] thing behold the angel of the Lord
[1:26:02] appeared to him in a dream saying Joseph
[1:26:04] you son of David feel not to take hope
[1:26:08] Mary for that which is conceived
[1:26:12] in here is of the water so who's the
[1:26:15] father of Jesus Christ Holy Ghost
[1:26:21] you think the Holy Ghost makes sense
[1:26:26] people out of their mind
[1:26:30] and she shall be brought and she shall
[1:26:34] bring forth a water son and you shall
[1:26:37] call his name who Jesus for he shall
[1:26:39] save his people from their sin everybody
[1:26:41] okay
[1:26:44] verse uh
[1:26:46] 23 behold the Virgin shall be with a
[1:26:49] child and shall have bring forth his son
[1:26:52] and they shall call his name Emmanuel
[1:26:53] which being interpreted is God With Us
[1:26:56] watch carefully then Joseph being raised
[1:26:59] from what sleep did as the angel of the
[1:27:02] Lord has Biden him and took to him his
[1:27:05] water why so Joseph was United by God
[1:27:12] let me continue watch verse 25.
[1:27:16] and know her in other words Joseph
[1:27:20] didn't have any sexual relationship with
[1:27:24] Mary why because the seed is the seed of
[1:27:29] the water God did not even allow Joseph
[1:27:33] to touch Mary until the child is born to
[1:27:38] make sure no man claim anything
[1:27:43] I think
[1:27:45] there is a question and an answer right
[1:27:48] there for young couple I leave it alone
[1:27:52] I'm not going to touch it everybody okay
[1:27:54] and no her not nobody asked me that
[1:27:57] there is a question and there is an
[1:27:59] answer right there I just saw it and no
[1:28:02] and no her not until she had brought
[1:28:05] forth the first song and he called his
[1:28:07] name who Jesus so the woman the seed of
[1:28:11] a woman it means that there is no
[1:28:13] interaction between the man and the
[1:28:17] woman it's a seed that is completely
[1:28:19] created by God himself
[1:28:24] amen that's why the woman shall have a
[1:28:27] seed how a virgin shall conceal how can
[1:28:30] a virgin conceive if she will conceive
[1:28:32] of the Holy Spirit and when she got that
[1:28:35] conception no man will touch her until
[1:28:38] the baby is delivered to make sure no
[1:28:42] man claim anything on my Redemption
[1:28:45] [Applause]
[1:28:45] [Music]
[1:28:47] my Redemption from start to finish
[1:28:50] belong to God himself
[1:28:53] [Applause]
[1:28:56] thank you
[1:28:58] everybody okay everybody okay now this
[1:29:02] is the way Jesus Christ was born who in
[1:29:05] this place was born by a virgin birth
[1:29:08] none of you
[1:29:11] that's your difference
[1:29:13] what is our similarities

[1:29:58] suffering of death I'm still good in

[1:33:54] responsibility to clean you up and he
[1:33:58] does sanctified and the one that has
[1:34:00] been Sanctified both of them are one
[1:34:05] [Applause]

[1:35:08] oh I hope you are getting this
[1:35:13] Jesus Christ
[1:35:15] jump to verse 14. Lord help me where am
[1:35:19] I at
[1:35:20] e job to verse 14. the Bible says for as
[1:35:24] much then as the children are partaking
[1:35:27] of water the flesh because you became
[1:35:30] human
[1:35:33] amen he also himself likewise took water
[1:35:37] all of the same you made my wife human
[1:35:41] how can I remain a spirit I must be
[1:35:44] human too I'm gonna follow my wife
[1:35:49] everybody okay
[1:35:51] and that through death he might destroy
[1:35:55] him that had power of what that is who
[1:35:58] the job to verse 16. for verily he took
[1:36:02] note on him the nature of water because
[1:36:05] you were not an angel
[1:36:06] so he cannot match the angel they are
[1:36:09] not part of that Redemption amen but he
[1:36:12] took on the seed of water Abraham that's
[1:36:15] why he came as a Jew
[1:36:17] because the promise was given to any to
[1:36:19] Abraham if the promise was given to
[1:36:22] America he would come as an American
[1:36:24] so he have to trust the word and follow
[1:36:27] the word everybody okay wherefore
[1:36:30] in all things he be here for him to be
[1:36:34] made like water his brother in
[1:36:37] everything
[1:36:39] I don't know if you're catching that I'm
[1:36:40] talking about the similarities between
[1:36:43] you and Jesus Christ in the flesh
[1:36:47] So In the Flesh the way you are that's
[1:36:50] exactly how Jesus was
[1:36:54] if you have had that Jesus have had it
[1:36:58] all right
[1:37:00] if you are crying one time for being
[1:37:03] rejected Jesus understands that very
[1:37:05] well
[1:37:09] Jesus Christ that he be made like his
[1:37:12] water Brethren that he might be how
[1:37:16] my brother let's go merciful and water
[1:37:18] faithful High priests in six will turn
[1:37:21] into water God
[1:37:23] to make water
[1:37:25] for the sins of water people so in the
[1:37:28] body everything he looks like him
[1:37:33] hey everybody okay what is the
[1:37:36] difference in the body between you and
[1:37:38] him because we found out that he
[1:37:41] participate in flesh and blood
[1:37:43] you remember and we also by the cross
[1:37:47] what came
[1:37:48] water and blood and he also came from
[1:37:51] with water and blood everybody okay and
[1:37:53] if you know this Jesus came out of a
[1:37:56] woman
[1:38:00] everybody okay everybody okay in the
[1:38:04] body Jesus Paul says that he became
[1:38:08] exactly like us
[1:38:11] amen and in the body Jesus had a mother
[1:38:17] that took care of him me and you had a
[1:38:20] mother
[1:38:22] anybody okay Jesus also had the father
[1:38:27] of him
[1:38:28] we also have a father
[1:38:31] everybody okay Jesus came with water and
[1:38:34] blood that's what face John said we also
[1:38:38] came with water and blood
[1:38:40] amen what is our differences
[1:38:43] so in the body Jesus is male and female
[1:38:47] just like Adam
[1:38:49] amen now we understand now that the
[1:38:53] creation of Jesus Christ came from a
[1:38:55] virgin birth
[1:38:57] the seed of the woman and he came out
[1:39:00] now we need to find how did the Bride
[1:39:03] come out
[1:39:05] and then I might have to learn that I
[1:39:06] can't reach where I was going
[1:39:08] amen come on
[1:39:11] if you notice when we spoke about Adam
[1:39:14] we found out that Adam never see
[1:39:17] oh never Adam was not deceived but Adam
[1:39:21] willfully sinned because he loved his
[1:39:24] wife let's see how Jesus also was
[1:39:30] everybody okay
[1:39:31] if you're tired you say stop we pick up
[1:39:34] on Sunday then whatever was meant to
[1:39:36] Sunday we push it another time okay he
[1:39:39] made his grave with the water Wicked and
[1:39:42] with the rich in his water because he
[1:39:45] has done no water violence means there
[1:39:47] was any water found in his water
[1:39:53] which of you can convince me of what sin
[1:39:57] nobody could convince Jesus of sin
[1:39:59] because Adam nobody could touch him he
[1:40:02] was original
[1:40:04] everybody okay
[1:40:06] John 19 pilate therefore went forth
[1:40:10] again and said unto them behold I bring
[1:40:12] him forth to you that he may know that I
[1:40:15] found water even his enemy
[1:40:21] could not find the fault against him
[1:40:25] everybody okay
[1:40:27] the Bible said and the other answering
[1:40:30] rebuke him saying does not feel good
[1:40:33] seeing that out in the same condemnation
[1:40:35] and we indiciously for we receive the do
[1:40:39] reward of deed but this man had done
[1:40:42] what even
[1:40:44] I mean a thief recognize that Jesus was
[1:40:48] guiltyless
[1:40:51] everybody okay
[1:40:53] glory to God Paul says for we have not a
[1:40:57] high priest which cannot be touched with
[1:41:00] the feeling of our water but with but
[1:41:03] once in water our points tempted like
[1:41:06] what we are yet without water
[1:41:11] because Adam was not deceived
[1:41:14] let them willfully
[1:41:16] took the deception and sin to save him
[1:41:22] everybody okay
[1:41:24] but with the Precious Blood of who
[1:41:27] Christ I said lamb without water blemish
[1:41:30] and water spots
[1:41:35] first Peter for even here unto where we
[1:41:39] where you call because Christ also
[1:41:41] suffered for us leaving us here an
[1:41:43] example that you should follow his water
[1:41:46] who did not say neither was water God
[1:41:50] found in his water mouth I'm reproducing
[1:41:53] the last Adam
[1:41:54] everybody okay where are you going
[1:41:57] brother Branham
[1:41:59] the misunderstanding was they thought I
[1:42:03] said that Adam never sinned
[1:42:06] the one who attacked brother Branham
[1:42:08] doesn't read this quote
[1:42:12] just wanna blabber on it
[1:42:14] but Adam did Sin but he did it with his
[1:42:19] eyes wide open
[1:42:23] everybody okay that
[1:42:25] that they brought Jesus Christ cup he
[1:42:28] knew what the company
[1:42:30] he said father
[1:42:32] take this cup away
[1:42:34] nevertheless
[1:42:36] not water but water your will
[1:42:41] fully everybody okay brother Branham say
[1:42:44] intimate tree he said that Adam was not
[1:42:47] deceived but the woman being deceived
[1:42:49] was in the water see if actually thought
[1:42:53] she was right
[1:42:55] but Satan did whatever
[1:42:57] her but he didn't deceive Adam he knew
[1:43:00] he wasn't wow but because of love for
[1:43:04] his water why he represented himself
[1:43:07] with water and was condemned by water
[1:43:10] the same and cast out of the water and
[1:43:13] cross-represented himself with the
[1:43:16] church full of sin and was condemned and
[1:43:20] he saw one too hell that's why God
[1:43:22] raised him up on the third day he was
[1:43:25] not him it was not that he didn't sin he
[1:43:28] did what he said
[1:43:30] all right
[1:43:34] so he has made him to be seen for us who
[1:43:40] want them you know that we might be made
[1:43:43] the water righteousness of God in him
[1:43:48] so Jesus purposely with eyes open like
[1:43:53] Adam also took your sin upon him
[1:43:58] because of the love
[1:43:59] [Applause]
[1:44:02] everybody okay we talking about the
[1:44:05] first Adam for his wife now the last
[1:44:08] Adam with his wife we had similarities
[1:44:11] but the only difference is he is born
[1:44:14] without sex
[1:44:17] we are born with water what does he mean
[1:44:20] for us
[1:44:24] let me skip this we already got it amen
[1:44:27] but upon them say he permits it as I
[1:44:30] said but he will not he will not let it
[1:44:33] be his what perfect will but he shall
[1:44:35] make it work to honor and bless his
[1:44:37] water and child bearing by sex is what
[1:44:44] so bringing children by sex is not God
[1:44:48] perfectly
[1:44:51] because at the beginning Adam was
[1:44:53] created
[1:44:55] from the Dust it is a permissive way
[1:44:59] brother Branham said this and he showed
[1:45:02] here in the beginning that his perfect
[1:45:04] will was to create man out of the water
[1:45:07] dust of the Earth but you see he
[1:45:10] permitted
[1:45:11] to be brought in he never did intend
[1:45:14] children to be born by what sex but it
[1:45:17] was water permitted which soon were
[1:45:19] water fade away
[1:45:24] my subject today was the byproduct in in
[1:45:29] top for the last Adam now don't you see
[1:45:33] the great picture
[1:45:36] we in water flesh our water different we
[1:45:40] are like a water by father created by
[1:45:43] water holy
[1:45:45] just like Eve was a byproduct on the
[1:45:49] flesh
[1:45:51] we okay we also are byproduct in type
[1:45:57] because of sex
[1:46:02] that's why he could not fall
[1:46:07] he could not sin
[1:46:09] but we are failing because David said in
[1:46:14] Psalm 51 that we are shaping iniquity
[1:46:20] everybody okay we are ship born in sins
[1:46:23] shape in water do you know the scripture
[1:46:26] Psalm 51 coming into the world doing
[1:46:28] water speaking love nobody have to teach
[1:46:31] you that is our byproduct
[1:46:36] if we were born virgin birth like Jesus
[1:46:40] Christ none of us were sinned
[1:46:44] but we are not born by virgin person we
[1:46:47] are born by the perversion of sex that's
[1:46:51] why we are doomed to fall
[1:46:55] by product of the first Adam doomed to
[1:46:58] Fall by product of the second Adam
[1:47:00] doomed to fall
[1:47:04] everybody okay
[1:47:07] brother Branham say but in what spirit
[1:47:11] in Genesis 1 26 we are Waters Sons and
[1:47:15] Daughters not some other Spirit but the
[1:47:18] spirit of what the water Perfect Image
[1:47:20] because we become sons and Waters
[1:47:24] Genesis 1 26 not separated by The Same
[1:47:28] Spirit the same God the same person
[1:47:35] Eternal to the Eternal see how God
[1:47:37] planted that we should be not the
[1:47:40] different but be him
[1:47:52] now the body comes from mother and
[1:47:55] father Genesis 2 7 this is our thy
[1:47:59] product but the spirit came from who God
[1:48:02] God separating himself as Adam was what
[1:48:05] separated
[1:48:09] everybody okay
[1:48:13] brother Branham said how can it take how
[1:48:16] can I take a cockroach and make a grain
[1:48:19] of wheat out of it
[1:48:21] it is water impossible for me to do it
[1:48:24] the only way it can be is because he
[1:48:28] said that has been transmitted from her
[1:48:32] a Coco bear to a germ called what
[1:48:34] brother Branham say if you have a
[1:48:37] genuine 100 of it here 100
[1:48:42] inside 100 percent there is no way you
[1:48:46] can take this and make it a wheat
[1:48:48] it's not going to happen brother Branham
[1:48:50] said the only way you can make a cocoa
[1:48:53] bear a wheat
[1:48:54] anybody okay when they buy product
[1:48:59] of the second Adam by sex produce a
[1:49:04] wrong nature of a crocodile's 100
[1:49:08] on the inside of that cocoa bear God
[1:49:12] will put a witchcraft
[1:49:14] [Music]
[1:49:15] out
[1:49:22] [Applause]
[1:49:30] he said then you barely die Cracker
[1:49:34] Barrel if you look you look like a
[1:49:35] Cocker bear amen and he shall produce a
[1:49:39] grain of water we because there has been
[1:49:41] a life of wheat put in there and the
[1:49:45] life of the cocoa bear has been what
[1:49:47] taken out but the nature of the cocoa
[1:49:49] bear on the outside is still water
[1:49:51] sticky
[1:49:52] and it will be until this new life has
[1:49:55] water fully being fully being developed
[1:49:59] up here again when it comes forth then
[1:50:02] it is normal
[1:50:04] 100 water but while it is here on Earth
[1:50:08] and a Cocker there is still water sticky
[1:50:11] but it's got the nature on the inside of
[1:50:14] it of water wheat
[1:50:18] and as long as you are in this life you
[1:50:24] are going to be
[1:50:25] and have a water oh no nature
[1:50:28] that your byproduct that is going to do
[1:50:32] whatever bother you as long as you but
[1:50:36] inside of you
[1:50:37] Genesis 1 26.
[1:50:40] inside of you you are water born again
[1:50:43] and when you rise up you are in there
[1:50:46] likeness of who Christ and all the sin
[1:50:50] has water God
[1:50:51] that is the thing
[1:50:55] everybody okay everybody okay that's why
[1:50:59] this happened on Sunset Mountain
[1:51:04] everybody okay brother Brandon said that
[1:51:07] was taught me on one morning and what
[1:51:09] time 10 o'clock standing in my room in
[1:51:12] water
[1:51:13] told me I will be away
[1:51:15] yes
[1:51:27] why are you cockable
[1:51:28] I will picking up a Cocker bear what do
[1:51:32] we call there a water
[1:51:34] why I gotten brother Branham is calling
[1:51:37] this cocoa bear is very specific
[1:51:40] this kookaburra is not just any
[1:51:43] kookaburra but it is a goat head
[1:51:48] amen because if you look at the goat
[1:51:51] hair
[1:51:52] it's a cookie bear that have the head of
[1:51:54] a goat
[1:51:56] it looks like this
[1:52:01] and it's a cockerman that's why they
[1:52:04] call that a goat head
[1:52:06] and God taught brother Bradham when
[1:52:09] you're going to Tucson before I come and
[1:52:13] bring the blast of this Heavens here
[1:52:16] you will find on your pet
[1:52:19] a crocodile that looked like a good
[1:52:25] everybody okay he said what they call a
[1:52:29] goat header off of my water
[1:52:31] then and seven angel came and did what
[1:52:35] besties and Grand bastard and everything
[1:52:38] and rolled out the mountain and the
[1:52:41] Seven Angels did what
[1:52:43] have a connection between the seven
[1:52:46] Angel and the cockery
[1:52:50] everybody okay number one a goat in the
[1:52:54] Bible represents him
[1:52:56] that's why Satan is to who uses the head
[1:53:00] of a goat
[1:53:01] that's why they came up with acronym
[1:53:04] calling the greatest of all time they're
[1:53:07] not saying the greatest of all time they
[1:53:10] are calling themselves God which is a
[1:53:12] representative of Lucifer so young
[1:53:15] people be careful what you're picking up
[1:53:17] on the internet you find yourself
[1:53:19] worshiping the devil
[1:53:23] foreign
[1:53:28] [Applause]
[1:53:31] when I'm coming for full Redemption
[1:53:35] make sure there is a Cocker bear
[1:53:38] like a goat head it's gonna be sticky to
[1:53:42] your pants telling you that I'm coming
[1:53:44] to bring complete Redemption the things
[1:53:48] that have gone at the church for so long
[1:53:51] now we don't only have the Redemption of
[1:53:55] our soul but sooner we're gonna have the
[1:53:58] changes of our body our body will be
[1:54:02] changed and the sin on our body will
[1:54:04] come out and go back to hell that's why
[1:54:08] you must have a cocoa bear as a
[1:54:10] representation over there everybody okay
[1:54:13] everybody okay let's stop here let's
[1:54:16] stand
[1:54:18] [Applause]
[1:54:19] because if I keep moving they sell more
[1:54:22] here
[1:54:28] [Music]
[1:54:33] my God
[1:54:37] they sell a lot
[1:54:39] that we need to be delivered
[1:54:42] amen
[1:54:43] suck this
[1:54:45] I have to pick it up again on Sunday
[1:54:48] there is some more here that you need to
[1:54:50] get everybody okay
[1:54:52] everybody okay we are by product
[1:54:55] in top
[1:54:57] because we came from the side of him on
[1:55:00] the cross
[1:55:01] but when his side was pierced none of
[1:55:04] you were born
[1:55:06] the blood came
[1:55:08] the water came but you were not born yet
[1:55:11] so in tap you were representative
[1:55:14] amen so obsess the first Adam wife was a
[1:55:19] byproduct the second wife of the second
[1:55:21] Adam must be also by product you become
[1:55:25] a byproduct by your sexual act
[1:55:30] that's what brings you a wrong nature
[1:55:32] that's why Ephesians 2 Say by Nature we
[1:55:35] were children of Disobedience but the
[1:55:37] God who is rich in Mercy while we were
[1:55:40] yet
[1:55:41] because he was not looking at the Cocker
[1:55:44] bear inside of you there was a wheat
[1:55:46] bread while you were yet sinner Christ
[1:55:49] already looked inside he said that's my
[1:55:51] song
[1:55:52] amen I'm not worrying about what is on
[1:55:54] the outside it is my responsibility to
[1:55:57] wash her to clean her by the washing of
[1:56:00] the word so that I can present to myself
[1:56:03] a church without spot or wrinkle spot is
[1:56:07] seen wrinkle is the body I need to
[1:56:11] present a church with a sin on Genesis 1
[1:56:14] 26 and with a wrinkle on Genesis 2 7.
[1:56:20] with that spot Genesis 1 26 the Inside
[1:56:23] Man and with that wrinkle your body
[1:56:26] needs to become young Genesis 2 7 that's
[1:56:29] why the angel came down to bring full
[1:56:32] Redemption so that we receive a message
[1:56:34] that will change our body
[1:56:41] that's why marriage cannot happen at the
[1:56:43] beginning of Paul you have to be
[1:56:45] happening down and in town let's pray
[1:56:48] Heavenly Father Lord we are approaching
[1:56:50] you again humbly tonight father thanking
[1:56:53] you for your grace for your love your
[1:56:55] mercy father and for helping us tonight
[1:56:58] despite the fight of the devil lord
[1:57:01] plainly we can see why the devil was
[1:57:04] fighting but Lord father we have gained
[1:57:07] the victory tonight we have won it Lord
[1:57:09] and you had your word being delivered to
[1:57:12] your children and this word you spoke in
[1:57:14] your word that when you send it it is
[1:57:16] for the healing it will heal it will
[1:57:19] never return void unto you but
[1:57:21] everywhere there is a predestinated seed
[1:57:23] the helping Lord father bury in the Coco
[1:57:26] bear whether it's in this church or
[1:57:29] those that will be streaming or
[1:57:31] streaming elsewhere father that
[1:57:33] predestinated seed will be quickened by
[1:57:36] the order of this word oh God we
[1:57:39] understand now where we're coming from
[1:57:41] that father we are no other creature but
[1:57:45] you in the feminine version and Lord
[1:57:47] father may you take these words that has
[1:57:50] been preached tonight may you Quicken
[1:57:52] them may you bring more Revelation so
[1:57:55] that the people can realize who called
[1:57:58] them
[1:57:59] what is the purpose of them being
[1:58:02] brought in this Center what are you
[1:58:05] really trying to get when the world is
[1:58:07] completely in chaos when Lord father the
[1:58:10] King of the North is Raging where
[1:58:13] America is Raging where Lord father the
[1:58:16] world is going to chaos the stock market
[1:58:19] completely down father the people don't
[1:58:22] know what is on tomorrow but father you
[1:58:24] told us to lift up our head because our
[1:58:27] Redemption and who speak about
[1:58:29] Redemption is talking about marriage our
[1:58:32] marriage is drawing thy Lord father just
[1:58:35] like Rebecca has to be brought from a
[1:58:38] foreign land and brought back all the
[1:58:40] way to the land of Isaac and further
[1:58:42] between Rebecca and Isaac there was a
[1:58:45] blood relationship they didn't just
[1:58:48] marry like that that's why Abraham sent
[1:58:51] him to his own family to make sure they
[1:58:54] get the one that is bloody related with
[1:58:56] Isaac and we are also blood related with
[1:59:00] you that's why you are coming down on
[1:59:02] this end time to hunt that Brad with the
[1:59:05] message of eliasm Father hunting the
[1:59:08] bread where it is to tell her that we
[1:59:11] are blood related we came from the same
[1:59:14] father from the same Source from the
[1:59:17] same Garden even though we have
[1:59:19] similarities it doesn't matter
[1:59:21] Redemption has opened up to bring us
[1:59:24] back to our original position father may
[1:59:27] you continue to unfold this mystery to
[1:59:30] your children bring them to a full
[1:59:32] Consecration and Lord father thank you
[1:59:34] for helping us tonight may you give them
[1:59:36] travel mercy and strengthen our body and
[1:59:39] be with us as we commit everything unto
[1:59:41] their hand touch those that are sick and
[1:59:44] struggling in the body with this flu
[1:59:46] that has been left and right but father
[1:59:48] we pray that your grace be upon them
[1:59:51] Lord and may you manifest yourself Lord
[1:59:54] expressing yourself in your love Lord
