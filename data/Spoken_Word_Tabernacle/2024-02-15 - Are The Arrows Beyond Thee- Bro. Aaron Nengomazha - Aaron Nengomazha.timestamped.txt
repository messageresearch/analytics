[31:07] amen God bless you
[31:09] Saints good to be in the house of the
[31:11] Lord tonight um I just wanted to mention
[31:14] two things um first uh the young lady
[31:17] that was here um sister Ruth um we had
[31:20] fellowship with her and I felt that it
[31:22] would be um good to share not only with
[31:24] the sisters but with the church that she
[31:27] said to me multiple times during her
[31:28] stay that this has been a real blessing
[31:30] to her and that she really really
[31:32] appreciated the the fellowship and that
[31:35] um all the sisters were very encouraged
[31:37] with the conversation everything so just
[31:39] know that you're being lights to the
[31:40] world
[31:42] um and then also I just want to say um
[31:46] today I struggled in a very weird way um
[31:50] I think it was a spiritual attack based
[31:52] off of just not having a reason for the
[31:54] way I was feeling and all I could think
[31:56] is I know this is the devil I knew it
[31:58] was him and I knew I was supposed to
[32:00] sing this song tonight and I wasn't
[32:02] feeling well all day so I said okay I
[32:04] said I'm going to sing this for the
[32:05] glory of God so this is a personal song
[32:07] to my savior tonight but I pray it'll be
[32:10] a blessing to
[32:16] [Music]
[32:26] you
[32:33] because of who you are I give you
[32:43] glory because of who you are I give you

[53:55] and he says my brother Your Love
[53:58] exceeded the love of women that's
[54:00] exactly right Hallelujah sir amen
[54:04] because the Bible says that Jonathan's
[54:07] heart and and and David they were so

[56:19] repent at 15 years old we baptize them
[56:22] yes my brother Hallelujah preach my
[56:24] brother because God works with people
[56:27] based upon their hearts yes my brother

[56:52] old that's exactly right the enemy does
[56:54] not care about your age no sir he's not
[56:57] going to say you know what I'm going to
[56:58] attack the older ones this one is so
[57:00] young let me just leave him for a little
[57:02] bit the devil does not do that no sir
[57:05] Billy Paul smoked his first cigarette he
[57:07] was about 13 14 years old the devil does
[57:11] not care that's why you must bring your
[57:13] children to church because we have to
[57:16] catch them young yes my brother yes sir
[57:20] yes my brother the people that change
[57:22] the world are not necessarily very very
[57:25] old people uh-uh they're very very young
[57:27] amen Marilyn mroe was very young Elvis
[57:31] Presley was very very young Michael
[57:34] Jackson was very young right now I was
[57:37] reading there's this lady called Taylor
[57:39] Swift some of you might not know her
[57:41] because I know that I'm I'm preaching to
[57:44] very very spiritual
[57:48] people when she comes to town There's an
[57:51] earthquake and she's about 32 33 years
[57:54] old I said if the world can take a
[57:57] person and use it to such an extent how
[58:01] much more can God do with a young man
[58:05] and a young woman who fully surrendered
[58:07] unto
[58:08] [Applause]
[58:10] sh Hallelujah so God wants to use the
[58:14] young people God wants to use the old
[58:16] people God will work with what soever is
[58:19] given unto
[58:20] [Music]
[58:21] him because remember salvation yes sir
[58:26] and
[58:26] adoption are two different
[58:30] things
[58:31] Hallelujah because remember we shall
[58:34] receive a crown and we shall receive we
[58:37] shall go to judgment to receive our
[58:39] reward based on what we did how many
[58:43] knows that the prophet talks about the
[58:45] recording Angel and he says I had a
[58:47] dream I was walking the ivory steps and
[58:50] there was a recording angel that was
[58:52] calling people's names to receive a
[58:56] reward Hallelujah so a reward is based
[58:59] on what you do for the
[59:02] Lord praise be to God when you come for
[59:05] service the recording Angel is putting
[59:08] that in the book when you are singing a
[59:10] special song the recording Angel is
[59:13] putting that in the book and you receive
[59:15] a blessing according to your
[59:18] [Music]
[59:18] [Applause]
[59:20] conduct the pastor might not see you but
[59:23] the recording angels sees you your
[59:26] neighbor may not sees you but the
[59:28] recording angel will sees you that's why
[59:31] the Bible says you servants obey your
[59:34] masters and work as if you are working
[59:37] unto the Lord because even if the master
[59:40] does not see what you're doing the
[59:42] recording angel will pick it
[59:48] up and obey your husband is unto the
[59:52] Lord say oh brother Aaron he doesn't he
[59:54] doesn't he doesn't even appreciate the
[59:56] recording angel will see
[1:00:02] it so now David was anointed at a very
[1:00:07] young very very young age and when you
[1:00:09] are anointed that's when trouble starts
[1:00:12] some people feel like well when I come
[1:00:13] to the message everything is going to be
[1:00:15] all right that's a lie when you come to
[1:00:18] Christ that's the when the battle starts
[1:00:21] when you make a decision that's when the
[1:00:23] fight begins
[1:00:26] and you will see that the most spiritual
[1:00:29] time of David's life sir when when he
[1:00:32] was running away from sa when he was in
[1:00:35] the palace he was a very very kindal man
[1:00:38] there were no there were not great many
[1:00:40] exploits that David did when he was in
[1:00:43] the palace a lot of the Psalms were
[1:00:46] written when he was running away from
[1:00:48] Saul and many testimonies they come when
[1:00:51] you are going through
[1:00:53] situations
[1:00:56] glory be to
[1:00:57] God some of the most special moments in
[1:01:01] your marriage are not when everything is
[1:01:03] all right it's the days when you have to
[1:01:06] share a sandwich hallelujah it's the
[1:01:10] days when you have to share the same car
[1:01:13] those are the most spiritual days of
[1:01:14] your marriage when you are living in a
[1:01:17] one-bedroom apartment and you are
[1:01:19] sharing
[1:01:21] everything
[1:01:23] Hallelujah that's when the anointing
[1:01:25] comes and you say the Lord is my
[1:01:28] shepherd I shall not
[1:01:30] [Applause]
[1:01:37] want you say brother Aon I'm going

[1:02:06] artificial
[1:02:08] tears I'm going to write for you
[1:02:10] artificial tears and you buy these eye
[1:02:13] drops once in a while put it in your
[1:02:15] eyes because you see your body the eyes
[1:02:18] they need for the natural it's a natural
[1:02:21] uh disposition for you to
[1:02:23] cry and then the Holy Ghost begin to
[1:02:25] work on me and I said you know what
[1:02:28] crying is not actually bad it's it's
[1:02:31] scriptural as long as you not crying
[1:02:33] unto men but if you are crying unto the
[1:02:36] Lord you are in the
[1:02:39] [Applause]
[1:02:40] scriptures because David how many times
[1:02:43] do we did the Bible and David says this
[1:02:47] poor man cried this poor man cried and I
[1:02:50] cried unto the Lord I said you know what
[1:02:53] I'm going to cry out unto the
[1:02:55] Lord this Poorman cried and the Lord
[1:02:58] hurt him praise be to God but our
[1:03:02] problem is we cry to our neighbors we
[1:03:05] cry to the government we cry to the
[1:03:08] people you must cry out unto the
[1:03:11] [Applause]
[1:03:15] Lord
[1:03:17] hallelujah so David sir was
[1:03:20] anointed but as soon as he he was
[1:03:23] anointed God God chased him away and
[1:03:27] David was hoping that you know what
[1:03:29] maybe Saul would come back to his
[1:03:31] senses but you know what this was the
[1:03:33] work of the Lord and sa was not going to
[1:03:37] come to his
[1:03:38] senses hallelujah amen so when David was
[1:03:42] anointed and Saul wanted to kill David
[1:03:45] it was not because of David but it was
[1:03:48] because of the anointing that was upon
[1:03:52] David and the reason why why people hate
[1:03:55] the Jews it's not because of how they
[1:03:57] look it's not because of what they do
[1:04:00] it's because of God's
[1:04:02] election and the reason why the bride
[1:04:05] will be hated is because of the
[1:04:10] anointing that is why if you love Christ
[1:04:14] there's no way the world will love you
[1:04:16] the world will not love you because
[1:04:19] Christ said if they hated me they shall
[1:04:21] hate me if they can do this to the to
[1:04:24] the Master how much more shall they do
[1:04:26] un the
[1:04:28] servants praise be to God so David was
[1:04:32] hoping that maybe per Adventure
[1:04:35] something was going to happen and then
[1:04:38] maybe Saul would come back to his senses
[1:04:41] and he said okay Jonathan you go to the
[1:04:44] dinner with my father when you go to the
[1:04:47] dinner see his reaction just see if if
[1:04:51] if if he's willing for me to come back
[1:04:54] right let's let's just find out if if if
[1:04:57] they will allow me to come back right
[1:04:59] there are situations where sometimes you
[1:05:01] feel like well will I ever be accepted
[1:05:04] in that church again will I will will my
[1:05:07] parents ever accept me again I've been
[1:05:10] away from home I've back siden it's
[1:05:13] questions that come in a person's mind
[1:05:15] oh if I go back to my husband will he
[1:05:18] accept my apology if I go back to my
[1:05:21] family so so so David take spoke with
[1:05:26] Jonathan and and Jonathan says this
[1:05:29] shall be the
[1:05:30] sign I will see if my daddy wants you to
[1:05:34] come back I will shoot the arrow and if
[1:05:37] I say the arrow is near then you you
[1:05:40] free to come back that's exactly but if
[1:05:43] I say the arrow is far from thee then
[1:05:46] you have to run away that's exactly
[1:05:48] right how many knows the story then you
[1:05:51] have to run away so naturally David
[1:05:54] being a man that was anointed by God he
[1:05:58] must have thought you know what I think
[1:05:59] God is going to fight for me God is
[1:06:02] going to change the heart of Saul God is
[1:06:05] going to change the situation you know
[1:06:07] what I am bright everything is going to
[1:06:10] change I'm going to speak the word and
[1:06:12] the Miracle will
[1:06:14] happen but sometimes God's ways are past
[1:06:18] our
[1:06:19] [Applause]
[1:06:21] ways and God's ways are past finding
[1:06:24] out
[1:06:27] Hallelujah so when when Jonathan went to
[1:06:30] the feast so was saying where is David
[1:06:34] and he was in Rage and he was taking the
[1:06:37] the spear wanted to kill Jonathan say
[1:06:39] you have conspired with the son of Jesse
[1:06:42] and I love how the Bible always mentions
[1:06:46] the son of Jesse the son of Jess because
[1:06:50] you know what David could not have been
[1:06:53] a great man
[1:06:54] if he had not had a grand
[1:06:58] father because remember when God made
[1:07:01] the coving with Abraham he said I know
[1:07:05] Abraham that he shall teach his children
[1:07:08] the word of
[1:07:11] God so Jesse was a great man and Jesse
[1:07:16] would SE his children at evening and say
[1:07:19] I'm going to read you a Bible story God
[1:07:22] came down in the pillow of fire and he
[1:07:25] said let there be light so Jesse was a
[1:07:28] great father Jesse was not the kind of
[1:07:31] father that was taking his his children
[1:07:33] to a boxing match Jesse was not the kind
[1:07:37] of father who was taking his sons to an
[1:07:40] NBA Stadium Jesse was the Holy Ghost
[1:07:48] father
[1:07:50] Hallelujah Jesse was a Bible father
[1:07:54] because a father is a priest and Jesse
[1:07:57] was a spoken word eag anointed Holy
[1:08:00] Ghost fi father amen amen how many
[1:08:04] fathers we need tonight like Jess who
[1:08:07] would set their boys and say boys let me
[1:08:09] tell you a story Hallelujah one day
[1:08:11] there was a man called Congressman
[1:08:13] upshore he was cre he was Creed for 68
[1:08:17] years and God spoke and he he walked
[1:08:20] again how many fathers do we have in
[1:08:22] these last days
[1:08:25] glory to God PR but but Jesse was a
[1:08:29] great man and David was the son of
[1:08:33] Jesse
[1:08:35] Hallelujah and now and the prophet talks
[1:08:37] in the message called leadership he says
[1:08:40] I can see amam coming back from work and
[1:08:44] probably his wife would massage his back
[1:08:48] from where he was working as a slave and
[1:08:50] then after dinner he would go climb up
[1:08:53] and he would begin to pray for
[1:08:54] Redemption AMR was in the order of Jess
[1:08:58] he was a great
[1:09:00] father Hallelujah he was not too tired
[1:09:04] to Worship the Lord amran was not the
[1:09:06] kind of man who say you know what I'm a
[1:09:08] slave who cares I've been working all
[1:09:10] day I worked 12 hours at McDonald's I'm
[1:09:14] not going to go to church amran was not
[1:09:16] the kind of
[1:09:21] man so David
[1:09:24] so Jonathan shot the arrow and he cried
[1:09:28] out and he says is not the arrow beyond
[1:09:31] the and David knew the the mystery that
[1:09:37] he was not going to be accepted back in
[1:09:39] the palace he had to run away and
[1:09:43] sometimes when God when you receive
[1:09:45] Christ he he sends you away whenever
[1:09:48] sometimes God you have an experience
[1:09:50] with the Holy Ghost you don't go back to
[1:09:52] the Palace to leave the soft life God
[1:09:55] sends you in the wilderness God sends
[1:09:57] you to
[1:09:59] [Applause]
[1:10:02] battle and David if he was not a strong
[1:10:05] man this could have discouraged
[1:10:08] him how can you be anointed king and
[1:10:12] then this one this man says the arrows
[1:10:14] are too far from sh and I want you to
[1:10:17] know that we are living in a time where
[1:10:20] people are getting
[1:10:22] discouraged
[1:10:24] suicide is at the highest in the history
[1:10:28] of our country in the history of the
[1:10:30] world because you know what people are
[1:10:33] giving
[1:10:34] up people are saying you know what these
[1:10:36] arrows are are just beyond me this is
[1:10:39] this is too much for me that's right
[1:10:42] what is the point Hallelujah people are
[1:10:46] just giving
[1:10:48] up and giving
[1:10:50] up suicide is the extreme case of it but
[1:10:55] many times when we give up we might not
[1:10:57] necessarily take our
[1:11:00] life you may be in your home but you
[1:11:03] have given up on your
[1:11:04] marriage you could be sitting on the Pew
[1:11:08] but your mind has given up already on
[1:11:10] the on the things of
[1:11:13] God hallelujah you could wake up in the
[1:11:16] morning take a shower go to work but you
[1:11:19] have already given up that's right and
[1:11:21] that's like 98% of
[1:11:24] when you lose the fighting
[1:11:28] [Applause]
[1:11:33] Spirit but I want to tell you tonight
[1:11:35] don't give up don't give up my brother
[1:11:38] don't give up my brother don't give up
[1:11:40] because you know what the arrows are not
[1:11:42] too far from Thee the kingdom is near
[1:11:45] unto thee even in th
[1:11:52] mouth others they're just coming to
[1:11:54] church but they've given up you know
[1:11:56] people used to worry about their
[1:11:59] dressing they used to worry about their
[1:12:01] conduct but now people have given up
[1:12:03] they don't care whatever comes wherever
[1:12:05] they invited people have given up the
[1:12:10] [Music]
[1:12:13] fight that's why the prophet preached a
[1:12:15] message called spiritual
[1:12:17] Amnesia is you forget who you are and
[1:12:20] you just and you just give up you come
[1:12:23] in ch Church during song surface you're
[1:12:25] not even singing you you have just given
[1:12:27] up you're just sitting like
[1:12:32] [Music]
[1:12:34] this have you ever seen homeless people
[1:12:37] sometimes they have given up on life
[1:12:40] they're just sitting on the bridge like
[1:12:43] this there's no ambition there's no
[1:12:46] reading the Bible there's no praying
[1:12:48] there's no fighting whatever happens I
[1:12:51] don't care I don't care I don't care
[1:12:55] and this was meant to discourage David
[1:12:59] to give up on the kingdom to say you
[1:13:02] know
[1:13:03] what why should I want to be a king this
[1:13:06] is too hard for
[1:13:07] me let me just live an ordinary
[1:13:12] life why should I worry about becoming
[1:13:16] bride let me let me just be like the
[1:13:20] Baptist let me just like just be like
[1:13:22] the rest of the
[1:13:25] Nations and you know what you give up on
[1:13:27] your
[1:13:28] possession and you give up on your
[1:13:30] inheritance but God does not want you to
[1:13:33] give up on your because you know what
[1:13:34] the Bible says the land shall never be
[1:13:37] sold
[1:13:39] forever if God gives you you can't even
[1:13:42] sell
[1:13:43] it even if you sold it it had to be
[1:13:49] redeemed because you cannot sell it
[1:13:52] forever
[1:13:55] so even if you give up God is not going
[1:13:57] to give up on
[1:13:59] you because the L cannot be sold forever
[1:14:03] it belongs to God you belong to God you
[1:14:06] belong to
[1:14:07] [Applause]
[1:14:11] God those are the laws of
[1:14:14] redemption the law the land cannot be
[1:14:16] sold forever because it is mine so God
[1:14:20] says you cannot be sought forever
[1:14:22] because you are
[1:14:27] mine Hallelujah you belong to
[1:14:30] Jesus that's why when you try to run
[1:14:33] away you found yourself coming back you
[1:14:36] Tred to go away you found yourself
[1:14:37] coming back because you belong to
[1:14:42] Jesus because Jesus will leave 99 and go
[1:14:46] after
[1:14:47] you says where is Kelly where is yed
[1:14:51] where is Edward where is stepen come
[1:14:54] back my son come
[1:14:59] back you used to pray three times a day
[1:15:02] and you stopped you know what God is
[1:15:04] calling you back come back to your
[1:15:06] position come back to your
[1:15:09] place you used to sing special songs and
[1:15:12] he stopped God is saying come back come
[1:15:15] back you cannot sell the land
[1:15:17] Forever This Is Your
[1:15:20] Land Jerusalem belongs to Judah there is
[1:15:24] no other person that can take your
[1:15:27] place the devil will tell you don't
[1:15:29] don't go to church don't worry brother
[1:15:31] robbers will be there your place is
[1:15:36] Irreplaceable the Millennium cannot
[1:15:38] start without
[1:15:43] you why are we here why are we here amen
[1:15:47] we are looking for the last seat amen we
[1:15:50] are looking for the last seat amen
[1:15:53] there is no one that can replace the
[1:15:55] last seed no sir God can say you know
[1:15:58] what I think this this is enough God is
[1:16:01] waiting for the last seat amen amen he
[1:16:03] could be in Somalia eating guavas under
[1:16:05] a tree we have to wait for him that's it
[1:16:10] that's it that's it that's it on the
[1:16:12] earth they'll say final boarding call
[1:16:14] God is no final boarding call if your
[1:16:17] name is z you got to be there amen amen
[1:16:21] amen amen yes
[1:16:24] Glory
[1:16:27] Hallelujah the prophet says my father
[1:16:29] was a rider yes and he went West
[1:16:32] breaking horses uhuh and he met my
[1:16:34] mother they were married right you know
[1:16:36] because that they met in the west and he
[1:16:38] was about 18 and one was 14 or 16 and
[1:16:42] the prophet talks about breaking horses
[1:16:44] yes my brother if it's a wild horse uhh
[1:16:47] you have to break it to domesticate it
[1:16:50] that's exactly right so to break the
[1:16:52] horse it's not not to physically break
[1:16:55] the horse no sir is to break the spirit
[1:16:59] of the
[1:17:00] horse
[1:17:02] amen so the enemy does not is not after
[1:17:06] your
[1:17:07] flesh he wants to break your
[1:17:12] spirit because the offenses and the
[1:17:15] discouragement in the Christian faith
[1:17:17] they are meant to to break your spirit
[1:17:21] because once go once once the devil
[1:17:23] breaks your spirit then you give up on
[1:17:25] your
[1:17:27] [Applause]
[1:17:30] testimony because remember will you
[1:17:32] overcome by the by by your
[1:17:34] testimony because Jesus Christ is the
[1:17:37] high priest of our
[1:17:40] confession the prophet says your
[1:17:42] salvation will last as long as your
[1:17:44] faith will last and your healing will
[1:17:46] last as long as your faith will last but
[1:17:49] the devil is after your
[1:17:52] testimony
[1:17:55] that's why he came to
[1:17:57] Jesus he says if thou be the Son of
[1:18:00] God says you know what if you can just
[1:18:03] change your testimony I'll give you all
[1:18:05] the kingdoms I'll give you Paris I'll
[1:18:07] give you London I'll give you New York
[1:18:10] Jesus Christ said I don't want it for
[1:18:12] free I'm going to pay for
[1:18:16] it and if you are a true born again eego
[1:18:20] you don't want things for free
[1:18:23] you count the cost and you say I'm going
[1:18:26] to pay for it I'm going to pay for it
[1:18:28] you count the
[1:18:30] cost Jesus Christ said if if if you're
[1:18:32] going to build a house you have to sit
[1:18:35] down and count the
[1:18:38] cost Netflix okay I can pay
[1:18:43] that makeup I can pay
[1:18:46] that shorts I can pay
[1:18:51] that
[1:18:53] I can pay
[1:18:54] that
[1:18:57] NFL the price is high but I'll pay
[1:18:59] [Applause]
[1:19:05] it a real believer sits down and count
[1:19:09] the cost that's why people go back
[1:19:12] because they don't count the
[1:19:16] cost Ruth could not go back Naomi tried
[1:19:21] to paint the picture for her says listen
[1:19:24] there's nothing for youo there but she
[1:19:26] says you know what I am going with you
[1:19:28] anyhow I'll take my choice with
[1:19:31] [Music]
[1:19:33] [Applause]
[1:19:35] you but the devil wants to break your
[1:19:37] spirit by discouraging you to say you
[1:19:41] know what the arrows are too far from
[1:19:43] you you can never be like brother
[1:19:46] brandham you can never be like brother
[1:19:48] sa and saw you are a weakling the arrows
[1:19:52] are Beyond you
[1:19:53] you that's what the devil does and
[1:19:56] people just give up you make one mistake
[1:19:59] say you not you're not part of the Bride
[1:20:01] you have crossed the
[1:20:02] line you never be a good preacher you
[1:20:06] never be a real believer you you have
[1:20:08] got many
[1:20:09] weaknesses that's the enemy right there
[1:20:13] because Christ does not save you on the
[1:20:15] basis of what you do he saves you
[1:20:18] because he loves you and he chose you
[1:20:21] and no matter what you do he will love
[1:20:23] you
[1:20:23] [Applause]
[1:20:27] anyhow but the devil is on a rampage
[1:20:30] discouraging people people are just
[1:20:33] sitting at home they're not going back
[1:20:35] to the barrooms they're not coming to
[1:20:37] church they just
[1:20:40] discouraged I don't like what what the
[1:20:42] pastor said to me that other day I don't
[1:20:44] like how my my case was
[1:20:47] handled and you just give
[1:20:51] up the prophet says so many have become
[1:20:55] offended so many people get offended so
[1:20:57] easy at the word of God it's contrary
[1:21:01] they want to lean to their own
[1:21:03] understanding they don't want to take
[1:21:05] the word of the
[1:21:08] lord it's like the days of Judges
[1:21:10] everyone had their own personal
[1:21:12] revelation because there was no Prophet
[1:21:16] when there was no Prophet the judge is
[1:21:17] rude you can do whatever you want this
[1:21:21] one does this this one does this but
[1:21:22] when the prophet comes there's a light
[1:21:26] and when the light comes we walk not in
[1:21:29] darkness but we walk in the light as he
[1:21:32] is the
[1:21:36] light second Timothy chapter chapter 2:3
[1:21:40] thou therefore inure hardness as a good
[1:21:44] soldier of Jesus Christ don't give
[1:21:49] up don't become
[1:21:51] weary inure
[1:21:54] hardness Hallelujah these days just
[1:21:58] somebody takes some a Brother's seat
[1:22:00] doesn't want to come to
[1:22:04] church I mean how can you be a good
[1:22:07] soldier I see you said for you to be a
[1:22:10] soldier you go through a Marine training
[1:22:13] or some other how many how many how many
[1:22:15] veterans do we have in this place God
[1:22:17] bless you veterans if you're a soldier
[1:22:20] you they have to they have to strengthen
[1:22:23] your
[1:22:24] spirit they take you from being a
[1:22:27] civilian to be a soldier they will put
[1:22:30] you different kind of situations so that
[1:22:34] you can have a strong
[1:22:37] Spirit they'll take you to Alaska
[1:22:40] they'll put you in the cold they'll put
[1:22:41] you in the sea all kinds of things
[1:22:44] depending on where you are stationed you
[1:22:47] could be an NC you could be a marine you
[1:22:49] could be this and the training depends
[1:22:52] depends on on where you are that's right
[1:22:55] and my training and your training may be
[1:22:57] different maybe I'm I'm in every maybe
[1:23:01] you are something else right so you have
[1:23:03] to accept your training because Christ
[1:23:06] knows that you have to graduate as a
[1:23:09] [Applause]

[1:27:37] they cometh they cometh the ruler of the
[1:27:40] synagogue's house saying unto him thy
[1:27:43] daughter is dead trouble not the
[1:27:47] master you see how the devil discourages
[1:27:50] people this man was a r ruler of the
[1:27:52] synagogue and he was a secret believer
[1:27:55] and God knows how to fish out the secret
[1:27:59] Believers he will send a
[1:28:01] sickness and this man being a ruler of
[1:28:04] the synagogue he had all the contacts in
[1:28:07] the city he had he knew the people that
[1:28:10] ran the best hospitals he knew all the
[1:28:13] best pediatrics but all those people
[1:28:16] could not help him and and and and and
[1:28:19] and and and one day he remembered you
[1:28:21] know what there's a man that we I've
[1:28:23] been somebody gave me his tapes I've
[1:28:25] been listening to his tapes I'm going to
[1:28:27] call upon him even if it's contrary to
[1:28:30] our church I'm going to call upon that
[1:28:35] man and he says you know what I'm going
[1:28:37] to go there I'm not going to send anyone
[1:28:39] I'm going to go myself because there's
[1:28:42] nothing painful for a parent than to
[1:28:45] hear your child coughing and you can't
[1:28:47] help them you try Tylenol you try this
[1:28:50] you try this nothing
[1:28:52] works you can't even go to sleep you
[1:28:55] hear them coughing in the night just
[1:28:58] losing weight wasting away you try
[1:29:01] everything that you you try everything
[1:29:04] God is working
[1:29:05] something and when gyrus said you know
[1:29:08] what I'm going to call the prophet of
[1:29:10] Nazareth let me call him so he went to
[1:29:13] the other cost and he found him and one
[1:29:16] thing I like about Jesus when you call
[1:29:18] him he's going to say yes God says yes
[1:29:22] God is not like a man if you go to a man
[1:29:25] and say can you help me you said to give
[1:29:27] you a
[1:29:29] lecture you know me I did this this I
[1:29:32] went through this remember what you did
[1:29:33] this to me God is not like that when you
[1:29:36] call upon God you will come so so gyrus
[1:29:40] went straight to Jesus never went he
[1:29:43] went straight to Jesus so when he found
[1:29:46] Jesus just like all of us when we find
[1:29:48] Jesus we say now everything is okay I
[1:29:51] found on Jesus my situation is going to
[1:29:55] be changed oh this man has worked many
[1:29:57] miracles but whilst he was walking with
[1:30:00] Jesus bad news come sometimes bad news
[1:30:04] comes when you are walking with Jesus
[1:30:07] that doesn't mean there's anything wrong
[1:30:08] with you bad news can come when you are
[1:30:12] walking with
[1:30:14] Jesus but when you are walking with
[1:30:16] Jesus when the bad news comes Jesus
[1:30:20] hears it
[1:30:22] Jesus hears the best news Jesus reads
[1:30:26] the email Jesus goes to the mailbox with
[1:30:29] you and he looks at a letter and he
[1:30:31] reads
[1:30:32] [Applause]
[1:30:35] it because he is there with
[1:30:38] you David says Thou Art with me David
[1:30:42] was convinced that Jesus Christ was with
[1:30:44] him all the
[1:30:45] [Music]
[1:30:46] [Applause]
[1:30:47] time and Jesus says and this person came
[1:30:52] says don't travel the master don't waste
[1:30:55] your time going to church don't waste
[1:30:57] your time reading the spoken
[1:31:00] word the daughter is dead this situation
[1:31:04] cannot be helped don't waste your time
[1:31:06] don't even call the pastor your marriage
[1:31:09] will never be
[1:31:10] remedied your children will never come
[1:31:13] to the Lord your daughter is dead that's
[1:31:17] what the devil want us to
[1:31:19] believe that your situation is
[1:31:23] remedy but when Jesus heard it
[1:31:26] Hallelujah when Jesus heard
[1:31:29] it Jesus hears he says my ears are not
[1:31:33] heavy that I cannot hear neither is my
[1:31:35] hand too short that I cannot save Jesus
[1:31:39] Christ he
[1:31:41] is he answered him saying fear not only
[1:31:46] believe that's why we sing the song only
[1:31:49] believe she shall be made
[1:31:52] Hall and they went and when they came
[1:31:55] into the house he suffered no man to go
[1:32:01] in sometimes you don't have to go with a
[1:32:03] lot of
[1:32:04] people the angel told the prophet you
[1:32:07] are walking with too many people for me
[1:32:09] to work with you God is not in
[1:32:13] numbers God is in
[1:32:17] individuals but we are living in a time
[1:32:19] of groups WhatsApp groups
[1:32:22] Tik Tok groups Instagram groups God is
[1:32:26] not interested in that's a
[1:32:28] denomination God works with individuals
[1:32:31] yes my
[1:32:33] brother
[1:32:35] clicks but when he went into the house
[1:32:38] he suffered that no man go in except
[1:32:42] faith hope and
[1:32:46] love it took brother Roberts brother
[1:32:48] kley and brother Seth
[1:32:52] amen and the father and the mother of
[1:32:53] the
[1:32:54] maiden and all wept am and bewailed her
[1:32:59] yes sir but he said weep not she is not
[1:33:02] dead but
[1:33:04] sleepeth
[1:33:06] Hallelujah but listen there were people
[1:33:09] that were there the Bible says they wept
[1:33:12] and they welled but if you read verse
[1:33:15] 53 it says they loved him to
[1:33:20] scorn when he says listen she's sleeping
[1:33:23] she's going to be well they went from
[1:33:26] weeping to
[1:33:30] [Applause]
[1:33:33] laughing they they were sending each
[1:33:35] other
[1:33:36] memes says can you believe
[1:33:39] this take your brother stage one
[1:33:46] weeping stage two laughing
[1:33:50] laughing
[1:33:53] [Applause]
[1:33:55] this shows that their condition they
[1:33:58] were backing because these were supposed
[1:34:00] to be Jews who knew the spoken word who
[1:34:04] knew that God sends prophets God can
[1:34:07] heal God can raise can raise the dead
[1:34:11] but the fact that they were laughing it
[1:34:13] shows that it shows how far they have
[1:34:15] been from the
[1:34:17] Lord
[1:34:19] hallelujah and he and verse verse verse
[1:34:22] 44 the Bible says and he put them all
[1:34:25] out yes sir Jesus Christ
[1:34:29] attitude towards
[1:34:31] unbelief has never
[1:34:34] changed he would put it all
[1:34:36] out and the prophet says how do you
[1:34:39] apply the token you take all the trash
[1:34:41] out all the television out all the
[1:34:44] minets out that's how you apply the toen
[1:34:47] it's a
[1:34:49] quat Jesus he put them all out and he
[1:34:53] took her by the hand and called and said
[1:34:55] maid arise am and the Spirit came again
[1:35:00] and she Rose straight away let me give
[1:35:02] you a testimony there was a brother who
[1:35:05] had a who had a daughter who has a
[1:35:06] daughter she's about maybe 10 so the she
[1:35:09] was she was playing you know how kids

[1:35:18] playing so she begged she was begging
[1:35:21] she she was baking out she had a very
[1:35:23] large SUV I think it's the Nissan
[1:35:27] Amada and as she was baking out she she
[1:35:29] had a scream she ran on top of of the
[1:35:34] girl and it was so bad so they

[1:35:42] and the helicopter lifted up this this
[1:35:45] lady from her place straight to LaVine
[1:35:47] children's home because they had to act
[1:35:50] quickly
[1:35:52] so because we we live close by you know

[1:36:43] the Lord yes sir brother Bram told a
[1:36:46] woman that your situation changed
[1:36:49] because that mother when she prayed for
[1:36:50] your baby exactly right we are not
[1:36:53] Catholics we believe all the power is in
[1:36:55] a in a bishop or in a pastor sometimes
[1:36:58] you don't even need to call the pastor
[1:36:59] at
[1:37:00] midnight pray with your husband and send
[1:37:04] the testimony and say pastor we prayed
[1:37:07] and the demon

[1:37:15] need to call the Deacon there are
[1:37:17] situations where you need to do that to
[1:37:19] call the Elders sometimes just find
[1:37:21] brother close by Brother there's a
[1:37:22] situation come let's pray the prophet
[1:37:25] says a church that is well taught knows
[1:37:27] how to do that the prophet says when I
[1:37:30] was away the elders prayed for a dead
[1:37:32] person and he came back to
[1:37:34] [Applause]
[1:37:36] life in choosing of a
[1:37:39] bride so so we prayed and they did I
[1:37:43] don't know whether it was
[1:37:45] 40 multiple scans I forgot dozens of
[1:37:48] dozens of scans they said this is
[1:37:51] unbelievable that's it there is nothing
[1:37:54] that's it we are discharging you she
[1:37:57] went back home she had
[1:38:01] nothing
[1:38:03] Hallelujah Jesus Christ breaks the F
[1:38:07] Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today
[1:38:10] and
[1:38:13] forever Hallelujah are the arrows Beyond
[1:38:16] you tonight the Kingdom of Heaven is
[1:38:19] closed to you
[1:38:21] am
[1:38:23] amen but you know what the devil wanted
[1:38:27] to discourage Jas trouble not the
[1:38:31] master now let's I want to read the
[1:38:34] scripture
[1:38:35] here Job chapter 2 verse 9 job yes sir
[1:38:39] the B says then his wife said to him do
[1:38:42] you still cling to your God says ciss
[1:38:46] God and die in other words why do you
[1:38:49] trouble yourself just give up and
[1:38:52] whenever you hear that kind of speech
[1:38:54] just know that it's not from
[1:38:56] God it's of the devil because you know
[1:39:00] what God does not go back remember in
[1:39:02] the Book of Ezekiel when the living
[1:39:04] creatures Ezekiel Saw them yes sir he
[1:39:07] says they had eyes all over and they had
[1:39:09] four faces it says they turned not where
[1:39:13] they went says if they were going this
[1:39:16] way they were going forward if they were
[1:39:18] going this way they were going forward
[1:39:20] if they were going this way they were
[1:39:21] moving forward they turned not when they
[1:39:25] went which means that if you are a son
[1:39:27] of God everything works together for
[1:39:29] good you are never going back whatever
[1:39:33] happens you are moving
[1:39:35] forward no
[1:39:38] [Applause]
[1:39:39] reverse and he says Cur God and
[1:39:42] die and job job says you speak like a
[1:39:45] foolish
[1:39:47] woman you want she wanted she wanted to
[1:39:49] discourage Jo
[1:39:52] that's what it is it's all about
[1:39:55] discouragement oh that long skirt you
[1:39:57] look like an old
[1:39:59] lady take your
[1:40:01] time I saw I was reading a new news
[1:40:05] article where they were trying to bring
[1:40:07] legislation against Big T says because
[1:40:10] many girls are being affected and a lot
[1:40:14] of them are are committing suicide
[1:40:17] because they look at people at Instagram
[1:40:18] they said how can I be like this I'm I'm
[1:40:21] I'm how can I ever come to be like this
[1:40:24] you know what that's the devil using
[1:40:27] those
[1:40:28] influencers who is influencing the
[1:40:33] influencers you see the prophet preached
[1:40:36] a message called
[1:40:37] influences six times or even more says
[1:40:42] you you can influence you have to be
[1:40:45] careful because there is no one who can
[1:40:47] just become an influencer for for for no
[1:40:49] reason the influencer will be sponsored
[1:40:52] by someone and the person who sponsors
[1:40:55] the
[1:40:56] influencer many times they are not
[1:40:59] really message Believers or
[1:41:05] Christians so the the juty of the
[1:41:07] influencer is to influence people yes
[1:41:09] sir and these people they are doing it
[1:41:11] to make money but you know what the
[1:41:14] devil is not interested in money really
[1:41:17] the devil is interested in SS of men
[1:41:23] because the Bible says whatever is
[1:41:26] highly esteemed in the world it's an
[1:41:28] Abomination unto the Lord that's a
[1:41:33] scripture I've seen people saying okay
[1:41:35] there's this group in on Facebook we
[1:41:38] have question and answers they say is he
[1:41:40] a deacon who ordained him where do you
[1:41:44] know his
[1:41:45] life which which
[1:41:48] scripture you you said this is that's
[1:41:51] the problem of the
[1:41:53] day people become attached to the
[1:41:56] virtual world to somebody that you have
[1:41:58] never met someone who who is who they
[1:42:01] create a WhatsApp group and they live
[1:42:03] somewhere I don't know in they live I
[1:42:06] don't know there are somewhere in chuya
[1:42:08] there in
[1:42:10] Zimbabwe you don't even know their life
[1:42:13] all they have is a smartphone some of
[1:42:16] them don't even go to church they were
[1:42:17] chased away from their
[1:42:19] churches but you know what they
[1:42:23] [Applause]
[1:42:24] influencers you see you have to come
[1:42:27] from the
[1:42:29] Bible even for me to come here brother
[1:42:32] stepen has to know my life I I I have a
[1:42:35] church that I go to I don't just come
[1:42:37] out of nowhere and start preaching no
[1:42:40] you have to go by the
[1:42:45] word I see
[1:42:47] people can I add to this group for what
[1:42:51] if I have a question I'll ask my pastor
[1:42:53] the Bible says women if you have a
[1:42:55] question ask your
[1:42:57] husband if the husband doesn't know he
[1:42:59] can ask the pastor Hallelujah but you
[1:43:03] know what people people want to ask
[1:43:05] virtual
[1:43:07] world because you see science moves with
[1:43:11] civilization now they have what what is
[1:43:13] called Vision
[1:43:14] Pro it's like you are in reality but you
[1:43:17] are interacting with another
[1:43:19] dimension because God says I will pour
[1:43:22] out my spirit in the last days and your
[1:43:25] young men shall see Visions because the
[1:43:27] anointing that was given and the word in
[1:43:30] this hour will be so high until one of
[1:43:34] these days we shall see the body of
[1:43:36] brother Bram just before the Rapture for
[1:43:39] a few days we shall see we shall see the
[1:43:41] Saints we shall interact with the with
[1:43:44] the next
[1:43:46] Dimension because of the anointing and
[1:43:48] the word that was given to us
[1:43:51] we are supposed to be interacting with
[1:43:53] our
[1:43:54] theophanies with Angelic
[1:43:57] beings but the enemy has gone
[1:44:00] behind and he's causing people to
[1:44:03] interact with another
[1:44:05] dimension through
[1:44:08] science Hallelujah but let me tell you
[1:44:11] something young man interact with the
[1:44:14] angels interact with with with angels
[1:44:17] with Dimensions with the Holy Ghost yes
[1:44:22] [Applause]
[1:44:25] because science and civilization travel
[1:44:28] together someone could be sitting there
[1:44:31] they are watching something on the
[1:44:32] Vision Pro but you know what after
[1:44:35] praying in the morning you could be
[1:44:37] sitting in the office but you could be
[1:44:39] in a different
[1:44:41] dimension Hallelujah Angels descending
[1:44:44] and ascending upon the sons of
[1:44:48] God GL GL GL
[1:44:50] [Applause]
[1:44:51] [Music]
[1:44:54] Hallelujah my time is running
[1:44:57] out oh
[1:45:00] my John 3: 26 let's open this one I like
[1:45:04] the sound of Bibles being turns nothing
[1:45:08] is sweeter than the the the Turning of
[1:45:11] of The Bible
[1:45:16] Pages don't feel bad if you have a
[1:45:18] digital Bible
[1:45:23] [Applause]
[1:45:27] the Bible says the letter
[1:45:28] kth so I like the
[1:45:33] letter all right
[1:45:35] 3:26 the Bible says and they came unto
[1:45:39] John who is
[1:45:42] they they came unto John and said unto
[1:45:45] him
[1:45:47] Rabbi he that was with you beyond Jordan
[1:45:50] done he that was in your church the one
[1:45:54] that left your church to whom you
[1:45:56] baptized you led to Christ behold behold
[1:46:00] the same baptizeth and all men come to
[1:46:04] him
[1:46:06] amen I forgot to finish this the third
[1:46:09] stage was they were
[1:46:13] astonished if you go back to the
[1:46:15] scripture those were St but anyway going
[1:46:18] back to this scripture
[1:46:21] these people went to John and they said
[1:46:23] the man that you baptized he's gaining
[1:46:26] more followers than you what do you
[1:46:29] think this was meant to do unto John
[1:46:31] because when John baptized Jesus all the
[1:46:33] people left and they followed Christ but
[1:46:35] you know what a true servant of God
[1:46:37] always leads people to Christ and it
[1:46:41] does it does not offend you where people
[1:46:43] as long as they are going to Christ I'm
[1:46:46] okay with that we are happy with
[1:46:49] that remember the the Servants of lot
[1:46:52] and the Servants of Abraham they were
[1:46:54] fighting over over over over the Sheep
[1:46:57] but you know what none of that was
[1:46:59] theirs it belonged to Abraham and it
[1:47:02] belonged to lot you see ministers
[1:47:06] [Applause]
[1:47:07] fighting but these are not your sheep
[1:47:10] this sheep belong to
[1:47:13] God you are just a Shepherd these are
[1:47:17] not your
[1:47:19] sheep
[1:47:21] [Applause]
[1:47:23] if you ever going to a restaurant and
[1:47:25] then and then they say can you give me
[1:47:28] give me your keys and then they take
[1:47:30] your nice car they go and PK it the guy
[1:47:33] if he forgets that this is not his car
[1:47:35] he may become very
[1:47:37] comfortable but that is not your car you
[1:47:40] just parking that car so the flock is
[1:47:43] not ours but it belongs to
[1:47:49] God this is why I love brother Steven
[1:47:52] because he has got different Ministries
[1:47:54] coming here because he know that this is
[1:47:56] not about him it's about Christ he is
[1:48:00] leading people to Christ he's not
[1:48:02] binding people to himself say only
[1:48:05] listen to
[1:48:06] me I'm the only anointed one no sir it's
[1:48:10] about Jesus
[1:48:12] Christ so these came to John and they
[1:48:16] said and he
[1:48:18] said oh men come to him now if if John
[1:48:24] wasn't an eagle you could have gone in
[1:48:27] the flesh said oh okay can I tell you
[1:48:30] something about that man actually he's
[1:48:32] not a real Christian that man did this
[1:48:34] this this and this this this oh you know
[1:48:36] I'm the greatest born among women but
[1:48:38] John never say that he
[1:48:42] refused to be discouraged he refused to
[1:48:45] go in the flesh am and I want you to
[1:48:49] watch carefully the word word as I'm
[1:48:50] closing hallu says all men come to him
[1:48:54] now the devil likes to abuse the word oh
[1:48:59] men oh
[1:49:02] man oh
[1:49:05] everyone oh everyone is doing
[1:49:09] this this is supposed to make you feel
[1:49:11] like maybe maybe I'm
[1:49:15] crazy because you know what everyone is
[1:49:19] is going to watch this
[1:49:21] yeah every if everyone is putting
[1:49:25] makeup and the devil tell what's so
[1:49:27] special about
[1:49:29] you everyone is doing this everyone is
[1:49:32] following
[1:49:34] John I you have to watch those
[1:49:38] words the devil likes to to present
[1:49:40] something as if hey you're the only one
[1:49:43] out but if you are a true ego even if
[1:49:45] you're the only one you will still stand
[1:49:48] by your convictions
[1:49:52] but John said John answered and said a
[1:49:55] man can receive nothing except it be
[1:49:58] given him from Heaven hallelujah
[1:50:02] hallelujah I like that yes sir now Paul
[1:50:05] says
[1:50:06] here I'm going to read this scripture
[1:50:08] because my time is finished I fought a
[1:50:10] good fight yes sir I finished my I
[1:50:12] finished my course amen I have kept the
[1:50:16] faith Amen in other
[1:50:19] words he fought a good fight yes he
[1:50:21] finished the course and he he he kept
[1:50:24] the faith now in the book of Timothy
[1:50:27] where he Paul was writing he uses a word
[1:50:29] there was one time where he says You
[1:50:31] must keep let's open it 1 Timothy
[1:50:34] chapter 18 verse uh chapter 1 verse
[1:50:37] 18 it says some have Shipwrecked their
[1:50:41] faith because remember the devil wants
[1:50:44] to shipwreck your faith now of course to
[1:50:47] a to a real believer that that doesn't
[1:50:49] apply really
[1:50:51] but remember they are borderline
[1:50:53] Believers out there they are make
[1:50:55] Believers we just you know preach to a
[1:50:56] mixed multitude so we have to apply all
[1:50:59] the
[1:51:00] scriptures says this I charge the commit
[1:51:03] unto this son Timothy according to the
[1:51:06] prophecies uh which went before thee
[1:51:09] that thou must War a good Warfare
[1:51:12] holding faith and a good conscience
[1:51:15] which some having put away concerning
[1:51:17] Faith have made
[1:51:20] shipwreck right it says of whom is a hus
[1:51:24] in Alexandra whom I have delivered unto
[1:51:26] Satan that they learn not to blaspheme
[1:51:29] another scripture he says like he's
[1:51:31] blaspheming is saying the resurrection
[1:51:33] is passed so a wrong Doctrine can be
[1:51:37] Blasphemous
[1:51:39] that'sa a wrong Doctrine can be
[1:51:41] Blasphemous that's exactly right that's
[1:51:44] why when people started to say to the
[1:51:45] prophet you are the Christ he says I
[1:51:47] would rather die as a man than to die is
[1:51:50] an antichrist because that was a
[1:51:53] Blasphemous
[1:51:56] Doctrine that's why we believe that the
[1:51:58] ministry must continue we play the tapes
[1:52:01] but God also has raised people that can
[1:52:04] preach the
[1:52:05] gospel because you cannot put everything
[1:52:08] in one man even Jesus Christ he said
[1:52:11] unless the corn of wheat Force to the
[1:52:14] ground and multiply it abide it alone
[1:52:18] even Jesus did not want to do it alone
[1:52:20] by himself he says I must be glorified
[1:52:24] so that I can come back to
[1:52:27] [Music]
[1:52:29] you because
[1:52:31] remember Hallelujah the
[1:52:35] Vindication of a of a son of man is the
[1:52:38] book of Acts because remember what what
[1:52:41] followed What followed Moses take your
[1:52:44] time what followed
[1:52:46] Moses it was Joshua right what is Joshua
[1:52:51] holy spirit it's the Ephesians it's the
[1:52:53] Holy Ghost right this is the Ephesians
[1:52:56] right what what is Ephesians is the
[1:52:59] dividing of the land now why would you
[1:53:01] need the land if you're just going to be
[1:53:02] sitting in the church just playing TS
[1:53:05] and doing nothing you have to be placed
[1:53:08] in your position in Ephesians so the son
[1:53:11] of man Ministry is followed by the by
[1:53:15] the Son of God Ministry is the Holy
[1:53:17] Ghost so so when you have
[1:53:21] Jesus then you have the book of what the
[1:53:23] book of the book of Acts
[1:53:26] right right that's why the book of Acts
[1:53:29] is actually a continuation of the Book
[1:53:31] of
[1:53:32] Luke if you read let's open
[1:53:38] it the book of Acts is a continuation of
[1:53:41] the Book of Luke you can't say I only
[1:53:44] want Luke I don't want acts then you are
[1:53:46] denying the Bible friends you cannot
[1:53:50] make brother Bram contradict the Bible
[1:53:53] brother Bram was a scriptural
[1:53:57] prophet and brother brother Steven's
[1:53:59] most popular statement is the B this
[1:54:02] message is perfectly in line with the
[1:54:07] Bible Acts chapter one the former
[1:54:10] treaties have I began on have I made all
[1:54:14] all theop of all that Jesus began both
[1:54:17] to do and teach until the day which he
[1:54:20] was taken after right so so so the book
[1:54:23] the former treaties is the Book of Luke
[1:54:26] which is the ministry of the son of man
[1:54:28] which is this one but this is the letter
[1:54:31] treaty right the former treaty the book
[1:54:33] of Acts and the Book of Luke this is
[1:54:35] Moses in the wilderness and then this is
[1:54:37] Joshua which is your Ephesians and you
[1:54:40] cannot separate one from the other you
[1:54:43] cannot separate the prophet and the
[1:54:47] Bride Can We Stand upon our feet
[1:54:54] are you discouraged
[1:54:56] tonight God drops handfuls on purpose
[1:55:00] brother because he does not want Ruth to
[1:55:02] be
[1:55:03] discouraged that's why God sent a
[1:55:05] Revival that's why there's a brother who
[1:55:08] says brother can you come and have this
[1:55:10] because many shall be offended the Bible
[1:55:12] says that because the night was long The
[1:55:15] Virgins they became drowsy and they
[1:55:18] became weary and they began to sleep
[1:55:21] until a a a voice went out says arise
[1:55:24] and trim your lamps that was the voice
[1:55:27] of the Resurrection the message of the
[1:55:29] hour but they were becoming drowsy they
[1:55:32] were becoming discouraged see people
[1:55:35] becoming discouraged going to church is
[1:55:37] no longer
[1:55:38] fashionable even coming to church people
[1:55:41] are just thinking about something else
[1:55:44] Hallelujah but God he's still upon the
[1:55:47] throne am and he knows what he's doing
[1:55:51] when the enemy tells you the arrow is
[1:55:53] far from thee say no the kingdom is of
[1:55:55] God is closed by Brother
[1:55:58] Branham when the field was
[1:56:01] flooded and many people you can play
[1:56:04] something softly and many people were
[1:56:06] going out to preach the invitation
[1:56:08] started to become low because know the F
[1:56:11] everyone was doing impersonating him and
[1:56:14] people were writing letters to him to
[1:56:16] discourage him they said you are washed
[1:56:19] up change your ministry and then you
[1:56:22] start to have many people coming to you
[1:56:24] and he was writing back to them he said
[1:56:26] I'm no I'm not washed up I know exactly
[1:56:28] where I'm standing and he and he
[1:56:30] preached the message the present stage
[1:56:32] of my Ministry and that was around June
[1:56:35] maybe July and says when my Ministry is
[1:56:38] here I know that it's ready to be
[1:56:40] crowned and a few months after that
[1:56:43] that's when the angel came and they
[1:56:45] opened the seals to sh but before that
[1:56:48] he was getting
[1:56:50] discouragements and discouragements
[1:56:52] always come right before the victory
[1:56:56] Hallelujah don't be discouraged the
[1:56:58] devil tell you look there's no boys
[1:57:00] there are no boys in church what is the
[1:57:03] point try something
[1:57:05] else try try try to use an app download
[1:57:10] this app try to find people try when
[1:57:12] never try to do something Hallelujah
[1:57:14] when Abraham tried to do something he
[1:57:17] came with ishma that's exactly is is a
[1:57:20] wild
[1:57:21] man it's a testimony but it's a wild
[1:57:26] testimony but you stay right with the
[1:57:29] word and you wait upon the promise am
[1:57:31] don't say oh there are no girls in my
[1:57:33] church what can I do maybe I should try

[1:57:55] an age where everything has to be

[1:58:22] disciples they were at Sea and and it
[1:58:25] looked like they were going to sink and
[1:58:28] they said Master can not that we perish
[1:58:30] and you Rose up and you said peace be
[1:58:33] still you were there in the boat Lord

[2:00:47] amen some body encourage
[2:00:50] tonight amen glory to God what I love
[2:00:54] about him is he knows how to surrender
[2:00:57] to the spirit and let the Holy Spirit
[2:01:00] work to every Avenue and touch his
[2:01:03] children where he wanted to teach I know
[2:01:07] someone was touched tonight somebody was
[2:01:10] strengthened tonight somebody who was
[2:01:12] down the Holy Spirit strengthen you
[2:01:14] somebody who's not here who's streaming
[2:01:17] the Holy Spirit warn you
[2:01:19] be patient everything is all right and
[2:01:23] sometime the answers of God comes when
[2:01:26] everything is almost going down that's
[2:01:29] when the greatest testimony is coming
[2:01:32] you know when you follow somebody and
[2:01:37] will you stay around maybe someone a
[2:01:39] long time do not be somebody who's taken
[2:01:42] up by
[2:01:44] distractions God put you with someone
[2:01:46] for a
[2:01:48] purpose and if you lose that experience
[2:01:51] you might be losing your
[2:01:53] training so meaning whenever you come to
[2:01:56] this church whatever the Lord has been
[2:01:58] doing here the Lord has been training
[2:02:01] you because there is a task that is
[2:02:04] ahead so if the way you see the word
[2:02:09] operating that's the way you should be
[2:02:11] operating you cannot be here for 3 years
[2:02:14] and you're still acting the same way you
[2:02:16] were before we even start this church it
[2:02:18] mean you are not progressing it means
[2:02:21] something is wrong so that has been said
[2:02:24] before you jump into
[2:02:26] anything young adult young people begin
[2:02:30] to examine things the way we
[2:02:33] examine how did your pastor train you he
[2:02:36] train you in the Bible and the message
[2:02:39] of the hour whatever the pastor is
[2:02:41] trying to do in the church he always try
[2:02:43] to back it up by the Bible by the
[2:02:46] message of the hour it's a training that
[2:02:48] I'm giving to all of you so that
[2:02:51] whenever you want to do something in
[2:02:52] your life always look and sit down and
[2:02:56] say what has the word say is there any
[2:02:58] Scripture here can I call a brother can
[2:03:01] I call an older sister and say do you
[2:03:03] know if brother Bram ever say something
[2:03:05] about this or can I call the pastor and
[2:03:07] say brother Stephen I'm trying to do
[2:03:09] this what does the word says about this
[2:03:11] because when you know what the will of
[2:03:14] God is it give you confidence then you
[2:03:17] know that what you're doing is fine and
[2:03:20] if the devil ever rise up against you
[2:03:23] you can stand and fight him because
[2:03:25] you're not venturing into an Uncharted
[2:03:27] Territory but you know exactly what
[2:03:29] you're doing so even those groups that
[2:03:32] they say young people groups before you
[2:03:35] join a group stop and ask a question and
[2:03:39] most of the time when you Chace those
[2:03:41] group you will find out that it's
[2:03:43] handled by an individual and there is no
[2:03:46] supervision of a pastor no supervision a
[2:03:49] deacon it was just young people that got
[2:03:51] around and put a group there and you are
[2:03:54] doomed for a disaster if you are in
[2:03:56] something like that you need to come out
[2:03:59] because you are discussing things you
[2:04:00] don't know and you can swallow things
[2:04:02] you don't understand one time I was
[2:04:05] chasing something really popular in the
[2:04:08] message and I was tracing it and I trace
[2:04:10] it and I say who's responsible for and I
[2:04:12] thought he was a minister he was this
[2:04:14] Minister it was this Min at the end of
[2:04:16] the day there was no Pastor supervising
[2:04:18] this
[2:04:19] and I stop I say so who's assigning the
[2:04:21] people they say it is brother so and so
[2:04:25] and I took his number and I begin to
[2:04:27] trace him on social media and I begin to
[2:04:30] study him when he post something I take
[2:04:32] a screenshot and if I show you what I
[2:04:35] see from that brother I wonder how with
[2:04:38] the level of spirituality he has he can
[2:04:41] handle young people all over the country
[2:04:44] in the message because he himself is
[2:04:46] struggling with a lot of stuff based on
[2:04:48] what I have been saying so you have
[2:04:52] been directed or you have been led by
