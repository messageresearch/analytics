after we ate lunch as soon as I finish eating the nauseousness started again and my husband told me when it comes just rebuke it and let it stay it's not coming out so I was trying to do that but then I really wanted to throw up so I set up my machine to have treatment and whilst I was doing all that I was feeling nauseous so I sat down after the machine has primed and everything I was sitting down quietly and then it came so I stood up and whilst I was going to the bathroom I started throwing up on the on my way to the bathroom so whilst I I was doing that I got choked I couldn't breathe I was gasping for air and Seth wasn't around and I could not breathe and I thought that was it I thought I was dying but I was able to get to the sink so I threw up all on me and I got to the sink and I rinsed my face for like 50 to one minute I couldn't breathe and it was God I wouldn't be alive here today so I want to sing this song and appreciate the love God has for me amen yes [Music] yes in two

prophet voice and I can't remember which sermon it was but you start to sing this song as he's calling people to come and receive the Holy Ghost and I'd just like to sing that tonight but it just reminds me that when Peter when Peter came back from Allah to prison and when they came in all the people rejoiced together and the Bible said then they lifted up their voice in one Accord and my mind says how will they all be saying the same thing at the same time so as I sing this song I want us all to be an accord and sing it with me I think you all must know it and spirit of the Living God full

give the Lord the clap off Hallelujah you know as a musician we should always have a song to sing do you know that you don't know [Laughter] in the old church if you recall when we spoke about the power of praises do you remember singing is preaching do you know that if you need a coach you see me amen the key behind that is a musician should consecrate themselves like a preacher in other words you keep yourself under the atmosphere all the time and when you come to the house of God you are ready anytime to sing for the Lord so we should not even beg anybody for special here you should have

from the book of Genesis just to encourage ourselves I love to encourage the people of God to keep pressing on Lester from Genesis chapter 17. Genesis chapter 17. let's just read from verse 15. Genesis 17 from verse 15. yes my brother and God said unto Abraham as for Sarai thy wife that shall not call a name Sarai but Sarah [Music] may be and I'll bless thee and I'll blessed her and give thee a son also of air yay I will bless her and she shall be a mother of Nations Kings of people shall be of Heaven then Abraham fell upon his face and laugh take notes and Abraham fell on his face and laughed and said in his heart a child be born unto him that is 100 years old Sarah that is 90 years old bear and Abraham said unto God oh that Ishmael might live before thee and God said Sarah thy wife shall bear thee a son indeed and thou shall call his name Isaac amen and I will establish my Covenant with him for an Everlasting Covenant and with his seed after him amen amen shall we be seated as I read from the gospel of Saint Luke chapter 1. it's a familiar scripture there look chapter one let's just read Luke chapter one a few lines um they say Mary unto the angel how shall this be seeing I know not a man and the angel answered and said unto her the Holy Ghost shall come upon thee and the power of the highest Shah overshadow thee therefore also that only thing which shall be born of thee shall be called the son of God and behold thy curse in Elizabeth she have also conceived a son in a old age and this is the sixth month who was called Barry for with God nothing shall be impossible amen amen for with God nothing shall be impossible whatever your condition remember that for with God nothing shall be impossible so we start from the book of Genesis and we this is we've read about uh Our Father Abraham the father of faith Hallelujah it was Abraham and at a point in time God came down and said your name shall no more be called Abraham but Abraham shall be your name amen Abraham and we have been taught that that means father of Nations and this is a man that was he like he was saying that a child be born to somebody that is hundred years so God told him again I said and also not you alone because you and your wife are one so your name has been changed and your wife name must be changed so the blessing that came to Abraham fall upon Sarah too so God said you will not call a name Sarai but Sarah shall be a name praise the Lord Hallelujah and then the story goes on and he said and I will bless her and are we blessing amen God is speaking and our and give thee as soon also of air I will bless her and I'll give you a son also of her what is he saying and she shall be a mother of Nations of people shall be of air a mother of Nations and things of people shall be afraid [Music] and Abraham fell on his face and laugh s April fell on his face and laughed and he didn't just stopped there and he said hit his heart a child be born unto him that is 100 years old and sassara that is 90 years old bear Abraham life Abraham laugh Hallelujah any question is this possible that's right a man of hundred years and Sarah that is 90 years old to bear and he said it should be a matter of Nations and places so I come out of it brothers and sisters with God nothing shall be impossible [Music] Hallelujah Hallelujah he said Sarah and not me I am 100 years old a man that is 100 years old if it was common he would not have questioned if it was common it would not have questioned it but it was not common then but God Can Make The Uncommon to become common God can make the impossibility to be made possible praise the Lord are we together I just love it I will bless you hand and give thee a song also of her yea I will bless her and she shall be a mother of Nations at 19 years old [Music] problem so what's your fear so what are you crying for so what are you worrying for so what's your fear I will make a mother of Nations at the age of 90. for we've got nothing shall be shall be just yet to encourage you to know that with God nothing Abrams fell upon his face and love right he laughs that's exactly right any question in his heart oh my God what is

his mind about you it's a mind about the bride about the church before the foundation of the world he proposed to have a bride a chest bride with that spot with that wrinkle without any blemish to

your cry I've seen the affliction I have come down to bring them out because that was his promise it was settled for the foundation of the word amen Pharaoh said who is the Lord that I should let Israel go who is the Lord that's what Pharaoh said Israel is going nowhere and God said indeed Israel is going out Israel Shah indeed go out [Applause] no feral can't hold them no power can keep them nothing can break my word because it is God's promise it is God's word that they give to Abraham thy seed will be in a straight line for 400 years and after Israel indeed whether Pharaoh like it or not whether recipe or whatever God is a purpose it plan it decided and he himself work on it executed it and he got the characters involved to do it Hallelujah glory to God don't you love him don't

and everything blessed be the name of the Lord Hallelujah you know that I'm saying I just want to encourage you don't be discouraged keep trusting the Lord don't reason with God's word and don't reason with it because this Moorhead cannot comprehend this thing [Applause] why should God choose Moses that is God's choice once you go to his brother Brian that is God's choice it might not be to you but that's God's choice why should God you saw that is his choice [Music] why should God choose David that is his choice and he said this is a man after my own heart a man that even committed adultery and he killed and God said that's a man after my own heart who are you to question God why do you say that this is a man after your heart he said that is a man after my own heart he might not be a man after your heart it might not be a woman after your heart oh yes sir but this is a bride he said that's a bride after his heart when you look at the bride today to the denominations to the people of the word he know there cannot be but that is God's choice mean to seize their own wives you choose your wife your wife might not be the wife after my heart your husband might not be after somebody's but God said and you make a choice the woman of my heart the man of my heart and God choose a bride he said that's the woman of my heart God choose a man God is a prophet God choose his people he said these are the people of my heart [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] indeed shall be a son this bride was not chosen two years ago five years ago 10 years ago 50 years ago thousand years ago it was chosen before the foundation of the word that the system was taken before the foundation of the work yeah yeah Hallelujah God bless you Church Hallelujah amen medicine how can these things be I can't listen to me so I said I indeed Bear Song I can distance me we've got nothing shall be impossible the angel told him everybody knew that to be about a woman the angel said it too the angel reminded Mary that even your case that is record a story a story a barring woman embody woman and pastor's wife and she said Baron and she is this and that and that and that and that and that and that even Zacharias when the angel met him the angel told him that his wife will give birth conceive himself oh I'm an old man my wife is old so what so what your wife is so so what [Music] happened and the system has already been taken May the grace of God override it [Music] because God has already taken that decision because that vision is for an appointed time not you he has a program why they didn't have a child when they got married while they were going through difficulties he has a plan he has a plan for you he has a purpose for you he has a program for your life Hallelujah the angel said oh your prayer has been heard it has become a memorial oh your wife is good instead of going to say praise the Lord it became sad he began to think what would people be thinking what people be thinking Abraham was saying that a man that is hundred years to burn Sarah that is 90 years what would people be thinking and many at times our problem is what people will be thinking exactly right right so we want our own ways to be blessed oh that Ishmael will live or why don't you do it this way rather why don't you go this way rather God has a plan not your Ishmael yes I will not take much of your time but let me tell you something the man that said can a man that is 100 years old born everyone said that do you know that after 100 years he was still giving birth huh Genesis 25 not the death of Sarah and they have about seven or five children six children the man that was questioning that 100 years old man to burn after 100 years God can do a siblingly abundantly than what you can even think about abundantly God is so great God is so mighty God is so wonderful Hallelujah a siblingly abundantly thank you somebody give a Clapper friend to our Lord [Applause] [Music] Hallelujah was he not the man that said a man that is 100 years old born at this hour it was cross hundred April was over 100 years about 120 or 140 years for with God for with God for with God for with God nothing [Applause] God bless you [Applause] [Music] let's give the Lord a big clap offering [Applause] Hallelujah amen praise God that's a shooting of a veteran amen precise and that's it that's why I like veteran my god with God nothing shall be impossible glory to God oh my God oh my God my God he even gave me a really strong bullet for Sunday I will tell you that only on Sunday so don't play with my heife amen it's a powerful weapon amen a very strong bullet that came into a head of scripture at home for Sunday and then he loaded me with a second one it's unbelievable my god let's go to Genesis 17. my my amen in other words your life have been programmed before the foundation of the world amen who would have taught this church was in the mind of God you see what I'm saying who would have thought if everything we were doing God has his own plan and when time comes he rocked you on the boat you cried you went and now you're happy you forgot the crying you were crying oh my God I'm so disappointed today you like pitch pitch do you remember God just back a few years ago and remember the cry and the disappointment you didn't even want to go to church now you the one even if it rain like today ah and they telephone goes bbp alarm and you still turn it off and you're in church you see you see go to Genesis 17 unbelievable praise God thank you brother timashon amen verse 15. you there and God say unto who you know that right as for sarri if you look at that it's s a r a i shall not call her name Sarah but Sarah shall her name be water so the first time God is speaking to Abraham to change the name is Rana anybody care so God changed the name God already changed the name of Sarah in his mind now he spoke it everybody care watch the next verse you there and I will bless her and give this son also of her ye I will bless her and she shall be a mother of Nations Kings of people shall be of her then Abraham you there fell upon his face and laugh and said in his heart shall a child be born unto him that is a hundred years old you ready you ready watch and shall who he already changed his language he doesn't even realize everybody here everybody here he's doubting struggling with his mind but Grace already flipped his language are we reading the same scripture did I fabricate your bubble you don't know how many stuff I was receiving sitting there when he was preaching these are veterans they should I take a bullet I put it I take a bullet out from it if I shoot it it's gonna be tough everybody care praise God he said and shall Sarah change not serious so he already changed Sarah he said Sarah that is 90 years old bear anybody okay watch verse 18. and Abraham say unto God oh that who in other words father this is more easy amen do you know how Ishmael was born he was a nambelief against the word of God and he's bringing the product of dadam belief for God to blessed in the place of the son that God is promising everybody here a permissive will anybody care now Abraham is calling Ishmael anybody here he was talking to God he introduced the name Ishmael so God also upgrade his language God have also to bring out a name have you seen that Abraham started he said Ishmael God said okay I all I told you before you shall have a son I never say the name I told you again that Sarah is going to bury his son I didn't give you the name so since you're getting more precise let me also get more precision [Laughter] you love the Bible what can make you love the Bible like this [Applause] everybody here and God verse 19 and God say Sarah look at his language God already flipped I told you Sarah I'm not going to repeat Sarah again it's already gone no more he said Sarah thou wife shall bear thee a son indeed like the brother timoshong preach indeed in other words that means sisting Sarah anybody here and that shall call his name who now you start with a name I pull up a name now why Ishmael have to hate Isaac and mistreated him because Isaac was the opposite of Ishmael amen so God precise them more clearly you know now I'm not gonna be vague you're going to have a child a son so let me give you even the name so when he's born you don't have to worry about praying for a name everybody you don't have to worry about the name I God give you the name and you carry that name and you give it to the child so go to sleep this promise have nothing to do with you Abraham because to begin with normally you don't have any more strength your age is past and back here I gave you a promise you're gonna have a child when normally you cannot have a child in other words I remove all your power all your abilities out but there was still one ability left for you to do you should have given that child a name I'm gonna take that ability away from you you're not gonna even give him a name in other words Isaac from start to finish it's all God there is nothing in Isaac that have to do with Abraham even the name Isaac he came from God Hallelujah he said his name Isaac and I will establish my Covenant with him for a never lasting Covenant and with his seed after him with God nothing shall be what I don't know what's going in your life but God spoke tonight amen whatever you are going through your life is just a part of the story it must seems impossible God is not telling you about things that make sense to you what God is telling you tonight it's not about stuff that you can go apply because you have a good credit store you're gonna have it that one you can go ahead and do it do you hear me in other words God is not talking about you getting approved for a car when your credit score is 800. God is not talking about you buying a car because you have money in your bank account that's not what God is saying God is speaking specifically tonight about things that you are locked things that you don't know how you're gonna come out of it things that you don't know how even you're gonna have a solution things that when you look you already give up it's already done there is no way something else things that you already bury you put a tombstone on it and you even finish the story those are the stuff God is talking tonight everybody here anybody here so think about those stuff tonight go meditate about those stuff that seems to be impossible think about it you say yes number one okay my child Baxley that one it looks like he can never come back you take that you put on the list do you follow me gather all of them and then tell those problems you hear me tell those problems that With God all of you are gonna be now possible your name are possible do you hear me do you hear me I know what I'm talking about the situation of Lazarus was completed Lazarus was dead and not only dead in the hospital so the pastor can pray for him no they already bury him it's easy to believe Resurrection when you still in the hospital it is easy to believe Resurrection when you still on a casket on a viewing day but when they bury you and they put a tombstone on you it becomes impossible everybody here that's why Marta was thinking about the resurrection in the last day because the last day will pull the people from the tomb Jesus said I'm not talking about that one I am the resurrection [Music] [Applause] everybody here he let that go all the way where men say it is done finish forget about this story it's completed God said that's what I was looking for that's what God is telling you tonight did you get my message did you get what God is telling you because you're going to go home and get it and then start thinking about easy situation or I want to cook at home no you don't need faithful cooking go cook that's not what God is talking tonight if you never cook and you don't know how to cook then you put it on the list God is telling you about the situation that are impossible it is impossible for a woman that is Virgin to give birth Impossible by the spoken word impossible that's what God is doing Sarah 90 years old impossible Abraham impossible Israel coming out of Egypt no Army no weapon slave staying there for 400 years not even a king how are you going to take Israel out impossible situation that's what God is talking about so search your life gather those impossible those hopeless situations that you already put on the shelf that you already shredded they are shredded on the paper but they're not shredded in your memory they're still bothering you go get that situation and bring it tonight and tell him your situation you heard your name today you are no more Sarah yeah you are Sarah because indeed with God nothing will be impossible be together let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we are approaching you again humbly father tonight Lord thanking you for your grace for your love and for your mercy father it takes only Grace to override the human weakness [Music] and then Grace goes with your mercy father to come down and send your servant to remind your children of who they are that just the way we choose our own spouse on this world that's the same way you chose us before the foundation of the world so we already existed in your mind and we are Eternal creatures creature that are above what is called material and natural father and Lord you are reminding us that our life has been already been decided before we were even conceived in our mother's home because that's what you told Jeremiah you say you already called him you already ordained him to be Prophet over the nation so if you already are dead and Jeremiah to be Prophet who can stop Jeremiah for being a prophet because you already spoke and when you spoke everything have to happen exactly to the dot because you spoke in your word that no one ayoda of the word will fail without him being accomplished father may you help your children tonight help all of us to realize the greatness of your power and to understand that we are serving a mighty a big God to whom nothing is impossible father whatever situation that they gave up but down in the subconscious it's still bothering them Sometimes they come across those situation and they are dodging or they are escaping they are avoiding those situation because they already gave up they know that there is no more Redemption there is no more solution to this but tonight you are showing us that not only can you restore Abraham for one woman but when his child when his wife died and was buried you continue to prove to Abraham that I can still give exceedingly and abundantly above all you can ask and think may you Quicken that Faith tonight and may father your children continue to live under great expectation knowing further that it's the time that you are changing the story we humbly ask it father and committed in the name of Jesus Christ Hallelujah [Music] you wait till brother John dismiss you please through it all I've learned to depend upon the sing the chorus again this afternoon [Music] I've learned to trust in Jesus I've learned to trust in God yes through it all through it all I've learned to depend upon his word y'all are dismissed we're gonna sing this a little bit I've had many tears in Sorrows I've had questions for tomorrow there have been times I didn't know right from wrong but in every situation God gave blessed consolation that much
