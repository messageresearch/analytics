Liberty to preach the message amen we we sure appreciate that tonight and if you have your Bibles while you're standing with us we want to go straight to the word we will invite you to the Book of Genesis the book of Genesis the 19th Chapter we have two places we want to read there tonight and then also we're going to read in the book of Hebrews 13 amen but we just want to begin here tonight in

just amen invite the spirit of Revelation into the meeting Heavenly Father Lord As We Gather here on this Wednesday afternoon Lord we are very well aware that we're not here in this building by ourselves but Lord there's a supernatural host in this building father Lord as your Prophet has taught us that Lord there's an angel that would come and would stand in the pull pit Lord that would help the minister to minister your word but then he said that same Angel would go out into the congregation and father it would help your children to believe the word that they were hearing so Lord as we come here tonight they've not come to hear from me or to see me but Lord we've come to see you and to hear from you father both speak and hearer we need to hear a word from you oh god father we're inviting you tonight to come in this building may you drive out every Spirit that's unlike the Holy Spirit oh God and Father may you bring a liberty and an anointing in this building tonight that Lord

many souls for their labor and father may you continue to bless them abundantly father for the stand oh God in which they have taken upon this end time word and we'll be sure to give you all the praise all the honor and all the glory in the wonderful name of our Lord Lord and Savior Jesus Christ we pray and all the Believers says amen amen and amen Genesis chapter 19 we want to read in the first verse uh the Bible here says and there came two angels to Sodom at evening and lot sat in the gate of Sodom and lot seeing them rose up to meet them and he bowed his face toward the ground now I want you to notice here the position where lot is sitting he's sitting in the gate but if we go back to Genesis the 18th chapter yes just one chapter over in Genesis 18 in verse one the Bible here speaks of another man and his name is Abraham yes my brother and the Bible says the Lord appeared unto him in the plains of mamory notice this and he sat in the tent Door In the Heat of the day that's right so it was a Divine appearance and lot was sitting at the gate but here's Abraham's sitting at the tent door now in the book of Hebrews chapter 13 the book of Hebrews the 13th chapter I've just been studying here a few days out of these scriptures and uh speaking along these lines and amen the Lord's just opened up some thought to me so we just share a few things with you tonight in Hebrews chapter 13 and beginning at verse number nine uh Paul here writing says be not carried about with diverse and strange doctrines for it is a good thing that the heart be established with Grace amen and not with Meats which have not profited them that have been occupied there in now I love these words we have an altar sir we're not looking for one and we haven't had one but we have an altar whereof they have no right to eat which serve the Tabernacle for those bodies of those beasts whose blood is brought into the sanctuary by the high priest for sin are burned without the camp now wherefore Jesus also so that he might sanctify the people with his own blood suffered without the gate that's right so Jesus was the the the Beast was taken without the camp but here Paul is bringing it from Old Testament to New Testament and says we'll Suffer Without the gate now watch verse 13 now let us go therefore unto him without the camp bearing his reproach now we could very well go back to Hebrews 6 and read where Paul said let us go on unto perfection we could read Hebrews 12 and let us run the race so it's not stopping or staying where we've been but it's moving forward for here we have no continuing City but we seek one to come amen we ask the Lord this evening to add the blessing to the reading of his word as you can have your seats here this afternoon I want you tonight for just a few moments Amen to speak to you here from these verses of scripture and if I will title this tonight I want to talk to you about this thought of going beyond the gate amen going beyond the gate now I'm drawing this thought from a quote in 1960 brother BR preaches is there anything too hard for the Lord tssa Oklahoma he said did you notice when the Angels come to lot lot was sitting in the gate amen but Abraham was sitting in the door amen the gate comes into the yard but the door goes into the house amen so the gate takes you further than where the door will take you see I like to or rather the door rather will take you further than where the gate will take you he said the gate comes in the yard but the door goes in the house he said i' like to sit in the door Amen on the altar as close as I can get to him he said that's where my expectations is is on the altar amen waiting for his appearing so a prophet amen was identifying amen there were two men amen and the first one was Lot the second one was Abraham amen and each one had a journey but in their Journey one could only go so far but there was another one that could go further one than the other one right amen and then the prophet of God will come along and preach 1964 going beyond the camp he said it seems today to be a day amen of when people are going to be on the camp in everything they're going be on so Amen in science they're going Beyond in education they're going Beyond in religion they're going Beyond amen now listen if the devil is taking his people Beyond amen then you best believe that God is taking his people Beyond amen any of the limitations that the devil could put up on the Church of the Living God now amen he says going Bey on the camp and when you look at the word the word camp in Webster he said it is a place amen with temporary accommodations can we say that together temporary amen it is a place with temporary accommodations amen of a Hut or a tent or other structure amen it is a temporary Dwelling Place amen so let me set to you like this we cannot make a temporary Dwelling Place a a permanent Dwelling Place amen amen it's temporary but it's not permanent can I can I say it to you like this in other words you've got to go there but you cannot stay there you've got to go there but you cannot stay there it's part of your journey amen but it's not your destination amen and and the and and I I love the way the prophet of God brings this out in Genesis 13 he will go back to Abraham and lot and he'll say we find out that there come a Strife amen between lot's hgan and so forth and he said I want to show you a little thing here amen Abraham was an heir to the world now here's Abraham and he is an heir to the world he said but lot amen was a type of the luk horn believer so Abraham is an heir to the world lot is a type of the luk horn believer he was a Believer he had left his homeland to sojourn with God Amen but always never fully surrendered he said that's what's the trouble in the Full Gospel Church tonight along with the rest of them is people who's left the world and they keep out of the world they don't want to go gambling and drinking and carrying on Amen they are a Believer but they have never made a complete surrender amen now you can read that and you can identify that as the second work of Grace amen or the second stage of restoration amen the first one was justification amen and the second one was sanctification listen amen it's a good place to go is sanctification we've everyone got to go there amen but you cannot stay there amen because there's more more to the journey than just justification amen or sanctification but there's a baptism of the Holy Ghost but let me go ahead and say it amen you can't even stay there amen there's more to the believer there's a there there is the word itself amen amen come on lot was a type of the lukor believer amen but Abraham wasn't because he was Heir Amen to lot was Lot was heir to a lukewarm condition amen but Abraham was there to everything amen that God had given him in the Covenant well let me just say it to you tonight Church there's a bride on the earth tonight amen denomination has gone as far as they can go they have settled down with tradition they have settled down with dogmas they have settled down with just having church services amen but there's a bride on the earth tonight who is a Seed of Abraham and she's not anointed just to go to the gates she is Anointed to go to the door and to go through the door amen because she's an heir to All Things amen the prophet of God establishes what lot was he was a type of a Lorn believer again 1959 he said as it was in the days of lot so shall it be in the coming of the son of man he said now does your spirit discern this right remember lot was a type of America amen now lot is a type of the Lorn believer he's also a type of America so a Lorn believer can only go so far and America can only go so far he said it's proven it what was the sin of Sodom it was perversion and this American country of ours the women has degraded themselves so much until natural men sources has been perverted amen so now we have lot as a type of the lukor believer right we have him as a type of America 1964 the prophet of God says amen down there in Sodom we've seen what taken place he said now there was Lot a type of the church natural amen down in Sodom the organization so now we have him as the lukor believer as a type of America and now as a type of the organization amen he said but they got a messenger down there he said that was a Billy Graham and an Oral Roberts amen now don't forget this that Billy Graham could only take his people so far Billy Billy Graham did a good job at preaching repentance he preached the salvation but he could only take him so far and then there was Oral Roberts that would move him from Billy Graham's time Heen into the Pentecostal seed amen but there was more to it than just a Pentecostal seed amen but there was a word seed that had to be sold into the heart of the Bride he said see lot wanted the world Amen so God tore up his world and separated Abraham and lot he said and lot being a type again of a carnal believer amen he's a lukor Believer he's a type of America he's a type of the organization he's a type of a carnal believer who didn't think these things were true so he just went on down into Sodom amen lot did not believe the things that Abraham was talking about so he settled for Sodom amen and he didn't have the real spunk to stand out amen and call what was right right and what was wrong wrong can I sit to you like this God does not want mixers amen God wants separators amen amen Abraham was a separator amen lot was a mixer that's why lot amen could go into Sodom and could be happy amen with the conditions of Sodom amen but it vexed Abraham amen because he knew he was more amen he knew he was air to more than what Sodom had let me just tell you bride I tell you why you cannot get satisfied in Lea I tell you why this world does not satisfy amen the hunger of your soul amen it's because we are citizens of another kingdom we are seeking a city and it has foundations whose city is the maker and the build almighty God let me said as plain as I know how we will not back up and we will not lay down and we will not be satis with temporary conditions when there's a Perfection calling us when there's things that are to be when there's a future home when there's a merit supper of the Lamb there's something Beyond this Dimension and it's calling to the Bride of Jesus Christ come up higher yes sir amen come on up higher come up out of America come up out of lukew condition come up out of carnality amen God called Abraham Amen to a total separation because God requires amen a complete separation from the world yes sir God requires a complete separation from the world now can I can I share something with you tonight yes sir amen don't forget this okay sometimes advancement requires separation that's right yes my brother sometimes advancement requires separation yes my brother don't just suggest it no sir it's not a recommendation no sir it's not an option no it's a requirement yes sir brother BR said no matter what the world says they still want bow to the Modern Trend of modern religion no social gospel for them men there's some that still believe God's holy they believe he requires Holiness he requires the new birth and he requires a separation from sin that is not a suggestion my friend that is a requirement of a holy God requires Holiness he requires a new birth he requires a separation from sin when you separate can I say this when you separate you are separating from something amen amen to go into something that's you are separating from something to something so you're not just separating yourself to be idle and stand alone but you're separating yourself because there's a higher call yes sir yes my brother there's a higher calling upon your life and I'll tell you what the devil does the devil wants to put a pressure on mess people say well you all are just trying to be something you're just trying to preach something deep and you're just trying to be some revelated something no you don't understand we're not lot we're Abraham and there's a city that is calling our name and we cannot stay here and the only way to get there is by Revelation so we're willing to separate from everything contrary to God's word to walk in the provisions of Jehovah amen amen amen when you separate amen you separate from something Amen to something amen don't ever forget that I'm I'm I'm I'm laying some Foundation advancement requires separation yes sir and when you separate you separate from something to something yes sir father said the first man separated himself he said that was Adam and he separated himself from the word to go with his wife so Adam left the word to follow his wife that question whether God kept his word or not he said what a perfect type of the lukor carnal-minded believer today that still wants to cling with that their tradition says instead of taking what the word says amen there's your problem tradition has taking the place of the word amen in the place of the word they would rather stand with tradition he said he was separated to his wife he said and the carnal believer is separated amen from the word to the church the carnal believer is separated from the word to the church but the genuine believer the Abraham believer is separated from the church to the word want go ahead and preach amen it's in your first seal I'm no longer going to call you church I'm going to call you bride amen I'm no longer going to call you church I'm going to call you bride so that you will understand listen your name is not miss church your name is not miss Pentecost your name is Jesus Christ is Jesus Christ and the prophet said that the name of God interpreted is the manifestation of the name of God brother we have not been separated amen from the word to the church we have been separated from the church to the word amen the church lives by tradition uhuh but the bride lives by Revelation amen a separation he said always the word requires total and complete separation every one of us here tonight we're on a journey right amen and there are steps in our journey amen we are on a journey of growth can I say that we're on a journey of growth as long as we are here amen we are growing in Christ there is always room to grow that's why you need the revelation of this message spoken over your life on a continual basis is because you're in a journey and you've got to grow into the fullness of what God has called you to be now you all know that the natural types the spiritual right amen there's a natural human journey and there's a spiritual journey and the natural human Journey begin in your life when you was born amen as an infant and then you grew into a baby and then you grew into a toddler and then you grew into a child and then you grew into a pre-teen and then you grew into a teenager and then you grew into adult amen then you grew into an elder see amen there's a journey and you don't stop growing because there's a fullness that you're headed to Paul says in Ephesians 4:13 he says till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God to a perfect man to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ and watch what Paul says that we henceforth be no more children that's listen friends you you cannot be born and Skip childhood you got to go to childhood but you can't stay in childhood there's a manhood that is a calling you to it amen amen that we be no more children tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of Doctrine by the Slate of men and cunny craftiness whereby they lie and waight to deceive amen but speaking the truth and love Paul says that we may grow up into him in all things which is the head even Christ and then don't you ever forget church that God sent a prophet in this s to preach a sermon called the stature of a perfect man and he built a pyramid and at the bottom of the pyramid it was really wide amen there was a lot of roomen but the closer you got to the Capstone the more narrow the pyramid become because the only thing that go can to can go to headship is perfection Paul said amen lay it not again the foundation of dead word baptism and repentance unto God let us go on unto Perfection but I feel like preaching tonight I want to announce to America I want to announce to Sodom I want to announce to the organizations I want to announce to the carnal Believers that there is an abrahamic Bride on the earth tonight who knows she is air to all things that God has is hers and she will not lay down and she will not quit growing and she will not back up because she knows her potential is in Jesus Christ amen amen that we may grow look at this word grow it means to cause to grow it means to augment it means to increase to become greater I love what the prophet says Born Again Christians amen grow into the stature of Christ as they live they're born again and their lives begin to shape like a baby that's right it takes form and begins to grow the first thing you know here they are in the full stature amen there you are day after day year after year they stay the same see now they come back to the word and he shows you the place of growth is in the word he says if ye abide in me and my words abide in you he said you cannot expect a baby to be born to man it's got to grow to it and we grow in Christ to the full stature not somebody get converted tonight and tomorrow preach the gospel amen but we grow up somebody say grow up we grow up into manhood into the stature of Christ see that's why Pentecostal babies amen could not take this message it was going Beyond a birth it was moving into adoption amen amen it was moving beyond gifts it was moving beyond tongues it was moving beyond emotion it was bringing a stability come on Paul said I ain't got time to teach all this I got to preach it Paul said amen that we be not children tossed to and fro with every wind of doctrin don't get mad at me but somebody that follows every new doctrine that comes around the message is not a manifested son they're still a child there's still an infant they're still a baby what they need to do is settle down somewhere and let the word of God begin to cause them to come to stability in the message of the hour amen now we're always talking about how bad the world's getting right amen but the pr of God said while we're talking about how bad the world is getting he said we're forgetting how powerful the church is becoming at the same time at the same time the world is getting worse there's a bride that's getting stronger brother said like this he said the church is growing that's each age is a lot in the scripture amen God through the holy spirit amen Reveals His word by manifesting it and his showing it's his word brought to pass in the day it's been promised to be brought to pass in listen God is not bringing Noah's promised to pass because this is not Noah's day he's not bringing Moses's promise to pass this is not Moses's day but he's bringing the promise of Elohim to pass in this generation because it's the age when Elohim but returned to the church for the manifestation preach my brother preach can I preach or what the manifestation of the word of God is the Vindication that it is the word that's right don't you ever forget that if God's word is God's word and it's manifested the same one that manifested is the same one that'll vindicate it want me to prove it to you in Genesis 1 he said let there be light let there be light said he he spoke his word and said let there be light he said then there was light he said see had there been no light then we would have automatically known that it was not God's word that's right yes we would have automatically known that it was not God's word but because there was light the light was the Vindication that it was the manifestation of the word of God listen friends I heard a prophet say let there be a bride let there be a messiah let there be an invincible Army I heard a prophet say let there be a squirrel and I give you your two sons and because the two sons was there and because the squirrels was there and because the bride is here I have an infallible right by the almighty God to say this day is this scripture fulfilled in your ears amen we're not looking for the word we are looking after word aen you are the Vindication of the manifestation of the spoken word of God amen amen in the age amen that you're living in I want to say it as plain as I know how God is going to have a mature bride yes sir hell won't stop it I said hell won't stop it no sir unbelievers won't stop it sir reprobates won't stop it sir false doctrines won't stop it there's going to be an adopted bride with check book of ity in this age yes sir I believe as the prophet said we have been children long enough that's right God is going to turn his church into manhood now yes sir we've been babies long enough that's right we've been having to be patted on the back on the don't get mad at me but it's time to grow up yes my brother I said it's time to grow up yes come on church it's time to grow up we ought to be Beyond highill shoes yes my brother we ought to be Beyond makeup yes sir we ought to beond worldly dancing we ought to be Beyond television we ought to be beyond having be begged to come to church yes my brother preach well we might as well preach we here we ought to be Beyond men running off with other men's wives we ought to be beyond all this nonsense Glory I know you don't like it but I'll preach it anyhow we ought to be Beyond this it's time to grow up yes my it's time to move on it's time to come to stability yes sir yes my brother Prophet God said we played and we have Frolic as children but now we're going to have to put away childish things and take on manhood which is maturity amen that's where lot could not go he could not go to maturity he could not go to responsibility he could not go to manhood he stayed in Sodom but there was an Abraham who was air to the world he was going all the way if he had to struggle he would struggle if he had to pray he would pray whatever he had to do he was willing to do it because he was anointed to go all the way yes sir Glory now now now can I take two minutes pre can I take two minutes more than two minutes and break down to you real easy the difference in childhood and manhood go ahead my brother take your time childhood yes sir is a kid that wakes up on Thursday morning uh and they got scratchy throat and they got a little cough and they don't feel the greatest so they go in the in the living room and they say mom they say Mom I don't feel like going to school and mama says okay just go back to bed see there's no responsibility right what's he going to miss a test recess uh lunch uh-huh there's no responsibility that's right you take a man that's right that wakes up with a scratchy throat yes sir and a bad headache yes sir he still goes to work that's right you know why because there's a responsibility there's a house payment there's a car payment there's miles to feed there's bills to pay see when responsibility comes it separates the childhood from manhood that's why the prophet preached a man running from the presence of God because in the presence of God is where man finds responsibility and the prophet said we're all always prone am been to cir responsibility but you know what I say I say what a prophet said we've been babies long enough that's right but come on we might as well preach amen we might as well bring that right on in church amen we wake up on Sunday morning and break a fingernail and the car won't start and we'll go back in house and we'll say well I guess it's just wasn't God's will for me to go to church today you spiritual baby that's right preach you spiritual baby I'll tell you the difference in a spiritual baby and a son of God go ahead you let a Son of God wake up on Sunday morning and the car won't start he'll start calling people and he'll start walking to church because he knows there's a responsibility that is laying upon his life amen to come to the full stature of Jesus Christ there's a Hebrews 10 over his life it says forsake not the assembling of yourselves together brother B said we played his children long enough he said when I was a child I spake as a child because he thought as a child amen but now it's time we begin to think like men and women should hallu for we got to get down to business listen I believe it friends I believe in the spiritual growth of a Believer yes my brother I believe what Peter said when he said we desire as newborn babies desire the sincere milk of the word that she may grow thereby yes sir said you you know the Holy Spirit feeds on the word that's exactly man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God if you just take each day not as just a routine but oh I'd say just to make that your heart craves for it just to sit down each day and read so much out of your Bible you would be surprised what it would do for your spiritual growth amen now I feel that devil pushing back against me well brother Andrew I'm too busy I'm too busy well if you got time for ESPN if you got time for soccer and football preach preach my brother preach if you got time for everything but the house of God you problem is not having time you're telling us where your heart is because wherever your heart is amen wherever your Treasures are there is your heart also listen this may not be what you want to hear but I going what's on my heart we need to get some men around this message to be men again quit being sissified pansies aen amen I'm going preach tonight I think it's time we get some fathers to start doing the praying instead of the mama having to do all the prayer that's exactly right I think we ought to get some fathers pressing to go to the house of God instead of Mama's begging them to you know it's a truth but it's a layout of see and limitation it's a lukew condition and it's stunning the growth of the church Preach my brother preach preach well I ain't got time for prayer time but you got time to keep up with everything in the world if you got time for ESPN you got time for the message of the hour amen amen amen preach come on church we got to grow up sometime or another we got to grow up and realize we're not a bunch of babies amen playing Church we're sons and Daughters of God amen amen I tell you what God desires amen God desires spiritual growth in his church amen more than he does natural growth now don't get mad at me but God is more pleased with spiritual growth yes sir and he is natural growth yes my brother you know why I can say that because he walked off and left the Baptist who was hollowing a million more in 44 and come to a few that was Abraham's type and give them the Promises of the [Music] word now I'm going to say it to you as plain as I know how goad isel's Journey had stages Israel in Egypt Israel in the wilderness Israel in the promised land Israel in the homelands look at Deuteronomy 2 verse one Hallelujah he said we turned and took our journey into the Wilderness by the way of the Red Sea that's right the Lord spake unto me and said we've compassed this Mount sier many days and the Lord spake unto me saying ye have compassed this mountain long enough turn you northward you've been around this mountain long enough it's time to turn and go northward yes sir come on Church PR in other words go be on this mountain there is more to your journey amen yes my brother go beyond this mountain there is more to your journey what you saying and the Red Sea was a part of their Journey brother Steven they had to go there but they couldn't stay there that's right they had to go to mount sier but they couldn't stay there they had to go to the Wilderness but they couldn't stay there because they was ordained to go to the promised land where the milk and honey was flowing aen now think about this preacher Israel was on a journey and brother said by automobile they would have been there in three in an hour and a half that's right automobile would have had them there in an hour and a half he said by foot they would have been there in 3 to 4 days yes sir right but instead he said what they do they wandered for 40 years pre my brother they were shouting at the Red Sea that's right they were dancing at the Red Sea that's right the taskmasters was dead behind them and God said you got to go on uhhuh I mean come on brother Sten we're shouting brother we're dancing surely we finally made it God said that's a stage but there's more to it now let me just tell you what a prophet say that's my brother he said a short Journey amen turned into years of wandering in the wilderness go ahead brother see all because they chose law over Grace he said Grace had provided them a great thing he said it provided them a Passover Lamb that's right it provided them a prophet that's right and it provided them an Angel that's right but Passover lamb was for their sins yes sir the prophet was their instructor and the angel was their gu this Grace had oh God the grace had provided them an escape out of Egypt before they had any law that's right yes my brother before there was a law there was a Grace yes sir oh God yes my brother before there was a law there was a Grace So before they come in the law and they stopped at the law God had a message of Grace that was provided for them that would put them in the greatest Revival they had ever seen this revival they seen the powers of God they seen the sunshine mother the rest of the world was in darkness they seen the mighty hand of God deliver the innocent people they seen all this thing and they still chose law over Grace preach now now I'm just going to say what a prophet he said Israel's journey is a perfect type of the church today amen he said this children of Israel starting on their Journey perfect time for the church today making its way to the glory land don't you believe that we're each day gaining a little ground as we go along uhhuh come on don't get mad at me but you ought to be you ought to be you ought to be three steps ahead of where you were Sunday that's exactly right day by day you ought to be three steps ahead of where you were Sunday amen come on church amen and tomorrow you ought to be a step ahead of where you are tonight amen and by the time you get here Sunday you ought to be four steps ahead of where you are right now come on this is not a journey where we stop and we make temporary places permanent we are growing daily in the revelation of the word of God Amen I tell you what the prophet said he said we're moving up yes sir we're not going down we're moving up Sir see I want to say this as plain as I know how God's church is not going down we are moving up amen you know how I can say that is because God foreen he ordained a church that was to appear before him in other words he's not going to come down amen for you to appear before him he's going to come down and appear and his appearing is going to be the food that's going to cause you to grow up to meet him oh come on Church in the Rapture tape he's not going to put a foot back on this Earth he said we will meet him in the air he saider I'm waiting on him to come down he's already come down the shout is the dissension of the mighty Angel Christ we have got the message come on friends we're not looking for the ladder we've got the ladder we're not looking for the way we're in the way amen don't you don't you ever forget this okay your objective is the rapture don't miss understand me the message is not your objective the Rapture is your objective uh-huh the message is God's provided way to get you to your objective amen amen come on church amen the message is the only way to get from here into Rapture amen amen amen Mark Luther had a part but then he moved on to Wesley brother said Along come the Pentecostals moving up into higher Heights and now he says when the Brethren receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost they said this is the summit this is all of it but Brethren that's wrong see there is no Summit to God's power we just move on and on and on yes sir it's the unlimited resources of God that has never been tapped yet there's blessings and power that we know nothing about it's never even been revealed to archangels amen it's never been revealed to archangels amen is laying just ahead for his church that will believe yes sir direct quote so let's move up and claim our rights that's right that's right let's believe this plus how much more we can hear from God can I say this amen we are the adoption people yes sir we are the adoption people it's not in the future we are the people that God has prepared and anointed to believe all things yes my brother look at Romans 8:19 for the earnest expectation of the creature amen waited for what sir the manifestation of the sons of God can I slow down to read this cuz it's a powerful quote he said God hid it from the eyes of the wise and prudent and promised to reveal it to the sons of God in the last days when the sons of God would be made manifest when God's sons that rejoiced with him before the foundation of the world when the Great revelation of the godhead and would be brought down in the last days he would manifest those things to the sons of God you know the scripture teaches that and here we are amen it's no longer in the future here we are amen that's the reason God is opening the things to us God is bringing his sons into manifestation oh God I'm going to preach here he's going beyond the limitations amen he's going beyond the limitations of any human knowledge and then way into the spiritual Revelations and bringing it down amen come on don't get mad at me amen but you manifested Sons is what is pulling the Revelation out of your pasture out of the ministry amen amen because we're seeking for a city that has foundations whose Builder and maker is God come on little bride you come from God and you got to go back to God amen amen come on you come from God and you got to go back to God and this message is the transportation from the mind of God amen amen amen I feel I feel like praising him do you realize what you're doing in these Services you're breaking Beyond limitations you're breaking Beyond denominations you're breaking Beyond World governments you're breaking beyond the religion and you're breaking into the mind of God and you're pulling the Revelation aen you're literally pulling the Revelation into your body that's changing your body aen body change and Revelation is in the house tonight it's in the church tonight we're not waiting for it it's here she's bone of his bone she's life of his life she's power is power she is him yes sir Glory Revelation to change your body is in your body amen amen amen amen oh God have mercy preach I know what Satan's desire is please my brother his desire is to stunt your growth and hinder your progress that's right cuz he does not want you to go into the full promise right of the full land right now Paul in Hebrews 13 uhhuh goes all the way back to the Old Testament go ahead my brother preacher and he pulls a top yes sir from the Old Testament yes sir and shows that the sacrifice yes sir of the blood and bulls and goats that's right amen I don't have time to get into all of that take your time but there's a powerful thing here amen Paul writes about he in Hebrews 9 he writes about the blood uhhuh right yes sir are you hearing me and the book of Hebrews is the most debated book in the entire Bible goad on who wrote it they believe Moses wrote Genesis more than they believe Paul wrote Hebrews but in the end time God would send a prophet that would say listen oh God say listen I believe that Paul wrote the book of Hebrews now some people even around the message brother Steven they say well I've been reading this philosopher and I've been reading this kind amen but but I'm the God I'm the guy that if a prophet said it was Paul it's yes sir yes my brother yes my brother I'm sorry I'm the guy that if a prophet said was Apostle Paul I'll put my voice with the voice of AIC Prophet say it was Paul yes sir yes you know why because the book of oh God I'm preaching another sermon the book of Hebrews has the key yes my brother brother BR said it's the key book of all of Paul's letters yes my brother said the key to the entire Cannon of scripture is found in the book of Hebrews the 13th chapter you know what he said he said it's Jesus Christ the same yesterday today forever yes sir you know what GL a few years ago brother Stephen A a few years ago we was up in Pennsylvania brother Sean and I for some meetings and we was on a campground and this Church of Christ preacher come to brother Shawn and he said sir you all believe in miracles brother Sean said we sure do he said he said we don't believe in miracles he said there are no more miracles he said well what do you believe he said well we believe the Bible he said well your Bible says that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever you know what that man looked at even said he said that scripture don't even make sense he said go read the book of Hebrews the 13th chapter right he said and you'll be reading through there and I did it he said you'll be reading through there about about all different kinds of things and then all of a sudden out of nowhere Paul just says Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever and really brother Steven if you're reading it it seems like it don't even fit in there preach preacher you know why because it took a prophet that's right it took a prophet yes sir abam said a prophet brings the key to the generation amen now come on y'all if you want somebody to get in your house and you're not there you leave them a key but you don't take the key and walk through the neighborhood saying on the front porch under the mat is the key under the front porch under the m is the key but oh God but you you yourself you take the key and you hide the key and then you call the person that you want to come into your house and you reveal to them where the key is hidden and then they walk and then they walk up there and they pull the mat open the whole world don't know where the key is the neighborhood don't know where the key is but there's an elected selected man chosen person that knows where the key is 2,000 years they have been trying to get in God's house and they don't know the key but God would send a prophet in the last days would say the key has been hidden in the book of Hebrews Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever glory glory and there was a bride who picked up the key but she walked to the door she went beyond the gate yes sir she went Bey on the yard yes sir she's in the house [Applause] Glory she's in the house glory to God but we might as well not stop she's in the house yes my brother and when she open the door she found a three room house amen she found a living room yes sir where you relax that's right she found a kitchen that's right where you eat that's right but then she found a bedroom ah pre she was not a blessing bride oh God glory to God she was not a blessing bride no sir she went to the living room she went into the kitchen but she went all the way to the bedroom to the bedroom yes sir and come into relationship when she's no longer a headless woman she has now got headship she's not flirting with her headship she's not dating her headship she is married to her headship it's an invisible Union amen glory god come on Abraham come on Royal seed there's more than the gates there's more than the yard yes my brother preach preach my brother youall know I'm telling the truth preach it was misplaced until a prophet found it thank you Lord preach wonderful preach my it was hid in there yes sir but he said here's the Keystone amen of the entire Bible amen glory brother Steven can I prove it to you preach my brother can I prove it to you Church pre Hebrews 13 he writes about social duties he writes about marriage how sacred he writes about how there's duty to ministers and then right between writing about the duty to ministers and the doctrinal stability he says Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever now don't get mad at me okay Luther didn't find that that's right Wesley didn't find that amen amen Charles Spurgeon didn't find that I'm this close to it I as well preach Charles Spurgeon didn't find it so somebody tell me why that we got message preachers studying and quoting Spurgeon prach PR preach preach quoting Spurgeon and won't quote a prophet of God don't get mad at me but Charles Spurgeon was a cigar smoking preacher that's right he smoked a cigar went home and said I'll smoke a pipe as an incense unto God he was a cigar smoking preacher yes he had a lot of good things to say but he was still a part of the camp of unclean living but in the end time God sent you a prophet who could even smoke a he couldn't even drink a drink a whiskey he couldn't even date a girl ungodly because he was called under a separation vow to call a bride outen amen come you can't be joined to something and separate somebody from it preach my brother you cannot be joined to something and separate a group of people from it don't get mad at meach don't get mad at me my brother not from here we've seen that nonsense we've seen it all over the world oh we believe the message we preach the message but down in their heart they're married to some Roman system preach my brother and no wonder they can't fully bring you out is because they themselves haven't come out they're still in bed with the Roman Catholic Church that's [Applause] right pleas put me on the internet do what you want to that's right my brother never lead a bride to Perfection marrying and and flirting with denominations no sir no sir well we might as well preach for this the only reason this Prophet could take you out is because he himself come out yes my brother he himself he was not flirting with them no sir he was not dating them no sir he was not looking at them and saying they got a lot more than we got we got more miracles than we got sir no he was saying come out of her my people amen amen and if you got the guts to preach this message say what a prophet said amen come out of that system and flee it like the plague yes my brother preach Glory well I don't know I'm here I might as well preach preach my brother are you hear me a prophet escaped it he got out of it yes sir remember the brother B said the little girl got off the bus and she met her friend and he said her friend and her walked off and ignored her mama remember that he said the reason she ignored her mama preach now was because her mama had scars on her face ah please her mama had scars on her face and she walked by her mama and brother said the bus driver couldn't take it he said young woman get over here he said do you realize when your mama was your age she was twice as pretty as you are amen she was twice as pretty as but because of you he said do you know what Happened One Night your house caught on fire and she ran out of the fire she separated herself that's right she escaped the fire that's right but when she got out there she remembered you was still in there so she grabbed a blanket she wrapped her head in it and she ran back in the fire and found you when she found you she realized she had nothing to wrap you in so in order for you not to be scarred she unwrapped her face and she wrapped you she wrapped you in the in the in the in the towel and she escaped the fire said and today she Bears the scars so that you could be beautiful go ahead now preach now go ahead now she Bears the scars so that you could be beautiful go ahead you don't know where I'm going goad that was not just a story no sir there was a prophet that's right in the last days that knew the fire was coming upon denomination yes my brother fire was burning up everything that's right and he escaped it that's right he got out but then he remember there was a bride that's right that was trapped in there yes sir so he took the word and he wrapped himself in the word and he ran in there and found you in the fire denomination he found you in the fire of denomination yes sir and when he found you he realized there was nothing nothing to wrap you in that he could come out unscarred so he loved you so much that he unwrapped himself he wrapped you in the word preach and he bore the scars to preach the godhead he bore the scars to preach the seals he bore the scars to preach serpent seed but you

and baby and saddled up a mule and took off to Egypt and they said where you going Moses he said going to Egypt to take over that's right they said it's a Onan Invasion brother said the difference was he said he had had met God amen amen and there was a people that was trapped in Egyptian and here comes Moses right with a pillar of fire right and announces to them the I am that I am has met me amen and there's more to your life than being baptized in titles preach my brother there's more to your life than Fallen women preachers am there's more to your life than just putting your name are you hearing me my brother come on Church don't you forget this is Israel Israel met God by the way of a Vindicated Prophet whose name was mesen amen what what the prophet of God said yes sir remember sometimes advancement this is me advancement requires separation ex and God told Moses separate yourself and then he just swallowed up the Dayan and chorus he said now watch all the signs and wonders Vindicated his presence he said now the man made himself a camp a camp of creed uhhuh are y'all ready for this preach my brother can can can you take this quote go ahead swallow it a camp of creed and tradition not God's Camp of his word uhhuh a camp of their own god brother says God speaking of God he had to leave them for he is the word amen don't you ever forget this part yes sir he cannot stay where people are taught out of his word amen amen amen so the minute you bring Psych you to a pull pit that's it that's it the minute you bring religious ideas to a pull pit apart from a Vindicated Prophet is the minute you put God outside of the camp that's exactly right preach my brother he cannot stay in the camp he can't he never did he must stay exactly where his word is amen when God come among them he walked in but their Traditions had so took his place among them that he was a stranger to them the traditions of the fathers ahh tradition are you ready for this tradition they were washing pans and they were grooming their hair and they were wearing certain buttons on their coat uhuh uh oh God so they were no longer just called Christians they were wearing tape boy pins and come on and I'm a I'm a this and I'm a that no no clicks butam said this he said one said I'm a staunch Pharisee and the other one is a sadducee and that it all taking the place of the word of God Among those men till when God come to Vis that he was a foreigner may I say this with love and respect but to drive it home it's the same thing today today it hasn't changed a bit right when he comes among the people in his power and manifestation to prove that his word is the same yesterday and forever that's right because he is the word amen the people says fortune teller be El above Jesus only something like that some class youed somewhere but it has to be that way amen amen amen can I can I leave you this go ahead my brother traditional teaching preach my brother preach my brother apart from the word preach my brother crucifies the effect of the manifested Vindicated word of the hour repeat it again my brother traditional teaching yes my brother apart from the word crucifies the effect of the manifested and Vindicated word amen let it speak for itself that's it that's it that's it when the light showed up they didn't have to stand there explain it HH huh no no sir does God keep his word well there's the light am amen that's it and Jesus said amen you make the word of God of none effect through your tradition amen amen look at this word effect to render void are you ready for this yes to deprive the force and Authority so tradition literally deprives the message of its force and Authority that's exactly right that's exactly right well I'm this close to it exactly right they desired a denomination tradition in the stead of the true word being manifested and prove that it's God amongst the people are y'all ready for this yes sir by science through pictures a light the same Angel of the Lord the pillar of fire amen so they take this down preach my brother and they put up Hoffman's head of Christ confusion now don't get mad at me I believe in Hoffman's head of Christ yes sir but a prophet said that's a painting that's exactly right that is a painting that's an original that's exactly right he said that's the closest thing to what he looked like when I saw him in the saes brush field that's right that's and his hair blowing in the wind right that's right he said that's the closest thing so what they do brother is they take the Vindicated down and they put up a painting and say now let's all just focus on Jesus so what they do is they take the fire out of the church am and they replace it with a painted fire that's but but don't you ever forget this okay we're not following a pillar of ice it's a pillar of fire aen it's a Vindicated manifestation amen come on Church the same God that was with Moses the same God with Paul the same God with William Brandon he said the same one that lived on the earth in the body of Jesus Christ has come upon his people in the last day where scientists took the picture of it the church has seen it it's thoroughly identified by tapes and everything around and around the world yes my brother yes sir yes sir Glory they think I'm closing they think their Traditions is of God but it won't stand up with a word and neither does God vindicate it to be [Music] right the Jews did when the veil was ran and bought brought God into Plain View hanging on the cross he was in plain view but they couldn't see it could it be possible amen that the Gentiles is did the same thing when they've had the church ages of the Son of God but when now the veil of this denomination and things the veil of tradition that we've got since Pentecost when the church Traditions has been rent the things that people said days of Miracles has passed and God has took the veil off of it and brought it in plain view amen amen and the ready to crucify it again yes sir so two th000 years ago right he walked up Mount Calvary goo's Hill laid down on a cross give up his life right they nailed his hands right they nailed his feet they driven his side they crown of thorns on his head hung him up and said crucify Hallelujah today they bring the message of the hour the word of God ream said they lay it on a wooden pull pit and with those denominational Creed nails they crucify the word of God [Music] aresh amen amen why because their Camp has set its boundary it wouldn't let them it wouldn't let him in the camp and it wouldn't let anybody go out to him pre now watch this the reason they hated him is he was a breaker of their tradition that's exactly right he was an upsetter that's exactly of their churches that's exactly right to them he was a fortune teller he said and I believe if he come among us today he would be the same thing to us for we have tradition we have denomination we can't even get along with one another why there's only one place that a man can get along that's under the shed blood right now don't get mad at me I told you I'm closing on tradition and I am Jesus walked to the Feast of Passover they're holding kosher bread in commemoration of what God done for him brother BM said like this he said this was at the Feast of Passover and Jesus walked in their midst and they were drinking from a fountain and holding the kosher in commemoration of the manner that fell in the wilderness and Jesus cried right out in the midst and said I am the bread of life your father drank Mana or drank water out of a rock and they're every one dead right right see what was once a blessed symbol uhuh had become a blinding tradition that's the problem right there can I can I can I leave you this and I'm going home don't ever let anybody put any pressure on you when your righteous indignation Rises up when the message is being Cru crucified in your presence thank you my [Music] brother thank you come on church we might as well face it amen face it people people get now now I'm not against streaming not against streaming okay but people get on streaming and do and say things and send it in churches and then pastors like brother stepen have to get up and correct it and then all of a sudden they've got the wrong spirit and they don't love right right no I tell you why it's because you're not sending in your tradition that's exactly right into the Bride of Jesus Christ amen and the Bethlehem dwellers holding their peace amen we've held our peace long enough we've taken a backseat long enough we've let you get up and say well we need to get people to Christ and not the message long enough we're done with them Traditions let the word of God Reign in power and manifestation and Revelation and Vindication in the midst of the Church of the Living God Amen Amen Let our musicians come Amen Let our musicians come we will not back up tradition any longer no sir we will not bow our knee to tradition no sir we're not Baptist no we're not Pentecostals no we're not methodists no we're Believers amen we have a right to this word amen Glory somebody says why do y'all get up there and hark about the message we ain't harking we're preaching get it [Music] [Applause] right can I tell you why that when somebody begins to crucify the effect of this message in your presence something Rises up within you can I prove it to you by the Bible because Revelation 18 the same voice of Revelation 18:4 is in Malachi 4 is in Revelation 10:7 is revelation 3 amen the voice of the seventh angel on Earth echoing the message from Heaven and the message from Heaven is come out of her my people right can I tell you the very next chapter from Revelation 18 is revelation 19 and the prophet says when he comes he's going to be called the word of God riding upon a white horse and the followers of heaven will be behind him see that's why we can't hold our peace is CA we've got Captain Jesus's jeans on the inside of us and the prophet said what he done will do what he done will do you know what he done he broke the denominational Veil he broke the veil of tradition he broke the veils that was hiding from from you he broke the veils of Pride you King's Daughters act like it live like it he broke every Veil no matter what PhD lld says if it's contrary to that Bible he broke that Veil we've crossed the Riven Veil we're on the other side now and you will see if you'll just do that break those old traditions and things and come to him you will see him standing the mighty conqueror the Word of Promise for this age made manifest you'll see the Mighty God unveil you'll see him right here Among Us unveiled the Mighty God Amen un conquered by Traditions amen amen he's not conquered by traditions and neither is his bride amen won't you to stand to your feet tonight glory to [Applause] God it's a powerful message I believe it's a powerful message are you hearing me tonight it's a powerful message the message of the hour is the plum line for the [Music] Bride Can I can I ask you something brother how hard would it be to just getting back to saying what a prophet said how hard would it be to just getting back to saying what a prophet said and just moving on well brother Andrew we don't need no just say what he said and just move on that's it now I know what you're saying you're saying brother Andrew what in the world are you talking about I tell you what I'm talking about I'm talking about that tradition from denomination that's trying to creep in the ring of this message and crucify it come on we ought to get out of these camps we ought to get back in the camp of God's word and say what a prophet said amen and move on Amen we don't need you to explain it why he said it how he said it who he said it to the reason why you think he said it come on Church people people people get all brother brother Steven they get all wed up about people shouting and dancing in church and forget we literally got a picture of a prophet with his leg hanging over the pull pit if you want to see it I got it with his leg hanging over the pull pit shouting and dancing in the service preaching well bless God we don't need a bunch of pictures around the church and literally forget we got a prophet standing in brandham Tabernacle with that picture behind him listen Friends unconquered by tradition amen unconquered by tradition amen y'all forgive me I got a I got a whole message here I didn't get to it but I'll say this it's a new land am and we ain't doing things in this land like you did in your denomination no sir no sir it's a new land amen it's changed our way of thinking amen it's changed our way of talking amen it's changed our way of preaching amen it's changed our church order ahen we look at things different amen we've gone beyond the Gat amen we've gone beyond your limitations we've gone beyond your hindrances we broke the sound barrier it's unlimited Revival it's unlimited anointing it's unlimited manifestation unlimited power it's unlimited Revelation it's unlimited Miracles it's unlimited power of God hallelujah hallelujah we broke the veil we're on the other side where all things are possible yes my brother we see him amen the Mighty God amen glory Heavenly Father we worship you tonight in the sanctuary father I believe I'm talking to some Abrahams here tonight I believe I'm talking to some manifested Sons and Daughters of god father they've gone beyond the veil they've gone beyond the Traditions they've gone beyond the denominational way of doing things they separated themselves Lord they themselves haven't done it you've done it Lord your Prophet said it's a sign of Separation amen a sign of Separation father I pray that you would increase the courage of every word believer here father there's such a pressure in these last days Lord men have through the years have blazed Trails for new revelation they've left the confines of the word of God and what a prophet taught and Lord because they think the things brother BR said are a little too radical or they're a little too far out there they're trying to find a more refined and Polished way to approach the people of God but Lord we're not compromisers we're not chicken-hearted Eagles we're Eagles through and through and we'll hunt for our Mana we'll dig through 47 to 65 we're not ashamed of anything we find if a prophet said it we'll stand with it because Lord we're riding behind you the word of God lord we have an altar thank you and it's not an altar of tradition it's an altar of Revelation and Lord at that altar we come and because we're not coming to the altar out of tradition we're coming by revelation we lay our lives down and Lord you take your word and you cut away Pride you cut away arrogance and you cut away intellectualism and you cut away formalities and you cut away personalities you you cut away clicks and you cut away camps and you cut away ways of saying things you cut that all away Lord and you show your Eagles the word of God for the hour the manifested Vindicated word and they rise up in the power of Revelation and they begin to walk they begin to walk walking in power walking in Authority father I pray for every believer here tonight Lord father I know what this church has come through and what they've had to stand against but father you didn't separate them and leave them idle out in the wilderness but Lord you separated them from something to something Lord you separated them from something to something and that's this unlimited rise Revival Lord the devil's done everything he could to shut this pastor up in this church but there're still sounding Out the voice of Revelation they're still digging to the word of God and establishing their hearts and lives under what a prophet is taught father may they never lose the ability to be taught by the message of the hour father I pray Lord you would give them courage Lord if there be some children here that have not turned from childhood to manhood Lord may you give them the grace tonight to grow up into you Lord father you sent a prophet in this generation with the key to our growth Lord I love you and I thank you for your grace and your mercy and I pray Lord you would give every believer here the strength to come out of tradition traditional ways traditional teachings traditional views and come back to the landmark the home homeland of the church the message of the hour in Jesus name we pray in Jesus name we pray do you love him tonight do you love him tonight how many says I broke the tradition I broke the veil of tradition I'm on the other side now I'm in the camp of his presence I'm in the camp of his word

have to stop he said sir you make me want to preach again he said sir he said I see what's wrong with you you're having knee trouble he said but Jesus Christ is your healer do you believe it didn't call the man's name or nothing brother Stephen for probably a month now this knee's just been killing me could even hardly walk on it harly preach get up or down and while I was driving down the road I heard the voice of the seventh angel because what he was doing was he was introducing Elohim Elohim still here and I said Lord I receive it amen I feel good tonight amen Elohim is here amen we've gone beyond the limitations amen come on church amen he was not building a oh God he was not building a platform for another impersonation of the Messiah sign he said the word is the dis earner he got your attention to introduce you to the word and he said now I'll I'll decrease and he'll increase listen this ernment still here the word does everything if you go outside of the camp to find the answer you'll get in trouble but the word is here amen and you're in the new land amen you've gone beyond the gate lot you're not lot you're Abraham you're heir to All Things brother Steven would you

and you can leave over here in North Carolina amen here we have a free Pulpit when we preach the message of the hour whatever brother Bram say we quoted here Amen brother brandham lost so many sleeps he could not stay with his family he was away from his family he bore so many scars just to deliver this message didn't even have a life at all he have to leave brother Bram say he have to be in a what isolationist or something he use a word like that he have to be alone because of the ministry that he is taken he need to be somewhere hunting but he was not even he hunting he was praying over there he did all of that and die because of this message and how can we be ashamed of the message amen I don't even know why people fool around churches that are playing those games if you know a church that don't want to quot the prophet just don't go please put me Brother David put the Brother David thank you very much he worked so hard he he he streamed the whole service through his telephone so that everybody at home can see thank you very much brother David so you can turn the telephone toward me if you find the church I thought somebody recently I say since what I went through I have zero tolerance I'm sorry I have zero tolerance when it comes to the message of the hour if I heard you even saying because I can detect speeches now among preachers when I even decode a little speech of a Preacher like this you will never preach here you will never preach in this PO you can preach elsewhere you can watch them if you want but not me I don't play around with my heart amen I rather listen to brother Bram then listening to you amen why are we standing quoting Charles Spurgeon Charles Spurgeon we have so many quotes in the message that we can quote withing Charles what is going [Applause] on you can't get away from a breastfeed they breastfeed you and you still walking you you are in elementary you still come back and say mama I need to be breastfeed you need to be win from those kind of stuff amen here we want Malachi 4 just come preach Malachi 4 that's it denominational suffer just to get a sermon they have to copy one and another watch this one watch this one and copy and go repeat so and so sermon you don't have to copy it's over there in the message more more than 1,000 message and one message you can preach it for for for for 3 [Applause] years I don't know what's going on with preaching you want to preach they say well when you preach in this church do not quote the prophet don't go to that church no no no no brother we need to keep uh I mean uh Brotherhood you in so and so Church you quote the message when you go some else you don't want to quote the message to to please the pastor are we after money are we looking for money no cut it off stay where we are not ashamed of the message even where what you think brother BR made an error I will identify with it if you come you say you know that brother brandham wanted to kill a police officer when he was not safe I would say yes I know that story and I can even quote that story from the pulpit because whatever Abraham did he lied we put it back on the Bible and we can still cot it so I don't see anything to hide about brother Bram I will put it all on display because we know he was not a man it was God that Vindicated himself in a Ministry of a prophet so stop playing around oh it's a fellowship over there watch the church watch the church do they believe the message is the pastor Sol in the message who is preaching there if you not sure don't [Applause] go Lord if they preaching the message they are Somewhere listening I mean somebody who solid in the message go ahead and fellowship with them I have many people here that watch brother child did I ever tell you not
