[12:11] don't mind standing with me just a
[12:12] minute we'll
[12:14] see if there's any prayer requests that
[12:16] aren't written down
[12:24] [Music]
[12:29] i had two things this week um
[12:33] there's a charter school by the house
[12:36] and um
[12:37] back when uh school was shut down
[12:41] uh
[12:42] it was closed nobody went in there until
[12:44] july
[12:46] and i got a call this week they had a
[12:49] water heater leaked and flooded a whole
[12:52] big area
[12:53] and um
[12:55] guy to call me
[12:57] they're
[12:58] doing all the repairs
[13:00] well um i'm gonna be doing all the
[13:02] floors
[13:03] and it's uh
[13:05] and it's pr it's a really big job uh
[13:07] really good money
[13:09] so i believe
[13:11] the lord caused that water heater to
[13:13] leak
[13:15] you know
[13:16] to flood that place
[13:18] so i can get this job
[13:22] [Applause]
[13:32] the other thing is um
[13:35] there's two uh little shopping complexes
[13:38] i take care of in town
[13:41] and uh
[13:42] i have a shed there where i keep all my
[13:44] cleaning stuff and everything but i had
[13:46] to keep walking back and forth different
[13:48] things i need
[13:50] well the other night i was in there
[13:52] and i called my wife i said do you ever
[13:55] see a one of these little cleaning carts
[13:57] on

[14:15] forget them all but
[14:17] she said i have never seen one of those
[14:18] on it well i said if you see one um let
[14:22] me know
[14:22] so i can put all my stuff on there and
[14:24] i'll have to keep walking back before

[14:33] whatever comes out of this mouth
[14:35] is what
[14:36] the lord will manifest
[14:39] so i go home after and she says

[14:54] says well
[14:55] i said i spoke it
[14:57] and the lord put it there

[15:03] wholeheartedly
[15:05] that we need to start speaking these
[15:07] things

[38:20] let's go to the book of ezekiel chapter
[38:23] one
[38:30] last week was longer
[38:34] and i apologize i had to meet a certain
[38:37] point to make sure you get the first
[38:40] stuff there are two staves so we want to
[38:43] make sure you understand one then we can
[38:46] move to the second one so
[38:48] apologize
[38:50] not in uh
[38:51] intent to drag it but to make sure we
[38:55] reach a certain point and we get it
[38:58] amen how many
[39:01] have listened
[39:03] or were there when we preached the
[39:04] mystery of the tree heaven
[39:09] only few people
[39:12] can you raise your hand high
[39:16] the mystery of the tree heaven
[39:19] do you remember that
[39:21] do you remember that pretty good
[39:23] yeah because we stopped short somewhere
[39:26] and never finish it so i want to make
[39:28] sure if the majority of the church
[39:31] didn't get it
[39:33] so we probably need to start back zero
[39:36] and make sure nobody is left behind
[39:40] right
[39:41] yeah for some it might be a little bit
[39:43] of review then we kick in
[39:45] instead of me dropping on part three and
[39:48] you like
[39:49] gps lost
[39:50] [Laughter]
[39:53] gps signal loss
[39:55] ezekiel chapter 1 verse 26 if you're
[39:58] there you can say amen
[40:00] remember last week we read verse chapter
[40:03] one we started from the beginning you
[40:05] saw the caribbeans they were driving a
[40:07] chariot and you understand the wheels in
[40:10] the middle of the wheel
[40:12] so now everybody should be familiar with
[40:14] a wheel in the middle of the wheel
[40:16] it's not a mystery anymore remember the
[40:19] sounding of the seven angel
[40:21] all the mysteries
[40:23] must be
[40:25] revealed
[40:26] ezekiel chapter 1 verse 26
[40:29] and above the firmament that was over
[40:32] the head this is the caribbean you
[40:34] remember that
[40:36] was the likeness of a throne so above
[40:39] the caribbeans they were thrown
[40:43] carrying
[40:45] something they were carrying the throne
[40:46] of god if you remember last week
[40:50] as the appearance of sapphire stone
[40:53] and upon the likeness of the throne
[40:56] in other words when you look at that
[40:57] throne
[40:58] was the likeness as the appearance of a
[41:01] man
[41:03] above upon it you might be seated
[41:06] so here
[41:08] just a quick
[41:10] recap from last week
[41:13] we understand that the caribbeans were
[41:15] carrying
[41:17] god
[41:18] which in the old testament was
[41:20] represented as the ark of the covenant
[41:24] because above the ark of the covenant
[41:27] was the mercy seat
[41:29] and on that mercy seat we have two
[41:31] caribbeans and right in the middle of
[41:33] the caribbean that's where god
[41:36] uses
[41:37] that place that specific spot as the
[41:39] throne of god
[41:41] so now we found out that the actual real
[41:45] throne of god when he was moving he was
[41:47] moving by four wheels
[41:49] four caribbeans they were carrying god
[41:52] and above that firmament there was like
[41:54] a firmament like heaven that's why we
[41:57] might need to touch on the mystery of
[41:59] the three heaven so when we say
[42:02] firmament heaven you know what it means
[42:04] in the scripture
[42:06] so above those caribbeans were like a
[42:09] heaven
[42:10] and above the heaven there where there
[42:12] was a
[42:13] throne and on that throne
[42:16] somebody sat there
[42:18] so we have the caribbeans
[42:21] this is a chariot
[42:22] with wheels
[42:25] right
[42:26] we got kerry beams right there
[42:28] and above the caribbean they were like
[42:30] in heaven
[42:31] and above that heaven there was like a
[42:34] throne
[42:35] a chair and on that throne
[42:37] somebody sat there
[42:40] right
[42:42] praise the lord
[42:44] verse 27
[42:46] and as so as the color of amber
[42:50] so the person
[42:51] that sat here
[42:53] have a color of amber remember when
[42:56] ezekiel saw this vision at first he saw
[43:00] that there were a fire in the middle
[43:02] there was like whirlwind then there were
[43:05] fire splashing up but right in the
[43:07] middle of the fire there were a little
[43:09] fire like an ember which we know it's
[43:12] the pillar of fire now when the
[43:15] description becomes a little bit more
[43:17] clear we found out that four caribbeans
[43:20] came out of it and out of those feral
[43:22] four caribbeans there was a heaven above
[43:25] the heaven a throne on that throne that
[43:28] fire was in the middle in other words
[43:30] the fire that first appeared like in the
[43:33] middle of the whirlwind was not really
[43:36] in the middle it was above
[43:38] the caribbeans everybody clear
[43:41] the caribbeans or cherubims whichever
[43:44] one works
[43:45] and i saw as the color of amber
[43:48] as the appear of fire around the bad
[43:52] inside from the appearance of his loans
[43:56] if you want if you notice he says he is
[43:59] this is a man
[44:00] but when you look at this man
[44:03] the appearance look like a man but they
[44:06] measure this man
[44:08] from the launch everybody clear
[44:11] they didn't measure him from the head
[44:14] remember when we spoke about one of the
[44:16] seven engine with the seven valve
[44:18] that either the belt was where on the
[44:21] loins or the belt was put on the peps
[44:24] right
[44:25] but here the measurement is coming from
[44:27] the lungs
[44:28] so when ezekiel look at that man from
[44:31] the loins up
[44:33] right
[44:34] so if that man appeared today
[44:37] we must know where his loins are
[44:39] to measure him
[44:42] right
[44:45] but he looked like fire
[44:47] how are you going to see the lungs in
[44:49] the fire
[44:51] praise the lord
[44:53] he said from the appearance of his loins
[44:56] even upward
[44:58] and from the appearance of his lungs
[45:02] even downward as so as he were the
[45:06] appear of fire the appearance of fire
[45:10] and he had brightness round about it so
[45:13] when they look
[45:15] at this man
[45:17] this creature
[45:18] that looked like amber fire
[45:21] the color of amber
[45:23] if you take it from the launch going up
[45:26] this word and down this way
[45:28] all the way he looked like fire
[45:31] in other words when you look at this man
[45:33] even though he looks he have
[45:36] like
[45:37] the
[45:37] appearance of a man but he looked like
[45:40] fire
[45:41] but that fire is not like your fire
[45:45] he have a specific color which is the
[45:47] color of ember
[45:50] right
[45:51] praise the lord
[45:53] verse 28 as the appearance of the bow
[45:58] that is in the cloud so not only does it
[46:01] look like the ember but we have a
[46:04] rainbow coming up from there like a
[46:07] covenant
[46:09] what is the name of the lord
[46:11] is in the cloud in the day of rain
[46:14] so was the appearance of the brightness
[46:17] around the bottom around the back
[46:20] this was the appearance of the likeness
[46:22] of the glory of the lord so if the glory
[46:26] of the lord appeared today
[46:29] that glory when he appears is going to
[46:32] appear like fire
[46:35] make sure it makes sense and that fire
[46:38] must have the color of ember
[46:40] right
[46:41] and that fire must look like a man
[46:45] and when you look at that fire up and
[46:47] down it look like a man
[46:51] and when you see that fire you must be
[46:54] sure the kerry beams are around there
[46:57] and they are carrying the throne of god
[47:01] right
[47:02] if that fire appeared today
[47:05] we must see this description on that
[47:08] fire
[47:10] let's see if that fire appeared today
[47:15] and when i saw it
[47:17] i fell upon my face
[47:20] and i heard a voice of one that spoke
[47:23] why did ezekiel fell down
[47:25] because he recognized that's the glory
[47:28] of god that's the presence of god
[47:31] ezekiel fell down and understand that
[47:34] this is the time of worship this is the
[47:39] place where to worship god
[47:43] because the throne of god is dead
[47:47] you worship god where his throne is
[47:51] his throne was in the tabernacle in the
[47:54] wilderness and he was hiding behind the
[47:56] badger skin
[47:58] and his throne was upon the ark of the
[48:00] covenant so when you want to talk to god
[48:03] you go there
[48:04] when you want to worship god you go
[48:06] there
[48:06] then he move all the way to the temple
[48:09] of solomon then from the temple of
[48:11] solomon he moved into the man jesus
[48:14] christ
[48:15] and today we must know where is the fire
[48:23] that will be
[48:25] the place of worship
[48:28] that's where you must meet god
[48:32] ezekiel chapter 16
[48:39] it's time to swallow hard food
[48:49] somebody say it's deep
[48:51] what about i'm saying those deep chop
[48:53] off
[48:54] they make belief
[48:59] ezekiel 16 if you dare you can say amen
[49:04] verse 1
[49:06] again the word of the lord came to me
[49:08] saying
[49:09] son of man thank you brother david
[49:12] cause jerusalem to know her abominations
[49:16] and say that saith the lord god
[49:19] to jerusalem
[49:21] so god is talking to jerusalem we know
[49:24] jerusalem is a city
[49:26] remember that angel da head
[49:30] the van
[49:32] todd
[49:33] john he said come let me show you the
[49:36] the city the new jerusalem which is the
[49:39] bride
[49:40] are you there
[49:41] so when they say city you need to know
[49:43] whether it's a natural city or they are
[49:46] talking about a spiritual city which is
[49:48] a church
[49:49] everybody clear
[49:51] now look at this jerusalem
[49:54] that said the lord god
[49:55] to jerusalem
[49:57] your birth
[49:58] the birth of this jerusalem
[50:01] your birth
[50:02] and your nativity
[50:04] nativity in other words your origin
[50:07] is of the land of canaan
[50:10] remember canaan was the land of heathen
[50:15] israel came destroyed the occupant and
[50:19] took over
[50:20] but originally it was their land of eden
[50:25] okay he's of the land of canaan
[50:28] your father was an amorite
[50:32] he's an amorite a jew
[50:35] so this jerusalem is born from gentile
[50:41] okay
[50:42] your father was an amorite
[50:46] wrong nature
[50:47] and your mother a high that
[50:50] high tattoo jews
[50:52] so this jerusalem
[50:54] is a jerusalem that is birthed from
[50:57] gender
[51:00] we clear now
[51:01] praise the lord
[51:03] and as for your nativity your origin
[51:07] in the day you were born
[51:09] your never was not cut
[51:13] so at the birth of this jerusalem
[51:17] this jerusalem never was taken care of
[51:21] normally
[51:22] normally when a child is born
[51:25] somebody must be there to cut the navel
[51:27] or the belly button if you want to call
[51:29] it are you there
[51:31] but when this jerusalem is born
[51:34] he is neglected
[51:38] you were born
[51:40] your never was not cut
[51:42] neither were you wash in water
[51:46] so jerusalem in a
[51:49] are you there nobody watched this
[51:51] jerusalem
[51:53] to separate you
[51:55] you were not salted at all no character
[52:00] right
[52:02] born in sin
[52:04] shaped in
[52:06] coming into the word speaking
[52:09] a mess
[52:14] no swaddle
[52:16] at all
[52:18] verse 5
[52:19] no i pity you
[52:22] to do any of these to you
[52:26] to have compassion upon you
[52:28] that you were cast out in the open field
[52:34] are you there
[52:35] in matthew chapter 13 when jesus
[52:39] interpret the parable of the field jesus
[52:42] said the field is what
[52:45] how many knows
[52:46] the world do you want to see it are you
[52:48] okay
[52:49] you want to see it
[52:52] we okay
[52:53] okay if you want to see it i can show it
[52:55] to you for those who want to see it it's
[52:57] going to be in matthew chapter 13 verse
[53:00] 36 and 38 you can check that at home are
[53:04] you there so when jesus jerusalem was
[53:07] born
[53:08] this jerusalem was completely abandoned
[53:11] left in a mess
[53:13] a mess
[53:14] and they left it just to grow
[53:17] with the trend of the world
[53:19] cosmos
[53:22] to the nothing of your person
[53:25] in the day that you were born
[53:28] and when i passed by you
[53:31] so
[53:32] at the birth of this jerusalem
[53:35] there was a visitation of god
[53:39] are you there
[53:41] god visit this jerusalem at birth
[53:45] that's the first visit at birth
[53:50] everybody clear when god comes to you
[53:53] first
[53:54] he found you in a mess
[53:59] we clear now
[54:01] okay
[54:02] and when i passed by you
[54:05] and i saw you polluted in a mess
[54:09] drinking smoking
[54:11] all kind of stuff
[54:13] polluted in your own blood
[54:16] we know that blood carry life
[54:19] in other words you will mess in your own
[54:22] life
[54:25] a crook
[54:27] a prostituted
[54:31] right
[54:34] i said to you
[54:36] when you were in your blood live
[54:39] if god spoke life
[54:42] that means
[54:43] this baby was dying
[54:49] everybody clear
[54:51] so death
[54:52] was already said here
[54:54] dead in sin
[54:56] are you there
[54:57] then at the first visitation god brought
[55:01] life
[55:03] the first time god pass he's bringing
[55:07] life
[55:08] praise the lord
[55:11] yea i say to you when you are in your
[55:13] own blood in your own ways of thinking
[55:16] life
[55:18] live
[55:19] life
[55:20] i have caused you to multiply
[55:23] after they gave you life you begin to
[55:25] grow
[55:27] right
[55:28] i have caused you to multiply as the bad
[55:31] of the field
[55:32] and you are increased and watson great
[55:35] and you are come to
[55:37] excellent ornament
[55:40] your breasts are fashioned
[55:43] so god had first came
[55:45] and saw this jerusalem
[55:48] and when they are talking about breasts
[55:50] we understand that this jerusalem is a
[55:53] woman
[55:54] are you there but at first the woman was
[55:57] a child
[55:59] so god brought life
[56:01] and let that woman develop
[56:04] and god was just watching at the
[56:06] progress of the woman
[56:09] when the development of puberty
[56:13] began to come up
[56:16] praise the lord
[56:18] your breasts are fashioned
[56:21] your hair is grown you don't have baby
[56:23] hairs anymore
[56:25] are you there
[56:27] whereas you were
[56:28] naked still not clothed
[56:31] everybody clear
[56:33] and bare no shoe
[56:36] not clothes
[56:41] no
[56:42] shoes because shoes will not speak of
[56:45] the gospel
[56:47] all right
[56:48] the gospel of peace right
[56:50] naked the other leo audition right
[56:53] praise the lord
[56:54] verse 8
[56:56] now when i pass by you
[56:59] this is the second now
[57:01] everybody clear
[57:03] on the first visit
[57:05] naked no shoes death
[57:08] i only came gave you life and left and
[57:12] left you growing
[57:14] but now i'm coming back
[57:17] on the second time
[57:21] not your birth anymore
[57:23] it's a second visit
[57:26] the reason why i'm coming because you
[57:28] are developed
[57:31] you are not a child anymore you are a
[57:33] grown woman
[57:35] now i'm coming
[57:37] at this time
[57:39] verse 8 now when i pass by you
[57:42] and look upon you
[57:44] behold your time was the time of what
[57:49] so there is a time of love young people
[57:52] there is a time to be born
[57:54] there's a time to grow and there is a
[57:57] time to get married
[57:59] i'm not going to preach on that right
[58:02] clear
[58:02] so god first came
[58:05] a birth
[58:06] but the second time he came at the time
[58:10] of love
[58:13] which is the time of marriage
[58:16] right because the bride
[58:19] that jerusalem is now developed
[58:22] she's ready to enter into a
[58:26] union
[58:30] the first time you were dying
[58:32] i brought you grace
[58:36] to give you life
[58:38] but the second time when i'm coming
[58:41] my intent is not for grace anymore
[58:44] my intent is for
[58:50] you gather
[58:51] the two stave
[58:53] off the ark of the covenant

[1:08:42] fulfilling the desire of the flesh
[1:08:45] and of the mind
[1:08:46] and whereby
[1:08:50] amorite
[1:08:51] hi-tat
[1:08:52] okay
[1:08:53] by nature the children of what
[1:08:57] even us
[1:08:59] so by your first birth
[1:09:01] you were born by high-tech
[1:09:04] you were born from an amorite by far by
[1:09:07] your first nature you are not different
[1:09:10] than the people that are going in the
[1:09:13] nightclub
[1:09:17] verse four
[1:09:19] but god
[1:09:22] who is reaching mercy that's why he
[1:09:25] passed by

[1:09:28] god who is reaching mercy for his great
[1:09:31] what
[1:09:32] but you are too young he can't get
[1:09:34] married to a baby
[1:09:36] right
[1:09:37] okay for his great love where if he
[1:09:40] loved us even when we were watching
[1:09:44] so when he was passing by on that field
[1:09:47] he looked at that baby when you are
[1:09:49] still dead
[1:09:50] god loves you

[1:10:12] by grace you are
[1:10:17] and has raised us up together
[1:10:20] and made us sit together in heavenly
[1:10:22] places in christ jesus

[1:10:31] said that in the ages to come he's now
[1:10:34] pushing towards something over there
[1:10:37] right
[1:10:38] in the ages to come he must show the
[1:10:42] exceeding witches of his grace and his

[1:16:50] hidden
[1:16:52] by hand
[1:16:54] that at that time
[1:16:55] you were without who
[1:16:58] being alien from the commonwealth of
[1:17:01] what
[1:17:02] and stranger from the covenant of
[1:17:05] promise having what
[1:17:10] having what
[1:17:11] in the first visit having what
[1:17:15] you were cast in the open field
[1:17:18] no hope

[1:17:52] you who
[1:17:53] sometimes in the past were far off
[1:17:57] are made near by what
[1:18:02] for he is our
[1:18:04] who has made both one
[1:18:07] and has broken down
[1:18:09] the middle wall of partition between
[1:18:12] us
[1:18:13] let's pray
[1:18:15] heavenly father
[1:18:16] lord we thank you again for your grace
[1:18:20] your love your mercy father and for
[1:18:22] everything you're doing for us
[1:18:24] father we did what a man any man can do
[1:18:27] is just take the word of this book and
[1:18:30] read them
[1:18:31] but to come down and give the revelation
[1:18:34] and interpret the word
[1:18:35] it takes the holy spirit
[1:18:38] because you spoke in your word that this
[1:18:40] word is not for a private interpretation
[1:18:43] lord we are moving our self aside
[1:18:47] may you help us move completely out of
[1:18:50] the way may you come and speak your word
[1:18:52] to your children father be the beginning
[1:18:55] and the ending of this service lord we
[1:18:58] commit everything unto the hand rebuking
[1:19:02] all kind of demonic spirit away from
[1:19:04] this place father may heaven be open up
[1:19:08] may forgive all our sins and trespasses
[1:19:11] but may you come down and visit us in
[1:19:14] the name of jesus christ
[1:19:16] amen
[1:19:18] god bless you
[1:19:19] last week we spoke about the mystery
[1:19:22] of the two staves
[1:19:25] we found out that when moses made the
[1:19:28] ark of the testimony
[1:19:30] god told moses
[1:19:32] to make two staves
[1:19:34] so one staff was on the other end
[1:19:37] and another stuff was on the other side
[1:19:40] now we wonder
[1:19:42] who should carry this ark and make the
[1:19:45] ark move
[1:19:47] so when we study last time we understand
[1:19:50] that the ark was moved by men
[1:19:53] and men was the wills that god borrowed
[1:19:57] in order to move his gospel
[1:20:03] or reason why when they came in front of
[1:20:05] jordan
[1:20:06] weaver what they found out was that the
[1:20:10] ark never touched the water
[1:20:12] the ark only engaged in the shoulder of
[1:20:15] the priest
[1:20:16] but now the power of the ark of the
[1:20:19] covenant was communicated into the
[1:20:22] priest
[1:20:23] until god recognized that when the hand
[1:20:26] when the feet
[1:20:28] of the priest touches the water the
[1:20:30] water will completely depart so now man
[1:20:34] and the world became one
[1:20:37] because the word was on the shoulder of
[1:20:39] the man which brother branham
[1:20:41] interpreted to us that the shoulder was
[1:20:44] their heart everybody clear
[1:20:46] now when we look at the first stuff
[1:20:49] of the ark of the covenant we describe
[1:20:52] to you that the ark that stuff was jesus
[1:20:56] christ
[1:20:57] now today we're trying to find out what
[1:21:00] about the second
[1:21:02] stuff everybody clear
[1:21:05] part two
[1:21:08] take zechariah chapter 11 what we wear
[1:21:16] if you dare you can say amen
[1:21:19] verse 7
[1:21:25] praise the lord
[1:21:28] and i will feed everybody there
[1:21:31] and i will feed the flock
[1:21:34] of disorder
[1:21:36] even you are poor of the flock
[1:21:38] and i took to me two staves
[1:21:41] the one i call
[1:21:43] beauty we found out last time he was
[1:21:46] what
[1:21:46] grace because according to isaiah
[1:21:49] because jesus fulfilled the scripture
[1:21:52] and according to isaiah isaiah said
[1:21:54] there was no beauty to him
[1:21:56] and the correct translation was
[1:21:59] grace
[1:22:00] remember
[1:22:01] because the law came by moses that
[1:22:06] came by who
[1:22:08] jesus christ
[1:22:10] and jesus took that grace and gave paul
[1:22:13] a dispersion of what
[1:22:16] we clear now
[1:22:18] now it's clear
[1:22:19] if you miss the old one it's keep
[1:22:22] building up
[1:22:24] are you there
[1:22:25] and the one called beauty or grace
[1:22:29] and the other are called bands or what
[1:22:32] union
[1:22:34] and i fed the flock
[1:22:36] so the first staff
[1:22:39] was grace
[1:22:41] but the second staff
[1:22:43] was
[1:22:44] union there is two of them one is grace
[1:22:46] one is what
[1:22:48] at the first time it is grace
[1:22:51] but on the second time it is
[1:22:58] can i repeat it again
[1:23:00] on the first visit
[1:23:02] it is what
[1:23:04] but on the second visit it's working
[1:23:11] we okay
[1:23:14] praise the lord
[1:23:15] job to verse 10.
[1:23:19] and i took
[1:23:21] my stuff that's god
[1:23:23] even beauty or grace
[1:23:26] and carried a standard in other words
[1:23:27] god broke it and we found last week that
[1:23:30] in isaiah
[1:23:32] jesus was struck by god
[1:23:35] right there
[1:23:36] broken
[1:23:38] that amma break my what
[1:23:41] my covenant which are made with all god
[1:23:44] so god had a covenant with israel
[1:23:48] but by striking the messiah which is
[1:23:51] jesus christ he broke the covenant
[1:23:55] everybody there there is a mystery here
[1:24:01] job to verse 11
[1:24:03] and he was broken in that day
[1:24:06] so the poor of the flock
[1:24:09] that worded upon remember in malachi 3
[1:24:14] behold i will send you uh
[1:24:16] elijah for the people that were doing
[1:24:18] what wedding
[1:24:21] the lord will come
[1:24:23] suddenly in the temple
[1:24:26] where that upon me
[1:24:27] knew that he was the word of god
[1:24:31] so we found out here that when we
[1:24:33] approach grace
[1:24:36] grace was broken
[1:24:39] and we understand that grace was the man
[1:24:42] jesus christ
[1:24:43] because according to this prophecy when
[1:24:46] they evaluated him he was sold for 30
[1:24:49] pieces of silver are you there and then
[1:24:52] he was sold by judah so when jesus
[1:24:55] christ came jesus was the first staff
[1:24:59] which was grace but by breaking christ
[1:25:03] they broke the covenant with the people
[1:25:06] that people was not the gentile
[1:25:10] the people was the jews of israel so
[1:25:14] judah went to the high priest
[1:25:16] took 30 pieces of caesar we saw it last
[1:25:19] week according to jeremiah and according
[1:25:22] to zechariah and then when they did that
[1:25:25] they crucified the messiah
[1:25:30] there is a key there
[1:25:32] where is the key take daniel chapter
[1:25:34] nine
[1:25:39] matter of fact before you go there are
[1:25:41] you still in zechariah
[1:25:43] jump to verse 14.
[1:25:45] so everybody get there
[1:25:48] verse 14 everybody there
[1:25:50] few people everybody there
[1:25:53] if you come to this church you always
[1:25:55] need to bring your bible
[1:26:00] then i'll cut asunder my other
[1:26:04] event
[1:26:06] so band also will be
[1:26:11] okay
[1:26:14] then we'll be broken
[1:26:16] that amount break the
[1:26:19] brotherhood between judah and so when
[1:26:23] the second staff is broken
[1:26:26] he broke
[1:26:27] the brotherhood between judah and
[1:26:31] i hope we will get there now we can go
[1:26:33] to daniel
[1:26:37] two stuff
[1:26:39] two staves actually
[1:26:41] first off broken
[1:26:43] second stuff will be also broken
[1:26:48] daniel chapter nine if you dare you can
[1:26:51] say amen
[1:26:55] okay brother john caught that
[1:26:59] verse 24
[1:27:01] 70 weeks are determined
[1:27:04] you familiar
[1:27:06] i will come to preach on those stuff we
[1:27:08] will
[1:27:09] get them over again
[1:27:12] 70 weeks are determined upon your people
[1:27:16] and upon your holy city to finish the
[1:27:18] transgression and to make an end of sin
[1:27:22] and to make reconciliation for iniquity
[1:27:25] and to bring in everlasting
[1:27:26] righteousness and to seal up the vision
[1:27:29] and prophecy and to anoint the most holy
[1:27:33] six fold purpose
[1:27:35] verse 25
[1:27:37] know therefore and understand
[1:27:39] that from the going forth of the
[1:27:41] commandment
[1:27:42] to restore and to build jerusalem zero
[1:27:46] babel
[1:27:47] to the messiah the prince
[1:27:49] shall be what
[1:27:52] we know that here the scripture is
[1:27:55] talking about 70 weeks
[1:27:59] but when god began to divide those weeks
[1:28:03] the first was seven weeks
[1:28:06] come up
[1:28:11] seven weeks
[1:28:13] and
[1:28:14] three score and two weeks which is 62
[1:28:20] 62 weeks
[1:28:23] three score means 60.
[1:28:26] are you there a score is
[1:28:28] 20 20 20. three score is 60. three score
[1:28:32] and two weeks 62
[1:28:35] the street shall be built again
[1:28:38] and the wall even in troubles time so
[1:28:42] when you take 62 plus 7 it's gonna give
[1:28:45] you 60 now
[1:28:47] there is still
[1:28:48] one week
[1:28:50] that is left
[1:28:52] i'm not gonna if i dig here we're not
[1:28:55] even going to touch here what we are
[1:28:57] trying to talk
[1:28:58] are you there
[1:29:00] and after three score and two weeks
[1:29:02] shall the messiah be what
[1:29:05] everybody clear
[1:29:07] so the messiah will be cut off after
[1:29:11] the
[1:29:12] 62 in other words the messiah will be
[1:29:15] cut off in the one week that is left
[1:29:19] when they say this don't be quick you
[1:29:21] need a prophet
[1:29:25] the messiah will be cut off
[1:29:29] the staff will be
[1:29:34] okay
[1:29:37] but
[1:29:38] not for himself
[1:29:40] and the people of the priests
[1:29:43] that shall come tardis
[1:29:45] shall destroy the city and the sanctuary
[1:29:48] tardis
[1:29:49] and the end thereof shall be with a
[1:29:52] flood
[1:29:53] and to the end of war desolation
[1:29:57] and determine
[1:29:59] are determined verse 27
[1:30:02] and he shall confirm the covenant with
[1:30:06] many for what
[1:30:08] now we found out there is one week there
[1:30:10] so one plus 62 63 63 plus seven gives
[1:30:14] you 70. so it's not a word it's telling
[1:30:18] you the messiah when he comes
[1:30:20] he's going to come here
[1:30:22] this is where the messiah comes
[1:30:24] are you there
[1:30:26] praise the lord
[1:30:28] he shall confirm the covenant with many
[1:30:31] for one week
[1:30:32] and in the what
[1:30:35] you see now
[1:30:37] in there
[1:30:40] everybody clear
[1:30:42] and brother branham told us
[1:30:44] that one week in the bible means how
[1:30:46] many years seven years
[1:30:49] are you there
[1:30:50] and then if it's seven years we have
[1:30:53] three and a half years
[1:30:55] and three and a half years the total
[1:30:58] gives you seven years
[1:31:00] everybody there so in the midst of the
[1:31:03] week
[1:31:04] are you there the messiah i won't be
[1:31:08] everybody clear
[1:31:10] the messiah won't be cut off
[1:31:12] the messiah won't be broken and we know
[1:31:15] that jesus preached for how long
[1:31:18] three and a half years which is the
[1:31:20] ministry of jesus christ
[1:31:26] going clearly
[1:31:28] and in the midst of the week
[1:31:31] he shall cause the sacrifice and the
[1:31:34] oblation to what
[1:31:36] because the temple is gonna be destroyed
[1:31:40] they rejected the messiah they crucified
[1:31:43] jesus christ the temple is going to be
[1:31:45] destroyed the sacrifice will work
[1:31:48] so when we are talking right here when
[1:31:51] they say that
[1:31:53] the first stuff will be broken
[1:31:55] and the breaking of the stuff
[1:31:58] it is talking about the
[1:32:00] 70th week of daniel the last one
[1:32:05] it was locked right in the scripture are
[1:32:07] you there
[1:32:08] so by breaking the messiah israel
[1:32:11] rejected god
[1:32:12] and the gospel leave the jews
[1:32:16] and begin to go to there
[1:32:21] we okay
[1:32:23] brother branham at the end time when the
[1:32:26] tribulation period come
[1:32:28] now here is a little things we are going
[1:32:30] to reverse back a minute
[1:32:32] where the three and what
[1:32:35] half here oh daniel 70
[1:32:39] last word
[1:32:41] of daniel 70 weeks which is
[1:32:45] three and a half
[1:32:48] years
[1:32:49] now
[1:32:50] how many remember that from the church
[1:32:53] ages
[1:32:54] there is 70
[1:32:56] which determined
[1:32:57] did he give you a scripture
[1:33:00] you got to read your bible on your own
[1:33:02] look how perfect he was
[1:33:05] say messiah will come and he will be
[1:33:09] for the sacrifice for his sacrifice in
[1:33:12] the midst of the
[1:33:14] and the obligation well
[1:33:17] then there is still what
[1:33:20] waited
[1:33:23] don't drink to what
[1:33:25] so when we get to this right here
[1:33:30] from here
[1:33:32] all the way to here
[1:33:34] everybody following me god is dealing
[1:33:37] with israel
[1:33:39] right there
[1:33:41] when he come in the midst
[1:33:43] of the last week
[1:33:46] after three and a half year
[1:33:48] god cut off the jews
[1:33:54] everybody follow me
[1:33:56] everybody following me
[1:33:58] so
[1:33:58] the dealing with the jews sees right
[1:34:01] here
[1:34:03] but still
[1:34:04] the jews have
[1:34:06] three and a half years that are left
[1:34:09] which is half of a week
[1:34:12] everybody there
[1:34:13] but in between the first three and a
[1:34:16] half
[1:34:17] when the messiah is crucified on the
[1:34:19] cross
[1:34:20] and god returning back to the jews
[1:34:24] god opened another door
[1:34:26] where he's dealing right here
[1:34:29] in these two midst of the weak he is not
[1:34:32] dealing with jews anymore but god is
[1:34:36] dealing with a jerusalem that is born
[1:34:38] out of
[1:34:43] gentile
[1:34:44] are we okay
[1:34:46] brother branham
[1:34:48] now the 70 weeks was determined
[1:34:50] perfectly
[1:34:51] as daniel said
[1:34:53] that messiah will come and will be cut
[1:34:56] off in what
[1:34:57] the midst of the week and jesus
[1:35:00] prophesied for what
[1:35:02] two and a half years now in the middle
[1:35:05] of this
[1:35:06] three and a half years of daniel in the
[1:35:08] middle of feed he was cut off
[1:35:12] but now the last part of three and a
[1:35:16] half
[1:35:16] is the what
[1:35:19] so in right here
[1:35:21] god will be back to the jews but for the
[1:35:24] gentile it will be a
[1:35:26] tribulation period you don't want to be
[1:35:29] there
[1:35:31] are you there
[1:35:32] you don't want to be there
[1:35:34] where the gentile church is
[1:35:36] oh there
[1:35:38] this is great
[1:35:39] now don't miss this the bride goes in
[1:35:42] with them
[1:35:45] not with a baby
[1:35:47] not the baby goes with the groom
[1:35:52] are you there
[1:35:54] the bride goes with them
[1:35:58] if the blood is going with the groom
[1:36:00] what happened there
[1:36:02] marriage
[1:36:05] are you there
[1:36:06] so brother brother is telling us that
[1:36:08] before god
[1:36:10] goes back to the jewish right here there
[1:36:14] is the rapture of the church
[1:36:18] everybody following me
[1:36:19] because god is taking his bread
[1:36:22] that started in ephesus
[1:36:25] but in laodicea
[1:36:27] god take his bread home
[1:36:32] everybody following me
[1:36:35] praise the lord take luke chapter 21
[1:36:42] when you look at the scripture
[1:36:45] superficially
[1:36:47] you're going to come up with a
[1:36:49] superficial understanding
[1:36:54] luke chapter 21 verse 20.
[1:36:57] if you dare you can say amen
[1:37:01] i still hear some pages turning
[1:37:09] and when you shall see who
[1:37:11] jerusalem compass with army
[1:37:14] that priests that come to destroy the
[1:37:16] city
[1:37:17] then know that the desolation thereof is
[1:37:20] near
[1:37:21] then let them which are in judea flee to
[1:37:24] the mountains
[1:37:25] and let them which are in the midst of
[1:37:27] it they poured out in other words jesus
[1:37:29] already fought foretold them when you
[1:37:31] see the army coming
[1:37:33] depart it's a destruction coming
[1:37:37] which are in the midst of it depart out
[1:37:39] and let none
[1:37:40] not them that are in the country enter
[1:37:43] the ring because they are destroying the
[1:37:45] city they have to destroy the temple to
[1:37:47] make the sacrifice cease
[1:37:50] verse 22 for this be the day of
[1:37:53] vengeance
[1:37:55] that all things
[1:37:57] which are written may be fulfilled
[1:38:00] let me
[1:38:03] drop to verse 24
[1:38:05] and they shall fall by the edge of the
[1:38:07] sword they're gonna kill the jews
[1:38:10] and shall be led the way captive
[1:38:13] unto all nations the jews will be taken
[1:38:15] out
[1:38:16] and jerusalem shall be what
[1:38:19] or trampled down
[1:38:22] chop them down of the
[1:38:25] agenda until
[1:38:27] the time of the gentile be what
[1:38:31] so when they break the first stuff
[1:38:34] the covenant between god and israel is
[1:38:37] broken
[1:38:38] are you there and jesus is saying that
[1:38:41] that covenant will be broken until the
[1:38:44] time of the gentiles
[1:38:47] in other words god is going to leave
[1:38:49] israel and go to the gentiles and
[1:38:51] jerusalem will be in trouble until god
[1:38:54] finished with the
[1:38:56] gentiles god
[1:38:58] from your bible
[1:39:00] everybody clear so far
[1:39:02] check roman chapter 11.
[1:39:10] hallelujah verse 11 verse 7.
[1:39:14] if you dare you can say amen
[1:39:21] everybody there
[1:39:24] if i pass the time you ship your hand we
[1:39:26] stop
[1:39:28] verse 11
[1:39:29] uh verse chapter 11 verse 7
[1:39:32] what then israel has not obtained
[1:39:35] that which he seeks for
[1:39:38] but the election
[1:39:39] has obtained it and the rest were what
[1:39:43] only a small group recognized jesus
[1:39:45] christ
[1:39:46] the remaining of the jews were blinded
[1:39:50] job to
[1:39:51] let's continue
[1:39:53] according as it is written god has given
[1:39:56] them the sleep the spirit of slumber
[1:39:58] eyes that they should not see
[1:40:01] ears that they should not hear
[1:40:03] to this day
[1:40:04] and david said let their table be made
[1:40:07] this name and a trap and a stamping
[1:40:09] block and a word complains to them let
[1:40:12] their eyes be darkened
[1:40:14] that they may not see and bow down their
[1:40:17] back always
[1:40:18] watch verse 11.
[1:40:20] i say then have this stumble that they
[1:40:23] should fall paul is saying that if
[1:40:25] israel stumbled is israel done
[1:40:28] completely he said no no god forbid
[1:40:31] because there is still what three and a
[1:40:33] half years everybody clear
[1:40:36] god forbid but rather through there
[1:40:40] through the
[1:40:42] fall by them rejecting the messiah
[1:40:45] breaking the first half
[1:40:47] are you there
[1:40:49] salvation has come to work
[1:40:52] by rejecting jesus christ salvation
[1:40:56] leaves the jews and goes by
[1:41:00] because jesus started the summer uh the
[1:41:03] the samaritan woman he said salvation is
[1:41:06] of the earth
[1:41:07] but the jews rejected salvation then
[1:41:09] salvation goes to there
[1:41:12] from your bible
[1:41:14] salvation is come to the gentile for to
[1:41:17] provoke them to
[1:41:19] to see if israel will get upset
[1:41:23] like they took my stuff
[1:41:25] are you there
[1:41:26] jump to verse 20
[1:41:30] well
[1:41:31] because of what
[1:41:33] jesus said you would die in your
[1:41:36] because of ambulance they were what
[1:41:41] everybody clear
[1:41:42] and you stand by what
[1:41:45] they just live by
[1:41:48] by faith be not high-minded by what
[1:41:52] because god
[1:41:53] don't play
[1:41:55] let's go down to verse 25 i'm skipping
[1:41:58] this you can read it at home you'll be
[1:41:59] clear for this mystery
[1:42:01] lest you should be wise in your own
[1:42:03] conceit
[1:42:04] that's what
[1:42:06] blindness in
[1:42:08] in part not totally in part
[1:42:14] in part
[1:42:15] is happened to
[1:42:18] until the fullness of the
[1:42:22] be what
[1:42:23] and brother branham said the fullness of
[1:42:25] the gentile is their seven church edges
[1:42:30] if you need a coat you see me
[1:42:33] i have probably three of them
[1:42:35] are you there
[1:42:36] we understand clear now
[1:42:38] right
[1:42:39] so by breaking the first staff
[1:42:42] which is grace
[1:42:43] he took the gospel
[1:42:45] and turned that gospel out from the
[1:42:48] jewish people and send it to the
[1:42:51] jerusalem jerusalem born of
[1:42:54] phenomena and of a high title it is
[1:42:58] jerusalem but jerusalem of the
[1:43:01] gentile
[1:43:05] toward the bride
[1:43:08] take second corinthians 11.
[1:43:18] i have two stops
[1:43:20] if i reach the first one and we good we
[1:43:22] stop there
[1:43:25] we good
[1:43:27] praise the lord
[1:43:32] second corinthians 11
[1:43:34] verse two
[1:43:36] paul who start with the church
[1:43:39] are you there
[1:43:40] a messenger to the gentile
[1:43:43] we already seen that
[1:43:45] verse 2
[1:43:48] for i am what
[1:43:51] paul is jealous
[1:43:53] i am jealous of you with godly
[1:43:57] for i have
[1:43:59] not marry you
[1:44:04] paul
[1:44:05] was not entirely the privilege of
[1:44:08] marriage
[1:44:12] the gospel of paul only is powers you to
[1:44:17] christ
[1:44:21] because power receives a dispersion of
[1:44:25] grace his dispensation is to bring life
[1:44:30] to the woman
[1:44:32] she's still a baby
[1:44:36] even though paul prophesied that jesus
[1:44:39] is coming jesus is coming but he was not
[1:44:42] to come in the time of power
[1:44:47] are you there
[1:44:48] paul work only with the first
[1:44:51] staff
[1:44:54] are you there
[1:44:56] that's why brother branham said the
[1:44:58] anointing of the lion of judah
[1:45:01] was the anointing that was job in
[1:45:04] ephesian churches
[1:45:06] so paul only could bring life
[1:45:10] inspire you
[1:45:12] claim you be jealous but paul cannot
[1:45:16] marry you
[1:45:23] everybody clear
[1:45:25] praise the lord
[1:45:27] not this jerusalem
[1:45:29] the word
[1:45:31] jerusalem the what
[1:45:37] time to finish
[1:45:39] okay let me run this and i'm going to
[1:45:40] hit my stop
[1:45:42] notice jerusalem

[1:52:57] walk up with a meek and humble spirit
[1:53:00] the church that is going to be the bride
[1:53:02] of christ
[1:53:04] now remember esther
[1:53:06] refused the
[1:53:09] adornment
[1:53:10] she took the spirit in her heart to go
[1:53:13] before there
[1:53:15] you must be equipped remember the second
[1:53:18] time when he comes he comes with the
[1:53:21] equipment
[1:53:23] of the bread
[1:53:24] to dress the bride and the bride must be
[1:53:28] ready for herself
[1:53:30] [Music]
[1:53:32] i'm heading to the airport
[1:53:34] are you there
[1:53:37] the bible says
[1:53:39] that the bride have made her
[1:53:44] how can a woman make herself ready for
[1:53:46] the bed wedding
[1:53:50] right
[1:53:51] when a woman gets to get married she's
[1:53:53] sitting
[1:53:55] right and somebody's
[1:53:57] dressing her up turn around she turn
[1:54:00] they do this they do this they do this
[1:54:02] but the bible said the bride
[1:54:05] made herself
[1:54:07] in other words she it looks like she
[1:54:09] doesn't have
[1:54:11] anybody to dress her
[1:54:17] they serve an angel
[1:54:20] with
[1:54:20] the seventh vowel
[1:54:23] was a saint
[1:54:26] remember him
[1:54:27] he was part of the
[1:54:31] brother
[1:54:32] so that angel is a bride also
[1:54:37] [Music]
[1:54:38] are you following me
[1:54:40] are you are you following me
[1:54:42] are you following me
[1:54:43] are you following me the bride needs to
[1:54:46] make herself ready
[1:54:48] doesn't mean the blood is alone
[1:54:52] inside the blood there is one person of
[1:54:55] the blood that dresses the blood since
[1:54:59] the blood is dressed by the messenger
[1:55:02] who is the bride that's why the bride is
[1:55:06] making herself ready
[1:55:13] do you want me to repeat it again
[1:55:15] do you want me to repeat it again
[1:55:17] do you want me to repeat it again
[1:55:19] brother brother means a part of the
[1:55:21] blood
[1:55:23] but brother branham has the commission
[1:55:26] to trust the brother when brother
[1:55:28] branham is trusting the brother
[1:55:31] it is the bride making herself ready
[1:55:42] are you there
[1:55:44] so when god look he see brother branham
[1:55:48] dressing the blood
[1:55:49] god cannot say
[1:55:51] someone is dressing the bread because
[1:55:53] brother branham is part of the bread
[1:55:56] that's why god said the bread is making
[1:55:59] herself ready
[1:56:05] hallelujah the woman today
[1:56:07] the church that thinks she's going to
[1:56:09] get in because she got more members
[1:56:12] she's the best dress crowd she she got
[1:56:15] the biggest organization the biggest
[1:56:17] church in the city and things like that

[1:57:05] jesus blood is not hell
[1:57:09] he will not have his
[1:57:11] dirty
[1:57:12] bread that's why when he comes on a
[1:57:15] second time he takes the woman and begin
[1:57:18] to wash him
[1:57:20] are you there
[1:57:22] if a woman come up to get married and
[1:57:25] she looked like she come out of the pig
[1:57:27] pen out
[1:57:29] a man that's got any dignity about him
[1:57:32] would not marry her
[1:57:33] he make her clean up herself clean
[1:57:36] herself when the church of christ come
[1:57:39] up to get married
[1:57:40] think she's going to be in the blood
[1:57:42] with all the world tagging onto her

[1:57:48] neither is the church of christ of the
[1:57:51] lord jesus christ
[1:57:52] that church is not a ragged church
[1:57:54] either
[1:57:55] we've worn out ragged of denomination
[1:57:58] she don't have to be a member of some
[1:58:01] great denomination she has to be uh
[1:58:07] second visit not saying we belong to the
[1:58:09] biggest church the biggest organization
[1:58:12] this or that she's got to be
[1:58:15] sanctified holy with that spot all
[1:58:19] by the blood of earth
[1:58:22] who
[1:58:24] the second staff have to be
[1:58:29] if the first stuff
[1:58:32] was broken
[1:58:34] and the breaking of the first staff
[1:58:37] was the crucifixion of jesus christ
[1:58:42] i'm heading to the airport i'm gonna
[1:58:44] stop here i'm not gonna touch the
[1:58:45] brotherhood between you then israel
[1:58:47] we're gonna see that later are you there
[1:58:50] if the breaking of the first staff
[1:58:53] means the crucifixion of who
[1:58:57] is union
[1:58:59] which is the ministry of christ
[1:59:03] in the end time
[1:59:05] are you there
[1:59:06] that unites the blood
[1:59:08] with the head
[1:59:10] is broken so there is a second
[1:59:13] crucifixion of jesus christ
[1:59:20] the first one
[1:59:22] we found in exodus 17 that moses struck
[1:59:25] the rock
[1:59:26] job moses only did it one time
[1:59:29] are you there
[1:59:31] but take a number
[1:59:34] i take it to the old testament
[1:59:36] bring it to the new testament and let
[1:59:37] you go
[1:59:39] we good
[1:59:46] okay thank you
[1:59:48] that was it she said man so don't bring
[1:59:51] me trouble
[1:59:57] it comes from the mouth of a babe
[2:00:00] so no trouble there
[2:00:03] if you ask me you took 15 minutes more
[2:00:12] let's go to number chapter 20 verse
[2:00:14] eight if you dare you can say amen
[2:00:18] this is the second time
[2:00:19] the first time moses struck one time
[2:00:22] water came israel drunk everything good
[2:00:24] is will continue a second time
[2:00:28] take the road
[2:00:30] verse 7 and the lord spoke to moses
[2:00:32] saying
[2:00:33] take the road
[2:00:35] and gather you
[2:00:37] the assembly together you and aaron your
[2:00:40] brother and do what
[2:00:42] did god say struck the rock
[2:00:45] the reason why god didn't say struck the
[2:00:48] wrong because the rock was already
[2:00:50] stricken remember that rock was who god
[2:00:54] already struck christ
[2:00:56] are you there
[2:00:58] and he gave a tap that jesus christ will
[2:01:00] be crucified
[2:01:02] that was good
[2:01:04] so when the problem comes again
[2:01:07] god moses come to god god said now since
[2:01:11] the rock is already stricken don't
[2:01:14] struck it again what you need to do is
[2:01:16] now what speak to the rock
[2:01:19] you see that
[2:01:21] speak to the rock before the eyes and it
[2:01:24] shall give forth each water and you
[2:01:26] shall bring forth them out of um them
[2:01:30] water out of the rock so you should give
[2:01:33] the congregation and their beast to
[2:01:35] drink everybody there so far
[2:01:38] and moses took the road
[2:01:40] from before the lord as he commanded him
[2:01:43] and moses
[2:01:45] remember the road was to gather the
[2:01:47] people only
[2:01:49] you see not to struck
[2:01:51] only gather the people because it's
[2:01:53] cheap
[2:01:54] you gather them with the road
[2:01:56] are you there
[2:01:58] gather them with the road but don't
[2:02:00] strike it
[2:02:02] you speak everybody there
[2:02:05] and he took the road from before the
[2:02:06] lord as he commanded that's good
[2:02:09] and moses and aaron gathered the
[2:02:10] congregation together that's good
[2:02:12] before the rock and he said to them
[2:02:15] here now you rebels angry must we
[2:02:20] bring you order out of this rock
[2:02:22] and moses lift up his
[2:02:26] and with his lord watch now
[2:02:29] he did what
[2:02:31] did god tell him to strike the rock
[2:02:34] smart the rock how many times
[2:02:39] crucify the world again
[2:02:43] and water came out abundantly
[2:02:46] and the congregation drunk and the beast
[2:02:49] also
[2:02:51] remember
[2:02:52] even though moses did something wrong
[2:02:56] follow me very carefully
[2:02:58] he never stop the blessing
[2:03:03] are you there
[2:03:04] when the rich young ruler rejected
[2:03:08] christ
[2:03:09] he went on and kept prospering
[2:03:13] are you there
[2:03:15] so don't think if you reject the message
[2:03:19] and you are prospering god is with you
[2:03:24] [Music]
[2:03:33] how many believe moses was a prophet
[2:03:36] he was god love him and when he went
[2:03:39] down there to the rock god said you go
[2:03:41] down there and speak to the rock and it
[2:03:44] shall bring you to order but moses in
[2:03:46] his anger
[2:03:48] he was a high temper he went down there
[2:03:51] instead of speaking to the rock he smote
[2:03:53] the rock and smoothie twice
[2:03:56] they
[2:03:57] broke the whole picture of god
[2:04:00] the rock was
[2:04:02] you believe that don't you minister he
[2:04:04] was only smitten
[2:04:07] and we speak to him
[2:04:09] is that right and moses spoke the right
[2:04:11] of spoke the christ the second time
[2:04:15] but that broke the whole picture of
[2:04:17] god's great program
[2:04:19] bastard into pieces right there christ
[2:04:22] brings meeting twice when he was only
[2:04:24] smitten what
[2:04:26] take your scripture and we finish
[2:04:28] hebrews 6 that was your old testament
[2:04:34] that was your old testament
[2:04:36] let's go to the new testament
[2:04:42] i'm going to stop at this
[2:04:47] hebrew chapter six
[2:04:48] if you dare you can be you can say a man
[2:04:51] everybody there
[2:04:53] verse 4
[2:04:55] for it is what
[2:05:02] for those who are words
[2:05:06] have
[2:05:07] not feel
[2:05:09] nothing has been filled
[2:05:13] god branham said it was not filled
[2:05:15] not filled
[2:05:16] just taste
[2:05:19] you get to a buffet
[2:05:21] is that good let me test it
[2:05:24] you just tested it
[2:05:27] and have tested of the heavenly
[2:05:30] so they have a taste of the holy spirit
[2:05:34] but they were not filled with the holy
[2:05:36] spirit
[2:05:38] tested of the heavenly gift and were
[2:05:41] made protected after
[2:05:44] by testing the holy ghost
[2:05:47] are you there
[2:05:48] the spoken tongue the anointing came
[2:05:50] they did this this they did this this
[2:05:52] they tested it because once you seal it
[2:05:55] is to the day of redemption
[2:05:57] are you there you can't fall back
[2:06:00] but this is impossible if you have
[2:06:02] tested verse 5
[2:06:04] and have tested the what
[2:06:07] they eat the message
[2:06:12] are you there
[2:06:13] and the power of the world to come which
[2:06:17] comes by the message
[2:06:19] if there shall
[2:06:22] if somebody like that come off
[2:06:26] to renew them to
[2:06:28] repentance
[2:06:30] seeing they did what
[2:06:33] to themself there
[2:06:36] in other words they crucified christ the
[2:06:40] second time
[2:06:43] this is in the new testament
[2:06:45] and put him to what
[2:06:48] in other words they are putting christ
[2:06:52] the message
[2:06:53] publicly in the shame
[2:06:57] you following me
[2:06:59] you're following me
[2:07:02] and this
[2:07:04] people
[2:07:05] keep the congregation away from god
[2:07:08] and if there is anything happen
[2:07:11] it spoke of it in the congregation
[2:07:14] they condemn it from there
[2:07:18] from there
[2:07:20] and say it is
[2:07:22] stay away from it
[2:07:24] in doing so
[2:07:27] moses did it
[2:07:29] paul
[2:07:30] warner's
[2:07:31] in doing so
[2:07:33] day
[2:07:33] [Music]
[2:07:35] jesus christ in
[2:07:38] why in 1963
[2:07:42] because the opening of the seven
[2:07:46] the forward was born
[2:07:49] by telling the people get away from that
[2:07:52] they are doing what
[2:07:55] and are just as guilty as those guys
[2:08:02] upon this ground
[2:08:04] upon the ground of what
[2:08:14] so when you take the word away from the
[2:08:17] people you are crucifying what
[2:08:20] [Applause]
[2:08:22] you are breaking union
[2:08:28] is exactly
[2:08:29] what they were doing the very word that
[2:08:32] god was reflecting through his own son
[2:08:35] to prove he was and the one that they
[2:08:38] claimed that they loved
[2:08:39] the jehovah that had manifested himself
[2:08:42] by scripture done exactly what he said
[2:08:45] would do
[2:08:46] exactly what god said he would do and
[2:08:48] reflected before them because the love
[2:08:51] of their church group
[2:08:53] and the things like that they condemn
[2:08:56] the prince of life
[2:08:58] where is he crucified from
[2:09:05] you hypocrite
[2:09:07] you're not better than that i'm not
[2:09:09] angry
[2:09:10] but something inside of me is stirring
[2:09:13] god has been totally
[2:09:15] identified among you where did he get
[2:09:19] his pieces
[2:09:21] in his hand when did he get his pieces
[2:09:24] on
[2:09:25] why does he get today in there
[2:09:29] where did he come from
[2:09:32] among the brother
[2:09:34] where did that come from
[2:09:37] the one who
[2:09:39] claimed to love him
[2:09:40] that is who did it
[2:09:43] that's who does it he is second
[2:09:46] not the first one because union needs to
[2:09:49] be
[2:09:50] his second calvary where he receives his
[2:09:53] piece
[2:09:54] against the word that is what pierces
[2:09:58] him who is he
[2:10:01] he is the word where is he peace the
[2:10:04] hardest from
[2:10:07] just like he wants them are you there
[2:10:11] crucifying the world
[2:10:13] crucifying the message
[2:10:16] you say this was christ
[2:10:18] we are not to come together to talk
[2:10:20] about the message
[2:10:21] we have come together to get in the
[2:10:23] message
[2:10:24] and the message is
[2:10:31] are you there
[2:10:32] the message is right he is though
[2:10:36] that's right
[2:10:37] let me jump here
[2:10:39] how shall he appear in the last day is
[2:10:41] to bring the people back to the earth
[2:10:44] so that the bride the grown woman will
[2:10:47] know her
[2:10:49] no hell
[2:10:51] there
[2:10:52] so by crucifying the message
[2:10:56] it is the second crucifixion of cross
[2:11:01] your second road
[2:11:03] is union
[2:11:04] it takes the message to unite you with
[2:11:07] your groom are you there are you there
[2:11:11] that's why on this pulpit
[2:11:17] are you there
[2:11:18] are you there
[2:11:19] on this same time
[2:11:21] are you there
[2:11:22] they share chariot of the caribbean
[2:11:25] must come down to identify to us where
[2:11:28] is the correct place of worship
[2:11:32] are you there
[2:11:34] are you there
[2:11:36] are you there
[2:11:38] the throne the likeness of the
[2:11:40] appearance above it
[2:11:42] that was who
[2:11:45] who was there
[2:11:46] and the message is who
[2:11:48] the color of what
[2:11:51] around who
[2:11:53] have you seen amber before
[2:11:56] are you there
[2:11:58] are you there
[2:11:59] that you might know that the color of
[2:12:02] the light that is with the lord and the
[2:12:05] lord is light that follows the lord it
[2:12:08] is
[2:12:08] as the lord is amber yellow greenish
[2:12:12] that's what
[2:12:14] of light that is with
[2:12:17] as the scientists took its what
[2:12:21] yellow is green witches
[2:12:24] how many seen ember before
[2:12:27] have you seen ever before
[2:12:29] that's how the ember looks like
[2:12:31] are you there
[2:12:32] but now we have a creature right here
[2:12:35] are you there
[2:12:37] do you know his lunch
[2:12:39] do you know the launch of this creature
[2:12:41] right here
[2:12:42] you cannot see that
[2:12:44] are you there you need to go by the
[2:12:46] angel who hold the golden wheels
[2:12:50] because the measurement
[2:12:52] was the measurement of the engine
[2:12:54] so that creature comes closer to the
[2:12:57] earthly angel
[2:12:59] are you there
[2:13:00] and the earthly engine gives you the
[2:13:03] measurement of the loans
[2:13:06] are you there
[2:13:07] are you there
[2:13:11] let me give you differently are you
[2:13:13] there
[2:13:14] are you there
[2:13:15] are you there if he appear you don't
[2:13:18] know where his launch is
[2:13:20] but when he appears he must appear close
[2:13:23] to the seven engine so you take the
[2:13:25] measurement of the noise from the seven
[2:13:29] engine are you there from the seven
[2:13:31] engine up and from the seven engine down
[2:13:36] are you there then when you look at this
[2:13:38] creature right here it look exactly like
[2:13:41] amber
[2:13:42] are you there telling you that the
[2:13:45] caribbeans came down
[2:13:47] vindicating that this is the message
[2:13:51] this is the place of worship this is the
[2:13:54] stuff you need for your union
[2:14:00] are you there
[2:14:01] are you there
[2:14:02] you need the measurement of the angel to
[2:14:05] measure him he look like fire
[2:14:10] brother random help me god still exists
[2:14:14] in the same colors
[2:14:16] from the launch approach
[2:14:18] fire amber color
[2:14:20] shut with her
[2:14:22] oh with her
[2:14:24] and
[2:14:31] many colors like that
[2:14:33] ezekiel one
[2:14:35] in the sky after
[2:14:38] jesus christ the same
[2:14:41] [Applause]
[2:14:42] the holy spirit still in
[2:14:45] still in his church in the last
[2:14:48] not me
[2:14:50] i was just standing there
[2:15:03] but one came and stood beside him so you
[2:15:07] get the measurement right
[2:15:11] i want you to look at that
[2:15:13] just exactly what
[2:15:26] [Music]
[2:15:33] are you there
[2:15:35] and it happened
[2:15:37] when brother problem is doing what
[2:15:42] under what
[2:15:46] the bible and standing here with this
[2:15:49] bible on the sacred desk there
[2:15:52] the word
[2:15:54] [Music]
[2:15:59] it happened when brother branham is
[2:16:02] preaching the message he preaches the
[2:16:05] message
[2:16:06] and he was so inclined with god until
[2:16:09] god took the chariot took the thought
[2:16:12] caribbean and dropped down
[2:16:14] and shut the picture to show you that
[2:16:17] this is the place of worship
[2:16:23] are you there
[2:16:25] i am thankful to god
[2:16:27] to be living the invisible what
[2:16:33] the second stuff is called what
[2:16:36] the invisible what
[2:16:38] of what
[2:16:40] i'm thankful to god to be living in this
[2:16:43] time
[2:16:44] as the closing of the scene of the world
[2:16:46] history
[2:16:48] if i would have
[2:16:50] say
[2:16:51] he would have said so before the
[2:16:52] foundation of the world if he would have
[2:16:54] laid out the whole program to me and say
[2:16:57] i want you to preach it now what age do
[2:16:59] you desire to go to the earth to preach
[2:17:01] i would have chosen
[2:17:04] for i think it is though
[2:17:06] i certainly would have loved to be
[2:17:10] during the first time of his visit
[2:17:13] when he came as a man but still i think
[2:17:16] this right now is what
[2:17:20] greater than what
[2:17:22] than the first coming
[2:17:24] because it is the time that he is coming
[2:17:26] to take them
[2:17:28] that he is
[2:17:30] nearing the resurrection when all the
[2:17:32] redeemer will come
[2:17:34] what a glorious opportunity we have to
[2:17:37] speak to her
[2:17:39] great what
[2:17:42] first part two steve
[2:17:44] that's your stop
[2:17:46] the first was crushed
[2:17:48] this second part we found that it's
[2:17:50] crust now
[2:17:51] are you there
[2:17:53] the alpha and the omega is there the
[2:17:56] first ministry and the last ministry is
[2:17:58] there
[2:17:59] the first message and the
[2:18:02] last message is there
[2:18:04] i am alpha i am
[2:18:07] union and grace are you there
[2:18:11] the same holy ghost
[2:18:13] spirit is the same
[2:18:16] move
[2:18:17] in the same move that he moved in there
[2:18:22] in the
[2:18:23] first visit
[2:18:25] when you were a baby under eastern
[2:18:28] people with paul has come header
[2:18:32] under western you adult now bringing the
[2:18:37] same
[2:18:38] that is to say though
[2:18:40] and the fullness of the power of the
[2:18:42] resurrection of jesus christ we are
[2:18:45] living at the setting of the sun and the
[2:18:47] gospel light as he was criticized and
[2:18:50] made fun as the broke broke broke broke
[2:18:54] grace they wanna make fun of the message
[2:18:58] beginning of his first shining forth
[2:19:00] under his people he will receive the
[2:19:02] same type of work
[2:19:04] as he was under
[2:19:07] but at the same jesus
[2:19:09] god blesses the people in there
[2:19:12] by his
[2:19:14] that's why he have to come down
[2:19:16] personally
[2:19:18] he's blessing them in the form of the
[2:19:20] holy ghost under
[2:19:22] other sheep that i have
[2:19:24] not on this fold the gentile are you
[2:19:27] there
[2:19:28] your second step is the
[2:19:30] message
[2:19:32] lion virgo lion
[2:19:35] the two pyramid of david
[2:19:38] we will go but
[2:19:40] when he broke down here
[2:19:42] when this stave is broken
[2:19:44] he divided israel
[2:19:46] what does it mean
[2:19:48] we get on the next time
[2:19:50] next time
[2:19:52] [Applause]
[2:20:00] church
[2:20:01] there is nothing new
[2:20:04] there is nothing new
[2:20:07] whatever is happening
[2:20:09] let it never shake you
[2:20:12] because it's prophecy being so fair
[2:20:17] instead of being shaken
[2:20:20] let it be a
[2:20:22] stabilizing forces for you that i am
[2:20:25] following something that is right
[2:20:28] remember if somebody worshiped brother
[2:20:30] branham a word to him
[2:20:32] but to me it's a confirmation
[2:20:34] if somebody crucified the message
[2:20:37] want to him to me it is uh
[2:20:40] because the message in the old testament
[2:20:43] was crucified in the new testament paul
[2:20:46] spoke about the crucifixion it must
[2:20:49] happen
[2:20:50] are you there but thank god
[2:20:53] among the gentiles
[2:20:55] in this last day
[2:20:56] god came
[2:20:58] to clean us up
[2:21:00] because the ministry of zoroba there
[2:21:02] brings both stone
[2:21:05] he brings the cornerstone
[2:21:07] restore back what paul head and bring us
[2:21:11] up the union of revelation 10.
[2:21:14] so in this end time by the message of
[2:21:17] malachi 4 we are cleansed from our
[2:21:20] tradition we are cleansed from our
[2:21:22] country we are claimed for our life we
[2:21:26] are clean for our former life but not
[2:21:28] only are we clean we are also judged for
[2:21:31] the marriage we are also united with the
[2:21:33] brethren because the place of god
[2:21:36] worship where the caribbeans
[2:21:39] took a picture to tell you i am here
[2:21:42] i vindicate this message that it is true
[2:21:47] [Applause]
[2:21:49] let's pray
