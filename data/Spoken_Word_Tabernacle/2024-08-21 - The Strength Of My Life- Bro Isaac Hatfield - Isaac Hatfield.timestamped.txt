[38:52] tell you all you have to do he said
[38:54] there's nothing about whatever you had
[38:56] going on he said it's about you so when
[38:59] we sat there and prayed and it was a
[39:00] song and I'm going sing it for y'all one
[39:02] day I got to get it right and it's and
[39:04] it's a song um um by Toren Wells and
[39:07] it's called trenches and that song's may
[39:09] be about um six years old but he was
[39:12] saying in one part of that song he said
[39:14] I was going through a battle because he
[39:16] said I was trying to be my own Savior
[39:19] and once you try to put yourself in
[39:21] front of God God will tap you in the
[39:22] soldier and say come on back that's
[39:24] right and he took and I and I'm and and

[59:20] Lord is the strength of my life of whom
[59:22] shall I be afraid when the wicked even

[59:51] of the Lord and to inquire in his Temple
[59:54] for in the time of trouble he shall hide
[59:56] me in his Pavilion in the secret of his
[59:59] Tabernacle shall he hide me he shall set
[1:00:02] me up upon a rock and now shall my head
[1:00:05] be lifted up above mine enemies round

[1:01:02] courage and he shall strengthen thine
[1:01:04] heart wait I say on the Lord am
[1:01:09] amen we we could bow our heads for a
[1:01:11] word of
[1:01:13] prayer Heavenly Father we're so thankful
[1:01:16] for the opportunity of being in your
[1:01:18] presence once more Lord and filling the
[1:01:21] atmosphere as it's been built father
[1:01:23] Lord not just by a lord a work up but
[1:01:26] father it's the presence of the Living
[1:01:28] God and Lord we hear how your hand has
[1:01:31] reached down and brought one of your
[1:01:33] children home and father we Rejoice Lord
[1:01:36] that Lord and and father maybe there's
[1:01:38] still mothers sitting in here tonight
[1:01:40] they've got children Lord we know that
[1:01:42] you're the same yesterday today and
[1:01:44] forever father what you could do for
[1:01:46] brother Kelly Lord you could do father
[1:01:48] for another one father I I pray Lord
[1:01:51] that you just come down in a special way
[1:01:53] tonight Lord I I know I've got no ility
[1:01:56] of my own but father Lord we commit
[1:01:59] ourselves to you Lord and we ask that
[1:02:00] you have the right away in this meeting
[1:02:03] father Lord close our lips from speaking
[1:02:05] something contrary to your will and open
[1:02:08] them to speak what you would have for
[1:02:09] your children tonight dear Lord we'll
[1:02:12] give you all the glory and the honors we
[1:02:14] commit this service into your hands in
[1:02:16] Jesus name amen and amen you may have
[1:02:19] your seats tonight and if we want to
[1:02:22] have a title tonight we'll take it out
[1:02:24] of that first verse and we'd like to
[1:02:25] speak on the strength of my life amen
[1:02:29] the the the strength of my life and and
[1:02:32] when we're speaking of strength we
[1:02:34] realize that there's different types of
[1:02:36] strength you know there's strength in
[1:02:37] the natural that that would allow you to
[1:02:40] to lift something heavy or or to do
[1:02:42] great uh uh physical Feats that there's
[1:02:44] a natural strength that that lays in the
[1:02:47] muscle of a man or a woman uh and we
[1:02:50] think of a a religious strength where
[1:02:53] somebody would would depend upon a
[1:02:55] church for the strength right or or
[1:02:57] depend upon a just a Creed or or Dogma
[1:03:01] or or say I burn a candle every night
[1:03:03] and that's the strength of Christianity
[1:03:05] socalled but but we realize that we're
[1:03:08] speaking of a different type of strength
[1:03:10] when when we're speaking of here what
[1:03:12] David was talking about when he said the
[1:03:14] Lord is the strength of my life that's
[1:03:17] the strength that we're speaking about
[1:03:18] tonight it's the strength of a true son
[1:03:21] or daughter of God and it comes from the
[1:03:24] Lord and so when we look at this
[1:03:26] scripture it says the Lord is the
[1:03:28] strength of my life of whom shall I be
[1:03:30] afraid and if you look at the definition
[1:03:32] of strength it's the quality or state of
[1:03:35] being physically strong which isn't so
[1:03:37] much what we're speaking about tonight
[1:03:39] but another definition is the capacity
[1:03:42] of an object or substance to withstand
[1:03:45] great force or pressure and and if we
[1:03:48] look at the strong concordance for the
[1:03:50] word strength here it's it's speaking of
[1:03:52] a fortified place or a defense a
[1:03:55] Fortress or or stronghold and even
[1:03:58] Jeremiah wrote that oh oh Lord my
[1:04:02] strength and my Fortress my refuge in
[1:04:04] the day of Affliction we know that the
[1:04:07] name of the Lord is a strong tower and
[1:04:10] so when David writes the Lord is the
[1:04:12] strength of my life of whom shall I be
[1:04:14] afraid we realize that we have a
[1:04:17] fortress in this dark hour that we
[1:04:19] liveing we realize that the the the
[1:04:21] enemy has come in like a flood we
[1:04:23] realize that we Face the enemy every day
[1:04:25] day but when you realize where your
[1:04:28] strength comes from you realize you're
[1:04:30] hid away in the time of trouble like we
[1:04:33] read in the Book of Psalms 27 it said
[1:04:36] when the wicked even my enemies and my
[1:04:38] foes when they come against me he said
[1:04:40] when they come upon me to eat up my
[1:04:42] flesh they stumbled and fell though and
[1:04:44] host should be camped round about me I
[1:04:46] will not fear and Whom Shall I Fear when
[1:04:49] the Lord is the strength of my life when
[1:04:51] the Lord is my Fortress when the Lord is
[1:04:54] my stronghold
[1:04:56] Whom Shall I Fear for we've not been
[1:04:58] given the spirit of fear right but of
[1:05:01] power and of love and of a sound mind
[1:05:04] and every man that's been born into this
[1:05:06] kingdom of God has not one thing to fear
[1:05:09] how many times when you turn on the
[1:05:11] message you hear brother Brandon trying
[1:05:13] to get the fear out of the people if you
[1:05:15] only knew who you were if you only knew
[1:05:17] where you stood and when you realize
[1:05:19] that you're standing in a fortress that
[1:05:22] is the strength of almighty God you can
[1:05:25] look at the enemies all around you and
[1:05:27] say I shall not fear you for my strength
[1:05:30] comes from the Lord amen we even have a
[1:05:33] promise this has been one of my favorite
[1:05:35] scriptures in Proverbs 3 it says when
[1:05:37] thou liest down Thou shalt not be afraid
[1:05:41] Thou shalt lie down and thy sleep shall
[1:05:43] be sweet amen here's a promise be not
[1:05:46] afraid of sudden fear neither of the
[1:05:49] desolation of the wicked when it cometh
[1:05:51] for the Lord shall be thy confidence and
[1:05:54] shall keep thy foot from being taken
[1:05:57] sometimes sometimes you you don't even
[1:05:59] have anything to be afraid of but you're
[1:06:01] you're waiting for something to be
[1:06:03] afraid of you're you're afraid of a
[1:06:05] sudden fear you're afraid that what
[1:06:08] what's going to be on the news when you
[1:06:09] wake up but we have a promise that you
[1:06:12] can lay your head on the pillow and go
[1:06:14] to sleep and rest and have peace in the
[1:06:17] midst of trials and tribulations because
[1:06:21] Whom Shall I Fear when the Lord is the
[1:06:24] strength of my life can you say Amen am
[1:06:27] amen but but we didn't always have this
[1:06:29] strength we were once without strength
[1:06:31] that's what the Bible says in Romans 5
[1:06:34] for when we were yet without Strength In
[1:06:37] Due Time Christ died for the
[1:06:39] ungodly man is it okay if I read a
[1:06:41] little bit tonight amen for when we were
[1:06:44] yet without strength we we were weak we
[1:06:47] were a feeble people we were
[1:06:49] strengthless we were in a condition of
[1:06:51] weakness is that right but in that time
[1:06:53] God sent his only son
[1:06:56] that he might die for our sins and send
[1:06:59] back a strength upon the church is that
[1:07:01] right so there he went up to calary and
[1:07:04] there the blood dripped down his leg as
[1:07:06] it batted against that skin of that that
[1:07:09] animal as that cross was carried up to
[1:07:11] Gethsemane the strength was leaving his
[1:07:14] body and he was getting weaker and
[1:07:16] weaker but what was happening he was
[1:07:18] beginning to come to a place where he
[1:07:20] could transfer strength back onto the
[1:07:23] people of God and send back his Spirit
[1:07:26] upon the day of Pentecost to strengthen
[1:07:28] the church for the contest that laid
[1:07:31] ahead for you see we're in a contest
[1:07:33] friends we're in a battle every day and
[1:07:36] and brother Brandon preached the message
[1:07:37] of contest he said it's a test of
[1:07:40] strength and mean like those Indians
[1:07:42] that would take a rope and they would
[1:07:44] build a fire in the middle and they
[1:07:46] would play tug of war to see who could
[1:07:48] pull the other side Into the Fire he
[1:07:51] said the greatest contest is between
[1:07:53] Church uh the church and Satan is that
[1:07:56] right and there there Satan uh when this
[1:08:00] battle started in heaven Satan was
[1:08:02] kicked out and now he's trying to do
[1:08:04] everything he can to pull the Church of
[1:08:06] the Living God into the fires that he's
[1:08:09] built that's right is that right we we
[1:08:12] face it every day but God has given us a
[1:08:15] word that would become our strength amen
[1:08:18] is that right so that we would have
[1:08:20] something to fight back with so that we
[1:08:23] could take the rope and pull the enemies
[1:08:26] in into his own fire which he's built
[1:08:29] amen that what the enemy meant for you
[1:08:30] would turn around and you could pull the
[1:08:33] enemy into the fire not by your own
[1:08:35] strength but by the strength of the word
[1:08:37] of God and God gave us the greatest
[1:08:40] thing he could gave us was the word for
[1:08:42] that's how he overcame he overcame by
[1:08:45] the blood of the Lamb by the word of the
[1:08:47] testimony uh when he said it is written
[1:08:50] that's how he overcame and so that's how
[1:08:52] we're going to overcome he's G he we've
[1:08:54] been forward ified in the word of God uh
[1:08:58] the Lord is my strength the Lord is my
[1:09:01] Fortress and it's the strength of God's
[1:09:04] word in you Amen brother and sister you
[1:09:07] see it's not just a letter for the
[1:09:09] letter kth but it's the strength of the
[1:09:12] word of God when it comes into your
[1:09:15] heart and me God sent back a strength
[1:09:17] upon the church that could keep you in
[1:09:19] the time of trouble amen and even so
[1:09:23] much that Peter had he he had been saved
[1:09:26] he'd walk with the Lord but he still had
[1:09:28] to go up to Pentecost so that he could
[1:09:30] be converted and then he could
[1:09:32] strengthen his Brethren amen he didn't
[1:09:35] have it in him at the time but when he
[1:09:37] got the Holy Spirit there was something
[1:09:39] in him to strengthen his Brethren yes my
[1:09:41] brother oh and it's a strength that you
[1:09:43] can give out to others amen amen uh
[1:09:47] sometimes you draw strength from your
[1:09:49] pastor sometimes you just draw strength
[1:09:51] from your brother and your sister but
[1:09:54] but but also
[1:09:55] and that's that's wonderful amen God God
[1:09:59] God's given us a a people that we can do
[1:10:01] that but but you must come to a place in
[1:10:03] your life where you have a strength in
[1:10:06] your own life that's right amen where
[1:10:08] you know him as a personal God Amen and
[1:10:11] that's where David come to when he would
[1:10:13] write in in the Book of Psalms 19 he
[1:10:16] would say oh Lord my strength and my
[1:10:18] redeemer Psalms 28 the Lord is my
[1:10:21] strength and my shield yes sir uh skip
[1:10:24] down the Lord Lord is their strength he
[1:10:26] is the saving strength of his anointed
[1:10:29] Psalms 46 God is our refuge and strength
[1:10:32] a very present help and trouble Psalms
[1:10:34] 81 sing aloud unto God our strength
[1:10:38] Psalms 118 the Lord is my strength and
[1:10:41] song Psalms 144 blessed be the Lord my
[1:10:45] strength amen we realize where our
[1:10:48] strength comes from tonight our strength
[1:10:50] doesn't come from the building our
[1:10:52] strength doesn't come from the chairs
[1:10:54] our strength doesn't come from the music
[1:10:57] our strength comes from one
[1:10:59] place the Lord Our Savior and our God
[1:11:02] our strength comes from Elohim our
[1:11:05] strength comes from the one who created
[1:11:07] the heavens and the earth oh for in the
[1:11:10] beginning was the word and the Word was
[1:11:13] with God and the Word was God and the
[1:11:16] Bible always also says that God is a
[1:11:19] spirit yes sir yes amen so when God gave
[1:11:22] us the word as our strength that's right
[1:11:25] but the Holy Ghost is the spirit of the
[1:11:27] word amen so it's not enough just to
[1:11:29] have the letter but but the word it it
[1:11:33] that is God that is the strength of Our
[1:11:36] Lives not just the letter but the word
[1:11:39] the spirit of the word the holy ghost
[1:11:42] that comes in your life yes oh and it
[1:11:44] makes you live out every word amen amen
[1:11:48] amen we were just at the hospital for a
[1:11:50] test there for for Bethany and when we
[1:11:52] were there there was an elderly uh lady
[1:11:55] there there that that was getting a test
[1:11:56] and and and she was full of life she was
[1:12:00] she was full of enthusiasm and she began
[1:12:02] to talk to us and and she said people
[1:12:04] ask me how I do it and she would begin
[1:12:07] to say she tell us that it was the Holy
[1:12:09] Spirit that that that was the reason she
[1:12:11] did it and and and and how you must have
[1:12:14] the Holy Spirit and I thought that's
[1:12:16] nice you know and and and and I believe
[1:12:18] maybe she had a you know a portion of
[1:12:21] that that would give her strength but
[1:12:23] but she had cut hair and ears and and so
[1:12:26] we realize that she was lacking
[1:12:27] something although she may have drawn
[1:12:29] strength from from the church or drawn
[1:12:32] strength from from those things to an
[1:12:34] element there was a greater strength
[1:12:37] that must come in the life amen that
[1:12:39] will line your life up with every word
[1:12:42] that's right
[1:12:43] amen and but God has promised us that
[1:12:46] strength yes Amen in the book of Isaiah
[1:12:49] 28 it talks about the coming of the Holy
[1:12:52] Spirit the great witness it talked about
[1:12:55] how with stammering lips and other
[1:12:57] tongues will he speak to this people and
[1:12:59] he said this is the rest wherewith ye
[1:13:02] may cause the weary to rest and this is
[1:13:04] the refreshing amen but just a few
[1:13:07] verses back in verse 5 through six it
[1:13:10] says in that day shall the Lord of hosts
[1:13:13] be for a Crown of Glory and for a diadem
[1:13:16] of beauty onto the residue of his people
[1:13:19] that's right and for a spirit of
[1:13:21] judgment to him that sth in judgment and
[1:13:24] for strength to them that turn the
[1:13:27] battle to the gate amen Amen brother
[1:13:29] brandham speaks of this verse and he
[1:13:32] says what is he speaking of a great day
[1:13:34] when the witness would come what is our
[1:13:36] Crown the Holy Spirit crowns us the
[1:13:39] residue is the people that's left over
[1:13:42] he'll be a diadem a Crown of Glory a
[1:13:45] diadem of beauty and he says thank this
[1:13:47] is 700 years before it happened and and
[1:13:51] and then he says uh for strength to them
[1:13:54] that turn the back battle to the gate
[1:13:56] and he said them who is standing for him
[1:13:59] and with him this great spirit will be
[1:14:02] the strength of him that stands at the
[1:14:04] gate Amen in the battle he is our
[1:14:07] strength yes sir we rely upon him that's
[1:14:10] right not upon culture not upon
[1:14:12] education not upon things of the world
[1:14:15] not by power not by might but by my
[1:14:18] spirit sayth the Lord and he says the
[1:14:21] church rest solemnly in that he will be
[1:14:24] the strength of them that stands in the
[1:14:25] gate not his theological background not
[1:14:28] his denomination but the Holy Ghost will
[1:14:30] be his strength he will be the one that
[1:14:33] will stand at the gate he'll rely upon
[1:14:35] the strength of the Holy Spirit to turn
[1:14:37] the Ellen away amen amen we realize
[1:14:40] where our strength comes from because
[1:14:43] we're in a battle and I like how he says
[1:14:45] it there that he'll rely upon the
[1:14:47] strength of the Holy Spirit to turn the
[1:14:49] ellien away for in Hebrews 11 the faith
[1:14:53] chapter when it's talking about the hero
[1:14:55] of the faith it says how they quenched
[1:14:57] the violence of fire escaped the edge of
[1:15:00] the sword out of weakness were made
[1:15:02] strong wax Valley and fight and turn to
[1:15:05] flight the armies of the aliens uh that
[1:15:09] that would be the Philistines that that
[1:15:11] would be the Giants in the land the ones
[1:15:14] that these Heroes of Faith came in
[1:15:15] contact with these aliens they turned
[1:15:18] them away by the strength of God and it
[1:15:21] was out of weakness that they were made
[1:15:23] strong yes my brother man for for God
[1:15:26] doesn't need our strength but like Paul
[1:15:28] wrote that that perfect strength is made
[1:15:31] perfect in our weakness that's right and
[1:15:33] how he would write that that my grace is
[1:15:36] sufficient for thee for my strength is
[1:15:38] made perfect in weakness and the more
[1:15:40] weaker we can become brother and sister
[1:15:43] the more his strength can come into our
[1:15:45] lives amen just the more you can pour
[1:15:48] out of yourself the more you can die out
[1:15:51] of your habits and and your abilities
[1:15:54] and and ideas that's the more God can
[1:15:57] make known his strength in your life
[1:15:59] amen amen
[1:16:01] amen and like Elijah in in the day when
[1:16:05] he stood Against The Jezebel religions
[1:16:07] and against the systems of that day you
[1:16:10] know I'm sure he felt a feeling of
[1:16:12] rejection I'm sure there was times when
[1:16:14] he felt a feeling of loneliness but the
[1:16:17] thing is about the strength of the lord
[1:16:19] it's all that we need amen and that was
[1:16:22] all that Elijah needed in that day yes
[1:16:25] and and when brother Brandon was on the
[1:16:27] scene you know he would walk into the
[1:16:28] great big coliseums of Oral Roberts and
[1:16:31] Billy grahams and think my their their
[1:16:33] Ministry spun off of mine and here they
[1:16:36] are and does the Lord think less of me
[1:16:38] but the Lord begin to come down and
[1:16:40] speak to that I am your portion look up
[1:16:43] to look up and and see where your
[1:16:45] portion lays see where your strength
[1:16:48] comes from and I'll be the strength of
[1:16:50] your life and then your strength may not
[1:16:52] lie in in in nice homes and nice cars on
[1:16:56] this side your strength may not come
[1:16:58] from those things but but we have a
[1:17:01] strength yes my and because we've been
[1:17:04] made weak God can put a strength in our
[1:17:07] lives that would carry us through amen
[1:17:10] amen is that okay just to lay a
[1:17:11] foundation a little bit take your time
[1:17:14] the Lord your is the strength of my life
[1:17:17] amen and when we think about that we
[1:17:19] think about
[1:17:20] Samson Samson was one of the first ones
[1:17:22] brother brandom ever spoke on that was
[1:17:25] his first sermon was about Samson
[1:17:27] because brother brandom likes strength
[1:17:30] he said I couldn't I just can't imagine
[1:17:32] Samson being a great big strong man with
[1:17:35] big muscles brother B said I can't
[1:17:37] imagine him being that way for then the
[1:17:39] glory might come upon a man but the
[1:17:42] thing about Samson was he was he was
[1:17:44] weak he he he was a little man maybe a
[1:17:47] small framed man and maybe didn't maybe
[1:17:50] wasn't built in the great physical
[1:17:53] stature but but the thing about it was
[1:17:55] the anointing of the Lord would come
[1:17:57] upon him and the Lord would get the
[1:17:59] glory when God would move upon Samson
[1:18:03] and we look at the events of his life
[1:18:05] when a lion would come in the scripture
[1:18:07] would say the spirit of the Lord came
[1:18:10] mightily upon him right when he slew 30
[1:18:13] men it was the spirit of the Lord came
[1:18:15] mightily upon him when he took a Jawbone
[1:18:17] and fought a thousand uh uh Philistines
[1:18:21] it was the spirit of the Lord moved upon
[1:18:23] them what what was was it about Samson
[1:18:25] it was a hidden power amen it was the
[1:18:28] hidden power that Samson had let come
[1:18:31] into his life and brother Brandon would
[1:18:34] say it's not like a uh taking a rabbit's
[1:18:36] foot and rubbing it it's not like a
[1:18:38] lucky horseshoe he said it's not
[1:18:41] something that we make up this hidden
[1:18:43] power isn't something that's just a
[1:18:45] lucky charm this hidden power comes
[1:18:48] through a birth where God puts his
[1:18:50] spirit inside of you and it's no longer
[1:18:52] you live but it's Christ that lives
[1:18:54] through you amen I'm talking about a
[1:18:57] hidden power am I'm not not something
[1:18:59] that you manufacture not something that
[1:19:01] you have to put on uh overcoming isn't
[1:19:04] some something that you have to just
[1:19:06] work up and force it's a hidden power
[1:19:09] that comes into your life oh and it
[1:19:11] makes the Christian experience a joyful
[1:19:14] thing it makes this battle that we're in
[1:19:16] a glorious fight because it's not
[1:19:19] resting upon our ability it's not going
[1:19:22] to be by might it's not going to be by
[1:19:24] power
[1:19:25] but it'll be by the spirit of the Lord
[1:19:27] as it moves upon us and begins to bring
[1:19:30] an overcoming where where where you
[1:19:32] would be about to say something wrong
[1:19:35] and something would come over you and
[1:19:37] say oh maybe you shouldn't say that and
[1:19:39] man you didn't teach yourself to do that
[1:19:41] it's something that come on the inside
[1:19:43] of you and begin to live out of you and
[1:19:46] manifest the word of God it's a it's a
[1:19:49] hidden power it's an anointing that
[1:19:52] rests upon your life uh that you could
[1:19:55] never do it that's it but it's God
[1:19:57] himself brother the Holy Spirit has come
[1:20:01] the person of Jesus Christ has indwelled
[1:20:04] himself inside of you that's the power
[1:20:07] that we're talking about that's the
[1:20:09] strength that we're talking about yes
[1:20:11] sir amen but the problem was Delilah
[1:20:13] came in and begin to deal with Samson
[1:20:15] after he had had the great experience of
[1:20:17] carrying the gates of the city and here
[1:20:20] come a Delilah and brother Brandon
[1:20:21] warned us that there's three things that
[1:20:23] a person should watch
[1:20:25] especially in the ministry and things
[1:20:26] it's woman money and popularity and
[1:20:29] brother BR said Samson fell from woman I
[1:20:32] believe was balum fell from money and
[1:20:34] Saul fell from popularity and so here
[1:20:37] comes Delilah in and she begins to begin
[1:20:40] to ask Satan or uh forgive me Samson
[1:20:43] where does thy great strength
[1:20:46] lie and Samson would say oh you know if
[1:20:49] they bind me with seven great wids and
[1:20:52] she would do it and say the pH
[1:20:54] Philistines be upon the Samson and and
[1:20:57] he would be able to break out of it and
[1:20:59] he be to do this three different times
[1:21:02] and say if they fast me with new ropes
[1:21:04] and if they weave the Seven Locks in my
[1:21:06] head with a web and I think it's amazing
[1:21:10] that DEA came to Samson four different
[1:21:12] times and and brother Brandon picks it
[1:21:15] up and and talks it and ties it into the
[1:21:17] the church how they they they tried to
[1:21:20] bind the Catholic church but he rose up
[1:21:22] on Martin Luther and broke the cord they
[1:21:26] tried to bind the Lutheran Church and he
[1:21:27] raised up a John Wesley and broke the
[1:21:29] cord and then they tried to bind it
[1:21:32] again but he rose up a Pentecostal
[1:21:34] church and broke the cord and he said
[1:21:36] now Pentecost is being bound by the same
[1:21:39] thing and it reminds me of those four
[1:21:42] bugs that would come in and try to eat
[1:21:44] away at the tree and they would try to
[1:21:46] eat through the fruit and through the
[1:21:48] leaves and through the bark but what
[1:21:50] they were really after was to get to the
[1:21:52] heart of the tree the LIF line where the
[1:21:55] sapl playay and here Delila come and she
[1:21:58] be to eat away at Samson and eat away at
[1:22:00] him four different times trying to get
[1:22:02] to the heart of Samson Samson where does
[1:22:05] your hidden power lay am mean what is
[1:22:08] the strength of your life Samson you
[1:22:10] offend me you say you love me what is
[1:22:13] the hidden power of your life amen but
[1:22:16] but the thing was Samson had given his
[1:22:18] strength to the Lord but he gave his
[1:22:20] heart to Delilah is that right amen and
[1:22:24] so Thea found where the secret lays and
[1:22:27] Samson says there hath not come a razor
[1:22:30] upon mine head for I have been a
[1:22:32] Nazarite unto God from my mother's womb
[1:22:35] and if I be shaven then my strength will
[1:22:37] go from me and I shall become weak and
[1:22:40] be like any other man and so Delilah
[1:22:43] comes in and she begins to shave away
[1:22:46] those Seven Locks that lay upon his head
[1:22:49] and then she said Samson the Philistines
[1:22:52] be upon thee and he began to say I'll go
[1:22:55] out like every other time but he didn't
[1:22:57] realize that the Lord had departed from
[1:22:59] him amen there stood Samson and all of
[1:23:02] his glory his muscles were just as
[1:23:05] strong as ever his stature was just as
[1:23:08] strong as ever but he couldn't meet the
[1:23:10] challenge of the hour because the
[1:23:12] anointing of the Lord had departed from
[1:23:15] him am mean is that right and he found
[1:23:17] himself in a condition and he began to
[1:23:19] realize amen that his strength wasn't
[1:23:22] enough
[1:23:25] are are you with me I could I'm about
[1:23:29] 6'2 but if I was a dead man it don't
[1:23:32] matter how much muscle I have I would
[1:23:35] lay here like a pile of Flesh because
[1:23:37] it's the life that's in you that
[1:23:39] motivates you is that right it takes a
[1:23:42] life to motivate the muscle and so no
[1:23:45] matter how many muscles you have if
[1:23:47] there's no life in you it won't motivate
[1:23:49] you and no matter how many Faith muscles
[1:23:51] you have in your Christian walk without
[1:23:53] the spirit of the Lord to motivate it am
[1:23:58] it's not so much the muscle and Samson
[1:24:00] found out that that just knowing all the
[1:24:03] quotes wouldn't work amen Samson found
[1:24:06] out that just going to church on
[1:24:08] Wednesday and Sunday wouldn't be enough
[1:24:10] Samson found out that the mechanics
[1:24:12] wouldn't be enough it would take a
[1:24:14] Dynamics to come upon the mechanics to
[1:24:18] perform the work of the Lord amen and
[1:24:22] and and neither are the Dynamics good
[1:24:24] without the mechanics but it takes both
[1:24:27] it takes a mechanics and it takes the
[1:24:30] Dynamics amen I I think of that
[1:24:32] shunamite woman uh when she come in
[1:24:36] contact with the Elijah Ministry amen
[1:24:39] she was almost out of food for her and
[1:24:41] her family she was almost out of
[1:24:43] strength but when she was obedient to
[1:24:45] that Elijah Ministry and she sought
[1:24:48] first the kingdom of God and gave their
[1:24:50] meal and oil to that Elijah they come
[1:24:54] back forth a promise that the me would
[1:24:56] never run out and the oral wouldn't run
[1:24:58] dry until rain came on the earth amen
[1:25:01] you see what we're feasting on is meal
[1:25:04] and oil it's a word and Spirit Revival
[1:25:08] you you can't do away with one and keep
[1:25:11] the other and expect to have the
[1:25:13] strength to live an overcoming life amen
[1:25:16] it it's it's an unending
[1:25:19] Revival oh and it comes from the word of
[1:25:22] God as the spirit begins to Quicken it
[1:25:25] to you and the spirit begins to lead you
[1:25:28] through this message it's spiritual food
[1:25:30] and due season it'll it'll give you
[1:25:33] strength to the coming of the Lord amen
[1:25:37] it's a message that's full of vitamins
[1:25:40] amen but but you got to have the word
[1:25:42] and the spirit amen Samson's muscles Wen
[1:25:48] enough oh it would take the Dynamics am
[1:25:51] amen and I can imagine yes sir that this
[1:25:54] is the first time Samson has ever felt
[1:25:57] fear in his life probably for the very
[1:26:00] first time you see under that Nazarite
[1:26:03] vow that Samson lived under there was no
[1:26:07] fear he he wasn't afraid as long as he
[1:26:09] could feel that that's it you felt it
[1:26:13] you felt that anointing you felt that
[1:26:15] strength and as long as Samson lived
[1:26:18] under that Nazarite vow there was no
[1:26:20] fear amen amen but but like like I think
[1:26:24] of that eagle in the woods with brother
[1:26:26] Brandon that eagle was testing those two
[1:26:28] wings and as long as he knew those two
[1:26:31] wings were working he could fly away to
[1:26:33] safety any time amen under that Nazarite
[1:26:36] vow there was no fear but I can imagine
[1:26:40] for the first time Samson feels fear he
[1:26:43] said I'm not able to meet the challenge
[1:26:45] of the hour you see his long hair was
[1:26:48] his Nazarite vow that's right it showed
[1:26:51] that he'd cut himself from the world to
[1:26:54] to obey the
[1:26:55] word and brother Brandon would say that
[1:26:58] a hair to a woman is a Nazarite vow as
[1:27:01] well he said a
[1:27:03] Nazarite he said if a woman cuts off her
[1:27:05] hair she absolutely denies her Nazarite
[1:27:09] vow that she is a bride to Christ and
[1:27:13] brother brandom said a Nazarite is one
[1:27:15] that is consecrated for a
[1:27:18] purpose he said Samson was consecrated
[1:27:20] to a age and a purpose therefore he had
[1:27:24] long hair and the woman that's a child
[1:27:27] of God lets her hair grow to show that
[1:27:29] she's consecrated to every word of God
[1:27:32] now me it it may it it may get a little
[1:27:36] strong for a
[1:27:37] minute brother brandom said if she cuts
[1:27:40] it off I don't care how much she dances
[1:27:43] sings is in the choir or speaks in
[1:27:46] tongues or runs up and down or has all
[1:27:49] kind of Aid societies she is dead that's
[1:27:52] thus sayith the Lord the word of God she
[1:27:56] 1 Corinthians 14 she has denied her
[1:27:59] Nazarite vow and sold out to the God of
[1:28:02] this Modern Age oh and that's how the
[1:28:05] Pentecostal Church found themselves they
[1:28:08] they they had they had the worship they
[1:28:11] they had the dance they begin to speak
[1:28:13] in tongues as an Evidence but they would
[1:28:16] start to chop off their hair and start
[1:28:18] to put on pants and wear garments that
[1:28:21] pertain unto a man and the spirit of the
[1:28:23] Lord Lord would depart from them and
[1:28:25] they were left strengthless they were
[1:28:28] left because they had sheared away the
[1:28:30] word of God and brother brandom said
[1:28:33] committing SP spiritual
[1:28:36] fornications oh he said any word in the
[1:28:38] Bible That's rejected or if any self
[1:28:41] interpretation is put to it it's
[1:28:44] absolutely rejecting and committing
[1:28:47] adultery against the god that is your
[1:28:49] husband yes my brother take your time
[1:28:53] yes my brother
[1:28:55] yes sir we're talking about a vow
[1:28:58] now when I made a vow to my wife it was
[1:29:02] in sickness and in health in the good
[1:29:04] times and the bad times I am vowed to
[1:29:07] one woman and she's back in Ohio amen
[1:29:11] and when I'm on the road I'm not looking
[1:29:13] for any other thing I'm not looking for
[1:29:15] any other love I've got a wife and I
[1:29:18] have vowed myself to her and brother
[1:29:21] brandom said the bride of Christ is
[1:29:22] vowed to Christ and he is the word and
[1:29:26] he said that a a woman shouldn't even
[1:29:28] wink at another
[1:29:31] man well amen and that that's where a
[1:29:34] lot of the problems start sometimes it
[1:29:36] just starts with a wink amen and here
[1:29:39] with Samson
[1:29:40] intoa and sometimes it starts with a
[1:29:43] wink and then it progresses and
[1:29:46] progresses and you find yourself
[1:29:48] committing adultery with the one that
[1:29:50] you're vowed to amen and sometimes that
[1:29:53] wink my might be looking at a
[1:29:55] website about this message Man sometimes
[1:29:59] it starts with a wink uh maybe what they
[1:30:02] said about the Finland boy is true maybe
[1:30:04] what they said about the bridge is true
[1:30:07] and it starts with a wink and before you
[1:30:09] know it you're laying in an adulterous
[1:30:12] lap and you've lost your strength and
[1:30:14] you leave the message of the hour and
[1:30:17] you realize that you have no strength
[1:30:19] left you realize that the anointing has
[1:30:22] left you oh because you forsake even one
[1:30:25] word of God oh that's what the problem
[1:30:27] was Delilah be to shave off Samson's
[1:30:31] locks and that's what the problem
[1:30:33] brother Brandon would say that Luther
[1:30:35] was okay but they begin to build schools
[1:30:38] and begin to shave off Luther's locks
[1:30:40] and then they begin to shave off
[1:30:42] Wesley's locks and then they begin to
[1:30:44] shave off Pentecostal locks until they
[1:30:46] were left standing humiliated like a
[1:30:50] shorn woman without hair on her head or
[1:30:53] a born man amen and he said no wonder is
[1:30:57] juvenile
[1:30:58] delinquency he said no wonder the
[1:31:00] Secret's been discovered it's taking the
[1:31:03] baptism of the Holy Ghost out of the
[1:31:05] people and they're going for the things
[1:31:07] of the world instead of coming back to
[1:31:09] God Amen uh he would begin to rebuke
[1:31:13] even his own assembly he would begin to
[1:31:15] even rebuke brandom Tabernacle it say
[1:31:18] Samson the Philistines are upon you and
[1:31:21] he would say uh brandom Tabernacle
[1:31:24] worldism is creeping in among you he
[1:31:27] said what about it have you exposed your
[1:31:30] secret oh this is this is to the brandom
[1:31:33] Tabernacle he said have you exposed that
[1:31:35] secret that God give you when you were
[1:31:38] wallowing there in the sawdust a few
[1:31:40] years ago have you let it creep out with
[1:31:43] social former worship what's happened to
[1:31:45] you he said God can come down and
[1:31:48] perform a miracle and go right down
[1:31:50] through the audience and tell people the
[1:31:52] secrets of their heart and everything
[1:31:54] and heal the sick and Afflicted and do
[1:31:55] signs and wonders and preach his word as
[1:31:58] hard as they can by the Holy Ghost and
[1:32:00] people say well I guess that's all right
[1:32:04] we enjoy listening to it once in a while
[1:32:06] if we're not too tired and he would say
[1:32:08] brandom Tabernacle the Philistines are
[1:32:11] upon thee amen you realize the danger
[1:32:15] amen of losing your strength losing your
[1:32:19] enthusiasm you begin to cut off one lock

[1:32:25] strengthless amen but but but I as for
[1:32:28] me in my house amen if if it if it ever

[1:32:40] lot with a tambourine and worship my
[1:32:42] Lord amen if it ever comes to a place

[1:36:46] yes my
[1:36:47] bride oh
[1:36:50] it's what is it it's a Nazarite vow
[1:36:53] thank it's one that is consecrated for a
[1:36:57] purpose
[1:37:00] amen I don't believe God's looking for a
[1:37:03] halfway bride I believe he's looking for
[1:37:05] a Nazarite bride amen we're consecrated
[1:37:08] for a purpose am amen we are not the
[1:37:12] same this is a quote ye are separated
[1:37:15] people holy unto the Lord dedicated to
[1:37:18] the word and the spirit of God to bear
[1:37:20] fruit of his promise of this day and
[1:37:22] you're not of them you're supposed to be
[1:37:25] a different people but brother Brandon
[1:37:28] would read that poem we let down the
[1:37:30] bars we compromis with sin we let down
[1:37:33] the bars the Sheep got out what how did
[1:37:37] the goats get
[1:37:39] in it said you let down the
[1:37:42] bars you
[1:37:44] compromised and it may only have started
[1:37:46] with one word but that's what sent the
[1:37:49] whole human race and made one word
[1:37:53] man sheer and sheer and
[1:37:56] sheer you
[1:37:58] know there's sometimes where my little
[1:38:01] boy he's a year old now and he's arry as
[1:38:04] can get and he will sit over there and
[1:38:08] and do things that he knows he's not
[1:38:10] supposed to do just to get our attention
[1:38:12] and he'll open those cabinets and and
[1:38:15] there's there's there's cleaning and
[1:38:17] chemicals and things in there say no
[1:38:19] buddy you can't do that and and he'll
[1:38:21] open it again and we'll W his leg say no
[1:38:24] you can't do that and after about the H
[1:38:26] hundredth time you get a little tired
[1:38:30] and it would be easy just to stop
[1:38:33] correcting him because because you have
[1:38:35] to get up and and you have to make an
[1:38:37] effort and it would be easy to
[1:38:39] compromise but then what would happen to
[1:38:42] him he he he raise up and and and have
[1:38:45] no respect for what we say and and who
[1:38:48] knows how it would turn out and and
[1:38:50] they'd probably get in the cabinet and
[1:38:51] get hurt and and it would be easy to
[1:38:54] compromise but but we're dedicated to a
[1:38:57] purpose where a Nazarite people were
[1:38:59] consecrated to this age and this purpose
[1:39:03] we're dedicated to the word and spirit
[1:39:05] for our day amen and when my wife was in
[1:39:09] the hospital there comes a certain
[1:39:11] pressure that that maybe uh for me and
[1:39:13] for brother Wayne we bring greetings
[1:39:16] from Brother Wayne by the way that's
[1:39:18] that's his baby laying in that hospital
[1:39:20] and and and the the the enemy would try
[1:39:22] to come in and say just just hold off
[1:39:24] that preaching a little bit just I if
[1:39:27] you just compromised here then then I
[1:39:29] wouldn't attack your baby so much or I
[1:39:31] wouldn't attack your wife so much and it
[1:39:33] would be easy uh uh from that human
[1:39:36] element to
[1:39:37] compromise but we are under a Nazarite
[1:39:40] vow and would say Satan I will not
[1:39:43] compromise I will not bow down I will
[1:39:46] not bend the knee you're going to have
[1:39:48] to leave amen amen because I'm not
[1:39:51] moving I am not amen God gave us this
[1:39:54] land God gave us this third land God
[1:39:58] gave us our inheritance and we will not
[1:40:01] March back out of here because of some
[1:40:03] devil that would try to come in and
[1:40:06] steal our strength no sir oh we will not
[1:40:09] leave our promises we will not stop
[1:40:11] believing for our children we will not
[1:40:14] stop preaching healing we will not stop
[1:40:16] preaching the Holy Ghost no sir oh it
[1:40:19] may not be popular in this hour but we
[1:40:21] are not going to stop preaching amen
[1:40:24] amen amen say why is it so strong
[1:40:27] hallelujah hallelujah take your
[1:40:30] time if it was wrong before it's still
[1:40:35] wrong I I if cutting your hair was wrong
[1:40:38] before it's still wrong me if a woman
[1:40:41] wearing pants was wrong before it's
[1:40:43] still wrong it hasn't
[1:40:46] changed oh but by amen amen oh one
[1:40:51] generation after another oh because
[1:40:54] somebody doesn't have the strength to
[1:40:55] stand up and deal with it oh it creeps
[1:40:58] into the church and the next thing you
[1:41:01] know yes you have no strengths that's it
[1:41:04] worldism has creeped in exactly right
[1:41:07] why do we preach it so strong brother
[1:41:08] Stephen yes sir because the other day I
[1:41:11] was in my study and I just began to look
[1:41:14] at this quote where brother Brandon's
[1:41:16] talking about Moses and he said there
[1:41:18] Moses he was Vindicated there was a
[1:41:21] pillar of fire Vindicated him and and
[1:41:24] now he begins to say you shall not add
[1:41:27] onto the word which I command you
[1:41:29] neither shall you diminish odd of it it
[1:41:32] said don't add one thing to it and don't
[1:41:34] take one thing away from it stay just
[1:41:36] say what it says yes that you may keep
[1:41:39] the Commandments of the Lord your God
[1:41:40] which I command you brother Bram said
[1:41:42] this was Moses speaking to Israel after
[1:41:44] he had been Vindicated by God by a
[1:41:46] pillar of fire and knowed he was proven
[1:41:49] to be God's servant servant to lead them
[1:41:51] out and before they went into the land
[1:41:53] before they entered Moses said now the
[1:41:56] words that I have spoken unto you I call
[1:41:59] Heaven and Earth to witness against you
[1:42:01] if you add one thing to it or take one
[1:42:03] word from it you'll not stay in the land
[1:42:06] where the Lord God gives you and then
[1:42:09] brother brandom said so say I in the
[1:42:12] name of Jesus Christ don't you add one
[1:42:16] thing put your own ideas in you just say
[1:42:19] what is said on this you just do exactly
[1:42:22] what the Lord to do don't add to it am
[1:42:25] and farther down he says don't take some
[1:42:27] new
[1:42:28] thing everywhere be more than that come
[1:42:32] but don't take these new things amen
[1:42:35] Amen brother St as I begin to read that
[1:42:38] in my study I just closed my eyes and I
[1:42:42] took a vow before the Lord that as long
[1:42:44] as the Lord gives me strength and as
[1:42:47] long as the Lord gives me Grace I will
[1:42:49] stand for this message under a Nazarite
[1:42:52] vow and by the grace of God do what I
[1:42:55] can not to add one word or take one word
[1:42:58] from this message not to Shear off one
[1:43:01] thing from this message oh because it is
[1:43:04] the strength of my life amen amen it is
[1:43:07] our headship and brother Brandon would
[1:43:10] begin to say how there how how how there
[1:43:13] is a hope brother Bron would begin to
[1:43:15] say he said he said one hope we have
[1:43:19] that while they had Samson bound there
[1:43:22] was a new shock grow it out and he said
[1:43:25] I'm praying God that he'll grow it out
[1:43:26] of here somewhere a new shock that'll
[1:43:30] shake the Philistines like never before
[1:43:33] like they've never been shook before
[1:43:35] amen there'll be a skipping down
[1:43:36] there'll be a shock of power a secret
[1:43:39] power of the Holy Ghost grow out again
[1:43:42] just as certain as anything and it'll do
[1:43:45] the job in the last days God grant that
[1:43:48] we're all numbered with that shock when
[1:43:49] it comes out sir oh
[1:43:53] hallelujah thank God that there is a
[1:43:56] place that we can be identified that is
[1:43:59] not a strengthless people but I believe
[1:44:01] I'm identified with that new shock am me
[1:44:04] not just because I go to a message
[1:44:06] church but because I've been bursted
[1:44:10] under the word for my day there's been a
[1:44:13] new growth anden the Pentecostals pushed
[1:44:16] them out but oh in God's mercy those
[1:44:20] seven curls begin to grow back and God
[1:44:23] will have a bride God will have a people
[1:44:26] that are strengthened by the word God
[1:44:29] will have a people God will have a
[1:44:32] bride oh I said I will restore sayith
[1:44:35] the Lord all that the bugs have eaten I
[1:44:39] will
[1:44:40] restore oh oh it looks pretty dismal but
[1:44:45] then you look closely what is that on
[1:44:48] the back of Samson's head oh I see some
[1:44:51] hairs I see these Seven Locks amen and
[1:44:55] brother brandham said amen I he said but
[1:44:58] notice hallu and the spoken word is the
[1:45:01] Original Seed he said his preaching will
[1:45:02] be with the spirit and strength line of
[1:45:04] God's word talking about the messenger
[1:45:07] and the seed is not air with the Shu he
[1:45:09] said notice at the opening of The Seven
[1:45:11] Seals Revelation 10 the full word is to
[1:45:14] be born into manifestation again and
[1:45:17] Vindicated by the spirit of God in the
[1:45:19] full strength as it was when he was on
[1:45:22] Earth
[1:45:23] manifested in the same way doing the
[1:45:25] same things that it did when it was here
[1:45:27] on Earth Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[1:45:29] today and forever amen oh there's been a
[1:45:33] new shock grow out amen and I'm thankful
[1:45:37] for for men of God like brother Stephen
[1:45:40] that can be identified with the message
[1:45:42] of strength amen amen it's the strength
[1:45:46] of my life yes my brother and as we turn
[1:45:50] the corner here now
[1:45:53] David I think it's amazing that David
[1:45:56] wrote this
[1:45:57] scripture
[1:45:59] because if we backgound it in the early
[1:46:02] days of the children of Israel they were
[1:46:04] they were identified with that Pillar of
[1:46:06] Fire and me the almighty God was a
[1:46:10] father King to the children of Israel
[1:46:13] and me He brother the church age book
[1:46:15] here is describing how he he busied
[1:46:17] himself over them he he gave them Mana
[1:46:19] from Heaven he gave them all these
[1:46:22] things he was their father King he they
[1:46:24] were the only nation to which he was
[1:46:26] truly God but but they begin to look out
[1:46:29] at the Philistine Army and think my if I
[1:46:32] just if we just had a king like they do
[1:46:34] to lead us into battle you know and and
[1:46:37] the thing of it was God was going to
[1:46:39] give them that in the person Jesus
[1:46:40] Christ am me but they got ahead of the
[1:46:43] word exactly right and so they said we
[1:46:45] want a king like they do and they said
[1:46:47] we still want the priest to blow the
[1:46:49] trumpets we still want all the church
[1:46:51] order it's it's just that we want a king
[1:46:55] like them and we want human leadership
[1:46:59] instead of the leadership of God and
[1:47:02] when they re when they rejected that and
[1:47:05] their Samuel stood as a prophet in their
[1:47:07] midst who had the word of God and spake
[1:47:10] as a mouthpiece of God and it wasn't
[1:47:13] that they were rejecting Samuel they
[1:47:15] were rejecting the king they were
[1:47:17] rejecting the leadership of the Holy
[1:47:18] Ghost and when they rejected that they
[1:47:22] although they still sing the songs and
[1:47:23] did all those things they rejected the
[1:47:25] very thing that made them different they
[1:47:28] rejected the very thing it was that
[1:47:30] Pillar of Fire it was that leadership of
[1:47:32] the Holy Ghost that's what made him
[1:47:34] different you see brother brandom said
[1:47:36] the one difference between Israel and
[1:47:38] the rest of the Nations was God that's
[1:47:40] it the one difference that's it only one
[1:47:44] but God put God to the side and Israel
[1:47:46] was like any other Nation he said when
[1:47:48] Samson cut off his hair he was like any
[1:47:50] other man and when you put the leader
[1:47:52] leadership of the Holy Ghost aside and
[1:47:55] the church is nothing but the world with
[1:47:57] God's name attached to
[1:47:59] it and I say that because for a reason
[1:48:03] they rejected Samuel the word prophet
[1:48:06] and then they took Saul as the king
[1:48:09] that's as their human leadership they
[1:48:11] rejected the leadership of the Holy
[1:48:12] Ghost and took Saul right amen now in
[1:48:16] first Samuel 15 I if you can pull it up
[1:48:19] that'd be great if not that's okay we're
[1:48:21] just going to read through this real
[1:48:23] quick take your time now this is when
[1:48:25] Samuel comes to Saul right and he says
[1:48:28] the Lord sent me to anoint you to be
[1:48:30] king over his people over Israel now
[1:48:33] therefore hearken onto the voice of the
[1:48:35] words of the Lord and He commands them
[1:48:38] and begins to tell them to go and smite
[1:48:40] amalec and utterly destroy all that they
[1:48:43] have and spare them not and so Saul
[1:48:46] gathers his army and lies in weight and
[1:48:49] and he had the kenites depart from the
[1:48:51] amalekites and and so and so Saul goes
[1:48:54] into battle and and Saul smelt the
[1:48:57] amalekites from Hava until thou comest
[1:48:59] to sh that is over against Egypt and 1
[1:49:03] Samuel 15 I believe we're verse eight
[1:49:05] here it says and he took AAG King of the
[1:49:08] amalekites alive and utterly destroyed
[1:49:11] all the people with the edge of the
[1:49:12] sword but Saul and the people spared AAG
[1:49:16] and the best of the sheep and of The
[1:49:18] Oxen and of the fatlings and the Lambs
[1:49:21] and all that was good and would not
[1:49:23] utterly destroy them and so the Lord
[1:49:26] repented for even making Saul King amen
[1:49:30] and and so Samuel uh Saul comes and
[1:49:32] greets Samuel and and and Samuel um when
[1:49:35] the Lord says it repenteth me that I
[1:49:37] have set up Saul to be king for he has
[1:49:40] turned back from following me and hath
[1:49:42] not performed my Commandments and it
[1:49:44] grieved Samuel and he cried onto the
[1:49:46] Lord all night and when Samuel Rose
[1:49:48] early to meet Saul in the morning it was
[1:49:50] told Samuel saying Saul came to caramel
[1:49:53] and beheld he set him up a place and has
[1:49:56] gone about and passed on and gone down
[1:49:58] to gilo amen now listen closely here and
[1:50:02] Samuel came to Saul and Saul said unto
[1:50:04] him blessed be thou of the Lord I have
[1:50:06] performed the Commandment of the Lord so
[1:50:08] Samuel says then Sam then why can I hear
[1:50:11] sheep
[1:50:12] bleeding if you've performed the word of
[1:50:14] the Lord then what is that noise what
[1:50:18] are those animals bleeding and and the
[1:50:21] Lo of the ox and
[1:50:23] and Samuel says well we we've brought
[1:50:25] them from the amalekites and we' spared
[1:50:27] the best of the sheep and of the ox and
[1:50:29] to sacrifice unto the Lord and Samuel
[1:50:32] said stay and I will tell thee what the
[1:50:34] Lord has said to me this night and he
[1:50:35] said unto me say on and Samuel said when
[1:50:39] thou was little in thine own sight was
[1:50:41] thou not made the head of the tribes of
[1:50:43] Israel and the Lord Anointed The King
[1:50:46] over Israel and the Lord sent thee on a
[1:50:48] journey and said go utterly destroy the
[1:50:51] amalekites and fight against them until
[1:50:53] they be consumed wherefore then didst
[1:50:55] thou not obey the voice of the Lord but
[1:50:58] didst fly upon the spoil and did evil in
[1:51:00] the sight of the Lord you see s Saul he
[1:51:05] fell because of popularity is that right
[1:51:07] that's the voice of the people he took
[1:51:09] over the word of the Lord and he and he
[1:51:12] fell and he said Saul when thou was
[1:51:14] little in thine own sight that's right I
[1:51:16] exalt that you were exalted into a place
[1:51:18] of power you used to be little in your
[1:51:21] own sight and brother Brandon would say
[1:51:24] he would see people have an experience
[1:51:26] with the Holy Ghost and then go out on
[1:51:28] the field and deny it deny every bit of
[1:51:32] it because maybe they get a little buil
[1:51:33] up or they get a little popular and they
[1:51:36] would deny the very thing U but but but
[1:51:39] the Holy Ghost if it was good enough to
[1:51:41] save us brother step it's good enough
[1:51:43] for me it's good enough to keep us amen
[1:51:46] but the problem was popularity begin to
[1:51:48] set in and we realize amen that God has
[1:51:51] placed his anoint ing Upon Our Lives
[1:51:54] amen and if he would ever remove it then
[1:51:56] this is just about a a couple dollars
[1:51:58] worth of chemicals and dust there's
[1:52:01] nothing good about Isaac Hatfield amen
[1:52:03] but the god of Abraham Isaac and Jacob
[1:52:06] has put his favor upon my life amen
[1:52:09] because of his grace and his mercy and
[1:52:11] without that I'm helpless without that
[1:52:14] I'm nothing but Saul began to fall and
[1:52:17] say I have
[1:52:19] obeyed and he would say Samuel said hath
[1:52:21] the Lord is great Delight in burnt
[1:52:23] offerings and sacrifices as in obeying
[1:52:26] the voice of the Lord and he would begin
[1:52:28] to say behold to obey is better than
[1:52:30] sacrifice saw you should have just
[1:52:32] obeyed the word saw you you did a little
[1:52:35] too much
[1:52:37] extracurricular you had a command but
[1:52:40] here you spared King AAG here you spared
[1:52:43] these animals amen it would have been uh
[1:52:45] uh better to just obey and because thou
[1:52:48] Hast rejected the word of the Lord he
[1:52:50] hath also rejected thee from being
[1:52:53] King oh my that's pretty hard Saul said
[1:52:58] unto Samuel I have sinned for I have
[1:53:01] transgressed the Commandment of the Lord
[1:53:02] and thy words because I feared the
[1:53:04] people and obeyed their voice problem
[1:53:06] and and now therefore I pray thee paron
[1:53:08] my sin and turn again with me that I may
[1:53:11] Worship the Lord and Samuel said unto
[1:53:13] Saul I will not return with thee for
[1:53:16] thou Hast rejected the word of the Lord
[1:53:18] and the Lord hath rejected thee from
[1:53:20] being King over Israel and then in verse
[1:53:23] 28 it says and Samuel said unto him the
[1:53:25] Lord hath rent the Kingdom of Israel
[1:53:27] from thee this day and hath given it to
[1:53:29] a neighbor of thine which is better than
[1:53:32] thee amen amen now the kingdom begins to
[1:53:35] transfer to David yes my brother and
[1:53:38] then it says in verse 29 and also the
[1:53:41] strength of Israel will not lie nor
[1:53:44] repent for he is not a man that he
[1:53:46] should repent and there Saul hewed King
[1:53:50] AAG into pieces there in front of the
[1:53:53] Lord and me he did what s Saul should
[1:53:55] have done forgive me Samuel HED him into
[1:53:58] pieces what Saul should have done in the
[1:54:00] first place but he heeded to popularity
[1:54:04] but there there begins to come a
[1:54:05] transfer amen and now in Psalms 52 it's
[1:54:09] a it's a it's a Psalm of David when doe
[1:54:12] the adomite came and told Saul and and
[1:54:15] in verse seven it says lo this is the
[1:54:17] man that made not God his strength but
[1:54:20] trusted in the abundance of his riches
[1:54:22] and strengthened himself in his
[1:54:24] wickedness but I am like a green olive
[1:54:26] tree in the house of God I trust in the
[1:54:29] mercy of God forever and ever amen amen
[1:54:34] can you stay with me just for a few more
[1:54:36] minutes as we as we close down here amen
[1:54:38] this was the man that wrote in Psalms
[1:54:40] that God is the strength of my heart and
[1:54:43] my portion forever this is the one this
[1:54:46] is David who wrote Thou Art the god of
[1:54:49] my strength the rock of my strength this
[1:54:52] this is David who had also come from
[1:54:54] Small Beginnings he had been snatched
[1:54:58] from the uh from a shepherd and a sheep
[1:55:00] coat and lifted up to royalty but the
[1:55:03] difference was David knew where his
[1:55:05] strength came from David when he got a
[1:55:08] little bit of a little bit of prestige
[1:55:11] he didn't he didn't forsake the Lord but
[1:55:14] constantly he would be riding Oh Lord
[1:55:17] You're the strength of my life oh Lord
[1:55:19] the wicked even my enemies come against
[1:55:22] me
[1:55:23] uh Lord but you're the strength of my
[1:55:25] life amen and the Lord is the strength
[1:55:28] of Israel now in Isaiah 30 it says that
[1:55:32] walk to go down into Egypt and have not
[1:55:34] asked at my mouth to strengthen
[1:55:37] themselves in the strength of pharaoh
[1:55:38] and to trust in the shadow of Egypt
[1:55:41] therefore shall the strength of pharaoh
[1:55:43] be your shame and the Trust In the
[1:55:46] shadow of Egypt your confusion now I uh
[1:55:49] we don't have it up on the screen I wish
[1:55:51] we did but I come through the the
[1:55:54] scriptures here and strength is
[1:55:56] mentioned in the Bible about
[1:55:58] 230 some times I believe but in the book
[1:56:01] of 1 Samuel 15 that we just read that it
[1:56:04] said the strength of Israel is not a man
[1:56:07] that he could lie just paraphrasing in
[1:56:10] that scripture it's a capital S strength
[1:56:13] of Israel amen amen and that strikes me
[1:56:17] amen as very significant because we've
[1:56:19] just read about the strength of pharaoh
[1:56:22] we just read about different
[1:56:25] strengths but there's only one capital S
[1:56:29] anden there's only one Capital strength
[1:56:31] and that's the strength of Israel amen
[1:56:34] now now now that's the same strength
[1:56:36] that brought Moses and the children of
[1:56:38] Israel out of Egypt amen that's the same
[1:56:41] strength that was with Joshua when he
[1:56:43] crossed over Jordan that's the same
[1:56:45] strength that was with Gideon that's the
[1:56:47] same strength that was with Samson
[1:56:49] that's the same strength that was with
[1:56:51] Enoch and David the strength of Israel
[1:56:55] was with Daniel and the lionen the
[1:56:57] strength of Israel was with Rahab and
[1:57:00] Esther and Tamar and I don't believe
[1:57:03] it's just the strength of Israel but I
[1:57:05] believe it's the same strength to this
[1:57:07] Gentile bride that come down in the
[1:57:10] upper room and F 120 vessels I believe
[1:57:14] it's the same strength that come into
[1:57:15] brother brandom's meetings and said you
[1:57:17] live at such and such an address and
[1:57:20] you're from such and such a place that's
[1:57:21] right amen I believe it's the same
[1:57:24] strength that opened this messag amen
[1:57:27] amen I believe it's the same strength
[1:57:29] that would say I take every spirit in
[1:57:31] this building under my control amen I
[1:57:34] believe the Lord himself shall descend
[1:57:36] with a shout and I believe there's
[1:57:39] benefits to his strength yes sir the
[1:57:42] same strength brother that created You
[1:57:45] Out of the Dust of this Earth huj I
[1:57:46] believe it's that same strength that can
[1:57:49] heal your body amen amen I believe the
[1:57:51] same strength
[1:57:53] that called you is the same strength
[1:57:55] that can keep you I'm talking about the
[1:57:58] strength of Israel I'm talking about
[1:58:01] capital S I'm talking about the one who
[1:58:04] had his picture taken with brother
[1:58:05] brandom I'm talking about the one in
[1:58:07] that picture brother identified that's
[1:58:10] my Lord up there what was it a strength
[1:58:14] had descended back onto the church yes
[1:58:16] siren it's the same strength that's with
[1:58:18] us it's the same strength that's keeping
[1:58:20] you yes sir it's the keeping P why are
[1:58:23] you still here Church why are you still
[1:58:26] here when you've been through trials and
[1:58:28] you've been through tests and you've
[1:58:29] been through so many things and you're
[1:58:31] still here it's the same strength amen
[1:58:34] amen that kept that kept men Through the
[1:58:37] Ages oh it's the same strength that's
[1:58:40] keeping you oh the strength that called
[1:58:43] you it can keep you amen it's the
[1:58:47] strength in the midst of Trials when
[1:58:49] brother brandham had lost his mother and
[1:58:51] wife and he come to a junction amen amen
[1:58:55] but what happened the devil's trying to
[1:58:57] tell him that you've served the Lord
[1:58:59] you've done all these things and look
[1:59:02] where you're at oh why don't you just
[1:59:04] give up why don't you just stop serving
[1:59:06] the lord but something come over brother
[1:59:09] Brandon was in a place of decision is
[1:59:10] that right but something come over him
[1:59:14] oh and he said the lord giveth and the
[1:59:16] lord taketh away blessed be the name of
[1:59:20] the Lord and this just struck me you
[1:59:22] know what brother Bram said he said I
[1:59:24] felt relief amen and that strikes me
[1:59:27] because you see the devil would try to
[1:59:29] tell him that the Lord's forsaken you
[1:59:31] and and and if you just stop serving the
[1:59:33] lord you you'll get relief that way but
[1:59:36] that's not the case there's no relief in
[1:59:39] the devil's proposition but when brother
[1:59:41] brandham took a stand with the Lord and
[1:59:44] said the Lord gives and the Lord takes
[1:59:45] away and blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:59:48] there come a relief over him amen and I
[1:59:51] know the Lord's press
[1:59:52] I know the enemy is pressing you I know
[1:59:54] you're in great trials and great great
[1:59:57] heartaches at times and you feel like
[2:00:00] you have you're out of strength oh but
[2:00:04] just take sides with the word amen amen
[2:00:09] now is not the time to compromise now is
[2:00:11] not the time to give up now is not the
[2:00:14] time to let down oh it's the strength
[2:00:17] you know what when my when my wife when
[2:00:21] my wife was there
[2:00:23] in the hospital for for six about six
[2:00:27] days and then we had a youth camp coming
[2:00:30] up and there was something in her said
[2:00:33] I've got to be at that
[2:00:35] camp and and and the Lord had even
[2:00:38] before then begin moving in such
[2:00:40] miraculous ways I I I seen the Lord do
[2:00:44] things that seemed impossible I I seen
[2:00:48] the Lord working in a way we never
[2:00:50] thought maybe even that
[2:00:52] could
[2:00:53] happen but she said I've got to be at
[2:00:55] that youth
[2:00:57] camp and here she comes and and just
[2:01:00] just a few days before she could
[2:01:03] couldn't even hardly leave the house she
[2:01:05] could couldn't even walk outside hardly
[2:01:08] didn't have the strength would have
[2:01:10] seizures and and here she comes into
[2:01:13] this camp and and and we'd have to even
[2:01:16] almost carry her out of the service at
[2:01:19] times because she would have these
[2:01:21] seizures and things and and and she
[2:01:23] would go outside and rest for a few
[2:01:26] minutes and get something to drink and
[2:01:27] and come back in and and there where
[2:01:31] they're about to have a prayer line
[2:01:32] service and and and she would stand
[2:01:35] there in the back and and it amazed me
[2:01:37] because there she was she would be
[2:01:39] fighting through seizures and and and
[2:01:41] and instead of being just distraught she
[2:01:43] would just lift up her hands and start
[2:01:46] start praising the Lord she she she when
[2:01:49] she didn't hardly have any strength she
[2:01:51] would stand on feet and just start start
[2:01:53] entering into the service and then when
[2:01:56] she went through that prayer line
[2:01:59] Amen in an instant all the all the
[2:02:02] anxiety and all the depression left her
[2:02:06] amen and I I could say to her amen we'll
[2:02:11] give God the
[2:02:14] glory and if I could ask her Bethany
[2:02:17] what was your
[2:02:18] strength it was the same strength
[2:02:22] it was the same strength of Israel that
[2:02:25] brought them through the Red
[2:02:26] Sea where does your strength come from
[2:02:30] Hallelujah you know there's something
[2:02:31] that I'm realizing friends yes sir that
[2:02:34] the God that I serve amen isn't a
[2:02:37] different God than the god of Abraham
[2:02:40] Isaac and
[2:02:41] Jacob I I I've believed that but it's
[2:02:44] becoming very real to me even
[2:02:47] lately when you when I come to church
[2:02:50] Hallelujah when I enter my prayer closet
[2:02:52] Hallelujah the God that I serve amen is
[2:02:56] is not a different God hallelujah it's
[2:02:59] the strength of
[2:03:01] Israel it it it's Jehovah the Old
[2:03:03] Testament it's Jesus of the
[2:03:06] new amen amen and in the presence of the
[2:03:10] Lord amen if we could just recognize yes
[2:03:14] my the potential yes sir he's the
[2:03:17] everpresent God hallelujah he's the god
[2:03:21] of the valley Hallelujah he's the god of
[2:03:24] the
[2:03:25] mountain oh oh oh David would
[2:03:29] say hallelujah wheer shall I go from thy
[2:03:33] Spirit whe shall I flee from thy
[2:03:36] presence if I Ascend up into heaven Thou
[2:03:39] Art there if I make my bed in hell
[2:03:42] behold Thou Art there that just struck
[2:03:46] me even just I think earlier today I I
[2:03:49] was looking at that you know
[2:03:52] Saul rejected the word right and the
[2:03:55] Lord repented that he ever made him a
[2:03:58] king right but here David full of
[2:04:03] mistakes full of
[2:04:05] failures and he he would say Lord I
[2:04:09] can't even get away from your
[2:04:11] presence Lord you're you're my
[2:04:13] strength lord I can't even I can't even
[2:04:16] Escape your mercy lord I can't even
[2:04:19] Escape Your Grace you see there must
[2:04:22] have been something about David that was
[2:04:23] different than Saul there must have been
[2:04:26] an element of election over his life he
[2:04:29] was a man after God's Own Heart that his
[2:04:32] lineage would come forth through that
[2:04:35] line there must have been something
[2:04:37] about him that even in his mistakes and
[2:04:39] his failures oh he say Lord somehow
[2:04:43] you're ever present when I'm in the
[2:04:45] mountain you're there and when you lead
[2:04:48] me to the valley you're still the lily
[2:04:50] of the valley you're the everpresent god
[2:04:53] you're the never failing God like
[2:04:56] brother brandom had that Vision don't
[2:04:57] fear to go and do anything for the ever
[2:05:00] presentent the never failing presence of
[2:05:02] the Lord is with you wherever you go in
[2:05:05] Church of the Living God the everpresent
[2:05:07] presence is with the Church of the
[2:05:10] Living God the strength of the Lord is
[2:05:13] still with his people leading us and
[2:05:16] guiding us if we could just recognize
[2:05:19] amen and maybe sometimes Hallelujah we
[2:05:22] just need a little attitude
[2:05:24] adjustment we we come to church but
[2:05:27] we're really not here right we we come
[2:05:31] to church and and we're we're we're just
[2:05:33] worried about the day and we fail to
[2:05:37] recognize that we are in the presence of
[2:05:40] the everpresent
[2:05:41] god and Martha when she recognized that
[2:05:45] presence she said even now even now Lord
[2:05:49] I've had disappointments yes sir my
[2:05:52] brother's in a grave but even now Lord
[2:05:55] and brother Brandon would say that she's
[2:05:58] at the right place Hallelujah before the
[2:06:01] right Divine person with the right
[2:06:04] mental attitude speaking the right words
[2:06:07] believing the right things them old cogs
[2:06:11] is working right together something has
[2:06:12] to happen Amen brother brandom said you
[2:06:15] put me on record tonight in these
[2:06:16] recorders I have no apology for this
[2:06:19] remark that I'm fixing to make I believe
[2:06:21] in prove that the right mental attitude
[2:06:24] towards any Divine promise of God will
[2:06:26] bring it to pass the right mental
[2:06:29] attitude but you've got to have the
[2:06:30] right attitude the attitude is what
[2:06:32] brings the results I believe it but I
[2:06:35] don't know now that's not the right
[2:06:37] attitude the right attitude is to
[2:06:39] receive it and say it's thus sayith the
[2:06:41] Lord then it's right and brother Brandon
[2:06:43] said no one ever came to Christ in the
[2:06:45] right attitude but what went away with
[2:06:48] what they asked for No One amen amen
[2:06:52] amen I I think it's you come to a place
[2:06:54] sometimes where you got to get your
[2:06:55] attitude right amen and brother Brandon
[2:06:58] say sometimes with gifts and callings
[2:07:00] amen the musicians can come sometimes
[2:07:03] with gifts and callings It's usually the
[2:07:04] one that runs from it that God chooses
[2:07:07] because he said that these other men
[2:07:09] would say I want more power to move
[2:07:11] mountains and and brother brenon would
[2:07:13] say God can you give me power to move
[2:07:15] mountains he said I'll tell you I'll do
[2:07:17] something for you if you let me move
[2:07:18] mountains he said he wouldn't he
[2:07:20] couldn't can't even move himself to the
[2:07:22] right attitude that's it so he would
[2:07:24] never move mountains for God that's it
[2:07:27] Oh but you can come to the place amen
[2:07:30] you stop looking at the symptoms amen
[2:07:33] and say Lord I see Lord amen I read in
[2:07:37] the Bible about the strength of Israel
[2:07:40] amen and Lord it was a capital S Lord it
[2:07:43] must have been talking about
[2:07:45] youen Lord I read about a God that
[2:07:48] wasn't just a god of the mountains but a
[2:07:50] god of the valley amen and Lord you said
[2:07:52] if I ask I shall receive you said if I
[2:07:56] seek I shall find am you said if I knock
[2:07:59] it shall be opened unto me you said Lord
[2:08:01] that all things are possible to them
[2:08:03] that believe you said if you say to this
[2:08:05] mountain be that removed and cast into
[2:08:07] the sea it may not happen right away but
[2:08:10] Lord when you spoke it but it brought
[2:08:12] the right attitude brother Brandon would
[2:08:14] say someone come I believe it's in the
[2:08:16] prayer line and and was wanting a baby
[2:08:18] and the Lord would speak back to her
[2:08:20] thus sayith the Lord that she would have
[2:08:22] that baby and she went and she started
[2:08:24] to get the booties ready and started to
[2:08:26] get everything ready because what
[2:08:27] happened when that word hit her heart it
[2:08:30] put her in the right attitude amen and
[2:08:32] when you feed on this word amen it
[2:08:35] begins to put strength back into you it
[2:08:37] begins to put your attitude right and
[2:08:40] you say
[2:08:41] oh Lord I may feel sick but by your
[2:08:45] stripes I am healed that's it I may feel
[2:08:47] bound but by the authority of your word
[2:08:50] I am free amen
[2:08:52] amen when's the last time you just said
[2:08:54] it I am free I am free amen oh when you
[2:08:57] didn't feel like it but you said I am
[2:08:59] free amen I am free amen for the Bible
[2:09:02] said let the weak say I am strong I am
[2:09:06] strong amen amen oh you may not feel
[2:09:09] like it tonight Hallelujah but our
[2:09:11] strength doesn't come from our feelings
[2:09:13] hallelujah our strength comes from the
[2:09:15] word amen amen like Abraham amen amen
[2:09:19] I'm out of time I've got L there but
[2:09:25] Abraham oh yeah that's right the Lord
[2:09:28] began to build a covenant with him amen
[2:09:31] amen and he begin to show him an
[2:09:33] unconditional Covenant amen but as he
[2:09:37] moved through Genesis he confirmed what
[2:09:40] he was going to do how he's going to do
[2:09:41] it Abraham went through those stages
[2:09:44] right but he come to Genesis
[2:09:46] 17 he's 99 years old and Sarah is 89 and
[2:09:50] the Lord appears to him as El
[2:09:53] sh oh he said Abraham amen I know you're
[2:09:58] weak Sarah's you're you're as good as
[2:10:01] dead your bodies are as good as dead
[2:10:03] Abraham but I've given you a
[2:10:06] promise that the seed's not going to
[2:10:08] come forth through another man but it's
[2:10:10] going to come forth through you and
[2:10:12] Sarah how's it going to be Lord oh let
[2:10:16] me just open your eyes to something I've
[2:10:19] been walking with you but now I'm I'm
[2:10:21] going to show you who I am amen one of
[2:10:23] my names I'm El
[2:10:26] Shadi Abraham I know it looks impossible
[2:10:29] but you're going to have a baby amen and
[2:10:32] in order to have that baby you're going
[2:10:34] to need a new body so Abraham you just
[2:10:37] draw yourself up and begin Nursing From
[2:10:39] the promises because it was elhadi
[2:10:42] because brother Brandon would show us
[2:10:44] that he was wounded for our
[2:10:45] transgressions and Bruise for our
[2:10:47] iniquities he said it's healing for the
[2:10:49] body and healing for the spirit I mean
[2:10:53] because usually you're battling in at
[2:10:54] least one of those Realms almost all the
[2:10:57] time but God has provided for you a
[2:11:00] strength am you see elshad wasn't for
[2:11:02] every age elshad didn't belong but
[2:11:06] brother brandham said that's what he
[2:11:07] done to the Pentecostals after Wesley's
[2:11:09] age he let the Pentecostals nurse his
[2:11:11] own strength his own Holy Spirit as a
[2:11:14] baptism back into their weak bodies to
[2:11:17] give them faith for the Rapture amen
[2:11:19] faith for the Miracles I shadow the eye
[2:11:22] what he did to Abraham and to his seat
[2:11:23] after him watch believing confirmation
[2:11:26] blood Covenant now injecting himself his
[2:11:29] strength into the people amen it didn't
[2:11:32] belong to every age but in in our hour
[2:11:36] God is injected his own strength yes my
[2:11:39] brother into the church yes sir because
[2:11:41] we're reading out of Psalms 27h that's a
[2:11:44] a Rapture text oh and the strength that
[2:11:47] I'm talking about it's a strength that
[2:11:50] you can nurse
[2:11:52] from that will lead you all the way like
[2:11:55] Abraham and Sarah to a body change to
[2:11:59] bring forth a promised
[2:12:01] son would you stand to your feet tonight
[2:12:04] it's the strength of Israel it's not
[2:12:07] just to Abraham but it's to his
[2:12:10] seed and instead of getting weaker we're
[2:12:14] getting
[2:12:15] stronger oh the church is getting weaker
[2:12:18] every time every
[2:12:19] hour every age but the bride is getting
[2:12:24] stronger and in the midst of lead DEA in
[2:12:26] The Darkest Hour we've ever been we're
[2:12:29] stronger than we've ever been
[2:12:31] before because we're Nursing From
[2:12:35] elhi it doesn't matter how low you
[2:12:38] get you
[2:12:40] know brother Bram tells about that Paul
[2:12:43] Raider and we're all familiar with it
[2:12:45] but he told it this way in a way that
[2:12:48] just struck me he said Paul had that
[2:12:51] dream of trying to get that log back to
[2:12:53] the
[2:12:54] camp but you know I think usually I've
[2:12:57] imagined it that it was a great big tree
[2:13:00] that he he wouldn't you know have the
[2:13:03] strength to carry back but the way
[2:13:04] brother Brandon tells it here it's it's
[2:13:06] a tree that he would normally have the
[2:13:08] strength to carry but he had just gotten
[2:13:11] weak his strength was gone but in the
[2:13:15] time of his weakness the Lord would
[2:13:17] speak and say oh there's a river right
[2:13:19] over there just roll it into the river
[2:13:23] Paul would say I usually have the
[2:13:24] strength to carry these but I'm just
[2:13:27] weak you ever get to that
[2:13:30] place all this Christian Journey
[2:13:33] sometimes you start off you feel so
[2:13:35] strong you find yourself at a place
[2:13:38] where you come to a juniper tree Lord I
[2:13:42] don't have the strength to go on brother
[2:13:45] brandom said when he come to that place
[2:13:47] he tried to take his own life twice
[2:13:50] that's the seven thing Angel messenger
[2:13:52] had got so
[2:13:53] low he tried to take his own life but
[2:13:57] God had prepared a place where he could
[2:14:00] renew his
[2:14:02] strength and sometimes you get to that
[2:14:05] place but God has prepared a
[2:14:08] way all that you don't have to carry
[2:14:10] that load
[2:14:12] anymore just come nurse from my
[2:14:16] promises nourish yourself back to
[2:14:19] strength amen if we could bow our heads
[2:14:22] and close our
[2:14:25] [Music]
[2:14:27] eyes in the time of
[2:14:31] weakness in a time of
[2:14:33] absolute where you feel like you've
[2:14:35] reached the end of your
[2:14:38] strength maybe that's you
[2:14:40] tonight maybe you feel like you've
[2:14:43] reached the end of your
[2:14:45] strength you feel like you can't go on
[2:14:48] another day maybe somebody that's on the
[2:14:51] the
[2:14:51] stream maybe you've even had thoughts of
[2:14:54] taking your own life cuz you just feel
[2:14:57] like you don't have the strength to
[2:14:59] fight another day you're weary you're so
[2:15:03] weary you cry out to the Lord Lord why
[2:15:07] has Thou forsaken me Lord why has you
[2:15:10] left me in this Valley Lord I don't have
[2:15:13] my own strength Lord why have you left
[2:15:16] me here Lord I prayed and I cried out
[2:15:19] and I'm I'm still sick sick I I prayed
[2:15:22] and I cried out and I'm still
[2:15:25] battling Lord why have you left
[2:15:28] me oh but God knows where you're at
[2:15:32] tonight God knows the condition you're
[2:15:35] in and he's still the everpresent
[2:15:38] God Amen and he's given us promises that
[2:15:43] after you have suffered I'll establish
[2:15:46] you I'll strengthen you I'll settle you
[2:15:51] in the book of Hebrews he said for
[2:15:53] verily for a few days he's chasten
[2:15:56] enough to ask his own pleasure but for a
[2:15:58] prophet
[2:15:59] prophet he said no chastening for the
[2:16:02] present seeth to be joyous but Grievous
[2:16:04] nevertheless
[2:16:06] afterward it yieldeth the Peaceable
[2:16:08] fruit of
[2:16:09] righteousness unto them which are
[2:16:11] exercised thereby wherefore lift up the
[2:16:14] hands which hang down in the feeble
[2:16:16] knees and make straight paths for your
[2:16:18] feet lest that which is lame be turned
[2:16:20] turned out of the way let it rather be
[2:16:23] healed you see L your struggle is
[2:16:25] temporary
[2:16:27] hallu oh but almighty God is
[2:16:31] eternal he's not left
[2:16:34] you he's never left
[2:16:37] you maybe you've lost the joy of your
[2:16:39] salvation
[2:16:42] tonight Nehemiah wrote that the joy of
[2:16:45] the Lord is our
[2:16:46] strength and you've lost your joy Maybe
[2:16:50] maybe the devil's tried to isolate you
[2:16:53] in a complex self-pity maybe thinking
[2:16:57] nobody in the church loves you maybe
[2:17:01] thinking God doesn't even love
[2:17:03] you oh and you don't no longer have the
[2:17:07] strength of joy in your
[2:17:09] life but I believe God can do for you
[2:17:12] like David restore the joy of your
[2:17:16] salvation you remember what it was like
[2:17:18] when you first got saved yes Lord you
[2:17:21] remember what it was like when you felt
[2:17:22] like you had strength to to to to to
[2:17:25] just defeat every enemy that raised its
[2:17:28] head and now you feel like you don't
[2:17:30] even have strength to lift up your
[2:17:31] sword oh but I believe elshad eyes is in
[2:17:35] the
[2:17:37] room I believe the strength of Israel is
[2:17:40] in the room
[2:17:41] tonight I don't just say that he said
[2:17:45] wherever two or three are
[2:17:47] gathered oh just begin to get a right
[2:17:49] attitude towards him now
[2:17:52] maybe you've had a need for some
[2:17:54] time maybe you've even been offended at
[2:17:57] the Lord that he hasn't answered it
[2:17:59] yet but instead of crying out and
