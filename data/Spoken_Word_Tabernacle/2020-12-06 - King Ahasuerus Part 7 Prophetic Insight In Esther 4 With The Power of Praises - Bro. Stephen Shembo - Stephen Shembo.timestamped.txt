[1:26] Hallelujah
[1:30] you know
[1:31] uh I like the part where the men sing
[1:35] where he he talks about uh to feel the
[1:37] warmth of your
[1:39] Embrace I mean you know for a man you
[1:42] know embracing or whatever but um I
[1:46] always felt like the song was special
[1:49] because it gave the men that part it
[1:51] just it's just
[1:54] uh to imagine Embrace from God you know
[2:00] now this next
[2:02] one
[2:04] um I kind of felt led to sing this from
[2:07] I don't know I've had it on my heart for
[2:09] a while I was trying to find a song and
[2:11] somebody may be able to help me it's
[2:13] from years ago it says I wasn't
[2:18] there when they did you know several
[2:21] things but I was you know this one is
[2:24] were you
[2:25] there and you know typically we always
[2:28] kind of sang it around Easter
[2:31] but today is Resurrection Day
[2:33] anyways and and until I find the other
[2:36] song I just kind of felt a little bit
[2:38] led to sing this one this morning
[2:43] uh we won't sing all the verses of it
[2:47] but you know there's
[2:50] just there's
[2:52] just I might not have been there for a
[2:55] lot of things to see a lot of things I
[2:57] didn't witness the red getting parted
[3:00] but I was
[3:01] there I didn't get to see Jesus nailed
[3:05] to the tree I didn't I wasn't a witness
[3:07] to that I can't take you to a cross I
[3:09] can't I might be able to take you to the
[3:11] vicinity of it if we go to Jerusalem on
[3:13] the hill of gotha but I was
[3:16] there and when he raised from the
[3:19] grave I was
[3:21] there I didn't see it but I didn't have
[3:25] to see
[3:27] it there's something in my heart know
[3:31] true it's the same thing with this
[3:35] message I didn't see everything I didn't
[3:39] I was four years old when brother
[3:40] brandom
[3:42] died but God's grace is big enough and
[3:46] it was
[3:47] sufficient to bring me in when I was
[3:49] about
[3:50] 30 you
[3:53] know so to me I didn't have to see those
[3:57] things I know that they
[4:01] and I know this message changed my
[4:04] life and I'm the evidence of the
[4:08] message you are the evidence that it's
[4:12] true and it's
[4:15] real and it's Jesus Christ because
[4:18] nobody else could have such a profound
[4:21] effect so if I can compose myself again
[4:24] we'll sing this song I think it's a d
[4:27] I'm not positive

[39:10] this morning thank you all and greet all
[39:14] our family members that came this
[39:16] morning God richly bless you when I say
[39:20] family member means we don't have
[39:22] visitors in this church we have family
[39:24] member you home with Brothers
[39:28] and sooner we're going to stand over
[39:31] there in heaven and stay for eternity
[39:34] never to depart anymore and we're going
[39:36] to have one church is be in the city and
[39:39] everybody will be there amen you might
[39:42] be seated for a
[39:48] minute last Wednesday we had a wonderful
[39:52] wonderful
[39:54] wonderful sermon the hand of the
[39:57] diligent if you miss that I will
[40:00] encourage you whether you young people
[40:02] old people whichever age you are go
[40:05] ahead and listen to that sermon at the
[40:08] end I made a comment and I gave my own
[40:12] example how I went to school and I I was
[40:16] traveling for four years and I was
[40:19] giving that example to just back up the
[40:22] brother and to show that it takes
[40:25] diligence to reach a c certain goal so
[40:30] we're not here to put oursel up like we
[40:32] Big Shot there is no big shot in this
[40:35] church the only one is the Lord Jesus
[40:38] Christ amen so I just want the church to
[40:41] understand when we bring an example when
[40:43] we talk about Brother David doing
[40:45] something brother Michael doing
[40:46] something or sometime I might bring my
[40:48] own example that's the reason why I say
[40:51] we are boasting in the Lord so whatever
[40:54] we do we're doing that in the Lord amen
[40:57] if we accomplish something in this life
[40:59] we did it by the grace of God Amen there
[41:03] is always cou of scripture that comes
[41:05] back to me all the time and these are
[41:08] like the scriptures of My Life The Devil
[41:11] is fighting for
[41:13] nothing it's 1 Corinthians chapter 4:7
[41:16] the Bible say for who maketh thee to die
[41:20] from one from another in other word who
[41:23] makes you different from somebody else
[41:26] and what has
[41:27] that that did not receive so there is
[41:30] nothing we have in this world we did not
[41:33] receive even though you think you work
[41:35] for it it is God that gave it to you
[41:39] amen and Paul continue he says now if
[41:42] that did receive it from the Lord why do
[41:46] thou Glory as if th has not receive it
[41:50] like I did this with my own power you
[41:52] didn't do that the one who gave you that
[41:56] strength is God the one who gave you
[41:58] that intelligence is God the one who
[42:00] gave you the job is God you can get fire
[42:05] anytime amen so whether we accomplish
[42:08] something here we did it by the grace of
[42:11] God Amen and Paul continues again in 2
[42:15] Corinthians chapter 3:5 he says not that
[42:19] we are sufficient of ourself to think
[42:23] anything as of ourselves but our
[42:27] sufficiency is of God so young people
[42:32] keep those scripture for your life
[42:34] whether you do something whether you
[42:36] accomplish something in this life always
[42:38] remember you did it by the grace of God
[42:41] you did it because of God if God would
[42:44] not have allowed you to have it no
[42:46] matter what you're going to do you're
[42:48] not going to get it amen so when we give
[42:50] example here always remember our pastor
[42:54] is giving example boasting in the Lord
[42:57] not to project myself because we don't
[42:59] want nothing else to be put in the heart
[43:01] of the people but the word brother Bram
[43:05] say that Minister preacher begin to puts
[43:08] in the heart of the people and that's
[43:10] the reason why when they deviate the
[43:13] people stay with the minister instead of
[43:15] staying with the word amen we don't want
[43:19] that in this church in this church we
[43:22] give preeminence to the word if the
[43:25] pastor leave the word
[43:30] him amen there's no game to
[43:34] that heaven and earth will pass away but
[43:37] my
[43:38] word amen let every man's word be a lie
[43:43] but only the word of God will be the
[43:47] truth Amen period in this church period
[43:53] that's why we preach the message purely
[43:57] amen where brother Brandon put a comma
[44:00] we put a comma where brother Brandon put
[44:03] a stop we put a stop where brother Bram
[44:06] clear his throat we clear our
[44:08] thought
[44:10] [Applause]
[44:14] amen blessed be the name of the Lord
[44:17] hallelujah just be gracious with me on
[44:20] time let me preach amen how many receive
[44:25] a message from Living Word
[44:27] I did I did
[44:31] okay normally I don't pay attention to
[44:35] those kind of
[44:36] stuff brother Bram say Jesus walk UNC
[44:39] conscience of
[44:41] criticism but as a pastor a Shepherd I
[44:44] must say
[44:45] something amen and I'm talking to this
[44:49] church and to the people that are member
[44:52] of this church amen I didn't have any
[44:55] time to waste Amen to listen to those
[44:58] stuff because I know it's the same old
[45:01] version of the letter we gave in
[45:04] December amen you should have told the
[45:07] truth back then amen not wait up to now
[45:12] now for those who went and listen to
[45:14] those sermon those
[45:17] videos some of them report to me that
[45:20] there was a name of a minister here that
[45:23] was mentioned there that he brought a
[45:26] book to brother Tim and that was brother
[45:29] Kelly and I know it's the devil fighting
[45:32] back so I don't want to give time or
[45:35] room to the devil for people begin to
[45:38] question why did Brother Kelly give the
[45:40] book why did Brother Kelly give the book
[45:43] The Bible say when the first witness
[45:45] come they always give him reason but
[45:48] when the second come they question the
[45:50] first one amen so I'm going to give
[45:53] brother Kelly four or five minutes and
[45:56] let him tell you why he gave the book
[45:58] and if somebody ask you a question tell
[46:00] them to refer back to this amen and we
[46:04] clear that once for all brother Kelly
[46:07] come
[46:14] on there is a microphone up
[46:18] there amen you want to kill the devil
[46:21] that's how you kill the devil on Amen
[46:25] not the Lord go ahead brother I told
[46:28] y'all from the beginning I love whooping
[46:29] on the
[46:30] devil you see you can't trap the word
[46:35] let's go back and let's tell the whole
[46:38] truth now at the time when we were all
[46:41] there in one
[46:43] family you know I was a Watchman at one
[46:46] time you know when a deacon or someone
[46:48] is spiritual they watching a Watchman he
[46:51] watches before the enemy gets up on you
[46:54] that's
[46:55] right so when he came if something come
[46:59] to this church who would you go to
[47:04] First
[47:06] ah the enemy came and tried to come
[47:09] there living
[47:11] word brother Tim was my pastor at the
[47:16] time I came to brother Tim
[47:20] privately to show him what the enemy was
[47:24] coming
[47:25] with even the one who wrote the book my
[47:29] wife and I sat up under that Ministry
[47:32] for almost over 10 years or maybe even
[47:38] longer so you know what you were up
[47:41] against it's only like brother Steve
[47:43] said it was only by the grace of
[47:48] God so if you notice my wife and I knew
[47:52] nothing what was going on when it all
[47:55] happened and I didn't leave leave
[47:59] immediately and make sure he tell this
[48:01] my precious brother that's out there
[48:03] tell the whole
[48:06] truth I went to him
[48:09] privately and God is my witness and
[48:12] he'll SP you back I never read the
[48:19] book on the front of that book called
[48:22] plag
[48:23] rizing and I knew the Holy Ghost had
[48:26] show me it was a spirit on that
[48:31] book now when Josiah and them got
[48:34] something they took you straight to the
[48:36] priest is that
[48:38] right now so when you doing things the
[48:42] right
[48:43] way and when individuals I met with him
[48:46] three times
[48:48] privately y'all can challenge me and you
[48:51] go pull it up on the website I told him
[48:53] I said
[48:54] brother go pull up
[48:57] Jesus Christ Church of windsboro South
[49:02] Carolina now this is what the one that
[49:04] accuse I I didn't even look at it I
[49:07] believe he's a man of God I know he's a
[49:09] man of God God showed me he was a man of
[49:11] God when my pastor told me not to look
[49:12] at something I didn't look at it I could
[49:15] I didn't even know my name was out
[49:17] there so when we got there I said
[49:20] brother go you look at it I said
[49:22] everyone that spoke against this prophet
[49:28] I told him eyeball to
[49:31] eyeball sir sir when I met my pastor he
[49:35] tell you I said brother I like to talk
[49:38] to people face to
[49:42] face and when he got there I said
[49:44] brother you look on in and see what
[49:46] happened to
[49:47] him I said Jeff Williams Brian small you
[49:52] got hry Parks I said go in there and
[49:54] pull it up and you see what happened to
[49:55] the ones that smoke against this
[49:59] Prophet tell him didn't not I say that
[50:01] brother
[50:04] Tim and all the ones that's following
[50:10] him you know when you're accused and
[50:13] that's why I said one thing I wanted to
[50:15] say the last time when I was here I
[50:17] wanted to apologize brother John and
[50:19] different ones because maybe I come a
[50:21] little too little too strong I felt a
[50:23] little too strong when I said something
[50:24] about the uh songs and different songs
[50:27] was coming and and and God G me Grace to
[50:29] talk about that another time but when I
[50:32] went there and I told see even when I
[50:35] was in the
[50:36] world supervising people I one negative
[50:40] thing that my manager told him about
[50:43] me he said I was overprotective of the
[50:46] people that was underneath of
[50:49] me and I'd rather be
[50:53] overprotective than under prototec
[50:57] and when I met him I told him said
[51:01] brother you better be
[51:05] careful one of his dearest friends
[51:08] called me see this message is so true I
[51:12] knew I wasn't dealing with him I was
[51:14] dealing with the devil prophet of God
[51:17] said once they leave from this message a
[51:20] deceiving and a lying Spirit comes on
[51:22] them
[51:26] the Bible said we wrestle not against
[51:28] flesh and blood but against
[51:29] principalities and power and wickedness
[51:31] and rulers in high places I told him
[51:33] that I said brother you need to be
[51:36] careful and when he called me in the
[51:39] time and I told him I said brother even
[51:42] the brother in 1950 I said I could bring
[51:44] you the paperwork what happened to him
[51:46] when he called that old Baldhead man I
[51:47] said if he's still alive he's probably
[51:49] about a hundred years
[51:51] old I said look and see what happened
[51:54] when it came against this prophet
[51:57] and when the first lion Spirit came to
[51:59] me and some of the brothers that's
[52:01] sitting there they came and asked me
[52:04] well what do you think do you think he
[52:05] still believed the message I said I went
[52:07] to him myself he told me at the time yes
[52:11] that's all I can do I to my son that
[52:14] come up in there I pers I took
[52:16] persecution from him I took persecution
[52:18] from all of them but I looked at him and
[52:20] said
[52:21] Son the footsteps of the righteous is
[52:24] ordered of the Lord
[52:27] I said you may be
[52:29] right with my some of my children they
[52:31] may do such and such they may do such
[52:33] and such when my wife and I was raising
[52:36] them and I looked at my children and I
[52:37] would tell them but it's my decision
[52:40] that I have to make for that
[52:42] consequence I went to him a second
[52:45] time I'm tell I'm telling you these
[52:47] things because some wonder why I was
[52:49] still there he told me he believed
[52:51] Malachi 4 brother John I believed him
[52:58] I went to him a second
[53:00] time he told me believe I believed
[53:03] him Holy Spirit already told me he was
[53:06] lying told me he was lying the first
[53:07] time but he did not tell me to leave
[53:13] yet and when I went to him the third
[53:15] time tell the truth brother Tim I met
[53:19] him in the waffle
[53:21] house and he gave me scriptures I had
[53:24] not even talked to brother C
[53:26] the same messages that he gave brother
[53:29] Steve the scriptures that he tried to
[53:32] convince me why he left this message he
[53:35] was already here ministering on it to
[53:45] y'all God has ordained this one of his
[53:49] best friends came to me called
[53:53] me said but Tim said you said so and so
[53:58] look got quiet I said he
[54:00] dead he says you said this about
[54:04] me I said aren't you and brother Tim
[54:09] friends he said yeah I said why would I
[54:12] want to break up your
[54:14] friendship I never even mentioned to him
[54:18] why would I do
[54:19] that see it wasn't going to gain me
[54:23] anything I said brother isn't it kind of
[54:25] strange that my name came up just out
[54:28] but this the second time isn't it
[54:30] strange my name just came up out of the
[54:32] blue out of nowhere you ever thought
[54:33] about that
[54:38] why I'm talking about a dear close
[54:40] friend
[54:41] to and they called me back the next
[54:45] day and they said brother Kelly I'm
[54:48] sorry I believe you I said that's okay
[54:50] be honest with you me I'm a Warrior when
[54:53] that Holy Ghost get on me
[54:57] you know what I really said I can't care
[54:59] less if you believe it or not God knew
[55:02] it God knew it was the truth that's all
[55:05] that
[55:09] mattered nobody even knew it if anyone
[55:12] in my anyone in my heart that I felt
[55:15] that it could have helped this
[55:17] brother was brother
[55:20] to at the time he's my
[55:23] pastor and I wasn't going to do anything
[55:26] anything wrong a against the word of God
[55:29] against the people of
[55:31] God so that's how now you
[55:35] know he had an
[55:37] opportunity and the reason why my wife
[55:39] and I still we didn't even know what in
[55:41] the world was going
[55:43] on and then we finally found out the
[55:48] truth come to find out a person has not
[55:53] failed until they start to blame
[55:55] somebody
[56:01] and T I found out and I told
[56:05] him but Tim I love you but I'mma do my
[56:09] homework just like you did your
[56:13] homework I found out the things that it
[56:15] was true I found out I went way back see
[56:19] I always wonder brother John I always
[56:20] wanted to be a detective
[56:27] you see so when we come there and I went
[56:30] way
[56:31] back and I found
[56:33] out he had struggled with this message
[56:36] 10 years before that and I don't want to
[56:40] go there and so some of you know what
[56:42] I'm talking about visitors forgive me
[56:45] the pastor will explain those things but
[56:48] I didn't even know what was sent out
[56:50] Pastor said don't look at it I wasn't
[56:52] going to look at it these things is in
[56:54] my heart I was never never going to
[56:56] throw any darts at other I was never
[56:59] going to sing because see when Jesus and
[57:02] I'm I'mma Sit Down When Jesus came to
[57:06] Judas and he knew he was going to betray
[57:08] him he said my
[57:11] friend do what you're going to do
[57:13] quickly God bless you thank you thank
[57:17] you
[57:18] [Applause]
[57:24] amen like Bram say you have any question
[57:28] you need to go back and refer to this in
[57:31] other word he was under the ministry of
[57:33] brother Brian
[57:36] small that's where brother Kelly was and
[57:39] brother Brian small left the
[57:42] message and as one of his sheep in the
[57:45] past he was longing for somebody that
[57:48] could help brother Brian
[57:50] small so he took the book of brother
[57:53] Brian small and never read it and took
[57:55] it to brother Tim like brother Tim you
[57:58] the only one that I believe you can help
[58:01] that brother that was how brother Kelly
[58:04] handled the
[58:06] book brother Kelly never read the book
[58:09] so what I'm going to tell you don't
[58:12] start war on Facebook
[58:15] sir we're not here to entertain the
[58:18] devil that's right this is probably the
[58:20] last time I'm going to talk about this

[58:47] behind and looking forward to those that
[58:50] are
[58:51] before

[59:22] happened the Lord has been gracious to
[59:25] us the Lord taught you here several
[59:28] month but after teaching you must have a
[59:32] test amen that's why they send you a

[1:00:14] don't hear those stuff we don't have
[1:00:16] time for that it's homegoing time we're

[1:06:34] this banquet but Esther did not know
[1:06:37] whether she's going to have access to
[1:06:39] the king or not because the case was if
[1:06:42] the king doesn't stretch his golden
[1:06:45] scepter they're going to kill you so she
[1:06:47] was not even sure whether is going to

[1:17:32] Jesus Christ amen God bless you we are
[1:17:36] in King
[1:17:38] aaries three feast in Ester 2 banquet
[1:17:42] part seven somebody might be wondering
[1:17:45] why am I reading scripture scripture
[1:17:47] scripture scripture brother Bram say
[1:17:50] here he said knowing that you are my
[1:17:53] responsibility
[1:17:55] and on my hand for the gospel I shall
[1:17:59] always want to keep you right in the
[1:18:01] pages of this that's the reason why I
[1:18:05] give scripture the way I do give him the
[1:18:08] message is King is three feast and
[1:18:11] Esther's two
[1:18:12] banquet originally if you look in the
[1:18:15] Book of Esther there are seven
[1:18:18] Feast everybody following me the first
[1:18:21] Feast towards the Feast of King aerus
[1:18:24] which explain to you was the
[1:18:26] dispensation of the Old Testament the
[1:18:29] second Feast was the Feast of King aerus
[1:18:33] where he had a feast for seven days
[1:18:35] which were the seven Church ages the
[1:18:38] third Feast was still the Feast of King
[1:18:40] aerus but he was in the honor of Esther
[1:18:44] which will explain to you that he was
[1:18:46] the marriage supper but there is not a
[1:18:49] feast but it's hidden to understand that
[1:18:52] Feast you need a prophet we you know
[1:18:55] that in the Book of Esther Esther went
[1:18:57] and fasted for 3 Days everybody clear a
[1:19:02] fast in the body is a
[1:19:06] feast brother
[1:19:09] BR and I took this Bible and I just pull
[1:19:12] it open that like that and my thumb was
[1:19:15] laying at First Corinthian the fifth
[1:19:17] chapter the eth verse when something
[1:19:20] reads something like this when you come
[1:19:23] I was planning on taking a fast to the
[1:19:26] Lord I told him I would go out and fast
[1:19:29] said when you come to this Feast which a
[1:19:33] fast in the body is a feast with
[1:19:37] the and everybody clear so we know that
[1:19:41] so when you come to this Feast don't
[1:19:44] come with the old leav or the leav of
[1:19:47] malice and so forth but come with the
[1:19:49] unleavened bread of sincerity and Truth
[1:19:53] just exactly what he told me in the
[1:19:55] vision God is my solemn judge come with
[1:19:59] the unle bread of sincerity and truth
[1:20:01] that is the so a fast in the body is a
[1:20:06] feast amen when you are fasting you are
[1:20:09] actually feasting with the Lord but you
[1:20:12] must do your fasting in the
[1:20:16] word amen praise the name of the Lord so
[1:20:19] the fourth Feast that was hidden was the
[1:20:22] Feast of the fasting of ES
[1:20:26] everybody clear the fifth Feast was the
[1:20:29] first banquet of Esther the sixth one is
[1:20:32] the second banquet of Esther and the
[1:20:35] last one is the Feast of
[1:20:37] purum Amen which we have not talked
[1:20:40] about it yet everybody clear so now last
[1:20:44] Sunday we saw that when Hammon went to
[1:20:47] the king he accused the Jews when he
[1:20:50] accused the Jews he was handed the Seal
[1:20:53] of the king and and we find out that the
[1:20:55] same seal that unveil Christ also unveil
[1:20:59] the ministry of the Antichrist now
[1:21:02] brother bam said that we need to go back
[1:21:05] to the power of God something that can
[1:21:08] do the same thing today because
[1:21:11] everything was quiet in the Kingdom
[1:21:13] everybody was quiet everything was going
[1:21:15] fine but the lord gave permission to Hon
[1:21:19] to bring pressure upon the people why
[1:21:22] does God allow pressure in our life why
[1:21:26] does God bring trouble in our life
[1:21:29] brother Bram says persecution always
[1:21:33] give strength to the
[1:21:35] church we have had it too easy we get it
[1:21:39] slowful we get to a place where we don't
[1:21:42] want to move on because everything is
[1:21:45] just handed to us it takes sorrow and
[1:21:49] tears and sweat and prayer and faith and
[1:21:54] promise to move forward in the power of
[1:21:57] the holy spirit so without trouble
[1:22:00] Esther will not fast it took trouble to
[1:22:03] bring prayer and fasting into the life
[1:22:06] of Esther everybody clear that Zeal and
[1:22:11] power that they had in those day has
[1:22:13] longterm vanished from our assemblies
[1:22:17] I'm afraid if the windows would be shut
[1:22:19] out tonight people will run everywhere
[1:22:22] and never even come back in other word
[1:22:25] if something happen just a little news
[1:22:28] about Corona virus nobody want to come
[1:22:30] to church people begin to forget about
[1:22:33] the power of God they begin to forget
[1:22:36] about the protection of God I am the god
[1:22:40] that heals you from all your
[1:22:43] diseases amen praise the name of the
[1:22:46] Lord so let's go to eser chapter 3 now
[1:22:50] as we moving
[1:22:51] slowly blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:22:55] Esther chapter 3 that's where we were
[1:22:57] and then we're going to blend in quickly
[1:22:59] Esther 3:
[1:23:02] 10
[1:23:07] amen and then the king took his wing
[1:23:11] from his hand and gave it to hmon the
[1:23:14] son of hamadeta we saw it last week the
[1:23:17] agat the Jews enemy and the King said to
[1:23:21] himon the silver is given to you in
[1:23:23] other words don't want your money you
[1:23:25] can take it the people also take the
[1:23:28] people and do to them as it seems good
[1:23:31] to you just like God gave permission to
[1:23:34] the devil going to the house of job amen
[1:23:38] then where the king scrub call on the
[1:23:41] 13th day of the first month and there
[1:23:44] was written according to all that hon
[1:23:47] had what so when you look at this
[1:23:50] writing to the public it looks like it's
[1:23:54] the King who wrote the writing it looks
[1:23:57] like it is a declaration from the King
[1:24:01] because it is written in the Name of the
[1:24:03] King and it's also sealed with the Seal
[1:24:06] of the king so when it's read you will
[1:24:09] always see that oh my God the king is
[1:24:12] against us amen but actually the one who
[1:24:16] wrote that was hon but to the public it
[1:24:19] looks like it's the king am amen you
[1:24:23] might have a trou in your life and you
[1:24:25] think God is punishing you but it's not
[1:24:28] actually God punishing you it is the
[1:24:31] devil doing
[1:24:33] that
[1:24:35] amen jump to verse 13 and the letter was
[1:24:39] sent by post and into all the king's
[1:24:43] provinces to do what destroy to destroy
[1:24:47] praise the name of the Lord the first
[1:24:50] word is to destroy we are looking at the
[1:24:52] heart of Amon Amen to destroy K and to
[1:24:57] do what number two is to
[1:25:01] kill praise the name of the Lord
[1:25:04] everybody
[1:25:05] there and to kill and to cause to perish
[1:25:08] which is the same thing all Jews both
[1:25:12] who and who so the attack of hon doesn't
[1:25:18] have a n
[1:25:21] specification ammen attack everybody
[1:25:25] hon attacked the younger and the older
[1:25:28] one so nobody spared come on little what
[1:25:33] so that's why we need to bring the token
[1:25:35] in our
[1:25:36] home because the enemy is about the
[1:25:39] younger one he's against the other one
[1:25:42] he's against even little
[1:25:45] children little children and what sister
[1:25:49] you are not spare in one day even upon
[1:25:53] the 30 day of the 12 month which is the
[1:25:56] month Adam and to take the what of them
[1:26:01] for a so the enemy here is looking to
[1:26:05] destroy he want to kill and the third
[1:26:09] thing he want to
[1:26:10] steal the SPO for the people everybody
[1:26:14] clear so the heart of a man have a
[1:26:17] fulfillment of three things the first
[1:26:21] thing he want to destroy he want to kill
[1:26:24] and he want to steal everybody clear in
[1:26:28] the Book of John 10: 10 the Bible says
[1:26:32] that the fifth everybody
[1:26:36] clear cometh not but to do what number
[1:26:40] three
[1:26:41] checked everybody clear and to do what
[1:26:46] number two checked everybody clear and
[1:26:50] to do what number one checked yeah
[1:26:54] everybody clear and the thief cometh not
[1:26:57] B to steal and to kill and to destroy I
[1:27:02] am come that they might have life and
[1:27:06] that they might have it more abundantly
[1:27:09] amen now let's look at this fif
[1:27:13] clearly because now we understand that
[1:27:16] the heart of hon is nothing but the
[1:27:20] heart of the
[1:27:23] devil John 12:4 the Bible say then say
[1:27:28] one of his disciple
[1:27:30] who Jas is cariot which was the devil
[1:27:34] incarnated in flesh amen the son of
[1:27:38] predition Simon son which should betray
[1:27:41] him why was not this ointment sold for
[1:27:45] 300 p and given to the poor this he said
[1:27:50] not that he care for the poor but
[1:27:53] because he was a that's why Judah was
[1:27:57] the devil
[1:27:59] incarnated everybody clear Judah was a
[1:28:02] thief and had the begag and bear what
[1:28:05] was put in them brother Bram continues
[1:28:09] as we moving in the exposition of the
[1:28:12] church ages brother Bram says remember
[1:28:16] while Jesus was upon the Earth so was
[1:28:19] Judah each came from a different spirit
[1:28:23] and upon death each went to his own
[1:28:26] place the spirit of Christ L and came
[1:28:29] back upon the true church on the day of
[1:28:32] Pentecost everybody clear and the spirit
[1:28:36] of
[1:28:37] who a fif Spirit came back upon the
[1:28:42] first so when Heaven poor hell also poor
[1:28:46] everybody clear it is right there in
[1:28:50] Revelation which is the seals every here
[1:28:55] brother Bram jum down see how that Judah
[1:28:59] Spirit came back as a rer on the
[1:29:03] what everybody clear everybody clear on
[1:29:07] a white horse he was white so close to
[1:29:11] the whe just as Judah was so close to
[1:29:14] who and as talking as the horse rider we
[1:29:18] know that we have three horse rider the
[1:29:21] first one was a white horse rider
[1:29:24] everybody should be familiar in this
[1:29:26] church the second one was a red horse
[1:29:29] rider which was the devil killing the
[1:29:32] people amen and the third one was the
[1:29:35] black horse
[1:29:36] rider which was the devil playing with
[1:29:39] the staff of life and selling them a
[1:29:42] measure of penny for B and two measure
[1:29:45] of wheight for a p you know that already
[1:29:48] he was destroying the staff of life amen
[1:29:52] but the was another hor which was a Pale
[1:29:55] Horse rid everybody clear brother Bram
[1:29:58] says that the Pale Horse is actually a
[1:30:02] mixture of all the three because to have
[1:30:06] the pale color you need to have the
[1:30:08] white color plus the red color plus the
[1:30:13] black color everybody clear but we know
[1:30:16] that Judah was a thief and a thief what
[1:30:20] he does he still and brother Bram said
[1:30:23] that Judah was the white hor Rider in
[1:30:26] other word the white rer was what
[1:30:29] stealing amen you have destroy kill and
[1:30:32] steal and you have destroy kill and
[1:30:35] steal amen so when Jesus was talking
[1:30:39] about the enemy comes to kill to destroy
[1:30:42] and and to and to and to steal Jesus was
[1:30:47] talking to you about the Pale Horse rid
[1:30:50] which his name was what that's the
[1:30:54] reason why the devil his name is what so
[1:30:57] when Jesus said the enemy comes to kill
[1:31:00] he comes to destroy he come to seal
[1:31:03] Jesus was putting the three seals
[1:31:05] together and telling you that the devil
[1:31:08] his name is death and his purpose is
[1:31:12] always to destroy to kill and to steal
[1:31:16] everybody clear and we find that in the
[1:31:18] Book of Esther here that the purpose of
[1:31:21] Amon was to destroy to kill and to steal
[1:31:26] in other word at this stage of Ammon
[1:31:28] Amon was riding the pale horse
[1:31:33] rider are we clear
[1:31:36] together are we clear together did we
[1:31:39] lose anyone praise the name of the Lord
[1:31:43] amen we're dealing with the pale hor R
[1:31:46] now let's go to Esther chapter
[1:31:48] 4 praise the name of the Lord
[1:31:51] [Music]
[1:31:54] to decode this you need a
[1:31:59] prophet
[1:32:01] amen now nobody knows
[1:32:04] this the announcement went to the entire
[1:32:07] Kingdom everybody saying the king is
[1:32:10] going to kill the Jews the king is going
[1:32:12] to kill the Jews the king is going to
[1:32:14] kill the Jews who's killing the Jews the
[1:32:17] king who's killing the Jews the king
[1:32:20] there was only one person that have the
[1:32:23] re
[1:32:24] of the P
[1:32:27] house everybody
[1:32:29] clear let's go to Esther chapter 4 verse
[1:32:33] one when
[1:32:35] who did
[1:32:37] what all that was what because the
[1:32:41] fourth still belong to
[1:32:45] Mori it takes the eager prophetic
[1:32:49] anointing to detect heron
[1:32:53] [Applause]
[1:32:56] amen when mon perceive all that was done
[1:33:02] M did what rent his clothes and put on S
[1:33:07] cloth with ashes and went out into the
[1:33:10] midst of the city and cry with a loud
[1:33:12] voice of cry with a loud voice and a bit
[1:33:16] cry instead of Mora staying in his home
[1:33:20] and begin to M and weep they can't went
[1:33:25] publicly because a prophet is always a
[1:33:28] son to the
[1:33:30] public everybody clear and mon begin to
[1:33:36] cry you say brother was crying brother
[1:33:42] St in the
[1:33:45] message do
[1:33:49] what brother Bram said the word of the
[1:33:52] Lord is so great
[1:33:54] so good there just no way to stop
[1:33:58] reading it it just becomes Life as we
[1:34:02] read it like in this church I think in
[1:34:06] this text this morning though it's being
[1:34:09] taped I want to say this in the
[1:34:12] beginning I found if found I found who
[1:34:16] myself so brother Bram want to preach
[1:34:19] the message why cry and do what and
[1:34:22] brother Bram by meditating in the
[1:34:25] message he found out that that message
[1:34:28] was talking about his attitude
[1:34:31] [Music]
[1:34:33] himself amen and the reason that
[1:34:37] yesterday while in study and I come upon
[1:34:40] this subject why CHR I speak and then I
[1:34:43] thought I am just going if the Lord
[1:34:46] willing to speak upon that because he
[1:34:49] dve me what he be to condemn brother
[1:34:53] Bram himself
[1:34:54] because mon was
[1:34:58] crying and I hope he dve us all
[1:35:03] including brother Bram that we must see
[1:35:06] and cause us to look up and to study a
[1:35:09] little bit in comparing the day that was
[1:35:12] then unto the day that is what so it is
[1:35:16] a human tendency when Trouble Comes we
[1:35:20] have a tendency to weep we have a
[1:35:23] tendency to cry we have a tendency to
[1:35:25] complain we have a tendency to lament
[1:35:28] and brother Bram himself as human being
[1:35:31] found himself down that's the reason why
[1:35:34] when the news came mon himself was
[1:35:39] crying everybody
[1:35:41] clear let's jump down to verse two and
[1:35:45] came even before the
[1:35:47] what now he came before The King's gate

[1:50:47] Jews and fasting and weeping and Welling
[1:50:50] and many lay in sacl and Ashes they
[1:50:53] can't get in the presence of the king so
[1:50:56] Esther's maid and her Chamberlain came
[1:51:00] and told it to Esther then was the king
[1:51:04] exceedingly grieved so when they told
[1:51:07] her they say we saw moreai over there
