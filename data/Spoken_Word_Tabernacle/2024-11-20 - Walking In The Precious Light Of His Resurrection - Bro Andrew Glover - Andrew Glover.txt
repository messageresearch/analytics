we'll be sure to give thee all the praise all the honor and all the glory in the wonderful name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ we pray and all the Believers says amen amen and amen the book of First Corinthians God bless you 1 Corinthians chapter 15 and we want to look there in verse number one and then we're going to go to the Book of Luke 24 and also St John chapter 14 also want to bring you greetings tonight from my wife Mariah and the family there at home I was telling brother Steven Lord willing the next time we're out this way to see you all they'll be with us amen amen 1 Corinthians chapter 15 and verse number one Paul here writing he says moreover Brethren I declare unto you the gospel which I preached unto you which also ye have received and wherein ye stand by which also ye are saved if you keep in memory what I preached unto you unless ye have believed in vain for I delivered unto you first of all that which I also received how that Christ died for our sins according to the scriptures now watch and that he was buried and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures do you realize that Jesus Christ could have raised himself at any moment when they put him in the grave but prophetic word held him there for 3 days because he must die he must be buried and he must rise according to the scripture amen now in St Luke chapter 24 St Luke chap 24 and verse number 32 amen St Luke chapter 24 amen this is a very very familiar reading to the Believers brother Bram uses this many times in messages like when their eyes were open they knew him in St lukee chapter 24 and let's begin reading there at the 31st verse you love the Lord tonight the Bible says and their eyes were opened and they knew him and he vanished out of their sight amen yes sir their eyes were opened and they knew him and he vanished out of their sight and they said one to another did not our heart heart burn within us while he talked with us by the way now watch this and while he opened to us the scripture he has just raised from the dead according to the scripture and now he's walking with the two on the mayest road opening the scripture to them in St John chapter 14 St John chapter 14 I I know you believe this that the Bible speaks of the bridegroom right amen I believe I believe that the same Bible that speaks of the bridegroom also speaks of the Bride in St John chap 14 and verse 19 Jesus says yet a little while and the world seeth me no more but ye see me now watch this uhhuh because I live amen ye shall live also amen we ask the Lord this evening to add the blessing to the reading of his word as you can have your seats here this afternoon I want to by the help of the Lord from those passages of scripture tonight if I would take a title I want to talk to you on this thought for a few moments on walking in the precious light of his resurrection am walking in the precious light of his resurrection to maybe lay a foundation here brother B speaking 1958 and I know my redeemer liveth very powerful sermon he said dear God we are grateful this morning to be the people that is called by thy name we are so glad that we do not have to just imagine anymore of a great resur resurrection that is to come now I want you to catch this we are so glad that we do not just have to imagine any more of a great resurrection that is to come see because it's become a reality to us as we read it in the word I think that's very powerful that the the resurrection is no longer something that's in the future or a ways out there but as we are reading the word of God the resurrection is becoming a reality to us he said and to see that thou has promised this and we feel it within our souls That Jesus Lives he said we are thinking this morning the many heartaches that's been in life the many sadnesses that we went through he said the experiences that is toring us and throwing us to The Winds of the Earth how we have buried our loved ones and we've mourned at the grave he said and our soul seems to almost perish within us amen but then we can think of today now think about that did not say we can think of 2,000 years ago he said but we can think of today oh what it means amen that Jesus has raised from the dead he has spoiled every Power of the enemy when he rose up triumphant he took all the Shadows away he said and now we walk in the precious light of his resurrection in other words we are not waiting for the morning of the Resurrection to begin walking Amen in the light of his resurrection but there is a bride on the Earth today who by the message of the hour amen is already walking in the Blessed light of his resurrection brother speaking of job he said I know my redeemer liveth and at the last day he will stand up on the earth or after the skin worms amen destroy this body yet in my flesh amen shall I see God he said he seen the resurrection would be brought about by a man someday that's right and the sin question would be settled when that righteous one the Son of God Amen came to die for Sinners there was no man on the earth at that time or no man sense that could ever Bridge the way between a holy God and a sinful man amen but job here 4,000 years amen before his coming saw his death his burial and his resurrection amen and his justification that come amen by the resurrection now watch he didn't not just see the coming of the Lord Jesus amen the Redeemer resurrected but brother said and he also seen the absolute guarantee of the resurrection of the believer amen so joob was not just seeing the Lamb amen but he was seen the effect of what the lamb was doing amen that would also affect the Lamb's wife he said what a comfort it is to know amen that these things are true amen and it's not a fiction story I want you to say to you tonight the gospel amen is not a man it's not a church it's not a denomination amen but the gospel is the birth and the life and the death and the burial and the resurrection of Jesus Christ let me say it like Paul said he said I am so surprised amen that you would be turned to another gospel he said which there is no other amen but a make belief gospel to a denominational fiction he said she turning from that good news amen but Jesus said because I live amen ye live also he said and I live in you and the works that I do amen I do will identify myself in you he said what a message no wonder we've had a dark world of theology amen but in the evening time amen there shall come light again listen there was light in the morning time amen but according to brother Brandon amen there was to be lighted again in the evening time amen see listen he says there will be a resurrection in the evening time my goodness there was a resurrection in the morning time but there was prophesy to be a resurrection in the evening time he said it shall be light at the evening time listen because I live ye live also but stops and it is the rise of the sun he says now amen he was speaking to his wife because I live ye live also now listen to this quote what a resurrection that that was amen but what a resurrection this is to be quickened from the dead to be made alive in Christ Jesus by God's quickening power he was waved to them the word which he was was wave back to them on the day of Pentecost amen the word made manifest now and as I say it is to be waved again in the last day listen the same light that brought a resurrection in the morning time is prophesied to return in the evening time and to bring a resurrection in the evening time let me say that is coming from the word of God and the word of God is not a fiction amen the word of God is true because it Bears results amen that proves it is the truth he said this is the Bible it's God's truth it's his promise amen I have tried it and tested it and I know you can take God's word and he will make it right with you amen he will bring it to pass now we know by a prophet's teaching amen that there is to come an absolute to this generation say it is perfect in itself it is Unlimited in its power it is primarily in Ultimate see it's Unlimited in its power it is perfect in itself listen and it really is an ultimate said therefore I think everybody amen should have an ultimate every great achievement that's ever been achieved amen there has been an absolute behind it listen you cannot go through life amen without having an absolute listen you've got to be tied to something amen you can't be tied to anything you've got to be tied to something but make sure whatever you're tied to is tied itself are you hearing me make sure whatever you are tied to is also tied off itself listen you can be tied off to something but if it is not anchored then if it moves you're going to move with it amen but if you are tied to something that is anchored amen the winds can blow and the rains can fall and the storms can gather but there is an absolute in your soul because there's an absolute behind what your tithe to listen I am not tied to a church I am not tied to a preacher I am not tied to a denomination I am tied to the message of the hour listen I can trace my absolute all the way back to the throne of God listen this message is settled in heaven it is settled upon the Earth and it is settled in my heart and there ain't no Devils amen that can defeat this bride in her victory over the devil in this age we're living in [Applause] it's more than a message it's more than a book it's more than a tape it is an absolute guarantee now when you look at this word guarantee amen the word guarantee it is a formal promise or Assurance amen that is typically in writing so when you have a guarantee it's not just a handshake it's not just a good word amen it is something that has been put in right amen that certain conditions will be fulfilled listen it is something amen that gives a certainty of an outcome so when you have a guarantee listen you can't change it in the middle of the day are you hearing me if you have a guarantee amen that's why you have a contract amen if you're going to build a house you get a contract amen so halfway through the job amen they can't change the price on you they can't change the way things are done because it's been settled in writing let me say this the only absolute guarantee that I know of Amen is the revealed word of God that has been brought to us through the seventh Angels message listen this message was written in the Bible but it was preached amen by a living voice and was recorded on 1,200 books and tapes can I say this to you you've come too late to change us see amen that's why we don't believe everything that's why we don't swallow every doctrine that comes by because we got our own books and tapes we can go read for ourself what the prophet has said about the subject and we can discern what is truth and what is error listen church if there's ever been a time to get back in the books and to get back in the tapes amen now is the time to do it preachers teaching all kinds of things churches are going every direction men are interpreting can I just preach amen it's got to where now amen we can't even read Quotes no more we got to reward them and we got to paraphrase them we got to figure out a better way to say them listen I refuse Amen to change the written guarantee that has coming this generation listen if you want to go to hell change the message if you want to go to tribulation change the message but ask for me and my house we're going to stand on what a prophet Tau every dotted eye every cross tea we're going to stand on the message of the [Applause] hour hallelujah it's more than just a book it's more than just a tape amen but now that guarantee has moved into flesh well I might as well say it you can't change this Bible you can't change the books and tapes and neither can you change me you can't change the Bible you can't change the message and you can't change me because what's in the Bible and what's on the books and what's on the tapes is in my flesh by the baptism of the Holy Ghost you can't change me I know who I am I know where I come from I know where I'm standing I'm standing on an AB salute Hallelujah ye are written Epistles amen written not with ink amen but with the spirit of the Living God it is not in tables of stone but in the fleshly tables of the heart Paul goes on to sayen for this is the Covenant that I will make with the house of Israel after those days sayith the Lord amen I will put my laws I will put my laws into their mind and I will write them in their hearts somebody say well I think we need to stream brother so and so I think we need to follow brother so and so I think we need to go back to listen to tapes come on Church a amen can I preach amen y'all remember when he used to hear something preach a little different right and you went to somebody and you said hey Heen where did Brother B teach at that's because you were listening to the tapes and you had the ability to determine what was certain and uncertain but then you start listening to brother so and so amen and he teaches it different than brother Brandon listen I am not going to be corrected amen by the way brother so and so teach you something I have been called to follow the message of the hour therefore amen as you are listening to them books you are listening to them tapes amen God is writing his law into your mind and upon your heart said listen amen and and Paul says and I will be to them a God and they shall be to me a people 1956 brother says therefore the man's spirit is Blended out amen and God comes in and takes over he said then they got Fellowship one with another and the Very God that created the heavens and the Earth amen that wrote his word amen dwells in you and you believe everything that God wrote is the truth and you will accept it you will believe it and hold on to it and you'll have Fellowship see the Bible is the scripture amen that has been given by inspiration of God it is profitable for Doctrine amen for Repro for correction listen and for instruction in righteousness we've tried to tell you that the Bible amen is the word of God Amen it is wrote by God himself listen now through the lips and instrumentality of man listen God can write himself amen God can speak himself God can do what he wants to amen but he chose man to do it listen because the man that wrote it is a part of God so God wrote the Bible he said the men didn't even know what they were writing in their own human thinking listen they might disagree with it but they wrote it anyhow come on Church they might have disagreed with it but they wrote it anyhow listen because men of old were moved amen by the Holy Ghost In other words they were writing out prophecy amen of the coming Messiah which was not other than our Lord Jesus Christ now in St John chap 5 and verse 46 I love what the Bible says Jesus is standing there and he said now listen for had you believed Moses amen you would have believed me now watch what Jesus says for he wrote Of Me amen Jesus stands there and says if you believe me you would believe Moses or believe Moses believe me because Moses wrote of me look at this word wrote it means to describe it means to commit to writing listen things not to be forgotten it means to record it is used of those things which stand amen written in the sacred books of the Old Testament amen by writing an epistle it is to give information to give direction listen to make so clear that it's not missed when it comes into manifestation so Moses did not just speak of him but Moses wrote of him and Jesus stands there now watch what he doesn't do he does not dismiss Moses's writings he said if ye believe not his writings amen then how shall you believe my words are you with me now see Jesus was the manifestation of the words the baby born down there an illegitimate birth in a cow stable how could that be this guy didn't go to any school he had no credentials he had no Fellowship card he didn't belong in an organization they didn't even know what school he went to amen how could this be anything amen but it was see they failed to see but but Jesus stood there and he said is this okay he said the works I do amen they testify of me he said search the scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life amen but they are they that testify amen they tell you who I am I love what brother says he said Jesus looked at him and said the scriptures are my testimony the scriptures were the testimony of Jesus Christ if you don't believe me believe the works I do they tell you who I am and they said well we believe Moses amen We Believe Moses but he said if you believe Moses you would believe me because he wrote of me now listen at the prophet's words he says they were so dark amen they were so dark he didn't say it was so dark he said they was so dark and still they couldn't see it he said I wonder if that couldn't repeat amen it's prophesied to you know it was prophesied to there you say in this day brother said oh yes because listen Jesus was all the inspired prophets testimonies all their prophecy was brought to light in his age that had been prophesied for his age I love this he lit up every candle of word that was in the Bible that was prophesied of him listen in other words y'all know what a candle is amen a candle is useless without a fire amen you can have a candle amen but unless fire comes upon it it'll give no light unless fire comes upon it it will release no kind of an aroma but if the fire ever strikes the wick it's going to give light and it's going to release a fragrance listen amen the Bible amen was the candle and Jesus was the fire the Bible said that a virgin shall conceive and Jesus struck that prophecy and she did the Bible said his name shall be called The Counselor the Prince of Peace the Mighty God the Everlasting father and he was I love this and the eyes of the blind shall see and they did everything that was prophesied of him amen it happened when he come on the earth when Jesus came on the earth he came bearing record or coming as the Fulfillment of the writings of Moses but said listen now we than thee to be the lightbearers of this age so Jesus was the lightbearer in his age but to be here now we are bearing the light in our age to manifest the promised word amen for the age that we're now living in knowing that at the beginning you allotted out your word amen can I just take time and read this he said knowing the end from the beginning each age you allotted your word to that age somehow we don't know how it ever happened but in each one of those ages as we look back upon Thy word we see there was an anointing that come in that age and that fulfilled the word so without the anointing there is no ability to fulfill the word but if the anointing comes Isaiah said the Yoke shall be destroyed because of the anointing when the anointing comes it destroys the Yoke and releases you to feel the word that is spoken over your life listen and in the day that we're now living in there is an alloted word there is an allotted word it is a promise for this age and we believe the holy spirit is here on the earth now and he's trying to find Hearts to manifest and bring to pass by vindicating the word that is now prophesied for this day and this hour listen the scripture cannot be broken it must be fulfilled Jesus said heavens and earth shall pass away amen but my words amen they shall never pass away said God's word is so real he said that's enough scripture right there to take all the communism out of the world and to convert the entire world it is an invitation to Salvation it is an invitation to Healing listen the guarantee of eternal life oh it mean now listen to me it means so much if it be received in the light that it's wrote in listen the word means so much if it be received in the light that it was wrote in let me say this eternal life is more than a cliche it is more than some idea of our imagination but eternal life to the believer is a written Divine promise of almighty God therefore I can announce to the devil tonight that we are not not here as educated Christians we are not here as theologians we are here as possessors of the greatest Revelation listen I can testify tonight I have Revelation in my soul I have eternal life well the devil didn't give it and the devil can't take it I know who gave it to me I know where I got it I got it from God I have come from God and I must go back to God Hallelujah brother said we're thankful we are thankful in the first seal he says we are thankful to be alive how many's thankful to be alive and to have this great revelation of eternal life dwelling within us listen these great Hidden Mysteries that's been hid since the foundation of the world and the lamb is the only one that can reveal it to us listen I pray he will come among us tonight and will take of his word and reveal it to us that we might know how to be better servants to him in this end time so the Revelation that was contained underneath those Seven Seals was going to release a character in The Bride of Jesus Christ to know how to better serve the Lord in the age that we're living in listen the Bible has become come a new book the Bible is not a man's book it is a prophetic book and this Bible is full of promises can I say this or written guarantees there are things that are wrote in this Bible that are written guarantees to you come on now there's certain conditions that must be fulfilled and there will be a manifestation my Bible says that you can believe for yourself and you can also for your house that is more than a scripture that is more than a good idea that is an absolute guarantee to this generation we have been called according to the revelation of the hour that we're living in oh Church of the Living God I think of all the promises all the promises in the Bible but tonight amen tonight amen I want to speak on one for a few moments that I'm very thankful for I am thank ful for the promise of light in Zechariah 14 it shall come to pass in that day that the light shall not be clear nor dark but it shall be one day which shall be known to the Lord not day or night but it shall come to pass listen so this is prophecy it shall come to pass that at the evening time it shall be light listen there will be a resurrection in the evening time said the evening light promised by the prophet of God in Zechariah 14:7 he said May again open the true believer's eyes to the events that's taking place today that is proved by the prophecies that we at the end time Jesus is coming modern events made clear by prophecy but the prophet said it shall be light again about the evening time the S oom the sun will peep out again it shall be light what the same son s o n that was revealed in the flesh in the morning time back there will be revealed again at the evening time oh Church of the Living God listen the only thing that changes is the flesh that the sun is revealed in in the morning time it was revealed in the flesh of Jesus Christ but in the evening time there would be a redemp message underneath Seven Seals that would be released and there would be Redemptive claims and the lamb would come forward and take his inheritance and claim your flesh for the evening time Resurrection oh Satan can you hear me we are not a bunch of church members we are a prophetic class of people hallelujah we have stepped from the pages of the word of God hallelujah you say what is this evening light this evening light is Revealing Light come on the evening light is Revealing Light in other words this is prophetic light in Isaiah chapter 60 and verse one I love my Bible don't you he says arise and shine arise and shine for thy light is come and the glory of the Lord is risen upon me come on church this is more than Church light this is more than denominational light this is more than Cosmic light this is more than man-made artificial light this is original prophetic light that is returning to the race of humanity to call for a resurrection Hallelujah [Applause] have you ever just slowed down and read Isaiah 60: 1 through3 look at verse two for Behold The Darkness it shall cover the earth and the gross Darkness the people so there's going to be a Darkness upon the Earth but there's going to be a heavier Darkness on the people but the Lord shall arise upon thee and His glory shall be seen upon thee now watch a prophet of God reads Isaiah 60 and brother Kelly right there in the middle of that age he says now good morning or Shalom darkness is gathering church he said but what is it gathering for it's Gathering to show the light listen now watch verse three Isaiah 60:3 and the Bible said and the Gentiles the Gentiles shall come to thy light listen this is a claiming light this is a this is a powerful light come on Church it doesn't say this light shall come to you but the Gentiles shall come to this light now amen I hate to I hate to just just stop here and say something but I'm going to say it okay amen amen we got people in this day and time and they get into all kinds of DNA and they get all kinds of spitting into a cup and send their DNA off hey if you're into that God bless you I ain't got no problem with it amen but what happens is they get to study a little bit and they find out somewhere they got about 1 percentage of a percentage of a percentage of Jewish blood in them and now all of a sudden they're Moses and Elijah I mean they're going to they're they're they're one of the they're one of the prophets because they found a little bit of Israelite blood well let me just say this we're all Gentiles come on I hate to bust your bubble but we're Gentiles and the Gentiles were not a people but because of this light God said I will write my laws in their heart I will place them in their mind and I will call them from the darkness of the earth I will call them from the gross darknesses upon the [Applause] people Church a living God you say preacher you happy to be a gentile I am tonight I am tonight to know I was out outside of the Covenant I was outside of the Commonwealth I was outside of the household of faith but Jesus Christ who is rich in Mercy by the atoning blood he sent a word and it was a Reconciliation word and it reconciled me back to [Applause] God the Gentiles shall come to thy light B said the last days through his son Jesus Christ Jesus Christ came on the earth and he testified he said I am the light of the world he that followeth me look here shall not walk in darkness but shall have the light of life now you all know without light you cannot have life and the prophet of God said no one could deny that Israel had light they were the only people who had light as a nation it was when Egypt was so dark that one could feel it but in the homes of the Israelites in the homes of the Israelites amen there was light he said now listen but now True light has come and the True Light is the world the light of the world is Jesus he said now Moses and the prophets brought the light by the means of the scripture that were relative to the Messiah thus Israel had light amen but now now the Fulfillment of the light has come and what was but a glowing word has now broken forth into the brightness of God manifested among his people as the pillar of fire gave light at night that was wonderful amen but now light and life were manifested in the fullness of the godhead bodily can I say this the light of life is shining and this Bible and his word in the hour that we live is shining upon those to catch the eternal life those who are predestinated to see it it won't do a bit of good upon the rest of them because there is no life in there to come forth by the True Light oh may I say to you tonight this light has brought a resurrection in Matthew 4: 16 the people with I know I'm reading a lot but stay with me the the people which sat in darkness saw great light and to them which sat in the region and the shadow of death amen light is sprung up now now that is not just something Jesus came up with that's a prophecy from Isaiah 9 and2 it says the people that walked in darkness have seen a great light can I read the rest of it and they that dwell in the land of the shadow of death right listen we are dwelling in a land that the shadow of death is covering everything it's covering our schools it's covering our churches it's covering our politics listen darkness is covering everything it's underneath the shadow of death but upon them Hallelujah upon them has the light shine listen you're working with people who's under the shadow of death you're going to school with people who are under the shadow of death you're rubbing shoulders every day with people who are under the spirit of destruction because they are living under the shadow of death but unto you Gentiles God said I I will bring a light Hallelujah we were possessed and we were condemned by God and their Idols he said but today the light of God is the word of God made manifest that's the light made manifest listen David said y though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death he said I will fear no evil for thou art with me thy rod and thy staff amen they comfort me where said many times we say oh Through The Dark Shadow or the Valley of the Dark Shadow he said in other words it's not there he said it's the Valley of the shadow of death if it's got a shadow there there has to be a certain percent of light Hallelujah come on church do you know what happens when you walk in Walmart you bring light into the shadow of death do you know what happens when you walk into your school you bring light into the shadow of death listen oh God it's covered in death but when you walk in there as a lightbearer of the word of God under the anointing you are bring in a percentage of light Hallelujah he said there is a man here who can turn on the light those who sat in the regions of the shadow of death some of them under cancer under death of denomination under Creed death under traditional death all kinds of death but they have seen a great light and the man that flashed the light then is the same one who said in the beginning let there be light he's the same yesterday today and forever listen and he is here present now don't get scared he can turn on the light what is the Su n I'm going somewhere the Su is the king of all lights when the word of God Rises all superstitions and denominations and fanaticisms and things they spread away and it just shows exactly what it is the word of God made manifest it always separates the light from the darkness I love this word he said his word is superior over all man's words over anything his word is light what are you saying preacher I'm saying Darkness and Light will not mix because light is so much more powerful that it just puts amen the darkness out let me just say this to you Leo ofia is dark politics are dark education is dark religious systems are dark come on the economy is dark come on Church the entire world is dark but listen to prophetic instruction don't you sit in darkness no more the light has come now that ought to be a challenge to every one of you Amen to get up out from under the shadow of depression get out from under the shadow of Hollywood get out from under the shadow of Leonia listen he said the light has come and the great conqueror is here what is this evening light it is the manifestation amen of the Resurrection when they didn't know he had raised from the dead although they loved him they believed him but they didn't know he raised from the dead they argued against it now here it is in the evening time he's going to reveal himself that he is raised from the dead come on Church my God is not in a tomb in Jerusalem he is not in a grave in Jeffersonville he is right here tonight in the power of His Resurrection come on the same one that went to Abraham and Sarah's tent it's the same one amen that went by the woman at the well it's the same son of man who Stood Beside a Prophet come on church it's time to get out of Darkness it's time to get out of Darkness I know we've gotten comfortable in darkness but you're a gentile and your light has come what are you saying I'm saying he's here in the power of his resurrection somebody say well amen I don't know if this message is the truth but you know you know what I say I say find me another Ministry with about 1,200 recorded sermons with over 8,000 discernments that not a one of them missed not a one of them missed not a one of them missed oh God not a one of them you say preacher why are you saying this amen because it seems amen that some people are going backwards amen looking for another Messiah sign I am not looking for a che carnal impersonation of the Messiah sign when I have seen the light of his resurrection in the beauty of the power of [Applause] reality come on you want me you want me prove it to you but the other day I heard him on tape he said now to prove to you that he is here I'm going to turn my back to this congregation you know what he says he says you sitting there he said oh I see what's wrong with you it's a stomach trouble oh I see what it is you're bleeding in your stomach oh that's it I see the blood is flowing in your stomach do you believe do you believe they said yes remember said oh I just saw it the blood just stopped come on church it was more than a man it was more than a preacher it was the resurrection of Jesus Christ the s yesterday Hallelujah it was Malachi 4 it was Luke 1730 it was Revelations 5 Revelations 10 what is it it's the pillar of fire has come among the church what are you saying I'm saying God is light my God is light you say what is that light it's the pillar of fire he said they wrote the Bible everyone back in those days but when Moses come on the scene he had the revelation of the word because he metant the pillar of fire well the disciples they just wrote what they seen him do amen but listen think of it the same Pillar of Fire are y'all with me the same Pillar of Fire that came upon those men amen that wrote the Bible is the same Pillar of Fire here today in interpreting the Bible notice the same P of fire that was sent to Moses and to Paul that wrote the Bible is now sent to reveal it oh Church the grace of God it's the unchanging God who is fulfilling his promise this same pitar of fire has come to what to manifest to make known to the people the promises that he's made for this day listen the darkness is darkened come on church amen I just go ahead and say it the darkness is darkened they can't see their way out come on why are they tapping into artificial intelligence right now why are they breaking in the artificial intelligence because they see no hope of the Future come on they see no hope of the future all they see is the end of the world come on church but God sent

you had taken a couple pieces of equipment out there and turned a bunch of kids loose I mean they pushed dirt this way pushed dirt that way they push so much dirt out of one side of that uh property the house was about to fall and I never forget that guy he looked over my grandfa father and he said fix this mess fix this mess I never forget it my grandfather looked back at him and said I didn't make it don't ask me to fix a mess I didn't make come on church are you hearing me are you hearing me in other words if you made the mess clean it up come on come that's like somebody buying a brand new pickup truck and they got a $80,000 pickup truck and they got a $1,200 month payment and about two months into the deal they come repossess the truck and you get mad at me cuz they took your truck why are you mad at me I didn't sign the papers come on chur are you hearing me listen that's why I'm not mad at the message people say well you got this issue and you you had this oh well we might as well preach it's out there amen well well you had you had this you oh God can I just get it out there and say it amen it's in the news I might as well say it they say well you had the trailer park issue the message didn't make that mess come on Church the message didn't make that well you got guys buying airplanes for brother Brandon to come back and ride on brother BR didn't make that mess come on Church they say well amen amen you got all these money scandals and all am the message didn't make the mess Let the person who made the mess clean the mess up and leave the message out of it come on Church the message didn't make that mess the devil made that mess and Men Who interpreted the message to make it oh God to make it come their own devilish hands they made that mess but I stand here tonight upon the infallibility of the absolute guarantee and I say the message of the hour did not make that mess the devil made that mess but I was born in sin I was shaping iniquity I was born a mess but Jesus Christ came by my way in the form of the message of the Hour come on Church well I know it might get tight there but let's just preach a second infidels will rise and Creeds will rise now y'all know what I'm talking about and I'm I'm I'm probably waiting out in some deep water right now infidels will rise Creeds will rise formalisms will rise Devils will rise but the light will remain the [Applause] same come on Church remember brother they had that great storm out there and he said all them birds were laying dead he said why he said instead of using the light to carry them to safety they use the light to fight against it they beat their brains out and they're laying there dead in other words he said the storms will come amen but don't only thing you got to do is walk in the light come on church this message is light I'm sorry I can't help what Devil's done with it but as for me in my house this message is the Vindicated light of the hour [Applause] that we're living in let me just say this before you can walk in the light amen you got to step in the light you know what the pro of God said well he said in the light of the angel of God Moses stand there on the mount that day everything he once had or thought would never happen it come to be a reality now I'm I'm just going to just going to get it out there that's it the message Ain respond responsible for this nonsense it's kind of like some oh God it's kind of like somebody runs off on a tangent preaching preaching crazy things about the bride age and then all of a sudden I'm supposed to stop preaching because of what somebody done with it are you crazy are you crazy I'm supposed to lay the light down and sit in darkness in a leyan age because some crazy man did something come on church I tell you what it's time to do it's time to get up it's time remember who you are and put your walking shoes on and start walking in the message of the hour again he said I think if a man woman today would ever step in the light of the Holy Spirit under the unction of God's word everything that God promised will illuminate to you and be real again oh mercy when word when God's word promised becomes enlightened by the presence of the Angel Lord Stop Moses now he's on his Ro road so let me ask you this because there's Darkness does that mean we quit using the light that's time does that mean we start questioning the light well my Bible says if we walk in the light as he is in the light we have Fellowship one with another and the blood of Jesus Christ his son amen cleanseth us from all sin look at this in the Amplified Bible but if we really walk in the light that is live each and every day in the Conformity with the precepts of God as he himself is in the light we have true unbroken fellowship with one another are you ready for this he with us and we with him and the blood of Jesus Christ his son amen cleanses us from all sin I love this brother Thomas by erasing the stain of sin did I read that right by erasing the stain of sin keeping us cleansed from sin in all its forms and manifestations what are you saying I'm saying this I'm I I feel I I feel that devil pushing back at me I acknowledge let me let me let me just back up a second and say it like this I was preaching several years ago over at Josh Bennett on a Sunday morning and there was a sister there I've never seen her since she just come up to me at the service so while I was preaching I got to talking about bondage and condemnation and and and and and and things that's been put up on you and sins and scars and mistake all kinds of things like like like things you've been through and things people done and I just preached along there and I said these words brother Stephen I said now listen I said it wasn't the message that done that to you I said it's what a man done with the message I said the message didn't put that scar upon your life it's what someone did with a message that put the scar upon your life and when I said that brother Kelly she come to me after service she said brother Andrew for 20 some years I've said under bondage over something that happened by a preacher years ago and she said I've been scarred and hurt she said but this morning Jesus Christ came by my seat as the bomb in Gilead and showed me it wasn't the message she said I can say today I'm no longer offended at the message well can I say is amen if we preach this message the way brother Brandon preached this message it'll take a lot of nonsense away from the churches he preached this message as Jesus Christ raised from the dead as the savior of our sins as the Healer of our bodies as the god of Heaven as MDC now listen that word walk it means to make do use of opportunities now can I say this brother said when you see the light walk in it he said walk you don't know where you're going but keep walking now look here can I can I can I tie this together and say this we are not going backward we are not [Applause] retreating we are advancing we're going forward brother R said in spite of dungeons or swords or storms God's Great Church marches onward and we're so happy to be a member of that blessed body looking shortly for the coming of our blessed Lord who will receive us up into his kingdom into his presence there will be ever with him oh the Glorious thought and the joy the joy that sweeps through our souls come on Church The Joy say it with me the joy Jo that sweeps sweeps through our souls our soul when we look when we look upon these promises oh hallelujah hallelujah the joy that sweeps through our souls when we look upon these promises and the Holy Spirit bearing us record that they are the truth are you hearing me what do you sweep out you sweep out stuff that don't belong there come on when dust starts collecting and when dirt starts collecting you get you a broom and you start sweeping and you sweep out the dirt you sweep out the dust you know why because it don't belong there can I say this to you spoken word Tabernacle it's time to let the Holy Ghost it's time to let the Holy Ghost come through the church and sweep out our souls sweep out our soul come on y'all remember we used to have joy when we looked at quotes we used to have joy when we looked at certain scriptures but things started Gathering but can I say this you can't afford to let it gather you're Enoch you're Enoch and you got to walk you got to walk you got a destination you got to get your eyes off the left you got to get your eyes off the right you got to get your eyes off of YouTube get your eyes off of news articles get your eyes off of man's ideas get your eyes on the rich and guarantee of the resurrection and let the message of the [Applause] hour let the message of the hour let it become a reality to you again now I say this to you and I'm done brother said the thing of it is today the church green don't want to go on they don't want to mature they want to go back to Moody's time or sank or finny or Knox or Calvin they were all all right they were L of the hour but this is another hour this is another day this is the advancement of the Gospel it's coming to its maturity so we cannot live in what Luther said or Wesley said or some of the rest of them we've got to live in the light that's predicted for this day we're in the seventh Church age not the third or fourth Church Age The Grain should be able to receive it that's right if it doesn't it falls off and it means nothing to it the grain is matured with the light [Applause] brother Steven the grain is matured with the light now you all shouted amen at that part of the clo can you shout to the rest of it if it goes ahead with the [Applause] light what does that word walk mean it means to take advantage of opportunities so the grain will mature with the light but it's got to go on come on Church you got to trust the life that's leading you you got to trust the light that's leading you you got to trust that this light knows your future come on Church you got to trust that this light can get you [Applause] there now I'm I'm going over but y'all forgive me I'm I'm I'm tying this together Enoch he was the top of the Bride right he was a Believer now when you when you mention Enoch do you know Enoch done many things ahead when you mention Enoch do you know Enoch built a pyramid Enoch a stonemason built a pyramid a a pyramid that was full of Revelation that pyramid if you ever get time he meant to go in there and walk through all the Avenues and areas and Chambers and places that pyramid is loaded with Revelation do you know there's things in that pyramid that represent bread do you know that in that pyramid there is a king's chamber and there is a guard that stands on the final step to go in it's all in that pyramid and Enoch built it but if I walked up to you and I said Enoch what's the first thing you think of he he his [Applause] walk you don't think of Enoch Enoch built a pyramid no Enoch walked Enoch it don't Enoch built a pyramid it said Enoch walked with God do you know why it says Enoch walked with God because the Revelation that was in the pyramid had come into Enoch and it was in his walk Enoch's walk was a perfect reflection of the Revelation he was believing oh spoken word Tabernacle do you hear me tonight it's time to get up it's time to get up it's time to quit looking at the world it's time to quit looking at religion and start looking at the message of the hour again and let the Revelation influence influence your walk let our musicians come tonight Enoch walked in the light of translation the church which is a type of Enoch 500 years he walked before God he didn't displease him Enoch just kept walking in the light so one day he felt his feet getting off the ground and he just kept on walking and he walked on him to Glory without even Dying God took him away because he was walking in the light with a testimony he walked in the light of God he says kept walking walking will you will you receive a prophet's worse tonight let's get on our walking shoes [Applause] Church let's get on our walking shoes it's time to walk these things have become a reality to us can I say this to you if you'll just get in the light the light does the work remember talking to that man he said I don't believe in divine brother said well that's to your opinion he said hey he said won't you come home with me brother said I'd like to but I can't he said well he said where you live he said oh over the mountain there I said how you going to get there you don't see your house he said well there's a path that runs up over the hill I said you don't even see the path he said well I got a message I mean I got a lantern I said the lantern won't show the light right on the house he said oh no but the path will lead to the house he said that Lantern will only show life for one step at a time Glory that Lantern won't show the house but it'll show one day at a time it'll show One Step at a Time come on Church listen it wasn't if that man didn't have a house or not he knew he had a house he knew he had a theophany oh God he knew he had place he knew he had a place that was not made with hands but he only had a way to get [Applause] there come on he turned the light on the light didn't shine directly on the house I got to stop he said one step at a time children of light except his word Keep On Walking watch more unfold no matter what anybody else says you stay right in it just keep walking just keep walking with it watch it unfold Hall and reveal itself walk in the light want you stand your feet [Music] tonight this light this light is an absolute light brother Steven this light is anchored said oh how great it is today my poor decrepit friend that when a man who has never noed power I want you to listen to this to a man who's never knowed power to give new light to give New Hope when he walks into the presence of the Divine person of Christ with a faith that holds him Spellbound to his majesty it's like it isn't like walking the Altar and giving the ministry your right hand neither is it like going into the pool to be baptized or standing with a shell to be sprinkled it's walking into a light that you have never witnessed before it's an anchor somebody say it's an anchor an anchor of a Divine faith that CS anything contrary to the word of God as though it wasn't come on church I'm just going to say what a prophet said can we identify the it as the light he said it puts new life it gives hope to the dying it gives courage to the weak it gives healing to the sick it gives blessings it gives blessings to the unfavored not I it the light how wonderful it is to step into the light of his presence it's not a myth neither is it something that somebody is just fleshly in their minds drawn up but it's coming directly into the presence of the king of glory it's the eternal light of the Living God Amen can I say this to you I realize I realize tonight that we've said some pretty strong things yes but I'll say this to you tonight as a gospel preacher as a as a as an end time message
