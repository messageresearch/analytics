went well everybody went fine and everybody came back safe without any accident any trouble we want to thank the Lord for it let's give him a big clap of thank you thank you I'm gonna go straight quickly to my uh announcement so we can jump into the word I believe everybody is up to date with the sermon I believe everybody is reading their Bible twice a day I believe everybody is reading the Cod book one question a day the church ages the 70 weeks of Daniel and the seals remember on the day of judgment you will see this over and over but I don't want you to go to judgment I want you to pass through Mercy without going into judgment so you don't have to stand before an Angry God that's what the scripture says amen we had a wonderful young sisters meeting yesterday we follow up and by God's grace I believe all the questions were already taken care of so Lord's willing uh sister Divine will work together and see the next meeting so we can jump into another subject and try to move on Amen the Bible says a wise woman buildeth her home how can you build a home you're not a man that's fine okay so schedule and we'll work it up together and we'll move on Amen I just repeated the scripture is my Bible different than your Bible so you ask the Bible why do you is he written like that I can only repeat to you what the prophet say Amen Lord's willing this Saturday the Lord we will have the Young's men meeting unless there is any changes we'll let you know so create a habit to always check your WhatsApp chat group to make sure we stay up to date but Lord's willing to the best of my understanding it's this coming Saturday September 2nd question and answer will be on September the 16th amen and you prayed for me because I was in a Channel of prayer I have not finished prayer yet but there was a request to preach about courtship I usually don't want to tackle his subject in the air I wanted to sit down and to see what brother Branham says about it go to the scripture and cook it very good and then we bring it together not just touch up quickly and then we have a lot of question going on so be patient with me pray for me because you are getting blessed and the devil is firing everything toward me because of what has been delivered and preaching so it's like constantly I'm on a fight but my muscle are growing bigger and bigger and bigger every day amen you might be seated for two minutes as I'm giving sister Charlene her Bible she really loved this Bible she claim it and she didn't receive it so sister Charlene already graduated so come on and get your Bible God will bless you amen she's really persistent and by staying persistent you're gonna get what you want from God Amen brother Brandon preacher message persistent so stay persistent and God will bless you amen so let's go straight to our scripture this morning appreciate your passion with us and the technician and everything they're doing the best that they can we're just in a fight but everything is okay we have the victory glory to God Hallelujah that will be uh okay so you know what is coming up right you know what's coming up right so don't sleep don't get into any distraction let's see where we can get with this Genesis chapter 26 uh chapter 1 verse 26. if you're there you can say a man we're still in the same channel and by God's grace let's see how deep we can go with this everybody there 26 praise God and God say let us make man in our image you might be seated usually when we say image we need to know what we're talking about how does God look like when we say Good Man was created in the image of God was he created like what amen the Bible says this this is Paul who's speaking in second Corinthians chapter 4 verse 4 that in whom the God of this world has blinded the minds of them which believe not we already are believers so that's not our part lest the light of the Glorious Gospel of who Christ Christ who is the what image of God so everybody good so the image of God is who Christ we're clear now so let's continue our scripture now so when God say lets us make man in our image so man was a logos amen man look like the pillar of Fire amen I already went through this amen the man that was created looked like a Halo right there the image of God is Christ and Christ is the logos Christos the anointed one that's why you heard brother Brian I'm saying Adam was in the theophany and then he said Adam was bypassing the tea off and we already resolved that question because after he was created in the tearth and God took him away from the tiovanny everybody okay everybody good he's the Father of Lights if he is light God is light if God make bring of bring forth a child that child will be what right is there a problem easy brother Angel all right blessed be the name of the Lord amen he say let us make man in our image after our lives and let them so it's a plural amen have dominion over the fish of the sea God have not created many yet remember that this is his project this is his plan for man what God is putting up together about man amen so your conception in the mind of God goes with your purpose have I lost anyone blessed be the name of the Lord today he will cry amen so when man is created on the conception of God in the mind of God God doesn't create men just like that God didn't create men to see how powerful he is that's not the way God created man no God didn't create men to see if he can make a man God was creating man with a purpose so the conception of man when man is conceived in the mind of God God is mingling his conception with his purpose in other words you can never separate men from his purpose in other words you have a purpose if you are a man if you are created in the image of God you have a purpose amen everybody okay so the conception of men amen and the purpose of man is together amen amen in other words God doesn't create something without a purpose when God want to make something there is a purpose everybody okay the problem is Adam here doesn't exist yet he is in the conception he is in the design room of God Amen God is Discerning Adam and he's Discerning Adam according to the job or the task that Adam will do everybody okay if God is conceiving a woman he is cons he is conceiving a woman with the purpose of what the woman needs to do so when you come in you must carry a baby because you were created as a woman [Applause] if you don't have a baby you need to go back to God are we together okay thank you he say and let them too have dominion the very purpose of man was to have dominion so when man is created he is already in a position to dominate amen dominion over what the Bible says over the fish of the sea over the fall of the year over the cuddle over all the Earth and over every creeping thing that creepeth upon the Earth so man is built to dominate whatever is in this earth everybody good this is God in his design room in his conception now God finished the designing God didn't create Adam until he finished Adam God didn't start making Adam until he finished Adam the one that is making your car they already have your car on the computer man is in the image of God when they finish your car in the computer the house they building they already have your house built sometimes when they start construction you will see they even give you the picture of the house in other words your house already existed so they don't start the building your house if it's not finished already on a computer the house is already finished on the computer everybody okay so when they start building the house they don't guess they don't stop and say what are we going to do in this step they're just following what he's supposed to be doing so when God begin to build you God will never stop in your life and say what am I supposed to do at this time in other words whatever you go through in your life amen God will never stop and God say I didn't see this before how am I going to deal with this before you are built you already finished glory to God amen dominion over what the color over the fishes over all the Earth amen now verse 27 so God created man now God is putting into manifestation what he conceived everybody clear God is creating man in his own water image do you see God changing the pattern there he's just following the computer the computer say In His Image God have to stay with his plan Amen in his when God make his plan he will stand for eternity because God cannot come back and fix something and say there was a mistake made like that God put his material according to the Future don't worry my friend we'll get there he said in his own image karma in the image of who God which is Christ remember in the image of God created he him what man and what female created he damn now the man that was in the computer Mind Of God I'm saying that so we on the same page in the computer Mind Of God is no longer in the computer now the man is outside now the man is outside he needs to know why he's here everybody okay God need to tell him what he has in his mind everybody okay so when you leave the conception mind of God and you become a reality amen you need to know what was in the mind of God before you existed you need to know why am I here what was in the mind of God when he sent me here what am I supposed to do everybody okay we clear so far we're clear verse 28 and God did water bless them okay the blessing comes the man is already created so when you get to your relativity you need to wait for the blessing of God everybody okay God bless him you need to follow me carefully there are many things that are happening in this church that I cannot even tell you because some of them are private so God is doing big things in this church I can't even tell you because if I tell you I was gonna open people's privacy it will blow your mind up you just heard one here with brother person right have you ever get in a discount of a hundred sixteen thousand dollars you're gonna believe the impossible even if you don't want [Music] I will make you believe the impossible I will put it so much into your mind until you dream it because our mind is so intellectual it is for your own benefit if I'm fought some of them you will be spinning because somebody is understanding what we're preaching they are believing it they're not arguing with it and God is blessing them amen it's happening here so don't stay behind watch the word follow the word don't follow me follow the word everybody okay and God blessed them and God say to them not to him there were two of them so both of them are beneficiary of the same thing the woman and the man let me leave it alone amen he said be fruitful and do what multiply and do what replenish the Earth so God is now responsible to replenish the Earth anymore you the one to do that you don't want to multiply no more God amen the commission is multiply number one number two be fruitful number one number two multiply number three replenish the Earth number four sub do it and if you notice it's gonna be five amen and number five and half Dominion five everybody okay have dominion over the fish of the sea of every living thing that moves upon the Earth if you notice all these things or were already created before Adam God created every fish or everything else he will Adam was the one that was created last so when Adam come to the world he looked into the word he's seeing creatures that are moving he's seeing fishes and he sees uh what do you call it uh what founds he sees the ego the The Hulk everything then Adam need to know should I run away from this or should I are these my friend everybody okay so God now is telling him that everything that you see there you need to dominate it in other words when Adam meet a lion amen the interpretation of Adam for a lion it means I need to dominate you when Adam meet aware he means dominant when Adam meet an elephant no matter what the elephant is doing in the mind of Adam dominant if Adam come across a big mountain his man say dominant so everything that Adam see is under him in other words even if a lion comes before Adam and begin to roll Adam will be laughing because everything that the lion is doing he means dominate in other words there was no more fear in Adam [Applause] are we together are we together a man was conceived in the mind of God that man was created but even though he's created he need to know the purpose that God has in his mind before he created him therefore God to reveal to man his purpose he comes with a blessing and when he blesses the man he's giving him instruction or revealing to man the purpose for what he created him amen we clear so far we clear listen to what Brad Ibraham says glory to God brother Branham says that in Genesis 1 26 when God made man he made him a god because he gave him a dominion and he had rulership he had power over the birds of the air the cattle over the winds the wave the fishes of the sea everything he had dominion over everything we just read that he was a ruler and anointed ruler because he was in the likeness and in the image of God with an Earthly domain God gave him the Earth we went through that last Sunday that is why the Bible says that the Earth is groaning crying waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God the world is waiting for the man to come back into his right estate amen what is the right to State dominate everything [Applause] not dominate your brother not dominate your sister but dominate the element of the Earth now he is made in the image and the likeness of who God that makes him when God made him God give him some of his water spirit part of his life and he is in the likeness and the image of oh god let's go to Luke chapter one a whole message is already been preached amen Glory Glory Hallelujah if you dare you can say Amen we read this last week I'm just going to read the portion of it amen amen verse 30 if you dare you can say amen amen and the angel said to her you remember this now fear not amen Mary for you have found favor with God you remember that last week amen do you remember that and behold you shall conceive in your womb so God promised a seed for the woman and that seed was Jesus Christ but we need to know how is that seed coming when God say I'm gonna send the seed of a woman God put the word seed and the woman together but a woman doesn't have a seed the seed comes from the man so you need to know what is God talking about it means there will be a woman and there will be a seed but that seed doesn't belong to that woman it is just a combination of a woman with a seed they see this crust the woman is the carrier of the seed now the problem is we need to know now who is that woman Isaiah come down he say a virgin shall conceive now we know that the woman that will conceive or carry the seed is going to be a virgin that is even more complicated because a woman to begin with don't have a seed and a virgin is more even sealed than a woman who is married in other words how can a virgin woman have a seed he have to be created by God it's a seed that was created by God himself [Applause] it is an Immaculate birth it is not the blood of a human it's a created blood of God everybody clear so far but now we know each a virgin Every Woman born is a virgin who is that woman a woman is born but she doesn't know who she is now God send an angel a messenger to reveal to that woman the purpose that God has for her on Earth in other word Mary thought she was just a young girl Mary thought she was only married to only are engaged to somebody she didn't know the thought of God for her God has a plan for Mary but to receive that plan Mary needed some instructions we okay now Adam needed some instructions why do we need those instructions amen verse 32 he shall be great and shall be called the son of the highest and the Lord God shall give him the Throne of his fatherhood David and he shall reign over the house of Jacob forever and his kingdom there shall not be no end there shall be no end I don't even want to add something to the Bible not even no I don't want it amen then say Mary to the angel how is this be seeing I know not air man you see the seed and the man intellectually is kicking in Mary have to believe something that was never done to anybody brother Branham say Elizabeth has example in the Bible because Sarah had a baby Hannah had a baby there were many sparren women that had babies but Mary have something that was never done in other words sometime in your life [Applause] God might revealed to you something that never existed before [Applause] everybody okay in other words God can reveal to you something that nobody else has ever done before Jesus said the work that I do you shall water you also and you will do even how greater at the beginning brother Brown I'm taught he's gonna repeat what Jesus said but when the seals were broken brother Branham saying no no no no no no no greater doesn't mean many more it means something greater he said if you notice Jesus before he multiplies something before he creates something Jesus has to use a substance they have to give Jesus a fish for him to create a fish but Jesus opened the door he said you can do more than me so brother Branham didn't need anything [Applause] now brother Branham begin to create out of nothing [Applause] [Music] [Applause] if the word of God that comes to you seems to be impossible to you you need to know that you already have the potential for that impossible amen if not God will never send that word to you amen because you can't handle it so what God sends you in your life he already know you got a receiver for it amen foreign [Applause] you see the USB cable they match together they are some charges that will work on my cell phone it won't work in your cell phone because we got two different phones so if God gives you a charger just know it's gonna match your phone even if he looks strange it's not stranger God doesn't make mistake [Applause] [Music] the children God gave you he knows why why he gave you those children [Applause] my God where am I at verse 35 and the angel answer and say to her the water the Holy Ghost I know what I'm giving you is too big you don't have to worry about it all I've came to do is just to tell you what it is to bring it to pass that's not your problem God doesn't want you to bring it to pass he only wants you to do one thing just to accept it in other words your acceptance is what blocked the Holy Ghost if you don't accept the Holy Ghost this block if you accept it you release your Holy Ghost because God knows it's hard for you to figure it out God wants you to say that I don't understand them I know it's hard for me to believe it but because at your word [Applause] because I work Almighty and I didn't catch nothing at your word so now I'm I'm moving because of what you say that's all how the fish are gonna be there that's not your problem [Applause] thank you close right here and go home when your purpose is revealed you don't have to worry about it there is somebody who's responded irresponsible to make it happen because God interpret his word himself when he come to bring his word to pass he does it himself [Applause] hey when God promised you a baby how does the baby get there because before you did everything you didn't have a baby so how did the baby get there and sometimes they bear in most of the time all the time the babies getting there when you don't even know so the one who's maneuvering stuff there is not you you sleep I know where the baby is and know how to direct the baby and put him there foreign Hallelujah verse 35 and the angel answered and said to her the Holy Ghost shall come in other words how can this be how is this going to happen it happened by the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost shall come upon you and the power of the highest shall do what overshadow thee so who's actually putting the baby who's actually putting the baby in other words something will come over you and when it's coming over you it's not coming to just make you feel good it is coming to do something to create something amen something will come overshadow you therefore also the holy thing which shall be born of you shall be called what the Son of God and behold remember this last Sunday your cousin Elizabeth she has also conceived a son in her what old age and this is the sixth month with her who was called water bearing so she's no longer Baron amen that's why the Bible say the angel said who was called it was in the past for with God what nothing's nothing shall be have impossible with who God thank God verse 38 and Mary say behold they hence made of who the Lord she didn't say I am the child of my father she became the hands made of the Lord amen the hands made of the Lord beat unto me how according to Thy Word according to your water and the angel did water departed from that's all the angel want to hear from her I receive it because you said it and that said that's it the remaining I don't know everybody good let's go to Hebrew and then we start Hebrew chapter 4 glory to God amen amen amen amen if you dare you can say amen amen Hebrew 4 verse 1. let us therefore fear lets a promise being left of us of entering into his water rest any of you seems to come water short of it I don't want anybody to miss this that is what Paul is saying means what for to us was the Gospel preach as well as to who them the Jews Israel but the word which [Music] so you can listen to the word and it doesn't profit you you can listen to the word you can go to church and everything you're hearing doesn't profit you it doesn't change you why everybody okay you don't want that here amen he said did not profit them not being water mixed with faith in them that do water heard it so when the word comes remember you must have faith there so faith can take the word break it down for you and introduce the word in your system and now the word begin to benefit you if there is no faith the word is passing it's like you're pouring water on the duck's back impermeable everybody okay everybody okay job to verse 10. for he that has done what entered into his rest if you notice it is his rest it's the rest of God if you enter into the rest of God and we know the rest of God is the Holy Ghost everybody okay him who enter into his rest or him that received the Holy Ghost amen comma he also has water ceased from his own word so you have your work and the work of God there's two works amen so meaning this person at the beginning has his own work but when they enter into the rest of God amen their own work is finished so the rest of God put an end to your work [Music] help me you got your work amen and the work of God and God's work amen the Bible says when you enter into the rest of God the rest of God switched this off and it doesn't only switch this one off he turned this one on remember last Sunday the Bible said we were ordained predestinated unto good works you remember that Sunday you remember that Sunday and good is God right so there are certain work of you and certain work of God in other words you are double you are you and you are God foreign come on man we already went through this you are double everybody okay this is one two three is you and this is also you this one is God this one is the natural man and the Bible said when the Holy Ghost come when you enter into the rest of God Amen you cease from you you seize from your own work [Applause] and now God turn on another computer verse 10. for he that is entered into his rest he also has water ceased from his own Works he also sees from his own work as God did from water so once you receive the Holy Ghost your job is finished in other words the receiving of the Holy Ghost in your life God is coming to put an end of you so if I have an end of me what start amen dear where works that you were ordained before the foundation of the word and the Bible Ephesians say you were ordained unto good works we went through that last Sunday everybody okay so when the Holy Ghost come he turned this man off and he turned the Inside Man on so that they work their purpose of God that he had in your life Mary don't worry then the Holy Ghost will come he will overshadow you and the purpose that I'm telling you will be fulfilling you [Music] are we together have I lost anyone because with God nothing is water impossible now watch with you on the board Jesus say unto him if you can water believe what are possible to him that the water believe it so all things are not just possible to God you are so you are a god when you begin to believe you also all things are possible to you because God created this word by faith [Applause] you remember on Wednesday [Applause] let's pray now Heavenly Father Lord we are approaching you humbly this morning Father once again thanking you for your grace for your love and your mercy and for everything you have been doing for us father we have done what we can do as a man with the ability that you have given us from the Holy Spirit Lord may you come and move me and move the hero of the word completely away from ourselves may God speak to God may you come and anoint us and reveal to us our purpose and what we need to do because we need that so much in this time so that we will know our destination and our path will be easy father be the Alpha and the Omega seal every demonic spirit away from this place and those that were sick has been trouble with this weather May you touch them and heal them may not leave this church with the same symptom that they came in with but as they're leaving this church May every symptom disappear not by the work of men but the work of the Holy Spirit who is present in this place we humbly ask it father in the name of Jesus Christ amen my subject this morning is walking the four phases of roof walking by revelation or vision I can even call this working in the revelation or in division I'm gonna repeat it again working by Revelation or walking by vision we know that Faith according to brother Branham is a revelation everybody okay and Paul says this glory to God Paul said in second Corinthians chapter 5 verse 7 that for we walk by water faith and not by water Paul is saying we are walking now by faith everybody okay and we are not working by sight everybody okay everybody okay everybody okay another word Paul used to walk by sight [Music] I'm gonna get to that later if the Lord help me out but now since Paul is converted Paul say from now on I do not walk anymore by sight I walk by faith and we want you to walk by faith by Revelation or vision brother Branham says this glory to God he says it is a strange thing that man who was made in the image and the likeness of God and was called of him to walk out by faith believing that God is will choose to walk by sight instead of by faith [Applause] after his makeup he's been and all that Duos were in him was fashioned in the likeness of water God so brother Branham is saying God built man a certain way for a purpose and instead of man relying on the way God built him man is neglecting God in him to live with his own ability not knowing the power that lays in him not understanding the potential that God places within him brother Branham says and God is that great Jehovah who called those things which were not as though they were and man made to live with God in water this manner so man was made to live like a god in other words you call the things that are not as though they are so the problem with you is not about saying anything it's saying a thing here [Music] when you already seen it here any job here you can call into it [Applause] and the thing we're having this will say yes I'm coming [Music] [Applause] in other words they think you are looking for half an ear [Applause] father help your children amen yet he has chosen to do water walk by his side to walk by his side he want to be his own water boss he wants no one to tell him what I don't want nobody to tell me what to do [Music] me and my wife we don't want anybody to tell us what to do we don't want anybody to interfere in our marriages we don't want you to ninja in our family don't tell us what to do [Music] young couples everybody okay everybody okay because the old one learned the hard way they already got so much whooping and now they know how to obey God but the younger one think that they already figure out everything so they say don't tell us if anything until you get the whooping then you will see me waiting for you on the counseling and ready to begin to rescue you CPR one two three one two three until you resuscitate everybody okay he said he wants no one to tell him what to do that is just the nature of her man he proved to be that in the garden of water when he had lost his fellowship with God by choosing to go his own way not have anyone rule over what him God wants us to walk the way he created us to walk according to the way he made you God Made You in other words when God made you a woman stay a woman [Applause] there is a purpose where God wants you to be a woman when you want to change from a woman to a man you are telling God he made a mistake [Applause] if God made you a man stay amen man [Applause] amen behave like a man talk like a man run like a man amen shout like a man amen if God wants you a woman he would have made you a woman [Applause] a world of confusion because man don't want God to tell him what to do God when he look at you he said the best that I can do for you you're gonna be a man when he looked at you he said the best that I can be for you you're gonna be a woman you should be proud to be a woman amen you should be proud to be a man amen never desire like I wish I was a man no never even we get be happy the way God Made You God knows what he's doing [Applause] we don't understand what we're doing until we get women we turn them into men and before you know it we take a woman who became a pastor a pastor need to be a man amen because the church in the Bible is a woman and the pastor is representing God When a Woman become a pastor it is a lesbian spirit amen a woman cannot give a seed to a woman it's a homosexual spirit [Applause] [Music] no the purpose God created you know why you are the Way You Are God created you like King stay like him God created you God's things came that skin amen don't change your complexion you're a white man remain a white man you a black man or a man a black man you are Hispanic real man or Hispanic you are Chinese women a Chinese be proud of what God Made You oh man [Applause] I don't know if I will get where I'm trying to get my subject today is walking by water Revelation or walking by water Vision since we are dealing with Revelation and with vision we need to clarify those two areas amen glory to God I'm just reminding you on this help me my co-pilot brother pranam says that there is three elements that water people live in you remember this first it is why water the humanistic amen and second is what divine revelation which is also called what faith amen and third is water vision amen Vision Amen brother Branham say now this explaining humanistic he said like in prayer when you pray for anyone in water humanistic will y'all say well I hope you get well so hope is a humanistic level that's right which we already defined to be an intellectual faith because he uses the brain or the first conscience you remember all of this that's why I tell you to stay up with the sermon everybody okay we got a first conscience and the subconscious or second conscience and brother Branham say I'm hoping I'm believing with you trying to use all the faith that I can that is human second is water divine revelation when something is revealed to you you just know anyway your heart amen so Revelation doesn't come with a head no sir Revelation comes in the heart the head is the Hope Amen in the heart and the heart is where your soul is and it's called the subconscious or the second conscious amen or the second conscience Amen brother Branham uses those terminology and brother Branham say it happened in your heart it's going to happen yet there is nothing but just the water the Revelation he said and the third is water a vision of course that is what that says the Lord that is perfectly how positive that's why when brother Branham saw the vision he always say that's safe for the Lord amen amen that saved the Lord bear with me as I'm climbing brother Branham again says this following he says that there is three elements that people do what do dwell in living dwelling this first one is humanistic we done we say well I shall pray for that person I am hoping that now they shall get well now the next is divine revelation that is when some something done in your heart and say it's going to happen then something is going to happen then the third element is water Vision or the word of the Lord made water manifest the word of the Lord made manifest amen if I can make this clear or simple to you I'm going to explain it this way everybody okay this side is the humanistic everybody okay and the humanistic usually uses your five senses which is combined with your brain and the man's senses of everything is your sight we call that division or the scene world the visible world everybody okay everybody good now the other side opposite this is where divine revelation Lays we call this faith and this domain is the invisible one and it deals in your heart which is dealing with your soul everybody clear now this humanistic here handle the first conscience amen the sub uh the the Revelation handle the second conscience or the subconscious everybody okay and the easiest way to understand this thing the conscience is what you all are using right now everybody is right here they can look at me they can tell me what kind of clothing am I wearing what color am I wearing you using your brand you're looking at me going to the right to the left you're using your first conscience everybody okay the subconscience usually happen when we go to sleep when we go to bed this conscience doesn't know anything anymore amen but you still alive the one that is operating when you are sleeping is your subconscious that is what makes you dream everybody okay and you will see yourself in the dream talking you will see yourself in a dream walking running doing everything it looks like you are living in another world but that world is imaginary and when you wake up in the morning everything that you saw in the dream was just like a like an imagination you just woke up you still on your bed everybody okay so the subconscious is where you're dreaming amen so in between here everybody okay this is the domain of a vision everybody okay in other words the vision is a mixture of a revelation plus a visual I'm going slowly in other words division uses the first conscience and mix it with a subconscious and brother Branham say a vision is when someone doesn't go to sleep yet he can see something coming up like a dream brother Branham say what happened is the two conscience are stuck together it's an intersection of conscience everybody okay that's why the vision usually uses a vision or a dream when you have a vision you will see an image but it's not real but that image is not an image like a dream it's an image it's with an instruction to tell you what God wants to accomplish everybody okay if I lost you raise your hand glory to God Amen so a vision uses the visible and the invisible everybody okay Faith is invisible humanistic visible 100 this one invisible 100 that division 50 50 you can see an image and that image has a revelation in other words God will show you a dead baby that is raised brother Branham can see the baby smiling it means that that baby is going to be resurrected amen that is efficient everybody okay he can see the baby and he have the interpretation of that that the baby is gonna leave again everybody good everybody okay thank you Jesus third one then we start climbing Brother Brad I'm saying remember last night the human the water the river and the water the vision this is Hope I clarified to you there the human this is Faith the second one and this is perfection that's safe for the Lord right now I feel in this realm that God is fixing to do something I feel real good about something I don't know what it is but I feel that he's fixing to do something may his Blessing come to us now seeing that mass subject is about walking in the vision of the Revelation amen we would like now to exclude this guy completely because this guy is sight and Paul said I walk by faith and not by sight amen why are we excluding this thing because when we're dealing with the inward man the inward man is in the soul amen and if you notice the vision has an element that is coming from the invisible and the Revelation is completely invisible so in other words the domain that usually affects your seed is only a revelation or a vision the Revelation happened in your soul and in your soul you got the predestination division got an element of the Revelation so it still deal with the predestinated scene but other than that the predestinated seed won't use your brain because they predestinated seed doesn't reason amen everybody okay everybody okay so when we talking about working in the vision or working in the revelation we are talking about walking according to what is in your predestinated city because other than that you will be walking by sight but Paul said we don't walk by sight we walk by faith either you're gonna walk by faith or you're going to walk by Vision which is a higher Realm are we together why are you saying that brother Branham says this remember last Sunday when he could draw to his own water so what is in your soul that you join us see if there is water anything in there so in your soul there must be something there for you to draw and we found out that the people that are the children of God in the sword they got a seed we already went that to that clear in the ark of the in the in the Tabernacle you got the Ark of the Covenant he said if there is anything in there to do it but if the predestinated seed don't miss this now if that predestinated seed is not in there he will not judge through there because it shall draw from water so you must have a seed of God inside there because inside the seed there is a package remember last week everybody okay this is where we stopped last Sunday let's go Paul say what shall we then say to these things if God Be Water for us who can be how against us in either way nothing can block you if God has already determined something for you it's finished he's the absolute he is the top his decision is final if God have not spoken yet you can speculate you can say anything you want but once God brings that self the Lord or once God bring the Revelation he means everybody need to shut everybody good Paul say he despair not his own son you remember this The Treasure of heaven but deliver him up for us oh now let's get to our material ha shall he not with him also do what really give us all things God gave you the biggest treasure of Heaven which is the Lord Jesus Christ you remember that Sunday he looked at you he looked at Jesus Christ he esteemed you more than Jesus Christ and he put Jesus to be killed because of you and Paul is saying if the greatest thing in heaven can be trampled on the ground because of you tell me what else can God not give you in your life [Applause] because the greatest thing God can give you in your life is Jesus Christ amen and God already delivered Jesus Christ from you anything else is below Jesus Christ if you can touch God to the level of Jesus Christ what else is anything else that God cannot give you [Applause] everybody okay that's why God tested Abraham with his own son when God when Abraham was able to give God his only son God look he said Abraham you pass the last test because of what you do I will multiply you I will bless you I will fight your enemy whoever says something bad about you I will be his enemy why because Abraham you pass the last person and the last test is to give your only begotten son and God did it another word Abraham if you can give Isaac I don't have to ask you anything else because I know anything I will ask you you will give it to me if I would get if I would have asked you give me a donkey you will give it to me so I went to the top I said give me Isaac your only begotten if you are willing to give me Isaac so there is nothing that Abraham can refuse to me now because of that I can open up the treasure Abraham in blessing I will bless you in multiply I will multiply you I will multiply your seed your seed shall possess the Gate of your enemy why because you passed the last test [Applause] so when we were in trouble God also showed you his last test towards you in other words God is telling you like Abraham I am ready to give up my child for you in other words you need to understand my language that there is nothing else that you can ask me and I'm not able to give you thank you [Applause] because the Son of God that I gave is nobody else but myself I give my honor because of you tell me what else can I give you what is hard in your life that I cannot provide because I provide for the greatest thing that you cannot pay you owe a debt you could not pay and I paid that debt show me another death show me another problem that you have in your life that that cannot help you [Applause] are we coming together are we coming together [Music] [Applause] Paul sometimes we read the Bible we don't understand what we're reading now Paul is saying so if God did that and gave you that how how how can not God give you freely did you pay God to give you Jesus the greatest treasure was given for free so what else is under Jesus that you need to pay for that's why everything else must be free everybody okay so how cannot God give you how freely what all things [Music] not when we say all things is fake amen because God has many things amen if you're a man you cannot ask God to carry a pregnancy it's only a woman that can ask God to carry a pregnancy it is a blessing but it's not for men so we need to be specific on what should I know [Applause] [Music] because God has many things what belonged to me add of those many things [Music] Ephesians 1 verse 1 11 in whom also we have water obtained an inheritance so we have obtained any inheritance being how predestinated according to the water purpose of him so we have a purpose the purpose of God for us amen who worketh all things what after the Council of his own will so everything that is going in or going on in your life if you have a predestinated sin God Is Watching to make sure everything is going according to his plan his purpose his cancer for you in other words if God sends you to be a pilot your whole life will begin toward that way God will make sure nothing move you from that path and God will make sure all your trial continue to push you toward that direction in other words everything that you is going through God is orchestrating them according to his plan another way there is nothing at the career in your life even though he looked chaos there is no chaos God is the one that allowed the chaos sometimes my friend don't worry my friend we going that mystery that purpose that God has in your life God usually called that purpose in a mystery in other words God seal it God hide it in a mystery so nobody knows what it is everybody okay so when you're trying to know that God lock it when the devil wants to look it up the devil can look look but he doesn't understand because it doesn't belong to him glory to God brother Barnum say uh Paul says but we speak the wisdom of God in water a mystery why why should Jesus speak in Parable because Jesus said listen the reason why I'm talking to Parable it's not to them to understand this thing it is to you everybody okay okay he says even the what hidden wisdom which God did what ordained when before the world our Glory so that purpose of God is For Your Glory [Music] may God help me reach where I want to reach so the purpose that God has for you is not for your distraction because God proved to you that he already put something in you that belonged to you God put something in you to identify Who You Are God put his fingerprint on you God put his DNA on you [Music] [Applause] one day you've sinned amen and Eve did the problem the Bible say Adam was the son of God that's what the scriptures say in Luke 3 38 Adam was the son of God when Adam looked at Eve if you notice when God came God struck The Serpent and flipped him completely and change him from another creature to another creature but God never changed Adam when Adam looked at him he say my wife is in trouble do you know what Adam did Adam took his seed and put it in evil everybody okay when God is coming who did this it is when God look at it if you look inside is he able [Music] [Applause] do you follow me in other words God cannot destroy you because destroying it will destroy evil Adam put a lock so that God cannot do anything [Applause] [Music] so in your life when you are born God put the predestinated scene [Applause] so no matter how much God is upset towards you when God is so mad because of what you're doing why did he look in you [Applause] God back up another thing because there is a path of God in you God cannot destroy God [Applause] if he destroy you he destroyed himself [Applause] Jesus has to trouble disciple Jesus had two disciples that were very troublesome they were his church remember that was a headache one of them was Peter another one is Judah why did he pray for Peter and don't pray for Judah because every time he looked at Peter he said oh boy this belonged to me because the Bible said he knew Judah from the beginning and he also knew Peter when peace they want to go to trouble he said don't worry be there I pray for you [Applause] Peter you won't fail your faith Warfare you're gonna go through headache but remember you all fail I pray for you even though the devil spoke through you but still the devil cannot have you [Applause] people was anointed by Satan but Jesus never gave up to be there because he said then you can take Judah but not this one this one I claim him this belonged to me and when Jesus is resurrecting the first disciple he's asking God tell Peter I want to make you happy that is all right [Music] in other words when I took my journey to paradise I was worrying about Peter now that I finished my journey as soon as I come back while speeder Peter is good okay that's it come on Peter come on be the I'm gonna give you the Keys of the Kingdom [Applause] [Music] nothing can change God's plan for you if God be for you who can be against you [Applause] allow me to move my friend I'm trying Paul says which none of the prince of this world knew for they had known it they would have not watered crucified the Lord Of Glory but as it is written eyes has not what see so it's not visible yet and no ear has what nobody has preached yet neither have he entered into the water man it's not a revelation yet so God hide it [Applause] nobody have seen it yet nobody has preached it yet I have not taught you yet but I made you for a purpose I created you for a purpose that purpose I and you alone [Applause] Oh Glory to God I have not seen no ear has water neither enter into the heart of her man where Revelation come the water things plural with who God has water prepare it's prepared for what them that love him what does love him means because he is the word and Jesus say I am the way I am the truth and the Bible say God put the love of the truth in you so you can be safe so this guy here love God and if he loved God God has something prepared for this guy but he sealed it he hide it in a mystery walking by Vision Oh by Revelation amen how do we know that he said but God has water revealed them unto us by water his spirit all things for the water spirit such as water all things the spirit such as water all things he had given us freely water and the Spirit come and searches what all things to know what belongs to you amen [Music] the spirit of God when he comes in your life he's bringing the specific purpose of God for your life deep things of God do you want me to preach the things oh we don't want deep things How Are You Gonna Know Who You Are how are you going to know the purpose of God for you because those things are deep in God they are not on the front part of God they are in God bad part man we need the spirit of God to go inside and tell us what do we need in our life and I continue for what man knoweth defense of water amen save the spirit of man which is what in him so nobody knows what brother Charles is thinking except the spirit of brother Charles who is in brother Charles the same thing applied to God so even so the things of water God no man knoweth but the water spirit of God so it takes the spirit of God to go in the mind of God to go in the conception of God to see I'm God I'm coming here for Brother David why did you create that Brother David why did you create that brother Benjamin what is his purpose on Earth what package do you have for him can I continue are we together glory to God he said now we have received not the spirit of the water the world because you're going to know the things of the world but the spirit which is of water God why that we my no the things that are freely look right here God gave us freely water all things are we okay together now the spirit comes for you to know the things that are water freely Give In To Us by who of God so the spirit of God when we say God give us freely of things we don't know which specific things are for us so the Holy Ghost now coming in your life need to God to God and to see what is the freely stuff that you have for sister shikana bring it to me amen so that I can tell her what to do because she need to know how to walk she needs to know how to talk she needs to know what she need what whichever direction she needs to go in her life if not she doesn't know what to do she will be copy copying everybody but we don't want her to copy she has seized from her own work it is time for the new worker tell me the new work that she need to walk into them [Applause] can we continue amen Paul continue he said but the natural man receive not the things of the spirit for they are how foolishness unto him humanistic level you won't get it amen neither can he know them because they are how spiritually deserved but he that is spiritual judge if water all things yet he himself in charge of who no man because you've never done it to begin with [Applause] are we together he said for who has known the water the mind of the Lord that he may water instruct him but we have the water mind of Christ [Music] what does demand of Christ mean amen Paul say we have the water mind this thing is already in US who brought that in US who brought this conception this purpose that was in God who transferred those data from God and downloaded them in US because now whatever is in the mind of God it's also in me who downloaded the USB who brought the ucsp and begin to download the software so now me and God we are communicating with a software the Carolina Medical Center in Charlotte can communicate with the Carolina Medical youth service center in uh in uh in Gastonia Atrium Charlotte and Atrium Gastonia they communicate if you go there they can just put your name and they pull your file and everything that they did over there thank you the software has been established everybody okay what is the mind of Christ glory to God brother Branham say God is known how by faith you do what accept it and you do water believe it you can't do it until something happened where in you you cannot do it until something happened in you not outside of you everybody okay brother Branham say then the who the Holy Spirit comes where in and you have the water the mind of Christ so when the Holy Ghost enter you as soon as he reached the predestinated seed he pulled his USB and he hook it together and he begin to transfer data are we together the spirit of the Lord begin to transfer the database [Music] is bringing the mind of God in you that man is the purpose of God for you [Applause] are we together are we together glory to God hallelujah what are you trying to say brother Branham says this why so there is our genuine Faith a genuine Faith but you must come into the real Waters channel of God to have water that genuine Faith you must have the good uh cable ah you cannot just come anyhow you must have you must be wired pretty good you must have the password the Wi-Fi is available but if you don't have password it's security locked everybody okay I'm going down this way so I can break it down until you grasp it everybody okay because we are in the computer time everybody okay and brother Brandon said there is a human faith then there is water the faith of God and you must have a Godly Faith to do what now then to have Godly Faith you must have the water the mind of Christ in you then how that that is how God do what the projects to you visions let me say that again when the Holy Ghost come in you as soon as he entering you he take the cable and he hooked now brother pranam is saying you have the mind of course downloaded in you and through the mind of course God now begin to send vision God begin to send revelation [Music] he comes progressively because you have season in your life your seed have seasoned so the Revelation come by season if the season arrives the Holy Spirit pushes [Applause] are we okay walking by Revelation or by what Vision brother Branham say then when your man when the man of Christ is now with you he said then that is how God do what projects project to who you do you what Vision plural or water Revelation all these things come by demand of water Christ being well in you you gather let the man that was in Christ beware in you so when the mind of glass gets into you God now can begin to send the freely stuff that he has for you in a vision way or in a revelation way not humanistic because he's done in your soul everybody good everybody good why are you saying this brother Branham say watch Faith take a hold right quick the old things are water passed away but Moses now has a water a new vision has a water before that he had not met God he only read and know what his mother had taught him about brother pranam he only knows what daddy and mommy told him about the message of the hour everybody okay he told him by what hearing what his mother has said or hearing what brother Stephen has said [Applause] in other words before that you were walking by intellect you were walking by sight Moses was walking by an intellectual conception of God until God does something to him are you following me please help me okay which way I'm reaching amen amen he said but now Moses has a water a personal experience that is what the church need when tonight he just stops studying so much water Theology and get done where to The Altar and do what to pray until a water a personal experience burns down into the water the human heart and burn all of the water and give you a water a new vision because when a new vision enter your direction in life begin to change amen [Applause] Moses never went to Egypt the way he came out of Egypt the Moses that went to Egypt was another Moses the Moses that was in Egypt fled the one that was going to Egypt was going toward the danger the first one was running from the danger the second one was going toward the danger in other words the second one when he entered Egypt he looked at an Egyptian he means to dominate amen he looked at Pharaoh dominate amen he looked at Dennis Chambers Dominic because he has a new vision he has a new instruction he has a new project that has been given to him by God now his his speech changes [Music] [Applause] help me help me Lord help your children catch this one amen God speak many ways speak many ways once the holy spirit is getting your life establish the connection God begin to send vision and to send Revelation you say brother Stephen how do I know that or how am I gonna know that hahaha the Bible says in the Book of Job that God speak what once yeah water twice yet men to utter perceive with it not in other words God speak one way or another but we don't catch it everybody okay why is it important to catch this brother Branham say I want to tell you something now work on that water pulsation did like Mary Magdalene did all those just that moment when something is water revealed to you what do you have to do grab it and do whatever go to it that water spur of a moment amen so when you are born again you need to be on alert because any time Heaven May dispatch something towards you anytime God can send a signal towards you you need to be quick to recognize the signal grab the signal and move into it don't never procrastinate for tomorrow what you can do today [Music] let me move on God will help you brother Branham says this now the way that obeys friends on this as Faith are probably feel like that I might be an amateur in that but where my faith is based is concerning your water again a gift that water was given me that was given to me brother pranam is using his gift follow me carefully some people receive a water a revelation some people pick it up where out of the word some people takes it by what inspiration man is a water a vision when I see those Vision happen there is nothing in the world that can change it amen so God can send his signal by inspiration God can send his signal by revelation God can send his signal by Vision God can even use the Bible when you read it and you will see like a scripture is jumping towards you that scripture that is jumping towards you and your heart is kind of pulling the Scripture it is a signal God is telling you this is what I want you to do [Applause] amen that Mary before the angel met her she was reading the scripture that pertained to Jesus Christ and brother Branham said as she was reading something begin to touch Mary like this scripture is so strange today why because the angel was bringing the message [Applause] everybody okay sometimes you read the Bible and you read it like newspaper but when you read the Bible and you

package he said for this obstacle God wants him to speak to the Moon Joshua speak to the Moon why nobody else ever spoke to the Moon only you where is he written in the Bible that somebody already spit up the Moon and the Sun that is not your problem this battle according to the project of God to win this battle you must speak to the moon and you must speak to the Sun if you and brother Branham said this is what Joshua did when he hit Joshua Joshua didn't move left he just stopped he said hey human stop right there son stop by there that said the battle is one you must catch that spare of a

spare of a moment the reason move on with that possession if God put in your heart that God brought the son so don't hesitate pick up the phone and call [Applause] father help me up glory to God Amen brother Bonham says I will grant you this it is psychology in this way saki of course means what mind it is the mind of who Christ that is the human being has the privilege to enter in and no demand of who Christ Hallelujah my what a reality to dwell in the channel of Christ we are worthy Mortals have been brought in to be Sons and Daughters of God to be fellow citizens oh my I get to shouting when I get notice in the into that realm where even what angels can come you say angel yes sir it doesn't belong to Angel [Applause] everybody okay amen he said we are water and daughter Angela house servant that's why the serpent cannot go where the son and daughter will go daughters your father want to say something that's why he's entering you into that relationship amen get this and I'm gonna search the airport the Bible says remember the water the form of things for I am who God and there is no one else I am God and there is none like me how is that God he declared the end from the water beginning in other words when he start he already finished amen everybody okay from ancient storm the things that are not yet done saying my Water Country for you shall do what and I will do all my water so whatever I have conceived on my mind I will fulfill it and I already conceive it before the beginning because before I begin to make Adam I already have Adam and I already seen the life of Adam that's the reason why I'm speaking these things about Adam I love Jacob when I say I love him I don't tell you that I didn't see he will lie that's not my problem the problem is what I have purpose for Jacob what have Jacob done nothing did he please you in eternity no I just declare that I love Jacob [Applause] Lord help me out Jeremiah 29 foreign all the plants that I have that I wanted towards you think conception toward who you what are those plans say the who the Lord so God is saying that I have plans toward you I have a mind I have a purpose towards you what is that purpose he said thought of what peace and not of water evil to give you a water in either way to give you a future so my plan for you will make you somewhere it will take you from point A to Z father help me now let's get to the meat brother Branham saying in this we will liken the word of God God is a great water architect follow me carefully he's a great water Builder as God puts in his building water nothing but the water the very best [Applause] God when he built something he watches what material he's using and brought upon him say when God is building you he does nothing but put the very best material why is God infested with the best material why listen carefully my friend brother Branham say God building the foundation will put water nothing else but the water the best that there is because God is thoughtful of water his reputation amen God doesn't want people to make fun of him amen [Applause] that's why when Israel sin and God wanna destroy it Moses knowing God say don't worry about it you can destroy them all you want but Remy kindly reminds you you see the high part you see the Egyptians you see the German they will be laughing at you they will say you were God without power you take people to kill them when God remember his reputation he said no I must be the big God I must be the big shark God doesn't play with his reputation [Applause] what I'm trying to tell you is if you fail God failed you didn't get me well if you fail you will destroy the reputation of God because God invested so much in you if you fail you make God look like he didn't know how to create you because God invested his intelligence and he does the word his intelligence to be insulted [Music] listen my friend Isaiah water 48 verse water eleven for my own sake even for my own not for you for me for me not for he has nothing to do for with you this is me God this is me he repeat it twice this is me he said for my own water for my own water saying without water do it so I would do it because of me why for how should my man be water polluting I will not give my glory unto water another [Applause] if you have the glory goes to the devil and the devil will say I'm powerful than God God will never let that allow God that's why God equip you a certain way that's why you kiss him that's why even if you feel like you giving up you will feel something rising up it is not you it is God resisting [Applause] in other words when you reach a point in your life that you're trying to give away the god in you will wake up and say hey we're just about to lose a reputation here if she lost the whole neighborhood will say that message of William Marion Branham is alive but this message is the truth you will hear a stress coming from within [Applause] Glory in other words they challenge your God and your God is powerful my God is tremendous his strength never ended he will jump into the fire just to save a sinner like you why because he will never let his reputation be destroyed God cannot send people playing with his reputation you are his reputation [Applause] that's why whatever he puts in you is always the best the way God created you he created you with the best [Applause] why are you still alive till today why are you still alive why are you stealing this message despite everything despite the disappointment why are you still holding on it is not you holding on if you fail God failed help me help me my friend I'm trying to search for the airport he says God is thoughtful of water his reputation he's a god of what eternity he's a god of water heavens and earth he will never put nothing in his architect plan here but that would water stands at the time test the time pets for weapon eternity whatever God put in your life there is no trial that will destroy that even when you think like you went to go you didn't go too low the devil beat brother Branham beat brother Branham and brother Branham says something Rose in me [Applause] Hallelujah say brother Barnum say I better do what leave that we get into water shouting and get away we we get to thinking about what that if I begin to go deep into this you all will be shouting just like you did because God for that is just as true as God is how true God would never lose his reputation because he invested so much in you if you fail his product fell he's Masterpiece fell God don't want to sell a product and they come back they say this is junk it touches his reputation the product have to perform according to the manufacture and the people who turn around they say we love those products we love those brand amites they are honest people they are humble people they are very good people they are sweet people they are very good employee amen because of the product of God and the glory goes back to him and then God said yes this is what I want now I can bless you I can prosper you I can do everything you want amen because my reputation is at stake amen put your seat belt okay let me head to the airport can you allow me a few minutes let me get few minutes and I'll end the plane please follow me carefully Lord help me you there are you there amen are you there amen please follow me carefully the Bible says that then the water the word of the Lord then the water the word of the Lord everybody okay the word of the Lord did what came came to me this is Jeremiah because he was a prophet vision we okay now the word of the Lord the vision came unto me saying before I did what I formed thee in the belly I did what news me put your seatbelt and I'm gonna land the ship okay before I formed you I did water we clear right I know you and before that chemist out of the water I did what sanctify thee how can you sanctify somebody who doesn't exist where was the lamp slain before the foundation of the world where was that lamb who killed him can I continue can I continue before I formed you before that came is forth out of the womb I did what Sanctified and I did what ordain thee to be Prophet unto the water the nation stop so God is coming to Jeremiah Jeremiah says say oh who is this God what do you want he said Jeremiah you grown up now right say yes he said before I formed you I'm not talking about you now okay forget about you now I need to take you over there that's where things started you didn't know that because you bypass your to your father everybody okay before I form you I'm not talking about you being an adult I'm talking about before Mom and Daddy begin to quote when Mom and Daddy were younger before even that Jeremiah say really he said no you don't understand me before your grandpa and your grandma code together Jeremiah say yes he said no before your great great grandpa and your great great grandma mixed together before all of that I know you so me and you didn't start now are you following me and not only did I know you I already anointed you [Applause] [Music] for a task for a purpose that you wanted to do everybody okay when he said I ordain you to be prophet of the nation verse 6 then then said I Jeremiah he says what ah ah Lord we fought the suffering that I have here you say you knew me all this time can I continue he said ah Lord behold I cannot what speak for I am water a child stop there is two things here okay please allow me there is two things here there is the present stage amen and there is what we call truth the present stage is what built you until what you are now the present stage is filled with your civilization is filled with your family trait is filled with your genetics it's filled with your environment it's filled with everything the nation that you came out of it put in you and that form you and you accepted that to be you so when they say who's you you say this is me I'm an American now God is coming and say I'm saying you are not an American you are not an African that's just the nation that I chose to introduce you to this world before you become an American I know you do you follow me before you are what you are I already predestinated you to be something so now the battle begin between the truth or the word of God or the revelation of God all the vision of God and who you thought to you who they touch you you were so Jeremiah begin to bring God who he thought is he said God you don't understand me me being a prophet I don't even know how to speak how can God anoint somebody to be a prophet who will not know how to speak do you think God made a mistake no sir if God saw that speaking could be a problem he would not have sent Moses [Applause] everybody okay because Moses taught God I mean I have a problem of speech God said who formed the mouth so you think when I'm coming to you I didn't know you have a problem of speech do you think that's my problem whatever comes from your problem that's not what I'm looking at I want to bring you where we started do you follow me it's a banner between your present stage and what is truth truth is what God is telling you listen to me but uh Apostle uh Jeremiah say I say behold I cannot what for I am water a child but the Lord said unto me say not I am a water a child because I am speaking to you now you need to change your vocabulary in other words Jeremiah now you need to be working according to my vision no matter what they told you you are no matter what you are now no matter what you did you need to start changing your vocabulary and use my vocabulary and begin to deny your greatest enemy [Music] this man that Jeremiah was defending brother Branham call him the greatest enemy [Music] everybody okay why is he an enemy become he became because he become a blockage to implementing God's Vision in your life he became a blockage for you to begin to walk by revelation God is trying to bring you the new Direction in your life but this man begin to block it and say you don't understand I will stop that I'm incapable of going that direction I will start that with my education I cannot preach to King they told me you were seven years education there is nowhere you can stand before King he said William Martin I am the one sending you I am the one telling you when I tell you something you need to acknowledge me and speak like me because I already ordained you for what I'm telling you what I'm telling Adam is not different than what I already made Adam for what I'm telling Mary I know Mary will receive my word oh my God he said that shall go to all that I shall send you and whatsoever command thee that shall do what speak be not what afraid of the water your face for what I am with thee do you do what deliver thee say what the Lord God help me then the Lord put forth his hand and touched my mouth where you got the trouble and the Lord said unto him behold I have put my word in that now see I have said set thee all for the water the Nations he was already predestinated for it and offered the kingdom to do what root out and to do what pull down and to do it destroy and to do whatever throw down and to do water and to do what it's a plan look at the potential that is in Jeremiah so if Jeremiah want to plant he will plan if you want to rule that he ruled out God said this is my plan for you my plan for you was not what you're doing Peter he was not fishing sir I have a plan for you now you that fishing is going to be not for fish but you want a fish man father help me listen to this that therefore gird up their loans energized and speak unto them all that are commanded thee be not dismayed at the what faces let's start confirmed thee before them if you continue like this if you're afraid I'm gonna now make you tremble because I am the one who made you I'm telling you something you don't want to listen to me so if you don't want to listen to me I'm gonna make you shake now either you speak or me God make you tremble amen for behold I have made this day what defense City and the water and the present war against the whole land against the king of Judah against the princes they have against the president of against the people of water the land you don't know what I built you for and they shall fight against thee but they shall not Prevail against thee for I am save the Lord to deliver thee let's go to Roman 3 and I'm gonna stop Lord help me quickly let's go to Roman 3 then we nailed this oh Lord help me Romans 3 verse 3. I can get to Paul if you dare you can say Amen so we land this ship amen you there Roman 3 verse 3 Paul says this for what if some did not believe what unbelief make the faith of God what without a fact what God tells you for your life please don't expect people to believe with you [Applause] it is for you if they believe that far if they don't believe don't mix back somebody else even your husband even your wife might be doubting what God put in you [Applause] so don't expect everybody to come and say that sounds like a good Revelation I be living with you no damn belief will not stop God if they don't believe even if your pastor don't believe it will not stop what God have for you this is what Paul is saying Paul is saying if somebody didn't believe well damn belief change God plan verse 4 amen God forbid yea let God be what true but every man a what a liar as it is written that you might be justified in your sin and my overcome when you are what judge this is what I want you to get God forbid yes let God Be Water true true but every man a what a liar God is saying in your life every man God didn't put exception he's a liar and me God I'm true in other words when God said to you that I have for Daniel whatever everybody taught you that is contrary to what God is telling you you call that a lie I don't know if you get me what I'm saying Amen in other words if they tell you you are not fit to go to school and God come and say you're gonna have a degree all the report card everything that they told you you call that from that day you say all of you are liars in other words God wants you to esteem his revelation his vision his purpose for you more than anybody else [Applause] regardless of your present state father help me up brother Branham say when you come to a total water obedience then you can have what possession and but until you do it totally obey you get to completely do it surrender your own water your own water will your own water mine and let the mind of Christ do whatever operate in you [Applause] the purpose God is bringing you a vision is to give you a new direction for your life that Vision could be easy to believe or sometimes it's hard to believe amen but you must surrender everything else and begin to walk according to the New Vision that has been given to you God taught Studio he said Gideon foreign it's written in the Bible I am even the list of the family God look he said Gideon with this strength that you have go you're gonna beat that people like one man give your look at the people you cannot even number them and God is looking at Gideon he said go over there with the might that you have you're gonna handle those people you have two choices either you take God's word to be true all you take what your eyes are seeing but we walk not by sight we are walking by faith we are walking by division we are walking by the new instruction amen we are walking by whatever God's word begin to unfold to us for our life if you don't do that you won't get what God wants you to do everybody okay everybody good I can't get to Paul I'm Gonna Save that everybody okay but remember you must Surrender Your Own thoughts you must surrender this man right here and tell him body because when you enter into the rest of God this man masses his work must stop you must start the work of God and the work of God will come with an instruction it will come with a vision it will come with a revelation it will come with an inspiration he will come with God telling you something a possession a scripture a quote or maybe you listening to a sermon or maybe you're going on the road and you see a billboard that says something and something in your heart struck quickly and said look at that billboard it is God telling you no matter what they already told you before forget about it everybody okay the vision are coming the Revelation are coming to change your direction to show you the purpose of God in your life so that from now on you don't walk just by guessing now you are walking in the vision you are walking in the Revelation you are walking under inspiration you are doing things according to the purpose that God reveal in your life if God say you strong you say I'm strong if God say you heal you say I'm here if God say you bless you say I'm blessed if God say you're gonna get married tell him I'm gonna get married regardless of what everybody say that's not my problem mind God forget everybody let God's word be true and everybody else being a liar because his word will understand he's the same yesterday today and what Heaven and Earth will pass away but his word will be God bless you let's stand [Music] [Applause] I appreciate your patience buddy I will see when we can pick up and then move on again amen working in the faith in the Revelation by inspiration working in a new life that's why Paul said I walk now by faith and not by sight amen your arms work have to cease you have to pull yourself on the back and let God begin to work in your life we lie more in God he knows the purpose why he created you his reputation will never be a stake God's purpose will stand amen God won't play with his reputation let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we are approaching you humbly again father thanking you for your grace thanking you for your mercy thanking you for your love and for speaking to us Lord decem this morning and this afternoon father your word has been laid out and we continue to understand deeply what your Prophet stated that he can never overemphasize the need of a revelation for a believer Lord every person that is here even that is streaming now online you created them for a purpose before they were even formed before they came out for their mother's womb father you had a plan for them and the plan was to give them an expected end and it was a plan for their Glory father we came into this world we got caught into our neighborhood we got caught into our civilization we got caught on the spiritual amnesia we got caught in many various different things into this world until we are acting we are living we are reacting Beyond and Below what you expected as Lord father to be living in but father there is a from that time for everybody Lord there was a Dharma that we mind our own businesses there was a time that we did our own works and what we reap from that he's a loudest car a lot of headache a lot of gray hair a lot of bumping here and there before we can figure it out in the right way but father your children were not meant to live like that your words say that you sent your word to heal them and now you are coming to reveal the very purpose that you sent all of us here on this Earth we have a specific mission we have a specific purpose we have a specific plan we have a specific project we have wasted so much time we have turned around this mountain so much until we forget that the destination was the Promised Land a destination that could take three days you have taken 40 years father may you be merciful to us may you be merciful to each person here and those that are streaming and those that I will Stream So that each one will receive their personal revelation of the purpose that you send them in this world and may father you give each person the ability to be able to surrender their own thoughts their own thinking they're all proud their own agenda and father to begin to rely on the mind of Christ and to give way to the mind of Christ to be able to operate the will of God in our life because it's not up to us to implement it it is not up to us to put it to work it is not up to us to bring it to pass all that you are requiring from us is what you require for Mary is just to obey and to accept it and to say be unto me just like Peter could say at that word may each one of us surrender ourselves and let the will of God so that the stroke will be easy so that the Yoke won't be a burden so that the moving won't be a
