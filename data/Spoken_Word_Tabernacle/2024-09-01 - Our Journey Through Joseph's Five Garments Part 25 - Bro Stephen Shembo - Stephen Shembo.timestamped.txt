[43:26] just leave it alone Al amen it's good to
[43:29] see everybody so tomorrow by the grace
[43:32] of God somebody will get a day off so
[43:34] you will have plenty of time to go and
[43:36] sleep and relax and spend some good
[43:39] quality family time by God's grace amen
[43:43] so we greet you in the precious name of
[43:45] our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ both
[43:49] visible and invisible audience amen I I
[43:52] tell you you got a big invisible
[43:54] audience you got a big church more than
[43:57] and what we have here and when you
[43:59] travel you find invisible audience
[44:01] people the brother St I don't even know
[44:03] them all I know his brother they are and
[44:06] and they just look at you they five
[44:08] Garment of J so they
[44:10] [Laughter]
[44:14] ride so it seems like everywhere I'm
[44:17] traveling I meet invisible audience I
[44:19] was in Kentucky and I meet the young men
[44:21] they came I didn't even know them they
[44:23] say can we take a picture I say Lord I
[44:25] don't even know where my picture is
[44:27] going they say we follow you I say oh
[44:30] God so you got a big church brothers and
[44:34] sisters
[44:35] somewhere amen people of like Precious
[44:38] Faith amen you know brother Abraham told
[44:41] me something he said brother Steven you
[44:42] won't know some of them until you get to
[44:44] heaven and he said because what happened
[44:47] some of them don't really subscribe but
[44:51] they just download the link I mean uh
[44:54] the the link and then they keep sharing
[44:57] the link right so he Tau me what the
[44:59] Holy Spirit brother Abraham is very very
[45:02] have a strong prophetic inside he say
[45:04] what the Lord does he uses your local
[45:07] church to stir the
[45:09] gift so when the gift is stirred the
[45:13] children of God worldwide are receiving
[45:15] what they needed so you've
[45:23] been so the credit to this ministry that
[45:27] doesn't come from me alone so it come
[45:29] from me and you because you're the one
[45:31] that make the gift
[45:34] operate so if somebody is blessed over
[45:36] there because you're saying amen because
[45:39] somebody's pulling somebody's thirsty

[50:07] chat and uh he keep pulling and pulling
[50:10] and pulling uh he he must have strong
[50:13] faith because I told him I say I can't

[50:30] again in North Carolina so everything
[50:33] went well it's brother Joe he's a pastor
[50:36] and his wife his sister Sarah they were
[50:38] so excited and that's where I got in the
[50:41] car and I met somebody from in at church
[50:43] he said brother stepen I'm so good to
[50:45] ride with you in the same car I listen
[50:47] to you all the time I'm like visible
[50:50] audence so you got more V invisible
[50:53] audience over there already because they
[50:55] didn't want me to come back
[51:02] I thought the it's it's Labor Day
[51:05] weekend I thought the brother I have
[51:09] more excited stuff coming up I told the
[51:12] brother say there was even a sister
[51:14] saying that you better come back so I
[51:17] must come back because they it's not
[51:19] going to
[51:22] work
[51:23] amen amen Oh Glory gory to God and the
[51:28] Holy Spirit was there I preach a message
[51:32] I never preached before so I'm sorry I
[51:35] told uh brother Enoch go ahead and
[51:37] download the whole sermon and put on the
[51:41] title uh the holy spirit in all aspect
[51:44] foundation and put it in the church
[51:46] group chat so the church can have it
[51:49] because I had to preach to people who
[51:50] don't know the message I have to lay the
[51:53] prophet and then uh the holy ghost
[51:55] coming together and as I was talking I
[51:58] begin to learn things myself I don't
[52:01] even
[52:06] know I never even seen that Moses was a
[52:10] shadow of Pentecost he just hit me right
[52:13] there and those things were coming right
[52:16] there I was like my God this is
[52:18] something deep and I never seen the two
[52:21] Elijah dealing with the heart on
[52:23] Redemption like that so I learned myself
[52:26] I have to sit down and begin to listen
[52:28] to the sermon myself I say my goodness
[52:30] so the Holy Spirit was gracious to open
[52:32] more than that so I thought the pastor
[52:34] you take over from here he said brother
[52:36] Steven thank you so much I said you take
[52:38] over from here so you continue to see
[52:40] it's a Boston area it's a a lot of
[52:43] intellectual people over there and uh
[52:45] and it's crazy I know what he told me
[52:47] what's going on over there it's it's
[52:49] really you are fine here in North
[52:51] Carolina the pressure that is there you
[52:53] have no clue what is going on there it
[52:56] is more pressurized than anything and
[52:59] he's there trying to out I mean doing
[53:01] Outreach Ministry and trying to pull
[53:03] people into the message so God has been
[53:05] gracious so that's why we have to travel
[53:08] that way but if you know the message
[53:10] very well even if I didn't say brother
[53:13] Bram safe if you listen very good you
[53:16] will know where it's coming
[53:17] [Applause]
[53:20] from you don't learn those things from
[53:23] theology but brother brandham said the
[53:26] problem means we present the message
[53:28] wrong so when you're talking to the
[53:30] people outside the message you need to
[53:32] go through the scripture until the Holy
[53:34] Spirit tells you what to do then you
[53:36] bring the big cannon you say God send as
[53:40] a prophet amen for Jesus Christ to
[53:44] explain
[53:45] himself Jesus explained himself through
[53:48] the
[53:50] prophet he used the prophet to explain
[53:53] himself in other word no Prophet you
[53:55] won't understand Christ
[53:57] Oh Glory Glory Glory Glory Glory to God
[54:01] Amen I'm so happy because the church is
[54:04] alive amen so you stay put because we
[54:08] got some uh big material today so even

[54:28] sure you stay under the holy spirit amen
[54:31] that's why I made that place a little
[54:33] bit
[54:34] smaller I told the Deacon so he can be
[54:36] uncomfortable so they can come back in
[54:38] church quickly because we need to train
[54:41] our children to stay in
[54:43] church amen yeah your child cannot go to
[54:46] the bathroom 10 times we need to lay
[54:49] hand on

[1:17:59] God Only God can judge the
[1:18:03] gods are we together in other words
[1:18:06] there is no one that can judge anybody
[1:18:09] who is
[1:18:11] God in other word there is no human
[1:18:15] being that can judge a
[1:18:18] god even if a God is in error
[1:18:24] [Applause]
[1:18:27] for you to judge him are we together you

[1:18:41] something bad are we together and BAC

[1:18:59] said come and curse these people because
[1:19:01] I found fault on them amen the prophet

[1:19:51] Gods Only God can judge the Gods
[1:19:55] man who say this God did something wrong
[1:19:59] but God says there is no iniquity in
[1:20:02] them and the Bible say let everybody's
[1:20:06] word be a
[1:20:08] lie only God's word be the truth so who
[1:20:13] do you listen to because no one can
[1:20:16] judge you only God what is God telling
[1:20:21] you what is your neighbor telling you
[1:20:24] what are are the young people telling
[1:20:26] you what is God telling
[1:20:30] [Music]
[1:20:33] you these Gods nobody can judge
[1:20:38] them no human being can judge them you
[1:20:41] must be God if you God you can talk to
[1:20:48] God Amen are we
[1:20:51] together don't worry my friend
[1:20:54] let me look at another scripture you
[1:20:56] will clam up with me Revelation 12:10
[1:21:00] the Bible say and I heard a loud voice
[1:21:03] saying where in heaven now is come
[1:21:06] salvation and what strength and the
[1:21:09] kingdom of our God and the power of His
[1:21:11] Christ for the
[1:21:14] accuser of our Brethren is what cast
[1:21:17] down which accuse them when for our God
[1:21:21] how day and night so the devil cannot be
[1:21:25] your
[1:21:29] judge the Bible call the devil an
[1:21:33] accuser because to be a judge you must
[1:21:36] be
[1:21:37] [Applause]
[1:21:39] God Only God can judge the
[1:21:46] gods Lord help me the devil according to
[1:21:50] the scripture he is called an accuser
[1:21:54] right an accuser doesn't
[1:21:57] [Music]
[1:22:01] judge the
[1:22:03] devil is an
[1:22:05] accuser amen an accuser doesn't judge an
[1:22:10] accuser only bring
[1:22:12] fact amen but the one who judge is
[1:22:19] God Amen so no matter what the devil
[1:22:23] accuses you
[1:22:26] [Applause]
[1:22:29] of doing all have done in the
[1:22:34] past the last verdict will never come
[1:22:38] from the
[1:22:40] devil in other words when Satan talk to
[1:22:44] you just remember whatever he's telling
[1:22:48] you is not def F of
[1:22:50] judgment it's only accusation
[1:22:59] amen amen amen the judge is
[1:23:04] God let me continue further in 1 John
[1:23:07] Chapter 2 verse1 the Bible say my little
[1:23:11] children John these things right I unto
[1:23:14] you that you do what John don't want you
[1:23:17] to sin but and if any man what
[1:23:23] s we have what
[1:23:26] Advocate an advocate with the father who
[1:23:30] is The Advocate Jesus Christ the
[1:23:33] what so your God who is the
[1:23:39] judge is also your
[1:23:46] Advocate are we together so when the
[1:23:49] devil accuses you God defend you
[1:23:57] God plead for you in other word the
[1:24:00] devil cannot have answer toward your
[1:24:03] life until he deal with God two
[1:24:10] ways he must deal with God as a lawyer
[1:24:16] first but God is not the lawyer of the
[1:24:20] devil he is your lawyer and when he
[1:24:24] finish talking to God as a lawyer God
[1:24:27] change and become a
[1:24:29] [Applause]
[1:24:33] judge how can your lawyer condemn
[1:24:39] you in other word there is no
[1:24:43] case that the devil can bring before God
[1:24:47] about you and succeed
[1:24:50] [Applause]
[1:24:55] because the devil to begin with cannot
[1:24:57] judge you you can only judge by
[1:25:01] God and to defend you it takes only God
[1:25:05] to defend
[1:25:09] you are we together remember the devil
[1:25:12] is not a
[1:25:13] Creator only people who create hand the
[1:25:16] staff of people who
[1:25:20] creat only God Hand the God if you don't
[1:25:24] create yet you already in a different
[1:25:25] category in other don't worry my friend
[1:25:30] let's continue the Bible says this in
[1:25:32] Roman
[1:25:33] 8:31 he said what shall we then say to
[1:25:37] these things if God be for what
[1:25:45] us if God is your judge and your lawyer
[1:25:51] and he is for you
[1:25:56] now you begin to understand the Bible
[1:25:58] say who can be how against
[1:26:04] us amen Roman
[1:26:08] 8:33 who shall lay what anything to the
[1:26:12] charge of what God's elect it is God
[1:26:15] that do what judges because it's God who
[1:26:18] is the
[1:26:21] judge justify brother Bram say you never
[1:26:24] done
[1:26:25] it so regardless of how much the devil
[1:26:28] talk you need to know who you listening
[1:26:33] to are you listening to God or are you
[1:26:36] listening to the devil the judge is not
[1:26:39] the devil the judge is God and whatever
[1:26:43] God say is
[1:26:45] correct but it looks like the accuser
[1:26:48] have more success than the
[1:26:52] judge praise God amen who is he that do
[1:26:56] what commend condemneth it is Christ
[1:26:59] that did what die where he paid the
[1:27:02] price that is what risen again who is
[1:27:05] even at the right hand of God who also
[1:27:07] maketh what intercessions for us
[1:27:11] amen he's the one that judges he's the
[1:27:15] one that is your lawyer he's the one
[1:27:17] that make intercession for you and no
[1:27:20] one can judge you only God but you can
[1:27:24] judge
[1:27:26] everybody the Bible said the saint will
[1:27:28] judge the
[1:27:31] Earth why are you going to sit on the
[1:27:33] throne of God to do
[1:27:36] what to judge
[1:27:39] who amen you can judge all things amen
[1:27:44] but no one can judge you that no one
[1:27:47] means no human
[1:27:49] being can judge
[1:27:52] you your friend cannot judge you there
[1:27:56] is no preacher in this message that can
[1:28:00] tell you you are not
[1:28:04] brother there is no one in this message
[1:28:08] that can tell you you are off the mercy
[1:28:10] of God
[1:28:13] hallelujah only God can do
[1:28:15] [Applause]
[1:28:17] that don't worry my friend we are
[1:28:20] claming together let's go to verse seven
[1:28:26] God judges among the gods only God
[1:28:30] judges this
[1:28:31] creature the Bible say in verse six I
[1:28:35] have
[1:28:36] said ye are Gods we found out that there
[1:28:40] is amnesia
[1:28:42] there amen verse six there is amnesia
[1:28:46] amen the children of God don't know that
[1:28:49] they are God so God is reminding them
[1:28:51] that ye are God are we together amen he
[1:28:54] says that I have said ye are
[1:28:59] gods and all of you are children of the
[1:29:04] most high amen am
[1:29:08] but you shall die like men
[1:29:13] amen these
[1:29:15] Gods amen these children of the most
[1:29:19] high
[1:29:20] God
[1:29:22] Amen oh glory to God have a problem with
[1:29:30] death because they
[1:29:33] mortal amen but what I'm trying to
[1:29:36] highlight here they have a problem with
[1:29:38] death are we
[1:29:40] together there but you shall die like
[1:29:44] men and
[1:29:47] fall like one of the princes so they got
[1:29:50] a problem with death and fall
[1:29:57] amen when you look at these two words
[1:30:00] death and
[1:30:01] fall amen he reminders of
[1:30:10] Eden are we there because the fall
[1:30:13] happen in
[1:30:15] Eden that's why God said the day you eat
[1:30:17] there of that day you will
[1:30:20] die are we together so this Gods here
[1:30:25] are
[1:30:26] affected with something that started in
[1:30:33] Eden amen why Eden because in Eden there
[1:30:38] was no
[1:30:39] death in Eden there was no fa in Eden
[1:30:44] everything was perfect in Eden Man was
[1:30:48] created in the image and the likeness of
[1:30:52] God in
[1:30:54] man was God remember we already went
[1:30:57] there Adam in Eden was a God so God is
[1:31:02] saying that this creature has been
[1:31:05] affected with something that happened in
[1:31:07] Eden it looks like whatever started in
[1:31:10] Eden is keep going on and on and on and
[1:31:14] on and on until the gods lost the
[1:31:19] [Music]
[1:31:20] identity are we together then God comes
[1:31:24] back and say ye are Gods I know in other
[1:31:27] word ye are Gods but I know that you are
[1:31:31] affected with what happened in
[1:31:36] Eden are we together are we together jum
[1:31:40] to verse eight the Bible say we have not
[1:31:43] read verse eight yet arise oh God and do
[1:31:48] what judge the Earth so God verse
[1:31:55] seven verse six amen it's about these
[1:32:00] are Gods
[1:32:03] identity we clear verse seven it's about
[1:32:08] what happened in
[1:32:10] Eden what happened in Eden affect us
[1:32:14] amen then on verse eight the Bible say
[1:32:20] AAS amen if AAS then
[1:32:24] arise
[1:32:26] who arise who who's going to arise God
[1:32:30] Arise oh God if you tell God to arise so

[1:32:40] together if you say arise oh God so God

[1:32:44] seated are we together so God will move
[1:32:48] from his seat to do what judge judge so
[1:32:52] God will as to be a judge so these
[1:32:57] scriptures speak of the second
[1:33:00] [Applause]
[1:33:01] [Music]
[1:33:03] coming of Jesus Christ because Jesus on
[1:33:07] the second coming he's not coming as a
[1:33:10] lamb he's coming as a lion the lion of
[1:33:14] the tribe of Judah he's coming as a
[1:33:19] judge are we together are we together
[1:33:23] are we together
[1:33:27] the Bible says arise oh God to do what
[1:33:31] judge he's Rising as the judge of the
[1:33:35] earth it's a second coming of Christ
[1:33:38] amen a rise oh judge judge oh God judge
[1:33:43] the Earth for you shall inherit all what
[1:33:49] nations before God inherit All Nation
[1:33:54] follow me carefully he must judge the
[1:33:58] Earth are we together but the
[1:34:01] inheritance of All
[1:34:04] Nation
[1:34:06] amen speak of the
[1:34:12] Millennium amen so let me quien you your
[1:34:17] nerve a little bit because uh I don't
[1:34:20] want somebody to get uh lost the Bible
[1:34:23] say says in Roman 8 there is therefore
[1:34:26] now no what condemnation to them which
[1:34:29] are in Christ who walk not after the
[1:34:32] flesh but after the spirit for the law
[1:34:35] of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus
[1:34:37] has made us free from the law of what
[1:34:40] sin and death so there is a law of sin
[1:34:42] and death the law of sin and death and
[1:34:48] this is what brother Bram says so you
[1:34:50] get this clearly brother Bram said law
[1:34:54] of sin and death I was set free from it
[1:34:57] you once you were once bound there you
[1:35:00] see but now you are free from that as I
[1:35:03] said this morning death only abids in
[1:35:06] Sin Sin and death is what the same
[1:35:09] because the death is the wages of sin
[1:35:12] but when you are away from sin you are
[1:35:15] away from death but while you are in sin
[1:35:18] you are in death see and therefore when
[1:35:21] you are free from the law of sin and
[1:35:23] death you are a new creature in Christ
[1:35:26] Jesus and then you are free now coming
[1:35:29] back to inherit All Nation brother Bram
[1:35:32] says this in the message Elijah he says
[1:35:35] over in the Book of Revelation when John
[1:35:38] the Revelator saw that Christ was
[1:35:41] falling air to it he said rejoice in ye
[1:35:46] heaven and all ye Earth for the kingdom
[1:35:49] of this world has what become has become
[1:35:53] some somebody's inheriting has become
[1:35:56] the kingdom of our Lord and of his Crist
[1:36:00] and he will rule and Reign How many
[1:36:03] years a thousand years which is the
[1:36:05] Millennium on the earth now we are
[1:36:08] looking for that great what millennium
[1:36:11] day the time when all the trouble and Dr
[1:36:14] and everything will be how settled
[1:36:17] brother Bram says here Jesus knowed he
[1:36:20] will fall head to them where in the
[1:36:23] millennium because the devil call him
[1:36:25] and show him everything and say I'm
[1:36:28] going to give you all this Kingdom if
[1:36:29] you can Bow Down and Worship and Christ
[1:36:32] refused brother Bram said the reason why
[1:36:33] Jesus refused is because he knew that
[1:36:36] somehow he's going to inherit all of
[1:36:39] them inherit all of them where in the
[1:36:43] millennium are we together brother Bram
[1:36:46] say because Jesus know he fall air to
[1:36:49] them when in the Millennium so he said
[1:36:52] get the hands what
[1:36:54] he knew that God will give him all of
[1:36:57] the kingdom and they will be his and
[1:37:00] they shall all be one Kingdom so coming
[1:37:04] back to deep Psalm in verse six we are
[1:37:08] Gods because of a problem with identity
[1:37:11] in verse seven something started in Eden
[1:37:15] that is still has been
[1:37:17] perpetuated in verse 8 then God will
[1:37:21] arise to judge the Earth which which is
[1:37:23] speaking about the second coming and
[1:37:26] then he will also inherit all nation
[1:37:29] which talk about the Millennium because
[1:37:32] after the coming of the Lord Jesus
[1:37:34] Christ then we go through the
[1:37:35] tribulation and then the Millennium come
[1:37:38] in other words this prophecy of Psalm 82
[1:37:43] is a prophecy of the end
[1:37:47] [Applause]
[1:37:49] time are we together it's a prophecy
[1:37:53] that will happen before the second
[1:37:56] coming of Jesus
[1:38:00] Christ are we together are we together
[1:38:04] before Jesus Christ come and judge this
[1:38:09] Earth and bring us into the Millennium
[1:38:13] sons of God that have been affected by
[1:38:17] their fall of Adam must be
[1:38:21] free from death and the fall and must
[1:38:25] come to their own identity as
[1:38:29] Gods as long as we are not Gods we
[1:38:33] cannot go and rule in a millennium amen
[1:38:36] that's
[1:38:38] why eus was never promis a
[1:38:42] throne SM was never promis a throne only
[1:38:46] the last age of the Gentile the Bible
[1:38:49] say in the last stage which is the age
[1:38:52] of laia to to whom that will overcome
[1:38:55] there I will make him sit on the throne
[1:38:58] because the one who sit on the throne
[1:39:00] must be God to rule and reign in the
[1:39:04] Millennium so this prophecy here belong
[1:39:07] to this
[1:39:11] time are we together are we together
[1:39:14] Paul could not fulfill this prophecy am
[1:39:19] the only one who spoke about it is Jesus
[1:39:21] Christ after Jesus cross everybody
[1:39:25] hash because it's for the end time
[1:39:28] because after this prophecy is fulfilled
[1:39:32] that the that the children of God
[1:39:34] recognize that they are Gods what follow
[1:39:37] is God will
[1:39:39] rise as the lion and come in the second
[1:39:42] coming to come and go ahead and judge
[1:39:45] the Earth are we together and after that
[1:39:48] we go into the Millennium it's a
[1:39:51] prophecy that concern the seveny
[1:39:54] because the seven seal is what bring
[1:39:56] chist down on earth and the Seven seal
[1:39:59] areer in the
[1:40:01] Millennium you cannot have Christ
[1:40:03] without the seven SE and you won't have
[1:40:06] the Millennium without the seven and the
[1:40:09] God won't be God without the
[1:40:12] seven because when the that's why in
[1:40:15] Revelation 10 the book of redemption
[1:40:19] that was taken by God he sent back again
[1:40:22] because Adam is back gods are back we
[1:40:27] are restored Back to Eden you can
[1:40:30] receive the book of redemption and begin
[1:40:33] to do what Adam
[1:40:35] did and when you do that then Jesus will
[1:40:39] come as a church and then from there we
[1:40:41] go into the
[1:40:43] millennium are we
[1:40:46] together are we together keep your seat
[1:40:49] belt we on a bumy road my friend as we
[1:40:52] keep climbing let's go to the Book of
[1:40:54] Luke chapter
[1:41:00] 15 the scripture hold more than what you
[1:41:03] see with your
[1:41:04] eyes and if you look always between the
[1:41:07] scripture there is a a a white uh a
[1:41:10] white
[1:41:17] color there is a white color between the
[1:41:19] scripture amen
[1:41:24] if you dare you can say amen and those
[1:41:27] white color between the scripture it's
[1:41:29] stuff between the
[1:41:36] lines I can't hear you
[1:41:39] honey I can't hear you Second Coming
[1:41:42] second
[1:41:44] coming I say second coming it's
[1:41:46] [Laughter]
[1:41:50] there amen glory to God you know in the
[1:41:55] vision of Junior Jackson that's right do
[1:41:58] you know everything the the mountain was
[1:42:02] written and when the mountain was
[1:42:04] written on the top when they cut the
[1:42:06] rock they open it there was a rock there
[1:42:09] and nothing was written there but there
[1:42:11] were stuff written
[1:42:14] there that's why the Bible have a stuff
[1:42:18] I mean a space that is notar written and
[1:42:20] a space that is written because brother
[1:42:22] Bram say that Mountain was the
[1:42:25] Bible so when you open the Bible you
[1:42:28] will see scripture but in between
[1:42:30] scripture there is a white space the
[1:42:32] white space is the message of brother
[1:42:36] BR the white space that you see in the
[1:42:39] Bible it's the message of brother BR
[1:42:42] that's why this scripture when we
[1:42:43] continue to peel him off we see things
[1:42:45] laying under you didn't know that AO God
[1:42:49] means the second coming he was right
[1:42:51] there but he was already closed
[1:42:53] but because the seal was broken and the
[1:42:56] Seven Seal The Rock was open now we can
[1:42:59] see what is in the Rock and bring the
[1:43:02] interpretation of the unwritten
[1:43:05] word but if you open it it will never
[1:43:08] contradict the Bible because it's coming
[1:43:10] from the space of the Bible that's why
[1:43:13] you heard brother Bram say reading
[1:43:15] between the when you look in your Bible
[1:43:18] between the landine it's white that's
[1:43:21] right there are stuff written there
[1:43:24] [Laughter]
[1:43:27] let's go to Luke chap 15:
[1:43:30] 10 if you thereare you can say amen amen
[1:43:34] don't pull me toward the seven seal my
[1:43:37] friend ver the Bible say likewise I say
[1:43:40] unto you there is joy in the what the
[1:43:43] presence of of what of the angels of the
[1:43:46] angels of God over one what sinner that
[1:43:50] do what repent so if a sinner repent
[1:43:54] there is a feast among the
[1:43:59] angel one sinner sh one sinner repenting
[1:44:04] shake the Angels
[1:44:07] sh and you want to be like a
[1:44:11] servant you want to be like an angel
[1:44:15] remember Solomon do you remember Solomon
[1:44:18] you remember this in ecclesiast Solomon
[1:44:21] say I have seen who
[1:44:23] upon horses and prin doing what walking
[1:44:26] a servant upon what the Earth he didn't
[1:44:29] say that the princes were
[1:44:32] servant they are working as servant so
[1:44:36] when they work you look at them they
[1:44:38] work is like a walk of a
[1:44:42] servant but they are princes if you ask
[1:44:45] them you look he's a prince but his
[1:44:50] mentality his morale is the mentality of
[1:44:54] a servant and that mentality so strong
[1:44:57] on him until he begin to work behave
[1:45:01] like a servant while he's a
[1:45:05] prince but when one of those repent
[1:45:09] servant begin to
[1:45:15] Rejoice job to verse2 my friend and the
[1:45:18] younger one of them say to his father

[1:56:18] second
[1:56:21] part with together we together verse 22
[1:56:25] but in other way the contradiction Rose

[1:56:34] Express the last
[1:56:38] sentence verify in your Bible my friend

[1:57:33] servant the voice of God interrupted
[1:57:37] him are we together are we together are

[1:58:24] father sto him first and then before he
[1:58:28] say make me like the servant the father
[1:58:30] turned to the servant in other word
[1:58:33] daddy caught the unspoken
[1:58:38] [Music]
[1:58:39] part are you following me are you
[1:58:43] following me he CAU the outspoken part
[1:58:46] because the child already put himself as
[1:58:48] a servant so Daddy went straight where
[1:58:51] the problem is and
[1:58:55] [Applause]
[1:58:56] busted and busted that judgment because
[1:59:00] he's the one to judge it is not you that
[1:59:03] make the Judgment Only God can judge
[1:59:09] [Applause]

[1:59:27] gods amen only the big God judge
[1:59:33] gods do you follow me in other word you

[1:59:59] [Applause]
[2:00:01] [Music]
[2:00:04] judgment are we together are we together
[2:00:08] so the first one Ur repentance as soon
[2:00:11] as he begin to deviate God interrupted
[2:00:13] him like on more
[2:00:16] Transfiguration when Peter begin to
[2:00:18] deviate brother Bram said the voice
[2:00:21] interrupted him and say hey Peter he him
[2:00:26] in other word you going to introduce
[2:00:27] something bad you are introducing
[2:00:30] denomination
[2:00:32] again son you started very good you
[2:00:36] already repented for your sin now why
[2:00:39] are you building up a complex I can't

[2:01:14] him are we together are we together
[2:01:19] let's go to verse 22 and but and
[2:01:22] contradiction the father say to him he
[2:01:25] says
[2:01:26] what bring forth the
[2:01:29] what
[2:01:31] hallu somebody called it the father
[2:01:35] didn't say bring the
[2:01:40] Rob and the father never say bring the
[2:01:43] best of the
[2:01:47] robes so in that house there was one Rob
[2:01:54] I'm reading the Bible my friend I have
[2:01:56] not even stopped preaching in that house
[2:01:59] there was only one robe that everybody
[2:02:01] knew that he was the best robe because
[2:02:05] for you to send angelu for you to send
[2:02:08] servant to go pick up the best robe the
[2:02:11] servant must know which one is the
[2:02:16] best oh spoken word maybe when that robe
[2:02:21] was
[2:02:23] purchase people were asking Master is
[2:02:25] this for you he said
[2:02:27] no say h such a good suit like this such
[2:02:31] an expensive suit for who
[2:02:34] no maybe the son came and said Daddy is
[2:02:37] that suit for me no
[2:02:40] am are we together are we together I
[2:02:44] don't know how many
[2:02:46] years he left the father home before he
[2:02:50] come maybe a d time he was smaller than
[2:02:54] the
[2:02:59] robe
[2:03:00] so so he need to take some time and grow
[2:03:04] up so by the time he's coming the Rob
[2:03:08] will fit
[2:03:10] [Applause]
[2:03:13] him are we together are we together and
[2:03:17] not only bring the RO but bring the best
[2:03:20] Ro amen the best Rob is only given to
[2:03:24] the best
[2:03:28] [Applause]
[2:03:32] person follow me
[2:03:35] carefully sister jerusa have made a
[2:03:37] wedding in Sister jerusha's wedding you

[2:03:58] they want to see they say not keep
[2:03:59] moving forward and they're going to put
[2:04:01] him in a certain place so the place
[2:04:04] depend on who that person
[2:04:09] is if the son have to be given the best
[2:04:13] rob it means that son was the best so
[2:04:17] the best for God doesn't mean you never

[2:25:01] Paul when he talk you will recognize him
[2:25:04] by the
[2:25:07] guiltiness you will recognize him by the
[2:25:10] complex that's Paul the human being Paul
[2:25:14] the human being will always be complex
[2:25:17] when he saw Peter he will be complex
[2:25:20] because he did something wrong to the
[2:25:21] church that's one Paul but and another

[2:28:07] Glory GL time gone he says but I labor
[2:28:11] more abundantly than what they are yet
[2:28:14] not to who I but what the grace of God
[2:28:18] which was what with me it was not me
[2:28:21] working there was a God in

[2:38:04] try to point us about a failure try to
[2:38:07] point us about a weakness try to point
[2:38:09] us about a situation that we have been
[2:38:11] praying for years and we have not gotten
