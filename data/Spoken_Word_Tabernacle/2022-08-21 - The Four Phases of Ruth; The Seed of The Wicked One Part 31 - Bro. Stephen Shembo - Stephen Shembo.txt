wonderful if you miss it there is nothing else i can do just find whoever was there let them do yours to you everything that was given yesterday which is impossible amen unless they were really recording but nobody records i don't want it to go worldwide amen remember our wedding shower for sister rebecca you know the day it is gonna be a sister kelly's home so make sure we make it really

you start fasting because i will be sitting with you and we're gonna talk face to face if you start fasting amen so do to other what you want people to do amen so make sure we make it special make it good this is our first one amen no jealousy nothing going on you support it pretty good and god will remember you and he will open the door for you amen you're going to wake up don't worry oh my god let's go to our scripture this morning genesis chapter 2. if you missed it yesterday you need a very real pretty good attention because somebody is ahead of you if you dare you can say amen we announced these things like a month ago and still somebody misses it one month still somebody misses it except you have a legitimate reason but you should not because you have one month to prepare these are stuff of the kingdom one of these days they will shut down everything that you have and you will remember god amen don't wait like other people have a tendency they only get closer to god where things are going wrong in the life and once things begin to get relaxed then the rights again then they go back if you see them in church you know that something is wrong in their lives as soon as everything is resolved they run away they don't have time for anything they can put everything in front of god's things it's only a church time that they have to do this they have to do this they have to do this only on wednesday night that's when they're going to do this this this only when we have this that's when we plan this and this and this don't be don't stop stop doing that the time is gone amen genesis chapter 2 if you're not doing that you say amen genesis chapter 2 verse 16. if you do you can say amen i don't want to face god with your blood in my hand no i want to go home peacefully [Music] everybody okay verse 16. brother caleb if you can work on it i don't know where it's coming from and the lord god commanded the man he remembered this yesterday saying of every tree of the garden don't forget i needed a little bit too of every tree of the garden you may freely eat you may be seated so the commandment god gave to adam amen is to eat everything that is eatable eat of every tree and we know that among the trees we have natural trees you remember that were there for natural food and we also have a spiritual tree amen that was the tree of life which we know was who christ amen you can eat everything so men have an access to the tree of life freely given to him because men men shall not live by but by every everybody okay verse 17 but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil you shall not eat of it for in the day that you shall eat thereof you shall die you shall surely die it is clear so there is another tree here which is the tree of the knowledge of good and evil amen if you touch this tree it's guaranteed 100 guaranteed you will surely die amen so it's a tree of death which we know that was who lucifer satan everybody okay praise be to the name of god verse 18 and the lord god say it is not good that man should be alone in other words when this commandment was given eve was not there did you see eve here because adam was still alone it was adam who preached to eve the gospel everybody okay the husband your husband your husband that you praying god for that man that you dreaming all the time must be able to teach you the word am i okay am i okay your husband must be able to open the scripture home and tell you about the message if your husband doesn't tell you about the message he need to go back in the scripture that's why you need to be more working double you get me you need to work double you need to take note because you're going to sit with a woman at home that would be looking at you and say i do not understand this [Music] you don't get me matter of fact the bible says if a woman doesn't understand something in church she need to go back home and ask her husband the husband doesn't read the message the husband doesn't listen to the team the husband doesn't want to read the cod book what are you going to teach teach politics teach facebook or teach about what tesla is doing or what cadillac brand is coming up i'm a man i'm a man i'm a man there is more that goes with a man man is not the head head head head the head means responsibility [Music] you don't even know how to pray if we put you here and just give you the microphone pray for the sick you'll see how you're struggling you don't even remember verses for you to be able to pray good you must know the word because when you pray in god god is not impressed with your feeling god is not impressed with your talking god is impressed by his word remind him his word he is impressed by what he already spoke what are you pressing god for you know papa god are you a good god he already is a good god remind him you say you said in your word isaiah said moses saved that's why i'm coming [Music] glory to god amen brother stephen preach [Music] god give you a heart potato my friend you got to deal with me all the way to the rapture let's go to genesis uh chapter 2 still verse 18 and the lord god said it is not good that the man shall be alone i will make him a help meet for him when god was creating everything it was good it was good it was good this is the first time it was not good that's where the trouble started we okay job two verse uh 24. i just want to say something there the bible says therefore is not there on the board shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall cling to his wife and there shall be one flesh in other words eve and adam were married god married them the first marriage that was performed in a bible it was god himself who married the people god pick his daughter and bring him to the altar and he posed his daughter and he went to the pulpit and blessed them amen okay verse 25 and they were both naked the man and his wife and they were not ashamed they were married but the marriage was no longer consumed it was no not yet consumed so what i'm trying to point out there is the woman we call her the woman here we know down the road she changed into eve the woman was a married woman amen as soon as god created eve automatically he took eve and hook her in marriage why why he didn't give eve some time why he didn't give eve some time like no you go ahead and spend some time as soon as you come up god look he's saying [Music] stay with adam there is a reason why not today down the road everybody care let's go to chapter three amen verse one if you dare you can say amen you know what it means now the bible says and now the serpent i'm sorry was more sadder you know what subtility means now remember we know what it means right there is one more subtlety i have let me see if i can touch it today now the serpent was more sadder than any beast of the field you understand now which the lord god has made and he said to the woman yea has god say you shall not eat of every tree of the garden amen did god say every tree god spoke only one tree but he doesn't touch the tree he goes generally you point him he start general i've heard that there is something going on like he doesn't know what he's talking about [Music] that's the devil he acts like he doesn't know maybe let me ask a question so god said you shall not itch off any tree in the garden is that what god say you see verse two and the woman said to the serpent we may eat now the woman now is showing that she was taught by adam you may eat of the fruit of the tree of the garden everybody you but the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden god has said you shall not eat of it neither shall you water did god use the word touch because when you speak to somebody the first time when god speak everybody okay god speak directly but when the preacher takes what god spoke and expanded to the church the church began to have more understanding of what god spoke is it okay in other words when god spoke to adam god used the word eat god to adam god used the word eat amen but when adam the preacher took the word eat and broke it down to eve to the woman everybody okay the woman came up with the understanding that eat keep on moving you're coming up somebody's waking up now it is the same as what that's why you need the firefall ministry [Music] anybody okay anybody okay anybody okay if you don't have a firefox ministry you'll be stuck here it is the minister that break it down this and this don't contradict it just help you understand more you say eat touch for you mentally speaking it's different what is even eating is touching is that's what you think let's move forward amen god has said you shall not eat of it neither shall you touch it unless you do what so eating and touches bring you to death update amen glory to god verse 4 and the serpent said to the woman you shall not remember god says surely die watch you remember yesterday the serpent the serpent say you shall not surely everybody okay surely die surely die is correct if you were there yesterday the only difference between the speech of the devil and the speech of the devil and the speech of god is the word when the devil say to eve you shall surely not what is he doing okay job to verse five why what does it mean you shall not surely die verse uh verse 5 for god knows everybody clear in the days you eat thereof then your what the devil is pointing the eating i'm going slowly he's connected to the eyes everybody okay the day that you shall eat thereof then your eyes shall be opened the opening of the eyes amen and you shall be like who knowing good and what you shall be your eye when you eat number one your eyes are open number two you shall be like god in the sense that you begin to know you remember yesterday good and what they were already god remember yesterday but they lack the knowledge of good and evil everybody okay so the devil told them that if you eat of this tree you will add the missing knowledge everybody here that god has but you don't that missing knowledge is the knowledge of good and water we already validated this one yesterday amen job two verse six and when the woman so we okay this is evil responses when the woman the first thing that open up is her sight i amen before anything started before anything started she first saw when the woman saw everybody clear that the tree was good for food so the tree is no longer bad god say if you eat it you're gonna die it means it's a bad thing anybody care but the devil turn it to be a good thing anybody okay praise god and that it is pleasant to the water everybody okay you bring pleasure to the eye i can enter many domains right here amen come up and a tree to be water so this tree when eve detected that he causes desire am i reading a different bible are we reading a different bible if satan only say you shall surely you shall not surely die when you eat your eyes will be and you'll be like that's what satan said that's it but when the message of satan we okay arrive into eve that message begin to affect the eyes of evil we okay and it begin to cause some desire in evil are we okay you heard only are we okay all right let's go verse six and when the woman saw this is the effect of the message after she received it that the tree was good for food and that it was pleasant to the eyes come on and a tree to be to make one water so there is a wisdom there everybody okay to make one wise it is causing desire and history according to eve it can give you wisdom which wisdom is this remember on wednesday how many wisdom do we have praise god to make one wise she took off the fruit when she checked these three things it is one then two then three everybody okay after she got one two three that was it everybody okay she took off the fruit thereof and did what and gave also to her husband she was a married woman remember that she didn't give it to a boyfriend no to a husband to her husband with her and he did what it and the eyes of both of them were open the eyes of eve was already open remember the eyes of both of them were open and they knew that they were naked and they saw fig leaves together and made themselves water apron jump to verse 15 and i will put enmity between you and the woman between the serpent and the woman amen between you and the woman and between your seed and her seed so the serpent has a seed and the woman has a seed we need to find out what are those seeds amen and her seed and it shall bruise your head and you shall bruise his heel any questions so far praise god let's go to matthew 13. let me are you still in genesis 2 3 jump to verse 16. it just pop up the bible say to the woman he said i will greatly multiply your sorrow and your water how can somebody eat the fruit eat an apple and you are attacking her conception [Music] what do you want me to anoint you to see [Music] amen if she ate she uses her mouth they need to curse the mouth why are they crossing the womb what is the connection between the mouth and the womb can't you see [Music] i will multiply your conception in sorrow you shall bring forth water and your water watch the board and your water [Music] you okay your desire will go to let's go now to matthew 13. we okay remember eve the woman ate first then she went and gave it to her husband she didn't go the next day the baba didn't say and the next day she went as soon as she forget she went to her husband there is a timing problem there let's go to matthew chapter 13. if you're there you can say amen verse 24 glory to god another parable put he forth to them saying the kingdom of heaven is likened to a man which saw good seed in his field so [Laughter] so there is a man not on the field and in this field the man put his seed there amen good sin but he was not really the man he was the you can work on this my brother i don't know what's going on amen the kingdom as a man who saw good seed in his field verse 25 but while the one man slept if you look another translation it means that by that night when the workers went to sleep let's help this man took his worker they went to his field and they put seed there everybody okay amen that was during the day during the day you don't go to your garden at night putting seed [Music] everybody okay but at night so the interval is not far away everybody okay at night so it's only hours difference somebody came and began to put wrong seed not in a different field [Music] anybody okay let me see where we are all right not in a different field amen so two people two people a man and mr x are using the same field the man has a seed mr x also have a seed they are using the same field but they are sowing seed at difference interval [Music] everybody okay but one man slap his enemy so mr x is an enemy he's an enemy to mix to the man we need to know who is this man and who is the enemy amen the enemy come and saw tears among the wheat and went his way but when the blood was sprung up and brought forth fruit then appeared the tears also in other words the fruit came at the same time so they were sown within a short interval that's why both of them are coming everybody okay everybody okay so this field brought twins yes [Music] this field brought the wheat and the tears and both of them came at the same time in other words they were both at the same time [Music] you should be able to already get the sermon [Music] everybody okay but when verse 26 the bread was sprung up and brought for fruit then appeared the tear also so both of them were birthed at the same time so the servant of the household of the householder came and said to him sir did not use so good seed in your field from where then has he tears he said to them an enemy has done this the servant said to him will you then that we go and gather them up let's stop there let's go to second corinthians then we pray in eden the commandment was eat everything do not touch the tree of the knowledge of good and evil because it's death as you're flipping your bible we're dealing with a married woman if god to adam say eat but to eve it means not only eat it means eat and touch the serpent say or just added one word not surely die what does it mean he says when you eat your eyes are open and you will know good and evil the woman says as soon as she gathered the message is transferred decoded in a woman opening giving pleasure to the eyes causing desires and then making one wise there is a seed there there is a seed there according to matthew 1 field twins wheat and tears planted by two people second corinthians chapter 11 verse 13 if you're there you can say amen for such as our false apostle deceitful worker transforming themselves into the apostles of what and no matter for satan himself is transformed into an angel of water so you need to be very careful if you're waiting for satan to come with big horn like this and looking scary like halloween stuff they know you're not gonna cope with halloween they know that for sure amen therefore it is no great thing if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness whose end shall be according to their work so the apostle of satan and satan himself and the ministers of satan they can change form but you gotta know how to decode them amen now let's pray heavenly father lord we are approaching you again humbly this morning father thanking you for your grace for your love and your mercy and for everything you have been doing for us father this is as far as a man can go when you give him an ability but when he comes lord father to feeding your children and to open the word into the heart of your children it takes only the supernatural work of the holy spirit father may you move me completely out of the way may you seal every demonic spirit away from this place may your children be completely free and may they enjoy the blessings of heaven be the alpha and the omega and touch those that are struggling in the body may you heal them father in the name of jesus christ amen i want to remind you again of this brother brad i'm saying scripture does not play with words whatever is in the record it's there for the anointed eyes to see it is there for a purpose everybody okay my subject this morning is the four phases of roof the seed of the wicked one we are still in the trail of the serpent the seed of the wicked one everybody okay we're still on the church in florida with ruth we still under the parable of the 10th virgin where we're dealing with the second oil and in our tabernacle we are deep in the holiest where we're dealing with roof resting everybody okay when we dealt with the parable of the tenth virgin we found out that the virgin went as they were engaged and paul was the one that stated that he have engaged or is past the bride of jesus christ but paul did not marry them because he didn't have the enough equipment to marry the brother everybody okay so far so as they were going we found out that there was a time that the virgin were sleeping they all slumbered and slept and for some reason there was a midnight cry that came in and the midnight cry unfolded the second oil amen when we dealt with the second oil we found out that the second oil was the oil that was dormant throughout the edges it is the anointing they all represent the spirit it is the holy spirit amen but this anointing was not working it was an anointing that was dormant amen but this anointing was activated by the midnight cry [Music] amen so without the midnight cry you cannot use that anointing amen it was at the time that the midnight cry came that's when the virgin realized that this first oil was already running out and they need something to supply on their lamp that's when the second one came into place amen so the midnight cry here we know that he marked the end of the first oil everybody okay now if you watch verse 6 carefully the bible says that at midnight cry there was a cry made the bible says the bible don't play with words there was a cry or you can call it a shout and the cry was made in other words this cry didn't come out by itself anybody care somebody cried [Applause] amen so they cry speak of a person [Music] everybody okay this cry is a voice everybody here so when they say the midnight cry it is not really just the cry there is somebody that is releasing the cry everybody okay everybody okay and that person is not the bridegroom [Music] you remember last night young people you remember my message [Laughter] the bible says the christ said behold the bridegroom does water so it was not the bridegroom who spoke everybody here so the cry is a person this person is different than the blood groom amen it's only a person that is introducing amen that is introducing the brethren amen so they cry the shout the voice and the person i won everybody okay let's go to genesis chapter 2 3. you see how many times you can read this parable because the scriptures have layers do you know the bologna ham they cut them in layers so you take the first one you eat there is a second way that's how the scripture works let's go to genesis chapter 3 if you dare you can say amen so when they say the midnight cry something was hidden in that scripture amen what was hidden was there was an introducer there was a messenger [Music] but when you read the bible he only said the midnight cry that's a superficial layer you need to remove the superficial layer when you look under you're gonna see there is a person when you move the layer that person is a messenger but that person is not the bridegroom but he's introducing the broad room [Music] everybody okay let's go to genesis chapter 3 go to verse 8 and they heard the voice they heard what they heard water the way our pentecostal understanding is everybody okay when they say they heard the voice you will think they were hearing let's read the bible let's the bible talk the bible says are you there genesis 3 verse 8 are you there the bible say and they heard they heard what the voiceover the voice of the lord god doing what stop have you seen my voice walking [Music] i'm reading your bible have you seen a voice like when i'm saying jesus so you see that voice working what is he saying what does he mean amen so it's not really the voice it is there [Music] so when they say the midnight cry it is not really a cry there is somebody there [Music] everybody okay the voice of the lord was walking in the garden in the cool of the day and adam and eve and his wife eve hid themselves from the water that voice was not only a voice it was a what the presence of the lord are recognized you know that sermon have you heard that servant amen so that voice was a presence a presence means there is a person there someone is there the presence of the lord god among the trees of the garden everybody here now your voice that you were thinking about is going to say verse 9 and the lord god called to adam and say to him what this is a voice too so which voice were they hearing walking now god is talking but at the beginning they heard the voice walking but the voice didn't say anything in verse 9 now the person begin to talk what i'm trying to show you is the voice and the person are let's drop to verse 10 and he said adam i heard what that voice in the water that voice he was a voice that was walking amen and i did water i was afraid because i was water and i did what how can you read from a voice the voice is coming and you're afraid of the voice and you hide yourself it is not a voice it is er let's go to revelation chapter one glory to god [Music] keep your seat below the airplane is still going this way [Music] glory to god revelation chapter one if you there you can say amen so when they say midnight cry from today know that it's just not a crime it's a person it's a midnight person there is a person that will come at midnight [Music] and he will deliver a shout out a message and that message will be to introduce the bridegroom [Applause] this voice what has the voices the voice said behold what the blood groom water was the bridegroom there so the voice the message of the voice was the bridegroom in word form do you follow me let me help you this is the announcer the introducer this is the bridegroom anybody okay this man sees the bridegroom coming and he catch the vision everybody here so there is a physical bridegroom amen and he speaks he uses his word which is his message and his message is that the bridegroom is coming his message got the bridegroom but not in physical form everybody okay his message got the broadway in word form his message got the husband in word form that's why brother branham said your husband is the revealed word [Music] everybody okay let's go to revelation chapter one if you're there you can say amen job to verse 10 hallelujah you okay are you okay somebody got it i was in the spirit this is john in the lord's day and i heard behind me a great water answer for what so what john heard was a voice did they say he hear somebody there let's see a voice saying i am alpha and water the first and the last what you see write to the book and send it to the seven church ages which are in asia and ephesus to ephesus and to smyrna and to pergamos and to tatara and to service and to philadelphia and to laodicea you ready watch verse 12 and i turn to sea water how can you see a voice how can you see a vote if i say jesus do you see anything but john said that he turned to see what and when he turned to see the voice what did he see when he turned to see the voice that spoke with me and being turned i saw what and in the midst of the seven golden candlestick lie come to the water so the verse was a person brother said revelation 1 12 he says and i turn to see the voice that spec with me and bring turn i saw seven golden candlestick john does not say that he turned to see the one whose voice he heard but he turned to see the water oh i like that why do you like it brother branham because he turned to see the water and the voice and the person are warning the water jesus is there in the beginning was the and the word was with and the word was what the same was in the beginning with god all things were made by him without him was not any things made that was made if you can ever get to really see the world you will be seeing her because jesus and his word are water the messenger and his message are water the voice and the personal water this church [Laughter] everybody okay so far everybody okay so far and then when that voice came up that voice was not the bridegroom he was the introducer of the brother he was the messenger to the brother he was the one that forerunned the forerunner of the bridegroom the pointer of the bridegroom the billboard of the bridegroom the absolute voice that will indicate you where the broad room is he was not true messenger he was not two voices it was only one voice and then one broad game everybody okay and after that voice was delivered the were generals and began to trim their lamb and for some reason that voice got quiet everybody okay because in verse 10 the bible said when they went to buy the water and they they were ready to eat water do you see the voice again talking why the voice got quiet glory to god brother branham said notice john immediately said i must i must he must water i must do what he presented the church to whom amen we are told that in the last day that will do what there is going to be air coming off that will introduce them to the water it will be in such a way they shall stand down funding like they did then he promises the next chapter of matthew on malachi tells us about it so as soon as the voice introduced the blood group the voice decreases and the bridegroom does water [Music] the bible says in the book of john let's look at this increase and decrease the bible says in the book of john that hear yourself bear witness everybody here dada said i am not what because there is a difference between the introducer and the bridegroom he said i am not the cross but i am saint water so the man that was in the midnight cry was sent before jesus christ [Music] everybody okay he that has the bread is the who the bread belongs to the husband not the messenger but the friend of the who so the announcer is a friend to the bridegroom [Music] but here he's a friend to the bathroom [Music] do you keep secret to your friend to a true friend do you keep secret you tell him everything so if he is friend with the bridegroom if you want to know the secret of the bridegroom who will tell you the secret of the bathroom who will tell you what the bridegroom likes who will tell you what he want to eat he will tell you how he wants you to dress how he wants you to walk what kind of shoes you need to wear what kind of haircut you need to have you need to be connected to the friend of the bridegroom because he knows the blood groomer we talk to the bridegroom all the time [Music] glory to god what obama the bible said but the friend of the brother which standeth and he with you rejoices greatly because of the bridegroom water [Music] this is my joy therefore is what he master by the master he that come forth from water let me continue he that cometh from above is above all he that is of the earth is what so there is two people john is saying we are two one came from above and another one came from the earth amen in other words we are two messengers two people one is heavenly and another one is we okay the bible says he that is of the earth is what and speaketh of the water but he that cometh from heaven is above so we found out that when john spoke about him decreasing and crushed increasing john open up and say we are two one of us was born from the earth and another one came from heaven when you see a combination of above of someone from heaven and someone from the earth when they join together one must decrease when divorced when the introducer of the messenger and the bridegroom meet together one must decrease [Music] but the owner of the bride is not the messenger it is the bread room so the bread room which is christmas water and the other one must water [Music] what are you trying to say brother stephen brother branham said notice malachi revelation what the what didn't the bible say now watch there was an angel in revelation 10 a messenger from he came with a book put his foot on the sea foot on the quad on the on the land and did what and roll with the thunders yes amen there was a messenger from above and enough free water so revelation 10 has two messengers we have a messenger that comes from above there was a mighty engine coming down with an open book and that angel was who and there was also an earthly messenger at their voice over there amen brother bottom say there was an angel a messenger from above and an earthly messenger and each messenger was for the age of the church brother bonham said in the days speaking now there came a ninja a messenger the word english meaning english word means a messenger he came down from heaven and he put his foot on the land and the sea and saw by him that lived forever that time shall be no more is that right a rainbow around his head and all these things just taking place that angel was who certainly but what did he say but in the days of the water so we have a heavenly angel a heavenly messenger he that is heavenly is above all but he that is from the earth is water earthly if there is of the seven angel which is the seventh the seventh church age what are you trying to say amen brother bonham say there is a messenger above always and a messenger on the water the english word angel means messenger and in the seventh angel message while he was making his proclamation revelation 10 his ministry then when he began to we begin to send forth his ministry not when he started out you remember that on sunday when he started out he was senior under the priesthood but he was not expressing the prophetic gift yet because malachi 4 have to come with the midnight cry everybody okay in the message the water brother branham says this maybe this ministry that i have tried to take people back to the world has laid out and if he has i will be leaving you for what they won't be at the same time see if it is he shall be an [Music] why did he spoke that on the servant's show why did he spoke that on the seventh year because the bridegroom came [Music] because the bridegroom came that's why they took the picture and it's the head of jesus christ the bridegroom came he's right there i must decrease and the message must be water [Music] glory to god glory to god everybody clear everybody care and if you notice are we okay if it's sunday make sure you go to bed on time okay don't be staying till two o'clock like me i went to bed around four and i'm preaching okay so don't be having your fellowship till two o'clock stop your telephone go to sleep so you don't sleep in the church everybody okay glory to god if you notice in verse 10 the bible while the bridegroom went to buy or while they went to buy the foolish virgin the bridegroom came and did they were working went into him with water to be ready we found out that you must have the second oil [Music] because he was the second one that made the wise virgin ready everybody here if you didn't have the second oil you need to go out and find some oil but when you come out that oil is not valid even if you find it it won't work anymore because they came back and the lord could not open the door everybody here so the second oil is the oil that make you ready ready what ready to meet the bridegroom [Music] if meeting the blood group and going in the marriage means the rapture which it means which it is amen so this oil are we okay royal provides you rapturing faith [Music] it's an oil of wisdom and we found out that the wisdom of god was through christ and the angel that came down was woo and the angel releases the thunders [Music] and the thunder was sealed under the seventh field everybody here so to be ready you must have rapturing faith [Music] brother branham said i have three pools he said the first pool was healing you remember the coat the second pool was water discernment and the third pool was the opening of the world they're breaking off their seals so the third blow brother branham said he opened the word it was the breaking of the seals and when they broke the seal what came out of the seal [Music] you don't want to say thunder that's your problem [Music] i am not afraid of the message of the hour i am now preaching a thunder movement but i am sovereign [Music] you keep saying sovereign what do you mean what i mean by suffering is i don't have a bishop to please i am not in the clique to be afraid of preaching certain things because it's gonna hurt my friend in the clique [Music] i will preach what will you my own blood and preach whatever the problem say i will repeat it faithfully freely suffering me [Music] if it hurt that friendship [Music] everybody okay let me go back online hallelujah so this oil delivered rapturing faith brother branham says this he says we okay remember it's not the first soil it is the water listen to brother branham brother bonham say i am looking for a time of a breakfast of the water in this last day in which in this last day that we are now in for another of the water so there was already a surge but brother branham said i'm looking for another stream [Applause] [Music] the holy spirit but another [Music] i am looking for another surge of the holy spirit into the water for water so rapturing faith so rapture in faith come only by the second search yes without the second one more rapturing faithful rapturing faithful makes you ready to meet the blood groomer just before it water and everything is sitting straight in order for that and i believe that we are now at the time that the world should have water that's why i don't have cliques but here i believe that the time to lay aside our water all our camp in the message i'm not talking about creed outside a message i'm talking about creating in the message churches where are we today confused everybody here but the true blood will not be confused he said i believe that the time to lay aside our water and our water and come back to water amen glory to god brother branham say i want you to get build up in this holy water in there my friend online make sure you pull this up so people can see it when they go home everybody here the faith of what not the faith of paul because paul never made it to the rapture and we need the faith that will give us rapturing [Music] we want to live in this world like this everything is crumbling the economy is down america is down russia is down what else do you want in this world i want something that can take me off [Music] and there will be a message and the message is already there to prepare you for meeting the bridegroom and that message is the message of william maryam [Music] i am not ashamed of the friend of the broad group the water it's going to take more work are we okay it will take more faith than ever was in water for this seas this has to be water rapturing faith is not a game it takes a higher faith a higher anointing a higher oil a higher surge of the holy ghost a third cool anointing glory to god you praying with the seals they're preaching their seals they're preaching they say do you know what the seals mean do you know what the candidates mean [Music] everybody okay brother branham said everyone knows that for as certain as the first was water the first pool so here's the water and if you shall think real closely you who are water you okay catch this as the bible say here is he that has what [Music] [Music] [Music] how can you have wisdom you must have withdrawal we okay he that has wisdom that bird is properly water we know where it is so the third pool is water and the third pool was the water opening water that i must not say much about them as he told me in the beginning say nothing of it he speak for itself i have tried to explain the other i made a mistake this will be the things that do my work i don't say the lord tell me this are you afraid of that paul say in the bible this is not god this is me paul it's written in the bible but paul the bible says that every scripture is inspired even what paul said that it was him in this bible is his prayer this will be this will be a thing what the third pro that will start what for the water it's a different anointing my friend it's an anointing that breaks the world he breaks the seals and he releases the tandems that's why brother branham said he continued he said amanda what for just a little he have to decrease now remember and who is listening to this step you must see a water in my ministry right they were doing water why because the blood room is already there the blood room is taking control we have one foot on the earth one foot on the oven i got control brother branham you can go now so we are not alone there ever presence of god when you sleep he's there when you walk he's there when you burn him he's there that your work is there in your bedroom he's there wherever you are god is always there i will never leave you now forsake you i will be with you all the way to the end i'm gonna make sure you will enter in the rapture glory to god [Music] is not here we already finished the job the bridegroom is here jesus christ is here [Music] we okay i have not started the seed yet can i continue glory to god he said you will see a dropping back not going by what we are right at the edge now it can be can't go any water we have to wait just a minute until this happened over to do it then it comes and it will be it is water what do we have to wait wait for what there is coming a time upon in this america to where this nation is going to exercise all the power of the water [Music] [Music] we okay now do you see why the second year is connected to the beast everybody okay the beast head before him which was water when he becomes water that this nation will do that you need a third pool the third pool break the seals the seals release water if the third pool gives rapturing faithful so the seals give was burning faith and the thunder give rupturing faith because all of them are water that's why brother branham said there is coming forth water that is not even because they were sealed everybody care that's right i believe that through those waters will be revealed in there in order to get the bread together for what rapturing fair is in the seventh hundred it is in the third pool it is in the seventh year it is in the message of the hour all of them are one [Music] we got what we got right now we will not be able to do it there is something we got to step water you need a different oil we can have enough fat for water we've got to have enough faith to be we've got to have enough to be water in the water and sweep out out of water so to have rapture in fat you need water [Music] everybody okay everybody okay that's why paul was afraid that i'm afraid because the church failed why because paul knew in part and he preached in water but dwanda which is water who's perfect but the bridegroom himself when there are that which is prophet come when i see jesus do i need poor do i need arenas do i need columba do i need brother branham again i already see my husband that's all that matters when that which is complete comes life is finished then i can dance because my husband is there everybody okay let's get into the serpent my friend that's why brother branham said we have opportunity that's water we have opportunity that what do you know that is not what translated how do we have more opportunity than enoch [Music] everybody here everybody enoch built the pyramid but he never put the capstone [Music] [Applause] [Music] enoch never put the caps on a man but i know somebody who knows the capstone brother branham i will tell you who will have it it will be a water as thoroughly water even more thoroughly water than was any other in all the ages from what to what because this man will of necessity have the water prophetic water ever here that's why we have more than enoch [Music] we have more than elijah elijah went in the rupture but elijah must come back and be killed [Music] everybody here we have more opportunity than all them never had the opportunity we have it's a second oil my friend jesus died on calvary he paid the pass why was john crying if the price was already paid because the job was not finished yet until you pack that book when you break the seals that it is [Music] glory to god let's get into our serpent my god glory to god do you see what broke last night to young people [Music] amen let's go [Music] you want to stop are you good you're good okay brother branham says that are discord in our process and all these things and ism today by god's grace every one of them i'm good in time it's just we in eternity when a galaxy and all this kind of thing that's fine he said i by god's grace every one of them written in water where he get its beginning back then it's just got another remember the name changes but the person is still jonathan can be in ammon you will think it's almond speaking but it's not ammon it is who jonathan everybody why do we know you watch the working of the spirit in that day and you watch how it's working today and you shall see that it's the very water glory to god where are you heading now you ready brother branham told us that the beast at the beginning was the beast in the garden of eden that's why we still are there in the garden of eden hallelujah and brother branham say there is a trail that you can follow and at the end you're going to find another beast amen but this beast at the end brother branham say it's a religious person and not only a religious person but branham said he's also a denomination when we speak denomination we are talking about a church amen and we talk when we talk about the church a church in the bible is represented by a woman let's go to proverbs chapter 7 [Music] lord help me move this quickly [Music] if you dare you can say amen get your scripture if you already memorized the bible fine suit yourself everybody because some people keep looking at me they don't watch no scripture say praise god when the devil will come you will remember what was the scripture about the stephen saying my son verse one keep my word we went through this in a hotel i'm gonna touch up and move quickly my son because when we talk about the word subtility amen we took the example of a serpent and the serpent used was a masculine a male serpent then we talk about amnon on wednesday and amnon was still a man amen so we dealt with a male version amen that was the version of eden but at the end brother branham say it's a woman so you gotta know also in the woman version we okay now are we okay now are you awake now okay i'm laying foundation until by the time we get to the beach you'll be looking you say i see it all right verse 2 keep my commandment and leave and my law as the apple of your eye burn them upon your fingers everybody write them upon the table of your heart say to her are we okay he's talking to a man he says say to wisdom we know that wisdom is christ we okay say to wisdom you are my water how can wisdom be a woman [Music] tell wisdom now you become a woman you become a church [Music] tell wisdom wisdom is going to be a church now we okay we okay tell wisdom you are my sister and call understanding my water not king's men that day may keep you from water there is a woman that is strange from the stranger which flatters you're going to see down the road how this woman use flattery which flat earth with her words for at the window remember in the hotel of my house i looked through my casement and i beheld among the naive one the simple one a design among the youth a young man void of water so the young men didn't have wisdom their husband their young men didn't have understanding so there is a young man here this young man is not connected with wisdom this young man doesn't have the second oil this young man is not wise he's not a wise virgin what happened when you don't have the old when you don't have a connection with wisdom young man what happened he says passing through the street near her corner who is her and he went the way to her house so solomon said i was watching i saw a young man without a second oil who's going to a house and he went to a corner and he began to go to a house where is the young man going amen in the twilight in the water so at the evening somebody will be moving around toward a certain house in the evening time everybody okay in the evening in the black in the now in the dark water in laodicea when everything is dark everybody here gross darkness there is a young man void of understanding doesn't have the second oil amen he's moving toward the house first thing and behold they met him a what with the attire of a word and water [Music] so we found now a woman do you know her name she is a harlot [Music] and not only harlot her heart is subtle amen the word subtility what is this startedness subtility doing job two verse uh job two verse fourteen well verse 13 i'm skipping so she caught him the woman and kissed him and with an improvement she's not a shame first said to him i have water so this woman has peace offering so it's a harlot that is religious always speaking peacefully peace offering glory to god [Music] very good everybody okay everybody everybody okay please suffering with me this day i'll pay my vow job down so we get uh to verse uh 17. you there he says i have perfumed my water you see where he's bringing the young man with myrrh alice and cinnamon let's keep that quickly come let us take our field of love until the morning let us solace ourselves with water if you look at the word harlot quickly you will think that she's a free woman but let's see if she was really free you okay job to verse 19 for the water do you know what goodmans means so she was a harlot but married am i reading a different bible it's a married woman but she's a harlot where is her husband okay let's decode her husband for the good man the husband is a good man he's not a bad man the husband is a good man [Music] the husband is a good man did you get it let me say it again the husband is a good man okay let's decode it one time the rich young ruler [Music] you got the answer you got the answer he met jesus christ he said good water jesus said there is no one good but who so who's the good man let's go back again now the good man is not a home he's gone a lot you remember the parable of jesus christ a man that left the uh people taking care of the van and going to uh okay verse 20 and he has taken a bag of money faith with him and will come home at the day water so there is a day appointed that the husband will return there is a day appointed that jesus will return there is a day appointed for the rapture it's an appointed day but when the husband is out away she begin to commit adultery everybody okay with her much fair speech she caused him to yield with flattery of her lips she forced him he goes after her immediately as he knocks goes to the water and as a food to the correction of stocks till a water a dart struck through his liver as a bird hastened to a name and know not that he was for what as long as soon as the young men follow her as he's approaching the home they kill him who killed the prostitute a prostitute that is sadly hard religious committing adultery everybody okay verse uh 25 let not your heart decline to her ways go not astray in her path for she has cast down water she's drunk with the blood of many people she kills so many people until her cup is filled with the blood everybody yeah many strong men have been slain by her she's a killer anybody okay her house is the way of water going to the chambers of water stop let's go to revelation 17. [Music] i'm gonna go quickly here i didn't intend to get this but i'm going to stabilize somebody everybody here you there i will get to this detail down the road but let's just scratch the surface verse one and there came one of the seven angel which have the seven vowel you know this angel we went to the hotel and talked with me saying to him come here i will show you the of the great water that sits upon many water we will get to that later job two verse five everybody here and upon you there and upon her forehead was a name written mystery water the water the mother of water an abomination of the water and i saw the woman drunken with the blood of the water a killer her heart is a heart a sadder heart and the beast in the garden of eden was a sadder more sadder than anybody subtlety in the beast subtility in ammon sanctility in the lord jesus in this harlot connected with sex connected with sex [Music] we okay now who is the seed of the wicked one let's get there we know that there are two adam one is from heaven and another one from the earth and the bible said the earthly is the one that comes first that's why all messengers are born first that's why brother branham has to be born first then christ come later everybody okay it's a principle of the scripture we understand that now brother branham says follow carefully now the serpent was more subtle than any beast which the lord has in the field but obama said this beast was so close to a human being and yet was pure animal we went through this that he could reason and do what the only animal that can talk without the permission of god different than the uh the the donkey of uh of berlin he was an upright creature he was somehow somewhat in between the chimpanzee and a man but closer to a man he was so close to human being that his seed could and did what mingle with that of the woman and cause her to the water where do you think the devil would go amen he was the more sadder the more saddle mushroomed cunning wisdom everybody okay smaller than any than the animal he was right next to who remember he was a vice president the most sadly of all beasts of the field and now you say satan could not have been the serp the serpent if you shall go with me now over to second corinthians chapter 11 verse 14 the bible says that he transformed himself we read it into an angel of water you just underestimate satan [Music] yes sir he made himself into an angel of light if he could come in that kind of substance which is the angel then why couldn't he come into a beast next things to men that's why we demonstrated on wednesday that now the bible said in revelation 12 that the great dragon was cast down that old not the new serpent according to the bible the old serpent follow me carefully the old serpent why does john have to say old serpent because the new serpent doesn't talk [Music] the new serpent doesn't look like a man the new serpent doesn't walk upright he crawls on the floor so john if he said the serpent it will cause confusion john said the old serpent because the odd doesn't exist anymore we have a new serpent a new version the odd is telling you go back at the beginning before the curse the serpent that serpent that was talking that serpent that was walking that serpent that was closer to god uh closer to adam that serpent that only was different from adam by the soul that serpent was the devil [Music] and water we know that the devil was the tree of life and we know that the serpent was a beast the serpent was a beast the devil was the tree i'm sorry of knowledge of good and what amen how can the tree be a serpent everybody here the serpent brother bottom say that the serpent are certain enter into the serpent how do you [Music] everybody know another word what john is saying john said that battle serpent called the water he didn't have a name first he was just serpent that's how adam call him but when the devil enter into him you can call the serpent now the devil in other words the devil was made flesh in the serpent when the devil entered the serpent the serpent becomes the devil everybody okay [Music] how do you know it's the devil remember the name can change the bible saying in genesis 3 that the serpent did he say the devil did he say the devil he says the who but you say that but john said the serpent was the devil but they didn't say the devil the serpent said to the woman ye shall not surely water the serpent said to the woman you shall not surely what god said you shall surely what in other words the serpent for the first time since his creation contradicted god god created him he was in the garden of eden all along he never do any harm for some reason we found out that when the serpent came and began to talk to eve eve repeated to the serpent the gospel of god and the serpent contradicted god for the first time he says he will surely not die in other words god say you will surely die the serpent say you will not surely die in other words the serpent is making god a liar [Music] everybody here when you make god the liar the serpent is destroying the character of god in front of his children everybody here when you destroy a character of a man in front of his children you are actually killing the man you are committing murder [Music] are we okay so when the devil said you shall not surely die he was committing murder against god and he was also lying the bible says in john chapter 8 verse 44 ye are your father the who and the last of your father he won he was a water from water who was speaking on the in the devil in the serpent he was a murderer from water in the beginning he says god is a liar and a boat not in the water because in heaven lucifer could not stay true to god when he comes in the earth is he going to stay true to the word of god so it's not the serpent the beast it is who was inside the serpent everybody okay because there is no truth in him when he speaketh he speak with water [Music] he shall not surely die was that the truth he was water if this statement shows murder and shows lie because he's speaking from his own he said and the father who do you think was in the serpent who was in the serpent [Music] open genesis 4. going to run quickly lord help me open genesis 4. everybody okay oh they help me you open genesis 4 if you dare you can say amen go to verse 4 you there and able he also brought forth the first lane of his flock and of the fat thereof and the lord had respect to abel and to his offering brother abel but to cain and his offering he had no water and ken was very angry and his countenance fell and the lord said to cain why are you angry and why is your countenance falling if you do well shall you not be accepted and if you do not well sin lies at the door the door of cain sin is already there and to you shall his desire and you shall rule over him and can talk with abel his brother and he came to pass when they were in the field that cain rose up against evil and deed water he committed water the devil does two things he's a murderer and he's a liar ken committed murder let's see if cain lied we okay job two verse nine and the lord said to cain where is evil your brother and he said i know he didn't know where ever was everybody okay so ken did two things murder and what the devil did two things murder and water where is cane coming from hold on [Music] hold on let's keep moving everybody okay everybody okay now the bible says he that committed sin is off the water for the devil sinneth from the water but we see that the one who sinned in the beginning was the serpent but john is saying he was not the serpent he was there that's why the old serpent was the devil and satan the devil sings from the beginning for this purpose the son of god was manifested that he might destroy the work of water so the one that was talking in the serpent was not the serpent it was their devil another example in matthew 16 when jesus began when from that time forth began jesus to show unto his disciple had that he must go on to jerusalem and suffer many things to the elder and the chief priest and scribe and be killed and be raised again there third day jesus is talking we okay then peter took him and begin to do what who was rebuking jesus if i ask you who's rebuking jesus you will say who who do you see doing that saying fabidi this shall not be unto thee but he turned and say unto you get deep behind me peter [Music] so who was talking in peter who was talking in the serpent that's why jesus told peter that satan have searched for you so long but because of predestination because you are predestinated sin i have prayed for you [Music] that your faith does water that's why the brother don't understand you you going through crisis in your life we put you down he thinks that you already messed up and suddenly you're coming back to god you go down you come back to god you got done he come back to god he even make you backstreet we say i got him finished but for some reason you come back again to church it is not you somebody prayed for you you got covered he cannot do anything [Music] hallelujah that's why you run you come back you run you come back you run you come back you need to stop and say wait a minute i ran three times i came back i am not a child of the devil i am a child of the king [Applause] because the devil when he was cursed he never was redeemed back when he fall you cannot redeem him back it is only children of god peter can be recuperated but not judah judah goes one time and he's gone but not peter peter will come back again and after the resurrection jesus said go tell my disciple and who showing the devil that you see you try to help people i'm still loving peter and i have confidence in peter i'm gonna give him the key of the kingdom amazing grace amazing grace it is beyond your head and man after my own heart no matter what happened that is still my child [Music] glory to god you want me continue stop glory to god amen let's move on jesus christ lord help me when the devil spoke his life everybody this lie open up in the woman through area he affected her sight he affected her desire and he also wanted her to have a wisdom higher than the wisdom of god brother branham says this lord help me he said in matthew 4 wherein jesus is tempted of the devil he overcome the personal temptation of satan by water and by the word in each of the three waters that corresponded exactly to the temptation of the garden of what everybody okay everybody okay the water [Music] the eyes were pleasant and the pride of water you want to wish them more than god [Music] if you find somebody's telling you something and after you talk to that person it begin to bring a wrong desire in you let me continue brother branham say he's 40 days of temptation by god's word he overcame i want to express something here just a few minutes satan made premature water upon him in there it's always in them don't forget it he made three major water from there through the water he tried his best to conquer him but he was the what did he use himself the word satan's three major attacks or assault upon him but he met him with what every attack he could make with the water if eve would have stuck with the world that's all you have to do she would have handed a serpent let me move on quickly that's why the bible say love not the water neither the things of the lust of the eyes desire if any man loves the world the love of the father is not even what and all that is in the the entire kingdom of satan is only in three part the last of the water the last of the water the plot of water is not of the water but is of the water this wisdom descended not from heaven that wisdom there but it's earth and it's water and it's water essential is connected to sex it's a wisdom that is connected to sexual desire it's a wisdom from the devil you say sex brother stephen no problem you say sex brother stephen no problem let me go this way eve says this that the woman say unto the serpent we may eat of the fruit of the tree of the god but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden god has said you shall not remember this and what what is eating in first corinthians chapter 7 verse 1 the bible says now concerning the things whereof you wrote unto me we okay we okay it is good for a man not to water catch a water what kind of touch is that touching like this nevertheless to avoid water the touch is fornication it's why did he curse her conception amen if to avoid fornication let every man has his own and let every woman have her own so this touch is a sexual act check what about eating you ready devil really all right in the sound of solomon the bible say a garden in clothes is my water so a woman is a garden [Music] am i reading a different bible a woman is a field [Music] a garden that isn't close she's virgin my spouse a spring that is water she's my spouse a fountain that is water she's a virgin verse 16 and why call northwind and come that's half wind blow out upon my water that my spice there of my water let my beloved come into his water and do it did you see women walking around with apples on them [Music] i have to break it down like that so an 11 years old can get it do you see women working with fruit cantaloupe whatever what are they heading so it means water let me help you again prophet t.b search is the way of the water an adultery is for somebody who is already married and eve was already an adulterous woman she does what it's your bible so the touching is sex the eating is water both of them are everybody okay let's see what perfect math and say i have done on what adultery that's why eve have committed adultery because it was saying eating she was a married woman and a married woman committing adultery she's eating that's why the bible say when she ate and she because she she now realized that she is naked what makes her realize naked because that eating was a sexual [Music] act everybody okay let's head quickly amen that's why the bible said adam was not deceived but the woman being water was in the water adam came later and he looked he said god is going to kill my wife let me take her sin so that when god comes he cannot destroy him he cannot destroy sarah when abraham is there he cannot destroy me when christ has come the bird groom comes there's nothing god can do if he'd show me he destroyed good question everybody okay so far amen brother branham said the devil came down and cut into the water and he found eve in the garden of eden naked and he talked about the fruit in the midst the meets the middle you understand in a mixed congregation because the woman is a gardener he said now it's pleasant it's good to the earth what did he do he began making love to eve and he lived with her and as a such is the way of an adulterous woman amen what about them says saturday morning perhaps met this evil one the serpent which was the serpent not in a raptor but a beast more suddenly cunning smart of all the beasts just under men a man is a beast himself we are warm blooded animal that this fellow found eve in the garden of eden the serpent this young woman that knoweth no sin know if not what her nakedness was he smart shadow wise he told her the fruit the seed the fruit was pleasant it was desirable and when he lived with her and then the afternoon she persuaded adam to do the same tell him what he wanted the timing was not far away this is what brother branham said what does the bible say about the timing the bible says in the morning do it and in the evening do what you can sow in the morning you can sow in the evening [Music] why do you need to sow twice because you don't know whether where they shall water either this or or what both of them can conceive either one you don't get caught oh both of them they catch you everybody okay [Music] i'm rushing quickly let's go to genesis 4 back again they're not finished lord help me so i can head straight oh my god let's hide you there first one you there adam louise his wife and she conceived and borhoo this is where the denomination are blinded but let's take your denominational idea away and you can go home okay the way he looks right now he looks like adam was the father of cain right but we know cain committed murder and he lied but we know who is a liar and a murderer but let's leave that alone because they're gonna fight you they say this say adam and eve okay adam and eve and broken and she said i have gotten a man from the lord why do you give birth to a child and you say oh the lord give me this child who do you think give you the child why do you have to say that only when kane is born let's see when abel is born if something is spoken verse two and she again born not she got pregnant again no no no they were following me and she again bore his brother who and ever was a keeper of shift did they say anything about abel when abel is born if he's quiet why did she only spoke about cain that i got a man from the lord brother branham says this he says if saved i have gotten a son from the lord or a man from the lord why certainly god has a law everybody okay you take a seat and plant it out there in the field where there is wheat and you plant briars out remember a parable i don't care the same sun the same rain bring that seed to life god has a law and that cannot be broken the audience woman in town a prostitute the honest man they are married and everything if they have an affair they live together they will bring a child in other words anything adultery will bring a child would you say that that child came from satan because it's adultery you're gonna make satan and credo everybody okay brother branham say if you don't you make satanic creator then he's a god oh how blind can you be if you ever got a baby i don't care if he was who or who or whoever he was or any ill femme person if he was who he had to come by who how can you say that the bible says that can who was of the what [Music] you have few minutes the bible says that cain was a child of who ken was a child of the wicked one who is the wicked one cain was the child of the wicked one who is the wicked one amen amen cain was a child of the wicked one according to genesis 4 the bible says that adam knew eve his wife and she conceived and brought who according to genesis chapter 4 the father of cain is who adam is adam a wicked one let me help you up the bible says which was of enos which was of the son of said which was the son of whom which was the son of who so adam was the son of who am i reading a different bible according to the bible adam is the son of who but cain is the son of whom but the bible say adam knew eve and he produced his cain but adam was a son of god so adam was a wicked one so who's the father of cain [Music] you ready go to uh we on genesis chapter four go to job to verse 25 i'm almost finished give me a few grace you there are you there are you there somebody got are you there the bible says and adam because right here can kill evil so adam was left with one child kane okay and adam knew his wife again not the first time everybody okay the first time he produces over there adam knew his wife again and she bought a son called his name who said adam produced said but we know that adam came from god we okay now he knew and and produced it for god she said had appointed everybody okay need another water another seed instead of water whom ken did what if he's saying that because ever was killed set replaced appointed instead in the place of able god replace said so set is the replacement of able in other words set is the compensation that's what the word said to me everybody okay so now if you want to talk about the children of adam you can go straight from adam to set because set is only ever in replacement do you hear me seth and ever are the same they took stable off and they switch it with set that's why brother branham say seth and evil represent jesus christ one represent jesus christ killed at the cross and the other represent jesus christ resurrected because it's the same person they just switched them everybody okay so far everybody okay so far so we know now that ever from adam set from adam adam from god but came from the wicked but adam is now wicked who's the father of cain job to genesis chapter five i'm almost going there you there first one this is the book of the generation of who ah now we need to know the children of adam now no more argument we okay now we need to know the children of adam this is the book of the generation of adam the children of adam

of and set was in the likeness of who who was in the likeness of who am i reading a different bible i'm jumping down are we ready in his own and call his name who watch carefully my word in the scripture and the days of adam after you follow me not before after he had father who so ken was already born because ken was older than set he had the same age with abel so after set meaning ken is already existing after set after set he further after set after he had father said we're 800 years and he found a what songs and what so after set there was sons and daughters of who adam these sons are not king because ken was older than sick the bible said after said so they were little brother we okay now so the only oldest son remaining is cain the bible say he's off the weekend but the bible

you go home you there verse 37 we know the parable of the wheat and the top and the parable of the tale there were two men there was a man in his enemy right they both put seed okay we want to see the wicked one so we will know who is the seed of the wicked one and next time we will see who is the seed of the woman and we will see both of them fighting we okay verse 37 if you're there you can say amen let's go to verse 36 then jesus sent the multitude away and went into the house and his disciple came to him saying declare us the parable over there among all the parables the disciples were attracted to the tears verse 37 he answered and said to them he the souls the good seed is the everybody okay so the son of man the one who was sowing good seed was the son of man everybody okay we want to see the enemy job to verse 38 the field is the the good seed are the children of the kingdom but the tears are the children of the ken is a child of the details are the children often so cain is a tale and ever and said these are wheat are we okay are we okay are we okay watch verse 39 the enemy the wicked one the enemy that saw them is dead so the wicked one is who so can being a child of the wicked means that cain is a child of whom amen the seed of the wicked one the seed of the devil ever here take first john chapter 2. you get this scripture and when you hear the serpent seed your eyes are open and we finish here this message is perfectly in line with the scripture perfectly let's go to first john chapter 2 verse 13. if you dare you can say amen everybody there i write to you father because you have known him that is from the beginning i write to you young man because you have overcome i write to you little children because you have known the father i have written to you father because you have known him that is from the beginning i have written to you young man because you are strong and the word of god abide in you and you have overcome the water [Music] go to chapter 5 verse 18 and we stop first john chapter 5 verse 18 and we stop you there we know we know that whatsoever is born of what does water was adam deceived everybody okay what is born of god doesn't commit sin but he that is begotten of god keep himself and touches him is a child of the wicked one a child of the devil that's why he does not appear in the genealogy of god what happened there was a sexual act that happened between eve and the serpent and that sexual act brought cain and cain was the seed of the wicked one who is the seed of the woman next time let's stand there [Applause] everybody okay thank you for your patience i am sorry i have to nail this if i leave it so we're going to spin again behind everybody okay you cannot do anything without the second one amen now we know that when they say that the serpent has a seed we know clearly by the scripture that that seed is talking about cane but who is the seed of the woman and if you find the seed of the woman if that seed started from the beginning there is a seed of the woman both of them are going to fight all the way to the end ever here we are still under the trail of the serpent let's pray heavenly father lord we are approaching you again humbly father this afternoon thanking you for your grace for your love your mercy and for everything you have been doing for us father the hour is late and we have to lay down every scripture down so that your children can be grounded in the word and the things that they heard before just spoken through the pulpit now they can then they can themself trace
