to desire beautiful beautiful [Music] city of God Amen let's give him a big clap of them the beautiful city of God Hallelujah you know there are two cities of God right do you know there are two cities of God that's fine just hang on tight you will see how many cities of God we have amen just be patient everything will be okay and when you will discover one of the city you'll be amazed like wow I didn't know this was a city of God Amen so at least when I throw a seeds like this is gonna pull a thirst on you and somebody will go start searching and reading the prophet which is going to be good amen how many understood the thoughts and the theophany and the word amen is it clear now or somebody still have questions clear praise God if you didn't get it clear you need to review it because on Sunday we will dig again deeper than that amen I tried to pull forward the Holy Spirit to won't let me and I have to stop where I stop by God's grace everything is good there are some deep deep very deep channels into this subject amen because if it's not handled properly you will lock people because of the mistake of their great grandfather or the father or somebody made a mistake and you send people to hell because you don't know how to handle stuff amen this message is precious but it need to be handled by the spirit of the message which is the holy spirit amen if not you're going to pull somebody and put him in hell when they are seed of God so there are certain things that are very very deep very very deep and I tried to lower some of them but I can't I have to read the whole thing the way brother Brandon put it in because it's going to free somebody a man is going to free you completely just the word you will know the truth and the truth will set you free amen there are children of God that have been bound amen do you think the people that made the error in marriage and divorce are only serpent seed there is a bunch of children of God that are bound into it so how is God going to Freedom amen because one way is armenianism and the other way is Calvinism the armenianists want to send everybody to hell but then and the Calvinists want to get everybody to Heaven even the Devil Himself amen so let's find out the real middle where the message is and tried to pull it so it's very deep some of them are very serious that's why I have to go slowly slowly to make sure the truth touches your heart and it sets you completely free and you will understand what is the baptism of the Holy Spirit now I know you're already getting it now clear why do you need to be born again amen then you will see everything we went through Ezekiel the new heart the new spirit and everything will blend on together so that has been said you need to pray for me amen they have the many strong statements if I give you one you will go home thinking twice like what is going on so you pray for me so we stay really really in deep prayer because it's really deep Channel but once we grasp it it will free you completely you don't even need for me to lay hand on you where you are when you just see it completely the devil begin to get off from you like oh somebody's awake and I need to get away from it amen that's the Deliverance it's the Deliverance of the Soul once it touches you Satan will know the body you can have it the Pentecost will have it all the time amen it doesn't scare the devil when your soul is awakened the devil knows and in heaven Jesus said there is joy in heaven when only one of them one of the sin have repented there is a joy there is a fist in heaven when one of the sin have repented amen I believe you receive uh the message for this coming Saturday at four o'clock amen if you think your schedule is busy mine is more busier than you amen because I have to do this on Saturday and I have to preach on Sunday so I don't know when I'm gonna sleep so you pray for me if you can by the grace of God the whole church is invited I'm not going to stream this we will talk about music amen so come Pray For Me music is a very difficult subject because we're using the same instrument the same instrument you're using are the same instrument the people on the secular world are using amen the same microphone they have microphone just like me so you need to know what to do amen so if you can if you're gonna be a future musician in the church or we will have more song leader or more people that are gifted for music or you have a gift in your life or you want to sing a special come on in let's sit let's all talk about music let's go with music through the scripture and let's go with music through the court of brother Branham so from there on when you listen to a music you don't need me to be there you can gauge your music even though he says Christian music you will sit and you say they saying Christian amen and another one you can say okay this sounds like a Christian this is redeemable amen amen so I'm in a hot seat more than you you should be saying amen more than me amen so you pray for me Lord's willing we meet at four o'clock on Saturday here and we go over music it is required for every musician if you're singing in a choir or whatever you need to be here to hear it amen because we want to have a filter to make sure whatever we do here continue to please the spirit of the lord it's a powerful Channel and it's also a dangerous one amen the music can bring God down it can also bring the devil down I don't know if you give me music can bring God down he can also bring the devil down music can cause you trouble music can get you in a hotel room music can get you shaking when you don't want to shake you'll find your foot padding like this and you say wait a minute in Jesus name did it happen to you [Music] go eat in a restaurant amen and you figure it out the power of music it's a very good tool it can bring God down but we need to be careful it can also bring the devil we don't want the devil in this church we want God in this church so on Saturday at four o'clock coming here musician require technician requires song Specialists whoever want to sing song in the congregation coming in sing here because after this Saturday amen if your song Don't filter through what is going to be presented we're not going to agree everybody okay not my standard the standard of the everybody okay so make sure you there you know what is the message saying about music what does the scripture says about music so when you preparing to sing music you pray when God gave you one you come and we will go ahead and sing you might ask yourself a question brother Stephen have we been doing something wrong in our worship I didn't say that the Holy Spirit has been pleasing but the devil doesn't let you quiet like that once in a while he will try to slip something in so now we need to get protected you grown up now three years old church so you got teeth amen let's the order is already placed there let's put it in amen if you don't show up don't come in fast okay if you don't show up don't fast if we say no because you deliberately didn't show up and you don't know what we are uh our our Plum line our measuring stickies so don't fast amen so know the thoughts of God we are on the same page and he move on it's like when I preach about church order not everybody was here so if you want to fast before you fast make sure you ask questions about what did Brother Branham say about this and this and this because sometimes people get upset they don't even know what brother Branham say amen they don't read the message but they just fuss and you say do you know what brother Brown I'm saying oh I didn't know so let's come together let's talk as a family you pray for me I pray for you and the Holy Spirit will help all of us amen glory to God believe it or not unless the Lord Jesus Christ come or something major comes for me to change but we're gonna land amen like it or not we will be there amen glory to God you got the quotes about the drum I added two more so you got seven I got the eighth one which is an emergency amen so you should be covered by that brother said coffee is preaching tonight you know brother said coffee I told him welcome home it is not his first home it is his second home amen so you know him pull on the gift of the Lord and God will speak to us tonight his family is here God bless you Sister in the child I know there is his boy stays with Grandpa but the family is here so let's pull on the gift of the Lord and let the Holy Spirit speak to us tonight

house tonight we got Believers that believe Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever amen amen it's so good to see you this evening I'm so glad to be here um just consider it a privilege and honor I really appreciate that song I was speaking to the Lord before I came and I said Lord I would really love for them to sing only believe before I preached so I was very thankful and if you remember that last time I was here we were preaching on the name of Jesus and and then I can't remember the exact song that you sing brother Stephen but you might have been there's power in the name of Jesus or something like that but it just lined up perfectly so we're so glad that the Lord is always on time and the Lord you know I think one thing that we we must realize about the Lord is is the Lord isn't just in today the Lord is in before the foundation of the world the lord knew everything that we would ever have need of the Lord knew what would be said tonight the Lord knows what we have need of tonight and you know it it's amazing to me because there's actually times in our life that we don't even know what we need but God always knows what we need and have need of amen amen amen so we're very thankful to be here and I told Brother Wayne Lawson if I remembered I'd say it he wanted I had to I called him today because I was looking for something and in the message and he told me to greet the church while I was here so brother Wayne Lawson says hello to you and I'm not going to try to hold you long but I'm not good at keeping my promise but if you have your Bibles and we can turn to Hebrews the 11th chapter I'll try to get out of the way amen are you happy tonight amen I'm very very happy you're preaching on on music and all that different thing but I was sitting there going man does he really have to get out and say that stuff to the church and in correction and stuff before I have to come out and preach no that's a that's a great subject you know I mean it's amazing that you said that brother because it was just Sunday I think it was me and my wife we're talking about how you never really hear any ministering on music and and you know that's a that's something that I would like to to be a part of and hear as well we we got to make sure we're praising the right one and and with that being said tonight how you act towards this service will determine which one you're praising tonight when the word of God is going forth you have everybody has an opportunity to accept or reject the word of God and it's actually a sweet smelling it's a it's an incense coming up to God it's a praise there's nothing better to God than when you say Amen to the word of God God is always just looking for someone to believe his word amen amen we love you so Hebrews the 11th chapter and we'll begin with verse one and I believe the title that I I gave brother Stephen was the the pulsation of faith and and when we're going to look at that and maybe looking at the Unseen as well and that same thought now in verse 1 it says now Faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen so it's something real but you really can't see it with these natural lies amen for by the elders obtained a good report through true faith we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God so that things which are seen were not made of the things which do appear by faith Abel offered unto God a more excellent sacrifice than came by which he obtained witness that he was righteous God testifying of of his gifts and by it he being dead yet speaketh by faith Enoch was translated we're starting to see that face a pretty important thing that he should not see death and he was not found because God had translated him before his translation he had this testimony that he pleased God how did he please God by faith amen but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is not he was not he will be he is and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him by faith Noah being warned of God of Things Not Seen as yet moved with fear prepared an art to the saving of his house by the which he condemned the world and became heir of righteousness which is by Faith by faith Abraham when he was called out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance obeyed he went out not knowing whether he went by faith he sojourned in the land of promise as in a strange country dwelling in Tabernacles with Isaac and Jacob The Heirs with him of the same promise for he looked for a city which hath foundations whose Builder and maker is God he couldn't see it but he was looking for it and he knew it was there though through faith also Sarah herself received strength conceived seed and was delivered of a child when she was past age because she judged remember I told you you're judging something this evening judged him faithful who had promised therefore spring therefore even of the one in him as good as dead so many as the stars of the sky in the multitude and as the sand which is upon the seashore innumerable these all died in the faith not yet having received the promises but have seen them afar off and were persuaded of them church I want to say this they didn't see the message of the hour that we seen they didn't see the certain things that we sing that should increase I say if they can believe that how much more should we be able to believe with the things that we have seen and embrace them and confess that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth for they that say for they that say such things declare plainly that they seek a country and truly if they had been mindful of that country from whence they came out of they might have had opportunities to have returned but now they desire a better country that isn't that is Heavenly wherefore God is not ashamed to be called they're gone forever prepared for them a city by faith Abraham when he was tried offered up Isaac I know this is a long reading but you're all right amen and he that had received the promise offered up his only begotten son of whom it was said that in Isaac shall all thy seed be called accounting that God was able to raise him up even from the dead from whence he from also he received him in a figure by faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau concerning the things that come by faith Jacob when he was a dying blessed both the sons of Joseph and worshiped leaning leaning upon the top of his staff by faith Joseph when he died made mention of the departing of the children of Israel so Joseph didn't see this but he believed it concerning gave commandment concerning his bones by faith Moses when he was born was hit three months of his parents because they saw he was a proper child and they were not afraid of the king's commandment by faith Moses when he was come to years refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter choosing rather to suffer the afflictions with the people of God than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season esteeming the reproach of Christ greater riches than the treasures in Egypt for he had respect unto the recompense of the reward by faith he forsooked Egypt not fearing the Wrath of the king for he endured as seeing him who is invisible through faith he kept the Passover and the sprinkling of blood lest he that destroyed the firstborn should touch them by faith they passed through the Red Sea as dry land which the Egyptians are saying to do were drown by faith the walls of Jericho fell down after they were compressed come past seven days by faith the Harlot Rahab perished not with them that believe not when she had received the spies with peace and what shall I what more shall I say for the time would fail me to tell of Gideon and of Moroccan of the Samson and I can't pronounce that and David also in Samuel and of the prophets now listen who through faith subdue kingdoms wrought righteousness obtain promises and stopped the mouth of lions Amen Let Us bow our heads Heavenly Father Lord father I apologize I'm not a good reader father Lord I wish I would have done better in school father and and spent more time Lord God reading and and Lord just so I could pronounce your Bible better to your children but father I know that your strength is made perfect in weakness almighty God and Lord tonight father I'm not relying on my ability Father for I have none Lord I heard a mighty man of God tell me one time that preaching isn't any fun when you're doing it by yourself and Lord tonight I'm just asking father that you would bless your children in a special way father Lord you see the little thought on my heart almighty god father and Lord you know anytime I go into a service Lord I say Lord what would encourage your children father Lord what would be a help to them Father I you know father that I don't do this to lift myself up or make a name for myself but Lord I just want to lift up the name of Jesus father above every circumstance above every trial in our lives Lord and father tonight I just asked father that you would move in a special way Lord because by faith we're believing that you're going to do it almighty God by Faith Lord we're already seeing victory tonight before we ever get started almighty God by Faith Lord God we're seeing the victory in the house of the Lord tonight almighty god father we know that Lord we're so thankful Lord no matter what Satan planned for today you had a greater Plan before that before the foundation of the world almighty God you sing this night you've seen Us Victorious Lord you've seen your children worshiping Almighty God singing the songs of Zion and given to praise to him who is invisible almighty God but Lord we know one thing Lord It's Like the Wind almighty god father it might be invisible but we sure can see the effects of it almighty God and tonight Lord we would love to see the effects of the Holy Ghost almighty God just blowing through the building Lord God blowing out every enemy blowing down every trial almighty God everything that would try to stand before almighty God we curse it in the name of Jesus Christ and not father we're calling on the captain almighty God we're calling on the captain of the host almighty god father and we're here to say father we're not against you almighty God but we're for you almighty God where we're for you to do whatever you want to do almighty God Lord say what you want to say move how you want to move Lord our hearts are open before you tonight almighty God lord we take our heart almighty God we take everything that we feel how it should be almighty God and we just open it but for you Lord God and say Here's my heart almighty God do what you need to do in my life almighty God change whatever you need to change father and Lord we just ask that you would have preeminence of the service father in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen I'm sorry to keep you standing you may be seated and in Corinthians 4 18 it says while we look not at the things which are seen but the things which are not seen I I want to say you might have had a bad day today don't look at that you don't have to look at that you say well things went wrong today you don't have to look at that in fact we're told don't even look at that while we not we look not at the things which are seen but the things which are not seen for the things which are seen are temporal but the things which are not seen are Eternal so you can tell the devil right now at the beginning of the service whatever you've put me through everything that you've told me everything that I'm seeing with these natural eyes it's over with it's a temporal thing I'm going to make it through it I'm an eternal creature this time element cannot stop me we're talking on the pulsation of Faith now brother Brandon he would tell the story in looking at the Unseen of the TV salesman and that TV salesman would say I only believe in science and things that can be scientifically proven those are the things that are real and brother Branham says I hate to disagree with you but the only thing that Israel is that which cannot be scientifically proven he said what are you saying he said well I'll tell you what you believe in love don't you said yes well why don't you go buy me a quarter's worth of love he said you believe it's real right but you can't see it right but it's still real and that man he would begin to talk to him and they would begin to go back and forth and he would say see this TV right here he said as a control tower in it it has a receptor as a sender and a receiving station in it and brother random said he said but we can prove it because here's the picture showing that it's over there oh Hallelujah I love how brother Brandon said TV's been here as long as the world's began we're just now just Covenant if I could say it this way without being sounding sacrilegious Abraham discovered TV a long time before that you say what do you mean he was already looking for a city whose Builder and maker was God he didn't see it yet but he knew it was there what was it there was waves going back and forth through the air that was then you know what there was in Abraham there was a receiving station on the inside of Abraham see there was a sending station but there also has to be a receiving station you say what do you mean brother well let's look back in the Garden of Eden for a second when Cain and Abel would begin to make their sacrifices and God would be pleased with able sacrifice why Abel they didn't know they begin to look Adam and Eve begin to look at Abel and said who told him why is he bringing that lamb down through there here's Cain dressing everything up this is what your pastor is talking about be careful what your music you listen to he begins to make this beautiful beautiful stage this beautiful platform but you know what there wasn't no blood in it there wasn't no sacrifice for his sins in it and Adam and Eve would begin to go who told him that who told Abel that but you know what Abel had a receiving station on the inside of him that he could say this is the way back but God would come and speak lip to ear to Cain and he said just do as your brother does but you see he was on the wrong Channel you ever have a radio and you want to listen to a certain station but you can't you can't you can't zoom in over here on this station and listen to this station you got to be on the right Channel I said yes we can prove it too for in glory we've got a risen savior who sends it forth in the Holy Ghost reveals it and makes it positive therefore we got a sending station and a receiving station brother Branham says you know what that station says he says it says those things which are impossible are possible hey man brother Branham says every born-again child tonight comes through Abraham's blessing for it's the promise given to Abraham and every child of God that receives the Holy Spirit his pulsation is the same I'm looking for a city he said it isn't Los Angeles it isn't New York it isn't Louisville it's heaven and we confess that we are A peculiar people strangers because we're looking for something that we do not see but something on the control tower says it's there every church every every Redemptive blessing between here and there God promised to give it to us and we're walking we're pilgrims I don't care what so and so says I know something in me tells me it's real it's real something begins to pull Satan your bosom that says it's the truth what do you think that is raising up on the inside of you tonight it's a control tower then make ready you're coming out of there just as certain as I stand In This Moment to not poop it tonight don't look at what you see how bad I'm crippled how sick I am what the doctor said don't look at that look at the Unseen what God said before you feel any different before the pain leaves before the hand moves before the eye can see one sight get me yet make ready for it it's going to come as long as that pulsation begins to rise in your bosom in your heart where God sits on the control tower he said now this is where I get religious about this time and I think that the Holy Spirit can lead man and tell him things and make him act different and make him believe things and receive things that the world never could believe could happen there's something on the inside of us that when the world says you're crazy the world says you're losing your mind there's something on the inside of it that says I can't help but believe it I just want to say this before I go any further and I don't know why I feel like but I want to say I want you to realize something tonight you might have had a lot of problems you might have had a lot of struggles but guess what you're still here I've had every excuse in the world that I can think of to walk away from this I've been through false Doctrine I've been through churches that fell apart [Music] come on I've had family problems but you know what there's something on the inside of me that just keeps pulsating and Paul says and it says but I'm looking for a city it doesn't matter what comes in my way there's still a city there's still a city how many knows there's a city called Charlotte North Carolina not too far from it but you can't see it from right here but it's there you know what I'm sorry because Erica there could be someone you might never see it you have a visitor come in town but you have a revelation you've seen Charlotte North Carolina before and you begin to tell them it's there and that's how it is when the Holy Spirit begins to reveal some to our hearts we know there's a Charlotte North Carolina I can't see it right now but it's there and I'll tell you there is a Heaven There is a risen savior his name is Jesus Christ you say Seth have you ever seen him no not like that but I'll tell you what I've seen him in the power of his resurrection I've seen him move in a service before I've been standing there when I feel his presence come by and bump into me and encourage me we are the Seed of Abraham brother Branham said if you're a part of that seed that same pulsation runs through you Abraham out of Brethren himself what kind of seed was it he said it was a faith seed you wonder why you can't doubt you wonder why you can't give up you wonder why you don't give in how can you quit when you ain't got no quit in you you're not a quitter you're an overcomer to the overcomer when your name is in the Lamb's Book of Life not even you can take it out the devil can't take it out your mama can't take it out your daddy can't take it out the preacher can't take it out when it's in there Shield until the day of your Radiance you are sealed brother's sister when Satan gets there you're already filled we're the Seed of Abraham you say you really believe that even though you don't see it absolutely you're the Seed of Abraham what does that look like Sarah you feel any different no we got a promise [Music] [Applause] you say Seth coffee it looks worse than ever not be true with these eyes but I ain't looking through these eyes I hear something coming through the control tower saying I start to tune in I hear something going victory is mine victory is mine Victory today is mine I told Satan get thee behind before you know your foot starts tapping see this world ain't my home you know where I feel at home right here in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus this is the closest I get to home this is why I gotta be here and when things look wrong I stagger not at the promise of God I call those things which are not as though they were I'll sit here and I'll stand on the word of God why something in me if you can ever figure out it ain't you holding yourself you're gonna get somewhere with God when you can realize that it ain't your hand brother random said I ain't holding on to him but as long as he's old known to me I can have confidence [Applause] seat of Abraham [Applause] you say it looks bad you don't think it looked bad every single year that went by the Abraham The Fanatic that kept saying he's going to take a body change and have a son kept getting older and older and older you don't think Noah looked like a fanatic when he was building an ark in the rain never been a drop of rain but he wasn't looking at that he was looking at a city he was looking at a city whose Builder and maker was God funny how these men would act the same would do the most ridiculous things to the human eye were you man Abraham I'm sorry we ever doubted you Abraham now that you've got Isaac I I we really shouldn't have doubted you and man you're looking better than ever I tell you what you done took that body change you look awesome where are you how's it going anywhere anyways I'm going up the mountain to kill him you're doing what to Isaac God told me to go sacrifice him up on her on the mountain and you're gonna go up there and kill him God told me to you say what are you talking about does that not sound like the craziest thing you ever heard but here's the thing Abraham wasn't relying as on his own ability Abraham wasn't reliable about how he was feeling about it surely Isaac's looking around going where's the lamb and they start going up there and the willingness I love the type I'm going to tell you what if my daddy had a knife and we were going up a hill and I know there was no sacrifice I'm probably running back down the hill but he begins to walk up there with Isaac and you know Isaac is the type of Christ and he's sitting there and he says whatever makes my father happy I'm willing to lay her why because the very Seed of Abraham was in Isaac but while he was laying there you see Abraham wasn't looking at the condition Abraham wasn't looking at what he had to do he was looking at the promise God done promise me Isaac Isaac I want to have a talk with you son God done promise through my seed we're going to be blessed it can't end with you if you die it's over so see Abraham had such a faith that he was looking beyond the curtain he was looking beyond what he could see and say even if he dies and he lays there God will have to raise him up [Applause] the faith we are the Seed of Abraham you know another Seed of Abraham because isn't your seed shall not maybe not if not probably not could shall possess the Gate of every each all every single one of your enemies plural [Music] you say why Seth are you as strong as those Gates know but greater is he that is in me than those Gates that are in the world [Applause] you see there was one time I I love this brother Brandon says look at Joshua look at Joshua before one rock ever come out of the building of the walls of Jericho Joshua walked around the wall shouting the victory these might be these stories might become common to us but can you imagine a man and these tall walls are racing chariots around he's sitting there going victory there's that fanatic again believing the message of the hours that was told to him victory victory he know the walls was coming down he armed his men and walked around and around and around Jericho for seven days in full armor because he was looking at the Unseen it was a promise God made he said how much can you walk around a wheelchair how much can you walk around the cancer how much can you walk around sin shouting the victory if you're sick tonight if you're going through something you need to go ahead and start saying I have the victory it was a promise God made how much can you walk around sin shedding the victory that God gives the promise when you can see him who is invisible when that pulsation comes into your heart and Begins the pulse say I'm the Lord who heals all thy disease when you can see that everything else weakens away Joshua looked at the Unseen he walked around the walls believing it would happen it all depends on what you're looking at so tonight I say what are you looking at what were you looking at when you came in this building were you looking at your circumstances were you looking at your family that wasn't in church were you looking at your problems were you looking at your sickness or were you looking at God were you looking at his promises were you looking at his word if you were looking the wrong way I'll tell you a little bride don't get out of Step began to look back at the word of God and say God's word is faithful and true and guess what it don't matter how you feel about it either it's still the truth I begin to imagine that you know we might be going through a lot of jericholes in this life and if I could say it this way I believe Satan and laodicea specializes in building jerichos I believe he absolutely specializes in building spiritual jerichos it's not just little problems anymore Church it's big problems it's problems so big that when you first see it you go ma 'am now that I'm a country boy now that was like when I seen the the Bass Pro Shops in Tennessee that giant pyramid I said that is a big bass pro shops and I was looking at thing and I said my how did they even build that how'd they even do that and that's the way it is spiritually with our problems we don't have these little problems anymore you know why because you're maturing as Christians you know what makes you stronger trials you know what makes you better trials listen you don't get strong by rejoicing on the mountain you get strung by climbing out of the valley onto the mouth and they begin to sit there and they begin to look at that and I imagine when he first walked up to it he said my but then he seen a man standing there he drew a sword he said are you for us or against us and he said I'm the captain you know he began to remember a promise as I was with Moses so shall I be with you I give you the land I give you the land I give you the land Joshua footsteps is possession you might not understand it you might not know why you're going through it you might not even understand the trial but you just walk around it and when you walk around it don't just admire it but begin to sing a little tune and begin to praise God and begin to say thank you God for the victory and you know what you might have become to a Jericho that's so big you got family trapped in there you might have a little Rahab trapped in there somewhere you might have a little family that don't believe the way that you do but you're believing that God will bring them out you're believing that God will make a way for them you might you might have a little family that got caught up in sin and different things and you're you're walking around that wall and Satan is constantly boasting and bragging in your face you know what those chair if I can just type it in today those chariots walking around there are running around the top of that and they were boasting and bragging about how it is and Satan will begin to take your family down a road of sin next thing you know they're posting on Facebook doing things they would have never done he's bragging about it and posting in your face saying look what I've got your family to do look how far I've got them off the word look at all the things I've got them into he's sitting there boasting and breaking but you know what God commissioned Jericho uh uh Joshua to do he said don't worry about Jericho you just walk around it don't I listen can you imagine that every single day he began to walk around that building he was he wasn't just it wasn't just the children of Israel their Church there was Angels there was the captain of the host all sitting there I saw this illustration today give me some Grace but I was sitting there thinking can you imagine that they're just sitting there walking around the walls of Jericho and there's Angels lined up every single one of them got a stone right there on their hand just waiting for the captain to say pull the stone oh the stone give me some Grace it's just an illustration but they're sitting there saying just Jason wait boys not on day one not on day two and they're sitting there waiting to pull the stone and he said no not on day three wait I told him day seven I don't know why God didn't do it on day one but God said day seven wait until wait until [Applause] they begin to walk around singing that victory is mine victory is mine victory is mine Satan thought you were crazy because the walls were as tall as they ever been but don't worry there's a seventh day coming [Music] don't worry there's a seventh day coming and they begin to walk around if I could share this type real quick from from if my memory serves me right every single day they would walk around one time but on the seventh time they walked around seven times on the seventh day what was it it was the seventh Church age messenger going all the way back tying together all the Loose Ends from each and every age that we can stand in and say we know who we are we know where we came from Satan we know who we are tonight and on that seventh day when the trumpet began to sail they began to blow that trumpet those angels ran back those were all those Stone and Jericho came trembling now but don't you worry about your family in there can you imagine every single building fell down but there was one bill left standing there with a Scarlet robe headed now what was it that's the blood that you're putting over your family's life and you're not you say they're still living in sin but there's a blood there there's a token that I'm believing for them that no matter what they're going through know whether whether hey I'm believing for them tonight I don't know where you stand tonight if I'll give you got family in Jericho don't worry about it look at the victory look at the walls coming down they ain't gonna stay there forever [Applause] we got to confess it tonight [Music] through confession salvation is made you know Satan hates confession Satan hates confessions he hates it when he throws you through everything and you say I believe he's the god that healeth all my disease when he throws you through everything and maybe you're knocked on the ground and you say I'm an overcomer he hates it he can't stand it you know one time I was dealing with the case and there was a sister that she had she had an evil spirit on her and you know my buddy called me in the middle of the night and I went to go pray for her and when I got there she began to tell me I'm just I got so much fear over me about there's an evil spirit in this house and it's God on me and now I'm so scared I cannot shake it and I said well you know I read in the Bible they said lay hands on the sick and they shall recover cast out demons in my name all those things and I said now listen sis when we begin to pray for you this thing ain't just gonna give up this thing's gonna fight and I laid my hands on her and she started shaking and jerking and trying to get away from this in church don't you ever think demons ain't real let me tell you something you young people playing those video games and everything that are straight out of hell you better stay away from that stuff that ain't nothing but the devil you're just a dimension away from hell when they're playing those games watching those things you ought not to be watching glory to God I can't even remember where I was but but but but you begin to see that I begin she began to to try to get away from me that Spirit tried to pull her away from me and I was laying my hand on and I was praying for you know she opened her eyes and she looked at me and I seen him going like this scared to death but you know what I realized that wasn't her that was that devil and you know what I realized that devil wasn't scared of the preacher that devil was scared of the believer that devil was scared of the believer believing I said sis that devil ain't scared of me he's scared of you telling him to get out of your house the power of confession I'm going to tell you this if the preacher prays for you all night I don't do no good if you don't believe it too and she and she was she was there I hope this is all right brother Steve but but but she was sitting there and she and I told her I said he ain't scared of me he's scared of you can you imagine that the devil of fear was actually afraid of her Satan ain't nothing but a bluff he tries to make you think he's all this and that he ain't he's underneath your feet your seat shall possess see Satan and I have to sing don't have to care about my feelings he don't have to care about how I feel about it but he does have to obey this word and I said you need to tell him to get out of your house you know what the husband said I'll get the door so we stand her up and we want her over there and he opens the door and he said say it I said tell him to get out but he hates your confession and she began to go get gosh get get and I said tell him to get out of your house and she said get out of here devil and you felt the whole atmosphere change you've got to go what was it it's the Seed of Abraham that'll conquer every gate but you know what you got to confess it whatever you're going through if it doesn't line up with the word of God you have a right you have a right tonight he's my healer he's my deliverer he's my redeemer I don't feel it I don't feel it yet I don't feel it yet you've heard the story of John Ryan the blind man he went into one brother Brandon's means and brother Brandon had a vision and said you can see he couldn't see yet he went back around he said you told me that I could see and he said yeah and you told me that you believe me I wanted to church we come to church telling God we believe him we come to church and say God we believe you I believe you he said I thought you said you believe me he said you just go on confessing confession confession you just go on confessing and believing that you're healed keep speaking it John keep speaking to John they said I believe he would he would hand out papers and said Read All About It extra extra thank God for healing me you know what people thought he was crazy like they thought Abraham was crazy like they thought no it was crazy they see no John Ryan down there and they said hey let's go make fun of him he's the blind man that can see he's the blind man that can see so yeah they said he was in the barbershop and they said hey man hey man watch this I heard you went down that old Holy Ghost meeting John oh yeah I did he said we heard you got healed down there John he said yes I did thank God for healing me and about that time through the power of confession not about how he felt about it not about his current circumstance but he kept saying thank God for healing me thank God for healing me woke up that morning bumped into the table hurt his knee thank God for healing me begin to walk running to somebody on the street pardon me thank God for healing me I feel pretty good sitting there trying to step up on the concrete steps over hits his leg Falls right on his face before he ever gets up thank God for healing me [Music] but he said it long enough to the faith of Abraham to the seed of it what does a seed do it produces what's on the inside of it and that seed he began to wander it with the sunshine and the rain going thank God for healing me thank God for healing me you say how many times you're gonna say it till you get it thank God for healing me he was in that barber shop next thing you know thank God for healing those eyes came open he took off running down the street they were trying to chase him down our confession if these people here in these Wheelchairs and these cots and knew that sick to die if you could just hear the word of God tonight don't try to figure it out don't think how long you've been sitting how long you've been sick think about what God Said and there comes a pulsation from the Holy Spirit In Your Heart saying it's the truth how do you know it's the truth said the devil I know it's the truth it's God's word it's the truth something begins to pull Satan you're abusing that it's the truth then make ready you're coming out of there you should be able to Rejoice tonight if there is something inside of your heart that when the word of God has gone forth there is something Paul Satan inside of you saying that's the truth and you know before you know it you're that's the truth begins to get louder or amen begins to get louder why because Faith cometh by hearing and hearing the word faith there's that word again Faith cometh by hearing hearing of the word of God just as certain as I've seen in this movement and I don't look at what you see how bad I'm crippled how sick I am what the doctor said don't look at that look at the Unseen what God said before you feel any different before the pain leaves before the hand moves before the eye can see one sight make ready for it it's going to come you know Philippine says I'm told by aviators who fly these here real fast jet planes and they say that the plane getting up to a certain speed that it vibrates and Shakes and it seems like the bolts is going to fly out of it the wings are going to come off until they pass that sound barrier but after they once passed that sound barrier the plane begins just sails out just in the ease when it passes the sound barrier the obstacle that's in its way of the plane when it passes its own sound can I say if we could ever get past our own complaining when it passes its own sound and then runs at ease oh if the Church of this day could ever pray till they pass the sin barrier and the unbelief barrier they could shout the victory of the Living God when they once passed that barrier by looking at the Unseen and letting the world vibrate and do what it wants to but there is a living God and we when we lose our disbelief and our unbelief in him and pass that place the world is saying the days of Miracles has passed it makes you shake oh there's there's no such thing as the baptism of the Holy Ghost it makes you wonder but if you just look at the Unseen to the to to The God Who promised it for the promises unto you to your children and them that are far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call if you'll look to the Blessed word that says Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever turn your heads towards that press on until you pass that vibration past the unbelief barriers and sin bears and all the Bears that seem to hinder you then you'll file you'll fly free in the faith of God knowing that all things are possible Church we ain't never going to get anywhere off the ground with these weights all over us we ain't never going to be able to hit the speed that we can hit if we're not willing to let go of all this sin that we have in our hands and all that thank the devil said oh you're just born with that that's just your trial you'll deal with that for the rest of your life no you ain't got to you're the Seed of Abraham you don't have to look at that you can look at something different You Were Made to Fly You Were Made to Fly Above All of it all the pain all the heartache all the things you're going through You're Made to Fly Above It you ain't a maid to be sitting down here in the storm when you can be above the storm church one time I was coming back from Texas on an airplane and it was beautiful weather and we got to Charlotte and we dropped below the clouds and it was nothing but rain and storms and everything else and I was sitting there thinking glory to God even though I'm right here right now I know just beyond those clouds the sun is still shining I know just beyond those clouds when I seen that sun his mercies were new today we gotta look beyond our problems I couldn't see the Sun but it was there it was there you ain't made to be tied down Philippines had an eagle is made to get above that storm he's made to shed his wings and fly effortlessly it's already in you to do it you don't have to work it up you just have to believe God you just have to say God is your word you know when we were kids I'm still a kid but when we were little kids you know remember when the June bugs came in and those June bugs were made to fly but us evil kids we would take them and we would tie a string to them and they would try to take off and we'd have a string on them and you know that June bug Was Made to Fly but as long as there was weights attached to him I remember I had this one all day at my grandma's house watching it fly back and forth like it was a little kite you know and I'm sitting there and that he was determined to fly he was made to fly he didn't walk away from me he wanted to fly away from me but as long as that weight was on him he couldn't go more than three feet from me but at the end of the day my grandma said set those things free you know we had that thing on there and I cut that string you know why he was made for that he was built to fly but as long as these weights were on him and listen that wasn't his fault it wasn't his fault that somebody came around and tied a string on him and listen you might be born with this nature you might be born in this flesh you might be born to a place where you're bogged down but you ain't got to stay that way that's why God made a new birth so you can be born again that you can fly above that you don't want that very scripture it said they weren't able to obtain the promise they without us cannot be made perfect what bulls and goats could never do year after year they were making their sacrifices but church we ain't relying on the life of bulls and goats to come back on the believer we have the life of Jesus Christ through the Holy Ghost on the inside of the believer what can't you do tonight what's your excuse what is our excuse tonight [Music] and I preach from my heart for a minute you say I'm just feeling down tonight you ain't made to feel down you say I don't feel like the spirit of God is moving in church like it's supposed to whose fault is that come on get with me tonight I'm gonna kill this Spirit you say oh can you yeah there's been a lingering Spirit right here and we're going to kill it right now sitting here saying oh it just ain't moving like it used to and this that and the other well I'll tell you what I don't know if you still read the Bible but in the Bible it says he inhabits the Praises of his people you say I want to feel him I wish he was here who changed he said I'm God and I change not you ought to fail God get up out of your seat and praise God thank him for what he did for you thank him for what he brought you out of you were miserable you were a sinner when nobody cared for you Jesus cared for you those people out there ain't got a right to praise him like you got a right to praise it [Applause] God open up your heart God Gave You Grace that you could say this wonderful message he gave you Grace that you could live above the problems of life he sent you a comforter when nothing would comfort you [Applause] but as long as we're looking at the problem we'll never see the problem solver praise God [Applause] if we can just look at the Healer tonight [Applause] stop looking at your problems they're temporal they ain't gonna last they ain't gonna last you ain't gonna stay there forever you can't everything you're seeing how you're feeling what you're going through I'm here to tell you it ain't gonna last you're a Believer tonight you're a winner winner you say what do you mean a winner winner here so let's take an example here tonight you say well I'm sick if God heals you you're a winner if you go by the grave you're going to have a better body than you ever have you're a winner winner tonight [Applause] I don't know about y'all but I ain't no Loser tonight I'm a winner I'm a hand pick overcoming son of the most high God Satan don't believe it people don't believe it but I believe it because the faith of Abraham is put on the inside of me it's on the inside of you tonight I tell you what church I'm feeling that atmosphere starts to change I'm feeling people begin to believe God blessed be the name of the Lord I tell you I don't know about y'all but I'm beginning to feel a charge bump into me every now and then it reminds me of the time when Elisha and gehaza we're standing there and the enemy might have came in the enemy might have been disrupted in your whole week your whole month your whole year the king of Syria might decide to make war against this Tabernacle but one thing the king of Syria don't know is God's in his bed chamber Hallelujah I wonder how many times Satan made a plan for this church how I'm going to destroy this church how I'm going to bring this church down but every time he would come in the house of God and make this wonderful plan to overthrow you here comes an evangelist a preacher that don't know nothing about you and Satan's going who told him which one of y'all told him the plan because God is in the enemy's bad chamber and I want you to know tonight you ain't alone fighting this battle you ain't alone finding this battle you felt that surge of energy you felt yourself bounce into something what is that that's angels all around us fighting the battle pushing out the enemy I say this tonight whose side are you on as Joshua said whose side are you on all I can tell you this my wife's back there for me and my house we're gonna serve the Lord you might not see them but the angels are here you might not see it but they're here Jesus said what are we going to do we're outnumbered the enemies all around Elijah said God open his eyes one time he began to open his eyes when he opened his eyes that didn't put the Angels there he just seen what was already there blessed be the name of the Lord I feel good now yes I feel that breakthrough now Hallelujah you know there was a sister just beginning of the year and she came up for prayer and we began to pray for her she came up to me and she said I've got arthritis all in my arms I said you do she said yeah I said well do you believe Jesus Christ is still the same yesterday today and forever do you believe that that same Jesus that raised Lazarus from the dead is still the Jesus right here in this church right now and she said absolutely I believe it and we begin to pray for her and blessed be the name of the Lord you know what she looked past you know what she was doing she was breaking past that arthritis barrier she was breaking past that unbelief barrier and she came out of that and she met me outside of that church she began to threw her arm up and down like this she said every bit of the pain has left me why because we're Abraham's see tonight where the Royal Seed of Abraham there's no cure for arthritis there's one there's no cure for cancer there's one Hallelujah there's no way that a wretched sinner like me can be saved there's one there's one mediator between God and man and his name is Christ Jesus there's one Healer there's one high priest that can be touched by the feeling of our infirmities Hallelujah whatever you're going through Jesus has done been through it [Music] however you're feeling Jesus already knows Jesus was talked about Jesus was thrown around Jesus was beat down Jesus was spitting his faith Jesus was hung on a cross and you know what he said it is finished that the life of God could come back on the believer [Applause] look around at your neighbor they weren't holding themselves the life of God came back on the believer we're over commerce tonight [Music] God already prepared this is my message to the church God's already prepared for this everyone listen before Satan was ever created and ever knew what was going on God already had a plan for this this day did not catch God by surprise tomorrow will not catch God by surprise but it will catch Satan by surprise why in the world did he call That Little Country Boy Can't hardly even read his Bible to come up there and he walked because it ain't me God has a plan I hope this is speaking to your heart tonight God can I tell you a little testimony and I'm going to try to close here shortly but you know there was one time where Stephen I had a sermon planned prepped ready to go we had figured it out I was before God and right before I went to sleep God said and I was going to preach on uh uh what was that no Abraham Lincoln gave pardon I was going to preach on a pardon and then right before I went to speak all God gave me was preach on uh preach on God Will Make A Way and I'm sitting there and I'm like well God you know I really studied all this out you know all my reasons why I can't do what God's telling me to do I hope it's all right for me just to be myself to y'all I love you y'all were like family to me I'm home I'm home and and you know it said God Will Make A Way so right before I go to sleep I get I get like one scripture and two quotes and I'm sitting there going well God's gonna have to make a way and and and and you know what it was though that night as soon as God told me that I I could I didn't see the sister but I felt and my wife's a witness of this I felt this sister's pain where she was trapped and she couldn't get out and I said she's tried and in my mind this is what was coming she's tried over and over to get out let her know there's a way and and I told my wife in the car on the way down there I told her that same thing I said now I don't claim I told her I said I don't claim to have discernment I don't claim those things I believe every holy ghost person has an amount of discernment in him but when you can when the when you have the control tower and it began to speak to my heart and and it began to say there's a sister down there if he feels trapped she feel like she can't get out and I said honey I just want to tell you this now so after it's done I'm you're going to be a witness of it that I just didn't say that when I was coming down here in church I went I went down there and we began to preach and you know at the end of that I'd be preaching on that way maker and we were sitting there and we were oh God would make a way and and then and then I was sitting there going man I wonder if I know that song way maker and at the end of the service they never even they talked about singing it two weeks ago but they never sang it and that was the very first time that they sing it in that church was way maker and then they began to sing that I could still go free and about that time this woman began to let out a shout what a tremendous service today she posted this after the service God was so real I can't let this opportunity go without giving a testimony for almost four years I have been battling something that not many people have known about it wasn't just depression and anxiety but it was different and I was tormented with this every single day at times I didn't I don't think at times I didn't think I had the strength to go on and I didn't think I'd ever break away from it well today I am free we were singing that I could still go free God came down and I literally felt it leave my body it's gone the devil didn't want me to make this post the power of confession the devil didn't want me to make this post but I'm sitting here shaking as I type it all out but he can't take away what he did for me I'm going to tell you what if I can encourage you with anything tonight if you're sick of that Spirit that's limiting your praise if you're sick of that that keeps holding you down you just remember he can't ever take away what God done for you gotta leave my body I didn't want to make this post I'm sitting here saying I type it all out he can't take away what he did for me he showed me today that he loves me and always has no amount of saying Thank You Lord will ever be enough truly is he is our way maker you don't know like what I know what he's done for me [Applause] I'm here to tell you tonight stop looking at those problems look at the promise I'm gonna read this and I'm gonna quit I promise [Music] well Brandon Begin to talk about John when he was in prison now when these disciples came to Jesus with this great prophet's message Jesus never said to them now I'll tell you what I'll do I'll send you some some literature to give to John on how to be happy in jail I love brother Brandon he never said that he didn't he didn't say I'll give you a book on patience and tell John how to be patient while he's in jail it's a good thing he said he's in jail I hate to see him in jail but I'll tell him how how to do it just to be happy no he never said that you know what he said he said just stay till this afternoon's meeting just stay over then you can leave after that just watch this afternoon's meeting and after Jesus had the meeting I'd imagine those Disciples of John sitting there watching every move he made because John had taught them what the Messiah was and told them what it was and these was his disciples and he began and they began to see what was what has taken place so then after the service was over then when those two disciples went back to John he said go tell John the lame walk the blind sea the deaf here and all that comes to the meeting is poor all the poor people got the gospel preached to them and tell John not to be scared don't think anything different listen Church listen to this I'm right on schedule everything's running right everything's all right I'm right on schedule go tell him there's healing service going on the Poor's got the gospel preached the power of God is moving among them I'm right on schedule don't pay any attention to nothing else I'm on schedule [Music] [Applause] it don't matter how you're feeling tonight God's on schedule God's got a schedule that he always keeps the Lord is not slack concerning his promises as some men count slackness [Music] he's still a Healer everything I'm is going to plan [Music] lazarus's family said you're four days late I'm on time he's already dead I'm on time I feel like every man presses into this listen you might go through struggles you might go through trials you might go through tribulations but you know what that never changes that your son and daughter of God you should have battled was this for so long but listen God has a special service just for you you don't have to understand God you just have to trust him if you would like to come back to the music and close and I'll tell this there was a brother Branham tells a story and there was a woman that she she had this baby and its foot was tilted upwards and it couldn't never wear a pair of shoes and brother Branham said this woman came and and she had a parish she had to pair of shoes with her and she said I believe brother Branham if you just lay your hands on this baby he said and it'll be well and she went up to him and he said do you require a vision of me and she said no not a vision just lay your hands on it and the baby will be well well they took the baby after he laid his hands on it and nothing happened they came back later and said something was wrong something something something didn't go right brother Brown and he said no no no no no no you said you believed and he said and I'm paraphrasing here but brother Branham says in a quote he says the problem ain't with the word the problem ain't with God's promises the problem is with he said you see there ain't nothing wrong with God's word there ain't nothing wrong with his promises but she had in her mind how God should do it she had it figured out how God should do it and when she went up to God or when she went up to brother Branham he said no no there ain't nothing wrong you said you believed and he said she said can I just ask you one thing brother Branham and he said what is that do you believe it's God's will for my baby to be crippled and he said no I don't believe that and she said that's all I need he said blessed are those who are not offended in me and she went on believing listen church as far as I know it didn't happen the next day it didn't happen the day after that brother Brandon was telling the story like it happened a long time ago and he said just the other day she came up to me and said look God has healed his foot listen don't be offended at God because the way that you planned everything out didn't go the way that you thought it should be God's Got A Plan God's got a day for you God has everything in control yes my brothers yesterday I'm going to skip that story and I just want to say this tonight in closing don't look at the problem if there's Faith pulsating in your heart saying Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever don't you worry about what the world's saying don't even worry about what the church is saying don't worry about anything but what the word of God says you take that word because I want to tell you I'll use my own church if God tarries and for some reason all the people die often an Apostolic Tabernacle is no more this word will still be the same we can rely on this word no matter what it will come to pass I want to keep going but I must close I love you I appreciate each and every one of you I pray that it was a blessing and I pray for you while I'm gone [Applause] let's give him a big clap offer amen amen this is what we like people that get out of the way and they just them and they preach the way God built them amen that's the best way God can use you just be yourself and let it because he knows the way he wired you and he knows how he's going to use you to be a blessing for somebody now you feel encouraged do you see what he was doing trying to block you from a blessing making you tired thinking about this thinking about this worrying about this worrying about this complaining about this and this and this why are you the Seed of Abraham amen don't look at the problem stop looking at the problem amen everything is on schedule [Music] everybody good I don't even worry about this church because I didn't start it that's why I go to sleep I didn't start it I'm not even the one running it that takes the pressure off of you [Applause] I am just a servant amen and everything is under control there is no weapon form against this church that will prosper God chose you to prove himself I don't know if you get me God just chose you and say I'm gonna use you to prove that this message here is completely correct and it's the true message so you are standing here as a witness proving that this message is right who would have thought amen the boss has everything in control he got everything figured out don't worry about it keep confessing everything will be okay amen don't look at the destruction don't get in what is going on here and there or on TV or things went up the market is not good whatever is going on this is the time we need to focus more on the word of God and on the Promises of God whatever happened there God have the power to change it don't look at the problem don't team up in the wrong environment you're going to block your blessing stay consecrated stay in prayer stay in a good atmosphere look at the promises of God God will get you completely free everybody good let's stand and pray remember Saturday and you pray for me and you pray for one another everything will be okay Hallelujah we got a seed in US and that seed was predestinated it is the word of God it will never fail amen amen the seed talking to the seed it has nothing to do with you and that seed would never never fail God ambushed the devil by the predestinated seed and sometime when the devil look at you you don't even you didn't even look like a son of God amen sometimes he disfigure you disfigure you by the the hair you were wearing and by everything but down deep into whatever you were before there was a predestinated seed and when the Lord touched that seed here you are if you show picture you show the people the picture of what you were before and what you are now people won't even believe it it was not you it is God looking for his seed amen be
