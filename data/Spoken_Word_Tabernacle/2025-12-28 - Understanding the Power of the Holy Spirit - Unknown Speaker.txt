TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] We had a wonderful service &gt;&gt; this Wednesday. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the Holy Spirit came down &gt;&gt; and some of you received the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; On Wednesday, &gt;&gt; are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? The Lord open up a door to outpour the Holy Ghost on someone. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen. &gt;&gt; And it was a wonderful service. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Because brother Tony was used by God to come straight with a sermon that is called receive ye the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Are we together? It was a special grace by God that brought the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; But I WANT YOU TO BE VERY CAREFUL. &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit doesn't come only with a sermon that is called HOLY GHOST. [Applause] AMEN. &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; BECAUSE MESSAGE BELIEVER are used to tradition. &gt;&gt; They were here. We have to preach. WHAT IS THE HOLY GHOST? &gt;&gt; WHAT WAS THE HOLY GHOST GIVEN FOR? HOW DO YOU RECEIVE IT? And we need TO MAKE A LONG PRAYER line to LAY HAND ON THE PEOPLE TO RECEIVE THE HOLY GHOST. &gt;&gt; BUT GOD CAME ON THE WEDNESDAY AND BROUGHT THE HOLY GHOST. THE HOLY GHOST IS ALWAYS AVAILABLE IN EVERY SERMON. &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; THE BIBLE SAYS THIS. I WAS TALKING TO MY WIFE ABOUT THIS. THE BIBLE SAYS in the book of John chapter 6 verse 63, he say it is the what? &gt;&gt; Spirit &gt;&gt; that does what? &gt;&gt; That quickenth. &gt;&gt; The flesh does what? &gt;&gt; PROFERETH NOTHING. THE WORDS THAT I SPEAK UNTO YOU, &gt;&gt; not the written word. [Applause] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. NOT THE WRITTEN WORD. &gt;&gt; You didn't get me well. &gt;&gt; YOU TRADITIONALIST. &gt;&gt; NOT THE WRITTEN WORD. &gt;&gt; THE LETTER. [Applause] NOT THE WORD THAT IS WRITTEN, BUT THE WORD THAT I SPEAK TO YOU, &gt;&gt; THE SPOKEN WORD, THE SERMON, THE PREACHING, THE TEACHING, &gt;&gt; WHEN A MINISTER IS PREACHING, WHEN A MINISTER IS ANOINTED AND HE BEGIN TO PREACH THE WORD THAT IS COMING UP OFF THE PASTOR BECAUSE IT'S NO LONGER THE PASTOR, IT IS GOD THAT HAVE TAKEN OVER THE VESSEL. WHEN THE WORD IS COMING OUT, &gt;&gt; THOSE WORD THEY ARE WHAT? &gt;&gt; SPIRIT. &gt;&gt; THE WORD THAT I SPEAK TO YOU, THEY ARE WHAT? &gt;&gt; SPIRIT. &gt;&gt; SO THE SON HAVE THE HOLY GHOST. &gt;&gt; I HOPE WE ARE TOGETHER. &gt;&gt; I HOPE WE ARE TOGETHER. &gt;&gt; THE WORD THAT I SPEAK TO YOU ARE WHAT? &gt;&gt; SPIRIT &gt;&gt; AND WHAT? &gt;&gt; LIFE. SO WHERE IS THE SPIRIT AND THE LIFE? &gt;&gt; SO WHEN THE WORD IS COMING, &gt;&gt; THE HOLY GHOST IS THERE. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. IN OTHER WORDS, WHEN YOU ARE RECEIVING THE WORD, YOU ARE RECEIVING THE HOLY GHOST. YOU ARE RECEIVING GOD. [Applause] WHEN THE HOLY GHOST IS COMING IN THE ANOINTED WORD OF THE HOUR. &gt;&gt; WHEN YOU RECEIVE THE HOLY GHOST, &gt;&gt; YOU RECEIVE THE MESSAGE, YOU RECEIVE THE WORD THAT HAS BEEN SPOKEN. THAT WORD GOT THE SPIRIT OF GOD AND HE GOT THE LIFE OF GOD INSIDE. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. I'M RAISING YOU UP ABOVE PENTECOSTAL. I'M RAISING YOU UP ABOVE LAYING ON HAND. &gt;&gt; WHEN THE WORD IS BEEN PREACHED, YOU DON'T HAVE TO WAIT AT THE END &gt;&gt; TO PRAY FOR THE HOLY GHOST. &gt;&gt; WHEN GOD IS SPEAKING ABOUT THE HOLY GHOST THROUGH BROTHER TONY, ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS STAND UP &gt;&gt; AND SAY, "LORD, I RECEIVE IT." [Applause] [Music] ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; THIS IS BEYOND SENSATION. &gt;&gt; YES, SIR. &gt;&gt; AND IT'S IMPORTANT FOR YOU TO RECEIVE THE WORD THAT WAY &gt;&gt; BECAUSE SENSATION MAY OR MAY NOT BE &gt;&gt; AND THE DEVIL WILL CONTINUE TO PLAY AROUND UPON YOUR FEELING. I DON'T FEEL GOD TODAY. I FEEL ANOINTED. I DON'T FEEL ANOINTED. WE DON'T WANT THAT. &gt;&gt; WHETHER I FEEL GOD OR NOT, I KNOW GOD IS IN ME. I KNOW GOD IS IN MY LIFE. I CAN WALK WITH GOD. I KNOW HIM. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? OR I FEEL GOOSEBUMP. WHAT ABOUT IF YOU DIDN'T feel goosebump? NOW YOU STUCK AND THE DEVIL WILL TELL YOU YOU DON'T HAVE IT. &gt;&gt; DEVIL IS NOT IN MY FLESH. &gt;&gt; THAT IS THE FIRST POOL. &gt;&gt; IT IS NOT IN MY SPIRIT. THAT'S THE SECOND POOL. IT IS SOMETHING WAY BEYOND IN MY SOUL &gt;&gt; THAT AGREE WITH THE WORD OF GOD FOR MY TIME. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; I'M LEAVING THE AIRPORT, MY FRIEND. KEEP YOUR SEAT BELT. THE AIRPLANE IS GOING ON LIKE THIS. WHENEVER WE PREACHING THE WORD, YOU ARE AVAILENT. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] and Pentecostal tradition &gt;&gt; receive the Holy Ghost. Receive the Holy Ghost and they push you even they push you and then you fell and then you didn't feel anything &gt;&gt; because you have another expectation. &gt;&gt; You have a wrong interpretation. &gt;&gt; Who lay hand on who on the day of Pentecost? &gt;&gt; ANSWER MY QUESTION. WHO LAY HAND on who on the day of Pentecost? Who was Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; WHO lay hand ON THE DAY OF PENTECOST? &gt;&gt; BECAUSE JESUS PHYSICAL WAS NOT THERE. THAT'S WHY BROTHER BRANDHAM SAID ONE DAY IT WON'T BE THE LAYING ON HAND.
