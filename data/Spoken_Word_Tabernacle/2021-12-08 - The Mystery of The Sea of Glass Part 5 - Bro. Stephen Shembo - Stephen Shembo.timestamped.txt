[40:27] there
[40:30] melchizedek
[40:33] king of salem we know he's king of salem
[40:35] he brought bread and wine
[40:38] i hope we can reach bread and wine
[40:42] amen amen
[40:44] and he was depreased you might be seated
[40:48] let me try to close this off and then
[40:50] start a backup again
[40:54] a funny nose is it okay now
[40:58] if not i switch to the bazooka
[41:01] is it better
[41:03] okay
[41:05] i can feel i can hear it in my ear
[41:08] coming back
[41:10] the devil
[41:14] he tried the first thing on me i said
[41:17] and i was about to take an
[41:18] over-the-counter medication and say no
[41:20] i'm not gonna take it then he goes then
[41:22] he flips something else on me
[41:24] then i pray it's gone
[41:26] then i get here he start attacking the
[41:28] computer
[41:30] now the computer is working now he's in
[41:32] the sand
[41:36] oh my what is he trying to block tonight
[41:39] [Music]
[41:41] and melkissa the king of salem
[41:44] brought forth bread and wine
[41:46] and he was the priest of the most high
[41:50] god
[41:51] we know already that melchizedek is a
[41:53] king
[41:55] but the scripture never says that mercy
[41:58] is a high priest
[42:04] am i reading a different bible
[42:06] can you check your bible
[42:08] the bible didn't say melchizedek high
[42:10] priest
[42:12] he was a priest
[42:13] he was depressed
[42:16] so who's the high priest
[42:22] he was the priest of the most high god
[42:25] and he blessed him and said blessed be
[42:29] abraham of the most high god
[42:32] possessor of heaven and earth
[42:34] and blessed be the most high god which
[42:36] has delivered your enemy into your hand
[42:39] and he gave him
[42:42] tithe of all everybody clear so far
[42:45] let's go to psalm 110 again
[42:58] if you're there you can say amen
[43:04] i hope somebody is awake
[43:06] amen amen
[43:08] the lord has sworn
[43:10] and will not repent
[43:12] you
[43:14] everybody
[43:16] are a priest so there is somebody else
[43:18] here
[43:19] that god didn't call him high priest
[43:25] is the next an unknown person
[43:28] and that person
[43:30] is called a priest
[43:33] so this one a priest under melchizedek
[43:37] melchizedek a priest where is the high
[43:40] priest
[43:42] amen
[43:45] hallelujah
[43:46] you are a priest forever
[43:49] he is not just a priest
[43:52] but he is a priest forever
[43:56] why forever
[43:59] amen
[44:00] you are a priest forever
[44:02] after we already know after means like
[44:05] or in the simulation after the order of
[44:09] melchizedek what does it mean to be a
[44:12] priest
[44:13] forever under the order of melchizedek
[44:15] what does he mean
[44:17] let's go to hebrew chapter seven
[44:21] the book of hebrew is wide open
[44:25] amen
[44:30] amen
[44:31] blessed be the name of the lord just
[44:34] relax
[44:35] we will be okay
[44:36] don't be tense
[44:38] if you go tense then you miss it if you
[44:40] just relax then it's something
[44:43] amen
[44:46] hebrew chapter seven if you dare you can
[44:48] say a man
[44:50] verse 15
[44:52] in the book of psalms they say he's a
[44:54] priest forever
[44:55] now paul is explaining that because the
[44:57] hebrew give us more
[44:59] light about melchizedek amen
[45:03] and
[45:04] it is yet far more evident
[45:08] that for
[45:09] that after the simulated you see that
[45:13] after the likeness
[45:14] after the simulated
[45:17] of melchizedek
[45:19] there arises another priest
[45:22] we have a levitical priesthood existing
[45:25] but paul is saying that it was necessary
[45:28] that another priest
[45:30] comes up
[45:32] but that priest when he come on the
[45:34] scene he must look like melchizedek
[45:38] amen
[45:41] verse 16 who is made hey marquise
[45:46] not after the law of carnal commandment
[45:49] that's the levitical priesthood
[45:52] but after the power of an endless life
[45:57] because we know melchizedek have no
[45:59] beginning of days
[46:01] no ending of life
[46:02] no father no mother so melchizedek this
[46:06] priest and king is eternal
[46:09] anybody here
[46:10] and the one that they spoke of in psalm
[46:14] 110 they say also that he also have the
[46:18] power of endless life
[46:21] in other words this person also is
[46:24] eternal
[46:26] everybody care
[46:27] yet they say that he is after like
[46:30] melchizedek
[46:33] here
[46:35] let's go to verse 17
[46:37] for
[46:38] the power of endless life
[46:40] everybody for he testifies
[46:44] you are a priest everybody
[46:48] forever after the order of melchizedek
[46:52] i want to go back again so you
[46:54] understand what is going on here
[46:56] let's go back to verse 16.
[46:59] put your seatbelt
[47:01] who is made
[47:03] not after the law of corner commandment
[47:06] everybody here
[47:07] but after the power of an endless life
[47:12] so this man is eternal
[47:14] and to prove that he's eternal
[47:17] now paul is giving us a scripture that
[47:21] is backing up the fact that this man is
[47:24] eternal amen america and the scripture
[47:27] paul is giving us is psalm 110
[47:31] now verse 17 paul is giving the
[47:33] scripture he said for he testifies
[47:37] is what
[47:38] he's testifying that this man is eternal
[47:42] but how did he testify that this man is
[47:45] eternal in the old testament he
[47:48] testified that this man is eternal by
[47:50] saying this that you are a priest
[47:53] forever
[47:55] everybody here so when god said you are
[47:58] a priest forever
[48:00] ever here he was speaking about this
[48:03] priest being
[48:04] eternal amen did i lose somebody
[48:08] oh you want me to repeat again
[48:10] we're clear
[48:12] okay so this priest has the power of
[48:15] endless life or this priest is eternal
[48:18] so when we say he is a priest forever
[48:20] meaning you're not going to change this
[48:22] feast
[48:23] this priest will never die this priest
[48:25] ever started already existed and
[48:28] continue to exist that's why they say
[48:31] forever meaning that there is a power of
[48:34] endless life of deep or this priest is
[48:37] eternal
[48:39] so if this one is eternal
[48:42] this one is eternal how many priests do
[48:44] we have
[48:48] by where is the high priest
[48:52] because the bible didn't say that he was
[48:54] a high priest
[48:55] the bible didn't say that this one also
[48:58] is a high priest the bible just said
[49:00] these two look alike
[49:03] and this is eternal this is eternal but
[49:05] we know that there is one person that is
[49:07] eternal who is
[49:10] amen
[49:12] here
[49:13] verse 18 for there is verily a
[49:16] disarnoling
[49:18] of the commandment going before for the
[49:21] weakness
[49:23] and an
[49:24] unprofitableness thereof that's the law
[49:28] verse 19 for the law made nothing
[49:31] perfect you remember this now
[49:33] we spoke about this on sunday but
[49:35] they're bringing in of a better hope
[49:38] the law was pointing to something
[49:40] amen
[49:41] the law was telling us that one day
[49:43] heaven will come down
[49:46] so the lord duplicate heaven first
[49:49] as a copy but it was the it was not the
[49:52] original so the law was saying one day
[49:55] the original
[49:56] will come down amen
[49:59] for the lord made nothing perfect but
[50:02] they're bringing in of a better hope
[50:05] did
[50:06] by the which we draw night to god that's
[50:09] the second testament amen
[50:12] verse 20 and in as much as not without
[50:15] enough
[50:16] he was made a priest for those priests
[50:19] were made without enough so under the
[50:21] levitical prison the priests
[50:25] were uh
[50:26] uh appointed to their office without
[50:28] enough
[50:30] as long as you leave out you under the
[50:32] lineage of aaron automatically you have
[50:34] preached you can go ahead and do it
[50:36] except if you have a defect
[50:40] if you have an impediment or one leg is
[50:43] shorter than the other it's a problem
[50:45] but melchizedek take care of it
[50:49] amen
[50:51] for those priests were made without
[50:54] enough that's the levitical priest but
[50:56] this
[50:57] this one under melchizedek with enough
[51:00] by him that said unto him the lord saw
[51:05] amen how can the lord sow on this one
[51:09] the lord saw and will not repent god
[51:11] will not change again we back again in
[51:14] psalm 110 in hebrew everybody
[51:17] the lord so and will not repent you are
[51:20] a priest forever
[51:22] after the order of melchizedek
[51:26] the first reading melchizedek the king
[51:28] and priest not the high priest brought
[51:31] his son bread and wine melchizedek is
[51:34] eternal without beginning of day with
[51:36] our ending with our mother with our
[51:38] father everybody
[51:39] but on psalm 110 we find somebody that
[51:42] is unknown who is a priest after
[51:45] the order of melchizedek this person
[51:48] also is eternal
[51:50] and when they appointed him a priest
[51:54] they appointed him a priest with enough
[51:57] everybody here
[51:58] why did they give him enough verse 22
[52:02] by so much was
[52:05] jesus
[52:06] do you have your bible amen
[52:11] i heard you here under the anointing
[52:15] okay
[52:17] all right
[52:18] by so much was jesus
[52:21] everybody
[52:22] made water
[52:24] so paul is saying here that this unknown
[52:28] person here
[52:29] is who
[52:35] so
[52:36] if this man is jesus
[52:39] we must check the qualities of
[52:44] melchizedek you hear me
[52:47] and make sure jesus have the same
[52:50] qualities
[52:52] if not jesus is not mercy
[53:01] did you hear me
[53:02] i wish the whole church was here
[53:05] he said by so much was jesus made a
[53:09] surety
[53:11] or a guarantee
[53:13] of a better testament so god wanting to
[53:16] express to us that on this work here on
[53:20] the levitical priesthood i'm not
[53:22] guaranteeing anything
[53:24] because it's the blood of bulls and
[53:26] goats but under this covenant here i
[53:29] take my seal and i put it right there
[53:32] that's why you heard jesus saying that
[53:35] he have the father seal
[53:38] in other words the approval segment of
[53:41] the father all the intelligence of god
[53:45] was locked in the masterpiece called
[53:48] jesus christ
[53:50] in other words if jesus fell
[53:52] god fell
[53:54] so god made sure
[53:57] god made sure that his entire
[54:00] let me explain it to you
[54:03] if you have gm
[54:06] okay
[54:07] gm has a lot of cars you have malibu
[54:12] you have uh
[54:13] uh what is it uh chevy
[54:16] you have uh what do you call it uh
[54:20] gmc
[54:21] and you have cadillac there is three of
[54:23] them right
[54:25] you're going to learn something today
[54:27] ever here
[54:29] so the normal basic
[54:32] category of gm is chevy
[54:38] anybody here
[54:39] if you want to go a little bit this is
[54:41] regular
[54:42] so i'm going to help you up this is like
[54:44] guys regular
[54:46] have i got a clear
[54:47] you got chevy you're on a regular about
[54:50] here if you want to go on the plus 89
[54:54] do you hear me
[54:56] am i losing somebody
[54:58] if you want to go on the plus you get
[55:00] the gmc
[55:02] anybody here
[55:04] if you watch the the suburban of uh
[55:08] chevrolet
[55:09] chevy and gmc they all look alike
[55:13] outside
[55:14] their body looks exactly the same what
[55:17] is different is just a little future but
[55:19] it's one company making that up
[55:22] you hear me and then if you want to go
[55:24] to premium
[55:28] what do you get
[55:29] you get a cadillac
[55:32] everybody ever here so on the cadillac
[55:37] this is the top the highest point
[55:40] that gmc that gm can achieve
[55:44] everybody here
[55:45] so when gm is designing cadillac
[55:49] he finished his entire
[55:52] intelligence
[55:53] into cadillac
[55:55] if you want to see the top of gm you got
[55:57] to get in cadillac and he made sure that
[56:00] cadillac should be higher compared to
[56:03] the other car
[56:04] because this is his signature
[56:07] you hear me
[56:08] so god also
[56:10] when he was making christ that's why
[56:12] brother branham preached the message
[56:15] peace
[56:17] everybody
[56:18] when god was designing his masterpiece
[56:22] god took his entire
[56:24] intelligence and put it in jesus christ
[56:30] everybody here so if you want to see god
[56:34] in his supreme intelligence
[56:36] you need to meet the man jesus christ
[56:39] [Music]
[56:41] everybody
[56:42] if you really want to know how god think
[56:46] how god reacts
[56:48] how god talks
[56:49] how god eat
[56:51] just go see jesus christ
[56:55] [Applause]
[56:56] because jesus was the visible image
[57:01] of the
[57:02] invisible god
[57:05] if you never that's why he said philip
[57:08] wait a minute all this time you never
[57:11] understood that if you see me
[57:15] you see who
[57:17] in other words if you go to heaven
[57:19] you're going to see a house if you get
[57:22] in our house you'll see a big picture
[57:25] and that picture that you will see there
[57:27] is the owner of the house when you get
[57:29] to heaven that picture will look like
[57:31] this one
[57:32] [Applause]
[57:36] everybody here so when they say
[57:39] the lamb he's sitting on the right hand
[57:41] of god it doesn't mean god is sitting
[57:44] here and jesus is on the right hand
[57:45] catholicism
[57:50] anybody here
[57:51] if john search around in heaven
[57:54] and could not see jesus christ
[57:56] by the mic and he searched on the earth
[57:59] and could not see jesus christ and he
[58:01] went in there under the heaven and jesus
[58:04] christ was not there then somebody told
[58:07] him jesus is there
[58:09] where was hiding jesus
[58:12] where was jesus then
[58:16] who was on the throne
[58:18] why john didn't see him on the throne
[58:27] let's pray
[58:30] you warm up pretty good now
[58:34] heavenly father lord we are approaching
[58:37] you again humbly tonight
[58:39] father thanking you for everything
[58:42] your grace your love your mercy
[58:44] and everything that you have been doing
[58:46] for us
[58:48] father we are committing ourselves unto
[58:49] the hand tonight and we have done what
[58:52] every man that you have given a normal
[58:55] ability to do can do but when it comes
[58:58] to blessing your children imparting
[59:00] eternal life or further decoding the
[59:03] scripture it's only one person that can
[59:06] do it that was the lamb who was found
[59:08] worthy to take the book and to break the
[59:11] seal to look their own lord father and
[59:13] to free us from the work of darkness
[59:16] father may you move me completely out of
[59:18] the way may you come and anoint us lord
[59:21] father like never before and speak to us
[59:23] all and bless your children even those
[59:25] that are streaming in the name of jesus
[59:28] christ
[59:29] amen
[59:31] god bless you we are going up with part
[59:33] five
[59:37] we're still dealing with the priest
[59:39] when we finish the priest that will get
[59:41] into the clothing of the priest lord's
[59:44] willing amen blessed be the name of the
[59:47] lord now
[59:48] we saw that the mystery of deliver
[59:53] is a mystery that goes with the
[59:55] priesthood
[59:58] it is not just like a pool or a or uh
[1:00:02] like a basin where somebody come and
[1:00:03] wash their hand and go there is more to
[1:00:06] it because when god does something there
[1:00:08] is always a message behind it everybody
[1:00:12] and we found that the lever is always in
[1:00:15] connection with the priesthood everybody
[1:00:18] here
[1:00:19] it's in connection with the priesthood
[1:00:21] why because when they made the lever at
[1:00:23] first it was for the priest to wash the
[1:00:25] hand
[1:00:26] and
[1:00:28] and then to wash their feet
[1:00:30] about here and from there on we saw
[1:00:32] where foot washing started
[1:00:36] ever here
[1:00:37] blessed be the name of the lord then we
[1:00:39] found out that under the same level the
[1:00:42] priests were watching the sacrifices
[1:00:46] everybody
[1:00:47] before they offered the sacrifices and
[1:00:50] the of and the washing of the sacrifices
[1:00:53] they have to baptize the sacrifice
[1:00:56] into the world everybody here so we
[1:00:59] found out that from there came the word
[1:01:01] of baptism
[1:01:03] amen and back here
[1:01:06] now the third thing that we found about
[1:01:08] the
[1:01:09] and back here that's why you have the
[1:01:11] washing of defeat here and the sacrifice
[1:01:13] was in exodus chapter 40 where god told
[1:01:17] moses bring aaron and his son and wash
[1:01:20] them with the water ever here
[1:01:23] so when god told him
[1:01:26] about washing not the hand and the feet
[1:01:29] only but washing the priest themselves
[1:01:33] and washing the priest and the children
[1:01:36] of the priest everybody care
[1:01:39] but the problem was that when we look
[1:01:41] under this leave this priesthood here
[1:01:45] the levitical priesthood here this
[1:01:47] priesthood was not perfect
[1:01:52] hallelujah the bible said in hebrews
[1:01:55] chapter 9 verse 7 that but into the
[1:01:59] second veil
[1:02:01] when they say the second veil if you
[1:02:03] remember on sunday
[1:02:05] the tabernacle was like this this was
[1:02:07] open to the outside
[1:02:09] and the second one this was the holy
[1:02:11] place and the holiest about here
[1:02:14] the tabernacle only have two veils
[1:02:18] here
[1:02:19] when you're coming on the outside up
[1:02:21] over here you can see the sun and the
[1:02:24] moon and the star no problem
[1:02:26] once you get here you don't see the sky
[1:02:28] anymore
[1:02:29] once you get there you don't see the sky
[1:02:31] anymore back here so from here to here
[1:02:34] you have the first veil that we spoke
[1:02:37] about on sunday everybody
[1:02:40] then when you leave here before you
[1:02:42] enter the holy of holies you have the
[1:02:45] second veil
[1:02:46] this is the veil that was rent
[1:02:49] when jesus christ died on the cross
[1:02:52] ever here so now paul is referring to
[1:02:55] the second veil
[1:02:58] because what was here was a gate
[1:03:02] we understand now
[1:03:03] blessed be the name of the lord paul
[1:03:06] said into the second veil went to the
[1:03:09] high priest alone
[1:03:11] nobody only the high priest
[1:03:13] once every year not without blood
[1:03:17] which he offered for himself and for the
[1:03:20] error of the people
[1:03:23] what was this signifying
[1:03:25] paul said the holy ghost
[1:03:28] this
[1:03:28] signifying that the way into the holiest
[1:03:33] right here but here
[1:03:35] of the way into the holiest of all was
[1:03:39] not yet made manifest in other words it
[1:03:42] was not revealed yet while as the first
[1:03:45] tabernacle was yet standing in other
[1:03:48] words as long as the first levitical
[1:03:51] priesthood is still valid
[1:03:54] nobody has a right to enter the holy of
[1:03:57] holies
[1:03:58] everybody here
[1:03:59] nobody could do that paul continued he
[1:04:02] said which was a figure for the time
[1:04:05] then present
[1:04:07] can you imagine
[1:04:08] wasting your time you can handle that my
[1:04:10] brother for the time present which was
[1:04:13] the figure all this time he doesn't scan
[1:04:16] only right now
[1:04:17] [Laughter]
[1:04:20] which was the figure for the time then
[1:04:22] present in which were offered both gifts
[1:04:26] and sacrifices that could not make him
[1:04:29] that did the service water
[1:04:32] as pertaining to the water so regardless
[1:04:35] of how many things the high priest was
[1:04:38] doing here nevertheless
[1:04:40] when the worshiper leaves they still
[1:04:43] have the desire of sin
[1:04:45] in other words whatever was done under
[1:04:48] the first levitical priesthood could not
[1:04:51] purge the conscience
[1:04:53] could not purge the heart of the
[1:04:55] believer the believer come with the
[1:04:57] desire of sin and he goes back home
[1:05:00] again with the same desire of sin about
[1:05:04] here so
[1:05:06] that's why the law was a substitute
[1:05:10] america
[1:05:12] it was a temporary solution
[1:05:15] to cover the sin of the people and the
[1:05:18] law was pointing us to a better
[1:05:21] priesthood
[1:05:22] and that priesthood was supposed to take
[1:05:25] care of the conscience of the people and
[1:05:28] remit sin ever here
[1:05:31] so from there on the law was speaking
[1:05:34] about the coming of another priesthood
[1:05:38] everybody here
[1:05:40] and we saw that that priesthood that was
[1:05:42] coming was the priesthood of melchizedek
[1:05:47] back here and when we tried to get into
[1:05:50] the priesthood of melchizedek the first
[1:05:53] thing that we saw was after abraham came
[1:05:56] from the border melchizedek gave him
[1:05:59] water
[1:06:00] [Music]
[1:06:02] now we have brother one
[1:06:05] amen
[1:06:06] amen
[1:06:07] you have your three ordinances
[1:06:10] that must be
[1:06:12] must be
[1:06:13] must continue
[1:06:15] until jesus christ
[1:06:17] everybody here that's why we have
[1:06:20] communion bread and wine
[1:06:22] that's why we're still doing water
[1:06:24] baptism and that's why we have food
[1:06:27] washing
[1:06:28] those three mysteries was locked under
[1:06:30] the lever
[1:06:36] hallelujah brother branham say after the
[1:06:39] battle was over
[1:06:41] melchizedek served his victorious chad
[1:06:44] water
[1:06:45] communion think of that part of water
[1:06:51] do you hear me
[1:06:52] because right here the worshiper could
[1:06:55] not pre-purge
[1:06:56] so god could not enter human being
[1:07:01] god could not take a part of himself and
[1:07:04] import it into a human being
[1:07:07] so god gave a shadow of melchizedek
[1:07:11] which is a better priesthood and god
[1:07:14] gave that as a tap that after under this
[1:07:17] priesthood i might be able to take a
[1:07:20] part of me
[1:07:22] and put it into a human being
[1:07:24] ever clear that's why on the day of
[1:07:27] pentecost
[1:07:28] after jesus christ died and rose again
[1:07:32] and the veil of the temple was broken in
[1:07:35] two and showing that the way to the
[1:07:37] holiness was open
[1:07:39] now on the day of pentecost when the
[1:07:42] peanut of fire came down the peanut of
[1:07:45] fire divided itself
[1:07:48] into many now god begin to enter human
[1:07:52] beings
[1:07:57] why because melchizedek opened the way
[1:08:01] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:08:04] hallelujah he said now we want to see
[1:08:08] here in tap
[1:08:10] here is
[1:08:11] in view tap view
[1:08:14] they come that's why paul said the old
[1:08:15] testament was a shadow he was showing
[1:08:18] you things to come
[1:08:20] back here in view the communion after
[1:08:23] the battle he gave off water
[1:08:26] because the communion is a part of water
[1:08:29] but prague that cross could not be
[1:08:32] imported into a human being until he
[1:08:35] himself died for our sins
[1:08:38] everybody
[1:08:39] and after the struggle is over after you
[1:08:43] have done got yourself wiped out
[1:08:46] then
[1:08:47] is when you partake of water
[1:08:50] become part of water
[1:08:53] why are you part of his being
[1:08:56] because he took a fraction of himself
[1:08:59] and he put it in you
[1:09:02] everybody here
[1:09:03] have you ever seen the big magnet
[1:09:06] and a small magnet
[1:09:08] if you put a small magnet and a big
[1:09:10] magnet if you move the big magnet you
[1:09:13] will see the small one moving like this
[1:09:15] so when jesus christ come under the
[1:09:17] baptism of the holy spirit he take a
[1:09:20] fraction of himself and he put it in you
[1:09:23] so when god moves you moving
[1:09:26] when god is moving you moving
[1:09:28] when god is talking you talking
[1:09:32] about here because you become now a part
[1:09:35] of that being
[1:09:38] amen
[1:09:42] hallelujah
[1:09:43] hallelujah
[1:09:45] jacob russell night and would not turn
[1:09:48] him loose
[1:09:50] until he blessed him that's right
[1:09:52] batter for water
[1:09:54] and after the batter is over then god
[1:09:58] give you off water
[1:10:00] that is the true communion
[1:10:03] the little bread and what just
[1:10:05] represented it you should not take it
[1:10:08] unless you have wrestled it out and
[1:10:10] become part of water
[1:10:12] that's why if you don't have the holy
[1:10:14] ghost you should not be partaker of
[1:10:17] communion
[1:10:18] when you go into the lord's supper you
[1:10:22] are showing people that i have the holy
[1:10:24] ghost
[1:10:27] [Applause]
[1:10:30] did you hear me
[1:10:31] did you hear me
[1:10:33] when you go toward the baptism it's a
[1:10:36] nature of a good conscience of an odd
[1:10:39] world work you showing people that i
[1:10:42] have accepted jesus christ
[1:10:44] i am identified with his death and i am
[1:10:47] out
[1:10:49] when you go into communion and foot
[1:10:52] washing you are telling the people that
[1:10:54] i have already overcame myself by the
[1:10:58] new birth that's why i'm partaking of
[1:11:01] bread and wine
[1:11:06] everybody creates so far
[1:11:08] blessed be the name of the lord so the
[1:11:11] law as we stated on sunday
[1:11:14] was our school master
[1:11:16] we explained to you on sunday he just
[1:11:18] gave us a conscience an awareness of
[1:11:21] what sin was he was a school master to
[1:11:25] bring us unto christ
[1:11:27] why
[1:11:28] that we might be justified by water
[1:11:30] because the justifier by faith is jesus
[1:11:33] christ he is the author and the water
[1:11:36] and the finisher of your faith so the
[1:11:39] law was pulling us all the way to christ
[1:11:42] when he put you on cross and cross hand
[1:11:44] on the rest
[1:11:45] back here hey but here that's why jesus
[1:11:48] says this on john chapter 5 verse 45
[1:11:51] he says to the jews he said do not think
[1:11:55] that i will accuse you to the father
[1:12:00] everybody
[1:12:01] there is one that water
[1:12:04] accuses you even who
[1:12:07] if moses was accusing people so moses
[1:12:10] was not dead
[1:12:15] anybody here
[1:12:16] back here that's why brother branham
[1:12:18] said when he stepped on the on the rock
[1:12:21] he died and resurrected again because he
[1:12:24] is one of those two anointed and he's
[1:12:27] standing on heaven accusing the jews
[1:12:30] that this is not what i told them
[1:12:32] and so for you to accuse there you must
[1:12:35] be alive
[1:12:36] so moses was not dead
[1:12:38] ever here because of my transfiguration
[1:12:42] at the crowning of jesus christ we saw
[1:12:45] moses and elijah coming up
[1:12:48] amen amen
[1:12:52] ever here
[1:12:53] moses died
[1:12:58] and back here
[1:12:59] and rose again
[1:13:03] elijah never died
[1:13:06] ever
[1:13:08] never died but was taken into a rapture
[1:13:12] back here so one prophet
[1:13:15] shows the power of resurrection
[1:13:19] do you follow me
[1:13:20] and the other prophet shows the power of
[1:13:23] translation
[1:13:27] [Applause]
[1:13:29] you hear me
[1:13:30] so when he was time for the adoption of
[1:13:33] jesus christ because the adoption is a
[1:13:36] crowning
[1:13:38] is a crime of a ministry it is jesus
[1:13:41] christ have reached the highest point of
[1:13:44] his ministry about here he opened to
[1:13:48] power
[1:13:50] he unfolds to power
[1:13:53] he unfold the power of resurrection and
[1:13:56] the power of translation
[1:13:59] that's why after moon transfiguration
[1:14:02] jesus christ went and broke the seals
[1:14:06] [Music]
[1:14:08] is he soaking
[1:14:09] is he shocking
[1:14:10] is he shocking and when he finished he
[1:14:13] went down to hell and resurrect
[1:14:16] everybody that was there and he didn't
[1:14:18] stop about resurrecting the old
[1:14:21] testament sam but he also took them to
[1:14:24] the rapture because those two power
[1:14:26] unfolded themselves the power of
[1:14:29] resurrection and the power of rapture he
[1:14:33] comes in the mountain under a cloud
[1:14:37] [Applause]
[1:14:40] [Music]
[1:14:43] did you hear me
[1:14:45] did you hear me
[1:14:46] somebody said no
[1:14:48] let me start it again
[1:14:51] jesus could heal the seeker
[1:14:56] is it okay
[1:14:57] you hear me
[1:14:58] jesus could open the blind
[1:15:01] eyes
[1:15:02] the death could hear
[1:15:04] about here
[1:15:05] he went and resurrected lazarus
[1:15:14] but after the death
[1:15:18] the burial
[1:15:20] and the resurrection of jesus christ
[1:15:22] whoever came out from there
[1:15:25] never would die again
[1:15:30] ever here and not only did he
[1:15:33] demonstrate his power of resurrection
[1:15:36] but he also unfolded the power of the
[1:15:39] translation he took them all the way to
[1:15:43] the rapture
[1:15:46] and back here so when a ministry of the
[1:15:49] son of man start
[1:15:51] he starts with healing
[1:15:53] [Applause]
[1:15:54] [Music]
[1:15:55] [Applause]
[1:15:58] he starts with the preaching of the
[1:16:00] gospel
[1:16:01] and the healing of the people
[1:16:04] and then later on jesus begin to discern
[1:16:07] the people
[1:16:10] here after the discernment
[1:16:14] jesus will go into a mountain
[1:16:18] and in a mountain a cloud will come down
[1:16:22] and the cloud will give him power to
[1:16:24] break the seal open
[1:16:28] and after he breaks the seals open then
[1:16:31] he can preach to souls in prison
[1:16:35] but the end of that ministry
[1:16:37] will bring the resurrection of the dead
[1:16:41] and the rapture of the old testament
[1:16:43] center
[1:16:46] did i lose somebody
[1:16:49] did i lose somebody
[1:16:51] did i lose somebody
[1:16:53] do you want me to repeat one more time
[1:16:56] so somebody is lost
[1:16:58] back all up a little bit
[1:17:06] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:17:09] can i always listen
[1:17:11] we are talking about the son of man
[1:17:13] ministry
[1:17:16] the son of man ministry
[1:17:19] you need to understand god by his
[1:17:21] characteristics
[1:17:24] because god usually immorphy
[1:17:28] in other words god changes masks
[1:17:34] god can appear today like this
[1:17:37] and tomorrow he can change and appear
[1:17:39] like somebody else
[1:17:40] for you to decode that he's god you must
[1:17:44] make sure you understand his
[1:17:46] characteristics
[1:17:48] because jesus christ the same yesterday
[1:17:51] today and
[1:17:53] god doesn't change
[1:17:55] even if he changes mask but the
[1:17:58] characteristic remains the same
[1:18:01] [Music]
[1:18:03] so you must know the dealing with god
[1:18:07] do you hear me
[1:18:09] so when he came
[1:18:11] when he start his ministry
[1:18:13] you hear me his first was preaching the
[1:18:16] gospel
[1:18:18] the bible also said he was teaching the
[1:18:21] gospel
[1:18:22] for those who have a problem with
[1:18:24] teaching you see me i can load you with
[1:18:25] scripture about it because they always
[1:18:28] say preach the gospel preach of jesus
[1:18:30] say go into the whole world and teach
[1:18:33] you need that you see me and jesus also
[1:18:35] say preach
[1:18:36] so we preach and teach
[1:18:38] you cannot go preach preach preach
[1:18:40] preach preach and you don't teach you
[1:18:42] cannot go teach teach teach teach and
[1:18:44] you don't preach
[1:18:50] here
[1:18:51] preaching teaching and then he was
[1:18:53] healing the sick
[1:18:56] because the spirit of the lord is upon
[1:18:59] me
[1:18:59] he has given me water
[1:19:01] to open the prison heart to heal the
[1:19:04] brokenhearted that is the first ministry
[1:19:06] then later on we found him that as he
[1:19:09] progresses he began to discern people
[1:19:12] thought
[1:19:13] do you remember the woman at the well he
[1:19:15] looked at peter he said you are bar
[1:19:17] jonas he looked at natanya he said oh
[1:19:20] behold an israelite he said master where
[1:19:22] did you see me say when you were praying
[1:19:24] over there under the under the
[1:19:26] what
[1:19:28] the fig tree i saw you ever care
[1:19:31] healing of the sick the festival
[1:19:36] you okay now
[1:19:37] discernment of the spirit to the second
[1:19:39] poll
[1:19:42] [Music]
[1:19:45] now we okay
[1:19:46] now we okay
[1:19:47] then after a certain level of ministry
[1:19:52] remember over here
[1:19:54] the pillar of fire came down
[1:19:57] and said this is my beloved son in whom
[1:20:00] i am well pleased
[1:20:04] and dwell on him and the pillar of fire
[1:20:06] begin to maneuver this
[1:20:08] the
[1:20:10] the cadillac
[1:20:13] by healing the sick
[1:20:15] i'm not saying jesus cadillac but if you
[1:20:17] start with me you understand what i'm
[1:20:19] saying
[1:20:20] about here
[1:20:21] healing the sick then he shifted he
[1:20:23] changed the shift he goes to two and
[1:20:25] then he move on
[1:20:27] and he open up again
[1:20:29] and back here
[1:20:31] and the horsepower will open up again
[1:20:33] that's when you hear
[1:20:33] [Music]
[1:20:34] it keep moving
[1:20:37] back here then from there on jesus move
[1:20:40] to a certain level
[1:20:42] in his ministry and deliver require him
[1:20:46] to go to the mountain
[1:20:52] everybody here
[1:20:53] for whoever was lost you need to listen
[1:20:56] carefully
[1:20:57] when he went to that mountain a cloud
[1:20:59] meeting
[1:21:02] ever here
[1:21:04] in the cloud
[1:21:06] in that cloud came moses
[1:21:08] and elijah
[1:21:10] the power of resurrection
[1:21:13] that will resurrect the descent
[1:21:16] that are already dead
[1:21:18] and the power of the rapture that will
[1:21:20] take those sent into the presence of god
[1:21:24] and back here
[1:21:25] it is called the crowning of the
[1:21:28] ministry or his adoption
[1:21:32] ever here over here this is my beloved
[1:21:36] son in whom i am well
[1:21:38] but over here this is my beloved son do
[1:21:42] what
[1:21:44] he hear him
[1:21:45] in other words he become the man of
[1:21:47] peace
[1:21:48] whatever he says it's already agreed
[1:21:51] [Applause]
[1:21:52] [Music]
[1:21:54] ever here and brother branham shows that
[1:21:57] when he came down from there
[1:22:00] that ministry didn't last too long
[1:22:03] hey mark here brother bottom saying when
[1:22:06] he came down in matthew 24 he opened the
[1:22:09] seals
[1:22:10] we already demonstrated that to you when
[1:22:12] we were over there ever here
[1:22:15] if you go to matthew 24 you will see all
[1:22:17] the seals
[1:22:18] when he reached the seventh seal because
[1:22:21] the seven seal is silenced when they ask
[1:22:23] him when is the time of your coming he
[1:22:25] said no i don't know about it because he
[1:22:27] must keep quiet
[1:22:29] ever clear so far
[1:22:31] everybody cares so far
[1:22:33] ever clear so far and at the end this is
[1:22:36] called the third pool ministry of christ
[1:22:40] this ministry when he finished
[1:22:44] it will bring the people that died
[1:22:47] before
[1:22:49] everybody that died from adam all the
[1:22:52] way to jesus christ
[1:22:54] this ministry will pull them from the
[1:22:56] grave
[1:22:57] you hear me
[1:22:58] change their body
[1:23:00] and take them to the rapture
[1:23:04] [Music]
[1:23:06] are we okay
[1:23:07] it is the ministry of adoption of the
[1:23:10] crowning ministry
[1:23:13] and then that finishes the dispersation
[1:23:16] of the old testament
[1:23:18] now the new testament opened up
[1:23:20] with a new priesthood which is the
[1:23:23] priesthood of melchizedek
[1:23:26] now paul died
[1:23:31] peter died the disciple died
[1:23:34] mountain died columba died arenas died
[1:23:39] luther died wesley died we need
[1:23:43] something that's gonna resurrect those
[1:23:45] people
[1:23:46] and take those people to the rapture
[1:23:49] [Applause]
[1:23:56] everybody clear so far that's why that
[1:23:59] same ministry must come back again

[1:24:08] of people
[1:24:09] we got the jews
[1:24:11] we got the samaritan and we got the
[1:24:13] gentile he did the discernment for the
[1:24:16] jews
[1:24:18] he did the discernment for the samaritan
[1:24:20] but there was another group that was
[1:24:22] left which were the gentiles
[1:24:25] that discernment was kept for the second
[1:24:28] coming
[1:24:29] this was the first coming
[1:24:31] he needed to come on the second coming
[1:24:34] and on the second coming we saw somebody
[1:24:37] baptizing
[1:24:43] hey people here and the pillar of fire
[1:24:46] came down
[1:24:47] and said as john the baptist
[1:24:50] was a foreigner of your first coming
[1:24:53] your message will be the foreign of the
[1:24:56] second water
[1:24:58] and then we saw him begin to preach
[1:25:01] and to have him in campaign
[1:25:04] all over the world and after a while he
[1:25:07] began to discern them
[1:25:17] let me help you up
[1:25:19] normally the one who was supposed to do
[1:25:22] that
[1:25:23] is jesus christ himself
[1:25:26] do you hear me
[1:25:27] you hear me but if jesus comes back the
[1:25:30] rapture must take place
[1:25:33] so we need to keep the body of jesus
[1:25:35] christ over there
[1:25:37] but god needs to borrow somebody's body
[1:25:41] anybody care about here
[1:25:44] but god could not enter the people under
[1:25:47] the levitical priesthood
[1:25:49] he took the melchizedek priesthood to
[1:25:52] give god permission
[1:25:55] he can enter human being
[1:25:57] [Applause]
[1:26:01] do you hear me
[1:26:03] you hear me
[1:26:04] that's why you saw brother branham
[1:26:06] turning the
[1:26:09] [Applause]
[1:26:19] that was his second pull but brother
[1:26:22] brother must go to a mountain like jesus
[1:26:28] everybody here brother branham must go
[1:26:31] to his adoption ministry
[1:26:34] everybody here that's why you heard
[1:26:36] brother branham say what happened in
[1:26:39] sunset
[1:26:41] because the sunrise is on the east
[1:26:45] that was jesus christ the sun rises on
[1:26:48] the east but the sunset is on the west
[1:26:52] so jesus already did that and somebody
[1:26:56] named that mountain sunset mountain
[1:26:59] in the coronado forester
[1:27:03] coronado in spanish means
[1:27:08] [Applause]
[1:27:16] quran why did somebody call that the
[1:27:19] coronado
[1:27:21] coronado means the crowning
[1:27:24] ever here
[1:27:26] ever here so we knew that it is the
[1:27:29] crowning of brother branham ministry and
[1:27:32] when brother branham finished there he
[1:27:34] came back he preached the seals

[1:34:23] when he put the slide he took a lot of
[1:34:24] time he need more time probably to do it
[1:34:26] [Music]
[1:34:31] let me go back here do not think that i
[1:34:33] will accuse you to the father there is
[1:34:35] one that accuses you even who
[1:34:38] in whom you trust
[1:34:40] for
[1:34:41] had he believed who
[1:34:44] he would have believed water
[1:34:46] [Music]
[1:34:49] moses came to prepare you to receive me
[1:34:52] you missed the revelation of moses you

[1:35:01] coming sin kill a lamb go come don't
[1:35:04] even understand god is talking god stop
[1:35:07] god and by missing the revelation
[1:35:10] you misguided
[1:35:12] that's what happened in the message of
[1:35:14] the hour
[1:35:15] [Applause]
[1:35:17] the people thought it's another religion
[1:35:21] it's another book of god
[1:35:24] it is a life
[1:35:26] it is the living god
[1:35:28] the message is christ
[1:35:31] [Applause]
[1:35:38] hallelujah
[1:35:40] let's look at mercy merchandise
[1:35:42] who is this melchizedek
[1:35:45] my god
[1:35:47] blessed be the name of the lord for this
[1:35:49] melchizedek
[1:35:51] king of salem priest of the most high
[1:35:53] god who met abraham returning from the
[1:35:57] slaughter of the king and blessed him
[1:35:59] [Music]
[1:36:01] why did he meet abraham we saw that on
[1:36:03] sunday
[1:36:04] the bible says know ye therefore
[1:36:07] that day which are of what the same are
[1:36:11] the children of abraham
[1:36:13] so now it's no more the jews
[1:36:16] because you might be a jews but you
[1:36:18] don't have faith you're not a son of
[1:36:20] abraham
[1:36:24] and the scripture remember the rich
[1:36:26] young hula
[1:36:27] he was a jew
[1:36:29] he called abraham father abraham
[1:36:32] everybody
[1:36:33] but if abraham was his father why was
[1:36:35] abraham on the other side of him on the
[1:36:37] other side
[1:36:38] that's why jesus tell them your father
[1:36:40] is the devil
[1:36:41] that's why the difference is there you
[1:36:44] jew by this
[1:36:45] but the true jew is a jew here
[1:36:48] [Music]
[1:36:49] [Applause]
[1:36:49] [Music]
[1:36:51] amen
[1:36:52] and the scripture brother michael for
[1:36:55] seeing
[1:36:56] in other words the truth that there's
[1:36:58] scripture already seen there that we see
[1:37:01] where we're heading anybody here
[1:37:03] foreseeing that god will justify the
[1:37:06] hidden not the jerusalem
[1:37:09] through water
[1:37:10] preached before the gospel unto abraham
[1:37:14] saying in this shall water
[1:37:19] i thought he was only israel
[1:37:21] all nation be blessed
[1:37:24] so mercy zedek going through everywhere
[1:37:27] must find somebody who have the promise
[1:37:30] to attain everybody
[1:37:33] let me explain it again
[1:37:36] do you hear me
[1:37:38] melchizedek wanted to bless everybody
[1:37:42] because his children are scattered
[1:37:45] but the law
[1:37:48] restricted everything to the jew
[1:37:50] ever here so before the jewish nation
[1:37:54] start
[1:37:55] because the jewish nation start by jacob
[1:37:58] god moved quickly to abraham because
[1:38:01] abraham was not a jew
[1:38:02] ever here and when god checked abraham
[1:38:06] he saw in abraham
[1:38:08] predestinated pipes
[1:38:12] a system
[1:38:13] that can reach every nation
[1:38:17] because if he would have taken that
[1:38:19] promise and give it to moses under the
[1:38:22] law
[1:38:23] the jews only are saved
[1:38:25] he said if i put it to this channel it's
[1:38:27] only one way
[1:38:29] i need a highway with exit
[1:38:32] so the 85 was abraham
[1:38:36] so when he reached abraham he said this
[1:38:38] is the channel i need so he took that
[1:38:40] promise and loaded in abraham so that
[1:38:44] when we are approaching abraham nobody
[1:38:47] can claim him
[1:38:48] because abraham was another worshiper
[1:38:50] [Applause]
[1:38:55] amen
[1:38:56] here if you go to a jew he would say
[1:38:58] jehovah
[1:39:01] did abraham have the law
[1:39:03] abraham will have nothing to do with the
[1:39:05] law
[1:39:06] so god give it outside of the law
[1:39:08] outside of the border
[1:39:10] [Music]
[1:39:14] the mystery of the level
[1:39:17] indeed shall all nations be blessed
[1:39:20] so then they which be of faith
[1:39:23] are blessed with them
[1:39:26] and now to abraham and his what
[1:39:30] when we say seed we thought he was isaac
[1:39:34] here we thought he was isaac but god
[1:39:37] showed that he was not isaac
[1:39:39] do you know how god did it
[1:39:41] he said abraham you have a son
[1:39:45] your only begotten son
[1:39:47] while abraham had two sons
[1:39:50] [Music]
[1:39:52] are you sleeping
[1:39:54] [Music]
[1:39:56] abraham had the first son called ishmael
[1:40:00] everybody
[1:40:02] but ishmael was not born of abraham
[1:40:06] ishmael was the son of abram
[1:40:10] [Applause]
[1:40:17] you want to go home
[1:40:19] you want to go home
[1:40:23] mother
[1:40:25] robert kelly you heard them
[1:40:27] he himself said preach
[1:40:30] about here
[1:40:33] abram
[1:40:36] was the father of ishmael
[1:40:39] but abraham
[1:40:43] with h.a.m
[1:40:44] [Applause]
[1:40:46] but here
[1:40:47] was the father of isaac
[1:40:50] that's why god said your only begotten
[1:40:53] son
[1:40:54] because i'm talking to abraham not
[1:40:57] abraham
[1:40:58] i already changed him
[1:41:00] he's now abraham
[1:41:02] [Applause]
[1:41:05] he said abraham
[1:41:07] get your only begotten son
[1:41:09] they say praise the lord the jews say we
[1:41:12] got it
[1:41:13] you see he picked isaac so the whole
[1:41:15] promise is in isaac
[1:41:17] so since we are the seed of isaac isaac
[1:41:20] we got jacob jacob begat liver we got
[1:41:22] joseph we got this this this so we have
[1:41:24] claim on isaac he said i'm going to make
[1:41:27] a sacrifice
[1:41:28] say yes who isaac
[1:41:30] the jews over there in heaven they say
[1:41:32] praise the lord they begin to dance
[1:41:34] my name is in the book my name is
[1:41:37] god say don't worry the peak who isaac
[1:41:40] take isaac
[1:41:41] go with him his mother this boy is too
[1:41:44] close to his mama let mama sleep how's
[1:41:47] it coming
[1:41:48] get in it where are we going
[1:41:50] you ask too much question let's get it
[1:41:55] so maybe sarah thought they're going to
[1:41:56] walmart to pick up some groceries
[1:42:01] [Music]
[1:42:03] ever here
[1:42:04] he picked up isaac and went with isaac
[1:42:08] isaac very obedient do this yes father
[1:42:12] do this yes father he took the altar do
[1:42:14] you follow me and put isaac on the altar
[1:42:18] and when he put us across the altar the
[1:42:20] jews in heaven they begin to shout they
[1:42:23] say go go daddy go daddy
[1:42:26] abraham pull the sword quickly
[1:42:28] the jew said go ahead anoint him so he
[1:42:31] can do it whenever i want to do this god
[1:42:34] says stop
[1:42:35] [Music]
[1:42:39] the seed is not as it
[1:42:41] [Music]
[1:42:42] [Applause]
[1:42:45] did you hear me
[1:42:46] the seed cannot be jew
[1:42:53] he cannot be a gentile
[1:42:55] it cannot be a samaritan
[1:42:58] so it's a seed that i must create
[1:43:02] therefore
[1:43:04] let me create a rhema
[1:43:06] if you notice that remember the ram that
[1:43:10] was created didn't have a father or a
[1:43:12] mother
[1:43:17] [Applause]
[1:43:18] [Music]
[1:43:19] [Applause]
[1:43:29] at the opening of the seventh seal the
[1:43:32] bible become a new
[1:43:36] [Applause]
[1:43:39] hallelujah
[1:43:40] hallelujah
[1:43:42] did you see that
[1:43:44] with that father with that mother he
[1:43:46] created the rhyme
[1:43:48] he said that's the ramp that you killed
[1:43:52] not isaac
[1:43:57] so god still showing that the seed will
[1:44:00] be a rhema
[1:44:02] a realm with horner
[1:44:05] and if you notice they called him by the
[1:44:07] horn
[1:44:08] because horns meets power
[1:44:10] they have to block his power
[1:44:13] to kill him
[1:44:14] because if his power is open
[1:44:17] he can call a legion of angel to deliver
[1:44:19] him
[1:44:21] so my father my father why have they
[1:44:24] forsaken me they gotta block his horn
[1:44:27] they gotta block his power
[1:44:30] to kill him
[1:44:31] because you cannot kill god
[1:44:34] [Applause]
[1:44:38] [Music]
[1:44:38] [Applause]
[1:44:41] i don't know where i am now
[1:44:43] hallelujah so to abraham and his what
[1:44:47] where the promise is what
[1:44:50] and he says not to seeds
[1:44:54] house of water because the jews we
[1:44:57] gathered
[1:44:58] i can see the jew in heaven
[1:45:01] and then we the gentile rose and say
[1:45:05] [Applause]
[1:45:09] ever here ever here but as of what
[1:45:13] and that seed which is who
[1:45:19] hey so far
[1:45:20] why because in acts chapter 3 verse 25
[1:45:24] the bible say ye are the children of the
[1:45:27] promise of the prophet this is peter
[1:45:30] coming up coming out of the day of
[1:45:32] pentecost
[1:45:33] he tells the jews he say you you are the
[1:45:35] children of the prophet ever here and of
[1:45:38] the covenant which god made with our
[1:45:43] saying unto abraham and in that seed
[1:45:46] shall all the kindred of help of the
[1:45:48] earth be water
[1:45:51] but that promise was for everybody the
[1:45:54] jews took it and the hook it to the
[1:45:57] anybody care
[1:45:59] and when peter say unto you what
[1:46:02] so first that's why jesus says salvation
[1:46:05] is of the
[1:46:06] you understand it was first given to
[1:46:08] them like get it
[1:46:10] back
[1:46:11] unto you first god having raised up his
[1:46:15] son jesus sent him to do what
[1:46:19] in turning away every one of you from
[1:46:21] his water
[1:46:22] because the worshiper could not be
[1:46:24] purging conscience
[1:46:26] so they sent jesus to give them the
[1:46:30] melchizedek priesthood
[1:46:32] ever care so far
[1:46:34] now when jesus came
[1:46:37] the jew rejected him
[1:46:40] watch god
[1:46:43] when the jew rejected him
[1:46:45] automatically god should go back to the
[1:46:48] gentile
[1:46:49] but god lingered again
[1:46:52] to see if he can
[1:46:54] negotiate with the jews
[1:46:57] to at least get them out of work even
[1:47:00] though they rejected him they say let
[1:47:02] his blood be upon us
[1:47:04] normally god should have turned around
[1:47:06] and just go but god stop again
[1:47:09] and he said let me try something
[1:47:13] let me pick paul
[1:47:14] anybody here
[1:47:15] when god picked paul paul has three
[1:47:18] pipes
[1:47:23] you okay
[1:47:26] at nine
[1:47:28] but the lord said unto him
[1:47:30] go that way for he is a
[1:47:34] that's paul
[1:47:35] unto me to bear my name before the
[1:47:39] first pipe and the
[1:47:42] second pop and there
[1:47:44] so that pipe was still there
[1:47:47] everybody
[1:47:48] but the jews clogged their pipe from
[1:47:51] paul
[1:47:57] so paul
[1:47:59] had three pipes
[1:48:01] a park here
[1:48:02] three pipes we have the gentile
[1:48:05] we have the king you saw him before king
[1:48:07] agrippa he have to compare before caesar
[1:48:11] remember that
[1:48:12] all those pipes were open
[1:48:14] that's why he talked to king agrippa and
[1:48:16] king
[1:48:18] you almost
[1:48:20] he didn't understand the pipe was open
[1:48:27] you hear me
[1:48:29] and then the jews
[1:48:31] let's see what the jews after they
[1:48:33] rejected jesus christ still god left
[1:48:36] them a little something like that
[1:48:39] try together get together here
[1:48:44] here
[1:48:45] at 26 15
[1:48:47] and i said who are that this is paul
[1:48:50] explaining
[1:48:51] his experience lord and he say i am
[1:48:54] jesus whom they are persecuted
[1:48:56] but rise and stand up on their feet for
[1:48:59] i have appeared unto thee for this
[1:49:01] purpose to make thee a minister
[1:49:05] and a witness
[1:49:07] both of these things which that has seen
[1:49:09] and of those things in which i will
[1:49:12] appear unto thee
[1:49:14] delivering deed from the people and from
[1:49:17] the gentile unto whom now i do what
[1:49:22] so paul god is telling you him
[1:49:25] i'm sending you here
[1:49:26] now everybody
[1:49:29] so paul should stay
[1:49:31] no more jews forget about it listen
[1:49:34] to open their eyes
[1:49:37] and to turn them the gentile from
[1:49:39] darkness to water
[1:49:41] and from the power of satan unto who
[1:49:44] that they may receive water
[1:49:47] forgiveness of sin and an inheritance we
[1:49:51] didn't have that before
[1:49:53] but melchizedek
[1:49:55] open it up an inheritance among them
[1:49:58] which are sanctified by faith that is in
[1:50:02] that's why paul said the faith the life
[1:50:05] that i live now i live it by the faith
[1:50:07] of the son of god
[1:50:10] hey back here
[1:50:11] let's see what paul does
[1:50:13] in acts 13 the bible says but when the
[1:50:17] jews saw the multitude
[1:50:19] they were filled with envy
[1:50:21] they were filled with envy against jesus
[1:50:23] christ because the multitude were coming
[1:50:26] to jesus christ instead of receiving
[1:50:28] jesus christ jealousy god that's why
[1:50:31] peter our whole pilot understood that
[1:50:33] they they destroyed jesus by envy
[1:50:37] so when paul began to preach they found
[1:50:39] out that a lot of people are coming to
[1:50:41] power and the jews now were filled with
[1:50:44] envy and speak against those things
[1:50:47] which were spoken by who
[1:50:49] they attacked the message of paul
[1:50:57] you okay
[1:50:58] is everybody awake
[1:50:59] and then contradicting and doing
[1:51:01] whatever
[1:51:03] is it you no
[1:51:05] is he new
[1:51:08] okay
[1:51:09] then paul and barnabas what's bold and
[1:51:12] say he was what
[1:51:15] that
[1:51:17] should water
[1:51:21] you see the pipe
[1:51:23] you see that pipe
[1:51:24] you see the pipe
[1:51:26] but seeing you put it from you
[1:51:30] after rejecting christ you're still
[1:51:32] rejecting again this
[1:51:34] back here and judge yourself unworthy
[1:51:39] of eternal life
[1:51:41] lord return to the water
[1:51:45] do you see that
[1:51:47] do you see that
[1:51:49] four so has the lord commanded us saying
[1:51:53] i have set thee to be a light of them
[1:51:57] that that should be for salvation until
[1:52:00] the end of the
[1:52:01] remember beginning in jerusalem samaria
[1:52:04] and onto
[1:52:06] melchizedek and when the gentile not the
[1:52:09] jew heard this they were water
[1:52:13] and glorified the word of the lord and
[1:52:16] as many as were ordained predestination
[1:52:20] to eternal life did what
[1:52:22] [Music]
[1:52:26] ever here
[1:52:28] everybody here

[1:52:48] from macedonia paul was what
[1:52:52] who was pressing paul in the spirit
[1:52:56] ever
[1:52:58] the jews rejected him the first time i
[1:53:00] showed you they rejected him the second
[1:53:03] time still the holy spirit is pushing
[1:53:06] this channel
[1:53:09] you see
[1:53:10] do you see
[1:53:11] and paul was pressed in the spirit and
[1:53:15] testified to him
[1:53:17] that jesus was what
[1:53:19] and watch the
[1:53:21] watch again what they do and when they
[1:53:23] oppose themselves and did what
[1:53:26] he shook off his remnant and say unto
[1:53:28] them your blood be upon your head i am
[1:53:32] clean from his fault i will go unto
[1:53:36] death
[1:53:40] do you see
[1:53:41] how the jews were clogging the pipe
[1:53:44] take act 28

[1:54:26] and when we came to rome the centurion
[1:54:29] delivered the prisoner to the captain of
[1:54:31] god
[1:54:32] but paul was not allowed to dwell by
[1:54:35] himself with a soldier that kept him
[1:54:39] they took paul to roma
[1:54:41] and he came to pass that after three
[1:54:43] days
[1:54:44] paul called who
[1:54:47] do you hear it
[1:54:49] paul called the chief of the jews
[1:54:51] together
[1:54:53] for the last time
[1:54:54] this man is pushing the door again
[1:54:56] remember the emergency bullet

[1:55:01] it's not working he keep shooting they
[1:55:03] can't get it anybody clear
[1:55:06] and paul called the chief priest of the
[1:55:08] jews together and when they were come
[1:55:10] together he said unto them he said to
[1:55:13] them man
[1:55:14] and brethren
[1:55:15] though i have committed nothing against
[1:55:18] the people
[1:55:19] or custom of our fathers because he's
[1:55:21] talking to the jew yet was a delivered
[1:55:23] prisoner from jerusalem into the hands
[1:55:26] of the roman
[1:55:27] that's why i'm here in roma
[1:55:29] who when they have examined me the roman
[1:55:32] would have let me go because there was
[1:55:35] no cause of death in me
[1:55:37] but when the jews spoke against it
[1:55:40] i was constrained in other words i was
[1:55:42] forced
[1:55:43] to appeal to caesar so paul saw that
[1:55:46] there is no way out he just caught i
[1:55:48] appealed to caesar they said since you
[1:55:49] spoke peace caesar you got to go to rome
[1:55:52] i appealed to caesar not that i have
[1:55:55] anything to accuse my nation of in other
[1:55:57] words i didn't appeal to caesar so that
[1:56:00] i'm gonna accuse the jews no i appealed
[1:56:02] to caesar to escape
[1:56:04] because these guys don't understand
[1:56:06] verse 20 for this cause therefore have i
[1:56:09] called for you to see you i call you the
[1:56:12] jews to see you and to speak with you

[1:56:22] time the apostle is banging the door
[1:56:24] anybody clear
[1:56:26] and they said to him we need to receive
[1:56:29] a letter out of judea concerning you

[1:59:00] how it is we are not a cult
[1:59:03] [Music]
[1:59:03] [Applause]
[1:59:05] we are not a bunch of fanatics
[1:59:08] we are servants of god
[1:59:11] that has been called by the holy ghost
[1:59:14] you shall have all kind of name talk to

[2:00:31] because if you don't call himself so he
[2:00:34] didn't preach like paul
[2:00:36] so you must make his ministry
[2:00:39] vindicated
[2:00:41] [Applause]
[2:00:46] the ministry of jesus christ goes within
[2:00:49] salt
[2:00:50] and blasphemy and if that same ministry
[2:00:53] came back he doesn't bring the good only
[2:00:57] he bring also the bad

[2:01:48] [Applause]

[2:02:40] what you think for us concerning this
[2:02:43] sect
[2:02:44] jesus we know that everywhere it is
[2:02:46] spoken against oh you know that message
[2:02:49] we already heard about it
[2:02:50] [Music]
[2:02:54] and when they had appointed him a day
[2:02:57] they came many to him into his lodging
[2:03:00] many of the jews let's go
[2:03:03] remember the last pipe
[2:03:06] he's pushing the last one
[2:03:08] many to him to his lodging to whom he
[2:03:12] expanded
[2:03:13] and testified the water
[2:03:15] the kingdom of god persuading them
[2:03:18] concerning who
[2:03:20] buff out of the water
[2:03:23] look where he's pulling jesus christ
[2:03:26] because moses was bringing us to christ
[2:03:29] so he began to show them that brethren
[2:03:31] you missed the revelation
[2:03:33] the moses was talking about him
[2:03:36] here
[2:03:37] both out of the law of moses and out of
[2:03:40] the water
[2:03:41] he took even in in another word paul sat
[2:03:44] and begin by moses and pete and paul
[2:03:46] christ and took ezekiel and pulled crown
[2:03:48] and took jeremiah and putra and
[2:03:51] and we imagine that wow they're gonna
[2:03:53] receive it
[2:03:55] here and out of the prophet from water
[2:03:59] until what
[2:04:02] [Music]
[2:04:05] give them coat after coat after coat
[2:04:07] after coat after coat after scripture
[2:04:09] after scripture they still don't believe
[2:04:11] [Music]
[2:04:14] and some believe
[2:04:16] the things which were spoken and some
[2:04:19] water
[2:04:21] and when they agreed not among
[2:04:23] themselves
[2:04:24] they departed after that paul had spoken
[2:04:28] one word
[2:04:29] well
[2:04:30] so when they begin to go
[2:04:32] paul opened his mouth and begin to say
[2:04:34] something
[2:04:35] watch what paul says
[2:04:37] and we're going to head to the airport
[2:04:38] watch it
[2:04:40] paul say well spoke
[2:04:42] the holy ghost by who
[2:04:45] isaiah the prophet to our father
[2:04:48] saying
[2:04:49] go to these people
[2:04:51] and say
[2:04:52] hearing you shall hear and shall not
[2:04:56] and seeing you shasi and shanatan
[2:05:00] for the heart of these people is wax
[2:05:02] water
[2:05:03] stop a little bit who was talking those
[2:05:05] things
[2:05:07] [Music]
[2:05:08] isaiah spoke about it but somebody else
[2:05:10] was speaking about this was calling the
[2:05:12] same scripture do you know his name
[2:05:17] before paul there was somebody when he
[2:05:20] saw the jews he said this is the way
[2:05:22] isaiah spoke about you
[2:05:24] aha
[2:05:26] aha
[2:05:27] paul begin to repeat the word of jesus
[2:05:33] the scripture jesus used on the jews to
[2:05:36] show them that they were blinded paul
[2:05:38] under the anointing of the holy spirit
[2:05:41] begin to rehearse the same thing now
[2:05:44] in other words they are clogging they
[2:05:47] are detaching cutting this pipe
[2:05:51] here
[2:05:52] for their heart verse 27 of these people
[2:05:55] is wax gross and their ears are dull of
[2:05:58] hearing and their eyes have their
[2:06:00] clothes lest they should see with their
[2:06:02] eyes remember jesus spoke about it and
[2:06:05] heal with their ears and understand with
[2:06:07] their heart and should be converted and
[2:06:09] that should heal them exactly what jesus
[2:06:12] spoke
[2:06:13] watch verse 28 why paul why did paul
[2:06:15] speak like jesus
[2:06:18] amen
[2:06:20] the bible say brother branham say
[2:06:22] paul the angel of the church of ephesus
[2:06:25] paul funding this church being the
[2:06:28] messenger to it remember paul funding
[2:06:30] the church at ephesus became the
[2:06:33] messenger of that church and the spirit
[2:06:35] was in the land that time was ah
[2:06:39] and the lion is the lion of the tribe of
[2:06:42] judah which is who and christ is the
[2:06:46] paul with the word of that age
[2:06:50] did you get it
[2:06:51] in the first age was a lion age remember
[2:06:55] the four caribbeans
[2:06:56] that was the lion of the tribe of judah
[2:06:59] christ his own influence of life taking
[2:07:04] water
[2:07:05] so the influence of the ministry of
[2:07:08] jesus christ went on top of paul
[2:07:11] because jesus is trying to get the jews
[2:07:14] so when the jews rejected he repeat the
[2:07:17] same thing jesus spoke by closing the
[2:07:20] door
[2:07:22] watch verse 28
[2:07:24] be known therefore to you
[2:07:26] that the salvation of who
[2:07:30] is sent to the
[2:07:32] and that they will do what
[2:07:35] what authority have paul
[2:07:38] to close a door to a to a to a nation
[2:07:45] that's why
[2:07:47] after that you go to roman nine
[2:07:50] paul says
[2:07:52] i could wish that myself were a curse
[2:07:56] from christ for my
[2:07:59] now paul begin to sorrow he said i have
[2:08:02] sorrow continually for israel because
[2:08:05] paul understood that they are done
[2:08:08] now tattoos is coming to kill them all
[2:08:12] right but here
[2:08:13] he said i wish that myself were a curse
[2:08:17] the pastor of the age
[2:08:19] he's still longing
[2:08:21] they left the church but his heart is
[2:08:23] still sorrowful
[2:08:25] a pastor's amen
[2:08:27] where a curse from christ for my
[2:08:29] brethren my kinsmen according to the
[2:08:31] flesh
[2:08:32] paul says
[2:08:34] i'm still sorrowful for them
[2:08:37] why are you sorrowful like that paul
[2:08:40] look what paul was looking at that the
[2:08:42] jews missed
[2:08:43] who are israelites
[2:08:46] to whom pretend the water
[2:08:49] benefit of melchizedek and the water
[2:08:53] benefit of melchizedek and the water
[2:08:56] benefit of melchizedek and the water
[2:08:59] the hope toward melchizedek and the
[2:09:01] water
[2:09:03] become servant of god and water
[2:09:06] who's out there
[2:09:08] of whom us concerning the flesh who
[2:09:11] in other words my brethren miss this
[2:09:13] whole package
[2:09:17] everybody here
[2:09:18] who is christ who is overall what
[2:09:22] deity bless for
[2:09:25] amen
[2:09:26] not as though the word of god has taken
[2:09:28] non-effect it doesn't mean that god
[2:09:30] failed
[2:09:31] for they are not all water
[2:09:34] which are off
[2:09:36] now you understand not everybody is the
[2:09:38] seed of abraham neither because they are
[2:09:41] the seed of abraham by birth are they
[2:09:44] all what but in isaac
[2:09:48] you remember that sid who was who
[2:09:52] because that is there which are the
[2:09:55] children of the flesh the jews these are
[2:09:58] not
[2:10:02] the children of god
[2:10:04] but the children of the water
[2:10:07] the promise of christ are content for
[2:10:09] the water
[2:10:10] one seed because we are all in christ
[2:10:14] everybody
[2:10:15] that's why paul changes now the gear
[2:10:18] watch paul for this course i paul
[2:10:22] the prisoner of water
[2:10:24] for you the jews
[2:10:28] [Applause]
[2:10:31] now me paul
[2:10:33] i became prisoner today
[2:10:36] they block these pipes
[2:10:38] i'm only locked to one
[2:10:41] hey mark here
[2:10:43] oh prisoner of jesus christ for you who
[2:10:46] if ye have heard of the dispersation of
[2:10:50] the what
[2:10:52] so paul will receive an outpouring of
[2:10:55] grace
[2:10:56] that's why he was trying to open the
[2:10:58] jewish door to bring grace to the jews
[2:11:01] they could not understand
[2:11:03] the jews clogged the pipe so paul turn
[2:11:06] and say i don't have anything there is
[2:11:08] only one highway remaining
[2:11:11] i'm going to channel the whole grace
[2:11:13] toward the gentiles
[2:11:16] if you have heard of the dispensation of
[2:11:18] the grace of god which is given to
[2:11:23] that's who
[2:11:24] that's right
[2:11:25] because originally god told him go to
[2:11:27] the gentleman
[2:11:29] here
[2:11:30] how that by revelation he made known
[2:11:34] unto me the water
[2:11:36] as i wrote a four in you and few words
[2:11:39] before whereby when you read you may
[2:11:42] understand my knowledge in the mystery
[2:11:45] of what
[2:11:47] everybody
[2:11:48] which in other ages
[2:11:51] was not water
[2:11:53] unto the son of man as it is now
[2:11:57] unto his holy approacher and water
[2:12:01] by the water
[2:12:02] what is the mystery paul that there
[2:12:06] should be water
[2:12:08] and of the same
[2:12:10] and water
[2:12:11] of water
[2:12:13] in christ

[2:12:20] so when you're reading my writing you
[2:12:22] can discern the revelation i'm bringing
[2:12:25] and that revelation was not given before
[2:12:29] but now it's open

[2:12:34] riches of christ
[2:12:35] that you to whom i'm writing
[2:12:38] to whom god is unfolding all these
[2:12:41] revelations now
[2:12:43] you might understand that these things
[2:12:46] were not given before
[2:12:49] these things were hidden brother kelly
[2:12:52] until the split happened
[2:12:54] so you will understand
