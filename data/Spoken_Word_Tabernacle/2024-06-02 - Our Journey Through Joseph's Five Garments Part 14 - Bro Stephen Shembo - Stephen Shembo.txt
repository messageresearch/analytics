that we pray we say [Music] amen amen God bless you Saints I just want to give this testimony for the glory of God um it's actually a continuing um testimony um I know um it's been I think almost eight months maybe a little bit longer since I got my new job at um uh Mattress Firm and um then I the house meeting gave a testimony that um I received um the opportunity to become a manager at my store after only being there for six months um really the reason for this testimony is not to brag on what has happened with anything am I doing but just what God has done for me and how amazing he is and how the word is very much on point um I know Pastor been talking about a lot of different subjects he was talking about discipline he was talking about you know um having our faith in God and really having a spoken word and after being under such a a anointing a Ministry you could see how he you know definitely will show you not only in the spiritual when we're here together but outside of here at your job and in other places so um to make it quick and short um I took the position I had no idea what I was going to when I got the job I um basically got my own store when I got the store the store was a mess a mess meaning a way it's presentable how it looked um I don't want to go into details but it just wasn't you know a very very good one it was also on the bottom of the list in our region or sorry in our district so in within two months um no sorry within a month and a half um again nothing of myself God allowed me to go into that store and take it from the bottom bottom of the rankings to the number two in the region then additionally not only that and I honestly have no words to tell you how it happened I understand there's a spirit that comes with Christians you know but people can sense it we don't even know it I don't know if I attracted the people it was very weird because nobody would come to that store I also somehow CU I didn't see the money but but somehow the um the uh I was ranked number one in the region so not the district but the region as well I I looked at the the chart three weeks in a row and I just couldn't understand so I want to give glory to God for that because it showed that you know um someone can come in and and it's never been done before by the way so I just want to give glory to God for that but mainly going into the last part of the testimony I'm keep trying to keep it short um um at near the end um our district manager who was the new district manager when I got the position she's the one who offered me the job she ended up quitting for a certain reason when she quit it's like the whole company came on me because we had an agreement that I would be able to work basically what we I'll use the terminology someone use a special schedule so that I could attend church and run my business well when the is she left they said um excuse me ma'am no and I said okay then well I will be stepping down because I wasn't going to um miss out on standing on about the word of God and being in the house of God and I know you guys probably noticed with this whole month that I wasn't in church I was very very not happy about that but I said I'll stick it through with the word of God being talking about discipline and and run my way through the course but I said no as soon give me a date and then I'll step down so as of last Tuesday I've stepped down and I'm very happy with my decision that doesn't change anything too much there was a few extra bonuses who cares God will provide and there's a lot of other things that he's doing in my life but I just want to give glory to God for what he did amen God bless you amen he'll honor that amen we got one special brother Angelo and sister um Victoria this morning then we'll invite our pastor out amen praise God [Music] [Music] same God he's the same God sing God I will be discourage even when I'm discouraged I'll remind my soul of all you've done before I won't be distracted even in the distraction I will trust the one who is greater than a store say I will trust the one who is greater than the storm I don't need another reason I don't need more convincing the same God who made a way is the same God who's here today even in my darkest moments this will be the truth I'm holding the same God who made a way is the same God who here [Music] today I be [Music] and I will worship yes I will [Music] worship I will whatever comes [Music] me I don't need another reason I don't need more convincing the same God who made a way is the same God who's here today

everybody looking good looking nice happy smile on the face and everything amen so it means somebody got a victory over the devil somehow somebody shook that mamb off amen glory to God we greet you all in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ both visible and invisible audience amen I was going over my uh my voice message at the dealer so when I was waiting for my car to be fixed so I look and the total messages I had was 127 voic ma praise God so I had to go one by one one by one so I managed probably to go slightly over 50 and I realized there was a brother it's an elder in Canada brother Ed ker probably some of you know him and he left me couple messages so I had to return and we talked a wonderful brother a minister an old pastor and uh he's a veteran I told him I said you are you an elder you a veteran and he sent greetings to the church so he's really on page he knows about the five Garment of Joseph and everything I say wow this invisible audience we got many people maybe some of them will meet them in heaven amen and they will be saying brother stepen we were part of that church so wherever you are God richly bless you amen and this morning any family members we do not have visitors we have family members so first time second time in spoken word God richly bless you I heard that uh my mother is here God bless you Sister Mary welcome amen you can tell where brother khala got that one [Laughter] from praise be to the name of the Lord glory to God she's really home and that's the way we want you to be so when you get in this church we get excited because the word make us excited amen glory to God I believe each person every one of us we up to date with the sermon we are reading our cood book our church ches at 70 weeks of Daniel the seals adoption or somebody is listening to the message of the hour I was talking to my wife there was a message that I was trying to play and every time I put that message I go to sleep and it was like a 30 minute message every time I I want to go to sleep I put it I said this is 30 minute I'm going to listen to it and go to bed as soon as it start I'm sleep as soon as it I say what is going on and only yesterday I was able to listen to the message and it was actually a funeral service that brother brandham was preaching on expression and it happened I told my wife it happened after the departure of a minister of the Gospel in the message brother barudi I say so the Lord kept that message just for me to hear he it at the same time and if you listen to that message you won't even cry because the way brother brandham explained death and then what happened it's really beautiful and I say God so you save this message just to make sure you comfort me whenever this man of God is going on to be with the Lord so remember the family in prayer he passed away in Canada had the heart attack to the best that I can get so pray for the family so the Lord will uh strength and his wife and everything amen amen Lord's willing this coming Saturday it's our Young's men meeting so you check on the text message uh the group chat and you will see where it's going to be and uh the young Sisters Meeting wonderful I'm still waiting uh sister Devon you know what to do so you do it before time and Lord's willing uh June the 29th will be the question and answer I believe I got everything covered brother Glenn if I forgot something you let me know we clear brother ky say we clear so let's get on the word again please forgive me if I have not replied to your messages that was just the voicemail not to mention the text messages the WhatsApp messages the email and they keep piling up every day you remove 30 you got 40 so so be very patient with me sometime we got emergency you got to leave everything and you handle the emergency first before you get there so I begin to understand when brother Bram was saying he get to a room and the room is filled with invitation and he didn't know what to do he have to pray and pick one and just go the way the Lord lead him so sometime it's hard but we will try by God's grace amen I know the list is getting longer so be patient with me whoever we need to talk to amen let's go to our scripture same one because we were not able to even move Genesis 39 and the reason why I'm putting Genesis 39 is to show you where we are at and what we are still dealing with amen until we move to the next stage amen this thing is so loaded prise God never thought we're going to be in part uh 15 Genesis 39 verse1 if you dare you can say amen amen and Joseph was brought down to Egypt and Piper an officer of pharaoh captain of the Guard an Egyptian bought him of the hands of the ishmaelite which had brought him down there you might be seated and the Lord was with Joseph we found out that this was disclosed in the house of Piper in other word when Joseph is put to work when Joseph is put to work amen this is when the hand of the Lord unfolded it doesn't mean God was not with him God was already with him God is the one that gave him the dreams but the way God begin to unfold in the house of Piper is different than in the house of Canaan so what I want you to remember is a work you remember that last Sunday yes a work that's when God begin to unfold himself amen verse uh two and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian yes sir I was looking for you there we go and his master saw that the Lord was with him and that the Lord made all that he did to prosper in his hand and Joseph found Grace in his sight and he served him Joseph a servant and he made him overseer over all his house and all that he had put into his hand so whatever will happen in the future is not something new somebody was given a story to manage amen were you here this morning amen I was back there you were inside here so you should be even getting this quicker than me don't worry I know how to handle those stuff I know how to handle stuff in the message God put me through a path where I come across Doctrine and things and all kind of stuff and I didn't know why now I begin to understand let's break that religious spirit that's right five and he came to pass from the time that he had made him Overseer in his house and over all that he had in other way they found this thing down at level whatever level and now somebody pull it to the upper level amen amen uh I'm just reading the Bible I didn't prepare the testimony woo did we talk did we text each other you heard that it's showing you potentials am amen that are hidden in other word you are not empty that's right you are filled with potential am depending on the ministry you are under amen the ministry will either block uhhuh now you starting that road again or unblock the potential amen [Applause] amen I won't take the woman out of her place to God but she's not dumb that's right I gave you a here brother Bram say she's a byproduct in the body not in the spirit so value your wife amen she's not stupid amen she might be the one God send in your life to hander your [Applause] finances you need her input that's right how many you the one that is studying this I'm trying to stay on my subject how many years did Jesus preach how many years three and a half how many years is the brde preaching why more is given to the brother am I saying something different all the attention of the entire Bible from Genesis Adam never fell he didn't sin the one who start the problem is a woman and the one who produced Jesus Christ who brought him forth It's a woman yes go on stay right there okay don't worry you're going to get something sooner amen amen and he came to pass from the time that he had made his over him overseer I can take you to scripture that will spin your head that's it that's it a wife is a companion amen amen God is male and female if you have male no female you don't have God am because Adam was created in the image and the likeness of who God and he created him how male and female so God is how male and female when Jesus was dying why was he giving birth amen marriage is a good thing amen that's why we got the marriage of the Lamb amen why is the Lamb getting married why he he was single when he came here to die for you but not now it's a marriage of the Lamb amen amen amen Oh Glory to God amen amen amen amen he's the head we are what the body so the body need the head and the head need the body both of them need each other that's right when you put them together then you got the full entity am glory to God and that he the Lord blessed the Egyptians house verse five for Joseph's sake and the blessing of the Lord was upon all that he had in the house and in the field clear let's go to Luke Chapter 2 glory to God amen amen amen amen amen amen amen amen marriage is complimentary what you miss this one doesn't I don't even want to dig [Music] deep because you become really one when you married you can read between the line am amen amen amen amen didn't Paul say that husband love your wife as one Christ loves the church and there is no way you can uh not treating your wife well because it's your body I don't know who's doing something that he need to [Applause] change leave that woman alone have you ever carry a baby for month do your job let her do her job and the whole kingdom is moving forward because Jesus say A House Divided or a kingdom divided will not stand so you want a headache in your marriage continue to stay divided this one pulling this way this one pulling this way you will see how far you going to go you'll find out you have been on the same spot because you're not going nowhere uhh okay if I'm here if I pull this way and then somebody pull this way cancel out have I changed somewhere no what did The Interpreter say he cancel each other amen [Laughter] put your effort together amen and move to One Direction either you go to the right or you go to the left but at least you're moving on in life [Applause] amen I can live without my wife good can good women are complicated so is your mother she's a woman too have I say something wrong your mother is a woman so what are you talking talking about if there is a message that should respect a woman it's the message of amen amen it bring the woman to her right perspective am to her correct [Applause] place we took the message upside down and look at the women that they are like dumb creature byproduct byy product go go talk to your mother like that [Laughter] 42 it's a Mysteries am amen it's a mystery pray with a woman you're going to go your high blood pressure would go up and you will learn and and when he has 12 please let me go and when he was 12 years old they went up to Jerusalem this is Jesus after the custom of the feast Lord help me if I can reach here and when they had fulfill the days as they return their child not even a young adult Jesus ter behind in Jerusalem you remember that Sunday and Joseph and his mother in other Joseph knew not of it but they supposing him to have been in the what company we don't see him so he must be hanging around with his friend but the 12 years old was not hanging around

wented day Journey amen how can you go one day Journey you don't even check on the son I know right let me leave that let me go this side way and they sought him among their kings folks and

days to find somebody let me leave it I'm sorry amen so much here and found him where in the temple praise God sitting in the midst of the what doctors both hearing them and asking them what questions

among his brother when we stop and on our way home my wife point out something to me and it and it was concerning the sisters so as soon as she pointed out to me the spirit of the Lord struck me that it was something that I was missing and by the time I begin to look at that amen the Holy Spirit unfolded a little bit more amen if you notice Joseph is a man Jesus was a man Elisha was a man David was a man what about sister you will understand your testimony today amen amen in Genesis 24 Abraham was grown up yes amen amen and Abraham called elzer he said elzar I want you to go get a wife for

Hallelujah but the unspoken word am H come from the Brad amen amen amen can I continue am the true thunders of God come from the BR amen we can all read the message everybody can listen to the T but who will get the T who really get the revelation of what the tap say only the Bride of Jesus Christ we clear are we clear knows both part elezar knows both part he knows the spoken and the unspoken word he knows it and to the public he will always release the spoken part that's why brother Bram say a mystery on come on is a truth that was hidden and it is revealed and brother Bram say even though it's revealed there is still a supernatural element amen despite the Revelation so you can read this message but you don't see what I see are we together amen Have I Lost somebody sir have I

53 C I mean gallon and how many do we have so the criteria is not giving the word but being able to produce the work amen [Applause] amen Joseph where Elisha where David where the criteria to get this woman is what not a false labor no sir no sir am am am are we together he have to come from her own amen are we together amen are we together amen let me look at the criteria of this woman jum to verse uh uh no I'm there and drink also let let the same be she that you have what appointed for who have appointed so who need to give that woman the inspiration who need to give her the inspiration who need to INSP because you must repeat the same word you must repeat the unspoken word amen not the spoken the unspoken word so the same angel that was there must be with you then we will know you the one that was appointed so the one that was appointed is the one that is willing to give what to the 10 camels without being asked for amen can I continue amen can I continue amen you have appointed for your servant Isaac and thereby shall I know that you have shown what kindness unto my master are you there amen and he came to pass before he had done what speaking you have not even finished the thought brother Stephen and somebody's screaming why are they screaming because they are catching the unspoken am amen before it spoken somebody already seen that who is showing you that

preach here prick your soul amen what is in this message that matches your heart that when they say you say that is nothing but the truth it means you and the message are blood related because you came somewhere and you are going somewhere you came from eternity and you're going back to God Amen Lord help me my friend verse uh 16 and the de the demel was how very fair to look upon was that the criteria no it is part of the package amen amen was that a part no if you pick the right one am they are the one filling the blank amen amen if Solomon you ask for wisdom God will add riches amen and

giving him drink she said I who ask her no one I will draw water for who thy camels also how many camels what kind of task is she putting herself into not one C how many do you realize what you trying to tackle but the criteria for marriage is connected to the work you going to do amen don't worry my friend don't worry my friend they made sure those cam was completely empty store down pull the store upst let me just continue and she HED and emptied the picture in the water the TR and slowly went again to the world no how and ran again and she did what until the well to draw water did she

not and he came to pass as the camels had done what drinking every camel is filled that the man took what a golden earring so the once it is complete the task is complete then comes the blessing [Applause] amen so the criteria for the wife of ISAC was based upon the Willing work am everybody okay amen listen to brother Bram brother Bram said the beautiful Rebecca he had never seen her he never knew who she was but elazar was hunting her up and he found her by the weakness of what the Holy Spirit you understand that now the angel of the Lord he prayed and said God give me favor today that I may find a wife for my master and then when Rebecca came to the water the what the camels the camel which was the son that she was what willing to go got on the cam and went to do what meet so the go the giving of the camel water was actually a son that the woman is ready for marriage amen don't worry it's soaking my friend don't worry my friend it's soaking brother Bram say oh my I think of that beautiful Rebecca that afternoon doing what watering the camel watering the very everything that was going to do what take to her to her bride that is what he was so the work that she was doing she was actually putting gasoline amen Amen on the very vehicle uh-huh amen that's going to take her uh-huh to her husband Amen in other words she was under preparation the work that you're doing under your father Roof oh whichever place God places you do it correctly do it willingly cook a home with joy God Is Watching waiting until you reach the level that hallu they came on you giving you didn't know you were preparing your own Road you are guaranteeing your marriage and you are also preparing your vehicle if you don't give enough water you going to get in trouble so you better make sure the C are satisfied brother Bram say water and the Cel represent what power and the Church of the Living God today is rejoicing and watering the water power of the Holy Ghost that shall pick her up what someday and take her where Yonder to do what meet the Isaac in the air for the wedding what supper hallelujah what amen hallelujah hallelujah Rea did not know that the camel she was giving water is the camel that's going to take her home but me and you we know that whatever we feeding to listen let me listen let me let me read brother Bram brother Bram said many times we substitute so much instead of what the word especially what today we are substituting what phenomenal we are substituting what a lot of other things that shouldn't be after all churches for what preaching the word testimonies are what are fine and different things that we do is what is wonderful but we must give the what word first place because it is for what The Sinner and for the people that has what the Holy Spirit also Jesus said when sat tempted him he said it is what written men shall not live by what by bread alone continue my friend but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God see the Holy Spirit feed on the water the word of God he takes the word and places it where into your heart and he makes you how grow in strength and what good Bible Exposition and I love it I love to sit and give a good Bible teacher who takes the Bible and does what and lays it out then the spirit of what kindness and what and meekness with it where it takes root in good what soft ground and goes to what growing the cam that you are feeling today is the holy spirit that is in you amen that's why I'm in encouraging you read the Bible listen to the message listen to the T because you are feeding your own camel amen the more you feed in your camel the bigger the camel is growing in other words you doing yourself a favor listen to this my friend I love the word don't you amen and you know why you love the word you have the what the Holy Spirit in you for the Bible says that man does not live by what by bread alone but by what every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God so the Holy Spirit feeds on the what the word and then when you hear what the word everyone want to do what to hear it no matter every little piece of what of literature that they can pick up they do what they read it and they listen to the what the radio and they go to a church and so forth because they are longing for that Fellowship around what the word but the pr says God's love what the truth and the truth shall do what set you free God want you to know what the truth and Christ is what the truth the Holy Ghost and the consideration to his his word and if the Holy Ghost is where in you he feeds on what the word of God and not on what television and true story magazine and love what books that is you people calling yourself Christian wrap around stuff like that amen why do your children you fill in the blank let me read this and then we're going to go my friend I just love to read what the word you know the Holy Spirit feeds what on the word it is written men shall not live by what by bread alone but by what every word that proceeded out of the mouth and if you just take it how many days each day not just as a what a routine not a routine be uh-uh amen am but just to oh I say to just make it that your heart do what Graves for it to just sit down how many days each day and read what so much out of the Bible you will be surprised what he shall do to your spiritual what grow he certainly will do what will the more you feeding your camel the holy spirit in your life you are preparing your body change because the Bible says that if a spirit that ra what that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell where in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall do what also Quicken your mortal Body by what his spirit that dwelleth in you when you read the message you are doing yourself a favor when you reading the Bible you doing yourself a favor you are actually watering the very holy spirit that will Quicken your body and change you one day amen and that is the identification of the bread she's willing to feed the Holy Ghost to take the Holy Ghost to church on Wednesday and take the Holy Ghost to church on Sunday and even at home at work wherever you are you are constantly feeding on the word hallelujah the criteria for Rebecca to be the wife is to produce work willingly not being forc and it was not an easy work it was 10 Cel brother Bram speak about a story of a young man from Chicago amen that was looking for a wife too amen he went somewhere yes and in that place there was a home where they overbed women that's right with their cousin right and
