to make it live in our hearts and that's what we desire this evening lord is to be living epistles written and read of all men bless our fellowship together now bless our service back home tonight in jesus christ's name we pray amen reading from leviticus chapter 25 and i want to read verse number 10 before you have your seats this evening and you shall hallow the 50th year and proclaim liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof it shall be a jubilee unto you and you shall return every man unto his possession and you shall return every man unto his family amen may the lord add his blessings to the reading of the word tonight as you have your seats and i'd like to speak by the help of the lord for just a little bit tonight the sound of jubilee i believe we're living in an hour of jubilee this evening the sound has gone forth and we've heard the trumpet amen the message of the hour that has brought us liberty and uh freedom from all the things of bondage the denominational systems and the worldly ideas and all those things and by the grace of god amen we're sitting here tonight and standing here a man of people that are liberated by the the word of god amen so as we uh look at these verses and we know the history behind it how that god had brought the children of israel out of egypt's bondage placed them in the land and he he gave them specific instructions to every seven years they would have a time of rest a year of rest and then after seven seven years or 49 years the 50th year would be the year of jubilee amen and in that year every slave every man that got in debt and had to sell himself as a slave a man or whatever brought him into this position by the law amen in this 50th year he could lay down his hole he could throw down his rake amen he could get off the horse he could do put away everything that he was working with and go back home because it was the year of jubilee amen and i believe tonight amen that the message that has come it has done more than just hear hear a voice it has brought liberty to the people of god and given us victory in jesus christ tonight amen and let us be able to go back to our family amen go back to our homeland go back to our possessions and take hold of what god had given us amen now this inheritance that the children of israel had it was a perpetual inheritance in other words it was handed down from generation to generation amen and there's only one generation that's handed it down to us and that's the generation of jesus christ he has handed it to us tonight and given us brother greg the liberty amen and the freedom and the possession amen of our land amen now brother branham told us in the message titled job 1955 he said and during the time of slavery before the emancipation of the proclamation was signed while they tell me that the slaves in the south would climb up the hill there's going to be free at sunrise he said some could climb a little higher than the others the older ones couldn't get up there amen the younger went on to the top of the hill for as soon as they seen the sun amen they were free amen so the ones that got the highest just as soon as the sun popped over the top of the the hill they said we are free they hollered it down to the next group that one hollered it down to the next that one hollered it on down we are free amen on down the hill passing and every man that sees the esso in is free this evening he whom the son hath made free is free indeed tonight and i'm so so thankful amen that many years ago he set me free to this evening and gave me a liberty in jesus christ now i've been speaking at home on being in christ and i'll tell you there's no other place we need to be but in christ this evening and if we get in christ then everything else will fall in place tonight amen now as we look at this this the the weekly sabbath amen is to give a centennial rest for man and beast and god said man shall work six days sally labor and on the sabbath day or the seventh day shall he rest and after six years of unbroken harvest was to be a rest for the land unto the lord the year of jubilee we done quoted that but let me just go over this for just a moment to set my foundation and at the end of seven weeks of years gave an opportunity of restoration for the poor uh those who had been compelled to alienate their lands and listen tonight we were compelled by our elder brother adam we were sold into slavery amen but thank god our our brother jesus amen he has come tonight amen he has set us free and not only that but in this age in which we're living in amen he has come once again amen and taken his word and brought liberty to those that have been bound by creeds and dogmas and traditions of men and ideology amen that's kept us away from the very land of the word of god amen that provides us everything that we have need of in its hour amen to make it through and to be victorious amen now we realize that these seven years or these jubilees or these these days of rest it points on to the jubilee the redemption of the purchased possession ephesians 1 14 when all the disabilities that have been following us shall be made good amen and we shall regain all the inglorious inheritance that god has has given us which was alienated by our sin this evening amen and with what joy must thousands have heard the notes of that trumpet sounding out amen over the land and the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised incorruptible and we shall all be changed amen and and we shall end we shall inherit the kingdom of god now i don't know about you this evening but i'm looking forward to a change brother noel johnson from the church there he says i'm going to lose 50 years and 50 pounds in a second we're going to have a change you know i i have a thing people think i'm crazy but it's okay i carry a comb in my pocket now brother sam people say why do you do that brother joe because i am expecting a liberation out of this old body of flesh and i'm gonna put on a body fashion like under his glory body amen i'm not gonna be bald anymore i'm gonna have that head of hair that i had when i was 16 years old why because there's going to be a chain sweep over and something is going to happen to me amen and i'm going to be restored back to my original state tonight amen [Music] now brother branham said in redeemer redemption he said let's go to calvary tonight to get out of the things of the world oh he's wonderful know that we are free he who the son has made free is free indeed and you was free to calvary when jesus paid the oscillation price to god the father when he suffered in flesh and died and he repaid or paid the price of your redemption that you could be redeemed back to god now where where were we redeemed to we were redeemed back to our rightful position amen as sons and daughters of god amen adam when he was in his rightful position before the fall he could speak to that tree sitting over there and say move over yonder he could speak to the wind and say wind be still he could speak to the fishes or all the animals he could speak to the lions he could speak to the bears he could pet them and and play with them amen but sin came in the picture and when it did adam could no longer speak to the tree and move over there he could no longer speak to the wind but when jesus christ paid the price amen when he redeemed me he restored me back to that position and as i have need and god moves upon me i can speak to the wind well brother joel don't believe that well that just makes you an unbeliever i have experienced it we were in the philippines a few years ago brother dole jackson and myself and the brothers there they wanted to come across the ocean to one of them the meetings from one island to another and the wind was so boisterous and the waves so hard and high that they couldn't get across in their little boat so they asked us to pray and we prayed and after a little while we got word the brothers are on their way the waves have died down the winds have ceased amen and when they got there they said praise the lord we made it and god gave them a big old fish that they could sell and buy their gas to go back home with the wind died down and it was so so dead and so flat and no wind and we like to roast it we like to roast it next time we're going to pray lord stop the wind on the ocean but keep it blowing here well maybe some of you get it tomorrow and some of you get it next week amen we're going to pray specific don't just stop the wind but stop it on the ocean and let it continue blowing here because we need to breathe amen oh let me tell you amen what what was that that is part of that restoration that we can ask anything in jesus name and he said my father will give it you amen but we've got to have faith as we sing the song only believe all things are possible to them that believe tonight amen so we have been redeemed back to our rightful position this evening now that word proclaim as they began to proclaim liberty from the top of the mountain on down and back there when the trumpet blew or the the rams horn blew amen it was a sound of jubilee a sound of deliverance a sound of victory amen and that word proclaim it's a primitive root and it means to call out to that is to properly address by name but it's used in a wide variety of applications to berate itself or berate self that are bitten call for or call for or call forth or call self or call upon to cry unto to be famous to be a guest to invite to mention to give to a name to preach to make a proclamation to pronounce to publish to read renowned and to say amen so all of those definitions amen they point back to what jesus did whenever he was hanging there on the cross the nails were in his hand the crown was on his head the stripes were on his back and he cried out it is finished i'm here to tell you tonight what was finished was my redemption and yours this evening and it has been restored back to you and i we have been restored back to our rightful position and we are no longer slaves this evening we are no longer bound by the nominational creed we are no longer bound by ideas of men amen we have been set free in christ jesus tonight amen exodus 20 and verse 2 says i am the lord thy god which have brought thee out of the land of egypt out of the house of bondage amen he said i have done it i have delivered you and you're sitting here tonight amen you're no longer a slave to sin you're no longer a slave to denominational ideas and dogmas you're no longer a slave amen to situations that held you back you're not under that anymore tonight friend you have been set free you have been liberated amen and by that liberation amen what's happening in your life is you're moving forward in the things of god amen you're not held back you're not held back by by some man's idea but thank god there is a liberty in jesus christ there is a freedom tonight amen that says come up a little higher just like the spirit told john amen come up a little higher come up into the heavenlies this evening and that's where god wants us to be he don't want us to be with our our mind on earthly things he wants us to be heavenly minded and realize this world is fading away this world is passing away but thank god there is a land beyond the river there is a place there is a resting place there is a place that i call home and by the grace of god i'm going back to that place [Music] brother brahma said in jubilee year he said now if you'll notice in symbol that jubilee year repeats now again every so often there is a renewal a revival strikes the land just the great welts revival it closed not long ago the people we might go and have billy grahams and oral roberts is all over the land everywhere and no matter how much we try how great we try to organize the people together and ban them it takes god to bring a revival y'all don't mind if i make myself at home do you good i was going to brother madam said we might have all the billy grahams now some of you i'm sure have been over to the billy graham library and you've seen all the masses of people and all the people that gave their heart to jesus amen and and he led them to a repentance but he did not lead them to the baptism of the holy ghost he led them to a head knowledge but i preached at the church sunday i said we need to get it out of our head and into our heart we need to get it about 12 inches down amen we can have it up here all day long and it won't help us a bit all it'll do is give us a little education in the word all it'll do is give us a little head knowledge but when it comes down here it will change our life it'll make a new creature out of us a new creation because it's no longer just a middle mental conception but it is a birth in our heart that changes our life tonight and that's what god is looking for he is looking for change lives by the power of the resurrected christ this evening [Music] he said no matter how much we try or how hard we try we cannot bring a revival i laid my jacket off i didn't have one in my pocket i left my briefcase back there in the office i didn't have one in my briefcase amen but something is stirring in your heart something is moving amen when the word of god comes forth you can't sit there like a knot on the log you can't sit there like a bump on a pickle because something down inside of you says that's the word of god that's the reality that's thus saith the lord and that's what set me free tonight the liberty of jesus christ it has brought victory in my life it's given me joy that i didn't have it's given me peace that i didn't have it's given me rest that i didn't have it's given me something amen that i can lock my arms around and say blessed be the name of the lord this is what's going to bring about a change in me [Music] psalms 146 and verse 7 which execute a judgment for the oppressed which give us food to the hungry the lord loses the prisoners paul and silas were thrown in a roman jail because they were preaching the gospel and long about midnight they began to sing even though they were in jail they had a liberty amen that the jailer didn't know nothing about they had a freedom amen that those around them other prisoners they didn't have that they began to sing and the bible said there was a great earthquake and the stalks fell off and the chains fell off and the doors opened and the jailer got excited oh no the prisoners they'll escape and i'll have to give an account my life for theirs but paul and silas cried out don't worry we're all here we ain't going nowhere we're in the midst of a revival our hearts are stirred our spirits are moved we're rejoicing amen oh i take tonight that's why amen they can't take us away from this message they may try amen forgive me tonight they may say there's something better they may say it's not real it's not because i've got a book in my hand it's because i've got the word in my heart by the greg that's what lives tonight that's what's real it's christ the word in me this evening that's what's real it's not a it's not a picture on the wall it's christ in my heart it's christ in me the hope of glory [Music] it's the lord that loosens the prisoners and the seal of the antichrist the prophet would say it like this i hope it's okay to read notice when the jubilee sounded the man could drop his hole if he wished to but what if he didn't want to what happened then they must take him down to the judges and the judges take him to the post and they bored his ear through with an awl and from that time on never no more it was a sign that he could never hear that trumpet of jubilee no matter how many jubilees he lived through amen he would never be able to do it again because he was marked because he rejected oh let me tell you tonight i don't want to be one of those with my ear bored through i don't want to be one of those that rejected the word of god i don't want to be one of those that said i don't believe it i can't accept it i'm here to tell you i have seen it real i have seen it alive i have seen it tonight and i know beyond the doubt it's not what i heard i have experienced jesus christ i have experienced this message it's real [Applause] it's not a dried-up formal doctrine of men it's the living word made flesh it's the living reality of jesus christ tonight [Music] they question it forgive me tonight they question it and they say well i don't believe it well guess what i do and if you don't that makes you an unbeliever [Applause] and jesus said blessed are they that believe for they shall be saved and they that believeth not shall be i didn't say it jesus did i believe it with all of my heart what other what other generation has seen what we've seen what other generation has heard what we've heard what other people have seen almighty god come down and wrap himself in flesh again listen what did he do in jesus christ he was the sinless virgin-born son of god and god dwelt in him in the fullness of the godhead bodily but in our generation there was a sinner that was saved by grace that god came down brother greg and he used the vessel he used a vessel and he spoke through that vessel and that vessel amen said thus saith the lord jesus said i say unto you but our prophet said thus saith the lord and where has it failed i may not be able to explain it i may not be able to understand it that's not the key the key is if thou can't believe jesus nowhere nowhere did he ever say you got to sit down and explain it he didn't say it says she got to figure it out what he said was if thou canst believe all things are possible [Applause] a a l all-inclusive without exception everyone so i can believe there was a a cloud formed by angels [Music] i can believe there was a pillar of fire that rested on his shoulder and he had a heavy bible in this hand and a light hat in this hand and this shoulder was like that what was that that was the angel of god leaning on his shoulder brother madam said that angel was about 200 pounds about six foot tall or so amen and you know when when somebody would come and lean on my shoulder about that size i would be into oh brother joe that's silly i'm here to tell you tonight i believe it with all of my heart [Applause] how do you know it's real brother joe last time i went to the philippines i was preaching brother royale soriano who just went to be with the lord i'm sure you've heard that amen but in his pulpit his camp meeting there as i was preaching my topic that night was not just another service and i was i was elaborating on if jesus doesn't come by this service is all in vain if he doesn't visit us and show himself and minister to the needs of the people speak to the people's heart we've just had another protracted meeting but as i was speaking those things there was a sister in the back she just felt impressed to snap some photos and she snapped four clicks and the first one was was clear the second one was clear the third one was clear but the fourth one all across the pulpit there was like seven licks of cloud and i've got the picture i can show you now that don't make me nothing but that's just god confirming his word and that night there was a sister who had been in a motorcycle car accident and she'd had pain in her back for months but whenever i was making those comments and that that supernatural event took place i believe it was supernatural amen and when that took place she testified afterwards i had a pain since then and a couple other things that god did in that service amen now i want you to understand tonight if you don't come by here on beatrice avenue or beatrice street tonight it's just another service but i am looking for jesus to come by here tonight and walk up and down the avenues and not only that but up and down the avenues of our heart and minister to us and help us this evening because we are a needy people but thank god he knows my name he knows my address he knows my need tonight and he's able to come by and minister to me and you this evening amen luke chapter 1 verse 74. that he would grant unto us that we being delivered out of the hand of our enemies might serve him without fear i want you to understand tonight fear is one of the greatest things people battle in this day nerves oh i just don't know i'm afraid about tomorrow i'm afraid what might happen i i'm i'm afraid about my children i'm afraid about this i'm afraid about that i'm afraid of covid i'm not afraid of it i respect it but i trust god you know i worked in the pharmacy for almost 23 years and in that pharmacy they had one whole section probably as wide as this pulpit about yay tall just shelf after chef after shelf nerve pills neurotic pills to make people feel better amen to help them calm themselves well i know a gospel that'll take care of all of that and it's the gospel of jesus christ [Music] and you know people were so so neurotic that you know they they would go crazy if they you know their prescription run out and they couldn't get it refilled and they just go crazy and and and you know get all upset and all been out of shape i'm here to tell you this gospel ain't never going to run out [Music] brother branham said you get the holy ghost and you got everything you need to make a rapture where's it at it's in the holy ghost and you get the holy ghost in you tonight and listen you don't have to worry about tomorrow you don't have to worry about next week you don't have to worry about whether you'll make a rapture because the holy ghost has already provided that rapture is inside of you tonight and it will carry you to that body change oh how am i going to make it i got news for you you ain't oh brother joe you just said we had everything we had need of to make it that's because he's already made it for you [Music] i heard the prophet say coming down the road said if you come and ask him to heal you he can't if you come and ask him to save you he can't do it brother sam why 2 000 years ago on a hill called calvary he paid redemption's price and in that price was paid for deliverance for joy for victory for salvation for healing for everything that you have need of tonight he has already paid for it all we've got to do is accept it this evening [Music] brother joe that's too simple well i heard a prophet preach god hides himself and reveals himself in simplicity jesus came god in flesh and he wrapped himself in a body of flesh called jesus christ and he spoke a language that still causes the translators trouble they couldn't can't figure out some of the words he used how do we translate that what what do we what do we associate that with because he came in simplistic form he didn't come with a high education a scholarly degree amen come down to the priest the high priest and say i'm here to take over he just did it he just did it well how did he do it brother joe he ripped the veil in twain by an earthquake and what did that do that showed that we no longer have to have a a natural man to go in take an offering for us because our offering as hung there on calvary's hill he paid the price once and for all for my past sins for my present sin and for my future sins and i no longer have to bring a lamb and put my hands on its head and watch the the priest slay that lamb i just look to jesus and live i just go to him and say lord i didn't mean to do that i'm sorry i messed up i'm sorry i made a mistake and if any man calls him he is faithful and just to forgive him [Applause] if we're not careful we'll get that catholic spirit on us and try to do it by works didn't you hear jesus he said it is finished the work is done we don't have to work he did the work tonight he made the way in fact he is the way [Music] luke chapter 4 verse 16 and he came to nazareth where he had been brought up and as his custom was he went into the synagogue on the sabbath day and stood up for it to read now a lot of people today they say well you don't have to go to church you can be just as good a christian at home as you can going to church well you need to show them that scripture he went to the synagogue as his custom was right in other words he didn't go just that day and read the scripture and not go no more he continually went to the temple and there was delivered unto him the book of the prophet isaiah and when he had opened the book he found a place where it was written he knew what he was looking for he was looking for the verse that pertained to himself i heard a prophet say if you can't see christ in every verse of the bible you need to read it again well what's that got to do with me brother joe well you are in christ so if you can see christ then you can see yourself in him tonight so if you can't see yourself in him and him in the verses read it again verse 18 the spirit of the lord is upon me because he hath anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor he hath sent me to heal the brokenhearted to preach deliverance to the captives and recovering of sight to the blind to set at liberty them that are bruised to preach the acceptable year of the lord and he closed the book and gave it again to the minister and sat down and the eyes of them all was upon him and he began to say to them this day this scripture is fulfilled in your ears i'd like for you to understand something tonight church that god has once again fulfilled scripture in this day that we're living in he said behold i send unto you how many yous do we have in the church what about the rest of you are you are you a y-o-u i'm speaking to you and you and you and you and you and you and you and you and you behold i send unto you elijah the prophet and he shall turn the hearts of the fathers to the children and the hearts of the children to the fathers lest i come and smite the earth with a curse now what he's wanting to do is us children turn our faith back to the faith of the pentecostal fathers now my dad made a statement many years ago he said and we have it engraved on a plaque and that statement was god started his church like he wanted it how did he start it they came staggering out of the upper room under the influence of the holy ghost speaking in other tongues and they had an experience with god that changed mother sam their life and it caused him to no longer be afraid of the roman guard but they had a boldness to speak the word of god and to declare what christ was and what he had done for the people of god that's how god started his church and the next part of that statement was the first part god started his church like he wanted it and now god wants his church like he started it god don't want a dead dry formal church god wants a church baptized with the holy ghost and fire he wants a church that is living breathing and moving under the auspices of the holy ghost he don't want her dead traditional and formal he wants her alive this evening and the only way we can have that is if christ is in that church amen romans 6 17-18 but god be thanked that you were everybody say were the servants of sin but you have obeyed from the heart that form of doctrine which was delivered you being then made free from sin you became the servants of righteousness let it settle just a minute you obeyed from a heart that form of doctrine which was delivered to you being then made free from sin you became the servants of righteousness brother dan daisley used to talk about going to india and he said i've seen a lot of holy men so-called in india he said you want to see a real holy man look up here now they make themselves holy by their actions by their like the catholics do taking a uh scourge and beating themselves on the back bringing their penance like martin luther was climbing up the steps on broken glass and he read the scripture in romans 8 the just shall live by faith and the revelation struck him he said i don't need to do this anymore it's not by works it's by faith but tonight tonight we are no longer a slave to sin we are no longer a slave to works because it's not by works that we are saved but it's by the grace of god amen and i am holy because there is a holy god living inside of me it's not by my works it's not by my beating myself on the back with a with a cord amen it's by the righteousness of jesus christ tonight he has made me meet to be partakers of the gospel of jesus christ tonight so so many people especially when it comes communion time i'm not worthy i'm not good enough i i i just don't feel worthy well can i tell you something you're right you're right you're not and you never will be [Music] but by the blood of jesus christ by the shed blood on calvary's heel i have been made worthy [Music] listen whenever that priest or that that worshiper came and they brought their lamb that that priest would say okay is this your lamb yes let me look at it they look for a blemish they look for a wrong color hair they look for a bad eye they look for a sore anything to disqualify that lamb and if that lamb was perfect in their eyes they said okay put your hands on his head and we done referred to that but we're gonna dramatically give it to you just a minute amen put your hands on its head and when they did that they identified themselves with their sacrifice i'm here to tell you tonight i have identified with my sacrifice and god himself testified this is my beloved son in whom i am well pleased and the prophet said in whom i am pleased to dwell [Music] so tonight i lay my hands upon the head of jesus christ and i claim his righteousness as my own this evening and by that i am perfect in the eyes of god [Applause] [Music] ii corinthians 3 17 now the lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the lord is there is liberty i i wonder why you're so free tonight [Applause] i wonder why you're rejoicing so because the spirit of the lord is here and he hath made you free he has given you a liberty to worship him to praise him amen to magnify his name and to recognize what he has done for you this evening he hath made me free [Music] hallelujah [Applause] now that's second corinthians 3 17 from the amplified version reads like this now the lord is the spirit and where the spirit of the lord is there is liberty emancipation from bondage true freedom [Music] his history shows us amen after that emancipation proclamation and after that sunrise when the the day of deliverance was was manifest there was not really still freedom right bear with me in that situation but i want to tell you tonight there ain't no bondages that's going to hold me back because i am free in christ tonight he whom the son hath made free is free indeed [Music] emancipation from bondage true freedom where is that it's in the spirit of the lord amen he hath made us free amen now matthew 11 2-6 when john heard or or when john's eyes crushed it over as brother branham described it he was down in prison and you know he just was wondering and trying to figure out whether it was real is this the messiah should we look for another you know what's going on here and the disciples of john that came to jesus and said this is what john's questioning jesus said to them go and report to john what you hear and see the blind receive their sight and the lame walk the lepers are cleansed by healing and the death hear and the dead are raised and the poor have the gospel preached to them and blessed joyful favored by god is he who does not take offense at me accepting me as the messiah and trusting confidently in my message of salvation now that was speaking about jesus christ but let's just let's just jump forward about two thousand years is that okay the death here the blind sea heard a story about the other day about a car being restored that was stolen you know the holy ghost arrested the thief and he turned around and brought the car back to the city it was stolen from amen uh you know the dead er raised all these things that that that jesus told the disciples to go tell john this is what's happening amen now what a simple explanation what a simple explanation to where brother sam is the message true or not all these things are happening show me in the church after they left the word of god where all these things are happening in the measure that they happen under this ministry you can't find it because because they they didn't believe it they didn't accept it they didn't receive it but god restored the gifts in the church he restored the power in the church he restored the word in the church and when all those things are restored what's going to happen the reality of god is going to be made manifest that church just like it started on the day of pentecost it's in action now [Applause] and jesus said and blessed joyful favored by god is he who does not take offense at me accepting me as the messiah and trusting confidently in my message of salvation let's bring it up to date and blessed joyful favored by god is he who does not take offense in me accepting me as the prophet for the 20th century for the seventh church aids message and trusting confidently in my message of deliverance oh brother joe you're misquoting the scripture no i'm just i'm just finding myself in the scripture is that all right i'm just finding myself in the verses of the bible i don't believe this message because my daddy was an usher in the meetings i don't believe this message because brother branham received a letter from my dad and said pray for my son he's got a condition he was born with a condition and brother adam turned the letter over and wrote on the back said brother greene be faithful pray at nine o'clock twelve o'clock and three o'clock and i believe your son will be all right and he won't need the operation i ain't had that operation yet i don't believe but because dad was in all those meetings i don't i don't believe this message because when the hood of death was on that lady my dad and mom was sitting about three or four rows behind that person that's not why i believe i believe tonight because i have met the jesus of this message [Applause] brother greg he changed my life he took an old sinner hard-hearted no good full of desires for the world and he changed that and he gave me a desire to serve god a desire to eat the book tonight and by his grace i stand here tonight as a trophy of this message [Applause] i remember the day mom and dad were leaving to go to brother branham's memorial service i remember that just like it was yesterday i was about four years old i was born in 61 that was in 65 66 so let's see five maybe five years old i remember that just like it was yesterday amen i didn't have an understanding then i didn't know what was going on but as i grew and as i gave my heart to the lord and i began to listen to the message of the hour and i began to recognize this is more than a man a sister in our church he's going on to the lo be with the lord now but she was in our church at the time and she went to the meetings uh this this day this scripture is fulfilled and uh if you've heard of brother the brother with lung cancer what was his name from west virginia anyway she was next in line behind him and and she was actually sitting on the platform behind him and he he called her out brother stephen and said there's there's a woman behind me said she's she's not here for herself since she's got a daughter that's grievously vexed of the devil and said mrs orders you know our song leader brother mike it was his great aunt that was there amen and and he spoke to her and said mrs orders go back to north carolina and find your daughter well as you believe now there's the key she oh she was excited she believed it but on the way home something began to happen and her faith began to drop and that daughter lived to be in her 70s and she never was fully delivered she was better but she was never fully do it listen they had a jail cell in their home she was so violent and so just just so destructive they had a jail cell she had one of her spells they had put her in the cell locked the key locked the door and and put the key out of her reach amen and she never did get delivered because faith dwindled and that that tells you enough tonight we need to make sure that our faith is true and pure and not dwindling don't look at the circumstances don't look at the situation look at the promise of the word of god because the word has power your doubts don't [Music] well they have power to make you miss the promise but they don't have power to perform the promise but the word tonight is a is a oh it's quick and powerful and sharper than a two-edged sword dividing us under the thoughts the bone the marrow and all those things amen so what we've got to do is not let our faith waver [Music] when the centurion came to jesus what did jesus say only belief [Music] and on the way there when the the messenger came and said trouble not the master your daughter's dead and i can imagine that centurion looking at jesus and jesus only believe don't doubt it's going to be okay [Music] you know when jesus went down to the pool of bethesda and he found this man that had been laying there for 30 and eight years right a long time and the waters were troubled many many times and that in that time frame and he struggled to get to the water but he couldn't make it but when jesus come in there and he began to speak to him and listen in layman's terms you know what he said you want to get well we'll that'll be made whole you want to get well well you know i ain't got nobody to help me get in the water that ain't what i ask you i didn't ask you do you need somebody to help you get in the water i ask you do you want to get well so let me ask you tonight do you want to get well do you want to be delivered do you want to have faith jesus is here to give you the answer to every question every problem every situation tonight if thou canst believe all things are possible to them that believe [Music] in the mark of the beast 1956 brother adam said notice every slave when he heard that trumpet sound he could throw down his hole or whatever he's working with and say i'm a free man i couldn't redeem myself but god through his grace hath declared a year of jubilee therefore i believe god and i don't have to work anymore and the laws of the land claimed him free what a beautiful type of today what a beautiful type of this message that has come it has set us free not only from denominationalism but it's also set us free from complexes it set us free from fear it set us free from worry it set us free from doubt it set us free from sickness it set us free from everything that would bind us down we're no longer slaves tonight we are free somebody shout i'm free i'm free i have been set free tonight hallelujah [Applause] going on in the mark of the beast brother who said we poor aliens nothing we could do if we kept every sabbath every new moon quit eating meat if we kept all kinds of days and done all kind of religious sacrifice we are under a load we are sold in sin our parents sold us out to sin in the garden of eden and we are laden under the bonds of sin and as a slave to the devil we are born in sin shaped and iniquity come to the world speaking lies there is nothing we can do to help us because our whole makeup our whole nature and everything we are is sin but he didn't stop there paragraph 64 he said but when the jubilee time come that we are free and the trumpet is the gospel the good news the trumpet was the gospel then good news you're no longer bound you're no longer have to live in sin you can go home and be free you don't owe any debts at all the whole emancipation of proclamation is done signed and you are free you're no longer bound to see in the church complexes they're history sickness it's history oh brother joe i still deal with this condition in that condition amen well you know when your faith reaches that point i have a simple illustration and i love to use this illustration [Music] and that 20 bill is not going to be mine after this service is over [Applause] he called a revelation and she did too the revelation is he has already provided it all i've got to do is take the promise of the word and wrap my arms around it it's mine it's mine forgive me for using a carnal carnal illustration and i'm i'm going to finish with this muhammad ali the great boxer everybody's heard of muhammad ali he went down and he signed a contract i'm going to fight joe frazier and i'm going to knock him out in such and such a round and he you know when they met and did their way in and all that and they bumped their gloves and shook hands and

calvary paid a price goes to that sanctuary not made by man and approached the throne and took the book come down come and get it amen [Music] did you fight for that book did you pay the price for that book did you clamp on the cross for that book [Music] were you stripped for that book he did it all all you have to do is just accept it church is so simple that's why i love the elders they like professional they know how to get to the point let me get a minute open roman 10. i was reading this at work i'm just going to give you two or three verses romans chapter 10. [Music] how many times did you hear him talking about the heart do you remember me telling you that there is a connection between the tongue and the heart do you see what signal he's giving me [Music] hallelujah look on verse 10 chapter 10 verse 1 roman paul is saying this i was just reading it at work he said brethren my heart's desire and prayer to god he has a desire and a prayer he wanted something to happen but he didn't stop at the desire he went with it in prayer look just one verse how he changed he said my heart desire and prayer to god for who is that there might be so israel was saved if you're praying for somebody to be saved that means they are not saved right look at that people let's look at these people that are not saved how are day verse two for i bear them who's them i bear them record that they have water as hell is a zeal to who but were they saved you see but not according to water for there being water zealous for god but ignorant zealous for god but ignorant ignorant of god's righteousness what brother joe labor tonight and going about to establish their own you see the mistake put your car there is nothing you have to do and going about to establish their own righteousness have not submitted themselves unto the righteousness of who so when you try to establish your own righteousness automatically you are showing your insubordination to the righteousness of god because you want to do it yourself and you're going to suffer amen for christ is the end of the water so the law has an end you want to stop the law in your life where do you have to reach for christ is the end of the law for righteousness to everyone that understand to everyone that do whatever simple the simplicity of the gospel is what you knock the devil with easy easy let me stop there the other one we're going to get it on sunday maybe amen it's so simple church you can manufacture this you can push this you cannot bring it in your briefcase you're not going to be able to do it god have his own program fall into line surrender yourself just believe just believe and you're going to see what god will do i told you about justification you can knock the devil out just by faith what did luther have more than that what else did luther have you have more than looter it's so easy the message that's why you hear me saying all the time the message is not complicated it is very simple very very simple until brother branham explained everything into a detail and you can grasp it you say god now i see it amen it is not your work you didn't start it god started and god is going to finish it the way he started hallelujah he's going to finish it the way that he started he made the way you didn't do it just believe like the brothers say who want to be you raise your hand that simple hand can get devil out of your house we want to do work we want to fast 20 days so when you come out there everybody's watching what happened you lose pond that was fasting doesn't want it do you want to get well no you know the situation is like i didn't ask that do you want to get where yes walls up there take up your bed and just go is it complicated how many devils did jesus get out of that how many therefore did jesus cast out because we expect jesus to stand and say you demon of paralysis you did one of i believe it was prostate come out and this come out and come out now was an hour walk do you want to get here yes see you i'm a man under authority speak the word that's what you want go ahead son of god you're a dog do you think jesus was calling him a dog by any chance do you know what jesus was doing he was telling her this is your healing okay i'm gonna give you the key to your healing take it sometimes his key comes different if you pick it up you say it's a dog you throw it away you don't understand he cannot call you dog just like that who made that woman understand the revelation of a dog who started to name the name dog the woman why did he start it why he didn't say you parrot when he's calling you there is something there he just handed her the key like hey the door is tight here and you keep pressing and because you're pressing i need to find something to reach out in his pocket dog take it and the woman take you say thank you i am really a dog and then the revelation when you accept what he tells you then the package unfold once once you accept it when you say this message is true then the message package unfold then you receive the revelation of the package that you receive that yes i am a dog and i take the crumbs that fell from the master table jesus stop say this one you must receive it from somewhere go your daughter did he cast out devils that's the gentile faith but random top that woman with hardy right church we have a true and living god you don't need me to pray for you because the preaching of that word was removing devils if you don't believe then we can lay hand on you like jewish until you get to the gentile if you want to i don't mind it we can still lay hand but the preaching of the gospel the way that anointing was flowing here just go home believe you're going to see some of the stuff you didn't even mention will be gone amen amen just remember that some of the stuff you didn't even mention [Music] if jesus would stand on the cross to count your your sin how long will it take how many days will it take and to count all the sicknesses and the syndrome and all the stuff how many seven names compound of jehovah jehovah rapha jehovah nisi jehovah chicano jehovah this this this god say let me make it simple he took all of them mix it together and put one just get one when you're saying jesus when jesus comes he's gonna look when the word jesus comes to you he screams you and he says what they wanted is something to be provided then jehovah jairo pull off if he looks at you he says this is not jehovah it's a situation of sickness then refer pull off that's why when you say jesus that's it jesus then the baby resurrected they didn't say jesus the baby resurrect when they said jesus jesus went there and look and say this is what is going on resurrection up so when the word is preached one word is gonna go to every avenue according to your need and when you find your need this one check this one check this one check this one check and everybody left this building blessed
