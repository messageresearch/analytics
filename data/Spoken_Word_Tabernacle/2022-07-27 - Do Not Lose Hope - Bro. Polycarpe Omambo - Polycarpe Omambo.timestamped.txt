[44:05] and it's the second oil
[44:13] this soil is different
[44:16] it is no lap for you to come to church
[44:20] and when you are in church you forget
[44:21] about everything you begin to feel good
[44:25] even if you are sick you begin to feel
[44:27] very good

[44:47] part you need to catch up quickly before
[44:49] we climb higher large wheeling on sunday
[44:52] amen
[44:53] i try to stay on the
[44:55] edge of the trail of the serpent i
[44:58] cannot dig deep i have to stay
[45:01] on the surface so we can keep roof
[45:04] in plain view if we dig then if brother
[45:07] branham can preach a sermon four hours
[45:10] whatever i'm going to take it would take
[45:12] a year
[45:14] amen
[45:15] brother branham said he took one he can
[45:17] take one sales and preach three months
[45:21] and then he preach one seal in one night
[45:23] so what do you think is under that hill
[45:27] and when we preach part one part two
[45:29] people don't understand
[45:30] it was a concentrated food
[45:35] so what you think it was one tape it's
[45:37] not one tip
[45:38] it is three months of sermon
[45:43] amen preaching one day
[45:47] in other words when you touch the
[45:48] surface it's unfold it's a sermon
[45:50] it's a sermon it's a servant it's a
[45:52] sermon how many if one seal is three
[45:55] months
[45:57] and i don't know what he meant by
[45:58] three-month weather it's only wednesday
[46:00] and sunday or it was monday tuesday
[46:02] wednesday thursday all the way to sunday
[46:05] so it's like 90 days how many sermons
[46:08] can come up of these hills
[46:11] that's why you keep seeing me traveling
[46:13] sales sales because it's all over the
[46:16] entire book
[46:18] was sealed by seven sales so if brother
[46:20] branham can preach the trail of this if
[46:22] one sermon it's three months and one
[46:25] trail of the sermon is
[46:27] serpent is four hours
[46:29] what do you think is it
[46:33] and did he ever preach that
[46:36] do you think he didn't preach it
[46:43] do you think he didn't preach it but i'm
[46:45] saying i'm going back to preach it and
[46:46] he never preached it do you think he
[46:48] never preached the surprise
[46:51] you need to know brother branham very
[46:53] well
[46:55] to know what it is do you know brother
[46:56] branham was preparing to preach the
[46:58] trumpet
[47:00] and he even want to run to the room
[47:02] and what did god tell him
[47:09] brother branham was preparing to preach
[47:11] the trumpet he even was looking for the
[47:13] room to go ahead and set everything up
[47:15] and god said you already preached the
[47:17] trumpet
[47:18] so even brother branham himself didn't
[47:20] know he was preaching the trumpet so
[47:23] where was those trumpet god say under
[47:25] the sixth hill so if you go to the sixth
[47:27] seal go find the trumpet
[47:31] amen amen go look it up like this if
[47:34] you're gonna see one trumpet second
[47:35] trumpet
[47:37] you need a second oil body
[47:41] amen
[47:42] so it tells you that the six seal is not
[47:45] really just the six cell
[47:47] and if you hitch the trumpet then the
[47:49] valves are poor there
[47:51] so what is in that section
[47:55] so this message is very deep
[47:58] very very very deep until you see things
[48:02] and you don't know what to do you wonder
[48:03] you say am i really seeing that or what
[48:06] amen so we'll try to stay a little bit
[48:10] on the surface to try to keep roof in
[48:12] plain view if not we get lost again and
[48:15] it's going to be trail of the serpent
[48:17] one two three and then we get lost amen
[48:20] do you remember the second banquet of
[48:22] esther look where we are
[48:25] in other words we're way down here and
[48:26] the second banquet is still up there so
[48:28] to go back up on the surface i have to
[48:30] wait for the signal from a gps amen i am
[48:33] not preaching today but i am translating
[48:36] brother polycarp he's going to be
[48:38] preaching it has been a long time since
[48:40] he preached and i will be translating
[48:42] him so lord's willing you peel you pull
[48:45] on the on the on the gift of god and the
[48:47] lord will speak to you tonight amen so
[48:50] without taking uh a lot of time because
[48:52] it's going to be him preaching and i'm
[48:54] translating so he needs a little bit
[48:56] more the time and more grace than us

[52:36] this place
[52:38] and you take a full pre-eminence
[52:42] take control of everything that will be
[52:44] happening
[52:46] may you take a control in everything

[54:39] [Music]
[54:49] genesis chapter one
[54:52] everybody can hear me
[54:56] genesis chapter one
[54:58] verse one to four
[55:02] uh
[55:05] in the beginning
[55:06] god created the heaven and earth
[55:09] and the earth
[55:14] and the earth was without form and void
[55:28] and the spirit of god moved upon the
[55:31] face of the waters
[55:47] and god divided the light from the
[55:49] darkness
[55:58] still in genesis chapter 1 drop to verse
[56:01] 10
[56:02] this adul's 10 to 12.
[56:08] and god
[56:09] called the dry land earth
[56:14] and the gathering together of the waters
[56:19] and god saw that it was good
[56:37] and god say let the earth bring forth
[56:40] grass
[56:41] the herb yielding seed and the fruit
[56:44] tree yielding fruit after his khan whose
[56:47] seed is in itself upon the earth and it
[56:50] was sold
[57:06] and the earth brought forth grass and
[57:08] herb yielding sealed after his kind and
[57:11] the tree yielding fruit
[57:13] whose seed was in itself after his khan
[57:16] and god saw that he was good
[57:20] amen amen
[57:26] if you notice the bible say that the
[57:28] earth was void and the earth was without
[57:31] form
[57:35] maybe in your life it's completely
[57:38] hopeless
[57:45] and i'm going to tell you tonight as the
[57:47] title of my subject my uh
[57:50] subject my sermon tonight do not lose
[57:54] hope
[57:58] when god created the heaven and the
[58:01] earth the bible says that the earth was
[58:05] void there was nothing no hope
[58:14] but after a while if you notice the
[58:16] scripture says that the lord begin to
[58:20] speak to the earth and the earth brought
[58:22] forth herbs and fruits
[58:29] maybe in your life you have something
[58:31] that is without form
[58:41] somebody already told you that you are
[58:44] doomed with the sickness you're gonna
[58:46] die
[59:11] according to science according to all
[59:13] evidences that human beings can produce
[59:35] whatever situation you're going through
[59:40] maybe it's difficult or not
[59:44] maybe trials or no trials
[59:49] just believe
[59:50] that god is able to change the situation
[59:56] god is able to change your situation
[1:00:03] behind every sort of attack from the
[1:00:06] work of darkness
[1:00:09] there is always a god's opportunity
[1:00:12] hidden
[1:00:41] i want you to look at that as an
[1:00:43] opportunity for you to go to a higher
[1:00:46] level
[1:00:50] and this is what we will be talking
[1:00:51] about tonight amenity
[1:01:04] there is a victory in the name of jesus
[1:01:06] christ
[1:01:07] the problem is
[1:01:23] their purpose is not just
[1:01:26] not to take the devil off your life
[1:01:32] but the purpose is to find out why is
[1:01:36] the enemy attacking me
[1:01:39] what did he see in my life to attack me
[1:01:42] at this time
[1:01:46] why it's so hard for me to get married
[1:01:52] why is it hard for me to conceive
[1:01:58] the purpose what is the devil seeing in
[1:02:00] my life
[1:02:05] why
[1:02:18] such a difficulties
[1:02:23] am i the only one that have to struggle
[1:02:25] to get married or everybody else go to
[1:02:27] the same trial
[1:02:30] behind every attack from the devil
[1:02:34] opportunity you must discover what is
[1:02:37] god's opportunity hidden behind this
[1:02:40] test
[1:02:43] opportunity
[1:02:45] so tonight we want to find out those
[1:02:48] opportunities from god
[1:02:51] when you're going through trouble in
[1:02:53] your life
[1:02:55] when you go into trials
[1:03:00] it doesn't mean that god have forsaken
[1:03:02] you
[1:03:06] we will notice what is the devil tactic
[1:03:13] you are not the first one to receive an
[1:03:15] attack from the united states
[1:03:17] and you're not gonna be the last one to
[1:03:19] be attacked by the devil
[1:03:23] what yes you spend if the devil is not
[1:03:26] after you so something is wrong with you
[1:03:28] secretary
[1:03:40] the bible says that trouble comes often
[1:03:44] to the justice
[1:03:46] league
[1:03:47] never the lord deliver him out of all
[1:03:50] his trouble
[1:03:56] let's go to the book of george's chapter
[1:03:58] 11.
[1:04:01] judges chapter 11
[1:04:08] first verse
[1:04:10] jeff day
[1:04:24] was a mighty man of valor
[1:04:27] and he was the son
[1:04:29] of a harlot
[1:04:31] and gillard begot jeffthal
[1:04:36] la fernandez
[1:04:52] and his wife's son grew up and they
[1:04:55] trust out jephthah and say unto him that
[1:04:58] shall not inherit in our father's house
[1:05:00] for thou art the son of a strange woman
[1:05:05] now listen carefully as we're moving on
[1:05:08] verse 3
[1:05:14] from his brethren
[1:05:16] and dwell in the land of torbjorn
[1:05:30] and went out with him
[1:05:33] and he came to the process
[1:05:38] it came to pass in the process of time
[1:05:40] that the children of ammon made war
[1:05:42] against israel
[1:05:46] israel and he was so that when the
[1:05:48] children of ammon made war against
[1:05:50] israel
[1:05:55] and the elders of gillard went to face
[1:05:57] jester out of the land of torbjorn
[1:06:09] and they say unto jephthah come and be
[1:06:12] our captain that we may fight with the
[1:06:14] children of emo now
[1:06:16] jeff
[1:06:30] out of my father's house
[1:06:36] why are you coming to me now when you
[1:06:39] are in distress
[1:06:42] listen carefully again
[1:07:11] did you hear
[1:07:12] that we are talking about opportunities
[1:07:16] tonight
[1:07:19] give me some time i'm gonna take off my
[1:07:21] coat
[1:07:54] if the devil
[1:08:04] if the holy ghost doesn't manifest
[1:08:06] itself through you second year completes
[1:08:09] the so you must be working for the work
[1:08:11] of darkness
[1:08:14] because at the beginning when god
[1:08:15] created heaven
[1:08:18] the earth was made it was void and
[1:08:21] without form may tell
[1:08:24] but despite that the spirit of the
[1:08:27] living god let's do that yesterday
[1:08:29] that was moving upon the face of the
[1:08:32] deep second year hallelujah
[1:08:36] so somewhere there was some hallelujah
[1:08:38] glory to god going on here
[1:08:41] so there were a different noise going on
[1:08:44] amen amen
[1:08:47] you cannot come in the church of the
[1:08:49] living god exactly
[1:09:00] i cannot be in the middle of a riot amen
[1:09:04] amen
[1:09:16] hallelujah hallelujah
[1:09:26] amen okay
[1:09:30] in the sermon the entire spirit
[1:09:36] 1955 july 24th paragraph 56. brother
[1:09:40] branham says this
[1:09:44] is
[1:09:56] i rather worship in a mission
[1:09:59] where it's been swept out
[1:10:01] or a bar room and have the freedom of
[1:10:05] the holy spirit
[1:10:10] and the love of god burning into the
[1:10:13] hearts
[1:10:14] plito
[1:10:19] then sit in the greatest cathedral that
[1:10:22] we got in the world
[1:10:29] and being cramped down with men's
[1:10:31] doctrines and dogmas
[1:10:37] we need today
[1:10:41] is a shaking revival
[1:10:46] get back to the truth
[1:10:49] get back to god's word again amen amen
[1:10:56] so you cannot be quiet in the house of
[1:10:58] god amen amen
[1:11:01] hallelujah
[1:11:03] okay jesus
[1:11:04] glory be to god
[1:11:10] we were reading the scripture in the
[1:11:12] story of jephthah
[1:11:17] the elder of gilad say down to him
[1:11:29] [Music]
[1:11:32] and fast again the children of ammon and
[1:11:34] be our head over all the inhabitants of
[1:11:37] gila
[1:11:38] me
[1:11:51] if you bring me home again to fight
[1:11:53] against the children of ammon
[1:11:58] and the lord deliver them before me
[1:12:02] shall i be your head
[1:12:34] and we will learn together
[1:12:39] i don't know who is going through this
[1:12:41] situation
[1:12:45] where we read satan afar
[1:12:47] doing a prostitute he was first of all a
[1:12:50] son of a harlot
[1:12:53] and his father was gillard amen
[1:12:59] maybe he was the elder son
[1:13:12] so his younger brother when they grew up
[1:13:14] lost
[1:13:16] when they grew up
[1:13:20] maybe their father passed away
[1:13:25] so they decided together
[1:13:28] that you jefta our elder brother
[1:13:32] you must leave her home
[1:13:36] you must leave this home
[1:13:39] amen amen
[1:13:43] elizabeth
[1:13:44] they say this verse 2.
[1:13:56] and his wife's son grew up
[1:14:13] from his brethren
[1:14:16] and dwell in the land of
[1:14:17] amen amen
[1:14:21] you know they are the country of taub in
[1:14:24] the scripture
[1:14:26] for jephthah satay elia the prisma it
[1:14:29] was a place
[1:14:31] for him to be broken down
[1:14:34] ellie
[1:14:37] it was a time that god was working on
[1:14:39] him
[1:15:22] oh
[1:15:59] [Music]
[1:16:05] something that's going to change my
[1:16:07] condition
[1:16:08] and then i'm going to have a better
[1:16:10] future
[1:16:13] i don't know if you find yourself in
[1:16:14] such a situation
[1:16:16] all may be a similar situation
[1:16:33] to a city called tober amen
[1:16:38] he was just like jacob
[1:16:42] you met the angel of the lord
[1:16:46] the angel of the lord you're not going
[1:16:47] to leave until you change your cover
[1:16:49] because i'm a liar
[1:16:53] because he was a shasta lady
[1:16:56] he said you must change me yes
[1:17:00] and now
[1:17:42] you must remember that there is always a
[1:17:45] hope
[1:17:46] yes
[1:17:47] because those that weighed upon the lord
[1:17:50] opportunity so there is all kind of
[1:17:53] opportunities this representative
[1:17:55] everything that comes in your sight
[1:17:58] you must seize the momentum
[1:18:01] you must change it to your benefit
[1:18:06] glory to god
[1:18:37] don't even have confidence in your
[1:18:39] husband amen
[1:18:43] no confidence
[1:18:46] you don't believe anything
[1:18:50] that was the same situation
[1:19:18] he was the elders of the city
[1:19:35] and those elders that came to seek after
[1:19:38] him
[1:19:39] they told him
[1:19:41] come and fight for us
[1:19:44] and then you're going to be our
[1:19:46] cameraman
[1:19:47] you will be our head
[1:19:48] country
[1:19:57] but if you become the head of elders
[1:20:00] gloria's here in glory to god the
[1:20:02] deviations
[1:20:04] you automatically are above the brother
[1:20:07] that trusts you
[1:20:09] because you are now ruling the health
[1:20:11] benefits
[1:20:12] because you are other men they all they
[1:20:15] are automatically
[1:20:25] because now his position is no more
[1:20:28] about his father house but the whole
[1:20:30] land
[1:20:43] instead of having a small person now he
[1:20:46] have the entire region together
[1:20:50] because the house of his father
[1:20:52] which seems to be a big inheritance now
[1:20:54] seems like a smile
[1:20:57] because he owned all killed
[1:21:40] maybe you also
[1:21:51] you would notice even if your family
[1:21:53] turned their back again
[1:22:14] [Applause]
[1:22:38] because they say that jephthah was

[1:33:26] question
[1:33:32] in paragraph 21. illegitimacy
[1:33:48] what is the place of our little tiny
[1:33:50] testimony

[1:33:55] at that day
[1:33:58] you see
[1:34:00] you see when we read here
[1:34:14] and then from there he went to a higher
[1:34:16] position
[1:34:19] and there are certain things if we have
[1:34:21] time we will see in the life of jesus
[1:34:24] and if you look at the life of david
[1:34:26] foreign
[1:34:54] these people never learn what you're
[1:34:56] learning now you know they put these
[1:34:58] examples

[1:35:13] was the spirit of god

[1:35:23] he even understood things
[1:35:38] maybe you would not have been born

[2:10:09] that belong to satan
[2:10:12] because he have a right to stand right
[2:10:14] there
[2:10:15] that's why we say whatever we preach in
[2:10:17] this church
[2:10:19] whether it's
[2:10:20] makeup it's hearing
[2:10:23] it's long nails or anything

[2:10:30] amen as long as you keep holding to
[2:10:33] those clothing you're holding to those
[2:10:35] things you're keeping those things in
[2:10:37] your life the devil have a right to
[2:10:39] stand beside you because he have what
[2:10:42] belongs to him
[2:10:44] the only one who was the much less
[2:10:47] sinless son of god was only jesus christ
[2:10:51] he's the one who doesn't have any
[2:10:52] garment but he took your garment amen
[2:10:56] upon him
[2:10:57] amen amen so that you might be the
[2:11:00] righteousness of god amen amen why you
[2:11:03] don't want to take away things off that
[2:11:05] don't belong to you matter of fact they
[2:11:07] don't even belongs to you you think they
[2:11:09] belongs to you they don't belong to you
[2:11:11] because they're not reflecting your
[2:11:13] father
[2:11:14] amen
[2:11:15] but it's hard
[2:11:17] that's why the bible says if you love
[2:11:19] the world
[2:11:20] and the
[2:11:22] things of the world
[2:11:24] it shows that the love of the father is
[2:11:26] water
[2:11:29] amen amen so you cannot climb higher
[2:11:33] with those kind of stuff the devil have
[2:11:36] claims the people don't understand i see
[2:11:38] still people with long nails and

[2:11:56] cigarettes but when he's in your house
[2:11:58] he starts destroying you so whatever you
[2:12:00] have in your life
[2:12:03] that belongs to satan
[2:12:05] no matter how much you love it
[2:12:08] take it off

[2:18:56] let's stand heavenly father
[2:18:59] lord we are approaching you again humbly
[2:19:01] tonight
[2:19:02] father thanking you for this message of
[2:19:04] encouragement to your children lord
[2:19:08] father we are living in the world
[2:19:10] where every day waking up
[2:19:13] we know that we're getting into a
[2:19:15] battlefield
[2:19:16] if it's not in the mind
[2:19:18] it might be somebody driving a wrong way
[2:19:22] it might be maybe something that
[2:19:24] happened
[2:19:25] maybe something that will upset us
[2:19:27] maybe the gas price went up again
[2:19:30] maybe something didn't go with the
[2:19:32] customer service maybe a delivery that
[2:19:35] we were waiting and then it was delay
[2:19:37] and then we get out of order then this
[2:19:39] is not working then the things we
[2:19:41] orchestrated are not the way
[2:19:43] father we thought it's going to happen
[2:19:44] every single day when we start going up
[2:19:48] we're waking up with a sword going to
[2:19:50] sleep with a sword but father we know
[2:19:53] that we are not alone in this battle
[2:19:55] father you are with us because you gave
[2:19:57] us a promise that you would never leave
[2:20:00] us no forsake us you will be with us all
[2:20:03] the way until we meet you into the air
[2:20:07] lord
[2:20:09] sometimes when we don't see things in
[2:20:11] the
[2:20:12] spiritual realm we don't realize how
[2:20:14] deadly this hour is
[2:20:18] if you would open our spiritual eyes
[2:20:21] we will be probably staying in our home
[2:20:24] and do not want to even come out
[2:20:26] because of the darkness of
[2:20:28] laodicea until father you declare it in
[2:20:31] the zodiac
[2:20:32] and you show it through your prophet
[2:20:35] that everything was dark spiritually no
[2:20:38] wonder paul was afraid from the first
[2:20:41] age
[2:20:42] he said i'm afraid
[2:20:44] as the serpent began evil
[2:20:47] father as a prophet he could see where
[2:20:50] the church would drift away
[2:20:52] and the circumstances that will happen
[2:20:54] to the church
[2:20:55] but father before those circumstances
[2:20:58] happen there are promises given also in
[2:21:01] the old testament that you will restore
[2:21:04] father whatever the devil will bring in
[2:21:06] our life and father whatever happened in
[2:21:09] our life
[2:21:10] whatever complexes the people have built
[2:21:13] because of lord the background of their
[2:21:15] family maybe they were born out of
[2:21:18] wedlock
[2:21:19] maybe they were born and they don't even
[2:21:22] know their father maybe they were
[2:21:24] rejected by their own family maybe they
[2:21:27] felt of uh
[2:21:29] uh uh they are battling uh a complex in
[2:21:32] their life
[2:21:33] because of the treatment that they
[2:21:35] receive since their childhood until they
[2:21:38] feel like they're worthless
[2:21:40] maybe the way the husband treated them
[2:21:43] over the year lord until they felt like
[2:21:46] the nothing
[2:21:47] maybe further the way the wife treated
[2:21:50] somebody until father they feel like
[2:21:52] they don't feel like they're a man
[2:21:54] father many kind of complexes
[2:21:57] many kind of past
[2:21:59] many kind of family trouble things that
[2:22:02] are hard to even even or father tell
[2:22:06] someone
[2:22:07] and we holding them as wounds
[2:22:10] over the years a scar
[2:22:12] that we can go around that we cannot
[2:22:15] make a decision without using them
[2:22:18] without filtering things through those
[2:22:20] car through those complexes and most of
[2:22:23] the time we come up with a wrong
[2:22:25] judgment because of the complexes that
[2:22:28] has been built all around us but further
[2:22:31] you can use a chapter
[2:22:33] in the scripture lord father you allow
[2:22:36] him to go through this trial through
[2:22:38] this kind of situation so that somebody
[2:22:41] down the road toward the end time will
[2:22:44] look at their life and compare their
[2:22:45] life and say that if jephthah could be
[2:22:48] used by god if jephthah could be put
[2:22:51] between among the heroes of faith then
[2:22:54] my life also there is a hope then i have
[2:22:57] a hope to approach the living god
[2:22:59] because what they did in the old
[2:23:01] testament was under the blood of bulls
[2:23:04] and goats but father we have a higher
[2:23:06] blood today that is speaking better
[2:23:09] things than the blood of evil a blood
[2:23:11] that can separate us that can remove all
[2:23:14] the past that can break every complex
[2:23:17] that can break every circle and show us
[2:23:20] that we don't even belong to the family
[2:23:22] that we were born under but we belongs
[2:23:25] to a heavenly father family and that
[2:23:28] family's name is the name of jesus
[2:23:30] christ and we came from the very mind of
[2:23:33] god and in the eyes of god we are
[2:23:35] sinless we are the virtuous blood of
[2:23:38] jesus christ without spot and without
[2:23:40] blemish that's the way we will see you
[2:23:43] and nobody will go in the rapture
[2:23:45] battling complex nobody will look at
[2:23:48] your face battling complex because the
[2:23:50] scriptures say as you are that's the way
[2:23:53] we will be when we will meet you because
[2:23:55] you were taken care of sending out this
[2:23:58] world further to transform our life
[2:24:01] so that lord we can be even worthy to
[2:24:04] touch the book of redemption and not
[2:24:06] only to touch the book of redemption but
[2:24:08] we can eat it up and nothing happened to
[2:24:11] us because you paid the penalty of sin
[2:24:14] and there is nothing all the ordinances
[2:24:17] that was against us father you bloated
[2:24:19] up completely at the cross and we can
[2:24:22] walk freely further chaining up knowing
[2:24:25] lord father that we are the children of
[2:24:27] the almighty god father we commit them
[2:24:30] unto the hand may you strengthen your
[2:24:31] manservant that you use tonight father
[2:24:34] may you protect us throughout the week
[2:24:36] lord and father continue to consecrate
[2:24:38] our life and prepare us if that terry to
[2:24:41] come so that lord father we can gather
[2:24:44] together around the reveal word of the
[2:24:46] hour and go in a in a in a in a position
[2:24:50] in a level more higher than what we was
[2:24:52] yesterday father we thank you and commit
[2:24:55] everything unto the hand in the name of
[2:24:57] jesus christ
[2:24:59] hallelujah go ahead what is it
[2:25:02] [Music]
[2:25:05] i'm pressing on
[2:25:08] [Music]
[2:25:14] [Music]
[2:25:18] every day
[2:25:21] still praying
[2:25:25] [Music]
[2:25:30] lord plunge my feet
[2:25:35] [Music]
[2:25:46] my
[2:25:48] [Music]
