we'll try to see what we can do by the grace of God brother Glenn brother uh Tony I believe I cover everything right praise God so let's go straight to our scripture and pick up where we left it has been almost 3 month going toward four month that we've been dealing with the subject like I say like Sunday God is using different angles to bring you the same Revelation so I believe the you already suak this pretty good so now we're going to enter into things that are deeper because we could not get you this if you give this quickly and somebody did it get the whatever we went through three month the first thing you're going to reject it because you will think we're worshiping am man amen so we have to clarify the third person of the Trinity very good amen amen uh this message we need to get into real business amen amen let's go to Psalm 82 5 attendant so prepare for takeoff my subject this morning in the wedding I met uh an invisible audience there the MC himself was an invisible audience at the end he said brother Steven I follow you I'm from Canada we on Joseph uh the five government of Joseph so I don't know how far you going to go I say I don't even know myself so he was so good he said at least I can see you and Shake Your Hand say oh it looks like everywhere I'm going there is an invisible audience somewhere but we praise God for it my subject this morning is our life journey through Joseph's fa garment part 49 and the theme that we will be dealing with I don't know what you did sister rof but return my uh volume where he was please what we will be dealing with will be Thrones I put that in plural thrs plural and the Mystery you should not be afraid from the word mystery now if you afraid you got a problem you got a problem with the entire message the mystery of incense and blood amen so follow me very carefully because I don't want to lose you we're going to dig into something amen let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we are approaching you again humbly this morning Father we thank you for your grace your love your mercy and for everything you have been doing for us father this is as far as I can do with the ability that you have given us but when it comes to preach to minister to your children to teach it doesn't take a human being it takes the Holy Spirit himself to come down and to be the one speaking and the one Hearing in the ears in the heart of your children so father may you move everything that is contrary to your divine nature away from this place may your blood protect us and may you give us a wonderful service may you keep our hearts centered together on the revealed word bless those that are here and those that are streaming and will stream later as we commit it all unto thy hand we thank you for your presence Lord in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen wonderful singing the songs are already a message been preached amen the Bible says in Psalm 82 we going toward four month with this scripture the Bible says in verse one God stand in the congregation of the mighty you understand this very well he God judges among the gods you might be seen thank you verse six I have said ye are Gods so we know who are those Gods now amen amen we don't have any more question with who is Gods now we know who are those Gods like my wife was telling somebody it's so simple a child of a dog is a dog that's it that's it a child of an elephant is an elephant a child of a goat is a goat child of God is who God any question ah I have said ye are gods and all of you all of you so no one should be in that congregation hesitating no sir and say maybe they're talking about this one and not me all of you and the word is coming to all of you this morning all of you are children of the most high but you shall die like men that's the human part and fall like one of the princess when we spoke in the message show us the father and he will satisfy us in paragraph 8187 We found out that brother brandham said that man was the third person of the Trinity you remember that a you remember that amen uh if you see somebody too quiet shake them Amen brother Bram says that man was the third person of the Trinity the Holy Spirit are we clear so we found out that God God himself have three offices there is an office that is called the father there is an office that is called the son and there is a third office that is the holy ghost or the Holy Spirit are we together the father is God above us that's right follow me carefully my friend it is God above above us yes amen amen but the son is no more God above us the son is God With Us amen it looks like God is getting close uhhuh he's moving from somewhere and he's getting closer uhhuh he's getting closer to men amen amen he was above men now he is with men Emmanuel God With Us not with the tree not with the goat but with man because man was made in the image and likeness and the like of who God so men look like God [Applause] Amen are we together so God With Us God With Us amen God With Us amen but the Holy Spirit it is not it is not different God it is the same God Amen amen the same God when he was Tabernacle in one person he became the son are we together now it was God With Us which who was the Lord Jesus Christ but the holy ghost or the holy spirit is no longer God above us oh god with us so God is no longer outside of us now it is God in us amen amen God in in who us who is US amen amen God was condescending God was coming down amen amen and his purpose was to get into men amen so now if you want to find God [Music] [Applause] [Music] over here you need to find God somewhere sometime he's on top of the mountain the mountain call S sometime he's in the Tabernacle you need to enter inside the Tabernacle to see the pillar of fire sometime he is on the burning bush are we together you need to go find the burning bush and find God you need to go to MB the Mountain of God to see God Amen but when God entered Jesus Christ heaven was empty are we together if you want to find God God was only in one place in other word Jesus Christ lock God I'm going so I told you this is getting deeper in other word Jesus restricted the movement of God God in Jesus could not go anywhere are we together are we together that's why that's why Jesus say the father is greater than me because the father is god without a veil so God can move anywhere but when God find a veil he's block if you want to move here the veil say go back inside if you want to go this way the veil say go back inside amen and Jesus said the father is greater than me in other word the father have more Liberty amen I don't know if you getting but when the father is confined in the son his Liberty is restricted he can only do what the son was programmed to do have I lost you it that's why Jesus say it is expedient for me to [Applause] go I hope you can chew this thing I hope you can chew this thing before Jesus Christ John the Baptist had the Holy Ghost yes sir and John the Baptist presented Jesus Christ but when John baptized Jesus Christ John lost his [Applause] GPS because in Jesus Christ was the fullness of the godhead how John now turn around and say go ask him is he the one that was supposed to come something happened to the eagle because all God was sacking into one man are we together amen are we together amen are we together amen and Jesus say it is expedient for me to go amen because I'm blocking God Amen as long as I'm here God cannot do anything amen are we together then when Jesus went he released God that's right that's right amen are we together amen when God want was released now God came down on the day of Pentecost and begin to chop himself are we together do you know what a badary fishing is those who took biology there are certain uh germs that multiply with our sex are we together so you will see one cell like this amen and after a while this cell will begin to constrict itself like this amen and then he will continue to work until they became two cells and the material that was here now it's distributed into am it's the same cell but multiply now are we together that's what God did on the day of Pentecost that's right are we together on the day of Pentecost God came down and divided himself amen according to the number of the people that were there that's right there were 120 people and God divided himself in 12 120 light and enter there are we together now God God is no longer in Jesus Christ God is in the man called the Brad amen God is now in his [Applause] church and the Church of God this is one person but this is many members are we together so this ministry here is the ministry of Jes Jesus himself sir sir this ministry here is not the ministry of the man Jesus Christ it is the ministry of me and you where God now is operating in me and you right are we together over here God was powerful over here God was powerful but over here God is more [Applause] [Music] powerful hallu are we together here there is no sin that's right over here there is no sin that's right but when sin is there it makes God more poent don't worry my friend the work that I do you shall do it even how greater any question any question so these offices brother Bram say it is not trigger it is one God who manifested in three different offices amen but where God goes God need to have a seat come on now brother come on now brother amen wherever God goes He need to have a seat come on brother amen he need to sit somewhere come on when God come to your house he need to sit somewhere amen amen and these offices contain the seats of God that's right that's right amen if you have a problem my friend you got to swallow this one brother Bram says in the message Revelation chapter 4 he said now the first Throne was where in heaven God us I told you amen the second which was the Judgment seat he said the second Throne was where in Christ amen right here amen amen there is a throne here follow me my friend there is a throne here we clear Amen brother Bram say the third Throne thank God I didn't preach the message I'm just repeating the message amen am brother Bram say the third Throne is way amen that's so when God is coming down he's looking for his throne in other word you were built as a throne that's exactly you are only lacking the King on the throne there it is are we together and the Holy Spirit bring the God on the [Applause] throne praise the Lord is it too strong if it's too strong we skipe are we together brother Bram said the third Throne is where amen tell your neighbor

the heart of man where did he come where did he come did he come in the heart of man when at the day of Pentecost when the Holy Ghost which is who God come where into the human heart is that right when we speak about Throne what is strong because when we say the father is strong what does he mean the Father Strong listen to brother branam brother branam says this he says now he sitting on the what his father's throne in another word he's setting in God's power Amen in what Spirit the throne is not a SE are we together amen the throne is a form it's a condition it is a form it is a condition the problem is we saw so many im images of Jehovah Witnesses and everybody an old man with a white beard sitting in heaven like this amen Jesus this Jesus was a human being but Jesus before was invisible are we together when he was invisible he was on the throne or the form of the father sir that's why Jesus say I came from God follow me carefully you know that amen go to John uh 13 I have not started preaching yet let's go to John 13 because these things need to be clear so we can remove a Pentecostal understanding in the message amen God is in thrown of my heart he doesn't mean your heart have a seat [Laughter] amen John 13 if you there you can say Amen verse three you there amen Jesus knowing that the who the father had given him all have given all things into his hand and that he was come from what God my question is he's coming from what God is God a place no is God a destination no God is a person sir how can you come from a person usually we say I'm coming from North Carolina it's a place but now Jesus is coming from a person from a person I come from God in other word Jesus was in God Amen are we together amen so God open up and release [Applause] Jesus is that complicated no sir this is God Amen you call him God inside God was Christ amen and Christ came out easy in the beginning was what word and the Word was with who God and the Word was who God so the word that was with God was God are we together and the Word was made flesh so the word came down and this God was Veil now in a human being are we together D is a problem my friend we clear amen and Jesus said I come from God Amen he was in God then he came down from God in other word he left follow me now the office or the form of God and he came down to become a human being and when he became a human being he took the T of a son because he was the father who sent him are we together amen God in human being is a son amen s o n is a son are we together and Jesus said I came from God are we together amen verse 13 he was come from God come out and what and went to what in other word the same way he came down he need to go back again to God follow me my friend go to John 16 Oh Glory to God John 16 verse 28 if you dare you can say amen amen John 162 8 he says I came forth do you see that amen from who the father now he's not saying God he's say the father I came forth so some something came out but we know the one who was coming out was even taking the one who was bringing him up you understand that right amen I came forth from the father we clear come on and I am come where into the world he became the son I leave the world are we together and I go to the what father in other word I was first the father now I became the son and I'm just getting ready to take my flight again and go back to the father like I used to be I don't know if you get me I came I was a father I came down I became a human being in this world and now I'm going to leave the world and I'm going back to my original form how did he go how did he went did he go back how let's go to the book of act chapter one you need to understand this before I drop what is coming up if you there you can say Amen amen am act 1 verse 2 until the day in which he Jesus was taken up after he through the Holy Ghost had given commandment to the Apostle whom he has chosen to whom also ye he showed himself a love we clear after his Passion by many infallible proof being seen of them how many days 40 days and speaking of things PR turning to the water the kingdom of God now jum to verse 9 the Bible say and when he had spoken Jesus finished to speak with them yes these things while they beheld they were looking at him he was taken up we clear now the man that they were seeing the man that they were with him every day he T them that I'm going to leave and I'm going to go back to the father if you notice he was not going back just to Heaven he was going to the father Jesus didn't say I'm going back to Heaven follow me my friend Jesus didn't say I Come From Heaven he say I'm coming from God and I'm going back to God he didn't say I'm going back to Heaven I am going back to God I came to from God and I'm in this word now I'm going to leave the world and I'm going to go back to the father now he's leaving the world and he's going back to the father not to heaven to the father follow me my friend the heaven is a location but the father is not a location the father is a person do you follow me amen ah he says this he says on verse n and when he had spoken these things while they beheld he was taken up and a cloud did what receive him out of their sight do you understand what I mean so God Jesus they saw Jesus rising up and suddenly a cloud because he was during the day came and wrapped Jesus follow me and when the cloud WAP Jesus Jesus disappear but we know that the cloud has a mystery when Moses met God he met him as a pillar of fire and that Pillar of Fire was talking are we together am now during the night that light was a pillar of fire because he gave also natural light are we together amen but during the day that light itself turned into a cloud so a cloud is the pillar of fire in the day version if I lost you raise your hand my friend I told you I'm taking you deeper my friend the cloud is the pillar of fire in the day version that's why this picture here because he was during the day he have to appear as a cloud insulting this picture is insulting God amen amen amen are we together amen are we together amen so because Jesus was going through in the day what happened a cloud came follow me and the cloud open up amen and Jesus got inside the cloud not in the heaven not in the sky there was a cloud that open up and Jesus got inside the cloud the way your movie shows you is Jesus is going passing the sky and everything that's movie this is not movie this is reality amen the movie they do they are they are making movie according to their understanding without Revelation the true meaning is when Jesus went up a cloud came and a cloud open up and Jesus enter into the cloud follow me it's like a magician trick and and the cloud closed do you follow me when the CL Clos Jesus disappear we clear now we clear now the Bible says in verse uh 10 and while they look steadfast toward what heaven not toward the cloud they were looking toward heaven but the cloud already took Jesus amen toward Heaven as he went up behold two men stood by them in a white appal which also said you men of Galilee why stand you doing what gazing up into heaven this same who Jesus which is taken up from you amen into heaven into what heaven the cloud took him and he disappear and the cloud now begin to drive toward Heaven are we together the cloud let me go easy way elementary way God send an airplane the airplane is the cloud because you need to understand this when I will get to the Rapture you will understand how the cloud are coming to pick us up then you understand what happened to the Rapture but I'm not going to get to that God sent an airplane a spaceship called the cloud amen so the cloud open up and Jesus enter in and they close and now the airplane is heading toward heaven but that airplane is a cloud which is also a pillar of fire in other word if you talk to that cloud that cloud will answer you that's right there is somebody inside the cloud in the Old Testament that cloud was talking and we didn't know who was there but Jesus in John in uh in act chapter one he's demonstrating to us that the one who was inside the pillar of Fire it was me the Jehovah of the Old [Music] Testament is Jesus of the New Testament the man that was talking to Moses inside the pillar of fire that was me to prove to you I'm entering inside and I close the door now I be I'm going back I am back to the Father the father was the pill of fire amen the father was the cloud am now I left the pillar of fire I became a human being I'm leaving the human being I'm going back again to become the pillar of fire again amen that's the reason why when he met Paul on the road to a he came again as a light and Paul ask the light who are you and the light repli I am not I am who Jesus he never say I am Jehovah because now the mystery is unfold he said now I am Jesus in other way the Jehovah the God of Moses the god of Abraham the God of all the Old Testament s now it's [Applause] [Music] me amen are we together amen are we together amen are we together amen take Hebrew one because I need to drive this thing deeper if I don't you won't get what is coming up let's go to Hebrew one I have not started the sermon yet so if your belly is small like this Deon are there they will stretch it up for you let's go to Hebrew one you there amen I know it's a lot of question is rising up we clear amen like I preach on a marriage I say something and the minister came after he say I did Stephen you say something you you you you lost to me I told my wife I said it's very important amen these things open up the pipe amen yes sir and when the pipe are open the rainbow TR to look sir say what is this I never heard something like this because I say I say the one who formed Man Out of the Dust was who God and the one who say it is not good for men to be alone was who how can God do something that was not good cite me with the scripture who said who form man alone why did he make men alone knowing that it's not good Hallelujah you see now now your pipe are open do you see now who says who made men alone who say it is not good for men to be alone God so why did God make something he knew he was not [Music] good keep that in a pocket let's move on with Hebrew are we together are we together open up the pipe my friend amen so the rainbow Tru can now say ah then we set for the catch amen amen in in Hebrew 1 verse 5 if you dare you can say amen amen for to which of the angel said he at any time you are what my son watch very carefully this this day I have done what begotten thee so God is is birthing his sonre amen our human being we're looking at somebody with a pregnancy and now when he birth the pregnancy is uh I mean it's a baby different than mama that's not in Godhead in Godhead when Mama give birth Mama become the baby mama disappear if you say where is Mama look at that baby that baby become mama in Godhead so when God give birth the think God is birthing become God himself in other word god birth something and get into that thing and the first form of God disappear that is the teaching of the God have the Bible say you are my son this day I have what begotten thee and again I will be to him I what a father and he shall be to me what a son and again when he brings the what in the first begotten into he's bringing who the first begotten he's bringing who Jesus read Bible he's bringing who the first begotten if you bringing the first come on brother the first begotten is he the last child when you say the first begotten it means what there are many more children that are coming amen you see now you see now if you have a child you would say I brought my child but if you say this is my first one it means there is another one and God saying the first begotten am so Jesus was the first born am so they must be other children but here are God and all of you are children of the most high are we together now are we together amen follow my friend he says when he bring the water the first begotten into the water the world he says and let all the angel of God do what worship Him how can God bring a baby to worship Him because God doesn't share his glory with no oneall but Isaiah say that baby a son is born he will be called what wonderful and what counselor and what and he will be called what Mighty God how can a child be called Mighty God he will be called Mighty God Everlasting father how can a child be a father and not only a father Everlasting father in other way that child is God himself so God changed formall are we together are we together amen are we together amen he says here verse uh seven and and of all the and of the Angel he says who make what his Angel Spirit uh-huh and his ministers a flame of fire watch verse uh eight but to who unto the son he sayth uh-huh this is where Catholic got trouble and as to the son he say your throne ah so the son have a throne you understand now your throne what oh god ah he's talking to who so how how is the son oh God look at that God is is capital G amen that son is God in capital G your throne oh who God Isel forever and ever a scepter of righteousness is the scepter of what thy kingdom watch my friend you have love what righteousness and hated what iniquity therefore God even your God has anointed you with all of gladness above who thy fellows if that above who thy fellows remember he's the first begotten but he got fellows he got brothers and God and God gave birth to God and that God that came out is the firstborn yes sir so they are the children that will come if the first is God those the other one that are coming there are who so those fellow [Applause] who you are what God he was just he is just anointed above us his anointing is greater than us but the material is everything the same we are as much God as Jesus was God I don't know if we together I don't know if we together are we together are we together now let's go back to the quote my friend brother Bram says in other word he's setting in what God's power in what in spirit but when he comes back he shall sit in an Earthly body on the throne of David now he's sitting in the Majesty of what father now when we say father it is who Jesus it is who the spirit of God by what the holy spirit in US [Music] he says now he is on the father what right hand of Majesty we use the body name I won't get to this my friend Jesus Christ who appear the Holy Spirit which is who God whatever you ask the father in my name that will I do for I and my father are what one now begin to swallow this my friend I don't have any choice now his body with n carar in it has not come back yet amen the God that was in Jesus the body it is sitting at the right hand of God see he's sitting on the father's throne but when he comes back at the Rapture he's going to set on his own Throne the Throne of David that he inherited that is when he comes in a physical form but he is here when now in a what spiritual form working through what your body and what my body that is him where now are we together are we together amen God is way in your body if you want to find God is where in my body don't worry my friend if you don't understand this thing you won't take control of stuff right you will go to Ohio and be like everybody but when I go to Ohio I

brother Bram say in the heart see it they just what mentally believe it and your mental will reason that's right could it be so could Divine Healing be so could the baptism of the Holy Ghost be so now

Jesus say if my kingdom was in this world I would have called a bunch of Angel Amen to intervene but my kingdom is not here then Jesus turn around he says the kingdom that I'm talking about that have

a soul shall sin through ignorance against any of The Commandments of the Lord concerning things which not to be done and shall do against any of them verse three if the priest that is Anointed do sin according to the sin of the people uhhuh then let him bring for his sin which he hath sinned a young bulock uhh without blemish unto the Lord for sin offering God good go ahead verse four and he shall bring the bulock the door of the Tabernacle of the congregation before the Lord uhhuh and shall lay his hand upon the Bullock's head uhhuh and kill the bulock before the Lord mhm and the priest that that is Anointed shall take of the Bullock's blood and bring it to the Tabernacle of the congregation yes sir and the priest shall dip his finger in the blood and sprinkle of the blood seven times before the Lord before the veil of the sanctuary and the and the priest shall put some of the blood upon the horns of the altar of sweet incense before the Lord go ahead which is in the Tabernacle of the congregation and shall pour all the blood of the bulock at the bottom of the altar of the burnt offering thank you very much so we found out when the sacrifice of sin which which was a young bulock or a cal was kill the blood was taken follow me my friend amen and the blood was placed in three places seven time he was sprinkle with a finger on the veil you know what it means then he was placed on the altar not on the upon the altar but upon the Horn of the Altar and then at the bottom we are still dealing with upon the Horn of the altar of incense amen now when we talked about this altar we found out that in the Old Testament the incense amen and prayer were parallel you remember this you remember this parallel in other words the incense was inside the Tabernacle and the Altar and the and the prayer was outside so one going one way the other one going one another way the only problem is they were going at the same time then David said that he want his prayer you remember last Sunday to be like incense are we together and we found out that the incense was placed upon the golden altar all the altar of incense and that altar have four HS everybody clear now according to what we saw we found out that that altar according to Exodus 30 was placed before Dev because of sin and after the death of Jesus Christ when Paul came According to Hebrew Paul took the Altar and pushed it there and he became a direct line to the throne right did you hear the song that was sing this morning in the Old Testament the veil divided the Tabernacle the altar was here and the Ark of the Covenant was there with two Carib beams and The Mercy Seat when the ve was divided Paul took this Altar and moving from the holy Place into the holiest amen now the altar became Before the Throne are we together so whatever prayer goes right here it is Before the Throne it's a direct line Before the Throne are we together and the O and the incense have to be burned in the morning every morning and every evening amen you remember that yes sir every morning and every evening and then he have to be uh the altar have to be consecrated once a year are we together now according to uh Revelation 9 remember that the atonement the blood was placed not on the altar but on the Horn of the altar yes sir and according to Revelation 9:13 the Bible say and the six Angels son and I Heard a Voice one voice not voices One Voice from the four horns of the water golden altar so the four horns speak together are we together and when they speak they create one voice and when they needed to consecrate the altar they put the blood on the horn and it's on the horn that The Voice is coming out am are we together so that alt that voice that is coming out because this is on Earth in heaven we didn't have Veil we went through that that's right according to heaven the Throne of God is here amen and the altar is Before the Throne this is in heaven yes this is on Earth are we together the altar is here and the and the throne is right there are we together now we found out that in heaven a voice came out from the horn yes but this altar is Before the Throne so God speaks amen are we together but the voice of God is echo through the altar if it's too strong you tell me are we together are we together the throne is there amen are we together the alter is right here God is talking but the voice doesn't come from the throne The Voice is coming through the Altar and it's coming from the horn so the altar become an echo of God so God Speak if you got connection with the altar you will hear what God is [Applause] talking are we together are we together if I lost you raise your hand let me start it again the altar was placed there and the and the throne was there there was a veil the veil was ripped and Paul took them and push it now if you see God before God God there is an altar and that altar they burn incense and they burn the prayer of the saint right there so every prayer is Before the Throne it's a direct line Before the Throne are we together now when God speak his voice doesn't come from the throne God speak but the voice goes through the altar amen and come out amen amen are we together so if that alt is found in you because the altar is the church you remember that we went through that the altar was the church number four on Earth so when God speak the voice of God is heard through the church amen amen where is Christ let's go back to the beginning where is God in you so if God is talking in heaven who will understand God Hall are we together are we together his voice will go through the church the church and he will speak so God voice become the church that's why brother brandham said the Brad the voice and the Brad and the prophet all of them will say the same [Music] thing please follow me carefully there is no age where God talk to the people about being their mouth are we together the Bible say in the age of laisha God say because you are need no heart I will do what out of what so the church is where the church is where and brother Bram say what he means is the church is the mouthpiece of God so when God speak you not going to hear God you need to find the altar amen of God and the altar will tell you what God is saying amen are we together amen whatever that alter bound Heaven also whatever the alter losing Heaven also loses so God and the altar became one are we together are you following me amen what is coming up is getting deeper again the Bible says why the pram says that When Jesus ascended on high he gave gift unto men there was a What atmosphere where hung over the Earth of what darkness and what Gloom and what death and what and weary and the prayer could not what come up because the atonement was not what made so the prayer were blocked that's why they have to put blood upon the altar of prayer so that the prayer can go through are we together now follow me my friend according to Revelation 5 we found out that when he had taken the book The Four beast and and 24 L they did what fell down before the land having every one of them what Harps and golden V full of what oders which is ancers which are what the prayers of saints so every one of these creature had ANC am we clear amen how many people do we have there 24 Elders there is 12 of them yes which is for Israel the patriarch are we together and there are 12 of them which are what disciples the disciple the Apostle the Apostle of Jesus Christ amen the Apostle of Jesus Christ and what else there four beasts and four beasts the Bible says that what that every one of them have what Harps which are what instruments no every one of them have harp and what golden VI golden V full of what odors which are what pairs of saints so every one of the 24 elders and every Beast have incense and those incense are prayer of the same so the 12 disciple or Apostle and the 12 patri were holding prayers of the saint one from the oldest are we together one from the New Testament and not only they but the four Beast also have also prayer of the S because the Beast were the anointing that were going through the edges but those anointing started in the Old [Music] Testament because Israel when Israel was camping Israel was camping according to the anointing Have I Lost somebody Israel was camping Israel have 12 tribes there were three tribes on the north three tribe on the south three tribe on the East and three tribe on the west they were camping based on the anointing the north one was Dan who was the eagle this one was Ruben he was the man theid one was Judah who was the lion and this one was Ephraim who was the ox are we together so the four anointing were F were were were accompanying the church and in the New Testament we went through that amen the first church ages and then the second and the third and then the O anointing we are in the eagle anointing are we together so the four anointing cover the church both Jews and gentille yes sir and all of them carries the prayer of the s follow me my friend we getting somewhere and the Bible says here and another angel came and did what stood at the altar having what a golden sensor and there was given unto him what much incense that he should offer it with the prayer of what All Saints upon the golden altar which is before the what Throne watch that Throne that altar is Before the Throne now according to Revelation 5 the incense is the prayer of the SA amen we clear on that one in other word the prayer the desire of David is already fulfilled the prayer of the saint are incense we clear amen but according to Revelation 8 there is another incense are we together that is given to be offered with the prayer of the saint oh the prayer of the saint is already incense are we together it seems like we got two incense are we together we got an incense this is where we get it we got the first incense and the second incense are we together the first incense are prayers amen of sent but the second incense it's a mystery and brother Bram say incense represent what you remember that incense represent what blood the blood amen now we got incense and incense put together follow me my friend put your seat belt the Bible says and the smoke of what incense which came with the what prayers of the Saints ascended up before God out of what the Angel's hand so now the blood and the prayer of the saint are mixed together are you following me are you following me and they are going before God we clear why the blood follow me my friend brother Bram say so will your prayer go where straight to its destination because it's offered in the what blood of Jesus Christ which does what cleanses you the same blood that is put on the veil is the same blood on the altar uh-huh so your prayer will go to the destination because it offer with what blood which is the incense there is not a sin or a spot on you nowhere that's right there can be as long as that Clorox which is the blood is between me and who God how is he going to see my sin how can he do it brother Bram says this he says it was a place where the blood was offered and without the shedding of blood there is no remission of what sin no promise of prayer being answered outside what the blood we clear now that's why brother Bram say the incense is the blood one more my friend brother Bram say in the fifth seal now the incense was what the odors other stuff that they burn which the Bible say was what the prayers of the Saints if there is no sacrifice on the altar then the prayer cannot be received it's only by what the blood on the sacrificial altar that let the prayer go through what to God now back up and follow me carefully the incense is blood the prayer of the scent is is incense so now God say take the blood and mix with prayer and then put it before the Altar and I will receive it follow me carefully what is prayer am what is prayer amen prayer are words F please I beg you sir follow me prayer are thoughts amen sir amen am which will become word do you follow me amen do you follow me amen and they are expressed [Music] silently or loudly let me start it again what is prayer prayer are thoughts or words that can be expressed silently or loudly silently like Jonah amen amen amen am are we together because the Bible say Jonah prayed and he prayed where in the belly how can you pray in the belly the Bible say they were I mean I mean what do you call weeds all over him brother Bram say everything that they were ate was there so if you open your mouth what happened so how was Jonah praying I'm going to get somewhere amen let's go to First Samuel I'm good on time you who are woring on time let's go to 1 Samuel 1 Samuel chapter 1 very easy my friend Lord help me 1 Samuel chapter 1 if you thereare you can say amen amen 1 Samuel chapter 1 jum to verse n you there amen let's go the Bible say so Hannah rose up after they had eaten in shallow and after they had drunk now Eli the priest sat uh upon a seat by the PO by a post of the Temple of the Lord you know the story about Hanah and she was in bitterness of soul and did what and prayed unto the Lord and did what and wept sore follow me carefully verse 11 and she vow a vow and say oh lord of host so Anna is talking right we need to see how she's praying but she's saying something he say oh lord of hosts continue my friend if thou will indeed look on the Affliction of thine handmade uh-huh and remember me uhhuh and not forget thine handmade uh-huh but will give unto thine handmade a Manchild uhhuh then I will give him unto the Lord all the days of his life and there shall no razor come up upon his head this is the content of the prayer of Hannah so the way we are reading now it looks like Anna was talking like oh Lord my God so everybody was there in the church understand that this woman is crying for a baby but we need to see how was Anna praying jum to verse 12 my friend and it came to pass that she continued praying before the Lord that what that Eli marked her mouth ah so as she's praying the pastor begin to look at the mouth why next verse now Hannah she spake in her heart ah so everything that me and you read was spoken where in her heart who heard it God nobody follow me my friend that's why the priest begin to look at the mouth so somebody was doing this am and the preach say what's going on over there but she's talking she's even crying follow me my friend amen she's talking and crying and Hannah spoke where in her heart so Hannah was speaking in the heart but not with the mouth amen and I hope we are together if you listen to the mouth zero that's right but she's talking it's a silent prayer right we clear now she spoke in her heart amen only her lip did what moved but her voice was not what heard are we clear now are we clear now therefore El thought she was what been drunken so somebody sitting and just doing this and the preach say ah this woman got some wine in the morning amen but down in her soul she was praying but nobody what heard that's why I say prayer got two form you following me it can be done silently in the heart or it can be done loudly like we do it in the church or when we want to appear like Pharisees are we together are we together oh god of Heaven everybody can hear you can also say oh but I already spoke but you don't understand remember the secret prayer have something I'm not going to get there yet are we together so prayer has two F what I'm trying to draw here is in prayer someone is talking this is what I'm trying to pull there prayer contain a voice are we together the Bible say the prayer of the saint were incense if you look it's incense but inside the ense there is a voice inside the ense there is a desire inside the incense there is a request so there are voices inside prayer are we together are we clear now now why do we mix blood with incense inside prayer we already seen that we got voices we got thoughts we got word what is in the blood we okay now we okay now there must be a reason why we taking the blood sir and mix it with prayer but we already understood that prayer got words it got voices but what is in the blood the Bible says in the Book of Job job say oh Earth cover not down my what and let my cry have what job is saying Earth the dirt don't cover my my blood because don't cover my blood and let my cry have what no place in other word the blood of job was talking follow me my friend we getting somewhere the blood of job was talking job say hey leave the blood open because there is something in that blood the blood is saying something if you got a problem brother Bram says this he said Paul tells us that the blood speaks we clear now we clear now your prayer contain voice The Blood also contain voice so the two voices need to meet before he goes before God yes sir are we together the voice in The Essence is your voice but the voice in the blood is the voice of the sacrifice oh the voice of the one to whom the blood belong to amen let me start it again your incense if we put a loud speaker it contain your voice and your tune but the blood contain life and the blood that we are sending our prayer with is the blood of Jesus Christ amen so the voice of Jesus Christ is inside the blood am so God is talking and you are talking and they take the two and they mix both of you together by you God am amen and Jesus also is God Amen Jesus prayer is always answer so when they take the voice of Jesus and mix it with your voice I hope we are getting somewhere let me let me started again if not I'll let you go home and we will pick this up again you God Jesus Is God Jesus is the first begotten you are the second or third or the 20 for the 2000 to begotten but you are still God hallelujah are we together your voice is known by God the voice of Jesus is also known by God Amen but Jesus prayer everything he speak is answered are we together so when your voice is going before God God say push the break take the voice of Jesus Christ and mix it [Applause] together I'm going to say this so you understand because some of you are not catching up or they are fool and then the food is peeling on the ground are we together the first born was Esau sir the second was Jacob under no circumstances could Jacob receive the birthright but Esau made a mistake and the birthright became Jacob but he was not known to the father are we together mama say I have a solution your brother your father is relying on the tou and God blinded him for a purpose so that he doesn't see who is [Music] coming if he sees it Jacob he won't bless him so God put him to sleep the eyes doesn't see so he begin to rely on the tat so mama say let me with the tou he took a kid a sacrifice a sacrifice a sacrifice of sin a kid was a sacrifice of sin and put it on [Music] [Applause] Jacob are we together are we together when Jacob is approaching now to get the blessing his voice hisence is recognized by Isaac Isaac said that is the voice of Jacob but let me touch you when he begin to touch he was the sacrifice and the sacrifice is what treble [Applause] ISAC I don't know if we together I don't know if you understanding me so when Jacob heard he say Isaac heard he said this is Jacob how quickly did you come with food he said no I'm is he said ah I know who is so is come come come closer let me feel you when he felt this he said oh that is like my son do you follow me he begin to pour the blessing in his mind he's blessing Esau but it's going to Jacob so when you take your prayer Hallelujah and you mix it with the blood your prayer goes to heaven god listen he said this is Brother CH but when God listen closer he said no that's Jesus that's me are we together are we together so God sent the blessing upon Jesus Christ but you are in Christ so you are receiving the blessing that is supposed to go to [Applause] Jesus amen flight attendant prepare for landing my friend brother Bram say the blood did what speaks anyone knows that the blood is actually itself he can speak it is what a chemistry is that right how many knows that congregation says what amen but how many knows that the blood speak if you want to put it down each way Genesis 4:10 God say what about your brother brother his BR does what cries from the earth against you his blood is what speaking Hallelujah why hallelujah amen in Hebrew 12: 24 and to who Jesus the who the mediator of what the New Covenant and the blood of what sprinkling remember the sprinkling that does what speaketh better things than that of Abel the blood of Jesus Christ speaks what better things he speaks what better things so when you take your prayer and the blood better things the blood speaks what better things I don't have many more time I could dig into this my friend listen he says now if you get that in what Genesis 4:10 then in Hebrew 12:24 start reading Hebrew 10:24 the blood of who Jesus that's what speaketh better things then what that of Abel what does he mean better thing let's get that and I'll let you go home see abble he was what a righteous man he did what he died he died how innocent was Jesus righteous amen did he die yes was he innocent yes but let's look at the two blood he says because he was in the way he was where in the way standing for what the real Revelation he had he SP he cried out the justice of what blood of Abel cried out against who Cain but the blood of who Jesus Christ not only cries out but he does what [Music] redeem are we together put your seat belt I'm heading to the airport amen he speak what better things he Mak you what Sons and Daughters he what hides you from the wrath of God see the blood of able could not hide a can but the blood of Jesus Christ does what so when you praying is cou with the blood the blood hide you and Jesus goes himself you didn't get me well when you take your prayer you put the blood of Jesus Christ the blood of Jesus Christ cover you so when God looks he see Jesus praying I'm going to get to that maybe next Sunday he doesn't see you he look he say oh Jesus is talking but it's not Jesus it is you don't worry my friend listen to brother Bram he says now we also found where in Hebrews what the 12th chapter and what 24th verse that the New Testament that the blood does what speaks better things the blood is what speaking then the blood has got a voice and the voice of the blood is what the word hallelujah that is what makes it what whether it's right or wrong the word is identified by the voice of what the blood the voice of the blood is what the Holy Ghost so when your prayer is going who is talking in your prayer the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost talking to the Holy Ghost sir yes sir brother Tony the Holy Ghost is talking to the Holy Ghost God is talking to God oh God you're God he does what brings life it is what life he brings what life to the word and does what and quickens it amen and what amen and what amen now get it really good now and we go home we look in Genesis 4 the voice of the blood abble cries out against who Kain we find in Hebrew 12 that the blood of Jesus Christ does what speaks better things the blood speaks how can the chemistry speak it is what the life that is where in the blood that does what the speaking the soul that was in can it was the soul of can so it's got to be the soul of Christ yes sir amen amen cried out against it was the life that was where in Christ that cry out for what better things than what any he does what it speaks he speak how loud it is who the Holy Spirit he speak how plain he tells us that the time is what here so the voice of Christ is plain and Loud MH but we need to know what does he speak William May Bram sure the blood God speak he speak what a better thing the Old Testament the blood spoke of what guilt in the New Testament it speaks of what redemption in the Old Testament he spoke about what death and sorrow in the New Testament he speak about what resurrection and life he speak about what healing he speak about what Joy he speak about what power he speak about what life he speak about what heaven so when you take your prayer you put it in the blood Joy Heaven life power everything power amen he says and the same blood that was shed upon the CR that called out after the dead brother and call after his brother that had what killed him the blood of Jesus Christ does what covers all of our sins and speak what peace and what resurrection and what power and what life and what healing and all the Redemptive blessing that the blood was shed for he speak for what US certainly the blood does what speak amen amen amen let's finish with this my friend brother Bram say when we pray we must have the token to present with what our prayers the ense the ense to present with what our prayers now don't fail to get that when you do what pray continue you must have the token to hold over your prayer if you are not keep your prayer till what the token comes no token because you are not what promised to receive it you got to have this toen first that is what the praying price the pray price your fa to believe it glory to God this is where we stop when we pray we must present what the token Lord I have obey you fully I have repented of my sin I feel that you have forgiven I have been baptized in the name of what Jesus Christ continue the holy spirit is upon me now I need a certain things for your glory Lord and I ask for it it is what mine now then there is what something anchors back here w w something comes it is what yours it is what oh then it's what all over it is what all over it is what settled I ask for it I ask for it I must amen amen amen I must what have it I want it For Your Glory well that's it then he just does what gives it to you then you know it is what yours that is the way it is our children so forth we apply what the blood and do what it what does he do then when we have can present the token with your prayer it shows that you have fully come to obedience with the whole word of God when you get the token it shows that you have obeyed what every word then you and the word are what one you are only asking for the thing that you are amen [Applause] amen from today When you pray amen remember the ense remember the blood take your prayer amen amen amen you say father I don't speak good I I miss something maybe I don't know how to express myself correctly the way I was supposed to amen because there is a mystery the Bible says in Roman 8 likewise the what the voice of the blood does what also help with our infirmities so when you praying the spirit enter the blood enter the voice of the blood enter for we know not what we should pray as we ought but the What Spirit itself the blood the blood itself do what maketh intercession for us with what groanings which what cannot be uttered and he that search the heart knows the mind of what the spirit because he does what maketh intercession for the saint according to what the will of God so when you are praying the Holy Ghost also enter are we together amen when you don't know how to pray the Holy Ghost is correcting your praying that's right yes yes yes that's what the Bible says and I'm going to show you next Sunday that the Holy Ghost also magnify your prayer so if you ask for 1,000 God give you 10,000 the Holy Ghost does that hallah don't worry see you next Sunday my friend are we together so when you praying you say I don't know how to speak well I don't know how to express well I did everything I can but maybe you will understand me when you begin to go like this that's right you take the blood blood and you put it when the blood comes the blood is a full coverage he brings every ingredient that your praying need you need power the blood locks they need life they even forget to ask for a good health the blood continue to put everything are we together even if you did something wrong the blood covers he say I know they didn't mean what they're trying to do they already asked forgiveness the blood cover that so that when he comes before God when God examine the prayer he said but this is Jesus Christ Jesus Christ prayer is always so your prayer must be this is the secret God bless you let's stand [Applause] go home my friend chew into this stuff amen there is a reason why we show you who you are so you understand who you are so when you are approaching God you need to first know who you are you are a fellow you are a God and now you are coming with the identity of the big brother amen like Jacob coming with the identity of the big brother amen The Voice remain the same but the touch is different your voice remain the same but once they take the blood and put it upon your prayer I will show you where brother brandham says that it is no more your prayer amen it's a different signal all together because the blood the spirit when he enter into your prayer it begin to correct the imperfection of prayer and the Bible say he Di does that according to the will of God in other words the Holy Ghost will know what the word says because sometime the Bible say we don't know what we need to ask the Holy Spirit knows for you to if you want this you should have asked God like this amen so the Holy Ghost goes to at right and put it in arite and at right turn around and say this is nothing but the truth and the god in William May Bram turn around he say who say something like ask what you want he was not brother Bram and he was God and [Music] God are we together God told Moses move our wipe Israel Moses turned around and they say before you kill Israel kill me God look he say Moses he said oh it's not Moses it's me it's myself talking to Moses huh I thought I thought this boy you going to be God you going to be God so he's not behaving like God he's calling Israel my people you kill them you kill me God say who Oh I thought I made a mistake I gave him the godhead Hall are we together are we together can you win God how can Jacob hold and win God who was winning God a human being it's God against God God r in with God and God finish he say you overcome congratulation you overcome me a overcoming God because when you get to the person with sin that's when God is powerful am remember who you are amen let's stop crying a little bit amen let's go boldly Before the Throne of God Amen and tell him he say hey I'm coming according to your word I'm using your blood my blood nothing HH your blood that is the perfect sacrifice that is the blood of the altar that's the one that open up the way because the blood will speak for you when you silent the blood speak when you don't know how to pray the blood speak when the word run out of your mouth the blood continue to speak Hallelujah the blood is making intercession in other word God is pleading like ahuh you need to understand him ah he suffered too much if you let him like this he's going to lose his mind at least give him that before you know tomorrow solution and do you hear those testimony brother I was be about to give up why do you say you were about to give up so why didn't you give up if you were about to give up because there was something blocking you can only go so far amen let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we are approaching you again humbly this evening this afternoon father we thank thee for your grace for your love for your mercy and for everything you have been doing for us father we spoke about the blood a direct land which is prayer Before the Throne of God Lord May our prayer this afternoon be mixed with your blood because the blood speak better things it speaks of power it speaks of healing it speaks of Resurrection it speaks of life it speaks of every Redemptive blessing that you died for on Calvary where we don't even know what to pray because of our limitation in this flesh because of the trouble and the trial we go through father your blood stepp in and Lord your spirit intercede and Lord father speak better things according to your word Lord I pray that where we stop may your spirit pick up in our prayer in our prayer for our families in our prayer for this church in our prayer for the Brad for for the blood of Jesus Christ in our prayer for our job for every aspect of our life may the blood permeate and speak better things Lord because you paid the price on Calvary and you did it for us we thank you and commit everything unto their hand the uncoming week unto their hand father protect us give us a good weather
