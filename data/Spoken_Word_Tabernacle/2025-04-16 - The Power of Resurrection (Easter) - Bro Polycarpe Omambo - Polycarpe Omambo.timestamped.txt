[0:00] I was married and we haven't seen each
[0:02] other for years. Her father was a very
[0:05] personal friend of mine. His name was
[0:08] Lee. Marian
[0:10] Lee. And I remember one night a
[0:12] scripture he couldn't he couldn't get it
[0:14] fixed up. He said, "Brother Brandom, I
[0:17] I'm not doubting you, but said, you
[0:19] know, I've always been taught this." He
[0:21] was a he was a Nazarene. And he said, "I
[0:24] I've been taught this, and I I just
[0:26] can't understand it." and he was a
[0:28] carpenter. I went home with him one
[0:31] night and he said, "Uh, I'll tell you
[0:34] while Norman then goes up stairs said,
[0:36] "Let's let's just have a bite to eat. We
[0:39] got some cornbreaded buttermilk. That's
[0:41] really good." And so we I could treat it
[0:45] justice right now. I haven't been eating
[0:46] for about three weeks here. Just a
[0:49] little now and then so I could be at the
[0:52] best for my Lord. And now we got a big
[0:56] glass of cold buttermilk out of the
[0:58] spring house and a big piece of cold
[0:59] cornbread and we sat down and crumbled
[1:01] this cornbread up in there was eating
[1:03] and he said, "Billy, I just don't get
[1:06] that what you're talking about." So we
[1:09] we went to bed long about long late in
[1:14] the night. He we talked to about 1:00
[1:17] and I went to sleep on him and he he he
[1:20] woke up and he said I I dreamed that I
[1:23] was building a building up in New Albany
[1:26] and the man left me the blueprint. He
[1:28] went to Florida and he had a on his
[1:31] blueprint he had a bay window and I said
[1:33] that man don't want that bay window out
[1:35] there. So I just left it off and said
[1:37] when the man come back he said I will
[1:39] not pay you for this building until you
[1:41] tear it down and rebuild it according to
[1:43] this blueprint. I said, "There's a creek
[1:46] right down here. It isn't very far. So,
[1:48] you don't want to go carrying something
[1:50] down at the end of the road. You might
[1:51] not have time." He said, "It's all right
[1:53] with my pajamas on." I said, "Mine, too.
[1:55] Let's go." So, we went down.
[1:59] So, his daughter got
[2:02] real
[2:04] real famous and his grandchildren on
[2:07] singing and they they were United
[2:09] Brethren. His daughter is married a
[2:12] United Brethren minister or minister's
[2:14] son. And this boy, fine fella, he was a
[2:20] machinist up the vote works. And the
[2:23] little girls trying to live for Christ.
[2:26] It got too much pressure on their very
[2:27] genius kitties. One of them at 17 years
[2:30] old was teaching music. She had majored
[2:33] in. She was a very smart girl. And so,
[2:37] uh, this little fella couldn't stand the
[2:39] pressure, be teased, and they tell her
[2:42] she was oldfashioned and so forth. And
[2:44] after a while, the kid had a breakdown.
[2:47] They they taken her to what they call
[2:49] our lady of peace, a Catholic
[2:50] institution in Louisville, for shock
[2:52] treatment. And they gave her, of course,
[2:54] that's a shot in the dark. If there's a
[2:56] doctor here, I hope I don't offend you
[2:57] by that, but sometimes it makes them
[2:59] worse than ever. And so, give her a
[3:02] shock treatment. And it made the child
[3:04] worse.
[3:05] So they sent her home few weeks had to
[3:08] bring her back again and she was really
[3:13] in her

[34:37] finished praying, I I had the the Bible
[34:40] just uh on my bed because I was kneeling
[34:42] close to my bed. When I finished
[34:44] praying, I opened the Bible. Um where I
[34:48] open the Bible, it was John, no, not
[34:51] John, Job. Job 14 where the Lord was uh
[34:55] kind of rebuking Job friends and the
[34:59] Lord the Lord restoring Job and at the

[35:22] who treat cancer. Another one. But I'm
[35:25] telling you, you're going to find

[35:34] explain, but I'm having this peace that
[35:36] I feel when God did something. I feel a
[35:38] certain piece that I cannot understand
[35:40] or explain. So they had an appointment.
[35:43] They took my dad to the next
[35:45] appointment. They put him under the uh
[35:48] the

[53:54] request

[54:01] Sister Divana, did you hear that song?
[54:04] Oh, praise God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.

[54:34] we are moving like Abraham,
[54:40] having nothing but keep moving by faith.
[54:43] And Jehovah Jara is supplying every step
[54:46] of the time. Sometime you want God to do
[54:49] everything in one shot. And he told
[54:51] Israel, do not destroy the promised land
[54:53] all in one shot. Go step by step so that
[54:57] the beast of the field don't multiply.
[55:00] So step by step we moving. Oh glory,
[55:04] glory, glory. Because everything has a
[55:06] purpose.
[55:09] Amen. Oh God, pray for me. Then then we
[55:12] can dig in that purpose a little bit
[55:14] more deeper.
[55:17] And then you'll be amazed that even
[55:19] whatever you do have a purpose.
[55:22] I even saw a quote, brother Brandham, up
[55:24] and I put it and I heard it. I say, "Oh
[55:26] my god, this one I want to bring it to
[55:28] the church." I say, May
[55:31] 10th. Brother Brandham, I meet the
[55:34] married couple meeting. I was like,
[55:35] "Wow." Oh, God. Brother Brandham says
[55:38] this say, "Okay, I keep it for the
[55:40] married couple meeting." Amen. Glory to
[55:43] God. I I can't take too too long. This
[55:45] atmosphere is so powerful. I just let
[55:48] the preacher move on. Brother Polycarp
[55:51] will be preaching and brother JM will be
[55:53] translating. So let's pull on the gift
[55:55] of the Lord and let the Lord speak
[55:56] tonight.
[55:58] Thank you
[56:00] Jesus. Yes sir.

[57:58] are glorious.
[58:01] [Music]
[58:06] You believe it this evening?
[58:12] Can we applaud for the Lord?
[58:19] If there is a time
[58:23] that the Christians may rejoice
[58:27] is this month,
[58:29] the month of April. Amen. Amen.
[58:35] It's the month that we celebrate the um

[59:00] He who was resurrected.
[59:05] The Bible declares he's the same
[59:06] yesterday, today, and forever.
[59:11] He who was dead and buried,
[59:16] but he came from the grave without help
[59:19] of a
[59:22] man. He's capable of giving life where
[59:25] there is
[59:27] death, your works that were
[59:30] dead, dead situations.
[59:34] He's capable this evening,
[59:38] not tomorrow, but he's capable this

[1:00:10] someone. Amen. Amen.
[1:00:14] Because if there's Ezekiel's this
[1:00:17] evening, the prophets
[1:00:20] talk that preachers in the New Testament
[1:00:23] are prophets. Amen. Amen.
[1:00:27] So, we're here to prophesy for you.
[1:00:32] to declare and reclaim.
[1:00:36] We're ambassadors of God. Amen. Amen.
[1:00:41] [Music]
[1:00:45] If Ezekiel could um prophesy on dry
[1:00:50] bones this evening, we could al we're
[1:00:53] also going to do it.
[1:00:55] May God bless you
[1:00:58] all and those that are listening to us
[1:01:00] online.
[1:01:02] We greet you all in the name of the Lord
[1:01:04] Jesus
[1:01:06] Christ. I believe the Lord God will not
[1:01:08] deceive
[1:01:10] you. A man can deceive you.
[1:01:14] You can even be deceived by yourself
[1:01:18] also. But when you're in face with the
[1:01:22] resurrection, you will not be deceived.

[1:02:41] Luke,
[1:02:43] it's Luke. It's Luke chapter 24
[1:02:46] verse 33.
[1:02:49] Okay.
[1:02:51] Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.
[1:02:56] Because I was supposed to also read in

[1:03:14] Luke
[1:03:16] 24:33. And they rose up the same hour
[1:03:19] and returned to Jerusalem and found the

[1:03:31] saying, "The Lord is risen indeed, and
[1:03:34] have appeared to Simon.
[1:03:47] And they told And they told what things

[1:04:25] appeared before them.
[1:04:30] [Music]
[1:04:31] He he himself
[1:04:34] stood in the midst of them.
[1:04:38] Because he wasn't a spirit. Amen. Amen.
[1:04:45] But they were
[1:04:47] but they were terrified and and afraid
[1:04:52] and supposed they suppose that they had
[1:04:54] seen a spirit.
[1:05:00] and supposed they had seen a spirit.
[1:05:05] Let us
[1:05:06] pray. Lord, heavenly
[1:05:09] father, yourself before you,
[1:05:11] Lord. We want you to remove us from the

[1:05:19] Lord that you
[1:05:22] yourself that you appear to the
[1:05:27] disciples and and you didn't limit
[1:05:29] yourself only to the Bible. But the
[1:05:31] Bible also say appear to many more than
[1:05:35] 500 each individual one of us to appear
[1:05:38] to us Lord Jesus Christ. Oh Lord God, we

[1:05:51] failed. There's someone that had failed
[1:05:54] in life and that needs you to give them
[1:05:58] life. Whatever condition that person may
[1:06:00] be,
[1:06:02] whatever situation that person may
[1:06:08] be, whatever situation that person may
[1:06:11] be, you're the same God this
[1:06:15] evening to change the
[1:06:17] situation, to change the
[1:06:19] system, to give life
[1:06:23] where death had entered,
[1:06:25] where there was
[1:06:27] um where there was sadness to give.
[1:06:30] Bless your people, Lord. They did not
[1:06:32] come over here to live, but they they
[1:06:35] came over here to the Lord Jesus Christ,
[1:06:38] the resurrected. Hallelujah.
[1:06:41] Hallelujah. May your name be praised.
[1:06:44] May your name be blessed. We want you to
[1:06:46] take
[1:06:47] control from the pulpit.
[1:06:51] May every spirit, may they be
[1:06:55] submit in the life of a person. May
[1:06:58] every spirit be submitted and all the
[1:07:01] glory return to you. May you manifest
[1:07:03] yourself, Lord.
[1:07:05] In the power of resurrection, for we ask
[1:07:09] in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen.
[1:07:12] You may be seated.
[1:07:15] I'm going to continue the the reading
[1:07:19] in verse 38.
[1:07:26] And he said unto them, "Why are ye
[1:07:29] troubled? And why do thoughts arise in
[1:07:32] your
[1:07:34] [Music]
[1:07:41] hearts?" Behold my hands and my feet
[1:07:45] that it is that it is I myself. Handle
[1:07:49] me and see. For his spirit have not
[1:07:52] flesh and bones as ye see me have.
[1:08:02] And when and when he had s spoken, he
[1:08:05] showed them his hands and his feet.
[1:08:12] [Music]
[1:08:18] And while they yet believed not for joy
[1:08:22] and wondered, he said unto them, "Have
[1:08:25] ye here any meat?"
[1:08:30] [Music]
[1:08:33] And they gave him a piece of bro fish
[1:08:36] and of a honeycomb.
[1:08:42] And he took it and did it before them.
[1:08:51] [Music]
[1:09:01] And he said unto them, "These are the
[1:09:04] words which I spake unto you while I was
[1:09:07] yet with you, that all things must be
[1:09:10] fulfilled, which were written in the law
[1:09:13] of Moses and in the prophets and in the
[1:09:16] Psalms concerning me." Amen.
[1:09:24] Then open he their understanding that
[1:09:27] they might understand the scriptures.
[1:09:34] I'll read something extremely quick in
[1:09:37] the book of Matthew
[1:09:42] chapter verse 27.
[1:09:45] Matthew chapter
[1:09:48] 27 verse 21 to 51 verse 51 to 52.
[1:09:58] [Music]
[1:10:05] And behold, the veil of the temple was
[1:10:07] ran entwined from the top to the bottom.
[1:10:10] And the earthquake and the rocks ran.
[1:10:19] [Music]
[1:10:26] And and and the graves were open and
[1:10:29] many bodies of the saints were slept
[1:10:32] arose which were slept arose.
[1:10:42] [Music]
[1:10:45] and came out of the graves after his
[1:10:47] resurrection and went into the holy city
[1:10:50] and appeared to unto many.
[1:11:00] And we just came from reading from verse
[1:11:03] two that the graves were open and many
[1:11:05] bodies of the saint which slept
[1:11:09] arose. It only takes a
[1:11:12] little it takes only a little bit of
[1:11:15] people among us or the people that are
[1:11:17] listening to us
[1:11:20] that you may have a certain problem in
[1:11:23] their life.
[1:11:24] or a certain situation in their
[1:11:27] life that was buried somewhere
[1:11:32] else. It doesn't matter what document
[1:11:34] was buried.
[1:11:37] We're in the
[1:11:39] season where the resurre the resurrected
[1:11:43] is
[1:11:44] here. He himself is the
[1:11:47] season. He changes the
[1:11:50] system. when he sees
[1:11:53] something, he's capable of even changing
[1:11:55] the system. Amen.
[1:11:59] Amen. So it doesn't matter what they
[1:12:02] buried already for
[1:12:05] you. Maybe cancer had buried your
[1:12:11] health. Maybe the the worm
[1:12:14] orale or female trouble had
[1:12:19] buried. Maybe the people of this world
[1:12:21] had buried your situations or your
[1:12:24] condition. This evening the person the
[1:12:27] resurrected the he who's called the
[1:12:31] resurrected he's capable of giving you
[1:12:35] life. Doesn't matter when those time
[1:12:38] took where we just came from
[1:12:42] reading. They said that many they say
[1:12:45] that many um body of the saints that
[1:12:48] were sleep
[1:12:53] Now think how many years that Abraham
[1:12:55] had passed
[1:12:57] away, Jacob,
[1:13:00] and Joseph,
[1:13:02] the prophets they've
[1:13:06] seen. When they saw it was their time to
[1:13:10] die, they remembered the
[1:13:14] promises. They said, "Promise me that
[1:13:17] you will not leave my bones here.
[1:13:20] because I have to partake in the
[1:13:22] resurrection
[1:13:25] because there's someone that's called
[1:13:27] the
[1:13:30] resurrection. So I cannot miss the
[1:13:34] resurrection and you this evening that's
[1:13:37] listen to
[1:13:38] me. I don't know which part of your body
[1:13:41] is
[1:13:42] dead. I don't know which domain in your
[1:13:45] life is dead.
[1:13:48] I don't know which condition that you
[1:13:49] find yourself in.
[1:13:52] I want to tell you this
[1:13:53] evening, he's the same God this
[1:13:56] evening that can give
[1:13:59] life. He can give you
[1:14:02] life. He can give you
[1:14:05] [Applause]
[1:14:07] hope because in him there's quickening
[1:14:10] power.
[1:14:12] He is capable to do all things.
[1:14:15] May God be praised.
[1:14:18] May God be worshiped. Amen.
[1:14:22] He is capable. He's able.
[1:14:25] He's able to change the situation.
[1:14:28] Hallelujah.
[1:14:32] We'll read something in the book of
[1:14:34] Romans.
[1:14:36] Glory to God.
[1:14:41] in Roman chapter 8 verse 11.
[1:14:48] If you're there, you can amen show a
[1:14:50] sign and say amen. Amen.
[1:14:54] May God be praised.
[1:14:57] It's written days.
[1:15:18] Amen. Romans 8 verse 11. But if the
[1:15:22] spirit of him that raised up Jesus from
[1:15:26] the dead dwell in you, he that raised up
[1:15:30] G he that raised up Christ from the dead
[1:15:33] shall also quicken your mortal bodies by
[1:15:36] his spirit that dwells in
[1:15:38] you. Amen.
[1:15:45] In Genesis 2:7, it says this.
[1:15:53] It says that, "And the Lord God formed
[1:15:56] men of the dust of the
[1:16:04] ground." And breathe into and breathe
[1:16:08] into his nostril. the breath of life and
[1:16:10] man became a living soul. That's right.
[1:16:13] Amen. Amen.
[1:16:17] And Roman told us that if the
[1:16:23] spirit of the person who resurrected
[1:16:25] Jesus from the
[1:16:27] dead, if that spirit dwell in you this
[1:16:31] evening, it doesn't
[1:16:34] matter which part of your body that has
[1:16:38] issues.
[1:16:40] You have to know first he's the creator.
[1:16:43] Amen. Amen.
[1:16:45] He is the creator.
[1:16:48] You reme you remember
[1:16:51] here based on science or chemistry or
[1:16:57] mechanics people that build
[1:17:01] vehicles. When a car is um broken,
[1:17:08] they know even the engine,
[1:17:14] they're capable of taking the piece and
[1:17:15] replacing it. That's right.
[1:17:19] How about your creator who
[1:17:22] resurrected for your body?
[1:17:26] It doesn't matter the situation.
[1:17:29] It doesn't matter the condition. That's
[1:17:32] right. Amen.
[1:17:35] I said in the
[1:17:38] beginning that we're like Ezekiel. Amen.
[1:17:42] Amen.
[1:17:44] We are we are the Ezekiel of this time.
[1:17:47] Amen. Amen.
[1:17:50] That we must
[1:17:52] prophesy. May God be worshiped.
[1:17:56] I want to read a bit of the prophet.
[1:17:58] Amen.
[1:18:03] [Music]
[1:18:07] No. Mhm.
[1:18:12] 27
[1:18:14] in 65. It is the rising of the
[1:18:25] sun.
[1:18:30] [Music]
[1:18:31] Amen. Amen.
[1:18:36] In 65, it is the rising of the sun.
[1:18:39] Paragraph 27. Now it is the greatest
[1:18:42] week in history, the greatest
[1:18:44] celebration of all times. This Easter is
[1:18:48] where he proved what he had said.
[1:18:53] That's right. Amen. Amen.
[1:18:57] [Music]
[1:19:08] men can say things, but yet it isn't
[1:19:11] exactly can be believed upon thoroughly
[1:19:16] throughout thoroughly until it until it
[1:19:19] is it until it's been proven to be the
[1:19:22] truth.
[1:19:24] Amen.
[1:19:40] and as and as God who said prove all
[1:19:43] things, hold fast to that which is good.
[1:19:46] He would not tell you to do something
[1:19:48] that he would not do himself.
[1:19:56] So he proved who this was that died for
[1:19:59] our sin. Amen.
[1:20:08] I want to
[1:20:13] put I want to take what the prophet said
[1:20:15] that God cannot give you to do something
[1:20:17] that he himself cannot do.
[1:20:22] You can remember the story of Abraham.
[1:20:27] God had told him, "Come out of your
[1:20:29] nation.
[1:20:31] Leave your family." Amen. Amen.
[1:20:37] And go to a nation that I will show
[1:20:39] you. And God had promised him
[1:20:44] had promised him a
[1:20:46] son. And not just a son,
[1:20:50] he promised him sons.
[1:20:53] Amen.
[1:20:55] And when God had made the promise,
[1:21:00] Abraham came to the ages of
[1:21:06] 90. And now God was obligated to fulfill
[1:21:09] his promise.
[1:21:12] And you will
[1:21:13] notice Abraham had Isaac.
[1:21:17] And when he had Isaac,
[1:21:21] Isaac's starting to grow.
[1:21:23] And as he's growing,
[1:21:28] God is asking for his only son that he
[1:21:30] promised him. Amen. Amen. Amen. Abraham
[1:21:35] and Abraham
[1:21:39] was in
[1:21:51] Abraham was in shock. He's saying, "How
[1:21:53] is God who promised me a son, who
[1:21:56] promised me many, is asking for the
[1:21:59] son?"
[1:22:04] And that same son, he's asking for it
[1:22:06] again. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:22:13] and God gives him his only
[1:22:16] son and reclaims that only son, the
[1:22:19] promised son.
[1:22:21] He said, "Go to the
[1:22:23] mountain and I will show
[1:22:26] you and you will give it to me as a
[1:22:28] sacrifice."
[1:22:34] In reality, Isaac became in
[1:22:39] plural. Abraham only saw Isaac.
[1:22:47] But God through Isaac saw many in Abra
[1:22:50] in compared to Abraham. Amen.
[1:22:54] Amen.
[1:22:56] Abraham Abraham could
[1:22:59] say, "You promised me many
[1:23:01] children, but you're giving me only one,
[1:23:05] and now you're asking for it again to
[1:23:07] give it to you as a sacrifice."
[1:23:10] What Abraham did not
[1:23:19] understand that the miracles of
[1:23:22] multiplication is is not resembling what
[1:23:25] appears to man. Amen. Amen.
[1:23:30] There's two
[1:23:31] aspect either.
[1:23:35] Either they take five bread, two fish
[1:23:39] and they multiply it.
[1:23:42] and that they feed a crowd. Amen. Amen.
[1:23:47] That is one way of God. And the second
[1:23:50] aspect,
[1:23:53] when we want to multiply
[1:23:55] something in the kingdom of God,
[1:24:00] we would kill something. Amen. Amen.
[1:24:06] It's it's in that mark that stuff are
[1:24:08] multiplied. Amen.
[1:24:12] John 12 verse 24 says
[1:24:17] this. Yes sir.
[1:24:31] Amen. John 12 verse 24 it says this
[1:24:36] verily verily I said unto you except a
[1:24:39] corn of wheat fall unto the ground and
[1:24:41] die it abideth alone but if it die and
[1:24:45] bringeth forth much fruit that's right
[1:24:51] amen it's the same thing among
[1:24:57] us there's dimensions of fruits that
[1:24:59] were produced
[1:25:03] Only when we're capable of accepting
[1:25:07] death to accept the
[1:25:11] sacrifice, there's a dimension of
[1:25:17] finance that you will not live without
[1:25:21] first killing
[1:25:23] day. There's a dimension of prosperity
[1:25:28] that you will not experience.
[1:25:31] when when you don't accept
[1:25:35] to kill what you have right now,
[1:25:42] there will be certain business that you
[1:25:44] will never
[1:25:49] start with without first taking the
[1:25:52] business that you currently have and
[1:25:54] putting it in the altar,
[1:25:57] the altar of God.
[1:26:00] of killing of a cornw wheat.
[1:26:04] The cornw wheat which falling onto the
[1:26:06] ground.
[1:26:10] You know you're u what you call deprived
[1:26:12] of eating this
[1:26:15] wheat and when you put it in the
[1:26:18] ground a tree will rise up
[1:26:21] and it will bring many
[1:26:23] fruit. But before it bears fruit, he has
[1:26:27] to first
[1:26:28] die. It's the same
[1:26:32] thing that today we don't have virtue.
[1:26:36] Why? Because we don't want to die in
[1:26:40] ourselves. We don't want to kill our own
[1:26:45] arrogance. We don't want to kill our own
[1:26:47] arrogance. Submit our own arrogance. We
[1:26:50] want to see ourel that we're above
[1:26:52] others.
[1:26:54] We want to see that we're capable by
[1:26:58] ourselves. That we can win. We can
[1:27:01] succeed without
[1:27:02] God. That we can move on by our own
[1:27:07] intelligence. That's our
[1:27:10] conceptions. We can
[1:27:13] win. That's what we'll see a little bit
[1:27:15] soon.
[1:27:18] But was also in Peter.
[1:27:22] Peter who was
[1:27:25] he was a
[1:27:26] doctor in fishing.
[1:27:30] You notice that
[1:27:35] Peter, he did not live far away from the
[1:27:38] river.
[1:27:41] That's where he had all his
[1:27:44] industries
[1:27:46] to explain to you that he was very well
[1:27:49] experienced in fishing in the situation
[1:27:52] of
[1:27:53] fishing. He knew the time and the
[1:27:57] season and he even went
[1:28:00] overnight. Just
[1:28:02] fishing, just
[1:28:05] fishing and he didn't catch anything.
[1:28:09] But when the day
[1:28:13] came, the story I believe it's in Luke
[1:28:16] chapter 5
[1:28:19] verse 1
[1:28:21] to5 verse 1-6 I
[1:28:28] believe I believe you know this story
[1:28:30] just to you know save
[1:28:32] time you want to read or to go
[1:28:36] on of what
[1:28:42] happened over there. They're telling us
[1:28:44] the story of
[1:28:47] he was a person who was very experienced
[1:28:53] fishing because because he he lived near
[1:28:57] the rivers. Amen. Amen.
[1:29:02] And that's where he did his work every
[1:29:04] day.
[1:29:08] That was even his his job.
[1:29:16] And that day he had fished all night
[1:29:20] and he didn't catch
[1:29:22] anything even his own
[1:29:25] sacrifice despite his
[1:29:28] um despite his diploma in fishing.
[1:29:35] [Music]
[1:29:39] You'll notice that Peter had the the
[1:29:42] string and the bow, the stick, the
[1:29:52] net. Have you ever noticed someone
[1:29:54] that's extremely intelligent? He has the
[1:29:56] diploma, but he has no work.
[1:30:01] Someone has experience of the worker,
[1:30:04] but someone that doesn't have
[1:30:06] experience, he's working and he has a
[1:30:08] place and he's
[1:30:10] moving. Have you ever
[1:30:13] noticed? Someone is extremely beautiful,
[1:30:16] but she's lacking even
[1:30:18] marriage. They have all the capacity
[1:30:22] that's required, but they're not chosen.
[1:30:25] [Applause]
[1:30:29] That's how Peter was. He had the
[1:30:30] diploma. He had the net. He had the
[1:30:33] degrees
[1:30:35] and he had the net. He had the string
[1:30:38] and the boat,
[1:30:40] but he did not have
[1:30:42] fish. May God be
[1:30:45] worthy. He
[1:30:49] failed. Someone can speak French very
[1:30:52] well. Someone can speak English very
[1:30:54] well.
[1:30:55] They can have a they can master a
[1:30:57] language
[1:30:59] but they're failing
[1:31:02] but they're failing
[1:31:04] with everything that they have. That's
[1:31:07] right. Amen.
[1:31:11] Failing is what? What do I mean by
[1:31:13] failing?
[1:31:17] It's not succeeding in the works.
[1:31:22] And the works can be multiple different
[1:31:24] type of
[1:31:25] works. Maybe you didn't succeed in
[1:31:27] marriage. Maybe you failed. Maybe you
[1:31:30] didn't succeed in school. You
[1:31:34] failed. Maybe you didn't succeed at
[1:31:36] work. You
[1:31:39] [Music]
[1:31:41] failed. Failing in your life, in
[1:31:43] marriage and all
[1:31:45] that. Even in the ministry, there are
[1:31:48] people that have failed in the ministry.
[1:31:51] There are people that started out
[1:31:53] right people that were even baptized by
[1:31:56] the
[1:31:58] prophet but towards the
[1:32:03] end but they left what gave the
[1:32:09] power. You will see a preacher behind
[1:32:12] the
[1:32:13] pulpit. You will see a interpreter
[1:32:17] behind the
[1:32:19] pulpit every day reading the scriptures
[1:32:22] and to interpret the word of
[1:32:25] God. But he's rejecting the thing that
[1:32:27] gives
[1:32:29] power. He can find himself in
[1:32:32] disorder. He can find himself in
[1:32:34] sin, in abominations.
[1:32:39] Why is that?
[1:32:42] is because they're rejecting, denying
[1:32:43] what gives power. Amen. Amen.
[1:32:50] Peter had the string, the net, and the
[1:32:52] bow and all that we spoke.
[1:32:55] But also he had the
[1:32:58] net came and
[1:33:01] did the um choosing.
[1:33:05] The Bible speaks to us that there was
[1:33:07] two two
[1:33:09] boat
[1:33:12] Our God is a God of choice. That's
[1:33:15] right. Amen. Amen.
[1:33:18] He chose the book of Peter.
[1:33:22] It's a God of choice. Amen. Amen.
[1:33:28] He chose
[1:33:30] Jacob and he hated Esau.
[1:33:34] It's a God of choice. Amen. Amen.
[1:33:39] And there's time, there's end time, he
[1:33:41] chose us.
[1:33:43] He chose you like his bride.
[1:33:46] [Music]
[1:33:49] He chose us so we can manifest him.
[1:33:52] Amen.
[1:33:54] And God did the choosing of the boat of
[1:33:57] Peter.
[1:34:00] He's a God of choosing.
[1:34:03] where people are crying,
[1:34:06] God will always make a
[1:34:10] choice. Even if you find yourself in a
[1:34:12] place where you're tight and everybody's
[1:34:16] crying, even if everyone else is sick
[1:34:20] with an illness and you yourself are
[1:34:22] inside that illness that will bring you
[1:34:24] to death, you have to know that God will
[1:34:27] make a choice to save you. Amen. Amen.
[1:34:33] even where they're rejecting
[1:34:35] people and you're bringing documents and
[1:34:38] they're rejecting.
[1:34:41] No, you had to know that God will make a
[1:34:43] choice and you're the choice of God.
[1:34:45] Amen. Amen.
[1:34:48] [Music]
[1:34:51] Just as he chose the boat of Peter,
[1:34:54] he will also choose you. That's right.
[1:35:00] The same Peter that had failed.
[1:35:03] [Music]
[1:35:07] God say take the net and move forward.
[1:35:13] Move forward into the deep.
[1:35:17] The problem with us is what?
[1:35:21] It's I am the problem.
[1:35:24] It's you who have the problem.
[1:35:27] But you will see you have a problem
[1:35:31] and you will take it superficial.
[1:35:34] You
[1:35:35] see, you have an issue.
[1:35:39] You don't want to go to the
[1:35:41] deep. You have to go to the deep with
[1:35:45] God. You have to take your problem and
[1:35:48] go to the deep. Amen. Amen.
[1:35:53] When you will go to the deep with
[1:35:55] God, the situation will change.
[1:36:01] Even if it was a problem of season or no
[1:36:03] season, the problem would change. Amen.
[1:36:07] Amen. The situation will
[1:36:10] change. May God be
[1:36:13] praised. The problem is we don't want to
[1:36:15] go to the
[1:36:17] deep, brother. When it's concerning your
[1:36:20] case, when it's concerning your
[1:36:25] situation, why don't you want to go to
[1:36:27] the deep with God?
[1:36:31] We'll see how he changed the system with
[1:36:35] Peter. Peter
[1:36:37] has fished all
[1:36:40] night. Why did Peter fish all
[1:36:44] night? Because at during the night, the
[1:36:47] water is cold.
[1:36:48] [Music]
[1:36:50] And he could easily catch
[1:36:53] fish based on his studies.
[1:37:01] But now there was a rising of the
[1:37:04] sun. He who is called light, the son of
[1:37:08] justice. Amen. Amen.
[1:37:12] He was there during the day
[1:37:15] and he told Peter
[1:37:20] I will not permit you to deviate or go
[1:37:23] elsewhere.
[1:37:27] Just the same net that you have,
[1:37:31] just in the waters that you were
[1:37:34] in, that's where you will throw your
[1:37:36] net.
[1:37:38] But the problem is this.
[1:37:42] I'm changing the
[1:37:44] system. Where Peter was uh
[1:37:47] fishing, it was where God told him to
[1:37:49] go.
[1:37:51] And God changed the system.
[1:37:54] And the system that God changed,
[1:37:57] he said go to the
[1:37:59] deep. All it takes that you have a
[1:38:03] condition that the condition that you
[1:38:05] find yourself
[1:38:07] in, everyone is in that same condition.
[1:38:11] But your God the resurrected this
[1:38:13] evening. He's the person that changes
[1:38:15] the system. It doesn't matter what
[1:38:18] condition that you have. He will change
[1:38:20] the situation.
[1:38:22] He changes the system so you can be
[1:38:26] reconed. So you can come out of that
[1:38:31] situation. There was a s there was two
[1:38:33] two sinner at the cross. He saved
[1:38:37] one who didn't even fasting who didn't
[1:38:41] even
[1:38:42] pray. Meaning he changes the system and
[1:38:46] this evening he's capable.
[1:38:50] If God had appeared to
[1:38:53] you where he appeared to the
[1:38:56] disciples, it was because he was working
[1:38:58] with the disciples.
[1:39:02] But let's let me tell you, he also
[1:39:04] appeared to the
[1:39:06] woman and the Bible declares
[1:39:10] that he appeared also to many more
[1:39:14] resurrection. Meaning after the
[1:39:15] resurrection,
[1:39:17] Jesus appeared to
[1:39:19] many. And that same God is here this
[1:39:23] evening. He's here appearing to you.
[1:39:27] We read
[1:39:30] he said
[1:39:32] the spirit
[1:39:34] doesn't have flesh.
[1:39:36] Amen.
[1:39:38] It's me.
[1:39:41] It's what we just came from reading in
[1:39:43] Luke. Amen. Amen.
[1:39:48] Because the disciples or many people
[1:39:49] could
[1:39:52] say that he appeared that it was in a
[1:39:55] vision or maybe was at a dream.
[1:40:00] Now Jesus did not want people to say
[1:40:02] vision or dream. So he appeared in
[1:40:05] reality.
[1:40:08] He is capable this evening.
[1:40:12] If there's souls in your life,
[1:40:17] God is capable to appear to them,
[1:40:21] to appear to your
[1:40:22] enemies. He's
[1:40:25] capable to appear to your
[1:40:29] enemies to stop them to do from doing
[1:40:32] any type of um ill evilness towards
[1:40:37] you. You will remember
[1:40:41] the story of of
[1:40:43] Aimilec. He took the wife of the
[1:40:49] prophet. Curse be to he that takes the
[1:40:52] wife of the servant of
[1:40:53] God. Then curse be to you to whoever you
[1:40:57] are. The God who is lifted the most
[1:41:00] high. He said to whom who touches you?
[1:41:04] Touches even the the
[1:41:07] the apple of my eye.
[1:41:10] Look at
[1:41:13] something. Aimilec took Sarah Abraham,
[1:41:17] the wife of Abraham,
[1:41:21] and God appeared to Aimilec,
[1:41:24] who was a heathen king.
[1:41:28] My brothers, my
[1:41:30] sisters, Aimilec did not
[1:41:34] fast. He did not he did not um
[1:41:38] watch for God to appear to
[1:41:41] him. But how you who have the Holy
[1:41:45] Ghost, God cannot appear to
[1:41:48] you starting from this
[1:41:50] evening, you who have the Holy Ghost,
[1:41:53] the Holy Ghost is the sp is the power of
[1:41:56] the
[1:41:57] resurrection. Let the God who
[1:42:00] appears, the Holy
[1:42:03] Ghost, there's nothing that can stop you
[1:42:06] once you have the Holy Ghost.
[1:42:09] even our our
[1:42:11] our steps to come to
[1:42:15] church. All the teachings that the
[1:42:18] pastor is teaching here, we're bringing
[1:42:20] the word of God from A to
[1:42:24] Z. The go so you can have the Holy
[1:42:27] Ghost, the baptism of the Holy
[1:42:31] Ghost, so you can identify yourself with
[1:42:34] Jesus. Amen.
[1:42:37] I read something
[1:42:39] here. I read the prophet
[1:42:42] also the prophet has said God cannot ask
[1:42:47] you something that even he himself
[1:42:50] cannot do. He did to
[1:42:53] Abraham. They he asked for the only son
[1:42:56] that he had
[1:42:58] to give it unto him as a sacrifice.
[1:43:01] And he was
[1:43:02] Isaac. And from Isaac,
[1:43:06] Abraham had many more,
[1:43:10] even us all by faith. That's right.
[1:43:12] Amen.
[1:43:14] But you will notice,
[1:43:17] God also
[1:43:21] had his only begotten son
[1:43:25] from his from his bosom. Amen. Amen.
[1:43:30] Amen.
[1:43:31] And he was asking
[1:43:35] himself, "How can I also come to
[1:43:38] multiply
[1:43:40] to have many children like Abraham?"
[1:43:45] God was in the impossibility,
[1:43:51] but he found himself in a
[1:43:54] possibility. And the possibility
[1:43:59] was he had to do it like he did with
[1:44:01] Abraham.
[1:44:04] Abraham who was ready to sacrifice his
[1:44:07] son.
[1:44:09] God also had to be capable and ready to
[1:44:11] sacrifice his son. And how can he do
[1:44:16] it? He sent his son far from him. He
[1:44:20] sent him on the earth.
[1:44:23] It was the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
[1:44:25] Amen.
[1:44:27] And in the Lord Jesus Christ,
[1:44:30] he had the body. He had the spirit.
[1:44:34] He had the soul. Amen. Amen.
[1:44:39] But they were children of
[1:44:40] God who was in
[1:44:43] sin who had
[1:44:46] fallen. But there was nobody that could
[1:44:48] save them from the fall.
[1:44:51] So God came with a
[1:44:53] solution when he had sent his
[1:44:56] son to the
[1:45:00] earth so he can die for those people.
[1:45:06] But who died at the
[1:45:09] cross? It was the son of Mary.
[1:45:13] It was not the son of God. Okay. Okay.
[1:45:18] It was the son of Mary. Who was the son
[1:45:20] of Mary? It was the flesh.
[1:45:24] It was the flesh.
[1:45:26] But the son of God,
[1:45:29] Solomon called him wisdom.
[1:45:33] Because he was extremely
[1:45:35] wise. He looked in his
[1:45:38] jeans. He said,
[1:45:41] "Father, I'm giving my spirit unto your
[1:45:45] hand."
[1:45:46] Because the spirit cannot die.
[1:45:49] He knew where he's going to
[1:45:52] go because the soul had to go in those
[1:45:55] days in the hell. And the life is in the
[1:46:00] blood.
[1:46:03] The soul that sin is the soul that dies.
[1:46:07] And when we're going to come to kill
[1:46:10] Jesus. Amen.
[1:46:14] The spirit is not there. He gave the
[1:46:17] spirit to the father.
[1:46:19] Because the spirit has a mission.
[1:46:22] Because the spirit is the one that's
[1:46:24] going to come
[1:46:25] down without a a without a help of a man
[1:46:30] to bring him out. Amen.
[1:46:34] And then he was at the cross and then he
[1:46:37] died and they took his body. His body
[1:46:41] was in the
[1:46:42] grave. But his soul went down to
[1:46:45] paradise.
[1:46:48] He went and it was in hell
[1:46:51] that he could even preach to the souls
[1:46:53] in prison that he could even take the
[1:46:56] keys. Amen. Amen.
[1:46:59] That he could even free those that the
[1:47:02] devil had imprisonated over there.
[1:47:08] And the spirit was close to the father.
[1:47:11] And the spirit had said,
[1:47:14] "Father, my place is not here. I had to
[1:47:18] go down
[1:47:22] expediently." The first day came, the
[1:47:24] second day passed. The third day, he
[1:47:28] said, "I had to go down."
[1:47:31] It's like,
[1:47:33] it's like
[1:47:34] Reuben who told to Jacob, who told
[1:47:37] Jacob,
[1:47:39] if you do not send Benjamin to Egypt,
[1:47:45] you have to know that we will not
[1:47:47] return, we will stay over there. It's
[1:47:50] the same thing. The Holy Ghost,
[1:47:53] I had to come down so I could take the
[1:47:57] body, so I could take everything that's
[1:47:59] over there. Amen. Amen.
[1:48:03] Like I was telling
[1:48:04] you, God cannot ask you to do something
[1:48:08] that he himself is incapable of doing.
[1:48:11] He asked Abraham a son and he gave his
[1:48:15] son. And when his son had um went to
[1:48:19] hell, the Holy Spirit also went down and
[1:48:23] brought back Jesus. You will
[1:48:27] notice the fall of
[1:48:31] Jesus. It was not the angels that moved
[1:48:34] the
[1:48:36] stone. No, no. It was for Jesus to come
[1:48:38] out of the grave. He did not need for
[1:48:41] someone to remove the stone. You will
[1:48:43] notice
[1:48:46] When the disciples were closed,
[1:48:49] he were entering without opening the
[1:48:52] stone after the resurrection, he could
[1:48:55] have entered anywhere. Amen.
[1:48:59] Amen. He did not
[1:49:01] need the
[1:49:05] hol the holy go the holy spirit did not
[1:49:09] um move the stone did not roll the
[1:49:12] stone. And there's not an angel that
[1:49:15] could come to save the Lord Jesus
[1:49:17] Christ. Why? Because he's God. The Holy
[1:49:20] Ghost himself talk upon him to death.
[1:49:23] The Holy Ghost did not roll the
[1:49:27] stone. If the
[1:49:31] angel had rolled the stone,
[1:49:35] it was to show to the
[1:49:37] woman that the person that you're
[1:49:39] looking for is not in the grave. Amen.
[1:49:42] Amen.
[1:49:44] He's not in the grave.
[1:49:48] If the angel roll the stone, it's for
[1:49:51] you and for me. It's so we can see that
[1:49:55] this the the grave is extremely empty.
[1:49:59] Amen. It's because of you and because of
[1:50:01] me that the angel had to re roll the
[1:50:05] stone. But Jesus had already came out.
[1:50:09] Amen.
[1:50:11] That's why the grave was empty. This
[1:50:14] grave that was empty, my brother, my
[1:50:18] sister, I don't know your issue that
[1:50:21] they might that they put in the grave.
[1:50:24] Your health is in the
[1:50:26] grave. Your situation is in the grave.
[1:50:29] Your intelligence is in the grave. It is
[1:50:32] not working. Your body is not
[1:50:35] working. Your work is not working. Your
[1:50:37] job is not working. Wherever you put
[1:50:41] your
[1:50:44] stuff, there's bad people. Wherever
[1:50:46] you're putting your stuff, they're
[1:50:48] putting it in the
[1:50:51] grave. The Bible says if the spirit that
[1:50:56] quickened, it was not the angel that
[1:50:59] rose the stone. It was the spirit.
[1:51:02] The Bible says
[1:51:07] that the first Adam,
[1:51:13] it was a living soul.
[1:51:18] But the last Adam who is Jesus Christ is
[1:51:21] not a living soul. No, no, no. It's a
[1:51:25] spirit that that
[1:51:27] quickens. A spirit that
[1:51:30] quickens. If this spirit that quickens
[1:51:32] is in you, it will quicken your mortal
[1:51:35] body. It will quicken everything that's
[1:51:38] within you. And this
[1:51:40] evening like we are in the
[1:51:42] season that our Lord savior was
[1:51:47] dead. Give me a sec. Let's read the
[1:51:49] prophet.
[1:51:52] We're here this evening
[1:51:54] in the
[1:51:56] season where our Lord Jesus
[1:52:00] is
[1:52:02] resurrected where the grave is empty.
[1:52:05] He's capable right now to give
[1:52:09] life in your
[1:52:12] ministry. He's capable to give life to
[1:52:15] everything that was dead in your
[1:52:17] life. He's capable to give life to
[1:52:22] resurrect the relationship that were
[1:52:25] dead in your
[1:52:28] life. The situation that were
[1:52:33] perished, your work that are not
[1:52:35] working, that failing, he is capable.
[1:52:40] Even your
[1:52:42] reputation that's probably
[1:52:44] destroyed. He is capable to restart that
[1:52:48] this evening. He is capable.
[1:52:50] It doesn't matter your condition.
[1:52:54] We also
[1:52:57] say that we are the Ezekiel of this
[1:53:00] time, this end time. Amen. Amen.
[1:53:06] May God be worshiped.
[1:53:10] in 1
[1:53:12] Corinthian
[1:53:14] 40 40
[1:53:24] [Music]
[1:53:26] in 1 Corinthians chapter
[1:53:34] 15 verse 45 44 4
[1:53:44] 1 Corinthians chapter 15 verse 44.
[1:53:52] I want to read something.
[1:54:00] [Music]
[1:54:06] Paul say he was a quickening spirit but
[1:54:10] for Adam he was a living soul.
[1:54:16] 1 Corinthians
[1:54:20] chapter 15
[1:54:23] verse 45.
[1:54:32] You see what is written here that our
[1:54:34] Lord. Okay.
[1:54:37] Amen.
[1:54:47] And so it is written, the first man,
[1:54:50] Adam, was a living soul.
[1:54:58] The last Adam was made a quickening
[1:55:01] spirit.
[1:55:03] Amen. Amen.
[1:55:06] That's what we just came from reading
[1:55:07] here.
[1:55:13] That's why Jesus had said in your hands
[1:55:15] I am giving my
[1:55:17] spirit because the spirit could not die.
[1:55:20] He was God.
[1:55:22] He was the
[1:55:25] creator. And if that spirit that has
[1:55:27] that had resurrected
[1:55:30] Christ is in you this
[1:55:32] evening, it doesn't matter your
[1:55:34] condition.
[1:55:36] There's not enough power in hell that
[1:55:39] can stop
[1:55:41] you that can hold
[1:55:43] you in the prisons of this world in the
[1:55:47] stuff of this world. In the desires of
[1:55:50] this world in the desire that are
[1:55:53] eternal, there's nothing that can hold
[1:55:55] you because he is capable. In the same
[1:55:59] way that he resurrected Christ, he can
[1:56:02] also resurrect you.
[1:56:05] Amen.
[1:56:07] Christ is
[1:56:09] capable to
[1:56:12] give you your life. Amen.
[1:56:20] The child of Mary, he was a living, he
[1:56:23] was flesh, like I said, but the son of
[1:56:24] God,
[1:56:27] he was the the quickening spirit. Amen.
[1:56:30] Amen.
[1:56:32] It's what we just came from reading.
[1:56:35] resurrection. After the resurrection,
[1:56:38] we will not be the same.
[1:56:42] There will be a difference, my brother.
[1:56:44] Even like we're here in this in this
[1:56:47] place after the resurrection, we will
[1:56:49] not be the
[1:56:51] same. We will have a
[1:56:53] difference. Even amongst the storms,
[1:56:56] they're not the
[1:56:58] same. There there are stars that that
[1:57:01] shine that gives a lot of light. And
[1:57:03] there's they're the same thing here in
[1:57:05] person.
[1:57:07] If you want to read it, we we can read
[1:57:10] it.
[1:57:38] 1 Corinthians 15:4. There are also
[1:57:41] celestial bodies and bodies
[1:57:44] terrestrial. But the glory of the
[1:57:46] celestial one and the glory of the
[1:57:49] terrestrial one is another.
[1:58:10] there. There is one there is one glory
[1:58:14] of the sun and another glory of the moon
[1:58:17] and another glory of the stars. For for
[1:58:20] one star
[1:58:23] difference different different from
[1:58:25] another star in glory. That's right.
[1:58:28] That's right.
[1:58:33] [Music]
[1:58:38] Different in glory.
[1:58:41] Okay.
[1:58:54] So also is the resurrection of the dead.
[1:58:57] It is sown in the corruption. It is
[1:58:59] raised in the
[1:59:03] incorruption. Why is there a difference
[1:59:05] in
[1:59:07] that? Yes, there must be a
[1:59:10] difference. Yes, all of us come to
[1:59:13] church.
[1:59:17] But is are each individual one of us
[1:59:20] taking the same thing with the same
[1:59:22] seriousness?
[1:59:25] That's why there's a difference.
[1:59:29] There's those that give themselves into
[1:59:31] the word of God and there's those that
[1:59:33] give themselves to the works of God and
[1:59:35] there's those that don't give themselves
[1:59:37] to the works of God. There's those that
[1:59:39] are dead
[1:59:42] that um
[1:59:45] [Music]
[1:59:46] that brought their flesh into
[1:59:50] subjuction that I cannot
[1:59:53] [Music]
[1:59:54] um I cannot dirty
[1:59:57] myself. I have
[2:00:00] errors. I cannot touch the
[2:00:07] blood. I cannot bring my body to sin
[2:00:11] against the blood.
[2:00:15] But there's those that can use their
[2:00:17] body to sin.
[2:00:21] So we will not have the same glory. We
[2:00:23] will not have the same
[2:00:26] the sacrifices that I'm doing, you're
[2:00:29] not doing it. That's the difference.
[2:00:32] Amen. Amen.
[2:00:34] That they say that even amongst the
[2:00:38] stars,
[2:00:39] there's a difference.
[2:00:45] But if the spirit that re that
[2:00:47] resurrected
[2:00:50] Christ from the dead
[2:00:54] dwells in you.
[2:00:56] Amen.
[2:00:58] [Music]
[2:01:01] It doesn't matter where he placed you.
[2:01:03] He will bring you out.
[2:01:06] we will jump a lot of things based on
[2:01:09] because of that
[2:01:11] I will take
[2:01:16] in it is the rising of the sun paragraph
[2:01:19] 55 of
[2:01:24] 1965 the prophet says this oh what a
[2:01:27] wonderful thing that is I am alive
[2:01:31] are quickened
[2:01:33] the the word means
[2:01:36] The word
[2:01:37] quicken, the Greek word
[2:01:42] means that's something that's made alive
[2:01:46] after death. That's
[2:01:47] [Applause]
[2:01:49] right. It means us
[2:01:53] Christians from this end time
[2:01:56] of the message of the hour,
[2:02:00] we killed our membranes, our body.
[2:02:03] [Music]
[2:02:06] The arrogance that was in us, the
[2:02:09] egotist that was in
[2:02:12] us, we considered it
[2:02:16] useless. The sins that were developing
[2:02:19] easily within
[2:02:22] us. We had crucified them, attached them
[2:02:27] to the cross to manifest Jesus
[2:02:31] Christ. It doesn't matter the difficult
[2:02:33] time. It doesn't matter the temptations.
[2:02:37] It doesn't matter the pressure.
[2:02:40] We're
[2:02:41] there by the grace of God.
[2:02:45] Not by our own strength.
[2:02:47] But by the
[2:02:49] spirit, that resurrected Christ. Amen.
[2:02:54] That's
[2:02:55] why we're letting our bodies die. We're
[2:02:59] killing our body, our flesh.
[2:03:01] Amen. Mortifying our
[2:03:05] flesh. Paragraph 56 will speak about the
[2:03:10] seed. Like the seed that goes into the
[2:03:13] earth, he has to
[2:03:15] die. Every bit of the sea, he has to
[2:03:19] rot. Every bit of the
[2:03:21] seed. And every bit of life that was in
[2:03:25] the
[2:03:26] seed has to has to come forth again.
[2:03:31] 57 he was quickened.
[2:03:35] Not not only that.
[2:03:55] Not only that, and I will send the same
[2:03:58] life that quickened me, the power that
[2:04:02] brought me from the grave. I will send
[2:04:05] it upon you to quicken you. And where I
[2:04:10] am, there you will be also.
[2:04:14] May God be praised.
[2:04:20] The time won't permit us. What can I
[2:04:22] take and what can I leave?
[2:04:26] I'll read
[2:04:29] something and it will and we will try to
[2:04:40] land in paragraph 71.
[2:05:01] [Music]
[2:05:03] What he promised to do in Christ, he
[2:05:06] proved it. He proved on the
[2:05:07] resurrection. What he promised to do in
[2:05:10] the days of Moses, he proved it. What he
[2:05:14] promised in the days of Enoch, he proved
[2:05:17] it. In all days of the apostle, he
[2:05:20] proved they
[2:05:42] [Music]
[2:05:47] Amen.
[2:05:58] Amen. Amen. That's a That's a mechanic.
[2:06:02] Amen.
[2:06:19] Paragraph 113. until that church becomes
[2:06:23] both dynamic and mechanic. And the
[2:06:26] spirit of God that moved him to do the
[2:06:29] things that he did, if he hit on six
[2:06:33] cylinders, so will the bride. Amen. For
[2:06:37] he said in John 14:12, he that believeth
[2:06:41] on me, the works that I do shall he do
[2:06:45] also. I'll give him a charge of my
[2:06:49] dynamic and his mechanics that the world
[2:06:53] will not that the world will not be able
[2:06:57] to withstand it. And I will raise him up
[2:07:00] again at the last day. That's the Easter
[2:07:04] message. The dynamic and the mechanic
[2:07:07] together. The dynamic without the
[2:07:09] mechanic no good. Neither is the dynamic
[2:07:13] without the mechanic.
[2:07:38] [Music]
[2:07:43] Command Viv
[2:07:54] [Music]
[2:08:01] [Music]
[2:08:03] Amen. Paragraph 155. If the spirit that
[2:08:07] raised him from the dead, the word, the
[2:08:11] dynamic of the word dwells in you, it
[2:08:15] also quickens your mortal body. Now, how
[2:08:19] we flesh of his flesh and bone of his
[2:08:23] bone because quickly while we're yet
[2:08:27] mortal sinners, mortal ready to die,
[2:08:31] these bodies, it quickens that body.
[2:08:35] What's quickened brings to life the
[2:08:39] spirit that once like to drink, run
[2:08:42] around, commit adultery.
[2:08:45] And this it's quickened. Why? The thing
[2:08:49] died and you are resurrected. It
[2:08:52] quickens your mortal body. Amen.
[2:08:57] Amen. Amen.
[2:09:01] We'll parachute a little.
[2:09:09] I have
[2:09:14] something.
[2:09:20] Amen. Amen. Amen.
[2:09:24] Therefore, your bodies
[2:09:25] [Music]
[2:09:30] to
[2:09:32] resurrection. Resurrection
[2:09:37] [Music]
[2:09:50] Therefore, paragraph 156. Therefore,
[2:09:54] your bodies is the temple of the dynamic
[2:09:57] because why? From the beginning, you are
[2:10:02] part of the mechanic. And brother
[2:10:04] Brandham hates hates the pulpit once.
[2:10:07] Oh, there is your resurrection.
[2:10:10] There is the church in the
[2:10:13] resurrection with him. These bodies
[2:10:17] right now are quickened. See, you've
[2:10:20] heard, you believed it, you believe it.
[2:10:23] Changed you from denomination to the
[2:10:26] word.
[2:10:28] See? Amen. Amen.
[2:10:33] We'll jump a lot.
[2:10:45] 245. Paragraph 245. Look, notice. But
[2:10:48] God foresaw the bride in the groom.
[2:10:51] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:10:55] See, to save his wife,
[2:10:58] like Adam,
[2:11:03] he had to go with
[2:11:08] her. Adam knowed what he was
[2:11:13] doing. If didn't know what she was
[2:11:15] doing,
[2:11:18] But Adam walked out with his wife. See,
[2:11:25] Eve had fallen and Adam supported him.
[2:11:29] Supported
[2:11:30] her. Eve didn't know what she was
[2:11:33] doing. It's the same thing that Jesus
[2:11:36] did.
[2:11:39] And Jesus took his wife's place which is
[2:11:42] us the
[2:11:44] church and became sin.
[2:11:49] Me and you who had committed sin
[2:11:52] and he became
[2:11:55] sin. Amen. Amen.
[2:11:59] He became sin.
[2:12:02] May God be praised.
[2:12:05] He became sin for her. Remember, he
[2:12:07] became you.
[2:12:09] He became you. He bestowed your
[2:12:12] punishment that you might stand in his
[2:12:15] place.
[2:12:17] He stood in your place.
[2:12:21] So Jesus takes your place, my brother,
[2:12:23] my sister.
[2:12:25] You also have to take his place. Amen.
[2:12:29] Amen.
[2:12:31] You had to take his place.
[2:12:38] He stood in your place that you might
[2:12:41] stand in his place. What a love. What a
[2:12:45] fellowship. How can we deny
[2:12:51] it? How can we do anything but love him?
[2:12:56] My friend,
[2:12:58] [Music]
[2:12:59] the prophet says, "I could stay on a
[2:13:02] hours
[2:13:10] But because of time we're pressing. And
[2:13:12] when a man has said that he believes the
[2:13:16] word and then the Holy Spirit comes,
[2:13:22] it is an abstract to the
[2:13:26] title that gives you permission.
[2:13:31] When you have that abstract
[2:13:34] that every bit of that belongs to you
[2:13:39] and everything and everything is on it
[2:13:43] belongs to
[2:13:45] you. Amen.
[2:13:49] Brennham,
[2:14:05] [Music]
[2:14:08] and that gives us the abstract. When the
[2:14:12] Holy Ghost comes upon this title deed
[2:14:15] that God saw back yonder,
[2:14:19] for the foundation of the world and put
[2:14:22] a name on the book of life. Put put a
[2:14:26] name on the book of life. But was born
[2:14:28] through a man and a woman and subject to
[2:14:31] sin and guilty to and guilty of sin. But
[2:14:36] when I believe on it, I received the
[2:14:39] deed. But when the Holy Ghost come, it
[2:14:43] was the abstract that everything against
[2:14:46] me, whether whether my mother done it,
[2:14:51] my father done it, my grandfather done
[2:14:53] it,
[2:15:24] But paragraph 250, but when the abstract
[2:15:28] has come, it struck off omitted
[2:15:31] everything. I'm an abstract holder then.
[2:15:34] Amen. And as sure as the spirit that
[2:15:37] raised Christ from the dead, I have a
[2:15:40] abstract that I'm part of that body with
[2:15:43] the abstract of the Holy Ghost making
[2:15:46] the body of the word live out just
[2:15:49] exactly like it did in him as he
[2:15:52] promised in the last day. The abstract
[2:15:55] all my sin are struck out. All your sins
[2:15:58] are struck out by the blood of Jesus
[2:16:01] Christ. The Holy Ghost is come as an
[2:16:04] abstract to the title deed that God gave
[2:16:07] me by grace, by fornowledge. Oh my.
[2:16:17] This evening, he's telling you in
[2:16:19] paragraph 251, what what you scared
[2:16:23] about? Are you scared about sickness?
[2:16:26] Are you scared about cancer? Are you
[2:16:29] scared about sterility? Are you scared
[2:16:31] because you're not married yet?
[2:16:34] Are you scared because you don't um you
[2:16:36] haven't found a fiance yet?
[2:16:38] Are you scared of
[2:16:41] failing? Are you scared because you
[2:16:43] don't have a job?
[2:16:45] What are you scared about this
[2:16:50] evening? No wonder he said, "Fear not."
[2:16:56] He said, "I am he that was dead
[2:17:00] and alive again,
[2:17:05] and I'm alive forever more."
[2:17:09] I had the keys of
[2:17:11] death and hell,
[2:17:16] don't worry about
[2:17:19] nothing. Even death ain't going to hurt
[2:17:22] you.
[2:17:26] the the abstract title,
[2:17:30] the the debt was settled,
[2:17:35] everything against it,
[2:17:38] everything against it has been struck
[2:17:41] off when people
[2:17:43] like Steven the prophet said like
[2:17:50] when when they were stoning him
[2:17:54] He wasn't worried about people stoning
[2:17:57] him. He just opened his mouth.
[2:18:00] He said, "Forgive them." He saw heaven
[2:18:04] open. Amen.
[2:18:07] Why? Because he had a title
[2:18:11] deed. of the owner, the abstract owner.
[2:18:16] He was not scared of death.
[2:18:19] When
[2:18:20] Philillip had this title,
[2:18:24] he could
[2:18:27] move in the dark in the spirit of a
[2:18:31] dog. You remember when he was with the
[2:18:34] um Enoch
[2:18:37] Ethiopian after the baptism when he
[2:18:41] disappeared because he had the title D.
[2:18:45] I'm trying to
[2:18:47] jump because I need to come
[2:18:52] down. There's extremely a lot. If I
[2:18:54] continue to read, we won't
[2:19:02] do. So, I'm coming down to Ezekiel
[2:19:09] [Music]
[2:19:11] 3 to 7.
[2:19:15] God has said to Ezekiel
[2:19:19] to prophesy upon tribal he says son of
[2:19:22] man can you prophesy upon this can you
[2:19:27] call the spirit of the four
[2:19:30] wings so these dry
[2:19:33] bones they were they were extremely
[2:19:37] numerous it was probably a whole nation
[2:19:41] for these bones
[2:19:43] wounds to
[2:19:45] have to have flesh to have nerves to
[2:19:49] have life and so they may live and this
[2:19:52] evening
[2:19:54] this Ezekiel
[2:19:56] I'm standing here like
[2:19:59] Ezekiel I don't know the um bones that I
[2:20:04] don't know the dead bones you Ezekiel
[2:20:07] had
[2:20:10] prophesied I don't know in which Are
[2:20:13] you We're in the season of the
[2:20:15] resurrection of our Lord Jesus. If the
[2:20:18] spirit that was in Christ that he
[2:20:20] resurrected the dead is in you and it it
[2:20:25] is in us right now. It doesn't matter
[2:20:27] your condition. It doesn't matter your
[2:20:29] your bones that are separated. It
[2:20:33] doesn't matter where they buried you.
[2:20:35] Where they had put you in the car in the
[2:20:38] in the cave.
[2:20:40] It doesn't matter the
[2:20:42] prison that they bound
[2:20:44] you. They the strings that they they
[2:20:48] tied you. Maybe your hell that they
[2:20:50] condemned you the situation that they
[2:20:53] condemned you that you cannot become
[2:20:56] this that you cannot have this you
[2:20:59] cannot do
[2:21:00] this this
[2:21:03] evening. The spirit that quicken Jesus
[2:21:06] Christ. The spirit of Jesus Christ. May
[2:21:09] that spirit leave. May the spirit the
[2:21:12] living God, may that manifest itself in
[2:21:15] your life, in your situation. May that
[2:21:18] bring life in the life of your
[2:21:21] children. The situation that's
[2:21:23] tormenting you. The condition that's
[2:21:25] tormenting you. Maybe it this is the
[2:21:28] worries of the children.
[2:21:30] made
[2:21:31] it. The spirit that had resurrected
[2:21:34] Jesus, the spirit of the living God, the
[2:21:37] spirit that that quickened, the spirit
[2:21:39] of the living God that's in our midst,
[2:21:43] may it manifest
[2:21:44] itself. May it take his
[2:21:47] bones in front of people that have
[2:21:49] issues, in front of people that have
[2:21:51] situations. May that bring
[2:21:55] healing. May you remove your incred your
[2:21:58] unbelief. Your
[2:22:00] unbelief will not stop God from doing
[2:22:03] it. In the name of Jesus, I'm declaring
[2:22:06] you
[2:22:07] healed, your
[2:22:10] situation. It doesn't matter what the
[2:22:12] devil had cut down. God is capable to
[2:22:16] restore you this evening in the name of
[2:22:19] Jesus Christ. Receive your healing in
[2:22:22] the name of Jesus Christ.
[2:22:24] The church may
[2:22:26] rise when the pastor is coming forth.
[2:22:30] When the pastor is coming
[2:22:32] forth, doesn't matter your situation,
[2:22:35] God is capable. God is
[2:22:38] capable to give you the desire of your
[2:22:41] heart. If your
[2:22:44] spirit, if the spirit that resurrected
[2:22:46] Jesus
[2:22:47] Christ is in his church this
[2:22:50] evening, is in his bride,
[2:22:54] The bride of the Lord Jesus Christ is
[2:22:56] the
[2:22:58] church. May that be given based on his
[2:23:02] word when the Lord with the man of God
[2:23:05] will continue to pray. It doesn't matter
[2:23:08] your condition. He's the same this
[2:23:11] evening. Praise God. Let's pray.

[2:23:29] the valleys that your children are in.
[2:23:33] You know the situation in their life
[2:23:35] that they tried like Peter, leaning upon
[2:23:39] their own
[2:23:41] understanding, leaning upon our own
[2:23:43] abilities. Father where we fail maybe in
[2:23:46] the marriages maybe at work maybe in the
[2:23:50] businesses maybe in the way to manage
[2:23:52] our finances at home whichever aspect of

[2:24:32] you did on Calvary. What you did on
[2:24:34] Calvary today, it might be a story, but
[2:24:38] that story is still living. It is a true
[2:24:41] story and it mark a great difference and
[2:24:44] it make a difference between
[2:24:46] Christianity and every other religion
[2:24:49] because the owner the one who started

[2:25:11] mother who is Lord Father streaming
[2:25:13] tonight, Lord, Father, I commit her body
[2:25:16] unto thy hand. Father Lord Jesus Christ
[2:25:19] we are prophesying because according to
[2:25:22] the commission of the bread according to
[2:25:24] Revelation 10 8-11 you told us to eat
[2:25:28] the book and after having eaten the book
[2:25:31] Lord Father you gave us the authority to
[2:25:35] prophesy that's why in the name of Jesus
[2:25:38] Christ we are prophesying healing we are
[2:25:41] prophesying deliverance we are
[2:25:43] prophesying complete deliverance but not
[2:25:46] deliverance Lord from everything that

[2:26:16] their body, give us mercy, Lord, Father,
[2:26:20] as we go into our respective place. We
[2:26:22] thank you, Lord, Father, for everything

[2:26:27] Christ. Hallelujah. Let's give the Lord

[2:26:31] [Applause]
[2:26:33] [Music]
[2:26:37] offering. Amen.
[2:26:40] It looks like the Holy Spirit gave you
[2:26:42] the Easter message before Sunday. Amen.
[2:26:46] God created himself a body, the body of
[2:26:50] the Lord Jesus Christ. That was the body
[2:26:52] of God himself that was created by an
[2:26:55] immaculate blood. Amen. Amen. And God
[2:26:59] identify himself to that body so that
[2:27:03] him and the body became one. Amen. So
[2:27:05] that when you kill that body, it will be
[2:27:08] considered as you kill God even though
[2:27:11] God cannot die. So God sanctioned the
[2:27:14] body of Jesus Christ so that he can take
[2:27:17] death in that body. And when God receive
[2:27:20] death through the body of Jesus Christ,
[2:27:23] it has been now imputed unto God that he
[2:27:27] die for our sin. Amen. Amen. The Bible
