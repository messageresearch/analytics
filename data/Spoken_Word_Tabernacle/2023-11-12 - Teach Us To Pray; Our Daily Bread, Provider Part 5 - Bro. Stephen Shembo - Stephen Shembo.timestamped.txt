[56:20] until you are in my in my shoes then you
[56:24] know what I'm talking about and then I
[56:26] have to obey I even have to repent to
[56:29] him because I say I was trying to go
[56:30] this direction and he's telling me go
[56:32] this direction so he's the boss I'm not
[56:35] the one preaching he's the one preaching
[56:37] so I have to follow his instruction
[56:40] that's why you going to see this the
[56:41] title is changing here but as I submit
[56:45] myself to him he begin to unfold to me
[56:48] clearly that whatever is going on in
[56:50] teachers to pray is actually capping
[56:54] that's the position the condition of rof
[56:58] before the Rapture that's
[57:00] it are you up to date with the sermon
[57:04] amen were you here on Wednesday did you
[57:06] follow Wednesday

[1:06:57] and when you hunger you probably were
[1:07:00] expecting to get food from
[1:07:02] McDonald but he gave you food that
[1:07:05] nobody in this
[1:07:07] world can produce
[1:07:10] it so a Divine hunger require a Divine
[1:07:17] food everybody okay everybody okay and
[1:07:21] what is the name of the food my friend
[1:07:22] man
[1:07:24] the name of the food is
[1:07:27] Mana if you read the Bible just like
[1:07:29] this you will miss things we need to
[1:07:32] understand what is Mana the Bible call
[1:07:35] Mana the food of
[1:07:40] angels amen and uh brother Branham also
[1:07:43] says this glory to God brother Branham
[1:07:46] say now there is some connection between
[1:07:50] him and
[1:07:51] Jehovah because he was created creating
[1:07:54] that bread and that
[1:07:57] fish I hope you're getting where I'm
[1:08:00] going right there before me no one else
[1:08:04] could do that but who Jehovah in other
[1:08:07] words Jesus was Jehovah in flesh and
[1:08:10] that's the same God that my mother told
[1:08:13] me about in the wilderness back there
[1:08:17] who brought what bre down from what
[1:08:20] creation so Mana was a cre yeed
[1:08:29] bread Mana was a bread that was
[1:08:37] created amen a created bread from
[1:08:41] creation out of what heaven we with our
[1:08:44] own eyes seen him today do what create
[1:08:47] bread right before us let's go back to
[1:08:50] our scripture and read it again verse
[1:08:52] three and he humbled you and allowed you
[1:08:55] to hunger and fed you with Mana which
[1:08:59] you knew not remember on
[1:09:02] Wednesday nobody knew this before you're
[1:09:05] the first one to test
[1:09:07] it is that hunger good or
[1:09:10] bad is that hunger good and
[1:09:14] bad so you can go to a trial to
[1:09:16] experience something nobody in your
[1:09:18] family
[1:09:20] experience that's it that's it nobody in
[1:09:24] your family will will even experience it
[1:09:27] because man had the beginning and stop
[1:09:29] somewhere that's right that's right amen
[1:09:33] he says and your neither did your father
[1:09:37] knows that he man make you
[1:09:40] know so the purpose of
[1:09:44] Mana in other word the coming down of
[1:09:47] Mana has a message that's
[1:09:50] right Mana didn't just come to satisfy
[1:09:55] the
[1:09:57] hunger Mana had a message the first
[1:10:01] message is a natural satisfaction to
[1:10:04] quench the hunger but there was a
[1:10:07] message within the
[1:10:09] message if you miss that that's when we
[1:10:12] get in trouble so when Mana comes he
[1:10:15] brought a message which is to take
[1:10:20] care of the
[1:10:22] hunger
[1:10:24] and the second message now God
[1:10:27] explaining he says to make you know that
[1:10:32] man does not live by what bread only
[1:10:35] because the bread that you receive
[1:10:38] nobody brought it it was a bread that
[1:10:41] was created are we
[1:10:44] together but by every word that proceed
[1:10:47] out of the mouth of who the Lord does
[1:10:50] what man live he's showing Israel that I
[1:10:54] gave you food that was created not by
[1:10:57] you nobody created it I'm the only one
[1:11:01] who created this food to teach you that
[1:11:04] even if you don't pack something in your
[1:11:08] bag even if you don't go shopping
[1:11:13] amen it's not a problem amen whether you
[1:11:17] pack enough food from Egypt amen for the
[1:11:20] journey or not that's not what I want
[1:11:23] you to understand amen I want you to
[1:11:26] understand that I am a God that can
[1:11:30] [Applause]
[1:11:31] create and the creation comes by the
[1:11:34] word of God Amen in other word if you
[1:11:37] can have just the word of God the word
[1:11:40] of God will create whatever you want
[1:11:43] amen so the are we together so the
[1:11:47] message of Mana is a double message it's
[1:11:51] a two-fold message it's a message M to
[1:11:54] take care of the necessary food but he
[1:11:56] also tells you that God is telling you
[1:12:00] that I can take care of you no matter
[1:12:03] what's
[1:12:05] happening whether your father left you a
[1:12:08] bank account or not that's not the
[1:12:11] problem men shall not leave by bread
[1:12:14] alone but by every word in other words
[1:12:18] if you get the word you can leave with
[1:12:20] it that's right if you just have the
[1:12:23] word God you can live with the word
[1:12:26] matter of fact you can eat bread and
[1:12:30] die everybody okay but the word of God
[1:12:33] can stop even you're dying amen am amen
[1:12:37] because Mana had a temporary was given
[1:12:40] had an expiration
[1:12:44] date you cannot keep Mana all the way to
[1:12:47] the next day so the Mana was the food
[1:12:50] for one day but when they took Mana into
[1:12:53] the the holiest man remain
[1:12:58] forever don't worry my friend we will
[1:13:01] get there amen verse four your Remnant
[1:13:04] works not old upon you neither did your
[1:13:08] foot your car swell these how many days
[1:13:12] 40 years so God took care even of their
[1:13:18] clothing and he took care of their
[1:13:22] health
[1:13:24] amen amen amen amen amen amen Mana was
[1:13:29] created for the children of Israel by
[1:13:33] God because Israel was under a prophet
[1:13:37] and that Prophet was called Moses and
[1:13:40] Moses was given two
[1:13:42] sons and one of his son was in the hand
[1:13:46] everybody okay and Moses already
[1:13:49] experienced the third pool himself amen
[1:13:52] that's right amen yes sir everybody okay
[1:13:55] because Moses would speak and flies come
[1:13:58] nobody else experienced that except
[1:14:01] Moses but when they get into the
[1:14:04] Wilderness God didn't want to stop that
[1:14:06] experience to Moses alone amen now God
[1:14:09] begin to to extend the experience to
[1:14:12] Israel am so that everybody can
[1:14:15] experience the creative power of
[1:14:18] God listen to brother Bram on this glory
[1:14:22] to God brother Bram says this he says
[1:14:25] now I want to ask you something if the
[1:14:29] blood of BS bull and a and or a goat be
[1:14:35] used for the for a bleach which can only
[1:14:38] do what cover could put a man in a
[1:14:41] position to do what speak the creative

[1:15:29] Moses did something how can you doubt

[1:22:47] the eyes of of servants look to the
[1:22:51] water hand of their Masters they're not
[1:22:53] looking at their
[1:22:57] masters they are looking at
[1:22:59] what so what is in the hand of the

[1:24:34] expectation amen a servant is having
[1:24:38] toward a master or a maiden toward her
[1:24:41] mistress David said that's the same
[1:24:44] expectation I'm looking toward God and

[1:25:51] when he sees this this is Jesus one of
[1:25:54] his disciples said to him Lord do what
[1:25:56] teach us to pray so we can teach
[1:25:59] somebody to pray as John also did what
[1:26:02] taught his disciples so Jesus was not
[1:26:05] the first one to teach people how to
[1:26:06] pray amen amen and he said unto them
[1:26:10] when you pray say what Our Father which
[1:26:14] are in heaven Hallowed be thy name your

[1:28:36] subject this morning is teach us to pray
[1:28:40] Our Daily Bread
[1:28:46] provider on Wednesday we started with
[1:28:50] Matthew where where the Bible say give
[1:28:53] us this day our daily bread everybody
[1:28:58] clear from this sentence here we stated
[1:29:03] or we establish again a the relationship
[1:29:06] that existed between the
[1:29:09] father who is God you remember and his
[1:29:15] child meaning his son or
[1:29:19] daughter amen and this
[1:29:22] appear as
[1:29:24] us amen and from this give us this day
[1:29:29] we found out that this statement speak
[1:29:33] of dependency you remember on Wednesday
[1:29:37] dependency on the side of a
[1:29:42] child amen and on the side of the father
[1:29:47] is speaking about
[1:29:48] responsibility you remember that yes
[1:29:52] amen then from there we found out that
[1:29:56] there is also an
[1:29:59] assurance amen that goes with this
[1:30:02] because the child cannot just come to
[1:30:04] the father and say give me bread just
[1:30:07] like that because the child knows
[1:30:09] exactly that the father have bread as we
[1:30:13] go back to our slide here brother Bram
[1:30:16] says this
[1:30:18] Amen brother Bram says if you need

[1:30:51] don't have to say that to God you don't
[1:30:54] have to say what you don't have to say
[1:30:57] to God if you got healing power why
[1:31:02] because he has it
[1:31:05] amen when we talk to one another we
[1:31:08] usually say if you can help me because
[1:31:12] we are not sure whether you can help or
[1:31:14] not and brother bam say when you going
[1:31:17] to God you don't talk to God like that
[1:31:19] am because God goes with

[1:31:45] Bram would you give me a dollar I need
[1:31:48] something to eat why of course I would
[1:31:51] you know that
[1:31:52] if I had if I had it I give it to you
[1:31:55] anytime I it would uh I would have a a
[1:31:59] horrible heart if I didn't thank you my
[1:32:01] brother and me being how a cruel sinful
[1:32:05] man who's saying that brother BR brother
[1:32:08] brandham say and me being a
[1:32:11] cruel sinful man and who be that
[1:32:15] good-hearted to somebody like you what
[1:32:18] will God be
[1:32:20] amen remember on Wednesday amen amen God
[1:32:25] have what you have need of brother Bram
[1:32:27] continue he say if you being evil know
[1:32:32] how to give good gift how much more will
[1:32:36] your heavenly father give them the
[1:32:38] spirit that ask for it if you ask for a
[1:32:43] fish would he give you a serpent ask for
[1:32:46] bread would he give you a stone
[1:32:49] certainly not brother Bram said say why
[1:32:52] if you just ask him in that way with
[1:32:55] faith believing that you will get it
[1:32:58] from him how a million times quicker a
[1:33:01] million times quicker than you will get
[1:33:04] anything from
[1:33:06] me so God not only give but he give it
[1:33:11] quickly everybody okay and you know he
[1:33:14] will help you you know I'll help you I
[1:33:17] do anything I could any of this brother
[1:33:20] would we dig every penny out of the
[1:33:23] pocket to help you we do anything we
[1:33:25] could but this is something you got to
[1:33:28] believe by what faith so with God
[1:33:32] between you and him when you asking
[1:33:34] there is an assurance that whatever you
[1:33:37] ask God will give it to you by Assurance
[1:33:40] we talking about a confidence we talking
[1:33:43] about a certainty we talking about a
[1:33:47] word of Honor we talking about a
[1:33:50] guarantee that God will grant it to you
[1:33:54] everybody okay and when we spoke about
[1:33:57] it we reinforce this by scripture where
[1:34:00] Jesus say if we ask for
[1:34:03] bread will God give you what a
[1:34:07] stone the one who can give you stone is
[1:34:10] the
[1:34:12] devil because when Jesus was hungry and
[1:34:16] the devil came to him he didn't give him
[1:34:19] bread he turned him to the stone he said
[1:34:23] take this Stone and turn them into
[1:34:26] bread only the devil can do that and
[1:34:29] Jesus say It is written amen and do you
[1:34:32] know what happened to Jesus Christ the
[1:34:34] Bible say the angel came and brought him
[1:34:37] food Elijah went through trouble and an
[1:34:40] angel bring him food amen because men
[1:34:44] shall not live by bread alone amen but
[1:34:46] by every word even if there is nobody to
[1:34:50] give you food Heaven is always open
[1:34:54] amen Heaven is guaranteed
[1:34:58] am everybody okay are we together he
[1:35:03] says if you ask for a fish fish would
[1:35:06] you give you what a
[1:35:09] serpent and you ask for what egg would
[1:35:13] you give you what a scorpion and Jesus
[1:35:16] moved from bread to fish to egg and he
[1:35:20] went down to give
[1:35:23] you remember on Wednesday and from gift
[1:35:26] plural he went down to
[1:35:28] things plural gift we don't know what it
[1:35:32] is anything can be a gift anything can
[1:35:35] be a thing and then he dropped down to
[1:35:37] the Holy
[1:35:39] Ghost which is the gift of God the good
[1:35:44] and perfect gift of God because James
[1:35:46] say anything that is good and perfect it
[1:35:49] comes from the father above
[1:35:52] everybody clear so when we look at this
[1:35:55] two here in the Book of Matthew Matthew
[1:35:58] uses the word bread and fish he said if
[1:36:02] they ask you for bread he's not going to
[1:36:04] give a stone if they ask you for fish
[1:36:06] he's not going to give you a serpent
[1:36:08] look at these two things that Matthew Ed
[1:36:11] right here let's go in our scripture
[1:36:13] Into the Book of John chapter six let's
[1:36:16] look at fish and
[1:36:18] bread
[1:36:19] hallu John chapter 6 if you dare you can
[1:36:24] say
[1:36:26] Amen John 6 verse
[1:36:35] 5 glory to God you there
[1:36:40] amen the Bible says when Jesus then lift
[1:36:44] up his eyes and so who a great company
[1:36:47] come unto him a great company come unto
[1:36:50] him he says to
[1:36:52] Phillip where where shall we buy bread
[1:36:57] Who start the word
[1:36:59] bread where shall we buy bread that
[1:37:03] these may
[1:37:04] eat so he's not a God that only D to
[1:37:08] preach to you the word but he has to
[1:37:10] care for your
[1:37:13] need after you listen to the sermon God
[1:37:16] have to take care of something that is
[1:37:18] not a
[1:37:20] sermon
[1:37:21] that's
[1:37:22] it everybody okay he's a God that goes
[1:37:26] beyond the
[1:37:27] sermon because we have a tendency to
[1:37:29] look at God I need spiritual food I need
[1:37:31] spiritual you fooling
[1:37:33] yourself don't worry stay stay that way
[1:37:38] amen am amen amen he say and this he
[1:37:41] says to do what prove him to prove him
[1:37:44] for he himself what knew what he would
[1:37:47] so before God put you into a test God
[1:37:51] already know
[1:37:54] amen hallelujah are we together amen
[1:37:57] before you go through a test God already
[1:38:00] know what he's going to do so before he
[1:38:02] ask philli a question he already have a
[1:38:05] backup plan
[1:38:07] amen yes sir are we together oh glory to
[1:38:12] God he says then he says to prove him
[1:38:15] for he himself knew what he will do amen
[1:38:19] amen Phillip answered him humanistic way
[1:38:23] 200 penny worth of bread is not
[1:38:26] sufficient for them that every one of
[1:38:28] them may take a what little maybe in
[1:38:31] their bank account the treasury look and
[1:38:34] say you know what we only have 200 they
[1:38:37] say with 200 look at the number of these
[1:38:39] people can 200 bread feed this people
[1:38:43] it's not going to work but Jesus knew
[1:38:46] Jesus didn't ask that question just like
[1:38:48] that he was trying to train his
[1:38:50] disciples
[1:38:52] into something amen that even if money
[1:38:55] in the bank is not enough to take care
[1:38:59] of the need I'm trying to teach you
[1:39:03] something there is no Bank in this place
[1:39:06] the money that you have in the treasury
[1:39:07] is not sufficient but there is always a
[1:39:11] solution are we together father help me
[1:39:15] he says verse 8 one of his disciple
[1:39:18] Andrew Simon Peter's brother says to him
[1:39:22] there is a
[1:39:23] lad amen here which have what five
[1:39:27] barley loaves bread and what two small
[1:39:31] fishes and this is what Matthew asked he
[1:39:34] says if if your son ask you for a bread
[1:39:37] and a fish now we got bread and a fish
[1:39:39] that came together why only bread and
[1:39:44] fish why they didn't have maybe a tomato
[1:39:47] over
[1:39:49] there let's see the father
[1:39:51] in the sun everybody okay two two small
[1:39:56] fishes but what are they among so many
[1:40:01] and Jesus say are we together Jesus say
[1:40:05] make the man sit down now there was so
[1:40:09] much grass there was much grass in the
[1:40:11] place so the men sat down in number of
[1:40:15] about how many people 5,000 and Jesus
[1:40:18] Took the Loaves and and when he has
[1:40:21] given what thanks Thanksgiving he
[1:40:24] distributed to the disciple and the
[1:40:27] disciple to them that were set down and
[1:40:29] likewise of the fishes as much as the
[1:40:33] what wood so something begin to happen
[1:40:36] in the hand of Jesus Christ Jesus begin
[1:40:40] to
[1:40:44] create remember when there was no food
[1:40:47] in the wilderness Jesus created bread
[1:40:51] amen and when there were no food to feed
[1:40:53] 5,000 people and More Jesus be to create
[1:40:59] amen so the miracle here is the miracle
[1:41:04] of
[1:41:06] creation on on everybody okay am the
[1:41:09] miracle of
[1:41:12] creation everybody okay am he says when
[1:41:16] they were filled verse 12 he says to his
[1:41:19] disciple do what gather up the fragments
[1:41:22] that remain if you notice verse 11 the
[1:41:24] Bible say as much as they would in other
[1:41:28] words everybody have their portion but
[1:41:32] God didn't stop at the
[1:41:35] portion because God can give how
[1:41:39] exceedingly and how abundantly he didn't
[1:41:42] stop at the portion my God always give
[1:41:45] Bon
[1:41:47] am
[1:41:48] am come
[1:41:52] he gave
[1:41:55] beyond what was expected verse uh 12
[1:41:59] when they were filled he says to his
[1:42:01] disciple gather up the
[1:42:04] fragments that remaineth that nothing be
[1:42:06] what lost you clear verse 13 therefore
[1:42:11] they gathered them together and filled
[1:42:14] 12 basket with the fragment of the five
[1:42:17] barley loaves which remain over and ab
[1:42:21] to them that had what this is a
[1:42:24] multiplication of the bread and the fish
[1:42:27] to take care of his children that were
[1:42:29] hungry we clear Amen jop to verse 26
[1:42:32] this is where I'm going you
[1:42:34] there the next day the people came and
[1:42:38] they didn't see Jesus and they told them
[1:42:41] you know what Jesus went to the other
[1:42:42] side and everybody follow him they say
[1:42:45] Lord we come look at Jesus when he saw
[1:42:48] them verse 26 Jesus answered them and
[1:42:51] say verily verily I say to you you seek
[1:42:56] me not because you saw what the Miracles
[1:43:01] but because you did itat what of the
[1:43:03] loaves the Loaves and were what were
[1:43:07] filled so when Jesus was creating bread
[1:43:11] he was not really just creating
[1:43:14] bread he was saying
[1:43:17] something when Jesus was creating Mana
[1:43:20] he was not just creating Mana to take
[1:43:23] care of the immediate hunger Mana has a
[1:43:26] message amen everybody together so Jesus
[1:43:30] now begin to bring
[1:43:33] two aspect he says with what happen I
[1:43:38] didn't just took care of your
[1:43:40] natural immediate need everybody okay

[1:43:48] miracle because of something
[1:43:51] but the problem with you instead of
[1:43:54] being
[1:43:55] caught by the miracle you were cut by

[1:44:01] miracle

[1:44:06] give you bread and you enjoying the
[1:44:09] bread don't look at the bread look at
[1:44:11] the source of the bread

[1:54:08] sea and he alone on the water land so
[1:54:11] everybody's in the ship going he stay on
[1:54:13] the other side because he knew how he's
[1:54:16] going to get to the other side he didn't
[1:54:17] need any ship
[1:54:21] amen thank you and he saw them toing in
[1:54:25] rowing for the wind was contrary to them
[1:54:29] about the Fourth Watch of the night he
[1:54:31] comes to them doing what walking upon
[1:54:33] the sea and would have passed what by
[1:54:37] them can we read this together can we
[1:54:40] read this together Who start The Who
[1:54:42] start traveling before the disciple but
[1:54:46] a man walking is taking
[1:54:48] over
[1:54:50] and did you see what he did to them when
[1:54:52] he saw them he even bypassed
[1:54:55] them God bless
[1:54:57] you God bless
[1:55:00] you what is God teaching us what is he
[1:55:05] teaching
[1:55:07] us can I continue he sees you in trouble

[1:55:14] going what is he teaching us watch what
[1:55:17] he's teaching you my friend you there
[1:55:20] and would have passed by them verse 49
[1:55:23] but when they did what saw him doing
[1:55:26] what walking upon the they suppos he had
[1:55:28] been a what a spirit and they did what
[1:55:30] cried out now it's another problem a
[1:55:34] problem with the Sheep now a ghost in
[1:55:36] the midst of a
[1:55:37] ship everybody okay verse 50 for they
[1:55:42] all saw him and were how trouble watch
[1:55:46] and immediately he talk with them and
[1:55:49] said to to them be what of good cheer it
[1:55:51] is who I what Be not Afraid and he went
[1:55:56] up to them into the sheep and the wind
[1:55:58] did what ceased and they were so amazing
[1:56:01] themselves beyond measure and did what
[1:56:04] Wonder spoken word watch verse
[1:56:07] 52 for they consider not the what
[1:56:11] Miracle of the
[1:56:16] laws what has the loes to do with a
[1:56:21] wind this is the wind in the midst of
[1:56:24] the sea but the Bible says they got in
[1:56:28] trouble not
[1:56:31] remembering not understanding the loes
[1:56:35] so God did the loaves to prepare them
[1:56:39] for the
[1:56:44] trip let me start it again let's read it
[1:56:48] again verse 52 I'm going this way
[1:56:50] because I cannot move faster if you
[1:56:52] don't get it verse 52 for they consider
[1:56:56] not the miracle of the water Lo for
[1:56:59] their heart was how
[1:57:03] hardened so when the trouble came in the
[1:57:06] sea Jesus expect the disciple to
[1:57:09] remember the
[1:57:11] loaves amen not to remember the loaves
[1:57:14] that they ate but to remember the
[1:57:17] miracle of the loav
[1:57:21] in other words if God can save us in the
[1:57:24] midst of the Wilderness and create bread
[1:57:28] there is nothing that God cannot take
[1:57:31] care of it you need to use that Miracle
[1:57:34] to win the devil on the
[1:57:36] [Applause]
[1:57:40] next are we together what has loves have
[1:57:44] to do with a wind it's two different
[1:57:47] things but Jesus say they should should
[1:57:49] have remembered the loaves if you
[1:57:51] remember the loaves like David he give
[1:57:54] you power he give you Revelation now you
[1:57:58] can look at the wind and you can win the
[1:58:01] wind based on the Miracle of the loes
[1:58:04] but if you miss the loaves you're going
[1:58:06] to get in trouble with the
[1:58:08] wind are we together amen are we
[1:58:11] together amen what are you trying to say
[1:58:14] listen to
[1:58:15] this the Bible says in the book of in
[1:58:18] the Book of Matthew chapter 16 Jesus
[1:58:21] said to them take heed and be aware of
[1:58:24] what the leav of the what Pharisees and
[1:58:27] the what the Sadducees Jesus uses only
[1:58:30] the vocabulary leav as soon as Jesus say
[1:58:34] leav in their
[1:58:37] mind bread watch the next verse and they
[1:58:41] did what reasoned among them themselves
[1:58:43] saying it is what because we have taken
[1:58:46] no
[1:58:48] bread
[1:58:50] all Jesus say is just leav to them it's
[1:58:54] not just Le they say what why did you
[1:58:57] hear him saying
[1:58:59] 11 what do you think he say 11 one say I
[1:59:01] know him if he start 11 like this
[1:59:04] meaning because we didn't pack bread so
[1:59:06] maybe he's
[1:59:09] hungry everybody okay everybody okay he
[1:59:12] needed a lunch
[1:59:15] boox listen my friend verse eight which
[1:59:18] when Jesus preach ceive he said to them
[1:59:20] oh what ye of little faith do you see
[1:59:23] what is going on why reason ye among
[1:59:27] yourself because ye have brought what no
[1:59:30] bread do ye not do ye not yet do what
[1:59:36] understand in other words the miracle of
[1:59:38] God have a message
[1:59:44] amen father help me glory to God can I
[1:59:49] raise hear the miracle of God has
[1:59:53] something and God say did you not from
[1:59:56] the miracle did you not
[2:00:01] understand understand
[2:00:03] what did you not understand K neither
[2:00:07] what remember God in the wilderness told
[2:00:11] Israel do what
[2:00:13] remember did you not understand or what
[2:00:17] remember two word
[2:00:20] or remember remember what did you not

[2:00:36] and even gave you more than what was
[2:00:40] needed you didn't understand and you
[2:00:43] don't even remember two words verse 10
[2:00:46] needed the what seven loaves of the
[2:00:49] 4,000 and how many basket what he took
[2:00:52] so I did this miracle twice and I did it
[2:00:56] the same way and gave you over but it
[2:00:58] looks like you don't understand and you
[2:01:01] don't remember it is there is a power in
[2:01:06] understanding what God is doing and not
[2:01:09] only understanding but
[2:01:11] remembering what God did for you
[2:01:15] amen amen amen everybody okay amen what
[2:01:19] are you trying to say brother Steven
[2:01:21] listen to this in Psalm 10 106 verse 7
[2:01:26] the bible says this David Our Father
[2:01:29] what understood not stop our father did

[2:01:34] of David understood not what thy wonders
[2:01:39] in Egypt th th what wonders what is a
[2:01:43] Wonder so our father did not understand
[2:01:46] the miracle of God in Egypt so when God
[2:01:49] was doing miracle in Egypt he was not
[2:01:53] just displaying his power he was
[2:01:55] teaching Israel something
[2:02:00] amen and he want Israel to understand
[2:02:04] something Our Father did not understand
[2:02:07] your Miracle or your
[2:02:09] wonders follow me carefully Hallelujah
[2:02:12] give us this day amen Our
[2:02:15] Father uh Our Father understood not that
[2:02:18] Wonder in EG Egypt they what remember
[2:02:21] not do you see those two
[2:02:23] words understanding and what remember
[2:02:26] they did not understand and neither did
[2:02:28] they what remember remember they didn't
[2:02:31] remember not the what multitude of thy
[2:02:33] mercy so what was Miracle was not really
[2:02:37] Miracle
[2:02:42] am everybody okay what you call Miracle
[2:02:46] God doesn't call that miracle God is
[2:02:49] calling that Mercy
[2:02:53] amen when you got sick and God heal you
[2:02:57] you calling that a miracle God is saying
[2:03:00] that is my
[2:03:01] mercy and he said Israel did not
[2:03:05] understand my mercy and don't even
[2:03:07] remember my
[2:03:10] Mercy listen my friend remember not the
[2:03:14] multitude of what thy mercies but
[2:03:17] provoke him at the what
[2:03:19] even at the what R sea how did they
[2:03:21] provoke
[2:03:23] God what happened at the sea because at
[2:03:26] the sea it's appearing like they are
[2:03:30] locked like they cannot go over and the
[2:03:33] Red Sea is blocking them and when they
[2:03:35] look this way the Wilderness when they
[2:03:38] look this way the mountain and they look
[2:03:40] behind them pharaoh and they begin to
[2:03:43] cry and God is saying that by doing that
[2:03:46] they provoke him in other words God God
[2:03:49] begin you begin to get in the nerve of
[2:03:54] Godus I'm saying that in plain word in
[2:03:57] other way you begin to trouble God how
[2:03:59] many time am I going to do something for
[2:04:01] you to
[2:04:04] understand everything I did in Egypt is
[2:04:08] to create a confidence to create a
[2:04:11] certainty to create an assurance that
[2:04:14] whatever you face in your road
[2:04:17] remember what I did
[2:04:20] yesterday understand what I did
[2:04:22] yesterday I am still the same God I can
[2:04:25] destroy whatever is in front of
[2:04:28] [Applause]
[2:04:32] you listen to brother Bram glory to God
[2:04:35] brother Bram say to misunderstand is not
[2:04:39] just it's it's just not to say well I
[2:04:42] didn't hear what he said that's right
[2:04:45] but to see something done and what
[2:04:49] misunderstand what it is for
[2:04:52] amen so when God do something if you
[2:04:56] don't understand what the purpose of
[2:04:59] what God is doing you are
[2:05:01] misunderstanding God and brother brother
[2:05:04] say that you are missing the water mark
[2:05:07] or completely them now God does not do
[2:05:11] Miracle just to say see I am
[2:05:17] God I want you to soak that in I want
[2:05:21] you to soak that in because we say God
[2:05:23] show your power show your power God
[2:05:26] doesn't show your power just to show
[2:05:27] your power to show his power but the
[2:05:29] problem I'm say God does not do Miracle
[2:05:33] just to say see I am God God does a
[2:05:37] miracle for what an understanding that's
[2:05:40] why he's telling Israel you didn't
[2:05:43] understand me I brought you into the
[2:05:45] Wilderness and humble you and gave you
[2:05:48] Mana I want you to understand me I want
[2:05:51] you to understand that I care amen that
[2:05:54] I am your father am that I'm responsible
[2:05:57] for your
[2:05:58] life Oh Glory to God it's going to
[2:06:02] change your way of praying my friend he
[2:06:05] says God does a miracle for what
[2:06:08] understanding an understanding God does
[2:06:11] it for a what a purpose and did you
[2:06:13] notice the reading of the psalm here in
[2:06:16] the seventh chapter which we did Brother
[2:06:18] Bram say they did not understand why
[2:06:22] that God down where in Egypt performed
[2:06:25] this
[2:06:26] miracle he was trying to show them his
[2:06:30] what Mercy he was trying to get them to
[2:06:34] understand that he was what God in the
[2:06:37] in the
[2:06:40] what let's continue again he was trying
[2:06:43] to make them understand that what he was
[2:06:46] God in their midst so when God do
[2:06:49] something for your
[2:06:50] life God is not just showing off he's
[2:06:54] trying to tell you that I'm in the Mist
[2:06:56] amen I am in your life amen I got
[2:07:00] everything under control
[2:07:05] amen when he heal you he's telling you
[2:07:08] I'm there amen when he blesses you he's
[2:07:10] telling you I'm theread amen when he
[2:07:12] spay you from a car accident he's
[2:07:14] telling you I'm theread amen you need to
[2:07:17] understand God Amen
[2:07:18] [Applause]
[2:07:27] glory to God we are right here my
[2:07:31] friend glory to God can I continue I
[2:07:35] love that listen to brother Bram brother
[2:07:37] Bram say that is what God was doing to
[2:07:41] Israel you know he said as the water
[2:07:44] Eagle stir up her nest that is the same
[2:07:46] thing he found Israel where in a
[2:07:48] hallowing land down there he brought him
[2:07:51] up out of what Egypt and did what took
[2:07:53] him into the promised land on the what
[2:07:55] wings of an eagle and what was God doing
[2:07:58] this miracle he was trying to get his
[2:08:02] people that he was the water Mighty
[2:08:05] Jehovah that is what he's trying to do
[2:08:08] today
[2:08:11] amen are we together he just doesn't
[2:08:15] heal people just because he can heal
[2:08:20] my brother read that again in red he
[2:08:23] just what he maybe my English is
[2:08:25] complicated read in your English he just
[2:08:28] doesn't heal people just because he can
[2:08:30] heal he's trying to get you that he is
[2:08:34] what the resurrection that he can make
[2:08:36] you well he can raise your body he can
[2:08:40] do what whatever he wants he's Jehovah
[2:08:43] he can do whatever he wants to he is
[2:08:46] what Jehovah
[2:08:49] [Applause]
[2:08:51] so whatever God does in your life you
[2:08:54] need to understand and you need to
[2:08:57] remember because whatever he's doing
[2:09:00] he's trying to tell you I am with you I
[2:09:02] am standing with you I am protecting you

[2:22:49] every her bearing seed uhhuh stop God
[2:22:53] have given what every her bearing SE her
[2:22:56] doing what bearing seed for what which
[2:22:59] is upon the face of all the Earth for
[2:23:01] what and every tree and every tree and
[2:23:04] what in the which is the fruit of a tree
[2:23:07] uhhuh the fruit tree for what to to you
[2:23:10] it shall be for
[2:23:13] meat let me ask you question let's go
[2:23:16] slowly
[2:23:17] if you notice God is telling a Adam and
[2:23:22] Eve their
[2:23:24] diet am I am I reading a different Bible
[2:23:27] amen don't do me like this he's giving
[2:23:29] them a diet right and if you notice he
[2:23:33] use the word
[2:23:35] shall notice he said and shall be
[2:23:39] because man was still a
[2:23:42] spirit he cannot eat food yet but God
[2:23:47] already prepared
[2:23:48] food can I continue am he gave man his
[2:23:54] diet for the future because man was
[2:23:57] first a spirit amen and the diet he gave
[2:24:02] is seed and
[2:24:03] what and herbs and what fruits fruit and
[2:24:08] all of these were created before
[2:24:12] Adam so Adam came in into his food
[2:24:19] yes I don't know if you get what I'm
[2:24:21] saying Adam was born with his food when
[2:24:25] he was born his food was already there
[2:24:28] all that God has to do is indicate him
[2:24:30] which food to
[2:24:33] take he's a provider sir are we together
[2:24:38] he's a provider before you ask him he
[2:24:41] already provided he already
[2:24:43] stored he's not telling Adam that okay
[2:24:46] now since you are created I need to
[2:24:48] figure it out what can you eat no so
[2:24:50] when God was creating
[2:24:53] herb when he was creating fruit true
[2:24:56] fruit tree in his mind he was seeing
[2:25:00] Adam where is Adam go what is Adam going
[2:25:03] to eat wait wait wait wait before you
[2:25:04] created the fruit I will I I will bring
[2:25:07] uh a baby over there two babies make
[2:25:09] sure whatever you bring they it's going
[2:25:11] to be compatible with the digestive
[2:25:14] system can they have food okay okay so
[2:25:17] whenever God is creating in his back
[2:25:19] part man he have his
[2:25:22] children what do you think about
[2:25:25] you can I
[2:25:28] continue let's go to verse 30 my
[2:25:31] friend Ander every beast of the earth to
[2:25:34] who Beast every Beast this food this
[2:25:37] diet was for Adam and who and
[2:25:42] Eve this verse 30 he says he's creating
[2:25:46] something for who
[2:25:47] for for every what beast of the Earth
[2:25:50] every beast of the earth and who to
[2:25:52] every foul of the air and foul of the
[2:25:54] air and what else and to everything that
[2:25:57] creepeth upon the earth and the creeping
[2:25:58] thing and the creeping thing what
[2:26:01] wherein there is life uhhuh and what
[2:26:03] else I have given every green herb for
[2:26:05] Meat Stop he gave them
[2:26:09] what for what for me and what else it
[2:26:13] will so so God not only provided for
[2:26:22] human can I continue can I continue
[2:26:26] you're going to see the level of this
[2:26:27] provider he didn't provide food only for
[2:26:30] Adam and Eve but he provide food for the
[2:26:34] Beast amen for the foul and for the
[2:26:37] creeping
[2:26:40] things are we together amen are we
[2:26:43] together amen are we together
[2:26:45] amen
[2:26:47] why is God doing
[2:26:50] this listen to Paul in book of 2
[2:26:53] Corinthians chapter 12 Paul says behold
[2:26:57] the third time I'm ready to come to you
[2:27:00] and I will not be Bome to you for a Seck
[2:27:04] not what yours but what you for the
[2:27:08] children what ought not to lay up for
[2:27:10] the parents that's right amen can you
[2:27:13] say amen amen can you say amen amen can
[2:27:16] say amen amen so when we working as a
[2:27:19] parent we need to lay stuff for our
[2:27:21] children
[2:27:23] a can you say can you verify your

[2:27:40] children ought not to lay up for the
[2:27:42] what parents but who the parents for the
[2:27:45] children
[2:27:48] hallah so every parent must lay feeds
[2:27:52] for their
[2:27:53] children if your children are sleeping
[2:27:56] outside it's your
[2:27:57] fault if food is not in the table it's
[2:28:00] your fault it is not the fault of the
[2:28:03] children the children are dependent in
[2:28:07] your taxes you put
[2:28:12] dependent and you are the head of the
[2:28:15] household but they are the dependent and
[2:28:17] it's a principle every parent must lay
[2:28:21] things for their what children because
[2:28:23] we are responsible
[2:28:26] amen if you don't have enough money
[2:28:29] don't bring them
[2:28:32] [Applause]
[2:28:34] forth do you follow me do you follow me
[2:28:38] that's why before you get married
[2:28:41] brother want to make sure a man has a
[2:28:45] job
[2:28:48] because you must provide for your family
[2:28:51] you must provide for your family you
[2:28:53] need to provide a shelter their clothing
[2:28:57] their food it is your
[2:29:00] [Applause]

[2:29:20] leave the sister alone we need men that
[2:29:24] are responsible because the desire of
[2:29:27] your wife shall go to
[2:29:30] you if you are not sufficient back up my
[2:29:35] friend marriage is not just
[2:29:38] sex it is more than
[2:29:42] sex
[2:29:45] am
[2:29:51] Adam and Eve live after the marriage
[2:29:55] without sex the one who introduced the
[2:29:58] sex is the devil So Adam and Eve were
[2:30:01] living without sex and they were eating
[2:30:03] without sex so marriage is not just sex
[2:30:06] it's about
[2:30:08] [Applause]
[2:30:12] responsibility I wish I can shake Boys
[2:30:15] in this message
[2:30:17] and get them away from craziness of
[2:30:20] dancing dancing dancing around Stop
[2:30:22] Dancing go back to

[2:30:28] work have a decent job for your
[2:30:32] [Applause]

[2:30:40] on a hot potato seat my friend but I
[2:30:43] have no choices amen it is a respon
[2:30:46] responsibility it is a principle for
[2:30:48] parent to lay down for their what and
[2:30:52] God being a
[2:30:56] parent God being a parent must be the
[2:31:00] first example and as the first parent he
[2:31:03] first laid down for his
[2:31:07] [Applause]
[2:31:14] children you don't lay down things only
[2:31:18] for them to
[2:31:20] enjoy your responsibility goes even when
[2:31:23] they make
[2:31:25] mistake because when Adam and Eve made
[2:31:28] mistake God came with the
[2:31:31] [Applause]
[2:31:34] medication so God was a Healer before
[2:31:37] Adam and Eve got sick God was a savior
[2:31:40] before his children fell so when his
[2:31:43] children fa he doesn't impress God God
[2:31:46] just bring the medication and kill a
[2:31:48] lamb and take care of the situation
[2:31:51] marriage have a big
[2:31:53] responsibility not just providing food
[2:31:56] but to take care even in their
[2:32:01] mistake everybody okay everybody good

[2:57:44] purpose God is telling you something
[2:57:47] that I'm with you he's teaching you
[2:57:50] something he want you to understand and

[2:58:17] something you are upset all the time
[2:58:19] because you worry worry worry too much
[2:58:22] it the miracle of God is to take tension

[2:58:42] to lay down for the children and God
[2:58:44] laid down everything on Calvary that's
[2:58:47] it that's why the scripture say how can
[2:58:49] he not give you freely all things that's
