========================================

faith is not by sight god don't tell you everything trust in the lord in all thy ways and lean not to your own understanding he will lead he will die he will direct your path is that right seek the lord and all thy things you know thy ways and and they do what and acknowledge him is that right not acknowledge him as the lord no matter what nobody try to lift you up thank the lord my brother thank the lord my sister to god be the glory is that right hallelujah we're moving into something saints look what he says he said in a statue you can't walk in it unless god give you the holy ghost for you to be a witness it also is a witness you're also a testimony is that right hallelujah let me keep reading he said and i'm just and i hadn't gotten near to it but that's okay god's having his way he said now look he says and then after god found the they have to found abraham to be faithful to the promise that god gave him that he would have had the child and through this child all the earth would be blessed then god confirmed his faith by giving him a sign and that sign was what circumcision is that right and circumcision is the type of the what holy spirit is that right it's a circumcision where god has to circumcise your heart and god's got to get all that filth out of that heart is that right you got to come love thy god with all thy heart and all thy mind and all thy soul and all thy strength is that right and my wife know the only time she gonna get me for this but after 45 years she ain't she not going anywhere but i got around there only time oh only time i give her that face i'm gonna be honest with you now only time i give her that look is when i'm in there with the lord when i'm in the presence of the lord there's nothing like just being with the lord is that right i'm sure she feel the same way would she have a private time when she's with the lord is that right it's no presence there's nothing like just being with the lord you can't explain it it's a supernatural but once you invite them in when you practice you pray once you environment when you study it once you invite them in it's a presence that cannot be explained look what he says he says just the very text said the very next verse let me drop down he says the circumcision is a type of the holy ghost he says and god gave abram and god gave abraham the circumcision he said after after he had accepted god on his promise and walked out into the strange country it was a sign see what is it saints the holy ghost you receive it by faith it's simple it's not it's just by faith the seed is already in he you not have built the statute of a perfect man if the faith seed is not already there it has to receive so that's why we're moving into another dispensation that's why we're getting what we're getting we thank god for lutheran age we thank god for wesley age we thank god for the pentecostal age but you're going to see imma read some this is greater than that saying yes sir brother c is greater than that is that right hallelujah because he was because of his grace and his mercy he loved us so dearly we had to take you're not going to convince me certain ones up in here again didn't take persecution to take great persecution to get here but it took obedience it took humility it took praying it took science it take trying to take moving into what god has brought you in maybe perhaps i heard his sister say you tried to sing there in the world you know what no no no no no no you know what they used to call whitney houston in the world the voice you you you have the voice [Music] when they move into your position you'll see what i'm talking about you have the voice god halfway through nothing and god has brought what he has brought in here for the end time is that right because you got done see you know when you play basketball it is it's a different you got to get someone to that gift is that right but that gives you have to be trained you know when you're over there and some of y'all maybe went out for basketball whatever you know first when the coach is standing there i'm just giving you a powerful example they look at that person and they recognize right there's a gift he already has a vision god already has chosen you huh you have already been procrastinated you see so the coach stands there when the coach stands there he gets there and he says okay somebody make the first cut is that right now you got another second cut is that right maybe you see you say he's still watching that gift he's seeing something in there that i can use maybe to lead me to a championship he sees something there that's going to ring me there so then you make the final cut now after the final cut what it is he had drills the coach had drills to see your skills is that right now once you make the team man he's got drills to sharpen your skills to bring you up to get ready for the trial is that right god now is opening the word is that right the third pull is the opening of the word is that what the holy ghost said the opening of the word the only thing left is what brother you going home is that right nobody knows that secret hallelujah and what did he tell us you're going to run across these spirits god just don't give it to you no he said what what brother prophet of god said seven seal was a mystery the hidden things belong to god but once he revealed that it belongs to me the holy ghost told me last wednesday he only spoke that when he was speaking of going home is that right nobody knows the time is that right so god unfolded that so you'll be able to help somebody not to fight nobody not to combat nobody the brother but the lord showed us is that now going when he mentioned that seven seals was not being open is that now is because nobody knows the coming of the lord but god is that right see he's giving you a weapon to set somebody free maybe somebody is stuck right in that area on this message do you see what i'm saying but god will not be mocked he said he's not going to lose not a one saints hallelujah i mean it sister sing like you never sang before get yourself consecrated you get this time we got war we didn't set war against the devil is that right how are you sending them out turn the second chrono turn there i think it's second chronicles 20. that's the scripture that come to me help me lord this is not a play play last time when we was here the armies were setting the ray river right i mean they was getting in order but david he recognized david was the atheist is that right david had a four son he was the eighth son he came in there by him being in there david recognized david was representing that bride at the time he had the fullness at that time he went against goliath the prophet that god preached the greatest battle ever fought the greatest battle ever fought was the mind the devil is the bluff is that right we the jesus christ defeated him on cal brad and he came in there boasting that david but remember when the goliath came to david he was the champion of the champion but he recognize that david had god with him david had the experiences with him that god came and met him when he was out there in the woods he came to take one of the sheep uh by the lion and the bear but david wasn't going for it you're uncircumcised philistines [Music] you come to defile the army of the living god god had given us a ministry to tie the tie in all the loose things that's why he sends the ribbon ball that right he sent malachi 4. luke 17 30. he sent him in his hour here now wasn't just any angel feeding him he wasn't the angel of luther it wasn't an angel with it it was christ revelations 10 1 was coming down to revelations 10 7 feeding that angel down there bringing him the hidden part bringing him the loose ends the clouds come on sanchez we are the the happiest people in the world already be that god second chronicles 20 let's see for the sake of time second chronicles 20 and let's look at uh 20. he says and they rose early in the morning and went for and went forth into the wilderness and tikka as they went forth jehoshaphat stood and he said hear me o judah oh i'm loving judah now and ye in the habits of jerusalem believe in the lord your god so shall be established believe his prophet sir so shall ye what prosperous he says and when he had consulted with the people he appointed what he appointed what let me hear the singer say he appointed what ah god appointed you god appointed you for this battle god sent two musicians out for this battle god did it evil just relax pray sing the song to jesus christ let them come and anoint you for the glory of god he said now in the lord the singers and to the lord and that should praise the beauty of what holiness that they went out before the army and said and to say praise the lord he says for his what mercy endured forever and when they began to what into what the lord said what they say what we need you to sing us you're ambushed see when you get down what you say brother see when you get down in the valley and when amalek thinks that you're down now when amalek thinks that you're low he says the blood whoa the blood the blood don't sign my name you're defeated when you're in that valley sing praises lift him up it confounds the enemy look what he says he says and when they began to sink and to praise the lord said ambush who set the ambush he cannot set an ambush why you think he had the pastor in that area he had he cannot set the ambush is that right because he always got the people through music remember nebuchadnezzar the first thing he did he said when you hear me play the music you start dancing you see them today right some of them like chickens see a chicken in the yard looking for scraps didn't see no ego down there huh that's what they do as soon as they play that music the boom the spirit starts you see what i'm saying demon forces is all out there you got 200 million demons loose right now how do i know right but we got to what the power of the holy ghost the powers say cast down every imagination and try to exalt itself against the word of god is that right huh no weapons formed against you shall prosper when the enemy come in like a flood god should do what lift up a mighty standard hallelujah [Music] he says in ambush the children of who emma moaz mountain syria which would come against judah and they were what smith see what praises and singing do he's sending out the singers in them first hallelujah let me keep reading lord help us lord he said now look it's a sign he says all and all his children and his seed after him should have this sign in their flesh because it was a distinction it was the separation them from all other peoples this the sign of the circumcision the sign with us you are different if there if you didn't have the circumcision under the under the law i think you've got to you could write it down i think it's a uh uh genesis 17 and maybe around genesis 17 and he talks about if you didn't have the circumcision you guys you couldn't even have fellowship he ain't separated see if they don't have what we have in this hour here now how can you fellowship with them how are you looking back with them a ego and a budget cannot fellowship together saints is just that close i'm telling you we've got testimonies we got testimonies out there and we're as assuming that god is answering people prayers calling on the name of the lord jesus christ when he's out there people's getting delivered from the kovic simple natural simple natural things are happening brother robert just because of people praying just because the people are are continuing sighing and crying for the condition of this land they know that the sickness or the diseases cannot come upon us because not only we have a promise is that right he said that i would leave and guide you into all truth is that right let me keep reading because i want to get to some some things help me lord he says now he says and all he says and that's what god uses today it's the sign of circumcision of the what of the heart we went into ezekiel 36 on that he says in the holy spirit that makes god's church you see a separated church from all other creeds and faiths and denominations they're in all kinds of denominations but yet they are a separate people god's people as a separate people of course we know god called us out of that system long time ago is that right so now we just look and continue looking good to catch one here and catch one over there because god is soon to come he's not going to allow us to just continue to keep going on this way some people want things to get back to normal but what they want to get back to normal says sinful life that's not normal that's a sin for life that's all they want to get back to and god's not going to tolerate it and god is sick of his foolishness right now they're dealing with an angry god they're dealing with a god that that's about to bring his judgment on these folks around him now he already told us the prophet of god in the end time evangelism message you ought to go listen to it and see what we're up against in this end time i'm telling you guys that that royal church that they call out there now they're speaking like a false prophet oh god and so we got to understand now what the lord is bringing us into just bear with me saints i'm gonna have to jump a little bit he said now he said now not pattern he says uh not pattern today that today persons who refuse to receive the baptism of the holy ghost can have no fellowship among those that has the holy ghost you just can't do it you see i'm going to jump because i want you i want to bring you i don't want to leave you back in there i want to bring you up to just in time over can you see right here 16 help me lord it says yeah in time let's look at some things here see why the lord have us where he has us he said back in the early days when the things was was wide wide away luther taught justification but just like the holy spirit said to brother steve you couldn't good the fullness in that time luther didn't have the footage he had that portion because what he smoked the pipe god honored him smoking a pipe and i think they drank beer but look let us move on but the holy spirit was still there now there's a portion of it he said now look back in the early days when the thing was wide away and luther taught the justification by faith he said that was just to bring the people from catholicism to into politicism he says in the fellowship around the word he said justification by faith that was a big wise spirit he says they never moved from that see he says along came another revival with john wesley it shook them down from brought her from down to sanctification still with me she was brother now those that was in luther that got stuck with luther didn't have fellowship with wesley here with me because they brought them with this sanctification he said now look he says but give joy in your heart that's all it could give you that shook off a lot of lutherans he says then along come pentecost with the baptism of the holy ghost and narrowed it down again by receiving what the holy ghost that's right he says and now that's beginning to shake down he said and the gifts and the restoration and the spirit of god has come in the fullness of the signs and wonders into the church and has shook pentecost see what is it we're so close to coming of the lord jesus until the very spirit that was in him is working in the church he says doing he's doing the very same thing that he did when he was on earth it's never been anywhere back from the time of the apostles he says until what until now remember now what is he's doing now showing that is in the church he's opening the word is that right it's the opening of the word he's bringing around in here until now that's her third pull right now we got one more thing i want to read to you god help me he says now and wesley after luther he says on down through the age it comes as soon as one revival is over god raises up another and throws more and what but he brings more light just keeps moving like that see it doesn't stop he says now we're at the end musicians you can come on up please he says now we're at the end of this time each man has looked at the end of his junction for the coming of christ he says but they had a lot to look forward to the returning of the jews flying saucers in the sky because we know they were investigating angels he says all the things that we see today but we are at the end it says we are here they they know the church was to receive power that would work in the church the same works of christ because as the shadow becomes deeper and deeper and reflects more you take a shadow i'm a drop down he says now now the spirit of god has worked under the justification on the luther sanctification on the wesley the baptism of the holy ghost on the pentecost and here it is in what the last days you see what you're getting come on now performing and doing the very same thing that it did when it was in christ what is it the church and christ has become one again he said see it's christ here it's christ opening those scriptures it's christ's unveiling those mystery it's christ doing it again when they was on the road to the mayor's what was she doing he was opening the scriptures they looking for something comparing it to pentecost but they're missing it this is greater than pentagon [Music] [Applause] he said now look he said and as soon as they as soon as they connect together as soon as we connect together that last link she'll go through the sky shouting up will come wesley up will come luther and all the rest of them back in those days he hears that first will be last and the last shall be first we are at the end listen that's what the holy ghost does the holy ghost by justification see just a light shadow the holy ghost the holy ghost by sanctification a little deeper shadow the holy ghost by the restoration of this very person being in here forming signs and oneness and like he did at the beginning glory going to call me a holy role anyway hallelujah god is now opening the word they're looking for something and they're misunderstanding the movement of the holy ghost let us stand hallelujah come on brother brother anybody name any prayer i didn't even touch it saying maybe we could keep on going later on i didn't even touch it but what is the holy ghost the holy ghost [Music] and also to have a doctor's visit [Music] do do [Music] do [Music] do hallelujah lord god we thank you for your grace your mercy follow
