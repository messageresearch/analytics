[3:19] message about the youth
[3:21] brothers young brothers meeting coming

[3:25] did you receive the message
[3:26] somebody said no
[3:28] did you receive it
[3:30] somebody here says no make sure your

[3:43] i have not received any question yet it
[3:45] looks like everybody knows everything
[3:48] [Laughter]
[3:50] i have not received any questions yet so
[3:52] i'm just assuming are you waiting for
[3:54] that day to give me your question
[3:58] and i'm to have 10 questions in one time
[4:01] so you better do it a little bit earlier
[4:04] and send it to me so we can see what is
[4:06] going on in your mind that you want to
[4:08] talk privately and we can talk to you as
[4:11] a pastor as a friend as a big brother
[4:16] as a family member
[4:18] so nobody is in the court or in a trial
[4:22] like somebody will see me like oh i'm
[4:24] still struggling with this
[4:27] i'm not going to tell anybody oh no way
[4:29] you keep it you're going to blow up
[4:31] yourself amen
[4:32] everybody up to date
[4:34] we're good
[4:35] yeah brother john mentioned something
[4:37] about the music here all we want to do
[4:40] is make sure everything is in perfect
[4:43] order
[4:44] amen we encourage you to sing but some
[4:47] of the time you need parent or you need
[4:49] somebody a little bit mature to check
[4:51] the music and to make sure the source
[4:54] are good amen
[4:55] when i pray when we preach here by the
[4:57] high heel
[4:59] we're not preaching high heel to you
[5:01] only somebody's laughing already
[5:04] we're preaching high heel first to show
[5:06] you
[5:07] what is the spirit behind high heel so
[5:09] when you understand the spirit behind
[5:11] high heel if you're doing it you need to
[5:13] stop
[5:14] and not only that but you get also
[5:16] discernment
[5:18] of the sermon that you get
[5:20] so when you're looking at the christian
[5:23] singer you can look at the picture only
[5:26] that they're putting on the album
[5:28] when you just look at the picture
[5:31] if you see them wearing long high heels
[5:33] long nail like this makeup all these
[5:36] kind of stuff all of those should be
[5:38] giving you signal
[5:40] of the life behind the singer
[5:43] the word might be good but what is the
[5:46] life behind the singer
[5:48] amen
[5:49] somebody who took a picture body part
[5:51] hanging out or things like that
[5:53] automatically your discernment by the
[5:55] word should pop up and say something is
[5:57] wrong right here
[5:59] amen so when we preach about
[6:01] how long your dress should be your skirt
[6:04] and everything if you're still
[6:06] struggling with those things i'm not
[6:08] gonna stop
[6:10] i will preach it until we go to the
[6:13] rapture
[6:14] until everybody stop wearing it
[6:17] amen
[6:18] you can keep doing it i'm not going to
[6:19] stop too
[6:21] so if you want me to move to deeper
[6:23] ground you stop what you're doing so we
[6:25] keep climbing higher amen
[6:28] in other words brother branham said the
[6:30] difference between paul
[6:32] and the pentecostal preacher he said
[6:34] paul when he preaches one he will stay
[6:37] with him
[6:38] until that person received the holy
[6:40] spirit so it's not just preaching and we
[6:43] go
[6:45] no because i will be surprised you see
[6:48] this is why you see people 25 years in
[6:50] the message and no changes
[6:53] because the sermon get here and out what
[6:55] is the next
[6:57] what is the next that's not the case
[7:00] when the sermon comes it's the lord
[7:02] bringing his grace to judge not you but
[7:06] to judge the stuff that you're
[7:07] struggling in life so you need to stop
[7:10] and examine yourself what am i doing
[7:13] am i doing what has been preached what
[7:16] can i correct here then you correct it
[7:18] and once you correct it you are growing
[7:20] into the lord but we cannot preach a
[7:23] high heel and we preach this and we
[7:25] preach this and we preach and you're
[7:26] still struggling with something down
[7:28] there so it means your experience is not
[7:31] quite correct we need to go back to
[7:33] ground zero let's go back to the altar
[7:36] and make sure you have the holy spirit
[7:38] amen if not you're gonna leave this
[7:41] church right here and before you know it
[7:42] you start wearing paints it shows that
[7:45] you never believed before don't tell me
[7:47] you were believing before no no the holy
[7:50] spirit you can't stay in one place you
[7:52] always want to move and move and move
[7:54] and grow so what we're preaching to you
[7:57] need to go in your heart
[7:58] and he needs to change you
[8:01] so you need to look and lash here when
[8:03] we started here in this church where was
[8:05] i at where am i at today if you're not
[8:09] changing something is wrong
[8:11] if they preach about makeup five
[8:13] five months and you're still doing the
[8:15] same thing something is wrong don't fool
[8:17] yourself
[8:18] because i receive messages
[8:21] what you're putting on facebook i
[8:22] receive them
[8:24] was it yesterday somebody
[8:25] sent me something and if you look at
[8:27] what people are posting you wonder if
[8:30] they were even born again
[8:33] be leaving the message for years and put
[8:35] it up right there on social media
[8:38] before you put something stop and think
[8:43] not think about what is going to please
[8:45] brother stephen no pre to think about
[8:47] the word that was being preached here
[8:49] what i'm putting up here is he honoring
[8:52] me is he honoring my father
[8:56] is he honoring mama is he bringing
[8:58] respect to my family is he bringing
[9:00] respect to my church is he bringing
[9:02] respect to my personality
[9:05] that's what you need to look at you're
[9:08] not there to entertain people
[9:14] i told you i'm not going to stop
[9:16] you not dare you not here in this world
[9:20] to entertain people
[9:23] the people don't sit in their home
[9:25] trying to entertain you why are you the
[9:27] one entertaining them
[9:29] you buy a new car you have to post it
[9:31] why
[9:32] do they post their
[9:34] car why you keep doing it
[9:37] what is wrong what are you seeking for
[9:40] what are you looking for
[9:43] why you can't go two days without
[9:45] posting something
[9:49] why don't you post things that are
[9:51] edifying people
[9:54] because david used the same sword of
[9:56] goliath and kill him with it
[10:01] why don't you post something like maybe
[10:03] what brother branham say what the words
[10:05] say something that somebody opened and
[10:07] see
[10:08] versus your face we already seen you a
[10:10] lot
[10:20] that's your pastor right
[10:23] so don't make him fall out of yourself
[10:25] up there
[10:26] respect yourself we know you we're good
[10:29] you're beautiful
[10:30] all of that we already know you're
[10:32] beautiful you super you the head of
[10:35] everybody no woman look like you we
[10:37] already know about it
[10:41] give us some good news
[10:48] ouch
[10:52] ah
[10:53] you got quite a pastor
[10:55] let's go to genesis chapter 15
[10:58] you hate me no problem i pray for you
[11:02] in heaven you will be hugging me thank
[11:04] you so much
[11:06] say after a lot of headaches
[11:15] if you study languages you'll be afraid
[11:18] what you're doing
[11:20] somebody can just look at you and
[11:21] understand a lot of stuff and you think
[11:23] you're fooling them
[11:25] and when they want to get married
[11:27] somebody said not that one
[11:30] they won't tell you
[11:31] go to that one
[11:33] and you keep seeing people
[11:35] using when they see you they exit and
[11:37] they see you they exit why are everybody
[11:39] exiting when you see me watch what
[11:41] you're doing
[11:43] get all the foolishness out
[11:46] amen
[11:47] and somebody look and say i've never
[11:49] seen her she's different i've never seen
[11:52] her behaving like this
[11:54] then
[11:54] somebody's interested on what makes her
[11:57] different
[11:59] then you attracted somebody because your
[12:01] life is pulling
[12:02] amen
[12:05] don't copy after the world
[12:07] so when you look at album you look at
[12:09] the singer look at the singer
[12:11] before you go to the word stop the word
[12:13] look at them
[12:15] look at how they dress
[12:17] what are they trying to do
[12:19] are they trying to dance
[12:21] are they trying to
[12:22] copy a rock-and-roll move
[12:25] or a hip-hop move
[12:27] what are they doing
[12:30] is the singer projecting himself
[12:33] or is the singer really worshipping god
[12:36] when you begin to look at things like
[12:38] that you can detect something say yes
[12:41] because you go to hell there is a lot of
[12:43] people with beautiful voices in hell a
[12:46] lot of them
[12:47] brother brother i'm saying holy would
[12:48] enter the church through singers
[12:51] amen
[12:52] so you hear the word for you first apply
[12:55] it to your life then that word became
[12:57] also a filter to help you detect the
[13:00] devil where it's going on amen
[13:03] but don't just copy and put it up here
[13:06] copy and put it up here you'll be tired
[13:08] my friend
[13:09] you'll be tired anyway we're gonna have
[13:11] some time to talk together with the
[13:13] sister with the brother so we can talk
[13:16] more clear amen
[13:17] blessed be the name of the lord genesis
[13:20] chapter 15 verse five everybody up to
[13:23] date with the sermon
[13:25] amen
[13:26] okay you lag behind it's not my fault
[13:29] if you're there you can say amen
[13:32] lord help us hallelujah
[13:34] verse 5
[13:37] and he brought him forth abroad
[13:40] god told abraham come out
[13:42] and say look now toward heaven
[13:46] and tell the stars if you'll be able to
[13:49] number them
[13:50] and he said to him
[13:52] so shall your seed
[13:54] be you might be seated
[13:56] so you know the story you know the
[13:58] background god was talking to abraham he
[14:01] say abraham
[14:02] i am your shield i am your great you see
[14:04] the great reward abraham look at him he
[14:07] say okay you're blessing me you're doing
[14:09] all these things but i don't have a
[14:11] child
[14:12] god said come up here let's go outside
[14:15] look over there can you number the start
[14:16] no that's the way your seed is gonna be
[14:19] amen
[14:20] so in other words god gave abraham a
[14:23] promise ready
[14:25] anybody clear
[14:27] now what did abraham do when god gave
[14:29] him a promise
[14:31] verse 6
[14:32] and he did what
[14:36] he believed in the lord
[14:40] and he counted it god counted it to him
[14:44] for water
[14:46] so in genesis chapter 15
[14:50] the scripture is talking about the faith
[14:53] of abraham toward god
[14:55] the element that is brought here is
[14:58] abraham believed
[15:00] amen by believing
[15:03] god
[15:04] pull his seal and say
[15:06] you were righteous
[15:10] just believing they didn't say
[15:13] abraham did this this no
[15:16] just by believing god pull up the seal
[15:19] and say abraham be righteous
[15:23] amen
[15:24] let's go to genesis chapter 17
[15:28] believing faith
[15:30] righteousness
[15:32] now genesis 17 we talk about it god told
[15:35] abraham hey
[15:36] walk before me and be what
[15:39] perfect everybody clear
[15:41] verse 1 and when abraham was 90 years
[15:44] old and 9 99 the lord appeared to abram
[15:48] and said to him i am the almighty god
[15:52] walk before me and be there
[15:54] you understand that now
[15:56] and i will make because perfection you
[15:58] must watch your word
[16:00] right watch your mouth and i will make
[16:02] my covenant between me and you and will
[16:05] multiply you exceedingly and abraham
[16:08] fell on his face and god talked with him
[16:11] saying
[16:12] as for me behold my covenant is with you
[16:16] and you shall be a father of many
[16:19] nations everybody so far
[16:23] verse 5
[16:24] neither your name
[16:27] anymore be called abraham but your name
[16:30] shall be abraham
[16:32] for a father of many nations have i made
[16:36] you in genesis 15 he said look at your
[16:40] children
[16:41] without numbers
[16:42] now in genesis 17 he said a father of
[16:46] many nations all we know is abraham did
[16:49] what he just believed god
[16:52] how did abraham believe
[16:55] how
[16:59] so he just said
[17:00] accepted how did he believe
[17:05] let's go to romans chapter four
[17:09] at the opening of the seventh seal the
[17:12] bible became a new book
[17:14] let's go to genesis
[17:17] roman four i'm sorry verse 17
[17:20] because we we usually repeat things and
[17:23] abraham believe god and abra stop stop
[17:25] slow down how did abraham believe
[17:29] [Music]
[17:32] because in the old testament they never
[17:34] talk about janice and chambers
[17:37] they only say the magician
[17:40] how many four three eight we don't know
[17:43] it took paul
[17:45] in the new testament
[17:47] to enter the old testament and say there
[17:50] were two
[17:51] and their name are janice and james you
[17:54] can go all around the old testament you
[17:57] don't know what the name are not so now
[18:00] when you take paul
[18:02] and when you take moses you put them
[18:04] together now you begin to see a clear
[18:06] picture
[18:08] if you only take moses you will say
[18:10] there were magicians that we stood moses
[18:14] that's all you can talk but when you
[18:16] take paul your story changed
[18:20] you would say there were two magicians
[18:23] that withstood moses and their name are
[18:27] janice and generous now the story is
[18:30] different
[18:31] in the old testament moses said abraham
[18:34] went and give that to melchizedek that's
[18:37] all you know
[18:38] but when you take paul you say not only
[18:41] abraham gave time liver who was in the
[18:44] launch of abraham also gave that then
[18:48] something else open up now you
[18:50] understand more now oh now understand
[18:53] why delivered we're giving the
[18:55] priesthood now understand what now
[18:57] everything begin to get clear about here
[19:01] so romans chapter 4 verse 17
[19:04] as it is written
[19:05] i have made you a father of many
[19:09] that's genesis 17. anybody clear now
[19:12] before him
[19:15] whom he did what
[19:17] that's genesis
[19:18] 15. everybody clear
[19:23] it's a surgery of the scripture
[19:25] even who god
[19:28] who makes a laughter dead
[19:31] so abraham didn't believe just god
[19:37] because god is a no an object of worship
[19:40] abraham believe a god
[19:43] that quickened the dead
[19:48] am i reading a different bible
[19:50] the bible says that before him whom he
[19:54] believes
[19:56] even who god what kind of god did you
[19:59] believe
[20:00] [Music]
[20:01] you believe god which god
[20:06] a god that we pure a god that strikes
[20:09] you a god there is many attributes in
[20:11] god
[20:12] what kind of god are you believing
[20:15] the bible says now even god come out who
[20:18] is giving you an explanation of that god
[20:21] a god who makes a love there
[20:24] in other words abraham believed the god
[20:27] of resurrection
[20:31] not just a god
[20:33] but a god of resurrection
[20:36] a god that can take something that is
[20:38] dead and bring it back again to life
[20:44] a god that can take a heart that is dead
[20:47] with a heart attack and quicken the
[20:50] heart again a god that can take a brain
[20:52] that was dead and quicken that brain
[20:54] again a god that can take a man who had
[20:57] a stroke
[20:58] and quickened down men and that men
[21:00] receive life again
[21:05] [Applause]
[21:06] a god that you can cut somebody else's
[21:09] ear
[21:10] and amputate somebody and he pick up the
[21:13] ear and put it back again and everything
[21:16] works
[21:18] without a scar
[21:20] that is the god abraham believe in
[21:23] not just god
[21:28] a specific god
[21:30] [Applause]
[21:35] hallelujah
[21:36] even god who makes a love there dead
[21:40] indeed what
[21:42] now abraham calls those things which be
[21:46] not as though there
[21:48] so here in genesis 15
[21:52] abraham all they say is he just believed
[21:56] they didn't tell us what abraham did in
[21:59] reaction
[22:00] to what he believed
[22:02] but now paul begin to give us more
[22:05] insight
[22:06] that when they told abraham abraham
[22:08] never stopped quiet
[22:10] he didn't just believe and that's it
[22:13] but when abraham believed he begin to
[22:16] call
[22:18] [Music]
[22:20] so here it saw it's not only faith
[22:24] but in roman
[22:25] we're talking now about abraham's
[22:28] confession
[22:33] now we begin to get the picture
[22:36] abraham believe god okay that same how
[22:38] did he believe god
[22:40] [Music]
[22:42] how
[22:43] how
[22:45] abraham didn't stay quiet
[22:49] when god told abraham something abraham
[22:53] open his mouth
[22:57] [Music]
[23:00] amen hallelujah
[23:02] and call those things which be not
[23:05] as though there
[23:07] so even if something doesn't exist
[23:10] abraham can look and say
[23:13] i believe there is a flower here
[23:17] then tomorrow you see abraham you say i
[23:19] still believe there is a flower here
[23:21] where is the flower i don't see
[23:23] who brought the flower i don't see did
[23:25] somebody give you a flower no all i
[23:28] believe there is a flower here
[23:32] hallelujah
[23:34] verse 18
[23:36] who against water
[23:38] when they say against hope
[23:40] brother one i'm saying it means there
[23:42] was not even hope
[23:45] sometimes we have hope
[23:48] you look at the situation
[23:50] i'm stuck here
[23:52] but i know if i go see the pastor
[23:55] he can help me
[23:56] that's a hope
[23:58] i know i don't have food but if i go see
[24:00] sister edie she said he would give me
[24:02] food
[24:03] that's hope
[24:04] but abraham that was not even an option
[24:08] there was not an option that i can go to
[24:10] the bank and apply and get a loan and
[24:14] solve that it was no hope
[24:16] zero
[24:18] against hope
[24:20] zero hey marquee
[24:22] against hope believe in water
[24:25] which hope was he believing on
[24:28] because there was no hope
[24:31] amen
[24:32] that he might become
[24:35] the father of many
[24:37] nations
[24:39] according to that which was spoken so
[24:41] shall your seed be that was genesis 15.
[24:46] in genesis 15 this is how your seed will
[24:48] be genesis 17
[24:50] father of many nations paul is now
[24:52] mixing the two genesis
[24:55] okay he's taking genesis 15 and 17 and
[24:58] he's mixing it anybody clear
[25:01] verse 19
[25:04] and being not weak in water
[25:08] in faith
[25:10] he considered not his own body now dead
[25:15] so now you understand why there was no
[25:17] hope for him
[25:18] because his body was dead
[25:21] that's why he have to believe in the god
[25:24] of resurrection
[25:29] [Music]
[25:30] everybody clear
[25:32] when he was about a hundred years old
[25:35] about a hundred because the scripture
[25:37] said nandina
[25:39] everybody here
[25:41] neither yet the deadness of sarah's
[25:44] water
[25:45] so sarah dead abraham dead when you
[25:49] approach a god when you're dead you must
[25:52] pull a certain attribute from that god
[25:57] i want to face you as a god of
[26:00] resurrection because something is in me
[26:02] is dead
[26:06] if it's financial struggle i want to
[26:09] approach you as the son of prosperity
[26:16] oh my god
[26:18] verse 20 he staggered not
[26:22] at the promise of god true
[26:25] unbelief
[26:29] but was strong in water
[26:32] doing water
[26:36] giving glory to her
[26:38] so when abraham received the promise he
[26:40] had challenges
[26:44] and back here
[26:46] his own body was his enemy
[26:50] when he woke up in the morning his body
[26:52] was reminding him that you are old
[26:57] when he looked at his wife his wife's
[26:59] body was reminding abraham that you are
[27:02] old you cannot have a child but abraham
[27:07] did not look at that
[27:08] [Music]
[27:09] [Applause]
[27:11] anybody here
[27:12] abraham was rising up in the morning
[27:15] giving glory to god
[27:20] [Music]
[27:25] when they say
[27:28] he staggered not at the promise of god
[27:31] the way we are trained we if they bring
[27:34] abraham today
[27:36] all of you will say
[27:37] wow father abraham
[27:39] you're a superman so god told you
[27:41] something you just believe like this
[27:43] ah how did you do it that's not the way
[27:46] it is
[27:50] amen
[27:51] when they told you moses was speaking
[27:53] you would look at moses maybe when you
[27:55] go to heaven you'll fall down you say
[27:57] moses
[27:58] it's you oh my god what a man
[28:05] brother branham said in perfect world
[28:07] strength he said
[28:09] we are very grateful
[28:11] that we still have a kind heavenly
[28:14] father
[28:15] who looks over our
[28:18] our mistake and does not welcome them to
[28:21] us
[28:26] okay let me continue
[28:28] i was reading over
[28:31] in the book of romander
[28:34] is that what we're reading the fourth
[28:36] chapter where paul writes the divine
[28:39] commentary of the life of whom
[28:43] now we know that abraham many times got
[28:48] kind of frustrated like we do
[28:55] so when you meet abraham don't think he
[28:58] was a superman
[29:02] [Music]
[29:04] everybody
[29:05] but
[29:06] when his commentary was written
[29:09] there was not any of the frustration
[29:13] mentioned
[29:14] you see never mention them at all
[29:18] [Applause]
[29:22] what i'm trying to make you understand
[29:24] is if sometimes you get weak in faith
[29:28] it's okay
[29:30] [Music]
[29:33] if sometimes you get discouraged
[29:36] that's normal
[29:48] [Laughter]
[29:52] abraham scattered not
[29:54] at the promise of god through water
[29:57] by was strong giving water
[30:00] so brother branham is using that
[30:02] scripture
[30:03] and he says if you look at this
[30:05] scripture you won't understand something
[30:07] this portion of the scripture was hiding
[30:11] the weaknesses of abraham
[30:16] so when abraham woke up one day and said
[30:22] waiting for the time i will have that
[30:23] promise
[30:25] paul took that and put it there
[30:28] say what else did abraham say
[30:30] what does did abraham say maybe they
[30:33] make fun of him and he say
[30:35] lord
[30:37] i still believe you but remember me
[30:39] abraham took paul took that
[30:42] say what else
[30:43] so when paul presents you you think oh
[30:46] stronger abraham every day in the
[30:48] morning he was like i still believe god
[30:51] i still believe your brother brother i'm
[30:53] saying relax
[30:55] okay
[30:56] those stuff were
[30:58] [Music]
[31:01] everybody clear
[31:02] see that is the way i hope
[31:06] mine will be rolled up there
[31:08] is not my water
[31:11] and everything but just what i tried to
[31:14] water
[31:16] the water
[31:17] intention of my water when god judges
[31:20] you he look in your heart
[31:26] you can get weak in the body but as long
[31:29] as your heart is keep saying father i am
[31:33] weak but i still believe
[31:35] god will take that one and wipe
[31:38] everything away
[31:42] [Applause]
[31:43] hallelujah so when you get discouraged
[31:47] that's normal but keep your heart right
[31:52] you say he hurt
[31:54] father he hurt
[31:56] but i still believe that you hear me
[32:00] when you do that
[32:02] god take a hurt and erase it
[32:05] [Applause]
[32:09] and when you ask god what did brother
[32:12] said say he said bother said say i still
[32:14] believe you
[32:17] oh i heard him say he hurt no he said i
[32:20] still believe you
[32:23] [Applause]
[32:26] [Laughter]
[32:28] hallelujah
[32:30] but just what i tried to do the what
[32:33] intention of my heart to do for god's
[32:36] water
[32:37] that's why james said elias was a man
[32:40] subject to water
[32:43] he was just a normal man
[32:45] brother branham said what it means he
[32:47] has his up and down
[32:49] where did they put it
[32:51] we always look at elijah boom may fire
[32:53] fall
[32:57] hallelujah and he prayed earnestly that
[33:00] he might not reign and he ran not on the
[33:03] earth by the space of three years and
[33:05] six months he was a human just like you
[33:08] amen but amazing grace look at things in
[33:11] a different realm amen
[33:13] please be the name of the lord let's go
[33:15] back again where we were
[33:17] verse 20. he staggered not at the
[33:20] promise of god through unbelief
[33:23] that was water
[33:26] the disposition of the heart
[33:29] anybody clear
[33:30] sometimes he woke up in the morning he
[33:32] hurt
[33:33] but that's not what god is looking at
[33:35] amen
[33:36] giving glory to him
[33:39] so we found here that with his
[33:41] confession he calls
[33:44] things
[33:45] to existence
[33:47] everybody here
[33:49] that were not there
[33:50] and then he was giving glory
[33:53] to god
[33:55] for something that is not even there
[33:59] hey buddy
[34:02] amen verse 21 and being fully persuaded
[34:06] brother john paul was singing this
[34:07] morning
[34:08] being fully persuaded
[34:11] that what he god
[34:13] had promised
[34:15] he was able also to do water
[34:19] you ready now
[34:20] watch verse 22. and
[34:23] therefore
[34:25] in other words
[34:26] this is why
[34:28] in other words
[34:30] for this reason
[34:32] for this kind of behavior
[34:35] for everything that i have just
[34:37] explained you
[34:39] because of what he did that i just give
[34:42] you more detail
[34:44] this is the reason why
[34:47] and therefore he was water
[34:50] to him for water
[34:54] you see now
[34:55] in genesis 15
[34:57] they just say faith he believed god and
[35:00] he was imputed for him for righteousness
[35:03] we stuck
[35:04] but in roman paul is saying before paul
[35:08] said he was imputed to him paul
[35:10] described to us
[35:12] the behavior of abraham
[35:14] when god gave him the promise he was
[35:17] calling the things he was confessing god
[35:19] this is what he did he didn't look at
[35:21] the circumstances because of all of that
[35:25] this is why
[35:27] he was imputed him for righteousness in
[35:31] other words paul is telling you abraham
[35:34] didn't just believe like that
[35:38] the reason why god bring the seal and
[35:40] put it on him it was not just faith but
[35:44] he was faith with action
[35:48] [Music]
[35:51] that was action where he is confession
[35:56] we okay now
[35:57] so today when they say it was imputed
[35:59] unto him now you understand what it
[36:01] means everybody clear
[36:03] verse
[36:04] 23 now he was now written for his sake
[36:08] alone
[36:09] now that was example
[36:12] we wrote it in a bible but i'm just
[36:14] trying to tell you don't stop at abraham
[36:17] because now you understand he was a man
[36:19] just like you
[36:20] okay this didn't stop at him amen
[36:23] [Music]
[36:24] that he was imputed to him verse 24 but
[36:28] for who
[36:30] as also to whom it shall be water
[36:34] so that behavior of god was not only
[36:37] toward
[36:38] abraham but if you do the same thing
[36:42] abraham did
[36:45] you have the same right as abraham royal
[36:48] seed
[36:50] for god to look at you as a righteous
[36:54] anybody here
[36:55] if we do what
[36:58] believe on him that deed water
[37:01] remember what kind of god did abraham
[37:03] believe
[37:05] paul is saying if you also believe in
[37:08] the god of water
[37:10] you see now
[37:11] if we believe on him that raise up jesus
[37:14] our lord from there
[37:16] if abraham believes in the god of
[37:19] resurrection
[37:21] and he behaved this way if you also
[37:24] believe on the god of resurrection
[37:29] then god is obligated
[37:34] i'm saying that clearly god is obligated
[37:42] amen
[37:44] you don't say amen because you don't
[37:46] know who you are
[37:48] we preach to you your origin
[37:52] who here when he get in his parent home
[37:54] he got scared
[37:56] when you get home do you get scared
[37:58] why are you not scared
[38:00] try to go in somebody else's house
[38:03] when you are not invited
[38:05] when you are not expected
[38:07] you have to go this way
[38:10] but if it's in your parents house
[38:12] you enter there you switch the light
[38:15] because you know who you are it is home
[38:19] [Applause]
[38:22] amen
[38:23] so the scripture is teaching you here
[38:26] to begin to behave like in your parent
[38:29] home
[38:30] so when you enter god that's why paul
[38:32] said we have boldness
[38:37] we're not afraid when we're approaching
[38:39] god we're approaching god with boldness
[38:42] with confidence
[38:43] i am not talking to somebody who want to
[38:45] kill me
[38:46] i am talking to somebody who will never
[38:49] kill me
[38:50] [Music]
[38:52] if he killed me he killed himself
[38:54] [Music]
[39:00] let's go to james chapter two
[39:03] don't worry we'll continue to loosen
[39:05] those feathers and remove them and pack
[39:07] them up
[39:08] up up and burn them up
[39:16] how can jonah get mad at god
[39:19] that was the old testament
[39:22] god save somebody and jonah get mad
[39:25] am i reading a different bible and god
[39:28] has asked him he said are you sure you
[39:31] are rightfully to be mad jonah say yes
[39:40] he said this plant was waste here he was
[39:43] giving me i have rightful how can you
[39:45] talk to god like that
[39:46] [Music]
[39:47] do you know what the scripture called
[39:49] abraham
[39:50] he was a what
[39:54] a friend of god

[40:10] say hey come on man
[40:13] because he's your friend
[40:16] right
[40:17] and abraham was talking to god like a
[40:19] friend
[40:20] when god comes he says sit down there
[40:21] abraham let's go say how was your day
[40:23] today that was fun

[41:11] humanity is fighting me
[41:15] oh holy god that's the angel i am not an
[41:19] angel
[41:21] [Applause]
[41:25] brother branham say a son of god
[41:28] have more right than angel
[41:34] those angels never sin
[41:37] they don't understand when i'm sick
[41:40] when i sing redemption amazing grace
[41:42] they don't know what i'm talking about
[41:45] the only one who understands amazing
[41:47] grace is my father because he came down
[41:51] and he become the high priest that can
[41:54] be touched by the feeling of my
[41:56] infirmity
[41:59] when i say headache jesus understand
[42:01] headache
[42:03] gabriel said father what is head that
[42:05] jesus said i know i was there
[42:07] i got one one day when i was preaching
[42:09] in galilee the sun was too hot it hit me
[42:12] i understand what they're talking about
[42:15] [Applause]
[42:16] [Laughter]
[42:18] genesis 17.
[42:21] you understand these things you won't
[42:22] have blood pressure
[42:25] if you understand these things you won't
[42:27] have high blood pressure
[42:32] [Music]
[42:36] if you understand god
[42:38] just obey what god does
[42:41] even though the desire is still there
[42:44] you say because you say i'm taking these
[42:47] shoes i'm putting that off
[42:49] that's all
[42:51] let that desire god will handle it
[42:55] [Music]
[42:58] did you put that desire there
[43:00] you were born with it how are you going
[43:02] to remove it
[43:04] oh you're going to say desire desire
[43:05] come up come on come on come on ah now
[43:08] it's coming up it's here now it's here
[43:12] you see how you try to create force a
[43:14] christian life
[43:17] james chapter two you're the one taking
[43:19] my time
[43:20] seventeen
[43:26] even so faith
[43:29] if he has not water
[43:31] now it's a third element
[43:34] in genesis 15 fifth
[43:36] in roman
[43:39] confession now james
[43:41] say
[43:42] works
[43:47] jesus said faith of abraham
[43:49] roman not only faith there was faith
[43:52] coupled with confession
[43:55] now james say not only faith and
[43:58] confession there is something else
[44:03] amen even so faith if he has not worked
[44:07] it is
[44:08] being water
[44:11] so you cannot have faith and faith is
[44:12] lingering
[44:15] amen
[44:16] yeah a man may say you have faith and i
[44:19] have work
[44:21] both of those extremities a problem
[44:23] amen
[44:25] show me your faith without your work
[44:28] and i will show you my faith by ma
[44:31] you believe that there is one god you do
[44:34] well the devil also believe and tremble
[44:38] so by faith what is the difference
[44:40] between you and the devil
[44:44] because if the devil does what faith say
[44:48] they will be converted
[44:53] [Laughter]
[44:56] verse 20 but will you know
[44:59] oh venman
[45:01] that faith without without work is dead
[45:05] was not who
[45:08] uh i thought paul you already finished
[45:10] with abraham james why do you want to
[45:12] talk about abraham paul already said it
[45:17] was not abraham our father justified by
[45:21] what
[45:22] i thought he was justified by faith
[45:26] i thought he was justified because he
[45:28] was doing confession giving glory to god
[45:31] and calling things to existence now
[45:33] james say he was justified by which
[45:35] which one is now
[45:36] [Music]
[45:42] you see how it works
[45:43] faith
[45:44] will trigger this one
[45:46] and this one will trigger this one
[45:49] it's like a cascade
[45:53] anybody
[45:54] was not abraham our father justified by
[45:57] water
[45:58] by work somebody's sleeping
[46:01] by works or if not i need to give
[46:03] somebody a microphone i can't preach in
[46:05] the quiet oddity everybody here but i'm
[46:08] saying he makes and eventually sick
[46:11] when he offered isaac his son upon the
[46:14] water
[46:15] see
[46:16] you
[46:17] see you have faith
[46:19] wrought in other words working
[46:23] with his water
[46:25] and by words was faith-made water
[46:29] so faith is made perfect
[46:32] or is made complete
[46:35] by water
[46:38] so if you just have faith
[46:41] it is just at the beginning
[46:43] that faith needs to jump stages
[46:46] and for that faith to be finished
[46:50] you must bring works
[46:52] if works is not there your faith is not
[46:55] complete yet
[46:57] amen
[46:58] amen
[47:01] hallelujah
[47:03] hallelujah
[47:04] hallelujah and the scripture was
[47:07] fulfilled which said abraham water
[47:10] believed god and he was water
[47:14] i thought paul already explained that
[47:19] abraham believed god and he was imputed
[47:22] to him for righteousness and he was
[47:25] called the water
[47:29] now james said it was works that justify
[47:33] him that made him complete and after
[47:35] that
[47:36] he was imputed unto him for
[47:39] in here faith righteousness paul said it
[47:42] was confession also righteousness james
[47:44] say
[47:45] confession faith then works then you
[47:48] complete in other words james close
[47:52] the circle of faith
[47:55] the beginning of faith the author and
[47:57] the finisher offer your faith
[47:59] then it's it's confession then when he
[48:02] gets to work james say you finish
[48:09] anybody clear
[48:11] verse 24 you see then
[48:14] amen you see then
[48:17] how that by works a man is water
[48:21] and not by faith only
[48:25] so james is telling you you cannot just
[48:28] have faith
[48:31] if you just have faith you cannot be
[48:33] justified
[48:34] [Music]
[48:35] that's what we thought before james is
[48:38] telling you your faith must be or must
[48:40] go all the way to works
[48:43] then you are justified
[48:45] and paul say not only works you must
[48:48] also confess to be justified
[48:51] so to be really justified we must have
[48:54] faith confession and works
[49:01] anybody here
[49:03] likewise also was it was not rahab they
[49:06] are not justified by water
[49:09] if you got to the book of hebrew herab
[49:11] was justified by what
[49:13] by faith hebrew 11.
[49:18] you see now
[49:20] by faith
[49:21] she said we heard and everybody scared
[49:24] but james said
[49:25] she didn't stop there
[49:27] she took a risk
[49:29] when the spies came she brought this
[49:31] prize
[49:33] he was showing that truly she really
[49:36] believed
[49:40] everybody clear
[49:42] when
[49:43] she had received the messenger and had
[49:46] sent them out another way for us the
[49:50] body without the spirit is dead
[49:54] so faith
[49:55] without work is welcome
[49:58] so if you have a faith that you never
[50:01] put in action it is air
[50:04] [Music]
[50:07] how many dead faith do we have

[53:12] last week about men and the three realms
[53:16] that man leaves brother branham said
[53:18] that god when he made man in the
[53:20] beginning
[53:21] he made him superior to anything on
[53:25] earth
[53:28] he gave him the jurisdiction of
[53:30] everything on earth
[53:33] to control water
[53:36] everything
[53:37] he controlled the animal life
[53:40] he controlled the fire life remember
[53:42] last sunday
[53:44] the fish is of the sea he controls the
[53:47] wind he controls the plant life he
[53:50] control
[53:51] everything that's what man is up
[53:54] everybody clear so far
[53:56] brother branham continued he said man
[53:58] was made as a secondary god
[54:02] on earth
[54:04] he was given the power
[54:06] to control
[54:08] all things all element of the earth that
[54:12] was who adam
[54:15] adam was given these great powers
[54:18] but then the power that was given to
[54:21] mank to make himself is where he fell
[54:25] and adam could speak to the wind
[54:28] and he would stop
[54:30] he could speak to the trees
[54:32] and they would obey him
[54:34] he could speak to the wildlife the
[54:36] tongue
[54:37] and he will obey him he could speak to
[54:40] the waters tongue
[54:42] ever what it is
[54:44] everything obeyed adam because that is
[54:48] the position god made man
[54:51] now
[54:52] that is the beginning of man
[54:54] that is what god give him power over
[54:58] everything on the earth
[55:01] though they fall he lost through the
[55:04] fall he lost the power
[55:06] then he became unconscious
[55:09] of the fact after losing his
[55:12] relationship and water
[55:15] but to abraham abraham became the friend
[55:19] of god
[55:21] anybody here
[55:23] fellowship with the father
[55:25] then he lost that and all of his great
[55:28] channels become clogged up and he could
[55:32] not get through not what adam was in god
[55:36] christ has redeemed us back to water
[55:41] now a redeemer to redeem many things
[55:44] is to bring it back to its origin again
[55:49] how many believe you redeem man
[55:55] why are we not using our tongue amen
[55:58] amen
[56:01] we found out last sunday that men
[56:04] operate under three elements
[56:07] brother branham said the first element
[56:09] was humanistic and we explained it to
[56:11] you that it was a carnal
[56:13] the second one it was the divine
[56:15] revelation of faith
[56:17] the third one was vision or what we call
[56:21] that save the lord which is perfect
[56:23] everybody so far
[56:25] the corner we explained to you that it
[56:27] was working with the brain and the top
[56:30] of it was the eye
[56:32] then the divine faith or divine
[56:34] revelation of faith was coming from the
[56:37] heart that's why i ask you if everybody
[56:39] is on board with the sermon and the
[56:41] vision take the brain and the heart and
[56:44] couple them together everybody cares so
[56:46] far
[56:47] so under carnal humanistic it works with
[56:51] the visible element the other one is a
[56:53] divine which is the supernatural the
[56:56] third one take both of them the
[56:58] supernatural and
[57:00] the visual and put them back together
[57:02] everybody clear
[57:04] now in here we have the five senses of
[57:07] the body
[57:09] under divine revelation we have the five
[57:12] senses of
[57:13] the supernatural
[57:15] ever here
[57:16] but now we were dealing with the vision
[57:19] brother branham said but all these
[57:21] impressions
[57:22] we must not take them and say that save
[57:26] the lord
[57:28] buckle up pretty good because we're
[57:29] going somewhere
[57:31] we must not do that i'm talking about
[57:33] the vision
[57:34] we must have a direct voice
[57:38] an answer from god
[57:40] before we can say it is god
[57:44] not an impression
[57:47] not a sensation
[57:50] no matter how much it is proceeding
[57:54] now you got to be very careful here
[57:56] because the realm of faith
[57:59] uses those things
[58:02] brother branham says
[58:04] when you get to the corner mind first
[58:07] the corner mind can give you an
[58:09] impression
[58:11] hey mark here
[58:12] you look at something you say huh you
[58:14] look good
[58:15] sometimes it doesn't look good
[58:17] the corner man can give you a sensation
[58:20] anybody care and the colonel man can
[58:23] also give you a post of something ever
[58:26] here when you move from the corner mind
[58:29] to the divine revelation
[58:32] faith also does that
[58:35] they cannot have knowledge
[58:39] here
[58:40] faith also have knowledge
[58:42] but it's just a different kind of
[58:44] knowledge
[58:45] this is a knowledge intellectual this is
[58:48] a knowledge by revelation or godly
[58:52] knowledge
[58:53] about here faith also will give you an
[58:56] impression
[58:59] faith also can give you a sensation
[59:03] and faith also can give you a procession
[59:07] the difference is this one operate by
[59:10] the brain but this one operates by the
[59:13] heart
[59:14] everybody here so far
[59:16] and brother problem says that not an
[59:19] impression not a sensation
[59:22] no matter how much it is proceeding
[59:25] you must say i believe it could be this
[59:28] way when you say it could be that is
[59:30] hope
[59:32] everybody here there is a hesitation
[59:35] here
[59:36] anybody care
[59:37] but faith there is no hesitation
[59:40] it is solid
[59:41] and it is positive about here but when
[59:44] you get to vision
[59:46] this is what brother branham is talking
[59:48] about now you go to a higher rate right
[59:50] back here brother problem said but when
[59:52] you speak that safe the lord about here
[59:56] it is not you
[1:00:01] watch on the platform have you ever seen
[1:00:04] it fail
[1:00:05] that self the lord is water
[1:00:08] that's their highest reign
[1:00:11] never has failed and as long as it is
[1:00:14] that save the lord he can fail
[1:00:18] that is the realm of the vision
[1:00:20] brother branham continues here he said
[1:00:23] you be sure that god says that now and
[1:00:26] not an impression
[1:00:28] as i said the other night there is too
[1:00:30] many gimmicks in pentecost
[1:00:32] pentecostal people that is the reason
[1:00:35] the sincerity and the confidence has
[1:00:37] been lost
[1:00:38] because they were presuming on things
[1:00:41] they take up something and say that self
[1:00:43] the lord when he was not that saved the
[1:00:45] lord then he failed then they get
[1:00:46] discouraged
[1:00:48] everybody
[1:00:49] amen because of carnal impersonation
[1:00:53] if we were sure that was god we set
[1:00:57] still
[1:00:58] everybody here so when we say that self
[1:01:01] the lord you be sure that it's god
[1:01:04] not your honor
[1:01:07] or
[1:01:08] impression or possession everybody
[1:01:13] know that it is god and then in this
[1:01:16] case he spoke back to her and told her
[1:01:19] perfectly normal been that way ever
[1:01:22] since that's why jesus said i do nothing
[1:01:24] except the father shows me first
[1:01:27] everybody clear so far
[1:01:29] blessed be the name of the lord when we
[1:01:31] say that you need to move from a corner
[1:01:35] into the faithframe and into the vision
[1:01:38] it is not something that is
[1:01:40] extraordinary
[1:01:43] god can never ask you to do something
[1:01:47] when he have not seen in you the ability
[1:01:50] to do it
[1:01:53] anybody here so far when god asks you to
[1:01:56] do something
[1:01:58] you are able automatically to do it
[1:02:01] [Music]
[1:02:02] paul cell present i called myself to
[1:02:06] have i can't not myself to have
[1:02:09] apprehended but this one thing i do
[1:02:12] forgetting those things which are water
[1:02:15] and reaching forth unto those things
[1:02:17] which are water
[1:02:19] even paul in his christian experience
[1:02:22] always was longing to clamp higher with
[1:02:25] god
[1:02:26] ever here
[1:02:28] i pressed toward the mark for the price
[1:02:30] of a high calling of god in christ jesus
[1:02:34] brother explained this he said i like
[1:02:37] paul saying those things
[1:02:39] paul never was a person that liked to
[1:02:42] stay too long in one place
[1:02:45] anybody here so if paul was living under
[1:02:49] carnal impersonation paul moved on to
[1:02:51] faith but he didn't want to stay in
[1:02:53] faith paul wanted to move always higher
[1:02:56] hey but here brother branham say i like
[1:02:59] paul paul never was a person that liked
[1:03:01] to stay too long in one place
[1:03:04] he liked to move on
[1:03:06] deeper
[1:03:07] one time in a scripture he said
[1:03:09] for i forgetting those things which are
[1:03:11] in past i pressed toward the mark of a
[1:03:14] high calling see he kept pressing on he
[1:03:17] said now forgetting the principles of
[1:03:21] the doctrine of christ who he was what
[1:03:24] he was let us go into water
[1:03:27] about here
[1:03:29] blessed be the name of the lord is
[1:03:31] coming
[1:03:32] now in acts 22 verse 3 and 6
[1:03:35] paul says this
[1:03:37] he says i am verily a man which i am a
[1:03:39] jew
[1:03:40] born in texas
[1:03:42] a city of silesia yet brought up in this
[1:03:46] city at the feet of gamaliel
[1:03:49] and taught according to the perfect
[1:03:51] manner of the law of the fathers and was
[1:03:55] zealous toward god as we all are this
[1:03:59] day
[1:04:00] paul says that i was a religious man
[1:04:04] i knew the law back and forth
[1:04:06] i was taught right
[1:04:08] but despite everything that i did i was
[1:04:11] living under a humanistic
[1:04:15] in other words paul was a religious
[1:04:19] humanistic man
[1:04:22] we have a bunch of them in the message
[1:04:26] everybody created so far
[1:04:28] he said i persecuted this way
[1:04:31] unto death meaning he was not under
[1:04:33] revelation that's why he was against the
[1:04:35] god
[1:04:36] binding and delivering into prison both
[1:04:39] men and women as also the high priests
[1:04:42] do bear me witness and all the instead
[1:04:45] of the elders from whom i also receive
[1:04:48] letters unto the brethren and went to
[1:04:51] damascus to bring them which were there
[1:04:54] banned unto jerusalem for to be what
[1:04:56] punished
[1:04:58] a man living under humanistic
[1:05:01] and religion can do things like that
[1:05:04] attacking the vindicated word of the
[1:05:06] hour thinking he's doing a service to
[1:05:08] god
[1:05:10] that his son that that man is under
[1:05:12] humanistic
[1:05:13] and he came to pass that as a magma
[1:05:16] journey and was come nigh on to damascus
[1:05:19] about noon
[1:05:20] suddenly they're shown from heaven a
[1:05:23] great light round about me
[1:05:26] what else does experience do to paul
[1:05:29] the bible says paul continued he said my
[1:05:32] manner of life from my youth which was
[1:05:34] at first among my own nation at
[1:05:36] jerusalem know all the jews everybody
[1:05:39] knew me
[1:05:40] which knew me from the beginning if they
[1:05:43] would testify the people that knew me
[1:05:45] that after the most straightest
[1:05:48] set off our religion i live a pharisee
[1:05:52] when you look at paul perfect in the law
[1:05:55] nothing to condemn him yet humanistic
[1:06:00] anybody clear
[1:06:02] one two o king agrippa i was not
[1:06:05] disobedient unto the heavenly water
[1:06:09] now poor one god pick him up
[1:06:12] god pick him up from this realm all the
[1:06:15] way here
[1:06:19] everybody
[1:06:21] what did the vision of god do to the
[1:06:23] life of power
[1:06:26] ever here
[1:06:28] paul said in philippians 3 but what
[1:06:31] things were given to me look at the
[1:06:33] power of vision
[1:06:35] those are counted lost for who
[1:06:40] these ramps when you get into these
[1:06:43] ramps
[1:06:44] you don't have to do anything
[1:06:47] watch god move you from this place
[1:06:50] and god bless you here all you have to
[1:06:53] do is relax
[1:06:56] god will take care of everything outside
[1:07:02] blessed be the name of the lord he said
[1:07:04] yeah doubtless and i counted all things
[1:07:07] but lost for the excellency of the
[1:07:10] knowledge of christ jesus my lord for
[1:07:14] whom i have suffered the loss of water
[1:07:17] one vision
[1:07:19] cut everything out
[1:07:21] ever here and do cut damn water
[1:07:25] that i may win who one vision
[1:07:29] in second corinthians 12 1 paul said it
[1:07:33] is not expedient for me that leads to
[1:07:36] glory i will come to water
[1:07:39] and to water
[1:07:41] paul is now telling you this is where
[1:07:42] i'm living now
[1:07:44] i'm living in visions and in revelation
[1:07:48] that is the realm i'm operating now
[1:07:51] hey but here i'm no longer in the
[1:07:53] humanistic realm amen
[1:07:55] let's go to first corinthians chapter 2
[1:08:00] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:08:03] if you dare you can say amen
[1:08:06] fifth corinthians chapter 2
[1:08:08] paul says this
[1:08:12] in verse
[1:08:13] 1
[1:08:14] paul says
[1:08:16] and i present
[1:08:18] when i came to you
[1:08:20] came not with excellency of
[1:08:22] water all of what
[1:08:25] i'm not coming anymore to preach on the
[1:08:28] humanistic level
[1:08:32] make sense
[1:08:33] amen
[1:08:35] declaring to you the testimony of who
[1:08:39] no more humanistic
[1:08:41] ever here
[1:08:44] job two verse four and my speech
[1:08:47] and my preaching was not with entrancing
[1:08:51] words
[1:08:52] of man water
[1:08:54] i'm no more operating in humanistic
[1:08:57] level about here
[1:08:59] but in the demonstration
[1:09:02] of the spirit and of water i am now
[1:09:05] living in a different room
[1:09:08] why paul verse 5 that's your faith
[1:09:12] everybody
[1:09:14] should not stand in the wisdom of men
[1:09:19] i was there i persecuted the church
[1:09:22] i thought i was doing right but i was
[1:09:25] against the message of the hour now god
[1:09:28] who is reaching mercy rescue me
[1:09:31] and i'm coming to you
[1:09:34] not bringing again that foolishness
[1:09:38] because that's what makes me do things
[1:09:40] against god
[1:09:41] about here
[1:09:43] but that your faith should not stand in
[1:09:46] the wisdom of god but in the power of
[1:09:48] god
[1:09:49] however we speak wisdom among them that
[1:09:52] are perfect in christ
[1:09:55] yet not the wisdom of this world
[1:09:58] humanistic
[1:10:00] nor of the presence of this world
[1:10:02] humanistic there come to what nothing
[1:10:07] but we speak the wisdom of god in a
[1:10:10] mystery
[1:10:12] even the hidden wisdom which god
[1:10:15] ordained before the word to our glory
[1:10:18] which none of the princes of this world
[1:10:21] knew
[1:10:23] forehead they know it
[1:10:25] they would not have done what else
[1:10:29] the reason they crucified the lord they
[1:10:31] were living under humanistic
[1:10:34] and paul living under humanistic was
[1:10:37] crucifying jesus christ that's why when
[1:10:40] jesus met him he said paul pal why do
[1:10:43] you persecute me
[1:10:48] everybody cares so far
[1:10:50] but as it is written i has not seen
[1:10:54] nor he heard neither have entered into
[1:10:57] the heart of man the things which god
[1:11:00] has prepared for them that love him
[1:11:02] how do we get them first hand but god
[1:11:05] has done water
[1:11:08] revealed them to us by his water paul is
[1:11:12] going to the faithful room again
[1:11:15] revelation ever here
[1:11:17] by the spirit for the spirit searches
[1:11:21] all things
[1:11:22] yeah the deep things of god for what man
[1:11:25] knows the things of a man save the
[1:11:28] spirit of man which is in him
[1:11:30] even so the things of god knows no man
[1:11:34] humanistic but the spirit of god
[1:11:37] revelation
[1:11:39] now we have received not the spirit of
[1:11:42] the world but the spirit which is of god
[1:11:44] that we might know
[1:11:46] the things that are freely given to us
[1:11:50] of god
[1:11:52] which thinks also we speak not in the
[1:11:55] words he insisted which meant wisdom
[1:11:59] teaches
[1:12:00] but which the holy ghost teaches
[1:12:03] comparing spiritual things with
[1:12:06] spiritual everybody here verse 14 but
[1:12:09] the natural men receive not the things
[1:12:12] of the spirit for their water
[1:12:16] neither can he know them because they
[1:12:18] are spiritually discerned
[1:12:21] not the natural man by the spiritual man
[1:12:24] everybody clear so far
[1:12:26] blessed be the name of the lord paul
[1:12:28] says here in ephesians
[1:12:30] as he is not cease not to give thanks
[1:12:33] for you
[1:12:34] making mention of you in my prayer
[1:12:37] paul is praying for the center
[1:12:39] paul why what are you telling god in
[1:12:41] your prayer
[1:12:43] ever here
[1:12:45] that the god of our lord jesus christ
[1:12:48] the father of glory may give you the
[1:12:51] spirit of water
[1:12:53] and of water
[1:12:54] in the knowledge of water
[1:12:57] paul his prayer to the christian
[1:13:00] was god
[1:13:01] keep them right here
[1:13:05] everybody
[1:13:06] keep them ready
[1:13:07] and the revelation
[1:13:09] why
[1:13:10] because the eye of your understanding
[1:13:14] being enlightened remember that's i
[1:13:16] that he may know what is the hope
[1:13:20] of his calling and what is the riches of
[1:13:23] the glory of his inheritance in the
[1:13:25] water and what is the exceeding
[1:13:28] greatness of his power to others who
[1:13:31] believe according to the working of his
[1:13:34] mighty water
[1:13:35] paul says that i'm praying that
[1:13:38] christians stay here
[1:13:40] and make their growing revelation to
[1:13:43] understand the power that god
[1:13:46] have put into their own benefit
[1:13:52] everybody here so far
[1:13:53] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:13:56] we took those three elements we put them
[1:13:58] together humanistic this way divine
[1:14:01] revelation this way the vision in the
[1:14:03] middle and we talked about the dream
[1:14:05] last time amen
[1:14:07] and we found out that dream was the
[1:14:09] vision of the night
[1:14:10] now concluding with the dream brother
[1:14:12] branham says this he said dream are not
[1:14:16] an assurance
[1:14:18] every dream is not from god
[1:14:21] now there is many people that has
[1:14:23] dreamed and they have all kind of dream
[1:14:26] and you go to bed at night and eat a big
[1:14:28] supper and go to bed and you might dream
[1:14:31] anything
[1:14:34] so when you dream things make sure you
[1:14:35] didn't eat too much
[1:14:38] hey but here you might have a fever and
[1:14:41] you might have all kind of nightmare and
[1:14:43] so forth that is not god but yet god
[1:14:47] does deal with people through
[1:14:50] ever clear
[1:14:52] now the next
[1:14:54] was how god dealt with the people
[1:14:56] through dream in the days of joseph did
[1:14:59] you notice a dream is secondary
[1:15:01] it's a secondary way of god working some
[1:15:05] people can have dream don't mean nothing
[1:15:08] you can eat too much and have nightmares
[1:15:12] i love the prophet the bible says in
[1:15:15] ecclesiastical
[1:15:17] for dream cometh through the multitude
[1:15:20] of business
[1:15:22] when you so busy
[1:15:24] your mind is so preoccupied
[1:15:27] if what you have in your mind stuck too
[1:15:29] much there when you enter into rest in
[1:15:32] your heart you can pull that with you
[1:15:34] and have a dream
[1:15:38] that's why it's hard
[1:15:39] when you already love the man by sight
[1:15:41] to decide because you can take that
[1:15:44] image and jump into it and you think
[1:15:46] it's a revelation
[1:15:48] to me again
[1:15:49] did you hear me again you already love
[1:15:51] the man
[1:15:52] and you begin to pull that inna and when
[1:15:55] you wake up you say i dream he was
[1:15:57] bringing me a flower you already fell in
[1:15:59] love
[1:16:04] is it okay
[1:16:08] and after 10 years that was not my
[1:16:10] husband
[1:16:11] but i thought you told me you have a
[1:16:12] vision that he was your husband
[1:16:17] it was infatuation
[1:16:20] amen and through the test of time is
[1:16:23] going to bust
[1:16:25] everybody
[1:16:26] a dream is secondary
[1:16:28] something off to one side because people
[1:16:31] can have dreams that are not right that
[1:16:34] is not right but there was no prophet in
[1:16:37] the land in that day
[1:16:41] there was no prophet therefore god had
[1:16:44] to use what he has to use with and
[1:16:48] teaches us that god
[1:16:50] can use every faculty and everything
[1:16:54] that we do if it is
[1:16:57] consecrated to him
[1:16:59] but he first must be consecrated
[1:17:03] let your meditation remember king
[1:17:05] nebuchadnezzar which will reflect your
[1:17:08] water
[1:17:10] so before you go to bed watch what
[1:17:12] you're meditating on
[1:17:15] everybody here you can carry that to
[1:17:17] your dream everybody clear because it's
[1:17:19] your subconscious if you watch a dream
[1:17:22] you shall see that it's something that
[1:17:24] you have been thinking of
[1:17:26] or something like that usually you see
[1:17:29] and let your mind be on god
[1:17:31] see then so he reflects something from
[1:17:34] who
[1:17:35] and whatever you are let it reflect him
[1:17:38] but pranam is saying if you go to bed
[1:17:41] and you're thinking about god you're
[1:17:42] thinking about god you're pulling god
[1:17:44] closer to you that's what king
[1:17:45] nebuchadnezzar do and when you enter
[1:17:48] into your subconscious then god comes
[1:17:51] and speaks to your subconscious
[1:17:53] but if you are thinking about something
[1:17:55] else you can carry that also in your
[1:17:57] subconscious
[1:17:58] but it's not coming from god
[1:18:00] ever clear so now you need to know how
[1:18:03] to discern
[1:18:04] what a newborn see he never had any
[1:18:08] interpretation the dream was not in
[1:18:11] symbol it was right straight don't fear
[1:18:13] to take mary your mouth that wife and
[1:18:16] that which is conceived in here is of
[1:18:17] the holy ghost there was no prophet to
[1:18:20] give the interpretation so he had to
[1:18:22] come
[1:18:23] right straight like that
[1:18:25] god from god to joseph and god take a
[1:18:29] god taking that second early way what
[1:18:31] does it teach us right here before we we
[1:18:34] hit our text
[1:18:36] here is what he teaches us that god can
[1:18:38] use every faculty
[1:18:40] of our being if it's surrendered to him
[1:18:44] he can use your mind
[1:18:46] our dreams our subconscious our first
[1:18:50] conscience our
[1:18:52] our
[1:18:54] our
[1:18:55] everything that we have can be used of
[1:18:58] god if it is committed to
[1:19:01] everything that you are committed to god
[1:19:05] he shall use every outlet every part of
[1:19:09] you he shall use it
[1:19:12] because god created men to be a god
[1:19:17] no matter what it is he shall use it if
[1:19:20] it's sanctified to his purpose and
[1:19:23] calling
[1:19:26] everybody here so far
[1:19:28] blessed be the name of the lord now in
[1:19:30] damn days they had no prophet they had
[1:19:32] not had a prophet 400 years and so god
[1:19:35] dealt with him in a dream a dream is a
[1:19:39] secondary way the right way is always to
[1:19:43] do
[1:19:46] you remember
[1:19:47] always
[1:19:48] if there is no dream if there is no
[1:19:50] vision if there is no revelation you
[1:19:53] have a right as a believer to go back to
[1:19:56] the world and stay ready
[1:20:00] so if there is no dream you can stand
[1:20:02] with the world
[1:20:03] no vision you can stay with the world so
[1:20:06] don't be intimidating
[1:20:08] if somebody have a gift of vision and
[1:20:11] you don't have it
[1:20:14] they can operate through their gift and
[1:20:16] sometimes they can even go to hell
[1:20:19] but as long as you stay with the world
[1:20:23] even though you don't have vision if
[1:20:25] there is no impression if there is
[1:20:28] nothing the word of god will stand you
[1:20:31] forever
[1:20:32] [Applause]
[1:20:38] judah was gifted he went to hell
[1:20:42] amen
[1:20:44] have we not prophesied in your name have
[1:20:46] we not cast our devil in him and jesus
[1:20:48] said i never even knew you
[1:20:53] everybody here
[1:20:55] the word is the ground level
[1:20:58] you can see vision read your bible
[1:21:00] listen to the word
[1:21:02] because that gives you the grand level
[1:21:05] but here
[1:21:07] now god has has a way of proving whether
[1:21:10] his word is right or not everybody so
[1:21:13] far so this side gives you hope
[1:21:16] and the other side gives you faith about
[1:21:19] here
[1:21:20] now let's dig deeper into this
[1:21:24] blessed be the name of the lord i hope
[1:21:26] this computer will work here
[1:21:29] please be the name of the lord because
[1:21:31] this is where the course stuff is
[1:21:33] where the good good good stuff are
[1:21:35] amen
[1:21:36] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:21:39] hallelujah
[1:21:43] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:21:45] the devil knows what he's fighting
[1:21:47] but too late
[1:21:49] it's already working
[1:21:51] amen
[1:21:53] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:22:00] give me a minute and we go through this
[1:22:08] amen
[1:22:10] let's see go ahead and escape my brother
[1:22:14] hit escape
[1:22:16] i'm not gonna give up
[1:22:25] amen
[1:22:26] let's see what he comes up with
[1:22:29] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:22:31] so if there is no vision there is no
[1:22:34] prophecy there is nothing you have a
[1:22:36] ground to go through you go by the word
[1:22:38] of god you doom the devil that's it
[1:22:41] the bible says in matthew here
[1:22:44] that one day they lift you up buckle up
[1:22:47] pretty good
[1:22:48] take no water
[1:22:51] how you shall water
[1:22:54] who delivered you
[1:22:57] who did it yourself
[1:22:59] who did it
[1:23:01] if you look there
[1:23:03] there is two words
[1:23:05] here
[1:23:06] take no water
[1:23:09] god doesn't want you think
[1:23:12] anybody care
[1:23:15] take no thought or how you shall do what
[1:23:18] there is a thinking and speaking
[1:23:22] about here
[1:23:24] when you go through a situation
[1:23:28] do you hear me
[1:23:30] do you hear me
[1:23:31] that is pressing on you
[1:23:35] do you hear me
[1:23:36] that situation
[1:23:38] is pushing you to do two things
[1:23:43] do you follow me
[1:23:44] that situation
[1:23:47] it is the devil who wants you to use
[1:23:50] your brain
[1:23:54] everybody here
[1:23:55] and it is the devil who wants you to use
[1:23:59] your brain
[1:24:00] and to speak by your brain
[1:24:05] everybody
[1:24:07] when the devil oppresses you it means
[1:24:10] you are no longer living under
[1:24:12] humanistic
[1:24:14] because the first level is humanistic
[1:24:18] the second level is faith
[1:24:21] the third level is vision when you are
[1:24:24] here the devil sees you everywhere you
[1:24:26] going
[1:24:28] you are under his weather
[1:24:30] do you follow me so when you move from
[1:24:33] this place and you are living here
[1:24:36] are you there
[1:24:37] the devil bring trial in your life
[1:24:41] do you follow me the reason he's putting
[1:24:44] pressure
[1:24:45] he wants you to live faith and to come
[1:24:48] back here
[1:24:51] do you follow me
[1:24:53] we want you to stop thinking
[1:24:56] and speaking like a carnal mind
[1:25:00] because when you speak like a corner man
[1:25:04] you begin to drop down life and death is
[1:25:07] in the power of your tongue you begin to
[1:25:09] lower down
[1:25:11] what do you think about the economy oh
[1:25:14] the economy is bad
[1:25:15] it's so bad i don't know what's going on
[1:25:18] i don't know what's going on
[1:25:22] i don't know what's going to come in
[1:25:23] this world i'm afraid about my job yeah
[1:25:26] we too we are slow we're going too slow
[1:25:29] you begin to adopt a language
[1:25:32] amen
[1:25:33] you begin to adopt a language and you
[1:25:35] don't see that you're going down
[1:25:37] you're going down
[1:25:38] why before that person come you are
[1:25:41] probably thinking about the lord will
[1:25:43] provide the lord to jehovah the lord
[1:25:46] will do this the lord will do this and
[1:25:48] suddenly somebody comes and bring you
[1:25:51] into something to pull you down
[1:25:57] stay tight everybody
[1:25:59] so when you go to trial
[1:26:02] to pressure number one no the devil
[1:26:05] won't fight you if you don't have
[1:26:06] anything good
[1:26:08] [Music]
[1:26:10] do you hear me
[1:26:11] if there is nothing good in you the
[1:26:13] devil won't fight you
[1:26:15] hallelujah
[1:26:19] if there is nothing on your tree
[1:26:22] there is no fruit nobody will come there
[1:26:26] if they are attacking you there is
[1:26:27] something there meaning you are off his
[1:26:30] radar
[1:26:31] you are somewhere there so he is
[1:26:33] bringing pressure
[1:26:35] to make you think in a humanistic way
[1:26:41] and the holy ghost say
[1:26:43] that when you are under the pressure
[1:26:46] don't take thought
[1:26:49] how what you shall speak
[1:26:52] for it shall be what
[1:26:54] in the same hour what ye shall what
[1:26:58] for it is not ye that speaketh
[1:27:00] [Music]
[1:27:03] remember the vision is not you
[1:27:06] do you understand
[1:27:07] in other words god is saying when you
[1:27:10] are living here
[1:27:11] if something come to trouble your
[1:27:14] hormone
[1:27:15] don't begin to
[1:27:16] think about here this realm
[1:27:20] have revelation available for you
[1:27:23] [Music]
[1:27:24] do you hear me
[1:27:26] do you hear me
[1:27:27] he said for it is not you that speak
[1:27:30] but the spirit of your father which
[1:27:32] speaketh in water
[1:27:34] but when the lead when they shall lead
[1:27:37] you and deliver you up take no thought
[1:27:40] beforehand
[1:27:42] what you shall speak neither do you
[1:27:49] how can i do that
[1:27:51] i'm a human being
[1:27:53] something happened i have to think over
[1:27:55] it but whatsoever shall be given to you
[1:27:58] in that hour that you speak for it is
[1:28:01] not ye that speak but uh
[1:28:05] they bring you on to the synagogue again
[1:28:07] to magistrate and power take no thought
[1:28:10] how and what thing you shall answer for
[1:28:12] what you shall say for the holy ghost
[1:28:15] shall do what
[1:28:17] in death
[1:28:19] watch you out to water
[1:28:21] meaning you are in a different level
[1:28:24] amen
[1:28:26] that's why brother branham says this
[1:28:28] amen
[1:28:29] what kind of people would it be this
[1:28:32] morning
[1:28:33] if this spoken word tabernacle
[1:28:36] this morning was so filled with the
[1:28:39] presence of god why when you didn't even
[1:28:44] use your own
[1:28:46] did it even use your own
[1:28:49] did it even you have the ultimate of
[1:28:52] your own but just be led by the spirit
[1:28:58] wine and they that are sons of god are
[1:29:01] led by the spirit of god then when the
[1:29:04] human element
[1:29:07] goes out the spirit of god feel that
[1:29:10] vacancy where you empty yourself
[1:29:14] [Music]
[1:29:14] [Applause]
[1:29:17] when problem comes to your home
[1:29:20] learn to empty yourself
[1:29:25] amen
[1:29:27] hallelujah
[1:29:28] there will be a wonder church
[1:29:31] in its power of resurrection of the lord
[1:29:33] jesus christ we walk in his step
[1:29:36] in his power in his thought in his being
[1:29:40] in his water
[1:29:42] then your thought will become
[1:29:45] and what will become
[1:29:48] [Music]
[1:29:50] are you there are you there
[1:29:53] here
[1:29:54] the important things one of the
[1:29:56] important things that we must master
[1:29:59] now remember this and especially you
[1:30:01] young preachers
[1:30:03] and lay members alike there is one thing
[1:30:07] that we got to master if we expect to
[1:30:11] fulfill god's desire in our
[1:30:14] how many want to see god desire fulfill
[1:30:16] in their lives
[1:30:18] if you expect to see god's desire
[1:30:21] fulfill in your life
[1:30:22] we have to master the thought of water
[1:30:27] the pressure the devil brings on you he
[1:30:31] wants you to use your human ability
[1:30:36] hallelujah
[1:30:38] if we ever get to a spot where we think
[1:30:42] that we can do it with our own
[1:30:44] intelligence and our own abilities we
[1:30:47] got to master that in such a way that we
[1:30:50] can get rid of the thing
[1:30:52] and lay it aside so that god can use us
[1:30:57] and make it complete
[1:31:00] we cannot use one ability
[1:31:06] we've got to make a complete surrender
[1:31:10] to come to god you got to surrender to
[1:31:13] him buffer
[1:31:17] everything that you are has to be
[1:31:19] surrendered to god
[1:31:22] in order that he can work with his will
[1:31:24] in you and me
[1:31:27] so when the trials are coming when the
[1:31:30] preacher comes
[1:31:32] remember one thing don't use your mind
[1:31:34] [Music]
[1:31:36] it is the devil pulling you down
[1:31:39] everybody clear so far
[1:31:41] blessed be the name of the lord brother
[1:31:44] branham say i'm going to say something
[1:31:45] to you now that i have not said along
[1:31:49] they think that we have looked forward
[1:31:52] for so long
[1:31:53] for at last many years
[1:31:56] four or five years or maybe longer there
[1:32:00] has now been

[1:38:43] but i say unto you that every other word
[1:38:46] that men speak they shall give an
[1:38:48] account therefore in the day of judgment
[1:38:51] for by that
[1:38:53] that shall be what
[1:38:58] i thought you justified by faith
[1:39:01] i thought you justified about works
[1:39:05] now you are justified by what
[1:39:07] abraham
[1:39:12] by that word you shall be justified and
[1:39:16] by what that word that shall be what
[1:39:20] life
[1:39:21] and death in the power of water
[1:39:24] the bible says i know that work that
[1:39:27] that are neither cold nor heart i would
[1:39:30] that that were cold or hard
[1:39:32] so then because they are lukewarm
[1:39:36] and neither cold
[1:39:38] no heart i was purely out of my
[1:39:43] what does he mean
[1:39:45] he wants you red hat
[1:39:49] or
[1:39:51] one or the other
[1:39:53] don't be lukewarm

[1:39:58] have not got
[1:39:59] either be on fire for god
[1:40:02] or go back in the water

[1:40:28] level i will spew you out of my mouth
[1:40:32] here in other words it make him sick
[1:40:36] to see the church in that condition
[1:40:40] about here
[1:40:41] to be spewed out of the mouth of god
[1:40:44] blessed be the name of the lord it means
[1:40:46] what brother branham the church is no
[1:40:49] longer the water

[1:49:24] what i'm preaching you is not something
[1:49:26] i'm trying to push you
[1:49:28] are you there or something that you
[1:49:31] merited something but it's what god did
[1:49:34] for you
[1:49:36] not that you were so good
[1:49:38] that you went to a church one night that
[1:49:41] some poor brother led you to the altar

[1:54:11] now paul is saying this that by the
[1:54:13] righteousness which is of faith that was
[1:54:15] the law
[1:54:16] he's speaking on these words say it not
[1:54:19] in the heart who shall go to heaven that
[1:54:22] is to bring christ down from above
[1:54:24] christ already came and who shall
[1:54:26] descend to the deep that is to bring
[1:54:29] christ again from the dead in other
[1:54:31] words christ already came paid the press
[1:54:34] went over there finished the work
[1:54:36] resurrected again it is finished
[1:54:38] so don't worry about that part
[1:54:41] everybody clear what should i worry
[1:54:43] about
[1:54:44] but what say is it
[1:54:46] the word is nighty
[1:54:48] even in there
[1:54:50] and in the
[1:54:52] heart and mouth and tongue that is the
[1:54:54] word of faith
[1:54:56] which we preach that is that sir
[1:55:01] the lord jesus christ and shall believe
[1:55:03] with them
[1:55:05] now paul begin to put this thing
[1:55:07] together now he said this believing
[1:55:09] god's in the heart
[1:55:11] and this goes in the mouth

[1:55:24] heart that god has rehearsed him from
[1:55:27] the dead the god of resurrection that
[1:55:29] shall be water
[1:55:30] for with them

[2:01:19] work on that
[2:01:24] like joshua did like mary magdalene
[2:01:27] although just that moment when something
[2:01:30] is revealed to you
[2:01:32] do you hear me
[2:01:34] grab it
[2:01:36] hold to it
[2:01:38] that's prayer of a moment
[2:01:40] sometimes this great procession of water
[2:01:44] comes right in the time of water
[2:01:48] because when he squeeze you
[2:01:50] then god also
[2:01:54] everybody here
[2:01:56] it usually crashes
[2:01:58] that drive us into
[2:02:02] you think he's being in trial
[2:02:05] he's just giving me opportunity to
[2:02:07] receive the revelation
[2:02:09] hey
[2:02:10] uh he was a crisis that drove job into
[2:02:13] him why he was at the end of his life
[2:02:17] he was a crisis that he presses himself
[2:02:20] there is where the inspiration struck
[2:02:23] him
[2:02:26] blessed be the name of the lord i know
[2:02:28] it's the truth it's god's word it's the
[2:02:30] truth something begins to pulsate in
[2:02:32] your bosom that it is the truth
[2:02:36] then make what
[2:02:38] you are coming around after that
[2:02:40] just as certain as i'm standing in this
[2:02:43] pulpit tonight don't look at what you
[2:02:45] see abraham how bad i'm crippled how
[2:02:49] sick i am what the doctor said don't
[2:02:52] look at that look at the ascent
[2:02:55] what god
[2:02:57] before you feel any different
[2:03:00] before the pain leaves
[2:03:02] before the hand moves
[2:03:05] before the eyes can see one side
[2:03:08] ye make water
[2:03:10] for it's going to come
[2:03:12] as long as that possession begin to rise
[2:03:16] in your bosom in your heart where god
[2:03:19] set under control
[2:03:21] in other words when you begin to feel
[2:03:23] something coming up
[2:03:26] grab it
[2:03:28] [Applause]
[2:03:30] grab it hallelujah
[2:03:33] be fearless in your testimony
[2:03:38] if it's revealed to you you are
[2:03:42] you don't care with the whole world
[2:03:45] what they say you are
[2:03:47] when it's revealed to you that this is
[2:03:50] the truth coming from god then you are
[2:03:54] [Applause]
[2:03:58] hallelujah
[2:03:59] i think that the holy spirit can lead
[2:04:02] man
[2:04:02] and tell him things and make him act
[2:04:05] different and make him believe things
[2:04:07] and receive things that the world never
[2:04:09] could believe could happen
[2:04:11] i'm a witness
[2:04:13] oh i can't ah oh can you feel that
[2:04:16] possession of the spirit begin to rise
[2:04:18] in your heart
[2:04:19] saying jesus christ is in our midst
[2:04:22] wherever two or three are gathering my
[2:04:24] name i've been there missed pulsation
[2:04:28] what is a possession it is something
[2:04:31] moving
[2:04:32] like ah
[2:04:35] it's pumping water
[2:04:37] to you
[2:04:39] it's pumping energy to your
[2:04:41] mind then let the things that your eyes
[2:04:44] see black out
[2:04:46] that you see not the things of the world
[2:04:49] you are believing what god have
[2:04:52] so when you feel something coming up
[2:04:55] like it's pumping something is repeating
[2:04:58] in your heart
[2:05:00] it is a signal
[2:05:02] it is a signal
[2:05:04] hallelujah if you believe that with all
[2:05:07] your heart
[2:05:09] accept it
[2:05:10] and do what
[2:05:12] now you can believe it as much as you
[2:05:15] wanted to
[2:05:16] if you didn't
[2:05:19] works
[2:05:20] you shall sit right there
[2:05:22] like a sinner would lay at the altar
[2:05:25] [Music]
[2:05:27] he shall never get through
[2:05:30] until he
[2:05:33] and
[2:05:34] confess it and
[2:05:37] and show what
[2:05:40] [Music]
[2:05:42] hallelujah
[2:05:43] just as the body is dead without the
[2:05:46] spirit so is faith without work what
[2:05:49] i no matter how much you believe
[2:05:52] your faith is not complete
[2:05:54] until you begin to
[2:05:56] and you begin to do water
[2:06:00] what are you using your tongue for
[2:06:02] what are you using your tongue for
[2:06:04] you know what people what you know what
[2:06:06] makes people happy what makes them stand
[2:06:09] right in the midst of difficulty and say
[2:06:11] it's so
[2:06:12] never move they understand
[2:06:15] god said so
[2:06:17] you got to have faith but you got to
[2:06:20] know how to use that faith to make
[2:06:22] yourself
[2:06:24] to get happiness out of your life
[2:06:28] it's not just believing but you must not
[2:06:30] stop a believing
[2:06:32] you must move on to confess to
[2:06:34] confession and you must act like it's
[2:06:37] already been done
[2:06:38] then you can gain the benefit of it
[2:06:41] hallelujah you say you don't have faith

[2:15:27] [Music]
[2:15:30] i saw your son in a nightclub who no
[2:15:33] that is not my son my son is saved
[2:15:36] [Applause]
[2:15:41] hallelujah
[2:15:42] my son has already been saved the one
[2:15:45] you see there that's not my son
[2:15:47] [Applause]
[2:15:49] that is not my son mine is safe
[2:15:52] my family will go to heaven
[2:15:56] [Applause]
[2:16:02] my husband is coming
[2:16:05] where is he at that's not my problem
[2:16:08] because the inspiration struck me that
[2:16:11] i'm a woman
[2:16:12] if i'm a woman i was pulled from
[2:16:14] somebody
[2:16:16] ah if i was pushing from somebody that
[2:16:18] person must be there
[2:16:20] so i need my person from whom you took
[2:16:23] me out of it
[2:16:30] and start praising god
[2:16:32] like you have it
[2:16:34] abraham believe god
[2:16:37] confess
[2:16:38] calling those things
[2:16:40] like they were never existed and he put
[2:16:42] it to action
[2:16:44] god bless you
[2:16:46] god bless you
[2:16:47] [Applause]
[2:16:57] thank you
[2:17:00] hallelujah
[2:17:02] the tongue and your confession
[2:17:05] the tongue
[2:17:06] can get you out of here
[2:17:09] all the way here
[2:17:10] your prayer can get you out of here
[2:17:13] all the way here
[2:17:15] use your tongue adequately
[2:17:18] when something rises up
[2:17:21] brother brother say everything
[2:17:24] that god leads your soul to believe it
[2:17:28] belongs to you
[2:17:29] [Music]
[2:17:31] sometimes we try to make people believe
[2:17:34] what belongs to you
[2:17:36] i don't need you to believe what
[2:17:38] happened what i need
[2:17:39] because my choice might be different
[2:17:41] than yours when god revealed to me my
[2:17:44] choice
[2:17:45] when something comes in your heart
[2:17:48] and speak to you
[2:17:50] and you understand that this is not me
[2:17:53] because i was not thinking this
[2:17:56] where does this thought come from
[2:17:58] grab it
[2:18:01] and begin to
[2:18:03] say it
[2:18:04] if you're struggling say it loud
[2:18:08] say it loud until the devil hears it
[2:18:12] until your own self begin to believe it
[2:18:15] you say it so much
[2:18:19] when you get to say praise the lord for
[2:18:21] giving me a house praise the lord for
[2:18:24] giving me a house
[2:18:26] praise the lord for giving me a house
[2:18:28] father i thank you for this beautiful
[2:18:30] house that you've given me because you
[2:18:32] spoke in the old testament that you will
[2:18:34] give me a house that i have not built
[2:18:38] when you begin to do that
[2:18:40] god say oh
[2:18:42] gabriel
[2:18:44] i told you
[2:18:46] these children are coming up
[2:18:48] these children are coming up
[2:18:50] and do you know what he let the devil
[2:18:52] turn loose
[2:18:53] to see if you really mean it
[2:18:55] amen
[2:18:56] and the more you do it the more you do
[2:18:59] it the more you do it you will see after
[2:19:01] a while
[2:19:02] it looks like you forgot about it
[2:19:05] and suddenly something opened up
[2:19:08] it is not difficult
[2:19:10] we cannot keep teaching these things
[2:19:12] and you don't use it
[2:19:16] we cannot keep saying
[2:19:17] i'm the faith of the word are they
[2:19:19] surprised spoken with the spoken word
[2:19:20] they spoken with let's stop in that
[2:19:24] attitude of hearing hearing hearing
[2:19:25] hearing
[2:19:30] abraham
[2:19:31] was justified not just believing
[2:19:35] he believed
[2:19:36] he spoke
[2:19:38] by speaking he was doing two things
[2:19:41] he was first calling what he needed to
[2:19:44] existence
[2:19:45] and he was also giving god the glory
[2:19:49] so if i need a job
[2:19:51] first i need to call that job
[2:19:54] and say father thank you for giving me
[2:19:56] that job
[2:19:57] i have a job
[2:19:59] and then once you accepted you say thank
[2:20:02] you jesus for giving me that job
[2:20:05] and you begin to get prepared
[2:20:07] and take your alarm and put even the
[2:20:09] time you need to start waking up in the
[2:20:11] morning
[2:20:13] [Music]
[2:20:16] this is what abraham was doing
[2:20:20] not i'm praying
[2:20:22] for god to give me an opening on
[2:20:24] wednesday no you need to speak
[2:20:30] you go back to your supervisor you say
[2:20:32] you know what i'm a christian
[2:20:34] i just want to let you know is there a
[2:20:36] possibility i'm doing this this this
[2:20:38] this i wanted to do this i wanted this i
[2:20:40] wanted this i wanted this the lord told
[2:20:42] me to ask and it shall be given to you
[2:20:45] that's why i came to ask if there is a
[2:20:47] possibility if i can get this schedule
[2:20:49] this kind of schedule i'm asking you as
[2:20:52] a supervisor i'm coming and i'm asking
[2:20:54] you the scripture told me to ask
[2:21:02] sometime the troop officer would say no
[2:21:04] and then you get discouraged i asked it
[2:21:07] didn't work
[2:21:09] if i spoke to the supervisor when i'm
[2:21:11] going home
[2:21:12] praise the lord for healing
[2:21:16] even if the supervisor is not moving
[2:21:18] that's not my problem
[2:21:19] but if you keep praising the lord
[2:21:22] believing that it's already done
[2:21:25] you will hear that same man calling you
[2:21:27] he said come here what were you saying
[2:21:30] the other day
[2:21:31] yes i talked to my
[2:21:34] this is your schedule
[2:21:38] [Music]
[2:21:39] i say it didn't work
[2:21:42] what are you losing
[2:21:44] [Music]
[2:21:46] what are you losing
[2:21:48] for trying god
[2:21:50] what do you lose
[2:21:52] nothing
[2:21:53] you can sit quiet two hours
[2:21:56] or you can sit quiet two hours bothering
[2:21:58] the devil
[2:22:02] what do you lose
[2:22:04] have you tried
[2:22:07] let's leave the humanistic level
[2:22:10] it's a lot of headache you work too much
[2:22:14] you have to work overtime all the time
[2:22:16] you are tired
[2:22:19] you have to put yourself at work
[2:22:21] your wife have to work
[2:22:23] and your wife have to work too much you
[2:22:25] got to work too much
[2:22:27] and you got comfortable with that
[2:22:31] why is other people working less and
[2:22:33] they make money
[2:22:36] and me suffering
[2:22:38] whether i have a great god
[2:22:40] father can you bless me with something
[2:22:44] that i could be able to be free from
[2:22:47] this situation i want to see my wife
[2:22:49] enjoying her home
[2:22:50] yes i want to see her home with the
[2:22:53] children
[2:22:55] i'm opening your mind
[2:22:59] so you don't get stuck to the system
[2:23:01] until our young people they want to get
[2:23:03] married is 50 50 50 50.
[2:23:06] that's not it
[2:23:09] if she hears it that's no problem but
[2:23:11] i'm talking about me
[2:23:13] and my lord
[2:23:15] solomon say that i see princess walking
[2:23:18] and i see slave
[2:23:20] on
[2:23:21] horses
[2:23:22] how can a slave be on horse
[2:23:24] and the prince is walking
[2:23:26] it's written in your scripture if you
[2:23:28] need that scripture tell me
[2:23:30] because princes do not understand and
[2:23:32] the slave took over
[2:23:35] and they say oh that stupid child
[2:23:39] let me ride that car
[2:23:41] and the child is suffering
[2:23:42] [Music]
[2:23:44] amen let's pray heavenly father
[2:23:49] lord we are approaching you again humbly
[2:23:51] this morning
[2:23:52] father thanking you for everything
[2:23:55] lord we took time and went over
[2:23:59] because we want this thought to be
[2:24:01] driven all the way to the end
[2:24:04] father
[2:24:05] may you remember your children for the
[2:24:07] sacrifice they have done
[2:24:10] to stay up to this time
[2:24:12] just to receive your instructions
[2:24:15] lord
[2:24:17] it's a routine
[2:24:19] it's a spirit
[2:24:21] a religious spirit
[2:24:23] that i infiltrated the message a long
[2:24:25] time
[2:24:26] and made people
[2:24:28] living so low
[2:24:30] under privileges
[2:24:32] young people without even any ambition
[2:24:36] not even looking for
[2:24:38] further misunderstanding the scripture
[2:24:41] and the coming of the lord
[2:24:43] not even understanding how to move in
[2:24:47] condoning with situation
[2:24:49] condoning with this present world
[2:24:52] acting just like anybody
[2:24:54] until we reach a point where
[2:24:56] beside what we're hearing
[2:24:58] there is no difference between us and
[2:25:00] the man in the next door
[2:25:02] but father you spoke in your scripture
[2:25:04] in the old testament that there was a
[2:25:07] difference between those that serve you
[2:25:09] and those that were not serving you
[2:25:11] there was a difference between israel
[2:25:14] and egypt lord
[2:25:16] even in the very ground of egypt in
[2:25:19] goshen
[2:25:20] father the egyptians
[2:25:22] were in their land but israel was not in
[2:25:25] his homeland but even in that strange
[2:25:28] land
[2:25:29] father you made a difference
[2:25:32] between your people
[2:25:33] and those that were not your children
[2:25:36] father you could be light in goshen and
[2:25:39] he was darkness in egypt lord
[2:25:41] father even there even the egyptian
[2:25:43] could testify the multiplication of the
[2:25:46] hebrew even lord father the wise women
[2:25:49] could say that even when they were
[2:25:51] giving birth there was a difference
[2:25:54] between an egyptian woman giving birth
[2:25:56] and father an israelite woman giving
[2:25:59] birth
[2:25:59] [Music]
[2:26:02] father you made a difference
[2:26:04] even in the delivery room
[2:26:07] lord if in that old atonement of a
[2:26:10] bloody lamb
[2:26:11] that was lord nature you could do such a
[2:26:13] thing how much more in this atonement
[2:26:16] lord of a precious lamb
[2:26:19] of the lord
[2:26:20] father may you take the people
[2:26:23] and may you shake every humanistic
[2:26:26] father dependency away from them
[2:26:29] father may we all learn to move away
[2:26:32] from this ground father and remain in
[2:26:34] the reins of the revelation
[2:26:36] in the reigns of the vision lord so that
[2:26:39] the people can learn not only to be
[2:26:41] hearers of the word
[2:26:43] but father to be doers of the word lord
[2:26:46] lord father use what have been given
