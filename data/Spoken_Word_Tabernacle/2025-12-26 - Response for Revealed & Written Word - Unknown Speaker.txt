========================================

more than 5,000 people online. So we want to welcome them also to spoken word tabernacle. We see new subscriber. God richly bless you and welcome to the channel where we believe the message of brother Brandham 100%. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In this church the message and the Bible are &gt;&gt; if you have a problem you see me I will spend time with you and drill that in. Amen. You know, I I I made a mention here because folks are taking my sermon and chopping them, &gt;&gt; slicing them up &gt;&gt; and putting new sermon and everything. &gt;&gt; And one time I even mention here, I say you cannot take the written word &gt;&gt; and I'm going to repeat it again. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I don't have time for bickering. &gt;&gt; I seen that in the message all over. &gt;&gt; Amen. The fighting between minister and the back and forth the pingpong. I don't have time for monkey game. Amen. My ministry I'm delivering what the Lord gave me and I keep moving forward. &gt;&gt; That era of fasting whatever I don't have time. So this is the only time I'm going to say something about it and I won't even mind it anymore. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You don't take the written word, &gt;&gt; the Bible, &gt;&gt; to challenge the reveal or the word made flesh. &gt;&gt; The person took the quote. Brother Brandham say that you need to check me by the word. We don't need to check brother Brandham by the way. &gt;&gt; The message is already vindicated. &gt;&gt; I don't know if we together. &gt;&gt; Brother Brham took his Bible &gt;&gt; and put it on the pulpit &gt;&gt; in front of preachers &gt;&gt; and told them to come and show one thing &gt;&gt; that he preached that is contrary to that. &gt;&gt; NOBODY SHOWED UP. SO DON'T COME today &gt;&gt; and TRY TO BEGIN TO TELL ME you're going to verify what brother Brandham say. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you can show me the error of brother Brham, who are you? &gt;&gt; So the entire bride need to listen to you &gt;&gt; because you WILL TELL US WHICH PART IS right and which part is wrong. We don't need you. &gt;&gt; THE MESSAGE IS VINDICATED. 100%. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Bible say in the beginning was what? &gt;&gt; The word. &gt;&gt; And the word was with God. And the word was who? &gt;&gt; God. &gt;&gt; And the word was made what? &gt;&gt; Flesh. &gt;&gt; And do you know what the Pharisee did? &gt;&gt; They went to challenge the word made flesh &gt;&gt; by THE LAW. WHEN JESUS HIMSELF WALKS THE WORD &gt;&gt; INSTEAD OF GOING TO JESUS CHRIST AND LET JESUS CHRIST WALK THEM THROUGH THE SCRIPTURE &gt;&gt; LIKE HE DID TO THE TWO DISCIPLE ON THE ROAD TO EMMAS. HE STARTED FROM MOSES ALL THE WAY DOWN &gt;&gt; TO SHOW THEM WHO HE WAS. &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? HUMBLE YOURSELF BEFORE BROTHER BRHAM. WHEN BROTHER BRANDHAM SAYS SOMETHING, SAY AMEN. &gt;&gt; EVEN IF YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND, SAY AMEN. &gt;&gt; THEN THE ANOINTING THAT WAS ON THE PROPHET WILL COME UPON YOU AND WALK YOU THROUGH THE BIBLE AND YOU WILL SAY, "PRAISE THE LORD." NOW I SEE WHAT BROTHER BRAN WAS TALKING ABOUT. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? WATCH WHO YOU watching on YouTube. &gt;&gt; I'm going to show you the error of brother Brham. What is error? &gt;&gt; Where were you at? &gt;&gt; Brother Brham. The angel of the Lord. Maybe you don't understand who brother is. The angel of the Lord touched somebody &gt;&gt; and let and and left an imprint of a hand. &gt;&gt; IT WAS THE HAND OF THE ANGEL OF THE LORD. They took the hand of brother Brana AND THEY PUT THERE AND HE FIT THE HAND. I hope WE TOGETHER. THAT'S WHY THE SWORD OF THE KING FIT HIS HAND. &gt;&gt; NOT YOUR HAND, NOT MY HAND. ONLY THE PROPHET HAND. &gt;&gt; DO YOU SEE MY FACE OVER THERE? &gt;&gt; NO. &gt;&gt; DO YOU SEE MY FACE OVER THERE? DO YOU SEE ANY PREACHER FACE OVER THERE? ONLY ONE VINDICATED BY THE PILLAR OF FIRE. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; IN THIS CHURCH, WE SAY AMEN. &gt;&gt; WE SHOUT. &gt;&gt; WE JUMP IN THE SPIRIT. WE ARE FREE IN THE SPIRIT. &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; If this message is hard for you to swallow, please, we don't beg people for the message. The predestinated seed, we don't beg them. &gt;&gt; They will stick with THE MESSAGE. IF THE MESSAGE IS TOO HARD FOR YOU, WALK OUT SLOWLY. &gt;&gt; LEAVE US ALONE. BUT AS FOR ME AND THIS CHURCH, THE MESSAGE IS RIGHT. &gt;&gt; THE MESSAGE IS 100% LINE UP WITH THE BIBLE. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? Which Bible did you read? &gt;&gt; When you were reading the Bible, we were all Catholic over there. &gt;&gt; The Catholic got the Bible. The Protestant got the Bible. The Methodist got the Look at the mess where we are &gt;&gt; and God send you a vindicated prophet. &gt;&gt; And the Bible SAY IF A PROPHET says something &gt;&gt; and what he says happen, what do you have to do to that prophet? &gt;&gt; Listen to him. &gt;&gt; LISTEN TO HIM. HOW MANY PROPHECY DID YOU SEE? A WOMAN IN PURPLE. AN AMERICAN POPE. IT'S NOT THAT ENOUGH FOR YOU. HOW MANY PROPHECY DO YOU WANT? &gt;&gt; An American president. Catholic. It happened. Woman in purple. It happened. An American pop. How many prophecy do you still want? &gt;&gt; You still waiting for Los Angeles. H. You will go down with Los Angeles. We are going up. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. So, this is my last time I'm responding to you. You who put that thing online. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I know what I'm talking about. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Never take the Bible and say, "Brother Brandham, show me, show." No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. If we understand the Bible, my mother look at me, she say, "How where did you learn this Bible like this?" I say, "Bye, brother. Amen. The one who makes me love my Bible is brother Brandham. &gt;&gt; The more I'm I'm listening to brother Brandham, I begin to love my Bible so much and the BIBLE BECAME A NEW BOOK &gt;&gt; BECAUSE OF THE MESSAGE. &gt;&gt; How do you challenge brother? &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Were you in that cloud? Did they pick you UP &gt;&gt; when you were born? Did somebody come to visit you? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you have a name written in seven hills? is your name with ham. &gt;&gt; And the man that CAN TURN THE BACK TO THE CONGREGATION. &gt;&gt; Manifesting who? &gt;&gt; Say it. &gt;&gt; Elohim. &gt;&gt; Elohim. &gt;&gt; Not in the flesh of Jesus Christ. Glory, glory, glory, glory. &gt;&gt; That's why he say he's borrowing my body &gt;&gt; because God could not borrow the body of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; The body of Jesus Christ belongs to God. But when he take another body, he's borrowing. &gt;&gt; Play with all the Pentecostal, but don't touch Malachi. Do you know the Jews when you speak about Moses they take &gt;&gt; stone BROTHER &gt;&gt; BECAUSE THEY KNEW WHO MOSES WAS. When the bride will understand, brother Brandham, you won't let anybody COME TO YOUR HOUSE and begin to blabber garbage. I WILL OPEN THE DOOR. I SAY LEAVE RIGHT NOW &gt;&gt; BECAUSE YOU DON'T TOUCH THE PROPHET. YOU DON'T TOUCH A VINDICATED PROPHET FROM ENOCH ALL THE WAY HERE. THERE IS NO ONE LIKE HIM. &gt;&gt; THE ONLY ONE ABOVE HIM IS THE LORD JESUS CHRIST. THE MAN WHO made me love Jesus above everything is brother. &gt;&gt; BECAUSE OF BROTHER BRANDHAM, I LOVE JESUS AND UNDERSTAND THE DEITY OF JESUS CHRIST. &gt;&gt; AND WHEN I'M WORSHIPING, I'M WORSHIPING IN SPIRIT AND IN TRUTH BECAUSE THE MESSAGE IS THE TRUTH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. If you need views online and you want to use my name to pick up views, you wasting your time. &gt;&gt; I don't have time for views. &gt;&gt; Keep that unclean money to yourself. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't use my name. Unsubscribe. Go somewhere else &gt;&gt; here. Brother Brandham say the Bible say brother Brandham say the Bible say that's how we preach here. The Bible say by the brand I'm saying. The Bible say by the brother say that's how we preach it &gt;&gt; because both of them are one. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; I believe we all up to date with the sermon. &gt;&gt; And we reading our Bible every day twice. Amen.
