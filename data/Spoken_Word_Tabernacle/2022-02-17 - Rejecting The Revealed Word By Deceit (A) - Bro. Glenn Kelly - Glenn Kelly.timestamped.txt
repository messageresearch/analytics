[32:29] tired
[32:31] amen
[32:32] okay blessed be the name of the lord
[32:35] hallelujah good to see everybody tonight
[32:38] and we appreciate everyone that prays on
[32:41] you know there is a lot going on but guy
[32:43] god's grace we hear amen
[32:46] brother greg mentioned something and i
[32:48] was uh we were chatting on my way coming
[32:51] here and the court came back to me
[32:53] brother branham says this in the angel
[32:56] of the covenant
[32:58] if you need that coat you see me
[33:01] he said now
[33:03] that was the pillar of fire made
[33:06] manifest here on earth
[33:08] following the will of god
[33:11] now tonight after 1900 years
[33:14] we have that same pillar of fire in our
[33:18] midst
[33:21] you bought a picture of it a while ago i
[33:24] say it with reverence
[33:26] scientifically proven
[33:29] this is the key now brother random say
[33:32] if i would die this very night
[33:37] if i brother branham if i would die this
[33:41] very night
[33:42] now that pillar of fire has nothing to
[33:45] do with me
[33:48] amen
[33:49] so the pillar of fire never left with
[33:51] brother branham
[33:53] amen
[33:54] when moses left that pillar of fire was
[33:56] still there and he turned into a person
[34:00] which was the captain of the host
[34:02] because the characteristic remained the
[34:05] same when joshua met him and when moses
[34:08] met him they did the same thing telling
[34:11] you it's the same god only in more faith
[34:15] amen brother branham said if i would die
[34:18] this very night
[34:19] that pillar of fire has nothing to do
[34:22] with me
[34:23] i'm just a man that pillar of fire is in
[34:26] the church
[34:28] not only with me
[34:31] it is with every one of you
[34:34] it is all of us
[34:37] do you believe it
[34:41] amen
[34:43] there is another one where brother
[34:44] branham said that whatever god does with
[34:47] a messenger of the age it's an example
[34:50] to every believer of that age
[34:53] it's like a wave shift that have been
[34:55] given up
[34:56] and when you see that you know exactly
[34:58] what god is calling for amen so don't
[35:02] leave below your privilege blessed be
[35:04] the name of the lord everybody up to
[35:06] date with the sermon
[35:08] everybody already left the land of moab
[35:14] amen
[35:15] or somebody's still there maybe by
[35:18] marriage
[35:19] not yet
[35:20] we'll shake again the boat pretty good
[35:23] and make sure nobody says in the message
[35:26] because they were born in the message or
[35:29] because they were they got married in
[35:31] the message or the friend was in a
[35:32] message you need the solid anchor
[35:36] amen that is beyond that amen beyond
[35:39] your family relationship that is above
[35:42] your family relationship because your
[35:45] true family
[35:47] is the one that's going to go there
[35:50] amen whoever will not be there you're
[35:52] not going to see them anymore
[35:54] maybe they came from a different world
[35:57] maybe the underneath world like judah
[35:59] and they have to go back
[36:01] amen
[36:02] amen
[36:03] blessed be the name of the lord that
[36:05] just the word
[36:06] and it's a fact amen
[36:08] remember keep everything simple and
[36:11] we'll continue to rock the boat until we
[36:13] make sure
[36:14] you examine yourself and you know that
[36:16] you are in the faith that you are in the
[36:19] holy of holies amen don't get fooled if
[36:23] you don't have it you don't have it be
[36:26] the walk in the water without the holy
[36:28] ghost
[36:30] today if somebody walk in the water we
[36:32] give him the holy ghost
[36:35] right
[36:36] judah preached the gospel without the
[36:38] holy ghost
[36:39] and all the disciples preach the gospel
[36:42] without the holy ghost
[36:45] am i saying something different
[36:47] because the veil was closed
[36:49] and jesus could only bring them to the
[36:52] holy place that's why jesus justified
[36:55] them and jesus sanctified them in john
[36:58] 17 17 where the bible say you are
[37:01] sanctified with my word that's as far as
[37:04] jesus have to stop because he was not
[37:07] glorified yet
[37:09] but when he died and jesus rose again
[37:12] and they took judah out
[37:15] everybody
[37:16] then jesus began to call them children
[37:18] go look at the scripture because now
[37:21] those are the children of god then those
[37:23] can go to the pentecost where they enter
[37:25] the holy of holies then the holy spirit
[37:27] comes and still the same disciple amen
[37:31] so now we don't have to wait because the
[37:33] veil has been rent the hell has been
[37:35] went
[37:36] in the tabernacle and it also has been
[37:38] went up so your prayer can go straight
[37:41] and reach the throne of god amen
[37:44] so remember keep examining yourself
[37:46] don't fool yourself
[37:48] if you don't have it you don't have it
[37:50] amen
[37:51] and if you don't have it you got to get
[37:53] serious with god amen
[37:55] continue to pray with one another
[37:57] brother sean martin sent me
[38:01] a mail for his uh
[38:04] tenth meeting it's a faith uh
[38:07] it's a fifth tabernacle usually it's
[38:09] like a spring meeting something like
[38:11] that and it's gonna be from april the
[38:14] 27th to may 1st so i will give it to the
[38:19] deacon back there if anybody is
[38:21] interested in going there and if you
[38:23] want to go there and support
[38:25] the meeting and everything just talk to
[38:28] one of the deacons we keep everything
[38:29] here amen so remember if you want
[38:32] probably brother robert can remind me we
[38:34] can just as we get closer just give the
[38:36] announcement one more time because he
[38:39] send it to us amen how many knows by the
[38:42] sean martin he preached for us in a
[38:43] hotel he's a wonderful service

[38:48] wonderful service so remember if you

[38:54] reservation and everything talk to the
[38:56] deacon we give you the information and
[38:58] you make sure you support the meeting

[44:20] let's go to genesis 3
[44:25] once you have it say amen

[44:30] genesis 3 and 1 says noun the serpent
[44:33] was more subtle than any beast of the
[44:36] field
[44:37] which the lord god had made and he said
[44:39] unto the woman ye
[44:41] have god said you shall not eat of every
[44:44] tree of the garden
[44:46] and the woman said unto the serpent we
[44:49] may eat of the fruit of the tree
[44:53] may eat of the fruit of the trees of the
[44:55] garden but of the fruit of the tree
[44:58] which is in the midst of the garden god
[45:01] hath said ye shall not eat of it neither
[45:04] shall ye touch it lest she die
[45:07] he said and the serpent said unto the
[45:09] woman ye shall not surely die
[45:12] for
[45:12] god knoweth do it know that in the day
[45:16] he eat thereof then your eyes shall be
[45:19] opened and ye shall be as god's knowing
[45:22] good and evil may the lord add a
[45:24] blessing to the reading of his word you
[45:26] may be seated i know it's wednesday
[45:28] night but we still going to knock the
[45:29] devil
[45:30] out ah they gonna know that's right
[45:33] brother said we're gonna knock him out
[45:34] huh because we got a word in his hour we
[45:37] got a word in this hour
[45:40] to beat the devil anywhere anytime any
[45:43] place on any ground okay so we have to
[45:46] own them we're playing churches over
[45:49] with is that right every promise is ours
[45:52] we're going to get in every soul that's
[45:54] out there we're going to bring them back
[45:56] is that right because the lord is now
[45:59] moving in and out we see times is
[46:02] winding up we see prophecies and things
[46:04] are being fulfilled in this hour here
[46:06] now oh and what a message sunday morning
[46:09] huh my my my my mind that's just the
[46:13] beginning of it hum brother robert do
[46:15] you see the grace how merciful our god
[46:17] is how graceful our god is how he did
[46:21] when bo asked bo as you know what he had
[46:23] both as no he had a special bullet
[46:26] didn't he both
[46:27] know that he could go to his god right
[46:30] that's why it's a message of grace if
[46:32] you don't see grace in this message sit
[46:35] down go to the altar now you can go to
[46:38] your private place and ask god to unfold
[46:41] it for you is that right it's all about
[46:43] the grace of god
[46:45] [Music]
[46:49] whoa
[46:50] motorbike wasn't even supposed to be in
[46:51] there huh brother sam hammond knight
[46:54] wasn't even supposed to be in there huh
[46:55] brother gray
[46:57] hallelujah
[46:59] but what we're looking at here tonight
[47:02] i got a rejecting the revealed word
[47:05] by deceit
[47:10] the revealed word by deceit
[47:13] see so we're going to understand now
[47:16] we're going to extend the mercy and
[47:18] grace that god put in us
[47:20] you know i got the inspiration of from
[47:22] satan's eating i was looking into
[47:25] satan's eating but the one thing that
[47:27] kept pricking my heart you know when
[47:29] brother branham was saying some things
[47:32] and about this age and and about it
[47:34] about the times even from the beginning
[47:37] eve didn't really want to be that like
[47:39] that she didn't wanted satan to see her
[47:42] with with the words is that right
[47:44] he came with trickery is that right he
[47:47] knew he he'll come with everything but
[47:51] one part of the word he'll leave it out
[47:53] is that right
[47:55] so we have to understand in this hour
[47:57] now who you are where you come from and
[48:00] why you are here is that right you
[48:03] already know that you are in the origin
[48:05] of god is that right
[48:07] you was there before the word came out
[48:10] is that right he said you were in the
[48:12] mind of god he said let there be what
[48:15] light is that right now the word that
[48:17] was in the mind of god became light is
[48:20] that right now you are that light you
[48:23] are now the manifested word that god is
[48:26] bringing into this age into this hour
[48:29] hallelujah
[48:31] if i don't if i don't get to all of it
[48:34] that's okay i'm gonna go the way he
[48:36] wants to go
[48:38] so you have to realize
[48:40] that satan
[48:41] he's a deceiver
[48:43] he's a deceiver but he's good he's a
[48:46] good adversary
[48:48] so we're going to find out from the
[48:50] beginning what sorcery how did brother
[48:53] branham say that the whole world is
[48:56] going to be deceived by sorcery is that
[48:59] right the scripture says over in
[49:02] revelation 18 that the whole world is
[49:05] going to respect the sea by what sorcery
[49:08] is that right so satan just doesn't come
[49:11] with sin and make it look bad is that
[49:14] right we know he doesn't come that way
[49:17] we know that in this hour here now and
[49:20] that a drunker they know where they're
[49:22] going if they die that way a drug addict
[49:25] they know where they're going if they
[49:26] die that way a prostitute know where
[49:29] she's going when they can say he too now
[49:32] huh when he or she is going to now if
[49:35] they leave here in that hour they know
[49:38] where they're going is that right
[49:40] but was the ones that think they're
[49:42] serving god
[49:46] we're coming out this simple but deep
[49:50] we're going to show you that's why he
[49:52] said we wrestle not against flesh and
[49:54] blood but form to come with eve with the
[49:57] word is that right he came with even
[50:00] with the word twisting the word he
[50:03] always perverted he's a pervert he's
[50:05] always changing the word up on somebody
[50:08] that's why they're coming in this hour
[50:11] here now it's disturbing the message up
[50:13] is that right you gotta imagine some of
[50:16] you can't imagine what's going out from
[50:18] here it's not just leaving locally it's
[50:21] going internationally so it's moving
[50:24] internationally so we're knocking every
[50:26] demon down that thought it was hidden
[50:28] because the word of god said he's giving
[50:31] us a promise is that right everything
[50:33] that is hidden he's going to root it up
[50:36] is that right he's going to uncover
[50:38] everything that this devil planted and
[50:40] what everything are precious brothers
[50:43] but it wasn't that what father
[50:46] son
[50:47] holy ghost everything that the reaper
[50:50] sold to the organized system is that
[50:52] right we're going to root it up it was
[50:55] acts 2 38 is that right that was a
[50:58] revelation of the word is that right
[51:01] we're going to move let me read some
[51:03] things to you because i'm telling you
[51:05] something you're living and satan's
[51:08] eating but in this satan's eating
[51:10] we're in laodicea but we're not of the
[51:14] world is that right we're on a total
[51:16] different mission that's why the lord
[51:19] has given us revelation of that
[51:21] tabernacle now that tabernacle that is
[51:24] giving us the revelation of now none
[51:27] moses never his generation he saw it one
[51:30] way is that right even though he got it
[51:32] from god but he saw it that way those
[51:35] that are lutheran lutheran saw it in
[51:37] their time is that right all those
[51:40] justifications just but they didn't even
[51:43] have the full revelation of
[51:45] justification that we have is that right
[51:49] they had the portion for that age they
[51:51] could still smoke a pipe he could still
[51:54] drink beer and still they're making it
[51:56] is that right some got stuck on that
[51:58] there saints but we're moving i'm
[52:01] telling you we're moving into something
[52:03] we're going to move rapture right on out
[52:05] of here this rapture can take place any
[52:08] day now
[52:10] everything is in place saints we got to
[52:13] understand they saying these things that
[52:15] we got we don't need
[52:18] god promised it and i thank god for him
[52:21] you're here because he put a seed inside
[52:24] of you to thirst for it
[52:27] [Music]

[52:33] i know good we're warring against his
[52:36] kingdom
[52:37] his religious kingdom we're going to
[52:40] tear down by the word of god
[52:43] because you can now go into the holiness
[52:46] of holy the veil's been ripped

[53:37] the promises of god of this age
[53:41] he says not something that somebody else
[53:44] was in some other day
[53:46] he said them things are all right but
[53:49] we all refer to those things but i
[53:52] thought

[53:58] that would enlighten you
[54:00] to know

[54:10] you're a soldier you're a soldier of the
[54:13] cross we wrestle not against flesh and
[54:15] blood but against principality and
[54:17] powers and wickedness and rulers in high
[54:20] places stop listening to the lies of the
[54:23] devil jesus christ took care of it on
[54:26] calvary when he shed his blood for each
[54:29] and every one of us is that right
[54:31] hallelujah at the cross at the cross
[54:33] where i first saw the light and the
[54:35] burdens of my heart rolled away it was
[54:38] there by faith i received my sight now

[54:48] [Applause]
[55:01] let me tell you now

[55:08] he said to no
[55:10] make you a better soldier in the field
[55:12] that you're fighting in that you're
[55:15] fighting it now to learn the tactics of
[55:17] the enemy so that you can block
[55:20] everything before it gets to you huh
[55:24] we're getting somewhere why did he give
[55:26] you the helmet of salvation is that
[55:29] right first way you're going to come and
[55:31] come into what your mind is that right
[55:34] huh but you don't listen to it don't
[55:37] even listen to his foolishness if it's
[55:40] not the word of god then you don't
[55:42] listen to it it's not just to show
[55:45] saints you stay in those texts i mean
[55:47] you stay in those conducting orders you
[55:50] stay in those church ages you stay in
[55:52] those seals um god is moving you into
[55:55] something you're going to find out
[55:57] there's nothing going to come out of you
[55:59] but the word is that right you're going
[56:01] to understand satan's tactics you're
[56:04] going to recognize how he's trying to
[56:06] come against you
[56:08] hallelujah
[56:09] you're in a real war spiritual war
[56:13] hallelujah he said now look
[56:16] he says
[56:18] that's the main thing
[56:20] to learn to keep
[56:21] the punches off of you see as much as
[56:25] you can
[56:26] okay
[56:27] he said now look
[56:29] he said there has been he said now let
[56:32] us look
[56:33] now
[56:34] there's not a day that's been like this
[56:37] day
[56:38] i don't believe there ever was a day
[56:41] that i've ever read in history that's
[56:44] been greater
[56:46] the greater days of persecution
[56:50] when the children of god was put to
[56:52] death on every hand
[56:54] but to see
[56:55] the deceitfulness
[56:59] see back in that time if you was a
[57:02] christian and you got over there and
[57:05] then
[57:06] they were so annoying it and they were
[57:08] so in love with god
[57:11] god
[57:12] at that time for them to stand for the
[57:15] word of god because they was a christian
[57:18] they would put in the lion's den or
[57:20] somewhere they were slaughtering but
[57:23] they felt nothing because the anointing
[57:25] of the lord was there to allow them to
[57:29] do those things
[57:30] we saying that's why the last time we
[57:32] was here we talked about preparation
[57:35] moses says them they couldn't move into
[57:37] what god called them to do until the
[57:40] anointing came on them david could not
[57:43] move until god told him to do until the
[57:45] anointing came on him they could not
[57:49] sham guard couldn't do what god was he
[57:52] was sick and tired of the devil taking
[57:55] their crops he could not move until the
[57:58] anointing came down on him the letter
[58:02] killer but the spirit given life
[58:06] we're talking about now about this holy
[58:09] ghost this holy ghost is real that's why
[58:12] he said when the when the holy ghost had
[58:14] a pastor talking about what the
[58:16] intellectual side is that right and then
[58:19] he talked about the uh um side with the
[58:22] pentecostal is that right some judgment
[58:24] said you received the word you received
[58:27] the word and then you got the holy ghost
[58:29] because you're walking in the end time
[58:31] message no no no no no no no no
[58:35] brother brian i'm saying why the power
[58:38] comes
[58:39] then you receive the word
[58:42] that's the sign of the holy ghost then
[58:44] being there
[58:45] say everything that he said huh
[58:47] we got to understand now he sent what
[58:51] those seals to fill every gap
[58:56] we're going to read something about this
[58:57] intellectual demon we're going to read
[59:00] something about these religious demons
[59:02] just bear witness tonight
[59:04] he's not because when the holy ghost
[59:06] tell you you're in the outer court
[59:08] justification
[59:10] nobody's de-christianizing you
[59:16] he's only trying to show you where
[59:18] you're at
[59:20] is that right
[59:22] huh and then they couldn't go anywhere
[59:25] when
[59:26] when marion had the leprosy and they put
[59:29] the leprosy on it for seven days they
[59:31] couldn't go nowhere is that right
[59:33] because she had the leprosy we can't go
[59:36] nowhere if any y'all still in
[59:38] justification how are we gonna move we
[59:41] can't leave you we're not gonna lose the
[59:44] world your family
[59:49] [Music]
[59:50] let us think in
[59:52] when sanctification comes
[59:55] huh
[59:56] say by the washing of the water of the
[59:58] world
[59:59] when that comes in he's only showing you
[1:00:03] where you're at
[1:00:06] so you can catch up
[1:00:08] and there they come with the what
[1:00:10] someday they got the baptism of the holy
[1:00:12] ghost
[1:00:13] is that right
[1:00:14] and still living like the devil
[1:00:17] stop lying on god the holy ghost is
[1:00:20] power
[1:00:23] power to walk right power to talk right
[1:00:26] power delivery right power to think
[1:00:29] right power to sing right power to do
[1:00:31] right it's power
[1:00:33] [Applause]
[1:00:35] it's all about the power of god now
[1:00:37] dwelling inside of someone huh but he
[1:00:40] can't dwell in an unclean vessel
[1:00:43] he won't do it
[1:00:45] hallelujah anyhow
[1:00:53] help me lord
[1:00:54] he said look but to see
[1:00:57] but to see the deceitfulness of the
[1:00:59] enemy
[1:01:01] we've never had a day like this
[1:01:04] we're now living in you see he says
[1:01:07] it's the most cunning deceitful day
[1:01:11] and
[1:01:12] and when
[1:01:13] i see that it brings this that christian
[1:01:17] has to be more
[1:01:18] on his toes today
[1:01:24] than ever was in any age
[1:01:29] huh
[1:01:31] satan coming to knock you out let me

[1:01:35] first
