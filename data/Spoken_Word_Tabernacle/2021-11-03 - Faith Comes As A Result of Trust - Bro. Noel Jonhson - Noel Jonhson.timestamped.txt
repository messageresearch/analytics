[32:34] whispering mercy in the cloud

[32:42] amen
[32:43] amen
[32:45] it's amazing
[32:46] if you look through the scripture you

[32:50] has been
[32:51] hidden
[32:52] many places in the scripture amen even
[32:55] in the zodiac you have the cloud of
[32:57] seven angels so it has been perfect in
[32:59] the zodiac perfect in the pyramid
[33:02] perfect in the written word it's all
[33:04] over the scripture it just takes a
[33:06] matter of revelation amen
[33:09] so where have you been living in
[33:11] humanistic
[33:13] revelation
[33:15] who reach into the visions
[33:18] [Laughter]
[33:20] who is in a vision
[33:22] not yet
[33:24] [Laughter]
[33:26] somebody is confessing at least
[33:29] who lives in a revelation
[33:31] so nobody in humanistic
[33:33] no more thinking and reasoning and
[33:37] pondering and trying to figure it out or
[33:40] things like that
[33:41] amen
[33:43] blessed be the name of the lord
[33:45] the three reigns no more humanistic
[33:48] you did it for years it didn't help you
[33:51] cause you a lot of headache
[33:53] sometimes he works a little bit and then
[33:55] before you know it something is hunting
[33:56] you back and biting at you
[33:59] amen
[34:00] revelation is better because you walk by
[34:03] faith and not by
[34:08] in other words you walk in the realm of
[34:10] revelation and not in a humanistic way
[34:13] that's what paul said walk by faith and
[34:16] not by
[34:18] sight is your greatest enemy
[34:21] amen
[34:22] no
[34:23] who was it i believe it's jonah who say
[34:25] i ever think that was compassing him
[34:27] about where lying
[34:30] how can you call lying vanity you in a
[34:33] belly of a fish
[34:37] you see
[34:38] how which gps did he have to know where
[34:41] where the the temple was
[34:45] where
[34:46] which gps how did he know the north for
[34:48] the south for the east or the west
[34:51] you see what faith can do to you
[34:53] he can even give you a perfect gps
[34:56] when you don't have no direction nothing
[34:59] no label no landmark that would tell you
[35:02] either you're going to go this way or
[35:03] they will be going this way all you need
[35:05] is faith
[35:07] because with faith
[35:08] it's impossible there's nothing nothing
[35:11] nothing that's going to stand on your
[35:13] way amen so keep praying lord's willing
[35:16] we will catch up on sunday
[35:18] and then see how we can climb a little
[35:21] bit more amen
[35:22] blessed be the name of the lord tonight
[35:24] we have brother noel johnson you saw him
[35:28] here before and i miss him
[35:31] if i want to blame probably was because
[35:33] but greg didn't tell me here the time
[35:36] so he was on the service amen
[35:38] so
[35:39] by god's grace we managed to catch him
[35:41] right on time when he is available so
[35:44] extended our open door and he will be
[35:47] the one ministering for us tonight so
[35:50] sister shirley is here we appreciate you
[35:52] you're not visitors we don't have
[35:54] visitors in this church you're just part
[35:56] of the big family of jesus christ amen
[36:03] amen
[36:05] so we came from somewhere and we are
[36:07] going
[36:09] back to god everybody clear
[36:11] yeah for the young man i believe there
[36:13] was only six responses if i have
[36:16] understood correctly you need please to
[36:20] respond to the text when you get it not
[36:23] look and say i got the message if you
[36:26] got a message you say yes or no just say
[36:28] no or say yes so we know only six people
[36:31] responded if you would please respond
[36:34] and talk to the deacon then we will see
[36:36] what will do for the young brothers
[36:39] meeting amen
[36:41] one question
[36:42] on a page
[36:44] not one page with four questions
[36:47] amen so make sure you got one note
[36:50] notepad you write just one you put it
[36:53] there so it will give somebody else a
[36:55] chance
[36:56] to pull their question if not we will
[36:58] get one individual and go through ten
[37:00] questions and we're not going to be able
[37:02] to be reaching to the other and it might
[37:04] take three months before we get there so
[37:06] if you want to write five ten questions
[37:09] that's fine but make sure they in one
[37:11] post card each one so the deacon will
[37:13] get them and
[37:14] shout for them and
[37:16] bring it to me like prayer request
[37:18] or like what was it the prayer request
[37:20] with brother branham or the line of
[37:23] prayer they will move them around and
[37:25] hand it to me and we go from there amen
[37:28] so just do your best i know we need some
[37:30] time you need to make some time so we'll
[37:32] be okay if we go one one weekend a month

[42:20] and we know that we are not under iran
[42:24] or levitical priesthood we now under
[42:28] melchizedek priesthood
[42:30] and we have also a
[42:32] high priest
[42:34] and a high priest

[43:34] that went down to the skirt of his
[43:36] garment
[43:37] the train
[43:39] brother random say represented the
[43:41] angels
[43:46] so the anointing start from the head
[43:48] all the way to the
[43:53] as they do of herman
[43:56] the scripture is really hidden and as
[43:59] they do that descended upon the
[44:01] mountains plural of zion do you know
[44:04] what harmonies
[44:09] have you searched herman
[44:11] okay as they do of hermann and as they

[44:18] the lord commanded the blessing what
[44:22] blessing even life
[44:25] forever
[44:26] more look what unity is

[44:44] preacher let's go to act chapter one
[44:48] warm you up a little bit
[44:52] if you're there you can say amen
[44:56] act
[44:57] chapter one
[45:00] go to chapter two
[45:02] sorry verse one
[45:05] and when the day of what
[45:08] was fully
[45:10] they were all
[45:12] in division
[45:20] how were there
[45:22] one accord so everybody was in
[45:26] so if unity is like the anointing all
[45:29] right let's see what this unity does
[45:32] and let's see what the high priest did
[45:35] when he saw his children in
[45:39] and when the day of pentecost was fully
[45:41] come they were all with
[45:44] one accord
[45:46] in
[45:48] the same place
[45:50] and all of them in
[45:53] what did he do
[45:55] verse two
[45:56] and suddenly
[45:58] there came a sound from what
[46:01] as of a rushing muddy wind
[46:05] and he feel all the house where they
[46:07] were sitting
[46:09] and they appear unto them clothing
[46:12] tongues like as of fire
[46:14] and he sat upon each of them
[46:18] and they were all
[46:21] with their
[46:26] unity
[46:29] it's pleasant it's good
[46:31] for the brother to draw together in
[46:34] it's like the anointing all
[46:36] the unity and the day of pentecost under
[46:39] the promise of god
[46:41] under the command of god go sit there
[46:44] stay there in jerusalem when we obey
[46:47] that command and we come together in
[46:49] agreement in unity
[46:51] look what he pulls down
[46:53] then that anointing that was on the
[46:55] priest
[46:56] could not stay no longer on the priest
[46:58] he was running down from the priests
[47:01] head which is crushed the head of the
[47:03] church then he's going to run down upon
[47:05] the
[47:06] body he gathered on the pentecost
[47:09] everybody clear
[47:10] then at the end it must go to the feet
[47:13] the angel must come
[47:18] till the end time that anointing will
[47:20] come with the angel
[47:22] in the skirt and it's like the dew of
[47:25] hermann
[47:27] you search her herman in the scripture
[47:29] and you'll see that herman is another
[47:31] name for ma
[47:33] zion
[47:36] you see now
[47:38] jerusalem
[47:40] they were all in jerusalem

[48:00] let's call brother noel
[48:02] only believe
[48:04] [Music]
[48:14] [Music]
[48:19] things are possible
[48:22] [Music]
[48:24] only
[48:25] [Music]
[48:27] believe
[48:32] [Music]
[48:33] [Applause]
[48:36] oh
[48:38] [Music]
[48:39] [Applause]
[48:40] [Music]
[48:57] lord i believe
[49:00] [Music]
[49:03] lord i
[49:05] believe
[49:08] that all things are
[49:12] possible
[49:16] i
[49:18] believe
[49:22] lord i believe
[49:28] lord i believe
[49:33] so all
[49:35] things
[49:39] [Music]
[49:49] i want to greet you all in the name of
[49:50] the lord jesus christ
[49:52] and it's my privilege to be amongst you
[49:54] this evening
[49:56] while you're standing if you'd open your
[49:57] bibles to romans the fifth chapter read
[50:00] verses one and two
[50:02] and the subject matter is faith comes as
[50:04] a result of trust
[50:07] i did a study on the book of habakkuk a
[50:10] number of years a couple years ago
[50:12] anyway
[50:13] and that changed my whole concept of
[50:15] what faith is
[50:17] faith is not believing for something
[50:20] it's believing in
[50:22] someone
[50:23] and hopefully that'll make more senses
[50:25] as we get into the scriptures
[50:27] so romans 5 reading verses one and two
[50:30] it says therefore being justified by
[50:32] faith we have peace with god through our
[50:34] lord jesus christ
[50:35] by whom we have access by faith through
[50:38] through this grace wherein we stand and
[50:41] rejoice in the hope of the glory of god
[50:44] and let's just pray
[50:47] our most gracious and loving heavenly
[50:49] father it is always our privilege
[50:51] to gather ourselves together around your
[50:53] word and to sit at your feet
[50:56] and to receive what you have for us
[50:58] you've chosen to minister through men
[51:01] but lord we are imperfect
[51:04] but lord you are the perfect one and you
[51:06] are the preacher and so lord it's asking
[51:08] you to come this night
[51:10] and guide the thoughts of my mind and
[51:12] the words which are spoken
[51:14] the lord they wouldn't be mine but lord
[51:15] they would be yours
[51:17] the lord we might be able to comprehend
[51:19] more fully just what it means to have
[51:21] faith
[51:22] and then lord to be able to trust in you
[51:24] for all things
[51:26] grant this lord for i ask it in jesus
[51:28] christ's name
[51:29] amen amen you can be seated
[51:36] says here being justified by faith we
[51:38] have peace with god through our lord
[51:40] jesus christ
[51:42] when we talk about being at peace it
[51:44] means nothing bothers us
[51:46] nothing disturbs us
[51:48] we are at peace we are at rest things
[51:50] will come around us and problems will
[51:52] arise and then our world is will to go
[51:54] upside down if you will
[51:56] but yet we will at peace because we have
[51:59] faith
[52:00] because we have come to a relationship
[52:03] with jesus christ
[52:04] that nothing bothers us
[52:07] that is when we look at brother
[52:08] branham's life and i look at
[52:10] his life and the things that he has gone
[52:12] through
[52:12] i realized this is what he where he had
[52:14] to come
[52:15] because he had to come to a place in his
[52:17] relationship with god where nothing
[52:19] bothered him
[52:20] where he knew something would have
[52:22] something happened or something would
[52:23] disturb or he said somebody asked he
[52:25] says he said well the civil devil is
[52:27] hindering us he says well maybe not
[52:29] maybe it's god trying to tell us
[52:30] something
[52:31] and so here again but see brother
[52:33] branham could look beyond circumstances
[52:36] and he could begin to realize god is the
[52:38] one who was in control
[52:40] we look at the world we're in today we
[52:42] look at our government and the chaos
[52:44] that exist there if i did not believe
[52:47] that god was the one in control
[52:49] i would go crazy
[52:51] because nothing is making sense
[52:54] i mean it it's you don't know what
[52:56] tomorrow will bring i mean literally you
[52:58] don't know what tomorrow will bring he
[53:00] could write a little edict and say okay
[53:02] because of such and such and such and
[53:04] such we're going to ground all their
[53:05] airplanes
[53:07] they did that in india
[53:09] in one day overnight the government of
[53:11] india shut down all transportation they
[53:13] said down the airlines they shut down
[53:15] the railway they shut down the buses
[53:17] they shut down the taxis
[53:19] you wanted to go someplace you walked
[53:23] people would go
[53:24] people who
[53:26] people who hired men to go into
[53:29] do different jobs they would go into
[53:31] villages they would hire the men which
[53:33] are able-bodied and they would take them
[53:35] different places and some of them would
[53:36] be four or 500 miles from home
[53:39] and when they shut down all the
[53:40] transportation they had to walk home
[53:43] there was no transportation
[53:46] one guy happened to be in in africa
[53:49] it took him six months to get home
[53:52] finally they opened up one airline was
[53:54] able to fly into i think it was it was
[53:56] bombay
[53:58] and there he had to rent a car to drive
[54:01] all the way to the other side of india
[54:02] so he could get home
[54:04] but he was the and and a bunch of people
[54:07] got together to help rent the car
[54:09] because that was the only means of
[54:10] transportation there was but see our
[54:12] government could do the same i mean
[54:13] we're in the same situation
[54:16] but it comes down to the place and now
[54:17] it come we're talking about having faith
[54:19] but it comes to having a relationship
[54:22] with jesus christ because without that
[54:25] relationship you cannot be at peace
[54:27] but that that relationship the world
[54:29] will bother you and all the
[54:30] circumstances in your life they will
[54:32] bother you
[54:33] but if you understand god is in control
[54:35] you understand god is the one in charge
[54:38] of all things
[54:39] then you can be at rest
[54:42] you know but one of the struggles we
[54:43] have in our life is trying to have faith
[54:46] for something this is generally how we
[54:48] apply faith we get sick oh i need to
[54:50] have faith for healing i need to have
[54:52] faith for healing and so we try and
[54:53] generate something within ourselves to
[54:55] believe god's promise so that he'll heal
[54:58] us
[54:59] but see that is not that's the wrong
[55:01] atom that's the wrong way to approach
[55:02] this
[55:04] brother branham in the exposition of the
[55:06] seven church ages he says
[55:08] he says we need to call on god for
[55:10] revelation more than anything else in
[55:11] the world
[55:12] he says we have accepted the bible we
[55:14] have accepted the great truths of it but
[55:16] it is still not real to most people
[55:18] because the revelation by the spirit is
[55:20] not there
[55:22] the word has not been a quicken the
[55:24] bible said in ii corinthians 5 21 that
[55:27] we have become the very righteousness of
[55:29] god by our union with jesus christ he
[55:31] said did you get that he says it says we
[55:34] are the very righteousness of god
[55:36] himself
[55:37] by being in
[55:39] christ
[55:42] we have become we are the very
[55:44] righteousness of god himself
[55:47] by being in christ
[55:49] okay
[55:51] he says it says that jesus became became
[55:53] sin for us it does not say he became
[55:55] sinful but he came sin for us that by
[55:58] our union with him why me we might
[55:59] become the righteousness of god he says
[56:02] if we accept the fact and we must
[56:05] that he literally became sin for us by
[56:07] his substitution for us
[56:09] then we must also accept the fact that
[56:11] by our union with him we are the very
[56:14] righteousness of god
[56:16] to reject one
[56:18] is to reject the other
[56:20] to accept the one
[56:22] is to accept the other
[56:25] he said now we know the bible says that
[56:27] and
[56:28] it can't be denied he said but the
[56:29] revelation of it is missing and it's not
[56:32] it is not real to the majority of god's
[56:34] children it is just a good verse in the
[56:36] bible
[56:37] but see here again to me the problem
[56:39] comes down
[56:41] why isn't it real to us
[56:45] why do we struggle with salvation
[56:48] why do we struggle believing we are the
[56:50] very righteousness of god
[56:53] because we say oh we believe the bible
[56:55] well that's true
[56:56] but see i have come to the understanding
[56:58] if i have faith in in god
[57:01] and i believe that what he has said is
[57:04] true
[57:05] then i don't look at myself anymore i
[57:07] look at him
[57:09] because he is the one who has made the
[57:11] pro the proclamation he is the one that
[57:14] says i am
[57:16] in myself i say well no this can't be
[57:18] possible i mean i look at myself
[57:21] but then i have to go back to the word
[57:22] brother brown says it's better for you
[57:24] to believe what god says you are
[57:26] than what you think that you are
[57:29] and see but see this is our struggle
[57:32] why do we have faith why do we have why
[57:34] do we have why do we struggle to have
[57:36] faith in god to believe for something
[57:39] it's because we're always looking at us
[57:42] we keep looking at our shortcomings we
[57:43] keep looking at our faults really
[57:44] keeping our faith and we all have them
[57:46] you know welcome to the human race okay
[57:50] but if we can begin to comprehend what
[57:52] god is and what god has said
[57:55] and if you have trust in him and what he
[57:57] has said then there's no more argument
[58:00] because what he has said has to be true
[58:04] because he cannot lie
[58:06] [Music]
[58:10] when we go and we tell we just look at
[58:11] this what paul said here um it says
[58:14] therefore being justified which brother
[58:16] brown says is it's as if you never sin
[58:18] okay which is what he was talking about
[58:20] there in in in what he said in the
[58:22] church ages or in the in the church but
[58:24] church age book he says therefore being
[58:26] justified by faith it says we have peace
[58:28] or we are at rest or through jesus
[58:30] christ
[58:31] and when i when i read that verse i
[58:33] figured well that's interesting but
[58:34] where does where was paul quoting this
[58:36] from
[58:37] and that's found in havoc the second
[58:39] chapter verse 4
[58:41] it says behold his soul which is lifted
[58:43] up is not upright in him but the just
[58:46] shall live by his faith
[58:48] and this is where paul took this thing
[58:50] if therefore by by faith we believe okay
[58:53] but he's going back to habakkuk
[58:56] and habakkuk is only three chapters it's
[58:58] it's not a very big book
[59:00] but yet habakkuk lived in the time of of
[59:03] jeremiah before the destruction of
[59:04] jerusalem
[59:06] and god had taken habakkuk and and him
[59:09] to have a good being a prophet god had
[59:10] showed him all the sins and the iniquity
[59:12] and the hypocrisy of the priesthood
[59:14] and habakkuk's righteous indignation
[59:16] rose up and says lord why don't you
[59:17] bring judgment on these people
[59:19] i mean how god how can you being holy
[59:22] and righteous and pure how can you
[59:23] tolerate this mess
[59:25] and so god says well you know that's a
[59:27] good suggestion i'm paraphrasing okay
[59:29] he says that's a good suggestion i think
[59:31] i'll bring judgment and habit hooks is
[59:33] great you see i'm going to send the
[59:35] chaldeans
[59:36] oh no no no no you don't want to do that
[59:39] no no because they're not nice people
[59:42] they kill because they like to kill
[59:44] when they come into a city they destroy
[59:46] everything man woman child it doesn't
[59:48] matter
[59:49] and so and and so all of a sudden you
[59:52] know habakkuk became fearful for himself
[59:55] and that's why and then god spoke down
[59:56] into him and says behold the soul which
[59:58] is lifted up is not upright but the just
[1:00:00] shall live by his faith
[1:00:02] he's telling habakkuk you have to have
[1:00:04] faith in me
[1:00:06] you have to literally trust me
[1:00:09] for your very survival
[1:00:12] i read in a commentary and it's and says
[1:00:14] he whose soul is not right in him
[1:00:16] in him places himself in a fortress or
[1:00:18] tower to set himself on high uh there
[1:00:22] from the enemy and does not return to
[1:00:24] god nor seek deliverance from him
[1:00:26] in other words the man says i can do
[1:00:28] this myself
[1:00:30] i can i'm you know oh yeah we've had
[1:00:31] troubles before i survived i've survived
[1:00:34] the other trouble yeah i'll survive this
[1:00:36] one no problem you know i can take care
[1:00:38] of myself in other words i don't need
[1:00:39] god
[1:00:41] and the man and god says if you are of
[1:00:43] that opinion
[1:00:44] i will let you alone
[1:00:45] i will take my hands off of you
[1:00:48] and i'll let you do what you do your own
[1:00:49] thing
[1:00:51] but he said but it says the person who
[1:00:53] who will trust me
[1:00:55] i will provide for him i will watch over
[1:00:59] him i will take care of him
[1:01:02] and so god is telling habakkuk you have
[1:01:04] to trust me
[1:01:06] you have to come to a relationship with
[1:01:09] me that you put your total trust and
[1:01:11] reliance upon me as your god
[1:01:14] and so often when we when we begin to
[1:01:16] apply that into our own lives we say
[1:01:18] well yeah you know
[1:01:20] we may not realize it but we are trying
[1:01:22] to justify ourselves
[1:01:25] we're trying oh yeah you know if i read
[1:01:27] my bible every day then god will look
[1:01:28] favorably upon me or if i do this god
[1:01:30] will be favorable upon me if i do this
[1:01:32] and god will be favorable toward me and
[1:01:34] so we're trying to earn
[1:01:36] you don't earn favors from god
[1:01:39] you don't earn salvation from god
[1:01:42] salvation is a free gift which god gives
[1:01:45] you because of what he has done at
[1:01:47] calvary
[1:01:49] god heals you because he allowed the
[1:01:52] stripes to be put on jesus's back he
[1:01:54] already purchased your healing
[1:01:57] all you have to do is believe it
[1:02:01] so why don't we believe it
[1:02:03] because we don't trust him
[1:02:07] i mean to me this is where it all comes
[1:02:08] back to
[1:02:09] if we trusted god
[1:02:11] if literally we trusted god and we began
[1:02:14] to realize that our very existence is
[1:02:16] relying upon him
[1:02:20] then everything else becomes becomes
[1:02:21] different
[1:02:22] god says i'm healed
[1:02:24] well than i am
[1:02:27] i mean i mean it can't be anything but
[1:02:29] that
[1:02:30] i mean god can't lie
[1:02:33] so god says the stripes laid on his back
[1:02:35] he purchased my healing
[1:02:37] well therefore i am healed
[1:02:39] oh but you still have symptoms
[1:02:42] well that's just a lie of the devil
[1:02:44] because god says i'm healed
[1:02:47] and and see this is where it has to come
[1:02:49] in our lives this is what has to come in
[1:02:51] our thinking
[1:02:52] it has to come to the realization where
[1:02:54] we literally trust god
[1:02:56] where if god said something in his word
[1:02:58] god cannot lie and therefore we have
[1:03:00] total confidence in that god to bring to
[1:03:03] pass what that god has said
[1:03:10] you know it talks brother jesus christ
[1:03:12] talks about a man who relies on himself
[1:03:15] and this is found in luke the 18th
[1:03:16] chapter verses 9 through 14 and i'll
[1:03:19] paraphrase this also
[1:03:20] he says he says there's two people went
[1:03:22] into the temp near the temple to pray he
[1:03:24] says one was a pharisee and the other
[1:03:26] one was republican
[1:03:28] now pharisee was the righteous of the
[1:03:30] righteous
[1:03:31] they kept all of the law and and even
[1:03:33] then some okay the publican on the other
[1:03:36] hand was the tax collector
[1:03:38] he was the jew he was a jew who took and
[1:03:41] took money from his own people to give
[1:03:43] it to rome so he was he was a traitor to
[1:03:45] his own people
[1:03:47] and so he here's the examples that jesus
[1:03:49] christ was using
[1:03:50] and so the pharisee went up into the
[1:03:52] temple to pray
[1:03:53] and he stood up and thus prayed within
[1:03:55] himself and says god
[1:03:57] i thank you that i am not as all these
[1:03:59] other men are
[1:04:00] extorted unjust adulterers and bloody
[1:04:03] dotty dolls even as this
[1:04:06] republican over here
[1:04:07] i fast twice in the week give tithes of
[1:04:09] all that i possess and he would list on
[1:04:11] and on and on and on and on
[1:04:14] he was trying to he was trying to tell
[1:04:16] god i am righteous
[1:04:18] because of what i have done
[1:04:21] and god says no and then he goes on and
[1:04:23] the public and standing afar off would
[1:04:24] not lift up so much as his eyes to
[1:04:26] heaven but smote him on his breath
[1:04:28] saying god be merciful to me
[1:04:30] a sinner
[1:04:31] and jesus as i tell you this man went
[1:04:33] down to house justified
[1:04:36] just as if he never sinned
[1:04:38] rather than the other and everyone that
[1:04:40] because everyone that exalts himself
[1:04:42] will be based and he but he that will
[1:04:44] humble himself god will exalt
[1:04:46] and scofield has a has a footnote in his
[1:04:49] bible when he when he looks at this
[1:04:51] prayer of the publican
[1:04:52] he said be toward me as thou lookest
[1:04:54] upon the atoning blood
[1:04:58] he was not relying upon himself he
[1:05:00] wasn't replying upon his works he was
[1:05:03] relying upon the sacrifice which had
[1:05:05] been taken and the blood had been placed
[1:05:07] upon the mercy seat
[1:05:08] he's saying don't you even begin to look
[1:05:10] at me because i have nothing to offer
[1:05:12] you
[1:05:13] but look at the atoning blood that's
[1:05:14] been placed there and on the basis of
[1:05:16] that
[1:05:17] regard me
[1:05:19] but see this is where we have to come in
[1:05:21] our lives
[1:05:22] god don't look at me
[1:05:24] because i have nothing to offer you
[1:05:27] i'm a failure in so many things in so
[1:05:29] many areas of my life
[1:05:32] but yet lord you went to calvary
[1:05:35] and you became the sacrifice for my sins
[1:05:39] and because you were willing to die for
[1:05:41] my sins
[1:05:42] therefore you have paid the price for my
[1:05:44] sins and therefore i am righteous
[1:05:46] because you have said that i am
[1:05:48] righteous
[1:05:49] it's not me looking at myself it's not
[1:05:52] me trying to say that i how great i am
[1:05:54] and all these other things no is looking
[1:05:56] and beginning to realize what god
[1:05:58] accomplished for us at the cross
[1:06:01] i go to the cross many times a day
[1:06:04] because everything i need that is where
[1:06:06] i will find it
[1:06:08] if i need healing well lord you already
[1:06:10] paid the price because of the stripes on
[1:06:12] your back
[1:06:13] lord i made mistakes today but you
[1:06:15] already because of your sacrifice at
[1:06:17] calvary you've already paid for my sins
[1:06:20] and therefore i confess my sins and
[1:06:21] therefore you will forgive me my sins
[1:06:23] and cleanse me from all unrighteous and
[1:06:25] will you we will establish the
[1:06:26] relationship between you between him and
[1:06:28] i
[1:06:30] but see this it has to come to this in
[1:06:32] our life
[1:06:33] it's like i won't ask it here because i
[1:06:35] only get half the response i asked a few
[1:06:37] congregations how many here got up this
[1:06:39] morning you know about half the people
[1:06:40] rose their hands i figure well the other
[1:06:42] one's obvious you didn't but you know
[1:06:44] you're here anyway
[1:06:46] um and but how many how many here had
[1:06:48] food today and well
[1:06:50] more of them actually had food you know
[1:06:52] okay
[1:06:53] but the thing of it is why did you get
[1:06:55] up
[1:06:57] because god woke you up
[1:07:00] [Music]
[1:07:01] why did you eat today
[1:07:04] because god provided you food
[1:07:06] oh but i work for i work for a living i
[1:07:08] make all this money
[1:07:10] well who gave you the job
[1:07:14] who gave you the help
[1:07:16] who gave the ability to do the things
[1:07:18] that you are doing
[1:07:23] i mean i i have looked at other people
[1:07:25] in their lives not not to judge
[1:07:28] but you know some of the people says oh
[1:07:30] yeah look at what i have created look at
[1:07:32] what i have done you know look at how
[1:07:34] successful i have been and all these
[1:07:35] other types of things
[1:07:37] but you know all it takes because we
[1:07:39] like we used to i work in a hospital
[1:07:40] laboratory
[1:07:42] and the businesses would go and they
[1:07:44] would they would do health screenings
[1:07:46] um
[1:07:47] and so we would run 50 or 60
[1:07:50] specimens of
[1:07:52] from a company through
[1:07:53] and uh we were doing one person so i
[1:07:55] noticed
[1:07:57] this guy has leukemia
[1:08:00] he didn't know it leukemia has no
[1:08:02] symptoms
[1:08:05] but all of a sudden we looked at the
[1:08:06] blood work i said this guy has leukemia
[1:08:09] and it's advanced
[1:08:11] and so we sent the report off so this
[1:08:12] guy would show up to work the next day
[1:08:14] and they would call him in the office
[1:08:15] and say
[1:08:16] we had a health screening yeah yeah yeah
[1:08:18] i feel great what's going on
[1:08:20] he says you need to go see your doctor
[1:08:21] you only have about three months to live
[1:08:25] that changed his whole outlook on work
[1:08:28] it changed his whole outlook on
[1:08:29] everything
[1:08:31] i know my brother when he was gonna
[1:08:33] planning for retirement he wanted to
[1:08:34] work a couple more years and stuff
[1:08:38] and uh all of a sudden he had a heart
[1:08:40] attack
[1:08:42] and uh
[1:08:43] his his his wife his her um
[1:08:47] her brothers one of a couple of them are
[1:08:49] doctors and stuff
[1:08:50] and so she called up her brother and
[1:08:52] says hey this is the symptoms my my
[1:08:55] lyle's having
[1:08:56] and he listen he says get him to the
[1:08:58] emergency now
[1:09:00] don't wait for nothing get him there now
[1:09:02] so she drove him to the hospital walked
[1:09:04] him in there a doctor was just prepping
[1:09:06] himself to do a heart cath on a patient
[1:09:09] and when my brother walked in there and
[1:09:11] they saw him in the middle of having a
[1:09:13] heart attack they wheeled him in five
[1:09:15] minutes later and he was on the table
[1:09:16] and they did ended a heart calf on him
[1:09:20] if
[1:09:20] that doctor had not only been prepped
[1:09:23] my brother would not have lived
[1:09:26] that changed his whole outlook on life
[1:09:29] that changed all the plans that he had
[1:09:31] ever made
[1:09:32] all of us said now he realized the only
[1:09:34] reason he was alive was because god
[1:09:36] allowed him
[1:09:38] to live
[1:09:41] but and sometimes it takes that action
[1:09:43] within our lives for us to be able to
[1:09:46] acknowledge that god is the only
[1:09:47] supplier of the life that we have
[1:09:50] if it was not for god we would not be
[1:09:52] alive it was not for god we would not
[1:09:54] have jobs if it was not for god we
[1:09:56] really would have nothing
[1:09:58] and so it's the it's learning to
[1:10:00] acknowledge god in all things
[1:10:03] that really we glorify him and the
[1:10:05] things which we do
[1:10:07] you know brother branham asked how long
[1:10:09] does healing last
[1:10:11] he says as long as you have faith
[1:10:14] he says how long does salvation last
[1:10:16] as long as you have faith
[1:10:19] if you no longer believe you're saved
[1:10:21] you're lost
[1:10:23] if you no longer believe you're healed
[1:10:24] then you're not
[1:10:26] it takes a continuous believing it takes
[1:10:29] a continual struggle within our lives
[1:10:31] because brother bradham even struggled
[1:10:33] with this
[1:10:34] he said sometimes he says i feel so low
[1:10:36] and so bad
[1:10:38] but he says
[1:10:39] he says when i get to that point he says
[1:10:41] how do i know that i'm saved
[1:10:43] he said i go back to the scriptures and
[1:10:45] i realize this is the requirements god
[1:10:47] has placed and i've met those
[1:10:48] requirements therefore i am saved
[1:10:51] he didn't look at the fact that he was a
[1:10:53] prophet he didn't look at the fact how
[1:10:54] god ministered through him he didn't
[1:10:56] look about anything else he went back to
[1:10:58] the word
[1:10:59] he said based upon the word i have
[1:11:01] salvation
[1:11:02] so it's upon the word of god he rested
[1:11:05] his faith
[1:11:06] and that's where we have that's where we
[1:11:08] have to come
[1:11:12] in going through the scriptures i began
[1:11:15] to look at the lives of of different
[1:11:16] people
[1:11:18] and why did abraham have faith
[1:11:21] um we know that god spoke to him and we
[1:11:24] don't know in what form and he was at 75
[1:11:26] years of age when finally he finally
[1:11:28] left heron and and turned it into the
[1:11:29] promised land
[1:11:31] and god had told him i want you to leave
[1:11:32] your family and your your place of your
[1:11:35] nativity and stuff like that well
[1:11:37] he didn't exactly obey like you know
[1:11:39] jump to it and do it
[1:11:41] um he got into the into the cane in the
[1:11:44] into the promised land into canaan and
[1:11:46] they were in the middle of a famine so
[1:11:47] he said well this isn't much of a nice
[1:11:49] place to live at so we went down into
[1:11:50] egypt
[1:11:51] but god says no i didn't call you to
[1:11:53] live in egypt
[1:11:55] i called you to live in the promised
[1:11:57] land
[1:11:58] god has not called us to live in egypt
[1:12:00] in the world in ourselves in our
[1:12:02] abilities no he has called us to live in
[1:12:05] in canaan land which brother brahms is
[1:12:06] represents the holy spirit
[1:12:08] it's in the holy spirit we are to live
[1:12:11] it is in the holy spirit we are to have
[1:12:13] our existence it's in the holy spirit
[1:12:16] that we are to be in communion with god
[1:12:18] and and by that we are we are to be to
[1:12:20] be able to to access god and be able to
[1:12:22] believe unto and god for all these
[1:12:24] things
[1:12:26] so so abraham finally he got in there
[1:12:29] and and god tried him in different ways
[1:12:32] but it was through the trials that
[1:12:34] abraham went through that he came to the
[1:12:37] place where he began to trust god
[1:12:40] when there was a famine in the land he
[1:12:41] had to say god i need to have water for
[1:12:43] my cattle from my sheep and for the
[1:12:45] other thing lord there's this going on i
[1:12:48] need you i need you to supply here i
[1:12:49] need you to supply there and so over
[1:12:51] time abraham had to come to the faith
[1:12:53] where he had total confidence
[1:12:56] in the god that had called to him
[1:12:59] until finally he came to him after the
[1:13:00] promised land had came he says i want
[1:13:02] you to take your son your only son
[1:13:04] and i want you to take him up and offer
[1:13:06] him for a sacrifice
[1:13:08] and so abraham says i don't know how
[1:13:10] you're going to keep him alive because
[1:13:11] all my pro all the promises rested in
[1:13:13] him
[1:13:14] he took him up to the mountain and and
[1:13:16] he had the the fire and the wood and
[1:13:18] stuff like that and he took isaac tied
[1:13:21] his hands and put him on top of the pile
[1:13:23] of wood and he was going to slay isaac
[1:13:26] and then god says stay your hand
[1:13:28] but see abraham had had faith he had
[1:13:32] such confidence in god
[1:13:34] that even though isaac was reduced to
[1:13:36] ashes
[1:13:38] god would bring him up and restore him
[1:13:40] fully and they would walk back down the
[1:13:43] mountain
[1:13:46] but he had to go through an awful lot to
[1:13:48] come to that place in his life
[1:13:50] where he could have that confidence in
[1:13:52] in god
[1:13:54] we could look at a man named david
[1:13:57] david was out taking care of his dad's
[1:13:59] sheep a lion came in and david ran after
[1:14:02] the lion he killed the lion
[1:14:04] he rescued the lamb
[1:14:06] a little while later however the time
[1:14:08] framing was a bear came in and he went
[1:14:10] after the bear and he killed the bear
[1:14:11] rescuing the lamb why
[1:14:15] why did david have to go through those
[1:14:17] incidences
[1:14:19] because there was a day he was going to
[1:14:21] have to face goliath
[1:14:23] and he had to have confidence in the god
[1:14:25] that had called him
[1:14:27] so that he knew that when he faced
[1:14:29] goliath that he would be able to slay
[1:14:30] the giant and bring deliverance to the
[1:14:32] children of israel
[1:14:34] but see we go through the things we go
[1:14:36] through in our lives in order for us to
[1:14:39] develop us to have the confidence in god
[1:14:42] we have sickness
[1:14:44] and then we pray and god heals
[1:14:47] okay and then we go for the hardship and
[1:14:49] god supplies
[1:14:50] and we go through other circumstances in
[1:14:52] our life and we see the hand of god
[1:14:54] repeatedly coming and taking care of us
[1:14:56] here and taking care of us here and
[1:14:58] healing us here and doing this for us
[1:15:00] and doing that for until it should come
[1:15:01] to the place in our life where we have
[1:15:04] such a relationship with god
[1:15:07] that we literally trust him
[1:15:09] for everything
[1:15:10] [Music]
[1:15:11] then it came to the time that david was
[1:15:13] called he um because he was he was there
[1:15:15] minding his own business and um a
[1:15:18] messenger came from his dad's house and
[1:15:20] says hey your dad wants to see you
[1:15:22] and they would say well okay so he walks
[1:15:24] into his house and
[1:15:25] here's this crazy old man
[1:15:28] with a horn of oil in his hand
[1:15:30] he looks at david the next king of
[1:15:31] israel
[1:15:33] and david looks at him as his oil is
[1:15:35] poured on his head and you know
[1:15:37] king of israel yeah huh yeah uh-huh i've
[1:15:40] heard this one before
[1:15:42] and so then he says thank you i'm going
[1:15:44] to go back and take care of the sheep
[1:15:46] but see god had a plan in his life and
[1:15:48] david did not know this
[1:15:50] so he had to go into the in into the
[1:15:53] king's court
[1:15:54] and there he had to learn what it was
[1:15:56] like to rule a kingdom
[1:15:58] but it got to the place where saul
[1:16:00] became jealous and then tried to kill
[1:16:01] david
[1:16:03] and then david had to run for his life
[1:16:05] and hid out in caves in different places
[1:16:08] but see from that point on in david's
[1:16:10] life he remembered that crazy old man
[1:16:12] that poured that oil all over his head
[1:16:14] and said i was going to be the next king
[1:16:17] well if i'm going to be the next king
[1:16:19] god has to keep me alive
[1:16:22] and god has to watch over me and protect
[1:16:24] me
[1:16:25] and so and so david over time he
[1:16:28] developed this confidence in god
[1:16:30] where he where he believed that what god
[1:16:32] had said god would bring to pass
[1:16:36] we go and i i looked at brother i i
[1:16:38] studied brother branham's life a couple
[1:16:40] years ago because i was curious in his
[1:16:42] life and
[1:16:43] and you know one of these things there's
[1:16:45] garbage going on in the world about you
[1:16:46] know believing the sign all this other
[1:16:48] stupidity
[1:16:51] once you have a relationship of who
[1:16:53] brother branham is
[1:16:56] they can put all this garbage out all
[1:16:57] they want
[1:16:58] [Music]
[1:17:00] i know who he is
[1:17:02] he was the territories messenger
[1:17:05] there is no other there's no under
[1:17:07] coming
[1:17:09] so if you could if you're gonna you're
[1:17:10] gonna approach me with that nonsense
[1:17:11] keep it to yourself i'm not interested
[1:17:13] okay
[1:17:17] [Applause]
[1:17:19] but that but then when you look at
[1:17:20] brother branham's life he was a renegade
[1:17:24] i mean he had a temper
[1:17:26] um
[1:17:28] some kids beat him up he went home got
[1:17:29] his gun and also those kids came around
[1:17:31] the corner and he was a dead shop he
[1:17:33] says every one of you is dead man
[1:17:35] he took his rifle and he could have
[1:17:37] killed every one of them
[1:17:39] but god stopped that
[1:17:41] because there was a calling on his life
[1:17:44] there's other things that went on in his
[1:17:46] life that all of a sudden it tried
[1:17:48] brother branham to the place where
[1:17:50] brother branham had to come to the place
[1:17:52] in his own life that he had to have
[1:17:53] total confidence in the god that had
[1:17:56] called him
[1:17:57] until it reaches wherever he went he
[1:17:59] believed god was there he believed god
[1:18:01] was in charge he believed god was in
[1:18:02] control and then he listened to god and
[1:18:05] so he followed that all
[1:18:06] all through his life
[1:18:09] so the faith that habakkuk speaks about
[1:18:11] here it's it's not a faith it's not
[1:18:13] trying to believe for something
[1:18:16] but it's coming to a real con
[1:18:18] a real confiding faith it's one of
[1:18:21] having a relationship between the
[1:18:23] creature and its creator
[1:18:24] where the creature is totally dependent
[1:18:28] upon his creator
[1:18:29] where you literally you acknowledge him
[1:18:31] in all things you praise him for all
[1:18:33] things and and you believe that no
[1:18:35] matter what is going on in your life god
[1:18:37] is going to work it out for your good
[1:18:39] because that's what god has promised
[1:18:45] at the end of the book of habakkuk in
[1:18:46] chapter 3 verses 16 to 18
[1:18:49] it goes on here when i heard my belly
[1:18:51] trembled my lips quivered at the voice
[1:18:53] rottnest centered into my bones and i
[1:18:55] trembled in myself that i might rest in
[1:18:57] the day of trouble
[1:18:58] when he cometh up unto the people and he
[1:19:00] will invade them and he will invade with
[1:19:02] his troops so he was scared
[1:19:06] i mean when it talks about my lips were
[1:19:08] covering and i was shaking and i was
[1:19:09] nervous and i was wondering about you no
[1:19:11] yeah he was scared
[1:19:13] because he did not know what tomorrow
[1:19:15] would bring
[1:19:16] he did not know when the invasion came
[1:19:18] if he would survive
[1:19:21] but god was coming to the place that
[1:19:22] says for you to survive
[1:19:25] you have to have total trust
[1:19:27] in me
[1:19:28] and for us to survive what's coming
[1:19:32] we have to come to the place where we
[1:19:33] have total confidence in our god
[1:19:37] so it goes on here in habakkuk 3 17 it
[1:19:39] says although the fig tree shall not
[1:19:41] blossom
[1:19:42] neither shall fruit be in the vines
[1:19:44] the labor of the olives shall fail in
[1:19:46] the field shall yield no meat
[1:19:48] the flock shall be cut off from the fold
[1:19:50] and there shall be no herds in the stall
[1:19:52] though there be total devastation
[1:19:56] he goes yet i will rejoice in the lord i
[1:19:58] will joy
[1:20:00] in the god of my salvation
[1:20:03] in the in the commentary that i read it
[1:20:05] says i will i will not rejoice only but
[1:20:07] i will shout for joy and not only so but
[1:20:10] i will bound for joy and not for this
[1:20:12] time only both words express a drawing
[1:20:14] of yearning he says yet he says yet more
[1:20:16] and more i will shout for joy and i will
[1:20:18] and i will jump for joy and and i would
[1:20:20] and and and
[1:20:22] he will he put when he worshipped god
[1:20:24] from what i can gather from habakkuk
[1:20:26] he put his whole self into it
[1:20:28] he would jump and he would shout and he
[1:20:30] would run around the temple and he would
[1:20:31] do all kinds of why because he was
[1:20:33] praising his god
[1:20:45] and he would do that when he had nothing
[1:20:57] [Music]
[1:21:02] so if so if you rejoice in god because
[1:21:05] of your blessings because your
[1:21:07] possessions because of the things that
[1:21:08] you possess and have
[1:21:10] okay what happens when they're all gone
[1:21:15] what happens when you're reduced to
[1:21:17] total poverty
[1:21:19] because to me that's what's coming i
[1:21:22] mean i'm not a prophet i can't predict
[1:21:24] but all i knew is i listened to what
[1:21:25] brother branham said
[1:21:27] and there is a destruction coming that
[1:21:29] this world cannot plan for
[1:21:31] when california goes under as a result
[1:21:33] of an earthquake there will be a tidal
[1:21:35] wave that will sweep the world and
[1:21:37] hundreds of millions of people will die
[1:21:38] within 48 to 72 hours
[1:21:41] florida will be gone california will be
[1:21:43] gone oregon washington will be gone okay
[1:21:47] cal from what i understand even even i
[1:21:49] think phoenix or something like that
[1:21:50] might even become a seaport
[1:21:52] um but you have that much demonstration
[1:21:54] you have the volcanics all of a sudden
[1:21:55] begin to erupt and you have all this
[1:21:57] other stuff going and all of and you
[1:21:59] know it talks about having the mark of
[1:22:01] the beast
[1:22:02] he says if you want to buy if you want
[1:22:03] to sell if you want to go to the grocery
[1:22:05] store you have to have the mark you have
[1:22:06] to have this you have to have that on
[1:22:08] all of us and
[1:22:09] unless you're going to take the mark of
[1:22:10] the beast um
[1:22:13] but what happens when you have nothing
[1:22:15] can you come to your relationship with
[1:22:18] god
[1:22:19] to where if everything else is gone
[1:22:22] that will not change your relationship
[1:22:24] and your in your willingness to praise
[1:22:27] god
[1:22:28] you know i look at this pandemic and all
[1:22:30] the stuff that goes and and
[1:22:34] it disturbs me that people have come to
[1:22:36] the place they no longer want to gather
[1:22:38] for worship
[1:22:40] they just as soon sit at home in their
[1:22:42] pajamas with their coffee and donuts and
[1:22:44] sit there and sit there and and scam
[1:22:46] okay
[1:22:47] and if that is as far as your
[1:22:49] relationship with god has come
[1:22:52] in my opinion you're in deep trouble
[1:22:55] because if you brother branham says if
[1:22:57] you love jesus christ
[1:22:59] you cannot wait for those church doors
[1:23:02] to open
[1:23:07] one of the things that i've noticed with
[1:23:09] it that this pandemic has done and it
[1:23:11] has it has hindered our fellowship with
[1:23:13] each other
[1:23:14] and it's the fellowship that we have
[1:23:16] with each other that encourages us each
[1:23:20] each other
[1:23:21] we could not wait when finally we could
[1:23:23] get together as a church i mean even if
[1:23:25] we're only allowed ten and i was well
[1:23:27] okay this one's not there that means i
[1:23:29] can go okay i can go and and i told my
[1:23:32] pastor i got a bad attitude
[1:23:35] i says i want to go to church and i
[1:23:37] couldn't
[1:23:38] and so i was having terrible
[1:23:41] terrible attitude
[1:23:44] because i wanted fellowship
[1:23:47] i wanted to gather together with
[1:23:48] somebody else where i could join with
[1:23:51] them in worship and praise to god
[1:23:55] we can go to walmart we can go to lowe's
[1:23:57] we can go to we can go to all these
[1:23:59] other places grocery store
[1:24:01] i mean it's like in india oh yeah they
[1:24:03] were shutting it down but then then they
[1:24:05] would take a
[1:24:06] transit car that was only supposed to
[1:24:08] hold maybe 30 or 40 people and they
[1:24:10] would cram a hundred people in there so
[1:24:13] they could get to work
[1:24:15] but yet they wouldn't go to church
[1:24:20] i'm sorry this doesn't compute
[1:24:22] but it has to come to the place what is
[1:24:24] your relationship with jesus christ
[1:24:27] have you come to have you come to the
[1:24:29] place in your in your life and your
[1:24:31] relationship with god that you literally
[1:24:33] trust him for everything
[1:24:36] i trust him for my health
[1:24:38] i trust him to supply my needs i trust
[1:24:41] him to supply the food that we have i
[1:24:43] trust him literally for everything
[1:24:45] and because i put my trust in him he
[1:24:47] honors that and he sees the cc
[1:24:50] we just traveled to india i mean to
[1:24:52] arizona and i went to one place and i
[1:24:56] ministered a church in phoenix and come
[1:24:58] to find out the next day when we were
[1:25:00] traveling to another city come to find
[1:25:02] out that my translator had come down
[1:25:04] with covid so we were exposed and then
[1:25:07] we went to another church and come to
[1:25:08] find out that after we left there that
[1:25:10] people there had come down with covid
[1:25:13] and we were exposed then we went
[1:25:14] someplace else and came to find out they
[1:25:16] also came down with covet and we were
[1:25:18] exposed
[1:25:19] so for a month we traveled up and down
[1:25:21] arizona put two thousand miles on the
[1:25:23] car we rented and we never got sick on
[1:25:26] anything
[1:25:27] okay
[1:25:27] but here again it's i put my trust in
[1:25:30] him
[1:25:31] what happens if i get covert tomorrow
[1:25:32] well then god has a reason for it
[1:25:35] i have to look at it that way
[1:25:38] but i'm also trusting him for my health
[1:25:40] i'm trusting him to supply
[1:25:43] you know brother battery says you don't
[1:25:45] know the faith that you've got it's an
[1:25:46] unconscious matter with you
[1:25:48] he says could you imagine jesus
[1:25:50] questioning whether he had the faith or
[1:25:51] not to to stop the wind or to steal the
[1:25:53] waves or faith enough to raise lazarus
[1:25:56] he says brother branham and he swore by
[1:25:58] himself he makes this statement he says
[1:26:00] listen i'm going to say something
[1:26:02] look faith is unconscious
[1:26:04] he says do you believe it he says i've
[1:26:06] learned in the years of travel around
[1:26:08] the world and meeting the people of all
[1:26:10] different walks but faith is unconscious
[1:26:13] you've got faith and you don't even know
[1:26:14] it
[1:26:15] that's right he said jesus christ no
[1:26:17] matter if he was in a storm and the gale
[1:26:19] was knocking the boat from one side to
[1:26:20] the other or he was standing in the face
[1:26:23] of a mess of demons
[1:26:24] if he was hanging anywhere it just never
[1:26:26] moved him
[1:26:27] he walked right along just as calm and
[1:26:29] quiet as he could be why he was simply
[1:26:32] unconscious of fear of anything around
[1:26:34] him
[1:26:35] he said that's right whether it's going
[1:26:37] to happen or whether it wasn't going to
[1:26:38] happen he knew it was going to happen
[1:26:40] because god had said so he didn't say oh
[1:26:42] i wonder if i prayed through i wonder if
[1:26:44] i fasted long enough i wonder if i did
[1:26:46] this he said no he just walked right
[1:26:48] along unconscious that's right he
[1:26:49] believed what god he believed what god
[1:26:52] said was true and the words and and the
[1:26:54] words must be fulfilled
[1:26:57] we living in the time when the when we
[1:26:59] are in the bright age
[1:27:01] the world is in ladies we're in the
[1:27:03] bright age
[1:27:04] and there's there are there's a word
[1:27:06] that the bride itself has to fulfill
[1:27:09] revelations 10 7 the days of the voice
[1:27:11] of the seventh angel when he shall begin
[1:27:13] to sound the mystery of god is going to
[1:27:14] be finished
[1:27:16] we are that mystery
[1:27:18] [Music]
[1:27:20] we are that mystery
[1:27:22] what what is the mystery that paul said
[1:27:23] he says the mystery is christ living in
[1:27:25] you where god was coming and where god
[1:27:28] would come
[1:27:31] [Applause]
[1:27:35] where god would come and he would
[1:27:37] sanctify a people where he himself could
[1:27:40] so come and live in them until it was no
[1:27:42] longer them living but christ living his
[1:27:44] life through them but see that's where
[1:27:47] we have to come
[1:27:48] but in order for that to happen we have
[1:27:51] to have faith in god
[1:27:53] we have to come to having a relationship
[1:27:56] with god himself that we literally trust
[1:27:59] him for everything
[1:28:01] i know when we landed in arizona i had i
[1:28:04] had a scheduled mello made out and we
[1:28:06] had to change that schedule seven times
[1:28:07] in a month
[1:28:10] we the day before we landed the place we
[1:28:12] were going to stay was no longer
[1:28:13] available so we had to stay someplace
[1:28:14] else but god orchestrated that because
[1:28:16] he had a reason for that then we were
[1:28:18] going to go do something else and all of
[1:28:19] a sudden something else came up as well
[1:28:21] that takes care of that plan so let's go
[1:28:23] ahead and go up here so we went up there
[1:28:25] and then god had orchestrated that and
[1:28:26] then we wanted to go someplace else and
[1:28:28] that wouldn't work out so okay well
[1:28:30] let's change our plans and let's do this
[1:28:31] and so god had orchestrated that and so
[1:28:33] we kept changing and changing but i i
[1:28:35] had come to the place
[1:28:38] and i still try and be in that place
[1:28:41] where it doesn't matter what tomorrow
[1:28:42] brings
[1:28:44] it says that whatever it brings okay i
[1:28:46] will adjust to that
[1:28:47] because god has a reason for that
[1:28:50] and i've had to learn to become
[1:28:52] comfortable with all of a sudden my my
[1:28:54] plans being changed at a moment's notice
[1:28:58] but see jesus christ he walked around he
[1:28:59] didn't matter he said because he knew
[1:29:01] that the word that he was to fulfill had
[1:29:03] to be fulfilled but see there's a word
[1:29:05] that we are to fulfill
[1:29:08] we are to be the final voice to the
[1:29:10] final age
[1:29:11] we are to be the final manifestation to
[1:29:13] go into this world until god takes us
[1:29:15] home because you are the only jesus
[1:29:18] christ this world is going to sing and
[1:29:20] so they have to see the life of god
[1:29:22] living itself out through you
[1:29:25] it's not you you know people say well
[1:29:27] i'm trying to live a christian life
[1:29:29] you'll never succeed
[1:29:31] because you're trying
[1:29:33] because you're trying
[1:29:35] no god doesn't want you to try and live
[1:29:37] a christian life
[1:29:38] he wants you to die to yourself
[1:29:41] so that he can live through you
[1:29:43] because see his life is the only one
[1:29:46] that he will accept
[1:29:48] and so if you die out to yourself and
[1:29:50] you let him live his life through you
[1:29:52] then it's no longer you living but now
[1:29:54] it's christ living his life through you
[1:29:56] and that's what god is trying to do what
[1:29:58] happened to brother brown's life in
[1:29:59] ministry
[1:30:01] he managed to he managed to come to a
[1:30:04] place in his own life where he totally
[1:30:06] surrendered to the god that lived in him
[1:30:09] until wherever he went it was no longer
[1:30:11] him living but it was christ living his
[1:30:13] life through him
[1:30:14] he was still a man
[1:30:16] he still had imperfections he still had
[1:30:19] all the problems that men have
[1:30:21] okay i mean i mean when you when you
[1:30:23] listen to it to the things that he said
[1:30:25] but he had come to a place in his life
[1:30:27] that he realized it could no longer be
[1:30:28] him living but now it had to be god
[1:30:30] living through him
[1:30:32] but see that has to come to us now
[1:30:35] you stick it in the prophet and leave it
[1:30:37] there no that's not that that wasn't the
[1:30:39] idea god could take a sinner
[1:30:42] god could take a man with a hot temper
[1:30:44] and god could sit there and sow mold and
[1:30:46] so remake him until he became the very
[1:30:48] image of jesus christ
[1:30:50] and so god could do that in a prophet's
[1:30:52] life why can't he do it in the rest of
[1:30:54] us
[1:30:56] [Applause]
[1:30:58] you know
[1:30:59] you know when we talk about when we talk
[1:31:01] about brother brandon went beyond the
[1:31:02] curtain of time
[1:31:04] because sometimes he said oh yeah he
[1:31:06] said he says oh yeah he's there
[1:31:08] there'll be one in charlotte and
[1:31:09] there'll be one in in in in in detroit
[1:31:11] and there'll be one in in chicago and
[1:31:13] you know one one here one here one here
[1:31:15] and i figure well basically that leaves
[1:31:16] me out
[1:31:18] but then he says beyond the curtain of
[1:31:20] time he says and there were thousands
[1:31:23] well now hey that gives me hope
[1:31:26] because i'm one of those thousands
[1:31:28] i'm one of those thousands which are
[1:31:30] there on the other side and i ran up to
[1:31:32] him and said precious brother because i
[1:31:34] was in that vision
[1:31:37] you know one of the things i've learned
[1:31:39] in in studying the message is you know
[1:31:41] what you see is not really me
[1:31:44] what you do is you see the tabernacle i
[1:31:45] dwell in
[1:31:47] but see the real me is my theophany on
[1:31:49] the other side
[1:31:51] and see that's what that's what brother
[1:31:52] branham saw
[1:31:54] he saw my theophany there
[1:31:56] and it's my theophany calling me to
[1:31:58] become what i am
[1:32:13] so so don't look at yourself
[1:32:16] because what you see is not the real you
[1:32:19] the real you is that the offending which
[1:32:21] was a part of god from the beginning
[1:32:23] and that the often is calling you to a
[1:32:25] higher plane to a higher level where all
[1:32:27] of a sudden you become what god said
[1:32:29] that you are
[1:32:31] the bible says god has predestinated us
[1:32:33] to be conformed to the image of his son
[1:32:36] predestinated means
[1:32:39] my predetermined end is to be totally in
[1:32:42] in the very image of jesus christ
[1:32:45] which means i will have the same
[1:32:46] character that he had
[1:32:48] he wasn't talking about power
[1:32:50] he was talking about character
[1:32:53] the same love the same joy the same
[1:32:55] peace the same long suffering the same
[1:32:57] gentleness
[1:33:04] because see it's it's in the character
[1:33:08] that christ is glorified
[1:33:10] it's in the character that the world is
[1:33:12] looking for
[1:33:14] they see all this other garbage out
[1:33:15] there
[1:33:16] but they're looking for something that's
[1:33:18] real
[1:33:19] and the only real one is jesus christ
[1:33:23] and if you can if you can surrender your
[1:33:25] life to god
[1:33:26] and let him live his life through you
[1:33:29] then they will find the reality that
[1:33:31] they're looking for
[1:33:32] okay
[1:33:34] brother branham and the god who is rich
[1:33:36] in mercy
[1:33:37] he said he says i'm only saying this to
[1:33:39] straighten it out that you might get
[1:33:41] away from this fear and the scare
[1:33:43] you don't know who you are
[1:33:46] you're not going to be
[1:33:48] but now you are the sons of god
[1:33:51] see you always were the sons of god for
[1:33:53] when god had you in his thinking in the
[1:33:55] beginning you have to be some part of
[1:33:56] your house has to be a part of him
[1:33:58] but he says he says the problem is he
[1:34:01] says we have this fear and there's
[1:34:02] scared and and say when i looked at when
[1:34:05] i watched when i studied brother
[1:34:07] branham's life
[1:34:08] when brother branham was born he was
[1:34:10] born to be the prophet to this age
[1:34:12] no question
[1:34:14] but there was training that he had to go
[1:34:16] through
[1:34:17] first he had to accept christ as his
[1:34:18] savior
[1:34:19] and until that had happened there was
[1:34:21] there was nothing god could do with him
[1:34:23] but he once accepted christ and he then
[1:34:26] he became a baptist preacher
[1:34:28] and he went down to the river he's
[1:34:29] baptizing some people he had differences
[1:34:31] with his pastor
[1:34:33] and uh so he went down he started his
[1:34:35] own church he rented a
[1:34:37] sonic lodge or something like that and
[1:34:38] he was down at the end of the street and
[1:34:40] he was baptizing and all of a sudden
[1:34:42] this light came down and spoke and says
[1:34:44] as john the baptist four around the
[1:34:46] first coming christ you have a message
[1:34:48] that will forerun a second
[1:34:49] and brother braham says you know
[1:34:51] i was just standing there when god came
[1:34:54] he says it's not about me it's about the
[1:34:57] god that came
[1:34:59] and so then he then when they when they
[1:35:01] they made this the branham tabernacle he
[1:35:03] put a little thing in there and god
[1:35:05] spoke to him do the work of an
[1:35:06] evangelist
[1:35:07] so that's what he started doing
[1:35:09] he was as a baptist and he was studying
[1:35:11] his word he was preaching on a regular
[1:35:13] basis and stuff like that but god was
[1:35:15] keeping to give him visions
[1:35:18] and he said these visions he says
[1:35:19] everybody tells me this is of the devil
[1:35:21] so i don't want to be having anything of
[1:35:22] the devil but he knows that every vision
[1:35:24] always came to pass
[1:35:26] so he came to the place where he began
[1:35:28] to trust in those visions
[1:35:32] and then he would go along a little
[1:35:33] later on in his life
[1:35:35] and he was reading and and he was
[1:35:37] studying and he looked at how god dealt
[1:35:39] with prophets
[1:35:41] he says well the same way that god spoke
[1:35:42] to them is the same way god's speaking
[1:35:44] to me
[1:35:46] therefore i must be a prophet
[1:35:49] and then he acknowledged that
[1:35:51] and for lack of a better way of
[1:35:53] expressing it he walked into that
[1:35:56] and then he and then when discernment
[1:35:58] came
[1:35:59] he said oh he says there's a scriptural
[1:36:01] reference to this that's abraham abraham
[1:36:03] and sarah and then he would say oh yeah
[1:36:06] so this is see this is it me but he says
[1:36:08] this is the god in me and he would turn
[1:36:10] his back to the audience and say say i
[1:36:12] want to show you christ is here
[1:36:15] he says it's not about me he said he
[1:36:17] says jesus christ is here he's just
[1:36:18] using my body
[1:36:20] and he stepped into that office
[1:36:23] but he always in in his tapes he always
[1:36:26] he always mentioned that he believed
[1:36:27] that billy graham was to be the
[1:36:29] messenger to this age
[1:36:31] but then when kennedy got elected he
[1:36:33] went back to his visions books and he
[1:36:34] says
[1:36:36] the women's vote got this guy into
[1:36:38] office and man look at my all these
[1:36:40] visions they've almost all been
[1:36:41] fulfilled so then he preached the church
[1:36:43] ages
[1:36:45] and that's when the angel at the end of
[1:36:47] that he says now you read malachi 4.
[1:36:51] and he came to the revelation i have to
[1:36:54] be that messenger
[1:36:57] but he also made mention of the fact he
[1:36:59] says when the seventh angel begins to
[1:37:01] sound he says that seven the angel did
[1:37:02] not begin to sound until the opening of
[1:37:04] the seals
[1:37:06] he said and from that point on he says a
[1:37:08] message has been committed to me that i
[1:37:10] must be obedient to from that point on
[1:37:14] he was no longer it was no longer him
[1:37:16] saying what he wanted to say no it was
[1:37:17] god no speaking through him
[1:37:22] but now apply that to us
[1:37:25] when you were born you were sons and
[1:37:27] daughters of god
[1:37:29] you always were sons and daughters of
[1:37:30] god
[1:37:31] okay
[1:37:32] if you're if you have salvation you had
[1:37:35] to be a part of god from the beginning
[1:37:37] okay
[1:37:38] but he says we have this fear and this
[1:37:39] scare we're not willing to step into
[1:37:41] what we are
[1:37:43] we are now willing to claim i am the
[1:37:45] bride of jesus christ i am a member of
[1:37:48] the body of jesus christ and and god is
[1:37:50] trying to live his life and manifest
[1:37:52] himself through me and there are certain
[1:37:54] scriptures that the bride itself must
[1:37:56] fulfill
[1:37:57] because the angel told john he says go
[1:37:59] ahead and take the book because you have
[1:38:01] to eat that book until you literally you
[1:38:03] and the word becomes one
[1:38:05] and when you and the word become one he
[1:38:07] says because you must you the bride must
[1:38:09] prophesy before many nations tongues and
[1:38:11] kings and people
[1:38:13] but that's what we have to be doing
[1:38:17] this is the ministry that we have to
[1:38:19] fulfill
[1:38:21] so we have to be willing to acknowledge
[1:38:23] who we are
[1:38:24] we have to be willing to acknowledge
[1:38:26] that i am a son and daughter not looking
[1:38:28] at myself not looking at my faults and
[1:38:31] my shortcomings and all the things that
[1:38:32] go with being huma being humanity
[1:38:35] but i have to look beyond that and says
[1:38:36] god you have said that i am
[1:38:39] you have told me i am the very
[1:38:41] righteousness of you because i am in you
[1:38:44] and now lord you have a ministry you
[1:38:46] have something you're wanting me to
[1:38:47] fulfill you want me to witness to the
[1:38:49] world that you are alive you want me to
[1:38:51] witness to the world that you heal you
[1:38:53] want me to witness to the world that
[1:38:54] that you that you are still god and you
[1:38:57] are still the god of miracles
[1:39:03] so wherever you go in the things that
[1:39:04] you do
[1:39:06] your life is supposed to be a testimony
[1:39:08] of jesus christ
[1:39:10] i know we we joined a senior choir
[1:39:13] i guess that's what i call it um there's
[1:39:16] a bunch of us old folks that get
[1:39:17] together at church and we sing songs
[1:39:20] and there's
[1:39:21] uh at at any point in time there's 26
[1:39:24] differently not different churches
[1:39:25] represented and some of them are are
[1:39:28] seven day adventists and some of them
[1:39:29] are jehovah witness and some of them are
[1:39:31] baptist some of them are pentecostal and
[1:39:33] some of them are i don't know what
[1:39:35] but they all we all have one thing in
[1:39:37] common
[1:39:38] we love jesus christ
[1:39:43] that's why we get together and sing
[1:39:44] there's we don't discuss doctrines
[1:39:47] no we we get together and one heart and
[1:39:49] one mind and one accord we sing songs to
[1:39:52] praise the god that we love
[1:39:55] and there was a
[1:39:57] month ago i guess it's been it turned
[1:40:00] around people began to testify
[1:40:03] there was one lady there that had
[1:40:04] mentioned the fact that she had no money
[1:40:06] she was she had hardly any gas in her
[1:40:08] car and she had to get around and do
[1:40:10] different things so she takes a bottle
[1:40:12] of oil and she put it on her car
[1:40:14] and she says lord i'm anointing my car i
[1:40:16] need for it to run for the next whatever
[1:40:18] this period was
[1:40:19] without me putting any gas in it
[1:40:22] i don't know how many miles she drove on
[1:40:24] an empty tank but she drove along quite
[1:40:26] a bit
[1:40:28] she was she could testify
[1:40:31] she could testify
[1:40:33] that god honored her request and allowed
[1:40:36] her to drive on an empty tank for
[1:40:38] probably a week or two
[1:40:41] that's the faith she had
[1:40:44] in god you know brother branham makes
[1:40:46] mention of the fact that he was flying
[1:40:47] home
[1:40:49] and as they were flying over memphis
[1:40:50] tennessee um
[1:40:52] all of a sudden either there was a storm
[1:40:54] or whatever the problem was and his
[1:40:56] flight was grounded
[1:40:58] and uh so okay they put him up in a nice
[1:41:01] hotel and in the morning they were going
[1:41:02] to pick him up and fly him home
[1:41:05] and so he's out there he's going to mail
[1:41:06] a letter or do something and all of a
[1:41:08] sudden
[1:41:09] god told him keep walking
[1:41:11] and brother branham began to question it
[1:41:13] but he says they're going to he says no
[1:41:16] walk
[1:41:16] but but he says no don't question just
[1:41:19] do it
[1:41:20] walk yes
[1:41:22] so he walked and he walked and walked
[1:41:24] and came into the poor section of town
[1:41:27] and there there was there was this lady
[1:41:29] there
[1:41:30] and
[1:41:31] as she walked by and she looked
[1:41:33] um she addressed him and said morning
[1:41:35] parson
[1:41:37] and so brother ram stops and says says
[1:41:39] auntie he says how'd you know i was a
[1:41:41] parson he says well i fell asleep last
[1:41:43] night and god showed me you were coming
[1:41:47] god spoke to her
[1:41:48] and showed her exactly the way he was
[1:41:51] going to be dressed
[1:41:53] she says i'm that pseudomite woman and i
[1:41:56] prayed for god send me the
[1:41:58] elijah she had a relationship with god
[1:42:03] that allowed for her prayer to bring
[1:42:05] that plane down
[1:42:06] so that god could prophet could go and
[1:42:08] minister to her
[1:42:10] she didn't know how to rebel she he
[1:42:12] asked i'm my brother brandon have you
[1:42:14] heard of me
[1:42:15] nope never heard of you before
[1:42:17] oh do you understand the seven seals
[1:42:19] right you've got a revelation of the
[1:42:21] seventh seal
[1:42:22] do you understand the tent vision right
[1:42:24] you've got you finally got a revelation
[1:42:26] of the ten division right
[1:42:30] no she knew jesus christ
[1:42:36] she had a relationship with jesus christ
[1:42:39] that allowed her prayer to reach god for
[1:42:42] god to bring that plane down so brother
[1:42:44] branham could go and minister to her
[1:42:47] and the question i always have is do we
[1:42:49] have the same level of trust
[1:42:53] have we come to a place in our
[1:42:54] relationship with jesus christ
[1:42:57] that we believe in that we believe that
[1:42:59] the promises god has given to us god
[1:43:02] will act upon all of them for our good
[1:43:05] lord
[1:43:07] and that's a challenge
[1:43:10] and one last thing
[1:43:11] my wife and i we were flying to india i
[1:43:14] guess it was
[1:43:15] 2021 i guess
[1:43:17] now 2020.
[1:43:18] okay anyway
[1:43:20] time flies when you're having fun
[1:43:23] anyway i was sitting in a church uh
[1:43:26] about a week or a month before i forget
[1:43:27] what it was and i was just opening my
[1:43:29] bible and trying to be quiet and prepare
[1:43:31] myself for the service
[1:43:32] and i opened up to isaiah the 31 and
[1:43:35] verses one to three
[1:43:36] and i'll just read part of it it says in
[1:43:39] 31 and one it says woe to them that go
[1:43:40] down to egypt for help and stay on
[1:43:42] horses and trust in chariots because
[1:43:44] they're many and in horsemen because
[1:43:46] they're very strong but they look not to
[1:43:47] the holy one of israel neither seek the
[1:43:49] lord
[1:43:50] and verse three it says now the
[1:43:52] egyptians are men and not god and their
[1:43:55] horses are flesh
[1:43:56] and not spirit
[1:43:59] and so that it came down here he god at
[1:44:01] this point in in in the life of israel
[1:44:04] and
[1:44:06] anyway the king which was there
[1:44:08] um
[1:44:10] he had been over he had been surrounded
[1:44:11] by by the king of babylon
[1:44:14] and uh he didn't have enough manpower to
[1:44:16] be able to defend the city so he was
[1:44:18] going to go
[1:44:19] go to egypt and go down and give them
[1:44:20] some money and hey come give us a hand
[1:44:22] and so isaiah went to that went to the
[1:44:24] minister hezekiah was that was it was
[1:44:26] the the
[1:44:28] king at that time
[1:44:30] and
[1:44:30] and isaiah said
[1:44:32] don't go to egypt trust god
[1:44:37] for i for hezekiah to put total reliance
[1:44:40] upon god for deliverance
[1:44:42] was asking a lot
[1:44:44] because his whole city his whole nation
[1:44:47] was at stake
[1:44:49] but he did
[1:44:50] and then god delivered
[1:44:52] so anyway so my wife and i we were
[1:44:54] flying we landed we took off from one of
[1:44:56] the cities landed in in
[1:44:59] london
[1:45:00] and uh made our connecting flight so
[1:45:02] we're looking at a good
[1:45:04] eight to ten hour flight from london
[1:45:06] into hyderabad
[1:45:08] and uh the food isn't what it used to be
[1:45:10] but food's still food
[1:45:12] and so they serve it normally speaking
[1:45:14] about an hour and a half after they take
[1:45:15] off because they all want to go to sleep
[1:45:18] because it's a night flight
[1:45:19] and i noticed well i was hungry always
[1:45:23] and so i was eating and my wife
[1:45:25] she wasn't eating anything she wasn't
[1:45:27] even touching it i said well honey
[1:45:28] what's wrong with that
[1:45:30] she says well i still got this severe
[1:45:31] headache when we when we landed in
[1:45:33] london i guess the fumes and all the
[1:45:35] stuff that was there it just says i just
[1:45:36] got this really bad headache and i just
[1:45:38] can't eat
[1:45:39] and so i said well okay in another four
[1:45:41] or six hours we'll land in hyderabad we
[1:45:44] got some pills there
[1:45:45] in our luggage you know in the belly of
[1:45:47] the plane
[1:45:49] i said then you'll go to bed and get
[1:45:50] some sleep and you know and you'll be
[1:45:51] fine within a day or so because she has
[1:45:53] these periodically
[1:45:55] or did have
[1:45:57] and
[1:45:58] then knockout said god
[1:46:00] reminded me what i read in isaiah
[1:46:03] woe to them that go down to egypt for
[1:46:06] help
[1:46:08] why do you always rely on yourself
[1:46:12] why do you always rely upon your own
[1:46:14] abilities
[1:46:16] why is it you think you can take care of
[1:46:18] it yourself
[1:46:20] he said the egyptians are men
[1:46:23] they're not god
[1:46:24] and the horses are flesh
[1:46:26] they're not spirit
[1:46:28] man is limited
[1:46:31] we can only do so much
[1:46:34] but god is unlimited
[1:46:37] so god says trust me this time okay so i
[1:46:41] prayed for surely i said well we're on a
[1:46:42] trip
[1:46:43] and we've satan is harassing us and i'm
[1:46:46] asking for mercy lord i want you to
[1:46:48] touch my wife and remove this headache
[1:46:50] well within an hour or so the headache
[1:46:52] began to go away and before we landed
[1:46:54] she was fine
[1:46:55] but see god god was trying to teach me
[1:47:00] don't rely on yourself
[1:47:03] and the things that happened on that
[1:47:04] trip to india
[1:47:07] if we had not relied upon god we
[1:47:09] probably wouldn't be here
[1:47:12] but god all through that whole trip he
[1:47:14] says you must trust me
[1:47:17] not trust in this not trusting that no
[1:47:19] you must put your trust in me because i
[1:47:22] am the only one that is going to survive
[1:47:24] i'm the only one that's going to take
[1:47:26] care of you and see you to the end of
[1:47:27] this journey
[1:47:30] so like i say god's been trying to teach
[1:47:32] me this
[1:47:33] and i'm coming to the place i'm i
[1:47:35] haven't graduated yet but i'm
[1:47:37] hoping you know i'm working my way
[1:47:39] through the sophomore year maybe but you
[1:47:41] know it's trying to come to the grasp
[1:47:43] into the into the into the understanding
[1:47:46] that if i ca and this is the way i look
[1:47:47] at habakkuk
[1:47:49] if i take my hand and i put my hand in
[1:47:51] his
[1:47:54] as a child to his father
[1:47:57] and i trust totally in my father for my
[1:48:00] very existence and for memory very
[1:48:02] sustenance and for everything that i
[1:48:04] have and everything that i'm needing
[1:48:06] that he says he will take care of me
[1:48:09] and that's the relate that that is what
[1:48:11] i got out of when i did in my study in
[1:48:13] havaka
[1:48:14] and so that's basically what i try to
[1:48:16] practice i says okay lord we've got
[1:48:18] problems coming up now lord
[1:48:20] i don't know how you're going to provide
[1:48:21] or supply but

[1:48:28] it's like with healing well lord you
[1:48:29] told me i'm healed
[1:48:31] okay well obviously i am now i'm just
[1:48:33] waiting for its manifestation
[1:48:36] because you have to honor your word
[1:48:38] you cannot lie
[1:48:40] and so if you're going to honor your
[1:48:41] word and you told me i'm healed
[1:48:42] obviously i am now i'm just waiting for
[1:48:44] it to come into manifestation
[1:48:46] and see this this is what god has been
[1:48:48] dealing with me in my life and like i
[1:48:50] say this study in havoc it changed my
[1:48:52] whole concept of faith
[1:48:54] it's not trying to believe for something
[1:48:57] but it's coming to have it believing in
[1:48:59] someone to the place where i can put
[1:49:01] total trust and total confidence
[1:49:04] in him

[1:51:30] and he will do everything
[1:51:32] amen
[1:51:34] take second corinthians 3.

[1:51:49] you heard about origin
[1:51:51] you heard it all
[1:51:53] amen
[1:51:56] all this pressure that is coming up god
[1:51:58] wants you to learn to depend on him
[1:52:03] because when everything will collapse
[1:52:06] it's not going to bother you you'll be
[1:52:08] ready for the hour
[1:52:10] amen
[1:52:12] remember sunday leave the humanistic
[1:52:14] level
[1:52:16] get into the realm of faith
[1:52:19] he was not there the holy spirit bring
[1:52:21] it right straight
[1:52:23] to the point again
[1:52:25] in other words god is insisting
[1:52:28] god is telling somebody
[1:52:30] stop
[1:52:31] what you have been doing
[1:52:34] he's insisting that stop
[1:52:37] if not he's going to break you
[1:52:40] if you don't understand i'm not saying
[1:52:42] he's going to kill you
[1:52:44] but he will
[1:52:46] until you realize that you have no power
[1:52:51] you know when somebody get in the river
[1:52:52] what do they do sometime
[1:52:54] if they try to get him he's going to
[1:52:56] kill you
[1:52:57] once you get there he will step on you
[1:52:59] and he will try to breathe
[1:53:01] they usually let him a little bit
[1:53:04] get some water water then when he's
[1:53:06] tired or hope he's gone then the master
[1:53:09] get in and pull him outside
[1:53:12] amen
[1:53:13] if you are you still want to go fight
[1:53:16] thank god no problem we'll continue to
[1:53:18] pray for you
[1:53:20] but you need to stop
[1:53:22] amen
[1:53:23] stop
[1:53:24] if god call you to do something
[1:53:27] invest yourself into it and give him the
[1:53:30] first place
[1:53:31] and you will see what god will do
[1:53:34] hard thing for people to believe
[1:53:37] amen we always try to make sense i have
[1:53:40] to be here i have to do this i have to
[1:53:43] do this yes you have been doing like
[1:53:45] that for 10 years
[1:53:48] what is the result that you get can you
[1:53:50] at least try once
[1:53:52] try the second time and see how it works
[1:53:56] amen
[1:53:57] do you want to try
[1:53:58] you never even try to ask for a change
[1:54:01] of schedule
[1:54:03] because there is no desire to be in
[1:54:05] church
[1:54:08] if you were desiring to be in church
[1:54:10] desiring to be in church if it's burning
[1:54:13] it might push you to at least say can i
[1:54:15] be able to at least on wednesday if i
[1:54:18] can finish early and then i can go to
[1:54:20] church did you try that
[1:54:22] no you just conformed to the humanistic
[1:54:25] level
[1:54:26] in the humanistic level that's the way
[1:54:28] it is it's eight hours i gotta be there
[1:54:30] god i understand he knows my heart
[1:54:31] that's it
[1:54:32] no pushing
[1:54:34] for something
[1:54:36] amen
[1:54:38] you know with the lack of
[1:54:40] employment
[1:54:42] the salary of the people went higher
[1:54:45] because people do not want work
[1:54:48] so the people they hire newly make more
[1:54:51] money than those that have been there
[1:54:53] and those that have been there don't do
[1:54:55] anything they keep working they don't
[1:54:57] understand that the new one that came
[1:54:59] and making more money
[1:55:04] you see what i'm saying
[1:55:05] and you're doing the same thing but
[1:55:07] somebody's getting paid sooner more than
[1:55:10] you and you've been there for years
[1:55:13] why
[1:55:14] got used to something
[1:55:17] and not aware of something amen
[1:55:20] amen
[1:55:21] if god call you something give him the
[1:55:23] first place try the preeminence
[1:55:26] and you will see
[1:55:29] amen
[1:55:30] you can do it in one shot or you can do
[1:55:32] it in five
[1:55:37] i had a patient
[1:55:38] on monday
[1:55:40] and i had a procedure
[1:55:42] to do on monday
[1:55:45] and there was a saint that wanted me to
[1:55:47] pray
[1:55:48] for him
[1:55:49] on friday
[1:55:51] don't get an appointment and everything
[1:55:55] and then i needed some equipment for
[1:55:57] that specific patient
[1:56:00] when i call they say the equipment will
[1:56:02] come on friday
[1:56:04] and i need to pray for somebody on
[1:56:06] friday
[1:56:08] i call the person and say you know what
[1:56:10] can we change the schedule a little bit
[1:56:12] so i can come later
[1:56:14] and the person turn around and say
[1:56:16] pastor you can just speak the word
[1:56:20] amen
[1:56:22] and look i say i appreciate your faith
[1:56:26] i appreciate your faith but
[1:56:30] i told you i'm going to be there
[1:56:33] amen
[1:56:35] i sleep in first and give that the
[1:56:37] preeminence
[1:56:39] and went and pray for that person and
[1:56:42] came back to the office
[1:56:44] and the gps came earlier and they missed
[1:56:47] me
[1:56:48] what would the devil tell me
[1:56:53] you see
[1:56:54] you could have tell that person you can
[1:56:55] come back later
[1:56:57] and then you will get the package first
[1:56:58] and go right
[1:57:00] because on monday you have a procedure
[1:57:02] get broad guess what happened on monday
[1:57:09] the procedure was not done
[1:57:13] if i would have given that patient
[1:57:16] preeminence on sun on one on friday
[1:57:20] who will be condemned
[1:57:22] on monday
[1:57:29] you see what i'm saying
[1:57:30] you see what i'm saying
[1:57:34] the one who knew told me give the
[1:57:36] preeminence here
[1:57:38] he knew that patient is he's not going
[1:57:40] to do it
[1:57:45] i thought somebody if you get down my
[1:57:47] road it's going to be tough because
[1:57:48] you're going to be tightened harder
[1:57:51] and it's the way
[1:57:52] it is it's not easy trusting in the lord
[1:57:56] amen
[1:57:57] it's usually when everything is going
[1:57:59] against you and contrary and it seems
[1:58:01] like nothing is working
[1:58:04] that's the time you give the most
[1:58:06] preeminence to god and when god
[1:58:10] does something one time to you
[1:58:12] it's going to be like abseil in your
[1:58:15] life you will never forget it
[1:58:18] when something happened you will be
[1:58:20] using that spot like
[1:58:22] like an ankle god you did it there
[1:58:28] david used it he said the girl that
[1:58:30] helped me kill the lion do you think
[1:58:32] it's easy to kill a lion have you seen a
[1:58:34] lion before
[1:58:36] have you seen a bear ask brother robert
[1:58:39] we went to a store to get the carpet
[1:58:41] brother mike daley asked him a big bear
[1:58:43] it's even high like double my size
[1:58:48] i was like wait a minute this thing is
[1:58:49] huge
[1:58:51] and david kill it
[1:58:53] if you if he can kill that thing what
[1:58:55] was goliath
[1:58:59] you see what i'm saying so sometimes god
[1:59:02] bring things in life and go with you
[1:59:04] higher like let's go let's go let's see
[1:59:06] how higher you can go and before you
[1:59:08] know it we drop he said he's still in
[1:59:10] level two let's try again
[1:59:13] trust him one time
[1:59:16] and see what god will do
[1:59:18] give him a preemie and when you do that
[1:59:20] the devil would automatically challenge
[1:59:22] you to show you that if because you did
[1:59:25] it look what is happening
[1:59:26] if you hold tight
[1:59:28] you're gonna learn one thing in your
[1:59:30] life it's gonna help you through your
[1:59:32] marriage through your trouble through
[1:59:34] everything you'll begin to use the same
[1:59:36] weapon and keep using it when it
[1:59:38] happened you use the same gun and keep
[1:59:40] moving just one experience all it takes
[1:59:43] is just one
[1:59:45] amen
[1:59:46] but we
[1:59:48] so caught up into this
[1:59:50] we want to justify everything we're
[1:59:52] doing
[1:59:53] no the lord understand i have to do this
[1:59:56] so i'm not going to do this the lord
[1:59:57] understand i'm going to do this but i'm
[1:59:59] going to go this the lord understands
[2:00:01] if everybody dies like that who's going
[2:00:03] to be even in church here
[2:00:06] everybody will be at home we got stuff
[2:00:07] to do
[2:00:08] we got a streaming i will stay home the
[2:00:10] lord understand i'm going through this i
[2:00:12] can stream i didn't miss the service i'm
[2:00:14] up today the pastor asked every day i'm
[2:00:16] still up today but i'm now coming to
[2:00:18] church
[2:00:21] you see what is going on
[2:00:23] that uh that presence here is different
[2:00:26] than in your home
[2:00:29] i gave you a quote here when we started
[2:00:31] this church brother branham say angel
[2:00:32] stays in the church
[2:00:34] you remember that's why the atmosphere
[2:00:36] in the church is different how can the
[2:00:38] holy ghost tell you when the day
[2:00:39] approaching do not forsake the assembly
[2:00:42] so the holy ghost already seen that it's
[2:00:44] going to be a spirit of people that's
[2:00:46] going to forsake the assembly as the day
[2:00:49] approaching
[2:00:51] so somebody's fulfilling a prophecy but
[2:00:54] i'm going to fulfill mine
[2:00:55] i'm going to be on the one that's not
[2:00:57] going to forsake the assembly of the
[2:00:59] church
[2:01:05] second corinthians chapter 3.
[2:01:09] church please take your hand off your
[2:01:11] life
[2:01:12] the brother speak clearly do not look at
[2:01:16] yourself
[2:01:17] do not look at yourself the day the holy
[2:01:21] ghost will give me signal to go through
[2:01:23] justification
[2:01:24] sanctification and the baptism of the
[2:01:26] holy ghost you will see
[2:01:28] how many errors you did
[2:01:34] on looking at yourself
[2:01:37] amen do you think when god called you he
[2:01:40] didn't know who you are
[2:01:43] he didn't know your failure
[2:01:46] when they say oh david a man after my
[2:01:48] own heart we think like david was
[2:01:50] perfect
[2:01:54] how did they grab paul
[2:01:56] going to kill people
[2:02:00] how can you get somebody who has been
[2:02:03] causing havoc
[2:02:04] holding christians putting them in jail
[2:02:07] going even in the road to kill somebody
[2:02:09] in that very moment of anger the the
[2:02:12] scriptures say he was angry raging for
[2:02:16] the christian what kind of prayer did
[2:02:18] paul do to bring god to his sin
[2:02:24] he was operating in a humanistic level
[2:02:28] religiously humanistic
[2:02:32] what prayer did paul do
[2:02:34] who prayed for him
[2:02:36] who prayed for paul
[2:02:40] so what happened
[2:02:43] in act nine god told paul you were a
[2:02:47] chosen
[2:02:48] vessel
[2:02:50] that's all
[2:02:52] that's all the matter
[2:02:54] a chosen vessel right in the middle of
[2:02:56] raging battle he turned him up and
[2:02:59] turned him 360
[2:03:01] opposite direction
[2:03:03] and he become even the most deadly
[2:03:05] weapon ever if he get there the jews are
[2:03:08] in trouble if he get in a synagogue the
[2:03:10] jews are imprisoned the very man that
[2:03:12] was sitting under the command of the
[2:03:14] high priest
[2:03:16] what else can paul trust
[2:03:18] that's why paul when he went higher he
[2:03:20] say everything that i ever learned
[2:03:24] humanistic down now i am
[2:03:27] in a different level
[2:03:30] amen
[2:03:31] second corinthians 3 verse 2
[2:03:35] ye are our pistol
[2:03:38] written in our hearts
[2:03:40] known and read off
[2:03:43] that's what the brother told you
[2:03:45] for as much as he are manifestly
[2:03:48] declared
[2:03:49] to be the epistle of christ
[2:03:52] ministered by us now he explained it
[2:03:54] plainly written not with ink
[2:03:58] but with the
[2:04:00] so the spirit can write
[2:04:03] what is the pain the spirit used
[2:04:10] somebody called it you know the pain the
[2:04:12] spirit is
[2:04:14] you will see it on sunday amen
[2:04:17] written not with ink
[2:04:19] but
[2:04:21] paul say we are written in peace right
[2:04:25] right
[2:04:28] so how was paul writing
[2:04:33] what was paul using to write in the
[2:04:35] people's tongue
[2:04:37] so paul was coming and do a surgery and
[2:04:40] right
[2:04:44] amen
[2:04:45] written not with ink but with the spirit
[2:04:48] of the living god
[2:04:50] not in tables of stone
[2:04:54] but in fleshly tables of though
[2:04:58] and such trust have we through christ
[2:05:02] to god's word
[2:05:05] amen
[2:05:06] not that we are sufficient
[2:05:10] of ourselves
[2:05:12] to think anything
[2:05:14] as of ourselves
[2:05:16] but our sufficiency
[2:05:18] is off
[2:05:22] anybody clear
[2:05:23] learn to depend
[2:05:26] on god for every
[2:05:29] thing
[2:05:31] even if you lost your pain
[2:05:34] learn to pray lord help me find a pain
[2:05:39] don't say the pain is easy i can do it
[2:05:42] god can complicate it and you won't find
[2:05:44] it
[2:05:45] amen
[2:05:46] it's easy because god allows you to find
[2:05:49] it
[2:05:49] learn
[2:05:50] to depend on god in everything that you
[2:05:53] do remember your relationship put trust
[2:05:57] on the one that you gave your heart to
[2:06:00] and remember his word would never fail
[2:06:03] heaven and earth will pass away but his
[2:06:06] word will never
[2:06:08] never never fail
[2:06:10] if you have that confidence on god's
[2:06:12] word then you will understand why peter
[2:06:15] say that word
[2:06:18] amen because somebody learned through
[2:06:20] experience that when he say something it
[2:06:23] happened when he say something it
[2:06:25] happened when he say something it
[2:06:27] happened at that word that it if he says
[2:06:30] it i'm not questioning it anymore i'm
[2:06:32] not going to question it i will go
[2:06:33] straight ahead and do what he say and if
[2:06:36] you apply the bible like that
[2:06:39] you will see what he's going to do
[2:06:40] that's that's that's what brother
[2:06:42] branham was trying all along to bring
[2:06:44] the people to bring the people to a
[2:06:46] perfect confidence in the bible where
[2:06:50] somebody look at the promise and just
[2:06:52] pick it up from there and that's it and
[2:06:54] he can bring anything that he wanted
[2:06:56] just using the scripture because this is
[2:06:58] god's eternal word this is god who spoke
[2:07:01] god cannot even god cannot take back
[2:07:03] what he spoke
[2:07:05] the bible say when it's revealed it
