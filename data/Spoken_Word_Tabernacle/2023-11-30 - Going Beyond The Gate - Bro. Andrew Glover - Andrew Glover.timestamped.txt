[0:02] stage of restoration amen the first one
[0:05] was justification amen and the second
[0:08] one was sanctification listen amen it's
[0:10] a good place to go is sanctification
[0:12] we've everyone got to go there amen but
[0:15] you cannot stay there because there's
[0:17] more to the journey than just
[0:19] justification or sanctification but
[0:22] there's a baptism of a holy ghost but
[0:24] let me go and say it you can't even stay
[0:27] there amen there's more to the believer
[0:30] there's a there there is the word
[0:32] itself come on lot was the time for the
[0:34] Lorn believer but Abraham wasn't because
[0:38] he was air Amen to lot was Lot was air
[0:41] to a lukor condition that Abraham was
[0:44] air to everything that God had given him
[0:47] in the Covenant let me just say it to
[0:49] you tonight Church there's a bride on
[0:51] the earth tonight and denomination has
[0:53] gone as far as they can go they have
[0:56] settled down with tradition they have
[0:58] settled down with dogness and settle
[1:00] down but just having church services
[1:02] amen but there's a bride on the earth
[1:04] tonight who is a Seed of Abraham and
[1:07] she's not anointed just to go to the
[1:09] gates she is Anointed to go to the door
[1:12] and to go through the door because she's
[1:14] an air to all F theet of God establishes
[1:18] what lot was he was a type of a luk
[1:21] forign Believer again 1959 he said as it
[1:24] was in the days of lot so shall it be in
[1:26] the coming of the son of man he said now
[1:28] does your spirit deser this right
[1:30] remember lot was a type of America now
[1:34] lot is a type of the Lorn believer he's
[1:36] also a type of America so a Lorn
[1:39] believer can only go so far and America
[1:42] can only go so far he said it's proven
[1:44] it what was the sin of Sodom it was
[1:46] perversion in this American country of
[1:48] ours the women has degraded themselves
[1:51] so much until natural men sources has
[1:53] been perverted and so now we have a lot
[1:56] as a type of the lukor believer right
[1:58] yes sir we have as a type of America
[2:01] 1964 the prophet of God says he been
[2:04] down there in Sodom we've seen what
[2:06] taking place he said now there was Lot a
[2:08] type of the church natural am been down
[2:11] in Sodom the organization so now we have
[2:14] him as the Lorn believer as a type of
[2:16] America and now as a type of the
[2:19] organization amen he said but they got a
[2:21] messenger down there he said that was a
[2:23] Billy Graham and or Roberts now don't
[2:26] forget this that Billy Graham could only
[2:28] take his people so calm
[2:30] Billy Billy Graham did a good job at
[2:32] preaching repentance he preached the
[2:34] salvation but he can only take him so
[2:36] far and then there was an Oral Roberts
[2:39] that would move him from Billy Graham's
[2:40] time am into the Pentecostal seed but
[2:44] there was more to it than just the
[2:45] Pentecostal seed and then but there was
[2:47] a word seed that had to be sold into the
[2:50] heart of the Bride he said see lot one
[2:53] of the world Amen so God tore up his
[2:55] world and separated Abraham and lot he
[2:58] said and lot being type again of a
[3:01] carinal Believer amen he's a Lor
[3:04] believer he's a type of America he's a
[3:06] type of the organization he's a type of
[3:08] a carnal believer who didn't think these
[3:11] things were true so he just went on down
[3:13] in the sorrow and then lot did not
[3:16] believe the things that Abraham was
[3:17] talking about so he settled for Sodom
[3:20] amen and he didn't have the real spunk
[3:22] to stand out amen and call what was
[3:25] right right and what was wrong wrong can
[3:27] I sit to you like this God does not want
[3:29] MI
[3:30] amen God wants
[3:33] separators Abraham was a separator amen
[3:36] lot was a mixer that's why lot amen
[3:39] could go into Sodom and could be happy
[3:42] with the conditions of Sodom that it fed
[3:45] Abraham and then because he knew he was
[3:47] more and then he knew he was air to more
[3:50] than what Sodom had let me just tell you
[3:52] Bri I tell you why you cannot get
[3:54] satisfied in way I see tell why this
[3:57] world is not satisfied hunger of your
[4:00] soul it's because we are citizens of
[4:03] another C we are seeking a
[4:05] city foundations the C is the maker of
[4:09] the
[4:10] dev let me said f as I know how we will
[4:13] not back up we will not lay down and we
[4:16] will not be satisfied with temporary
[4:18] conditions when there's a
[4:21] Perfection
[4:24] our there a the L but something Beyond
[4:28] this convention and call to the Bride of
[4:31] Jesus Christ come up
[4:34] high come on up high up of the America
[4:38] come up out of lukew condition come up
[4:40] out of
[4:41] carnality God called Abraham Amen to a
[4:45] total separation because God requires
[4:48] amen a complete separation from the
[4:51] world yes sir God requires a complete
[4:55] separation from the world now can I can
[4:57] I share something with you tonight and
[4:59] then don't forget this okay sometimes
[5:02] advancement requires separation that's
[5:05] right
[5:06] yes
[5:09] sometimes requires
[5:12] separation don't just suggest it no sir
[5:15] it's not a recommendation no sir it's
[5:17] not an option it's a requirement yes sir
[5:21] said no matter what the world says they
[5:23] still want bow to the Modern Trend of
[5:26] modern religion no social gospel for
[5:28] them men some that still believe God's
[5:31] holy they believe he requires Holiness
[5:33] he requires the new birth and he
[5:35] requires a separation from sin that is
[5:38] not a suggestion my friend that is a
[5:41] requirement that's a holy God that
[5:44] requires Holiness he requires a new
[5:46] birth and he requires a separation from
[5:49] sin when you separate can I say this
[5:52] when you separate you are separating
[5:54] from something amen amen to go into
[5:57] something you are separating from
[6:00] something to something so you're not
[6:02] just separating yourself to be Idol and
[6:04] standing alone but you're separating
[6:07] yourself because there's a higher
[6:10] call there a higher calling upon your
[6:12] life and I tell you what for the devil
[6:15] wants to put a pressure on message
[6:17] people say well you all are just trying
[6:19] to be something you're just trying to
[6:21] preach something deep and you're just
[6:23] trying to be some revelated something no
[6:25] you don't understand we're not lck where
[6:28] Abraham a city and our name and we can
[6:33] St here and the only way to get there is
[6:36] by Revelation so we're willing to
[6:38] separate from everything contrary to
[6:41] God's word to walk in the provisions of
[6:45] jeah when you separate you separate from
[6:49] something Amen to something don't ever
[6:52] forget that I'm I'm laying some
[6:54] Foundation advancement requires
[6:57] separation and when you separate
[7:00] you separate from something to something
[7:03] said the first man separated himself he
[7:05] said that was Adam and he separated
[7:08] himself from the word to go with his
[7:10] wife so Adam left the word to follow his
[7:13] wife that question whether God kept his
[7:16] word or not he said what a perfect type
[7:19] of the lukor carnal minded believer
[7:21] today that still wants to clean with
[7:23] that their tradition says instead of
[7:26] taking what the word says and then
[7:28] there's your problem
[7:32] tradition the of the word stand with
[7:36] tradition he said he was separated to
[7:38] his wife he said and the carnal believer
[7:40] is separated amen from the word to the
[7:43] church the caral believer is separated
[7:47] from the word to the church the genuine
[7:50] believer Abraham believer is separated
[7:53] from the church to the
[7:56] word
[7:58] preach for seal I'm no longer going to
[8:01] call you church I'm call you
[8:05] CH no going to call you church I'm going
[8:09] to call you bride so that you will
[8:12] understand listen your name is not miss
[8:14] church your name is not miss your name
[8:18] is Jesus Christ is Jesus Christ the
[8:22] prophet said that the name of God
[8:24] interpreted is the manifestation of the
[8:28] name of God we have not been separated
[8:31] we been from the word to the church we
[8:34] have been separated from the church to
[8:36] the
[8:37] word the church lives by tradition but
[8:41] the bride lives by
[8:43] Revelation separation said always the
[8:47] word requires total and complete
[8:50] separation every one of us here tonight
[8:52] we're on a journey right amen and there
[8:55] are steps in our journey amen we are on
[8:58] a journey of grow
[8:59] can I say that we're on a journey of
[9:01] growth as long as we are here amen we
[9:04] are growing in Christ there is always
[9:07] room to grow that's why you need the
[9:10] revelation of this message spoken over
[9:12] your life on a continual basis is
[9:15] because you're in a journey and you got
[9:18] to grow into the fullness of what God
[9:20] has called you to be now you all know
[9:23] that the natural types the spiritual
[9:25] right and then there's a natural human
[9:27] journey and there's a spiritual journey
[9:30] and the natural human Journey began in
[9:32] your life when you was born amen as an
[9:35] infant and then you grew into a baby and
[9:38] then you grew into a toddler and then
[9:40] you grew into a child and then you grew
[9:42] into a preeing and then you grew into a
[9:44] teenager then you grew into an adult
[9:48] then you grew into an elder see there's
[9:50] a journey and you don't stop growing
[9:52] because there's a fullness that you're
[9:54] headed to Paul says in Ephesians 4:13 he
[9:58] says do we all come in the unity of the
[10:00] faith and of the knowledge of the Son of
[10:03] God to a perfect man but to the measure
[10:06] of the stature of the fullness of Christ
[10:08] watch what Paul says that we henceforth
[10:11] be no more children listen friends you
[10:14] you cannot be born and Skip childhood
[10:17] you got to go to childhood but you can't
[10:19] stay in
[10:21] childhood a calling you to it am let me
[10:25] be no more children toss to and fro yes
[10:28] sir carried about with every wind of
[10:30] Doctrine by the Slate of men and CUNY
[10:33] craftiness whereby they lie and waight
[10:36] to deceive amen but speaking the truth
[10:38] and love Paul says that we may grow up
[10:41] into him in all things which is the head
[10:44] even Christ then don't you ever forget
[10:47] church that God sent a prophet in the AG
[10:50] to preach a sermon called the stature of
[10:53] a perfect man and he built a pyramid and
[10:56] at the bottom of the pyramid it was
[10:58] really wide
[10:59] there was a lot of room but the closer
[11:02] you got to the Capstone the more narrow
[11:05] the pyramid become because the only
[11:08] thing that go can go to H you is
[11:12] perfection PA said amen L not again the
[11:15] foundation of dead work water baptism
[11:18] and repentance under God let us go all
[11:21] un of perfection still not preaching
[11:24] tonight I want to announce to America I
[11:27] want to announce to
[11:29] I want to announce to the organization I
[11:32] want to announce to the caral Believers
[11:34] there is an abrahamic
[11:37] PR who knows she is a to all things that
[11:41] God has is hers she will not lay down
[11:45] she will not quit growing and she will
[11:47] not back up because she knows her
[11:50] potential is in Jesus
[11:52] Christ amen that we may grow look at
[11:56] this word grow it means to cause to grow
[11:59] it means to augment it means to increase
[12:02] to become greater I love what the
[12:04] brother says Born Again Christians amen
[12:06] grow into the stature of Christ as they
[12:08] live they're born again and their lives
[12:11] begin to shape like a baby that's right
[12:13] there it takes form and begins to grow
[12:16] the first thing you know here they are
[12:17] in the full stature amen there you are
[12:20] day after day year after year they stay
[12:22] the same see now they come back to the
[12:25] word and he shows you the place of
[12:27] growth is in the word he say if you
[12:30] abide in me and my words abide in you he
[12:34] said you cannot expect a baby to be born
[12:36] to man it's got to grow to it and we
[12:39] grow in Christ to the full stature not
[12:42] somebody get converted tonight and
[12:44] tomorrow preach the gospel but we grow
[12:47] up somebody say grow up we grow up into
[12:50] manhood into the stature of Christ see
[12:53] that's why Pentecostal babies even could
[12:56] not take this message it was told Beyond
[12:59] a birth it was moving into
[13:03] adoption it was moving beyond gifts it
[13:06] was moving beyond ttimes it was moving
[13:09] beyond emotion it was bringing a
[13:11] stability come on Paul said I ain't got
[13:13] time to teach all this I got to preach
[13:15] it Paul said amen that we be not
[13:17] children talk to and fro with every wind
[13:20] of Doctrine don't get mad at me but
[13:23] somebody that follows every new doctrine
[13:25] that comes around the message is not a
[13:27] manifested son
[13:29] there still a child there still an in
[13:31] there's still a baby what they need to
[13:33] do is settle down somewhere the word of
[13:36] God begin to cause him to come to
[13:39] stability in the message of the hour and
[13:43] we're always talking about how bad the
[13:45] world's getting right but the God said
[13:47] while we're talking about how bad the
[13:49] world is getting he said we're
[13:50] forgetting how powerful the church
[13:53] is at the same time at the same time the
[13:57] world is getting worse the bribe is
[13:59] getting
[14:01] stronger like this he said the church is
[14:04] growing each age is aot in the scripture
[14:07] come through the Holy Spirit Reveals His
[14:10] word by manifesting it and vindicating
[14:13] it his s showing it's his word being
[14:16] brought to pass in the day it's been
[14:19] promised to be brought to pass in listen
[14:22] God is not bringing Noah's promised to
[14:24] pass because this is not Noah's day he's
[14:27] not bringing Moses has promised to pass
[14:30] this is not Moses's day but he's
[14:32] bringing the promise of eloh to this
[14:37] generation it's the age that Elohim will
[14:40] return to the church for the
[14:45] manifestation I preacher watch the
[14:48] manifestation of the word of God is the
[14:51] Vindication that it is the word that's
[14:53] right don't you ever forget that if
[14:56] God's word is God's word and manifested
[15:00] the same one that manifested is the same
[15:02] one that'll vindicate it prove it to you
[15:05] in Genesis 1 he said let there be light
[15:08] let there be light he spoke his word and
[15:12] said let there be light he said then
[15:14] there was light he said see had there
[15:16] been no light then we would have
[15:18] automatically known that it was not
[15:20] God's word that's right he would
[15:23] automatically known that it was not
[15:25] God's word but because there was l
[15:30] was the
[15:31] vation the manifestation of the word of
[15:35] God I heard Prophet say let there be a
[15:38] bride let be a messiah

[17:55] to have to put away childish things and
[17:58] take on manhood which is maturity that's
[18:02] where lot could not go he could not go
[18:05] to maturity he can not go to
[18:07] responsibility he can not go to manhood
[18:10] he stayed inside but there was an
[18:13] Abraham was air to the world he was
[18:16] going all the way if he had to struggle
[18:19] he would struggle if he had to pray he
[18:21] would pray what had to do he was willing
[18:24] to do it because he was anointed to go
[18:27] all the way
[18:30] now can I take two minutes can I take
[18:33] two
[18:34] minutes and break down to you real easy
[18:37] the difference in childhood and manhood
[18:39] go ahead my brother take your time
[18:41] childhood is a kid that wakes up on
[18:44] Thursday morning and they got a scratchy
[18:46] throat and they got a little cough and
[18:49] they don't feel the greatest so they go
[18:51] in the in the living room and they say
[18:54] mom they say Mom I don't feel like going
[18:57] to school m says okay just go back to
[19:00] bed see there's no
[19:03] responsibility what he going to miss a
[19:05] test recess lunch there's no
[19:09] responsibility you take a man that's
[19:12] right that wakes up with the scratching
[19:13] FL and a bad headache he still goes to
[19:17] work you know why because there's a
[19:23] responsibility
[19:27] car yes when
[19:30] responsibility it separates the
[19:32] childhood
[19:35] from a man running from the presence of
[19:38] God because in the presence of God is
[19:41] where man finds
[19:43] responsibility prophets that were always
[19:46] prone Amen to serve responsibility but
[19:49] you know what I say I say what a prophet
[19:51] said we' been babies long enough go
[19:55] right but come on we might as well
[19:57] preach and we might bring that right on
[19:59] in church and then we wake up on Sunday
[20:02] morning and break a fingernail and the
[20:04] car won't start we go back in the house
[20:07] and we'll say well I guess it just God's
[20:09] will for me to go to church today you
[20:12] spiritual baby that's right you
[20:15] spiritual baby I'm an of a spiritual
[20:18] baby and a son of God you let a Son of
[20:21] God wake up on Sunday morning and the
[20:23] car won't start he'll start calling
[20:25] people and he'll start walking the
[20:27] church
[20:29] he knows there a responsibility has L up
[20:32] his life to come to the
[20:37] St HEB over
[20:43] for said we play his children long
[20:46] enough he said when I was a child I
[20:48] spake as a child because he f as a child
[20:51] amen but now it's time we begin to think
[20:54] like men and women should for we got to
[20:57] get down to this
[20:59] I
[21:00] believe I believe in the spiritual
[21:02] growth of the believer I believe what

[21:07] newborn babes desire the sincere milk of
[21:10] the word that she may grow thereby yes

[23:44] time and the promises of
[23:48] the now I'm going to say it to his as I
[23:51] know how go ahead Israel's Journey had
[23:53] stages Israel in Egypt Israel in the
[23:56] wilderness Israel in the promise land
[23:58] Israel in the homelands look at
[24:00] Deuteronomy 2 verse1 it said we turned
[24:04] and took our journey into the Wilderness
[24:06] by the way of the Red Sea that's right
[24:09] the Lord spake unto me and said we've
[24:11] compassed this m many days and the Lord
[24:15] spake unto me saying he have compassed
[24:19] this mountain long enough turn
[24:24] [Music]
[24:25] you it's time to turn
[24:31] on Church in other words be on this
[24:35] mountain more to
[24:40] your this m more to your journey saying
[24:46] the Red Sea was a part of their Journey
[24:48] but Sten they had to go there but they
[24:50] couldn't stay there that's right they
[24:52] had to go to G but they couldn't stay
[24:55] there they had to go to the Wilderness
[24:57] but they couldn't stay there it was
[25:00] ordained to go to the promised land but
[25:02] the was
[25:06] C now think about this Israel was on a
[25:10] journey and brother said by automobile
[25:13] they would have been there in tre in an
[25:14] hour and a half that's right automobile
[25:17] would have had him there in an hour and
[25:18] a half he said by foot they would have
[25:20] been there in tre 4 days yes sir right
[25:24] but instead he said what did they do
[25:26] they wandered for 4
[25:28] ear pre my they were shouting at the Red
[25:32] Sea that's right they were dancing at
[25:34] the Red Sea that's right the test
[25:35] Masters was dead behind and God said you
[25:39] got to go
[25:40] on I mean come on brother we're shouting
[25:44] brother we're dancing surely we found
[25:47] made it God said that's a stage but
[25:50] there's more to it let me just tell what
[25:52] a problem say he said a short Journey
[25:55] amen turned into years of wanding in the
[25:59] wilderness see all because they chose
[26:02] law over Grace he said Grace had
[26:06] provided them a great faith he said it
[26:08] provided them a Passover Lamb right it
[26:10] provided them a prophet that's right and
[26:12] it provided them an Angel that's right
[26:14] the Passover L was for their sins the
[26:17] prophet was their instructor and the
[26:19] angel was their gu his grace had oh
[26:22] godone but Grace had provided them an
[26:25] escape out of Egypt before they had any
[26:28] law that's right yes before there was a
[26:32] law there was a Grace yes
[26:35] sir before there was a law there was a
[26:39] Grace So before they come in the law and
[26:42] they stopped at the law God had a
[26:45] message of Grace that was provided for
[26:48] them them in the greatest Revival ever
[26:52] seen this revival they seen the powers
[26:54] of God they seen the sunshine mother the
[26:57] rest of the world darkless they seen the
[26:59] mighty hand of God deliver the innocent
[27:01] people they seen all this thing and they
[27:04] still chose law over Grace prise God I'm
[27:08] just going to say what a Propet said he
[27:10] said Israel's journey is a perfect time
[27:13] of the church today he said this
[27:16] children of Israel starting on their
[27:17] Journey perfect time for the church

[34:09] 9 he writes about the blood right are
[34:12] you hearing me and the book of Hebrews
[34:16] is the most debated book in the entire
[34:18] Bible on who wrote it they believe Moses
[34:22] wrote Genesis more than they believe
[34:24] Paul wrote Hebrews but in the end
[34:27] God would send a prophet would say
[34:30] listen oh god listen I believe that Paul
[34:34] wrote the book of Hebrews now some
[34:36] people even around the message brother
[34:38] Steven they said well I've been reading
[34:39] this philosopher and I've been reading
[34:41] this kind but but
[34:44] I'm that a prophet
[34:46] [Music]
[34:52] was PA put my voice the
[35:02] you know why because the book of I'm
[35:05] pring another Ser the book of Hebrews
[35:08] has the
[35:11] key it's the key book of all
[35:14] Paul said the key to the entire C of
[35:17] scripture is found in the book of
[35:19] Hebrews the 13th chapter you know what
[35:21] he said he said it's Jesus Christ the
[35:24] same yesterday today

[35:53] Bible says that Jesus Christ is the same
[35:57] yesterday today and forever you know
[35:59] what that man looked at him and said he
[36:01] said that scripture don't even make
[36:04] sense he said go read the book of
[36:07] Hebrews the 13th chapter right he said
[36:10] and you'll be reading through there and
[36:12] I did it he said you'll be reading
[36:14] through there about about all different
[36:16] kinds of things and then all of a sudden
[36:18] out of nowhere Paul just says Jesus
[36:21] Christ is the same yesterday

[54:01] and I can say with 100% Assurance I have
[54:04] the answer to the devil's
[54:07] question I
[54:10] have to the devil's question it's not
[54:13] education it's not psychology it's not
[54:16] modern worship it's not religious
[54:18] [Music]
[54:24] TR
[54:26] [Applause]
[54:27] [Music]
[54:31] dangerous
[54:32] people because we're one man
[54:35] Invasion going read you the quotes I'm
[54:37] going preaching to you Moses had to get
[54:39] out of the camp of the Egyptians that's
[54:41] in order to fulfill God's will for his
[54:43] life so God went to Moses's camp and
[54:47] Called Moses out of the camp called out
[54:51] called him out of the camp and made him
[54:53] in the form of the p that's right Moses
[54:56] met God and he ran and got his wife and
[54:59] baby and saddled up a mle and took off
[55:02] to Egypt and they said where you going
[55:04] Moses he said going to Egypt to take
[55:07] over they said it's a oneman Invasion
[55:10] well them said the difference was he
[55:11] said he had met God
[55:14] am and there was a people that was
[55:17] trapped in Egyptian confusion and here
[55:20] comes Moses with a pit of fire and
[55:24] announces to them the I am that I am has
[55:27] met me and there's more to your life
[55:30] than being baptized in titles than
[55:33] there's more to your life than follow
[55:35] women preachers there's more to your
[55:37] life than just put your name up are you
[55:39] hearing come on Church don't you forget
[55:42] this Israel Israel met God by the way of
[55:45] a Vindicated Prophet his name
[55:48] mes what the prophet of God said yes sir
[55:51] remember sometimes advancement this is
[55:54] me Advan require separation and God told
[55:57] Moses separate yourself and then he just
[56:00] swallowed up to naan and chorus he said
[56:02] now watch all the signs and wonders
[56:04] Vindicated his presence he said now the
[56:07] man made himself a camp a camp of creed
[56:10] are y'all ready for this can you take
[56:13] this
[56:14] quote a camp of GED and tradition not
[56:18] God's Camp of his word a camp of Their
[56:23] Own god brother says God speaking of God
[56:27] he had to leave them for he is the word
[56:30] amen don't you ever forget this part yes
[56:33] he cannot stay where people are taught
[56:36] out of his
[56:39] word so the minute you bring psychology
[56:42] to a pit it the minute you bring
[56:46] religious ideas to a pit apart from a
[56:49] Vindicated Prophet is the minute you put
[56:51] God outside of the C exactly right my he
[56:55] cannot stay in the camp he can't he
[56:58] never did he must stay exactly where his
[57:00] word is amen when God come among them he
[57:04] walked in but their Traditions had so
[57:07] took his place among them that he was a
[57:09] stranger to them the traditions of the
[57:13] fathers are you ready for this they were
[57:16] washing pants and they were grooving
[57:18] their hair and they were wearing certain
[57:20] buttons on their
[57:23] coat
[57:25] so they were no longer just called
[57:27] Christians they were wearing tape boy
[57:30] pins come on and I'm I'm a this and I'm
[57:34] a that no no but said this he said one
[57:38] said I'm a ston Pharisee and the other
[57:40] one's a sad and that had all taken the
[57:43] place of the word of God Among those men
[57:45] till when God come to Vis that he was a
[57:47] foreigner may I say this with love and
[57:49] respect but to drive it home it's the
[57:52] same thing today
[57:56] it hasn't changed a bit when he comes
[57:59] among the people in his power and
[58:01] manifestation to prove that his word is
[58:03] the same as today and forever that's
[58:05] right cuz he is the word what people
[58:08] says fortune tell else about Jesus only
[58:10] something like that some class you
[58:12] somewhere but it has to be that way amen
[58:17] amen can I can I leave you this go ahead
[58:20] my traditional teaching preach my
[58:23] brother preach my from the word
[58:26] crucifies the effect of the manifested
[58:30] Vindicated word of the
[58:33] hour traditional teaching apart from the
[58:37] word crucifies the effect of the
[58:41] manifested and Vindicated word let it
[58:45] speak for itself God
[58:49] God when the light shown up they didn't
[58:52] have to stand there explain it
[58:56] does God keep his word well there's the
[58:59] light that's it and Jesus said am you
[59:03] make the word of God of n effect through
[59:06] your tradition amen amen look at this
[59:09] word effect ter render void are you
[59:11] ready for this to deprive the force and
[59:15] Authority so tradition literally
[59:18] deprives the message of its force and
[59:20] Authority that's exactly right that's
[59:23] exactly right
[59:25] well I'm this exactly right they desired
[59:28] a denomination tradition instead of the
[59:31] true word being manifested and prove
[59:33] that it's God amongst the people are
[59:35] y'all ready for this by science through
[59:38] pictures a the same Angel of the Lord
[59:42] with pill of
[59:44] fire so they take this
[59:47] down my and they put up hofman's head of
[59:51] Christ confusion now don't get mad at me
[59:55] I believe in hman head of Christ but a
[59:57] prophet said that's a
[1:00:00] painting that is a
[1:00:06] painting to what he looked like when I
[1:00:09] saw him in the sa
[1:00:11] field his blow in the wind right he said
[1:00:15] that's the closest thing so what they do
[1:00:17] brother is they take the Vindicator down
[1:00:20] and they put up a painting and say now
[1:00:22] let's all just focus on Jesus
[1:00:26] so what they do is they take the fire
[1:00:29] out of the church and they replace it
[1:00:32] with a pain in
[1:00:35] time but don't you ever forget this
[1:00:39] we're not following a pillar of
[1:00:42] us it's a pillar of
[1:00:45] time it's
[1:00:47] AIC
[1:00:53] manifestes
[1:00:56] [Applause]
[1:00:56] [Music]
[1:00:59] the same one that on the earth in the
[1:01:02] body of Jesus Christ come upon his
[1:01:05] people last day were scientists took the
[1:01:08] picture of it the church is seeing it
[1:01:10] it's identified by TS and everything
[1:01:14] around and
[1:01:15] around yes sir yes sir GL they I'm
[1:01:21] closing they think the Traditions is of
[1:01:23] God but it won stand up with a word and
[1:01:26] neither does God vindicate it to be
[1:01:29] [Music]
[1:01:31] right the Jews did when the veil was
[1:01:34] written and brought brought God into
[1:01:35] Plain View hanging on the cross he was
[1:01:37] in plain view but they couldn't see it
[1:01:39] could it be possible amen that the
[1:01:41] Gentiles has did the same thing when
[1:01:43] they had the church ages of the Son of
[1:01:45] God but with now the veil of this
[1:01:48] denomination and things the veil of
[1:01:50] tradition that we've got since Pentecost
[1:01:54] with the Church Traditions has been rent
[1:01:56] things that people saying days of
[1:01:58] Miracles has passed and God has took the
[1:02:01] veil off of it and brought in plain view
[1:02:04] am amen and they're ready to crucify it
[1:02:08] again yes sir so 2,000 years ago he
[1:02:14] walked up Mount Calvary Lord do off his
[1:02:17] Hill laid down on a cross give up his
[1:02:21] life right they nailed his hands they
[1:02:24] nailed his feet they driven his side
[1:02:27] they crowned of thorns on his head hung
[1:02:30] him up and said crucify yes yep
[1:02:34] Hallelujah today yep they bring the
[1:02:37] message of the hour and the word of God
[1:02:39] look said they lay it on a wooden pit
[1:02:42] and with those denominational Creed
[1:02:44] nails they crucify the word of
[1:02:50] [Music]
[1:02:50] [Applause]
[1:02:53] God
[1:02:54] why because their Camp has set its
[1:02:58] boundary it wouldn't let them it
[1:03:00] wouldn't let him in the camp and it
[1:03:03] wouldn't let
[1:03:05] anybody watch this the reason they hated
[1:03:08] him is he was a breaker of their
[1:03:12] tradition he was an
[1:03:15] upet their
[1:03:17] churches exactly right to me he was a
[1:03:20] fortune teller he said and I believe if
[1:03:22] he come among us today he would be the
[1:03:25] same thing to us for we have tradition
[1:03:27] we have denomination we can't even get
[1:03:29] along with one another why there's only
[1:03:31] one place that a man can get along
[1:03:34] that's under the shed
[1:03:36] [Music]
[1:03:37] blood don't get mad at
[1:03:42] me Jesus walked to the Feast of Passover
[1:03:46] they're holding kosher bread in
[1:03:49] commemoration of what God done for him
[1:03:52] brother said like this he said this was
[1:03:54] at the Feast of Passover and Jesus
[1:03:56] walked in their
[1:03:57] midst and they were drinking from a
[1:04:00] fountain and holding the culture in
[1:04:02] commemoration of the man that F in the
[1:04:04] wilderness and Jesus cried right out in
[1:04:06] the
[1:04:07] midst and said I am the bread of life
[1:04:11] your fathers drank Mana or drank water
[1:04:13] out of the Rock and they're every one
[1:04:15] dead right
[1:04:18] right see what was once a blessed symbol
[1:04:22] had become a blinding
[1:04:25] tradition
[1:04:26] that's right there can I can I can I
[1:04:29] leave your F and I'm going
[1:04:31] home don't ever let anybody put any
[1:04:35] pressure on you when your righteous
[1:04:38] indignation Rises up when the message is
[1:04:41] being crucified in your
[1:04:46] presence come on Church
[1:04:50] well people now now I'm not against
[1:04:53] stream not
[1:04:55] okay the people get on stream and do and
[1:04:57] say things and send it in churches and
[1:05:01] then pastors like brother Steven have to
[1:05:02] get and corrected and then all of a
[1:05:04] sudden they've got the wrong Spirit they
[1:05:06] don't love right right no I tell you why
[1:05:09] it's because you're not sending your
[1:05:12] tradition EXA into the Bride of Jesus
[1:05:16] Christ and the Bethlehem dwellers
[1:05:18] holding their
[1:05:19] peace we've held our peace long enough
[1:05:22] we've taken a back long enough we get
[1:05:26] say well we need to get people to Christ
[1:05:28] to not the message long enough we're
[1:05:30] done with them Traditions let the word
[1:05:32] of God re in power and
[1:05:36] manifestation ration and dation in the
[1:05:39] midst of the
[1:05:47] church
[1:05:49] musicians we will not back up to the
[1:05:51] Miss no sir we will bow our need to
[1:05:55] tradition we're not
[1:05:57] Baptist we're not
[1:06:00] Pentecostal we're not Methodist we're
[1:06:04] Believers we have a right to this
[1:06:11] [Applause]
[1:06:12] word says why do y'all get up there and
[1:06:14] hark about the message we ain't harking
[1:06:16] we're preaching get it
[1:06:19] right
[1:06:21] Hallelujah can I tell you why that when
[1:06:23] somebody begins to crucify the effect of
[1:06:25] this message in your presence something
[1:06:27] Rises up within you can I proe it to you
[1:06:30] by the Bible because Revelation 18 the
[1:06:32] same voice of Revelation 18:4 is in
[1:06:35] Malachi 4 is in Revelation 10:7 is
[1:06:38] revelation 3 AM the voice of the seventh
[1:06:41] angel on Earth echoing the message from
[1:06:43] Heaven and the message from Heaven is
[1:06:45] come out of her my
[1:06:48] people right can I tell you the very
[1:06:51] next chapter from Revelation 18 is
[1:06:54] Revelation 19 and the prophet says when
[1:06:56] he comes he's going to be called the
[1:06:58] word of God riding upon a white horse
[1:07:02] and the followers of
[1:07:04] heaven will be behind
[1:07:08] him see that's why we can't hold our
[1:07:11] peace it's cuz we've got Captain Jesus's
[1:07:16] J inside of us and the prophet said what
[1:07:20] he done we'll do what he done we'll do
[1:07:23] you know what he done he broke the
[1:07:25] denominational Veil he broke the veil of
[1:07:27] tradition he broke the veils that was H
[1:07:30] for you he broke the veil of PR
[1:07:34] Kings like it he broke every no matter
[1:07:37] what PhD ml says if it's contrary to
[1:07:41] that Bible he broke that Veil we cross
[1:07:44] the Rhythm Veil we're on the other side
[1:07:47] now and you will see if you'll just do
[1:07:50] that break those old traditions and
[1:07:52] things and come to him you will see him
[1:07:55] standing Mighty conquer the Word of
[1:07:58] Promise to this age made manifest you'll
[1:08:00] see the Mighty God unveiled you'll see
[1:08:03] him right here Among Us unveiled the
[1:08:07] Mighty God
[1:08:10] am unconquered by
[1:08:16] tradition he's not conquer my tradition
[1:08:19] and neither is his
[1:08:22] Bri

[1:08:39] message are you hearing me tonight it's
[1:08:42] a powerful message exactly
[1:08:45] right the message of the hour is the
[1:08:48] plum line for the

[1:08:52] Bri can I can I ask you something yes

[1:12:57] the word of God and what a prophet
[1:12:59] T and Lord because they think that
[1:13:01] things brother said are a little too
[1:13:04] radical or they're a little too far out

[1:13:08] refined and Polished way to approach the

[1:13:46] altar out of tradition we're coming by
[1:13:49] revelation we lay our lives down and

[1:14:13] your Eagles the word of God for the hour
