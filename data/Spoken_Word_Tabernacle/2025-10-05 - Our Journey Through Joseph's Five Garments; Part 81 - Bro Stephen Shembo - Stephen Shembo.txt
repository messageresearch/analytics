========================================

woman was the one that was changed over for the perversion. That's right. See where the beauty takes her to. Now, that's why that today we find that women is on the increase of beauty. You take Pearl Brian. You ever see her picture supposed to be America's great beauty? There isn't a school kid out of any school, but what would have her in a a back row? Did you know it's supposed to be that way? &gt;&gt; Did you know the Bible speaks that that's the way it's going to be? &gt;&gt; Do you know the fall came by women at the beginning and fall the end is going to wind up the same way. &gt;&gt; Women coming into authority and ruling over man and so forth. You know the scripture says that &gt;&gt; you know the day that she puts on man's clothes and bobs their hair. &gt;&gt; All those things are contrary to God's word. And &gt;&gt; you know she represents the church. when you watch what women are doing and you'll see what the church is doing. &gt;&gt; That's exactly right. &gt;&gt; Now, now that's just as true as the word of God is true. No other female is made that can stoop like a woman can. And yet through that being made an off she was not in the original creation. All other females is in the original creation.

[Music] As a request of the pastor this morning, we're going to take a few minutes before we sing and pray together as a congregation. You can either pray out loud as you're led or you can play pray silently and then we'll finish up up here and go into our song service this morning. Amen. Thank you heavenly father this opportunity.

Lord, we ask a special anointing this morning on our congregation, Lord God. That as the word comes forth, Lord, may you come down and vindicate it, Lord, with your presence, Lord. Make yourself known this morning, Lord God. We know you're here, Lord. You've promised to meet us here every time that we gather, Lord God. And we're not going to doubt that one bit, Lord God. We give ask for travel mercy, Lord, on those that are still on the way, Lord God. Bless our musicians, Lord. Give them a special anointing as well this morning, Lord God. And our singers, Lord God. Bless our technicians as well, Lord God. We thank you for the diligence, Lord, about making everything just come out right. Lord, here and on the stream, Lord God. Bless our deacons, Lord. We pray for our deacons constantly, Lord. That they follow your leadership, Lord, and that they're yielded to your spirit, Lord. We thank you, Father, for our deacons, Lord, and for the anointing that you've put on them, Lord God. And we just ask that you bless them this morning, Lord God. Bless our trustee, Lord, and our treasurer, Lord, and our pastor, Lord God. We we want to, Lord, just pray to guard the gift, Lord, that you've sent to us, Lord God, through this man, Lord God. For we know that when he stands behind this pulpit, it's not him that is speaking, Lord God, but we are hearing from the throne each time, Lord God. So grant it, Lord, that you would just touch him this morning, Lord. Bless the word that will come forth, Lord. Let it come forth as you've planned, Lord God. And let it sink deep into our hearts this morning, Lord God, that we can truly say, Lord, that our hearts burned along the way this morning, Lord God. We thank you for this congregation, Lord.

And we just ask, Lord God, that you just just come, Lord, and just anoint each one of us for our duties this morning, Lord God. Because it's not a duty so much as is a pleasure to serve you, Lord Jesus, for all the things that you've done for us, Lord God. It's just nothing less than a pleasure to sacrifice ourselves to you, Lord God, and just to give up the life that we might have thought we wanted, Lord Jesus, to serve you, Lord God. Help us, Lord. If anyone is struggling this morning, Lord God, we ask you bless them, Lord. We give you thanks, Father, for everything that you do in the precious name of Jesus Christ. We thank you, Father.

Um but this poor child needs prayer. Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; And I just want to say how good God is to me. You know, our pastors preach two message back to back. You know, he talked last week about Psalms 23, you know, and I want to thank God. And then he preach then he preach a message in the midst of chaos. &gt;&gt; And in the midst of the chaos, sometime we don't see how blessed we are. And I just want to say I'm so so so blessed. This week God sent four and you know four is deliverance and I want to thank God for the four God in flesh that came by me in the midst of the chaos and I'm standing here to say I'm one spoiled wife of Jesus Christ and I want to thank him for it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; He's good to us. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Charles, do you mind praying over this prayer request? Yes, ma'am. If we also we want to acknowledge unspoken when we get there. Amen. &gt;&gt; If you could just keep my husband in prayer as he travels for work this week that the Lord gets him there safe and brings him back home. We were reading online that a airplane left from Charlotte to LaGuardia and had a collision. But we know that the angel of the Lord goes with him. So just keep him in prayer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise God. Brother Charles. Amen. Let us pray. Family. Lord Jesus, we thank you Lord God for being able Lord to stand in the gap for one another. Lord God, and Father, when you shed your blood on that cross, Lord God, it was for the whole world, Lord God. And Lord, the blood being shed, heavenly father, didn't only, Lord God, bring our deliverance from sin, Lord God, but it granted our healing, Lord Jesus. And Father, I pray, Lord God, by your grace and mercy, Lord, that you go out, heavenly father, on the spirit of a dove, Lord God, go touch the mind, Lord, of this 16year-old child, Lord God. Father, your prophet said it would be a neurotic age, heavenly father. But Lord, you said, Father, in your word, Father, that you grant us peace that passes all understanding, Lord God. And Father, I pray, heavenly father, for mercy. I pray for grace, heavenly father. I pray for complete and total deliverance, heavenly father, that when we hear the testimony, what God has done, what you have done, heavenly father, proving that you are the same yesterday, today, and forever, heavenly father. Lord God, this is a perfect opportunity, Lord God, for you to prepare the table, Lord God, of this in the presence of that enemy, Lord God, that is troubling that child. What is troubling the child is troubling a family, Lord God. And I pray, heavenly father, Lord, that you pull a wool over Satan's eyes, Lord God, and bring a great and mighty deliverance, Lord Jesus. Father, we pray Lord God for all the unspoken requests, Lord, the things that are hiding in your people's heart, Lord Jesus. Father, that you answer it, heavenly father, Lord, as you use your servant, Lord God, to preach the word, Father, Lord God, anoint them, heavenly father, to answer the request of your people, Father, if that be your will, heavenly father, for we know, Lord, when you speak from behind the sacred desk, Father, it is the greatest blessing that we could ever have, Father, for it is the Lord God himself speaking directly to our situation, Lord Jesus. Father, we give you thanks, heavenly father. We commit the remainder of this service into thy hands, Lord Jesus. Father, we pray, Lord, that you remember the tithes and the offerings, Lord God, and use them for the furtherance of your kingdom, Lord God. We see you're doing the supernatural work, Father, and the erection, Lord God, of the fellowship hall, Lord, in the addition to the building, Lord God. We pray, Lord God, for a total restoration of all things, Father, because before the foundation of the world, Lord God, you saw it, heavenly father. We're just trying to step into the vision, Lord God, of what you prepared, Lord God. Help us to touch and agree with our pastor, Lord God. Lord, this is true work of the third pole, the creative power of God, Lord God, anointed him, Lord God. All we need to do, Lord God, is follow the shepherd, Lord God, the undersheperd, Lord God, that you have given us, Lord God. We ask you these things, Lord God, in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. I have one announcement and then we're going to ask Sister Lily and brother um Tony to come up. Um as y'all notice coming in there is a new framework around the um entrance down here. Uh it is a metal framework. Brother Robert has put um some more of the caution tape around it because um this this framework has some sharp edges to it. So, we want to ask the parents to kind of monitor the kids that they don't um stick their hands in there and and uh possibly get them cut or or you know, damaged or something. So, just um try to keep that in mind as we exit this afternoon. Amen. Y'all see the progress out there, right? It's moving right along. It's a vision manifesting. Amen. Praise God. So, we're going to ask Brother Tony and Sister Lily to come up and bless us with a song. And then we have Sister Yokth and Brother Tony as well. Amen. We're going to work these gifts. Praise God.

If you finish cood book, you should be built up pretty strong. Amen. &gt;&gt; Our church ages, 70 weeks of Daniel, the seals adoption, or someone is listening or reading the message of the hour. Amen. &gt;&gt; Lord's willing, this oncoming Saturday, which is going to be October the 11th, is our question and answer. My daughter call it Q&A. I was like, what is Q&A? What is this Q&A? So I figure out his question and answer. Amen. So our question and answer will be on October the 11th. Same place. You know where it is. But the information should be put on the deacon chat. So Lord's willing on Wednesday is the the the last question before I pick it up. So don't send question on Thursday or Friday because I'm already working on something. Amen. And the youngsman meeting will follow on October the 25th part three of the courtship. And Lord's willing, the married couple meeting will be on December the 13th where we get on to finances uh part two, but it's going to be part eight for the married couple meeting. Amen. Um how was the church prayer on Tuesday? [Applause] those that were not there just understand by God's grace we will see as the time move on if we need need to put another day that will have other people also so if you miss the one on Tuesday you have the one on uh on uh uh let me keep the date on X day and then we see what we can do amen but Lord's willing I don't think one hour worked because we went beyond one hour. We were like an hour and 30 minutes and at the last minute I have to put all the prayer requests together. Normally we should have read the prayer request and pray for it. Read and pray for it. So just the what I'm trying to say is open up for two hours. &gt;&gt; Amen. So open up for two hours. If we go two hour just be prepared for it. No problem. Just know it's two hours. Amen. Glory to God. So again, the last request is taken on Tuesday at 5:00. Then uh at 6:45 we open up the zoom and we start again. The zoom will be sent. Usually sister Adasa put the zoom by uh uh by today the zoom is already up and waiting for you for Tuesday. So as soon as we receive it, we go ahead and send it and we move on. We even have some of the invisible audience first times to to see them. So now I know who is who who's putting some amen. God bless you and welcome to Spoken Word Tabernacle. Amen. I spoke uh u I communicated with the deacon and also the song leader. I believe you already noticed it this morning when brother John came up. He gave you time to pray as a congregation first before he uh he closes and start the song service. So make sure you there when the song service started on time because uh before we start the song service we will give you few minute to go ahead and pray as a congregation. We believe you prayed already at home. &gt;&gt; So when you get here we pray a little bit as a congregation. Pray for the service then brother John closes and we start. Amen. &gt;&gt; We clear on that one. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The building you already uh uh heard the the the instruction about it. Just try to stay away from the metal that they're placing there. It's razor sharp, so we don't want any problem. Brother Robert already put a tape there. When you see the tape, watch it, but don't touch it. Are we together? You can watch it, but don't touch it until they close everything. Amen. You keep playing, but I mean praying for us because the Abraham Lincoln is already there and we're doing work. So, I'm catching up on bills. I'm behind bills and catching up by God's grace when we we we are bringing things low then we got to purchase new new new material and then we go back. So it's like up and down up and down but slowly and gradually we are moving on before you know it everything will be done. So stay in prayer and also remember your contribution. Sister Adasa worked very hard on this. Congratulations sister Adasa. So as a pastor, let me put this together. The technician work together good &gt;&gt; by God's grace. But uh those that are online, if you go on the YouTube channel for spoken word, when you open the channel on YouTube, there is an option that says view channel. If you click that option, it will give you another option that says more. If you click more, every single link is there. If you need our website link, the contribution link for the t for the building fund for everything has been laying there. So you don't have to ask how to send money or whatever you want to do. It's already on YouTube channel. So everything if you click the link automatically take you to the website or take you to whatever contribution you want to do, it's there. Again, I'm going to repeat it again. View channel. When you click view channel, click more. Everything will appear. So now we believe that we solve everything that supposed to be done online. Amen. &gt;&gt; I believe I got everything clear. Young sisters, if you have any other subject, just uh send me a message or the deacon and let's sit again and let's talk. But it looks like there's no more subject to go. God bless you. I don't remember your name again. What her name again? &gt;&gt; So, go ahead and stand up so we can welcome you. Praise God. Welcome to Spoken Word Tabernacle. You may be seated. It has been a long long maybe years or something. Welcome and good to see you. Amen. You are home. You're not here as a visitor. You're part of the family. So, I need to hear your amen really loud. Amen. God bless you. You might be seated. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord, Brother Glenn, Brother Tony, Brother Robert. I believe I got everything clear. So, by God's grace, let's go to the word of God. You promise you're going to give me time? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Because we getting closer to 150 and three quote, one sermon. Three court, one sermon. Three court, one sermon. If not, so do you promise? &gt;&gt; Uh, some of you are not that they don't want to say anything. Do you promise you're going to give me time &gt;&gt; so we can reach where we need to reach &gt;&gt; and then he will prepare next Sunday. Right? &gt;&gt; Because I keep pushing sermon. I keep pushing sermon and we are way way down in in uh uh I mean a pify basement over there. We need to come back because everything that we are talking now so it help you to understand where we are. We we are under the blood upon the altar. &gt;&gt; Do you remember that? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; The blood was put on the on the curtain and then the blood was put on the altar. So all of this is under the altar. &gt;&gt; So we need to come out from there and get the blood below &gt;&gt; that goes into the ground. Then when we finish that then we pick up again to the prodigal son. &gt;&gt; And do you see now where we are? And then we come up from the prodigal son and go back to to the I mean the podifar. Then we resurface again and then we take we change the garment. You are already on part 81. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So I'm doing this so I can open somebody that Okay. &gt;&gt; And the year is about to finish. Amen. Flight attend and prepare for takeoff. My subject this morning is our journey, our life journey through Joseph 5 garment part 81. Let's go to Genesis 15. Genesis 15. Part 81. Unbelievable. So if you behind, you on the 40s. Good luck. You have to take three weeks vacation &gt;&gt; to follow up. Amen. &gt;&gt; So stay there so we can move on. If you dare, you can say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So let's go ahead and pray. Heavenly Father, Lord, we are approaching you humbly this morning. Father, thanking you for your grace, your love, your mercy, and for everything you have been doing for us, Lord. Father Lord, this is as as as far as I can go with the ability you have given me. But when it comes to speaking to your brother and ministering to your children, Father, we are totally insufficient. It takes the supernatural action of the Holy Spirit to come to Lord reveal your word to speak to teach to preach to touch to heal to fill and to do everything in our lives Lord. Father that's why we are inviting you once again Lord Father that you can come and move us and the audience visible and invisible completely out of the way. May you speak to us all. May you be the alpha and the omega. Lord father anoint us like never before in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Our life journey through Joseph's five garment part 81. Amen. &gt;&gt; Genesis 15. If you dare, you can say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; My theme this morning, if we can make it there, is season. Let me read it. Well, so I make sure we get it. It's season hidden. hidden in darkness. Season that are hidden in darkness. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Genesis 15. Let's go to verse seven. If you there, you can say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm going to try to stay on the surface with this scripture because this is very deep and it can open up a series. So I'm not going to touch it. I know what is here. I know what brother Brandham say. Brother Brandham usually give you a clue. And if you take the clue of brother Brandham, he open up 25 messages. One clue of brother Brandham 25 message. If you touch the second one, 25 message. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because of the power of the seals. Seven. And he says unto him, this is God talking to Abraham. He says,"I am the Lord that brought you out of earth of the Caldes to give you this land to inherit it." You may be seated. And he said, "Lord, keep your seat belt, we will take off." And he said, "Lord God, whereby shall I know that I shall inherit this?" In other words, God is telling Abraham, I'm going to give you this. And Abraham say, you know what? I need an assurance. Give me something like Rahab. Hey, give me a true token. Amen. I heard your word. I believe your word. But how how will I know that really truly you will be giving me this? Stay in put because the devil won't let you get this. Amen. He says verse 8 and and he said Lord God whereby shall I know that I shall inherit it? Amen. How do I know? Job to verse 12. If you there you can say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I skip all of this because there is many shadow many messages locked in. So that's why I'm skipping this because if you you read it all the three years of he all of that have meaning. So let's stay on where we are going. Verse 12. And when the son in other words Abraham took the sacrifice and put it if you read your Bible and he cut the sacrifice in two except the the dove &gt;&gt; the bird were put aside because that represent divine healing. I'm trying to stay away from it. Don't ask me question now. We will get into something else. The bird represented divine healing. But Abraham took the sacrifice and Abraham split the sacrifice in two. &gt;&gt; And Abraham was there and was chasing the bird from the morning all the way so that no bird fell on the sacrifice. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because God gave him instruction. Take the sacrifice, split them in two. It's a covenant. &gt;&gt; And normally when you make a covenant, it's two people. &gt;&gt; Amen. And brother Brown, I'm explaining about the the the China laundry man where they would take I mean I mean a paper and then they split it in two and then you take one part and we take another part. So when you come to get your clothing they will try to match. If everything match that's your clothing. &gt;&gt; So that's what Abraham is doing here. He split everything. Put there put there. So normally God should be on one side. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then Abraham should be on the other side. But that's not the case. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's not the case. So now Abraham is there chasing flies so they don't come and eat his sacrifice. &gt;&gt; The Bible says now in verse 12, "And when the sun was going down, in other word on the sunset, &gt;&gt; I hope we are together." &gt;&gt; Not on the sunrise. &gt;&gt; No, &gt;&gt; from the morning he was just chasing sacrifice. But when the sun was going down and the sun set, &gt;&gt; we clear. &gt;&gt; That's when things begin to happen. &gt;&gt; On the sunset, &gt;&gt; when the day was wide, &gt;&gt; the sun was up. &gt;&gt; Nothing happened. Abraham has to just chase bird. &gt;&gt; But when the sun begin to go down &gt;&gt; and darkness begin to come. Amen. &gt;&gt; Relax, relax. &gt;&gt; The sun &gt;&gt; was going out. &gt;&gt; The sun was going down. &gt;&gt; So this is the sunset. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And darkness begin to come in because as the sun is going down, the darkness is coming out. In other words, this is the evening time. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; If you don't read your message, you'll be in trouble. &gt;&gt; This is the evening time. &gt;&gt; And you going very slow. I got two quote that the Holy Spirit gave me there. So, I need to read the day now. I have to read it from my phone. So, let's move on. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Verse 12. And when the sun was going down, &gt;&gt; a deep sleep. &gt;&gt; That's right. fell upon Abraham. &gt;&gt; Normally like I said Abraham Abraham should be on one side and God should be on another side and they are making covenant. &gt;&gt; Now when it comes the time that the covenant need to be made &gt;&gt; because throughout the day there were no covenant. Abraham cut the sacrifice put one here put one there and he was waiting for God. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; In the morning there is no God. Good job, my friend. And noon, no God. &gt;&gt; 300 p.m. No God. &gt;&gt; Abraham is watching his clock. &gt;&gt; And then the bird keep coming trying to get some steak. And then Abraham is keep say where is God? Where is God? Where is God? Then suddenly in the evening time &gt;&gt; when the sun &gt;&gt; when the sun begin to go down. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; My brother who was working so strong &gt;&gt; waiting on God &gt;&gt; fell asleep &gt;&gt; and not just asleep. &gt;&gt; A deep one. I'm doing this so I'm helping you to catch up whoever he's thinking &gt;&gt; a deep sleep. &gt;&gt; So how is he going to get into a covenant &gt;&gt; sleeping? &gt;&gt; If you want to understand this per perfectly me and brother Angela here we need to make a deal. &gt;&gt; There is a paper &gt;&gt; I have to sign. Brother Angelo have to sign for the contract to be valid. Now when it comes time to son, brother Angel is sleeping. &gt;&gt; So now how am I going to sound? &gt;&gt; We need to wake him up. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; But this sleep is different. &gt;&gt; It's not a sleep that you push somebody and they wake up quickly. It was a deep one. &gt;&gt; So my brother got some anesthesia. Very good. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. Why is the party that need to be involved in the contract be put to a deep sleep? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We together. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said the reason why it happened to Abraham. If you need coach, see me after church. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham say God want to take Abraham out of the picture. &gt;&gt; I hope we together. Brother Brandham say because every contract God have with man, &gt;&gt; man always fell. &gt;&gt; I hope we together. &gt;&gt; And then when he started with Abraham, the father of our faith, &gt;&gt; God said, "Now Abraham, I'm going to start something different. &gt;&gt; And I don't need your input. [Applause] &gt;&gt; I don't need you to tell me what to do. I don't even want you to get there &gt;&gt; because if I put you on the covenant, the devil will attack you. &gt;&gt; I'm going to be the only one in the covenant. &gt;&gt; In other word, in both part, it is God. [Applause] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In other word, if you go on this side, this is the side of God. You look at signature it is God who son. &gt;&gt; If you go back to sister Tasad, &gt;&gt; you say who son here? &gt;&gt; Sister Ca say oh our son. But you look it's not sister Ta. &gt;&gt; It is God who son for sister T. &gt;&gt; And God does not change &gt;&gt; and God will never fail. In other words, it's a covenant where only God and God can do. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham say God took Abraham out of the picture. &gt;&gt; He said because Adam fell. &gt;&gt; I have the quote my friend. &gt;&gt; And God say you know what Adam fell I don't want to take any more chances now. And brother Brandham say it was an unconditional [Applause] &gt;&gt; in other word it has nothing to do with you. &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham say what God was showing was Abraham you have nothing to do in this. &gt;&gt; In other words this contract will never fair &gt;&gt; because it's not a human contract. It is a divine contract. &gt;&gt; It is a contract that is based on deity &gt;&gt; and deity never fail. &gt;&gt; In other words, we are doomed to succeed. [Applause] &gt;&gt; You didn't get me well. In other words, we are doomed to make it. No matter what's going to happen there because it's not you to keep the contract. It's the one who son that need to keep the contract. It is the one whose son that need to keep their word. And God and his word are one. &gt;&gt; And the Bible say heaven and earth will pass away but the word &gt;&gt; never pass away. &gt;&gt; In other words, your life is not your own. I don't know if we together. &gt;&gt; I don't know if we together. &gt;&gt; Whether you like it or not, &gt;&gt; you didn't sign for it. &gt;&gt; In other words, even if you come today and you say, "I'm leaving the message." &gt;&gt; And I'm going to hell. &gt;&gt; I need to know who sign your paper. [Applause] If you sign it, that's fine. &gt;&gt; But if God sign it, [Applause] &gt;&gt; you won't go nowhere, &gt;&gt; I will see you coming back right here. &gt;&gt; Because it's God who has to keep the contract. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? Okay. Since I'm leaving, I just took off. Let me take my jacket. Keep your seat belt as I coming. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All of this is happening &gt;&gt; when the sun begin to go. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. [Music] &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Abraham is sleeping. &gt;&gt; Abraham, where are you at? You need to sign the contract. &gt;&gt; You need to sign the contract. I'm sorry. I work too much. &gt;&gt; So, who's going to sign the contract &gt;&gt; on behalf of Abraham? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But we know that Abraham was in God. &gt;&gt; Let me leave it my friend. We are way. &gt;&gt; Verse 12. &gt;&gt; Verse 12. &gt;&gt; And when the sun was going down, a what? &gt;&gt; A deep sleep &gt;&gt; did what? &gt;&gt; Fell upon Abraham. &gt;&gt; And lo, a what? &gt;&gt; In horror. &gt;&gt; You know what that is? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Spooky. &gt;&gt; Halloween. &gt;&gt; We not We don't We don't celebrate Halloween, but Halloween is coming. &gt;&gt; Are we clear? &gt;&gt; A horror of a what? Great darkness fell upon him. &gt;&gt; Not not darkness. &gt;&gt; What type of darkness? &gt;&gt; Great darkness. &gt;&gt; The sleep was deep. &gt;&gt; The darkness that came there was not just darkness. &gt;&gt; Oh my brother, &gt;&gt; I don't understand this. God, I I asked God, what shows me you will give me what you say? &gt;&gt; And God say, take a sacrifice. It's right here. I just keep it cuted and put a sacrifice to offer for me. &gt;&gt; I did offer the sacrifice. &gt;&gt; Now instead of the sacrifice bringing God &gt;&gt; the sacrifice is bringing horror. &gt;&gt; It's bringing deep sleep. &gt;&gt; It's bringing even great darkness. So this sacrifice is bringing horror, &gt;&gt; horror, great darkness. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In other word, I was expecting God to come as a mighty angel and light shining around and say, "I am the God of Abraham." &gt;&gt; Suddenly, [Music] &gt;&gt; darkness But God &gt;&gt; dead bodies of animal &gt;&gt; with darkness &gt;&gt; and you telling me this is the confirmation. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Brother Brham said this great darkness and aura was hell. &gt;&gt; I have the quote. Ah, &gt;&gt; come on man. Come on. Come on my friend. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham say this is hell. &gt;&gt; So it looks like what is going to happen in the evening time &gt;&gt; is pulling hell. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hell on Jessie Penny. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; Uh do you read your message? &gt;&gt; Do you read your message? Go read souls that are in prison now. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In the evening time, it looks like hell broke loose. &gt;&gt; And not just hell, great darkness. &gt;&gt; All of this &gt;&gt; because God Abraham asked, he say, "Vindicate, &gt;&gt; vindicate to me that you will give it to me. &gt;&gt; Hell is broke loose. Okay, let's continue. Where are we at, my friend? &gt;&gt; Verse 12. &gt;&gt; Verse 12. You are reading very slow, my friend. &gt;&gt; We should be finishing this. Amen. &gt;&gt; Verse 13. And he says to Abraham. &gt;&gt; Now God come and spoke in the midst of hell. &gt;&gt; Darkness. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There is no light here. &gt;&gt; It's darkness. And then God speak &gt;&gt; in the midst of darkness. &gt;&gt; What is God speaking? &gt;&gt; The the Bible didn't say and light came all over them. &gt;&gt; No, darkness came and God begin to speak when it's dark. &gt;&gt; Which brother Brandham say when hell came down, &gt;&gt; God begin to speak. What is God saying? &gt;&gt; Verse uh 13. &gt;&gt; And he says to who? &gt;&gt; Abraham. No of shortity, in other words, for sure &gt;&gt; that your seed shall be what? &gt;&gt; A stranger &gt;&gt; in the land that is not water. &gt;&gt; So God begin to break things to Abraham. &gt;&gt; That hey, your children will go somewhere else. &gt;&gt; How will they get there? It is stuff in between. &gt;&gt; That's right. Because a mystery always got a supernatural element. &gt;&gt; If he say Joseph, the devil will kill Joseph. &gt;&gt; But Joseph is hidden right there. &gt;&gt; Because it was Joseph that took them to Egypt. &gt;&gt; So he just said they will go to Egypt. But he doesn't say how. &gt;&gt; So under this it's Joseph. It's all the hatred everything is hidden right there. Are we together? So the plan begin to unfold. According to the plan, your people will surge to a strange land. Amen. &gt;&gt; Which we know today it was Egypt. &gt;&gt; And it happened with Joseph. &gt;&gt; We know because it's already finished. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Verse uh uh 13 kama. Uh and shall do what? &gt;&gt; If you notice he say the people shall sjourn and there is a kama. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; A kama may mean a dispensation. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; So there will be a time they will surge &gt;&gt; when they will be treated well because of Joseph. &gt;&gt; Then the Bible say come and the Bible say and serve them. So this is a second stage &gt;&gt; where they will become slave. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together &gt;&gt; because a pharaoh will rise that will not know Joseph. &gt;&gt; We clear. &gt;&gt; So the second one they will serve them &gt;&gt; which mean they will be slave. We clear on that one. &gt;&gt; And if you notice again, you will find that shall serve them and there is another end. &gt;&gt; So you need to be very careful with scripture. &gt;&gt; And they shall do what? &gt;&gt; Afflict them 400 years. &gt;&gt; For what? &gt;&gt; 400 years. &gt;&gt; They will serve them and they will afflict them as a slave. Afflict them for how many years? &gt;&gt; 400 years. &gt;&gt; God, they ask God the question, vindicate this. God begin to explain the seed will go to Egypt and this is what will happen and think Abraham just say vindicated this &gt;&gt; are we &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; are we together &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; verse 14 and also that nation which is Egypt &gt;&gt; sir &gt;&gt; whom they shall serve which is Egypt &gt;&gt; without judge that happened &gt;&gt; so right there is a Moses right there &gt;&gt; but he won't tell you Moses. But Moses is right there. &gt;&gt; So there will come a time of a judgment. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The judgment of Egypt. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Which happened under Moses. &gt;&gt; So the Exodus under a prophet Joseph. &gt;&gt; I mean the going under Joseph and the Exodus under another prophet. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; The Bible say and also that nation whom they shall serve will I judge. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. And after that, and afterward shall they come out with what? &gt;&gt; Great substance. &gt;&gt; So when the judgment of God will begin to pour down upon Egypt, &gt;&gt; do you follow me? &gt;&gt; There will be something that will happen to Israel. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's go very slowly. &gt;&gt; When Israel journey in the strange land, they were in Gan, &gt;&gt; the best of the land. And they prospered so much &gt;&gt; and the Egyptian were jealous. &gt;&gt; Then Egypt came and changed them from VIP people and put them to slavery. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; And they lost everything. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Then the judgment came with Moses. Came the third exodus. &gt;&gt; The ex I mean the exodus. The first Exodus came right there. Amen. But before Moses pulled them out, &gt;&gt; when the judgment is failing, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God says something to Abraham. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We clear &gt;&gt; in the midst of all the mess. &gt;&gt; God says something to Abraham. &gt;&gt; What is he telling Abraham &gt;&gt; in verse 14? He say, "And afterward &gt;&gt; shall they, the people of Israel, &gt;&gt; they shall come out how?" &gt;&gt; With great substance. &gt;&gt; Break that down. &gt;&gt; So Israel will leave Egypt. How? [Applause] &gt;&gt; What is wrong? &gt;&gt; Israel will leave Egypt. How? rich. &gt;&gt; So when you see judgment falling left and right, &gt;&gt; are we together? &gt;&gt; In the midst of that judgment, sir, &gt;&gt; there is a period of time. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; That Israel will be favored. &gt;&gt; I hope we together. &gt;&gt; There is a period of time Amen. &gt;&gt; A period of time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A season. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That Israel will get great. &gt;&gt; Is my Bible different than yours? &gt;&gt; Great. What? &gt;&gt; Substance. &gt;&gt; This substance we need to know. How will Israel get it? [Music] Because some of you think Israel will go get doctor's degree &gt;&gt; to get this substance. Some of you think the Jews will be working three jobs &gt;&gt; so that they will get more income. &gt;&gt; Some of you think the Jews will open up businesses. to get this substance. &gt;&gt; We need to know how did they get the substance. &gt;&gt; God just say they will get it. &gt;&gt; That's all I know. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Job to verse 17. We almost finishing this. You're doing good. Great job. Spoken word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Verse 17. If you there, we can say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And it came to pass that when the sun went down, &gt;&gt; now darkness naturally and darkness spiritually because there was a darkness that came down. &gt;&gt; Now the sun is completely down. &gt;&gt; It is a night &gt;&gt; plus darkness. &gt;&gt; Great darkness plus night. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When the sun was going went down. Amen. Amen. If you notice on verse 12, he said the sun was going down. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; But now it's not going. &gt;&gt; The sun is down. &gt;&gt; Darkness upon the earth &gt;&gt; and then there is great darkness &gt;&gt; and hell is there &gt;&gt; because now it's night. &gt;&gt; This is night &gt;&gt; plus hell. So you can come up with your own uh I mean recipe &gt;&gt; how dark it is &gt;&gt; because this dark because this hell came with great darkness. &gt;&gt; It's right here. &gt;&gt; Great darkness. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We together. &gt;&gt; Verse 17. And it came to pass that when the sun went down, &gt;&gt; no more light. And he was light. &gt;&gt; Dark. &gt;&gt; Ah, we clear. And it was dark kama. Behold a what? &gt;&gt; A smoking furnace. &gt;&gt; Where did the furnace came? Brother say that was hell ramen. &gt;&gt; In other word hell completely unleash. &gt;&gt; It is dark. There is no sun, nothing, no more light. It is dark. The Bible say it's dark. Hell is there. A great furnace of hell is right there. &gt;&gt; And Abraham is right there. Abraham is not away. He's right there. God didn't remove Abraham &gt;&gt; because God need to make a covenant. &gt;&gt; God left Abraham there but he just put Abraham in the stage where Abraham doesn't have to do anything. &gt;&gt; It is all in the responsibility of God. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? The Bible says, "And it was dark come behold a what? &gt;&gt; A smoking furnace &gt;&gt; and a what? &gt;&gt; A burning lamp." &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; Now we see a lamp. &gt;&gt; In another translation, it's a light &gt;&gt; that begin to come in the midst of darkness. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? And what is the light doing? &gt;&gt; Because remember we already separated our sacrifice. &gt;&gt; But now the light is coming when hell is there. In other words, when hell has established completely, &gt;&gt; the light now begin to come. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In other words, Abraham saw something like &gt;&gt; it's moving. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And brother Brandham say uh uh let me stop let me read face. He says and a burning lamp that did what? &gt;&gt; Passed between those pieces. &gt;&gt; Ah &gt;&gt; a burning lamp was doing what? &gt;&gt; Pass between those pieces. &gt;&gt; So who was confirming the conf? Because Abraham is sleeping &gt;&gt; and brother Brandham said for those who are still thinking brother Brham said that burning lamp was the pillar of fire. [Applause] Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; So, in other word, when in the midst of hell, &gt;&gt; in the midst of gross darkness, &gt;&gt; when there is no more sun &gt;&gt; and the light is gone, God came down himself &gt;&gt; and passed between the pieces. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; To confirm the covenant. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Some of you don't know what passes between the pieces means. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Passes between the pieces means this. &gt;&gt; It means if I'm standing between the two pieces right here, &gt;&gt; amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said what he meant is if any of us &gt;&gt; break the covenant, You will be dead &gt;&gt; as the pieces that are dead. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; So Abraham was supposed to go through that himself. &gt;&gt; But God put Abraham aside. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. And God himself &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; God passed through the covenant &gt;&gt; not as Jesus Christ. Please keep your seat belt. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I don't know why everything I planned to move on. It's not working. Uh God pass in between the covenant &gt;&gt; not as Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. There is a reason why they say Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; There's a reason why they say that. &gt;&gt; Are we together? This is a man. in the man. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; That's why when Jesus said the son of man will be killed, the Jews look they say but Christ abide forever. &gt;&gt; In other words, you cannot kill Christ. &gt;&gt; Christ is immortal. &gt;&gt; So how do you say you are the Christ and you going to die? &gt;&gt; No. Jesus here was a lamb. &gt;&gt; And this one who died on Calvary. &gt;&gt; Are we together? But this one is immortal. [Applause] &gt;&gt; This one cannot die. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; But both of them are one. &gt;&gt; Are we together? One is the physical manifestation &gt;&gt; and one is the invisible God &gt;&gt; made visible as a light. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? Have I lost you? If I lost you, raise your hand. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; So instead of God passing as Jesus, &gt;&gt; you can kill the man Jesus. He died on the cross. God pass Christ &gt;&gt; as the immortal one &gt;&gt; showing that if something doesn't work &gt;&gt; you need to kill Christl [Music] &gt;&gt; but Christ does not die. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah Jesus. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. So in the midst are we together? So in the midst of all this chaos &gt;&gt; of hell &gt;&gt; we find that rather lays a unconditional covenant &gt;&gt; that God himself soul &gt;&gt; not by you by himself. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Because there is no one greater than him. He must swear by himself that if I don't give you what I say, &gt;&gt; you kill me. [Applause] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; In other words, God put himself at stake &gt;&gt; to make sure you are real. In other words, if you need an assurance, &gt;&gt; Abraham, that I'm going to do what I say I'm going to do. &gt;&gt; I put myself to be dead. If I don't do what I told you to do, you kill me. [Applause] &gt;&gt; But remember, I don't die. [Music] &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we clear? &gt;&gt; We clear, right? &gt;&gt; Let's go to our second scripture in Exodus 12. I won't congratulate you again because you would go slow. &gt;&gt; Let's go to our second scripture. I know you very well &gt;&gt; if you there you can say amen. &gt;&gt; I know the devil will fight you all here not to understand this but we started last week we could not finish. So let's let's go there. Amen. &gt;&gt; Exodus 12. So don't turn your clock yet. I'm reading the Bible. &gt;&gt; Uh Exodus 12. If you there, you can say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's go to verse 11 because we need to know how. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Did Israel get the substance? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When they tell you get the substance, some of you are more spiritual. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Amen. &gt;&gt; The substance God give you really it's not for you. &gt;&gt; That's right, brother. &gt;&gt; Even though you will enjoy it. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God will give you two napkins. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And you who are spiritual, you say, "Give me one." &gt;&gt; He gave you. &gt;&gt; But when he gave you two, he knows why he's giving you two. because he knows you would take one and give to brother Greg. That's exactly right. &gt;&gt; And but you are too spiritual. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Too humble. &gt;&gt; Okay, let's go. I have to say that to break something. So we move on. Let's go to uh 11. If you dare, you can say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Verse 11. And thus this is Moses giving instruction for the Exodus. Yes, &gt;&gt; because now Israel is about to leave. &gt;&gt; But remember there was a promise when they about to leave when everything is chaos a mess. In other words, if you go in in Egypt, things are broken, building down because the hell came and destroyed the cuddle and everything in the midst of that that chaos. &gt;&gt; Israel, you must focus on one thing. Amen. &gt;&gt; Verse uh 11. And thus shall you eat it. God gave them the instruction about the lamb. Kill the lamb and take the blood to put in the lentil and roast the lamb with a fire and everything. Then God is saying them is is uh is talking to them that this is how you going to eat. Because Israel was not ready to leave. &gt;&gt; Israel was not leaving yet. &gt;&gt; He was ready to leave. I'm going to repeat it again &gt;&gt; because I'm going somewhere. Israel was not leaving yet. &gt;&gt; Israel is still in Egypt, &gt;&gt; but they already know they are leaving. &gt;&gt; Are we together? And God come &gt;&gt; before they leave. &gt;&gt; And God say that shall you eat it &gt;&gt; with your what? &gt;&gt; Loins girded. &gt;&gt; So God didn't say because you leaving don't eat. I'm getting somewhere. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God say eat it. &gt;&gt; But when you eat it, have your pants on. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together &gt;&gt; with your belt on. &gt;&gt; In other word, be like somebody who's traveling. &gt;&gt; But still stay and eat. &gt;&gt; We will get there. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Ah, are we together? &gt;&gt; He says, "And that shall you eat it?" How? &gt;&gt; With your loins girded. &gt;&gt; Come out with what? &gt;&gt; Your shoes on your feet. &gt;&gt; In other words, remember you are living. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Because if they tell you you're living, you don't care about food. &gt;&gt; If you're taking a flight, &gt;&gt; you don't care about food. God said because God did not tell them when they would leave. &gt;&gt; I'm going somewhere. &gt;&gt; God only tell them be ready [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; sir &gt;&gt; to make it easy on you. &gt;&gt; Brother Charles is right here with a tie on, with a shoes on. God say be like that. Amen. &gt;&gt; But just know you will leave. &gt;&gt; So when you eat like that, &gt;&gt; if you want to talk to your neighbor like that, &gt;&gt; so that when the flight come, &gt;&gt; you don't need to go put your clothes on, your clothes are on &gt;&gt; for the flight at any time. [Applause] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Are we Please help me. Are we together? &gt;&gt; How do you eat, my friend? &gt;&gt; With your loins girded. &gt;&gt; If If God will help you with your loins girded and what else? &gt;&gt; Your shoes on your feet. &gt;&gt; Your shoes on your feet. &gt;&gt; On your feet. This is at your house. &gt;&gt; You want to eat? God say not barefooted. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Make sure you put your nice uh Sunday shoes on, then go eat with it because I don't want to come and you say, "Ah, let me get my socks. Get your socks. Put your socks on." In other words, when I park on the parking lot like a Uber, when I do this, you just enter and we go. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; You are eating with what? Your loans ged and what? &gt;&gt; Your shoes on your feet. &gt;&gt; And what else? &gt;&gt; Your staff in your hand. &gt;&gt; Ah, in other way, even your staff is already there. &gt;&gt; Everything is there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Your staff in your hand. &gt;&gt; Don't say uh where where is my cane? Where did I get your cane around? When you go into the bathroom, go with your cane. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; With your stuff on you. Continue, my friend. &gt;&gt; Shall eat it in haste. &gt;&gt; And you shall eat it how? in haste. &gt;&gt; Fast. It is what? &gt;&gt; The Lord's Passover. You eating that fast in haste. If it's a haste, there is an urgency. &gt;&gt; Are we clear? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Job to verse 12. Amen. Uh, that was 11. Job to verse 12. For I will pass water &gt;&gt; through the land of Egypt this night. &gt;&gt; This night. &gt;&gt; Amen. This night is vague. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Is it 8:00 PM? &gt;&gt; Is it at 8:30? &gt;&gt; Is it at 9? &gt;&gt; Is it at 10? Is it at 11? Is it at 11:45? &gt;&gt; He say when &gt;&gt; what time? &gt;&gt; He gave only night, but he doesn't want to give the precision &gt;&gt; of the Exodus. Because if he says a 9:00, all of you remove shoes. H &gt;&gt; some of you begin to dance. &gt;&gt; You are dancing. You say, "No, no, it's not 9:00. Let's play outside." You is it 9:20? Then you begin to say, "Huh, I know my people. &gt;&gt; I'm not going to give them the exact time &gt;&gt; so that they can always be on the look. &gt;&gt; Are we together?" &gt;&gt; Amen. Verse 12, for I will pass through the land when &gt;&gt; this night. &gt;&gt; And I will smite all the firstborn of the land of Egypt, both man and water &gt;&gt; and beast. &gt;&gt; And against all the gods of Egypt, I will execute what? &gt;&gt; Judgment. &gt;&gt; Because I am what? &gt;&gt; I am the Lord. &gt;&gt; Job 2 verse 29. I'm skip speaking. I mean skipping this. And it came to pass that a what? &gt;&gt; Midnight. &gt;&gt; Now we know the time. Yes. &gt;&gt; He didn't say what what he says at which night. &gt;&gt; Midnight. &gt;&gt; At first he say at night, &gt;&gt; but in his mind God had midnight. &gt;&gt; So Israel didn't know it's coming at midnight. &gt;&gt; Israel maybe thought by 8:30 we are gone. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; God didn't want to tell them anything. But a midnight &gt;&gt; midnight &gt;&gt; when God is coming, your shoes on your feet, &gt;&gt; your loins are ged, &gt;&gt; your stuff are in the hand. In other words, when God look at you ready to go, when he look at you ready to go, when you look at you ready to go, but there's still a time there &gt;&gt; that God is not there yet. &gt;&gt; So you are living ready. &gt;&gt; You are still living in Egypt, but you are ready. I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; Verse 29. And it came to pass that at what time? &gt;&gt; Midnight. &gt;&gt; Now we know 12 p.m. You know the midnight cry.

Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother, they don't even give us a chance to wait in the morning and night. &gt;&gt; Lord, you told us to be ready to leave at midnight. &gt;&gt; So, some are waking up the baby that were already sleeping with their shoes.

Let's go, my friend. &gt;&gt; And the children of Israel, &gt;&gt; all of this is happening at what time? &gt;&gt; Midnight. Do you see sun and midnight? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; What is in midnight? &gt;&gt; And what is outside in Egypt? What do you hear? &gt;&gt; People are crying. Is that a good time? &gt;&gt; It's a funeral time everywhere. &gt;&gt; But even though it's a funeral for you, it's a departure. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; And not only a departure, let's see verse 35. Amen. &gt;&gt; Verse 35 say, "And the children of Israel did what?" &gt;&gt; According to the word of Moses. &gt;&gt; According to the word of who? &gt;&gt; Moses. &gt;&gt; And Moses got that word from who? &gt;&gt; God. &gt;&gt; So let's see. What did Moses tell the children of Israel? According to the word of Moses, come out and did what? &gt;&gt; They borrowed of the Egyptians. &gt;&gt; What? &gt;&gt; Jewels of silver. &gt;&gt; They borrowed of the Egyptian. &gt;&gt; Let's go slowly. &gt;&gt; Let's go slowly. Were they coming back? &gt;&gt; No sir. &gt;&gt; Were they coming back? &gt;&gt; The Bible say they did what? &gt;&gt; If you look at the correct translation, &gt;&gt; it means they ask. &gt;&gt; They didn't borrow. They ask because borrow you need to return. The correct translation say they ask. &gt;&gt; They ask who? &gt;&gt; Let's read my friend. And they verse 35. And they borrow or they ask of the water. &gt;&gt; Egyptians jewels of silver. &gt;&gt; They ask them what &gt;&gt; jewels of silver. &gt;&gt; Please read loud. &gt;&gt; Some some don't want to hear those stuff. Just read them. &gt;&gt; They bought and they bought &gt;&gt; someone they they ask for Bible. They ask for tapes. That's what you want. Uh &gt;&gt; have I said something wrong? I'm reading the Bible. We are We are answering great substance. &gt;&gt; We are answering what? &gt;&gt; Some of you you ask for prayer. &gt;&gt; We need to know what they ask. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Every minute you taking, you will pay it back &gt;&gt; with interest. But since I'm a Christian, I won't put you in. &gt;&gt; Let's go, my friend. &gt;&gt; And they barred of the Egyptians. &gt;&gt; They ask what? &gt;&gt; Of the Egyptians. Jewels of silver. &gt;&gt; Jewel of what? &gt;&gt; Silver. &gt;&gt; What are they going to do with silver? &gt;&gt; Why? Why? What are they going to do for silver? &gt;&gt; Because it ah let me let me now nail it. &gt;&gt; This was not them. It's Moses that command them. &gt;&gt; It was Moses that told them at this time when everything is dark, &gt;&gt; go to the Egyptian, ask them this and this and this. &gt;&gt; The spiritual Moses. &gt;&gt; The spiritual Moses say, "Ask what? &gt;&gt; Silver and water." &gt;&gt; And jewels of gold &gt;&gt; and jewels of gold and what? &gt;&gt; And Raymond. are no message believers. So I have to be protected. &gt;&gt; So when you come fight with the word &gt;&gt; Jews of gold and what &gt;&gt; and then what &gt;&gt; do you know what remnant mean? &gt;&gt; It means what? &gt;&gt; So in your Exodus you asking for what? [Applause] &gt;&gt; Can you answer me?

Yes sir. &gt;&gt; In other words, there was a special anointing &gt;&gt; that came in the midst of chaos. &gt;&gt; When it came in the world for the bride, it was not chaos. &gt;&gt; It was a time for Jew &gt;&gt; of silver of gold and remnant. &gt;&gt; Let me ask you for let me ask you, did they pay for it? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Did they work for it? &gt;&gt; No sir. &gt;&gt; Did they went to school for it? &gt;&gt; No sir. They are getting by asking. &gt;&gt; Let me ask. &gt;&gt; Let me let me ask you let me ask you a question. &gt;&gt; Let me ask you a question. &gt;&gt; What prove to you? What prove to you that if you ask they will give it to you? &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; So it must be done by what? &gt;&gt; By what? &gt;&gt; So Moses turned them into a faith. &gt;&gt; In other words, when you go to In other words, when you go to the Eg, &gt;&gt; you don't say please Mr. Egyptian. No, you say sir, &gt;&gt; I need this. I need this. I need this. I need this. Put them on my luggage quickly. I'm leaving.

Amen. &gt;&gt; This is a commandment of Moses. &gt;&gt; In all the word, Moses based that by the word. &gt;&gt; He had a scripture backup. &gt;&gt; Because God already promised to Abraham. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Did you work for it? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; So maybe during that time, father, I don't know if I will even preach. Maybe during that time, &gt;&gt; amen, &gt;&gt; you are going into the store and you keep watching, &gt;&gt; you say, "Ah, Lord, the day I will afford to get that dress, &gt;&gt; but I don't have money to get that dress." God knew &gt;&gt; that there will come a time when you don't need money, but you will get the dress. &gt;&gt; You don't need a bank account, but God will come. You don't need to have money. You need the word of the prophet. &gt;&gt; You need the word. Man shall not live by bread alone. Every word what the prophet say is enough. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Can I say something? &gt;&gt; Can I say something? You know that the tabernacle was built in the wilderness. &gt;&gt; Exactly. &gt;&gt; So which material did they use? [Applause] &gt;&gt; Which material did they use? &gt;&gt; Which material did they use? &gt;&gt; So God is not looking at you. &gt;&gt; He's blessing you for his purpose. &gt;&gt; You who are humble. You who are humble, they were giving you the juice because God knew he will need it over there for the tabernacle. [Music] [Applause] useful. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Get a nice job. No, I'm okay with the way I am. &gt;&gt; We need to build the tabernacle. &gt;&gt; Me, I'm going to ask God to bless you &gt;&gt; and to lock that money to go to the tabernacle &gt;&gt; because you don't need it, but the tabernacle need it. [Applause] Are we together, brother Tony? &gt;&gt; H. Brother Tony, say amen. Where are we at, my friend? &gt;&gt; We on verse 36. &gt;&gt; Verse 36. And we will finish sooner, my friend. &gt;&gt; If you do good, we finish and we start read. I have not started reading Baram. Let's go. Verse 36. And the Lord God did what? gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians. &gt;&gt; So the word of Moses was accompanied by what? &gt;&gt; Favor. &gt;&gt; A divine anointing of favor. &gt;&gt; In other word, whenever you accept what Moses said, &gt;&gt; a favor come on you. &gt;&gt; Are we together? The Bible say, "And the Lord gave the people what? &gt;&gt; Favor in the in the sight of the Egyptians &gt;&gt; so that they did what? &gt;&gt; Lent unto themselves." &gt;&gt; In other words, they gave them what? &gt;&gt; Such things as they required. &gt;&gt; They gave them what? &gt;&gt; The silver. &gt;&gt; They gave them what? &gt;&gt; Silver. So whatever was coming in the mouth &gt;&gt; of the Israel, &gt;&gt; if Israel speak something, &gt;&gt; the Egyptian give it. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; All you have to do is speak. &gt;&gt; When you get to somebody, you say, "I need that." And you don't have to even think what the answer will be because there is a favor of the Lord. There is an anointing of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Are we together? In the midst of trouble, in the midst of darkness, and midnight when we were uncomfortable, when they woke me up to move on, there is an anointing in the time &gt;&gt; for me to get what I needed. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together in the back? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? Yes. &gt;&gt; The Bible say, "And the Lord gave the people favor in the sight of what?" &gt;&gt; The Egyptians &gt;&gt; so that they lent them such things as the water &gt;&gt; required. &gt;&gt; And the Lord did what? &gt;&gt; Spoiled the Egyptians. &gt;&gt; Do you know what Paul mean? &gt;&gt; Took away. &gt;&gt; The Bible say, "Who did it?" &gt;&gt; The Lord. &gt;&gt; Who did it? &gt;&gt; The Lord. &gt;&gt; But who actually was doing it? &gt;&gt; If you look in your eyes, who was doing that? &gt;&gt; But truly, who was doing that? To you it is brother Charles. &gt;&gt; But when God look it say it's not brother Charles. &gt;&gt; I am the one spawning Egypt. [Applause] &gt;&gt; I'm removing things from Egypt. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Job to verse 39. My friendes. &gt;&gt; Job to verse 39. &gt;&gt; And they did what? baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they've brought forth out of Egypt. &gt;&gt; And it was not because for it was not &gt;&gt; it was not leavened &gt;&gt; because they were how &gt;&gt; thrust out of Egypt &gt;&gt; and could not tell neither they they neither had they don't done done what &gt;&gt; prepared for themselves any victory. &gt;&gt; In other words, God pushed them in the time that they didn't have time to even pack stuff, &gt;&gt; pack food. And God made it so they push them like that &gt;&gt; so that God will now teach them in the wilderness. Remember yesterday &gt;&gt; to live by faith, &gt;&gt; not by what you pack. &gt;&gt; No. Now you are living by faith. &gt;&gt; If you need quail, you don't need no restaurant. &gt;&gt; You don't need McDonald. &gt;&gt; Just speak the word. The quail must come. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. Mother will come &gt;&gt; not from human being. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A hidden season &gt;&gt; in darkness &gt;&gt; to you. What is going on in Egypt? So and so I pass away. So and so are going to the funeral. Over there also there is a c. But I'm telling you all over the world it's a mess. Everybody's losing somebody. &gt;&gt; Check that season very well. Check that season very well. &gt;&gt; When death is on the land, when the pale horse is riding, &gt;&gt; when death is riding all over, be careful. There is something there &gt;&gt; before the exodus &gt;&gt; before the living of Egypt. Before the living of the world, the last anointing is the pale horse. &gt;&gt; Watch out what is there. [Music] &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's go to our last scripture. Isaiah 60. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let's go to our last scripture. &gt;&gt; Uh-uh. &gt;&gt; You took already 36 minutes of reading the Bible. &gt;&gt; We clear? &gt;&gt; We clear. &gt;&gt; Are we clear? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's church.

Brother Brandham says that in the message water shalom &gt;&gt; he say gross darkness where &gt;&gt; upon the people &gt;&gt; of discourse. This is a what &gt;&gt; a prophesying of the &gt;&gt; of the day that we are what &gt;&gt; living now. &gt;&gt; In other words, the day you are living now &gt;&gt; is gross darkness. &gt;&gt; But remember your light has come. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. We are looking at the picture of this darkness first. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Okay. Let's look at this darkness because that's where we are more professional. &gt;&gt; That is where we are.

Let's keep climbing. &gt;&gt; He says that and where we would not think that would be happening in the time of what? &gt;&gt; Modern civilization. &gt;&gt; In other words, all this killing should not be even part of the civilization. &gt;&gt; After all the education we have, after all the technology, we should not be seeing all shooting like this. Are we together? &gt;&gt; But we sure have it &gt;&gt; because of what? &gt;&gt; Gross darkness is upon the people. &gt;&gt; In other words, what you see going on is a reflection of gross darkness. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Please follow me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I won't let you go. You need to do it today. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. He says now those who will not turn to &gt;&gt; light &gt;&gt; then there is only one thing that I can say for the coming year you are going to stop how &gt;&gt; darker &gt;&gt; and darker as the year goes on &gt;&gt; in other words don't expect things to get better &gt;&gt; I know when I say that you are trembling &gt;&gt; hold on my friend keep your seat belt we just started &gt;&gt; amen Brother say, have you noticed &gt;&gt; in the last water &gt;&gt; few years &gt;&gt; some of you men and women around my age that how each year it seems like the what &gt;&gt; darkness comes more and more. I was speaking the other day and I say to my wife, &gt;&gt; Sister Cheron, you know, it seems like that as the ear do what &gt;&gt; goes on &gt;&gt; and it just seem like the people begin to get water &gt;&gt; further and further away from the real thing &gt;&gt; that they should be coming out &gt;&gt; closer and closer to &gt;&gt; it looks like people hate God. &gt;&gt; It looks like people &gt;&gt; uh the the the the what the atheist begin to get more covert &gt;&gt; than the Christian. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; We are painting that picture first. My friend, brother Brandham say, I have noticed among men, look out where &gt;&gt; on the streets &gt;&gt; and most among women, what they desire and what they like to do. And they are changing what? &gt;&gt; Attitudes all the time. &gt;&gt; Men are becoming like what? &gt;&gt; Women. &gt;&gt; Should I tell you anything? go to Walmart &gt;&gt; and then women are becoming more like what &gt;&gt; men. &gt;&gt; It seems like there is no way to stop it.

Amen. &gt;&gt; He says, "And it's them people want to do what &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; but then there is something about it that won't let them water &gt;&gt; do right." &gt;&gt; In other words, they want to do right. [Music] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham say, but there is something &gt;&gt; that is blocking them &gt;&gt; from doing right. &gt;&gt; What is it? &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham say it just what &gt;&gt; presses down on them. &gt;&gt; What? &gt;&gt; Forces them. In either way, they don't know what they're doing. &gt;&gt; If you sit down, they don't want to do it. &gt;&gt; Tomorrow, they find themselves doing it. &gt;&gt; Tattoo everywhere. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He says it's like a what? &gt;&gt; A heavy dark fog over the whole earth. &gt;&gt; Uh-huh.

They did what? &gt;&gt; Reject Christ. &gt;&gt; Of every age that was mentioned in the Bible. &gt;&gt; The loud was what? &gt;&gt; The worst of all of them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Of all the ages in the Bible. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Now, this is what &gt;&gt; the worst. &gt;&gt; He turned him out and did what? &gt;&gt; Rejected him. &gt;&gt; Put him where? &gt;&gt; On the outside. &gt;&gt; I'm getting my friend. &gt;&gt; Does God change his mind? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; You know the answer right now? Now I claim that he is alive when &gt;&gt; today. &gt;&gt; How? &gt;&gt; And his spirit &gt;&gt; after the church ages. We are &gt;&gt; in the Leodysian church age. &gt;&gt; Which call? &gt;&gt; The last call. &gt;&gt; And the what? &gt;&gt; The worst of all of them. &gt;&gt; Because he was put out where &gt;&gt; of the church. &gt;&gt; So now we understand we are in the worst place. &gt;&gt; The worst of all. &gt;&gt; The worst one sees the flood. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And then we speak about the seventh seal. &gt;&gt; No, no, no, no. Okay. Let's let's look at the seven seal. Okay. Let's look at the seven because we talk about the seven seal. The seven seal. Let me look at the seven seal. The Bible say brother say in the message the feast of the trumpet. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; He said now the losing of what &gt;&gt; this is ecclesiastical spirit. &gt;&gt; Ecclesiastical water. &gt;&gt; Spirit. &gt;&gt; Do you know what ecclesiastical spirit was? It's a demonic religious spirit. &gt;&gt; And brother Brandham say this demonic religious spirit &gt;&gt; has been turned loose. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Not the spirit of God. &gt;&gt; We're talking about a religious demonic spirit. &gt;&gt; The devil has been turned loose. &gt;&gt; Do you understand? Where &gt;&gt; are we together? &gt;&gt; He says now how many years? 20 years later &gt;&gt; after what &gt;&gt; that war &gt;&gt; you can see it's in 44 because that is 64 the the second world war or something he says we see the what &gt;&gt; loosing of the ecclesiastical &gt;&gt; in other words the ecclesiastical spirit was bound &gt;&gt; it was control &gt;&gt; do you follow me &gt;&gt; do you follow me &gt;&gt; we talking about the bad one and we brag about the seven seal now let's look at that seven seal that we brag &gt;&gt; that seven seal that we brought, brother Brandham say that the most demonic spirit. &gt;&gt; That's what I'm explaining. The bad one was blocked, was tied, &gt;&gt; was put in prison, &gt;&gt; but that spirit has been liberated, &gt;&gt; has been free, has been loose. &gt;&gt; We need to know what lose that spirit. &gt;&gt; Are we together? If you tired, I stop right here. &gt;&gt; Who lose that spirit? Brother Brandham say we see the what? &gt;&gt; The loosing of the ecclesiastical spirit. &gt;&gt; What? And &gt;&gt; the seventh seal. &gt;&gt; And the what? &gt;&gt; The seventh seal. &gt;&gt; Hey, hey, hey. &gt;&gt; The seventh seal. I thought the seventh seal is the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; Keep your seat belt. I thought when the seventh seal open and the full word of God and then the seals are broken and then I thought about all of that. But today, brother Brham is saying that the the the the demonic religious spirit &gt;&gt; was loose where seal. &gt;&gt; So when they were breaking the seven seal, &gt;&gt; do you follow? &gt;&gt; Please can you can you read with me? Is that a problem? &gt;&gt; So when they were opening the seven seal &gt;&gt; because if the book was closed, we are lost. &gt;&gt; And John was so happy because one was found. &gt;&gt; Oh, to open the book and to lose the seal. Oh, and all heaven rejoice and heaven was rejoicing. John was jumping. But when they broke the seal, &gt;&gt; a demonic spirit came out. [Applause] In other word, the seventh seal peritted the losing. &gt;&gt; In other words, when the seven sin is opening, &gt;&gt; the seven se hey &gt;&gt; call me the devil. &gt;&gt; Me and you, let's go. [Applause] You need to you you have to swallow this. I have to push it. You have to swallow this. I'm not going nowhere. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In other word, when the because we said the seven seat is Christ. &gt;&gt; It's Christ. &gt;&gt; We know that, right? &gt;&gt; But when they open up, &gt;&gt; when they open up, &gt;&gt; Amen. They didn't just open God. &gt;&gt; They also opened the devil. &gt;&gt; I hope you are following me. &gt;&gt; So, Laia got anointing permission &gt;&gt; from the sery &gt;&gt; to anoint the devil to come right here. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; A season, a season where hidden where? [Music] &gt;&gt; The seventh seal. The seal of all the ages. &gt;&gt; The angel that was doing like this. &gt;&gt; Hey, when that angel come, &gt;&gt; we look at Sabino. But there is another side. &gt;&gt; When we were looking at Sabino, the devil also came down. [Applause] that God lose the devil. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hell &gt;&gt; came where Abraham was. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; Please follow me. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He says the losing of the ecclesiastical spirit and the what? &gt;&gt; The seventh seal. How can a bad demonic spirit come under the seventh seal? &gt;&gt; Ah the seventh seal the what? &gt;&gt; The seventh trumpet to the Jew. &gt;&gt; Look at the moon which is the church &gt;&gt; doing what? &gt;&gt; Darkening out. &gt;&gt; Where? &gt;&gt; See it's drawn out the son of man being what? &gt;&gt; Drawn from the church. So the reason why they are they are they are kicking Jesus out of the church because the seven seal brought the spirit down &gt;&gt; and it's darkening all the churches. [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; That's why the Pentecost can help it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; H brother Stephen. &gt;&gt; So this is dangerous. The seven still lost lose the devil on us. &gt;&gt; Laia the worst age. &gt;&gt; The gross darkness in Laia. &gt;&gt; And out of all these ages, God chose me and you &gt;&gt; to put us right there. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] What is really going on? &gt;&gt; Brother Glenn, &gt;&gt; watch this my friend. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham say but you but when you have become a what? &gt;&gt; A real Christian. &gt;&gt; Not a Christian. A what? &gt;&gt; A real Christian. &gt;&gt; Every moment you are what? &gt;&gt; Wondering &gt;&gt; am I pleasing the Lord? &gt;&gt; If I could hear from him, &gt;&gt; he put you how? on tension &gt;&gt; put you how &gt;&gt; on guard. &gt;&gt; That is what makes you what you are. &gt;&gt; That tension is a blessing. &gt;&gt; That tension of did I do something wrong today? Have I done something wrong today? It's a blessing. &gt;&gt; It put you on God &gt;&gt; because you must have your foot, &gt;&gt; your your shoes on your feet, &gt;&gt; your belt right there. &gt;&gt; So you got to be on your God. Are we together? &gt;&gt; He says that is what makes you what? &gt;&gt; So after all tension is what? &gt;&gt; A blessing. &gt;&gt; Some of you won't say amen. &gt;&gt; But tension is what? &gt;&gt; It's just the way you are looking at. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Tension is a bad thing. Brother say tension is what? &gt;&gt; Blessing &gt;&gt; depending on what? &gt;&gt; The way you're looking at it. &gt;&gt; Do you follow me? &gt;&gt; Do you follow me? &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham say it's just the way you are what &gt;&gt; looking at it. &gt;&gt; It's just the way you are what &gt;&gt; looking at it. &gt;&gt; See if you just look to If you just look the other side, &gt;&gt; there is &gt;&gt; follow me now. No matter, &gt;&gt; brother Glenn. &gt;&gt; No matter how thin you slice what &gt;&gt; anything, &gt;&gt; you still got what? &gt;&gt; Two sides to it. &gt;&gt; So you want to see what? &gt;&gt; Both sides. &gt;&gt; Let me repeat it again. Brother is saying no matter how you take something &gt;&gt; even if it's feeding like this if you can slice this in two &gt;&gt; just know that how many side do you have &gt;&gt; and brother say don't always look in one side [Music] &gt;&gt; always look at what &gt;&gt; do you follow do you understand me &gt;&gt; and we have just seen how this is bad Amen. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Gross darkness &gt;&gt; upon the people &gt;&gt; the one of &gt;&gt; the seven losing the ecclesiastical. &gt;&gt; We need to look at both side. [Applause] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; That was one side. &gt;&gt; We need to look at what &gt;&gt; let's flip the other side. Because God chose you to be there. &gt;&gt; How can God take you and put you in the worstage &gt;&gt; of all the ages? &gt;&gt; Depression pills going on and God take you and put you there and sh you there &gt;&gt; and God take the devil and turn him loose. Amen. &gt;&gt; What is in this for you? &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. And if God put you in La, who are you? [Applause] &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Who wrote first Corinthian? &gt;&gt; Who wrote 1 Corinthian? &gt;&gt; Paul. &gt;&gt; Second Corinthian. &gt;&gt; Timothy 1. &gt;&gt; Timothy 2. &gt;&gt; Uh uh uh Roman &gt;&gt; uh uh uh uh Philippian. &gt;&gt; Who did that? &gt;&gt; When God took Paul. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you do you follow me? &gt;&gt; And put sister le. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Paul look at Paul. &gt;&gt; He looked the age of Ephesus full of light. full of darkness. God say le Paul le Paul Paul go where the light is. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Have I said something wrong? &gt;&gt; But this girl right here &gt;&gt; that cannot preach the gospel &gt;&gt; in the major prophet in Ephesus. Who are you? [Applause] I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; Paul say if an angel come down &gt;&gt; and preach differently than what I preach, &gt;&gt; let the angel be watched. &gt;&gt; But God say you are not fit for &gt;&gt; you need to be in Ephesia. I have a hand peek. &gt;&gt; I have a selected group. I have an elite, &gt;&gt; a Navy Seal, a four special forces that are put in Laisha. They know what to do in Laisha. They are built for Laisha. &gt;&gt; Can I continue, my friend? Can I continue my friend? Can I continue my friend? Let's look at this on the other side &gt;&gt; because we found out that simultaneously when darkness come light also come. &gt;&gt; It looks like your light that come &gt;&gt; cannot function without darkness. [Applause] &gt;&gt; You didn't get me well. [Applause] Arise and shine &gt;&gt; for thy light has come. &gt;&gt; But for your light to be working, &gt;&gt; we must put not darkness, gross darkness. [Applause] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. You must put gross darkness. When God is opening the seventh seal, &gt;&gt; he say ah this is too powerful called the devil himself. &gt;&gt; Get there &gt;&gt; because this seal need to be matched by the devil himself. [Applause] Amen. [Laughter] &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Can we look on the other side? &gt;&gt; Oh, you want to go home? &gt;&gt; Let's look at the other side. &gt;&gt; Follow me, my friend. &gt;&gt; Today, what is still loading there? It's a lot. &gt;&gt; Let's go. In first John, what &gt;&gt; five? Are we together? &gt;&gt; The Bible say this is then what? &gt;&gt; The message. &gt;&gt; This is what &gt;&gt; the message. &gt;&gt; The message which we have what? &gt;&gt; And declare unto you that God is what? &gt;&gt; Light. &gt;&gt; God is what? &gt;&gt; Light. &gt;&gt; And what? &gt;&gt; In him. &gt;&gt; Follow me. Where? &gt;&gt; In him. &gt;&gt; In God there is no what? &gt;&gt; Darkness at all. So what the Bible is saying here, &gt;&gt; if you got God &gt;&gt; in God 100%. &gt;&gt; Is what? &gt;&gt; So if you want to find darkness, &gt;&gt; you will never find darkness inside of God. &gt;&gt; Are we clear? &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Because God is what? &gt;&gt; Good. The Bible says in Revelation 21, "And the city has no need of water, &gt;&gt; the sun &gt;&gt; in the city where the lamb is ah neither of water, &gt;&gt; the moon &gt;&gt; to water &gt;&gt; to shine in it." &gt;&gt; For the glory of God did what? &gt;&gt; Lighten it. &gt;&gt; And the lamb is what? &gt;&gt; The light thereof. &gt;&gt; So the light is a person. [Music] &gt;&gt; I'm going slowly, my friend. &gt;&gt; We are in a we are looking at the other side. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Another scripture that goes to 1 Timothy 6. The Bible say our Lord Jesus Christ I'm saving time which in his time he shall do what? &gt;&gt; Show &gt;&gt; Jesus who is what? &gt;&gt; The blessed &gt;&gt; and the water &gt;&gt; and only potentiate &gt;&gt; and who? &gt;&gt; The king of James, &gt;&gt; King of King and what &gt;&gt; the Lord of lords &gt;&gt; who only has what? &gt;&gt; Immortality &gt;&gt; dwelling where? &gt;&gt; In the light &gt;&gt; which no man can what &gt;&gt; approach. For God dwell where? &gt;&gt; In the life. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; According to Psalm 104 verse 1 and two. Bless the Lord water. &gt;&gt; Oh my soul. &gt;&gt; Oh Lord my God. Thou how? &gt;&gt; Very great. &gt;&gt; Thou are what? &gt;&gt; Clothes with honor and majesty. &gt;&gt; Who covered thyself with what? &gt;&gt; Light. &gt;&gt; As a what? &gt;&gt; With a garment. &gt;&gt; So inside the light there is God. That's why when the light appeared to Apostle Paul, &gt;&gt; the light say I am Jesus. &gt;&gt; Jesus was in the light. &gt;&gt; I came from God. I'm going back to God. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So God is light. &gt;&gt; In God there is what? &gt;&gt; Let's look at David. &gt;&gt; David got an anointing again. David. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Okay. Okay. David, prophesy. Prophesy. Tell us what God is saying because you just told us God cover himself with light. We say amen. David, what else do you have? Hallelujah. Hallelujah. David, tell us. Tell us. Tell us. David under the anointing. &gt;&gt; Psalm 97. The Lord what? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. David, keep going. Let the earth do what? &gt;&gt; Rejoice. &gt;&gt; Keep going, David. Let the multitude of be what? Glad there are &gt;&gt; cloudness and what &gt;&gt; and darkness &gt;&gt; around about who? &gt;&gt; Push the brake. [Music] &gt;&gt; Verify on your Bible. [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; Verify in your Bible. &gt;&gt; David. Hey, David. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. &gt;&gt; Wait a minute. David, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Slow down. Turn the car off. Come out from the car. Remove the the key. Remove the key. Come close the car. What did you say? &gt;&gt; I have a question. If a light is shining here, do you see darkness? &gt;&gt; But David is saying something. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. David say the Lord does what? &gt;&gt; Rain. &gt;&gt; And he say what? &gt;&gt; Clouds. &gt;&gt; Clouds. We love cloud. That's very good. &gt;&gt; Pillar of cloud. Oh, good. &gt;&gt; Cloud and what? &gt;&gt; Darkness. are what? &gt;&gt; Round about him. &gt;&gt; So if you look around God, what do you see? &gt;&gt; Clouds and darkness. &gt;&gt; And who is in the midst of darkness? Are we go? Let me continue. He says righteousness and what? &gt;&gt; Judgment &gt;&gt; are the habitation of what? &gt;&gt; His throne. &gt;&gt; So God sitting on his throne. When David look, what does he see? Because God is light. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God is what? &gt;&gt; But David say around God, what do you see? So if you see darkness, who is in the midst? &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; How can God tolerate? &gt;&gt; Please. Please. How can God tolerate &gt;&gt; the darkness &gt;&gt; where you &gt;&gt; because this is this can confuse me? &gt;&gt; You know you you know what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; You know what I'm saying? You know what I mean? &gt;&gt; Huh? You see what I'm saying? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Because this is not right. I will look at darkness and I say, "Okay, darkness is there. I'm going to run away from it." But didn't he know that behind the darkness &gt;&gt; God is there? &gt;&gt; Why didn't the light of God just &gt;&gt; remove darkness? because you're the one that started with this prophecy. &gt;&gt; We need to understand it better. &gt;&gt; Brother David is answering. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; You begin to get wor down. &gt;&gt; David say if I say &gt;&gt; surely the darkness shall do what? &gt;&gt; Cover me. &gt;&gt; Even the night shall be what? &gt;&gt; Light about me. &gt;&gt; I'm looking at the other side. David say if I take darkness &gt;&gt; and I put around me &gt;&gt; sir &gt;&gt; if you look at me you will see around me &gt;&gt; it's like &gt;&gt; it's what &gt;&gt; if I say not even the night shall be light what &gt;&gt; about me &gt;&gt; no the night shall be what &gt;&gt; light about me &gt;&gt; let's let's let's understand clear &gt;&gt; David is saying &gt;&gt; if I take darkness &gt;&gt; huh and I bring darkness And I begin to cover brotherh Tony with darkness. &gt;&gt; David is saying when you when darkness come where I am. &gt;&gt; If you look at that darkness that darkness will be like what? &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; You didn't get me. &gt;&gt; You getting tired. flight attendant. &gt;&gt; No, because you're getting tired. Because you're getting tired. Let let me start again. David is saying &gt;&gt; that if you bring darkness, &gt;&gt; if the devil say David is happy, darkness, darkness like an ice cream, &gt;&gt; who is it? &gt;&gt; Sister Divine. M &gt;&gt; David is sitting he say if you bring darkness &gt;&gt; do you know what you're doing &gt;&gt; when even the night &gt;&gt; shall be light about what &gt;&gt; in other because when you bring darkness the atmosphere of David will change &gt;&gt; from a light to a night &gt;&gt; from a day to a night &gt;&gt; and David say when you bringing night around me &gt;&gt; your night will be changed. into a what? &gt;&gt; Into a light. &gt;&gt; So what is in David? &gt;&gt; Arise and shine. &gt;&gt; Arise and who? &gt;&gt; Who's going to shine? &gt;&gt; So what is in you? &gt;&gt; So if you are light, &gt;&gt; if they bring darkness around you, &gt;&gt; what happened to the darkness that are coming on you? &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. The devil don't want you to catch it. But I'm going to start it again. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; The Bible say arise and what? &gt;&gt; So if you shining, who are you? &gt;&gt; In plain word, you are a light bulb. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; If you if if if you turn a light bulb and you bring that darkness and you begin to put around the light bulb, what happened to the light bulb? &gt;&gt; Does he change? &gt;&gt; No. Does what? What will the light of the light bulb do to the darkness? &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; And David is saying even if I cover myself with darkness, &gt;&gt; all the darkness will turn into what? &gt;&gt; Because the light of God will take care of the darkness. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? So according to David, whether there is darkness on wrath, &gt;&gt; it's the same. &gt;&gt; You didn't get it yet. &gt;&gt; According to David, if there is no darkness, &gt;&gt; it's day. &gt;&gt; And David is saying, if you bring darkness, &gt;&gt; it's still day. &gt;&gt; Why? Because in David there is a light. That's why David say even though I walk &gt;&gt; in the shadow &gt;&gt; in the valley of the shadow of death. If it's a shadow brother say because there is light that's why you must have a shadow. [Music] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; You didn't get David be good but you going to get him now. The Bible say David say yeah the darkness does what? not from thee &gt;&gt; from God. &gt;&gt; He says, "But the night does what? &gt;&gt; Shineth as the day." &gt;&gt; So darkness before God turn into what? &gt;&gt; Day. &gt;&gt; And David say darkness &gt;&gt; and what? &gt;&gt; Light. &gt;&gt; Are what? &gt;&gt; Both are like to thee. &gt;&gt; I hope you understanding. &gt;&gt; David is saying if you bring God light, &gt;&gt; you say what is it? God say it's light. Yes. &gt;&gt; If you flip, you bring darkness. &gt;&gt; God say it's light. &gt;&gt; You didn't get it. &gt;&gt; You didn't get it yet. &gt;&gt; David is saying for God, whether you bring darkness and light, it doesn't make any difference. &gt;&gt; What is the message behind it? &gt;&gt; God is light. around God. We see David saying that it's darkness. &gt;&gt; And David is saying that the darkness that you see around God &gt;&gt; is not an obstacle. &gt;&gt; That's exactly right. &gt;&gt; Flight attendant, prepare for landing. &gt;&gt; David is saying even though you see darkness &gt;&gt; around God, &gt;&gt; that darkness have zero effect. on God. &gt;&gt; Because God is light. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; In other words, the darkness around God is not an obstacle. &gt;&gt; It's not a hindrance. &gt;&gt; Because God when he look at darkness, he sees the day. &gt;&gt; And God is saying you arise &gt;&gt; and you shine. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because your light has come. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; If you shining, you are light. &gt;&gt; But around you is the darkness of this. &gt;&gt; But don't let that darkness become a hindrance. &gt;&gt; Because darkness is nothing for you. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. I hope we are together. I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; You didn't get it, my friend. &gt;&gt; When they shooting people, &gt;&gt; it brings fear. &gt;&gt; Which world is going on like this? &gt;&gt; What is going on in this world? &gt;&gt; Shooting, shooting, shooting, shooting, shooting, shooting. By the brand, say it's darkness. &gt;&gt; But you are light. &gt;&gt; And light turned darkness in light. In other words, whatever is going on around God, God doesn't care. &gt;&gt; Because God passes the darkness and he sees the darkness as no hindrance. &gt;&gt; So don't let hinder you from your season in Laisha. [Applause] There is a reason why God put you in Laisha. &gt;&gt; God knows who you are &gt;&gt; and knew what is in you &gt;&gt; and what is in you qualify for laisha. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; But this is bad. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now this is dark. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Gross darkness. But in the midst of God's darkness, God say, "Arise, &gt;&gt; arise &gt;&gt; and shine." &gt;&gt; Why? Because thy light have come. &gt;&gt; Oh, my light has come and the glory of the Lord has risen upon thee. But there are gross darkness around you. &gt;&gt; In other words, you are reflecting the throne of God. &gt;&gt; God around him is darkness, but the light is in him. In other words, the throne of God is now in you. [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together now. &gt;&gt; That's why brother Brandham said the throne of God, the third throne is in a man &gt;&gt; because the light is in you. &gt;&gt; Darkness must be around you &gt;&gt; to vindicate the light. [Applause] [Music] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Brother Robert, &gt;&gt; if you take this light, you bring it outside, what is he going to do? &gt;&gt; Because there is light over there. &gt;&gt; This light to be effective, you need what? &gt;&gt; So for you to be effective. [Applause] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together for the work. You didn't get me. &gt;&gt; You didn't get me well. &gt;&gt; You didn't get me. Well, &gt;&gt; if there is light all over you, &gt;&gt; people will not know who you are. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; For people to know that you are the light, you must put darkness. &gt;&gt; But your light doesn't require darkness. &gt;&gt; It require gross darkness &gt;&gt; because your intensity is powerful. [Applause] I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. Let me go to the airport. I can't catch this. &gt;&gt; I'm going to skip something. &gt;&gt; What are you trying to say? &gt;&gt; No matter what darkness is around you. &gt;&gt; That's why the devil don't understand. &gt;&gt; The devil keep bringing darkness on you. But you still survive &gt;&gt; because in you there is light. Amen. &gt;&gt; We looking at the other side. &gt;&gt; Back up. I'm heading to the airport. Okay. Flight attendant. Let's prepare for landing. Brother say, I'm happy to know this one thing. &gt;&gt; If you tired, I got to stop. &gt;&gt; I'm happy to know what &gt;&gt; what do you what do you need to know? &gt;&gt; Brother say friend that Christianity has no negative &gt;&gt; nothing to it. [Applause] &gt;&gt; You know what? Let's stop. Let's pick up next Sunday. &gt;&gt; So, so, so, so this will soak when you are fresh. &gt;&gt; Because I was trying to drive something here &gt;&gt; then we can let you go. &gt;&gt; Brother say &gt;&gt; you remembered because we showed you how bad our is. Yes. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; And God chose you &gt;&gt; to put you in the bad environment. &gt;&gt; God is not stupid. &gt;&gt; God knows what is in you &gt;&gt; and he prove it by Abraham. &gt;&gt; Are are we together? &gt;&gt; So in order to help you, brother is saying this. Even though you are in a bad environment, &gt;&gt; remember this. &gt;&gt; What do you remember? You remember that Christianity &gt;&gt; has what? &gt;&gt; No negative to it. &gt;&gt; In other word, when you are a Christian, &gt;&gt; there is nothing negative in that. &gt;&gt; I know it's very hard for you to believe &gt;&gt; because darkness is around you. &gt;&gt; But remember, darkness around you is not different than light. &gt;&gt; David said the darkness is the same as the light. Both of them are the same. &gt;&gt; That's why for you everything is positive. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together &gt;&gt; because there is no blockage for you. &gt;&gt; That's why all things in your life. &gt;&gt; Work together for good. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham said that Christianity has what? &gt;&gt; No negative nothing to it. It is everything what? &gt;&gt; Absolutely positive. &gt;&gt; Not positive. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; In other word, what you call darkness &gt;&gt; is positive. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Don't worry. I'm heading to the airport. I'm hitting a wall. You fool. You are overflowing, my friend. Amen. &gt;&gt; David say the light. &gt;&gt; The light. &gt;&gt; Amen. and the darkness &gt;&gt; before God. &gt;&gt; There's no difference. &gt;&gt; We are the one that say this is dark. &gt;&gt; This is light. &gt;&gt; God doesn't care. &gt;&gt; When it's day, God flip to a cloud. &gt;&gt; And God keep walking. &gt;&gt; When it's night, &gt;&gt; God turn on and he's a pillar of fire and God keep walking. &gt;&gt; So whether you change environment, it doesn't do anything for God. [Applause] Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; So if the devil bring darkness in your life, &gt;&gt; don't worry. It's going to turn to light. &gt;&gt; In other words, the more trial that come your way, the brighter you begin to shine. &gt;&gt; Because your light require darkness, &gt;&gt; your positive require negative. That's why you hear brother saying tension is a blessing. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Brother say that Christianity has what? &gt;&gt; No negative nothing to it. &gt;&gt; It's everything what? &gt;&gt; Absolutely positive. &gt;&gt; How many thing in Christianity are positive? &gt;&gt; Everything. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. Light is what? &gt;&gt; Positive. &gt;&gt; Darkness is what? &gt;&gt; Because in you everything is what? &gt;&gt; In other words, it doesn't make a difference whether I go through the green pasture &gt;&gt; or the valley of the shadow of death. &gt;&gt; I got to stop here. I got to stop. I got to stop. That's why Isaiah say &gt;&gt; okay we hold here because you cannot take what is happening &gt;&gt; now you push this whole sermon next Sunday and add a sermon next Sunday let's go to Isaiah 43 and let's finish here because you push the sermon next Sunday yeah they said then are already overflowing Let's go to Isaiah 43. &gt;&gt; They said there are overflowing. You take them to the restaurant, you waste money. Before you know it, to go box to go box to go box to go box. They can't finish a rack, a full rack, brother John, of of ribs. And we bringing a full rack of ribs. &gt;&gt; I'm bringing you back to the earth. That's why I'm saying that. So, I'm bringing you back to the earth. &gt;&gt; Let's go to Isaiah 43. Let's stop here. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Get your to-go box. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Isaiah 43. But now, thus says who? &gt;&gt; The Lord &gt;&gt; that did what? &gt;&gt; Created thee. &gt;&gt; In other words, your creator. Oh, who? &gt;&gt; Jacob. And he that form you, oh who? &gt;&gt; Israel. &gt;&gt; If you notice, he's calling you first Jacob. &gt;&gt; And then he calls you for Abat. &gt;&gt; Israel. &gt;&gt; He's calling you. In other words, he was the God of you when you were Jacob. &gt;&gt; And he's your God when you are Israel. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; He says, "I'm calling you, oh Jacob." In other words, when you were in your old nature, &gt;&gt; I was still the one that created you. And when you become Israel, you become a Christian. I am still your God. I was your God before you got converted. And I'm your God after you are converted. So your entire life is covered. &gt;&gt; Even when you didn't know me, I was still your God. &gt;&gt; Even when you were cheating &gt;&gt; like Jacob, I was your God. &gt;&gt; When you were dancing in the nightclub, when you are telling lies. I was your God. &gt;&gt; Now that you became Christian, I'm your God. &gt;&gt; So God say listen Israel. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; He says but now that who? &gt;&gt; The Lord. &gt;&gt; The Lord that did what? &gt;&gt; Redeemed &gt;&gt; created you. Who? &gt;&gt; Your old nature. And he that form you or who? &gt;&gt; Israel. &gt;&gt; Do what? &gt;&gt; Fear not. &gt;&gt; For I have what? &gt;&gt; Redeemed thee. &gt;&gt; I have what &gt;&gt; called thee by name. And you are what? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Watch how problem is not problem for you. &gt;&gt; Verse two. When you press through the water, &gt;&gt; the waters. &gt;&gt; I will be where? &gt;&gt; With thee. Amen. &gt;&gt; So if God goes with you, &gt;&gt; what is the word? &gt;&gt; When you pass through the waters, I will be where? &gt;&gt; With thee. &gt;&gt; Come on. And through the waters, &gt;&gt; the rivers, &gt;&gt; they shall not do what? &gt;&gt; Overflow thee. &gt;&gt; In other words, the water have no power on you. &gt;&gt; The river has no power on you. &gt;&gt; So next time when you see water, what is there? Nothing. &gt;&gt; When you see a river, what is it? &gt;&gt; When you pass through the river, they shall not do what? &gt;&gt; Overflow to you. &gt;&gt; When you walk &gt;&gt; where? &gt;&gt; Through the fire. &gt;&gt; Fire. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is that a pleasant thing? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; When you walk through the water, &gt;&gt; the fire, &gt;&gt; you shall not be what? &gt;&gt; Burned. &gt;&gt; If the Because what make us scare for the fire &gt;&gt; is the burning. God is saying there there won't be no burning for your fire. So when the devil is bringing fire, what is it? &gt;&gt; What do you do? You walk on it &gt;&gt; to show the devil that I can walk on a fire &gt;&gt; and I cannot get burned &gt;&gt; because either fire or no fire, it's the same thing. &gt;&gt; In other words, God is bringing you to a level &gt;&gt; until the de there is nothing that the devil can intimidate you with. Yes sir. &gt;&gt; He says when you pass through the fire you shall not be what? &gt;&gt; Neither shall the flame do what? &gt;&gt; Kindle upon thee. &gt;&gt; For I am who? &gt;&gt; The Lord thy God. &gt;&gt; The holy one of what? &gt;&gt; Of Israel. &gt;&gt; Your who? &gt;&gt; Thy savior. &gt;&gt; So God is telling you no matter which circumstances you going through &gt;&gt; the one affect you. [Music] As a matter of fact, for Nebuchadnezzar to recognize who you are, you must walk on the fire. &gt;&gt; When you walk on the fire, the Nebuchadnezzar who will realize, these are not human being. &gt;&gt; These are God who have come in the skin of human being. &gt;&gt; For people to believe that you are not for this world, you must go to the lion's den. &gt;&gt; When you come out, they say this is not a human being. That's right. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; Let's pause here. &gt;&gt; Let's stop here. &gt;&gt; Let's pause here. &gt;&gt; We painted you the first picture &gt;&gt; of Laia. How bad it is. &gt;&gt; Now, I was trying to flip the picture. &gt;&gt; We could not get it. &gt;&gt; But you got the point. &gt;&gt; God is in the throne and God is light. &gt;&gt; But around God, &gt;&gt; there's darkness. And David said the darkness that are around him means nothing to him. &gt;&gt; In other words, God is not really focusing on the darkness &gt;&gt; because he is already light. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's stop here. Let's stand because if I continue overflowing. [Applause] Season season &gt;&gt; hidden &gt;&gt; in darkness. &gt;&gt; Oh, there is darkness. There is darkness. Hold on, Abraham. &gt;&gt; Watch the light that is crossing the sacrifice. &gt;&gt; Oh, there is darkness. There is darkness. Egypt, darkness. People are dying all around. Seed of Abraham, &gt;&gt; listen to the instruction of Moses &gt;&gt; and go do what Moses said because the Lord have favored you at midnight. &gt;&gt; God, &gt;&gt; are we together? &gt;&gt; Now, this is dark. The seven seal lose the season. That's fine. I'm going to go back Lord's will healing next Sunday and show you now what is again on the seven semen. Today you are living with the ecclesiastical spirit. But let's come next Sunday, Lord's willing, and see what is under the seven seal. &gt;&gt; But the seven seal cannot operate without the ecclesiastical spirit. &gt;&gt; So that when you look around, you will see darkness. &gt;&gt; But remember, when you see darkness, there got to be a throne somewhere. Amen. &gt;&gt; And somebody must be light &gt;&gt; in the midst of darkness. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And let's see what is in there. &gt;&gt; Let's pray. Heavenly Father, &gt;&gt; Lord, we approaching you humbly this afternoon. Father, thanking you for your grace, your love, your mercy, and for everything you have been doing for us.
