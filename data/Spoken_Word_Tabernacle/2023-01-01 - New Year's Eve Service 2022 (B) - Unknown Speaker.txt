in this year everybody okay brother Robert I will keep moving if not we will have only the communion without the foot washing but let's see how it's going to push I have a quote for it brother said come on [Applause] amen I believe we already satisfied amen I I I just want us to take this drink offering of this song while we are So Satisfied we need to wind down with a drink right so let's sing this song We Gather power in the name of Jesus we got the power in the name of the Lord just sit on rages we cannot be defeated we got the power in the name of the Lord oh we got the power in the name of Jesus we got the power in the name of the Lord thus it and rages we cannot be defeated we got the power in the name of the let's take it again oh we got the power in the name of [Applause] we got power In The Name Of The Lord those Satan rages [Applause] we got the power in the name of the Lord foreign [Applause] amen amen amen shall we see that amen amen I just want to share short testimony man um I'm trying to be within 15 minutes amen amen I mean I the reason why this song touched my heart so much was uh was it two two nights ago I was working and then this song came up and then I was singing singing in the car singing singing and then when I got to the the line that said do Satan rages something happened um visibility became very poor and it was very dark and then I was almost hearing um the middle pavement but um but that the Lord helped me to move quickly away from it but then I had oncoming vehicles but the Lord took me out of that amen and amen and and as soon as that happened the song became louder and louder so we got the power in the name of Jesus amen amen I just want to share with you tonight um a short word can we be outstanding amen it is it is a scripture that we all are familiar with Revelations chapter 3 verse 14. amen Revelations chapter 3 verse 14. and unto the angel of the Church of the auditions right these things said the amen the faithful and true Witness the beginning of the creation of God shall we pray father in the name of Jesus we come to you tonight Lord father I don't have any word Lord Jesus but you have the word to feed us Lord father take me aside Lord and speak your word to our hearts Lord Jesus o God we thank you we bless you in Jesus Christ and we pray amen amen my my subject tonight is identification who am I amen I don't want to say who are you the question is who am I it is personal it is personal it is a personal revelation in this last days amen identification who am I amen foreign Revelations chapter 3 verse 15. he said I Know Thy works now before that um in 14 he said um this thing said the amen the faithful and true Witness and I know somewhere in Revelations he calls his wife faithful so whatever Christ is his wife is the faithful and the true witness not just a witness but a true witness we can have a false witness we can have false Witnesses of the word we are allowed this year we have false Witnesses of the word but this is the true witness and in our this year we also have true Witnesses and through witness the beginning of the creation of God I Know Thy works that thou art neither cold nor heart I would that were cold or hot amen this is the spirit in loudicia I I I can't talk too much about it we've heard it over and over again the spirit of laodicea is such that we have one side two extremes and you can't really tell where this one is so the challenge tonight to us is who are you are you a believer of the message are you a believer of the message who am I am I identified with what the Lord has given to us the true witness are you identified with what the Lord has given to you you know sometimes let's look at this we have the head coming down to us so when somebody's speaking against their head I begin to have headache when someone is attacking the head I begin to have headache why because my head is there I am identified when somebody is speaking against the message when somebody's attacking the cloud I am having headache because you attacked my head I feel it here whatever happens in the spiritual happens in the natural amen so the question is who am I when somebody's speaking against the word that you believe and you can stay in that company my question is who are you [Applause] when somebody is living a life that is contrary to what the message is saying the question is who are you what is the spirit that is in you because the spirit in you will surely come out it is a spirit that is in you that will drive your actions it is a spirit that is in you that will move your body because your spirit inside must come out amen he said so then 16 so that because Thou Art look warm and neither cold or hot I will spill thee out of my mouth because thou say it I am rich an increase with Goods and have need of nothing and know us not that thou art wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked let's go to Acts chapter 19. amen let's just wind down with this drinking man Acts chapter 19 from verse 8. Acts 19 verse 8. and he went into the synagogue and speak broadly for the space of three months disputing and persuading the things concerning the kingdom of God but when divers were hardened and believe not but speak evil of that way before the multitude he departed from them and separated the disciples he separated the disciples Paul was preaching and he had people speaking evil about the word speaking evil about the message of Paul Paul couldn't stand it he has to separate those who believe the word something in you is going to cause a total suppression from unbelief amen so the question is who are you can you stay in that group can you stay amongst people who speak against the word but when divers were hardened and believe not but speak evil of that way before the multitude he departed from them and separated the disciples disputing daily in the school of front tiredness and this continued by the space of two years so that all their witch dwell in Asia heard the word all them that dwelled in Asia heard the word of the Lord Jesus both Jews and Greeks now let's go here verse 11. and God wrote special Miracles by the hands of Paul now God was doing these Miracles because of the message of Paul because the message must come with Vindication because my problem said that is the gospel the gospel doesn't just come in word form but it comes with the manifestations amen amen amen so while Paul was speaking the word you you have proposition coming against him but God was vindicating the word with signs and wonders he said so that from his body were brought unto the sick handkerchiefs or airplanes and the diseases departed from them and the evil spirits went out of them amen then setting of The vagable Juice now Vagabond that's the spirit that doesn't have a resting place you are neither hot nor cold we can't find your place we can find where you stand do you believe the message are you holding on to the message amen amen amen then sudden of the Vagabond Jews Exorcist magicians took upon them to call over them which had evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus saying we are judge you by Jesus whom poor preaching Jesus whom Paul preached where is their stand I see a lukewarm Spirit here Jesus who come preached but I know when the disciples when I I asked Brad Kelly was was talking about Peter and John when they went they said I have I don't have silver not gold but as I have I give to you he said in the name of the Lord Jesus so it is not a personal talk it is not what okay Jesus spoke to us and we are trying to we are trying to quote what Jesus is saying to the man that is sitting there who needs healing message believer are you saying okay brother Brown said that that's why I'm doing that or the message is now you [Applause] [Music] is it the message that William Brown preached is that how we are walking brother Brown said this so I'm doing that brother Brown said this so I'm doing that what is the objective of the message the objective of the message is to see people walking and when we are looking for the message we are seeing people amen when you identify with a message amen we will see you as a message yes amen when they begin to close the church doors when they begin to bring the message books and they are looking for the message we are going to see people walking amen we are going to see people walking Hallelujah that is objective of the message that is my identity the word is my identity amen I said 14 and there were seven sons of one skiver I was just taking thinking about these seven sons it's just pointing me to the seventh age seven sons of one skiver and these are religious people a Jew and chief of the priests their sons of the chief of the priests Pharisee amen they know the scriptures they'll come to you and tell you what brother Brown said is not true that is the spirit of laodicia amen that is the spirit of lordicia amen I have some quotes I'm going to read where problem talks about that amen I'm trying to rush amen amen and there were seven signs of one skiver a Jew and chief of the priest which did so they were the ones that were trying to you know copy what Paul was doing they're trying to imitate Paul impersonators they want to do exactly what Paul was doing but they never believed what Paul was preaching they never believe what Paul was preaching but they wanted to impersonate what Paul was doing people watch this message they look at brother Abraham's miracles and and they're like wow but they can't take the word amen when you are in this message because of the Miracles of brother Abraham a time will come you're gonna leave and the evil spirits answered and said Jesus I know Paul I know but who are you it becomes personal who are you what is your identity are you the walking message or we have to look at you and still be referring to the prophet amen when I look at you I must see the message because the message you are spoken and must put on flesh Amen in a spirit form in my spirit of Flesh amen who are you the religious demons in this last age will be asking you who are you when you are in the midst of people that are living lives contrary to the word contrary to the true word those demons will ask you who are you because you don't know which side you are why don't you put your makeup why don't you put on her here because my check doesn't do that amen amen and the evil spirit answered and said Jesus I know and Paul I know but who are you and the man in whom the evil spirit was lived on them and overcame them and prevailed against them so that they fled out they fled out of that house naked and wounded I was just looking at naked amen that's how the spirit is going to expose you when you are not identified with the true word of your age amen amen as I said I'm not going to take too long amen I'm just going to read a letter from the prophet amen amen help me Lord amen foreign amen amen so we read from the message and his exposition of the seven Church ages he said they knew the righteous life that accompanied the bearing of that name for whosoever nameth the name of the Lord let him depart from sin say Be You holy ye that the vessels of the Lord thou shall not bear the name of the Lord that God in vain so this Ephesians were Christians amen they brought a name and that name was Christ who was the spirit of God within them and which was one of the threefold names of their lord amen I continue with the same message um that's in the audition Church it said yes the land is full of corner impersonators in that last day they will try to imitate that Prophet messenger the seven sons of Giver tried to imitate Paul Simon the Sorcerer tried to imitate Peter their impersonations will be Connor they won't be able to produce what the true Prophet produces when he says the Revival is over they will go around claiming a great revelation that's what the people have is exactly right and God is going to do bigger and more wonderful things among the people and the people will fall for it they say false prophets will claim that the messenger of the last day is not a theologian so he ought not to be hurt they won't be able to produce what the messenger can they won't be Vindicated by God as that last day Prophet is but with their great swelling words and with the weight of their worldwide notoriety they want the people not to hear that man and they will say he teaches wrong they are running exactly true to their fathers their Pharisees who were of the devil for they claim that both John and Jesus taught error that's the spirit of laodicea amen those Spirits cannot take the word but they want to impersonate the Miracles amen now I want to read this message identification preaching 1964. he said our character moves us to the image of what we are our character of life does in US you see our character is modeled by what's on the inside of us and our outside only expresses what's on the inside what we are how we walk no matter what we say our life speaks louder than our words does amen if we must say I am a believer in God and I'll say well do you believe all the Bible Well I don't know then you see your lips your your very life is speaking louder then than what your words will be amen amen if you say I'm a Christian I do not believe in I do not believe all that God said is true then leave any kind of a life after that see your life speaks louder than what your testimony does [Music] amen amen said our character is molded the same message is molded in there by the light that is in us the light that is in you know to your character brother yes sir if you are in a wrong place what is in you that is moving you to that place amen something must be in you that is connected to the wrong environment right yes but no he said let me give you a more pitiful sight is to see men and women who were made in the image of God to bear his character yet housed into things and housed in by the traps of this world we are being trapped by worldly desires amen amen amen amen I'm trying to hurry up with time amen amen let's read this Romans 8. amen Romans 8 11. yes I wouldn't want to take too much time man Romans 8 11 it's a popular scripture amen he said but if the spirit I'm closing it's just short but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mother bodies by his spirit that dwelled in you amen I mean I I've just been blessed by the word coming to us as brother Kelly was preaching on Wednesday when the word comes it becomes my amen it was so interesting that morning I was meditating on the same thing and and that thing was running through my mind and when we came to church brother Kelly dropped the same thing when the world comes it now becomes mine amen so the Lord was has been opening so much to us and and we've come to realize that we must meet Christ in every form that he comes in almonds it is so important yes yes you must meet Christ as the word coming down on Sunset Mountain it has a specific fulfillment in the life of the believer amen amen because Abraham had to make God in several forms Abraham meeting God in a vision didn't change his body Abraham's seen God in a dream didn't change his body huh God must come and turn his back amen he must come and turn his back the prophet said when you are a child of God God is due to bound to reveal every secret to you there is nothing that has been exposed in this message or has been unveiled in this message that you say it doesn't belong to you every detail of Christ belongs to the bride amen amen amen amen amen so in closing this is a message identification he said now I hope that don't interfere with nothing said you see and I wouldn't want to say nothing contrary to what you've been taught I don't want to say nothing contrary to what you've been taught I'm reading from the prophet but just so that you would understand what I'm trying to get to here a reflection you've got to be identified and if you are and if you were in God's thinking at the beginning see and what's his reflection here on Earth you will bear a record of the heavenly and as he brought record of the Heavenly also and when he raised up from the grave and was given a body we when we raise up we have a body like his own glorious body amen amen amen the resurrection is sure the prophet said the resurrection is sure amen it's a guarantee and we have the earnest of it now as the Holy Ghost comes in and identifies us as God's redeemed person amen when you receive the Holy Ghost you've sealed to the journeys over amen that is your talking that you hold that shows that your fear has been paid [Applause] the fear has been paid our Resurrection is a guarantee amen he said you are a redeemed character Satan has no business with you none whatever just pick up your talking and show him my healing is paid for my trip to glory is paid for amen as talking as what you used to write on a bus line or an airplane your ticket is your talking so see take your talking the problem said you are redeemed amen the blessing the Holy Spirit and if Satan tries to push something on you just show this amen that's your identification amen he said you're identified in the resurrection of Christ you identified in his death when you die you identify in his resurrection and by that it identifies you that you were with him before the foundation of the world because you are redeemed he said that's brought back all the father has given me will come and no man can come unless he the father has given hallelujah amen amen that's a short message for tonight amen amen revived brother Stephen amen we don't want to take too much of your time we have so much doing amen amen amen to God Amen now you understand me right you understand me right you understand me right it's a preacher thing amen so always have an extra just in case amen glory to God once they start pushing good buttons they already gear into the word amen time is far gone brother Robert amen so we will see how the Lord will lead amen this is the last one who is going to be speaking tonight he's a minister from Brother Berry coffee church and he has been visiting us here many times but we never had an opportunity to get him so he came here tonight to be with us and it's brother Aaron he's right there so brother Aaron we give you 15 minutes go ahead and say something come on in and we wind up with Brad Aaron okay amen we see how times goes thank you my brother I'm sorry I put you in a lot of pressure God bless you so happy to be with you Saints accidentally love uh uh Shambo there's a name that we call him I'm not gonna tell you but but if you say Amen I'll tell you the man the name is in a white stone [Music] praise be to God uh certainly happy to be here enjoying the world uh I I don't intend to to preach for long this evening I think the ministers have done a wonderful job and I'm just gonna um just say a few things agree to the church and then we'll take it from there if we can bow our heads Heavenly Father we thank you Lord Jesus this evening Lord just fellowshipping together under the reviewed word of the hour Lord you say behold how good and how pleasant it is for the Brethren to dwell together in unity Lord is you say it's like the anointing that flowed from the head of Aaron Down To His Garment it's like the Jew on Mount Hermon father you said surely you will command a blessing Lord may you bless the church may you bless your children when you bless your your daughters who have come Lord to Fellowship under the reviewed word of the hour for where the carcass is there shall the Eagles be gathered we thank you for the carcass of the word that you have given us in these last days we commit this time into your hands in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen let's read Zechariah Chapter 12 verse 10. and I will pour out upon the House of David and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem the spirit of Grace and supplication and they shall look upon me whom they have pierced and they shall mourn for him as one morning for his only son and shall be in bitterness for him is one that is in bitterness of his firstborn you may have your seats just for a little inspiration I've never preached this anywhere it's just a thought that dropped in my heart when brother Steve said I should greet the church so it's uh the parallel of the seventh trumpet and the seventh seal now that's that is not complicated the message is not complicated it was preached by a man with great seven who came from the Southern Hills of Kentucky who was eating cornbread Hallelujah and he was hunting raccoons and shooting squirrels so the message is simple yes my brother Hallelujah yes don't be intimidated by the title the message is very simple yes my brother Hallelujah so if you know the seventh the trumpet yes sir then you know the seven the seal because the seventh trumpet is equal to the seventh seal that's right Hallelujah yes ma'am what is the seventh the trumpet it's God you're revealing himself to the Jews sir yes sir but it does not come in flesh he comes to a prophet and the prophet is Moses in the light chart that's right Hallelujah yes sir I wondered all my life out of millions of Jews in Israel why only 144 000 receive the Holy Ghost they were expecting a messiah to come in flesh they're expecting a messiah to come with nails cut hands but he comes behind a son of man that is the son of man revealing the son of man praise be to God that's your seventh to trumpet my friends my brother Hallelujah yes sir praise be together and the prophet says in the Feast of trumpets that the trumpets are to the Jews what the seals are to the Gentiles that's right Hallelujah so God takes a Godless from Israel hallelujah how many knows that Jesus Christ is Joseph and how did Joseph reveal himself to the to his brothers he dismissed his gentle bride that's right Hallelujah because he wants to show himself to his brothers and he took his brothers and he shot him the sign of circumcision he showed him his Casa and they worked for him they realized that they saw their brother yes so here Zechariah is saying that when he shall come that's right every tribe shall be morning for him like someone who is mourning for his only child when Jesus Christ reveals himself to Israel praise be to God now the prophet teaches us here that you know the Jews they have seven feasts how many knows that what's God deals with Israel through the feast you have passed over and live in bread first fruit and Pentecost and that's in the spring and in the Foy of the trumpets atonement and Tabernacles now Tabernacles is the Millennium but before Tabernacles there is a feast of atonement now the Feast of atonement they call it Yom Kippur it's the holiest Feast of the Jews Hallelujah if you don't observe Yom Kippur you are cut off from Israel praise be to God but the prophet says on the Feast of atonement they are not going to slay a lamp they are not going to slay a bullock because the Bullock is the slain at Passover Hallelujah but the Feast of Tabernacles the prophet says it's a feast of mourning they are recognizing the true atonement praise be to God Hallelujah so that is the seventh trumpet now we come to the seventh seal and Paul says the Lord himself now the whole operation is God himself it's not William Branham it's not Stephen chamber but the Lord himself shall come down from heaven praise be together Hallelujah they are looking for Jesus that was walking the streets of Galilee they are looking for Jesus that is a Jewish here they are looking for Jesus that they are seeing on the picture there no sir Jesus is called a Karma and it will not be revealed by the son of man if you miss the son of man then you miss Jesus praise be to God Hallelujah says when the seventh Angels Came To Me the servant one appeared more to me that thing that I wondered about all my life by seven the seal was the ministry of William Branham son of man revealing the son of manner that's right hallelujah praise be together so Jesus Christ is here that he is living the bride yes my brother glory to God hallelujah hallelujah it's a cheater that is under her messenger the final voice [Applause] we did not follow cuddling with Divine samples We are following Jesus if someone says I'm leaving the messenger the message is the Bible I say which message baptism in the name of Jesus no the truth about marriage and divorce no if you are leaving the message which message hallelujah praise be together we are at a junction and the prophet says that a junction is a very dangerous place many accidents happen at the junction that's why there's a traffic light and you have to look at the traffic light and we are at a junction and the provinces at every Junction yes sir God sends an angel Hallelujah there's a junction tonight yes it's 20 22 and 2023 and they say angel yes that's your traffic lighter anything go my brother go my brother go my brother yes my brother bless me to God you say Watchmen what of the night no doubt in the mega churches they are saying well 2023 is going to be the year of this oh it's going to be the year of Excellence or it's going to be the prosperity they are saying that in many churches tonight but if you are a a Makaya you only prophesy according to Elijah now Darkness shall cover the Earth and it gloss Darkness shall come from the people that's right Hallelujah so 2023 is going to be an evil year according to the scriptures and the prophecies right but under the blood of Jesus Christ [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah there is going to be recession that there is going to be War Russia is going to get aggressive but the brighter shalom shalom shalom other people are going to lose their jobs other businesses are going to closer but to wish you my brother yes you are not bound by timer you are in the dispensation of the servantes [Applause] you are now in eternity that's exactly hallelujah hallelujah there are 22 letters in the Hebrew alphabet so 23 is now eternity we are now going into eternity my brother [Applause] praise be to God it's a junction when women come to menopause it's a junction many people go into divorce when they come to menopause because it's a junction Junctions are very dangerous that's right when kids come to to adolescent it's a junction that's right but when a sunshine comes God sends an angel versus an Angel that's right well there was a junction Old Testament in the New Testament God sent Elijah his name was John that's right Hallelujah the pride is not confused because she is looking at the angel but the night also your blessing is gonna come but if we gonna come in the land also Hallelujah praise be to God now I understand I want to say this as I close Numbers Chapter 6. God commanded Aaron says you shall bless that each of the children of Israel in this wise may God bless you and his first shine upon it's a Commandment that God gave to the high priest to bless the people hallelujah and as the minister of the Gospel yes sir we are commanded to pray for the people and we are commanded to bless the people that's right God bless you in 2023 my brother God Prosper you in 2023 his face shine upon you [Applause] shine upon you yes sir I have many quotations here I don't have time to read them but please let me read why please please [Music] I kept my promise we call him igushembo Prophet says here in the Feast of trumpets paragraph 155 says not notice exactly the continuity of the scripture under the second trumpet is to Israel the same as the seventh seal was to the church yes sir that's a quotation the seventh trumpet messenger is all prophets now the seventh somebody is two prophets Muslim Elijah and the seventh Sue is one Prophet Elijah but the spirit of Moses was also operating in the life of Elijah there was a sister called sister schreider in Shreveport Louisiana she spoke in tongues and said the spirit of Elijah and Moses is going to minister in this place and the prophet says she picked the conversation I had with the angel Hallelujah remember myself and Moses behold I sent you Elijah the prophet that like Hallelujah the servant the seal each the second trumpet you cannot have the Rapture without the serving the seal Hallelujah Hallelujah because heaven and his portions this when when when the people that died in the time of fall they were gathered together with Paul and they were sealed with Paul in that portion of heaven was closed and coluba came and his portion was closer now the only Heaven that is open oh my God The Only Heaven that is open right now is the portion of Elijah Hallelujah not by might not by power but by my spirit says the Lord remember the witch of woman the creditors come and they wanted to take her children because that his husband yet died in debt a type of Adam and and the Widow a type of the church the enemy comes to take the children into sea and bondage that's right and and then Elisha came her and said what do you have I have a little oil I have a little oil just bring more bottles bring more balancer bring more body Elsa I am speaking to barrels tonight the oil shall sustain you in 2023. God bless you [Applause] foreign [Applause] whoever stayed home and didn't wanna come tonight I'm sorry for you that's why it's good to be in church [Applause] you see what he does to your body you see what he does to you he makes you happy [Applause] brother God bless you welcome to spoken word [Applause] amen amen I feel for him he was feeling a different pool that's what I feel all the time my brother wonderful message glory glory to God [Applause] did you stumble when they say the portion of Heaven is closed did you stumble it's a portion of Heaven that belongs to the bride [Applause] that's what I meant in other words the Bride of Jesus Christ have a number and in every age God opened the door and pour a number like for instance in Ephesus God knows that I will post 6 million when six million finish God closes then he opened another door and he suck his children and God closes so the last door for the Gentile blood that is left Israel now and God is just calling his children home sucking his electron in other words the only available atonement oh blood is under this message [Applause] and once God finishes and closes then God turned back to the Jewish people whoever is left is the foolish virgin they go under a different compartment in heaven but not the comportment of the bread we are the VIP we are the Bride of the Lamb we are him we came from his side we are the wife of the Lamb because the marriage of the Lamb have come and his brother had made herself glory to God [Applause] [Music] [Applause] I don't know what to do I just have to say that to stabilize somebody who was probably uh uh uh what's struggling when they say that the only door of Heaven the heaven of the Bride the bride has a place like the Old Testament when they were dying they were going in the bosom of Abraham it's written in the Bible so if you die you don't see Abraham something is wrong with you you must make sure you are where Abraham is so when the lamb is screaming on the cross then he can get there and pull you out from there do you know the last one to close the door of Abraham it was a thief come on everybody okay he didn't go to the water baptism they therefore thought he's gonna crucify his life but the devil positioned him wrong [Applause] so sometimes the devil put you in the corner and think that is where he's going to crucify you he's not going to crucify you he just positioned you on the right spot because that's the place you're gonna enter Heaven who would doubt somebody who got to Paradise on the cross it doesn't matter where the devil can put you God will find you [Applause] glory to God I was telling somebody I say when they say the thief of the Cross we miss the trouble we don't understand that pretty good when they say the thief if you go steal something are they gonna kill you but those Thief were condemned to death so they were not really Thief just fifth they were criminals to the highest level until the state decided that there is no way somebody like this can leave they need to send them to the firing squad but right there the firing squad [Music] everybody okay somebody just spoke and say Lord the Bible says no one can call Jesus except by their can you speak loud [Applause] are you afraid the Bible said no one can call Jesus except by water so who spoke through that Thief [Applause] have you ever thought about it have you ever thought about it what can you speak that would touch the Heart of Jesus and Jesus turned around he said wait a minute [Music] today you and me we're going to the same place [Applause] he said Lord remember me and Jesus didn't go straight to Abraham Jesus went to the souls in prison and he left that person go so when he knocked at the clock on the door Abraham opened the door he said who are you he said I am a thief Abraham said how can the fifth come here he said I don't know sir you ask him he told me to be here if you have any problem to ask me wait for my attorney he has my case [Applause] Abraham could not make it to heaven without that person [Applause] I am stretching you in my language they call thatness [Applause] [Music] we got too much Pentecostal study too much Pentecostal thinking God is a human being God is a man he's Jesus Christ when you talk to him in 2023 talk to him like a man he understands you he understands what you're going through he's not a strange God like Buddha who doesn't understand what I went through brother Robert whoever start this thing here I don't know it's 11 32. let's get the wine and the bread and enter into 23. I don't think we can make it to the water amen let's stand [Laughter] oh my God I wish we had more time amen amen amen everybody ready hallelujah hallelujah halleluia at least the last day of the year make an effort to be in church make it special to show God that I'm grateful for everything that you have done we are alive we made it who would have thought when we were in kovid 19. amen oh my God let's go to First Corinthians chapter 11. glory to God a wonderful wonderful I'm sorry those that online the first video stop at a certain time so we started the second one we tried to combine both of them brother Enoch later on we can put it together and put one sermon amen First Corinthians chapter 11 verse 20. um um I calculated all of them but they keep going over time amen glory to God if you're there you can say a man let's go to verse 20. the Bible says when you come together therefore into one place this is not to eat the Lord's Supper in other words we can we're not coming to a restaurant where we're sitting because we're hungry and we're trying to eat food we're not coming because we're hungry or we we are hungering for something that's not the reason why we're coming we're coming as a commandment of the Lord the Bible says in verse 21 for in eating everyone taketh before other his own supper and one is hungry and another is drunken in other words you're coming wrong if you want to eat you eat at home but when you come here we're trying to do something verse 22 Paul say what have ye not houses to eat and to drinking or despise ye the Church of God and shame them that have not what shall I say to you shall I Praise You In This I praise you not in other words you don't come here to eat or to drink we do that at home we're coming here for something else even though it's called the Lord supper it's not really a natural supper but you have a meaningful Christian the Bible says in verse 23 for I have received of the Lord that which also I delivered unto you so what Paul is saying here is not something he came up with it it's not a figment of his imagination that he came up and then is that I mean instituted something in the church so the instruction to the Lord's Supper it's a Commandment that came from God it's a revelation that was unfolded to God because God himself gave communion to Abraham in the person of Melchizedek he gave him wine and bread amen so it's not something that comes from human being verse 23 for I receive of the Lord that which also are delivered unto you that the Lord Jesus the Same not in which he was betrayed took bread and when he had given thanks he break it and say take it this this is my body which is broken for you this do in remembrance of me so it's a commandment of God to do this to remember him brother Bradham say he was in the first atonement when Israel was living the land of Egypt they have to take the bread and break it and eat it and brother Branham say watching the old atonement that bread kept them 40 years walking and kept even their clothing and if an anti-tap a shadow can do that to human being how much what we have the Lamb of God the Lord Jesus Christ amen he says after the man the same manner also he took the cup when he had stopped saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this du this do ye as often as ye drink it in remembrance of me amen for as often as you eat this bread verse 26 and drink this cup ye do show the Lord's death till he come we know they're coming wherefore whatsoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord onwardly shall be guilty of the body or in the blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat that of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eat it and drinketh unworldly eat if and drinketh Damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if we judge ourselves we shall not be judged but when we are judged we are chastened of the Lord that we should not be condemned with the world wherefore my brethren when you come together to eat Terry one for another and a family man hunger let him let him eat a home that he come not together unto condemnation and the rest will accept in order when I come let's bow our head and pray as the opening the bread and the wine and brother Robert will starting to break the bread Heavenly Father Lord we are approaching you humbly tonight father thanking you for your grace for your love and for your mercy that I have started with us Lord this year and that is finishing

but let's go ahead and fulfill it amen verse 13 and verse 1 now before the Feast of the Passover when Jesus knew that his hour tomorrow we got service at 11 o'clock uh at 12 o'clock not at 11 o'clock so I'm saying that so you're not under pressure amen now before the Feast of the Passover when Jesus knew that his hour was come that he should depart out of this world unto the father having loved his own not everybody which were in the world he loved them unto the end watch this and supper being ended just with the way we did it we just ended the supper supper been ended the devil having put having now put into the heart of Judas is carried someone's son to betray him Jesus knowing that the father has given all things into his hand and that he was come from God and went to God he risen from supper which we just finished so we coupling supper with the washing of the feet amen Jesus did it himself he runs it from supper and laid aside His Garment and took a towel and girded himself after that he poureth water into a basin and began to wash the disciples feet and to wipe them with the tower wherewith he was girded why do we do this why do we have to do this if it's a commandment we gotta do it if the people are not doing it they are breaking a commandment of God Amen then cometh he to summon Peter and Peter say unto him Lord does not wash my feet Jesus answered and say unto him what I do that no is not now but Thou shalt know Hereafter Peter say unto him Thou shalt never wash my feet Jesus answered him if I wash thee not that has no part with me you see how serious this is someone it might sound like something simple but Jesus said if I don't do it you don't have any part with me amen Simon Peter say unto him Lord not my feet only but also my hands and my head Jesus said to him he that is washed needed not safe to wash his feet because that's where you're walking around but he's clean every wheat and ye are clean but not all for he knew who should betray him therefore say he ye are not all clean so after he had washed their feet he had taken His Garment and was set down again he say unto them know ye what I have done to you ye call me master and Lord and you say well in other words it's true that I'm a master and I'm the Lord for so I am verse 14 if I then your Lord and Master have washed your feet ye also ought to wash one another's feet that's a commandment from the Lord so we doing it because God says so verse 15 for I have given you an example Jesus didn't look at their feet how they are or make sure their feet are clean before he touched them amen he washed all of them one person washing all of him it's an example verse 15 he said for I have given you an example that ye should do regardless of your sanitation you should do as I have done to you who want to wash Jesus feet everybody will rush you have a Jesus here beside you amen whatever you did unto the list of man you did it unto me so take opportunity wash his feet also as we
