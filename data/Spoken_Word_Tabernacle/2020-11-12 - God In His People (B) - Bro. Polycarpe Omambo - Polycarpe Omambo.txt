will continue to work it out and once everything is fixed connected then they go ahead and send the link so we'll just remind me at the end of the service so we can apologize for the issue that is going on i know folks has been under anticipation waiting and expecting to hear something from the lord because i need to give the announcement for the reading for this coming sunday lord's willing amen so you can read esther chapter 3 amen and esther chapter 4 for those who can you can also read exodus chapter 17 if you want to get a good good good help amen if not you're going to read it on sunday but if you want your mind to be connected exodus chapter 17 esther chapter 3 and esther chapter 4 that book continued to unfold unfold unfold and i have nothing else to do but to follow the leadership of the holy spirit amen we have brother polycarp again with us tonight amen he's one of our local here with buddy kelly they are helping tremendously trying to put a shoulder to the wheel and make sure we all move on the same direction so brother caleb is in a boot camp for three months so i will be interpreting for you amen so we're going to give him his liberty what a polycarb as we sing only believe he will come to the front and take the service and if somebody can record i don't know if your cell phone or something that would be great until the connection comes let's sing only believe don't be distracted let them work let's focus on the word amen well lord all things are possible all [Music] oh [Music] lord i believe lord i believe all things are possible [Music] all things are possible one more time jesus is here jesus all things are possible [Music] jesus [Music] [Music] i greet you all in the name of the lord jesus christ i thank the lord jesus christ there are many that are sick that are still in the hospital the more some are already declared to be dead but you and me by his grace we are in his house tonight that's the reason why we are thanking him and we believe that his presence is here before you came to this building the angel of the lord was already here god was already here god richly bless you i thank the pastor it is not up to everybody to do it they will not open their door to bring other ministers to preach it but if you notice not only to local minister did he open the door but he is calling either minister from other churches as well and they all are contributing to bring in the word of god and i believe with my heart that's the leadership of the holy spirit [Music] and those five ministries are not in one person it's the firefall ministry that edifies the body today the world are making fun of the churches they are making fun of christians they are even asking questions where is the power of god we must be the carrier of the entire power of god that's the reason why we are grateful to our god for our pattern and we always support him with prayer that the lord protect him and bless him and bless also his family his children and his wife if we love our pastor we are supposed to be praying for him why because he's a target if the devil wants to struggle he will first start by the shepherd amen amen but we should pray for him in our home may the lord richly bless you hallelujah hallelujah his presence is already here the presence of the lord is here it's not by any chance that you hear tonight this
