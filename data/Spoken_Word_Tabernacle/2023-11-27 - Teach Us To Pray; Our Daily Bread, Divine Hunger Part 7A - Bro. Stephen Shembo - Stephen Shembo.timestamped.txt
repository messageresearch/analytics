[25:21] that me and Lily re we recently moved
[25:24] this week up here to North
[25:26] Carolina
[25:38] there's a few things that led up to this
[25:40] happening um a lot of lot of prayer and
[25:44] uh but but God has just been moving in
[25:47] our lives really for the past year uh
[25:50] since we got married I just wanted to uh
[25:53] put before the Lord like my job and uh
[25:56] the church
[25:58] where we you know because I wanted I
[25:59] wanted to be in the will of the Lord and
[26:01] everything that I was doing so I just
[26:04] really went before the Lord and was
[26:06] praying God just direct me I want to be
[26:08] in your perfect will I want to be at the
[26:10] church you want me to go to whether it's
[26:12] the church that I grew up in because you
[26:14] know um been there my whole life I had a
[26:16] lot of you know faith in the ministry
[26:19] there and everything but I was like
[26:21] wherever you need me to be I just want
[26:23] to be there so um I was praying that you
[26:28] know uh I wanted to get into a trade and
[26:32] that was kind of like my my goal at the
[26:34] time is I wanted to I Really at the time
[26:36] I was thinking electrical or HVAC and so
[26:39] I was looking into opportunities for
[26:41] that and I was looking into um
[26:44] opportunities around the area where
[26:46] where we're living in Georgia but uh my
[26:49] brother-in-law who lives in South
[26:50] Carolina he works in HVAC in Buford and
[26:54] he offered he uh talked to his boss and
[26:57] he was like we could get you an
[26:58] opportunity up here where where we live
[27:01] and get you working up here so I was
[27:04] like well Lord you know this is what
[27:06] I've been praying about maybe this is
[27:07] where maybe this is the opportunity that
[27:09] you're putting in my lap so I talked to
[27:12] the guy and you know he's a brother in
[27:14] the church really really great guy and
[27:17] uh so he sent me an offer
[27:20] letter and I
[27:23] uh I um went you know went ahead and
[27:26] applied and everything and started I was
[27:28] like as soon as I can find a place to
[27:29] live then I uh will move over there and
[27:33] I'll start working so started looking
[27:35] for places to live and nothing was
[27:37] working out just we found this apartment
[27:40] complex that looked promising that
[27:43] didn't well it didn't work out that fell
[27:45] through it was just one thing after
[27:47] another just wasn't working out um so I
[27:51] just kept praying like Lord you know I
[27:53] thought this was I F I felt led like
[27:55] this is what we were supposed to do and
[27:57] you know I trying to line up the three
[27:58] lights that brother brandom said to do
[27:59] when we when you're seeking the will of
[28:01] the Lord so I was like well you know it
[28:04] doesn't seem like those lights are
[28:06] lining up perfectly so time to get back
[28:09] to praying again so I went back I was at
[28:12] work one day and I was like Lord this
[28:13] isn't working out just tell show me what
[28:17] you need to do I'm just put it in your
[28:18] hands I'm just keep doing what I'm doing
[28:21] I'm going just keep living how I've been
[28:23] living you know and so we came and
[28:27] visited
[28:28] here uh sometime mid
[28:31] October and uh Lily's parents were
[28:34] talking about us moving up here and I
[28:37] was like you know I really hadn't put
[28:39] much thought into it because you know I
[28:41] didn't have a job up here I was like
[28:44] where would I work you know what what uh
[28:46] opportunity would I would I be able to
[28:49] take on so um I just that night I just
[28:53] went into a room alone and I was just
[28:56] praying and I was like Lord if this is
[28:58] your
[28:59] will then just speak to your brother
[29:01] Steven
[29:02] tomorrow and little dead I know Lily was
[29:06] in the other room speaking or not
[29:08] speaking uh praying the same thing so at
[29:12] the same time we were praying that and I
[29:13] was like Lord you know I know you've
[29:15] spoke to me many times before through
[29:17] brother Stephen directly to him so I was
[29:19] like I know that I'll get my answer um
[29:23] so I just put it before him like that so
[29:26] the next day we came into church
[29:28] and uh brother stepen came out and I
[29:31] don't know if you want to play the video
[29:33] what he
[29:36] said a blessing for you zacha so
[29:40] you but by God's grace you welcome to
[29:43] spoken word Tabernacle and we trust it's
[29:45] going to be a blessing for you zacha saw
[29:48] you it's time to move
[29:53] [Applause]
[29:56] northward
[29:59] wait a minute brother Sten brother
[30:00] Steven after he says that he looks at
[30:02] everybody and he goes just chill out
[30:05] this is between Zach and I he didn't
[30:07] know what he was
[30:11] saying but by God's grace you
[30:15] [Applause]
[30:20] welcome then after part of the
[30:23] service after that he actually um he
[30:27] confirmed it twice by also reading the
[30:29] scripture after which was Deuteronomy uh
[30:32] chapter 2 verse two which was you've
[30:34] Compass this mountain long enough turn
[30:36] you northward so I was like wow so Lily
[30:41] looked at me and she was crying I
[30:44] started crying I was like that's not a
[30:46] confirmation I don't know what is so I
[30:49] went home and I was like well that
[30:52] sounds like a direct answer to what I
[30:53] was praying for Lord but you need to
[30:55] give me a job too and I know that's your
[30:57] will then of course you'll give me a job
[31:00] so that same week the end of that same
[31:04] exact
[31:05] week I had applied to a few different
[31:08] places and uh I got a call from uh this
[31:14] company in Gastonia as an HVAC company
[31:18] and the position that I applied for
[31:19] wasn't the exact position that I wanted
[31:22] but I was like maybe I can get in the
[31:23] company and and everything but after
[31:25] talking to me on the phone they were
[31:26] like you know you sound like you would
[31:28] be a really good technician was that
[31:30] what you and that's exactly what I
[31:31] wanted to do so I was like Lord You're
[31:34] just provide me got everything I
[31:43] need that was a confirmation there of
[31:45] course we have a place to live and
[31:46] everything God's just provided
[31:48] everything we've had need of so

[48:22] member God richly bless you and uh
[48:26] sister Lily welcome welcome welcome and
[48:29] brother Zach welcome to spoken word
[48:32] Tabernacle I believe everybody is up to
[48:35] date with the sermon and I believe each
[48:38] one of you we are reading our Bible
[48:40] twice a day one chapter in the morning
[48:43] one chapter before we go to bed summer
[48:46] reading the church ages 70 weeks of
[48:49] Daniel the seals adoption what else
[48:53] again and the message of the hour some
[48:56] amen because our conversation should be
[48:59] all about the
[49:02] word amen amen if you do one day without
[49:07] talking about Jesus that's a problem
[49:10] right amen because he is the word amen
[49:15] we talked about the prophet because the
[49:18] messenger and the message I want so when
[49:21] we say brother Bram say actually we not
[49:25] really talking about brother Bram we are
[49:27] talking about the message that brother
[49:29] brandham brought but it's hard to
[49:32] separate the message from its messenger
[49:36] so when you quote my name you only quote
[49:38] my name if I'm talking about the
[49:42] word everybody okay so when you say
[49:45] brother Steven you say brother Steven
[49:47] say that brother Bram say that the Bible
[49:49] say then my name can be associated in
[49:52] other words my name doesn't have to be
[49:54] associated every day but Jesus name have
[49:58] to be Associated every day the message
[50:01] of the hour every day so we talk about
[50:03] the word every single day we talk about
[50:07] brother Charles if he spoke something
[50:09] that concerned the word of God then his
[50:11] name could be Associated but not really
[50:14] talking about him it's talking about the
[50:16] Revelation that the Lord put into him
[50:19] are we clear amen so let's spend our
[50:21] time reading the word listening to the
[50:23] word and talking about the word am do
[50:26] not go one day without talking about the
[50:29] word am because he is the word we clear
[50:32] so
[50:33] far amen glory to God December 2nd that
[50:38] will be the young Sisters Meeting and
[50:41] the venue is already confirmed sister
[50:44] Devon I believe you already sent the
[50:45] message not yet okay you go ahead and
[50:48] send the message so everybody knows
[50:49] where the venue is It's a Wonderful
[50:52] venue it's a prefer venue for the young
[50:54] sister so you know what it means amen so
[50:58] the venue is already confirmed I will
[51:00] still wait for brother abble because of
[51:02] the conflict of the date to make sure
[51:04] for the youngst men meeting and December
[51:07] the 23rd this is when we have our
[51:09] question and answer and Lord's willing
[51:12] I'll take maybe 15 minute give the
[51:14] trustee a little bit the minute so he
[51:16] can present uh what we have in the
[51:18] building fund and then from there just
[51:21] give more clarification where we are as
[51:23] far as the building fund so and uh and
[51:26] the building project so if you have any
[51:28] question make sure you're there and the
[51:30] Lord will uh answer your question not me
[51:33] but the Lord will answer your question
[51:36] amen I had a question based on what I
[51:39] spoke last Sunday a mention uh that Adam
[51:43] was the only one that didn't have a
[51:45] belly button amen you remember that amen
[51:49] you remember that and somebody asked a
[51:51] question and send a question say Eve
[51:54] also did not have a belly button right
[51:57] so when the person sent me the message
[52:00] he just opened me up like who I say well
[52:02] I was more emphasizing on Adam and here
[52:06] I missed Eve so since he was spoken on
[52:09] the
[52:10] pulpit he have to be corrected back on
[52:13] the pulpit everybody okay and when I say
[52:17] corrected back the Holy Spirit drop a
[52:19] scripture say Eve also was called
[52:23] Adam exactly right
[52:27] I'm just repeating what happened to me
[52:31] amen when I say I'm going to correct and
[52:33] I'm going to say Eve the Holy Spirit
[52:34] drum a scripture say but Eve was called
[52:38] Adam can you say amen amen don't worry
[52:41] let me give you the scripture so that
[52:43] works out
[52:46] amen the Bible says in Genesis chapter 5
[52:49] verse 1 and two that this is the book of
[52:52] the generation of who Adam in the day
[52:55] that God created who man in the likeness
[52:58] of God made he him how male and female
[53:02] created he them and God did what blessed
[53:05] them and called their name what
[53:09] Adam so when you say Adam it's a name
[53:13] for a male and a female
[53:15] amen everybody okay so if Adam didn't
[53:20] have a belly button what do you think
[53:23] Eve what do you think they can't what do
[53:27] you think the answer should be no belly
[53:29] Buton because whatever speak of the
[53:32] groom also speak of
[53:34] what but let me help you up so you don't
[53:38] say brother Steven say you say brother
[53:41] Bram says brother Bram they ask him a
[53:44] question uh this is the key to the door
[53:47] in paragraph 123 he say someone asked
[53:50] the other day he said brother
[53:52] BR would there be any difference between
[53:55] who Adam and Eve even though we know
[53:58] Adam and Eve both of them are called
[54:00] Adam amen and their children today if
[54:04] they were all naked walking would their
[54:08] bodies be the same so the question is
[54:12] about the body of Adam and Eve brother
[54:15] brandham say I say no sir in other words
[54:18] there was a difference between the body
[54:20] of Adam and Eve and our body we would
[54:23] like to know what is the difference
[54:25] brother Bram say we was coming home from
[54:27] squirrel hunting brother Fred and I and
[54:30] a bunch of them I say no they would not
[54:33] be the same Amen brother brandham help
[54:35] me more give me the difference say you
[54:38] mean Eve would not be a woman like her
[54:41] daughters and Adam would not be a man
[54:43] like his son I said in many respect but
[54:47] not in all physical aspect respect he
[54:52] said what will be the difference uhuh I
[54:56] said what they wouldn't have they not
[54:59] Adam they both Adam and Eve they would
[55:03] not have what any
[55:08] naal So Adam did not have a naal evil
[55:12] also did not have an evil
[55:15] why William Marion Bram they were how
[55:19] created right they was not attached to
[55:22] what nothing in other word they didn't
[55:24] have a mama
[55:28] as long as they bear there on everything
[55:31] that is born in the world in in this
[55:33] world sure it's a renegade to begin with
[55:35] because we're born in sin that's right I
[55:38] said sure there is a difference they
[55:40] would not have no nille they was not
[55:43] connected to any what female to come how
[55:46] here God did what created them so who
[55:49] didn't have a belly Buton Adam and Eve
[55:52] any
[55:54] question Adam did not have a belly
[55:57] button male and female no belly button
[56:00] because they were they never came out
[56:02] from a woman they came straight from God
[56:05] and they were created is that clear
[56:07] enough we clear so let's go to our
[56:10] scripture
[56:16] [Laughter]
[56:20] then I love the message of the hour good
[56:23] to see you my brother
[56:25] welcome again to spoken
[56:27] word you will need your
[56:30] Bible amen glory
[56:38] glory brother you greet Ark for me he's

[56:49] chapter 3 verse 17 if you dare you can
[56:53] say Amen
[56:55] before I move there let me remind you
[56:59] this so we understand how we moving
[57:03] on in Genesis 29 verse one uh chapter 1
[57:08] verse 29 we showed you clearly the diet
[57:12] of a man you remember that and the Bible
[57:15] say God said behold I have given you
[57:19] every herb bearing what seeds so man was
[57:22] eating seeds amen amen that that's why
[57:25] we have peanut and all kind of stuff
[57:28] it's seed there's nothing wrong you good

[57:43] human diet the human diet was what
[57:49] seed herb bearing every seed so you get

[57:58] which is upon the face of the Earth and
[58:01] every tree in the which is the fruit of
[58:06] the tree yielding what seed so man was
[58:09] eating seed and
[58:12] fruits and those fruits must have seed
[58:14] in it so when you eat you get the seed
[58:17] you put it back again and then we can
[58:19] have more
[58:20] fruit Amen to you it shall be water me
[58:25] so that was the diet of man and in verse
[58:28] 30 it was the diet of the animal kingdom
[58:31] or bird kingdom whatever you call it
[58:35] amen amen what was the diet and to every
[58:39] beast of the earth and to every F of the
[58:41] air and to everything that creepeth upon
[58:44] the Earth wherein there is life I have
[58:47] given water every green herb for
[58:50] meat every green herb so so if it's not
[58:55] green I don't know every Green her amen
[58:59] for food amen we clear there now let's
[59:02] go to Genesis 17 now you understand how
[59:05] we're
[59:06] climing glory to
[59:09] God you there verse 17 and to Adam he
[59:15] said because you have hearkened to the
[59:18] voice of your wife we went through
[59:21] this and have eaten of the tree of which
[59:25] I commanded you saying you shall not eat
[59:28] of the of it curse is the ground we

[59:37] the ground for your sake in other word
[59:40] instead of cursing you I'm cursing the
[59:42] ground everybody okay but the food was
[59:46] coming from the ground the tree was
[59:48] bringing food from the ground and the
[59:51] herb were bringing food from the AR uh I

[1:00:13] in sorrow man was eating
[1:00:16] happily amen but God now introduced
[1:00:20] sorrow amen he says in sorrow shall you
[1:00:25] eat of it all the days of your what life
[1:00:30] so the meat of man is now mingle with
[1:00:37] suffering everybody okay it was God Who

[1:00:58] field stop in Genesis 29 before the fall
[1:01:03] man was eating what seed and what fruit
[1:01:06] now God upgrade the
[1:01:11] diet now Man became a
[1:01:17] vegetarian is there is my Bible
[1:01:20] different than
[1:01:21] yours men can eat salad
[1:01:25] yes after the fall is that a
[1:01:29] problem which version of the Bible do
[1:01:31] you have my
[1:01:34] friend so the diet is upgrade now men
[1:01:38] can eat what now the human diet man now
[1:01:43] can eat
[1:01:44] herb amen you can eat herb grass amen
[1:01:50] you shall eat herb of the field verse 19
[1:01:54] in the sweat of your face shall you eat
[1:01:58] what bread the first time bread is
[1:02:01] mentioned in the
[1:02:04] scripture we
[1:02:06] clear so bread food was given to men
[1:02:11] without any sweat that's
[1:02:14] right amen because it was all provided
[1:02:18] by God but according to Genesis 3:19 it
[1:02:22] looks like man now is
[1:02:25] responsible to
[1:02:27] work and to sweat for his own
[1:02:31] food so the responsibility kind of move
[1:02:34] from God to man are we
[1:02:38] together you need to stay up so in
[1:02:41] Genesis chapter
[1:02:44] 3 verse 19 it seems like man now is
[1:02:50] responsible amen amen for his own food
[1:02:55] amen for he's bread amen and he has to
[1:03:00] sweat it
[1:03:02] up Amen in other word when man have food
[1:03:07] he can
[1:03:12] brag can I in in Genesis man was not
[1:03:17] working man was just walking around and
[1:03:20] look at the tree get the food eat and
[1:03:22] move on no work amen there is nothing
[1:03:25] for men to
[1:03:27] brag in Genesis chapter 1 man was
[1:03:31] dependent
[1:03:33] amen totally from God but in Genesis
[1:03:38] 3:19 it looks like men now can work work
[1:03:41] work work and when he get food man can
[1:03:44] say I need to eat my food I work for it
[1:03:47] I need to eat my
[1:03:50] money yeah I swe it out I was there
[1:03:53] clocking in clocking I cannot sit I'm

[1:04:03] was there outside cutting the grass

[1:04:10] money it looks like man become
[1:04:17] self-existent can I continue can I
[1:04:22] continue Have I Lost

[1:23:50] from the word amen the sky came from the
[1:23:53] word so everything that exist was from
[1:23:56] the word amen amen that's why in the
[1:23:59] beginning he was existing by himself
[1:24:02] amen that's why he was Elohim eloh there
[1:24:06] was nothing else but God and God shrank
[1:24:10] himself so that he can create space into

[1:24:50] himself into a light
[1:24:54] if you never seen that light that's the

[1:27:31] says this in the book of Colossians
[1:27:33] chapter one Paul say for by who him we
[1:27:37] clear were all things created amen
[1:27:42] everything that was created was created
[1:27:44] by Him if you want to create something
[1:27:47] you need to meet that light
[1:27:51] amen
[1:27:53] if you don't have anything and you want

[1:27:57] contact with the positive because in him
[1:28:01] is everything he have the blueprint he
[1:28:04] have the
[1:28:06] software he has the
[1:28:09] master he has the server of everything
[1:28:12] that
[1:28:15] existed if you ask him you say how can I
[1:28:17] make a square he can pull from his
[1:28:20] database and say this is the way you
[1:28:22] make a
[1:28:24] square are we
[1:28:27] together is it too
[1:28:29] strong glory to God Paul says for by him
[1:28:34] were all things how created that are
[1:28:37] where in heaven and where are in Earth
[1:28:39] how
[1:28:41] visible so God did that just created
[1:28:45] what you can see even the things that
[1:28:48] you cannot see were created from him in
[1:28:52] other word in him are we together in him
[1:28:56] was the visible and the invisible things
[1:29:01] all of them were compacting him so when
[1:29:04] God begin to create he was not just
[1:29:06] creating the visible things that we can
[1:29:09] see God was also creating the invisible
[1:29:16] things are we together are we together
[1:29:20] he says of things visible and what
[1:29:24] invisible where did they be what Thrones
[1:29:27] you know what it means we already went
[1:29:29] through this and what Dominion you know
[1:29:31] what it means right and what
[1:29:33] principality and what power all category
[1:29:36] of Angel was in him
[1:29:39] Amen in other word this light is a full
[1:29:44] [Music]
[1:29:47] package are we together are we together
[1:29:50] all things work created what by him and
[1:29:54] what for
[1:29:58] him we clear look to Hebrew 11:3 the
[1:30:02] Bible say through what faith revelation
[1:30:05] we do what understand so Revelation give
[1:30:08] you understanding amen hallelujah
[1:30:13] am oh this is an understanding this is
[1:30:16] just understanding Revelation give
[1:30:19] understanding people in the Mage this is
[1:30:21] just
[1:30:22] understanding this is just an
[1:30:24] understanding it's a revelation that
[1:30:26] give you understanding amen through
[1:30:30] faith we do what understand that's what
[1:30:32] the worlds were plural were what framed
[1:30:35] by what the word of God so whatever
[1:30:38] happened here was frame or manufactured
[1:30:42] by God so God was standing and making
[1:30:45] the
[1:30:49] Earth are we together he was was framed
[1:30:52] by the word of God so that the things
[1:30:55] which are what seen were not made of
[1:30:58] things that do what which do appear so
[1:31:01] this Earth that you see today started
[1:31:04] from an
[1:31:06] abstract it started from an invisible
[1:31:09] work it started from a concept in the
[1:31:13] mind of God and when God as a great
[1:31:17] architect designed the Earth he spoke it
[1:31:20] and then the Earth came to
[1:31:23] existence are we together so everything
[1:31:26] that existed in the Earth come from the
[1:31:28] water word so if you want to create you

[1:39:06] request we clear givers is a request
[1:39:11] somebody is
[1:39:13] asking amen and somebody's demanding
[1:39:18] something amen it's a request a men but
[1:39:22] the Bible says give us this day it is
[1:39:27] not just any

[1:41:04] layer my friend when we mean ours means
[1:41:07] that it is your
[1:41:09] belonging it is something that already
[1:41:12] belonged to you and you are just
[1:41:15] claiming
[1:41:17] it because you should have said give me
[1:41:21] this day a bread then we know it's not
[1:41:24] your bread but when you come back you
[1:41:26] say give me this day my car so that car
[1:41:29] was originally mine
[1:41:32] amen hallelujah everybody okay amen it
[1:41:36] looks like the one requesting is only
[1:41:39] asking something that already belong to
[1:41:42] [Music]

[1:41:48] day is the day is the due

[1:42:02] something out of

[1:42:08] together amen give us this day our our
[1:42:12] what Daily Bread so this bread is given
[1:42:16] not every
[1:42:19] day it is the bread of the
[1:42:23] day it is a portion specific for that
[1:42:27] day are you following me are you
[1:42:30] following me have I lost somebody it is
[1:42:32] the bread of one
[1:42:38] day Have I Lost somebody give us
[1:42:41] somebody's asking somebody's requesting
[1:42:44] somebody's demanding give us which day
[1:42:46] tomorrow not this day limited I mean
[1:42:49] that day it's in the
[1:42:52] present amen give me this day today give
[1:42:55] me this day this day what hour something
[1:42:58] that already belonged to me amen and
[1:43:01] give me this day our what Daily Bread so
[1:43:04] this bread comes usually automatic per
[1:43:11] day are we together are we together now
[1:43:16] when you go back to M uh to Luke Luke
[1:43:19] say also give
[1:43:21] and we know give us it means somebody's
[1:43:24] requesting we know ours means that it's
[1:43:27] ownership we know daily means that it's
[1:43:30] one day but we see look here interpret
[1:43:33] it a little bit
[1:43:36] different Luke says not give us this
[1:43:40] day amen amen because Matthew deal with
[1:43:44] the present time
[1:43:46] only are you following me but Luke is
[1:43:49] saying give me day by day in other word
[1:43:55] look is not limited to the present
[1:44:01] time are we together Luke give you the
[1:44:05] hope that whatever happened today will
[1:44:09] also happen tomorrow
[1:44:11] amen are we together are we together are
[1:44:15] we together so look because yesterday
[1:44:19] was a day that's right
[1:44:24] amen yesterday was a day today is a day
[1:44:29] tomorrow is a day so when Luke say give
[1:44:33] me day by day Luke is covering the
[1:44:43] Past come on yeah come on come on come
[1:44:45] on come on L is covering the past and
[1:44:49] the what present and the what future
[1:44:51] because Jesus Christ is the same
[1:44:54] yesterday today and
[1:44:57] [Applause]
[1:45:00] forever are we together are we together
[1:45:03] so L it's talking about a full
[1:45:09] Providence for the
[1:45:11] past for the
[1:45:13] present and for the future which
[1:45:17] is I mean in what compatible with
[1:45:21] Hebrew 1338 in other word Luke is saying
[1:45:25] whatever happened
[1:45:28] yesterday it's guaranteed for
[1:45:31] today amen and it's also guaranteed for
[1:45:36] tomorrow but usually yesterday is a
[1:45:41] history yesterday don't scare you
[1:45:44] anymore because whatever happened
[1:45:46] yesterday is sealed what concern you it
[1:45:50] is what what is happening today and
[1:45:52] what's going to happen where tomorrow
[1:45:55] but look now since the p is a history
[1:45:59] amen look now take care of our
[1:46:05] future are we together that this bread
[1:46:10] is not just a bread of a day it is a
[1:46:13] bread that will also happen
[1:46:18] tomorrow everybody okay and it's a bread
[1:46:22] that is daily amen listen a little bit
[1:46:25] to this in the Book of Matthew chapter 6
[1:46:29] verse 34 Jesus say take no thought for
[1:46:32] what

[1:46:38] is history whatever happened yesterday
[1:46:40] is gone whatever happened on the day of

[1:46:44] picture we are no more anxious about
[1:46:47] Thanksgiving is coming Thanksgiving is

[1:46:57] tension that is what is building your
[1:46:59] anxiety now when Luke say give us day by
[1:47:03] day Luke is taking care of the past of
[1:47:07] the present and he's releasing us from
[1:47:10] the anxiety of
[1:47:14] tomorrow are we together Jesus say take
[1:47:19] therefore no thought for what tomorrow
[1:47:21] in other words do not worry about
