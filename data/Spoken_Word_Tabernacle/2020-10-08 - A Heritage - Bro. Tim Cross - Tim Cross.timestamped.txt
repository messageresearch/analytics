[44:11] but
[44:12] it was a a wonderful atmosphere of
[44:14] worship
[44:15] here this evening and so it just felt
[44:17] like the lord was maybe
[44:20] leading me down a different path so
[44:21] we're going to follow the leadership of
[44:24] the lord but
[44:25] we'll read from uh psalm chapter 61
[44:31] all eight of these verses and uh

[45:38] the
[45:39] tears from her eyes and with the hairs
[45:42] of her head lord
[45:43] as she lord opened up a fountain of
[45:46] praise

[46:43] of their situation lord whatever they're

[46:56] we ask it in jesus name we pray amen
[47:00] amen psalm chapter 61 will
[47:03] begin reading at verse number one
[47:12] hear my cry o god attend unto my prayer
[47:18] from the end of the earth will i cry
[47:21] unto thee
[47:22] when my heart is overwhelmed lead me to
[47:25] the rock
[47:26] that is higher than i am for thou
[47:29] hast been a shelter for me and a strong
[47:32] tower from the enemy
[47:34] i will abide in thy tabernacle forever
[47:39] i will trust in the covert of thy wings
[47:42] for thou o god hast heard my vows
[47:46] thou hast given me the heritage
[47:49] of those that fear thy name
[47:52] amen thou will prolong the king's life
[47:55] and his years
[47:56] as many generations he shall abide
[47:59] before god forever
[48:01] all prepare mercy and truth which may
[48:04] preserve him so will i sing praise
[48:08] unto thy name forever that i may daily
[48:11] perform my vows
[48:13] amen may the lord bless the reading of
[48:14] his word and you could be seated tonight
[48:17] there is a verse in this psalm tonight
[48:20] that
[48:20] i want to just focus in on and use it
[48:24] for a thought and for a text verse
[48:26] number five where he says
[48:28] thou o god has heard my vows and then he
[48:31] says this
[48:32] thou hast given me the heritage
[48:36] of those that fear thy name
[48:39] amen what a what a wonderful heritage
[48:42] and of course
[48:43] this was not just for david i believe
[48:46] this is for every son and daughter of
[48:48] god
[48:49] amen i i believe that this is all this
[48:52] is a place where every one of us
[48:54] at some point in our christian journey
[48:56] we come to the same realization david
[48:58] did
[48:59] so i want to speak tonight on our
[49:01] heritage and i'd like to
[49:03] maybe just take a moment that to
[49:05] describe uh what a heritage
[49:07] is there there are a number of
[49:09] definitions
[49:10] but one is property that descends
[49:14] to an heir amen another one is
[49:17] something that is transmitted by or
[49:21] acquired
[49:22] from a predecessor amen someone who has
[49:25] gone before you
[49:27] amen has handed something down to you
[49:30] amen and uh another is a tradition
[49:35] and then the a third definition is
[49:38] something that is possessed
[49:40] as a result of one's natural situation
[49:44] or birth amen a birthright
[49:48] amen is another example of a heritage
[49:51] uh you know my last name is cross and
[49:54] and we've got different ones in here
[49:56] tonight brother shock and
[49:59] uh just different ones i brother foul be
[50:02] different ones
[50:03] uh you all have a last name and that's
[50:06] the name that you go by you probably
[50:08] got that from your father and there
[50:10] there are
[50:11] uh there are traits there are
[50:13] characteristics there are things about
[50:15] you that make you
[50:16] unique uh and it's a blend of things
[50:19] that came from both your father and your
[50:21] mother
[50:22] and so i i'm across tonight and and i
[50:25] want to tell you
[50:27] uh as a member of the cross family
[50:30] there are things about me that are
[50:33] a natural result of the heritage
[50:36] that i was born into amen these are
[50:40] things that i did not have to be taught
[50:42] how to do amen i didn't i didn't have to
[50:45] go to school
[50:46] to learn these things amen in fact if i
[50:49] need to go to school at all
[50:50] to get some of this out of me you
[50:52] understand but but it's something
[50:54] that's in me as a result of my birth
[50:57] i remember when i was just a little boy
[50:58] i was i was visiting my grandmother
[51:00] in her home there my mom's mother and i
[51:03] was walking down the hall and
[51:05] my dad's most people him larry and she
[51:08] was watching me walk down the hall
[51:10] with my back turned to her and she said
[51:13] little larry
[51:15] little larry and oh it made me so proud
[51:19] it made me so proud that she would see
[51:21] something in me
[51:23] that reminded her of my father
[51:26] it was just something about the way i
[51:28] was walking brother carlos
[51:30] that put her in mind of my dad and i
[51:32] thought you know
[51:33] i wasn't even conscious
[51:36] i wasn't thinking about it amen i wasn't
[51:40] trying to do anything
[51:42] i i was just walking down the hall but
[51:44] something about the way i walked
[51:47] reminded her of who my father is and she
[51:50] could see my father
[51:52] walking in me amen and so i i think when
[51:55] that applies to the spiritual amen
[51:58] there's a heritage that comes to each of
[52:01] us
[52:02] as a result of the new birth amen it's
[52:04] not something
[52:05] we didn't learn this because of the
[52:07] message
[52:09] we didn't learn this because of the
[52:10] church that you belong to
[52:12] you didn't learn this because of who
[52:14] your pastor is
[52:16] i mean you didn't learn this because of
[52:17] your skin color
[52:19] or your culture or your race or any even
[52:22] your background
[52:22] amen it's a background that goes higher
[52:25] than your natural background that's for
[52:27] sure
[52:28] but because of the new birth there are
[52:30] certain traits
[52:31] and there are certain tendencies amen
[52:33] that are part of your genetic it's part
[52:35] of your dna
[52:36] amen because of your birth and so
[52:39] david somehow he reached a place
[52:43] in his walk with the lord where he can
[52:45] make this testimony amen he said
[52:47] thou hast given me the heritage
[52:51] of those that fear thy name
[52:54] amen it's a shared heritage amen it's
[52:58] something david did not begin
[53:00] and he was not going to end amen but but
[53:03] he could look
[53:04] back down through history and he could
[53:07] see with moses
[53:09] and the children of israel and and the
[53:11] forefathers before him amen
[53:13] there were some common traits and some
[53:15] common characteristics
[53:17] maybe it was a reaction to a challenge
[53:21] i mean maybe it was the way he handled a
[53:24] situation
[53:25] and maybe it was a test or maybe it was
[53:27] a trial
[53:28] but that particular set of circumstances
[53:31] brought out
[53:32] a a a reaction a behavior
[53:35] amen to a certain uh just a way of
[53:37] dealing with things
[53:39] and they would begin to realize ah
[53:41] that's not me
[53:44] that didn't come from jesse that didn't
[53:47] come from my natural father
[53:50] oh my amen i'm thinking about a time
[53:54] david went down on the battlefield to
[53:55] take some supplies
[53:57] to his brothers amen and there's all of
[54:00] his natural family
[54:02] there's all of his brothers there
[54:05] and they were watching they were
[54:06] reacting to this giant
[54:08] philistine they would come out every
[54:10] morning and make fun of their god
[54:13] and all of david's brothers were afraid
[54:16] now they had the military training they
[54:19] had the uniform
[54:21] they had the weapons amen they had all
[54:24] of the resources
[54:26] but evidently they did not have the same
[54:28] experiences
[54:30] that david had oh my
[54:35] amen they should have been reacting like
[54:37] soldiers
[54:39] but they were reacting like cowards and
[54:42] david had a different reaction
[54:44] oh my because he was connected to
[54:47] another heritage
[54:49] amen that was greater than this soul
[54:51] flesh right here
[54:52] oh my it was greater than flesh and
[54:55] blood
[54:56] oh i want to tell you friends serving
[54:58] god is not a flesh and blood affair
[55:00] doesn't matter who your father is who
[55:02] your mother is
[55:03] who your siblings are i mean it doesn't
[55:06] matter what your neighborhood is
[55:08] it doesn't matter what political party
[55:10] you belong to that has nothing to do
[55:12] with your christian heritage oh my it's
[55:15] a bloodline that comes from the almighty
[55:17] god
[55:19] amen hallelujah
[55:22] oh my friend i pray god will help us
[55:26] tonight
[55:27] to look up our family tree and recognize
[55:30] there's some common traits
[55:32] i mean there's some things we share in
[55:34] common with our forefathers
[55:36] amen one time when i was just
[55:40] a uh eight nine ten years old maybe a
[55:42] little older maybe a 12 or 13 i was
[55:44] going with my dad and his dad and
[55:48] two of my brothers we were all in the
[55:49] car we were going to a fishing trip
[55:53] and we were going down the road and my
[55:55] granddad began to tell a story
[55:57] and he told about a time he was at a
[55:59] family reunion
[56:01] i wasn't there but he was there and and
[56:04] you know at the family reunion
[56:05] everyone's
[56:06] uh just enjoying each other's company
[56:09] they were eating and
[56:10] drinking and and having a good time
[56:12] together the
[56:13] the cross family but he said one of the
[56:16] relatives i believe his name was
[56:18] uncle john he said he was he was uh
[56:21] he was sitting in a wheelchair and
[56:23] someone began to ask him said uncle john
[56:25] said what's wrong
[56:27] what's wrong with you is there something
[56:29] wrong
[56:31] because he was crying they saw tears
[56:34] coming out of his eyes
[56:35] and and one of the other relatives they
[56:38] said oh there's nothing wrong with him
[56:40] he said don't you know said all crosses
[56:43] cry they said when they're when they're
[56:46] happy
[56:47] they cry so there's nothing wrong with
[56:51] him at all he's just
[56:52] enjoying the the fellowship and the
[56:55] company
[56:55] and the atmosphere that he's a part of
[56:57] said all
[56:58] crosses cry when they're happy
[57:02] well i never forgot that story because
[57:06] brother shimbo it helped me to
[57:09] understand
[57:10] something about myself
[57:13] amen because when i would be in church
[57:16] and the holy spirit would be moving
[57:18] some would be shouting some would be
[57:21] dancing some would be
[57:23] running amen some would be speaking in
[57:25] tongues
[57:26] there were all men of reactions but all
[57:28] i could do was cry
[57:31] i wanted to run and i wanted to shout
[57:34] i wanted to express myself some other
[57:37] way but it just all just comes right out
[57:39] in my eyes
[57:41] all the joy and all the all the all the
[57:43] wonderful feeling amen
[57:44] it just comes right out of my eyes and
[57:46] all i can do is crying
[57:47] and wipe my eyes but see understanding
[57:51] the heritage
[57:55] amen understanding where i came from
[57:59] and who i am amen it helped me to no
[58:02] longer be ashamed
[58:05] [Music]
[58:06] when i realized this is just my heritage
[58:10] i mean this runs in my family amen this
[58:14] was before i was even
[58:15] born this trait was already
[58:19] all coming down to me amen and so i
[58:22] inherited this so i don't have to be
[58:24] ashamed of myself
[58:26] because it's who i am oh
[58:29] my i think about of one of our
[58:31] forefathers
[58:32] when he and about 119 other believers
[58:35] came
[58:36] staggering out of the upper room amen
[58:38] the world said what meeteth this
[58:41] and peter said these men are not drunk
[58:43] as you suppose
[58:44] seeing is but the third hour of the day
[58:47] but this is that
[58:49] this is that that was spoken by the
[58:52] prophet joel
[58:53] in the last days i'll pour out my spirit
[58:55] upon all flesh amen
[58:58] what was peter doing he was connecting
[59:00] to his heritage
[59:03] amen all only days before
[59:07] he was ashamed to be identified as a
[59:09] disciple of christ
[59:11] i'm not one of them no sir he cursed
[59:14] he swore he denied the lord jesus he
[59:18] denied being one of his chosen
[59:20] but here just days later amen after the
[59:23] holy spirit
[59:24] came and filled him
[59:28] it connected him to his spiritual
[59:30] heritage
[59:31] and he recognized i don't have to be
[59:33] ashamed of this i don't
[59:35] have to apologize for this this is who i
[59:39] am this has been going on since before
[59:42] time began
[59:43] when the morning stars sing together and
[59:45] the sons of god shouted for joy
[59:48] amen peter connected to his spiritual
[59:50] heritage
[59:52] and he identified amen he identified his
[59:55] present-day conduct
[59:57] as a fulfillment of a prophecy
[1:00:01] i believe that's what the holy ghost
[1:00:03] does when the holy ghost begins to live
[1:00:05] through you amen
[1:00:06] you can you can identify your life by
[1:00:10] the word
[1:00:11] amen and you won't have to be ashamed of
[1:00:13] it you won't have to apologize for it
[1:00:16] you won't have to try to reinvent
[1:00:17] yourself because what you realize it's
[1:00:19] the word
[1:00:20] living itself out through your members
[1:00:23] even creating your conduct
[1:00:25] and enabling you to handle the
[1:00:27] situations in that way
[1:00:29] oh my amen
[1:00:32] so david began to realize he had unusual
[1:00:36] traits
[1:00:36] that were different from others he did
[1:00:40] not
[1:00:40] run from a challenge amen he did not
[1:00:44] compromise when pressure was applied
[1:00:48] he could not bear to hear someone mock
[1:00:51] the god that he served
[1:00:53] amen you know something else about david
[1:00:55] i really love
[1:00:56] he got happy when he saw the word of god
[1:00:59] being restored
[1:01:01] [Music]
[1:01:03] amen yes he was a king he was the
[1:01:06] highest leader in the land
[1:01:08] he had all kinds of royal
[1:01:10] responsibilities
[1:01:12] he had he he wore dignified clothes he
[1:01:14] lived in a dignified home
[1:01:16] he had all kind of people around him
[1:01:20] amen and you know a man who is a king
[1:01:23] tries to conduct himself like a king
[1:01:26] so he tries to walk a certain way hold
[1:01:28] himself a certain way
[1:01:30] greet the people a certain way he just
[1:01:32] wants to behave like a king
[1:01:34] but one day david saw something that was
[1:01:36] even more important than himself
[1:01:39] he saw the ark coming back
[1:01:42] to the place amen where it belonged
[1:01:45] it had been down in the enemy camp and
[1:01:47] then it had been up at a man's house
[1:01:49] for years and that man's home was
[1:01:51] receiving the blessings of that
[1:01:53] but david was seeing the word amen come
[1:01:55] back into its rightful place
[1:01:58] into its rightful position with the
[1:02:00] blessings of god
[1:02:01] and david begins shouting david began
[1:02:04] dancing
[1:02:04] he began rejoicing amen why because he
[1:02:08] identified in that word
[1:02:11] amen there is our victory
[1:02:15] there is our delivering power there is
[1:02:17] our overcoming power
[1:02:18] there is what makes israel the fear of
[1:02:21] all the other nations
[1:02:23] and david recognized if it weren't for
[1:02:25] that word
[1:02:26] i would be nothing amen oh my so he was
[1:02:30] happy
[1:02:31] you know something when you really get
[1:02:32] caught up in the spirit of god
[1:02:34] you don't worry about what other people
[1:02:35] think david threw off his kingly
[1:02:38] garments
[1:02:39] and he just danced with all his mind
[1:02:41] before the lord
[1:02:42] oh my you know his his uh
[1:02:46] his wife that was given to him by saul
[1:02:49] michael i believe was her name or
[1:02:51] michelle she she said
[1:02:53] oh david she rebuked him
[1:02:56] she tried to make him ashamed of his
[1:02:59] behavior because it embarrassed her
[1:03:02] it embarrassed her amen but david never
[1:03:05] backed up
[1:03:07] oh my god oh if you only understood what
[1:03:10] you married into
[1:03:16] this runs uh this runs in my family
[1:03:20] you ever heard somebody say that he
[1:03:22] can't help it
[1:03:23] she can't help it that runs in the
[1:03:25] family
[1:03:27] if you knew his father if you knew his
[1:03:29] uncle if you knew his grandparents
[1:03:31] if you knew the history of his family
[1:03:34] you would understand amen
[1:03:35] he can't even help it he is that way
[1:03:38] because of his heritage and david said
[1:03:42] i want to tell you something sweetheart
[1:03:45] he said if you thought that was
[1:03:46] something
[1:03:50] wait till the next time
[1:03:56] oh my amen wait till
[1:04:00] the great conqueror comes knocking on
[1:04:02] the door of paradise
[1:04:05] to loose the saints of the old testament
[1:04:08] amen wait till the new testament bride
[1:04:11] is is
[1:04:12] resurrected and raptured and we meet him
[1:04:14] in the skies

[1:04:18] see me dance

[1:04:22] didn't he didn't back away
[1:04:24] he said i'm going to dance more so i'm
[1:04:26] going to praise the lord with more
[1:04:28] energy than before
[1:04:29] with more zeal amen david was not
[1:04:33] perfect but he was quick to repent
[1:04:37] [Music]
[1:04:38] amen it runs in the family
[1:04:42] no no none of us are perfect but when we
[1:04:44] realize we've been wrong and the holy
[1:04:46] spirit brings conviction
[1:04:48] quickly amen lord jesus i'm sorry
[1:04:51] please forgive me father god that runs
[1:04:54] in the family
[1:04:55] amen david also said this
[1:04:59] something else that runs in the family
[1:05:02] i was glad when they said unto me
[1:05:07] let us go into the house of the lord
[1:05:11] amen it just runs in the family
[1:05:14] for christians to want to go to church
[1:05:17] they love together with saints that like
[1:05:20] precious faith
[1:05:21] and sing the songs of zion and praise
[1:05:24] god
[1:05:24] and hear the word preach the prophet of
[1:05:27] god said if the love of god is in your
[1:05:29] heart
[1:05:30] you can hardly wait for those church
[1:05:32] doors to open
[1:05:34] oh my just runs in the family

[1:05:47] all the days of my life to behold the
[1:05:50] beauty of the lord
[1:05:52] and to inquire in his temple
[1:05:55] you know i believe brother shimbo that
[1:05:57] is not a a building
[1:05:59] what david was speaking of was not a
[1:06:02] natural tabernacle
[1:06:04] or a physical place but i believe it was
[1:06:07] a spiritual position
[1:06:10] it was a place amen david said now
[1:06:12] prepare a table before me in the
[1:06:14] presence
[1:06:15] of my enemies you can be in any
[1:06:18] surrounding
[1:06:20] you can be in any situation you can be
[1:06:23] completely
[1:06:24] entrapped by the enemy and yet you can
[1:06:27] be in this spiritual place
[1:06:30] just like our brother was speaking about
[1:06:32] amen when death was at the door there
[1:06:34] was peace
[1:06:36] amen there was a peace there why it's a
[1:06:38] spiritual place
[1:06:40] in the time of trouble he shall hide me
[1:06:44] amen and the secret of his pavilion
[1:06:47] he shall set me up upon a rock
[1:06:51] amen all these things that are taking
[1:06:53] place around us with
[1:06:54] with the diseases with the plagues with
[1:06:57] the pestilences
[1:06:58] whatever it may be amen political
[1:07:00] pressure amen everything is collapsing
[1:07:03] in the world around us
[1:07:04] all it's doing is creating i mean it's
[1:07:07] it's creating the circumstances
[1:07:09] it's it's just setting the stage
[1:07:13] for the bride to be sealed completely
[1:07:17] amen to be encapsulated when you can't
[1:07:20] depend on your government and you can't
[1:07:22] depend on your insurance
[1:07:24] and you can't depend on your paycheck oh
[1:07:27] my
[1:07:28] amen when you get to the place where god
[1:07:31] is all you have
[1:07:32] then you recognize he's all i need
[1:07:37] amen there's a secret place hallelujah
[1:07:41] he's still jehovah jireh he's still
[1:07:43] jehovah rapha
[1:07:45] he's still jehovah he's still jehovah's
[1:07:48] thinking

[1:07:52] he steal those things
[1:07:56] hallelujah oh i feel good but you know
[1:07:59] how he got all those names
[1:08:02] was when his children got into
[1:08:03] situations

[1:08:10] deliverer
[1:08:11] i'm your savior i'm your almighty god
[1:08:14] then they gave him a new name a new
[1:08:17] title
[1:08:18] he's my peace he's my salvation
[1:08:22] amen he's my rapture he's my healing
[1:08:26] hallelujah he's my victory he's my joy
[1:08:29] amen it becomes personal then
[1:08:33] it becomes personal to him hallelujah
[1:08:38] oh my i don't have to go to church to be
[1:08:42] in that place

[1:08:46] job
[1:08:47] at home amen oh in the courtroom
[1:08:50] wherever the circumstances whatever the
[1:08:53] surroundings amen
[1:08:54] i can stay and abide in this temple
[1:08:59] [Applause]
[1:09:01] amen our heritage tonight heritage can
[1:09:06] be lost
[1:09:08] if it is forgotten and a heritage can be
[1:09:13] lost if it is abandoned
[1:09:17] god told israel to mark the places
[1:09:21] where they crossed jordan with piles of
[1:09:24] stones
[1:09:25] as reminders and he said
[1:09:28] tell it to your children and to their
[1:09:32] children
[1:09:34] if we move away from the landmarks
[1:09:39] we will lose our heritage
[1:09:43] if we forget the things that god has
[1:09:45] done for us
[1:09:47] amen and we forget the path amen that
[1:09:50] the message
[1:09:51] came to us and we forget the instruments
[1:09:54] or the vessels that god has
[1:09:56] used to make his word available to us
[1:10:00] amen as satan can get you to abandon
[1:10:02] those landmarks
[1:10:04] he will change the course amen he will
[1:10:08] change your path
[1:10:09] amen to a destination of destruction
[1:10:13] so moses commanded the children of
[1:10:15] israel joshua actually come in and said
[1:10:17] i want you to make piles of stones in
[1:10:19] that jordan river
[1:10:20] amen where you crossed over and where
[1:10:22] god gave the victory
[1:10:25] amen and he said i want you to remind
[1:10:27] your children
[1:10:28] and remind their children bring them
[1:10:31] back
[1:10:32] to these stones bring them back to this
[1:10:35] place
[1:10:36] it's a physical marker of something god
[1:10:39] did for you amen now the children
[1:10:43] the children were not alive when it
[1:10:45] happened they weren't there they weren't
[1:10:47] present to have experienced it he said
[1:10:49] that doesn't matter
[1:10:50] you take them back to what god did
[1:10:54] and when they can begin to see your
[1:10:57] appreciation
[1:11:00] for the realities of god in your life
[1:11:04] it will develop an appreciation with
[1:11:06] them
[1:11:07] for the same god and they will lead them
[1:11:10] to their own
[1:11:12] personal experience where they too
[1:11:15] can develop landmarks amen what's your
[1:11:18] landmark tonight
[1:11:20] it's a testimony something god has done
[1:11:24] for you where you know he rolled back
[1:11:27] the waters of the sea
[1:11:28] i mean you know that was supernatural
[1:11:30] you know that was god coming to your
[1:11:32] rescue
[1:11:33] amen we'll pile some stones up right
[1:11:35] there
[1:11:36] because you're going to come back to
[1:11:37] that amen sometimes you need to be
[1:11:40] reminded of that
[1:11:41] even sometimes you need to recall the
[1:11:44] things that god has done
[1:11:45] in your life sometimes we grow
[1:11:47] discouraged we grow weak amen our faith
[1:11:49] seems to dwindle
[1:11:50] we need to go back to all the things god
[1:11:53] has done for
[1:11:54] us amen take the devil back there
[1:12:00] tell the devil that's not just a pile of
[1:12:02] stones
[1:12:04] i'm a changed person and right here's
[1:12:06] where it happened
[1:12:08] i know what god did for me right here
[1:12:11] amen
[1:12:12] and i'm not moving away from it
[1:12:17] amen i was uh i haven't been able to
[1:12:21] verify the source
[1:12:23] of this or the actual whether or not
[1:12:26] it's actually true
[1:12:27] so i want to say that before i tell you
[1:12:28] this tonight but somewhere down through
[1:12:31] the years i heard
[1:12:32] someone share a testimony that brother
[1:12:35] branham
[1:12:36] had gone in his in his lifetime out to
[1:12:39] an area he was either the u.s or canada
[1:12:42] and he came in contact with a tribe of
[1:12:44] indians
[1:12:46] and he ministered there but these
[1:12:49] indians were in a predicament
[1:12:51] because they had forgotten they had lost
[1:12:54] their lineage their ancestry
[1:12:58] they could not trace it and as a result
[1:13:01] of that
[1:13:01] they could not make claims to
[1:13:04] own and to receive like a land grant or
[1:13:07] to
[1:13:08] actually be given a a possession by
[1:13:11] the national government but
[1:13:15] through the gift of the holy spirit
[1:13:18] through the gift of discernment
[1:13:20] the prophet of god was able to help them
[1:13:22] identify
[1:13:24] who their ancestors were
[1:13:27] and it held up in the court of law it
[1:13:30] was it was absolutely the truth
[1:13:32] and so they would they took note of the
[1:13:34] things the prophet of god told them and
[1:13:35] they went and they completed the
[1:13:37] documents
[1:13:38] they completed the documentation
[1:13:40] submitted it to the government
[1:13:41] and they were given their inheritance
[1:13:44] they were given a permanent possession
[1:13:46] amen
[1:13:48] because the holy spirit was able to
[1:13:50] identify
[1:13:51] their heritage and i thought you know
[1:13:53] that's wonderful even in the natural
[1:13:56] but there was something far greater in
[1:13:57] the spiritually man
[1:13:59] oh my the prophet of god in the ministry
[1:14:02] of this
[1:14:02] hour amen was able to trace our lineage
[1:14:06] hallelujah all the way back to calgary
[1:14:10] amen and said you never did it in the
[1:14:14] first place
[1:14:15] you never sinned in the first place amen
[1:14:18] and that property that the devil's been
[1:14:20] squatting on
[1:14:22] and trying to keep you off of here is
[1:14:25] your legal deed here's your abstract
[1:14:28] title d go possess your land
[1:14:31] take your healing take your salvation

[1:14:37] ones amen
[1:14:39] hallelujah give you the faith and the
[1:14:42] courage amen devil you can't stand on my
[1:14:45] property
[1:14:46] any longer it's mine by the baptism of
[1:14:48] the holy ghost

[1:15:02] oh my god praise the lord

[1:15:40] but you've got the need

[1:15:57] and he's here in the form of the
[1:15:58] revealed word and if you can accept it
[1:16:01] by faith

[1:16:06] it in jesus name amen

[1:16:16] what about this one's missing look who's
[1:16:18] here quit worrying about who's missing
[1:16:21] and look at who's present with us amen
[1:16:24] oh
[1:16:25] my friends jesus is here the holy spirit
[1:16:28] is here
[1:16:29] victory is here amen we've got the
[1:16:32] victory tonight
[1:16:34] amen praise the lord it's our heritage
[1:16:38] tonight
[1:16:40] amen it's your heritage tonight
[1:16:44] amen our heritage is is something that
[1:16:46] is
[1:16:47] passed down from a predecessor
[1:16:51] what what could be more wonderful you
[1:16:54] know
[1:16:55] i thought about this and i in in my
[1:16:58] family there are
[1:17:00] seven children i have four brothers and
[1:17:04] two sisters and my dad is not really a
[1:17:07] wealthy man
[1:17:09] part of the reason is because he had so
[1:17:11] many kids
[1:17:13] and he worked for the post post service
[1:17:15] and and that
[1:17:16] has plenty trust me but he's not
[1:17:19] you know a millionaire or something like
[1:17:21] that so
[1:17:23] if my dad ever passes he'll
[1:17:26] give away his home his vehicles
[1:17:30] his motorcycles his guns
[1:17:34] you know whatever those things that he
[1:17:36] owns will be distributed
[1:17:38] amongst the children the siblings but
[1:17:41] you know i'm
[1:17:42] i might have his very best
[1:17:45] gun or his very best
[1:17:48] whatever but you know to have that
[1:17:53] wouldn't be him
[1:17:56] and i could enjoy that and say i'm
[1:17:58] thankful
[1:17:59] [Music]
[1:18:00] for something that belonged to him
[1:18:04] to remember him by but it's not him
[1:18:09] well on the other hand as sons and
[1:18:12] daughters of god
[1:18:15] we've got an inheritance and jesus said
[1:18:19] it's expedient for you in the physical
[1:18:22] form a man jesus told his disciples
[1:18:26] it's expedient for you that i go away
[1:18:31] for if i go not away the comforter will
[1:18:33] not come
[1:18:34] but if i go away i'll sin the comforter
[1:18:38] and when he the holy ghost is come it'll
[1:18:41] lead
[1:18:41] you and guide you into
[1:18:45] all truth so when
[1:18:49] when jesus gives his children an
[1:18:51] inheritance
[1:18:52] he's not giving us something that he
[1:18:54] used to own
[1:18:58] or even a a part of his possession
[1:19:02] but his inheritance to you is himself
[1:19:08] he's coming in a form and he can be with
[1:19:11] you and you
[1:19:12] and you and you and you and all
[1:19:16] of his children amen have the promise
[1:19:19] of his abiding presence and
[1:19:22] power with the believer
[1:19:28] oh my he gave us something
[1:19:31] better than his physical presence
[1:19:35] as much as we would love to see the lord
[1:19:37] jesus walk into this room tonight with
[1:19:39] sandals on
[1:19:40] and a galilean robot and long
[1:19:43] shoulder-length air
[1:19:44] and a statue of a man there's something
[1:19:47] greater
[1:19:49] you've got something better than that
[1:19:52] and that is the holy spirit
[1:19:55] he said it's expedient for you it's
[1:19:58] better for you and when he left
[1:20:03] the better king now i long for the day
[1:20:06] we can worship at his feet
[1:20:09] but what's going to take you there what
[1:20:12] is going to lead you and guide you into
[1:20:14] all truth
[1:20:16] what is going to lead you and guide you
[1:20:17] into the full manifestation
[1:20:20] of the sons and daughters of god the
[1:20:22] holy spirit
[1:20:24] where you too will recognize one day my
[1:20:26] these actions aren't my old
[1:20:28] this is not the old me this is not the
[1:20:30] old us
[1:20:32] you know this is a new this is a new
[1:20:34] life living
[1:20:35] on the inside of me as adopted sons and
[1:20:37] daughters of god
[1:20:38] you're going to be able to recognize i
[1:20:41] am the son and daughter of god
[1:20:43] amen and you you begin connecting with
[1:20:46] your heritage
[1:20:50] that's why i say i think peter is such a
[1:20:52] good example of that
[1:20:54] because i only know of two things peter
[1:20:56] said right
[1:20:58] prior to the day of pentecost and that
[1:21:01] was
[1:21:01] to whom shall we go lord for thou alone
[1:21:04] has the words of eternal life that was
[1:21:06] good
[1:21:07] and then he said thou art the christ the
[1:21:09] son of the living god
[1:21:10] that's the only two things peter said
[1:21:12] right and even after he said
[1:21:14] that jesus had to rebuke him because he
[1:21:17] said
[1:21:17] not so lord and peter and jesus said get
[1:21:20] behind me satan for thou
[1:21:22] savrus not the things of god but the
[1:21:24] things of men but
[1:21:25] after the inheritance came after the
[1:21:29] heritage was passed down
[1:21:31] everything peter said god punctuated it
[1:21:34] with power
[1:21:37] they came to the lame man at the gate
[1:21:38] called beautiful amen he said
[1:21:40] silver and gold how about none but he
[1:21:42] said look on us
[1:21:44] look on us amen he wasn't saying looking
[1:21:46] on me peter
[1:21:47] you say look look who i've become amen
[1:21:50] look it's the power it's the life of
[1:21:51] jesus christ
[1:21:53] he knew he was sharing an inheritance
[1:21:56] that he could not
[1:21:57] he could not uh expend he could not give
[1:22:00] it all away
[1:22:01] he could not heal too many people amen
[1:22:03] there was there was never going to run
[1:22:05] out of this abundant supply
[1:22:07] of holy ghost power oh my but such as i
[1:22:11] have
[1:22:11] i give unto thee in the name of jesus
[1:22:14] rise up and walk
[1:22:18] amen behold what manner of love the
[1:22:21] father hath bestowed upon us
[1:22:24] us that we should be called the sons of
[1:22:28] god
[1:22:30] now let me tell you something about your
[1:22:31] family heritage
[1:22:33] therefore the world knoweth us
[1:22:37] not because it knew
[1:22:41] him not if you are misunderstood by the
[1:22:45] world
[1:22:46] welcome to the family that's part
[1:22:49] of the family heritage
[1:22:53] so you got to understand amen it didn't
[1:22:55] recognize him
[1:22:57] and it's not going to recognize him in
[1:22:58] the bride form today
[1:23:01] amen beloved now are we the sons of god
[1:23:05] and it does not yet appear what we shall
[1:23:07] be but we know that when he shall appear
[1:23:10] we shall be like him for we shall see
[1:23:13] him
[1:23:14] as he is and every man that hath his
[1:23:17] hope
[1:23:17] in him purifies himself even as
[1:23:21] he is pure we can look up
[1:23:24] our family tree tonight and we can
[1:23:27] identify the characteristics
[1:23:29] of our ancestors and as the royal seat
[1:23:32] of abraham
[1:23:34] we've got a lot to be proud of
[1:23:37] as a cross i i don't have a whole lot to
[1:23:39] be
[1:23:40] to brag about but as a son of god
[1:23:44] i don't have anything to be ashamed of
[1:23:46] amen
[1:23:48] men like daniel who prayed
[1:23:52] when it was illegal
[1:23:56] when they put a national ban on prayer
[1:24:01] that you know daniel
[1:24:05] [Music]
[1:24:07] he could have handled things a little
[1:24:08] differently
[1:24:10] did he did he have to go
[1:24:14] and throw the windows open
[1:24:19] [Music]
[1:24:20] and and really from you know
[1:24:23] deep within his vocal cords and just as
[1:24:26] with
[1:24:27] all the energy praise the lord
[1:24:31] oh jehovah thank you god for another day
[1:24:37] amen the bible says
[1:24:40] daniel prayed as before
[1:24:45] amen legislation does not
[1:24:49] impact the believer's connection
[1:24:53] with god amen
[1:24:57] because once you realize the source of
[1:24:59] your victory
[1:25:00] is the strength of your connection
[1:25:03] you will not let anything tamper with
[1:25:06] that connection
[1:25:08] and daniel said law or no law king or no
[1:25:11] king legislation or no legislation
[1:25:14] i'm gonna pray amen and i'm gonna let
[1:25:16] god
[1:25:17] handle the results
[1:25:20] amen oh my friend
[1:25:25] he just prayed he just prayed uh
[1:25:28] it didn't matter to him i gotta you say
[1:25:30] well brother tim it got him
[1:25:32] thrown in the lion's den
[1:25:35] but look at the difference
[1:25:39] the king felt sorry for daniel
[1:25:43] until after pacing the floor all
[1:25:46] night long worrying about him
[1:25:50] he gets up the next morning goes down
[1:25:52] there and here's
[1:25:53] o king live forever
[1:25:57] you know what that king was thinking i
[1:25:59] wish
[1:26:00] i had a god like yes
[1:26:07] the message i was going to preach
[1:26:08] tonight was
[1:26:11] a casual christian a costume
[1:26:15] christian or a
[1:26:18] contagious christian
[1:26:21] which one are you
[1:26:24] daniel was a contagious christian
[1:26:28] they passed laws against him
[1:26:32] but when they were done the king said
[1:26:35] everybody's got to serve their god
[1:26:40] he had a he amen he had an experience
[1:26:43] that was contagious and then they were
[1:26:46] infecting
[1:26:47] an entire kingdom with their faith
[1:26:51] because they were standing on their
[1:26:53] christian principles
[1:26:54] they were standing on their convictions
[1:26:57] and god was coming on the scene
[1:26:59] to confirm it amen
[1:27:02] i'm glad we got some men like this in
[1:27:04] our family tree
[1:27:07] we've got a man like joseph that when
[1:27:09] potiphar's wife
[1:27:10] tried to trap him he didn't negotiate
[1:27:14] the situation
[1:27:16] he didn't try to figure out what is the
[1:27:18] most politically correct way
[1:27:20] for me to remove myself from here
[1:27:23] and not also offend her no he just took
[1:27:27] off running
[1:27:28] lickety-split amen he said leave my coat
[1:27:31] whatever i'm out of here
[1:27:33] he got he separated himself
[1:27:36] from the situation he separated himself
[1:27:40] from the temptation why that's what the
[1:27:43] sons of god do
[1:27:45] that's a family heritage amen you don't
[1:27:48] have to sit there and try to figure out
[1:27:50] oh how can i negotiate this
[1:27:51] just get out of there get away from the
[1:27:54] situation
[1:27:55] amen shine the appearance of evil the
[1:27:57] bible says
[1:27:59] amen we got a man like elijah
[1:28:03] who withstood ahab and jezebel i'm
[1:28:06] thankful for a man with faith like that
[1:28:08] with boldness like that the hebrew
[1:28:10] children who refuse to bow
[1:28:13] shamgar who refused to let the
[1:28:14] philistines rob his stored up harvest
[1:28:18] and all the martyrs who gave their lives
[1:28:20] for christ
[1:28:21] you know there's a great move in our
[1:28:23] nation today
[1:28:24] to tear down the memorials of those who
[1:28:27] fought for our freedoms but if we
[1:28:30] let their memorials and their memories
[1:28:33] be forgotten
[1:28:35] we will lose our appreciation for the
[1:28:38] value of the
[1:28:40] freedoms that they fought and bled
[1:28:43] and died to preserve
[1:28:46] so remember the agenda of the adversary
[1:28:50] is not just to defame the men
[1:28:54] it's to strip away your liberties
[1:28:58] their objective is has nothing to do
[1:29:00] with the men of history
[1:29:01] it has everything to do with where you
[1:29:04] stand today
[1:29:05] as a citizen because if they can make
[1:29:08] you
[1:29:08] lose your appreciation for the ones who
[1:29:10] fought to bring this to you
[1:29:13] then they can move you away from those
[1:29:15] liberties and those freedoms
[1:29:17] and the same thing is happening within
[1:29:18] the message
[1:29:20] it's not so much about tearing brother
[1:29:22] branham down
[1:29:24] as it is is hindering your faith
[1:29:28] brother branham has lived his life has
[1:29:31] gone to his reward
[1:29:33] amen and stands there beyond the curtain
[1:29:35] of time
[1:29:36] amen waiting for you and i so the
[1:29:38] objective is not so much to defame him
[1:29:41] but it's to make you lose your
[1:29:42] confidence
[1:29:44] it's to move you away amen from your
[1:29:47] destination
[1:29:48] and your inheritance but if you can
[1:29:51] recognize
[1:29:52] tonight that's my inheritance that's my
[1:29:54] heritage
[1:29:55] and i'm not forfeiting it i'm not giving
[1:29:58] it away
[1:29:58] and i appreciate what god has done amen
[1:30:04] amen
[1:30:06] don't let satan tear down the memorials
[1:30:09] if you let satan tear down the memorials
[1:30:12] you will soon become his prisoners
[1:30:15] that's the truth let me uh read a few
[1:30:18] statements here tonight from the message
[1:30:21] uh
[1:30:22] i believe it's spiritual amnesia i
[1:30:24] believe is where this was taken out of
[1:30:26] brother venom says yes if i want to
[1:30:28] remain
[1:30:29] a true american citizen now i'll tell
[1:30:32] you that i am an american
[1:30:34] i'm an american citizen i i think i'm as
[1:30:36] patriotic as anybody
[1:30:37] but i've never been more ashamed
[1:30:40] now of our nation and the things it
[1:30:44] no longer stands for and the way it's
[1:30:47] moved from its
[1:30:48] christian foundation it's a shame but if
[1:30:50] you look how the natural here that
[1:30:52] the prophet god is using types to the
[1:30:54] spiritual
[1:30:56] if i want to remain a true american
[1:30:58] citizen i must remember
[1:31:01] that i am what my nation is
[1:31:04] for i'm identified with my nation to
[1:31:07] forget her
[1:31:08] uh to fight for her or to die for her
[1:31:11] or to stand for all she stands for i
[1:31:13] must
[1:31:14] stand for it what my nation is
[1:31:18] i am and he goes and i'm going to skip a
[1:31:21] lot of this but he says don't you never
[1:31:23] forget it
[1:31:24] when you do you've got amnesia sure
[1:31:27] enough
[1:31:29] and remember you're no more american
[1:31:31] citizen
[1:31:32] when you can't become a part of it
[1:31:37] you know i'm going to break away from
[1:31:39] this just for a moment
[1:31:41] uh recently within the last five years
[1:31:43] or so
[1:31:45] russia went down to ukraine
[1:31:48] and they annexed a part of ukraine
[1:31:51] back to russia i believe they called it
[1:31:53] crimea
[1:31:55] well you know how russia did that they
[1:31:58] employed soldiers who went into that
[1:32:02] area
[1:32:03] and they were greedy they weren't
[1:32:06] russian
[1:32:07] and they weren't ukrainian so they were
[1:32:10] neutral
[1:32:12] or they appeared to be neutral
[1:32:17] they removed their identification
[1:32:21] to give the appearance that they
[1:32:24] were neutral but now
[1:32:27] years later after all of this has come
[1:32:30] to the surface it is learned
[1:32:31] they were not neutral
[1:32:35] they were paid russian operatives
[1:32:39] that were there to blend in among the
[1:32:42] ukrainians
[1:32:44] and make them comfortable with a foreign
[1:32:47] presence
[1:32:50] and make them feel like they might be
[1:32:52] okay
[1:32:54] in back again in a russian
[1:32:57] sovereign nation and i thought
[1:33:00] i wonder if the devil isn't doing the
[1:33:04] same thing now
[1:33:06] he's got some operatives and they want
[1:33:09] to take off
[1:33:10] the brand
[1:33:13] and they want to blend in and they want
[1:33:16] to make us comfortable
[1:33:18] with having them in our midst but they
[1:33:20] want to be careful how they're
[1:33:22] identified
[1:33:23] i want to tell you something as a
[1:33:25] christian you don't have to be ashamed
[1:33:27] that you're a christian as a believer of
[1:33:30] the message
[1:33:31] you don't have to be ashamed that you're
[1:33:33] a believer of the message
[1:33:35] if the enemy can convince you to remove
[1:33:38] your identification
[1:33:39] he can compromise you and soon you'll be
[1:33:42] paying taxes
[1:33:44] you'll be paying tribute you'll become a
[1:33:47] citizen
[1:33:48] of an enemy land isn't that the truth
[1:33:52] satan is very very shrewd but god is
[1:33:56] more powerful
[1:33:57] amen but he says you're no more american
[1:34:00] citizen when you can't become a part of
[1:34:02] it
[1:34:02] you must be what america is you must be
[1:34:05] also
[1:34:07] i must be partakers of her this is my
[1:34:10] nation i must be partakes
[1:34:12] of her what she is i am
[1:34:15] what she was i am no matter what she was
[1:34:18] i still am what she is and he goes on
[1:34:21] and he says
[1:34:22] i if i'm a real american citizen
[1:34:25] he said i landed on plymouth plymouth
[1:34:27] rock
[1:34:28] i rode with paul revere he said i
[1:34:31] crossed the delaware
[1:34:32] in other words all of the past
[1:34:36] historical events and characters
[1:34:39] i identify with them
[1:34:42] and their experiences so if that is true
[1:34:46] in the natural
[1:34:47] that is so much more true in the
[1:34:50] spiritual amen
[1:34:51] oh my i was there i was in him
[1:34:55] when he hung on calvary when my sins
[1:34:58] were
[1:34:58] judged even in my atonement i raised
[1:35:01] with him
[1:35:02] on that third and glorious morning when
[1:35:04] he says i am alive and i have the power
[1:35:07] over death and hell amen
[1:35:09] praise the lord i was with stone
[1:35:12] stonewall jackson he said i'm identified
[1:35:15] he said i
[1:35:16] i hoisted the flag on guam
[1:35:19] he said when i heard that they had put
[1:35:20] the flag up their tears run down my
[1:35:22] cheeks
[1:35:23] that was me that was you you say oh
[1:35:26] brother tim
[1:35:27] that happened on foreign soil that
[1:35:30] happened on
[1:35:30] uh 12 hours away that happened on the
[1:35:33] other side of the world
[1:35:34] but i'm tied to it because it preserved
[1:35:38] my freedom
[1:35:39] it preserved my liberty i'm connected to
[1:35:41] that amen
[1:35:43] all she is i am all her glory is my
[1:35:46] glory
[1:35:46] all her shame is my shape now to be a
[1:35:50] true christian
[1:35:51] you have to be the same we don't want to
[1:35:54] forget that
[1:35:55] all that he was i'm identified
[1:35:58] with him i'm identified with him notice
[1:36:02] he is in me and i in him now then
[1:36:05] every christian that's a real genuine
[1:36:08] christian
[1:36:08] was with him when the morning stars sang
[1:36:11] together
[1:36:12] and the sons of god shouted for joy
[1:36:14] before
[1:36:15] there was a foundation of the world
[1:36:19] we were identified in the immortal rims
[1:36:21] with god
[1:36:22] 10 million years before the world was
[1:36:25] ever formed
[1:36:27] i was there i was identified with him
[1:36:30] oh my we have a god-given heritage
[1:36:32] tonight
[1:36:34] don't let it slip away don't
[1:36:37] forget your piles of rocks don't forget
[1:36:40] your testimony
[1:36:42] go back and revisit it take someone with
[1:36:45] you
[1:36:46] show someone else amen what god has done
[1:36:49] in your life
[1:36:50] amen the new birth comes to give you a
[1:36:52] true heritage
[1:36:54] you may say brother tim i have nothing
[1:36:56] tonight as a mortal i have
[1:36:57] nothing as a natural man or woman you've
[1:37:00] got more than you could even begin to
[1:37:02] comprehend
[1:37:03] as a son or daughter of god amen brother
[1:37:06] branham
[1:37:07] came from a heritage of of liquor
[1:37:11] moonshine smoking
[1:37:14] drinking running from the law that was
[1:37:17] the
[1:37:17] that was the heritage of our prophet
[1:37:21] naturally speaking but there was another
[1:37:24] heritage
[1:37:26] that was there to prevail and
[1:37:29] when he was about to take the drink a
[1:37:31] voice spoke
[1:37:34] don't ever drink don't smoke don't
[1:37:36] defile your body
[1:37:38] because i've got a work for you to do
[1:37:41] when you grow older he went to smoke
[1:37:43] that cigarette
[1:37:44] don't another heritage amen what's
[1:37:48] coming there amen to protect him
[1:37:51] to bring him into that higher heritage
[1:37:54] amen
[1:37:56] i'm just i'm going to close with this
[1:37:58] thought tonight in genesis
[1:38:00] the bible talks about how when god
[1:38:02] formed adam
[1:38:04] into a body of flesh he was the only
[1:38:07] creature
[1:38:08] walking on the earth that did not have a
[1:38:11] companion
[1:38:13] of like specie now adam could
[1:38:16] watch all of the other animals and the
[1:38:18] birds and all of the creatures and enjoy
[1:38:21] all the scenery
[1:38:22] but he could not enjoy fellowship with
[1:38:25] an equal
[1:38:26] who could understand him until
[1:38:30] the bible says god laid adam in a deep
[1:38:33] sleep
[1:38:34] and he took from him a rib and the bible
[1:38:37] says the rib which the lord god had
[1:38:39] taken from man
[1:38:40] made he a woman brought
[1:38:44] her unto the man
[1:38:49] and i thought about that brought her
[1:38:52] unto the man and that just began to
[1:38:57] just go over and over my mind i thought
[1:38:59] you know i wonder if god didn't take
[1:39:02] that
[1:39:02] portion from adam's side and just go
[1:39:06] over to another area of the garden
[1:39:11] and form that into a a body
[1:39:14] the body of mrs adam we always want to
[1:39:17] call her eve but she didn't gain another
[1:39:19] identity
[1:39:20] until she transgressed so she was just
[1:39:24] mrs adam
[1:39:26] but then he he had to to wake her
[1:39:30] from her deep sleep and perhaps
[1:39:34] just in a way of dramatizing it he had
[1:39:36] to lead her
[1:39:38] through that garden past all of these
[1:39:41] other wonderful scenes
[1:39:44] a wondrous beauty all of that perfection
[1:39:47] and all of these other creatures
[1:39:51] until he could bring her back to the
[1:39:54] place
[1:39:55] where she began
[1:39:58] and say this is your purpose
[1:40:02] this is where you began you complete him
[1:40:07] and he completes you and now you can
[1:40:10] have fellowship
[1:40:12] now you can gain an identity
[1:40:16] now you can understand your heritage
[1:40:20] since you've been restored back to the
[1:40:23] side
[1:40:24] and i thought about that in the
[1:40:26] spiritual sense how a bride was
[1:40:28] separated from christ
[1:40:30] at calvary and just a couple years later
[1:40:33] she comes up to nicea rome and the world
[1:40:36] is trying to give the church an identity
[1:40:40] and all through seven church ages
[1:40:43] someone
[1:40:44] or something or some religious system or
[1:40:46] some
[1:40:47] world governments are trying to give his
[1:40:50] church
[1:40:51] an identity but all the time he's
[1:40:54] leading her
[1:40:56] through those ages and through those
[1:40:58] messengers
[1:40:59] he's leading her to a revelation of
[1:41:02] himself
[1:41:04] and the revelation of who he is enables
[1:41:08] you to then realize who you are
[1:41:12] as sons and daughters of god so in this
[1:41:15] hour he comes in the fullness of the
[1:41:18] revelation
[1:41:19] and the seals are open and the son of
[1:41:22] man is revealed and
[1:41:23] there's a manifestation on the earth
[1:41:26] and mrs jesus christ is
[1:41:30] joined in an invisible union
[1:41:33] to jesus christ the revealed word of the
[1:41:36] hour
[1:41:40] and then another creature comes along
[1:41:45] yay hath the lord god said
[1:41:51] he wants to devalue what is a proven
[1:41:55] and vindicated word
[1:41:58] to reduce her back to
[1:42:02] something less
[1:42:05] than what he has already declared her to
[1:42:07] be
[1:42:08] as the bride of jesus christ but i tell
[1:42:11] you what
[1:42:12] that ever six thousand years ago
[1:42:16] she listened but this one
[1:42:21] does not have the time she's not
[1:42:23] listening
[1:42:25] she's already received her heritage amen
[1:42:28] she's already been sealed
[1:42:30] into jesus christ she's accepted it
[1:42:33] she's been joined and nothing nothing
[1:42:37] nothing can separate her amen what can
[1:42:40] separate us from the love of god which
[1:42:43] is in christ jesus our lord
[1:42:45] shall distress or famine or nakedness or
[1:42:48] peril
[1:42:48] or sword no in all of these things

[1:47:13] that's the sermon coming up
[1:47:16] john chapter 13 verse
[1:47:20] 3. if you dare you can say amen

[1:48:12] you there this is the holy
[1:48:16] spirit working in the body
[1:48:20] that's a masterpiece amen

[1:48:59] rejoicing as poor
[1:49:04] like he mentioned that the cross we
[1:49:06] didn't own much
[1:49:08] we can't brag off too much as poor
[1:49:12] yet making many rich
[1:49:15] as having nothing naturally as a cross
[1:49:19] but spiritually as a child of god and
[1:49:22] yet
[1:49:24] possessing
[1:49:27] i thought jesus was the one that
[1:49:29] delivered all things
[1:49:31] now paul is saying we possess all
[1:49:34] things all that was in god was poor into
[1:49:39] christ or what all that was in christ
[1:49:41] was pouring to the
