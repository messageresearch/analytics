[21:44] you
[22:21] this reading and thank you sister and
[22:25] the Lord just seem to put a little
[22:27] something on my heart to bring to the
[22:29] church and I thought it's time to do it
[22:31] and now
[22:34] this when I arrived and then not knowing
[22:39] we'd be here this Sunday I've announced
[22:41] that I have a message for the church and
[22:47] I won't - if God willing bring this
[22:51] message next Sunday and there will be a
[22:54] quite a lengthy time so it probably will
[22:59] not get out before 12:30 1:00 o'clock
[23:02] maybe if at that time it's been on my
[23:06] heart for a long time and I think I owe
[23:10] the public an answer why that I haven't
[23:15] been active out in the field and I've
[23:18] preached all around it but I'm sure it
[23:20] hasn't ever just come right out to where
[23:23] it should be so I think the Lord willing
[23:26] next Sunday I just want to take my time
[23:29] and just lay out a reason and why and
[23:33] let you know scripturally what's going
[23:36] on and just why it's all about because
[23:39] I'll probably be going overseas or
[23:41] somewhere right away I'm waiting now to
[23:43] see which way he will call me to go
[23:47] last
[23:49] about three nights ago or two nights I
[23:52] had a phone call near midnight and
[23:55] it was to pray for some woman that was
[23:59] in the hospital and they call me and
[24:03] said pray and I forget the name that
[24:06] they gave me that said it was a friend
[24:09] to mrs. James Bell our sister here at
[24:13] the church a colored sister a very loyal
[24:15] fine woman Hobley the name a shepherd
[24:18] was giving so I got out of the bed and
[24:22] knelt down and and told my wife for the
[24:25] phone ringing woke her up and I said we
[24:28] must pray for mrs. Shepherd a sister
[24:32] that's called it's a friend to mrs. Jane
[24:35] Bell so we prayed for her got back in
[24:39] the bed and then long about 10 or 11
[24:42] o'clock the next day I got a call again
[24:46] his Billy and he said it wasn't miss
[24:49] Shepard so it was Miss Bell herself not
[24:52] miss bells friend it was mrs. Bell and
[24:55] she's in the hospital very seriously and
[25:01] rushing at the hospital but she was gone
[25:05] the Lord had called mrs. Bell home
[25:09] mrs. Bell has been a faithful
[25:13] gather with us here at the church for
[25:15] years her husband James and I worked
[25:20] together with my father many years ago
[25:23] out running we run these Spurs in from
[25:26] the Pennsylvania into the Colgate sir
[25:29] many years ago I guess 30 years ago or
[25:32] more and
[25:34] we love sister Bell
[25:37] she was a grand person and I understand
[25:42] she had a cute attacked of gallbladder
[25:45] condition and
[25:47] they her physician that knew the case
[25:53] real well was out of town at the time
[25:56] and a new physician came to look at her
[25:59] and it advised emergency operation and
[26:02] she never survived and and she was I
[26:07] think her way I understand it that her
[26:09] regular physician wouldn't have
[26:11] prescribed the operation because she was
[26:15] heavyset and her gall bladder was bad
[26:18] and she'd have stones I think or
[26:21] something in it and and the Lord had
[26:23] been merciful she'd had those attacks
[26:25] before and the Lord and taking care of
[26:27] those many times but just happened to be
[26:29] that well if we bring it to a full
[26:34] measure we'd say this God had called her
[26:37] sister Vail and that's what it had to be
[26:39] taken he's yeah and how that he Miss
[26:43] Brown around to me that I thought it was
[26:45] mrs. a miss Shepherd I don't know miss
[26:47] Shepherd the lady maybe you're the
[26:49] morning and I'm a nor for look at her
[26:50] face but it was said it was a Mrs
[26:53] Shepard and whether it's all done like
[26:54] that so that fitted by Noah been mrs.
[26:59] Bell have been in that shape I'd
[27:00] probably went out there and been
[27:01] interceding far right away and then see
[27:04] that God didn't want us to do that
[27:05] perhaps so we know that all these things
[27:07] work together for good to them that love
[27:10] God and I'm sure that sister Bell loved
[27:13] our Lord and she was a good woman now
[27:17] she's one of us
[27:19] in here we don't have any lines of color
[27:24] the family of God doesn't draw lines of
[27:27] color whether we're red brown black or
[27:30] yellow it doesn't matter white whatever
[27:32] it is we are brothers and sisters in
[27:35] Christ and so we we love her and we'll
[27:39] miss her the tabernacle how will I miss
[27:42] sister bells I'm great big course a man
[27:45] back there in a corner and take her up
[27:49] home should talk about the Lord Jesus
[27:51] and if I understand it right never knew
[27:54] it you'll just a few moments ago but I
[27:55] think her funeral is being held right
[27:57] here in the church this coming Tuesday
[27:59] after one o'clock and I think you and I
[28:02] are two fish ate in this funeral service
[28:04] but just in a congregation that were one
[28:07] weaker this morning in a respect of our
[28:10] sister Bell that sustained to her feet
[28:12] testimony

[55:28] twins and they have given their heart to
[55:31] the Lord and by the grace of God I spoke
[55:33] to brother Mutombo and he has a pool
[55:35] back there and he filled the pool with
[55:37] water so at the end of the service when
[55:40] with probably you Dada on the online you
[55:44] might probably not have that opportunity
[55:46] but the folks that I hear will go back
[55:48] there and baptize those two sister one
[55:51] soul worth a thousand word two souls 20
[55:57] if it's ten thousand word it's twenty if
[56:01] it's a thousand it's two thousand so you
[56:04] make the Martha or you do the math if
[56:08] you would let's go straight to the word
[56:10] I was doing those drawing yesterday
[56:14] brother David was a witness it doesn't
[56:18] look pretty but this is pretty loaded so
[56:22] by God's grace I will really encourage
[56:26] you to stay put so pay attention
[56:30] do not move if you need your water or
[56:33] coffee get it at home close to you
[56:36] because we don't want to leave anybody
[56:38] behind
[56:40] Genesis chapter 15
[56:44] beginning by verse 3 I'm gonna read one
[56:48] or three words and you might be seated
[56:50] because I need to build from there I
[56:52] don't want you to be standing at home or
[56:54] wherever you are
[56:56] Genesis 15 verse 3 if you dare you can
[57:01] say Amen and
[57:04] Abram say behold
[57:07] to me you have given no seed you might
[57:10] be seated for
[57:12] his God and
[57:14] lo one born in my house is my hair
[57:18] talking about Eliezer of Damascus and
[57:22] behold the word of the Lord came to him
[57:24] saying this shall not be your heir in
[57:28] other word it's not the one you thinking
[57:31] that's going to take your place but he
[57:34] does shall come forth out of your own
[57:37] bowels shall be your hair now what is
[57:41] important is verse five now and he
[57:44] brought him forth abroad al-saad and say
[57:48] look now toward her so
[58:17] [Music]
[58:57] because we prove to you that the solar
[59:00] system brother branham call it disorient
[59:04] you to the heaven they have an Abraham
[59:08] whose lieutenant is what we refer as a
[59:11] sky or the firmament or the heaven so
[59:16] Abraham was looking right here
[59:18] everybody here okay praise God we put my
[59:23] Bible here he said look toward heaven
[59:25] and tell the Stars now if you take an
[59:30] airplane like we spoke before and you
[59:32] went into the cloud here you not gonna
[59:35] see any stars they star are outside the
[59:39] earth your son is not who I hear your
[59:43] son is outside the earth the planets are
[59:47] not within the earth salut the planet
[59:49] are outside the earth so God spoke to
[59:53] Abraham he said look through the
[59:56] firmament and we know that the firmament
[59:58] is like a glass it's like a mirror it's
[1:00:02] like a stream and God said look the
[1:00:05] stream but what I want you to pay
[1:00:08] attention to is not the cloud I want you
[1:00:11] to pay attention to the star in other
[1:00:14] words the screen right here or the sky
[1:00:17] or the firmament reflect the zodiac
[1:00:21] everybody praise God I know you're
[1:00:24] saying Amen online
[1:00:26] so tell the star if you be able to
[1:00:30] number them and he said to him so shall
[1:00:33] be your seed singular not plural your
[1:00:39] seed B and we know when we spoke about
[1:00:42] the seed of Abraham we used to take that
[1:00:45] seed as a natural seed then in the book
[1:00:48] in the New Testament when Paul came out
[1:00:50] Paul say ah if you notice when God was
[1:00:55] speaking to Abraham when God say your
[1:00:58] seed God spoke about that seed not
[1:01:01] plural it's in the book of Galatians he
[1:01:05] said not plural but singular which was
[1:01:08] speaking about Christ are you there so
[1:01:12] God is telling Abraham look true because
[1:01:16] and whatever you see there
[1:01:19] is trust
[1:01:22] so the zodiac reflect Christ oh my god I
[1:01:30] don't want you to say brother Steve
[1:01:32] insane
[1:01:34] the third one Abraham covenant the third
[1:01:39] one wrote on paper because this is the
[1:01:41] great educational age that we are living
[1:01:44] in and neither will none of them
[1:01:47] contradict one another we spoke about
[1:01:50] the first bubble be the zodiac the
[1:01:53] second bubble in the pyramid and the
[1:01:54] third bubble is the written word brother
[1:01:57] branham is saying none of those bubble
[1:01:59] contradicts one another in other word
[1:02:01] whatever is in it you can follow through
[1:02:04] the lineup together and brother Branham
[1:02:06] continued he say you see the great solar
[1:02:09] system speak of Christ
[1:02:13] everything that you see
[1:02:16] of crust if you just look at it look at
[1:02:21] the church today in its condition weak
[1:02:24] bucks leading gone back into the world
[1:02:27] that speak of Christ exactly what he's
[1:02:30] so the plan I'm pulling right here is
[1:02:33] whatever God told Abraham to look at was
[1:02:37] the solar system but that solar system
[1:02:40] spoke about Christ
[1:02:43] brother branham spoke if you recall when
[1:02:46] we went through the mystery of the three
[1:02:48] heaven brother Branham said the solar
[1:02:50] system is the clan of Jesus Christ and
[1:02:53] run run on explains that the clan is a
[1:02:56] kingdom so this solar system reflect
[1:03:00] cross it is Christ's Kingdom
[1:03:03] everybody there now let's go to the
[1:03:06] second scripture
[1:03:08] still in the book of Genesis Genesis
[1:03:12] chapter 37 if you dare you can say Amen
[1:03:17] you now going nowhere so give me time
[1:03:20] and let me unload myself so don't put me
[1:03:24] under pressure brother Robert should be
[1:03:27] smiling somewhere where he is it
[1:03:30] Genesis chapter 37 verse
[1:03:33] 9 if you dare you can say Amen and
[1:03:37] he dreamed talking about Joseph they
[1:03:40] dream of Joseph and he dreamed yet
[1:03:43] another dream are you there if you dare
[1:03:48] you can still you can begin to see
[1:03:50] something riding ok praise God and told
[1:03:55] it to his brethren and say behold I have
[1:03:58] dreamed a dream more I have dreamed a
[1:04:02] dream more and behold the Sun and we
[1:04:06] call again the Sun is not here the Sun
[1:04:10] is in the zodiac so Joseph is drawing
[1:04:13] our attention to the first bubble God
[1:04:17] drew Abraham attention to the first
[1:04:21] bubble are you there praise God
[1:04:24] he said look behold the Sun and the moon
[1:04:29] your moon is not in the firmament here
[1:04:31] your moon is outside the earth and the
[1:04:35] moon and the Eleven stars
[1:04:39] right the star of sad world zodiac the
[1:04:46] Sun zodiac the moon zodiac but now he's
[1:04:52] not like Abraham with Abraham he said
[1:04:54] look at them all that is Christ but with
[1:04:58] Joseph he turn around he said
[1:05:01] look there is only 11 star so we got
[1:05:06] right here
[1:05:07] 11 stars right there
[1:05:10] the Sun the Moon and Eleven stars if you
[1:05:15] notice at this stage of Joseph's life
[1:05:21] Benjamin was not born
[1:05:23] search your scripture if you have any
[1:05:26] question after church give me a call are
[1:05:29] you there so in this stage of life
[1:05:32] Benjamin was not born and Joseph is
[1:05:35] saying I saw the Sun a solar moon I saw
[1:05:40] 11 star they were are bowing to me so we
[1:05:45] have Sun Moon 11 star plus Joseph 12 but
[1:05:52] even though it's 12
[1:05:54] Benjamin is not born
[1:05:57] in other word Benjamin already existed
[1:06:01] in the zodiac
[1:06:03] before he was even born into the earth
[1:06:06] if you give me time I'm going to show
[1:06:09] you yourself in the zodiac are you there
[1:06:13] Joseph was already speaking about
[1:06:15] Benjamin before even Benjamin was born
[1:06:22] praise God and the Eleven stars
[1:06:26] made obedience to me and he told it to
[1:06:31] his father and to his Brennan and his
[1:06:34] father rebuked him and say to him what
[1:06:37] is this dream that you have dreamed
[1:06:41] now Jacob as a prophet is going to give
[1:06:44] the interpretation but he's going to
[1:06:46] miss Benjamin
[1:06:49] Joseph came and I was telling to him
[1:06:51] like daddy you still have a boy that is
[1:06:55] going to be born in the future but daddy
[1:06:57] got angry interpret only the superficial
[1:07:01] part of the vision and left the other
[1:07:04] one
[1:07:05] are you there because when Benjamin was
[1:07:09] born Joseph was in Egypt
[1:07:11] let's see the interpretation
[1:07:15] praise God shall I Oh
[1:07:19] so Jacob is putting himself in the
[1:07:22] vision so Jacob is saying that the son
[1:07:26] that you sold is me are we clear so
[1:07:30] Jacob call himself a son praise God and
[1:07:38] your mother Oh
[1:07:40] so Joseph is saying Jacob is saying that
[1:07:44] the moon
[1:07:46] represented your mother but we know that
[1:07:49] Jacob had four women
[1:07:53] are you there the first one was Leah
[1:07:58] Leah gave him six son and she had two
[1:08:02] daughters if you have a question with
[1:08:05] two daughters see me after church I will
[1:08:08] show it to you I know your bind he's
[1:08:10] saying Dinah one one one there is two
[1:08:13] okay you have any questions see me I'll
[1:08:16] show you that in a bubble and then the
[1:08:18] second woman will see oppa
[1:08:20] which was a concubine
[1:08:24] to sons then the third one was Billa a
[1:08:28] concubine to sons then the last one was
[1:08:33] Rachel and from Rachel first came Joseph
[1:08:37] one then later on Benjamin came - if you
[1:08:42] take 6 plus 2 8 plus 2 10 plus 1 xi plus
[1:08:49] Joseph they are bowing so Benjamin was
[1:08:53] already here by he was not even born yet
[1:08:55] either but
[1:08:58] when Jacob is referring the moon
[1:09:02] he picked Rachel
[1:09:07] he didn't quit Leah he didn't pick Zappa
[1:09:11] he didn't pick Bella he picked Fletcher
[1:09:15] so natura here
[1:09:20] is represented as the mother of the 12
[1:09:24] tribes
[1:09:26] as the mother of Israel
[1:09:32] let me help you up before we get there
[1:09:35] if you recall when Jeremiah was
[1:09:38] prophesying about the death of children
[1:09:42] at the coming of Jesus Christ he said
[1:09:46] that there is lamentation in Ramah who
[1:09:50] was crying brother Robert where you are
[1:09:53] it is Rachel that was crying for his
[1:09:57] children he was not Leah he was not
[1:10:00] Shilpa because the zodiac recognized
[1:10:03] Rachel so when those prophets are lining
[1:10:06] up they are lining up with Livadia
[1:10:08] because whatever information is in the
[1:10:11] zodiac he must be reflected all the way
[1:10:14] down to the written word
[1:10:16] everybody there oh my God where am I so
[1:10:21] I am your mother and your brethren
[1:10:23] indeed come to bow down ourselves to you
[1:10:26] to the earth last Scripture let's go to
[1:10:30] the book of Revelation so just by the
[1:10:34] reading of the scripture you've already
[1:10:35] got a message
[1:10:39] if you dare you can say Amen
[1:10:43] revelation 12
[1:10:46] beginning by verse 1
[1:10:51] okay all right and
[1:10:54] they appear a great wonder in what
[1:10:58] another heaven that's why we have to
[1:11:01] teach the mystery of the three heaven
[1:11:04] and that heaven again we see whether
[1:11:08] it's right here or over there Abraham
[1:11:11] here Joseph here what about this one
[1:11:15] praise God and
[1:11:17] they appeared a great wonder in heaven a
[1:11:21] woman
[1:11:22] clothed with the Sun so it is not this
[1:11:28] heaven ah here we back again in the
[1:11:31] zodiac
[1:11:33] who is the son
[1:11:35] is it Jacob again at the opening of the
[1:11:42] 17th all the mysteries of God must be
[1:11:46] revealed with God a
[1:11:49] woman clothed with the Sun and the moon
[1:11:53] under his feet we found out that there
[1:11:56] is another Sunday and there is another
[1:11:59] moon there who is that moon I'm not
[1:12:02] going to tell you brother Branham you
[1:12:03] tell us you need a prophet and the moon
[1:12:08] under her feet and upon her head a crown
[1:12:11] of water
[1:12:15] Joseph's vision Sun Moon eleven star
[1:12:20] plus him twelve and this book of
[1:12:23] Revelation we see another Sun Moon with
[1:12:28] a woman and then twelve stars who are
[1:12:31] those twelve star in Joseph's vision we
[1:12:34] know it's the twelve patriarch
[1:12:38] clear what about in Revelation we're
[1:12:42] going to ask Malik - are we the
[1:12:46] twelve star and she being with a child
[1:12:49] with child cried travailing birth and
[1:12:52] pained to be delivered and they appear
[1:12:56] another wonder in heaven and
[1:12:59] behold a great red
[1:13:02] so in this area here a dragon appeared I
[1:13:08] didn't want to get into it but there is
[1:13:11] a constellation that is called Draco
[1:13:14] it's the constellation of a dragon if
[1:13:18] you check whatever you want to check you
[1:13:21] and that there is a zodiac sign called
[1:13:24] the dragon and the revelation the book
[1:13:27] of Revelation also spoke about the
[1:13:29] dragon in the heaven they are three
[1:13:32] lineup together are we there and they
[1:13:36] appear not a wonder in heaven and behold
[1:13:39] a great dragon having seven heads and
[1:13:42] ten horns and seven clan upon his head
[1:13:44] that's a message by itself and he still
[1:13:48] they tell
[1:13:51] Jude the third part of the stars of
[1:13:54] heaven
[1:13:56] stars of heaven who are those stars
[1:14:00] indeed cast them to the earth and the
[1:14:04] dragon stood before the woman which was
[1:14:06] ready to deliver for to devour her child
[1:14:09] as soon as he was born and she brought
[1:14:12] forth a man child who was to rule all
[1:14:15] nations with a rod of iron and her child
[1:14:18] was caught up clawed up it's the word
[1:14:22] for Russia
[1:14:23] caught up to God and to his throne if
[1:14:27] you notice the event happened in the
[1:14:31] zodiac but there was a rupture to God so
[1:14:37] God is in another dimension
[1:14:42] are we there so let's pray and we go
[1:14:46] Heavenly Father Lord we thank you for
[1:14:49] your grace your love your mercy and for
[1:14:51] everything you have done for us father
[1:14:54] we are committing this service unto the
[1:14:56] hand may you be the Alpha and the Omega
[1:14:59] of this service father may you move me
[1:15:02] completely away because I'm surrendering
[1:15:04] myself unto thee expressing in front of
[1:15:07] your children that I do not know
[1:15:09] anything Lord father made the holy
[1:15:12] spirit made the inside teacher may you
[1:15:15] come down and teach your word to your
[1:15:17] children Lord bless them Lord Father
[1:15:19] wherever they are Lord in the name of
[1:15:21] Jesus Christ amen
[1:15:23] all right now our subject is part 4 of
[1:15:29] the unchanging pattern of God
[1:15:32] we spoke that God does not changed and
[1:15:35] we also expressed that God has three
[1:15:38] bubble the first bubble was in the
[1:15:42] zodiac the second bubble was in the
[1:15:45] pyramid and the third bubble was also in
[1:15:50] the written word if you don't mind I can
[1:15:52] us distinguish ear but brother branham
[1:15:56] also mentioned about another bubble
[1:15:59] but I wanna say that when he was a
[1:16:03] sinner he says that nature was his
[1:16:08] bubble but brother branham told us that
[1:16:12] there is three bubble and what what I'm
[1:16:15] saying that God is perfected in three so
[1:16:19] if you add another bubble how are we
[1:16:22] going to put that together was brother
[1:16:25] Graham I'm making a mistake or what I
[1:16:28] told you whenever you hit the bone eat
[1:16:31] the flesh leave the bone alone
[1:16:34] because if you mess around with it you
[1:16:36] can either take your way of getting
[1:16:38] trouble so brother branham say that the
[1:16:42] zodiac itself was a bubble and when you
[1:16:46] look at the zodiac the earth as a planet
[1:16:49] is also part of the zodiac
[1:16:53] so when you are reading the zodiac a
[1:16:56] star is a scripture a
[1:17:00] planet is a book
[1:17:03] are you there are you there because it's
[1:17:07] God babu-brother God I'm saying when he
[1:17:09] was placing those
[1:17:11] sir when he was pressing those planet
[1:17:14] God was riding his bubble so when you're
[1:17:19] looking at the star you are looking at
[1:17:21] scriptures
[1:17:23] when you looking at the planet Pluto
[1:17:26] March Jupiter you are looking at books
[1:17:29] of the heavenly Babel are you there so
[1:17:34] if you look around the planet there is a
[1:17:37] planet called Earth and brother branham
[1:17:41] say within the planet Earth
[1:17:44] are you there there is a whole bubble
[1:17:48] that is written there
[1:17:51] so the earth bubble is a bubble with in
[1:17:56] a bubble I'm going slowly I don't know
[1:17:59] if I will finish this message are you
[1:18:01] there so when you look at Pluto it's
[1:18:05] written about something when you look at
[1:18:07] Jupiter it's talking about something
[1:18:10] when you look at large it's talking
[1:18:12] about something when you look at earth
[1:18:14] it's talking about something but when
[1:18:17] you enter earth there is also a bubble
[1:18:20] written in Earth
[1:18:23] so still three bubble but in one of the
[1:18:27] book
[1:18:28] of zodiac there is a whole bubble
[1:18:32] retaining that book on earth
[1:18:37] hallelujah
[1:18:40] brother branham say here in the message
[1:18:43] Lord show us the father and it sufficeth
[1:18:45] us did you ever notice my first Bible
[1:18:49] was
[1:18:50] nature if you here say man so they came
[1:18:55] here because if somebody don't see there
[1:18:57] I want them to see not brother Steven
[1:18:59] saying the Bible says brother branham
[1:19:02] say my first Bible was in nature and God
[1:19:06] does dwell in his universe
[1:19:11] are you there the solar system in his
[1:19:15] nature
[1:19:16] praise God
[1:19:18] let's go on again
[1:19:20] the choosing of the blood as we see that
[1:19:24] all of the natural things is the top of
[1:19:28] the spiritual things I believe I'd miss
[1:19:32] something okay that's a writing why some
[1:19:35] people can keep the victory in studying
[1:19:38] in study of nature as I have been
[1:19:41] preaching because he was my first Bible
[1:19:45] to lead me to classroom
[1:19:49] by the Brannen first father was nature
[1:19:53] this is even written in the book of
[1:19:56] Romans if
[1:19:57] you going Roman chapter 1 you will see
[1:20:00] the Bible say that God express himself
[1:20:02] through the visible things if you need a
[1:20:05] scripture see me I will send it to you
[1:20:08] we never had the Bible in our home and I
[1:20:13] was 20 years old we never seen a Bible
[1:20:17] as far as I know in a home so by the
[1:20:20] branham Baba was nature
[1:20:24] praise God now we can go to the choosing
[1:20:28] of the blood
[1:20:29] see that all of the natural things is
[1:20:32] the top of the spiritual things as we
[1:20:35] went through in our lesson this morning
[1:20:37] as the Sun and his nature
[1:20:41] that was my first Bible before I ever
[1:20:46] read the page in the Bible knew God
[1:20:50] because the Bible is written everywhere
[1:20:53] in nature
[1:20:55] that's brother Branham and it just
[1:20:59] correspond with the Word of God
[1:21:03] are you there so in the Soviet bubble
[1:21:07] there is Co the earth and in the book
[1:21:11] there is another bub and brother branham
[1:21:14] say when you look at the three Bible you
[1:21:17] learning up together they don't
[1:21:19] contradict one another when you go to
[1:21:22] the written word the Bible in the
[1:21:24] written word has 66 books are you there
[1:21:29] but there is a book in the Bible called
[1:21:32] the Book of Isaiah and
[1:21:35] the Book of Isaiah has 66 chapters
[1:21:39] it is a book within the Bible but this
[1:21:44] book wrote the whole battle
[1:21:47] where do you get this stuff
[1:21:55] I'm say Isaiah what Finke of crust if
[1:21:59] you don't see the co2 good you need it
[1:22:01] let me know as there was a major profit
[1:22:05] he wrote a barber in itself brother
[1:22:10] Branham was not contradicting himself
[1:22:13] either you leave it alone or you wait
[1:22:16] till the unknown income there is
[1:22:18] sixty-six books in Isaiah 66 chapter in
[1:22:24] Isaiah 66 books in the Bible right he
[1:22:30] start off with the question large
[1:22:32] Genesis right in the middle of the book
[1:22:36] where the New Testament came John the
[1:22:39] Baptist comes up and then in the end he
[1:22:42] ends it within the Millennium build
[1:22:44] houses inhabit them plant vineyard and
[1:22:47] eat thereof he wrote a whole
[1:22:50] Bible
[1:22:52] he was one of the prophet that God got
[1:22:56] by the top of the neck raised him up and
[1:22:59] let him see from end to beginning then
[1:23:04] they're beginning to the end back and
[1:23:06] forth and as they rotted so just like
[1:23:10] the zodiac a bubble but another bubble
[1:23:14] within the bubble the written word also
[1:23:17] have 66 book Leviticus Genesis our zaiah
[1:23:23] whatever you call it but within there
[1:23:26] there is another book that also have a
[1:23:29] Bible in itself are we clear so as we
[1:23:34] studying our subject now which is the
[1:23:36] unchanging part of God we were trying to
[1:23:40] put a basis a foundation to show that we
[1:23:43] are not following any cunningly devised
[1:23:46] message this message is not fabricated
[1:23:50] by men this message was confirmed in the
[1:23:54] zodiac the
[1:23:55] teaching of the message are in the
[1:23:58] zodiac the Ministry of brother Branham
[1:24:02] is in this order the birth of brother
[1:24:05] Branham who came from the zodiac and
[1:24:08] even brother branham himself
[1:24:12] either not only is his ministry is in
[1:24:17] the zodiac even in nature
[1:24:20] in the within the earth the name of
[1:24:25] brother Branham was written in nature
[1:24:29] swallow that pretty good but we're gonna
[1:24:31] get there are you there so this message
[1:24:34] is confirming the zodiac confirming the
[1:24:38] pyramid and confirm in the written word
[1:24:41] so last time we spoke about the message
[1:24:44] in the pyramid we showed you how we
[1:24:47] started by the virgin then you come up
[1:24:50] as a lion now we want to go back to the
[1:24:53] zodiac finish the zodiac today then we
[1:24:57] will drop down into the written world
[1:24:59] now there is 12 major son of the zodiac
[1:25:03] we spoke about it we want but by the
[1:25:07] grace of God today we're gonna go
[1:25:09] through one of them each one and clear
[1:25:11] the whole thing are you there now when
[1:25:14] we spoke in part 1 and part 2 just to
[1:25:18] catch whoever is left behind we spoke
[1:25:21] about areas which is one of the 12 sharp
[1:25:24] 12 sign we found out that areas spoke
[1:25:29] about how Jesus Christ will be born and
[1:25:32] aliens told us that Jesus will come as
[1:25:35] friend and brother branham say if you
[1:25:38] notice he was born in April when he was
[1:25:41] in Apple he said that's the mass where
[1:25:43] areas is covering and if you notice at
[1:25:48] the birth of Christ starts line up
[1:25:51] and Jesus was born and in this end time
[1:25:55] again three stars line up and brother
[1:25:59] Branham was born and he was born also in
[1:26:02] April so
[1:26:06] that areas not only spoke about crust he
[1:26:10] also spoke about this anthem messenger
[1:26:13] I'm going slowly are you there when we
[1:26:18] look at Taurus Taurus
[1:26:21] was the sacrifice of Jesus Christ we
[1:26:25] show you completely that cars have to be
[1:26:27] killed because in the Old Testament they
[1:26:30] pick up the blood take it to the mercy
[1:26:32] seat and sprinkled emergency seven times
[1:26:35] which was speaking about the seven
[1:26:37] churches then we showed you please which
[1:26:40] was speaking about seven dove
[1:26:44] seven stars and seven sisters which were
[1:26:48] the seven churches with the messenger
[1:26:51] and the seven spirits of seven
[1:26:54] manifestation of the Holy Spirit that
[1:26:57] were through the messenger that's why
[1:27:00] brother Branham was waiting on that
[1:27:02] seventh dove take the message in the
[1:27:05] seventh in the wings office not dog then
[1:27:08] we spoke about Orion which were speaking
[1:27:11] about Nimrod the spirit of Babylon then
[1:27:14] we touch up on the two bears which was
[1:27:17] the bigger bear and a little bit it's
[1:27:20] called in the United States then little
[1:27:23] deeper and a big deep deeper
[1:27:26] when you connect those stars all of them
[1:27:31] have seven stars when you connect them
[1:27:33] they appear like a deeper that's why the
[1:27:37] United States called them a bit deeper
[1:27:39] and a little deeper but when we look at
[1:27:42] those two we found out that in the
[1:27:45] deeper there were two stars we spoke
[1:27:48] about them when you trace a line and you
[1:27:50] line up those two stars
[1:27:53] automatically those star points you to
[1:27:55] the North Star and they were using these
[1:27:59] two star as
[1:28:00] navigational guidance if you miss the
[1:28:04] lobster and you cannot find enough star
[1:28:07] go ahead and sand those two star those
[1:28:11] two star will point you directly to the
[1:28:13] north star and we showed you that we
[1:28:16] have seven messenger but in between
[1:28:19] those messenger in between them when you
[1:28:22] start at the beginning with Paul at the
[1:28:24] end and they only truth our prophet and
[1:28:28] when Paul came Paul say follow me as a
[1:28:32] father
[1:28:34] random said they're not presented oh my
[1:28:37] god
[1:28:38] William Mariota Branham their solar
[1:28:42] system has not changed they thawed yuck
[1:28:45] the morning star rises on it poster duty
[1:28:49] every morning just exactly the way when
[1:28:52] the earth was created the evening star
[1:28:54] taking place every star deliver deeper
[1:28:58] because the Little Dipper is the only
[1:29:00] constellation that contained the lost
[1:29:03] art he had seven stars at one of those
[1:29:06] star is the lobster are you there and
[1:29:10] right at the time of season is just
[1:29:13] exactly where it's supposed to be the
[1:29:16] North Star stand steady and never moves
[1:29:21] hallelujah the whole thing the whole
[1:29:25] zodiac
[1:29:27] Northstar you got through March
[1:29:29] Northstar every star connected to the
[1:29:33] North Star the
[1:29:34] whole fish it is right in the center of
[1:29:38] the earth so
[1:29:40] if you wanna know your center of the
[1:29:43] earth you need to Center it with the
[1:29:46] lobster praise God that is Christ
[1:29:51] that's why brother Branham say if you
[1:29:55] look at the zodiac brother branham said
[1:29:58] the zodiac speaks of Christ and run run
[1:30:02] and say the center of the zodiac is the
[1:30:05] North Star which everything in the
[1:30:09] zodiac revolve around it so if you look
[1:30:13] in the zodiac and you don't see a
[1:30:16] connection with the North Star you have
[1:30:20] not read the zodiac pretty well
[1:30:22] because the zodiac because the knob
[1:30:25] starts one speaks about crust that's why
[1:30:28] I brought upon him saying if you read
[1:30:29] your Bible and you don't see Christ you
[1:30:33] ran around go back again and read
[1:30:36] because the entire Bible revolve around
[1:30:38] crashed
[1:30:41] Alleluia
[1:30:43] da he stand there command his army like
[1:30:47] a great captain let me know about the
[1:30:49] time buddy John for instance here is an
[1:30:53] old trick to a garden you know if you
[1:30:56] can see the Stars anyone can tell which
[1:30:59] way you are going if you shall watch the
[1:31:02] star and you always want to watch the
[1:31:06] one true star
[1:31:08] there is only one true star and that is
[1:31:12] the lobster
[1:31:15] see only one he stand in the same place
[1:31:19] that
[1:31:21] represent trust the same yesterday today
[1:31:25] and forever
[1:31:27] are you there so when we look on the
[1:31:31] Little Dipper we found out that crust is
[1:31:35] one of the seven angels
[1:31:37] everybody here and we found that this
[1:31:40] time the cloud came and when we look in
[1:31:45] the cloud brother branham said the
[1:31:48] coming of the cloud was the fulfillment
[1:31:50] of Revelation 10 and when when I'm
[1:31:53] saying in Revelation 10 the Lavi angel
[1:31:56] that came down was Christ and when
[1:31:59] brother Branham entered the
[1:32:01] constellation when we look around
[1:32:03] brother Branham saw that there was one
[1:32:06] angel which was different than all the
[1:32:09] six and one random said there was the
[1:32:13] seventh year and that was Christ so your
[1:32:16] zodiac spoke about the cloud before the
[1:32:21] cloud happened in Arizona so the cloud
[1:32:26] is not a mistake
[1:32:29] it's not a rocket it's not something
[1:32:34] that happened by any chance and matter
[1:32:37] of fact when they took the picture they
[1:32:40] turn it to the right he was the picture
[1:32:42] of who
[1:32:45] the picture of who crashed a
[1:32:50] thousand rocket and pull me the picture
[1:32:53] you are spoken in the zodiac
[1:32:57] before it happened because what a
[1:32:59] Branham said before God does anything on
[1:33:02] the earth
[1:33:03] put it out today he was already waiting
[1:33:06] in that bubble under the little
[1:33:09] different there was a constellation of
[1:33:11] seven stars one of them was Christ
[1:33:15] are you there so one evil came and enoch
[1:33:20] built the pyramid are you there let's
[1:33:24] see how he put up the pyramid
[1:33:28] praise God
[1:33:30] in the message paradise
[1:33:33] they had the secret they know how to do
[1:33:37] it they had a greater and greater
[1:33:39] instrument that pyramid said so
[1:33:43] perfectly in the center of the
[1:33:47] brother branham just told us that the
[1:33:50] center of the zodiac which is the Sultan
[1:33:55] so when we knock brother pyramid his
[1:33:59] eyes was well at least enough star as
[1:34:02] long as the pyramids lined up with the
[1:34:06] knob star no matter how the sun is
[1:34:10] shining around it no shadow
[1:34:14] are you there if you don't want a shadow
[1:34:18] in your life line up with Christ if you
[1:34:22] don't want any trouble in your life line
[1:34:24] up with Christ when you land up with
[1:34:28] Christ with all the shadow will run away
[1:34:31] from you because he's the father of
[1:34:33] light in him there is no turning nor
[1:34:36] shadow
[1:34:38] are you there
[1:34:43] praise God
[1:34:44] let's see them heal an up with the start
[1:34:47] why is this star important
[1:34:50] if you are a woman
[1:34:54] young sister wherever you are
[1:34:57] if you are a young woman
[1:35:01] dedicate your morals
[1:35:05] young sister take your passion take that
[1:35:10] first that you want a companion
[1:35:13] take your virtue or clearly of rigidity
[1:35:19] taking a body
[1:35:21] dedicate that to somebody who's that
[1:35:25] person
[1:35:26] crust let's keep reading you say he is
[1:35:30] talking to the sisters because we have a
[1:35:32] tendency to point hand or fingers to
[1:35:35] Sister Sister Sister Sister Sister what
[1:35:38] about brothers if it's like their
[1:35:40] brother has the right to go to the
[1:35:43] nightclub do all kind of stuff when they
[1:35:45] come back I want to get married to a
[1:35:47] virgin what about your stealth
[1:35:51] what about yourself I
[1:35:57] hope you want to love me
[1:36:00] if you are a young man
[1:36:02] dedicate your morals young woman you are
[1:36:06] a young man so not only sisters have to
[1:36:11] dedicate their body to the Lord but
[1:36:14] brothers also
[1:36:16] you don't have the right to go party and
[1:36:19] come back and impose people who you want
[1:36:22] to marry
[1:36:25] daddy catch your morass
[1:36:28] what do we mean by morass
[1:36:31] brother Stephen you teaching the zodiac
[1:36:33] what do you have to do with this
[1:36:36] it's the misery
[1:36:39] thirsting for life I will come about go
[1:36:42] back to that code woman was made woman
[1:36:47] for a man not woman made men God does
[1:36:51] not make mistake that's a provision
[1:36:54] woman was made woman for a man man was
[1:36:58] not made for women woman was made for
[1:37:01] man not man
[1:37:03] look at what rebel a machine not men
[1:37:07] many of them in other word not pure but
[1:37:15] cellular
[1:37:16] sister you are made for one man
[1:37:21] clear that's right but when they shall
[1:37:26] Demarest when they scandalized
[1:37:29] themselves who is talking to the sister
[1:37:33] and man the same thing you two brothers
[1:37:37] you are providing the vehicles that God
[1:37:42] made you a woman or a man
[1:37:47] then you call that life its death

[1:37:56] your name on the church and become a
[1:37:58] church member leave like the world come
[1:38:01] to church play instrument come to church
[1:38:04] sing in the church living any kind away
[1:38:06] whether you are sister or a brother

[1:38:16] intended you to be
[1:38:20] the first that putting you to be like
[1:38:23] him and to love him and test after him
[1:38:27] let me give more clarification then we

[1:45:50] contacted with that center you can
[1:45:53] create earth the power of the spoken
[1:45:58] word lies in clasp
[1:46:01] louia do anything and the power will be
[1:46:06] limited so young men collect yourself to
[1:46:10] Christ young sister connect yourself to
[1:46:14] cross brother daddy lonely connect
[1:46:17] yourself to Christ and that class will
[1:46:20] give you that unlimited power you are
[1:46:22] talking about the third pool everybody
[1:46:24] clear so now as you be glow by the 12
[1:46:28] Sun we all care what it you're on a time
[1:46:30] okay when we look at the 12 Sun I want
[1:46:35] to buckle up pretty good here that was
[1:46:38] maybe an appetizer this is deep so make
[1:46:43] sure you got yourself pretty good if you
[1:46:46] need the move move around if we were in
[1:46:48] school I give you ten minute break so
[1:46:50] shake around and we go when you look at
[1:46:53] the twelve star sign of the zodiac
[1:46:57] we spoke about the virgin we already
[1:47:01] explained that the Virgin spoke about
[1:47:03] the first coming of Christ Christ have
[1:47:06] to be born by a woman by a virgin then
[1:47:09] we also spoke about Leo de Lyon we was
[1:47:13] the second coming of Christ but keep in
[1:47:16] mind when you look at a star you are
[1:47:18] looking at the scripture when you're
[1:47:20] looking at the Sun of a constellation
[1:47:22] you are looking at it scripture are you
[1:47:25] there because the Bible was written like
[1:47:27] that are you there so when you look at
[1:47:30] the virgin it's a scripture when you
[1:47:33] look at the lion it's a scripture
[1:47:36] everybody clear so after that we just
[1:47:39] explained to you Aries which was
[1:47:42] speaking about the birth of Christ are
[1:47:45] you there because when Christ came down
[1:47:48] Christ have a reason to come he came to
[1:47:52] Christ the word of the devil are you
[1:47:55] there that's why when Moses met the
[1:47:58] serpent
[1:47:59] when Moses took his Lord God said pride
[1:48:02] on the earth I told you I would explain
[1:48:04] it to you when he had rolled on the
[1:48:07] floor God said not yet - bye
[1:48:11] they tell not the head the head is not
[1:48:15] you Moses in English at all he said
[1:48:19] throw he throw it turned to a serpent
[1:48:22] Moses by Capilouto be God's a showdown
[1:48:25] Moses you are not Christ
[1:48:29] you are not the seed of the woman you
[1:48:32] are only a shadow a type of Christ so
[1:48:37] what I want you to do go by the tail
[1:48:41] not the head why the tail and not the
[1:48:45] head
[1:48:46] are you there in the book of Genesis
[1:48:50] when Adam sinned Eve sinned God come and
[1:48:55] draw his judgment when they were living
[1:48:58] after God clothed them with lamps as
[1:49:04] they were living the Garden of Eden God
[1:49:07] look and he began to it he looked he
[1:49:11] looked and he looked at even he said
[1:49:15] there is a seed coming up and your seed
[1:49:21] would you want to discern
[1:49:25] it will crush the head of
[1:49:28] the serpent not the tail are you there
[1:49:32] so when Moses came he told Moses ah
[1:49:36] don't go to the tail don't go to the
[1:49:39] head that is reserved for somebody it's
[1:49:44] like when then your camera he said what
[1:49:46] does those standards means God said
[1:49:49] Daniel I know you want to know this but
[1:49:52] this is not for your tongue my sweet boy
[1:49:55] sleep there is a time in the end time
[1:49:59] when somebody was appropriate
[1:50:03] predestinated for the ministry when he
[1:50:06] will come automatically the thunders
[1:50:08] will be revealed are you there because
[1:50:11] the law
[1:50:14] there were two trees in the Garden of
[1:50:17] Eden there was the tree of good as Pro
[1:50:20] when look at those tree a tree
[1:50:24] I'm not a good job especially now we
[1:50:29] have a tree going on the earth is there
[1:50:31] underneath we have roots are you there
[1:50:36] then when that tree put fruits you have
[1:50:40] maybe an apple there an apple there or
[1:50:43] there is fruit and if you go to the book
[1:50:46] of Galatians you will see that there are
[1:50:48] the fruit of the Spirit are there and
[1:50:51] they are also the fruit of the work of
[1:50:54] darkness are they stealing murdering
[1:50:58] whatever you see them they are also
[1:51:01] fruit because there is two trees one
[1:51:04] tree produces fruit and another tree
[1:51:07] produces fruit and Jesus say you will
[1:51:09] recognize a tree by its fruit so what
[1:51:14] Moses came
[1:51:15] closest brought the law are you
[1:51:18] following me and their law was dealing
[1:51:22] not with the problem I'm going slowly
[1:51:26] but the law was dealing with the
[1:51:30] attribute of the problem
[1:51:33] let me repeat myself slowly I don't want
[1:51:36] to miss it when Lock em there law was
[1:51:41] not dealing with the loot
[1:51:45] because the life of the tree brother
[1:51:48] Branham said he stays in the root but
[1:51:51] when they lock him the law was dealing
[1:51:55] with their branches
[1:51:58] multiscale him say don't commit adultery
[1:52:02] brother branham say adultery is not sin
[1:52:07] are you there
[1:52:10] Moses say don't steal cut here when you
[1:52:14] cut across a branch guess what it's
[1:52:17] going to come up again that's why
[1:52:20] they're worshipper when they were going
[1:52:22] to the temple they come up bring a lamb
[1:52:26] put it there Oh Lord forgive me as soon
[1:52:30] as they leave they are living with the
[1:52:33] same desire to do that son finger D and
[1:52:37] one day they come to Moses I don't like
[1:52:41] my wife anymore Moses say brother what
[1:52:43] is going on he said ah I can't stand
[1:52:46] that woman anymore
[1:52:47] Moses look he said can't you just bring
[1:52:50] the de sister we can talk no no no no no
[1:52:52] no no I can't stand that woman anymore
[1:52:54] Moses looked he looked he said my
[1:52:58] ministry is different I'm dealing with
[1:53:01] the attribute I'm dealing with the
[1:53:04] branches there is no way you can control
[1:53:07] a man by dealing with the attribute I
[1:53:11] can tell him to smoke but there is
[1:53:15] something in him pushing him when he
[1:53:17] comes he can even still to go by
[1:53:19] cigarette most salukis day I'm going to
[1:53:23] find something in a jurisdiction
[1:53:26] law to kind of help this man he said if
[1:53:30] you don't like your wife anymore just
[1:53:32] right here a letter of divorce bring it
[1:53:35] to me send her away I'm not tomorrow you
[1:53:37] want to bring another one for marriage I
[1:53:39] want to get married to the second look
[1:53:42] he was not dilated you were already
[1:53:44] looking at another lady you are already
[1:53:46] committing adultery in your mind that's
[1:53:49] why you are looking for a sin that one
[1:53:52] the Pharisee said wait a minute
[1:53:55] Moses called us to give the letter of
[1:53:58] divorce Jesus say I know I don't have
[1:54:01] any problem I am the one who sent Moses
[1:54:04] but the problem the reason is give it to
[1:54:08] you because your heart where hard
[1:54:11] because of the hardness of your heart so
[1:54:16] no matter what Moses can preach unto you
[1:54:18] you will not listen because if sin is
[1:54:22] that dealt with it in there so God told
[1:54:26] Moses don't touch that serpent by the
[1:54:29] head
[1:54:30] that's the serpent by the hair by the
[1:54:33] tail your ministry does not crush the
[1:54:36] head of the serpent you'll
[1:54:38] deal with the attribute the tail of the
[1:54:42] serpent not the head where do you get
[1:54:46] those stuff
[1:54:47] brother Steven where do you get those
[1:54:50] stuff praise God
[1:54:53] brother Adam say
[1:54:56] for instance like this if a big word
[1:55:01] if a big serpent was here or a great big
[1:55:06] something that had me by the side with
[1:55:10] his paw what a Bonham is saying if I'm
[1:55:12] fighting with a big beast or something
[1:55:14] brother branham say and was hurting me
[1:55:17] with his pal maybe it's a bear or
[1:55:19] something
[1:55:20] he said now it's not necessary for me to
[1:55:24] have to cut the animal part off
[1:55:29] but rather we say if you fighting with a
[1:55:32] bear and you cut his now it's not
[1:55:35] helping if you cut his hand you in other
[1:55:42] word you making the animal more angrier
[1:55:45] than you think
[1:55:46] you are not solving a problem because
[1:55:49] the threat is still there are you there
[1:55:53] if you cut the tree Moses it's not
[1:55:57] helping if you tell them don't smoke
[1:55:59] it's not helping if you give them a
[1:56:02] bunch of commandment
[1:56:04] it is not helping you just make their
[1:56:07] life miserable they are thinking like
[1:56:09] they are in prison they are thinking
[1:56:12] like believing this message they are a
[1:56:14] certain bond of rule about the message
[1:56:17] don't just like this conscience like
[1:56:19] this they presented to you the message
[1:56:22] in the wrong way they presented to you
[1:56:25] the message like legolas
[1:56:28] take the heart change the heart then the
[1:56:33] bed then the burden of crust is light
[1:56:36] then oh I need to dress right oh thank
[1:56:39] you sister what did you say my my dress
[1:56:42] was a little bit tighter thank you
[1:56:44] sister next time I will change it it's
[1:56:45] not a problem if ITIF you not born again
[1:56:48] when the Sailor dress is that I don't
[1:56:51] want to come in that church they think
[1:56:52] that the only holy one
[1:56:54] under Moses are you there oh my god but
[1:56:59] if something hits him in the head
[1:57:03] I'm leaving mother panel and
[1:57:06] kill his head that killed him all over
[1:57:12] are you there and when Jesus atone for
[1:57:15] sin I'm reading brother branham he kills
[1:57:20] him
[1:57:22] it's attribute
[1:57:24] that's one when he died because he said
[1:57:28] it is finished that Chicago that the law
[1:57:32] was not able to deal with it it is
[1:57:34] finished
[1:57:36] hallelujah he killed the serpent from it
[1:57:40] I
[1:57:42] hope you had people here if you can see
[1:57:45] the code he killed the serpent from its
[1:57:49] head do you believe that that's true
[1:57:53] then if he atone for steam he atoned for
[1:57:58] sickness because sickness is secondarily
[1:58:03] coronaviruses nothing
[1:58:06] I'm gonna get to karana
[1:58:09] an attribute of sin our worry our
[1:58:15] trouble our field
[1:58:17] all those things are ultra beautiful sin
[1:58:21] oh
[1:58:23] my god
[1:58:25] the fundamental foundation of faith you
[1:58:28] cannot deal with sin on any major
[1:58:32] without dealing with sickness for
[1:58:34] sickness is an attribute of sin you can
[1:58:38] touch sickness or see more without
[1:58:41] dealing with sickness and all of its
[1:58:43] atrophy for sin is the man in other word
[1:58:48] the big start is sin kills him take care
[1:58:53] of the other one are you there it's the
[1:58:56] head of the serpent
[1:58:59] that's why he told Moses not the head
[1:59:02] that's not your ministry your ministries
[1:59:05] the law God touch that serpent by the
[1:59:08] tail I'll
[1:59:11] kill the head you have actually killed
[1:59:15] the body and you can kill it at the head
[1:59:19] without killing the body so if he just
[1:59:23] come to heal us and not save us we could
[1:59:27] have something to say about salvation
[1:59:29] but he come to deal with salvation for
[1:59:32] their soul which is the head
[1:59:36] from the heart that's why Moses say give
[1:59:40] them later of divorce cross say I know
[1:59:43] why he gave it to you because Moses was
[1:59:45] not dealing with sin from the soul a
[1:59:48] better come I am the Lamb of God I am
[1:59:51] the perfect land I'm coming to deal with
[1:59:54] him at the very root that's why when
[1:59:57] John the Baptist came to introduce Jesus
[2:00:01] Christ John the Baptist say the answer
[2:00:04] is Linda in the root in other words the
[2:00:08] ministry that is coming up he won't cut
[2:00:11] the branches anymore it's gonna cut the
[2:00:13] root it's going to deal with sin in it's
[2:00:16] very problem oh
[2:00:19] my god
[2:00:21] praise the Lord
[2:00:23] we saw the dragon with its tail drew the
[2:00:27] third part of the heaven of the star of
[2:00:29] the heaven you know what that was
[2:00:32] now his tell was not like a forked L
[2:00:35] like they say they dare for his gun he
[2:00:38] was that tell da ly
[2:00:42] not happen in the Garden of Eden are you
[2:00:45] then let me see if I can skip something
[2:00:49] brother branham say I said that's
[2:00:52] nothing unbelief is see that is the
[2:00:56] attribute of sin you don't do that
[2:00:58] because you don't believe we talk about
[2:01:02] they tell being the line right what
[2:01:04] about them say because you don't believe
[2:01:06] on Jesus Christ that makes you then you
[2:01:08] can lie you can still all of that that's
[2:01:12] why they told Moses don't touch it touch
[2:01:15] the other one so we enter by the Virgin
[2:01:18] you understand Leo DeLong you understand
[2:01:21] the ministry of the realm and we explain
[2:01:24] to you that the Ministry of the option
[2:01:26] was to provide that sacrifice so they
[2:01:29] can spring up the seven churches with
[2:01:31] the emergency are you there then later
[2:01:34] on with under Sun on the top so one two
[2:01:38] three four dealt with we still have
[2:01:40] eight I don't know if I will get to
[2:01:42] we're going are you there so there is
[2:01:45] the Sun there which is the water-bearer
[2:01:50] one time when Jesus came because this
[2:01:53] peak pursued by the coming of Christ
[2:01:54] when Jesus came before his death the
[2:01:58] disciple were looking on the last
[2:02:01] stepper they didn't know where to get
[2:02:03] the supper
[2:02:06] remember your Bible I'm giving you time
[2:02:08] so you can go in your Bible in your mind
[2:02:09] then kill them they asked Jesus where
[2:02:12] are we going to go to celebrate the
[2:02:15] supper because in that supper he have to
[2:02:18] afford the ministry of Judah because all
[2:02:21] this time Judah was a good man Judah was
[2:02:24] a preacher but at that time the ministry
[2:02:27] of Judah have to change from being a man
[2:02:30] supporting Jesus Christ to a man who's
[2:02:32] going to betray Jesus Christ are you
[2:02:35] there so to hit the room and to also
[2:02:38] inform the mystery of Melchizedek
[2:02:41] because Jesus thought that this is the
[2:02:45] last time I am drinking with you wine
[2:02:48] and taking bread I will do I won't do it
[2:02:51] this anymore until I meet you in heaven
[2:02:54] and that was one of the mystery of
[2:02:57] Melchizedek because the key select
[2:02:59] brought to Abraham bread and wine are
[2:03:02] you there so let me just wipe myself up
[2:03:06] so when they were looking for that room
[2:03:09] they didn't know where to go then Jesus
[2:03:13] told them he say you don't have to worry
[2:03:16] you go down some way
[2:03:19] search your scripture in your mind I'm
[2:03:21] giving you town he said you shall find a
[2:03:24] man
[2:03:26] carrying water
[2:03:28] peachwood
[2:03:33] with this message the Bible is a new
[2:03:36] book my brother
[2:03:38] in other words Allah taught me that
[2:03:43] there is
[2:03:44] some where are you dad when you go there
[2:03:48] you want to see it in the Bible are you
[2:03:50] ok
[2:03:51] ok if you need it call me this is not
[2:03:56] the time where we preach and you go home
[2:03:57] you don't understand ah if you don't
[2:04:00] understand call us let's sit down let
[2:04:03] make sure nobody is left behind we don't
[2:04:06] want to leave no children not no uncle
[2:04:09] everybody must go to the rapture
[2:04:13] yesterday I spoke most an hour and 30
[2:04:16] minutes for water baptism and I have to
[2:04:18] skip a lot of stuff we used to do that
[2:04:20] 15 minutes we get you baptized I say no
[2:04:24] more any more this is not just a church
[2:04:26] this is not another message church we
[2:04:28] need to sit down and make sure you are
[2:04:30] grounded brother branham say when Paul
[2:04:33] was preaching and when he got a comfort
[2:04:37] he stand down with that prophet till
[2:04:40] they get the Holy Ghost
[2:04:43] we get the Holy Ghost come get the girl
[2:04:45] go they go nothing come back nothing
[2:04:49] well nothing and then we don't have to
[2:04:51] say coldness in the message no no more
[2:04:53] game are you there so he told them you
[2:04:57] go ahead you're gonna a man with a
[2:04:59] picture that man is gonna show you the
[2:05:02] last room I'm gonna take the Lord's
[2:05:04] Supper I'm gonna fold you that there the
[2:05:06] water girl gives the signal and when
[2:05:09] they saw they saw a mankind what the
[2:05:11] zodiac say already to see this meant a
[2:05:13] long time ago are you there
[2:05:18] now after that we spoke about the two
[2:05:22] twins I'm gonna go with the twins
[2:05:24] because every time from Genesis all the
[2:05:29] way to Revelation we got wings
[2:05:32] brother branham help me
[2:05:34] now therefore
[2:05:36] the great church making itself ready we
[2:05:40] found that Esau and Jacob
[2:05:43] before either child was born God said he
[2:05:46] loved one and he hated the other and
[2:05:49] remember there were twins I mean the
[2:05:53] zodiac
[2:05:54] didn't say mother Sam father get it
[2:05:59] twins every revolver produces twins even
[2:06:05] in the message
[2:06:08] certainly does there is twin born in
[2:06:11] natural men and spiritual men he was
[2:06:14] back in the Garden of Eden can enable
[2:06:17] the same thing started from there just
[2:06:20] keep on down and look at the church
[2:06:22] Jesus the pastor
[2:06:25] Judah the treasurer
[2:06:28] brothers out of the same tribe
[2:06:32] right in the same group same church
[2:06:39] one pastor the other one treasurer one a
[2:06:44] devil
[2:06:46] and one God
[2:06:51] Emmanuel which means God with us that's
[2:06:55] the way he goes Jesus saying the last
[2:06:59] day the two spirit will be so close it
[2:07:02] will deceive the very elect if he was
[2:07:05] possible if he was possible but it is
[2:07:10] not oh
[2:07:12] they shall never do it alright
[2:07:16] if you notice it's always been twins all
[2:07:21] alone can a neighbor we're twins even
[2:07:24] Jacob were twins Judah and Jesus come
[2:07:27] out of the same tribe in the same church
[2:07:29] even the Holy Spirit and the Antichrist
[2:07:34] is to be twins
[2:07:39] the Seventh Seal is opened Christ is
[2:07:42] coming down going the fist of the
[2:07:44] trumpet brother Branham say and opening
[2:07:48] of the Seventh Seal there is a losing of
[2:07:50] a necklace and ecclesiastical spirit
[2:07:53] under that same suit in a it's releasing
[2:07:57] crust it's also releasing the devil
[2:08:03] power of trans men were formation they
[2:08:06] are just like Judas Jesus both brothers
[2:08:08] in their child just like Esau and Jacob
[2:08:11] their crew and the dog even in the
[2:08:15] Noah's Ark
[2:08:17] sitting on the same roost and everything
[2:08:21] is a twin it's great work for it's in
[2:08:24] this great warfare that we are in so we
[2:08:28] are dealing with twins this is where I'm
[2:08:30] going to transition to move to the next
[2:08:32] one we found out that Judah have the
[2:08:35] Antichrist spirit and Jesus have the
[2:08:38] Spirit of God both of them twins and the
[2:08:41] zodiac already spoken look at this look
[2:08:44] at this look at this look at this even
[2:08:47] in the church there is a True Vine and a
[2:08:50] first time are you there watch out so
[2:08:55] I'll leave it alone what Jesus was upon
[2:08:58] the earth so it was Judah each came from
[2:09:02] different spirit
[2:09:04] and upon death each went to his own
[2:09:07] place either Judas a son of perdition
[2:09:11] son of hell Jesus is son of heaven he
[2:09:14] said I come from God I go from God and
[2:09:17] at the same time
[2:09:20] Peter committed a mistake
[2:09:23] but he never committed suicide
[2:09:26] but Judah middle is dead and he went he
[2:09:30] took his life away because his twins is
[2:09:33] living Jesus his living death he has
[2:09:37] also to leave the earth and when Jesus
[2:09:41] was living the earth brother branham say
[2:09:43] there were two sinners and Jesus has to
[2:09:46] happen so the other one has to be backed
[2:09:49] by Judah
[2:09:53] my god
[2:09:55] the spirit
[2:09:57] the spirit of trust letter came back
[2:10:01] upon the true church and the spirit of
[2:10:05] Judah came back upon the four church in
[2:10:09] his right in the revelation 6 and
[2:10:13] what what I begin to read the seals in
[2:10:17] other words brother Branham is telling
[2:10:18] you what happened in Pentecost was there
[2:10:22] spirit Devils in Jesus Christ that's why
[2:10:26] Jesus said it is expedient for me to go
[2:10:28] and then I'm going to send you a
[2:10:30] comforter Judah also has to go to take
[2:10:34] the spirit that was working on him and
[2:10:37] sell the spirit back to the church
[2:10:39] that's why when that spirit come he
[2:10:42] cannot work outside of the church he
[2:10:45] have to come in the church just like do
[2:10:47] you think the at request is already
[2:10:50] there drinking no holiday it's a
[2:10:54] religious spirit
[2:10:58] let me drop down see how Judah spirit
[2:11:02] came back as they rode a Honda
[2:11:05] so the antitrust law that came on the
[2:11:09] white horse when they opened the first
[2:11:11] seal brother branham say it was Judah
[2:11:13] again but Robin
[2:11:16] that's why brother branham said Judah
[2:11:18] once did devil incarnated
[2:11:22] are you there he said see Judah the
[2:11:26] spirit come as a rider on the white
[2:11:28] horse he was white so close to the wheel
[2:11:31] just as Judah was so close to Jesus so
[2:11:36] after the death the death and the
[2:11:39] resurrection of Jesus Christ when Jesus
[2:11:42] when Jesus pour his spirit back in the
[2:11:45] church and Judah also came and pour his
[2:11:49] spirit back again as an antichrist and
[2:11:51] when they fulfilled the world was rather
[2:11:55] which is Judah open up what we see we
[2:11:59] see a horse coming up with what
[2:12:03] check your Bible with a ball there is a
[2:12:08] horse
[2:12:09] amen
[2:12:14] if you look at this son
[2:12:17] it is called the Sagittarius
[2:12:21] the Sun is a central
[2:12:25] it's a creature that is most part men
[2:12:30] with a bow
[2:12:32] [Music]
[2:12:35] this message is very candid in the
[2:12:39] zodiac
[2:12:40] vindicated in the pyramid fabricated in
[2:12:43] the weakened world
[2:12:45] either so the zodiac already spoke about
[2:12:50] the other cluster he said hey look that
[2:12:54] one who come as a rather on the horse
[2:12:58] who is a Judah and when Judah came God
[2:13:04] because he pour his spirit on the church
[2:13:07] he was as the lion anointing if you
[2:13:11] noticed st. areas and lion are on the
[2:13:15] same line
[2:13:17] brother Stevens slow down
[2:13:20] you told us that the lion is the second
[2:13:24] coming of Jesus Christ because brother
[2:13:26] branham say it is the Lion of the tribe
[2:13:28] of Judah it is the second coming now you
[2:13:30] begin to say again that the lion is also
[2:13:33] fighting with the Antichrist spirit what
[2:13:36] are you talking about
[2:13:40] all the Sun our scripture
[2:13:44] in your written word scripture and other
[2:13:48] what I'm saying as this scripture have a
[2:13:51] compound meaning
[2:13:56] he can say this and then he can turn
[2:14:00] around and say this either so one dare
[2:14:05] to cross Spirit came up the lion rose
[2:14:08] again and begin to fight him
[2:14:11] your honor gracefully the lion was where
[2:14:15] do you get this stuff
[2:14:17] Fox you in the first stage was a what a
[2:14:22] long edge there was the Lion of the
[2:14:27] tribe of so Leo the Lion not only is he
[2:14:31] speaking about the second coming in
[2:14:33] spurts also of the anointing that was
[2:14:37] coming down upon the Apostle Paul to
[2:14:39] fight Judah
[2:14:43] the land of the tribe of Judah who
[2:14:46] crushed his own affluence of life taken
[2:14:52] damage the influence not of Judah of
[2:14:56] Christ the six healed this rather he was
[2:14:59] one he was one rather they wrote these
[2:15:03] horses let me drop down here the first
[2:15:06] edge of lion that was the word of course
[2:15:10] Christ
[2:15:12] let me help you up again Paul the Angel
[2:15:16] of the Church of Ephesus
[2:15:18] Paul funding this church being the
[2:15:20] messenger to it are you there and the
[2:15:22] spirit was in the land that time was a
[2:15:25] lying spirit and the lion is the Lion of
[2:15:30] the tribe of Judah which is crust and
[2:15:33] crust is the word Paul with the word
[2:15:37] - oh
[2:15:39] my god
[2:15:41] relax at home we are in deep trouble in
[2:15:44] water now so just hang on we on board
[2:15:47] with Captain Jesus Christ he's the one
[2:15:50] fighting this blood sooner we're going
[2:15:52] to get to the airport - hang on tight
[2:15:54] are you there revelation
[2:15:59] for God's chosen place of worship first
[2:16:02] one was found out was that ion that was
[2:16:06] the first beast that went forth to meet
[2:16:09] the challenge of that day the land of
[2:16:11] the tribe of Judah so when the lion work
[2:16:17] work and the Antichrist could not make
[2:16:20] his way up he flipped the host and he
[2:16:24] got into the red horse then the zodiac
[2:16:28] unfold the Scorpio
[2:16:31] Scorpio
[2:16:33] raddest even a
[2:16:36] scorpion
[2:16:38] scorpion is the battle
[2:16:43] it's just a bad bug but one we won't
[2:16:48] make the Scorpio so special is this
[2:16:51] thing
[2:16:54] if you take this thing off of swamp you
[2:16:58] nobody will feel Scorpio anymore he
[2:17:01] designed to Scorpio they're now running
[2:17:04] away from the bug they're running away
[2:17:07] from this thing the sting is very
[2:17:10] important
[2:17:11] when I rub it wherever you are Paul was
[2:17:15] riding one day he said that where is
[2:17:18] your
[2:17:24] let's go there we then turned by power I
[2:17:29] often said sometime there is where he
[2:17:32] look this thing out of death that is
[2:17:35] where Paul say Oh death where is your
[2:17:38] sting I have been told that many insect
[2:17:41] bees and things they get stinger and
[2:17:44] they are posing with it but one time
[2:17:47] they sting they their senior deaf had
[2:17:52] this thing in it one tom but Christ on
[2:17:56] Calvary took the Stinger out of this
[2:17:59] hallelujah and wanna think of it there
[2:18:04] he pulled the sting out of death for me
[2:18:07] and you all the sting of death
[2:18:11] that's why when it believer die he does
[2:18:14] not scream
[2:18:18] when you see a believer dying the Bible
[2:18:21] said they are sleeping if you see
[2:18:24] somebody dying and
[2:18:26] they're coming to get me
[2:18:28] you are not a believer because crust you
[2:18:32] are not heed I identify with Christ if
[2:18:34] you born again you are identified with
[2:18:36] Jesus Christ he takes your sting out so
[2:18:39] when they've come it's only a vehicle
[2:18:42] taking you to the presence of God
[2:18:46] Paul when he was going to get his head
[2:18:50] kind of watch something they were trying
[2:18:54] to kill Paul God never stopped the
[2:18:57] process of killing Paul but he only took
[2:19:02] the sting of death away from Paul are
[2:19:06] you there
[2:19:07] he said in Roman prison he said death
[2:19:11] where is your sting pointing back to
[2:19:13] cover and days were distinct was taken
[2:19:17] out of death so what does Scorpio say
[2:19:20] when Scorpio comes out
[2:19:24] God said the Ox anointing stem plane and
[2:19:31] brother branham said the Earth's is a
[2:19:33] beast that sacrifices in other
[2:19:37] word when you want to kill him he's not
[2:19:39] afraid it's an anointing that doesn't
[2:19:43] have the sting of death when death comes
[2:19:46] he say welcome that's why when they were
[2:19:49] burning the Christian in the early
[2:19:51] churches they were even singing Jesus
[2:19:55] but he's burning undercover
[2:19:59] and and that's a and he died but he
[2:20:02] they're brilliant gun right here
[2:20:04] everybody few because we are ego we are
[2:20:06] not to look you bring a gun a multitude
[2:20:10] a fight we are not torches
[2:20:12] we re go
[2:20:15] I'm there but one day also and they say
[2:20:19] if you don't win us Jesus Christ they
[2:20:21] cut off your head they say I'm ready
[2:20:23] when they put him there Paul is laughing
[2:20:26] he say hahaha they're gonna cut my head
[2:20:28] Oh death where is your sting I got
[2:20:31] people and they chop him off oh
[2:20:34] my god
[2:20:36] that's your second sure if you spiritual
[2:20:41] I'm already preaching the skills
[2:20:44] are you there in the future but Aryan
[2:20:48] age after the Antichrist gasps settle
[2:20:51] down and coming to that area age the
[2:20:53] little church could not do but simply
[2:20:56] level and another thing the Ox is a
[2:20:59] beast of sacrifice they give their life
[2:21:02] just as freely as they could give it in
[2:21:05] that dark age and they just went right
[2:21:08] in yes or no they didn't mind Danny
[2:21:12] people look and say these people are
[2:21:15] strange it is not the people it was the
[2:21:17] anointing on them that anointing the
[2:21:21] sting of death is out are you there and
[2:21:24] they just went right in they didn't man
[2:21:27] died if he was death that's all right
[2:21:30] they went and died anyhow why the very
[2:21:34] spirit of the age the Beast that went to
[2:21:38] meet him the second horse was an ox and
[2:21:42] a Nazis the beasts of sacrifice they
[2:21:44] weren't done in martyrdom during the
[2:21:47] dark ages are you there he said here
[2:21:50] that in the Dark Ages age they all
[2:21:53] spirit well full work level and
[2:21:56] sacrifice and give their life talents
[2:21:59] Tom Tarzan fell asleep under martyrdom
[2:22:02] and everything when they'd ever found
[2:22:05] out that he killed he killed he killed
[2:22:09] six dead like 68 million it's not
[2:22:12] workable they'd ever change yours he got
[2:22:16] to the Turtles
[2:22:17] when the seal broke when he was coming
[2:22:20] up the Bible say I see the Radha with
[2:22:23] what in his hand a
[2:22:25] balance or what a skill I
[2:22:33] hope you did
[2:22:35] Libre open up in the zodiac
[2:22:39] are you there Libra say don't worry
[2:22:42] sorry you see this curve that's the
[2:22:46] Antichrist he's going to come there with
[2:22:49] a scale a measure of Valley and the
[2:22:52] measure of wheat for measure of that God
[2:22:54] don't touch the earth and don't touch
[2:22:58] the wine brother branham saying if you
[2:23:01] look at barley and wheat
[2:23:05] by the random say barley and wheat are
[2:23:08] they stop they make bread
[2:23:12] either on the other side we are dealing
[2:23:15] with one and on
[2:23:18] everybody if you much bread
[2:23:23] is handled by a baker
[2:23:28] brother of a Taleggio swallowed up and
[2:23:32] that wine
[2:23:34] is handled by a Buckland I
[2:23:38] let you swallow that
[2:23:41] are you then shake yourself
[2:23:45] are you there are you there if you

[2:24:32] okay we got to stop with this zodiac we
[2:24:36] will pick up in out of town let me
[2:24:38] finish that run around and say when this
[2:24:42] Antichrist spirit came back something
[2:24:45] happened he said God said the unknotting
[2:24:49] of men
[2:24:50] under looter and Wesley in order to
[2:24:54] fight it if you notice there are two
[2:24:57] signs day
[2:24:59] we found a clock week on there we found
[2:25:03] the passage there and we have one more
[2:25:06] Sun which is the cancer over there let
[2:25:09] me deal with it we want to deal with
[2:25:10] that another time and show you yourself
[2:25:13] in the zodiac brother Branham in the
[2:25:15] zodiac the bride in the zodiac and we
[2:25:18] deal with revelation 12 and everything
[2:25:19] else are you there now when you look at
[2:25:22] a Capricorn the Capricorn is a creature
[2:25:27] that is hot fish and
[2:25:29] has got he starts as a fish he ended as
[2:25:36] a god oh
[2:25:38] my god
[2:25:41] brother branham say in the world falling
[2:25:44] apart
[2:25:45] they suffer all worship and we spent the
[2:25:48] birthday of the Sun God which was
[2:25:50] Jupiter each one the Sun from December
[2:25:53] the 23rd the first until December the
[2:25:56] 25th it does not change its passing each
[2:25:59] Capricorn I gave you a quote from the
[2:26:04] message what does he mean we found out
[2:26:07] that
[2:26:08] fish
[2:26:11] represent the gospel and first I'm going
[2:26:15] to run quickly represent also the
[2:26:18] believers because when Jesus met Peter
[2:26:21] and after Peter get a big
[2:26:25] what a dolt of a big cultural features
[2:26:29] Jesus said from today I'm going to make
[2:26:33] you fishermen of
[2:26:35] men not anymore of fishes are you there
[2:26:39] so this
[2:26:40] this
[2:26:41] was speaking about the image that
[2:26:45] started as a good edge of the gospel of
[2:26:49] believers but damaged and that being a
[2:26:53] good
[2:26:57] brother branham a god always leave the
[2:27:02] ship to the sudden
[2:27:04] you've well you have seen you have seen
[2:27:07] that in a short time their God will run
[2:27:10] right up there and leadership and then
[2:27:13] he would jump out and let the ship going
[2:27:15] that's what he does he always does he
[2:27:19] was the god that
[2:27:21] led Jesus
[2:27:23] the lamb to the slaughter the Roman gods
[2:27:29] I'm going slowly spirit of Rome are you
[2:27:33] there that's right it is the
[2:27:36] denomination of God
[2:27:38] God represented denomination it's a
[2:27:43] denomination of God today that is
[2:27:46] leaving the innocent sheep to the
[2:27:48] slaughter put their self their name on
[2:27:51] the book yonder and so forth so image
[2:27:54] that started good that stagger with the
[2:27:57] gospel and that H ended up in the
[2:28:00] denomination
[2:28:04] your zodia told you that
[2:28:07] in the Saudis age age of Luton are you
[2:28:12] there because the Bible said I have one
[2:28:14] thing about you you carry a name look in
[2:28:19] your scripture you are living by a name
[2:28:21] that name was a denomination idea it was
[2:28:26] the age of Luther Luther started good
[2:28:28] they judge shall live by faith
[2:28:30] then ended up denomination
[2:28:33] watch they in the southeast churches now
[2:28:37] I just said this era gave tremendous
[2:28:40] growth to the denominational spirit God
[2:28:47] standard good ended up denomination in
[2:28:52] if the Koran tonight - dove I am
[2:28:55] appalled I am of Cephas was exhibited he
[2:28:58] was now such fragmentation of the body
[2:29:01] was deplorable they were living a name
[2:29:05] but we're dead that's why by the venom
[2:29:08] said once you become a denomination you
[2:29:10] are dead are either dead certain linear
[2:29:14] again they died the minute death
[2:29:17] organize the first this is the first
[2:29:21] denomination of repute that came out of
[2:29:24] what hallowed they flee the Catholic
[2:29:27] system they started group instead of
[2:29:30] keeping up they ended up again into the
[2:29:32] same mistake the Capricorn say look it's
[2:29:36] a fish by the end up as a goat
[2:29:39] let me finish with this and then we're
[2:29:42] gonna let you go brother branham say you
[2:29:45] know what man has to leave the ship
[2:29:47] today goat and you know what the God
[2:29:51] leads them to right to the slaughter
[2:29:53] them leadership they don't know where
[2:29:55] they are going so the goat goes up to
[2:29:57] the slaughter and the ship don't know no
[2:30:00] more than to follow a leader so it leads
[2:30:02] them right up in this slaughter then the
[2:30:05] G God jumps over the truck and the ship
[2:30:07] goes and get killed they're good
[2:30:10] they're good and what a long delay
[2:30:14] that's why we don't want a leader we
[2:30:18] don't want a pastor that's going to
[2:30:20] leave us from the message and bring us
[2:30:23] back to denomination because you're
[2:30:25] going to lead us back to the shredder
[2:30:33] let's deal with this
[2:30:35] the cancer and the passage I want to put
[2:30:39] them together because bada branham say
[2:30:41] this is the party sale this is the
[2:30:43] cancer this is the procedure this is the
[2:30:45] cancer you say oh brother branham made a
[2:30:47] mistake slow down you don't understand
[2:30:49] leave the bone
[2:30:51] okay let's get a cancer God call it
[2:30:55] devil where did the word cancer come
[2:30:58] from it comes from Latin word which used
[2:31:01] in medical term meaning a quad using the
[2:31:04] cancer day a crowd that you see along
[2:31:07] the sea sure he gets all them legs I'm
[2:31:11] gonna speak quickly the word cancer is
[2:31:13] crab let's go down here a cancer in them
[2:31:17] days was called a devil there were
[2:31:19] Devils Tormentor okay today the word
[2:31:23] cancer comes from the Greek or the Latin
[2:31:25] rather which means a club they have legs
[2:31:28] that spread forth so brother branham say
[2:31:32] that Leo the Lion we know that he said
[2:31:35] their cross fishes of what we are in now
[2:31:38] they cancer age by the random say the
[2:31:42] cross fishes of what we are in now and
[2:31:44] then he said the cancer age the Pisces
[2:31:48] the two fishes is another sound the
[2:31:50] cancer is another side why is brother
[2:31:52] branham putting them together because we
[2:31:55] already seen Luther you wanna see Wesley
[2:31:58] and separating from brother branham are
[2:31:59] you there that we go from there Diane
[2:32:02] Shabab oh brother Burnham say in the
[2:32:03] zone Jackie start off and running every
[2:32:05] age just before there is across reaches
[2:32:08] which is the cancer age that we are
[2:32:11] living in now he called that for
[2:32:14] cross-species he called that also cancer
[2:32:16] age okay let's separate it from the
[2:32:18] cancer first as Moses was given to son
[2:32:22] so will you be given to son first would
[2:32:25] be that you shall be able to detect the
[2:32:27] disease by the hand taking the patient
[2:32:29] in the right hand and left and if you be
[2:32:31] sincere and pray get them to believe you
[2:32:34] and business you when you pray nothing
[2:32:36] shall stand before your prayer not even
[2:32:39] cancer he spoke cancer that's the only
[2:32:45] disease he said
[2:32:47] among all the disease God spoke he only
[2:32:52] mentioned cancer
[2:32:54] are you there to brother branham because
[2:32:58] there is story not a different kind of
[2:33:01] diseases do you know that
[2:33:03] I'm gonna finish here I won't touch it
[2:33:06] we're going to go to the other side
[2:33:08] okay let me say that then we close we
[2:33:11] want to pick up when Paul was bitten
[2:33:15] Paul came back he say that they bit me
[2:33:19] funny
[2:33:21] that's one if you need the scripture see
[2:33:24] me he said funny - one is Teddy now if
[2:33:31] you go to the Old Testament they lost
[2:33:34] say when you beat somebody you must not
[2:33:37] be someone above 40 so the maximum
[2:33:41] bidding was 40 so when they beat Paul
[2:33:44] for some reason the man that was bidding
[2:33:47] Paul
[2:33:49] stop at any nine
[2:33:52] and we know that the anointing that was
[2:33:55] on Paul was the anointing that came from
[2:33:59] the fluence of the Lion of the tribe of
[2:34:02] Judah
[2:34:04] then Paul came back he says in my body I
[2:34:09] bear the mark of Christ
[2:34:16] in other words Paul was telling you that
[2:34:20] the number of building a gap was exactly
[2:34:25] what Jesus Christ said
[2:34:30] I'm gonna finish you
[2:34:33] this was too loaded
[2:34:36] brother branham say I
[2:34:39] said him see the sister already gathered
[2:34:43] but I wanna say I've seen him with his
[2:34:46] backbeat talking about Jesus to a Pope
[2:34:49] were 29 strap where did brother branham
[2:34:54] know Jesus had 39 strap
[2:34:57] it is not written in the Bible slow down
[2:35:00] a my brother slow down this is not a
[2:35:03] prophet like any other prophet slow down
[2:35:06] are you there they could not put 40
[2:35:10] so they didn't stop at Paul by mistake
[2:35:14] either because the anointing of Paul was
[2:35:18] the anointing from the Lion of Judah
[2:35:20] either
[2:35:22] did you know there is famine non-major
[2:35:26] disease in the world today
[2:35:32] rather fear c'est
[2:35:35] tellement strapped across his back with
[2:35:40] kind of Mantell
[2:35:42] that's why when he died he's saying his
[2:35:46] finish every single category of sickness
[2:35:49] was their body strap we were here so no
[2:35:55] matter any disease that can appear in
[2:35:57] this world it's already in the atonement
[2:36:00] green coronavirus I will say Lord among
[2:36:04] the thirteen on you pull you see
[2:36:06] coronavirus there he was already covered
[2:36:09] there is nothing to fear we are the
[2:36:11] Savior he is the Lord our Redeemer let's
[2:36:14] stop here god bless you brother John
[2:36:21] [Applause]
[2:36:26] I'm sorry I went over I'm already

[2:36:43] hallelujah
[2:36:51] let's sing you're gonna sing Jesus the
[2:36:54] light of the world
[2:36:55] because we have the revealed word and
[2:36:59] the light of it and there's nothing that

[2:38:03] for dismissal let's remember each other
[2:38:05] let's remember to cut the name of Jesus
[2:38:08] above everything
[2:38:10] that's a new revelation for me about the
[2:38:13] stripes and the number of diseases
[2:38:15] but it makes it so much easier
[2:38:19] knowing that there's already an
[2:38:21] atonement made and it's just a name
[2:38:25] Coronas just the name of something the
[2:38:27] devil jesus's name is greater than that
[2:38:29] just as it is with cancer and everything
