a while since i've seen you amen i've seen some of you on wednesday but since like what couple sundays oh blessed be the name of the lord it's good to see everybody this morning amen everybody update with the sermon nobody behind okay praise be the name of the lord just a reminder our house meeting was changed moved from yesterday because of brother dwayne's funeral to this coming side and brother michael i know he's online streaming amen oh my god i hope you're not cold like it's on the outside amen we have to finish with what the tabernacle mean to you today and i'm i put a stop on the caribbean because the lord's willing then next week we're going to get in the caribbean and you will see where you are with god amen so don't get cold because i will show you where you are if it's cold outside you call it inside you're going to see exactly where you are in the tabernacle amen let's go to exodus 26. if you have not listened to hidden life yet you better do it because it will help you out you say you better do it yes it's for your benefit it is for your benefit i already listened to two of them there is one more that i need to listen because by the brand i'm preaching hidden life hidden life in christ and healing life with christ so if you can get all of them together you're already on good ground when we're soaring you're gonna soar quickly amen if not you will be your gps will be spinning and get a habit especially young people i load these sermons i load them with code i load them with scripture and what i want you to do when you go home i know you hear sit down go back and get the note and get your scripture and get your note because one of this day if the lord terry you're going to be a father you're going to be a mother you will be questioned either at your job or something you must be able to answer either by the scripture if you're talking about somebody who's not in a message if somebody in the message then you pull the scripture and you back it up with the code together so that's why we're putting them together if somebody asks you why you don't wear a paint you already have a scripture if they in a message you load it why you don't put makeup it's right there so you have everything together we preach on all of that i even asked brother david to do me a favor on the uh i being i believe it's king hazaris we preach like 45 sermons and we preach about the black dog and everything so if they can change the title so whoever needs a reference about high heel or whatever it is you can go straight ahead and go buy the title and find it quickly amen so just get a habit get a note put it down especially young people you will need one of this day even if you want to witness to somebody you want to bring them to the message you need to know your scripture very well because you need to approach with the scripture first and then went about the scripture then the bazooka is behind that you can follow the prophet let's go to exodus chapter 26 if you're there you can say amen you bear with us about the sound system brother david can you mute you give me one benefit to be in church all right exodus chapter 26 verse 1 moreover you shall make the tabernacle you might be seated with 10 curtains of fine twine lining i already got my birthday present for the year some ex believer god gave that believer an inspiration but they don't want to tell me the name amen so we will be making the tabernacle making the tabernacle with ten curtains you should be aware of that now we've turned curtains of fine lining the first material used is fine lining it's twine because that's the way they made it fine linen and blue and purple and scarlet with caribbeans i'm going to stop here if i touch the kerry beams you're not going to go to eat amen so we will try to pick all four here and clear them up today if i get in the caribbean you'll stay here more hours amen all right because you need to understand what a caribbean means and where do we start with caribbeans so we gotta trace caribbean from genesis and go down this way so you know amen not just reading it and kerry beams no and ten curtains of fine twine linen and blue and purple and scarlet with caribbeans so these color when they mix them together they gotta mix them with the caribbeans anybody care you will see what it means with caribbeans of canning works shall you make them the length of one curtain shall be eight and 20 qubit you should be aware of 28 now and the breadth of one curtain four cubits so it's four by twenty eight and every one of the curtains shall have one measure so as you keep putting them together the 28 doesn't change the four are that but not the 28. the five curtains shall be coupled together one to another you remember this now and other five curtains shall be coupled one to another grace and grace and you shall make loops of blue upon the edge of the one curtain from the sleeve edge in the coupling and likewise you make the in the outermost edge of another curtain in the coupling of the second the picture will help you clarify this clearly 50 loops shall you make in one curtain and 50 loops shall you make in the edge of the curtain that is in the coupling of the second that the loops may hold one another may hold one of another and you shall make 50 touches or hooks of gold and couple the curtain together with the touches and it shall be one tabernacle so the key word here this whole covering here this whole curtain here is a tabernacle so when you talk about the tabernacle you're talking about this curtain if you remove this curtain there is no tabernacle every other curtain that was put on top of this was a covering upon the tabernacle anybody here so far amen go to verse seven because somebody's giving me a glance that i'm not catching it let's go to seven and you shall make curtains of goat hair we will get to that later to be a covering upon them in other words upon this everybody here so this is the tabernacle when they say the tabernacle this is the tabernacle and this tabernacle is not the entire tabernacle ever care because the tabernacle have three parts but the way the tabernacle was built it was not built like we usually showed that the tabernacle was built like this everybody here this is the other coat so when you get in the other coach you can go all around everybody here but the true tabernacle is this one this is the terminal anybody here so when you go to the book of hebrew you will see paul talking about the first time in alcohol in the second time in alcohol when we get into the caribbean you're gonna see that clearly i know we usually do this to make things easier for you like this but truly this is the way it is amen okay praise be the name of the lord let's go to esther chapter 4. so when they tell you that they put a covering or they make this tabernacle what they were actually making was this they have to put wood and ovulate them with gold and everything then discovering was going all over and that covering was called dead tabernacle so when they say cover the tabernacle that's what it means the other they will tell you it's a good uh hairs or a ram skin or something like that but this specifically is a tabernacle let's go to esther chapter four if you're there you can say amen you should be now good and familiar and comfortable with the book of esther verse 11 and all the king servant and the people of the king's province do know that whosoever whether man or woman shall come to the king into the everybody and we know that in the tabernacle we also have an inner court because this was the other court anybody care then this was the holy place every care and this was the holiest the holy of the holiest that is the intercourt inner coat back here so what esther is telling you before you get here because in the inner court in the tabernacle that's where the ark of the covenant was and on top of the ark of the covenant we have the mercy seat and the mercy city where the pillar of fire was sitting so when the pillar of fire entered the tabernacle he's going to pass through here pass there and go in between the two caribbeans you see now into between the two caribbeans and in between there that's where the pillar of fire sits so when you enter the inner court the one that you see there is god amen so the one that you see sitting on the throne brother branham said the mercy city is a throne and if we talk about a throne we're talking about a king everybody so nobody can enter into the inner coat you see the book of esther got a tabernacle amen mickey amen and all the king's servant and the people of the king's province do know that whosoever whether man or woman both of them anybody care shall come to the king into the inner court you can play all you want on the outside the problem is into the king everybody here if you're not there lord's willing on the coming sermon i'm going to show you what is your characteristic what is how what are the symptoms of somebody who's not in here what are the symptoms of somebody who's here how would you know that you're here and how do you know that you're there and it will determine your step in christianity amen and you will see why certain things linger on your life and you don't get delivered it is just it depends on where you are and back here you see certain habits don't go ever here but you're still a good christian but certain habits don't go there is something that is there there is a place that you are standing that's what is causing you the problem and as long as you don't move forward from that spot the habit will never leave you and the more you linger you can get in trouble because the only way for you to be safe is if you enter the outer court and you die there then you can go to heaven amen did you hear me if death struck you here you can go to heaven but if death doesn't strike you here and you still alive it's a dangerous ground you don't stay there amen amen let me help somebody if you are at the cross did you get it and there is no way to baptize you you already crucified with jesus christ as long as you accept christ there and you die jesus christ can rescue you from there and take you to heaven anybody here because that's the last chance that you have before death that's why people go to the hospital before they die they give their life to god and they go to heaven but if you are alive that's the problem that's where the problem is if you are baptized and you're not dead that's the problem you cannot stop ready you need to keep moving if not denomination is coming to you everybody here once they denominated you then you're dead amen don't worry amen you will get to that i'm doing this so he stir you up amen whoever woman oh man shall come into to the court to the king into the inner court who is not called you must be called anybody here so not everybody will get there who is not called there is only one law of his to put him to death except the only exception such to whom the king not the prince did you hear me not anybody he must be the king himself amen only the one who the king shall hold out the golden scepter because the golden scepter is only at the end of the king amen anybody here so your justification must come by the king yes sir because when you enter you are already guilty somebody needs to free you but there is nobody that can free you but the king himself with the golden scepter anybody care that he may leave but i have not been called to come into the king these 30 days we will find number 30 down the road when we talk about the goat curtain let's go to romans 1 and then we will pray hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord if you dare you can say amen page is still flipping israel's awakening you got it if you're there you can say a man verse 20 for the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly sin how can you see something invisible god is invisible how can you see god amen being understood by the things that are made so whatever is created he got a message anybody care amen even his eternal power and godhead so that they are without excuse in other words the invisible things of god can be understood by the visible things of god amen especially the one that god pointed you to amen anybody care if god tell you take gold there is something god is talking about he's not telling you really take the material he's talking about something the message in the material and the messages in the material is only a reflection of what you cannot see with your eyes we're clear now let's pray buddy david put me back where i was heavenly father lord we thank you again for your grace your love your mercy and for everything you have been doing for us father thank you for opening the way so that we can come into the service this morning despite lord the rough weather outside we know that one of this day father you will come to pick up your breath and we won't have to go through this kind of weather anymore lord jesus christ when we go through them it's always reminding us that this is not home there is a better place that is better far better than this one lord and our heart our pounding every single day lord father wedding and yearning for that day lord i have done what every human being that you give an ability to do can do this is the best that i can do father and i'm asking that you move me completely out of the way may you come down and speak to your children lord for the anointers anoint the one who is hearing the one who's streaming and lord father anointed the officer in the offices lord father and lord speak to us in the mighty way in the name of jesus christ amen amen god bless you you've already been seated we are dealing with the tabernacle curtain we on part two brother branham says in the statue of a perfect man he said i'm getting started late this morning about 15 minutes early or so then we shall take we shall just take our time now because we don't want to get in a hurry when you get in a hurry then you just ruin the things you were going to say i was listening at the tape the other day as i told you and i got so ashamed of myself not what i was saying by the way i was saying it too fast and it's just a nervous speech i feel like wedding so when i take my time i go slowly there is a reason foul everybody care we went into the level and from the level we are now into the tabernacle when we talk about the level we started in exodus 40 and the level opened up the door about the high priest and his son that we went through left and right back here and the high priest and his son were washed in the left which we know already represented the world and back here and when they were washed in the water they have to be dressed a certain way but it is very important to always remember that who was washing the high priest the one who was washing the high priest and his family was not an ordinary man anybody the one who was doing that was moses as far as human he was ordinary but yet he was a major prophet and back here and as a major prophet he was granted the privilege to wash the first high priest under the levitical priesthood ever here and if jesus christ is our high priest which we already demonstrated and explained it to you jesus also must be watched by a prophet amen amen everybody care and not an ordinary prophet he must be a major prophet uh back here because when we look at moses everything that moses was doing was natural but when the prophet came when jesus christ came we never seen jesus christ himself washing people jesus never went into the tabernacle bringing the people and washing them ever here because when christ came the dispensation began to change they used to take an instrument and sound the jubilee but when jesus christ came jesus changed the jubilee from an instrument into the gospel the spirit of the lord is upon me because he have anointed me to preach the gospel to preach the acceptable year to preach the year of jubilee so jubilee was no more a natural trumpet but jubilee now was a gospel trumpet ever here and when jesus christ also came the washing also changed from the natural water into a spiritual water in ephesians chapter 5 the bible says paul say husband love your wife even as christ also loved the church and gave himself for it that he must sanctify do you see that and cleanse it with the washing of the water what kind of water by the word now the water become the word but you must know what kind of word because the old testament order was handled by a prophet god who in sandra trams and inaudible's mother spoke to our father by the prophet everybody here brother branham said a prophet is a reflector of god [Applause] anybody here so far a prophet is not god a prophet is not an object to worship a prophet is only a son reflecting god but here instead of god speaking god is using a prophet as a mouthpiece that's why the prophet said that save the lord in other words the mouth of a prophet become the mouth of god hallelujah a prophet is a reflector of god he is made so that he cannot speak his own words he has to be god's word that he speaks he's just like a reflector and he is god mouth peace everybody in other words when there is no prophet god is blood do you hear me when a prophet appeared on the scene the prophet actually freed the mouth of god because god now can speak to a prophet according to what happening more horrible [Music] hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord in hosea chapter 6 josiah say i have unioned them by the prophet it doesn't mean that the prophet have a who or maybe a machete that he was using out the people that's not what he means the bible said that i used them by the prophet i have slammed them by the word of my mouth that's why elijah could speak and fire come down it was not elijah killing he was god killing through elijah he was not moses bringing the plague he was god bringing the plague through moses in recognizing your day and its message brother branham say he's interpreting this he said i have you you'd now watch israel he's talking to i have viewed or other word i have chopped chop them out through the water so not only is a prophet a mouthpiece but a prophet by his word he's a tool in the hands of god ever here that is how god does his people he chop them out from the rest of the nation what by his storage sword his water he chopped them his nation from the nations he chop his nation from the nation by the prophet his vindicated water so has he chopped the bread from the denomination by his word promised by malachi 4 in the last word chop out his bride you heard from the rest of the churches you out his water is ewing them by the word of a prophet and the word of a prophet is a message everybody cleared so far everybody cleared so far brother branham also says this that according to the rules of the church in the old testament comer or he's correcting now the new testament rather at the first place that the people enter into the church of god in a spirit of worship and the walking hymns were sung and maybe the preacher would speak for he was a prophet of the church a preacher is a prophet a new testament prophet is a preacher we know that the testimony of jesus christ is the spirit of water so when the anointing of the holy ghost come upon a preacher he's actually prophesying to that local church but we have to understand an order they are in the book of revelation the bible says there was a lamb that have seven horns and seven eyes in other words every horn have an eye brother branham says this he says seven eyes are the seven messengers of the church ages seven i seven water you know seer is a prophet hey the seven eyes eyes means seeing seeing means what in other words seven churches have seven eyes and those seven eyes are seven prophets but i'm call them sometime pastors they are prophets by the spirit of prophecy only two of them are prophet by birth which is paul and brother bronner like moses and elijah everybody okay so far this lab has seven horns and on each horn had an eye what is it it is christ and his brother seven church edges out of there were seven weapons prophet that went fourth seventh years so the last one must be a water so the last one paul and brother branham are not only prophet by the spirit of prophecy but they are prophet by birth [Music] did you hear me hallelujah where are you going to because there is a pattern there is another that preacher must understand in every age we have exactly the same pattern everybody care because when aaron was killing the ball he have to enter the holy of holies and he have to take the blood of the ball and then spray on the mercy seat seven times that was the high priest in the old testament but under melchizedek our high priest is jesus christ but he entered with his own blood in a tub an alcohol that was not made by hand but in the book of revelation we found him with seven stars in his hand ever here because a mercy seat must be sprinkled seven times throughout the seventh church in jesus name here so as that age open he will take one star and he sprinkled the edge and the blood will be do you hear me that's why you heard brother branham say believing world in other words the mercies of god are given to the messenger and when the messenger comes he's opening the door of mercy so that you can enter the kingdom of god once he finished he closed the door and the same messenger take the vow and pour upon the people brother branham said in every age we have exactly the same pattern that is why their life comes through some god-given messenger in a certain area and then from that messenger the messenger our prophet the father foreign ministry are also prophets everybody here and back here we have to understand the pattern of god he moved from the messenger to the far far ministry but here you cannot play with that order but the problem is the firefight ministry must be faithfully taught [Music] they don't want teaching he said in a certain area and then from that messenger they spread the light through the ministry of who so the light of the messenger is spread through the firefox ministry anybody hallelujah who has been faithfully taught but of course all those who go out all those who go out among the far foreign ministry this is the order of god from the messenger to the faithful ministry you cannot touch the firefall ministry and you cannot touch the messenger ever here you cannot play because this is god order to bring perfection into the bride you must get the light and give the light to the fire for ministry and the light of the firefight ministry is actually the light from the messenger and the light of the messenger is the light from god follow me as i follow christ [Music] [Applause] hallelujah but of course all those who go out don't always learn how necessary it is to speak only what the messenger has spoken they add here or take away them and soon the message is no longer and the revival why is the revival dead in message churches check the purity of the message everybody here everybody here how careful we must be to hear one voice for the spirit has bad water the messenger which is the voice of god he warned them that even he paul could not change one word of of what he has given by revelation oh how important it is to hear the voice of god by the way of his word seven of them and then say what has been given to them to say to the water so the seven messengers are prophets the five four ministers are prophets they are prophet under the spirit of prophecy under the prophet of the age amen here so a new testament prophet is a prophet but under the prophet of your age ever here ever care because proverbs say that the spirit of a man is a candle of the lord because in brother in another translation it's called a lamp because when you go in the book of revelation before the throne of god there is seven nights seven candles seven lamps and those seven lamps represented the spirit of men if you need a coach you see me but here that's the reason why under the second pool brother branham always say i'm trying to contact your spirit do you remember that because your spirit is a candle amen it is a light amen the bible says searching all the water in one part of the water that belly is not this belly because john have to eat the book and he was sweet in the belly it was not this belly it is the heart here in other words your spirit is the light that god uses to check your heart amen you hear me that's why even with the woman at the well god have to contact her spirit that's why brother branham have to contact your spirit once he catches your spirit amen he already have the light amen and then with your spirit he goes in your subconscious and then brother branham begin to discern the heart of the people he's using your spirit as a candle as a light to see what is in your heart then he begin to tell you your name is so and so you came from so and so this is what happened to you this is what you have he's contacting your spirit and your spirit is the flashlight he's going into your life because the spirit of man is a light this message is perfectly in line with the scripture so the spirit of a man is a candle jesus said about john he said john was a burning and a shining water you call him a man when jesus looked at him he's looking at the light at fire amen anybody care he said and you were willing for a season to rejoice in his water but jesus also said that no man when he had lighted a candle put this in the water neither under a water but you put it on water how many candlesticks do we have in the church so when god turn a light amen do you follow me it's more vaccine this is the second dosage you follow me do you follow me when god turned a candle up you don't put that candle under the bushes you need to find the candlestick in other words you don't hide the message of the edge do you hear me if there is a church that is proclaiming to follow this message but they don't want to read the code under property they are hiding the candle under the bushes get out of that church [Applause] [Music] do you follow me if a pastor doesn't want cut to be read in his puppet and he's still coming to be part of this message he's trying to hide the candle telling pastor pull the candle up put it on the candlestick [Music] hallelujah that's why we are not a shame to talk about brother branham we are not ashamed to talk about this message where brother braddon sent the truth we will tell you where he lied and repented we will tell you we will tell you everything about him because paul said i have not shunned to declare you the whole council of god everybody that's why the bible says brother branham said the bible say brother brown i'm saying the bible is our reference then brother brandon back it up anybody clear everybody you don't put it or that you put it on the candlestick that they which come in may see the water but the light is the message you are hiding the message how are people going to see the light when you go to your job you become the light you become the message and when the people see you they can see the messaging they can see the message by your life they can see a message by your character they can see the message by your love they can see the message by the way you talk now it's no more a cut it becomes a person a living being because the message is a person [Applause] you can carry this bible all you want to work you won't attract anybody if your life is wrong for somebody to ask you questions about the bible they must see how serious you are for somebody to test about the message you gotta show them the message yourself everybody here because the light of the body is the water and the eyes are the seven messengers that's the light of the body of that age that's the light of the body but here jesus said either what woman having 10 pieces of silver if she lose one piece do not write a what you want to find what you lost you need a candle [Applause] anybody care you need a candle you need the word you need the message and the message will light up your life and then when the message light up your life then you take the broom and you begin to sweep your house you begin to get all the trashes out by the light of the message by the light of the message brother branham say don't smoke out but the branham say don't do this out brother branham said look in the scripture this is out you want to sweep your house you need a light not any kind of light you need the light that was prepared for that age that's why denominations are unable to sweep their life because the light they're using is not god provided life hallelujah and sweep the house and seek water until you water to seek you need the light to sweep you need the light you're using that light to shine on your life and show you the imperfection and then from there you can move on ever here so we found out after that watching that that same prophet comes and dressed the high priest amen you can read it and go but you need to know what did he dress the high priest with john watch jesus christ do you have a scripture where john put the clothes on jesus christ but jesus was clothed in the river jordan another clothes enter that was not there before do you follow me do you follow me the clothing mars is put on aaron aaron didn't have them before so what is the clothing to understand the clothing that jesus got you need to go back in the cabinet amen and to see what was worrying uh what was aaron wearing then you would know what is in christ here because the bible says it is like the precious ornament upon the head because when you look here after moses put the garment he anointed aaron how did they anoint him in other words the garment was mixed with oil but when they wash jesus in jordan what is the oil they put on him what is the garment they were not doing that by any chance they were doing that because of the old testament because they have to wash the lamb but when you wash what are you gonna do the oil upon aaron the bible says that he was upon the head yes amen everybody here so when they bring their anointing on they don't put it on the shoulder i hope you're awake they don't put it on the back they don't put it on the hand the anointing no must start at the head everybody here i hope you're catching it upon the head that run down upon the water the high priest must have built do you hear me so the head of the high priest must come with me [Applause] [Music] this message is in the bible hallelujah upon the build the build of who the high priest must have built so the anointing all when it comes it comes with the head but the head that he builds [Applause] hallelujah and then after the head and the builder sucked with the anointing then the rest of the body can get the anointing all the way to the water all the way to the water to the skirt what is in the skirt [Music] in other words the entire body is soaked by the start with the head and the beard in coronado forest when the picture of the cloud was taken brother branham god told him take the picture and turn it to the right and brother brother begin to give the description not the description of a foot not the description of his shoulder but a description of their head but i'm saying here here is his what why did brother branham have to point the dark beard because the preacher that came was the picture of off-man the head of jesus christ who is the high priest look at the beard the anointing is coming melchizedek is there what do you expect the body to receive because when it sat on the head it's going to go all the way to the body everybody he have to come in the end time to drop that all the way and bring the resurrection and but here he said you see his dark beer dark hair his eyes knows everything just water and even the part of his hair coming over on this side he is who god the anointing all that come upon iron have something to do everybody it comes upon a high priest that have built there is a reason for it and then from there his son also washed a cloth with coats not holy garment why is the difference between these two that's why we're in the tabernacle buckle up we already left the airport hey mark here we were dealing with this first layer brother branham said he's made the old testament in parable in symbolic forms to express himself his self and his doings that the simpleminded might be able to have a conception of his will and what he's done in other words what god was doing in the old testament when he told them build me a temple i want to live there he was giving something he was giving them symbols he was giving them form he was giving them a message of something he's wanted to do everybody many times in the old testament how i have went back to found the old tapping the new always god did and what he's doing now in the new testament he did what he foreshadowed it in the water we told you that this tabernacle represented christ and the temple represented the bride everybody here so this tabernacle is actually foreshadowing jesus christ everybody let me go in the old testament being on top of the new the works of the inward coats of the tabernacle was a beautiful picture of water god's plan of water for his mankind water so what they were doing here in the old testament god was showing how he's saving man that's why we missed god that's why the pharisee the jews miss god because they never got the revelation of the old testament amen amen everybody here how can you sing in the temple my god my god why have that forsaken me and somebody's in the cross singing the same thing but you cannot put the two together how can a crazy man stand up there and say behold the lamb of god why he didn't say behold the man he was telling israel everything that you are doing there this is the real over there it was a lamb over here he was so the lamb walked for foreshadowing somebody hallelujah and if we can only learn by this now how to get ourself in the condition to receive what god has installed for us it shall just sweep the whole valley here if you understand how god operates here hallelujah paul says this that according to the grace of god which is given unto me as a wise master builder show me which house paul built do you have the housing do you have a house paul was making tent i can give you the scripture but paul was not building houses what kind of houses paul was building because in the old testament solomon built god the house and paul is calling himself him a prophet him a preacher he's calling himself a master builder show me the house paul built so what you sow as a house is not really her house hallelujah i have laid the foundation and another build of their own but let every man take heed how he built their own they're upon for other foundation can no man lay then daddy's laid which is who how was paul laying jesus christ when paul is preaching the word paul is calling that i am building i am laying a foundation [Music] here so the tabernacle or the temple the way they were doing that naturally now it's expressed spiritually paul say now if any man built upon this foundation which is a man the man jesus christ upon this foundation how how can you put gold and built on jesus jesus is a man so the gold that you put on jesus is not natural gold anybody care if you build gold silver precious stone wood hay stubble all of these are natural material but paul is showing you that what you saw naturally i'm putting that on jesus what does god mean on jesus what a silver mean on jesus what does hay means on jesus what a stubble mean on jesus and back here that's why brother branham say we are not building an organization i'm not here this morning to build an organization christ never sent me to build an organization christ sent me to build water so what they were doing as a house is not really a house they are building individuals everybody individual to the stature of jesus christ that there might be the powerhouse and the dwelling place of the spirit by his water that same word is bringing the spirit that's why every time they took the ark and they put it in the tabernacle the pillar of fire comes the word then the pillar of fire follow the word and sit on that word emma by his word build up the individual to that place not built an organization to a greater denomination but build the individual to sons and daughters of god that is the idea so whatever was built here by moses because god was dwelling in the pillar of fire and god wanted to dwell among his people in the tabernacle this material was talking about somebody anybody here now what to understand that person you need to understand the material because they material tell you who that person is we were on the first layer which is the final inning taught moses met dead curtain fine lemon blue purple scarlet with caravans all of this is called the tabernacle the measurement we already know it's 4 by 28 because 4 is the number of the earth 4 is the number of deliverance sin entered by a woman sin also must be taken out by a woman that's why the 28th circle of a woman must be there and on the end time on february the 28th for 28th minute telling you i'm coming again through that circle anybody care but he splitted the grace he got five over there and five over there and brother branham said now it's six times all bride time the virgin world time no touch it's a virgin remember a virgin world time just as he entered first by mary he have to bring another fire by the capstone by zero babel another five again for another virgin and the end time that's why the numbers have to be kept four by twenty eight four by twenty eight but here but god's church is not touched by denomination hallelujah it's a virgin born word of god made manifested jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever there shall be no denomination manhandling in the virgin birth of the blood no sir she is commanded by god to come out as such touch not their unclean things become a walter there's a virgin in mary there is a virgin on the end time ever care so far we found at the end there is 50 loops and 50 loops because the ministry of jesus christ started by grace at the end he produced 50 pentecost they are pouring off the holy spirit but the entire ministry of brother branham starts with the holy ghost in azusa street pentecost then brother branham pick it up that's why they have one have to be at the end one started from there the two are connected with a jubilee let's get to this then we let you go home we saw last sunday that the color blue represented the perfect spirit of fellowship the color blue was the perfect spirit spirit of fellowship if we mean fellowship we're talking about two fellows one ship anybody here so somebody want to talk to someone anybody here but to talk to someone you need a spirit and back here and that spirit when he comes is gonna bring both of those person to talk because at the beginning they were in enmity do you hear me because number 10 is a corner number and to be carnal you are in enmity with god ever here so to join you back to god because sin came in the garden of eden and separated man from god you need a blue color hallelujah and that blue also brother branham said that he represents trueness anybody here so we can see here spirit and truth in blue everybody here the bible says you shall not get truth anybody here and the troops shall make you so when you entering in the tabernacle the tabernacle which is a person that person there is a blue color telling you that the one who's gonna be that tabernacle in that person he will have a spirit of perfect fellowship and a spirit of trueness anybody care now to move forward to these colors brother branham says this that there is seven colors yes seven churches seven is complete and god was complete and seven spirit and those spirit where are we okay stay up he amazes me when you sleep amen the first was color afraid perfect love redemption keep that in mind anybody care and how if we had time to give those colors and show that each one of those colors represented gods so a color in the bible is speaking about the purity of god a color speak about the purity of god purity we're talking about holiness that's why you hear the bible say the beauty of holiness that beauty is by colors anybody here brother problem say those colors there is seven natural colors those color represented the purity of god what's going on with the purity of god brother branham said god was in the beginning before there was any light before there was ever an atom before there was ever a star before there was any visible thing god feel all space i already spoke to you about this the circle of eternity and in death was nothing but what pure holiness pure righteousness he was spirit in other words everything that god was was pure it's about holiness that's why the high priest have to put something here speaking holiness unto the lord amen everybody here brother branham continued he said those colors represented the murders of god they represented the motive of god and they represented the attitude of god so when god was telling moses take the blue take the scarlet take the paper god was putting a message god was looking at the database of the true tabernacle who was jesus christ but it was not time yet to tell the people who he was and god used the material because the invisible things of god are expressed and they are understood by the visible things of god everybody so when god was telling moses put the color here those color was reflecting the motive of god in jesus christ the scholar was well representing the attitude of god in jesus christ those colors were showing the purity of god in jesus christ so to understand jesus christ you must understand the old testament because the old testament was a shadow what you see as a man walking it's a whole tabernacle walking says that a three-corner piece of glass yet it's only one piece of glass but in three corners we'll reflect seven colors i'm not going to go there but let me just clear you if you take a three corner glass like this you do that in alarm and you shine a light here when it goes through it's gonna come with seven colors that's what brother branham is saying there is a message right there but let's leave it alone now hey brother brother say that's how father son holy ghost the three corners make sense being one yet to reflect the seven water so the color are also the attribute of god everybody here so when you read blue it is telling you something about god but it's coded when you go in the hospital when they say cold blue you will be looking and say what is called blue or who is gold blue the nurse understand what it means you will see the nurse moving a certain way because god blew to you is called blue but to a nurse there is a message telling them maybe there is an emergency because if a trumpet gives an uncertain son you won't know what to do everybody here and to decode god you need a prophet hallelujah now where we know that blue is the perfect spirit of fellowship and blue is the spirit of trueness of truth we have blue our spirit and water in john chapter 4 verse 23 jesus said but the hour cometh and now is that the true worship shall worship the father in water and in water are we okay are we okay in spirit and in truth both of them together the message is perfectly in line with the scripture for the father seeking such to do what god is looking for worshipping god is looking for true worshipping but you don't worship god any kind of way you gotta understand god in the tabernacle in the tabernacle there was a blue color that is the inside top and alcohol of god amen he said god is a spirit and they that worship him must worship him in spirit and in water because if you don't have these two elements how are you gonna come back to fellowship into the easter coat the bible says paul that christ has redeemed from the curse of the law being made that curse for us for it is written curse is everyone that hung on the tree he was hung on the cross why the purpose is that the blessing of abraham might come on the gender through jesus christ god have a blessing he wanted to give to the jews the jews rejected that and crucified god and because of the crucifixion the blessing went to the gentile in other words the cross crosses the hand of god that's why the hand of jacob were close to take the blessing of the elder the jew and put it on the youngest one he took the cross ever here he said that we might receive the promise of the weapon through what hallelujah we look here let me skip this we look here in second corinthians the bible say all things are of god who has reconciles himself by jesus christ and have given to us the ministry of reconciliation reconciliation meaning to bring you back again something happened that broke the fellowship you need somebody to pull the thing together to reconcile to bring the fellowship back again and that person is trust and he was expressing the old testament in a blue color to which that god was in christ in other words christ was a house christ was a temple he said he saw this temple christ was a tabernacle and god entered into that tabernacle and he took that tabernacle to bring you close to god just like the old tabernacle that god dwell into it but that tabernacle must have a material that reflected jesus christ here reconciling the world unto himself not imputing their trespasses unto them and has committed unto us the word of water so when god said that their true worship must worship god in truth which is the word and the spirit ever once you are baptized with the holy ghost you are carrying the blue color of god and you also can bring that color to somebody and the sinner can be reconciled back to god everybody here the second color is the scarlet color we okay praise god everybody here i don't have to bend isaiah 1 verse 18 the bible say come now and let us reason together say the lord do your sin be as water so scarlet represent your sins is the tabernacle complicated through the opening of the seven seal the bible becoming you [Music] do your sin be as colored they shall be made white as what your sin must be moved from scarlet to snow anybody care hallelujah to snow because what they're looking by snow is the white color which is purity amen somebody's sinner he's not pure we need to bring him back to purity because we came from god thought they were red what is going on brother branham red we always thinks the red is danger signified danger or a life or so forth but read in the scripture signify redemption through the blood anybody okay harlot webb when she put the water back here so how was that the harlot house didn't have an aquamarine color or a lavender color he only have this heads quality and the red scarlet was used to bring the spice down and the daughter put the red scarlet to you it means a piece of clothes that was hanging like this back here so when you go around the city if you look you say yes what is wrong with this crazy prostitute again she have a bad behavior she have a bad reputation and now she's putting a red skeleton on a mirror like a crazy woman what does it mean you know she's out of her mind ever here but one judgment came ever here everything was calling down what seems to be like a piece of cloth here was telling the destroying angel not here not here not here even god when he came to jericho the scarlet caller was talking and said you see me don't touch me and god look he said scarlett that's it thank you raya and rob made sure that her father was there that daddy was dead mommy was there all my children all my siblings are dead ever here what seemed it was not really the piece of material but the message behind the piece of material that message god understood it the angel understood it even hell understood the house of help was prostitution prostitution are you following me are you following me sinful liars drunkers i'm cleanly living room ever here god was coming down to destroy everything that is not clean the spice told her [Music] listen to me carefully take scarlet and put it on your house everybody care so this house was filthy plus scarlett the mathematics of god ever here so when god comes the first thing that struck him is quality before filthy amen why are we okay did i lose anybody hallelujah rahab the harlot when she put the scarlet thread down and all through the bible is a scarlet streak redemption come through red through the shedding of the blood and without the shedding of a blood there is no remission of sin and how that god said to god get this heathen that is all read all over not one spot of anything but perfectly what for god looked through what that's why they thought the web put red like this so when he says let the red struck his eyes [Music] hallelujah hallelujah when the angel come put the red carpet they didn't get it put the red carpet put the right chest let him come and see red [Applause] just to relax you ever care what happened when god looked around everybody here hallelujah before god looked through red and you know what color red is looking to the red red look through red match what puts to scarlet so when god comes looking at scarlet through scarlet [Music] [Applause] what you see as prostitution is actually white [Music] [Applause] everybody here ever here so when god was coming he looked at red the skeleton and then as soon as he looked at scarlet the scene of arabs stood there right and when god looked he said this is there was somebody who's righteous in in in jericho i thought the whole city was bad get away get away get away get away everybody here have try it one time red through red produces water so when god looked through the blood of jesus christ to we who are water we've seen and covered by the blood he see us what [Applause] everybody here that's why you need the blood of jesus christ here ever here that's why the tabernacle have to have the scarlet color telling you i am not only bringing the spirit of holy ghost because he says it is expedient for me to go because i'm holding the blue color if i go i'm going to release the blue color and the blue color will come on the day of pentecost because the 50 loops were blue remember i'm having the blue color i have to go to the father don't keep me here let me go to my father then i'm gonna release the 50 blue color and when the 50 blue color comes on the day of pentecost it's the holy spirit entering on the day of pentecost but i'm not only a 50 blue color i'm also scarlett so when you approach the father remember me put me before you and approach god before me like this ever here that's why we pray in jesus name we approach god in jesus name everything whatever you do in word all indeed do it in the name of water put your scarlet like this and god doesn't see you because when god looked at christ and he looked at you no matter what you done in your life no matter what people know no matter what is in the court no matter what they know it doesn't matter before you make it you are white never done it [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah i'm still good are you tired praise god amen the scarlet color oh my god devil really really really really really shake somebody's hand is there [Music] amen oh my god really oh god praise god i'm gonna get there all right that's where i was wasting your time amen the scarlet in the bible is referred to as sheeple died in water [Music] i have other sheep i am the good shepherd amen blood the red meaning our redemption the scarlet war was to be thrown in with the heaven and the cedar would speak of the cross you see and the cross the cross see the wood is white and got red stricken and the white speak of the righteousness of the cross and the red speak of the blood that was made at righteous the cross was a curse until the blood of jesus christ poured down on him then we embrace it to our heart for it is the righteousness of god the bible say in the book of proverbs that a virtuous woman for the 31 she is not afraid of the snow ever here spiritual snow ever care for her household for all her housework are clothed with water a wise woman built her house sister built your house [Music] tell your husband go with the bubble tell your husband shut your telephone down it is time for prayer [Applause] tell your husband we need to go to church tell your husband i must be in church on time tell your husband i don't want to miss church make sure your house is closed with scarlett [Music] [Applause] tell your husband when he gets his paycheck pay [Applause] [Applause] i don't want to curse in my house i don't want no trouble in my house i want to have my house to be clothed with scarlett [Applause] why you didn't come to church it is my husband why are you led to church my husband your husband is the one making everybody late every day i will get in the tabernacle i will get in the tabernacle he's the one taking a shower he doesn't want to come to church you know how to drive get in your car go to church for the salvation of your house brother stephen he is not spiritual you are prepare your house your husband not spiritual you get along with your husband and you are condoning what your husband is doing how are you building a house with a wise woman amen hallelujah why would brother branham say that is the way a sinner does get away from the s.o.n well this is the s-u-n and when it's out there death struck it there winter it kills everything go outside check the check check all the trees there winter when it comes make sure your house have scarlet when the deaf engine was coming get the blood of the lamb put on the lentil of the dog so when they looked through red because israel was not perfect but their perfection was through the red of the blood then they look at them god move up and go to the egyptian and kill him ever here oh that the winter killed the sun restores returning of the sun what does he do he forces listening forces death when the sun the spring sun come back in line on the earth again he actually forces death to give up it's it's dead to a resurrection to a restoration a restoration again wise woman built your house your husband is not strong spiritually help him hallelujah tell him bob remember we cannot work on sunday if he's working on sunday by default you put your knees down say god i want to be in church please bless my husband give him a better job so that we can be in church on sunday to bring the scarlet to all your households because winter is coming [Applause] here hey mark here let's go we got the blue we got your blue we got your scarlet let's go to find the lennon hallelujah in the book of revelation chapter 19 the bible say let us be god and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the lamb is come and his water has made herself and to her the wife was granted that she should be a rare in water which are water you okay for there is the water so the messiah who was coming was bringing you the blue color he had the holy ghost which is the spirit of truth and the spirit of perfect fellowship to bring you back in perfect fellowship he had scarlet in his bag because he must bring you the price of redemption so you can enter god he also have your righteousness amen the tabernacle curtain hey mark here where are we going brother stephen hallelujah brother branham say if by one man offense death reigned by one everybody is dying because of one man adam much more than which receive abundance of grace and of the water so righteousness is a gift amen righteousness where am i at righteousness righteousness according to the scripture righteousness is a gift do you earn a gift no no no it is only anybody care paul continued and the gift of righteousness shall reign in life by one who that's why the temple must be in fine linen telling you the one who is coming the one i'm gonna dwell in him to be able to dwell among humans he will have blue but that blue that i gave in the tabernacle it's only a signal to tell you i will fill him with the spirit that scarlet is to tell you he's the one that is bringing your redemption that fun lana needs to tell you not only the redemption but also in him he have a gift for you and that gift is the gift of righteousness everybody paul said therefore as by the offense of one judgment came upon all men to condemnation even so by the righteousness of one the free gift come upon all men unto justification of what for us by one man disobedience many were made sin so by the obedience of one man shall many me bread water [Music] it is important to remember that before you enter into the inner coat the king himself must give you the golden scepter everybody so that righteousness cannot be by anybody it must be somebody who is a king anybody here brother branham said this that scarlett also represented royal hallelujah brother branham says scarlet also represented royo hallelujah he said the scarlet the colors call it means red he said what does the word scarlet detect it detects royalty [Music] in other words the one that is coming is not just a human being it is the king himself that's why they were calling him where is the king of the we have stealing his star we are coming to the water to worship a king everybody here brother branham also say that he detect royalty royal royal royal see the king and why are we not a denomination brother branham said that the woman was arrayed in purple which means what [Music] brother branham says that royal royal is both purple and scarlet where did you get that brother brother did he give you a scripture and they strip him and they put on him and when they had plated a crown of water so they were crowning jesus as a king ever here but instead of them putting a normal true crown on him they were mocking him everybody but they were not really mocking him everybody care because the crown they put on him was the crown of thorn [Music] everybody because when he came as a king you follow me in his first coming he's coming as a king redemption as a king redeemer ever here he cannot wear his true crown do you follow me it is when he come in revelation 19 ever here that is coming as a choking with all his power do you follow me but as he comes from redemption he must have a crown but in redemption is to bring somebody back to what they're falling because he's coming with the scarlet color hey because when adam if sin adam came and adam detected and he looked he said if god comes he's going to kill my wife everybody here and he's going to left me alone but i only remember when they created me there was only one woman and she was part of me i cannot lose her so adam deliberately we will get to that down the road deliberately he did what was wrong because adam was in the image of god that's why the bible said now man has become like one of us brother branham said watch he never say woman become only men that was adam and berkia so when god came he looked adam because eve also have the name of adam when god looked at adam he was supposed to strike adam but when god looked at adam it's him he can't kill his own son hey in other words he took a whooping he looks [Music] ever clear ever here i don't care so when god look at adam adam say it is the woman that you gave me you know what i did right i knew it was wrong but i did it so i can save her god look he look and and the wrath of god is still burning god had to put a raft somewhere [Applause] do you know where he took the raft and he slammed it on the floor he said cross videogram ever here he said you ground turn will come out of you do you know that scripture do you know that scripture how many knows the scriptures where's your hand do you know the scripture ever here he struck it on the earth and the earth brought tone so when he's coming as king we demon they have to remove the curse [Applause] [Applause] hallelujah is he delicious hallelujah they have to take the curse the curse over there and put on him as a crown they were not mocking him modern events are made clear by the scarlet robe with the curse of the earth [Applause] hallelujah do you know that curse was made hard on who on the job of adam that's why when you're going through a hard job tell god you took the curse i cannot suffer with this supervisor [Applause] my job is supposed to be easy the bride is living below her privilege he already took the curse of your job [Applause] he proved it to peter peter work work work nothing he said peter i am the one who's removing the curse of a job i work there i found nothing go back again throw the net let me show you how easy it is hallelujah your life should be stress-free you gotta know who you are he didn't wear that tongue for nothing it is the blessing of redemption [Applause] hallelujah i'm still okay on time amen he said when they read on his right hand why did they give him a read because a king must have ah everybody a creed on his right hand and they bow their knee before him and mock him saying what yeah do you see why brother branham said scarlett means king but brother branham say also purple in john the bible said they planted a crown of tongue and put it on his hand and they put the water which one is true [Music] [Applause] do you believe the bible [Applause] brother branham say here brother branham say here it is different tell me which one say the truth but forever [Applause] [Music] purple king by scarlett why a king why a king why a king why royal hallelujah jesus said for i say unto you that except your water shall exceed the water after so there is two righteousness hallelujah there is two righteousness my friend there is a righteousness by religion [Music] there is a righteousness by religion which is covering amen that's why adam put the fig tree but he was still hiding before god how can you be covered and hide so he knew that righteousness could not stand before god and mark here and there is a righteousness that is by christ here hallelujah he said accept the righteousness your righteousness exceed the righteousness of the scripture and the pharisees that's what grass found ye shall in no case enter into the kingdom of god their law was not enough to put somebody into the presence so king muscam in royal and in purple in scarlet and in purple and fine lemon all of them mixed together and right here to bring you a righteousness that is higher than the righteousness of the law hallelujah that's why paul said for being ignorant the jews being ignorant of god's water and going about to establish their own water they have not submitted themself unto the righteousness of god so when jesus christ was coming he was the fine land and in flesh telling them i am your righteousness but the jews didn't want that they want their own righteousness and he said listen if the righteousness that i'm giving you if the righteousness you have is not higher than that you cannot enter in heaven ever here that's why all the old testament said when they die they went to paradise nobody saw god because the righteousness that was coming from the law was not enough for them to enter because he was under the blood of god balls and goats everybody oh my god the bible said in genesis 49 that deception shall not depart from who which crowd did jesus came out why does he have to come from judah because he must drop from judah and go in judah and say give me the scepter he belongs to me he have to enter judah to pick up the royalty to take it away from israel anybody here now i can put whoever i want where the jew or gentle if i stretch the septum they're going to enter the holy holy anybody here he said no the lord given from between his feet until shalom come so when shallow come the scepter will depart from judah he will move out of judah before shallow depth it could stand and eat the bread and tell the people you're not priests follow me but you are not david do you know follow me you're hungry right two choices either you die or you eat get the bread eat i'm still alive you need some more david you're telling them there is somebody coming up from judah [Music] and that man even though he's not under the levitical priesthood he can enter in the tabernacle and take stuff and god you call god you say god look at him god turn around and say god look at him say you don't understand who's taking the stuff he said number they say i shall see him but not now i shall behold him but not now they shall come a star out of jacob an acceptance shall rise out of israel that scepter now is not a reader it's a person everybody here paul say but unto the son he say that throne oh god is forever and ever acceptor of what is the scepter of what that's why esther said there is only one law if i enter there it's death but i'm gonna enter because that husband there is my husband and when he get there when he look at esther bring me the scepter [Music] ever here enter enter amanda it's a royal scepter that's why paul said for he has made him to be sin for us him who knew not sin that we might be made the water now you have the right to enter god oh my god philippians said that i might be found in him not having my own water in other words when you enter god grab jesus with you hallelujah which is the law but that which is through what of christ the righteousness which is of god by what but of him are ye in christ jesus who of god is made unto us what jesus is your wisdom and what jesus is your righteousness and what jesus is your sanctification then water that's why the color must be mingled together the red the purple and then and then they have to put it together it's one person hallelujah let's get purple and we can stop here the caribbeans will pick it up next time hallelujah brother branham say that we realize that the odd lord was that a son was born in home he was a son but the tutor raised him and then when he was of age if he beat the right kind of son he was taken out put air on a ceremony and water so purple also means adoption amen so the man who's coming is your wisdom is your righteousness is your sanctification he's your scholar he's your holy ghost he's your truth because jesus said i am the way the truth i am my father hallelujah and that is what he is trying to do to these full gospel people now to get them out to themselves somewhere along with you in faith to adopt them into the kingdom and give them the right to go forth [Music] purple is also your adoption jesus paul says for ye have not received the spirit of bondage [Music] everybody again to feel like esther they're gonna kill me no more but you have received the spirit of what that same spirit that is coming up is built into him with adoption hallelujah whereby we cry our father the spirit itself bearing witness with our spirit we're gonna see that later how your spirit and his spirit are talking amen that we are the children of god if children then heals health of god and don't have with who that's where your purple is coming from if so be that we suffer with him that we may also we glorify together galatians because he are son god has sent forth the spirit of his son in your water crying water wherefore there are no more servants but a water and if a son then an heir of god through who [Music] oh my god brother branham says this after you are adopted all right after you are adopted you are placed then you understand after the ceremony said and you have been put into the body correctly you are a sun sure and a daughter when you are born again you are that that is your birth but now you are positionally placed so not only is he bringing the blue color to baptize you to give you the holy spirit to bring you imperfect fellowship back to reconcile you back to god amen he's also building you up so he can also adopt you everybody here we receive not the spirit of fear but we receive the spirit of adoption whereby we cry our father which means my god that's why jesus was saying my god my god why have they forsaken me abba abba hallelujah we know that the grace was spread into 2-5 we have the first five and the second five and when he come on the first five he brought the purple with him adoption when he comes here they gotta be adoption how was his adoption here the bible say after six days so it must be it might be the seventh day oh no brother stephen i can argue that after six days maybe seven maybe eight maybe nine maybe ten right so we need to narrow our window let's narrow that amen after six days jesus taken peter german jones his brother and bring them up into a high mountain empire and one strange figure before them and his first did sun shine as the sun and his remnant white as the light while he had speaking behold a bright cloud of a shadow and a voice out of the cloud say this is my beloved son in whom i am where please so the adoption under the first grace came up in a mountain with a cloud and a voice anybody here now we say after six days somebody argue with me i can say nine i can say ten in luke chapter nine verse twenty eight the bible say and it came to pass a bad next day so no more none no more 10. so we have between six end of six and about eight not eight not six so there is only one number left [Applause] this message is crushed hallelujah so no more arguing which number is it seven seven is after six anybody here but they say about the east so it must not be in the morning [Applause] [Music] [Applause] hallelujah it must be in the evening [Music] [Applause] [Music] so the adoption happened under the first five after on the seventh day at the evening time that's why in this end time on coronado forest and sunset mountain not sunrise but sunset at the evening time on the seven church edges that's when the cloud comes telling you adoption is back again let's send it [Applause] [Music] hallelujah hallelujah [Applause] hallelujah junior jackson listening in you remember the dream he had that i interpreted going toward the setting of the sun and this happened on sunset mountain it's the evening time sunset time the sunset message through a setting of history a setting of prophecy being fulfilled it shall be light at the evening time upon sunset mountain in the coronado [Applause] [Music] hallelujah hallelujah let me step there hallelujah do you understand now why the first attack brother branham message received is only toward the cloud you see how many cloud is there cloud all over the scripture samsung with seven staff crowd cloud cloud cloud cloud cloud cloud and they keep attacking them or everything even the the vision of brother branham our scripture it didn't happen by any chance because 28 over there 28 over there 28 by 4 28 by four crust crust the tabernacle has your fine linen he have your blue color he have your purple color no he has your scarlet color he's bringing you righteousness not a man righteousness but the king righteousness luther got a glass bottle i mean the glass i mean a glimpse of it but when brad branham say he said truly to be justified means you never done it to begin with amen that's why you stand justify like never done anything because christ have received all of that all of that were hidden in the tabernacle so you pray for me lord willing we need to get now why is this mingle covered with caribbeans let's pray heavenly father lord we thank you for the plan of redemption being unfolded through the message of the hour father thank you for bringing us the blue color that we can now worship you in spirit and in truth lord thank you for bringing us lord

fine lenin you are our purple lord you gave us a righteousness that is more than the righteousness of the pharisee father you brought us into the inner coat where nobody could enter only the high priest lord but the high priest was even afraid because he could face death himself but today as your children with your spirit in us crying about father testifying to our spirit that we are your children we are not entering with a blood of goat with a blood of sheep but we are entering with the perfect blood of the lamb of god not trembling because perfect love has cast out all fear and we can approach you broadly in the time of trouble father to seek for help lord if anybody is in this church that need help lord this morning with their health with their finances with their job with their lord father work any difficulty something you put up all the curses of adam upon you and father if by law what happened to adam happened to us lord by law also whatever you repeat the cross for
