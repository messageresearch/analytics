[34:27] you pull the let's go to our bible
[34:30] amos chapter 3
[34:35] waiting on the projector
[34:38] 270 slider
[34:53] amos chapter 3.
[35:04] verse 6 as the working on the computer
[35:10] if you're there you can say amen
[35:17] shall a trumpet be blown in the city
[35:24] and the people not be afraid
[35:27] because the trumpet have always a
[35:30] message
[35:31] to it amen shall there
[35:35] be evil in the city
[35:38] and the lord has not done it
[35:44] amen the evil you think him and is doing
[35:48] who gave him the seal
[35:52] amen make sense praise the name of the
[35:56] lord
[35:58] hallelujah amen
[36:02] shall there be evil in the city
[36:05] and the lord has not done it
[36:08] surely it's clear
[36:11] not even a game or a guess
[36:14] surely the lord will do
[36:18] something you might be seated
[36:23] surely the lord will do
[36:28] so there is nothing that god can do
[36:34] nothing this is not my program
[36:38] this is god's program there is
[36:42] nothing nothing
[36:46] shall i hide to abraham nothing
[36:51] amen the lord
[36:54] will do the lord god will do nothing
[37:00] but in other words unless
[37:03] or except he reveal
[37:07] his secret to his servants
[37:13] the teacher
[37:17] to his servant the pastor
[37:21] 37 the evangelist
[37:24] to his servant the apostle to his
[37:28] servant
[37:28] the prophet so if you want to know the
[37:33] secret of god
[37:35] you must get in contact with the prophet
[37:41] without the prophet you are blind
[37:46] amen according to god's program
[37:50] he doesn't do anything
[37:53] but he passes through the prophet
[37:56] god in sandra times
[37:59] and his diverse mother spoke to our
[38:02] father by the door
[38:08] amen praise the name of the lord
[38:12] verse 8 the lion has ruled
[38:16] in revelation 10. who will not
[38:19] fear the lord god has
[38:22] spoken who shall not but
[38:27] again the prophet let's go to second
[38:30] corinthians chapter
[38:32] three amen brother david just give me a
[38:37] little bit more
[38:38] i hope i'm not gonna defend someone
[38:42] but i'm gonna blast the devil
[38:50] amen second corinthians chapter three
[38:56] if you dare you can say amen
[39:00] right it's coming okay verse six
[39:04] who also has made us a minister
[39:08] of the new testament
[39:11] not of the letter but off though
[39:15] you need the attack clear
[39:19] for the letter
[39:21] [Music]
[39:23] you want to play with the bubble
[39:31] you want to play with the bible you want
[39:33] to interpret the bible
[39:36] you need a prophet he will kill you
[39:42] for the letter killeth but the
[39:46] spirit gives life
[39:50] amen verse seven
[39:54] but if the the administration
[39:57] or the ministry of what death
[40:04] written and engraving
[40:07] if you notice the ministration of death
[40:11] that killed here the administration
[40:14] was written
[40:18] amen that's why the letter killed us
[40:23] if the meditation of death
[40:27] written and engraved in stone
[40:30] was glorious he was
[40:34] popular he made such a havoc
[40:38] everybody was troubled because of this
[40:40] ministry
[40:42] because death was on the land everybody
[40:45] was crying in sackcloth
[40:48] you caught it now even more the car
[40:51] tore his clothes
[40:54] because of the letter that killed us
[40:59] amen and that letter was written
[41:03] in the name of the king and seal
[41:07] with the seal of the king but that
[41:10] letter
[41:11] killeth amen
[41:15] so that the children of israel could not
[41:19] set fastly
[41:20] behold the face of moses for the glory
[41:23] of his countenance
[41:25] which glory was to be done away the law
[41:28] put you in jail but that glory
[41:32] have to be done away amen
[41:35] how shall not the ministry the
[41:38] ministration
[41:39] of the spirit be rather in other words
[41:43] not the lord not liver but the tribe of
[41:46] judah
[41:46] is more glorious
[41:50] amen last one revelation chapter 14.
[41:55] amen
[41:58] bear with me i believe you should know
[42:00] the story esther 4
[42:02] esther 5 as the 6th you should be
[42:05] familiar with it
[42:06] revelation chapter 14 if you dare you
[42:10] can say a man
[42:12] yeah if you knew in the message hang
[42:15] tight
[42:18] verse 6 and i saw another angel fly
[42:24] in the midst of heaven having the
[42:26] everlasting
[42:28] gospel to preach to them that dwell
[42:31] on the earth and to every nation
[42:34] and kindred and tongue and
[42:37] people now we have one angel they
[42:40] already spoke about the 144 thousand
[42:43] at the beginning now the bible opened up
[42:46] with
[42:46] three special angel the first one the
[42:49] bible says that he have
[42:51] an everlasting gospel everybody clear
[42:54] praise the name of the lord the first
[42:56] one just so we can remember
[42:59] the first danger have an everlasting
[43:05] everlasting gospel who is that angel
[43:10] you want to know the secret go to the
[43:13] prophet
[43:16] verse 7 saying with a loud voice fear
[43:19] god
[43:19] verse 7 and give glory to him for the
[43:22] hour
[43:23] of his judgment is come and worship him
[43:26] that made heaven and earth
[43:28] and the sea and the fountains of water
[43:32] verse 8 and there follow another angel
[43:35] that's the second one
[43:37] saying babylon is fallen is falling
[43:41] that great city because she made
[43:44] all nation drink of the wine of the
[43:47] wrath of her
[43:49] so the second angel is dealing with
[43:52] uncleanness
[43:58] everybody clear fornication
[44:02] coming from babylon amen
[44:05] verse 9 and the third angel so you can
[44:08] see one
[44:09] two three and the third angel
[44:13] followed them saying with a loud voice
[44:16] if any man worship the beast
[44:18] and his image and receive his mark in
[44:22] his forehead
[44:23] or in his hand so the third angel is
[44:26] doing with
[44:27] is dealing with the mark of the beast
[44:36] amen verse 10 the same
[44:40] shall drink of the wine of the wrath of
[44:42] god not the wine of babylon
[44:44] which is poured out with that mixture
[44:47] into the cup of his indignation
[44:50] anger and he shall be tormented with
[44:53] fire
[44:54] and brimstone in the presence of the
[44:56] holy angels
[44:57] and in the presence of the lamb
[45:01] so first of all the lord god does
[45:04] nothing but if you want to know his
[45:07] secret
[45:08] you got to go to the prophet without the
[45:10] prophet you are blind
[45:12] that is clear amen because
[45:16] lack of the prophet that's why we had
[45:18] loose end

[45:23] letter
[45:24] killeth there is death there it is
[45:26] written it's a letter
[45:28] but the spirit giveth life then
[45:31] on revelation 14 we have three angels
[45:33] the first one have an everlasting gospel
[45:36] the second one is doing dealing with the
[45:38] fornication of babylon
[45:40] uncleanness and the third one is dealing
[45:42] with the mark of the
[45:44] disc let's pray heavenly father

[46:30] give us
[46:31] a clear revelation of your word may you
[46:34] speak to us lord father
[46:35] move me completely out of the way lord
[46:38] and take this service for your glory
[46:40] in the name of jesus christ amen
[46:44] praise the name of the lord let's go to
[46:46] esther chapter four
[46:49] that's where we stop last time everybody
[46:52] ready
[46:54] the king of hazards three fists and
[46:57] esther to banquet part nine
[47:02] brother stephen too many parts
[47:05] if i would have stopped in this sermon
[47:07] and give you all of them in one day
[47:10] you won't get it amen king ahazarest
[47:13] three feasts
[47:15] and esther to banquet praise the name of
[47:18] the lord
[47:19] we found out that in esther chapter four
[47:23] where we were last sunday we introduced
[47:26] a chamberlain that was assigned by the
[47:29] king
[47:30] and the name of the chamberlain was
[47:32] attack
[47:34] which when we decode by the prophet
[47:37] we found out that heartache spoke of the
[47:40] holy spirit because esther
[47:43] wanted to know exactly what was going on
[47:45] with mordecai
[47:47] esther approached mordecai in a corner
[47:50] way
[47:50] and mordecai rejected the government of
[47:53] esther
[47:54] and sent the government back again to
[47:56] western then
[47:57] esther remember that there was a
[47:59] chamberlain
[48:01] that the king has appointed to me he's a
[48:04] chamberlain
[48:05] of communication he's a chamberlain
[48:08] of revelation he's a chamberlain
[48:12] that can decode the word and the son
[48:15] of the prophet he's a chamberlain that
[48:18] if he's not there
[48:20] mordecai will never speak to you and if
[48:23] you want to know the meaning of what
[48:25] mordecai is doing
[48:26] if you want to know the message of
[48:29] mordecai
[48:30] you need to get in contact with the
[48:32] chamberlain
[48:33] core head attack so we found out that
[48:36] a communication opened up between esther
[48:40] and modica through the chamberlain
[48:43] and we explained to you that mordecai
[48:46] is the top of the messenger of the seven
[48:49] church ages
[48:50] and then he is also a type of the
[48:53] message
[48:54] because what branham told us that the
[48:56] message and the messenger
[48:58] are one and the same that's the reason
[49:01] why
[49:02] in the message the rapture brother
[49:03] branham said the shout
[49:05] is the message and you go down the road
[49:08] brother branham said the
[49:09] shout is the messenger brother branham
[49:12] did not contradict himself
[49:15] but the message and the messenger are
[49:18] one
[49:18] and the same you cannot separate the two
[49:22] amen so right here
[49:25] we see three people appearing there the
[49:28] first one
[49:29] we have a high tuck which is a top of
[49:32] the spirit
[49:33] everybody clear the second one we have
[49:36] esther which is a top of the bride amen
[49:40] and the third one we have a prophet
[49:44] mordeca which is our top of the
[49:47] prophet so we have the spirit the bride
[49:51] and the prophet and all three are saying
[49:54] the same thing everybody cleared so far
[49:58] now when we look on verse 7
[50:02] of esther chapter 4 if you can go with
[50:05] me
[50:07] the bible says everybody there few
[50:10] people
[50:14] amen and mordechai told
[50:17] him toward her attack amen
[50:22] so on first seven here we found out
[50:26] that there is a verbal message
[50:30] of mordecai anybody following me
[50:34] and mordecai told him
[50:37] all that had happened to him
[50:41] amen there was a letter
[50:44] that was written the letter was written
[50:48] in the name of the king and the letter
[50:52] was sealed by the seal of the king
[50:55] so when they take that letter and they
[50:58] hand it to you
[50:59] if you read the letter you're going to
[51:01] say that king ahazarest
[51:03] wrote the letter if you look at the
[51:05] letter
[51:06] your interpretation will be that king
[51:09] ahazarus was the one that wrote the
[51:11] letter
[51:12] he's the one that have concealed
[51:14] everything within it
[51:16] and he's the one that sealed the letter
[51:19] with his own
[51:20] signet amen so if you take that letter
[51:24] the message of that letter was death
[51:28] anybody clear it was a message to kill
[51:31] mordecai
[51:33] it was a message to kill the jews
[51:36] because
[51:36] all have seen and come short of the
[51:39] glory of god
[51:41] everybody clear so when you look at the
[51:44] letter the letter
[51:45] condemn you to death the letter
[51:49] condemned you to be killed
[51:51] the letter condemned you to be separated
[51:54] from the presence of the king amen
[51:58] and if you take that letter the way he
[52:01] was given
[52:02] and you start preaching with that letter
[52:05] you're going to be preaching to the
[52:06] people that
[52:08] listen to me king of hazarus
[52:11] is saying say amen and the people say
[52:14] amen
[52:15] hallelujah king justice is saying
[52:18] that on the 30th day of the month we're
[52:21] going to kill the jews you say amen
[52:24] you're going to kill the women amen
[52:26] you're going to kill their men
[52:28] amen you're going to kill their children
[52:30] amen and
[52:32] you're going to build a church upon a
[52:35] ladder
[52:35] that can kill you
[52:41] everybody clear but that letter
[52:45] have a background story
[52:50] amen that letter have a story
[52:54] behind it but that story
[52:57] was not written in the letter
[53:00] [Applause]
[53:03] are you following me you can read the
[53:06] letter
[53:07] every day of your life and you will
[53:10] never know
[53:11] the dick to decode the letter
[53:14] you will never know why was the letter
[53:16] written
[53:18] what is the thought behind the letter
[53:20] who truly wrote the letter
[53:23] who is truly after the jews but you
[53:26] won't be preaching to the people
[53:28] a false message
[53:34] are we okay praise the name of the lord
[53:38] he says that and he told him all that
[53:42] have happened
[53:43] in other words there is a story two
[53:46] things
[53:46] on verse seven the first one mordecai
[53:50] told him all that has happened
[53:53] that all that happened was not found in
[53:56] the letter
[53:58] anybody follow me amen
[54:01] and of the sum of what the money
[54:06] that haman had promised to pay to the
[54:08] king's
[54:09] treasury for the jews to destroy them
[54:12] so they later have the sum of money
[54:15] and all that happened but when you read
[54:18] the letter
[54:19] it doesn't say nothing about the sum of
[54:22] money
[54:23] when you read the letter it doesn't say
[54:25] nothing
[54:26] about the conflict between mordecai and
[54:29] heaven
[54:31] that letter have nothing but what was
[54:33] written there
[54:34] everybody read it let's go to verse
[54:37] eight
[54:38] and he gave him a
[54:42] the copy the second part is the written
[54:45] message
[54:49] anybody following me there is a verbal
[54:52] message
[54:53] and there is a written message
[54:57] the verb the written message everybody
[55:00] have it
[55:01] he was sent throughout the entire
[55:04] kingdom
[55:05] of king a hazard everybody can
[55:08] show you the written message everybody
[55:12] in the entire world
[55:14] have the written message but they don't
[55:17] have
[55:18] the verbal or the spoken
[55:21] message
[55:25] let's go to verse 8. also he gave him
[55:29] the copy of the written of the decree
[55:33] that was given as tuition to destroy
[55:37] them so over there it's a copy of the
[55:40] riding
[55:41] let's see a little bit what happened go
[55:44] back to esther
[55:44] chapter 3 hallelujah
[55:48] everybody connected praise the name of
[55:50] the lord
[55:51] esther chapter 3 verse 6.
[55:56] everybody there and he
[55:59] taught scorn speaking of mordecai to lay
[56:02] hand
[56:03] on mordechai alone he doesn't want to
[56:05] kill mordechai alone
[56:07] for they have showed him the people of
[56:10] mordecai
[56:11] wherefore heaven sought to destroy
[56:14] all the jews this is now
[56:18] this is your background everybody there
[56:21] that were throughout the whole
[56:22] kingdom of hazaras even the people of
[56:26] who
[56:27] we already explained to you the people
[56:29] of mordecai verse 9
[56:31] if he please the king let it be written
[56:35] that they may be destroyed and i will
[56:38] pay
[56:38] ten thousand of talent of silver
[56:42] to the hand of those that have charge of
[56:44] the business
[56:45] to bring it into the king treasury
[56:48] everything here
[56:49] happened in secret this conversation of
[56:53] money
[56:54] happened in the secret between the king
[56:57] and between emman mordecai was not there
[57:02] are you following me so the background
[57:05] or
[57:05] the first verbal message was a message
[57:09] that gives you the true story behind
[57:12] the letter everybody clear
[57:16] praise the name of the lord job to verse
[57:19] 13
[57:20] let's look at the written copy
[57:23] everybody there and the what
[57:26] the letter now the copy of the letter
[57:29] the letter was sent by post
[57:31] into what everybody
[57:34] all the king's provinces to do what
[57:38] to destroy to kill we already seen this
[57:41] last sunday
[57:42] and to cause to perish all the jews both
[57:45] young
[57:46] and old little children and women
[57:49] in one day even upon the 13th day of the
[57:53] 12th month which is the month
[57:55] header and to take the spoil of them
[57:57] forever
[57:58] pray that's all that the letter is
[58:01] saying
[58:01] here the letter does not tell you that
[58:05] there was a conflict between mordechai
[58:07] and heaven
[58:08] the letter doesn't not tell you that
[58:10] there was money
[58:11] that was given behind the back ever here
[58:15] but for you to know that background
[58:18] you need to get in contact with the
[58:21] prophet
[58:23] everybody here you need not only the
[58:26] written message but you need
[58:29] the spoken message
[58:32] [Applause]
[58:34] is everybody following me amen because
[58:37] that leader was sealed with the kingship
[58:42] do you need somebody who can decode
[58:45] the kingship amen because we have the
[58:49] bible
[58:50] that was also sealed with the king's
[58:52] hill
[58:54] and people were preaching with a seal
[58:57] book
[58:58] amen they were giving people what was
[59:01] written
[59:02] in the message in the bible are you
[59:04] there
[59:05] but they lack the revelation of what was
[59:09] in the back part man of god
[59:12] hallelujah they can tell you about
[59:15] abraham
[59:16] they can tell you about jacob they can
[59:19] tell you about isaac
[59:20] but when a prophet comes he goes before
[59:24] the beginning
[59:26] he goes back in the mind of god he gets
[59:29] in the mind of god
[59:31] he watches the man of god then the
[59:33] prophet come
[59:35] and give you the spoken word the spoken
[59:39] message
[59:44] are you following me the verbal message
[59:48] and the written message i won
[59:53] are you following me you can never
[59:56] separate
[59:58] i'm gonna say it again you can never
[1:00:01] separate the verbal or the spoken
[1:00:05] message
[1:00:06] with the written message
[1:00:10] are you there they are both one
[1:00:13] one is just hidden and another one
[1:00:17] is handed to everybody are you there
[1:00:20] so the spoken word is actually the
[1:00:24] original seed
[1:00:26] are you there are you following me the
[1:00:29] spoken word
[1:00:31] developer message that was given by
[1:00:35] monika
[1:00:36] is the original story
[1:00:43] are you following me if you want to know
[1:00:45] the original story
[1:00:47] you need the spoken word
[1:00:50] are you there and it's written between
[1:00:53] the line
[1:00:55] but what you're gonna be doing with the
[1:00:58] copy you just gonna kill people
[1:01:00] because the message of the copy killeth
[1:01:07] the copy condemns you the copy condemns
[1:01:11] your children
[1:01:12] the copy condemns your wife their coffee
[1:01:15] condemn your business
[1:01:17] their copy condemn everything that you
[1:01:19] have
[1:01:20] but to go around that copy you need the
[1:01:24] spoken
[1:01:25] word message
[1:01:30] hallelujah this one is unwritten
[1:01:34] the first the second one is written are
[1:01:37] you there
[1:01:38] so your bible was healed
[1:01:41] and this is the reason why we are in
[1:01:44] trouble
[1:01:45] with not more than 900
[1:01:48] different denominations because the
[1:01:50] bible was healed
[1:01:52] and it takes a prophet to give you the
[1:01:55] background of the bible
[1:01:58] are you there you can never separate the
[1:02:01] message from the bible
[1:02:04] the message and the bible are one
[1:02:07] the message is actually the story
[1:02:10] of the background that was hidden in the
[1:02:14] bible
[1:02:16] [Applause]
[1:02:17] amen so when they give you the story
[1:02:21] of mordecai when you get the copy
[1:02:25] you're not going to be preaching like
[1:02:26] everybody
[1:02:28] are you there when everybody's saying
[1:02:31] they're going to kill your children
[1:02:33] when you come there you say nobody will
[1:02:36] kill your children
[1:02:37] because you are a queen you are
[1:02:41] in contact with the king
[1:02:44] are you there your way of preaching will
[1:02:48] be different
[1:02:49] and that preaching you must be in
[1:02:52] contact
[1:02:52] with mordecai when you get the
[1:02:55] background of mordecai
[1:02:57] the way you preaching that is different
[1:03:00] if they ask you you say no there is
[1:03:02] nothing about the death
[1:03:04] it is just a plot there is a man by the
[1:03:07] name of mordecai
[1:03:09] are you there and there is a man by the
[1:03:11] name of haman
[1:03:12] who is the prime minister brother where
[1:03:15] is that written at him
[1:03:17] [Applause]
[1:03:24] are you following me was the story
[1:03:28] of modern car lie was that story written
[1:03:32] in the copy
[1:03:35] [Music]
[1:03:37] are you there you don't take the written
[1:03:41] word
[1:03:42] to challenge the spoken word
[1:03:46] [Applause]
[1:03:47] are you following me you take the spoken
[1:03:51] word
[1:03:52] and the spoken word will make you
[1:03:54] understand
[1:03:55] the written word
[1:03:59] are you there when mordecai
[1:04:03] comes and he say you know what i see
[1:04:06] herman
[1:04:07] he was giving ten thousand talent of
[1:04:10] money
[1:04:13] and somebody come to you he said where
[1:04:16] is that it
[1:04:17] show me ten thousand here show me ten
[1:04:20] thousand on here
[1:04:21] there's no ten thousand your message is
[1:04:24] false
[1:04:26] are you there if you are rejecting
[1:04:30] the spoken word you are rejecting your
[1:04:33] mercy
[1:04:34] [Applause]
[1:04:38] are you following me because the mercy
[1:04:41] of the jews
[1:04:42] came by the message of mordechai
[1:04:46] you need to get instruction for mordecai
[1:04:50] in order to overcome heaven
[1:04:53] if you don't get destruction from all
[1:04:55] the cow you're gonna get killed
[1:04:58] [Applause]
[1:05:00] amen if maldika says that i was going
[1:05:04] out
[1:05:05] and everybody was bowing down and nobody
[1:05:08] want to bow
[1:05:09] i mean nobody would have stood i was
[1:05:11] alone are you going to believe mordechai
[1:05:13] show me the proof show me the proof
[1:05:19] amen everything is written
[1:05:22] in the book amen and if you notice
[1:05:25] the king himself never gave
[1:05:29] any detail to the queen
[1:05:34] are you there the king never called
[1:05:36] esther
[1:05:37] to tell esther esther you know what
[1:05:40] something is going on
[1:05:41] yeah my prime minister came today and he
[1:05:44] explained me about a certain people in
[1:05:46] the country
[1:05:47] no the king hushed
[1:05:51] the king closed his mouth
[1:05:55] if you go to the king his silence
[1:05:58] but to break the silence of the king
[1:06:01] to break the silence of the seven seal
[1:06:04] you need the prophet
[1:06:08] are you there because the lord will do
[1:06:12] except he reveal his secret to
[1:06:16] mordechai
[1:06:19] are you there if you notice the king
[1:06:22] never disclosed the secret
[1:06:24] but the king has another in that order
[1:06:26] he have to go liver the prophet
[1:06:28] now you have the spirit the bride and
[1:06:31] the
[1:06:32] prophet brother branham in the days of
[1:06:35] the seventh messenger
[1:06:38] in the days of the lord this energy
[1:06:41] its messenger will reveal the mysteries
[1:06:45] of god
[1:06:46] as revealed to paul he will what
[1:06:50] spoken word amen
[1:06:54] and those who receive that prophet

[1:13:12] we need to preach christ we need to
[1:13:14] preach christ
[1:13:16] paul said that he preached christ in a
[1:13:19] mystery
[1:13:20] [Music]
[1:13:25] we need to preach the copy we need to
[1:13:27] preach the copy
[1:13:28] you preach the copy in the mystery
[1:13:34] you preach the copy with the background
[1:13:38] of
[1:13:38] mordecai
[1:13:40] [Music]
[1:13:44] a mystery brother branham
[1:13:49] by the mystery require what
[1:13:54] o never becomes
[1:14:02] amen the lord does nothing
[1:14:06] except by death mordecai
[1:14:09] are you there but that mystery requires
[1:14:13] heart attack or it will never become
[1:14:19] everybody clear let's go back now
[1:14:23] but we speak the wisdom of god christ
[1:14:26] in a mystery we need the spirit
[1:14:30] even the what you remember
[1:14:34] not the written one the hidden one
[1:14:39] you see the mystery the hidden wisdom
[1:14:42] which was which god ordained
[1:14:45] before the world 2 hour so that was
[1:14:49] before
[1:14:50] even yo
[1:14:54] before they wrote the letter by heaven
[1:14:58] there was already a mystery
[1:15:01] [Music]
[1:15:02] but when they put the letter they
[1:15:04] omitted
[1:15:05] those mysteries you need the seventh
[1:15:09] chamberlain
[1:15:10] to bring you the seven unknown thunders
[1:15:17] let's go down which
[1:15:21] none of the places of this world
[1:15:24] no that's why jesus said the world will
[1:15:27] see me no more
[1:15:29] which none of the princes of this world
[1:15:31] knew
[1:15:33] forehead they know it everybody
[1:15:36] following me
[1:15:37] if they have a glass of this mystery
[1:15:41] if they understood the mystery if they
[1:15:45] knew the mystery come on
[1:15:48] they will not have crucified the
[1:15:52] lord of glory but to know the mystery
[1:15:56] you need the spirit
[1:16:00] so when someone crucify the word
[1:16:05] when someone rejects the word
[1:16:08] when someone crucify christ which is the
[1:16:12] message
[1:16:13] amen the consequence the cause of
[1:16:17] it is they never knew or
[1:16:20] understand their mystery
[1:16:25] and a lack of understanding the mystery
[1:16:29] is a lack of the holy ghost
[1:16:36] the holy ghost can get onto your flesh
[1:16:39] he can get into your spirit make you do
[1:16:42] stuff
[1:16:43] but you're going to miss the revelation
[1:16:46] judah did it
[1:16:48] amen but he missed pentecost
[1:16:52] let's go verse 9 but as it is written
[1:16:56] eyes have nothing if you look at the
[1:16:59] copy
[1:17:01] you don't see it this is the copy where
[1:17:04] is the ten thousand
[1:17:06] brother branham said that but where is
[1:17:08] that in the bible
[1:17:09] eyes have nothing
[1:17:15] are you okay this foundation is crushed
[1:17:20] amen no here have what
[1:17:25] so when they give you the story you say
[1:17:27] where did you get that
[1:17:30] because your ear never heard your ear
[1:17:33] only heard the message of heaven
[1:17:37] not the background eyes have not
[1:17:41] seen written no he
[1:17:44] taps

[1:17:56] as have not seen not here
[1:18:03] it is in your bible anybody there
[1:18:07] neither have what into the
[1:18:11] you see where it goes not in the head
[1:18:14] everybody understand when you read it
[1:18:18] or when you listen to the tape it gets
[1:18:21] get to get into there
[1:18:24] you understand now
[1:18:27] neither enter into the heart of man the
[1:18:30] what
[1:18:31] things which god had prepared
[1:18:35] for them that for esther
[1:18:40] are you there there is a love between
[1:18:42] the king and nest
[1:18:44] but god has revealed them to who
[1:18:49] by his by attack
[1:18:53] everybody following me are we clear by
[1:18:56] his spirit for their search of
[1:19:01] everybody clear attack knows how to get
[1:19:04] the entire story amen when you send him
[1:19:08] when he comes he gives you the copy he
[1:19:11] gives you the background
[1:19:12] he gives you everything and he pull
[1:19:14] everything to you
[1:19:17] are you there for the spirit searching
[1:19:19] for
[1:19:20] all things yeah the what
[1:19:25] you want to know the deep friends of god
[1:19:27] you need god
[1:19:29] and that spirit must be connected to her
[1:19:35] hallelujah verse 11 for what
[1:19:39] man knows the spirit of a man
[1:19:42] save the spirit of a man which is inna
[1:19:46] how can you know the thought of brother
[1:19:48] kalima
[1:19:51] except the spirit which is in brother
[1:19:53] kalima so for you to know the thought of
[1:19:55] barack obama
[1:19:56] brother karim i have to give you his
[1:19:58] spirit
[1:20:00] are you there even so the things of god
[1:20:04] know us but god have a way to know his
[1:20:09] secret
[1:20:12] the prophet of old when moved by there
[1:20:17] you understand clear now
[1:20:20] that's why rejecting a prophet is deadly
[1:20:25] even the things of god knows no man
[1:20:28] by the spirit of god now we have
[1:20:31] received
[1:20:32] not the spirit of the world because
[1:20:34] we're going to crucify the messiah
[1:20:36] but the spirit which is of god that we
[1:20:39] met
[1:20:42] the things that are given unto
[1:20:46] that's the reason why the king appointed
[1:20:49] attack
[1:20:53] the king appointed attack to esther
[1:20:57] so esther can know the things
[1:21:00] that the king have given freely to
[1:21:04] esther
[1:21:07] are you there as long as you don't
[1:21:09] engage
[1:21:10] as long as you don't depend as long as

[1:21:16] you will not get access to the things
[1:21:19] that are
[1:21:20] freely given to you by god
[1:21:24] that's why you must be born again you
[1:21:27] must have the holy ghost
[1:21:28] [Music]

[1:21:33] message you're going to be sending

[1:36:00] the reason why they are afraid because
[1:36:03] they are not
[1:36:03] taught right and settle right on there
[1:36:07] that's why you are sure the man
[1:36:10] that you talk to is not a higher man
[1:36:14] like that he's not
[1:36:17] the heir he's a person
[1:36:20] he has feelings and he can be touched by
[1:36:24] your feelings when you hurt he hurt him

[1:46:59] think not you with yourself
[1:47:02] that you shall escape in the king's
[1:47:04] house
[1:47:05] more than all the jews for if you all
[1:47:08] together
[1:47:09] hold your peace you skip with the
[1:47:11] attitude you are
[1:47:13] still waiting waiting waiting
[1:47:16] amen then shout their enlargement
[1:47:20] and deliverance arrives to the jews from
[1:47:22] another place
[1:47:24] but you and your
[1:47:27] i thought her father was dead
[1:47:30] i thought her mother was dead there were
[1:47:33] only two
[1:47:34] human mordechai in other words me and
[1:47:37] you
[1:47:37] are gonna be dead i'm not going down
[1:47:40] myself
[1:47:41] i just want to tell you if i go down you
[1:47:43] go down
[1:47:46] are you there but i cannot act
[1:47:50] this is the this is not revelation 10 1
[1:47:53] to 7
[1:47:54] 10 1 2 2 2 7 that's my ministry
[1:47:57] now this is revelation 10 8 2
[1:48:00] 11. that is not me anymore i cannot
[1:48:04] touch that part that part belongs to you
[1:48:07] but if you don't do that part i'm not
[1:48:10] gonna get resurrected
[1:48:14] my tomb is in jeffersonville you must
[1:48:17] get back
[1:48:18] to your position
[1:48:21] hallelujah shall be destroyed
[1:48:24] and who knows
[1:48:28] whether only her attack can give you
[1:48:30] this
[1:48:31] who knows whether you are come to the
[1:48:34] kingdom
[1:48:36] for such a time as in other words you
[1:48:39] don't know let me explain to you the
[1:48:41] reason why you were chosen
[1:48:43] and placed in that position is not for
[1:48:46] you to play games
[1:48:48] it was because there was something
[1:48:50] coming up and it will require
[1:48:52] you to do something
[1:48:56] are you there then
[1:49:00] now the revelation comes they dealt with
[1:49:02] the fear
[1:49:03] that's why brother brother i'm preaching
[1:49:04] not free no you're not afraid you're not
[1:49:06] afraid you're not afraid
[1:49:07] are you there and then esther
[1:49:10] beat them return give them the answer
[1:49:13] mordecai decency
[1:49:14] go gather together all the jews that are
[1:49:17] present in susha
[1:49:20] i'm still good at choosing amen
[1:49:24] and do what fast you for me
[1:49:28] and neither eat no drink
[1:49:31] how many days night oh
[1:49:35] whatever you saw why you say that
[1:49:40] you say why you say that amen
[1:49:44] do not eat fast for how many days
[1:49:47] three days
[1:49:51] night time
[1:49:54] if you look at this language
[1:49:58] it is a language that was spoken by
[1:50:01] jonah
[1:50:04] are you okay check yourself now amen
[1:50:08] jonah enter into the belly of the well
[1:50:12] how many days and what
[1:50:15] and the miracle of jonah spoke up the
[1:50:18] resurrection
[1:50:22] are you there that's why in john in
[1:50:25] matthew
[1:50:26] chapter 12 verse 40 they say what
[1:50:29] they say as jonah was what three days
[1:50:33] and three nights in there
[1:50:36] so the son of man must be what three
[1:50:39] days
[1:50:39] and three now but if you notice jesus
[1:50:42] never was three days and three nights
[1:50:46] [Music]
[1:50:49] you ready esther have to fight for how
[1:50:52] many days
[1:50:54] and three nights and then do what go to
[1:50:57] the king
[1:50:58] in other words day one fasting
[1:51:02] day two fasting day three
[1:51:06] fasting day four going to the king
[1:51:10] right one two
[1:51:14] three then go to the king
[1:51:18] you ready wake up
[1:51:22] take chapter five
[1:51:25] this is your answer take chapter five
[1:51:28] are you there
[1:51:29] let's see first one now he came to pass
[1:51:33] on
[1:51:34] there stop ready
[1:51:40] how do you see this stuff brother
[1:51:41] stephen
[1:51:45] are you there
[1:51:49] you need a prophet are you there
[1:51:53] according to the copy
[1:51:58] you must wait day one day two
[1:52:02] day three and day four you go to the
[1:52:05] king
[1:52:06] that's the copy
[1:52:10] are you there and the people begin to
[1:52:13] believe
[1:52:14] because jesus died on friday
[1:52:17] friday saturday sunday he rose again
[1:52:21] which is not three days because he wrote
[1:52:22] sunday earlier
[1:52:26] and the people that rejected the message
[1:52:30] and begin to play with the copy to
[1:52:33] justify
[1:52:35] for three days they say you know what
[1:52:37] jesus died on thursday
[1:52:41] i'm not gonna call name where did you
[1:52:44] get it
[1:52:46] because you want to justify the copy
[1:52:50] if you come to the prophet the prophet
[1:52:52] will help you up
[1:52:55] based on what we read on verse 16
[1:52:58] he says three days then i will go to the
[1:53:01] king
[1:53:01] it says one two three four to the king
[1:53:05] but on verse chapter five verse one we
[1:53:08] found out that she fasted
[1:53:10] she fasted here she broke the fast
[1:53:15] [Music]
[1:53:18] she went to see the king not on the
[1:53:21] fourth day
[1:53:23] as you can read with your intellectual.
[1:53:27] she goes to the king under
[1:53:31] [Music]
[1:53:35] jonah three days jesus three days
[1:53:38] that's what matthew 12 40 say we got to
[1:53:41] justify it
[1:53:45] brother branham questioned an answer in
[1:53:47] matthew 12
[1:53:48] 40 it says as
[1:53:51] jonah was three days and three nights
[1:53:54] in the west bayley so shall the son of
[1:53:57] man be three days and three nights
[1:53:59] in the heart of the earth how can it be
[1:54:01] that day
[1:54:02] so i say today that they say he was put
[1:54:06] in the tomb
[1:54:07] on friday i don't know where they get
[1:54:08] thursday former
[1:54:11] rejecting the message on friday evening
[1:54:14] and rose on sunday morning
[1:54:20] friday saturday
[1:54:23] sunday not today morning evening
[1:54:28] then the whole day then earlier
[1:54:31] so it's like you put this almost two
[1:54:33] days
[1:54:35] one day half half
[1:54:40] are you there okay
[1:54:43] he was put on the tomb on friday evening
[1:54:46] and wrote sunday morning
[1:54:47] making it what two days and one day
[1:54:51] what i mean now if you notice he say
[1:54:54] us
[1:55:00] you need a prophet because god revealed
[1:55:04] nothing but by the way
[1:55:08] you see in the days when jonah was in
[1:55:11] the
[1:55:11] in the belly three days and three nights
[1:55:14] it's
[1:55:14] within i want to see the scripture
[1:55:19] i want to see the scripture
[1:55:23] brother stephen that that's brother
[1:55:25] brother
[1:55:26] let me see the scripture
[1:55:30] within three days and three nights
[1:55:33] within that three days and three nights
[1:55:36] because you can make the scripture lie
[1:55:39] the prophet said
[1:55:40] i will not suffer my only one to see
[1:55:43] what
[1:55:45] neither will i leave his soul in hell
[1:55:47] and corruption
[1:55:48] set in human body in what
[1:55:52] which is three days and three nine
[1:55:54] sometime
[1:55:55] within that three days and three nights
[1:55:58] that he must come forward from there
[1:56:01] so being three days and three nights
[1:56:05] though he has to be
[1:56:10] when esther said three days and three
[1:56:13] nights it doesn't mean
[1:56:15] exactly like that
[1:56:20] [Applause]
[1:56:22] you need a prophet
[1:56:28] it is sometime within that three days
[1:56:31] and three nights
[1:56:32] he had to come forth because the
[1:56:34] prophecy cannot be broken
[1:56:36] he could not see corruption and he would
[1:56:38] have corrupted
[1:56:39] if he stays exactly that time
[1:56:43] that's brother's brother explanation

[1:58:27] even the jews understood but when you
[1:58:30] reject the message you
[1:58:32] lose even that but he speak of the
[1:58:36] temple of what
[1:58:38] oh so the temple means his body

[1:58:48] when therefore he was risen from the
[1:58:50] dead
[1:58:51] his disciple remember that he said
[1:58:54] this unto them and they believe the
[1:58:57] written part and are written apart

[1:59:16] arose certain and bear what
[1:59:21] ah brother stephen this is a false
[1:59:23] witness so you're gonna use the
[1:59:25] scripture of a false witness
[1:59:27] this is let me keep it it's a false
[1:59:29] witness
[1:59:30] so what he says is false
[1:59:33] against him saying we have heard him say
[1:59:38] i won't destroy this temple that is made
[1:59:41] with him
[1:59:42] and what the false witness is saying
[1:59:46] with him
[1:59:47] but stephen you cannot use this
[1:59:48] scripture because this is a false
[1:59:50] witness
[1:59:52] three days i will build another one made
[1:59:55] without hand
[1:59:56] it is true my friend you who gonna
[1:59:59] listen to me after all who sneak in at
[2:00:01] this time
[2:00:02] it is true it's a false witness but let
[2:00:05] me help you up
[2:00:07] and so deceiving is the wrong thing
[2:00:11] now a lie if it's just right out
[2:00:15] in real life then anyone can detect it
[2:00:18] but that lie that has got about
[2:00:20] 99 truth in it that is the one that is
[2:00:25] so it should i have how many percentages
[2:00:30] relax i'm still going with the injection
[2:00:35] oh errol has what
[2:00:39] the biggest lie was ever told head nandy
[2:00:43] we already know
[2:00:44] percent truth in it they like that set
[2:00:47] and talk to who
[2:00:48] so this this man is lying if he's lying
[2:00:53] there is a part of a truth in what is
[2:00:55] lying
[2:00:57] now remind me what john 2 says
[2:01:02] destroy what that's what john said
[2:01:06] that was the word of jesus christ let's
[2:01:08] see his lie
[2:01:09] and let's see the part of the truth if
[2:01:12] you notice there is a blue color
[2:01:17] over there let's see we heard him say
[2:01:22] jesus i will stop did jesus say i will
[2:01:27] he never say jesus said destroy
[2:01:31] this temple that's the blue that's the
[2:01:33] truth
[2:01:34] we are pulling the true father life are
[2:01:37] you following me
[2:01:39] are you following me is everybody saying
[2:01:41] that
[2:01:42] so i will is a lie jesus didn't say i
[2:01:46] will destroy
[2:01:47] jesus said destroy this temple this is
[2:01:50] truth
[2:01:51] this is lie everybody clear
[2:01:54] let's move on that is made with hand did
[2:01:57] jesus say that
[2:01:59] that's a lie are we clear
[2:02:02] and jesus said that yes in
[2:02:05] three days with him
[2:02:09] you see that within three days that is
[2:02:12] the truth
[2:02:14] i will build another
[2:02:19] the temple jesus was speaking was what
[2:02:22] brother branham say resurrection
[2:02:25] is not replacement replacement means
[2:02:30] another temple but resurrection is the
[2:02:33] same temple that went

[2:05:04] so the church started on the day of
[2:05:06] pentecost
[2:05:07] and the holy ghost got into it and
[2:05:10] babylon came
[2:05:12] and destroyed the church and put the
[2:05:14] church into the dark ages
[2:05:17] but god said i will restore
[2:05:20] but to restore the church in what
[2:05:25] it's three days there is a separation
[2:05:28] between me and the king

[2:05:56] restored in what
[2:05:58] in within in not after
[2:06:02] you see in three stages rather
[2:06:05] three stages it shall be restored what
[2:06:13] one two everybody clear
[2:06:17] there was a lot of time where there is
[2:06:19] no more communication with the king
[2:06:22] are you there but it take what 30 days
[2:06:28] it takes what three steps
[2:06:32] to eternity
[2:06:36] three steps to
[2:06:40] everybody clear let me jump now in
[2:06:43] revelation chapter 14.
[2:06:47] are you still okay or we can stop you
[2:06:50] we're good
[2:06:52] there is three angels the first one
[2:06:55] have an everlasting gospel the second
[2:06:59] one
[2:06:59] spoke about fornication on cleanness the
[2:07:02] third one right here
[2:07:03] spoke about the mark of the beast who
[2:07:06] are those angels
[2:07:09] i'd like you to write down revelation 14
[2:07:12] 6-12 that is the word three last angel
[2:07:16] three angel after the seven last day
[2:07:20] angel there where what three
[2:07:23] special angel comforts
[2:07:26] did you notice that and now i want you
[2:07:29] to notice them three last danger
[2:07:31] the first that is revelation 14 6-12
[2:07:35] the first danger has sanded the trumpet
[2:07:37] of the gospel
[2:07:39] and had the everlasting gospel to preach
[2:07:42] to the world
[2:07:43] the second kind of preach a holiness
[2:07:46] gospel
[2:07:47] i'm going by the prophet see because he
[2:07:50] said that the church has committed what
[2:07:53] everybody clear now and the third angel
[2:07:57] roar out revelation 10 to escape the
[2:08:00] mark of what
[2:08:02] watch the first angel at the reformation
[2:08:05] what is his name esther
[2:08:09] begin to get back to the kingdom
[2:08:12] the first day anybody okay
[2:08:16] preach the gospel second nature who
[2:08:20] the second day sanctification
[2:08:24] the fornication he straightened up the
[2:08:26] church of it
[2:08:27] but the third message that's why
[2:08:29] yesterday went into the third day
[2:08:32] you follow me but the third message the
[2:08:35] pentecostal message
[2:08:37] should be the true messenger
[2:08:40] warning them to escape the mark of the
[2:08:42] beast saying
[2:08:43] whoever received the mark of the beast
[2:08:46] the same will drink of the wrath
[2:08:48] of god pour it out with that mixture
[2:08:50] into the cup offending nation
[2:08:52] be poured out to the people upon the
[2:08:54] people
[2:08:56] that is the very message what
[2:09:00] the third the third
[2:09:03] the last the lutheran message of what
[2:09:08] the wesley message of water and the
[2:09:10] pentecostal message of what
[2:09:16] everybody clear after this last night
[2:09:20] it is in your hand he that will
[2:09:23] disbelieve it willfully
[2:09:25] after he has received the knowledge of
[2:09:27] the truth
[2:09:28] seen the angel of the lord coming
[2:09:30] proving everything at the last day
[2:09:32] seeing the everlasting gospel preach to
[2:09:34] be
[2:09:35] be preached by who seeing sanctification
[2:09:38] to be preached by who
[2:09:40] and now the gospel in here warning you
[2:09:43] against what
[2:09:45] the this is the third angel message
[2:09:48] to the world the third angel message is
[2:09:51] going forth one
[2:09:53] in this this is the flying
[2:09:57] a flying of there
[2:10:01] so based on the decode of the message
[2:10:05] these are your three angels
[2:10:08] are you there there is three special
[2:10:12] angels they are special because
[2:10:15] their step is the step god used
[2:10:19] to actually redeem an individual
[2:10:22] you must be justified sanctified
[2:10:26] then fill with the holy ghost
[2:10:29] water blood life that's why they are
[2:10:33] special everybody clear
[2:10:37] the three step of grace justification
[2:10:40] sanctification
[2:10:41] baptism of the holy spirit on the day of
[2:10:44] pentecost
[2:10:46] the lord came into his temple that
[2:10:48] temple
[2:10:49] was destroyed by babylon but in three
[2:10:52] days
[2:10:53] in three dispensations justification
[2:10:56] sanctification baptism of the holy ghost
[2:10:59] then you get in the presence of the
[2:11:01] kingdom
[2:11:01] [Music]
[2:11:04] and when you get in the presence of the
[2:11:06] king you open the banquet
[2:11:10] are you following me the problem is
[2:11:14] the last dispensation is a trouble
[2:11:18] everybody there what is going on
[2:11:21] take out the chapter now yeah probably i
[2:11:25] don't know if i'm gonna
[2:11:26] cross this everybody clear
[2:11:29] let's go to actually chapter nine keep
[2:11:31] esther chapter five
[2:11:34] don't worry uh with time
[2:11:39] act chapter 9
[2:11:43] if you dare you can say amen
[2:11:56] you there verse three
[2:12:00] and as he journey this is speaking about
[2:12:03] paul
[2:12:03] when he met the pillar of fire as he
[2:12:07] journeyed
[2:12:08] he came near damascus and suddenly there
[2:12:11] shined round about him a light from
[2:12:12] heaven we know that
[2:12:14] and he fell to the earth and heard a
[2:12:16] voice saying to him
[2:12:18] so so why persecute that me
[2:12:22] so saul was completely under a different
[2:12:24] anointing
[2:12:25] persecuting the church the message of
[2:12:28] the hour
[2:12:29] and he said who are you lord
[2:12:33] and the lord said i am jesus yes
[2:12:37] whom you persecute it is hard for you to
[2:12:40] kick against the pricks
[2:12:42] and he trembling and astonished say lord
[2:12:44] what will you have me to do
[2:12:46] there is a calling of paul here
[2:12:49] the first thing they're calling and we
[2:12:52] already understood that
[2:12:54] when the lord pick a vessel
[2:12:58] are you there and pick it up it is
[2:13:00] called what
[2:13:03] i'm happy with this church

[2:13:15] and it shall be told you what you must
[2:13:17] do
[2:13:18] verse 8 and saul arose from the earth
[2:13:21] and when his eyes were opened he saw no
[2:13:24] man
[2:13:26] but they led him by the hand and brought
[2:13:29] him
[2:13:30] into damascus so after the encounter
[2:13:33] with the pillar of fire
[2:13:35] souls become blind something happened to
[2:13:37] his eyes
[2:13:39] the blindness of soul was the blindness
[2:13:42] of the heart that's why
[2:13:46] he was persecuting the church i'm going
[2:13:49] to correct you something here
[2:13:51] are you there everybody clear but
[2:13:54] when he got in contact with the pillar
[2:13:57] of fire

[2:29:19] because only that one will you be
[2:29:21] accepted
[2:29:23] are you there what is the message there
[2:29:26] and we stop here
[2:29:28] quite a reading when i was first
[2:29:31] converted
[2:29:32] i was ordained in the baptist church
[2:29:35] i had a good old teacher by the name of
[2:29:38] who
[2:29:40] dr roe davis he was a what
[2:29:44] why did brother branham god allow him to
[2:29:47] be put under a lawyer
[2:29:50] he should be under a priest
[2:29:54] he should be born under a mighty
[2:29:56] preacher
[2:29:57] maybe he should be in the church of
[2:29:59] billy graham
[2:30:02] but god put him under a lawyer
[2:30:06] your life is not a hazard
[2:30:09] they step you going in your life god
[2:30:12] knows exactly
[2:30:13] what you need to put you where he wants
[2:30:16] you to be
[2:30:18] are you there he was a lawyer before his
[2:30:21] conversion
[2:30:22] and he took everything from a legal
[2:30:25] legal
[2:30:26] standpoint in the bible her deficit is
[2:30:28] like
[2:30:30] yes
[2:30:34] and god took brother branham and put him
[2:30:37] under someone who's like
[2:30:40] back to the bible back to the bible
[2:30:43] but i want to move back to the bible roy
[2:30:46] davis i say back to the bible
[2:30:50] are you there i remember my first sermon
[2:30:54] i preached
[2:30:55] they give brother bran of the pulpit
[2:30:57] first minister
[2:30:59] when i'm getting on the pulpit i preach
[2:31:01] on something
[2:31:03] and grinding for the enemy
[2:31:06] when i went over and had my own hand
[2:31:10] tied to the post
[2:31:12] but rather begin to preach he had
[2:31:14] somebody tied in his head
[2:31:15] and brother by them is preaching some
[2:31:17] son tied like this
[2:31:19] roy davis is sitting he's just doing
[2:31:22] this
[2:31:25] amen and oh i went through what
[2:31:29] every emotion that i guess
[2:31:32] that i thought the preacher could go
[2:31:34] through
[2:31:36] but the problem is going then some
[2:31:40] oh my god it hurt all day this is just
[2:31:42] room
[2:31:46] and when i notice old dr davis sitting
[2:31:49] there
[2:31:50] with his finger up to his mouth just
[2:31:53] watching me
[2:31:55] we're talking about esther being dressed
[2:31:58] with the garment of praise
[2:32:00] and with the word
[2:32:05] and after the service was over i had
[2:32:08] made my altar call
[2:32:10] but when i'm finished come
[2:32:14] those who need jesus a lord of
[2:32:18] old brothers
[2:32:23] so he played with the emotions on the
[2:32:26] pulpit
[2:32:28] and he caught the women
[2:32:34] imagine something then the mother oh
[2:32:37] poor
[2:32:39] oh dear oh it's so touchy
[2:32:45] come to the altar the mothers

[2:32:52] walking up
[2:32:53] padding me on the shoulder oh they say

[2:33:08] that was just about he get there
[2:33:11] dr david look at him that was just about
[2:33:15] as ridiculous

[2:33:23] by the bottom was coming every sister
[2:33:25] said was wonderful whatever i'm saying

[2:33:30] stamp like this is my boy
[2:33:32] when he get there they say ridiculous
[2:33:38] oh he will took the cell off of me so i
[2:33:42] said well
[2:33:43] what's the matter dr davis you want to
[2:33:46] continue
[2:33:49] he said one time i was a practicing law
[2:33:53] me davison i went and i heard
[2:33:57] few cases tried so he went to the court
[2:34:01] and dr davis was sitting watching her
[2:34:03] other lawyers
[2:34:04] are getting their case done i said
[2:34:08] when i heard the case i watched her
[2:34:12] instead of roy davis watching
[2:34:16] what how the case has been presented
[2:34:20] dr roy davis was took by the
[2:34:23] emotion of the lawyer how they move how
[2:34:26] they do this
[2:34:27] and do this
[2:34:31] i watched the emotion of the attorneys
[2:34:34] the attorneys went through i said when i
[2:34:38] tried my first case
[2:34:39] after i was sewn to the bench he said i
[2:34:42] took off my coat
[2:34:43] dr davis first case just like brother
[2:34:46] brother
[2:34:46] took off his coat he remembered the
[2:34:48] emotions
[2:34:50] and the judge is sitting watching him
[2:34:52] and it was a lady i was defending
[2:34:55] another lady and say i pondered on the
[2:34:59] desk
[2:35:00] you need to all hear this
[2:35:04] they are just watching him i cried
[2:35:07] hello this lady
[2:35:10] i walked back and forth and i said i
[2:35:14] thought i had the case whipped
[2:35:17] that is all there was to it
[2:35:20] and said the old judge sat there
[2:35:24] after a while he wrapped the bench and
[2:35:26] said
[2:35:27] george your honor in other words hey hey
[2:35:31] stop stop how much more
[2:35:34] of these ridiculous things can you code
[2:35:36] can they coach them
[2:35:39] oh i thought i got everybody stared up
[2:35:41] the judge said
[2:35:42] stop that foolishness
[2:35:48] well then i felt that i felt like i was
[2:35:52] just whipped
[2:35:54] i walked out to defeat it i went home
[2:35:56] and said well
[2:35:58] i study something else i never make a
[2:36:00] lawyer
[2:36:02] the first case i'm done said after one
[2:36:06] somebody knock on the door and who was
[2:36:09] it
[2:36:10] the old attorney he came home
[2:36:14] that's why they put brother brother
[2:36:15] under roy davis
[2:36:18] he heard open the door
[2:36:22] yes sir what does he want again
[2:36:26] and he come down he said well
[2:36:29] i was watching you and he said you know
[2:36:34] discord
[2:36:36] say the reason i did that i want you to
[2:36:40] be a real
[2:36:41] lawyer i know it is in you
[2:36:45] to be a lawyer but this court
[2:36:48] does not make its decision upon your
[2:36:52] mental emotion
[2:36:55] you had a lot of mental emotion
[2:36:59] but you had no law in defense
[2:37:05] are you following me and i think that is
[2:37:08] very good
[2:37:09] this is brother branham i said dr davis
[2:37:13] i thank you he said billy
[2:37:16] all of your emotions and going on and
[2:37:19] tying samsung to the post
[2:37:21] and whipping him and putting his eyes
[2:37:23] out
[2:37:24] you didn't get very much scripture
[2:37:29] men are not served by emotions
[2:37:33] and no delete a sad story you tell
[2:37:39] you read the book bring it to the booth
[2:37:41] read the book bring it to the puppet
[2:37:43] read the book bring it to the puppet you
[2:37:45] leave the message people stay with you
[2:37:49] man says served by the word of god
[2:37:52] that certainly fixed me up
[2:37:56] since then i have decided this that god
[2:37:59] does not judge us upon our emotion
[2:38:03] or upon our affiliation with the church
[2:38:06] he judges by death
[2:38:08] heaven enough shall pass away but man
[2:38:12] shall never pass away now in the day
[2:38:14] that we are living
[2:38:16] and the time that we are living in i
[2:38:18] think it behooves us
[2:38:20] to check up with them and see where we
[2:38:23] are living and the hour we are living in
[2:38:27] this is where i finish i wonder if we
[2:38:30] are sufficiently impressed with what
[2:38:33] let me give you a thought here how do
[2:38:36] you pray
[2:38:37] we pray in jesus name don't we every
[2:38:40] prayer is in the name
[2:38:42] in his name or there is not any answer
[2:38:44] yet in first john 5
[2:38:46] 14 word we are told this is the
[2:38:50] confidence that we have in him
[2:38:52] that if we ask anything according to
[2:38:54] what
[2:38:55] he hears us and if we know that he heals
[2:38:58] us
[2:38:58] whatsoever we ask we know that we have
[2:39:01] the petition that we desire
[2:39:03] now we ask what is the will of god
[2:39:06] there is only one way to know his will
[2:39:09] and that is by
[2:39:10] what lamentation 337
[2:39:13] who is he that's safe and he cometh to
[2:39:16] pass
[2:39:17] when the lord commanded in other words
[2:39:19] if the lord have not commanded it's not
[2:39:21] going to come to pass
[2:39:23] there it is if it's not the word you
[2:39:26] can't have it
[2:39:28] so we can't ask unless it is in there
[2:39:32] and we kept it and we can petition
[2:39:35] or ask until it is in his
[2:39:38] there it is again jesus the name is the
[2:39:41] word
[2:39:42] will you can't separate god in his word
[2:39:45] that's the reason why when esther
[2:39:48] approaches the king
[2:39:49] first she approaches the king with
[2:39:51] praises but
[2:39:52] you don't impress god with emotion
[2:39:55] you impress god by the word
