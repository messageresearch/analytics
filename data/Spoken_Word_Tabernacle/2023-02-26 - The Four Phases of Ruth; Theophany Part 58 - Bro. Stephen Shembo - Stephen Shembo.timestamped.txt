[25:49] praise the Lord
[25:51] amen um we are all witnesses to the
[25:54] testimony amen um I just want to praise
[25:57] God that my wife is doing well she was
[25:59] not able to make it to church this
[26:01] morning because
[26:02] um there's still some some pain um in
[26:05] her back but I believe it was because of
[26:07] um laying down in bed for like five days
[26:10] in the hospital but I believe
[26:13] um on Wednesday coming the Lord will
[26:15] surely been here to church amen amen I
[26:19] just want to um
[26:20] praise God for what he did at the latter
[26:24] stages when she was in the hospital
[26:28] um it was this nurse that um
[26:31] when
[26:32] they took it out for for a procedure and
[26:36] then she came back she asked that we
[26:38] should pray
[26:39] so when we were praying after the prayer
[26:42] I realized something had changed with a
[26:45] nurse that was taking care of her
[26:48] she realized that we were Christians
[26:51] so when she approached and then we were
[26:55] telling her that the pain had come down
[26:57] she was saying hallelujah and um
[27:01] because we prayed she became confident
[27:04] to to say hallelujah because initially
[27:09] she was not really sure whether they
[27:11] support Christians or not but because we
[27:14] prayed it it drew her closer
[27:16] and then um when I when I left the
[27:19] hospital my wife said that
[27:22] she came closer to her
[27:24] she had a plane
[27:25] um State and she was like I'm also a
[27:30] Christian
[27:30] um which
[27:32] um personally listening to and my wife
[27:34] said he was listening to the prophet
[27:36] William Branham she thought it was Billy
[27:38] Graham and my wife said nah it's not
[27:40] Billy Graham but William Branham and she
[27:42] said well she'll go and listen to it
[27:45] she's going to find out um see who it is
[27:48] but then uh
[27:50] as they were talking my wife was sharing
[27:52] her testimony to her
[27:55] and she was like she told me that she
[27:57] the nurse cried the whole time listening
[28:00] to her testimony and she said that she
[28:03] believes that the Lord brought her to
[28:05] the hospital because of her and whatever
[28:08] she was going through my wife was like
[28:11] um
[28:12] that thing I don't know what she was
[28:15] going through as a nurse but I want to
[28:17] thank God that um we going to the
[28:20] hospital was not just in pain but the
[28:22] Lord had to touch somebody and and I
[28:26] believe one of these days the Lord will
[28:27] lead her to church
[28:29] amen
[28:31] amen
[28:33] amen
[28:36] amen uh sorry we couldn't get her name
[28:39] but I believe
[28:40] the Lord shall lead her to church amen
[28:43] amen so
[28:45] um as my wife shared that with me this
[28:48] song just dropped to me and it was just
[28:49] a simple song I just want to sing it
[28:52] amen
[28:55] amen praise the Lord amen
[29:00] so he said it Is Well with My Soul It Is
[29:03] Well with My Body it is what my spirit

[31:17] [Applause]
[31:22] amen let's continue to remember
[31:25] um sister a coach amen and to give our
[31:28] brother strength as well
[31:30] but God is truly with them amen praise
[31:33] the lord we want to remember brother
[31:35] Lamont as well he had to go in this
[31:37] morning to the Urgent Care because of
[31:40] some pretty bad back pain amen so um
[31:44] I want to bring up one more little thing
[31:46] I know it might be redundant did it I
[31:49] sent a video this this week my wife went
[31:52] out
[31:53] and was singing to the cows
[31:56] the little calves they're this big
[31:59] she was singing born born again
[32:02] and when she got to that part they said
[32:03] I'm gonna see my Jesus that little cow
[32:06] started running around and kicking and
[32:08] running around
[32:10] having a little Revival in the pen
[32:14] and the reason I keep bringing this up
[32:18] about these cows
[32:20] is it's just a cow
[32:23] it's only a cow he's a month old
[32:26] the two of them they're only this big
[32:30] it's kind of like the sparrow that the
[32:32] Bible refers to
[32:34] he he's mindful of that little Sparrow
[32:38] he's Mindful and even causes rejoicing
[32:41] in a little calf's heart
[32:44] so when we have problems like
[32:47] coats
[32:48] or brother Lamont
[32:50] nothing for God because we are children
[32:54] of God it's just a cow let's stand amen
[32:59] brother
[33:00] would you like to come up and lead us in
[33:02] prayer this morning you like to do that
[33:04] remember remember our brothers you don't
[33:07] have to remember the cows they're fine
[33:08] now
[33:09] okay they're healed
[33:17] really quick church
[33:19] it's okay God bless you and good morning
[33:23] um

[33:28] say the last since December dealing with
[33:30] our property management company
[33:33] um
[33:33] Wednesday service was for us when when
[33:37] brother God given said God you'll get

[34:34] heard anything about our renewal that's
[34:35] coming up in April everything around us
[34:37] where we want to stay is two to three
[34:39] times the amount

[1:00:45] somewhere
[1:00:47] it will help a minister brother Branham
[1:00:50] says in the message adoption he say Oh
[1:00:52] Sister Scott I believe it is sitting

[1:00:57] today
[1:00:58] a teaching going around somewhere you
[1:01:01] ready my brother in the world around
[1:01:04] different parts of the country I have
[1:01:06] heard of it lots what is the teaching
[1:01:09] that Jesus is here on Earth

[1:01:18] does this that is a lie
[1:01:24] you will meet Jesus way

[1:01:39] in order place it in the promised land
[1:01:42] so they can enter so all the enemy can
[1:01:45] be held drove out going back again to
[1:01:48] The Sisters Meeting let's go with this
[1:01:52] and I believe this
[1:01:54] what do you believe brother

[1:02:10] who has not yet received the water Holy
[1:02:13] Spirit how many people many
[1:02:15] everybody okay
[1:02:17] but I believe down in the heart many of
[1:02:22] them has a what warm feeling toward who
[1:02:25] God and the Desiring the water baptism
[1:02:29] of the Holy Spirit you know the main
[1:02:31] thing is our message it is not the what
[1:02:35] message that is hindering it's the way
[1:02:39] presented sometimes
[1:02:43] how did you preach someone this message
[1:02:48] how did you present this message to
[1:02:51] somebody
[1:02:52] how did you present this message at work
[1:02:58] showing them that they grow
[1:03:01] the denominational they don't know
[1:03:04] anything
[1:03:08] how did you present this message

[1:03:21] the messages
[1:03:23] we cause the people to discuss this
[1:03:26] message by our Behavior
[1:03:29] and the way we presented the message the
[1:03:33] message is pure
[1:03:37] the message is that saved alone
[1:03:41] the message is perfectly in line with
[1:03:45] the Bible
[1:03:46] the message and the Bible are one
[1:03:50] the problem is how did you present the
[1:03:53] message how did you present Malachi for
[1:03:58] how did you introduce brother Branham to
[1:04:00] someone
[1:04:06] you leave the message you start taking

[1:04:18] who told you the message say you should
[1:04:20] have a hair looking like somebody who

[1:15:56] to just tell him to raise his hand look
[1:15:58] around who want to get baptized
[1:16:01] raise your hand brother

[1:16:10] do you see
[1:16:11] do you see there is a lot of work going
[1:16:14] on so you understand what's going on
[1:16:16] everybody good let's go to Romans
[1:16:19] chapter 8.
[1:16:21] what I like about you you get the signal
[1:16:23] quickly
[1:16:25] I can talk to you I can talk to you
[1:16:27] before somebody and they don't
[1:16:28] understand what we're talking
[1:16:32] when you get married you will learn that
[1:16:36] [Laughter]
[1:16:38] Roman 8 verse 10 if you dare you can say
[1:16:42] Amen
[1:16:44] and if
[1:16:46] Christ be in you
[1:16:48] the body is dead is that right because
[1:16:52] of sin but the spirit is life because of
[1:16:55] righteousness
[1:16:57] you might be seated but
[1:17:00] if the spirit is my voice okay
[1:17:05] remember when I get loud I'm not yelling
[1:17:07] at anyone
[1:17:10] it is my makeup
[1:17:15] everybody good
[1:17:17] okay
[1:17:18] I don't want somebody get offended why
[1:17:20] is he loud
[1:17:23] go ask my maker
[1:17:27] but if the spirit
[1:17:29] of him that which this that's where the
[1:17:33] theology got in trouble because they
[1:17:35] take a human being they put him into uh
[1:17:39] to be a Catholic priest and they change
[1:17:41] him completely even his way of talking
[1:17:44] making him a big hypocrite
[1:17:48] when people are laughing he's trying to
[1:17:50] go no laugh
[1:17:54] laugh the way you laugh
[1:17:59] how are you doing no laughs
[1:18:04] what's wrong hey let me free
[1:18:09] too much headache
[1:18:11] it's a family body and if the spirit of
[1:18:15] I know what I'm doing as you're getting
[1:18:17] relaxed the needle is coming
[1:18:21] and if the spirit of him that raise up
[1:18:23] Jesus from the dead
[1:18:26] dwelling you he that raised up Christ
[1:18:29] from the dead shall do what
[1:18:31] also Quicken your mortal Body by his
[1:18:35] spirit that dwell out in you so first of
[1:18:38] all before you can have that quickening
[1:18:41] the spirit of God must be in you first
[1:18:45] if the Holy Ghost is not in you how is
[1:18:47] he going to Quicken your body
[1:18:50] that's why with that the Holy Ghost you
[1:18:52] cannot go in the rapture
[1:18:56] because you must have the decoder yes of
[1:19:00] the Rapture the one that that that
[1:19:01] triggered the Rapture must be in you so
[1:19:04] he can trigger the rapture
[1:19:07] everybody good
[1:19:08] glory to God job to verse 17. and if
[1:19:11] children then Heir heir of God and
[1:19:14] joined hair with Christ if so be that we
[1:19:17] suffer with him that we may also
[1:19:20] glorify together glorify together
[1:19:22] everybody okay for I reckon that the
[1:19:25] suffering of this present time are not
[1:19:28] worthy to be compared with the glory
[1:19:30] which shall be revealed where in US Paul
[1:19:34] is talking about the believer Having the
[1:19:36] Holy Spirit
[1:19:37] and when you have the Holy Spirit
[1:19:39] remember glorification you already
[1:19:41] glorify on the inside but now Paul is
[1:19:44] talking about another glorification that
[1:19:48] will happen in you remember there is two
[1:19:50] glorification two translation you
[1:19:53] remember that glory to God
[1:19:56] for the earnest expectation
[1:19:58] of the creature waits for the
[1:20:01] manifestation of the sons of God for the
[1:20:03] creature was made subject to vanity not
[1:20:06] willingly but by reason of him who has
[1:20:09] subjected the same in Hope
[1:20:11] because the creature itself also shall
[1:20:14] be delivered from the bondage of
[1:20:16] corruption into the water glorious
[1:20:19] Liberty it's a glorious Liberty of the
[1:20:22] children of God for we know that the
[1:20:25] whole creation remember this grown and
[1:20:28] traveling pain together until now watch
[1:20:32] this carefully
[1:20:33] and not only death nature but ourselves
[1:20:38] also
[1:20:39] which have the water first fruit so you
[1:20:42] cannot groan without the Holy Ghost In
[1:20:45] You
[1:20:47] it is the holy spirit that gets on you
[1:20:49] and begin to get uncomfortable of what
[1:20:52] is going on because he want to make sure
[1:20:55] whatever is around him is okay so when
[1:20:58] the Holy Ghost is moving he looks he
[1:21:00] said there is a black dog here
[1:21:03] you remember the white dog and a black
[1:21:05] dog then the fight to begin then the
[1:21:08] Holy Spirit begin to dominate
[1:21:11] everybody okay the black dog as much as
[1:21:15] you given or you paying attention to him
[1:21:20] the one you feed the most
[1:21:23] everybody okay which have the first
[1:21:26] fruit of the spirit even we ourselves do
[1:21:29] what grown grown inside ourselves
[1:21:33] waiting for the water adoption to do
[1:21:36] what witness to which the Redemption of
[1:21:39] our body
[1:21:41] why are you groaning because something
[1:21:44] is wrong with your body
[1:21:46] that's why we go to the hospital that's
[1:21:48] why we're getting coronavirus all of
[1:21:51] that because it's reminding you that
[1:21:52] something is wrong
[1:21:54] everybody okay that's why we start
[1:21:56] having gray hair it's telling you
[1:21:58] something is wrong everybody good let's
[1:22:01] go to First Corinthians 15.
[1:22:05] Oh Glory to God
[1:22:10] if you're there you can say Amen verse
[1:22:12] 40 the Bible says this
[1:22:15] they are also what
[1:22:21] the first body is a what celestial what
[1:22:25] is a Celestial body
[1:22:29] amen
[1:22:30] Celestial means from Heaven There are
[1:22:33] also Celestial body Karma and water for
[1:22:37] us to raise your body the second body is
[1:22:41] terrestrial
[1:22:44] terrestrial or Earthly
[1:22:48] meaning
[1:22:49] comes from here amen glory to God
[1:22:54] but the glory of the selection is what
[1:22:57] one in other words the celestial has its
[1:23:00] own Glory
[1:23:03] the celestial has its own Glory
[1:23:07] everybody okay
[1:23:09] if I'm not mistaken and the glory of the
[1:23:13] Teresa is water another another word the
[1:23:16] two have glories but those two glories
[1:23:18] are different remember last Sunday we
[1:23:21] explained to you about your glory what
[1:23:23] we spoke yesterday in the Sisters
[1:23:25] Meeting how to take care of your glory
[1:23:29] ah

[1:23:47] so also is the resurrection of the dead
[1:23:50] it is somehow in corruption it is raised
[1:23:53] how in corruption
[1:23:55] it is somehow in this honor it is raised
[1:24:00] how in glory
[1:24:01] which glory is always
[1:24:05] I thought he was already in glory
[1:24:09] but this glory is lighter than the glory
[1:24:13] that is going to come up with right
[1:24:15] everybody okay so when you are
[1:24:17] resurrected you will have a glory let me
[1:24:20] put it like number three here there is a
[1:24:23] glory
[1:24:25] so how many Glory do we have now

[1:30:06] Church not having water spot or what
[1:30:09] wrinkle or any such thing but it should

[1:30:24] Paul John says this he says beloved now
[1:30:30] are we the sons of God and he do not yet
[1:30:34] what appear what we what shall be so
[1:30:37] even though you are the Son of God you
[1:30:41] are not really reflecting what you are
[1:30:43] supposed to be
[1:30:45] everybody okay so the way we look at one
[1:30:48] another
[1:30:49] we are not really what we are supposed
[1:30:52] to be
[1:30:52] everybody okay another word now you have

[1:31:03] Jesus Christ we shall be like water him
[1:31:07] we cannot be different than him how was
[1:31:10] he
[1:31:11] how is he gonna look like
[1:31:13] for we shall see him as how he is
[1:31:18] and every man that have this hope in him
[1:31:22] do whatever purify himself even as he is
[1:31:26] water so he's not talking to people who
[1:31:29] are living unclean
[1:31:31] it's people that are pure by the inner
[1:31:34] men
[1:31:34] are we okay now buckle up and let's take

[1:32:10] soul be the Alpha and the Omega of this
[1:32:12] service as we commit each other unto the
[1:32:15] hand those that are hearing the one that
[1:32:17] is preaching the one who's translating
[1:32:19] and the one that are hearing through the
[1:32:21] translator father touch each one and
[1:32:24] those that are streaming in Jesus
[1:32:26] precious name amen
[1:32:29] glory to God okay my subject this
[1:32:32] morning
[1:32:33] is the four phases of roof
[1:32:37] the theophany
[1:32:39] and Resurrection
[1:32:43] we okay
[1:32:45] the four phases of roof but the theme
[1:32:48] today is theophany and what Resurrection
[1:32:53] we're still going back and forth between
[1:32:55] roof chapter 3 and roof chapter four
[1:32:58] everybody okay which is interpreted in
[1:33:01] the Tabernacle as the roof being in the
[1:33:05] holiest and getting ready to disappear
[1:33:08] to another Tabernacle everybody okay
[1:33:11] what is a theophany
[1:33:18] everybody okay
[1:33:20] by the
[1:33:22] root of the word
[1:33:25] theophany has two words
[1:33:29] everybody okay
[1:33:31] the first word is tears
[1:33:34] which means god
[1:33:36] everybody okay
[1:33:38] and the second word is called Fannin
[1:33:42] amen which is me which means to show
[1:33:47] and it's interpreted as an appearance
[1:33:54] everybody okay
[1:33:56] so by definition
[1:33:58] theophany is a visible
[1:34:04] manifestation or appearing of a god
[1:34:12] did I lost anyone
[1:34:14] to your family by definition is a
[1:34:18] visible manifestation
[1:34:21] manifestation or a visible appearing
[1:34:26] amen of a deity
[1:34:32] everybody okay but according to Psalm 86
[1:34:37] the Bible said yeah gods
[1:34:43] and all of you are the children of the
[1:34:46] water most high
[1:34:48] everybody okay
[1:34:50] so theophany is not only for God
[1:34:56] I'm going slowly
[1:35:02] is not only for God it is also for gods
[1:35:08] [Applause]
[1:35:11] I'm back
[1:35:12] everybody okay so far
[1:35:15] because we know that at the beginning
[1:35:18] God was the eternal spirit
[1:35:20] you remember that now
[1:35:22] everybody okay and from the eternal
[1:35:25] spirit God birthed himself you already
[1:35:28] understand this now when he birth
[1:35:31] himself he birthed from himself unto
[1:35:34] something that was called the logos
[1:35:38] which is the word
[1:35:41] everybody okay so God that's a spirit
[1:35:44] left this part here everybody care and
[1:35:49] God entered into that thing that he
[1:35:52] created
[1:35:56] the Bible says in Psalm 104 that God
[1:36:00] cover himself with light
[1:36:04] as a government
[1:36:06] everybody okay that light is what we
[1:36:09] call the logos
[1:36:11] it is also called the pillar of Fire
[1:36:16] everybody okay
[1:36:18] then God moved from this logos here
[1:36:21] after God veiled himself God wearing the
[1:36:25] first clothing
[1:36:27] everybody okay
[1:36:28] then God moved into flesh remember that
[1:36:32] we went through that many many times
[1:36:34] amen and when God moved to inflam to
[1:36:38] flesh everybody good whatever was here
[1:36:42] everybody clear that got into here he
[1:36:46] took this and this and put all of them
[1:36:49] in one
[1:36:53] everybody okay another word when God
[1:36:56] moved from the spirit into the logos God
[1:37:00] disappeared from here
[1:37:04] everybody okay now the Lord Gods become
[1:37:08] God
[1:37:09] [Applause]
[1:37:11] the fullness of the god word of of the
[1:37:15] godhead badly
[1:37:18] everybody okay then when God moved from
[1:37:21] this stage into this stage whatever was
[1:37:24] here disappear
[1:37:29] everybody okay so if God is in here amen
[1:37:34] you can go all around here you won't
[1:37:37] find God
[1:37:39] [Applause]
[1:37:40] [Music]
[1:37:42] everybody okay if you go right here you
[1:37:45] won't find God you will find God only on
[1:37:48] one place
[1:37:48] [Applause]
[1:37:49] that's why when Jesus keeps saying the
[1:37:52] Father the Father the father Philip said
[1:37:54] wait a minute show us the father
[1:38:00] Jesus look he said you don't understand
[1:38:02] Philip when you see me
[1:38:06] you are seeing the father
[1:38:08] in other words I am the manifestation I
[1:38:12] am the father made flesh
[1:38:15] me and my father are one
[1:38:21] everybody okay so far
[1:38:24] everybody good so far this process here
[1:38:28] brother Branham called this the regular
[1:38:30] line
[1:38:33] in other words it is the correct way
[1:38:38] everybody in this building should have
[1:38:41] come
[1:38:44] everybody good what is 80 or funny
[1:38:48] William Marion Branham glory to God
[1:38:52] bacola pretty good my friend as we going
[1:38:55] up brother Branham said the great
[1:38:58] fountain of all eternity was the spirit
[1:39:01] of love
[1:39:03] Joy
[1:39:04] number one and that spirit and uh that
[1:39:08] Spirit of honesty that Spirit of water
[1:39:11] trueness in its way in this water
[1:39:13] Perfection and then out
[1:39:16] of the existence of the water father
[1:39:19] went water the logos which was the sun
[1:39:22] which was a water the alphony so the
[1:39:26] second stage here which we call the
[1:39:28] logos is where your theophany is
[1:39:34] everybody good
[1:39:36] which is the body
[1:39:40] of the Great Water Jehovah God went
[1:39:43] forth in the water bless your body
[1:39:49] so your Celestial body is also called
[1:39:53] water
[1:39:58] any question
[1:40:01] glory to God he said that is the logos
[1:40:05] the word spoke out of them great
[1:40:08] Fountain of Life and went forth and
[1:40:12] there was the water the alphony which
[1:40:14] God was made into water
[1:40:20] everybody okay
[1:40:24] that's why we call that the word
[1:40:26] everybody okay this one was the spirit
[1:40:29] and the spirit is the father they call
[1:40:32] him father because he's the one that
[1:40:34] started
[1:40:35] the one that gave birth a girl a birth
[1:40:38] by a man
[1:40:45] everybody okay it is not our not trust
[1:40:51] he will tell me who was watching movies
[1:40:55] [Applause]
[1:40:57] everybody okay everybody okay the Bible
[1:41:00] said don't go Google that one the logos
[1:41:03] which was the son of God did what went
[1:41:06] out created by this great Fountain of
[1:41:09] Purity God as the spirit did whatever
[1:41:12] well now and he created the water he was
[1:41:15] a body he was in the form of what we are
[1:41:20] now
[1:41:23] everybody okay so this to your funny
[1:41:27] is a body that look like a terrestrial
[1:41:31] body
[1:41:35] everybody okay
[1:41:36] what is a theophany it is a body that
[1:41:41] does not have a water spirit in it push
[1:41:45] the brake
[1:41:47] push the brake
[1:41:49] everybody okay so the first body that
[1:41:53] started is the recipient called
[1:41:56] theophany
[1:41:58] everybody okay
[1:41:59] then the second body that we get into it
[1:42:03] is the the what we call the flesh
[1:42:07] or the terrorists yeah
[1:42:09] amen or the Earthly
[1:42:12] amen this one we call it Celestia we
[1:42:16] call it the logos we call it the word
[1:42:21] Etc everybody okay so you are here
[1:42:25] amen
[1:42:27] amen you can go here
[1:42:29] or you can go here you just changing
[1:42:32] body
[1:42:34] everybody okay but brother Branham say
[1:42:36] we went dead to your funny is formed
[1:42:39] it's a body that doesn't have a spirit
[1:42:43] on it

[1:46:44] this body here Paul called them also
[1:46:48] houses
[1:46:49] I want you to keep that in mind
[1:46:52] everybody okay so in the scripture when
[1:46:56] we say house you need to be careful
[1:47:04] let me help you up again because
[1:47:06] somebody needs some help one day Jesus
[1:47:09] was coming out of a temple
[1:47:12] everybody okay and he begin to look at
[1:47:15] the temple he looked he looked he looked
[1:47:18] he look he said wow the disciples said
[1:47:21] look how big it is look how Solomon
[1:47:23] built this and Jesus look at his stuff
[1:47:25] he say you know what let me tell you
[1:47:28] something destroy this Temple
[1:47:32] and I will build it in water
[1:47:34] they thought the Bible said he was
[1:47:37] talking about the building but the Bible
[1:47:40] said it's in John chapter 2. he was
[1:47:42] talking about his own water so your body

[1:47:50] everybody okay so this body here you can
[1:47:54] call it a house you can call it a temple
[1:47:57] and we can call it also a tabernacle

[2:07:51] he called that now a home
[2:07:54] [Applause]
[2:07:56] [Music]
[2:07:59] why we are how
[2:08:04] everybody okay while we are home
[2:08:07] in the water body
[2:08:09] stop remember brother Branham says here
[2:08:13] that it is a body that doesn't have what
[2:08:16] a spirit the spirit where
[2:08:19] in other words when they go if you go
[2:08:22] right now in heaven if they look in
[2:08:25] their body you are not there
[2:08:28] the reason why you are not there is
[2:08:31] because you are driving the Cadillac
[2:08:34] [Applause]
[2:08:37] everybody okay that's why Paul is saying
[2:08:40] when we are at home
[2:08:42] in number two what happened before the
[2:08:45] Lord
[2:08:47] while we are home in the body we are
[2:08:51] half absent from who the Lord in other
[2:08:54] words if God call in heaven where are
[2:08:57] you the theophan is looking
[2:09:01] because you are down there then the Holy
[2:09:04] Spirit have to come down and say where
[2:09:06] is she at she's in spoken word
[2:09:07] Tabernacle listening to the sermon this
[2:09:09] morning then the Holy Spirit Come he
[2:09:11] said okay there she is you are absent
[2:09:15] the Lord but you are present in the body
[2:09:20] but the main key is you are also there
[2:09:26] I don't know if you're getting me
[2:09:29] you are also there with your father
[2:09:35] your other vehicle is there
[2:09:38] [Applause]
[2:09:39] [Music]
[2:09:40] [Applause]
[2:09:41] [Music]
[2:09:45] you don't follow me
[2:09:47] if you are there it means that you come
[2:09:51] from where
[2:09:52] and if I come from God I will be
[2:09:55] [Applause]
[2:10:00] that's why you heard Jesus say I come
[2:10:02] from and I will do what
[2:10:07] because theophany is a manifestation of
[2:10:11] a what and what
[2:10:17] everybody okay everybody okay
[2:10:20] we good job to verse 8.
[2:10:24] we are water confident confident I say
[2:10:28] and women rather
[2:10:31] to be water absent from the water body
[2:10:34] stop
[2:10:36] Paul is saying I prefer even to leave
[2:10:39] this car
[2:10:41] because here I have a hard time seeing
[2:10:44] my father I have to pray pray fast fast
[2:10:48] two days three days four days pray pray
[2:10:51] before I can begin to feel the anointing
[2:10:53] but over there me and my father
[2:10:58] okay
[2:11:02] everybody okay
[2:11:04] everybody okay
[2:11:08] what are you trying to say let me pick
[2:11:11] up somebody you got two cars one is in
[2:11:14] the garage
[2:11:16] you are driving one
[2:11:18] Paul say in the garage at home that's
[2:11:21] where my father is
[2:11:22] I'd rather leave this car here and go
[2:11:25] with the car that is in the garage
[2:11:30] because the car in the garage is very
[2:11:33] close to the father then the car on the
[2:11:35] highway
[2:11:37] [Music]
[2:11:39] everybody good let's read verse six he's
[2:11:43] eight we are confidence I say of and
[2:11:46] willing rather to be how absent before
[2:11:48] from this from the body and be water
[2:11:51] present with the water so Paul is saying
[2:11:54] that when you are we are here we are
[2:11:58] absent here Paul said already live here
[2:12:01] because as soon as I'm not here you want
[2:12:04] to find me where
[2:12:08] in that word you cannot be living
[2:12:11] without a body
[2:12:15] foreign
[2:12:15] [Music]
[2:12:19] when you just about to leave this body
[2:12:22] are you following me this one comes
[2:12:25] already
[2:12:27] and park and open the door
[2:12:30] and it's already warm up the air
[2:12:33] conditioning is already working the
[2:12:35] climate is good it's just waiting as
[2:12:38] soon as you leave that one you enter
[2:12:40] that one and the Asha closes the the
[2:12:43] door and you start driving
[2:12:50] that's why death is only a
[2:12:54] doing
[2:12:57] you see what brother Branham said it is
[2:13:00] only something that is making you switch
[2:13:03] her
[2:13:05] [Music]
[2:13:08] Lord help me
[2:13:10] everybody okay
[2:13:12] go to Philippians chapter one
[2:13:14] let me at least get this
[2:13:16] my God this church this church this
[2:13:19] church
[2:13:21] laughs
[2:13:25] distant let's go to Philippians chapter
[2:13:28] one
[2:13:33] we there
[2:13:35] we there amen Philippians chapter 1
[2:13:38] verse 21. if you dare you can say amen
[2:13:41] amen listen to Paul for to me to leave
[2:13:45] his word Christ and to die is water
[2:13:48] again how can Paul say that
[2:13:51] in other words Paul is not even afraid
[2:13:53] of the devil anymore
[2:13:56] when the Devil comes he said go ahead
[2:13:57] and kill me
[2:13:58] you want to kill me it's again you kill
[2:14:02] me I'm going straight to the I I'm
[2:14:04] already Desiring that body because that
[2:14:07] one is eternal
[2:14:09] it doesn't get sick
[2:14:12] when coronavirus come over there when he
[2:14:15] hits the body remember he swallow death
[2:14:18] he swallow
[2:14:20] that body as soon as something comes you
[2:14:22] swallow it
[2:14:23] disappear
[2:14:25] Paul say he has suffered backache go
[2:14:28] ahead kill me I'm dead
[2:14:31] that's why to die is a game
[2:14:35] why to die is pushing me into here
[2:14:39] everybody okay verse 22 but if I live in
[2:14:44] the flesh number two
[2:14:46] this is the fruit of my what labor yet
[2:14:49] what shall I choose I know not for I am
[2:14:52] in a straight between what two
[2:14:55] Paul say now I'm debating
[2:14:58] I'm looking at the pro and cons
[2:15:01] I'm looking at the advantage here I'm
[2:15:04] suffering here things is going here
[2:15:07] there's no suffering I'm waiting between
[2:15:10] the two I'm trying to pick and choose
[2:15:13] everybody okay
[2:15:15] verse uh 23 for I am in straight in
[2:15:20] other words I'm stuck between two having
[2:15:23] a desire to what the power and to be
[2:15:26] with who Christ which is what far better
[2:15:29] so when you enter theophany is far
[2:15:31] better
[2:15:32] because he brings you close to your
[2:15:34] father everybody okay watch verse 24
[2:15:38] nevertheless to abide in the flesh is
[2:15:41] more water need for for who for who
[2:15:44] for who in other words Paul is saying if
[2:15:48] he was not for you the church I'd rather
[2:15:50] go
[2:15:51] but if I go I love you I want to make
[2:15:55] sure you're in a better position before
[2:15:57] I can go because to God it's better for
[2:16:00] me but if I go you will bury me you
[2:16:03] won't see me and if I stay it is on you
[2:16:05] for your advantage
[2:16:10] in other words either way the devil is
[2:16:13] losing
[2:16:15] [Applause]
[2:16:19] when they are staying or when they
[2:16:22] somebody die you have not lost anything
[2:16:28] hey

[2:44:02] what are you trying to say hold on and
[2:44:04] I'm gonna be lending this ship
[2:44:07] brother Branham says this he says there
[2:44:10] was a tree of life 64. in the Garden of
[2:44:13] Eden that he might have what eaten eaten
[2:44:16] from it if he had not failed that tree
[2:44:19] of life remanded him him who Adam all
[2:44:24] the time that his youth was what
[2:44:28] conditionally continually how going on
[2:44:33] everybody okay so Adam will grow
[2:44:37] in years on the inside
[2:44:42] but his body was still the same age
[2:44:46] are you following me
[2:44:48] God also created ease
[2:44:53] everybody okay when God created it
[2:44:56] instead of Eve coming up as a baby if
[2:44:59] also come up a grown-up woman ready to
[2:45:02] get married
[2:45:07] when God created if if was
[2:45:13] automatically Heaven period
[2:45:18] how could the devil get her pregnant
[2:45:25] everybody okay imagine what the original
[2:45:28] spoken word of God doesn't create babies
[2:45:33] didn't create babies
[2:45:36] he created grown-up people
[2:45:39] not all there in a certain age where
[2:45:43] they are younger and they are ready to
[2:45:45] get married but they don't grow old they
[2:45:48] don't get sick
[2:45:50] because death have not entered them yet
[2:45:54] they have not seen it because the wages
[2:45:57] of sin was death that's right everybody
[2:45:59] okay as long as death didn't struck Adam
[2:46:02] the body of Adam was still the same
[2:46:08] because brother Branham said the tree of
[2:46:10] life was reminding him that you are
[2:46:12] staying young
[2:46:14] everybody okay youth continually
[2:46:16] everybody okay but once Adam and Eve
[2:46:20] disobey are you following me and sin
[2:46:24] entering suddenly
[2:46:26] after five years
[2:46:28] Adam seen something changing
[2:46:32] his body begin to react differently than
[2:46:36] before
[2:46:37] he begin to have the marks of death

[2:49:48] was going to be another thing grow up or
[2:49:51] Adam he just made them in his own image
[2:49:54] and that is the way he shall do it again
[2:49:57] that is a full grown-up water statue of
[2:50:00] people in other words the way God
[2:50:02] created Adam he created Adam at the
[2:50:06] standard of his theophany
[2:50:13] everybody okay everybody okay so if you
[2:50:17] have the loved one that have gone
[2:50:19] go search the picture when they were
[2:50:22] younger
[2:50:24] begin to recalibrate your mind
[2:50:28] everybody okay everybody okay if you
[2:50:31] have a baby that was gone
[2:50:34] don't worry when you see him you will
[2:50:37] see the real him
[2:50:39] everybody okay brother brought him say
[2:50:42] every couple skill everywhere when you
[2:50:45] was at your best right at the water Peak
[2:50:49] God said now the pictures is painted
[2:50:52] that is what I want in my great what
[2:50:54] millennium that is how coming
[2:50:57] I want Adams
[2:50:59] and if
[2:51:01] because Adam never leave it as in you
[2:51:04] now I'm gonna bring note on one Adam
[2:51:07] many Adams and many ifs and put them on
[2:51:11] Earth from one thousand year to prove
[2:51:15] the devil that there will be an Adam and
[2:51:18] Eve you won't do anything
[2:51:21] back on up we're going to the airport
[2:51:23] he said this there you are but you can't
[2:51:27] take them now you can go to working on
[2:51:29] them but you can take them till I can
[2:51:31] care I can call your hand and then in
[2:51:34] the great Resurrection then we will come
[2:51:36] forth everything that death did to us it
[2:51:40] is finish at death and then when we wake
[2:51:44] up to a new laugh
[2:51:45] wouldn't that be wonderful all the water
[2:51:48] gray hair is water gone the old Edge
[2:51:51] Water moved away and we won't be armed
[2:51:54] forever please forever in the beauty of
[2:51:57] the Lord and never have to be half sick
[2:52:00] never have to be helped oh never have to
[2:52:02] take what medicine never be in the water
[2:52:05] Hospital
[2:52:07] won't that be wonderful
[2:52:12] everybody okay everybody okay
[2:52:15] when you come forth in the resurrection
[2:52:18] you are not going to be one thing that
[2:52:20] symbols is what sin you growed you
[2:52:24] become at your what best I think science
[2:52:27] claim between 20 and what 23 that you
[2:52:31] are at your Peak after that you start
[2:52:33] dying
[2:52:36] So Adam was at a certain age when death
[2:52:40] struck him he started
[2:52:42] everybody okay God gets the picture up
[2:52:45] marries you remember we marry Abram Adam
[2:52:48] put you together like the first Adam and
[2:52:52] what is and give you a choice almost
[2:52:55] then I land the ship when you was about
[2:52:58] 16 or 20 you was around your best I
[2:53:02] guess it was about how 20 and what 21
[2:53:06] and I think the cell which is their best
[2:53:12] so the age Adam was created was the
[2:53:16] limit that death cannot touch
[2:53:23] almost
[2:53:24] say there is the whole plan laying right
[2:53:27] there how God created me in the water
[2:53:30] beginning I come down here on Earth
[2:53:32] taking my place as the gospel preacher
[2:53:35] as you as a man or a woman with water
[2:53:37] salvation We Live the Life by the water
[2:53:40] grace of God hallelujah and that same
[2:53:43] great spirit here that was back Yonder
[2:53:46] in the water beginning it shall go back
[2:53:48] to the conscience of knowing I'll be
[2:53:51] there Hallelujah and then wait there
[2:53:53] under the water alter blessed house
[2:53:56] forever in what and then when returning
[2:53:59] back I will take up my body it's very
[2:54:03] big of water before death ever
[2:54:10] probably last one
[2:54:12] let's see how bad now here is the
[2:54:16] Glorious part on the return of Jesus at
[2:54:19] the resurrection he won't be that body
[2:54:22] that body then that supernatural being
[2:54:25] that God created in the beginning that
[2:54:28] will return to the Earth to get another
[2:54:30] body not born of a what woman Adam but
[2:54:34] created by God to never get what oh or
[2:54:38] have what wrinkles never have a water go
