[1:17:43] to comment on the pastor already
[1:17:46] preached about
[1:17:47] it the Bible says
[1:17:52] this

[1:18:35] king's gate closed with s
[1:18:37] CL with sth

[1:18:51] came
[1:18:54] there was great mouring among the
[1:18:57] Jews and fasting and
[1:18:59] weeping and
[1:19:02] Welling and many lay in s clothes and

[1:19:32] days night or
[1:19:34] day I also and my men will fast
[1:19:38] like with my
[1:19:40] maidens and so will I go into the King
[1:19:44] which is not according to the law and if
[1:19:47] I perish I
[1:19:49] perish
[1:19:51] amen you heard
[1:19:54] it there was a
[1:19:57] trial they were about to kill all the
[1:20:02] Jews because the enemy of the Jews
[1:20:06] hon he had that
[1:20:09] conspiracy to kill them
[1:20:12] all but how did God destroy that
[1:20:16] plan when Mor heard about
[1:20:20] it he sent a message to Queen
[1:20:26] no matter if you live in a Royal Palace
[1:20:28] or not don't think you're going to be
[1:20:32] spared because you also are a
[1:20:36] Jew you got to take care of us you must
[1:20:39] speak to the king and Es told
[1:20:44] him it has been a long time I never went
[1:20:46] to the
[1:20:48] king and it's not according to the
[1:20:51] custom
[1:20:54] so this is what we're going to be doing
[1:20:57] we're going to get into prayer we're
[1:20:59] going to speak to our God we going to go
[1:21:02] high we going to climb and speak to the
[1:21:04] Lord now tonight we going to speak to
[1:21:07] the
[1:21:08] Lord and they
[1:21:10] fasted and then they watch three days it
[1:21:15] changed the entire
[1:21:17] situation it changed the entire
[1:21:20] situation and that same God is here
[1:21:23] tonight that same God is here
[1:21:28] tonight let me tell you
[1:21:30] something
[1:21:32] remember
[1:21:35] Esther all those people in the Old
[1:21:40] Testament they had no reference like we
[1:21:43] have
[1:21:45] today they didn't have any reference in
[1:21:48] the Bible to cling onto God like we
[1:21:50] doing
[1:21:51] today
[1:21:54] but on suay the pastor showed us that
[1:21:57] everything that was written in the Old
[1:21:58] Testament was for our learning and
[1:22:02] instruction he was for our
[1:22:05] instructions to prepare
[1:22:07] us that's the reason why we come to
[1:22:10] church and the pastor is teaching us to
[1:22:13] prepare us to Tempest because Tri will
[1:22:18] come but we're not going to
[1:22:21] suum God did say we going to
[1:22:24] fail God didn't say that you will fail
[1:22:27] he never say that hallelujah
[1:22:32] hallelujah if you look at the life of
[1:22:34] Jesus
[1:22:36] Christ he said when every higher
[1:22:39] position can even his own son was not
[1:22:42] spared every time you go into a higher
[1:22:45] position he brings always
[1:22:48] Tri if God have something good in you
[1:22:53] there will be a trial in your
[1:22:55] life know that God is with you God have
[1:22:59] confidence in you that's why Trials come
[1:23:03] the Bible says that there is no trial
[1:23:06] that is going to be greater than your
[1:23:08] power hallu
[1:23:15] Hallelujah in Matthew chapter
[1:23:19] 26
[1:23:21] 3839 Mar Mark
[1:23:26] 14
[1:23:29] 3436 Mark
[1:23:33] 1534 you can see the trial of
[1:23:37] Jesus before the name of Jesus Christ be
[1:23:40] above every other
[1:23:43] name had to come in his life the same
[1:23:49] prayer if it's possible for the Lord to
[1:23:51] take the cup
[1:23:54] way let's read even
[1:23:59] Something
[1:24:00] [Music]
[1:24:03] Matthew Matthew chapter
[1:24:06] 26 I'm going to read
[1:24:09] quickly Matthew 26 yes
[1:24:15] M verse
[1:24:21] 36
[1:24:26] the word of the Lord says
[1:24:28] this the Bible doesn't declare this
[1:24:32] glory be to
[1:24:34] God because most of the time we say the
[1:24:37] Bible say no the Bible is a
[1:24:40] book but it's the word of God declaring
[1:24:43] it's God speaking
[1:24:46] amen may the Lord help us to correct
[1:24:50] that the Bible says this the word of the
[1:24:52] Lord says
[1:24:54] this then came
[1:24:58] Jesus 38 actually then said he unto
[1:25:03] them my soul is exceedingly
[1:25:07] sorrowful even unto death you here and
[1:25:10] watch with
[1:25:11] me and he went a little further and fell
[1:25:15] on his
[1:25:17] face fell on his
[1:25:20] face and pray saying
[1:25:23] oh my
[1:25:24] father if it be possible let this pass
[1:25:30] from me
[1:25:32] nevertheless not as I
[1:25:35] will but as th
[1:25:38] will amen
[1:25:42] amen this is Jesus Christ
[1:25:45] himself 100% man and 100% God this is
[1:25:51] before
[1:25:54] he said Lord if you can spare me from
[1:25:56] this
[1:25:57] cup to show you that trial is not again
[1:26:02] but how did he
[1:26:05] overcame amen hallelujah
[1:26:09] hallelujah let me
[1:26:12] take
[1:26:15] Mark Mark 15:34 if you can allow me
[1:26:21] to
[1:26:34] 1534 and and at the ninth
[1:26:37] hour Jesus cried with a loud
[1:26:43] voice
[1:26:47] saying which is being interpreted my God
[1:26:51] my God
[1:26:53] why has Thou forsaken
[1:26:55] me do You Realize here in the in the
[1:26:59] situation Jesus found himself in he even
[1:27:03] cried that was a hard
[1:27:06] trial that was a hard
[1:27:11] trial and every time he came
[1:27:14] back he always found his disciples
[1:27:16] felling asleep those that he called them
[1:27:19] to pray for him he
[1:27:22] John Peter and James to help him to pray
[1:27:27] but they could not even support him in
[1:27:28] their praying he prayed
[1:27:32] alone because he had to face the devil
[1:27:35] because he had to face the enemy because
[1:27:37] he had to face death amen
[1:27:41] amen and he was able to embrace death
[1:27:45] his
[1:27:47] enemy that's how he
[1:27:49] overcame and you will notice
[1:27:53] that that Jesus Christ went in G and
[1:27:57] when he was in G and he was in
[1:28:00] G that's why we pray that's why we we we
[1:28:05] surrender that's why we we look for for
[1:28:09] for power for strength and he was
[1:28:11] praying in Geth like
[1:28:15] Peter never experienced
[1:28:18] that he didn't have a Gest in his no his
[1:28:22] own life that's why he became killing
[1:28:25] people cutting people's
[1:28:27] ear he cut the ear of
[1:28:30] someone and he denied the Lord Jesus
[1:28:32] Christ three times why did he do it
[1:28:36] because when he was time for prayer when
[1:28:38] Jesus told them to
[1:28:40] prayer never
[1:28:42] pray he was always
[1:28:46] sleeping but when Jesus stay
[1:28:49] awake he was able to sustain
[1:28:53] trial he was able to go and then have
[1:28:57] Judah amen amen hallelujah
[1:29:02] hallelujah
[1:29:08] hallelujah take Philippians chapter 2
[1:29:11] verse
[1:29:13] 9 I want you to to show you something
[1:29:18] there I want you to see that Jesus
[1:29:23] before every higher position in your
[1:29:26] life they always come with
[1:29:30] trial why is the name of Jesus Christ
[1:29:33] above every other name
[1:29:41] why if you are home you can start by
[1:29:43] verse three you can do your own reading
[1:29:46] at
[1:29:48] home I'm going to take eight and n to
[1:29:52] show
[1:29:56] you he humbled
[1:30:00] himself and then being obedient unto
[1:30:04] death even the death of the Cross
[1:30:10] wherefore God also had highly exalted
[1:30:14] him you see now the condition be before
[1:30:17] you are highly elevated before you
[1:30:20] become exalted
[1:30:23] and gave him a name which is above every
[1:30:27] name so that in heaven on the earth
[1:30:32] underneath the
[1:30:33] Earth every knee shall bow every tongue
[1:30:36] shall confess that Jesus Christ is
[1:30:39] Lord remember
[1:30:42] now we don't have three Gods we don't
[1:30:45] have two Gods there is only one
[1:30:47] God when Jesus Christ came
[1:30:52] work like a
[1:30:54] son
[1:30:56] amen he was in the office of a
[1:30:59] son or the one who was in
[1:31:03] heaven because he T his
[1:31:05] disciple nobody went to heaven except
[1:31:08] the son of man who came down from
[1:31:13] heaven because in the Old
[1:31:15] Testament Isaiah 35 and so forth is
[1:31:19] Isaiah promised that Emmanuel
[1:31:22] the cons shall come someone who will
[1:31:25] heal someone who will resurrect people
[1:31:28] someone who will deliver
[1:31:31] people that person was God himself
[1:31:34] coming down they never say God Son they
[1:31:37] say the almighty
[1:31:39] God and we saw the almighty God veil in
[1:31:43] Jesus
[1:31:44] Christ that's the reason
[1:31:48] why his word
[1:31:50] declared in him dwelleth the fullness of
[1:31:54] the godhead
[1:31:58] badly now watch the person who was God
[1:32:01] in flesh
[1:32:02] AC he accepted to play the part of a son
[1:32:07] AC he accepted to be humiliated AC he
[1:32:13] accepted to die at the death of the
[1:32:16] Cross which is a horrible
[1:32:20] death when crucify
[1:32:23] someone usually they are cursed people
[1:32:27] but he accepted that
[1:32:29] place that's the reason why in
[1:32:31] Philippian 2 the Bible says that after
[1:32:34] all of this after being humbled that's
[1:32:38] why his name was exalted above all
[1:32:42] name that's just to show
[1:32:46] you that sooner your exaltation is
[1:32:50] coming but through trial
[1:32:53] and When Trials come what do you have to
[1:32:57] do you must awake the master you must
[1:33:01] Shake him up you must Shake him up you
