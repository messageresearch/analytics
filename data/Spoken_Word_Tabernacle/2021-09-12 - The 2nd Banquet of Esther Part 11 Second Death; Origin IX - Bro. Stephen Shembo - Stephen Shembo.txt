over a year ago but the doctor didn't agree with me but i kind of told her that i was still taking it but i wasn't but about what three or four months ago when i went to panama i went to the doctor and i told him that i would like some like a test to check my thyroid so they checked it and it was normal so when i came back i went to the doctor here in charlotte and because we don't have health insurance right now but i went to some some other doctor that someone recommended me so i went over there and i told her that uh she did a physical and she said you're taking any medication and i say no right now i said i was suffering with thyroid but no not any longer and she's like you do know that once you suffer from tyro you will never stop taking the medications she said you will be on that medication until you die and and i said well can you check it she goes okay and her nurse told me the same thing you shouldn't stop taking it because you take medication for tyler forever so anyways they did they took bald blood and they did the test and about thursday they called me they told me all my exams all the tests came out normal that i didn't have [Applause] amen hallelujah she was real happy we were coming through the mountains and somehow got that message when we got a signal we drove through a portion of a place up there um called crusoe and apparently this last hurricane that went through ida i guess the flooding was really bad we were driving through and there was a lot of campgrounds right on the river a river but all you saw were piles of rubble stick you know boards and there'd be i mean cars in the tree boats in the ditch a jet ski in the middle of a field and i you know we just kind of just asked god for mercy on those people because i had never seen anything like that i was i experienced some flooding up in north dakota on the red river when the snow's melted but never never the damage like this so um this is kind of north of brevard and south of

moving in into his word amen we appreciate everybody that worked yesterday i know we had a work day and quite a few people showed up so god richly bless you i know it was a lot of work may god strengthen you yeah the brother david worked almost all day so he had to stay here with brother mike and assembly everything and put everything in order like this with brother kelly so it looks beautiful it looks clean and everything looks nice amen so my board is no longer here sorry for this side the board is on the other side amen blessed be the name of the lord let's go straight to our scripture this morning i hope this clicker will pick it up from here you should there we go finally i know when you're going to be seated it's going to work somebody's blocking the wave [Laughter] so let's go to genesis chapter 15. the screen look pretty good so there is interference with the human molecules genesis chapter 15. if you're there you can say amen how many are on board with the sermon i want to make sure nobody's lagging behind amen everybody clear okay if you're behind it's on youtube genesis chapter 15. after these things the word of the lord came to abram in a vision we read this on wednesday but could not get into it saying fear not abram i am your shield and your exceeding great reward everybody clear you might be seated and keep your bible with you because we need it it should work now brother robert let me see let me see now okay somebody need to be in tune with me go ahead and click it did you click it okay click it again okay let's go there maybe somebody's gonna stay there clicking it i trust that we can get wired together with the holy spirit verse two and abraham said lord god what will you give me seeing i go childless and the steward of my house is this eliezer of damascus in other words god i don't have a child and based on my human ability there is someone here in my house called eliezer i believe this is the one you are actually pointing me that he's going to be the heir and god answer abraham in verse 3 he say behold and abraham said behold to me you have given no seed i'm sorry and no one born in my house is my heir verse 4 and behold the word of the lord came to him saying this shall not be your heir not earlier of damascus this is human ability but he that shall come forth out of your own bowels shall be your heir everybody clear verse five and he brought him forth abroad in other words come out of your house and say look now toward heaven everybody clear so we got to go back again in the heaven if you were there on wednesday it makes sense look toward heaven when i say it makes sense it's not this brain here before somebody say he's saying making sense making sense amen look now toward heaven and tell the star so god attracted abraham attention to the storm in other words you're looking too much earthly the problem is not on the earth the problem is way down in heaven amen tell the star if you'll be able to number them and he said to him so shall your seed remember on wednesday singular not plural so shall your seed be so what abraham looked at that was not really the natural star but abraham look into christ amen but christ has a bunch of stars or a bunch of seeds you remember the morning stars amen blessed be the name of the lord let's go to number chapter 16. so keep that in mind the stars are in heaven and god told abraham look at those stars that's the way that you see it is going to be amen hallelujah number chapter 16. if you dare you can say amen quite a bit of reading i might try to skip some of them verse 1 now korra the son of isa the son of gohan the son of who so korra was a leaver and if you need a scripture he was actually a cousin to moses if you need a scripture you see me i'm going to show you korra was a cousin to moses so he was fighting his own cousin from the same tribe right not all israel is and dayton and abiram the sons of elia and on the son of pellet sons of ruben they took men plural after everything that moses have done after all the demonstration that moses said after all the vindication that moses came who would have thought somebody can rebel against moses what a vindication a man when he's walking by night you can see a light going on and everybody sees it not only moses himself everybody see the pillar of fire by day you can see the pillar of fire moving you thought all israel will be scared like you know what we can't touch this man but no the star the zodiac is working verse two and they rose up before moses with certain of the children of israel not the hidden we are in israel 250 princes of the assembly so among those that god rescued from egypt 250 pieces kora dayton abram didn't really go with the message really amen families in the congregation not ordinary people famous people men of renown the entire world knows them [Music] 250. and they gathered themselves together against who and against who moses was the prophetic ministry and aaron was the priesthood and said to them you take too much upon you all the time moses said moses say moses say what he's saying all the time the whole congregation of israel is holy why only is it that only two people are holy you take too much upon you seeing all the congregation of water in other words everybody you just like anybody [Music] but it seems like your position is a little bit higher than anybody [Music] every one of them and the lord is among them it is not just you everybody can preach the gospel amen wherefore then lift you up yourself above the water you know who did that in heaven right he was luciferite appointing moses to be like a lucifer a mix verse 4 and when moses heard it he fell upon his face and spoke to who i thought there were three of them all four why only korra the big shot and he spoke to korra and to all his water so everybody was behind cora moses and his cousin micah and lucifer micah has his angel his company lucifer also have his angel but at the beginning both of them serve god until a certain time the separation happen god never created the devil you remember that he didn't create satan he created lucifer satan came after lucifer okay blessed be the name of the lord and this and spoke to cora and to all his companies saying even tomorrow the lord will show who is who are who and who is in other words you thought the entire congregation of israel is holy god is going to show you who belongs to him and who is truly holy amen and will cause him to come near to him even him whom he has chosen will he cause to come near to him so there is one that was chosen here and god is going to designate who is that person verse six this do take you censors korra and all his company and put fire therein and put incense in them before the lord tomorrow and it shall be that the man whom the lord does choose he shall be who you take too much upon you you sons of hope you exaggerated you got the priesthood so you think you can tackle anybody verse 8 and moses said to korra here i pray you you sons of liver he's talking to korra but sons of liver since it but a small thing to you that the god of israel has separated you from the congregation of israel to bring you near to himself to do the service of the tabernacle of the lord and to stand before the congregation to minister to him god already gave you a position you're already by predestination as a leaver you already have a mistake or a position like lucifer god already gave it to you now you're trying to lose that position what's going on anybody verse 10 and he has brought you near to him like like lucifer the right hand man of god and all your brethren the sons of liver with you and seek you the priesthood also when we talk about liver liver was divided between the leviton and the priest here the priest came from aaron and the remaining sons of liver were levat working also in the tabernacle everybody so cora was here he already have a position chosen by god and moses is saying god already gave you your position but it seems like you are not satisfied with the position god will give you and you want to leave this position and to become priests lucifer i already gave you a throne i already gave you a position but lucifer was not satisfied with the position god gave him lucifer want to rise above the star of god and be like the most high so there is any satisfaction to the position in the quran everybody clear so seek you the priesthood also do you want the priesthood now you already got a position chosen by god given by god you're not satisfied there now you want to take a different position for which cause both you and your company and all your company are gathered together against who i thought they were against moses standing against moses is standing against him and what is aaron that's inaudible that you murmur against him and moses sent to call dayton and abhiram and the son of eliab which said we will not come up so when they call them lack of respect i won't go tell him i'm not coming up spirit don't die spirit don't die they don't die they're still living today amen look at these people they told moses go tell moses i'm not coming up i won't come back anymore amen is he a small thing that you have brought us up out of the land that flows what and what was milk and honey flowing in egypt am i reading a different bible if milka honey was flowing in egypt why were you crying [Music] now they brought you out of egypt to the message of the hour now egypt become milk and honey [Music] oh my god to kill us in the wilderness except you make yourself altogether water so you brought us here so you can make a move and you be the top so all the time moses said moses said moses said amen brother branham say brother brother i'm saying brother branham say now it's a show man 14 moreover you have not brought us into a land that flows with milk and honey in other words you're a liar [Music] [Applause] they were geared to material stuff we want a prosperity gospel or giving us inheritance of field and vineyard when you put up would you when you put up the eyes of this man you won't deceive us we will not come up and moses was very angry and said to the lord respect not you their offering i have not taken one ass from them neither have i heard one of them and moses said to her be you and all your company before the lord you and day and aaron tomorrow and take every man his censor and put incense in them and bring you before the lord every man his censor 250 censors there were 350 men you also and aaron each of you he's water jump to verse 26 and he spoke to the congregation god came down i'm skipping that saying depart i pray you from the tents of this who so these levites were wicked i thought they were jews amen this is god giving his sentence wicked man and touch not touch nothing of theirs lest you be consumed in all their sins amen verse 27 so they gather from the tabernacle of who one tabernacle quran dating and abraham on every side and dayton and abraham came out and stood in the door of their tents and their who and there and and moses say hereby you shall know that the lord has sent me to do all this work for i have not done them of my own mind this word this message was not coming from my head if these men died the common death of all men or if they be visited brother kelly after the visitation of all men then the lord has not sent me but if the lord make a new thing everybody and the earth opened her mouth [Music] when john was crying to have the book of redemption john cried and there was no kinsmen the bible said he look where he look where in heaven and then whereas and where else underneath the earth we have a dimension here a dimension here and i mentioned there moses is saying that the earth will do what so this dimension is going to open up we okay now we got it the earth opened her mouth and swallowed them up with all that be turned to them and to go down quick into the water do you know what the pit pities the bottomless so these guys their destination is under here that is the temporary residence [Laughter] amen then you shall understand that these men have provoked me the lord amen verse 32 and the earth open its mouth and swallow them up and their houses and all the men that are that are pertained to korra and all their goods they and all that are pertained to them went down alive into the water the old testament is a shadow they're going alive into the fifth dimension underneath the earth into hell and the earth closed upon them so that earth open and close you okay and they perish from among them god removed that portion among the congregation that portion of israel that was not israel god pack them together gather them together separate yourself now there is a clear demarcation okay let me now swallow that up anybody clear and all israel that were round about them fled and cry of them for they said lest the earth swallows up swallow us up also and there came out a water there is a peat and a fire and a fire from the lord and consumed the 250 men that offered water kora elevate a cousin to moses part of israel at the beginning serve god in the meekness and quietness but after a while rose against moses but he was not alone he has a company that belongs to him we clear now now let's go to the book of revelation we start from abraham from abraham his seed are the stars of heaven amen so we believe now that we understand now that every star of heaven are children of abraham let's see revelation chapter 12. revelation chapter 12 verse 3. if you dare you can say amen hallelujah you there and there appear another wonder in water we're back again here we clear in heaven and behold a great head red dragon having seven heads and ten horns and seven crowns upon his head everybody knows that dragon the old who is the okay you need that scripture you can go back to the other one verse 4 and his tale what kind of tell is that one drew the water part of water so not all the star of heaven belongs to abraham because a third of them were completely removed by the dragon amen at the beginning the star belonged to abraham at the beginning all israel behind moses but a dragon must rise in the wilderness and get his company from under moses we clear now and the third part of the stars of heaven indeed cast them to the water so somebody fall somebody fell from heaven they had a position in heaven but the dragon took them from heavenly position and brought them to a carnal position everybody so somebody lost their first position therefore their position were in heaven now they begin to be creature of thee it's a losing opposition everybody clear amen indeed cast them to the earth and the dragon stood before the woman which was ready to be delivered for to devour her child as soon as he was born number one the stars of heaven are the children of abraham all of them christ here but we found out that everybody under moses but not really everybody a leader one must rise and get his children or his company together amen and in the book of revelation the star of heaven some of them have been deceived by lucifer let's go to genesis chapter 25 then we're going to pray you open your bible right there and you leave it right there that's why we stop on wednesday blessed be the name of the lord genesis 25 verse 20. if you're there you can say amen let's pray that heavenly father lord we are approaching you again humbly this morning father thanking you for everything and for giving us an opportunity to be gathered together around the revealed word of the hour lord we have done what any man that you give an ability lord can do open the pages of the scripture read them lord but when it comes to ministering to your children that takes nothing else but an act of the holy spirit lord may you move me completely out of the way may you come down and speak to your children lord we seal the devil and every spirit of coronavirus every problem every fear every resentment every kind of demonic spirit that is trying to trouble your children father will rebuke them away from this place to the dry places in the name of jesus christ may you start with us lord and be the ending and bless us lord as we commit it all in the name of jesus christ amen god bless you you've already been seated praise be the name of the lord we on origin part nine amen we already discussed about this and we've seen that there are two camp based on the origin or two kingdom one is the eternal camp which is the camp of god and the other camp is the temporal camp which is the camp of lucifer and his children ever clear when we look at the eternal camp brother branham says in the things that ought to be he says the only way that you can be a son come on a daughter of god because you have to have eternal life and there is only one form of eternal life and that is god's life only one form of eternal life and that was god to be a son of god you have to be in him how many time that's why we are eternal with god brother david just a little bit amen the gene of your life not your natural life your spiritual life tonight was in hole in god the father because he's your uh the one that a general you he said the god the father before there was even a molecule about here and you are nothing but the manifestation of the gene life that was in god as a son of god now you are expressed after his word has come in you remember the word coming to the word the present sinister seed which is the china tap everybody clear to light up this age you are expressing god's life in you because you are a son or a daughter of god therefore you get what i mean congregation saying you are now made you are sitting in this church tonight because your duty is to express god to this nation and to these people and to this neighborhood here where you associate so based on your origin there is a purpose for you on this earth either you're going to be a vessel of mercy that's going to show the riches of glory of jesus christ or you're going to be a vessel of wrath that is going to show how god can demonstrate his judgment upon someone everybody clear so far now as we're looking at this we went into the angelic realms but before we get into the angelic realm i want you to remember this brother bonham says that any bible readers knows that all scripture has a compound meaning every prophecy some almost all of it has a water a jew a time there or two times or water that it shall be answered as a revolving of what so prophecy can begin now and he's gonna repeat it again and repeat it again and repeat it again and repeat it again amen because god has an unchanged pattern he's the same yesterday today and you can predict god bless you so far now as we get into these angelic realms here the bible says this one here even though we have two kingdoms we have the kingdom of the devil and we have the kingdom of god according to matthew 13 there were there was only one field amen there were one field about two everybody clear the first sword went and saw first el bakir and the other one came later on when people were sleeping everybody so they were two seed into one field amen now that field the scripture said the field was the world so that shows that in this world here god have his children scatter all over the world some are in america some are in africa some are in europe some are in south america some are in asia some are in australia all of them are scattered all around the world but we came from one source the division of the nation of the earth is uh is responsible for our separation but surely we came from one source that's why the bible says in the book of revelation chapter 5 that they sang a new song saying that are worthy to take the book and to open the seals thereof for that was slain come on and has done water bring us back to god by that blood out of water and water and water and water and has made us unto god and unto god water and welcome we become leader melchizedek because melchizedek was a priest and a king so we become melchizedek who was at the beginning because melchizedek became jesus christ but at the beginning he was the word logos the theophany that have no beginning no ending everybody clear so out of every chunk every tribe every kindred god is pulling his children ever care but if you notice on verse eight the bible says that when he take he had taken the book the four beasts and the four and twenty elder fell down before the lamb having every one of them harp and golden vowel full of others which are the prayers of the center and they who are they who are they the four beasts and who why are the four beasts and the 24 out there singing the song of redemption the four beasts ever clear are the four anointings we already know that everybody clear the first one is who the second one the third one and the fourth one is who a flying ego everybody clear then we have 24 elders and the 24 hours we know that 12 of them are who the patriarch elbakir and the other 12 are who the apostles anybody clear if you go back in the garden of eden you okay keep your seat belt i'm maneuvering there is an asteroid so when i move the plane like this just understand i'm trying to dodge an asteroid everybody clear so when you go back in the book of genesis in the garden of eden we had the tree of life everybody and that tree of life was who everybody clear when men fell and sinned god brought the caribbeans anybody clear and the kerry beams came around and broke the entrance to the tree of life so from the very beginning in eden we found out that the throne of god was there and the kerry beams all the four beasts were there as well anybody clear so far then when we begin to move on you okay i'm talking about the tribes the apostles and the four anointing in the old testament in genesis christ was there in the garden of eden and the four beasts were there when jacob came down the road jacob brought the twelve patriarch everybody here you clear then when moses came moses brought the patriarch out of the land of egypt and as they were traveling through the wilderness moses put those tribes in a certain order three tribes on the east three tribes on the west three tribes on the north and three tribes on the south and there were four corners with twelve tribes everybody clear in other words moses took the number 4 and number 12 and put it together moses took the beast everybody clear and the 12th patriarch and put them together ever here that's why brother branham says that israel have seven church ages and barbeque ever clear so far so when we come in the new testament we found jesus christ came down and started at the beginning of the new testament here so in the new testament we also found christ there but christ is surrendered by four gospel in the old testament christ was surrendered by four beasts in the new testament at the beginning christ is surrendered by the forebear for gospel and brother branham said matthew was delighted he said mark was the ox he said look the doctor was there a man and john who was a prophet was a flying ego ever clear and just after christ came the twelve patriarchy and when jesus christ also came he brought the 12th apostle everybody clear so far and after the 12th apostle when we get to the seventh church jesus john pick up the four beasts and combined them with their apostle because the church is built upon the foundation of hope and jesus christ himself being the chief water everybody clear so you can see from genesis all the way to revelation you have the four anointing you have the patriarch and you have the apostle everybody clear and when you go to the new jerusalem you're going to find all of this part together everybody so far i'm deviating and not showing you there in revelation 21 the bible says and there came unto me one of the seven angels which had the seven vows you know him full of the seven last flag and talk with me we know his brother branham saying come here i will surely the bride the lambs who you thought he was a woman and he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain and show me a water that bread is water the holy jerusalem descending out of heaven from who verse 12 and he had and had a wall great and high and had how many gates and at the gate to have water and the name written thereof without the which are the name of who the patriarch everybody here verse 14 on the same city and the fall and the walls of the city have how many 12 foundations and in them the name of who everybody here so far and in revelation 22 verse 1 and he showed me a pure river of water clear crystal proceeding out of the throne of what so the new jerusalem have the throne of god which is surrendered by the four caribbeans and he also have the twelve apostles and he also have the twelve child put it together ever clear so when you talk about redemption for human being you always work with number four and number twelve those numbers work together and continue to move all around from genesis all the way to revelation everybody cleared so far i hope i didn't lose somebody everybody cleared so far yeah we just dodged it everybody clear so far blessed be the name of the lord now in jude chapter verse 6 the bible says that the angels which kept not their first listen their first position but left their own habitation and he had reserved into everlasting chain under darkness unto the judgment of the great day in other words these angels had a position just like horror had a position but at a certain time they lost their position and when they lost their position god took them and put them in chain or into a prison and we know that prison was hell [Music] but when we looked at hell the bible says this the bible says that then he shall say also unto them that are under those human beings remember on wednesday depart from me ye who occurs he curse into everlasting water prepare for the devil and his water how can a human being get in a place that is prepared from the devil and his angel we found out on wednesday when we speak about the word angel on wednesday angel means what it means man it means angel and he also means what tio funny everybody care if you miss wednesday you need to go back and get it ever clear now how do how do human beings get into hell ever clear where we are and lord help me to the uh uh today if we can get into it your clicker is acting up but we're gonna get there praise be the name of the lord okay brother bonham says that this great first battle that was ever thought beginning in water when michael and his angel fought against lucifer and his angel the bible just said that hell was created for the devil and his angel ever clear so when we say the devil the devil and his angel he means something amen what about him say when michael and his angel fought against lucifer and who his angel it first started the first body was in heaven so sin did not originate on earth he originated in water so whatever happened on earth here is only a reflection of the star war do you think they put up that movie by any chance they understood certain things better than you because the children of darkness are wiser than the children of light ever here the true star war speak about the true origin ever clear ever clear so far and then after this battle happened then he was thrown down from heaven cast out of heaven to the water and fell on water so before something happened in the nature it must happen into another dimension amen before esau and jacob fight in the belly of the mother remember on wednesday they have to fight from somewhere everybody created so far blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah let me see i wish that computer can come to the front but that's fine in revelation 12 the bible says there was war in heaven michael and water his angel fought against the dragon and the dragon fought with his water to kingdom and prevailed not neither was there their position found anymore in water so they had a position before but they lost their position and the great dragon was cast out that old serpent called the devil and satan which deceived the whole world he was cast out into the water and his angels were cast out with him so lucifer never came down himself he came down with his company cola was never destroyed himself cola went down with his company ever clear so far so in short from there that election doesn't really start here elections start way up there into the star the bible says forsake a church thee before god and the lord jesus christ and the water so they are certain angel they were elected and some of them were not elected whoever was elected stood with michael and michael was crashed and whoever was not elected stood with the devil depending on their origin everybody clear so far blessed be the name of the lord so you started from somewhere else here what you are brother branham say i said it in the beginning what you are somewhere else is what you reflect here remember on wednesday the baby when he's in the belly he's not there it's just the muscles that are moving but in the pregnancy of rebecca the muscles were punching each other [Music] but if you look there the individuals are not there they are somewhere else so where was the fight what you are watch your water oh terrace your body is up yonder watch your celestial body somewhere else is what you are reflecting back here in the spirit land what you are is what you are here if you are still full commanded and so forth in the spirit land you are vulgar-minded here if you still got malice envy and strife you are in the spirit land with that you reflect back here but if your whole innermost being has become cleansed and purge it shows that you got a body out beyond wedding that has been cleansed and purged and it's reacting back into water so the fight between eso and jacob was not really a natural fight it was a fight that started somewhere into a different realm ever clear so far blessed be the name of the lord don't know if i need a battery brother if you got triple a you can let me know i have it in my bag but i didn't think this is going to act like this amen blessed be the name of the lord the blah blah he said paul was holding up there saying about the water the election of god said that he saw and jacob before either baby was born or anything god said that he knew them and he hated esau and loved her before either boy had the chance to express their gadget for he was god he is infinite and he if he is infinite he knowed every flea every fly every knot everything that ever be on the earth he knew it he's the infinite eternal immortal blessed god omnipotent you there on me present omnipresent you there and water remember that omission it's what makes god own me present you remember there is nothing that he doesn't know that is the reason he can tell what the end will be so the omniscient power of god give god the prophetic power because god knows everything god is able to prophesy it is the omniscient or the knowledge of god that give god the prophetic power everybody here he knows the end from the beginning what is prophetic is just his water he is the chief attorney he is the judge he just picked the lawyer some of his wisdom that is what prophecy is that can foretell because he knows what he's going to be now there is god that we serve in other words the omniscient power of god makes god a prophet god can prophesy because he knows everything about here but before these two children were born before they were even formed in the mother womb god spoke god saw them where did god see them anybody clear so far now let's go to genesis chapter 25 now as we're getting into this we're going to pull esau and jacob amen verse 20. this is where we were on wednesday the bible says and isaac was 40 years why 40. 40 years old when he took rebecca as his as a wife the daughter of beethoven the syrian of pentanom the sister of laban the syrian everybody clear and isaac treated the lord for his wife because she was barren and the lord was intrigued of him and rebecca his wife did water we know rebecca conceived by one remember on wednesday the serpent said not by two everybody clear so this story move us from the earth back to heaven everybody clear verse 22 and the children struggle together inside of her the muscles and she said if it be so why am i does and she went to inquire of the lord who went to god was isaac there keep your seat belt who went to god again rebecca went to god the bible is not speaking anything about isaac to ask about the fight i am one field i have it seems like i have twins in my field but for some reason they're not quiet they are fighting one is always fighting against the other are they from the same source or not are we there so god you the one that gave me this pregnancy who gave the children anybody clear because she was barren so if god gave me the children i'm going to go back to god to ask him why is my child behaving the way he behaves everybody here so when she went back to god god now broke the seal what is god saying if you can give me a minute let me see if that's gonna help here the devil knows why he's upset i know exactly what is in this slide and i know what he's going to do to him thank you brother caleb okay let's see if this is going to work okay wow i wish i had this quicker let me get him now amen so she went to god and inquired of god now god is giving the explanation verse 22 23 and the lord said to her how many nations are there two nations are in your womb and two manners of people shall be separated from the obama and the one people shall be stronger than the other people usually when we say one people shall be stronger than the other who do you think we give that strength to is so right so normally we say esau was the strongest one day jacob fight he fought with god [Music] and jacob behold god he held god all the way till the morning and god was not able to even leave jacob anybody here until god have to destabilize about i mean jacob to kind of quiet him down everybody and then he changed the name of jacob from jacob to israel because jacob of the kem god that's right everybody here so who was the stronger one you need a scripture go to the book of hosea so jacob was the stronger one you need the scripture see me you okay now okay let's go back so the the younger uh the one people shall be stronger than the other people and the elder shall serve the who normally the younger is the one who's gonna serve there by birth by birth by nature by this world the one that came first was esau everybody here now in the mind of god god was eternal god never had a beginning god never had an end everything that was in god or his attribute we demonstrated to you that they were what eternal everybody clear so we always existed in the mind of god it is the kingdom of the devil and the children of the devil that had a beginning and the end so who was really the true elder who always existed in the mind of god was he jacob or esau jacob was the elder in the star we okay now is everybody okay i'm going slowly i know i'm dodging that steroid in the star everybody clear hey but naturally speaking the elder is who is esau anybody here so now you understand when jacob was fighting you okay now he understood that his son was pulling his position that's why jacob was fighting he was fighting and fighting ever here he was fighting trying to hold his position everybody here usually when twins are born one will be born first and it's gonna take a while before the second one is born here but in jacob and issa as soon as israel is coming out they found jacob is holding his anchor and keep going everybody here you can't go out there i am the one who hold the position everybody here they behave behavior of jacob was interpreted by the people of the world as a deceiver amen jacob was judged by the people that he is a bad character [Music] anybody clear they saw him that he's a fighter he's a man that doesn't have respect nature saw him as a deceiver everybody here the only one that knew the truth about jacob was only rebecca everybody understanding so when you look at jacob you're going to judge him bad you're going to judge him by his behavior and nobody understood why jacob always was unsatisfied to be the youngest [Music] come on you follow me until he was seeking for every opportunity that he can gain his position back and when he found out that his soul came from the field and esau was tired and eso begin to ask him something jacob turned around and said yes before i give it to you give me the birthright what was in this boy that he loved the birthright so much what was in this boy that he always wanna be first let's go now to the scripture verse 24 and when the days to be delivered where fulfilled behold they were what twins needed naturally speaking by two twins here by one anybody here in the womb now they first came out how red all over like water when iso came iso came like a hairy garment anybody care so when you look at each song human beings are not born we fell out of here i'm going slowly everybody here what comes out with hair all over from the womb is usually animal are we okay until to deceive isaac they have to get a good skin have you seen a god have you skinned the goat of the skin of a god you have to get that too much esau ever here am i reading a different bible so when you take a goat and if you sleeping on your bed and somebody bring a goat and you touch him and they move the god and they bring israel you touch him you won't make any difference am i reading a different bible so each soul display a beastly nature everybody here so far anybody can everybody clear so far and they're calling me so verse 26 and after that came his brother out and his hand took a hold of israel's heel and his name was called jacob and isaac was harmony to score his water 16. he was 40 when he got married and he got his children when he was 60. the difference is how many years 20 years so then they lived 20 years without any problem until he so came because pentecost was in 33 and the church of ephesus started in 53 and 33 man is 53 it's 20 years of pure church before the denominational spirit was introduced everybody clear so far did that lose anybody did i lose anybody can i start it again can i start again esau was 40 years he lived 40 years with rebecca without any problem because i mean uh isaac was 40 years he lived 20 years with rebecca without any problem there was no wrong seed in the camp of isaac after 20 years a wrong seed is born by esau and in the day of pentecost the holy ghost came in 33 after jesus christ and brother branham said the ephesian church started in 1953 so it took 20 years without the church was quiet without any problem and in 53 the nicolet and spirit begin to operate within the churches okay now i'm using a different caliber sorry everybody clear ever here are you twenty three score years old when she was born when she bought them everybody clear job now in verse 27 and the boys grew and he saw was the water like nimble road [Music] you okay now okay county hunters like nimrod a man of the water a man of the world he's always out he can stay tame amen because over there he can find creatures that have hair like him at home they look a little bit different when he's going everybody's looking at him everybody here and jacob was a water a plain simple man dwelling into water want to stay with mama with the church all the time okay brother mike you want to say in the church all the time what around it he doesn't want to go out there hallelujah verse 28 put your seat belt here and isaac loved esau can i erase this who loved esau and isaac did what he loved esau watch kama he loved issa because he did eat of his water the love of esau was a conditional love everybody here the love of esau was based on work [Music] the love of esau was based on interest or advantage anybody care about here so jacob isaac love is so for a reason ever here because he saw do work he saw bring a zebra home tomorrow he brings an antelope tomorrow he brings a baby elephant tomorrow he's always working working working working working working ever here did isaac had the revelation of jacob who had the revelation of jacob who let's read the bible again and isaac loved israel because he did eat of his venison but who rebecca loved jacob because did you see it because so the love of rebecca is an unconditional love [Applause] if you ask isaac why do you love his soul oh he brings us good meat if you ask rebecca i don't know i just love this boy everybody here this love of esau is a filial love the love of rebecca is a gap here love everybody clear so far the love of rebecca have a root on the success [Music] in other words rebecca loved by faith all by revelation is everybody okay did i lose anybody but the love of isaac was based on the five senses everybody here the first one is c what is the second one taste what is the third one smell what is the fourth one here what is the other one touch prove me that brother stephen go to genesis chapter 27 hallelujah are you there keep your seat belt if you're tired you raise again we okay let's go to genesis 27 and it came to pass that when isaac was water and his water which senses was there check why did god blinded this i'm going slowly i'm going slowly we okay you're gonna see his man or his eyes were dim so that he could not water about here let me drop this here he called who he saw his eldest son by nature and said to him now let me stop here at this point esau already sold his birthright was as aware of it he's still working by nature we okay now and said to him my son and he said to him behold here i am and he said behold now i am old and not know the day of my death now therefore take i pray you your water your water your weapons come out your quiver and your water you see why that nicolette and spirit has a ball we okay and your bow and go out into the water and take me some water the blessings of esau was based on work the blessing of esau was best of work you must work to get blessed [Music] we okay now so we just see there everybody here so far job to verse 4 and make me a water what does it mean so esau must satisfy the test of isaac i'm going with the five senses we okay now hallelujah job to verse 21 and as it said to jacob jacob is coming to deceive him come near i pray you that i may work that i may whatever which says for esau to get the blessing they must make sure it's him they must rob him that's my son that's it so they must touch him everybody here i pray you that i may feel you my son whether you be my very son who or it's based on a touch verse 22. and jacob went near to near to isaac his father and he felt him and say the water watch which says is that one they need to hear the voice which sense is left today job to verse 27. are you there somebody scream right somebody scream right am i reading a different bible at the opening of the seal the bible became anew verse 27 and he came near and kissed him and did water smell the smell of water so for israel to get this blessing he must satisfy water so by nature jacob have no chances by nature jacob was unqualified i'm qualified for the blessing which blessing the blessing of abraham that came on isaac but jacob somebody took his breath right he's trying to get back to his blessing based on his origin but he is blocked [Applause] hallelujah let's see amazing grace my friend great my friend amazing grace my friend amazing very much we didn't qualify but we gonna make it hallelujah church i'm helping you to take your hand off looking at yourself don't look at yourself anymore look at who's there look at the predestinated seed that's gonna determine your blessings hallelujah all i need to know is where i come from that's all the rest god will do it it's our grace it's our grace brother micah you don't have to boast it is a grace he's just giving up to you based on where you come from [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah the people of this world thought you are not a message believer you didn't understand the message but something in you keep holding something keep moving something keep moving because you are predestinated for this [Applause] hallelujah you want to see what god did you want to see what god did [Music] oh my my my my what did god do what did god do hallelujah your eye is the gate to your water you can look at it and it almost worked govern the water you understand why god blinded isaac you understand why god branded isaac because as long as i succeed isaac can tell that this is not jesus he can tell that this is jacob this is his soul because his love is based on the senses so god blinded himself amen are you there you look at it before you do it you look at it before you do what and what and so forth it's usually the eye that is the gate to the soul [Music] jesus said the light of the body is the water if therefore then i'll be single that whole body is full of water so god turned the light off and in his seer and so forth absolutely knows that these things as god will reveal it there is many things he don't reveal to his water so god not only dem isaac he turned off his prophetic office he is god he can do whatever he wants [Music] hallelujah look at jacob sitting on a stone sitting up there and brought his his boy's coat and no he was a prophet brought his coat back and said a beast to kill your boy that was wrong he didn't know the difference for 40 years they lied to jacob joseph was killed the prophetic office was turned off look at who sitting there setting up their tone of water and he come and here come up jacob said i am esau he blessed him for who a prophet so god turned the eyes off you understand you understand and he takes also the prophetic office and turn it off [Music] everybody there who heard the revelation of jacob let's go to genesis 27 [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah go to verse 5 and rebecca heard so you can understand now why sea was destroyed they keep the other one but the problem is here the what because isaac said you need to cook for me the way i like it ever here so his son knew how to cook and jacob knew how to cook who can match the cooking of rebecca who's the wife of isaac [Music] who really know the test of isaac he saw rebecca verse 5 and rebecca heard when isaac spoke to who he saw his son and he so went to the field to hunt for a venison i'm gonna prove daddy i'm gonna show him again i can do it my back here and to bring it and rebecca spoke to her her son saying behold i heard your father speak to esau your brother saying bring me a venison and make me sovereign that i may eat and bless you before the lord before the lord before my death now therefore my son obey my brother michael gathered the voice of rebecca obey my voice according to which i do what they command of rebecca to esau go to the field go work and in the field it's uncertain you got a chase you got to get in the field you can get right here the beast can be right here maybe the beast might be two miles maybe the beast might be 20 miles you have to keep searching searching searching searching searching so it might take you three four hours watch jacob you there verse nine go now to the water let him work hey turn here why didn't you check why did he die second tell esau go to the flock kill it bring it to me so that i made it bring me the fruit of your label right back to jacob i don't want you to work boy turn on the backyard here just bring me the goat did jacob sweat for it did you take up work for it amazing grace [Applause] are you there go now to the flock and bring from there who to good kids of goat and i will make them when they shall hunt two hours tired he have to come and skim the animal and he have to clean the animal and he has to cook and cook to the taste of the father but jacob bring me the animal go sit down i will kill the animal i will skim it i am the one cooking you just go what were you doing watching cartoon continue watching cartoons [Music] hallelujah and i will make them suffering meat for your father such as him another secret this boy is going to try left to right and no you put one two three game over here and you shall bring it to your father that he may eat that he may bless you before his death and jacob said to rebecca his mother behold he saw my brother he's a hairy man and i am smooth my father perhaps will do water he's a filial man and i shall see and i shall seem to him as a water did jacob want to lie why do you call him a lion why do you ever call him a liar change it from today are you there and i shall bring a curse upon me and not a blessing and his mother said to him upon who be [Music] you see sister rosemary moving this way [Music] are you there are you there the good rebecca the beautiful example of marriage the holy rebecca became to play the part of a sinner [Music] she accepted to take the curse because curse is who who is hang on the tree so rebecca become crushed for isaac let me take the curse let me become sinner so that you can become [Music] [Applause] i have one objective i have the revelation i know who you are nature brought your brother before but i have the revelation before the foundation of the world you are there the birthright belongs to you i'm gonna be cursed so that you can get your blessings that belong to you [Applause] [Music] hallelujah we still have a problem we still have a problem you can fool him with a test rebecca cook you can fool him with a touch because they put two two goats if you notice there were two goats because in the old testament there were two goats that were going the scapegoat [Music] are you there so they have to kill the god and cover jacob with the goat are you there so you can fool here you can fool with the smell do you know why jump to verse 27 verse 15. are you there and rebecca took goodly water of her elder who which where with who hair in their house and put them upon whom so we can deal with smell we can deal with touch we can deal with tests we have a problem with hearing try try if so usually is daddy try adi try again try again daddy it's not working what can we do jump to verse 21 22 job to verse 22 and jacob went near to isaac his father and he felt him which quote the court of israel and say their voice is who but the hands at the hands of who like a goat jacob trembling his father touched the voice is jacob jacob say i i i would that's what i was telling mama i told mama i told mama no mama didn't hear me are you there watch what god turned off you ready you ready verse 23 and he glory when isaac begin to try to get under the anointing god said the angel turn that off turn that off quickly the angel went there peep if you are struggling let me help you who was blessing was it isaac or god do you think you can cheat god [Music] now it's clear right now it's okay because somebody might be struggling it is not isaac giving the blessing amen he knew the whole story for the beginning he could have turned and say jacob struck dead but instead he's turning his prophet off are you there and he discerned him not because his hand were water he rely on the five cents to keep relying on the five senses you don't have the revelation and as his brother he shows hand so he did water how did you bless him verse 27 are you there hallelujah no job to verse 29 i'm going to skip let people do water and the nation do water be load over your and let your mother sun burn down to you curse be everyone that you want and blessed be he that dewater the blessing of abraham through the cross is transferred from the first son the jew naturally speaking and it's going toward the gender by the crossing of the hand [Applause] are you there are you there bring the two son the elder is here the youngest is here jacob brown no that is like this that is like this it is not me are you there so god turn this discernment off because jacob didn't have a chance but jacob was the one rightfully the one who should get it where are we going to my god my god amen our eternal destination is not altogether determined by what we see which senses did they turn off and what we do what which senses did they turn off why god touches those two the other one no problem but it's determined on what what do you see what god was turning them off what we have we have of what we see and what we the message is perfectly in line with the scripture everybody why what shall we say then that the gender which follow not after righteousness have attend to righteousness even the righteousness which is of water based on revelation jacob unqualified jacob got the blessing and he who worked hard lost the blessing what can we say then amen but israel which follow after the water has not attended wherefore because they sought it not by water zero revelation but as we were by water i'm gonna go bring another one i'm gonna work daddy i'm gonna show daddy prove to him you searches by work the other one revelation it is not him something in him keep pressing the buff right the birthright the buff right the bethra the baphora who told him you need the birthright [Music] by revelation for the stumble and that stamping block everybody so far let me see if i can head a little bit more so now lest there be any fornicator or profane person doesn't know the value of stuff as who who for one more cell of meat sold his birthright are you there knowing this that their law is not made for a righteous man but for the water and disobedient and ungodly and sinner for unholy and who that belongs to esau israel searched by force they missed it they missed god they never understood what happened ever here let's head now to the airport you ready tighten up first peter chapter 3 for christ also has once suffered for sin the just for the unjust that he might bring us to whom being put to death in the flesh but quickened by the spirit why are human going to hell by which he jesus christ went and preached unto the waters the spirit in water according to first peter 3 these men in hell they were water everybody clear hallelujah which sometimes specifications were disobedient when was the long suffering of god whether in the days of what so man spirit now in hell in the days of who peter chapter 2 if god spared not the water duh which angel but cast them into water and deliver them into chains of darkness to be reserved unto judgment and spare not the old water but save who so this engine was from which timer over here they call them water over here they are called water you understand now hell was created for the devil and he is here the lord knows how to saving lamb the godly out of temptation and reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be what the lion rough we okay now tighten up because i'm gonna zeroed in you ready lord help me hallelujah all right bro upon him interpret that scripture for if god spared not who how is that angel spell leader a the spirit that were in prison that repented not in the long suffering of the days of who same angel but brother put the two together he was who who [Music] do you understand why the rich young ruler a preacher and evangelist want to help [Music] are you there absolutely angel is a messenger he goes down he's saying the lexicon if he spared not for god if god spared not the angel that sin the water remember on wednesday okay but stephen where are we going now lord help me hallelujah wow praise god all right now if you notice in the same question if you notice one does what where where we're back again in heaven over in revelation the 12th chapter and the right juggle remember scripture stood to divide the child as soon as he was born and he took his tail and pulled a third of the stars of heaven and cast them to thee did you notice that that doesn't mean that satan has a long tail that he hooked around people by the water the story that he and pull out a third part of the store those stairs wear water [Music] are we okay now are we okay now so what happened in the days of noah truly happen oh abraham say oh abraham said oh god told abraham look up to water and number there if you can he say i can't do it he said neither were you able to number to number your seed duh who is the bright and morning you remember that jesus of nazareth the brothers die ever lived in human flesh he is the bride and the morning water and the children of god are morning water hey oh my god god help me i'm zero evening come on there we go neither because they are the seed of abraham are they all water in other words not all stars are children of god don't go watch it are you there but in who shall deceiver they which are the children of the these are not the children of god but the children of them are accounted for and that promise was christ hallelujah your clicker is taking my second so the stars of heaven represented the spirit of who we okay now we okay now watch now as we drop it when the red dragon roam under persecution i get turned off the star every scripture has a compound meaning but the obama is going up down he begin to show you from noah in the time of jesus the story keeps repeating so all over satan is keep pulling his stars and god is pulling also his stars all over the story is repeating everybody is pulling their own children every age the children of god the children of the devil the children of god the children of the devil here at the crucifixion of our lord jesus when they rejected him cast him down and had nothing to do there was the third part of the angelic the angelic so they were a human being brother branham now is showing here that when the jews were rejecting christ on the earth it is nothing but a manifestation of what already happened a long time hallelujah inside of you is a spirit another man the outside of you is one man the inside of you is another man so the inside of you is the supernatural the spirit the angel the outside of you is the physical and this being if you are spirit led by god you become a messenger of god or an angel god's messenger god's angel is the very same word can separate it god's messenger or god's water so we found out that what happened in the natural is nothing else but a reflection of something that happened way up there ever clear hallelujah what is going on the souls that were in prison that repented not were not angelic beings that had been brought down in the form of angel angels means human being means theophany means angel brother branham said it is not the angels like gabriel and uh and wormwood that's not it that's not those angels those angels are not what we're talking about here that's what brother branham is he's saying here but he was the spirit of those angelic water they are human beings that fell before the foundation of the water back there one day went on water your star war everybody here and lucifer was cast out down with all his water brother branham is no longer saying angel his children all of them you understand now remember matthew 13 the tales and the witter the children that he deceived he had deceived and those angels came down to the earth and was subject to them to become water and when they did it the sons of god they used to be saw the daughter of water they were the children of the devil you okay so the devil was cast down watch this before i go hey did you give me grace with this clicker oh my all righty maybe it's coming up praise god they are sons of god every man that is born in this earth is a son of god regardless whether he's a sinner or he's or what is he or what he is he is the son of god created in the image of god for god for the praise of god he's created that way but god in the beginning knew would receive him and who would not receive him therefore he could do whatever or not we okay now but by four knowledge he could tell who will be what and who will not be what for he knew which person would take up witches and those spirit that came from the throne of god and stand before the throne of god billions and billions alien of time before the world ever begin in the presence of god do you think they don't know something about worship that's why korah can serve god a certain time and after time he's gonna fall that's why judah can serve a certain time and after a while he's gonna fall because in heaven they serve a certain time and after that time they fell it is just a manifestation of a movie [Music] i'm gonna finish hang tight are you there absolutely they worship god and they have the knowledge of god they are ensured and educated always but god rejected them from the water that's why god said i hated esau because god saw what is so deed in heaven before he saw us [Music] are you there are you there are you there let me zero into the airport give me grace it's my clicker acting up today amen so the devil who was created changed from lucifer into satan because he rebelled against god are you there he created war and the people recruit around him just like the people recruit around korra that's right are you there and god in morphine to michael and then fight him amen so we were fighting the devil in heaven [Music] mark 16 mark 16 started in heaven the casting of devils started in heaven [Applause] are you there so this creature that used to serve god are you there god open up created hell as a prison house you okay now and took everybody that belongs to the devil and god took all of them pulled all of them together and brought them all into hell are you there oh my this clicker he took all of them into hell are you there all of them god pulled them into hell now this is not the this is not in the world this is before the foundation of the world ever here that's the true star war when they were overcome god sent them into a prison and now when they were into a prison now all of them became a resident of hell you okay and they become sons of water at the beginning they were sons of god [Music] are you there now when a woman is pregnant not you are you there depending on what god want to do he pulled one up if it's twins he put it and he pulled one from down and he put it so when he saw and jacob found himself navigating around rebecca the fight started [Music] now the children begin to fight rebecca doesn't understand no the two spirits are going in one womb now they begin to fight one is coming from a different origin that's why jesus taught the pharisee you are from you are from beneath i came from water are you there because judah was a son of water when he was coming god look he said no jesus is coming okay jesus who is his match judah judah he pull him come get in here and mama got to judah are you there if that's why he came a son of water he's coming from down here so not only is the those angels fell the third of the other angel also fell together everybody so now they change from true angel they become demona they were not demons before amen when they become demon god precipitated them all over there they become children of what rough everybody and then everyone that is represented in hell his destination will be destroyed at the lake of fire because all of them were not eternal god is using them as tools when he finished he recruit all of them he take him to the lake of fire which is the second death and wipe them again all over and we remain without trouble are you there are you there are you there blessed be the name of the lord but unto the ones that are eternal brother brother say they are the angels and god and the spirit that is joined with god is one spirit now the spirit of god that dwells in the church is the spirit that comes from heaven and god knew before the foundation of the word that rejected the water so you didn't resist the devil here you rejected the devil when you were in heaven are you there that's why sometimes you don't understand but something and you say i don't believe him i don't believe him i don't believe him because you already rejected him over there [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah and that spirit had to take a body of flesh to take his water that's why you're here you're taking the testing he had to come to flesh like the other did and all of them put on nico yolk esau and jacob but god knows who is he so who is jacob and god by the beginning knows the spirit that would and which would not there you are that devil is so wise he can just deceive the very elected amen amen okay let me finish here blessed be the name of the lord wow come on let me finish here your clicker is not working okay brother branham says this brother brother says this he say i don't believe that a person just happened to be here by chance no just think when you come to the world everything had to be [Music] i'm landing the ship [Music] okay all water rather for who i don't hardly understand that how we could think that a god a god that could prepare all these good things for us we could not put trust in him [Music] if he brought us in this chaos that we are in our in now and prepared the good things of life for us here how much more can we trust in him to prepare the things that is to come [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah look how your earthly parent before you come here before they know you was coming made ready for your coming just think of that now your earthly parent which an earthly parent is only a type of a heavenly parent if we know how to give good gift to our children how much more does your heavenly father knows how to give good water to his water they made ready for your coming they made a little crib and got a little booties leader clothes and so forth they made ready everything for you to water prepare before you even come to the water before you were coming into the earth daddy and mommy even made a baby shower for you they prepare everything before you come in that preparation also happened in heaven that's why the lamb was slain before the foundation of the world before you come in this world god already prepared so all things all things work together for your goodness no matter what is going on no matter what happens no matter the circumstances god is in control let's stand up [Applause] [Applause] [Music] hallelujah you don't belong to the devil hallelujah you're not god you're not the devil's property the devil have nothing to do with you we belong to god and mother fact we fought him in heaven we resisted him in heaven we stood for the message of the hour in heaven that's why we are standing here are you there whether i understand it or not this love is unconditional it is a gap alone i don't have to work for it somebody prepare everything your road is already pre-planned your words please the lord because god put faith in you before even you know it why you were yet sinner christ died for who hallelujah church take your hand off your life hallelujah all you need to do is connect back to your maker connect back to god make sure your relationship with god is clean and you take your hand off and god himself is gonna drop things left and right left and right left you don't have to do anything you need a marriage god have your marriage up there are you there many people come and talk to you it didn't work some you even thought it's gonna work it didn't work because god have somebody for you you need a job god already prepared the job hallelujah hallelujah i skip it but i will show you even that when before you were you were born when you were coming out of god god was putting even your career into you [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah not everybody is going to be a doctor hallelujah you bring somebody defend you bring somebody else and you see they're doing things you can give somebody this building and he's going to do things and you wonder how does he know it he did it the school is only programming him but truly he doesn't even need that school he was already in him that's why paul said one star died fair from another star in water in glory because when we were coming god was looking god wanted to be a carpenter hallelujah but he could not do everything because he's going to come in the man jesus christ so god begin to look at that tribute he said what am i going to do what am i going to do what am i going to do i want to work in a milk company how can i work in a milk company you know what who's this one it's kalimba milk get out [Applause] and do you know what happened brother kalima was pushed toward medical school but it didn't work because god had something else for him and once you find your position you're gonna feel like you don't work too hard anymore [Applause] you will see some people going to work upset some are ready to go to work they even ready to go to their job they spend even more time in their job than their work that was what they created him for lord willing maybe in the future i will show you when god was speaking you he was picking your your profession you were coming with a package so god wanted to be a king he look he said what i'm gonna david get it to be in egypt who is here moses who joseph who else who get that's why brother branham said he was crushed in moses he was crushed in mon he was crushed in with christ working in a track job it is christ working as a doctor it is christ working in a bread company all of them it is jesus christ he wanted to work on those facilities [Music] [Applause] let's pray heavenly father lord once again we thank you for your grace for your love and your mercy and father for everything that you are doing for us lord now that you are
