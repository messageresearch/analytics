[52:44] brother hamilton and cesar keller
[52:47] for opening the door it was tremendously
[52:51] a great blessing and a good anointing
[52:53] amen
[52:54] so let's go to our scripture this
[52:56] morning as you're standing
[52:59] be the name of the lord
[53:03] your boss
[53:05] or our boss
[53:09] to give me a different direction
[53:12] it's still
[53:15] connected or linked
[53:17] to the theme we're working on
[53:19] but it's just like a little parenthesis
[53:23] that
[53:24] we're going to go through
[53:25] and then come back again and keep moving
[53:28] amen so in other words we exit a little
[53:31] bit by way biking by we going back again
[53:33] to the highway you know 85 exit you go
[53:36] right up in the ramp and you can go back
[53:38] up again and get on amen so we just
[53:41] arrived at the ramp and before you know
[53:42] it we go back up again
[53:44] amen
[53:46] blessed be the name of the lord let's go
[53:48] to genesis chapter 13.
[53:52] it is not me it is your boss
[53:55] the bible called him the great shepherd
[53:59] so i'm just a shepherd under him
[54:03] so i must follow his instruction
[54:06] amen
[54:07] genesis chapter 13
[54:12] if you're there you can say amen
[54:16] verse 5 very familiar scripture
[54:20] for those who read their bible
[54:24] and lot
[54:25] also
[54:26] which went with abraham abraham
[54:30] had flock
[54:32] and herds
[54:34] and tent
[54:38] and the land was not able to bear them
[54:41] that they might dwell together
[54:44] for their substance
[54:46] was great
[54:48] so that they could not dwell
[54:50] together so abraham has his substance
[54:54] flocked
[54:55] heard
[54:56] cuddle and lot have flocks heard cuddle
[55:00] now it was so
[55:02] great
[55:03] until the land
[55:04] could not provide for both
[55:07] so a separation must happen
[55:13] you might be seated
[55:16] verse 7 and there was a strife
[55:20] between the herdsmen of abram's cattle
[55:24] so the problem was based on cattle
[55:28] they heard their cattle
[55:31] anybody clear
[55:33] that's where this trough start
[55:36] amen
[55:38] so probably this one say we're going to
[55:39] be using this part here we will feed our
[55:42] cattle somebody said no that belonged to
[55:44] us and then before you know it the
[55:46] cattle the caddo razor the caddo
[55:50] razor start the strap the problem
[55:53] started here
[55:56] amen
[55:57] and there was a strap between the
[55:59] herdsmen of abraham's cattle and the
[56:02] herdsmen of lord's cattle
[56:05] and the canaanite and the parasite
[56:08] dwelt then in the land
[56:12] and abram say to lot
[56:14] let there be no strife i pray you
[56:17] between me and you
[56:19] and between my hurts man and your hurts
[56:22] man
[56:22] for we be
[56:24] brethren we're related we don't want to
[56:26] trouble
[56:27] is not the whole land before you
[56:31] do water
[56:35] okay
[56:36] separate yourself i pray you from me
[56:39] if you will take
[56:41] the left hand
[56:42] then i will go to the right
[56:44] or if you depart to the right hand
[56:48] then i will go to the left
[56:50] so the choice
[56:52] was given to lot
[56:55] just as much as to abraham amen
[57:00] the free will
[57:03] if you were not there yesterday
[57:05] you won't understand what we're talking
[57:07] about the free will was given to both of
[57:11] abraham
[57:13] had to take the second choice
[57:18] in other words if lord choose right
[57:23] then abraham is in trouble
[57:27] because abraham never said if you go to
[57:30] the right i'm going to go to the left no
[57:32] abraham gave lord both the right
[57:35] and the left
[57:36] but one was right
[57:39] and one side was wrong
[57:42] and if lord
[57:43] choose the right path
[57:45] then abraham is going to fall on the
[57:48] wrong slot
[57:51] but abraham was not afraid
[57:58] he gave both choices
[58:02] [Music]
[58:03] and the choice
[58:05] was based upon what was in the heart
[58:12] where are you going
[58:15] the place you're going to live
[58:17] the church you are going to
[58:20] it's only an expression of what is in
[58:23] your heart
[58:29] hallelujah
[58:31] amen
[58:32] verse 10
[58:33] and lord lift up his eyes
[58:37] and beheld all the plant of water
[58:42] jordan jordan river
[58:45] the plan of jordan
[58:47] in other words the valley of jordan amen
[58:52] jordan when you go to israel
[58:56] jordan started from the north
[58:59] then he get
[59:02] into what they call the sea of galilee
[59:07] america
[59:08] then he continues all the way
[59:12] and
[59:12] he ends on the dead sea
[59:17] on the dead sea
[59:19] ever clear
[59:21] so
[59:22] when you look at the map like this
[59:25] the promised land was on this side this
[59:28] is the promised land
[59:31] everybody clear
[59:33] so israel leaving egypt should go
[59:35] straight this way
[59:37] and go to the promised land
[59:39] but israel wasted time
[59:41] and went around this way
[59:44] so the direction of the jews they were
[59:46] coming this way
[59:48] about here
[59:49] and they came from this side
[59:51] so this is east
[59:55] and the promised land was on the west
[59:59] based on jordan
[1:00:03] you need that
[1:00:04] amen
[1:00:06] so lord lift up his eyes
[1:00:09] and beheld all the plane of jordan
[1:00:12] that
[1:00:13] the valley of jordan
[1:00:15] so we on that side there
[1:00:18] the valley or the plain of jordan that
[1:00:20] it was well
[1:00:22] water everywhere
[1:00:25] when you look it's a very fertile land
[1:00:29] and that fertility comes from the river
[1:00:33] jordan
[1:00:34] very fertile well water everywhere amen
[1:00:39] everywhere
[1:00:40] praise be the name of the lord
[1:00:43] before the lord destroyed sodom
[1:00:46] and gomorrah
[1:00:48] even as the garden of water
[1:00:52] so that land that was close to jordan
[1:00:55] look like a garden of eden
[1:01:01] that's where a lot look
[1:01:03] amen
[1:01:05] like the land of egypt
[1:01:09] as you come to water
[1:01:12] the garden of eden looked like the land
[1:01:15] of egypt where the jews came out
[1:01:19] because abraham was in egypt
[1:01:23] amen we float
[1:01:25] and they came out of egypt and they
[1:01:27] dwell into the south america
[1:01:30] so the land a lot looked at that at
[1:01:34] was the land that resembled the land of
[1:01:37] egypt it was a fertility
[1:01:41] or a blessing
[1:01:44] that
[1:01:45] looks like the land of egypt
[1:01:49] a blessing that looked like the world
[1:01:55] [Music]
[1:01:57] yet he look also like the garden of eden
[1:02:03] he looked like the garden of eden
[1:02:07] and he also looked like egypt
[1:02:12] who made the garden of eden
[1:02:15] good
[1:02:17] and who built egypt
[1:02:22] the tree
[1:02:23] of good and evil
[1:02:28] we okay
[1:02:29] did i lose anybody
[1:02:31] okay let me go back again and lord lift
[1:02:34] up his eyes and beheld all the plan of
[1:02:37] jordan jordan means what
[1:02:42] we okay now
[1:02:44] okay the plan of death
[1:02:48] amen
[1:02:49] that he was well watered everywhere
[1:02:51] before the lord destroys sodom and
[1:02:54] gomorrah even as the garden of the lord
[1:02:57] like the land of egypt
[1:03:00] as you come to zorro
[1:03:03] then lord choose him or the plane of
[1:03:06] water
[1:03:08] so abraham
[1:03:09] is doomed
[1:03:10] to the other side
[1:03:13] and lord journey where
[1:03:17] do you say where east is
[1:03:19] the promised land was where
[1:03:22] make sense now
[1:03:24] and lord choose all the plains of jordan
[1:03:27] and lot journey east and they separated
[1:03:31] themselves
[1:03:32] the one from the other
[1:03:35] abram dwell in the land of water
[1:03:39] why didn't lord choose the promised land
[1:03:45] he had the choice
[1:03:46] why he didn't choose it
[1:03:50] abraham gave him the chance
[1:03:52] go ahead and choose it
[1:03:54] but he went the other way
[1:03:58] amen
[1:03:59] and abraham dwell in the land of canaan
[1:04:02] and lord dwell in the cities of the plan
[1:04:06] and pitch his tent toward water
[1:04:09] do you see where he took him
[1:04:11] it looks very good
[1:04:13] but it's a way towards sodom
[1:04:16] but the man of sodom where lot
[1:04:19] went
[1:04:20] looks very good
[1:04:22] a good opportunity
[1:04:24] great to prosper oh that's where i'm
[1:04:26] gonna go i have a lot of cattle that's
[1:04:29] that's a land i have a lot of water
[1:04:31] there is a lot of grass and i'm gonna
[1:04:33] take care of my substance
[1:04:35] but he never knew the man of sodom
[1:04:40] the men of sodom were wicked
[1:04:43] and sinners
[1:04:45] before the lord how
[1:04:48] abraham spared completely
[1:04:52] let's go to mark chapter 10.
[1:04:59] two options given
[1:05:01] lot
[1:05:02] has as much right to go to the promised
[1:05:05] land
[1:05:06] as abraham had
[1:05:09] but god knew
[1:05:11] where lot is going to go
[1:05:13] and abraham was not afraid
[1:05:15] like
[1:05:16] if i give him
[1:05:18] this way he might take the canaan land
[1:05:21] give it to him
[1:05:22] it depends on
[1:05:29] it depends on where you came from
[1:05:32] amen
[1:05:33] that will show up
[1:05:38] mark 10 verse 17. if you're there you
[1:05:40] can say amen
[1:05:42] very familiar scripture and when he was
[1:05:45] gone forth into the way
[1:05:48] there came one running
[1:05:50] somebody was under desperation
[1:05:54] indeed water
[1:05:56] nailed to him a humility
[1:06:00] finally i got here finally i was looking
[1:06:02] for him what are you looking for
[1:06:05] and ask him
[1:06:07] good master
[1:06:10] what shall i do
[1:06:11] that i may inherit
[1:06:14] eternal life
[1:06:16] finally i got the opportunity
[1:06:18] they told me he's going this way before
[1:06:21] he take his next flight let me rush and
[1:06:24] get him
[1:06:25] now i got him
[1:06:26] he's lord on the floor master
[1:06:30] i want eternal life do you really want
[1:06:32] it
[1:06:34] and jesus said to him
[1:06:36] why call you me good
[1:06:39] there is none good but who
[1:06:42] that is who
[1:06:44] deity
[1:06:47] so this man
[1:06:48] had a revelation of deity
[1:06:52] you know the commandment
[1:06:54] do not commit adultery do not kill
[1:06:57] do not steal
[1:06:59] do not bear false wiltness
[1:07:01] defraud not honor your father and mother
[1:07:05] and he answer and say to him master
[1:07:08] all these have i observed from my
[1:07:12] water is it a bad person
[1:07:18] very good fellow
[1:07:20] amen
[1:07:22] so when you look at him he qualified
[1:07:25] for eternal life
[1:07:27] never smoke
[1:07:29] never went to the nightclub
[1:07:31] never done something wrong
[1:07:33] you can tell him story about your life
[1:07:36] before
[1:07:37] you you were converted he doesn't have
[1:07:40] any clue
[1:07:43] he grew up a good boy
[1:07:47] he even recognized jesus to be a good
[1:07:49] master
[1:07:51] and when he approached him he's nailed
[1:07:53] down
[1:07:55] you say oh my god this one is a
[1:07:58] candidate to eternal life
[1:08:01] [Music]
[1:08:04] amen
[1:08:06] jesus put him to test
[1:08:08] this is the word this is the word this
[1:08:09] is the word everything you're telling me
[1:08:12] is just a routine
[1:08:14] that has been my life all over
[1:08:18] jesus
[1:08:20] give him the seal
[1:08:22] pull the seal and pulled your
[1:08:25] approval
[1:08:26] he already qualified
[1:08:28] jesus said wait a minute you're too
[1:08:30] quick
[1:08:31] let me check something really
[1:08:34] amen
[1:08:36] amen then jesus beholding him loved him
[1:08:41] by the word wow
[1:08:44] he saw
[1:08:46] very good worker
[1:08:48] the father loved him
[1:08:50] amen
[1:08:52] loved him
[1:08:54] and said to him
[1:08:55] one thing you like
[1:08:59] just one
[1:09:02] now it's changing
[1:09:03] he put the microscope
[1:09:05] and he pulls something
[1:09:08] one thing you like
[1:09:10] go your way
[1:09:12] sell whatsoever you have
[1:09:16] and give to the water
[1:09:19] and you shall have treasure in water
[1:09:23] heaven
[1:09:24] was given to this man
[1:09:30] eternal life was given to him
[1:09:35] so he cannot condemn god
[1:09:38] for not giving him
[1:09:40] the same opportunity he gave to
[1:09:42] everybody
[1:09:45] free will
[1:09:47] amen
[1:09:48] and you shall have treasure in heaven
[1:09:52] and come
[1:09:53] take up water
[1:09:55] and do whatever
[1:10:00] when jesus looked at him he loved him
[1:10:04] and jesus saw something in him
[1:10:08] that he wanted to use
[1:10:12] amen
[1:10:13] and he told him
[1:10:15] your cargo is too heavy
[1:10:20] take away your cargo
[1:10:22] there is something in you you don't know
[1:10:24] i'm gonna pick that
[1:10:26] and use it
[1:10:28] and the only way you can use it
[1:10:31] you must be in the correct place
[1:10:37] and follow me
[1:10:40] if you don't follow me
[1:10:42] you cannot use that
[1:10:45] i know i am the one who put it in you
[1:10:48] and the only way he can work properly
[1:10:51] you must follow me
[1:10:54] he wanted eternal life and continue his
[1:10:57] life back
[1:10:58] thank you i got eternal life god bless
[1:11:01] you we see you go back to my life jesus
[1:11:03] said
[1:11:04] when i give eternal life you cannot go
[1:11:07] back there
[1:11:08] you need to stick with me
[1:11:10] amen
[1:11:11] and from now on you gotta follow me
[1:11:14] if i go to the right you go to the right
[1:11:16] if i go to the left you go to the left
[1:11:19] where i sleep that's where you sleep
[1:11:21] where i die that's where you're gonna
[1:11:23] die
[1:11:28] he turned around he said my god all
[1:11:31] these prestige all my body all my friend
[1:11:35] i'm gonna leave it
[1:11:37] [Music]
[1:11:39] verse 22 and he was sad
[1:11:42] i thought he was looking for eternal
[1:11:44] life i thought he was running
[1:11:46] i thought he fell down
[1:11:48] he said good master good master i want
[1:11:52] eternal life
[1:11:53] this is eternal life
[1:11:56] now the conversation is sad
[1:12:01] what are you looking for
[1:12:04] what do you want
[1:12:06] what do you want from god
[1:12:10] do you really want a god
[1:12:13] do you really really really really want
[1:12:15] a god
[1:12:16] are you ready
[1:12:22] and he was sad
[1:12:23] at that saying
[1:12:25] and went away how
[1:12:27] [Music]
[1:12:31] eternal life is grieving you
[1:12:36] for he had water
[1:12:42] lot had water
[1:12:48] is somebody sleeping
[1:12:50] i can't preach to a quiet church
[1:12:55] lord
[1:12:57] had great possession
[1:13:03] and the rich young ruler
[1:13:05] had also water
[1:13:09] lot chose
[1:13:11] the land of sodom
[1:13:14] based on his possession
[1:13:18] not by revelation
[1:13:22] everybody clear
[1:13:24] verse 23
[1:13:26] and jesus look round about and say to
[1:13:29] his disciple
[1:13:31] how hardly in other words
[1:13:33] what a difficulty
[1:13:36] should they
[1:13:37] have water
[1:13:39] enter into the kingdom of water
[1:13:44] and the disciples were astonished at his
[1:13:47] words
[1:13:48] but jesus answered again and said to
[1:13:51] them
[1:13:52] children
[1:13:53] how hard
[1:13:55] is it
[1:13:57] for them
[1:13:58] duh
[1:14:00] trust in water
[1:14:03] so the heart really of the young man was
[1:14:07] not really on eternal life
[1:14:10] because where your treasure is
[1:14:13] that's where you are
[1:14:16] that trust enriches to enter into the
[1:14:19] kingdom of water
[1:14:21] the possession of this young man
[1:14:25] took him away from the promised land
[1:14:28] [Music]
[1:14:30] the possession of lot
[1:14:33] took him away from the promised land
[1:14:37] let's go to luke chapter 16.
[1:14:41] what i have i got to go slowly
[1:14:45] amen
[1:14:46] we only have one service
[1:14:49] we don't have two services
[1:14:52] if you have two services you're going to
[1:14:54] be
[1:14:55] murmuring probably some of you we got
[1:14:57] service again he took too long i can
[1:14:59] come back you don't have to come back
[1:15:01] you go home and he'll relax
[1:15:04] okay
[1:15:05] so we're good
[1:15:08] amen
[1:15:09] somebody told me i'm good i'm glad
[1:15:11] you're keeping one service i say yes
[1:15:13] because what you get
[1:15:15] when you go home you're gonna sit and
[1:15:17] keep talking about it keep talking about
[1:15:19] it keep talking about it keep talking
[1:15:20] about it amen
[1:15:22] luke chapter 16
[1:15:27] you're chewing on your steak you're
[1:15:28] talking about the word
[1:15:35] look 16 25
[1:15:37] verse 25 but abram you know the story
[1:15:41] the continuation of the story
[1:15:43] but abram said
[1:15:45] son
[1:15:46] remember that you in your lifetime
[1:15:49] receive your good things
[1:15:51] and likewise lazarus evil things
[1:15:55] but now he is comforted
[1:15:57] and you are tormented i will come back
[1:15:59] to this because we left you with a
[1:16:01] question
[1:16:02] is hell burning or not i'm not going to
[1:16:05] touch on that because your boss sent me
[1:16:07] in the different territory then we're
[1:16:09] going to come back amen
[1:16:11] and beside all this
[1:16:13] between us and you there is a great gulf
[1:16:16] the bridge is broken
[1:16:19] no bridge is there
[1:16:20] so that day which will pass from here
[1:16:23] to you cannot neither day
[1:16:26] pass to us
[1:16:28] neither can they pass to us that would
[1:16:31] come from here in other words nobody can
[1:16:33] live here go there nobody can come from
[1:16:35] here and go down on the other side
[1:16:37] then he said i pray you therefore father
[1:16:41] that you would send him
[1:16:43] to my father's house to do what
[1:16:46] now you start caring about what jesus
[1:16:48] was trying to make you do
[1:16:53] you see now
[1:16:54] jesus was trying to use that
[1:16:58] that's why jesus said come and follow me
[1:17:02] in other words come and be my disciple
[1:17:06] because every disciple of jesus christ
[1:17:09] was a preacher
[1:17:14] all the 12 disciples of jesus christ
[1:17:16] were preachers
[1:17:18] even judah was a preacher
[1:17:22] in other words when jesus looked he saw
[1:17:24] a gift
[1:17:27] in him
[1:17:28] amen he said the only way you can
[1:17:30] operate that gift properly
[1:17:33] you need to be with me
[1:17:36] he rejected it because of his
[1:17:39] great possession
[1:17:41] now when he's in hell
[1:17:44] the gift begins to work
[1:17:46] because in hell his possession is all
[1:17:48] gone
[1:17:50] there is no more possession they stay in
[1:17:52] the earth
[1:17:53] now he is in the fifth dimension
[1:17:56] there is no more possession now the gift
[1:17:59] begin to torment him
[1:18:05] hallelujah
[1:18:07] amen
[1:18:08] he said
[1:18:09] then i say then he say i pray you
[1:18:12] therefore father that you would send him
[1:18:15] to my father's house verse 28 for i have
[1:18:19] five brethren
[1:18:20] why you didn't worry about them to begin
[1:18:22] with
[1:18:24] you were worried about to make how much
[1:18:27] to make so much money like amazon
[1:18:31] amen
[1:18:32] like basil the boss
[1:18:35] if you work on amazon that's fine i'm
[1:18:37] just talking about the boss
[1:18:40] don't want to say all the pastors say
[1:18:41] working on amazon
[1:18:45] amen for i have five brethren that he
[1:18:48] may testify to them
[1:18:50] lest they also come into this place of
[1:18:53] water
[1:18:54] now he doesn't want anybody to do what
[1:18:57] he did
[1:18:58] [Music]
[1:18:59] go tell them
[1:19:01] don't come this route how did you came
[1:19:04] to this route
[1:19:06] how did you made it to hell because you
[1:19:08] rejected
[1:19:09] the word made flesh
[1:19:16] you rejected the message of the hour
[1:19:20] [Music]
[1:19:23] everybody clear
[1:19:24] when the message was presented you
[1:19:27] rejected it
[1:19:30] ticket visa straight
[1:19:33] amen
[1:19:34] to the fifth dimension let's pray
[1:19:37] heavenly father
[1:19:39] lord we thank you again father for your
[1:19:41] grace your love your mercy and for
[1:19:43] giving us an opportunity to be able to
[1:19:46] gather together this morning lord
[1:19:48] in your house to hear from thee and not
[1:19:51] from a man
[1:19:52] lord we have done what any men can do
[1:19:55] here on planet earth if you have given
[1:19:58] them the ability to do so they can read
[1:20:01] the scripture lord but when it comes to
[1:20:03] feeding your sheep
[1:20:05] interpreting the spirit the the
[1:20:07] scripture being the inside teacher that
[1:20:10] only take the holy spirit that's why
[1:20:13] lord i'm surrendering myself in this
[1:20:15] church if there is anything that we've
[1:20:18] done that might below the hinges to our
[1:20:20] blessing this morning maybe the way we
[1:20:23] behave at home
[1:20:24] or debate the way we behave throughout
[1:20:26] the week lord
[1:20:27] father may your blood cover us and may
[1:20:30] you forgive us lord may you move us
[1:20:33] completely out of the way lord and may
[1:20:35] you grant unto us a special service lord
[1:20:38] that you can come down lord and minister
[1:20:41] to your children according to their need
[1:20:43] we commit everything unto the hand be
[1:20:46] the alpha and the omega the beginning
[1:20:48] and the ending of this service lord as
[1:20:51] we ask it in the name of jesus christ
[1:20:54] amen
[1:20:56] god bless you
[1:20:57] whoever is over there you got a punch on
[1:21:00] this
[1:21:01] today
[1:21:02] we're going to talk about the region of
[1:21:05] gadaria
[1:21:07] ouch
[1:21:09] i'm saying gatorade because that's how
[1:21:11] brother branham said it
[1:21:13] if you need this uh
[1:21:14] the message you go listen to the magniac
[1:21:17] of gallery
[1:21:19] the subject today is the region of
[1:21:22] gaddaria anybody clear
[1:21:25] last time we talk about hell
[1:21:27] last sunday and we found out that hell
[1:21:31] number one was a prison
[1:21:33] anybody clear
[1:21:35] and not only was hell a prison he was a
[1:21:38] prison
[1:21:40] of chains of darkness
[1:21:43] everybody clear
[1:21:45] and not only was
[1:21:47] was it a prison
[1:21:49] of chance of darkness
[1:21:52] we spoke again last time that hell was a
[1:21:55] place of disorder
[1:21:57] you remember that
[1:21:59] because everybody that got in here
[1:22:02] originally was in heaven
[1:22:04] they had position and habitation in
[1:22:07] heaven
[1:22:08] but they all
[1:22:10] sin with lucifer and they all lost their
[1:22:13] position and they found themselves in
[1:22:16] the prison of everlasting chains of
[1:22:18] darkness called the prison of hell and
[1:22:22] because they lost their position when
[1:22:24] they got to hell
[1:22:25] everybody have a different position they
[1:22:28] don't know where they belong hell became
[1:22:30] now a place of disorder everybody clear
[1:22:34] a man who brings disorder in a church is
[1:22:37] usually a man who is not in his right
[1:22:41] position
[1:22:45] let's keep moving amen
[1:22:47] hell also we found last sunday
[1:22:50] that hell was a horrible place
[1:22:53] hell was a horrible place to the lost
[1:22:57] souls
[1:22:59] and hell was a horrible place to
[1:23:01] demonstrate
[1:23:04] amen
[1:23:05] the lord saw that's the reason why the
[1:23:07] rich young ruler didn't want anybody to
[1:23:10] come where he was
[1:23:12] because he was a lost soul he didn't
[1:23:14] want anybody to come to hell he have
[1:23:17] enough sense even though he was in here
[1:23:20] to make sure nobody has come where he is
[1:23:23] at
[1:23:24] everybody here that was the gift that
[1:23:26] god placed in his life
[1:23:28] amen and the demons themselves do not
[1:23:31] want to be in hell because last sunday
[1:23:34] we found out that they begged jesus
[1:23:36] christ you can cast us out
[1:23:39] but do not send us back to hell so hell
[1:23:43] is a very very horrible place
[1:23:46] amen then when we dealt with those
[1:23:50] demons we found out that those demons
[1:23:52] were dwelling in tombs
[1:23:55] amen
[1:23:56] and the tombs is a place where you have
[1:23:59] dead
[1:24:00] things at a cemetery everything is dead
[1:24:05] there is no life there and we talk from
[1:24:08] there about the atmosphere
[1:24:11] everybody clear
[1:24:12] everybody here the atmosphere is very
[1:24:15] important
[1:24:17] we are getting closer and sooner you can
[1:24:20] see people
[1:24:21] are getting ready to celebrate halloween
[1:24:26] and when you watch what they are putting
[1:24:29] in their houses
[1:24:30] they're bringing tombs in their houses
[1:24:34] they're bringing skeletons in the houses
[1:24:37] they're bringing dead stuff in their
[1:24:40] houses to decorate their houses like
[1:24:43] cemetery
[1:24:45] making it an air conditioning for the
[1:24:47] devil
[1:24:50] halloween is of the devil
[1:24:53] it is a party that prepare your home for
[1:24:56] devils
[1:24:58] trigger tree is of the devil
[1:25:03] if you get something that pretend to
[1:25:05] halloween in your house get it out
[1:25:08] because you are creating a dead
[1:25:10] atmosphere in your home
[1:25:13] and the devil loves dead atmosphere
[1:25:18] you are the one buying that with your
[1:25:20] money and bringing that to your house
[1:25:24] and you think you are worshiping the
[1:25:26] dead you are actually making a
[1:25:28] comfortable place for the demon of hell
[1:25:32] to come to your house
[1:25:35] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:25:38] brother branham say did you ever get
[1:25:41] around anybody
[1:25:43] you have seen nice people
[1:25:45] that you could not hardly stand to be
[1:25:48] around them
[1:25:49] yeah
[1:25:50] now you know that's right isn't it
[1:25:53] and i have seen people that maybe that
[1:25:56] you just love to be in their presence
[1:25:59] haven't you seen people like that
[1:26:02] when you start fellowshipping you don't
[1:26:04] want to go home
[1:26:06] you can start one hour two hours three
[1:26:08] hours four hours you gotta stop
[1:26:10] somewhere because if not you're not
[1:26:12] gonna go back to sleep
[1:26:14] everybody clear so there is something
[1:26:17] about those people
[1:26:18] that keep their fellowship going on
[1:26:23] do you realize that you are sons of god
[1:26:27] the atmosphere
[1:26:30] the water
[1:26:31] the air that you live in
[1:26:34] you create water
[1:26:37] around you that either
[1:26:40] or water
[1:26:41] so if demon keep following you what are
[1:26:44] you doing in your life
[1:26:46] [Music]
[1:26:48] if that spirit keeps hanging on you what
[1:26:51] are you doing in your life
[1:26:54] you can create a circumstance
[1:26:58] that can make that devil uncomfortable
[1:27:01] or you can create a circumstance
[1:27:05] that can make that devil comfortable
[1:27:08] it depends on what you are creating
[1:27:11] that's the reason why that devil keeps
[1:27:13] hanging around you
[1:27:16] hallelujah i better leave that subject
[1:27:20] alone
[1:27:21] i read what i was going to because i'm
[1:27:24] afraid you are not getting that
[1:27:27] that is water
[1:27:30] don't preach the deepest thing
[1:27:34] that is deeper thing
[1:27:36] that the church has
[1:27:38] yet got to preach
[1:27:46] [Laughter]
[1:27:48] that the church has got to learn
[1:27:50] that is right deeper things
[1:27:53] we are taught in this ritualistic and so
[1:27:56] forth
[1:27:57] and it sat down and cut and drive for us
[1:28:00] that's what you want motivational
[1:28:02] speaking
[1:28:03] but when you come into the real it is
[1:28:06] not something way off
[1:28:09] you can't understand it's just as close
[1:28:12] as your hand is to you you just look
[1:28:15] over to the top of it
[1:28:17] it is so simple till you overlook it
[1:28:21] you complicate your life for nothing
[1:28:24] overthinking and reasoning on the word
[1:28:27] of god
[1:28:28] the word of god is simple
[1:28:30] just create an atmosphere and it's going
[1:28:33] to take care of the devils
[1:28:36] brother david give me a little bit more
[1:28:38] so i won't lose my my voice everybody
[1:28:40] clear so far
[1:28:41] then this region here
[1:28:44] called the region of galleria
[1:28:47] it's a region that was made
[1:28:50] really that the fame of this region came
[1:28:53] because of this man
[1:28:57] this maniac
[1:28:59] this man that was filled with devils
[1:29:01] that's the reason why we begin to know
[1:29:03] more about this region
[1:29:06] what is going on with this region of
[1:29:09] gallery everybody clear so far
[1:29:13] hallelujah
[1:29:15] amen
[1:29:17] brother branham say i gave you that key
[1:29:20] that god gave first
[1:29:22] an initial revelation
[1:29:24] a first revelation
[1:29:26] then god does not change the revelation
[1:29:30] but what god does he add more to that
[1:29:33] revelation
[1:29:34] to make the revelation more what
[1:29:37] clear so that his children can get it
[1:29:40] everybody here
[1:29:42] according to mark 5
[1:29:46] verse 1
[1:29:47] the bible says that they came over
[1:29:50] onto the other side of the sea
[1:29:53] into the country of water
[1:29:57] into the country of the gathering that's
[1:29:59] the region we're talking about according
[1:30:02] to mark
[1:30:04] came into the country
[1:30:06] of gathering
[1:30:08] everybody clear so far
[1:30:10] according to luke chapter 8 verse 26
[1:30:15] and they arrive at the country of water
[1:30:18] which is over against what
[1:30:21] the sea of galilee because jesus have to
[1:30:23] cross the sea
[1:30:25] and he was buffeted with devils and he
[1:30:27] have to speak to the sea peace be still
[1:30:30] if you read your scripture
[1:30:31] so according to luke luke is talking
[1:30:35] about the same thing
[1:30:36] the country of gatherings
[1:30:39] everybody so far
[1:30:41] we're growing up
[1:30:43] first two and when he was come out of
[1:30:46] the ship
[1:30:47] immediately
[1:30:48] they met him out of the tomb of water
[1:30:51] how many men
[1:30:56] according to mark
[1:30:58] one man
[1:31:00] hey
[1:31:02] with an unclean spirit
[1:31:04] and always night and day he was in the
[1:31:07] mountains
[1:31:09] and in the water
[1:31:11] you understand now
[1:31:12] crying and cutting himself with water
[1:31:17] so when you see the people cutting
[1:31:19] themselves out
[1:31:20] you know what is going on with those
[1:31:22] people
[1:31:23] everybody here
[1:31:25] they're under demonic spirit
[1:31:27] you go to the east saying institution
[1:31:30] you see people cutting themselves up
[1:31:32] it's a demon
[1:31:34] according to luke chapter 8 verse 27
[1:31:38] and when he went forth to land
[1:31:41] they met him out of the city a water
[1:31:44] how many men
[1:31:47] one
[1:31:50] anybody clear
[1:31:52] one man
[1:31:53] which had devils long time same story
[1:31:58] and we're not close now we got more
[1:32:01] detail
[1:32:02] amen
[1:32:03] neither a board in any house
[1:32:06] but in the water
[1:32:08] so according to mark
[1:32:11] according to luke we found out that the
[1:32:14] man that was there seems to be the only
[1:32:18] one that was present in the tombs
[1:32:21] everybody here so far
[1:32:23] when you go to the book of matthew
[1:32:25] chapter 8 verse 28
[1:32:28] matthew is talking about the same
[1:32:31] story
[1:32:33] anybody clear
[1:32:35] matthew says
[1:32:37] that when he was come on the other side
[1:32:41] in the country of the water
[1:32:44] gergeson and gatherings is the same name
[1:32:50] everybody here
[1:32:52] in the country of the gergeson amen
[1:32:56] they met him how many
[1:33:01] who's telling the truth
[1:33:04] who's lying
[1:33:06] both of them are telling the truth
[1:33:08] amen
[1:33:10] they met him how many
[1:33:12] to possess with the devil
[1:33:15] coming out of water
[1:33:17] the same story everybody here so far
[1:33:19] coming out of there of the tomb
[1:33:22] exceeding fears
[1:33:24] so that no man
[1:33:26] might pass by that way
[1:33:30] so according to matthew
[1:33:32] we need to upgrade our story
[1:33:37] are we there
[1:33:39] instead of looking at one man out of the
[1:33:41] tomb
[1:33:43] from today now we understand that there
[1:33:45] were how many people
[1:33:47] there were two people so we can drop
[1:33:50] that picture now and we can pull a
[1:33:52] second picture
[1:33:55] why was that two men
[1:33:59] all from eternity
[1:34:01] we spoke and we found out that there is
[1:34:04] always two kingdoms
[1:34:06] anybody here
[1:34:08] we have the kingdom of god
[1:34:10] and we have the kingdom of the devil
[1:34:14] and brother branham said every revolver
[1:34:17] have always watered
[1:34:19] he have twins
[1:34:21] everybody here
[1:34:22] and those twins started all the way from
[1:34:26] eden
[1:34:28] when you have a can
[1:34:30] automatically you're going to have an
[1:34:32] able
[1:34:34] when you have the crow in the arkham
[1:34:37] you're going to have the dove in the orc
[1:34:40] when you have isaac
[1:34:42] you're going to have ishmael
[1:34:45] when you have esau
[1:34:47] you're gonna have jacob
[1:34:50] when you have the battler
[1:34:53] you're gonna have the backhand
[1:34:56] when you have one fifth at the cross
[1:34:58] that is going to paradise
[1:35:01] you're going to have another fifa the
[1:35:03] cross that is going to hell
[1:35:05] when you have jesus christ
[1:35:08] you're also going to have judah
[1:35:10] all around the scripture there is always
[1:35:14] two
[1:35:15] but mark and luke
[1:35:17] focus on the one that was saved
[1:35:22] [Music]
[1:35:26] ever here because those two always shows
[1:35:30] which origin they came from
[1:35:33] esau and jacob came out from the same
[1:35:36] womb
[1:35:37] these two evil men came out from the
[1:35:41] same place
[1:35:42] but one was saved
[1:35:44] and the other one nothing was spoken
[1:35:47] about him
[1:35:51] everybody here
[1:35:52] ever here
[1:35:55] who told
[1:35:57] these people that jesus was coming
[1:36:03] they didn't have internet
[1:36:06] they didn't have newspaper
[1:36:09] they didn't have flyer that jesus sent
[1:36:12] ahead of time
[1:36:14] saying that i'm coming to the city
[1:36:17] they didn't have a tv
[1:36:20] they didn't have telephone
[1:36:22] but somehow
[1:36:24] instead of jesus being there and the
[1:36:28] people of the city ready to welcome
[1:36:31] jesus the one that welcomed jesus was a
[1:36:35] man filled with devils
[1:36:39] who told that man that jesus was coming
[1:36:45] everybody here
[1:36:46] there will be there is a time
[1:36:49] that the devil will destroy your life
[1:36:53] there is a time that the devil will make
[1:36:56] you suffer
[1:36:57] there is a time that the devil will take
[1:37:00] you to drinking
[1:37:02] there is a time that the devil will take
[1:37:04] you to the nightclub
[1:37:06] there is a time that the devil will make
[1:37:09] you smoke pipe
[1:37:10] there is a time that the devil will take
[1:37:13] you here and there
[1:37:15] but when the time of god
[1:37:18] comes are you there
[1:37:21] are you there you don't need no news on
[1:37:24] the television
[1:37:26] the devil that was benefiting you
[1:37:29] now no longer strong
[1:37:32] to block you from accessing your making
[1:37:36] the devil that drove him in the tomb
[1:37:40] when his time of deliverance came
[1:37:43] the same devil drove him to church
[1:37:47] [Applause]
[1:37:51] are you there
[1:37:53] how did you get saved
[1:37:55] you got saved when you were a sinner
[1:37:58] why you didn't run away from church
[1:38:01] but that day
[1:38:02] you ended up in church
[1:38:04] because it was time for the
[1:38:06] predestinated seed to be quickened
[1:38:10] and when the big madness began to come
[1:38:13] as jesus christ is approaching the
[1:38:17] predestinated seed begin to move
[1:38:19] and when the predestination begin to
[1:38:22] move there is no devil in hell
[1:38:26] how many deaths you have
[1:38:28] even if you have religion
[1:38:31] even if you have the whole hell it won't
[1:38:34] stop you from getting your deliverance

[1:42:40] in the day of elias when the heaven was
[1:42:43] shut up three years and six months when
[1:42:46] a great famine was throughout the land
[1:42:48] but unto water
[1:42:52] was a liarson
[1:42:54] save who
[1:42:57] and to surrepta a city of saturn and to
[1:43:00] a woman that was a water
[1:43:02] there was many widows but only one
[1:43:06] anybody here
[1:43:08] and many lepers were in israel in the
[1:43:11] time of elizabeth
[1:43:13] elisha the prophet and none of them was
[1:43:16] queen saving who
[1:43:19] many were in the tombs
[1:43:21] with devil
[1:43:22] only one
[1:43:24] in the pool of bethesda he got he only
[1:43:27] got one
[1:43:29] he's after his seed
[1:43:31] amen
[1:43:32] and the rapture is the same thing
[1:43:36] i tell you
[1:43:37] in that match there shall be two men in
[1:43:40] one bed
[1:43:42] the bible didn't say two men having
[1:43:44] sexual relationships
[1:43:47] two men can be in one bed doesn't mean
[1:43:50] they're doing that
[1:43:52] as stupidity
[1:43:55] amen
[1:43:56] in that night there shall be two men in
[1:43:58] one bed the one shall be water
[1:44:02] and the other water
[1:44:04] two women shall be grinding together the
[1:44:07] one shall be taken and the other water
[1:44:10] two men shall be in the field the one
[1:44:12] shall be taken and the other one
[1:44:15] two
[1:44:16] in the tomb
[1:44:17] one
[1:44:18] taken out
[1:44:21] and they are the armor
[1:44:24] everybody here so far
[1:44:26] everybody clear so far
[1:44:28] as we look at this region of gallery
[1:44:31] brother branham said in the maniac of
[1:44:33] gadoia he said i see him
[1:44:36] in his work as he was tossed there in
[1:44:39] the little old sea
[1:44:41] and one soul
[1:44:44] out of the entire region
[1:44:47] god only save
[1:44:51] [Music]
[1:44:54] one soul was in need of it
[1:44:58] we never have a record
[1:45:00] of anyone else being water
[1:45:03] in that land of the gatherings but this
[1:45:06] one maniac
[1:45:08] poor fellow i think of him being out
[1:45:11] there in that condition perhaps one time
[1:45:14] a good citizen a good man
[1:45:17] where does brother branham knows that
[1:45:20] that nobody else was saved beside him
[1:45:23] how did he know it
[1:45:24] in the book of luke
[1:45:26] chapter 8
[1:45:28] then the whole multitude
[1:45:30] of the country of the gatherings round
[1:45:33] about
[1:45:35] besott him to the water
[1:45:38] everybody
[1:45:40] say get out of this place
[1:45:44] for they were taken with great field
[1:45:47] and went up into the ship and returned
[1:45:50] back again
[1:45:51] so this man begged jesus
[1:45:54] he said father can i go with you i don't
[1:45:57] want to stay again here
[1:45:59] jesus turn around and say no
[1:46:02] you don't go with me
[1:46:04] you're going to stay here to witness
[1:46:07] return to their own house
[1:46:09] and show how great things god has done
[1:46:13] unto thee and he went his way and did
[1:46:16] what
[1:46:17] published throughout the world
[1:46:19] how great things jesus has done unto
[1:46:22] whom
[1:46:23] the whole city cast out jesus christ
[1:46:30] jesus had to preach himself in prison
[1:46:35] because they rejected him
[1:46:38] jesus took that part of ministry
[1:46:41] and left him
[1:46:42] he said you go testify to those souls in
[1:46:44] prison
[1:46:46] i have certain things to do
[1:46:48] you the only one i have to save but the
[1:46:50] word must be preached to them so i can
[1:46:53] condemn them
[1:46:55] at the next time
[1:46:57] the men begin to be a preacher of souls
[1:47:00] in prison
[1:47:01] everybody clear so far
[1:47:03] so that region a whole region
[1:47:06] filled with other people only one person
[1:47:10] saved
[1:47:12] what's going on with this region of the
[1:47:14] gallery
[1:47:16] the bible says we saw this last week
[1:47:19] that the
[1:47:21] they demons him
[1:47:22] that he would not command them to go out
[1:47:25] into water
[1:47:27] number one when the devil came to jesus
[1:47:30] christ
[1:47:31] they fell down and worshiped him
[1:47:34] i will show you that down the road
[1:47:36] number two debate jesus christ
[1:47:39] we don't want to go
[1:47:41] into the deep
[1:47:44] usually we have a tendency to think that
[1:47:48] number one they just told jesus we want
[1:47:50] to go into the pig
[1:47:52] but that was not the case
[1:47:54] the first thing they told jesus do not
[1:47:57] send us to hell
[1:48:00] you must think that after that they told
[1:48:02] jesus christ let's go to the pig but
[1:48:04] that was not the case again
[1:48:07] watch it clearly
[1:48:09] amen
[1:48:10] in mark chapter 5 verse 6
[1:48:13] the bible says but when he saw jesus
[1:48:16] afar pharaoh
[1:48:17] he run and did what
[1:48:20] why did the devil block him from
[1:48:22] worshiping christ
[1:48:28] why
[1:48:29] the devil are not strong as you think
[1:48:33] it's just a matter of time
[1:48:37] amen
[1:48:39] why they didn't bring this man to jesus
[1:48:42] and he began to cast jesus
[1:48:45] why they didn't bring this man to jesus
[1:48:48] so that he can get the stone and begin
[1:48:50] to bid on jesus but when they brought
[1:48:52] him to jesus
[1:48:54] he began to worship
[1:48:59] the power of your predestinated seed
[1:49:02] when it starts working
[1:49:04] there is no devil in hell
[1:49:07] there is no power
[1:49:09] it comes automatically
[1:49:14] hallelujah
[1:49:15] he said and he asked him what is the
[1:49:19] name
[1:49:20] and he answered saying my name is legion
[1:49:23] for we are water
[1:49:25] one voice
[1:49:27] and he besought him much
[1:49:32] that
[1:49:34] he will not
[1:49:35] send them a way of water
[1:49:44] they say
[1:49:45] we don't want to go to hell
[1:49:48] you hear me
[1:49:49] but we asking you one thing
[1:49:51] we love this country
[1:49:58] what was in that country
[1:50:00] that the devil requested jesus christ
[1:50:05] that don't send us to hell but leave us
[1:50:08] in this country
[1:50:10] this is a beautiful
[1:50:12] air-conditioning place for us
[1:50:15] the country the region of the galleria
[1:50:21] a region requested by the devil
[1:50:25] what was in that region
[1:50:27] because that region was in israel
[1:50:33] anybody here
[1:50:35] israel was like this
[1:50:39] ever here and that region was over here
[1:50:43] about here
[1:50:44] this is the region of jewish people
[1:50:48] people that worship god
[1:50:50] people that worship jehovah are the true
[1:50:52] god
[1:50:53] but the devil claiming to jesus christ
[1:50:57] don't send us to hell we rather stay in
[1:51:00] this country
[1:51:02] what is in that region
[1:51:05] that attracted the devil
[1:51:08] hallelujah
[1:51:10] number one
[1:51:11] we don't want to go to the deep
[1:51:13] number two we want to stay in this
[1:51:16] country
[1:51:18] number three now there was the night
[1:51:22] unto the mountain a great head of water
[1:51:28] anybody clear so far
[1:51:30] hallelujah give me time
[1:51:33] let's go
[1:51:35] number one
[1:51:37] we don't want to go to hell
[1:51:39] go to hell we don't want to do it
[1:51:42] number two we want to stay here
[1:51:45] in this country or in this region
[1:51:48] of galleria
[1:51:50] number three in the same region we found
[1:51:54] out that they were water
[1:51:59] the bible didn't say they were lamps
[1:52:07] the bible never says they were goats
[1:52:13] the bible says they were sworn or peak
[1:52:16] day
[1:52:18] hallelujah
[1:52:20] amen and all the devil
[1:52:24] besought him
[1:52:25] turn the request
[1:52:28] and you think jesus is tired of hearing
[1:52:31] you
[1:52:32] when he can heal the devil three times
[1:52:35] the devil praying
[1:52:41] if a devil has a right to bring the
[1:52:44] request to christ
[1:52:47] before the blood of jesus was shed
[1:52:51] how much more do you have boldness to
[1:52:54] bring your request to god after the
[1:52:57] blood has been shed
[1:53:00] [Music]
[1:53:05] you who came from god
[1:53:09] this didn't come from god but they have
[1:53:12] a right to ask god
[1:53:15] and god answered them
[1:53:18] and gave them what they wanted
[1:53:25] hallelujah
[1:53:27] and all therefore besought him
[1:53:29] saying
[1:53:30] send us into the water
[1:53:33] that we may do whatever
[1:53:36] why did he want to go to the lamps
[1:53:40] the devil want to enter the shrine
[1:53:45] hallelujah
[1:53:47] the region of the gallery
[1:53:50] and fourth with jesus gave them leave he
[1:53:54] granted their desire
[1:53:56] and the unclean spirit went out
[1:53:59] and entered into the swan
[1:54:02] and the herd ran violently down a steep
[1:54:05] place into the sea
[1:54:06] they were about water
[1:54:12] so if you were in a bird not eating pigs
[1:54:17] because the devil got into pigs
[1:54:20] the devil got into two thousand pigs
[1:54:24] and those two thousand people died
[1:54:27] so you ready and free to eat your pork
[1:54:29] chop
[1:54:35] there is a religion that said do not eat
[1:54:38] pigs because the devil got into them
[1:54:41] and they never understood that it was
[1:54:43] only two thousand devil
[1:54:45] not all the pigs in the world and those
[1:54:48] that got the devil all of them died
[1:54:52] you need a prophet
[1:54:57] hallelujah they were about two thousand
[1:55:01] and one chuck into the water
[1:55:03] number one they don't want to go to hell
[1:55:06] number two they want to stay in the
[1:55:09] country
[1:55:10] and jesus is still looking they say wait
[1:55:12] a minute look over there the demon
[1:55:15] themself
[1:55:16] show jesus the pig
[1:55:24] what was pig doing
[1:55:26] in the country of israel
[1:55:33] are we okay
[1:55:34] is everybody awake
[1:55:37] hallelujah blessed be the name of the
[1:55:39] lord brother bonham says that you know
[1:55:44] jesus said to those demons come out
[1:55:47] and they say sufferers to go into them
[1:55:50] swan
[1:55:51] see a devil is water
[1:55:55] if he doesn't have a water
[1:56:01] don't be the playground of the devil
[1:56:07] when we say stop wearing your high heel
[1:56:11] stop wearing your head here because when
[1:56:13] you put your heart here you are bringing
[1:56:16] a devil on you
[1:56:18] [Music]
[1:56:23] devil
[1:56:25] cannot work
[1:56:28] devil cannot work unless they are in the
[1:56:30] water
[1:56:32] amen
[1:56:35] he is just a spirit
[1:56:37] in the world until he is in the body
[1:56:40] then he can do water
[1:56:44] you battling spirit
[1:56:46] what are you doing in your life
[1:56:48] how do you dress
[1:56:50] you dress tight
[1:56:52] you show in your shape
[1:56:55] you pulling somebody
[1:57:02] hallelujah
[1:57:03] brother of adam saying in the message
[1:57:05] testimony jesus cast out some demons out
[1:57:09] of a man from gatorade
[1:57:11] and they went into the herd of swan is
[1:57:14] that right
[1:57:15] demons are powerless
[1:57:18] unless they are water
[1:57:20] so they beg for mercy even to go into
[1:57:24] swan because jesus would not permit them
[1:57:28] in human water
[1:57:32] hallelujah
[1:57:33] brother branham continuing the living
[1:57:35] christ
[1:57:36] if you are skeptic
[1:57:38] i would not stay
[1:57:40] in while this is going on
[1:57:43] i want to pray for the sick
[1:57:44] if you somebody who had doubt
[1:57:47] i prefer that you leave her
[1:57:50] because if that person is freed
[1:57:53] you are certainly a good subject to him
[1:57:56] next
[1:57:57] it shall take place you know
[1:57:59] now he comes right from one to another
[1:58:02] in other words when a devil leaves
[1:58:04] somebody they want to go somewhere else
[1:58:10] those demons must have water
[1:58:16] not only do they need a body they also
[1:58:19] need water
[1:58:22] don't make your house
[1:58:25] a place for devils
[1:58:28] [Music]
[1:58:33] young people you're struggling
[1:58:35] look at what you're doing
[1:58:37] look at what you're posting
[1:58:39] your picture is showing a last spirit
[1:58:43] [Music]

[1:58:48] time you must change your posting
[1:58:51] and you see this even in married women
[1:58:54] who are you impressing
[1:58:57] your husband
[1:58:59] are you impressing your congregation
[1:59:02] that you have online
[1:59:04] that you have to change picture and they
[1:59:05] keep liking liking liking liking

[1:59:25] your whatsapp i will see through your
[1:59:26] friends

[1:59:33] somebody pulled their facebook and said
[1:59:35] brother stephen look and i begin to see
[1:59:38] that through other people
[1:59:41] and i was amazed what i was looking at
[1:59:46] it's going to catch you one day
[1:59:48] sometime i take even snapshot
[1:59:51] so when you doubt i say look
[1:59:58] me do it quickly
[2:00:00] whatever you have to do like judah go
[2:00:02] ahead and do it
[2:00:04] those demons must have a place
[2:00:07] must have a body on their water helpless
[2:00:10] they want to go into a bunch of hogs one
[2:00:13] day when they came out of the mania
[2:00:16] canada
[2:00:17] remember in the bible when a spirit was
[2:00:20] cast out of a man they said let us go
[2:00:23] over and get in them hugs
[2:00:26] they are powerless until they have a
[2:00:28] placed water
[2:00:30] a spirit need a place
[2:00:33] or a body and the appropriate place is
[2:00:36] hell
[2:00:37] but they don't want to go to hell
[2:00:39] they want to stay on this world
[2:00:42] because they're looking for who is
[2:00:44] inviting them
[2:00:46] you invite them by the atmosphere you
[2:00:49] creating iran
[2:00:51] everybody here
[2:00:53] so what
[2:00:55] have the jew to do with peace
[2:00:59] hallelujah because they begged to go
[2:01:02] into the pig
[2:01:03] brother i'm saying the message the
[2:01:05] prodigal
[2:01:06] he had to get himself a job
[2:01:10] so he went to a citizen of the country a
[2:01:13] water
[2:01:16] a pig raiser or a swan raiser
[2:01:19] look where he dropped from now a jew
[2:01:24] not even supposed to put his hands on
[2:01:27] the water
[2:01:29] not only a natural not only a living pig
[2:01:32] even if you found a pig that is dead a
[2:01:36] jew was not supposed to touch it
[2:01:39] [Music]
[2:01:41] but these jews
[2:01:43] had two thousand pigs they were
[2:01:48] raising hallelujah
[2:01:52] he was in need he was starving and he
[2:01:55] had to take a job
[2:02:00] and they gave him the worst thing
[2:02:03] that is the way the devil does
[2:02:07] just as soon as he get he can get you
[2:02:11] started down the hill he shall trample
[2:02:14] you with everything he's got
[2:02:18] begin to backslide
[2:02:20] you're going to find yourself working in
[2:02:22] a nightclub
[2:02:26] selling whiskey
[2:02:28] leviticus 11 7. where did brother
[2:02:31] branham get this
[2:02:33] the bible say underwater
[2:02:36] the swan
[2:02:38] though he divided the rule the hoof
[2:02:41] and be clothed and folded
[2:02:44] yet he choose not the card
[2:02:46] he is water
[2:02:50] of their flesh the pig
[2:02:53] shall you not eat
[2:02:56] and do carcass shall he not water they
[2:03:00] are water
[2:03:01] so the pig is unclean
[2:03:05] the flesh of a piggies and cream
[2:03:08] even the carcass of a pig is unclean
[2:03:13] but this region
[2:03:15] called the region of galeria was raising
[2:03:18] unclean thing to god
[2:03:22] and the devil have enough sense
[2:03:25] to tell jesus
[2:03:27] there is an unclean thing there
[2:03:30] you taught them through moses
[2:03:33] do not eat pig
[2:03:34] you tell them to moses
[2:03:37] do not even have pig you taught them
[2:03:40] through moses do not even touch the
[2:03:42] cutters of a pig
[2:03:44] look what they're doing there is a bunch
[2:03:46] of pigs there
[2:03:47] so if you don't want to you don't have
[2:03:50] any option we got option
[2:03:52] we can go into the pig because pig are
[2:03:54] unclean to them
[2:03:56] and jesus said you are right
[2:03:59] go ahead and enter
[2:04:04] a region
[2:04:06] that have legions of
[2:04:09] region
[2:04:11] that was raising swan
[2:04:13] a region that the devil requested
[2:04:16] to stay there
[2:04:18] why a jewish region
[2:04:22] can be a place that the devil requested
[2:04:26] are we okay
[2:04:28] are we okay
[2:04:30] the devil begin to show jesus christ
[2:04:33] there is absurdy
[2:04:34] send me there
[2:04:36] i will be all right
[2:04:38] because you told them not to do this
[2:04:41] everybody
[2:04:43] so when jesus
[2:04:45] look
[2:04:46] jesus saw that something that is unclean
[2:04:51] was in the land of israel
[2:04:54] and the word when it came
[2:04:57] have to bring sanctification
[2:05:00] do you follow me
[2:05:02] so jesus gave the devil
[2:05:04] permission to go into the pig to wipe
[2:05:08] that on cleansing
[2:05:11] [Music]
[2:05:12] you follow me
[2:05:14] that's why when the devil entered they
[2:05:17] drove the pig into
[2:05:19] the sea
[2:05:20] and destroy their business
[2:05:24] jesus the word
[2:05:26] begin to clean the land
[2:05:28] of the gallery
[2:05:31] jesus understood that the devil are
[2:05:34] claiming this land
[2:05:36] this is the promised land
[2:05:38] that i send my children
[2:05:40] so let me begin to clean the land remove
[2:05:43] everything that is unclean from the rain
[2:05:49] the land of the galleria
[2:05:52] what happened when jesus began to bring
[2:05:55] sanctification
[2:05:57] the people got mad
[2:05:59] we don't want him again here we don't
[2:06:02] want this kind of religion here
[2:06:04] this religion is taking off my high heel
[2:06:07] this religion is taking off my makeup
[2:06:10] this world is taking up my fornication
[2:06:13] life this world is taking off all my tat
[2:06:16] dresses all my paint we don't want this
[2:06:19] word here
[2:06:21] [Music]
[2:06:24] in other words the people of this region
[2:06:26] were more comfortable with devils
[2:06:31] then with the world meditation
[2:06:34] they don't want a ministry that's going
[2:06:37] to challenge their life
[2:06:39] they don't want a ministry that's going
[2:06:42] to clean up their life they want a
[2:06:44] ministry that will house devil
[2:06:48] a ministry that will pet your demons
[2:06:55] hallelujah
[2:06:57] how did the hug get there
[2:07:01] buckle up
[2:07:02] are you tired
[2:07:06] the bible says
[2:07:09] in the book of deuteronomy
[2:07:12] the bible says
[2:07:14] that it shall be
[2:07:16] when the lord that god
[2:07:19] shall brought thee into the land
[2:07:21] which he swore unto the father
[2:07:24] to abraham to isaac and to jacob to give
[2:07:28] thee great and goodly water
[2:07:31] which that
[2:07:34] when god was talking to the jew
[2:07:37] about the land of israel the promised
[2:07:39] land canaan
[2:07:41] anybody clear
[2:07:43] god begin to give them the description
[2:07:45] of canaan
[2:07:47] he said cannon when i'm gonna bring you
[2:07:49] there
[2:07:50] i'm gonna bring you there and give you a
[2:07:52] house that you're not going to pay for
[2:07:56] you didn't build it
[2:07:58] you didn't feel it
[2:07:59] you didn't work for it
[2:08:01] when you get there i just give it to you
[2:08:04] anybody clear
[2:08:06] a house full of water
[2:08:09] good thing which that fearless not
[2:08:13] you didn't go to value city to buy for
[2:08:15] you
[2:08:16] i let somebody else work hard
[2:08:19] and you're gonna kill them and take over
[2:08:21] everything
[2:08:22] everybody clear a world digs
[2:08:26] and well digs which that dig is not you
[2:08:29] didn't work on those well
[2:08:32] in other words god took the serpent seed
[2:08:35] and put them there because the serpent
[2:08:37] seed is hard at work
[2:08:41] and he used their energy
[2:08:44] to build their kingdom for these
[2:08:46] children
[2:08:48] he saw have to go work
[2:08:50] jacob was not working
[2:08:53] jacob went just behind and pull up two
[2:08:56] kids
[2:08:59] you need scripture you see me
[2:09:02] venue vineyard and olive tree which that
[2:09:05] plant is not
[2:09:07] that's why when jesus came he told the
[2:09:09] jews
[2:09:10] look at the bird
[2:09:12] do you see them working
[2:09:15] i'm taking care of them
[2:09:17] why do you worry too much
[2:09:20] i want you to work
[2:09:22] but i want you to depend on me
[2:09:25] so whatever leader you work i can
[2:09:28] multiply it and you're going to
[2:09:30] understand it's me working
[2:09:34] but you want to brag
[2:09:36] you want to show people i work three

[2:13:07] the promised land
[2:13:10] was built
[2:13:12] to take care of the cattle
[2:13:19] lord didn't see this
[2:13:22] the rich young ruler didn't see that
[2:13:26] amen
[2:13:27] hallelujah
[2:13:29] that that means eat and be water
[2:13:34] are we okay
[2:13:36] buckle up
[2:13:38] everybody clear so now we understand the
[2:13:41] description of the promised land
[2:13:43] amen
[2:13:44] the place where abraham went
[2:13:47] and that's the place that lot refused
[2:13:50] he wanted to go to the other side
[2:13:53] on the east
[2:13:55] why
[2:13:56] did the region of gathering
[2:13:59] got demons
[2:14:00] you ready
[2:14:02] you ready
[2:14:04] all right
[2:14:05] here it is
[2:14:06] in number 32 verse 1
[2:14:09] the bible says now the children of ruben
[2:14:14] and the children of god
[2:14:16] had a very great multitude of water
[2:14:20] as israel was coming out of egypt
[2:14:24] you okay now follow me very carefully
[2:14:26] among the 14 tribes
[2:14:29] there were two tribes
[2:14:31] that looked strange
[2:14:34] it was the tribe of reuben
[2:14:37] and the tribe of god
[2:14:39] when the tribe of joseph
[2:14:42] got into the business of caddo they were
[2:14:45] not prospering good
[2:14:49] follow me very carefully
[2:14:51] when the tribe of judah worked on caddo
[2:14:55] they were not prospering good
[2:14:58] but when the tribe of rubin got into
[2:15:00] caddo
[2:15:01] their cattle were always multiplying
[2:15:05] when you go to the tribe of god their
[2:15:08] cuddle will also multiply it seems like
[2:15:11] those two tribes have a special gift
[2:15:15] to handle cattle
[2:15:17] and they were prospering on caddo more
[2:15:19] than any other trouble
[2:15:21] follow me carefully
[2:15:24] these two tribes had a very great
[2:15:27] multitude of cattle
[2:15:29] and when they saw the land of water
[2:15:33] jezer and the land of water
[2:15:35] that behold the place was a place for
[2:15:38] water
[2:15:41] israel
[2:15:43] was supposed to leave egypt
[2:15:45] and go straight to the promised land do
[2:15:48] you follow me
[2:15:49] because of their sin god took them to a
[2:15:52] detour
[2:15:54] everybody here instead of going straight
[2:15:57] 35 they got them on 485
[2:16:00] everybody clear and they begin to go in
[2:16:02] a circle to get to the exit
[2:16:04] are you there does it make sense so when
[2:16:07] they begin to go they're reaching to
[2:16:09] this place
[2:16:13] you okay the land of jezebel
[2:16:16] everybody here but the promised land
[2:16:19] they have to cross the river water
[2:16:22] with joshua
[2:16:25] to enter into the promised land
[2:16:27] everybody here but when they got here
[2:16:30] they found this region again
[2:16:34] this region that sharp lot
[2:16:38] here that the region was again fatal
[2:16:43] very good for what for carol
[2:16:46] they demanded and god already told them
[2:16:50] that in the promised land i would take
[2:16:53] care of caddo
[2:16:57] we okay now
[2:16:58] but they found another region outside of
[2:17:02] the promised land that is good also for
[2:17:05] caddo
[2:17:06] [Music]
[2:17:09] are we okay
[2:17:11] so the children of god and the children
[2:17:14] of reuben came and spoke unto moses and
[2:17:17] to eliezer the priest and unto the
[2:17:20] princes of the congregation saying
[2:17:22] atheros and dibon and jezer and nimra
[2:17:26] and heshborne and elilah and shibam and
[2:17:30] nebo and beyond even the country which
[2:17:33] the lord smote before the congregation
[2:17:35] of israel is a land of water
[2:17:38] and that servant have water
[2:17:42] moses and the answer
[2:17:45] everything that we see here
[2:17:47] it looks good for carol
[2:17:50] and we have cara
[2:17:54] so what is your decision
[2:17:56] moses look okay so what
[2:17:59] we're going to the promised land what is
[2:18:01] wrong
[2:18:02] he said
[2:18:03] and where for satay if we have found
[2:18:07] water
[2:18:08] in
[2:18:10] let this land be given
[2:18:13] unto the servant for possession and
[2:18:16] bring us
[2:18:18] over water
[2:18:22] a country of honey and milk a country
[2:18:26] where the lord is dead 360 today a
[2:18:29] country that received where a country
[2:18:32] that have iron a country that had brass
[2:18:34] a country where you're going to have
[2:18:35] houses you didn't build a country that
[2:18:38] you're gonna have houses that god filled
[2:18:40] for you a country that you're gonna have
[2:18:42] well that you didn't dig
[2:18:45] this
[2:18:46] that they saw here
[2:18:47] made them reject the whole land of
[2:18:50] israel
[2:18:52] they say this is better for us
[2:18:54] please we don't want the promised land
[2:19:00] the region of the gallery
[2:19:02] hey
[2:19:04] the bible continued and they came near
[2:19:07] unto him and say we will build water
[2:19:14] did they say we will build peak fold
[2:19:17] so they were raising water
[2:19:20] are we okay
[2:19:22] at that time they were raising good
[2:19:25] thing
[2:19:28] four here our cattle
[2:19:32] we will build shift here for alcado and
[2:19:35] cities for our little one but we ourself
[2:19:38] will go ready army before the children
[2:19:40] of israel
[2:19:41] until we have brought them unto their
[2:19:44] place and our little one shall dwell in
[2:19:46] defence cities because of the inhabitant
[2:19:48] of the land
[2:19:50] moses was angry he says you want to
[2:19:52] discourage the people we're almost there
[2:19:55] and you want to stay out
[2:19:57] so you cross against the congregation to
[2:19:58] sin they say no moses you don't
[2:20:00] understand
[2:20:01] we're going to build
[2:20:02] city here
[2:20:03] we're going to build everything our wife
[2:20:05] our children are going to stay out of
[2:20:07] the promised land
[2:20:09] we're going to go with you
[2:20:11] with our weapon and help our brother to
[2:20:14] find their position when they find their
[2:20:17] position in the promised land then we're
[2:20:20] going to come back out and we're going
[2:20:22] to stay here
[2:20:24] hey
[2:20:25] we will not return on to our houses
[2:20:28] until the children of israel have
[2:20:31] inherited every man his inheritance they
[2:20:34] become helpers
[2:20:36] they can start with you to build you up
[2:20:39] unto a certain place and after a while
[2:20:41] they will pull off because they don't
[2:20:44] want to go with what you have
[2:20:50] [Music]
[2:20:52] come on
[2:20:56] we will not
[2:20:58] inherit with them on the underside
[2:21:02] jordan
[2:21:04] all forward because our inheritance is
[2:21:07] fallen to us on this side of jordan
[2:21:10] where
[2:21:11] who taught them that was their
[2:21:13] inheritance
[2:21:17] and moses said unto them if the children
[2:21:20] of god and the children of reuben will
[2:21:22] pass over with you over jordan every man
[2:21:25] armed to battle because moses have a
[2:21:27] different ministry he have to even give
[2:21:29] them the letter of divorce
[2:21:31] because he knew as much i can preach
[2:21:33] preach preach they still want to get
[2:21:34] married to that woman just let them go
[2:21:37] are you there before the lord and their
[2:21:39] land shall be subdued before you then
[2:21:41] you shall give them the land of guilt
[2:21:44] for possession
[2:21:45] everybody here
[2:21:47] but if they will not pass over with you
[2:21:50] arm
[2:21:51] they shall have possession among you
[2:21:53] into the land of what
[2:21:55] moses say
[2:21:56] if they help you
[2:21:58] you can let them leave the promised land
[2:22:00] and go back but if they don't help you
[2:22:03] they're going to have their possession
[2:22:04] where
[2:22:06] in other words these two tribes have
[2:22:10] their property in canaan
[2:22:14] they had their predestination property
[2:22:17] in canaan
[2:22:18] but they didn't want that property they
[2:22:21] say we stay out moses say if you don't
[2:22:24] help them you're going to go
[2:22:26] automatically by force you're going to
[2:22:28] go there
[2:22:29] you know what they did they made sure
[2:22:31] they went
[2:22:33] and they help everybody and they pull
[2:22:34] back
[2:22:38] i don't want to go through much
[2:22:39] scripture but you can read it later
[2:22:41] everybody clear
[2:22:43] brother branham said in the message as i
[2:22:46] was with moses and when this great thing
[2:22:48] taken place when each one of these
[2:22:51] hebrew mothers
[2:22:53] in the travailing in the childbirth
[2:22:56] call out like water
[2:22:59] so brother branham say when the hebrew
[2:23:02] mother were giving birth to their
[2:23:04] children
[2:23:05] as they're pushing the child out
[2:23:07] you want to hear the mother goes robin
[2:23:12] and when that word come out
[2:23:16] something is in that word
[2:23:19] somebody who's in the promised land
[2:23:22] heard an earthquake
[2:23:24] what is going on a mother thundered
[2:23:28] somewhere
[2:23:32] they were traveling in childbirth call
[2:23:34] out like robin
[2:23:36] that placed him
[2:23:38] positionally in water
[2:23:41] so the name of the tribe was
[2:23:44] automatically connected to the position
[2:23:47] in the promised land
[2:23:51] are you there
[2:23:53] exactly the way that mother said and
[2:23:56] call his name
[2:23:58] said it i don't have it all written down
[2:24:00] here wrote down here but say rubens
[2:24:03] means water
[2:24:05] do you understand why those tribes have
[2:24:07] a lot of sheep
[2:24:09] [Music]
[2:24:11] so their gift came by birth
[2:24:18] amen everybody
[2:24:20] predestinated by god
[2:24:23] to flourish
[2:24:27] god means water
[2:24:30] do you understand why those three tribes
[2:24:32] were prospering
[2:24:35] you can work work work you won't work
[2:24:37] like them they don't work too much they
[2:24:39] work a little bit and they keep flowing
[2:24:41] about here
[2:24:43] and ephraim means water
[2:24:46] that's why ephraim could not raise caddo
[2:24:49] about here and by spiritual discernment
[2:24:52] joshua the new leader by spiritual
[2:24:55] discernment placed each one where he
[2:24:57] belongs divided the land just water
[2:25:01] god gave this tribe a gift
[2:25:07] to prosper
[2:25:08] with the cuddle but those gifts
[2:25:12] in order to prosper right
[2:25:15] must be placed in the promised land
[2:25:19] [Music]
[2:25:22] that's why gift and calling are without
[2:25:26] repentance
[2:25:29] you are born with it
[2:25:31] but for your gift to work right
[2:25:34] you must be in the world
[2:25:45] in a message adoption brother branham
[2:25:48] say the church positionally
[2:25:51] before the foundation of the world
[2:25:54] when god in water
[2:25:59] you remember that in eternity
[2:26:01] when that pillar of fire came out
[2:26:03] and he won a breath because when he go
[2:26:05] he's carrying his children when he go
[2:26:07] he's carrying his children god says
[2:26:10] they're praying too much over there
[2:26:12] let me give them more space
[2:26:15] and god begin to buff you
[2:26:22] when god in his labor pain
[2:26:25] was bringing forth you
[2:26:29] knowing what she would do
[2:26:31] he positionally pledged you into his own
[2:26:35] water
[2:26:39] so when you come in this world
[2:26:42] there is something in your life
[2:26:44] that is already built in you

[2:28:05] spirit of god whereby you are sealed
[2:28:08] until the day of your

[2:28:14] he said and all the people there will be
[2:28:16] million times a million that will walk
[2:28:18] very religiously and be deceived the
[2:28:21] only one that will not be deceived will
[2:28:24] be those that have come over into the
