[13:53] and uh if you want to come give that
[13:55] help
[14:00] god bless you
[14:02] um
[14:04] last sunday service as some may notice
[14:07] when i was sitting there
[14:09] i couldn't really i was in pain i was
[14:11] feeling pain around my body i could
[14:13] barely stand up so when i got up i went
[14:16] outside and i was still in pain
[14:19] and
[14:20] always anything everything that was
[14:21] going on my mind was asking god to help
[14:24] me and when i asked god
[14:26] to send someone to help me when i was
[14:28] outside by myself it it did a deacon
[14:31] came and
[14:32] he brought me inside
[14:34] and when right before when the service
[14:37] ended the pastor was preaching um the
[14:40] pastor came and he started praying for
[14:42] me and everybody else that was there
[14:43] also started praying i started felt
[14:45] feeling my pain started to multiply
[14:48] multiply and my pain got extremely bad
[14:51] then all of a sudden i felt something
[14:54] in my stomach just dropped
[14:56] then after church we went to the
[14:58] emergency
[15:01] um
[15:02] based on
[15:03] what everybody else was telling me i
[15:05] could have ended up having a surgery
[15:07] but each time i kept drinking water and
[15:09] can't go into the bathroom the pain kept
[15:12] getting lighter and lighter
[15:14] and i wasn't feeling pain each time i
[15:16] went
[15:17] at first i couldn't even get up
[15:19] when i went to the emergency
[15:21] but
[15:22] as time went by when i was praying in my
[15:24] heart
[15:25] jesus made it so my pain can diminish
[15:28] little by little until the point where
[15:30] they did um a test on my blood
[15:34] on my urine and everything and
[15:36] everything came out negative i only had
[15:38] one issue but that wasn't something
[15:41] it wasn't a big deal
[15:43] so
[15:44] i stayed inside the hospital
[15:47] since service was done all the way till
[15:50] midnight
[15:52] but
[15:53] it took them forever before they can
[15:55] call me so i can go over there and so
[15:57] they can treat me and so they can tell
[15:58] me what i have but thanks to the lord
[16:01] god he's he helped me while they were
[16:04] busy helping other people he put me
[16:06] first while they were helping other
[16:07] people
[16:08] so i just want to thank god for that
[16:10] because he spared me from having to take
[16:12] surgeries and i want to thank everybody
[16:14] else who kept me in prayers
[16:19] amen
[16:21] brother freddie could you come least in
[16:22] a word of prayer this evening i didn't
[16:24] receive any written request yeah brother
[16:26] freddie sister
[16:36] um
[16:52] amen pray for traveling mercy's there
[16:55] did anybody else have a pr unspoken
[16:57] request
[17:06] amen
[17:08] we believe god can heal through surgery
[17:10] but we also believe he can heal without
[17:11] surgery so and we like that option
[17:14] better it's cheaper and easier right
[17:17] so uh if anybody has a prayer request on
[17:19] their heart this evening they could just
[17:20] make it known by the uplifting of their
[17:22] hand an unspoken request
[18:50] you all may be seated as they come
[18:53] angela
[18:55] you know i'm grateful for uh
[18:57] to be in church this evening and and i
[18:59] say that almost every wednesday but i
[19:01] see
[19:02] a lot of churches are canceling again
[19:04] and they're starting to
[19:05] go remote or they had meetings scheduled
[19:08] and they cancel them because it's like
[19:09] the new wave of coveted and different
[19:11] things and i'm grateful to be able to
[19:13] gather together with my brothers and
[19:14] sisters and to have service so i'm happy
[19:17] to be here

[36:27] to our scripture tonight
[36:30] i believe the kids are out of school
[36:32] right
[36:33] so no pressure
[36:34] amen
[36:36] amen let's go to first samuel
[36:43] amen
[36:43] [Laughter]
[36:49] chapter 22 how many are up to date with
[36:52] the sermon let me see your hand
[36:57] okay okay amen
[36:59] if you're missing something
[37:02] i am not to blame
[37:05] it's on youtube amen yeah because
[37:08] everything we're going through now it's
[37:11] building
[37:12] one after the other in other words if
[37:14] you miss one you're gonna have a trouble
[37:16] on the second one if you miss three
[37:18] three four three four five sermon then
[37:20] you really really really really in
[37:21] trouble amen
[37:23] then you'll be sitting here and
[37:25] wondering what are we talking about
[37:27] first samuel chapter 22 if you're there
[37:29] you can say amen
[37:32] david
[37:33] we know about david right
[37:35] about the temple and the priesthood and
[37:38] everything now you're already clear
[37:40] david therefore departed from there
[37:44] and escaped to the cave a dylan
[37:48] and when his brethren
[37:50] and all his father's house heard it
[37:53] they went down there to him you might be
[37:56] seated
[37:57] so we found david here
[37:59] escaped from seoul
[38:02] and there is something strange about
[38:04] david that we already spoke about it we
[38:06] know that the priesthood came through
[38:09] the lineage of liver
[38:11] but for some reason we seen david
[38:13] behaving
[38:14] in a different way david went and built
[38:17] the temple and god didn't do anything
[38:19] against that david went and then ate the
[38:22] showbread nothing happened
[38:25] and later on down the road you will
[38:26] notice that david also went and wore
[38:29] even the line and effort in other words
[38:31] he went and put up the priestly garment
[38:35] and nothing happened to him
[38:37] amen
[38:38] what is wrong with david
[38:40] because the priest should come through
[38:42] liver but this is a man from judah amen
[38:44] but in the new testament when we went
[38:46] through melchizedek we found out that
[38:48] the priesthood would have to come
[38:50] through judah amen
[38:52] now we understand what's going on so
[38:55] david here departed from israel
[38:58] when he escaped from israel the bible
[39:00] says that his brethren
[39:02] and all his father house heard it and
[39:04] they went down there to him verse two
[39:08] and everyone that was in water
[39:12] not everybody that was healthy
[39:17] everybody here
[39:18] everybody that was in distress
[39:21] come out
[39:22] and everyone that was in depth
[39:28] were you in debt before
[39:31] were you in debt
[39:33] you thought you were not in debt because
[39:35] you don't owe the bank
[39:36] you had a big big big debt that you owe
[39:40] and you could not pay
[39:43] you needed someone to take care of that
[39:45] debt
[39:46] amen
[39:48] so everybody that was in debt come on
[39:51] and everyone that was discontent
[39:55] in other words bitterness of soul
[39:59] bitterness
[40:02] of soul
[40:03] everybody that was not happy discontent
[40:06] amen
[40:08] gather themselves to him
[40:10] and he became a captain over them
[40:14] and they were
[40:15] with him about
[40:17] 400
[40:18] men so beside his family
[40:22] some other people came in
[40:24] but it seems like everybody that
[40:27] followed david was in trouble
[40:32] everybody here
[40:33] everybody
[40:35] amen you will think it's healthy people
[40:38] it's people that are wealthy people that
[40:40] don't have any problem people that have
[40:43] 800 points in their credit score

[46:17] answer
[46:18] ever here
[46:20] everybody here we don't want to put out
[46:23] something from israel amen so when he
[46:26] departed
[46:28] because the anointing of god already
[46:30] left soul
[46:32] okay that anointing was put on david
[46:35] anybody here then an evil spirit went to
[46:38] seoul
[46:39] and back here
[46:41] so when that anointing was put on god
[46:44] was going with david
[46:46] so now that anointing of the king left
[46:48] israel
[46:50] the kingly anointing
[46:54] hey america
[46:56] the king of the jews
[46:57] his anointing left israel and as his
[47:00] anointing is going out

[47:05] amen
[47:06] love that anointing amen
[47:09] matthew chapter 9 verse 9 amen
[47:14] and as jesus passed forth from there
[47:18] he saw a man named matthew
[47:21] sitting at the receipt of custom in
[47:24] other words in a tax office
[47:27] and he says to him
[47:29] follow me
[47:30] and he arose and followed him
[47:33] verse 10
[47:34] and he came to pass
[47:36] as jesus sat at meat he said a table to
[47:40] eat everybody
[47:41] start to eat as jesus sat and meet in
[47:45] the house
[47:46] behold
[47:48] few publicans
[47:51] somebody's awake thank god how many
[47:54] republican
[47:55] [Music]
[47:57] many publicans
[48:01] many publicly
[48:03] publicans are good people right
[48:07] you need to raise your bible
[48:08] [Laughter]
[48:10] many publicans
[48:13] and christians came
[48:20] a message has already been preached
[48:23] many publicans and who
[48:25] [Music]
[48:27] what is in jesus that attracted these
[48:30] guys
[48:30] [Music]
[48:32] many publicans
[48:34] and sinners
[48:36] came and sat down with him and his
[48:39] disciple
[48:41] so when you look at him
[48:44] you say that's god in human flesh
[48:48] so when you look around god in human
[48:50] flesh
[48:52] you hardly see christian
[48:57] you see the people that rob you
[48:59] the people that lied
[49:01] the people that cheated
[49:03] the people that were prosecuted
[49:05] [Music]
[49:08] amen is this really a holy man
[49:12] amen
[49:15] amen
[49:16] and when the pharisee
[49:19] in the message saw it
[49:22] they say to his disciple i say to the
[49:25] message don't say but it's even added
[49:27] because somebody's looking for trouble
[49:29] when the pharisee saw it
[49:32] they say to his disciple
[49:34] why
[49:35] eat your master
[49:37] with publicans
[49:39] and sinners
[49:42] can a priest
[49:44] eat with a publican
[49:47] based on description
[49:50] can a levat eat with publicans
[49:54] there's only one person
[49:58] remember we're in the good samaritan
[50:02] amen
[50:03] only one person can approach him
[50:06] nobody else anybody here
[50:08] why eat your master with
[50:11] and sinners
[50:13] but when jesus heard that
[50:15] he said to them
[50:17] day that be whole
[50:21] in other words the people that are
[50:23] healthy
[50:26] everybody here
[50:27] they that behold
[50:30] need not a physician
[50:32] in other words the healthy people do not
[50:35] go to the doctor
[50:37] amen
[50:38] but dead that are water
[50:41] so according to jesus publican and
[50:44] sinners are sick people
[50:47] people in trouble
[50:49] hey mark here
[50:52] verse 13. but go you and learn
[50:57] what that means
[50:59] i will have
[51:00] mercy mercy
[51:04] this is a scripture jesus is telling
[51:06] them
[51:06] go to the old testament
[51:09] and open the old testament if you search
[51:11] the old testament in hosea chapter 6
[51:15] verse 6
[51:16] i gave you the scripture
[51:18] you will see over there there is a
[51:20] scripture that hosea the prophet said
[51:22] and hosea said ever here i will have
[51:25] mercy
[51:26] and not water
[51:28] there is two things here one of them is
[51:31] mercy
[51:33] hey marquee
[51:34] versus sacrifice
[51:37] anybody care
[51:38] sacrifice is speaking about the law
[51:42] are we okay
[51:44] which is speaking about the levitical
[51:46] priesthood
[51:51] showing you that this priesthood
[51:54] is already in trouble
[51:56] because christ came
[51:58] amen
[51:59] i will have mercy and not sacrifice
[52:03] for sacrifice for i am not come to call
[52:07] the who
[52:09] but who
[52:11] to water
[52:13] [Music]
[52:16] amen
[52:17] my ministry
[52:19] when i'm moving
[52:21] i'm there to catch sinners
[52:24] people that are in trouble
[52:26] those are the people that follow david
[52:30] amen
[52:32] let's go to luke chapter 10.
[52:35] this is our man scripture
[52:37] and i'm going to read portion of it
[52:38] because that's where we're going to try
[52:40] to reach tonight
[52:41] if you're there you can say amen
[52:44] look chapter 10 verse 30.
[52:48] amen
[52:52] hallelujah
[52:54] and jesus answering say
[52:57] a certain man you remember this on
[52:59] sunday
[53:00] went down he was not going up
[53:03] because when you going up you are
[53:04] progressing
[53:06] right when you're moving from level one
[53:08] to level two level three all the way
[53:10] we're saying that you are growing up
[53:13] but this man is kind of backsliding
[53:16] going backward
[53:19] a man was going down from jerusalem to
[53:22] jericho
[53:23] and fell among thieves you remember
[53:25] sunday
[53:26] which number one strip him of his when
[53:29] men
[53:30] come out and wounded him come on and
[53:34] departed leaving him half dead remember
[53:36] sunday
[53:38] and by chance
[53:40] there came down a certain priest
[53:43] you remember now
[53:45] remember sunday
[53:46] a certain priest that way
[53:49] and when he saw him he passed by on the
[53:51] other side a marquee
[53:54] and likewise a leaver
[53:57] we have a priest now
[54:00] and a leaver
[54:02] you remember on sunday now right
[54:04] you know who is a priest who is a leaver
[54:06] and a leaver likewise when he was at the
[54:09] place came and looked on him
[54:11] and passed by on the other side
[54:15] but
[54:16] a certain samaritan
[54:19] amen
[54:20] why is samaritan
[54:23] the first group is a christian oliver
[54:26] the second group
[54:28] the second man that came in is the
[54:30] samaritan because the priest and the
[54:32] levite behave the same way
[54:35] their behavior
[54:37] ever care
[54:40] was the same
[54:43] this look go to the other side look go
[54:45] to the ass they repeated the same thing
[54:47] amen
[54:49] but a certain samaritan as he journey
[54:53] came where he was
[54:55] and when he saw him he had
[54:59] compassion on him
[55:02] what is compassion
[55:07] amen
[55:09] this man no mercy
[55:12] no mercy
[55:13] but this one
[55:15] shows compassion there is something in
[55:18] this man
[55:19] that attract him
[55:21] to bad cases
[55:24] but these two
[55:25] don't handle bad cases
[55:28] this one
[55:29] love bad cases
[55:32] this one
[55:33] love bad cases
[55:36] amen in other words when it's a mess
[55:39] that's when
[55:41] his anointing begin to work
[55:46] did you hear me when everything is fine
[55:51] he's choked
[55:55] [Music]
[55:56] brother branham said god love to display
[55:59] his power
[56:01] [Applause]
[56:02] amen
[56:04] here
[56:05] brother branham said he usually
[56:08] was had a tendency to take his children
[56:11] and put him on his lap and then he
[56:13] showed them his muscles and they say
[56:15] look daddy you have big muscles but i'm
[56:18] saying he loved that everybody
[56:20] and he said god also wanted to show his
[56:24] muscles
[56:25] but to show myself they got to be a
[56:27] fight
[56:29] so when fight comes
[56:31] then god is jumping
[56:36] because it's an opportunity for him
[56:40] to display his power
[56:44] [Music]
[56:46] why should i give you a healing
[56:47] anointing when you see you're here
[56:49] when you are healthy
[56:52] anybody here
[56:54] wait when brother jm get sick then when
[56:58] the lord heal him
[57:00] you will never teach him about divine
[57:02] healing
[57:03] nobody can take that away
[57:05] everybody here he would never knew the
[57:08] power of god in that aspect until
[57:11] troubles come
[57:14] let's pray heavenly father
[57:17] lord once again we are approaching you
[57:19] humbly tonight father thanking you for
[57:22] your grace for your love and your mercy
[57:25] and for everything you have been doing
[57:27] for us
[57:28] father you have given us another
[57:30] opportunity to be here tonight
[57:32] with sense of like precious faith lord
[57:35] father to share the things that belong
[57:38] to the kingdom of god
[57:39] lord we have done everything that a man
[57:42] can do this is the best that i can based
[57:45] on the ability you have given me but
[57:47] when it comes to interpret your word to
[57:50] bless your children and to give a
[57:52] revelation
[57:53] that takes the supernatural act of the
[57:55] holy spirit father therefore i ask that
[57:59] you move me completely out of the way
[58:01] may you come down and you speak to your
[58:03] children bless them and remember the
[58:05] sacrifice they have done father to drive
[58:08] tonight coming to your house wow there
[58:11] could be many reason that could befriend
[58:13] them and make them sit home lord we
[58:16] commit them unto the hand may you be the
[58:18] beginning and the ending do you find the
[58:20] omega of this service father in the name
[58:23] of jesus christ
[58:25] amen
[58:26] god richly bless you we are dealing with
[58:30] the high priest in the good samaritan on
[58:33] sunday that was part one because we
[58:35] could not finish now we are on part two
[58:38] everybody clear
[58:40] we saw on sunday that when we talked
[58:43] about the priesthood
[58:45] we had two lineage in the priesthood
[58:48] we have the natural lineage in the
[58:50] priesthood which was the levitical
[58:52] priesthood el barca
[58:54] and then in the spiritual side we have
[58:57] what we call the melchizedek priesthood
[59:00] every case so far
[59:03] we establish on sunday based on the
[59:05] scripture
[59:06] that the levitical priesthood have
[59:09] priests
[59:10] which is from which are from the lineage
[59:13] of aaron amen and leave that
[59:16] which were giving to aaron as an
[59:19] offering to help him
[59:22] so they leave out were the helpers of
[59:25] the priest
[59:26] and we say that every priest is a leaver
[59:30] remember that
[59:31] but every level is not a priest because
[59:35] to be priest number one you must be a
[59:37] leaver and number two you must come from
[59:40] the lineage of aaron alone if you are
[59:43] from another family you are still a
[59:45] levite you can help into the tabernacle
[59:48] but you are not a priest
[59:50] ever here so far
[59:52] now we moved and we saw that first of
[59:55] all god wanted the entire nation of
[59:58] israel to be preached then god pulled
[1:00:01] the firstborn from there and because of
[1:00:03] the sin of israel god rejected the
[1:00:06] firstborn and went into the family of
[1:00:08] liver and then pulled from there the
[1:00:11] priesthood
[1:00:12] so going with the natural lineage we
[1:00:15] have israel first that was given the
[1:00:18] chance then from israel he moved to the
[1:00:21] family of liver and back here then
[1:00:24] inside the family of liver he pulled
[1:00:28] aaron
[1:00:29] amen ever here so from israel they pull
[1:00:32] liver from liver they pull aaron and
[1:00:35] aaron became the first high priest
[1:00:38] amen ever here which was a type of jesus
[1:00:41] christ
[1:00:42] ever care so far
[1:00:45] in psalm chapter 1 37 uh chapter 135
[1:00:50] the bible says this in verse 19

[1:01:17] he need worship
[1:01:19] and god is bringing a commandment
[1:01:21] and when he's bringing the commandment
[1:01:24] he said you house of israel ever care
[1:01:28] bless the lord
[1:01:31] and back here
[1:01:32] are you in israel
[1:01:34] are you a jew
[1:01:37] then he move on he said house of who
[1:01:41] aaron
[1:01:43] bless the lord
[1:01:45] were you born from the family of aaron
[1:01:48] he turned around he said house of liver
[1:01:52] ever here
[1:01:53] bless the lord
[1:01:55] [Music]
[1:01:56] bless the lord house of israel
[1:01:59] bless the lord house of liver
[1:02:01] bless the lord house of aaron

[1:02:25] here so these three is telling you we
[1:02:28] are dealing with the levitical
[1:02:30] priesthood
[1:02:32] but there is another priesthood
[1:02:34] which is the priesthood of melchizedek
[1:02:37] and the mercedes-area there is no jews
[1:02:41] and there is no gender
[1:02:44] ever here melchizedek works with
[1:02:47] predestination
[1:02:50] as long as you have a predestination
[1:02:53] seed
[1:02:54] it doesn't matter whether you are a jew
[1:02:57] whether you are an american whether you
[1:02:59] are an african whether you are a

[1:03:08] merchandiser that goes by the spiritual
[1:03:11] bloodline
[1:03:12] the predestinated seed that was planted
[1:03:16] in you before the foundation of the
[1:03:18] world
[1:03:20] ever here so bless the lord have of

[1:03:43] so right here you can see the two
[1:03:45] priesthood locked ready
[1:03:48] and the opening of the seven seal the
[1:03:51] bible became a new book
[1:03:54] in acts 2 verse 5 the bible says
[1:03:58] and they were dwelling in jerusalem jews
[1:04:02] devout men god fearing men everybody
[1:04:06] out of water
[1:04:10] out of every nation under heaven
[1:04:15] so under heaven out of every nation jews
[1:04:18] were scattered already
[1:04:21] so they came for the feast
[1:04:24] now when this was noise abroad when the
[1:04:26] holy ghost came on the day of pentecost
[1:04:29] the multitude came together and were
[1:04:32] confounded
[1:04:33] because that every man heard them speak
[1:04:36] in his own language
[1:04:39] so some of the jews departed from israel
[1:04:43] they went into gentile country
[1:04:46] and the children were born there and
[1:04:48] when those children were born they were
[1:04:50] jew by blood
[1:04:53] but the language that they grew up with
[1:04:56] was no more the jewish language it was
[1:04:59] the language of the country that they
[1:05:00] were born in
[1:05:02] everybody so far
[1:05:04] and all
[1:05:05] they were um and they were all amazed
[1:05:08] and marveled saying one to another
[1:05:10] behold are not all these which speak
[1:05:13] galileans
[1:05:14] these are true jews
[1:05:17] everybody here
[1:05:18] and how
[1:05:20] here we every man in our own tongue
[1:05:23] where when we were born that's the
[1:05:25] country they were born
[1:05:27] portion
[1:05:28] and midis illamites and the dwellers is
[1:05:31] made in mesopotamia and in judea in
[1:05:35] cappadocia in pontus and asia francia
[1:05:38] pamphilia in egypt in the part of libya
[1:05:42] which is in africa about sarin in africa
[1:05:46] and strangers of rome
[1:05:48] jews and who
[1:05:51] a proselyte is a gentile that have
[1:05:54] believed the jewish religion
[1:05:56] anybody
[1:05:58] no problem and queen is an arabian we do
[1:06:02] hear them speak in our tongue the
[1:06:04] wonderful work of who
[1:06:06] [Music]
[1:06:08] at the beginning
[1:06:10] over there everybody spoke one language
[1:06:14] everybody okay
[1:06:15] we came from adam and dada may even even
[1:06:18] go back fourth and fourth and set all
[1:06:21] the way there everybody spoke one
[1:06:23] language
[1:06:25] so when god brought the flood
[1:06:27] and destroyed the entire world ever here
[1:06:31] after that noah came out from the ark
[1:06:34] and noah was speaking one language with
[1:06:37] his entire family then from now the
[1:06:40] earth began to multiply again
[1:06:42] so nimrod came
[1:06:44] and the nimrod came with the idea that
[1:06:47] maybe one day again if we do something
[1:06:50] that is wrong god is going to punish us
[1:06:53] again with the flood
[1:06:54] and brother branham said that's why he
[1:06:56] came up with a plan to build the tower
[1:07:00] of battle in order that when the flood
[1:07:02] comes everybody will go into the tower
[1:07:05] climb up there and when the flood is
[1:07:06] finished we become back against sinner
[1:07:09] you go up sinner you come back sooner
[1:07:11] and god haraf is going to destroy is not
[1:07:13] going to reach you everybody here
[1:07:15] so when god look at the unity of man
[1:07:20] a wrong unity to accomplish something
[1:07:23] god came
[1:07:25] and confronted the language
[1:07:28] everybody here
[1:07:29] so you can speak
[1:07:31] you think you are speaking
[1:07:34] in your language but the one who's
[1:07:36] understanding you is understanding
[1:07:39] another language
[1:07:40] everybody here in other words god
[1:07:43] disturb
[1:07:44] the interpretation amen
[1:07:47] i'm going slowly
[1:07:49] are we okay
[1:07:50] are we okay because there was a false
[1:07:53] unity
[1:07:55] under a force head which brought
[1:07:58] confusion and it was something that was
[1:08:00] against the word of god
[1:08:02] but on the day of pentecost
[1:08:05] because jesus said it is expedient for
[1:08:08] me to go because if i stay here i cannot
[1:08:12] send the holy ghost back into you i
[1:08:14] cannot send melchizedek back into you
[1:08:17] ever here when melchizedek came there
[1:08:20] ever here when merchandise enter into
[1:08:24] the disciple
[1:08:25] you don't need the translation anymore
[1:08:30] amen
[1:08:30] ever here
[1:08:32] the disciples were speaking in galileans
[1:08:36] everybody but when they speak in english
[1:08:40] the one whose understanding does not
[1:08:43] understand english
[1:08:45] he is understanding english translated
[1:08:49] by the holy ghost
[1:08:51] in their own language
[1:08:58] that's why if you die today
[1:09:01] and you go to the sixth dimension don't
[1:09:04] worry about english if you don't speak
[1:09:06] english
[1:09:08] if you see brother branham there you
[1:09:10] won't need the translation over there
[1:09:12] [Music]
[1:09:15] ever here you will be speaking just the
[1:09:18] language you think you are speaking and
[1:09:21] brother branham will hear you just as
[1:09:23] you speak in english
[1:09:25] [Applause]
[1:09:26] [Music]
[1:09:28] oh my god
[1:09:30] blessed be the name of the lord brother
[1:09:32] branham say and then division left
[1:09:37] he had a patient a spanish lady
[1:09:39] and the little girl turned to the
[1:09:41] interpreter
[1:09:42] and said in spanish
[1:09:44] i thought he could not speak
[1:09:46] spanish so brother branham had a girl
[1:09:49] sitting there speaking spanish and
[1:09:51] brother branham had an interpreter so
[1:09:53] brother branham was speaking to the
[1:09:55] interpreter and the vision broke
[1:09:57] and brother branham was sucked into the
[1:09:59] vision completely
[1:10:01] and when brother branham got into the
[1:10:03] vision under the anointing of the holy
[1:10:05] spirit brother branham began to speak in
[1:10:08] spanish
[1:10:09] everybody
[1:10:11] but the interpreter of brother branham
[1:10:14] heard brother i'm speaking in english
[1:10:19] do you hear me amen
[1:10:21] are we okay
[1:10:22] about the spanish girl heard brother
[1:10:25] branham speaking in spanish
[1:10:28] then the girl turned to the interpreters
[1:10:30] say wait a minute i thought you told me
[1:10:32] the prophet doesn't speak spanish
[1:10:39] jesus christ the same yesterday today
[1:10:44] and forever
[1:10:47] ever here
[1:10:51] now you understand the background i
[1:10:53] thought he could not speak spanish
[1:10:55] and the interpreters say you spoke
[1:10:58] english didn't you brother branham
[1:11:01] i said i did he said well she said you
[1:11:04] spoke spanish
[1:11:07] i said brother branham stop the recorder
[1:11:10] anybody here all along the road and they
[1:11:14] stop and we play it back and every word
[1:11:18] was
[1:11:22] and then
[1:11:23] we had her to repeat what i said
[1:11:26] when they listen to the tape english
[1:11:29] they say wait a minute
[1:11:31] you say you heard me speaking in spanish
[1:11:33] right
[1:11:34] sit down there write everything that i
[1:11:36] spoke in spanish
[1:11:38] anybody here and then we heard her to
[1:11:41] repeat what i said
[1:11:43] and as long as the vision was going on
[1:11:47] she heard every word in water
[1:11:50] why
[1:11:51] i hear we every man in our own tongue
[1:11:54] where when we were
[1:11:56] in other words back again to pentecost
[1:11:59] god is still god
[1:12:02] now when i begin to say word within
[1:12:04] myself she didn't understand that at all
[1:12:08] but the holy spirit
[1:12:11] speaking english
[1:12:12] was interpreting it to her in what
[1:12:17] god is good
[1:12:19] he's a good god as aura robert blessed
[1:12:23] certainly is water
[1:12:25] so if you have a problem with
[1:12:27] translation go back to that god
[1:12:30] he is still in power to open your ears
[1:12:34] to open your heart so you can understand
[1:12:37] the language of god
[1:12:39] [Applause]
[1:12:41] everybody here
[1:12:43] you won't you don't have to worry in the
[1:12:45] rapture when we meet one another in a
[1:12:47] rapture you will be talking a language
[1:12:50] and abraham will hear you
[1:12:52] jacob we hear you jesus we hear you
[1:12:55] brother branham we hear you because the
[1:12:57] language that unity is back again under
[1:13:00] the headship of the holy spirit ever
[1:13:03] cares for that is the image of
[1:13:06] melchizedek and everybody that was in
[1:13:08] jerusalem feared god
[1:13:13] and back here there were jews and they
[1:13:16] were also gentile in act 10 first one
[1:13:19] there was a certain man in caesarea
[1:13:22] called cornelius a gentile a centurion
[1:13:25] of the band called the italian man
[1:13:29] a devout man
[1:13:31] and one day of the water
[1:13:34] was he a jew
[1:13:36] yeah fear god
[1:13:39] praise the lord
[1:13:40] hey back here
[1:13:42] under melchizedek you have jews
[1:13:45] and you have also who
[1:13:47] you have gentiles ever here
[1:13:49] and the man filled god with all his
[1:13:52] house which gave much arm to the people
[1:13:55] and prayed to god always a gentile man
[1:14:00] everybody here
[1:14:02] now in hebrew on sunday we stopped here
[1:14:05] we found out that paul said but year
[1:14:08] come unto mount zion and unto the city
[1:14:12] of the living god the heavenly jerusalem
[1:14:15] not the earthly
[1:14:17] the heavenly because melchizedek is king
[1:14:19] of jerusalem
[1:14:22] and to an innumerable company of angel
[1:14:25] to the general assembly and the church
[1:14:28] of the first
[1:14:29] remember the priesthood here aaron was
[1:14:33] the firstborn everybody here you
[1:14:35] remember on sunday but on our side on
[1:14:38] melchizedek the firstborn of god the
[1:14:42] beginning of the creation of god was
[1:14:44] jesus christ
[1:14:46] now the church not of the first borns
[1:14:49] plural
[1:14:50] but singular
[1:14:52] the church of the firstborn one
[1:14:55] the firstborn in other words the church
[1:14:58] of jesus christ
[1:15:02] here because jesus is the firstborn he
[1:15:05] is the beginning of the creation of god
[1:15:08] and the firstborn is what god was
[1:15:11] looking for in egypt he said bring me
[1:15:13] the firstborn that's going to be my
[1:15:15] priest here
[1:15:17] now the bible said the church of christ
[1:15:20] or the church of the firstborn which is
[1:15:23] the bread of jesus christ it's a birth
[1:15:25] by a man just like adam gave birth to
[1:15:27] evil ever here by
[1:15:30] another way
[1:15:31] not a natural way so join the church of
[1:15:34] the firstborn comma which are written in
[1:15:38] heaven
[1:15:38] [Music]
[1:15:40] lord help me
[1:15:42] when we say written in heaven what does
[1:15:44] it mean
[1:15:45] the bible said in luke 10 verse 20
[1:15:49] notwithstanding in this rejoice not
[1:15:53] jesus called the disciple
[1:15:55] and gave them the power of unclean
[1:15:56] spirit and he sent them go preach the
[1:15:59] gospel and he sent them including judah
[1:16:03] so they went and began to cast out
[1:16:05] devils and do all kind of miracles so
[1:16:07] when they came back everybody was
[1:16:09] rejoicing lord you know what we see
[1:16:11] miracle devils were going left and right
[1:16:14] and everything they were rejoicing and
[1:16:16] jesus look at them he said i understand
[1:16:19] but let me tell you something do not
[1:16:20] rejoice on this
[1:16:23] about here
[1:16:24] notwithstanding in this rejoice not that
[1:16:27] the spirit has subject unto you that's
[1:16:30] not what is really important because the
[1:16:32] anointing at the end time can do the
[1:16:33] same thing but here lord have we not
[1:16:36] cast devil in your name have we not
[1:16:38] prophesy in your name that's not what is
[1:16:41] matter because somebody can do that and
[1:16:43] go to hell
[1:16:45] that one don't measure on that one
[1:16:47] back here because when nicodemus came to
[1:16:50] jesus christ he said lord we heard we
[1:16:52] know we heard that you are doing all the
[1:16:55] miracles jesus never comment on that he
[1:16:57] looked at him he said you must be born
[1:16:59] again
[1:17:00] don't talk to me about miracle we need
[1:17:02] to talk about the birth about here so he
[1:17:05] said in that the spirit are subject unto
[1:17:08] you we just none but rather we just
[1:17:12] because your name are written well
[1:17:15] in heaven
[1:17:17] brother brother interpret this scripture
[1:17:18] he says
[1:17:20] the book of life is definitely located
[1:17:23] in heaven
[1:17:24] and will appear at the great white
[1:17:26] throne judgment
[1:17:28] in these verses jesus says that their
[1:17:31] name were written in water
[1:17:34] in heaven they were written in the book
[1:17:37] of life
[1:17:38] for that is where names are
[1:17:41] so the book in heaven that contained
[1:17:44] name is the book of life because there
[1:17:46] are many books in heaven but the one
[1:17:49] that keeps the name of the people is the
[1:17:51] book of life so when they say your name
[1:17:53] are written in heaven it doesn't mean
[1:17:56] that when you go to heaven you're going
[1:17:58] to see your name everywhere it's telling
[1:18:00] you that in heaven there is a book and
[1:18:02] the book have name and inside that book
[1:18:05] your name is there
[1:18:07] ever here so brother branham said so the
[1:18:09] book were written in the book the name
[1:18:11] were written in the book of life for
[1:18:13] that is when names are placed
[1:18:15] jesus was speaking to the 70
[1:18:19] verse 17 but he was also speaking to the
[1:18:22] 12 verse 23
[1:18:24] these had all been rejoicing that devils
[1:18:28] were subject to them to them in jesus
[1:18:30] name
[1:18:31] christ with john there was
[1:18:34] rejoice not that spirit are subject to
[1:18:36] you but rather that your name are
[1:18:39] written in heaven where the book of life
[1:18:43] paul branham pulled something now he
[1:18:45] said you will not hear
[1:18:47] that judah was one of those who are
[1:18:50] casting out devils in jesus name
[1:18:54] but we know that he was a devil the son
[1:18:58] of water
[1:19:00] so when we come back here they say to
[1:19:02] the general assembly and the church of
[1:19:06] the firstborn which are written in
[1:19:08] heaven
[1:19:10] but in heaven judah also was written
[1:19:13] there
[1:19:14] is judah part of the church of god
[1:19:16] [Music]
[1:19:18] watch the scripture and to god the judge
[1:19:21] of all
[1:19:22] and the spirit of water
[1:19:25] made water
[1:19:26] so you must be part of the just people
[1:19:30] that god brought unto perfection
[1:19:34] [Music]
[1:19:36] hallelujah
[1:19:37] brother branham say don't you see it is
[1:19:40] the holy ghost brother
[1:19:42] that is when you enter into the finished
[1:19:46] work
[1:19:47] if you have been justified that's all
[1:19:50] right that's good if you've been
[1:19:52] sanctified that's good but when you
[1:19:55] receive the water
[1:19:57] the holy ghost it's a finished work
[1:20:00] and god has completed his plan of
[1:20:03] salvation
[1:20:04] and seal it with the baptism of the
[1:20:07] water
[1:20:08] amen oh my how many believe it
[1:20:13] the holy ghost in every place in the
[1:20:16] bible is a finnish worker and god
[1:20:20] completed his work
[1:20:22] he called his disciple by justification
[1:20:25] he sanctified them in john 17 17 gave
[1:20:28] them power against unclean spirit they
[1:20:31] went out and cast out devils and come
[1:20:33] back rejoicing he said don't rejoice
[1:20:36] because you cast out devils and they are
[1:20:39] subject to you but rejoice that your
[1:20:41] name is written in water
[1:20:43] i want to ask you something now my
[1:20:45] brother
[1:20:46] if your name is written in heaven is
[1:20:48] that still good
[1:20:52] no sir
[1:20:53] no indeed
[1:20:55] judas was right with water
[1:20:58] so your name being written in heaven
[1:21:01] doesn't finish the trouble
[1:21:03] anybody care
[1:21:05] the only way your name can be other
[1:21:08] trouble
[1:21:10] is in the book of life there is two
[1:21:12] sections there is the book of life
[1:21:16] marquee
[1:21:17] and the lamb's book of life
[1:21:20] and the lamb's book of life
[1:21:23] is the section that only contained the
[1:21:26] bride of jesus christ america so having
[1:21:30] your name in heaven that fan by having
[1:21:33] your name in the lamb's book of life
[1:21:37] it is telling you that you came out of
[1:21:40] jesus christ ever here so far
[1:21:43] blessed be the name of the lord he said
[1:21:46] to the general assembly the church of
[1:21:48] the firstborn the church of jesus christ
[1:21:51] which is the brother ever here how do
[1:21:53] you enter into that brother
[1:21:56] hebrew are ephesian too
[1:21:59] for through him jesus christ
[1:22:02] we have both accessed by water
[1:22:05] one spirit unto the water now therefore
[1:22:08] you are normal stranger and foreigner
[1:22:10] but fellow citizen with the saint and of
[1:22:13] the household of water
[1:22:14] you're getting the spirit of god that's
[1:22:17] what determined that truly you are a son
[1:22:20] of god but here for by one spirit are we
[1:22:24] all baptized into one body where they
[1:22:27] will be what
[1:22:30] melchizedek
[1:22:33] amen here
[1:22:34] ever here
[1:22:36] that's under melchizedek everybody here
[1:22:38] if leviticus you got to be a jew a one
[1:22:41] body whether we be jews or gender
[1:22:44] whether we be water
[1:22:46] or water
[1:22:48] paul is saying jews and gentile and he
[1:22:51] used bond
[1:22:54] and free
[1:22:56] go to galatians 4.
[1:23:01] go to galatians 4 22.
[1:23:08] oh my god

[1:23:23] bond and free everybody here
[1:23:25] if you dare you can say amen
[1:23:29] so it is written
[1:23:30] that abraham had how many sons
[1:23:33] two sons they won by her
[1:23:37] bond made they added by water
[1:23:41] watch here
[1:23:42] bond and what
[1:23:44] now you understand what paul is saying
[1:23:46] in other words the bond were the jews
[1:23:50] and the free were the gentiles
[1:23:53] the jews or the gentiles or those that
[1:23:56] were bond in bondage and those that were
[1:23:59] free listen closely
[1:24:02] verse 23
[1:24:03] but he who was of the bound woman was
[1:24:07] born after the
[1:24:09] those are the jews but he of the free
[1:24:12] woman was by water
[1:24:14] no sex everybody here
[1:24:16] verse 24
[1:24:18] which thing
[1:24:19] where an allegory it was just only a tap
[1:24:23] was an allegory for these are the two
[1:24:26] covenant
[1:24:27] the one from de monsana the jews the law
[1:24:31] which gender the bondage the lord put
[1:24:33] you in prison in bondage
[1:24:35] which is ego
[1:24:38] verse 25 for this edgar is most sana in
[1:24:42] arabia an answer to jerusalem natural
[1:24:46] which is now which now is and is in what
[1:24:50] bondage with her water
[1:24:52] the jews are in bondage today
[1:24:59] but we are not in bondage
[1:25:01] anybody here
[1:25:03] verse 26 but jerusalem which is what
[1:25:07] which is above is what
[1:25:10] this is not a new job it's a heavenly
[1:25:13] jerusalem the church of the firstborn
[1:25:16] the heavenly jerusalem the general
[1:25:19] assembly because the gathering must be
[1:25:22] in shallow
[1:25:26] he said jerusalem which is above is free
[1:25:29] which is the mother
[1:25:31] it's a city of us oh
[1:25:36] about here
[1:25:37] the bible says here that by one spirit
[1:25:40] we are all baptized into one body the
[1:25:43] body of christ the church of the first
[1:25:45] born whether we be jew or gentile
[1:25:48] whether we be burned the jews or free
[1:25:52] the gender and have been all made to
[1:25:54] drink into water
[1:25:56] one spirit not two different holy ghosts
[1:25:59] ever here
[1:26:00] and grieve not the holy spirit whereby
[1:26:04] your water
[1:26:05] until the day of water so this spirit
[1:26:08] not only do you drink of it but it
[1:26:10] serves you
[1:26:12] it tells you that your work with god is
[1:26:14] finished
[1:26:15] everybody cares so far
[1:26:17] so brother branham saying the message
[1:26:19] test he said now notice jerusalem
[1:26:22] the word jerusalem is from above
[1:26:26] right back here the bible said which is
[1:26:29] the mother of us all
[1:26:31] and christ is our what
[1:26:46] who carried the pregnancy of evil
[1:26:49] who birthed the church
[1:26:53] back here because to pull if they have
[1:26:55] to cut adam and pull him out and to pull
[1:26:59] the bread they have to put jesus to
[1:27:01] sleep at the cross and cut jesus and
[1:27:04] open up because jesus is your mother
[1:27:08] he's the one that gives birth to you
[1:27:11] that's why paul say i'm traveling in
[1:27:14] pain remember on sunday ever here he
[1:27:16] said christ is our mother jesus is
[1:27:19] everything to you he is your redeemer he
[1:27:22] is your god he is your king he is your
[1:27:25] mother he is your protector he is your
[1:27:28] lamb he's your sacrifice he's your
[1:27:30] temper he's everything
[1:27:33] [Applause]
[1:27:35] ever here
[1:27:36] christ is our mother we realize that god
[1:27:40] is our water
[1:27:41] for we are born of him
[1:27:44] and if the sun therefore shall make you
[1:27:47] free you shall be water
[1:27:50] that's why you are free because the sun
[1:27:52] have met you and has free you that's why
[1:27:55] you are not under bondage anymore but
[1:27:58] you are of the free woman
[1:28:00] ever cares of her
[1:28:02] blessed be the name of the lord brother
[1:28:04] branham said he could not be held with
[1:28:07] ishmael the seed of bronze woman because
[1:28:11] of the doubting sarah doubted god's word
[1:28:15] that god was able to keep it
[1:28:17] notice abraham you see what i'm building
[1:28:19] on for sunday morning abraham did not
[1:28:22] water
[1:28:24] abraham married to sarah who doubted the
[1:28:27] promise
[1:28:29] so the child came from which birth
[1:28:34] isaac came from who from a man faith
[1:28:37] not a woman's faith
[1:28:39] back here because sarah doubted the
[1:28:42] promise now the man is giving birth
[1:28:45] amen
[1:28:46] amen
[1:28:48] by faith
[1:28:49] and back here sarah did daddy she was
[1:28:53] the one he was not adam that doubted he
[1:28:56] was if that doubted
[1:28:58] the second adam is christ
[1:29:00] here it is a birth by the spoken word
[1:29:04] about here
[1:29:06] so then we shall find more about those
[1:29:08] as we pick it up sunday morning neither
[1:29:11] can the spiritual the natural behavior
[1:29:14] with the spiritual no more can ishmael
[1:29:17] children be here with the children of
[1:29:19] isaac
[1:29:22] with the as a children and no more that
[1:29:25] then the colonel can bear with the
[1:29:27] spiritual
[1:29:28] brother branham continue he said church
[1:29:31] natural
[1:29:32] church spiritual there is a church
[1:29:35] natural that these women here type and
[1:29:38] there is a church spiritual also so the
[1:29:41] natural church and the spiritual church
[1:29:43] cannot be aired together they are two
[1:29:46] different separate times two different
[1:29:50] separate people under two different
[1:29:52] separate water
[1:29:54] that is why the rapture is different
[1:29:58] [Music]
[1:29:59] and will only be for the water
[1:30:04] it cannot come by the natural
[1:30:07] corner seed of the church is i have to
[1:30:10] be the royal seed of the word of god
[1:30:13] through who
[1:30:14] the royal seed that is why the rapture
[1:30:17] has to be water and then the foolish
[1:30:20] virgin will come later
[1:30:23] amen right here because the first one
[1:30:26] that goes out is the bread of jesus
[1:30:28] christ the other one will come after
[1:30:31] we already finished after a thousand
[1:30:33] years and the rest of the dead leave not
[1:30:35] for a thousand water
[1:30:37] because they don't go in the honeymoon
[1:30:39] only the bride goes in the millennium
[1:30:41] everybody here so far i hope you're
[1:30:43] soaking this therefore they will not be
[1:30:46] held together they shall not be in the
[1:30:49] rapture together there is absolutely a
[1:30:51] church natural and a church spiritual a
[1:30:54] church colonel and a church spiritual
[1:30:57] there is no judgment to the royal
[1:31:00] spiritual predestinated seed of abraham
[1:31:05] for they are predestinated to water
[1:31:08] they have accepted god provided
[1:31:10] sacrifice and that sacrifice which was
[1:31:14] hoped
[1:31:14] the water so when you receive the
[1:31:17] message of the hour you are justified
[1:31:20] never to be judged anymore straight to
[1:31:23] god to the heaven and you are a
[1:31:25] candidate for the rapture
[1:31:31] hallelujah
[1:31:32] hallelujah
[1:31:33] the bible said in john 21 but when the
[1:31:37] morning was now come jesus stood on the
[1:31:40] show after the resurrection
[1:31:42] but the disciple knew not that he was
[1:31:44] jesus
[1:31:45] then jesus said unto them disciples
[1:31:50] why is he calling the disciple children
[1:31:54] how many disciples jesus have
[1:31:57] one of them was judah judah was whom
[1:32:01] a devil and jesus said to all that the
[1:32:04] father gave me
[1:32:06] i have lost none of them
[1:32:08] except
[1:32:09] one
[1:32:10] his name is judah the son of perdition
[1:32:13] so when judah went and killed himself
[1:32:16] when jesus came back to the disciple he
[1:32:18] began to call them children
[1:32:22] he didn't call them children when judah
[1:32:24] was there because judah was not his
[1:32:27] child
[1:32:28] he did it after the resurrection
[1:32:31] after he paid the price he went to hell
[1:32:34] he came back up went to heaven the
[1:32:37] sacrifice accepted he came down the
[1:32:40] remaining are correct he said now
[1:32:42] children
[1:32:45] they didn't become children they were
[1:32:48] already children but he unfolded that
[1:32:51] revelation after his sacrifice was
[1:32:54] accepted in heaven judah is no more
[1:32:56] there now i don't call you disciple
[1:32:59] children
[1:33:03] children have ye any meat and they
[1:33:05] answer him no in romans 8 verse 17 the
[1:33:09] bible say if children then we are water
[1:33:13] heirs of who
[1:33:15] enjoyed hair with who
[1:33:19] brother
[1:33:20] the bride you and your husband joint
[1:33:22] amen are you filing your taxes joint
[1:33:25] joint joint
[1:33:27] but here john tell with christ
[1:33:30] if so be that we suffer with him that we
[1:33:33] may also be water
[1:33:36] for whom he did
[1:33:39] he also did water
[1:33:42] to be water
[1:33:44] to the image of whom
[1:33:46] that he might be the water
[1:33:48] among many water
[1:33:51] any question
[1:33:54] the firstborn among many brethren
[1:33:57] hallelujah
[1:34:00] therefore peter said
[1:34:02] you also as lively stone i'll build up a
[1:34:05] spiritual house a holy
[1:34:08] prison
[1:34:10] to offer up spiritual sacrifice
[1:34:12] acceptable to god by jesus christ
[1:34:15] but you're a chosen water
[1:34:17] a royal water
[1:34:19] a holy water a peculiar water that you
[1:34:22] should show forth the presence of him
[1:34:25] that has called you out of darkness
[1:34:28] into his marvelous light
[1:34:30] everybody here which in tampa were not a
[1:34:34] people the gentile but are now the
[1:34:37] people of god and the melchizedek which
[1:34:40] have now or not obtained mercy at the
[1:34:42] beginning but now we have obtained water
[1:34:45] under the mercury priesthood dearly
[1:34:48] beloved i beseech you as strangers like
[1:34:51] abraham and pilgrim like abraham abstain
[1:34:55] from water
[1:34:56] which war against the water
[1:34:58] because your soul has been redeemed the
[1:35:01] black dog is in your flesh now be
[1:35:03] careful of the black dog because your
[1:35:05] soul is with him that's what paul is
[1:35:07] saying
[1:35:09] now paul uh brother branham say have
[1:35:12] made us priests did you ever know what a
[1:35:14] priest is
[1:35:16] what his office is a priest is to make
[1:35:19] sacrifice to make intersection and over
[1:35:22] in hebrew it says that we the church is
[1:35:26] a royal priesthood a royal priesthood a
[1:35:29] holy nation a peculiar people a holy
[1:35:32] nation peculiar people royal priesthood
[1:35:35] offering here it is now offering
[1:35:38] spiritual sacrifice every man and woman
[1:35:42] that comes to god enter into the water
[1:35:45] we all become priests
[1:35:48] let me look at the time
[1:35:50] amen we good ever here
[1:35:52] in hebrew 5 verse 1
[1:35:55] the bible say for every high priest
[1:35:59] taken among men
[1:36:00] is ordained for man
[1:36:02] in things pertaining to god
[1:36:04] evacuate
[1:36:05] that he may offer both gifts and
[1:36:08] sacrifice for sin
[1:36:11] when they pull a high priest like aaron
[1:36:14] god is giving him the office of a
[1:36:15] priesthood and the reason why god is
[1:36:18] giving him the office of the priesthood
[1:36:20] is so that he can do the service to the
[1:36:22] other children of god remember here
[1:36:25] that's what paul is saying in plain
[1:36:27] language
[1:36:28] where are we going
[1:36:30] who can have compassion
[1:36:33] we okay now put a seat belt
[1:36:36] a high priest
[1:36:38] one of his characteristics
[1:36:42] he must have what
[1:36:46] amen we okay now
[1:36:48] levitical priesthood
[1:36:50] mercy said that priesthood
[1:36:52] under the levitical priesthood
[1:36:54] for you to be a high priest
[1:36:57] you must be a man
[1:36:59] that must have
[1:37:04] compassion oh my god
[1:37:08] everybody okay
[1:37:12] levitical priesthood
[1:37:15] everybody here and melchizedek prison
[1:37:20] because the law was a shadow
[1:37:23] it was a tap so when you see the law you
[1:37:25] can tell what is coming up when we see a
[1:37:28] high priest it's telling you there is a
[1:37:30] true high priest somewhere because what
[1:37:32] moses was doing was a copy
[1:37:34] so if the high priest were the human
[1:37:36] temple and and the bonnet jesus christ
[1:37:40] must wear the same thing
[1:37:42] but when you look at jesus christ you
[1:37:44] don't see it
[1:37:45] naturally the high priest have to
[1:37:47] display them naturally jesus have them
[1:37:50] spiritually amen
[1:37:51] here
[1:37:53] hallelujah
[1:37:54] i'm preparing you for the oncoming
[1:37:56] sermon down the road
[1:37:58] here
[1:37:59] so levitical priesthood if a man is a
[1:38:02] high priest
[1:38:05] this man
[1:38:06] must have compassion
[1:38:11] so if you are born under liver
[1:38:14] you are born on the aeron
[1:38:17] and you are harsh
[1:38:21] they cannot put you to the high priest
[1:38:24] because when you get there you're going
[1:38:26] to get the machine gun and shoot the
[1:38:28] entire church
[1:38:32] everybody here because the people that
[1:38:35] approaches david are in distress
[1:38:39] we okay now
[1:38:40] are we blending things together the
[1:38:42] people that come to david
[1:38:46] have debt
[1:38:47] so if they put you there and all you
[1:38:50] want in the office is everybody to have
[1:38:53] 800 point in their credit score
[1:38:57] nobody can come to the office
[1:38:59] because it's fear it's judgment all the
[1:39:01] time when we come he's looking at you by
[1:39:05] the credit score
[1:39:06] when he sees you what is your credit
[1:39:09] 500 bad boy out what is your credit 600
[1:39:14] bad boy out what is your credit 800 good
[1:39:17] boy you have been doing the good stuff
[1:39:19] sit down here that's not the high priest
[1:39:22] hey barker because brother said
[1:39:26] might have 500 in his credit score
[1:39:30] but how did he get 500
[1:39:33] did he really wasted or did the
[1:39:35] circumstances of life happen to him and
[1:39:38] he lost his job
[1:39:41] or maybe he got sick in the hospital
[1:39:44] and because of sickness he lost his job
[1:39:47] and he could not afford to pay his car
[1:39:49] and that's why he has a bad credit or
[1:39:52] maybe he lost his wife and he went
[1:39:54] through a depression
[1:39:56] and because of depression he lost
[1:39:58] everything but if you calibrate him by
[1:40:01] this call you're going to put him out
[1:40:03] not understanding that he was an honest
[1:40:06] man
[1:40:08] anybody okay
[1:40:09] are we okay now
[1:40:11] a high priest
[1:40:12] who have compassion under who
[1:40:18] i thought compassion is from said the
[1:40:20] people that really know
[1:40:23] to qualify for it now for high priest
[1:40:26] you must have compassion on an ignorant
[1:40:30] somebody who doesn't know
[1:40:34] somebody who didn't know better
[1:40:36] anybody here somebody who grew up in a
[1:40:40] ghetto
[1:40:42] somebody who grew up in the street
[1:40:45] he grew up with a mother that was
[1:40:48] changing boyfriend
[1:40:50] like clothing
[1:40:52] that's all he saw
[1:40:54] he never been in church
[1:40:55] [Music]
[1:40:57] every day they're cussing in the house
[1:40:59] from the morning to the evening
[1:41:01] everybody's cussing
[1:41:07] and when you see him he's displaying
[1:41:09] where he grew up
[1:41:11] his language is bad
[1:41:13] he cannot speak without cussing
[1:41:18] a high priest
[1:41:19] must be able
[1:41:21] to reach to that person
[1:41:23] and to to test that person
[1:41:26] and to pull him out
[1:41:31] do you understand
[1:41:32] do you understand because according to
[1:41:35] the law if a priest have a uh
[1:41:39] what do you call it like a club foot or
[1:41:41] he have an infirmity he's disqualified
[1:41:45] he cannot be a priest
[1:41:46] they gotta check you up
[1:41:48] perfect credit score
[1:41:50] curriculum vitae never violated never
[1:41:53] have a ticket
[1:41:54] never have a problem with a police
[1:41:56] officer qualify that's the law
[1:42:01] anybody here
[1:42:02] and those people when jesus christ came
[1:42:05] and look at those perfect people he said
[1:42:08] you race of vipers
[1:42:11] that's john the baptist
[1:42:13] how can you say race of vapors to the
[1:42:15] people that are perfect in the law
[1:42:18] paul from the tribe of benjamin from
[1:42:20] this this this pharisee of the pharisee
[1:42:23] everything perfect and then look they
[1:42:26] say paul say i was a cheap sinner
[1:42:30] everybody here when jesus came he looked
[1:42:33] at them he said you who devoured the
[1:42:36] widow
[1:42:39] i thought he was the publican that
[1:42:42] devoured the widow
[1:42:45] are we okay
[1:42:47] [Laughter]
[1:42:49] where is my clicker hallelujah a high
[1:42:52] priest who can have compassion on the
[1:42:55] ignorant
[1:42:56] and on them that are out of the way

[1:43:04] not to seek the healthy people
[1:43:07] amen you remember reading
[1:43:09] i came to seek the sick one
[1:43:12] because i am a doctor
[1:43:14] i am a physician
[1:43:16] for me to display my talent somebody
[1:43:19] must be sick
[1:43:21] if somebody is sick then i can treat him
[1:43:24] and then my reputation can go that there
[1:43:27] is a good doctor somewhere else the
[1:43:29] reputation of a doctor goes by the cases
[1:43:36] a doctor you bring a sick man he brings
[1:43:40] you a healthy man you bring a sick man
[1:43:42] he bring you a healthy man they say
[1:43:44] that's a good doctor that's what makes

[1:44:37] must be human
[1:44:40] amen
[1:44:42] we cannot have a high priest
[1:44:45] in the old testament that is an angel
[1:44:49] amen because an angel
[1:44:52] they don't feel what we feel
[1:44:54] but here they can appear and disappear i
[1:44:57] cannot disappear until the rapture comes

[1:45:03] must be
[1:45:04] 100 percent human amen
[1:45:08] amen anybody here
[1:45:10] so that when a human being approach him
[1:45:13] he can understand you from which
[1:45:16] standpoint you're coming from

[1:45:23] the high priest understands you
[1:45:26] when you say to the angel i am sick the
[1:45:28] angel doesn't know what you're talking

[1:45:46] the water
[1:45:48] so when the high priest was going into
[1:45:51] the temple
[1:45:52] for the atonement of the entire nation
[1:45:55] because the high priest was taking the
[1:45:58] sin of everybody
[1:45:59] everybody
[1:46:01] give me my time
[1:46:02] what the high priest was doing
[1:46:04] he come here and collect
[1:46:06] what did you do wrong five
[1:46:09] you 20
[1:46:10] you
[1:46:11] 15 you he correctly collected he have a
[1:46:14] big bag like this
[1:46:16] and when he carried that
[1:46:18] it's the sin of the people everybody
[1:46:20] so when he's approaching god
[1:46:23] he doesn't approach god like he is good
[1:46:28] they are the bad one
[1:46:31] amen
[1:46:32] i'm taking time
[1:46:34] here
[1:46:35] he's approaching god
[1:46:37] like
[1:46:38] me
[1:46:39] and them we messed up
[1:46:43] as much as i am pleading for them
[1:46:46] before even i plead for them i must
[1:46:49] plead for myself
[1:46:51] because i have done the same thing that
[1:46:53] they are doing
[1:46:56] amen so number one the high priest have
[1:46:59] to offer the lamb for himself
[1:47:03] here
[1:47:04] he's seeking mercy for himself
[1:47:06] then he goes and pick up the
[1:47:09] congregation and bring mercy and kill
[1:47:12] the second lamb for the congregation
[1:47:16] amen
[1:47:17] and
[1:47:18] levitical pursuit
[1:47:20] the law
[1:47:21] was a shadow of things to come
[1:47:24] what happened under melchizedek
[1:47:27] are we okay amen
[1:47:29] the bible say verse 7 for such a high
[1:47:33] priest
[1:47:34] becomes us in other words is feeding for
[1:47:37] us everybody
[1:47:39] who is water
[1:47:42] and water
[1:47:43] and water
[1:47:45] separated from water
[1:47:47] and the melchizedek our high priest is
[1:47:50] holy
[1:47:55] our high priest is separated from sinner
[1:47:59] he cannot sin
[1:48:01] who can convince me of sin
[1:48:06] there is no way our high priest can sin
[1:48:09] when he comes he was god in human flesh
[1:48:13] god cannot sin
[1:48:15] [Music]
[1:48:17] but paul is saying we need a priest that
[1:48:21] is god it's a good one
[1:48:27] he said our priest is harmless
[1:48:30] he's undefiled he's pure
[1:48:33] he's separated from sinner and made
[1:48:36] higher than heaven who need not daily as
[1:48:40] those high priests to offer up sacrifice
[1:48:43] first for his own sin and then for the
[1:48:45] people for this he did was when he
[1:48:48] offered up water
[1:48:51] in the old testament under the levitical
[1:48:54] priesthood the high priest himself
[1:48:56] offered sin for himself then for the
[1:48:58] people but under melchizedek the one who
[1:49:01] came doesn't have sin
[1:49:06] amen what did god do anybody care
[1:49:10] number one god
[1:49:13] became human
[1:49:14] amen
[1:49:15] everybody
[1:49:17] in the man called jesus christ
[1:49:20] ever here
[1:49:21] and jesus was the name of god
[1:49:24] america
[1:49:26] but the problem with jesus
[1:49:28] jesus was 100 percent human
[1:49:32] and 100 percent god
[1:49:38] do you follow me
[1:49:39] i hope we on the algebra right
[1:49:42] he must be good because only god can pay
[1:49:47] the penalty of god
[1:49:51] ever here
[1:49:52] he must be human because he must
[1:49:55] understand
[1:49:56] us
[1:49:57] the way we are
[1:49:59] ever here
[1:50:00] ever here

[1:50:08] sides ever here before he resurrected
[1:50:13] lazarus he first cried just like you

[1:54:22] how much headache would have they saved
[1:54:24] themself
[1:54:28] how much headache
[1:54:30] that's the kind of high priest
[1:54:33] we need
[1:54:35] [Music]
[1:54:36] are we okay
[1:54:38] my god
[1:54:40] somebody's pulling very hard
[1:54:42] amen
[1:54:43] for their love make men high priests
[1:54:47] which have
[1:54:48] water they have weaknesses
[1:54:52] but the word of us
[1:54:54] which was since the law because he
[1:54:56] already existed
[1:54:58] maketh the son who is consecrated for
[1:55:00] water
[1:55:02] it's a different kind of high priest
[1:55:04] amen for he
[1:55:06] has made him to be water
[1:55:13] you okay
[1:55:15] jesus when he was going he was 100
[1:55:20] men
[1:55:21] and 100 percent god
[1:55:23] meaning
[1:55:24] if
[1:55:25] they tempt you
[1:55:27] they were also tempting jesus
[1:55:29] you follow me
[1:55:31] when they tempt you
[1:55:33] you look and you fell for temptation
[1:55:35] you become guilty
[1:55:37] you follow me
[1:55:39] but jesus was not falling for temptation
[1:55:43] amen are you following me
[1:55:45] so jesus was guiltyless
[1:55:47] [Music]
[1:55:50] so when you approach jesus he can feel
[1:55:53] your temptation
[1:55:55] but he cannot become what you are
[1:55:58] amen do you follow me because he's still
[1:56:01] pure
[1:56:02] but here
[1:56:03] when you come you are guilty you don't
[1:56:06] want to look at his eyes
[1:56:08] back here because you
[1:56:10] were tempted and you fail
[1:56:12] and you consume the temptation and
[1:56:15] you're coming to him even when he's
[1:56:17] tempted he doesn't consume the
[1:56:19] temptation so he's still a little bit
[1:56:22] different than you ever care the
[1:56:24] guiltiness
[1:56:26] do you follow me the shame
[1:56:29] that you feel
[1:56:31] christ could not really feel it
[1:56:34] he can feel your temptation i'm going
[1:56:36] slowly i know i'm pushing different
[1:56:38] gears but it's going to help you okay
[1:56:41] but to be guilty like he did something
[1:56:43] bad jesus have not done because there
[1:56:46] was no sin in him
[1:56:48] amen
[1:56:49] amen
[1:56:50] let me read that again for he has made
[1:56:54] him water he was not seen they made him
[1:56:58] sin for us who knew what
[1:57:02] that we might be made the water
[1:57:06] in other words god look at jesus
[1:57:08] and say the way you are still like this
[1:57:12] you won't understand my children very
[1:57:14] good
[1:57:15] i have to do something
[1:57:17] do you follow me
[1:57:19] do you follow me because when they
[1:57:21] approach you the guilty
[1:57:23] you can sympathize but you don't feel
[1:57:26] their guiltiness
[1:57:28] everybody care amen so god
[1:57:31] god in jesus christ
[1:57:32] pull off
[1:57:34] do you follow me in gethsemane god came
[1:57:37] off
[1:57:38] i'm going slowly so the elementary you
[1:57:41] can get it god came out of jesus
[1:57:44] ever here
[1:57:45] he came out and he left jesus alone
[1:57:49] my father my father
[1:57:51] why have thou what what
[1:57:54] and then he took your sin
[1:57:56] you follow me
[1:57:58] he took your sin
[1:58:00] and he put it on jesus christ
[1:58:05] do you follow me
[1:58:06] now the feeling that jesus has
[1:58:10] is like he did it
[1:58:12] but he didn't do it you the one that did
[1:58:15] it
[1:58:16] he bore your guilt
[1:58:19] he bore your shame
[1:58:21] ever here
[1:58:30] he will help you love jesus more
[1:58:34] he will help you love jesus more
[1:58:36] are you in this audience this afternoon
[1:58:39] sinners
[1:58:40] god hates him
[1:58:42] but he loves them
[1:58:44] he loves you so much that he gave his
[1:58:47] only begotten son that he might drink
[1:58:50] the bitter cup for you
[1:58:52] remember he became water
[1:58:55] that human became water in other words
[1:58:58] god exchanged you and him
[1:59:00] he said you feel temptation but you
[1:59:03] don't feel the guilt
[1:59:04] let me make you feel the guilt of my
[1:59:07] children
[1:59:07] [Music]
[1:59:09] so when they're coming guilty after they
[1:59:11] have done something wrong you can also
[1:59:14] understand them in that standpoint
[1:59:17] amen hallelujah
[1:59:20] remember he became you that you might
[1:59:23] become him he became a sinner as
[1:59:26] separated from the water
[1:59:28] when he screamed my god why is that
[1:59:31] water
[1:59:32] he was separated from god
[1:59:35] in his death that you in your death
[1:59:38] might have god's water
[1:59:41] he became a child of water
[1:59:45] your sins
[1:59:47] not his own yours that you might become
[1:59:50] a child of water
[1:59:52] he took your place as a time creature
[1:59:56] that you might take his place as an
[1:59:58] eternal water
[1:59:59] and water
[2:00:02] amen
[2:00:05] hallelujah
[2:00:06] but with the precious blood of christ
[2:00:10] as they lab without water
[2:00:13] and without water
[2:00:15] who verily was for of them
[2:00:18] before the foundation of the world but
[2:00:21] was manifested in this last time for
[2:00:23] whom
[2:00:26] god say i'm gonna make you a good high
[2:00:28] priest
[2:00:29] you don't feel any temptation you must
[2:00:32] feel everything that they felt
[2:00:35] anybody here
[2:00:36] when they just coming from prostitution
[2:00:38] their guiltiness the feeling
[2:00:40] take that one put it on christ
[2:00:43] ever here so christ was loaded pretty
[2:00:46] good
[2:00:47] with your old sin
[2:00:52] amen uh i hope i'm talking to the seed
[2:00:55] of god
[2:00:57] amen the same jesus god
[2:01:00] is
[2:01:01] you were not even born
[2:01:05] do you follow me
[2:01:07] what you did today
[2:01:09] was already in christ
[2:01:12] [Music]
[2:01:13] all god was looking for is your
[2:01:16] representation
[2:01:18] and he look at everything you are done
[2:01:21] everybody here even what you gonna fail
[2:01:24] tomorrow
[2:01:26] [Music]
[2:01:28] amen
[2:01:30] he put everything
[2:01:32] and summarize
[2:01:34] in other words if you're gonna leave 45
[2:01:37] or 10 or you're going to live 60 or 70
[2:01:41] years god look at 70 years and look at
[2:01:44] every scene you're going to commit in 70
[2:01:47] years and gather everything up and say
[2:01:50] this one is for brother greg
[2:01:53] this one is for brother kelly this one
[2:01:55] is for brother robert this one is for so
[2:01:58] the more jesus is saying you are here
[2:02:01] brother kelly here brother able here
[2:02:04] sister uh uh chair on here sister who is
[2:02:08] so the entire body is just completely
[2:02:13] filthy
[2:02:14] until when the heaven look the sun
[2:02:17] closed the eyes
[2:02:19] and the sun became dark
[2:02:22] too much
[2:02:24] too much
[2:02:25] a human being cannot be that bad
[2:02:33] even the fifth of the cross there
[2:02:35] whatever he did was there
[2:02:38] amen
[2:02:40] amen
[2:02:41] whatever abraham did what david did what
[2:02:45] jacob did all of them god gather up and
[2:02:48] put it in him
[2:02:52] because a high priest
[2:02:54] must understand
[2:02:56] the ignorant
[2:02:57] and those that are out of the way
[2:02:59] anybody here so when you are sinner
[2:03:03] jesus is just laughing
[2:03:05] because he already understood you
[2:03:07] when you are coming you're crying head
[2:03:09] over he doesn't surprise him
[2:03:11] he already understands
[2:03:13] it's surprising you because of spiritual
[2:03:15] amnesia
[2:03:17] you forgot that you were a child of god
[2:03:19] you were born in sin but he already knew
[2:03:22] that in 1940 something he's gonna come
[2:03:24] to the altar
[2:03:26] [Applause]
[2:03:28] hallelujah that's why he doesn't blame
[2:03:30] you
[2:03:33] let me continue you will get that lady
[2:03:36] everybody here so far
[2:03:37] what is compassion
[2:03:43] i'm over two minutes
[2:03:46] brother branham said he went into the
[2:03:49] temple
[2:03:50] we call him a mick man
[2:03:53] he was but many times we misunderstand
[2:03:56] what meekness is
[2:04:00] are we okay
[2:04:03] he was a man of compassion
[2:04:07] but yet we felt some time to understand
[2:04:11] what compassion is
[2:04:16] not human sympathy
[2:04:19] is not compassion
[2:04:21] but compassion is water
[2:04:27] relax
[2:04:29] relax
[2:04:31] you're gonna see who you are
[2:04:34] compassion
[2:04:35] is doing the will of god
[2:04:40] our compassion
[2:04:41] the way we understand compassion is
[2:04:44] different
[2:04:45] our compassion we want to even save
[2:04:48] judah
[2:04:51] [Music]
[2:04:53] did you get it
[2:04:54] did you get it our compassion for you to
[2:04:57] be really compassionate if you see judah
[2:04:59] take him to heaven
[2:05:03] that's not compassion
[2:05:07] compassion goes always with melchizedek
[2:05:12] here
[2:05:13] and back here
[2:05:15] compassion is doing the will of god
[2:05:19] listen
[2:05:20] what he's saying verily verily i say
[2:05:23] unto you the son can do whatever
[2:05:27] in himself but what he sees the water
[2:05:31] the father do
[2:05:33] there is the compassion
[2:05:36] come on
[2:05:37] knowing the water
[2:05:39] and what
[2:05:44] so compassion is not just doing the will
[2:05:46] of god compassion is first
[2:05:49] knowing the will of god
[2:05:52] and then doing it
[2:05:54] that's compassion
[2:05:58] hallelujah see the sun can do nothing in
[2:06:02] himself but what he sees not his
[2:06:05] what he sees the father doing
[2:06:07] that does the son likewise that's why in
[2:06:11] the pool of bethesda when he entered how
[2:06:14] many people were there multitude
[2:06:18] how many did he heal
[2:06:20] why
[2:06:22] if i ask you you're going to say that's
[2:06:24] bad
[2:06:25] he has the power why he didn't heal
[2:06:28] everybody
[2:06:29] melchizedek is different he's chasing
[2:06:32] the predestinated scene
[2:06:35] do you see how you special when he enter
[2:06:38] he has a commission he's entering he say
[2:06:40] where is he
[2:06:44] wake up
[2:06:47] out
[2:06:48] and that's it
[2:06:50] that's compassion
[2:06:52] our compassion is
[2:06:54] cmc presbyterian november everybody out
[2:06:59] and when you're bringing them out they
[2:07:01] go straight to the nightclub
[2:07:03] because you heal the sinner
[2:07:05] [Music]
[2:07:10] the bible say in hebrew 10 i'm going to
[2:07:12] search word to land
[2:07:14] wherefore when he cometh into the world
[2:07:18] jesus christ he said sacrifice and
[2:07:21] offering the word is not
[2:07:24] about here
[2:07:25] i desire mercy rather than water
[2:07:29] sacrifice and offering the word is known
[2:07:32] but a what
[2:07:34] the body of jesus christ that we just
[2:07:36] explained you god loaded with everything
[2:07:38] but a body has not prepared me everybody
[2:07:42] in burnt offering and sacrifice for what
[2:07:46] sin that has no pleasure he's erasing
[2:07:49] the law completely now anybody clear now
[2:07:52] he's going on the mercury
[2:07:55] then as then said uh
[2:07:57] i
[2:07:58] lo akam in the volume of the book it is
[2:08:01] written of me to do what
[2:08:04] that will oh
[2:08:06] compassion
[2:08:08] the body came to do the will of god he
[2:08:12] came for compassion
[2:08:14] and back here
[2:08:16] the body of christ came for compassion
[2:08:18] because of the names that were written
[2:08:21] in the book of life
[2:08:24] everybody here
[2:08:26] mark 14 36 and he said about father
[2:08:31] all things are possible and today
[2:08:33] take away this cup from me
[2:08:36] nevertheless
[2:08:37] not what are
[2:08:39] but what that what
[2:08:41] compassion
[2:08:43] he look he said if i ask him he's going
[2:08:45] to deliver me
[2:08:46] but when he look he say
[2:08:49] sister hadassah
[2:08:51] i cannot i cannot let her go
[2:08:54] i cannot help it go father
[2:08:56] not my will
[2:08:59] people are there
[2:09:01] i cannot let them go
[2:09:04] my will is all the father giving me our
[2:09:06] laws
[2:09:08] ever here
[2:09:11] when we talked about compassion
[2:09:14] we are looking at not human compassion
[2:09:17] but doing the will of god so the high
[2:09:20] priest
[2:09:21] ever care
[2:09:22] must know god will
[2:09:26] and must do it
[2:09:28] anybody here he must know god's will and
[2:09:32] he must execute the will of god back
[2:09:35] here
[2:09:36] that's compassion and number two he must
[2:09:39] also be compassionate to the ignorant
[2:09:43] let me get ignorant so we can stop
[2:09:45] everybody here
[2:09:47] when we talk about ignorance
[2:09:49] let me clarify compassion everybody
[2:09:53] compassion
[2:09:55] is doing the will of god the will of god
[2:09:58] is that every child of god that is
[2:10:02] predestinated
[2:10:04] and that was in the mind of god
[2:10:07] based on their origin before the
[2:10:09] foundation of the word jesus will lose
[2:10:12] none of them amen amen
[2:10:15] america
[2:10:16] so when god comes to you
[2:10:19] amen to save you it's actually him doing
[2:10:23] the will of god
[2:10:28] you will gather later
[2:10:29] when we talked about ignorance let me
[2:10:32] get here and then i'll let you go home
[2:10:35] and the priest shall make an atonement
[2:10:38] for the soul
[2:10:39] that sin is how
[2:10:42] when he sinneth by ignorance before the
[2:10:45] lord to make an atonement for him and he
[2:10:48] shall be forgiven him
[2:10:50] so ignorance didn't start here
[2:10:53] he started in the old testament amen
[2:10:56] anybody care
[2:10:58] you shall have one love for him
[2:11:01] that sinneth through ignorance
[2:11:04] how many love
[2:11:07] you shall have one law for him that
[2:11:10] sinneth through ignorance
[2:11:12] but for him that is born among the
[2:11:15] children of israel and further
[2:11:18] that's a journey among water
[2:11:21] how many law
[2:11:22] one
[2:11:23] for the jews
[2:11:25] and for their
[2:11:29] in the old testament one law
[2:11:31] for ignorance anybody care
[2:11:34] no separation let me get here
[2:11:37] that you
[2:11:38] knew the word of god
[2:11:42] right
[2:11:42] they heard the law
[2:11:44] the gentile did not have the word of god
[2:11:48] how can a jew be ignored
[2:11:54] you see now
[2:11:56] you see what ignorance is
[2:12:00] but in acts 3
[2:12:02] verse 14 but he denied the holy one
[2:12:07] and the chest and desire murderer to be
[2:12:10] granted unto you this is peter probably
[2:12:12] speaking he says they gave you barabbas
[2:12:15] and jesus you guys shouted for barabbas
[2:12:18] and you wanted to kill jesus christ
[2:12:20] he said and killed the prince of life
[2:12:23] whom god has raised from the dead
[2:12:26] whereof we are witnesses
[2:12:28] and now brethren i want that through
[2:12:31] water
[2:12:32] he did it as did also yo
[2:12:36] but those things which god before had
[2:12:38] showed by the mouth of all his prophet
[2:12:41] that christ should suffer he has so done
[2:12:44] what
[2:12:45] repent ye therefore and be converted
[2:12:48] that your sin through ignorance
[2:12:51] may be water
[2:12:53] blotted out when the time of refreshing
[2:12:56] shall come from the presence of who
[2:12:59] is showing that the jews knew the law
[2:13:02] but yet by knowing the law they killed
[2:13:04] the messiah
[2:13:07] and when peter looked he said you did it
[2:13:10] through ignorance
[2:13:12] a high priest must understand
[2:13:15] the ignorant one
[2:13:19] we okay amen i'm going to celebrate here
[2:13:21] probably
[2:13:23] and i thank christ jesus our lord
[2:13:26] who has enabled me
[2:13:28] for that he counted me faithful this is
[2:13:31] paul
[2:13:32] putting me into the ministry in other
[2:13:34] words after every damage that i caused
[2:13:37] to the church of the living god i have
[2:13:39] arrested them i whooped them i took them
[2:13:42] i put them to prison but
[2:13:44] something is blowing my mind
[2:13:47] what is blowing your mind paul what
[2:13:49] blows my mind is that
[2:13:52] after everything had done bad
[2:13:55] to his children
[2:13:57] he still comes
[2:13:58] and take me paul
[2:14:00] a bad man
[2:14:02] and he put me into the ministry
[2:14:05] how can he do that
[2:14:09] he takes the distress
[2:14:11] to go to david
[2:14:13] he take the beater soul to go to david
[2:14:16] he takes the public and the sinner
[2:14:18] those are the ones he's looking for paul
[2:14:21] said the way i am i am disqualified
[2:14:24] because i persecuted the church i have
[2:14:26] blaspheme i did everything that is bad i
[2:14:29] thought when i met him he's going to say
[2:14:32] not you
[2:14:34] ever hear
[2:14:35] but melchizedek doesn't look at that
[2:14:38] he knows that he was not you that did it
[2:14:42] everybody here
[2:14:43] when he looked at paul he said paul
[2:14:45] begin to say i'm sorry you know i
[2:14:48] persecuted the church you know uh when
[2:14:50] they were killing steven there i was
[2:14:52] there i consented paul said god said
[2:14:56] enough
[2:14:58] he said so
[2:14:59] you say enough i don't want you to talk
[2:15:01] anymore
[2:15:03] okay christ so what do you want
[2:15:05] so you're going to send me to hell
[2:15:07] he said i want you
[2:15:09] to preach the gospel
[2:15:11] [Music]
[2:15:13] me
[2:15:16] do you understand what you say
[2:15:18] me paul
[2:15:20] say yes you paul nobody else you
[2:15:25] you got peter
[2:15:26] not peter
[2:15:27] matter of fact when you come you're
[2:15:30] gonna be above all of
[2:15:32] [Music]
[2:15:34] them amen
[2:15:36] but they slept with you they were
[2:15:39] helping you i understand
[2:15:41] you the very very bad one
[2:15:44] you are the one i was looking for
[2:15:47] because paul you were a chosen
[2:15:50] [Music]
[2:15:52] do you know that in act 9 you were a
[2:15:55] chosen
[2:15:56] vessel
[2:15:57] ananias go pray for paul father you know
[2:16:02] that man that's a bad man
[2:16:05] he is arrested ananias calm down
[2:16:09] i know what i put in him
[2:16:12] that bad man
[2:16:13] go over there and go pray for him
[2:16:17] that's why before he even get the holy
[2:16:20] ghost ananias came he said brother saul
[2:16:26] the brother have not received the holy
[2:16:28] ghost yet but they gave ananias the
[2:16:31] revelation by melchizedek that before
[2:16:34] the foundation of the word you and him
[2:16:37] were playing over there
[2:16:40] and i said oh so he was my brother yes
[2:16:43] in eternity there you two were
[2:16:45] fellowshipping over there and then i
[2:16:47] asked him and then asked be careful he
[2:16:49] might have a gun brother
[2:16:58] he takes a high priest
[2:17:01] to make ananias understand that
[2:17:04] he take a high priest to make paul
[2:17:07] understand it and let me stop here we're
[2:17:09] going to pick up
[2:17:10] the bible say who was before a
[2:17:13] blasphemer and a persecutor and an
[2:17:16] injurious
[2:17:18] but i obtained what
[2:17:22] i desire what
[2:17:25] versus what
[2:17:27] but i obtained mercy because i did it
[2:17:33] in water
[2:17:35] i thought paul was trained under the
[2:17:38] feet of gamalia
[2:17:40] he knew the law left and right but still
[2:17:42] under unbelief
[2:17:45] i did it ignorantly and the grace of our
[2:17:49] lord was water
[2:17:51] and water
[2:17:53] with water and water
[2:17:55] which is in who
[2:17:57] this is a faithful water
[2:18:00] and worthy of all acceptation that
[2:18:02] christ jesus came into the world to save
[2:18:05] who
[2:18:06] of water
[2:18:12] if they give you the law
[2:18:14] are you going to choose paul
[2:18:16] [Music]
[2:18:18] are you going to choose paul
[2:18:20] are you going to entrust paul and matter
[2:18:22] of fact the grace that was in jesus
[2:18:24] christ jesus took it and handed to paul
[2:18:28] you remember we saw it and paul took
[2:18:30] that grace and begin to
[2:18:31] go with the jew and that you begin to
[2:18:33] reject the paul and you go to roman nine
[2:18:36] you will see paul grieving for the jew
[2:18:38] that i wish that meepo was cursed and
[2:18:42] the jews entering why paul became christ
[2:18:46] amen he is now accepting to be destroyed
[2:18:50] so that israel entered that's why moses
[2:18:53] said if you want to destroy them come
[2:18:55] and destroy me
[2:18:57] the high priest and the melchizedek
[2:19:00] because moses began to understand things
[2:19:03] differently and the people that wanted
[2:19:05] to stone moses moses say you want to
[2:19:08] kill them kill me and moses even tell
[2:19:10] god go in the book of life take my name
[2:19:13] off
[2:19:14] and god scratch his head
[2:19:16] he said moses you're right
[2:19:18] but when i'm saying no he was not moses
[2:19:20] he was melchizedek in moses let's stand
[2:19:23] up
[2:19:24] [Music]
[2:19:30] so today
[2:19:32] you understand the priesthood
[2:19:36] the people that follow david the people
[2:19:38] in trouble
[2:19:40] it's an anointing that comes
[2:19:45] to bring compassion
[2:19:47] to the ignorant
[2:19:48] and to those that are out of the way
[2:19:51] that's why jesus said i didn't come for
[2:19:54] sacrifice
[2:19:56] if i came for sacrifice i could be in
[2:19:58] the temple
[2:19:59] amen
[2:20:00] waiting for sacrifice i came for mercy
[2:20:04] i came to seek the sinner the republican
[2:20:06] those that are sick
[2:20:08] that's what i came for
[2:20:10] not the levitical priesthood
[2:20:12] that's why the samaritan when he's
[2:20:14] coming what the priest fell
[2:20:17] what the levat fell
[2:20:19] the good samaritan came in
[2:20:22] and fulfilled it who is this good
[2:20:24] samaritan
[2:20:26] who is it
[2:20:29] ah my god let's pray
[2:20:31] heavenly father
[2:20:33] lord we are approaching you again humbly
[2:20:35] tonight
[2:20:37] father once again thanking you
[2:20:40] for your mercy
[2:20:42] for your grace
[2:20:43] and for your love
[2:20:45] that you have lord display into christ
[2:20:48] the lord
[2:20:49] father the more we go deep into these
[2:20:52] things
[2:20:54] the more we can now see further
[2:20:57] the love that you have for us
[2:21:00] that father despite everything that we
[2:21:02] have done
[2:21:04] and sometimes we have acted foolishly
[2:21:07] sometimes we knew better and we did
[2:21:09] things wrong
[2:21:11] but still
[2:21:12] because of predestination
[2:21:15] father you have not let any of us go
[2:21:18] father when we didn't even understand
[2:21:21] the message
[2:21:23] when we didn't have even understood this
[2:21:26] revelation
[2:21:27] when lord father we had questioned
[2:21:30] puzzling our mind
[2:21:31] but there was a supernatural element
[2:21:34] that was still holding on to our lives
[2:21:37] lord
[2:21:38] father pulling us and we know that
[2:21:41] somebody is watching over us
[2:21:43] and that somebody is no other than the
[2:21:46] savior himself
[2:21:47] the creator
[2:21:49] of heaven and earth who is a husband who
[2:21:52] is a father who is a mother who is
[2:21:55] everything to us
[2:21:57] father as you continue to unfold
[2:21:59] yourself and display yourself in such a
[2:22:02] way lord
[2:22:03] the more we can see you in this light
[2:22:06] the more now we can live for you
[2:22:09] not by constrain
[2:22:11] or by a law or by a commandment but now
[2:22:15] we want to live for you out of love out
[2:22:18] of appreciation because how can we hurt
[2:22:22] somebody that gave so much for us
[2:22:26] how can we do something bad to a man
[2:22:29] that took a shame that took our guilt
[2:22:32] that took our pain that took our
[2:22:34] suffering even before we were born
[2:22:37] before we even sin that man took our sin
[2:22:40] upon him why do we want to disappoint
[2:22:43] such a man by going astray why do we
[2:22:46] want to do things bad further to make
[2:22:49] your heart against suffering because
[2:22:51] when you pull your prophet outside
[2:22:53] father you show him that every time he
[2:22:56] was sinning his sin was striking your
[2:23:00] face and blood was gushing out of you
[2:23:02] and you are still screaming and you say
[2:23:05] father forgive him lord and father many
[2:23:07] times we do things that are right that
[2:23:10] are not right things that are wrong
[2:23:12] things that we have been preached we
[2:23:14] have been taught in this church not to
[2:23:16] do and we still do it lord father and
[2:23:19] lord you are still there father lord
[2:23:22] jesus christ interceding and pleading
[2:23:25] lord father with blood gushing over your
[2:23:27] face and saying father forgive them they
[2:23:31] have not come to the understanding yet
[2:23:33] but lord may everybody turn their eyes
[2:23:36] father in this church and those that are
[2:23:38] streaming to look at that picture and to
[2:23:41] see what we have been doing all the time
[2:23:44] and then from there on we can learn not
[2:23:47] as a law not as feeling going to hell
[2:23:50] but further as a matter of love and
[2:23:53] appreciation to live for you and to do
[2:23:56] everything that we can by the power of
[2:23:58] the holy spirit father to please you
[2:24:00] lord lord we thank you lord father for
[2:24:03] unfolding these things lord we are
[2:24:05] committing your children unto the hand
[2:24:07] and those that are sick those that are
[2:24:09] struggling those that will be lord
[2:24:11] father traveling back lord the father
[2:24:13] may you protect them under the great
[2:24:16] wings of jehovah may you protect your
[2:24:18] children as they going home lord and may
[2:24:20] you continue to unfold your revelation
[2:24:23] more and more until an ankle will be
[2:24:26] grasping their soul and father don't
[2:24:29] never let them go until we meet you into
[2:24:32] the air lord father we humbly ask it and
[2:24:34] commit everything unto the hand in the
[2:24:36] name of jesus christ
[2:24:38] amen
[2:24:40] god bless you church we love you
[2:24:42] [Applause]
[2:24:51] amen amen
[2:24:54] when the seas are raging in the boat
[2:24:56] in the bible and the disciples were
[2:24:58] worried
[2:24:59] and they turned to the master
[2:25:01] and he said peace be still
