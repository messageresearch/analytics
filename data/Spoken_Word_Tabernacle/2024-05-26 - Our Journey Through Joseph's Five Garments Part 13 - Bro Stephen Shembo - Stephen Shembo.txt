good to see you amen welcome and Joseph was brought down that's sister truin she's right there and Joseph was brought down to Egypt and pipar an officer of pharaoh captain of the Guard an Egyptian bought him of the hands of the ishmaelite which had brought him down there you might be seated now you understand all of this and the Lord was with Joseph yesterday we established the three poles in Egypt amen amen amen amen okay and the Lord was with Joseph and he was a prosperous man and he was in the house of his master the Egyptian and his master saw that the Lord was with him notice that he noticed that God was with Joseph there was something about Joseph that someone can look and say there is a Godly presence something is accompanying this boy this boy is different than any other boy you can tell it by looking at his life that's what we want in our life so wherever you are at work in school people can look at you and they say there is something different about you and the Bible say and his master saw that the Lord was with him and that the Lord made all that he did prosper in his hand and Joseph found Grace in his sight watch those word carefully and he served him and he made him overseer over his house and all that he had he put into his hand and he came to pass from the time that he made him overseer he surrender everything in his house and over all that he had that the Lord blessed the Egyptians house for Joseph's sake the egypti received the blessing because of Joseph so the coming of Joseph into the house brought a blessing so if he was struggling somewhere in the field or in his house with his businesses and maybe things were not going well Joseph coming into the house makes things better amen and the blessing of the Lord was upon all that he had in the house and in the field everybody clear let's go to Luke chapter two is is straightforward now amen still like a little Echo yeah just a little bit amen yeah it's getting better hopefully I can hear

humble yourself therefore under the might hand of God that he may exalt you in due time so there is a Time prepare that God will exalt you yes sir but the problem is humble yourself to whatever God is doing now yes sir amen amen amen casting all your care upon who him for he does what he carth for you you all anxiety put it on him amen be soor let me leave that alone be vigilant because your adversary the devil as a roaring lion walks about seeking whom he may what devour so somebody is after someone that's right verse n whom resisted fast in the faith the only way you can resist in the faith because faith is the victory that overcometh the world Amen in the faith knowing that the same Affliction are accomplished in your brethren that are where in the world in other word you're not the only one suffering that's right oh Lord I'm the only one suffering in this church no you probably are the one that speak too much about it but it doesn't mean that when we quiet we don't go through suffering amen amen I can give somebody a NE of the quiet I give I one go it depends on how emotional you are somebody will be like so we sometime we go you are loud but we all go through the same thing we clear now amen praise God he says but the God of all Grace uh the God of all Grace who has called us to his eternal glory so your calling is toward eternal Glory am by Christ Jesus after not before after that you have suffered a while amen make you how perfect so Perfection comes after suffering that's right amen amen amen in other word if you got suffering here amen amen you cannot put Perfection here no sir it won't work Perfection is always here so if you want to see Perfection you need to use the door of suffering amen amen amen amen amen he says Echo again he says and that you have suffered a while make you how perfect perfect and how establish establish he stabilizing you and then strengthen and do what all these things are Beyond suffering in other words suffering will open the door for Perfection for stabilization for I mean to strengthen you and then to settle you without suffering none of this will happen amen are we together let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we are approaching you again humbly father this morning Lord thanking you for your grace for your love your mercy and for everything you have been doing for us father this is as far as I can go with the ability you have given us Lord but when it comes to interpret your word he only take the Holy Spirit a supernatural touch from thee Lord to speak to us and to Lord give us a spiritual ear where we can hear what the spirit is saying unto the churches father may you protect us under the blood may you remember those that are streaming online and speak to our soul this morning and move me completely out of the way Lord in the name of Jesus Christ amen my subject this morning is our life journey through Joseph five garment part 13 amen we already established our garment we know that the first one is a coat of many colors I don't want to call out amen the second one is a servant or a slave the third one is a prisoner making your life easy today it's a Memorial Day the fourth one is to appear before Pharaoh amen and the fifth one is a fine Len the one that goes with marriage of the lamb and adoption amen for those that were yesterday we found out that the C of Many Colors happen in Canaan amen amen and every women in coat here happen in Egypt that's right right and even though we going through four garment in Egypt we found out that Joseph Ministry in Egypt went to three places you remember that yesterday he went from P for house amen into the prison and from the prison he went to Pharaoh we got P right there amen from Piper to prison from prison to Pharaoh amen and we found out that when he was in Piper house God Prosper him and when he went into prison God prospered him until he reached the third step right here where he reach his adoption amen and we found out that import for house they bless him in the house and in the field amen and in the prison he had to go through some prayer line where he had to deal with people individually he dealt with the battor and discerned what happened in the dream and then the battler goes away then the baker come on the next line and then he begin to deal with the next line and that's where we draw our three pools yesterday that he went through the first pool everybody okay the second pool then the third pool but the third pool is where he really accomplish his mission am because under the third pool that's where he store up the food amen are we together amen and the food that he store up the Bible say it was unlimited because it was like the sand that is on the seashore which was speaking about the Seed of Abraham and yesterday we gave you the scripture that the Seed of Abraham was in other word he was Crush himself unlimited it is a food that they cannot even put a number it's a food that you can take take take and never exhausted and I gave you this coat which brother Mike dily asked for and this is the quat for those who are looking for it brother brandham say you remember what that dream that I got the interpretation was the dream say go back and do what up the and store up the food where was The Storehouse this what Tabernacle so when brother Bram was preaching in Jeffersonville at that time that Tabernacle the Tabernacle in Jeffersonville was used to store up the food am not anybody is food but the food of William Marion Bram amen not the food of Brad neille no sir because brother NE was not the messenger he was working with brother Bram but the tape that was store is the tape of William May Bram amen when he's dead there is no more food amen other than that one amen glory to God and brother Bram say where is there anything like it in the in the country around here anywhere that will compare with the message that we have in other words there is nothing on the Earth today no sir that can be compared am with the message of brother amen remember yesterday the seven years of plenty were used to store up the food amen for the oncoming famine amen because the Bible say in the last day there will be famine amen not the Famine of bread and thirst of water but to hear the word of God am so when the ministry of BR Bram is flourishing it is also taking care of those that were living there but the purpose was to store up the food for the oncoming problem amen because the message churches are starving uhhuh that's right even though they are repeating brother Bram this food is not a food to repeat like a parot no sir it is a food to bring food from it amen are we together amen are we together amen are we together you might rob somebody the wrong way but I don't mean to my friend brother say now of course our Le brother here Brothers here that are out along here these leader other these other leader churches are what Us in other words there were sister churches there he says we are one where would you go to to find it where else can you go to find this kind of message amen amen and brother Bram say show it comparison anywhere there is nothing that you can compare with the message you go right out in the denomination or creats you go right out away from the name of the Lord Jesus you go right out away from these other thing in other word you leave this message uhhuh you going back to the all carryon amen of denomination there is nothing out there that you can compare with this message amen this message is Christ amen are we together Amen brother Bram says see here is where the food has been what stored up just like Joseph was storing the food and brother brandham continue he said well one message that I preach here to you oh look I have been preaching from what one to six hours to you on a what a message one message preach whether it's 1 Hour 2 Hour 3 hours four five or six well if I had to use one of those message brother Bram himself is saying that if I preach a message here and I'm storing the food yes sir amen I'm I store the food for two hours but when I come back Amen to use the same message that I preach to you two hours what will come out of that message amen are we together Amen brother Bram say and if I had to use one of those message I take what a week to take it just a little bit where here and a little bit where there because it has been what stored up here in other words the food is concentrated amen he himself when he's preaching under the anointing he can preach it for one hour but whoever will come back including himself to use that one hour you cannot come up with one hour that's right brother let me put it up home my friend in other word a tape cannot produce another tape a tape will produce multiple Amen in other word when you repeating the message of brother every day they are preaching this message something new need to come out amen amen are we together amen because what has been put there is not one sermon no sir it is a combo it is many sermon store up by a professional amen so whenever the F four Ministry come we are not parot we need to get there and pull 45 sermon from one amen because the food of Joseph is unlimited amen the food of Joseph don't have numbers Hallelujah and that's the food that will help you up in the time of famine meaning you will never go hungry amen if you reach a correct message church amen a correct Message Church will always have something am to feed you every wday every Sunday every Monday there will still something coming up [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah how can we preach a tape and then nothing come out of a tape which message are you preaching Amen brother Bram say if he goes to his message he will take a week amen you taking that message and you take it for 30 minutes so 45 minutes and you stop and I already finished that sermon what did you give to the people superficial understanding superficial understanding there is more to this [Music] corner then what we read so when we read brother Bram one paragraph can give 10 sermon it is Unlimited in other word this is the message that can take care of the famine without this opening of the seals there is no way you can feed the church amen hallelujah people will come to church and go home hungry in other word when they eat they eat they go back they say well he just spent 45 minutes there but I I still need something more than that this message when he comes he will L you until you overflow right hallelujah hallelujah brother Bram say because it has been what stored up here it is where on tapes it shall go where worldwide on the tapes where the people in their what houses them tapes will fall right into the hand of what the predestinated of God he can direct the word he will direct everything just exactly to its what course that is the reason he sent me back to do this to do what store up the food he forbid me to go where overseas listen to what he says on the seals he said you can't possibly hit all the things because you could take that just one of what those seals and stay just bring it up through the what the scripture right down see it takes what months and what and months and what and months and you still would not amen so what did we preach when we preach this [Applause] SE what did we preach we preach the first seal one time and the church got everything what did we preach in other word when we go back to listen to the message we are pulling messages from the message amen amen he has been store up to handle the seven years of famine right and he have to be store up until the Jews yes that's right the brother of Joseph come to Egypt together until the 144,000 will be feeding on the same thing through the ministry of Moses and Elijah because the seventh seal to the blood is the seven trumpet to Israel it's in unlimited message in other words you can never put a period am to this message amen every day God will continue to unfold himself through eternity because what we reach is the Capstone amen the highest level of God and when you reach that level it's unlimited amen so don't stop at what you hear in church here as you going in your H in your car God won't speak to you when you listening in the kitchen God will speak to you when you are wor you playing the TS God will speak to you amen when you in your bedroom you pring the T God will afford to you it is [Applause] unlimited are we together amen are we together amen are we sowing together amen amen amen amen so these five garments here remove all anxiety from us because now we know where we heading that's right we know where we coming from and we know where we going that's why Jesus says this in John 16:28 he said I come forth from what the father and I come where into the world again I leave what the world and I go where to the father but let me tell you that the way Jesus came is not the way he left amen say again when he came he came as a human being that could be killed that's right when he left even the body he left was different than the body he came in with he came in as a servant of Jehovah but he left us a God that have the power over Heaven and Earth amen because when he resurrected he said oh power has been given to me amen and God gave him a new name uh-huh and he saw higher than anything higher than every principality amen every Power he went above all of them why because the way you come in is going to be different than the way you come out amen the way you started here will not be the same remember this is a one way in other word as you changing this Mentor you are going from glory to glory to glory to glory amen until one day your body will change amen and you find yourself in the presence of God are we together amen are we together amen that's why Paul say for I reckon that the what the sufferings of of the what this present time are not worthy to be what compared in other words your suffering don't have the gut to be compared with the glory that is coming in whatever Joseph went through here is not to be compared with what's going to happen in Egypt am when you look at what happened in Egypt and the Joseph in Egypt is far greater than what happened in Canaan amen your present suffering my brother my sister is not compar to what is coming up ahead of us Paul say that I reckon that the suffering of this present time are not worthy to be compared with what the glory which shall be revealed where in us so there is a glory in you that's going to be revealed and when that Glory will be revealed you won't even have the time to remember the suffering you went through the suffering will be solid that it will be like nothing amen that's why he will wipe our tears uh-huh and our memories will be completely wiped out because what we see make you forget it's so overwhelming until you don't remember when you were suffering in a hospital amen amen in other word we know where we coming from uh-huh now we know where we heading amen we are not here hophazardly whichever state in your life you are you are not hophazardly you know that something is happening you cannot start a caterpillar without ending with a butterfly that's right if I already engage for a caterpillar I must end up as a butterfly amen God whenever he's after he's Omega amen when he start something he will finish it amen and who began the good work in you uhhuh the Bible say he will complete it amen finish it until the day of Jesus Christ Amen brother Bram says this about this guy here he says he remind me of one time I don't like to say this word but he was just a what ab and he came where to the door and he said could you give me a sandwich I said certainly would you step in and instead of making him a sandwich I thought I fix him something to eat this is Brother BR and fix him up just about what I could around the place and sit him down to eat and while he was eating I thought I would speak to him seeing he was what a traveler a bomb but Traveler amen amen when you look at him he's a traveler a traveler meaning he's coming from somewhere and he's going somewhere but what kind of traveler is this one a pilgrim like Abraham he coming from somewhere he's going somewhere Joseph is coming from Canaan he's heading somewhere amen Jesus say I come from God I'm going from God but let's look at this traveler where is he coming from and where is he going William Maran Bram he says where did you come from he just shrug his shoulder a little and say nowhere we got a problem right there how you are coming from nowhere somehow you were born somewhere that's right amen you had a father and a mother uh-huh somehow you had a home or maybe a wife or something how did you end up here if you are coming from nowhere what do nowhere means hallelujah amen brother brandham say I say then where are you going you coming from nowhere where are you going then William Mar Bram the man he stop eating and look up at me and say nowhere coming from nowhere going nowhere but look like a traveler in other word you are giving the people the impression that you have a vision that you have an ambition that you are somebody that think right we see you packing bags it's giving the outside world an impression that hey that man is coming from somewhere he's traveling somewhere but now when they vibrate you they find out that hey he's a fake man whatever suit that you see on him is fake amen the way he project himself is fake he has he has he has not accomplish anything wow he's coming from nowhere and he doesn't even have a vision where he's going wow brother Bram says he swallow around and swallow a what a big bite that's what he knows how to do and he said sir just where my heart is what resting there is where I do what I rest no objective in life let me ask him how long have he been doing this come on everybody okay brother Bram say I said I see I say third question question how long have you been doing this he said oh some what 20 years or more Jesus let me read it again he did it for somewhat 20 years or more or more with what no Ambitions to do what

like oh what a surprise oh my God let me call hey come the pastor is here this message got everything my friend what if now I got a free pass the door open where are we at my friend verse five and he said peaceably I am come to sacrifice to the Lord sanctify yourself and come with me to the sacrifice come to the meeting and he sanctify Jesse and his son plural Jesse and his sons he Sanctified them plural Jesse and his sons amen and called them to the sacrifice to the meeting and it came to pass when they were come that he look who's looking Prophet the prophet he look on elab and said surely the Lord anointing is before before me before him but the instruction was I am the one to point to you for some reason this boy was so impressive that when they look at him they say wow this must be him this must be him look look how he is this he look like a king the suit sit very well he will make a good president God say sh slow slow slow amen but the Lord said to Sam look not on his what his countenance so the criteria of God is not really on the Outlook what makes God chose David because if he was the Outlook his brother would have taken he says look not on his countenance or on the height of his what sture the choice is not on the continent young man it is not on the height of the statute young man amen the choic is but okay good luck because I have refused him refused him for the Lord sees not as a man what see for for man lookth where on the outward appearance but the Lord look on the what the heart so there was something about the heart of David that God like that's why the purpose of this message is to return the heart sir sir so when God called you to this message God already seen your heart that's why God called you even though you might be too short or Too Tall that was not the choice of God God chose you because of your heart that's why you have a tag to this message and somebody else don't have a tag that's exactly amen and the Bible says then Jesse call
