[18:53] ahead and give you testimony brother I'm
[18:55] sure amen and we do have one
[19:09] amen amen God bless you
[19:12] all um I didn't have the U chance to say
[19:15] thank you yesterday but I just want to
[19:19] thank you all for making the program a
[19:22] wonderful one and we just give glory to
[19:25] the Lord amen just to keep it short that
[19:28] way
[19:29] but I just want to give a testimony
[19:32] um I don't know if you all saw the DJ
[19:35] the one on the sound
[19:37] yesterday um getting to the end of the
[19:40] program or at the end of the program he
[19:43] called both of us my wife and I and he
[19:46] said that when he came for the program
[19:49] he didn't know exactly what it was even
[19:52] though I sent him the songs and all that
[19:55] um but listening to the testimonies know
[19:59] that he realized that the program was
[20:02] for
[20:03] him um so let me give you a little
[20:06] background he's actually one of the
[20:09] pastors of the church that we U rented
[20:12] the the
[20:13] venue so he told me that he's on
[20:18] dialysis and then even that
[20:21] morning he went to do dialysis before
[20:23] coming to the
[20:25] program so um throughout the whole
[20:28] program he was listening and then he was
[20:31] touched that the scripture that our
[20:33] sister had been using is the same
[20:35] scripture he's been using so that had
[20:37] been a confirmation to him so I just
[20:40] want to thank God that we had been
[20:41] praying that this program was going to
[20:43] be a blessing to us leaving one person
[20:46] so we just want to thank the Lord for
[20:54] this I'd like to say something in in a
[20:57] little bit because uh um he's not alone
[21:00] is he I think uh there is not a person
[21:05] here who can't say that we have been
[21:09] influenced and
[21:11] inspired um from what you know portion
[21:14] of the journey we've
[21:15] witnessed and it gives us
[21:18] hope it gives us um
[21:21] Faith um uh right now especially for our
[21:25] sister
[21:26] Kelly and um it's wonderful to sit in a
[21:32] congregation and witness the Miracles of
[21:35] God in our face he's in our
[21:39] face so God bless you all for sh you
[21:42] know for sharing that with us yesterday
[21:45] and for allowing us to be a part of it
[21:47] so I have one of here from Sister
[21:51] Priscilla she said she wants to thank
[21:53] God that her youngest daughter Sarah
[21:56] graduated from high school
[21:59] uh she is off to college in the fall and
[22:01] I pray God to guide her amen so let's
[22:04] remember
[22:06] that um here's a prayer request as well
[22:09] from Sister Priscilla please pray for a
[22:12] two-year-old boy Bruno um
[22:15] Molino um he is in the
[22:18] ICU ah he suffered four heart
[22:21] attacks um pray to God to touch him and
[22:25] heal him amen so I will leave that here
[22:28] here and then we have one other that's
[22:31] also it's also been performed here
[22:34] before amongst our congregation BR
[22:38] brother Daly is missing his wallet and
[22:41] how many times have has God given us
[22:43] back our keys and our wallets and we
[22:47] witnessed a car being returned one time
[22:49] that was stolen at a at a at an old
[22:51] church so it's not impossible amen it's
[22:54] not impossible at all and we'll hold our
[22:57] faith with you on that as well so if we

[47:34] and then question and answer in August
[47:36] the 24th yesterday we have a wonderful
[47:39] time together and it's amazing how God
[47:43] can use one service for somebody who was
[47:45] sitting in the sun Booth to just preach
[47:48] the gospel in and another way just to
[47:51] give somebody a hope so if that man can

[48:25] everything I will try
[48:28] to finish the reading of the
[48:31] scripture I will try by God's grace amen
[48:35] let's go to our
[48:39] scripture glory to
[48:42] God I wanted to move on where I promised
[48:45] to get to finish with David and get into
[48:48] Christ and uh we were reading our Bible
[48:52] before going to
[48:54] bed and my wife happened to read Psalm
[48:58] 105 and as soon as she started reading
[49:02] it the ho the spirit of the Lord came
[49:05] down and it's like somebody opening a
[49:07] new door she doesn't know it till
[49:11] now and I say well it's going to be
[49:14] something like this and uh it was just
[49:17] one
[49:19] minute the way we look at time and the
[49:22] way God work with time is
[49:25] different that's why brother BR I'm say
[49:27] you might dream a long dream but truly
[49:31] you only did it in 3
[49:33] seconds so your timing is not the timing
[49:36] of Eternity one minute can give me 24
[49:40] sermon one
[49:43] minute and as the Lord spoke to me it
[49:45] was just one minute less than one minute
[49:48] I saw it then I went and I sat down and
[49:51] the quat begin to come 1 2 3 4 5 six so
[49:54] I have to put everything I was supposed
[49:56] to Preach Today I push it for next week
[50:00] so let me try if I can read the
[50:02] scripture and finish it we okay so let's

[51:57] amen the Bible says and
[52:01] Moses say to the
[52:04] Lord oh my
[52:06] Lord I am not
[52:09] eloquent don't you think God knew
[52:14] that in other word he's telling God
[52:17] you're making a
[52:19] mistake because here we are at the
[52:21] burning
[52:22] bush God is commissioning
[52:25] Moses he is calling him and say hey
[52:27] you're the man that are qualified for
[52:29] the job and Moses is looking at God he
[52:31] say wait a minute maybe you miss suod
[52:35] something or you missed something when
[52:37] you were looking at your
[52:39] computer did you realize that I'm not
[52:42] eloquent you might be
[52:44] seated God when he calls you
[52:50] amen amen amen when he speak to you amen
[52:54] he knows you better than yourself
[52:57] amen
[52:59] amen amen amen amen amen God doesn't
[53:03] make a mistake when God speak to
[53:07] you through a
[53:10] preacher through his word through a
[53:14] prophet it means that you are already
[53:18] [Applause]
[53:20] qualified so you might as well quit
[53:22] looking at yourself and look at the one
[53:25] who's talking
[53:26] because that man never make a mistake
[53:29] even though you think he's making a
[53:32] mistake God never make a mistake he sees
[53:35] beyond your
[53:37] weaknesses beyond your
[53:40] limitation beyond your
[53:43] impossible what seems impossible amen
[53:46] Baba you can make it possible amen
[53:50] that's the god that we serve his name is
[53:53] Jesus
[53:54] Christ he open ways where there seems to
[53:57] be no
[53:59] ways how can you talk to a man who have
[54:02] a problem in his mouth to be a
[54:08] preacher amen amen amen amen didn't you
[54:12] notice that this boy struggle since he
[54:14] was a young man come on and this is the
[54:17] one you choose that's right of course
[54:21] Moses in the presence of God see why I
[54:24] told you it's hard I don't know if I'm
[54:25] going to finish my
[54:28] scripture verse 10 and Moses said to the
[54:31] Lord oh my
[54:33] Lord I am not
[54:36] eloquent neither he to for in other word
[54:40] neither in the past amen nor since you
[54:45] have spoken to your servant so in the
[54:48] past I was not eloquent when you talking
[54:50] to me right now even after you finish
[54:52] talking to me nothing have changed that
[54:56] not God's problem when he spoke that
[55:00] said it's
[55:02] finished amen amen amen amen stop
[55:06] looking at your
[55:11] weaknesses God knows
[55:14] you amen amen he says before in the past
[55:18] I was not arrogant you just finished
[55:20] talking to me don't you see how I'm
[55:22] stuttering I'm still not able to speak
[55:28] amen glory to God he to for nor since
[55:33] you have spoken to your servant but I am
[55:38] slow of
[55:39] speech and of a what slow
[55:44] Tong and the Lord said to him who has
[55:50] made men's mouth is that way who you
[55:54] talking to
[55:57] who created you who created your
[56:02] mouth the part of the body that have a
[56:05] problem who created
[56:08] it when you were born you think I didn't
[56:10] see what the devil was
[56:13] doing that defect that you use as an
[56:16] excuse before serving the lord don't you
[56:19] think I already seen
[56:21] that who make human being who fabricate
[56:26] who
[56:27] manufacture human
[56:33] being I hope you're catching
[56:36] something the Lord say who has made his
[56:40] mouth men's mouth I'm sorry or who makes
[56:44] the
[56:45] dumb or death or the sin or the blind
[56:51] have not I the
[56:54] Lord God right here is telling Moses
[56:58] something you can read this and continue
[57:01] and you will miss something let's read
[57:04] it
[57:05] again verse 11 and the Lord said to him
[57:09] who has made man's
[57:12] mouth God is revealing to Moses as a
[57:19] Creator amen that's it that's
[57:23] it the one who can make a MTH
[57:26] is not a
[57:28] manufacturer only God can make
[57:30] somebody's mouth in other word Moses I
[57:33] am a God that
[57:37] creates Moses I am a god of
[57:42] creation amen I create
[57:46] things amen number
[57:49] two he says who makes the dam or death
[57:55] or or the scene or the Bland in other
[57:59] word I am not only a god of creation but
[58:04] I am also a god of
[58:09] Miracle amen if you need me to create
[58:13] something I can do it amen if you need a
[58:17] miracle I can do
[58:20] it so God in the ministry of
[58:24] Moses is a God that can
[58:27] create and a God that can do
[58:31] Miracle he's telling Moses in your
[58:34] ministry you will have a portion of me
[58:37] creating things and a portion of me
[58:40] fulfilling
[58:42] wonders all
[58:46] miracles are we together are we
[58:49] together have not di the Lord verse 12
[58:53] now therefore go
[58:58] did you fix my mouth no no the way your
[59:02] mouth
[59:04] look go just that way no I thought you
[59:07] need to fix my
[59:10] speeches just go with that
[59:12] weakness because that weakness is what I
[59:15] trap the devil
[59:18] with when the devil sees your weaknesses
[59:21] he will underestimate
[59:24] you and through the weakness is the very
[59:28] spot I'm going to whoop the
[59:30] [Applause]
[59:32] devil that's why Paul say when I am weak
[59:36] that's when I am strong when Jesus is
[59:39] hungry after fasting and he's may be
[59:42] walking a little bit like this the devil
[59:45] thought I can whoop Jesus Christ he made
[59:47] the greatest mistake that he ever made
[59:50] because when he approached Jesus Christ
[59:53] in his weakness that when Christ was
[59:56] even
[59:57] stronger and he went back again and he
[1:00:00] said it is written when the devil touch
[1:00:03] he say I never felt such
[1:00:05] electricity this one is not Moses this
[1:00:09] is not Elijah who is this man he say
[1:00:12] Satan you shall not tempt the Lord your
[1:00:14] God in other word I am God you don't
[1:00:18] tempt me even if I am weak I am still
[1:00:22] God in human
[1:00:23] flesh and you are God
[1:00:26] [Applause]
[1:00:27] you are a god even when you weak great
[1:00:32] is in that is in you than he that is in
[1:00:36] the
[1:00:37] [Applause]
[1:00:41] world are we together are we together
[1:00:44] don't never underestimate yourself look
[1:00:47] at the man on the inside he's bigger he
[1:00:51] created everything he is God he's called
[1:00:55] The Holy ghost it is Christ in you the
[1:00:59] hope of
[1:01:00] glory are we together are we
[1:01:04] together
[1:01:08] Hallelujah where are we at verse 12
[1:01:11] verse 12 now therefore go and I will be
[1:01:15] with your
[1:01:18] mouth your weakness there in other word
[1:01:21] I'm going to ride on that weakness you
[1:01:24] say your problem is the MTH
[1:01:26] God didn't say I will be with your hand
[1:01:28] okay I'm going to use you I will be
[1:01:30] where the problem is so I can grab the
[1:01:33] devil very
[1:01:34] [Applause]
[1:01:36] well amen amen am Moses was so dangerous
[1:01:41] to the
[1:01:43] devil until when he
[1:01:47] died and his body was left without any
[1:01:51] life the devil seek for the body he say
[1:01:54] no no no this one even when he's dead
[1:01:56] he's more dangerous let me where is his
[1:02:00] body yet because the same thing happened
[1:02:03] with Jesus Christ as he dies and they
[1:02:07] put him on the cross that is when he
[1:02:09] goes on the head quarter of
[1:02:12] hell and destroy everything so the
[1:02:16] deeper the devil is taking you the more
[1:02:19] powerful you going to destroy him
[1:02:26] are we together are we
[1:02:31] together where are we at my friend verse
[1:02:33] 13 now therefore he says no verse 12 now
[1:02:37] therefore I will be with your mouth and
[1:02:40] do what and teach thee what Thou shalt
[1:02:43] say I'm going to teach you somebody's
[1:02:46] receiving an answer right here for a
[1:02:48] question and answer I have not touch it
[1:02:50] yet amen I will teach you what you shall
[1:02:53] do what say so when Moses is say who's
[1:02:56] saying
[1:03:00] God so keep looking at Moses and you
[1:03:03] will realize who's talking through Moses
[1:03:06] because the mouth of Moses have become
[1:03:08] the mouth of
[1:03:11] God and the word of Moses become the
[1:03:14] word of
[1:03:17] God are we together are we
[1:03:22] together verse 13 and he said oh oh my
[1:03:26] Lord this is us here send I pray you by
[1:03:30] the hand of him whom you will what do
[1:03:33] you know what that means in another
[1:03:34] words send somebody
[1:03:36] else despite everything that you're
[1:03:39] saying I mean no no no no I don't
[1:03:42] qualify good luck amen when God chose
[1:03:47] you you don't have a
[1:03:50] choice you don't even have an
[1:03:53] option when God already said it's you
[1:03:57] there is no other option you better Just
[1:03:59] Surrender because God when he made his
[1:04:03] decision he cannot change that decision
[1:04:06] if he changes the decision he's no
[1:04:08] longer God so your excuse is you trying
[1:04:11] to make him not a god when he's a God so
[1:04:15] you better just surrender to him because
[1:04:17] he's not going to back up are we
[1:04:20] together are we together
[1:04:25] 14 and the anger of the Lord was kindled
[1:04:29] against
[1:04:30] Moses and he said is not Aaron delivered
[1:04:35] your brother I know that he can speak
[1:04:39] well in other word I
[1:04:42] know and
[1:04:44] also behold he comes forth to meet you
[1:04:47] it's a prophetic now and when he sees
[1:04:50] you he will be glad in his
[1:04:53] heart and you shall speak to
[1:04:57] him amen and put word in his
[1:05:06] mouth I hope I'm going to even be able
[1:05:08] to touch this amen and put word in his
[1:05:12] mouth and I will be with your
[1:05:16] mouth and with his mouth and will teach
[1:05:20] you what you shall
[1:05:24] do we found subject we have five
[1:05:27] garments follow me carefully now the
[1:05:30] first one is a coat of many
[1:05:34] color
[1:05:36] amen Oh Oh Glory to God the second one
[1:05:41] is a
[1:05:42] servant or a
[1:05:45] slave the third one is Joseph as a
[1:05:50] prisoner the fourth one is Joseph
[1:05:53] changing garment to appear here before
[1:05:58] Pharaoh amen and the last one is Joseph
[1:06:03] wearing fine lining from Pharaoh Joseph
[1:06:07] adopted in his
[1:06:10] position we took this garment through
[1:06:13] Joseph through Jesus Christ through
[1:06:17] Elisha through Paul through David
[1:06:21] through Israel through Joshua through
[1:06:25] Rebeca through Rachel through Zora and
[1:06:29] the woman in Chicago even unto
[1:06:33] roof here we dealing with a Man Called
[1:06:37] Moses when we look at the beginning of
[1:06:40] Moses as we looking at the
[1:06:44] screen before we get to where God is
[1:06:47] empowering him amen his birth is very
[1:06:54] peculiar the the Bible says in the book
[1:06:56] of Exodus chapter 2 verse1 and there
[1:07:00] went a man of the house of Levi and took
[1:07:03] two wife a daughter of Levi so Moses
[1:07:06] came from the tribe of Levi and the
[1:07:09] woman conceived and be a son and when
[1:07:13] she saw him that he was a goodly
[1:07:16] child she hid him three mon so the
[1:07:21] reason why they hid Moses is because he
[1:07:24] was goodly
[1:07:27] what does goodly mean Act 7 verse 20 the
[1:07:31] Bible say in which time Moses was born
[1:07:35] and was exceeding fair in other words
[1:07:39] Moses was a handsome
[1:07:42] boy a beautiful
[1:07:45] baby just like
[1:07:48] David sir just like
[1:07:52] Joseph are we together EX inly Fair he
[1:07:56] was very beautiful and nished up into
[1:07:59] his father house how many month three
[1:08:02] months do you had a child just because
[1:08:05] he's
[1:08:06] beautiful what does he really mean in
[1:08:09] the book of Hebrew chapter 11 verse 23
[1:08:13] the Bible say by
[1:08:15] faith Moses when he was born was he
[1:08:19] three month of his parent so this hiding
[1:08:24] was coule with Revelation that's right
[1:08:27] because it happened by
[1:08:30] faith amen it was not just because the
[1:08:33] child looks beautiful there was a
[1:08:35] revelation that goes with it amen the
[1:08:39] Bible say when he was born he was hid
[1:08:42] three month of his parent because they
[1:08:45] saw he was a proper child so Moses was
[1:08:50] not just
[1:08:52] beautiful but he was a proper child the
[1:08:56] word proper means
[1:08:59] unusual
[1:09:00] peculiar
[1:09:02] strange in other word when you look at
[1:09:05] Moses he's so beautiful and there is
[1:09:08] something strange about
[1:09:11] Moses brother Bram says in the message
[1:09:14] proving his word in 1964 he say but one
[1:09:18] day the predestinated seed was born a
[1:09:22] child that was a proper child there was
[1:09:26] something about him that seems how
[1:09:28] strange so God in your
[1:09:31] making in your Fabrication in your
[1:09:35] creation put something strange about you
[1:09:40] that even you yourself don't
[1:09:43] understand Amen brother Bram says this
[1:09:47] in the message the authority of the word
[1:09:49] he said Moses when he was born he was
[1:09:52] born a proper child God had him brought
[1:09:57] here Moses had nothing to do with it is
[1:10:00] that right John the Baptist how many
[1:10:03] years my friend 712 years before he was
[1:10:07] born he was the voice of one crying in
[1:10:09] the wilderness Jeremiah 1:4 say God told
[1:10:14] Jeremiah before you were even formed in
[1:10:18] your mother's womb I did what I knew you
[1:10:20] and I did what Sanctified you and
[1:10:22] ordained you to be what a prophet over
[1:10:25] the nation how could he help
[1:10:28] it gift and calling are how without
[1:10:31] repentance you are that way because God
[1:10:34] made you that way the way that you look
[1:10:39] strange am strange to your neighbor
[1:10:43] strange to your friend strange to your
[1:10:46] boss strange to people around you it is

[1:10:57] [Applause]
[1:11:00] mystery brother Bram say who taking
[1:11:03] thought can add one kid to his statue
[1:11:07] Why Try to impersonate anything when you
[1:11:10] are just making well you are just doing
[1:11:13] something that is not what right in
[1:11:15] other word don't try to copy
[1:11:18] somebody because the way you are
[1:11:21] peculiar amen there is a purpose because
[1:11:25] of the way you are when you are trying
[1:11:28] to copy something you are actually
[1:11:30] losing God's original
[1:11:33] identity it's something that God put in
[1:11:36] you and God will use that thing so
[1:11:39] Remain the way God created you remove
[1:11:43] what is seen from your life but keep
[1:11:46] your
[1:11:47] originality because God created you T

[1:13:45] now as we continue to look at Moses the
[1:13:49] Bible says here in act chapter 27 that
[1:13:52] he was exceeding Fair now we understand
[1:13:54] that he's peculiar and he was Nish up in
[1:13:57] his father house three month and when he
[1:14:01] was cast out because they can't keep him
[1:14:03] Trouble Is All Around Pharaoh's daughter

[1:14:10] own son Moses was not born an
[1:14:16] Egyptian he was born a
[1:14:20] Hebrew amen when he was taken out and
[1:14:23] put into the water
[1:14:25] God directed with a
[1:14:29] GPS the Ark of Moses all the way to the
[1:14:32] Palace amen when we reach to the Palace
[1:14:36] Moses begin to wear a
[1:14:40] coat a
[1:14:43] jacket are we together different than a
[1:14:46] Hebrew
[1:14:48] jacket Moses begin to wear an Egyptian
[1:14:52] jacket the very name Moses was not given
[1:14:56] by his
[1:14:59] mother it's written in your Bible the
[1:15:02] very name Moses was not given from his
[1:15:05] father nor his uncle he was the daughter
[1:15:09] of pharaoh that gave him the name so he
[1:15:13] got a name from the
[1:15:15] [Applause]
[1:15:17] Egyptian are we together are we together
[1:15:21] he was so indoctrinated as an Egyptian
[1:15:25] until when you look at Moses there is
[1:15:28] nothing about a Hebrew about him he was
[1:15:31] completely an Egyptian he was a Hebrew
[1:15:35] under an Egyptian
[1:15:38] [Applause]
[1:15:39] clothing are we together are we together
[1:15:43] let's go to Exodus chapter 2 my friend
[1:15:46] if we
[1:15:48] can I'm still reading my
[1:15:51] scripture let's go to Exodus chapter 2
[1:15:55] if you dare you can say amen amen go to
[1:15:58] verse 15 the Bible says now when Pharaoh
[1:16:02] heard this he sought to slay Moses amen
[1:16:07] amen but Moses fled from the face of
[1:16:09] pharaoh and dwell in the land of Midian
[1:16:13] and he sat down by a well now the priest
[1:16:16] of
[1:16:17] Midian had seven daughters we went
[1:16:20] through this and they came and Drew
[1:16:23] water and filled the thr to water their
[1:16:26] father's flock we clear and the shepherd
[1:16:30] came and drove them away but Moses stood
[1:16:33] up and helped them and watered their
[1:16:36] flock right here we talking about Moses
[1:16:38] Moses Moses amen

[1:16:54] long before you come at this time what
[1:16:56] happened that today you finish early
[1:16:58] amen amen what happened the business
[1:17:00] went down the company went down they
[1:17:03] turned the power off you clock out what
[1:17:06] happened you got
[1:17:07] fire amen amen what happened verse 20
[1:17:11] and he said to his
[1:17:13] daughter uh verse 19 and they say a
[1:17:17] Hebrew an
[1:17:20] Egyptian a what an Egyptian an Egyptian
[1:17:23] did what delivered us was Moses an
[1:17:26] Egyptian no sir so he was so
[1:17:29] indoctrinated into Egypt until when you
[1:17:32] look at Moses he look like an
[1:17:36] Egyptian if somebody doesn't tell you
[1:17:39] this boy is a Hebrew they look of Moses
[1:17:42] is an
[1:17:43] Egyptian Moses is wearing a
[1:17:49] coat are we together Moses is wearing a
[1:17:52] coat an Egyptian
[1:17:56] jacket amen
[1:17:59] am and this cour he was not an ordinary
[1:18:03] man he was a
[1:18:07] priest because Pharaoh's daughter took
[1:18:11] him are we together are we
[1:18:14] together the Bible says right here that
[1:18:17] Pharaoh's daughter took him up and
[1:18:19] nourish him for her own what son and
[1:18:23] Moses was learn in all the wisdom of
[1:18:27] what the Egyptian even his thinking
[1:18:30] right an Egyptian his speech an Egyptian
[1:18:34] he attire an Egyptian and was mighty in
[1:18:38] what in words and in what and in Deeds
[1:18:40] so whatever Moses does
[1:18:43] works you can beat Moses in an argument
[1:18:46] a powerful man amen everything looking
[1:18:51] like an Egyptian and not only that
[1:18:53] brother BR I'm saying is this he say
[1:18:56] Moses with one foot on the throne that's
[1:19:00] right Moses had to become the next
[1:19:05] Pharaoh he had the Throne of Egypt there
[1:19:09] amen one foot from the throne because he
[1:19:12] was a Mighty Man a powerful man he's
[1:19:15] working for Egypt he has a jacket he's
[1:19:18] wearing with many many many
[1:19:22] abilities amen he's a mighty man he's a
[1:19:26] priest he's going to be the next Pharaoh
[1:19:28] he look handsome he's a good boy
[1:19:30] everything he does is good all this
[1:19:33] manle of Many Colors around
[1:19:37] him are we together a son of pharaoh was
[1:19:42] to become the ruler and he will be the
[1:19:45] chief Captain over the biggest military
[1:19:47] nation in the world that was the world
[1:19:50] at their feet that had the world at
[1:19:51] their feet Egypt was the commercial
[1:19:54] nation of the world at that time and
[1:19:57] Moses with his foot on the throne a
[1:19:59] young man 40 years old could have went
[1:20:02] right into it
[1:20:05] but he chose
[1:20:07] rather because why he look at the word
[1:20:11] of God and he seen God made what the
[1:20:15] promise so if Moses would have continued
[1:20:20] this path right here what would have
[1:20:22] happened to him because our path goes
[1:20:25] through the fth Garment of Joseph
[1:20:28] brother Bram says this again in the
[1:20:30] message faith in action he says why if
[1:20:34] Moses would have took Pharaoh's Throne
[1:20:37] he would have been known as another
[1:20:39] Pharaoh he been gone in torment
[1:20:44] today but he is Immortal among man today
[1:20:50] because he choose rather and put his
[1:20:52] faith how into action so something
[1:20:55] happened to Moses despite all this
[1:20:59] jacket Egyptian jacket that he was
[1:21:01] wearing looking like an Egyptian Talking
[1:21:04] Like An Egyptian reacting like an
[1:21:06] Egyptian even his gesture is the gesture
[1:21:09] of an Egyptian until all the Hebrew was
[1:21:13] taken completely out of him amen yet
[1:21:17] that Mentor have to be
[1:21:20] removed are we together amen are we
[1:21:23] together amen Hebrew 11 verse 24 the
[1:21:27] Bible say by
[1:21:29] Faith by
[1:21:31] Revelation Moses when he was come to
[1:21:34] years he did what refused to be called
[1:21:37] the son of Pharaoh's daughter how can a
[1:21:40] young man with all these ability all
[1:21:43] Egypt behind you all the Mercedes all
[1:21:47] the car all the C like everything is
[1:21:50] behind him all all all all the VIP St
[1:21:55] behind him he stood one day and said no
[1:21:58] I don't want to be
[1:22:00] called the son of the daughter of
[1:22:02] pharaoh anymore what happened to this
[1:22:04] man the Bible say a revelation hid him
[1:22:08] there was a faith that came to
[1:22:10] Moses amen and when that Faith came to
[1:22:14] him Moses decid to remove that
[1:22:19] jacket are we together choosing rather
[1:22:23] to do what suffer Affliction with the
[1:22:26] people of God than to enjoy what the
[1:22:29] pleasures of sin for a season a steeming
[1:22:33] the reproach of who of Christ where did
[1:22:35] he know
[1:22:38] Christ Este steeming the reproach of
[1:22:41] Christ how greater riches than the what
[1:22:43] the treasures in Egypt for he had
[1:22:46] respect unto the recompense of what the
[1:22:49] reward so something struck this boy the
[1:22:52] Boy look he say well I want want to be
[1:22:54] identified with those mad dber over
[1:22:57] there those slave that are there I want
[1:23:00] to become like one of them he want to
[1:23:05] suffer the Bible say choosing rather to
[1:23:08] do what suffer in other words Moses who
[1:23:12] was a priest begin to Envy a
[1:23:16] [Applause]
[1:23:19] slave are we together he only take
[1:23:22] Revelation to move you from one spot to
[1:23:26] the next one it took the dream of Joseph
[1:23:29] to move him from EGT from Canaan to the
[1:23:32] land of Egypt to become a
[1:23:36] slave are we together keep your seat
[1:23:39] belt I'm still claming with this
[1:23:41] airplane my friend the Bible says in Act
[1:23:44] 7 verse 23 and when he was how full 40
[1:23:48] years old 40 years old 40 is a special
[1:23:52] number according to brother Bram brother
[1:23:55] Bram say so every one of them all them
[1:23:58] big degrees they were shivering they
[1:24:01] were scared of that fellow that was
[1:24:03] Goliath 40 days amen so he boasted like
[1:24:07] that for 40 days did you ever notice 40
[1:24:11] is the number of what Temptation
[1:24:13] certainly it is Moses in the mountain
[1:24:16] how many days 40 days come back and was
[1:24:18] tempted Jesus went into the Wilderness
[1:24:21] how many days 40 days and he was tempted
[1:24:23] 40 days is what Temptation rain 40 days
[1:24:27] and so forth 40 is God's number of what
[1:24:29] Temptation three is what a perfect
[1:24:32] number we know that and seven is what
[1:24:34] the completion but 40 is what the
[1:24:36] Temptation you know the mathematics of
[1:24:39] the scripture so at 40 years something
[1:24:43] happened the Bible say it came to his
[1:24:46] heart not his
[1:24:48] head that's why it was a revelation it
[1:24:52] came to his heart to the oh something
[1:24:55] struck Moses to visit what his the
[1:24:59] children of what of Israel and seeing
[1:25:01] one of them suffer wrong he did what he
[1:25:05] defended him and Avenged him that was
[1:25:08] oppressed and did what and smoke the
[1:25:09] Egyptian for he
[1:25:12] supposed his Brethren would have what
[1:25:15] understood how that God by his hand
[1:25:18] would what deliver them but they
[1:25:20] understood it so Moses already have a
[1:25:23] revelation that he's going to be a
[1:25:25] deliverer but in order to be a deliverer
[1:25:28] this jacket need to be taken off he
[1:25:31] begin to express his faith with his
[1:25:35] action because works is the expression
[1:25:38] of Faith he begin to defend the slave of
[1:25:42] an Egyptian even though he look like an
[1:25:45] Egyptian a true child of God that have
[1:25:49] received the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:25:52] will defend another child of God
[1:25:55] regardless of the country he is
[1:25:58] [Applause]
[1:26:02] in do you understand what I'm saying are
[1:26:05] we together are we together glory to God
[1:26:08] the Bible say and the next day he show
[1:26:11] himself unto them as they strove and
[1:26:14] would have set them at one again saying
[1:26:16] sir ye are Brethren why do you wrong one
[1:26:19] another in other word he goes back he
[1:26:20] two he see two slave fighting he say h
[1:26:23] you in distress
[1:26:27] fighting so this whooping is not enough
[1:26:30] for
[1:26:30] [Applause]
[1:26:32] you amen not only he was defending but
[1:26:37] he tried to also get in the midst of him
[1:26:40] as a
[1:26:42] pastor to settle the issue they didn't
[1:26:46] understand his
[1:26:47] language Israel turn him around amen the
[1:26:51] Bible says but he that did his nebor for
[1:26:54] what wrong the one that was guilty amen
[1:26:57] trust him away saying who made the What
[1:27:01] ruler and what a judge over
[1:27:04] us so this guy understood something when
[1:27:09] Moses came and begin to judge them he
[1:27:11] say
[1:27:12] hey who made the
[1:27:15] judge amen who made the judge and ruler
[1:27:21] amen who made you our leader
[1:27:25] amen he rejected that leadership amen
[1:27:29] because Joseph brother when he came he
[1:27:31] said I saw a dream that's
[1:27:33] right all your Chief were bowing down
[1:27:36] they say
[1:27:37] hey so you going to be a ruler of it
[1:27:41] us you going to have dominion over us
[1:27:44] amen he say I see 11 say so you taking
[1:27:48] over us so this is the same scenario
[1:27:51] they telling Moses they say hey so you
[1:27:52] want to take over us who told you you
[1:27:55] going to be our
[1:27:57] boss amen and usually it's those that
[1:28:01] are
[1:28:02] guilty that have a tendency to fight God
[1:28:07] [Applause]
[1:28:08] leadership are we together are we
[1:28:11] together the Bible says that this Moses
[1:28:15] whom they
[1:28:16] refuse saying who made the a ruler and a
[1:28:19] judge the same did God send to be how
[1:28:23] ruler and what a deliverer by the hand
[1:28:25] of an Angel which appeared to who him in
[1:28:27] the bush so no matter how much you
[1:28:29] reject that Authority one day he will
[1:28:32] cut you down no matter how much Joseph
[1:28:35] brother rejected to be dominated or
[1:28:39] ruled by Joseph one of these day they
[1:28:41] were bowing down to Joseph because God
[1:28:44] Vision will
[1:28:45] happen regardless of the
[1:28:49] circumstances the Bible says in Exodus
[1:28:52] 11 verse three he says the Lord gave the
[1:28:56] people favor in the sight of the
[1:28:59] Egyptian moreover the man Moses was how
[1:29:02] very great in the land of what of Egypt
[1:29:05] and the sight of Pharaoh's servant and
[1:29:07] in the sight of what the people so Moses
[1:29:10] something happened to him he killed
[1:29:12] somebody and when Israel rejected him
[1:29:16] completely like who told you you're
[1:29:17] going to be leading uh H I mean uh be a
[1:29:20] leader for us Moses say uhhh my life is
[1:29:24] in danger here let me run away amen he
[1:29:28] run away what happened to him brother
[1:29:30] Bram said God always had someone he
[1:29:34] could put his hand
[1:29:36] on Moses was born a Propet child and God
[1:29:40] ordained that he should bring Israel out
[1:29:43] under his leadership and before he went
[1:29:47] down to Egypt before he become a leader
[1:29:51] before he get to the position God
[1:29:55] predestinated him to be before he's
[1:29:58] adopted before he start the very purpose
[1:30:02] that God sent him to be on this Earth
[1:30:06] before he went down into Egypt after he
[1:30:09] was CAU when he was on the desert that
[1:30:12] morning doing what hurting Jethro sheep
[1:30:14] we find that Moses moved from a
[1:30:19] priest are we together are we together
[1:30:22] and run away from a priest and become a
[1:30:25] servant to his
[1:30:28] father-in-law he become gent Shepherd he
[1:30:32] got a job with Jetro so the very big
[1:30:36] priest here lost his identity he lost
[1:30:39] that cat of the Egyptian he he's now
[1:30:42] back as a Hebrew and as a Hebrew he
[1:30:45] became a servant to his
[1:30:47] father-in-law are we together are we
[1:30:50] together the Bible say he was that
[1:30:52] morning hearding
[1:30:54] ship his father-in-law he saw a bush a
[1:30:57] burning now I believe that was the first
[1:31:00] appearance of the Angel of the Lord
[1:31:03] Brother Bram continue he said Moses a
[1:31:06] Runway servant he was supposed to
[1:31:09] deliver the children of Israel but he
[1:31:11] ran away and he didn't know how to do it
[1:31:14] his military training would not let him
[1:31:17] do it but one day he did what he met God
[1:31:20] he was what a changed man and a man
[1:31:23] meets God he makes him act how different
[1:31:26] than he ever did act could you imagine
[1:31:29] Moses how ridiculous when you meet God
[1:31:33] what will he make you act Billy did you
[1:31:36] say we had 10 minute about 10 minutes I
[1:31:39] don't have 10 minutes I have more than
[1:31:40] 10 minutes here one day he's a
[1:31:44] shephers a what a prince of Egypt run
[1:31:47] away on the backside of the desert back
[1:31:50] on the backside of the desert doing what
[1:31:52] hurting sheep afraid to go to Israel or
[1:31:55] to go to Egypt rather and here he is on
[1:31:59] the back side of what the desert so God
[1:32:01] allow Moses to move from this good VIP
[1:32:05] position and to become a servant and as
[1:32:09] a servant he become a
[1:32:12] Shepherd like David he begin to keep
[1:32:15] sheep for a reason are we together are
[1:32:19] we together glory to God brother BR the
[1:32:22] Bible says in exod three and Moses kept
[1:32:26] the flock of Jetro his father-in-law the
[1:32:29] priest of Midian and he led the flock to
[1:32:31] the backside of the desert and came to a
[1:32:34] mountain of God even to what so there
[1:32:38] was a period of time that Moses have to
[1:32:42] serve under his
[1:32:43] father-in-law amen and he serve him as a
[1:32:47] Shepherd because God had a mystery
[1:32:50] laying with him being a Shepherd because
[1:32:53] one day he's going to be the shepherd of
[1:32:55] Israel so God put him into a job that
[1:32:59] will prepare him for his future
[1:33:03] task Moses will lead the flock from
[1:33:06] Egypt to the promised land and God
[1:33:09] remove his mantle of Egypt the training
[1:33:12] of Egypt and put him under a training of
[1:33:15] a true Shepherd who understand a sheep
[1:33:18] who also smell like a Sheep
[1:33:22] amen amen amen before he can lead the
[1:33:25] people of God are we together so when
[1:33:29] his St of this period of time this
[1:33:33] season
[1:33:35] finished God led him to mount HB to the
[1:33:39] Mountain of God this is where we are on
[1:33:41] our reading what happened over there he
[1:33:44] saw the burning bush what did the
[1:33:46] burning bush do to Moses brother Bram
[1:33:49] say Moses became a what a prisoner
[1:33:55] Hallelujah are we together amen are we
[1:33:58] together amen Moses the priest became
[1:34:01] the servant and from the servant he
[1:34:04] become what a
[1:34:08] prisoner are we together are we together
[1:34:12] maybe somebody begin to catch now he
[1:34:14] became a what prisoner he confessed he
[1:34:16] could not even what this is where we are
[1:34:20] finally when God got him in his hand
[1:34:24] where he could only move where God moved
[1:34:28] him where he taught him what word he
[1:34:31] know it he was what the word then he
[1:34:34] submitted himself to what the word and
[1:34:36] the Holy Spirit there God harness who
[1:34:39] Moses to what the will of God so God was
[1:34:42] molding
[1:34:43] Moses for his future task and at the
[1:34:47] burning bush God hold him as a prisoner
[1:34:51] brother brandham continues to make it
[1:34:53] more clear
[1:34:54] he say he seen the word not the ambition
[1:34:58] of the people or the desire of the
[1:35:01] people then what did he became he did
[1:35:04] not want to face what the Egyptians
[1:35:06] anymore he did not want to face this
[1:35:09] thing anymore but he became how a
[1:35:11] prisoner a man 40 Years of running
[1:35:14] stripping down but then he became a what
[1:35:17] a prisoner at the what the burning bush
[1:35:19] so at the Burning Bush Moses became a
[1:35:22] prisoner from a prince to a servant from
[1:35:25] a servant to a prisoner amen before he
[1:35:29] goes back to
[1:35:32] Egypt and to appear before who Pharaoh
[1:35:35] are we together are we together are we
[1:35:39] together before he goes back to Egypt to
[1:35:41] appear before who Pharaoh glory to God
[1:35:44] brother Bram say he become a what a
[1:35:47] prisoner at the burning bush the Mary
[1:35:49] Moses with all his what intellect the
[1:35:52] Bible saying that Moses was a m man in
[1:35:55] word or In Deed down where in Egypt now
[1:35:59] we are at the burning bush this is what
[1:36:01] we were reading I just gave you the
[1:36:03] background of it so you understand so we
[1:36:06] are in the place where Moses now is a
[1:36:09] prisoner are we together and God at the
[1:36:12] burning bush give him two
[1:36:15] sons are we together are we together God
[1:36:19] told Moses take your stick and throw it
[1:36:23] in the ground
[1:36:24] and when you throw it in the ground
[1:36:25] what's going to happen it's going to
[1:36:27] turn to a snake amen so he was a god of
[1:36:32] Miracle are we together which was the
[1:36:35] first fool that was given to him are we
[1:36:37] there and then the second time God told
[1:36:40] him take your hand and brother Bram say
[1:36:42] he was the right hand and put it in the
[1:36:45] bosom which is over the heart Amen in
[1:36:49] other words the word is going to the
[1:36:50] heart for the
[1:36:52] discernment which was the Second Son
[1:36:54] which was the second po are we together
[1:36:58] now we are at the burning bush God is
[1:37:01] trying to send Moses Moses said no no no
[1:37:03] no no no no no no I don't qualify to
[1:37:06] this and God say you know what I going
[1:37:09] to be with your
[1:37:10] mouth amen and I'm going to send you a
[1:37:14] your your brother he's also a and when
[1:37:17] your brother comes both you and your
[1:37:20] brother I'm going to use your mouth and
[1:37:22] I'm going to teach you what to do amen
[1:37:25] let's go back now to Exodus 4 and let's
[1:37:28] pick up where we stop we were on verse
[1:37:30] 15 let's go to verse
[1:37:33] 16 are we together glory to God if you
[1:37:38] there you can say amen amen verse
[1:37:42] 16 let's go to 15 so you pick up easily
[1:37:45] the Bible say and you shall speak to him
[1:37:48] and put words in his mouth and I will be
[1:37:52] with your mouth
[1:37:53] and with his mouth and will teach you
[1:37:56] both of you what you shall do watch
[1:37:59] verse
[1:38:01] 16 slowly you there amen you there amen
[1:38:06] and he shall be your
[1:38:10] spokeman to the
[1:38:13] people are you there and he shall be
[1:38:18] even he shall be to you in not the word
[1:38:21] error will be to you you Moses a
[1:38:25] spokeman Aaron God is saying that Moses
[1:38:29] Aaron your brother is going to be a
[1:38:33] spokeman amen your
[1:38:36] spokeman A spokeman for
[1:38:39] you amen a we there amen he said Aaron
[1:38:44] shall be your
[1:38:46] spokesman
[1:38:48] Amen to the people and he shall be even
[1:38:53] he shall be to you instead of a what a
[1:38:57] mouth are we together so Aaron is not
[1:39:02] only Moses
[1:39:04] spokesman but he is also the
[1:39:08] mouth of
[1:39:11] Moses amen so the
[1:39:15] mouth of Moses was a human
[1:39:20] being am I reading a different Bible
[1:39:24] am I reading a different Bible amen the
[1:39:27] mouth of Moses was a human
[1:39:32] being so when you look at Aaron it's the
[1:39:35] mouth of
[1:39:36] [Applause]
[1:39:40] Moses are we together are we together am
[1:39:43] are we together amen continue more he
[1:39:47] shall be your spokesman to the people
[1:39:50] and he shall be even he shall be to you
[1:39:52] as what a a mouth as a mouth and you
[1:39:57] shall be to him instead of what God so
[1:40:02] Moses amen now is
[1:40:07] God Amen and the mouth of
[1:40:12] Moses are you following me is a human
[1:40:18] being let me rephrase it because this
[1:40:20] need to go down Moses is a god this God
[1:40:26] also is a human
[1:40:28] being
[1:40:30] amen are you together are we together so
[1:40:33] God is a human being and his mouth is a
[1:40:37] human
[1:40:40] being are we together Moses became God a
[1:40:45] human being so when you see a human
[1:40:47] being
[1:40:50] walking that's God
[1:40:54] if you have a difficulty it happen in
[1:40:57] the person of Jesus Christ Jesus Christ
[1:41:00] was God in human
[1:41:03] flesh are we are we together are we
[1:41:06] together so when Moses is coming Moses
[1:41:09] is a
[1:41:10] God and the mouth of Moses also is a
[1:41:13] human being so both God and his mouth a
[1:41:18] human
[1:41:20] being God is a human being and his MTH
[1:41:23] is a human being that's why brother Bram
[1:41:26] say a
[1:41:27] prophet is God's MTH piece because God
[1:41:33] MTH is a human
[1:41:37] being are we together are we together
[1:41:41] are we together one person a human being
[1:41:44] is a God the other person is the
[1:41:46] spokesman of the God who is actually the
[1:41:49] mouth of God so a prophet is a mouth of
[1:41:53] God it's a human being are we together
[1:41:57] what are you trying to drive there my
[1:41:59] friend let's go now we got Exodus 16
[1:42:03] let's go to Exodus 6 our second
[1:42:08] thing God a human being amen amen his
[1:42:13] mouth a human
[1:42:17] being so the mouth of God is a
[1:42:21] man and God is a man
[1:42:24] am amen amen amen amen amen amen then
[1:42:30] the Lord verse one six say to Moses
[1:42:34] we're going very
[1:42:35] good then the Lord said to Moses now
[1:42:39] shall you see what I will do to
[1:42:42] Pharaoh for with a strong hand shall he
[1:42:46] let them go and with a strong hand shall
[1:42:49] he drive them out of his land
[1:42:53] and God spoke to Moses and say to
[1:42:58] him I am the Lord follow me
[1:43:03] carefully and I appeared to
[1:43:07] Abraham go ahead my friend and to who
[1:43:11] Isaac God appeared to Abraham God
[1:43:15] appeared to be to who Isaac and to who
[1:43:18] Jacob continue by the name of God
[1:43:21] Almighty in the name of what God
[1:43:24] almighty God
[1:43:27] almighty continue my friend but by my
[1:43:29] name
[1:43:30] Jehovah was I not known to
[1:43:33] them God is bringing a new revelation to
[1:43:40] Moses he said
[1:43:42] Moses Abraham appeared to him as a
[1:43:46] mighty
[1:43:47] man as a mighty God I appeared to Isaac
[1:43:52] as a mighty God I'm the Almighty I
[1:43:55] appear to Jacob as the almighty but
[1:43:58] there was a revelation that I never show
[1:44:02] Abraham I never show Isaac I never show
[1:44:06] even Jacob that Revelation I'm going to
[1:44:09] show it to
[1:44:10] you Abraham doesn't know this face of me
[1:44:15] right Isaac never knew this corner right
[1:44:19] here I show Abraham myself to a certain
[1:44:23] level I show Isaac to myself to a
[1:44:27] certain level Jacob to a certain level
[1:44:29] by you I'm going to show you more than
[1:44:32] almighty
[1:44:33] God I'm going to reveal to you as
[1:44:38] Jehovah are we together that's why he
[1:44:41] say I appear to Abraham to Isaac and to
[1:44:46] Jacob by the name of God Almighty else
[1:44:50] sh I amen but by my name Jehovah are we
[1:44:55] there was that not known unto them in
[1:44:58] other word if you go to Abraham you say

[1:45:11] renew me and I became young again if you
[1:45:13] ask is do you know sh he say yes I know
[1:45:16] sh you ask Jacob yes I know sh but if
[1:45:19] you ask them do you know Jehovah
[1:45:23] Abraham scratches his head he said what
[1:45:25] are you talking about if you ask ISAC
[1:45:28] did you ever hear about Jehovah is say
[1:45:32] who is Jehovah if you ask Jacob Jacob
[1:45:35] say I never heard such a name who is
[1:45:40] Jehovah are we together because God is a
[1:45:44] human being amen and his mouth also is a
[1:45:47] human
[1:45:49] being amen this is the first time God is
[1:45:53] talking to a human being and telling him
[1:45:55] you going to be a God I never told
[1:45:58] Abraham he's going to be a God I never
[1:46:01] told Isaac he's going to be a God I

[1:50:31] Word a written word you can have it and
[1:50:34] you remain sick but a Living Word can
[1:50:38] tell you in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:50:41] rise up and
[1:50:44] [Applause]
[1:50:51] walk Hallelujah The Living Word can tell

[1:51:04] it oh my God oh my
[1:51:08] God are we together are we together
[1:51:12] brother Bram say that when the Methodist

[1:54:05] are we
[1:54:06] together brother Kelly I don't know if I
[1:54:08] going to continue this is getting
[1:54:12] stronger I'm saying but
[1:54:15] he from God as well but of course that
[1:54:20] bride will be how repudiated as in the
[1:54:25] what God is telling Moses I'm going to
[1:54:28] do something with you that Abraham
[1:54:31] doesn't
[1:54:32] know Isaac doesn't know Jacob doesn't
[1:54:36] know what are you trying to do I'm going
[1:54:39] to show you that my name is
[1:54:44] Jehovah are we together what does
[1:54:47] Jehovah
[1:54:50] mean what is this Revelation called
[1:54:53] Jehovah we heard about Jehovah Witnesses
[1:54:56] what is Jehovah how can God say Moses
[1:54:59] I'm going to unfold myself I'm going to
[1:55:01] show you something this one Abraham
[1:55:03] doesn't know the father of your
[1:55:07] faith doesn't know this one amen do you
[1:55:10] see why the devil was looking for even
[1:55:12] the the the body of Moses because Moses
[1:55:16] have something
[1:55:18] higher than Abraham until Moses Israel
[1:55:23] the Lord your
[1:55:25] God will send you a prophet like
[1:55:31] me so Jesus has to be like
[1:55:39] Moses that's why when you speak about
[1:55:42] Moses the Jews pick up the
[1:55:45] stone because you're talking to somebody
[1:55:48] differently God say listen I talk to
[1:55:51] Abraham
[1:55:52] I talk to Isaac I talk to Jacob but to
[1:55:59] you when I talk to you I remove my
[1:56:04] glasses so you can see me very
[1:56:07] [Applause]
[1:56:10] well I know it's hard my friend put your
[1:56:13] seat belt one is
[1:56:17] Jehovah oh Lord help me up oh brother BR
[1:56:21] says in the message adoption he says in
[1:56:24] Genesis 2 when he made men he says I am
[1:56:30] y a h u j u v u h who Y which means what
[1:56:40] Jehovah what did he
[1:56:44] mean I am all existing
[1:56:48] one who created something of
[1:56:53] myself to be a what son of mine a what
[1:56:57] temporary and what an amateur a little
[1:57:00] what one of mine Glory brother Bram said
[1:57:04] Jehovah means that God created something
[1:57:09] in his own
[1:57:12] image in his own
[1:57:17] likeness something that look like him
[1:57:20] that came from him
[1:57:22] and that can take his place and act like
[1:57:29] God hallelujah don't worry my friend I
[1:57:32] hope you're going to swallow this
[1:57:33] brother Bram say Glory he says why he
[1:57:38] said Jehovah means that he gave man to
[1:57:42] be a what amateur God so Jehovah is God
[1:57:47] making human
[1:57:50] God that's why he thought Moses you GL
[1:57:55] I'm going to send you over there but
[1:57:57] with a different Revelation this one
[1:58:00] Abraham doesn't know Isaac doesn't know
[1:58:03] Jacob doesn't know it is a revelation of
[1:58:07] deity in human
[1:58:10] being Jehovah means God is making other

[2:00:29] Pharaoh in other word whatever you say
[2:00:32] will

[2:09:37] Sheep he said Matthew 22 verse 41 to
[2:09:41] verse what 46 he says while the Pharisee
[2:09:45] were gathered together Jesus asked them
[2:09:49] you follow me say
[2:09:52] what do you think of
[2:09:55] Christ now it's not the Pharisee asking
[2:09:58] question it is God asking the
[2:10:01] Pharisees he said I have a question for
[2:10:04] you you've been asking me question all
[2:10:06] along now I have a question to you what
[2:10:09] is your question what do you think of
[2:10:13] Christ according to your scripture to
[2:10:17] your Old Testament you know who Christ
[2:10:19] is what do you think Christ
[2:10:22] is amen amen amen they say unto him the
[2:10:28] what the son of David oh Christ yes yes
[2:10:31] yes I know the answer Christ is the son
[2:10:34] of
[2:10:38] David because he's the root and The
[2:10:41] Offspring of
[2:10:43] David the way they were answering Jesus
[2:10:45] Christ was that Christ is going to be a
[2:10:48] man that is born by sex
[2:10:53] amen and a child of David Jesus said no
[2:10:57] problem he says unto them how
[2:11:01] then do David in the spirit in word
[2:11:06] under the anointing you cannot deny the
[2:11:09] anointing of David the Pharisees say no
[2:11:12] no no no no David was the servant of the
[2:11:14] Lord do you know David was a prophet say
[2:11:16] yeah yeah yeah yes we know David so do
[2:11:18] you remember the psalm and whatever
[2:11:20] David wrote was under the spirit of God
[2:11:22] the Pharisees say yes yes yes yes Jesus
[2:11:24] say no problem so now
[2:11:26] David under the spirit of God under the
[2:11:30] anointing that you Pharisee recognize
[2:11:33] amen David in the spirit call
[2:11:38] Christ that son of David he call him
[2:11:41] what Lord saying the what Lord say unto
[2:11:45] who my Lord sit down unto th right hand
[2:11:49] until th make th enemy what th foot
[2:11:52] David say you know Christ God was
[2:11:55] talking to
[2:11:58] Christ are we together and God told
[2:12:02] Christ but when God is talking to Christ
[2:12:05] he say
[2:12:07] Lord and Christ say
[2:12:13] Lord are we together put your seat Bel
[2:12:16] my friend because we're going to lay
[2:12:17] this seep down amen amen he said then
[2:12:20] then the Lord said unto the Lord sit th
[2:12:23] way on my right hand until I make th
[2:12:26] enemy what thy foot if David then call
[2:12:30] him
[2:12:33] Lord how can he be his
[2:12:36] son in other word how can David call a
[2:12:40] human being God because Lord means eloh
[2:12:45] him and that human being you saying me
[2:12:49] you told me it's the son of David
[2:12:51] but how can David look at a human being
[2:12:54] and say hey that human being is Elohim
[2:12:57] how can a human being be
[2:13:01] God are we together amen are we together
[2:13:04] amen are we together amen verse 46 and
[2:13:07] no man was able to answer him word
[2:13:10] because the answer cannot come from them
[2:13:12] it is time to shut the critic MTH
[2:13:15] [Applause]
[2:13:18] off and the way you shut them off it is
[2:13:23] when you become
[2:13:26] God when you get into
[2:13:29] D everybody back off even the devil
[2:13:32] backs off amen he says no man was able
[2:13:36] to answer him a what a word nether D any
[2:13:41] man from that
[2:13:44] day amen from that day forth ask him
[2:13:48] what any more questions so to finish
[2:13:50] your question question you need to
[2:13:53] understand
[2:13:54] Jehovah you need to understand how can a
[2:13:57] man BN of a woman a man that had a
[2:14:01] beginning can be
[2:14:04] God are you with me are you with me amen
[2:14:08] the Bible says in the Book of John
[2:14:10] Chapter 5 Verse 18 therefore the Jews
[2:14:13] sought to what the more to kill him
[2:14:16] because he's not only have done what
[2:14:18] broken the Sabbath but he says that God
[2:14:21] was what his
[2:14:24] father what does he mean making himself
[2:14:27] how equal with God so a Son of God means
[2:14:34] god a Son of God Is Not What me and you
[2:14:38] talking a son of man brother Benjamin is
[2:14:42] a son of brother Mickey but in
[2:14:47] deity when you are son you are like the
[2:14:50] one that created
[2:14:52] [Applause]
[2:14:56] you I don't know if you're getting that
[2:14:59] I don't know if you can listen to this
[2:15:02] my friend in Hebrew 1 verse 5 the Bible
[2:15:05] say For unto which of the angel said
[2:15:08] here what at any time thou are what my
[2:15:11] son in other words Paul is saying when
[2:15:14] God was talking to the angel did you
[2:15:16] ever seen him looking at the angel and
[2:15:19] calling an angel you are
[2:15:23] son amen amen so an angel is never a son
[2:15:29] he's a
[2:15:30] being amen he said he never called any
[2:15:34] angel you are my son amen D my son this
[2:15:40] day I have what I begotten thee so even
[2:15:42] though God created angel God never call
[2:15:48] never told the angel I have give birth
[2:15:50] to you
[2:15:55] because Angel are servant but to the son
[2:15:59] the son comes from
[2:16:01] [Applause]
[2:16:03] within in other words before a son
[2:16:06] become a son he was in the
[2:16:10] father so the son is only an extension
[2:16:13] of the
[2:16:14] father and whatever happened to the
[2:16:17] father is by default given to to the
[2:16:21] child that's why when Abraham PID
[2:16:26] that L who was in the loans of Abraham
[2:16:30] already paid T whatever happened to
[2:16:33] Jesus Christ you are already by default
[2:16:37] beneficiary of that that's why you
[2:16:41] cannot go to hell because Christ already
[2:16:45] went to hell
[2:16:51] do you follow me do you follow me
[2:16:54] whatever he did it's already put it unto
[2:16:56] you it is imputed to
[2:16:59] [Applause]
[2:17:01] you you don't have to cry you don't have

[2:29:41] it goes Lord deeper in the heart of your
[2:29:43] children may Lord father you use it like
[2:29:46] the stone of David to bring down any
[2:29:49] Goliath
[2:29:50] that has been standing in the life of
[2:29:52] your children that they can be free and
