to give an opportunity for um for for some praise offerings amen some praise reports we can't get we got kind of lengthy last week with our testimonies we're going to try not to do that because we want to reserve plenty of time for our pastor so if anybody has a praise report that they want to give this morning yes sir my wife got a text from sister tracy holloway brother mike what was his heart function is back to normal still talking about possibly you know doing surgery but she said they're claiming his total healing and we're going to stand with him that's wonderful did everybody

keeping my computer for him god bless you hey man it's our brother polycarp i was exalting what we saw last wednesday here to explain that when we come to church we really don't understand how god save us from a lot of things if god would open up our eyes to all the dangers we would always be fearful and afraid appreciable explique after i exhorted the family i was actually heating up some teeth for the children after that the flame came out and everybody saw the flame and god helped us we extinguished the fire and at that particular moment everybody was scared of and thereby god brought present tense what i was preaching about that danger is always around us and god showed us exactly what i was saying amen praise god [Applause] amen before i pray i would like to say testimony also sorry if i'm taking your time uh last sat yesterday uh over the weekend we went to visit a family relative in virginia farmville virginia and it was around i'll say two in the morning uh we got

amen praise the lord i'm gonna call um sister joanna and cousin jerusha to sing and then brother abel has one and we'll watch our time brother enoch has one as well but we're gonna watch our time um did you all want to do your announcement before they sing okay come on up come on up brother i'm robert and then we will um turn all these fabulous singers loose for the glory of god amen good morning everyone thank god too another wonderful day and for bringing us here together and always thank him for this place he has provided for us um this is uh there's two things we want to just bring to you your attention of course we have uh sister jeans funeral memorial service on next sunday evening between four and nine pm um this will be held in charlotte we'll put the address on the church chat as well but the time is very strict because we had to have a contract on the use of the building between four and nine pm so you want to be on time um we'll need everyone who can come to bring drinks because the church will be providing the meal um we also need help with serving the person who is doing the the catering will need help with serving and will need help to break down and clean up at the end of the the meeting um so just briefly i'd like to be open to get volunteers but just briefly those of us who are here now do we have like by a show of hands anybody here who knows they will be willing to serve next sunday evening can you show your hands um sunday the 17th yes so let me see your hands please one two three four five six seven eight nine 10 11 12. great okay so we have please give your names to the deacons at the end of the service oh i think it's 13. and um who will be able to help clean up after the meeting show of hands praise god thank you so much so that takes care of sister jane's memorial service wanna of course keep it in prayer that everything will be handled in order and um to be a blessing keeping the family in prayer constantly um the other thing we want to bring to the church this is dumb from our last deacons meeting we thought we would just bring a reminder of church order with regards to testimonies in the song series now we want every testimony because we know the believers overcome by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony amen so we're not the holy spirit is not trying to we'll never quench testimonies but we thank god for the messenger he has given us and putting things in order is a beautiful thing if we have nothing to put in order we need help but we have something so if you can put it in order it all comes it all works much better so i just want to read like three places here from the church order message prophet was saying he said in answering questions this will be in your conduct order and doctrine book as well he said then you know people will get up and say well i tell you let's have a good testimony meeting see i don't mean any critics on this i just mean to tell you the truth i mean to tell you the truth see i found testimony meetings of they do more harm sometimes than good see they really do now if somebody would have a red-hot testimony in time of a revival you know you're having a revival on you know a meeting and somebody got saved and just wanted to say a word well bless god let him unload his soul and see if he if he wants to to do that see just in the time of our revival i just want to say thank god for what he has done for me he saved me last week and my hearts are burning up with the glory of god thanks be to god set down amen that's fine go on that's all right but when you say now we come on who's next who's next now let's let's hear a word let's hear a word a testimony now if we got a meeting set aside a certain night for that see you're going to tonight next wednesday night instead of praying meeting it's going to be a testimony meeting we want everybody to come in and it's going to be a testimonial meeting and then when they come to to the place to give testimonies read the word have prayed and then say now we have announced this it's a testimony night so let's testify for that hour and 45 minutes or 30 minutes whatever it is and then go ahead see what i mean and i think it will help your congregation it will help everything all together amen amen that is good word amen the holy spirit likes to put things in order um and then the guideline the prophet gave about testimonies and even to praying we want to like watch our going into details sometimes it could take away from the testimony um and don't let this be cold water let us be refreshing amen in paragraph 167 167. so he said now many times that we ruin our service by a dragged out testimony meetings which i know i'm guilty of doing it and you get out when we used to have a street meeting and then we have some old brother stand up there and he'll stand out and ask him to offer word of prayer and he pray for the mayor of the city for the governor of the state for the president of the union and everybody like that and all the pastors are wrong you know everyone by number and sister jones in the hospital and things like that and people standing walking by on the street meeting just just keep walking you see he just wore them out well see the main thing we want and then he goes into the prayer um but we just wanted to be guided by this amen praise god god bless you as you all make your way up we appreciate our deacons for helping us come in order right we need to be in order and if i mean that's me too amen how many y'all need three [Music] um [Music] god bless you saints this song is singing about the goodness of the lord and um sister of course she was sharing her testimony with me this past week and i just was so blessed by it and tomorrow is her birthday i just wanted to sing this song to the lord and for healing her and bring her through [Music] i love you lord for your mercy never fails me and all my days i've been held in your hands from the moment that i wake up until i lay my head oh i will sing of the goodness of god cause all my life you have been faithful [Music] and all my life you have been so [Music] good [Music] of the goodness of god i

if you one of our family members which we believe you are god richly bless you amen everybody got brother up that's pretty good right we love testimony just make sure you go straight to the point amen then we get it praise be to the name of the lord let's go to the book of proverbs how many are up to date with the sermon how many can i see your hands okay praise be to the name of the lord so nobody nobody's lagging behind we must fight be brave okay we don't want to lag behind amen yeah i wanted to move with the lake of fire but the big boss is directing the gps and since i am only a shepherd under the great shepherd i have to submit to what he wanted amen so just hold on to the lake of fire we're going to get there but we have built up so much that you can see clearly now what the lake of fire is you can understand the second death pretty good so by the time we get to the book of esther you're going to see the second dead finest moving clearly amen proverb chapter 18. if it's giving you headache i got a bazooka here proverbs 18 verse 21 very very familiar scripture i labor on this i believe years ago in the old church so those that are i can remember you will remember those proverbs 18 verse 21 the bible says death we talk about the first death the second death the bible is talking about death and what already and life are in the water of water i thought they were under the power of god you heard it right you heard it right you heard it right you may be seated give me time and let me unload the cargo we only have one service if you complain in this church i need to sit down with you amen because we don't have sunday school yet no sunday night only one service so you chew you go chew your natural food if you complain see me amen two services a week pretty loaded death and life are in the power of the water whose tongue is it god's tongue the devil's tongue so who do you blame are you going to blame god do you blame the devil so who are you going to blame so if something happened again you know who to blame right right okay death and life are in the power of the tongue your tongue amen and they delove it love what they they love it how many hate their tongue it's a part of your body we love the tongue because we can tell them our peace of mind we love the tongue because i'm gonna make sure he understand me i don't like people to play with me like this so i'm gonna tell him and the only member i can use to really get my mind out is the water because when i do this they don't get it i'm going to cut him to pieces do you have a sword what is the sword you're using we can close here and go home i'm just relaxing you so amen the bible is beautiful you just read it like this and you sit down you say oh my god i was reading this all the time i never seen this the death and life are in the power of the tongue your tongue not the devil's stone not god's tongue your own tongue and they that love it those that really really love shall eat the water so you really like it if you give it out you're gonna eat it amen you're gonna suffer it if what you put up is sweet you're gonna get sweet if what you put up is bitter how can you send the bitterness and you wait for sweetness and you are even surprised ah which i didn't know they're gonna behave like this what did you shoot [Laughter] let's go to luke chapter 16. that's what your boss wants me to talk about i am not talking i am just texting it just dropped i didn't say anything i just text him it's an electronic tongue it's an electronic tongue and it created as much damage as the tongue you use what did you text [Music] that caused fire i didn't say anything luke chapter 16 verse 22. we're laboring here once we move out of here then we get to the lake of fire then we pull up to the resurrection amen wow the ship were going this way i tried to pull it up the boss is sinking it's like in the referendum brother kelly i tried to go to red for them he pulled me to the black dog i just surrendered he turned the sheep wow amen 22 and he came to pass that the beggar died you know the story now clear now and he was and was carried by the angels into abraham's bosom you know what he means now paradise amen the rich man also died and was water the body were buried all of them stay in the earth because they came out of the earth the 16th element of the earth did the body so when you die the earth say give me what belongs to me and they keep it here then whatever goes there handle it amen verse 23 and in what in heaven so in hell not here in the sermon and in hell he lift up his eyes being in torment now you understand the hell is not burning like i wish it hurt him it's a different kind of fire when you get to the lake of fire you will understand that fire being in torment and sees abraham a pharaoh so abraham was not close abraham was somewhere there and he sees abraham and lazarus in his bosom and he cried the reason why he cried because abraham is far right and he cried and said father abraham so this is not a hidden that's a jew because the jews were claiming abraham to be their father he said father abraham naturally he can claim that spiritually it's a different story what he was claiming abraham for was in the tomb the body through the body that's abraham but through the gene he was not abraham because not all israelis you remember okay now abraham father abraham have water he's this man is in hell and in hell he's seeking for mercy to have mercy you must be a vessel of mercy you remember that to begin with and there should be a certain place where you get mercy not in hell but how does he interpret mercy in hell amen he said have mercy on me what kind of mercy do you need from abraham in hell what is mercy in hell what is the definition of mercy in hell come on and sandhu said lazarus that he may dip the tip of his finger not even a glass but just the tip you know what a tip is right just a little bit like this the tip of his finger in water and cool my so mercy for him in hell is to get water father abraham if you want to show me mercy this is what i interpret mercy in hell mercy in here i need water if you can send lazarus to get me water not a glass of water just in the tip it's it's it won't be interpreted to me as mercy let me read it again at the opening of the seven seal [Laughter] the bible become anew have mercy on me and send lazarus that he may dip the tip of his finger in water in water and drink do what do you have your bible everybody got a rubber and do water so the water he's looking is not even for drinking it is a water not to drink anymore because he passed the time of drinking we okay now it's the time only to cool water to cool to cold water why he didn't want to cool his head why he didn't want to call his body what is in the tongue that is most important than the head what is in the tongue that is most important than your hand what is in the tongue that is most important than the entire body his whole body was in torment his all spirit into man and the only member that he can remember is only the tongue whether it's a natural or your electronic tongue you're going to remember it in hell [Music] keep talking keep proving keep showing people who you are keep bragging you're going to brag in hell amen to cool my tongue for i am tormented in this flame i'm not burning everybody clear tormented it needs for but abraham said son remember that you in your lifetime receive your good things and likewise lazarus evil things in other words everybody got their portion but now in this circumstance he is comforted so in paradise you get comfort and you are tormented in hell there is no comfort it's torment and beside all this between us and you there is a great goal fixed it's an extension so that death which will pass from here to you cannot neither can they pass to us that would come from there in other words the mercy you're looking for in hell doesn't exist why because there is no communication that's why you far over there and if you look between us and you there is a line a separating line there is a gulf i cannot come there you cannot come here in other words hell have no mercy everybody clear let's go to first peter chapter 3 that we're going to pray hallelujah i wish the whole church was here and if you're not here and you are online or you're going to follow this letter take your time sit home and go over this because i want those that are believers in this church to be good examples okay if you pray in this church i want you to be a good example in word in your action in your reaction and work in school on the street on walmart lets people see that light let people see this gospel let people see the mysteries that are coming

do is the lord shut your mouth up the lord will rebuke you if you grow up a little bit more in spirituality and if the lamb gets you pretty good you say forgive him because he doesn't know what he's doing let's go back to first peter why the tongue in hell why the tongue in hell hallelujah god also have the tongue they even took a picture and saw his tongue you need a coat to see me amen all right verse 9 not rendering evil what i'm saying here i wish you can go back again and listen to this over again that's the behavior in this church not rendering evil for evil or rolling for railing but contraries doing water knowing that you are there unto water so you are called to do what what is your calling to do what blessing amen that you should inherit the water call for blessing to bless to inherit blessing so you are blessed verse 10 for he that will love water how many want to leave let me see your hand anybody want to leave some people want to die who want to leave so the whole church want to live so if you love life for he that will love life come on and see water how many want to see good days how many want to see good days you want to see good deals in your life and see good days everybody clear let him can you read your scripture let him do what refrain water did they say refrain his eyes let him refrain water why the tongue in hell [Music] so the tongue hold the key to a good life the key to good days the key to blessings the tongue you want a good days you want a good marriage you want a good job you want a happy life learn how to [Music] it's control to be even quiet he that will love life and see good days let him refrain his tongue from water and his water that they speak no water let's pray heavenly father lord we thank you again for your grace for your love your mercy and for everything you are doing for us father if we stuck in our intellect we can miss your message and don't even understand that there is no rebuke it is just a love and sometimes it appear in the form of a rebuke if your children can only understand that no one is rebuked it is the love of the father telling them this morning that look at this area i want you to watch this area and i want you to correct this area because most of your trouble are coming from this area if they can only understand that that way and take me off the scene father granted unto them the blessing that is connected to that obedience lord be the alpha and the omega of this service father speak to us may you seal the devil completely out and may you be the only one that is going to be ministering to your children i rebuke every demonic spirit that is trying to bother the mind of the people even those that are going to listen to this sermon later on father may you protect their mind may they be able to discern and catch the man of christ and understand that the judge who come is not coming to judge them but he want to judge the sin that have been bordering them for years father are committed unto the hand in the name of jesus christ amen amen you already been seated we are dealing with the second banquet of esther we on part 14 we still under the second death because to understand the second death you must understand the lake of fire and go to hell and understand hell and the best way to understand here you have to go through the lake of fire everybody clear my subject today is the tongue and hell because we see this morning the young rich ruler is in hell but he also unfolded to us something in hell which is the tongue we know now when you die when you go if you're sinner or if you're a scent we understand that part we understand where the body goes we understand where the spirit and the soul goes we understand all this part that hell is not burning but hair is a torment place it's the chance of darkness it's the chance of circumstances it's a dimension that you are caught between the earth and between heaven everybody clear so far now as we begin to go we are again back again in this story of the rich young ruler hey barclay brother robert pointed this to me that when you pull this picture that you see here the hoffman head of christ here this picture is just a snapshot of this picture right here anybody clear so the whole plain view of this photo this picture is right there so it's really was painted as jesus christ and the rich young ruler amen so what they did they just cut the head of christ and pull it up and that's what you have but if you pull the whole picture the panoramic view it belongs to the rich young ruler and for some reason this painter by the name of offman painted the rich young ruler he didn't paint moses he didn't parent abraham the inspiration struck this man only to paint the witch young ruler and the amazing part on this picture we know that the rich young ruler went to hell and in hell there was no mercy anybody clear so far when you look at the head of christ you will notice that the direction he's looking at the rich young ruler is to the left [Music] are you awake are you awake are you awake because remember in the judgment of the white throne some people will be on the right side and other people will be on the left side and those on the right side will be as lamb and those on the left side will be as good and when he was talking to the young witch ruler it seems like his head was turned to the left side ever here but in this end time when he came down hallelujah his head was looking to the right [Applause] hallelujah so the coming of the crowd is not to go after the seed of satan but god is looking for the predestinated seed that was predestinated before the foundation of the world hallelujah brother branham said that when he came down he was looking to the right at the direction of the fifth that was safe at the cross in other words god is coming and he's seeking his seed god is seeking his children god is coming to take you he's not dealing with the other seed anymore but he's dealing with his own blood the bride of the lord jesus christ we just sons and daughters of god that were predestinated before the foundation of the world everybody here so far blessed be the name of the lord hallelujah let's give the lord a club this morning [Applause] hallelujah everybody cleared so far yeah we just left the airport we just left the airport now we're going up so keep your seatbelt because the airplane is like this everybody clear so let's climb a little bit blessed be the name of the lord we found out since we started that according to luke chapter 12 that the bible says that be not afraid of them that killed the body and after have no more they can do but be afraid of whom who after he has killed has power to cast in water depending if you lost you automatically go to hell but if you are safe like our sister gene today she's in the presence of the lord everybody so far in matthew 10 verse 28 and fear not them which killed the body but are not able to kill the soul but rather feel him which is able to destroy both the water the soul and the body in water you know what the hell mean already everybody clear so far as we continue to climb we found out that brother branham said don't let that be to us this is our visitation time that's why the cloud came looking at the right it is the time of our visitation god came down to visit me like he came to visit abraham hallelujah he came one time in genesis 18 to pay a visit to abraham hallelujah and in genesis 18 he never used the body of jesus christ he borrowed a different body to pay a visit to abraham and as he was in the day of lord so was it in the end time when god came to abraham he gave sarah the back [Music] hallelujah hallelujah that's why when god came in this end time he also stood and borrowed a body and that's why brother branham said i lose myself i am out he is in and brother branham can turn and begin to do the discernment telling you the seed of abraham i have come to visit you i have come to talk to you i have come to bring a body change [Applause] this message is yummy [Applause] blessed be the name of the lord this is our visitation time let's remember who that he is the water the same yesterday today and what hebrew 13 8 don't wait till some region yonder in the damn in that dimension where you cannot go in the presence of god and your time is up on earth in the nightmare of oral horror you shall remember you had your your opportunity and turn it away like the rich young ruler let the young people take notice to this let's all take notice to it because this is our visitation everybody here then when we enter hell we found out that jesus unfolded to us that's not only is he torment in hell but hell also got warm you remember last sunday all right if the hand offended cut it off it is better for thee to enter into life maimed than having two hands to go to hell into the fire we know that fire torment that never shall be quenched where the worm your own worm dies not and the fire is not quenched and we found out last sunday that's the only way you can block the worm you must be taken and put in the presence of the king when you are entered in the holy of the holy spunk and never brought worm those worm was forever sealed and never to be activated [Laughter] hallelujah now brother branham said the judgment is not now it's in the white throne and there is no burning hell now now the scripture now clearly stated that in her inhale the fire or the flame are tormenting they are not burning everybody clear and somebody tell you the guy is in burning hell now that is wrong but bottom is correct a judge of this earth is just enough to never condemn a man until he's brought to trial and god will never throw a man in the fiery furnace which is the lake of fire until first he is condemned by god's own law he rejected water there's no mercy in here so you see he first have to have a trial and the trial is the great white throne judgment but now he's in the place called a prison water so hair is a prison that you are placed temporarily in torment everybody clear until the judgment before you go into the lake of fire everybody clear now we found in hell here that the rich young ruler is talking about the tongue what is really going on with the tongue in here everybody clear usually there is three ways the bible explains this sometimes the scripture called math everybody sometimes the scriptures say tongue sometimes the scriptures say lips all three are speaking about the same thing everybody clear hallelujah in the book of luke chapter one when the angel gabriel came to zechariah the angel came and spoke to zechariah and said you're gonna have a child and zechariah and elizabeth were old and zechariah began to doubt the angel's message and when zechariah began to doubt something happened and the angel told him or brought a judgment on him the bible said and behold that shall be what let's look at the word dumb in the scripture hallelujah and behold that shall be done definition from the scripture from the message from the scripture from the message the the word interpreting the word [Music] and behold that shall be dumb and not be able to do whatever so a dumb man doesn't speak if you don't speak what is it block your tongue your mouth your lip let's continue until the day that these things shall be performed because that belief is not my word which shall be fulfilled in this season a message right there you drop down to verse 63 when john the baptist was born they came and they asked what is the name of the boy remember zechariah was not speaking at all amen and elizabeth when he was talking to zachariah zechariah was a zekra that's the way he was talking anybody here for a long time through the whole pregnancy are you okay mm-hmm we're going to church what do you do [Music] that's it so the child is born they say who is what is the name of the child elizabeth say his name is what let me ask a question where did that name come from [Music] because that name was given to zechariah by the angel elizabeth was not there are we okay one elite when zechariah left his mouth was how did he communicate with elizabeth the name [Music] you can talk you don't know how to communicate with your wife [Music] a dumb man knows how to communicate with his wife until his wife understands that the name of the child is john [Music] she doesn't understand me she doesn't understand me how are you communicating when you have a tongue let me stay on the highway [Laughter] are you there are you there are you there to show you a perfect marriage when the husband is weak they know how to communicate the sickness of the husband the condition of the husband never broke the intimacy he was not a hindrance to their marital life they managed to find a way to communicate under the circumstances hallelujah so one they brought the child say john they said we never heard such a name in our family ask daddy daddy you're the head tell us what is the name they're asking a dumb man what does he do what can he do [Music] he says oh he looks like he needs something to write and he asked for a writing table and wrote saying his name is who perfectly with his wife so when you go to the wife you ask john you go to the husband john you cannot get between that marriage same language not the wife doing this and the husband doing this hallelujah and they marvel all now they got a confirmation and his water so damn affect the mouth here his mouth was open immediately and his water was water and he did water so to speak you need all these three here [Music] close your mouth and try to speak with your tongue go ahead try right now close your lips and try to speak with your tongue i can't get it so your mouth needs to operate and your lips need to operate and your tongue to operate then you produce speech i leave the other part because your teeth need to be involved too and his back and praise god so when we talk about the tongue we're referring to not only the tongue itself but we're looking at the mouth the lips and the tongue together everybody clear so far now in the natural the bible say in isaiah when the poor and me the sick water and there is none and their tongue fell for what i the lord will heal them and i i the god of israel will not forsake them so naturally speaking here we found out that when somebody's tested thirsty for water he affects their tongue anybody okay so far now the problem is the rich young ruler is not on the earth everybody here his body stay on the earth that's where he was back buried on the earth what one to have is his spirit and his water can a spirit drink water can a soul drink water what kind of water was he looking for [Music] we okay continue to keep your seat belt everybody here in luke chapter 24 verse 36 the bible said and as they got speak jesus himself stood in the midst of him and said unto them peace be unto you but robert jumped to the inland but they were terrified and a frightened and supposed that they have seen a water they have seen a spirit what is the characteristic of a spirit ever here and he said unto them why are you troubled and why do thoughts arise in your heart behold my hand and my feet that is i myself handle me and see for a while has water and water so if you see a spooky spirit you hit him he has flesh and bone it's not a spirit by the word no bones no flesh so in hell no born no flesh when you have born and flesh what does he do to you for a spirit has no flesh and bone as he must have you may see me have and when he that spoken he showed them his hand and his feet why his hand and his feet because they were they were scars so spirits do have scar and while they yet believe not for joy and wonder he said unto them have ye here any water and they gave him a piece of water a broad fish and off a water and he took it and to prove to them that a spirit cannot eat the young rich ruler looking for water but what he is in here he is in here wrong theophany which is housing his spirit and his soul because when we die in our tabernacle dissolve here we get into another car and then you have to ride whether you're going to ride in heaven or you will be riding on the highway of hell everybody so water in the scripture have two meanings when we talk about god water sometimes speak of the spirit and water speak of the world everybody here i will pour out my spirit amen remember in referendum moses have to take the road and smart the rock and what and water came out of it ever clear or by the washing off the water by the world so inhale here what is it the spirit or is it the word everybody here so far blessed be the name of the lord brother of adam said there was a time that the people didn't go in the presence of god when they die they justify right that was in the water not now our sister straight in the presence of god amen so if somebody comes and tell you they seen her they see somebody else not here amen you can't see her the only way you can see her you must be there they went into a place called water paradise the bosom of abraham and there the souls of the just wedded in paradise but paradise was a place where god kept the souls like in the water because christians sleep every year that's why when they wake up at the resurrection they are waking up like out of sleep like oh and if you tell her sister gene you died so and so she said no i remember it was yesterday i just came up when she was going she enter into her into a stream and she goes back and she sits into a sweet dream your time doesn't affect her anymore [Applause] when she woke up at the resurrection it's like when you went to bed at 11 o'clock and you woke up at in the morning that's the way she's waking up she'll be like oh okay you say no you know he was in 2000 i just went to i remember when i went there hallelujah but paradise was a place where god kept the soul like in a dreamland until the water the blood of jesus christ was shed why for the blood of bulls and goats would not take away sin he only covered sin but jesus blood take away water what does he mean the blood of bulls and goats what does he mean hallelujah in john 7 verse 37 the bible said in the last day the great day of the feast jesus stood jesus living and christ saying if any man person let him come unto me and do what the only time you can drink you must be alive [Music] don't wait till you get to hell because in hell there is no more opportunity to drink everybody here he that believes on me as the scripture have said out of his water not this berry you know that belly right out of his belly shall flow water reverse your foot so if you receive jesus christ do you follow me do you follow me out of your heart you have rivers of water that's why he says where was lazarus getting the water they were in hell where was water [Music] it was dealing with the spirit and the soul your soul becomes a river of water temporary or permanently cooling your tongue [Music] are we okay is it too much can we continue to come keep your seat belt i'll tell you where to take it off are you there he that believes on me as the scripture has said out of his belly shall flow rivers of water but this speaking of the water which day that belief on him should water so water speaking of the water for there was not yet water so this water that he was looking for could not be this because christ was not dead yet he was in paradise are we okay now are we clear now so now he's left with one option which is the water for the holy ghost was not yet given because jesus was not yet water that's why when he was glorified he said now go wait in the upper room i am coming down bringing now though continue with your question about here matthew 19. let's zoom it up a little bit i'm going to let you take the seat belt sooner matthew 19 speak about the story of the rich young ruler are you okay you can unbuckle now we straight the young men say unto him all these things ever kept from my youth up what racker yet jesus told him you must do this you must do this you must do this he said i did all of them i am entirely eternal life i have a right to eternal life because i did all of this anybody clear jesus said unto him if there will be water was jesus dead yet how can you be perfect he's not dead yet we okay lord help your children if that will be perfect go and sell that dahes and give to the poor and that shall have treasure in heaven and come and follow me to opportunity the first you're gonna put up more money into your bank account over there in heaven and number two you're gonna follow me you have two opportunities i'm giving you the opportunity to invest in heaven and opportunity to invest on this earth and follow me if you take my word you're gonna be perfect i'm reading to you the scripture if you have a problem open your bible see if it's different about clear in john 6 and 6 63 the bible says it is the spirit that quickeneth the flesh prophet is nothing the words that i speak unto you they are water and they are water the boy was looking for eternal life and god gave him eternal life in the form of the word [Music] you follow me and that word for his life his personal revelation that could grant him eternal life for him not everybody was sell all that you have give it to the poor follow me if you just accept that word it's over for you you are perfect everybody he rejected that word anybody now in hell he's looking for that word to cold water are we okay are we okay take james chapter 3 my god okay we're good james chapter 3 hallelujah blessed be the name of the lord my people suffer for lack of knowledge we got to go slow until we sink and sink and sink and you're ready for the fight james chapter three if you dare you can say amen anybody clear i want everybody to have this you there everybody there if you're sleeping you can stand up you ready james chapter 3 verse 1 my brethren be not many water in other words teachers if you look at the translation you say teachers being on many teachers knowing that we shall receive the grater so now you understand why you need to pray for me [Music] right right all right verse two four in many things are we there we offend all follow me very carefully in plain language james is saying we are many we all make mistake in many things maybe somebody crossed you on the highway maybe a friend put you in school maybe a co-worker did this maybe your wife got you upset maybe you were waiting for a package from amazon it didn't come all of that it's a trouble and then you uh all of that you called the company i paid for this all of this we offend in many ways i don't know who did that that was your bonus are you there we offend in many ways all of us no exception everybody stop if any man offend not in what the same is a water so a perfect man brother robert is a man who does not offend by what anybody care about here are you following me it is a man when you check his mouth when you check his tongue when you check his lips he is strict [Music] are you following me are you following me am i reading a different bible let's go back again for in many ways many things we often know if any man offend not in the world the same is a perfect man and evil also to do what do you know what brother means to control to control the water are we okay so the full control are we following me that control your entire body is the tongue let me go back again why the rich young ruler was not worrying about the heat in the head the hit on the feet the hit on his arm why the heat of the tongue was the highest heat the control of the the whole body is wet everybody follow me everybody follow me i'm gonna drop something here brother branham says this how much faith can you use the trouble of it is today that i have found i said the other night two different classes of people one of them is a fundamental fundamentalist who is a fundamentalist i want you to stay awake i'm pleading with you are you there a a fundamentalist is who a fundamentalist positionally they know what they are and one who's fundamentalists know who they are are you there the next is the pentecost the fundamentalist and the pentecostal the pentecost don't have the faith the fundamentalists have the position truth so one have faith one knows the position but he doesn't have faith the other one have faith but he doesn't know who they are [Music] hallelujah they believe it now but the fundamentalist does not have any faith to operate what they believe they are they pentecostal has it but don't know who they are take your eyes off the denomination this happened in the message [Music] hallelujah it's just like a man who has a lot of money in the bank but he can't write a what that's the fundamentalist he's just bragging he's just bragging i have a lot of money i have a lot of money i have a lot of money i have a lot of money okay prove to us go ahead and buy a buy a car uh uh oh i don't know i need to talk to the banker to see how we can do i am proud i am proud we are the bride of jesus christ we are the bride of jesus christ prove me your brother [Music] [Applause] are you there are you there the second one is the other one can write a check but he ain't got water he always brag about power how the lord did this that i did this to me the lord did this the lord did this to me the lord the lord the lord i'm gonna pray i'm gonna pray i speak i'm gonna have bmw this this this this this no money credit low credit low that's why they have a tendency to go under depression because they brag too much and when they don't get what they were bragging they go like am i doing something wrong they told me to do this to do this to do this i did all of them i spoke in tongue i cried we cried we we i was rolling on the floor but i don't i can't get what i'm looking for before you know it you're going to go after people oh so i saw his power so i saw him power so and so her power so it's over oh over there they have power you go there over there they have power pentecostal don't know no money in their car in the message church the other one a lot of money don't know how to operate what he's talking about if i could ever get them together brother the millennium was started why this old nation will see something shaking like he never seen before sun and wonder will appear from everywhere if i could ever get fundamental faith and pentecostal people or pentecost of faith and fundamental water if you can bring those two together it's an explosion hallelujah i have often said i found two classes of people and being kind of a tutor as a baptist and make me just a little calvinist so they're not the extreme side but i said i found two type of people and one of them is pentecostal or full gospel it's called and the other is fundamentalist now the fundamental is positionally knows where he is placing christ jesus but he has not went it's more clarity now deep enough to have water he stopped at the intellectual knowledge never get deep enough so that intellectual knowledge become a reality with what we got and the pentecostal has went far enough to the born-again experience and the holy spirit but he is not fundamental enough to know his position he's shooting everywhere you demon of this you demon of this i catch you go back to the job places that's what pentecostal do you abandon you i bind you i release you to hell because he doesn't know who he is did you see jesus saying abandon devil abandon abandon and are taking you now now i'm carrying you now i'm throwing you to death did you see jesus doing that jesus knew who he was one word god [Music] you see what you have in the message i'm speaking this i'm speaking this i'm speaking this enthusiasm all the time before you know it depression church i'm helping you i'm taking all those further away check somebody who's sleeping beside you hallelujah i know who's sleeping i can see everybody are you there are you there blessed be the name of the lord brother branham continue he said but the only thing i have found as i travel i found two type of different type of people one of them is the fundamentalist the other is pentecostal the fundamentalist positionally knows their place in water by what why did we teach you origin why did we teach you origin in this church why did the holy ghost want you to know your origin so that you can be fundamentally anchor in the world [Applause] [Music] but they don't have too much water now a second step is often opening the pentecostal have a lot of faith but i don't know there what a promise in dealing with the pentecostal people if god willing when coming back i have found a weak spot of pentecostal people by god's help that is you are waters [Applause] i thought the pentecostal had faith so truly it is not faith the faith with scare is an intellectual faith you have the brain and you have the heart when they say somebody have faith and is scared faith is here and here it's fear all uncertainty and this is the one that drove the sheep so he can say i believe it brother i believe it brother i believe it but i believe it brother but that day did you hear what the doctor said so go ahead and go ahead and fill up the prescription first yeah i will be more sensible to that fill up the prescription then keep taking we know god will heal you hallelujah that's you are scared that's right that is true you are just scared to do it keep that in mind and you don't know who you are [Music] so knowing who you are help you understand your father [Music] and help you take your father at his word [Music] do you understand me because the tongue is the thing that controlled the body are you there oh my god go to james chapter three behold everybody we put water bits in the water why they didn't put bits in the horse chest why they didn't put bits in the horse leg the horse is powerful have you seen the horse it's like here if you got a stallion even to break a horse do you know what it takes when they get them from uh from uh from the wood or the forest or whatever before you can ride the horse they have to break that horse not that they're breaking their bond but they have to master go see when they're trying to master a horse sometime everybody care but somebody learns something he say if you wanna master that horse go to the mouth this powerful beast that is not scared of wall that you take him to all his coming even though there is a sword a spirit the horse is moving god jesus has a horse but that beast is control are we okay the horse by the mouth that they may do what so if you want a horse to obey you you need to control his mouth are you there hallelujah come on semicolom and we turn about the water so as long as soon as you take a control of the mouth are you there are you there you ride in your horse okay if you just hold the horse with the mouth do you follow me if you do this the horse does this if you just do this he's doing this in other words his gps is lost do you follow me he became slave becomes slave to you are you there if you do this he jumps are you there his brain don't work anymore your brain begin to make the horse use the power of the horse to do what you want the horse to do for you did you get something did you get something did you get something [Music] did you get something so

hallelujah hallelujah and you don't realize who you are if you only realize what position you are in heaven tonight there be something taking place here what are you talking about brother stephen hallelujah watch this in genesis 17. let me give you a background you need to stay awake in genesis 16 15 god called abraham and god was talking to abraham and god spoke to abraham abraham said god you gave me everything but i'm lacking in air are you going to take this heavy essay of damascus to be the one that's going to be there god look god said no not eliezer of damascus he said abraham come assad abraham came outside he said look at the star you remember we went to that when abraham looked at the star he said you see her the star that's how your seed will be so the promise of the seed of abraham was given in genesis 16 15. anybody follow me i'm saving time you can go review this at home in genesis 16 something happened the promise was taking longer sarah came the voice of sarah and say abraham this is taking too long i i don't know your interpretation but to me i don't know why you keep wasting your time don't you see something around you abraham say what i'm looking at my property he said i'm talking i'm talking about women open your eyes shine your eyes abraham say what he said you never noticed this young lady going around here abraham said yes she's your servant so what's wrong say she can have a baby maybe what god wanted to say you can have a baby from her and the bible said abraham listened to the voice of sarah and went to edgar and produced ishmael after god gave him the promise in genesis 15. everybody clear each my old bond begin to bring trouble to the home say i turn around he says abraham i can't stand this boy hell and her mother must go abraham one said no no no that's my own blood god said ah uh go ahead and take them out he took them out so abraham looked like he struggled from the promise of god in genesis 16. everybody clear so far now god comes in genesis 17. what is god talking to abraham first one and when abraham was what 90 years older nine the lord appeared to abraham and said unto him i am water abraham i am powerful why did god unfold to abraham i said almighty he was already 99 i am almighty walk before me and be there what check your bible a perfect man according to james is a man who know how to what brother his mouth are you there so god say abraham i gave you the promise before and then when you were waiting you messed up and now i am coming i want you now to go into a different level of experience with me the first time you heard the word but you also have a different voice behind my word you are me listening to two mixed words you are listening to my voice and the voice of other people and you produce ismail now i'm coming with a different level i am the one who caused the separation i am the one who took anger away from you i am the one who brought the separation so that i can bring you to a different level now the level i'm gonna bring you i want you to walk before me but one thing be perfect be perfect hallelujah i will make my covenant between me and me and i will multiply thee exceedingly and abraham fell on his face and god talked with him saying as for me behold my covenant is with thee and that shall be what are you there i told you you gonna have it you didn't listen you listened to sarah i'm coming back i am not changing my word i am standing on my word but i want you to move in a different level i cannot move with you with ishmael being there i'm

is still abraham let me tweak that one let me change your name and put h.a.m in the name [Music] i'm bringing you a h.a.m ministry amen because his name his name his name was abram [Music] are you there god added the hna are you there and put abraham are you there the letter air is the first letter the letter h is the x letter one and eight are both the same infinity or eternity god took a portion of eternity and inserted into abraham [Applause] [Music] do you follow me no abraham i want you to be perfect a perfect man is a man who knows how to do what [Music] and the promise they gave unto him he must be a father of what paul help me up here in the book of romans chapter 4 the bible says as it is written i have met dear father of water when was where was that scripture in the old testament genesis what does everything what 17. now paul tell me what happened to abraham because god told him to be perfect before brother of it he got it again before him whom he did what even who who does what come out abraham and call those what which be not as though the water so when god told abraham be perfect abraham changed his behavior did you follow me abraham begin to call things that are not existing as they are [Music] are you there so when you meet abraham you say how many children you have you say many nations [Applause] hallelujah hallelujah when abraham woke up in the morning he said sarah where are my children the people look and say do you have a children sarah oh i need to extend here we need a bigger property god says so [Applause] hallelujah he begin to call the faith that he doesn't see like they are [Applause] hallelujah if abraham needed a car abraham will wake up and say sarah i'm gonna have a car we need to start making a parking here sarah say you got paid you say no i'm gonna have a car are you there in other words all negativity was taken away from [Applause] abraham his mouth was always positive positive positive positive positive regardless of the circumstances hallelujah hallelujah he doesn't have a good job abraham do you have a good job he said yes you have a degree no hallelujah abraham stay before me and be water 18 who i guess what believe in water so abraham when god told him to be perfect his condition was very bad 99 years old go to the nursing home go see a 99 years old man are you there are you there that he might become the water of water according to that which was spoken so that seed shall be everybody here so shall that sit and bring water [Music] a new work a work of perfection in the old testament he could see the water his own body as water when he was about a hundred years old about 99 neither did yet the water [Music] he staggered nothing at the promise of god through water that was water doing water so when we hook up in the morning he said glory to god i have children glory to god i have children glory to god i have children this is the opportunity the young men missed and god is restoring that back again [Music] hallelujah giving glory to god do you remember john ryan you understand why the buddha told him hallelujah and being what fully persuaded that what he promised he was able to do what walk before me and be perfect his confession change abraham now knows how to control his mouth hallelujah oh my god hallelujah in the book of job chapter 1 the bible says there was a man in the land of ooze whose name was who and that man was what check your bible if you don't believe me you want to go home you want to go home you want to go home that man was who when abraham was did israel existed when job was did the nation of israel existed that's why he concluded everything in abraham so that the gentile because if he did it in israel the gentiles are locked because we were stranger to the common wealth of the jews go check galatian 3. are you there that man was how but according to james a perfect man is who a man who knows how to control water a perfect man an upright and one

see the end there the end is joy are you there i don't know who's clicking that okay he said you see the end there the end is joy jesus said okay so when i go through this the final product is joy the bible say for the joy that was set before him endure the cross so when he just saw the end the pain the whipping the spitting on him the taking clothes of him nothing compared to the joy not only that he said endure the cross comma despising the shame those people that are mocking you was no more in other words abraham beg received a vaccine against mockery against suffering it was nothing endure the cross despising the shame and he sat down at the right hand of throne of god in the power when he saw that power that position that's why when he rose again he say all power in heaven and earth is given unto me but when he was going through that trial the bible said he [Music] [Music] when he opened it forgive them they don't know what they're doing [Music] when he open it it is finished abraham seed of abraham walk before me and be heavenly father lord we are approaching you again humbly father this morning lord i ask you forgiveness for taking too long [Music] but father i'm just

same mistake and being subject to spirit without understanding this walk but lord your grace on your mercy is coming even when we think we don't deserve this even when we think maybe it's so and so against me father we don't understand that you're just working in our life in a mysterious way not as a lion but as a lamb father trying to bring us to that perfection where father we're gonna fully manifest today like your prophet said the millennium will start no wonder he could say that the seventh seal usher even into the millennium because what you're trying to do here and what you will accomplish because it's your word will lead us all the way to the millennium when we're going to be back again to eden to fulfill that one day that adam was not able to fulfill father you spoke in your word that it's not by might it is not by power but it's by the holy spirit father may you give people enough humility to humble themself to understand that there is no man in this church it is god only who's trying to do his will according to his own plan may father we submit ourselves to the word not only to be only hears of the word father but to be doers of this world so that when we leave out of this place we might be light to the people on the outside reflecting the very gospel that has been preached to us here father how can we meet somebody in the world and behave differently and maybe one day they can sneak out on our youtube channel and watch what has been preached here and wonder how can you be seated under a ministry such as this and you behaving like this how can you be sitting and all knowing all these things and continue to do this kind of things on whatsapp and facebook how can you be under such an anointed word of the hour sent by such a mighty powerful prophet and still living the kind of hypocritical life you live in father may you bring a conscience like you did to the prodigal son that your children can come to me to themselves and understand that they are children of god they are father seeds of abraham and you are calling them not to judge them but father to show them where they are their weakness their position their their place where they are now in their thermometer their temperature their spiritual temperature so that they can realize that they need you more than anything and further they need to move up higher to that high calling that you have called us lord father help this church lord give us the anointing and give us a special grace lord father to implement this word lord we commit everything unto the hand and the rest of the weak father may you continue to work and father consecrate our life only to you lord we humbly ask it in the name of jesus christ amen god bless you church we love you bye [Applause]
