Oh, what a great to do and they had and all the business maybe the president of the bank association all of them come and was Paul bearers for him and maybe the intellectual minister stood up and said our precious brother how many times has he wrote checks for the widows and how many times has he paid in our great organization and sponsored our program and maybe the businessman might have got a made a talk he got his reward that's right his investment paid off like that but from the world he was a great man but because he rejected the investment that Jesus gave him. The Bible said in hell &gt;&gt; he lifted up his eyes and he saw the man who had made the investment otherwise safely in the bosoms of Abraham comforted walking around fine and he cried. Now watch you say was he? Yeah. Father [Music] [Music] [Music] Create me a clean body. [Music] Oh God, and renew a bright spirit within me.

So welcome to spoken word tabernacle where the message of brother brandam is so much appreciated and it's yummy. Amen. I was going through this and if you look the way the Holy Spirit I believe I was working and then when I work I meditate and I'm working I'm meditating and I'm praying and suddenly he open up again and then when I look I say oh my god I never seen anybody who so zeroed in with the scripture like brother Brham &gt;&gt; in other words things brother Brham will say later on you look They're coming straight from the Bible clear. And it's it's impossible for a man &gt;&gt; to put things that way. &gt;&gt; It must be God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The message and the Bible are one. &gt;&gt; If God gave me time, we will go through the scripture and you will be amazed how things brother Brandham spoke here and how it looks like when they were writing the Bible, brother Brandham was sitting there. That's it. &gt;&gt; Don't worry my friend, I'm loaded. &gt;&gt; My microphone is loaded for 8 hours and 8 minutes &gt;&gt; and the material that is here can go beyond that. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; So say amen and we can move forward. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. I believe we are all up to date with the sermon. We are reading our Bible twice a day. our cood church ages 70 weeks of Daniel the seals adoption or somebody is listening to the message of the hour. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yesterday we had a wonderful young sisters meeting all the way to what 8:00 &gt;&gt; and was it 8:00 brother Glenn? &gt;&gt; 8:00 until there were no more question. &gt;&gt; So everything is clear. &gt;&gt; Is that right? &gt;&gt; And the quote you ask me I put the quote around 1:00 a.m. or something. You got the quote. We clear so far. They they even asked me to put some of the quotes right here so the whole world will know what is going on because it was about man not being romantic in the message. &gt;&gt; Let me leave it alone. When I thought about it, I realized all the quotes were given in the married couple meeting. &gt;&gt; So I say, you know what, every material is already loaded for you in a married couple meeting. So once you get into that material, you will retrieve everything. Brother Brandham spoke about bringing flowers. Brother Brandham spoke about buying a trinket. &gt;&gt; I have the code. Brother Brandham said whenever he travel he will get a little trinket for his wife. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham bought perfume for his wife. &gt;&gt; An expensive perfume. [Music] &gt;&gt; I can continue on and on and on and on. So every material everything all the detail the scripture they quote are in a married couple meeting. &gt;&gt; And I will encourage young men before you get married make sure you sit down. Young men, before you get married, &gt;&gt; make sure you sit down and listen to the married couple meeting so you know how to handle a sister in the message in a godly way and still be romantic like brother Brana. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. and &gt;&gt; and you who are streaming and looking at the sisters here. &gt;&gt; Ah you who are streaming and have an intent to come to this church to fish. Make sure before you get our sister from this church, sit down and listen to 20 hours of married couple meeting so we make sure our sister is taken care of well. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So young sister, tell your husband, &gt;&gt; your future husband, &gt;&gt; if he didn't go through the training here, tell him that you know what, get a weekend, come and sit down here. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; It's free without money, without price. &gt;&gt; Come and sit down. We will load you, put a big screen before you and tell you to go through this. It's I got scripture, &gt;&gt; I got quotes. What I gave you yesterday is just the surface. &gt;&gt; If you get into a married couple meeting, it will blow your mind up. &gt;&gt; That's the reason why I don't put them on YouTube. &gt;&gt; But I got a quote and I got a scripture for everything that I gave it to you. It's right there. Amen. &gt;&gt; So tell them to sit down and get some instruction to know what to do. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Brandham say you cannot get blood out of a turnip &gt;&gt; because there is no blood in turnip. &gt;&gt; So I don't want turnip to mary's young sisters here. &gt;&gt; Come and get the blood transfusion first and make sure you got the blood so you know how to give the blood. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. So no excuse for rough marriages &gt;&gt; because some are hiding under the name of culture. &gt;&gt; Our culture, our culture is the message of Yahweh. Let me start it again because now we getting warmed up pretty good. The culture of this church is not an African culture. It's not an American culture. It's not a European culture. The culture in this church is the message of the hour. Just like brother John say, the message brought us all together. So don't talk to me about your culture. Talk to me about the message of the hour. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Are we together? &gt;&gt; When you go to work, do you talk about your culture? &gt;&gt; And so when it come to the message now, you want to bring your culture. &gt;&gt; Keep your culture outside of this church. &gt;&gt; The only culture is the word of God. &gt;&gt; The message of the hour. If it's in the word, we stick with it. &gt;&gt; Amen. How can you live with a woman you don't compliment her &gt;&gt; and you think it's normal? It's abnormal. &gt;&gt; Brother, I'm saying never let that honeymoon seasonal. [Applause] &gt;&gt; I'm trying to control myself. Married couple married couple knows we went through this. You have forsaken your first love. &gt;&gt; Married couple remember that. And brother Brandham compared that love with a married man and a married woman. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Married people knows that. I gave the script. I gave the scripture and I gave the quote. &gt;&gt; You start marriage is good. Everything good on courtship you are good. And once you get into marriage suddenly everything died. &gt;&gt; So you were putting it off. &gt;&gt; You were putting it on. It was fake. You did it to catch the sister &gt;&gt; and the sister gave the heart that this is the sweetest man. I'm going to live with him the rest of my life. And when we get into the marriage, there is no more seed that you are sour &gt;&gt; like a lemon. &gt;&gt; Come and be under the sun, &gt;&gt; the rising of the sun. So it can mellow. It will it will it will it will work on you until you are wrapped. The best marriage in this message should be where &gt;&gt; in the message &gt;&gt; where &gt;&gt; in the message &gt;&gt; you don't have to envy no one outside [Applause] &gt;&gt; whatever is out there they copy the original from us. &gt;&gt; We were the one to have the original. Yes. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Those who compliment your wife are sisters, &gt;&gt; people outside &gt;&gt; and you yourself, you don't compliment your wife. &gt;&gt; In other way, you are blind. &gt;&gt; You don't see anything. &gt;&gt; Everything everybody seeing, you don't see anything. &gt;&gt; No, we need to recalibrate your mind. Come and get some ice &gt;&gt; so you can see the beauty in your wife. &gt;&gt; Not in another woman. In your wife. &gt;&gt; Not in somebody else wife. In your wife. &gt;&gt; Everything you need for a woman should be in your wife. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh. [Laughter] Yes, my brother. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, young brother, whoever is thinking to come down here, make sure &gt;&gt; sit down here. I don't know if you got the material. I got it for free here. Come here. Sit down. We will give it to you for free &gt;&gt; and make sure you have a wonderful marriage. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I told them yesterday I said what I want is for your marriage to be the best &gt;&gt; better than even our marriage &gt;&gt; so we can have a sample we will show the people in the message the people of the world that this is what a message can produce &gt;&gt; this type of marriage &gt;&gt; a mar a marriage where there is no abuse &gt;&gt; no violence &gt;&gt; nothing else but love. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, young sister, we clear, right? &gt;&gt; If you have another subject, put it in. We sit down and we can talk again. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because not only did we go to question and answer, but I love the fellowship. It was very good to see them sitting, eating, and just fellowship with one another. A very good thing. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, if you get any subject, just go ahead. Don't say brother Steven, stop there. The pastor is always available. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm a servant to you. So if something is there, put it up. Let's sit with the pastor. Let's talk. &gt;&gt; Amen. We see the pastor on the pull pit and the pastor is gone. The pastor uh uh uh not that. Let's sit down. Let's talk. Let's fellowship. Tell me what is in your heart. Tell me what is in your mind. Let's go ahead and sit because you will never have that opportunity. Especially we were back home with big churches. You f five 7,000 people churches. When are you going to see the pastor? But the pastor is a shepherd. &gt;&gt; He should be there for you. &gt;&gt; So if you need it, please let us know. Amen. &gt;&gt; So Lord's willing, in October 11, question and answer. And then October the 25th, the part three of courtship for the young men, boys. I don't have any choice. I have to drill things in you. Amen. Because you the head of the family. So October the brother Glenn say that's right. I don't have any choice. Amen. I got to drill everything in you. &gt;&gt; Drill everything because you the head. &gt;&gt; We don't want an empty head. &gt;&gt; A prepare well done head &gt;&gt; that a woman can find rest &gt;&gt; like roof rest in the house in the house of your husband. &gt;&gt; Not find trouble, find peace, &gt;&gt; find rest. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And so that the flower can continue on and on and on and on. Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. Merit couple meeting on December the 13th and then the building you pray for us. By God's grace, the Abraham Lincoln already moved from the back toward the front. Amen. &gt;&gt; So we are praying. They were supposed to start uh work last week but they could not because of the rain. So it looks like there might be rain. So pray for the rain to stop. &gt;&gt; If you have a problem with praying for the rain to stop, I got a scripture and I got a quote. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Yeah. Brother Brandham was trying to have I'm in a meeting and he said, "Father, we need rain, but for right now, souls are more important than the rain. Would you stop the rain?" I got the quote. I already gave it to the deacon. Amen. So pray so God will stop the rain this week completely dry so the Abraham Lincoln can begin to do what is supposed to be doing and raise everything up and we move on. Amen. So pray that the miracle takes place because everything is coming straight and you will see some transformation going on outside. So pray so the rain can be out of the way by God's grace. Amen. We went through the deacon meeting on s on uh Friday and by God's grace what we came up with is prayer will be on Tuesday &gt;&gt; prayer on Tuesday at 7:00 &gt;&gt; 700 p.m. in the evening.

All right, let's start first with Tuesday. &gt;&gt; Tuesday at 7 o'clock. By 6:45 the zoom will be going on. &gt;&gt; We don't want to waste time with testimonies and this this this. I'm not saying waste time. There is a time for testimony. &gt;&gt; But that is the time for prayer. &gt;&gt; If we start testimonies and this and this and this, we will lose 30 minutes. &gt;&gt; Uh so keep the testimony for the church and everything else. We coming for prayer. &gt;&gt; So if we read the scripture, we read the I mean a scripture exhorting two minutes and then we start praying. In other words, we will give more time toward praying versus any talking or what's going on. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So Tuesday at 700 p.m. Every Tuesday at 700 p.m. 700 p.m. to 8:00 or 8:05 or 8:07 depending on when we start praying. If it took eight minute to read the the the prayer request, then automatically we have to go to 808 or 8:05 or depending on what's going on. But by 6:45, you can jump on. You will get the zoom coming up from the uh church group chat. Hop on. You can come later. You can come according to your time. If you come I mean at 7:20 that's your problem. There's no problem. I cannot push you because based on your schedule, but hop on and then we go ahead and move on. And by 5:00 p.m., Lord's willing on Tuesday. So, you have today up to Tuesday by 5:00 p. p.m. get all your request and send them to the song leaders. You can send them to brother John. You can send them to brother set. Send all this prayer request and everything there. So when it's 5:00, we're not going to sit there and begin to get unspoken or prayer request. We will lose time. So make sure put everything except if there is an extreme emergency that popped up. That makes sense. But let's try to minimize and organize everything. Send all your requests by five o'clock and then at 7 o'clock we read the scripture, speak like one minute and then jump into prayer and pray pray and let you pray for yourself and your family and we stop and then go and pray over all the requests and we keep on moving and if the Holy Spirit lead us, he will let us know whether we need one more hours or we need another day or something like that and we keep moving. Any question? Any question? Go ahead, my brother. &gt;&gt; The deacon are handling that. I don't want to say it right now. I'm on YouTube. The deacon are handling that. Amen. So, whoever can get in there, they will get a link. If I put it up right now, you will your my uh uh chat on YouTube will begin to be filled right now in in about five minutes. And by tomorrow I will have phone call coming up everywhere. So we put it up on the deacon. If you have any questions, send us an email. But if anybody need to receive something, the deacon are on board on that. Brother Robert already showed me this morning what he's working on. And so everything is covered. So if somebody needs something, they need to contact the deacon on contact me and get a permission then we go ahead and handle that. We don't have any problem with that. But we just want to do it in a orderly way versus if you open up then we don't know who's who and where it's coming from. So just to make sure we clear unless you have somebody in mind you see me or see the deacon and we go ahead. Everybody clear so far? &gt;&gt; We clear. &gt;&gt; Can you say amen my friend? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We clear. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This Tuesday 7:00. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If it goes well, if we need more, we can always open up more. So, we will see. I don't want to start with a big thing and then before you know it, we start doing them. Let's start with one hour and let's see how it's going and move on. So, at that point, you don't have to drive all the way here to church. You get there, you can close your screen, whatever you want to do, but let's go ahead and pray, pray, pray, pray. I gave you quote uh I mean uh I mean a clip about prayer. We already taught you about prayer in this church. You can go back on YouTube and see how to pray and you can review that all together. So when we get there, we start. Sorry. You don't have to be at home to be on that zoom. You can be at work. If there is a possibility for you to do it, you can do it. You can be on your car. You can put it on your truck or wherever you are. You can join in. It's just a Zoom link and you can go just the way you streaming everywhere you are. We can do the same thing. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We clear. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. So, let's go to the reading of the word. The flight attendant prepare for takeoff. It's amazing spoken word. &gt;&gt; Amazing. Glory to God. You will need your Bible today. I will try my best. I try to go this route to to clarify certain things because these things are very difficult and if the Lord don't help you, you will get lost in the scripture. But there is no contradiction in the scripture. And if you get online, you will see people that thought it's a contradiction. But it's not a contradiction. It's clear. So I'm going this route to just make things so simple for you. So one day if you go back to those chapter in the Bible and you read them, they will be easier for you to comprehend them because you will be seeing Hezekiah saying this and then Ezekiel is saying this, then Jeremiah is saying this. But if you don't understand the background, you might be missing certain things. So I'm trying to make things as simple as possible. So you need your Bible. Amen. Let's go ahead and pray. Heavenly Father, Lord, we are approaching you humbly this morning or this afternoon soon. Father, thanking you for your grace, your love, your mercy, and for everything you have been doing for us. Father, this is as far as I can go with the ability you have given me. But when it come to speaking to your bride and ministering to them, you only take the supernatural action of the Holy Spirit. Father, may you move me completely out of the way. And not only me, but the visible and the invisible audience completely out of the way. So you will be the one ministering, the one talking, the one hearing, the one interpreting, the one blessing, the one filling, the one delivering. And Father, may you come in the clarity of your word. And Lord, father be Lord declare in a mighty way in the midst of your children. Lord we rebuke everything that is contrary to your word any influence from the outside atmosphere into the church. But father may your freedom be in the midst of your children. May you anoint us Lord Father and speak to us so in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. My subject this morning, you can turn to the book of Psalm chapter 23. My subject is our life journey through Joseph's five garment part 80. &gt;&gt; You reach 80. Amen. And my theme, Lord's willing, is season. Seasons. I'm trying to push forward. I can't. I have to follow the spirit of the Lord. Season in the midst of chaos. A season &gt;&gt; in the midst of chaos. &gt;&gt; What look like a chaos, &gt;&gt; it's a season. &gt;&gt; Because if I go straight to the other way, you will miss this. And that's where the devil is has a PhD &gt;&gt; on making you miss a season because of trial. The devil has a PhD on that. He work on humanity and your great great great great even on everybody over there since uh Eden. He's very good at that. Amen. But the seals are open. &gt;&gt; And because the seals are open, there is no way the devil can take a preeminence on the children of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's go to Psalm 23. If you dare, you can say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. The Bible says that the Lord Elohim. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Lord is who? &gt;&gt; My shepherd. &gt;&gt; And because he's my shepherd, I shall not want. You might be seated. According to Jeremiah 10 verse 23, I'm warming the engine. The Bible says that, "Oh Lord, I know that the way of a man is not in himself." &gt;&gt; This is a Bible principle you have to understand. &gt;&gt; Your way is not up to you. &gt;&gt; Let me put it a certain way. Your life &gt;&gt; is not up to you. &gt;&gt; If you ever thought you got things in charge, you messed up somewhere. Amen. &gt;&gt; And every decision you would take will cause you problem. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; The Bible says that I know that the way of a man is not in himself. &gt;&gt; It is not in man that walketh to direct what? &gt;&gt; So you cannot lead yourself. No matter &gt;&gt; no matter how intelligent you are, &gt;&gt; no matter how smart you think you are, &gt;&gt; no matter how independent you think you are, &gt;&gt; the Bible say you cannot direct your step. &gt;&gt; That's why we need a shepherd. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about a pastor. I'm talking about the Lord himself is your shepherd. &gt;&gt; In other words, you were designed to be led. &gt;&gt; You were designed not to lead yourself. &gt;&gt; You might have ambition. You might have desire. &gt;&gt; But the ultimate decision of leadership cannot come from you. It have to come only from the Lord &gt;&gt; because God designed you to be led. &gt;&gt; You were not designed to lead yourself. &gt;&gt; You were not designed to be independent. &gt;&gt; You were designed to be dependent, &gt;&gt; dependent upon the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; That's why God called you lambs &gt;&gt; because he himself was a lamb. and he learned obedience &gt;&gt; as a lamb. He had to be submitted by the dove. &gt;&gt; And David is saying the Lord himself &gt;&gt; is my shepherd. In other words, my entire leadership is in the Lord. Yes sir. Yes sir. Nothing but &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we clear so far? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Lord verse one is who? My shepherd, &gt;&gt; my shepherd, and I shall not water. &gt;&gt; A shepherd is there to lead the sheep. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And a shepherd have a higher brain &gt;&gt; than the sheep. &gt;&gt; A shepherd have a higher mentality, &gt;&gt; a higher faculty than the sheep. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. And the purpose of a shepherd is to lead. &gt;&gt; Is to guide. &gt;&gt; Is to direct. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We clear, my friend. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A shepherd. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; He's there to lead. &gt;&gt; He's there as a guide. &gt;&gt; He's there to give instruction. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To lead you, to guide you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So you cannot be before the shepherd. &gt;&gt; No sir. &gt;&gt; No sir. &gt;&gt; You must be behind the shepherd. &gt;&gt; Because the shepherd knows the way. &gt;&gt; The shepherd knows the way. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Why? Because he is a guide. &gt;&gt; He knows the way. Amen. &gt;&gt; He's the one leading you. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. He's the one directing you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A season in the midst of what? &gt;&gt; Chaos. &gt;&gt; Let's watch the leadership of this shepherd. &gt;&gt; Verse two. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He makes me to lie down where? &gt;&gt; In green pastures. &gt;&gt; Everybody love this. &gt;&gt; Where is the shepherd taking you in green pasture? Amen. &gt;&gt; He's taking you to a banquet. &gt;&gt; He's taking you to a restaurant. &gt;&gt; We all love that. &gt;&gt; Green pasture. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Taking you to eat. &gt;&gt; You can refocus, sister. Amen. &gt;&gt; He makes me to lie down in what? &gt;&gt; Green pastures. &gt;&gt; He leads. You see the leadership, &gt;&gt; he leads me beside what? &gt;&gt; Still water. &gt;&gt; So the shepherd knows which water &gt;&gt; to lead you to &gt;&gt; the shepherd have an idea where the trouble water are &gt;&gt; and where the steel water are. &gt;&gt; You don't know where that water is. So you need to depend on the supreme intelligence &gt;&gt; of the shepherd because he knows the way. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You might see a water that looks still. &gt;&gt; Come on, brother. &gt;&gt; But there could be a crocodile there. &gt;&gt; So the shepherd knows the water and knows what is in the water. &gt;&gt; And he knows that the water is safe for the sheep. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. So this still look good. Where is the shepherd taking you to? He's taking you to green pasture. &gt;&gt; Oh, praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Green pasture. Praise the Lord. You got a good shepherd. &gt;&gt; Where does he take you? To green pasture. &gt;&gt; You got a good daddy. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Where does he take you to green pasture? &gt;&gt; Did he stop there? No. He takes you also to what type of water? &gt;&gt; Water. &gt;&gt; Trouble water. &gt;&gt; No sir. &gt;&gt; Oh. So it looks like the shepherd is avoiding danger &gt;&gt; at this point &gt;&gt; because he want you to go in a peaceful water. &gt;&gt; When you eat, you eat, you finish, he takes you to a sweet water. And you sit down, you say, "Thank you. This feels so good. It's so calm here. Everything is good. I love the strawberry lemonade. I It tastes so good and everything. Ah, praise the Lord. I just picked up strawberry lemonade. Okay. I love sweet tea. So, we balance it up. Amen. &gt;&gt; It is so good. It's so sweet. This is the best. Put a lemon on it. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? I'm moving the airplane. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Verse three. He does what? restoreth my soul. &gt;&gt; Oh, he refreshes your soul. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He restoth my soul. And he does what? &gt;&gt; He leadth me in the paths of righteousness. &gt;&gt; Does he lead you in the wrong way? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; In what path? &gt;&gt; Paths of righteousness. &gt;&gt; So this shepherd, it looks like everything, every leadership, every way the shepherd is leading us is good. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's leading us to paths plural of what? righteousness. &gt;&gt; So this leadership is in a good place. &gt;&gt; Still water, &gt;&gt; good path. Path of what? Righteousness. When you walk there, everything look nice, right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He leads me in the path of righteousness for what? &gt;&gt; His name sake. &gt;&gt; We went through that because of his what? Reputation. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then on verse four, David says something else. Because now we are more excited. What is the next one? &gt;&gt; In other words, we want to know David, who's your shepherd? The Lord. &gt;&gt; Talk to me about the Lord. &gt;&gt; Where does he take you? &gt;&gt; Then David say, you know what? He takes me to green pasture. He leads me beside. Say, oh, that's a very good shepherd. Ah, and what else? In the paths of righteousness. Oh my god. I I want to be part of your team. And David say, "Yay." &gt;&gt; Yay. What? &gt;&gt; Verse four, David say, "Yay, though I walk &gt;&gt; through the valley of the shadow of life." No. [Laughter] &gt;&gt; Who's who's walking through the valley? &gt;&gt; David. &gt;&gt; What type of valley? &gt;&gt; The shadow of what? &gt;&gt; How did David get there? &gt;&gt; Because Because it's not up to men &gt;&gt; to direct his step. &gt;&gt; Amen. and the footstep of a righteous man. &gt;&gt; I direct by who? &gt;&gt; So David, you told me the Lord take you to green pasture. &gt;&gt; You told me the Lord take you to uh still water. You say the Lord take you to a path of righteousness. And there are many paths of righteousness. So, how did you end up &gt;&gt; in the valley &gt;&gt; of the shadow &gt;&gt; of death? &gt;&gt; How did you end up under the pale horse? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Your answer first will be, you know what? That was yourself. You the one that did it. That's &gt;&gt; right. &gt;&gt; Because the Lord always take you to green pasture, still water and this this this. So this is not the leading of the Lord. &gt;&gt; This is you got yourself in trouble. &gt;&gt; But we need to find out who took David there. &gt;&gt; Because David is saying, I'm a sheep. &gt;&gt; This is what David is saying. I'm only following. &gt;&gt; When he goes, I realize where he took me is green pasture. &gt;&gt; The next step he took me was still water. &gt;&gt; The third step was the path of righteousness. But &gt;&gt; I also found out &gt;&gt; that I found myself somehow &gt;&gt; at this point walking through the valley &gt;&gt; of the shadow &gt;&gt; of death. Who took you there? &gt;&gt; That's it right there. &gt;&gt; Let's read. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let the Bible answer itself. &gt;&gt; Verse four. He said, "Yeah, though I did what? &gt;&gt; I walk through the valley of &gt;&gt; through the valley of the shadow of what? I do what? &gt;&gt; I will fear no evil. &gt;&gt; Oh, David. &gt;&gt; David is saying I'm walking in the wrong place. &gt;&gt; Death is around here. &gt;&gt; It's an anointing of death. &gt;&gt; That's why I say the pale horse is right here. &gt;&gt; I am under the anointing of the pale horse. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Because the pale horse is the anointing in &gt;&gt; Laia. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; But David say, "Even though I'm there, &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I'm not afraid." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because David supposed to scare you. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; But David say, "I am not afraid." &gt;&gt; Why David are you not afraid? Let's go read it, my friend. He says, "Though I walk in the valley of the shadow of water, &gt;&gt; I do what &gt;&gt; will fear no evil." &gt;&gt; Why? &gt;&gt; For thou art with me. &gt;&gt; So, who is with David there? &gt;&gt; God. &gt;&gt; But we know that David already told us he's not the shepherd. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. David say I am not the shepherd. &gt;&gt; The one who is the shepherd is who? &gt;&gt; I am a sheep. I'm only following him. &gt;&gt; But I found out myself in the valley of the shadow of death. &gt;&gt; But when I look around, I'm not myself. &gt;&gt; The shepherd is there. &gt;&gt; But we know that who is leading the road? &gt;&gt; It's the shepherd. &gt;&gt; It's not David. So, how did David get there? &gt;&gt; So, who led David there? &gt;&gt; I'm waiting for you to respond. Amen. &gt;&gt; Take your time. &gt;&gt; So the shepherd of David &gt;&gt; sometime may take you &gt;&gt; in a different zone. [Applause] doesn't take you always to green pasture, &gt;&gt; always to still water, &gt;&gt; always to the path of righteousness. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. He also take you to the valley &gt;&gt; of the shadow &gt;&gt; of death &gt;&gt; because David doesn't know the road. He's depending on the shepherd. &gt;&gt; But David found out that even though it's scary, &gt;&gt; that's not my problem. &gt;&gt; He is the one leading me. and he is the one with me. &gt;&gt; As long as he is with me, &gt;&gt; even though it's a rough road, &gt;&gt; I am not afraid. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; I'm trying to take off from the airport. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Because it's very easy to be on a green pasture &gt;&gt; and to drink a Coca-Cola. Very good. &gt;&gt; That's correct. But in the shadow of the valley, the valley of the shadow of death, you are always alert. &gt;&gt; But we found out that David instead of being alert, David is whistling. &gt;&gt; They say David, why are you whistling? &gt;&gt; When you are in the valley of the shadow of death, &gt;&gt; why are you whistling when you under dialysis? [Music] [Applause] Why are you whistling when the doctor say it's cancer? &gt;&gt; Why are you whistling when they say you are sick? &gt;&gt; When they say there is no remedy to your problem, &gt;&gt; but you are still fine. You are still confident. What makes you confident? [Applause] &gt;&gt; Because I know I didn't choose. Yes Lord. &gt;&gt; Let me ask you here. &gt;&gt; Who is here? Who is here will pick disease? &gt;&gt; Who is here will say no no I want to experience corona virus. &gt;&gt; We all run away from it. &gt;&gt; But somehow we found oursel there. &gt;&gt; You have you found yourself in the place you didn't want to go. &gt;&gt; So who took you there? [Applause] I'm not here to advertise the devil. &gt;&gt; I'm here to advertise God. [Music] &gt;&gt; In other words, I'm not going to say the devil got here. I say the Lord led me through here. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In green pasture, what do you do? Eat &gt;&gt; here. What do you do? Drink &gt;&gt; here. What do you do? Looking around. I'm on my way to rejoicing. No problem. Here you begin to know who is God. Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Let's go. Verse four again. Yeah. Though I do what? &gt;&gt; Help me move on with the scripture, my friend. &gt;&gt; Though I walk into the what? &gt;&gt; The valley. &gt;&gt; I already gave you a quote about 45 minutes. Yes. Through the weekend. Brother Brandham told brother Neville, you're just getting started. It was 45 minutes. And brother Brandham say, I don't know where you got that from. It's a shame. It's in the group chat. &gt;&gt; It's in the group chat. &gt;&gt; Ah, so leave me alone. Let's go, my friend. Please. Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of water &gt;&gt; because you got to know this type of stuff. There is one there by &gt;&gt; I will fear what &gt;&gt; no evil &gt;&gt; for thou are what &gt;&gt; with me. &gt;&gt; We need to know who is with him. It is God. What type of God? Look what he say. Thou what? &gt;&gt; And what? &gt;&gt; Thy staff. &gt;&gt; So what manifestation of God is there? &gt;&gt; A shepherd. &gt;&gt; The road and the staff belong to who? &gt;&gt; It's shepherd to. So the shepherd is the one that was leading David through the wrong valley. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; My friend is my Bible different than yours. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; David is saying I'm not afraid because your road and your what? &gt;&gt; Road and staff belongs to who? &gt;&gt; So who is in the valley of the shadow of death? &gt;&gt; And the shepherd is the one leading. So who took David through the road? Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; The road that you think is rough, &gt;&gt; who took you there? &gt;&gt; Did you pick it up? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said that road and what? &gt;&gt; Thy staff. &gt;&gt; The road is for defense, &gt;&gt; for protection. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the staff is for guidance. It's for support &gt;&gt; and it's also for rescue &gt;&gt; because sometime he have a a hook like this. &gt;&gt; So when you were about to fall down the shepherd just put a hook there. &gt;&gt; Are we together? And David said your tools are doing what? &gt;&gt; Comfort me. &gt;&gt; They are doing what? &gt;&gt; Comfort me. &gt;&gt; They are comforting me. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we clear so far? So we find out that the shepherd is leading David in a rough road. &gt;&gt; But because the shepherd is there, David instead of minding what is around, &gt;&gt; it &gt;&gt; are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; David is focusing on the shepherd and on the tools of the shepherd. As long as the shepherd is there with his two, I don't care what's going on. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, we left from a happy greenish &gt;&gt; uh babbling place. Now, we going to a spooky place. &gt;&gt; But let's see what spooky does. drop to verse uh five if you there you can say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He prepares a table [Music] &gt;&gt; where &gt;&gt; before me. &gt;&gt; Before me in the presence of the brother in the message &gt;&gt; in the presence of what? &gt;&gt; My enemies. &gt;&gt; When you were in the green pasture, did he prepare the place the table for you? Did he prepare the table for you over there? &gt;&gt; Only when your enemy are present. &gt;&gt; That's when he begin to prepare a table. In other words, the presence of adversity is important. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's a hard lesson. I told you it's a very hard lesson. &gt;&gt; He's preparing the table in the presence of what? How can you prepare a table when the enemy is looking at &gt;&gt; Do you think the enemy will clap hand? &gt;&gt; No, sir. &gt;&gt; The enemy will do what? &gt;&gt; Try to kill you. It will stir up even jealousy &gt;&gt; and God instead of sparing you &gt;&gt; avoiding to bless you in the presence of the enemy because it's going to cause you problem. God make sure he put a table and he wipe the table and he put a tablecloth and he call sister Pam and say go ahead and put some decoration and then God begin to pour the blessing when the enemy is seeing you. [Applause] So when you see the enemy coming, you need to know how to interpret that. &gt;&gt; The enemy is bringing a season. &gt;&gt; The presence of the enemy is a season. &gt;&gt; It's a preparation of a table. &gt;&gt; The table is only prepared in the presence of what? Ah please let's let's go together. Let's go together. The the he prepared a table where &gt;&gt; in the presence of what? &gt;&gt; So if the enemy is not there, are you going to get your table? &gt;&gt; No sir. &gt;&gt; So what do you need for your table to be prepared? &gt;&gt; Bring some Judas. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Is this is this difficult? A what &gt;&gt; season? In the midst of what? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In the midst of the enemy. &gt;&gt; That's when God say, you know what? It's time to put a table. &gt;&gt; Let's see what he does on that table. &gt;&gt; Is my Bible different than yours? in the presence &gt;&gt; of what? &gt;&gt; My enemies. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He He prepareth what? A table &gt;&gt; over here. You are eating yourself without a table. &gt;&gt; But when God begin to see the enemy, &gt;&gt; God put a banquet. Yes. Take your time right there, brother. That's it. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Verse six. You prepare a what? &gt;&gt; A table. &gt;&gt; A table in the before me in the presence of what? &gt;&gt; My enemies. &gt;&gt; And you do what? &gt;&gt; Anoint my head with oil. &gt;&gt; Why didn't he anoint you in the green pasture? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When you are in green pasture, there's no anointing. &gt;&gt; Is my Bible different? When you are in still water, there is no anointing. But when you begin to go through trouble, that's when the anointing come. What you are calling chaos is a blessing. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I don't know if we together. [Applause] &gt;&gt; When he was taking you in the path of righteousness, did you see the anointing? &gt;&gt; But when he sees the enemy, &gt;&gt; then God say, "Oh, enemy is there. &gt;&gt; Oh, okay. bring up a table &gt;&gt; and then he's anointing what? &gt;&gt; What is he putting on? &gt;&gt; Oil means what? [Applause] &gt;&gt; He's anointing my head. He's consecrating me. &gt;&gt; In other word, I'm blessing him, but I'm also anointing him. &gt;&gt; What do you need the anointing for? [Applause] [Music] I don't know if we together &gt;&gt; in the valley &gt;&gt; of the shadow &gt;&gt; of death. You are depending on his ro and on the staff. &gt;&gt; But when the enemy show up, &gt;&gt; God back up, he anoints you. &gt;&gt; In other words, you do the fighting. &gt;&gt; Maybe you do the fighting. All you need is an anointing. [Applause] &gt;&gt; When you going through problem, instead of looking at the problem, &gt;&gt; search the anointing. [Applause] [Applause] Because problem comes with anointing. [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; Are we together, &gt;&gt; my friend? I'm loaded. I don't know if I'm going to move. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; You must see a sister. &gt;&gt; A sister. a sister with uh babies maybe a baby or something and a sister is going if you tell her jump she won't jump &gt;&gt; she will be walk come here and you see her coming like this &gt;&gt; put fire in the house &gt;&gt; and the baby be there &gt;&gt; watch that same sister [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; you will be surprised how she's going to jump &gt;&gt; and get into the fire and pick up the baby and come out. What happened to the sister? &gt;&gt; The anointing. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; So in the presence of my enemy, what happened? &gt;&gt; And after table, what happened? &gt;&gt; Anointing. anointing. &gt;&gt; We need to know what level of anointing. [Applause] &gt;&gt; We've been reading this all the time. Let's see what because everybody of us &gt;&gt; have a measure. &gt;&gt; Some of us are 18 widers, &gt;&gt; some are sedan, some are V8. &gt;&gt; Everybody have their own anointing. If you don't have a uh if if if you have a difficulty understanding everybody have anointing. Let's go to the restaurant. &gt;&gt; If I take you to the restaurant, you will find out that we have different capacity. &gt;&gt; I may finish a big steak and some of you will require to go boxes because your your your measure is small. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Uh, &gt;&gt; are we together? &gt;&gt; You don't hear me? Okay. &gt;&gt; I'm good. &gt;&gt; It works for me. &gt;&gt; I'm good. &gt;&gt; Yes. I'm good. &gt;&gt; Praise God. So, let me keep it here for backup. If the deacon brought it, let me keep it here for backup. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Thank you, brother Robert. Okay. So, everybody has a measure. &gt;&gt; Are we together? And David also had a measure. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; And in other words, if your belly is 60 gallon, &gt;&gt; I'm just picking up like that. Okay. If your truck is 60 gallon, &gt;&gt; so it makes sense. If your truck is 60 gallon, Amen. When you get to the filling station, to the gas station, when you begin to pump gas, &gt;&gt; when you pump, you pump. You pump. When you reach 60, what happen? Yes sir. &gt;&gt; It stop because you cannot get anymore. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Just like you go to a restaurant, you eat, you eat. When you full, you fool. You can't get anymore. &gt;&gt; But let's see what type of anointing you get when your enemy see you. &gt;&gt; Can we read it? &gt;&gt; Can we read it? &gt;&gt; Verse five. You prepare what? A table before &gt;&gt; a table when &gt;&gt; before me &gt;&gt; where &gt;&gt; in the presence of my enemy. &gt;&gt; And you do what? &gt;&gt; Anoints my head with oil. &gt;&gt; And my cup do what? [Applause] &gt;&gt; When the enemy come, what happened to your cup? &gt;&gt; So God will anoint you more than you need. Are we together? &gt;&gt; What looks like a chaos, &gt;&gt; it's an opportunity for an an overflowing of anointing. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I don't know if we together. &gt;&gt; In other word, if your cup is like this, &gt;&gt; Yes. If your cup is like this, when God see the enemy, &gt;&gt; huh, God comes quickly and begin to go like this. &gt;&gt; Amen. And when he get here, the angel say, "Stop, stop." And God is just like this. He forgot to to read the [Applause] &gt;&gt; before you knowing the anointing is no more only feeling you. It is now all over me. It's all love for me. It's all love me. It move from the heart to the body to the spirit. And when it's overflowing, it will touch my neighbor. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Are we together? I'm already leaving the airport. Are we together? &gt;&gt; So, the presence of the enemy is a blessing. The more trial you going through, &gt;&gt; the more anointing, &gt;&gt; the more power, &gt;&gt; the more feeling. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? You need to understand this because the devil want you to focus on the enemy. &gt;&gt; But the devil doesn't want you to look at your table. &gt;&gt; Focus on your table and your cup. Your table is full and your cup is already overflowing. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; What does cup run over mean? [Music] &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together, brother? I'm saying in the message, what? &gt;&gt; Who is this? &gt;&gt; He says, I'm sure you all had what? &gt;&gt; Good times this morning, &gt;&gt; this morning. &gt;&gt; Where? &gt;&gt; At the churches around &gt;&gt; and what &gt;&gt; and everything. great water &gt;&gt; turn out &gt;&gt; and the glory of God so that it's what &gt;&gt; really good &gt;&gt; he make us all what &gt;&gt; and the best is just ahead [Applause] &gt;&gt; this service this morning is wonderful but the best is just ahead &gt;&gt; are we together brother problem say see what &gt;&gt; that's right &gt;&gt; tonight will be better than it was when &gt;&gt; this morning &gt;&gt; we just keep doing what &gt;&gt; fill it And then we just keep doing water. &gt;&gt; Running over after a while. &gt;&gt; Just do water. &gt;&gt; Filled up so full. &gt;&gt; And David say my cup does water. &gt;&gt; Runth over. &gt;&gt; I like to get that running over portion. &gt;&gt; Don't you? &gt;&gt; Just go what? &gt;&gt; Running over. &gt;&gt; And then you can do what? &gt;&gt; Help somebody. &gt;&gt; You see when you are what? &gt;&gt; Running over. &gt;&gt; The only way you can help somebody is when your cup is what? when you have more than enough. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Are we together? If the only way you can help other people is when God bless you and then your blessing begin to run over, then you need somebody that you can give it away. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; It takes the enemy to bring that in your life. Yes. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Season in the midst of what? &gt;&gt; Chaos. &gt;&gt; Chaotic. &gt;&gt; In a chaotic place &gt;&gt; where you feel like you not secure anymore. &gt;&gt; You are now more safe. &gt;&gt; Everybody around is a problem. &gt;&gt; Don't worry. It's an opportunity. &gt;&gt; It is a season. &gt;&gt; Don't focus on the enemy. Focus on your cupmen &gt;&gt; because it's not you. It's the Lord who's leading you. &gt;&gt; It is the Lord who's taking you through. &gt;&gt; In other words, when I go through the valley of the shadow of death. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What follow that valley is a table. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; After the valley of the shadow of death, it must be a table. After going through a hard trial, what is coming next is a table. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God is proving to the enemy. She went through the trial. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; She passed the test. Now I'm putting a table and I'm pulling my blessings. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you see the sequence of the scripture? You go fresh out through the valley, &gt;&gt; but don't worry about the valley. Look at the table. &gt;&gt; After the valley, God wait for the enemy to be there. &gt;&gt; The enemy won't die. They need to see. [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together so far? &gt;&gt; Where are we at, my friend? &gt;&gt; Verse six. Verse six, my friend. Then what? &gt;&gt; Surely goodness &gt;&gt; surely what &gt;&gt; goodness &gt;&gt; and what &gt;&gt; and mercy &gt;&gt; shall follow me &gt;&gt; all the days of my life. &gt;&gt; How many days? &gt;&gt; All the days of my life. &gt;&gt; In the valley of death. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Yes. All the day. &gt;&gt; Whether in the valley &gt;&gt; or in green pasture or in still water. Whatever you do all the day or my life whether it's good day or bad day. [Music] [Applause] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Who put your life through what you're going through? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You were following him to church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You were following him to do what what what he's expecting you to do. And suddenly you find yourself in a trial. Who took you to that trial when you trying to do what is good? &gt;&gt; It is not a trial. And if you notice, David is not saying he's leading me to the valley. &gt;&gt; He's walking through. &gt;&gt; It was not a destination. It was just a road, a a pass by. &gt;&gt; So your trial is a pass by. &gt;&gt; That problem is a pass by. That difficulty is a pass by. That road block is a pass by. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He says, "Surely goodness and mercy shall do what?" &gt;&gt; Follow me. &gt;&gt; When? &gt;&gt; All the days of my life. &gt;&gt; And I will dwell in the house of the Lord when &gt;&gt; forever. &gt;&gt; We clear on that one. &gt;&gt; Everybody clear? &gt;&gt; Let's go to Matthew 4. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. Second reading of the scripture. &gt;&gt; A season in the midst of chaos. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Matthew 4. If you there, you can say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We are still reading the Bible, my friend. &gt;&gt; Let's go to verse one. Let's go. Let's go, my friend. &gt;&gt; Then was Jesus led up. &gt;&gt; Jesus was what? Let up &gt;&gt; my friend. Jesus was what? &gt;&gt; Was it the desire? Was it what Jesus want to do? &gt;&gt; So Jesus was what? &gt;&gt; Led up to green pasture. &gt;&gt; No, let's see where they led up by who? Can you read &gt;&gt; of the spirit? &gt;&gt; So who was leading Jesus? &gt;&gt; Ah, please answer me. Who was leading Jesus? &gt;&gt; The spirit. God. &gt;&gt; God. Oh, God is leading Jesus. So, he's taking him to a beautiful place. Oh, wonderful. It is God. Oh, my brother, the Lord is leading me. So, it must be a good place. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus being what? &gt;&gt; Led by who? &gt;&gt; Of the spirit. &gt;&gt; If Jesus was led, what a badass. &gt;&gt; Amen. Jesus being led &gt;&gt; of the what? &gt;&gt; Spirit, &gt;&gt; the Holy Ghost, &gt;&gt; the Holy Ghost was leading Jesus. &gt;&gt; Just like David is saying the Lord is leading. Let's see where does the Holy Ghost take him. &gt;&gt; And he was led of what? &gt;&gt; The spirit. &gt;&gt; Where? &gt;&gt; Into the wilderness. &gt;&gt; What is in the wilderness? Come on. &gt;&gt; A wilderness is a cursed place. &gt;&gt; A wilderness is a place without life. &gt;&gt; Because that's the reason why in the millennium God have to restore and remove the wilderness. &gt;&gt; Because originally the wilderness was not there. &gt;&gt; Instead of God leading Jesus to green pasture, &gt;&gt; spoken word. &gt;&gt; Are we together? God is leading Jesus to what? &gt;&gt; To the wilderness. &gt;&gt; To the wilderness in a dry place. &gt;&gt; Glory. &gt;&gt; How did you get to this dryness? It is the Lord. &gt;&gt; Why are you broke? &gt;&gt; How did you get to this situation? It is God. [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; I'm I'm I'm just screening the radar. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. God lead him to what? &gt;&gt; The wilderness. &gt;&gt; We need to know the purpose. &gt;&gt; What's the purpose? &gt;&gt; What is the purpose for? &gt;&gt; You are leading him to a place that have nothing. &gt;&gt; I want to know what is the reason. What is the purpose of God taking Jesus to a wilderness? &gt;&gt; Because God don't need you just like that. &gt;&gt; He have a purpose. &gt;&gt; What is the purpose, my friend? &gt;&gt; To be tempted of by the devil. &gt;&gt; What was the purpose? &gt;&gt; To be tempted of the devil. &gt;&gt; Did you read your Bible way? &gt;&gt; Come on. &gt;&gt; To be what? &gt;&gt; Tempted of the devil. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. God is leading you to a place &gt;&gt; so that the devil can come over you. &gt;&gt; But remember in the presence of the enemy, [Applause] [Laughter] [Applause] &gt;&gt; are we together my friend? &gt;&gt; Are we together my friend? &gt;&gt; Church, I'm only read just one quote. a second quote because we need to move on. It's the an abundance of water. &gt;&gt; Water. &gt;&gt; David say my cup does water &gt;&gt; runth over. &gt;&gt; It is just a gasher of the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In the m in the presence of your enemy, God open up the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. God is leading Jesus Christ. Where? &gt;&gt; In the wilderness. &gt;&gt; In the wilderness, a dry place for what purpose? &gt;&gt; To be tempted of the devil. &gt;&gt; Have Jesus done something wrong? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Did he sin? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Did he did something contrary to the word? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; So why why why taking him to the temptation? &gt;&gt; In other words, God is telling Jesus, "Hey, Jesus got baptized with the Holy Ghost." He say, "Hey, where father &gt;&gt; GPS wilderness &gt;&gt; uh is there anybody to be prayed for there &gt;&gt; go there someone is there &gt;&gt; who's leading through the valley of the shadow of death &gt;&gt; I hope you are understanding something &gt;&gt; the enemy you try to run away from God is pushing you &gt;&gt; toward him [Laughter] &gt;&gt; to be what? &gt;&gt; Tempted of the devil. &gt;&gt; To be tempted. &gt;&gt; To be tempted by who? By brother. &gt;&gt; The devil. &gt;&gt; The devil himself. &gt;&gt; The devil himself. &gt;&gt; Why do you take a son and put him under the devil? [Laughter] You know, I I'm I am really thanking God I didn't write the Bible. &gt;&gt; I'm just responsible to read it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. To be tempted of the devil. Verse two. And when he fasted what? &gt;&gt; 40 days. &gt;&gt; We got number 40 there. &gt;&gt; 40 days. And what happened? &gt;&gt; 40 nights. &gt;&gt; And then he was what? &gt;&gt; Afterward in hunger. &gt;&gt; He got what? hungry. &gt;&gt; Who put him to that situation of hunger? &gt;&gt; No. Uh oh. We need to know who led him there. &gt;&gt; Now, by leading him there, he's hungry. &gt;&gt; Notice hunger didn't come in the place where there is food. &gt;&gt; The Bible didn't say he got a headache. Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; They target something that is not in the wilderness. &gt;&gt; Which is what? &gt;&gt; Food. &gt;&gt; Food. &gt;&gt; Who led him in the wilderness? &gt;&gt; Spirit. &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost. And who caused him to be hungry? &gt;&gt; Because he didn't want to go there. There is no McDonald here. &gt;&gt; Holy Ghost. Holy Ghost. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So this we found Jesus in the midst of wickedness &gt;&gt; and hungry &gt;&gt; and tired. And when you ask Jesus, how did you get here? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; How did you get to this situation? &gt;&gt; What is the answer? Jesus say it is who? &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; It is It is the Holy Ghost. It is God. &gt;&gt; Ah, you mean God taking you to a place like this? to a situation like this &gt;&gt; until you become hungry &gt;&gt; and then there is no food &gt;&gt; what is God looking at &gt;&gt; break it &gt;&gt; a season in the midst of a chaos [Music] &gt;&gt; are we together &gt;&gt; are we together &gt;&gt; verse uh three and when the what &gt;&gt; tempter &gt;&gt; the devil did what &gt;&gt; came to him Huh? He said, "What? &gt;&gt; If thou be the son of God, &gt;&gt; command what? &gt;&gt; That these stones be made bread. &gt;&gt; If thou be what? &gt;&gt; The son of God, &gt;&gt; command this stone to be what? &gt;&gt; Made bread." &gt;&gt; So the devil now is tempting Jesus Christ on his power &gt;&gt; and identity. &gt;&gt; Glory, glory, glory. &gt;&gt; Because the son of God is God. In other words, &gt;&gt; in other way, the devil is telling Jesus, "If you are truly God, &gt;&gt; yes, sir, &gt;&gt; show me a miracle right there, brother." &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? Look, the condition is a wilderness &gt;&gt; and there is a temptation in the wilderness &gt;&gt; and he's there under number 40 &gt;&gt; and then he's hungry. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then suddenly Jesus speak a scripture. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't know if I will even continue. He says uh but he answer and say what &gt;&gt; it is written. &gt;&gt; It is written what? &gt;&gt; Man shall not live by bread alone &gt;&gt; but by what? every word that proceedth out of the mouth of God. &gt;&gt; Let's push the break. &gt;&gt; This is a court. &gt;&gt; Jesus read a quote. &gt;&gt; This court was the court of Moses. [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; So Jesus was quoting Moses. A prophet, the prophet God himself &gt;&gt; was quoting. &gt;&gt; If God is quoting, what about me? The God of heaven, &gt;&gt; the one who is the author of the word, &gt;&gt; begin to quote a prophet. &gt;&gt; Instead of saying I'm saying, &gt;&gt; I say man shall not live. He say it is written. In other words, Moses said &gt;&gt; in the book of Deuteronomy, &gt;&gt; Jesus quoted another prophet. [Applause] &gt;&gt; That's why we quote another prophet. &gt;&gt; There is power in the calling. [Applause] Are we together? &gt;&gt; So Jesus is calling who? Moses. &gt;&gt; If you run quickly, you will miss something. &gt;&gt; Let's go back to the Old Testament. You don't have to. I have it here on the board for you. You can verify if you want to and find out where did Jesus get that scripture. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. In other word, let me look at the me which message &gt;&gt; Jesus read. &gt;&gt; I need the date &gt;&gt; and the time. &gt;&gt; Brother Manhattan, I need to know which message Jesus uh preach ah which message Moses preach &gt;&gt; so that I can go verify. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Are we together? &gt;&gt; So we got the reference. &gt;&gt; It is in message uh Deuteronomy sir. &gt;&gt; It was preached in uh 8 and in chapter 8. I'm giving you the reference &gt;&gt; so you can go get the message and open up and you can read Moses yourself [Music] &gt;&gt; right my friend. &gt;&gt; Right my friend. &gt;&gt; So let's go and read. Where did Jesus guard this? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. According to Deuteronomy, that's the message. &gt;&gt; So Moses, so Jesus read Deuteronomy. &gt;&gt; He listened to the tape of Deuteronomy. [Applause] &gt;&gt; And Jesus, remember &gt;&gt; what Moses said. [Music] Because Moses said so many things &gt;&gt; in Deuteronomy, &gt;&gt; but out of all of that, &gt;&gt; Jesus picked just this one. &gt;&gt; Why did he only pick this one? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I have not start preaching yet. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen. &gt;&gt; Where in Deuteronomy 8 verse one &gt;&gt; two &gt;&gt; and three the Bible say and thou shall what &gt;&gt; remember &gt;&gt; all the way which the Lord who &gt;&gt; thy God &gt;&gt; did what &gt;&gt; led thee. &gt;&gt; So Israel was led [Laughter] &gt;&gt; church help me so we can move. Moses say sister Sharon. Moses say that Israel was red because I never call her. Today I call her sister say Sharon. I usually pick pick. Today I pick her. Okay. All right. Right. Brother Angelo. Ah. Brother Angelo say thumbs up. Okay. No problem. So Moses is saying that Israel also was led &gt;&gt; by God. [Applause] Are we together? &gt;&gt; And we found Jesus also is led &gt;&gt; by God. &gt;&gt; Where did God in the Old Testament led Israel? &gt;&gt; And how many days [Music] &gt;&gt; are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? The Bible say which the Lord your God did what? &gt;&gt; Let thee &gt;&gt; how many &gt;&gt; these 40 years. &gt;&gt; What number is there? &gt;&gt; 40. &gt;&gt; So Israel &gt;&gt; Israel led by God by the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Come on now. We we already got this this this this we got 40. &gt;&gt; Look at the &gt;&gt; There is a reason why Jesus picked that up. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; So we see number 40 &gt;&gt; and Jesus searched the scripture and say where is the 40? And the 40 came in Deuteronomy. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; He led thee how many what? &gt;&gt; These 40 years &gt;&gt; where &gt;&gt; in the wilderness. &gt;&gt; Where was Jesus himself? [Music] &gt;&gt; Who led Israel in the wilderness? &gt;&gt; With which number? &gt;&gt; 40. &gt;&gt; And Jesus is well &gt;&gt; in the wilderness. With which number? &gt;&gt; 40. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; 40 years to do what? &gt;&gt; Humble thee. &gt;&gt; God leading me to a place to humble me. &gt;&gt; And to do what? &gt;&gt; To prove thee. &gt;&gt; And Jesus was led to be what? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Israel was led to do what? And and what &gt;&gt; proof &gt;&gt; proof means what? &gt;&gt; Test. &gt;&gt; To be tested. &gt;&gt; We missing hunger. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; To know what was where &gt;&gt; in thine heart &gt;&gt; whether thou would keep his commandment or what? &gt;&gt; Or no. &gt;&gt; And he did what? &gt;&gt; Humble thee. &gt;&gt; And suffered thee to what? hunger. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; So when Jesus met the condition, &gt;&gt; that's it. That's it. That's it. That's it. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; There is a reason why Jesus speak that scripture. Because when Jesus look at his condition, &gt;&gt; he map the condition to the Old Testament. I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; And he found out that there is a case like him &gt;&gt; in the Old Testament &gt;&gt; that was wilderness &gt;&gt; testing &gt;&gt; for the &gt;&gt; hunger. Jesus said that's the answer. &gt;&gt; I hope we are. Is it too much? &gt;&gt; Okay. He says to do what? to hunger thee and to do and and he did what? &gt;&gt; Fed thee with mana. &gt;&gt; Fed thee with what? &gt;&gt; Mana. &gt;&gt; Mana. &gt;&gt; There is a new element right here. &gt;&gt; When Israel was hungry, God gave Israel what? &gt;&gt; Mana. &gt;&gt; Mana is the food of what? &gt;&gt; Angels. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. Jump to verse 11 on Matthew 4. &gt;&gt; J to verse 11 on Matthew 4. &gt;&gt; You there? &gt;&gt; You there? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm waiting for folks. We there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. Then the devil did what? &gt;&gt; Leaveth him. &gt;&gt; And behold, what? &gt;&gt; Angels came and ministered unto him. &gt;&gt; So who brought Jesus food? &gt;&gt; Angels. &gt;&gt; Can you verify your Bible? Can you verify your Bible? &gt;&gt; Who brought Jesus the food? Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; And in this temptation, &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Is the place Jesus taught the devil who he was. [Music] &gt;&gt; Go back to verse seven. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Go back to verse seven. Jesus said to him what &gt;&gt; it is written again &gt;&gt; if it is written at them you shall not what &gt;&gt; tempt the Lord &gt;&gt; stop the devil was tempting who &gt;&gt; Jesus &gt;&gt; Jesus &gt;&gt; he was tempting Jesus and Jesus is telling the devil you are tempting who &gt;&gt; God &gt;&gt; the Lord means Elohim &gt;&gt; because David said the Lord is my shepherd &gt;&gt; he say you are tempting the Lord Who? &gt;&gt; Thy God? &gt;&gt; The God. The Lord who? &gt;&gt; Thy God. &gt;&gt; The God of who? &gt;&gt; The devil. &gt;&gt; The devil. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Oh, look at your Bible. He's tempting the He's telling the devil. You are tempting who? &gt;&gt; The Lord thy God. &gt;&gt; The Lord, the God of who? &gt;&gt; The devil. &gt;&gt; In other words, you are tempting your creator. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; So this trial is an opportunity &gt;&gt; giving to Jesus to declare to the devil &gt;&gt; face to face &gt;&gt; who he is. Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't know if we are together. &gt;&gt; Is this too strong? &gt;&gt; Job to verse 10. &gt;&gt; Drop to verse 10. &gt;&gt; Then Jesus did what? &gt;&gt; Say unto him. &gt;&gt; Say to him, do what? &gt;&gt; Get thee. Hence, Satan. &gt;&gt; Because it is what? &gt;&gt; It is written. &gt;&gt; He's quoting again. &gt;&gt; You shall do what? &gt;&gt; Worship the Lord thy God. &gt;&gt; You shall worship who? &gt;&gt; The Lord thy God. So he's telling the devil, you should worship who? &gt;&gt; And him only shall you what? &gt;&gt; Serve. &gt;&gt; In other words, Satan, you need to not not me worshiping you. &gt;&gt; You are the one to worship me and to serve me. &gt;&gt; In other words, Jesus is recalibrating the devil. &gt;&gt; That's it. That's it. If you notice, &gt;&gt; if you notice, the devil say if you are. &gt;&gt; So the devil was not really sure &gt;&gt; of who he was dealing with. &gt;&gt; So God want to clear the devil mind &gt;&gt; about who Jesus is. &gt;&gt; So God led Jesus to the devil &gt;&gt; so he can make sure the devil knows who he's dealing with. So your trial is an opportunity &gt;&gt; that God is giving you &gt;&gt; to unveil yourself &gt;&gt; so the devil know who he's dealing with. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? Jesus could have been looking at the wilderness, &gt;&gt; looking at the temptation, focusing on the hunger and 40 days and whatever, but those were map for him to give him the scripture. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Who led him to this God? &gt;&gt; What looks to be a chaos &gt;&gt; turn to a powerful victory. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen. &gt;&gt; And the Bible say in the book of Luke 4, and when the devil had what? &gt;&gt; Ended all the temptation, &gt;&gt; he departed from him for what? &gt;&gt; A season. &gt;&gt; A season. &gt;&gt; In other words, he got so burned he saidm. &gt;&gt; He departed from Jesus from for a what? &gt;&gt; Season. &gt;&gt; So who got a season? &gt;&gt; So your trial give the devil a season. You didn't get that. &gt;&gt; The trial that you go through will give the devil a season. &gt;&gt; In other words, you're telling the devil for a while, stay away. [Applause] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then Jesus is coming out of that trial. &gt;&gt; Maybe all of us will imagine Jesus coming Oh, &gt;&gt; what happened? I fought with the devil. &gt;&gt; It was rough, man. &gt;&gt; Let's see what the trial did to Jesus. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; He says, "And Jesus returned." How? &gt;&gt; In the power of the &gt;&gt; what? &gt;&gt; He returned how? &gt;&gt; In the power of the &gt;&gt; So, you going to be more powerful after the trial than before the trial. I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; He returned with what? &gt;&gt; In the power of the spirit &gt;&gt; into what? &gt;&gt; Galilee. &gt;&gt; And they went out what? &gt;&gt; A fame of him through &gt;&gt; throughout all the region round about &gt;&gt; that tri open up a big anointing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A miracle in the life of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; A season in the midst of chaos. Watch after the trial. &gt;&gt; It's a blessing. &gt;&gt; It's a blessed season that follow your trial. [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And let's finish our scripture to John 17. &gt;&gt; Then we start preaching. &gt;&gt; I'm going to hurry and then we start preaching. We already toward the 130 coat. Now you are acting like this. &gt;&gt; You there? &gt;&gt; This thing is loaded withund and something code. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; John 17. If you there you can say amen. &gt;&gt; So let's finish our scripture reading verse 14. &gt;&gt; Jesus says what? This is the prayer of Jesus. He's saying what? I have what? &gt;&gt; Given them my word. &gt;&gt; Jesus has given them what? &gt;&gt; Thy word. &gt;&gt; In other words, I gave them the essential thing. &gt;&gt; The man thing were given to them. &gt;&gt; The word. I have given them what? &gt;&gt; Thy word. &gt;&gt; And the world does what? &gt;&gt; Has hated them. &gt;&gt; So do you expect the world to love you &gt;&gt; when you have the word? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; And the world did what? &gt;&gt; Have hated them. Why? &gt;&gt; Because they are not of the world. &gt;&gt; Because they are not what? &gt;&gt; Of the world. &gt;&gt; Even as what? &gt;&gt; I am not of the world. &gt;&gt; So Jesus is saying me and my disciple &gt;&gt; we are not of this world. &gt;&gt; In other words, we are stranger. &gt;&gt; We came from another higher civilization. &gt;&gt; Because of that this world &gt;&gt; will not like you. &gt;&gt; That's why you different. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's why you behave different. &gt;&gt; That's why you act different. &gt;&gt; That's why you dress different. That's why your thinking is different. &gt;&gt; Because you come from somewhere else. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is not your civilization. &gt;&gt; Your civilization is higher than this. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Verse 15. I pray not &gt;&gt; that you shall &gt;&gt; take them out of the world. Ah, &gt;&gt; the world is not our home. &gt;&gt; It's a bad place. &gt;&gt; If it's a bad place, a normal parent &gt;&gt; will snatch you out of the bad place. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Because it's not your home. &gt;&gt; But Jesus is pushing the prayer. &gt;&gt; And we know the prayer of Jesus, I always answer. And instead of Jesus saying, "So because they are not of this world, &gt;&gt; father, take them out quickly, &gt;&gt; Jesus said, &gt;&gt; I'm now praying that you pull them out." &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Ah, so you want us to stay in this condition. &gt;&gt; I wish I can get where I want to go. He say, I pray not that you should what? &gt;&gt; Take them out of the world, &gt;&gt; but that you should what? &gt;&gt; Keep them from the evil. &gt;&gt; I hope we are understanding. Put your seat belt and follow me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus is saying the place is a chaos. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Normally the the the the normal sense way &gt;&gt; is to get you out of chaos. &gt;&gt; Jesus said, "No, no, no, no, no, no, father. Don't get them out of chaos. Don't rest. &gt;&gt; Don't rescue them, &gt;&gt; but just keep them in chaos, &gt;&gt; but keep them from the devil. &gt;&gt; In other word, you have been prayed for. &gt;&gt; To stand in the midst of a cous, [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; let me start it again. Jesus already prayed for you &gt;&gt; so that whenever you find yourself in chaos, &gt;&gt; you won't fail. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Because the purpose of Jesus &gt;&gt; is not to remove you from chaos. &gt;&gt; Jesus want you to stay there &gt;&gt; but he doesn't want you to fail. &gt;&gt; So what is his purpose of living as in a chaos? &gt;&gt; Are we together? He said, "Father, I pray not that you should take them out of the world, but that you do what? &gt;&gt; Keep them from the evil. &gt;&gt; They are not of the world, &gt;&gt; even as I am not of the world." &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; Sanctify them through what? &gt;&gt; Thy truth. &gt;&gt; And your word is what? &gt;&gt; Truth. &gt;&gt; Verse 18. As you have done what? &gt;&gt; Sent me into the world. &gt;&gt; So I do what? &gt;&gt; I have also sent them into the world. &gt;&gt; How did the father send Jesus Christ? &gt;&gt; To him. Exactly. &gt;&gt; How did Jesus come into the word? The father entering Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; And Jesus is saying the same way you send me. &gt;&gt; That's the same way I'm sending them. &gt;&gt; In other words, God is not really sending you. &gt;&gt; God is going with you &gt;&gt; and he is in you &gt;&gt; even with you. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? In other words, God doesn't leave you in the chaos &gt;&gt; and he is outside. &gt;&gt; No, he leave you there and he enter inside of you &gt;&gt; and he sit in the midst of the chaos. &gt;&gt; So that when the devil is coming to you beyond human skin, &gt;&gt; there is a God right there. [Applause] David say he anointed. That was the Old Testament. &gt;&gt; In the New Testament, the anointing is not outside. It is inside of you. &gt;&gt; In other words, the shepherd is right there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I have to skip certain things quickly to get to the point. &gt;&gt; My God. Lord help me. If I read this, we won't get it. &gt;&gt; If I read this, we won't get it. &gt;&gt; I'm trying to skip some so we can get to the because I have now started preaching. &gt;&gt; Let me see what I can skip quickly. [Music] &gt;&gt; Ah. Ah. &gt;&gt; All right. Let's go to Jeremiah 27. I have to skip some of them. I'm sorry. I don't have any choice. Let's go to Jeremiah 27. &gt;&gt; Let me skip. We just started preaching. Okay. &gt;&gt; So, stretch up and everything and &gt;&gt; uh look at your table. Prepare. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If if if you continue this way, how are we going to finish? Let's go to Jeremiah 27 verse one. If you there, you can say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I was trying to get you the the background behind this, but let me leave the background. Let me stay somewhere for closer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh my god. Job to verse uh six. I'm going to skip this again &gt;&gt; if you there. Verse six. He says, "What now? I have given what? &gt;&gt; All these lands." To who? &gt;&gt; The hand of Nebuchadnezzar. &gt;&gt; The king of what? &gt;&gt; Of Babylon. &gt;&gt; Who? &gt;&gt; My servant. &gt;&gt; We all clear on that one. &gt;&gt; Ah, message believer. The Bible is saying Nebuchadnezzar who &gt;&gt; my servant. &gt;&gt; Do you have a problem still with that? &gt;&gt; Do you know who God gave the vision of all the gentile kingdom? &gt;&gt; He gave it to who? Even the capstone &gt;&gt; you have a problem. The capstone ministry, the stone that is coming out of hand and then cutting the mountain, he give it to who? &gt;&gt; So the vision of the gentile &gt;&gt; and the end of the gentile and the ministry of brother Brandon was given to Nebuchadnezzar. If you have any, it's in the book of Daniel. &gt;&gt; And if you go to the book of Daniel, when Nebuchadnezzar begin to get proud, &gt;&gt; God came and corrected him &gt;&gt; and God saved his kingdom. Yes. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; When Nebuchadnezzar was in Brockton Hospital. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Where he had a depression, God kept his throne. &gt;&gt; So that no one become a king &gt;&gt; until his days of depression are finished. &gt;&gt; And Nebuchadnezzar came back and begin to praise the Lord God of Israel. &gt;&gt; It is written in your Bible. &gt;&gt; That's why God said Nebuchadnezzar my servant. [Music] [Applause] Are we together now? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I have given to my servant and he and the what? &gt;&gt; The beast of the field &gt;&gt; that I have done what? &gt;&gt; Have given him? &gt;&gt; Verse seven. And all nations shall do what? &gt;&gt; Serve him &gt;&gt; and do what? &gt;&gt; His son &gt;&gt; and what? &gt;&gt; His son's son. &gt;&gt; And what? &gt;&gt; Until the very time of his land come. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. So Nebuchadnezzar is a servant of the Lord. &gt;&gt; We saw last Sunday that God even gave him a salary. Are we clear? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When we speak about the stories, most of us are struggling &gt;&gt; because of the name Babylon. &gt;&gt; But Babylon was a gentile &gt;&gt; and the king was Nebuchadnezzar. &gt;&gt; And when we talk about captive in Babylon, it is a little bit vague &gt;&gt; because we don't know who is there. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Let's zeroed in and see who are among the captives. Let's go to Daniel 1. [Music] &gt;&gt; Let's go to Daniel chapter one. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Remember the quote, brother Brown, I'm told, brother Navy, you're just getting started. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Let's go to Daniel chapter one. I skip a lot, so I spared you. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's go to chapter one. You there? Amen. &gt;&gt; In the reign of what? &gt;&gt; The third year of the of &gt;&gt; Jehoakim. I was trying to show you all the background of Jehoakim. I put it side. In the third year of the reign of Jehoakim, who &gt;&gt; king of Judah &gt;&gt; came who? &gt;&gt; Nebuchadnezzar. &gt;&gt; Of what? &gt;&gt; King of Babylon. &gt;&gt; To what? &gt;&gt; Jerusalem. &gt;&gt; And did what? &gt;&gt; So we find Nebuchadnezzar in the book of Daniel. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen. &gt;&gt; So Daniel was in the time of Jeremiah. &gt;&gt; We we are we are moving on now. &gt;&gt; We are moving on my friend. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Because when we say Jeremiah we usually think it's another book. No. Jeremiah was in the time of Daniel. &gt;&gt; Daniel was a little boy &gt;&gt; when Jeremiah was prophesying. And the way he knew he was time to go back, it was by reading Jeremiah. &gt;&gt; That's why pastor say read your 70 weeks of Daniel. You should have caught that from there. &gt;&gt; Are we together? So Nebuchadnezzar was in the time of Daniel &gt;&gt; and God took a major prophet &gt;&gt; by the name of Daniel &gt;&gt; and move him to Babylon &gt;&gt; not to Jerusalem &gt;&gt; Babylon &gt;&gt; to Babylon. &gt;&gt; We clear my friend are we clear? &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Verse uh Job to verse uh three so we can spend time. We can spare time. Let's go, my friend. &gt;&gt; And the king spake into &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. And the king spoke to Ashpenas, the master of his unic, &gt;&gt; that he should bring certain of the children of water, &gt;&gt; Israel, &gt;&gt; of the water, &gt;&gt; the king seed. &gt;&gt; So this is a royal seed. &gt;&gt; It's the king's seed. The royal seed. &gt;&gt; So Nebuchadnezzar was looking for a royal seed. Are we together? &gt;&gt; A royal seed and of the water. &gt;&gt; The princes. &gt;&gt; The princes. Come on. Verse four. I'm sorry. Children in whom there is water, &gt;&gt; no blemish, &gt;&gt; but water, &gt;&gt; well favored. &gt;&gt; In other words, the handsome. &gt;&gt; Ah, handsome brothers. Okay, let's go. &gt;&gt; You see, it say handsome. They say they were handsome. That's what the Bible say. Amen. &gt;&gt; The brothers look good. &gt;&gt; They were no blemish. &gt;&gt; They look good. &gt;&gt; And they were what? &gt;&gt; Skillful in &gt;&gt; water. Wisdom &gt;&gt; and in and and cunning in what? &gt;&gt; Knowledge &gt;&gt; and understanding of what? &gt;&gt; Science. &gt;&gt; And such as had ability in them to do what? &gt;&gt; Stand in the king's palace. &gt;&gt; And whom they had to teach the learning and the tongue of what? So Nebuchadnezzar begin to look for some student [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; that are very skillful &gt;&gt; to bring them and to teach them in the language of the Kadine so that they can serve the Babylonian &gt;&gt; not serve the Jews the Babylonian. &gt;&gt; Follow me my friend. We getting somewhere. &gt;&gt; Where are we at my friend? uh verse uh five and the king did what? appointed them a daily pro &gt;&gt; a daily provision of the king's what &gt;&gt; meat. So there is two type here. Of the king's meat, they gave them the king's meat. &gt;&gt; The king's food. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And of the what? &gt;&gt; The wine. &gt;&gt; There is the king meat and the wine. &gt;&gt; This wine is the wine of Babylon. &gt;&gt; Follow me my friend. &gt;&gt; Of the king's meat and the wine. Amen. &gt;&gt; Where? Which he drank. So nourishing them what? 3 years that at the end thereof they must stand before water. &gt;&gt; Now these were the children of Judah &gt;&gt; that went to captivity. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Their name was who? &gt;&gt; Daniel. &gt;&gt; Daniel. So Daniel we because when we went in Jeremiah and Jeremiah say built houses do this. We didn't know who was there. Now we need to know. Now we start knowing some of the people that were there. &gt;&gt; We found out that over there was &gt;&gt; Daniel. That's right. &gt;&gt; In Babylon. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Okay. Remember God already left Jerusalem &gt;&gt; and God went to Babylon. As a matter of fact, when they put Daniel &gt;&gt; and his four uh I mean friend, &gt;&gt; when they put them in the fire, &gt;&gt; I mean Shadrach, Mach, Abene in the fire, God appear in Babylon. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The God of Israel was not there. He appear as a as Mechisedc, &gt;&gt; a son of God in the midst of Babylon. &gt;&gt; So Mechisedc appear in Babylon. &gt;&gt; When you see Babylon, watch for Mechisedc. &gt;&gt; Who is this Melkisedc? [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; I I I hope we are claming. &gt;&gt; Are we together? If you tired, you tell me we stop. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Ah, where are we at? &gt;&gt; Verse six. &gt;&gt; Verse six. Daniel, come. And who? &gt;&gt; Ananiah. And who? &gt;&gt; And who? &gt;&gt; To whom the priest of the unic gave name. For he gave the name to who? &gt;&gt; Daniel. &gt;&gt; The name of who? &gt;&gt; Belazar. &gt;&gt; Belazar. And then Haniah. The name of who? &gt;&gt; Shadrach. &gt;&gt; And then the third one, the name of who? &gt;&gt; Bishia. &gt;&gt; And then the fourth one, the the name of what? I do. &gt;&gt; We clear so far? &gt;&gt; Verse eight. But Daniel, follow me my friend, &gt;&gt; purpose in his heart that he will not defile himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; With the portion of water, &gt;&gt; the king's me, &gt;&gt; nor with the water, &gt;&gt; the one which he drank. &gt;&gt; God is bringing this boy in the midst of a chaos. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But Jesus say, I'm not praying &gt;&gt; that you take them out. Leave them there, &gt;&gt; but only protect them &gt;&gt; from evil. &gt;&gt; Give them the anointing. &gt;&gt; They will know how to separate Babylon from the word of God. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Some of you, your engine are running low, my friend. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You need a jump boost, my friend. &gt;&gt; Let me say it again. Jesus pray. &gt;&gt; He says &gt;&gt; don't get them out of the world. &gt;&gt; Leave them there &gt;&gt; but just keep them &gt;&gt; from the evil. &gt;&gt; So God will never took Daniel out. &gt;&gt; I know what I'm saying &gt;&gt; because I was telling brother Robert &gt;&gt; I say message believer &gt;&gt; we're not trained in the daily lives. That's the truth. &gt;&gt; And the devil use our daily living &gt;&gt; to attack us every day. &gt;&gt; We were trained on the rapture level, &gt;&gt; but never trained on the daily living. &gt;&gt; We were not trained how to live in university. &gt;&gt; We want everybody in the university to be saved. &gt;&gt; That's not the case. &gt;&gt; You must be in the midst of the devil. that you must keep yourself &gt;&gt; from the evil one. &gt;&gt; Lord, help me. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Please shake somebody, my friend. &gt;&gt; We can't play game this time. We need to climb, my friend. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Young people, you who go to university, listen to me. &gt;&gt; You who are going to public school, listen to me. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; I told brother Robert, I said we were not trained &gt;&gt; in how to live a normal life. &gt;&gt; Until when we get into your first job, you lost &gt;&gt; because you want everybody to message believer. &gt;&gt; No. The anointing flows in the midst of a chaos. God never took Daniel back. &gt;&gt; He left Daniel there, &gt;&gt; but he gave him the anointing &gt;&gt; to withstand evil. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; When I'm going to get to this age of La, &gt;&gt; you will be surprised. I'm going to read brother Braham. &gt;&gt; Where are we at? The Bible says he he he will not defile with the portion of water &gt;&gt; nor with the water. &gt;&gt; Therefore he requested of the princes of the unic that he might not defile water &gt;&gt; himself. So we find this young man here, this gentleman here &gt;&gt; in Babylon, very young brother Brandham say he went in the age of 12 &gt;&gt; or 14 years old &gt;&gt; and he's still there in Babylon &gt;&gt; and he was taken captive &gt;&gt; so it's a disaster &gt;&gt; he's leaving the Jerusalem &gt;&gt; he's leaving the temple &gt;&gt; he's leaving the the prophet Jeremiah I &gt;&gt; and going into the land of uh Babylon. &gt;&gt; Who? Because the Bible says, "I'm the Lord who led you to captivity." He was saying there it was the Lord who took Daniel over there. &gt;&gt; Are we together? So the season of Daniel &gt;&gt; was not in in in uh in Israel. &gt;&gt; No sir. The season of Daniel was not over there in Jerusalem, &gt;&gt; not in the holy land. &gt;&gt; The season of Daniel was in the midst of a chaos. [Music] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; So when Daniel goes outside, &gt;&gt; he sees naked women. &gt;&gt; When he goes outside, he sees women with tattoo. He see people drinking &gt;&gt; and he wonder why did you lead me here? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; But the promotion of Daniel in Babylon, &gt;&gt; the vision of Daniel in Babylon. [Music] &gt;&gt; Father, help me up. Listen to this, my friend. Brother Brham says this for those who have a hard time now because this is a hard lesson. &gt;&gt; If you tired I need to stop &gt;&gt; because this end game &gt;&gt; in the message water &gt;&gt; hearing &gt;&gt; and what &gt;&gt; recognizing &gt;&gt; and what &gt;&gt; acting on the word of God. &gt;&gt; We will know it today as the law of what? &gt;&gt; Contrast. Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Tell your friend &gt;&gt; don't leave this church without understanding contrast. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We clear. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You finished? &gt;&gt; Now pay attention please. &gt;&gt; He says &gt;&gt; that where there is what? &gt;&gt; Good. &gt;&gt; There is what? &gt;&gt; Evil. season in the midst of what &gt;&gt; chaos. &gt;&gt; We all want to remove everything. &gt;&gt; It doesn't work like that &gt;&gt; in the presence of your enemy. [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Jesus will lead you. God will lead Jesus Christ in the wilderness. &gt;&gt; Brother, brother said, remember this &gt;&gt; from today. There is a law called the law of water. &gt;&gt; Contrast. &gt;&gt; You who are in high school, mid school or whatever, pay attention. If you are sad, come back in here. &gt;&gt; If you are in the bathroom, come back here. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; There is a law of contrast that where there is what &gt;&gt; good, &gt;&gt; there is what? &gt;&gt; Evil. &gt;&gt; Where there is what? &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; There is what? &gt;&gt; Wrong. &gt;&gt; And we will never [Music] In this world, &gt;&gt; in this world, &gt;&gt; even if you create a message camp &gt;&gt; where nobody's there but only message people, &gt;&gt; remember this. &gt;&gt; Even in the church, remember this. [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; Make sure everybody that is outside come back here.

In other word, you cannot function correctly &gt;&gt; without adversity. &gt;&gt; Even in the church. [Music] &gt;&gt; That's why people have a problem in the church. &gt;&gt; Because when they come in the church, you have your own conception. &gt;&gt; Everybody must be nice. &gt;&gt; You are wrong. And then when you get offended by somebody, you want to leave the church, you go to another church, you found it. &gt;&gt; You need to be tough. [Applause] &gt;&gt; In other words, if I'm receiving my daily food in that church, &gt;&gt; I don't care what you're doing. [Applause] I am not &gt;&gt; I am not going to leave my blessing &gt;&gt; to please you. &gt;&gt; This is how many people are missing the blessing &gt;&gt; because they get offended sometime. It's not the pastor. &gt;&gt; It might be your brother. &gt;&gt; It might be your sister. &gt;&gt; It might be your deacon. But remember a season &gt;&gt; sir &gt;&gt; in the midst of a chaos [Music] &gt;&gt; father help me my friend &gt;&gt; listen to this my friend &gt;&gt; where are we my friend brother say no matter what environment may be &gt;&gt; ever be able to shake ourel from what &gt;&gt; the presence of ether &gt;&gt; because Paul said when I will do what &gt;&gt; good &gt;&gt; what what is there &gt;&gt; then evil is present. &gt;&gt; You anointed me in the presence of what? &gt;&gt; In the presence of evil. &gt;&gt; Even among the disciple, &gt;&gt; God have to pick a Judah. &gt;&gt; He was necessary. [Applause] &gt;&gt; If you were Judas, is that your problem? &gt;&gt; But me, I'm preaching to the seed of God. [Applause] [Music] Brother, &gt;&gt; are we together? &gt;&gt; Brother, brother say when I will do good, what happened? &gt;&gt; Then evil is present. &gt;&gt; The sinner will never &gt;&gt; be able to shake away from what? &gt;&gt; The Christian. &gt;&gt; The Christian from what? &gt;&gt; The sinner. &gt;&gt; There will be a what? &gt;&gt; A witness there. &gt;&gt; Of what? &gt;&gt; Of right. &gt;&gt; And a testimony of what? &gt;&gt; Of wrong. &gt;&gt; How many time? &gt;&gt; Always. [Music] You go to work, it's there. &gt;&gt; To your school, it's there. &gt;&gt; To the campus, it's there. &gt;&gt; In Walmart, it's there. &gt;&gt; At the restaurant, it's there. [Music] &gt;&gt; Instead of focusing to the bad, &gt;&gt; look at your season. [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together?

Boom. &gt;&gt; They drop them. &gt;&gt; Younger boys 12, 14 years old. &gt;&gt; And then suddenly you need to eat this. &gt;&gt; And Daniel stood. He said, "Uh-uh. I know I ain't leaving there, &gt;&gt; but I'm not going to do this &gt;&gt; because the prayer of Jesus Christ, don't take him up, &gt;&gt; leave them there, &gt;&gt; but just keep him from the evil. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Listen to brother Brandham. Brother Brham say, but he has been in the &gt;&gt; very midst &gt;&gt; in the very midst of Babylon. &gt;&gt; Nobody but what? &gt;&gt; Three companions.

[Music] &gt;&gt; We don't have to be two on campus. &gt;&gt; Even if I'm alone, [Music] &gt;&gt; that's enough. &gt;&gt; Daniel standing. alone with who? &gt;&gt; The shepherd. He had the victory for what? &gt;&gt; 68 years. &gt;&gt; 68 years. Where? &gt;&gt; Daniel never said that. You know what? &gt;&gt; I need to leave Babylon and go back to Jerusalem. &gt;&gt; I'm staying in Babylon. &gt;&gt; His work was in Babylon. He was in school &gt;&gt; with other children. &gt;&gt; He didn't quit school &gt;&gt; because everybody seen it. &gt;&gt; He just stood on his ground &gt;&gt; compared to the other children &gt;&gt; until the teacher made the difference that there is a difference between these boys and all the boys. &gt;&gt; Children, are you following me?

It's seen everywhere. &gt;&gt; Hey, &gt;&gt; after all the words you heard, &gt;&gt; you are the master of circumstances. [Applause] [Music] When you enter school, you look you say, "Father, &gt;&gt; may I be an example for them &gt;&gt; so that one day they will ask me, why am I different? &gt;&gt; Let me make a difference. &gt;&gt; Not compromise with them. &gt;&gt; Are we together, &gt;&gt; my friend? Are we together?" When you go to school, they must see you differently. You cannot play with other people. &gt;&gt; You don't need everybody to be there. You alone. [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; Father, help me. &gt;&gt; How many years? &gt;&gt; Think of it. &gt;&gt; I don't want to start preaching &gt;&gt; because this is supposed to be a teaching message. &gt;&gt; But how many years? 68 years &gt;&gt; he kept the what? &gt;&gt; The victory &gt;&gt; and was how &gt;&gt; undefiled before God. &gt;&gt; God never took Daniel out &gt;&gt; because God is trying to prove the devil something. &gt;&gt; Never. And he was what? &gt;&gt; Undefiled &gt;&gt; before who? &gt;&gt; God. &gt;&gt; Without what? &gt;&gt; The baptism of the Holy Ghost. [Music] [Applause] I made a mistake because I didn't have the Holy Ghost yet. &gt;&gt; Daniel without the Holy Ghost. [Music] &gt;&gt; In Jerusalem, &gt;&gt; in Jerusalem, you can be a hypocrite. &gt;&gt; In Babylon is where we see the true color. You are now moving my friend. Flat tent and prepare for landing. &gt;&gt; He says without the water &gt;&gt; baptism of the Holy Ghost &gt;&gt; without what? &gt;&gt; The blood of Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; to make intercession for him &gt;&gt; with only the blood of what? &gt;&gt; Bulls and goats &gt;&gt; and what? &gt;&gt; And heers &gt;&gt; which he had to offer. How? &gt;&gt; Secretly &gt;&gt; because of the hidden tradition of the land. Lord &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham say I want you to notice how Daniel yet what &gt;&gt; an alien &gt;&gt; yet what &gt;&gt; ousted from his people &gt;&gt; ousted from what? &gt;&gt; His church &gt;&gt; without one church service. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You take a message, believe a child. &gt;&gt; You put him on campus, total lost. &gt;&gt; Tomorrow, pregnancy, &gt;&gt; tomorrow, leave the message. &gt;&gt; The message is [Applause] &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; He says, "Without one church service, without what? &gt;&gt; Any church to go to?" without what &gt;&gt; any hymns to be sang &gt;&gt; but what he did what &gt;&gt; saying himself &gt;&gt; so who was singing with &gt;&gt; Daniel &gt;&gt; himself &gt;&gt; Daniel didn't meet brother John P &gt;&gt; he didn't meet brother set &gt;&gt; where he is he's worshiping the lord in the midst of Babylon [Applause] &gt;&gt; you are even fortunate you iPad [Applause] &gt;&gt; why don't you sit under the tree and put on brother Brana &gt;&gt; and put on your nice Christian music and listen to it &gt;&gt; all you come up with is the devil the devil Satan Satan this happened on campus this happened on campus where were your eyes at &gt;&gt; are we together &gt;&gt; in the midst of what &gt;&gt; all this &gt;&gt; he still what &gt;&gt; held on to what the prophet Amen. &gt;&gt; Is in the midst of what &gt;&gt; he was holding on to what Jeremiah &gt;&gt; the prophet said &gt;&gt; regardless of what was going on &gt;&gt; in campus on Walmart his problem is let me stand with the word &gt;&gt; father help us. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; No what &gt;&gt; church to go to. Nobody to do what? &gt;&gt; Fellowship with &gt;&gt; I don't have any friend in school. &gt;&gt; You don't need a friend. &gt;&gt; You got a friend in Jesus. You don't need a friend. &gt;&gt; I'm only alone in school. Young people, you don't need a friend. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I know this is hard. &gt;&gt; I know this is hard. You can have a classmate, but you don't need a friend. A friend is different than a classmate. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because how can two fellowship except today? &gt;&gt; You don't agree. Where is your fellowship? [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; I found a friend. He's even better than message believer. &gt;&gt; A liar. [Applause] Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Not even a friend, a friend, and nobody to fellowship with. Everybody went to what? &gt;&gt; He temple. &gt;&gt; Everybody worship what? &gt;&gt; Their idols. &gt;&gt; No Christian song. Nobody believe the same thing he did. &gt;&gt; So why do you go on campus and you want people to believe like you? &gt;&gt; Why do you go on school and you want people to believe like you? You get in Walmart and you about to pass out like everybody in Walmart should believe the message. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; And in what? &gt;&gt; Don't worry, we heading to the airport. 68 years from a young man about what? &gt;&gt; 12. &gt;&gt; 14 years old when he was what? &gt;&gt; Taken down. &gt;&gt; But what did he do? &gt;&gt; Hell true to God. And he understood by who? &gt;&gt; Jeremiah's prophet &gt;&gt; that the days were almost what? &gt;&gt; Accomplished &gt;&gt; in Babylon. He was reading Jeremiah. &gt;&gt; His eyes was on bad. &gt;&gt; When he's on campus, if he has a downtown, he's reading the seven churches, &gt;&gt; eating his sandwich. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If you ask him how was school today, he say it was fun. &gt;&gt; Mom, I was reading something brother Brandham said. &gt;&gt; You were reading something brother. Yes. He didn't see anything that is going on in school. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother say Daniel taking the word of what? &gt;&gt; From Jeremiah &gt;&gt; goes down where? &gt;&gt; Into Babylon. &gt;&gt; He enter Babylon with the scroll of Jeremiah. &gt;&gt; That's all he need. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Where are you at? In Babylon. &gt;&gt; But I got Jeremiah. &gt;&gt; That's all I need. As long as I got Jeremiah in Babylon &gt;&gt; because Jeremiah prophesy about Babylon. &gt;&gt; As long as the message &gt;&gt; in the midst of this Babylon. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Are we together? &gt;&gt; He said, "And he was the what? &gt;&gt; Anointed prophet." He performed what? &gt;&gt; Miracles &gt;&gt; and what? &gt;&gt; A sign. &gt;&gt; Could interpret what? &gt;&gt; Unknown tongues &gt;&gt; and done signs and wonder where &gt;&gt; among them &gt;&gt; among the Jews. &gt;&gt; Where? &gt;&gt; Babylon. &gt;&gt; So the working field of Daniel &gt;&gt; was in Babylon, &gt;&gt; not in Jerusalem. &gt;&gt; His season was in Babylon. He have to manifest God among the hidden. That's it. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; I know some of you want to go home. Don't worry. We heading to the airport. Amen. Amen. He don't stand and wand among them. Yet standing how? &gt;&gt; Alone. &gt;&gt; How? &gt;&gt; By himself. &gt;&gt; He stood how? &gt;&gt; Alone. &gt;&gt; You are more focusing on Babylon. &gt;&gt; Who's the prime minister on Babylon? They just changed the prime minister. &gt;&gt; They changed the governor of the state. Quit looking at that. &gt;&gt; Focus on what is important. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; This boy stood and refused the king's meat &gt;&gt; and refused the wine of the king. &gt;&gt; What does the king mix represent? &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Brother said there was no man. There was a man named who? Daniel once. &gt;&gt; Who did who was where? &gt;&gt; In the lion's den. &gt;&gt; Do you know who appeared in the lion's den? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; He was who? &gt;&gt; The Lord in which form? &gt;&gt; The pillar of fire. &gt;&gt; So, the pillar of fire was no longer in Israel. &gt;&gt; I hope you are swallowing that. I hope you can swallow that. I hope you are swallowing that. The pillar of fire left Israel and appear where &gt;&gt; in the midst of a chaos. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; And my question is why did the pillar of fire appear? &gt;&gt; What was the what triggered the pillar of fire to appear? &gt;&gt; Because Daniel was praying every day. &gt;&gt; The pillar of fire never appeared. &gt;&gt; Chaos. Yes, &gt;&gt; the pillar of fire never appear. &gt;&gt; But when they begin to put pressure on prayer, &gt;&gt; when the persecution come &gt;&gt; above prayer &gt;&gt; and they put him in the lion's den in the presence of my enemy, the pillar of fire appear. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Not in Israel, in Babylon. Until the king begin to pray for Daniel. &gt;&gt; Is my Bible different than yours? &gt;&gt; The king Saras was praying for Daniel &gt;&gt; and he woke up in the morning and came say are you still alive? He say yes king I'm alive &gt;&gt; in the midst of lion &gt;&gt; in the midst of lion that's when the pillar of fire came [Applause] &gt;&gt; a season to see God in the midst of lion when they hid it the furnace seven times &gt;&gt; in the midst of the fire &gt;&gt; you didn't get me my friend when they were praying at home God ever appear. &gt;&gt; But when they put them in the fire &gt;&gt; and they hid it the fire seven time, when they increase the trial, it brings God down. [Applause] &gt;&gt; And now they were fellowshipping with God. &gt;&gt; A season in the midst of a chaos. &gt;&gt; Amen. What are you trying to say? &gt;&gt; Let's stop on uh this thought and I hit the air the tarmac brother say he went down where &gt;&gt; into Babylon &gt;&gt; and he said in himself that he was not going to do what? &gt;&gt; Defile himself with the king's meat. &gt;&gt; The king's meat. Come he was not going to have anything to do with what? &gt;&gt; The world. &gt;&gt; He said in himself &gt;&gt; that's it. I don't need anybody to help me. &gt;&gt; I'm going there, but I'm not going to defile myself. &gt;&gt; I'm going to get into campus, but I won't defile myself. &gt;&gt; I'm going to go to school, but I won't defile myself. &gt;&gt; It's a decision &gt;&gt; without the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Friend or no friend, that is not my problem. &gt;&gt; I came here to get education &gt;&gt; and once I finish education, I'm out. I don't need no alpha, capa, theta, whatever. &gt;&gt; I don't need to go to the ball game. &gt;&gt; I don't need to go to anything. &gt;&gt; I came here to get education. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; He says through though he had lived where? &gt;&gt; Among them people &gt;&gt; but he was not going to what? &gt;&gt; He was living among them. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. He purposed his heart that what &gt;&gt; he wasn't. &gt;&gt; Look at this my friend brother and the Bible says in the book of Revelation 17 that and there came one of the seven angel which have what &gt;&gt; the seven vows &gt;&gt; and talk with me saying unto me do what? &gt;&gt; Come hither. &gt;&gt; I will show unto thee the judgment of what? &gt;&gt; The great &gt;&gt; that city water &gt;&gt; many waters &gt;&gt; with whom the kings of the earth has committed what? fornication. &gt;&gt; And the inhabitant of the earth has been made drunk with the what? &gt;&gt; Wine of her fornication. &gt;&gt; The wine of what? &gt;&gt; Her fornication. &gt;&gt; Remember Daniel refused one over there. And it was the wine of Babylon. &gt;&gt; And the Bible say upon her forehead. &gt;&gt; The one who had the wine was written what? &gt;&gt; Mystery Babylon. &gt;&gt; It was the wine of Babylon. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Brother, brother say she had a cup in her hand full of what? &gt;&gt; Wine of her fornication. &gt;&gt; Her water, &gt;&gt; her filthiness, &gt;&gt; her doctrine &gt;&gt; that she c she was causing the kings. Oh, just have a little prayer and pray you out of her purgatory and all these things and there you are. So the wine was the doctrine, the teaching of Babylon. &gt;&gt; He was in Babylon but not in the teaching of Babylon. He has the internet, but he didn't get on the teaching of the internet. &gt;&gt; He used the internet for what is normal. &gt;&gt; He knew how to get on the internet, &gt;&gt; but stay focused. [Music] &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Daniel was not removed from Babylon. &gt;&gt; But in Babylon, he was separated by his faith. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because in Revelation 18, the Bible say, "Come out of it. &gt;&gt; Come out of the system, &gt;&gt; the religion of Babylon, but it doesn't tell you leave this world. &gt;&gt; You didn't get me. &gt;&gt; The coming out of Babylon is not that you're going to leave this world &gt;&gt; and go build a message camp. You stay in the midst of it, but you come off from the system. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right, let's finish with this my friend. Brother say in Germany once I saw a picture and it always does what? &gt;&gt; Stuck with me. &gt;&gt; What is that picture, my friend? &gt;&gt; A German painter has painted a picture that's called the cloud land. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. And when you see it off at a distance, it's the horriblest looking gloom you ever seen. &gt;&gt; When you look at that picture from far off, &gt;&gt; it looks like something very horrible. &gt;&gt; Amen. Go ahead. &gt;&gt; Just clouds mattered together. &gt;&gt; Cloud mattered together. When you are looking it from what? &gt;&gt; A long distance. &gt;&gt; But when you get where &gt;&gt; real close to it, &gt;&gt; it does what? &gt;&gt; It changes. &gt;&gt; It's water. It's angels &gt;&gt; wings beating water &gt;&gt; together &gt;&gt; singing water &gt;&gt; hallelujah to the Lord &gt;&gt; in the midst of a chaos. &gt;&gt; So that is that is what gloom is sometime &gt;&gt; if you look at it a long distance it looks what &gt;&gt; gloomy and dark &gt;&gt; but take God how &gt;&gt; at his word &gt;&gt; and be certain that he's God and move up how &gt;&gt; close to it &gt;&gt; not away from it. [Laughter] Not away from it. Move what? &gt;&gt; Close to it. &gt;&gt; You shall find out that it's just what &gt;&gt; angel's wings are beating together. &gt;&gt; Amen. And brother Brandham says this, we think we have it hard. &gt;&gt; And sometime trials come and I think of this woman where &gt;&gt; in the wheelchair &gt;&gt; and these children, you are there with a hot trouble. Maybe dead in the week from now, eat up with cancer. Amen. Look how &gt;&gt; awful dark. But if you just keep getting how &gt;&gt; coming closer to God &gt;&gt; and find out his purpose &gt;&gt; it is what &gt;&gt; angels of God &gt;&gt; ready to what &gt;&gt; rejoice for a victory &gt;&gt; that God want to give sometime it is what &gt;&gt; in disguisement &gt;&gt; it's a blessing in dis in disguisement it looks bad &gt;&gt; but the shepherd is leading you &gt;&gt; and if God is leading you no matter how bad it is &gt;&gt; in the midst of a chaos Watch for the season. &gt;&gt; Let's stop here. &gt;&gt; Let's stand. &gt;&gt; You go chew this and we pick up again. &gt;&gt; Then we will pick up Jeremiah 29. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Who is leading? If he's leading me, why is this happening? &gt;&gt; Because we thought when he's he's leading us, we are shielded. &gt;&gt; No, he's calibrating everything. &gt;&gt; He's protecting Job. &gt;&gt; He's the one that lift the ages &gt;&gt; for a purpose. Amen. &gt;&gt; But when he left the hedges, he didn't leave Job alone. &gt;&gt; He was still right there monitoring everything that is going on. &gt;&gt; It's a shepherd that is leading you. &gt;&gt; Not to take you out. Daniel could get in Babylon and keep focusing in Palestine. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Palestine was a direction of prayer. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Because he need to stay by the word. &gt;&gt; That's right. And the word say if you in a foreign land just look for the direction of Jerusalem. &gt;&gt; So he had to apply the word to get his prayer answered. &gt;&gt; But he didn't know that the entire kingdom the entire capstone ministry everything was given to Daniel. Not in Jerusalem. It was given over there. The angel of the Lord appeared there. The pillar of fire appear over there. And you will see later how God is working with those kings &gt;&gt; because he called Nebuchadnezzar his servant. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Whoever is on top just know that the servant of God &gt;&gt; even your supervisor there have nothing to do &gt;&gt; because Jesus look at pilot he said there is no power given to you except it's given from the Lord. In other words you can do nothing but what has been authorized there. You're not my boss. &gt;&gt; I'm going to respect you, but I know everything that is happening. If I get fired, it was my day to go. &gt;&gt; But it's not my day. You ain't going to do nothing. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They will cut a time. We will get to the millennium &gt;&gt; and the devil will be bound. &gt;&gt; But this is the time the devil is unbound. &gt;&gt; But he's unbound not to scare you. In the midst of chaos, that's when the anointing run off &gt;&gt; and you will see how the third pull ran off with this. &gt;&gt; Let's pray. Heavenly Father, &gt;&gt; Lord, we approaching you humbly this afternoon. Father, thanking you for your grace, for your love and your mercy, and for everything you have been doing for us. Father, this is as far as we could go with, Lord, the ability that you have given us. Lord, I pray that this drive home and that you help your children, you help our children that you have given us to stand in the midst of chaos. Father, we all wish we can go to heaven. We all wish the rapture comes and then we can leave this sickly world. We all wish that the millennium start right now. But there is still a mission to fulfill. &gt;&gt; There is still a purpose of us being here. And Lord, the devil has multiplied destruction so that we can miss from our focus and then we can pay attention to him and don't realize what you're doing in the midst of this horrible loudisha that we're living in. Father, may you help us keep our nose above the water Lord so that we know Lord Father that you are the shepherd. No matter which direction we are going, you are still there and we are in comfort zone. Not because of what we see outside but because of the creator of heaven and earth that is living in us. Father take the oncoming weak unto the hand. Protect us under your blood. May you strengthen us. I claim the blood upon everything that is connected to me Lord. Every demonic spirit that will try to attack on Monday. Father may blood be put everywhere in my work at home in our family in this church everywhere. Lord, may you stand up Lord. Father, like you did for Shadrach, Mach, and Abednego, and Nad, may that same pillar of fire stand between us and the work of darkness. We thank you and commit everything unto their hand in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you, church. We love you. [Music] Remember choir practice after uh the service. Five minutes. [Music] A pilgrim was I and a wondering in the cold night of sin I did wrong. When Jesus the kind shepherd found me and now I am on my way home. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days all the days of my life. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days all the days of my life. He restoreth my soul when I'm weary. He gives me strength in my day. He leads me beside the still waters. He guards me except the way. Surely good shall follow me all the days. All the days of my life.
