[26:44] don't know if there's anybody in here
[26:46] god bless you
[26:50] get your
[27:04] it was on monday
[27:09] my son goes
[27:14] on he put a little bottle or bottle cap
[27:17] excuse me
[27:32] we didn't know what was going on it was
[27:33] a complicated situation
[27:35] they decept from 5 p.m
[27:39] event was uh all the way to 11 p.m
[27:45] we didn't know that that the son had a
[27:47] bottle cap
[27:48] on his throat
[27:54] and we saw we saw it the throat started
[27:56] to swollen
[28:00] and on his left side was all swollen
[28:05] and we tell ourselves what's going on
[28:08] and the son came to us
[28:14] and he showed me that i had something on
[28:15] his throat
[28:18] and i told him
[28:23] you got something on your throat and he
[28:26] took me
[28:32] so he was leading me to see if there's
[28:34] something we can do to take the thing
[28:36] out of his throat
[28:40] and his mother
[28:51] [Music]
[29:17] [Music]
[29:24] the child was playing as as usual
[29:29] so we don't know when did this follow
[29:31] this thing
[29:33] after a while
[29:36] [Music]
[29:39] i realize that we have the god of heaven
[29:40] who can intervene to our situation
[29:50] my first reflection that came to my mind
[29:51] was to call the pastor
[30:08] he told me the law has a power is able
[30:10] to do that the child
[30:11] can throw up that thing
[30:22] and say also that they can put something
[30:24] in his mouth to take away the bottle cap
[30:26] that's on his torch
[30:33] which was a person by the team all the
[30:35] bodies i have called account for me
[30:37] through the prayers
[30:39] after a while the doctor came back
[30:46] [Music]
[30:47] and he told me i believe that we can
[30:49] open up this side
[30:52] [Music]
[30:54] so that way we can take out the bottle
[30:55] cap that's on his torch
[31:00] and i was once again lost
[31:17] [Music]
[31:27] [Music]
[31:30] warfare sortier so the nurse told us
[31:33] that i have talked to
[31:35] specialists that we can take the child
[31:36] to the hospital so that way they can
[31:38] remove that thing
[31:42] and i told you my brothers and sisters
[31:58] i can tell you that the god of heaven as
[32:00] intervened so we left from
[32:01] seven i'm sorry from 5 p.m all the way
[32:04] to 8 a.m in the morning
[32:05] went to the hospital where they could
[32:06] remove that thing
[32:12] and the doctor was amazed at how was a
[32:14] child breathing
[32:24] so that thing blocked the space between
[32:27] the throat
[32:28] and the stomach
[32:32] and you say that place right there that
[32:34] area
[32:39] is a tube where the air goes in through
[32:41] so you can breathe
[32:47] it's hard to breathe when there's
[32:49] something on that space to that's
[32:51] blocking it
[32:54] and after that he told me
[32:58] we're going to put the child to sleep
[33:02] and we'll move that thing that's
[33:03] blocking
[33:05] us grace
[33:08] is
[33:38] it was by god's grace that we took the
[33:40] child and they was able to remove that
[33:42] thing and now the child
[33:43] is well he's walking he's breathing and
[33:46] all that i just want to thank the lord
[33:47] every time that i walk i remind myself
[33:49] of that
[33:50] and i say that i always praise the lord
[33:52] for that
[33:55] may the lord be blessed
[33:57] [Applause]

[36:06] we want to thank you father for getting
[36:07] each and every one of us here safely
[36:10] i want to thank you lord for this
[36:11] resurrection morning as our brother
[36:13] testified
[36:14] sunday is a day of worship but this is
[36:16] especially a good one because this is
[36:18] the day you rose from the dead
[36:20] and you proved lord that you are the
[36:22] mighty conqueror
[36:24] lord everything is finished because
[36:26] that's what you said when you went
[36:27] to that grave you said it is finished
[36:30] so whatever it may be this morning it
[36:32] may be sickness
[36:34] it may be a financial uh situation it
[36:37] may be
[36:38] a law there are so many needs we can't
[36:40] even mention them all
[36:41] but all we know that it is finished lord
[36:43] because you declared it and we believe
[36:46] it and we are partakers thereof
[36:48] so we want to thank you lord even for
[36:49] the testimony that our brother gave
[36:51] how you serve this child from that
[36:53] critical situation
[36:55] it just goes to show that you are still
[36:57] a prayer answering god
[36:59] and for that we are grateful this
[37:00] morning to know that
[37:02] we are not saving a dead god but we are
[37:04] serving the god with our life
[37:06] the god of brother branham the god of
[37:08] those three hebrew boys
[37:09] the god who performed so many wonders in
[37:12] the time that has gone by
[37:13] and you can still perform even now lord
[37:15] jesus christ you are still the same
[37:17] because the bible says you are the same
[37:19] yesterday today and forever so lord we
[37:22] are very thankful
[37:23] to be worshipping such a god as you may
[37:26] you help us now lord as the song service
[37:28] goes on
[37:29] may you continue to anoint the song
[37:30] leader continue to anoint the musicians
[37:33] lord we pray that you are knowing also
[37:36] the minister as he shall stand
[37:37] behind the sacred desk here may we see
[37:40] beyond the veil and may
[37:41] we see you speaking to us so that as we
[37:44] go out of these doors lord
[37:46] we will say it was good that we came for
[37:48] we have been been made
[37:50] better believers better christians
[37:52] better candidates of the rapture
[37:54] we thank you father because we know you
[37:55] have never failed us yet
[37:57] so come and meet with each and every one
[37:59] of us this morning
[38:00] we pray also lord at this moment in time
[38:02] for the tides and offerings that are
[38:04] going to be given
[38:04] may you bless your children in a special
[38:06] way even those who may not be able to
[38:09] give
[38:09] may you bless them so that if there's a
[38:11] next time they'll also be able to
[38:13] partake in this service
[38:14] we pray lord you're granted even those
[38:16] who may not be here this morning

[1:09:58] visitor we have family members
[1:10:02] so welcome into the family thank you
[1:10:04] very much musician you might take your
[1:10:06] seat for a little bit
[1:10:09] as we've given uh
[1:10:13] it's easter a wonderful week
[1:10:17] i tried to get in the easter channel
[1:10:21] but your boss keep pulling me back
[1:10:26] amen blessed be the name of the lord you
[1:10:29] heard brother paul and giving a
[1:10:31] testimony here
[1:10:32] so basically he called me and his child
[1:10:36] his first son swallowed like a
[1:10:40] bottle top or something and he choked
[1:10:43] him but for some reason he was still
[1:10:45] breathing
[1:10:46] and his neck begin to swell
[1:10:49] but the child was breathing and
[1:10:51] everything normal so
[1:10:53] it's a paradox normally he should be
[1:10:56] choking or something like that
[1:10:58] and the devil was trying to snatch that
[1:11:00] life just like that
[1:11:02] by the resurrected crust amen
[1:11:08] the lord jesus christ watch over the
[1:11:10] child
[1:11:11] and by his grace that's what came out
[1:11:17] that was what was in it amen
[1:11:21] he could have went through a surgery
[1:11:23] when they opened up and
[1:11:26] pull everything apart to go search it
[1:11:29] but for some reason they put something
[1:11:31] there
[1:11:31] and pop it up the same guard that can
[1:11:34] take a piece of iron
[1:11:36] from the bottom of the river and made it
[1:11:38] float with a piece of wood
[1:11:40] is the same god that pulled this thing
[1:11:43] out and the child is hard this morning
[1:11:45] we serve the living god amen
[1:11:49] blessed be the name of the lord just
[1:11:51] something about
[1:11:52] easter brother branham said that is the
[1:11:55] greatest week in history
[1:11:58] the greatest celebration of all time
[1:12:02] this easter is where he proved what he
[1:12:05] had said
[1:12:07] amen man can say things
[1:12:10] but yet it is not exactly can be
[1:12:13] believed
[1:12:14] upon thoroughly until it's been proven
[1:12:17] to be the truth
[1:12:19] and ask god who said of things
[1:12:22] hold fast to that which is good he will
[1:12:26] not tell you to do something that he
[1:12:28] will not do himself
[1:12:30] so he proved who this was that
[1:12:33] died for our sin in other words it has
[1:12:36] been proven thoroughly
[1:12:38] and we have a right to hold fast to
[1:12:40] christ because christ
[1:12:42] resurrected from the dead amen brother
[1:12:45] branham say
[1:12:45] easter greetings to you all this morning
[1:12:49] very happy to be here today in the
[1:12:51] tabernacle
[1:12:52] on this great memorial time of the
[1:12:55] easter the lord has given us a beautiful
[1:12:59] day for this worship
[1:13:00] and we are here this morning in
[1:13:02] celebration
[1:13:04] of the greatest event that ever happened
[1:13:07] in the world the resurrection of
[1:13:10] our lord jesus
[1:13:14] he was great in his death but man can
[1:13:18] die
[1:13:19] but there never was a man who could
[1:13:21] raise from the dead but
[1:13:22] oh him and there is where our hopes laid
[1:13:26] this morning
[1:13:27] in the resurrection of our lord
[1:13:31] you want to know him in the power of
[1:13:33] water
[1:13:34] his resurrection thank you jesus for
[1:13:38] rising from the dead
[1:13:40] now we are approaching easter and as you
[1:13:43] get in your places and marking it down
[1:13:45] i think that this coming week is the
[1:13:48] most
[1:13:48] and the greatest historical week of all
[1:13:52] the weeks of the year i think that the
[1:13:55] greatest things
[1:13:57] we will celebrate this week this coming
[1:14:00] week
[1:14:00] which is today was the greatest event
[1:14:03] that ever take place
[1:14:04] on earth i don't think anything could
[1:14:07] surpass it
[1:14:09] amen because easter made way to
[1:14:12] revelation 5
[1:14:14] and revelation 5 made way to revelation
[1:14:17] 10
[1:14:18] and all those fulfillment could never
[1:14:21] happen
[1:14:22] until the price was paid on calvary
[1:14:25] amen it took the price of calvary to go
[1:14:29] to revelation 5
[1:14:30] to provide the kinsman redeemer
[1:14:33] that can take the book and break the
[1:14:36] seal
[1:14:37] and go on revelation 10 and send it back
[1:14:40] on earth
[1:14:41] and now we are justified in the eyes of
[1:14:44] god
[1:14:46] like never done it before amen
[1:14:49] you say well the crucifixion was great
[1:14:52] but man has died many man has been
[1:14:55] crucified even the fifa the cross
[1:14:58] even the same days of our lord but there
[1:15:01] was only
[1:15:01] one of them who rose from the dead that
[1:15:05] sells it amen but all that
[1:15:08] is the rising he did what justify
[1:15:12] freely for ever living he loved me
[1:15:16] dying he saved me buried he carried my
[1:15:20] sin away
[1:15:21] but but but but
[1:15:25] but rising he justified me
[1:15:29] in other words you never done it for the
[1:15:32] first place
[1:15:34] you can stand and watch god face to face
[1:15:38] and not even being ashamed because we
[1:15:41] are justified by the blood of the lamb
[1:15:44] blessed be the name of the lord thank
[1:15:46] you jesus
[1:15:47] thank you for rising from the dead he's
[1:15:50] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:15:53] we praise him and we thank him thank you
[1:15:56] for this easter morning
[1:15:57] hallelujah what was that raising up
[1:16:02] it was god received that the bill has
[1:16:06] been wanted
[1:16:07] right thing he justified freely for
[1:16:11] oh what a savior rising what had god

[1:21:02] salon amen so you make sure you have a
[1:21:06] job
[1:21:07] like jacob you can work hard

[1:21:39] let's go to isaiah 3.
[1:21:43] i don't know where that one dropped but
[1:21:46] i had to deliver it
[1:21:48] isaiah 3 verse 8 could not touch it last
[1:21:52] week hopefully by the grace of god we
[1:21:54] can get there
[1:21:56] for jerusalem is ruined and judah is
[1:21:59] fallen
[1:22:00] because their tongue and their doings
[1:22:02] are against the lord to provoke the eyes
[1:22:04] of his glory
[1:22:06] verse 9 they show of their countenance
[1:22:10] their face does witness against them
[1:22:14] and they declare their sin as sodom
[1:22:17] they hide it not normally when a man
[1:22:21] does
[1:22:21] something wrong like adam when a child
[1:22:24] of god does something that is wrong
[1:22:27] he usually have a tendency to hide he
[1:22:30] has a tendency to run away from church
[1:22:32] he has a tendency to run away from his
[1:22:34] parent because he's hiding something
[1:22:37] that was proven by adam that's the
[1:22:39] reason why god was coming down and say
[1:22:41] adam adam where are they it's not that
[1:22:44] god didn't know where he was he's the
[1:22:46] god that knows everything
[1:22:48] but men have left the position that he
[1:22:51] used to hold
[1:22:52] when god look at that position it's
[1:22:54] empty
[1:22:55] man is no longer there amen but
[1:22:58] this sin of sodom is something that once
[1:23:02] he struck you
[1:23:04] once you under this anointing you are
[1:23:07] not ashamed to express your sin
[1:23:10] anymore it gives you a bold face
[1:23:14] while you're doing something wrong you
[1:23:16] are not ashamed anymore
[1:23:18] the sister that used to be shy is no
[1:23:20] longer shy
[1:23:22] her face is bright amen
[1:23:25] blessed be the name of the lord they
[1:23:27] hide it not
[1:23:28] word to their soul for they have
[1:23:30] rewarded evil
[1:23:32] to themselves verse 16 moreover the lord
[1:23:35] said because the daughters of
[1:23:37] zion are hardy proud and walk with
[1:23:41] straight forth neck
[1:23:42] what makes them walk like that what
[1:23:45] makes their neck
[1:23:46] stretch if god can give me grace you're
[1:23:48] going to see what high heel
[1:23:50] will do to your neck okay
[1:23:55] and one turn eyes in other words
[1:23:56] seductive eyes
[1:23:58] walking and mincing will make them
[1:24:01] tremble twist
[1:24:02] when they're walking can you walk
[1:24:04] normally and twist
[1:24:06] there is something that is making them
[1:24:08] twist you need a prophet to see this
[1:24:10] messing as they go and making a tinkling
[1:24:14] with their feet in other words as
[1:24:16] they're going there is a nose that
[1:24:18] followed them
[1:24:21] cut then everybody would turn around
[1:24:25] let's go to ezekiel 16 you might be
[1:24:27] seated
[1:24:29] if you're there you can say amen
[1:24:36] this is a channel that the black dog has
[1:24:38] been stirred
[1:24:40] so much and people had been
[1:24:44] delivered one after the other
[1:24:47] i cannot give this testimony here
[1:24:50] because it's people
[1:24:51] private life i gotta keep it i will go
[1:24:54] with that
[1:24:55] in the rapture amen bless it be the name
[1:24:59] of the lord it's going to stay here
[1:25:01] not even in the heart of my wife i go
[1:25:03] with it in the rapture
[1:25:05] because it's people on private life one
[1:25:08] after the other one two three almost
[1:25:11] every week somebody's getting delivered
[1:25:14] i'm preaching things i don't know it's
[1:25:16] going straight to people's life and pull
[1:25:18] something out
[1:25:19] amen it is the grace of god it has
[1:25:23] nothing to do with brother stephen it is
[1:25:25] your god
[1:25:26] amen verse 8 now when i pass by you
[1:25:30] in the time of puberty we explain this
[1:25:33] and look upon you
[1:25:35] behold your time was the time of love
[1:25:38] and i sprayed my skirt over you and
[1:25:41] cover your nakedness we already
[1:25:42] explained this
[1:25:43] uh claiming of the marriage
[1:25:47] yeah and i saw to you and enter into a
[1:25:50] covenant with you
[1:25:51] says the lord and you became mind the
[1:25:54] second stage we're looking right here
[1:25:56] is god not only is he claiming a
[1:25:58] relationship by spreading the skirt
[1:26:01] like roof but at this point he's now
[1:26:04] taking care
[1:26:05] of veiling or covering the woman that
[1:26:08] was naked
[1:26:09] amen she didn't have clothes first but
[1:26:12] now the lord is
[1:26:13] interested in her clothing first day she
[1:26:17] have to be washed
[1:26:18] she had to be clean they have to take
[1:26:20] the blood that came from my father
[1:26:22] the blood that we were born with from
[1:26:24] our families have to be completely
[1:26:26] cleaned out
[1:26:27] that life that we were born with from
[1:26:29] sex have to be completely removed
[1:26:32] you are born again but once you are born
[1:26:34] again god now is
[1:26:36] concerned about your other appearance he
[1:26:38] want to treat you
[1:26:39] and want to make you like his child
[1:26:41] everybody clear
[1:26:43] verse 14 if you can joke with me there
[1:26:46] the bible say
[1:26:46] and your renown your fame in other words
[1:26:50] went forth among the hidden not among
[1:26:54] the christians
[1:26:55] so this woman when she is outside among
[1:26:58] the women
[1:26:59] among the among the hidden in other
[1:27:02] words among the people
[1:27:03] of the world there is a perfume
[1:27:07] there is a fame there is a reputation
[1:27:10] that is spread in your community
[1:27:12] something happened to you god did
[1:27:15] something in your life
[1:27:16] that's a certain reputation came out and
[1:27:19] it's going
[1:27:20] among the hidden among the people that
[1:27:22] don't worship god the way you do
[1:27:25] amen we say and your renown went
[1:27:28] from among the hidden for your water
[1:27:32] so that beauty has been spoken of
[1:27:36] amen for it was perfect
[1:27:39] through my water calmliness
[1:27:42] which i had put upon you say the lord in
[1:27:46] other words
[1:27:47] what people are praising you for
[1:27:50] is not what you have done it is what i
[1:27:54] did for you it is the way i dress you
[1:27:57] the way i cover you the way i have
[1:28:01] adorned you
[1:28:02] the way i have protected you the way
[1:28:05] i have done i have transformed you amen
[1:28:09] that is what is causing the fame that
[1:28:12] family is not caused
[1:28:14] by you it is caused by the dress code of
[1:28:17] god
[1:28:19] amen hebrew chapter 11
[1:28:24] so we must strive to get that kind of
[1:28:28] dress code
[1:28:32] not what we want not what the world want
[1:28:36] but what god wanted
[1:28:39] hebrew chapter 11 we explained this
[1:28:42] last week a little verse 8 by faith
[1:28:46] abraham
[1:28:47] when he was called out into a place
[1:28:50] which he showed after received for
[1:28:52] an inheritance obeyed and he went out
[1:28:55] not knowing where he went
[1:28:56] everybody knows that now anybody clear
[1:28:59] by faith he's surgeon in the land of
[1:29:02] promise
[1:29:03] as in a strange country you understand
[1:29:06] that now
[1:29:07] because he has been called he goes into
[1:29:09] a land even though
[1:29:10] he is in the land of his inheritance but
[1:29:13] yet he's not comfortable
[1:29:16] but yet he's in a promised land he's
[1:29:18] living in a promised land
[1:29:19] as in a strange country dwelling in
[1:29:22] tabernacles with isaac
[1:29:24] and jacob the heir with him of the same
[1:29:27] promise in other words everybody
[1:29:29] that's going to be joined to the faith
[1:29:31] of abraham will have the same behavior
[1:29:34] you will live just like abraham you're
[1:29:36] not going to come
[1:29:37] join to the faith of abraham and live
[1:29:40] any different than what abraham was
[1:29:42] living
[1:29:42] everybody clear true faith also sarah
[1:29:46] now verse 10 for he look for a city
[1:29:50] which has foundations it's in the book
[1:29:53] of revelation
[1:29:54] who's builder and maker is who so
[1:29:57] abraham
[1:29:58] knew that everything that is in the
[1:30:00] world is not actually
[1:30:02] matching with with what he was looking
[1:30:05] he was looking for a city
[1:30:07] that's the builder the founder of the
[1:30:09] city is god
[1:30:11] but that city is not in this kingdom
[1:30:14] that's why jesus said my kingdom is not
[1:30:17] of this world
[1:30:18] everybody clear job to verse 13
[1:30:22] these all died in faith not having
[1:30:25] received the promise
[1:30:27] but have seen them afar off and were
[1:30:30] persuaded of them
[1:30:31] and embraced them and confessed that
[1:30:34] they were strangers
[1:30:35] and what pilgrim on the earth how can
[1:30:38] you be a stranger and a pilgrim on a
[1:30:40] promised land
[1:30:42] it means that that's not satisfaction
[1:30:45] that just
[1:30:45] take you to the baptism of the holy
[1:30:47] spirit then
[1:30:49] the black dog is stirred then the fight
[1:30:51] started
[1:30:52] right when israel drunk from the water
[1:30:54] of rephrasing then amalek
[1:30:56] attack amalek will never attack if you
[1:30:59] have not
[1:31:00] drunk from the water of raphael yet
[1:31:02] because you belong to him
[1:31:04] you are working for his kingdom when you
[1:31:06] change the kingdom by the inner man
[1:31:08] then automatically a fight started
[1:31:11] that's what the indian
[1:31:12] uh chief said to brother branham that
[1:31:14] since i've been saved there is a battle
[1:31:16] that started there was a white dog
[1:31:18] and a black dog fighting let's go to
[1:31:20] verse 14.
[1:31:21] for they does say such things declare
[1:31:25] plainly that they seek a country in
[1:31:27] other words by
[1:31:28] living like that you are testifying to
[1:31:31] the world
[1:31:31] that i don't belong to you amen this
[1:31:34] world is not our home
[1:31:36] this is satan eden this is not our place
[1:31:39] that's the reason why i'm living
[1:31:40] different than you people
[1:31:42] amen verse 15 and truly
[1:31:45] if they had been mindful of that country
[1:31:49] this is where
[1:31:50] we want to really get it in other words
[1:31:52] when abraham
[1:31:53] left we explained to you he left for the
[1:31:55] land of the calvins he left from babylon
[1:31:58] he left for the land of the gardens from
[1:32:00] babylon everybody clear
[1:32:02] but the problem is when he left you must
[1:32:05] forget that land
[1:32:07] this is what a holla and a holy bar in
[1:32:09] ezekiel 23
[1:32:11] did not do they didn't burn the bridges
[1:32:13] and they went back again to
[1:32:15] babylon but that's what paul is saying
[1:32:17] that
[1:32:18] when the people when they departed from
[1:32:20] the land and went to the promised land
[1:32:23] they never again look back
[1:32:26] to the land of the county their life
[1:32:29] became
[1:32:29] different their jurisdiction was
[1:32:32] completely different
[1:32:33] the headship was completely different
[1:32:36] but they never
[1:32:37] kept in their mind the image of the land
[1:32:40] of the county
[1:32:41] because that image will pull you back
[1:32:44] from where you came from
[1:32:46] amen verse 15 and truly if they had been
[1:32:50] mindful if they were thinking of that
[1:32:53] country
[1:32:54] from where they came out they might have
[1:32:58] had opportunity to have what return
[1:33:01] as long as you thinking on the world
[1:33:05] as long as you love the world and the
[1:33:08] things of the world
[1:33:10] from where god pulls you out you're
[1:33:13] gonna have a tendency
[1:33:15] to go back again amen in other words you
[1:33:18] are barking at the wrong door
[1:33:20] you are inviting the black dog back
[1:33:23] again
[1:33:24] to pull you from where god took you out
[1:33:26] so once you leave the world
[1:33:28] once you leave egypt you must burn your
[1:33:31] bridges because
[1:33:32] you don't want to go there in egypt
[1:33:35] in babylon you are living like hidden
[1:33:38] you didn't know god
[1:33:40] you are living worldly everybody clear
[1:33:43] amen but for your reputation to go among
[1:33:46] the hidden
[1:33:47] you must be in the promised land when
[1:33:50] you live in the promised land then your
[1:33:52] life
[1:33:53] and the way you dress the way you
[1:33:55] portray the way you live
[1:33:56] everything you're doing is completely
[1:33:59] contrary
[1:34:00] to where you came from that's why people
[1:34:02] begin to talk about you
[1:34:04] different like something really happened
[1:34:06] to that person
[1:34:08] but if your heart is like israel
[1:34:11] on the journey to the promised land keep
[1:34:13] thinking about the concumber
[1:34:15] of egypt keep thinking about whatever
[1:34:18] they ate in egypt and things like that
[1:34:20] god finally destroyed them all because
[1:34:23] they were not fit
[1:34:24] to enter in the promised land with a
[1:34:26] polluted mind
[1:34:27] amen let's pray heavenly father
[1:34:30] lord we thank you again in this easter
[1:34:33] morning
[1:34:34] where we are celebrating the great
[1:34:36] resurrection lord
[1:34:38] that sealed the history of christianity
[1:34:41] father thank you for coming down this
[1:34:44] undying love
[1:34:45] that you expressed for us lord to come
[1:34:48] and to climb
[1:34:49] all the way to calvary to take the place
[1:34:51] of us
[1:34:52] sinners lord being lord father strip off
[1:34:55] your clothes completely
[1:34:57] in front of everybody just because you
[1:35:00] wanted lord
[1:35:01] to pay our ticket father we are so
[1:35:04] grateful for that we thank you
[1:35:06] and we are committing this service again
[1:35:08] unto the hand this morning
[1:35:09] lord may you move me completely out of

[1:35:45] amen god bless you turn with me to
[1:35:48] genesis
[1:35:49] chapter 2
[1:35:53] 1 verse 26 when you're there you can
[1:35:57] holler
[1:35:57] amen then we can go somebody goes quick
[1:36:02] we on the king's uh hazaris three feast
[1:36:05] and esther two banquet we on part 25
[1:36:09] where we're dealing with the territory
[1:36:12] of the
[1:36:13] black dog everybody there now when we
[1:36:16] spoke
[1:36:17] on ezekiel 23 on our holy bar
[1:36:21] we found out that al-holibah opened a
[1:36:23] door
[1:36:24] to the people of the outside she was
[1:36:27] rescued from egypt
[1:36:28] she was rescued from the world she came
[1:36:32] out from denomination
[1:36:33] all the way to the promised land but she
[1:36:36] never
[1:36:36] burned the bridges behind her and she
[1:36:39] continued to think over it
[1:36:41] and open the door to something else in
[1:36:44] ezekiel 23 verse 36
[1:36:46] and verse 40 and 42 the bible says
[1:36:50] and furthermore that she have sent for
[1:36:53] men
[1:36:54] to come from pharah unto whom a
[1:36:57] messenger
[1:36:58] was sent and lo we already explained
[1:37:01] this they came
[1:37:02] for whom you did wash the themselves
[1:37:06] and pentest their eyes and deck their
[1:37:09] self
[1:37:10] with ornament when these women
[1:37:13] came to the promised land they used to
[1:37:16] dress
[1:37:17] a certain way they used to behave
[1:37:20] a certain way they used to live a
[1:37:23] certain way
[1:37:24] but when they opened the door to the
[1:37:26] babylonian
[1:37:28] when they opened the door to the garden
[1:37:31] when they opened the door to go back
[1:37:33] again to the old lives
[1:37:35] that they were leaving before by opening
[1:37:39] that door he also opened the door
[1:37:42] to worthiness everybody clear he opened
[1:37:45] the door
[1:37:46] to worldiness and they never realized
[1:37:49] what they were doing everybody cleared
[1:37:51] so far
[1:37:52] so when they opened the door to
[1:37:54] worldliness and begin to court
[1:37:56] the young men that were not the young
[1:37:58] men of israel
[1:38:00] the bible says that they washed their
[1:38:02] self not that they were not taken aback
[1:38:04] they were washing themselves they were
[1:38:06] taking bath but
[1:38:08] what the bible was trying to explain
[1:38:09] here that there is a
[1:38:11] different uh uh personal care
[1:38:16] there is a difference in their approach
[1:38:19] of their grooming that was different
[1:38:22] than the way they were doing before
[1:38:24] in other words for the first time these
[1:38:27] women
[1:38:28] begin to paint their eyes here
[1:38:31] they begin to deck themselves with a
[1:38:34] certain
[1:38:34] ornament and the reason why they did
[1:38:37] that
[1:38:37] they didn't do that to go into the into
[1:38:40] the church
[1:38:41] they didn't do that to go into the
[1:38:43] temple but they did it because they were
[1:38:45] expecting
[1:38:47] man to come and to live uncleanly with
[1:38:50] them everybody clear
[1:38:51] so the first thing the scripture says
[1:38:54] there is the painting of the eyes
[1:38:59] and then the second one the decking with
[1:39:02] ornament
[1:39:04] everybody clear so far now when you look
[1:39:07] at the painting of the eyes
[1:39:10] brother branham says this that this is
[1:39:12] the major scene of our days
[1:39:15] it is the major scene among our people
[1:39:17] which is water
[1:39:19] worldliness as the bible say laodicea
[1:39:22] is what worldly so since we're dealing
[1:39:25] with worldliness in proverbs chapter 6
[1:39:28] if you recall this very well the bible
[1:39:31] strictly explained to us that you must
[1:39:34] be careful
[1:39:35] about a strange woman because she's
[1:39:37] sweet with her world
[1:39:39] but she also said juice with her eyes
[1:39:42] when you open
[1:39:43] the eyes of your of a woman let's go to
[1:39:46] proverbs chapter 6 first
[1:39:47] so it can make sense somebody else is
[1:39:50] still thinking
[1:39:51] remembering what was in proverbs chapter
[1:39:54] 6.
[1:39:56] so let's get it and pick you up so we
[1:39:59] can move forward
[1:40:00] proverbs chapter 6 verse 24 if you dare
[1:40:04] you can say amen
[1:40:06] a few people
[1:40:09] 24 few people
[1:40:15] need to preach with me
[1:40:19] 24. okay proverbs 6 24 to keep you from
[1:40:23] the evil woman
[1:40:25] that woman is not a good woman she is
[1:40:28] evil
[1:40:30] from the flattery of the tongue of a
[1:40:32] strange woman
[1:40:33] she's covering herself
[1:40:37] with flattery she's appearing to be
[1:40:39] sweet
[1:40:40] but she's not really sweet you won't see
[1:40:42] that color
[1:40:43] until you put her in your home then
[1:40:46] you're going to see her color
[1:40:48] last we explain to you the word lust
[1:40:52] everybody clear we explain to you that
[1:40:54] there is something that a woman can do
[1:40:56] to cause
[1:40:57] lust somebody can remind me number one
[1:41:00] she must
[1:41:01] expose herself
[1:41:04] she must expose part of her body
[1:41:08] because a woman body is sacred number
[1:41:11] two
[1:41:12] she cannot be exposing part of her body
[1:41:16] but she can wear something that is tight
[1:41:19] everybody clear and that is showing the
[1:41:22] form
[1:41:23] and the shape of her body in other words
[1:41:25] this is what you hear people say
[1:41:27] that you look sexy everybody clear
[1:41:31] and the third thing that we spoke with
[1:41:33] when the woman
[1:41:35] wear high heel
[1:41:38] because i here give a woman a temporary
[1:41:42] shape that she doesn't have i'm going to
[1:41:44] show you and demonstrate
[1:41:46] that to you by the scripture and by the
[1:41:49] chart
[1:41:49] and by the message of the hour anybody
[1:41:52] clear
[1:41:53] so he said last night after her what
[1:41:56] beauty this beauty is not the beauty
[1:41:59] of a good woman it is a beauty of
[1:42:03] an evil woman and we found out that when
[1:42:06] our oliver
[1:42:07] begin to cut the boys from the
[1:42:10] babylonian empire
[1:42:11] she changed her way of presenting
[1:42:14] herself
[1:42:15] before the people she begin to put more
[1:42:18] artificial upon her natural beauty
[1:42:22] in order to attract the man from another
[1:42:25] kingdom
[1:42:25] everybody clear last note after her
[1:42:28] beauty
[1:42:29] in your heart neither
[1:42:32] let her take you with her water with her
[1:42:35] eyelids in another translation those
[1:42:38] eyelids
[1:42:40] are called eyelashes
[1:42:43] everybody clear how can an eyelash of a
[1:42:46] woman
[1:42:47] attract you anybody clear
[1:42:50] when you look at this picture here this
[1:42:52] is an image
[1:42:53] of a eye of a woman there is two
[1:42:56] arrows right here this part on the top
[1:42:59] here
[1:42:59] is your eyelid anybody follow me
[1:43:03] then the hair that is all around there
[1:43:05] that's what we call
[1:43:06] the eye lashes amen but with technology
[1:43:11] and everything that happened today
[1:43:13] a woman can change this natural
[1:43:16] looking eye into something that looked
[1:43:19] like that
[1:43:20] anybody clear if you look at this eye is
[1:43:23] more
[1:43:24] brighter than the first one amen
[1:43:27] if you look at the eyelashes they are
[1:43:30] longer
[1:43:31] because a woman has put on eyelashes
[1:43:34] extension that's what you see women with
[1:43:37] long eyelashes
[1:43:38] that are not natural they're not doing
[1:43:41] that by any chances
[1:43:43] they're doing that because there is a
[1:43:45] power in the eye
[1:43:47] of a woman ever clear and if you look
[1:43:49] from a natural look of a woman
[1:43:52] on top right here there is a paint that
[1:43:54] has been painted
[1:43:56] in the eye so a holla and a holly bar
[1:44:00] move from the natural look of a woman
[1:44:03] into an artificial look of the woman
[1:44:07] in preparation to meet babylonian men
[1:44:12] in preparation to meet the people of the
[1:44:15] world
[1:44:16] you must go into the world and please
[1:44:19] them in other words they are not
[1:44:21] attracted by a natural woman
[1:44:23] they need to be attracted with a woman
[1:44:26] that is putting a lot of stuff on
[1:44:27] herself
[1:44:28] everybody clear so far brother branham
[1:44:31] say
[1:44:31] i am told that a snake
[1:44:35] can catch the eye of a bird
[1:44:38] and charm that bird with its
[1:44:42] enchantment and the stare of
[1:44:45] its water that's why brother branham
[1:44:48] referred
[1:44:49] many times that the eye of a woman that
[1:44:53] has been
[1:44:53] painted looked like a lizard
[1:44:57] and brother branham said that when he
[1:44:59] went into hell
[1:45:01] he's seen women with the painting of the
[1:45:04] eyes
[1:45:05] in other words the painting of the eyes
[1:45:08] originated from hell
[1:45:10] that's why when he went to jesse penny
[1:45:12] he saw the same thing that he saw in
[1:45:15] hell
[1:45:16] and brother branham said now hell is on
[1:45:18] earth
[1:45:19] in other words the influence of hell has
[1:45:22] been deposited
[1:45:24] onto the people and the people are
[1:45:27] manifesting not heaven
[1:45:29] but they are manifesting hell in vision
[1:45:33] everybody clear so far brother random
[1:45:35] say with its enchantment
[1:45:38] and the stare of his eyes until such a
[1:45:41] way
[1:45:42] if that bird will give the snake its
[1:45:45] water
[1:45:46] if you can only focus on the eyes of
[1:45:50] a woman that have changed her natural
[1:45:53] work
[1:45:54] into an artificial look if you look at
[1:45:58] hollywood they even have a tendency to
[1:46:01] change
[1:46:01] even the color of the eyes the eyes that
[1:46:05] you see on the picture of beyonce
[1:46:08] it is not the natural beyonce it is a
[1:46:11] beyonce that has been worked on
[1:46:14] because picture must be taken and put on
[1:46:17] the television
[1:46:18] to seduce men anybody clear
[1:46:22] if that bird will give the snake its
[1:46:25] attention
[1:46:26] for just a few minutes not an hour
[1:46:28] brother
[1:46:29] young brother just a few minutes you'd
[1:46:31] gone
[1:46:33] that bird will flutter and completely
[1:46:36] become water
[1:46:38] that's why you find yourself in trouble
[1:46:41] by staring at the wrong thing and the
[1:46:43] snake will take the bird
[1:46:46] brother branham say i can believe that
[1:46:49] because i know another water
[1:46:52] the old serpent the devil that if he can
[1:46:56] ever catch the eye with his enchantment
[1:47:00] with your modern rock and roll and all
[1:47:03] your fenders
[1:47:04] of the world if he can ever catch you
[1:47:07] young lady
[1:47:08] or young man just long enough
[1:47:11] to get his charm in you you shall
[1:47:14] flatter
[1:47:15] but you can't get loose he shall hold
[1:47:18] you
[1:47:18] until he swallow you up in water
[1:47:22] so it is an instrument that satan has
[1:47:26] used
[1:47:26] all along is to take a woman that is
[1:47:30] natural
[1:47:31] and to add an artificial something upon
[1:47:34] the woman
[1:47:35] in order to make the son of god to fail
[1:47:39] everybody clear the only way i am told
[1:47:42] that that little bird ever has a chance
[1:47:45] is to get his eyes watered
[1:47:48] off of the serpent and he cannot
[1:47:51] look at anything else because he stands
[1:47:54] staring
[1:47:55] but if he shall take his eyes from the
[1:47:58] serpent
[1:47:59] and look upward toward god and flatter
[1:48:02] his wings
[1:48:03] he shall flam plumb out of the rich of
[1:48:06] the word
[1:48:06] snake that's the reason why when you see
[1:48:09] something immoral
[1:48:10] you cannot focus on it you order
[1:48:13] medically if you are born with the
[1:48:15] spirit of god
[1:48:16] there is inside white dog will direct
[1:48:20] you away from it completely
[1:48:22] because it's meant to catch your
[1:48:24] attention
[1:48:25] and to draw you down a man that is
[1:48:28] filled with the holy spirit
[1:48:30] you cannot help to see a woman
[1:48:33] you cannot help to see a woman ill dress
[1:48:35] up there they're doing it
[1:48:37] you are not responsible for it but when
[1:48:39] you see something wrong
[1:48:41] automatically the holy ghost will take
[1:48:44] your head and move it away
[1:48:46] because the holy ghost knows that if you
[1:48:48] stare
[1:48:49] too long on that woman you're gonna
[1:48:52] flatter yourself
[1:48:53] and find yourself in trouble everybody
[1:48:55] clear so far
[1:48:57] blessed be the name of the lord so as we
[1:49:00] continue here
[1:49:01] brother branham the bible says this in
[1:49:04] psalm 139
[1:49:05] this is what we expressed last week that
[1:49:08] for that has possessed my reign
[1:49:11] and that has covered me in my mother's
[1:49:13] womb i will praise thee
[1:49:15] for i am fearfully and wonderfully
[1:49:18] made everybody understand this now the
[1:49:21] reason why we went
[1:49:23] back to this principle is for you to
[1:49:26] understand
[1:49:26] that the natural way god created you
[1:49:30] is exactly beautiful in the eyes of god
[1:49:35] you must be proud of it you must cherish
[1:49:39] it
[1:49:39] you must take care of it and you cannot
[1:49:42] leave
[1:49:43] building complexes anything
[1:49:46] that will destroy the original image of
[1:49:49] god is something that is wrong
[1:49:52] david says for i am fearfully
[1:49:56] and wonderfully made marvelous art that
[1:49:59] works
[1:50:00] and that my soul know it right well you
[1:50:02] need to know that
[1:50:03] my substance was not hid from thee when
[1:50:06] i was made in secret
[1:50:08] and curiously wrote in the lowest part
[1:50:11] of the earth
[1:50:12] then i did see my substance god saw you
[1:50:15] yet being on perfect and in that book
[1:50:20] all my members were written which
[1:50:22] incontinence were fashioned
[1:50:24] when as yet there was none of them in
[1:50:27] other words god
[1:50:28] has an image of you before even you were
[1:50:30] born
[1:50:31] how precious also are that thoughts and
[1:50:34] to me oh god
[1:50:35] how great is the sum of what all of them
[1:50:38] everybody cleared so far now we continue
[1:50:41] on isaiah here
[1:50:43] the bible says that but now that says
[1:50:46] the lord that created
[1:50:47] you because last week we found the
[1:50:50] principle
[1:50:50] of variety that he is the god of variety
[1:50:54] he's the god that makes some white some
[1:50:57] dark
[1:50:58] some light some blue it is his own
[1:51:00] prerogative
[1:51:01] and the reason why he did it he did it
[1:51:04] for his own pleasure
[1:51:06] and he did it for his own purpose and he
[1:51:10] did
[1:51:10] you unique as you are and there is
[1:51:13] nobody
[1:51:14] that can fit you or take your place now
[1:51:16] tonight
[1:51:17] now this morning we're going to add this
[1:51:19] now he said but now
[1:51:22] that saved the lord that created the o
[1:51:24] who
[1:51:26] jacob and he that formed thee oh
[1:51:30] if you look this one was a supplanter
[1:51:32] but this one was a redeem one
[1:51:35] you understand that this one was still
[1:51:38] stealing and doing all kind of stuff
[1:51:40] but this one was the one that was
[1:51:42] redeemed that got the mark of redemption
[1:51:45] oh israel fear not for i have worked
[1:51:49] because israel speaks about the
[1:51:51] redemptive name
[1:51:52] everybody clear i have called thee by
[1:51:55] name
[1:51:56] the earth mind god cleans you he's the
[1:51:59] one that went into cavalry
[1:52:01] he's the one that paid the price he paid
[1:52:04] the price of your debt
[1:52:05] you owe your life unto him that's why
[1:52:08] he's claiming you
[1:52:09] when the pastors through the waters
[1:52:13] i will be with thee and through the
[1:52:16] rivers
[1:52:17] they shall not overflow them the reason
[1:52:20] why the river are not overflowing you
[1:52:23] is not because you are strong the river
[1:52:26] are not
[1:52:27] overflowing you because god is with you
[1:52:31] amen it is god that is blocking the
[1:52:35] river
[1:52:36] the river are afraid of god
[1:52:39] they are not afraid of you when israel
[1:52:42] was going through the red sea
[1:52:44] he was the pillar of fire that looked at
[1:52:47] the red sea
[1:52:48] and the red sea opened up and israel
[1:52:51] went ahead
[1:52:52] when they were first derived from jordan
[1:52:54] it was
[1:52:55] still god that opened the jordan river
[1:52:58] that's why
[1:52:58] israel passed that's why he said i will
[1:53:01] be with you
[1:53:02] in other words no matter what temptation
[1:53:05] you're gonna go
[1:53:06] just remember though i walk through the
[1:53:09] valley
[1:53:09] of the shadow of death i will be with
[1:53:13] you
[1:53:13] my staff and my road they will comfort
[1:53:16] you
[1:53:17] god is always on time i will never leave
[1:53:21] you nor forsake you
[1:53:23] no matter how dark it is just remember
[1:53:26] i won't be there hallelujah
[1:53:29] blessed be the name of the lord they
[1:53:32] shall not
[1:53:33] overflow them when they are walking
[1:53:36] through water
[1:53:38] shadrach meshach abednego
[1:53:42] that shall not be what why because the
[1:53:45] fourth men
[1:53:46] enter into the fire ever clear that
[1:53:49] shall not be burned
[1:53:51] neither shall the fame clean cleaner
[1:53:53] upon
[1:53:54] thee why because i will be with you
[1:53:58] verse 4 since that was precious
[1:54:03] in my sight so the way
[1:54:07] god created you when god
[1:54:10] look at you you are precious in his eyes
[1:54:15] hallelujah since that was

[2:00:38] problem with you healing the people
[2:00:40] you can heal all the people we love the
[2:00:42] benefit

[2:00:47] that you being a water
[2:00:51] jesus was 100 men
[2:00:54] yet 100 god because he was god in flesh
[2:01:00] you being a man just like me and you

[2:01:48] god came and the scripture cannot be
[2:01:51] broken
[2:01:52] say you of him whom the father has
[2:01:55] sanctified
[2:01:56] and send into the world you blaspheme

[2:02:03] trying to
[2:02:04] kill me you call the prophet gods
[2:02:08] and when i came i say i am the son of
[2:02:11] god
[2:02:12] you are trying to kill me go now to
[2:02:15] verse five
[2:02:16] chapter 5 let's see what the son of god
[2:02:19] means
[2:02:21] you there verse 18
[2:02:24] john 5 18 therefore the jews
[2:02:28] sought them out to do what to kill him
[2:02:31] because he not only had broken the
[2:02:34] sabbath
[2:02:35] but said also that god was what
[2:02:39] in other words god was his father
[2:02:42] i am the son of god

[2:02:49] water equal with who
[2:02:52] a son of god means god
[2:02:57] and you are sons and daughters of god

[2:03:04] and when lucifer came to jesus
[2:03:07] he said if that be the son of god
[2:03:11] turn this water stone into water
[2:03:16] in other words a son of god have a power
[2:03:20] to turn a stone into bread
[2:03:23] a son of god have a power to create
[2:03:27] things
[2:03:30] oh my god let's go back now
[2:03:34] you are gods and all of you
[2:03:37] are children of the most high god
[2:03:40] he created you for his glory
[2:03:44] john chapter 1 verse 12 but as many
[2:03:47] as received him to them
[2:03:50] gave he water power to become waters
[2:03:55] even to them that believe
[2:03:57] on his which way
[2:04:02] not of blood not your natural birth
[2:04:06] not of the will of the flesh no
[2:04:10] of the will of men but born
[2:04:13] of what you are birthed by
[2:04:16] god and it's broad birth
[2:04:20] something what he brought is exactly
[2:04:23] like him
[2:04:24] [Applause]
[2:04:28] hallelujah and the word was
[2:04:31] made flesh and dwelt among us
[2:04:36] and we behead his word in
[2:04:39] isaiah 43 he says i have created you for
[2:04:43] mine
[2:04:46] hallelujah we behead his glory
[2:04:51] their glory as of their only water
[2:04:55] begotten of the father so when jesus
[2:04:59] came
[2:05:00] jesus was reflecting the glory of god
[2:05:06] john chapter 17 verse four and five
[2:05:10] i have glorified thee on the earth
[2:05:14] i have finished the work which that gave
[2:05:16] us me to do
[2:05:17] and now oh what do what

[2:05:25] thy own self with the
[2:05:29] which i had with thee before the world
[2:05:33] in the beginning was the word and the
[2:05:37] word was with god
[2:05:39] and the word was the glory that i was
[2:05:43] with you at the beginning
[2:05:45] father give me the glory and let that
[2:05:49] glory
[2:05:49] be manifested and god have created you
[2:05:53] and me
[2:05:54] for his glory
[2:05:56] [Applause]
[2:05:58] [Music]
[2:06:00] if christ have a glory where do we get
[2:06:03] our glory
[2:06:06] john chapter 17 verse
[2:06:09] 22 amen and the glory which
[2:06:14] died

[2:06:19] which
[2:06:20] that gave us me i have done what
[2:06:25] that they may be even as we
[2:06:28] are so that glory that was in christ
[2:06:32] has also been poured into the church
[2:06:36] because all that was in god was poor in
[2:06:40] christ
[2:06:41] and all that was in christ was boy into
[2:06:44] the
[2:06:45] church i have created you to display

[2:07:39] you
[2:07:40] is to explain to you that i created you
[2:07:43] the way you

[2:08:57] hallelujah when people see you
[2:09:00] they must glorify god that's why paul
[2:09:03] said we
[2:09:04] are written epistle when somebody look
[2:09:06] at you
[2:09:07] they say god we praise you we praise you
[2:09:10] for that man
[2:09:11] we praise you for a honest boy we praise
[2:09:13] you for a honest man
[2:09:15] we praise you for a honest girl we
[2:09:17] praise you for a honest employee
[2:09:19] she's polite she's good she's always on
[2:09:22] time

[2:09:25] like anybody else
[2:09:26] you glorify god with your life
[2:09:30] amen blessed be the name of the lord
[2:09:34] ephesians 2 verse 10 for we are his
[2:09:38] water
[2:09:39] we are his masterpiece created in christ
[2:09:44] jesus unto what
[2:09:48] so you are created marvelously
[2:09:51] wonderfully made
[2:09:53] unique for a purpose for god's own
[2:09:56] pleasure
[2:09:57] for his glory to do what to bring good
[2:10:00] works
[2:10:03] to bring good works we are his
[2:10:05] workmanship
[2:10:07] created in christ jesus unto good
[2:10:10] works which god has before or then
[2:10:14] that we should do what you don't have to
[2:10:17] manufacture
[2:10:19] work god have
[2:10:22] certain things that he put on his agenda
[2:10:27] and he said i have one two three four
[2:10:30] for brother hamilton so when he's
[2:10:33] creating brad hamilton
[2:10:36] he's designing him carefully
[2:10:39] wonderfully masterfully unique
[2:10:43] to match the agenda the personal
[2:10:46] agenda he has for brother
[2:10:50] hamilton are you there so when
[2:10:53] brother hamilton is redeemed by god
[2:10:57] he needs to put his car in new job
[2:11:00] and let the holy spirit begin to take
[2:11:03] the agenda
[2:11:04] and manifest that in his life
[2:11:07] i do nothing except what the father
[2:11:11] shows me i don't grow beyond my agenda
[2:11:16] are you there i am doing nothing except
[2:11:19] what the agenda is telling me that's why
[2:11:23] when they asked him when are you coming
[2:11:26] jesus look at the agenda
[2:11:28] he said according to the ministry of the
[2:11:30] sun
[2:11:31] the agenda saying the sun cannot
[2:11:34] disclose the day of the rupture
[2:11:36] i cannot tell you wait when i go to my
[2:11:38] father
[2:11:39] that's when i will do that but under
[2:11:42] this agenda
[2:11:43] it is not written so i cannot go beyond
[2:11:46] the agenda
[2:11:47] so when you are not glorifying god
[2:11:51] in your body you actually blocking his
[2:11:54] agenda
[2:12:00] hallelujah romans 12 verse 1
[2:12:04] i beseech you therefore brethren by the
[2:12:06] mercies of god
[2:12:08] that he presents your what why is paul
[2:12:12] insisting on the body
[2:12:14] sister why is paul insisting of the body
[2:12:18] because your body can give a different
[2:12:20] signal
[2:12:22] is that signal glorifying god
[2:12:25] are you there present your body
[2:12:28] a living water sacrifice that is what
[2:12:33] and what so the way you present yourself
[2:12:38] must be acceptable by god
[2:12:42] the way you present yourself must
[2:12:46] express holiness the way you express
[2:12:50] yourself
[2:12:51] cannot turn the spirit of lust upon
[2:12:54] someone
[2:12:56] because lust is not holiness
[2:12:59] everybody present your body
[2:13:03] a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto
[2:13:07] god
[2:13:07] which is a reasonable surface
[2:13:11] and be not confirmed to this water
[2:13:16] what is the world to me you came out of
[2:13:20] gaudy you came out of babylon
[2:13:23] you came out of egypt you came out of
[2:13:26] the hidden
[2:13:27] when you are in the promised land do not
[2:13:31] be conformed again to where you come
[2:13:34] from
[2:13:36] because we are in the world but we are
[2:13:40] not
[2:13:40] of the world because we have been with
[2:13:43] him out
[2:13:44] yet we're still living in the world but
[2:13:47] be not conformed with the world
[2:13:52] everybody clear but be
[2:13:55] transformed by the renewing of your man
[2:13:59] that he may prove what is good
[2:14:03] and what and what perfect will of who
[2:14:08] blessed be the name of the lord world
[2:14:12] don't act like the world you must have a
[2:14:16] fame
[2:14:17] among the hidden but do not copy
[2:14:20] them don't act like the hidden
[2:14:24] the unbelievers don't yourself with them
[2:14:28] come out from among them don't be this
[2:14:31] way
[2:14:32] if you love the world or the things of
[2:14:35] the world
[2:14:36] the what
[2:14:42] i'm dropping now slowly into the channel
[2:14:46] the fashion the word comes from the
[2:14:49] greek word cosmos
[2:14:51] which means the water that's why paul
[2:14:55] said
[2:14:55] be not conformed to the world
[2:15:00] be not conformed to the fashion
[2:15:03] of the world because the fashion
[2:15:06] of the world are driven by lucifer
[2:15:10] to glorify lucifer to express
[2:15:14] hell on earth have and also want to
[2:15:18] express
[2:15:19] on earth
[2:15:22] which means the fashion of the world if
[2:15:25] you love the world
[2:15:26] and the things of the world the love of
[2:15:28] god is not even in you yet
[2:15:31] you have never been water you still have
[2:15:34] a black dog on your soul
[2:15:37] now the word there is not earth the word
[2:15:40] there
[2:15:41] is not earth it's a greek word is cosmos
[2:15:44] which means the water
[2:15:46] the world order if we love the fashion
[2:15:49] of
[2:15:50] the earth the world
[2:15:53] if we love the weather the trend
[2:15:57] of the day are you following me
[2:16:01] there is a reason why certain things
[2:16:05] are popular in a certain time
[2:16:09] are you there they might be popular two
[2:16:12] years ago and they are not popular today
[2:16:16] lucifer is driving his agenda
[2:16:19] and paul is saying be careful when you
[2:16:23] see
[2:16:23] something popular amongst the people
[2:16:26] don't get sucked up quickly
[2:16:30] because you might be glorifying the
[2:16:33] devil
[2:16:37] unconsciously are you there
[2:16:41] why are men living bird beard
[2:16:44] all around they use not
[2:16:48] why is everybody doing that why is
[2:16:50] everybody having hair they don't want to
[2:16:52] calm down
[2:16:57] why they didn't have it five years ago
[2:17:00] why when he started by a hip-hop star he
[2:17:03] goes all around
[2:17:05] what trigger that hip hop star what
[2:17:08] trigger that rock and roll man to
[2:17:11] dress himself a certain way and the
[2:17:15] entire country
[2:17:17] all the way to africa everybody
[2:17:20] is on page
[2:17:24] since when a yellow hair
[2:17:28] looks good on a woman since when
[2:17:31] a pink hair looked good on a woman
[2:17:35] but after a while women begin to put
[2:17:37] blue hair
[2:17:39] and if you don't understand what lucifer
[2:17:42] is doing
[2:17:43] you can get sucked because everybody's
[2:17:47] doing that
[2:17:48] and you begin to worship the devil
[2:17:56] if we love that trend of the day
[2:18:01] leave your build because you want to
[2:18:04] live it
[2:18:05] but don't leave it because everybody's
[2:18:08] living it
[2:18:09] because you don't know what everybody's
[2:18:11] doing
[2:18:13] are you following me
[2:18:16] don't catch your hair like everybody
[2:18:19] because you don't know what it means
[2:18:24] if we think this is a wonderful time
[2:18:28] oh we have all these things if you think
[2:18:31] that
[2:18:31] it's because your thinking is wrong
[2:18:34] it is perverted by the devil for if we
[2:18:38] love the world and the things of this
[2:18:40] present
[2:18:41] world they're not going to judge you for
[2:18:44] philadelphia
[2:18:45] they are judging you for this time amen
[2:18:49] it is because the love of god is not
[2:18:52] even in you
[2:18:53] remember that oh god look what we are
[2:18:57] looking into
[2:18:59] what are you copying
[2:19:03] amen hallelujah my god
[2:19:07] let's go now to genesis and let's drive
[2:19:11] this one
[2:19:12] let's go to genesis chapter 3 praise
[2:19:15] the name of the lord now we in the
[2:19:19] channel
[2:19:20] if you're there you can say amen
[2:19:24] genesis chapter 3 verse 4
[2:19:29] and the serpent said to the woman you
[2:19:32] shall not surely water
[2:19:35] so who's a liar he's making god a liar
[2:19:39] god said you shall die and the serpent
[2:19:43] said you shall not die
[2:19:45] hebrew chapter 6 verse 18.
[2:19:48] that by two immutable things come
[2:19:51] up in which it was
[2:19:56] can you read that impossible for god to
[2:19:59] do what
[2:20:05] we might have a strong consolation
[2:20:09] who have fled for refuge to lay hold
[2:20:12] upon the hope set beside us
[2:20:14] before us that's why when god gives you
[2:20:17] a promise
[2:20:18] it must happen because god cannot lie
[2:20:22] here is something that is impossible to
[2:20:24] god
[2:20:25] god cannot lie
[2:20:29] titus 1 verse 2 in hope of
[2:20:32] eternal life which god karma
[2:20:35] that cannot number 23 19
[2:20:40] god is not a man that he should watch
[2:20:45] how dare lucifer you can say that
[2:20:48] you shall should not surely die let's go
[2:20:51] back to verse four
[2:20:53] and the serpent said to the woman you
[2:20:56] shall not surely die
[2:20:58] for god knows that the day you eat
[2:21:01] thereof then your eyes shall be
[2:21:04] opened and you shall be as what
[2:21:08] in psalm 83 there is a credit to
[2:21:12] there is a congregation of the mahdi
[2:21:15] those mighty are gods they are the
[2:21:18] children of god
[2:21:19] because the children of god are gods
[2:21:23] and in genesis 1 26 man was created in
[2:21:28] the
[2:21:28] image and the likeness of
[2:21:32] god adam and eve were already god
[2:21:37] [Applause]
[2:21:39] but lucifer want to give them another
[2:21:42] deity how can you make me god when i'm
[2:21:46] already god
[2:21:49] are you there there were gods
[2:21:53] and he said your eyes will be open you
[2:21:55] will be like
[2:21:56] god how can you make me god when i'm
[2:21:59] already god
[2:22:01] i am a woman you say i'm gonna make you
[2:22:04] a woman
[2:22:05] i'm a man i'm gonna make you a man what
[2:22:06] do you mean about making me amen
[2:22:08] [Music]
[2:22:13] hallelujah and you shall be as god
[2:22:17] knowing what good and what
[2:22:20] according to lucifer
[2:22:24] the definition of god
[2:22:28] is to know good
[2:22:32] and water
[2:22:37] what is good and evil
[2:22:40] what is good and evil
[2:22:43] go to genesis 2 verse 9 give me my time
[2:22:47] please
[2:22:48] because i'm in a channel
[2:22:51] let's go to genesis 2 verse 9. and out
[2:22:54] of the ground
[2:22:57] made the lord god to go to grow
[2:23:00] every tree that is pleasant to the sight
[2:23:04] and good for water and the tree of life
[2:23:08] also in the midst of the garden and the
[2:23:11] tree of what
[2:23:14] there is a knowing that tree
[2:23:19] you see no knowledge
[2:23:23] everybody clear no knowledge the tree
[2:23:27] of no knowledge
[2:23:31] the tree of knowledge of water
[2:23:34] and water the tree of
[2:23:37] knowledge of good and water let's go
[2:23:40] back to where we were
[2:23:43] you there verse
[2:23:49] 5 for god does know
[2:23:52] that in the day you eat thereof
[2:23:55] then your eyes shall be opened
[2:23:58] and you shall be as what knowing what
[2:24:03] in other words your deity will be
[2:24:07] abiding on the forbidden tree
[2:24:11] because the knowledge of good and evil
[2:24:15] comes from the wrong tree and your deity
[2:24:19] will be
[2:24:19] perverted into good and evil
[2:24:23] instead of eternal life the tree of life
[2:24:27] are you following me job to verse 6
[2:24:31] and the woman saw that the tree was good
[2:24:34] for food
[2:24:35] and that he was pleasant to the eyes and
[2:24:38] the tree to be desired
[2:24:40] it caused lust to make one wise
[2:24:43] she took the fruit thereof and did it
[2:24:46] and gave to her husband with her
[2:24:48] and he did it let's see now that we
[2:24:52] stopped
[2:24:53] so now the wise now they know
[2:24:57] now they've grown up now they mature
[2:25:00] now they can take their own life nobody
[2:25:03] can tell them
[2:25:04] nothing right
[2:25:08] and the eyes of them both were what
[2:25:13] open to what
[2:25:16] so when your wives are open you begin to
[2:25:18] see vision
[2:25:21] when your eyes are open you begin to see
[2:25:22] heaven open
[2:25:24] what are you seeing when your eyes are
[2:25:26] open
[2:25:27] when you touch that when your eyes are
[2:25:29] open what do you see
[2:25:32] and they knew that there were water
[2:25:35] the first thing that we did is
[2:25:38] automatically
[2:25:40] hey hey
[2:25:44] go behind the bushes move up
[2:25:47] i thought you were god now you are god
[2:25:50] they give you a good deity naturally
[2:25:54] you didn't appreciate it you wanted more
[2:25:59] than what god gave you now you got it
[2:26:02] now you're in trouble they were naked
[2:26:06] and they did water soft fig
[2:26:10] lives together and made themselves water
[2:26:14] so the knowledge of the fig leaves
[2:26:18] is a knowledge that comes from the tree
[2:26:22] of the knowledge of good and evil
[2:26:26] this manufacturing of men
[2:26:30] doesn't come from the wisdom of god man
[2:26:34] took a bite in the wrong tree
[2:26:37] and the wrong tree inspired man
[2:26:41] to begin to make his own clothing
[2:26:47] are you there and his clothing
[2:26:50] was only concerned about
[2:26:54] his private part that he think
[2:26:57] is a shame to be exposed
[2:27:02] can i repeat it again the man
[2:27:05] manufacturer
[2:27:07] that came from the tree of life
[2:27:10] to dress up to cover nakedness
[2:27:14] only insists on the part
[2:27:17] that men feel like he is a shame
[2:27:23] when the women are on the beach
[2:27:28] they only cover two parts
[2:27:33] follow me the manufacturer
[2:27:36] tells them if you cover your breasts
[2:27:41] and if you cover your prophet
[2:27:44] everything else can be hanging out
[2:27:47] it's not gonna do anything then god
[2:27:51] came down to investigate
[2:27:54] the manufacture of a man
[2:27:58] hallelujah let me jump let me
[2:28:02] skip this one the manufacture of a man
[2:28:06] the average woman today is back
[2:28:09] in fig leaves just like eve was
[2:28:14] a fig leaf is actually a
[2:28:17] man-made system shorts
[2:28:22] smoking bob hair yet attractive
[2:28:26] what they do it for to appear
[2:28:29] to the husband if they do
[2:28:33] then he is not the son of god
[2:28:36] he is er if what you
[2:28:39] doing is to please your husband
[2:28:43] then your husband is still having a
[2:28:46] demon
[2:28:48] of lust upon him that's why he tells you
[2:28:53] wear tight dresses to satisfy
[2:28:57] his lust on the street
[2:29:01] and then if he is the son of god he
[2:29:04] shall tell you
[2:29:05] wash your face and put on some clothes
[2:29:08] in other words this doesn't look good
[2:29:10] he's your husband it's not that you are
[2:29:13] not
[2:29:13] attractive but something is telling him
[2:29:16] this is not the appropriate way
[2:29:19] for you to dress hallelujah
[2:29:23] finally they come to worry just a fig
[2:29:25] leaf
[2:29:26] and if you notice in last month life
[2:29:29] magazine
[2:29:30] they had the woman with a fig leaves on
[2:29:33] no wonder jesus when he came on earth
[2:29:37] brother greg he walked and he saw a fig
[2:29:40] tree
[2:29:41] and the fig tree was not in his own
[2:29:44] mouth
[2:29:45] because if the fig tree was in the mouth
[2:29:48] of fruit
[2:29:49] jesus could see the fruit adam never
[2:29:53] used the fruit of the tree
[2:29:57] adam only used the leaves of the tree
[2:30:00] so christ made sure that when he
[2:30:04] goes he spared the fruit but he cursed
[2:30:07] the leaf
[2:30:08] showing you that i am against what men
[2:30:10] use
[2:30:11] to cover themselves up
[2:30:17] are you there and that is the new
[2:30:20] evening frog
[2:30:21] oh god what they wear of the evening
[2:30:26] it is how how can the fig tree
[2:30:30] help you to be your clothes how long is
[2:30:33] that gonna last
[2:30:34] it's gonna dry up are you there
[2:30:37] transparent
[2:30:38] can see what that's why a sister
[2:30:42] should never wear a dress that people
[2:30:44] can see through
[2:30:50] only the fig leaves just hide a certain
[2:30:53] part
[2:30:54] of her body with strapless
[2:30:57] or strap and strap bathing what
[2:31:01] the top of it exposed what that's
[2:31:04] the manufacturing of a man anybody
[2:31:07] following me
[2:31:09] praise the name of the lord let's go
[2:31:11] back
[2:31:12] to genesis now verse 3
[2:31:15] chapter 3 jump to verse
[2:31:19] 8 and they heard the voice of the lord
[2:31:23] walking in the garden of the cool of the
[2:31:25] day and adam his wife and his wife
[2:31:28] hid themselves from the presence of the
[2:31:30] lord if they were clothes
[2:31:33] why did they hide themselves
[2:31:37] are you there if you were clothed why
[2:31:39] did you hit yourself
[2:31:41] because they knew that that clothes
[2:31:43] cannot stand in the presence of god
[2:31:46] amen job to verse 21
[2:31:49] to adam also and to his wife
[2:31:53] so the dress code from god is not only
[2:31:56] for women
[2:31:57] it is for women and men
[2:32:02] are you there young man this is also for
[2:32:05] you
[2:32:06] he said and to adam and to his wife
[2:32:10] did the lord makes water that's a
[2:32:13] different manufacture
[2:32:16] made coat of skin and deep water
[2:32:21] now god is clothing the
[2:32:24] entire body for a purpose
[2:32:28] the first material used by men
[2:32:31] was fig leaves and god cursed that
[2:32:36] but when god used material to cover his
[2:32:41] children
[2:32:42] he used a skin of something
[2:32:46] brother branham say he was a skin of a
[2:32:48] lamb
[2:32:51] where is he written in the bible
[2:32:55] did brother branham lie
[2:32:59] you got trained enough on that one right
[2:33:01] where is he written in the bible that
[2:33:03] it's a skin of the lamb

[2:33:10] when the prophet says something
[2:33:13] even though you don't know it say amen
[2:33:17] and move in peace

[2:37:08] when people look at you they see the
[2:37:10] lamb
[2:37:11] when you walk you walking flat flap is
[2:37:15] speaking about the lamb that guy a lamb
[2:37:17] without that a lamb that died a lamb
[2:37:19] that died
[2:37:20] a lamb that died a lamb that your
[2:37:22] clothing
[2:37:23] is showing the sacrifice
[2:37:27] that took your place your clothing
[2:37:30] have a message your clothing

[2:37:56] you make them seek the lamb you
[2:38:00] make them seek the same god that you
[2:38:02] have
[2:38:03] your clothing speaks of himself
[2:38:06] it is the covering of the lamb
[2:38:10] are you there when king ahazarest
[2:38:14] said seven chamberlain you remember that
[2:38:18] to get the queen what was the last
[2:38:21] chamberlain called
[2:38:23] carcass what did he mean the covering of
[2:38:27] the
[2:38:28] of the lamb are you there
[2:38:32] and we seen that that spoke of the
[2:38:35] constellation of what
[2:38:37] seven ninja that came down and the
[2:38:40] seventh one
[2:38:41] was the one that have a chest up and he
[2:38:44] was the message
[2:38:45] it's a message that come to restore the
[2:38:49] proper attire of a woman
[2:38:52] that's why the message of the hour is
[2:38:55] giving
[2:38:56] women instruction how to dress because
[2:38:59] it's a message
[2:39:00] that brings the covering of the lamb
[2:39:03] back again
[2:39:06] [Applause]
[2:39:08] brother branham is hard on women he's
[2:39:10] not hard on women
[2:39:12] the commission is the lamb must be
[2:39:15] properly
[2:39:16] exposed so go ahead and correct
[2:39:20] their dressing because laodicea is naked
[2:39:24] and does not know it that's why i gotta
[2:39:27] send a message
[2:39:28] to remind them that women should wear
[2:39:32] things like this hallelujah
[2:39:36] we found women in these days
[2:39:40] pushed for beauty it is a natural thing
[2:39:43] for a woman to test
[2:39:44] to be pretty that is her god-given
[2:39:47] instinct
[2:39:49] and her beauty that god gave her for her
[2:39:52] mate husband and now we found out that
[2:39:55] women want to be that way
[2:39:57] why is it it's just because it's
[2:40:00] something
[2:40:01] god gave her it is not wrong for women
[2:40:04] to be praying
[2:40:05] they should be now the true test
[2:40:08] that a woman should have will be to
[2:40:11] adorn
[2:40:11] herself in water modest
[2:40:15] apparel the word more they speak of
[2:40:18] decency we're going to get that down
[2:40:21] deep deep deep maybe not today and to
[2:40:24] have a christ-like spirit
[2:40:26] festivity 2-9 i'm going to get into that
[2:40:30] later
[2:40:30] now that's the way the woman should
[2:40:32] start to be now if you want to be pretty
[2:40:35] that's the way what makes you pretty
[2:40:38] it's a crush
[2:40:39] like water and a dawn in water
[2:40:43] so your attraction is not from
[2:40:46] from your clothing it is coming from an
[2:40:49] atmosphere
[2:40:51] that you have
[2:40:54] we're going to get to that always i have
[2:40:57] been accused of being hard on sisters
[2:41:00] about wearing bob hair and manicure
[2:41:04] all over the face and stuff i have
[2:41:06] always been accused of being hard on the
[2:41:09] system
[2:41:10] and it is not that i got anything
[2:41:12] against them i don't say the woman is
[2:41:14] not a good woman
[2:41:16] that she is a street walker or something
[2:41:18] that is not my attitude
[2:41:20] but it's this when she put so much water
[2:41:25] on the water you are going back to the
[2:41:28] leaf tree
[2:41:32] artificial is something that is
[2:41:36] not natural
[2:41:39] it's something that take more attention
[2:41:43] they're natural
[2:41:48] filled on facebook so there is a lot of
[2:41:51] artificial on the inside
[2:41:54] where or to be filled up with crust
[2:41:56] because the outside
[2:41:58] always express what is what by their
[2:42:02] fruit you shall know them you see
[2:42:04] where christ ought to be there and to
[2:42:06] take care for god
[2:42:07] to care for the other thing instead of
[2:42:10] so much
[2:42:10] artificial pump and you know green water
[2:42:14] we see that in the scripture and on
[2:42:16] human looking
[2:42:18] and all that kind of stuff i just don't
[2:42:20] go for it
[2:42:21] i don't believe the bible does either so
[2:42:23] i like to be just what we
[2:42:27] okay let's get to it let's go to
[2:42:29] jeremiah 4 let's touch one
[2:42:37] finally we got here
[2:42:41] god created you to manifest his glory
[2:42:46] too much artificial you are destroying
[2:42:49] the glory
[2:42:52] that he made too much artificial you
[2:42:54] actually destroying
[2:42:56] his glory let's go to jeremiah chapter
[2:42:59] four
[2:43:00] remember the first thing the eyelid
[2:43:04] remember they painted the eyelid
[2:43:09] they were not happy the way they were
[2:43:11] looking
[2:43:12] they have to put something on the eyelid
[2:43:15] that makes them
[2:43:16] different than what god created if god
[2:43:20] wanted your eyelid to be red
[2:43:22] he would have made it here if god
[2:43:26] wanted you to have blue eyes he would
[2:43:28] have created you with blue eyes
[2:43:31] if god wanted your eyes to be slanted he
[2:43:34] would have created you that way
[2:43:39] right that's what michael jackson missed
[2:43:42] when he had to change his noise
[2:43:45] insulting god
[2:43:47] jeremiah chapter 4 verse 30.

[2:48:12] made herself beautiful by painting her
[2:48:15] eyes
[2:48:16] for her lovers
[2:48:21] do you understand so when you are
[2:48:23] painting your eyes
[2:48:26] when you are painting your face to make
[2:48:28] yourself different
[2:48:31] it is in the bible interpreting that you
[2:48:34] are
[2:48:35] doing that to attract attention
[2:48:38] of your lovers
[2:48:44] lord help me the next come he's a little
[2:48:48] boy
[2:48:49] he was standing there he was a water
[2:48:53] a zulu how can you make your face

[2:48:58] tomorrow
[2:49:00] your boyfriend don't like you anymore

[2:49:09] the bible says your boyfriend will hate
[2:49:12] you
[2:49:16] they cut their ear like this
[2:49:19] and make great in other words they are
[2:49:21] deforming

[2:50:22] years ago
[2:50:24] they didn't use them things but
[2:50:26] something
[2:50:27] happened somewhere is that right
[2:50:32] what's going on brother brandon help me
[2:50:34] more
[2:50:36] by the way speaking of that paint on the
[2:50:38] face
[2:50:39] you pentecostal women used to not do
[2:50:42] that
[2:50:43] what happened i'm just asking you what
[2:50:46] happened
[2:50:47] you did run well what hindered you
[2:50:51] did your pulpit get weak
[2:50:56] you see when a puppet gets weak what he
[2:50:57] does back to painting
[2:51:01] then put him out and get a pastor will
[2:51:04] preach the truth
[2:51:06] if your denomination let you down get
[2:51:08] another denomination

[2:51:14] i don't mean to hurt you i just come
[2:51:16] back from where
[2:51:18] and in there that is hidden water
[2:51:22] the hotento of africa that is where the
[2:51:26] painting comes from from water
[2:51:29] it is a sign of what
[2:51:32] he then is made is condemned by who
[2:51:35] where did brother branham tell you god
[2:51:38] condemn it
[2:51:42] a predefense and what god looked for
[2:51:46] it is a pretty soul that he looks for
[2:51:51] hallelujah i said how can i teach them
[2:51:55] algebra
[2:51:56] when they won't even learn their abcs
[2:51:59] certainly how can you do that such a
[2:52:01] conglomeration of sin

[2:52:06] paint
[2:52:07] is a heated water i'm a missionary
[2:52:11] hidden pet the indian painted their face

[2:52:19] know to god you don't have to tell them
[2:52:22] no
[2:52:22] a burden they take it off shows they are
[2:52:26] at war with god when they take it off
[2:52:29] shows they are at peace with god in
[2:52:31] other words as long as they have not
[2:52:33] made
[2:52:34] peace with god they will continue to
[2:52:36] wear it

[2:54:48] where we saw god say you make beautiful
[2:54:51] yourself
[2:54:52] you are painting your face because men
[2:54:55] are coming when jezebel heard
[2:54:59] that men are coming what did she do
[2:55:06] you see now you see now when you paint
[2:55:09] your face you see
[2:55:10] what you are telling the world
[2:55:13] except you have a very strong reason
[2:55:17] that we can sit and talk because a woman
[2:55:20] want to make herself beautiful
[2:55:24] anybody clear brother stephen can i have
[2:55:27] an appointment quick
[2:55:29] that's it let's go
[2:55:32] jessa had heard of it and she painted
[2:55:36] why when they told her a man
[2:55:39] the governor is coming automatically the
[2:55:43] first thing
[2:55:47] why you didn't do that when he was not
[2:55:49] there
[2:55:50] what was the purpose of that a holy but
[2:55:53] why do you have to do this
[2:55:57] amen she painted her face
[2:56:01] and tired her head and looked out at the
[2:56:06] window and as jihoo entered into the
[2:56:09] gate she said
[2:56:10] exemple peace there is a key there
[2:56:13] who slew his master if you read the book
[2:56:16] of
[2:56:17] the king you will understand what it
[2:56:18] means and he lift up his face to the
[2:56:21] window
[2:56:22] and say who is on my side who
[2:56:26] and dare look out to him two or three
[2:56:29] eunuchs anybody clear
[2:56:32] when jezebel painted her face
[2:56:36] she went and stick her face
[2:56:39] to the window she put her face
[2:56:43] into a profile on facebook
[2:56:52] amen you see everything is in the
[2:56:55] scripture
[2:56:57] she went into a what window
[2:57:00] an internet window
[2:57:08] you didn't do it when you look natural
[2:57:11] you have to paint yourself and brush
[2:57:14] your picture
[2:57:16] then you stick it to the window
[2:57:20] do you think we don't understand the
[2:57:22] message
[2:57:24] you want us to say click
[2:57:27] click click right
[2:57:32] when she did that jihu when he was
[2:57:35] coming
[2:57:36] he was playing he clicked his window
[2:57:40] he saw jesus he said
[2:57:44] oh that's a beautiful woman she's better
[2:57:48] than message believers
[2:57:50] jesus said who is on the lord's side
[2:57:54] take her through heaven
[2:57:59] the king she did it for men
[2:58:06] she didn't have let her natural beauty
[2:58:09] the glory of god reflecting in her to
[2:58:12] attract the husband
[2:58:14] and you do it to attract the wrong one
[2:58:18] anybody clear jezebel
[2:58:21] tired her head because the bible said
[2:58:24] she painted her face and she did what
[2:58:26] tired ahead what does it mean
[2:58:30] jezebel tired her hair which was what
[2:58:35] in the scripture
[2:58:38] in the scripture not only did she
[2:58:40] painted her eyes
[2:58:42] she cut her hair if you want to stick
[2:58:44] with the bible
[2:58:45] you left the message why do you catch
[2:58:47] your hair
[2:58:52] roll it up tired her hair which is a
[2:58:55] disgrace
[2:58:56] a woman that cuts her dishonor her
[2:58:59] husband
[2:59:00] the bible said so a dissonant a
[2:59:03] dishonorable woman
[2:59:04] should be divorced and put away so
[2:59:07] that's a sign
[2:59:08] that showed that she loves somebody what
[2:59:11] because every time it is put
[2:59:15] it is always in the scripture for men
[2:59:18] when you doing that god is interpreting
[2:59:22] that
[2:59:22] that you're looking for somebody else
[2:59:28] to the baba because she dishonor her
[2:59:30] husband
[2:59:31] when she does it you know that's the
[2:59:33] bible how many knows so
[2:59:34] raise up your hand all of you that know
[2:59:36] the bible says that
[2:59:38] then what do you do it for that's what i
[2:59:40] wonder
[2:59:41] i wonder why do why you do it
[2:59:44] because your pastor probably never said
[2:59:46] anything different
[2:59:48] but we need some strict old-fashioned
[2:59:52] evangelistic what
[2:59:57] that shall do what
[3:00:02] okay
[3:00:05] amen blessed be the name of
[3:00:09] like jezebel had learned one things in a
[3:00:12] home
[3:00:13] that was to use paints
[3:00:16] that a hidden treat any paint never in
[3:00:19] the world but
[3:00:20] all painting of face originated with
[3:00:22] hidden it's always condemned by
[3:00:25] believers
[3:00:27] i hope this goes real far down home
[3:00:30] just to make you real good and sick for
[3:00:33] a few minutes
[3:00:35] everybody clear let me skip this and
[3:00:38] then i'm going to go to the airport
[3:00:39] so she was used so she was used to
[3:00:43] painting
[3:00:44] she made herself a little butterfly and
[3:00:47] brother that's the khan
[3:00:49] that can jilt in many good man
[3:00:52] that's why she stick her face in the
[3:00:54] window that's right
[3:00:55] see damn on the street with a little lip
[3:00:59] look like a rosebud and a whole lot of
[3:01:02] much faster on it
[3:01:05] but that shall never burn out the sin
[3:01:07] wrinkle
[3:01:08] don't you never think that god looks
[3:01:10] right through it
[3:01:11] and so jezebel knowed how to put it on
[3:01:15] to make it look she
[3:01:18] put and so when ahab the one playing in
[3:01:22] the church
[3:01:23] this young jewish man become king
[3:01:26] she put manicure on her water
[3:01:31] and whatever you call it you know and
[3:01:34] she flap
[3:01:34] them back and forth i don't want to do
[3:01:37] it
[3:01:38] and ahab's heart went humbling
[3:01:41] god bless you
[3:01:45] because she didn't he didn't have god
[3:01:48] in there to teach him better that's
[3:01:51] right
[3:01:52] what a thing that was amen
[3:01:56] now when she began to flirt with ahab
[3:02:00] i have married her he thought that is
[3:02:02] the just one for me
[3:02:04] and many men made a mistake like that
[3:02:08] and many man has done it
[3:02:11] young people you ready young people you

[3:03:29] face

[3:03:32] sister than the one he was looking for
[3:03:35] until the lady got mad and said did you
[3:03:37] come for her or for me
[3:03:39] because the picture he had was not
[3:03:42] reflecting what she was actually saying

[3:11:26] the same hour body
[3:11:29] was wet with the dew of heaven till his
[3:11:32] water where what like
[3:11:36] eagles what young people where do you
[3:11:39] get hair
[3:11:40] like feathers today
[3:11:47] do you see what you copy you see
[3:11:51] all the african even the caucasian
[3:11:55] they have hairstyle with her that are
[3:11:57] not calm
[3:11:58] they look like feathers
[3:12:01] it happened to this king when
[3:12:05] he got a demon on him
[3:12:11] you are actually reflecting demonic
[3:12:14] kingdom in your body
[3:12:16] it is not glorifying god
[3:12:20] i'm bringing description let's continue
[3:12:24] and these hair were grown like ego
[3:12:27] feathers you remember nebuchadnezzar was
[3:12:28] a man
[3:12:30] because the hair of a man is not
[3:12:31] supposed to grow it's not supposed to
[3:12:33] have hair
[3:12:34] that looks like feathers
[3:12:37] it looks like it's not combed properly
[3:12:41] and the hip-hop star put it and every
[3:12:44] young people nowadays heaven
[3:12:47] do you see where it comes from
[3:12:51] and the women call that beautiful that's
[3:12:53] right so you are
[3:12:54] actually condoning with demons
[3:13:01] oh it's the drip
[3:13:06] shame on you
[3:13:09] till his hair were grown like eagle's
[3:13:12] feathers and his nail like water
[3:13:18] what came on nebuchadnezzar for his nail
[3:13:22] to grow and his hair to be like feathers
[3:13:28] oh my god brother brother
[3:13:31] now there is a place where you get this
[3:13:33] amnesia
[3:13:35] you might not get it like nebuchadnezzar
[3:13:39] who exalted himself one time and god
[3:13:42] let him think he was a what
[3:13:45] when you thinking like animal
[3:13:48] that's what causing this let me continue
[3:13:52] he lived out in the wilderness and eat
[3:13:55] grass like ox
[3:13:56] and his hair grow down like down his
[3:14:00] body
[3:14:00] like ego feathers and he had become the
[3:14:03] heart of a beast in him
[3:14:05] that was amnesia because he had
[3:14:08] forgotten
[3:14:09] that he was a king he had forgotten that
[3:14:12] he was a human being
[3:14:14] and he thought he was a water and so he
[3:14:18] acted like what
[3:14:20] because he forgot he was a human being
[3:14:27] remember that therefore was a beast
[3:14:30] go to deuteronomy 21 probably that's the
[3:14:32] last scripture
[3:14:33] of nails
[3:14:36] deuteronomy chapter 21.
[3:14:41] you want to grow now you know what it
[3:14:43] means
[3:14:46] you know what it means
[3:14:50] detroit number 21.
[3:14:53] if you dare you can say amen verse 10
[3:14:57] when you go forth to war against your
[3:15:00] water
[3:15:01] this is israel going to war against the
[3:15:04] hidden
[3:15:06] because the only believer were the jews
[3:15:09] you understand
[3:15:13] and the lord your god has delivered them
[3:15:15] into your hand
[3:15:16] and you have taken them captive and see
[3:15:20] among the gap the captive award
[3:15:23] so when you go you fight the nation you
[3:15:27] believers
[3:15:28] and when you overcome the nation you
[3:15:30] jewish people
[3:15:32] and you carry captive and among those
[3:15:34] captive they are women
[3:15:36] and when you look among the women you
[3:15:38] find one that is beautiful
[3:15:41] and you want to get married to her what
[3:15:43] does god say
[3:15:44] to israel you get
[3:15:48] and captive a beautiful woman and have a
[3:15:52] desire to her
[3:15:54] that you should have her to your wife
[3:15:57] verse 12 then you shall bring her home
[3:16:02] to your house and she shall save her
[3:16:05] what
[3:16:06] why is she shaving her hair
[3:16:13] the very look that she have is a gentile
[3:16:17] hidden look she cannot enter that
[3:16:21] in the congregation of israel
[3:16:24] you understand come on shave her head
[3:16:29] and pear pear means to trim
[3:16:34] right and trim her what
[3:16:37] it was the hidden women that were
[3:16:40] keeping long nails
[3:16:47] not believers
[3:16:50] sister catch your name
[3:16:54] you are portraying hidden you are
[3:16:57] glorifying hell
[3:16:59] you are not glorifying god
[3:17:02] especially the younger one the one that
[3:17:04] get married
[3:17:05] look at the picture nail like this you
[3:17:08] are actually
[3:17:09] reflecting a hidden kingdom
[3:17:13] catch a nail and i'm going to finish if
[3:17:16] she has not got any fingernail
[3:17:19] and want to put someone if she has not
[3:17:22] got
[3:17:22] any teeth and needs some have not
[3:17:26] got any arm and you need one and have
[3:17:29] not got
[3:17:30] hay and you need some you have not got
[3:17:33] this
[3:17:33] that is different
[3:17:37] if you don't have now and you want to
[3:17:40] put a nail
[3:17:42] brother branham say that's okay
[3:17:46] but don't put nail on top of your
[3:17:48] natural nail
[3:17:51] if you're missing teeth you want to have
[3:17:53] teeth brother brother i'm saying that's
[3:17:55] okay
[3:17:56] if your hair is completely messed up it
[3:17:59] doesn't look good you want to add more
[3:18:01] hair
[3:18:02] to make you look natural brother branham
[3:18:05] say that's okay
[3:18:10] but when you pull out your real good
[3:18:13] teeth
[3:18:14] you see the problem you are now
[3:18:16] destroying the natural
[3:18:18] beauty of god because you just
[3:18:22] want because you just because they are
[3:18:25] just not as
[3:18:26] bright as they should be then you done
[3:18:29] wrong
[3:18:32] you follow me if you got
[3:18:35] red hair and you want black and you go
[3:18:39] down
[3:18:39] here and color it black just because you
[3:18:42] done
[3:18:43] wrong if your hair black keep it black
[3:18:47] don't put pink hair when your hair are
[3:18:49] black
[3:18:52] yeah i think so but the main thing there
[3:18:54] is no scripture for that
[3:18:56] only to bob your hair there is scripture
[3:18:58] for that yeah
[3:19:00] had plenty of that so then we want to
[3:19:02] make sure
[3:19:03] that is right
[3:19:07] where is it no i cannot get to this
[3:19:12] that's for next time
[3:19:15] that's for next time let me get this
[3:19:20] oh my god
[3:19:24] no i cannot get that we got to stop here
[3:19:26] let's stand
[3:19:38] there is another quote that i wanted to
[3:19:40] show you
[3:19:41] lord's willing next sunday i will give
[3:19:43] it to you brother branham said the
[3:19:45] reason why
[3:19:46] hair grew the reason why nabuchadnezzar
[3:19:49] have long nail
[3:19:50] because he was possessed of a demon
[3:19:53] that's the code
[3:19:55] when you wear long nail the scripture
[3:19:58] interpreted
[3:19:59] that it's a spirit you under a spirit
[3:20:03] you don't understand next time lord's
[3:20:05] willing
[3:20:07] i will back up a little bit on this and
[3:20:09] then we're going to get and
[3:20:10] show you what how heal does even to your
[3:20:13] body
[3:20:15] it's going to destroy you it's going to
[3:20:17] destroy your muscles
[3:20:19] it's going to affect your womb
[3:20:23] it's going to affect your womb
[3:20:26] and you're going to have trouble let's
[3:20:29] pray
[3:20:29] heavenly father lord we thank you again
[3:20:32] for your grace
[3:20:33] your love your mercy father and for
[3:20:35] everything you're doing for us
[3:20:37] thank you thank you lord for this easter
[3:20:40] morning and for speaking to
[3:20:42] us father these are hard territory
[3:20:46] this is a hard domain where people
[3:20:50] usually are not comfortable to be robbed
[3:20:53] in this area father this is not a word
[3:20:56] of a man
[3:20:58] because you say let every word of a man
[3:21:01] father there is no even way we can even
[3:21:03] regard the word of a man
[3:21:05] but the only word that will stand true
[3:21:07] for heaven
[3:21:08] is your own word because heaven and
[3:21:10] earth will pass away
[3:21:12] but not your word lord we have spoken
[3:21:16] we spoke about easter father we spoke
[3:21:18] about lord
[3:21:20] father this territory of the black dog
[3:21:22] that is affecting us
[3:21:24] lord bringing us to lose our own
[3:21:27] identity
[3:21:28] we are losing our own appreciation of
[3:21:31] what we are
[3:21:32] we feel like we don't look good the way
[3:21:35] you created us
[3:21:36] until we have to put stuff artificial
[3:21:39] things
[3:21:40] to please people on the outside not
[3:21:43] knowing that we are not reflecting
[3:21:45] heaven
[3:21:46] but we are reflecting the kingdom of
[3:21:48] darkness
[3:21:49] father and they are young men looking at
[3:21:52] this
[3:21:53] probably through ignorance what they
[3:21:55] were calling beautiful
[3:21:56] they didn't know that it was not a
[3:21:58] reflection of
[3:22:00] what is holy acceptable and good in your
[3:22:03] sight
[3:22:04] that they should not be looking at women
[3:22:06] that portray themselves like that
[3:22:08] they should not being attracted with any
[3:22:11] woman that is showing herself
[3:22:13] and putting more artificial lord because
[3:22:16] it's
[3:22:16] reflecting that something in the soul is
[3:22:19] not right with you
[3:22:21] father may you give a discernment may
[3:22:23] you help this church
[3:22:25] may you help the young sister may you
[3:22:27] help the young brother
[3:22:29] may you help the family to understand
[3:22:31] lord that this
[3:22:32] is not a code of law this is not a code
[3:22:35] of ethic
[3:22:36] but this is the unfailing body word of
[3:22:39] the son of man
[3:22:40] coming to clean up the life of your
[3:22:43] children so that we can reflect and
[3:22:45] glorify
[3:22:46] you in our body and in our spirit and
[3:22:49] bring our body to be living
[3:22:51] sacrifice unto thee so that when people
[3:22:54] look they can have a message whole
[3:22:57] preach
[3:22:57] just by the way we portray ourselves in
[3:23:00] front of the children
[3:23:01] father we commit everything unto the
[3:23:03] hand we thank you for all
[3:23:05] and ask it in the name of jesus christ
[3:23:14] amen
