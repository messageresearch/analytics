[8:52] [Music]
[8:56] There is none like you.
[9:06] No one else can touch my heart like you

[9:21] and find
[9:24] there is none like you.
[9:32] There is none like you my Jesus.
[9:40] No one else can touch my heart like you

[10:29] there is none like
[10:33] you.
[10:36] [Music]
[10:40] Lord is true, Lord.
[10:43] There's none like you, Lord Jesus.
[10:47] Lord, your presence is overwhelming this
[10:49] morning, Lord.
[10:51] I was standing back there with brother
[10:54] Logos, Lord, and we could feel you back
[10:56] there already, Lord, before the service
[10:58] even started. Lord,
[11:01] what a wonderful thing to think, Lord
[11:03] God, that you're here waiting for us
[11:05] when we come through those doors. Lord
[11:07] God,
[11:09] you come to express yourself to us this
[11:11] morning, Lord.
[11:13] We're your children, Lord.
[11:16] And we want to know, Lord, what's on
[11:18] your mind today, Lord God,
[11:20] we want to make you feel welcome, Lord,
[11:22] enough to sit down on the pew this
[11:24] morning next to us, Lord, and just tell
[11:27] us something, Lord God.
[11:29] It doesn't matter, Lord. As long as
[11:31] you're talking and you're speaking,
[11:33] Lord, and you tell us, Lord, that's all
[11:36] that matters, Lord.
[11:39] Just like a child's anxious to hear from
[11:41] their natural daddy, Lord God. We want
[11:44] to hear from our daddy this morning,
[11:46] Lord.
[11:48] We ask, Lord God, that you forgive us of
[11:50] anything that may hinder that this
[11:52] morning, Lord Jesus.
[11:54] Cover us by the blood, Lord God. We
[11:56] plead the blood
[11:59] and just come, Lord God, and anoint our
[12:01] musicians this morning, Lord.
[12:04] Anoint our singers, Lord. What a
[12:07] wonderful thing, Lord, to have these
[12:09] singers here, Lord.
[12:11] Bless our technicians this morning,
[12:13] Lord, that everything goes just right
[12:15] for you.
[12:17] Lord, we know that the audience isn't
[12:19] just what's before us here, Lord, but
[12:20] it's also across the lines, Lord, across
[12:23] the waves, even across the seas, Lord
[12:26] God.
[12:28] So, we want what we experience to go
[12:30] there, Lord, and to have them experience
[12:33] it as well.
[12:35] And Lord, bless our pastor this morning,
[12:37] Lord, in that little room up front,
[12:39] Lord.
[12:41] And just bless him this morning, Lord.
[12:44] Lord, let nothing hinder what you have
[12:45] for us, Lord. Let those lips of clay
[12:48] speak freely this morning, Lord God,
[12:50] without hindrance or time, any of it,
[12:54] Lord. Just speak what's on your heart to
[12:56] us this morning, Lord.
[12:59] There is none of none like you, Lord
[13:02] God. We didn't come to hear from a man
[13:06] or from each other.
[13:08] We came to hear from almighty God
[13:10] straight from the throne.
[13:13] So have your perfect will this morning
[13:15] Lord in each life.
[13:17] Speak to us Lord where we need to hear
[13:19] it in our lives.
[13:22] And may we surrender ourselves to you
[13:24] Lord once again and rededicate ourselves
[13:29] for you have given us so much Lord.
[13:32] You've given us so much Lord.
[13:36] Let the whirlwind
[13:38] be known this morning in the little
[13:39] building. Lord, have your perfect will.
[13:43] We give you all glory, honor, and
[13:45] praise, Lord, in everything that is sung
[13:47] this morning and spoken in Jesus
[13:49] Christ's name. Amen. And amen and amen.
[13:54] Y'all turn around and greet each other.
[13:55] Let's give the Lord a hand this morning.
[13:58] Without him, this meeting would be
[13:59] nothing but in vain. We can do better.
[14:02] But let's give him a clap offering.
[14:03] Amen. Hallelujah.
[14:07] Amen. Thank you, Lord.
[14:10] Amen.
[14:13] [Music]
[14:52] Now, if you're in the battle for the
[14:55] Lord and the right, keep on the firing
[15:00] line.
[15:02] And if you win, my brother, surely you
[15:06] must fight. You just keep on the firing
[15:10] line.
[15:13] There are many dangers that we all must
[15:16] face. If we die in his glorious place
[15:23] in the service and we'll find a place to
[15:28] find the fire
[15:32] [Music]
[15:38] and never
[15:40] glory
[15:42] behind.
[15:43] You will win for the right

[16:48] [Music]
[16:54] And we get to heaven for we all

[42:22] here. We say amen. We rejoice in the
[42:25] word of the Lord. We shout and we are
[42:28] free in the spirit. Amen.
[42:30] Amen.
[42:30] Amen.
[42:31] Amen.
[42:31] I believe we up to date with our sermon.
[42:34] We reading our Bible twice a day. Good
[42:36] to see you, BJ. Welcome. Amen. And our
[42:40] COD, our church ages, 70 weeks of
[42:42] Daniel, the seals adoption or somebody
[42:46] is listening to the message of the hour.
[42:48] Amen.
[42:48] Amen.
[42:49] Lord's willing, this coming Saturday,
[42:52] it's question and answer. It's July the
[42:54] 19th, so the last question will be uh
[42:56] picked on Wednesday. So make sure you
[42:58] send it on Wednesday because after
[43:00] Wednesday, don't send me at the last
[43:02] minute. You say, "Hey, I have a question
[43:04] that I already have something to do with
[43:06] it." Amen. So July the 19th question and
[43:10] answer the Youngsman meeting is August
[43:12] the 9th. I'm repeating this every
[43:14] Sunday. So you don't have any excuse to
[43:16] say you didn't hear it. Amen. If you
[43:19] miss it the first Sunday, you're going
[43:20] to hear it the next Sunday. So, Young's
[43:22] men meeting on August the 9th, which is
[43:25] part two. We continue with uh uh our
[43:28] courtship. The reason why I had to
[43:30] approach the courtship with men the way
[43:32] I wanted uh the way we did it is because
[43:35] man is the head.
[43:38] The sister is completely a different
[43:40] story. Amen.
[43:41] So, if uh you were expecting for me to
[43:44] talk to them first, I mean the first
[43:45] time. Okay. How do you talk to a woman?
[43:47] Hey, let's leave that.
[43:50] Let's leave that down. You need to know
[43:52] what is a man first.
[43:55] Amen.
[43:56] And how does God prepare a man
[43:59] before he gave him a wife?
[44:03] Amen.
[44:04] Amen.
[44:06] Amen.
[44:06] Amen.
[44:07] You should be even happy
[44:09] because uh my ministry is dealing with
[44:13] two categories. We got the older one
[44:17] including myself who got married
[44:20] without the training you are getting.
[44:22] I wish somebody taught me what I'm
[44:24] teaching you.
[44:26] Glor.
[44:27] So as I'm meditating and learning
[44:29] everything, I say I wish I knew this
[44:32] before I was married.
[44:34] But God by his sovereign grace didn't
[44:36] allow it.
[44:38] So you are getting everything. You are
[44:40] well equipped to avoid any problem.
[44:43] Any problem. In other words, when I
[44:45] marry you here in this church,
[44:47] I don't want to hear the things that the
[44:51] old generation went through.
[44:55] I don't know if we're together.
[44:56] Amen.
[44:57] Young men, if you planning on coming to
[44:59] search for a woman here, make sure you
[45:02] stick with what we taught here.
[45:04] Yes, sir.
[45:04] Are we together?
[45:05] Amen.
[45:06] Because of them, they were forerunner.
[45:08] Amen.
[45:09] They went through many difficulty and
[45:11] things. I mean just imagine you both of
[45:14] you are unsaved
[45:18] in the world
[45:19] and you married in the world.
[45:21] What do you expect?
[45:23] What you expect? Amen.
[45:25] Uhhuh.
[45:25] Amen.
[45:26] It's a crush. That's what it is.
[45:29] It is a failure.
[45:31] It's going to be argument and and and
[45:34] fighting and and and bickering
[45:36] everything left and right before both of
[45:39] you get converted.
[45:41] And then you begin to know what the word
[45:43] say.
[45:44] And then you begin to recalibrate the
[45:46] family. But there is a lot of scar,
[45:49] a lot of wound, a lot of disappointment,
[45:52] a lot of I wish if I knew I would not
[45:54] have put myself into this,
[45:56] a lot of treaties.
[46:02] Can you say amen?
[46:03] Amen.
[46:03] If you go like this, we're not going to
[46:05] move. Amen. A lot of marriages in the
[46:09] message are living by treaties.
[46:13] I'm responsible for what I say.
[46:15] We know how to fake.
[46:18] [Music]
[46:19] We know really how to fake.
[46:22] Especially when it's in the public.
[46:26] That's when we want to show that ah we
[46:28] are married.
[46:29] But truly you are living in hell.
[46:33] I'm not talking about denomination.
[46:36] I am not talking about sinners.
[46:38] I'm talking about what is going on in
[46:41] the message.
[46:45] Are we together?
[46:46] Amen.
[46:47] Are we together?
[46:47] Amen.
[46:48] A lot of marriages are in treaties.
[46:52] Treaties of peace.
[46:54] [Applause]
[46:56] In other words, there is argument for 20
[46:58] years
[46:59] and then we came up. We say, you know
[47:01] what? Let me let's sit down and talk.
[47:04] Okay. If we want to live in peace, don't
[47:06] touch my phone.
[47:08] Right. Right.
[47:10] Don't look at my Facebook account.
[47:14] Come on, brother.
[47:16] You mind your business.
[47:18] I mind my business. And then when we
[47:21] need intimacy,
[47:23] we can give to each other. But don't get
[47:25] into my problem. In other words, don't
[47:28] push this button and we will live in
[47:31] peace. And the woman especially if she
[47:34] have more than three children she say
[47:36] you know what I'm going to stick in this
[47:38] marriage because if I leave my children
[47:39] are going to be miserable
[47:42] and then we sign the treaty of peace
[47:46] then we begin to live in peace
[47:49] preach.
[47:52] Do you argue with your husband? No.
[47:55] Why? Because you know
[47:57] that if you argue
[47:59] Amen.
[48:00] Amen.
[48:01] Amen. Amen.
[48:04] There is a nuclear weapon.
[48:07] Do you know the nuclear weapon?
[48:09] Break it down.
[48:10] Break it down.
[48:11] Do you know what a nuclear weapon is?
[48:13] A cru a nuclear weapon have more
[48:15] destruction
[48:17] than the normal weapon. That's right.
[48:19] That's why you see they telling Iran,
[48:21] Iran, you cannot have nuclear weapon
[48:24] because they know if they put it in the
[48:26] hand of a crazy man,
[48:28] a nuclear weapon can destroy an entire
[48:30] city.
[48:32] Are we together? So there is a
[48:34] convention in the United Nation. If you
[48:38] ever try to use it, the whole world goes
[48:41] against you.
[48:42] Right?
[48:43] Yeah.
[48:43] I don't know if you understand it,
[48:45] but the United States have it.
[48:48] Russia has it.
[48:51] There are certain country they have it.
[48:53] They have it not to use now
[48:55] until in extreme situation.
[48:59] In other word, it's a weapon when they
[49:01] tell you if you keep pushing me.
[49:04] Just know I have it.
[49:06] Amen.
[49:06] If you keep bagging with me at the last
[49:08] minute, I'm going to destroy you. So
[49:10] when you hear nuclear, you back up.
[49:12] That's why you hear Putin, I'm going to
[49:14] go to nuclear. In other words, he's
[49:15] telling you, hey, back up.
[49:17] back up.
[49:18] And in our marriages, we got nuclear
[49:20] weapon.
[49:22] [Music]
[49:24] If you continue, I'm going to leave.
[49:27] Once you hear the word leave, then you
[49:29] back up.
[49:30] So you are living with fear. Brother,
[49:32] I'm saying it should not be like that.
[49:34] Yes, sir.
[49:34] I have the quote. Brother Brand, I'm
[49:36] saying it should not be like if you
[49:38] traveling, if I hear you with a woman,
[49:40] you are divorced. Brother, I'm say
[49:42] that's not it.
[49:43] Correct. Amen.
[49:44] That's beautiful.
[49:45] Amen. Your wife is living with you in a
[49:48] treaty of peace.
[49:50] There is no love.
[49:53] It's a laws.
[49:54] It's a bunch of rules.
[49:57] Amen.
[49:58] We should be ruled by love.
[50:00] That's right. Amen.
[50:03] Even if I make a mistake, he understand
[50:05] me.
[50:05] Amen.
[50:06] He love me.
[50:08] It is not if I make a mistake, then I'm
[50:10] going to be in trouble. The same thing
[50:12] apply with our relationship with God.
[50:15] Correct.
[50:16] I'm trying to serve God because I don't
[50:18] want to go to hell.
[50:20] It's a problem.
[50:21] That's right.
[50:21] Because if God remove hell,
[50:24] oh, I wonder how many people will be in
[50:27] church.
[50:29] If God just said there is no more hell,
[50:32] oh, you will see sister in the message
[50:34] in Pent wearing hearing and never
[50:37] because there's no more hell. In other
[50:38] words, we are serving God out of fear.
[50:42] Instead of serving God out of love based
[50:45] on the work of Calvary,
[50:48] I don't know if we together.
[50:50] Amen.
[50:51] I'm living with my husband because I
[50:53] love him.
[50:55] I'm living with my wife because I love
[50:57] her.
[50:58] My husband will make mistake. My wife
[51:00] will make mistake. But I still love him.
[51:02] I will stand with him. I will support
[51:04] him. I will help him.
[51:06] Amen.
[51:07] Amen. Amen.
[51:10] That's it. That's it. Are we together?
[51:12] Are we together?
[51:13] Amen.
[51:14] So the younger generation, I don't want
[51:16] you to go through this.
[51:18] I want you to hear it
[51:20] as a testimony, but never experience it.
[51:24] Because it's painful.
[51:25] Lord,
[51:26] are we together?
[51:27] Amen.
[51:27] So when I'm giving you all these
[51:28] instructions, soak it
[51:30] and enter into your marriage and never
[51:32] have to experience it.
[51:35] Amen.
[51:35] You don't want to sit and say, you know
[51:37] what, I heard too much about nightclair.
[51:39] Let me go tonight. Clay, when you go
[51:41] there, you don't know if you're going to
[51:42] come out.
[51:42] That's right, brother.
[51:44] So and so did it. Let me do it. You do
[51:46] it the first time. Pop heads.
[51:49] HIV.
[51:50] And we will see what you're going to do.
[51:52] Everybody else did it. No. HIV. Yours.
[51:53] Pum HIV.
[51:56] What are you going to do?
[51:58] I'm trying to prevent you from going
[51:59] that route.
[52:01] I want you to have the best marriage. I
[52:03] want your generation to reflect sir
[52:05] a true marriage according to the message
[52:08] of the hour
[52:10] and with the older generation we
[52:12] continue to cure marriages and to work
[52:14] and to work and to fix things left and
[52:16] right and change the engine and change
[52:18] the the the the
[52:23] do you call transmission and everything
[52:25] we keep changing until the car is
[52:27] running.
[52:27] Amen.
[52:28] But you God is giving you a brand new
[52:30] car zero mileage.
[52:34] Are we together?
[52:36] Are we together?
[52:37] Amen.
[52:38] That is the reason why I'm going the way
[52:40] I'm going with courtship.
[52:43] Amen.
[52:43] Amen.
[52:44] Because if a man is in trouble, the
[52:46] whole family is in trouble.
[52:49] That's correct.
[52:50] And it's a disaster.
[52:51] Are we together?
[52:52] Amen.
[52:53] So, married couple meeting as we fixing
[52:55] transmissions and everything. See you on

[53:12] separated so you have ample time to work
[53:14] with your schedule and the young sisters
[53:17] meeting will be September the 27. It's
[53:20] going to be a question and answer. So
[53:21] send me your question so we can sit and
[53:24] talk. Don't wait at the last minute and
[53:26] night and begin to fire all the
[53:29] questions because I need to read some of
[53:31] them and make sure my way is giving you
[53:33] the answer by the scripture and what
[53:35] brother Brandham say. I don't want you
[53:37] to say brother Steven say amen.

[53:50] brother Robert. They're going to look it
[53:51] up again. They say they fix it already.

[53:56] They're working on it. So, we will fix
[53:58] it and you will have the link that can
[54:00] help you give the contribution. And God

[54:08] uh flyer for the annual missionary uh
[54:12] camp meeting. It will start from August
[54:14] the 5th all the way to August the 8th.

[54:20] Tuesday to a Friday. So if you can

[54:25] if you cannot make it on Tuesday, try to
[54:28] see if we can make it on Thursday or if
[54:30] you can make it on Friday, show some

[56:47] far as I can go with the ability you
[56:49] have given me. But when it comes, Lord,
[56:51] to ministering, teaching, preaching your
[56:54] word to your children, Lord, you only
[56:56] take the supernatural action of the Holy
[56:59] Spirit. Father, we are very limited in
[57:01] our own ability. So may you move us
[57:04] completely out of the way. Those that
[57:06] are here and invisible audience, Father,
[57:09] move me completely out of the way. May
[57:11] May you be the one speaking, the one
[57:13] hearing, the one blessing, the one
[57:15] interpreting. And may your power fall
[57:17] down and touch every aspect of our life.
[57:20] Heal those that are sick. Fill those
[57:22] that need the Holy Spirit. Father, touch
[57:25] those that need to be touched in a
[57:26] specific area. May Lord, Father, we live
[57:29] this building differently than the way
[57:31] we came in, Lord. Father, we rebuke
[57:33] every gloomy weather, atmosphere,
[57:36] influence, every spirit that will l l l
[57:39] l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l
[57:39] l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l lure
[57:39] the people and try to put them to sleep
[57:41] or distract them father may we stay
[57:44] focused and give preeminence to the word
[57:46] may you be the beginning and the ending
[57:48] Lord in the name of Jesus Christ amen
[57:53] Leviticus 19 verse 9 if you dare you can
[57:56] say amen
[57:57] very familiar the Bible says and when
[58:00] you reap the harvest of your land. You
[58:03] shall not holy wholly reap the corners
[58:07] of your field. You may be seated.
[58:09] Neither shall you gather the gleaning of
[58:13] your harvest. Amen.
[58:15] You know this. I'm just touching up to
[58:17] make a point. Verse 10. And you shall
[58:20] not glean your vineyard, neither shall
[58:23] you gather every grape of your vineyard.
[58:26] You shall leave them for the poor and
[58:30] stranger. So the category given here is
[58:35] for somebody who's poor
[58:38] and somebody who's a stranger to Israel.
[58:41] Amen. So God providence for the poor and
[58:46] for the stranger.
[58:48] When in the time of harvest,
[58:53] the season is in harvest.
[58:56] Amen. So in the harvest, in the season,
[58:59] God already provided for the poor and
[59:03] for the stranger. God provided food.
[59:05] We clear?
[59:06] Amen.
[59:07] We clear?
[59:08] Amen.
[59:08] This is the book of Leviticus. And the
[59:11] five first book was written by Moses.
[59:14] In other word, these book were written
[59:16] during the Exodus
[59:19] because Moses never made it to the
[59:20] promises.
[59:22] I hope we together.
[59:24] Amen.
[59:24] Amen. So these books were written in the
[59:27] wilderness
[59:28] and Israel stays there 40 years.
[59:31] Are we together?
[59:32] Praise God. Let's go to the book of
[59:35] Deuteronomy.
[59:37] 23.
[59:40] I was trying to mention this, but since
[59:42] it's 23 and 24, we can read 23. Let's go
[59:46] to the book of Deuteronomy 23
[59:51] verse three. If you there, you can say
[59:53] amen.
[59:54] Amen. Amen.
[59:55] The Bible say an Ammonat,
[59:57] we're not dealing with it.
[59:59] You know where I'm going.
[1:00:00] Or a Moabat or Moabat. Amen.
[1:00:04] Shall not enter into the congregation of
[1:00:08] the Lord.
[1:00:08] Yes.
[1:00:09] This is thus sayith the Lord.
[1:00:11] Yes sir.
[1:00:12] Amen.
[1:00:12] Amen.
[1:00:14] Even to the 10th generation.
[1:00:16] 10th generation.
[1:00:18] Amen.
[1:00:19] Shall they not enter in the congregation
[1:00:22] of the Lord when
[1:00:24] forever?
[1:00:24] So, do we have a room for a Moabitete?
[1:00:26] No.
[1:00:32] How did Ruth made it?
[1:00:38] Amen.
[1:00:39] Amen.
[1:00:41] So, when you see roof,
[1:00:43] you can bring the coat.
[1:00:45] Wow. Come on, brother. Come on now,
[1:00:48] brother.
[1:00:48] You say, "Sister Roof,
[1:00:50] I got a court for you.
[1:00:51] I got a court for you.
[1:00:53] Just know whatever you're doing,
[1:00:55] you're not getting here."
[1:00:59] My God. Come on, brother.
[1:01:00] Are we together?
[1:01:01] My God.
[1:01:02] Are we together?
[1:01:03] My God.
[1:01:03] That's why you heard Ruth before she
[1:01:05] goes to the promised land,
[1:01:08] she say, "My people,
[1:01:10] your people
[1:01:12] will be my people.
[1:01:13] Your God will be my God." In other
[1:01:16] words, I'm no longer a moite.
[1:01:20] [Applause]
[1:01:23] I hope we are together, my friend.
[1:01:26] Amen.
[1:01:27] Because Rof was dealing with the tribe
[1:01:30] of Judah.
[1:01:32] Amen.
[1:01:33] Amen.
[1:01:34] Rome from the tribe of Judah.
[1:01:36] Amen.
[1:01:37] And the tribe of Judah has a scepter.
[1:01:39] That's correct, brother.
[1:01:40] Amen.
[1:01:41] The Bible say the scepter shall never
[1:01:43] leave Judah.
[1:01:44] That's right. And the scepter give you
[1:01:46] power
[1:01:47] to go above the law.
[1:01:50] Glory.
[1:01:51] I hope we together my friend.
[1:01:53] Is this too strong?
[1:01:54] No.
[1:01:55] Do you remember Esther?
[1:01:57] Do you remember Esther?
[1:01:58] The Lord say you don't enter
[1:02:00] if you are not call.
[1:02:02] When she entered death
[1:02:05] the king pulled the scepter
[1:02:08] and kick the B. In other way you don't
[1:02:10] touch it.
[1:02:11] The scepter can open up a way when there
[1:02:14] is no way.
[1:02:15] That's right.
[1:02:15] And the scepter was given to Judah.
[1:02:18] I hope we together.
[1:02:20] And Ruth was entering through the line
[1:02:22] of Judah.
[1:02:24] And if you look at the lineage of Jesus
[1:02:27] Christ in Matthew 1, every strange woman
[1:02:31] entered that lineage from through Judah.
[1:02:37] Through Judah.
[1:02:38] Yes, sir.
[1:02:40] through Judah.
[1:02:42] Ruth through Judah.
[1:02:44] Rahab the prostitute.
[1:02:47] Judah
[1:02:47] through Judah
[1:02:50] because Judah is the entrance
[1:02:53] and Jesus Christ is the lion of the
[1:02:55] tribe of Judah.
[1:02:58] So we Gentile, we were far away from
[1:03:00] God. But because of the lion of the
[1:03:03] tribe of Judah, an entrance was open for
[1:03:06] the Gentile. And now we can be called
[1:03:09] sons of God and daughters of God.
[1:03:12] Amen.
[1:03:12] Now we are the bride of Jesus Christ.
[1:03:15] Amen.
[1:03:16] We are more Jews than those that are in
[1:03:19] Israel.
[1:03:21] Because we are the royal seed
[1:03:24] of Abraham.
[1:03:25] Amen.
[1:03:30] Are we together?
[1:03:31] Amen.
[1:03:32] Are we together?
[1:03:33] Amen.
[1:03:34] No moreite.
[1:03:38] in Israel.
[1:03:43] Huh? Ruth
[1:03:46] by birth.
[1:03:48] Moabat.
[1:03:50] Hey, so God made a mistake.
[1:03:55] Oh
[1:03:57] my friend,
[1:03:59] God put the law. God already gave his
[1:04:02] word. If God want to save Ruth,
[1:04:05] God should know better
[1:04:07] than to put her in the land of Moab
[1:04:14] bird brain.
[1:04:16] Our brain very tiny like this.
[1:04:19] Amen. That's right.
[1:04:21] Then the brain of God.
[1:04:23] Are we together?
[1:04:24] Amen.
[1:04:25] That was 233. I'm reading the Bible. I
[1:04:27] have not start preaching yet.
[1:04:30] Okay.
[1:04:30] Amen. Deuteronomy 24.
[1:04:35] If you're there, you can say amen.
[1:04:37] Amen.
[1:04:39] Hallelujah. Verse 19. Amen.
[1:04:45] When you cut down your harvest in your
[1:04:48] field and have forgotten a sheath,
[1:04:52] a big one,
[1:04:54] sometime it's the juicy one that stays
[1:04:56] there.
[1:04:58] Amen. Amen.
[1:04:59] And you forgotten your sheep in the
[1:05:01] field, you shall not go again to bring
[1:05:04] it.
[1:05:05] In other words, it's God who made you
[1:05:07] forgotten.
[1:05:15] Like, oh my God, how how did I miss
[1:05:18] this?
[1:05:18] Right?
[1:05:20] And the law is coming back. Don't touch
[1:05:22] it. It's not for you.
[1:05:26] Amen.
[1:05:27] You shall not go again to bring it. You
[1:05:31] can refocus this. It shall be for the
[1:05:34] stranger, for the
[1:05:36] fatherless, and for the what?
[1:05:38] Widow.
[1:05:39] We got three
[1:05:41] things here. We got a stranger.
[1:05:45] We got fatherless. You understand this?
[1:05:48] And we got who?
[1:05:49] Widow.
[1:05:52] We got widow. Amen. It shall be for the
[1:05:54] stranger, the fatherless, and for the
[1:05:56] widow, that the Lord your God may bless
[1:05:59] you in all the work of your hand.
[1:06:02] That's right.
[1:06:03] Amen.
[1:06:04] So when you when when when things are
[1:06:06] sleeping your hand,
[1:06:07] it's also a blessing.
[1:06:09] That's
[1:06:11] amen.
[1:06:12] You who are too stingy,
[1:06:13] too stingy
[1:06:14] and no blessing.
[1:06:16] I won't get to that. I already give you
[1:06:17] a few scripture. If you want to sit with
[1:06:19] me, I will load you, perfuse you with
[1:06:21] scripture. Amen. Amen.
[1:06:23] Amen. You too stingy. $1. $2. No
[1:06:26] problem. You will get $2 and $1. Amen.
[1:06:30] Are we together?
[1:06:31] Amen.
[1:06:32] Let's go to the book of Ruth.
[1:06:35] Chapter one. You're doing good.
[1:06:40] It is me and my family alone. Stingy.
[1:06:47] Are we together?
[1:06:49] Are we together? Amen.
[1:06:51] What I want you to understand here,
[1:06:55] this scripture came from Leviticus.
[1:06:58] I'm going slow so we soak in. This
[1:07:01] scripture came from Deuteronomy.
[1:07:04] This one came from Deuteronomy.
[1:07:06] So all these books were written by
[1:07:08] Moses.
[1:07:10] When he was in the wilderness,
[1:07:13] Ruth was not born yet.
[1:07:18] I hope we are together.
[1:07:20] So God provided a scripture
[1:07:24] for Rof before she was born.
[1:07:28] Amen.
[1:07:30] Amen.
[1:07:31] I hope we together.
[1:07:32] Amen.
[1:07:33] So when Ruth is born, the scripture is
[1:07:36] already there.
[1:07:37] Amen.
[1:07:38] Are we together?
[1:07:39] Amen.
[1:07:39] God provided the scripture before you
[1:07:42] were born.
[1:07:44] All of us here, we were born after the
[1:07:46] death of Jesus Christ.
[1:07:49] That's right.
[1:07:49] We clear.
[1:07:51] But when roof is born,
[1:07:53] roof is locked by this scripture
[1:07:57] which we understood already had to come
[1:08:00] out of this scripture.
[1:08:01] Go through the life of Judah and Rof say
[1:08:04] you know what my people shall be my your
[1:08:06] people and all of that thing. Amen.
[1:08:08] What I'm trying to make you understand
[1:08:11] Rof
[1:08:13] By God's grace, begin to give God glory.
[1:08:15] Say, I got a husband.
[1:08:17] I got a husband from the land of Judah.
[1:08:21] Oh, praise the Lord. I was praying for
[1:08:22] one and God gave her a husband.
[1:08:27] And she married a husband and she was
[1:08:29] living fine for some reason. No baby.
[1:08:32] Amen.
[1:08:33] It doesn't mean you out of the will of
[1:08:35] God. Leave that alone. I'm just pointing
[1:08:37] something. No baby.
[1:08:39] Amen.
[1:08:39] Amen.
[1:08:41] They said no let's hold on no baby and
[1:08:44] for some reason the husband died
[1:08:51] and roof begin to wonder say why Lord
[1:08:54] I'm too young like this
[1:08:56] and I'm going to be a widow younger
[1:08:59] are we together
[1:09:01] leader did she know
[1:09:04] that her tragedies
[1:09:07] right right
[1:09:08] hallelujah Her trial,
[1:09:12] her tribulation,
[1:09:13] right,
[1:09:14] her difficulty
[1:09:16] was were only shaping her
[1:09:20] to fit the scripture.
[1:09:22] [Applause]
[1:09:26] I hope we together
[1:09:28] because if Ruth was married,
[1:09:32] she would not qualify.
[1:09:34] She can qualify as a stranger,
[1:09:37] but she won't qualify as a widow.
[1:09:40] She won't qualif She can she won't
[1:09:42] qualify as a poor.
[1:09:44] That's why God allowed Naomi to be poor.
[1:09:51] So your tragedy are working together for
[1:09:54] good.
[1:09:56] Amen.
[1:09:57] your trial, whatever is happening in
[1:10:00] your life,
[1:10:01] everything work together for good.
[1:10:04] [Music]
[1:10:05] If what is happening in your life is not
[1:10:08] a blessing and it's something that is
[1:10:11] bringing pain, just tell the devil, you
[1:10:13] know what? He's shaping me.
[1:10:15] Yes, sir.
[1:10:16] He's preparing me
[1:10:18] to fit a promise.
[1:10:20] Yes, sir.
[1:10:25] Are we together?
[1:10:26] You remember Jim Mama? Mama.
[1:10:28] Yeah.
[1:10:28] Jim Mama, do you remember
[1:10:30] she was a widow?
[1:10:31] Correct.
[1:10:32] And if she was not a widow, she would
[1:10:33] not have used the scripture to pull
[1:10:36] brother Brandham from the airplane.
[1:10:38] But because she was a widow, sir,
[1:10:40] the her widowhood
[1:10:43] provided the scripture for her. And when
[1:10:45] she went to the scripture, brother Brham
[1:10:48] was on the airplane going somewhere else
[1:10:51] and God pulled the airplane down.
[1:10:54] The widowhood was a blessing
[1:10:57] to save her child.
[1:10:59] Amen.
[1:11:03] Are we together?
[1:11:04] Amen.
[1:11:04] I'm trying to take you to a point where
[1:11:07] everything you see in your life is God.
[1:11:10] In good time and bad time, it is God.
[1:11:13] Yes, sir.
[1:11:16] Are we together my friend?
[1:11:18] Are we together?
[1:11:19] Are we together?
[1:11:20] Amen.
[1:11:20] Then suddenly the husband died.
[1:11:23] Right.
[1:11:23] Right.
[1:11:25] And as human being when a tragedy
[1:11:27] happened
[1:11:28] we usually immorphy.
[1:11:30] Correct.
[1:11:32] We we we we we try to accommodate
[1:11:36] we try to rearrange
[1:11:38] the situation
[1:11:40] to fit in and to try to live
[1:11:42] that's true
[1:11:43] with mediocrity.
[1:11:44] There it is right there.
[1:11:46] Amen.
[1:11:46] Are we together?
[1:11:48] So the husband is dead.
[1:11:51] So
[1:11:52] after all the crying everything is
[1:11:54] finished. So the figure had to live a
[1:11:58] new life of women with a husband.
[1:12:03] So they created their own clicks.
[1:12:06] I'm just going slowly. This is my way of
[1:12:08] preaching. Okay.
[1:12:09] Okay.
[1:12:11] Opa widow
[1:12:14] Naomi widow. Rof widow. So we understand
[1:12:17] one another.
[1:12:19] They have their own phone call. They
[1:12:21] created the WhatsApp chat.
[1:12:26] The word made flesh, my friend.
[1:12:29] I'm trying to make a point.
[1:12:30] Are we together?
[1:12:32] Are we together?
[1:12:33] So, they understand one another better
[1:12:35] and they created a comfort zone.
[1:12:38] There it is right there, brother.
[1:12:39] That they know how to live
[1:12:41] as we do.
[1:12:44] Are we together?
[1:12:45] But that was not God purpose
[1:12:48] for roof.
[1:12:51] Amen.
[1:12:52] Amen.
[1:12:53] Are we together? Amen.
[1:12:54] Are we together?
[1:12:55] Then God begin to bless Israel.
[1:12:58] You know the story.
[1:13:00] When God begin to bless Israel, he begin
[1:13:03] to pull Naomi.
[1:13:05] In other words, God begin to disrupt.
[1:13:07] That's it.
[1:13:08] This new zone
[1:13:11] that they have created in their home.
[1:13:15] We were already fine. We were already
[1:13:18] living. We said we will stay like this.
[1:13:21] We will live with our mother-in-law
[1:13:23] until we die and God come and begin to
[1:13:26] shake the nest.
[1:13:28] What is going on again? Naomi wake up.
[1:13:31] He say
[1:13:32] I'm going back.
[1:13:34] Ah, we stuck with you so that you stay
[1:13:37] with us here and we will live with you
[1:13:39] together. I'm going back.
[1:13:44] Going back where? I'm going to Israel.
[1:13:49] My mama here, my brother here, my whole
[1:13:54] family here. Now the decision is big.
[1:13:57] Yes, it is.
[1:13:58] You know what?
[1:14:00] Let me pull myself. Let's go. Let's go.
[1:14:03] Let's go. So God sometime pushes you
[1:14:08] into hard situation
[1:14:10] situations
[1:14:11] to make certain uncomfortable decisions.
[1:14:19] It's a decision that is moving you from
[1:14:21] a comfort zone.
[1:14:23] Lord,
[1:14:25] you already got settled and got used. I
[1:14:28] know my neighbor. I know this one. I
[1:14:29] know this one. Now I have to move.
[1:14:32] Now I need to get a U-Haul.
[1:14:36] Now I need to change my mailbox at the
[1:14:38] post office. I have to change my mailbox
[1:14:41] with the bank. I have to change my
[1:14:43] mailbox with my mortgage. I have to
[1:14:44] change everything. It is God that is
[1:14:46] shaking you.
[1:14:48] [Applause]
[1:14:50] Glory, glory.
[1:14:51] Are we together?
[1:14:52] Now she have to make a decision.
[1:14:55] A tough one.
[1:14:56] Tough one.
[1:14:57] She have to renounce her family.
[1:15:00] Glory. Glory. Glory.
[1:15:03] Are we together? She have to renounce
[1:15:06] her own nation
[1:15:07] and she have to even renounce her
[1:15:10] religion.
[1:15:12] But that decision was better
[1:15:15] because there was a scripture that need
[1:15:18] to be bypassed
[1:15:21] it took that pressure
[1:15:23] to make her bypass the scripture.
[1:15:26] Yes sir.
[1:15:27] Because if she didn't make that decision
[1:15:30] that scripture of a Moabat would block
[1:15:32] her
[1:15:33] but she enter Israel as a moabat in a
[1:15:37] body but not a moabat inside. He said
[1:15:41] she was a Jew
[1:15:42] because she even say where you die I die
[1:15:46] and where you are buried.
[1:15:48] In other words, don't bury me over
[1:15:50] there. A woman claiming a burial in the
[1:15:53] promised land like Joseph,
[1:15:56] like Abraham,
[1:15:58] like Job, like Jacob, all of them. In
[1:16:01] other words, I'm already identified. I
[1:16:04] will be at the resurrection.
[1:16:06] [Applause]
[1:16:08] Resurrection.
[1:16:12] Are we together?
[1:16:14] Are we together?
[1:16:15] Are we together?
[1:16:17] The scripture existed first.
[1:16:20] Yes.
[1:16:20] But Ruth didn't match the scripture.
[1:16:24] So God moved in a season.
[1:16:27] Amen.
[1:16:29] The season of trial. Right.
[1:16:31] And in that season in trial, he was
[1:16:34] pruning roof,
[1:16:36] removing what need to be removed
[1:16:38] so that roof can fit the scripture.
[1:16:42] So that when Rof is coming to Israel,
[1:16:44] she can lock as a stranger,
[1:16:47] lock as a poor, lock as a widow.
[1:16:50] And with three or two scripture,
[1:16:54] no word can be broken.
[1:16:57] With two or three scripture,
[1:16:59] there is no no word.
[1:17:01] When you have two or three witnesses,
[1:17:03] the game is over.
[1:17:06] Are we together?
[1:17:07] Are you a poor? Yes, I am. Are you a
[1:17:09] stranger? Yes, I am. Are you a widow?
[1:17:12] Yes, I am, sir.
[1:17:16] Are we together?
[1:17:17] Are we together?
[1:17:18] Are we together? And if you complicate
[1:17:21] her and she wait too long, a news can
[1:17:23] come from her family that her father
[1:17:26] passed away.
[1:17:27] Yes, sir.
[1:17:28] Amen.
[1:17:28] And if her father pass away, she meet
[1:17:30] again more the criteria.
[1:17:33] But it won't happen. Are we together?
[1:17:35] Are we together? What I'm trying to show
[1:17:37] you is the providence gave the
[1:17:40] scripture. Then she went through the
[1:17:42] trial.
[1:17:43] And the trial was pruning root,
[1:17:47] preparing root. Amen.
[1:17:49] To match the oncoming season.
[1:17:56] Amen.
[1:17:56] The tri was preparing roof toward the
[1:17:59] harvest.
[1:18:02] Amen.
[1:18:03] Are we together?
[1:18:06] Let's go to Ruth one verse uh 20.
[1:18:12] Amen.
[1:18:13] This is Naomi. And Naomi says verse 20.
[1:18:18] And she said to them, "Call me not
[1:18:20] Naomi. Call me who?"
[1:18:22] Mar,
[1:18:23] "For the Almighty has dealt very
[1:18:26] bitterly with me.
[1:18:28] I went out how
[1:18:29] full."
[1:18:30] In other words, I left Israel rich.
[1:18:33] Amen. And the Lord has brought me home
[1:18:35] again. How?
[1:18:36] Empty.
[1:18:37] So I came how?
[1:18:38] Poor.
[1:18:39] Poor. And poor is a qualification.
[1:18:44] If you came rich, you don't qualify.
[1:18:46] Wow.
[1:18:47] Are we together? I came up poor. Amen.
[1:18:50] Empty. Why then call you me Naomi?
[1:18:54] Seeing the Lord has testified against me
[1:18:57] and the Almighty has afflicted me. So
[1:18:59] Naomi returned and who?
[1:19:02] And Ruth the Moabitis,
[1:19:03] her daughter-in-law with her, which
[1:19:06] returned out of the country of Moab. And
[1:19:09] they came to where?
[1:19:10] Bethlehem.
[1:19:11] Look at the way Look at where Ruth went.
[1:19:14] Uhhuh.
[1:19:14] Look at the place she went. Yes sir.
[1:19:16] Where?
[1:19:17] Bethlehem.
[1:19:17] You know what happened in Bethlehem?
[1:19:19] Yes.
[1:19:19] A Moabat going to Bethlehem.
[1:19:24] In Bethlehem when in the beginning of
[1:19:28] the barley water.
[1:19:30] So God brought her. You understand this
[1:19:32] from last Sunday. God brought her where?
[1:19:34] Right at the beginning.
[1:19:36] So that she in other word roof is
[1:19:38] blending.
[1:19:40] God ting blend everything together.
[1:19:43] Yes it does. In other words, it looks
[1:19:44] like God was working everything to match
[1:19:48] the perfect time.
[1:19:49] So if harvest started on the 1st, on the
[1:19:53] 29th or on the 30th, roof is already
[1:19:56] right there.
[1:19:56] That's right. Yes, sir.
[1:19:57] And maybe Rof wonder why did we came
[1:19:59] today on the 20th? Did it know that God
[1:20:02] is now providing?
[1:20:06] Are we together?
[1:20:07] Amen.
[1:20:08] Are we together?
[1:20:08] Amen.
[1:20:09] Let's look at this providence before we
[1:20:11] start preaching. Amen. Let's go to
[1:20:13] chapter 3 verse one. Chapter 2 verse
[1:20:16] one. If you dare, you can say amen.
[1:20:18] Amen.
[1:20:19] The Bible say, "And Naomi had a kingsman
[1:20:22] of her husband, a mighty man of what?
[1:20:25] Wealth.
[1:20:26] A rich man of the family of a Limc. And
[1:20:29] his name was what? Boaz."
[1:20:30] Remember, he was a single man,
[1:20:33] a grownup man, full of money, no wife.
[1:20:38] For some reason, God was locking this
[1:20:40] boy. Amen.
[1:20:43] He was too busy with his business
[1:20:46] that he doesn't see any sisters.
[1:20:50] But she but he had employee sisters.
[1:20:53] I'm going to show you.
[1:20:55] Don't worry. Don't worry, my friend.
[1:20:58] Ah,
[1:20:59] please help me. So, we move. Verse two.
[1:21:01] And Rof the Moab said to Naomi, if you
[1:21:04] notice, it's not Naomi who said go. You
[1:21:06] remember this? Rof herself woke up and
[1:21:09] said
[1:21:10] why am I sitting here doing nothing?
[1:21:12] This is the harvest.
[1:21:14] I remember Naomi telling me in the
[1:21:16] harvest if you a widow if you poor if
[1:21:19] you a stranger you have a right to go
[1:21:21] into the field
[1:21:22] and get free food DSS Medicaid for free
[1:21:27] provided by God.
[1:21:29] I'm saying this so you understand. Amen.
[1:21:33] America was founded by the forefather
[1:21:36] who were Christian.
[1:21:37] Are we together?
[1:21:38] And Ruth the Moab say to Naomi, "Let me
[1:21:41] now go to the field and glean ear corn
[1:21:44] after him of whose sight I shall find
[1:21:46] water."
[1:21:47] Grace.
[1:21:47] So Rof is going depending on the grace
[1:21:51] of the owner.
[1:21:54] Yes.
[1:21:55] Ruth is going depending on the grace of
[1:21:59] the owner. In other word, even though
[1:22:02] ROF knows it's a right, she still have
[1:22:05] complex
[1:22:08] that maybe if I get there, the owner
[1:22:10] will say, "You
[1:22:12] get out of my property."
[1:22:15] So, I need to find grace. I need to go
[1:22:17] through somebody who will accept me.
[1:22:19] Are we together?
[1:22:20] Are we together?
[1:22:21] Amen.
[1:22:22] Are we together?
[1:22:23] Amen.
[1:22:25] If you want to if you need to if you
[1:22:27] want to understand this, drop to verse
[1:22:29] uh uh uh six. This is the chief reaper
[1:22:32] who is explaining this. He said, "The
[1:22:34] servant that was set over the reapers,
[1:22:36] the chief reaper answered and said, "It
[1:22:39] is the Moabish dmsel that came back with
[1:22:42] Naomi out of the country of Moab." And
[1:22:44] she said
[1:22:46] to the chief reaper,
[1:22:48] I won't get into that. We already got
[1:22:49] into that. This is a different type of
[1:22:51] stuff. Amen. She said, "I pray you."
[1:22:54] Look how she's pray. She's asking, "I
[1:22:56] pray you, let me glean and gather after
[1:22:59] the reaper among the sheavs." So she
[1:23:02] came and has continued even from the
[1:23:04] morning until now that she tried a
[1:23:07] leader in the house. In other words,
[1:23:09] when she got there, she saw the chief
[1:23:11] reaper
[1:23:12] and she asked permission
[1:23:14] from the chief reaper and the chief
[1:23:16] reaper let her go. So she was working by
[1:23:19] permission. Amen.
[1:23:24] Are we together?
[1:23:25] Amen.
[1:23:25] All right. Let's go back to verse two.
[1:23:27] And Ruth the Moab said to Naomi, "Let me
[1:23:30] now go to the field and glean ear corn
[1:23:32] after him of whose sat I shall find
[1:23:34] grace." And she said to her, "Go, my
[1:23:37] daughter." Verse three. And she went and
[1:23:39] came and glean in the field after the
[1:23:42] reaper. And her hap, you know what he
[1:23:44] means, right? She happened. her was to
[1:23:47] light on the part of the field belonging
[1:23:50] to Boaz who was a kindred to who you
[1:23:54] understand this from last Sunday that's
[1:23:56] the footstep of the righteous are
[1:23:58] ordered by who
[1:23:59] the Lord
[1:24:00] so what we taught because they told her
[1:24:03] Naomi said there is no more husband in
[1:24:04] me
[1:24:05] even if I get married tonight and I have
[1:24:07] a baby you won't wait for them
[1:24:08] right
[1:24:09] are we together
[1:24:10] so there was no hope for marriage
[1:24:12] but for some reason
[1:24:15] according to Leviticus and according to
[1:24:17] Deuteronomy, God provided only food.
[1:24:23] Amen.
[1:24:26] Are we together?
[1:24:27] Only the bare necessity.
[1:24:29] That's correct.
[1:24:31] Are we together?
[1:24:32] But in the case of roof, it's different.
[1:24:36] We begin to find that God is going
[1:24:39] beyond food.
[1:24:41] That's right. Amen.
[1:24:43] God is directing roof toward a field
[1:24:47] that belong to a rich single man
[1:24:50] and not just a rich but connected by
[1:24:53] bloodland
[1:24:55] to her mother-in-law.
[1:24:58] And the laws of redemption are already
[1:25:00] in existence before Ruth get there. In
[1:25:04] other word, God begin to activate
[1:25:07] another scripture,
[1:25:09] the scripture of redemption.
[1:25:13] Are we together?
[1:25:15] All of these have nothing to do with
[1:25:17] roof.
[1:25:21] The first time ROF is going, she landed
[1:25:24] in that field.
[1:25:26] Nobody gave her the address.
[1:25:28] She had this GPS.
[1:25:32] Are we together? Amen.
[1:25:34] Are we together?
[1:25:35] Amen.
[1:25:35] So this
[1:25:37] season here that roof entering provided
[1:25:41] the law of redemption.
[1:25:44] Amen.
[1:25:46] And provided a husband.
[1:25:50] Amen.
[1:25:51] Let's see what happened again in this
[1:25:54] law. Amen.
[1:25:55] Drop to verse uh 8
[1:25:59] if you can.
[1:26:01] The Bible say then say Boaz Boaz came to
[1:26:04] Ruth hear you now not my daughter
[1:26:09] go not
[1:26:10] to glean in another field.
[1:26:13] At the beginning ROF was going trying to
[1:26:16] find a field
[1:26:18] that will give her grace.
[1:26:21] Are we together?
[1:26:22] She found one.
[1:26:24] So technically she need to go back and
[1:26:26] tomorrow she need to search for another
[1:26:28] one. But Boaz removed that uncertainty.
[1:26:34] Are we together? Boaz said, "When you
[1:26:37] come again, don't go anywhere."
[1:26:40] In other word, God begin to provide an
[1:26:44] assurance of a paycheck.
[1:26:46] [Music]
[1:26:52] Amen.
[1:26:53] Yes, sir.
[1:26:54] Don't worry, my friend. an assurance of
[1:26:57] a field.
[1:26:58] Let me use your word, a field.
[1:27:01] Amen. Verse eight. Then say Boaz to
[1:27:04] roof, hear you not my daughter. Go not
[1:27:07] to glean in another field, neither go
[1:27:10] from here, but abide here fast by who?
[1:27:13] My baby.
[1:27:14] In other words, stay with my employees.
[1:27:19] Those employees were women.
[1:27:20] That's right.
[1:27:22] He had a bunch of women there, but he
[1:27:24] was still single.
[1:27:31] Oh, he was blinded to those women.
[1:27:36] But when ROF is coming, he said, Rof,
[1:27:39] you know what? Identify yourself with my
[1:27:42] employee.
[1:27:47] In other words, you found yourself a
[1:27:48] job. Amen.
[1:27:50] Amen.
[1:27:51] But your job you not working to pay to
[1:27:54] be paid. You are working for yourself.
[1:27:56] Amen.
[1:27:57] Amen.
[1:28:01] The the maiden are reaping for me. You
[1:28:04] are not reaping for me. You are reaping
[1:28:06] for yourself.
[1:28:08] In other words, God begin to provide
[1:28:11] beyond
[1:28:14] what the scripture says right here.
[1:28:17] Why? because he was the season.
[1:28:21] I hope we are together.
[1:28:23] I have not start my sermon.
[1:28:25] I'm only reading the Bible.
[1:28:28] When it's the season, you don't do
[1:28:30] anything.
[1:28:34] Are we together?
[1:28:35] Remember, I have not start preaching
[1:28:37] yet.
[1:28:41] Are we together?
[1:28:42] Are we together?
[1:28:44] When I start preaching, then you put 45
[1:28:46] minutes. Amen.
[1:28:52] I'm reading the Bible.
[1:28:55] We got no preach.
[1:28:56] Are we together?
[1:28:58] Are we together?
[1:29:01] Okay, we on verse eight. Amen.
[1:29:04] Jump to verse N.
[1:29:06] Let your eyes be on the field. That is
[1:29:09] that they do what?
[1:29:10] Read. In other word, follow the maiden
[1:29:14] because the maiden knows the property of
[1:29:16] Boaz. The maiden knows that we got a
[1:29:20] field here. When we finish, we will go
[1:29:22] there. Roof doesn't know
[1:29:24] what belong to Boaz.
[1:29:27] So they gave her a guide,
[1:29:30] a GPS.
[1:29:32] Wow.
[1:29:32] Stay by the women. The women knows
[1:29:35] wherever you see them moving, just
[1:29:37] follow them.
[1:29:39] Amen.
[1:29:39] Amen. Amen.
[1:29:40] Are we together?
[1:29:41] Amen.
[1:29:41] Are we together?
[1:29:42] Amen.
[1:29:42] So, there were women. It's a woman
[1:29:45] following woman.
[1:29:47] Amen.
[1:29:48] It's a woman that was following women
[1:29:52] and the women were following the wheat.
[1:29:58] The women were going after food
[1:30:02] and roof have to follow the women that
[1:30:05] are following the food.
[1:30:06] Amen. Amen. Let me start it again.
[1:30:10] The maiden of Boaz knows where the food
[1:30:14] is.
[1:30:15] Rof doesn't know where the food is.
[1:30:18] But in order for ROF to know where the
[1:30:20] food is, ROF have to stay behind
[1:30:24] the women that are following the food.
[1:30:28] ROF was a fish.
[1:30:32] She have to follow the little fishes
[1:30:35] that are following the food.
[1:30:38] That is the key of the ministry of
[1:30:40] brother.
[1:30:42] The rainbow trout
[1:30:44] was supposed to follow.
[1:30:47] They are the fishes
[1:30:49] that are following the Lord.
[1:30:54] I don't know if we together.
[1:30:58] Brother vision is perfectly with the
[1:31:00] word.
[1:31:01] God told brother Brandham, "Let me teach
[1:31:04] you how to catch." Because brother Brham
[1:31:06] went somewhere. Amen.
[1:31:08] Now I'm preaching something different.
[1:31:09] Brother Brandham went somewhere, God
[1:31:11] took him to a vision to a big pond.
[1:31:14] And when brother Brandham watched, there
[1:31:16] were big fishes
[1:31:17] and small fishes. And the big fishes has
[1:31:19] a rainbow
[1:31:20] which means a covenant
[1:31:23] and and they were preacher around.
[1:31:25] Brother Brham
[1:31:26] and all the preacher were fishing but
[1:31:28] they were catching only
[1:31:32] the maiden.
[1:31:33] Yes.
[1:31:34] Only the maiden. But when brother
[1:31:36] Brandham came, brother Brandham said,
[1:31:37] "Wait a minute. I just love that rainbow
[1:31:39] trout fish."
[1:31:41] And the angel of the Lord told him, "I'm
[1:31:44] going to teach you how to catch those."
[1:31:50] Are we together?
[1:31:51] Are we together? The way you catch those
[1:31:54] is number one, you put you take your
[1:31:57] bait
[1:31:58] and you put the lure in the bait.
[1:32:00] And that's the first pool.
[1:32:02] The first pool.
[1:32:03] Hallelujah. Are we together?
[1:32:05] Which is divine healing.
[1:32:07] And the angel say you throw that in the
[1:32:10] water.
[1:32:11] And when you throw that in the water,
[1:32:13] the rainbow tr won't see it.
[1:32:20] Are we following me?
[1:32:22] Brother say it will be the little fishes
[1:32:25] that will run after it.
[1:32:28] They will run after divine healing.
[1:32:30] They're always going where healing is
[1:32:32] quickly. Yes.
[1:32:35] [Music]
[1:32:38] Are we together?
[1:32:39] They will be in a healing convention.
[1:32:44] Amen.
[1:32:45] Are we together?
[1:32:46] And brother Brandham say when they begin
[1:32:48] to bite the bait,
[1:32:50] the angel of the Lord said, "Move the
[1:32:52] lure."
[1:32:53] In other words, push the food away from
[1:32:56] them.
[1:32:56] Amen.
[1:32:57] Are you together?
[1:32:58] When you move the lure, the lure of
[1:33:00] fishes will begin to follow the lure.
[1:33:03] Amen.
[1:33:03] Are you following me?
[1:33:05] And as they are following the rule, they
[1:33:07] begin to create movement
[1:33:11] and that movement will go as a wave
[1:33:15] and touch the rainbow trap.
[1:33:18] And now the rainbow th will begin to
[1:33:20] follow the little fishes
[1:33:22] that are following the food. That's why
[1:33:25] Boas say behind the m
[1:33:28] because this is a big catch. roof was a
[1:33:32] rainbow truck and Boaz was crushed
[1:33:36] and the redeemer was pulling.
[1:33:41] Are we together? Are we together?
[1:33:44] Are we together? It is a fishing
[1:33:47] technique.
[1:33:48] In other words, to catch roof, you can't
[1:33:51] catch her like this. Put her behind the
[1:33:54] m
[1:33:55] and begin to move the food.
[1:34:00] Are we together?
[1:34:01] And brother Brham say when they begin to
[1:34:04] come on the second time, he say pull
[1:34:06] that.
[1:34:08] He say you will see the little fishes
[1:34:10] begin to scatter.
[1:34:14] Do you follow me?
[1:34:16] Do you follow me?
[1:34:17] When they begin to scatter,
[1:34:20] then the big rainbow
[1:34:22] is now alone.
[1:34:24] Amen.
[1:34:24] Facing the lure.
[1:34:25] Yes sir. Brother Brandham say now the
[1:34:28] angel say now prepare for the catch
[1:34:31] because now it's the third pool.
[1:34:36] It is the opening of the word.
[1:34:39] Now open up the word
[1:34:41] because that fish love the opening of
[1:34:44] the word.
[1:34:47] [Applause]
[1:34:52] [Music]
[1:34:53] Are we together? I'm still reading my
[1:34:55] Bible.

[1:35:15] Why didn't Boas just say, "You know
[1:35:17] what? I love you. Let me marry you."
[1:35:19] Brother Brandham got a message.
[1:35:21] God have to put a type.
[1:35:25] to vindicate brother Brana message.
[1:35:28] You who are fighting with brother Brana.
[1:35:30] If you don't know anything, shut up.
[1:35:34] You don't fight with a vindicated
[1:35:36] prophet.
[1:35:38] This message is right.
[1:35:40] It is 100%
[1:35:43] blended with the Bible.
[1:35:45] [Applause]
[1:35:49] You're using your memory, your reasoning
[1:35:52] with the word of God.
[1:35:54] This word is understood by revelation.
[1:36:00] Are we together?
[1:36:02] Are we together?

[1:36:24] That's where the catch is. On the field
[1:36:26] that they do reap and go you after them.

[1:36:46] protection.
[1:36:48] [Applause]
[1:36:49] [Music]
[1:36:52] Boaz provided protection
[1:36:55] against abuse
[1:36:58] and sexual harassment.

[1:37:03] On the job.
[1:37:04] Do not harass this one.

[1:38:14] morning?
[1:38:15] [Applause]
[1:38:19] Did you work for it?
[1:38:21] Did you put this rod?
[1:38:22] No.
[1:38:23] It's a season.
[1:38:25] [Applause]
[1:38:27] God provided the drink
[1:38:31] without work.
[1:38:34] [Music]
[1:38:35] Without even money,
[1:38:37] no dollar,

[1:39:01] you here.
[1:39:03] And eat of the bread.
[1:39:06] This is not the wheat now. This is the
[1:39:08] wheat in
[1:39:08] morph.
[1:39:10] So somebody cooked.
[1:39:11] That's right.
[1:39:12] And bring the meal for the boss.

[1:40:28] So who gave her food?
[1:40:30] Boaz.
[1:40:31] Who serve Ruth?
[1:40:33] Boaz.
[1:40:33] How can you serve a widow woman?
[1:40:35] Hallelujah.
[1:40:36] An employee.
[1:40:38] And serve Rof. And she did eat and was

[1:40:50] That she didn't cook.
[1:40:54] All of this because of the harvest.
[1:40:57] [Applause]
[1:40:58] I I I don't know if you're
[1:40:59] understanding.
[1:41:01] But this food was also free for Naomi.
[1:41:07] So Ruth got two type of food.
[1:41:10] Uncooked.
[1:41:12] That's right.
[1:41:12] The one she was reaping
[1:41:14] and the cooked one.
[1:41:16] Amen.
[1:41:17] Two food. Amen.
[1:41:18] In other words, they give you rice and a
[1:41:20] bag of rice.
[1:41:22] So when ROF is going home, she got a
[1:41:24] to-go box
[1:41:25] and she got a rice.
[1:41:27] Do you know that ROF took a to go box?
[1:41:30] Do you know that?
[1:41:31] Do you know that?
[1:41:33] No, a few people. Let me show you.
[1:41:35] Uh job to verse 18.
[1:41:39] And she took it up and went into the
[1:41:41] city. And her mother-in-law saw what she
[1:41:44] had water
[1:41:45] clean.
[1:41:45] This is the bag of rice. And she brought
[1:41:47] forth and gave to her that she had
[1:41:51] reserve after she was water.
[1:41:53] Suffice.
[1:41:54] So Rof took a to go box.
[1:41:56] So now Naomi don't have to cook.
[1:42:02] Rof don't have to cook. Naomi don't have
[1:42:04] to cook. When Rof goes to work, she get
[1:42:07] lunch
[1:42:08] and she divide the lunch in two. She eat
[1:42:12] until she's full and she take the
[1:42:14] remaining of the L and say mommy.
[1:42:17] [Music]
[1:42:21] Why the beginning of harvest?
[1:42:24] Are we together?
[1:42:25] Amen.
[1:42:25] Are we together?
[1:42:26] Amen.
[1:42:27] Are we together?
[1:42:28] Amen.
[1:42:28] Jump to verse 16, my friend,
[1:42:31] and then I'm going to finish my
[1:42:32] scripture.
[1:42:34] Uh go to verse 15. You there?
[1:42:36] Amen.
[1:42:37] Remember at the beginning Ruth asked for
[1:42:39] permission. Yes.
[1:42:41] Right.
[1:42:42] Verse 15. And when she was risen up to
[1:42:44] do what?
[1:42:45] Glean.
[1:42:46] Boaz commanded.
[1:42:49] It's a command. Who?
[1:42:50] His young men.
[1:42:52] Saying what?
[1:42:53] Let her glean even among the sheep.
[1:42:55] And do what?
[1:42:56] And reproach her not.
[1:42:57] At the beginning she was asking for
[1:42:59] permission. Now the permission was
[1:43:02] removed.
[1:43:03] Amen.
[1:43:04] Amen.
[1:43:05] Boaz remove the permission.
[1:43:08] need of permission.
[1:43:11] In other words, tomorrow when ROF is
[1:43:13] coming, she's asking who?
[1:43:15] Nobody.
[1:43:17] Nobody.
[1:43:18] Nobody.
[1:43:19] She just get into the field.
[1:43:22] Amen.
[1:43:24] Are we together?
[1:43:26] She's not gleaning for
[1:43:27] Boas.
[1:43:29] She's gleaning for herself.
[1:43:31] We clear, my friend.
[1:43:32] Amen.
[1:43:33] Verse 16. And let fall also some of
[1:43:36] what? the handfuls
[1:43:38] of what?
[1:43:39] Of purpose for her
[1:43:40] and leave them that she may do what?
[1:43:42] Glean them
[1:43:43] and do what?
[1:43:43] Rebuke her not.
[1:43:44] So God he begin to provide even what?
[1:43:48] Intentional food.
[1:43:50] [Music]
[1:43:54] Why is this thing happening just like
[1:43:56] that? All of this for free.
[1:44:01] In other words, she's cleaning. This is
[1:44:04] what God provided
[1:44:06] for everybody. But when it's roof, if
[1:44:10] you see another widow gleaning, let her
[1:44:12] glean. But if you see roof gleaning,
[1:44:14] make ROF understand that she's not like
[1:44:17] everybody.
[1:44:20] Make ROF understand that she's special.
[1:44:25] Amen.
[1:44:25] In other words, as roof is gleaning,
[1:44:29] are you following me?
[1:44:30] Food are falling again on her.
[1:44:35] I don't know if you get it.
[1:44:37] She's cleaning food and then poom.
[1:44:41] Amen.
[1:44:42] She tried to clean.
[1:44:47] She got the normal food
[1:44:49] and she got the food of the day.
[1:44:53] The reveal food of the day.
[1:44:56] It revealed daily.
[1:44:58] It revealed every Wednesday.
[1:45:00] It is revealed every Sunday. Amen.
[1:45:05] She can read her Bible,
[1:45:07] but there are also foods that are coming
[1:45:09] that spiritually speaking. But God is
[1:45:11] giving exceedingly and abundantly beyond
[1:45:15] what you can ask and think.
[1:45:18] Amen.
[1:45:19] Amen.
[1:45:20] Are we together?
[1:45:21] Amen.
[1:45:21] Are we together?
[1:45:22] Amen.
[1:45:23] Job 2 verse 23.
[1:45:26] Lord help me with the reading of the
[1:45:28] scripture. You there?
[1:45:30] Amen. So she kept fast by who?
[1:45:32] The maidens.
[1:45:34] The maidens of Boaz.
[1:45:36] She kept how
[1:45:37] fast.
[1:45:38] So if you want to see Rof, where what do
[1:45:40] you need?
[1:45:42] If they ask you where is roof
[1:45:44] and you're trying to find her, what do
[1:45:46] you need for indicator?
[1:45:48] If you see the maiden, you see roof.
[1:45:50] If you see the maiden, you see roof.
[1:45:52] If you see the maiden, you see roof.
[1:45:54] So she became mingle with the maiden.
[1:45:56] Uhhuh.
[1:45:57] Until she became part of the maiden.
[1:45:59] Amen. until you cannot tell the
[1:46:01] difference
[1:46:03] between the maiden and roof
[1:46:05] because she's acting like the maiden.
[1:46:08] She's behaving like the maiden. She's
[1:46:10] following the maiden. But she was
[1:46:12] intended for marriage.
[1:46:15] So another season have to come.
[1:46:17] That's right.
[1:46:18] To separate Ruth
[1:46:20] from the maiden.
[1:46:25] [Music]
[1:46:26] I have not started preaching my friend.
[1:46:29] Let's go to verse 23. So she kept fast
[1:46:32] by the maiden of Boaz to glean to the
[1:46:35] water
[1:46:36] and of barley harvest
[1:46:37] and of water
[1:46:38] wheat harvest
[1:46:39] and dwell with her water
[1:46:40] mother-in-law.
[1:46:41] In other words, there was a season of a
[1:46:43] harvest
[1:46:44] and ROF completed the harvest of wheat
[1:46:47] and the harvest of barley until the
[1:46:49] harvest is finished. Are we together?
[1:46:52] During that season, Ruth and the maiden
[1:46:56] were together.
[1:46:58] Amen. Amen.
[1:47:00] But the time another season have to come
[1:47:03] to separate Ruth
[1:47:05] from the mountain.
[1:47:08] Amen.
[1:47:08] Are we together?
[1:47:09] Amen.
[1:47:10] Chapter 3 verse one.
[1:47:12] Amen.
[1:47:13] Then Naomi her mother-in-law said to
[1:47:15] her, "My daughter, shall I not seek
[1:47:18] water?
[1:47:19] Rest for thee
[1:47:20] that I may be water
[1:47:21] well with thee." And now is not Boaz our
[1:47:25] kindred of our kindred with whose what
[1:47:28] maidens thou was?
[1:47:31] That was your identity. Behold, he does
[1:47:34] what?
[1:47:34] He winnoweth
[1:47:35] what?
[1:47:36] Barley
[1:47:36] tonight where
[1:47:37] in the threshing floor.
[1:47:38] In other words, the season of a harvest
[1:47:41] is finished.
[1:47:42] And now the season open up which is the
[1:47:46] season of the threshing.
[1:47:47] Amen.
[1:47:48] Follow me my friend.
[1:47:50] Amen. What happened in the tracing?
[1:47:55] The tracing is when the wheat is
[1:47:58] harvest,
[1:47:59] the wheat comes with the shack
[1:48:03] which is the covering.
[1:48:06] But we don't eat shack.
[1:48:08] We eat the grain.
[1:48:12] So the tracing floor
[1:48:14] separate the shack
[1:48:16] from the seed.
[1:48:18] Are we together? And Naomi say now it's
[1:48:22] time for you to go not in the field
[1:48:24] but in the trenching flow. In other
[1:48:27] words, roof must be separated from the
[1:48:29] maiden.
[1:48:31] Boaz will not marry the maiden.
[1:48:34] He will not marry the shark.
[1:48:37] But he want roof.
[1:48:39] So the season come to separate roof
[1:48:42] from the maiden. Naturally speaking,
[1:48:46] they are separating the shack which is
[1:48:48] denomination from the message. But
[1:48:50] spiritually speaking, they are
[1:48:52] separating the maiden from roof.
[1:48:55] Because Boaz is interested only in roof.
[1:49:01] Amen.
[1:49:02] Amen.
[1:49:03] Are we together?
[1:49:04] Amen.
[1:49:04] Are we together?
[1:49:05] Amen.
[1:49:05] Are we together?
[1:49:06] Amen.
[1:49:07] So there was a season of preparation.
[1:49:09] Amen.
[1:49:10] There was a season of gleaning
[1:49:15] and there was another season of the
[1:49:17] trenching.
[1:49:18] Are we together?
[1:49:20] And the treing was to separate. And if
[1:49:22] you notice, she was the only one.
[1:49:24] Only one.
[1:49:26] No more obeen.
[1:49:28] When Boaz rose up, he say a woman here.
[1:49:33] Who's this woman?
[1:49:34] The only one. He looked it was roof.
[1:49:38] Hallelujah.
[1:49:40] Are we together?
[1:49:41] Are we together?
[1:49:42] When they talk, do you know what
[1:49:43] happened?
[1:49:45] Boaz say
[1:49:48] you were coming with a veil.
[1:49:51] You know that.
[1:49:52] You came with a veil.
[1:49:54] A veil. Remove the veil.
[1:50:00] Are we together?
[1:50:01] Hold the veil.
[1:50:03] And Boaz himself.
[1:50:05] No more the greener. Boaz himself. He
[1:50:08] goes one.
[1:50:09] That's right.
[1:50:10] That's right.
[1:50:11] Continue.
[1:50:12] Three.
[1:50:12] Four. And he stop at which number?
[1:50:15] Six.
[1:50:15] Six.
[1:50:17] Why did he stop at six?
[1:50:21] Are we together?
[1:50:22] He only give one, two, three, four. When
[1:50:24] he six, he finish. He closed.
[1:50:27] Come on, brother.
[1:50:28] Because the seventh one is myself.
[1:50:31] Amen.
[1:50:33] Amen. Yes.
[1:50:35] Six is the number of a man.
[1:50:39] Are we together? Six is the number of a
[1:50:42] man
[1:50:43] and the man is Boaz himself.
[1:50:45] So when Boaz is coming is to complete
[1:50:48] to marry Ruth.
[1:50:52] [Applause]
[1:50:56] Are we together?
[1:50:58] Are we together? So the life of Ruth has
[1:51:01] season.
[1:51:04] Amen.
[1:51:07] Let's start our sermon now. Turn your
[1:51:09] clock for 45 minutes.
[1:51:16] Are we together?
[1:51:18] Are we together?
[1:51:19] We found out that according to
[1:51:21] Ecclesiastes.
[1:51:22] Amen.
[1:51:24] [Laughter]
[1:51:26] We found out to everything there is
[1:51:28] what?
[1:51:29] The season. So what we say is everything
[1:51:32] got what?
[1:51:34] A season.
[1:51:34] This thing got what?
[1:51:35] A season.
[1:51:36] This one?
[1:51:37] A season.
[1:51:38] This one
[1:51:38] a season.
[1:51:39] This one.
[1:51:40] In other words, there is nothing under
[1:51:42] the sun.
[1:51:43] There is nothing in this world
[1:51:45] that don't have a season.
[1:51:47] If it didn't happen yet, maybe it's not
[1:51:50] a season yet.
[1:51:55] So if you find a season,
[1:51:57] if a season open up from today, you need
[1:52:01] to be alert.
[1:52:04] Which season am I at?
[1:52:06] That's right. There it is.
[1:52:07] What? What has God provided?
[1:52:10] That's right.
[1:52:11] For the season. Because if you lack to
[1:52:13] understand the season, you will miss
[1:52:15] your opportunity.
[1:52:16] [Applause]
[1:52:18] 100%.
[1:52:20] Amen.
[1:52:21] Are we together?
[1:52:22] Amen.
[1:52:22] ROF understood the season.
[1:52:26] Amen.
[1:52:27] Amen.
[1:52:28] And when ROF understand the season, ROF
[1:52:31] moved by the season. And God begin to
[1:52:33] open up one door after the And if you
[1:52:36] notice all those doors
[1:52:38] were not opened by roof.
[1:52:40] No sir.
[1:52:41] They were opened by by God.
[1:52:44] Because if the season come
[1:52:46] door open by themselves
[1:52:53] are we together?
[1:52:55] Are we together?
[1:52:56] So there is nothing in this world that
[1:52:59] doesn't have a season. Everything have
[1:53:02] what? A season. We clear my friend.
[1:53:05] Amen. As we moving on, we found out last
[1:53:07] Sunday that according to Genesis 1 and
[1:53:10] according to Psalm 104, those season
[1:53:14] were instituted by God.
[1:53:17] It is God who play season.
[1:53:22] You start getting quiet now. My friend,
[1:53:24] it is God who play season. It's right
[1:53:26] there. You can take a screenshot and you
[1:53:28] can read it at home because I read it
[1:53:30] last Sunday. It is God who instituted
[1:53:33] season. In other words, season
[1:53:36] amen
[1:53:37] are God's program.
[1:53:41] It is not your program.
[1:53:43] It is God himself. When he's dividing
[1:53:46] time,
[1:53:47] God begin to put season.
[1:53:49] Yes sir.
[1:53:50] Are we together?
[1:53:51] Amen. And according to Genesis 8:22,
[1:53:55] the Bible say that while the earth
[1:53:57] remain
[1:53:58] seed time and water,
[1:54:00] harvest
[1:54:01] and then water
[1:54:02] and cold
[1:54:02] and water
[1:54:03] and heat
[1:54:03] and water and summer
[1:54:04] and water and winter and water and day
[1:54:06] and water and night
[1:54:07] shall not water cease. In other word,
[1:54:10] God have a season for seed time.
[1:54:15] It's written day
[1:54:16] and there is a season for harvest. You
[1:54:19] cannot go
[1:54:21] to harvest in seed time.
[1:54:23] You will be out of season.
[1:54:26] You cannot go in the harvest and begin
[1:54:28] to plant seed.
[1:54:29] In a harvest, you are removing stuff.
[1:54:31] In other words, God for every season. He
[1:54:35] have a specific event.
[1:54:37] Amen. That's correct.
[1:54:38] That will happen.
[1:54:40] Amen.
[1:54:40] During that season,
[1:54:42] based on his own program.
[1:54:44] That's right.
[1:54:45] Are we together?
[1:54:46] Amen.
[1:54:46] Are we together?
[1:54:47] Amen. Glory to God. Hallelujah. The
[1:54:50] Bible say in the book of Deuteronomy
[1:54:53] that a land which the Lord thy God care
[1:54:56] for the eyes of the Lord that God are
[1:54:58] water
[1:54:59] always upon it
[1:55:00] from what
[1:55:01] the beginning of the year
[1:55:02] to the water
[1:55:03] the end of the year. Here we find out
[1:55:06] that Palestine or the land of Canaan,
[1:55:10] God was there from January
[1:55:14] all the way to what
[1:55:16] to December.
[1:55:18] The whole year
[1:55:20] God is dead.
[1:55:21] His eyes are there.
[1:55:23] Follow me, my friend.
[1:55:25] But the Bible say, "And it shall come to
[1:55:27] pass if you shall do what?"
[1:55:29] Hearken diligently
[1:55:31] Uhhuh. unto what?
[1:55:32] My commandments
[1:55:32] to the word of Moses. the word of the
[1:55:34] messenger of the age which I command you
[1:55:37] when
[1:55:37] this day.
[1:55:38] So you got to you got to follow the
[1:55:40] message of your day carefully.
[1:55:42] Correct, brother.
[1:55:43] Amen.
[1:55:45] Amen.
[1:55:45] Are we together?
[1:55:46] When you follow the message of your day
[1:55:49] diligently and then you love who?
[1:55:51] The Lord your God.
[1:55:52] And you do what?
[1:55:53] Serve him with all your heart.
[1:55:54] Uhhuh.
[1:55:55] And with all your soul
[1:55:56] that I will give you the rain of your
[1:55:59] land when
[1:56:00] in his due season.
[1:56:01] The first rain and the what? the latter
[1:56:03] rain
[1:56:04] that you may gather in the corn that
[1:56:06] wine and the water
[1:56:07] that oil.
[1:56:08] So even though
[1:56:10] God is in the entire year yet God
[1:56:14] doesn't send rain all along.
[1:56:18] Amen.
[1:56:20] I I hope you understanding me.
[1:56:22] If you come to America right here
[1:56:25] in the whole year we have four season.
[1:56:28] We have uh spring,
[1:56:30] we have uh summer
[1:56:33] and then we have fall and then we have
[1:56:35] what?
[1:56:36] Winter.
[1:56:36] If you notice rain doesn't fall all
[1:56:39] along.
[1:56:41] If you go to the other part of the
[1:56:42] country, you will find out that uh I
[1:56:45] mean in other continent there is a rainy
[1:56:47] season and a dry season. A dry season
[1:56:50] means there won't be any rain.
[1:56:52] Are we together? So God is saying here
[1:56:55] that in the entire year my presence is
[1:56:58] there.
[1:57:00] Amen.
[1:57:01] I hope we understanding.
[1:57:03] But even though my presence is there.
[1:57:06] Amen.
[1:57:07] I don't do anything anytime.
[1:57:11] I operate in season.
[1:57:16] Let me start it again. Put your seat
[1:57:18] belt my friend. God is saying from
[1:57:21] January to December,
[1:57:24] I am with you.
[1:57:26] I watch over you.
[1:57:28] When you in your car, I'm there.
[1:57:30] When you at work, I'm there.
[1:57:32] When you taking a shower, I'm there.
[1:57:34] When you sleeping, I'm there.
[1:57:36] When you cooking, I'm there.
[1:57:38] When you driving, I'm there.
[1:57:40] Wherever you are, I'm there.
[1:57:42] But even though I'm there,
[1:57:44] I don't do everything in any time.
[1:57:49] I do things according to my channels.
[1:57:56] [Music]
[1:57:59] What are you trying to say, brother
[1:58:01] Stephen?
[1:58:02] What God is trying to say,
[1:58:04] spoken word, visible
[1:58:07] and spoken word and visible audience
[1:58:10] from January
[1:58:11] to December. I'm in this church.
[1:58:17] When you come to the church, you will
[1:58:18] feel the anointing.
[1:58:20] You will feel the presence of God.
[1:58:23] But you will wonder why the anointing is
[1:58:26] here, but I don't get what I'm looking
[1:58:28] for.
[1:58:34] I was in church. I felt the presence of
[1:58:36] the Lord,
[1:58:38] but I'm not receiving what I'm looking
[1:58:40] for.
[1:58:42] Lord,
[1:58:45] that's it. Amen. Let me start it again.
[1:58:48] Let me start it again.
[1:58:49] God is saying that I come to spoken
[1:58:52] word. When I enter the anointing is
[1:58:55] powerful.
[1:58:58] Hallelujah.
[1:58:58] Are we together?
[1:59:00] And I came
[1:59:02] with three requests.
[1:59:05] [Music]
[1:59:09] The first request, I want to get a job.
[1:59:12] The second request, I want my child to
[1:59:14] be saved.
[1:59:15] Yes. The third one, I need healing.
[1:59:18] But when the anointing come,
[1:59:20] God only give you a job.
[1:59:23] But he's not saving your child yet.
[1:59:26] And you wonder why?
[1:59:29] Because there is a season.
[1:59:34] [Applause]
[1:59:41] I hope we are together.
[1:59:42] Amen.

[2:00:52] Yes, he is.
[2:00:54] In other words, don't look at what you
[2:00:56] see naturally.
[2:00:58] To determine whether I'm there or not.
[2:01:00] Remember my word. I am with you till the
[2:01:04] end of the earth.

[2:28:26] because you coming to God with your
[2:28:29] time.

[2:28:36] this,

[2:28:39] If it doesn't happen, you broken.
[2:28:42] Lucifer will laugh at you
[2:28:45] because you are trying to take God
[2:28:48] and fit it to him. Amen.
[2:28:50] But if you know the timing,
[2:28:55] if you know that grandma
[2:28:57] have to enter from the back door
[2:29:00] and sit in the chair,
[2:29:03] you will wait for grandma.
[2:29:06] [Applause]
[2:29:07] You know the vision once grandma enter
[2:29:10] and sit down,
[2:29:12] you can raise
[2:29:14] and move your belt
[2:29:15] and say devil call out demon from hell.
[2:29:20] Why? Because the time has come.
[2:29:23] [Applause]
[2:29:27] Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:29:29] Hallelujah.
[2:29:32] My friend, can we continue?
[2:29:34] Yes.
[2:29:34] Flat attend and prepare for landing.
[2:29:37] Because time is moving, my friend.
[2:29:39] Brother Brandham say if they try to make
[2:29:42] what?
[2:29:42] God's word.
[2:29:43] Do what?
[2:29:44] Fit in their program.
[2:29:46] But that you got it. How? vice versa.
[2:29:49] You got to fit in what?
[2:29:51] In God's program.
[2:29:52] And God has season.
[2:29:54] [Music]
[2:29:56] Can I continue?
[2:29:57] Amen.
[2:29:58] Brother Brandham says he says we found
[2:30:01] that that is what
[2:30:03] true.
[2:30:03] Now Moses when he was here
[2:30:07] knowing that God has made a promise
[2:30:10] that he was going to deliver what?
[2:30:12] The children of Israel.
[2:30:14] Why? Moses knowing
[2:30:16] that he was called
[2:30:18] for that purpose.
[2:30:20] Now when you have a call from God
[2:30:24] [Music]
[2:30:25] that does not all together means
[2:30:29] that you jump right out
[2:30:33] [Applause]
[2:30:34] [Music]
[2:30:40] Can I start it again?
[2:30:41] Amen.
[2:30:41] Can I start it again?
[2:30:43] Amen. I'm trying to maneuver the
[2:30:44] airplane. So, we going to the airport.
[2:30:46] Okay, my friend. So, keep your seat
[2:30:48] belt. Amen. You're going to feel the
[2:30:50] airplane going this way. Are we
[2:30:51] together?
[2:30:52] Brother Brandham say he says when you
[2:30:56] have a call from God.
[2:30:58] You there my friend?
[2:30:59] Yes, sir.
[2:30:59] That doesn't what?

[2:31:02] that you jump right out.
[2:31:04] You are going to you are going you are
[2:31:08] doing the will of what?
[2:31:09] God.
[2:31:10] You have to find what? the will of God
[2:31:13] and the time of God to do it.
[2:31:17] Amen.
[2:31:19] Amen.
[2:31:19] Are we together?
[2:31:20] Amen.
[2:31:21] Are we together?
[2:31:21] Amen.
[2:31:22] Brother Brandham say Moses thought
[2:31:27] I got that save the Lord. I'm the one
[2:31:28] who's going to liberate.
[2:31:30] I'm the deliverer.
[2:31:32] That's true.
[2:31:34] God gave the promise. That's true.
[2:31:36] But what time? the timing.
[2:31:39] You the one that make God look like he's
[2:31:41] failing.
[2:31:44] You are the one doing that
[2:31:46] because of the pressure.
[2:31:49] That's right.
[2:31:50] You want things to be done your way.
[2:31:55] He says Moses thought well the children
[2:31:58] of Israel will do what?
[2:32:01] Understand
[2:32:02] now
[2:32:04] that I am what? to be their deliverer.
[2:32:07] Moses is coming on the chariot.
[2:32:11] May back Mercedes to
[2:32:14] they open the door.
[2:32:16] Why you two are arguing?
[2:32:18] Don't do that to your brother.
[2:32:21] Close the door. Prince of Egypt. He say
[2:32:25] they will understand.
[2:32:28] They won't understand when you have that
[2:32:30] prince of Egypt.
[2:32:36] Amen.
[2:32:37] Because you're still too powerful.
[2:32:41] Too powerful
[2:32:43] until you beat somebody t and kill
[2:32:45] somebody.
[2:32:52] I'm going to liberate Israel.
[2:32:55] I'm killing Egyptian one by one.
[2:32:58] No, Moses.
[2:32:59] That is your strength.
[2:33:02] I want it when you speak
[2:33:05] and Egypt is trembling.
[2:33:07] Just speak the word.
[2:33:13] Hallelujah.
[2:33:15] Hallelujah.
[2:33:15] Amen.
[2:33:16] Ah my friend, brother Brandham say he
[2:33:19] taught the children of Israel with
[2:33:20] understand what
[2:33:21] now that that I'm to be their deliverer.
[2:33:23] I'm to be delivered. So he start out to
[2:33:26] do so and he did what? He killed a man
[2:33:28] and he found out the children of Israel
[2:33:30] did not understand.
[2:33:33] As a matter of fact, they say, "Hey, you
[2:33:35] know you killed the Egyptian.
[2:33:36] I will report you,
[2:33:38] so don't start with me
[2:33:45] [Laughter]
[2:33:48] in the wilderness."
[2:33:53] And guess what?
[2:33:55] I don't think this deliver things was
[2:33:57] true.
[2:33:58] It didn't work. I don't think so.
[2:34:01] You know what? I take my decision the
[2:34:03] time of my decision
[2:34:04] from now on.
[2:34:06] I'm going to leave my life. They live
[2:34:07] their life.
[2:34:09] I'm not going to be part of them.
[2:34:11] They stay there.
[2:34:12] Keep them
[2:34:14] within the cellular zone.
[2:34:20] Amen.
[2:34:22] Are we together?
[2:34:23] Amen.
[2:34:23] Amen.
[2:34:25] I'm going to find me a cool job.
[2:34:32] I found my wife.
[2:34:34] You see here, it's peaceful in the
[2:34:36] wilderness.
[2:34:38] Not the fasting of Egypt to the south.
[2:34:41] I'm cool here.
[2:34:44] How is Egypt over? Oh, my brother.
[2:34:46] That's why I move. I move from there
[2:34:49] because of the people. Chuga chuga cha
[2:34:51] cha cha cha chuga chuga. That's why I
[2:34:53] left that church.
[2:34:56] [Applause]
[2:34:58] [Music]
[2:35:03] If you look at your window, you will see
[2:35:05] Charlotte, North Carolina. The airplane
[2:35:06] is now coming down.
[2:35:08] Okay, my friend.
[2:35:09] Okay, my friend.
[2:35:10] Amen.
[2:35:11] Can we finish it?
[2:35:12] Yes, sir.
[2:35:13] Brother Brandham, what happened? He
[2:35:15] said, "Then Moses lost all the hope."
[2:35:18] That's it.
[2:35:19] And all the power he had.
[2:35:23] Amen.
[2:35:24] So there is a time you are powerful.
[2:35:27] [Music]
[2:35:29] I got a degree.
[2:35:32] [Applause]
[2:35:35] Tell us I have my PhD in that.
[2:35:39] You think doing that you're intimidating
[2:35:40] people?
[2:35:42] No job.
[2:35:46] No job.
[2:35:46] Too much power.
[2:35:48] Amen.
[2:35:50] In an interview, you are even blowing
[2:35:52] the interviewer.
[2:35:54] I'm mesmerized by your presence here.
[2:35:57] You know, subsequently,
[2:36:05] too much power,
[2:36:06] too much.
[2:36:07] Can I continue?
[2:36:08] Can I continue? I'm heading straight
[2:36:10] toward the airport, my friend. He says
[2:36:13] thinking that freedom was not for the
[2:36:15] children of Israel
[2:36:17] because he fell.
[2:36:18] He begin to doubt the promise.
[2:36:21] Amen. He had lost all thoughts of p of
[2:36:24] freedom
[2:36:25] until
[2:36:28] God met him one day.
[2:36:31] And brother Brandham said God met him in
[2:36:33] an unexpected time.
[2:36:35] That's right.
[2:36:35] Unexpected way an unexpected place
[2:36:38] when he already forgot.
[2:36:41] He said God met him one day where
[2:36:43] in a burning bush
[2:36:44] and then when God season came
[2:36:49] are we together
[2:36:51] along just how
[2:36:52] exactly
[2:36:54] then he revealed his plan to who? Moses
[2:37:00] brother say now the reason that Moses
[2:37:03] has forgot about pre about freedom God
[2:37:06] promised that he would free them but God
[2:37:09] has not forgotten his promise Moses
[2:37:11] tried how
[2:37:13] in himself
[2:37:14] and what happened
[2:37:15] and failed
[2:37:16] that is what the church has done many
[2:37:18] times
[2:37:21] we try ourself
[2:37:23] and we fail
[2:37:24] and then when we fail We blame it on
[2:37:26] God.
[2:37:27] We blame it on the pastor.
[2:37:30] Amen.
[2:37:31] Amen.
[2:37:32] Amen.
[2:37:32] Are we together?
[2:37:33] And then he fail. That is what the
[2:37:35] church has done. How many times?
[2:37:37] Many times
[2:37:38] we have tried in ourself.
[2:37:41] That's right.
[2:37:41] To what?
[2:37:42] To do things.
[2:37:43] When we fail to find God's element of
[2:37:48] what?
[2:37:49] Time.
[2:37:51] Amen.
[2:37:52] Are we together?
[2:37:53] Amen.
[2:37:54] Are we together? Amen.
[2:37:55] Now prepare because you're going to hit
[2:37:56] the tarmac, my friend. Brother Brandham
[2:37:58] say God's got time for what?
[2:38:01] All things.
[2:38:02] He's got time that he has. We plant
[2:38:05] what?
[2:38:05] Corn.
[2:38:06] Continue, my friend.
[2:38:07] We got a time that we plow corn.
[2:38:09] Uhhuh. Then we then what?
[2:38:10] We harvest corn.
[2:38:11] Uhhuh.
[2:38:12] Then the spring rains come.
[2:38:13] The drought through the summer,
[2:38:15] the fall rain and what?
[2:38:16] The snows.
[2:38:17] You just can't say I plant my wheat
[2:38:19] today
[2:38:20] and tomorrow and go out harvest it. No,
[2:38:23] it is against the law of God.
[2:38:25] It is against the program of God. God
[2:38:28] has what?
[2:38:29] Times for season.
[2:38:30] He has season for what?
[2:38:32] His word.
[2:38:33] He has time when in the scripture here
[2:38:36] where he said and the presence of the
[2:38:38] Lord was there to do what?
[2:38:39] To heal the sick.
[2:38:40] That is when Jesus was ministering to
[2:38:43] and the presence of the Lord was there
[2:38:45] to do what?
[2:38:46] Heal the sick. Maybe at other time the
[2:38:49] presence of the Lord was not there to
[2:38:52] heal the sick.
[2:38:54] In other words, the presence is there
[2:38:57] but not to heal the sick.
[2:39:00] The presence is there for the blessing.
[2:39:03] The presence is there to feel the
[2:39:05] spirit.
[2:39:06] And one day the presence will come for
[2:39:08] the healing.
[2:39:11] Amen.
[2:39:13] Amen.
[2:39:14] I hope you understanding. He says, "And
[2:39:17] we found out that God works everything
[2:39:21] how
[2:39:21] seasonally."
[2:39:25] God's work everything how?
[2:39:27] Seasonally.
[2:39:29] And now when Moses what he failed to
[2:39:32] find was the time limit of who?
[2:39:35] Of God.
[2:39:39] Are we together?
[2:39:40] Amen.
[2:39:40] He pushed. He killed somebody
[2:39:44] and then he ran away and then he
[2:39:46] stopped. He said, "You know what? It
[2:39:48] doesn't work."
[2:39:50] Everything mama told me,
[2:39:52] "I try." Matter of fact, they stubborn
[2:39:54] people.
[2:39:55] They try to even deliver me to Pharaoh.
[2:39:58] I'm going away.
[2:40:00] Amen.
[2:40:01] Amen.
[2:40:02] But what Moses didn't understand, the
[2:40:04] promise say 400.
[2:40:07] Yes, sir.
[2:40:09] Are we together? Amen.
[2:40:10] When 400 hit
[2:40:15] was Moses praying,
[2:40:17] what was he was discouraged about the
[2:40:20] promise?
[2:40:20] He was not even thinking about the
[2:40:22] promise.
[2:40:23] He was minding his own business,
[2:40:26] working for his father-in-law.
[2:40:31] In an unexpected time,
[2:40:33] the one who gave the promise
[2:40:36] came down.
[2:40:38] Amen.
[2:40:39] He said, "Moses,
[2:40:41] Moses, I have heard,
[2:40:45] where were you?
[2:40:48] I have heard the cry of my people.
[2:40:51] Now I have come down.
[2:40:57] [Applause]
[2:40:59] Do you follow me?
[2:41:01] Do you follow me?"
[2:41:02] Moses wanted to deliver Israel as a man.
[2:41:06] Amen.
[2:41:10] I'm finishing my friend.
[2:41:12] Moses wanted to deliver Israel as a
[2:41:15] human being.
[2:41:17] But that was not the program of God.
[2:41:20] But when God came down,
[2:41:22] he called Moses.
[2:41:24] He said, "Come here.
[2:41:26] From today,
[2:41:28] from today,
[2:41:30] you are no longer a human being.
[2:41:33] [Applause]
[2:41:40] You going to be God.
[2:41:49] [Applause]
[2:41:52] Glory, glory, glory, glory, glory.
[2:41:57] Are we together?
[2:41:58] Are we together? So when you talking to
[2:42:00] Pharaoh, you say, "Let my people go."
[2:42:04] You talking like me.
[2:42:06] Why? Because the time has come.
[2:42:10] Now God is veil in Moses.
[2:42:18] [Applause]
[2:42:19] You try many thing in your life as human
[2:42:23] because the time was not there.
[2:42:25] But when the time comes,
[2:42:27] remember you won't be a human being
[2:42:29] anymore.
[2:42:30] Because the scripture say ye are gods
[2:42:34] and all of you are children of the most
[2:42:36] high.
[2:42:37] In other words, God anointed Moses for
[2:42:40] the task.
[2:42:41] Yes, Lord.
[2:42:43] Amen.
[2:42:48] Your brother
[2:42:49] Deon, call him.
[2:42:52] Devin is going to be your prophet.
[2:42:57] So, it's a family problem now.
[2:43:01] Brother, so you the God and your brother
[2:43:04] the prophet.
[2:43:07] So, this church is a family.
[2:43:11] Do you see how God does things?
[2:43:14] Do you see how God does things?
[2:43:16] And you need to go tell Israel that
[2:43:19] the people that doubted you.
[2:43:21] But now go tell them,
[2:43:23] "What is your name?" I am. Tell them I
[2:43:26] am.
[2:43:29] Hallelujah.
[2:43:29] Where you going? Go back to Pharaoh.
[2:43:31] Amen.
[2:43:32] Hallelujah.
[2:43:34] Amen.
[2:43:34] Thank you, Lord.
[2:43:35] Amen.
[2:43:36] And you know what? I'm going to even
[2:43:37] harden Pharaoh.
[2:43:40] Amen.
[2:43:41] So when you talk, he will refuse.
[2:43:43] But just know me and you already talk.
[2:43:45] In other words, when the season come,
[2:43:48] the devil is under control.
[2:43:51] God is working with him like a puppet.
[2:43:53] That's right. That's right.
[2:43:55] Because I created Pharaoh to for for my
[2:43:58] name to go up.
[2:43:59] That's right.
[2:44:00] So Moses, you are part of that promise
[2:44:02] that will make my name be known.
[2:44:04] Okay. So you God,
[2:44:06] Amen.
[2:44:08] speak square.
[2:44:11] Why the season come? Where was that
[2:44:14] power all along? Because the season was
[2:44:16] not there. And because the season was
[2:44:19] not there, Moses pushed. He killed
[2:44:20] somebody.
[2:44:22] Let's check God's season.
[2:44:26] Welcome to Charlotte, North Carolina.
[2:44:28] Let's check God's season.
[2:44:30] Let's stop pushing forward.
[2:44:33] Let's start fasting.
[2:44:36] Let's stop that. Amen.
[2:44:38] Let's start bickering. Bickering e.
[2:44:42] We're not here to we
[2:44:46] slow down. What is for me is for me.
[2:44:51] When the time come, God doesn't have a
[2:44:54] plan B.
[2:44:56] He went and said, in other words, when
[2:44:58] the time came,
[2:45:00] God said, where is Moses?
[2:45:02] This boy, where is he at? The time has
[2:45:05] come. Where is he? He's over there at
[2:45:06] the ship.
[2:45:08] Are you sure? Oh, he killed somebody.
[2:45:10] Forget about it.
[2:45:12] Come here. Because I already
[2:45:13] predestinated you raise here. I killed
[2:45:15] somebody. Forget about it.
[2:45:17] Let's go. No, I have failure. Forget
[2:45:19] about it.
[2:45:20] You matter of fact with your your
[2:45:23] criminal background. You going to be
[2:45:24] God.
[2:45:25] [Applause]
[2:45:28] with your failure,
[2:45:30] everything bad that you did.
[2:45:33] God didn't remember remind Moses that
[2:45:37] he made him God without talking about
[2:45:40] his past.
[2:45:42] Under the blood of books and goats
[2:45:46] that blood removed the error of Moses,
[2:45:49] what will the blood of Jesus Christ do
[2:45:51] to you?
[2:45:53] [Applause]
[2:45:55] Let's stand, my friend. Let's stand. I
[2:45:57] will continue. Let's stand my friend.
[2:45:59] Let's stand right here my friend.
[2:46:01] The season and God providence. We have
[2:46:04] stopped here my friend.
[2:46:06] We will pick up again. I try. I'm going
[2:46:08] to I thought I'm going to finish this
[2:46:10] today. I'm going to finish that. We will
[2:46:12] try again next time. Amen.
[2:46:15] God have set season.
[2:46:18] When the season of God come, you don't
[2:46:20] work for it.
[2:46:22] You don't push anything.
[2:46:25] Amen.
[2:46:26] Amen. Amen.
[2:46:28] Remind the devil,
[2:46:29] my life is not in your hand.
[2:46:33] What I'm going through now, it's shaping
[2:46:35] me.

[2:49:14] Heavenly Father,
[2:49:16] Lord, we approaching you humbly this
[2:49:18] afternoon. Father, thanking you for your
[2:49:21] grace, for your love, for your mercy and
[2:49:24] for the word that you have given us.
[2:49:27] Lord, how many scar do we have in our
[2:49:29] life? How many error have we committed
[2:49:32] like Moses?
[2:49:34] How many damage have we done
[2:49:37] because of not understanding your
[2:49:39] program and your element
[2:49:42] and the time appropriate for things to
[2:49:45] happen.
[2:49:45] Thank you Lord.
[2:49:46] And because of that we have
[2:49:49] discouragement.
[2:49:50] We have frustration. We are confused.
[2:49:54] We are confessing but in our heart we
[2:49:57] are doubting whether the word that we
[2:49:59] heard was truth or not. We are hoping
[2:50:04] haphazardly
[2:50:06] saying that maybe one day he will
[2:50:08] remember him.
[2:50:09] But your word is certain.
[2:50:12] Your word is sure.
[2:50:14] Your word is guaranteed. Your word is
[2:50:16] full of assurance
[2:50:18] that we should not even waver it. We
[2:50:21] should take you at your word
[2:50:23] and go home happy knowing that in due
[2:50:26] season in the appropriate time you will
[2:50:29] do that which we ask you.
[2:50:30] Father may this message soak
[2:50:33] deep and grab hold
[2:50:36] to an anchor in the soul
[2:50:38] that will stabilize your children
[2:50:40] in the midst of whatever they're going
[2:50:42] through.
[2:50:43] Father bless them
[2:50:46] and give them peace.
[2:50:47] Amen. and may they remain focused and
[2:50:50] centered
[2:50:51] knowing that God will give us what we
[2:50:54] need
[2:50:55] in due time. Father, I thank you for
[2:50:57] this church and I bless your children
