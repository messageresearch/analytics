was put on the little and the doorpost. The little is the cross timber and on the doorpost. And then the lamb was roasted and was and and was eaten with bitter herbs and they girded themselves. After the blood was shed and they passed under the shed blood, they were girded and ready for the march. &gt;&gt; Amen. And it's a very beautiful type tonight of people who take communion is not to be associated or affiliated with things of the world anymore. &gt;&gt; They must come under the blood first and be cleansed from all sin which is unbelief and then be shoved with the preparation of the gospel. &gt;&gt; Amen. having on the whole armor of God ready for this summons at any time. &gt;&gt; And it was the the sign that the death angel could not go beneath that blood. The death angel had to rise and go over the blood. &gt;&gt; And that's where the poet got the inspiration saying, "When I see the blood, I'll pass over you." It was near the hour of deliverance when they accepted the communion, the the roasted lamb and the the herbs that they taken before leaving. Now, in the antitype that we're to speak of, it was many years ago tonight that Jesus taken what we know as the Lord's supper, the communion. And there's something about it that he was going to talk to his disciples and just before going away, he wanted to talk it over with them. [Music] [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat. Heat.

Amen. So, welcome and fill a home and all new subscriber, God richly bless you and welcome to Spoken Word Tabernacle. I believe we are all up to date with the sermon. We're reading our Bible twice a day, our Cood book, Church Ages. It's amazing how the young children are picking up on the church ages. It's it's so beautiful. Amen. &gt;&gt; This is not a Catholic uh place where the priest has a different book than the congregation. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; You read what I read and then when we come together and the Holy Spirit catches up then it's a different story all together. Amen. &gt;&gt; So we're reading our seals our 70 weeks of Daniel adoption or somebody is listening to the message of the hour. I used to put brother Brandham I usually put brother Brandham and sometime I go to sleep and the tape is playing and finally recently I saw a quote where brother Brandham say he used to read his Bible and then fall asleep. I say okay now I have a quote to back me up. If somebody have a problem they say but Stephen you're sleeping listening to the word. Of course sometime we can be worn out but I rather go to sleep thinking meditating on the word because there is a key to that. If you go to the book of Daniel, you notice that Nebuchadnezzar the king was meditating &gt;&gt; on certain thing before he slept &gt;&gt; and the Holy Spirit use that &gt;&gt; to bring him the vision. &gt;&gt; Go verify and you will see it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Going through my announcement, married couple meeting September the 20th. It's coming sooner. Part seven and then December the 13th part eight because we got to secure the facility. Young Sisters meeting, it's September the 27th. If any more question, go ahead and put it in so we get ready for it. And October the 11th, question and answer. Youngsmen, October the 25th for part three on courtship sheep and for the building. You keep praying. There's still a little bit of work to do up there. Once we finish, we will be clear for the final inspection and we move the Abraham Lincoln uh toward the fellowship hall. Amen. God is doing things that is beyond my understanding. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; it might make sense to you, but to me it doesn't make sense. All I can see is a divine hand of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We've been reminding contractor over and over and they keep waving and sometime they lose the um what do you call it the uh the plan and uh and and the drawing and then they come back they say can you send the drawing again? And we say, "Wait a minute. We already sent the drawing, so we go back. It's a battle." Amen. &gt;&gt; But God is moving in a supernatural way. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, uh, the man that was supposed to do the framing outside and the and the foundation, he does the framing and the u the metal framing and the and the foundation and he goes with the rock. It's one one contractor he doing. He does all of that. He's the one that did the work there. Everything looks smooth and very good. That's the man that did it. So I keep reminding him. I keep reminding him. I keep reminding him and you know your pastor and I learned that from the scripture. You got to keep going to the judge until the door open up. So uh on Tuesday I send him a message to remind him and I told him send him like hey we still need the code for the connector up there. The wall is already erected if we can begin to frame over there while we waiting on the on the building. And he told me he said, "Pastor, I am so busy. I am so busy. I have big project of $150,000 project." And so the Lord is blessing the man &gt;&gt; by working on this building right here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's Can you say amen? &gt;&gt; Uh the Lord begin to bless the man. He said, "Pastor, I have so much work. I don't even have time. Let's do this. Let's do what? He say, "You go buy the material. I'm going to send the man to do the work for you. Just pay them. You don't need to pay me. [Applause] don't understand what he means. &gt;&gt; We are saving thousands of dollars. &gt;&gt; We are saving 8, 10 or $15,000 just by that. He say you go buy the I said where can I get the material? He even gave me the the store. He said go to Charlotte this and this. Get the material. As soon as you get it, give me a call. I send my crew. You pay them. &gt;&gt; You don't pay me and you do the work. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. He said, "Patro, by the way, how about the fellowship hall?" I say, "You know what? I'm just I'm I'm still building up the money. I have $17,000." He said, "Wait a minute. I was waiting for 12,000. Then we can start the work and the remaining we can go later on. &gt;&gt; Church, I hope you're understanding what I'm saying. &gt;&gt; This is a miracle from God. So, I'm not looking at how much money we have in the car. I'm looking at the big God that we serving. &gt;&gt; And it's God doing all of this. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God has been so merciful to us that we saving thousands of dollar. He know where we are, but it's our season to be blessed. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You believe it? &gt;&gt; So, just keep praying. Keep doing what you're doing. By God's grace, one of these day you will see the lenon begin to work over there. Just know we are shooting things over there. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All we need is just to make a list, order it, get the material and the guys come there. So sometime those lingering &gt;&gt; those forgetting of the plan and missing the plan were necessary &gt;&gt; because if he would have give me the plan when I asked for it he would have put his own commission in the plan &gt;&gt; but because of the difficulty that is happen the trial that is happening &gt;&gt; that get us upset sometime it's working together for good it got him so tired and weary until he doesn't want to deal with it anymore. That's why the Bible say all things are working together for good. &gt;&gt; Even if it's a stop, hold on. There is a blessing behind it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, glory to God. Amen. You heard about Sister Yok's wedding. So, just remember the whole church is invited. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, this is so quick. Make sure you make some arrangement because if you don't show up, remember your wedding will come. &gt;&gt; If not your wedding, your anniversary will come, &gt;&gt; your birthday will come. You want everybody to be there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So make sure you show up there. Bring your smile and your happiness and your joy because one by one they getting married.

We leave it the way it is because we don't want people to linger there and sit there and talking and things like that whether there's something going on or not. Just know the nursery is for ch mama with children. Amen. &gt;&gt; Unless you are a notoriized personal or you has a you or you have a visa from the deacon to go there then you can go there. If not just remember we need uh you need to go through the baby shower and everything. then uh we get your blessing then we see you over there.

Brother Robert is smiling. So everything is good. Brother Tony is smiling. So I know we got everything set up. Amen. &gt;&gt; So flat attend and prepare for take off. Let's go straight to the reading of our scripture. I was trying to read one scripture and I sat there. The Holy Spirit brought another other scripture to read. So I don't have any choice. I got to obey the spirit of the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; Uh let's pray. Heavenly Father, Lord, we are approaching you humbly again this morning. Father, thanking you for your grace, your love, your mercy, and for everything you have been doing for us. Father, this is as far as I can go with the ability you have given me. But when it comes to ministering to your children, he only take the supernatural action of the Holy Spirit. Lord, may you come and move me and the congregation completely out of the way. May the windows of heaven be open up. May you pour your blessing again. May you bless us and touch every area, every aspect of our life and speak to our soul. Father, be the alpha and the omega, the beginning and the ending of this service. Bless those that are here and the church online, Lord. Father, the invisible audience in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's go to Genesis 37. My theme this morning, if the Lord allow, it's the wisdom. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The wisdom of Isachar. the wisdom of Issachar in seasons. &gt;&gt; So we are picking up from where we get there is a wisdom that goes with Issachar. But before we get there, let's go to Genesis 37. Very familiar because we are still on the series. If you need the title quick the Bible uh the title is our life journey through Joseph five garment part 77 27 &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God let's go to Genesis 37 very familiar very easy I'm just touching point here then we take off verse one and Jacob dwell in the land wherein his father was a stranger in the land of Canaan. You might be seated. Verse two. These are the generations of Jacob. Joseph being 17 years old was feeding the flock with his brethren. So he had a responsibility. &gt;&gt; And the lad was with the sons of Bill and with the sons of Zilpa, his father's wife. And Joseph brought to his father the evil report. This is where I'm getting now. Israel loved Jacob more than all his children. &gt;&gt; Joseph, &gt;&gt; he loved Jacob more. He loved Joseph more than what? &gt;&gt; All his children. &gt;&gt; Somebody's really awake. &gt;&gt; Now, Israel loved Joseph more than all his children. So, at home, Joseph was favored. I pray God if I can reach where I'm trying to go &gt;&gt; and I pray God we stay synchronized &gt;&gt; with the spirit of the Lord. &gt;&gt; So at home Joseph is favored. &gt;&gt; He found grace. He's loved above everybody. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. because he was the son of his old age and he made him a coat of many colors. So from home we can see the difference &gt;&gt; with the life of Joseph. &gt;&gt; There is something special about this boy that when he came all attention I turned completely toward him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Job 2:4. And when his brethren saw that their father love him more than all his brethren. Normal my friend. Amen. &gt;&gt; You happy? Daddy love me. Daddy love me. Just know there is something else that come with daddy love me. &gt;&gt; The Lord love me. The Lord bless me. The Lord bless me. Just know there is something else. &gt;&gt; Ah not just the Lord love me. &gt;&gt; If you see somebody mad, just understand he goes with the Lord love me. &gt;&gt; That's right. That's right. Amen. &gt;&gt; We're not in heaven. &gt;&gt; No, &gt;&gt; we are not in heaven. We are on earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Somebody will be happy. Somebody will be mad. &gt;&gt; H you got to go with both of them. &gt;&gt; But what you need to do is being unconscious &gt;&gt; of those that are mad. &gt;&gt; Because by being mad at you, they are mad at God. Because what you are is God that gave you. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Uh-huh. And the Bible says, "And uh when his brethren saw that their father loved him more than all his brethren, they hated him. &gt;&gt; This is his brother. &gt;&gt; Not his not a neighbor. the brother. &gt;&gt; I don't know why this is happening to me. I didn't do anything. I was just shaking the hand. &gt;&gt; Grow up. &gt;&gt; Not everybody will stand. What's going on with you? &gt;&gt; Did you fabricate your voice? &gt;&gt; Did you fabricate your voice? Did you sit down and say, "Let me open my cord and then make sure that I'm a good singer." No. So why should we have a problem with your singing? &gt;&gt; It is God who who who created brother Angelo with that voice. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. And if he sing and the anointing comes downless, &gt;&gt; enjoy the anointing. &gt;&gt; He say &gt;&gt; and they hated him and could not speak to him. What? Peacefully. &gt;&gt; Peacefully. God bless. God bless you, sister. Bless you. Leave it alone. &gt;&gt; Maybe they got a problem with your dress. &gt;&gt; I don't know where those are coming up. I'm just warming the airplane. &gt;&gt; What you need to do is go and say, "Sister, &gt;&gt; I love the way you dress. &gt;&gt; Can you help me also dress and get some nice dresses like you? That's it. &gt;&gt; I don't see what is special about it. &gt;&gt; You just got it. [Laughter] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay, that's your problem. Verse six. And he says to them, &gt;&gt; "Here, I pray you the dream." Oh, verse five. And Joseph dreamed a dream and he told it his brethren and they hated him yet the more. &gt;&gt; This dream here were not fabricated by Joseph. &gt;&gt; There I mean uh these dreams were given by God. Amen. &gt;&gt; So we see that not only was he favored and had the grace, but there was a divine presence &gt;&gt; of God &gt;&gt; with this boy. &gt;&gt; And the divine presence was expressed through the gift. &gt;&gt; God was with this man. &gt;&gt; We clear? &gt;&gt; We clear? &gt;&gt; Okay. Let's go to Genesis 39. It's a short reading. It's not like uh the slugger. Genesis 39. If you dare, you can say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And Joseph was brought down to Egypt. And Piper, an officer of Pharaoh, we're in Joseph series anyway, captain of the guard, an Egyptian, brought him of the hands of the Ishelat, which had brought him down there. So he moved from home to Egypt &gt;&gt; and precisely in the house of an Egyptian. So he's no longer a home. &gt;&gt; The setting have changed. He's outside of his comfort zone. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Of his comfort zone. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Over here, we can testify God is there. &gt;&gt; Now, he's right here and the state that he's on. He's a slave &gt;&gt; over here. He was a free man. That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A child that was loved by his father &gt;&gt; over here. He's a slave. &gt;&gt; You would thought because he's switching God left him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Verse two. And the Lord was with Joseph. &gt;&gt; We clear now? So even in Egypt, &gt;&gt; God was there. &gt;&gt; I hope we are talking to somebody. &gt;&gt; We find again a divine presence here. &gt;&gt; Even in Egypt, &gt;&gt; even in Egypt. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Beautiful. &gt;&gt; If he was us, we would have focused on the fact that I'm a slave. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Correct. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; We will dwell every day &gt;&gt; in the fact that my brother sold me. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; They to lie on me. &gt;&gt; They betray me. &gt;&gt; Everybody you meet at Walmart, my father, my brother betray me. My brother sold me. And that's the reason why I am here. &gt;&gt; If you fail in school, my brother hated me. My brother sold me. That's the reason why I am here. If you didn't sleep at night, my the whole story. &gt;&gt; Oh, I'm a slave. I'm a sl everywhere. I'm a slave. &gt;&gt; Why are you a slave? My brother back in the day. &gt;&gt; Why? Back in 1952, &gt;&gt; my uncle molestated me. Let the anchor go. &gt;&gt; Free yourself. &gt;&gt; Sister Adessa, please refocus. Amen. &gt;&gt; We found that the Lord was with Joseph &gt;&gt; and he was a &gt;&gt; poor man. &gt;&gt; No, &gt;&gt; he was what? prospers &gt;&gt; in Canaan. &gt;&gt; In Egypt, &gt;&gt; where in Egypt &gt;&gt; as a free man? &gt;&gt; As a slave. &gt;&gt; He was prosperous as a what? &gt;&gt; As a slave. &gt;&gt; In his own house. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; In somebody else house, &gt;&gt; but he's prosperous. &gt;&gt; I hope we getting the message &gt;&gt; because according to us, you need to be home. We desire to be home &gt;&gt; close to our father &gt;&gt; to be prosper. &gt;&gt; We found him slave. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Not his home. &gt;&gt; But what happened? He was a prosperous man. &gt;&gt; As a slave, &gt;&gt; not a home in the house of a master. Right. &gt;&gt; As a worker, &gt;&gt; not a free worker, a slave. &gt;&gt; Yet God presence is there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So God presence doesn't depend on the geographical. &gt;&gt; Ah, no problem, my friend. Let's keep moving. And he was in the house of his master. What? &gt;&gt; The Egyptian. &gt;&gt; Not his own house. &gt;&gt; Verse three. And his master. So &gt;&gt; this boy was so special. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; That even the master. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; So it doesn't matter where you put Joseph. &gt;&gt; It doesn't matter where you put Joseph. The problem is not the location. The problem is himself. &gt;&gt; It's Joseph. &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit is following Joseph. [Music] &gt;&gt; Even if you go through the valley of the shadow of death, the Holy Spirit is following Joseph. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The problem is not the location. The problem is you. [Music] &gt;&gt; The problem is not the wilderness. The problem is who's crossing the wilderness. If it's Israel, you don't worry about the wilderness &gt;&gt; because the rock will produce water. &gt;&gt; In the wilderness, &gt;&gt; Father, help us. &gt;&gt; Let's go to verse uh uh three. And his master saw that the Lord was with him and the Lord and that the Lord made what? &gt;&gt; All he did &gt;&gt; that he did to do what? prosper in his hand &gt;&gt; in in in Canaan or in Egypt? &gt;&gt; In Egypt &gt;&gt; instead of focusing on the slavery &gt;&gt; and the hatred. &gt;&gt; As a matter of fact, the hatred &gt;&gt; was necessary to change the season. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let me continue &gt;&gt; verse four. And Joseph found grace where? &gt;&gt; In his sight. &gt;&gt; And serve him. And he made him overseer over his house. And all that he have he put where? &gt;&gt; In his hands. &gt;&gt; We clear so far? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We clear so far. &gt;&gt; Now drop to verse uh 20. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; We going very quick. Praise God. &gt;&gt; And Joseph master took him. Are we together? Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And put him where? &gt;&gt; Into a prison. &gt;&gt; So, Joseph now is no longer in a house. Where is he at? &gt;&gt; Prison. &gt;&gt; From the Egyptian house. Now, Joseph is where? &gt;&gt; Prison. &gt;&gt; It looks like Joseph is dropping below. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; From home &gt;&gt; to a slavery. from slavery. Instead of going right up, he goes down again. &gt;&gt; But let's see where God is &gt;&gt; because God is in the elevator with Joseph. &gt;&gt; As Joseph is coming down the elevator, God is also in the elevator. &gt;&gt; Verse 20. &gt;&gt; And Joseph master did what? took him and put him into the prison. A place where the king's prisoner were bound. And he was there where? &gt;&gt; In the prison. &gt;&gt; Is it the appropriate place? &gt;&gt; Is it a nice place? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; As a matter of fact, pify place was even better. &gt;&gt; Now I'm in the prison &gt;&gt; for something I didn't do. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And the same situation again happened. &gt;&gt; Somebody told lie on me. &gt;&gt; Yes. using my mentor. &gt;&gt; My brother took my mentor &gt;&gt; and put blood and told lie to my father. &gt;&gt; Now a woman took my mentor &gt;&gt; and went and took and put lie. What curse is going on in my life? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Was it a curse? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; So remove from your mind that you under a curse. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. because something happened to you. [Laughter] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let's go to verse uh uh uh 21. But but it's a it goes as a contradiction. &gt;&gt; But what &gt;&gt; the Lord was with Joseph. &gt;&gt; The Lord was with Joseph where? &gt;&gt; In prison. So in prison &gt;&gt; again we find a divine presence. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So God is not only where you think he is. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When everything is going good, nobody get sick, all is well, then God is with me. &gt;&gt; Amen. The Bible say, "But the Lord was with Joseph and showed him mercy." &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; "And gave him what?" &gt;&gt; Favor &gt;&gt; in the sight of what? &gt;&gt; The keeper of the prison. &gt;&gt; How can a prisoner &gt;&gt; prosper? &gt;&gt; I feel like I'm in a prison. &gt;&gt; Your prison is a different prison. Watch what you do in prison. &gt;&gt; Don't focus on the prison. &gt;&gt; Don't focus on the building of the prison. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Uh uh let's go. And the keeper of the prison committed to Joseph handwater. &gt;&gt; All the prisoners. &gt;&gt; How can they commit to a prisoner at the prisoner? &gt;&gt; You you have a jailbreak. &gt;&gt; Correct. [Laughter] Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He says that and the keeper of the prison did what? &gt;&gt; Committed to the Joseph's &gt;&gt; to Joseph's hand all the prisoners that were in the prison. And whatsoever they did there, he was the what? &gt;&gt; The doer of &gt;&gt; So now who was in charge of the prison? &gt;&gt; Joseph. So, was the prison really a prison or another promotion to a manager position? &gt;&gt; It depends on how you reading it. &gt;&gt; If it was me and you, I'm in prison right here. I'm in prison right here. I'm in this place right here. Wake up. &gt;&gt; Forget about the prison. &gt;&gt; The footstep of the righteous. [Applause] In other word, God doesn't take you to a place just like that. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; Job 2 verse uh 23. The keeper of the prison look not to anything. What a confidence. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A man that was bought to try to try to rape somebody else's wife. [Laughter] &gt;&gt; Glory. Glory. That's what the Bible says. &gt;&gt; Why is he in prison? He was trying to rape his master. &gt;&gt; And they took and they give that man uh I mean I mean a manager in prison. &gt;&gt; And they don't even control him. &gt;&gt; Never fight when you know you are innocent. &gt;&gt; Stay calm. &gt;&gt; When you know you are innocent, &gt;&gt; just stay calm. When you know you didn't do anything wrong, &gt;&gt; hush. &gt;&gt; Live your life. [Music] &gt;&gt; It's just a matter of time. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said the keeper of the prison looked not to anything that was under his hand because of what? &gt;&gt; The Lord was with him. &gt;&gt; So the keeper of the prison testify of the presence of God, the divine presence of God with this boy. Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He says, "And that which he did, the Lord made it how?" &gt;&gt; To prosper. &gt;&gt; So he prospered where? &gt;&gt; Everywhere. &gt;&gt; Everywhere. &gt;&gt; In prison. How can you prosper in prison? &gt;&gt; Favor. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is my Bible different than yours? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Favor in prison. &gt;&gt; And not only pray favor, but he prosper. How can you be in prison and prospering? Right. &gt;&gt; It's a paradox. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; The lesson I'm trying to draw right here &gt;&gt; is no matter where Joseph is, &gt;&gt; God is there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; So, you have a choice to focus on the presence of God &gt;&gt; or on the state or condition you find yourself in. It's a matter of choice. &gt;&gt; It's a matter of choice between condition, &gt;&gt; between circumstances. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Between the trial, &gt;&gt; between the state &gt;&gt; or between the divine presence of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you focus and the devil want you to focus &gt;&gt; on the fact that you in prison &gt;&gt; the devil want you whenever you speak &gt;&gt; mention to people &gt;&gt; that remember me in prayer you know I'm in prison &gt;&gt; Jesus there it is &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; remember me in prayer you know I'm a I'm a slave in Joseph home right so keep me in prayer. I know one day the Lord will do something for you. &gt;&gt; So all your friend will be calling you just to comfort you every day. &gt;&gt; How are you doing? Keep a good morale. Everything will be okay. One of this day you will come up there. &gt;&gt; That's what the devil want you to do. &gt;&gt; In other words, keep busy on the negative side. Are we together? And when you focus on the negative side, you will miss the positive side that is in that negative place. &gt;&gt; I don't know if we together. &gt;&gt; I don't know if we are together. &gt;&gt; You can look either either you stay on the negative side &gt;&gt; or you look at the positive side. Yes. &gt;&gt; When you begin to look at the positive side, &gt;&gt; then you are in prison, but you don't have shackles. &gt;&gt; Shake somebody's hand, my friend. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; It's a prison, &gt;&gt; but you are free. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's a prison, but you are walking. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's a prison, but you are working like a manager. &gt;&gt; But you are in prison. &gt;&gt; Focus on that. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you, brother Charles Senior. God bless you, brother Steven. Where are you at? In prison. &gt;&gt; Okay. In prison. Do you have shackles? No. Did they lock you up? No. &gt;&gt; Do they give you food at a certain time? No. &gt;&gt; So, what are you doing in prison? No. I'm a free I'm a manager right here. I'm taking care of uh the inventory and I'm giving food. [Applause] &gt;&gt; If you look in between the line, it is not a prison. It is a preparation step &gt;&gt; that God has put you &gt;&gt; to get you somewhere. &gt;&gt; The devil want you to look at prison. &gt;&gt; The devil want you to look at a master's house, a slave. &gt;&gt; God want you to focus on I put you here for a training. &gt;&gt; There is a bigger job ahead. Yes sir. That's exactly right. That's exactly right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let me ask you a question. &gt;&gt; If Joseph have traveled himself to Egypt, now this is off my note. &gt;&gt; And he's a free man in Egypt &gt;&gt; and he get a job. &gt;&gt; Joseph can do what he want. &gt;&gt; He can even quit the job. He can even leave the job and go hang out on downtown and at at uh at at 11:00 p.m. &gt;&gt; But because he's a slave, &gt;&gt; God put those restraint. &gt;&gt; It is God that put the restraint. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; You think it's a restraint. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. God want you to stay focused. &gt;&gt; God knows if he give you too much liberty, &gt;&gt; you will miss your preparation. &gt;&gt; You miss it. Young people, do you get me? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; It is not a blockage on liberty. Watch what God is doing. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; When Joseph begin to prosper &gt;&gt; in the house of Pifer &gt;&gt; and Porifer say, "You know what? My bank account is right here." &gt;&gt; In the morning, Joseph is on the in the Cadillac going to Bank of America. He get there. Joseph. Everybody in Bank of America knows him. Everybody in W Fargo knows him. God say too much liberty. &gt;&gt; Now he begin to get popular in the city. Let me decrease the liberty. Remove him from there. Put him in prison so he won't go again at Bank of America. [Applause] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. Oh God, why did you bring me down here? No, here in prison, you don't go out too much. &gt;&gt; You going to focus on the manager &gt;&gt; because on the future, you going to be the manager of the entire world. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Before I put that big responsibility in your hand, &gt;&gt; I must make sure you are well prepared. You must learn discipline as a slave. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; It was a season of preparation. &gt;&gt; And all and the shifting of this season from one season to another. It always takes trial. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. To move from one season to another, it's a trial. &gt;&gt; To move from another season to the prison, it's a trial. &gt;&gt; And to move from the prison to the presence of Pharaoh, there was another trial. &gt;&gt; He put his confidence in the man &gt;&gt; and the man forgot about him for two years. &gt;&gt; He went through another trial. &gt;&gt; So it's trial that is making you shift. Amen. &gt;&gt; You didn't get that, my friend. So, when a trial is coming in your life, get ready to shift. is coming. The eagle get in the storm and the storm take the eagle up. &gt;&gt; The eagle doesn't run away from storm. &gt;&gt; You face the storm because the storm usually carry you to a next step. [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Two things my friend. condition, circumstances, trial, state versus the divine presence of God. &gt;&gt; The devil want you to focus right here. &gt;&gt; The devil doesn't want you to focus here &gt;&gt; because if you focus here, you're going to miss the time. &gt;&gt; Every time you going through a season, there is a time. &gt;&gt; There is a time associated. &gt;&gt; Maybe this is two years. This is three years. In two years, if you focus on the negative, you miss everything the Holy Spirit was putting there. &gt;&gt; And when you go to the fourth grade, you're going to flunk it &gt;&gt; because you failed to overcome that season. &gt;&gt; There is &gt;&gt; and to carry what you overcome to move to the next step. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Now, let's go to our reading today. That was what was given to me this morning. Now, let's go to our reading in 2 Chronicle 12. That's the only reading. Amen. &gt;&gt; Wonderful. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Whoever is sleeping, shake yourself. &gt;&gt; Wake them up. Wake them up. &gt;&gt; I was reading a quote. Brother Brandham say, "If a doctor tells you what to do, &gt;&gt; and you don't do what the doctor tells you, &gt;&gt; it is your own responsibility." &gt;&gt; So now, the Holy Spirit is trying to help you on what to do. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the devil is trying to make you sleepy. &gt;&gt; And tomorrow, when did you preach about that? &gt;&gt; Now I have to go back online and search the sermon for you. &gt;&gt; You do it yourself. &gt;&gt; Uh 1 Chronicles 12 &gt;&gt; verse 32. If you dare, you can say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. chapter 1 Chronicle chapter 2 chapter 12 verse 32 sorry thank you &gt;&gt; 1 Chronicle 12:32 then we soar but you will need your Bible &gt;&gt; because we're going to get into something amen &gt;&gt; and the children of what &gt;&gt; issakar &gt;&gt; Issachar which were men that had water &gt;&gt; understanding &gt;&gt; there is two things about the wisdom of Issachar car is a car has understanding. The word understanding, the true word is discernment. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They had discernment of what? &gt;&gt; The times. &gt;&gt; That word times goes with season. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Go ahead, my friend. The discernment of uh time. come an understanding of time to know what what &gt;&gt; Israel ought to do. &gt;&gt; The second thing on Issachar, they know &gt;&gt; what to do. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Ought to do. In other words, they don't just discern the season. &gt;&gt; Now, hey, I'm in party for house. &gt;&gt; That's good. &gt;&gt; But what should I do? &gt;&gt; There it is. Amen. &gt;&gt; What should I do in house? &gt;&gt; That's the problem. So, is tells you it indicate this is the time &gt;&gt; and based on this, this is the way you need to behave right now &gt;&gt; based on the season &gt;&gt; because the season bring its own blessing. &gt;&gt; So, you need to know what to do &gt;&gt; according to the season. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you don't know what the season is, &gt;&gt; you already lost. &gt;&gt; But if you know, but what should I do &gt;&gt; based on this? If the alarm sound, what should I do? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If I found out it's a cancer, what should I do? &gt;&gt; If it's a tuberculosis, what should I do? &gt;&gt; Diagnosis is fine. &gt;&gt; It's one step, but the next step is what do you do now? Amen. &gt;&gt; A doctor must first diagnose &gt;&gt; and then know the treatment to administer based on the diagnosis. &gt;&gt; So the wisdom of Issachar tells you the time and he also tell you what to do. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; The Bible say to know what Israel ought to do. The heads of them were what? 200 &gt;&gt; men and all their brethren were at their water &gt;&gt; commandment &gt;&gt; so far. Let's stop right there. &gt;&gt; The wisdom of Issachar that we talking about here in season is a wisdom that first discern the season. &gt;&gt; And after discernment, he goes ahead and give you instruction. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He gives instruction. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; On what to do. Because if you don't know what to do, you are lost. &gt;&gt; You are filled only with knowledge. &gt;&gt; That's correct. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You are stuck in faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But you don't have works. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; And then faith without work is dead. &gt;&gt; You need to have faith. &gt;&gt; And you need to have works. &gt;&gt; You need to know what it is. And what are you supposed to do? Are we together? &gt;&gt; Brother Brham says this. Glory to God. In the message God's provided approach to divine fellowship. Brother Brham said there is so much of it today. There is so many of us. If someone say what can I do to be saved, &gt;&gt; what do we tell them? &gt;&gt; Quit your lying &gt;&gt; and then what? &gt;&gt; Quit your stealing &gt;&gt; and what? &gt;&gt; Quit your smoking &gt;&gt; and what? &gt;&gt; Quit your drinking. &gt;&gt; I believe they should do that too. But that does not answer his question. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; The question is what must I do? &gt;&gt; You begin to tell. &gt;&gt; Let me read brother Brandham. Brother Brandham said but that does not answer what &gt;&gt; his question. &gt;&gt; You are telling him what not to do. &gt;&gt; He wants to know what to do. &gt;&gt; Are we together? You are telling me quit lying. Okay, quit lying. So what is next? Quit smoking. &gt;&gt; And then what is next? Before you know it, I have a long list of quit, quit, quit, quit, quit, quit, quit. The problem is what should I do? &gt;&gt; I need to know what to do. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Brother said, Paul said to the Philippian jailer, he never told him, put up your sword &gt;&gt; and do all this and the other. He said what? &gt;&gt; Believe on the Lord Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; and thou shalt be saved. Thou and thy house believe and do what? &gt;&gt; Have faith. &gt;&gt; Paul never say quit lying, put your soul, do this. No, he went straight to the point and give the necessary instruction. &gt;&gt; The appropriate instruction &gt;&gt; to get the job done. &gt;&gt; Are we together? We know that according to Ecclesiastes 3:1 to everything &gt;&gt; there is a season. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When he says everything, it's everything. &gt;&gt; It is even beyond what you have in your mind. &gt;&gt; That's true. &gt;&gt; Everything have a season. &gt;&gt; Everything. &gt;&gt; And by knowing that everything have a season, it brings hope. &gt;&gt; That's right. I don't know if you get it. &gt;&gt; When I know that everything have a season, &gt;&gt; it brings hope &gt;&gt; because I know that if I'm going through a bad time, &gt;&gt; whatever I'm going through has a season. &gt;&gt; In other words, whatever I'm going through must stop somewhere. &gt;&gt; It's not going to stay eternal. After a while, I'm going to come out of it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Brother Brham says this in the message, "The hour is come." &gt;&gt; He says, "It came time, one time for the children of Israel to be what? &gt;&gt; Delivered from &gt;&gt; delivered from the Egyptian bondage. And when the time of the promise drew nigh, they raised up a pharaoh who did not know Joseph. Why? &gt;&gt; The season was there. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; They respected Israel until that time. &gt;&gt; But the season was there for no more respect. &gt;&gt; So there was a season to be respected. &gt;&gt; And there is a season not to be respected. If you going through a time where people are talking about you, just remember there is a season. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Put your seat belts, my friend. I'm going to take off from the airport. &gt;&gt; There is a season people will respect you. &gt;&gt; And there is another season people will not respect you. No matter what you do, &gt;&gt; no matter how much you beg them, &gt;&gt; how much you babysit them, &gt;&gt; whatever you do, it's not working. Amen. &gt;&gt; Do not get frustrated at them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Remember, it's a season. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Why is it a season? It brings me hope &gt;&gt; that sooner I'm going to get out of this. &gt;&gt; The Bible says this. Brother Brandham continue. He says that God could shower down his judgment upon the people. The time had come. In Hebrew 12:2, the Bible say looking unto who? &gt;&gt; Jesus. In other words, focus on Jesus. &gt;&gt; Turn. In other words, turn from everything else. &gt;&gt; Paul say look unto Jesus. &gt;&gt; What do you want us to look in Jesus? &gt;&gt; Paul is explaining. Paul is saying that looking unto Jesus who is what? &gt;&gt; The author. &gt;&gt; He's the alpha and the what? &gt;&gt; Finisher &gt;&gt; of what? &gt;&gt; Of faith. &gt;&gt; So who start your faith? &gt;&gt; Jesus. &gt;&gt; So who's supposed to bring you to perfection? &gt;&gt; Jesus. So what do you have to do for yourself? &gt;&gt; So who start your journey? &gt;&gt; Jesus. &gt;&gt; Who finished your journey? &gt;&gt; Jesus. &gt;&gt; So what do you have to worry about it? &gt;&gt; You don't. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; And the Bible say Jesus who is the author and the finisher of our faith who for the joy &gt;&gt; that was set where &gt;&gt; before &gt;&gt; he did what? &gt;&gt; Endured the cross. So Jesus before he endured the cross. &gt;&gt; He saw something. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I'm reading the Bible. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because you say, "Oh, Jesus went through the cross and then he was and they beat him. He didn't say nothing and then they spit on him and Jesus was quiet." Jesus was doing that for a reason. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. Jesus saw another season. [Laughter] &gt;&gt; The Bible say for the joy that was what? &gt;&gt; Set before him. &gt;&gt; He did what? &gt;&gt; Endure the cross. &gt;&gt; So the strength to endure the cross &gt;&gt; came from the vision that he saw ahead. [Applause] In other words, because of what I'm going to get there, because of the degree I will get there, &gt;&gt; I'm not worrying about how much I don't sleep at night. &gt;&gt; I might be staying all night studying. &gt;&gt; But that's not a problem because I'm looking at the degree. &gt;&gt; I'm looking at the diploma. [Applause] &gt;&gt; I don't know if we together. Amen. &gt;&gt; You think Jesus just went like that? &gt;&gt; Remember the pillar of fire left him. &gt;&gt; That's right, brother. That's right, brother. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; So Jesus went to the cross without the pillar of fire. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; My friend, is my Bible different? &gt;&gt; God left Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; You ready? &gt;&gt; Are you ready? Yeah. &gt;&gt; Jesus went to the cross without the Holy Ghost. [Music] &gt;&gt; I'm waiting. The pillar of fire left him. That's why he said, "My father, my father, the father left him. He overcome the devil without the Holy Ghost." &gt;&gt; Amen. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; He didn't have the fullness of the Godhead badly. &gt;&gt; But what kept him going, &gt;&gt; it was what he saw ahead. &gt;&gt; The vision he saw ahead gave him strength. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I don't know if we together. In other words, Lord, because of what I'm going to get, &gt;&gt; I don't care what's going on. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's very easy. You say Jesus was God. &gt;&gt; He got the fullness of the Godhead badly. &gt;&gt; So, it's easy for Jesus to endure the cross. As a matter of fact, they even help him bear the cross &gt;&gt; by sermon of &gt;&gt; he was even unable to bear his own cross. &gt;&gt; So it's normal for you to go sometime and you feel overwhelmed. It's normal. [Applause] &gt;&gt; The problem is the season give me hope. I know this cross have an end. &gt;&gt; I know the devil will go only that far. &gt;&gt; When it's finished, God comes in &gt;&gt; because David say he will not let his holy one &gt;&gt; see corruption. When Jesus heard that, he said no problem. Satan, take me where you want it. &gt;&gt; Take me where you want. I know this is just for a season. But after season in the resurrection morning, he came out. He said, "All power in heaven and earth are given unto me." &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; What gives him strength? The result. &gt;&gt; There was another season. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus was going down through the prison. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Through hell and from hell. He was climbing higher than even the heaven itself. &gt;&gt; And the Bible say for the joy &gt;&gt; that was set before him. &gt;&gt; When he look at you &gt;&gt; when he look at spoken word &gt;&gt; and he saw you saying amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus say Satan bring it on &gt;&gt; because I see a church in Gastonia on fire under the message of Yahweh. people that will worship me in the beauty of holiness. Hallelujah. When I see them, I don't care. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Season bring you hope. &gt;&gt; Season bring you strength. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; The Bible say, "For the joy that was set where?" &gt;&gt; He did what? &gt;&gt; Endured the cross. &gt;&gt; Despising what? the shame. &gt;&gt; So no matter what shame, they even took his clothes off &gt;&gt; and put him over there naked. &gt;&gt; Jesus despised that. &gt;&gt; Why? Because he's focusing on something. &gt;&gt; He's focusing on the book of redemption. &gt;&gt; He said once I cross this, &gt;&gt; I will take the book of redemption and send it back to Adam. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because he knew John will cry. My heart is &gt;&gt; who is worthy. &gt;&gt; He say I don't want when brother John cry and there is no redeemer. I must be there for him. &gt;&gt; When he said who is worthy I am worthy. I am the lion of the tribe of Judah. I have prevailed. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; No matter what you going through &gt;&gt; the season give you hope. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's telling you not. It's not going to be eternal. &gt;&gt; It is temporal. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; For the joy that was set before him, he did what? &gt;&gt; Endured the cross. &gt;&gt; And did what? &gt;&gt; Despising the shame. &gt;&gt; And he set after the season &gt;&gt; down where? &gt;&gt; At the right hand of the throne of God. &gt;&gt; Now after that &gt;&gt; today, every knee bow, &gt;&gt; every throne, &gt;&gt; every knee, every tongue shall do what? When Jesus look at that &gt;&gt; above principalities and stuff, &gt;&gt; he endured the cross. &gt;&gt; When they struck him, he's quiet saying, "Don't worry, Satan. Keep moving. &gt;&gt; Keep moving. Keep moving. Sooner, I'm going to see Abraham and everybody." &gt;&gt; The season of trial brought him to paradise. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? Season brings hope. Knowing that whatever you going through is only temporal. &gt;&gt; There is something better that is coming up. &gt;&gt; If I'm going through a valley, there must be a mountain. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Brother Brham says this. He says that father Jesus speaking. He says, "Father, the what? &gt;&gt; The time has come. &gt;&gt; Now there is a season for what? &gt;&gt; Everything." &gt;&gt; Do you believe that? Yes, &gt;&gt; you saw how &gt;&gt; a certain seed &gt;&gt; and you reap how &gt;&gt; in a certain &gt;&gt; and even the sowing itself according to Psalm 126 the Bible say that they that saw how &gt;&gt; in tears &gt;&gt; you will reap how &gt;&gt; in joy. &gt;&gt; So what is keeping the sew work moving &gt;&gt; it is the joy that is coming up there &gt;&gt; and the Bible say the joy of the Lord is your strength. So when I'm calling, it's not a problem. It is what is coming up after the call. [Applause] Glory, glory, glory, glory, glory, &gt;&gt; go at night and go see sister Pam when she's working &gt;&gt; on the decoration. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; She's right there. &gt;&gt; She even fell. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If I'm not mistaken. &gt;&gt; Go ahead. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. But in the morning on Saturday &gt;&gt; when we came when we entered that place when we begin to look at the decoration &gt;&gt; for the joy of the decoration &gt;&gt; she said pam do you know what the manager of the hotel told me he said whatever she did there were people that stood there and that requested her number. Amen. [Applause] &gt;&gt; All the toys and everything, there was something ahead. Amen. &gt;&gt; He was beyond brother Kenny. &gt;&gt; He was opening a door for something else. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? The who who goes in sowing how? &gt;&gt; In tears &gt;&gt; shall reap how &gt;&gt; in joy. &gt;&gt; He that goes forth in what? &gt;&gt; Weeping &gt;&gt; bearing water &gt;&gt; precious seed. &gt;&gt; So you bear precious uh um I mean seed laughing &gt;&gt; doing what? &gt;&gt; Weeping shall deathless. In other words, this is a guarantee. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In other words, there is a season to cry. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; There is a season to weep. But if I'm weeping right now, &gt;&gt; Satan, let me give you an announcement. &gt;&gt; There is a season of joy. &gt;&gt; That is coming ahead. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Because joy comes in the morning. &gt;&gt; Weeping may stay in the night, wait in the morning. &gt;&gt; When the sun is up, joy is coming. &gt;&gt; The Bible say deathless he come again. How &gt;&gt; with rejoicing &gt;&gt; bringing water &gt;&gt; she with him &gt;&gt; season &gt;&gt; brings you hope &gt;&gt; I'm coughing &gt;&gt; Satan &gt;&gt; only maybe two weeks you have &gt;&gt; yeah only two weeks &gt;&gt; I'm not going to die &gt;&gt; because the root the devil doesn't get in the root &gt;&gt; that's why when God was opening the door for Job's trial. &gt;&gt; He told the devil, don't touch his life &gt;&gt; because the life goes in the root. &gt;&gt; You don't touch the root. &gt;&gt; In other words, go ahead. It's only two weeks. &gt;&gt; Sometime you take the baby to the hospital and the doctor say keep giving him Tylenol and juice. &gt;&gt; So Satan all you need to leave this baby is juice, &gt;&gt; orange juice. [Applause] [Laughter] Because the virus has its course. &gt;&gt; When it's finished, they all die. &gt;&gt; Season bring you hope. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? Brother Brandham says this. He say, "Our heavenly father, we come to thee on the Sabbath day raining where &gt;&gt; on the outside &gt;&gt; we might call it what? &gt;&gt; Gloom. A gloomy, a hazy, rainy weather. &gt;&gt; But how could the farmer put in his crop? &gt;&gt; What you call a bad weather? &gt;&gt; The farmer is on jubilee. &gt;&gt; Rejoicing. Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; How could the farmer put his crop if we didn't have much moisture this spring? &gt;&gt; So what you call gloomy, &gt;&gt; it's a blessing. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham say there be no food waste ground will be how &gt;&gt; dry &gt;&gt; people will be waterish. &gt;&gt; We realize that this is like experience of water. &gt;&gt; A Christian. &gt;&gt; Sometime we have to go through terrible chastisement. &gt;&gt; Chastisement of who? &gt;&gt; The Lord. &gt;&gt; Many times to do what? &gt;&gt; Correct us. &gt;&gt; That we shall be what? &gt;&gt; Fruit bearing Christians. Because we are trees &gt;&gt; and the tree need to be pruned. &gt;&gt; But the purpose of prrooming is not to kill the tree. &gt;&gt; Is to bring more fruit. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He say sometime has to do what? &gt;&gt; Prune and doing what? &gt;&gt; Cut off. &gt;&gt; And do what? &gt;&gt; Take away &gt;&gt; and take out take out of what? &gt;&gt; Our hands. We think sometime oh God what are you doing to us but he knows what he's doing. &gt;&gt; Amen. So we pray father that today you shall do what &gt;&gt; fruit every one of us &gt;&gt; from the midst to who? &gt;&gt; The greatest &gt;&gt; come out the who? &gt;&gt; The pastor. &gt;&gt; Let me skip that one. &gt;&gt; I read only brother Brham. Ah because you're going to put yourself like the greatest. Brother Brham say that from the list to who? &gt;&gt; The greatest &gt;&gt; the greatest who? He says, "God, we pray that you shall do what? &gt;&gt; Fruit every one of us. &gt;&gt; Take away all that is unlike you, Father. Take away the things that is doing what? &gt;&gt; Hindering us &gt;&gt; from being what?" &gt;&gt; Fruit bearing Christians. &gt;&gt; So your chastisement is a blessing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; With your own brother, you say, "Brother Brham, I'm a Christian. I got a sickness now. I wonder why he come. &gt;&gt; God may be purging you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Give you what? &gt;&gt; Some trials. &gt;&gt; Make you jo &gt;&gt; a little closer to him. Pray a while. Then do what? &gt;&gt; Heal you. &gt;&gt; That you can have what? &gt;&gt; A testimony. &gt;&gt; Christ heal you. You say, "Well, I heard he heal." I The husband is the partaker of the fruit. Then see, I thought he was awful hard when I was getting mine. And if he had just been me, I would have what? &gt;&gt; Failed. &gt;&gt; Brother Brham say if he was just depending on him with your own brother. Brother Brandham himself would have failed the test. &gt;&gt; But brother Brandham said, but something is where &gt;&gt; in me. &gt;&gt; Not me keeping it. &gt;&gt; It's what? &gt;&gt; The question is whether it shall hold out or not. It is whether he held out or not. &gt;&gt; Whether I shall hold out or not. It's whether he God held out or not. And if he held out then I'm sure to be where &gt;&gt; the question is not whether I can do it or not. &gt;&gt; It's whether he did it &gt;&gt; or not. &gt;&gt; I believe he did it and that &gt;&gt; settles it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Brandham continue. He said Job was taking his children through every the only provided approach there was the burnt offering. And now here is a little thing I want you to notice. After all the turmoil &gt;&gt; and everything was over. And then God has taken all his sheep and his cattle and his horses and things. Then at the end of his chastisement &gt;&gt; all what? &gt;&gt; Purging. &gt;&gt; God did what? &gt;&gt; Double it. &gt;&gt; If he had 10,000 cattle, he gave him what? &gt;&gt; 20,000 cattle. &gt;&gt; See? Oh, isn't that wonderful? &gt;&gt; God purge job [Applause] &gt;&gt; not punish &gt;&gt; purge job &gt;&gt; for the purpose to do what? &gt;&gt; Bless him. &gt;&gt; So if I'm going through the purging, &gt;&gt; what is coming up? [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Brother Brham said in the end then after Job had done everything laid in the way. This provided ways of approaches to God for all his children. He approached for his children praying on their behalf. If you ever notice at the end of the road, Job did what? &gt;&gt; Restored back double. &gt;&gt; God gave him double &gt;&gt; what he had. He did what? &gt;&gt; Purged him. &gt;&gt; And did what? &gt;&gt; Restore to him. So the purging have a purpose. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The se there is a season for purging. &gt;&gt; And there is a season for blessing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If I'm going through purging, &gt;&gt; praise the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There is a blessing coming up. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; So what do you do, my friend? What do you do now? Closely do as David did. What do you do? &gt;&gt; Put your future in his hands. What do you have to do? &gt;&gt; What do you have to do? &gt;&gt; Hands. &gt;&gt; Put your future where? &gt;&gt; Hands. &gt;&gt; How am I How what am I to know what to do? Brother, put your future where? &gt;&gt; In his hands. &gt;&gt; No matter what comes. &gt;&gt; All goes. What do you do? &gt;&gt; Trust him. &gt;&gt; He is what? &gt;&gt; The word. &gt;&gt; Now know David say his time is in my hand. &gt;&gt; Trust in him. How many times? &gt;&gt; All the time. Always do what? &gt;&gt; Trust in him. &gt;&gt; He knew what he held the future. David did. That's the reason he could say this. There is only one holds the future. That is who? &gt;&gt; God. &gt;&gt; So he holds the future. Let him hold you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Some people say, "But brother, brother, I have tried and I have tried." &gt;&gt; But wait a minute. Patience is virtue. Patience is holy spirit what? &gt;&gt; Virtue. &gt;&gt; They that do what? &gt;&gt; Wait upon the Lord. &gt;&gt; They shall do what? &gt;&gt; Renew their strength. &gt;&gt; You say, "How can I wait any longer?" Just keep on &gt;&gt; waiting. &gt;&gt; When you have done all you can do to stand, then do what? &gt;&gt; Stand. &gt;&gt; Just do what? &gt;&gt; Stand. &gt;&gt; How am I going to do it? &gt;&gt; Stand. &gt;&gt; He said it's the truth and it's the truth. He shall He said it shall happen. How? I don't know. But it shall happen. He said so. He promised it. If he promised it, it's going to happen. That's all. He can't wait. &gt;&gt; No matter the trial you going through. &gt;&gt; It's seasonal. &gt;&gt; After the season, there is another one season coming. &gt;&gt; Season give you hope. &gt;&gt; He hope. Hope that whatever I'm going through, &gt;&gt; have an end. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; Are we together? There's a time to be a baby. &gt;&gt; None of you remain baby. [Applause] &gt;&gt; No matter how mommy call you baby, baby, baby, baby. Today the some of you got build and everything. &gt;&gt; Mommy can't even call you baby anymore &gt;&gt; because the season has come. &gt;&gt; Before you know it, you you need to get married &gt;&gt; because the season has come. So there is a season for everything. So when you in baby season enjoy baby food, [Applause] &gt;&gt; when you are in the teenager, enjoy teenager. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When you are newly married, enjoy your time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because sooner baby will be coming and your season will change in marriage. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Last Sunday, you can take off your seat belt. &gt;&gt; If you fool, you tell me. &gt;&gt; Me, I'm fine. I'm like a fish in the water now. &gt;&gt; So, I can jump and come up. I'm fine. &gt;&gt; Amen. My battery was more than 8 hours charge. &gt;&gt; So, I'm good. &gt;&gt; The problem is not me. The problem is you. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Uh we still have time my friend. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The season the pastor is here every Sunday. &gt;&gt; So enjoy the season &gt;&gt; before the pastor get a vacation. &gt;&gt; Ah enjoy the season. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Okay. Last Sunday since we stretch up a little bit. Last Sunday we talked about someone and Mark. We found out that a tree bear fruit when &gt;&gt; in season &gt;&gt; in it season. &gt;&gt; But for some reason a question mark Jesus went out of season. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Laughter] &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; When he went out of season, he went to find fruit &gt;&gt; and there was no fruit. Instead of freeing the tree, he cursed the tree. And the Bible say it was not time for the fig yet. And brother Brandham emphasized that the word time was not really time but it was not the season yet. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And we draw from there a conclusion last Sunday that God is both in season &gt;&gt; and out of season. &gt;&gt; In other words, God expect fruit to be all the time. [Applause] I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together &gt;&gt; because when you go to the book of revelation &gt;&gt; and the last book of revelation, &gt;&gt; the tree of life is there. &gt;&gt; The Bible say the tree of life &gt;&gt; bear fruit every month. [Applause] &gt;&gt; You don't know that scripture. Amen. &gt;&gt; In other words, every month you find the fruit on the tree of life. &gt;&gt; And Jesus have a right to go every month. &gt;&gt; Lord, [Music] &gt;&gt; are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Now we begin to get we are now alert. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because when it's time for the fruit, &gt;&gt; yes, &gt;&gt; we are awake. &gt;&gt; If Jesus come, the fruit are here. If Jesus come the fruit are here but we find Jesus enter &gt;&gt; when it's not time for the fruit. &gt;&gt; Now we are nervous &gt;&gt; that God is every time &gt;&gt; even when fruit are not there. &gt;&gt; It doesn't mean he's not there. [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; I don't know. Let me let me recalibrate this. We would expect &gt;&gt; in when it's time for fruit, &gt;&gt; we expect Jesus to come. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Everybody will say, "Yes, he was hungry and there was a fruit tree over there." So, guess what? He need to go and get the fruit because it's time of the fruit. But Jesus went when he was not time of the fruit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, whoever got used &gt;&gt; to Jesus being present when fruits are there, &gt;&gt; Amen. came up with a conclusion in his own life that God only is there when there is fruit. [Music] &gt;&gt; I don't know if we together &gt;&gt; but now we find out that even if there is no time for fruit, God is there. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Here it's natural. Yes sir. Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Over here it's supernatural &gt;&gt; because this one required the third pool. [Applause] &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; If you walking through a forest, &gt;&gt; you expect to see a tree. &gt;&gt; You expect to see food. &gt;&gt; It's normal. But if you walking in the wilderness, &gt;&gt; it takes the supernatural &gt;&gt; to bring the fruit there. &gt;&gt; But God is not only the God of the forest. &gt;&gt; He's also the God of the wilderness. &gt;&gt; He's God a home. &gt;&gt; He's God a beautiful house. &gt;&gt; He's God in a prison. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. We begin to understand that God is in season &gt;&gt; and out of season. &gt;&gt; But the way we were geared, me and you, when we grow up, we know that God comes only in season. &gt;&gt; And in season, everybody get prepared. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Because it's a season. But what about if it's not a season? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What do you do? And the wisdom of Issachar &gt;&gt; discerned the season &gt;&gt; and he tells you what to do. Now let's go to Jeremiah 29 as we getting our surgery. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Glory to God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Jeremiah 29. If you there, you can say amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because somebody in season, he's ready for work. &gt;&gt; If it's not a season, what should I do? Nothing. Chill out. &gt;&gt; But Christ is there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So if it's not a season, be careful. &gt;&gt; If you're not a home, &gt;&gt; just the fact that you're not a home, &gt;&gt; be careful. The presence of the Lord is there. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Even though you're not at home, you in prison, the presence of the Lord is there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What should I do in prison? What should I do in pro house? If you there, you can say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Jeremiah 29 verse1. Let's go through the surgery. &gt;&gt; Now, these are the words of the letter that Jeremiah the prophet sent to Jerusalem to the residue or the rest of what? &gt;&gt; Elders. &gt;&gt; Continue my friend. He sent a letter to who? &gt;&gt; To the elders. Which &gt;&gt; To the elders? Continue. &gt;&gt; Which were carried away captives. &gt;&gt; Uh-huh. And what? &gt;&gt; And to the priests. &gt;&gt; And to the priests. And who else? &gt;&gt; And to the prophets. &gt;&gt; And who else? &gt;&gt; And to all the people whom Nebuchadnezzar had carried away captive. &gt;&gt; And all the people who Nebuchadnezzar did what? &gt;&gt; Had carried away captive. &gt;&gt; Now I want you to understand that all these people are captive. Amen. &gt;&gt; They were taken like prisoners. &gt;&gt; Follow me my friend. &gt;&gt; And they were captive from Israel. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; To Babylon. &gt;&gt; They move from home. These captive are in Babylon. &gt;&gt; They are in a gentile land. &gt;&gt; They are not home. &gt;&gt; We clear my friend. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What is a condition of a captive? &gt;&gt; Somebody that they took from home like Joseph, &gt;&gt; they took him from his comfort zone, &gt;&gt; from his neighborhood &gt;&gt; where he had a job and everything was going fine. War came broke destroy everything. They take him to another place. &gt;&gt; Lord, &gt;&gt; so another season open up. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm going I'm going clearly &gt;&gt; where Israel become in the season of captivity. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Father, help your church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That was verse one. Job 2 verse4, my friend. And those that were taken in captive were not only the people, &gt;&gt; the elders captive, &gt;&gt; the priest captive, &gt;&gt; the prophet captive, all the people captive, &gt;&gt; so if you go in captivity, you find priest also are captive, &gt;&gt; prophet also are there, &gt;&gt; elders also are there, &gt;&gt; everybody is already captive. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; You will ask who? &gt;&gt; If you cry to the priest, the priest is also captive. &gt;&gt; You cry to the prophet, the prophet also is in captivity. You cry to the elder, the elder is also in captivity. Who are you going to cry to? Everybody's going through the same thing. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? Job to verse four. &gt;&gt; Thus says the Lord. This is what the letter says. Amen. that saith the Lord of hosts, the God of who? &gt;&gt; Israel. &gt;&gt; To all that are carrying. In other words, God is sending a message to the captive. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; When God sent a message to the captive, everybody woke up. They said, "Whoa, Jeremiah, the major prophet of the hour, send a message coming from God. Thank you, Jesus Christ. We're going to come out of this. Deliverance is coming. Hallelujah. Praise the Lord. God finally is coming. This is my season to come out. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Verse four. Thus sayith the Lord the Lord the Lord host &gt;&gt; the Lord of host. The God of what? &gt;&gt; Israel. &gt;&gt; To all that I carried away what? &gt;&gt; Captives. &gt;&gt; Whom I have what? &gt;&gt; I have caused to do what? &gt;&gt; To be carried away. who caused Israel to be carried away. &gt;&gt; Church, I'm starting the surgery &gt;&gt; now. I already cut the the incision. Blood is coming up. So don't stop me. &gt;&gt; Okay, I need to continue. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. &gt;&gt; Who car who caused &gt;&gt; God? &gt;&gt; In other words, who was the offer? &gt;&gt; God &gt;&gt; of captivity. &gt;&gt; If he's the altar, he must be what? &gt;&gt; If he's the alpha, he must be what? &gt;&gt; Omega. If he's the labor A, he must be what? [Applause] &gt;&gt; Who caused the captivity? &gt;&gt; God. &gt;&gt; Satan. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Who cause it? &gt;&gt; God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Whom I have caused to be what? &gt;&gt; Carried away from what? &gt;&gt; Jerusalem. &gt;&gt; To who? To be what? &gt;&gt; Into Babylon. So these people move from Jerusalem &gt;&gt; to Babylon. &gt;&gt; And when the word of the Lord is coming, &gt;&gt; the first thing is that, oh, it's our season to return back to Jerusalem. &gt;&gt; We clear &gt;&gt; verse five. Uh verse five, he says, "Do what? &gt;&gt; Build ye houses." &gt;&gt; Stop. &gt;&gt; Come on now. &gt;&gt; Huh? Church, please help me. If not, I stop here. We see you next Sunday. &gt;&gt; Do what? &gt;&gt; Build ye houses. &gt;&gt; Build houses where? &gt;&gt; In Babylon. &gt;&gt; Babylon. &gt;&gt; Who saying that? &gt;&gt; God. &gt;&gt; The Lord. &gt;&gt; Built house where? &gt;&gt; Babylon. &gt;&gt; Israel. In other words, when Israel went to captivity, &gt;&gt; Israel stood there. &gt;&gt; They say, "H, build a house." No. &gt;&gt; Uh, let's put tent tent. And because sooner it's going to be easy to to rent a U-Haul &gt;&gt; and to put everything to go because if you get a mortgage right here &gt;&gt; uh you will leave the mortgage to the Babylonian. &gt;&gt; So Israel begin to live in a state of &gt;&gt; in a in a uncertainty &gt;&gt; because they're getting ready to go. Now the word of the Lord come &gt;&gt; instead of God telling them prepare to go back God say hey where you are &gt;&gt; build houses &gt;&gt; built a house there [Applause] &gt;&gt; a house where in Babylon [Music] &gt;&gt; who said that the major prophet &gt;&gt; that say the Lord &gt;&gt; why is God telling Israel to built a house. Follow me, my friend. I told you it's a major surgery &gt;&gt; for you to understand this very well. Job to verse 8 and I will come back to verse 5. &gt;&gt; Job to verse eight. &gt;&gt; Let's go, my friend. If you dare, you can say amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For what? &gt;&gt; For thus sayith the Lord of hosts. &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. The God of what? &gt;&gt; Israel. &gt;&gt; The Lord of hosts instead of the Lord of hosts. The Lord the Lord of hosts means the eternal of the Lord of the army. Yes. &gt;&gt; So when the Lord of the arm is coming for the people into captivity, he will rescue them. &gt;&gt; But the God with an army is saying build a house. &gt;&gt; Why? Let's let's let's follow this thought. Verse eight. For thus sayith the Lord, the Lord of hosts, the God of what? &gt;&gt; Israel. &gt;&gt; Let not your prophet &gt;&gt; and your what? &gt;&gt; That be in the midst of you. do what? Deceive you. &gt;&gt; So the prophet that were here, follow me my friend, &gt;&gt; were giving Israel a different instruction. [Music] &gt;&gt; I don't know if we together. &gt;&gt; God already prepared a time &gt;&gt; for captivity. There was a season for captivity. &gt;&gt; When Israel entered the season, Israel did not know what to do &gt;&gt; in the season &gt;&gt; because they had taken captive. &gt;&gt; So what do we do in the midst of this place right here? &gt;&gt; What do we do? And the prophet came &gt;&gt; that save the Lord. &gt;&gt; We will return to Israel. &gt;&gt; Israel say, "Oh, praise the Lord." Hallelujah. So, let's go to the public storage. I'm preaching in the present time. Let's rent a public storage and keep all our belongings there because in 2 years we going to in 3 years we going to go home. &gt;&gt; Then Jeremiah said no &gt;&gt; build houses. Ah &gt;&gt; father help your church &gt;&gt; and God say hey there are prophet in the midst of you &gt;&gt; that are prophesying &gt;&gt; let's continue my friend &gt;&gt; that is that are in the midst of you they are doing what &gt;&gt; they deceive you verse eight neither I can do what &gt;&gt; your dreams &gt;&gt; which you what &gt;&gt; cause to be dreamed &gt;&gt; let's go slowly &gt;&gt; dream not and Neither heart can do what &gt;&gt; your dreams. &gt;&gt; Your dreams which who cause to be dream &gt;&gt; you. &gt;&gt; So the people &gt;&gt; begin to put pressure right &gt;&gt; follow me &gt;&gt; please. Okay put your seat belts back &gt;&gt; because it's a bumpy road. The people begin to put pressure on those who have the gift &gt;&gt; to give them messages. [Applause] &gt;&gt; In other words, I don't like this place. &gt;&gt; This is not home. I'm captive in this place. &gt;&gt; I'm not comfortable. There is no McDonald here. &gt;&gt; There is no Chick-fil-A here. Please, brother Tony, you are gifted. Can you pray the Lord to tell me what really is going on in my life? &gt;&gt; And brother Tony goes to prayer and he come up. He said, "The Lord will remove you in two days. It's not going to happen." &gt;&gt; The people begin to put pressure &gt;&gt; to have dream according to the plan but not according to the season of God. Oh, glory to God. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? That's why we need to watch gifts. [Music] &gt;&gt; Gifts are corrected by the word. &gt;&gt; You must have to keep the word on top of everything. &gt;&gt; You didn't get me good. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh Jesus. &gt;&gt; These are my daughter. &gt;&gt; These are my daughter. So remove everything. &gt;&gt; I'm a single man. The sister look good. Praise the Lord.

And the sister naturally, she always smile. Sister Divine always smile. So what is your problem? How can a smile be a confirmation? [Applause] &gt;&gt; Are we together? So the people begin to put pressure on the gift to receive messages &gt;&gt; to change them from the season. &gt;&gt; Are we together? church. Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says this. He says, "I realize I'm talking to what?" &gt;&gt; 99% of Pentecostals. &gt;&gt; 99% of what? &gt;&gt; Pentecostal. &gt;&gt; Why is brother saying this? &gt;&gt; He says, "But men many times a what? &gt;&gt; A man. &gt;&gt; God deal with what? &gt;&gt; With with them. Give them a what? &gt;&gt; A gift. &gt;&gt; And people will squeeze in on those people. Especially Pentecostal. &gt;&gt; Tell me what the Lord say about me. &gt;&gt; Tell me what the Lord say about me. &gt;&gt; The word does the word say don't do it. &gt;&gt; And you go back to the can you ask the Lord's will? The word already say don't do it. How can we ask the Lord's will? [Music] &gt;&gt; The Lord said don't don't lie. And you go and you say please Lord ask the Lord should I lie or not? He says, "And the people will squeeze in in those what &gt;&gt; people &gt;&gt; if they are not perfectly called &gt;&gt; and say not called perfectly called &gt;&gt; and send of what &gt;&gt; of God. &gt;&gt; He shall cause the man &gt;&gt; or woman to say something that is not his will. &gt;&gt; Because the people do do what? &gt;&gt; Constrains them to do it. &gt;&gt; The people are putting pressure on you. &gt;&gt; Amen. I can't stand the test too long. &gt;&gt; So come up with something for me. &gt;&gt; He says how I had to catch our own leader pastor here &gt;&gt; on it. I &gt;&gt; out here in the wood one morning about what? &gt;&gt; 3:00 in the morning. &gt;&gt; The Lord told him, "Go tell brother Neville, &gt;&gt; I come to you." Didn't I, brother Neville? &gt;&gt; If he was I, I quit the church the same day. &gt;&gt; He called me from the pulpit. &gt;&gt; Amen. He said, "Didn't I, brother Neville, everybody, brother Neville, prophesy over me. Tell me this or that." See, you have him saying things that them that will not come to what? &gt;&gt; To pass. &gt;&gt; They that do what? &gt;&gt; Wait. &gt;&gt; To find out what the Lord &gt;&gt; to do, &gt;&gt; too much pressure. &gt;&gt; Let's call so and so over there. He has a gift. And sister, remember me in prayer. I'm going through something. I need to know what the will of the Lord. You already in love with the boy. &gt;&gt; If they say it's not the Lord will, will you stop? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; There is. &gt;&gt; There is your what? &gt;&gt; Five months. &gt;&gt; It's got to be what? &gt;&gt; That way. &gt;&gt; What &gt;&gt; is time? what &gt;&gt; the season &gt;&gt; when he said he will be and the man that he chose and he must come to the what? &gt;&gt; Prophet. &gt;&gt; He must be in season. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But what did Israel do? Israel went and put pressure. &gt;&gt; Prophesy for us. &gt;&gt; We don't like this place. &gt;&gt; This is a captivity right here. I'm not free. And the prophet begin to say in two years you out. In two years, a Israel say in two years we going to homeschool our children. &gt;&gt; They won't go to their school over there. You know what? We're not going to work. We will be living on our crop. We don't want to mingle with those unbeliever over here. You stay here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And God is talking now. Jump to verse 9. For they prophesy falsely to you &gt;&gt; in my name. So when somebody saying that save the Lord, don't be intimidating. &gt;&gt; Don't be intimidating. &gt;&gt; Watch what they're saying by the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't know if you understand me. &gt;&gt; If you come to me, you say, "Brother Steven, &gt;&gt; I already pick up Sister Divine on this side. So let me go on this side." So to be fair, I'm a pastor. Okay. If if somebody come and say sister Charlene, &gt;&gt; they say brother Stephen uh the Lord spoke to me about sister Charlene this this this you know the first thing I have to do. &gt;&gt; Number one I listen to your message. &gt;&gt; Number two I will check your relationship with sister Charlie. &gt;&gt; Amen. If you already got problem with sister Charlie and you hate each other for a long time, your message is questionable &gt;&gt; because I don't know if it's the Lord or if or if the abundance of your hatred. [Applause] [Music] I'm dealing with this thing, my friend. I'm dealing with this thing, my friend. So, let me layer that here. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; If you already hate Sister Lorel, &gt;&gt; I put your message in question because I don't know whether it's God or it's your hatred. &gt;&gt; You already hate the sister &gt;&gt; and you come back, the Lord say that sister will die. You already hate her. I don't know where that is coming from, but I have to to maneuver with my gun the correct way. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; God say here he says they are prophesying what &gt;&gt; a lie. I have not sent them say the Lord. Watch now verse 10. For thus say the Lord that after what? 70 years. &gt;&gt; There is already a mark time. &gt;&gt; You going to stay there 70 years. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Why? Because the law say if you overuse the land &gt;&gt; and you miss it Sabbath &gt;&gt; based on the law, the foundation of the law, God must restore 70 years to the land to take a peace. So anyone who will come with a prophecy &gt;&gt; contrary to 70 years is going against the word. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't know if we together. &gt;&gt; I don't know if we together. &gt;&gt; God say how long Israel should stay there? &gt;&gt; 70 years. &gt;&gt; 70 years. &gt;&gt; Watch my friend. Depending. Israel was 70. Yours might be two. Yours might be three. Somebody might be five, somebody might be six month. &gt;&gt; The problem is you got to know what to do. &gt;&gt; Verse uh 10. For that say the Lord that after what? &gt;&gt; 70 years &gt;&gt; shall be uh be what? &gt;&gt; Accomplished &gt;&gt; where &gt;&gt; at Babylon. &gt;&gt; And Babylon I will do what? &gt;&gt; I will visit you. &gt;&gt; Who took them to Babylon? &gt;&gt; God. &gt;&gt; Who will come to visit you? &gt;&gt; God. &gt;&gt; So who will move you from one step to another? &gt;&gt; God. &gt;&gt; Who will take you there? &gt;&gt; God. If you push, &gt;&gt; you going to go yourself. &gt;&gt; And God is stay behind. &gt;&gt; You didn't get me, my friend. &gt;&gt; You didn't get me, my friend. &gt;&gt; If you live a 50 years, &gt;&gt; you will go without God. &gt;&gt; Because remember where you move is where God is. [Applause] &gt;&gt; If you were home, you move in puller house. Where is God? Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If you move from Portifer to the prison, where is God? &gt;&gt; If you move from the prison to Pharaoh house, where is God? &gt;&gt; If you move from Israel to Babylon, where did God go? &gt;&gt; Babylon. &gt;&gt; Why is God telling you built in Babylon? So where is God? [Applause] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Father, uh, let me see. Give me one second. Give me one second. I need to stabilize somebody quick. &gt;&gt; Oh, Lord of hosts. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Give me one second. Uh, flip your Bible. Go to chapter 27. &gt;&gt; Quick, my friend, so we can go. &gt;&gt; You there? Chapter 27:E 6. And now I have given what? &gt;&gt; All this land into the hand of who? &gt;&gt; Nebuchadnezzar. Who took Israel captive? &gt;&gt; Nebuchadnezzar. &gt;&gt; God is saying, I give all the land to Nabuh unto the into the hand of who? &gt;&gt; Nebuchadnezzar. &gt;&gt; The king of what? &gt;&gt; Babylon. &gt;&gt; Who? &gt;&gt; My servant. &gt;&gt; Nebuchadnezzar is the servant of who? [Music] &gt;&gt; Please answer me. Nebuchadnezzar is the the servant of who? &gt;&gt; God. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. So Pifer was working for who? &gt;&gt; The Lord. &gt;&gt; The Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Pifer was working for who? &gt;&gt; Let's go back where we were, my friend. &gt;&gt; We on 29, my friend. &gt;&gt; We there. &gt;&gt; We there. &gt;&gt; He said 70 years must be fulfilled, accomplished at Babylon. And I will do what? &gt;&gt; Visit you. &gt;&gt; I will visit you and do what? &gt;&gt; Perform my good word. my good word toward you in causing you to do what? &gt;&gt; Return to this. &gt;&gt; So who's going to bring Israel back? &gt;&gt; The Lord. &gt;&gt; In other word, the one who initiate the captivity &gt;&gt; is God. &gt;&gt; And when he's initiating the trial, &gt;&gt; he's also preparing the way out of that trial. &gt;&gt; I don't know if we're getting that. I'm the one taking you to Babylon. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Stay there. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Because the one that took you there is my servant &gt;&gt; even though he's a hidden. &gt;&gt; He's working for me. &gt;&gt; In other words, I have everything under control in Babylon. &gt;&gt; I know it's going to shock you. &gt;&gt; I know it's going to shock you. Amen. &gt;&gt; You going to Babylon, the king there is my servant. &gt;&gt; I am the one who gave him all the land. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And I have a scripture there. I'm trying to save time. God told the king of Israel, if you don't put your neck under Babylon, you will perish. &gt;&gt; Everybody under Babylon. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; I'm the one taking you there. &gt;&gt; And I'm the one who's going to take you up. In other word, when you're going, I'm going with you. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Job to verse 14. And then we come back up again. &gt;&gt; And I will be what? &gt;&gt; Found of you. &gt;&gt; Say the Lord. And I will do what? &gt;&gt; Turn away your captivity. &gt;&gt; Go back again. He say, I will be what? &gt;&gt; Found in you. &gt;&gt; What does God say? &gt;&gt; God will be what? &gt;&gt; Of you. But if you go before time and you search God, &gt;&gt; God will hide from you. &gt;&gt; I don't know if you understand, &gt;&gt; but when the season of deliverance come, God will be fond of you. In other words, God is looking for you. When you go this way, he say, "I'm here. I'm here. I'm here." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; So what happened? Israel carried away captive. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For a period of time. And when they get there in captivity among them they have prophet &gt;&gt; and priest and divine they begin to give them messages that they going to go back. &gt;&gt; Now the the the message now is confusing. &gt;&gt; The major prophet say 70. &gt;&gt; These are saying two years. Even ananiah die &gt;&gt; he say two years and the lord kill him. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Now the major prophet send instruction. Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "Hey, don't stay like people who are in the air. &gt;&gt; Don't because there is a difference. If you come here &gt;&gt; and we tell you that on Tuesday you will go &gt;&gt; if you have a luggage, you won't you won't open everything &gt;&gt; because you need to keep your luggage a certain way &gt;&gt; because on Tuesday you must make sure everything is packed so you can go. But if they tell you in six months you go, you will unload everything &gt;&gt; because you have a lot of time. So when they told Israel, it's a short period of time. Israel stay with their luggage. &gt;&gt; Some were sleeping at the airport. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Now the word of the Lord come. Let's go back to verse five. My time is pretty much up. I need to drop. We there. Verse five. The word of the Lord came to the people that were carrying what? captive. God says what? &gt;&gt; Building houses &gt;&gt; and dwelling that &gt;&gt; can we can we read together? &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; God is saying what? &gt;&gt; Build houses &gt;&gt; where Babylon. &gt;&gt; If God instructs you to build a house, &gt;&gt; it is not you who want to build a house. &gt;&gt; God is telling you, you see where you were, build a house there. What does he mean? The blessing of the Lord is right there. &gt;&gt; In other words, if you go back to the promised land, &gt;&gt; you will you will you will suffer. &gt;&gt; Father, help this church. &gt;&gt; Let me start it again. &gt;&gt; As much as you want to go to the promised land, &gt;&gt; if you go to the promised land &gt;&gt; out of season, in other words, God is telling you, I'm in Babylon. &gt;&gt; I'm in. I am the one that is blessing Nebuchadnezzar. &gt;&gt; My blessing is upon Nebuchadnezzar. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Nebuchadnezzar is my servant. &gt;&gt; Since there is a curse in Israel because Israel trespass, I'm moving you where my blessing is. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I hope you we are together. &gt;&gt; But Israel is caught up with the word captive. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm a captive. &gt;&gt; I'm a captive. &gt;&gt; I'm a prisoner. I'm a p. Forget about the prisoner. Can a prisoner be a manager? &gt;&gt; Can a captive built a house? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; So you're not really captive. &gt;&gt; It is a different season. &gt;&gt; A season for the gentile. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Let me start again. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God told Nebuchadnezzar, &gt;&gt; I'm giving. He told Jeremiah, I'm blessing Nebuchadnezzar, every nation under him. &gt;&gt; If I go back to the scripture, he even said that Nebuchadnezzar will reign and his children will reign and his children and kings will come from there. &gt;&gt; In other words, there is a time and he says until his reign be to an end. Amen. &gt;&gt; But because the blessing of the Lord are going there, &gt;&gt; sir, &gt;&gt; Israel is under curse. &gt;&gt; Because they overuse the land, &gt;&gt; God chose a captive &gt;&gt; and moved them out &gt;&gt; and bring them to Babylon. &gt;&gt; And when they brought to Babylon, they came with the mentality of a captive. A captive is somebody who is away &gt;&gt; and who have a tendency to free himself to go back. &gt;&gt; Now God came he said remove that mentality. &gt;&gt; I am where you are. &gt;&gt; You see the house of pifer I am right there. &gt;&gt; Open your eyes. &gt;&gt; Find some real estate. [Music] Let me go back again because our point is we in Babylon. &gt;&gt; Why don't you work? I'm in Babylon. &gt;&gt; Remember Israel went there and they asked them to sing. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Do you remember that? &gt;&gt; It's in Psalm 100 20 something. They asked them to sing because when Israel, Ira, Babylon, they took the their harp and they laid them on the willow. &gt;&gt; They say we can't sing. And the people come, they say, "Sing us. Go ahead. It's your season." Isaiah say, "Huh? How can we sing the song of Zion &gt;&gt; in a strange land?" They didn't know God was in that strange land. &gt;&gt; In other words, I sing it my season everywhere I'm going. [Applause] Are we together? &gt;&gt; Because everywhere the soul of my foot get &gt;&gt; God have given to me. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? The plan of 70 is God. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Israel is sitting there without instruction and the prophet send the instruction. He said tell the people that are there. &gt;&gt; The demand is always the day we will return to Zion. &gt;&gt; The day we will go back to Israel. &gt;&gt; Can we go to McDonald? No, no, no. Not at this time. Wait till we go back to Zion. Wait till they go back to So everything, every anointing that is in the house of piper, &gt;&gt; that is in the prison, Israel doesn't see that &gt;&gt; because their mind is they cursed me away from my father. They took me away from my mother. My brother did this and God is working and God send instruction. He say hey remove the mentality. &gt;&gt; Open your eyes. &gt;&gt; I am the one that took you where you are. &gt;&gt; You see the place you are in your life. &gt;&gt; I'm the one that took you there. &gt;&gt; You see where you are now in your life. &gt;&gt; You didn't get me. &gt;&gt; Some of you want to go home. &gt;&gt; You see where you are.

Father, may you come down in the heart of every believer, everyone that is listening online. Lord, Father, may this wisdom be granted to all of us. Father, you know what each person is going through their life, their individual life. Lord, you know their specific season. You know the time that they going through, what they going through. You know, because you took them there and you're going to take them out. But father, may they seize the opportunity. May they take advantage of the season where they are instead of sitting. But may Lord, Father, the Holy Spirit guide them through divine precise instruction that will hotel them and let them seize whatever you have planned for them in the time that they're going through. Lord, I pray that you give them a special blessing for staying over time. Lord, Father, strengthen our body and protect us. And may you protect my wife as she's going to get ready to come back. May Lord, Father, you give her travel mercy. Lord take Lord Father this oncoming weekend to thy hand. Bless us Lord Father in the name of Jesus Christ.
