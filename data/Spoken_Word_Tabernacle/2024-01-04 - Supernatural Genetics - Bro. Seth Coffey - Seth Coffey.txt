TRANSCRIPT
========================================
the wheat the wheat has to come Plumb back as it starts maturing from the grain where it rotted died and come forth and kept coming up from grass into something else you can't go back to Grass don't point back to Grass don't point back to this don't point back to the Sheep come on till you get to the wheat and the wheat has to be the same kind of wheat that went into the ground when it's matured Jesus is raised from the dead he's matured now and he's matured in his church through justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost through these reformers in the early days now here he is on today and his people believing he's here just that you might see you might be strangers May the god of Heaven honor what I've said about you now I want you in the audience please don't nobody go out

brother Josh a happy 25 first birthday happy birthday brother Josh amen and they also um ask for prayers for sister D and Victoria they both are under the weather amen so if you see our brother kma alone know that yeah amen amen and then there's also um a prayer request for our brother Jeffrey Johnson I believe we know brother Jeffrey Johnson and his wife said they'll be going to Ghana she's been here for treatment and she's been here around for treatment and they're going back to Ghana so they want uh we've been asked to remember them in prayer Amen brother Jeffrey Johnson amen we have a testimony from Brother Charles and we're going to invite brother Charles to give a testimony and then after that pray uh and thank the Lord for his testimony and for brother Josh and then bring for the Lord our prayer request tonight so after the testimony and pray God bless you everyone all right um I want to give this testimony because I was struggling in my body on the last service yes and normally I don't get sick normally I'm the one that encourages everybody um the Lord taught us how to fight the devil you know he uh there's a time where brother brandom said when Satan talks to you he said use it you use what he says to you so normally if if my body gets attacked it only lasts maybe two or three days because I make sure I apply the word so what I normally do is if I cough I said thank you for my healing Lord every every time I'm serious every time every time something happens if he start coming to my mind I said yeah I'm yeah I'm sick but he said I'm Healed too so which one you want to use you know that's that that that's how I learned to fight the devil so it never last but it didn't happen like that this time so I said okay Lord something ain't right that I missed the Mark or something I didn't know what was going on because normally it's already gone so I said okay Lord I said I don't know what's going on but I'm I I'm believe I'm Healed and when I made it to service I couldn't I couldn't say Amen the way I wanted to I was I said M that's that's the best I can do but I wanted to show Satan whose side I was on if I can if I can go to work and get paid or do something of of pleasure that I want to do then I can come to church so what I did was I said okay I'm I'm I'mma go anyway and and I try to praise my way but the thing that was so profound to me is when this body of Believers saw that we weren't here sister Bridget de called and to uh encourage my wife gave us some remedies and she prayed and man that's just to pray that's sister prayed and you know we were all encouraged and after that when I was going through it brother khem had pulled me aside he said brother you know and I'm like man these some real Believers you know these people ain't playing Church These some real Believers you know so I was encouraged you know cuz I wasn't going through the fight alone so I said okay I I said okay I got to church I still couldn't move the way I wanted to move my precious brother here he saw me struggling and this is love he picked up all of the tissues he didn't not it wasn't no snot on him now but but he didn't know that right he didn't know that he picked him up from me and walked into the back you understand cuz I couldn't move man that's love I I appreciate that and I know the Lord saw that and I pray the Lord grant you a special blessing my brother cuz that was that was dear to me so I knew if I could take communion I knew I would be healed and when brother Stephen the Lord anointed him to say that I said okay my healing is coming so when I took the communion I couldn't even get the cup out this this house is where brother I couldn't even get the cup out it was stuck so I said okay this this is a real test for me right now so when I finally got the cup out and and uh took the uh communion you know I started feeling the effects on my body just shifting and by the time I got home everything just started working out for the better so I thank the Lord for all of my body Believers I thank the Lord for everyone encouraging us but most of all I thank Jesus Christ because if I couldn't recognize the word and all of these Believers and where would I see it at because that means it's still on the pages you see so and the last last thing I want to say is if you have a testimony my brothers and sisters please give it I want to say these last two things by God's grace when brother Zach and his precious wife gave that testimony my wife and my children when we go home from service we fellowship and say hey what did you get out of service you know how did you feel about it and so forth so as we were talking about it I said that that testimony just did something for me you know and I told her I said something else I said you know cuz I was praying or something and she said sweetheart she said the Lord told me to go pray because you were praying right and the testimony he gave was she didn't know he didn't know his wife was over there praying as well but that was a correction for her because ever since then she's been hearing his voice more clearly now so when you give testimonies we don't know how to inside teacher going to interpret that testimony to the body of Believers that are hearing it you know and the last thing I want to say for myself when brother uh Seth and his wife gave their testimony about how he he walked past that that monitor and said your days are numbered well y'all gonna laugh at me because I would rub my stomach every day and and and I would tell them I said brother I'mma use that I'mma use that because it's the word made flesh I believe that with all my heart you know cuz we got to be walking Bibles that's what we're taught so if he did it for you that lets me know how unlimited he is so I'm using everyone so I rub on my stomach and I said your days are number I do it I said your day are numbered so from that time I was 267 I'm 238 now so always give the testimonies always give the testimonies because we are the word made flesh now amen let us pray I love y'all y'all I love y'all so much it's beautiful to be among the gods Amen Let us let us pray family let us pray oh precious Heavenly Father how can we thank you enough for everything you're doing in our lives father Lord just to see that your word father is always fresh it's always renewing Lord God it's always strengthening us to Lord Jesus Christ and father to be involved Lord God with such a body of Believers as this father Lord I'm eternally grateful Lord God and I thank you

father and cause Lord those that are around to hunger and thirst after thy righteousness Lord God that they might be filled Lord God that they might have a word Lord God to give unto them heavenly father that they might be refreshed and strengthened Lord Jesus Christ father we commit this service into thy hands heavenly father that you can take it Lord God and use it Lord God to reveal the mystery that you desire to unfold unto us on today Heavenly Father even decoding Lord God the message within the message Lord by the inside teacher because you promise Lord Jesus Christ that we will

here Lord in Jesus Christ's name amen amen sorry to keep you standing amen the scripture reads this way it says and I want to preach on a a text tonight of Supernatural genetics Supernatural genetics amen and it says behold what manner of love the father has bestowed upon us that we should be called the sons of God Amen therefore the world knoweth us not you wonder why you're odd amen because it knew him not and it says beloved now we are the sons of God so somebody just tell the devil who you are you're not you're not just nobody but you're the Sons and Daughters of almighty God tonight and it doeth not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him why can I say because we're going to have his same genetics amen for we shall see him as he is now you may be seated here I'm going to read in Ephesians here and it says Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ by the will of God to the Saints which are at Ephesus and to the faithful in Christ Jesus Grace be to you and peace from our father H and from the Lord Jesus Christ blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us with all spiritual blessings and Heavenly places in Christ according a has chosen Us in him yesterday no at the next Revival no but chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be now listen when the Bible says something's going to happen and it says you should be holy and Without Blame before him in love it's going to happen it's not a if it's not a maybe now listen here in job it said then the Lord answered job out of a whirlwind and said who is this that darken the councel by the words without knowledge G up thy loins like a man for I will demand of thee an answer of thou me where was thou when I laid the foundations of the earth declare if thou Hast understanding who hath laid the measures thereof if thou knowest or who hath searched the line stretched the line upon it whereupon are the foundations thereof fastened or who laid the Cornerstone thereof when the morning Stars sang together and all Al all the sons of God shouted for Joy listen to what brother Brenham said he said notice he is in me and I in him notice in every Christian yes sir that's a real genuine Christian yes my brother was with him yes sir not at the last Revival not about not at your last failure not at your last mistake come on preacher my brother but the genuine Christian was with him when the morning Stars sang together together and the sons of God shouted for Joy yes sir before there was a foundation of the world we were identified yes sir in the immortal Realms with God 10 million years before the world was ever formed yes sir I was back there with him if I've got eternal life I was there with him remember Church eternal life is not something that starts on a certain day but Eternal is a circle if you ever was you always was amen right preach I was identified with him yes sir when the morning Stars sang together and the sons of God right shouted for Joy amen he says now if you ever be there you was with him then for there's only one form of eternal life and that's God and you had to be a part of God at the beginning so church you can see what I've tried to show you is where our genetics begin yes my brother where our genetics start our our genetics don't start on any day but it actually started before the day our genetics actually started all the way back before the foundation of the world now now I want to show you this in contrast if we look at it on this side let's look at the devil's genetics for a moment well that'd be all right now in John 8:44 I'm laying a background here we'll get going here in a minute take your time but in John 8:44 it feels hard trying to put a background when you have to when brother Steven can lay stuff out you're probably going to be going what is he talking about but you just pray for me but but but in John 8:44 Jesus would say ye are of your father the devil that's right and the lust of your father ye will do he was a murderer from the beginning yes sir what was it when they said of Cain he was of that Wicked one yes my brother God Almighty came to him lip to ear and he began to say if you do just do as your brother does and it'll be well with you but the genetic on the inside of him of that pride and and and and that lust and wanting to be the right one and the jealousy that rose up in him you see it wasn't the right genetic to begin with if I can say it this way it wasn't the right seed it was never the right seed in the beginning and it said you are of that that Wicked one from the beginning he was a murderer and when God came and spoke to him lip to ear there was something that rose up in him and he said I can't believe you're telling me how to live my life I can't believe you're telling me that I have to obey what you say I've made an offering I came to church I did what la la but he couldn't come under subjection to the word of God because his lineage never went back to the word of God yes my brother yes sir and abold not in the truth because there is no truth in him amen when he speaketh a lie he speaketh of his own for he is a liar and the father of it and because I tell you the truth truth uhhuh you believe me not now listen Church don't you ever get that in your head that the truth is going to be popular but the truth will still be the truth amen and because I tell you the truth ye believe me not which of you convince me of sin and if I say the truth why do you not believe me that's it he that is of god Heth God's words ye therefore hear them not because ye are not of God so Jesus is looking at the Pharisees and he said you don't know me because you're not a part of me yes my brother now yes sir listen Church take your time I am the expressed image of my father amen I was in my father's loins I can show you of a a picture of my father in the 80s uhuh I was with him uhhuh but you couldn't see me that's exactly right I was therey I wasn't born till the '90s yeah I'm just a kid I say that you know I'm kind of in that awkward place of not a kid anymore and not really sure if I'm an adult 28 years old you know but but you know I can show you a picture of my father there in the 80s and I can say well there I am uhhuh right there I was and you say well I don't see a picture of you but yet I was there that's ex I was there in seed form you couldn't see me but I was there you know all of my genetics everything that I would ever be here in 2024 was in that seed yes brother everything that I would ever be you know how tall I would be was in that seat 511 and2 as bad as I wanted to be 6' tall 511 and a half was in that seed and that is what I was going to be yes my brother how I would sound when I would speak was in that seed how big my ears would be was in that seed sir all that I am glory to God all that I am was in that seed then SE I don't remember it go but I was there yes my brother glory on May 23rd 1995 I was in my mother's womb I don't remember it but I was there but on May 24th I was born in this world I don't even remember that but I was there brother exactly right as I got older though yes sir I begin to grow up in life and people didn't have to tell me hey act like your daddy I begin to act like my daddy why because the SE Gene of my father was on the inside of me as I got older I begin to express the characteristics of the genan yes my brother that was in me and I couldn't help it it was just who I am my it's just who I am it just comes out of me there's just something in me that that that I can't help it but but it produces Mark coffee that's exactly right because the seed on the inside of it I must sat no matter how much it drives me crazy I can't deny that that's my father I like my father I look like my father I talk like my father I walk in a room and my mom goes wow that was weird I thought you were your daddy why because it was the seed yes my brother all the way back being manifest yes my brother you know what it is you me tell you the secret of it go ahead now see you don't look like my father uhhuh because you don't have representation of my father but I look like my father because I have reput representation of my father living on the inside of me yes my brother now brother brandom keep moving man I hope I get I hope I get somewhere tonight brother brandom speaks he uses a parable here he speaks of the woman at the well in the priest and he begins to draw on the Blackboard he said now this little part here that looks like Blackboard see that represents his Purity uhhuh he was a priest he was an honorable man that was you know somebody that had legalist down P he he had everything right but down in his heart there wasn't no love amen he was he was of that Wicked one that re that represented this he was also he had to be a good man or he couldn't be a priest but you see how he got it was intellectual can I say carnal learning never had a revelation uhhuh notice when Jesus came and manifested the word because the word is a discerner of the thoughts that was in the heart as Hebrews 4 says Hebrews 4:12 that he would the word was a discerner of the thoughts of the heart and he came as the son of man the prophet what happened the priest with only intellectual learning he said it's a devil and we've heard that a lot he had no representation so it blacked him out he didn't believe the word because the word was not in him yes my brother there was no representation in that priest even though he he might have had all the gifts you know I believe in the scripture there in in the Corinthians it talks about if I have all the gifts if I can prophesy if I know all the Mysteries but I don't have love and God is love and God is the word and the Word was made manifest and dwelt Among Us so he didn't have the word he didn't have love he didn't have representation my brother yes sir he didn't have Supernatural genetic yes my brother yes my brother he didn't believe the word because the word was not in him but this little woman at the well uhuh she didn't have no gifts to show no sir no sir she couldn't say I brought this many people to Christ no sir she couldn't say my attendance is perfect but she had one thing on the inside of her my brother she had representation she had Supernatural genetics on the inside of her Hallelujah you know I I just want to say this tonight I'm so glad that God used people in the Bible that didn't have it all together I'm so glad that God used people like Peter in the Bible that I can read his mistakes but I can also read where he went by a gate called beautiful and there was a lame man and there was a genetic on the inside of him yes my brother I said Silver and Gold Have I None but this Supernatural genetic that I have I to you freely rise and walk in the name of Jesus Christ yes my brother Hallelujah glory to God but this little woman at the well had nothing to present she was filthy and as dirty as could be but notice way down in her she's got representation aen glory glory to God what is that representation preach my brother a betrayal of of someone or something in particular a way of being a certain nature a certain nature yes my brother she said sir not you're be El I perceive that you are a prophet yes my brother now we know that the Messiah which is called Christ will come and when he does he'll do this he said I am he yes my brother no more doubt no sir you didn't have to explain it we got too many people W everything explained to them this is by faith amen amen but let me tell you something when you got faith yes sir on the inside of you yes sir the substance you don't have to have everybody explaining something to you no sir no more doubt you didn't have to explain it she saw it believed it away she went why what did it do to her it redeemed her amen the word in her identified I put I wrote that down that's mine just so you don't get it confused the word inside of her that's it identified with the word in front of her can I say it this way it was a deep call to the deep and there was a deep to respond why because she listen her her her identity wasn't formed on that day at the well but her identity was before the foundation of the world when Jesus knew her just like that little woman that was caught in a very Act of adultery that's exactly right preach my and every holy person socalled dragged that little girl up to Jesus and said the the law say she ought to be stoned but what do you say what do you say about this woman do you know this woman you can call me crazy but I believe he dug down in the sand and went through the Lamb's Book of Life till he found some representation for that girl right there and he said I'll tell you what whichever one of you without sin cast the first stone preach my brother it didn't matter that's it it didn't matter at if the priest represented her no it didn't matter if her natural father represented her but you know what mattered that the one without sin was her representation ammen the one without sin he said neither do I condemn you yes my brother glor she could be redeemed because she was his in the first place she see that that those scribes and Pharisees had no say over her because that was not their property that's exactly but that was God's almighty's Property glory to God it redeemed her now watch he came to be a redeemer is that right congregation says yes my brother what does redeem mean bring back why didn't he get that priest he never was up there see he had no representation am he came to redeem that which had fallen in the fall yes sir this got messed up with that girl but God had her in his thinking before the foundation of the world and he come to cleanse her see then he said she had eternal life amen church I think this perfectly describes it okay I identify with my father because I'm a part of my father and brother brandham uses this illustration in in in spiritual Amnesia and and he says he says to be an American I landed on Plymouth Rock with her with the forefathers I had to I'm a part of her I wrote with Paul rever a Warner of her dangers if I'm a real American citizen I landed on Plymouth Rock you see what he's saying everything that America is an American
