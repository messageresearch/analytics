TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] god bless you all this this evening somebody's happy to be here in the hospital you may say it's not it's a it's a hotel it's where the lord meets us every sunday wednesday so it's the house for us i'm grateful to be here this has just been the last week or two it's just been a really trying week for me it seems like everything in life always seems to hit all at once and it just started with my car the situation in my car and the accident and then just one thing after another and it started to get me discouraged but i just started to think about you know i spent some time in prayer last night just thanking the lord i'm like lord no matter what happens no matter what is or no matter how rough the situation might get i know you're still the same yesterday and forever everything i have is because of you and if everything is taken away from me i'll still praise you nothing satan can attack me all he wants but he's not going to gain a i spent time and god just you know did something for me last night and i was just i came up from my knees i was just so grateful i was like lord forgive me for being discouraged there's no reason for us to be discouraged we know we know the end from the beginning and we know we're predestinated and we know he's got it all in control so no matter how the situation might get just know he's got control and you can rest in that that's why us as believers we can just have peace joy comfort and uh i had a guy from work quit um i know i'm talking about y'all forgive me but i had a guy from work quit just recently at the job and he got on the phone with me and he told me he's like hey i i never told you this while we worked together but i'm going to tell you now and i just say this for the glory of god but just because i was going through a hard time god used this as a comfort but he said i've never in my life met somebody that has been so peaceful so joyful so content so happy he said every day you come into work you have a smile on your face no matter what might go on and he said i just called you and he said he said i called you and i asked you how you were doing and you said you were doing great god is good you're blessed and he's like but i was just told by one of our co-workers that you just totaled your car and you didn't have anything but liability and you were out thousands of dollars but yeah when i called you you said everything was great and i was like well that's just my testimony god's been good to me no matter what happens he's good and that just it stood out to him he's like that's that stood out to me from the second i've worked here until now and he's like and i want you to know that i'll stick with me for the rest of my life and i was just like lord thank you thank you for that that was that was for me just to encourage me that you know how no matter how hard satan might hit no matter how much you might get down you just know that god's got all in control we're blessed we're a blessed people if anything just to be here on sunday and wednesday and hear the word and to see god continuing to move and unveil and reveal his word is just a blessing but we're going to go ahead

enter into an atmosphere of worship lord trusting you lord to continue to bring your word continue to meet with us lord lord knowing that you're the same lord and i'm expecting this evening to hear from you so i just ask that you help me to enter in lord myself lord i want more of you lord i want a greater desire to serve you lord i want a refilling of your holy spirit lord and i know these things are there for me lord but it's my job to take a step towards them lord to pursue it because we can say over and over that we want more holy ghosts or who want a closer walk but if we don't make the steps towards it lord you can't do it for us because you've already done it for us it's lies in front of us it's a gift that you've given and we have to receive it so i just ask this evening lord for myself and for the church included this evening help us just to receive your gift lord your gift of the holy spirit lord your grace and your mercy lord and not to make your grace disgrace lord but

me a testimony came into his mind so he would like to speak it come on my brother let's give it a couple three minutes would you hand me my microphone you might be standing anyway you can stay appreciate you two three minutes god bless you thanks just a quick testimony i want to hold you up um for the last month or so since the last uh what 16th of last month i've been to amazon for about a year and a half and it's a lot of demons i dealt with every day the homosexuality all of it so um i got out of character one night with a co-worker and um for weeks i've been battling this battling and from what i've learned i've come i've come up under the word of god and and that's the strongest shield we have right now like the world right now is in fear that's why we're going through a lot of stuff that fear and that hatred so i was sitting in the back and i was praying and i've been praying i've been praying and i got a phone call and i just stepped out and it was the head of hr and she told me from after everything they investigated she told me to come back to work monday amen you can't tell me it's no god you can't tell me god is not real god told me prayer answers everything prayer answers everything i'm telling you and i'm telling you because it was a whole week i felt and i talked to my father it was a thickness every time i step in that building because it's people that i've noticed and i told him one day it's more people some people in that world got more faith than people in the church and and people don't realize that and that that's what god took me out of that he told me it's my time and you have to look i'd have been in so many situations and and i want to hold you up if god permit i'll have more more testimonies later on but when i got that phone call and it came up no caller id that's why i didn't answer i never answer phone calls no call id and if someone told me go back their answer and i sent the email and it was my hr and she said come back to work monday she said because i found no no no clue no evidence of anything that you did wrong she said i'll see you on monday night and i appreciate [Applause] hallelujah praise the name of the lord it happened right in church so it's good to be in church amen when the anointing dropped something touched the hr [Applause] it is it is the holy ghost [Applause] amen praise the name of the lord we greet you all in the name of jesus christ i'm no longer a stranger and we don't have visitors here so whoever is here there is no visitor we always have family members amen so feel at home feel free and let's get back straight to the word ultra willing this sunday morning it's something that we have uh planned already and uh scheduled for it brother andrew glover will be preaching for us this sunday morning so you know brother andrew glover pretty good amen yeah that's uh somebody who knows how to handle the machine gun [Laughter] amen so stay in prayer for the service and we believe by the grace of god it's going to be a wonderful service by the grace of god so genesis chapter 38 we touch on this before but last sunday we stopped with the sovereignty of god so everybody knows how to break into that sovereignty if you can break into it it's not my fault you have been given the keys to break into the sovereignty of god just worship stay in the atmosphere prayer worship meditation before you know it the holy spirit will come amen somebody get into the atmosphere of worship tonight and he received a phone call amen why did it happen sometime maybe tomorrow or before church nothing happened by any chance to the believer genesis 38 verse 13 if you dare you can say amen and it was told tamar you know about this now saying behold your father in law goes up not down to timna to share the ship we already spoke about this sharing of the ship you know what it means without shearing you cannot enter into the holy you might be seated verse 14 and she put her widow's garment off from her just like blind bartimaeus and cover her we fever we know what he means should surrender her head amen it's the time of the shearing the shearing of wool and she took off her widow's garment amen she had a head but she coupled that with a veil she veiled her head meaning there is no headship anymore in other words she has surrendered her self-will or her free moral agency amen she has she's not thinking on her own anymore she has a different head if the head said to the right she moved to the right amen it's like when you're trusting gps you don't use your brain if gps say make a right make a right make a left make a left exit exit if you don't want to listen you're going to get lost amen and rob herself and sat in an open place which is by the way to tim now for she saw that sheila was grown and she was not given to him as a wife let's go to the song of solomon in this church we look at everywhere in the bible because the seals has been open we have no restriction amen song of solomon chapter six if you're there you can say amen i hope i'm gonna get where i want it to verse one where is your beloved gone or fairest among women so they are women but this one is the fairest right when they say fairest means she's the top right she's above every other woman where is my beloved gone oh you fairest among women where is your beloved turn aside that we may seek him with you jump to verse eight there are three score in other words 60 queens right the first category is a queen we're dealing with feste right there are two score screens and four score in other words eddie concubines that's the second category everybody there and the third category is virgins it is a category for queen queen is a position right amen there are four three score twins and four score concubines and virgins without number so you have those three categories either you're a concubine or you're just a virgin or you're a queen right verse nine my dove my undefined perfect one is but what that's why she's the first so regardless of the numbers of queens regardless of the number of conkey man or virgin this woman is only one you cannot have two my undefiled is that one just like he oh israel the lord your god is what one god she is the only one of her mother the dancer has siblings she was the only one of her mother she is the only one of her mother she is the choice one not only is she the only one but she is the choice one the chosen here comes the bride she is the chosen one you know that song sister amen my daughter mahandi phil is about one she is the only one of her mother she is the choice one of her that bought her the daughters saw her and blessed her yeah the queens and the cocky bands and they praise her so there is something special about this lady that when somebody sees her she's always pleasing to people amen there is a kind of grace or favor going on around this lady amen praise the name of the lord let's go to matthew 25. hallelujah we spoke on sunday on the sovereignty of god which is the first key to the third pool right now we're gonna blend from the sovereignty we will find an intersection a preparation to the line of duty that's what we're doing tonight how can you move from there to the line of duty then next sunday we pick up on the line of dude itself amen matthew 25 then shall the kingdom of heaven be like and two ten virgins which took their lamp and went forth to meet the bridegroom so they went they all went to meet the bride room if you judge them right there all of them go to heaven just like oprah and roof both of them were on the way to judah but on the midway opera went back right and five of them were wise and five were foolish five of them were wise and five were foolish [Music] if you look at them all of them are virgins all of them look good you got to test their wisdom amen they thou are foolish took their lamps and took no oil with them so their valley was manifested by the lack of oil amen [Music] if you check them everything is good except they own but the wise took all in their vessels with their lamps while the broad groom terry there is a delay they all slumbered and slept and at the midnight there was a cry which means a shout a message so this prophecy really is completely fulfilled in the end time amen made behold the bridegroom cometh because when the church ages started at the beginning with paul there was no marriage paul said i inspired you into christ everybody clear but the marriage take at the end of the church ages that's when the bridegroom cometh that's when we are going to the marriage supper anybody clear so it's applied to the end time then all those virgins arose all of them and trimmed their lamps and the foolish said to the wise givers of your oil for our lamps are gone out at the wrong time but the wise answered saying not so lest there be not enough for us and you but you go rather to them that sell and buy for yourself it's an individual affair and while they went to buy the bridegroom came and there they were ready they were ready bad have made herself you see who was ready so the five that were ready are the bride it's right there in your scripture that's your bread this is still a church but it's not the bride amen praise the name of the lord make herself ready uh that were already went in with her to the marriage and the door was shut closed after all it came all also the other virgin saying lord lord this kind of calling belongs to the gentile son of david lord he opened up lord lord have we not cast devil gentle are we there lord lord open to us but he answered and said verily i said to you i know you not everybody clear praise the name of the lord let's pray it's on wednesday so let's take it 35 miles an hour amen heavenly father lord we thank you again father for your grace you love your mercy and for everything you're doing for us lord you have given us a great opportunity to be lord father gather together around the revealed word of the hour in church tonight father we thank you for solving the problem for my brother and we thank you for everything you're doing in each family of this church lord we are committing this service unto the hand father may you move me completely out of the way may you come and speak to your children may your anointing flow freely lord may you remove every demonic spirit lord father may you remember those online that are streaming some of them going to work some of them coming from work and have difficulty but father may you minister to each one of them lord we committed all in the name of jesus christ amen all right god bless you now we last sunday we we were dealing with part eight we already know about the benefits of judah the first one which we already dealt with the barley and the wheat the golden scepter the royal priesthood the signet where we are still dealing with it once we finish the segment then we will go to the bracelet and to the child we already deal with the three pretty much we are still dealing with the fourth one and the last sunday we dealt with the sovereignty of god now today we're gonna get on part nine where we will touch up a little bit on that priesthood to get a transition that's the reason why i had to go back to uh uh tamar everybody clear now when we just read the scripture in matthew 25 we found out that the difference between the foolish version and the wise virgin was the oil but all those women were virgins everybody clear brother branham helped me in the 10 virgins and 144 000. brother brandon preached a message and he tagged that message the 10th virgin everybody clear and the 144 000 within among those virgins five of them are wise which makes the bride and five of them are foolish everybody clear so this message speaks about three categories of people it's talking about the bride gentile everybody clear that goes into the rapture it's talking about the nominal church gentile that misses the rupture and goes into tribulation everybody clear and he spoke also about the 144 000 which are dealt with in the tribulation period everybody clear now brother bonham say so the greek word for clean is sanctified the hebrew word is holy holy clean and sanctified is all the same word so this was not filthy dirty church they're a virgin it was a sanctified clean church tenth virgin went out to meet the bridegroom what does it mean all these churches not down here in the roman but down into the denominational the nicolaitan baptists preach on the second coming of christ amen we preach on the second coming of christ so no difference right methodists preach the second coming of christ presbyterian preached the second coming of christ virgins nazarene preached the second coming of christ virgins pilgrim holiness preached the second coming of christ virgin that's right all of them even the message believer preached the second coming of jesus christ virgin all of us all of them went out to meet the bridegroom now you remember that that day everyone was on the road to meet the bridegroom just like ruth and oppa everybody clear now if god only respects that if you stop writing and you look at everybody then he have to take them too but for some reason the choice of god never started by the fact that they were engaged into the road to meet the bridegroom being engaged into the message doesn't get you somewhere because we were many engaged into the message today some that we started with are no longer in the message are you there praise the name of the lord brother branham continues in the same message he said now there was the virgin there was the virgin went on to meet him and the foolish virgin now did not have oil in their lamp but they had everything else are you there so by the scripture and by brother branham line up together brother branham didn't give you the scripture but you look at the scripture line up everybody clear so the difference between this virgin and that virgin is only the oil but everything else they got it everybody clear they were clean they believe in christ that's why when you say let's preach christ let's believe in christ it's not enough anybody care they believe christ they preach the word that they believe everybody clear the portion of christ they have their denomination would let them preach they preach that the second coming the sacrifice the atonement they believe you ever tied up with a good baptist scholar one time everybody there you better know what you're talking about in other words there are people outside of the message that know how to handle the bible so you as a message believer you should be able to handle the bible more than them are you there so you're gonna find that jehovah witness you need to know your bible pretty good before they make your head spin and you come back and ask the pastor everybody here but you see so close say matthew 24 matthew 24 24 read it right away and you shall see jesus said that in this last day the two spirits you see now will be so close till it will deceive the very elected if it was possible it shall be so close it shall swing them pentecostal like nobody's business sure everybody clear no problem but branham continues he said now watch the there is one church that is called the bride clear and there is another one that is called the nominal church which is the foolish virgin everybody clear now watch these two churches if there was some way i could just make the people see it just burns in my soul these churches are just as clean and holy as this one virgin if they are all virgins they are all virgins just as clean the only difference was the oil in the lamp the holy ghost and the holy ghost if it's not there if it's in there it the very same kind of fire he did on pentecost because it's the same spirit jesus christ the same yesterday today and forever amen but they don't have no fire you go to a baptist church quiet are you there and some of the message churches also quiet like baptists no fire no oil in their lamp they have church ritual going to church as a custom church just as ritual farm ceremony nothing against it creed that would check your conscience so you find that joel austin he can talk to you in a philosophical way until it makes sense are you there and songs like angel singing amen they make miracles wonderful songs amen but they are not deprived amen songs like angels you put your finger on their life you could not do it but still that is wrong it's part of it but not all of it that is the gun that misses the rapture amen the singing the anointing comes they think they want to go to the ratchet that's the khan that misses the rapture brother branham what's going on now while she was gone to get some oil that is what they are trying to do right now these great evangelical churches trying to find these great things you know go back to the let's go back to the bible let's go back to the bible let's go back to the bible because they figured out as a long time it seems like we are missing something are you there we need the pentecostal blessing why you missing something why you can imagine what kind of service they are going to have they are going to get down there and spoil all damn manukau on them we okay now amen they can preach the second coming they can preach the atonement they can preach the sacrifice but they will never touch up and tell women stop wearing pants because if they do that they're gonna lose church member they cannot tell the women stop wearing tight dresses they cannot tell the women stop having long nails stop wearing makeups stop wearing lipstick if they do that they're going to warn the ministry are you there but they want to focus on the preaching but don't want to touch the very important part they don't want to deal with the world amen amen once an opportunity comes are you there you see them going back to the same wall the sister begin to wear paint their sister begin to put makeups their sister begin to cut their hair their sister begin to put lipstick what is going on are you there but they're preaching christ but that christ is putting manuka back [Music] are you there when you preach the atonement in its fullness it chop away the world hallelujah praise the name of the lord they are going to get down there and spoil all their manicure on them and all of that no they aren't going to give up their sororities and societies and things like that holding onto the world like esau following me in one hand trying to catch god with the other hand in other words they want the blessings of god they want the miracle of god they want the power of god but they don't want to let things go are you there that's why a preacher taught brother branham why are you always calling on women why are you always cheaping the world give them the great supernatural blessing and brother one of them said if they don't understand their abcs there is no way i can teach them algebra are you there they wanna get the world keep the world keep wearing paint keep wearing tight pants keep wearing and clean clothes keep doing whatever they do normally and still yet get blessed anybody there holding on to the word like eso in one hand trying to catch god with the other hand you can do that you can be a cross-tied christian you know looking at god and to the world too you got to center yourself in calvary stay right there with that that is your characteristic of the foolish virgin are we there in matthew 25 we saw that there is a broad and there is a foolish virgin everybody clear now brother what i'm saying in the message the rapture he said the first things cometh when he start descending from heaven there is uh a shout a midnight cry what is it is a message to get the people together it is gathering the people it is gathering the virgin it is gathering the people a message comes forth first now lamp what trimming time rise and trim your lamps what was what watch was that the seventh not the six the seven behold the bridegroom cometh rise and trim your lamp and they did some of them found they didn't have all have any oil in their lamp see but it's lamp trimming time it is what malachi 4 time what he promises luke 17 you know what he means 30. all does prophecy that he can be perfectly said in order for today for this day in the scripture we see it living right there so the prophecy of matthew 24 matthew 25 of the 10th version fully is accomplished in the same time everybody clear now the second person i want to touch then we jump to esther is the roman centurion let's take matthew chapter 18. you were on 25 so let's go back to chapter eight if you're there you can say amen matthew 8 verse 8 if you dare you can say amen this centurion and gentile answer and say lord i'm not worthy humility that you should come under my roof i'm a gentile i'm like roof right now ready that you come in under my roof but speak the word which is the gentile only and my servant shall be healed for i am a man under what you see the power of the spoken word is connected with authority you remember monica you remember the adoption authority and the power of the spoken word for i am a man under authority having soldier under me and i said to this one go and he goes and to another come and he cometh and to my servant duties and he does it when jesus heard it he marveled and said to them that followed him verily i say to you i have not found so great faith no not in israel in other words that great faith of the power of the spoken word and the authority is given to the gentile everybody clear but it is not given to the gentile the foolish virgin we okay because power with our character is satanic everybody clear verse 11 and i say to you that many shall come from the east and west and shall sit with who abraham and isaac and jacob in the kingdom of what but the children of the the jews everybody clear many shall come from east from west they shall sit with what abraham the gentile will be invited into the commonwealth of israel but the jews themselves will be cast out you understand now but the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into other god darkness there shall be what whipping and gnashing of teeth whipping and washing of thief spoke about the tribulation period so there will be jews that will go under the tribulation period and the jews that goes under the tribulation period are the 140 000. so by matthew 8 by matthew 25 we understand that the gentile brad is made of virgins that have oil and by matthew chapter 8 we understand that that brad will have the power of the spoken word and the authority of god and that blood is going to be gentile everybody clear so right here we have the bride and the foolish virgin right here we have the bride the gentile with the authority and the jews the 144 thousand going through the tribulation period everybody clear brother branham can you put these two together for me brother brahm was asked a question the second question but the children of the kingdom shall be casting out of darkness is that about the same as casting them out of the mind of god but branham answered the question paragraph 34 no it would not be the same you are referring here to the wedding supper and the children of the kingdom as we ask here the children of the kingdom are what the jews and they were cuts into other darkness on the job there they were cast into other darkness because it will give you an eye gentle experience to repent but they will never cast out of the mind of god he shall never forget israel that's your roman chapter 11. see it's the kingdom the promise in other words god dealing with the nation when he dealt with israel which is the children of the kingdom brother branham you remember he said here and abraham and isaac and jacob in one place would come and set in the kingdom and what the end time see abraham isaac and jacob will be in the kingdom they were they were the kingdoms blessing people when the bridegroom cometh five watch how brother branham is blaming those scriptures matthew 8 and matthew 25. everybody clear when the bridegroom comes five of the virgins went out to meet the lord and they didn't have any or they didn't take any oil in their lamp and the other five took oil in their lamp now if you notice it's a beautiful picture buff off there and uh as they did what ever clear the reason why the jews are going under the tribulation period because they rejected jesus christ are you there and the reason why the foolish virgin is going to the tribulation period because she rejected jesus christ not jesus christ in the first coming but jesus christ in the second coming keep in mind that there is three classes of people all the time jews gentile and the church if you get those mixed up you shall surely run in trouble when you hit them in other words when you begin to read the book of revelation keep in mind jews gentile and the church because within the church there is a true vine and the false vlan are you there the first vine is the foolish virgin and the true vine is the bread everybody clear all right brother branham now when we talk about the priesthood of judah we found out in ezekiel 44 verse 15 that a high priest could not enter into the holy unfoly with war everybody remember that praise the name of the lord he needs to be sheared now they don't want to wall in the holy place if you watch according to genesis a ship have to be sheared first everybody clear but before you enter the holy of holi the only garment that was permitted was the clothing of fine lemon you remember that read the scripture at home if you forgot about it and finally it was the what the righteousness of the in other words you cannot approach the lord without the scepter without the righteousness of christ are you there you need to be clothed in his righteousness then we have boldness to enter into the holy of holies and then we can bring our petition but your woe must be sheared off then you are clothed with the righteousness of god and then you can enter the holy of holy everybody clear praise the name of the lord now we have here the foolish virgin and the hundred and forty four thousand both of those goes to the tribulation period brother branham the gentile blood is in heaven and the sleeping virgin the gentile virgin is not to be saved during that time she's already been saved but she has rejected she has been rejected in the she's the foolish virgin she was called to be the bride without oil she was rejected everybody clear no problem and now she only goes through the tribulation period of time of what purification because she rejected crust the word for her purification then she has to suffer for her deeds but the bride who has become the word a complete atonement was made of crust because he is the word brother branham here will the foolish virgin be saved no we are talking about in the tribulation period whatever happened is now in other words they are safe now but they're going to go through the tribulation period to be purged everybody clear after that time now she will have to go through the tribulation period and the reason of it is is because she has rejected the atonement in its what she has rejected the message of the hour are you there she is a believer a professed believer but she will have to go through the tribulation period the bible says and the rest of them the dragon spurt that water out of his mouth to make what woe to the remnant of the woman everybody clear so the foolish virgin here are going in the tribulation period because there is a second crucifixion of jesus christ your second staff the jews are going to the tribulation period because there was a rejection of jesus christ your first staff we clear now where are you taking me brother stephen take esther now now that you got the base let's go to west our lovely esther chapter eight all right on esther chapter 8 we found out that when esther came the second time and was crying the king of hazares stretched the scepter the second time everybody knows what it means now right then she opened up on first five of the four keys of the third pool the sovereignty of god the line of duty the motive and objective and faith to say the right thing on last sunday we spoke about the sovereignty of god and we're gonna move from there and start blending into the line of duty right let's go to esther chapter two i'm saving time you know the scripture if you dare you can say amen esther chapter two you there on chapter 1 take verse 19. and if it pleases the king let there go a what it is a commandment of the king are you there go into all the world it's the king speaking are you there and preach the gospel right a royal commandment from him and let it be written it's in the full gospel among the laws of the persian and the medies that it be not altered we cannot change this you cannot take mark 16 off it's ready that vaster come no more before the king before king a hercules and let the king give her royal estate her position it's a bad position her position to another that is what so the next queen that is coming up must be higher than the first one you follow me she must be higher than the queen higher than the conkey man higher than the virgins you follow me now everybody clear now let's go to chapter two verse two then say king the king servant that minister to him let there be fair what you see there you see there everybody clear fair young virgin sought for the king the virgin were not seeking the king you follow me he was the king seeking after the virgin it is not you looking for god it is god looking for you are we clear all right sought for the king and let who the king appoint what those officers cannot go by themself they must be appointed by the king that's why ephesians one one colossian one one paul an apostle by the will of god not man are you there those preachers that god must be appointed by god to seek for young virgins to gather the virgin matthew 25 to gather the virgin but as they are gathering the virgin not all the virgins are depriving because there is only one that is higher than our divergence we okay now verse three and let the king appoint officer many alcohol feel chosen in all the provinces of his kingdom or the earth that they may gather together you see the message gathering gather remember gather together all the fair young virgin to shoeshine the palace to the house of what the house of the women a woman in the bible represent the church bring them all to the church to the church of the living god but remember in the church there is two vine first vine and truvine garden the virgin but remember among the 10 virgins they are wise and foolish we're clear to the custody of who to the responsibility of so when you are gathered when they call you when they search for you when they pick you up and bring you into the church you first go under the custody of haiti brother stephen let's establish something here brother robert is my speed okay when you go into the house when you are called when you are picked up from the world are you there with a virgin heart are you there when you are picked up from the world when you are coming in you first go to the custody of hagee we okay go to where we are drop in verse 14 and we're going to come back you there in what if somebody's sleeping in the evening she went and on the morrow she returned into the so there were two houses the first house was under the custody of who okay but if you enter into the king and you come out and you don't qualify the sovereignty of god we go into the line of duty you must find faithful you must find favor with the king if you don't find favor with the king the line of duty right if you don't qualify on the next morning not the evening because in the evening time there shall be light are you there but after the evening on the morrow you go into the second house into the second house of the women to the custody of who so there are two custodies here you okay now when you enter when all virgins are gathered they are all gathered under heaven when you go through the king and you miss your opportunity to be picked up as a bride you move from the house of hege into the house of chess guys with the message of the hour the bible is a new book chess guys the custody of chess guys the king what chamberlain which kept there are we okay are we okay when you come to the custody of heggie you a virgin are you there then you go to the king's house to be selected are you there if you miss the king if you miss to be picked up by the king you move to the custody of shaskas when you enter in chess guys you are no longer a virgin now you become a concubine the position is to be queen there are many concubines okay there are many virgins but who is the woman that's going to be above all of them to reach that position find favor with the king are we okay you awake i told you 35 miles per hour hallelujah brother branham we believe in justification by faith romans 5 we believe that after a person being justified by faith he has peace with the lord jesus christ but it's possible that this same person could have habits such as drinking smoking doing things that he should not do filthy habits of the flesh i'm gonna say this with respect brother branham always taught three steps of grace justification sanctification baptism of the holy ghost because this thing these three steps were taught wrong express wrong that's why we have problem in the message are you there someone preached on this church that when you receive the message you receive all three he was preachy we didn't have a pastor i could not correct it but now that i'm a pastor we gotta correct that one are you there you got to go through justification sanctification baptism of the holy ghost because when we were five a year ago we were with people that we thought believed the message we gave them justification we gave them sanctification we gave them the holy ghost we even look at some of them as being more spiritual than us you look at the sister you say that sister i wish i can be like that sister i wish i can be like that brother you didn't know what was in the sister until the trial comes when the trial comes the sister that you use unless you as an example now is wearing makeup now he's wearing short dress now he's cutting her hair and you are still in the message question who have the holy ghost who was justified you owned them you touch they have the holy ghost but you come to find out you are still in the message it is not you doing that it is god in your life are you there you want the holy ghost to be like sister soy so today that sister left the message you want your holy ghost to do that you see now you are killing yourself for nothing using your harmony all the time on yourself why i can't do this why yes you cannot do that you just need to put your car on your chair are you there filthy habits of the flesh then we believe that the blood of jesus christ sanctifies this person for the service of the lord that is we believe it's sanctification second according to hebrew 13 12 where jesus also that he must sanctify the people with his own blood suffer without the great and we believe that sanctification is taught in the new testament and meant for the believer through the new testament age which we are so it is still valid we also believe that after the person has been sanctified the unclean habit has gone from the person he is a believer on the lord jesus christ and his habits are gone we believe that then he is a candidate for what which comes as a feeling of death so you must know where you are whether you are right here whether you are sanctified or whether you have the holy ghost we gave everybody the holy ghost he is in the message he got the holy ghost it's just as many time as i have told him like picking up er out in a chicken yard picking up a virgin we okay now we're back in our sermon justification is what picking up ready to use it so when they called the virgin and they pulled them to the palace they were justified by calling by being picked up you follow me praise the name of the lord that with a purpose in the heart that's what god does to the sinner he's still faithful then he is cleansed by the blood of what let's go to esther 2 chapter 3. are you there and let the king appoint officer in all provinces of his kingdom that they may gather together all the fair young virgin to shushan the palace to the house of the women to the custody of hege the king's chamberlain keeper of the women hege keeps the women the virgins are you there but shaskars the one that lost to be picked up and let their things for what b so the things for purification are given by hegemony everybody care when you are picked up you are justified you enter unto the custody of hagee you're following me then hege will provide you with the stuff for sanctification you follow me oh my god we believe okay then he is cleansed by the blood of jesus christ and the word sanctify is a compound word which means clean and set aside for what they are cleaning the virgin for they were cleaning them for service they needed to be at a position but if you miss that position you are conquerable roof serving are you there we believe that the holy spirit is putting the same vessel in service that the holy spirit is not another step of grace but more of the same grace that fills the believer to the extent where that science and wonder such as apostolic gifts spoken in first corinthians 12 manifest themselves through this believer when the holy spirit comes in to take up the gift you are justified by the holy spirit and that same holy spirit sanctifies you and that same holy spirit fill you to activate the gift that god blessed in your life by predestination for the service of the king are we clear brother branham notice how god makes a plan to us when i see this and see that since ah boy this is in 1964 after the opening of the seals because he was so he was told here that when the seal opened you received the message you receive victory brother branham after the sales if you need more coach you see me since that see that since a boy first time ever crossed there with me i have still always taught those three stages of what notice if it's not true brother branham never change it so if someone say that once you get in the message you are justified sanctify fear with the holy spirit that's not right because he was spoken that after this year this is after the seal 65. when i first started preaching many years ago we was living right up here on the road right just above here i was preaching right here at this church and she dreamed a dream that i was standing here by the side of what tristan somebody a sister saw a dream brother brandon was standing and they were three steps by brother brown everybody clear and i was standing there preaching to everybody that they must walk up these three steps before they hit there and on the highway is a little pearly like white line run into the doors of heaven to the pearly gate and that pearl has been stretched out to the top of this step in other words one two three step down the highway all the way to heaven brother branham was preaching and telling people you must go through this three step to get on the highway to heaven this is in 65 he never changes you need to be justified sanctified fill with the holy spirit they might happen in stages or they can all happen at the same time if your heart is right are you there okay my message exactly today what are the three steps justification sanctification and i was saying that a person has to come by these three steps to be able to work on that so you need to be justified sanctify then fill with the holy spirit so when you are picked up as a virgin you are picked up by justification then when you enter under the custody of hege hege gives you the step for purification your sanctification but you are not fair yet are you there who is heggy you there the word hege have four meanings hegem means meditation that's the meditation of my mind are you there hegem means the word hege means groaning and hager means separation so when the virgin are picked up are you there foolish virgin wise virgin all of them goes under the custody of haiti hey gay the holy spirit will work to see you separated from the world are you there are you there he will work in your life to produce groaning so that you can grow into something he will provide you with the word of god and he will be the theme of your meditation preparing you to go into the king chamber you okay if you miss the king chamber you're going to chess gaza let's jump to verse 8. then we're going to read this and it come to pass everybody there we won't be too long when the king's commandment and decree was heard and when many maidens were guarded together to shush on the palace to the custody of who hege that esther was brought also justification to the king's house to the custody of hege keeper of the women he's the one overseeing the church the churches the holy spirit he's there overseeing the churches that's the one that is watching over the women are you there and the men and please him there was something about esther that when he saw esther esther automatically please him the line of duty are you there the sovereignty to the line of duty and she obtained what kindness of him and he speedily gave her the things for her purification for your sanctification the material with such things as belong to her and what when esther was picked all the virgins were picked remember there is a lot of virgin but only one will be the queen there is five ten virgin only five will be the blood are you there when the virgins comes all of them were good pure fine fair lady beautiful are you there but one esther came in something about peggy and esther click are you there angela was pleased about esther he gave esther her stop for the purification and he gave also esther seven women to work with her i'm reading the bible are you there so when you see esther the purification of esther have to go through seven women okay you okay the purification of esther must go through seven churches okay the bride goes through ephesus smyrna titania seventh church all those seven steps seven women are part of the the seven church ages which are addressed by john are you mano are all gentle churches thus the whole of the church ages is god dealing with the gender and calling out their gentle blood to himself that makes the changes and the fullness of the gentile the one and the same thing but one of them the seven church changes are set forth in revelation chapter two and three taking the whole spin of the fullness of the gentile or the whole time in which god is dealing with the gentile unto salvation so when esther gather unto heggie the holy spirit open up seven women seven church ages that esther have to go through for her purification esther was giving seven women she had to go through seven church agents for her purification you okay let's go for her purification verse nine with such things as belonged to her and seven maidens seven church ages which were meant to be given to her she must go through those seven church engines out of the king's house it was the church established by the king before smyrna seven of them established by the king everybody there and he preferred her and her men stood what is somebody sleeping to the best place of the house off there so not every church is the same are you there the virgins were in the church but within that church there was the best place that was given for esther we are not the same are we there you there drop down to verse 12. now when every man every meds turn was come to go to king of hazaris are you there after she has been 12 months according to the money of women for so were the days of what her purification accomplished watch that purification that is what six months with what everybody remember what man means no means what death are you there six months with death and six months with what three daughters and we fight the things for the purifying of the so when you enter into the custody of hager you are first justified you go through the process of hager heather give you the stuff for your purification your sanctification among those staff your first steps you must die to yourself you must go to the oil of the man are you there then once you are dead you must receive sweet order now to perfume you six more months i'm reading the bible now what does the smell do a smell women put perfume on themselves for a pleasant and men put after shaving stuff on sometime like that that all the foul orders will be taken away from you when you walk into the presence of someone with body odors or with something another perfume is to take that order away so that you in the presence of the person that you might not be found it's unbearable that is what perfume or soap has ordered in it sweet orders we okay but notice amen i just feel good he was the rose of sheriff he was offered to god as a what are we okay you must be dead identified with the death of jesus christ you go through the hole of man self dying through head are you there then when you pass through that hege take the rules of sharon and broke it and bring you the perfume of sharon then when we become unbearable before god so excuse the expression so stinky our sins and things are so bad and so far then we come too a lily or any flower before perfume can be made you take a flower it's a beautiful it's a big morning lily or a rose then the rose of sharon is the beautiful flower while it's living it's beautiful but to get order out of that to get perfume he has to be crushed that's why jesus have to die and they crush it and squeeze the perfume out of it everybody clear and he had to be anointed with a certain oil perfume a certain perfume made out of the rose of sharon and jesus was the rose of sherrod jesus in his life was the most beautiful life ever lived but he could not remain that way because he had to anoint his church again to approach what because the priests entering into the holy of holy wool must be taken off but you must also put the rules off i'm going slowly because they're trying to put you through the king through the inner court okay else so his life won't squeeze out and the same holy ghost was upon him is put upon the church and he makes him the same yesterday today and forever the rules of sharon the perfume thereof the person that is approaching into their to be anointed with the same so as you stop here from heading after your justification hedges put you to a process of six months through the oil of men where you must die and after marriage given to you then the rules of sheryl the sweet perfume have to be put on you before you go into the king if you miss the king you go to chase gas are we there i'm going to head to the airport let's go to verse 13. then thus came every man to the king whatsoever she can you read with me whatsoever she was giving to her with her out of the house of the women to the king house in other words when it comes turn for you to go to the king you have the right to put on whatever you want to take are you there if you say i'm going to put lipstick they give it to you if you say i'm gonna give makeup they give it to you if you say i need a long dress they give it to you everything you wanna take you take and you go meet the king what does he mean when you were picked up under justification you go through sanctification by the oil of the man and then the perfume of the rose of sharon are you there to clean you up completely then you go through a test of your self-will i wish it was sunday so everybody could get this in this church god will put you into a test of yourself will to let you do whatever you want to do you must be put back like adam and eve are you there to see where you are standing you have not got no right i'm an american you are bought with a price that was the price of the precious blood of the son of god you have no legal right hallelujah the only right you have is come to the fountain filled with blood drawn from emmanuel's verb when sinners plunge beneath the flood lose all their ghisty stem yes sir that's the only right you have is there a surrender self will to god and then god does the leading from then on are you there when he was time for the shearing of the lamb are you following me temer sanctified himself from her widow wood are you there then she put a veil on her head she surrendered that self-will are you there after you go you are picked up through justification sanctification then god put you into a test to see whether you're gonna do your will or you're gonna surrender that me me me me god say go right your feelings want to left and you do your feelings regardless of what god said is a surrender self-will to god and then god does the leading from then on that is what causes so many strange things the holy spirit will go to a place the holy spirit hey guy say this is not right stop the meeting move you under i shall stop it two brother move right on that's right because you got to be led by the spirit and the only way to be led by the spirit is keep what not no oh lord oh my god how did it self-will why would you call that self-worth brother branham because he puts a man and a woman back again just like adam at the garden of eden free moral agency god bless the first man adam and eve right here on free moral agency he places you the same place and the only way you can get this thing fits in here is your own self-will hallelujah yourself will you have to will to do god's will are you there you have to get rid of your own self will to let god's will come in for this is the only channel that leads to the heart job to verse 15 hallelujah you there now when the turn of esther they called the first version i want this i want this i want this she went we're waiting for the news who's going to be breaking news on cnn we look at cnn the broad have not been picked up yet the second woman go everybody's wedding news news news what is the election no queens yet it was the turn of esther so all the women trembling because if you miss your shot you hear verse 15 now when the turn of esther the daughter of abigail the uncle of modica who had taken her for his daughter was come to go into the king she require what you okay they taught them whatever you want take it when they call a step they say peak as they say i don't have any will i don't have any head pick it's your right to peek you okay to find favor with god they are keys in the scripture they are keys in the message for your life to be pleasing unto god so that you can get blessings somebody's stubborn are you there brother branham say an arrogant can never expect to receive something from god heger she require is somebody sleeping she requires nothing but what so when the cow ester they say it is your turn to go into the king go ahead and picked up esther stop and say hey what do you want me to think [Music] holy spirit what do you want me to take because hager was the king's chamberlain that was keeping the woman hanging knew the secret of the king are you there hanging knows what the king's likes then when henry bring you out and he say get here take all you want really hang it oh my god oh heck he's just watching he said don't worry no news tonight when you get there you go there what about hey you know know what happened right when they call us there when they say god right there he just said pick up the test of the self-will are you there esther surrender her self-will she surrender her intelligence she surrender her heart she was surrendered her feelings she surrendered her preferences she said hey i've been long enough through this i don't have any mind anymore i have been in this house six months going through mary i have been in this house six months going through all kind of perfume i don't even know what to pick you tell me what to pick again and hey guys say this see no one day i like this woman the first time and hey guys say esther pick this one aesthetic pick that one this no no no no no no no no no don't pick this you see where follow me i am the king chamberlain i am the king chamberlain are you there let's go back verse 15. now when the turn of esther the daughter of her bigger the uncle of mordecai who had taken her for his daughter was come to go into the kings she required what but what what haga the king's chamberlain they keep it off the women who do what appointed he was a gay who was appointed like esther who who's going today esther take this this this this bring her package bring us the package take only this don't touch none of this and go straight to the king are you there only what hair they are pointing unless they obtain what esther did not obtain faithful by any chance my friend there is always keys locked for christian that's what we are unveiling in this church to make your life better and your relationship better with god you must surrender that will i love this i like this but what do you say again if anger says yes you move on if you think they say no even though it hurt i'm gonna follow hege because hagen knows the secret of the king are you there he said unless they obtained fever in the sight of all of them not just the king when she entered everybody was like oh my god turn on cnn quickly put the streaming directly so those that are home can see are you there why is zester getting favored are you there and then obtain favor in the sight of all of them that looked upon him so esther was taken to the king of herzeris in his house royal in the 10th month revelation 10 which is the month of seven which is the mouth of heaven sabbath in the seventh years of israel in 10-7 are you there and the king loves esther the king love esther can you read for me above there are many queens there are many concubines there are many virgins but you are above all of them you are better than faster are you there the king loves above all the women and she obtained what and what in the sight more than you see above the women above the virgins hire all the virgins so that he let the royal crown upon her head and made her queen in the instead of who faster in other words esther was far better than faster she was the first woman of the entire kingdom why because she surrendered the self-will that's the quality of the bride not the foolish virgin because remember the beginning the foolish virgin i like his soul they want to hold on to the lord and hang on to the world are you there they don't want to let it go are you there everybody here [Music] if you miss that you go to the house of who chess guys who's the keeper of what do you know what chess gas means i'm circling the airport it's a little traffic on the airport so i need to go around are you there are you there do you know what chess guys means you ready shes cause means he that presses the fleece or the wool he that shields the sheep why is this word put in the bible like this are you there you remember my sheep so when you get through headache and you are rejecting the holy spirit you are stubborn against the holy spirit you're gonna miss your shot and you're gonna grow into the tribulation period as a foolish virgin and there hager will press your face your wool and chest gas will shield your wall for you because you enter into the king chamber with wool where it was forbidden for you to enter in the inner court with the wall you enter because of your self-will then they have to send you to shasgas in order to shear you through the tribulation period before you go back again go back to verse 14. in the evening she went and on the morrow she returned in the second house of the women to the custody of chess girls and the king the king's chamberlain which kept the concubine she came what no more except the king delighted her there is a little hope for those foolish version and that you were called by predestination that's why she's going through tribulation and the king is going to pull her up but even though they pull you up there is already a queen you're not going to be pulled back to be a queen esther is already there you are pull back not to be a queen you will never be the queen are you there you go through the sixth seal the purging of hagee are you there you say you believe you have not received the holy spirit something is wrong with your faith god circumcised the heart the meaning to the believer really comes in full surrendering when the believer firmly believes on the lord jesus christ god is under obligation to give him the holy ghost confirmation of his faith when esther entered with the faithful figure when the king looked the king put a seal put a crown that this faith i agree with it are you with me i agree with that faithful when you are safe you just hitting then the right road well believing doesn't give you it brother it's a gift but he gave him the sign of circumcision in commemoration as a memorial of his faith and today when we say that we believe we can believe in a measure but when god give us the baptism of the holy ghost he confirms our faith and sealers he confirmed that you fully surrender to haggai are you there the holy ghost is a confirmation of your faith in god god has confirmed and recognize it so and put a seal of approval on you are you there because you follow hey god you believe god that you say you believe god i have not received the holy spirit there is something wrong with your faith because god is on the obligation to give every believer that repent is baptized is under obligation to give you the baptism of the holy spirit and he's more willing to give it to you than you are to receive it that's right so there is something wrong somewhere you just got a mental fit instead of a hard faith but esther received the crown why did she receive the crime so she didn't want none of the adorning of the world she wanted to go in to the king just like she was she adorned herself themselves like the pentecostal woman or two with a meek humble spirit and when all these fancy first ladies come by we fought their new fantago things and king looked at them and put them put them in the chamber with the concubine but when these tester come in his side and she got a glimpse of that sweet humble make spirit he said that's her go get the crown and put it on her head that's it let them adorn themselves the foolish virgin with that kind of silver spirit actually not only women but men because we are the brother adorning themselves with that kind of spirit then you are becoming ready for the bread sweet reverend esther made hair malachi 4 to take the heart esther clean herself she cleaned her heart that is what she claimed that is what the church needs a heart cleaning how do you clean your heart brother branham washed by the water of the world through the blood of jesus christ esther purge her heart before god woke up with a meek and humble spirit the church that is going to be the bride of christ now remember esther refused the worldly adornment she took the spirit in her heart to go before the king are you there the church is a whole lot like it was in the days of esther esther didn't take the perfuming of the women she adorned herself with a modest apparel the hidden man of the heart and king said put the crown on her esther was the top of the church today those who are ready to come out and adorn themselves with the sweetness of the holy spirit are you there not perfuming and dressing off the world try to compare with them but that hidden men of the heart when esther was to be chosen to stand before the king she didn't adorn herself with all these things but she adorned herself with a sweet mixed period that is what the bread is adorning herself with all the fruit of the spirit following her everybody clear everybody clear everybody clear so next time on part 10 we're going to get now into the line of duty you need to be chosen in a light of duty what make that esther choice to be appointed into the position the adoption of esther how did he come back how did he come by why was esther appointed to be the queen she was appointed because of the last test of self-will she was ready to surrender that self-will completely and when you surrender that self-will when you remove yourself you accepted not your will but the king's will then you and the hagee and god will confirm that abraham believed god and he was imputed unto him for righteousness then god give the seal of circumcision to confirm the faith of abraham that i agree and i accepted that faith let's stand up praise the name of the lord as the musician comes this was a preparation to the line of duty because in the line of duty you must find favor with the king and to find favor with the king you must be chosen to be chosen you got to go through head you got to go through the purging of the holy spirit you got to die to yourself die to your american to your african to your european to your whichever country you come to die to whatever you come to and surrender to the message to the word and let the word lead you and when the word is leading you then the word will tell you the holy spirit will direct you and you're gonna do the things that pleases the king because hege knows what the king's like if you surrender he's gonna tell you what the king's like and when you get the secret of the king it's very easy to get favor with the kings then when you get favor with your king and when you are appointed and you are in the queen's position you are in your position then you are in the line of duty and when you got in the line of duty there is a secret to that one we will talk about it in the line of duty heavenly father lord we thank you again for your grace for your love for your mercy and for everything you do it for us father it has been in years that we walk in this message and many keys has been missed and we have questioned ourselves some got frustrated with the message and they left because they were disappointed they could see certain things happening in a nominal church and asking themselves why it doesn't happen around among the message rank some lord father has been struggling for a long time and they don't know why in certain people's life moving way better and their life still having struggled but lord you have given us a grace in this hour to open these keys to us the key of meditation the key to breaking to the sovereignty of god and tonight you have um fell unto us a major key because the edge of laodicea your prophet told us that laodicea means the people's right and father it's a very deadly fixed law because the right of the people is what bring our self will again to to to be resurrected where we want things to go our own ways we want stuff to be going on always we want the church to be drifted by our own will we want our families to be driven by our own will we want our decision to be driven a certain way and further by doing that we become more and more stranger to the inner coat lord father but you brought us the message you brought us to a different ministry lord where you are sharing the will completely and tonight you unveil unto us a major key telling us that we must surrender our will we must surrender our eye that's why your prophet even made a statement that the greatest enemy that he has is william marion prana because he is the one that get in the way of the lord and brother branham said that if i can overcome that enemy if i can overcome william marion branham if i can overcome myself then i can overcome every enemy how can you overcome yourself and be able to overcome every enemy because overcoming yourself will give the leadership of god to appoint you to your position and when you are in your position then you are in the line of duty then when you are in the line of duty then there is no enemy that can stand before you that you're not going to be able to knock out father these are major keys lord that has been missed in the church for a long time we have been doing things in our own way we have been using our head so much in spite of what solomon said that lead not unto their own understanding father may you help this church may you help the families of this church may you help those that are watching online to realize that their life is not their lives they need to surrender they need to stop foolishness they need to stop everything they're doing they need to recalibrate their life and measure their life with the revealed word of the hour and make sure whatever they're doing is pleasing unto the king because that which is pleasing unto the king open up the favor of the king in our life we have so many excuses we can say this happen we can say this is going on we can say this is this this this this and the devil got into all kind of excuses until we don't even concern about the things of god but father may you shake every family may you check every church may you check every juror may we check our motive may we check our objective may we check our heart may we check what are we doing may we check what is holding me at home that i don't want to be in church may we check what is making me not to read the bible what is making me not to listen to the message what is making me not doing things that are pleasing unto the king because then we can see where our shortcoming is and further then we can recalibrate our life by the power of the holy spirit it is impossible for you to speak the way you spoke tonight without you giving us power to overcome father made the people realize that unfolding these kids is telling them that there is an available anointing an available power that can help them move from the mediocrity the situation they are and move into a better situation for the pleasure of the king father we thank you for everything and we are committing this church unto the heaven lord may you take the oncoming service may you protect your children throughout the week may you remove every hindrance and every attack of the devil and may you continue to bless her as we humbly ask it father in the name of jesus christ in the name of jesus christ father lord if there is someone struggling someone who is sick someone who has trouble who need a solution or an answer lord may you minister unto them father lord we committed all and we are putting everything on the mutual law even this church is not directed by men i told my wife i'm a mutual father you the holy spirit because you again you know what this church what the women need lord father for their purging their purification you know what they need to be pleasing unto the king and you are providing these keys lord father as each one of us tonight lord everyone is praying for their own family for their own situation father may you minister to them and give them the desire of their heart lord we must say that the service is a little bit longer but how many times do we spend praying father we are in in every other kind of stuff but we don't even have time to pray lord we are praying together you spoke to us lord that when two or three are gathered together asking for something lord you will give it unto us father may you granted because we're coming and asking in the name of jesus christ father we only ask it and surrender everything lord in the name of jesus christ in the name of jesus christ in the name of jesus christ in the name of jesus christ hallelujah you can come in my brother god bless you church we love you [Music] amen you know i thought i thought i've read the book of esther before but um i don't know uh i need to go back and read it again i tell you what that's what reading the bible uh without a revelation you know and that's why brother brandt said one of the greatest things you can pray for is a great revelation and tonight i received a greater revelation around the book of esther more than i've ever in my life and i know it's not just by the work of stephen shango but i know it's about the work of the holy spirit working through our pastor working through this church and i'll tell you what it's a tremendous blessing hearing about how esther found favor by putting her car in neutral by surrendering her own self-will by the character of esther and that's why brother and brother bram says one of the only things we'll take with us is our character and that's why i pray lord give me the right character give me the character to surrender my own self-will to whatever you have for me whatever your plan is um brother branham also said i rather i rather you be right in your spirit and wrong in your doctrine because if you're able to put your car in neutral god can correct a doctrine but if you're if your spirit isn't right and that takes more work for god to correct so i pray we just have the right spirit i pray i have the right spirit and then god if there's an error in my doctrine god can bring that out but i'm just that was amazing that was outstanding uh i was i'll tell you was it was i have to go back and listen to it again because i feel like i might have missed some stuff and i'm just [Music] [Music] above all and treasures of the earth [Music] foreign [Music] rejected [Music] trembled on the ground [Music] y'all are dismissed as we do this again and all created things [Music] above all [Music] who above all kingdoms above all [Music] and and treasures of the earth [Music] foreign [Music] rejected [Music] tripled on the garage [Music] one more time is your dismiss this evening [Music] lord you live [Music] traveled on [Music] [Applause] [Music] cheers [Music] rules
