[50:32] for me to be preaching here and uh the

[50:52] always a joy to come back here
[50:55] amen amen
[50:59] let's open to Psalms
[51:02] chapter chapter 105 verse
[51:10] 13 if you're feeling down go to the
[51:13] Psalms anytime you are feeling low just
[51:16] of course you can read any Scripture but
[51:19] go straight to the Psalms the Psalms are
[51:22] such a blessing I think in the
[51:24] Tabernacle they would read a Psalm every
[51:26] day
[51:27] you know because the Bible says worship
[51:29] God in Psalms hyms and spiritual
[51:35] songs 105 verse 13 the Bible
[51:40] reads when they went from one nation to
[51:43] another from one Kingdom to to another
[51:46] people he suffered no men to do them
[51:49] wrong amen yeah he reproved Kings for
[51:52] their sakes saying touch not my
[51:56] anointing
[51:57] and do my prophets no harm you may have
[52:02] your seats may God bless the reading of
[52:04] his
[52:05] word
[52:07] hallelujah so today I was a doctor on
[52:10] Cor so when the main doctor came I said
[52:13] I don't have to be on
[52:15] duty say I didn't he said I didn't bring
[52:17] my tools said maybe we should take your
[52:22] license anyway we will give him Grace
[52:29] hallelujah amen so for a little title we
[52:33] want to talk about uh healing in the
[52:35] atonement amen and for a subtopic we
[52:38] want to talk about the children's bread
[52:41] yes sir it's going to be a very simple
[52:42] message uh this morning so we hope that
[52:45] you stay
[52:46] awake uh uh just felt led God you know
[52:50] placed this upon my heart just to speak
[52:52] about this subject am there are many
[52:54] things that are in the Bible but you
[52:56] always want to go where the Lord leads
[52:58] you there is no big subject small
[53:02] subject you have to go where God is
[53:05] leading you to go amen because if we
[53:07] preach what we want then we are no
[53:09] longer Servants of God that's exactly
[53:11] right then we become Servants of
[53:13] ourselves that's exactly right you could
[53:15] be studying something and getting
[53:17] excited uhh but the Lord will tell you
[53:19] you Minister on this and you just have
[53:22] to obey the leading of the spirit yes
[53:26] sir many things that can be spoken about
[53:29] sometimes we we preach you know deep
[53:30] things and I enjoy those things but
[53:32] sometimes may God may say you go and
[53:34] preach on this sometimes God can say go
[53:36] and preach about baptism yes sir you
[53:39] know because God he knows there's a lamp
[53:42] somewhere that needs to hear that word
[53:45] yes my brother you have to obey the
[53:47] voice of the Lord yes my brother
[53:49] sometimes God can leave 99 that's right
[53:51] just to go for one that's right he can
[53:53] just have a service for one person
[53:56] that's EX exactly the prophet went to a
[53:58] place called mtown because there was a
[54:00] lamp that was
[54:02] bleeding Hallelujah like the call that
[54:05] Paul received to come to Macedonia yes
[54:08] sir he went there because of an
[54:10] Macedonian call that's exactly and we
[54:12] believe tonight that we want the Holy
[54:13] Spirit to lead us wherever we go that's
[54:16] exactly we don't we don't ever want to
[54:18] become too big no sir to where God
[54:21] cannot lead us no sir we always want to
[54:23] be sensitive to the leadership of the
[54:27] Spirit Hallelujah so here in the Book of
[54:30] Psalms yes sir the Bible says that they
[54:33] went from one nation that's right to
[54:35] another that's right in other words they
[54:37] were pilgrims and every Christian is a
[54:40] pilgrim yes my brother they went from
[54:42] one Kingdom to another kingdom uhhuh and
[54:45] the Bible says he suffered no man to do
[54:47] them wrong yes my brother he reproved
[54:50] Kings for their sake that's right God
[54:54] reproved Kings for their sake sake
[54:56] that's right he did not just to reprove
[54:59] any Ordinary People he reproved Kings
[55:02] for the sake of his children yes my
[55:05] brother and I want to tell you to this
[55:06] morning that he is still the same that's
[55:09] ex he's still able to rebuke a a
[55:12] governor for your sake he's able to
[55:14] rebuke a king for your sake amen when
[55:17] you are on God's side God will be able
[55:20] to take care of you amen amen hallelujah
[55:24] yes sir and he said touch not
[55:26] my anointed that's right and do my
[55:29] prophets no harm amen so he's anointed
[55:33] are his church that's right so much so
[55:38] that God says in the Bible in the Book
[55:40] of Revelations hurt not the oil and the
[55:43] wine amen amen he says do do everything
[55:47] that you want to do that's right but
[55:49] touch not the oil and the wine if you
[55:52] have Revelation if you have the holy
[55:55] spirit amen then you have God's
[55:57] protection amen amen amen you become one

[56:21] spirit that brings cover that's right
[56:24] Hallelujah yes sir that's the only
[56:25] connection that you need that's the only
[56:28] link that you need is the power of the
[56:30] holy spirit amen amen one time someone

[1:01:12] uncover the enemy yes sir but sometimes
[1:01:15] people get an idea that there's a
[1:01:17] special man that will come from
[1:01:19] somewhere and they'll pray for me and
[1:01:22] everything things are going to be okay
[1:01:23] for me you don't need that my brother
[1:01:26] all you need is to believe the word all

[1:07:52] Rock even our enemies themselves they
[1:07:55] are the judges it's not for you to tell
[1:07:58] people you know what I'm a Christian no
[1:08:00] this is me this the enemies themselves
[1:08:02] they are the judges my brother your
[1:08:04] neighbors are the judges your coakers
[1:08:06] are the judges they should say this
[1:08:09] brother is a Christian this sister is a
[1:08:11] Christian there's something different
[1:08:13] about this
[1:08:16] person it was not Daniel who was crying
[1:08:19] out in the Lion's Den and saying
[1:08:22] neaz please take me out it was the king
[1:08:26] who ran that's it says Daniel are you
[1:08:28] still alive that's it I knew your God
[1:08:30] was going to come down and save you amen
[1:08:33] the enemies are the churches of what God
[1:08:36] can
[1:08:37] do
[1:08:39] Hallelujah now praise be to God so now
[1:08:43] healing is part of the atonement amen we
[1:08:46] get into that because that's my my
[1:08:48] subject this morning healing is part of
[1:08:51] the atonement amen now we cannot preach
[1:08:54] salvation with without preaching healing
[1:08:58] amen amen amen because these two are
[1:09:00] connected together yes my brother
[1:09:02] although we don't emphasize healing but
[1:09:04] there's healing in the word always when
[1:09:07] we are preaching the first seal there's
[1:09:09] healing that's it when we preach the
[1:09:10] second seal there's healing when you PR
[1:09:13] the trumpets there's healing that's it
[1:09:15] you see now because without the correct
[1:09:17] teaching that's it some people always
[1:09:19] think well we'll wait for a day when we
[1:09:22] have a prayer meeting then I'll bring my
[1:09:24] request that's the problem no that's the
[1:09:26] big problem whenever the message is
[1:09:28] being preached amen there healing
[1:09:32] amen because healing is part of the
[1:09:34] atonement always you cannot preclude
[1:09:38] healing from the atonement it's
[1:09:39] impossible no sir am hallelujah
[1:09:44] amen amen amen the prophet says in
[1:09:47] contending for the faith sickness is an
[1:09:49] attribute of sin that's exactly now
[1:09:51] maybe you haven't sinned yourself
[1:09:53] personally uhhuh is is what causes you
[1:09:56] to be sick but it was because of sin in
[1:09:58] the first place right that brought
[1:10:00] sickness to the world that's right
[1:10:02] before we have ever had any sin we had
[1:10:05] no sickness that's exactly that's what
[1:10:06] the prophet says and he says now yes you
[1:10:09] cannot deal with sin in any way without
[1:10:12] dealing with uh uh sickness right
[1:10:15] without dealing with it says without
[1:10:17] dealing with sickness or every attribute
[1:10:19] that sin produced that's exactly right
[1:10:22] see when we deal with sin we deal with
[1:10:24] death right we deal with sickness is the
[1:10:27] first stage of death when sickness takes
[1:10:30] your body right so the prophet is saying
[1:10:32] now take your time now salvation
[1:10:36] wonderful is
[1:10:40] part it has got many attributes one of
[1:10:42] them is healing right salvation brings
[1:10:45] you healing yes sir salvation brings you
[1:10:48] Joy yes sir salvation brings you peace
[1:10:50] yes sir salvation brings you many many
[1:10:53] things yes my brother I may not come
[1:10:55] here and preach on peace but you know
[1:10:58] what by preaching the gospel you get
[1:11:01] Peace by preaching the gospel you don't
[1:11:04] get joy because you know what all these
[1:11:06] things they are contained in Salvation
[1:11:10] that's it and salvation comes from the
[1:11:13] atonement pre my brother Hallelujah
[1:11:16] preach my brother oh my pre my brother
[1:11:19] so when God brought our atonement that's
[1:11:22] it to atone is to reconcile
[1:11:26] amen you say now that's why you have an
[1:11:29] atony who represents you someone who
[1:11:32] stands for sure that's it so Jesus
[1:11:34] Christ was our atonement amen and if you
[1:11:37] go to Isaiah 53 it talks about many
[1:11:39] things uhuh he was wounded for our
[1:11:42] transgression that's right but his
[1:11:43] stripes were healed that's right he say
[1:11:45] now the chastisement of our peace yes
[1:11:48] sir so so peace came from his
[1:11:50] chastisement that's right from his
[1:11:53] tribes to get our healing right amen all
[1:11:56] these things that we read in Isaiah 53
[1:11:58] they are attributes of the atonement
[1:12:01] that's exactly right it's not a separate
[1:12:03] Ministry no sir it's the same ministry
[1:12:06] that's exactly right take your time but
[1:12:09] you see people have taken this healing
[1:12:13] and theyve commercialized
[1:12:15] it to make money oh brother they have
[1:12:19] got some special healing power bring
[1:12:21] your seed who pray for you that is not
[1:12:23] scriptural amen if you a gospel preacher
[1:12:27] you are a healing preacher you are a joy
[1:12:30] preacher you're a peace preacher if you
[1:12:32] are a gospel preacher you are preaching
[1:12:35] the Good News of the Kingdom amen amen
[1:12:38] amen because you know what the devil
[1:12:40] will tell you oh your power is not
[1:12:42] gifted your pastor is not gifted to for
[1:12:45] your healing that's a lie that's the
[1:12:48] devil your power your pastor is enough
[1:12:50] power to pray for you just like any
[1:12:52] other minister amen amen amen amen amen
[1:12:56] because the gospel brings healing yes my
[1:12:59] brother take your time Hallelujah take
[1:13:02] your time I'm bringing healing cloth to
[1:13:05] sh it's not as far as you can
[1:13:08] think it's not somewhere far in a
[1:13:10] distance healing is right there with you
[1:13:14] right now yes my
[1:13:17] brother take your time oh my yes my
[1:13:21] brother you see that's why people run
[1:13:22] run after camps and different places
[1:13:25] I'll go to this place those things are
[1:13:28] fine but that is not
[1:13:30] faith that is not Faith because if you
[1:13:34] have faith you don't even need to go
[1:13:36] anywhere you say Lord I believe you
[1:13:39] right now I can be healed yes sir and if
[1:13:42] you believe God God acts upon your faith
[1:13:45] amen amen amen amen because you know
[1:13:48] what people they start to bind people
[1:13:51] around themselves right that's it right
[1:13:55] if you want to be healed you have to
[1:13:56] come to our church you have to come to
[1:13:58] our special
[1:14:00] meetings healing Services hallelujah oh

[1:14:20] now healing there's healing in the
[1:14:23] S that's the that this is where we spend
[1:14:26] 99% of our time take your time because
[1:14:28] if you are not healed in the soul what
[1:14:30] are you doing going to hell because if
[1:14:33] you are a son of God you can lose your
[1:14:35] mind and go to heaven that's a quot if
[1:14:38] you're a Son of God you can wear glasses
[1:14:40] like me and go to heaven so that's why
[1:14:43] we don't we don't we don't emphasize too
[1:14:45] much on the outside we focus here yes
[1:14:49] sir because that is where everything
[1:14:52] lays that's where start and the second

[1:22:47] about healing don't just get caral we
[1:22:49] are we are talking about everything amen
[1:22:52] we are talking about everything amen but
[1:22:54] the first healing has to be happened
[1:22:57] here this is what is a compulsory it's a
[1:23:01] must you are compelled you are you are
[1:23:04] completely compelled and commanded amen
[1:23:07] amen that's why the prophet says in the
[1:23:09] message what is the Holy Ghost says you
[1:23:12] are it's compulsory it's mandatory
[1:23:15] mandatory to receive the Holy Ghost amen
[1:23:18] amen because if you are not circumcised
[1:23:20] on the eighth day you are cut off from
[1:23:22] Israel exactly a commandment it's not a
[1:23:25] negotiation no it's not an option you
[1:23:29] must receive the Holy Ghost amen amen
[1:23:32] amen amen if you don't have the Holy
[1:23:35] Ghost you might have a gem of life which
[1:23:37] is another subject but you know what
[1:23:39] your soul is dark because you know what
[1:23:42] you have not it's not been quickened
[1:23:44] that's right but when that seed is
[1:23:46] quickened then you are alive amen but
[1:23:48] when you are alive here yes sir it does
[1:23:50] not mean you are free down here uhuh
[1:23:53] down here you have to fight for every
[1:23:55] inch that's exactly right you have to

[1:24:00] brother you have to fight for your
[1:24:01] healing yes you have to fight for your

[1:24:05] to fight for it
[1:24:08] amen the prophet say salvation amen will
[1:24:11] last as far as your faith will last
[1:24:13] that's exactly right and he says your
[1:24:15] healing that's exactly right will last
[1:24:17] as far as your faith will last that's
[1:24:19] exactly right that's why there are
[1:24:20] people who are healed they go for four
[1:24:22] years after four years they get get sick
[1:24:24] and they die sometimes because they've
[1:24:27] lost their faith you have to hold on to

[1:26:13] brother says Tommy osor is my convert
[1:26:17] not to salvation but to Divine Healing
[1:26:20] you can be saved and you don't believe
[1:26:22] in healing and you need a conversion so
[1:26:26] the prophet says he is my convert to
[1:26:28] Divine Healing and this morning if you
[1:26:31] don't believe in Divine Healing be my
[1:26:33] convert amen God still heals I say God
[1:26:37] still heals

[1:27:07] we are preaching the tret there's
[1:27:09] healing amen amen amen amen amen you
[1:27:14] cannot take healing from salvation it's
[1:27:16] part of the atonement that's exactly
[1:27:20] right it's not the main thing but it's
[1:27:22] there yes sir
[1:27:27] oh my glory to
[1:27:30] God lovely thank you Jesus yes my
[1:27:34] brother the prophet says Tommy Osborne
[1:27:37] one of the finest little men I ever met
[1:27:40] nearly Tommy Osborne he's a man after my
[1:27:42] own heart a convert
[1:27:46] to a convert to Divine Healing in my own
[1:27:49] meeting amen which stood there on that
[1:27:52] watched all the right thing in the
[1:27:53] Portland the Maniac Run at the
[1:27:56] platform you see the prophet is saying
[1:27:58] in the message Faith he's capturing the
[1:28:00] conversation that he had with Tommy
[1:28:02] Osborne he says do you do you think I
[1:28:05] have a gift of healing I want you to
[1:28:07] listen carefully take your time I said I
[1:28:11] forget I'll forget it brother Osborn I
[1:28:13] said there's no there there will be so
[1:28:15] much fanaticism tag to that after a
[1:28:18] while till that two evening that goes
[1:28:20] out has has to have the gift of healing
[1:28:23] I said look look you are a minister
[1:28:25] uhhuh so Tomy wasand s to brother Bram
[1:28:27] do I have the gift of healing take your
[1:28:29] time brother and the prophet says are
[1:28:31] you a minister ah and he said oh yes God
[1:28:35] called me to be a minister that's it I
[1:28:37] said that's right every every Minister
[1:28:42] every that's called is called to pray
[1:28:46] for the sick too that's it every
[1:28:49] Minister that's
[1:28:51] it Hallelujah brother brother Kell you
[1:28:55] are called to pray for the sick am
[1:28:57] brother po you are pray to call to pray
[1:28:59] for the sick if you are a minister
[1:29:02] because remember the parable of the
[1:29:04] Samaritan how many pennies was he
[1:29:07] given you are supposed to take you know
[1:29:10] the good Samar was supposed to to to to
[1:29:12] to take care of that man who was found
[1:29:13] on the Jero Road and he was given enough
[1:29:16] pennies to take care of that person and
[1:29:19] as a minister when you come in the
[1:29:21] ministry God gives you that Grace
[1:29:24] to preach salvation to bring to preach
[1:29:27] healing amen it's part of your
[1:29:29] credentials amen as a minister of the
[1:29:32] Gospel
[1:29:34] Hall amen and can I go a little further
[1:29:37] yes sir every believer is a
[1:29:40] promise every believer has a promise if
[1:29:44] you are a mother you have a right to lay
[1:29:46] hands on your child and you say Satan
[1:29:49] get of my child amen amen amen amen and
[1:29:53] send the Deacons the
[1:29:54] testimony I want to give you a testimony
[1:29:57] we prayed for our child and he is
[1:29:59] healed for your own information
[1:30:04] that's I there is Gifts of healing I
[1:30:07] understand that because a gift the says
[1:30:09] it's a measure of Grace that's what the
[1:30:11] Bible says of of course there are people
[1:30:14] who are given a greater measure just
[1:30:15] like the evangelism is a measure of
[1:30:18] Grace being a prophet is a measure of
[1:30:20] Grace being a teacher is a measure of
[1:30:23] Grace but healing is across the
[1:30:27] board Hallelujah yes sir the
[1:30:32] at amen we are trying to stabilize the
[1:30:35] church are we together amen so that
[1:30:38] people are not
[1:30:40] wondering I want to change church
[1:30:42] because you know what there's no healing
[1:30:44] in our church no there's healing in prop
[1:30:47] in the ministry amen amen numbers 21:9
[1:30:52] and Moses made a Serpent of brass and
[1:30:55] put it upon a paw and it came to pass
[1:30:57] that if a serpent had beaten any man
[1:31:00] when he beeld The Serpent of brass he
[1:31:03] lived all they wanted had to do was to
[1:31:05] look at the Bren Serpent and Christ is
[1:31:09] our Bren serpent that's right how many
[1:31:11] knows that amen now Malachi 4: 2 and 3
[1:31:16] take your time the Bible says but un you
[1:31:18] the previous verse it says that you know
[1:31:21] the the day of the Lord shall come that
[1:31:22] shall burn as an oven right right he's
[1:31:24] talking about the last day and but here
[1:31:27] in verse two and I like the scripture
[1:31:29] that says but you know God will say a
[1:31:32] lot of things but he say but it's a
[1:31:35] conjunction but unto you that fear my
[1:31:38] name shall the son of righteousness
[1:31:41] arise with what healing with what and
[1:31:46] you shall go forth and grow up as CES of
[1:31:48] the store
[1:31:51] amen oh my and you shall treay down the
[1:31:55] wicked right for there shall be ashes
[1:31:57] under the SS of your feet all the
[1:31:59] Hollywood that you see it's ashes that's
[1:32:02] exactly it's Canon
[1:32:04] F amen that I shall do this says the
[1:32:07] Lord of host amen now here the prophet
[1:32:10] now interpreting because remember a
[1:32:12] prophet is a Divine revealer of the word
[1:32:14] of God that's exactly right says to a
[1:32:17] glorious ring with Jesus for a thousand
[1:32:20] years of Shalom uhh when will it I don't
[1:32:23] know said it would be I don't know how
[1:32:26] he's going to do it but his spoken word
[1:32:28] will be a Vindicated when the son of
[1:32:30] righteousness shall rise with healing in
[1:32:33] his wings and he says and the healing
[1:32:36] part there there will not be a physical
[1:32:39] healing as you think go ahead my brother
[1:32:42] go ahead says this scripture is not a
[1:32:44] physical healing take your time it's a
[1:32:46] Rapture
[1:32:49] scripture PR my brother don't you like
[1:32:52] when the prophet changes your
[1:32:55] ah it says it's not as you think so in
[1:32:59] other words this healing let me finish
[1:33:01] the CT and we go back to go to the board
[1:33:04] says he says he says will be a physical
[1:33:06] healing as you think as saying
[1:33:09] somebody's got sickness and they'll be
[1:33:10] taken away from them that's what's going
[1:33:14] now in time that's right but the whole
[1:33:16] creature will be changed right so the
[1:33:19] sign of righteousness bringing healing
[1:33:21] the main event is the rapture amen
[1:33:24] because the Rapture is the healing of
[1:33:27] the body am it's the healing of all
[1:33:29] creation amen but the praying for the
[1:33:32] sick is a type of the of the of the
[1:33:36] actual healing amen so when we preach
[1:33:39] some of the deep things in the Bible we
[1:33:41] want you to focus on the main healing
[1:33:44] that's say that's it and it will take
[1:33:46] care because this healing is a tith amen
[1:33:50] it's a shadow amen it's a negative amen
[1:33:54] so we don't spend too much time on the
[1:33:56] negative because once you have the if
[1:33:58] you have the positive correct you
[1:34:01] automatically have the
[1:34:05] negative take your time we're correcting
[1:34:08] your thinking because you know what
[1:34:10] people can become so carried away oh
[1:34:13] brother I tell you God is moving in our
[1:34:15] church this happened this happen God is
[1:34:16] healing people every day yes P we may
[1:34:19] not be talking about it every day we may
[1:34:21] not give too much attention but God is
[1:34:23] heing people amen
[1:34:26] amen say oh brother we are preaching the
[1:34:29] trumpets again why don't you just talk
[1:34:32] about
[1:34:33] miracles there are Miracles when we are
[1:34:35] preaching the trumpets that's that's
[1:34:39] that's exactly right depending on how
[1:34:42] you looking it exactly yes sir a paradox
[1:34:46] look at the title Prophet says because
[1:34:48] healing is the children's
[1:34:52] bread amen
[1:34:54] amen and bread is daily but the Bible
[1:34:58] says give us this day our daily bread
[1:35:01] take your time so you don't go to town
[1:35:04] when you have ate bread ah you can't eat
[1:35:06] bread at home and start telling everyone
[1:35:08] H sister I'll tell you this morning I
[1:35:10] had bread uhhuh oh I had bread from
[1:35:13] Publix it was cute preacher because it's
[1:35:17] children if children's bread is
[1:35:19] something that you have to have amen if
[1:35:22] you come to brother Aron can I see you I
[1:35:24] said okay my sister tell me what is it I
[1:35:26] ate bread ah I ate bread this
[1:35:30] morning I said sister here is $10 buy
[1:35:33] two more Loaves and enjoy
[1:35:38] yourself we're not saying it's not there
[1:35:40] it's important yes sir but you cannot
[1:35:43] spend your day say friends I have to
[1:35:46] tell you I had bread Pastor I I should
[1:35:49] tell you I had bread we are not
[1:35:52] minimizing healing
[1:35:54] want you to know that it's so close to
[1:35:56] you it's just like Tong Paul says it's
[1:35:59] the least of the gifts am and the
[1:36:02] prophet says if you spend enough time in
[1:36:04] prayer you may speak in tongues that's
[1:36:06] exactly right so we cannot measure on a
[1:36:08] minor
[1:36:11] no hit
[1:36:14] the it's bread amen and today we are
[1:36:17] giving bread huh do you want whole itat
[1:36:20] receive it do you want sliced receive it
[1:36:23] we are giving bread this morning amen
[1:36:26] amen you say brother I don't have enough
[1:36:28] Faith even if you have a lunch box like
[1:36:31] a little boy bring it to Jesus that's it
[1:36:34] bring it to Jesus he will multiply that
[1:36:36] bread amen amen if you have enough Faith
[1:36:39] this morning as I'm preaching you can
[1:36:41] stand on your feet and claim your
[1:36:43] healing and you walk away healed am
[1:36:46] different from the way you
[1:36:49] came don't say I'm going to wait until
[1:36:52] the end of the service you are getting
[1:36:53] being healed right
[1:36:56] now brother Aon is going to call a
[1:36:58] prayer line no you can be healed now
[1:37:00] amen amen
[1:37:03] amen
[1:37:05] amen we have to teach these things yes
[1:37:08] my brother because you see the church
[1:37:10] was taking a sideway yes sir the prophet
[1:37:14] says we realize that it's in the
[1:37:16] atonement yes sir and the atonement
[1:37:19] first is applied to our souls that's oh
[1:37:23] my number one that's that this is the
[1:37:25] start yes sir this is the start but you
[1:37:28] see others want to start
[1:37:31] where others want to focus when way and
[1:37:34] that's a problem because you know
[1:37:37] what because the bo is not redeemed
[1:37:40] that's exact unfortunately that's right
[1:37:42] no matter how spiritual you are the body
[1:37:45] is not redeemed that's exactly right
[1:37:47] that's why we don't hug our sisters
[1:37:49] that's exactly right that is exact
[1:37:53] because we are immature no but we know
[1:37:55] that we still have red blood cells uhhuh
[1:37:59] uhhuh your cells could be green that's
[1:38:01] all right that's your problem but mine
[1:38:03] are red and they still work pray to my
[1:38:09] brother the prophet says you can't say I
[1:38:12] can hug a woman and don't feel anything
[1:38:13] something is wrong say something is
[1:38:15] wrong with you something is wrong
[1:38:17] something is if your body is correct
[1:38:19] correct you have to feel something amen
[1:38:23] amen
[1:38:24] that's what he say that's why we that's
[1:38:26] why we don't we don't be alone with a
[1:38:29] woman if I if I visit a brother I knock
[1:38:32] on the door his brother sayth around no
[1:38:36] he's not around God bless you my sister
[1:38:38] and you you move away that's it I'll
[1:38:40] come inside I'll have tea no no no no
[1:38:43] tea no tea no tea the Bible says flee
[1:38:47] from the very appearance of
[1:38:50] sinen the Bible says to walk
[1:38:53] circumspectly that's exactly right
[1:38:57] no why should you give someone a
[1:39:00] question we we had saying back home says
[1:39:03] someone SC don't drink water in a beer
[1:39:08] J so I know brother it's just water why
[1:39:11] can't you find a clean glass something
[1:39:14] that is not
[1:39:17] questionable oh brother it's a beer pot
[1:39:19] but I'm drinking water no no no no can
[1:39:22] you can't you find another container
[1:39:24] the B yes sir
[1:39:26] preach preach my brother
[1:39:29] preach walk circumspectly amen amen amen
[1:39:34] don't give other people questions
[1:39:36] standing block standing block why are
[1:39:40] you doing that standing block anyway let
[1:39:42] me take your time so the prophet says
[1:39:45] the first is the healing of the Soul
[1:39:47] right and then this the the healing
[1:39:49] comes down to these two parts of your
[1:39:51] body right amen amen and and the prophet
[1:39:53] says and healing is always forun every
[1:39:56] message amen so every Ministry has
[1:39:59] healing amen you cannot preach the
[1:40:02] gospel without preaching healing because
[1:40:04] healing is a bait Amen on the hook amen
[1:40:07] but if the fish is now out of the
[1:40:11] water why would you keep giving it
[1:40:14] worms huh
[1:40:17] preach
[1:40:18] preach the fish is in the freezer in the
[1:40:21] garage huh they need say I'm going to

[1:42:26] time on
[1:42:28] WhatsApp if he's lying down on video
[1:42:31] games the whole day preach then he is
[1:42:33] not a
[1:42:34] redeemer because a redeemer must have
[1:42:37] three attributes preach now he must be
[1:42:39] willing he must be able and he must be a
[1:42:43] near Kings man
[1:42:46] amen he has to be an eagle he has to be
[1:42:50] an eagle you cannot be Redeemed by
[1:42:52] someone who is not a
[1:42:55] Kinsman preach my brother Hallelujah
[1:42:58] glory to
[1:43:00] God oh my glory to God in one in a
[1:43:05] million the prophet says I'm winding
[1:43:07] down
[1:43:08] friends sitting on this certain Rock
[1:43:11] there right there where he had appeared
[1:43:14] I had a friend that was with us that had
[1:43:16] come down from up in Minnesota his
[1:43:18] people was was here with this morning
[1:43:20] I'm not sure but what he was here here
[1:43:23] some of on the other floors it was it
[1:43:25] was do uh Donovan Vitz a fine young
[1:43:29] fellow a Lutheran that had just give his
[1:43:32] life to Christ and been filled with the
[1:43:35] Holy Ghost because that's the main thing
[1:43:38] the prophet whenever you would pray for
[1:43:40] people he would say are you a Christian
[1:43:42] amen amen that was the first the first
[1:43:45] thing amen he didn't say do you have a
[1:43:47] seed no sir says are you a Christian
[1:43:51] that's right and you say I'm not a
[1:43:52] Christian says if God heals you do you
[1:43:55] promise you're going to you're going to
[1:43:57] you're going to you're going to follow
[1:43:58] him you're going to give your life
[1:44:00] because friends healing is not something
[1:44:03] to magnify a
[1:44:04] minister or to get followings or to show
[1:44:08] off healing this is serious business my
[1:44:12] brother if you're not living right and
[1:44:14] you come here and you just think things
[1:44:16] will just magically happen you have a
[1:44:19] part to play you have to live right
[1:44:22] that's right you have to give your life
[1:44:23] to Christ that's right when you do when
[1:44:25] you do that then you come here we preach
[1:44:27] the gospel then you can be healed
[1:44:30] because there is no hindrance because
[1:44:32] the atonement has been applied that's it
[1:44:35] the token has been applied so Donovan he
[1:44:38] received the Holy Ghost yes sir what the
[1:44:40] prophet says and he was a young man
[1:44:43] uhhuh amen don't you ever think well
[1:44:46] I'll receive the Holy Ghost when I get
[1:44:47] old no dangerous the prophet says very
[1:44:50] humble German boy yes about 30 years old
[1:44:55] than two or three little children oh my
[1:44:58] I like this brother 30 years three
[1:45:00] little children already uhuh he's a he's
[1:45:03] an inspiration wonderful he moved down
[1:45:06] in Tucson just to be neighbors with me
[1:45:08] wonderful where three or 400 had moved
[1:45:11] to be neighbors and verse 32 paragraph
[1:45:13] 32 Prophet says and I'm glad to have
[1:45:15] such neighbors as that they follow me
[1:45:18] all the way from South Africa and
[1:45:19] everywhere around just to be near and be
[1:45:22] with me and be enjoy the pleasures of
[1:45:24] the Lord right now the prophet now says
[1:45:26] and I noticed Donavan on the right of
[1:45:29] his ear was swollen perhaps three times
[1:45:33] its size and looked very red with the
[1:45:37] Holy Ghost AM man amen you see that take
[1:45:39] your he was filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:45:42] but his ear was
[1:45:44] swollen take your you could assume that
[1:45:46] well he came to the Lord everything is
[1:45:48] going to be fine take your time no when
[1:45:50] you come to the Lord that's where the
[1:45:51] battle starts
[1:45:53] that's where your your mind becomes like
[1:45:56] the Gaza Strip that's it that's it when
[1:45:58] you receive the Holy Ghost that's it
[1:46:00] your mind becomes the Middle East that's
[1:46:03] exactly right preach my brother stay
[1:46:07] right it becomes like the donbas
[1:46:10] region glory to God but now thinking
[1:46:13] maybe that they they in the desert for a
[1:46:15] few days that way we had been that maybe
[1:46:17] he had got some cactus in his ear but
[1:46:21] taking a hold of his hand Propet
[1:46:23] sometimes would do this without telling
[1:46:24] you uh just hold your hand says I found
[1:46:27] out that it was a
[1:46:29] cancer so I say to Donovan I say Donovan
[1:46:33] how long have you had this on your ear
[1:46:35] just kind of to throw him off a little
[1:46:38] bit I didn't know how long has it been
[1:46:40] on there Donovan and he said brother
[1:46:42] Bram about six months he said I said why
[1:46:46] why didn't you mention it to me uhhuh he
[1:46:49] said oh s you are so busy said I didn't
[1:46:52] want to do it said I'm I just thought
[1:46:54] maybe sometime the Lord might tell you
[1:46:56] you you see he had a good attitude he
[1:46:59] cared about his salvation the main thing
[1:47:02] uhhuh I said do you realize what it is
[1:47:06] he said I have a good idea I said that's
[1:47:09] right and the second morning no more
[1:47:11] than that holding the boy by the hand
[1:47:13] the second morning there wasn't even a
[1:47:15] scar on his ear it was completely gone
[1:47:20] where is the prayer and the prophet says
[1:47:22] I didn't not even pray for where is the
[1:47:24] prayer because you know what the Bible
[1:47:26] says you shall lay hands on the
[1:47:30] sick I just touched his ear like that
[1:47:33] amen there was a quickening power in the
[1:47:36] hands of the prophet and the quickening
[1:47:38] power is here this morning amen you can
[1:47:41] get healing just by a touch amen amen
[1:47:46] amen even the bones of Elijah though he
[1:47:50] was dead that's it yet the bones of
[1:47:52] Elijah
[1:47:53] they resurrected a man who was dead
[1:47:55] that's right he himself was dead but his
[1:47:58] bones resurrected someone that's it you
[1:48:01] may be sick but you can pray for someone
[1:48:02] and they can get you
[1:48:04] amen it's a quickening power it's not
[1:48:08] for your benefit but it's for the
[1:48:09] benefit of the
[1:48:11] body glory to
[1:48:14] God but people say oh if he's the if
[1:48:16] he's the Messiah why why can't he serve
[1:48:19] himself from the cross it doesn't work
[1:48:21] like that
[1:48:23] elishah he had a stick he had
[1:48:26] nothing and he would ask the sh might
[1:48:29] woman what do you want he had no bank
[1:48:31] account he had never been to Bank of
[1:48:34] America he probably didn't even have a
[1:48:36] Social Security card but you would ask a
[1:48:39] woman what do you want you see the power
[1:48:42] of God is not for yourself it's for the
[1:48:45] glory of his name is for the glory of
[1:48:48] his name amen Paul when he was in prison
[1:48:51] he had nothing
[1:48:53] and he says whatever he owes put it in
[1:48:55] my account I will repay
[1:48:58] it because you know what he says though
[1:49:00] we are poor yet we are making many Rich
[1:49:04] amen so preaching the gospel is not
[1:49:06] based on what you have is based upon the
[1:49:09] promise don't look at the vessel look at
[1:49:12] the promise amen amen
[1:49:15] amen the prophet he was one time he was
[1:49:18] struggling to pay his tax tax you know
[1:49:21] but he would go and pray for people
[1:49:23] and then he goes home he struggling with
[1:49:25] his stomach because you know what he
[1:49:27] also had a cross to carry amen because
[1:49:30] there's a prize to be won but God does
[1:49:33] not give you the prize for nothing you
[1:49:36] have to carry the
[1:49:40] Crossen amen amen amen Elijah would say
[1:49:46] there's no Jew or rain that would fall
[1:49:48] unless at my word uhhuh and you look at
[1:49:52] the man Le the belt had hairs on him he
[1:49:55] had just
[1:49:57] $2 pants from the dollar store uhhuh and
[1:50:01] he would say a statement like that why
[1:50:03] because the Holy Ghost was in him amen
[1:50:06] don't look at your circumstances amen
[1:50:08] you are a son of God Amen what you pray
[1:50:11] matters before God what you say he
[1:50:14] matters before God you a son don't look
[1:50:16] at your
[1:50:17] yourself amen you have power to pray for
[1:50:20] someone in the church you that sister s
[1:50:23] and so is having an operation you go on
[1:50:26] your knees and pray that's it even if
[1:50:28] you are in a in a studio apartment you
[1:50:30] can pray and God can heal that sister
[1:50:33] that's exactly right you hear that this
[1:50:35] brother wants a job you go and pray for
[1:50:37] him that say don't say oh I'm nothing
[1:50:40] you are not nothing you are a son of God
[1:50:43] you have the you have the priesthood
[1:50:45] before God amen amen
[1:50:50] amen he would say
[1:50:53] when there was famine in Israel says
[1:50:55] there will be food in tomorrow this time
[1:50:57] there will be bread there will be people
[1:51:00] say how you are losing your mind how can
[1:51:02] you say
[1:51:03] that the prophet says now yes sir let's
[1:51:06] read Genesis chapter
[1:51:08] 15:6 and Bible says and he believed in
[1:51:10] the Lord and and he counted to him for
[1:51:13] righteousness that's right and he said
[1:51:15] unto him I'm the Lord that brought thee
[1:51:16] out of the of the Chans right to give
[1:51:19] thee this land to inherit it and he said
[1:51:22] Lord God whereby shall I know that I
[1:51:24] shall inherit and he said unto him take
[1:51:28] uh a haer of 3 years old and the she God
[1:51:31] of three years old and the ram of three
[1:51:33] years old the prophet tells us that you
[1:51:35] know the first two animals were were
[1:51:38] were females right a haer and a sheot
[1:51:41] right and then there was a ram right
[1:51:43] right all of these things represented
[1:51:45] Christ but you also see Christ in the
[1:51:47] church in the Old Testament and you also
[1:51:49] see Christ in the church in the New
[1:51:51] Testament Christ in the Jewish bride
[1:51:54] Christ in the Gentile bride that's right
[1:51:57] and he says and a to a turtle dove and a
[1:52:00] young pigeon yes sir and he took them
[1:52:02] all all these and he divided them in the
[1:52:04] midst and laid each one piece against
[1:52:06] another but the birds divided he not
[1:52:10] that's it William Maron Bram yes my
[1:52:12] brother now he's going to confirm the
[1:52:14] Covenant to Abraham yes sir this is
[1:52:16] Genesis 56 15 right and he said take a
[1:52:19] young Hyer now remember there's a female
[1:52:21] Cal take a she go of 3 years old each
[1:52:23] must be 3 years old right notice a
[1:52:26] three-year-old haer female 3 years old a
[1:52:29] goat a female a ram male right says each
[1:52:32] three years old and there is three of
[1:52:33] them she she two she the prophet says
[1:52:38] and a he right three-year-old clean
[1:52:41] sacrifices a lamb a haer three-year-old
[1:52:43] God and and then a ram and the prophet
[1:52:46] says and you notice everything there
[1:52:48] builds into a sign right and now we are
[1:52:51] supposed to preach dark
[1:52:53] we I'm not supposed to preach Doctrine
[1:52:55] from this platform here like today I'm
[1:52:58] visiting right and I'm sure that's close
[1:53:00] enough you can see notice it says now
[1:53:03] the two
[1:53:04] birds prophecy says one pigeon and a
[1:53:07] total Dove which are of the same family
[1:53:09] the P that talk about now he cut the
[1:53:11] goat the sheep in two he cut them RAM
[1:53:14] and the goat and others he divided them
[1:53:16] he cut them in half and lay them down
[1:53:19] but the doves and the pigeons he did not
[1:53:23] Divine
[1:53:24] amen there was of course anyone knows
[1:53:27] the scripture that Divine Healing see in
[1:53:31] both covenants amen amen oh my amen you
[1:53:36] see now Prophet says he split everything
[1:53:38] but the doves the young pons everyone
[1:53:40] knows that that that's the Bible that a
[1:53:42] dove was an offering for sickness God
[1:53:46] everything was split right but these two
[1:53:48] birds were not split that's right and
[1:53:50] the prophet says because there was
[1:53:52] Divine Healing in the Old Testament
[1:53:55] that's right and there was Divine
[1:53:56] Healing in the New Testament that's
[1:53:58] exactly right and the Divine Healing the
[1:54:00] the T dos and the pons they were part of
[1:54:04] the sacrifice right they were part of
[1:54:07] the atonement that's exactly right so
[1:54:09] salvation goes with healing that's
[1:54:12] exactly right you cannot have
[1:54:15] complete Ministry without healing
[1:54:18] friends amen that's what the Bible says
[1:54:20] right so when when you in the Old
[1:54:22] Testament there was healing now healing
[1:54:25] it was not cut one other reason is
[1:54:28] because even if you're a sinner you come
[1:54:31] on the prayer line you believe God can
[1:54:32] heal you the prophet says I've seen
[1:54:36] prostitutes coming on the prayer line
[1:54:38] getting healed and going back and I've
[1:54:40] seen God's children
[1:54:43] suffering amen that's exactly right amen
[1:54:47] it's a turtle do you were saved by the
[1:54:50] law then you are saved by grace now God
[1:54:52] split the H the sheep and so forth he
[1:54:54] split that open but the turtle does and
[1:54:56] pigeons he throw them in home showing
[1:54:59] that this never has God's covenant
[1:55:01] changed about healing he was the Healer
[1:55:05] in the Old Testament he's the Healer in
[1:55:07] the New Testament he's a Healer in the
[1:55:09] first pool he's a Healer in the second
[1:55:10] pool he's a Healer in the third pool and
[1:55:14] the priests they would
[1:55:16] administer the sacrifice the prophet
[1:55:19] talks about in the message if you read
[1:55:21] the message the wounded the the wings of
[1:55:22] a dove he talks about the purification
[1:55:25] of the of a child says they would bring
[1:55:27] dos is and the priest they were they
[1:55:30] were given instruction on performing
[1:55:33] this this sacrifice showing that a
[1:55:36] priest a minister is able to administer
[1:55:40] prayer for
[1:55:41] healing and if if if you had a breakout
[1:55:44] of fos whatever it was the Bible will
[1:55:46] command the priest to go and inspect
[1:55:48] that because if that's why James says if
[1:55:52] anyone is sick call the Elders that's a
[1:55:56] scripture but people want to do it vice
[1:55:59] versa when they are sick they want to
[1:56:01] sing the Bible says if you if you are
[1:56:03] married then sing if you if you are if
[1:56:06] you have got sin confess your sins if
[1:56:09] you are sick call the Elders but
[1:56:12] people when he is in sin he will post
[1:56:15] something on
[1:56:16] online when he's sick he wants to you
[1:56:20] got to place things in the word when you
[1:56:22] are mared sing when you are sick pray or
[1:56:26] call the Elders when there's something
[1:56:28] that is not right you go and make it
[1:56:29] right that's
[1:56:31] it that's it amen am I'm winding down
[1:56:36] the prophet the Bible says now and when
[1:56:38] they could not come nigh unto him for
[1:56:40] the Press they uncovered the roof where
[1:56:43] he was and when he had broken it up they
[1:56:46] laid down the bed wherein the Seck of
[1:56:48] the P lay when Jesus saw their faith he
[1:56:51] said unto the unto the Seck of the power
[1:56:53] son thy sins be forgiven thee so Jesus
[1:56:58] when he dealt with sin right he dealt
[1:57:01] with the sickness right because remember
[1:57:04] we said the prophet says sickness is an
[1:57:07] attribute of sin that's EXA so a
[1:57:09] preacher might come here he might not
[1:57:12] say you are healed but he's all is but
[1:57:15] that doesn't mean he's not preaching
[1:57:16] healing go ahead my because Jesus Christ
[1:57:19] he said Son your sins are forgiven that
[1:57:21] was enough saying that that was healing
[1:57:24] for the soul and the
[1:57:27] body
[1:57:29] yes Hallelujah do you see that
[1:57:32] friends amen I've got that Cote thank
[1:57:35] you so
[1:57:36] much amen and here in Psalms the Bible
[1:57:40] says bless the Lord all my soul and all
[1:57:43] that is within me bless His holy name
[1:57:45] bless the Lord all my soul and forget
[1:57:47] not all his benefits benefit yes sir you
[1:57:51] know people forget God's benefits for
[1:57:53] now God does not want you to forget his
[1:57:59] benefits take your time I have been
[1:58:01] working with you know retirement
[1:58:03] accounts you know for large companies
[1:58:05] and so on and one of the problems that
[1:58:07] the IRS has is people are not claiming
[1:58:11] their benefits and it's troubling the
[1:58:14] government right and God also it
[1:58:16] troubles him when his children are not
[1:58:20] accessing their benefits that's exactly
[1:58:22] and he's saying don't forget your
[1:58:25] benefits don't forget your
[1:58:28] benefits hallelujah amen don't forget
[1:58:32] your benefits my friends amen amen amen
[1:58:35] amen and companies they are compelled by
[1:58:38] law to tell people their benefits that's
[1:58:41] right Hey listen you can have a 400k
[1:58:43] account that's a benefit they have to
[1:58:45] tell you that there's a benefit and
[1:58:48] today is a minist of the Gospel I am
[1:58:50] telling you there's a benefit there's
[1:58:52] healing in the name of Jesus uh there's
[1:58:55] forgiveness in the name of Jesus uh
[1:58:57] don't forget his
[1:58:58] benefits
[1:59:01] ahen
[1:59:02] Hallelujah I always say that you should
[1:59:05] marry for
[1:59:06] character and beauty is just a
[1:59:10] benefit but you marry for what for
[1:59:13] character but there's nothing wrong with
[1:59:15] beauty if your wife must look very
[1:59:17] beautiful to you to you she must be the
[1:59:20] most beautiful person in the world
[1:59:22] so when you are married you are not
[1:59:24] after Beauty you are after character but
[1:59:28] character will come with benefits of
[1:59:31] beauty so we are not seeking natural
[1:59:34] blessings we are seeking the kingdom and
[1:59:37] his righteousness but the kingdom and
[1:59:40] righteousness comes with
[1:59:43] Benefits oh
[1:59:46] my you
[1:59:49] see you could be disproportionately
[1:59:51] blessed
[1:59:53] I'm using an illustration don't stay in
[1:59:56] the
[1:59:57] spiritual you could be earning
[2:00:00] 100,000 but your
[2:00:02] benefits are
[2:00:05] 200,000 you see now but if you don't
[2:00:08] access these benefits you're losing out
[2:00:10] a lot so these are the
[2:00:13] benefits there are benefits of getting
[2:00:16] married but that's not why we get
[2:00:18] married they are just benefits
[2:00:22] there's an ice cream in the fridge but
[2:00:24] you don't live on ice cream sir sir
[2:00:28] there's a dessert but you don't survive
[2:00:30] on desserts a so for you don't forget
[2:00:34] the benefits but also don't lose your
[2:00:38] mind over the
[2:00:41] benefits don't put all your ministry on
[2:00:44] the
[2:00:45] benefits stay on the main thing that's
[2:00:49] it and the benefit follow
[2:00:52] like the young men they they really will

[2:03:33] manage their finances they they just
[2:03:36] living from paycheck to paycheck there
[2:03:38] are principles in the Bible that can
[2:03:40] teach you how to be a good Steward if

[2:04:05] always refer you to your pastor I never
[2:04:07] answer a Bible question for someone who
[2:04:09] belongs to a church because that is not
[2:04:13] scriptural praise be to God and the
[2:04:16] prophet says a a year ago I was standing
[2:04:17] back there with Fred San who is here
[2:04:19] tonight believe my poor my son the Holy

[2:04:47] the time of the salmon run they'll go
[2:04:49] and eat salmon when it's time of you
[2:04:51] know sum before the fall they'll eat
[2:04:53] horses whatever they can find or even
[2:04:55] elk and and and and and and there lays
[2:04:58] the letter last week and I got it Friday
[2:05:00] coming here it's laying right there in
[2:05:01] the file brother Bram Oscar find his
[2:05:04] ponies in snow he says brother Bram pray
[2:05:07] that I may find my ponies the prophet

[2:05:15] the word amen whatever you may have lost
[2:05:18] you will find there Amen brother EV lost
[2:05:21] his car brother Bram prayed and they
[2:05:23] found the car that's right the prophet

[2:05:34] for you to come back yes my brother the
[2:05:37] Holy Ghost knows what you want he knows
[2:05:40] where your children are he knows where
[2:05:42] your mate is he knows where the young
[2:05:45] man to marry you is he knows where the
[2:05:47] young sister that you need to is wait
[2:05:49] upon the Lord wait upon the Lord amen
[2:05:53] amen amen amen can I have five minutes
[2:05:55] yes sir of course amen looking unto
[2:05:58] Jesus it says but if I come like one of
[2:06:01] some brethren and say God gave me a gift
[2:06:03] of
[2:06:04] healing we still have them
[2:06:07] right you know what the gift of healing
[2:06:09] is Faith in healing that's exactly right
[2:06:12] see you just release your faith to pray
[2:06:14] for somebody that's a gift of healing
[2:06:16] every Minister should have it everybody
[2:06:20] see should have the gift of healing amen
[2:06:23] the power that heals you is on the
[2:06:25] inside of you amen the Holy Spirit you
[2:06:28] just have have it let your Works its way
[2:06:30] out amen amen now the prophet says it's
[2:06:34] just a build up pressure it's the age we
[2:06:36] are living in a neurotic age that's
[2:06:39] right where people don't know what to do
[2:06:41] they where they are going the doctors
[2:06:43] don't have an answer for it because it's
[2:06:45] the psychiatrics being doctored by the
[2:06:48] psychiatrist and that's the age that we
[2:06:50] are living in this is why we are
[2:06:52] preaching healing in the word amen
[2:06:54] because you know what people are losing
[2:06:55] their mind that's exactly right
[2:06:57] sometimes you may think someone is B
[2:06:59] when they have just lost their mind
[2:07:01] that's right they may be Christians but
[2:07:03] they can lose their mind for one reason
[2:07:06] or the other right remember that woman
[2:07:08] who was crawling on her back with that
[2:07:10] Spirit the prophet prayed for I think I
[2:07:13] think she had I can't remember correctly
[2:07:14] I think she went into Mina they gave her
[2:07:16] a shot and then she lost her mind that's
[2:07:18] exactly right a shot amen
[2:07:22] so we have to stay with the word because
[2:07:24] we are living in the neotic age
[2:07:28] amen amen I'm about to close here there
[2:07:31] was a woman who has in poverty and she
[2:07:35] was in poverty right she she had

[2:07:46] the
[2:07:47] government they they came to investigate
[2:07:51] right like the deacons when you bring
[2:07:53] your need they have to investigate
[2:07:55] that's exactly right that's the
[2:07:56] scriptural order that's exactly right

[2:08:00] 5,000 and we give you like that we

[2:11:12] there's surgeries there's cancer but you
[2:11:15] know what the Lord will always raise a
[2:11:17] standard where where the law increased
[2:11:20] transgression incre

[2:11:25] there is Grace for healing this morning

[2:11:45] for you it was paid for I don't have to
[2:11:48] give it to you I don't have to provide

[2:11:53] telling you what you already have uh
[2:11:55] healing is inside of you God will heal
[2:11:58] you this morning if you accept it I say
[2:12:01] God is touching you this morning you
[2:12:04] don't need a special minister or a
[2:12:05] special gift the word is enough the word
[2:12:09] is sufficient I say the word is
[2:12:13] sufficient God bless you Church
[2:12:34] amen amen amen amen
[2:12:39] wonderful the bible say that he sent his
[2:12:42] word and his word did what heal them
[2:12:47] amen everybody can pray for somebody
[2:12:52] amen hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah do
[2:12:56] you know there was a
[2:13:02] woman in brother bram's
[2:13:05] meeting and there was one a mother with
[2:13:08] a child that was sick you know that
[2:13:10] story right amen and God made it because
[2:13:15] if if that woman would ever come back
[2:13:17] and tell people nobody would have
[2:13:19] believed her because brother Bram didn't
[2:13:21] say
[2:13:22] anything so God made sure that she has
[2:13:26] to go through the prayer line with a
[2:13:29] baby to confirm the
[2:13:31] healing that a sister can pray for a
[2:13:34] baby and when the baby get to the
[2:13:36] Prophet The Prophet has nothing to do
[2:13:38] because God already healed the baby
[2:13:40] through the
[2:13:42] system we made these things so
[2:13:45] complicated when it's not
[2:13:48] complicated amen when the word is coming
[2:13:52] and this is part of the stuff is coming
[2:13:54] from the
[2:13:55] ministry because it's it's the way the
[2:13:58] message things were
[2:14:00] presented we presented to pray to preach
[2:14:04] and you wait all the way to the end then
[2:14:07] we begin to call the prayer
[2:14:09] line so everybody who's sick are sitting
[2:14:12] there waiting for the
[2:14:14] end when you can get
[2:14:16] healed while they're singing praises
[2:14:21] because when David was singing praises
[2:14:23] this is what was removing devil because
[2:14:26] healing actually is removing the
[2:14:31] devil so you don't even have to wait for
[2:14:34] this minister to stop preaching the word
[2:14:38] when they're singing you can be healed
[2:14:40] coming to church just getting into
[2:14:43] church into a certain atmosphere you can
[2:14:45] get your healing and when the word come
[2:14:48] if you can get one thing which is the
[2:14:50] word of God
[2:14:51] that say that word is a
[2:14:53] package amen that's why people don't
[2:14:58] understand they want us to put
[2:15:00] everything on uh on YouTube or on
[2:15:04] WhatsApp and say this one got H this one
[2:15:07] got here this one got here this one then
[2:15:09] everybody will say well God is working
[2:15:11] in that church we focus on the M thing
[2:15:15] and God is healing the family God is
[2:15:17] doing many moving along because that's
[2:15:21] not what we really F if you focus on the
[2:15:23] Rapture B BR I'm say the Rapture is a
[2:15:26] revelation and it's the Revelation that
[2:15:29] faith that bring you
[2:15:32] healing you might be down just talk to a
[2:15:37] sister and let that sister begin to lay
[2:15:40] on the word just for 20 30 minute with
[2:15:43] you before you know it's your spirit is
[2:15:45] changed it's a healing
[2:15:51] Jesus say your sins are forgiven and the
[2:15:54] people say who's this that can even
[2:15:55] forgive people's sin Jesus say okay so
[2:15:58] for you to know that the son of man has
[2:16:01] power to forgive sin rise up and walk in
[2:16:05] other words there is no difference
[2:16:06] between the healing over there and the
[2:16:09] Salvation they are both together if I
[2:16:11] can say your sins are forgiven
[2:16:14] automatically it's there it's under the
[2:16:16] atonement it is a combo we don't have to
[2:16:20] say the word
[2:16:23] healing you don't have to say the seven
[2:16:27] Thunders when you preaching the message
[2:16:29] correctly you preaching the
[2:16:31] Thunders when the tunders are coming
[2:16:34] they go there we don't have to repeat
[2:16:36] that
[2:16:36] word all the time so you understand that
[2:16:39] we are really preaching the Thunders
[2:16:42] no the Thunders were the Mysteries under
[2:16:45] the seals
[2:16:51] it's like people waiting when you say
[2:16:53] when the when Luke 17:30 that's when
[2:16:55] they say Amen no
[2:16:59] no when we're preaching the message
[2:17:01] that's Luke 17:30 that's Malachi 4
[2:17:05] that's Revelation
[2:17:08] 107 Revelation 10:7 is an open book A
[2:17:12] book that was closed so we not preaching
[2:17:14] a closed Bible we preach an Open Bible
[2:17:18] That's the Bible that John swallowed
[2:17:21] John didn't swallow a closed Bible it
[2:17:24] was a Bible that has the seal
[2:17:27] broken so you can't preach a message
[2:17:30] that don't have the
[2:17:32] seals broken and every seal was broken
[2:17:37] so how can the seven seal not being
[2:17:39] revealed that's the book that he
[2:17:41] swallowed John swallow a book where the
[2:17:44] seals were broken and that's the book he
[2:17:47] prophesy so you can't prophesy without
[2:17:50] an open open
[2:17:53] book and when you prophesy with an open
[2:17:57] book autom medically healing will come
[2:18:01] that's why certain demon leaves you and
[2:18:04] you only realize after a while that hey
[2:18:08] where did this headache go because you
[2:18:11] were expecting headache in the name of
[2:18:13] Jesus Christ then you hear a demon
[2:18:15] moving you say okay now now headache is
[2:18:18] going you will feel you say Lord Jesus
[2:18:20] Christ heal me from this headache and
[2:18:22] you forget and you begin to do certain
[2:18:24] things and maybe after two hours you say
[2:18:27] wait a minute the headache was going you
[2:18:29] didn't
[2:18:30] realize that's that's the way he
[2:18:32] happened that's many things in your life
[2:18:35] look where you come from turn around
[2:18:36] then go see see yourself five years ago
[2:18:40] and then look at yourself today a lot of
[2:18:44] healing and God will continue to heal
[2:18:47] you amen amen everybody happy yeah
[2:18:53] people think we have to say God is
[2:18:55] healing you we can preach the trumpet
[2:18:58] and you receive the word and it takes
[2:19:00] the demon
[2:19:03] away or or for you to really pray good
[2:19:06] you need to go to medical school to know
[2:19:10] the name of the disease so you know how
[2:19:12] to approach God you don't need to go to
[2:19:15] medical
[2:19:17] school whatever it is it's a demon
