Amen. Amen. Amen. Glory to God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Affliction shall not rise up the second time. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; This is not the word of a man. &gt;&gt; No, sir. &gt;&gt; It was not even the word of brother Polycarp. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It is written in the Bible. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; How many times did you read the Bible &gt;&gt; and you never pay attention to that statement &gt;&gt; until it's read tonight? &gt;&gt; Many of you read Jonah. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Many of you read the prophet Naom. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But how many remember that it was spoken that affliction would not come? We will not rise up again the second time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If you notice, Jonah was in the boat and he was quietly sleeping. &gt;&gt; And the Bible say he was even sleeping deep fast. &gt;&gt; It's a deep sleep. Amen. &gt;&gt; And you notice people that cause trouble usually are carefree. &gt;&gt; Let's leave it my friend. You will go home. I will not uh get into it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The one that is in the midst of the storm, that is the author of the storm. He seems like he's not even caring. &gt;&gt; If he doesn't come to church, he's fine. &gt;&gt; If he miss a meeting, that's fine. &gt;&gt; If he doesn't pray, that's fine. He's more comfortable &gt;&gt; than those that around. Those that around are seeking for solution. &gt;&gt; But the one who caused the problem is usually the one who doesn't even seek for solution. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, I was thinking today about our friendship, &gt;&gt; our associate. Who do we associate with? &gt;&gt; Who hang around with you? &gt;&gt; Who's your body? And tonight, God is bringing Jonah. &gt;&gt; I was thinking about it. Amen. &gt;&gt; You see people deviating, people backs leading. Watch carefully. Watch who's around. &gt;&gt; Watch who's connected to that person. &gt;&gt; Either they have a worldly friend &gt;&gt; that begin to pull on them. &gt;&gt; They have a friend that is taking them to sport. or they have a so-cal message believer friend that does not live the life correctly &gt;&gt; because when I say the world many will rise up. Let me leave the world. &gt;&gt; Let me go in the message. &gt;&gt; Let me go in the message. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Your child is misbehaving all the time. &gt;&gt; Push the brake. Watch who is hanging with your child. &gt;&gt; Uh we will get into this. Amen. &gt;&gt; We will get into this time is already gone. We will get into this. But you need to be careful who you hang out with. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You can get yourself in big trouble in this message. &gt;&gt; When I'm saying this, you having a hard time to understand. &gt;&gt; Brother Brown, I'm saying get among preachers. &gt;&gt; H Now, now I shock you with that one &gt;&gt; because you didn't believe that one. Do you need a quote for that one? He said get among a bunch of preacher. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham say and you get in trouble. &gt;&gt; If if if among a bunch of preacher there is trouble, what do you think? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Sit down and examine who hang out with you. &gt;&gt; What is their spiritual life? &gt;&gt; That's it. That's it. &gt;&gt; How is their life? &gt;&gt; A man that is already complicated. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A sister complicated. Everything don't work in her life. Everything is blockage. And this is the person you hang out with &gt;&gt; to be the savior. &gt;&gt; Let's leave it alone, my friend. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; If something your boat is rocking left and right, rocking left and right, storm after storm, you need to push the brake &gt;&gt; and begin and get the light and begin to shine all over your house to see where is the problem coming from. Is it myself who's causing the problem &gt;&gt; or is it somebody in the family or somebody in my surrendering &gt;&gt; that has been the author of all the trouble that I'm going through? &gt;&gt; Because as long as Jonah is not taken care of, you're going to lose the the the where all the merchandise &gt;&gt; that was in the boat was in the sea. Everything that you took to go make business in the sea. You begin to lose after one thing after the other trying to lighten up the boat. &gt;&gt; The problem was not to lighten up the boat. There was only one solution to lighten up the boat. If they would have pick up Jonah quickly, everything else, the merchandise could have been saved. But the longer we take, the more we keep losing. The longer we take, the more we keep losing. The longer I know what I'm saying is strong, but I don't have any choices. Amen. It's impossible for you to be way up here and suddenly boom. No, no, no, no, no. Something is wrong in your life. If you want to pro to progress in your life, seek really true, good Christian, solid people. &gt;&gt; People that would tell you the truth. &gt;&gt; People that would not compromise with you. &gt;&gt; People that would look at you in the face and say, "Brother, dare you were wrong." &gt;&gt; People that would tell you, "Brother, this is time to go to church. We need to quit." Amen. &gt;&gt; People that would tell you, "Hey, I didn't see you in church. We need to go to church. Where were you at?" &gt;&gt; People that would tell you, "Listen, my friend, this is church time. I'm going to church." &gt;&gt; People that would tell you, "The pastor spoke six months about this meeting. I am not going to miss. IF YOU STAY, I'M GOING TO BE THERE." THESE ARE THE people that you hang out with. &gt;&gt; Not people that are pulling you back. &gt;&gt; SINCE YOU GOT THAT FRIENDSHIP, now you drop in your spiritual life. You need to push the BRAKE AND COME OUT QUICKLY. &gt;&gt; You didn't get me. &gt;&gt; You didn't get me. &gt;&gt; You didn't understand me. &gt;&gt; Watch who you trying to associate. &gt;&gt; Watch who you trying to hook. &gt;&gt; Watch who you are hooking with. &gt;&gt; Your new discovery that you love &gt;&gt; that is keeping you on the telephone all the time. that is keeping you busy with others people life &gt;&gt; and never talk about the message of the hour &gt;&gt; take Jonah put the man of water &gt;&gt; ah God will take of the God will take care of them in the water put them in the water &gt;&gt; you didn't get me God will take care of them in the water they will have the conference in THE BELLY OF A WELL &gt;&gt; BUT AS LONG AS YOU HANG OUT YOU GOING TO BE IN TROUBLE You I I I don't I I don't know if you understand what I'm saying. &gt;&gt; I don't know if you understand what I'm saying. You a married woman. Your friend are divorced. &gt;&gt; What? What? What is What do you think you going to do? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? Are we together? Are we together? You're a married woman and you're going through marital problem. I surrender yourself with people that are strong in marriage. &gt;&gt; So you BEGIN TO SUCK ANOTHER ENERGY. &gt;&gt; You begin to suck a different anointing that will push you through and move on. &gt;&gt; Not some Have you ever seen somebody who is uh who went through a problem? They will usually hang out with a person who went through the same problem and they think they helping each other. No, they have been like uh crabs. &gt;&gt; Are we together? No, they are condoning. They are comforting one another in that level. So whenever you call, it's about the same conversation. Ah, you know how people are. We don't we don't believe anyone. We don't believe church people. I was disappointed and this one say yes I was disappointed. No, God cannot live without a witness. We got to find a true Christian, a true believer, somebody that reflect the word. &gt;&gt; Look at who you are associating with. &gt;&gt; Young sister, look at who you are associating with. &gt;&gt; Young brother, look at who you are associating with. &gt;&gt; Married people, look at who you are associated with. &gt;&gt; Look at which couple are you hanging around with. &gt;&gt; Are we together? Look at the one that is positive, THAT IS FULL OF ENERGY. &gt;&gt; YOU SAY THAT SISTER, PRAISE a lot, I NEED TO LEARN ABOUT THAT SISTER. &gt;&gt; I NEED TO BE CONNECTED to that sister. &gt;&gt; I must, you must come in my life to bring me up. &gt;&gt; NOT COME IN MY LIFE TO BRING ME DOWN. &gt;&gt; If somebody Oh, &gt;&gt; you don't understand what I'm saying. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? Surrender yourself with people that are strong. &gt;&gt; You say that a pastor, I will call the pastor. I will ask the pastor question because when I talk to him, he talk to me about God. He talked to me about this one. I'm going to call brother so and so because every time you sit with him, when you come out from his presence, it feels like you are charged. You were talking about this. I learned something I didn't know. Those are the people that you surrender with. The hour is late. He's my friend. Especially young sister. He's my friend. We need to show love. &gt;&gt; You need to show love. &gt;&gt; How many times have you shown love &gt;&gt; with your love? Your love. Your love. We need to show support. &gt;&gt; IF THEY STRUGGLING, BRING THEM TO THE PASTOR. &gt;&gt; You didn't get me well. If they struggling, bring them to the deacon. &gt;&gt; Are we together? There was a young man now he's married with children. He was hanging around &gt;&gt; with someone. I said, "What are you doing with that woman?" "Oh no, we are uh I mean witnessing to the woman and everything." I say, "How long are you going to witness to the woman?" &gt;&gt; Because you keep hanging around this woman. If you already told them you are going to church and they know the church, take the woman and turn her to the deacon and let the deacon hang off. I mean take over because you are struggling. He ended up sleeping with the woman. &gt;&gt; See there see &gt;&gt; and now it was A PROBLEM OF PRAYING TO PULL HIM OUT FROM THE woman trying to do things that you don't even know what you're trying to do. If somebody is struggling, hey your love, your sweet sweet love, forget it. Call the deacon. You say, "Please, please see the deacon. Please see somebody that we can pray for you and get this thing out of it." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. This message is not psychology. &gt;&gt; This is not a psychology to be comforting the people. We need to show support. Everybody left him. No, she got A PASTOR. GO TALK TO YOUR PASTOR. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; You cannot carry your own burden. How are you going to carry 20 people's burden? You are young and before you know it, ah a lot of stuff are going because you carrying stuff that are not yours. YOU TOO YOUNG. FOCUS ON YOUR LIFE. &gt;&gt; PRAY FOR THE SISTER. FOCUS ON YOUR LIFE. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; ARE WE TOGETHER? BROTHER BRANDHAM SAY, "SHOW ME WHO YOU HANG OUT WITH. &gt;&gt; I will tell you who you are. &gt;&gt; Bird of the same water. They flock. How &gt;&gt; you are spiritual like this? Your friend is low. But &gt;&gt; and you want me to believe you spiritual. Both of you are together. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; Examine your life. See what's going on. If you are Jonah, my friend, call for a conference and get everything out before you causing disaster to the family. If somebody is a Jonah say my friend I see that we've been friend for a long time but I believe the problem that you're going through you need a spiritual leader to go handle this problem. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You are not qualified to have a doctorate degree and give prescription. &gt;&gt; So quit giving your prescriptions. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are we together? &gt;&gt; I even have sister blocking another sister from going to the pastor. Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't bring your stuff to the pastor. I say no problem. Whatever happened to that sister, you will pay for it &gt;&gt; because you are the psychologist of the message. Where sister will call you to tell you what is wrong. &gt;&gt; You are not there. When a sister come and begin yeah. You say you see brother Steven, he can talk with you 4 hours. &gt;&gt; Me, I will pray for you. But go see brother Steven over there. Go see the deacon over there. Amen. Amen. Because when they go God provided way, God is under obligation to s to to come and surrender. Amen. Amen. Make your job easy in this life. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. You are not built for it. Don't touch it. &gt;&gt; Don't touch it. &gt;&gt; Amen. A complain a complain. You say you see those type of complain you start here, it can cause problem in the church. So before we go forward and tomorrow, brother Stephen call me. Did you hear? You go deal with that person and call the deacon and you pull back and you start praying &gt;&gt; before you find yourself in the middle of a mess that you don't know what you're doing. And that mess cause you problem when you were climbing up spiritually. On Tuesday you pray on Tuesday you pray. On Tuesday you pray you begin to clam with the Lord and suddenly Jonah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Call on for a conference. Examine your life. Well, check your family. Check what is going on. Quit your how you are spiritual. Whatever. Put it down. You say, "Hey, this situation has been going on for a long time. We don't see any problem here getting resolved." What is the problem? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. Uh, somebody want to go home? Let's stop here. Amen. I'm just helping you summarize everything and putting together so you understand what the Holy Spirit want to tell you because God cannot speak like this and affliction come back again. Affliction must now rise up again the second time. Whatever you going through will be one shot and you come out of it and you go. Amen. But remember, surrender yourself &gt;&gt; with people that are spiritual, &gt;&gt; people that can help you in life, &gt;&gt; not negative energy under the name of the message. &gt;&gt; I don't care how bad they are. I don't care how they are. I don't care how much message they look outside. If what they producing is not true, just know you're going to work twice to try to build them to your position. And if you try then they cannot come to your level. You will be the one dragging down because they will suck all your energy. Every time you leave them, you have to repent. After you stop the communication with them, you must ask forgiveness because you murder yourself in the things that were not yours. Cast that Jonah into the water. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, and those that are online and those that miss tonight and those that will listen to this, get Jonah out in the water. Let Jonah go back to Nineveh to preach the gospel over there before you suffer a lot of losses in your life for stubbornness. Trying to work the situation out, trying to work the situation out, try to work the situation out. Who are you to be working the situation out? Do you know the cause of the situation? You are going with what somebody told you. &gt;&gt; Did you Did you listen to the other party? &gt;&gt; Did you listen to the other party? &gt;&gt; You heard on from one mouth and you begin to act according to one. I don't know why I'm saying this, brother John. Forgive me. I'm going to let you go home. You are You heard from one mouth and you begin to do things according to one mouth. And the day you going to hear the second mouth, I am so sorry. &gt;&gt; I am sorry. I thought I thought. How many times are you going to learn?
