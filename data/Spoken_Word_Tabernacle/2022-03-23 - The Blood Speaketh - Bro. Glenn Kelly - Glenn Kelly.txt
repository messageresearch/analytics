from here they can say did not our hearts burn within us as you spoke to us along the way we give you praise we give you honor we give you glory by faith we claim it all done in jesus name we pray amen and amen hallelujah i want to keep you standing we have two passages of scriptures i tell you i didn't i'll tell you we'll tell you when we get on the other side about testimony how i got here tonight let's look at the genesis chapter 4. verse 8 once you have it say amen and cain talked with abel his brother and it came to pass when they were in the field that cain rose up against abel his brother and slew him and the lord said unto cain where is abel thy brother and he said i know not and i my brother's keeper and he said what has thou done the voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me from the ground then let's go over to one more passage of scriptures and you may be seated let's go over to hebrews chapter 12. hallelujah hebrews chapter 12 and let's look at hallelujah verse 24. once you have it say amen and to jesus the mediator of the new covenant and to the blood of sprinkling that speaketh better things than the blood of abel may the lord add a blessing to his word you may be seated you know we're just looking at a thought here and i just prayed with us and got the inspiration out of the token the token and our topic tonight is the blood speaketh the blood speaking you know we believe in this time in the day that we're living in they've taken this lightly they've taken it lightly what the lord has done for us on cows right what the blood has really done you know we're moving somewhere it's been a while back god told us that we hear our origin is that right our origin is heaven we come from heaven we're going back to heaven we're thinking like god we were there before the word was spoken is that right he even shed a lamb before the foundation of the world because he knew that the things that satan was going to throw at us is that right he knew that the trials and tests that we were going to have but we want to look tonight by the grace of god be praying with us we're looking at the blood speaketh you know we're going to look at what this blood really is you know we're looking at in his time that we're living in now we're living below are your standards you got to take authority take authority of what god has given us in this age you know when the lord brother steve he opened up about that tabernacle and when he opened up about that tabernacle the tabernacle oh it just set me on fire i'm just oh gospel preacher i don't know much but i like to talk about jesus i like to tell somebody about jesus i like to tell them about the goodness about jesus because when you talk about jesus the goodness of god is that right sister is always there and he's talking about the goodness of god because jesus was good everything he did it was good is that right so we come we're talking about this tabernacle you know first when we came in the holy spirit has been working and showing us what's the main purpose he moses saw the plan of redemption god got to show us the plan of redemption you are being fortified to win back every sister every brother every family member you are being fortified to moving at is that right god showed us the plan god showed us the plan he said first she came in here what you had to make a decision is that right you know we fight against that spirit the organizations they always here in the institutions in other places they always say we got 50 decisions 100 decisions you know they're looking at it the way that the denominational people are looking at it the decisions we know is not like what they're saying and got to say his decision did they come and do what she has to what service that right that's her decision she's serving and then after she's serving she's what resting is that right so we come in at this she's going to be rewarded that's our plan we looking to get out here any day the situation can set forth the rapture any day you can look around you it's a glorious time for us is that right now we're signing and crying for the conditions of the church is that right they're signing and crying so in this time now but we're rejoicing saints we want you to look at this because when naomi was there resting when ruth came into that uh tabernacle where ruth was resting but the most powerful thing it was it was that brazen altar is that right now we can be able to go out and share with someone about true repentance is that right a godless sorrow bring a godly repentance that we don't have to be repented of is no longer is that right how why because the truth the word corrects the error is that right that's why the teaching had to come to correct any error the manifestation not just the the third pull we know the third pawn is the opening of the word god shared that with us but it's the manifestation of the opening of the word he's requiring a live life now you got to come on up hither that's why the holy spirit is telling you we thank the lord for luther we thank the lord for wesley we thank the lord for pentecost the restoration of the gift but we're moving into the bride age saints god save the best for last we're moving into an age now with an authority with a living life a victorious live life every day is that right you can live in the holiness and the holiness every day why because you're a new creature in christ jesus and all old things have passed away you no longer think the way that you thought before talking about the blood the blood speaketh the blood's speaking we're going to look at it and let's see what the prophet of god said about this here this token he preached it was so important to him he knew that you had to have it this is the hour that's why the holy spirit is telling us when you get around in there when you get in that resting place when you're getting that holy place sir this isn't that time you're supposed to be self-examining time is that right you're going to move into the holiness of holy but we're going to show you some is not just living their thinking they're thinking like a lutheran you're thinking like wesley you're thinking like in there you're thinking like the pentecostal there is no condemnation who those that are in christ jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit you do not let satan move you off your ground now once you got that baptism of the holy ghost you always moving forward everything is positive you're moving forward in these things i don't want to get ahead of myself i want to read this let's go back to genesis go to genesis let's look at king we know cain he was here genesis 4. let's look at genesis 4 and 1. it says in adam adam knew eve his wife and she conceived and bear cain and said i have gotten a man from the from the lord and she again bear and said abel and abel was a keeper of the sheep but cain was a tiller of the ground and then now you drop down here to uh verse 5. he says but unto cain and to his offering he had not respect and cain was very roth and his countenance fell now let's stop here for a minute now we know brother branham talked about cain was a believer that's the beginning what about the end huh he's driving on every demon force in our lives to sit there in the midst of us is that right that's why he's addressing intellectual demon forces is that right in his age here now this is more than just an intellectual walk we have to understand what the lord is doing in his age here now now cain was a religious man came build altars caged with the church came worship cave praise the lord but cain was minded katie did not have the revelation that was sent for his day god did not honor cain's worship why god i denied a good king's worship it because cain come he was not from that sea he was already mean huh he was already jealous you see so you see where that came coming from first john 3 and 12 said he was the seed of the wicked one is that right so we know it is our here now we're moving into a real battle saints because you wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities and powers and rules in high places we're not gonna go dig in that area tonight as wednesday but one day god give us grace we'll show you about these demon forces remember the prophet god told us he said in every act there's a spirit behind it is that right now you got to understand you catch the spirit of the age is that right blind miserable wretched naked rich of good saying we don't need god that right now god is moving in this hour here now gathering up from all four corners of the earth is that right it won't be long saints we'll be going home soon look at k k was a religious man he's from now he said look at very sis look how the grace of repentance is he said the lord said on the king why are thou wroth and why is thy continent is falling if thou does well see if you do well shall thou not be accepted what are you saying why are you keeping them there in the church an hour and a half you know they don't need all of that huh all they need is they saved is that right we believe on the lord jesus christ is that right we're going to be saved nobody's taking away their salvation but then when they got over there to ask paul said have ye received the what the holy ghost since you believe is that right god promised to tie every loose end is that right before he got out of here so he's tying his looses some is grabbing these mysteries intellectually somebody's got the revelation of what god is really doing in his hour here and now now god is fortifying you and he's fortifying you to to win this battle we don't want to get that but we want you to see god is opening his word for you and i by his grace and his mercy so we can continue to grow and grow in faith and what we're going to rapture on out of here one day saints is that right because why faith come by hearing hearing the word of god is that right faith comes by hearing see faith is a substance that you have it's already in there it's a substance it's inside of you you read the word by the spirit and anointing of god to build up your faith is that right pray so much in the holy ghost building up your holy faith is that right talked about it in jews we are earnestly contending for the faith that was once delivered to the saints we don't care nothing about the devil the devil don't care nothing about you so we come in here when we minister we minister in the devil the revelation is when he's up here when the minister's up here in europe there satan is trying to interject you with a thought instead of receiving the thought of god is that right buddy tell us what cast down every imagination that try to exhort itself against god we're going to show you why the holy spirit stopped in the holy we're going to show you by his grace tonight about that prayer how you missing it in prayer we want to show you that's where paul saw that our prayers was like incense is that right let me stop it cain look what he told cain he says what are the wrath why is that counseling his father if thou does well shall not not be accepted and if thou does not well sin lies where at the door and unto there shall be it shall be his desire and thou shalt do what all he had to do was repent do what his brother's doing he came out at first god wouldn't even put him over top of his brother abel he said you will rule over him people people they don't they don't understand the revelation of repentance it's a gift that's granted unto you it opens that door jesus is the door no way look what he says he said now verse eight he said and cain talked with abel his brother and it came to pass when they were in the field that cain rose up against abel his brother and sue him okay he probably was talking about his sister he probably was out there telling them about the goodness of god ah he didn't want to know about the goodness of god he wanted to have it his own way see he wanted his own way that's why you get angry why men get angry because he can't have it their way god said humble yourself he said now look he said and the lord said on the king where is abel thy brother and he said i know i know not am i my brother's keeper and he look at his old lying spirit on him too characteristic of a devil is that right not only he's a liar he's jealous he's he's evil let me keep going he says and he said what has thou done the voice of thy brother's blood crieth unto me from the ground now we're talking about the blood speaking you know brother brandon mentioned this i know is a lot going to tie in i'm trying to do my best to stay with that point but he was working it with that token he knew there was a person having that token that you had to have it if you don't have it you're not going to make it out of here just say it plainly tell them straight in his end time you have to understand we'll show you some things that'll help you by the grace of god but the lord already showed you now you move from your justification we thank the lord for luther we thank the lord for wesley but you got to move from their justification is that right now you move from that outer court and you move from that sanctification when you move from that sanctification then you're moving it to the baptism of the holy ghost and make the way for the person himself is that right but why are you waiting for the gift repent and be baptized in the name of jesus christ for the remission of your sins ye shall ye shall see now you're waiting now you're praying now you're laying for the lord we're going to show you what you're praying we're going to show you you don't go to your father as a beggar you don't go to your father as hoping you don't go to him you go to him with confidence knowing that you have done what he had asked you to do so you know you're going to receive it we're moving from believing to knowing what are you saying brother kelly what i'm saying what the holy spirit is doing he's getting you ready to fight this battle to win these souls back before we get out of here is that right we don't know where they're at but we will prepare god is for what preparing us he said let not your heart be troubled if you believe in god you believe in me also in my father's house there are many mansions if it was not so i would have told you so but i'll go away and do it and prepare a place for you i'm coming again that's our promise comfort one another with these words he's coming back again to get us is that right the butt look what he says look about praying in the blood this is token if you're writing it down paragraph 349. when we pray then we must present the token lord i have obey listen as you go to your father jesus has ripped down the will of petition you go to him with bonus and confidence is that right you shake the devil's kingdom he said now when we pray then we must present the token lord i have obeyed you fully i have repented of my sins see that tabernacle he said i feel that you have forgiven me i've been baptized in the name of jesus christ the holy spirit is upon me he said now i have need of certain things for your glory for the glory of the lord for the glory of the lord shine upon me i'm coming to you lord so you can get a testimony so you can get glory [Music] you ask you shall receive whatever you asked in my name he said look help me lord he says lord i ask for it it's for your glory it's mine now see then there is something anchors it's over it's yours then it's all over it's all over it's settled i ask for this i ask for it i must have it i want it for your glory ah for your glory for the glory of god for the name of the lord the name of the lord is a strong tower and a mighty run into it and they are saved let's keep going we're going to see letting the devil steal your joy because of certain situations buying that rascal he's a defeated enemy yeah he's a good harasser he's a bluff but he's a defeated enemy he'll show you you use the goods that god put inside of you calvary took care of it the blood of jesus christ let me keep going he said look help me lord he said what does he say what does he do then when you have when you can present the token with your prayer that's right brother with your prayer that's what the holy spirit been working with go to the throne you rode through the throne with the holy ghost presenting the blood in your prayer presenting in life in your prayers bring it to satan you know when a man is in there and somebody start boasting and they got around in there you might get some i'm not pushing athletics i'm not pushing sports but you know they get around there they might say something against michael jordan you know the owner down there in charlotte he don't say anything you know what he do he just holds his fingers up and you see them four rings on there he probably had five he can get one he just hold this up and show him he don't say nothing that's all you got to do to the devil humble robin point the calvary tell him what the blood the blood speaketh this is the hour saints the blood speaking [Music] we've been waiting on this thing yeah we've been waiting on this look what he says he says and you have you can present the token with your prayer it shows that you have fully come to obedience into the whole word of god obeying obedience is better than sacrifice the holy ghost is given to them who obey me he said look

eliza he was elijah was a man just like you and i but he said it wasn't going to rain what for three days why it was for the glory of god is that right joshua brother steve john sent him on a mission

playing up here the pool pit is the throne of god [Music] the word of god comes from here to fortify his children is that right so in his hour here now we're moving into something saints you're getting ready for a greater battle but the spiritual battle as we wrestle not against flesh and blood but against principalities and powers and wickedness in rulers of high places this is the organized army you ever see open you you take a look at old putting them when they show shots at him on the news or look at him you know okay he got that look and he walked through like this he know what he got you know the kind of goods that we got but we got something better he said do what he said how was the man rob god well man rob god he robbed guys and his tithes and offerings is that right but he said coming to the what storehouse is that right you think he got some armory ah we can go to the storm house we can go to god uh where all the artillery is being held is that right god is bringing us to work in his hour greater he says no are no weapons foreign against you shall prosperous we're not worrying about no bomb i know he said watch russia i know he said watch the bamboo curtain i know he said watch the iron curtain i know he said watch the purple curtain but he said we ain't worrying about russia he said what's destroying america's immoral living he said that's what's destroying america is that right trying to make wrong is right is that right poop hits them got weak is that right they want to tell the man that you want to give them an intellectual gospel and that devil is still sitting right there adam no change your life what you're getting now is you have to change your life will have to change or you go out that door you will get worse is that right there's nowhere to hide saints he said malachi 4 luke 17 30 revelations 10 7 revelation 19 he's sinning with a what a message he said that your message your message your message so forerun the second coming of christ uh and the message is the anointed christ that's back here on the scene again the holy spirit is that right time passed he spoke to his prophets now his divers time he's speaking through what his son the lord jesus christ is that right god has become the prophet of god 354 still with the token he says when we pray we present what the token that's right brother sam it says we have fully obeyed his word if you know you fully obey this word you don't have to waiver when you get down and you go before your father you go there you go there with a true word that's right sister when something is there not right we gonna show you how to claim it you will walk out here tonight it would be like zacchaeus when his wife got tired of being tired is that right she got tired of being tired with that old stubborn fella is that right she got tired of being tired with that old stubborn demon what'd she do she started praying is that right she started praying over there and she knew god had answered a prayer she looked over there at him and he was tossing and he was turning but he had to move is that right he had to get up early so he wouldn't miss jesus he said look paul tells us that the blood speaks that anyone knows that the blood is actually itself can't speak it's a chemistry is that right [Music] know that the blood speaks if you want to put that down you say yeah you look at genesis 4 and 10 we read that but the blood from abel cried from the grave is that right he was crying because at that time it was speaking against cain and we were speaking against cain but god heard that voice from the grave huh we're getting somewhere we're going to pitch you a little bit down the road like i said when you leave here tonight you will be banging up satan's kingdom it's an organized army satan has an organized army he knows how to attack us is that right he came to eve didn't he he'll come at your flesh that's why you have to always keep the word on your mind is that right keep the word david said lord i hear the word in my heart so that i will not sin against thee i will not doubt your word lord all your word yay and they father but if god promised it is going to happen the blood speaketh saints he said look he said now he said cain he says what about your brother said his blood cries from the earth against you his blood speaketh hallelujah that was a german tie seed of god down is that right what about him he said am i my brother's keeper and his blood is crying out his blood is crying out it's a token it's a token that he had been killed his blood was crying out against him let me say he says now if you get that and there you can go to hebrews 12 24 we read that he said the blood of jesus speak his better things than that of abel now we get ready to move into something safe we going to show you this here when you get the holy ghost and you got the token you are positive you are confident you can go to the throne boldly not just for yourself but for your family and loved ones is that right those that you're holding up under the blood these sinners so we're looking in his hour here now even we know that brother branham was trying to get us in to receive the spoken word but even in his later part of his ministry when he came up in meetings in the holy spirit anointed him he had prayer lines and things because he knew that they were sinners he knew that they were they were out some of them was just still in the outer court you hear what we're saying somebody's going to leave here tonight with the holy ghost if i'm praying up here don't be ashamed i saw a mother brought her baby up here one time she was going to catch the pastor before he left him off of this this pooh pit and she just came on up and brought him up if you need prayer you just come on up and we pray with you by the grace of god so guys don't be ashamed of where you're at we're not good you're not going to be lost and we're not taking away your salvation what he's saying you're moving and being converted you're moving you're being converted right now some are just at a certain stage in their life you're struggling with certain things you don't know why you're struggling with certain things but the holy spirit will bring it to your attention when in due time is that right just keep looking the calvary you receive your salvation your salvation have been paid for that's the promise that's why when them brothers they got in the old testament when solomon dedicated that temple brothers steve when they was out there they know where to look is that right that's like hezekiah and them brothers they knew where to look they knew to look towards the temple is that right say that prayer and thou can believe they knew god would give them grace is that right you remember the cross at the cross at the cross where i first saw the light and the burdens of my heart rode away it was there by faith i received my sight and now we're happy all today hallelujah let's keep moving token 9163 in paragraph 358 he says abel he was a righteous man he died he died innocent because he was in the way ah he was the way standing for the real revelation see for the real revelation he had he spoke it cried out the justice blood of abel cried out against king abel in here god is giving us a word in this word by revelation he said who do men say that i am some say you john the baptist some say he elijah some say you william branham some say you wanted the prophet who do thou say that i am he said thou art the christ the son of the living god is that right he said flesh and blood this has not been revealed to you so the church is built upon the revelation abel had the revelation he knew that god slew the lamb before them he knew that god slew the land before adam and eve he knew that he flew it so he said abundance upon this rock i'll build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it it can't move against the blood saints the revelated word for your hour luth the word that's why the holy spirit said he saved the best for last i mean brother brown they asked what age would you want to be in he was telling laodicea that's right brother this age now it's the fullness of christ now and it's back on the scene the word is opening saints is open to you it's not a closed vision it's so open vision whatever you need you can go to your one bag is that right you can go to your sack is that right just like david did hallelujah look what he says he says he was in the way jesus said i am the way i am the truth i am the life see that's where ruth was going was ruth called the revelation was root caught the revelation brother steve that that what she was no longer a moabite he was no longer a mother i'm no longer a sinner i'm no longer that anymore is that right what am i huh i don't cut the revelation you are no longer that old person the old person is dead you are a new creature in christ jesus and all those things have passed away let no one try to resurrect your own life thinking like god think like god you're origin you come from god your origin is from heaven your origin is from god you go back from god you go you come from god you go back to god the word of god the blood is speaking [Music] look what he said 359 but the blood of jesus christ not only cried out it did what aah let the redeem of the lord say amen devil don't like that we don't care what the devil don't like that we don't like it he's nothing but a bluff isn't that right yeah we calling him out now

what the spirit of god left out of her she ran brother benjamin and she started telling them what paul had did to him and they got around that paul and solace and then they grabbed a hold of paul and solomon and they locked them up and they put them in jail is that right after they locked them up and they put them in jail they was on a mission then and on the mission that god sent them for god

it's the word that's what he said to sister that's what makes it whether it's right or wrong the word is identified by the voice of the blood it says the voice of the blood is the holy ghost it says that brings life it is life and it brings life to the word and quickens it amen amen amen he said look here and we'll stop with this next one he said sure the blood speaks it speaks a better thing the old testament blood spoke of guilt let that sink in don't listen to satan satan if he's trying to bring you to guilt we just read it you repented he was baptized you asked god for forgiveness now you move on the blood of the encourage you the word of god not just any blood not luther's blood not wesley's blood not pentecostal blood but the pentecostal experience that the fire comes down and burn out any unbelief that's deep down in your soul is that right you've got the blood for the message of the hour is that right that speaketh better things not only redemption but rapturing faith of grace he said the blood of the holy ghost he said as the life it brings life to the word and quickens it he said old testament bring guilt in the new testament it speaks of what redemption in the old testament it spoke of death and sorrow in the new testament it speaks of the resurrected life of jesus christ it speaks it speaks of healing it speaks of joy it speaks of power it speaks of life it speaks of heaven where heaven bound saints don't give up now little bride and that same blood that was shed upon the ground that called after his brother and that had killed him the blood of jesus christ covers all of our sins and speaks peace and resurrection and power and life and healing and all the redemptive blessings all the redemptive blessings that the blood has shed for it speaks for us certainly the blood speaks let us bow lord god we know saints someone's here that needs the holy ghost and just raise your hand right where you at we'll pray for you god bless you god bless you god bless you everybody keep your heads bound except for the pastor except for the pastor but steve he says now he look this night you'll receive that holy ghost as peter spoke these words they fell upon their hearts the lenthil was a type of the heart apply the blood to the heart now we come and we're touching and agreeing we're claiming it lord god we've read your word on tonight father we pray lord

all done in jesus name we pray amen amen brother steve let's give the lord the big clap often hallelujah amen amen amen amen amen what a masterpiece amen amen nothing but the blood hallelujah hallelujah and the blood speak better things than the blood of abel hallelujah and this blood here it's speaking even about the rapture and the change of the body oh my god blessed be the name of the lord this is a powerful wonderful message we can never over emphasize on the need of the blood amen that's why paul spoke to the galatians he said who has bewitched you you cannot forget the blood as you keep moving the blood is still there amen this is where the importance of fulfilling the tabernacle comes when you fulfill the tabernacle then you can go before god with a token and you say father i have been i repented i have been baptized i have been filled with the holy spirit and this is what your word say i have obey your word that's why i'm coming for your glory and i'm asking this amen that's why jesus said in saint john 15 he said if he bad in me in the holiest and my words abiding you you shall ask what ye will and it shall be done unto you because you're presenting the token amen don't be afraid nobody is worthy to stand here only jesus christ amen so every time every day we always claim that blood and we're moving in amen but we know if he fill you with the holy spirit you can approach him boldly in the throne of grace and ask for mercy amen think about in the old testament a harlot could be saved by the old token and not only her but her entire family amen until god took that family and dissolved that family in israel and you cannot find a trace of the family of rehab it is dissolved and it's lost in israel the only time she popped up she popped up in matthew 1 and she popped up in the book of hebrew if i'm not mistaken among the heroes of faith and do you know she was the mother of who the mother of boaz that was rahab can you imagine rehab was the mother of boaz the one who's gonna bring redemption to roof you see it's all about the blood how many stories did boaz heard from her from his mother how many so when boaz see more about he understand what's going on he knows how to deal with strangers he knows how to approach strangers amen and he's the only one he loved his mother so much that he can love roof you see the wisdom of god did joshua told the spies that when you go to jericho go save anybody he didn't tell them to save anybody they were going for spying amen but god has a predestinated seed dead just like he sent our paul and silas to the prison because the jailer was there amen rehab was like the jailer in prison that have to be rescued not only her but her and her family not only the jailer but the jailer and his family amen they sent two in the new testament and they sent two in the old testament and both of them had the token amen the god who is reaching mercy no matter what's going on remember the blood and approach god now not blindly but you know what the word said with confidence with boldness approach him to the throne of grace and come closely in prayer and pray when you pray take your hand take your eyes off the circumstances don't look at the children don't look at what's going on go ahead and keep somebody was talking to brother brother and i'm what about cigarette but by them say forget about cigarette you keep moving that cigar it will fall off you don't have to be looking at the cigarette all the time then the more you're looking at the cigarette the problem you the more you're gonna get in trouble forget about it just keep claiming keep coming keep claiming and confessing claiming and confessing claiming and confessing before you know it things will change but i'm not gonna leave this world without a laodicea with my children all of them were entering that is my faith no matter how deep they are in the married clay or whatever they don't listen they don't want to come to the message i did everything that i can you are too hard on yourself for nothing if god wanted you to know what you're knowing now he would have told you a long time ago amen so stop sitting there i wish i knew this i wish i knew this i wish i knew this now that you know you remember the quote on sunday now that you know begin to move with that revelation forgetting things that are beyond now you start moving for those things that are reaching the hand amen so stop being hard on yourself oh the lord is unfolding all of this so it's my thought the reason why the family is like this god knew god knew that's what joseph told his brother they said joseph you're gonna kill us he said don't worry about it god knew that's god who allow you to me for me to be sent to egypt god knew what he was doing don't blame yourself take that hammer that you beat yourself on the head all the time put it in the garbage amen stand where you are if god rescue you at 2 forget about one if god rescue you at 20 from 1 to 19 forget about it move on from 20 moving forward that's it because you didn't know it you didn't know any better amen you were working with the talent that you had and your talent could not produce but what you had if the preacher themselves were in trouble what do you expect the congregation to do if you have a calvin on the pulpit what are you gonna do brother branham said calvin was a murderer i will show you the code to down the road what are you gonna do what can you do under looter what can you do you have to reproduce if it's two you're gonna reproduce two that's the two that you get sometimes you were under a legalistic pastor that's why you behaved that way sometimes you were under a uh a calvinist pastor that's why you behave that way now forget about what happened before we have a blood that speak better things than the blood of evil that blood is more than your clorox when you take your sin and you dip it in the blood even your past even god himself cannot find it so no more blaming take that condemnation off keep moving you say from now on that i know what do i know my children are already out in the world that's fine let me start claiming them let me start confessing and let me start moving that's what you do rise where you are and begin to move forward amen if you are caught under justification stop blaming yourself that's the reason why i suffered all this year under justification no rise up you say thank god now i know where i am move on to sanctification if you were under sanctification rise up and move into the holy ghost if you already have the holy ghost then move on to adoption hallelujah then the burden is not any more legalistic the message becomes a joy it's not somebody telling you how to wear no there is somebody else that is dressing you that is leading you that is doing everything for you and all the benefit of calvary belongs to you amen you didn't mean no harm you thought this is the way i can raise my child that's what you taught you didn't know stop blaming yourself amen they're already adult you don't have that leverage again like you could have have if they were two years old so don't blame yourself god knows how he can catch them if god catches them he catches them pretty good more than you when god catches a child he's going to take him all the way down and make sure he's dead and then pull it around and resurrect and say this is it not you you handed that child for a long time it's always failure get your hand off sister me that had the same thing brother brother i'm saying mida that's your daughter that's my daughter take your hand off say rebecca you want to go go rebecca turn around turn around you're not going oh no i'm not going no more amen don't worry about it we have a blood that speak better things than evil let's stand i hope and i believe somebody was strongly encouraged tonight amen when you're going through fight difficulty trouble remember you're not alone somebody's always there for you and if the devil is fighting you so hard that means something is going on in your life amen amen blessed be the name of the lord what a wonderful powerful message you can see it's not brother kelly he didn't know about your trial he didn't know what you were going through god knew it and god directed this message tonight so you can understand it's about the token and this token it's a powerful token and it's the same token that is going back to the jews to rescue the 144. so this message is going to go back to the jews and remove the old atonement and rip that veil completely from the eyes of the jews until the jews look they say yes jesus christ was god and they begin to weep what a power in the message of brother branham amen let's pray heavenly father lord we thank you for this powerful word of encouragement and this blessing that you open up tonight lord father to strengthen your children and to speak to them heart to heart for them to understand the very motive and objective of you unfolding your word father thank you for changing lives tonight and thank you for touching somebody thank you for breaking lord father that hammer that the devil was using to take parent to the corner to take mother to the corner to take older one to the corner regretting if they could have a way to go back again and fix things father you know everything and you say that the footsteps of the righteous are ordered by thee father sometimes we wanted to have a better way than this but you so fit before the foundation of the world that this is the path we need to go and all that matters lord is for your children to understand and to recognize where they are and to turn around and move straight ahead towards zion father we thank you and we ask lord that you strengthen your your servant brother kelly father when i look at him always remind me reminding me of caleb in the bible father his strength is still there but i know lord that after this his body will get weak lord because of the labor that he have labored tonight lord father i pray that a special anointing be given to him father may you strengthen him in a powerful way with the vitamin from el shaddai and father may you continue to bless this church and bless lord father this family and those that has been streaming online lord we commit them unto their hand may you protect each one of us as we go into our respective place and further remove every attack from the work of darkness and may you continue to consecrate us day by day and father may we get into that deep intimacy with you as we humbly ask it and committed into the name of jesus christ amen [Music] the blood [Music] way back on [Music] that gives me strength [Music] [Music] [Music] this mountain [Music] [Music] oh [Music] that gives me strength [Music] it's dismissed this evening and called my ears and it dries on my tears [Music] [Applause] [Music] it will never [Music]
