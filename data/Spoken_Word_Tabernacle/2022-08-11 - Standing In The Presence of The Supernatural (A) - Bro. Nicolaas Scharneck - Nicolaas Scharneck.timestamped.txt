[21:56] we can't shout loud enough we can't clap
[21:58] our hands hard enough we can't sing any
[22:01] deeper from the depths of our heart
[22:03] but lord jesus just to think lord god
[22:06] that
[22:07] coming to meet you is just any time now
[22:09] all the signs
[22:11] satan just pressing in in the government
[22:14] and the social world
[22:16] in the political world in the in the
[22:18] ecclesiastical world
[22:20] he's getting everything all just
[22:22] arranged for his kingdom father but
[22:25] lord jesus that kingdom will bow that
[22:28] kingdom will bow lord god and
[22:30] lord sister teresa reminded me coming
[22:32] down the road
[22:33] that there's nothing that's above our
[22:35] god nothing
[22:37] lord jesus we don't have to worry about
[22:39] anything
[22:41] every kingdom will bow to this kingdom
[22:43] we we have nothing to fear
[22:46] the children of god should be so relaxed
[22:49] lord
[22:50] father i believe we're coming to that
[22:52] place that that the hebrew children had
[22:54] when they could walk into the fiery
[22:56] furnace and say
[22:57] i don't know whether our god's going to
[22:59] deliver us i know that he can but
[23:00] whether he will or whether he won't i
[23:02] don't know
[23:03] but it doesn't matter we're not going to
[23:05] bow to their to your image oh lord god
[23:08] and the faith that daniel had in the
[23:10] lion's den
[23:11] oh lord jesus that faith will be here
[23:14] when you return lord
[23:16] it's our commitment to you father
[23:19] as we sit here and we hear the words
[23:20] that come across this pulpit and we're
[23:22] just mesmerized lord god
[23:25] we're just so thankful father you're
[23:26] mindful to teach us these things and
[23:29] lord when i
[23:30] think of the dedication that the pastor
[23:33] puts out lord god
[23:35] and i know i've communicated with them
[23:36] at two o'clock in the morning three
[23:38] o'clock in the morning just send them a
[23:40] text and before i know it there's a
[23:41] response back
[23:43] up studying that late at night it just
[23:45] makes me feel lord how much more
[23:47] dedicated should i be lord how much more
[23:49] consecrated to the cause lord
[23:52] lord jesus we may not be 120 lord but we
[23:55] can still be in one heart one mind and
[23:57] one accord
[23:59] help us lord god to get the intensity
[24:01] the intensity of the our lord god
[24:04] oh father lord jesus
[24:07] lord for this prayer request these four
[24:09] souls lord jesus we
[24:11] just pray that just lifting up these
[24:13] names michelle

[24:16] stacy and cameron lord not knowing the
[24:19] need but
[24:20] we know that you know the need lord god
[24:23] for all the unspoken requests lord god
[24:25] that's being held in our hearts father i
[24:27] just pray lord jesus
[24:29] according to hebrews 4 and 12 lord your
[24:32] discerner the thoughts and the intents
[24:34] of the heart lord god

[24:38] our
[24:39] all of our cares to you
[24:41] because we know that you care for us
[24:43] father

[24:46] come and minister tonight brother
[24:47] charnock
[24:48] lord that you'll anoint him father
[24:51] father without fresh oil from on high
[24:53] lord god
[24:55] lord jesus and give us receptive ears
[24:58] lord god lord let our ears be ears that
[25:01] want to hear they want to learn they're
[25:03] eager lord god
[25:05] may we have that desperation that the
[25:07] woman had lord
[25:08] the father when she found that coin was
[25:10] missing and she called the neighbors and
[25:13] and swept the house and
[25:15] lord but when she found the coin she
[25:17] rejoiced and lord if there's anything
[25:19] lacking in our character we just pray
[25:21] lord god that you'll minister to that
[25:22] need
[25:23] you go up and down the avenues of our
[25:25] hearts and into the closets lord god and
[25:29] you don't have to ask our permission is
[25:30] there something in there that's not
[25:32] pleasing you just root it out throw it
[25:33] away lord put it in the pit's health
[25:36] throw it into the lake of fire father
[25:39] may our sins go before us lord god oh
[25:42] lord jesus christ
[25:44] grant these things father we're just
[25:46] committing everything to you knowing
[25:47] that we're helpless but lord god you're
[25:50] an ever-present help in a time of need
[25:52] father we want to ask you that you would
[25:54] bless this offering tonight that we give
[25:57] it's a free will offering we give from
[25:58] our hearts lord god
[26:00] we don't give because we're compelled to
[26:02] give we give because we want to give and
[26:05] lord jesus we just pray that you'll
[26:06] receive it that you bless those who have
[26:09] and those who have not lord jesus so
