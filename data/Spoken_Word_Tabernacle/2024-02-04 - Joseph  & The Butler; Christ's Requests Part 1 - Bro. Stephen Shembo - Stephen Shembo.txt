since everything is clear and the vaccine went fine nobody cry with the needle praise be to the name of the Lord let's go to our scripture this morning amen the topical work brother uh Kelly you know when you go to the dentist they usually rub something before they give you a shot yes sir it's called a topical so I have to rub it again and make sure when I insert the needle you don't feel it much Amen brother Kelly if you would remind me we can do the voting at the end and give brother khma and brother John time to read while we worship and we come back and move forward okay yeah probably I usually I can even wait till next Sunday to pray for the officer is that okay just to make sure if there is any complaint or anything I address it and correct it and see what's going on and we move on unless everything is 100 but sometime a masterpiece is good do you know what a masterpiece I know I won't preach Masterpiece stay with what I'm saying I came across this uh I came across this um sermon and uh capping uh teachers to pray our daily bread last Sunday when I come across it I begin to meditate and to ponder it then the the Holy Spirit open up the cannon so I was trying to move into roof and the translation so I felt led to stop here and to parachute first with this first yes and then once we finish we move on with the translation so if I promise something I'm a human being if the spirit turn around and say don't deliver it now I have to hold on to it so don't chase me with a gun or something like that okay okay we okay so I have to deliver something today and help me please am can I finish it would you allow me to finish it brother Mickey you okay okay brother you heard brother Mickey let's go to Genesis 39 because if a small different pool happen here it's going to turn to part two just a small tou we will turn to part two Genesis 39 verse 23 so this is like the Capstone of everything we have been talking about the cring this is dy the Capstone so follow me carefully because somebody must be delivered okay your life is going to change okay follow me very carefully Genesis 39: 23 if you dare you can say amen amen The Keeper of the prison look not to anything that was under his hand the hand of Joseph amen amen because the Lord was with him and that which he did the Lord made it [Applause] what this is not a Prosperity at your home you might be seated this is not a prosperity in a good Palace Joseph Prosper in the prison in they took somebody they put him in a dungeon in a prison do you follow me this is the capping my friend okay and in that condition there in the prison that's where he Prosper he's not prospering in the land he's not prospering maybe in a big beautiful palace he's prospering in prison so there is a potential a possibility when you are in prison to prosper inside that prison am follow me carefully my friend Joseph amen Joseph prospered where I wish all of you were here because I have to learn this thing let's go to chapter 40 verse one if you thereare you can say amen amen I'm going to go slow because this thing has to drop okay amen chapter 40 verse one and it came to pass after this these things that the battler of the king of Egypt do you know what a battler is everybody knows if you don't know raise your hand thank you a king usually have a big cup that he drink his wine and there is a person that is responsible for that he goes and take the grape and presses the grape and everything and put it in a cup and bring it to the king that person is called the battler sometime they would tell him to drink it first first yes sir so that if something if there is poison there he dies first and the King doesn't die so it's a great job with a big responsibility because whatever the battler is bringing is going to the king bellies we okay now the Bible says and he come to pass everybody can hear me okay he come to pass Hallelujah after these things that the battler of the king of Egypt and his Baker had offended their lord the king of Egypt so they did something bad I'm going to focus on the battler okay the battler the battler the butler offended the king in other word the butler was guilty amen but Joseph was not guilty that's true are we together so this battler had the POS position we don't know his name he has a position and from his position he messed up and what happened when he messed up amen verse uh two and Pharaoh was angry against the two of his officers against the chief of the Battlers everybody okay the chief the top one and against the chief of the Bakers I'm not going to touch the baker amen because the baker will be killed you know the story I'm staying with the battler okay verse three and he put them in word in other word in confinement in plain word in prison in the house of the captain of the Guard into the prison follow me carefully the place where who Joseph was bound so we got a prisoner right here and in this prison Joseph arve first are you following me when he arrived first Joseph lived in this prison and not only did Joseph live in the prison Joseph prospered in the prison condition do you follow me and Joseph begin to take care of the affair of the prison yes you know the story amen and the battler when he offend the king they don't send him to any kind of prison they took him and put him on the in the prison that Joseph was there why bre why was he only directed to a specific prison and they made sure that prison Joseph is there so Joseph and the batt who have more experience on the prison praise be to the name of the Lord verse four and the captain of the Guard charge Joseph with them they give Joseph their responsibility and and he served them and they continue a season in the water so this battler when he got to prison he didn't get to prison today and come out tomorrow so there was a season that he was locked up in the prison locked up locked up for a season for a season in a prison but the good thing Joseph is also there thank you and Joseph served them in the prison we clear praise God verse 5 and they dream a dream both of them each man his dream in one night I will get to the dream in question and answer amen amen each man according to the interpretation of his dream the Butler and the baker of the king of Egypt which were Bound in the prison and Joseph came into them in the morning and look upon them and behold they were sad all of these are principle of dreams I will handle them when I begin to deal with dreams yes amen because we got question about dreams dreams I will get to that and he said verse 7 Pharaoh's officer that were with him and he sorry verse seven and he asked Pharaoh's officer thou were with him in the word in the prison of the Lord's House saying wherefore look you so sadly today so they already got some acquain the they now talk to each other and they said to him we have dreamed a dream and there is no interpreter of it and Joseph said to them do not interpretation belong to who the interpretation of a dream belong to who God hallelujah oh Hallelujah tell them tell me what I pray you tell me them I pray you if the interpretation of the vision of the dream belongs to God is Joseph a God so why is Joseph asking the dream I'm reading the Bible my friend Joseph said the interpretation of the dream belongs to who God and he says tell me the dream so God must be in Joseph are you following me are we together are we together the interpretation belong to God and Joseph say tell me the dream so where is the god that's going to interpret the dream in are you afraid no never that God is in you amen so Joseph here has a god with him amen am let me put it that way amen verse n and the chief Butler told his dream to Joseph and said to him in my dream Behold a what a Vine was before me because he handle grapes we okay now and in the vine were how many branches three branches three branches connected to his Vine amen three branches in the vine and he was as though he did what body the vine did what continue my friend and what and her blossoms shot forth stop and he Blossom and what and the Clusters thereof and he brought no no and he baded and he Blossom and what shot forth and shut for in other way brought forth brought forth brought forth what the Clusters thereof a cluster uhuh go ahead ripe grapes how many What kind of grape ripe grapes so this BR these three branches amen when they bured they blossom automatically they brought forth grape but those grape are already does he ring the bell somewhere does he ring the bell somewhere yes sir in the Book of Numbers chapter 17 ver8 the Bible says that it came to pass that on the tomorrow Moses went into the Tabernacle of witness and behold the road of who for the house of who was what and did what brought right here and did what and did what in one day are we together and the dream of this battler reflect what happened to aon's Road in other word there is something Divine hallelujah amen that is connected to this dream and Only God Can unfold that dream everybody together are we okay I have to go this way because when I'm sewing we move on we clear we clear the Bible says in verse 11 and Pharaoh's cup was in my hand and I took the grapes and did what press them into Pharaoh's cup that's the job of B and I gave the cup into Pharaoh's hand and Joseph said to him this is the interpretation of it where is God where is God please should I give you the microphone where is God Ah that's it God in Abraham amen God in David God in Joseph God in William Maran Bram God in you the hope of glory he says Joseph said to him this is the interpretation of it the Tre branches are what three days three branches are three days what happened in three days amen verse 4 13 yet what within three days within three days am within three days am shall Pharaoh lift up your head and do what restore thee unto thy which word is he using restore means what bring back to the original everybody okay so the battler left his position all the way to the prison amen amen amen and Joseph is saying that now you're going to be restored back again am you will be brought back to

different place back when we say restore we talking about Redemption bringing back to the [Music] part amen he had a position he lost it went down now the interpretation of Joseph is to take him back where he was and bring him back to the position remember he was guilty remember he did something wrong he he did something wrong Joseph didn't do anything wrong praise God verse uh verse uh 13 yet within 3 days shall Pharaoh lift up your head and restore you to your place and you shall deliver Pharaoh's cup into his hand after the what former man th when thou were his what you going back again doing the same job like before in other word if you meet the battler after 3 days he just look the same if you saw him six months before you saw him working for Pharaoh after six month you're going to see him again working for Pharaoh it looks like nothing happened to him are we together verse 14 this is where the key of everything is Let's Go 25 miles an hour but Joseph is requesting certain things to the B he say hey something good is happening yes the prison that you were living in for a season you're going to come out of that prison that condition that you are living in you're going to

kindness testify of me and bring me out of this prison remember those principle amen jum to verse 20 and it came to pass the third day MH do you see that which day third number three which was Pharaoh's what birthday birthday is in the Bible amen that he made a feast it's in the Bible I just read it to you birthday is in the Bible the first one who who had the birthday party is pharaoh and the opening of The Seven seal he says on which was Pharaoh's birthday on the birthday the day Pharaoh was born that's the day he came out on the birth day of pharaoh that he made a fish to all his servant and he lift up the head of the chief Butler and of the chief Beaker among his servant and did what and He restored the chief Butler he Resto look at that word he restore the chief battler to his what brother again again back again to the original position he and he gave him and and he gave the cup into water hand and we know what happened to the chief Becker the Hang him but we are handling the battler sir everybody okay so far job 2 chapter 41 let's go to verse eight if you dare you can say amen and he come to pass in the morning that the spirit was trouble Pharaoh has a dream and he sent and called for all the Magician of the of Egypt and all the wise men thereof let me jop this I have to follow the spirit okay go back to verse 40 go to verse 23 the last one bear with me my friend yet did not the chief ble what remember Joseph but he did what the chief battler didn't remember him now let's go where we were in verse eight and it came to pass in the morning that the spirit was troubled this is pharaoh and he sent and called for all Magician of Egypt and all the wise men amen amen all the wise men thereof and Pharaoh told them his dream but there was none that could interpret them to Pharaoh then spoke the what so God created a scenario to bring Joseph back again in the remembrance of the chief battle even if you forgot God will create something and you going to remember where you were before everybody okay everybody good oh my God glory to God he says I could I wish I could duplicate myself and I'm sitting there listening to the sermon amen he says oh my God he says then uh spoke the chief battler to Pharaoh saying I do remember my fault this day amen Pharaoh was angry with his servant and put me in word in the captain of the guard's house both me and the chief Baker and we dream a dream in one night I and he we dream each man according to the interpretation of his dream and there and there was there with us a young man a Hebrew servant of the captain of the guard and we told him and he interpret to us our dreams to each man according to his dream he did interpret and it came to pass as he interpreted to her so he was me He restored to my office and him he did what after the CH Pharaoh testify which is the third request before Pharaoh amen amen what is the result what is the result verse 14 then Pharaoh sent and called Joseph and they brought him how do you know what it means quickly they brought him when you testify he brings him quickly remember when when he testify Joseph they brought him quick remember that the testimony bring him quickly and they brought him hly out of the dungeon and he shave himself and did what changed his rment and came into what so he removed the prison reignment and he put out the rment to appear in the face of pharaoh so when you testify you will cause Joseph to come quickly and you will change also the Garment of Joseph am because you left him in prison everybody okay let's go to Luke chapter 23 and then we saw Luke chapter 23 Oh Glory to God May somebody stop the time like Joshua if you there you can say Amen am Luke 23:34 uh 39 and and one of the malactor which were hang railed on him saying if you be Crist do what thyself and us remember Jesus here with two malefactor Joseph with two people hallelu are we together but the others answering rebuke him rebuke the other one saying do not you fear God seeing you are in the same condemnation and we indeed justly remember these people were guilty Jesus was not guilty Joseph was put in the prison by a false accusation Jesus was put on The Cross by a false accusation but they two they were guilty oh glory to God he says and we indeed justly for we receive the due reward of our what our in other word we give guilty for this we deserve this but this man has done what nothing nothing wrong and he said to Jesus Lord do what remember me amen the Sinners at the cross thought Lord what remember me continue remember me when thou com into thy kingdom so he understood that Christ has a kingdom amen so Christ came down from his kingdom amen amen and he knew that Christ is going to go back to his kingdom and he said when you come remember me when you come in your power in your kingdom everybody okay he says remember me when you come into your kingdom and Jesus said to him what I say unto thee when today sh thou be with me in par which day today today you shall be with me where in Paradise let me read this and we go in John chapter 18:36 the Bible said Jesus answered my kingdom is not in this world we talking about that Kingdom if my kingdom were of this world then would my servant do what that's why he thought Peter put the sword back amen that I should not be delivered to the what but now is my kingdom not from water my subject this morning is Joseph and the battle Christ request plural one two three four Joseph and the battler yes everybody clear everybody clear what are you trying to preach this morning Pastor let's go to Isaiah 55 Hallelujah glory to God Isaiah 55 if you there you can say amen amen Isaiah 55 verse 8 and you will get a little break on the scripture amen the Bible say for my thoughts I not your thoughts so there is a big difference between your thoughts my thoughts and the thoughts of God put your seat belt my friend for my thoughts are not your thought neither are your ways my way say who the Lord so your thoughts and the thoughts of God are different amen your way and the ways of God are different the way we do things and the way God does it things are different are you following me are you following me verse 9 for as the what Heavens are higher than are higher than the earth so are my ways how higher than your ways and my thought than what that's why it's difficult sometime to understand God because God's way are higher God's thoughts are higher his way of working is higher than the way we work when we think we fail God is still laughing because his ways are different because his thoughts are different when you think you hit the corner God say that's where I want them to be that's where I can show my power when Israel hit the Red Sea and they thought that they white Corner the Red Sea in front of them the Wilderness over there Pharaoh behind God say that is my way that is my thought and he open up the way and let Israel pass through and swallow up Egypt your thoughts is not God [Applause] thoughts your ways are not God's way God's way is always better God s for you thoughts to prosper to give you an expected end are we together are

God say I'm going to heal brother Greg God will take his word and wrap it with healing in other word when brother Greg is heal God begin to get happy if you ask God why are you happy he said Greg is here because that's what I [Applause] pleas oh my God he says but he shall accomplish that which I did what and it shall do what Pros 15 miles an hour he shall do what prosper in the thing I sent his word will do what Prosper so when God send his word his word will do what Prosper so whatever God speak to you must Prosper Hall in other word the word God send you have fertilizer it's already built with fertilizer when it come in your life even if you are in the wilderness the fertilizer will fertilize the soul and bring forth what God want you it doesn't matter the soul the word is a package the word has everything he shall do what prosper in the F which what I send so when God send his word his word is his pleasure that pleasure is his will and he will always prosper in other word God cannot teach you in this church everything he taught you without something happening in your [Applause] [Music] [Applause] life all the sermon you are receiving on Sunday on Wednesday in this church I have a purpose [Music] those seron will not come back to God until he have done what he was preached for [Applause] hallu hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah because God won't forget you he remember his promises listen to this my friend the Bible says in Hebrews chapter 6 for God is not what to do what what and what of what when you leaving this message you don't leave the message because of commandment but because of love and whatever you do for love God will never forget [Music] it listen my friend he says God is not a righteous to do what your what the work the work of who your works and what labor the labor of who of what love which ye have what show toward what name in that you have done what Minister and do what so God can I teach you all this series for passing his time he has a purpose in other word god want to accomplish something and he will make sure he [Applause] happen listen my friend in the seventh brother Bram say why he said they what every remembering God who remember what every promise of word oh I like to preach on that God don't forget though he looks like even if you give somebody a little water God will never forget [Applause] [Music] that every amen you saying in this church God will not forget [Applause] that he says like he told whoes Israel has been what down there how many years years but they had to do what go up that time he T who Abraham and his seed will be suring where in a Strange Land for what 400 years then he bring them out with what a hand but then he said to Moses I have what remember my prise and I have what come down to do what to make good what I said because God watches over his [Applause] word God does not what he doesn't forget what neither does he forget [Music] what but every promise that he made he [Applause] what everybody okay because the will of God is this beloved I wish that you do what [Applause] Prosper above what all that you do what Prosper prosper and be what even as what th Soul God's will is for you to prosper and to be in good health so if God wants you to prosper and to be in good health it means you will be attacked by [Applause] sickness in other word god already saw poverty God already saw hardship God already saw financial trouble he saw covid he saw cancer he saw kidney disease and God when he look at that it's against his his desire it's against his pleasure so therefore God spoke that he want you to prosper and to be good health as your soul prosper in other words there is a medication against your trouble there is a medication against your trial your situation have a medication your situation have an answer and that is that is his will 2 Chronicle 20:20 my friend read it my friend and they Rose early in the morning you read like me you go and they Rose early in

and said hear me oh Judah uhhuh and ye inhabit of Jerusalem okay believe in the Lord your God and what happened so shall you be established okay and believe who and you shall do what so we believe a prophet if I believe a prophet what should happen to [Applause] me you don't know my prophet put the camera here I believe in Malachi 4 William Mar bramall and because I believe on the prophet God's will is for me to do what because I believe on a Vindication [Applause] prophet yes Hallelujah everybody together everybody together God will is for you to do what and be [Applause] what because God doesn't speak empty word when God speaks something must happen if not God will shut up when God break a seal somebody must Shout everybody okay everybody okay our story here started with Joseph Joseph first went to prison and he did what brother brandham say every scripture have a compound meaning means every scripture have many angle he also have many application so today let's Define our Joseph who is our Joseph everybody okay everybody okay brother Bram say that was what Christ in what that made him what portray Christ how exactly sold for what 30 pieces of silver Lov by the headed by what into this what like who where on the cross on the what one one was save one was save and the buter and the and the buter and the but and one was sa and the other was what L how many things Joseph was born with a gift love of his father hatred of his brother like Jesus was love of God hated off the Jew and they lied to him and they sold him for almost 30 pieces of silver and they saw Jesus Christ for almost what 30 pieces of silver and when they took Joseph they remov his remant and they put Joseph into a dungeon and they took his Remnant and they send it back to his father because when Jesus Christ was dying going to hell he have to send his Spirit back to God are we together are we together are we together are we together and when they took him falsely accus they put him in the prison he found the battler and the baker one was hang and one was Sav at the cross Jesus Christ one was hang one was C Amen in other word Christ was portraying Joseph everybody okay everybody okay in other word our Joseph this morning is Jesus [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Christ are we together are we together are we clear together are we clear together and notice now that before the battler get into the prison Joseph went first it in the prison and he went into the prison accused falsely everybody okay everybody okay before your trouble happened Jesus Christ already went [Applause] there is a difference of being in prison guilty or being in prison non guilty everybody okay if you did something wrong and they put you in prison you know what you did and you know what you deserve but if you didn't do anything wrong and they put you in prison then it is [Applause] painful in other word chist pain is greater than your pain Christ suffer more than you that's why water and blood separated brother Bram say he died of grief he was not the spe but he was the grief it was the regret that his own people sold him for something he never done they even manufactur li to condemn him he went to prison non guilty we were guilty but the good thing he went before you were born there is nobody in this church or internationally listening to me that was born before Jesus Christ everybody after Jesus Jus Christ in other words the trial you have to go into it Christ experience that trial first he knows the prison he knows the smell of the prison he knows the color of the prison he's a high priest that understand you [Applause] better Lord help me in Hebrew 2 verse 16 the Bible say for verily he what in him the nature of what because if he takes the nature of an Angel he won't understand you an angel can cross here me and you we cannot cross if we tell an angel we cannot cross he doesn't understand so if Jesus would have taken the nature of an Angel he would not have understand me and you so he have to take your nature he has to come to your [Applause] prison he says but he took on him what human being wherefore in what all it behooves him to be made what like un not different than you and [Applause] me the PRI that they put Joseph and the prison they put the B is the same prison are we together are we together your body and the body of this man same material the same way we struggle with even lasting everything his body was subject to that one day he was even hungry and he cursed a tree so in everything he looks like you your Tri and his trial were the same but he was just trying non guilty he was innocent but we were guilty he says that in off things he beh him to be made like whatto his why that he might be a merciful and faithful high priest that he might be a what merciful and what faithful high priest in things pertaining to what God because if the high priest is not made in the same element as you he will not understand you if a pastor is not human he will be condemning you for everything but God put a pastor to be like you so when you come and talk to the pastor his heart is like your heart he understand things also he can S as a human being because he's also human do you follow me do you follow me he says that he might be what merciful and what faithful in things pering to who God to make what for the what of people so when you understand the people when you are on the same nature and the high priest himself fail when he sees the people coming with their failure the high priest won't judge too much because he remember what happened to him because Jesus Christ was in heaven in heaven he was a spirit and he turned into a logos but you cannot kill God everybody okay so Christ have to be very in flesh so he can understand you and me so when you say headache Jesus knows when you say hungry Jesus knows so your prison is the same prison he went through but he went through first that's right and he prosper in that prison there was no temptation that knocked Jesus Christ down Jesus Master every Temptation in his body he overcome everything yes sir before you were born for a purpose because he knew you're going to leave your position and you're going to go down into the dungeon when you get there you see him there and he said don't worry I was here before huah I understand your problem in three days you going to come [Applause] outall are we together he says for in that the message in that he himself has what suffer being being how temp he's able to do what that are what the way we portray Jesus Christ in Galilee it's like when Jesus was going some Holiness was sweeping the whole land the Bible says that he was tempted the same way you are tempted Jesus Christ also was tempted so Jesus didn't sin because he was the word made flesh and we byass at the offering sir but he was tempted just like you and the Bible says the reason why he was tempted like you is so that he would know how to come in your help how to secure you so when you in trouble Jesus understand that trouble and he knows when you say 911 he knows what happened to you he comes quickly to rescue you because he went there first listen to this my friend in Hebrews chapter 4 verse 14 the Bible says seeing then that we have what a great high priest that is how pass into the heav what is his name Jesus the son of God let us do what hold our confession for we have not a high priest that cannot be touched by the what but in what how many point so in other word there is no temptation that can happen to you that Jesus doesn't know amen amen internet was not in the time of Jesus uhuh but the demon of internet was there with Jesus Christ so if you struggling with inet Jesus understand the demon behind it because he was tempted in all point in other way no matter how many things the devil will manifest and bring new to make you fall none of them is new to [Music] Christ in all point two ter all teren Jesus already covered the whole Space listen to this he was tempted like who as we are yet what let us therefore come how unto the what of because the one who's sitting on the throne understands you that's why you don't go to the throne of grace like this no no no because you don't know him the one who sitting there is a human being he understand my struggle that's why devil if you think this is what is going to make me down I'm going to the throne of [Applause] grace I am going to the throne of grace how I say father look at that demon he's the one he's troubling me every day you remember you knock him off you are the Big Brother come and do it [Applause] again because you are the same and forever so when we approach the throne of grace how do we go B boldly that we may obtain how mercy and find what Grace to help to up [Music] when so prayer should be a privilege when you are struggling prayer is a privilege prayer is your phone call to call 911 and say big brother somebody's right here I have been battling with him I can't overcome him but I remember you were tempted in no point you remember this demon he says what is name and Jesus look he say I remember I knock him off when I was in Galilee tell him I'm coming to the rescue and the demon will walk away when he understand that the big boss is coming everybody clear everybody clear so Joseph went to your prison first he understand you better and he served the battler in the prison just as Christ is is serving you today because Christ understand your weakness Jesus understand who you are he went first he came first he died on Calvary he understand the pain of being gossip it he understand the pain of being falsely accused he understand the pen of somebody speeding on you he understand the pain of sickness because brother Bram said they gave him 39 strap based on the number of diseases in the world I have the quat my friend brother Bram said the reason why they give him 39 because there is 39 short of diseases in the entire world so the whole package of disease was on him so there is no sickness that he doesn't understand that's why he's in that prison first if if you have kidney trouble Christ is already there whatever you suffering he's there sir and in three days you must come [Applause] out everybody okay in 3 days you must come out hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah he came to the prison first in order to wait for you yes sir amen notice Joseph never came out of the prison until the battler first came out so your deliverance was already there first yes sir yes sir that prison of sickness that prison of trial
