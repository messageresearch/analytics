[30:03] Let's all stand. Amen. Let's just bow
[30:07] our
[30:09] heads. Victory is mine, Lord Jesus.
[30:14] Oh God, how could we acquire this
[30:16] victory if it was not for
[30:20] you? I'm reminded Moses, oh Father God,
[30:23] in the Old Testament. You told Abraham
[30:26] that your seed will possess the gates of
[30:29] their
[30:30] enemy. Oh, Father God, we've seen Moses
[30:33] possess the gates. We've seen Joshua
[30:36] possess the gates. Oh father, we've seen
[30:39] Daniel, the children of um the three
[30:42] Hebrew children possessed their
[30:44] gates. But Father, as time went on, oh
[30:47] God, we noticed there was cemeteries.
[30:50] Oh,
[30:51] Father, all those mighty
[30:53] conquerors, although they possessed the
[30:55] gates of their enemies, there's one
[30:57] enemy they could not possess and that
[31:00] was death. Lord, each one of them
[31:04] regardless of the numbers. Oh, Father
[31:06] God, David killing Goliath. Oh, Father
[31:08] Samson destroying the army of the
[31:11] Philistine. They all had to die and they
[31:14] could not conquer the gates of
[31:18] death. But one day there was a mighty
[31:20] conqueror that came. Oh Jesus, the
[31:24] Messiah,
[31:26] born of a virgin, God himself in flesh.
[31:30] It took you, oh God, to come down, oh
[31:33] Father God, and to go conquer the gates
[31:36] of death, hell, and the grave. And
[31:39] because of that, oh Father God, victory,
[31:42] we can sing today. That day on Calvary,
[31:46] the devil stung the wrong man. He put
[31:49] his thing of death inside of you, oh
[31:50] God, and you pulled it out of him, and
[31:53] you went to hell. You demanded the keys,
[31:56] oh Father. That's why we've just
[31:58] celebrated Easter, oh Father God. It's
[32:00] not just an event, oh God, a memorial,
[32:04] but it's reality. Truly, you came out of
[32:08] the the the grave, oh Father God, and
[32:10] your great resurrection. And today,
[32:13] because of that, we can say that truly
[32:15] we have the victory over death, hell,
[32:17] and the grave. We thank you for that, oh
[32:20] God. And we can come and sing the songs
[32:22] of Zion because of your victory, Father.
[32:25] You made us mighty conquerors because of
[32:27] that cross, oh Father God. And today we
[32:30] are who we are by your grace, Lord. And
[32:33] one day we will be with you forever,
[32:36] Father God. Take our service tonight,
[32:38] Lord Jesus, as your presence already
[32:40] being felt here. Because of that
[32:43] victorious day, oh God, you can come and
[32:45] live in us. Oh God, because of that
[32:48] blood that was shed, oh Father, you can
[32:50] come and live in us, oh God. And truly,
[32:52] we see you living in us. We have
[32:54] testimonies left and right, oh Father
[32:56] God. We we we see you responding to our
[32:59] prayers, oh God. And we want to say
[33:01] thank you tonight. Father, may you bless
[33:04] this contin of this service, oh God. May
[33:06] you take the tithes, the offering. You

[33:13] this building by faith, Lord. Amen. May
[33:16] you come, oh father god, and anoint each
[33:18] one of our faith, oh father god. And
[33:20] once we see the end product, oh truly we
[33:23] shall raise our hands to you, Lord, in
[33:26] praise and we shall glorify your holy
[33:28] name. Father, thank you for the word

[42:36] Oh, glory to God. Can you hear me? Okay.
[42:39] Blessed be the name of the Lord, brother
[42:41] Paul. That are we together? Are we
[42:44] together?
[42:48] Wonderful. Wonderful. Keep singing for
[42:50] the Lord. Amen. And he's singing, being
[42:54] happy, and being himself. That's what we
[42:57] want. Glory. Glory. Sister Joela, you'll
[43:00] be next.
[43:05] The miracle baby. Blessed be the name of
[43:08] the Lord. Amen. We greet you all in the
[43:11] precious name of our Lord and Savior
[43:13] Jesus Christ, both visible and invisible
[43:16] audience. Amen. Any family members here.
[43:20] God richly bless you and welcome again
[43:23] in our spoken word tabernacle
[43:25] convention. Now we clear with the
[43:28] panoramic view of our purpose. You're
[43:31] talking about the devil attacking me. I
[43:35] say, whoa, there is a purpose behind
[43:37] this. So something is really, really,
[43:40] really working. Now you need, now you
[43:43] understand better why you need to love
[43:44] your enemy.
[43:47] Because they're working for you. The
[43:49] devil is working for you. Your enemy are
[43:52] working for you. Now you need to love
[43:54] your enemy because they actually working
[43:56] for you.
[44:01] Do you see the revelation now? The word
[44:03] is all coming together. When Jesus say
[44:06] love your enemy, you're like,
[44:08] brother Brandham say leave for that man
[44:10] who can kill you. I understand. But now
[44:15] when you begin to understand the bigger
[44:17] picture of what he does, now you begin
[44:20] to say, you know what, you stay on your
[44:22] post duty. Judah, keep doing what you're
[44:24] doing and you will see what Judah did.
[44:28] That without Judah, we will not be
[44:30] standing here. Oh, sorry. Uh, I'm not
[44:33] the one preaching tonight. We will get
[44:35] to that and you'll see the bigger
[44:37] picture of why those things have to be
[44:40] said like that. It's amazing what the
[44:43] scripture is. The message is so
[44:45] beautiful, so great. And it releases all
[44:48] anxiety. Yes, it does. No more worries.
[44:51] Amen. Everything is working together for
[44:55] good. Amen. It's not your battle.
[44:59] That's why the Bible say the battle is
[45:01] who? Because he's the one that started
[45:04] the battle. He's the one that picked
[45:06] Abraham. He's the one that gave Abraham
[45:09] the vision and say your people will be
[45:12] carried out to a strange land. So Israel
[45:15] is just victim of a purpose. So we are
[45:18] victims of purpose. So if we are victim,
[45:22] it's up to him to do what he's supposed
[45:24] to be doing. Amen. Israel cry, cry, cry,
[45:28] cry, cry, pray God left and right, left
[45:30] and right until the season and the time
[45:34] and everything happened and the Lord
[45:36] say, "I have come down because there was
[45:38] a purpose. Everything was lined up
[45:41] completely. So your prayer are staying
[45:43] somewhere." Do you know there is a
[45:44] mystery in the book of Revelation where
[45:46] the prayer of the sand have to be poor?
[45:50] So they were kept somewhere
[45:53] until a certain time. Then the poor the
[45:55] prayer of the saint.
[45:58] So your prayer is not going anywhere.
[46:00] It's staying right there. The timing of
[46:03] answering is what takes a little bit of
[46:06] time depending on the time, the season,
[46:10] and the purpose. If you understand all
[46:12] of these thing, you pray and you move
[46:14] on. Amen. Amen. Oh, blessed be the name
[46:17] of the Lord. You keep praying for me
[46:19] because we keep moving. I'm trying to
[46:20] move up to the surface but I can't.
[46:22] There's so much nugget, jewels, diamond,
[46:26] everything laying down. We just keep
[46:29] taking it, taking it, taking it, taking
[46:31] it. And this word is it's it's I don't
[46:34] know something. If you don't understand
[46:36] the opening of the seals, you got a
[46:39] problem. Amen. If you never understand
[46:42] why do we talk about the seals?
[46:44] Everything that you see here open up in
[46:46] the Bible is because the seals has been
[46:48] broken. If the seals were not broken,
[46:51] every all of these the in between the
[46:54] line you can read the scripture over and
[46:57] over until the seals are broken. Then
[46:59] when you look the one that you love
[47:01] most. Now when you look at that it's
[47:04] telling you something else. It's not
[47:06] really what is written but it's the what
[47:08] is behind what is the log go not the
[47:10] rema the log go behind. Then the
[47:13] scripture changes and when the scripture
[47:15] open up like that he have life because
[47:18] God is talking to somebody. Amen. So I'm
[47:21] not the one preaching tonight. You have
[47:22] a free weekend. Nothing no question and
[47:25] answer and everything. So brother Jar M
[47:28] will be ministering for us tonight.
[47:30] Amen. So you know him better. So he
[47:34] should be getting a little bit
[47:35] comfortable. He's helping with the
[47:37] translation. And now he's a preacher. So
[47:40] praise the Lord. I'm not translating as
[47:42] much as I was. So, we moving forward
[47:46] leader by leader. Everything is
[47:49] getting better just like the building
[47:51] behind. So, keep us in prayer with that
[47:55] building back there. Amen. You pray and
[47:58] you also have your religion with
[48:03] works. Have I say something
[48:06] wrong? You have faith. But faith without
[48:10] work is dead.
[48:12] That's what the Bible says. Amen. If you
[48:15] didn't understand me, you tell me again.
[48:17] If not, I let the trust that that's a
[48:19] message for the trustee. The trustee
[48:21] love works.
[48:24] Amen. Right. Brother said, uh, he want
[48:27] to see the works and then me, I'm going
[48:29] to see the faith. So, you bring the
[48:31] faith and the works together, then the
[48:34] building is moving together for good.
[48:38] Amen. But they're doing a wonderful job
[48:40] beyond even my expectation. If you look
[48:42] outside, I say, "Wow, blessed be the
[48:44] name of the Lord." So do some prayers,
[48:47] some faith, and then some work together
[48:49] and God is able to replenish. Amen.
[48:54] Glory to God. So let's go with only
[48:56] believe as brother Albert, brother Jar
[48:59] comes up. Amen.
[49:02] Home believe
[49:04] [Music]
[49:46] Oh, all
[49:48] [Music]
[50:01] Um, thank you musicians.
[50:05] Thank you musicians. Can you all hear
[50:07] me? Right.
[50:09] God bless you all saints.
[50:12] Um, you can be seated just for a little
[50:14] bit.
[50:16] And I want to thank the pastor for this
[50:18] privilege. It's always a pleasure to
[50:20] come and speak before the bride of
[50:22] Christ. Although it's also always very
[50:25] nerve-wracking, but I thank the Lord
[50:27] God. Anyways,
[50:29] uh I also have like a quick testimony to
[50:31] give. That's why I wanted to give it
[50:34] real quick. Yesterday as I was
[50:35] meditating and preparing what to uh
[50:39] minister today as I was meditating
[50:42] meditating and I got to a point that I
[50:44] was like I have certain school
[50:46] assignments that needs to be due. So I
[50:47] was like let me pause it for a bit then
[50:50] finish certain assignments knock them um
[50:53] before the due dates. So I did that.
[50:55] Then towards the end as I was finishing
[50:57] up the power went out and there was no
[50:59] Wi-Fi or anything so I couldn't continue
[51:01] that. And I was like, I guess God wanted
[51:03] me to take a break. And as when the
[51:05] power went out, I decided to come out. I
[51:07] told my sister that the power was off.
[51:09] And my mom heard me. Then she was like,
[51:10] "Oh, the power went off. Can you do
[51:12] this?" I did what she told me. And my
[51:14] sister, she had errands to run. Then she
[51:17] was like, "Uh, can you drive me?"
[51:19] Because my eyes is like hurting right
[51:22] now. So I was like, "Okay." So as I was
[51:25] getting ready to drive her, she went to
[51:27] the kitchen, started cutting me and
[51:28] watching. I was like, "I thought you
[51:29] wanted me to drive you." She was like,
[51:30] "Oh, I just wanted to take care of this
[51:32] real quick before we go." Then she told
[51:34] me, "Take water. I mean, take a pot,
[51:36] pour water, and put it in the stove."
[51:37] So, as she told me that, I went, I took
[51:39] the water, uh, I took the pot, I pulled
[51:41] water, and I went to the stove. And as I
[51:43] arrived to the stove, I was like, "Why
[51:45] are you telling me to put in the stove?
[51:46] You know, the power is out." Then she
[51:48] was like, "Uh, this was your chance.
[51:49] This was your chance that God was using
[51:51] so he could work on your faith." I was
[51:53] like, "I did have faith." That's how I
[51:55] walked over there without thinking and I
[51:56] placed it over there. And then later on
[51:59] within the same minute I turned around I
[52:01] completely forgot that we didn't have
[52:03] power. So I went to the fridge to try to
[52:05] look for something to uh eat. And as I
[52:08] open it in my mind I was under the
[52:10] expectation that the light would turn
[52:11] on. So the moment I opened it I noticed
[52:13] it was like it wasn't on. All this was
[52:17] happened like within a second. That was
[52:18] like why isn't the light on?
[52:19] Automatically the light turned on. I was
[52:21] like I turned to her I was like see I
[52:23] had faith. Anyways that was like a quick
[52:26] little testimony.
[52:30] Um, if we could all stand,
[52:35] the power came right
[52:52] afterward. Let's go to the Lord in
[52:54] prayer first. Lord heavenly father, I
[52:55] thank you Lord God for protecting us,
[52:57] for watching over us. Thank you Lord
[52:58] heavenly father for watching over us in
[53:00] the howways and byways for bringing us
[53:02] here into your house Lord God. I pray
[53:04] that you may come and take prereminence.
[53:05] May you take control and may be Lord
[53:07] Jesus Christ the starter Lord Jesus
[53:09] Christ of this meeting and may you
[53:11] finish it Lord God. May you take control
[53:12] from the pulpit all the way to the last
[53:15] row and even outside Lord heavenly
[53:16] father. May you take control may you set
[53:18] atmosphere which you already set Lord
[53:20] heavenly father. May stuff happen Lord
[53:21] Jesus Christ because you said when two
[53:22] or three are gathered in your name Lord
[53:24] Jesus Christ something is bound to
[53:25] happen Lord God. Lord heavenly father we
[53:28] pray that you may touch the sick and you
[53:30] heal them. May the word that comes forth
[53:32] Lord heavenly father may those word
[53:33] correct your people may heal your
[53:35] people. May you just take them to higher
[53:37] heights Lord heavenly father. I bend
[53:39] everything unto your saying in Jesus
[53:41] Christ's name I pray. Amen. Amen.
[53:45] As you're standing, if we could go to
[53:47] [Music]
[53:49] um our reading today in Exodus chapter
[53:57] 17, if you're there, can you say amen?
[54:01] Exodus chapter 17 verse 8
[54:09] to9. The scripture says
[54:12] this. Then came Amalecch and fought with
[54:16] the Israel in Refodm. And Moses said
[54:19] unto Joshua, "Choose us out men and go
[54:22] out fight with
[54:24] Amalecch. Tomorrow I will stand on the
[54:28] top of the hill with the rod of God in
[54:30] my hand." You may be
[54:32] seated. And if we could drop to verse
[54:36] um we could drop to verse
[54:46] 11 And it came to pass that Moses held
[54:49] up his hand, and Israel prevailed. And
[54:52] when he let down his hand, Amalcch
[54:54] prevailed. But Moses had But Moses'
[54:58] hands were heavy. And they took stone
[55:00] and put it under him. And he sat there
[55:03] on. And Aaron and hers stayed up his
[55:06] hands. and the one on the one side and
[55:08] the other on the other side. And his
[55:10] hands were steady until the going down
[55:13] of the sun. And Joshua discomfort
[55:16] discomforted Amalcch and his people with
[55:19] the edge of the
[55:20] sword. And in verse 16, it says, "For
[55:23] they said, because the Lord has sworn
[55:26] that the Lord will have war with
[55:29] Amalecch from generation to generation."
[55:35] And if we could go to Exodus, I want to
[55:38] get to the scripture. Get the scriptures
[55:40] down first. Exodus 15 verse 3. It says
[55:44] this, "The Lord is a man of war," which
[55:46] we found out last time. The Lord is a
[55:49] man of war. The Lord is his name. And we
[55:51] were trying to find out what God does in
[55:53] war. What God is doing in our journey as
[55:55] we're going through last time. And in
[55:58] verse 13, the Bible says, "Thou in thy
[56:02] mercy has led forth the people which
[56:04] thou has redeemed. Thou has guided them
[56:07] in thy strength unto thy holy
[56:09] habitation." Because God was the person
[56:11] who purchased us. He's the one who
[56:12] redeemed us. He bought the map and after
[56:14] he's g he's uh leading us to the um to
[56:18] our habitation to our destination.
[56:22] And 16:17 says, "Fear the dread shall
[56:25] fear and dread shall fall upon them. Thy
[56:28] greatness and thy arm they shall be
[56:32] there shall be as still as stone till
[56:34] thy people pass over, oh Lord, till the
[56:36] people pass over which thou has
[56:38] purchased.
[56:40] Thou shalt bring men in, and plant them
[56:43] in the mountain of thy inheritance, in
[56:45] the place, O Lord, which thou has made
[56:48] for thee to dwell in, in the sanctuary,
[56:52] O Lord, which thy hands have
[56:53] established. We found out that God who
[56:56] purchased us in Calvary. He bled for us.
[56:59] And then he didn't stop there. He went,
[57:01] he prepared a house for us. And he's
[57:03] leading us to that house that is not
[57:06] created or built by the hands of men.
[57:08] Amen. And my subject for this night
[57:12] is arise soldiers of the cross, God's
[57:16] preparation.
[57:18] And I'd actually want to go to the
[57:20] scripture which gave me that inspiration
[57:23] which is in Amos chapter
[57:31] 4. Amos chapter 4 verse 9. If you're
[57:34] there, can you say amen?
[57:39] That was a few amens. If you're there,
[57:40] can you say amen? Amen. Glory be to God.
[57:44] Amos 4 verse
[57:48] 9. The scripture says this. I have
[57:52] smitten you with blasting and mildew.
[57:55] When your gardens and your vineards and
[57:58] your vineyards and your fig trees and
[57:59] your olive trees increased, the
[58:02] Palmerworm devoured them. Yet have ye
[58:05] not returned unto me, says the Lord.
[58:08] See, there are certain trials that we
[58:09] come across that we think that it's the
[58:12] devil, but it's Lord God who's doing
[58:13] that to bring us back to himself. You
[58:15] see, and he continues and he says verse
[58:18] 10, I have sent among you the pestilence
[58:22] after manner of Egypt. Your young men
[58:24] have I slain with the sword and have
[58:27] taken away your horses. And I have
[58:30] made and I have made the stink of your
[58:33] camp to come up unto your nostril. Yet
[58:36] have ye not returned unto me, says the
[58:39] Lord. I have overthrown some of you as
[58:42] God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah. I love
[58:44] that part where he say I have thrown
[58:46] because God is talking say I have thrown
[58:48] first person that he says as God. It's
[58:50] almost like he's he switched it to third
[58:52] person which a lot of people um get lost
[58:55] in that that they start building
[58:57] doctrines of trinity and multiple gods
[58:59] based on that and they fail to catch the
[59:01] fact that God when he speaks he will
[59:04] speak from a first person point of view
[59:06] and sometime he will switch it to third
[59:07] person point of view and people tend to
[59:09] mistaken that switch into its two
[59:12] different people as if he's talking
[59:14] about someone else but he's talking
[59:15] about himself in a third perspective
[59:18] and the scripture continues It says, "Ye
[59:20] were as a fire brand plucked out of the
[59:24] burning, yet have ye not returned unto
[59:27] me, sayith the Lord." See, God is
[59:29] continuously keeping tribes to bring you
[59:31] back to him. But s uh the Israelite
[59:34] children weren't listening. Verse 12,
[59:36] therefore thou will I do unto thee, O
[59:40] Israel, and because I will do this unto
[59:43] thee, prepare to meet thy God, O Israel.
[59:46] When I read that scripture, he say
[59:48] prepare to meet thy God, O Israel. And I
[59:50] was thinking about I was like there's
[59:51] two type of preparation. Either God
[59:53] could prepare you or you could prepare
[59:55] yourself. And the thing about it,
[59:57] there's also when God prepares you,
[59:59] there could be a good preparation and a
[1:00:00] bad preparation. And when you prepare
[1:00:02] yourself, there could be also a good
[1:00:03] preparation and a bad preparation. You
[1:00:05] see, because if you take the story of uh
[1:00:07] Esther for example, the king had called
[1:00:10] people to come in and after that the
[1:00:12] king gave a command and he said uh go uh
[1:00:16] he he sent them to uh Hagar so they can
[1:00:19] you know dress themselves so they can go
[1:00:21] meet the king and Hagar was like go over
[1:00:23] there and dress yourself. He gave them
[1:00:24] an order to go prepare themselves and a
[1:00:27] lot of people went and that they started
[1:00:28] dressing themselves. Brother Brandham
[1:00:29] say humans their first instinct is to go
[1:00:31] dress themselves. They want to cover
[1:00:33] themselves up and the first thing the
[1:00:36] other people did was cover themsel. You
[1:00:38] see, they started preparing themselves
[1:00:39] and they started preparing themselves
[1:00:41] based on what they thought was right.
[1:00:43] Some of them probably prepared
[1:00:44] themselves in a manner that said if I
[1:00:46] prepare myself like this, maybe I could
[1:00:48] seduce the king to choose me. Others
[1:00:50] were like maybe if I wear this way,
[1:00:52] maybe this is the the uh the correct
[1:00:55] stature or the correct standard of
[1:00:56] modesty with based on their own
[1:00:59] understanding. But when it came to
[1:01:00] Esther, she relied herself on the
[1:01:03] Chamberlain. And the Chamberlain told
[1:01:05] her how to dress. And the thing is uh
[1:01:08] what's it called? Everything that the
[1:01:10] Chamberlain told her how to dress. It
[1:01:12] wasn't really the Chamberlain dressing
[1:01:13] her, but it was the king dressing Esther
[1:01:16] through the ch the Chamberlain. You see,
[1:01:18] for example, if you were to come, let's
[1:01:20] say, um you were come to meet me and
[1:01:23] that you wanted to give me something
[1:01:25] that would be uh that would make me
[1:01:26] happy. You see, you would have to go to
[1:01:28] my siblings and have to ask them what I
[1:01:30] like. And they would tell you what I
[1:01:32] like and they would tell you how to make
[1:01:34] it how I like it so you can please me.
[1:01:36] And it's not them who's preparing you so
[1:01:38] you can bring something to please me.
[1:01:40] But it's my preference, my thoughts in
[1:01:43] them that's preparing you to come meet
[1:01:45] me and so you can um please me.
[1:01:48] [Music]
[1:01:50] And if we could go to
[1:01:52] um
[1:02:05] Colossians, Chapter on
[1:02:18] if you're there. Can you say amen? Amen.
[1:02:20] Colossians chapter 1 verse 12.
[1:02:24] Colossians chapter 1:12. The scripture
[1:02:27] says this, "Give thanks unto the father
[1:02:30] which have made us meat to the part to
[1:02:34] be partaker of the inheritance of the
[1:02:36] saints in light who have delivered us
[1:02:40] from the power of darkness." See, it's
[1:02:42] God who's delivering us. It's God's
[1:02:44] role. And hath translated us on into the
[1:02:48] kingdom of his dear son. You see,
[1:02:53] and in whom we have redemption through
[1:02:57] his blood. It's not out of our own work,
[1:03:00] but it's through the blood of Christ.
[1:03:01] It's through God himself. God God is the
[1:03:03] one who's doing all these things
[1:03:06] through through his blood even the
[1:03:08] forgiveness of sins. Who who is in the
[1:03:11] image of the invisible God, the
[1:03:13] firstborn of every creature. For by him
[1:03:16] were all things created that are in
[1:03:20] heaven and that are in earth, visible
[1:03:22] and invisible, whether they be thrones
[1:03:25] or dominion or principalities or powers.
[1:03:28] All these things were created by him and
[1:03:30] for him. See, he say it was created by
[1:03:32] him. And what was the purpose for it to
[1:03:34] be created? It was created for him. You
[1:03:36] see and it continues says and it and he
[1:03:39] is before all men and by him all things
[1:03:42] consist. See God as we learning about
[1:03:45] our purpose and stuff like that. God
[1:03:46] created everything and the purpose for
[1:03:48] him creating it is for him. And we found
[1:03:51] out last Sunday that we are the purpose
[1:03:52] of God. So if we're the purpose of God,
[1:03:55] why did God create us? He created us for
[1:03:57] him. And it says that everything is
[1:03:58] consist of him. That mean he's in
[1:04:00] control of everything. That mean it's up
[1:04:02] to him to prepare us. It's not up to us
[1:04:03] to really prepare oursel. You see, and
[1:04:08] if we go to uh 57, stand still and see
[1:04:11] the salvation of the Lord. Paragraph 29,
[1:04:14] Brother Brand
[1:04:16] says, "It's not your battle. Just stand
[1:04:19] still. It's God's battle. Don't be
[1:04:21] flustered. Don't be upset. Stand still.
[1:04:24] We're living in a tremendous time. We're
[1:04:26] living in a great time." See, we're
[1:04:28] living in a tremendous time. It could be
[1:04:29] bad. We're living in a great time. It
[1:04:31] could be good depending on which side
[1:04:32] you stand. You see, the church should
[1:04:35] stand still now to receive the promises.
[1:04:38] Stand still and watch the glory of God.
[1:04:41] He's not the I was, he's the I am. He's
[1:04:44] the same. We're will just stand still as
[1:04:47] they did. The I am the same I am lives
[1:04:50] tonight. As we spoke, if those that um
[1:04:55] for those of us that either, you know,
[1:04:57] watch military stuff or documents or
[1:04:59] movies or whatever, I took RTC. Usually
[1:05:01] when a commander is ready to give an
[1:05:04] order, he you he will tell you to stand
[1:05:06] at ease, he will call you to attention
[1:05:08] that he tells you to stand at ease so he
[1:05:09] can give out a command to give out uh
[1:05:11] the commandment. And usually those
[1:05:13] commandment it will give you it's like a
[1:05:15] rubric or it's a plan of what either
[1:05:18] it's going to happen before the war or
[1:05:20] throughout the day. It's a plan and he's
[1:05:22] supposed to mentally prepare you for
[1:05:24] what's going to happen. See that mean
[1:05:26] the commander is mentally preparing you
[1:05:28] for what's to come.
[1:05:30] And the prophet says um in the water of
[1:05:33] separation 55 he says paragraph 11 now
[1:05:36] the separation Christ was the lamb of
[1:05:39] God slain from the foundation of the
[1:05:41] world. You believe it notice always he
[1:05:44] was the lamb slain figuratively God gave
[1:05:48] many. We've been taking this week many
[1:05:51] times where God made a figure speaking
[1:05:54] of Calvary. So this time when he God
[1:05:58] bringing his children out of the chaos
[1:06:00] see God who's bringing them out of the
[1:06:02] chaos of darkness of Egypt which Egypt
[1:06:05] represent the world he brought them out
[1:06:07] to take them to his promised land and on
[1:06:10] the road he was making preparations for
[1:06:13] everything that that they had need of.
[1:06:16] When they had need of something God had
[1:06:19] a preparation you see he had a
[1:06:21] preparation of it every single time God
[1:06:23] is walking. Every single time God plans
[1:06:25] something, he's the one who's making um
[1:06:28] preparation for it. If he tells you to
[1:06:29] go somewhere, that mean he already has
[1:06:31] everything pre-planned through his
[1:06:33] foreign knowledge. He already
[1:06:34] pre-planned everything. That mean you
[1:06:36] have nothing to worry about. Just rely
[1:06:38] upon him. And that's what faith is.
[1:06:41] Amen. And it continues in preparation.
[1:06:44] It says paragraph 88, now another thing.
[1:06:47] Well, now by my boy, I believe you're to
[1:06:51] become a minister. We will see the
[1:06:54] doctor and elder and all them and we'll
[1:06:57] give you the right hand of fellowship.
[1:06:59] We'll send you off to a seminary and
[1:07:02] we'll teach you all about this thing.
[1:07:05] Never that. No sir. That wasn't God's
[1:07:07] preparation. Over here, brother Brennham
[1:07:08] is talking about let's say um certain
[1:07:11] what people do would they would take a
[1:07:13] they would take let's see they see um a
[1:07:16] child and that they think a child has a
[1:07:18] gift in them. They would take them and
[1:07:19] they would take it upon themsel to start
[1:07:21] preparing that child. And brother
[1:07:23] Brandham said, "It's not up to you to
[1:07:24] prepare it." They would put them in
[1:07:26] seminaries to to uh train them. And when
[1:07:28] they do good, they're like, "You did
[1:07:30] good. Now you're getting somewhere."
[1:07:31] That they that's how they end up giving
[1:07:33] people fake Holy Ghost. You see, by prep
[1:07:35] by their own personal preparation, then
[1:07:37] they're going to start deming them that
[1:07:39] you have the Holy Ghost. But in reality,
[1:07:40] they do not. And brother Brandon said,
[1:07:42] "That's not how um that's not God's
[1:07:44] preparation."
[1:07:46] He said, "Wait in the city of Jerusalem
[1:07:48] until you're endued with the power from
[1:07:51] on high." And when the day of Pentecost
[1:07:54] is fully come, now Brother Bren is going
[1:07:56] to talk about how God prepares. He says,
[1:07:58] "But suddenly there came a sound from
[1:08:02] heaven like a rushing mighty wind. It
[1:08:04] filled all the house where they were
[1:08:07] setting." Hallelujah. Clothing tongue
[1:08:10] set upon them like fire. They were
[1:08:13] filled with the Holy Ghost. out into the
[1:08:15] streets and across the nation. Signs and
[1:08:18] wonders. They laid in the shadow of men
[1:08:20] and were healed. The critics made fun of
[1:08:23] them. You see those the Holy Ghost
[1:08:25] manifestation. That's God preparing his
[1:08:27] people. That was God's preparation. God
[1:08:31] hasn't changed his plan. That was that
[1:08:34] was to be until Jesus come back again.
[1:08:38] It sounds ridiculous to an ordinary man.
[1:08:40] You see it says all those signs of
[1:08:43] wonder is supposed to happen even in
[1:08:44] today till God comes again. You see it
[1:08:47] shouldn't have stopped just because at
[1:08:48] the 50s or um because of the day of the
[1:08:51] Pentecost and people say oh it's done
[1:08:53] then no it continues on throughout the
[1:08:55] ages and it says it sounds ridiculous to
[1:08:58] an ordinary man because God's thought
[1:08:59] the scripture say God's thoughts is
[1:09:00] higher than ours. We we are incapable of
[1:09:03] comprehending what God had planned.
[1:09:05] Amen. Because who would have thought
[1:09:07] Joseph going through uh what's it
[1:09:08] called? Joseph being sold would have
[1:09:11] brought him to be in a higher position.
[1:09:13] Us human, we couldn't have thought of
[1:09:14] that. You see, we would have found it
[1:09:16] strange. We would have been like, why
[1:09:17] did he do this? Why didn't uh what's it
[1:09:19] called? The
[1:09:21] um the the king's servant, Pharaoh's
[1:09:25] servant, why didn't he remember Joseph?
[1:09:26] Because if he would remember Joseph,
[1:09:28] maybe uh one the the dream wasn't there.
[1:09:31] So there wasn't any dream to uh what to
[1:09:33] call validate Joseph. So our thoughts
[1:09:36] limits us compared to God. You see?
[1:09:41] And brother Brandon continues in
[1:09:42] preparation paragraph 9. He says it's
[1:09:44] God's preparation time. God's preparing
[1:09:46] a people. And I believe tonight it's
[1:09:48] God's preparation time. And God is
[1:09:50] preparing a certain people through the
[1:09:52] preaching of his word. Amen. All you've
[1:09:55] got All you got faith have got faith.
[1:09:58] Raise your hands. Say, "I've got faith,
[1:10:00] brother Brandham. I believe it." But
[1:10:02] brother Brandon was not here. So you can
[1:10:04] say I have faith brother DM I believe
[1:10:06] it. You believe it's the preparation
[1:10:08] time. Don't notice your age. Don't
[1:10:11] notice your circumstance. Faith knows no
[1:10:14] age limit or circumstance. Faith knows
[1:10:17] one thing. God said so and that settles
[1:10:19] it. You see over here God faith you see
[1:10:22] God is the one who's preparing
[1:10:24] everything. And over here it says that
[1:10:26] faith has no age. I remember a a beloved
[1:10:29] asked me how do I prepare for my uh
[1:10:30] what's it called? For my sermons. They
[1:10:33] asked me, "How do you prepare? Is it
[1:10:34] when the pastor calls you and then after
[1:10:36] that you start looking and trying to
[1:10:38] align your stuff with uh what's being
[1:10:40] ministered?" I was like, "No." Usually
[1:10:42] how I prepare my stuff, I prepare it
[1:10:44] before I'm even called. As I'm walking,
[1:10:46] as I'm living, as I'm um studying the
[1:10:49] scripture, a thought will come and when
[1:10:51] the thought will come, I will take out
[1:10:52] my phone. I will put on my notes. And as
[1:10:54] I'm living my life, as I'm listening to
[1:10:56] the word, as I'm going to church and the
[1:10:58] word is being preached, what all all it
[1:11:00] does is God is giving me little uh notes
[1:11:03] and nuggets to add into my notes. And I
[1:11:05] and I start adding a little by little. I
[1:11:07] remember when I was um a little bit
[1:11:09] younger, a u believer had told me that a
[1:11:13] preacher should always have a material,
[1:11:15] should always have something to minister
[1:11:18] to a believer. And something within me
[1:11:20] was saying he's 100% correct. And that
[1:11:22] that same something was also telling me
[1:11:24] that it's not just for ministers. It's
[1:11:27] every believer should always have a
[1:11:29] material to minister to another
[1:11:30] believer. It doesn't matter if you're a
[1:11:32] child or you're old. At the time when I
[1:11:34] was young, I was like, well, I'm not a
[1:11:36] preacher, so let me just, you know, live
[1:11:38] that. I didn't think about that at the
[1:11:39] time. But every over here says faith has
[1:11:42] no age. See, if I had caught that
[1:11:45] revelation, I would have prepared it
[1:11:46] since then. That mean even you Elijah,
[1:11:48] you can start preparing right now. You
[1:11:50] can minister to your friends. You see,
[1:11:52] faith has no age. That's right.
[1:11:54] And brother Brandon continues in Elijah
[1:11:57] 53 paragraph 47 says and said it's not
[1:12:01] going to even be due fall from heaven
[1:12:04] till I call for it. Well, I imagine the
[1:12:06] king said, "Well, who are you?" But he
[1:12:09] knowed what he was talking about. He
[1:12:12] know the word of the Lord. That's the
[1:12:14] reason ministers today and everything
[1:12:17] keep telling you to prepare to meet God
[1:12:20] because they know the word of the Lord
[1:12:22] and know these are warnings everywhere.
[1:12:25] You see that's why ministers are telling
[1:12:27] you to prepare to meet God. And how do
[1:12:28] you prepare to meet God? You prepare to
[1:12:30] meet God by reading your Bible. But you
[1:12:31] prepare to meet God by reading the
[1:12:32] message of the hour. You prepare to meet
[1:12:35] God. When minister comes and start
[1:12:36] ministering, they will tell you to take
[1:12:38] this off, to take this off, to put this
[1:12:39] on. All of those are are preparation.
[1:12:42] They're preparation. That's God is the
[1:12:44] one who's preparing you through your
[1:12:46] pastor. God is preparing you to your
[1:12:48] pastor. So if you're forsaking them,
[1:12:49] you're forsaking God. And it says famine
[1:12:53] and pasteland and earthquake and so
[1:12:55] forth. He said all these things, all
[1:12:58] these are the beginning of sorrow. Then
[1:13:01] they shall deliver you up and you shall
[1:13:03] be hated of all the nation for my name's
[1:13:06] sake. See, God is preparing because
[1:13:09] there's a great famine that's happening.
[1:13:11] And there's a great there's a greater
[1:13:12] famine that's coming and God is
[1:13:14] preparing you for that. And if you don't
[1:13:16] have the right preparation for it, you
[1:13:18] will find yourself in the wrong side.
[1:13:20] Remember I said there's God's
[1:13:21] preparation, there's our preparation.
[1:13:22] And there's good and bad in each in each
[1:13:24] side. When God is preparing his
[1:13:26] children, he prepares them right. And
[1:13:29] his thoughts are he prepares them with
[1:13:31] an expected end, a good thought. You
[1:13:33] see, he prepares you with good
[1:13:35] intentions. But let's say if it's the um
[1:13:38] the child of the devil, he gives you
[1:13:40] free will. That free will is the devil
[1:13:42] who's going to use it to prepare you for
[1:13:44] a uh what's it called? For a condition
[1:13:47] that's for a condition ready to uh for
[1:13:49] destruction because brother Brandham
[1:13:51] said that the world before anything
[1:13:54] happens. They have to be in the
[1:13:55] atmosphere in the condition for for that
[1:13:57] thing to happen. So if the world seems
[1:14:00] like everything is in chaos, I mean
[1:14:02] they're preparing themselves for the
[1:14:03] tribulation. God is let is letting the
[1:14:05] devil roam free to prepare the people of
[1:14:08] this world for the tribulation. And God
[1:14:10] is also letting his spirit roam free in
[1:14:13] the church to prepare his bride, his
[1:14:15] children for the rapture.
[1:14:19] And brother Brand saying, "Believe thou
[1:14:21] paragraph 31. But just before his birth,
[1:14:26] God always makes a preparation for
[1:14:28] things." Don't you believe? Don't you
[1:14:31] believe that? I want you to listen
[1:14:33] close. I believe today with all my
[1:14:37] heart. Now, this is just Brother
[1:14:39] Brandham speaking. See, a lot of people
[1:14:40] when they says this is just Brother
[1:14:42] Brandon speaking, they're thinking,
[1:14:43] "Well, it's just the prophet's opinion,
[1:14:44] so I shouldn't take that." You because
[1:14:47] uh what's it called? Paul had an opinion
[1:14:49] he put in the Bible and that it was
[1:14:51] written. You see, because I was reading
[1:14:53] the um I was reading Paul when he was
[1:14:55] speaking about he was basically speaking
[1:14:57] about marriage and divorce and I think
[1:14:58] he was like I I prefer if any also
[1:15:02] you're going through trials and
[1:15:03] everything. I would prefer for you to
[1:15:05] not u divorce and he said it was his
[1:15:08] opinion and when I looked at it I went
[1:15:10] back to Genesis and I looked when Adam
[1:15:12] and Eve they went through a trial um the
[1:15:15] scripture says Adam was not deceived. He
[1:15:18] willingly sinned. That mean he chose
[1:15:20] when Eve when they were going through
[1:15:22] trials instead of forsaking his wife he
[1:15:24] chose his wife. Even when God came he
[1:15:26] chose his wife. He said that's the one
[1:15:28] that you gave me. He chose he identified
[1:15:30] himself with his wife. You see? And when
[1:15:33] I read that and when I remembered I was
[1:15:35] like Paul was taking his inspiration
[1:15:39] from Genesis. So when he gave his
[1:15:42] opinion it wasn't really his opin his
[1:15:43] his opinion. It was inspired by the
[1:15:45] story in Genesis. So when brother
[1:15:47] Brandham says it's brother Brandham
[1:15:49] speaking and I believe because a lot of
[1:15:51] people use the term I believe or I think
[1:15:53] as a filler word but in reality that's
[1:15:55] not it's not really oh I think but it's
[1:15:57] actually something that they they're
[1:15:59] saying and God over here is talking and
[1:16:01] also brother Brandon saying I believe
[1:16:03] it's not brother Brandon speaking but
[1:16:04] it's God through brother Brandham he
[1:16:06] says I believe that the things that you
[1:16:08] see are taking place now is a
[1:16:11] preparation.
[1:16:13] God is preparing something just before a
[1:16:16] climax. God always warns the world and
[1:16:20] then if they won't will not receive the
[1:16:23] warning, then there's only one thing
[1:16:25] left, which is judgment. Because a lot
[1:16:27] of people ask, well, why are so and so
[1:16:30] judging me? Did you listen to the
[1:16:31] warning that they gave you? A lot of
[1:16:32] people saying, well, God is a bad God.
[1:16:34] Oh, there why is he judging people and
[1:16:36] sending people to the lake fire and all
[1:16:37] that? Did you listen to the preparation
[1:16:39] that he made? Did you listen to the
[1:16:40] warnings that he g he made? Because even
[1:16:43] um in the story of um Abel and Cain, God
[1:16:46] came to Cain, the enemies at the door.
[1:16:49] He warned Cain. He gave him a warning.
[1:16:52] So don't be surprised when God don't be
[1:16:55] surprised when you see the mark of the
[1:16:56] beast on you because God gave you a
[1:16:58] warning to prevent you from having the
[1:17:00] mark of the beast. But you're the one
[1:17:02] who's not listening. That's the big
[1:17:03] difference. The issue is not God, but
[1:17:05] the issue is you as an individual not
[1:17:08] listening to God's preparation.
[1:17:11] Now, the prophet continues says, "Noah
[1:17:13] warned the world, and they would not
[1:17:16] receive it. And all through the ages,
[1:17:19] God's always warned. God always warns.
[1:17:23] He sends mercy. And if there's per
[1:17:26] mercy, if there's per mercy, there's
[1:17:29] nothing else left but judgment. Because
[1:17:31] if you remove mercy, nothing else is
[1:17:33] left but judgment. But then the merciful
[1:17:35] father will send you mercy first. Isn't
[1:17:38] that just a beautiful picture of love?
[1:17:40] Paragraph 34 says, "God has always had
[1:17:44] angels, ministering spirits." Because
[1:17:47] the prophet said throughout the church
[1:17:48] ages, Christ, the spirit of Christ is
[1:17:50] going through the church ages picking
[1:17:52] his bride, picking his bride, picking
[1:17:54] his witnesses, preparing his bride. You
[1:17:57] see? Amen. Do you believe it? Angels
[1:18:00] don't die. What was what was happening?
[1:18:03] God was just fixing to do something on
[1:18:06] earth. So before he always does
[1:18:08] something, he sent an announcement.
[1:18:11] Remember it said stand still and receive
[1:18:13] your promises. Before God always does
[1:18:15] anything, he sends his announcement. He
[1:18:17] will tell you to stand still and listen
[1:18:19] to what he's saying. And that when he's
[1:18:21] telling you to stand still and listen to
[1:18:24] your promises, that's God giving his
[1:18:25] announcement to you. You see, and you
[1:18:27] need to listen to that. Amen. Amen. And
[1:18:30] in preparation in 21, paragraph 21,
[1:18:33] brother Brandon says, "Now God in the
[1:18:36] beginning when Adam and Eve, man was
[1:18:40] always man has always tried to prepare
[1:18:43] himself like like uh what's it called?
[1:18:45] The womens that were selected
[1:18:48] for in the time of Esther, they were
[1:18:51] preparing themselves. They told him they
[1:18:53] brought him to the location. They saw
[1:18:54] everything that was there. That's why it
[1:18:55] was nice and they automatically started
[1:18:57] preparing themselves. See, it's like a
[1:18:59] default mechanism for humans to always
[1:19:01] prepare themsel.
[1:19:03] Oh yes sir. He tries to prepare himself.
[1:19:06] When he first s in the beginning, the
[1:19:09] first thing you know he went out and
[1:19:11] prepared himself an apron fig leaves
[1:19:14] prepared it around him. He's making
[1:19:16] himself. Now the word religion means
[1:19:19] covering. And Adam and Eve made
[1:19:21] themselves a religion, a covering. But
[1:19:23] when God called them and they had to
[1:19:26] stand face to face with God, they
[1:19:28] realized that their man-made religion
[1:19:32] wasn't good enough, they realized that
[1:19:33] their man-made preparation wasn't good
[1:19:36] enough. Because many came in front of
[1:19:38] Jesus say, "Well, Jesus, we prophesied
[1:19:39] in your name and everything." And Jesus
[1:19:40] say, "I never knew you." Because they
[1:19:42] thought they were righteous by their own
[1:19:45] righteousness. They thought they were
[1:19:47] prepared. They thought they were ready
[1:19:48] by their own preparations. You see? And
[1:19:51] it says, "And if you're anything short
[1:19:54] of the Holy Spirit and death strikes
[1:19:57] your body, you'll find out that man-made
[1:20:01] religion won't stand in the time of
[1:20:03] death."
[1:20:05] Just like the uh the rich young ruler
[1:20:08] when he had died, he found himself in
[1:20:10] hell. At that day, he started pleading
[1:20:11] say, "Oh, can you send uh Lazarus? Can
[1:20:13] you send someone over there? Can you
[1:20:15] send someone? If if my family could just
[1:20:18] see someone rise from the dead, they
[1:20:20] would believe." and stuff like that. And
[1:20:22] in nowadays, like that's the scripture
[1:20:24] that say if they see someone rise from
[1:20:26] the dead, they will believe. How about
[1:20:27] today? Exactly. Jesus Christ rise from
[1:20:29] the dead. And there's many that don't
[1:20:30] believe.
[1:20:33] And the prophet continues. He says it it
[1:20:36] will tell when you get down at the be at
[1:20:39] at the end of the road. So the best
[1:20:42] thing to do is make preparation for it
[1:20:45] right now. He didn't say make it later
[1:20:46] on. He said make it right now.
[1:20:50] Get the things straightened up. Get
[1:20:52] right with God. Get right with God right
[1:20:54] now. And you get right with God by the
[1:20:56] preaching of the word, by listening the
[1:20:58] word. And the prophet says, "Now notice
[1:21:01] if wrap herself up in some figs and
[1:21:05] Adam." See, I like the part where it
[1:21:07] says and Adam because a lot of people
[1:21:08] like to put pressures on the sisters and
[1:21:10] they tend to forget the brothers. A lot
[1:21:13] see me growing up in the message, they
[1:21:15] always say, "Oh, brothers, listen to the
[1:21:16] message. Listen to the message. Listen
[1:21:18] to the tape." And they don't really
[1:21:19] enforce it on the sisters. And when they
[1:21:21] don't enforce it on the sisters, when
[1:21:22] the sister grow up and that the sister
[1:21:24] is not dressing well based on the word
[1:21:27] that they start blaming the sister and
[1:21:29] putting pressure on the sister. You see,
[1:21:31] how are you going to put pressure on the
[1:21:32] sister when you did not enforce them and
[1:21:34] you did not tell them to stay with the
[1:21:36] word against their youth? You see the
[1:21:39] same thing with um the same thing with
[1:21:42] Eve. How are you going to how are you
[1:21:44] going to blame Eve for uh what's it
[1:21:46] called? going and taking bite of the
[1:21:48] apple. She was just a little kid taking
[1:21:50] bite of the uh the fruit the the tree of
[1:21:53] knowledge and evil. How can you blame
[1:21:56] Eve? She was young. She was just it was
[1:21:58] Adam's responsibility to take care of
[1:22:00] her. It was Adam's responsibility to
[1:22:02] prepare her. You see, so you can't just
[1:22:05] keep forcing because brother Brand said
[1:22:07] that the responsibility of the children
[1:22:09] is is on the mother. The mother will
[1:22:11] take accountability for it. So the
[1:22:12] mother is supposed to train the children
[1:22:14] in the ways of the Lord. They're
[1:22:16] supposed to train them. And when they
[1:22:17] train the children, they're not telling
[1:22:19] the mother to train only the boys, but
[1:22:21] also to train the children. That mean
[1:22:23] male and female. You train both of them
[1:22:24] in the in the fear of the Lord. And
[1:22:28] and the thing is,
[1:22:31] since the uh husband is the head, that
[1:22:34] mean if the mother is not doing
[1:22:35] something right,
[1:22:37] her uh failure will fall upon you.
[1:22:40] Because God came and said Adam. He
[1:22:42] didn't say Eve. He went to Adam. That
[1:22:44] mean the the head is supposed to be in
[1:22:46] charge to keeping the wife in check and
[1:22:48] the wife is supposed to keep the
[1:22:49] children in check. It's a whole
[1:22:51] hierarchy and it's a whole order.
[1:22:55] And the prophet says, "But when it come
[1:22:59] time for the face of um to face God,
[1:23:02] they prepare they were um condemned.
[1:23:05] They realized that they realized that
[1:23:08] that man-made religion wouldn't work."
[1:23:10] Right? So when God called them now how
[1:23:15] true it is today when God was when God
[1:23:18] had prepared himself to speak to Adam
[1:23:21] and Adam in in a man-made way was trying
[1:23:25] to prepare himself to speak to God.
[1:23:29] But God had to prepare Adam to speak to
[1:23:33] him. See God right now is preparing a
[1:23:36] bride to speak to him. God right now is
[1:23:38] preparing a bride to come and commune,
[1:23:41] have fellowship with him. You see, it's
[1:23:44] not us preparing oursel, but it's God
[1:23:46] who's preparing us through the word. God
[1:23:48] is preparing us through the messenger,
[1:23:49] through your local pastors also. He's
[1:23:51] also preparing us through your own um
[1:23:53] parents and your peers
[1:23:56] and it continued. So in order to do
[1:23:58] that, they began to pass the bucket one
[1:24:01] to another once in the old street
[1:24:04] expression say, "Oh, it wasn't me. It
[1:24:06] was so and so." And then what happened?
[1:24:09] God went out and got some skins and made
[1:24:12] them aprons. See, God didn't even listen
[1:24:14] to them blaming each other. It's kind of
[1:24:16] like uh the prodigal son where he came
[1:24:17] and that he start blaming himself. He
[1:24:19] was like, "I did this and this." And the
[1:24:20] father wasn't listening to them. That's
[1:24:22] right. And the father wasn't listening
[1:24:23] to them. That's right. And since the
[1:24:26] father the father wasn't listening to
[1:24:27] what uh what's it called the prodigal
[1:24:29] son was saying and I think he
[1:24:30] automatically start preparing
[1:24:32] everything. He start started preparing
[1:24:34] um uh calling the servants and
[1:24:36] everything to wash him kind of like kind
[1:24:39] of like uh what's it called in this age
[1:24:40] God prepared a servant to come and speak
[1:24:42] to to the word and by the preaching of
[1:24:44] the word you're being washed and you're
[1:24:46] being prepared to come into your
[1:24:47] position. That's right.
[1:24:50] And the prophet continues and says,
[1:24:53] "Then when I can hear going down along
[1:24:57] that path through the Garden of Eden,
[1:24:59] something like this," Brother Brand
[1:25:01] claps, "what is it? Bloody ship slapping
[1:25:06] on Adam's leg as he went down. Then I
[1:25:09] could see all the great spaceless
[1:25:12] eternity come forming down like a funnel
[1:25:15] to four letter um to four letter letter
[1:25:18] L O V E. He loved his children so much
[1:25:21] till he couldn't turn them away. See
[1:25:24] that is just love because God didn't
[1:25:26] have to do it but he did it. He wasn't
[1:25:28] obligated to do it but he chose to do
[1:25:30] it. Why? Because he loved you. That the
[1:25:32] the purpose why he even said that his
[1:25:34] thoughts for you it's of an expected
[1:25:37] end. It's of something good. It's good.
[1:25:39] Why? Because he loves you. You You're
[1:25:41] not going to have uh what's it called?
[1:25:42] You're not going to prepare something
[1:25:43] evil for someone that you love. You see,
[1:25:46] you make sure everything that you
[1:25:47] prepare it sweet and lovely.
[1:25:51] And the prophet continues says, "Then I
[1:25:53] hear him say, "Stop. I'll put immity
[1:25:56] between thy seed and the serpent seed,
[1:25:59] promising a redeemer." God making
[1:26:01] preparation to redeem. You see when when
[1:26:04] humanity had fallen because of sin, God
[1:26:07] had already prepared a remedy. God had
[1:26:09] already prepared a solution. You see?
[1:26:13] And the prophet goes, "What is it?"
[1:26:15] God's prepared lamb from the foundation
[1:26:18] of the world, going yonder to die for
[1:26:21] sinners like you and me. God making
[1:26:24] ready a preparation. God preparation
[1:26:27] that would cleanse the heart of sinful
[1:26:31] men and redeem him back to himself. It's
[1:26:34] God who's redeeming. God preparing,
[1:26:37] getting ready. No, no other way could um
[1:26:41] no other way could be done. How
[1:26:43] ridiculous his way seem. Come on. See,
[1:26:46] God is the one who's preparing us
[1:26:48] through uh what's it called? God is the
[1:26:50] one who's preparing us through the
[1:26:51] cleansing of our heart. And that's the
[1:26:53] first step that God does. He cleans your
[1:26:56] heart because if you remember in Ezekiel
[1:26:57] he said he will give you a heart of
[1:26:59] flesh. He will give you a new heart then
[1:27:01] a new spirit then his spirit. The first
[1:27:04] thing that he works with is the heart.
[1:27:06] He tries to deal with that old nature.
[1:27:08] You see that's and he says how
[1:27:10] ridiculous is his way that he's way sin.
[1:27:14] Can you imagine a little child like
[1:27:16] David God um a little child like David
[1:27:19] taking care of sheeps when he has older
[1:27:21] brothers. When a person looks at it,
[1:27:23] they'll be like, "Why did God permit him
[1:27:25] to do that?" But they couldn't see the
[1:27:27] greater project. They couldn't see the
[1:27:29] the bigger picture. They couldn't see
[1:27:30] the panorama picture that the position
[1:27:33] that God had for him, the purpose that
[1:27:35] God had for David. They couldn't see
[1:27:36] that because when we look at it, we're
[1:27:39] saying, "Well, he's just a little boy.
[1:27:41] He should stay at home. He should play
[1:27:42] games. He should stay at home. He should
[1:27:44] uh what's it called? Go outside and play
[1:27:46] with his friends." You see? But God had
[1:27:48] other plans. God had to prepare him.
[1:27:51] That's why that's why I also find it
[1:27:53] funny because when when David was
[1:27:55] talking to Samuel and he was like let me
[1:27:57] go over there and fight Goliath and
[1:27:59] Samuel was like he was he said why would
[1:28:02] you want to go fight him he was what's
[1:28:04] it called a man of war since his youth
[1:28:06] he was a warrior since his youth and
[1:28:09] David was in his youth so if he was a
[1:28:11] man of war since his youth then when if
[1:28:14] you're if you don't want to let David to
[1:28:15] start right now how is he how is he
[1:28:19] going to be a man of war since his youth
[1:28:20] youth cuz he had to start from his youth
[1:28:22] also. You see, he needs you can't do
[1:28:25] anything without first having a
[1:28:27] beginning. It's starting. You see?
[1:28:30] And somebody say, "Well, why don't you
[1:28:33] just why didn't God just say say a
[1:28:36] certain thing? Why didn't he just put
[1:28:38] the leaves around?" Men can never
[1:28:41] understand God. You just got to believe
[1:28:43] what God says.
[1:28:45] Man, men can never understand what God
[1:28:47] has to say because his thoughts is way
[1:28:49] above ours because I had someone ask me,
[1:28:52] "Why do you uh what's it called? Listen
[1:28:54] to preachers. Why do you read the Bible?
[1:28:56] Why do you listen to uh what's it called
[1:28:58] the message and stuff?" And he was like,
[1:29:00] "If God is real, wouldn't you just don't
[1:29:03] you uh wouldn't you not need preachers?
[1:29:05] Wouldn't you just live your life and God
[1:29:07] minister to you and stuff like that?
[1:29:08] Wouldn't you just go from there?" And I
[1:29:10] and I ask him, I was like, "Why do you
[1:29:12] need textbook? Why do you need science
[1:29:13] books?" and all those why do you need it
[1:29:15] because take take it from this
[1:29:16] perspective let's say um I started
[1:29:19] building a plane and after I got to a
[1:29:21] certain part and I failed I couldn't
[1:29:22] build the plane fully if I had to write
[1:29:25] any note or let's say I I wrote notes
[1:29:27] and you come in and you start building a
[1:29:29] plane and you start from scratch you
[1:29:31] might stop a little bit ahead of me or
[1:29:34] write write um where I stopped or you
[1:29:37] might not even reach where I stopped but
[1:29:39] if you took the notes that I had of my
[1:29:42] failure and my success Yes. And you go
[1:29:44] from that. No, you will not start from
[1:29:46] scratch, but you will start where I
[1:29:48] stopped. That's where you're going to
[1:29:49] start and you will keep going. You see,
[1:29:51] and that person couldn't understand
[1:29:53] that. That's why I told him that God put
[1:29:56] all those thing orchestrated those
[1:29:58] orchestrated put the messengers and gave
[1:30:00] you brother Brandham and told you go
[1:30:01] from where brother Brandham stopped.
[1:30:03] Read the read the message and go where
[1:30:05] brother Brandham stop and keep going on.
[1:30:07] You see, because God had a preparation
[1:30:10] for you that if you take the word of God
[1:30:12] and you go from where he stopped, you
[1:30:13] will arrive somewhere greater.
[1:30:18] And brother Brand continues in the
[1:30:20] waters of separation 1955 paragraph 5
[1:30:22] says now in this great journey that the
[1:30:26] children of Israel was in at the time of
[1:30:28] the setting of this passage we have
[1:30:31] under consideration now was when Moses
[1:30:35] had went down in Egypt and had brought
[1:30:37] the children of Israel out.
[1:30:40] God in his mercy was making preparation
[1:30:44] of how that he could make a way for his
[1:30:47] people when after they had sinned to be
[1:30:51] reconciled
[1:30:53] again back to him. Wonderful, beautiful
[1:30:55] picture. See, God was preparing uh Moses
[1:30:58] to deliver the children of Israel
[1:31:01] because when uh Moses attempted to
[1:31:04] deliver them by himself, he failed. Then
[1:31:06] later on, God came in. God brought him
[1:31:08] to the mountain and God started
[1:31:09] preparing him. He said, "Put your arm in
[1:31:11] your boss after take it out and he said,
[1:31:13] "Toss the uh your staff." He turns to a
[1:31:15] snake. God was preparing him for the
[1:31:17] miracles that he will do over there.
[1:31:19] Without that preparation in the
[1:31:21] mountain, without him having that
[1:31:23] preparation, he would not be able to
[1:31:24] know what he's capable of doing. He
[1:31:27] would go in front of Pharaoh, then he
[1:31:29] wouldn't know what to do. He wouldn't
[1:31:30] know what miracles to do to demonstrate
[1:31:32] to set the people out. That's why God
[1:31:34] had prepared him to go and set the
[1:31:36] people out.
[1:31:39] And uh Moses didn't prepare himself
[1:31:42] because when God called him, he even
[1:31:43] told God, uh I I can't speak. I have I
[1:31:47] have no words in my mouth. I have like a
[1:31:48] speech impediment. I can't speak. So you
[1:31:51] come in and you speak. You be with me.
[1:31:53] You go with me. So God was was preparing
[1:31:55] it.
[1:31:57] Now
[1:31:58] I want you to see it. as Moses went down
[1:32:02] to deliver the children of Israel, how
[1:32:04] God worked miracles. The people had got
[1:32:07] into a time just about like they are
[1:32:10] now, just like today. By the way, their
[1:32:13] journey from Egypt to Palestine was a
[1:32:15] type of the church in its journey today.
[1:32:19] They were led naturally. We are led
[1:32:21] spiritually. I know many teachers of the
[1:32:24] school say that the promised land was
[1:32:27] represented in was represented heaven.
[1:32:29] But I think it represents the millennium
[1:32:32] because they had wars and troubles still
[1:32:36] and in in the promised land there in the
[1:32:38] promised land there shouldn't be any war
[1:32:39] and and tribulation. And the other
[1:32:42] things when I was when I was reading
[1:32:43] this when I was reviewing this the other
[1:32:45] thing that stuck out to me he said that
[1:32:48] brother said that uh what's it
[1:32:51] called? I think it represents the
[1:32:54] millennium because they had wars and
[1:32:56] troubles. And when I read that because
[1:32:58] they had wars and trouble, that reminded
[1:32:59] me when they got out of Egypt, God could
[1:33:01] have brought them to their destination
[1:33:02] easily and quick, but their faith wasn't
[1:33:05] there. So God had to prepare their
[1:33:06] faith, had to boost their faith. And not
[1:33:08] only that, they came out of Egypt as
[1:33:10] slaves. So they they have no experience
[1:33:13] of fighting. So God pulled them to the
[1:33:16] trials so they could fight. That way
[1:33:18] when they once they arrive at the
[1:33:20] promised land, they could also defend
[1:33:22] their promised land. So God was
[1:33:24] preparing them to also defend their own
[1:33:26] land. You see, as they're walking, as
[1:33:28] they're journeying through their
[1:33:30] habitation, their holy habitation, but
[1:33:32] there's as they're journeying to the
[1:33:33] promised land, God is preparing them to
[1:33:35] also um protect their own promised land.
[1:33:38] You see? Amen. Because if God had
[1:33:41] brought them um if God had brought them
[1:33:43] directly to the promised land, they have
[1:33:44] no experience on how to fight. They have
[1:33:46] no experience on how to fend off the
[1:33:48] enemy, how to um gain land. They have no
[1:33:51] experience of that. So God had to take
[1:33:52] them through a a reroute, a reroute.
[1:33:55] It's not that God because sometimes in
[1:33:58] our life God would take us to a reroute.
[1:33:59] He would just reroute us. It's not that
[1:34:02] he's not that he's taking you away from
[1:34:04] your promises. He's just making you
[1:34:06] circle a little bit because you need a
[1:34:08] long you need more time for preparation.
[1:34:11] You're not ready yet. So he would take
[1:34:12] you the longer route.
[1:34:15] And in 55, brother Brandon continue
[1:34:17] paragraph 12. He says, "I want you to
[1:34:19] notice they went up a mixed multitude
[1:34:22] and that and that caused trouble among
[1:34:25] them as they got up there." See, the
[1:34:28] worst is the mixed multitude. Because as
[1:34:30] someone that's not a believer, you
[1:34:32] already know he doesn't believe. You
[1:34:32] might as well keep walking. Because my
[1:34:34] father always told me, "You can't argue
[1:34:35] with a fool. If you argue with a fool,
[1:34:37] you're worse than a fool." Because the
[1:34:38] fool can never understand what you're
[1:34:40] talking about. You see? So, a mixed
[1:34:42] multitude, there's someone that's there
[1:34:44] in disguise to trick you. And when the
[1:34:46] devil all he needs to to just plant a
[1:34:49] seed of doubt in you and he will come
[1:34:51] back later on to see that seed of doubt
[1:34:53] and if that seed of doubt is still there
[1:34:54] and you have not erased it. If that seed
[1:34:57] of doubt is still there it will sprout.
[1:35:00] It will sprout and brother Bren
[1:35:02] continues that the mo mixed multitude
[1:35:05] they they caused trouble among them as
[1:35:07] they got up there. God in his servant in
[1:35:11] his sovereign mercy not willing that any
[1:35:14] should perish. See God so loved the
[1:35:16] world that he did not he did not want to
[1:35:18] lose any of us. That's why the the word
[1:35:21] even came to say that many are called.
[1:35:22] The the scripture says that grace
[1:35:25] appears to all but not all receive grace
[1:35:29] because grace will come to you. It
[1:35:31] appears to everyone. The word is
[1:35:33] ministered to everyone. I had a coworker
[1:35:35] and after I spoke to him about brother
[1:35:36] Brenham, he say he heard of brother
[1:35:37] Brennham but he's not in there. He's not
[1:35:39] he was he heard the word but he's not he
[1:35:42] did not receive it. You see because many
[1:35:44] are called but not but few are uh what's
[1:35:47] it called? Chosen.
[1:35:49] And it continues
[1:35:50] says not willing that any should perish
[1:35:54] because that's the love of God but that
[1:35:56] all might come to repentance. always
[1:36:00] makes prep makes a preparation of a way
[1:36:03] of escape for those who desire to come
[1:36:06] by the way of escape. See the
[1:36:09] preparation that God makes is for those
[1:36:12] who desire to escape. That mean you have
[1:36:14] to have a desire in you and that desire
[1:36:15] in you is something that God had placed
[1:36:18] in you. God has to put that desire in
[1:36:20] you to come to him because human in our
[1:36:22] own will we will not desire God. When we
[1:36:24] look at the ways of God, we say it's too
[1:36:26] harsh. Because when uh God wanted to
[1:36:28] talk to Israel, the Israelite children,
[1:36:31] he said he wanted them to uh speak, he
[1:36:34] wanted to speak to his people. The
[1:36:36] people were scared and they said, "No,
[1:36:37] Moses, you go talk to God." You see,
[1:36:40] Moses, you go to talk to God because
[1:36:42] they were scared.
[1:36:44] And brother Brandon continues, he says,
[1:36:47] "He did it in the anti-oluvian world. He
[1:36:50] did a in the days of the calling out of
[1:36:52] Noah or Moses rather calling out of the
[1:36:56] Israel. He did a in the days of the Lord
[1:36:59] Jesus and he's doing it yet today just
[1:37:02] before just before the judgments are to
[1:37:05] strike the world. Yes sir. God is
[1:37:07] calling out a people those who are
[1:37:10] willing to walk and take God's
[1:37:12] preparation
[1:37:14] how to escape the wrath that's coming
[1:37:17] upon the earth. Yes, sir. I trust that
[1:37:20] none that's in the divine presence
[1:37:23] tonight or will be that mean tonight as
[1:37:26] in the div see brother Brandham did not
[1:37:28] say that I trust that none that's in
[1:37:31] this building tonight he said that's in
[1:37:32] the divine presence tonight because this
[1:37:34] building is not the thing that saves you
[1:37:36] this building is not the thing that
[1:37:38] brings you closer to God but when you
[1:37:40] enter into the divine presence of God
[1:37:43] you enter into Christ that's the thing
[1:37:44] that saves you that's why he say I trust
[1:37:46] that none that's in the divine divine
[1:37:49] presence tonight or will be will ever
[1:37:52] have to stay here and suffer through the
[1:37:55] great wrath of God. That's soon to come
[1:37:57] on the earth that there's no way of all
[1:38:01] of escaping it. See, there's no other
[1:38:03] way beside that way of escaping it. You
[1:38:06] have to reach that divine presence of
[1:38:08] God. Amen. Amen. And brother Brandon
[1:38:10] continues says in 8 paragraph 81 of
[1:38:12] God's provided way 1956, "If you were
[1:38:16] going to take your child to a party of
[1:38:18] some of some sort, would you not prepare
[1:38:21] it and get its dress ready and so forth
[1:38:26] or its little suit, whatever the child
[1:38:29] might be, boy or girl, you would make
[1:38:31] arrangement. That's it.
[1:38:34] You would make arrangement for that.
[1:38:36] Excuse me.
[1:38:47] Excuse me. Uh he will make arrangement
[1:38:50] for that just as now. Brother Brandon
[1:38:52] say he was uh brother Brandon himself
[1:38:54] identified himself of uh being a
[1:38:56] typologist. He say he did not have
[1:38:57] education. So the only way that he can
[1:38:59] explain it is by typing it. So over here
[1:39:02] brother Brandham is typing God's
[1:39:04] preparation to the way we prepare
[1:39:05] things. He's using that as an example so
[1:39:08] we can understand it because remember
[1:39:10] God's thought it's way higher than us.
[1:39:11] So the way that we can at least try to
[1:39:14] understand even a fraction of the way
[1:39:16] God thinks is by using examples that God
[1:39:18] let us experience. You see and he
[1:39:21] continues says if you were going to
[1:39:23] entertain to entertain company would not
[1:39:27] for dinner would not you first get your
[1:39:29] dinner made ready. Four, you make ready
[1:39:33] for these things. Just as you make ready
[1:39:35] for the things of the Lord, you make
[1:39:38] ready for these great blessings that
[1:39:41] comes that you can give to people.
[1:39:44] That's right. Just like uh ministers,
[1:39:46] they make ready to give blessing to
[1:39:48] people. You see, they have to prepare
[1:39:50] themselves. They have to prepare their
[1:39:51] uh service. Don't you like to entertain
[1:39:54] people? Do not do not you like to go out
[1:39:58] and take people to your home and
[1:39:59] entertain them to you clean up
[1:40:02] everything. You fix everything. Yes,
[1:40:03] sir. You put a little flower over here.
[1:40:07] This is just the way this is just the
[1:40:11] way they would like it. You fix a little
[1:40:13] thing here. Now I see they are they like
[1:40:16] this. And so you fix you would fix it.
[1:40:19] Just making arrangements. And I know
[1:40:21] that they like this kind of meat. So you
[1:40:24] prepare that meat real spicy and real
[1:40:27] nice. You see you prepare it the way
[1:40:29] they like it say because and if you
[1:40:32] can't feel that you do it you get
[1:40:35] somebody else come to do it who can do
[1:40:39] it better. You are making
[1:40:41] arrangements preparations for something
[1:40:44] because you want your guest to be highly
[1:40:47] entertained.
[1:40:49] You want them highly entertained.
[1:40:51] Brother Brandon said God hate sunrise.
[1:40:54] Sometimes he want his children, he want
[1:40:57] his children to have the best. And the
[1:40:59] best that God has for us is the Holy
[1:41:02] Ghost. Because if you remember when we
[1:41:04] were going through when the word was
[1:41:06] coming forth and teaching us about
[1:41:07] prayer that about our daily bread about
[1:41:10] our daily bread could be anything. It
[1:41:11] could go from the littlest thing as
[1:41:13] gift, food, money. And after the highest
[1:41:16] gift that the daily bread can represent
[1:41:18] is the Holy Ghost, the best. And God
[1:41:20] always prepared the best for his
[1:41:22] children. And he said, "So he made the
[1:41:25] preparations." That's right. He
[1:41:27] foreshadowed it through the prophets. He
[1:41:29] revealed it in Christ. And the table is
[1:41:33] set today. He said today. Amen. And
[1:41:37] every every man and woman that's invited
[1:41:41] has a welcome to come to this table.
[1:41:45] For he was wounded for our
[1:41:47] transgression. And with his trust we are
[1:41:50] healed. It's all foreseen. It's provided
[1:41:54] and prepared. The meal is ready. The
[1:41:57] call is given for he foraw. He prep he
[1:42:01] he made preparation. It's God's provided
[1:42:04] way for you. When your souls are ready.
[1:42:07] I mean when your souls are hungry.
[1:42:08] Because if you remember when you go to
[1:42:10] the tabernacle, there's also a table of
[1:42:11] the showbread. There's a table that's
[1:42:13] already ready. All you have to do just
[1:42:15] go and eat. See the the table
[1:42:17] represented the church ages where you go
[1:42:19] and after you uh the candlestick
[1:42:21] represented the church ages but the
[1:42:22] table represented where you go and eat
[1:42:24] the word that um that the messenger of
[1:42:28] your time gave forth. You go and you
[1:42:30] feed on that. And over here saying that
[1:42:32] God had already he already prepared the
[1:42:34] table. He already sent the call like the
[1:42:37] virgin bride. He already sent the call.
[1:42:39] Right.
[1:42:41] And Kikot says, "Now preparation." God
[1:42:44] before he does anything, he always makes
[1:42:46] a prepare for it. He always prepares for
[1:42:49] it. He How could we? As it's spoke in
[1:42:53] the Bible, if we before we could go over
[1:42:55] to fight a war, remember first we have
[1:42:59] to prepare for that war. Remember, we're
[1:43:01] a soldier of Christ. We have to prepare
[1:43:03] for that war. So, let's find out how we
[1:43:05] prepare for that war. If you're going to
[1:43:08] get married, why you prepare for that
[1:43:11] time? See, whenever you That's why we're
[1:43:14] having courtship and stuff like that.
[1:43:16] Those are preparation. Courtship
[1:43:17] supposed to prepare you and form you so
[1:43:19] when you get into marriage so that way
[1:43:22] you can have you can know what to
[1:43:24] expect. You see, that's what courtship
[1:43:26] is for. You You're supposed to plant the
[1:43:28] seed, the seed of God, the seed of the
[1:43:30] word in courtship. That way that seed
[1:43:33] you will reap what you sow at the
[1:43:35] beginning throughout as you walk into
[1:43:37] your marriage life. You see that's how
[1:43:39] God is
[1:43:40] preparing and you have preparations and
[1:43:43] before you come to church you made
[1:43:45] preparations and the ambulance to bring
[1:43:47] you or your loved one to bring you or
[1:43:50] you had to get a certain amount of money
[1:43:52] ready before you could come. It's
[1:43:54] preparation. All of those is
[1:43:56] preparation. And God is always and God
[1:43:59] is always prepares the people for the
[1:44:01] events that's just about to happen. Just
[1:44:04] like the rapture is just about to
[1:44:07] happen. And God is preparing his people
[1:44:09] to step into their position. And just
[1:44:12] like the tribulation is also about to
[1:44:13] happen. And God is preparing the world
[1:44:15] for their um position in the
[1:44:17] tribulation. You see,
[1:44:20] and and some of God's preparation has
[1:44:23] been so ridiculous to the people who
[1:44:26] depend on the tree of knowledge. God's
[1:44:29] preparation has been absolutely
[1:44:31] ridiculous to the natural mind cuz the
[1:44:34] natural mind can't conceive the things
[1:44:37] that are of God because they are foolish
[1:44:40] to him and he just thinks it's horrible
[1:44:43] to think of why why God would do it.
[1:44:47] Amen. Amen. And brother Brand continues
[1:44:50] in in Elijah, he says, "What are we
[1:44:52] going to do?" No wonder God shut off. No
[1:44:55] wonder we ought to get ready. See, we
[1:44:58] have to get ready because we also have
[1:44:59] our parts that we have to do to get
[1:45:01] ready. We have to get ready. I believe
[1:45:04] over in Amos, he said, "Prepare to meet
[1:45:06] God, oh Israel, being that you wouldn't
[1:45:10] hear the message and so forth said
[1:45:13] prepare." And if and if there ever was a
[1:45:18] time that the world ought to be
[1:45:19] preparing for the second coming of
[1:45:21] Christ is now. Hear it. You prepare for
[1:45:26] wedding. You say why I must prepare. Why
[1:45:30] must I start to get ready to meet God?
[1:45:33] Preacher, what are you speaking? You
[1:45:36] preparing for a wedding, you can be
[1:45:38] disappointed because you can prepare for
[1:45:40] a wedding and after that you're
[1:45:41] preparing for that at on the last
[1:45:43] minute. find out that the man was not
[1:45:45] what you expected or the wife was not
[1:45:46] the woman was not what you expected.
[1:45:48] See, and after the wedding could get
[1:45:50] cancelled, you could be in courtship and
[1:45:51] after you were you had um you're
[1:45:54] preparing for or you prepare for your
[1:45:56] marriage and after you get in marriage
[1:45:58] and after that you're disappointed or
[1:46:00] everything else that you've seen people
[1:46:01] showing and after you're disappointed
[1:46:03] because you're not seeing what people
[1:46:05] were displaying in your own marriage,
[1:46:08] you will be disappointed. There are
[1:46:10] certain things that we're we think for
[1:46:11] example a party you can prepare a party
[1:46:13] and after that people come into the
[1:46:14] party and let's say the party supposed
[1:46:17] to start at 3:00 and that starts at
[1:46:19] 6:00. See you're you are you will be
[1:46:21] disappointed. You see because you came
[1:46:23] you were prepared. You prepared
[1:46:25] yourself. You even came 30 minutes at a
[1:46:27] time and after you arrive there and
[1:46:29] after you find that it didn't even start
[1:46:31] yet. See you're disappointed. And the
[1:46:33] prophet saying that in our own way we're
[1:46:36] this we will get disappointed in our own
[1:46:38] preparation.
[1:46:40] And he continued, yes sir, you can say I
[1:46:44] prepare for a great meeting somewhere or
[1:46:47] something
[1:46:48] or something another you can be
[1:46:50] disappointed in that. But there's one
[1:46:54] preparation that you're not going to be
[1:46:57] disappointed. That's you. That's you got
[1:47:00] to meet God. Every one of you. Every one
[1:47:03] of you. You've got to meet God. So,
[1:47:07] so what m So, what makes me think? Every
[1:47:10] time I know, see a gray hair. It speaks
[1:47:13] to me. I must get ready to meet God.
[1:47:17] Every time I hear a siren, I know that I
[1:47:20] must meet God. It's preparation time.
[1:47:22] Every time I hear of every time I hear
[1:47:25] of a death or anything, it's preparation
[1:47:28] time. God's preparing.
[1:47:30] And when you're And when you see those
[1:47:32] things to see to see you sickness to and
[1:47:36] see the doctor's
[1:47:37] office, you see those things. It's a
[1:47:41] warning. Prepare to meet God for it's
[1:47:44] it's for it's at hand. See, the prophet
[1:47:46] is saying that every single time he sees
[1:47:48] certain sign, he says that it's
[1:47:50] preparing him. And to him it
[1:47:53] just it's just a reminder to him to
[1:47:55] prepare to get ready because something
[1:47:57] great is about to happen. Something is
[1:47:58] fixing to happen. Because I remember a
[1:48:00] beloved had asked me uh what's it
[1:48:02] called? How is life? And I was like oh
[1:48:04] life is interesting. Then they kept
[1:48:05] insisting oh how is life interesting and
[1:48:08] I only say interesting because well I
[1:48:11] guess I wanted to dodge the question I
[1:48:12] guess in some sense. Then I was like I
[1:48:14] don't know. Then they were like well
[1:48:16] you're the one who answered it. Then I
[1:48:17] say it was inspiration that came. They
[1:48:19] were like, "That's even better. I'm
[1:48:20] trying to get out of the question." That
[1:48:22] they're pulling me back into it. And
[1:48:24] then I said, "The reason why life was
[1:48:26] interesting was because of the Bible.
[1:48:28] The Bible made life interesting." That
[1:48:30] they were like, "Leave the Bible alone."
[1:48:32] Then something came to me and say, "Why
[1:48:34] would you leave the Bible alone? The
[1:48:35] Bible says life is Jesus Christ." Jesus
[1:48:36] is life. So you can't leave it alone. So
[1:48:39] I was like, "Life is Jesus." Then he was
[1:48:41] like, "What did you read in the
[1:48:42] scripture that made life interesting?"
[1:48:43] And the thing is whenever you're reading
[1:48:45] a scripture and you're reading the you
[1:48:48] can also apply in the message whenever
[1:48:49] you're reading a scripture that that
[1:48:52] scripture can be applied to so many
[1:48:54] avenues in your life and the fact that
[1:48:56] it can be applied to so many avenues in
[1:48:58] your life. It's supposed to be preparing
[1:49:00] you. It's supposed to remind you that
[1:49:01] something is fixing to happen. And by it
[1:49:04] reminding you something is fixing to
[1:49:05] happen, it will make your life more fun.
[1:49:07] It will make your life more interesting.
[1:49:09] It will make your life more enjoyable.
[1:49:12] It'll make your life more enjoyable.
[1:49:14] Now,
[1:49:16] the prophet says in preparation,
[1:49:17] paragraph 33, God in his preparation,
[1:49:20] back when God was going to destroy the
[1:49:22] world before he destroyed the world, he
[1:49:25] sent forth a preparation for the saving
[1:49:27] of the people that desired to be saved.
[1:49:30] He always does it. He shows mercy before
[1:49:33] judgment. So, you have to have that
[1:49:35] desire in you. You have to have that
[1:49:36] seed in you for you to even be saved.
[1:49:38] Amen. In the last days, I'll pour out my
[1:49:42] spirit upon all flesh. Your sons and
[1:49:46] your daughters shall prophesy upon my
[1:49:49] handmmaids and maid servants will I pour
[1:49:53] out my spirit. I'll show signs in the in
[1:49:55] the heaven above and in the earth below.
[1:49:59] Pillar of fire, vapors of smoke. Your
[1:50:02] old men shall dream dreams. Your young
[1:50:04] men shall see vision. Is that right?
[1:50:07] How how's he going to do it? I don't
[1:50:11] know. But we're going to but we're going
[1:50:13] to take place. I mean, we're going to
[1:50:15] take over. We don't need to worry about
[1:50:17] how God that's what faith is. We don't
[1:50:18] need to worry about how it's going to be
[1:50:20] done. Just like just like when my sister
[1:50:22] had told me, take the pot, put water,
[1:50:24] and put it in the stove. My body, I
[1:50:26] didn't even think about how the energy
[1:50:27] or the power was going to come going to
[1:50:30] uh what's it called? Return. What I did
[1:50:31] was just walked and I placed it there.
[1:50:34] The same thing when I walked to the
[1:50:35] fridge, that was all faith operating. I
[1:50:37] just went and I open. I did not expect
[1:50:39] how the energy was going to come because
[1:50:41] later on I even received the text that
[1:50:43] had told me that the energy was going to
[1:50:45] be restored at 400 p.m. But we were
[1:50:47] still around like 1 um 1:00 p.m. So the
[1:50:50] energy came back sooner because of faith
[1:50:52] because all I did was just open it that
[1:50:54] faith activated. Faith started the
[1:50:57] energy back up.
[1:50:59] And
[1:51:00] just to try to close, there's a perfect
[1:51:04] type of Christ and the church, Elijah, a
[1:51:08] type of Christ, the the mighty prophet
[1:51:11] of God. And notice just before his going
[1:51:14] away, knowing that he was he was to go
[1:51:17] away. He didn't leave the nation without
[1:51:20] witness. He made preparation for a man
[1:51:23] to take his place. God's witness. How
[1:51:26] beautiful. Christ did the same thing
[1:51:29] before he left. As God's witness, he
[1:51:32] made preparation of a church and
[1:51:34] ordained that they would witness. They
[1:51:38] would be witnesses all the way through
[1:51:40] the church age plump to the end of the
[1:51:43] world. And God is preparing a church
[1:51:45] today. And he's preparing you to the
[1:51:47] preaching of the word. And he's
[1:51:48] preparing if uh musician could start
[1:51:50] coming if he will prepare. He's
[1:51:52] preparing you to the preaching of the
[1:51:53] word. God is telling you that he's the
[1:51:55] one who's preparing everything. It's
[1:51:57] nothing that you need to do. There's no
[1:51:59] works that you need to be working
[1:52:01] because humans when certain pressure
[1:52:03] comes or certain things come humans
[1:52:05] wants to prepare themsel as the prophet
[1:52:08] said they want to prepare themselves and
[1:52:09] God is telling you that you don't need
[1:52:11] to worry about that. He's the one who
[1:52:13] made preparation. In fact, God let you
[1:52:15] prepare yourself and let you fail and
[1:52:18] fall so he can show you that your ways
[1:52:19] is wrong. So he can show you that his
[1:52:21] ways is better, that his thoughts are
[1:52:23] better for you. Amen. And if the
[1:52:27] congregation can
[1:52:33] stand, if we could go to the Lord in
[1:52:37] prayer, if you could bow our heart.
[1:52:42] Lord, heavenly father, I thank you, Lord
[1:52:44] God,
[1:52:45] for everything that you've been doing. I
[1:52:47] thank you Lord Jesus Christ for
[1:52:49] preparing us Lord heavenly father for
[1:52:51] sending out a message Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:52:53] I thank you for sending out a message of
[1:52:54] preparation. Sending a message, Lord
[1:52:56] Jesus Christ, to get us ready, Lord,
[1:52:58] heavenly father, to get us ready for
[1:52:59] when you come, Lord Jesus
[1:53:01] Christ. You you're preparing us, Lord,
[1:53:04] heavenly father, so we can be a
[1:53:05] reflection of you, Lord heavenly father.
[1:53:06] That when we look at the scripture, Lord
[1:53:08] Heavenly Father, that we're supposed to
[1:53:09] see oursel as we're seeing you, we're
[1:53:11] supposed to also see oursel, Lord God.
[1:53:13] When we see you, we're supposed to see
[1:53:14] us, Lord Jesus Christ. And Lord God,
[1:53:16] before even sin, Lord Jesus Christ,
[1:53:18] could enter, you already prepared a
[1:53:20] sacrifice, Lord God. And then you you
[1:53:23] manifested that sacrifice in Calvary
[1:53:24] Lord heavenly father. You prepare that
[1:53:26] sacrifice to erase our sins, Lord Jesus
[1:53:29] Christ. To erase us, Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:53:30] To erase that thought, Lord Jesus
[1:53:33] Christ, that that that keeps coming upon
[1:53:35] us that telling us, "Well, you're s
[1:53:37] you're sinner." You erase that, Lord
[1:53:38] Jesus Christ. And after that, you
[1:53:40] covered us with your own covering, Lord
[1:53:41] Jesus Christ. And that whenever you come
[1:53:43] and you're looking at us, you're not
[1:53:44] looking at us through ours our own
[1:53:46] preparation, but you're looking at us
[1:53:47] through your preparation. And I pray,
[1:53:49] Lord, heavenly father, that you may help
[1:53:50] us be obedient to the word. Help us be
[1:53:52] obedient to your word and listen to your
[1:53:53] word. Let help us just let your word
[1:53:56] prepare us Lord Jesus Christ. H help us
[1:53:58] let your word prepare us and condition
[1:54:01] us Lord Jesus Christ for your glory to
[1:54:02] come Lord heavenly father. I bend and
[1:54:04] remaining of the service unto you Lord
[1:54:06] Jesus Christ. If anything that may have
[1:54:08] left out Lord Jesus Christ may you speak
[1:54:09] to your children Lord Jesus Christ. May
[1:54:11] you just be with them Lord heavenly
[1:54:13] father and may you prepare them. May
[1:54:14] their preparation not just stop here
[1:54:16] Lord heavenly father. For the scriptures
[1:54:17] say Lord Jesus Christ you're preparing
[1:54:18] us on our way. That mean as we're
[1:54:20] traveling, Lord Jesus Christ, as we're
[1:54:22] going from Sunday to Sunday, Wednesday
[1:54:23] to Wednesday, may you continue and
[1:54:25] prepare us, prepare us for the next
[1:54:26] service, prepare for the next service
[1:54:28] until one day Lord Heavenly Father, when
[1:54:30] these doors are closed, Lord Jesus
[1:54:31] Christ, we'll be Lord Heavenly Father,
[1:54:33] up in heaven with you, Lord Jesus
[1:54:34] Christ, and we'll be fellowshipping with
[1:54:36] you, Lord Jesus Christ. And we'll
[1:54:37] continue, Lord Jesus, to fellowship with
[1:54:39] you. Prepare us, Lord, heavenly father,
[1:54:41] to accept you, Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:54:42] Prepare us, Lord heavenly father, to
[1:54:44] just for your for your will to be done
[1:54:47] in us. prepare us for your glory to be
[1:54:49] manifested in us, Lord heavenly father.
[1:54:51] That is the that is the desire that I'm
[1:54:53] asking, Lord God, that you may prepare
[1:54:55] us for. That's what you even sent the
[1:54:56] Holy Ghost for, Lord Jesus Christ. You
[1:54:58] sent the Holy Ghost to prepare us, Lord.
[1:55:00] Heavenly Father, you send the Holy Ghost
[1:55:01] to reinforce us, Lord heavenly father.
[1:55:03] You send the Holy Ghost to condition us,
[1:55:05] to make the atmosphere ready for your
[1:55:07] coming, Lord heavenly father, you send
[1:55:08] the Holy Ghost for that sole purpose of
[1:55:10] preparation, Lord Jesus Christ. And I
[1:55:12] thank you for everything and I thank you
[1:55:14] through everything. In Jesus Christ's
[1:55:15] name I pray. Amen. God bless you church.
[1:55:18] If the pastor could come for
[1:55:22] [Applause]
[1:55:25] [Music]
[1:55:30] Praise God. Amen. Amen. You heard the
[1:55:35] message nice and clear. It's about
[1:55:38] preparation.
[1:55:39] Amen.
[1:55:41] Preparation. If you look at the world
[1:55:44] and everything that is going on in the
[1:55:46] world and if you don't see a preparation
[1:55:48] time, I don't know what to tell you.
[1:55:51] Amen. Everything is upside and down.
[1:55:55] There are certain things I cannot speak
[1:55:57] here because I'm on YouTube. Maybe when
[1:55:59] I'm in question and answer then I can
[1:56:01] dig and you will see what is happening.
[1:56:03] It's a mess all around. Because the hope
[1:56:08] of this world is not in a man.
[1:56:11] That's right. It is not in a country. It
[1:56:15] is not in a party. It is not in whatever
[1:56:19] you think. The hope, the only hope is in
[1:56:22] Jesus Christ. If you take Jesus Christ
[1:56:26] out,
[1:56:29] sometime it's amazing how I see
[1:56:31] believers sucked in in politics.
[1:56:35] Exactly. And you just shake your head.
[1:56:37] You say, "What is wrong? What are you
[1:56:39] expecting?
[1:56:41] Amen. You yourself, you cannot do good
[1:56:43] to your brother.
[1:56:46] And I don't know what you're expecting
[1:56:48] some other people to do to you. Put your
[1:56:51] faith in the Lord.
[1:56:54] Amen. It is a time of preparation.
[1:56:58] Amen. Preparation. Preparation.
[1:57:01] Preparation. You know, technology is
[1:57:03] getting so fancy. Yes, I got my clicker
[1:57:06] that I usually hold it like this. But if
[1:57:09] you notice, he get a clicker like a
[1:57:11] ring. So, he's not married yet. It was a
[1:57:15] clicker.
[1:57:17] [Laughter]
[1:57:19] So, just in case you wonder what was in
[1:57:21] the finger, the brother is wearing a
[1:57:23] ring. He's not wearing a ring. It was
[1:57:25] just a clicker that looks like a ring
[1:57:28] and you clicking as you're moving on.
[1:57:30] So, I just want to clarify the air so
[1:57:33] nobody think like he's wearing a ring.
[1:57:36] Amen. Amen. Glory. Glory to God. I like
[1:57:40] when he said the guests need to be
[1:57:42] highly entertained.
[1:57:44] I need to read that again. In an
[1:57:47] oncoming meeting, the guests need to be
[1:57:50] highly entertained.
[1:57:53] Amen. And he say in courtship, you need
[1:57:56] to put a seed. I'm like, I have not even
[1:57:59] started a courtship with you folks. Now
[1:58:01] you already know what to do. But I know
[1:58:03] he was one of the one that went to the
[1:58:05] sister and keep knocking at his own
[1:58:07] sister to tell them what I mean to ask
[1:58:10] what did the sister learn over there. So
[1:58:12] I already cut my he doesn't want to look
[1:58:15] at he went to the sister can you tell me
[1:58:17] what is going I say hold on your time is
[1:58:20] coming up. Amen. Remember the
[1:58:22] preparation of the Lord. God sent a
[1:58:25] message to prepare. as John the Baptist
[1:58:28] that was the commission of this message.
[1:58:31] Amen. Was sent to prepare. This message
[1:58:33] was sent to prepare us. That's why there
[1:58:36] is nothing we can uphold in this church
[1:58:38] but the word the message of the hour.
[1:58:41] Stay with the message of the hour. Give
[1:58:43] yourself to the message of the hour.
[1:58:46] Stay focused with the message of the
[1:58:48] hour. This message has been proven and
[1:58:50] no matter what is happening, God is
[1:58:53] vindicated. his message on uh February
[1:58:55] the 28th, 7 Planet Align. No, no one
[1:58:59] want to talk about it.
[1:59:02] The critic about this message don't want
[1:59:04] to say anything.
[1:59:06] They don't want to say anything because
[1:59:08] they know something is happening. It is
[1:59:10] clear as clear. I I don't I don't even
[1:59:12] know what to say. It's there. This pope
[1:59:15] is dead. Now they kind of watching
[1:59:17] again. How many son do you want to see?
[1:59:21] Hallelujah. The woman with a purple
[1:59:23] garment. This is the second trump. What?
[1:59:26] What else do you want to see to get your
[1:59:28] life straightened up? What else? There
[1:59:30] will be war, rumors of war, all type of
[1:59:33] stuff, famine, everything all over the
[1:59:35] world. What else do you want to see?
[1:59:39] Amen. Amen. We are worshiping one God
[1:59:43] and his name is the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:59:46] It's not three God, it's one. His name
[1:59:48] is the Lord Jesus Christ. and that God
[1:59:51] loves you and he made preparation for
[1:59:53] you. Church, the best that I can do.
[1:59:56] Let's get focused with the word. Parent,
[1:59:59] let's get focused with the word. Daddy,
[2:00:01] get focused to the word. Mommy, get
[2:00:04] focused to the word. Amen. The word will
[2:00:07] take you through. Brother Brandham say
[2:00:09] the same camel that Rebecca was giving
[2:00:13] water was the camel that took Rebecca
[2:00:16] all the way in. In one place he said the
[2:00:19] camel was the holy spirit. In one place
[2:00:21] he said the camel was the word because
[2:00:23] the spirit and the word are one. Amen.
[2:00:27] Remember God is coming. Let's pray.
[2:00:30] Heavenly father Lord we approaching you
[2:00:33] again humbly tonight. Father we thank
[2:00:35] you for your grace, your love, your
[2:00:37] mercy for speaking not only to us but to
[2:00:40] the invisible audience about the
[2:00:43] preparation. Father, preparation goes to
[2:00:46] many aspect of our life. Even before we
[2:00:49] wake up in the morning, we prepare. We
[2:00:51] are preparing our phone. We are
[2:00:53] preparing the children for school. We're
[2:00:55] preparing the clothing we will be
[2:00:57] wearing. We're preparing our car. So
[2:00:59] many things. There is nothing pretty
[2:01:01] much in our life that we don't approach
[2:01:03] it without a preparation, Lord. Father,
[2:01:06] we pray, Lord, Father, for the greatest
[2:01:08] preparation that none of us here Lord
[2:01:11] Father be distracted from it, Lord. But
[2:01:13] as the day is going by, may we remember
[2:01:16] at any time like your prophet say when
[2:01:19] we hear about a death, a siren going on
[2:01:22] or somebody getting sick or a war
[2:01:24] somewhere, we just remember the Lord is
[2:01:27] coming. We need to get prepared, Lord.
[2:01:29] Father, protect us as we go into our
[2:01:31] respective place. May you give us travel
[2:01:34] mercy. May you strengthen your man's
[2:01:36] servant. May you be with us Lord and
[2:01:38] continue to work in this church in a
[2:01:40] powerful way as we committing the
[2:01:42] remaining of the week unto our hand and
[2:01:44] humbly ask it father in the name of
[2:01:47] Jesus Christ. Amen. Go ahead.
