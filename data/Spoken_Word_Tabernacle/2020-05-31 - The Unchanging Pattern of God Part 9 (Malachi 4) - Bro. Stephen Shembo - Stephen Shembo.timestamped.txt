[35:53] Jesus easy amen
[35:58] god bless you we greet you all in the
[36:01] name of Jesus Christ those that are here
[36:04] and those that are online streaming so
[36:08] the brothers have not helped
[36:12] express any burning yet so by the grace
[36:15] of God we continue with our thoughts
[36:18] Genesis chapter 8 verse 6 we need your
[36:26] spiritual life saver
[36:30] jacket some of you know how to swim so
[36:39] when I say that I don't mean everybody
[36:41] some of you already know how to swim
[36:43] some are still learning so if you dare
[36:47] you can say amen verse thinks I need to
[36:56] go slowly and he came to pass at the end
[37:01] of 40 days that Noah opened the window
[37:05] of the ark which he had made you might
[37:09] be seated I was coming with my wife and
[37:15] there was a truck driving in front of me
[37:17] and they draw a crow a raven
[37:23] and they also wrote on the truck Raven
[37:26] so I told my wife I'd say look at that
[37:29] she said whoa that's not good in Jesus
[37:31] name she didn't know you was to me a
[37:34] confirmation of this message amen
[37:41] verse seven and he sent forth a raven
[37:44] now you saw the Raven so it was a
[37:47] confirmation that I'm lineup and he sent
[37:51] forth a raven which went forth to and
[37:55] fro that word to and fro does not mean
[37:59] that the raven was going in and out if
[38:01] you look in another translation to infra
[38:05] means that when the raven left the ark
[38:07] the raven was going from places to
[38:10] places in other word the Raven never
[38:13] came back to the ark he stayed outside
[38:15] there was no more rain and the Raven
[38:18] keep feasting on whatever was out there
[38:20] so he stayed up there so the first time
[38:24] or the first ministry that Noah is
[38:28] pushing forward is a raven and are even
[38:36] when he went in begin to go from places
[38:38] to places and the Raven never came back
[38:41] if you notice the revenues in the ark
[38:44] there Evan lived in Ark but one of this
[38:49] day a window was open for the Raven to
[38:53] leave the ark and was the Raven left the
[38:58] ark the true nature of the Raven was
[39:02] revealed inside the ark draven could
[39:06] feast with the food that Noah carry in
[39:10] the earth but once the resin left the
[39:14] earth then the true nature that was
[39:17] covered under the ark came out everybody
[39:22] clear
[39:24] hallelujah until the waters were dried
[39:28] up from of the earth verse 8 also he
[39:33] sent forth a dove
[39:36] so number one a raven comes out and
[39:39] after the raven as the ministry
[39:42] progresses we find out that the ministry
[39:46] was changed from a raven to a ministry
[39:49] of a dog everybody clear you must
[39:52] understand this now because down the
[39:55] road things are going to change
[39:57] hallelujah he said and he also sent
[40:00] forth a dove from him to see if the
[40:04] water's were abated so the water we know
[40:08] in the Bible means the multitude of the
[40:10] people and I bought those water were
[40:13] bodies of dead men dead women they were
[40:18] floating upon the waters of judgment so
[40:24] the people that were outside the ark
[40:26] were already dead they all seemed and
[40:30] they all come short from the glory of
[40:33] God they were all dead in sin Ella very
[40:38] queer I hope that why I say put your
[40:41] spiritual jacket are you there to see if
[40:45] the water's were abated from off the
[40:47] face of the ground but the dog found no
[40:51] rest for the sole of her feet the sole
[40:55] of her foot speak of a position if you
[40:59] need a scripture on that brother branham
[41:01] save it you never give a scripture
[41:03] probably if you don't find a scripture
[41:05] see me because our prophet is line up
[41:09] with the Bible there is no way you can
[41:12] separate the message from the Bible
[41:14] there is no argument between the Bible
[41:17] and the message they are together the
[41:21] message was inside the Bible but the
[41:24] message was hidden and it took a prophet
[41:28] to pull the message out of the Bible so
[41:31] you cannot separate the message from the
[41:33] Bible
[41:34] blackball went into the Old Testament
[41:37] and pulled the New Testament from the
[41:39] Old Testament and the message pulled
[41:42] both the new and the Old Testament and
[41:44] pull everything together so there is no
[41:47] way you can contradict that one so the
[41:50] dog have not found a rest for the sole
[41:54] of the foot are you there
[41:56] so the dog was looking for a rest place
[42:00] the dog was looking for a place where
[42:03] she can put a cleanse
[42:07] the sole of the foot so the dog was
[42:13] looking for a place where she can rest
[42:16] and we know the word western speak of
[42:20] the baptism of the holy ghost you know
[42:24] so this bath was looking for a place
[42:27] where she can baptize someone where she
[42:34] can rest on someone she traveled all
[42:38] around but all she could see was dead
[42:41] bodies so there was no one that the dog
[42:45] could claim as a possession and to enter
[42:50] the body everybody clear and she
[42:54] returned to him into the ark for the
[42:57] waters were on the face of the whole
[42:59] earth then he puts forth his head who
[43:03] put forth the hand Noah so when the dog
[43:09] was coming back into the ark Noah reach
[43:13] out his hand everybody listened and the
[43:17] dog sat on the hand of Laura and Noah
[43:21] pulled the dog back into the ark and I'm
[43:25] gonna say that there was a hand that
[43:27] Noah helped to push outside there was a
[43:31] hand and let me call this handle I
[43:35] presume it was and what a Steven the
[43:43] Baba didn't say that you need the
[43:45] Prophet
[43:47] everybody there verse 9 but they don't
[43:51] find no rest for the sole of her foot
[43:52] and she returned to him into the ark for
[43:57] the waters were on the face of the earth
[44:00] so the first ministry of this dog she
[44:03] goes out she was funding for a place to
[44:06] claim there is no place for the claim
[44:08] the dog came back as the dog is coming
[44:11] back Noah pushed his right hand outside
[44:14] and the dog sat on the right hand of
[44:18] Lord and the dog came back into the ark
[44:22] she came into the ark by sitting on the
[44:26] right hand of Noah and he put forth his
[44:32] hand and took her and pull her in to him
[44:35] into the ark and he stayed yet other
[44:38] seven days after this first ministry of
[44:43] the dog Noah have to wait seven days
[44:48] there was a disposition of seven days I
[44:52] have to follow the us into the ark for
[44:59] seven days one two three four five six
[45:02] seven
[45:03] everybody clear hallelujah and again he
[45:08] sent forth the dog out of the ark the
[45:12] dog was sent out of the ark brother of
[45:15] it not on the seventh day but on the day
[45:20] that followed the seventh day which is
[45:23] the eighth day hallelujah
[45:30] with the opening of the seals the barber
[45:34] became a new book are you there
[45:36] and he sent forth the dead they dove out
[45:39] of the ark and the dog came into him in
[45:43] the evening so on the eighth day they
[45:47] dog slept again the ark we have the
[45:50] first coming of the dog where I hear
[45:53] everybody here there is a first coming
[45:56] of the dogs
[45:58] and there is a second coming of the dog
[46:01] into the earth day everybody there and
[46:07] then if you notice on the next verse on
[46:11] the same verse the Bible said the next
[46:14] verse verse 11 the Bible say
[46:16] and the Dove came into him in the
[46:20] evening so the dog must have been left
[46:24] from the ark in the morning the dog was
[46:32] left out of the ark in the morning but
[46:36] they have never came run a quick they
[46:39] have to wait until the evening that came
[46:44] back into the ark so there is a coming
[46:47] back from the outside in the evening
[46:51] time but there is something that
[46:54] happened in the evening with the dog
[46:56] everybody there verse 11 and the dog
[47:00] came in to him in the evening and lo in
[47:03] her mouth was an olive leaves those
[47:07] products so when the dog was left in the
[47:11] morning they dove left the ark on the
[47:14] eighth day that was the morning but on
[47:17] the evening the dogs came back to the
[47:20] ark with an olive leash that means that
[47:24] a dog stooop or stood on all these trees
[47:29] somewhere so there is a ministry of an
[47:32] olive tree that is going to happen with
[47:35] that love'em an olive tree in the Bible
[47:40] means Israel you need a Bible in Vedic
[47:45] Scripture you see me that God left when
[47:48] she left on the eighth day she first
[47:51] left in the morning and she went
[47:54] somewhere where we don't know but after
[47:57] that they both continued and went into
[48:00] an olive tree because the dog heaven
[48:03] industry to finish upon the olive trees
[48:06] and when they finished a ministry upon
[48:09] the olive tree then she planned us a
[48:12] list from an olive tree and the dog went
[48:15] back again to the ark after finishing
[48:18] the ministry of the olive tree not the
[48:22] morning history but evening ministries
[48:25] that she's dealing with Israel before
[48:28] the dog goes back so that dog is coming
[48:31] out going somewhere job to Israel when
[48:35] she finishes then the job comes back
[48:37] again to the ark everybody clear
[48:40] your Bible change now amen so Noah knew
[48:46] that the waters were abated from the UM
[48:50] of the earth verse 12 and he stayed yet
[48:53] other seven days after the coming back
[49:01] into the ark everybody following me they
[49:04] don't stay again Noah stays again seven
[49:09] days there was a disposition of seven
[49:12] days here and there is a second
[49:15] dispensation of the seven days here
[49:18] everybody clear
[49:20] seven days here and the dog was will on
[49:23] the eighth day and no aware that against
[49:26] seven days here and he's gonna send the
[49:29] dog again
[49:31] watch your verse verse 12 and he said
[49:35] yet other seven days and sent forth the
[49:39] dog
[49:40] so that dog again for the third time
[49:43] here was sent on the eighth day let me
[49:50] recapitulate give me my time the first
[49:56] ministry is the weapon rather lofty
[49:59] never came back then the earth was
[50:02] release the dog was looking for a place
[50:05] of claim who puts the sole of her foot
[50:08] and when the Lord a dog came back again
[50:11] glowers stretch up his right hand the
[50:14] box didn't say right hand
[50:16] I am to one okay and then when the
[50:21] opposite he spreads his hand but we need
[50:25] the Prophet to know which hand water are
[50:28] we but I'm saying
[50:30] just by presuming now that it is nor
[50:35] stretch out his right hand
[50:37] they dog sat on the right hand and he
[50:40] pull it back into the Oracle then he
[50:42] waited seven days of a disposition on
[50:45] the and coming up the dog comes down
[50:49] when that dog comes down he dropped down
[50:52] into an olive tree and the evening and
[50:54] when he finished the Ministry of the
[50:57] evening he goes back again to the ark
[50:59] Noah waited against seven other days but
[51:03] on the eighth day he will leave the top
[51:06] again the picture is clear let's go back
[51:10] on verse 12 and he stayed yet other
[51:13] seven days and sent forth the dog which
[51:18] returned not again to him anymore so
[51:22] when the dog was released on the eighth
[51:26] day the dog went forever they both went
[51:31] for eternity there is no more coming of
[51:36] death back to the artist everybody there
[51:40] okay verse 13 and he came to pass in the
[51:45] six hundred and first year in the first
[51:48] month the first day of the mouth the
[51:50] waters were dried up from of the earth
[51:53] and no I removed the covering of the Ark
[51:56] there was a covering of the Ark that no
[51:59] ahead Noah kept that covering this time
[52:03] - after the last release of the dog
[52:08] remove the covering from of the ark he
[52:12] didn't need that covering anymore
[52:14] because the earth was already we knew he
[52:18] was a new earth the first covering the
[52:22] first heaven have to be removed let us
[52:26] sink
[52:28] because it's a new beginning of another
[52:32] day
[52:32] everybody clear of the ark and look and
[52:37] behold the face of the grand was water
[52:39] dry in other words there was no more
[52:42] water there was no more waters there was
[52:46] a new era here a new covering new heaven
[52:50] and there was no more water and no more
[52:53] sea after yesterday it was released and
[52:58] when I was release in this condition
[53:01] then those never came back again into
[53:03] the ark everybody clear so far let's go
[53:06] to first Kings chapter 17 a whole
[53:12] message has been already preached well
[53:17] it David is weather over there praise
[53:20] God you greet him for me first Kings
[53:24] chapter 17 verse 1 I'm begging you to
[53:28] give me my time everybody there and a
[53:34] large added Tish but who was of the
[53:37] inhabitant of Galen say to Arab as the
[53:41] Lord of Israel lives before who must and
[53:43] they shall not be do nor when these
[53:46] years but according to my word and the
[53:49] word of the Lord came to him saying get
[53:52] you from here and turn a sorter new ish
[53:56] word and hide yourself by the brook he
[53:59] carried that is before Jordan and it
[54:03] shall be that you shall drink of the
[54:05] brook and I have commanded the revenge
[54:09] my wife the relevance there is a
[54:15] Ministry of Elijah that is connected to
[54:19] the Ravens he have commander if you
[54:26] notice does have does reven were
[54:29] commended by God they were commended
[54:35] they were under the leadership of God
[54:41] there were ordained by God everybody
[54:46] clear
[54:46] they were ordained by God I have
[54:49] commanded the rhythm to feed you there
[54:53] so we went and did according to the word
[54:57] of the Lord for he went and well by the
[55:00] book carrot that is before Jordan and
[55:03] the revin brought him bread and flesh if
[55:06] you notice the know the diet or the the
[55:11] meal that the Raven brought they brought
[55:15] bread bread is not a dead body as far as
[55:20] somebody who is dying outside but this
[55:23] is a food that is cooked by someone so
[55:29] they doves of Elijah were not even food
[55:39] they have bread and they also have flesh
[55:43] or meat brother branham call it
[55:46] somewhere a sandwich so somebody was
[55:49] cooking somewhere bread and meat a true
[55:54] hamburger everybody there okay flesh in
[55:58] the morning and bread and flesh in the
[56:00] evening they were morning and evening
[56:03] everybody there and he drunk off the
[56:06] brook and he came after he came to pass
[56:09] after a while that the brook dried up
[56:12] because there had been no rain in the
[56:15] land and the word of the Lord came to
[56:18] him saying arras get you to Zarafa
[56:22] Zarafa is not in Israel zurafa is a
[56:27] Gentile place there is an interaction of
[56:31] Elijah with reverence and there is an
[56:34] interaction of Elijah with a Gentile
[56:37] woman with a gentle woman who was a
[56:45] widow verse 9 he was get you to the
[56:49] wafer which belongs to Zion and you are
[56:52] there
[56:53] behold I have done water I have
[56:56] commanded everybody's in there God
[57:00] commended the ravenna and good also
[57:04] commended their we know who man she was
[57:08] a Weedle that means that her first
[57:11] husband died already she was no longer
[57:14] after under the leadership of her first
[57:17] husband because Paul Paul in Romans
[57:21] chapter 7 Paul told us that your first
[57:24] husband must die and you must be married
[57:27] to your second husband
[57:29] are you there so this window already
[57:32] left from under the headship of the
[57:35] first husband everybody did and she was
[57:38] a widow that God commended she was a
[57:42] leader that was under the leadership of
[57:46] God yet she was a Gentile she was
[57:51] married to everybody clear I have
[57:54] commanded a widow woman there to sustain
[57:57] you if we can job to verse 12 and she
[58:02] say everybody there as the Lord your God
[58:06] leaves I have not a cake but a handful
[58:10] of mill in a barrel and a leader all in
[58:13] the crews and behold I am gathering
[58:16] water
[58:17] she is gathering two sticks so this
[58:21] widow woman no headship first husband
[58:25] died we notice also that the Bible say
[58:28] that this woman was connected to two
[58:31] sticks we need to find out what are
[58:34] those two sticks are you there that I
[58:37] may go in and dress it for me and my son
[58:40] that we may eat it and die life
[58:44] scripture let's go to add to chapter 10
[58:46] if you dare you can say Amen add to
[58:51] chapter 10 if I don't do this when I'm
[58:54] traveling you want to be lost quickly
[58:59] add to chapter 10 verse 11 if you dare
[59:04] you can say Amen
[59:08] all right this is Peter who was in his
[59:13] house and Peter got a vision because an
[59:17] angel met a Gentile a Gentile by the
[59:22] name of Cornelius and he sent the people
[59:26] to go and to talk to Peter now verse 11
[59:30] and I saw heaven open these things are
[59:35] coming from heaven okay
[59:37] I saw heaven open and a certain vessel
[59:41] descending to him as he had been a great
[59:45] sheet knit at four corners and led down
[59:49] to the earth wherein all manner of
[59:53] four-footed beasts of the earth and
[59:56] while the beasts so there was a sheet
[1:00:00] that came down from heaven that had
[1:00:03] animals dead and that have wild
[1:00:07] animal not tame animal but that
[1:00:13] that came from heaven was filled with
[1:00:17] wild animal world animal world beast
[1:00:26] verse 12 and creeping things and fowls
[1:00:30] of the air so the force of the earth
[1:00:36] were also in this sheet that came down
[1:00:41] from heaven
[1:00:44] everybody did they tell you what
[1:00:47] category of falls so I can assume that
[1:00:51] somehow here the crow or the Raven was
[1:00:56] undone from heaven and we are verse 13
[1:01:05] and there came a voice to him saying
[1:01:08] rise to him Roz Peter kill and eat but
[1:01:13] Peter say not so Lord for I have never
[1:01:16] eaten anything that is wake up please
[1:01:21] that is common all so these things that
[1:01:24] came out of heaven where unclean unclean
[1:01:30] this wild beast unclean thousand winter
[1:01:36] Raven is an unclean foul
[1:01:43] Riven from the Ark of Noah Raven dealing
[1:01:49] with Elijah Gentile with an unclean from
[1:01:54] heaven everybody there this was done
[1:01:58] twice and the vessel was receive up to
[1:02:01] oh no verse 15 and the voice spoke to
[1:02:05] him again the second time what God has
[1:02:09] cleans da call not you common when
[1:02:14] people look because he was a Jew Peter
[1:02:18] could distinguish the clean animal
[1:02:21] according to the Book of Leviticus and
[1:02:23] the unclean animal but when Peter was
[1:02:27] looking Peter said this category is an
[1:02:31] unclean category I do I am forbidden by
[1:02:35] the law to eat unclean animal but God
[1:02:39] corrected the breeder and say that God
[1:02:43] the animal on the that are
[1:02:46] dropping down for heaven this category
[1:02:49] here are not unclean as you think they
[1:02:53] are clean by God are you there this is a
[1:02:57] raven right here but this raven is under
[1:03:01] the command of god this is a gentle
[1:03:04] woman here this gentle woman is under
[1:03:07] the command of god these are unclean
[1:03:10] beasts to the normal eye but these are
[1:03:13] clean beasts has been cleaned by god
[1:03:15] they are not
[1:03:16] anymore everybody there verse 28 if you
[1:03:22] can drop down and he said to them you
[1:03:26] know how that is an Olaf ooh think for a
[1:03:30] man that is a Jew this is the law now to
[1:03:34] keep company or to come to one of
[1:03:38] another nation are there either is
[1:03:43] explaining and you cannot have
[1:03:45] fellowship with a gentle period are you
[1:03:49] there
[1:03:49] okay now God show him the Gentile as
[1:03:55] unclean animal but those unclean animal
[1:03:58] are coming down from heaven everybody
[1:04:01] clear okay praise God all come not to
[1:04:06] another nation we own verse 20 but God
[1:04:10] has showed me that I should not call any
[1:04:13] man common or unholy or unclean
[1:04:18] everybody there lets job to verse 34
[1:04:21] that we're going to pray then Peter
[1:04:24] opened his mouth and say of a truth I
[1:04:28] perceive that God is no respecter - a
[1:04:32] person a leader of person but in every
[1:04:36] nation they were teaching them that it
[1:04:40] was not only to the Jewish nation that
[1:04:43] God was dealing only with the Jews but
[1:04:46] God also deal with gentle you know in
[1:04:51] every nation either that feed the fears
[1:04:55] him and work righteousness is accepted
[1:04:59] to him in the eyes of Peter you will
[1:05:02] remain a gentle in the eyes of Peter you
[1:05:06] will remain an American in the eyes of
[1:05:09] Peter you will remain a Congolese in the
[1:05:12] eyes of Peter you want to imagine but in
[1:05:15] the eyes of God you are no longer
[1:05:18] in the eyes of God you are no more
[1:05:21] African in the eyes of God you are no
[1:05:24] more Canadian and God don't pee they
[1:05:26] don't look on the outside because I
[1:05:29] already clean those people and is a
[1:05:31] different category of people altogether
[1:05:33] and that category is Gentiles
[1:05:37] let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we thank
[1:05:40] you for your grace your love and your
[1:05:42] mercy for giving us another opportunity
[1:05:45] to gather together around your word
[1:05:47] father we are committing this service
[1:05:50] unto the hand menu remove every weakness
[1:05:53] Lord every weary spirit Lord every
[1:05:56] spirit Lord father that is putting
[1:05:59] people under pressure Lord may we will

[1:06:17] work in the midst of us this morning for
[1:06:19] those who are present here even for
[1:06:21] those who are on the online virtual Lord
[1:06:24] father be deified the Omega of this
[1:06:27] service in the name of Jesus Christ amen
[1:06:30] god bless you and then we are on part 9
[1:06:34] of our team the unchanging pattern of
[1:06:40] God oh brother Branham say that in the
[1:06:43] handwriting on the wall that's brother
[1:06:47] Branham said that but any and now any
[1:06:51] Bible reader here knows that all
[1:06:55] scripture have a compound meaning every
[1:06:59] prophecy some most of it has a dual to a
[1:07:06] time there or two terms or more are
[1:07:11] there sometimes a scripture can mean one
[1:07:15] thing sometimes scripture can be applied
[1:07:18] twice or sometimes a scripture can be
[1:07:21] applied multiple times
[1:07:23] means different things two terms or more
[1:07:27] that it shall be answered as a revolving
[1:07:31] of history in other world history
[1:07:34] repeats itself something that was
[1:07:37] applied to Israel might be applied today
[1:07:40] to the Gentile everybody clear in a
[1:07:43] message this day the scripture is
[1:07:45] fulfilled by random say history always
[1:07:49] repeat itself and a scripture has a
[1:07:52] compound meaning to it and a compound
[1:07:56] revelation so a scripture can mean one
[1:08:00] thing here and you can take the same
[1:08:02] scripture and it means something
[1:08:04] different that's why a preacher can
[1:08:07] stand on this pulpit he can use a
[1:08:10] scripture and preach a message and
[1:08:12] another preacher comes after him he uses
[1:08:15] that same Scripture and preached a
[1:08:18] totally different message because every
[1:08:22] scripture have a compound meaning
[1:08:24] everybody clear so far so last week we
[1:08:28] establish the process of horrible
[1:08:30] because we are dealing with Malachi 4 it
[1:08:34] was easier for you to go to Malachi 4
[1:08:36] and to begin to read this is the day the
[1:08:39] Lord will burn the Lord will do this the
[1:08:42] Sun of righteousness and then remember
[1:08:44] Moses in Horeb
[1:08:45] but today when you go back to Malachi 4
[1:08:48] when you begin to read those chapter
[1:08:51] they begin to make different to you when
[1:08:54] you begin to look at the Sun of
[1:08:56] righteousness
[1:08:56] you know remains when you begin to look
[1:08:59] at remember my servant Moses in or Horeb
[1:09:02] the way you looked at her before is
[1:09:06] completely different than the way you
[1:09:08] are looking at Horeb today and then when
[1:09:12] we looked at Horeb we found out that
[1:09:15] there were two prophet Tower in Horeb
[1:09:17] and we have been dealing with this
[1:09:20] prophet back and forth Moses and Elijah
[1:09:23] Moses and Elijah Moses and Elijah modern
[1:09:27] Moses modern Elijah so when we looked at
[1:09:31] Moses in a horrible we found out that
[1:09:33] the
[1:09:34] three point that we pull from orab Auto
[1:09:37] Moses the first point we found out that
[1:09:40] they were the table of the law that were
[1:09:43] given first to Moses and brother branham
[1:09:46] explained to us under the vision of
[1:09:48] junior Jackson that door table of law
[1:09:51] represented the Bible and then we found
[1:09:54] out that there was a second table of law
[1:09:56] that was given to Moses and brother
[1:09:59] Branham explained to us under the vision
[1:10:01] of genetics on that's that second table
[1:10:03] of law that did not have riding on it
[1:10:06] was the revelation of the seals that
[1:10:09] were locking the entire Bible and then
[1:10:12] the third point was that
[1:10:14] brotherbrother were the words that in
[1:10:16] Horeb God established a law with Israel
[1:10:20] and God showed to Israel that from this
[1:10:23] day forward any time I want to talk to
[1:10:26] my people I will use a prophet so we
[1:10:30] found out that spoke that spoke of the
[1:10:33] ministry that happened on Sunset
[1:10:36] Mountain on Sunset Mountain because on
[1:10:40] Sunset Mountain the blaster came there
[1:10:42] because Sunset mountain was connected to
[1:10:46] the revelation of the Seventh Seal and
[1:10:49] we found out that they are folding of
[1:10:52] the sixth seal and the seven shall
[1:10:54] require a prophet that's why before God
[1:10:59] say I will send you Elijah the prophet
[1:11:01] God first they have to tell you remember
[1:11:05] horrible
[1:11:06] remember what happened to Horeb and then
[1:11:09] I'm gonna send you Elijah the prophet
[1:11:12] because it's a ministry that will
[1:11:14] require prophet everybody clear
[1:11:17] then from there on we found out that
[1:11:20] when that ministry came out we found out
[1:11:23] that the second table of the law were
[1:11:25] not different than the first table of
[1:11:28] the law this has to make sure that the
[1:11:32] second table of the law has to line up
[1:11:35] with the first table of the law that's
[1:11:37] why we say that you cannot separate the
[1:11:40] message from the Bible
[1:11:41] because the message is completely line
[1:11:45] up with the duck whoa everybody fear he
[1:11:48] was written in your Bible the second
[1:11:50] person that we saw in Oran was Elijah
[1:11:53] and then Elijah revealed to us in Horeb
[1:11:56] that it was a kiss so speaking that if
[1:12:00] Elijah come in the end time we must be a
[1:12:02] man we must see a man that is connected
[1:12:05] with a cave then the second part of
[1:12:08] Elijah's ministry in Horeb was connected
[1:12:11] with a sequence of five element number
[1:12:15] one there was a whirlwind that came from
[1:12:17] heaven number two there was rocks that
[1:12:20] came out of it number three there was an
[1:12:22] earthquake that followed that number
[1:12:25] four they was fired at him off and then
[1:12:27] number five they also is still small
[1:12:30] force at the voice of the seventh angel
[1:12:33] the voice of the seventh angel when he
[1:12:36] shall begin to sound or the meaning of
[1:12:39] the mystery of God must be we feel and
[1:12:42] we found that this all happened in
[1:12:45] Sunset Mountain when the angel came and
[1:12:49] visited brother Branham everybody clear
[1:12:52] but does the same Mountain which is
[1:12:56] Sunset mountain this event happened
[1:12:59] twice that was the first time in the
[1:13:02] second term when the event happened
[1:13:04] brother Branham says here he says that
[1:13:07] right beside a great Canyon eight or ten
[1:13:11] times higher than this building it is a
[1:13:13] box canyon like a fire we see fire again
[1:13:18] here everybody come down from heaven
[1:13:21] like a whirlwind we see again a
[1:13:24] whirlwind coming down here just a few
[1:13:27] feet above where I was standing this is
[1:13:29] the second time are you there
[1:13:32] because every word must be established
[1:13:34] with two or three witness everybody
[1:13:37] there so he says and rip the rocks the
[1:13:41] rock again popping up with the rocks
[1:13:44] right out of the mountain went through
[1:13:47] and cut the top of the mesquite trees of
[1:13:50] a four hundred yards out everybody is
[1:13:53] running trying to get
[1:13:55] the truck and everything else he went
[1:13:58] back up again and club like a great
[1:14:01] thunder so this the first Thunder that
[1:14:04] came up with the seven angels one panda
[1:14:08] and seven and jokin but this time it was
[1:14:11] three thunders that thundered one to
[1:14:14] return but the same event again happen
[1:14:18] under sunset multi you know what wanna
[1:14:22] say went back up to the sky again and
[1:14:25] came down again is on that three times
[1:14:29] and he went wall over any world and when
[1:14:33] he was all over they come over and asked
[1:14:37] what did he mean in another message when
[1:14:39] they asked brother Branham worried evil
[1:14:41] brother branham gave the voice behind no
[1:14:45] standard random say immense judgment was
[1:14:49] striking the worst code in other words
[1:14:52] brother branham have an ability to
[1:14:55] understand the Thunder of God you need
[1:14:59] the Prophet who can listen to the
[1:15:02] Thunder but is not hearing noises but
[1:15:05] he's living the voice of God speaking
[1:15:08] under the Thunder are you there and he
[1:15:13] say I say I don't want to tell you
[1:15:15] please allow me Tom don't be too quick
[1:15:18] we are loaded here I don't want to tell
[1:15:22] you he was a judgment son in a few days
[1:15:27] a great earthquake you have your fire
[1:15:30] you have your whirlwind you have your
[1:15:33] work and you have an earthquake who is
[1:15:37] going to strike on western and he won't
[1:15:40] stop California Los Angeles will see
[1:15:44] it's going down
[1:15:46] she shall slide right into the ocean and
[1:15:49] two days after that the Alaskan
[1:15:52] earthquake shook Alaska so we found the
[1:15:56] fire there were when we fire the rock
[1:15:59] rolling down and we found that the other
[1:16:02] that came out under the Thunder and we
[1:16:05] also find out that there was an
[1:16:07] earthquake that shook but if you notice
[1:16:09] here
[1:16:10] brahmam is connecting that earthquake
[1:16:13] with the earthquake of Los Angeles if
[1:16:16] you study this which I don't want to get
[1:16:19] deeper here because I'm going to take
[1:16:21] three hours if you study this you gonna
[1:16:24] find out that their voice spoke to
[1:16:26] brother Branham to pick up a rock and to
[1:16:30] shoot the rock into the air why is
[1:16:33] brother branham's shooting a rock into
[1:16:36] the air and when he shoot the rock into
[1:16:39] the air but when I'm saying that was a
[1:16:41] judgment sign that struck Alaska my
[1:16:45] brother branham is telling you here that
[1:16:47] the Sun became of look he knew a cascade
[1:16:51] later on and we'll heat also Los Angeles
[1:16:55] and seek Los Angeles but later on we
[1:16:58] wanna see why brother branham have to
[1:17:00] pour something in the air because if you
[1:17:04] study the book of Revelation you'll find
[1:17:06] out that the seven angel which have the
[1:17:09] seven vowels pour his vial into the air
[1:17:12] are you there

[1:17:56] trees off about three or four feet above
[1:17:59] my head meant three blasts we just wear

[1:23:47] sent to forerun the first coming your
[1:23:50] message will fall on the second coming
[1:23:52] he says that is the old Hebrew symbol of
[1:23:57] God in the truth Trinitarian way that he
[1:24:01] is not true God but three manifestations
[1:24:05] of the same God Father Son and Holy
[1:24:09] Spirit the light is one complete circle
[1:24:12] of life in a triangle shape which means
[1:24:17] that God will dwell in three offices the
[1:24:20] fatherhood sonship and Holy Ghost
[1:24:23] dispossession are the same God now let

[1:25:01] Mountain if you look at this light right
[1:25:04] here is exactly what happened in South
[1:25:07] Mountain what happened is they never
[1:25:40] knew they have the face of God in them
[1:25:43] it took the Ministry of brother Branham
[1:25:46] to reproduce the light in the cloud and
[1:25:50] when they change the angle of the light
[1:25:53] to the right he pull the first of the
[1:25:56] Hebrew God digi of the Old Testament is
[1:26:00] Jesus Christ of the New Testament you
[1:26:06] gonna find yourself one day you have
[1:26:09] blaspheme the Holy Ghost by attacking
[1:26:13] this picture as we getting down in our
[1:26:16] subject this morning

[1:26:41] of God 930 years before this man drew
[1:26:45] and put it there
[1:26:46] but in the sky he was not
[1:26:48] pranam Joey himself confirmed this
[1:26:52] message that you hope of the Old
[1:26:54] Testament is Jesus car of the New
[1:26:57] Testament the same yesterday today and
[1:27:00] forever his brother Robert still alive
[1:27:07] in pres garden with Elijah comes after
[1:27:14] which a seat belt with brother Branham
[1:27:18] say all right remember yet future now he
[1:27:22] could not have bring the coming of God
[1:27:24] he was the Elijah but he comes first and
[1:27:29] Jesus ji j esus faith grace see five is
[1:27:36] the number of grace Elijah makes five
[1:27:39] appearance one Tom is Raja
[1:27:44] then as relation number two number three
[1:27:48] as John number four at the end of gentle
[1:27:57] gentle
[1:27:59] where is a base where is the foundation
[1:28:04] in the Bible that show us an interaction
[1:28:08] of villages with gentle people are you
[1:28:13] there and also with Moses to the Jews
[1:28:19] perfect number the perfect prophet the
[1:28:24] perfect messenger Stern both under the
[1:28:28] feet zero notice this men are kept alive
[1:28:31] by God from the original ministry for
[1:28:34] future service they serve it so well see
[1:28:38] just think the spirit of Elijah
[1:28:41] ministers fast and Moses to what keep
[1:28:47] for father further services the first
[1:28:52] time Elijah himself the second time
[1:28:55] Elijah who received
[1:28:57] Menten of elijah the tectum John the
[1:29:01] Baptist the fourth time we don't know
[1:29:04] yet
[1:29:05] we presuming they fast the system Elijah
[1:29:09] back again with Moses because I have to
[1:29:13] talk to them about the law but if you
[1:29:16] notice
[1:29:16] Elijah himself Elijah himself was a Jew
[1:29:20] in Israel Elijah was a Jew in Israel
[1:29:26] John the Baptist was a Jew in Israel
[1:29:30] Moses and Elijah Jews in Israel but this
[1:29:34] one brother Branham says he's a jackass
[1:29:37] why what is the base I'll then first
[1:29:45] Timothy chapter 4 now the spirit
[1:29:48] speaketh expressly that in the latter
[1:29:50] times some shall depart from the faith
[1:29:54] so now I'm going to take the first
[1:29:56] compound when we finish dealing with
[1:29:59] that then at Remagen differently
[1:30:01] you know it says job shall depart from
[1:30:05] the faith when you depart from the faith
[1:30:08] that means that you will pay you will
[1:30:13] under this day you were under the
[1:30:16] effects but something happened that
[1:30:19] caused you to leave the faith and to
[1:30:22] deport everybody giving heed to seducing
[1:30:25] spirits and doctrines of devils verse 2
[1:30:30] brother Greg and speaking lies in
[1:30:33] hypocrisy when somebody begin to depart
[1:30:37] from faith you going to see a sign of
[1:30:40] life son of hypocrisy are you dead
[1:30:45] they're coming anointing of lives and an
[1:30:49] anointing of hypocrisy we're jumping to
[1:30:52] that compression
[1:30:54] why because having their conscience
[1:30:56] seared it's already sealed with an iron
[1:31:00] or hot continuing second core entity of
[1:31:05] the 13 verse 5 he said exam
[1:31:08] yourself whether you be in the face
[1:31:12] I then prove your own self no you're not
[1:31:18] your own self you don't know yourself
[1:31:19] you know what you're doing how that
[1:31:22] Jesus Christ is in you except you be
[1:31:25] help Robyn vertebral explained the
[1:31:28] scripture under the second seal he said
[1:31:30] the spirit speak expressing ly that in
[1:31:33] the last time they depart from the faith
[1:31:37] and will give him to seduce to know what
[1:31:42] sent you seducing spirits in the church
[1:31:46] that is clergy that is preachers that is
[1:31:51] preachers
[1:31:53] you know seducing clergy spirit workings
[1:31:58] of devil in the church because they have
[1:32:05] departed so that's why when we look at
[1:32:10] our scripture with power we found out
[1:32:13] that the crew was inside the ark was in
[1:32:18] the message of North Crow was living
[1:32:21] inside the message
[1:32:23] the crowd was evening they blew the food
[1:32:26] of Noah something happened to this crow
[1:32:29] that the crowd departed from Noah and
[1:32:32] the crew went outside because the window
[1:32:36] was open
[1:32:37] because the metal net window was open
[1:32:40] because the internet window was open a
[1:32:43] quasi web site was open that window
[1:32:47] won't happen and because of that crazy
[1:32:50] web site Republican to depart from the
[1:32:53] Lord when we look at the chrome but
[1:32:59] watch you see the son of Ravan on the
[1:33:01] road what is a crow let's look at

[1:36:36] the earth forty days and forty nights
[1:36:39] you remember those number last week and
[1:36:41] every living substance that I have made
[1:36:44] will I destroy from off the face of the
[1:36:47] earth so clearly you found out here
[1:36:50] that's the revenue unclean bird I'm
[1:36:53] going with one compound first it's
[1:36:56] running it's a it's an unclean bird and
[1:37:00] we found out that despite the fact that
[1:37:03] he was an unclean the Raven has been
[1:37:06] given opportunity to enter into the Ark
[1:37:10] of Noah but yet even though he staged so
[1:37:13] long toward the end before the depart
[1:37:18] from the ark something happened and we
[1:37:21] know open up to let the Dove the crow
[1:37:26] graça brother Branham said now the
[1:37:29] animal dove was represented in the ark
[1:37:33] the ark in the ark all species was there
[1:37:37] and they dove and then
[1:37:40] we're there but the lab was on one floor
[1:37:43] I can prove this by the scripture or you
[1:37:46] go read your Bible and the dog was on
[1:37:48] another that was the second level and
[1:37:50] the birthday bird and thousand but in
[1:37:54] the ark set the dog and the crew and all
[1:37:58] the other they said closer together
[1:38:02] perhaps there were twins into the ark
[1:38:07] are they the zodiac spoke to the Gemina
[1:38:12] then in the ark we found the crew and a
[1:38:16] dog we found Cain and Abel we found in
[1:38:20] straw and Jacob and the crew was also
[1:38:23] under the ministry of Noah and window
[1:38:27] open up then the true color of this
[1:38:31] shows up are we there and he says and a
[1:38:36] crow in the Bible is a scavenger each
[1:38:44] [Music]
[1:38:46] denomination they are already expired
[1:38:58] that's one day Krakow is after that's
[1:39:02] why a preacher in the message cannot
[1:39:05] stand on YouTube and watching TV Jason
[1:39:09] reading the other people book and green
[1:39:12] TD jakes message in the message he was
[1:39:20] good in the time of return he was good
[1:39:23] in the time of Wesley he was good at the
[1:39:26] beginning of Pentecost but it's not our
[1:39:29] food today it is an expired Lana
[1:39:33] it is a mama that have mothers and the
[1:39:37] crew is the one eating the market
[1:39:43] additional research history under the
[1:39:47] message but a column said he is the
[1:39:50] meanest bird that's why people are so
[1:39:55] mean in the message they can do
[1:39:59] something wrong and yet they are in the
[1:40:01] message and you found this reason in
[1:40:04] preachers reven I know yet a long life
[1:40:17] fellow they don't die quickly
[1:40:19] you know he's a hypocrite in the message
[1:40:24] where they love you but they don't love
[1:40:27] you they are destroying you on the back
[1:40:30] because you don't fit the agenda the
[1:40:36] cruel under the yoke brother branham
[1:40:39] self scavenger mintzberg hypocrite under
[1:40:45] the message even in the orc the world's
[1:40:48] leaders and the crew in New York both
[1:40:52] members both of them could fly they are
[1:40:56] anointed Varanasi you know the crow is a
[1:41:00] hypocrite he is just a body hypocrite
[1:41:05] now a crock and sat down over there and
[1:41:08] on an old dead horse and just eaten cow
[1:41:13] and flap his wings and have returns but
[1:41:18] the crew can sit there and eat dead
[1:41:21] horses a half a day go out in the field
[1:41:25] and come home and eat dinner with with
[1:41:28] he can eat food from Prasad you know he
[1:41:32] is an appropriate is all did you ever
[1:41:35] notice a dog has no goal of business
[1:41:39] neither does anyone that is baptized
[1:41:43] with the Holy Ghost
[1:41:46] Oh the Builder life is gone away
[1:41:50] people in the message so bidder
[1:41:53] they have grantees for 10 years 12 years
[1:41:57] and they are still proclaiming believing
[1:42:00] the message like a hypocrite the
[1:42:03] hypocrite and the real believer in the
[1:42:06] same church and very clear in the same
[1:42:11] church same denomination setting
[1:42:14] together same pew setting together under
[1:42:19] the message but this bomb a window is
[1:42:23] already open we want to see your true
[1:42:26] colors are you there this is not the
[1:42:29] time you wanna linger anymore the
[1:42:31] biggest hypocrite there is in the world
[1:42:33] is a crow and dove and the crow
[1:42:37] they set on the same pole perhaps in New
[1:42:41] York now the dog can only eat one kind
[1:42:44] of food because it dove is one bird who
[1:42:48] does not have a God he can digest
[1:42:51] rotten things it will born again scent
[1:42:55] of God does not have anything to do with
[1:42:59] the things of the world because he has
[1:43:03] not got any go anymore he does not go
[1:43:07] around fussing with a chip on his
[1:43:10] shoulder wanting to debate and argue
[1:43:14] about something how many times you seen
[1:43:17] people in the message argue all the time
[1:43:24] the unbeliever can believe it so now if
[1:43:28] anybody want to argue about the serpent
[1:43:31] see the things and you try to show them
[1:43:33] they won't listen to it just work away
[1:43:38] that's why Jesus said you can receive it
[1:43:42] this is a logic that was spoken in a
[1:43:46] bubble are you there just leave them
[1:43:49] alone see God don't argue
[1:43:53] neither does his children are you
[1:43:58] for his god brother branham continued
[1:44:01] here he say oh yes he sat on the same
[1:44:04] rooster day with the dog they both sit
[1:44:07] in the same host but one he turned they
[1:44:11] all crow out speaking about Noah I
[1:44:14] imagine all the waters was thinking with
[1:44:18] millions of people swelled bodies
[1:44:21] rotating upon the water and washes and
[1:44:25] animals all day the whole world was
[1:44:28] destroyed and there there was this all
[1:44:31] dead carcasses falling on top of the
[1:44:34] order and things like that and the
[1:44:37] old-growth through them
[1:44:38] a not grown in or dead body
[1:44:41] my just fine that's good see eating a
[1:44:45] dead body
[1:44:47] why that was his nature
[1:44:51] how can you live the message today and
[1:44:54] tomorrow we're insured you will all this
[1:44:58] time why that was his nature he was a
[1:45:11] cruel no matter how much his sack with
[1:45:15] the dog then how much he heard Noah
[1:45:19] preached he was under the message he was
[1:45:24] listening to the message our this year
[1:45:27] twenty years ten years and one of this
[1:45:30] day they will come a falling away we
[1:45:33] will open up the crew will have to leave
[1:45:37] are you there no matter how much he
[1:45:42] heard Noah preached how much he said
[1:45:44] with discrete world they thought he was
[1:45:48] a quote to begin with as soon as he got
[1:45:52] the opportunity to show his colors he
[1:45:56] shouted don't be surprised
[1:45:59] oh no oh this time he never believed
[1:46:03] them
[1:46:05] now but when we turn the dogs out when
[1:46:09] she started out whoo she could not stand
[1:46:12] up they can give you a message you
[1:46:14] listen you say you know what turned a
[1:46:16] message of I don't need to finish even
[1:46:18] that one I don't even need to waste my
[1:46:20] time and listening to that this is not
[1:46:23] my food this is the food of the
[1:46:25] denomination it's not our food no way
[1:46:29] she could go she could not find no rest
[1:46:32] for the sole of her feet so she came
[1:46:34] back to the earth and that's the waiting
[1:46:36] sometimes you might be turned loose for
[1:46:40] a little while
[1:46:40] to see what you will do but you always
[1:46:44] if you got the nature of a dog you
[1:46:47] cannot eat food it's the nature so my
[1:46:53] brother when the dog
[1:46:56] brother branham say dead body work salty
[1:46:59] on the water so he found food that he
[1:47:01] can feast on but if he was still under
[1:47:04] this condition you need a universe not
[1:47:11] what you are trying to impersonate them
[1:47:13] if you are you are still a crow you find
[1:47:17] yourself me you find yourself eating
[1:47:21] dead food you'll find yourself hypocrisy
[1:47:24] you find yourself aren't you all the
[1:47:27] time
[1:47:27] you find yourself on the telephone if
[1:47:30] you notice cross it on the telephone
[1:47:33] line
[1:47:34] they always hello hello they know what
[1:47:37] happened to church so and so they know
[1:47:39] what happened to church so and so they
[1:47:41] know happened teacher some of the
[1:47:43] message believe I like CNN if you want
[1:47:46] to know what happened in the message
[1:47:48] just get in contact with them
[1:47:51] they are sitting on the telephone pole
[1:47:53] that's where they eat watching for dead
[1:47:56] food from the pulpit all the way to the
[1:48:04] last few even preachers Deacon trust is
[1:48:09] right everybody you got to get your
[1:48:15] natural change
[1:48:17] to make your desires change then how can
[1:48:22] you do something wrong and you are happy
[1:48:25] and you claim you believe the message
[1:48:29] you tell a lie you are mean for 3ma
[1:48:33] and you go to sleep and you wake up and
[1:48:36] your conscience is good you learn to
[1:48:39] people your conscience is good timotei
[1:48:42] told us they got their conscious theory
[1:48:47] the Bible said godly sorrow bring them
[1:48:51] to repentance you do something wrong to
[1:48:53] somebody and yet you continue then when
[1:49:00] you truly love God and we here believe
[1:49:03] him with all your heart when you do
[1:49:06] anything wrong you feel the tears of
[1:49:09] repentance rolling down your cheek you
[1:49:12] can't stand it that's the nature of a
[1:49:16] child of God either you have to go back
[1:49:24] did wrong sister I did wrong but you
[1:49:28] fans people men under political
[1:49:31] anointing political agenda under grudges
[1:49:36] under jealousy under backbiting and then
[1:49:40] still claim to being a message a message
[1:49:44] you are equal you need your natural
[1:49:47] change hallelujah you have to go back
[1:49:54] you lay on your face before God and say
[1:49:58] God you know I didn't mean to do that
[1:50:00] and you shall stay right here until it
[1:50:03] settle with God forever that's right
[1:50:09] everybody there and the man that is born
[1:50:13] of the Spirit of God becomes a love of
[1:50:17] God now say gods that are born of God
[1:50:21] become a new creature we are friends
[1:50:28] you are still American on the outside
[1:50:30] but on the inside your head corner is
[1:50:34] heaven you are African on the outside
[1:50:37] you are you know plain on the outside
[1:50:39] but on the inside you come from God
[1:50:44] hallelujah his natural he's changed his
[1:50:49] makeup yes sir you put the spirit of
[1:50:53] Adolfo in the crew the outside women you
[1:50:57] want to still be a white man you want to
[1:50:59] still be a black line you want to still
[1:51:02] be a panic mode you want to still be
[1:51:04] whoever you want to call it you still do
[1:51:06] but the inside the we are same that's
[1:51:10] why we can fellowship together because
[1:51:12] we come now from the same father then he
[1:51:16] never sat on the dead carcass why that
[1:51:20] crew don't anymore on dead carcass the
[1:51:24] crew doesn't set any more on dead
[1:51:27] carcass because his nature has been
[1:51:30] changed today if he lived down by
[1:51:36] mistake
[1:51:36] because the body has now received
[1:51:39] redemption yet if by any chance you make
[1:51:42] a mistake
[1:51:43] whatever him say he certainly get away
[1:51:46] quick quick to be mouth before you ask
[1:51:54] forgiveness five years before you ask
[1:51:59] forgiveness the Bible said that Jesus
[1:52:03] loved righteousness and hated iniquity
[1:52:08] therefore I have elevated you above your
[1:52:12] brother they can not do something wrong
[1:52:15] to somebody and you are happy he shows
[1:52:18] that what is in you is wrong get away
[1:52:25] quick he could not stand a man that is
[1:52:30] born of the Spirit of God during
[1:52:32] tolerance he might light in a barrel
[1:52:36] some time but he said get there who
[1:52:39] oh my god a woman my touch him get him
[1:52:45] to turn around but he said turn his head
[1:52:48] again

[1:52:52] not enjoy enjoy enjoy enjoy until that
[1:52:57] woman kick you out when you come for
[1:53:00] repentance
[1:53:05] Joseph run away you know why he is a dog
[1:53:13] you aren't going to fool him because
[1:53:17] that he knows my sheep know my voice and
[1:53:20] a stranger they will not follow he is a
[1:53:22] dog to begin with there is what we are
[1:53:25] speaking about the actual is something
[1:53:27] that anchor in there
[1:53:29] if we believe his word then we shall
[1:53:32] believe we shall live by his word it's
[1:53:35] our duty if we have a met God not
[1:53:38] because you say well I go to church I've
[1:53:41] got to do this you are miserable don't
[1:53:44] do that why do you want to be a
[1:53:47] miserable they quipped ungodly cruel for
[1:53:53] when you could be a Gulf there is a
[1:53:57] possibility for you to change and yet
[1:54:00] you don't want to change you want to
[1:54:02] continue doing bad stuff certainly you
[1:54:07] just have to have your nature change and
[1:54:10] you change your nature become a son and
[1:54:13] daughter of God be at peace with who
[1:54:16] with God now that was the first aspect
[1:54:20] of the crew now let's turn our God
[1:54:24] different because every scripture of a
[1:54:28] compound meeting do you see why
[1:54:30] equivocal now let's change our gun
[1:54:33] differently now if you notice on our
[1:54:36] storage here we found out that Elijah
[1:54:40] was fed by the crew the crew of Elijah
[1:54:44] did not bring rotten food with changing
[1:54:49] guns it is they were not the crew diet
[1:54:53] dead food over here the Bible says they
[1:54:58] were commanded by God they were under
[1:55:03] the leadership of God they were told
[1:55:07] them by God over there and the Bible
[1:55:12] says that both that are the children of
[1:55:15] God are led by the Spirit of God so
[1:55:20] these clothes must have the nature
[1:55:23] already change we are changing direction
[1:55:29] everybody clear they were bringing bread
[1:55:32] and meat fresh food not rotten food
[1:55:38] fresh message the message of the hour
[1:55:42] not the old town message everybody clear
[1:55:47] brother branham help me what did I like
[1:55:51] to do he found a hidden spring way up in
[1:55:55] the mountain where he got some water of
[1:55:57] life we find revelations from God as he
[1:56:02] sit up there under the power of God the
[1:56:05] revelation being in leader hidden spring
[1:56:07] while the rest of them were vanishing
[1:56:12] catch this and God bless his servant why
[1:56:18] did brother Branham call this servant
[1:56:20] and they being closed when you look at
[1:56:24] the scripture
[1:56:26] superficially you come with a
[1:56:29] superficial understanding are you there
[1:56:32] one column said God bless his servants
[1:56:38] reven so they were not the heaven
[1:56:43] delivered with the dirty nature of
[1:56:47] scavenger hypocrite and building he says
[1:56:52] they brought him something to eat while
[1:56:55] he was isolated from the people and they
[1:56:58] were down there publishing furnishing
[1:57:01] for a revival and all go
[1:57:04] everybody was in femine he said they
[1:57:07] didn't know he pulled himself with god
[1:57:10] out into an isolated place where they
[1:57:13] didn't hear his voice
[1:57:14] then they begin to see he ordained
[1:57:18] ordained destinated commanded leadership
[1:57:24] of God he or dam dereference this
[1:57:27] servant members he suffered that kept
[1:57:34] the voice of Elijah a love doing the
[1:57:38] tongue of his oscillations the church so
[1:57:43] there will be some people there will be
[1:57:46] some clothes there will be some gentle
[1:57:49] people and another turn away from the
[1:57:52] message but they're gonna take the
[1:57:54] message of Elijah and keep them false
[1:57:58] off a large I rise brother balance ad
[1:58:07] scroll are his servant if the servant of
[1:58:12] God they are human things if there are
[1:58:18] human being when we see the vision Peter
[1:58:21] we found that that the birds doubles
[1:58:24] over there where unclean birds over here
[1:58:28] and the true in Leviticus was an on
[1:58:32] Twitter so the rules also day so what
[1:58:37] does this mean
[1:58:38] we need a prophet the water but the
[1:58:42] water baptism now then while Peter was
[1:58:46] on has for quantum at some on detainer
[1:58:50] he saw a vision because Cornelius a
[1:58:53] Jetta new remember focus Elijah to Jew
[1:59:02] Jordan is Jew then - we want to find a
[1:59:07] connection in the Ministry of Elijah
[1:59:10] window for the Gentile everybody
[1:59:14] everybody clear because Cornelius and
[1:59:18] Gentiles there is a Jew Samaritan now
[1:59:22] Jacob every oh Jesus dealt with the Jew
[1:59:28] Jesus dealt with the Samaritan now Jesus
[1:59:32] is dealing with their few gentle but
[1:59:36] here okay and Peter was on the housetop
[1:59:41] taking a little nap before dinner
[1:59:43] while they was fixing dinner he seen a
[1:59:46] sheet being lowered down all kind of
[1:59:50] what unclean creeping animals from the
[1:59:55] earth was only if you notice because the
[1:59:58] Holy Spirit's just remind me this now
[2:00:00] if you note it in the Ark of Noah there

[2:00:20] the connection
[2:00:22] okay you just came back or kind of
[2:00:25] unclean could mean animals from the
[2:00:28] earth war zone and then when he did that
[2:00:31] he heard the voice saying rise Peter
[2:00:34] slain it brother brothers say he was a
[2:00:37] good presbyterian where is in the
[2:00:41] scripture you need to see what
[2:00:44] Presbyterian to do then you understand

[2:00:49] are you there okay
[2:00:51] fifty arise elite he says nothing ever
[2:00:55] come in my mouth unclean remember the
[2:01:00] first crow we found out that it's a
[2:01:03] believer that sit under ministry and
[2:01:06] then he left he was not a believer to
[2:01:09] begin with because the Holy Spirit just
[2:01:12] bring back something again to me ran out
[2:01:14] if you notice over and under the same
[2:01:21] roof I'm there now me

[2:01:26] the family but the dam was come come
[2:01:30] that is opportunity was given for both
[2:01:33] of them

[2:01:37] message but Ruth cling on to Naomi and
[2:01:40] Ruth white and she managed both there
[2:01:45] which is a type of crust and when she
[2:01:49] gave birth to each other she did not
[2:01:52] only took the child from roof and then
[2:01:55] begin to nurse her because the seven

[2:02:50] did and one Peter was speaking the Holy
[2:02:53] Ghost fell down and baptized the Delta
[2:02:58] that's why Peter say God have no respect
[2:03:02] for any person we found that Elijah was

[2:03:26] for Tom a window of the Gentiles there
[2:03:29] where he's entertained by the crew by
[2:03:32] human being by the servant of God by the
[2:03:36] judge
[2:03:36] and not only that after this example he
[2:03:41] went to a Gentile country where there
[2:03:44] was a we go again Malachi 4 is not for
[2:03:50] the Gentile it's footage right see why
[2:03:55] we built as we moving are you there
[2:03:58] look at that woman how human must have
[2:04:03] been a fake a Libra Elijah remember the
[2:04:09] Bible say that the woman was commanded
[2:04:13] by God she was under the leadership of
[2:04:17] God just like the Raven under the
[2:04:20] leadership of God that's why brother
[2:04:22] Branham said she must be in a caravan
[2:04:26] she must be illegal to are you there she
[2:04:34] must be thank you some substance brother
[2:04:36] Michael this little woman must have been
[2:04:39] of the calibre of Elijah because you
[2:04:43] chose her I love you brother you don't
[2:04:49] love me let me keep moving and again she
[2:04:58] had been chosen to entertain God's
[2:05:02] prophet remember she was her gentle
[2:05:07] mortal corruption of Raja with the Jetta
[2:05:13] because the father Raja is a gentle and
[2:05:21] the land was burning up and no doubt
[2:05:24] that this little woman bring of that
[2:05:27] calibre bring off death they believed
[2:05:31] her type
[2:05:32] you said she's a gentle she was a
[2:05:35] believer so it would be a Ministry of
[2:05:39] Elijah that's going to go to the Gentile
[2:05:42] believer to the Gentile servant are you
[2:05:48] there
[2:05:49] for we see that God could not have
[2:05:53] called to her if she had not been a
[2:05:56] worthy want to entertain God's prophet
[2:06:00] for he would never send his prophet to a
[2:06:04] house that was unworthy he would never
[2:06:09] say to the house of Cornelius if the
[2:06:13] wives of Cornelius was not worthy the
[2:06:15] Bible said Cornelius was a good lad he
[2:06:19] pray and the angel met him so God said
[2:06:23] that is not a gentle that is my child in
[2:06:27] gentle skin even though they are not
[2:06:30] Jews but they are my children everybody
[2:06:36] he was not his choosing grace he was
[2:06:41] God's choosing he was not your bidding
[2:06:43] him that woman was not the one say
[2:06:45] Elijah come here but God sent her who I
[2:06:50] will send you a large adder I God will
[2:06:54] send you Elijah I God will send you
[2:06:58] Elijah that Elijah is said by God that
[2:07:03] woman did not invite Elijah Elijah will
[2:07:07] be send by God to the Gentile we are
[2:07:14] doing a vaccine it was not her bidding
[2:07:19] him he was God bidding him he had been
[2:07:22] blessed by the book the revenue were
[2:07:25] feeding him but he was God command for
[2:07:28] something to take place and God surely
[2:07:30] went to a believer of the same nature
[2:07:36] Elijah that believer was a Gentile is
[2:07:41] the larger must be of the nature of
[2:07:44] their so that Elijah must be gentle
[2:07:49] that just job right now I didn't CDC
[2:07:53] homie just drop right now
[2:07:55] I dare show your face denied job Jew
[2:08:00] second Atlanta Jew tell Elijah Jew from
[2:08:03] Fallujah Jacob then when we drop on
[2:08:10] Malachi 4 it's clear how we they are we
[2:08:15] there I have part 10 already I have part
[2:08:19] 11 ready now there was a woman in the
[2:08:26] land neither one of these people know
[2:08:28] each other but she must have been an
[2:08:31] honorable woman she must have been the
[2:08:34] type of woman that Elijah was a man
[2:08:37] because God chose a woman and of all the
[2:08:41] women there was even to tell his God
[2:08:47] lest the Jews left the Jews left the
[2:08:53] women of the Jews God went to the death
[2:08:57] woman hallelujah in their own area to
[2:09:04] remember that woman had to stick right
[2:09:08] Vera Pauline catch piss in the entryway
[2:09:12] they use two sticks he was crushed
[2:09:15] crushed right and the fight was in the
[2:09:20] middle the engine still use it and when
[2:09:23] they move the logs happen the cross you
[2:09:29] know Christ I was in leader that sixel
[2:09:36] hidden your judgment of the gentle
[2:09:39] heating rowdy are you there he said
[2:09:42] perfect friend my prophet witness she
[2:09:44] won't talk today morning to pick up two
[2:09:46] sticks and break them just be patient
[2:09:49] with me I felt check but just be present
[2:09:53] and put them together see the truth
[2:09:57] speak is done so this woman is the
[2:10:00] gentle
[2:10:01] and she carry the cross when she meets
[2:10:05] Raja so he takes the classroom to change
[2:10:08] the dispensation from the jewels to the
[2:10:11] Jetta
[2:10:12] that's why while Joseph brings to son
[2:10:16] Jacob have to cross him Jacob was about
[2:10:25] to bless them he crossed his hand so
[2:10:28] that the right hand fell on the younger
[2:10:30] Joseph cried not so father this is the
[2:10:34] firstborn to arise by Jack God cross my
[2:10:38] and here is the last thing which
[2:10:43] belonged to the firstborn the Jews was
[2:10:46] given over to the younger the gentle
[2:10:49] through the cross that's why the
[2:10:52] gentlewoman carried a cross willful
[2:10:55] Elijah you need a prophet through the
[2:11:03] cross cross hand of the Lord Jesus the
[2:11:07] blessing come through the cross
[2:11:08] Galatians 3:13 14 currencies everyone
[2:11:12] that hang on the tree which is the cost
[2:11:14] that's the blessing of Abraham I come to
[2:11:16] the Jetta through Jesus Christ the
[2:11:19] blessing of Abraham came through the
[2:11:21] cross to the gentle that you rejected
[2:11:25] the cross idelle Father forgive them
[2:11:28] they don't know what they're doing and
[2:11:29] then therefore Jesus get the gentle
[2:11:33] breath but I will send you Elijah the
[2:11:36] prophet your first Elijah to second and
[2:11:43] a Jew to the larger Jew fifth one at you
[2:11:47] a fourth one is your Jetta everybody now
[2:11:52] let's head straight to the airport we
[2:11:56] found out that in the first ministry God
[2:11:59] gave us a tap here that is going to be
[2:12:03] visiting the Jetta
[2:12:05] one day that's why Noah a type of first
[2:12:10] of all send the crowd a different
[2:12:13] compound me
[2:12:15] everybody and the only profit that was
[2:12:19] entertained by the crew was Elijah is it
[2:12:28] taking time to catch it is it that in
[2:12:31] time to catch you catch it the first one
[2:12:34] Elijah the first one they send the crew
[2:12:38] and we found the crew ministry when he
[2:12:41] left to heaven the Ark is a type of
[2:12:44] heaven because remember the animal were
[2:12:47] coming from heaven right right the Ark
[2:12:51] is the top of your heaven either so they
[2:12:54] have to send the first ministry of the
[2:12:56] crew to kind of show you that I will
[2:12:59] visit the gentle one time are you there
[2:13:02] are you there then the second ministry
[2:13:06] because the Ministry of the crew happen
[2:13:09] in the Old Testament but before the end
[2:13:12] of the Old Testament John the Baptist
[2:13:14] came and when John was baptizing Jesus
[2:13:17] Christ we found that the bus was
[2:13:21] released from heaven I told you if
[2:13:29] somebody's dying or they love they need
[2:13:32] CPR and we they we are talking about
[2:13:37] heaven where the crew is they send the
[2:13:40] crowd to Allah Old Testament but before
[2:13:43] the end of the Old Testament we see the
[2:13:47] Messiah coming when the Messiah coming
[2:13:50] also happen of no open applicant Noah
[2:13:54] release the dogs
[2:13:55] but this Dharma the first partner the
[2:13:59] dog didn't find any place to claim but
[2:14:02] this time when the dog was relieved he
[2:14:05] found that Jesus Christ and he put claim
[2:14:08] of Jesus Christ and in him dwelleth the
[2:14:11] fullness of the head Godhead
[2:14:15] the body of Jesus they dog finally found
[2:14:18] the rest we clear anybody needs CPR
[2:14:26] remember the Holy Ghost descended on
[2:14:29] Jesus we 12 which Jesus was a part of
[2:14:33] the why the germ of life was they they
[2:14:37] have to quick imagine the life of God
[2:14:39] was desiring the womb of a woman Allah
[2:14:42] with which was the earth all right and
[2:14:46] then the life of God coming so he was
[2:14:49] the beginning the beginning of sending
[2:14:53] the love the beginning of creation of
[2:14:57] God what for to the earth now it's been
[2:15:03] justified it's beautiful and are we
[2:15:09] there and now it has to receive its
[2:15:11] baptism of fire to be cleansed is bright
[2:15:16] these are that is Joe out of the earth
[2:15:21] the earth you are part of the earth your
[2:15:23] body your soul is part of God an
[2:15:26] attribute of God display here on the
[2:15:30] body needs to be rooted deep just like
[2:15:33] the dog have to come in the body of
[2:15:36] Jesus Christ and claim the body of Jesus
[2:15:39] Christ they'd love released the first
[2:15:41] time find a place
[2:15:43] this is my only begotten Son in whom I
[2:15:46] am pleased to dwell because on the Old
[2:15:49] Testament there was dead body dead body
[2:15:51] all have sinned and come short from the
[2:15:54] glory of God but this one is this one I
[2:15:59] can claim him then the dog come and sit
[2:16:03] and when he finished his ministry
[2:16:05] hallelujah when he finished his ministry
[2:16:08] he went back up and then Noah reach out
[2:16:12] and hear each other is right handed
[2:16:15] what did you say and the Bible didn't
[2:16:17] say it brother branham and put what is
[2:16:20] written about moses put the hand in the
[2:16:24] bosom but what this concern now with a
[2:16:27] voice what the hell
[2:16:28] buzu he was talking about Moses we have
[2:16:30] no reason to believe that Moses was
[2:16:32] left-handed so he must have put his
[2:16:35] right hand in his bosom because most men
[2:16:38] huh brother Stephen say my wife say what
[2:16:46] do you normally say this I get so happy
[2:16:50] you know so Noah charity's right-handed
[2:16:54] and what did he do he took the dog back
[2:16:57] again that's why when Jesus Christ came
[2:17:00] when he died he rose again when he went
[2:17:04] to heaven he went to the right hand
[2:17:06] daughters ride the dog back again to
[2:17:13] heaven in the right hand man of God his
[2:17:16] brother Robert still allows the
[2:17:27] development under the Old Testament the
[2:17:30] dogs came in Christ claimed he went back
[2:17:33] again seated in the right hand of God
[2:17:36] was follow the seven churches discipline

[2:19:48] the day of Pentecost will not work this
[2:19:51] day clear no sir that was for pinnacles
[2:19:55] this is the bride with the jesus' that
[2:20:02] we are in this world but we are not
[2:20:05] afterward when you are born again even
[2:20:10] though you are American but your
[2:20:13] lifestyle is no more according to
[2:20:16] America you are living in Egypt but in
[2:20:20] Egypt there was a place called Ocean he
[2:20:24] was still under Odisha still in Egypt
[2:20:27] but separated
[2:20:29] well they believer are there it is an
[2:20:33] edge within an edge which is called
[2:20:36] the bride egg that's why when the angel
[2:20:39] came down he said thou shall be no more
[2:20:42] you are no more quicker of time you

[2:20:55] are not ask the world over there this is
[2:21:03] for the broad going home of the broad we
[2:21:06] got something different that's why our
[2:21:08] message has to be the Pentecostal
[2:21:16] represented that again we are in the
[2:21:19] broad edge you are dead to that and you
[2:21:24] cannot have them we are not living in a
[2:21:27] place Turkish knowledge this is modern
[2:21:29] day we are living in an average weather
[2:21:34] we are laude sure but we are not part of
[2:21:37] that system but we are still in Goshen
[2:21:39] in Egypt we need extra days which is the
[2:21:42] rapture we are living in another age
[2:21:45] since we are not living in a Methodist
[2:21:48] age we are living in another age we are
[2:21:51] living on up here to the bride age
[2:21:54] they're crawling out of the church and
[2:21:57] they getting ready together further so
[2:22:01] Moses take Israel Israel is living in
[2:22:04] Goshen yet Goshen is in Egypt and they
[2:22:08] prepare Israel in Goshen for everybody
[2:22:10] to put the token then they can leave
[2:22:13] Israel Egypt they can go into the
[2:22:16] Promised Land we can leave this world we
[2:22:19] can go into the Roger but before you
[2:22:21] must be gathered into a different age
[2:22:23] you must leave now Isha you must leave
[2:22:26] the system of loudest are you there he
[2:22:29] says here that we are living upon the
[2:22:32] broad age they're calling out of the
[2:22:34] church and getting it together for the
[2:22:36] rapture that is the age we are living on
[2:22:38] now - my honest opinion that is exactly
[2:22:41] the truth so the last days now you see
[2:22:45] it switched on now it's getting harvest
[2:22:48] on this is not Luthor Ange
[2:22:50] this is not Pentecostal age this is the

[2:28:51] on it everything you look at health
[2:28:54] speaker on because there is no other
[2:28:55] because it's so dry that sticker is a
[2:28:58] leaf roll together that's the mystery of
[2:29:01] the cactus okay so tight and so sharp
[2:29:04] there is no instrument could be grounded
[2:29:07] like that no instrument could be ground
[2:29:09] like a jumping cactus the one that kill
