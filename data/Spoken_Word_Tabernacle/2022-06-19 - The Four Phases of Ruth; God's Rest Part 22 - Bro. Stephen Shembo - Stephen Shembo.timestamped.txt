[54:19] because it's blending together i wish i
[54:21] have another father's day message but

[54:33] draw something let's go to chapter 2
[54:36] quick
[54:37] if you dare you can say amen
[54:40] hallelujah
[54:44] ruth chapter 2 verse 14.
[54:48] you already understand this
[54:51] but there is something that uh the lord
[54:54] opened up and i have to add it up so we
[54:57] make sure you got it i don't know who's
[54:59] still struggling in that area so
[55:00] hopefully
[55:02] you will get some clearance this morning
[55:05] amen if you're there you can say amen
[55:07] roof 2 chapter 14
[55:09] and boasts say unto her unto roof
[55:14] at mealtime
[55:15] come you here we know the table of the
[55:17] showbread is open here everybody okay
[55:22] okay
[55:24] and eat
[55:25] of the bread
[55:27] and dip your morsel
[55:29] in the vinegar we already went through
[55:30] this amen
[55:33] and she sat beside the reapers
[55:38] you might be seated
[55:39] so ruth
[55:41] was invited
[55:43] to a table
[55:46] which was seen in the tabernacle
[55:48] was the top of the table of the
[55:50] showbreeder
[55:52] everybody okay
[55:53] because we found out that we had bread
[55:55] there and we also have a drink offering
[55:59] at this time it was vinegar which remind
[56:02] us of what happened at the cross
[56:04] yes
[56:05] you're still up
[56:07] amen but when roof sat at this table
[56:11] this turbo had boasts
[56:16] and boaz was not alone
[56:18] it was a table where boaz and the
[56:21] reapers were together
[56:23] which we know the reapers are the angels
[56:26] the scripture says that we already went
[56:28] through this which are the preachers
[56:32] amen
[56:33] and the top of them was the chief reaper
[56:36] everybody okay
[56:38] so the bible says that
[56:40] and she sat beside the reapers
[56:43] and he boaz
[56:45] reached her her perch corn
[56:48] and she did it and was so fast and
[56:52] left so she sat at the same table
[56:59] everybody okay
[57:00] that's the reapers are eating
[57:03] [Applause]
[57:06] everybody okay
[57:07] in this message we don't have two tables
[57:12] [Music]
[57:13] [Applause]
[57:14] we are not catholics
[57:18] where the priests have a certain food
[57:21] and the congregation are eating a
[57:23] different food
[57:24] you sit at the same table
[57:27] but here you sit with the same table
[57:30] but the one really giving the food
[57:35] he's not the reaper
[57:38] are we okay now
[57:40] roof sat beside the reapers but she's
[57:43] getting food from boas
[57:45] but you must sit beside the reaper
[57:48] and that reaper must sit beside boaz
[57:51] but the food that you are receiving
[57:54] you're not receiving that from a reaper
[57:57] you are receiving that from boaz
[57:59] directly into you
[58:03] so the one feeding you is not the reaper
[58:06] [Music]
[58:07] it is boys
[58:09] but you must be beside the reaper
[58:12] everybody okay so far
[58:15] amen now let's go to verse to chapter
[58:17] three
[58:18] hallelujah
[58:21] keep that in mind
[58:24] ruth chapter 3 verse 1. if you there you
[58:27] can say amen
[58:29] then naomi her mother-in-law say unto
[58:32] her
[58:33] my daughter
[58:35] shall i not seek what
[58:37] you know what it means now
[58:39] right last sunday we seen that rest in
[58:42] the bible means water
[58:47] amen
[58:48] shall i seek rest
[58:51] for you that he may be well with you if
[58:54] you remember this rest was not unveiled
[58:57] in the country of moab
[59:00] and this rest is not you going to your
[59:02] bed to sleep
[59:05] this arrest was connected to marriage
[59:09] you remember
[59:10] it was connected to a covenant
[59:13] he was connected to a wedding
[59:16] he was connected to a union
[59:20] there is a union that happened
[59:23] so when they say union
[59:25] marriage they're talking about the same
[59:27] thing
[59:28] invisible
[59:30] invisible
[59:34] is he complicated
[59:35] is the message complicated
[59:39] amen
[59:40] job to verse
[59:42] 14
[59:44] hallelujah
[59:45] if you're there you can say amen
[59:50] i skip everything because there is a lot
[59:52] of deep stuff hand
[59:55] that are hidden right here
[59:57] so i'm trying to touch the first point
[59:59] then we will go back again and begin to
[1:00:01] follow that amen
[1:00:03] verse

[1:05:16] amen
[1:05:17] how can you doubt what happened there if
[1:05:20] you were not there
[1:05:24] yes
[1:05:27] you can say whatever happened there
[1:05:29] happened
[1:05:31] only the only thing i have i only have
[1:05:33] the sixth measure
[1:05:34] that i can prove to you
[1:05:38] either you believe the sixth measure
[1:05:41] or you just don't want to believe it
[1:05:43] that's your problem
[1:05:44] [Music]
[1:05:47] everybody okay
[1:05:48] verse 16. and when she came to her
[1:05:51] mother-in-law everybody okay
[1:05:53] she said who are you in other words how
[1:05:56] did he go
[1:05:58] my daughter and she told her all that
[1:06:01] the man had done to her everybody okay
[1:06:06] and she said
[1:06:10] these six measures of barley
[1:06:13] gave him me
[1:06:14] for he said to me
[1:06:16] go not empty
[1:06:19] to your mother-in-law
[1:06:21] when boaz was talking to roof
[1:06:25] boaz was telling ruth i'm giving you
[1:06:27] this
[1:06:28] i don't want you to go empty to your
[1:06:29] mother-in-law so when roof was picking
[1:06:32] up the sixth measure of of bali he was
[1:06:34] thinking about naomi in
[1:06:37] connection
[1:06:39] family connection with
[1:06:41] boaz so she was going home saying wow
[1:06:44] this man is very generous he's taking
[1:06:46] care of his family he's worrying about
[1:06:48] his mother-in-law praise god
[1:06:55] amen
[1:06:56] everybody
[1:06:57] it looks like it is coming the gift is
[1:07:00] going toward israel
[1:07:02] [Music]
[1:07:06] are you are you understanding me
[1:07:10] there is a reason why revelation 10.
[1:07:14] must be before revelation 11.
[1:07:17] [Music]
[1:07:20] brother branham said christ is the
[1:07:22] messenger to israel
[1:07:26] you okay but before he dropped to israel
[1:07:31] revelation 10 is pulling him out here
[1:07:39] the sixth measure of barley were given
[1:07:42] to roof
[1:07:44] okay
[1:07:45] and they were given to roof like
[1:07:48] they belong to naomi
[1:07:52] everybody okay
[1:07:54] one day belongs to naomi it is called
[1:07:56] trumpet
[1:08:01] we okay now
[1:08:02] when they belong to roof it is called
[1:08:04] seal
[1:08:08] [Music]
[1:08:10] so when roof takes it it's a seal when
[1:08:12] it goes to naomi it's a trumpet
[1:08:15] [Music]
[1:08:19] everybody okay
[1:08:21] is the bible complicated
[1:08:25] amen
[1:08:27] bear with me and she said the sixth
[1:08:29] measure of ballet gave him me innocently
[1:08:32] mama
[1:08:34] look this is what he gave me
[1:08:36] when naomi look
[1:08:38] let's see what naomi says about the
[1:08:40] sixth measure because they were a
[1:08:42] connection between them amen
[1:08:44] for he said unto me god not empty to
[1:08:47] your mother you know in other words this
[1:08:48] belongs to you
[1:08:50] then verse 18
[1:08:52] says she naomi
[1:08:54] do whatever
[1:08:57] when naomi look at the sixth measure
[1:09:01] now let me turn around
[1:09:03] you say daughter
[1:09:09] that's it
[1:09:11] sit still
[1:09:13] don't worry anymore
[1:09:19] everybody okay
[1:09:20] so the six
[1:09:24] seals
[1:09:25] the sixth
[1:09:27] measure of barley
[1:09:29] had a message
[1:09:31] of shalom
[1:09:37] amen peace
[1:09:39] sit still
[1:09:41] don't trouble yourself anymore
[1:09:45] i hope you're getting it
[1:09:48] sit still my daughter
[1:09:50] until you know how the mother will water
[1:09:54] for the man will not water
[1:10:00] who got the pressure now
[1:10:04] who got the pressure
[1:10:06] so in other words your pressure has been
[1:10:08] transferred
[1:10:10] [Music]
[1:10:12] towards somebody else
[1:10:14] anybody okay he will not rest until he
[1:10:18] has
[1:10:25] until he has done what
[1:10:27] finish water
[1:10:29] this water
[1:10:30] which thing
[1:10:33] not finish these things one thing
[1:10:37] because one thing
[1:10:39] take up everything in it
[1:10:42] everybody okay until he has finished
[1:10:45] this the thing this water in other words
[1:10:49] do not worry anymore
[1:10:53] the measure of barley that you receive
[1:10:56] have a message
[1:10:58] and that message is stand still
[1:11:02] anybody care don't worry anymore
[1:11:05] it is no more in your hand
[1:11:09] it is in the hand of boaz but for sure
[1:11:13] guarantee
[1:11:15] he will make sure
[1:11:18] he finish it
[1:11:20] did you get the message
[1:11:23] let's go to first samuel chapter 21
[1:11:27] hallelujah
[1:11:34] and you hear people the trumpet the
[1:11:35] trumpet the chop at the trumpet
[1:11:41] not complicated
[1:11:44] for the sake of time i'm going to skip
[1:11:46] some of them but you know the story
[1:11:49] david is running away
[1:11:52] david is running away
[1:11:56] he has been kicked out almost
[1:12:00] everybody okay
[1:12:02] amen let's go straight to verse uh
[1:12:06] three you know the uh background already
[1:12:09] now therefore
[1:12:11] what is under your hand david is asking
[1:12:13] the high priest
[1:12:15] give me if you want to know if it's a
[1:12:17] high priest there is a scripture for it
[1:12:19] and look you see me i'll give it to you
[1:12:22] now therefore what is under your hand
[1:12:24] give me what
[1:12:28] david asks for five loaves we know five
[1:12:31] is the number of water
[1:12:33] let's see if he's gonna get five
[1:12:37] you okay
[1:12:38] give me five loaves of bread in my hand
[1:12:41] and or what there is present
[1:12:44] in other words five
[1:12:46] grace or whatever is there
[1:12:50] everybody okay
[1:12:51] so there is a grace with something else
[1:12:53] it's hooked together everybody okay
[1:12:56] verse nine verse four and the priest
[1:12:58] answered david and say
[1:13:00] there is no common bread under my hand
[1:13:04] we don't have any bread that is mixed
[1:13:07] with leaven here
[1:13:10] because leaven top sin
[1:13:12] we don't have a gospel that is mixed
[1:13:15] with worldlyness
[1:13:19] we don't have it here
[1:13:21] everybody okay
[1:13:22] anybody okay but there is water
[1:13:25] hallow bread or the show bread
[1:13:28] if the young men have kept themselves at
[1:13:32] least from water
[1:13:33] you must stay away from other field you
[1:13:36] must stay away from denomination
[1:13:40] you must stay away from youtube
[1:13:42] listening to denominational
[1:13:44] [Music]
[1:13:46] to touch this bread
[1:13:47] you cannot eat this bread and then you
[1:13:49] going on youtube watching td jakes
[1:13:54] [Applause]
[1:13:58] everybody okay
[1:14:01] and david answered the priest and said
[1:14:03] to him of a truth women has been kept
[1:14:06] from us
[1:14:07] we are sanctified
[1:14:09] a bad is what
[1:14:12] three days
[1:14:13] since i came out and the vessels of the
[1:14:15] young men are holy
[1:14:17] and the bread is in a manner common yet
[1:14:21] though it was sanctified this day in the
[1:14:24] vessel we are pure if we eat we are pure
[1:14:27] just as the bread is pure amen
[1:14:30] so the gift so the priest verse six gave
[1:14:33] him hallow these are show bread
[1:14:36] hallow bread for there was no bread
[1:14:39] there but the water the show bread that
[1:14:43] was taken from before the lord
[1:14:48] so the bread that they gave david
[1:14:51] is a show bread how many show bread do
[1:14:55] we have in the tabernacle
[1:15:00] everybody okay
[1:15:01] we have 12 12 is the number of water
[1:15:08] david say grace or whatever
[1:15:12] the whatever turn up to b12
[1:15:18] are we okay so it's a grace
[1:15:21] that is bringing you to a worship
[1:15:25] i'm reading the scripture
[1:15:28] give me five grace
[1:15:30] or whatever the whatever turn up to be
[1:15:32] twelve
[1:15:34] so that grace
[1:15:35] open
[1:15:36] twelve
[1:15:40] are we okay
[1:15:42] why is grace opening 12.
[1:15:47] everybody okay
[1:15:49] and it happened that this was the day
[1:15:53] they were changing
[1:15:57] the showbread
[1:16:00] amen
[1:16:02] when do they change the showbread
[1:16:04] on monday on tuesday on wednesday
[1:16:11] are you okay now you remember the
[1:16:12] mystery of the show bread
[1:16:15] that's why i keep saying keep up with
[1:16:17] the sermon everybody okay so far
[1:16:21] that was taken from before the lord to
[1:16:24] put hot in other words fresh bread in
[1:16:26] the day when he was taken away everybody
[1:16:28] okay
[1:16:29] when this giving of bread
[1:16:32] from grace unto worship is happening
[1:16:35] at the same place
[1:16:38] i want you to keep your spiritual jacket
[1:16:40] verse seven
[1:16:42] now a certain man
[1:16:44] of the servant of who

[1:16:55] before who
[1:16:57] there was something with that man
[1:17:00] that the man was not able to leave the
[1:17:03] tabernacle
[1:17:05] the lord blocked the man
[1:17:08] anybody okay
[1:17:10] so that man have to be released the same
[1:17:14] time david is getting his bread
[1:17:19] let me read it
[1:17:20] and his name was doeeg
[1:17:23] a water

[1:17:37] in the tabernacle how did esau get in
[1:17:40] the temple

[1:18:16] spear or sword
[1:18:18] for i have neither brought my sword

[1:18:25] business require haste
[1:18:27] what happened to the old soul of david
[1:18:30] that he was working for saul
[1:18:33] why did he leave and forgot that sword
[1:18:37] anybody okay

[1:19:01] taken away and kept
[1:19:03] and never used again
[1:19:06] until this time that david is expelled
[1:19:12] going into the tabernacle and david now

[1:27:45] to priest and king
[1:27:47] which is nothing but the lineage of
[1:27:50] melchizedek
[1:27:53] because mechizzadek was prison king

[1:27:58] you to reign on earth
[1:28:00] but that raining is how long
[1:28:04] a thousand mere means water

[1:28:22] grace for your love for your mercy and
[1:28:25] for everything you have been doing for

[1:28:27] father we have done what any man that
[1:28:29] you give an ability to do can do on the
[1:28:32] face of the earth but when it comes to
[1:28:35] opening your word and bringing the
[1:28:37] scripture a life to your children you
[1:28:39] only take the supernatural action of the
[1:28:42] holy spirit father may you move me
[1:28:44] completely out of the way lord may you
[1:28:46] come and speak to your children may you
[1:28:48] remove every demonic pressure
[1:28:51] demon of pressure
[1:28:54] may you remove every demon unique spirit
[1:28:57] here that is making the people to sleep
[1:29:00] father we rebuke every demonic spirit
[1:29:03] that is contrary to your word may you

[1:29:08] reign in this building and may you visit
[1:29:11] and speak to us this morning in the name
[1:29:13] of jesus christ
[1:29:15] amen amen god richly bless you
[1:29:19] in revelation 8 the bible says that when
[1:29:22] he opened the seventh seal remember last
[1:29:25] sunday there was a silence
[1:29:28] in heaven
[1:29:29] of about a space of half an hour we
[1:29:32] already know what the half an hour was
[1:29:34] but the key here is when the seventh
[1:29:37] seal was opened it was completely mute
[1:29:41] it was silenced
[1:29:43] we don't know what's going on
[1:29:46] my subject this morning
[1:29:49] is the four phases of roof
[1:29:52] god's
[1:29:54] rest
[1:29:56] the rest of god
[1:29:59] the rest of our father
[1:30:01] the rest of god
[1:30:03] last sunday it was the sabbath today
[1:30:07] it's the rest of god so put your
[1:30:09] seatbelt as we begin to go this is part
[1:30:12] 22.
[1:30:13] when we started with the tabernacle
[1:30:17] we took roof and roof enter into the
[1:30:20] gate
[1:30:21] roof have to go through many steps for
[1:30:24] the plan of redemption she went to the
[1:30:26] brazen altar she had to repent of her
[1:30:29] sin then from there she get to be
[1:30:31] baptized then from there she go into the
[1:30:34] holy place roof serving now we are in
[1:30:37] the fourth stage where roof now is
[1:30:41] resting where naomi open up the subject
[1:30:44] about the rest of the roof
[1:30:47] everybody cleared so far
[1:30:49] this is a big picture a macroscopic view
[1:30:54] of the plan of redemption when we went
[1:30:56] through ezekiel ezekiel entered into
[1:31:00] some more detail
[1:31:01] in a microscopic view where we found out
[1:31:04] that when we enter into the tabernacle
[1:31:07] whether you're born in a message or not
[1:31:09] you must find or meet the present altar
[1:31:12] to make a decision which we talked
[1:31:14] yesterday because decisions are very
[1:31:16] important because that's represent the
[1:31:20] the cross for us
[1:31:22] why the cross brother branham say that
[1:31:25] this whole bible to my opinion
[1:31:28] the whole setup is a dramatic story
[1:31:32] it's a big drama
[1:31:34] just starting out of eden when man was
[1:31:37] kicked out
[1:31:38] coming out through the gate
[1:31:40] on out
[1:31:42] and the way of the cross leading right
[1:31:45] back again
[1:31:46] so in eden we left the garden
[1:31:49] we left the blessing of god we miss the
[1:31:52] tree of life but through the cross we
[1:31:55] are not going away from the tree of life
[1:31:58] now we are going back again
[1:32:01] into the tree of life
[1:32:03] over there the kerry beam kick us out
[1:32:06] but over here the caribbeans are there
[1:32:08] to welcome you and me back again in the
[1:32:11] presence of god because the lamb gave
[1:32:14] his own blood and when he gave his own
[1:32:17] blood on cavalry the veil of the temple
[1:32:20] rented into and the way it was open
[1:32:23] telling the believer that now we can go
[1:32:26] back again into the presence of god
[1:32:28] brother branham said the way of the
[1:32:30] cross is leading right back again just
[1:32:33] all one big god picture god has placed
[1:32:37] out of his mind everybody cleared so far
[1:32:40] so when you finish there at the cross
[1:32:43] you make a decision that decision of
[1:32:45] giving your life to jesus christ will
[1:32:48] change your heart
[1:32:49] into a dark heart into a white one which
[1:32:52] ezekiel explained to us that he was a
[1:32:55] new heart then you go through the water
[1:32:57] baptism and you get baptized and when
[1:33:00] you get baptized then he sends you
[1:33:02] completely into the candlestick
[1:33:06] i'm going to emphasize
[1:33:08] that the candlestick will direct you to
[1:33:11] the table of the showbread
[1:33:14] now there is no difference
[1:33:17] between the table of the showbread and
[1:33:20] the candlestick
[1:33:24] the candlesticks are always connected to
[1:33:28] the table of the showbread
[1:33:31] amen everybody
[1:33:32] you cannot have a field without the
[1:33:35] reapers
[1:33:37] [Music]
[1:33:39] you cannot deal with the seed without
[1:33:41] the reapers
[1:33:44] everybody okay so far because if you
[1:33:47] enter into the tabernacle when you pass
[1:33:50] the other coat and when you enter into
[1:33:53] the holy place if the candlestick are
[1:33:56] not there this place is dark
[1:34:01] everybody okay so far if you enter into
[1:34:04] the candlestick the table of the
[1:34:07] showbread will be dark
[1:34:10] and the bread that is on the table of
[1:34:13] the showbread will not be visible to you
[1:34:20] everybody okay so far it takes the light
[1:34:23] of the candlestick
[1:34:26] ever here the candlestick will project
[1:34:29] its right
[1:34:32] and when the light of the candlestick
[1:34:35] struck the bread
[1:34:36] the bread that was dark become
[1:34:39] illuminated
[1:34:42] [Music]
[1:34:43] let's go to ephesian four
[1:34:47] i'm just climbing
[1:34:50] let's go to ephesians four
[1:34:52] hallelujah
[1:34:54] if you dare you can say amen
[1:34:57] go to ephesians 4
[1:34:59] verse 13
[1:35:02] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:35:05] you there
[1:35:06] few people amen
[1:35:08] you there
[1:35:10] but all things
[1:35:14] dada reproof
[1:35:17] ephesians 5 verse 13
[1:35:21] ephesians 5 verse 13.
[1:35:24] if you dare you can say amen
[1:35:28] all things that are reproved
[1:35:31] or exposed
[1:35:33] are made manifest by what
[1:35:40] everybody okay
[1:35:41] for whatsoever does make manifest is
[1:35:44] what
[1:35:45] so the light is what will make this
[1:35:48] bread
[1:35:49] to become visible unto you
[1:35:54] everybody care because the bread
[1:35:57] represented the word of god
[1:36:00] but no matter how much you have the word
[1:36:02] of god
[1:36:04] if there is no light
[1:36:06] that struck the word of god this word
[1:36:09] will be dead to you
[1:36:12] because paul said that the scripture the
[1:36:14] letter killeth
[1:36:16] it is the spirit that giveth life
[1:36:19] so you must have a light that will shine
[1:36:22] on the
[1:36:23] and when the lights shine on the
[1:36:25] scripture then the scripture become
[1:36:28] illuminated
[1:36:30] and the scripture becomes the light of
[1:36:33] the hour
[1:36:34] [Music]
[1:36:36] everybody
[1:36:38] in other words you cannot separate the
[1:36:41] illuminated scripture with the light
[1:36:44] that have shined upon the scripture
[1:36:46] that's why brother branham said the
[1:36:48] messenger and his message are one and
[1:36:52] the same
[1:36:55] amount
[1:36:58] in the book of acts chapter 13
[1:37:01] verse 27
[1:37:03] the bible said that
[1:37:05] for they that dwell at jerusalem
[1:37:09] and their rulers
[1:37:11] because they knew
[1:37:12] because they knew him not
[1:37:14] [Music]
[1:37:15] that he was jesus christ
[1:37:18] no
[1:37:18] yet the voices of the water
[1:37:26] so to know god
[1:37:28] you must know the voice of the prophet
[1:37:32] [Music]
[1:37:36] everybody okay
[1:37:37] know the voices of the prophet which are
[1:37:41] what
[1:37:42] so those voices were read in other words
[1:37:45] what the prophet spoke turn into a
[1:37:49] scripture
[1:37:51] and that scripture must be read every
[1:37:55] sabbath
[1:37:57] [Music]
[1:37:58] that's why we must read the message of
[1:38:01] the hour every day that we preach here
[1:38:05] [Applause]
[1:38:06] because you must know the voice of the
[1:38:08] prophet
[1:38:10] in order to know jesus christ
[1:38:18] in our act chapter 15
[1:38:20] the bible says this verse 21 from moses
[1:38:24] of the old time has in every city damn
[1:38:28] that the water
[1:38:32] let me read it again
[1:38:34] moses of the old time head in every city
[1:38:38] does that preach jesus
[1:38:41] [Music]
[1:38:46] they were preaching moses
[1:38:48] they were not preaching moses the man
[1:38:52] but they were preaching the law of moses
[1:38:55] they were preaching the message of moses
[1:38:59] and the message of moses was not moses
[1:39:03] the message of moses was christ
[1:39:12] brother branham say brother branham say
[1:39:14] we're not preaching the men brother
[1:39:16] branham
[1:39:17] we're preaching the message of brother
[1:39:19] branham
[1:39:20] [Applause]
[1:39:20] [Music]
[1:39:25] everybody here
[1:39:27] second peter say for the prophecy
[1:39:30] came not in the old time by the wheel of
[1:39:33] water
[1:39:34] but holy men of god spake as they were
[1:39:38] moved by water so he was not the prophet
[1:39:43] when they were reading the voice of the
[1:39:45] prophet they were not reading the man
[1:39:47] prophet they were reading the word of
[1:39:50] god that's the holy spirit spoke through
[1:39:54] the prophet
[1:39:56] everybody okay
[1:39:58] jesus said forever
[1:40:03] why didn't he say have ye believed
[1:40:05] jehovah
[1:40:06] [Music]
[1:40:09] because on the old testament his name
[1:40:11] was jehovah he didn't say have you
[1:40:14] believed jehovah he said have ye
[1:40:16] believed moses
[1:40:18] not moses the man moses as a messenger
[1:40:22] of god if you have believed moses you
[1:40:25] would have believed what
[1:40:27] for moses did what
[1:40:30] so there is no way you can receive
[1:40:32] christ
[1:40:34] [Music]
[1:40:38] without a prophet
[1:40:41] [Applause]
[1:40:43] but if he believes not his writing i
[1:40:46] shall he believe my water how are you
[1:40:49] going to believe jesus christ
[1:40:51] if nobody preach him to you

[1:45:32] of himself
[1:45:34] or of some other water
[1:45:36] when you are reading the message without
[1:45:39] the holy ghost
[1:45:40] this is where you get confusion whether
[1:45:44] brother branham is talking about himself
[1:45:47] our brother branham is talking about
[1:45:49] christ
[1:45:50] [Music]
[1:45:55] everybody here he took another
[1:45:58] reaper
[1:45:59] to be there and to take the prophet and
[1:46:03] to break it down until the eunuch
[1:46:06] realized that isaiah was not talking
[1:46:09] about himself
[1:46:10] but he was jesus christ in isaiah
[1:46:14] so when we are preaching isaiah we're
[1:46:17] now preaching isaiah we preaching jesus
[1:46:20] christ in the life of isaiah and let me
[1:46:24] put it wrong when we preach brother
[1:46:26] branham
[1:46:27] we're now preaching brother branham
[1:46:29] we're preaching jesus christ in the life
[1:46:32] of brother branham
[1:46:36] you want to call me branamat go ahead
[1:46:38] and call me
[1:46:39] you just don't understand what it is the
[1:46:42] messenger in his message i won
[1:46:46] [Applause]
[1:46:48] that's why brother branham said you are
[1:46:50] not feeding upon the word of men but you
[1:46:53] are feeding upon the unfailing body word
[1:46:57] of the son of man that's why the message
[1:47:00] is christ
[1:47:03] this message is jesus christ
[1:47:08] [Applause]
[1:47:11] don't worry buddy you will do you good
[1:47:14] everybody okay so far
[1:47:16] so you need to go through that
[1:47:18] and it's gonna lead you to the uh after
[1:47:21] offences from there then you got a new
[1:47:23] spirit
[1:47:25] everybody okay
[1:47:27] now from the new spirit we need to go
[1:47:28] into the inside where we get his spirit
[1:47:33] but we found out that the key to go on
[1:47:36] the inside was water
[1:47:38] obedience but here that's why roof have
[1:47:41] to stay on the field
[1:47:44] don't listen to any other field
[1:47:46] and she have to keep fast with the
[1:47:48] maiden and finish the entire harvest
[1:47:52] and when she did that naomi said now are
[1:47:55] you worthy
[1:47:57] to go into the holiest
[1:47:59] let me now open up the subject about the
[1:48:02] rest
[1:48:03] we found out that this place is very
[1:48:06] important because we talked about the
[1:48:08] road of aaron
[1:48:10] it was dead
[1:48:11] it could turn into a stake
[1:48:14] until they put that road into a holiest
[1:48:17] when they put it there they hold
[1:48:19] battered he blossomed and he brought
[1:48:22] fruit
[1:48:28] this fruit
[1:48:30] never came
[1:48:32] with the connection of the road to the
[1:48:36] ground
[1:48:41] did you hear me
[1:48:42] they never took that road and planted
[1:48:46] it is not a worldly fruit
[1:48:50] you don't need worldly root
[1:48:53] all you need
[1:48:54] is detect the road and just leave it
[1:48:57] there
[1:48:58] the longer it stays
[1:49:01] in the presence of the sun
[1:49:05] ever here without any root
[1:49:08] without any work
[1:49:11] just sitting and resting
[1:49:13] under the presence of the chicana
[1:49:17] little by little you want to find
[1:49:19] yourself batting
[1:49:22] and after a while you blossom and before
[1:49:24] you know it you begin to begin to
[1:49:27] produce fruit
[1:49:28] and those fruit will tell exactly who
[1:49:31] you are
[1:49:32] because nobody knew this was an almond
[1:49:35] tree
[1:49:36] the identity was lost
[1:49:39] but here until it went into the only of
[1:49:42] all yes then your true identity will
[1:49:46] come out what you really are so we came
[1:49:49] in this world we were lost in sin we
[1:49:52] were lost in our families we thought we
[1:49:55] belonged to our family but we found out

[1:50:02] not the child of mr branham i have
[1:50:05] another father a father that came from
[1:50:08] heaven his name is jesus christ
[1:50:11] and you want to produce fruit that are
[1:50:14] reflecting jesus christ

[1:53:07] [Music]
[1:53:10] everybody okay so far so my daughter i
[1:53:13] need to find you rest
[1:53:16] and we found out that what is rest rest
[1:53:19] was the sabbath
[1:53:21] ever here and last sunday we found out
[1:53:23] that there is three sabbaths in the
[1:53:26] scripture
[1:53:27] the first sabbath was the sabbath of the
[1:53:31] rest of god
[1:53:33] the second one was the rest of israel
[1:53:37] and the third one was the rest of the
[1:53:40] church
[1:53:41] and we started with the rest of god and
[1:53:44] we stopped somewhere that's why we are
[1:53:47] picking up god's rest
[1:53:50] what is god rest
[1:53:54] everybody okay so far
[1:53:56] we found out that according to the
[1:53:58] scripture
[1:54:00] you can take your seatbelt off
[1:54:02] according to the scripture in genesis 2
[1:54:05] verse 2 the bible says on the seventh
[1:54:09] day
[1:54:12] the sabbath which is the rest
[1:54:16] happened on the seventh day
[1:54:20] anybody okay on the seventh day
[1:54:24] god ended his work
[1:54:26] which he had made
[1:54:30] amen how can you end the work in a day
[1:54:35] yesterday we were working
[1:54:37] we pull up the tent
[1:54:39] right
[1:54:41] after we pull up the tent did we have
[1:54:42] any more work to do
[1:54:44] so normally the work ended on yesterday
[1:54:47] so how can you come today and you say
[1:54:50] that i am ending the work yesterday did
[1:54:53] you do any work today
[1:54:55] so why are you ending at work in the day
[1:54:57] that you didn't do work
[1:55:02] hallelujah so god ended his work
[1:55:07] which he had made
[1:55:08] so this ending
[1:55:10] means that there is something
[1:55:14] that happened
[1:55:15] on the seventh day that we don't know
[1:55:19] and whatever happened in the seventh day
[1:55:23] finish
[1:55:25] seal
[1:55:27] stop
[1:55:28] ended
[1:55:29] the entire work of god what happened in
[1:55:32] that day
[1:55:34] we don't know
[1:55:36] that day
[1:55:37] is just telling us that god ended
[1:55:40] it's a silence day
[1:55:44] it's a mute day
[1:55:47] it's a day that doesn't give much
[1:55:49] information
[1:55:51] it doesn't give us no detail
[1:55:56] how what happened
[1:55:58] okay now when when we say god ended what
[1:56:01] does he mean does it mean that god went
[1:56:04] and sat down does he mean that god went
[1:56:06] to sleep does it mean that god went
[1:56:09] fishing what does he mean ending
[1:56:15] hallelujah god ended his work which he
[1:56:19] made
[1:56:20] and he rested on the seventh day from
[1:56:23] all his work which he made brother
[1:56:26] branham said this rest was a physical
[1:56:29] waste
[1:56:30] but god was not human yet
[1:56:32] god became human in jesus christ
[1:56:38] how can a spirit rest physically
[1:56:43] everybody okay so far
[1:56:45] hallelujah he said god blessed the
[1:56:48] seventh day
[1:56:50] so it's a blessed day
[1:56:52] [Music]
[1:56:54] hallelujah and god sanctify it
[1:56:59] you remember that sunday
[1:57:01] because that emit
[1:57:04] in that day
[1:57:05] god had rested from all his work which
[1:57:09] god created and made
[1:57:12] what caused god to rest
[1:57:17] if you have a task to do
[1:57:20] anybody care
[1:57:21] in order to rest you must complete
[1:57:24] your task
[1:57:26] then you will be able to go to rest
[1:57:29] so that is telling us that on the
[1:57:32] seventh day
[1:57:33] god already completed his work
[1:57:40] now
[1:57:41] god
[1:57:43] never rested after the first day
[1:57:48] everybody okay
[1:57:50] god never rested after the second day
[1:57:54] god never rested after the third day
[1:57:58] never rested after the fourth day
[1:58:01] but god rested after the sixth day
[1:58:06] so the sixth day
[1:58:09] has something in me
[1:58:12] everybody okay
[1:58:13] that triggered god
[1:58:16] to god to rest
[1:58:18] [Music]

[2:01:09] the first
[2:01:10] uh the last verse of the first chapter
[2:01:13] before god rested and god saw
[2:01:16] everything that he has made
[2:01:19] and behold he was
[2:01:23] not just good
[2:01:26] everybody okay
[2:01:27] he was very good

[2:02:28] before god got to this point
[2:02:31] let me go
[2:02:32] let us make man in our own water
[2:02:36] before you move forward you need to know
[2:02:39] what is the image of that god
[2:02:42] [Music]
[2:02:42] [Applause]
[2:02:46] in other words the man that was created
[2:02:48] was created in the image of god
[2:02:52] in other words the men look like god
[2:02:56] [Music]
[2:02:57] [Applause]
[2:02:58] [Music]
[2:02:59] [Applause]
[2:03:00] anybody here but we know according to
[2:03:03] john 4
[2:03:04] chapter 21 verse 21 the bible said god
[2:03:08] is earth
[2:03:09] [Applause]
[2:03:12] god was a spirit
[2:03:16] we already went through this i'm
[2:03:17] touching up quickly anybody okay
[2:03:21] this spirit
[2:03:23] in himself
[2:03:24] he has a bosom you remember and in the
[2:03:29] bosom there was a son
[2:03:33] anybody here
[2:03:34] he was called the logos
[2:03:36] because the bible said the only begotten
[2:03:39] of the father who was in the
[2:03:42] everybody okay anybody okay
[2:03:45] so god the spirit
[2:03:48] moved somebody out
[2:03:52] and the one who came out you already
[2:03:55] know this
[2:03:56] came as a pillar of fire
[2:04:00] as a light
[2:04:02] everybody care
[2:04:04] and this process here we know it's
[2:04:07] called god being immorphy
[2:04:12] anybody okay
[2:04:13] but this one
[2:04:15] when the sun came
[2:04:18] this because he gave birth
[2:04:21] to something
[2:04:22] he took the name of the father
[2:04:28] everybody okay
[2:04:30] then the one who he was giving birth
[2:04:33] became the son
[2:04:38] everybody okay
[2:04:39] and this spirit
[2:04:41] could not remain spirit
[2:04:43] because there is a process called
[2:04:45] keonosis you already know this
[2:04:48] where the spirit itself
[2:04:50] enter inside the sauna
[2:04:54] ever here
[2:04:56] and they too become one
[2:05:02] this is why when philip said show us the
[2:05:05] father
[2:05:06] and that will finish the problem and
[2:05:09] jesus said philip still now you don't
[2:05:11] understand when you see me
[2:05:14] you see the father because me and my
[2:05:17] father we are
[2:05:21] [Applause]
[2:05:22] everybody okay so far
[2:05:24] so this one that came out
[2:05:27] the theologian call him the theophany
[2:05:32] which is the logos
[2:05:35] which is the word body
[2:05:38] ever care
[2:05:39] about so far
[2:05:41] then this theophany was made flesh
[2:05:46] in demand called water
[2:05:49] so you have three components here
[2:05:52] number one you got a spirit
[2:05:55] number two you got a theophany
[2:05:58] and number three you got a human body
[2:06:05] everybody care
[2:06:06] but in the beginning the man jesus was
[2:06:10] not there
[2:06:13] because jesus was not born yet
[2:06:16] ever here
[2:06:18] because john said in the beginning was
[2:06:21] there
[2:06:23] everybody care and the word was with
[2:06:27] and the word was
[2:06:33] any question
[2:06:34] in the beginning was there
[2:06:37] and this word was with
[2:06:39] as an attribute and this word was
[2:06:43] because god dwelleth in the world
[2:06:49] everybody here so this part right here
[2:06:53] is eternity
[2:06:56] everybody here and this part here is the
[2:06:59] beginning
[2:07:04] everybody here so when god became the
[2:07:07] pillar of fire
[2:07:09] this is where god begin to create stuff
[2:07:13] [Music]
[2:07:15] but here that's why hebrews say nothing
[2:07:18] was created without him
[2:07:20] without the word it was the word that
[2:07:23] was created everything so the word
[2:07:26] created on the first day
[2:07:29] everybody okay
[2:07:30] the word created on the second day
[2:07:33] the word created on the third day
[2:07:36] the word created on the fourth day the
[2:07:39] word created on the fifth day but on the
[2:07:42] sixth day
[2:07:44] everybody okay so far
[2:07:46] the word
[2:07:48] the theophany
[2:07:50] the logos
[2:07:52] begin to create
[2:07:54] something that look like him
[2:07:59] [Music]
[2:08:04] everybody okay so far
[2:08:05] everybody okay so far let's go back now
[2:08:08] to genesis 20 126.
[2:08:12] that's why he says

[2:10:43] man singular
[2:10:45] have what
[2:10:47] stop
[2:10:49] when god created the star did he give
[2:10:52] the star dominion
[2:10:54] when god created the moon did they give
[2:10:57] the moon dominion when he created the
[2:11:00] animal did they have dominion when he
[2:11:02] created the fishes and the fowl did they
[2:11:04] have dominion

[2:11:17] in other words i am giving him authority
[2:11:23] [Music]
[2:11:24] everybody okay so far
[2:11:26] if god is a theophany
[2:11:30] he's a word
[2:11:31] he's a logos and he's created man
[2:11:35] like him
[2:11:38] anybody care
[2:11:39] this man is also what
[2:11:45] are we okay did i lose somebody
[2:11:48] this man is also here to

[2:12:41] of everything
[2:12:44] men control
[2:12:46] everything
[2:12:48] everybody here
[2:12:50] because the roman centurion
[2:12:53] told jesus christ
[2:12:55] that i am a man
[2:13:02] in other words i have a head
[2:13:05] okay
[2:13:06] because i have a head
[2:13:08] i also have authority
[2:13:12] and my authority lays with my word
[2:13:17] when i tell my servant go
[2:13:20] you go come back here you come back here
[2:13:23] jesus look
[2:13:26] he said disunderstanding
[2:13:30] the jews don't know this
[2:13:34] this understanding of authority by the
[2:13:38] spoken word
[2:13:40] the jews don't know this
[2:13:41] this man is automatically breaking into
[2:13:45] the material of god
[2:13:48] here
[2:13:49] because he was a man under authority
[2:13:53] with authority
[2:13:59] let me help you up again
[2:14:01] a police officer
[2:14:04] have power
[2:14:06] when he is under power
[2:14:12] everybody okay
[2:14:13] when he work with the state
[2:14:16] he has power to arrest you
[2:14:20] everybody okay
[2:14:21] as long as his connection
[2:14:25] with the state remain correct
[2:14:28] his power is still valid
[2:14:34] everybody okay
[2:14:36] he loses power
[2:14:38] when he is disconnected
[2:14:40] from the state
[2:14:41] when they fire him
[2:14:44] you can do to the police officer
[2:14:46] whatever you want to do with him
[2:14:49] everybody here but if he is under
[2:14:53] if adam is still in connection with god
[2:14:57] [Applause]
[2:14:59] then his authority is still valid
[2:15:03] adam will lose authority when he kind
[2:15:06] off connection with god
[2:15:11] did i lose somebody
[2:15:13] so the authority
[2:15:15] is connected to connection
[2:15:22] did i lose somebody
[2:15:24] so authority
[2:15:26] is connected to connection to a higher
[2:15:30] power
[2:15:32] ever here
[2:15:34] this authority
[2:15:39] [Music]
[2:15:41] this dominion
[2:15:43] [Music]
[2:15:45] is a hidden language
[2:15:53] [Music]
[2:15:54] [Applause]
[2:15:56] [Music]
[2:16:00] the police officer
[2:16:03] he have to work with his contract
[2:16:06] to show you his contract
[2:16:08] before he arrests you
[2:16:15] everybody
[2:16:16] the contract is the tattered d
[2:16:21] and that tattoo
[2:16:22] gives him authority
[2:16:25] and the day he's gonna mess up with the
[2:16:27] state he loses his tattoo
[2:16:31] and the state recuperate their authority
[2:16:34] back
[2:16:40] that's why brother branham said adam had
[2:16:44] the tattoo
[2:16:48] because the totally gives you authority
[2:16:52] and dominion
[2:16:54] as long as you say connected with your
[2:16:57] maker
[2:17:01] did i lose somebody

[2:34:42] 11. and i behead another one
[2:34:47] coming out of the water
[2:34:49] so the earth also produces a beast
[2:34:52] [Music]
[2:34:53] everybody okay
[2:34:54] and the beast
[2:34:56] he had how many horns
[2:34:59] like a water and he spoke as a water
[2:35:02] and brother branham said that two horn
[2:35:04] was civil
[2:35:07] seavilles mean politics
[2:35:10] and a water
[2:35:14] hey mark here so the sea
[2:35:18] and the earth produce three power
[2:35:21] yes my brother
[2:35:24] i hope you are with me the sea produce
[2:35:28] demonic power
[2:35:29] the earth produces
[2:35:32] political
[2:35:33] and ecclesiastical
[2:35:35] those three powers
[2:35:38] are the pearl horse
[2:35:42] [Music]
[2:35:46] because brother branham said the
[2:35:48] pelhouse have three colors
[2:35:51] that are mixed together and those colors
[2:35:54] are political
[2:35:56] ecclesiastical and demonic power
[2:35:59] and the name of the pearls was water
[2:36:03] so when the mighty angel is coming down
[2:36:07] he's stepping on death
[2:36:09] in all his aspects
[2:36:11] [Applause]
[2:36:17] everybody here they were the pearl horse
[2:36:21] that is riding on laodicea
[2:36:23] there is a mighty angel that is coming
[2:36:26] down
[2:36:27] and he is the answer
[2:36:30] to that horse
[2:36:31] [Music]
[2:36:34] because because
[2:36:37] man
[2:36:38] in the theophany with the book have
[2:36:41] dominion
[2:36:43] so the angel in theophany with the book
[2:36:47] must have
[2:36:51] [Music]
[2:36:54] [Applause]
[2:36:57] everybody okay
[2:36:59] everybody okay
[2:37:00] lord have mercy
[2:37:02] what are you saying
[2:37:04] brother branham say the f chapter
[2:37:07] of revelation only revealed the scene of
[2:37:11] the water
[2:37:14] where
[2:37:18] nothing
[2:37:19] the seventh day
[2:37:21] nothing
[2:37:22] silence
[2:37:23] anybody okay
[2:37:25] is not revealing the seventh seal
[2:37:29] it's revealing of the seven seals is
[2:37:32] perfectly what
[2:37:33] so when you answer when they open the
[2:37:35] seventh seal quiet
[2:37:37] when god rested
[2:37:39] quiet
[2:37:40] but we found
[2:37:42] the answer to the quietness of god
[2:37:45] is man was created with a logos with a
[2:37:49] teopany and we found in revelation 10
[2:37:53] another man another crust with theophany
[2:37:57] and with water
[2:38:01] the rest of god
[2:38:04] all the way back from what
[2:38:07] [Music]
[2:38:08] this what
[2:38:12] brother branham said
[2:38:14] all the way back in genesis
[2:38:17] the seventh seal he spoke of
[2:38:22] [Music]
[2:38:25] so we need to go back in genesis
[2:38:28] at the beginning of genesis you're gonna
[2:38:32] find the seventh seal there
[2:38:35] so the rest of god on the seventh day
[2:38:39] was actually the seventh here
[2:38:47] he said all the way from genesis the
[2:38:51] seventh here is spoken from the word
[2:38:55] so you must go at the very beginning of
[2:38:58] the book of genesis you will see the
[2:39:00] seventh seal there and brother branham
[2:39:02] left it quiet
[2:39:04] it is now up to the holy spirit
[2:39:07] to take us on genesis and we found out
[2:39:11] that on genesis there is a specific day
[2:39:14] that is quiet and it's the seventh day
[2:39:17] and god doesn't say anything about that
[2:39:20] day but the answer to that day is on the
[2:39:23] sixth day which is man with a book and
[2:39:26] the theophany and we go back in
[2:39:29] revelation 10 after the opening of the
[2:39:32] seventh seal we see now with maddie
[2:39:34] andrew coming down with a tiophony and
[2:39:37] with the book so the rest of god is the
[2:39:41] seventh seal open

[2:46:22] he unfolded the sixth year on the
[2:46:24] seventh he rested boaz opened the sixth
[2:46:28] measure of bali at the seven boaz didn't
[2:46:31] say anything he said go with the six
[2:46:33] when naomi saw the six say that say
[2:46:37] stop worrying
[2:46:39] stop struggling
[2:46:40] stop kicking up again
[2:46:42] now it's time for you to go to sleep
[2:46:46] amen rest a little brad for all these
[2:46:50] don't worry anymore it is not your
[2:46:53] problem it is his responsibility
[2:46:56] to put his foot on the sea to put his
[2:46:59] foot on the land to take care of your
[2:47:02] problem
[2:47:03] you rest
[2:47:05] because god took your place
[2:47:08] god's rest
[2:47:10] is the seventh hill
[2:47:12] that same rest
[2:47:13] ushering into the millennium but we
[2:47:16] gotta stop here because i cannot touch
[2:47:18] the millennium amen
[2:47:21] amen
[2:47:22] god's rest was hidden in the garden of
[2:47:25] eden the rest was the seventh year it
[2:47:28] was perfectly close
[2:47:30] but it means that men
[2:47:33] have the turtle did that you lost that
[2:47:36] adam lost
[2:47:37] the dominion that you lost i am bringing
[2:47:41] that down
[2:47:42] i am now
[2:47:44] i am controlling the two beasts but i'm
[2:47:48] not only controlling the two beasts i
[2:47:51] have a book
[2:47:52] that book is open
[2:47:55] now john
[2:47:57] go to the angel
[2:48:03] go get the book because when you get the
[2:48:06] book you get the tatter d you get the
[2:48:09] contract back the police department hire
[2:48:13] you back
[2:48:14] you have power back
[2:48:17] now it's time to exercise your authority
[2:48:21] because the contract is back the title d
[2:48:24] came back
[2:48:25] now you need to speak because you are no
[2:48:29] longer any man
[2:48:30] but you become a man and a woman i'm the
[2:48:33] authority so what you speak must happen
[2:48:37] if i say go here it must go if i say
[2:48:40] come here it must come because god
[2:48:44] rested on the seventh day in the seven
[2:48:47] church ages under the seventh messenger
[2:48:50] of the seventh seal that is your rest
[2:48:52] let's stand
[2:48:58] [Applause]
[2:49:04] [Music]
[2:49:09] this is just a portion of this rest
[2:49:14] now when we say the turtle d
[2:49:16] have came back
[2:49:17] you begin to understand what we are
[2:49:19] telling you
[2:49:21] why because our connection now with the
[2:49:23] father is wire back and because you made
[2:49:27] peace with god
[2:49:28] you are brought back again to what adam
[2:49:31] and eve were
[2:49:32] before the fall
[2:49:34] that's why god is bringing the book of
[2:49:36] redemption
[2:49:38] ever here because when adam lost that
[2:49:40] book he took the book back from adam and
[2:49:44] he sealed it with six with sevenself
[2:49:47] and he closed the book
[2:49:49] amen but in sunset mountain he's telling
[2:49:52] you the penalty of what adam did it's
[2:49:56] already been paid
[2:49:58] now i'm restoring the book not as a
[2:50:01] close book
[2:50:02] because when i took it it was open
[2:50:04] men could do anything let me break the
[2:50:07] seals again
[2:50:08] and let me give it to you now you have
[2:50:10] the contract
[2:50:12] no matter who you are how little you are
[2:50:14] where you are remember you got a
[2:50:17] contract you are under authority and
[2:50:20] when you are under authority you have
[2:50:23] power to exercise dominion
[2:50:26] sin can no longer rule in your life
[2:50:29] [Music]
[2:50:31] amen
[2:50:32] amen
[2:50:33] no matter what they say in politics
[2:50:35] don't worry about it because there is
[2:50:38] one foot of the angel that is blocking
[2:50:40] politics
[2:50:41] politics will do nothing to the bride
[2:50:44] even the squeeze matter of fact the
[2:50:46] squeeze will release the third pool
[2:50:51] [Music]
[2:50:53] brother bonham said when you see the
[2:50:54] squeeze he said watch the third pull
[2:50:56] then why because the part the third
[2:50:59] pulled the power of the spoken word why
[2:51:01] because the title d is back
[2:51:04] when the devil thinks he's gonna corner
[2:51:06] you
[2:51:07] that's what pushes you to speak
[2:51:10] and when you speak it's not really you
[2:51:12] speaking
[2:51:13] it is the true you
[2:51:15] that is inside of you that you speak
[2:51:18] sometimes you go to trial through many
[2:51:20] problems and you are cornered you say
[2:51:23] god knows everything and that same god
[2:51:26] knows everything tomorrow you see things
[2:51:28] begin to change you didn't pray but that
[2:51:31] word that came out god knows everything
[2:51:34] that word will chase your enemy
[2:51:37] that word will whip people and bring the
[2:51:40] people back to you to apologize to you
[2:51:42] of what they did because you just
[2:51:45] express something
[2:51:47] and what you express
[2:51:49] god picks it up
[2:51:50] and say if it's my child word it is as
[2:51:53] soon as sure as my word that's why they
[2:51:56] put brother branham in tests they put
[2:51:58] people doing wrong things they say say
[2:52:00] something
[2:52:01] they knew brother branham could struck
[2:52:03] dead and by the random say i forgive
[2:52:05] them he said that's exactly what i would
[2:52:07] do
[2:52:08] because if it was me i would forgive it
[2:52:10] that's my sound in my image
[2:52:12] he can exercise authority
[2:52:15] the correct way amen
[2:52:19] anybody here
[2:52:20] because it's the rest of god
[2:52:22] and you are god
[2:52:24] if your father rested that means to you
[2:52:27] also
[2:52:31] and when you rest your responsibility
[2:52:33] goes back to
[2:52:35] boaz it is not you to take care of your
[2:52:37] life anymore put your car in
[2:52:41] go to sleep a little brad let boaz take
[2:52:44] over heavenly father
[2:52:47] lord we are approaching you again humbly
[2:52:49] father thanking you for your grace
[2:52:53] thanking you for your love
[2:52:54] and find and thanking you father for the
[2:52:56] rest that you have sent in this stand
[2:52:59] time
[2:53:00] lord these things
[2:53:02] has been preached
[2:53:04] for so many times in the years
[2:53:07] and father sometime
[2:53:09] instead of bringing clarity
[2:53:12] and bringing lord
[2:53:14] confidence to your children
[2:53:16] it was a source of debate
[2:53:19] a source of confusion
[2:53:22] a source of clicks
[2:53:25] a source of things that came into the
[2:53:28] broad
[2:53:29] and divided the flock load
[2:53:32] but father you drop a different
[2:53:34] anointing
[2:53:35] that is bringing everything back to
[2:53:38] normal
[2:53:39] that now we understand
[2:53:41] that it was not a matter of discussion
[2:53:45] it was not a subject for me to get a
[2:53:47] debate online
[2:53:49] it was not a subject for me to argue
[2:53:52] it was not a subject for me to sit and
[2:53:54] to prove who's right or wrong
[2:53:56] but it was actually a subject speaking
[2:53:59] about me
[2:54:00] speaking about my rest
[2:54:02] speaking about the end of my trouble
[2:54:05] thinking about speaking about the end of
[2:54:07] my enmity with you
[2:54:10] speaking about
[2:54:11] the solution to all my life
[2:54:15] the completion of my work of redemption
[2:54:18] that now i know
[2:54:21] that my life is no longer in my hand
[2:54:24] but my life is in the hand of my maker
[2:54:27] who's controlling everything and who's
[2:54:30] working everything together for my good
[2:54:34] and now we could understand
[2:54:37] why brother brother could preach the
[2:54:38] message shalom
[2:54:40] and say little brother shalom
[2:54:44] be at peace
[2:54:46] because he's here
[2:54:47] i must decrease for him to be increased
[2:54:51] because he came down the presence of
[2:54:54] christ is here jesus christ is here he's
[2:54:56] taking care of every election
[2:55:00] [Music]
[2:55:03] and there is nobody that's going to be
[2:55:04] left
[2:55:06] just like joseph father
[2:55:09] when he unfolded himself to his brother
[2:55:12] he removed
