TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] do [Music] do [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] god bless you all this evening this song we're going to do first is the one that uh andrew on sunday he was talking about it and i heard it before but i didn't necessarily know it so over the last couple days i've been listening to it trying to learn it [Music] and i believe brother branham talked about it as well it was a song that andrew said brother brandon mentioned a sister saying it and he enjoyed it and it took everything in him to stay calm and to keep in his seat so i figured we'd start the service with it this this evening and as always don't be afraid to worship don't pray the praise all day angels are watching over me my lord all night all day angels watching over me and when i went down to pray angels are watching over me my lord my soul got happy and i stayed all day [Music] [Music] to is me through amen if you get there before i do all my friends i'm coming to sit all night all day angels are watching over me my lord all night all day angels watching over and then like andrew was talking about when satan sends false teachers my way angels are watching over me my lord when he sends teachers to lead me astray angels watching over me one more time when satan sends false teachers my way angels will watch it over amen watching over me one more time all night stay all night all day angels are watching over me my lord all night all day angels watching over me amen amen i invite you all to pray with me this morning as or this evening as we open the service and when i say that i mean enter in prayer with me just pray with me this evening just ask the lord to come and be with us this evening and to give us his word we come to be fed this evening that's my desire i believe it's your desire as well so let's just bow our heads lord we come before you now thanking you once again for an opportunity to gather around your your like precious believers lord believers of like precious faith lord we thank you for the opportunity and we just pray that we don't take it for granted through the season of covet a year ago lord where the doors were shut on us and we had to have church at home lord in that season of my life it was a struggle lord and i felt a drought in my spiritual walk because i wasn't able to be in the service lord i missed it and i thank you for the opportunity now to be in your service lord to be in church to worship and praise and to hear your word and to be able to enter in lord i pray that you keep me lord involved keep me interested and keep me keep me pulling on your word i pray lord i cast the demon of tiredness out lord or distractions of the cares of the world lord i cast it out and i ask you to just come down lord minister to my heart minister to the hearts here we desire to hear from you be in the service have your way lord we pray we love you and thank you for all you do in jesus name amen amen thank you lord before this next song thank you [Applause] before this next song i just wanted to share this with the with the church um i had a friend call me and he said his dad was getting onto him about playing video games and said it was wrong because his dad is pretty hardcore as as some would say and he was telling he was he was calling me he was like man like what do you think do you think it's wrong to play games and a lot of people when they come to me with questions like that like is it wrong to play video games is it wrong to do this is it wrong to do that i mean i once like i always say brother shango you can correct me if i'm wrong but i didn't want to give them an answer of whether yes it's wrong or yes it's right or whatever um i more so i asked them i said well what are you spending all your time on because am i going to tell you you're wrong for pulling out your phone and playing a simple phone game maybe not but if you're playing phone game after phone game or getting on a playstation or an xbox and that's all you're doing then it's it's gonna be a hindrance in your walk and i believe the lord was just using me because i really didn't know what to say to him but the lord was just using me and he gave me a thought when i was talking to him and i thought about how we can all be faithful with our ties you know we work and if it wasn't for god we wouldn't have the strength to work we wouldn't have the strength to make money so we give god back ten percent which is a small number and then we're we're also supposed to offer so say we offer five ten percent whatever it is say fifteen percent and tithe and offering i was telling them i was like if you think about it god gave us the strength to work gave us the strength to make money so we get back 15 but god gives us our life each day of our life he gives us every morning that we get up if it wasn't for him we wouldn't be alive we wouldn't be in health we wouldn't be in strength so then i i was telling him and i'm saying this to me too most of all i told him i said what if we tithed and offered 15 of our time i said do i do that i was like if i'm honest with myself i don't know out of 24 hours out of the day we're not just talking about when you're awake we're talking about the entire day the 24 hours what's 10 15 of that and are we spending that amount of time with god and i started i started to get convicted in myself i'm like lord forgive me because what do you think god desires more your money or your time time spent with him and i started like i said i just felt convicted in my heart so you all keep me in prayer it's my desire to start trying to give god at least 10 if not 15 of my time every single day reading praying in the morning listening to his prophet throughout the day reading and praying at night and if you think about it 10 15 of 24 hours is not 30 minutes it's not an hour it's it's it's a couple hours and i think lord that's my desire i don't yes i can pay my tithe in my offering but am i jipping you and my my quality time spent with you because it's my desire to spend more time with him so that's why i was sharing with him i was like before you ask questions of whether this is right or wrong or whatever it may be check your check your motive check how much time you're spending with god because if god if you're if the things of the word and the lord and your walk is sitting on the side and you're playing video games and you're doing this and you're doing that like i said i'm talking to myself then i would say all those things are wrong because anything you're putting before your spiritual walk is wrong so i just i pray that you all once again you just keep me in your prayers and it's my desire to spend more time with him like i said i'm not i wasn't talking to him i told him that too on the phone i said i'm not just talking to you i'm talking to myself too but anyway i just i just wanted to share that with you all this morning and and i'll move on sorry for talking so much and today the lord just kind of gave me some slower songs he didn't give me any really fast ones other than uh that first one so just enter with worship with me and just you know just give god your very best this evening when everything falls apart praise his name when you have a broken heart just raise your hands and say [Music] and you'll take the pain away [Music] is [Music] he that is [Music] as your faith begins to grow you're not alone so how can you be lonely sing with me oh when everything falls [Music] just raise your hands and [Music] to be amen [Music] and when you feel you can't go wrong just raise your hands and say [Music] great [Music] oh if you [Music] give us pure hearts oh let us give us pure hearts let us who seeks your face [Music] a generation that seeks seeks your face of worship when it's all about you it's all [Music] i'm about lord for the thing i've made when it's all about you it's all about [Music] when it's all about you oh [Music] when it's all about you it's all about you jesus and lord i give you my heart i give you my soul [Music] and i live for you alone every breath that i take every moment i'm awake lord have your i wonder if you can lift your hands with me and sing that this evening say lord i give you my heart i give you my soul [Music] lord i live for you [Music] lord have your way in me i wanna sit at your feet drink from the cup in your hand lay [Music] this love is so deep it's more than i can stand i melt in your piece it's overwhelming listen these words the more i seek you this is a promise from the lord the more i find you the more i find you [Music] let's do that again let's do that again [Music] tell us that where you desire for more of god there's more of god to receive god put that desire in your life that god put that desire in your heart for more of him and because you desire that there's more of him to reach [Music] against you and breathe feel your heartbeat oh this love is so deep it's more than i can bear i'm melting your piece it's overwhelming i wanna sit i wanna sit at your feet drink [Music] we'll get our chances [Music] the more i see the more i find you [Music] lay back against you and breathe feel your heartbeat this love is so deep it's more than i can stand i melt in your peace it's overwhelming one more time say i wanna sit [Music] [Music] this love is so deep it's more than i

to lay back against him and breathe and to feel his heartbeat how many wants to feel the heartbeat of the lord that's my desire to sit next to him to lay my head on his chest and to feel his heartbeat the man who died for me the man who gave his life for me the man who gave everything for me so that i could be here and i could worship him and i could praise him and i could give him my very best thank you lord oh it's overwhelming church it's overwhelming to me when i start thinking about it the sacrifices he made how he came to this earth how he was an overcomer and he showed us how to be

blessed be the name of the lord everybody happy glory that's the way we want to worship him that's the way we want to get under anticipation to receive the word of god amen praise be the name of the lord how many enjoy the service on sunday amen hallelujah hallelujah that was a wonderful wonderful service if you missed you were not there you need to catch up amen don't be lagging behind make sure you miss a service catch up and let's keep moving together everybody clear we don't want to leave anything behind not even a hoof amen we don't want to leave nobody behind we make sure we all go amen blessed be the name of the lord we continue to pray for the work of the sanctuary up there the church work day and church work service so that everything continues to move smoothly and easily by the grace of god amen remember this coming sunday is going to be the second sunday of the month like we announced last sunday so we're going to be picking up the building fund offering we pick up the building fund offering twice if you want to bring it any other day that's fine but every second week and the fourth week the last week of the month so this coming sunday we will have a regular offering then at the end of the service probably we're going to pick up a building fund and we will do the same thing after two weeks in other words every two weeks bi-weekly amen if those that get paid bi-weekly can understand that amen so bi-weekly we will continue to do that everybody clear make sure for this coming sunday lords willing if you miss the wednesday service where we stop on ezekiel 23 you need to catch up and stay on top of it then we can move together if you want to come start meditating we stop in ezekiel 23 so you can meditate on ezekiel 23 and meditate on proverbs 7. if you don't understand anything just pray and the holy spirit will be moving and he will unfold what is written there we spoke about the children and we give you a solution for the kids brother branham said the solution is prayer amen now we talk about the adolescent and we have been opening a whole lot of channel with adolescents what is going on in other words we chose you we are showing you every trick of the devil brother branham said to overcome you need to know recognize the devil in any of his tricks amen so we make sure you understand what's going on you understand the process so you can embrace it easily and embrace it with christ and christ will help you cross that path amen once we get finished and clear everything there then we're going to give you a solution if you are struggling with adolescent what does brother branham say about it just like we give you a solution for the kids we're going to give you a solution for our adolescent but the first one is to make sure you receive a mark of christ in your life amen make sure once you're in that age contact jesus christ let him put his seal upon you let him put a mark upon you just like he did it for for jacob once you got his mark upon you then you know exactly that you're not going in this life journey alone but there is a big brother that is standing there who's going with you and he's going to remove the heat from the fire and make sure you cross everything safe and you make it to the other side everybody clear so that will be ezekiel 23 and proverb 7. once we finish there then we drop into menopause somebody asked me so when you talk about mediocre what about the man amen usually when god speak to his children he refer the church as a woman that's why the woman in ezekiel came up to appear to be a woman amen not a man sometimes he uses men but for the majority of the time the church has been represented as a woman amen that's why we're going to go through menopause but there is something brother brandon also spoke about the man that goes with the man so when we spoke about a ladies or when we're talking about young sister it is not only young sister also young brothers just like the sister have to keep their virtues i have a scripture a quote where brother branham shows also that the boys need to keep themselves pure everybody clear we usually point to the sister like the boys have a right to go do whatever they want to do and come again and claim sister i want a virgin you better be yourself amen you better be yourself you want one you stay like that amen blessed be the name of the lord so once we finish that then we drop into the elderly just a little bit touch and you will understand why paul say to timothy don't take a younger widow you wait only to the age one you remember that scripture you can go ahead and read it and from there we will see tonight we have brother polycarp it has been a while that he have not spoken so he will be preaching tonight i told him i'm not a man that give up especially when it comes to spiritual thing i will fight the devil until i get what belongs to me amen if it doesn't belong to me i'm not gonna fight it i'm not gonna fight to have a possession to go to hell that's not my property but everything that belongs to me i'm gonna fight it so i told him i said brother caleb we'll again translate you we want him to be trained until he can do it amen so brother caleb you dare like a warrior you come back again until you conquer all the way to the end amen the bible says the spirit of the prophet is subject to the prophet i'm there as an overseer i'm a backup i can do it but i want to train the younger one let them take care of the computer let them take care of the camera let them take care of the music let them go ahead and be involved into things that belongs to the kingdom of god it will keep their mind occupied and they're going to learn how to serve god at a younger age brother branham said if there was one regret that he has i can give you many quotes on that but branham said it's because i didn't serve the lord when i was younger so once you have an opportunity we are opening an opportunity if you're a sister you want to sing sing amen don't wait he didn't say you have to have a beautiful voice to sing the bible say make a joyful noise as long as it's a joyful nose we're gonna be singing together with you amen the more you do it the better you get if you got complex that's your problem because when we go to heaven you're going to have a problem singing amen brother branham said if you want to find him in heaven do you know where to find him he said go see where there is a choir of angel he said if you're here brother branham will be standing right there so even your prophet love music amen so young people get engaged by the polycarp we're going to call you and brother caleb will be translating so go ahead and do the best amen blessed be the name of the lord only believe [Music] only believe oh we believe all things are possible [Music] oh hallelujah give us this opportunity [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] and that was from luke five one two seven and it came to pass that as a people pass on to him to hear the word of god and stood by the lake of gib given ezra and saw two sheep standing by the lake and the fishermen were gone by them and they were washing their nets and he entered into me in this ship which was simon and prayed to him that it would cast out cast on the net i'm sorry my eyes are killed it will cross out in there and he sat down and he told the people of this ship first for now when he had left speaking unto them and he started to see men excuse me in my eyes i cannot really see and when simon answered a certainty master we have told to the soul all night and we have not yet cast nothing nonetheless at that word i will land down the net verse seven six i'm sorry and when they had um sorry i cannot really see the words are smaller my bible somebody can help me with this and when they had this done they enclosed a great multitude of fish and their net broke and they beckoned onto the partners who were in the the other boats that they should come and help them and they came and filled both boats so that they began to sink amen thank you are you listening let's pray heavenly father we come here tonight to you lord as we are put ourselves into your heart [Music] yeah get your friendly control of the twitter shows take control of everything else get your new batista defend the center squeeze us from the public [Music] may be seated of the lord jesus i sat on the wall in this place pascal before that before you came in here god was the first one that was here amen amen [Music] it wasn't your [Music] and the same god is here tonight glory to god amen is [Music] tonight for you believe in the promise of the holy spirit [Music] and he has the same obligation to you as to simon and the prophet will try to represent himself as simon [Music] and simon will longing to see the christ he believed what the word of god taught him longing desire to see the christ and he believed that he would see him comment on jesus when the deep calls on to the deeper minds [Music] but he did not have the time to measure the deep of the water and joshua in front of the jordan he also didn't have the time to measure the jordan but he believed amen amen the [Music] and they didn't have the time to measure the heat of the fire and god asks you to believe can nobody how do you feel about it he only told you to believe the prophet and the prophet said do you believe do you believe in your healing do you believe in your deliverance if you believe you will see it come to pass [Music] the same message in paragraph 40. [Music] but it's god who seeks the man [Music] no man ever saw god in the world got six the man and won the man men fell in the garden of eden [Music] no man [Music] there's glory to god if you come here only to find something to criticize you will get what you expect [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] 53 say just have faith the scripture says please go and sing no more [Music] amen amen [Music] the word of god is god himself i'll read something in the paragraph eight [Music] [Music] and the earth caught until the tree came out the prophet that was created so the earth could come [Music] children it's your fault so you have to commence that you my belly here god created you so that way you can get amen amen [Music] fishback there was no water for it so he can swim the reason why he has finn there was water for him to swim and use it [Music] everything we have exists for a purpose and for a reason [Music] i'm talking [Music] and he is eating all the carbs amen amen [Music] and he he even ate the pedal for the bike the plastic for for the pedal of your bike [Music] we didn't know what was wrong with that little child people were asking why is it why is this kid eating anywhere why is getting all the plastic [Music] in him there was a deep that was calling another deep examine the kids [Music] [Music] [Music] traditions we are in our churches all through traditional churches in the church of catholics and we are all the darkness we are all the creators but inside of us even though we were there they were at thirst somewhere they were thirst to hear the word of god to meet the lord and to see the lord and to measure god and there was that thirst inside of us amen to manifest that desire um [Music] before he died regardless of his age regardless of the time god does not deal with time he doesn't deal with the age he taught simon [Music] in this building amen amen in this precious time it's the same holy spirit who leads you and he leads the children of god who believes the promise of god you see what i'm saying [Music] [Music] and it was anna [Music] and god was obligated to show him the christ so the holy spirit moved to anas [Music] and i'll see that prophetess was blind but she had the promise of the lord so the holy spirit led her regardless of the multiple people and she went through by the holy spirit and all the way to christ hey from the christ amen amen it's the same thing that god led you to his house so that you can meet him here tonight regardless of the problems regardless of the situations tonight you're going to meet the lord god will not ask you how do you feel about it he has no need for symptoms but he wants you to say that i believe [Applause] it's the faith that says that i believe that will produce the healing that will produce the deliverance that will lead everything else that will produce all things that you need glory be to god in the program yes he's here tonight he was from the dead he gives you the promise the holy spirit has brought you here together if you weren't here tonight if the holy spirit hasn't led you here tonight you will be out there somewhere in the world [Music] because you expected to see the lord jesus christ to come into the scene and to confirm his word expectations [Music] so tonight you and me god is [Music] to respond to it and what's going to respond to it's god himself in the world [Music] it was john that saw the spirit to save their time and he says this is but john was the one that saw the spirit come upon christ amen amen he did not act of who listen to it by him he saw it and the major there follow the star and i'm gonna skip a little bit there were stars in the sky because they were waiting on him if you seek the lord tonight you will seek you will see him and jesus christ lord bless you amen there were stars amen amen is to show the power of the holy spirit amen amen the gospel is to show the power of the holy spirit and you notice what we have read in look five and jesus walked into peter's book amen amen and peter was good at fishing and he was a fishing man he knew the deep the activity of fishing by fishing and that's how he was paying his bills and that's why he spraying everything by fishing and he was doing it for many years so he was very good at what he was doing yeah and so it was it was good at all that he was doing it and all that night and he fished but he didn't receive anything and and then after that and he set aside but he didn't receive anything his wife was waiting for him in the house yes his wife was waiting for him in the house but to come to the house it was the same wife that will answer him but we have bills we have problems so how did you come empty-handed hallelujah hallelujah tell somebody else to watch their own nets so it's not it's too early for you to give up the word of god says that peter tried everything he did all these tricks that he could do and he was done there was nothing left for him to use that what is no all of his ideas he had to go back home the wife was waiting for him at home the wife was waiting for him he also had to pay the bills certainly the wife would have told him ask of him so peter and pierre and peter and it was a struggling should i go back home should i stay here and we're just walking around people just like walking around it was just walking around he was asking himself should i go back home or should i stay here should i go back home or should i stay here and it was there with his nets and as i was watching his nest slowly the son of god comes out of eternity the son of god who comes out of the eternity he was there standing in front of him and i'd say you peter you that was wonderful let's [Applause] [Music] and [Music] [Applause] you took your boat and landed unto me listen to my brother you took my time you took your time to come to church you took your house for me and then you came to your house to my house and then you playing the piano in the church you singing for me you and i know that you need a lot of effort from yourself he's just bringing everything to the surface glory be to god glory be to god you took your boat and lend it to me take your neck and cast it into the glory be to god and peter replied master we work all night you see addiction to your happiness and jesus say i know you were caught i know you were cornered on all this time that you came into the lord all the years that you spend in the message glory be to god hallelujah hallelujah god bless you satan all this time that you came into the lord you work for the lord but he's always on the surface everything that you accomplish is everything at work on the surface so what are you gonna speak about your future you have a church you built you you bought the church everything is still on the surface god have something for you it's a bigger thing than what you expected god knows that we we we bought the church amen amen but what god is saying tonight you're not going to stop contributing we're going to continue we're going to continue to give you the initials and let me tell you something just the parenthesis in the old testament people were giving offerings they were giving tithing unto me amen amen they were giving their timing do you know what happened in the new testament the believer in the new testament [Music] in the old testament they were giving 10 percent and 90 belong to you but if you go to the book of fact in the new testament the people were selling their houses to bring everything into the house of the lord so they went beyond ten percent tell me how can god not bless somebody like that tell me how can god not accomplish great things like the shadow of peter healing people because they went into the deal it is not complete because they understood the power of god amen who surveyed and you know usually we buy houses and do you buy those home for god no you buy them for your family to give it to your children but tell me what are you going to buy for christ that's just something i want you to think over about jesus seek first the kingdom of god and everything shall be added unto you tell your brother or your sister who the one who's sitting behind you your future is still more to come jesus told peter [Music] all this stampede you were working by your own strengths you were looking at your own ability to get you connected because it's your profession directly because you were going by rules those were rules of fiction we know that you were taught by your master it's just like you go to school and somebody teach you for you to be successful in life you need to do this you need to do this the medical doctor said you need to do this you need to do that and the medical doctor said you must go through this surgery you must go through this logical scientific proof this is what the life you were living before this is not what god is speaking tonight [Music] do you believe in your healing amen amen just believe in your healing and you will see the glory of god amen amen they told you if you seek with cancer if you have a female trouble or you cannot conceive second on thee those that told you the reproduction are they the one that created you son take you on for me they do the best that they can healing belongs only to god they can do a surgery performing surgery but for that surgery to heal so that everything comes back to normal that's a mystery of god amen amen that's the reason why so we want to go beyond our senses which is a realm of the spirit which is the realm of the spirit of god if you take a risk for instance if you don't take risk in life you're not going to succeed anyway because if you don't whisk you won't have anything that's the reason why i told you moses has a road but he never used that road to measure the depth of the red sea josh would never worry about how much was the deep water of jordan daniel when he faced lioness they never measure the temperature they look into the unseen unto the spirit of god so never rely on your knowledge you must take risk with god a so whatever god bring as an inspiration to you because in your future on this earth there are many realms you must reach now you need more than what you have now and you need more than the ability you are using now you need the supernatural in your life [Music] you need a supernatural to be demonstrated to you as an individual you need a specific sound for you [Music] you need a god save the lord for you elohim you need elohim you need the word that is stepping out of eternity and step inside of your flesh because our most of our blessings are still into the deep you remember in the bible anna had to go deep in her prayer life in order to receive samuel the prophet when emma started praying meme prophet [Music] when she get deep into her prayer even illa the priest could not discern what was wrong with the woman so gps the gps of ela the priest was completely lost he looked he said what is wrong with that woman maybe she's a drunk but she was not drunk with wine the problem that she had in her own life push her to go deep into prayer when anna when anna was expressing herself with groanings like oh god oh god all those are groanings those groanings even speak better than your words just one groaning for example maybe end i was saying ouch lord just that ouch lord means more to god than even the words it means that groaning of ouch have a lot of things bundled into one groaning that's why ila could not decode that kind of language amen amen glory be to god there was no future 2 2 19 19 verse 30 and the remnant that escape out of judah shall yet again take root downward and bear fruit upwards take root downward and bear fruit upward if they are talking about root going downward in other words the root must go really deep amen amen [Music] a tree that bears fruit is a tree that have the roots really deep into the ground it is that depth into the ground that brings the height of the trees if you look at this great big building this hotel if we look at this beautiful hotel amen amen la we understand the depth that the engineering have to dig first before they elevate the building it's because of the death that's the reason why it can sustain such a high tall building amen hallelujah so for you to see such a tall building you need a really deep roaded ground so when you look at the talk tree just remember the root is the one actually determining the height of control so you want to go really deep with the lord second year put towards what god has in your life it is in the deep if it's here let me take your vision a little bit you can read the home 9 to 10. but let me touch the main point descended is the same also that ascended that far above all heavens that he might feel all things because they complement tonight do you understand what i'm talking about now you'll fall apart from them so first you must descend jesus went all the way to hell and the bible said that's why the lord gave him a name that is above every other name because there is no greater name than the name of jesus christ even in the heaven there is no one that is greater than the lord jesus christ because he was the one that first descended now he ascended far above everything so the first the next move of the lord in your life the portion of benediction so the next blessing of the lord in your life the things that god have been holding for you [Music] you must take a risk to go into the deep with the lord ask the one who's been who's sitting beside you is your relationship with the lord tell me how deep are you with the lord how deep how much depth am i into the lord how much are you deep into the lord because the blessings that you have the blessings that is that for our future all of them are still into the deeper second professor what we did accomplishing this church is good we have accomplished so many things in our own life sabine that is good but what about your future amen amen we must go into the deeper amen amen where are the miracles of the lord you need miracles go into the deep with the must have a lord relationship with the lord new devils we must go into the deep amen amen if you don't take a risk with god there is no way you can possess those things that belong to you remember when a woman goes to deliver hell and so i first said the maintenance first of all they sit with a doctor and a sony and they are there completely hellenistic and they don't they are not even ashamed of the doctor amen amen not on to the person they don't even they are not ashamed of the doctor because they are under suffering there is something that must be delivered so she can even cry scream she doesn't care who's standing in front of her because she needs all the energy to go into labor because the baby have to come out they don't care who's sitting there or not they're not even paying attention to anybody [Music] and she will look at you like why are you staring at me but when she was going through labor she didn't care about who was in the room because she was injured so god wants you to be in that situation amen amen you must be into the deep tonight so let's go launch into the deeper letter everything that we did we always have on being on the surface amen amen we were we were accomplishing things on the surface all the time that you were in this message god yes he accomplished a lot of things but what about your next future now in the message what about your next future in the messages what are you going to do with this message what are the things that you must possess amen amen if you face a difficulty and you want to reach out to something but it's not working you fail just understand the decode from there that your blessings is greater benediction when you have a big blessing coming in your life [Applause] the problem of the children of god is this god already promised there is no way you can possess that even though you see those promises staring at you you will be just like uh like uh like uh like a public speaker and you will never reach out to what your name is why because you don't want to launch into it i'm here brother you must believe you must believe don't even say that i'm feeling like this it's still hurting i got a little better jesus was asking people do you want to get healed and the people answered yes lord i want to see you yes lord i want to walk yes lord i want to get here at the end after the discernment he was asking the people do you really believe that you're healing because if you don't believe it won't happen to you anyway do you believe if you believe it will happen no matter the promises of god that give you strength you must identify yourself into the world amen amen [Music] i believe that's the last scripture i believe it's in joshua something [Music] if you look at that scripture in joshua of praying basket because you would never receive that which you were asking the lord is your way now listen to this and watch here joshua jose now joshua was old yet very much land to be possessed [Music] there is still much land to be possessed for complaining do you see now don't care you let the that's but god said everything you accomplished was a serpent you must go into the people and tonight the lord wants you to go into the deep tonight god wants you to believe the word of god the eternal word of god that comes from eternity if the musician can make their way up here so that together we can pray in prayer go into the deeper shall happen to seek the face of god the three seconds therefore the tweet destroy what needed to be destroyed and the rest of the lord will take over amen amen glory be to god glory be to god no matter what people are talking about or whatever the voodoo doctor which is spoke about your life we are standing upon the blood of jesus christ which is a higher power and we are declaring that we will blossom in our life i am telling you your life will blossom just like the earth was programmed to bring for fruits you gave to speak to your womb to bring your fruits and your breasts will be announcing your children [Music] amen you must change your ways of praying amen amen if you notice when jesus was casting our devils jesus was not playing games with david he was telling the devil leave that one shut up first see do this lost but when you pray shuck it what teacher selling them every time you are casting out devils the devil even don't care about your way of praying the devil don't even care about your voice amen amen they are looking at you barking baskets because you don't recognize yourself remember joshua [Music] just think about those big walls the wall of the city of jericho maybe people could even build upon those worlds but those walls came down just boy with the future just with the footsteps let me tell you again something in the book of joshua city i believe chapter 7 if i'm not mistaken verse 3 to 6. those are not people just like this those that are leprosy [Music] there were four lepers they were handicapped in their lives [Music]

anything i believe it's second king seven instead second king chapter seven verse three to six about the jesus there were miracles during the sermon and we also wanted three years the same thing

syrians and they start walking and they start walking they start working now listen to what happened for the lord has made a host of syrians to hear [Music] even the noise of a great host elizabeth to
