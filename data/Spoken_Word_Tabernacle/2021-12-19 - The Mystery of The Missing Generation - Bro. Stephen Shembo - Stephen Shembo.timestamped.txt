[49:48] media i received texts
[49:50] left and right and i reply them all kind
[49:53] of stuff amen
[49:55] so if you came to this church a little
[49:58] bit later what i mean later
[50:00] meaning recently
[50:02] you have probably missed a lot of
[50:04] foundation that we put on
[50:07] if you're still struggling with malachi
[50:09] 4
[50:10] you go on youtube or you see one of the
[50:12] deacons we will give you i already have
[50:14] a list
[50:16] that tells you because i remember when
[50:18] we preach about the king of hazaris we
[50:21] preach like 45 sermons i have all the
[50:24] theme of it so once we begin to work on
[50:27] the website we will put up the theme so
[50:30] if you have a struggle with something
[50:31] you can just go straight but i would
[50:34] strongly encourage you if you have time
[50:36] go back to the wood sermon and pick it
[50:38] up yourself so don't say it was daddy's
[50:41] fault it was the pastor's fault it was
[50:43] the deconform it is your own fault
[50:46] everything is in your lap
[50:48] if you have a struggle with makeup it's
[50:50] there you have a struggle with hearing
[50:52] it's there you have a struggle with high
[50:54] heel it's there you have a struggle with
[50:57] christmas it's there
[51:01] amen
[51:02] if you're still struggling with
[51:04] christmas in this message it is day
[51:07] it is on part 28
[51:17] amen
[51:19] amen
[51:21] we prove to you that christmas is a
[51:23] hedonism
[51:25] clearly
[51:26] you say brother branham was doing this
[51:29] you need to read brother branham
[51:31] throughout
[51:32] his progression
[51:36] i ask somebody a question and say you
[51:38] are can you check the
[51:41] sound
[51:42] i can hear an echo
[51:44] somebody need to learn this pretty good
[51:46] when brother david is here
[51:48] if brother branham have a sermon
[51:50] preached in 1947
[51:54] amen
[51:55] how much do you expect the brother
[51:57] brother to give you there
[52:01] how much
[52:02] so if you have a sermon in 47 and
[52:05] brother brother i'm saying we're going
[52:06] to have a christmas plane
[52:08] so you're going to stuck there
[52:15] i thought somebody has said if i'm
[52:17] travel overseas maybe one day or
[52:20] somewhere or maybe in europe
[52:23] and i find a church
[52:25] that only have this
[52:27] sermon
[52:28] i won't blame them
[52:32] if they only have this
[52:34] sermon here in 1947 and that's what
[52:37] they're using
[52:38] i'm not going to blame them
[52:40] but i'm going to bring them other coats
[52:43] so it's up to them to update
[52:46] or to upgrade themselves from 47
[52:49] all the way to 65 but if they show you
[52:53] new codes
[52:54] and you still don't want to move with
[52:56] the progress of the message then
[52:58] something is wrong
[53:00] anybody care because brother branham
[53:02] have the first pool the second pole then
[53:05] the third pole and back here you gotta
[53:07] understand the progression of that
[53:10] but you cannot stick back there and say
[53:12] no christmas what do you want in
[53:14] christmas what else do you want in
[53:16] christmas
[53:17] what do you want
[53:19] gift
[53:22] even the coming down of the realm of
[53:25] abraham
[53:27] amen sure that jesus was born in april
[53:31] [Music]
[53:32] [Applause]
[53:37] you want to celebrate the birth of jesus
[53:39] christ
[53:41] [Music]
[53:42] he didn't even say for you to remember
[53:45] his birth
[53:48] [Applause]
[53:51] do you know the scripture he said
[53:53] remember his death
[53:55] not his birth
[53:57] anybody care not even his birth
[54:02] even by the zodiac he was aries
[54:06] because on the 25th he goes into the
[54:09] capricorn
[54:11] [Music]
[54:20] god brown
[54:22] he said
[54:23] then also
[54:24] they suffered
[54:26] or worshipped
[54:27] and respected the birthday of their son
[54:30] god
[54:31] that's where the 25th came from
[54:34] which was who
[54:36] you don't take the things of god and
[54:38] just swap him
[54:39] [Music]
[54:41] you need to worship god according to the
[54:44] place he wants you to worship him
[54:48] [Applause]
[54:49] if god said jerusalem everybody must
[54:53] travel to jerusalem
[54:55] you cannot say oh god jerusalem is too
[54:57] too far no no you can't say that
[55:00] anybody
[55:01] he said and it's when the sun from
[55:04] december the first until december the
[55:07] water
[55:08] the 25th it doesn't change it passes its
[55:11] water
[55:12] even in the zodiac it's wrong
[55:15] because the capricorn is a fish goat
[55:18] [Music]
[55:21] it's a creature that has a part of a
[55:24] fish
[55:24] and a part of a goat and goat brother
[55:27] branham says symbolizes denomination
[55:31] it's a denomination gospel
[55:33] those are the ones that want the
[55:35] christmas
[55:36] [Music]

[1:00:41] at the beginning he must make something
[1:00:43] beautiful
[1:00:44] once you are really deep in the kingdom
[1:00:47] then he can show you anything you can
[1:00:49] swallow it
[1:00:51] so when you watch pornography you know
[1:00:52] where you are

[1:01:43] be not afraid of them for they cannot do
[1:01:46] evil neither also is it in them to do
[1:01:49] what

[1:03:08] do you think they're doing that by any
[1:03:09] chance
[1:03:12] don't copy after stuff
[1:03:15] because everybody's doing that i'm doing
[1:03:17] it so nowadays the hair is going like
[1:03:19] this no no no before you copy that hair
[1:03:22] stop and say
[1:03:23] what is behind this hairstyle
[1:03:28] why is all the women doing this
[1:03:31] who started it
[1:03:33] watch where it starts
[1:03:35] check the spirit if everything is good
[1:03:37] fine
[1:03:38] if not you could be copying after
[1:03:40] hollywood
[1:03:43] because that's what everybody's doing
[1:03:46] all demands are doing like that why are
[1:03:48] they doing like that if independently
[1:03:51] you keep your burden while you want it
[1:03:53] fine praise be the name of the lord but
[1:03:55] don't do it out of fashion
[1:03:59] don't go do it because you were shaving
[1:04:02] yourself a certain way then suddenly you
[1:04:04] change
[1:04:04] and when i look i see every single
[1:04:07] drunkard all those the people that
[1:04:09] cusses they're doing the same thing the
[1:04:11] same thing the same thing they say and
[1:04:12] i'm wondering who are you copying after
[1:04:15] is this your normal style or you change
[1:04:18] it to be also
[1:04:22] in the time right modern
[1:04:25] so who are you following
[1:04:27] we are separate people
[1:04:31] i'm sorry man
[1:04:33] i don't like the devil
[1:04:39] i don't like the devil
[1:04:41] amen my blood and his blood don't get
[1:04:44] along
[1:04:45] [Applause]
[1:04:45] [Music]
[1:04:47] [Applause]
[1:04:48] and i don't like the devil bothering you
[1:04:53] because many people suffer out of
[1:04:55] ignorance
[1:04:58] everybody wearing tight paint you wear
[1:05:00] tight paint why do why why what comes up
[1:05:03] with thai paint
[1:05:05] you don't know why
[1:05:07] stop first and say why is everybody
[1:05:09] wearing titan
[1:05:11] we were wearing good good long long uh
[1:05:14] paint like this now the pants are here
[1:05:17] why
[1:05:19] they don't even look nice
[1:05:23] it's not even respectable
[1:05:27] why are they doing that who's behind
[1:05:29] that who's pushing that agenda
[1:05:34] if you begin to look discerning the
[1:05:36] spirit behind stuff
[1:05:38] you're going to get your hand off
[1:05:42] i can go down and continue to tighten
[1:05:44] and tighten and tighten until you feel
[1:05:46] like
[1:05:51] blessed be the name of the lord so we
[1:05:54] don't celebrate that
[1:05:57] amen if somebody's putting their
[1:05:59] christmas tree or something that's their
[1:06:01] problem not in this church
[1:06:03] amen
[1:06:04] we understand the problem we understand
[1:06:06] the prophet pretty pretty pretty good we
[1:06:09] know what brother branham say it's a
[1:06:10] hedonism
[1:06:12] amen
[1:06:16] you know
[1:06:17] rejecting jesus christ can be a very
[1:06:20] small thing like this
[1:06:22] and you find yourself in hell
[1:06:24] take the money give it to the poor he'll
[1:06:27] refuse in hell
[1:06:28] very easy
[1:06:30] i don't know what he was doing with his
[1:06:31] business in here
[1:06:34] you see what i'm saying
[1:06:36] you can cling on to something
[1:06:38] sometimes we make a big deal out of
[1:06:40] nothing
[1:06:43] why are you fasting in a marriage
[1:06:45] because she said this table need to be
[1:06:47] this way and this stable is this way and
[1:06:49] that's why you're fasting
[1:06:51] [Music]
[1:06:53] what a difference between this being
[1:06:55] this way or this way
[1:06:57] it is the
[1:06:58] devil about here
[1:07:01] and you look you say so all these
[1:07:04] bidding and all this yelling just
[1:07:06] because of that
[1:07:08] because if you look it's not really that
[1:07:11] it is

[1:11:54] isaiah 52
[1:11:57] who keep pulling like this
[1:12:01] verse six
[1:12:02] all we like sheep have gone astray
[1:12:07] we have turned
[1:12:08] everyone to his own way do we see any
[1:12:12] exception here
[1:12:14] did they say whether it's jews or
[1:12:15] gentiles here
[1:12:19] how many people
[1:12:21] no exception anybody clear
[1:12:24] verse 6 and the lord has laid on him
[1:12:28] you might be seated the iniquity of us
[1:12:32] water
[1:12:33] so
[1:12:34] everybody gone astray
[1:12:37] and the scene of everybody put it in
[1:12:40] somebody christ remember last sunday
[1:12:44] amen
[1:12:45] verse seven
[1:12:46] he was oppressed
[1:12:52] do the best that you can
[1:12:56] even if you are streaming
[1:12:59] be in church
[1:13:01] as you see the day approaching
[1:13:03] it's getting pretty bad
[1:13:05] you playing with church
[1:13:09] amen he was oppressed
[1:13:12] and he was afflicted
[1:13:14] yet he opened not his mouth
[1:13:16] he he's brought as a lamb to the
[1:13:18] slaughter and as a sheep before her
[1:13:21] shears is dumb
[1:13:23] so he opened not his mouth we know who
[1:13:26] that is
[1:13:28] philip explained the eunuch from
[1:13:30] ethiopia verse 8 he was taken from
[1:13:34] prison
[1:13:35] and from judgment
[1:13:37] and who shall declare what
[1:13:41] this man has a generation
[1:13:47] this man
[1:13:49] has
[1:13:50] he's
[1:13:53] his generation singular or plural
[1:13:58] singular okay so it's one
[1:14:02] amen
[1:14:03] who shall declare his generation
[1:14:06] for he was cut out
[1:14:08] cut off out of the land of the living
[1:14:11] for the transgression of my people was
[1:14:14] he stricken everybody
[1:14:17] let's go to romans chapter 2.
[1:14:21] we already touched on the city of refuge
[1:14:23] last sunday
[1:14:24] the high priest so
[1:14:27] get closer and we gonna
[1:14:30] take off quick
[1:14:33] roman chapter 2
[1:14:36] verse 28 if you dare you can say amen
[1:14:39] for he is not a jew
[1:14:41] which is outwardly remember
[1:14:45] not the outside jew not the man the
[1:14:47] fleshly jew
[1:14:49] neither is that circumcision which is
[1:14:51] outward in the flesh so verse 28 is
[1:14:55] speaking about the outside man or the
[1:14:57] body
[1:15:00] but verse 29
[1:15:02] he is a jew which is one inwardly hey
[1:15:08] and circumcision is that of though
[1:15:12] so there is two jews
[1:15:15] you can be a jew on the outside
[1:15:18] which none of us here is
[1:15:20] nobody here
[1:15:21] anybody
[1:15:22] or you can be a jew on the inside
[1:15:25] so if you fail
[1:15:27] the opportunity to be a jew on the
[1:15:29] outside there is only one opportunity
[1:15:32] left
[1:15:37] here
[1:15:39] the circumcision is that of the heart in
[1:15:42] the spirit and not in the letter whose
[1:15:44] praise is not of man but of who
[1:15:48] go to chapter 6.
[1:15:52] and verse
[1:15:54] nine
[1:15:57] there is two jews
[1:15:59] there is a jew on the
[1:16:04] outside i ward you and we have an inward
[1:16:11] both of them are jews
[1:16:13] but the true one is the one inward you
[1:16:16] can be the one naturally and you still
[1:16:18] go to hell
[1:16:19] verse 9
[1:16:20] knowing that cross being raised from the
[1:16:23] dead
[1:16:24] remember last sunday
[1:16:26] he had to be killed the high priest must
[1:16:28] die
[1:16:29] but he didn't stay there he had to be
[1:16:32] risen again knowing that christ being
[1:16:34] raised from the dead what
[1:16:37] dies no more
[1:16:39] it's just once anybody care
[1:16:42] death has no more dominion over him
[1:16:45] for in that he died he died to sin once
[1:16:51] but in that he liveth
[1:16:53] he liveth to who
[1:16:55] so we want the high priest to die but we
[1:16:58] still also want him to stay alive
[1:17:01] remember that sunday
[1:17:02] when he dies he's returning for your sin
[1:17:06] the high priest anybody here
[1:17:09] by death
[1:17:11] goes the atonement a bad care but when
[1:17:14] he stay alive
[1:17:16] there is a security
[1:17:19] anybody here because if he's just alive
[1:17:22] your sin is still
[1:17:24] talking your sting is alive you can be
[1:17:28] good inside the city but outside
[1:17:30] somebody can tell your story so we don't
[1:17:32] want no record outside no record inside
[1:17:35] the only way we can blot out the
[1:17:37] ordinances
[1:17:39] that was against us and nail thought
[1:17:41] ordinances in the cross the high priest
[1:17:44] must die
[1:17:45] when he dies he wipe all record amen
[1:17:49] amen and when you enter he is alive
[1:17:53] forevermore
[1:17:54] [Music]
[1:17:55] revelation
[1:17:57] chapter
[1:17:58] 1
[1:18:03] the mystery of the sea of glass
[1:18:08] you see one piece of furniture what is
[1:18:10] coming out of it
[1:18:16] verse 18
[1:18:18] if you dare you can say amen
[1:18:21] i am he that liveth
[1:18:24] and was
[1:18:26] and behold i am alive forevermore
[1:18:31] amen
[1:18:32] and have the keys of hell and of water
[1:18:36] forever this man will never die again he
[1:18:40] did it once
[1:18:41] because of you and me and once he's dead
[1:18:44] he's alive that said let's pray
[1:18:48] heavenly father lord we are approaching
[1:18:50] you again humbly father this morning
[1:18:53] thanking you for everything you are
[1:18:55] doing for us lord you walk each one of
[1:18:57] us this morning and maybe some struggle
[1:19:00] to come to church lord but you give them
[1:19:03] grace lord father to overcome that body
[1:19:06] struggle and they are here this morning
[1:19:08] father not to listen to a man but to
[1:19:11] listen to god lord we have done what we
[1:19:14] can do as far as a man that you're given
[1:19:16] an ability to read the scripture lord
[1:19:19] father but when he comes to interpret
[1:19:21] the scripture and to unfold the word and
[1:19:24] bless your children it's a work of the
[1:19:26] holy spirit that's why lord father we
[1:19:29] are humbling ourself lord and committing
[1:19:32] ourselves again once again unto the hand
[1:19:34] the speaker and those that are hearing
[1:19:36] lord may you move us completely out of
[1:19:39] the way may you be the one speaking and
[1:19:41] the one hearing and interpreting your
[1:19:43] own word lord father be the beginning
[1:19:46] and the end of this service as we commit
[1:19:48] everything unto the hand in the name of
[1:19:51] jesus christ
[1:19:52] amen
[1:19:54] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:19:56] we are on the mystery
[1:19:58] of the sea of glass we're on part seven
[1:20:01] we're still dealing with the priesthood
[1:20:03] and once we finish with that we will get
[1:20:05] into the clothing of the priest amen and
[1:20:08] the reason why i say the clothing of the
[1:20:11] priest
[1:20:12] is because the
[1:20:14] scripture says here that on verse 12 and
[1:20:17] that shall bring aaron
[1:20:19] and his son
[1:20:20] unto the door of the tabernacle of the
[1:20:23] congregation and wash them with water
[1:20:26] ever here
[1:20:27] and that shall put upon aaron the holy
[1:20:30] garment
[1:20:31] anybody clear
[1:20:32] so there is a holy government that went
[1:20:35] over aaron first and anoint him and
[1:20:39] sanctify him that he may minister unto
[1:20:42] me in the priest office and that shall
[1:20:45] bring his son and clothe them with coats
[1:20:49] so if you look right here you will see
[1:20:51] that the clothing of aaron
[1:20:54] is different than the clothing of his
[1:20:56] son
[1:20:58] did you see that so we gotta find out
[1:21:01] whoa
[1:21:02] what are the clothing of aaron
[1:21:06] and why are those clothing different
[1:21:08] than the clothing of his son
[1:21:10] and what is the anointing that came upon
[1:21:13] iran and that same anointing is going to
[1:21:15] be upon his children but what we were
[1:21:18] dealing here we found the high priest to
[1:21:21] the levitical priesthood and the high
[1:21:23] priest have children that must benefit
[1:21:25] the same thing that he did before they
[1:21:28] entered their ministry and we found on
[1:21:31] last sunday that under melchizedek
[1:21:33] priesthood we also have another high
[1:21:36] priest
[1:21:37] and that high priest his name is who
[1:21:40] few people need to stay awake
[1:21:43] the high priest his name is who
[1:21:46] now with the revelation of the high
[1:21:49] priest we found out that that revelation
[1:21:52] goes with the problem of a seed
[1:21:55] everybody
[1:21:57] now we found out last sunday that there
[1:22:00] are two seeds of abraham
[1:22:03] there is a natural seed of abraham
[1:22:06] ever here
[1:22:07] and there is also a spiritual seed
[1:22:10] of abraham and the natural seed of
[1:22:13] abraham we found out that it was three
[1:22:15] categories
[1:22:17] the first was ishmael
[1:22:19] about here the second was isaac
[1:22:23] and the third was the sons of keturah
[1:22:26] which were six of them
[1:22:28] these sons were chased away
[1:22:30] ishmael was run away
[1:22:33] the one that remained which was the
[1:22:36] the son of a free woman was isaac
[1:22:38] anybody clear so far
[1:22:40] then we read on roman the bible says not
[1:22:44] not as though the word of god
[1:22:46] you need to keep your seatbelt has taken
[1:22:48] non-effect for they are not all israel
[1:22:53] which are of who
[1:22:55] so even though we're speaking about
[1:22:57] isaac
[1:22:58] not everybody that came out of isaac is
[1:23:01] israel of god
[1:23:02] they might be israel as far as the flesh
[1:23:05] but they are not children of god
[1:23:08] and paul continued he said neither
[1:23:10] because they are the seed of abraham are
[1:23:13] they all children but in
[1:23:16] not isaac but in isaac shall that seed
[1:23:19] be called that's why we understood that
[1:23:22] isaac was not the seed but isaac was
[1:23:25] only a channel
[1:23:28] through which the seed shall come
[1:23:30] open romans chapter 3.
[1:23:34] hallelujah
[1:23:37] blessed be the name of the lord
[1:23:40] roman chapter 3.
[1:23:42] if you dare you can say amen
[1:23:44] romans chapter 3 verse 1
[1:23:47] brother stephen
[1:23:49] abraham have ishmael disqualified
[1:23:53] abraham have keturah disqualify abraham
[1:23:57] have isaac disqualify
[1:23:59] what is the benefit of being a juden
[1:24:04] why
[1:24:06] verse one
[1:24:08] what advantage then has the jew
[1:24:11] ever now
[1:24:13] we okay
[1:24:14] don't sleep you can stand back there
[1:24:16] amen
[1:24:17] what advantage then has the jew
[1:24:20] or what prophet is there of circumcision
[1:24:24] if everybody is disqualified why being a
[1:24:28] jew
[1:24:28] amen verse 2
[1:24:31] much everywhere
[1:24:33] chiefly because that to them
[1:24:36] were committed the oracles of god
[1:24:40] so paul is saying that the advantage of
[1:24:43] being a jew here the jews were the first
[1:24:46] people that god gave the law
[1:24:50] because the law only was a replica the
[1:24:53] tabernacle was a replica or a duplicate
[1:24:57] or a copy of the true priesthood so it
[1:25:01] is important to understand what happened
[1:25:04] through the jews
[1:25:05] that's why brother branham said that
[1:25:07] israel is god time peace
[1:25:10] if you want to understand god you need
[1:25:12] to understand what he did through israel
[1:25:15] that's why jesus said salvation is of
[1:25:18] the jew everybody so far
[1:25:22] job 2 verse 9
[1:25:24] amen
[1:25:26] if there is an advantage watch verse
[1:25:28] nine
[1:25:29] what then
[1:25:30] are we better than they
[1:25:33] no
[1:25:34] in no wise
[1:25:35] for we have before proof
[1:25:38] buff
[1:25:38] what and what
[1:25:41] both jews and gender that they are all
[1:25:44] under water
[1:25:47] everybody here
[1:25:48] everybody here so even if you are jew
[1:25:53] you follow me
[1:25:54] even if you are gentle paul is saying
[1:25:57] that we have proved to you that
[1:25:59] everybody is under sin
[1:26:02] anybody here
[1:26:04] in other words the children of god they
[1:26:08] claim
[1:26:09] to be a child of god
[1:26:12] doesn't lie on the color of your skin
[1:26:20] they claim to be a child of god
[1:26:23] doesn't lie on your nationality
[1:26:29] anybody here
[1:26:30] because when the realm was created
[1:26:33] remember that realm have no father no
[1:26:36] money
[1:26:39] anybody here
[1:26:40] there was no blood connection
[1:26:44] between the ram
[1:26:46] and abraham
[1:26:50] was not even blood connection
[1:26:52] between daruma and the realm that were
[1:26:56] in the flock of abraham
[1:27:00] everybody here
[1:27:02] that realm have a unique bloodline
[1:27:05] that never existed in the entire world
[1:27:10] even though he looks like another
[1:27:13] natural rhyme
[1:27:14] but he's a different species
[1:27:20] let's go to verse 10
[1:27:24] as it is written
[1:27:26] there is no unrighteous
[1:27:28] anybody
[1:27:30] no not
[1:27:32] not one
[1:27:33] anybody here
[1:27:34] there is none that understand
[1:27:37] there is none that seek after god
[1:27:40] they are all gone out of the way
[1:27:44] they are all together become
[1:27:46] unprofitable there is none that does
[1:27:49] good no not one jews and gentiles
[1:27:53] here
[1:27:54] jump to verse 20.
[1:27:57] therefore
[1:27:58] by the deed of the law everybody clear
[1:28:01] there shall no flesh
[1:28:04] so the claim is not here
[1:28:06] anybody
[1:28:08] the claim is not here
[1:28:11] that's why people waste their time to
[1:28:13] watch to see if adam was a a white man
[1:28:17] or a black man or a yellow man it's a
[1:28:20] it's unnecessary
[1:28:22] the claim of god's children is not here
[1:28:25] it is not in the blood it is not in the
[1:28:29] nationalities there is a different claim
[1:28:32] because not all that are coming out of
[1:28:34] israel are children of god so even under
[1:28:37] the jews there not all the jews are the
[1:28:40] children of god
[1:28:42] so you can put claim on the jew
[1:28:45] so where is our claim going
[1:28:48] melchizedek
[1:28:50] therefore by the deed of the law there
[1:28:53] shall no flesh be justified in his sight
[1:28:57] for by the law is the knowledge of sin
[1:29:00] but now the righteousness of god
[1:29:02] without the law everybody
[1:29:05] is manifested or revealed being
[1:29:08] witnessed by the law and the prophet
[1:29:11] anybody clear
[1:29:13] even the righteousness of god which is
[1:29:15] by faith not by the law of jesus christ
[1:29:19] to who
[1:29:22] to all and upon who
[1:29:25] and upon all them that believe for there
[1:29:28] is water
[1:29:31] no difference
[1:29:33] you can be complex when you see a jew
[1:29:35] anybody here
[1:29:36] jump to verse 23
[1:29:38] for all have done water
[1:29:41] and come water
[1:29:42] short of the glory of water
[1:29:45] jews and gentile everybody sin
[1:29:50] we clear jump to verse 29 now
[1:29:54] is he the god of the jews only
[1:29:57] is he not also the god of the gentile
[1:30:00] what is the answer
[1:30:02] yes of the gentile water
[1:30:05] everybody
[1:30:07] seeing it is one god not two
[1:30:11] which shall justify
[1:30:13] the circumcision by faith
[1:30:16] that the jews and the circumcision the
[1:30:19] gentile through faith marquee
[1:30:23] do we then make void
[1:30:25] the law through faith paul is asking a
[1:30:28] question
[1:30:29] that now what you are demonstrating
[1:30:32] brother stephen is whether we are jew or
[1:30:34] gender he doesn't matter
[1:30:37] there is no difference
[1:30:38] everybody can go to hell or everybody
[1:30:40] can go to heaven depending on who is who
[1:30:43] so nationalities whatever bloodline have
[1:30:46] nothing to even if you were born in the
[1:30:48] lungs of abraham that have nothing to do
[1:30:50] with it because jesus looked at the jew
[1:30:53] and told them you say abraham is your
[1:30:55] father but let me tell you your true
[1:30:56] father you are of the your father there
[1:30:59] devil everybody here so paul is saying
[1:31:02] that now
[1:31:03] we have a question so because of this
[1:31:06] faith that we are preaching so the law
[1:31:09] means nothing now
[1:31:11] that's what he says he's saying
[1:31:13] do we then make void in other words do
[1:31:15] we nullify do we make void the law
[1:31:18] through faith because of this faith so
[1:31:20] let's abolish the law
[1:31:23] watch god forbid
[1:31:25] yeah we do
[1:31:28] water did you get that
[1:31:31] paul is saying
[1:31:32] that the faith
[1:31:34] the children of faith
[1:31:37] do you follow me
[1:31:39] actually they don't break the law
[1:31:44] did you get it
[1:31:45] the children of faith actually are the
[1:31:49] ones that live that law
[1:31:53] in other words the children of faith
[1:31:56] this faith is what makes you fulfill the
[1:32:00] law
[1:32:04] do you follow me
[1:32:05] they gave human beings their love
[1:32:08] without faith
[1:32:10] that's why they got in trouble
[1:32:12] now faith came so that through that
[1:32:15] faith
[1:32:16] if you take that faith
[1:32:18] automatically you're gonna fulfill the
[1:32:21] law
[1:32:24] let me go slowly go to roman father
[1:32:30] once i get here through then we come
[1:32:33] if you're there you can say amen
[1:32:36] that faith that we're talking about
[1:32:38] is a faith that gives you the holy ghost
[1:32:41] ever here
[1:32:45] watch romans 5 5
[1:32:48] you there
[1:32:50] and hope
[1:32:51] makes not a shame
[1:32:53] because the water
[1:32:55] the love of god is shed abroad in our
[1:32:59] water
[1:33:01] by who
[1:33:03] by the holy ghost which is water
[1:33:06] [Music]
[1:33:09] god say love the lord lord god with all
[1:33:12] your heart with all your mind how are
[1:33:13] you going to love god
[1:33:16] [Music]
[1:33:17] because on the outside you have the
[1:33:19] black dog
[1:33:20] on the inside you have the black dog so
[1:33:23] by nature we are already enmity with god
[1:33:27] our nature cannot compar we are not
[1:33:30] compatible with god
[1:33:32] how are you going to love god
[1:33:36] anybody here so when the holy ghost come
[1:33:39] inside of you
[1:33:40] do you follow me the holy ghost is the
[1:33:43] one that brings the love of god inside
[1:33:46] of you
[1:33:48] but here that's why a man filled with
[1:33:51] the holy ghost
[1:33:53] will never stay at home
[1:33:55] [Applause]
[1:33:59] except with legitimate reason if the
[1:34:02] church is open
[1:34:07] but here
[1:34:08] because the one that make you love god
[1:34:11] the one that make you read the bible the
[1:34:14] one that make you pray they want that
[1:34:16] make you long for the message and listen
[1:34:19] to the message it is not you
[1:34:22] it is god in you
[1:34:25] [Music]
[1:34:29] everybody
[1:34:30] because if you take that man outside
[1:34:34] then the message is a burden
[1:34:39] then the message is a bunch of
[1:34:41] commandments
[1:34:43] then you are putting a skirt not by
[1:34:46] revelation but you are putting the skirt
[1:34:49] under the law
[1:34:51] [Applause]
[1:34:53] [Music]
[1:34:54] do you follow me
[1:34:56] you are taking off the earring not
[1:34:58] because god revealed to you but you are
[1:35:01] taking that because that is a religion
[1:35:05] but when the holy ghost come
[1:35:07] the love of god in your heart
[1:35:10] automatically is cleaning you up
[1:35:15] [Music]
[1:35:17] you won't force yourself to read the
[1:35:18] bible again
[1:35:20] you will feel somebody like something
[1:35:22] like i gotta read the bible
[1:35:24] you'll be sleeping on the bed and your
[1:35:26] eyes open up you look at the clock it's
[1:35:29] 3 am in the morning somebody woke you up
[1:35:33] [Applause]
[1:35:35] because he wants you to pray
[1:35:38] it is no longer you
[1:35:39] it is not you forcing to love your enemy
[1:35:43] [Applause]
[1:35:45] ever here because by human nature
[1:35:49] i foreign took for a truth
[1:35:54] but if you look at somebody you begin to
[1:35:56] love him despite what he did to you it
[1:35:58] is not true
[1:36:00] that's why brother branham said i was
[1:36:02] about to get the gun and shoot the bull
[1:36:05] until somebody come over
[1:36:08] and he begin to love the bull
[1:36:10] how can you love a bull that want to
[1:36:12] kill you
[1:36:16] this faith
[1:36:17] is what makes you fulfill the law
[1:36:21] this faith is what makes you leave the
[1:36:24] message of the hour
[1:36:30] ever
[1:36:32] ever here go to romans 13.
[1:36:40] my god
[1:36:43] amen
[1:36:47] that's why you see somebody leaving the
[1:36:49] message automatically everything is
[1:36:50] coming back
[1:36:54] something was not there
[1:36:59] something was not there
[1:37:01] amen
[1:37:03] you were fooling yourself
[1:37:05] we have man made the holy ghost
[1:37:13] if somebody is quiet by nature
[1:37:16] they want everybody that receive the
[1:37:18] holy ghost to be quiet like them
[1:37:24] if somebody is energetic by nature they
[1:37:27] want everybody that receive the holy
[1:37:29] ghost to be like them
[1:37:31] i don't need your holy ghost
[1:37:35] you don't need my holy ghost we need the
[1:37:37] holy ghost from heaven
[1:37:39] [Applause]
[1:37:45] you hear somebody you a christian so
[1:37:47] you're trying to do everything to please
[1:37:49] that person
[1:37:52] that's a good question no they're good
[1:37:53] question because they give you maybe
[1:37:55] money
[1:37:56] the day you have a problem with them
[1:37:58] they're not a good christian anymore
[1:38:04] go to roman 13
[1:38:07] i was preparing something somebody's
[1:38:09] keep pulling
[1:38:10] everybody here
[1:38:12] verse 8 if you're there you can say amen
[1:38:14] so this faith make you fulfill the law
[1:38:19] everybody here
[1:38:21] verse 8 everybody here
[1:38:24] oh no man anything
[1:38:28] you owe somebody's their money and you
[1:38:31] keep
[1:38:32] building money on your bank account
[1:38:34] that's wrong
[1:38:36] get their money give it to them
[1:38:38] brother branham say when it comes to
[1:38:39] mortgage and stuff like that we
[1:38:41] understand
[1:38:42] but don't be having somebody else money
[1:38:44] and you say wait for the next paycheck
[1:38:45] i'm gonna give it to you get their money
[1:38:47] give it to them
[1:38:49] okay
[1:38:52] oh no man anything
[1:38:55] but water
[1:38:58] that's what you need to owe me
[1:39:04] you want to owe me something owe me love
[1:39:06] [Music]
[1:39:08] and you gotta pay me my love
[1:39:13] [Applause]
[1:39:15] you gotta pay me my love in this church
[1:39:20] some of you i don't know how much you
[1:39:21] owe me
[1:39:30] you see how christianity is easy
[1:39:33] ever here
[1:39:34] oh no men anything
[1:39:37] but to love one another
[1:39:39] for he that loveth another has done what
[1:39:44] [Music]
[1:39:46] everybody here for god so loved the
[1:39:50] world
[1:39:51] that he gave his only begotten what
[1:39:55] so far
[1:39:56] let's go to verse 9
[1:39:58] for this
[1:40:00] you shall not commit adultery the law
[1:40:03] you shall not kill the law you shall not
[1:40:06] steal the law
[1:40:08] you shall not bear false witness the law
[1:40:11] you shall not covet and if there is any
[1:40:14] other commandment it is briefly
[1:40:16] comprehended in this saying
[1:40:19] namely you shall love your bro your
[1:40:23] neighbor as what
[1:40:25] paul is telling you
[1:40:27] all the tenth commandment
[1:40:30] do you follow me do not steal do not
[1:40:32] commit adultery do not do this paul say
[1:40:35] all of them are bundled up into one
[1:40:38] thing
[1:40:40] love
[1:40:43] if you love your neighbor you won't
[1:40:44] steal
[1:40:46] if you love your neighbor you won't
[1:40:48] gossip
[1:40:49] if you love your neighbor you won't
[1:40:50] commit adultery so but that love have to
[1:40:54] come by the holy ghost
[1:40:58] is he okay now
[1:40:59] watch verse 10
[1:41:01] love works no water no ill to his
[1:41:05] neighbor therefore love
[1:41:08] is the fulfilling of the water
[1:41:11] everybody
[1:41:13] but who gave you the love it's the holy
[1:41:16] ghost
[1:41:18] so this faith here is what makes you
[1:41:21] fulfill the law
[1:41:25] that's why the bible say i will write
[1:41:28] there my commandment in the heart
[1:41:31] so that they would do my way who's
[1:41:33] writing the commandment in the heart
[1:41:35] it's when the holy ghost is getting you
[1:41:37] he's bringing the love of god and
[1:41:39] automatically the law is no more a
[1:41:42] burden for you the law becomes your life
[1:41:46] amen everybody so far
[1:41:49] blessed be the name of the lord so we
[1:41:51] see here that in isaac that seed shall
[1:41:55] be called and then which are the
[1:41:57] children of the flesh these are not the
[1:41:59] children of god but the children of the
[1:42:02] promise are counted for water
[1:42:04] ever here
[1:42:06] so that was isaac now know ye therefore
[1:42:09] brother robert that day which are of
[1:42:11] faith now you understand faith the same
[1:42:14] are the children of who
[1:42:17] now you understand clear now
[1:42:19] and the scripture forcing
[1:42:21] that god will justify the hidden not the
[1:42:24] jews through faith
[1:42:26] preach before the gospel unto abraham
[1:42:29] saying indeed or nation it's not our
[1:42:32] nationalities be blessed so them there
[1:42:36] which be of faith
[1:42:38] you understand that faith now
[1:42:40] are blessed with faithful abraham now to
[1:42:43] abraham and his seed
[1:42:46] were the promises made
[1:42:48] and he said not he said not and to seeds
[1:42:51] bro as of many but as of one and to that
[1:42:54] seed which is who
[1:42:56] so the spiritual seed of abraham is
[1:42:59] christ
[1:43:00] ever clear
[1:43:02] but we showed you that christ is not one
[1:43:05] person
[1:43:07] amen
[1:43:09] christ is the high priest the high
[1:43:12] priest must have children
[1:43:16] everybody here
[1:43:17] all right when we talk about this seed
[1:43:20] since we started from a natural seed
[1:43:24] into a spiritual seed which is christ
[1:43:27] ever here the natural seed went through
[1:43:29] isaac but the true spiritual seed is
[1:43:32] jesus christ
[1:43:34] here
[1:43:34] the covenant also travel just like the
[1:43:38] seed
[1:43:41] brother branham say
[1:43:43] in a seed breath
[1:43:46] the old seed must die
[1:43:49] before the new one can be born so
[1:43:52] therefore death is hard
[1:43:55] anytime
[1:43:56] so it's painful it's distressful
[1:43:59] birth is the same because you are
[1:44:01] bringing life into the world it's
[1:44:03] painful both death and birth are painful
[1:44:07] jesus said
[1:44:09] to his word
[1:44:11] jesus said that his word was a seed that
[1:44:15] a sower went forth to soul
[1:44:17] now we are all acquainted with that and
[1:44:20] i want to teach this like a sunday
[1:44:22] school lesson because it's sunday
[1:44:25] notice then this world being a seed but
[1:44:28] remember the seed is only bringing forth
[1:44:31] a new life when it dies everybody okay
[1:44:34] [Music]
[1:44:36] that is the reason
[1:44:38] it was so hard
[1:44:40] for those pharisees to understand our
[1:44:43] lord jesus christ
[1:44:45] because they were under the law
[1:44:49] and the law
[1:44:50] was the word of god in seed form
[1:44:55] everybody
[1:44:57] but when the word was made flesh
[1:45:00] and become not the law but grace now
[1:45:03] grace and love cannot exist at the same
[1:45:07] time
[1:45:08] because grace is so far above law
[1:45:12] law is not even in the picture and
[1:45:15] therefore it's hard for the pharisees to
[1:45:19] die to the law so that grace could be
[1:45:21] born but it must go the two laws cannot
[1:45:25] exist at the same time
[1:45:28] anybody this
[1:45:31] went through the law
[1:45:33] this one came with grace everybody
[1:45:36] so we have a seed law and a seed grace
[1:45:40] but the two of them cannot exist
[1:45:42] together anybody here
[1:45:45] so that's why when jesus was introduced
[1:45:48] into the world
[1:45:50] he was not a high priest yet
[1:45:53] amen
[1:45:56] amen are we okay everybody okay
[1:45:59] he was god in flesh
[1:46:03] the priest was melchizedek
[1:46:07] but melchizedek was not high priest
[1:46:11] do you follow me everybody
[1:46:13] that's why when jesus came there was
[1:46:17] already there were already another
[1:46:20] priest present
[1:46:24] [Music]
[1:46:30] but
[1:46:31] there is a period of transition
[1:46:34] where we gotta push one high priest out
[1:46:39] to introduce the second high priest
[1:46:44] is everybody okay
[1:46:46] hallelujah
[1:46:48] where are you going my friend
[1:46:50] in matthew 8 verse 4 jesus said and
[1:46:53] jesus said unto him see that do
[1:46:56] see that tell no man
[1:46:58] but go that way show that self to the
[1:47:01] priest
[1:47:02] and offer the gift that moses commanded
[1:47:06] for a testimony unto them
[1:47:09] so even when jesus was here jesus have
[1:47:11] to go to the temple
[1:47:14] everybody here when jesus hears somebody
[1:47:17] he said you go to the priest and go do
[1:47:19] what moses did about
[1:47:21] so they thought he came to destroy the
[1:47:24] law
[1:47:26] the bible said in matthew 5 think not
[1:47:29] that i am come to destroy the law or the
[1:47:33] prophet i am not come to destroy but to
[1:47:36] do what
[1:47:37] and to fulfill meaning that the faith
[1:47:42] here
[1:47:43] that brings the holy ghost
[1:47:45] that make you fulfill the law came
[1:47:48] through jesus christ everybody here
[1:47:52] but
[1:47:52] one priest must go
[1:47:56] hallelujah
[1:47:58] in gethsemane something happened
[1:48:01] brother branham said but in that great
[1:48:03] crucial hour until he suffered knowing
[1:48:07] all things until the water and the blood
[1:48:09] separated in his body and great drops of
[1:48:12] sweat like blood dropped from his bro
[1:48:15] he died more death
[1:48:20] in gethsemane than he did on the cross
[1:48:24] anybody here
[1:48:26] in gethsemane
[1:48:28] the cup was given to jesus christ
[1:48:31] here
[1:48:32] so jesus must receive the cup
[1:48:35] or reject the cup every kill ever here
[1:48:39] when jesus accepted to receive the cup
[1:48:43] of your sin
[1:48:45] do you follow me
[1:48:46] mercy said who was inside jesus christ
[1:48:50] pull off of him
[1:48:54] you follow me
[1:48:56] jesus became the high priest
[1:49:03] are we following
[1:49:06] if you're sleeping i'm not responsible
[1:49:08] brother branham said in the garden of
[1:49:11] gethsemane the anointing left him
[1:49:16] that's why he was crying my father my
[1:49:19] father not the word melchizedek mercy
[1:49:22] why have that forsaken me
[1:49:26] the anointing left him you know he had
[1:49:29] to die as a sinner
[1:49:31] he died as sinner you know
[1:49:33] not his sin
[1:49:35] but mine and yours
[1:49:37] that is where the love comes in
[1:49:40] how he took mine oh hallelujah how he
[1:49:43] took mine
[1:49:45] everybody cared so far
[1:49:47] brother branham continued he said the
[1:49:49] spirit left him
[1:49:51] in the garden of gethsemane he had to
[1:49:54] die a man
[1:49:56] remember friend he didn't have to do
[1:49:58] that
[1:49:59] that was god
[1:50:01] god anointed that water
[1:50:04] melchizedek anointed the flesh
[1:50:08] here which was human water
[1:50:12] if he would have went up there as god he
[1:50:16] would have never died that kind of death
[1:50:19] you can kill god but he didn't have to
[1:50:21] do it but he remember he went there with
[1:50:24] you in him
[1:50:26] [Applause]
[1:50:28] anybody here
[1:50:29] everybody here
[1:50:30] because the high priest have his
[1:50:32] children
[1:50:35] everybody here
[1:50:36] god has never separated the bread from
[1:50:40] the groom yet
[1:50:42] everybody here
[1:50:43] so when god looked down upon the body of
[1:50:47] christ

[1:54:04] and leaving his own son
[1:54:13] and was laid outside the gates of
[1:54:15] jerusalem the principal city of the
[1:54:18] world at that time religiously speaking

[1:54:33] redeemed the church
[1:54:37] with his own blood everybody killed so
[1:54:40] far
[1:54:41] everybody cares so far
[1:54:43] why was he doing that
[1:54:46] because there is another generation
[1:54:51] [Applause]
[1:54:54] relax
[1:54:55] let me get to the generation
[1:54:59] other sheep i have
[1:55:03] everybody okay
[1:55:04] are the sheep i have which are not in
[1:55:08] this water
[1:55:09] where are those sheep
[1:55:12] where where is those sheep
[1:55:16] where were those sheep
[1:55:19] [Music]
[1:55:24] if i drop it
[1:55:26] do you give me time
[1:55:28] do you give me time
[1:55:30] go to matthew 27
[1:55:35] don't blame me
[1:55:38] because some have small stomach
[1:55:42] they can't finish a hamburger
[1:55:49] everybody clear
[1:55:52] matthew 27
[1:55:54] when they talk about their resurrection
[1:55:58] anybody clear verse 20
[1:56:01] verse 51 are you there
[1:56:03] and behold the veil of the temple was
[1:56:06] ranked in two
[1:56:08] from the top to the bottom
[1:56:10] and the earth did quick and the rock
[1:56:13] went
[1:56:14] and the graves were water
[1:56:17] and all bodies of descent
[1:56:25] can i repeat again
[1:56:27] all bodies of the scent
[1:56:30] why they didn't sell all the bodies
[1:56:36] why
[1:56:38] because they were other bodies that were
[1:56:40] still on the ground
[1:56:44] [Music]
[1:56:45] did you get me
[1:56:46] he only picked up the old testament sent
[1:56:50] body
[1:56:52] because if he said if he was not
[1:56:54] specific you would have pop-up already
[1:56:57] there
[1:56:58] but you have to stay there until mama
[1:57:01] begin to eat food
[1:57:06] i will show you the mystery of those
[1:57:07] body one day
[1:57:09] many bodies of the scent which were left
[1:57:12] slept deep water if you notice not all
[1:57:15] the bodies of the santa rosa
[1:57:18] only many bodies because brother branham
[1:57:21] say
[1:57:22] that our bodies here were laying on the
[1:57:24] ground
[1:57:27] anybody here so the food that mama was
[1:57:30] eating
[1:57:31] mama was pulling your body from the
[1:57:33] earth
[1:57:34] and putting you there
[1:57:36] and back here then you come out and then
[1:57:38] from heaven you jump you enter the body
[1:57:41] so jesus could not pick up your body at
[1:57:43] that time
[1:57:44] there is another fold
[1:57:46] that are there i have not gotten to them
[1:57:49] yet
[1:57:51] we okay now
[1:57:52] we okay now
[1:57:54] a mass
[1:57:56] are the sheep i have which are not of
[1:57:59] this fold
[1:58:00] them also i must
[1:58:02] it's a must
[1:58:04] i must bring and they shall hear my
[1:58:08] voice
[1:58:08] and that shall be
[1:58:11] amen
[1:58:13] we okay now
[1:58:15] watch where we going
[1:58:16] john chapter 11
[1:58:18] now we got two high priests
[1:58:21] and back here in gethsemane jesus enter
[1:58:25] his high priest ministry
[1:58:27] so one have to go
[1:58:29] because both of them cannot be at the
[1:58:31] same time
[1:58:32] do you hear me so if he is a high priest
[1:58:36] they gotta take him to another high
[1:58:37] priest
[1:58:40] to see who is stronger
[1:58:43] ever here
[1:58:44] they're not gonna fight
[1:58:46] with fist
[1:58:48] they are fighting with the world
[1:58:52] everybody
[1:58:53] and one of them named who
[1:58:56] careful being there
[1:58:59] that's that same here say unto them you
[1:59:02] know nothing at all
[1:59:05] no consider that it is expedient for us
[1:59:08] that
[1:59:10] [Applause]
[1:59:12] that how many men
[1:59:14] one man should die
[1:59:17] remember the sacrifice is the tabernacle
[1:59:20] is the service
[1:59:22] that one man should die for the people
[1:59:26] and that the whole nation perish what
[1:59:34] oh caiaphas he's wise
[1:59:37] he makes sense
[1:59:39] he's now wise
[1:59:41] let's see who was talking
[1:59:43] verse 51 and despite him not of himself
[1:59:50] but being a high priest
[1:59:52] that year
[1:59:54] what advantage is the law
[1:59:56] because the high priest must testify the
[1:59:58] death
[1:59:59] of the
[2:00:00] the lamb being high priest that year
[2:00:04] he prophesied
[2:00:06] that jesus should die for that
[2:00:11] which nation was it
[2:00:15] watch again
[2:00:17] 52 and not for that nation only
[2:00:23] i'm reading your
[2:00:24] bible ever here
[2:00:26] not for that nation only
[2:00:29] but that also he should gather shallow
[2:00:33] shallow shallow the gathering will be
[2:00:36] shallow he should gather together in one
[2:00:41] the children of who
[2:00:43] that way what
[2:00:48] everybody here that's why brother bonham
[2:00:50] said you were in him
[2:00:53] but one high priest must go
[2:00:56] because the two cannot be on the same
[2:00:58] time
[2:00:58] and they let jesus say well to the high
[2:01:01] priest
[2:01:03] they didn't understand he was a high
[2:01:05] priest now
[2:01:07] and the two seed cannot work together
[2:01:09] that's why john said i must disquise and
[2:01:12] he must increase back here and with him
[2:01:16] well assembly all the chief priests and
[2:01:18] the elders in this crowd and the high
[2:01:20] priest stood up in the midst and asked
[2:01:23] jesus saying
[2:01:25] answer that nothing
[2:01:27] what is this which the witness against
[2:01:29] it but he held his water
[2:01:32] and he answered water
[2:01:33] do you know why
[2:01:35] because everybody was lying
[2:01:38] but here they gave them money to bring
[2:01:41] false witness
[2:01:43] when somebody is lying something about
[2:01:45] you don't say nothing
[2:01:50] just keep quiet
[2:01:52] everybody
[2:01:53] amen he said and and he heard his peace
[2:01:57] again the high priest asked him and say
[2:02:00] unto him our dad they crust
[2:02:03] the son of death
[2:02:05] because you ask me who i am
[2:02:08] now my mouth is going to open up
[2:02:10] and back here and jesus said i am
[2:02:14] and you shall see the son of man
[2:02:17] sitting on the right hand of power
[2:02:20] and coming in the crowd of heaven
[2:02:23] then the high priest did water
[2:02:26] [Music]
[2:02:29] why didn't caiaphas fainted
[2:02:33] [Applause]
[2:02:34] why he didn't leave the room
[2:02:37] why did he have to rent his clothes
[2:02:40] while renting the clothes but stephen
[2:02:42] you got to detail why renting the
[2:02:44] clothes
[2:02:45] juana renting his shoes
[2:02:48] back here
[2:02:49] in leviticus 21 and he that is a high
[2:02:53] priest among his brethren upon whose
[2:02:56] head the anointing always poor and that
[2:02:59] is consecrated to put on the government
[2:03:02] shall not uncover his head nor do what
[2:03:07] everybody here
[2:03:09] remember the grace was far above the law
[2:03:12] so when the two high priests met
[2:03:14] together
[2:03:16] one disqualified himself
[2:03:18] [Applause]
[2:03:21] when a high priest read his club he
[2:03:24] disqualified himself
[2:03:27] recognizing that mercy zedek now is
[2:03:31] entering his priesthood
[2:03:32] [Applause]
[2:03:36] everybody okay now everybody okay so
[2:03:39] jesus christ made the end
[2:03:42] to the levitical priesthood
[2:03:48] romans 10 verse 4 and christ is the
[2:03:51] water
[2:03:57] you okay now
[2:03:59] christ is the end of the love for water
[2:04:03] king of selema
[2:04:05] to everyone that do what
[2:04:08] so when you come to jesus christ he stop
[2:04:11] the law
[2:04:14] if you are struggling with the message
[2:04:16] just get to christ
[2:04:20] that legalistic view of the message dies
[2:04:25] here
[2:04:26] the word which god sent unto the
[2:04:29] children of israel preaching water
[2:04:32] by who
[2:04:34] king of peace
[2:04:36] therefore being justified by what
[2:04:40] king of righteousness we have what
[2:04:44] king of peace with who
[2:04:46] through whom
[2:04:48] because he is melchizedek
[2:04:53] [Music]
[2:04:59] who has bed buff one and has broken down
[2:05:02] the middle wall of partition between
[2:05:05] water it's no more jews and gentiles all
[2:05:08] of them are my children
[2:05:11] christ made the end to the law
[2:05:14] brother stephen
[2:05:16] if jesus christ
[2:05:18] is the high priest now
[2:05:20] under melchizedek
[2:05:22] so whatever melchizedek was jesus must
[2:05:25] be
[2:05:29] everybody okay
[2:05:31] hang on
[2:05:36] king of selem i'll just show it to you
[2:05:39] he was out jesus is our peace
[2:05:41] anybody here
[2:05:43] sell him peace jesus is our peace
[2:05:46] and priest of the most high we already
[2:05:48] seen him as a priest
[2:05:50] he isn't even a high priest
[2:05:52] here
[2:05:54] who met abraham returning from the
[2:05:56] slaughter of the king and bless him we
[2:05:59] know he gave him bread and wine
[2:06:02] anybody here
[2:06:03] to whom abraham gave the tenth part of
[2:06:06] all first being by interpretation king
[2:06:08] of righteousness we saw it
[2:06:10] and after that king of salem king of
[2:06:13] peace he is our peace
[2:06:15] with our father
[2:06:17] without water
[2:06:18] [Music]
[2:06:19] so there is immortality with this man
[2:06:24] without beginning of days no ending of
[2:06:27] life
[2:06:28] let's go a little bit you ready
[2:06:31] the bible says in hebrews 7 and they
[2:06:34] truly were many priests because they
[2:06:37] were not suffered to continue by reason
[2:06:39] of death you understand this now but
[2:06:41] this man because he continued forever
[2:06:45] has an unchangeable what
[2:06:48] wherefore he is able also to serve them
[2:06:51] to the other most that come unto god by
[2:06:54] him seeing he liveth to make it a
[2:06:57] session for
[2:07:00] if melchizedek have no beginning of days
[2:07:03] no ending of life and he is immortal and
[2:07:06] eternal and the realm that abraham
[2:07:09] created no father no matter we must find
[2:07:12] the same in jesus christ
[2:07:15] you ready now
[2:07:16] hebrew chapter one
[2:07:18] verse one
[2:07:20] god
[2:07:21] who extends your time
[2:07:23] and diverse manner spec in tampa unto
[2:07:27] our father by the prophet
[2:07:29] has in this last day spoken unto us by
[2:07:33] his water
[2:07:35] so right here it looks like paul is
[2:07:37] saying we have god
[2:07:39] and we have prophets
[2:07:42] everybody here
[2:07:44] and among the prophets jesus also comes
[2:07:46] as a son
[2:07:48] and he is also a prophet he looks like
[2:07:50] god and jesus everybody
[2:07:53] by his son
[2:07:54] whom he has appointed
[2:07:57] hair of all things
[2:07:59] by whom also he made the water
[2:08:02] so if this son
[2:08:04] is not like this prophet
[2:08:08] okay
[2:08:08] this sun is a heir of everything that
[2:08:12] god have
[2:08:13] and matter of fact when god was creating
[2:08:16] the universe
[2:08:17] god was creating the universe by his son
[2:08:24] do you understand now
[2:08:26] you understand now it looks like it's
[2:08:28] god and the son but paul is saying he
[2:08:30] said no when i say son
[2:08:32] this son is different than what you
[2:08:34] think
[2:08:35] this son
[2:08:36] is the man true
[2:08:41] through whom
[2:08:43] god created everything and he owns
[2:08:47] everything that god has
[2:08:50] somebody's still struggling
[2:08:53] verse 3 this son
[2:08:55] who being the brightness
[2:08:58] of his glory and the express image of
[2:09:01] his water
[2:09:06] is he really a son
[2:09:10] philip when you see me you see the mind
[2:09:14] everybody here
[2:09:16] come back here
[2:09:17] and uploading all things by the word of
[2:09:20] his power
[2:09:22] when he had by himself purge our sin
[2:09:26] sat down on the right hand of majesty on
[2:09:28] high
[2:09:29] everybody
[2:09:30] being made so much better than what
[2:09:34] now he's higher than angel as he has by
[2:09:37] inheritance obtain a more excellent name
[2:09:41] than water
[2:09:42] [Applause]
[2:09:43] we okay
[2:09:44] now
[2:09:46] relax
[2:09:47] for unto which of the angel
[2:09:50] in other words tell me who
[2:09:52] which of the angel
[2:09:54] said he at any time
[2:09:56] die out my water
[2:09:59] this day have i water
[2:10:03] everybody here
[2:10:05] anybody here
[2:10:07] have i begotten means something that was
[2:10:09] insane about here ever begotten thee and
[2:10:14] again i will be to him er
[2:10:18] and he shall be uh
[2:10:20] oh brothers even you see it father and
[2:10:22] son relax
[2:10:24] and again
[2:10:25] when he brings
[2:10:27] in the first begotten
[2:10:30] into the word he say and let all the
[2:10:33] angel of god do what
[2:10:36] if he is different than the father why
[2:10:38] do they worship him
[2:10:42] ever here
[2:10:43] watch carefully
[2:10:44] [Music]
[2:10:47] you can freeze at this time
[2:10:52] hallelujah you can freeze at this time
[2:10:56] da
[2:10:57] oh lord in the beginning
[2:11:00] who is the lord
[2:11:04] ever here
[2:11:05] who is lord
[2:11:06] god is talking
[2:11:08] and god is saying to the son
[2:11:11] he said you lord.
[2:11:19] hallelujah
[2:11:21] that's why when jesus christ the
[2:11:23] pharisee were
[2:11:25] traumatizing him with a lot of questions
[2:11:27] he says let me ask you a question when
[2:11:30] david say the lord say to my lord who
[2:11:34] who of the two is the lord
[2:11:39] everybody here so now god is talking to
[2:11:43] somebody and he said you lord yes
[2:11:47] but here the lord in the beginning has
[2:11:50] laid the foundation of the earth
[2:11:54] and the heaven are the words of the hand
[2:11:58] everybody
[2:12:00] you son
[2:12:01] they shall perish the heaven and earth
[2:12:04] but that do what
[2:12:07] so this son
[2:12:08] doesn't die
[2:12:11] everybody here
[2:12:12] and they all shall what's old
[2:12:15] as do a garment and as a vesture shall
[2:12:19] that fold them up and they shall be
[2:12:21] changed but they are there
[2:12:24] and that year shall not work
[2:12:26] [Applause]
[2:12:30] here
[2:12:30] so their immortality
[2:12:33] is not only to the melchizedek but that
[2:12:36] immortality was crushed to himself
[2:12:40] i'm going somewhere ever here
[2:12:42] first timothy 6
[2:12:44] that that keep dick's commandment with
[2:12:47] that spot are rebukable until the
[2:12:50] appearing of our lord
[2:12:53] thank you
[2:12:54] who is this jesus christ
[2:12:56] which in his time
[2:12:58] he shall show
[2:13:00] who is there
[2:13:02] jesus christ an only
[2:13:04] [Music]
[2:13:05] potentiate and
[2:13:08] and
[2:13:10] who only has what
[2:13:12] i thought he was melchizedek that have
[2:13:14] immortality
[2:13:19] everybody okay now
[2:13:21] everybody okay
[2:13:23] him and melchizedek are like hand and
[2:13:25] gloves
[2:13:27] here
[2:13:28] he has who only there is nobody else
[2:13:31] it's only him
[2:13:32] i thought a melchizedek was god with
[2:13:35] that beginning with that and now jesus
[2:13:37] christ is the only one that has
[2:13:39] immortality so who is god who is jesus
[2:13:45] ever here who only has immortality
[2:13:49] dwelling in the water
[2:13:52] oh jesus begin to dwell in the light
[2:13:56] i thought in the old testament he was
[2:13:58] jehovah dwelling in the light
[2:14:00] that's why when paul
[2:14:02] met him in the road of damascus
[2:14:06] the pillar of saiyan he said lord
[2:14:09] in other words jehovah who are you
[2:14:11] jehovah say
[2:14:13] paul i am jesus
[2:14:18] [Music]
[2:14:18] [Applause]
[2:14:21] dwelling in the light which no man can
[2:14:24] approach unto
[2:14:26] whom no man has seen
[2:14:28] nor can see to whom be glory and power
[2:14:32] everlasting a man
[2:14:35] so jesus is fulfilling this immortality
[2:14:40] anybody care
[2:14:42] but stephen not only is he immortal
[2:14:46] but he have power of resurrection
[2:14:53] thank you my brother
[2:14:54] what are you saying buddhist people
[2:14:56] therefore do my father love me that's
[2:14:59] why the pharisee their head was spinning
[2:15:02] because i laid down my life
[2:15:07] anybody here
[2:15:08] that i may take it again
[2:15:12] because he's immortal but here no man
[2:15:15] taket it from me
[2:15:17] but i lay it down on myself
[2:15:20] this is jesus christ
[2:15:22] i have power to lay it down
[2:15:27] anybody here
[2:15:29] you want to see who you are
[2:15:32] if he's doing this
[2:15:38] and i have power to take it again
[2:15:42] this commandment have i receive it of my
[2:15:46] who
[2:15:48] so jesus can take his life and drop a
[2:15:50] day
[2:15:51] and then tomorrow he comes and pick it
[2:15:52] up again
[2:15:57] jesus answered and said unto them
[2:16:00] destroy this temple
[2:16:03] and in water
[2:16:05] god will raise it up
[2:16:10] who's going to raise up the temple
[2:16:16] [Music]
[2:16:19] ever here
[2:16:20] for us the father has led
[2:16:24] have life in himself
[2:16:26] so has he given the son to have life in
[2:16:29] his
[2:16:30] water jesus said unto her i am the water
[2:16:34] and the water he that believes me though
[2:16:38] he went dead he shall water
[2:16:40] that's why he can stand and say lazarus
[2:16:42] come out
[2:16:45] [Music]
[2:16:47] [Applause]
[2:16:50] where are we going brother stephen
[2:16:53] where are we going brother stephen
[2:16:55] melchizedek gave abraham bread and wine
[2:16:59] let's see what jesus did
[2:17:02] about here
[2:17:03] matthew 26 and as they were eating jesus
[2:17:07] took water
[2:17:09] and bless it and break it and gave it to
[2:17:11] the disciple and said take it this is my
[2:17:14] water
[2:17:15] and he took water
[2:17:17] and gave thanks and gave it to them and
[2:17:19] said drink all of this for this is my
[2:17:21] water
[2:17:23] the blood of the new have you seen
[2:17:24] anybody doing this
[2:17:27] have you seen jeremiah doing this the
[2:17:29] one who did this in the old testament
[2:17:31] that brought bread and wine is
[2:17:33] melchizedek and since then everybody
[2:17:36] quiet
[2:17:37] but when jesus came
[2:17:39] he took bread and wine and begin to give
[2:17:42] it to the people
[2:17:46] everybody here
[2:17:47] back here which is shed for many for the
[2:17:50] remission of sin but i say unto you i
[2:17:53] will not drink henceforth of this fruit
[2:17:57] of the vine
[2:17:58] until that day
[2:18:00] when i drink it new with you in my water
[2:18:03] [Applause]
[2:18:07] so when we go to the heaven we're going
[2:18:10] to have communion
[2:18:14] [Music]
[2:18:19] everybody here
[2:18:21] and when they had sung and water they
[2:18:24] went out into the mount of water
[2:18:27] that's why we sing in the lord's supper
[2:18:33] hallelujah remember this time the
[2:18:36] communion has never been instituting
[2:18:39] not until before the death of jesus
[2:18:41] christ hundred and hundred and hundred
[2:18:44] of years later but melchizedek after his
[2:18:48] chad abraham has won the victory
[2:18:50] melchizedek met him and gave him what
[2:18:54] wine and bread showing that after this
[2:18:57] earthly batter is over we will meet him
[2:19:00] in the water
[2:19:02] and take the communion
[2:19:04] and it will be the wedding water
[2:19:07] i will not drink no more of the vine or
[2:19:10] eat the fruit until i eat it and drink
[2:19:13] it with you and you in my father's water
[2:19:17] bread and one check

[2:19:27] you ready
[2:19:29] watch something here
[2:19:30] i want all of you to wake up if somebody
[2:19:33] was sleeping
[2:19:34] in hebrews 7
[2:19:37] they say melchizedek
[2:19:40] is a man whose descent
[2:19:44] is not counted from them
[2:19:47] everybody
[2:19:48] he whose dissent
[2:19:50] descent is not counted from them receive
[2:19:54] path of abraham
[2:19:56] and bless him the head the promise
[2:19:59] in other words when you take the jew
[2:20:02] genealogy
[2:20:04] you follow me
[2:20:05] and you check melchizedek you will never
[2:20:08] find him
[2:20:11] the descent the image of melchizedek he
[2:20:14] doesn't lie on the jews
[2:20:18] you follow me
[2:20:20] you cannot take the blood of melchizedek
[2:20:23] and see a jewish son
[2:20:25] because the jewish were disqualified
[2:20:28] the gentiles were disqualified
[2:20:30] all of us have seen and come short of
[2:20:32] the glory of what
[2:20:34] mercy that have neither beginning of
[2:20:36] days no ending of life he's immortal and
[2:20:39] his lineage
[2:20:42] the children of melchizedek
[2:20:44] you cannot trace them in the genealogy
[2:20:49] can i repeat again
[2:20:50] can i peter ben
[2:20:52] the high priest aaron
[2:20:54] have his children
[2:20:55] aaron enter into the high priest
[2:20:58] and introduce his children to get the
[2:21:01] benefit
[2:21:02] now we find our high priest our high
[2:21:04] priest is jesus christ
[2:21:07] but jesus is not alone
[2:21:09] jesus have his broth
[2:21:12] here
[2:21:14] here and deborah and then jesus is a
[2:21:18] priest after the order of melchizedek
[2:21:21] he have no beginning of death no ending
[2:21:24] of life he is immortal about here and
[2:21:28] the genealogy of melchizedek
[2:21:31] which was reflected in jesus christ you
[2:21:34] cannot trace it among human beings
[2:21:41] take my few chapter one all of you
[2:21:44] please
[2:21:48] matthew chapter one
[2:21:55] let me see where i am at

[2:22:13] verse one
[2:22:15] you there
[2:22:16] the book of water
[2:22:19] how many generation is there
[2:22:23] according to matthew 1
[2:22:28] verse 1 there is a book
[2:22:31] of the
[2:22:33] who shall

[2:22:38] the book of the generation of jesus
[2:22:42] christ
[2:22:44] the son of who
[2:22:46] the son of who
[2:22:48] why only those two people
[2:22:54] why they didn't say jesus the son of
[2:22:56] so-and-so
[2:22:58] they say jesus the son of david
[2:23:02] david
[2:23:04] and abraham
[2:23:07] who received the promise to bless
[2:23:09] everybody
[2:23:12] the father of us all
[2:23:14] eberkia
[2:23:16] the father
[2:23:17] of
[2:23:18] as all america
[2:23:21] they said jesus the son of david
[2:23:24] and the son of who
[2:23:26] david was a king
[2:23:28] david was a prophet
[2:23:31] and david was behaving like a priest
[2:23:37] king
[2:23:38] prophet priest
[2:23:40] ever here a prophet is called son of man
[2:23:46] a king
[2:23:48] is called son of david
[2:23:52] and the priest is son of god
[2:23:57] the generation one generation of jesus
[2:24:01] christ the son of
[2:24:03] and the son of who
[2:24:06] stay awake
[2:24:07] let's go
[2:24:09] verse two
[2:24:10] abraham that's where they start
[2:24:14] remember god
[2:24:16] preached the gospel to
[2:24:17] abraham
[2:24:20] for seeing that the hidden
[2:24:22] will be blessed through the faith
[2:24:25] so now when we start the generation of
[2:24:27] jesus christ we didn't started from adam
[2:24:30] [Music]
[2:24:31] did you see adam there normally we
[2:24:33] should start the book of the generation
[2:24:35] adam adam begat said but when they start
[2:24:39] the book of the generation they started
[2:24:41] from abraham
[2:24:44] everybody here but abraham we know that
[2:24:46] the problem of abraham is his faith
[2:24:51] everybody here
[2:24:53] watch carefully now verse two abraham
[2:24:57] father isaac
[2:24:59] and isaac father jacob let me stop there
[2:25:04] jump to verse 17
[2:25:08] so this will be easier on you
[2:25:10] anybody here
[2:25:12] so all the generations plural
[2:25:16] everybody seen that
[2:25:18] all the generation from abraham to who
[2:25:22] oh what
[2:25:25] i want you all to stay awake from
[2:25:27] abraham
[2:25:29] to 14
[2:25:30] how many generations do we have
[2:25:35] what is number 14.
[2:25:38] slow down i don't want you to get lost
[2:25:41] anybody here
[2:25:43] verse 17. so all the generation from
[2:25:46] abraham to david are 14 generation
[2:25:51] and from david until they're carrying
[2:25:55] away in babylon or how many generation
[2:25:59] so we get the first the beginning
[2:26:01] abraham one
[2:26:03] number two david
[2:26:05] number three the caring to babylon
[2:26:09] caring to babylon everybody here
[2:26:12] the caring to babylon is what how many
[2:26:14] generation
[2:26:16] so if we start abraham will be number
[2:26:19] one
[2:26:20] death it will be number one
[2:26:24] number 14.
[2:26:26] anybody okay
[2:26:28] then we start from the son of david
[2:26:30] up to this one will be 14.
[2:26:33] everybody okay
[2:26:34] relax
[2:26:36] i'm reading your bible verse 17. so all
[2:26:38] the generation from abraham to david our
[2:26:42] 14th generation
[2:26:44] and from david until they're carrying
[2:26:46] away into babylon our 14th generation
[2:26:50] and from there carrying a way into
[2:26:52] babylon to who
[2:26:54] uh how many generation
[2:26:57] so our last stop here is crust
[2:27:01] do you see any more seed after that
[2:27:04] do you see any more generation
[2:27:06] he stopped at christ the generation
[2:27:08] disappear
[2:27:10] he started abraham in which christ and
[2:27:13] they've closed the book of the
[2:27:14] generation
[2:27:16] oh so where am i at
[2:27:20] where are you at
[2:27:21] because when you look you start by
[2:27:23] abraham everybody have their name there
[2:27:26] abraham begat david david got this this
[2:27:29] then it stopped jesus christ and the
[2:27:31] clothes they say this is the generation
[2:27:33] these are the children of god that we
[2:27:36] know
[2:27:37] and we close
[2:27:38] if you are not there something is wrong
[2:27:44] did you hear me
[2:27:45] did you hear me
[2:27:46] from abraham to david how many
[2:27:48] generations
[2:27:50] from david to the carrying away how many
[2:27:52] generated generation
[2:27:54] and from
[2:27:55] there from the carrying away which was
[2:27:57] under jeconiah
[2:27:59] from the carrying away all the way to
[2:28:01] christ how many generation
[2:28:04] so jesus christ must be number one
[2:28:09] number 14
[2:28:11] 14 then you start again
[2:28:13] 1 14 which is the conair then you start
[2:28:16] again 1 14. everybody care
[2:28:20] why 14
[2:28:22] brother branham says this
[2:28:25] he said and the lamb was tested and was
[2:28:28] kept up for 14 days
[2:28:33] are we okay
[2:28:35] that's why i told you to stay awake
[2:28:37] that was two sabbaths or what
[2:28:42] one for the jews
[2:28:44] which they offered the lambing tap
[2:28:47] one for the water
[2:28:49] who has the real lamb
[2:28:53] the gentile who has the
[2:28:55] and all of them was made perfect by
[2:28:58] believing this lamb would come
[2:29:00] but he was tempted or examined how many
[2:29:02] days
[2:29:04] so we found 14 days according to brother
[2:29:07] branham it takes the edges of the jew
[2:29:09] and the gentile and combine them
[2:29:12] together so 14 days is a number of a
[2:29:15] complete circle
[2:29:18] amen everybody here so when we go from
[2:29:21] abraham to david
[2:29:23] the first circle is completed
[2:29:25] when we go to david from the caring of
[2:29:28] babylon the second circle is completed
[2:29:31] and the scale in the way of babylon to
[2:29:33] christ the third circle is completed
[2:29:36] because god is perfected in
[2:29:38] [Music]
[2:29:41] are we okay
[2:29:43] are we okay
[2:29:44] let me verify
[2:29:48] okay but before i verify let me help you
[2:29:52] with something
[2:29:53] jump again to verse 18.
[2:29:56] now the birth of jesus christ was on
[2:29:59] this wise
[2:30:00] when as his mother mary was engaged to
[2:30:04] joseph before they came together she was
[2:30:08] found with a child of the water
[2:30:11] so who gave
[2:30:13] mary the pregnancy
[2:30:17] does the holy ghost have a seed
[2:30:22] anybody here
[2:30:24] we found a woman by the name of mary
[2:30:26] they say mary have a child a baby
[2:30:29] the baby is jesus christ
[2:30:31] but the father of this baby
[2:30:33] is not joseph
[2:30:35] the father of this babies who
[2:30:40] [Laughter]
[2:30:42] everybody okay
[2:30:43] everybody okay
[2:30:44] the father is the holy ghost what are
[2:30:47] you trying to say about that
[2:30:51] hang on and i'm heading today and i'm
[2:30:53] going to job anybody clear
[2:30:55] jesus was the blood of god
[2:31:02] a created blood cell
[2:31:06] remember the realm of abraham
[2:31:09] remember
[2:31:10] he was neither jew
[2:31:14] no gentle
[2:31:15] he was god
[2:31:17] the bible said we are served by the
[2:31:20] blood of god
[2:31:21] not jewish or gender the created blood
[2:31:26] that is what if he was a jew my faith is
[2:31:29] gone
[2:31:30] if he was a gentile my faith is gone
[2:31:33] because all have sinned
[2:31:36] all are disqualified
[2:31:38] he was god he was the immortal god
[2:31:42] manifested in flesh
[2:31:44] that he created that he created a
[2:31:47] bloodshed and made his own body amen
[2:31:51] that makes the devil tremble and run
[2:31:55] [Music]
[2:31:57] why
[2:31:58] does this make the devil tremble
[2:32:01] why
[2:32:03] you know that the blood of jesus christ
[2:32:05] jesus was naked jew he was not gentle so
[2:32:07] he makes the devil tremble why
[2:32:10] so just knowing that make the devil
[2:32:12] tremble
[2:32:13] hang tight
[2:32:14] and work here
[2:32:16] that put him on the move
[2:32:18] when you see the real genuine thing
[2:32:22] praise the lord what is the real genuine
[2:32:25] thing then
[2:32:26] all i've seen you say is jesus was not
[2:32:30] jews and gentiles brother branham said
[2:32:33] if you see the real thing in other words
[2:32:35] if you understand
[2:32:37] the real meaning of that
[2:32:39] it will make the devil run away
[2:32:43] what is the meaning of this
[2:32:48] god manifested in flesh
[2:32:50] he is the blood of god therefore the
[2:32:53] life come from the germ
[2:32:56] help me up a little bit my brother
[2:32:59] hang tight
[2:33:00] whether we are white
[2:33:04] brown
[2:33:05] yellow
[2:33:06] black it does not make a bit of
[2:33:08] difference to him
[2:33:11] i'm trying to make you see something
[2:33:14] we all come from one person
[2:33:17] adam each one of us
[2:33:19] whether we are white brown black or
[2:33:22] yellow we could transfuse blood to each
[2:33:25] other and save each other's life by a
[2:33:28] blood transfusion but i am so thankful
[2:33:31] that one come
[2:33:33] who was made different from all of us
[2:33:38] anybody here
[2:33:40] there is no claim nobody can claim jesus
[2:33:43] the jews cannot claim him the gentile
[2:33:45] cannot claim him anybody
[2:33:48] and through the transfusion of his blood
[2:33:51] we live forever
[2:33:53] the lord jesus was neither jew
[2:33:56] nor gender he was god
[2:33:58] god's own blood was in him he was a
[2:34:01] created blood was not through any man
[2:34:05] the holy spirit of a shadow mary and she
[2:34:08] conceived and brought forth jesus christ
[2:34:10] the son of god the blood coming from the
[2:34:14] water
[2:34:15] was god's own water
[2:34:17] that was neither jewish blood or gentle
[2:34:21] blood it was the blood from emmanuel's
[2:34:25] water
[2:34:26] so we are so thankful for that
[2:34:30] [Music]
[2:34:33] what are you trying to say
[2:34:36] everybody here they say
[2:34:39] degeneration the book of degeneration of
[2:34:42] who
[2:34:43] jesus christ the first one was abraham a
[2:34:46] jew
[2:34:49] david a jew
[2:34:52] jacob and i are a jew
[2:34:54] but jesus christ doesn't belong to their
[2:34:58] genealogy
[2:35:05] did you hear me
[2:35:06] melchizedek his genealogy you cannot
[2:35:10] trace it among human beings
[2:35:13] anybody here
[2:35:15] so by this we can find that jesus
[2:35:20] doesn't belong to this jewish genealogy
[2:35:27] because the blood of jesus christ was
[2:35:30] not from a jewish father
[2:35:32] abraham
[2:35:34] has human blood
[2:35:36] david has human blood for him from his
[2:35:39] father jacob and i have human blood but
[2:35:42] jesus christ brother branham said god

[2:39:19] of her dad had been the wife of who
[2:39:23] another woman there what's her name
[2:39:25] bad shaver
[2:39:28] a woman jew or gender
[2:39:31] bathsheba was a jewish gender
[2:39:34] he was a wife offer you right at the
[2:39:36] high tide
[2:39:41] a water
[2:39:43] four gentle woman
[2:39:45] and the fifth one is a jew
[2:39:47] why for gentle women
[2:39:54] are we okay
[2:39:55] hang on and i dropped the brain
[2:39:57] are you there
[2:39:59] it has been done
[2:40:01] in all ages
[2:40:03] but mary believed god
[2:40:05] and she said behold the hands made of
[2:40:08] the lord she believed the word
[2:40:11] how is she going to heaven she know that
[2:40:14] hagar had a baby by sex desire with
[2:40:17] abraham and sarah had a baby by sex
[2:40:20] desire with abraham children of promise
[2:40:23] the bones woman and the free woman but
[2:40:25] her here she is asked to believe
[2:40:30] no more sex
[2:40:32] it is of faith
[2:40:33] here
[2:40:34] that is a contribution
[2:40:37] to the faith that was in abraham
[2:40:41] who believed the impossible
[2:40:44] as long as god said it so that makes it
[2:40:47] work so every single woman sex desire
[2:40:51] marry faith
[2:40:54] everybody here
[2:40:55] brother adam say you see the samaritan
[2:40:58] was actually from my last sermon was
[2:41:01] edgar
[2:41:03] a perverted time the jews was what
[2:41:06] was the sarah height and the gentile is
[2:41:09] of who
[2:41:10] the royal seed abraham royal seed mary
[2:41:14] tapped the gender because of her faith
[2:41:17] [Music]
[2:41:19] everybody
[2:41:20] because she believed
[2:41:23] something that is impossible and never
[2:41:26] happened before
[2:41:28] it is the same thing abraham did
[2:41:32] so number one
[2:41:34] gentile two gentile three gender four
[2:41:38] number of deliverance gender fifth grace
[2:41:41] seed of faith
[2:41:44] are we okay
[2:41:45] are we okay
[2:41:47] hallelujah
[2:41:49] give me a few minutes and i'll let you
[2:41:51] go
[2:41:52] everybody clear
[2:41:53] mary was not the seed
[2:41:56] she was only the carrier
[2:41:58] she was only the shack
[2:42:01] to the seed the two other were carrier
[2:42:04] of life only natural seed agar and the
[2:42:07] other one mary was not the seed herself
[2:42:10] but like faith in god's word brought a
[2:42:13] more real image of the word because he
[2:42:16] was the word
[2:42:18] but like the shack of white a corn of
[2:42:20] wheat the shack hold the wheat inside of
[2:42:23] it and protect it until it's able or
[2:42:26] matured to go on its own then it was the
[2:42:29] seed itself that left her just like the
[2:42:32] seed was in her womb she was not the
[2:42:35] seed she didn't produce the seed god is
[2:42:38] the seed
[2:42:39] now the blood then many people think
[2:42:42] that it was jewish blood that we were
[2:42:45] saved by and some of them said well we
[2:42:48] got a right through the gender because
[2:42:51] who
[2:42:53] a woman there and roof moabite and so
[2:42:56] forth they were gentle you have no claim
[2:42:59] at that at all
[2:43:01] neither one he was neither jew or
[2:43:06] the fact that these women were gentile
[2:43:09] here give us no claim
[2:43:12] because the blood comes from the man
[2:43:15] but he was telling us
[2:43:17] there is something with the gentiles
[2:43:20] and mary showed that what really will
[2:43:22] come through the gender it doesn't have
[2:43:25] anything with sex
[2:43:26] it comes by faith
[2:43:28] by believing the impossible
[2:43:32] ever here
[2:43:33] so where are we in this generation
[2:43:37] where are we
[2:43:38] over here we check we found 14
[2:43:41] generation
[2:43:43] and our names are not there
