[27:51] and the first thing brother abel
[27:52] mentioned here he didn't even know
[27:54] probably why he mentioned it
[27:56] brother branham say in the message
[27:58] ordination but david give me more
[28:01] so we can blast that devil out
[28:04] amen we want to assembly
[28:08] and gather ourselves together
[28:11] in other words we need to go to church
[28:14] we want to set under the teaching of
[28:17] our brother here brother neville who was
[28:20] the pastor
[28:22] and partake of the things that is of god
[28:26] as he funds them from who
[28:30] amen he gives them out
[28:33] and we want to learn of god and seeing
[28:36] the day approaching
[28:38] we must assembly ourselves more of
[28:41] together we must love
[28:45] in our heart to do water
[28:49] let me repeat it again we must love in
[28:52] our heart to come
[28:54] to church
[28:57] hallelujah if we don't love
[29:00] church comma love who
[29:04] so there is a problem coming together
[29:07] what we call church is coming together
[29:10] to do what
[29:12] to worship see if we love christ we
[29:14] worship
[29:15] again you imagine a man
[29:18] saying he loved his wife and he had not
[29:22] seen her for a long time
[29:26] amen except you have a legitimate reason
[29:31] how can you say you love god and for a
[29:34] year and a half
[29:36] you've never been in church
[29:40] amen i'm just reading brother branham
[29:43] he was delivered to me and i'm just
[29:45] delivering that
[29:47] as he was delivered to me amen
[29:50] he said for a long time pass rabbi
[29:54] and say well i shall see her some other
[29:56] time
[29:57] see that is not it or wife saying she
[30:00] loves her husband
[30:02] or parents saying they love their
[30:03] children well it
[30:05] shows in other words your love can be
[30:08] seen
[30:09] by your life and the things that you do
[30:11] and i think
[30:12] our expression that we should constantly
[30:16] long to be in water you must
[30:19] constantly long to go to church
[30:24] that's why david say i am happy when
[30:27] they tell
[30:27] when they told me let's go into the
[30:29] house of water
[30:33] anywhere to worship the lord when each
[30:36] other
[30:37] seek for a church when we come together
[30:40] to worship him worship him at home
[30:44] worship him while we are driving our
[30:46] cars
[30:47] wherever we are worship the lord just do
[30:51] what
[30:52] so remember it's important to be in
[30:55] church
[30:56] genesis chapter 3.

[32:18] saw that the tree was good for food
[32:22] and that it was pleasant to the eyes
[32:26] remember this tree is pleasant to the
[32:28] eyes
[32:30] and a tree to be desired that causes
[32:32] lust
[32:33] to make one water like we said before
[32:37] this tree of the knowledge of good and
[32:40] weak and
[32:41] evil this tree of the knowledge of good
[32:44] and evil
[32:45] got wisdom
[32:52] you know we're dealing with wisdom right
[32:54] there is also another wisdom

[33:03] eat and gave also to her husband with
[33:06] her
[33:06] and he did what to eat let's go
[33:10] to proverb chapter 30.
[33:14] this tree can be eaten
[33:19] the fruit of it can be eaten where is
[33:24] that tree so
[33:26] we see where the fruits are
[33:30] amen proverbs 30
[33:34] if you dare you can say amen you will
[33:37] need your bible today
[33:38] because we're going to travel with that
[33:40] wisdom up and down
[33:41] up and down amen amen
[33:45] proverbs 30 verse 20. if you dare you
[33:48] can say amen
[33:51] such is the way of who
[33:54] you might be seated such is the way of
[33:57] an adulterous
[33:59] woman remember peter and paul
[34:03] showed to us how many women two women
[34:06] the first one is a good one a good woman
[34:11] which we know is the bride right
[34:15] and in that woman there is a wisdom
[34:20] and her wisdom is who
[34:23] thank you and there is another woman
[34:27] which is a bad one
[34:29] amen but this one is an adulteress
[34:37] amen now verse 20
[34:41] such is the way of an adulterous woman
[34:46] she does water you see that eating
[34:51] you see the eating in genesis 3
[34:54] verse 6 the fruit was good
[34:58] for food and it was eaten amen
[35:01] and brother branham explained the
[35:02] serpent seed that he was not an apple
[35:05] tree
[35:07] an apple fruit or whatever it is amen
[35:10] now in proverbs uh proverbs 30 verse 20
[35:14] the bible says that an adulterous woman
[35:17] eaten
[35:19] she's not eating with her mouth amen
[35:23] in case somebody is missing it such is
[35:26] the way
[35:27] it's her way of an adulterous woman
[35:31] she eats kama and wipe her mouth
[35:35] come on and say i have done no water
[35:39] she can commit adultery and there is no
[35:42] guiltiness
[35:48] no guilt zero it's gone anybody clear
[35:52] let's go to james chapter three
[35:58] paul two women peter two women
[36:02] a good one and a bad one
[36:05] and we found out that wisdom is a woman
[36:10] she has a house built with how many
[36:13] pillars
[36:16] amen if you don't know that i would
[36:18] worry
[36:21] seven pillars fresh kill
[36:25] remember that plus wine
[36:28] stimulation of revelation remember that
[36:31] and she have a table of seven course
[36:34] meal
[36:37] amen glory to god
[36:41] james chapter 3 verse 13 if you dare you
[36:43] can say amen
[36:46] hallelujah blessed be the name of the
[36:49] lord
[36:49] who is a wise man
[36:55] and undo with knowledge among you
[36:59] let him show out a good conversation
[37:04] his works with meekness and water
[37:08] wisdom we want to see the life of that
[37:10] wisdom
[37:11] we don't want to just say we was in our
[37:14] mouth
[37:14] but our lives are saying certain things
[37:17] amen
[37:19] because wisdom is a person we want to
[37:21] see that person
[37:22] that life verse 14 but if you
[37:26] have bitter envy and strife
[37:29] in your heart glory not in other words
[37:33] bust
[37:33] not and lie not against the truth
[37:37] in other words no matter what you're
[37:38] saying god knows the condition of your
[37:41] heart
[37:42] don't fool yourself and don't boast amen
[37:46] verse 15 this wisdom the wisdom that
[37:50] have
[37:50] a wicked heart it's a wisdom
[37:53] but that wisdom have a wicked heart
[37:56] remember the woman in uh proverbs 7
[38:00] had a wicked heart which the bible
[38:03] called as a
[38:04] subtle heart which is the heart of the
[38:06] serpent
[38:07] am i clear this wisdom
[38:11] descend not from above
[38:14] so there is a wisdom that is from this
[38:17] earth
[38:18] and there is a wisdom that is from above
[38:21] but the wisdom that is from above is
[38:23] found only
[38:24] in the bride because the bride becomes
[38:28] christ
[38:29] and christ is the wisdom in the bread
[38:32] that's why paul said that ye are wise in
[38:35] christ
[38:36] ever clear but there is another wisdom
[38:40] that is not from above but it's a wisdom
[38:43] that is coming from the earth
[38:45] it is an earthly wisdom
[38:50] specialized in sex
[38:55] amen this wisdom descend not from above
[39:00] but is water earthly and water
[39:04] essential based on feelings all about
[39:07] this world
[39:08] everything every song everything they're
[39:12] doing
[39:12] is just about women everything
[39:16] around women amen
[39:20] it's essential
[39:25] and is what devilish coming from the
[39:28] devil
[39:29] for where envy is where envy and strafe
[39:32] is
[39:33] there is water and god is not the author
[39:36] of confusion
[39:37] and every evil work verse 17
[39:41] but the wisdom that is from above is
[39:43] first water
[39:45] pure then water peaceable then
[39:50] gentle and easy to be water you're not
[39:53] a difficult person to deal with
[39:57] amen you could be difficult before your
[40:01] conversion
[40:02] but when you become in quest your
[40:05] conversion
[40:06] will change your makeup and you are easy
[40:10] and treatable
[40:12] amen full of water
[40:15] and good water without partiality no
[40:19] favoritism
[40:20] and without water hypocrisy and the
[40:24] fruit of righteousness
[40:26] is sown in peace of them that make water
[40:29] blessed be the name of the lord let's
[40:31] pray now
[40:33] heavenly father lord we thank you again
[40:36] for your grace
[40:36] your love your mercy father and for
[40:39] everything you have been doing for us
[40:42] thank you lord father for the testimony
[40:44] and how you working
[40:45] in a marvelous miraculous way lord in
[40:48] the life of your children
[40:50] delivering blessing feeling changing
[40:54] transforming bringing closer to you lord
[40:57] and many other things that we can code
[41:00] that you are doing in the life of your
[41:01] children
[41:02] father we thank you for this opportunity
[41:05] and we are committing ourself
[41:07] unto the hand father may you move us
[41:09] completely out of the way
[41:11] may you come down tonight again lord
[41:13] father to bless our soul
[41:15] and minister to us lord may every
[41:17] demonic spirit
[41:19] that is contrary to your word be
[41:21] completely out of this place
[41:23] may the devil and his wisdom be sealed
[41:26] out lord
[41:27] but may only the wisdom of the bread
[41:30] which is christ be sealed in lord
[41:32] may you speak to us lord in a powerful
[41:35] way tonight lord
[41:36] as we commit everything unto the hand in
[41:39] the name of jesus christ
[41:41] amen god bless you all we are continuing
[41:45] on our subject
[41:46] we are on part 30. everybody cleared so
[41:49] far
[41:50] now when we spoke on sunday there was a
[41:54] quote that i want to rehearse again
[41:57] and brother branham says in that quote
[41:58] that if you want to know
[42:01] what condition the church is
[42:04] watch the way women act
[42:07] she is the church in other words
[42:10] whatever you see
[42:11] among the women it's nothing else but a
[42:14] spiritual
[42:15] reflection on what is going on among the
[42:18] churches amen
[42:19] but we know that we always have two
[42:22] churches
[42:23] we have a good bride and we have a false
[42:26] bride
[42:26] and we have a good vine and we also have
[42:29] a bad vine everybody clear
[42:31] so see how immoral indecent
[42:35] watch look where the church is at just
[42:38] watch it
[42:39] see just watch women you see where
[42:42] how your women degrade and become so
[42:46] polluted
[42:47] that is the way your church is
[42:50] the natural condition of a woman
[42:53] is exactly the anointing that is on the
[42:56] church anybody clear
[42:58] that's why when the gospel comes it
[43:01] seems like the gospel is
[43:03] too hard on the women because when you
[43:06] change the women
[43:08] it is automatically giving you the stage
[43:11] or the
[43:12] temperature of a church everybody clear
[43:15] if the women are worldly something is
[43:17] wrong
[43:18] with the word that has been preached in
[43:20] that church
[43:21] amen blessed be the name of the lord
[43:25] in revelation 17 verse 1
[43:28] to verse 6 the bible says that so he
[43:31] carried me away
[43:32] in the spirit we went through this into
[43:35] the wilderness
[43:36] and i saw a woman this is a prostitute
[43:40] sit upon a scarlet color beast we
[43:43] explained that
[43:43] on sunday full of the blast name of
[43:46] blasphemy
[43:48] having water just like
[43:51] the bride had seven pillars
[43:54] this woman also has seven heads
[43:59] what are these heads amen because the
[44:03] pillar
[44:03] of the bread are the foundation of the
[44:06] brother
[44:07] this is where the bird sits amen
[44:11] upon the gospel of the messenger amen
[44:14] she has seven heads and ten horns
[44:18] and the woman was arrayed in purple
[44:21] and scarlet color if you remember paul
[44:24] and peter gave us a characteristic
[44:27] that's number one she bred her hair
[44:29] oh she played it there everybody clear
[44:32] number two costly apparel
[44:35] everybody clear number three it's gold
[44:38] and number four is pearl everybody clear
[44:42] and now the woman was arrayed in purple
[44:46] and scarlet which is
[44:47] checking the gold the coast apparel and
[44:51] deck with gold gold is right there
[44:53] and precious stone and pearl it's right
[44:55] there but if you watch right here
[44:58] pio john does not give us
[45:01] a description of the hair of the woman
[45:06] paul and peter gave us the description
[45:09] of a prostitute in their time
[45:12] ever clear in their time
[45:16] ever clear but when john described
[45:19] a prostitute woman john is kind of
[45:23] omitting
[45:24] the condition of her hair so how
[45:28] are we going to know what to do amen
[45:31] and deck with god and precious stone and
[45:34] pearl
[45:35] having a golden cup in her hand full of
[45:38] the abomination
[45:39] and the filthiness of her fornication
[45:43] that is the spirit upon the churches and
[45:46] upon
[45:47] her forehead was a water this woman
[45:51] has a name we want to know who she is
[45:55] she has a name what is your name
[46:00] her name is water if the name
[46:04] is a mystery how are you going to know
[46:06] it
[46:08] amen she has a name but that name
[46:12] is a mystery so that name need to be
[46:15] decoded anybody clear because what they
[46:19] say
[46:19] is mystery babylon de water
[46:22] babylon only tell you from where abraham
[46:25] came out
[46:27] which is the foundation of our faith
[46:30] amen
[46:30] in other words upon this woman there is
[46:34] a babylon
[46:35] a babylon anointing or a
[46:38] hidden or a pagan
[46:42] anointing do you follow me
[46:45] but her name is still under a mystery
[46:49] amen so to understand this woman better
[46:54] we must be able to decode the name of
[46:57] that woman
[46:58] anybody clear so far brother branham
[47:01] says
[47:01] this in the exposition of the church
[47:04] ages
[47:05] he says a mystery requires water
[47:09] teaching of the spirit or it never
[47:12] become water
[47:13] so if you want to know the name of this
[47:16] woman
[47:17] you need to be taught by the anointing
[47:20] of god
[47:21] to be able to decode that woman and
[47:24] once you know the name you can identify
[47:27] who that woman is and once you identify
[47:30] who the woman is you will look at the
[47:33] characteristic of that woman
[47:35] and it's gonna tell you the end time
[47:37] condition upon the churches
[47:40] everybody clear so far how we need to
[47:43] hear from god
[47:44] and lay ourselves open and become
[47:47] yielded to the spirit to hear
[47:49] and to know in the exposition of the
[47:52] seven church ages in the tartarian
[47:54] churches
[47:55] brother branham say in this tartarian
[47:58] church age
[47:59] she is a water so this woman
[48:03] this prostitute has a dominating spirit
[48:08] a dominating spirit upon a woman is a
[48:11] curse
[48:13] ever clear it's a curse
[48:16] you can dominate verbally or you can
[48:19] dominate silently
[48:21] the domination verbally is a woman that
[48:24] is so
[48:25] expressive but another one don't talk so
[48:28] much
[48:29] but she can behave a certain way to make
[48:32] you do exactly what she wants you to do
[48:35] everybody clear praise the name of the
[48:38] lord
[48:38] she is the mystery water
[48:42] what is that mystery is mystery
[48:44] babylonian emma
[48:47] she is the great water so
[48:50] this woman is an adulteress she's a
[48:53] prostitute
[48:54] she is who you need a
[48:58] prophet to decode the name of the woman
[49:02] so the anointing on the end time church
[49:06] the anointing that is upon every single
[49:10] church in the world except
[49:14] the bread of jesus christ is the
[49:17] anointing
[49:18] of jezebel so you need to go
[49:21] back in the bible check who jezebel is
[49:25] what did jezebel do so you're going to
[49:27] understand
[49:28] why the women are behaving the way they
[49:31] are behaving
[49:33] because the name was a mystery it took a
[49:36] prophet to unfold the mystery
[49:39] everybody clear so far she is a great
[49:42] hole
[49:43] she is jezebel the false water
[49:47] so there is a prophetic also anointing
[49:50] here
[49:51] it's a false prophetic anointing here
[49:55] what is going on a prophetess why
[49:59] because the true female is submissive to
[50:03] god
[50:05] christ is ahead we saw that on sunday
[50:08] she has no word but what
[50:12] no thought but what no leadership but
[50:16] what
[50:17] because christ is the head christ think
[50:20] for her
[50:21] christ talks for her christ lead her
[50:24] but what about this church
[50:29] she has cast out the water so
[50:32] once you take the word of god the pillar
[50:36] of the day
[50:37] the message of your time once you
[50:40] rejected
[50:42] automatically you are reflecting
[50:52] jezebel
[50:54] why is worthiness following
[50:58] it's a spirit of jezebel amen
[51:02] she cast out the word destroyed the
[51:06] bibles
[51:07] and worthy essay of the godly
[51:11] every brochure every sermon
[51:14] that is godly from the messenger she's
[51:17] going to destroy them
[51:21] amen she has slammed those
[51:24] who would preach the water it's an
[51:27] anointing that attack
[51:29] good preachers
[51:37] amen it's an anointing that is
[51:41] after good preacher to kill them
[51:44] spiritually
[51:46] before you know it this one dead this
[51:49] one
[51:50] dead this one dead by being dead
[51:53] this one also rejected the word this
[51:55] pastor also rejected the word
[51:57] this pastor also rejected the word it is
[52:00] jezebel
[52:01] killing her amen
[52:04] she has taken over kings
[52:07] prince is a nation control armies
[52:11] and insists that she is the true body
[52:14] of christ and that her pope are the
[52:18] vicars of christ she is
[52:21] entirely seduced by the water
[52:24] by devil until she turns
[52:27] she in her turn in turn has become the
[52:31] seducer of what
[52:33] once that anointing hits you you become
[52:36] the
[52:37] agent of satan once eve
[52:40] at the fruit she took that fruit unto
[52:43] adam
[52:45] she is the bride of who just like the
[52:49] bride
[52:50] is the bride of christ this woman
[52:53] is the bride of satan
[52:58] am i clear she is the bride of satan
[53:03] she has produced his bastard
[53:06] chad religion everybody clears so far
[53:10] so this prostitute of revelation 17
[53:14] is nothing but jezebel
[53:17] so if jezebel is going to appear
[53:21] on the end time no wonder elijah
[53:24] also must appear on the end time because
[53:28] the two
[53:29] work together that's why i must send you
[53:32] elijah the prophet because the anointing
[53:35] of the end time church is gonna be
[53:38] jezebel the one who knows how to handle
[53:41] jezebel
[53:42] is the spirit of elijah because that's
[53:45] where
[53:46] the wisdom of god is to protect you from
[53:49] jezebel they know each other
[53:53] jezebel and elijah knows each other
[53:56] amen when jezebel is on the scene
[53:59] you can bring anointing after anointing
[54:02] she can resist but once elijah come
[54:05] because elijah will kill the prophet of
[54:08] bow
[54:09] jezebel killed the prophet of god elijah
[54:13] also killed her prophet
[54:14] by the sword he takes the message of
[54:17] elijah to destroy the nomination
[54:22] hallelujah blessed be the name of the
[54:25] lord
[54:26] now we continue she has a name written
[54:29] the name is what a mystery what is her
[54:32] name tonight
[54:34] where does brother branham get that name
[54:40] revelation 2 verse 20
[54:44] notwithstanding this is the church of
[54:46] tartarian
[54:47] i have a few things against you about
[54:50] here
[54:51] because they have suffered that woman
[54:54] water
[54:55] jezebel in the church ages everybody
[54:57] clear
[54:59] which called herself a water to do what
[55:03] when a woman is a preacher she's under
[55:06] jezebel anointing every single woman
[55:11] that preaches the word
[55:13] that are called pastor in denomination
[55:16] they under the anointing of jezebel
[55:20] that's why paul attacked that anointing
[55:23] that a woman should not take authority
[55:25] upon men
[55:26] but it's jezebel who gave the woman the
[55:30] god to preach the gospel
[55:34] hallelujah to teach
[55:38] and to seduce because he became certain
[55:40] agent
[55:41] to seduce my water to commit what
[55:45] fornication and to eat things sacrificed
[55:48] unto adam and i gave her a space to
[55:52] repent of her fornication
[55:54] and she repented water it's an anointing
[55:58] once he hit somebody pretty good
[56:00] you're gonna have a hard time bringing
[56:03] that person
[56:04] back to god because once the word of god
[56:07] has been enlightened to somebody
[56:10] if they reject that word they crucify
[56:13] christ the second time afresh and there
[56:16] is no more redemption
[56:21] hallelujah behold i will cast her into a
[56:25] bed
[56:26] and then that coming to otto adultery
[56:30] with her
[56:31] into great water tribulation you
[56:34] remember that question
[56:36] you remember that question okay except
[56:39] they repent of their deeds
[56:42] verse 23 i will kill her water
[56:47] so this woman has children
[56:52] jezebel has children
[56:56] everybody remember she is a church
[57:01] she is the bride of satan she also have
[57:04] children
[57:05] i will kill her children with death
[57:10] and all the churches shall know that i
[57:13] am he
[57:13] which search of the ranks and heart and
[57:16] i will give
[57:17] unto every one of you according to your
[57:20] work
[57:21] now in matthew chapter 11 verse 19
[57:25] the bible says the son of man came
[57:28] eating and drinking and they say
[57:31] behold a man glutenous
[57:34] and a wine bible and a friend of
[57:37] publican
[57:38] and sinner but
[57:41] wisdom is justified of her what
[57:44] so just like this woman have children
[57:48] wisdom also have children
[57:53] ever clear praise be the name of the
[57:56] lord
[57:57] galatians chapter 4 verse 26 but
[58:00] jerusalem which is above is free
[58:03] which is the mother of water you are
[58:06] birthed
[58:07] into jerusalem from abroad which is the
[58:10] bride of jesus christ
[58:12] and the bride is the wife of christ and
[58:15] the wife have a children
[58:17] so when you are born again in christ you
[58:19] become a child of
[58:21] wisdom amen just like when you under
[58:25] jezebel religion you under her anointing
[58:29] as a child that's why she is the mother
[58:33] of her lord she is a prostitute
[58:37] her children also are prostituted
[58:40] christ is wisdom and christ children
[58:43] also are what
[58:44] wisdom ever clear blessed be the name of
[58:48] the lord
[58:49] let's continue so she is the mother of
[58:52] harlot
[58:53] she have children an abomination
[58:56] of the earth let's see exodus chapter
[59:00] 19.
[59:01] the bible says here we went through this
[59:04] that now therefore
[59:05] if you will obey my voice indeed and
[59:08] keep my covenant

[59:42] abraham
[59:43] that was supposed to go to the jews turn
[59:46] and went into the gentile

[1:12:00] by the 144 water
[1:12:03] thousand which were redeemed from the
[1:12:06] water
[1:12:07] that's why they can sing those songs but
[1:12:10] now watch something
[1:12:11] these are dead which were not
[1:12:15] defiled with what what protect
[1:12:19] them against women
[1:12:23] are you there what protect the hundred
[1:12:26] and forty four thousand
[1:12:27] against women it is the same anointing
[1:12:31] that protect the blood
[1:12:33] aggress women when it goes to elijah
[1:12:36] back to the jewish people
[1:12:38] that anointing will also protect the
[1:12:41] hundred
[1:12:42] and forty four thousand not to defile
[1:12:45] with women
[1:12:46] ever here not to defer with women for
[1:12:49] their
[1:12:50] what they kept themselves virgin
[1:12:54] what are women
[1:12:57] glory to god amen
[1:13:00] in the message gabriel instruction to
[1:13:03] daniel
[1:13:04] john could not understand them but he
[1:13:07] looked back
[1:13:08] and he saw on my sana we just read it
[1:13:11] glory a hundred and forty four thousand
[1:13:14] that had not been defiled with water
[1:13:18] women they were jews women means water
[1:13:22] everybody here which churches
[1:13:28] they had not joined no water
[1:13:32] come on lutheran camera methodist camera
[1:13:36] baptist camera and presbyterian
[1:13:38] in other words there is a message that
[1:13:41] will come
[1:13:42] that will block them from going under
[1:13:45] the nomination
[1:13:47] amen so they have been protected against
[1:13:51] the women of the day
[1:13:53] why are they protected against the women
[1:13:56] because the anointing upon the churches
[1:13:59] is a jezebel anointing it's a killer
[1:14:03] anointing it's an anointing of
[1:14:05] fornication
[1:14:06] it's an anointing of adultery if an
[1:14:09] anointing
[1:14:10] of satan she is the queen of satan
[1:14:15] if you're sleeping stand up there i
[1:14:17] don't want to call your name
[1:14:19] everybody clear amen blessed be the name
[1:14:22] of the lord
[1:14:23] now this spirit that you see moving
[1:14:27] anything today just like a government
[1:14:30] a church or anything it is controlled by
[1:14:33] water
[1:14:35] you understand now organization are
[1:14:38] controlled by what
[1:14:41] church organizations are controlled by
[1:14:44] spirit
[1:14:45] churches are controlled by spirit
[1:14:49] individuals are controlled by spirit
[1:14:53] nations are controlled by spirit
[1:14:56] and spirit was made before the cosmic
[1:15:00] mother and life in other words
[1:15:02] you must be careful which church you're
[1:15:05] going
[1:15:05] in because churches
[1:15:09] carry spirits
[1:15:14] hallelujah expectation
[1:15:18] there is not two holy spirits there is
[1:15:21] only one's holy spirit the bible said by
[1:15:23] one spirit
[1:15:24] and if the holy spirit is in churches
[1:15:28] leading people he will lead them all the
[1:15:31] same and then you will know whether your
[1:15:34] church was right or not
[1:15:36] it shall compare with the leading of the
[1:15:40] holy spirit in the
[1:15:41] beginning the way you did that the first
[1:15:44] place because god
[1:15:45] does not change hallelujah
[1:15:50] what about i'm saying about the choosing
[1:15:52] of the brand
[1:15:53] he said the same apply by choosing a
[1:15:56] church
[1:15:58] now you must pray over the church that
[1:16:01] you are
[1:16:02] following you you are fellowshipping in
[1:16:05] remember churches carrier
[1:16:08] spirit that's why you must be careful
[1:16:12] not to fall under a church that has a
[1:16:14] jezebel
[1:16:16] spirit are you there
[1:16:19] what makes you choose the church
[1:16:23] what makes you choose a pastor we begin
[1:16:26] to choose pastor by our feelings
[1:16:32] oh my god now i don't want to be
[1:16:36] critical
[1:16:36] but i realize i'm an old man and i got
[1:16:39] to live here
[1:16:40] one of these days and i got to answer at
[1:16:43] a day of judgment
[1:16:44] for what i'm well for what i said
[1:16:46] tonight or
[1:16:48] any other time and i therefore i got to
[1:16:51] be
[1:16:51] dead earnest and truly convicted
[1:16:55] by you go into a church and you watch
[1:16:58] the behavior of that church
[1:17:01] you just watch the pastor a while
[1:17:05] and you shall usually find that the
[1:17:08] church act like the word
[1:17:10] that's why the pastor must stay with the
[1:17:14] word
[1:17:15] so the church will act like the world
[1:17:21] hallelujah sometime i wonder
[1:17:24] if we just don't get one another spirit
[1:17:27] instead of the holy spirit you go to a
[1:17:31] place
[1:17:31] where a pastor is a real radical and
[1:17:34] carrying on
[1:17:35] you shall find out the congregation is
[1:17:37] the same way
[1:17:38] it shall bring you to a church where i
[1:17:41] see a pastor stand
[1:17:43] jerk their heads back and forth you
[1:17:45] watch the congregation
[1:17:47] they do the same thing you take a pastor
[1:17:50] that just gulp
[1:17:51] down anything usually the church will do
[1:17:54] the same thing
[1:17:55] so if i was choosing a church
[1:18:01] hallelujah i choose a genuine
[1:18:07] because jezebel is raging on the end
[1:18:09] time
[1:18:11] i choose a genuine camera
[1:18:14] fundamental come on full gospel come on
[1:18:19] baby church camera if i was choosing one
[1:18:23] to put my water
[1:18:25] people choose church with other
[1:18:28] different
[1:18:29] condition
[1:18:32] you choose a church because your friend
[1:18:34] is there
[1:18:37] you choose a church because your wife
[1:18:39] friend is over there
[1:18:41] you choose a church because your
[1:18:42] children friends are over there
[1:18:45] you choose a church because the pastor
[1:18:48] is an african
[1:18:50] you choose a church because the pastor
[1:18:53] is a white man
[1:18:54] you choose a church because the pastor
[1:18:56] is a black man
[1:18:57] that is the wrong choice you must pray
[1:19:01] and let god send you to a church where
[1:19:04] you belong
[1:19:06] are you there what are people choosing
[1:19:10] for
[1:19:11] they can preach the world they don't
[1:19:12] care they care about their friends over
[1:19:14] there
[1:19:15] they care about that family over there
[1:19:17] what about if your friend
[1:19:18] lives what are you gonna do
[1:19:22] there was a man i knew leaving another
[1:19:24] state
[1:19:25] moved to north carolina amen
[1:19:28] got in trouble in north carolina want to
[1:19:31] leave and go back to the state
[1:19:33] he wanted to he said brother stephen can
[1:19:36] we go
[1:19:36] i said no i won't go with you if the
[1:19:39] lord sent you he didn't say anything to
[1:19:41] me
[1:19:42] he went back over there and got in
[1:19:44] trouble again
[1:19:45] now he's in another state being a pastor
[1:19:48] again
[1:19:50] if i would have followed that person
[1:19:53] where would i be today
[1:19:55] amen god deal with gentile
[1:19:59] individual amen
[1:20:03] you must have a personal relationship of
[1:20:07] your life
[1:20:08] and the church you going to not
[1:20:11] church because somebody goes no church
[1:20:14] because mama goes
[1:20:15] no church because of your preference
[1:20:22] it's a shame you watch what people are
[1:20:24] doing in the message
[1:20:26] hallelujah i have went into meetings
[1:20:29] i want to ask you something you go in a
[1:20:32] meeting
[1:20:33] a pastor that jerk his head watch
[1:20:35] everyone in the congregation
[1:20:37] jerk the hand you go to a meeting
[1:20:40] that's a pass to a real wildfire run
[1:20:43] about you watch everyone in the
[1:20:45] congregation
[1:20:46] act the same way but you go in a place
[1:20:50] where a pastor is a solid gospel teacher
[1:20:54] all hell will never move the church
[1:20:58] [Music]
[1:20:59] that's why we must stay with the world
[1:21:02] we must repeat what the prophet say
[1:21:05] because that is the manner that is
[1:21:07] needed for the bride
[1:21:12] hallelujah blessed be the name of the
[1:21:14] lord
[1:21:15] i saw the woman drinking with the blood
[1:21:18] of the saint
[1:21:20] and with the blood of the martyr of
[1:21:22] jesus christ she's a killer
[1:21:24] and when i saw her i wonder with great
[1:21:26] admiration
[1:21:29] and here is the man which has the water
[1:21:33] that which don't back again with elijah
[1:21:36] everybody clear the seven heads
[1:21:40] all seven weapons just like the bride
[1:21:44] have
[1:21:45] seven pillars make sense
[1:21:49] this woman also have seven heads which
[1:21:52] are seven mountains
[1:21:57] which are seven foundation
[1:22:02] what are your foundation the seven heads
[1:22:05] are seven mountains on which the woman
[1:22:08] sitteth
[1:22:09] that's her foundation the bride is
[1:22:11] sitting upon
[1:22:12] seven pillars here also have seven
[1:22:15] mountains
[1:22:17] what does he mean brother stephen how
[1:22:20] many hills
[1:22:22] how many cities in the world though that
[1:22:25] the church sits on seven hills
[1:22:27] only where is that at
[1:22:32] the vatican city in rome
[1:22:35] the bible said that this horrible hole
[1:22:38] that made all the world commit
[1:22:40] fornication
[1:22:41] and brought a bunch of little daughters
[1:22:44] her children
[1:22:45] to teach about the same thing she did
[1:22:48] they become carrier
[1:22:50] they was not bad as hell but they were
[1:22:52] harlot
[1:22:53] taught them the same thing the beginning
[1:22:56] of it
[1:22:57] will be a woman or a church sitting on
[1:22:59] seven hills in home
[1:23:01] i have looked all over the world tell me
[1:23:04] where it is
[1:23:04] a church sitting on seven hills
[1:23:08] there is only one city that i know of
[1:23:11] there is two cities
[1:23:12] that are north that has seven or more
[1:23:15] mountains in it
[1:23:16] cincinnati is one of them which is
[1:23:19] supposed to be a fiction story of
[1:23:20] cincinnati
[1:23:21] it's mother wolf we know what a wolf is
[1:23:25] but he has more than that in there but
[1:23:28] there is
[1:23:28] one church dominate there is not
[1:23:32] there is no one church dominates
[1:23:34] cincinnati
[1:23:36] so that's not the choice there is only
[1:23:38] one place in the world
[1:23:40] in the whole world that has a church
[1:23:42] setting on seven hills
[1:23:44] that dominate the entire world that
[1:23:46] church is what
[1:23:47] roman it's an anointing that hates
[1:23:51] elijah
[1:23:56] the anointing of jezebel it's an
[1:23:59] anointing that is against elijah
[1:24:03] it is an anointing that hates the
[1:24:06] message of the hour
[1:24:08] when you see a church begin to hate
[1:24:11] the message of the hour you better get

[1:24:20] your relationship with christ
[1:24:22] and destroy all your christianity that

[1:24:35] going back to wearing makeup
[1:24:37] you're going back to work to wearing
[1:24:39] pants

[1:24:43] killed
[1:24:46] amen they hate elijah
[1:24:49] it's the anointing of jezebel in
[1:24:52] revelation 18 the bible said how much

[1:39:12] athlete to run and you eat junk food all
[1:39:15] the time
[1:39:16] if you want to win the race you must
[1:39:18] watch your diet
[1:39:20] you must watch what you drink you must
[1:39:22] keep your body
[1:39:23] correctly you must keep your body under

[1:39:46] but we and water
[1:39:50] so there is a corruptible crown

[1:39:56] said the one that delivered you the
[1:39:59] crown of glory
[1:40:00] which is incorruptible his name is
[1:40:02] wisdom
[1:40:05] here i therefore someone not as
[1:40:09] uncertain
[1:40:10] so fighter not as the one beating the
[1:40:13] air
[1:40:14] he's not only running but he's what
[1:40:17] fighting
[1:40:19] it's a wall with the black dog
[1:40:22] and i keep under my what
[1:40:25] why paul have to worry about the body
[1:40:31] why because paul received the holy ghost
[1:40:35] the black dog was kicked already out
[1:40:38] from the inside
[1:40:39] but the black dog was still remaining in
[1:40:42] the body
[1:40:43] that's why paul was crying that when i
[1:40:45] want to do good
[1:40:46] evil is with me so when i run there is
[1:40:49] evil running with me
[1:40:51] so there is one person that i must
[1:40:53] control
[1:40:55] when i'm going into this race when i'm
[1:40:58] going into this fight
[1:40:59] i must control my body
[1:41:04] i keep under my body and bring it into
[1:41:07] what
[1:41:08] suggestion let by any means when i have
[1:41:11] preached to others
[1:41:12] i myself should should find i should be
[1:41:15] a
[1:41:15] castaway i don't want to lose it myself
[1:41:18] i don't want to just be a preacher
[1:41:19] i want to enter myself there festivity
[1:41:23] that therefore endure hardness
[1:41:26] as a good soldier of jesus christ

[1:41:33] himself with the affair of what
[1:41:36] that he may please him who has chosen
[1:41:39] him to be here
[1:41:41] you cannot be into the world
[1:41:44] and love the world and the things of the
[1:41:46] world
[1:41:47] when you try to win this race
[1:41:51] because it shows that the love of god is
[1:41:53] not even in you
[1:41:54] and if a man also strives for mastery
[1:41:59] yet it is he not crowned
[1:42:03] except he strives lawfully you must
[1:42:05] follow the word
