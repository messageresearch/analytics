release all the tension amen amen and I believe we are the bride of Christ amen the bride of Christ amen doesn't know Christ just by the Garment amen but we know Christ in the deeper secrets of the tithe amen so when we come to him just like a wife seated uh together with a husband the wife can just put a arm around the husband the wife can touch any part of the husband's body amen so we just

amen I believe we are all priest and King seated here amen so we just I I just want to I may humbly say you're are welcome to face with the King of Kings tonight amen amen amen can we be out standing even as we take the scripture amen yes amen I'm still here trying to act as a trustee Amen to test out this equipment amen amen Lord help us amen but I believe we'll be fine tonight amen amen amen amen forgive me Pastor I have to start before you come on Sunday amen amen it's a test amen amen so want to read take our scripture reading [Music] amen amen uh scripture reading from Isaiah amen 55 Isaiah 55 we start reading from verse 7 to 11 amen Isaiah 55:7 it said let the wicked forsake his way and let the unrighteous men his thoughts and let him return unto the Lord and He will have have mercy upon him and to our God for he will abundantly pardon amen can be seated tonight amen amen he will abundantly pardon amen I we continue with the reading amen he said for my thoughts are not your thoughts that's neither are your ways my ways sayth the Lord for as the heavens are higher than the earth so are my ways higher than your ways and my thoughts than your thoughts for as the rain cometh th down and the snow from heaven and return it not thether amen but WTH the Earth and maketh it bring forth andb that it may give seed to the so and bread to the eater amen so shall my word be that goeth forth out of my mouth it shall not return and and that's where we are getting tonight it shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish that which I please and it shall prosper in the thing where to I sent it amen may the Lord add his Blessing to the reading of the word amen and and I want us to look at it tonight it said it shall not return that's right so the word is there is a return When the Lord is saying something it is coming back to him amen and he saying that it is not coming back to him empty it is not void he shall accomplish whatever he pleases amen so my my title for tonight amen amen yes sir is as sending and a receiving post amen descending to ascend amen the prophet said something that he said the way up is down now the emphasis is not the down but the emphasis is up cuz he's giv us the way up amen so when you are going down know that there is an up the reason why you were going down is because you have to go up amen so many times we look at the downside the downside and our minds get off the upside the reason why God is saying you are going down is because he wants to take you up the reason why the Lord descended is that we should that sent amen the Lord didn't descend to come and look at us in in in in in that low State low state of sin but he came down so we can be like him amen amen so I want to take this um quote again as I did the last time amen sry all right all right I'll just I'll just do it that we amen amen thank you Pastor amen so it said um from the message show us the father amen said and then when Jesus Christ spoke these words they never die that's right amen science claims in many years from now they can pick up the literal voice they'll be able to pick up the literal voice of Jesus and I believe there are vessels tonight amen that can pick up those literal voice of Jesus and I see them seated here tonight amen cuz these vessels are the receiving end of what God has sent amen amen it said there be able to pick up the leral voice of Jesus is still in the earth cuz see it's a sending post so the prophet said you are so it is not just God that is sending God has also called us as ambassadors to send Amen to speak again his word amen it said then there has to be a receiving post so what what want to look at tonight is that you are sending and also you are receiving so a sending post and a receiving post amen that is what we are speaking about tonight amen it said it's real to you and it will live just like it was then that's right amen now we take John 6 31 amen so John chapter 6:31 just to prove something amen tonight amen John 6:31 to35 amen he said our fathers did it manner in the desert amen as it is written amen he gave them bread from Heaven to eat then Jesus said unto them verily verily I say unto you Moses gave you not that bread from heaven but my father giveth you the true bread from heaven for the bread of God is he which cometh down from heaven and giveth life unto the world then said they unto him Lord everm more give us this bread and Jesus said unto them I am the bread of life he that cometh to me shall never hunger and he that believeth on me shall never test amen so we see here that Jesus is saying I am the bread of life am amen so he that cometh to Jesus get gets access to this bread amen so we who have come to Jesus we have gained access to this bread amen so now it's no longer Jesus Jus who is the owner of this bread but you and I also own this bread now we go to Ecclesiastes chap 11 verse1 thank you Lord so remember we are owning the bread now Ecclesiastes 11 verse 1 it said cast your bread cast thy bread upon the waters for thou shallal find it after many days so Jesus Christ being the word that is given to us now we own that word and the word of God is saying let us cast that bread that's right and after many days that bread will come back to us exactly right so remember the word of God said that it shall not return to me void so this same bread that God has he give to you and I and he said cast it upon the waters and it will never return to you void am amen am it shall accomplish every purpose that he God pleases so when we please God whatever we speak shall be accomplished amen amen amen still in a testing mode amen amen so just as we know when when um Christ said except the corn of wheat amen falls to the ground it abideth alone amen God does not want to be alone amen so God is sending this same bread to you and I to do the the same thing that he does amen amen amen so now we uh we read this message uh going beyond the camp amen now the prophet uh before this paragraph amen I'm reading paragraph paragraph 74 amen amen but before then the prophet talked about the fact that um the word of God come to the prophets amen right and since the prophets become the word of God Amen the people try to normally do things their own way amen he said God gave them the word God gave them Prophet God gave them miracles signs and wonders referring to Moses amen but they wanted their own Camp they wanted to do their own thing so God asked Moses to separate himself amen so because of that the word of God becomes a stranger amen so the prophet becomes a stranger to these people and they try to put him out they try to kill him amen but braah is saying here that he said now we find out that he dwelt then among his prophet he then become a stranger to them amen for he dwells only in his word that's right to confirm it so when the word is being spoken God dwells without word to confirm it remember he's given the word to you now it is not just he alone speaking but he has also given us the word to speak and and the prophet is saying that God dwells in his word to confirm it amen so the Bible said that he watches over his word to confirm it so it is all about the movement of his word it is not the situation or it is not even the people amen but it is where the word is that is where God is amen amen am he said he is trying to find someone yes brother amen so he's watching over the word and trying to find someone when someone become the vessel to pick up this word amen that word will accomplish his purpose in that person amen he said um talking about Samson he said he was a half-hearted man amen he gave his strength to God Amen and gave his heart to the lilac say like it's like uh like um an insurance policy when you get an insurance policy you might as well get full coverage amen and that's what this Blessed Assurance does for us it's a full coverage policy amen so God dwells in full coverage so when God says I'm going to heal you I'm going to provide for you I'm going to protect you it's a full coverage amen he's not going to do just one and leave the other that's why I don't believe that when God heals me amen that's the end of it no when God heals me it means he's also going to bless me with other stuff amen amen when God heals me he's also going to protect me because God doesn't do things halfway amen he doesn't just do half and leave the other half amen when God blesses you amen he's going to continue to bless you until there's an over flowing amen amen he said it covers all we have need of here in this life and our resurrection and eternal life it includes everything it includes everything so the prophet said in the same message he said you know a sheep a sheep don't have to have but one thing to offer and that's wo amen and now he's not asked to to produce or to manufacture so what you are speaking what we are sending out we are not supposed to manufacture it amen amen it said he asked to Bear wool Amen to Bear it it is a part of you amen and because it was a part of you that was why it came out of you amen the word has to be a part of you to come out of you amen amen so we are not asked to manufacture something we are asked to Bear the fruit of the spirit amen so that that that's the inside of the ship that he is on the inside makes the wool on the outside amen amen we take this message desperations amen sir it said now the word plainly states if you want to put this down in Galatians 56 that faith worketh by love right amen amen now we um just want to say this when we send something out right there is a target that's it let's say I have a telephone call amen I don't just pick up the call and then speak into the air there is a target that I'm speaking to and before it gets to that Target there has to be an attraction there has to be something about that Target that will pick up the message that I'm sending across amen let's take um like a telephone when I take my telephone to make a phone call to brother khma amen my target is brother khma amen and if let's say maybe sister Co pick up the call amen that is not really my target amen so that is that that that it it is is not going to accomplish whatever I wanted to do it's just like you have all this uh phone calls coming to you now now amen so now now now technology have gotten to that stage where it is no more somebody talking to you but it is a robot amen that is looking that that that that is trying to trick you amen so artificial intelligence have gotten to that point amen that when you say hello then they know that it is you talking when you just keep quiet it is just going to hang up amen amen cuz why they have a Target they have something they trying to hit at that's right amen so before you get to that Target there is an attraction about that Target that picks up whatever is being sent amen amen amen so one of this attractions is What U we are trying to talk about right now yes sir Philippians 4:4 amen read it the last time amen Philippians 4 amen Philippians 4:4 he said rejoice in the lord always and again I say rejoice amen what does rejoicing do rejoicing believes that the thing is already done when I am rejoicing now when I get something right now when when let's say sister Kayla gives me a gift right now I'll be happy because I got a gift amen so anytime I rejoice it means I already have it so if even I don't have it and I am rejoicing it means that I already have it amen that is an attraction to the word that I already sent amen so that becomes the attraction to my receiving post I love this part of it it said rejoice in the Lord rejoice in the Lord Lord now uh looking at Ephesians 6 where it said U train up your child in in the Lord amen and and when you go to uh verse four it's talking about the fathers to nurture amen and to kind of admonish them in the word of the Lord I'm trying to paraphrase that so in actual fact the training of the child in the Lord or by the way of the Lord is leading the child by what the word of God has said so when I am rejoicing my rejoicing is in the word what exactly the word says is what I am rejoicing so he said always Rejoice so my rejoicing is what the word of God has said even in the bad time I'm rejoicing because the word of God has said this amen the promises of the Lord do not change even in the bad times amen amen let's let's just say that this is Brother set amen um we know brother Set uh maybe Bret lives uh in U Charlotte amen so when you see brother set in Charlotte amen that is brother set amen when you see brother set in henville that is brother set amen when you see brother set in Gastonia that that doesn't change brother said I just changed the environment amen so when I'm going through a trial it doesn't change me amen amen because I still remain the same it's just the condition the environment has just been changed amen that is why I keep rejoicing because the it was just the environment that changed but I never changed amen nothing is going to change me amen amen amen amen amen we're still testing this out amen amen is the same brother said amen is the same brother said amen and even if this thing gives any problem is the same brother said preaching tonight amen amen [Applause] amen yes sir yes sir amen amen glory to God yes sir so we are back here amen amen so Hebrews chapter um 13 verse 15 said we should continually offer sacrifice of praise so it's a continuous process right praising the Lord for what he has done amen we are not praising the Lord because we saw it done but he said continually continually means there's no end to it amen so it said rejoice in the lord always it is a continuous process so I'm praising the Lord even if I'm in a a hard time amen because I am not changing amen cuz the word of God is with me amen wherever I am going that's where the word is going cuz he's watching over his word amen so we are talking about attractions amen I said now the prophet said now the word plainly states if you want to put this down in Galatians 5:6 that Faith worketh by love now when I'm am rejoicing is an expression of faith because I am speaking something that the Lord has done for me even if I didn't see it amen and he said you can the prophet said you Faith worketh by love that's right it is when I have it is when I love something that that is where you see me talking about the thing when I really love something when I really want to have a mention amen I'll will keep speaking about that mention when I want to get married to a lovely husband or a sweet wife I am going to keep speaking that because that is what I love amen it's it's just like some people who who don't um like roaches or spiders amen when they even hear the word roaches they don't even want you to say it because there's no for it but when somebody loves steak or somebody loves chicken or somebody loves shmp amen at the sound of shrimp amen the person want you to keep talking about shrimp amen cuz cuz there's the love for it so Faith worketh by love it says see Faith work by love and the only way that you can have faith is have love first amen because after all faith is Love's incentive amen amen now from this message the sudden secret growing away of the church now we are talking about love or faith working with love as a form of attraction to whatever we spoke amen the prophet said in this message said I think now of what Paul said when he said there's a crown of righteousness laid out for me that the Lord the righteous judge will give me at that day and then he stopped said did you notice and said not only me but to all them that love his appearing if we love his appearing amen So when you say something or when you speak something if you really love that thing to appear amen it is going to appear to you amen it said them that love his appearing so the Rapture is for those who love the appearing of the Lord it is not for those who are frightened when we talk about Rapture it is not for them amen amen it is for them who love the appearing of the Lord the prophet say usually in the word today that people think of the appearing of the Lord as a horrible Dreadful thing right said oh that word might come to it he said don't talk to me about that that they will say I I I was talking to my brother-in-law one time uh talking to him about the end time amen and he said is it the end of the end just just uh by the mere fact that you talk about Rapture amen it just scares them to to to that core that he said is it the end of the End Amen we are the end time amen whe whether it's the beginning of the end or the end of the end it is the end time amen amen he said they don't care about them just for the present day living but those who love the Lord love his appearing amen so when when I love healing amen I am going to love it to appear you know people people talk about um their conditions of depression and all those stuff and I am this I am that and I'm struggling like this and this and that and every time they talking about this and oh my goodness amen H you can ask my wife I just can stand that amen amen amen oh my so you see the the more they talk about those things the more they love it cuz you see you talk about things you love right amen so if this is my sickness this my sickness this my sickness it it's because you love that sickness that's why you keep talking about it amen amen instead of saying this my sickness say this my healing amen amen so you see the sickness and said this my healing amen you see all those troubles you say this my blessing amen amen amen cuz when we talk about those things that is the attraction that brings the Fulfillment to our lives amen amen so you know um I I didn't want to go into this but I'm just just trying to bring it up amen you know those times um when my wife was going through um we all know what she went through amen people call and kind of um you know sister we are praying for you and we believe um God will heal you and all this stuff and they talk they talk in a way as if she was so underprivileged they talk in a way as if that God has not done anything for her and she's she's been miserable and she's doing all those stuff and then my wife will say you know what sit down let's talk let me tell you what God has done so she will begin to count them you know I went through this God took me out you know I went through that God took me out you know I went through this God took me out you know I am believing the same God that took me out of this took me out of that took me out of this he's going to take me out and today we see the manifestation of that amen amen yes sir so something that we love is what we talk about amen amen so the same the same message he said this secret coming of the Lord sudden secret going of the church amen watch though between the field it'll take one and leave one there'll be two in the bed you know those days just we thank God for the message amen it's just plainly day and night amen there is day here there is night somewhere else as simple as that amen amen I said the other one in the bed sleeping on the other side of the world Amen I'm just trying to skip I said it will be a universal Rapture I said and it will come with the Shout with the voice of the Archangel and the Trump of God shall sound [Applause] and amen there is an and there and the dead in Christ shall rise and she will be CAU away secretly that's right amen so what what what I I was just um trying to bring out here is that the Lord descended with a shout with a voice and with a trump what was the main reason behind God descending amen God didn't descend just to come and show himself so we can look at him and say oh this is Beautiful Jesus oh you know no there is an A and D to it amen so when God condescended Amen he's trying to pick you up to get to his position amen so the shout the voice and the trumpet bringing God down means that you and I are also going up that is why he said we can't manufacture that we just bear it it is a part of us because it has descended for us to ascend it said and the dead in Christ shall rise and she be cut away secretly said oh I love that the great bridegroom coming and the bride God herself ready I love this ready because he descended the bride is ready it is not us going to do anything amen amen it is the hallelujah amen amen we are working this out amen it is not us going to do anything it is he who has descended and there's an and D to read amen now I I I just looked at something in Psalm 47 amen if we can go to Psalm Psalm 47 Psalm 47 some 47:5 amen yes sir now he said God is gone up yes sir with a shout the Lord with the sound of a trumpet that's right now here is not talking about coming down he's talking about going up so wherever there's a shout there is a trumpet there is a voice and we see a coming down there's also a growing up so he said God so it is not you that is going up it is God that is going up that's why I say ye are God Amen it is us that is going up amen so the shout the trumpet The Voice have already sounded and we are going up we are not going to do anything about it amen amen amen amen and amen amen amen yes sir amen it's ready amen amen amen and amen amen yes sir amen all is well all is well all is well amen and amen amen amen yes sir amen amen amen so um so we go to the next slide it said um uh I I hope I'm I'm time man yeah said this a personal experience with God he said we left off the real principle the real thing that God told us to receive was let the Holy Spirit lead the church that's it that's it amen so it is the holy spirit that is doing this thing it is the holy spirit that is leading the church when the word of God is sent forth the brother brah said that God is watching in over his word amen so it is the holy spirit that is leading the church I said we've left that off we've lost our divine Joy it said we said the vision is D now we've lost the Divine joy and when you look at rejoicing it talks about great joy amen so but brah is saying that because we left our divine Joy the vision is D people are now not looking at the vision very bright the vision about what has been said the vision about you speaking the vision about you sending out the the word of God you lost that Divine Joy it is that Divine joy that is going to make you see that vision amen amen okay yes sir okay so as you said people are not looking at U for the coming of the Lord and yet atomic bombs hanging in and Hangers everywhere and things that will destroy the world at once amen we are seeing a lot of things going on right now a lot of fires amen but people has lost their vision of the Lord because they have set times we lost the vision of the word that we spoke because we set times to this we set time to the healing we set time to the prosperity we set time to God's leadership we set time to Deliverance because of that our vision is dark it is not bright because we have said it must happen at this time it must happen at that time we started the year and we have our own plans Lord this must happen this time Lord this must happen that time Lord I must get this job at this time Lord this business at that time amen and when it didn't happen that way it looks as if our eyes get very blurry amen we lost the vision because we have set time that's right amen amen I said they've done all these things trying to do it within themselves amen we are trying to do everything within ourselves because we spoke we we ourselves now are watching over the word because we spoke the word we have now become the people watching over the word but remember God gave us that bread that were to speak amen so it say he is the one watching over it so he sets the time for it amen he set the time for it it is not us amen amen so because of that our vision become so D amen amen now I I I just love this paragraph that is getting us into something said and now Moses talking about Moses he said Moses had been bit failure but out there now we see his attention attracted to a burning bush amen we know about the story of Moses the men and he looks to the burning bush to find out what the trouble was and walking close to it amen fire B said fire usually brings an attraction we talking about an attraction amen one of the attractions is fire fire usually brings an attraction now you see the whole world is looking at one state amen the state is on fire and all attention is going there amen amen I'm just reading what the prophet said amen usually the holy spirit amen amen I think I lost if I can read from here amen it said usually usually the Holy Spirit when he comes in a manner of fire attracts the attention of people and when Moses turned aside to consider this Burning Tree that will not burn God spoke to him a fresh Vision By An Angel so we are talking about fire of Attraction amen I said that's what it needs today is a church on fire to [Music] attract amen a church on fire to attract amen fire attracts a church must be on fire to attract on fire of the manifestation of the gifts on fire of of of the manifestation of the blessings on fire of the manifestation of the word amen The Church Must Be On Fire to attract yes sir Amen to attract some of these Moses around here somewhere said to attract some of these Sinners amen it takes fire to give an attraction amen yes sir so BR said you let a scream fire amen and everybody's going there amen yes sir everybody jump um in their car and try to follow it amen said there is something attractive about a fire what we need tonight is Holy Ghost and Fire that will attract the believer that Sy now now watch something first he said this sinners now he said believer amen so the Sinners get through the fire to clean something about them cuz they have always been Believers so when The Sinner gets attracted to the fire there's a cleansing Amen to show that he is a Believer amen now we are trying to get to something tonight amen amen Lord help me amen amen amen yes sir so we take um 1 Peter 13-7 amen yes we are talking about fires right now amen 1 Peter 13-7 I believe we are all there tonight amen it said blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ amen which according to His abundant Mercy have begotten us on again unto a lively Hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead to an inheritance Incorruptible and undefiled and that faded not away reserved in heaven for you am who are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time I said wherein ye greatly Rejoice I said now it said though now for a season if need be ye are in heaveness through manifold Temptations so said he said for a season amen he said that the trial of your faith being much more precious than of gold th perisheth though it be tried with fire might be found unto praise and honor and Glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ amen so fire is a blessing to the believer amen so trials and temp Temptations is the fire that we go through God is cleaning us through this um trials and Temptation so when we get through this trials and Temptation amen we are moving from one channel to the other now remember we are talking about an attraction amen so this trial and Temptation amen is the fire of attraction to what to the word we spoke we speak a word we need to get it back but then there has to be trials and temptation to receive back the word amen Abraham yes sir amen so we want we want to um talk a little bit about um one story of fire in the Bible Daniel chapter 3 yes sir amen am Daniel chapter 3 I believe we all know the story amen amen the this um four special friends amen who are from the tribe of Judah amen and and they were also priests by Nature yeah yes sir the prophet called them the bride and then their Prophet amen we we're going to come to it amen so it's just it's just typing us amen it's just a perfect type of what is going on in this last age amen cuz you see that let's just read amen now nebukadnezar the king made an image of gold whose height was three cubits and the bread of thereof six cubits he set it up in the plain of dura in the province of Babylon amen the prophet said that this image was an image of a religious person a a righteous man amen and we know that man being Daniel Amen now Nebuchadnezzar has seen the manifestation of God in a man to the point where he just did an image of that man and then brought it to his friends that's right amen now you remember the prophet said that Daniel himself did not worship this image amen so if Daniel didn't worship the image what do you expect his friends to do his friends will never worship that image regardless of whether it was the image of Daniel or not amen so when you bring something amen of the Prophet amen and bring it to the bride today in the form of worship there is no way the bride of Christ will ever take that there is no way the bride of Christ will ever take that amen and when you notice it's a mixture of religion and idol worship amen so he's seen a manifestation of God in a man amen and we know 2,000 years ago there was manifestation of God in in a man amen and that was taken amen and mixed with idol worship and presented to the world yes sir amen yes now I'm going to read this um from verse 12en now uh as we know these three um Hebrew boys amen did not bow to the image amen so now there's a report that is been given to King Nebuchadnezzar he said there are certain Jews whom thou has set over the Affairs of the province of Babylon Shadrach mesach and abido these men oh King have not regarded thee they serve not thy Gods nor worship the golden image which thou Hast set up now when you look at it it said they serve not thy Gods nor worship the golden image so the golden image was connected to the gods of Nebuchadnezzar regardless of how righteous that golden image might look like it was still connected to the gods of Nebuchadnezzar and there's no way the bride in that day will ever take that amen because this people Bible says they they were they were children of wisdom yes sir God had given this people wisdom to to discernment to look at whatever spirit is going on regardless of how it is being presented amen amen yes sir I said then Nebuchadnezzar in his rage and fury commanded to bring Shadrach mesach and Abednego then they brought this men before the King Nebuchadnezzar spake and said unto them is it true shadra Mish anded do not ye serve my gods nor worship the golden image which I have set up amen a combo said now if ye be ready that at what time you hear the sound of the Cornet flute H sock but sulter and doer and all kinds of music amen amen you see the devil also perver the devil always perver how God does his worship amen before God comes to speak before there's worship amen there's the music there's the Levites who come and prepare the ground amen so the devil also takes that and perverts that yes sir amen yes sir amen goad amen amen so now if you be ready that at what time that's 15 you hear the sound of the Cornet flute HCK bed suy and dma and all kinds of music You Fall Down and Worship the image which I have made well but if you worship not ye shall be cast the same hour into the midst of a burning firey furnace and who is that God that shall deliver you out of my hand yes sir now now if you remember Nebuchadnezzar has seen a manifestation of deity in a man because his um his astrologers and his magicians told him that there's nobody right there's no man that can interpret your dream can know what dream you had or interpret except the gods amen so when you see a man coming to do that there's nobody who could do that but God himself so the book ATA saw that and idolized it but you see but now he's challenging amen now we we we get to find out that this is this is like an indirect connection to the god of Daniel not a direct visitation to Nebuchadnezzar amen it was Daniel that came to manifest God but he nebukadnezar didn't see it but when he came to the time of shedrach mesach and Abednego he saw the Son of God himself so it's a personal revelation that we must have of Christ in our end time yes sir amen amen amen sir it's a personal revelation so said who is that it say shedrach mesach and Abed answered and said to the king oh Nebuchadnezzar we are not careful to answer thee in this matter we are not careful in other words we are not cautious we can just speak to you the the the prophet said they were Stern they knew what they were talking about it wasn't a Wishy Wasing something they knew what they were talking about they didn't fear they knew what grounds they were standing amen it said if if it be so 17 Our God now this is what I want us to look at if it be so our God whom we serve is able to Deliver Us From The Burning fiery furnace now they've already spoke that he is able so the word has already been [Applause] sent amen yes sir the word has already been sent amen and then here he said and if he will deliver us and he will sorry and he will Deliver Us of out of thy hand when he's able so he's not just able we are not just saying God is able God is able but God will God shall do it yes sir he they are not just saying that um I know a powerful God who can do this but he's saying he will do it yes sir there is a certainty that he's going to do it so when the word of God come out of our mouth and it is based on the word that God has spoken he will do it not that he can do it and then we live it there but he's going to accomplish it yes sir so now I love this so they sent a positive word that he will do it yes now said but if not so now I just love the word if because if is a condition that's right so they were so positive to the extent that even the negativity was put under a [Applause] condition they were so positive that even a negative thought was put under condition now condition means that it might happen it might not happen so the negativity might happen might not happen so the negativity of a negativity is positive so I am still giving your negativity a positive chance yes sir amen amen yes sir some of us can be so negative that even our positivity is negativity we put up positivity and condition because we are so negative amen I I Pastor I I want to talk about something amen if you can permit me amen amen now I I wanted to read this quote about signs so we clear the U the airwaves amen so um now let's skip this so we as the prophet said I didn't want to go through all this stuff amen amen so let's go to the next slide amen let's go to the next slide okay amen now bra brah said something now Christian friends I want to say this just before amen many times many phenomenal things happen as brother backers explained to you I'm just your brother and just a man but when things are taking place let everyone hold their peace Hallelujah I don't know what will take place I want everyone to be just as Reverend as you can if you are a Critic I wouldn't [Music] said this is Brother Braham saying this he said if you're a Critic I wouldn't set near because remember friend he still call you a friend if this be said if you want to place it that way said the spirit of God and unclean Spirit go out of people so when brother Braham is U doing the miraculous things amen praying for the sick and things he said you are a Critic remember this I said the spirit of God goes out of people and you are a Critic you are subject to it amen and be it assured to you that I'm not responsible for criticism for any unbelief for a demon is just as helpless as he can be so brother Braham is saying that when the demons go out of people he prays for people and the demons get out of them they are helpless they are just looking for a place to go to so when you are a Critic they are coming to you so when God is sending out his his word and is delivering people from um from sicknesses is delivering people from bondage is delivering people from financial trouble and you are a critic that financial trouble is coming to you hey so when the word of God comes be positive we shout Amen to it amen and we cast out that demon amen yes sir I want to read the next slide amen amen I said I've noticed this in my own little humble Min I read it the last time amen that there's many times that I'll say something and do not know why I said it and it don't look right but yet somebody will say something but I'll watch and that thing will come just as perfect around to that as it can amen it can come God will make it happen that is how positive the prophet want us to be that when we are talking Amen Let Us believe that God will make it happen God is a god of positivity am yes sir now I I just want to amen let's go to the next slide I wanted to clear up something amen all right and I said you build homes you can make scientific things and God is the creator of science amen I said how are you going to stop him there's a lot of scientific um inventions going on right now amen and we know yes the devil operates by um all these means and things but the thing is that who created all these phenomenons amen who created this universe who created the word the prophet is saying God is the creator of signs amen am I'm trying to clear that out cuz I'm trying to um explain something here now when you take a human body amen a a human being amen or any organism amen sorry I'm trying to uh steal some concept of biology amen yes sir take a human organism amen you break it into sections where we call organ systems amen now when you take an organ system you break it down you fether break it down you have what you call organs right now when you take an organ you break it down you have tissues now when you get tissue you break it down we we have cells amen now even in the cells we have organel amen yes sir and even those organal amen we have little pieces amen the basic pieces that come together as we call an atom amen amen now in an atom right we have three um three fellows amen that are working together one is positively charged one is negatively charged and one is neutral yes sir so every atom amen has got that now there are some atoms let's say uh this is atom P amen I just use the word p and atom n amen now this aom amen have got positive negative and neutral positive negative and neutral amen but for some strange reason this one called P easily loses the negative charges so when it loses a negative charge this one has um the character of gaining negative charges so when this loses a negative charge this one gains the negative charge so this one becomes positive and this becomes negative amen but remember they both had positive and negative charges but this naturally amen by nature always loses the negativity and then it becomes positive Always by Nature it loses the negative amen and this always by Nature gains the [Applause] negative amen but the thing is that even in this negativity is got positive inside but it keeps gaining negative charges so this can get to a point where it keeps losing negative losing negative losing negative and this keep gaining negativity until it sees itself negative so negative so negative so negative but it doesn't realize that it has positivity inside [Applause] [Music] amen it didn't realize that it has positivity inside amen now there is one thing about this Mr P here because he has the ability to lose negative charges it gets to a point where it is able to attract that's right so it is not just losing the negative charges for no reason by gain that power to attract that ability to attract so when it is speaking the word it has the mindset that the word is going to come back now when it's going to come back do you know what he going to do is going to pick up this whole thing here so uh one example is what we call sodium there's um sodium and we have chlorine where we have our salt in it so so this yeah Mr P which is going to end becomes positive and then this negative now it is pulling this to itself amen what I'm trying to say is that when we speak up the word and it goes out we become so positive that when the word is coming back it is not coming back void it is not coming back empty it is speaking up amen it is going to pick up whatever we are intending Amen to receive amen amen yes sir amen amen am thank you Lord my God glory Lord help us amen amen and amen amen yes sir amen so I I just um want to conclude with this amen God has given us Promises of healing of blessings of the Rapture of transformation of Christ in his fullness amen so it takes the attraction of rejoicing it takes the attraction of the fire we go through in our various lives Amen to bring these things to us amen it takes the attraction of praising of confessing these things that he has said to us amen now I want to read this quotes Amen in the message who is God Amen yes sir who is God it said now the believer today most people say he's a good man he pays Tidings to the church he's a good member that's very fine that's a moral life amen amen that's a moral life to pay a tight to live a good life is moral amen amen I said now no one could speak evil of that but that's not what I'm talking about Jesus judged a man a Believer a different type of a character he said Jesus the last words that he said when he left the world go ye into all the world and preach the gospel to Every Creature amen is that right it say he that believeth is baptized shall be saved he that believeth not shall be damned is that right now the prophet said now every church will come that far but what about the rest of it amen every church will come to that level baptized and be saved but what about the rest of it I said he said these signs shall follow them that believe do you believe it it said this signs shall follow them that believe in my name shall they cast out Devils speak with new tongues take up serpent or drink deadly things shall not harm them now Christ gave a promise when he was leaving so he sent his word amen that in my name amen we shall cast out Devils we shall take deadly things and it shall not harm us we shall take the um the serpent it shall it shall not harm us he's giving us all these promises amen it is not just about baptized and being saved that's the end of the story amen there are so many things that Christ has promise the believer amen and it takes us to believe it to have faith in it to keep talking about it to keep loving it amen and being positive about this that will make it accomplish in our lives we just bless the name of the Lord amen thank you very much amen am so invite our pastor tonight amen amen to take over the pulpit [Applause] amen amen praise God let's give the Lord a big clap offering again praise God should we call this part one because you have not finished yet there is more to sending and receiving than what we went through but I'm not going to say it you will continue it amen Oh Glory Glory Glory Glory to God amen amen we want to be those iron that loses negativity amen by Nature I lose negativity by Nature negativity goes away from me by Nature I lose negativity and I'm always charge positive amen fully charg positive Oh Glory to God amen amen love it talk about it amen stay focused on it and God will bring it to pass amen do not put a timer on it God knows what is the right time for you to receive it and when times come that's right there is nothing no even hir not even a devil will stop you from receiving what God intended you to receive amen Oh Glory Glory Glory he mentioned something and I saw people questioning like pzle L be when he says that Nebuchadnezzar saw God in the man and then later on when he was talking about uh himself saying what the brother was trying to express is first God God manifested himself through the discernment right through the son of man ministry as a discernment Nazar saw it he confessed it but he never really caught the revelation of that God that's right if he would have CAU that Revelation amen he would not have challenged that God but because he didn't get the Revelation that's the reason why he challenged that God but now the second time he saw that God now it was no more God in a man but it was a personal revelation of Nebuchadnezzar saying wait a minute I throw three men over there who is that fourth one over there now Nebuchadnezzar saw the god of Daniel visibly in front of him now it becomes a personal revelation amen so this message must be a personal revelation to you when you see that God of the message then no one will take that Vision away from you amen amen so remember you need to send something and when he goes away don't put a Time on it but expect it to come it will happen when in God's Own time but what do you have to do keep loving it keep talking about it amen stop self beeding yourself brother BR I'm talking about self beeding amen sometime it's appearing like it's an encouragement but really we are just condoning or or just playing around with that spirit that is around versus bringing a word of faith that will strengthen and encourage somebody amen wonderful brother said God richly bless you let's stand tonight let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we are approaching you humbly tonight father we thank you for your grace for your love and
