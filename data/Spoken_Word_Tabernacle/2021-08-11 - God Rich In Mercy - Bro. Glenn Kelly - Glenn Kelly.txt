i said this little light of mine i'm gonna let shine but we also know that this message that was given in this last day is one and the same with this bible because he taught this bible so we can say the same about the message this message we're going to let it shine we're going to let it shine we're not going to hide it in a busher we're not going to be scared of it ashamed of it we're going to let it shine because we know it's the truth we know it's the same as this word right here amen thank you lord does anybody have a testimony this evening they like to give sister okay um so this morning i got into a car accident but um i'm fine i just wanted to thank god for that but i also wanted to put a prayer request for the other person in the car they told me that they were doing fine but i just wanted to put it out there just in case they needed something [Applause] [Music] i tell you i may get in trouble for saying this but um i've been in a couple car accidents myself and i know how stressful they can be and was that today you said and look where she's at she's in church after a car accident you know you got to deal with insurance you got to deal with the officers and sometimes the other party goes to the hospital or you know whatever it may be it's not something you're going to just drive straight to church after but i see her here this evening so praise the lord for that anybody else have a testimony on their heart this evening for the night oh well some might give a testimony of thanking god for keeping us safe on the roads as we're on the um every day but yesterday morning i am i woke up and you know you can sense your body not working the way it's supposed to and um i decided to say let me just check my pressure check my pressure was like 177 over 114 and i just want to give god thanks that i'm here to give this testimony today and i just ask you to keep on praying for us thank you [Applause] amen i just got a small testimony thank the lord but um i was talking to an elderly sister i've known in um maryland today and just checking on him hadn't talked to him a couple years and so she said how's brother sam and sister teresa going and i said they're fine and then i looked in the parking lot and there he is [Applause] i want to thank the lord for all of his goodness he has brought me through so many things and he is just continually blessing us so i just really want to thank the lord for that [Applause] we'll pass it around we've got time for testimonies right i just want to thank the lord tonight for a specific breakthrough for a long time i had a barrier of not being able to read the message listen to the message and pray almost almost two years and by his grace and by his sovereign mercy that's been broken i am reading the message listening to the message and wanting to that's the part that that's the part that i'm excited about and just the last part i'm believing that will happen really soon is just getting on my knees and praying and giving him the preeminence in my life continuously so i just want to thank the lord for that [Applause] so it's a testimony and a prayer request i would say maybe about a month a month and a half ago my husband was offered a promotion innocence and it was to send him to kentucky to do work and as a wife we're like okay you know stepped out on faith god took me out of the work field so we're down to one income that sounds great then lo and behold the lord puts on our pastor's heart to give that sermon nothing comes before christ so we trusted in god again and the position presented itself and it was like okay well we'll send you to kentucky for just a week and he said no babe i'm gonna ask that we have you know i can get off work at a certain time on wednesdays to make it to church because that was a burden on his heart and the lord answered that prayer he's here um and we're just asking that y'all continue to pray with us that kentucky goes well for that week he comes back home no issues and he can continue to get wednesdays off for church [Applause] amen we also had a prayer request as well brother hamilton handed this to me before service but grandfather's health is declining wanted to pray for his healing also to keep the family in prayer they they're traveling out to see him they're leaving friday and returning saturday night or sunday morning so we'll keep we'll keep them in prayer and may god give them traveling mercies on the road and bring them back home safely does anybody have an unspoken request on their heart this evening amen and we'll get brother sam to come pray for us this evening our heavenly father we're so grateful lord jesus that you're an ever-present hope in a time of trouble lord you promised lord jesus that you'd heal all our diseases lord you said our sin our iniquity you would remember remember no more but father we don't want to take your grace of god in vain lord jesus we want to appreciate it lord we want to love you for it lord and lord it's a small thing to me for perfect love to want to be loved perfectly and so lord jesus if we have a request before you this evening lord we all want to love you perfectly with all our heart with all our mind and with all our soul and lord for the needs that was was spoken father lord before the need was was there there was already a remedy lord jesus and father we're so grateful lord that you made that remedy before satan could ever make a problem you already had the cross prepared lord you slew the lamb before the foundation of the world lord jesus satan never gets a step up on you lord and that's one thing as a child of god that i've come to realize lord that everything is working together for my good and lord jesus all the stress all the worry if it's happening it's happening for my good and lord jesus there's a lot of things that we don't ask for but they come our way but we're not going to murmur we're not going to complain because lord jesus the children of israel was given for an example unto us and now we can read back in the book of exodus and numbers and we can see where they made their pitfalls lord and lord jesus we're able to avoid them with your guidance and i'm so grateful that you're you're a caring father that whatever we ask for lord jesus you'll give it to us and so if we have a lack of a prayer life if we just told you lord we're lacking in our prayer life lord you'll help us to increase our prayer life if we're lacking attending our our bible readings lord and we come to you and say lord i don't think i'm paying enough attention to my bible please increase my hunger lord you'll do that for us you love us jesus you didn't come to condemn the world but you came that the world might have life and have it more abundantly and now we're sitting at your table tonight lord jesus with only one purpose in mind and that's lord god that we can hear your word that our faith can be in strengthened lord god that it will endure to the end because you said they that endure to the end the same would be saved so bless the speakers bless the hearers bless the rest of our worship the special singing and may it all be done to the honor and glory of our lord and savior jesus christ amen y'all may be seated as they come gather i think we might have time for for one special someone has something on their heart this

remember you are a vessel of mercy regardless where are you going to be god will drop down pass everything break every law all the way even in hell he would drop there and pick you up because you have predestinated to be saved he put a love of the truth in you you can't help it sister zadie it's gonna bust you're just gonna love the truth amen because you were born to be connected with him hallelujah jehovah elohim hallelujah do you know what elohim means the one that existed by by himself he didn't want to stay like that remember on sunday he failed all time all space and eternity and he had to shrink himself because he wanted to express himself hallelujah before i came to church the lord reminded me that i forgot omniscient and omnipresent so lord's willing on sunday we will see when god shrank how deep god became omniscient how does he know everything and how does god become omnipresent it's not the way we thought before amen there is a key to that that being the fear of time space and eternity when he shrank he opened up certain attributes it is so beautiful amen you ready for it you know where we're gonna meet right you know where we're gonna meet right [Laughter] you know where we're gonna meet right [Applause] it's a special code so you already know amen you know where we're going to meet it is confirmed i wanted to give a praise report but youtube youtube

tell you just an honor i don't [Music] know why brother steve want this old spear tire here to keep coming up here but uh brother sam we've known you was here with the pass through the baton huh amen but while you're standing we won't keep you standing let's turn uh psalms 119 and verse uh 40. and we have i'm sorry 41. don't you keep my mother there in prayer also they um got a text they had run over to the hospital before we uh came in here but we trust in that all is well we don't plan to keep you uh long um on tonight by the grace of god but we want him to have his way psalms 119 and verse 41 he says let thy mercies come also unto me o lord even thy salvation according to thy word and let's go to um ephesians and then you could be seated after this chapter 2 and let's look at the verse 4 5 and 6. once you have it say amen he says but god who is rich in mercy for his great love wherewith he loves us even when we were dead in sins have quickened us together with christ by grace you are saved and have raised us up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in christ jesus may the lord add a blessing to the reading of his word you may be seated and just a little simple thought you're familiar with god's rich in mercy god's rich in mercy i tell you i just couldn't get away from it i was pressing and laboring it's been it's been a fight but uh we thank the lord for your prayers tonight and in your pools so you know how it is by the grace of god when you're looking but it couldn't get away from mercy you know when you look at what the lord has brought us sunday morning i tell you it was just richly a blessing you know we got some a lot of reading here but we got our timer up here also we understand this wednesday night so uh we just want to lay a foundation and um we want to we're going to kind of really want to work out of um luke 15 but we're going to lay a foundation here on tonight maybe some of you can see and can help you while you're not getting the mercies of god that you should be getting from god you know we know it's ours we know we've been predestinated we know that it can't be taken away from us because god had us we're at in the back of his mind before the foundation of the world is that right so if god had us in the back of his mind before the foundation of the world we were all attributes and you were attributes you were in the mind of god that's the reason why you don't know a whole lot about god right now really let us get there you'll see because you were just a thought at the time i'll take my time god help me he says now look he says now moses he says and now then we find out that we have come to another ephesus it says now the episodes where that we are in our intellectual not an intellectual denomination and forth our education programs has come in it says then we must and ephesians again we must have in ephesians again ephesians is parallel to joshua is that right within jehovah's savior so we know that it has to be a coming out and going in is that right so it has to be that coming out as they came out of egypt and it was going in is that right into the land and to the promised land but of course we know that that wasn't a stop because abraham was what the seed of abraham was looking for a city and a builder in the maker that was of god is that right so we know that god is moving in his hour here now because his mercy and his grace you know you can preach on this until he come i mean because there's so many angles on this but we want to bring it up to how a prophet of god was working with it and how we have to realize in this hour here now that's why you get the word and that's why you get the prophet the words of the prophet which the word that the prophet comes out of the scriptures because he said in this area in his time now if those two spirits is going to be so close it's going to deceive the very elect if it was possible is that right so it's just like the holy spirit is telling what's ministering to us about the second death you're going to have people that can meant to talk about the second death right here in this message and they could talk about the second death but god has shared us is her natural in that natural death is still two deaths is that right it's the deaths of the flesh which of the body and there's the death of the spirit which of the spirit and the soul is that right he says to them but when you die of that flesh we know that it's corruption that sets in in that flesh is that right but down in your soul is two depths there you can doubt one you'll go further from god when you die in the spirit is that right and your soul can be totally annihilated if you're not from god and then there's the other part it goes because it tells we die what we died daily is that right so we want to go come further from god and one has drawn us closer to god so we have to understand now you're moving into the mind of god that's what the holy spirit is moving us into we're getting ready to get out of here it's not much longer saints and we're going to read some things that help you along by the grace of god we know that god is rich in mercy ever since the foundation of the world is that right before the foundation of the world because now which he showed us that he was a what a big circle is that right and then that big circle was there and it was just void it was just god those seven rainbow colors is that right so that's the way god is god is is eternal we know that he was elohim he was self-existing all by himself is that right and then just bear with me because we're laying a foundation but then when that in the garden when then he formed men from the garden is that right when he formed man from that guard let me back up a little bit because the holy spirit hid it brother stevie that was a confirmation when you said mercy i didn't know which way he was going you know his time they got around in it sometimes brother freddie you just gotta move by faith god don't deal with you the same way all the time he just wants you to move and trust him is that right trust in the lord in all thy ways and lean not to that own understanding is that right so we know it's by the grace and the mercies of god and so we know when god shrunk down is that right he came down to that what logos is that right and when he said that local said he spoke he said let there be what light and there was light is that right so god you have to understand we are moving into a supernatural god you are moving into your position that god have called you for before the foundation of the world we are having a revival over the word because it's an opening of the word and the bride is a word bride she loves the word she can't wait to come into the presence of the lord is that right help us tonight lord we need your help hallelujah so he says look he says i want to take from here and this is our topic the god that's rich in mercy he says i want to you to notice here the apostle paul he made mention of this he he quickened who were once dead now this is god rich in mercy if you're taking your notes like i said i don't have powerpoint so you're taking your notes it's 1 1965 in the sixth chapter he says he says we were what dead ins in sin and trespasses walking after the things of the world the desire of the flesh and fulfilling the desire of the mind in the spirit so see you have to understand we're going to get ready to move into something it's not just brother steve he's a lot of times he makes statements but if you study the message and digging the message it's quotes that's coming from the prophet that ties right in with the scriptures so we're moving into a supernatural act now is that right nothing is going to be able to stand and stand in front of you we are seen to be victorious to live a victorious life god is granting us is that right um brother abel you got a testimony is that right well that thought that wasn't yours but it was yours why because you had a desire in your heart but it's for the glory of god is that right everything we do we have to do it for the glory of god so you children you have to understand that's where they get themselves in trouble right get take it on the cardinal mind fellowshipping with devils and demons out there in this world today okay so we're moving into something so now you have to realize these religious demons they're going to be able to take this bible the same bible that we got is that right but they're not going to have what the revelation because the anointing comes from god god back it the anointing is what breaks the yokes upon the people you have to come in expectation god is richly blessing you look how many children that god has brought to you come to hear from your father tonight he's pleased with that and what you come expecting he's going to grant it to you is that right it's time to get right with god it's time to get in your position we're going to read some things to show you why you're not getting the full mercy of god you can't fool god i can't fool god none of us can't fool god is that right hallelujah help us lord thank you jesus he said now look he said what caused this change and what caused it from one time being dead too quick and quick it means you made a lie that's right brother you are made alive god the only one can do that he says now look there was a change from death unto life there is no other thing that can happen to any person listen to this and don't let it go over your head he says it says now this there there is no other thing that could happen to any person so great as to change him from death to life huh look at that mercies of god that he has put in the hands and the lips of his children is that right for god so loved the world he gave his only what begotten son is that right at the cross at the cross where we first saw the light and the burdens of our heart rode away but it was there by what faith that i received my sight see the atonement it was a big jesus came so they may have life everyone could have life and have life more abundantly but the atonement was really only for the elect that's all it was really for because the plan of redemption is to buy back somebody that was already there is that right so that's why the holy spirit told us sunday morning you could only be born again to be born again you was already with him before the foundation of the world he's bringing us back to where we once was [Applause] look what he says it's your mercy he says now he says a man if he was dying physically and could be healed physically that would be a great thing but nothing so great as when he is spiritually dead and god has quickened him to life god's only one can do that because he knows that's why the last time when we was here we was telling you about those attributes of that body that seed with the holy spirit when the pastor was ministering about that seed in that tree you remember when we got in that seed in that tree where before that tree could be a big tree it had to be a what a seed there is that right a fertile seed a seed that have to have life in it is that right and the only seed that had life in it is a faith seed that faith seed that god put there god put it there but guys see the devil thought he had us in our july in our life drinking smoking drugging stealing lying okay robbing but god rich in mercy put a faith seed there before the foundation of the world he hid us he was not only hit us in his mind when he hit us in his mind he hid the fake seat down there before the foundation of the world look what he says he says now he says and dead and god has quickened him to life you know you once in the past time you were dead even men here tonight we can look back but when we were dead listen what the prophet said you deserved that way because you was a sinner he says that help me lord he said but god who is rich in mercy that's the thing god who was rich all these things that we were but god made the change right there god who is rich in mercy that's why paul told them over there in romans 12 he said i beseech brother by what by the mercies of god now he was telling them never forget the mercies of god because they were blind then the holy spirit had to pass the menace to us months ago and showed us you know you were raised up you know the jews where they were chosen people you had that time to live by the law but to show no man could keep the law but they were still heathens just like the gentiles so paul was trying to show them it wasn't the law that was going to save you you ought to remember the mercies of god because jesus came in the redeemer and fulfilled the law is that right the law was just a school master there's always difference to keep us but he came to fulfill the law i mean fulfilled the law by what mercy and grace is that right so paul constantly reminded them what he did for him he justified them he's sanctified he's filling with the holy ghost but look he talked paul talked about the adoption but he brought a win in our time is that right we won't get ahead of ourselves we get over there to luke 15. that's what i basically want to work with we're just laying the foundation he said now look he says i'm so glad for that he said that he being rich in mercy see we thank god for the finances we thank god for our homes we thank god for our transportation we thank god for these things we thank god for our education but imagine if that's all he was reaching huh but god is rich in mercy is that right abel made a way he became the atonement shed his blood for you and i you are more valuable you are the value of the blood the valuable of the blood god thought so much of you he came down is that right he came down that's why it is that we're here now all the fussing it's the sign of the time if people are fussing about this and fussing about that the prophet of god already told us that's the sign of the time is that right so we're going to show you god spoke more of his second coming than any other thing is that right because he knows that he living he loved me dying he saved me buried he carried my sins far away and rising the assurance that it's a life after this life the pastor just wasn't talking when you're talking about you can be there now in your mind and you could be over a place over there you see something and then you could be back there and then you could be over there i'm telling you saints when god unfold the word now is the time to move in it you can move in it god say prove me is that right god rich in mercy see this lay of the seer generation i don't know why you want to be part of the lao to see a generation out there they're blind miserable wretched naked say and say they rich of goods and don't what and don't need god look at that spirit of this age but god rich in mercy he's keeping us from it is that right he's watching over us he's the prosperous he's whatever we do and word indeed do it in the name of the lord acknowledge the lord in everything you do he will lead he will guide he will direct your path so now we can say what that's why the last time i was here by the grace of god pastor i was there was just just a different anointing because now i know why there is a revelation oh death ah where's thy thing ah grave ah where's thy victory glory be to god i'm not leaving here until god says time for me to leave here i'm not going anywhere until my work is finished here that took me to another level thank you jesus you can go boldly to the throne of god with mercy and grace look what he says the boldness he says i'm so glad for that being the rich he said he's just rich in materials which he is but yet greatest thing is being rich in mercy or what a great word that is how that we were once dead and we were speaking other we knew let me drop down had to jump a little bit because i'm keeping up with my time he said now look he says we might i might inject just to tell them a little doctrine here if you don't believe it all right that's okay i i believe it he says when he is born in this world he says when that little baby born in the world you could not have been here without being what for knowledge of god being predestinated these things see god is shortening the days for who the elect fake is that right who can bring any charge against god's elect no one for his god that justified you for his god that sanctified you for his god that filled you with the holy ghost for you are his workmanship he is the pride we are the pride we he's the potter and we are the clay is that right it's god molding and shaping us into the image just like he is hallelujah thank you getting a little warm in here hallelujah he said now look he says he says now let me jump a little bit help me lord he says says we always and the reason we were because we are a part of god you is always eternal you got to start thinking like god [Music] then you can move into your position he will show you you understand it's a wisdom with everything this is the age this is the time let me keep going he said now look he said now we are a part of god you always was you don't remember it because you were only attributes he was saying that earlier he says you were only in his thinking your very name it was on the book of life boy ain't that beautiful huh all names that was not on the lamb's book of life will worship the beast is that right but our name was written on the lambs of light by his blood by the blood of god god came down and redeemed us back himself somebody failed to send me a text about who is jesus i said jesus wasn't black jesus wasn't white jesus wasn't jew and jesus wasn't gentile jesus was god men are fleshed it in the flesh he was the son of god and he was god he said who do men say that i am he says there are some say you're elijah some say you jeremiah some say you john the baptist some say you william branham but who do the elect of spoken word say that he is thou art the christ the son of the living god upon this rock flesh and blood have not revealed this unto you only my father which is in heaven could reveal this to you but upon this rock i'll build my church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it get back satan get your hands off of god's kingdom see when you came out when you came out of egypt see they were the people of god then when they came out right while they were in egypt they were the people of god when they came out they were the church of god that was old testament speaking ah women in the new testament he said when we got in there he where we were what we were the eaglettes we were the child of the kingdom we the messiahs when we came in there so now what did he talk we part of the kingdom of god is that right we're no longer we are sons and daughters of the most high god is that right listen where we going help me lord it's time to start thinking like god see god rich in mercy it was rich in mercy see the prophet of god was just about to leave the scene but god opened this up to him he opened it up to him look how rich of mercy it was this 1965 hallelujah some of you wasn't even born but look how much he loves you god is rich in mercy he saved it for his bride he waited until this time he brought you in this age because you are overcomers is that right you are achieve us and let your motive and objective be god's will and whatever you ask you can receive but let it be according to god's will and you will be successful in it we're not gonna have no time to fool with satan you ain't the time to fuss with no religious demons i am ain't got time for it we're on our way out of his things we're going to reach them you're going to see how close it really is there's no way that's why the past i don't have the quotes but i'll find it for you that's why you hear the pastor keep saying you gotta keep up don't fall behind you gotta keep up because the prophet of god said when they was getting ready to come out of egypt it has to be a coming out and going in but the blood the blood had to be on the doorpost the blood today is the holy ghost and life has to be there so the blood has to be on the doorpost and he was teaching them now you sit there don't forget this time my brothers my sister children he said this is never forget this is going to be the passover this is going to be the time we exiting out of here is that right so the death angel was going to strike but they had to keep up with what moses was teaching them while they were sitting and waiting [Music] that's why the pastor said you got to keep up it's heaviness on his heart when you see him and he said how many of y'all listen to the message see don't be lying don't let no lion spirit get on you you just have to know why because you got a god that's rich in what mercy lord have mercy on me father huh look what he says we know the ministry is sent by the words of the god from a word from the lord let me keep going because i want to get through a lot of this he said now look he said natalie part of you are a part of god you as always he says don't remember it because you are only a attribute in god that's why i said you don't remember it's just in your mind don't worry about it see that's why those 10 spies that went out there those 12 spies went out there is that right brother branham called the other 10 that came back with a negative report what he called him a lion preachers is that right but the next time when he had to go in there over there with rahab what he said leave them lying preachers there i only need two huh bring me a witness somebody that god's working faith that's working by love send me them he said look what he says he said you were only his thinking you were but your very name if it was was on the book of life it was put there before the foundation of the world he knew he knew what you were he says i'm only saying this not to mix up doctrine but to straighten it out you see what i'm saying he ought to straighten it out because when you start talking about foreign or predestination it shakes some of them out there than religious demons you know you know you're going up against those religious demons and they believe that they write by the letter he was saying by the letter but the letter killed him and the spirit give life is that right paul said but i was not disobedient of the heavenly vision that was given unto me paul set up under one of the best teachers in the land is that right hungarian he said abandon but the chameleon come in camellia and i didn't see nowhere with chameleon come in but i see where paul came in is all by election for knowledge and predestinated empowers the pharisees of the pharisees but paul on the road to persecute christians and he was there rich immersing he was blinded is that right when paul was blinded out there and when he got on there he had to go down and got blinding for three days but the scales was on his eyes but god uh a man like paul his name was saul he persecute christians he'll throw you in jail he'll have you stoned the dancer but what he was a chosen vessel to do uh to the gentiles to be a great light god rich and mercy somebody was on drugs but god hid them rich in mercy delivered them somebody was out there stealing god reaching mercy delivered them somebody was a lesbian god rich in mercy delivered them somebody was a drug addict god rich and mercy and delivered them god oh rich in mercy thank you jesus help us lord he said look he says i'm slain but to straighten it out he said that we might get away from this what this fear in being scared when you bring into the knowledge you're a son of the most high god you come from god you're going back to god you don't have to fear anything the last thing is that you what the holy spirit show us you can't even speak depth on yourself david couldn't even speak depth on himself it because why no one had right jesus had everything under his feet except for what death is that right let it sink in a hidden mystery a hidden nugget people say well why are they on the mysteries why they gotta have all the mysteries what are you under mystery for because of what it's going to increase our faith we got to have the mystery before we move into the millennium that's scripture let them keep on live streaming what about a god gonna cut it off whoever out there will see you if god cut it off okay because if they see they'll be there they'll be there because he said no one can come to me unless my father will draw them so if they're his he's going to draw him and we're not going to lose not a one is that right hallelujah pray with me now don't worry about the saints if you got to work tonight or you got to work tomorrow god will give you the strength we're touching the greek god will give you the strength why because god is rich in mercy and what you're doing you're doing it for his will you're doing it for his glory for his praises for his honor for his name [Music] in the name of jesus he said what do you say in the name of jesus in the name of jesus we had the victory the name of jesus in the name of jesus satan you have to flee ah tell me who can stand be for us when we call on that great name who jesus [Applause] he trembles at that name demons trouble at that name they hate to hear that name they don't like that name david tony apostles don't go through what brother charles preaching teaching in the name of what jesus but we got the resurrected jesus in our midst greg that's why that gun couldn't what hit you is that right hallelujah [Applause] all these testimonies the living god the spoken word mixed with faith is that right huh got to have a faith hand hallelujah help me lord he says he says now look he says that you've got to get away from this fear and scare he says you don't know who who you are devil know who you are that's right brother around he ate us he know who you are they come around in there the most demons they knew who the jesus was then they and that man the legion how is the devil can recognize did you recognize the demons and that was in in i mean the holy spirit that was in jesus and you're going to tell me they don't recognize you you got the holy spirit oh yes they do many of them on your job come and ask you to pray for them how many on their job asks you to put their name on the prayer list they know who you are huh they recognize who you are they know it's something different thank you jesus he said now look he says you don't you don't know who you are you're not going going to be but now you are sons of god it says see you always were the sons of god for god when god had you in his thinking at the beginning you were to be part of he was the part of you your life that's in you now had to be with god before there you see beautiful he says many of you can fellowship with that let me drop down by the grace of god he said now and after a while you heard the gospel see maybe you went to church you picked out his this and that and went from denomination to the denomination but one day you being part of god you are part of the word and when you heard the word you know where you come from you know that what was the truth you were always the seed was in you always he says the word when the word that was in you that was before the foundation of the world the word and you coming in together look and see what god is doing and we're now becoming one with god we are partnerships with god is that right so in this hour here now we have to realize that god is so rich in mercy we want you to see once you see your position and what he's put you here for help me lord he said now look i'ma jump a little bit he says let me skip that course we know he's you know you that is born of god that's first john 3 and 8. your dad is born born of god you cannot sin and we know sin is unbelief here that is born of god you cannot sin so you're not doubting the word you're here because there's something inside of you god put in there before the foundation of the world that's why he said you just have to sit back because you're eagles huh the egos you see those little birds out there when you see those little birds flying [Music] they work in the fly they working hard to fly [Music] [Applause] look what he said he said now think of this help me lord we're going to jump a little bit he said now look we know god rich in mercy always from the old testament we know when noah and god noah found grace and mercy in the eye sights of god is that right because god did what predestinate noah to go through it before the foundation of the world is that right but before that he has noah had to keep an eye on who enoch is that right the religious demons they're going to be keeping their eyes on us the sons of the prophet will be keeping their eyes on us when we rapture out of here the sons of god we will be gone so we are watching the spirit that was on elijah is that right the great ego it was the spirit of elijah that had to come five times and the spirit of elijah was the anointing of christ out of malachi 4. luke 17 30 revelations 10 7. is that right so that's why we get our message we get it from god anyone that don't follow this message they're not going to make it hallelujah because we're not going through the tribulation the church goes through the tribulation see but his bride we goes in the rapture is that right going and coming there coming out and going in is that right help me lord i'm trying to go slow he says now look he says help me god rich in mercy he says you can talk to people sometimes on the streets about about the lord they laugh right in your face suppose but they what they supposed to do that had to meet with people fussing about the two spirits i'm saying that's not even a conversation that's not even something to meet on because god said they was going to be here in the last days so if it wasn't then he was a liar but he's not so what we're looking at here now certain things you just don't pay no attention to you're supposed to be mocked you're supposed to be laughed at you're supposed to be talked about but you are what the eagles is that right he said but now look he talked he said there is no man can come to me except my father what that's exactly right brother that's why the holy spirit was saying when the holy spirit was saying sunday humber charles what'd he say he said is because how our parents used to say you can't get blood out of a turnip they can't receive it because they're blinded and then that they're not of god but they're of the devil so that see that's why they caused jesus what bl's about but they could not see him as being the anointed messiah let us sink in we're not talking about the people that's in those systems there's good people and we pray for them because remember the brandon tabernacle they had to get that branham tabernacle bill and it was a catholic brother that helped brother branham and them get that get that building built okay so you got to watch that's why he said you watch them according to the spirit is that right he's learning the man by their spirit because you could be wrong in your doctrine but right in your spirit and you could be right in your spirit but you could be wrong in your doctrine so now that's why we're saying you don't want to be so dogmatic about things is what we're against is the system not the people hallelujah because god is what rich in mercy is that right and that little catholic you know what he better died here as a catholic but he gonna make it in ah i still i i'm still a quote from the pastor's uh um book because why because the prophet of god is the pastor of the age and he can pull a special bullet is that right it's time to recognize what god has given us god in christ is one the prophet is the prophet he's the messenger he's the pastor of the entire age your pastor is the pastor of the local assembly that's why you talk and felt with your pastor if something is on your heart and you need to get with him and you single you need to talk to the pastor because he has a special bullet that can get grace from god that the other officers can't get is that right so the pastor of your household is the head is that right you got you the head of the household is the father he's the pastor of his household that's why people are so confused is because god is doing what restoring is that right what the power worm the conga caterpillar and the locusts have eaten up what all of these religious demons have eaten up so they saying it's too strict it's too hard it's not that it's too strict and it's too hard it's just you have to understand god is rich in mercy but some is just not part of us it's just that this what we're getting is for believers saint is for believe us why because we're rich in mercy if god is rich in mercy we're rich in mercy and you can extrude extend grace to someone you can extend eternal life to someone eternal life to someone when you go to your father we don't go as to our father as as beggars is that right you say what how do we say that's right brother abel we say our father ah which are in heaven ah hallow holy be thy name thy what thy kingdom come thy holy ghost come so that thy what will can be done on earth as it was in you don't go to your father begging you don't have to go to him begging you're a son you're a daughter of the most high god huh huh sister sharon more than a conqueror oh honey she went to a pass she get the double portion is that right she got a pasta pasta oh i lost my watch he didn't watch what's too hard for the pastor ah father huh because he'd be what extended mercy to you and he extended the mercy and the lord allowed him to do what find that watch hallelujah help me lord he said now look he said there is no man can come to me except my father job god has to draw them there has to be a life there there has to be a life in that seat he says in all that he has given me what will come that's right brother saying will come he says why he made a provision for those who wants to be redeemed he made a provision for those who want to be healed and because he that did this makes him what rich in mercy as he was always being rich in mercy it must be if you refuse this there is nothing left but the judgment because sin must be judged you're moving on things that's why he's trying to bring you up and bring you into now so that you can receive the grace and the mercy that's extended from god he said now look he said we know that pharaoh pharaoh came near type of the devil he was an impersonator when it was time for him to come out of egypt and pharaoh pursued them god rich in mercy open that dead sea is that right he stood the walls up he sent the east winds can you imagine almighty god froze froze the ocean stood it up and he froze had it standing inside and the only way for you to go through it got to be by faith ah it got to be by faith so he did he says what they said and then looked pharaoh was behind them is that right we said it's because with the blood it was the atonement is that right pharaoh was behind them he said the walls were standing up the dead sea was in front of them before god paul did he said what why cry speak he said do what stand still and see what salvation of the lord prophet of god said that moses stepped out there by faith brother sam and he stepped down there by faith and he said he parted the sea and when he stepped down he parted the sea he stole this way [Music] he said now stand still and see the salvation of the lord and he went through and they had to walk on through help me lord look what he says now that's the only way he said but god rich in mercy the escape for the hebrew children because they were following look what it was they were following in line with the duty they were following the word you miss your mercy and you're great sometimes because you don't follow the word word you don't do it according to what god tell you to do so that's what that's how they got their deliverance what they need they were following the word of god for their day and the word of god come on eagles wings and their eagles wings is the prophets it had to come on the word of a prophet so that's why we're not lifting up no man but we know by revelation that it had to come by the anointing of elijah in the last days is that right let it sink in god's grace and god's mercy he says now that's the only way to obtain mercy is to follow the instructions that god has given us to follow he said that's the only way he can show mercy is when we follow what he said he said now look hallelujah look what he says here you must follow god's provided way he says can you see what i mean he said now look when they came down when they came through the red sea the same word that drowned pharaoh was the same word that granted deliverance for the hebrew children is that right because they was following the way of the anointed prophet for that day that was the grace that was sent to them for that day so we have to understand in each age god always send them a messenger to show his grace and his mercy to his children let me keep going he says now we are he says now he says that can we see what i mean people who don't believe in divine healing you can't make them believe those that don't believe in the baptism of the holy ghost see god is rich in mercy to those who will follow after him not after creed but after god god is the word and it was made flesh and dwelt among us now and that he might bring forth what other attributes of god hear what we're saying the body jesus was the body of god the body the body now you're the body of god the body of jesus christ now he's moving in the midst of us by the holy spirit is that right that's why the holy spirit say if you don't find if you don't find to follow the word of god for your day so the holy spirit you're still having trouble with the heels huh and god wants you to dance and praise the lord god wants to use your legs god wants you to praise them is that right huh how you going to do it the holy ghost can't go to your feet because you're up on the high heels huh you see what we're saying your god works mission is that right so that's what we're bringing you into if we want you to clap your hands and praise the lord is that right if you won't let him get in your hands and let him use your hands that's why he says they used to sing a song let my feet praise the lord god use my hands i can praise the lord see he wants to use your whole body the body of jesus christ he wants to come down from your mind all the way down to your nails that's why you don't want to paint your nails he wanted to use your nails too the holy ghost taking over the whole body saints look what we're saying he says god made flesh he said now let me jump he says when any believer comes to god he becomes god attribute his word he used to manifest the word that's promised for that day now you see why we get ready to move into something now you see why the joshua ministry had to come in his time because he when he went to a.i see we got joshua knew when a acan went and took those babylonian garments one thing he knew is that god could not lie he always seen god move he's ain't that brother robert he's seen a move that's why where we're at we're moving in sunday because god is rich in mercy the devil fought us all kind of ways but we have to understand god being rich in mercy but they can and when he lost i think it was 16 or 26 in that battle that joshua said wait a minute [Music] wait a minute something's wrong huh he felt he knew god can lie he knew god had promised he said what i got to say to what brother chose the fireboat ministry after is that right ah find out what happened he covered it he was still desiring things in the world he would still design those things that's why god can't use you the way he would love to use you because you caught between two opinions you got to give him a shot hi come out of there get spiritual amnesia huh wake up who you are huh look the devil in the eyes huh had a double one time look at me in my eyes right there eyes like that and i tell you whatever one for me praying he was about six foot three about 250 pounds you can say what you won't do but i'm gonna tell you something when you corner you're like a cat if the holy ghost don't come down knowing and move them huh we all need help we all need his mercy we all need his grace and i'll tell you it wasn't the grace of god that kept him off of me i said lord he knew but when he looked at me he seen no fear in my eyes huh no fear brother rather no fear and he looked down at him move you devil and watch my god to tell you now watch my god drop you across my feet watch my god or knock you on your back he's a war hallelujah wait until the holy ghost get to his wrath o devil o death where is thy stain the grace of god this is no intellectual work we got we got a bull's eye on our back it's not our battle it's the lord huh it's him through my affliction my comfort comes from the word of god is that right you have to understand this god we was in an institution one time and the devil came in there and we got around there brother saying and the fellow was in the institution and he was going to he was bleeding he had to go get surgery but he came to the bible study that time and when it came to the bible study we were all there and we were standing there and i didn't want them to look at me i want them to see jesus and when they come around in there i told the brothers that was in the bible study i said all those that are believers true believers come on up here we're going to pray for them we're going to show you what jesus is going to do is that right that's why we said benjamin you speak the word your mother's heart will increase your mother's heart will get better this is the church of the living god speak the word by faith you are not the healer it's not your choice it's not by power it's not by might but it's by his spirit saying the lord god is a healer [Applause] we got too many testimonies is that right didn't god keep that bullet from hitting you and your sister didn't god do that hallelujah then god keep you from that accident last week brother god is rich in mercy huh [Music] [Applause] he's moving and when he came back to the next bible study he came there and what he was he was healed and when he was healed he went back and testified and when he come back and testified but you know when something like that happened here come the devil i don't get headaches and when they come there the next meet we came to i had a headache my head was like a like a basketball the pressure was there and i said lord i need help and that word came he said though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death i'll fear no evil for thou i walk with you and then the voice spoke again now believe it hallelujah you know that that demon left me went back to where it comes from saints we serve a living god speak the word say speak the word [Applause] look what he says help me lord he says we find that god is so merciful he said now look he says then god he says and when any believer comes to god he becomes god's attribute of his words he is used to manifest the word that's promised for that day he said god is rich in mercy has never left us without a testimony he's never left us without a testimony each and every one of us should have a testimony god said prove me prove me try your faith huh let me keep going hallelujah he said now god always listen i'm still a god rich in mercy i'm in one message the god who is rich in mercy i'm at paragraph 76 now god always liking his prophets to eagles and what is that he said moses was his messenger he says and they were following moses and that that was the eagle's wings you see and they were carried because he was packing what god's message william branham was packing what god's message the elect is that right he was bringing for the elect in his last stage he said look what he did so you have to understand god always send a messenger in every age so we have to understand his grace brother branham talked about i think he's back in token you got to go into in in 61 or 60 i think 11 in 11th month he talked about it in token is that but he talked about god always send a messenger a message with an anointing on every age is that right he said the old testament who are they saying he send the two messengers down to sodom and gomorrah is that right he said but the messenger for our age was still there because it had not came was that right to the gentile age so he hadn't came yet but god had what luther is that right wesley is that right the pentecostal times but he also had billy graham he said billy graham was the type of what grace is that right he said oral robbers was the type of the power the power of the pentecost is that right he said but now he had to sin the anointing of malachi 4 was the anointing of who christ back in his church again back on the scene he never left us without a sign so that's when he came he was discerning the thoughts and the intents of the heart that he was using to william mary and branham to let them know this is the last sign of the age is that right now the only thing we got left is doing what he's unfolding the mysteries with understanding the resurrected christ is now moving us in the closer of going home saints look what he says he says now god always likens probably the eagles he says to them and they were following moses that was packing the message and the people followed that he says they were following god as they as they follow moses with his message of deliverance you hear that let it sink in anybody try to accuse you and say you following a man no no no no no you take it to moses hallelujah he said now look just give me a few more minutes he says god they follow moses with his message of deliverance and the bible said that he that perished not with them who believed not see because god was rich in mercy because they were following his commandments he said god wants us to follow his what his commandments that's what god's wanting us to go he went out on what eagles wings is that right you could go to exodus 19 i don't have time to turn to those scriptures exodus 19 you can go to romans 3 when i first started telling you about the the grace and it runs all the way to chapter 8. you can go read it and see what paul was trying to tell them by the mercies of god i beseech you brother i'm begging i'm pleading with you by the mercies of god always remember the mercies because his mercy no matter how low you get no matter how much the devil try to beat you no matter how where you error because you're going to be tried and tested you are not going to possess the gates of your enemy until after the trial that's when you will be tried and tested is that right but you will come out like gold saints hallelujah look what he says let's go to luke 15. i'll see if i can't cram it in if god give me grace i guess we say y'all say all that by the grace of god he said now look says now let's look at here at verse 3 luke 15 and 3 and he spake he spake this parable unto them saying what man of you having a hundred sheep if you lose one of them do not leave the 99 in the wilderness and go after after that which is lost until he find it and when he had found it he layeth it on his shoulder and do what do what now that's why we said last time the joy of the lord is my wife the whole heaven rejoice over what one center that coming to what repentance is that right because you know you see how powerful it is one soul come to repentance it's all a joy let's go over here now i'm gonna jump a little bit the lost coin from the last coin i'm going to just paraphrase it a little bit so you can understand over there verse some if you're writing it down is luke 15 and verse 8. remember the woman at that time back then when she had a tablet and they had a tablet at that time it's not like they got a wedding band back in that day you got a tablet and they got a paddle around their head you know brother branham typed this with the second coming of the lord and when he came in and he talked about the second coming of the lord you got to go over to galatians and five and type it in there but when they came in in that tablet you know it had a it's self-examining kind it was check-up time she lost that one tablet out of there that coin out of that tablet but she knew if she didn't find that coin in the old testament you would be considered a harlot you could consider a a prostitute is that right and then you know that puts you they could put you away but now we there you have to know that the time is winding up saints we're getting close so we have to realize her husband was about to come home and she had to find that coin and she knew she had to fight so she started doing what house cleaning is that right she had to start house cleaning she had to start examining herself and after he started examining herself she had to make sure that she had to get that coin is that right and once she got that coin in there she did what she rejoiced is that right she went and she praised the lord and she was telling them look what she said she said now he says do it light a candle and sweep the house and seek diligently until she find it am i praying my prayer life all right am i reading my bible you see am i looking for lost souls am i looking for someone to tell them about the goodness of the lord am i telling them about those things and am i testifying brother mickey that my wife is going to be healed am i waiting to come tell her to testify we're looking to the hill where our strength coming from saints it's down time to claim it don't tell me what they can't do they've got my wife she had a thyroid stomach and when they called me in that room back there and then they all know about a thyroid storm she died and the lord brought her back again but when we went there we got back in that room you know they called you in that little room and they caught in that little room the nurse was sitting there and the doctor was sitting there and the doctor told me you know that's your wife she died i looked out and said uh-huh he said do you hear what i said i said i heard what you say you know she said but we brought him we brought her back again i said no the lord brought her back doc but you know what i thank you for the hospital i thank you for the equipment i thank you for you i thank you for the nurse over there but the lord didn't tell me she was going nowhere so you let me know when i can go back there and talk to my wife lord if god can raise her from the dead brother mickey he can get your wife excuse me he can get your wife another heart is that right hallelujah look what he said but now go to galatians 5 real quick let's go to galatians 5. i'm just jumping a little bit when you get home you can look at it he says galatians 5. it's self-examining time it's time for that rapture to take place he said now look the character what god come back what he say he says when he come we shall be just like him we may not appear to be anything but when he come not come back we're going to be just like him what are we saying we're going to have job say what brother robin we bring nothing in his world we take nothing out of this world but job was talking about natural things but what god is coming back we're taking the character of christ back home with us saints look what he's saying this is what the brother branham typed it with he said but the fruit of the spirit is love that's one of the tablets that was one of the things that's in our tablet is that right that's one of the things that's in our character that's one of the things that we have to have is that right but the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace long suffering gentleness goodness faith meekness temperance against such there is right no law so now god is about to come once the holy ghost comes god sent the holy ghost down in this hour so that you can walk right come on up musicians so you can talk right so you can live right so you can pray right so you can love right god send us these things in this age we know in this hour here now god is rich in mercy a prophet where the messenger is sent to you in his age is god that's rich in mercy that's
