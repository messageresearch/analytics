spoken word Tabernacle God weekly bless you amen may God bless the visible and the invisible audience I know there are many following streaming all over the world we appreciate you on board God richly bless you and once again welcome to spoken word Tabernacle how many are up to date with the sermon let me see your hand this is my routine here that's to check and to know where everybody is amen how many are reading their Cod book and the church ages okay okay we still have somebody pressing amen remember this coming Saturday April 8th we have our music session part two we already did part one and we will approach the subject on music again part two and try to wind up completely so you know when you're listening to a contemporary or an old Christian music you know how to gauge it which one to pick and which not to pick even though it says Christian but it doesn't mean that it belongs to God everybody okay so remember Saturday that will be here April 8th uh four o'clock the whole church can participate it's open to the entire church but musicians are required because you need to know what you're doing amen by the whole church you're welcome you can come in and participate it's important so whenever you worship God at home or you're on YouTube surfing for something you know what to get and what not to get amen this is not the time for junk food everybody okay we already got the reveal word of the hour so let's fix on what is the best already what has been Vindicated and proven by God Almighty amen there was a a song this morning that uh it's an old song probably and he was playing and when I listened to it and I caught something there they say three people were put in the grave and one came out and two were still down I say that's not true there is one of the thief of the cross that came out from the girl so you see what I'm saying so when you listen to the song even though it looks good it's an old song established for a long time you gotta gauge it according to the filter and the filter is not my filter it is the word of God it starts from the scripture and it's back up by the message of the hour because the Bible and the message are completely everybody okay glory to God on April 19th which is uh a Wednesday we will have our normal regular Wednesday service but we will only preach for 30 minutes and we stop and go to prayer prayer pray pray pray pray I don't know if it's going to take an hour prayer or an hour 30 minute prayer but we want to build in that life of prayer you do it at home by the April the 19th on Wednesday if you can make sure you're there so we will turn the streaming off after preaching and we go to prayer don't look at me don't listen to my prayer you pray on your own everybody okay you got your problem I got my problem amen but when we are in the house of the Lord and the presence of God is here forget about who's on the right or who's on the left go ahead and pour your heart be like Anna in the temple amen you pray you pray until the Deacon says everything okay you say yes it's okay I have a burden in my heart I need an answer from God everybody okay so that's what we want to do amen Glory Glory Hallelujah that was April April 8th music April 15th we got our question and answer that will be Saturday April 15th question and answer here in church let me start again April 8th music part two April 15 we got a question and answer each Saturday then on Wednesday April 19th we got our prayer we uh exhort for 30 minutes and we pray amen then on April 30th that will be brother Abraham will be here brother abrahamara will be here on April 30th and then he will preach also on the following Wednesday which is May the 3rd I know some of them you can you cannot soak them here but when you go home it will be on YouTube so you can follow up and make sure you online everybody okay amen how many read First Corinthians 15. okay praise God good to see you Brother Sam amen amen glory to God everything will be okay We Gather baby dedication this morning for our new member in spoken word Tabernacle she will she is calm that's my experience that's what I saw calm lovely and she looks staring slowly it's a feminine spirit it's according to the message of the hour if you want a coach you see me I'll give it to you she's a true woman everybody okay and I like it she looks beautiful amen her name is Sister Ariana amen but before I call the parent let me read something I always want the scripture and back it up with the message of the hour then we know we're stable everybody okay because there is a difference between the word of God and the will of God you know that right you know that right you know that right when Noah built the ark that was the word of God and in Noah's time that was the will of God everybody okay but today it is still the word of God but it's not the will of God for us to build the ark of Noah everybody okay everybody okay so the crust that was expressing Noah was The Superficial layer there was another layer under there now today when we get in nowhere we are pulling something else that is the word for this entire everybody okay so Moses can go to Egypt and say hey yeah I need to come out that's the word of God and that was the will of God but today are you living in Egypt you in America it's still the word of God but it's not the will of God if I take you out of America where am I going to take you am I going to use a boat or an airplane but I know how to take you off from America it'll be a different way amen that will be called The Rapture so there is a difference between the word of God and the will of God everybody clear it's coming up pretty good Luke chapter 18 verse 15 the Bible say and they brought unto him also infant babies amen that he would touch them but when his disciples saw it they rebuked them hopefully there is nobody here that have a problem with baby dedication whether you have a problem or not I'm gonna dedicate the baby everybody okay but Jesus called them unto him and say suffer lead the children to come unto me and forbid them not for such of such is the kingdom of who God Brother Brad I'm saying the message token after the opening of the seals you know when a silly the fellows like that he always take me back when I was a little boy and now the old saying is you know they they on your feet now and your heart how later but I don't believe Lord so it won't happen to Sister Ariana everybody okay when you dedicate them to the Lord you give them to the Lord then the Lord take over amen we have a responsibility here and God placed this in your hand he made a preacher out of you I always say about women preachers you know but every mother is a preacher sister Destiny you are a preacher amen here is her congregation to raise these little fellows right while Dad is doing what working is that a problem is that a problem is that a problem so who take care of the children when Dad is doing water working so daddy make sure you're at work can you say amen amen amen everybody okay everybody okay and you have got a responsibility God bless you both you gotta find a little water family yes brother here

beautiful and uh yeah let me spare my wife because when she sees one she want another one [Laughter] everybody okay let's go ahead and pray together Heavenly Father Lord who are we to hold such bundle of love unworthy that we are but father through the blood of Jesus Christ you saw us fit to be able to have such a precious gift coming from Heaven leader Ariana rain Cardella father you give it to this family and not only to the family but to the church Lord and Lord we want to be grateful unto thee to thank you for this and Lord father we are approaching you together and bringing her unto that hand you're the one that gave her father May the angel that you have ordained for her be always around her father Lord Jesus Christ we commit Iran to that hand and we come against every demonic Spirit

May father your presence be always there Lord may your Holy Spirit Lord father Quicken the pre the predestinated seed so that Lord father she can be raised and be a servant of yours father give strength to the mother and Lord father fill the mother and the father with that wisdom oh Lord because we always want to get more of the Lord father bless this family and supplier in every way Lord

and commit her unto their hand may your blood always protect her and protect his family remember the desire of brother evil and sister Cardell father bless the family that came this morning to be Lord father partaker of this service Lord father may you bless them for the sacrifice that they have done they could be in there in in their respective church or many different places Lord father but they took time to come here we don't want to take it for granted father we want to thank you because you have given us not only a spiritual family but a biological family father we thank you for them and we ask you Lord father that the blessing of the Lord be upon them like you did for Joseph in everything in Jesus precious name amen thank you very much God richly bless you thank you I told you she's beautiful and she's quiet did you hear any cry praise be to the name of the Lord so don't put that on my Ariana everybody okay praise be to the name of the Lord let me read something quickly and we go straight to the reading of the word brother Caleb I would need some battery it looks like this is running out quickly this is just the house cleaning Amen brother Branham say Amen children do you know how to obey yourself in the house of God do you know this is the sanctuary of God God is in his holy let everybody keep water it is the place of God where people are coming they are coming meditating trying to find Salvation to the soul trying to find the problems of the people's life try to help someone so the least you can do is to be how and be how so get your drink of water before water everybody okay so before service start Mama make sure the children goes to the restroom make sure they get your the drink and make sure they stay in a sanctuary amen moving back and forth my back and forth that's not a good habit amen if a child is diabetic bring it to me and then let's pray for that child we want him to be here or her to be healed amen so everybody should be healthy amen get your drink of water before church start and no leader wants hairs to have drinks mothers that's got those little fellows if you sit near the water keep them just as water as they should never be a whisper never one whisper we are all but when that Bible is read and that Minister enters the pulpit we should be how waiting on the now please try to do everybody clear so far as we preparing for our service I had a question from what was preached last time and it was about the last portion of the sermon which dealt with the New Jerusalem being the bride and the New Jerusalem being also a city how many struggle with that okay I know you're just shy you know in your heart amen somebody asked me a question and put on a question and answer a box so they say that the house mentioned is not made of mortal clay Etc what about the chair that is the hope so there is he the only houses is uh his only houses not Furnishing or Furnishing or something like that in other words what about the chair that happened over there so if I move on with what I have we can get lost somewhere so I want to make sure we refocus a little bit and everybody is on the same page if you miss it I know somebody miss it if you miss it it's gonna get it if you already get it may the Lord open up so we can establish this and move forward this is already a preparation for Easter usually like I was talking one time to brother Chad we don't have uh a sermon for Mother's Day and things but sometime like this time I felt him moving toward the preparation for Easter so we're already preparing and we are already entering Easter with this sermon but before I can move forward let's go straight quickly into uh Second Corinthians chapter five and let's establish this quickly and then we move to our sermon I wanted to do that on Friday and you told me to do that on Wednesday you might be seated with this I will I'm sorry I appreciate your respect to the word hopefully this won't take too long second Corinthians chapter five because if you don't get this right you will not understand what comes up in the rapture everybody good glory to God if you there you can say Amen second Corinthians chapter 5 the Bible says for we know that if our Earthly house the Bible is calling this a house I want you to understand the terminology now because the question is about when is the New Jerusalem the bride and when is the New Jerusalem City I thought the New Jerusalem is a city how does it turn up to be the bride again that was the question amen so if you miss it just pay attention for we know that if our Earthly house so if you look at the terminology of the Bible the Bible does not call this a body now it's calling this a house everybody okay a house of this Tabernacle will dissolved we have a water building a building of hope God so this building is made by God what kind of material is this building so there is a building that is made by God made by God amen God is a spirit everybody okay a house so when we say building you need to be careful in the scripture what are you talking about it is a building it is a house amen a house not made with water hence let's stop right there why is it not made with hands what does it mean in other words it is not a natural house because the house that are made by hand are made out of stone everybody okay or wood or clay or mortar or precious stone whatever you can do it Paul gave us those detail when he spoke in First Corinthians chapter three you know that right do you know that you know that keep your finger right here let's go to First Corinthians chapter 3. we're gonna go back again to Second Corinthians I'll let the Holy Spirit move on Amen First Corinthians chapter 3 verse 12. if you don't know don't be shy we in a family just say Pastor I don't know Pride will kill you Pride will kill you amen verse 12 you there now if any man built upon this Water Foundation he built with water gold or water silver or water precious stone oh what wood or water hey or water you see different materials everybody okay now so let's go back to first to second Corinthians we okay now so this house is not made with hand in other words when you see this house in heaven amen the material that the house is made out is not the material we use here on our Earth for our construction here we okay now I'm reading the scripture first so you can pick up on brother Branham if you don't know you're going to miss Bradham this house is not made with hand so it's not humanly made it doesn't even have human material on it comma but it's eternal hell in the heavens so this house is in heaven and it's an eternal House show me one house in this earth that is eternal this can perish amen if they bring a dynamite they put it here it's gone but this house is eternal if the house is eternal what kind of material is he made out of amen temporal material it must be Eternal material about who is eternal everybody okay God is the only one who's Eternal and God make a house that is eternal so is that house really A house good question everybody okay is he really a building that house is in heaven everybody okay verse two the Bible say for in this in this house in our body we groan earnestly Desiring to be clothed upon with our house how can you how can you put the clothes a house on you everybody okay everybody okay if I give you a house and you go find the house so you will take the house and say I'm gonna put my house on me and you start walking and people say oh they are they are wearing the house we already what kind of house can you put as a clothing you understand now now it becomes clear we clear now he says we would like to be close upon with our hearts which is for what heaven so that house that is in heaven easy is not this kind of house it is a house that you can put it on you I'm not gonna get into that today it's for Easter everybody okay you need to get the house and put it on you how can you put a house on you remember this is a house everybody okay and Paul is saying you're gonna take a house and put it on you if this is a house and this is a body and that is a house so that must be a body are we okay I have not touched brother Branham at all I'm in the Bible we okay now so now we understand that this house is a body and it's a body that is eternal amen so you have another body that is eternal that is in heaven and you have a body that is temporal that you're living on all we want to do is take the Eternal house the Eternal Body and put it onto this one we okay now with that being established let's let's see now the two the two New Jerusalem John chapter 14. it was needful right John Chapter 14 verse 2 in my father water house we need to stop there first because that name houses a trouble why is it trouble the Bible says in my father's house are many water mentions let's stop there how can you have a house anybody okay and you have mentioned inside the house does it make sense this is a house a mansion also is a house how can you have a house inside the house but not one many houses inside one house it's a trouble so we need to understand what does it mean by the house of the father it's what we okay William Marion Branham he says but in the original it is written like this in my father's Water Kingdom we okay now in the Kingdom you can have houses but not in the house you have houses that's a different thing so in my father's house brother Branham is interpreting that as my father Kingdom amen now we make sense brother Branham continue he says in my father's kingdom is many water policy now we make sense but if you notice the tradition of the Bible was brought down to England in the days of King James when the translator translated it and what he was the kingdom was a water house and the King was a water father it makes sense now and all his delegate his subject in his domain was his water children brother Branham is calling the kingdom a domain Oh Glory to God Amen and so making it so the people of England will understand they translated that way in my father's house is many mentioned that means in my father's kingdom is many water mentioned we clear there brother Branham again in 60 brother say I think King James had that idea they translator when he said in my father's house is many water mentioned a house was a water domain everybody clear so now in my father's Kingdom in my father's domain we okay now we have many mentions we okay now we have many mentions or we have many palaces everybody okay or we have many houses or we have many buildings everybody okay we okay now now let's go back to our scripture now when they say the heaven in my father's Kingdom or in my father domain what we looking at we are looking at our cities here because when somebody get into your house you say you are on my property everybody okay meaning that the state the city divided the the houses amen from here to here is brother Charles property from here to here it's brother Greg's property that's not the way heaven is are you staying awake ah William Marion Branham in the message paradox brother Branham is talking about the prophecy he said if you shall notice it is punctuated and underlined if you notice it's wrote in French spoke in French verb before the water because of this momentum water decision you know that prophecy a huge portion of water Heaven awaited begin to wonder what is a huge portion of Heaven because when we say portion we're looking at the property that belonged to brother Branham we okay now brother Branham said now that is what I wondered when I die will it be then I happen to think Heaven is not prop portion of two different portion to us up there let me read it again Heaven is not portion of to different portion to us up there so Heaven is not divided like the city of Gastonia we okay now everybody okay Heaven is the Water Kingdom that is within us one wait for are we okay Brother Brad I'm saying the heaven they're talking about is a kingdom and that kingdom is within you but there is another one that is waiting everybody okay that's why the horse of brother Branham and the horse of Junior Jackson were on the same breed by Junior Jackson horse was just small because Bobby Brown was riding on the horse and he says that I shall ride this train once more I'm not gonna get into that let's leave it alone everybody okay everybody okay everybody good so Heaven as we're talking is a kingdom but the Bible says the kingdom or the doorman there is many mentioned we still have our idea that oh so Heaven is cut off in portion but I'm saying that's not it it is a kingdom that kingdom is within you but remember what is in you before the foundation of the world the predestinated seed which produce your theophany are we okay are we okay in us we got a seed remember and our seed our theophany was only a reflection of acid everybody okay and brother Branham said that Kingdom you have it in you yes but there is another one waiting for that Kingdom you already have it but there is another one waiting for are we together we okay now we okay let's go now to John 14. let's listen to this the Bible says in my father's house we understand what he means now they are in the present many water mentions if he were not so I would have water Told You So these houses these mentions these palaces this building already existed and Jesus confirmed that those buildings are already there and Jesus said if they were not there I would have told you in other words I'm confirming to you that in heaven we got many mentions everybody okay and when you have a lot of houses in a place amen a lot of houses in one place makes what we call a city that's right everybody okay now everybody okay now so the beginning of this passage Jesus is talking about a city that is already in existence everybody okay it's already existing Jesus said if he was not there I would have told you I'm telling you of something that is already in heaven in heaven in there is a city and that City have many mentioned it have many Palestine you have many houses you have many buildings everybody okay so in this statement there is a city that already is in existence and there is also a city that is not in existence yet everybody okay let me read it again with you In My Father's House are present many water mentions if you were not so I would have water told you it's full stop period now watch the next statement I go to water prepared a water place so that place is not there yet everybody okay so we got two places or two cities there is a city that is already existed that guy mentioned and there is a city to be prepared are we okay so now in John Chapter 14 verse 2 how many cities do we have now a city that existed eager houses and there is a city that God is going to prepare everybody okay Jesus continue he says that if I go and prepare a place for you I will come again and receive you unto water myself that where I am there he may be where also so this place Jesus will prepare it so that him and the bread might live together everybody okay everybody okay so it's a place to be prepared for the king and his Queen have I lost anyone so when we are interpreting John chapter 14 you need to know which portion is brother Branham interpreting let me state it again when you are talking about John chapter 14 right here John chapter 14. make sure you check brother Branham is brother Branham explaining the future city or the future home everybody okay or is brother Branham is planning or translating the existing home everybody good now let's read brother Branham okay we establish the foundation I'm sorry it's important because that city is calling which city talk can this city talk but there is a city that is coming everybody okay there is a Teo funny that is and telling you do what come up how so you are low everybody okay everybody okay can I continue okay William Marion Branham now let's read it together brother Branham say I have never believed that heaven was a place where there is a bunch of water buildings where there is a bunch of water houses up there made with water water it's clear the material didn't say there is no houses in heaven he's talking about the housing that are not made with this kind of material you don't have it in heaven because these materials are subject to the gravity if I put a stone right here I let it go the Earth will pull it down everybody okay that's what brother Branham he said you need to be very careful with brother Branham it's a Ministry of the son of man it is the ministry like the ministry of Jesus Christ so if you don't pay attention because Jesus one time came out from the temple he looked at the temple he said destroy this body I will build it in three days and the people came out with that saved the Lord we have that saved the Lord Jesus said that they saw this Temple he will build it in three days and they accuse him for that if they would have a recorded they would have shown to the court and said Jesus is lying because Jesus says that destroyed this Temple he will build it in three days it is on recording on YouTube but the scripture say that Jesus was not talking about the temple he was talking about his honor so you gotta be very careful everybody good all right brother random say where there is a bunch of houses where up there made with murder dub up with water paper paint under one I have never believed that a water supernatural being brother Branham is talking about the supernatural being so a supernatural being needed Supernatural house you need to understand William Marion brother that's why people leave the message they don't understand you need to have the Holy Ghost that work with brother pranam to make you understand brother Branham [Music] everybody okay he said I don't believe that is Supernatural being would have lived in the water literal house now we make sense watch what brother Branham is interpreting in John chapter 14. watch the portion brother Branham say I believe when Jesus spoke in John 14 in my father house is many water mentioned do you see brother Brown I'm saying I go to prepare a place so which portion is brother Brown I'm interpreting brother Branham is interpreting the houses that are already in existence or the city that is already existing and brother brand name stopped there but brother Branham does not touch I will go to prepare your house you see now be careful how you're reading the prophet push the break go slow 15 miles an hour school zone everybody okay okay brother Brown I'm saying in my father's house is many water he stopped right there in the middle he said he meant this portion not that God to prepare that's a future home he meant a water a body a water dwelling place make sense make sense now for the scripture verified there same thing and I say if this Earthly water be dissolved we have one water already waiting so this first portion of John 13 is talking about houses of theophany everybody okay so what was already existing are your Teo fania day and when you have a manatee orphanies they make many houses or many mansions or many buildings or many palaces and a bunch of theophany a bunch of houses a bunch of palaces a bunch of buildings make the city in other words the bride represented in heaven is a city of theophany [Applause] everybody clear so far let me continue brother Bradham says mortal being is the only one who lives in water habitation made with hand Immortal beings live in water Immortal habitation these habitation are the houses the theophany amen then the place that we go until we return back is not a place of water break you see the material on water and water or water pressure or water it's a place echo of condition that we move out of this Dimension that we live in into another dimension it is a house a water a water dwelling place everybody okay remember brother Branham is only interpreting the first portion everybody clear let me go back again I have to nail this before I move forward in John 14 brother Branham again he says when he says in my father house is many water mentioned did you see brother Branham continuing his Subway why is he stopping there because this is what I'm about to talk not the preparing the preparing is a different city we okay now brother Brandon said speaking to his disciple before going away I can imagine that being of water stones why because these are theophany they are Eternal houses they cannot be made of stone they cannot be made of clay or murder everybody okay stone or brick and Mortal I believe the Tabernacle he was speaking of was another body to water living in my father has his many water Tabernacles destroy this Tabernacle and I shall raise it up in water three days and again if this Earthly Tabernacle be water we have warm water prepared we clear now we're clear now this is why brother Branham make this statement best city he goes ahead and say which is the water you Jerusalem the New Jerusalem I will shall put him there I shall put on him the new water Jerusalem now the bread [Applause] now you understand you understand now how many knows that the church itself is the new one Jerusalem you believe that let's just prove it in Revelation water 21. revelation 21. we okay brother Branham say first two John says and I John saw a water a holy city the water you Jerusalem when we say that the first thing you see is buildings everybody okay but watch again Revelation 21 and you will understand coming down from heaven from God out of water Heaven prepare us a water why are Dawn for water your husband how can a city be prepared as a brother let's continue first man and they came unto me one of the Seven Angels which had the seven valve full of the seven last uh of the seven last plague and talk with me saying come on either I will show you the bride then Lambs what the wife now we want to know who is the wife of the Lamb amen because your house is not a male house who's gonna marry a female house we don't build metal house and then we built a female house and they get married everybody Okay we okay but but the Bible says I will show you Deborah the water so we expect that to be a woman right it is the what the lamb is a man John the Baptist say behold there that was a man so if he has a wife the wife must be water a woman so when they say come see the brother you must hear what so let's see the woman everybody okay the Bible says and he Carry Me Away in the spirit to a great high water mountain and show me the greatest city is Jesus gonna marry a city everybody okay is Jesus gonna marry a building but the bride which is the Lamb's wife is a city why because in John 14 there is two New Jerusalem there is a New Jerusalem made of the blood of Jesus Christ and there is another New Jerusalem which is a city everybody good everybody good the Bible continue he said he showed me a great water City the holy Jerusalem descending Out of Heaven from who God and that City have many water why many mentioned because the Bible says in First Corinthians 12 12 for us the body is one which is the bread and have many members many mentioned and all the members of that one body being how many are what one so also is who Christ everybody okay take a man amen this part here is Christ this part here is the body of Christ it is made of many members but all the members from everybody okay and the Bible says that the body which is the bread of Jesus Christ which is the Lamb's what is a city it's a bunch of building so if the body is a city it's building so the land also must be a building let's go to revelation 21. and then we go to our sermon quick uh uh glory to God Revelation 21 verse 22. if you dare you can say Amen that's a whole sermon preached brother Robert Revelation 21 verse 22 if you dare you can say Amen few people and I saw no Temple they win for the Lord God Almighty and the lamb are the water the Temple of it so the lamb is now a because the bread is a city [Music] this is spiritual everybody okay this has nothing to do with the natural yet I am still on the top here I am right here this is all spiritual and watch again verse 20 23 and the City is had no need of sun neither of the Moon to channel for the glory of God did water lighten it and the lamb is the lights there walk on the temple is a light everybody okay they say the lamb is a temple now the lamb himself that is the temple is a light what kind of Temple is like what kind of house is a light it is the theophany everybody okay who is the theophany he is the great Melchizedek and the bread is also theophanese we okay we are the city of the lamb and he is the temple in the city that's spiritually speaking everybody okay that's why brother Ibraham says this brother say notice Jerusalem the word Jerusalem is from above the Bible say which is the mother of what that's all how can the city be a mother a mother means he have children they didn't say a woman a mother a mother means she already got children so this city got children how can children how can a city be mother and a mother is a woman meaning that there is a father of the city everybody okay everybody okay the Bible said which is the mother of us and Christ is our mother we realize that God is our mother for we are born of who him everybody okay so the New Jerusalem according to John 14 the first person of it is a city of theophany it's a building of human being it is not Material like this but on the second portion of it the Bible says are good to prepare air place this is now a future remember right here brother Branham interpret only the first person watch brother brand I'm now interpreting this second portion William Marion Branham in the future home of the Heavenly water and the Earthly right and in the new Earth there is a new city oh my now listen close don't forget this Jesus said in John water 14 he will go to water prepare did you see brother Brown I'm talking about many mentioned carefully now brother Branham is talking about the city of the broad spiritually speaking now brother Branham is talking about a leader of City we okay now brother Branham says let your heart let not your heart be trouble when he was going away I have a reason to go away you believe in God he said believe also in me they could not see that he was God you believe in God now believe or believe in me and I'm going to prepare a water place for you you in my father has his many mentioned in my father Kingdom his many palsy Christ is there under the water construction of this new water not the one that already existed now listen close don't move don't don't miss this Christ is in heaven when today preparing the new water Jerusalem now which a city across this building everybody okay William Marion Branham Christ has gone and is preparing a place that has been on his construction for many many thousands of water yes preparing a place and if I go and prepare air do you see the portion brother Branham is reading I will come again and receive you that wherever are and there you may be also that's now a leader of Jerusalem that will come down from heaven in my father has how many in my father's economy in my father's plan is many Palestine I shall go to prepare air please do you see where he's going look how long it is 1500 square mile say where is he there he has gone to prepare him he is creator he create off of that how goal now we got the material the streets are water transparent he is Creator he's making a place offer in Revelation 21 because the scripture have a compound meaning everybody okay to give you a last example so it will help whoever was struggling in Revelation 17 verse 1 the Bible say there came one of the Seven Angels remember again which had seven vows the same angel that showed abroad and talk with me saying unto me come here I will show unto thee the Judgment of a greater a is a man or a woman that seed is upon many Waters so if he say a a whole lot we need to see a woman verse 3 so he Carry Me Away in the spirit in the wilderness we clear now amen let's see who that woman is brother Branham say the Bible said sit upon a scarlet color Beast full of the name of blasphemies having seven heads and ten horn we already went through this verse 18 and the woman which you saw is the greatest City any question that city is the Vatican it is a natural City but it's also a church a Catholic church so the bread is also a natural City the New Jerusalem but the bread also is a church because every Church age was a city FSS was a city Samina was a city pergamos was a city that tired was a city so this was a City Philadelphia was a city La audisia was a city but we got what we called the broad Edge there is no City for that one that city is the New Jerusalem and the bread being the New Jerusalem will live in the New Jerusalem so the New Jerusalem and the New Jerusalem were married together in that city where the lamb is there in the city where they cometh know I have a mention over there and free from tools and care I am going where the lamb is there any question any question we clear now let's go to our scripture John 14. job 14. I don't know where I am thank you here my brother I don't know where I am in time I'm good so it feels like we're in eternity are you there glory to God ah I put this to just quiet and help somebody I hope he's going to help someone okay I just put this okay it's a quote brother Branham say now when they cross over go over the other side he says now you have asked ask what you will and he will give it to you a perfect top of the Water Church all right I want he says I want a double portion of your spirit that's Elijah Amen brother Branham said don't be scared to do whatever ask how abundantly you have not because he asked now you ask not because you believe no that's right ask ask how and hold up God will give you up a lot of faith a fellow told me the other day he says he was riding an old water multi fall yet and say one day he happened to get some good faith and God give him a water Buick he said everybody okay and say everybody I got a Buick faith I'm praying for water like Faith all right that is how good that is what why keep on what you believe hold on to it God will do it give it he's got the food Faith so just stay with the father that's all right so let's get a little more water faith everybody okay everybody good let's go to job 14. so after church we will be good wait job Chapter 14 verse 1. if you dare you can say Amen the Bible say a man man that is born of a woman is of a few days short life and it's full of water trouble he comes forth like a flower and it's cut down he flees also as a shadow and continues nothing you might be seated verse 7. for there is a hope of a tree if it be cut down that he will do water spoil again so job is saying here that if you take a tree and you cut it down what we call you kill a tree job said the tree have a hope what is the hope of the tree job say that the tree will come up again in other words The Cutting of the tree is not the end the tree has a power in it to come back up again to life another word the tree has the power of Resurrection am I reading a different scripture let me continue for the tree for there is a hope of a tree verse 7 if it be cut down that it will spread again and that the tender Branch thereof will not cease though they root thereof what's old in the earth and the stock thereof die in the ground yet through the scent of water he will do what but even though everything look dead the tree were bad again and bring forth both like a plant verse 10. you there but man dies and West stuff away yay men give up the ghost and where is he so job is asking a question he said when I observe the tree you cut a tree he comes back up again even if I go and I check the tree and it's dried up to the root only take is a sense and moisture of water that tree will revive again but when I see a man dying I don't see them returning where is what happened to the man let's go to Job chapter 19. glory to God we already in Easter amen Job chapter 19. verse 23. if you dare you can say Amen job say oh that my word were now written why does he want his word to be recorded oh that they were printed in a book why verse 24 that they were graved with an iron pan and lead and led in the rock forever why do you want to keep this what you're trying to say job what is imported on this that you want to keep it in the book you want to grave it in a stone so that every generation will read it what is it verse 25 for I know that my redeemer liveth everybody okay my redeemer is not dead it's important to know if he's dead or if he's alive he makes a difference everybody okay but job say I see him he's a love I know that my redeemer leaders and that he shall stand at the light a day upon the Earth and though after my skin worms destroyed this body this Tabernacle this building this house yet in my flesh I shall see who God if the body is already destroyed job is saying that in that same body that same building that same Tabernacle that same flesh that was destroyed I will see God again in the same body in other words job have the answer to what he was asking he seemed the tree cut down come back to life he looked a man he goes he doesn't come Mark away when job saw he said oh I see something about men amen because I'm a human being even though today you bury me amen not in a different body in the same body that you put me on the grave I will see God in other words now job struck the revelation of the Resurrection everybody okay everybody okay verse 27. whom I shall see for myself I don't want another testimony I want myself to see him amen I don't want you to come and tell me the Rapture happened I am the rapture I will see the Rapture myself it's in their individual affair everybody okay whom I shall see for my and my eyes not your eyes you look at Jesus Christ let me also look at him and my eyes Shall Behold and not water another I don't want you to look at Jesus for me you focus on your problem everybody okay another do my reign be consumed within me so now the answer is come back God man have a hope that if he does he's going to come back again but I hope depend on the Redeemer you must make sure the Redeemer is alive everybody good first Thessalonians somebody's full already if you're full we give you a to-go box you ate too many rolls and you drunk too many strawberry lemonade they told you to wait the food is coming amen amen glory to God first Thessalonians chapter 4 verse 13. but I will not have you to be how ignorant I don't want you to be in dark I don't want you to be with that knowledge why is this understanding important why is Paul saying I want to make sure in this corner I need to Shine the Light why ignorant of what I will not have you to be ignorant Brethren concerning them we shall have that you saw or not even as other which have no water hope so Paul is saying I see you when somebody is dead you cry roll on the floor and everything I don't want you to cry like that you're crying like the unbeliever I want to change your behavior when something like that happen in your family you can sorrow you can cry because there is a separation but you need to cry a different way you need to cry like somebody who has a hope I'm crying only for separation but I have not lost anything [Music] the one I'm crying is not lost everybody okay everybody okay verse 14 for if we believe that Jesus did what died that's good that's good thank you just be free that die and water rose again so because the Redeemer we must make sure he's alive don't tell me only he died ah everybody was dead I want to make sure he came out because if he comes out was him [Applause] not another person mice everybody okay if we believe that Jesus died and did water rose again even so damn which are water sleep in Jesus will God do what bring with him in other words if Jesus never came out no believer can resurrect Lord help me verse 15. for which for this we say to you by the word of the Lord that we which are alive and remain to the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them to which our water they sleep you already know this let me go to 17. then we which are alive and we men shall be how God up together with them in the clouds we already went with the cloud you will see those clouds again later with the horses of brother Branham everybody okay to meet the Lord in there and so and so shall we ever be with the Lord wherefore do what comfort one another with this so if you see somebody crying Paul says tell him stop remember one thing you remember the one who died he rose again it means everybody that died in him must also do water reconfirth my brother Bill because we're going to see that person let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we are approaching you humbly again this morning Father thanking you for your grace your love your mercy and for everything you have been doing for us father I have done what any man can do if you've given him ability to do so now he takes the Holy Spirit to unfold your word may you move me completely out of the way may you come and speak your word to your children father in Jesus precious name amen my subject this morning is the four phases of roof the resurrection of the Dead that's why I say we're in preparation for Easter the resurrection of the Dead amen we are fully now in roof chapter four where roof is dealing with the last king's men because as long as that last Kingsmen have power of a roof everybody okay Boaz and roof cannot be United in the body [Music] in order to open the door for a union in the body because the Union in the world happened after midnight in the threshing floor in order to open the door so that Boaz can marry roof and have a baby but Wars need to make sure that he clear or remove completely the first Redeemer which brother Branham said was the devil completely out of the life of roof everybody okay so as we take our data and transfer them into the Tabernacle we are in the holiest in the holiest where roof now is in preparation for the going everybody okay now last week we established two line we established the Eternal line everybody okay and the temporal line everybody okay and in internal line we found out that we start as a seed it's clear now we start as the word and we have a body that is also Eternal and that body is at your funny we just went through that everybody okay in the temporal line we are bad we are spirit and so everybody clear but we also have a natural body which we call the Corporal or the flesh or the physical body amen and the the song that was sung was that come up a lot of water because you are low here you need to just come up when you come up you're gonna beat somebody everybody okay then we saw that in the Redemption of man that when we are born according to the wings of brother Branham on the east side of us we have a seed this seed here Eternal is placing us amen the seed is buried in our soul amen but when we are born because of the nature of our father brother Branham says and the scripture shows us that like in Genesis chapter one that all of this is filled with Darkness everybody okay so when the gospel come amen we move from this state into a second state where the darkness are completely removed amen and we are now here with our Darkness everybody clear because now the predestinated seed that was here is now quickened everybody clear brother Branham says this in the message certainty then he say every seed we bring forth of its kind if you are a seed of God an attribute we went through this a Son of God then the word of God is sown in you as a seed see and then when you hear the word remember it's the word coming to the word my sheep hear my voice a stranger the world follow you get it then every seed come forth after its own everybody clears so far brother Branham continues again in the message Paradox because we found out that as a member of the Bride this seed here is a female remember that's why I say you keep up with the sermon it's an egg and the word that is coming to remove the darkness because Paul said God who spoke light over there in the beginning have also shunned the light of the Gospel in our heart to remove the darkness and to Quicken the seed and the word that is coming with the light that word is the male part or the sperm everybody okay you cannot unite something that is like it that's homosexual everybody okay everybody okay if we are the bread of Jesus Christ we can only be United with a male everybody okay I don't care how pretty our church get how nice we try to dress have fun and intellectual we become unless we become in contact with the mates and the Melt is there and the predestinated seed is also there so we get the word mate and the female mate that join together when they join together you are quickened and when you are quickened you are born again eternal life have come to eternal life now you are sons of God everybody okay so far glory to God my God this is what brother Branham say what is the new president you say well brother Branham what is the new birth it is the water revelation of Jesus Christ how personally not Collective personally to you amen see not you join the church you shook him you've done something different you said Creed you promised to live by a code of rule but it's who Christ the water Bible he is the one that was revealed and no matter what anybody says what takes place is who Christ Pastor priest whatever it might be it is who Christ and that is the Revelation that the church is water build upon that's why people are leaving this message because they never got a personal revelation of the message in their life [Applause] they get an intellectual knowledge but the word was never quickened to them but he not see it there is nothing to Quicken everybody okay when this message is quick and unto you amen I don't care if the pastor leaves the message I don't care if Mama leaves the message I don't care if your wife leaves the message nobody can shake you because you are born from The Incorruptible you are born from another dimension you become the sons and daughter of God [Applause] why are people leaving the message they never were born again they preach this message yes gift and calling are without repentance they preach it intellectually but they never had the Revelation but if you have the Revelation even if you don't understand everything the revelation will hold on no matter what happens something is holding me every day of my life something is holding tight that is the new person [Applause] we confuse people about the new birth until we don't know what is the new birth everybody okay be born again don't worry about the cigarette that seed has power [Applause] as it's growing up it will begin to push things out because it's Jesus Christ when Jesus entered in the temple he found people selling things he pull her up Amana Let Jesus be born in you when he gets in your house he will pull the Rope pornography out lying out cheating out everybody out throw down the mountain pull down the thing because it's the house of my husband it is the house of my father it is the House of Prayer it is the temple of God you are the temple of God thank you Hallelujah [Music] everybody okay everybody okay everybody good this predestinated here is a picky the predestinated seed is very picky the predestined the seed is so choosy it doesn't take anything he will write the stuff another word nothing can enter there except God [Applause] the Bible says this Brother Sam gave me this it slip upon me thank God he said Paul Peter says we have a water a more water sure World of Water prophecy not just a word of Prophecy and more sure a Vindicated [Applause] not a word of Prophecy a more word of water prophecy why he says where unto you do well that he did what he in other way you listen to that as unto a light that water in it so the light that is coming and sending into your heart must be a very short word a prophetic word everybody okay until the water the day down you got volume my friend and that day star or the Morning Star arise in your hearts everybody okay so to bring Jesus in your heart not any word can bring him out [Applause] foreign that seed is very picky [Applause] Amen brother Branham say if I taught you a metal this message it would do whatever it would take no effect on you why because it is water bright time the seed knows its time [Applause] everybody okay and not only does he know it's time he also know its message in other words he recognizes who is the husband if I taught you Moses if Moses taught the message of Noah he would take half no effect it's Jesus God Moses message he would take water no effect why why because the water we Destiny are laying there that were on me Be Water by that type of water water that is good for water that's seed see it won't grow and it won't grow any other condition it must be the condition the water so your predestined the seed cannot be awakened by Luther message amen it cannot be awakened by Pentecostal message everybody okay there is something about this message that when you heard it something in your warm up [Applause] everybody okay he knows where to choose [Applause] [Music] amen when you presented him Luther husband he says that's not my husband they say but he's good he said well he's a good man yeah he's a Justified man but he's not my husband that says sister you're gonna stay like that you say no problem God will give me my husband [Applause] then they bring a Sanctified husband he looked he said he can live clean but that's not my husband Amanda he's a good husband but that's not my husband they say well let you bring another one and they show you one that can speak in tongues the seed said it's a good one but it's not my husband but one day through the opening of the seventh seal the Mighty God came down and unveiled himself amen amen when you take him he got looted he got Wesley he got Pentecost he isn't got Paul inside [Applause] [Music] are put together a perfect husband a perfect word a perfect lamb for a perfect wife or a perfect brother [Applause] you are not cheap my friend come a little bit higher which message are you trying to give me give me the message of the hour give me the prophetic message yes that's why if a preacher in the message begin to manipulate the message that seed will lock [Music] [Applause] don't mix the message with anything give me the message as pure as it is don't take my David and give him the clothing of soul he won't win the battle let him come with his slingshot with his grammar from Kentucky that's the message that will deliver for me he will deliver my family he will deliver my children he will give me hope where there is no hope [Applause] my God my God my God my God my God that's why we give thanks to the water Father which made us water fit to be water of the inheritance of the water in the water like who did water delivered us from water the power of darkness and has done to the kingdom of Hope now we are born again man everybody okay everybody okay damn kind that takes the word it's God Waters bringing soft water children they can die a child the bride brings forth on the word cannot die because it is the word amen did you get it she can die because the child can't die because he is a word child he's a teacher he is a Eternal child Hallelujah that is exactly what Jesus was a water spoken Eternal child didn't have to die but he did it in order to pay them that is the only way it could be nobody else could do it there are there was all bornhaus after the water and after the waters but God loaded the modem everybody okay everybody okay now that we are changed here from this part one into part two we are born again everybody okay I'm gonna add something this Darkness is not only on your soul part two you get the first level now I go to the second level this darkness is also in your flesh because according to Romans 7 Paul said when I want to do good I found that there is water you know that right Paul says that I noticed that in my flesh there is another law there is the law of sin and death everybody okay in other words even though we move From the Inside Man the outside man is still under the influence of Darkness it's the second level I can't give you both together I have to give you the first when you master the first then I add the second everybody okay brother now we have the water Ernest right here our spirit is water running for Water full Redemption adoption everybody okay in other words they predestinated seed that is awakened here doesn't like what is outside [Music] everybody okay he's pushing so that the devil on your flesh can come out because there is still one Kingsman Redeemer he's on your flesh he's blocking boas to unite with you so now the second purpose of for us is to get the King's Men out of your flesh everybody good he says but now we have the water Earnest as we receive the Holy Spirit it is the water Earnest of a complete adoption oh complete words salvation oh how beautiful I just love that Innovation for the Salvation that's right fully in its fullness to work come but now in this Tabernacle of clay we have something that tell us that we have water how so far we are not raised completely up we are raised suffer we raise to a certain level in other words the quickening of the seed is a resurrection everybody okay everybody okay that Resurrection is also called the quickening let's go to Ephesians 2. oh God help me I'm trying to move my friend when the same your first husband died it is not your soul that is dying it is the darkness that is pushed out that darkness is that nature remember last Sunday that's the nature that goes away but your true nature was in the predestinated scene when the Lord Struck it the seed is awakened now the seed begin to grow ah it's going it is removing everything that seed is what doesn't let you go to sleep when you did something wrong ah you talk bad to your mother you talk bad to your wife you try to dodge it no no no no you tried to sleep you hear him go ask forgiveness amen and instead of just going and say honey I'm sorry what do we go there what do you do there we try to get only a political way just speaker what do you do there can I help you up and she's mad you can do amen amen and you get there you know I'm I'm sorry who trouble you to say sorry did he Whip It did he put a gun on you do you see his power it's in it's in it it's a very sweet power but he holds you [Music] you will pick up that phone and call that brother you say brother I'm sorry the way I treated you and when you drop the phone you feel oh thank you Jesus who trouble you why do you think what let's go to the division two I don't know if I'm a Child of God I don't know if I'm a Child of God it's enough of that Ephesians chapter two you there you there we're talking about the seed Resurrection Quicken verse two and verse one and you has he what quickened to Quicken means to make a laugh if they make you alive it means you were dead amen you okay now he will have quickened who were how dead amen you will laugh naturally but you were dead everybody okay so before you reach the second Resurrection you must first have the first one everybody okay everybody okay I'm preparing you for Easter he said and you has he quickened who were dead in water trespassing and water sins wherein in tampas you walk according to the course of this well according to the priests of the power of the water you were doing things for the Devil the spirit that now works in the water children of water you are not a child of disobedience because your obedience was already in you in the predestinedity so you can't help but to obey but at the beginning they didn't know who you are because they put their pants down you put your pen down that's why God taught brother Branham don't call them Ricky rickita because among them predestinated seeds are hidden there everybody okay verse 3 among whom also we had our conversation we heard our life among you among them that's why you came out today never came out your friend's still drinking till today no matter how much tape you send it to him you gave him all kind of message but he doesn't come out why do you come out he stay everybody okay in time passed in the last of the flesh fulfilling the desire of the Flesh and of their mind and whereby nature which nature the darkness the children of water even us others you look at me you won't know that's a child of God tattoo tattoo but underneath that tattoo there is a seed everybody okay but God who is water which rich in Mercy for his great love where is wherewith he loved us even when we were dead in sin in sin he has water Quicken us yeah he has done water when you were dead in sin Christ already finish your work that's why Jesus said it is it's just a matter of time he has quickened us how together together with grass by what Grace are you safe and he has done water where's raise us up together and made us sit together in Heavenly places in who Christ Jesus that in the age to come he must show the water exceeding reaches of his water Grace in his kindness toward us through who Christ Jesus so the quickening of the seed is a resurrection [Music] but you are raised so far to a certain level there is somebody a sticky nature that is still troubling you everybody okay what is the earnest it is the little down payment that holds brother Dutch it is the earnest now once we love the things of the world once when we sin and went about doing the things of the world and care not for God we were ndnated from him without god without crossing the word God sent his word Holy Spirit and through that we are whatever lifted out from those things now we have half the earnest that we know that we have passed from water and two there is a new sad resurrection that happened everybody okay now we are waiting for that the second Resurrection where now do you understand say Amen if you do what I mean by saying the earnest we know that we have passed from death and to life because we are lifted we are lift up not in ourselves but lift up from the things of the world that we love everybody and God loved us and we know it and we watch our lives and see that it is the holy spirit because we don't know more care for the fix of the world there you are as long as you love the world all the things of the world then the love of God is not in you yet but as long as you are above that then you know that you have your inheritance you are on your world to your water full Redemption so what you have by the baptism of the holy spirit is a partial Redemption [Music] you only got 50 percent everybody good William Marion Branham brother Branham say and that is the way it is with every Born Again believer you can hear all the theology you want to and all the men made discrepancy but when that word flashes out then there is something tackled you come to it you were once dead in sin that life he has done what there has to be a life there in the predestinated seed to Quicken to First God by his foreign knowledge not all things and we were predestinated to be Sons and Daughters of God ye who were once dead Ephesians 2 in sin and trespasses where would we all had our time in the past but he has done what weakened the first resurrection look at Paul when Paul was a great Theologian but when he come face to face with that word who Jesus that word was the pillar of fire it did water waking he come he come to life right quick because he was how they to be that he was part of the word and when the word so that word he was his water nature everybody clear everybody clear everybody clear let's go to First Corinthians chapter 15 now then I lay the foundation and we let you go home First Corinthians chapter 15 I'm good in time fortunately amazing amen glory to God first Corinthians chapter 15. let me lay down this and open this cargo you ready you ready you must have your scripture if not you're gonna get lost you must have the Bible you there First Corinthians chapter 15 verse 1. let's go moreover I declare to you we're preaching about the resurrection of the Dead I declare to you the gospel which I preached to you in other words Paul is repeating why is he repeating something he already preached amen Paul is telling them I already preached to you the gospel but I'm I'm gonna rehearse that again I'm gonna repeat it again to you why are you repeating before we move forward what is the gospel that Paul preached to them amen which gospel we want to know the subject of that gospel anybody here this is the subject of the Gospel in second Timothy chapter 2 verse 8. Paul say remember that Jesus Christ of the seed of David was what ways from the water according to my gospel stop push the breaker so the gospel of power is about the resurrection of Jesus Christ I know where I'm here everybody okay the gospel of Paul the gospel of Paul is about the resurrection of Jesus Christ in other words Jesus Christ was dead amen and Jesus was buried amen and Jesus rose again that is my gospel now Paul is coming amen he said I preach to you the gospel and I'm going to preach it again why you there which you have received and wherein ye stand so these are believers Paul said I preach the gospel to you you believe that gospel and you're standing on it but I'm coming again to tell you that same gospel what is going on verse R2 by which also yeah saved if you keep in memory in other words if you hold on to other picture you're gonna be safe if you let it go you don't everybody okay if you keep in memory what I preached to you unless you have believed in water so if you hold on to this gospel and you let it go you have believed in Fame you can get lost you gotta hold on to it all the way to the end [Music] which gospel the gospel of the resurrection of Jesus Christ everybody good everybody good now verse 3. we okay follow me careful for I have delivered to you what first so the first one I come when I came and I preached the gospel the first point I'm mentioning my gospel is this everybody okay what is your first point Paul I preach I delivered to you first of all that which I also receive see how that water Christ die for ours according to the scripture so the first thing Paul exposed to the Corinthian was Calvary are we okay do you follow me do you follow me do you follow me he freaks Express Calvary as the atonement [Music] are you following me as the atonement for our sins I'm sorry I'm already soaring there I can't go back anymore I must reach the target so you put your seatbelt rewire pretty good everybody okay everybody okay [Applause] everybody okay watch carefully on the board everybody okay Paul says okay when I brought you into the Tabernacle watch the board the first thing I presented to you was the present author ity because the president altar was Calvary that's why the Christ died and the measurement was three by five you come by the grace of God to reach Perfection five by three that was the altar and the sacrifice was killed right there and Jesus was killed on Calvary that was the first finger presented to you when I brought you inside I want you to meet the president altar first have I lost anyone glory to God let's go again thank you my brother we on verse three so verse 3 open the present altar in the Tabernacle are you there number two glory to God we're preaching about the resurrection of the day amen number four verse 4. and that he was how and that he rose again the water according to the scripture the second point that pointed to you everybody okay is the barrier you following me and the water and the resurrection of Jesus Christ amen where are we in the Tabernacle let's go slowly would follow the President Hotel is delivered amen amen in the letter when you accept Jesus Christ as your personal savior we take you in front of the congregation everybody okay and we bury you into the water do you follow me and we resurrect you from the world oh [Applause] everybody good everybody good so the baptism is a symbol of the barrier and the resurrection of Jesus Christ William Marion Branham since the symbol of this is assembled just like water baptism doesn't save you baptism is a sign that you are witnessing to the congregation that you believe in the death and water bear you and daughter resurrection of who Jesus Christ he doesn't save you water will not save you it is your faith that save you but baptism is a order it must be carried out because God can say to be baptized and then turn around and say he doesn't need to be done everybody okay so the baptism is a barrel and a resurrection and what we are baptizing in the water is not your spirit we are not baptizing your soul we are baptizing you we are preparing your body for something amen why because the soul and the spirit I already dealt with [Music] in the partial Resurrection everybody okay now there is one that is staying but let's bury him and raise him back again we are telling him remember remember this and this remember this and this everybody good everybody good Paul says this in Romans 6 verse 2. keep First Corinthians God forbid how shall we that are dead to us sin live any longer therein know ye not that so many of us were baptized into Jesus were baptized into his what yes we okay therefore we were out with him by water baptism into death that light class did water from the dead by the glory of the the father even so we should walk in the water newness of life because of the Resurrection you okay so if we have been planted together in the likeness of his water death by the baptism we shall also be water in a likeness we shall also we shall be also in the likeness is war of water his resurrection so when they take you and they put you like this what we are reminding you that Jesus Christ went this way but he didn't stay there because water is the multitude of the people everybody okay you went down but you're not gonna stay there brother if it happened that you go down remember you're gonna also everybody okay and you want to resurrect in his likeness [Applause] I won't touch his likeness today it's for Easter let's continue to progress Paul says this he said in colossian bury with him in the water baptism wherein also yeah so the baptism is always connected with the resurrection [Music] in other words deliver hold a mystery of Resurrection [Music] glory to God brother Paul says we're in we are also have risen with him through what faith of the operation of who God who has water raise him from the resurrection and you being water dead in your sin Ephesians 2 and their circumstances are their circumcision of your flesh he has done water quickened together with him having done water forgiven you of all water your trespassing so when you are born again it means all your sins are gone praise God my sins are gone where they are and then if the blood which blood everybody okay glory to God let's get this first Peter 3 verse 21 the light figure we're unto even is water baptism do also now how save us it does save us not they're putting away of the thief of the water flesh but it's water an answer of our water because the work is done there of a good conscience throughout who God by the water resurrection of water Jesus if you notice every scripture of baptism Paul is always connecting that with the resurrection baptize Resurrection baptized resurrect barrier Resurrection everybody okay everybody good now let's go back where we stop verse 4. and that he was buried and that he was again deliver and the third day according to the scripture Paul stop there Paul never approaches the holiest he doesn't go to the holiest but he stopped the level watch what Paul is bringing out now he begin to give testimony testimony of what verse 5 and that he Jesus Christ was sin of who which is Peter then of the water well he's saying that what I preached to you about Christ dying and resurrecting I wanna declare that to you again that when we told you that Jesus Christ rose again I'm not telling you Fable people saw him because the Redeemer must be alive and I'm gonna tell you who saw him Peter saw him the 12 saw him amen why is Paul insisting on proving the resurrection what is important in this Resurrection we okay Paul continue verse 6 after that he was sin of above water 500 Brethren at what Paul said it's not even Peter and the Apostle more than 500 people saw Jesus in love after his death in other word I want to make sure that what I told you about the resurrection is sure can I continue at once of whom the greater part to this present some fell some are falling asleep after that he was sin of who James then of all the water and last of all he was sin of who me also as of one born out of water Paul is giving all this testimony to support one thing Jesus rose again the man that died rose again Peter saw him the disciples saw him the apostles saw him James saw him more than 500 people saw him I myself Paul I met Jesus Christ why is this important job to verse 29. everybody okay you there the Bible says this he says else what shall they do which are baptized for their death if the dead rise not at all why are you baptized if there is no Resurrection in other words when we baptizing you outside we are telling you there is a resurrection if there is no Resurrection we won't bury you because the fact of doing this and doing this is a barrier and a resurrection everybody good everybody good Paul say why are they them baptized for their dead that dead is Jesus Christ on the board brother Branham say read brother never read First Corinthians 15 verse 29 yes what shall they do if they are which are baptized for the dead if the dead was not at all why are they then baptized for there brother Branham say now Brethren there is one people that believe that they baptized for the dead that is the moment the moment and I've been in the temples many times they are very fine people and you may be a Mormon now I'm not trying to hurt your feeling but my dear friend you can't be baptized for your father that is the act he had to do the way the trillions that's the way he fall Paul speaking here was talking about their dead who Jesus Jesus if the dead was not why are you baptized in Jesus Christ's name then if it's if the dead was not see what I mean let us drink and be merry for tomorrow we die if the dead was not but he goes ahead and glorify God for the water Resurrection after death and we are baptized to who Jesus dead everybody okay everybody okay what is the problem with Paul why are you coming to the correction and preaching to them this over again what is the important of it what happened in the Corinthian Church that you have to preach to them the resurrection you there are you there job 2 verse 12. now we go if you dare you can say amen amen glory to God Hallelujah Hallelujah verse 12. now if Christ be preached that he did what rose from the dead with all the witnesses all the proof that I gave you Peter James more than 500 people I saw him myself all the apostles all the disciples if this is what we preach to you amen how some among you how say some among you that there is no water Resurrection after dead do you see why Paul is coming everybody okay Paul is saying if I preach to you depression hotel and I took you all the way to the level and show you that Jesus Christ rose again and if Jesus was risen and we saw him how you people how you folks there are some among you they are a net filtration in the message there are some people that are saying that there is no resurrection of the Dead why is this important that Paul must come back again and make sure this is refreshed because if you don't hold to this Paul said you will perish what is important about the resurrection of the Dead why is it so important brother Branham he's doing it today he has made a preparation to conserve to his own purpose he will conserve a church he will conserve a people he will conserve who subject for his great water that death cannot destroy everybody okay we realize that it is by faith that we believe this but the resurrection produces the water solid foundation on which hour Faith nothing can destroy it the resurrection of the Dead is a solid foundation to the Christian faith everybody okay everybody okay let's go to Hebrew 6. I'm going to rush now if you can go with me oh God help me Hebrew chapter 6. if you dare you can say Amen oh God first one therefore living the principle of the doctrine of who let us go on to what Perfection not laying again there Foundation stop the foundation Foundation of what the foundation of water from water the present altar baptism it is the foundation and if you notice the baptismal plural did you see that there is a baptism that we bury you and take you up and there is a baptism of the Holy Ghost everybody okay Paul is calling that the foundation everybody okay but the problem is Paul is saying that among you some people are there that are saying that there is no Resurrection where did these people come out everybody okay let's go to Matthew 16. Hallelujah let's go to Matthew 16. who are these people because in the message we got people preaching that they really we are in the millennium in this message we are the people we have people in this message that are saying that everybody will die there are people in this message that say brother brought them say people disappear one by one so the resurrection let's go let's go in Matthew chapter 16. I don't know why I came across so many doctrines everybody okay Matthew 16 if you dare you can say Amen verse 6 you there I'm almost straight and then I'm gonna head to the airport verse 6 then Jesus said to them take it and be aware of their living [Music] two people Jesus said be careful of the evil teaching of who Christian and water Sadducees everybody okay what does the Pharisee believe what does the sad you see believe that Jesus is telling the Apostle I want you to be careful because Jesus knew the church is coming but that these two guys with infiltrate the message of the hour everybody okay verse 7 and the reason among themselves saying it is because we have taken no bread you see they talk Jesus is talking about something else they thought he's talking about natural bread do you see Jesus say on verse 8 which one Jesus received he said to them oh you are fully the faith one reason you among yourself because you have not bred but no bread everybody okay everybody okay job to verse 11 I'm saving time how is it that you do not understand that I spoke that has spoken not of your concerning bread of you concerning bread that you should be aware of the the level of the Pharisees and of the watch verse 12 and they understood then understood they how that he bid them not be aware of the level of the bread but of the of the who and what what are the doctrine Jesus doesn't want to get into his brother everybody okay everybody okay job go to Matthew 23. I'm gonna hit quickly and we go Matthew 23 verse 23. if you dare you can say Amen I hope I'm in the correct Channel if it's Matthew I hope I wrote it correctly let me see if I'm correct it's Matthew 23 glory to God let me see brother Robert we do would you try to find me in Matthew where Jesus asked the question the the sad you see ask him a question about somebody who have uh the woman that married seven times where is he dead it probably might be 19. Hallelujah I don't know if I wrote it wrong amen oh God 23. you can find it and you let me know that's where it's supposed to be I thought it was Matthew 23. if you dare you can say Amen oh God help me Matthew 22 Matthew 22 verse 23 ah praise God that's it instead of 22 I say 23. okay you there are you there okay the same day came to him which say that there is no water Resurrection so who infiltrated the church who infiltrated the churches everybody okay remember Jesus say be careful of both I'm gonna run quickly job to verse uh 31 you there but us touching the resurrection this is Jesus answering of the Dead have you not read that which was spoken to you by God saying I am the god of who Abraham and the god of who Isaac and the god of who Jacob God is not the god of the dead but of the water leaving what does he mean everybody okay what does he mean go to Luke 20. almost go to Luke 20. everybody okay go to Luke 20. Luke 20 I'm going to skip something Luke 21 38 if you there you can say amen amen for he is not a god of the dead but of the Living For All lift water him so to God Abraham was not dead Isaac was not dead Jacob was not dead so when God was telling Moses I am the god of Abraham I am the god of Isaac I am the god of Jacob God was not talking about the dead Abraham he was not talking about the dead Jacob another word Abraham Isaac and Jacob I love that's why the Rich Young Ruler when he went to hell he could see Abraham and talk to Abraham everybody okay how can the sadducee preach that there is no Resurrection let me nail this let's go to Acts chapter 23. then we rush quickly because I can't get to you to the Pharisee because I would have showed you what the Pharisee brought in the message there is the bringing of the Pharisee and the bringing of the Sadducees both in a message are you there let's go to verse 20 uh at the 23 if you dare you can say Amen verse 6 amen but when Paul perceived that one part why water and the other was what Pharisees he cried out in the council man and Brethren I am a Pharisee the son of a Pharisee of the hope and the water resurrection of the Dead I am calling what a question and when he had said so there was a water separation started again the fight started a message amen between the Pharisee and the services and the multitude was what divided when they want to crucified the word made flesh in power they come together but yet they are enemies everybody okay watch verse 8 for the sad you see say there is water no Resurrection neither Angels no Spirit but the Pharisee Confessor both so Sadducees remove the supernatural from the church and we got Mercy churches that are dead they don't believe in the Supernatural at all everybody okay everybody okay everybody good we got Mr churches cold how can the sadducee follow the law of Moses and do not believe in the resurrection Elijah Rose a boy that was dead the child of the will of serifah and Russia came and another boy died and was resurrected and a man that they were going to bury in the scripture everybody okay hit the bones of Elijah and resurrected Moses Resurrected Jesus was Lazarus Jesus rose the winner the daughter of jerias Jesus rose the son of the will of men how can after all this Resurrection in the Old Testament among the believer somebody doesn't believe in Resurrection everybody okay everybody okay what is important about the resurrection what is important let's go to First Corinthians 15 and we finish what is important about the resurrection if you dare we can say Amen I'm skipping a lot job to verse 21. verse 13. you there the question is there verse 13 let's finish but if there be no water of the dead then is cross water now reason and if Christ be not risen damn is our preaching house and your faith also is whatever you cannot preach this gospel without the resurrection of Jesus Christ [Applause] everybody okay everybody okay let me drop down again we are on Versa uh verse 15. yeah and we are found how false Witnesses of God because we have testify of God that he raised up class whom he raised up if so be that the dead Rises for if the dead rest water not then is not glass Water waste watch carefully and if grass be not raised your faith is what vain you are yet in your sins in other words without the resurrection there is no quickening of the seed [Applause] because what save you what could save you what delivered you from your sin was the power of the Resurrection if the resurrection is not there you cannot Quicken the seed [Applause] let me explain it again in other words without the power of Resurrection there is no new breath [Music] amen sorry let me go to uh go to First Peter 1. so I make my points lay in the scripture glory to God First Peter chapter one first Peter chapter one oh God help me you there First Peter chapter one job to verse 3 if you did I just made a statement verse three blessed be the God and the father of our Lord who Jesus Christ which according to His abundant Mercy has water begotten us he has birth us begotten he had birth eyes again to her Lively Hope by the water resurrection of Jesus from there so the best the new person is coming from the power of Resurrection if no Resurrection no new birth and if New Birth is there he means we will have the change of the body [Music] a little bit festivity chapter one let's go to First Timothy chapter one and I can lay this plane I can't touch the pharise the Pharisee First Timothy chapter one you there you can say Amen you there you there help me push this so we can go verse 18. everybody okay this charge I commit to you son Timothy according to the prophecies which went before on you that's you them that that you by them my world a good Warfare holding water and the good conscience with some having water put away concerning Faith have made water some people have run away from the faith and they are destroyed which Faith amen verse 20 of whom is who amenities and who Alexander whom I have delivered to who Satan that the men learn not to water the man their name is Paul tell me for him to set them because he blaspheme what did this man say we don't know second Timothy chapter two let's see what this man say how many years second Timothy chapter two if you dare you can say Amen you there you met you there first uh 15 study to show yourself a proof of God a Workman that need not to be well a shame rightly water dividing the word of water true you must know how you're preaching the message because you want to shipwreck somebody for they will increase tomorrow water ungodliness ungodliness everybody okay and their word will eat as does of whom is who amen is the word of this man was like anchor La cancer eating up the body what was their word everybody okay Verse 18 who concerning the truth have done what saying that there Resurrection is water passed already and offered through the faith of water so somebody was preaching that the resurrection already happened we are in the millennium [Music] everybody okay everybody okay how can you preach this after the Old Testament is embedded with Resurrection the life of Jesus Christ embedded with the resurrection how can you preach that there is no Resurrection when Jesus Christ himself says that I am the resurrection and the water so the resurrection is a person without Christ there is no Resurrection everybody okay he's saying he that believe for me don't he be water he shall do water that's why Paul cry he said that I may know him which is love and the water power of water his resurrection and the fellowship of his water suffering being made confirmable unto his water if by any means I may attendance resurrection of the Dead why is Paul looking for the resurrection of the Dead a man adore him in the power of the word Resurrection why because the resurrection is the foundation if there is no question reason from the dead you cannot have the new birth the new birth is also a proof that Jesus Christ is alive [Applause] everybody okay and it's the spirit that Rose Christ from there there dwell in water he will also do water your water the resurrection of the soul is a preview for the resurrection of the body [Music] you cannot have the body change without the soul change without the new birth nobody change but if you got the new birth it's the earnest it's the guarantee it's the Assurance that's one day my body will be changed everybody okay we are waiting for the water fullness of water this will take place when at the first resurrection that is one hour body will be water from this water wow creature that we are in I have a body like his son glorious body for we shall see him as he is and we shall be like when he appear we appear in his water likeness we will have a body like what is a glorious glorified body and all child and struggles of life into a water and blow away to never be water no more [Applause] I'm gonna hit the airplane down now and the Very God of be sanctify you have holy and I pray your whole spirit and water so the two in the baptism of the Holy Ghost are taken care of and your water body which is waiting be preserved how how can you preserve the body pregnancy unto the coming of the Resurrection himself everybody okay and fulfill is he that eat water who also will go do it so the one who would do the one who will preserve your body who would change it so your body become blameless is the resurrection himself everybody okay then when you become subject to that Spirit it throws your heart be subject to the water that spirit is nothing in the world but the seed of God the seed when made how manifest or whatever Hallelujah when the Bible said don't do this that body quickly do what do it there is no question and what it is it is the water Earnest of the water Resurrection this body will do whatever because it's already started let's hear it it started by the resurrection of the new birth everybody okay it already started he once was subject to water and water and water but now it's got there Earnest it turns out heavily now that is the earnest that you are going in the Rapture it is the water a sick person laying dying nothing left about water that is all that can happen I have seen a shadow of people don't eat up with water cancer and water and see them personally a little while after perfectly how [Music] Resurrection the resurrection have your healing the resurrection have your new birth the resurrection have the change of your body

death is in your life ask God to send the power of Resurrection that power is not only to Quicken your seed it is there to change your body to touch your business to touch your home to touch your marriage everything that is dead can be brought to life that's why we don't lose hope because even if when hope is gone when Lazarus is in the Tomb four days gone amen the resurrection can pull him out I don't care where marriage is down I don't care how bad deep the marriages the power of Resurrection can touch the marriage and take the husband and bring him home know him in the power of Resurrection the power of Resurrection the resurrection of the Dead is a foundation we know we're going to see brother Branham because of the resurrection of the day Comfort to one another with this word that their dad did right in Christ will rise again amen if not why are we living because tomorrow we die amen but if you dead you're not dead really we know that you are somewhere it's just a matter of time and one of this day the resurrection will come and when the Resurrection comes he bring the resurrection with him and we all will be quickened in a twinkling of an eye with a shout with the voice of the Archangel and the Trump of God and we will be all changed together why by their power if the same spirit that Rose cross from the dead if we dwell on you he will do what it will Quicken your mortal body let's pray Heavenly Father Lord once again we are approaching you humbly father thanking you for your grace for your love for your mercy and for refreshing our mind our spirit about the power of Resurrection father many things happen in our life where hope is gone sons have left home and they're gone like The Prodigal Son but father no matter what the circumstance all the situation seems like we become hopeless Lord until Mary told you he's already dead he's thinking in other words no worries to trouble yourself I know you could have healed him but it's already too late you look at me you look at Mary and you ask her a question yes and she push it again in the future she say I know that he will rise again in the last day but you told her that not the last day you right there in the present time you were the resurrection that's one job when he saw you he could scream that I know that my redeemer leave don't the skin worm destroy this body but yet I'm gonna
