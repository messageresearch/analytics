TRANSCRIPT
========================================
you you you um light time way out in there and is still moon you thank you morning it was a spirit and her and the lady was a fine friend of mine but from that night on she deliberately hated me of course you can see why it was well then when her husband came and we knelt in the room to pray then the Holy Spirit came down that was it then he appeared to her husband that night in a dream he came back with a dream he thought of a joke he come to find out it was a very answer to his wife's healing how that the holy spirit did deal on down into Tucson with brother Norman and them and there the Lord begin to work again with great powerful things and revealing things one night what drew me to this conclusion here I was standing with brother would brother saath Minh and we were about 10 o'clock at night and I was looking up towards the skies and a great all came over me and I said just look all that great heavenly hosts and I said everything is perfectly in harmony and brother Wood said looking at two little stars so close together that made look like a light I said but you know brother would according to science in that dipper the Little Dipper the Big Dipper those stars don't look over about two inches apart and they're farther away from each other than we are from them and if they start to this earth it would take at thousands of miles an hour it would take hundreds and hundreds of years from the reach the earth and I said in all this great vast system here and yet they tell us that they look two glasses can see a hundred and twenty million years of light time way out in there and there's still moons and stars and yet God made every one of them and he sets in the midst of them and I said somewhere in there I had pointed out to me one time in an observatory the zodiac beginning with the virgin coming over through the cancer age and on down until the last was the line Leo the line the first coming of Christ for the Virgin the second coming by the Lion of the tribe of Judah I said I've tried my best to see that zodiac and I can't see it but yet it's there those who are trained no it's a joke saw it man used to look at it it was a Bible it one day but in that whole great mass of millions of billions of light years God sits in the midst of all of it and he looks down Paul is in there my mother's in there somewhere looking down and I thought of the ardor of that heavenly host not one of them's out of place everyone keeps it's timed perfectly God's great army a thought of the soldiers how that if that moon would happen to get out of order the earth would be covered again with water just in a few minutes the earth would be just like it was when God decided to use it for to have us here on it it was without form and void and darkness and water was up on the breadth of the earth if that moon would ever move it would do the same thing again when the moon rocks a little bit away from the earth the tides come up when it goes down just follows the tides it's God's are me when I thought about the that being God's great army they're not we went to bed and then I begin to think that not one of those get out of their place they all set in place and if there's a movie [Music] Lulla Henry hey on the floods many days he serves forlán him bury us the way bubbles he had some but not probable God gave us his son on the wings of the song on the wings of the show why God's in his cute sweet a sign from all the way the same sounds goodness Jesus our say was born in a stable in a manger of hey eh eh [Music] God gave us his on the wings of God singes you sleeveless I'm prom on the wings of let's bow our heads Lord how thankful we are Lord did we have another opportunity Lord to come in your house Lord to worship your Lord according to the revealed Word of the our Lord Lord how exciting it is to be a part of these times Lord God we just thank you Lord for everything that you do for us every day Lord you keep a safe Lord you protect us from harm you send your angels down to protect us Lord and just watch over us Lord God but today Lord is today a resurrection Lord and we know that this message has come on the wings of a dove for us this morning Lord God and we just ask Lord above anything else Lord that you have your way Lord anoint brother Stephen Lord as he comes out Lord with the word Lord and anoint -

is here go8 beings are possible Jesus easy god bless you all this morning good to be back in the house of God so if you would let's go straight to our scripture same Scripture we read last week we appreciate the brother in the board I asked them if there was a possibility we can keep our series in a successive way so we can go all the way and finish it unless somebody's burning with something so we appreciate them for the grace that they have given unto us to go ahead and continue with this if Genesis chapter 15 verse 3 it's just a recap of the same Scripture we read last week we read 1 or 3 words and I let you be seated if you dare you can say Amen [Music] they give you 30 extra minute instead of 12:00 12:30 so you relax and be fine because we're going to get into deep water Genesis chapter 15 verse 3 and Abraham say behold to me you have given no seed and lo one born in my house is my hair and behold the word of the Lord came to him saying this shall not be your hair but he that shall come forth out of your own bowels shall be your hair we were talking about Eliezer of Damascus but God told him it's gonna be Isaac but that's the natural revelation then God move on into a different Horomia first father and he brought him forth abroad outside and say look toward the heaven and we mentioned yes week that the heaven is speaking about the zodiac and tell the star if you be able to number them God told Abraham go ahead and count the star but Abraham was not able to cut the star but be graceful today you gonna see there is one person that is able to count this star and he knows the numbers of this heart he's only one person and we're gonna see that person he said look now toward heaven and tell the stars if you be able to number them and he said to him so shall your seed singular be Paul taught us in the book of Galatians it's not plural it's angular which was speaking of Christ and who expressed to you last week that it's talking about the zodiac because in the earth in our sky we don't have any stars the star are in the universe in the zodiac so all of that speaks of Christ let's go to the book of Genesis still in the book of Genesis chapter 37 same scripture last week because we were halfway of our sermon so that's why I'm calling this sermon part four be so last week was part for a this is part four be because part five is already ready to go are you there Genesis chapter 37 verse nine and he dreamed talking about Joseph he had another dream and told it to enter did his brethren and say behold I have dreamed a dream more behold the Sun in the zodiac and the moon zodiac and the eleven star we know Benjamin was not born here so the birth of Benjamin was already in a star in other way there was a star in the zodiac that already represented Benjamin so one brain German he was born in this earth the zodiac already have something representing him because brother branham said before God does anything on this earth he first declare it in heaven so before even Benjamin was born his birth was already declared in the zodiac and Jacob mislead are you there 11 stars made obedience to me and he taught it to his father and to his brethren and his father rebuked him and say to him what is this dream that you have dreamed shall I Jacob is a son here he is representing himself as the son he is explaining the vision or the dream he says shall I and your mother we showed you last time that Jacob had four women so Leah Zilpah Bela and Rachel but in the zodiac the one represented was Rachel that's why Jeremiah said there is lamentation in Ramah nature he is crying for her children not we are not Zilpah but Rachel are you there those Prophet were line up with the zodiac and your brethren indeed come to bow down ourselves to you to the earth so there is something or a mystery hanging up there let's go to the book of Revelation chapter 12 you're gonna hear me all the time speaking about mysteries mysteries mysteries I am NOT preaching new mysteries I am preaching reveal mysteries the message of the hour is mysteries in the voice of the seventh angel all the mysteries this message is literacy I was talking to a brother on the telephone I say there is a different sound about this message when you preach it differently it is different than any kind of message Revelation chapter 12 and there appear verse 1 a great wonder in heaven a woman clothed with the Sun again the Sun in the book of Genesis we know that Sun represented Jacob here there is another son but we have to find out what as this particular Sun represent but we glad brought a team Greely we have a prophet he knows that code when I say we have a prophet and the moon under her feet and upon her head a crown of twelve stars in Genesis 12 star the first book of the Bible Sun Moon trav star revelation last book of the Bible Sun Moon twelve star are you dead and she being with a child cried travailing in birth you might be seated as we continue crying cried travailing in birth and pained to be delivered and they appear another wonder in heaven we introduce here the constellation of Jericho which is the constellation of the dragon if you study that you see that that constellation is between the Big Dipper and the Little Dipper I didn't want to get on that detail there having seven heads and ten horns and seven Crown's upon his head and with his tail we talked about they tell of the serpent with his tail drew the third part of the stars of heaven so we're talking about stars here they are twelve stars but they are also other stars in heaven Abraham was stars Joseph twelve here twelve and other stars we gotta find who are these twelve stars and also the other stars are you there and then he stood before the woman which was ready to delivered for to devour her child as soon as he was born and she brought forth a man child which was Christ who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron and her child was caught up in other rapture to God and to his throne so I believe that's good for the reading of the word you might keep your Bible and make sure you comfortable at home cause we're gonna travel deep let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we thank you for your grace your love your mercy and for everything you're doing for us Lord father you have given us another opportunity and grace to be able to gather together and run they reveal word because you spoke in your word Lord father that's where the carcass is there the ego will gather Lord father your prophet toward us Lord father that's to have a fresh true revival we need to bring the people back to the word of the hour and that's what we do in Lord Father so that the book of fact alone once more Lord father can be written for spoken word Tabernacle father may you move me completely away may the Holy Spirit made inside the teacher may you come down this morning Lord father this afternoon father and Lord father nourish and quicken the heart of your children Lord ministered to them according to their need Lord be the Alpha and the Omega Lord touch those that are present here and those that are Lord father in an invisible audience Lord father we commit them unto the hand in the name of Jesus Christ amen god bless you so like I said last week was part 4 a and this is part 4 B of the unchanging pattern of God we express that Granum toward us that God has three bubble we want you to keep that concept when we talk about the zodiac always remember it's a bubble and brother branham say there was one written in the sky which is in the universe there was another one in the pyramid placed by Enoch and there was a third one brother Branham say it is what we have in the written word because it's the age of intellectual and God put it up in the print so that we can have it but the key there is the revelation in the written word and revelation in the pyramid and the revelation in the zodiac all those revelation they don't contradict one another so if you have some time difficulty understanding the zodiac you can refer back to the written word and you'll find out that the written word can open up something to you to understand this Odia sometimes if you cannot understand the pyramid if you go to the zodiac the zodiac might help you understand the pyramid that's why the last time that we spoke the other time that we spoke about the pyramid we first went with the two first sign of the zodiac the first which was the Virgin and then Leo the Lion once we understand what those two signs mean he already unlocked unto us the key to enter the pyramid and to see how the Bible or the message was written in the pyramid as long as you don't get those keys sometimes you can get long so all those three revelation line up together so last week when we start talking we went back to the zodiac and we insisted about the North Star because what Branham told us in the mystery of the North Star that the North Star was the center of God he also said that the send the North Star was the center of the zodiac everything in the zodiac revolve around enough star and brother Branham told us also that that same North Star was also the center of the earth so when Enoch came he knocked the pyramid and when Enoch built the pyramid we found out that Enoch geographically brother branham's they positioned the pyramid lining up straight to the center of the earth so if you can read in between the line because the sage is not really what you reading by pre-baby people are reading the Bible they don't understand what it means and many people are listening to the tips reading the message but still they don't get our remains because what Branham say a mystery is a truth that was first heated then that truth is revealed but rather Branham say even though the truth is revealed there is still a supernatural element that is locked in despite the revelation so we must connect with the supernatural element we must connect with Christ in order to understand the message of the hour if not your message will be intellectual you can fill your brain with a bunch of knowledge but your life will never change you can have a religious spirit or use this message just as another religion just as the Baptist as the Methodist as the Pentecostal but this is a message altogether different are you there so brother Branham when he told us that the center of the earth was the North Star and then he came back and he said ëno Center the pyramid in the center of the earth automatically in between the line brother Branham is telling you that Enoch line up the pyramid with the North Star and once the pyramid has been lined up with the North Star Vera Branham said no matter how the sun is shining around there is no shadow here on that pyramid the Sun can be on the east the Sun can be on the north the Sun can be on the south or whichever direction is there is no shadow to it and brother Branham insisted to the young people and to the young women he said line up with the knob star because in this life you want to go through difficulty trouble and everything but as long as you have the guide whatever I am preach a message the guy as long as you have the God as long as you have the enough start God will work you up through those difficulties God will help you up to overcome those difficulty because your eyes are still on the North Star are you there if you look in the book of Revelation you will see that when the New Jerusalem was coming down from heaven the New Jerusalem is a city also in the form of a pyramid but if you notice the scripture says when you look at the New Jerusalem on top of the city the land sit over there if you have a question just shoot brother David and then we go to the scripture I don't want to say brother Stephen saying I want you to say brother branham say or the Bible say why do you always say that the Bible say because brother Branham say the Bible is the absolute so if the Bible say brother Stephen why do you have to say again brother Branham say I say brother Branham say because the absolute interpretation of the Bible today is the message of the hour that's why I say the barbosa and brother Branham say are you there ok so when you look in the Bible you will find out that on top of the New Jerusalem they are there lying on the top of it there was a lamb bloody brother Fred usually sing in the city where the lamb is the light in the city where they cometh what no night if you look in the scripture you'll find that in the New Jerusalem the Bible says that there is no light either there is no night because on top of the pyramid the pyramid is Center with the logos with the Lord with Christ so once Christ is sitting there there is no more shadow there is no more darkness there is no more night there is no more trouble so that's why we insisted young people you go ahead and you land up with your Saudia that why the bubble when Solomon came Solomon say teach your children what bring up your child according or train your child according to the way but what is the way when Jesus Christ came he said I am the way the truth and the life because Solomon said if you train them according to the way in other word if you train the children according to Christ when they grow older they now go it's not going to depart from them and brother Branham when he came he say sometime they might depart from the way they can pax lead some time but the way won't depart from them are you there if you notice when Jada where now Daniel was in Babylon Daniel trained the babylonian how to study and to look at a star and when the babylonian were trained to look at a star they begin to understand and read the zodiac so when they were reading this earlier because they were trained by the scripture of daniel they were able to catch the birth of christ brother Branham said there was many star gazer there was many people in the earth but none of them knew that Christ was born he said the one that recognized the birth was the star gazer because they were trained by a prophet they knew how to look at the zodiac and when did they stop for two years no problem the way was given unto him the way was trained to them they were brought up under Daniel with the way and they were following the star but when they got closer to Jerusalem they begin to get influenced from Jerusalem they begin to think how big Jerusalem was they begin to think how it's the city of the Great King it's the City of God it is the spiritual city of the jewel so maybe the star or the cross must be born dead they were trained into the way but the reach a certain time in their life where they deviate I'm going slowly from the way and they enter into Jerusalem and they miss it brother Branham said that star stay outside are you that when they enter that they begin to ask the people where is the King of the Jews who's born and nobody knew there was a king that was born they were following Christ they were following the way they were following the star but they got caught up into denomination that's one when you enter in this message stay connected with Christ don't get into the click of the message don't get into the move of the message don't get into the ideas of the message because those idea can move you away from the principle or the main thing when the search Jerusalem they found out that he was lucky when they came out we're gonna say the star was standing ready and they begin to follow that same star and that same star led them to Bethlehem are you there that's why I got what I'm saying if you live crossed somewhere you need to go back to the place where you left them and that's where you're gonna find him still waiting for you so young people stay connected with Christ all people stay connected with Christ don't get caught up with Jerusalem don't get caught up with this preacher this preacher this preacher stay run up with Christ the message is Christ I cannot emphasize on to that praise God then when we begin to look at the 12 major sign of the zodiac I'm just going to touch quickly and then we move on we found out that we talk about the Virgin we express the version that it was fulfilling their coming of the seed of the woman they coming of class who have to come to crush the head of the serpent because in Genesis God gave a promise God even expressed to us that the seed of the woman would crush their head or bruise the head of the serpent so that's why we are we explain the constellation of the Serpent's because in the zodiac the serpent itself has a constellation and we talk to you I believe he was part three if I'm not mistaken that the constellation if I can erase this slowly that's the constellation of the Serpent's was a constellation that was split into two if you remember there was a part of that constellation if I can job very good we're talking about a serpent here that was called the head of the serpent that's why we expressed with Moses that the constellation was head the head of the serpent because serpent kaput which means the head of the serpent and the other part of the constellation was called the tail of the serpent or serpent Cora Cora means tell are either and we express to you that when Moses came in God told Moses to touch the serpent by the tail not the head and we explained to you that they had will sing they tell was the attribute of sin that's one when Moses came in he heard them if someone committed adultery you need to kill him when Jesus Christ came in they brought a woman that committed adultery and they caught her on the very up so Moses the Ministry you have to manifest something physically for them to catch you so when their brother has said Moses taught us this woman if we find out we need to kill her but when Jesus Christ came Jesus mom find that to a certain level Jesus say you wait until a woman is caught into adultery to kill her that's not the problem what the woman what the man was doing is just a result of what happened in the heart that's why Jesus say if someone look I dare not go to the hotel and pay money and go with a woman and no that is just an attribute but once you look at woman Angeles after her you have already committed adultery in the heart so the adultery that you see somebody doing is already started in the heart the political Shoom that sin in the heart that ministry that mystery was unfolded by James let's take the book of James I didn't plan on this but I feel like we need to see it take the book of James you need to keep your Bible today if you dare you can say Amen are you there alright let's go to verse 13 chapter 1 verse 13 the Bible say let no man say when he is tempted I am tempted of God these stuff are very essential that's why we want to make sure we drill them into the church for God cannot be tempted with evil neither tempteth he any men but every man watch now in stented when he's drawn away of his own lust everybody clear don't say brother Stephen say and entice so first of all you looked at a woman and you begin to last after him are we there now first feel of verse 3 of 15 then when lust has conceived in other word when that last gave birth idea when that lust has conceived he brings forth sin and sin when it's finished oh but you bring forth death so James is telling you that same process first you the one that look at the woman then you lusted after her then when you lasted after her you consumed that sin in your heart you birth that adultery in your heart once adultery is birth in the heart then whatever you doing it's just a manifestation of what happened in the heart so Moses say you need to get the manifestation Jesus say go back to the source get him from the heart when you clean him rather then once the worshiper is purged there is no more desire for sin when he look at a woman automatically the love star move his head he's looking at a woman anymore because the knob star moves the head away straight hair is gone so when the constellation was expressing to heaven he was a constellation that was split into two one is the head of the serpent the other one was the tail of the serpent now if you look at this head of the serpent in the zodiac this head of the serpent was closer to the constellation Vigo which was the halation of christ the coming Redeemer of Christ to bruise the head of the serpent are we dead and in between the head and the tail there was another constellation I told you we going to get in deep water that constellation is the constellation of Lucas I let you google it yourself you know the constellation is a man I'm going slowly and this man hold the two side of the serpent and this man was called the serpent bearer again when the Roman look at this man they call him as clickers which was a hero God for him I'm going slowly are there and this man as clueless here had a rod rather of it I hope you connected he has a rod and the rod was into an with a snake and the Roman took this son and put it in medicine I didn't but brother branham told us that they make a huge aboard they make a perversion of the sodium they make a perversion of the pyramid they make a perversion of the rigid world but that still does not hinder the true message because when we go in the scripture we find the manual so that was bearing the serpent I let us down that man was Moses Moses had a rod when we try to the ground it's a serpent when he touch it it's a rodent when he goes to Egypt are you following me and he told us that the stuff he turn into a serpent so this constellation here was speaking about Moses in between the two dispossession bringing the law the law was a temporal resolution to hold sin don't commit adultery don't those still don't do this in just the temporary but they could not clean the worshiper are you there so it was a temporary solution to handle sin or to decrease the effect I didn't applaud the believer and once they do that Paul say before sin came before they lock him I was sweet go check Romans seven he said when the law came Sid Ruiz Vava look at 1:7 in other word when you bring a piece of cake and you put a cake on the table you say brother John say the whole family can eat that cake there is no problem and most of the time you will see somebody grabbing after a while nobody even pay attention to that cake are you there by this brother John bring his cake and brother John called si I don't want anybody to touch this cake down low magnifies fin then Lily who go running take my goodness how can daddy bring the cake and that and say don't touch it in other word temptation begin to take over because the law was placed there now everybody is interested about we need to get okay are you there that's what they'll or did so what Moses came in Moses when he brought the law per se in magnify sin because God wanted seemed to come out completely then he can chop the head of seed one time are you there so when the Roman put this on they call the son the son of medicine that's what they say but we found out that the serpent bearer was Moses and Moses also put up a sign are you there in the Bible and that son the Bible say in our John chapter 3 as Moses lifted up the serpent are you there in the wilderness so shall the Son of Man be also lifted up so they said this is for their God what is our prophet talking about design let's see what brother Branham say you know the stature of a perfect man I was talking to a doctor one time and he was just waking me over the cause a bad word divine healing was standing on the street he said mr. Branum you only confuse people say there is no healing only through out medics in other words through medical he happened to turn around watch carefully I believe you can see it on the screen look at his son on the car this is not woman this is Malachi 4 because at the voice of the seventh angel all the mystery of God must be revealed he said look at his son on the car had that serpent on a pole brother Stephen say no I say you better take off that subject son of your car then because your own sign testifies that God is a healer the Roman say he was the son of their God perversion brother Branham said the son of miracle is the son of Moses a real doctor believes that that's them quacks yes sir the serpent on the pole Moses lifted up the serpent on a pole he said I am the lord that heals all your diseases and they look at that serpent for divine healing another one praise God in the seventh year that's not even discussion here I was talking to one of the finest doctors there is in the southern state in his office not long ago a very fun specialist in Louisville a real gallant man and I said to him I say doctor I want to ask you a question he said all right I said I'm not this your medical Siler I am correcting the wrong teaching I didn't by the message of the hour and notice your medical sign the stuff you got a serpent wrapped around a pole what does that stand for he said I don't know and I say he stands for this brother Branham now is interpreting our zodiac I will stand for this he was a symbol of divine healing where Moses lifts up the brass serpent in the wilderness it which was only a symbol only a symbol of the true cross now today medicine is a symbol of divine healing and through many of them don't and don't many of them don't believe it will good doctrines do believe it but some of them don't believe it but they're very and lemma either the emblem of a serpent in the pole is not the emblem of Roman god it is the emblem of Moses which was representing Jesus Christ are you there the emblem that they hold up testify the power of Almighty God whether they want to believe it or not whether you take brother Branham or not that's your problem I believe brother Branham I am convinced therefore I am concerned hallelujah see that's right there is the brass serpent hanging on the pole on the medical and bloom so when you look at this constellation right here in spoke about they tell the attribute of the serpent of sin and Moses comes right in between trying to hold the two pieces together until we go comes the head of the woman bringing cross to crush the head of the serpent any question this message is not something to play around now as we begin to maneuver over this son we express to you that the other son was the sacrifice we talk about the ordered error which was showing the direction then we talk about the twins which was Judah and Jesus and Judah came back on the church as the spirit of the white horse if you can remember last time which expressed the Sagittarius which was the center and that spoke about the vessel then the lion anointing came up to fight him then the devil changed to the word horse rather then the officer 19 came to follow death as a victory then dead [Music] Oh they'd ever change to the third sill because on the turn sir the devil's coming up with a scale which was speaking about Libra which was coming with a scale now what we are buying this son here this son does not apply now to your individual life I don't want you to look at people that are born under Libra saying the devil of the church still though this is applying to the church changes we're going to get to your individual life are you there and then when the devil come into the full force to the third horse rider we found out that Luther came up as a Capricorn as the spirit of men are you there the anointing of men and looters standard as a fish if you remember last week the gospel then ended up being a good and we were trying to find Wesley so now make sure your seatbelts are buckled up pretty good so we had to sign left here one was the cross fish is brother Michael oh Mack buckle up please he knows what I'm prayin saying that he certainly it takes last week so and then over there we have the cancer so we were trying first to remove the cancer we found out that when the angel of the Lord met brother Branham he only mentioned cancer there were 39 sort of category of disease but he only mentioned cancer telling what a problem that you are living in the age of cancer either so but when we win it brother branham brother branham keep taking the cross wishes and the cancer and sometime it separate and most of the time he mixes together but when a made a mistake no in the message have anacs-- nd first time cross Graham was through the Virgin next time he comes through the Lion of the tribe of Judah the cross fishes separate the cancer age comma and all as you read it through as job studied because we saw that job was the one who was looking at the Pleiades and the little bear and things like that taking up the armor of God now this is the problem he said what does the zodiac star of the Virgin what does he end with Leo de Lyonne the first coming of Christ and the second coming of Christ we are now in the cross wishes the edges say cancer a brother madam say cross wishes we choose the cancer age component but today we're going to it up on you there now when you look at the son of fishes I'm gonna go now slowly the son of the fishes have to fish not three not four true fishes and we also know that fishes represent the gospel and it speaks of believers I'm going slowly because when Jesus met Peter he said Peter you are fishing natural fish you come up here I'm gonna make you fishers of men not rich men even in the vision of the rainbow trout of the third Pole the rainbow trout which is a fish with the rainbow D covenant and I need to be clutched by the third pole that was representing the believer in that vision but one of the rules he was teaching preachers how to catch fish and the angel of the Lord said I told you don't teach Pentecostal don't teach those babies these kind of things and he gave brother Branham a vision well brother Branham has a Shoeless follow me very careful it was a big shoeless shoeless but brother branham had a small baby shoe so brother God was trying to get the big shoeless shoeless and trying to put it on the eyelid of the small baby shoe and God can he say you are trying to teach baby technical stuff spiritual swing supernatural things so damn shoeless brother branham the angel explained to her goddamn that's the Shoeless was that supernatural either because they came to rather bottom they said why do you struck women and all this kind of stuff teach us the big supernatural things of God but when I'm say if you don't understand your ABCs there is no way I can teach you algebra so when brother Branham was trying to teach them the first ball he said you do this and then you do this the second pool then the the impersonation came God say you are taking supernatural stuff you are taking the shoelace and you are trying to teach it taught to the baby the shoelace represented the supernatural are you there and when John the Baptist came and let us think okay John the Baptist say I am NOT wanted to do it I'm either I'm not waiting to unlock his shoelace John the Baptist found himself not worthy to touch the supernatural that's why the Bible st. John did no miracle you need Molotov or to go get to that one are you there are you there so let me come back to where I am so we find out that those two fishes we're too so why are they - why are they not four or five so first of all fish talking about the believer speaking about the gospel we already understand that then the second part fish lives and travel in water we have two fishes which we know speak about two believers and we know that fish travel in order and we know that water according to revelation 17 multitude of people so this is zodiac Sun is telling us that there are two believer I'm going surely that will be traveling into the multitude of the people - believer speaking about the gospel carrying the gospel in the multitude of the people now take your Bible relax give me my timer and let's get there let's go to the book of Mark chapter 6 those who are here have a benefit they already got a scripture on the board if you dare you can say Amen mark chapter 6 you there you can say a man what a devil are they saying amen okay praise God mark 6 verse 7 and he called unto his 12:12 disciple specific and began to do it when God sent someone the sending of somebody means apostle or missionary say an apostle or a missionary is somebody that is said if you need a coat I help him you see me and the Bible say that he began to send missionary apostle send them forth how why did Jesus send them to edit on he begin to send them by - and - and give them power over unclean spirit when Jesus was sending the disciple to go preach the gospel he began to send them to - - and we find out that the price is have to fish take the Book of Luke chapter 10 Radek Alima this is steak this is not appetizer are you there verse 1 Luke chapter 10 verse 1 are they saying Amen brother David okay Luke chapter 10 verse 1 if you dare you can say Amen someone say Amen okay praise God after these things the Lord appointed other certainly the first time he was 12 this damaged 70 other 70 also and sent a post-op missionary and sent them two and two are we there before his faith in every city and place we he himself would come so the gospel when Jesus was sending the disciple to preach the gospel to be apostle to be missionary Jesus was sending them two by two when Sam stone wanted to destroy the field of the Philistine he took two foxes let me get the swim brother Dean I hope I didn't join you he took two foxes and put fire today then he sent them to the to the field to destroy the Philistine - - - - but those foxes myself fire the word became flesh now John the Beloved the Revelator and John there is a revival John is here in the Bible but John Saint John the one we are speaking of this morning an apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ a missionary said that by God a missionary is one that is sad they're very word itself mean one that is said if you need more I have 36 are you there praise God let's go to Matthew number chapter 14 we are trying to decode the zodiac brother Michael mark now it's your turn Matthew chapter 14 verse 17 if you dare you can say men did they say men of their word David Oh God and they say unto him we have here but what five loaves and where the Stephen say two fishes he said bring them in here - and he commanded the multitude to sit down on the and took the five loaves and the two fishes and look up to heaven he blessed and brake and gave them love to his disciple and they disciple to the multitude and they did all eat and were filled and they took up the fragment and he remained two loaves are two pieces father loves to have remaining let's go to Matthew chapter 15 the next the next chapter Matthew 15 verse 15 verse 34 if you dare you can say Amen okay if somebody says a man we good okay praise God and Jesus say unto them how many loaves have you and they say seven and what you see loo fishes we don't know how many fishes here he only says few and few speaks of minority rather rather to hope you awake please God and he commanded the multitude to sit down on the ground he took the seven loaves and the fishes and gave thanks and brake them and give to his disciple and the disciple to the multitude same thing and they did all eat and were filled and they took up the broken meat and he was left word okay we get into the mathematics of God if you need a code for that one you see me we found out here that Jesus and the disciple two by two your fishes to go preached the gospel and they were missionary and when Jesus wanted to feed people this was natural but if you look on the spiritual there is a message lying riding Jesus took two fishes the number don't change plus five loaves loves speak bread which is the word I'm going slowly but this word is the world of growth I'm going slowly five speak of grace he gets two fishes either with the gospel of grace to feed the people when the people are fed he remains a basket thank you the number of worship after the gentle church urges eat the ministry is done through twelve basket relax on the next chapter he get three no fishes which is the minority plus seven loaves settlements completion this was found the other one was Southern Cross wake up I hope you gather and then when we feed the people they remain seven seven does not change but for magnified to twelve to bring worship today but number one if you look at these fishes there were dead fishes we are in the deep water either you die to our fish that took the fish other water they kill it you following me then they clean up the fish you follow me then that season the fish then they put the fish into the fire shake yourself a home before you preach this gospel you must be taken out of the world you must die to your sin you must be cleaned up and sanctified and God you have to bring the Baptist Messiah then they can combine you with the five robes to preach the gospel of grace and they can combine you with the seven loaves to carry the seven course meal where do you get stuff like this let's go back there buddy Redemption by power and now none of it to remain everything talking about the lamb he said when you eat it don't eat it raw or sudden but you must eat it well cook radically Matisse's well-done steak and I like that people trying to eat the word and they take it like that it was wrong chew it and spit it on and everything say oh I just can't take it I can't stand it it is not cooked done in us that's all watch it now he said cook it with fire fire presently that fish must be taken out of order clean up and then the back but does that fish which the Holy Ghost with fire that's why Bradham said nobody have a right to preach the gospel without the Baptist what's the whole ghosts represent the holy ghost you get God in your heart first he shall cook it for you like it's cooking now that's right cook it out what done and what daddy touched good let's go to the dedication of the building let me drop down here may there be such a feeling here of the blessedness of crust the sweetness of the spirit until men and women who follow from all part of the city and around about to hear the gospel from here made this congregation so be what season and what with what with the baptism of the Holy Ghost until they are called the salt of the earth so this finishes the two phases must be seasoned shorted with fire they bubble say that the law was given by Moses but grace and truth came by word so first the gospel of grace have to be preached to the Jetta after the gentle finish and dawn then twelve baskets are left for the twelve tribe of Israel let's go back here my brother zechariah 10 i will pour out upon pour upon the house of David and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem the spirit of what the gospel of grace must be given to the Jews but when he grieved to the Jews it is twelve and twelve speak of worship and Jesus taught the disciple he says and the true worshipers shall worship the father in work and in water that's the Father for the father seeketh - it's a ghost that's gonna preach to the hundred and forty-four thousand to bring them true worship everybody let's dig deeper in the message of grace but when I'm speak about the zero bubble and the coming stone and when the stone comes but they say grace grace double grace not just good grace and grace both of them mixed together grace but grace oh my god let's let brother Branham interpret Zachariah listen very carefully I just read you the scripture where the bottom is gonna interpret Zachariah 12 prophesied this about 2500 years ago it was just about to take place listen and it shall come to pass in that day that I was sick to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem and I will pour upon the house of David brother Branham is explaining it the house of David and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem the Spirit of God and supplication and they shall look upon me whom they have pierced they Gentile already have that because we recognize Jesus as the Messiah not the Jews I'm gonna go slowly now when the gospel returning to the Jew what is the gospel return to the Jews when the day of the Gentiles finished the gospel is ready to go back to the Jews oh if I could just tell you something that is about to happen right in this hour day either this great thing that is about to happen will carry over to revelation 11 revelation 11 is Moses and Elijah preaching today we're gonna be saying there is something that's going to happen in my ministry apart from the spell of grace that I have been preaching there is a second part of my ministry that is going to happen to me but that second part will carry over to the Jews I'm going slowly regulation 11 and pick up those two witnesses Moses and Elijah those two prophets Moses and Elijah turning the gospel back to them we are ready for it everything is in order as the Jews brought the message to the Gentile by rejection of Christ even so the gentle would take that robe back to the Jews by what the Gentile kicking quest out of the touch rejection of Christ and the rapture will come are you there now let's get to the features quickly and so Rob Appell we know it's the greatest priests that come up let me skip this one let's go right here neither will a Christian eat on a dead carrion from or denomination doctrine they want the Word of God fresh promise for our God promise rabbits in the day of Luton he promised other things in the day of other but now he promised us a full square meal the full seven-course meal seven bread either the servant for all the servants here are open everything is ready for the Word of God and what we call servants here to the Jews it is the southern trumpet there is no new message that will come up after this message that's why when the gospel goes back to the Jews the same message of the hour will be again brought to the Jews but it's called the seven trumpet twelve thousand twelve but seven does not change seven loves seven basket the number don't change seven seals seven trumpet the number don't change I told you I'm gonna take you in deep water the Fist of the chopper now notice the continuity of the scripture exactly the same under the seventh chop it is to Israel the same as death was today let me drop down here notice the losing of this ecclesiastical spirit I told you about the two the twins now 20 years later after that work we see the losing of the ecclesiastical spirit what under the seventh day seven today and then so we have far droves bringing the gospel of Christ and then we got the mystery of the opening of the seventh year but he won't change it will go there but still this number seven will also bring worship watch out this is the time when everything must what we worship and we'll remember how appropriate now don't let us miss this now listen when all the mysteries of the church age is was finished when all the mysteries of the planks of redemption then what 7 she was right immediately after this it is done for all everything in heaven and earth to do what are either down here we listen water what worship this was the elder the Beast everything fell right before him see that when he made his complete plan it's Dom of what so far gospel of grace going back bringing worship to the Jews and the seven field going back here bringing again what worship worship worship the one is seven thousand it takes just one octave of grace hallelujah let's go back to our Philadelphia churches we found out that there is two fishes preaching the gospel those two fishes are what missionary they are what apostle we are trying to bring Wesley now if you can bring the camera to them update a tradition of the seven temperature changes which age Philadelphian now listen carefully don't say brother Steven see Revelation 3:8 I know that works behold I have said before doing what an open door and no man can shut it but what I'm interpret now we will specifically let me go slowly dwell on the open door that no man can shut first of all I want to dwell on the open door as signifying the word tremendous what missionary effort of that touch you see a passage let me drop again look well call a new missionary endeavor for the Lord err no pendo first correction to have furthermore when I came to throw us to preach Christ's gospel and a door was opened unto me so we can see by the comparison of the scripture that this open door signified the greatest spreading of the gospel to the world that have ever seen the two fishes traveling in the water brother Steven can I have one more to confirm this yes my brother or sister you're going to get it deciding Church edges the wind blown and the little tassel fell off like that entropy that is Wesley sanctification see that was the greatest missionary edge we have ever had has been there Wesley search in during the time of Wesley if an exceed this edge is separating that from now addition the Westland churches he was a missionary in scattered scattered the two pieces godsend that the two pieces so why is brother Branham taking Wesley and putting Leslie with the cancer you there whatever I bet followed is good in order to understand the worth of training involved in behold I have set before you an open door and no man can shut it we trying to now see why brother Branham is combining them listen very carefully don't say brother Branham messed up we must now recall what has been said about each age running over into another age overlapping okay ready John there is an overlapping a melting or fading into it even though the church ages have specific date when the random said they didn't stop like that they stopped by one age beginning into another age and ending into another it is called the principle of overlapping okay reading into rather than an abrupt end a clear-cut it doesn't stop like that they age left into another age okay this edge which age Philadelphia the age of Wesley the age of the Pisces watch very carefully this age all the flow this age particularly flows into the message we're gonna say the Pisces is flowing into the castle Alleluia and not only does this edge of the floor okay into the last stage but the last stage what's very careful is in many respect simply carrying on of the six edge that's why the random is saying cross wishes cancerous cross wishing cancer e brother branham is saying that the six edge if you look clearly the seven edge is just a cameraman of the six H they said down here if you can just think of the season you can get a very good picture of it they plant that you see growing in full strength in summer suddenly appear to be going to see you can't tell exactly when summer became autumn we cannot tell we just know that the temperature is changing but when we don't know it just fed into it that is how the edges are and especially these last two they fell into each other that's why cross wishes cancer cross wishes cancer brother branham and make mistake then when this came Luther Wesley for him then the antic was changed and he picked up the pelvis rather and the cancer which is death but when he picked up the cancer age then there is another anointing they have to come to combat him that anointing now bring us to the constellation of the ego shake yourself couch of seatbelt you are home so let me give me give me grace now the constellation of ego is called the Aquila constellation there is a man in the Bible that was married to a woman the woman is called Priscilla you will see Aquila and Priscilla Aquila and Priscilla if you look at the word Aquila it means ego if you need a scripture right there okay there is a constellation called the Aquila constellation or the ego constellation the constellation have twelve star now we are getting into our scripture are you dead and the brightest star in the constellation the broadest of four star in that constellation is called altar you can google it if you want it what has Ultra me okay when we study our scripture we found out that Joseph's dream have 11 star the Sun and the moon and Joseph right in the middle which is a star 2 and Joseph told us that the Sun represented Jacob and then the moon represented version the zodiac interpreted then in the book of Revelation we found a woman pregnant with a star with the Sun and also the moon at her feet but that woman also has 12 star make sure you buckle up pretty good now what does this woman here signified let's go to Malachi 4 over there we found out it was the tribe patriarch and Jacob and Rachel the mark of the beast what does a woman represent the church clear this is the brand this is the church the real church a woman clothed with the Sun brother Branham is interpreted and the moon under her feet the servant head the moon under her feet the Sun was the dispensation of grace and the moon was the dispensation of the wrong the woman was the Orthodox Church and she was standing over the law the law was passing away it was a overlapping Jesus is bringing a gospel of grace and the law health to give away that's Paul said that the law become obsolete right then death law was passing away because law was a shadow of good things to come is that right the moon is only a shadow of the Sun reflecting now let's drop down so we understand the Sun grace the moon law now the twelve star and under her feet and upon her head a crown of twelve stars the church is burned with the doctrine of what if you need more code see me so brother Branham explained to us that the Sun over here is grace the moon was the dispensation of the law and then the twelve star the 12 apostel 12 star in her kron four's 12 what apostle that the 12 apostel was the glory or the crowning of the new testament for no other foundation can be laid the night which is already laid see it's the foundation the New Testament the a personal the doctrine of the apostle and so forth is funding crown of the New Testament so this son dispensation of grace the moon dispensation of the law what about Jacob brother Branham German election in Abraham are you clear justification in Isaac Gracie would clear anybody dies the red Jacobs life no you have to believe in grace it's gross in Jacob the identified masterpiece of God Jacob which means supplanter and that is a deceiver and we lost that Jacob life really represented because he was all the time with Jacob your son grace your moon Bella Jacob son grace if you notice Rachel when they come to marry him either Jacob work seven years and he was in terrible to get richer when he was dead to get richer his father no swap nature to Leah when he woke up in the morning he say hey this is not my wife this is Leah and they open up to him the law lets the sick either they say there is a custom there is a law here before you get the younger you must get the order Leah yellow your custom are either Leah represent richer represented your law your custom are you there so the Sun here graves Jacob grace there are further dispensation of the law the law with lecher you cannot take lecture without passing by the law by the custom of the length you must take the older first before you get richer you pass it to the law either then twelve a person and twelve patriarch 12 plus 12 24 elders I'm letting the sink that's why in Revelation 21 verse 9 and 14 you will see that in the New Jerusalem they are the name of the 12 apostel and 12 patriarch we don't know if this represents this what about our Eagle update we found out that Jacob has 12 star and we found out that Aquila have 12 star so what is the ego meaning brother branham help me up you still in tune in the message the Messiah let me drop down here I like to watch the big ego make sure you get your seat belt you know that father ego you know God call himself lingo I'm going slowly did you know that he call his prophet he goes she were hidden he told that let me job now we found out he calls himself ego too so he is Jehovah ego and then he's got a bunch of eaglets eaglets like Messiah Inglot I'm trying to get to the ego with curved star we already know that Jacob has 12 son idea remember God is amigo he called himself a word and ego and he called Jacob what idea he called Jacob amigo so Jacob is illegal and we found the constellation of amigo with 12 star just like Jacob amigo with 12 patriarch are you there you are Queen er constellation who was speaking about Jacob are you there with 12 star but one of the stock is brother than any star it is called altar now when you look at the 12 tribes when the trans tribe were camping into the desert the tabernacle was right in the middle with three part and there were three tribes on the North three tribes on the Sarna is three tribe on the west and three tribes over there and again on the east the burner was the banner of Lyon which is your anointing on the first two changes on the south the burner was the banner of men on the east he was the banner of an ox and on the top he was the man of Niger and that the Inca was represented by the tribe of Dan let's go back day Revelation chapter 4 oh my what what Dan was he was here that's why he was here somebody been reading the Bible he was a ego Ruben was the man he was the first one the weakest one of the bunch because he wanted to his father's concubine and live with his father concubine see that's the immoral of human being the animal don't have done them more amorous they lie on none of these things but the man does run with the next men wife and so forth he was Valbuena was explaining the anointing that was a Mingo and Reuben was the main face in frame and not that there is the way they camped in a bubble he said Anne is the head of the three tribe Judah is the head of the tree tribe Reuben is the head of the three tribe a frame is the head of the tree trap three force is 12-12-12 of what israel each one with their banner the burglar was Judah was the lion the banner of Reuben man the banner of the frame of the banner of Dan was a legal now when you look at the word altar it meant a flying eagle the brightest star of the constellation of ego was altar an altar is interpreted a flying eagle in the book of Revelation there is four beasts there is a lion there is the odds there is demand and a flying eagle which was speaking about the ministry of brother Branham right in your zodiac right in your zodiac brother branham that was his ministry what about his birth three stars like Mars Jupiter of Venice she said they crossed their paths this is the woman explaining word one and come together there were three wise men that come to meet the Lord Jesus and one was from the lineage of him and one sham and the other just a watch this now when they meant together a Bethlehem the three star there they form in another code but Abraham stated from one are you there every person on earth I am getting now down every person of nerve see they have something to do with the star please allow me to go to the end we cannot postpone this I didn't say ask the seller there when the moon goes out and the heavenly planet goes out they tied it doesn't go with it or coming in other word tell them the zodiac is influencing the movement of the earth that's what it means there and say well your birth the birth of brother branham not only is alter speaking about the middle three of brother branham as a flying ego for the anthem but the birth of brother branham has something to do with the star up there all right this is stake those twisters weren't together and meant the one star the hang of the crust and they say then why they separated they never went to their orbit they'd never been since so they explained rather Branum that before Jesus Christ was born twisters line up when the twister line up because before God does anything on earth before God bring Benjamin on the earth he first served to declare Benjamin in the zodia either so before Christ was born three stars line up when the lineup Christ was born where and the Aries in April and what class was born those three stars separated again are you there but the woman continues he says now all the stargazer in the country could never see such as that and they never notice it he was just supernaturally given and on talking like that with all of her staff well I could not understand what she was talking and she said that woman in a common narration in commemoration of the greatest gift that God ever give to the earth he said that something lesser brother branham is not God something lesser in commemoration of that time so when brother Branham want to be born those three stars line up again when climb up brother Branham is born as a lesser why the three star of question have to line up at the breath of brother branham we have to arrests of people if you need the scripture see me I'm going to show you that in the Bible then I'll take you to the message the Bible says that there are twists I have that in the Bible you need a Bible verse for that I will show you the three races we have the jente we have the Jews and we have the Samaritan brother Branham says Samaritan laws have two Jews half Jetta if you need to see that in the scripture I can sit with you and show you how the nation of Samaria come because when Israel was taking to captivity the Babylonian brought people in there in Israel when the people didn't know how to worship God God begin to send them lion to kill them then they'd ask for the priest that went to captivity to come back when they come back they begin to enter Mary that where they create the nation of Samaria at this American are you there when Jesus Christ came down he have to unfold the Ministry of the Son of Man to all clinicians for some reason when Christ came Christ are found that to the Jews the son of the Messiah he afforded to the Peter Peter barcelona's you are the son of Jonah and so forth when he met the woman of Samaria because he said I must need to go there is something important I must deliver in samaya before my death I'm going to Jerusalem to die but I need to do something is among when he did it he unfolded the same ministry to this about it but he never told it to the Delta he was a ministry thou should have been done by Jesus Christ himself but when Christ died and he rose again the body of Jesus Christ was taken and placed to the throne in heaven now the gentle never seen the Sun now God have to look for the another body to express himself if God goes back and pick up the body of Jesus Christ and come to the earth the rapture take place so God leaves the body of Jesus Christ and God needed somebody else that's why brother Branham say he is borrowing my body the body of brother Branham is not the body of God you don't borrow something that belongs to you the body of God is the body of Jesus Christ but because this ministry have to be expressed God helped to borrow someone according to Genesis 18 that's why brother Branham said in Genesis 18 that man was not Jesus Christ but when I'm saying notice Jesus was not born today he was a tap to show you that in this end time God will choose somebody that's why brother Branham awaited turn his head like this he said remember Genesis 18 brother Branham was not telling you remember Jesus Christ no he was pointing to a body that was not the body of God remember Genesis 18 are you de and give the Messiah son to the genta that's why through a lineup came up another tree lineup came up but what came up is lesser either so because God must use brother Branham because of the atonement of Calvary because cancer will open up a way for God to enter into men are you there and if you notice brother of it the men of Genesis 18 was not a baby swallow that God created a man that was an adult either he was not an teenager that's why when the pillar of fire came he could not use brother Branham he was just telling his don't drink don't smoke because I have work to do when you grow all day when you mix when you match the picture of Genesis 18 it was not a baby me and you God can let us go to the nightclub and drink and come and preach the gospel when we are converted but not rather Branum brother Branham II even though the desire was there to drink the pillar of fire stop it because it's a different ministry you cannot destroy your body you cannot play with women you cannot play with alcohol you are born under an answer right Val and I'm just waiting for the time to grow when I check Genesis 18 I check you I say this is the time now let's go man defense the son of the Messiah but you must be able to separate the truth we are not worshiping brother Branham we are worshiping Jesus Christ but put by the brother in his place please let me finish this sermon hallelujah in the very day you got a brother mark the slide over there I want them to see that we in the very day that the Son of Man is what revelation 10:1 to reign it when you get home the servant angel message opening up the sir what is it I want spoken word developer to get this shocking pretty good because sometimes we accused of things that are not true in our worshiping brother branham we are worshiping Jesus qua spoken word get this very good what is it not the angel is the son of man are you there but the messenger brother branham oh he's revealing the Son of Man Jesus Christ can you get it separate now that is where he seems to be so hard for you you see not the son of man himself but this central angel William Allen Branham the seventh messenger William Allen Branham it is revealing to the public the son of lead attorney my head is not William Allen Branham it is a revelation of the son of length through the Messiah sod you must be able to separate the two brother branham birth ministry zodia alter his birth they star and we told you last time that brother Branham say the fourth bubble was what nature he was a bubble within a bubble even the name of brother Branham was written in the bubble nature can you position that I'm using a different gun brother Halima I stop and look up on the mantel standing on the gap and I seen those seven hills where the Branham was driving him and Aleppo he look and he saw a mountain with seven years now here I want you to see something there was seven peaks on top of a mountain one market but seven peaks that run several miles the last mountain before you go into the other country no more mountain after that after that one no more Montes the seven seals seven trumpet no more mountain and he was running from east to west look at the direction of the Sun the mountain said he was snow-capped on top the first two small Peaks and then a large peak give me my time one mountain one two three four five six seven first two small peak then one big then one Lord's and then another sloppy and then another Lord speak another small another Lord please God and then a small peak and a great large snow Cup then a small cheap peak here emigrate not much not just large but a great okay a great Lord snow-capped mountain I said lord I do not understand what that means

zodiac written in the star written in nature okay let's get to the last one are you still alive okay we found out that in Genesis so we got brother Branham clear let's go to ours we found out that in Genesis Abraham God draw his attention to the star then we found that in Revelation there were other stars also besides the 12 which is the 12 apostel there are other stars that they dragon Judah to the earth so we got the stars there with the tail of the dragon and then we got the other one with Abraham what a stomach now listen carefully let me reposition my belt very good now if you notice when goes Binks you could well in heaven I wish I was in school I would give you ten minute break those beings were in heaven he's talking about Revelation chapter 12 he gives the picture of a woman standing there moon at her head and the Sun they Sun at her head and the moon under her feet and the red dragon stood to devour the child as soon as he was born he took his tail and pulled the third part of the stars of heaven and cast them to the earth brother branham help us up now did you notice that now that does not mean that Satan heaven long hook all around the people but they tell that he told he's talking about the life we thought we talked about it last week and pull a third part of those stars you clear now those stars were Abraham's see Joseph only mentioned the patriarch are you there Abraham Joseph only mentioned the patriarchy but Abraham was shown the whole foods version they said number them I cannot number too much now Abraham say Oh God told Abraham look up to the sky and Number the Stars if you can he say I can't do it he's saying neither will you able to number your see they're stars brother Dean I am launching deep question an answer who is the bright and Morning Star we back in the Bible Jesus of Nazareth they're brothers that ever lived in human flesh higher than brother brother we already talked about it he is the bright and Morning Star he is the seed singular of Abraham coming through Isaac and we being dead in Christ take on Abraham's seed and our hair according to the Prophet here he comes so the stars of heaven represented the spirits of men here either deranged drug on Rome under its persecution hugging a turd of star and cast them down that was and the crucifixion of the Lord Jesus when they rejected him and cast him and had nothing to do with him there was the third part of the angelic star so before the Jews who rejected Jesus Christ on earth physically only heaven are either the zodiac their spirit already rejected Christ in the zodiac I'm going slowly we are in drip water so the plane is moving a little bit so they captain Jesus Christ is on flight so relax if you not this job chapter 38 so what he say when when were you when I was creating when the morning star where that shabby get this I don't have any choice I got a job in the 78 changes they star which he is holding each star talking about the seven star please pay attention on this one could we just stop a minute I know I've got about 12 minutes ago almost my time here now but maybe a little bit more and I want to get to this chapter here and read it to if nothing else I want to get this to you brother branham what are you trying to get to us that is so important okay brother one a star was a minister he's talking about the 75 and a minister anointed with a spirit from above praise God easy oh that's the seven star we already talked about our star brother branham now we're talking about us do you realize that to you brother John brother brother Brian brother David brother Michael brother Marcus sister Edie sister Sharon sister visited my sister Friday do you realize that you represent a star in heaven not only brother branham and every star in heaven represents you what a Branham where are you going with us did you know God told Abraham what a Branham is explaining that his seed will be like the stars of the heaven first they were the dust of the earth and then in the resurrection the word they stars of the heaven enumerable did you realize that did you know Jesus was the bright and Morning Star the greatest star of all the stars of heaven hallelujah I think it my soul leap for joy there is there in his likeness in his presence we shall be seated someday hallelujah when the Finks of this earth had passed away we already understand that each one of us have something to do with a star in heaven in the zodiac I'm dropping again deeper further what I'm saying there little deeper they dig deeper those star don't look don't look over about two inches apart they are farther away from each other he said when you see two star closer they are far away that's what he means and I said in all this great vast system he's talking about the sodium and yet they tell us that they looked through glasses can see hundred and twenty million years of life way up in there they're still moons and stars and as an and yet God made every one of them and he said in the midst of him remember Benjamin was sitting there in the zodiac I let you signal each one of us have a representation in the star brother Robert remember the so that is a bubble just like you got representation in the scripture you also have representation in the zodiac are you there okay and what the grown-ups say that God also it is running okay God we can accept it yes God is easy God created everything let me drop again deep are you there man used to look at it at the sodium he was a bubble at one day but in though in that whole great mass of million and billion of light year God sit in the midst of all of it we good with that right we remember God is the Great Creator he sits on that predicate praise God easy and he looked down watch now Paul is in there I let you swallow that this is steak brother oh brother Steve and Paul is easy Paul is one of the seven messenger so if brother Branham was in the sky Paul also was in the sky so there is no problem we got brother Branham in the sky we got Paul in the sky is one of the stars seven star easy to believe let's go down deeper Paul isn't my brother brother brothers mother my mother is in there somewhere looking down what a brother mother was dead brother branham say over there Paul is ready whatever I'm saying when I'm looking I see Paul I see also my mother what's going on okay let's break it down so the RAM and the lamb will eat take some 147 because sometimes we can go and you say the young people don't get it we're gonna break it down so the RAM and the sheep will get it if you dare you can say Amen what a David tell me if somebody saying Amen from 147 verse 4 somebody already gathered probably by the miles mark I hear you already some 104 is 447 verse 4 are you there remember when God asked Abraham to number Abraham could not are you there now we want to see somebody who knows the number are you there hahahaha praise God let me go by first so you know who is that he the Lord who the Lord the Lord does build up Jerusalem he gathered together the outcasts of Israel he heals the broken in heart and brain and burns up the wound he tells who is he the Lord he tells the number of the stars not Abraham God knows but the science aids billion and billion he tells the number of the star he who's he again the Lord he calls them all by their name so each star in the zodiac has a name who know the name we don't know the name it is God who knows the name and it's good only the who can call the star either you have a representation in the zodiac bubble the Lamb's Book of Life you have a representation in the written bubble the Lamb's Book of Life are you there and when you wind the zodiac the star offices of heaven there is one star that is connected to your life let destiny and a star have a name the book of life contains name name written in the book of life before the foundation of the day so the braga contain name the zodiac continue name but no one can call except God are you there so when your time is come up where's your tongue 11 something will be declared in the zodiac you hear people in the world say he studies brighter he studies brother have other people saying that your star is too bright your studies - right there is teach the truth there is something about you in this area when it's time for your birth when it's time for your new birth God will declare your brand in heaven God will call your name and when your star respond in heaven something in the earth is going to happen to your life how am i go it is my time how am I going to know God is calling me how am I going to know master is vibrating this is deep water this is deep water my brother now watch the alleged search you believe in election sure I will never put in the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world we was selected by God by his foreknowledge he elected us you ought to be thankful to God that he was elected that is what I'm so thankful about that's God for me he caused his start by the name okay charge me I never chose him he chosen because remember Jude told us that they are also wandering stars go check the book of Jude that were predestinated for condemnation they are also in the zodiac because in the book of life they are named also they have to be he weighs like Judah those name that was taken of the book of life the zodiac also have wandering stars are we clear I hope I didn't join you brother denied okay no man can come to me you only take God accept my father chose him first all the father has given me welcome to me if he calls you we are talking about happy reckoner if he calls you he would not get your dog that's the time for you to come now brother Stephen how am I gonna know God is not in your mother I'm going slowly I told you injured in deep water if you were in the full knowledge of God then you are becoming a part of God and the only way you can be a son of God or daughter of God you had to be part of God and God is not complete without you has to be that's right because there is one only one resource of life and that is God and him alone has eternal life you are a part of him in so much that you are an attribute because remember in living world when apply explain to you that we were touched in the man of God and those thought was first expressing their zodiac by putting your stars then God expressed them in the pyramid then in the written word today okay Oh in his thinking in the beginning and that because he thought of you in the beginning he gives that letter tag I'm going slowly he gives deluder tab towards me to told him that is what has to be quicken so there is when you are born your heart is designed with Otago I'm going slowly okay and that dad is something that God will quicken to pull you toward him we trying to know because what Adam said when he's looking he's going to look at you but how is he looking he's knocking by a toggle in your heart when they don't begin to vibrate in your heart it is they look all the colours God where do you get this stuff you need to teach this very clearly we can be blurred by the new birth are you there Jude chapter 4 land of old for them to this condemnation predestination that turns the grace of God into lasciviousness correctly for a den of all to this condemnation God for a den it like Pharaoh giudice carry out that many of them if you look in that book you say wandering stars stars in heaven by those name will be raised from the book of life you don't on God's property if God gives you a what a tub I'm trying to explain you you need to understand how God call that's why brother Branham say work on the procession are you there if God's give you a tad easier ok Malachi 4:2 turn there your tag cannot come from your bread from the heart at the heart though be most thankful person there is in this building tonight so brother Branham is saying if you feel when they're preaching the gospel and something is vibrating in you be blessed to know that God gives you greater Branham is interpreting the dog he's interpreting the time God gives you the Prince Regent a dagger in your heart is the Princeville edge God calling you to come into his kingdom and not at your door heart and search you you might be one of them out there that is on the outside of the kingdom in other world you could be another Judah another fair but if when they preach the gospel something's vibrating to you your star is blanking but it's given future home are you there where the bottom is calling people to pray say remember me in prayer brother madam I want to be so bad I don't want to miss it brother Branham I'm checking I'm doing everything I can but I prayed but pray for me now with you god bless you why you are thinking of it now just pray God it's in your heart see if you feel something what toggle tingling I'm explaining you clearly because at the at the standing of the seven angel all the mystery tingling at your heart that is what it is it is that attribute trying to declare itself when they are preaching something begin to burn brother Branham say that burning it is the attribute of God that is wanting to birth itself into you he starts from your star are you there nothing will be saved only those name who were put on the Lamb's Book of Life before the foundation of the world their book brother Branham is explaining the Bible remember the zodiac is also the Bible written by stars and those stars containing and the Bible is a Bible written by letters and those letter contain your name but how is the name written the book hold the mystery and the book is only unfolding it now each one's name but what the mystery of the book is while it's calling those name what are you saying what is Stephen brother branham can you break it down please their book does not say now reveal mica Demi you won't see that in the Bible yet brother Michael is in the Bible you won't see your name in the email in the star yet your name is in a star it's a mystery that God hope he say now Lavelle is to be safe in the term of the church ages or all my neighbor whoever no it doesn't say that it just shows the mystery I thought the mystery of what the thing is but we ourselves by faith revelation because that tag is tingling something in you will be inferred to yourself individually and you believe we're going to get to the opportunity not overcome we are given what a white stone it's in the Bible I'm trying to save them now a new name I will give him a white stone and in that word stone there is a new name that no one knows that what the Bible say except the one delivered it's a personal revelation don't make any difference what people say you know yourself when you have been brought into the interval you don't need nobody to explanatory no one could tell you any difference not because you don't change because you did this or that but something just tells you you got a stone that is in there it's a revelation that was tingling a tag those are folding the attribute of are you there not hard stone because God promised a heart of flesh a soft one okay this stone make your heart soft instead of hard oh but it's even get it here will name be confessed before the Father in heaven let me go to him now I have been told by those who know that they Swedish sound to a human hear is the sound of that person's so when they are preaching the gospel and you feel something sweet something tingling something vibrating you are just hearing your name how people love to have their name before the public how they love a claim but no earthly voice will ever send your name as sweetly as with the voice of who it is God calling the name of the stars are you there if God's name in is in the book of life and we meant there to be revealed before the holy angel what a day that will be when we hear Jesus say father they confess my name before men in the days of the earthly pilgrimage now I will confess their name before thee and the Holy Angel now let's get down we can finish it up now what they star do star give a lesser light is that right well what does a star shine phone if I could walk out tonight and see the great bright star yonder shun but when I'm saying if he goes outside he look at the star and he asked this very question I say little star you sure are beautiful what makes you shine like that well if he could talk he would say brother Branham I am NOT shining either well what's make you shun it is something shining on me see it is the sun shining on me brother branham in other word it is Christ shining on me are you gay brother brother I just happened to light up the path for you that's why Jesus said you are the light of the earth Christ coming into your life you become you you begin to light people pathway well the true pastor in the pulpit if he is anointed of God it is not the pastor shining it is not him a good preacher it's not him a good pastor it's the Holy Spirit shining on him giving the gospel light praise God let's go to current and 15 and then we finish with della scripture you might have to review this sermon over you there first Corinthians chapter 15 if you dare you can say Amen verse 41 brother of it are they okay there is one glory of the Sun everybody Simba and another glory of the Moon and another glory of the stars for one star Dhafir from another star in glory the sun has it glow the moon has its glory stars children of God have their glory but Paul is saying that once is different than another star in glory spoken word Tabernacle spoke jealousy stop backbiting accept one another the way God made us to be one star is different than another star in glory if brother Johnson's good acknowledge that accepted if brother Abel sing good acknowledge that accepted enjoy if brother Mikey Holloway is preaching acknowledge that accepted brother Steven is preaching acknowledge that accepted don't fight one another because you are not fighting the man you are fighting God who made darling the way here is every sister cook but they cook except the other sister the way she cooks don't fight her go criticize her don't backbiter accept one another the way God made you why Paul say because one star is different than another star in me when Fighting's muddy Wendy Channing we were fighting God himself that's why when Paul met the pillar of fire the pillar of fire never third pole you thought leader you thought so and so he said why are you persecuting me I am the one who made them out the way they are team leave brother Brian to express to his face let's run around play the planner because one star is different than another star there is something about Brian when he touch the instrument he can help the something about brother David he knows what to do with the computer recognize one another one-stop divert from one-stop his glory you're a teacher I'm a teacher still we might be teaching differently acknowledge one another the first thing I went to that person and found their birthplace I would deal with this in the new birth when we will begin to study the new birth I went to that person and find their place their birthplace when brother Branham was talking to the person he will ask you where were you going and what sign your zodiac what sign that you were born under and could tell what their birth was but when a minute element where were you born under which zodiac sign I don't preach this so you go to the horoscope in the website and trying to look at those messed up stuff are you there whatever Adam say he would take a look Oh Brian you were born in America okay under which sign brother branham poodle once brother branham combining those two elements he said I could tell what their birth was it's a whole mystery is they which way is sex in their nature nature sets them in a certain line you are behaving a certain way because of different element are you there then when they are reborn I'm going slowly in other words when you come to nature you have the place you aboard place of birth you have the zodiac in the zodiac we just saw that there is a star also there representing you are you there and then you have gene from your parent that's why I say I want to deal with this separately and I'm going to show you the gene from your mother the gene from your father how these things come up are you there and then brother branham say these stuff right here gene from Mama gene from Papa zodiac imprinting a software into you because people born under a certain Sun sometimes had to behave a certain way because the zodia complete a certain character are you there then they bred for place when you grow up in America brother branham say every country have a spirit that's period imprint on you are you there so once you get a mix up like this you're already in a mess because this will set your natural life is certainly if you look at brother Branham who his father was Irish but his grandma was Indian burn originally they were I wish I wish I wish I wish I wish and before brother Branham was born God bring took his grandfather to Texas you need a coach see me when he went to Texas he was looking he saw an Indian he said like that woman she looked good he said man you Irish what are you doing with an Indian woman say no I need to marry the woman took the woman marry her brother branham said there was were to break that ouch line bloodline he introduced an Indian but when he introduced the Indian blood brother branham is born what is in the Irish that God was rooting what is in India that God has to introduce an Indian blood because the anointing of brother branham assaulter is Elijah the prophet Elijah was a man that is always in the bush and Irish don't have it I wish every character that brother branham unfolded that character in heaven I'm not going to say it today either then God bring Indian to mix that nature of Elijah and brother branham automatically loves to go into the wood because the lunch must be reflected and in division after are destroyed once more brother Branham was wearing what in Indian an Indian chief go check could let me go back to what I'm doing I let you in a suspense on that one handle it later when they are we born they are over here in another nature you found out in this nature that's the inside remember the first conscious of the servant conscience there in the inside conscience the outer side conscious move you in one way that is your natural birth so these son gives you a certain way that's why when Jesus come here look and economy see sir you must be born again because rebirth is the only thing that can clean up this stuff but the conversion don't take good stuff away I have cooked that's why brother branham made a statement like my conversion didn't take this off if you are an African you get the Holy Ghost you will still eat fufu if you are American you ate your hamburger you get the Holy Ghost you will still eat hamburger it's not gonna change you they're only girls only we'll take away B and Tech's walking away but he will live whatever is necessary you see the head brother John here your birth in the zodiac brother branham birth in the zodiac brother branham in the nature his ministry in the nature you yourself in the Bible
