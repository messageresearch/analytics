[22:15] like being there
[22:18] brother sam i know you're listening in
[22:20] but
[22:21] you should have been here
[22:24] but anyway let's pray
[22:26] father again we come before you father
[22:28] and lord we just thank you for
[22:30] bringing us all here safely father
[22:34] lord we know the roads are very
[22:35] hazardous in this
[22:37] age that we're living in people rushing
[22:39] to and fro trying to and like your
[22:42] prophet said where are they going
[22:44] where are they all going in such a hurry
[22:46] lord but you brought us here safely
[22:48] father to
[22:50] to gather around your throne father
[22:52] to worship you in song and praise father
[22:56] but lord most important to come and hear
[22:58] your word father
[22:59] and lord may you break the bread of life
[23:01] to us this evening father
[23:03] lord brother shem lord what the prayer
[23:05] request for him father we just lift his
[23:07] name up before you father
[23:10] and lord with brother sam what he's
[23:12] facing tomorrow lord we just ask you to
[23:14] be with him father
[23:16] and and lord as i went the other week to
[23:19] the doctor for um a thing that was going
[23:22] on i told my wife i said they're not
[23:24] going to find anything amen and they
[23:26] didn't find anything
[23:28] amen and lord we speak the same thing
[23:30] for brother sam they're not going to
[23:32] find anything
[23:33] and lord let that word go forth father
[23:36] because you said your word were not
[23:38] returned to you void father
[23:40] lord as that little dub was out here
[23:41] when we pulled up lord walking around
[23:44] the parking lot lord that brother robert
[23:46] said some people would look at that and
[23:48] think nothing of it but father we looked
[23:50] at that and just like like the infidel
[23:54] lord that
[23:55] he said he lived in that in those
[23:57] mountains for 70 years and never seen
[23:59] god
[24:00] but you sent a prophet by his way amen
[24:02] and lord just through that little bit of
[24:04] time he spent with that prophet
[24:06] he showed god and that man died praising
[24:09] the lord
[24:11] and father we just thank you for these
[24:12] things father we thank you for
[24:14] the words of a prophet lord that we can
[24:17] go back and listen to father and rejoice
[24:20] over those things that he has said so
[24:22] many years ago
[24:23] but lord it's current for this day it's
[24:26] not words of a bygone day
[24:29] and father now we just asked the
[24:31] lord as we
[24:33] prepare ourselves to hear your word
[24:36] father
[24:37] that you give us
[24:38] ears to hear eyes to see but most of all
[24:41] heart to receive what is being said
[24:44] bless the the man of god that stands
[24:46] behind this pulpit lord and may you
[24:48] speak through him may we not just hear a
[24:51] man
[24:52] but lord may we hear from you father
[24:55] because if we don't do that
[24:58] our gathering here is in vain
[25:02] and we just wasted our time
[25:04] but father we know that or two or three
[25:07] are gathered together that you you'll
[25:09] meet us there because your word said
[25:10] that father we'll just commit this
[25:12] service into your hands for your glory
[25:15] your honor and let us our hearts burn
[25:18] within us father as you speak to us
[25:20] along the way
[25:21] in jesus name we pray amen
[25:29] amen we we have um special tonight from
[25:32] um our sisters man
[25:36] amen it's it's a special request for me
[25:39] amen
[25:40] i have two special requests tonight one
[25:43] from the sisters one from robert amen
[25:45] don't worry about time you you're good
[25:47] with time man
[25:48] amen
[25:49] so invite our sisters
[25:52] to come up amen
[25:59] [Music]
[26:12] so
[26:19] [Music]
[26:29] god bless you saints
[26:32] as brother greg just ended that prayer
[26:34] and said let our hearts burn within us
[26:37] right before he said those words my
[26:39] heart started to burn
[26:42] for his very short short testimony i
[26:44] don't know if you all know but i'm on
[26:45] our way down to florida
[26:48] we were in a very bad accident but no
[26:51] one was harmed
[26:52] car was totaled
[26:54] it was a one of the scariest experience
[26:56] i've ever had in my life in a vehicle
[26:59] but all i can do is call on the name of
[27:01] jesus like i've heard so many people do
[27:04] before
[27:05] and as i thought that this song was
[27:07] requested by brother seth
[27:08] and it says that
[27:11] we could just believe on his name
[27:14] and
[27:15] i thought it was very significant
[27:17] because that's all i can think to do
[27:20] and i believe he heard the cry and i
[27:22] believe he
[27:24] moved everything out the way so none of
[27:25] us would be injured
[27:27] including the children and everything
[27:29] like that nobody went to the hospital it
[27:30] was a quick transaction we had family
[27:32] close by
[27:33] and by great god's grace we are standing
[27:35] here today only by his grace i just want
[27:37] to say thank you i understand how
[27:39] precious life actually is and so this
[27:41] song will sing for the glory of god
[27:42] tonight i pray will be a blessing and if
[27:44] you know it sing along with us
[27:50] you
[27:51] say
[27:53] [Music]
[27:54] i
[27:55] believe

[42:40] 250 princes of the assembly
[42:44] the church is split right here
[42:46] famous in the congregation it's not
[42:48] going to happen in this church
[42:51] it would never happen here
[42:53] by the grace of god
[42:56] i don't want that to go back where it's
[42:58] pushing if we go back
[43:00] and happen on the one sending it
[43:06] go read the psalm
[43:08] famous in the congregation
[43:10] man of renown
[43:13] and they gather themselves together
[43:15] against
[43:17] and against
[43:19] make sense now
[43:21] so they were not just against moses
[43:24] they were against moses the prophet
[43:27] and against aaron
[43:30] which hold the priesthood
[43:32] amen why are they against
[43:35] and say unto them moses and aaron
[43:39] he take too much upon you
[43:43] you and your brother
[43:46] you think that you are above all the
[43:49] people in this planet earth
[43:54] that if nobody accept or believe you
[43:57] moses
[43:58] or be part of aaron
[44:01] then he's not a christian
[44:04] [Music]
[44:06] we all believe jesus christ
[44:09] we all preach the gospel
[44:11] we all carry the same bible why do you
[44:13] take too much you message believers
[44:18] why do you think we have to be in the
[44:19] message
[44:24] you you might be seated before i take
[44:26] something
[44:28] just a few i'm going to cut it short so
[44:30] they go
[44:31] so somebody will be meditating amen
[44:34] he said you take too much upon you
[44:37] seeing all the congregation are what
[44:40] [Music]
[44:42] did all of them
[44:43] get in the promised land
[44:45] jesus said they were all dead
[44:50] anybody here
[44:51] so they thought moses and aaron
[44:54] are arrogant
[44:57] they put themselves above everybody
[45:03] you see how they say that we message
[45:05] believer things we talk
[45:09] we didn't put ourselves there
[45:12] esther never chose that room
[45:15] he was chosen for her
[45:17] by grace
[45:18] she never came into the palace and said
[45:20] i want to be in a room so and so no
[45:23] the person who saw her just pick her up
[45:26] and say you go over there
[45:30] then we got in trouble with somebody
[45:32] that okay we think you think because you
[45:34] got in that room you above everybody i
[45:36] didn't say anything
[45:38] amen
[45:39] he said seeing all the congregation are
[45:42] holy
[45:43] every one of them in other words
[45:45] everybody is holy it's not just you
[45:48] and the lord is among them
[45:50] we also have miracles
[45:53] we speak in tongues
[45:54] we go to church we sing why do you think
[45:57] you are the only one that jesus will
[45:58] come and pick
[46:02] you the only one going to the rapture
[46:06] do you know the difference of age
[46:07] between moses and aaron
[46:11] okay let me continue amen
[46:13] wherefore then lift up yourself above
[46:17] the congregation of the lord
[46:20] everybody
[46:22] they thought
[46:23] that
[46:24] moses and aaron are lifting themselves
[46:27] up against above the congregation job
[46:30] two verse
[46:33] eight
[46:34] and moses said unto korra
[46:37] here i pray you ye sons of liver because
[46:39] they were liver too
[46:41] symmeted by the small things unto you
[46:44] that god that the god of israel has
[46:47] separated you from the congregation of
[46:50] israel to bring you near to himself to
[46:53] do the service of the tabernacle of the
[46:55] lord and to stand before the
[46:57] congregation to minister unto them
[46:59] and he has brought the near to him and
[47:02] all that brethren the sons of liver with
[47:04] thee and seek ye the priesthood also
[47:08] they already brought you closer
[47:10] but you are jealous
[47:12] about the position of aaron
[47:14] who holds the priesthood
[47:16] and moses who is the prophet
[47:19] everybody here
[47:20] let's see what happened you saw what
[47:22] happened here amen
[47:24] now

[47:34] you there
[47:35] and the lord speak unto moses saying you
[47:38] see the murmur
[47:40] you see what happened right

[47:45] saying
[47:46] speak unto the children of israel
[47:49] and take
[47:51] every one of them a road

[47:56] and all their princes according to the
[47:57] house of their father 12 roads
[48:00] write that every man's name upon his
[48:02] road
[48:03] and that shall write aaron's name
[48:06] upon the road of who
[48:09] for one road shall be for the head of
[48:11] the house of their father
[48:13] and that shall lay them up in the
[48:16] tabernacle of the congregation before
[48:19] the testimony where i will meet with you
[48:23] amen amen and it shall come to pass
[48:27] that the man's road
[48:30] whom i shall choose
[48:32] shall do what
[48:36] it's a choosing of the lord
[48:39] amen
[48:40] shall blossom
[48:42] and i will make to cease
[48:46] from me the murmurings
[48:50] of the children of
[48:52] israel
[48:53] whereby
[48:55] the murmur against me
[48:59] against moses and who
[49:02] so the road
[49:04] blossoming
[49:06] is god
[49:07] shedding the mouth of somebody
[49:10] amen
[49:11] amen
[49:14] everybody okay
[49:15] everybody okay so if there are people
[49:17] that gossip about you
[49:20] and they talk about you
[49:22] and they say things about you don't
[49:24] worry about it
[49:26] just blossom
[49:29] amen the more you blossom
[49:32] and the more you are producing fruit
[49:36] somebody is zipping
[49:38] somebody else's mouth
[49:41] everybody here
[49:42] keep this in mind since you know the
[49:44] background now
[49:46] now on sunday you will see lords willing
[49:48] what happened amen
[49:50] but remember when you coming up nobody
[49:52] understood the golden candlestick why
[49:55] they were almond with fruit
[49:57] it took the road of aaron
[49:59] to unveil the secret that for you to be
[50:03] what you see here you must be into the
[50:06] holiest when you enter into the holiest
[50:08] then you're gonna bad
[50:10] and then you're gonna blossom you're
[50:12] gonna have a flower then you will have
[50:14] fruit and on top of that candlestick
[50:17] there was a fire
[50:20] did you remember that
[50:22] there was a burden there is a blossoming
[50:24] there is a fruit and a fire
[50:26] amen
[50:27] and that fire is the fire of the holy
[50:30] spirit
[50:31] that's why on the day of pentecost
[50:35] amen when the pillar of fire came he
[50:38] broke himself down in later amen
[50:41] entering into
[50:43] bringing the fire of god in the road
[50:46] and then the apostle which were road
[50:49] begin to
[50:50] blossom bad and produce fruit because
[50:53] there was a fire waiting right there
[50:56] it's for every single age it's written
[50:58] right there and it was locked into the
[51:01] candlestick amen
[51:03] so keep it in prayer and keep thinking
[51:05] about it god does it to block somebody's
[51:09] mouth
[51:10] amen
[51:11] matter of fact job to verse
[51:15] job to verse

[51:33] and the lord say unto moses bring
[51:36] aaron's road
[51:38] again
[51:39] before the testimony
[51:41] to be kept for what
[51:44] against the
[51:46] so you become a token
[51:49] against somebody who rebel
[51:52] against the rebel and that shall quite
[51:56] take away the murmurings
[51:59] from me
[52:00] that they die
[52:03] so when a road blossomed
[52:06] that's why you heard about the bottom
[52:07] say that's the thunder
[52:09] that is shaking the enemy
[52:11] amen it's when a life is produced
[52:15] from the tabernacle
[52:16] that say you don't have to talk
[52:18] you just move in
[52:20] and the life itself is speaking louder
[52:23] than even you're talking amen

[57:07] so just see me as a musician amen and
[57:10] let the lord speak to you tonight amen
[57:12] amen
[57:14] amen we want to open our scripture to uh
[57:17] the book of proverbs
[57:19] proverbs
[57:21] 25
[57:24] amen
[57:30] proverbs 25
[57:32] verses 2 and 3
[57:35] and he said it is the glory of god
[57:38] to conceal a thing
[57:41] but
[57:42] the honor of kings is to search out a
[57:45] mother
[57:46] can we be seated amen
[57:48] amen
[57:49] amen
[57:50] it is the glory of the lord to hide it
[57:54] from any other person
[57:57] but when he has called us as kings
[58:00] it is his obligation to open up his word
[58:03] to us
[58:05] in other words there's no secret that
[58:07] the lord will hide from his bride
[58:10] [Music]
[58:11] he said the heaven for heights and the
[58:13] earth for death
[58:16] and the heart of kings is on such a way
[58:18] man i came tonight
[58:21] the lord has called us
[58:23] kings and priests amen
[58:25] so we are kings tonight
[58:27] and we are going to talk our skins amen
[58:30] amen we are going to talk as a bride of
[58:33] christ amen
[58:34] don't worry about time i mean
[58:36] i i'm a man with a few words to me
[58:40] i'm not going to keep you alone you man
[58:42] amen
[58:43] amen but when you try to sleep
[58:46] tonight
[58:47] by the time you you hear me talk amen we
[58:50] are closed amen
[58:52] so don't even try sleeping man
[58:54] i'm just going to be short amen
[58:57] amen
[58:58] let's go to the book of ecclesiastes
[59:01] event
[59:04] amen
[59:07] just close your eyes and you hear me say
[59:09] amen we are closed amen
[59:12] ecclesiastes chapter 3
[59:14] verse 14 and 15.
[59:18] said i know that whatsoever god do with
[59:21] it shall be forever
[59:24] nothing can be put to it
[59:26] nor anything taken from it
[59:29] and god do what it that men should fear
[59:32] before him
[59:33] now 15 said that which had been
[59:37] is now
[59:38] and not which is to be
[59:41] have already been
[59:43] and god required that which is past
[59:47] in other words we are talking about
[59:49] jesus christ the same yesterday today
[59:51] and forever the prophet said god is not
[59:54] doing anything new today he's just
[59:57] repeating himself
[1:00:00] so whatever the lord has promised
[1:00:03] he's already seen it in the past
[1:00:07] whatever he said that
[1:00:10] my my child or my son my daughter this
[1:00:13] and this and that he's already done it
[1:00:15] in the past
[1:00:16] it is something that he's just repeating
[1:00:19] amen so it is it's just a word that
[1:00:24] i i just want us to look at tonight amen
[1:00:27] but that that is not
[1:00:29] our theme for tonight
[1:00:35] our thing for tonight is a bryce jubilee
[1:00:38] that is
[1:00:40] um
[1:00:43] in fact um last last week tuesday i
[1:00:47] i woke up from a dream and then
[1:00:49] the lord gave me a song
[1:00:52] and the song was about jubilee
[1:00:55] and then when
[1:00:56] when i woke up i could just remember um
[1:00:59] just one line
[1:01:01] of the song
[1:01:03] so when when i got up the lord started
[1:01:06] giving me inspiration i mean and and we
[1:01:08] thank god for this ministry amen that
[1:01:11] the lord keeps opening our understanding
[1:01:14] to his word
[1:01:16] so
[1:01:17] um the words just started coming and
[1:01:19] coming and coming and
[1:01:21] um we try to put something together amen
[1:01:25] at the end of of this preaching we're
[1:01:28] going to look at the song amen
[1:01:30] amen
[1:01:31] don't worry i'm a musician man we are
[1:01:33] going to do so many songs tonight amen
[1:01:36] amen amen
[1:01:39] so we are looking at the bright jubilee
[1:01:42] amen so let's go to the book of
[1:01:44] leviticus amen
[1:01:46] leviticus 25.
[1:01:48] it's so amazing the
[1:01:50] russian read from the book of leviticus
[1:01:53] event
[1:01:54] leviticus 25
[1:02:00] will take from verse 1 to 13 amen
[1:02:05] and i'm just going to uh touch the
[1:02:08] surface because i know there's more in
[1:02:10] store
[1:02:11] in in in the tub knuckle for us man that
[1:02:14] the lord is opening up amen i'm just
[1:02:17] going to brush through the surface i
[1:02:18] know the lord is going to open so much
[1:02:20] amen i was telling my wife that if if
[1:02:24] we talk about one nugget bruh stephen
[1:02:26] can just or the lord can open
[1:02:29] in bruh stephen about 50 to 100 nuggets
[1:02:33] amen amen so we are just going to brush
[1:02:36] the surface amen
[1:02:39] conversation i said and the lord spoke
[1:02:41] onto moses
[1:02:43] in mount sinai
[1:02:46] one person
[1:02:48] in the mountain
[1:02:50] the word came to one person
[1:02:53] the prophet
[1:02:56] you have to believe him
[1:02:59] to understand his
[1:03:00] word amen
[1:03:03] one person
[1:03:05] in the mountain
[1:03:06] saying
[1:03:08] speak unto the children of israel
[1:03:11] it was specific to a people
[1:03:14] so the word of the lord came to one
[1:03:15] person going to a specific people
[1:03:19] he didn't say all the world or everybody
[1:03:21] in the world he said specific to the
[1:03:24] children of israel
[1:03:26] so when the lord sent a word to the
[1:03:28] prophet it is going to go out of the
[1:03:31] caliber of the prophet that is those who
[1:03:34] believe the prophet's message
[1:03:36] so i don't care where
[1:03:39] whatever you are hearing outside of this
[1:03:41] message
[1:03:42] the the message is to those who believe
[1:03:44] the message
[1:03:46] so when you're coming against the
[1:03:48] message
[1:03:49] don't forget that the message is for
[1:03:51] them that believe the message
[1:03:53] the word of the lord came to moses for
[1:03:55] the children of israel
[1:04:00] speak unto the children of israel
[1:04:03] and say unto them
[1:04:05] when you come into the land which i give
[1:04:08] you
[1:04:09] so the lord knows that there was a land
[1:04:12] that was prepared for them
[1:04:14] he said when
[1:04:15] he didn't say if
[1:04:17] he said when
[1:04:19] there was an assurance
[1:04:21] that the lord said when you come to the
[1:04:23] land that i give you
[1:04:25] when the lord has given us promises
[1:04:28] there is an assurance
[1:04:30] that the lord is going to accomplish
[1:04:32] every promise
[1:04:33] he said i am your healer
[1:04:36] come to me
[1:04:38] that i have learned amen and i shall
[1:04:41] give you rest
[1:04:42] hallelujah
[1:04:48] speak unto the children of israel and
[1:04:50] say unto them when you come into the
[1:04:52] land which i give you
[1:04:54] then shall the land keep a sabbath unto
[1:04:57] the lord
[1:04:58] amen
[1:04:59] amen
[1:05:01] amen
[1:05:04] now i i
[1:05:06] i just want to say something when the
[1:05:08] lord gives
[1:05:10] a command
[1:05:12] or the lord says something there is an
[1:05:13] expectation
[1:05:15] there is an expectation of a result
[1:05:19] so
[1:05:20] let's just let's just give a scenario
[1:05:23] that maybe uh
[1:05:25] i asked my brother here
[1:05:27] and i asked him to get into my car and
[1:05:30] and
[1:05:31] and i give him my keys
[1:05:33] go to
[1:05:34] my house and pick up a book or pick up a
[1:05:38] bible for me amen
[1:05:41] i know exactly what i'm talking about so
[1:05:44] when my brother is coming back i'm
[1:05:46] expecting to see that book
[1:05:49] because i know there is a book in the
[1:05:51] house
[1:05:53] so when the lord is giving a promise he
[1:05:55] knows that there is something there for
[1:05:57] you
[1:05:58] and when you are coming back his right
[1:06:01] is not coming back without the result
[1:06:07] it's not coming forward amen
[1:06:09] it's coming with that result amen
[1:06:13] so when the lord has promised us healing
[1:06:16] hallelujah
[1:06:17] it doesn't care how long it's going to
[1:06:19] take it is the word of the lord
[1:06:22] amen and amen
[1:06:24] i believe that tonight do you believe it
[1:06:27] amen amen
[1:06:29] amen
[1:06:30] he said six years thou shalt sow that
[1:06:32] field
[1:06:34] six years
[1:06:36] thou shalt prune thy vineyard a vineyard
[1:06:40] and gather in the fruit thereof
[1:06:42] so the lord is saying for six years you
[1:06:46] go into labor amen
[1:06:48] six years going to labor
[1:06:51] amen
[1:06:55] said but in the seventh year
[1:06:58] shall be a sabbath of rest
[1:07:01] now when i see this but
[1:07:03] it just points me to revelation 10 7.
[1:07:07] it's a but
[1:07:09] in the dress
[1:07:10] of the voice
[1:07:12] of the servant
[1:07:16] hallelujah
[1:07:17] so but in the seventh year shall be a
[1:07:21] sabbath of rest unto the land
[1:07:24] a sabbath for the lord thou shalt
[1:07:27] neither show
[1:07:29] that filth
[1:07:30] nor prune that vine yet
[1:07:32] now when we are showing something it
[1:07:35] means we are adding onto
[1:07:37] we are taking a seat
[1:07:39] and we are adding on to
[1:07:41] when we are pruning
[1:07:43] we are taking something out
[1:07:46] right
[1:07:48] but they say in this seventh
[1:07:50] there is no addition
[1:07:52] there's no subtraction why because it's
[1:07:54] a complete
[1:07:56] now when you think
[1:07:58] hallelujah
[1:07:59] it is accomplishing amen
[1:08:02] so when the seventh word comes to us
[1:08:05] it is a complete and a full word to us
[1:08:09] there's no addition there's no
[1:08:10] subtraction
[1:08:13] hallelujah
[1:08:16] from the first to the sixth
[1:08:18] the lord permitted
[1:08:20] some craps
[1:08:22] amen
[1:08:24] amen some addiction some subtractions
[1:08:27] but when you go to the seven
[1:08:29] we don't touch it amen hallelujah
[1:08:33] hallelujah
[1:08:34] amen
[1:08:36] as i said i'm just brushing it evenly
[1:08:38] amen a little bit
[1:08:41] he said that which growth of his own
[1:08:44] accord of thy harvest
[1:08:46] that shall not reap
[1:08:49] so we are not doing any touching here we
[1:08:51] are not reaping
[1:08:53] neither gather the grapes of thy
[1:08:55] vineyard
[1:08:57] of that vine undressed
[1:08:59] we are not gathering we are not reaping
[1:09:01] we are not doing anything to it is that
[1:09:03] for it is a year of rest
[1:09:06] unto the lord
[1:09:08] now now there's no work amen
[1:09:11] we are not doing any work amen
[1:09:14] but but but look at verse six is that
[1:09:17] and the sabbath of the land shall be
[1:09:19] made for you
[1:09:21] we are not doing any work
[1:09:23] but there is eating amen
[1:09:25] there is food for us amen
[1:09:28] hallelujah
[1:09:30] amen amen
[1:09:32] amen and the sabbath of the land shall
[1:09:34] be made for you for thee
[1:09:36] and for that seven
[1:09:38] for thy mate
[1:09:39] and for die hard seven and for that
[1:09:42] stranger that sojournet with thee
[1:09:45] amen it is a sabbath
[1:09:48] that comes to everything that belongs to
[1:09:50] you
[1:09:52] hallelujah
[1:09:53] hallelujah sometimes we just we just
[1:09:55] want to get up and proclaim amen and
[1:09:58] claim every family member that is lost
[1:10:02] amen everything that is lost in our
[1:10:04] house we want to get up
[1:10:07] and claim it amen because when there is
[1:10:10] sabbath
[1:10:11] it affects everything that is you
[1:10:14] amen and amen when it is subbed amen
[1:10:18] when your head is aching
[1:10:21] it is also affected
[1:10:23] there is no headache it's claiming the
[1:10:25] whole land amen your whole body a man
[1:10:28] has been proclaimed has been claimed by
[1:10:31] the lord
[1:10:32] amen and amen
[1:10:34] amen
[1:10:36] and for thy cattle and for the beasts
[1:10:38] that are in the land
[1:10:40] shall all the increase thereof be meat
[1:10:43] hallelujah
[1:10:45] and those are number seven sabbats
[1:10:48] now this is where we are getting to him
[1:10:50] and that's just number seven sabbah of
[1:10:53] years on today
[1:10:55] seven times seven years
[1:10:58] and the space of the seventh sabbath of
[1:11:01] years shall be on to the forty and nine
[1:11:04] years
[1:11:05] so we are looking at seven sabbats seven
[1:11:08] years seven times seven give us forty
[1:11:10] nine amen
[1:11:13] he said
[1:11:14] that shadow caused the trumpet
[1:11:19] of the jubilee to sound
[1:11:22] now it is a specific
[1:11:25] sounding
[1:11:27] of the trumpet it is not any sound
[1:11:30] it is a son of jubilee
[1:11:33] then shall that cross the trumpet of the
[1:11:35] jubilee to sound on the 10th day
[1:11:39] of the seventh month
[1:11:41] when we see this 10th seven amen
[1:11:44] it does something to our marrow amen
[1:11:47] hallelujah
[1:11:49] hallelujah i believe you understand what
[1:11:50] i'm talking about amen
[1:11:52] we we have our pastor amen that that
[1:11:55] always opens up this word to us amen
[1:11:58] 107 amen
[1:12:00] amen
[1:12:03] then shall cross the trumpet of the
[1:12:05] jubilee to sound on the tenth day of the
[1:12:07] seventh month in the day of atonement
[1:12:09] shall you shall you make the trumpet
[1:12:11] sound throughout all your land and you
[1:12:14] shall hallow the 50th year
[1:12:16] and proclaim liberty amen throughout all
[1:12:20] the land unto all the inhabitants
[1:12:22] thereof
[1:12:23] it shall be a jubilee unto you
[1:12:26] and you shall return every man unto his
[1:12:31] underlined
[1:12:32] his possession
[1:12:35] his possession amen and he shall return
[1:12:38] every man unto his family
[1:12:41] and jubilee shall that fiftieth year be
[1:12:43] unto you
[1:12:45] you shall not sow
[1:12:47] neither reap that which growth of itself
[1:12:50] in it no gather the grapes in it of
[1:12:53] divine
[1:12:54] undress amen so we see that jubilee is
[1:12:57] also doing the same thing as the sabbah
[1:13:00] hallelujah
[1:13:02] amen so i i just look at it the jubilee
[1:13:05] is the mega sabbath
[1:13:08] hallelujah
[1:13:11] hallelujah
[1:13:12] the mega rest for the bride
[1:13:15] amen
[1:13:17] for now
[1:13:18] for it is the jubilee it shall be holy
[1:13:21] unto you
[1:13:22] you shall eat the increase thereof out
[1:13:24] of the field
[1:13:26] in the year of this jubilee ye shall
[1:13:29] return every man unto his possession
[1:13:34] hallelujah
[1:13:38] we can we can't read the scripture
[1:13:40] without the interpretation of the
[1:13:42] scripture
[1:13:44] i believe you understand what i'm
[1:13:46] talking about
[1:13:47] we have a voice of interpretation in
[1:13:49] this last days
[1:13:51] and and if if you're still struggling
[1:13:54] while we read from the prophet amen
[1:13:56] the pastor is there amen he's a medical
[1:13:58] doctor we can just organize an ambulance
[1:14:01] to
[1:14:01] his his hospital amen
[1:14:04] amen you can just go see him
[1:14:06] it's an emergency man if you're still
[1:14:09] struggling to see why you read from the
[1:14:11] prophet
[1:14:12] that is the vindicated voice in this
[1:14:14] last day the voice of the lord almighty
[1:14:17] himself amen
[1:14:19] amen
[1:14:20] amen
[1:14:22] amen
[1:14:24] so what we want to take
[1:14:27] from the prophet
[1:14:29] amen
[1:14:32] amen
[1:14:34] i want to try to
[1:14:35] to hurry up with it amen
[1:14:38] amen
[1:14:43] amen
[1:14:47] so now the prophet said something here
[1:14:49] he said
[1:14:50] now
[1:14:51] now the pentecostal people have stopped
[1:14:54] now i'll be probably get plenty back on
[1:14:57] this
[1:14:58] that this coming from the message uh
[1:15:00] it's question and answers in um 54.
[1:15:06] is that now the pentecostal people have
[1:15:08] stopped
[1:15:09] now i'll probably get plenty back on
[1:15:11] this
[1:15:12] but i must be honest
[1:15:14] if i've got to come to the world
[1:15:17] there is no such a thing as staring
[1:15:20] meeting
[1:15:22] you've been in error
[1:15:24] terry doesn't mean pray
[1:15:26] he said terry means wait
[1:15:30] after the ascension
[1:15:32] after jesus christ the crucifixion
[1:15:35] the cleansing of the sanctuary amen and
[1:15:37] after the day of the atonement the
[1:15:39] resurrection the day of the atonement
[1:15:41] when he was killed
[1:15:42] and then it's 40 days until the
[1:15:44] ascension and then pentacles what we are
[1:15:47] trying to look at here is
[1:15:49] jubilee is pentecost which is the
[1:15:52] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:15:55] hallelujah
[1:15:57] amen is that a day of the atonement when
[1:15:59] he was killed and then it's 40 days
[1:16:02] until the ascension and then pentecost
[1:16:04] the word pentecost means 50.
[1:16:09] amen
[1:16:10] the word pentecost means 50. it meant 50
[1:16:13] days after offering of the atonement
[1:16:16] amen
[1:16:17] and then after the atonement was offered
[1:16:19] everything had to come out perfect
[1:16:22] laterally geographically everything just
[1:16:25] as god said
[1:16:27] and pentecost it was a jubilee time
[1:16:30] and they brought the first fruits of the
[1:16:33] harvest
[1:16:35] and had a jubilee
[1:16:37] they brought first fruits
[1:16:40] so when we are talking about jubilee
[1:16:43] there is something called first fruits
[1:16:46] so when the bread is having a jubilee
[1:16:48] there must be first fruits
[1:16:52] and in the bible first fruits what did
[1:16:54] they do with the first fruits it was a
[1:16:56] wave offering
[1:16:57] to show an example to the people
[1:17:02] hallelujah
[1:17:03] amen
[1:17:06] amen
[1:17:07] amen
[1:17:09] amen
[1:17:10] amen
[1:17:12] pentecost it was a jubilee time when
[1:17:14] they brought the first fruit of the
[1:17:15] harvest
[1:17:16] in and had a jubilee now the first
[1:17:19] fruits of the church
[1:17:21] the holy ghost church
[1:17:23] the check that was to last these two
[1:17:26] thousand years till jesus come
[1:17:28] the first fruit come at pentecost
[1:17:31] and it was 40 days after the cleansing
[1:17:34] after the killing of the sacrifice onto
[1:17:37] the ascension of jesus christ he said go
[1:17:39] up to jerusalem and wait
[1:17:42] unto your endute with power from one
[1:17:45] high
[1:17:46] amen
[1:17:47] so we are looking at the baptism of the
[1:17:49] holy ghost
[1:17:51] as the jubilee
[1:17:53] amen or pentecost as jubilee and is
[1:17:56] marked by what first fruits
[1:17:59] amen
[1:18:00] amen
[1:18:02] now i want to take this message amen
[1:18:04] amen i have i have no message for you
[1:18:06] man we are under a voice amen so
[1:18:09] whatever the voice is saying is what we
[1:18:11] believe
[1:18:13] hallelujah amen
[1:18:15] amen
[1:18:17] this is coming from the message the 70th
[1:18:19] week of daniel amen
[1:18:21] amen
[1:18:23] he said a striking statement from the
[1:18:26] time god made the promise to abraham
[1:18:29] don't miss this
[1:18:30] from the time god made the promise to
[1:18:32] abraham that's genesis 2 3
[1:18:35] to the time of christ being rejected i
[1:18:38] believe brazilian is going to explain
[1:18:40] this to us more amen to the time of of
[1:18:44] christ being rejected in 1833 by the
[1:18:47] jews according to galatians 3 16 and 17
[1:18:51] and according to ashes chronology of the
[1:18:55] hebrews the power of god was with the
[1:18:58] jews
[1:18:59] exactly
[1:19:01] 1954 years
[1:19:04] god dealt with the jews
[1:19:06] 1954 years according to the chronology
[1:19:09] of the jews and according to the
[1:19:11] gentiles
[1:19:12] and according to galatians 3 16 and 17
[1:19:16] i've got many more scriptures
[1:19:18] but just give that
[1:19:20] then after they rejected christ he
[1:19:23] turned to the gentiles
[1:19:25] to take a people for his name
[1:19:28] you want a scripture on that is that
[1:19:30] that he said acts 15 14. said not
[1:19:33] counting the time we find that we have
[1:19:36] exactly
[1:19:38] listen 17 years left
[1:19:41] and we will have the same span of time
[1:19:44] given to us
[1:19:45] as god dealing with us in the power of
[1:19:48] the holy spirit since 1833 until
[1:19:53] 1977. so he he was speaking
[1:19:57] this in 1961 amen and was talking about
[1:20:00] 17 years left amen so the same span of
[1:20:03] time of
[1:20:04] 1954 years
[1:20:06] god deals with us the same as he did
[1:20:09] with the jews
[1:20:10] how about that
[1:20:12] now mark down in your book a little
[1:20:15] scripture here i want to give you which
[1:20:17] we read leviticus 25
[1:20:19] it said beginning with the eighth verse
[1:20:21] is that god called a jubilee
[1:20:23] every
[1:20:24] 49th year
[1:20:26] the 50th year was the jubilee
[1:20:30] we know that amen we understand that
[1:20:33] amen and we're ready from the scripture
[1:20:35] amen
[1:20:36] amen from the first jubilee of livik
[1:20:39] leviticus 25 8
[1:20:42] in 1977 will be the 70th jubilee making
[1:20:46] exactly
[1:20:48] 3430 years
[1:20:50] jubilee means the growing up
[1:20:53] the release
[1:20:55] oh we are watching for the coming of
[1:20:57] that glad millennium day amen
[1:21:00] when our blessed lord shall come and
[1:21:02] catch his wedding bride away
[1:21:05] all the world the world is groaning
[1:21:08] crying for that day of sweet release
[1:21:11] when our savior shall come back to earth
[1:21:13] again
[1:21:15] say did you get that
[1:21:17] so god has dealt with us exactly the
[1:21:20] same amount of time that he dealt with
[1:21:22] the jews from the time he gave abraham
[1:21:25] the promise unto the rejection of the
[1:21:27] messiah in 1833 was
[1:21:31] 1954 years
[1:21:33] and now we have 17 years left we had
[1:21:35] about
[1:21:36] 1930-something years we got 17 years
[1:21:40] left until 77
[1:21:41] will be the 70th jubilee since the
[1:21:44] beginning of jubilees
[1:21:49] so 1977 marked something 70 in the life
[1:21:53] of the bride amen and what will it be oh
[1:21:57] brother watch close now don't miss it it
[1:22:00] will be the jubilee of the growing up of
[1:22:02] the gentile bright
[1:22:04] and the return of christ to the jew
[1:22:06] when they go out of bondage amen don't
[1:22:09] you see from all the world they've
[1:22:11] gathered there for that day oh my
[1:22:13] see where we are at we don't
[1:22:16] we don't know what time it might happen
[1:22:18] we are at the end time amen the prophet
[1:22:21] said we are at the end time so now
[1:22:23] listen to you old timers here in the
[1:22:26] church that's been here for a long time
[1:22:28] i want you to notice something i never
[1:22:31] learned this until yesterday i picked it
[1:22:33] up from historian poor boyd
[1:22:36] and then i've and then i've traced it
[1:22:39] back to the scriptures
[1:22:41] picked up these
[1:22:42] other dates here and so forth and got it
[1:22:46] and run it trust it true
[1:22:48] amen amen so the prophet is making us to
[1:22:52] understand
[1:22:54] that we are in the 70 of
[1:22:58] jubilee when jubilee started amen
[1:23:02] amen
[1:23:03] and 70 means something to us amen
[1:23:07] hallelujah
[1:23:08] amen
[1:23:11] now i
[1:23:14] amen
[1:23:17] the first said something
[1:23:19] that i just want us to um to talk about
[1:23:22] even if you are not able to finish it
[1:23:24] man said
[1:23:26] and i took a note from it said jubilee
[1:23:29] is preceded by trials and temptations
[1:23:33] amen if
[1:23:37] amen
[1:23:41] i have permission from the pastor amen
[1:23:44] amen
[1:23:50] now
[1:23:52] the prophet is saying something
[1:23:54] that this
[1:23:56] number 40 means trials and temptations
[1:24:02] amen
[1:24:04] i don't know if i want to read a quote
[1:24:07] but
[1:24:12] amen
[1:24:13] forgive me amen
[1:24:20] amen
[1:24:21] from the message spiritual adoption amen
[1:24:23] preached in 1916 1956 he said the
[1:24:26] prophet said 50 is his number of jubilee
[1:24:30] 40 is his number of temptation
[1:24:34] he met
[1:24:35] amen and and and when i was looking at
[1:24:38] this number amen
[1:24:41] for the means
[1:24:42] temptation amen
[1:24:45] now 40 comes before 50.
[1:24:51] so there is something so hard here
[1:24:54] that we have to go through
[1:24:56] before we start shouting here
[1:25:00] amen
[1:25:02] and you know you know
[1:25:03] the uh
[1:25:05] the israelites
[1:25:07] were in the wilderness for how many
[1:25:09] years
[1:25:10] 40 years
[1:25:12] they were being tried and tempted
[1:25:15] and and we understand to the preaching
[1:25:19] amen
[1:25:21] that
[1:25:21] before you go to the holiest
[1:25:26] you must be proven
[1:25:28] that you really
[1:25:30] are a child of god
[1:25:32] amen
[1:25:33] and and and and this 40 that
[1:25:36] we see here is trying our faith to see
[1:25:40] if we really
[1:25:42] believe
[1:25:43] what we said from the beginning
[1:25:47] amen
[1:25:48] amen
[1:25:49] but one very interesting thing about
[1:25:51] this 40 is that
[1:25:53] there is this number four
[1:25:58] amen
[1:25:59] so if i break it into two women i have
[1:26:01] four and zero
[1:26:03] so even though we are going through our
[1:26:05] trials amen
[1:26:07] god is telling us
[1:26:09] of
[1:26:10] deliverance
[1:26:14] hallelujah
[1:26:18] and when you add this to it it is
[1:26:21] an eternal deliverance
[1:26:27] amen
[1:26:28] this word is speaking to me
[1:26:31] amen
[1:26:32] we go to our trials we go through our
[1:26:34] temptations but the lord is telling us
[1:26:38] that there is a deliverance
[1:26:41] and it is an eternal deliverance
[1:26:44] it doesn't matter how long it's going to
[1:26:46] take
[1:26:48] therefore is telling us there is a
[1:26:50] deliverance
[1:26:52] amen
[1:26:53] so
[1:26:54] before we get here
[1:26:56] we have to go through this
[1:26:59] and then there comes
[1:27:02] 50 which is jubilee
[1:27:04] and the prophet said
[1:27:06] jubilee
[1:27:08] is
[1:27:10] i want to read
[1:27:13] amen
[1:27:15] amen
[1:27:16] as brad stephen said the bible said but
[1:27:19] abraham said amen
[1:27:21] amen it is not but a stephen said or
[1:27:24] whoever stands here said amen we want to
[1:27:27] read from the prophet
[1:27:29] hallelujah
[1:27:37] amen
[1:27:41] hallelujah
[1:27:52] amen and amen amen
[1:27:56] now this is from the message
[1:28:03] from the message go tell
[1:28:05] preach in sixth 1960 amen
[1:28:08] paragraph reading from paragraph 87 said
[1:28:11] in the bible time there was a jubilee
[1:28:14] year come
[1:28:16] people that were sold out for debts
[1:28:19] that they owed
[1:28:21] they owed a debt and
[1:28:24] they could not pay it
[1:28:26] so they went and sold themselves to
[1:28:29] people
[1:28:30] for slaves
[1:28:32] so they were owing people they couldn't
[1:28:34] pay so they went to um sell themselves
[1:28:36] to people for slaves so they had to beat
[1:28:39] their slave
[1:28:41] they are born slaves
[1:28:43] all their life
[1:28:45] but
[1:28:46] every so often there come a day of grace
[1:28:50] what was known as jubilee year
[1:28:54] so the prophet is saying that jubilee
[1:28:58] is also the day of grace
[1:29:03] and
[1:29:04] as we know
[1:29:06] god works in numbers
[1:29:08] amen so when i'm seeing jubilee i'm
[1:29:11] seeing grace
[1:29:14] hallelujah
[1:29:17] eternal grace
[1:29:21] hallelujah
[1:29:23] so when the lord sells jubilee to the
[1:29:25] bride it is an eternal jubilee
[1:29:30] hallelujah
[1:29:32] amen
[1:29:35] i mean for for the sake of time amen
[1:29:39] we just want to take some scriptures
[1:29:44] amen
[1:29:48] i just want to take this
[1:29:50] one quote and then i read the scripture
[1:29:52] amen amen then i bring it to a close
[1:29:54] amen amen
[1:29:57] don't worry
[1:29:59] amen
[1:30:06] hallelujah
[1:30:07] all right
[1:30:08] this
[1:30:09] message this from return
[1:30:12] and jubilee preach in 1962
[1:30:16] he said s7 now remember
[1:30:19] a seven gets his reward or his wages
[1:30:23] but he was never to be free
[1:30:26] in the jubilee
[1:30:28] no sir
[1:30:30] a seven was not free in the jubilee that
[1:30:33] was not born an israelite
[1:30:35] [Music]
[1:30:38] so this servant that
[1:30:39] the prophet is talking about
[1:30:41] is the one that is not an israelite
[1:30:46] we are going to read from the scripture
[1:30:47] amen
[1:30:49] he had to be born in order to be free in
[1:30:52] the jubilee so before jubilee comes to
[1:30:55] you you must be an israelite
[1:31:00] before the bride's jubilee come to you
[1:31:02] you must be a bride
[1:31:04] that is why the message was going to the
[1:31:07] bride or the message was going to israel
[1:31:14] amen
[1:31:15] and many people get their rewards jesus
[1:31:17] said about the hypocrites said they have
[1:31:20] their rewards
[1:31:21] but you are different
[1:31:24] you and i we are different amen so yes
[1:31:27] that's what jesus was saying in john 8
[1:31:29] about the jews they said we are free he
[1:31:32] said the seven does not abide in the
[1:31:35] house
[1:31:36] but when he gave them bread
[1:31:39] they was no longer servant
[1:31:42] they were sons and joined us with him in
[1:31:46] the kingdom
[1:31:47] that's the way the church is
[1:31:49] is join us with christ in the kingdom
[1:31:53] as of all things to god through him
[1:31:56] now we find that the church moved off in
[1:31:59] the same direction that his forefathers
[1:32:02] moved in the first organizations of
[1:32:04] churches
[1:32:05] it's been that way down to the ages
[1:32:08] but they are never never the servants
[1:32:12] but they are never never their servants
[1:32:15] will not be free
[1:32:16] they will not hear the word
[1:32:19] they will not believe the word
[1:32:23] why because the word was not made for
[1:32:25] them the word was made for us
[1:32:28] so the servants they heard the trumpet
[1:32:31] sound
[1:32:32] that priest riding through the land
[1:32:35] sounding this trumpet that every man was
[1:32:38] free
[1:32:39] sounded out throughout liberty
[1:32:42] all out the land
[1:32:43] and every man that was born a jew know
[1:32:46] he could go back to his inheritance
[1:32:49] i don't care how far he was sold
[1:32:52] what happened he could go back because
[1:32:55] he was born in the house
[1:32:58] he was in his father's house
[1:33:00] born but the seven didn't know what he
[1:33:03] was doing
[1:33:05] oh my so both of them were working for
[1:33:08] the same master
[1:33:10] sword and the sin
[1:33:11] many a pentecostal tonight is so the
[1:33:14] same way
[1:33:15] amen
[1:33:16] so you have two types of servant amen
[1:33:19] working for the master
[1:33:21] when the jubilee is sounded
[1:33:23] one has the right to be free
[1:33:27] but the other does not have the right to
[1:33:29] go
[1:33:32] hallelujah
[1:33:34] amen we want to read um exodus 21 1-6
[1:33:46] exodus 21 1-6
[1:33:51] so now these are the judgments
[1:33:54] which thou shalt set before them
[1:33:58] if
[1:34:00] thou by an hebrew
[1:34:02] servant specific
[1:34:06] hebrew seventh
[1:34:08] and israelites amen
[1:34:10] six years he shall serve
[1:34:13] and in the seventh year he shall go out
[1:34:16] free
[1:34:17] for nothing
[1:34:20] amen
[1:34:22] if he came in by himself
[1:34:25] he shall go out by himself
[1:34:27] if he were married
[1:34:29] then his wife shall go out with him
[1:34:33] whatever possession he had that he
[1:34:35] brought in when the jubilee sounded he
[1:34:37] takes his possession back
[1:34:40] amen
[1:34:41] if his master has given him a wife
[1:34:45] and she have borne him sons and
[1:34:47] daughters
[1:34:48] their wife and her children shall be her
[1:34:51] masters
[1:34:52] he shall go out by himself
[1:34:55] because
[1:34:56] he is going back to his possession
[1:34:59] what he owned from the beginning
[1:35:02] amen he said and if the servant shall
[1:35:04] plainly say
[1:35:05] i love my master
[1:35:07] my wife and my children
[1:35:10] i will not go out free
[1:35:12] then this master shall bring him unto
[1:35:14] the judges
[1:35:16] he shall also bring him to the door
[1:35:19] or onto the doorpost and his master
[1:35:22] shall board his ear through with and all
[1:35:26] and he shall save him forever
[1:35:29] and we know um
[1:35:30] what that meant where they put the ear
[1:35:33] ring in in their ear
[1:35:35] showing that
[1:35:36] they are slaves to their master
[1:35:39] amen
[1:35:40] that when the sounding came they didn't
[1:35:42] hear any sound
[1:35:44] the sound does not apply to them
[1:35:48] [Music]
[1:35:51] amen
[1:35:52] amen
[1:35:54] hallelujah
[1:35:56] so we can see a lot of people
[1:35:59] who are still slaves to masters
[1:36:03] who are not free
[1:36:05] amen we we
[1:36:06] we do not judge people people judge
[1:36:09] themselves
[1:36:10] i told my wife that when somebody says
[1:36:12] why are you judging why are you judging
[1:36:14] me i'm like okay i am not judging you
[1:36:18] i'm just looking at you
[1:36:20] and describing who you are
[1:36:22] that is not the judgment
[1:36:24] you yourself have judged yourself
[1:36:29] amen
[1:36:30] amen
[1:36:32] amen
[1:36:34] amen
[1:36:36] darshan jack
[1:36:38] amen
[1:36:40] so when when when you are
[1:36:43] you are
[1:36:44] a man and decide to be a woman
[1:36:46] and i look at you and i'm confused
[1:36:49] you tell me that shall not judge
[1:36:53] i'm confused
[1:36:55] i'm not judging you
[1:36:57] you have put on a nature that i'm
[1:36:59] looking at i'm just describing what i'm
[1:37:00] saying
[1:37:02] i'm not judging you
[1:37:04] amen
[1:37:06] amen
[1:37:07] amen hallelujah
[1:37:09] i believe somebody is blessed tonight
[1:37:11] amen
[1:37:12] amen

[1:37:36] amen
[1:37:37] amen
[1:37:39] amen
[1:37:46] forgive me i'm just taking um
[1:37:49] two quotes and then we are done as i
[1:37:51] said i don't have a message amen
[1:37:53] amen
[1:37:54] so this from the uh the message return
[1:37:57] and jubilee that same message preaching
[1:38:00] 62 program 145. he said the sounding of
[1:38:03] the trumpet
[1:38:05] yes sir
[1:38:06] return dispersed
[1:38:08] but if you sold your inheritance
[1:38:11] if you sold out
[1:38:13] and done these things
[1:38:15] what am i saying
[1:38:16] return back is that if you join up with
[1:38:19] some courts
[1:38:21] that tries to keep you away from
[1:38:23] fellowship with other brethren
[1:38:26] leave the thing this is jubilee
[1:38:29] amen he said i feel religious
[1:38:31] return return this is jubilee don't let
[1:38:34] it pass by remember don't let it pass by
[1:38:39] if you sort out
[1:38:40] if you went out in the world if you've
[1:38:44] seen
[1:38:45] you know that you once had the
[1:38:47] experience
[1:38:48] you went and joined up where you can't
[1:38:50] fellowship with the rest of them
[1:38:53] you've done all these things
[1:38:55] i don't care what you've done
[1:38:57] if you're a son
[1:38:59] you have a right to return
[1:39:02] now because his jubilee is jubilee time
[1:39:08] hallelujah
[1:39:10] amen
[1:39:19] the prophet said this in the chosen of
[1:39:20] her bride
[1:39:22] he said remember
[1:39:23] when the jubilee year come and the
[1:39:26] priest wrote with his trumpet sounding
[1:39:29] that every slave could go free
[1:39:32] but if they refused to accept their
[1:39:35] freedom
[1:39:36] then he had to be taken to the temple to
[1:39:38] a post and an all brought him through
[1:39:41] the ear
[1:39:42] and then he served his master always
[1:39:46] it was put on his ear as a typing of
[1:39:49] hearing
[1:39:51] faith cometh by hearing he heard the
[1:39:54] trump that trumpet but he didn't want to
[1:39:57] listen to ricks
[1:39:59] hallelujah
[1:40:01] so when we put that in there it means
[1:40:04] there is no faith
[1:40:07] there's no more faith
[1:40:12] amen
[1:40:14] now the message the spoken word is
[1:40:16] original seed paragraph 20 says is that
[1:40:19] there is three comings of christ he came
[1:40:21] once to redeem his bride
[1:40:23] he comes next in the rapture
[1:40:26] to catch away his bride
[1:40:28] he comes again
[1:40:30] in a millennium
[1:40:32] with his bride
[1:40:34] everything increase

[1:40:43] seven completion
[1:40:45] two of worship 24 or 40
[1:40:48] tempted

[1:52:25] but this sabbath is taking out
[1:52:28] is taking us out of the low edition age
[1:52:31] into the broad age
[1:52:34] what happened the one who does that is
[1:52:37] the coming down of the mighty angel
[1:52:40] that's why it takes place in 10
[1:52:43] the 10th
[1:52:44] day of the seventh month according to
[1:52:47] revelation 10
[1:52:49] 7
[1:52:50] because in revelation 10 7 the heaven
[1:52:53] have opened
[1:52:55] and now the heaven is blending with the
[1:52:57] earth
[1:52:58] so even though we are living under

[1:59:01] verse 14 nathaniel there
[1:59:05] number four red eye duh
[1:59:08] 15 aussie
[1:59:12] david
[1:59:19] why don't you argue with the scripture
[1:59:23] that there is a contradiction in the
[1:59:25] bible
[1:59:30] why don't you argue with the scripture
[1:59:33] that there is a contradiction in the
[1:59:34] bible
[1:59:37] david the water
[1:59:39] and david is the eighth
[1:59:44] anybody okay
[1:59:46] david the seventh
[1:59:48] by david the eighth
[1:59:53] amen
[1:59:54] you see now are the seven and the eighth
[1:59:57] blend together
[1:59:58] [Music]
[2:00:01] he's number seven but he's also number
[2:00:04] eight
[2:00:05] [Music]
[2:00:07] we are in the seven church ages under
[2:00:10] the seven message i with the seventh
[2:00:13] seal message but we are under eternity
[2:00:16] in the prodigy
[2:00:18] one person
[2:00:21] hallelujah
[2:00:23] amen
[2:00:24] seven ages seventh messenger seventh
[2:00:28] edge under the seventh trumpet
[2:00:32] seventh seal but
[2:00:35] eighth day
[2:00:36] that's why the revelation the seven
[2:00:38] still take you to revelation chapter 8
[2:00:48] anybody okay
[2:00:49] because why because jubilee means grace
[2:00:54] misses
[2:00:56] the capstone is coming crying water
[2:01:01] on the eighth day
[2:01:03] on jubilee
[2:01:06] anybody here so there is a reason
[2:01:09] why he we gotta be a seven and the
[2:01:11] eighth
[2:01:14] anybody here there is a reason why we
[2:01:17] must be a seven and an eight
[2:01:20] a seven you can copy everybody else
[2:01:24] but the eighth is what makes you
[2:01:25] different
[2:01:28] did you get it
[2:01:30] i want to hide it till sunday so you get
[2:01:33] it everybody okay there is a reason why
[2:01:35] you must be seven then eight
[2:01:39] back here the seventh is david
[2:01:42] but the eighth is david when it comes to
[2:01:45] the king anointing
[2:01:48] the king anointing is placed on the
[2:01:51] eighth amen
[2:01:53] amen
[2:01:56] did i lose you
[2:02:01] did i lose
[2:02:02] anybody this bible got a seven
[2:02:09] but there is an eight
[2:02:11] amen
[2:02:12] this bible
[2:02:14] this is a seven
[2:02:15] it's completed it's the completed word
[2:02:18] of god but there is a nation here
[2:02:21] amen amen everybody okay amen
[2:02:25] everybody okay
[2:02:26] this is the seventh this is the complete
[2:02:28] revelation of jesus christ right here
[2:02:32] this is seven
[2:02:34] but here these seven paul can handle it
[2:02:38] the seven arenas can handle it
[2:02:41] the seven columba can handle it the
[2:02:43] seven luther can handle it the seven
[2:02:46] westlake can handle it this seven
[2:02:48] pentecostal can handle it baptists can
[2:02:51] handle it presbyterian can handle it
[2:02:55] denominational can handle it but the
[2:02:58] eighth
[2:03:02] it's only for the bride
[2:03:04] the eighth is not outside the seventh
[2:03:08] it is in the seventh but it's a portion
[2:03:11] that belongs to the bride
[2:03:17] everybody okay so far
[2:03:19] everybody okay so far there is a book of
[2:03:22] life and the lamb's book of life
[2:03:25] the book of life is completed but there
[2:03:28] is a section of the lamb's book of life
[2:03:31] that section is specific for eight amen
[2:03:34] amen
[2:03:36] amen
[2:03:38] everybody okay did i lose anybody
[2:03:41] everybody clear now
[2:03:44] that's why we have a jubilee
[2:03:48] amen anybody here amen that's why i can
[2:03:51] talk with you the bible but i can get
[2:03:53] into a different language
[2:03:55] amen that language is only on the 8th
[2:03:58] it's on revelation 8
[2:04:00] with the opening of the 7th seal but
[2:04:03] when you open the language it's usually
[2:04:05] quiet
[2:04:06] it doesn't speak much
[2:04:08] he unfold the scripture in a different
[2:04:11] way he was muted
[2:04:14] because the lord rested that's why
[2:04:16] whatever happened on the sabbath of the
[2:04:19] land was the same requirement for the
[2:04:22] 50th day of jubilee you don't prune you
[2:04:26] don't sow on the fifth year death you
[2:04:27] don't do the same thing that you were
[2:04:29] doing on the sabbath day showing you
[2:04:31] that this is a hidden sabbath amen it is
[2:04:34] a sabbath that takes you into the
[2:04:36] millennium everybody okay amen
[2:04:39] amen we okay now amen
[2:04:42] we okay now
[2:04:43] amen if i ask you a question you will
[2:04:45] remember
[2:04:47] let's turn
[2:04:52] without revelation
[2:04:54] you will be stuck in david 7 and david 8
[2:05:01] and i have many of them like that
[2:05:04] for people who want to argue
[2:05:07] i can sit down and say the bible says
[2:05:09] here this bible says here since it's
[2:05:11] contradiction and you are logical people
[2:05:14] why don't you reject the bible
[2:05:18] the bible is not meant for logical
[2:05:20] people
[2:05:23] the bible is not meant for people to
[2:05:26] reason
[2:05:27] it will blow your reasoning
[2:05:30] this is the word of god
[2:05:33] amen this reason is completely out it
[2:05:36] doesn't work like that
[2:05:39] the bible is meant to believe
[2:05:42] and the message was hidden in the
[2:05:44] scripture
[2:05:46] that's why the message would never
[2:05:48] contradict the scripture if you find you
[2:05:51] reading brother branham and you find
[2:05:53] that it's blocking with the scripture
[2:05:55] don't get to a conclusion
[2:05:58] leave it alone
[2:06:00] just keep praying
[2:06:01] keep praying keep praying and before you
[2:06:04] know it you will see either a brother
[2:06:06] that the lord will bring or maybe you
[2:06:08] yourself
[2:06:09] especially if you respect the prophet
[2:06:13] and you humble yourself then god will
[2:06:15] open up
[2:06:17] there is one court that i can give you
[2:06:19] that will contradict many courts
[2:06:23] but that quote is not contradicting
[2:06:26] it seems to be contradicting
[2:06:30] brother branham said god sometimes
[2:06:31] leaves stuff like that to get the people
[2:06:33] out of the message
[2:06:35] you hit that you go out but it's not
[2:06:38] contradicting the people
[2:06:40] and because of that court some people
[2:06:42] teach this way some other teach this way
[2:06:44] because that quote and if you go this
[2:06:46] way that court will contradict you
[2:06:48] if you go with this way the other court
[2:06:50] will contradict you
[2:06:53] [Music]
[2:06:56] how are you going to take both coats and
[2:06:58] put them together with that coat
[2:07:00] that's the problem
[2:07:03] and if you can't take your hand off
[2:07:05] respect the prophet say god i believe
[2:07:08] sometime in one year or two or three
[2:07:11] years you see the lord opening stuff and
[2:07:13] you say wow
[2:07:15] i have never seen this before who
[2:07:17] thought the candlestick were almond
[2:07:19] trees
[2:07:23] how many years have you read the
[2:07:24] scripture
[2:07:26] but in his time
[2:07:28] when it's the appropriate time he will
[2:07:30] open and he was right there and you
[2:07:32] wonder you say how can i be reading this
[2:07:34] over and over and i can't even find out
[2:07:37] [Music]
[2:07:39] because the prophet will always be
[2:07:41] zeroed in with the scripture especially
[2:07:44] this one who is greater from enoch
[2:07:48] all the way down the only one beyond him
[2:07:51] is the lord jesus christ
[2:07:54] you need the coach you see me
[2:07:57] amen the only one above brother branham
[2:08:00] his ministry is the lord jesus christ
[2:08:03] amen
[2:08:04] that's why his body have to be
[2:08:06] protected they say you
[2:08:09] you don't go to the nightclub
[2:08:11] you don't smoke
[2:08:12] you don't drink
[2:08:14] you don't do this because the work that
[2:08:16] we have to do here is a different
[2:08:18] candidate it's a different caliber of
[2:08:20] work
[2:08:21] you are responsible for the seals
[2:08:23] he requires something different
[2:08:26] amen
[2:08:27] he had the desire to do that
[2:08:30] but god block it
[2:08:32] because god wanted to do something
[2:08:35] amen
[2:08:36] we're not worshiping a man
[2:08:38] we are worshiping christ by christ to
[2:08:40] reveal himself through a man
[2:08:43] so that we will understand better
[2:08:45] description
[2:08:46] we thought jesus was standing and
[2:08:48] praying for the sick people he took
[2:08:49] brother branham to explain to us that
[2:08:51] that's nothing
[2:08:53] jesus was seeing vision
[2:08:55] that's why he says i do nothing except
[2:08:58] the father shows me
[2:09:00] we were reading that
[2:09:02] we thought because we were uh uh what
[2:09:04] bombarded by the pentecostal we thought
[2:09:07] he was doing the praying line praying
[2:09:08] for the people and god praying for the
[2:09:10] people and go that's not what he was
[2:09:12] doing
[2:09:14] amen it took a profit to demonstrate
[2:09:17] that then we begin to look we say okay
[2:09:19] now we understand why he said virtue
[2:09:22] have left me
[2:09:23] when we see brother brown i'm getting
[2:09:25] tired
[2:09:26] they have to pack him now we begin to
[2:09:28] understand jesus christ
[2:09:32] [Music]
[2:09:33] amen
[2:09:35] very simple ministry
[2:09:37] never complicated
[2:09:39] if you humble yourself you respect
[2:09:42] the office of the prophet
[2:09:44] you don't understand you say father i
[2:09:47] believe it
[2:09:48] you told me when a prophet speak and
[2:09:50] what he spoke happened all i have to do
[2:09:53] is to listen
[2:09:55] not to
[2:09:57] understand it you listen to him if the
[2:09:59] prophet says let's go to the left
[2:10:01] you go to the left because god already
[2:10:03] vindicated it
[2:10:05] amen because later on by the time you're
[2:10:08] understanding up and up you can find
[2:10:10] yourself in trouble
[2:10:12] but if you love your master so much
[2:10:16] if you love your master so much
[2:10:20] the key there
[2:10:22] is that
[2:10:24] when you were under a master
[2:10:26] the master gave you a wife
[2:10:31] you remember that scripture it was not
[2:10:33] the woman you came with
[2:10:34] [Music]
[2:10:36] because the woman you came with you
[2:10:38] chose her
[2:10:40] that was your wife but the one you were
[2:10:43] under you didn't choose her
[2:10:45] because matter of fact under that status
[2:10:47] you were a slave
[2:10:49] so they gave you a wife
[2:10:51] for you to produce more servant
[2:10:55] anybody okay amen but if you love that
[2:10:58] woman
[2:11:00] more
[2:11:01] than the trumpet of jubilee
[2:11:04] or if you love that master because he
[2:11:07] has been a good master for you for years
[2:11:10] for 50 years he never treated you wrong
[2:11:13] he even gave you a wife now you have
[2:11:15] children but if the jubilee sound
[2:11:19] no matter how good the master was
[2:11:22] amen you must esteem the trumpet of
[2:11:26] jubilee beyond damascus
[2:11:29] in other words you can never esteem a
[2:11:32] preacher or a pastor in this message
[2:11:35] beyond the message of the hour
[2:11:37] hallelujah amen
[2:11:40] no matter how good the pastor is the
[2:11:43] message is the top
[2:11:46] amen amen
[2:11:48] anybody here
[2:11:49] you're not supposed to fall in love with
[2:11:51] the prophet
[2:11:52] you're not supposed to fall in love with
[2:11:54] your master
[2:11:56] you're supposed to fall in love with the
[2:11:58] deliverer
[2:11:59] who knew that one day you're gonna get
[2:12:01] in trouble and he prepared a trumpet of
[2:12:04] jubilee to deliver you when you get in
[2:12:06] that state
[2:12:08] and now he's sending the trumpet but you
[2:12:10] fall in love with somebody who has been
[2:12:12] slaving you

[2:18:31] that's why moses in the old testament
[2:18:33] could save meat for your high servant
