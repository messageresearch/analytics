[0:00] faith is not by sight god don't tell you
[0:02] everything
[0:03] trust in the lord in all thy ways and
[0:06] lean not to your own
[0:07] understanding he will lead he will die
[0:10] he will direct your path is that right
[0:12] seek the lord and all thy things you
[0:15] know thy ways
[0:16] and and they do what and acknowledge him
[0:19] is that right
[0:20] not acknowledge him as the lord no
[0:22] matter what nobody try to lift you up
[0:24] thank the lord my brother thank the lord
[0:27] my sister
[0:28] to god be the glory is that right
[0:31] hallelujah
[0:32] we're moving into something saints
[0:35] look what he says he said in a statue
[0:38] you can't walk in it
[0:40] unless god give you the holy ghost
[0:43] for you to be a witness it also is a
[0:45] witness
[0:46] you're also a testimony is that right
[0:50] hallelujah let me keep reading
[0:53] he said and i'm just and i hadn't gotten
[0:56] near to it but that's okay god's having
[0:57] his way
[0:59] he said now look he says and then after
[1:02] god found
[1:03] the they have to found abraham to be
[1:05] faithful to the promise
[1:07] that god gave him that he would have had
[1:10] the child
[1:11] and through this child all the earth
[1:13] would be blessed
[1:14] then god confirmed his faith by giving
[1:16] him a sign
[1:18] and that sign was what circumcision is
[1:20] that right
[1:21] and circumcision is the type of the what
[1:24] holy spirit is that right it's a
[1:26] circumcision where god has to circumcise
[1:28] your heart
[1:29] and god's got to get all that filth out
[1:31] of that heart is that right
[1:33] you got to come love thy god with all
[1:35] thy heart and all thy mind and all thy
[1:37] soul
[1:38] and all thy strength is that right and
[1:40] my wife know the only
[1:41] time she gonna get me for this but after
[1:42] 45 years she ain't she not going
[1:44] anywhere
[1:45] but i got around there only time oh only
[1:48] time i give her that face
[1:49] i'm gonna be honest with you now only
[1:51] time i give her that look is when i'm in
[1:53] there with the lord when i'm in the
[1:54] presence of the lord
[1:56] there's nothing like just being with the
[1:57] lord is that right i'm sure
[1:59] she feel the same way would she have a
[2:01] private time when she's with the lord is
[2:03] that right
[2:04] it's no presence there's nothing like
[2:06] just being with the lord you
[2:08] can't explain it it's a supernatural but
[2:10] once you invite them in when you
[2:12] practice you pray
[2:13] once you environment when you study it
[2:15] once you invite them in it's a presence
[2:17] that cannot be explained
[2:24] look what he says he says just the very
[2:27] text
[2:28] said the very next verse let me drop
[2:30] down
[2:32] he says the circumcision is a type of
[2:34] the holy ghost
[2:36] he says and god gave abram and god gave
[2:38] abraham
[2:39] the circumcision he said after
[2:42] after he had accepted god on his promise
[2:45] and walked
[2:46] out into the strange country it was a
[2:48] sign
[2:49] see what is it saints the holy ghost you
[2:52] receive it by
[2:53] faith it's simple it's not
[2:57] it's just by faith the seed is already
[3:01] in he you not have built the statute of
[3:05] a perfect man if the faith seed is not
[3:08] already there it has to receive so
[3:12] that's why we're moving into another
[3:14] dispensation
[3:15] that's why we're getting what we're
[3:17] getting we thank god for lutheran age
[3:19] we thank god for wesley age we thank god
[3:22] for the pentecostal age
[3:24] but you're going to see imma read some
[3:25] this is greater than that saying
[3:29] yes sir brother c is greater than that
[3:32] is that right hallelujah because he was
[3:36] because of his grace and his mercy he
[3:39] loved us so dearly
[3:40] we had to take you're not going to
[3:42] convince me certain ones
[3:44] up in here again didn't take persecution
[3:48] to take great persecution to get here
[3:51] but it took obedience
[3:52] it took humility it took praying it took
[3:55] science it take trying to take moving
[3:58] into what god has brought you in
[4:00] maybe perhaps i heard his sister say you
[4:02] tried to sing there in the world you
[4:04] know what
[4:05] no no no no no no you know what they
[4:07] used to call whitney houston in the
[4:08] world
[4:09] the voice you
[4:12] you you have the voice
[4:15] [Music]
[4:20] when they move into your position you'll
[4:22] see what i'm talking about
[4:24] you have the voice god halfway through
[4:27] nothing
[4:30] and god has brought what he has brought
[4:32] in here for the end time
[4:33] is that right because you got done see
[4:36] you know when you play basketball
[4:38] it is it's a different you got to get
[4:40] someone to that gift
[4:41] is that right but that gives you have to
[4:43] be trained you know when you're over
[4:45] there and some of y'all maybe went out
[4:46] for basketball whatever you know first
[4:48] when the coach is standing there i'm
[4:49] just giving you
[4:50] a powerful example they look at that
[4:52] person and they recognize right there's
[4:54] a gift
[4:55] he already has a vision god already has
[4:58] chosen you
[4:59] huh you have already been procrastinated
[5:02] you see
[5:02] so the coach stands there when the coach
[5:05] stands there
[5:06] he gets there and he says okay somebody
[5:09] make the first cut
[5:10] is that right now you got another second
[5:12] cut is that right
[5:14] maybe you see you say he's still
[5:15] watching that gift he's seeing something
[5:18] in there
[5:18] that i can use maybe to lead me to a
[5:21] championship
[5:22] he sees something there that's going to
[5:24] ring me there so then you make the final
[5:26] cut
[5:27] now after the final cut what it is he
[5:29] had
[5:30] drills the coach had drills to see your
[5:33] skills is that right
[5:35] now once you make the team man he's got
[5:38] drills to sharpen your skills to bring
[5:41] you up
[5:42] to get ready for the trial is that right
[5:46] god now is opening the word is that
[5:49] right
[5:49] the third pull is the opening of the
[5:52] word
[5:53] is that what the holy ghost said the
[5:55] opening of the word
[5:56] the only thing left is what brother you
[5:59] going home is that right
[6:01] nobody knows that secret hallelujah and
[6:06] what did he tell us
[6:08] you're going to run across these spirits
[6:11] god just don't give it to you no
[6:12] he said what what brother prophet of god
[6:16] said
[6:17] seven seal was a mystery
[6:21] the hidden things belong to god but once
[6:24] he revealed that it belongs to me
[6:26] the holy ghost told me last wednesday he
[6:29] only spoke that
[6:31] when he was speaking of going home
[6:34] is that right nobody knows the time is
[6:37] that right
[6:38] so god unfolded that so you'll be able
[6:40] to help somebody
[6:42] not to fight nobody not to combat nobody
[6:46] the brother but the lord showed us is
[6:49] that now
[6:50] going when he mentioned that seven seals
[6:53] was not being open
[6:55] is that now is because nobody knows the
[6:59] coming of the lord but god is that right
[7:02] see he's giving you a weapon to set
[7:04] somebody free
[7:06] maybe somebody is stuck right in that
[7:08] area on this message
[7:10] do you see what i'm saying but god will
[7:12] not be mocked
[7:13] he said he's not going to lose not a one
[7:15] saints
[7:19] hallelujah i mean it sister
[7:22] sing like you never sang before get
[7:25] yourself consecrated
[7:26] you get this time we got war we didn't
[7:28] set war
[7:29] against the devil is that right how are
[7:31] you sending them out

[7:34] think it's second chronicles 20.
[7:37] that's the scripture that come to me
[7:38] help me lord
[7:41] this is not a play play last time when
[7:43] we was here
[7:44] the armies were setting the ray river
[7:47] right i mean they was getting in order
[7:49] but david he recognized david was the
[7:51] atheist is that right
[7:52] david had a four son he was the eighth
[7:55] son he came in there by him being in
[7:57] there
[7:57] david recognized david was representing
[8:01] that bride at the time he had the
[8:03] fullness at that time
[8:05] he went against goliath the prophet that
[8:07] god preached the greatest battle ever
[8:09] fought
[8:09] the greatest battle ever fought was the
[8:11] mind the devil is the bluff
[8:13] is that right we the jesus christ
[8:15] defeated him on cal brad
[8:17] and he came in there boasting that david
[8:19] but remember when the goliath came to
[8:21] david
[8:22] he was the champion of the champion but
[8:24] he recognize
[8:25] that david had god with him david had
[8:28] the experiences with him
[8:29] that god came and met him when he was
[8:32] out there in the woods
[8:33] he came to take one of the sheep uh by
[8:36] the lion and the bear but david wasn't
[8:38] going for it you're uncircumcised
[8:40] philistines

[8:46] living god
[8:47] god had given us a ministry to tie the
[8:50] tie in all the
[8:51] loose things that's why he sends the
[8:53] ribbon ball

[9:31] for the sake of time second chronicles

[9:35] and let's look at uh 20.
[9:39] he says and they rose early in the
[9:41] morning and went for
[9:42] and went forth into the wilderness and
[9:45] tikka
[9:46] as they went forth jehoshaphat stood and
[9:50] he said
[9:50] hear me o judah oh i'm loving judah now
[9:57] and ye in the habits of jerusalem
[10:00] believe in the lord your god
[10:03] so shall be established believe his
[10:05] prophet sir
[10:06] so shall ye what prosperous he says and
[10:10] when he had consulted
[10:11] with the people he appointed what he
[10:14] appointed what
[10:16] let me hear the singer say he appointed
[10:18] what
[10:19] ah god appointed you
[10:25] god appointed you for this battle god
[10:28] sent two musicians out for this battle
[10:31] god did it evil just relax
[10:34] pray sing the song to jesus christ
[10:38] let them come and anoint you for the
[10:40] glory of god
[10:45] he said now in the lord the singers and
[10:48] to the lord
[10:49] and that should praise the beauty of
[10:50] what holiness
[10:52] that they went out before the army and
[10:55] said
[10:56] and to say praise the lord
[10:59] he says for his what mercy endured
[11:02] forever
[11:04] and when they began to what into what
[11:08] the lord said what they say what
[11:16] we need you to sing us you're ambushed
[11:19] see when you get down what you say
[11:21] brother see
[11:22] when you get down in the valley and when
[11:25] amalek thinks that you're down now
[11:27] when amalek thinks that you're low he
[11:29] says
[11:31] the blood whoa
[11:34] the blood the blood don't sign
[11:38] my name
[11:48] you're defeated when you're in that
[11:50] valley sing praises
[11:56] lift him up it confounds the enemy
[12:01] look what he says he says and when they
[12:04] began to sink
[12:05] and to praise the lord said ambush
[12:08] who set the ambush he cannot set an
[12:12] ambush
[12:13] why you think he had the pastor in that
[12:14] area he had
[12:16] he cannot set the ambush is that right
[12:19] because he always got the people through
[12:21] music remember nebuchadnezzar
[12:24] the first thing he did he said when you
[12:26] hear me play the music
[12:27] you start dancing you see them today
[12:30] right
[12:30] some of them like chickens
[12:36] see a chicken in the yard
[12:40] looking for scraps didn't see no ego
[12:42] down there
[12:43] huh that's what they do as soon as they
[12:45] play that music the boom
[12:47] the spirit starts you see what i'm
[12:49] saying
[12:50] demon forces is all out there you got
[12:53] 200 million demons loose right now
[12:56] how do i know right but we got to what
[12:58] the power of the holy ghost
[13:00] the powers say cast down every
[13:03] imagination and try to exalt itself
[13:06] against the word of god is that right
[13:09] huh no weapons formed against you
[13:12] shall prosper when the enemy come in
[13:14] like a flood
[13:15] god should do what lift up a mighty
[13:18] standard
[13:20] hallelujah
[13:22] [Music]
[13:23] he says in ambush the children of who
[13:26] emma
[13:27] moaz mountain syria which would come
[13:30] against
[13:31] judah and they were what smith
[13:34] see what praises and singing do he's
[13:36] sending out the singers in them first
[13:38] hallelujah let me keep reading
[13:41] lord help us lord he said now look
[13:44] it's a sign he says all and all his
[13:47] children
[13:48] and his seed after him should have this
[13:51] sign
[13:52] in their flesh because it was a
[13:54] distinction it was the separation
[13:56] them from all other peoples this the
[13:59] sign
[14:00] of the circumcision the sign with us you
[14:03] are different
[14:04] if there if you didn't have the
[14:06] circumcision under the under the law
[14:08] i think you've got to you could write it
[14:10] down i think it's a uh
[14:11] uh genesis 17 and maybe around genesis
[14:14] 17
[14:15] and he talks about if you didn't have
[14:17] the circumcision you guys
[14:18] you couldn't even have fellowship he
[14:20] ain't separated
[14:22] see if they don't have what we have in
[14:24] this hour here now how can you
[14:25] fellowship with them
[14:26] how are you looking back with them a ego
[14:29] and a budget cannot fellowship together
[14:31] saints is just that close i'm telling
[14:34] you we've got testimonies
[14:36] we got testimonies out there and we're
[14:38] as assuming that god is answering people
[14:40] prayers
[14:41] calling on the name of the lord jesus
[14:43] christ when he's out there people's
[14:45] getting delivered from the kovic
[14:47] simple natural simple natural things are
[14:50] happening brother robert
[14:51] just because of people praying just
[14:53] because the people are
[14:55] are continuing sighing and crying for
[14:57] the condition of this land
[14:59] they know that the sickness or the
[15:00] diseases cannot come upon
[15:02] us because not only we have a promise is
[15:05] that right
[15:05] he said that i would leave and guide you
[15:07] into all truth is that right
[15:09] let me keep reading because i want to
[15:10] get to some some things help me lord
[15:13] he says now he says and all he says and
[15:16] that's what god uses today
[15:18] it's the sign of circumcision of the
[15:20] what of the heart we went into ezekiel
[15:22] 36 on that
[15:23] he says in the holy spirit that makes
[15:26] god's church
[15:27] you see a separated church from all
[15:30] other creeds and
[15:31] faiths and denominations they're in all
[15:34] kinds
[15:34] of denominations but yet they are a
[15:37] separate people god's people as a
[15:39] separate
[15:40] people of course we know god called us
[15:41] out of that system long time ago
[15:43] is that right so now we just look and
[15:46] continue looking
[15:47] good to catch one here and catch one
[15:49] over there because god is soon to come
[15:51] he's not going to allow us to just
[15:54] continue to keep going on this way
[15:56] some people want things to get back to
[15:58] normal but what they want to get back to
[16:00] normal says sinful life
[16:02] that's not normal that's a sin for life
[16:04] that's all they want to get back to
[16:06] and god's not going to tolerate it and
[16:08] god is sick of his foolishness right now
[16:10] they're dealing with an angry god
[16:12] they're dealing with a god that
[16:14] that's about to bring his judgment on
[16:16] these folks around him now
[16:17] he already told us the prophet of god in
[16:20] the end time evangelism message you
[16:22] ought to go listen to it and see what
[16:24] we're up against in this end time
[16:26] i'm telling you guys that that royal
[16:28] church that they call
[16:29] out there now they're speaking like a
[16:32] false prophet
[16:33] oh god and so we got to understand now
[16:36] what the lord is bringing us into just
[16:38] bear with me saints i'm gonna have to
[16:39] jump a little bit
[16:40] he said now he said now not pattern
[16:44] he says uh not pattern today
[16:48] that today persons who refuse to receive
[16:52] the baptism of the holy ghost
[16:55] can have no fellowship among those that
[16:58] has
[16:59] the holy ghost you just can't do it
[17:02] you see i'm going to jump because i want
[17:05] you i want to bring you i don't want to
[17:07] leave you
[17:08] back in there i want to bring you up to
[17:11] just in time
[17:13] over
[17:16] can you see right here 16
[17:21] help me lord it says yeah
[17:24] in time let's look at some things here
[17:27] see why the lord have us where he has us
[17:31] he said back in the early days when the
[17:34] things was
[17:35] was wide wide away luther taught
[17:38] justification
[17:39] but just like the holy spirit said to
[17:42] brother steve
[17:43] you couldn't good the fullness in that
[17:45] time
[17:46] luther didn't have the footage he had
[17:48] that portion because what he smoked the
[17:49] pipe
[17:50] god honored him smoking a pipe and i
[17:52] think they drank beer
[17:54] but look let us move on but the holy
[17:56] spirit was still there now there's a
[17:57] portion of it
[17:59] he said now look back in the early days
[18:02] when the thing was wide away and luther
[18:04] taught the justification by faith
[18:06] he said that was just to bring the
[18:08] people from catholicism
[18:10] to into politicism he says in the
[18:13] fellowship
[18:14] around the word he said justification by
[18:16] faith that was a big wise spirit
[18:18] he says they never moved from that see
[18:21] he says along came another revival with
[18:24] john wesley it shook them down
[18:26] from brought her from down to
[18:29] sanctification
[18:30] still with me she was brother now those
[18:32] that was in
[18:33] luther that got stuck with luther didn't
[18:36] have fellowship with wesley
[18:38] here with me because they brought them
[18:39] with this sanctification
[18:41] he said now look he says but give joy
[18:44] in your heart that's all it could give
[18:46] you that shook off
[18:48] a lot of lutherans he says then along
[18:51] come pentecost with the baptism of the
[18:54] holy ghost
[18:55] and narrowed it down again by receiving
[18:57] what the holy ghost
[18:58] that's right he says and now that's
[19:01] beginning to shake down
[19:02] he said and the gifts and the
[19:04] restoration and the spirit of god
[19:06] has come in the fullness of the signs
[19:08] and wonders into the church
[19:10] and has shook pentecost see what is it
[19:14] we're so close to coming of the lord
[19:16] jesus until the very spirit
[19:18] that was in him is working in the church
[19:21] he says doing he's doing the very same
[19:23] thing
[19:24] that he did when he was on earth it's
[19:27] never been
[19:28] anywhere back from the time of the
[19:30] apostles
[19:31] he says until what until now remember
[19:34] now what is he's doing now
[19:36] showing that is in the church he's
[19:38] opening the word is that right
[19:40] it's the opening of the word he's
[19:42] bringing around in here until now that's
[19:44] her third pull right
[19:45] now we got one more thing i want to read
[19:48] to you
[19:48] god help me he says now and
[19:52] wesley after luther he says on down
[19:54] through the age
[19:55] it comes as soon as one revival is over
[19:58] god raises up another and throws more
[20:00] and what but he brings more light
[20:04] just keeps moving like that see it
[20:08] doesn't stop
[20:10] he says now we're at the end musicians
[20:12] you can come on up please
[20:14] he says now we're at the end of this
[20:16] time
[20:17] each man has looked at the end of his
[20:19] junction
[20:20] for the coming of christ he says but
[20:24] they had a lot to look forward to the
[20:26] returning of the jews
[20:27] flying saucers in the sky because we
[20:29] know they were investigating angels
[20:31] he says all the things that we see today
[20:34] but we are
[20:35] at the end it says we are here they
[20:38] they know the church was to receive
[20:41] power that would work in the church the
[20:44] same works of
[20:45] christ because as the shadow becomes
[20:48] deeper and deeper and reflects more you
[20:52] take a shadow i'm a drop down
[20:54] he says now now the spirit of god has
[20:57] worked
[20:58] under the justification on the luther
[21:00] sanctification on the wesley the baptism
[21:02] of the holy ghost on the pentecost
[21:04] and here it is in what the last days
[21:08] you see what you're getting come on now
[21:11] performing
[21:12] and doing the very same thing that it
[21:15] did when it was in christ
[21:17] what is it the church and christ has
[21:20] become
[21:21] one again he said see it's christ here
[21:25] it's christ opening those scriptures
[21:27] it's christ's unveiling those mystery
[21:29] it's christ doing it again when they was
[21:32] on the road to the mayor's
[21:33] what was she doing he was opening the
[21:36] scriptures

[21:52] he said now look he said and as soon as
[21:55] they
[21:55] as soon as they connect together as soon
[21:59] as we
[21:59] connect together that last link
[22:03] she'll go through the sky shouting
[22:07] up will come wesley up will come luther
[22:11] and all the rest of them back in those
[22:14] days
