[39:37] seals the adoption or somebody is in the
[39:40] message of the hour amen you're
[39:43] listening to the message of the hour
[39:45] there is nothing else that I can point
[39:47] you but the Bible and the message of the
[39:49] hour amen glory to God young sisters I'm
[39:53] still waiting for your date and young
[39:55] men meeting brother Kelly brother Robert
[39:59] if you can confirm to brother Enoch so
[40:01] we know and nail this completely for the
[40:03] month of uh May yesterday we had a
[40:07] question and
[40:08] answer which turned out to be a
[40:12] sermon I preach a sermon that I didn't
[40:15] even prepare and I went home I say wow I
[40:18] preach without an
[40:20] iPad without a computer amen and by
[40:24] God's grace that was wonderful things
[40:26] begin to to open up and I begin to see
[40:28] things clearly but thank God it was
[40:30] recorded so whenever I want to preach
[40:33] that message somewhere I will be able to
[40:35] do it amen and every single quote I
[40:38] handed to you it's on the church group
[40:41] chat I gave you six if I'm not mistaken
[40:44] about a fleece and how to place a fleece
[40:46] before the Lord so you know what it is
[40:48] you know what brother Bram say you know
[40:50] your position we don't want any
[40:52] foolishness because brother brandham God
[40:55] warned him in the seventh seal that hey
[40:57] do not go and start any easm or
[41:00] something like that just remain calm and
[41:03] clear and the Holy Spirit will lead you
[41:05] like a sister say yesterday we are
[41:07] already lamb so we already have a fleece
[41:10] but you will know when to apply it and
[41:12] how to move in the direction that the
[41:15] Lord wants you to do amen so God's that
[41:18] was his sovereignty he want me to handle
[41:20] one question so that was what we did so
[41:24] but it turned up to be wonderful by
[41:26] God's grace amen so you ready for the
[41:28] word let's go straight to our scripture
[41:31] this morning in Genesis chap
[41:35] 39 glory to
[41:37] God
[41:40] hallelujah let's see how far we can go
[41:43] by the grace of
[41:45] God
[41:47] Amen thank you Jesus you there Genesis
[41:51] 39 verse
[41:55] one somebody should even guess what
[41:57] we're
[42:00] reading amen
[42:03] amen 39 verse
[42:06] one and
[42:08] Joseph was brought down do you hear me
[42:12] okay well all the way to the back yes
[42:15] sister you can hear me better okay uh
[42:19] brother bundu you can hear me better
[42:22] praise God I already gave you a quote
[42:24] when the prophet is asking about the
[42:26] sons somebody need to respond from the
[42:29] audience amen
[42:32] am brother brandham say God gave Adam
[42:36] and Eve a wall of
[42:38] protection and that wall was the word of
[42:41] God that's right so your protection is
[42:44] to stand behind the word amen so my
[42:47] protection is to make sure whatever I
[42:49] tell you in this church amen I have to
[42:52] cover myself with the word of God Amen I
[42:54] must have a Bible scripture and a code
[42:57] and I protected myself so whenever you
[42:59] bringing your
[43:00] attack you not bumping against me you
[43:03] bumping against the Bible and the word
[43:06] of God and God will handle you
[43:09] yourself you will see me behind the word
[43:11] I'm saying hello God bless you if you
[43:14] bump you bump against brother Bram and
[43:16] the people who tried to bump against
[43:18] brother Bram go see what happened to
[43:21] them at the beginning it seems like
[43:23] everything is working after a while
[43:25] you're going down like a Titanic and a
[43:28] Titan amen because you challenge a
[43:31] Vindicated Prophet amen that's why
[43:33] whatever I do in this church everything
[43:36] the way I position even the music even
[43:38] the musician training I give you even
[43:40] the C the scripture for it I put
[43:42] everything in the word and I can go to
[43:44] sleep in peace amen because I place the
[43:47] people on the word and I know that one
[43:50] of these day the word that I have been
[43:52] preaching to you that word will take you
[43:54] to the brro amen that one I'm very
[43:57] confident because heaven and earth will
[43:59] pass away but the word of God will
[44:02] remain forever amen amen those that have
[44:06] been praying to be seated let's go with
[44:08] verse one
[44:10] first it's a relaxing my friend and
[44:13] Joseph was brought down to Egypt and
[44:17] Piper an officer of who Pharaoh you
[44:20] might be seated so they brought him to
[44:23] this man called Piper you know that he's
[44:26] a mil
[44:28] man Lord help me if I can reach there
[44:31] he's not a Christian believing the
[44:34] message he's a
[44:36] heathen he's an
[44:38] Egyptian he beli in a false god yes but
[44:42] he life is necessary for the Journey of
[44:47] Joseph he's very important amen amen
[44:50] he's a military man an officer of the
[44:53] Guard a man very close to to
[44:59] Pharaoh amen amen they never took him
[45:01] straight to Pharaoh m- you got to go
[45:04] through the P for house amen and the
[45:06] Bible says captain of the Guard an
[45:09] Egyptian bought him of the hands of the
[45:12] ishmaelite which had brought him down
[45:16] here that question is something
[45:19] ishmaelite amen they called them
[45:22] medanite and they called them ishmaelite
[45:25] Ishmael came from Hagar that's right and
[45:27] medanite came from K how can they be the
[45:30] same people this Bible is something amen
[45:34] amen and the Lord was with Joseph and he
[45:38] was a prosperous man and he was in the
[45:41] house of his master the Christian no the
[45:45] Hebrew no he was a master to Joseph how
[45:50] can God give you a master that is not a
[45:52] message believer
[45:57] verse three and his master so that the
[46:00] Lord was with him the Heathen
[46:04] man the adol M could discern that H this
[46:09] boy got a God Amen and that God is
[46:12] working amen amen amen he had other God
[46:16] they were not working for his businesses
[46:19] but when this God came everything begin
[46:21] to change so there is something
[46:23] particular about this boy amen amen amen
[46:26] the Bible say and then his master verse
[46:29] three so that the Lord was with him and
[46:32] that the Lord made all that he did to
[46:36] prosper in his
[46:38] hand
[46:40] yes remember Joseph is a slave amen
[46:44] that's
[46:46] right Joseph is a slave now he's a slave
[46:51] servant so he got some responsibility
[46:57] we clear amen amen glory to God verse
[47:01] four and Joseph found Grace in his sight
[47:05] and he serve him serve the hidden
[47:10] man the man that is not a message
[47:12] believer Joseph serve him Joseph didn't
[47:16] say because you don't believe the seven
[47:18] SE I'm not going to listen to
[47:24] you did that get it
[47:27] he didn't say because you don't believe
[47:28] brother brandham to be a prophet I'm not
[47:31] going to listen to you Joseph serve
[47:35] him so if Piper say I want to have my
[47:38] food at 5:00 Joseph got to bring the
[47:40] food at 5:00 even though Piper don't
[47:42] believe the message of the hour
[47:45] amen glory to God verse 5 and it came to
[47:50] pass from the time that he had made him
[47:53] what overseer somebody got a promotion
[47:56] in his house house and over all that he
[47:59] had that the Lord blessed the Egyptian
[48:02] house the Heathen house that don't
[48:05] believe the message of the hour the Lord
[48:07] blessed the Egyptian house for Joseph's
[48:10] sake amen and the blessing of the Lord
[48:14] was upon all that he had in the house
[48:17] and in the field so God didn't make a
[48:20] distinction God is focusing on Joseph
[48:23] amen and whatever Joseph touches God
[48:26] bless
[48:27] where Joseph is God bless him he's in
[48:30] the house of Piper guess what God begin
[48:33] to bless him do you know what happened
[48:34] to the Ark of the Covenant he was taken
[48:37] uhhuh and when he was taken somebody
[48:38] died and they stopped they say you know
[48:40] what we can't take the ark to the
[48:42] destination this is a trouble which
[48:44] house is around here oh this is the
[48:46] house of brother uh Joshua codo they say
[48:50] take the ark and put it there it there
[48:53] and when they put it there guess what
[48:54] the Lord begin to bless the house amen
[48:57] the ark was not in the
[49:01] Tabernacle he ended up to
[49:03] [Music]
[49:04] be hophazardly
[49:07] according to us in the house of somebody
[49:11] and because the ark was there God begin
[49:13] to bless them man and when David says
[49:16] you can't stay with that thing over
[49:18] there he forgot about killing somebody
[49:20] he say let me get that thing out of
[49:22] there because I can see that the
[49:24] blessing of the Lord is there wherever
[49:27] you put it it's going to bless you amen
[49:29] amen hallelujah verse 6 and he left all
[49:33] that he had in Joseph what hand and he
[49:37] knew not anything that he had save the
[49:39] what the bread which he did eat and
[49:41] Joseph was a goodly person and well
[49:44] favored now we found out that this
[49:47] responsibility of
[49:50] Joseph amen amen goes to
[49:54] everything that part far owns
[49:57] amen everything that party fall
[50:04] owns amen but we got some
[50:08] exceptions the first
[50:13] exception the
[50:15] food of P that one he still have some
[50:19] supervision on it so there is an area
[50:22] that belong to Joseph there is an area
[50:24] that belong to Piper right there is an
[50:27] area that belong to your boss that's
[50:29] right amen and you also got your
[50:32] job we clear on that one verse uh 7 and
[50:37] it came to pass after these things that
[50:40] his master's Wife cast her eyes upon
[50:43] Joseph and she said lie with me but he
[50:48] refused and said to his master's wife
[50:51] behold my master knows not what is with
[50:54] me in the house because everything is
[50:56] under his jurisdiction and he had
[50:59] committed all that he has to my hand
[51:03] that is his area he's d man there is
[51:08] none greater in this house than I the
[51:11] position neither has he kept back
[51:14] anything from me but who the so the
[51:19] second exception is the wife amen
[51:28] amen amen so these two things Joseph is
[51:31] not supposed to touch
[51:32] them everything else Joseph can touch it
[51:36] P if I have no problem about it but
[51:39] these two that's not your domain amen so
[51:43] when you go to a work place you will
[51:47] have your
[51:49] limitations that's right
[51:53] amen amen amen you will have your field
[51:58] of work amen and your limitations where
[52:03] you're not supposed to be getting they
[52:05] say this is for the supervisor only if
[52:07] you're not the supervisor don't go
[52:10] there are we clear amen look where Satan
[52:13] is attacking
[52:15] Joseph verse 9 uh verse uh 9 there is
[52:21] none greater in this house than I
[52:23] neither has he kept back anything from
[52:26] me but you because you are his wife how
[52:30] then can I do this great wickedness and
[52:34] sin against God somebody try first to
[52:38] get you off from your job responsibility
[52:41] right and you standing you say no no no
[52:44] no no no no no I know what I'm supposed
[52:46] to do this is not what I
[52:49] was uh appointed in this company for I'm
[52:52] supposed to do this not this that's the
[52:55] area the devil will get you amen will
[52:59] attack you verse 10 and it came to pass
[53:02] as she spoke to Joseph what day by day
[53:06] so she never told Joseph to do something
[53:09] that Joseph was already
[53:12] allowed that's right because there is no
[53:15] temptation there uhhuh the Temptation
[53:17] always will happen where there is
[53:19] limitation amen where you got
[53:21] restriction amen that's where the devil
[53:23] attack you amen come on
[53:27] if they tell you get into your work you
[53:29] can use your cell phone there is no
[53:30] temptation that's that's right because
[53:32] you can have your cell phone and doing
[53:34] whatever you doing and working no
[53:36] temptation but if they make you sign a
[53:38] paper and they say in this company do
[53:41] not use cell phone when you're in church
[53:43] do not use cell
[53:46] phon guess what that is when the devil
[53:49] will tempt you with a cell phone only
[53:51] when the church service is going on
[53:55] Amen and that's when they're going to
[53:57] send you an important text
[54:00] message only when the church service is
[54:03] going
[54:06] on because that's where you can
[54:10] sin and be off from your path that's
[54:13] right are we clear amen verse uh 11 and
[54:18] it came to pass about this time that
[54:22] Joseph went into the house to do what
[54:26] his business so somebody was going to do
[54:28] his business his field of action he went
[54:31] to his
[54:32] business he went to his work doing his
[54:35] work normal work prayed in the morning
[54:38] wake up good day oh it's beautiful
[54:40] outside praise be to the name of the
[54:42] Lord going to work and start singing
[54:44] Glory Glory Hallelujah didn't know what
[54:47] was coming up amen amen and then he went
[54:51] to do his business and there was none of
[54:55] the men of the house there
[54:58] inside so number one nobody's
[55:03] there nobody is there brother Bram even
[55:06] say that party for
[55:09] traveled I have the quote I give it to
[55:11] you if you forget I can bring it to you
[55:13] part for the master
[55:15] travel amen amen maybe whenever this
[55:20] woman was coming before and talk to him
[55:23] day by day maybe people were around
[55:27] and he said no I cannot do that I cannot
[55:29] do that so the woman made sure that day
[55:31] pipy is going where are you going I'm
[55:33] going to Georgia he say no problem it
[55:35] takes 4 hours to go 4 hours to come back
[55:38] that's 8 hours that's
[55:40] right so we got our Windows who's in the
[55:43] house nobody's in the house that's fine
[55:46] whenever there is no
[55:48] [Music]
[55:52] supervision amen amen that's when the
[55:55] Temptation comes amen
[55:57] amen amen amen the first time you refus
[56:00] you refus because pyer was
[56:03] there
[56:04] God did you refuse because they had a
[56:07] work was there and if he sees you he's
[56:10] going to tell pipa you know what I saw
[56:12] your wife and Joseph talking in the
[56:14] corner over there wow wow wow that is
[56:17] very easy to stay under
[56:20] commandment because somebody's watching
[56:22] you because the Deacon is sitting at the
[56:25] corner
[56:26] it's very easy not to touch the cell
[56:30] phone am so God will open up an
[56:34] opportunity where you have no
[56:36] supervision Amen to see if you obey the
[56:39] Commandment only under supervision or
[56:43] not supervision when mommy's there
[56:45] you're going to watch Christian movie
[56:48] God will take mommy and daddy away
[56:50] somewhere else and leave you the house
[56:52] to see what kind of movie you going to
[56:54] watch if momy and Daddy are not
[57:01] there
[57:03] amen if you don't pass that test you're
[57:07] going to stay in the house of partyer if
[57:09] you pass that test when there is no
[57:12] supervision then God shift you to
[57:14] another one amen amen amen there was a

[57:57] word if you don't learn from what God is
[57:59] trying to teach you you will stay in
[58:02] that class until you graduated amen
[58:06] until you pass the test then God will
[58:08] take you to the next level amen so

[1:12:25] Bible says and there shall come forth a
[1:12:27] what a rod out of what the stem of Jess

[1:13:25] the Bible say and shall make him of what
[1:13:28] of quick understanding in the what the

[1:20:41] amen the scent will judge the what world
[1:20:44] and you will also judge What
[1:20:48] Angels what a great responsibility am
[1:20:52] listen to this this is the Lord Jesus
[1:20:54] Christ in John 7 verse 23 the Bible say
[1:20:59] if a man on the Sabbath day receive what
[1:21:02] circumcision that the law of Moses
[1:21:05] should not be what broken are ye angry
[1:21:08] at me because I have made a man every
[1:21:12] withold on the what Sabbath day so Jesus
[1:21:15] heals somebody on the Sabbath day and
[1:21:18] the Pharisee came they said no this is
[1:21:21] the Sabbath day you can't heal nobody
[1:21:25] Jesus turn around and look at them he
[1:21:28] said you know the reason why you're
[1:21:29] talking like this because it's not your
[1:21:32] child if he was your child he I see
[1:21:35] you and I come to heal him you won't say
[1:21:37] like this okay you know the law of Moses
[1:21:41] right amen you circumcise somebody do
[1:21:44] you wait for that day to be uh Monday or
[1:21:47] Tuesday or the Sabbath day if it's the
[1:21:50] eighth day whether it's on the Sabbath
[1:21:52] day or not what do you do you
[1:21:53] circumstance he say okay you did
[1:21:55] something good you respected the law
[1:21:57] what about healing somebody so we have
[1:21:59] to let this person die until
[1:22:06] tomorrow why because they already have a
[1:22:09] bad
[1:22:10] intent toward the lord Jesus Christ even
[1:22:14] if something is righteous they're trying
[1:22:16] to find fault with it that's right and
[1:22:18] listen what Jesus say Jesus said this in
[1:22:21] verse 24 judge not according to to the
[1:22:25] what but judge how righteous
[1:22:29] judgment never look at somebody because
[1:22:32] they got tattoo that's right and you say
[1:22:35] he must be the one that M
[1:22:38] upop they other the one that never even
[1:22:40] smoke might be more criminal than the
[1:22:43] one with a tto exactly right that's
[1:22:49] correct god rebuked brother Brahma and
[1:22:52] told him don't call those people Ricky
[1:22:55] because my children are there if you
[1:22:57] look at those children some of them got
[1:22:58] even ear nose that's right that's
[1:23:02] right ear pieces in the nose or whatever
[1:23:05] you call
[1:23:07] it what are you going to say this one
[1:23:10] will go to hell don't judge with the
[1:23:14] appearance s Samuel made that mistake
[1:23:17] God said go find the king do you know
[1:23:19] what happened Samuel getting there he
[1:23:21] look at somebody to he said this is the
[1:23:23] king look at his head he's going to feed
[1:23:25] the crown God say the Holy One doesn't
[1:23:28] look at
[1:23:29] appear the Holy One is looking in
[1:23:33] the he look good with a crown but he's
[1:23:36] probably the bad
[1:23:41] one and who called David a nauy
[1:23:46] boy who did
[1:23:48] it the one that was supposed to be
[1:23:51] king according to the appearance of men
[1:23:54] John 8 verse1 15 the Bible say ye judge
[1:23:58] after what the flesh I judge no man and
[1:24:02] yet if I judge my judgment is how is
[1:24:04] true why for I am not alone but I am the
[1:24:08] father that did what that in other words
[1:24:11] Jesus never judge somebody except the
[1:24:14] father in him does the Judgment that's
[1:24:20] right if the little matters you don't
[1:24:23] know how to judge how are you going to
[1:24:26] judge the world how are you going to
[1:24:29] judge the angel how do you connect this
[1:24:31] to
[1:24:34] Joseph amen let's go to verse uh three
[1:24:39] know ye not that we shall judge What
[1:24:43] Angels how much more things that pertain
[1:24:46] to what this life so God will bring

[1:46:29] train and the Bible says that if not no
[1:46:33] suffering amen no glory and listen to
[1:46:36] the Bible second Timothy verse two Paul
[1:46:40] say if we do what suffer in other word
[1:46:43] we identify with suffering we shall also
[1:46:46] what rain with so you won R if you
[1:46:48] didn't suffer amen I want that to sock
[1:46:51] in
[1:46:53] amen even Jesus Christ before he
[1:46:55] received a new name he had to suffer he
[1:46:58] had to be rejected fely accused spit
[1:47:02] upon taken his glove and His Garment and
[1:47:05] they lie upon him they crucify him after
[1:47:08] the Throne all of that are taking you to
[1:47:11] your glory amen so when you see
[1:47:14] rejection when you see suffering when
[1:47:17] you see backbiting when you are
[1:47:19] crucified begin to thank God because
[1:47:22] what come after suffering is the glory
[1:47:25] amen what comes after suffering is the
[1:47:28] throne
[1:47:29] [Applause]
[1:47:31] amen are we together amen are we
[1:47:34] together amen amen before he reaches
[1:47:37] there even though he's Lord of all God
[1:47:39] have to put you through tutor those
[1:47:42] tutor are the people that God himself
[1:47:46] will choose that's right if you notice
[1:47:49] there are two words there one is a tutor
[1:47:53] and one is a governor a tutor is a
[1:47:56] private
[1:47:58] teacher yes sir somebody that work with
[1:48:02] a small
[1:48:04] group or somebody that deal one onone
[1:48:08] with
[1:48:10] you so God will appoint you somebody
[1:48:14] that will hander you
[1:48:17] [Applause]
[1:48:20] closer somebody that will be following
[1:48:23] you it looks like when is this person
[1:48:26] going to get off my back it is God that
[1:48:29] put him there because without that
[1:48:32] person you won't learn your future
[1:48:36] career
[1:48:38] on without that person you want to cut
[1:48:40] Corners that's right that's right a
[1:48:43] tutor is a private instructor and when
[1:48:46] you look at the governor is somebody
[1:48:48] who's teaching you about the
[1:48:51] laws about the rulle ship about the
[1:48:54] authority so God will CER a Ministry
[1:48:58] that will be teaching you and preparing
[1:49:00] you towards your
[1:49:03] position so sometime it will be teaching
[1:49:06] sometime it will be to make you
[1:49:08] recognize who you are and understand
[1:49:11] what is your task ahead it is God doing
[1:49:14] that through the farall
[1:49:19] ministry are we together are we together
[1:49:22] am so those teachers are appointed by
[1:49:26] God and the time is appointed by God if
[1:49:30] you go to university there is a time
[1:49:32] appointed for you to be an engineer they
[1:49:34] will tell you you go four years you get
[1:49:36] your degrees they will tell you you go 2
[1:49:38] years you got your degree they will tell
[1:49:40] you you go three month you get your
[1:49:41] certificate there is an appointed time
[1:49:43] there is a teacher there there is an
[1:49:45] instructor there is somebody there to
[1:49:47] prepare you for the oncoming service
[1:49:49] amen that's why this road here as a
[1:49:53] servant this garment is a ragged one
[1:49:58] that's right because it's connected with
[1:50:01] suffering brother Bram says this glory
[1:50:04] to God you know Christianity has changed
[1:50:07] so much when in these last days Ah
[1:50:10] that's where the changing happened now
[1:50:12] you got to do what baby a
[1:50:15] person you got to promise them what a
[1:50:18] whole lot give them what a whole lot to
[1:50:20] make them what believe what to church
[1:50:23] even coming to church they got to beg
[1:50:27] you and promise them that they shall
[1:50:30] have a what better Associates and
[1:50:32] everything that is not Christianity
[1:50:36] Amen brother Bram say Christianity is
[1:50:39] not what baby but Christianity is how
[1:50:42] rugged it is Christianity is not a what
[1:50:45] a hot bed place you're not somebody that
[1:50:48] they have to put fertilizer all the
[1:50:51] time Christianity is ragged amen why is
[1:50:55] he ragged you got to have a ragged
[1:50:57] training amen because your task ahead is
[1:51:00] very
[1:51:01] [Applause]
[1:51:04] serious do you think they will get
[1:51:07] somebody and bring a person to you for
[1:51:09] you to do a heart
[1:51:11] surgery even if you're a normal doctor
[1:51:15] no if you want to do heart surgery you
[1:51:17] graduated as a doctor they send you
[1:51:19] again back to school to learn again more
[1:51:23] because the area you trying to deal with
[1:51:25] is more complicated so you need another
[1:51:27] training so your training your level of
[1:51:31] graduation goes with your
[1:51:33] position my my
[1:51:35] my am am if somebody else already got
[1:51:40] their position and you still struggling
[1:51:42] maybe yours is bigger than their that's
[1:51:45] why you still going to more adverse
[1:51:50] education I don't know if you getting me
[1:51:53] somebody else got married quickly you
[1:51:55] didn't get married yet maybe yours is a
[1:51:58] little bit better they got a good
[1:52:00] marriage but yours is better you need
[1:52:03] more training before you can handle one
[1:52:06] amen I don't know if you getting me let
[1:52:08] me start it again if somebody else is
[1:52:11] blessed today and you are not blessed
[1:52:13] today maybe your blessing is bigger than
[1:52:16] this so God have to give you more
[1:52:19] advanced training amen so you can handle
[1:52:22] your
[1:52:24] they can hand but you need to handle
[1:52:26] yours amen so somebody might have a
[1:52:29] graduate degree somebody might have a
[1:52:32] doctor degree somebody might have a
[1:52:34] certificate but God is training
[1:52:37] everybody according to their future
[1:52:41] [Applause]
[1:52:43] position brother Steven what are you
[1:52:46] trying to teach with this government the
[1:52:48] Garment of a slave what is going on with
[1:52:52] this government
[1:52:53] Hallelujah if you look on the future of
[1:52:57] Joseph the Bible says this glory to God
[1:53:00] that Pharaoh say unto Joseph for as much
[1:53:03] as God has done what show thee has show
[1:53:07] thee of this there is none so discreet
[1:53:10] and wise as what thou are we're looking
[1:53:12] at the future of Joseph he's in the
[1:53:14] house of py okay we put a pause in the
[1:53:17] house of Piper we're looking where
[1:53:19] Joseph is heading okay jph didn't know
[1:53:23] this we know it because we got the whole
[1:53:26] movie now when we look at the future the
[1:53:29] bible say that shall be how over by my
[1:53:32] house over my
[1:53:34] house and according unto what Thy word
[1:53:38] shall what all my people be ruled so all
[1:53:42] Egypt will be ruled by the word amen of
[1:53:48] Joseph amen so Joseph position was to
[1:53:52] rule with the
[1:53:57] word so whatever comes out from the
[1:54:00] mouth of Joseph all Egypt must obey amen
[1:54:05] and God saw how big that position was
[1:54:09] God say I need to put him under
[1:54:11] children the Bible continue he says only
[1:54:15] in the throne so Joseph had a
[1:54:18] throne only in the throne will I be how
[1:54:22] great than thou so Joseph had a throne
[1:54:25] and according to his throne everything
[1:54:27] he said to all Egypt must come to pass
[1:54:30] if Joseph come in the morning and say
[1:54:32] none of you go to work tomorrow nobody
[1:54:34] will go to
[1:54:36] work that's right you cancel all your
[1:54:38] job said amen if Joseph come he said
[1:54:42] tomorrow everybody will stay home
[1:54:44] sleeping all of you will be sleeping do
[1:54:46] you see how dangerous that
[1:54:48] is what about if somebody is in
[1:54:50] emergency they got to take him to the
[1:54:52] Hospital Joseph said no emergency no
[1:54:54] ambulance will work
[1:54:58] today kill people the Bible says this
[1:55:03] Joseph came in Egypt as a slave amen but
[1:55:07] his position Joseph had to move from a
[1:55:14] slave into a throne when we read this we
[1:55:19] think it's easy because we watch them so
[1:55:22] much in the movie in cartoons in Jehovah
[1:55:24] Witnesses stuff we saw all those picture
[1:55:27] now we got used to it we say ah Joseph
[1:55:29] was a slave and going to the King number
[1:55:32] one he was a stranger right that's right
[1:55:35] number two he was an
[1:55:37] Abomination he was not just a slave but
[1:55:40] a slave that was stranger a slave that
[1:55:43] was an Abomination a slave that was in
[1:55:45] another country and that slave have to
[1:55:48] inherit a big position higher than
[1:55:51] anyone except Pharaoh in the Kingdom of
[1:55:54] Egypt and all Egypt will be ruled by a
[1:56:00] stranger for you to understand the level
[1:56:02] of this in the book of proverb Chapter
[1:56:05] 30 verse uh 21 Solomon say for three
[1:56:10] things the Earth is

[1:59:36] [Applause]
[1:59:40] determin Joseph a big position when he

[1:59:52] he sent a man before them even who who
[1:59:56] was sold for a what a servant that's
[1:59:58] where we are who feet they did what hurt
[2:00:01] with feathers it's combined with
[2:00:03] suffering and he was laid where in Iron
[2:00:07] do you see what he had to go through
[2:00:09] until the time there is an appointed
[2:00:11] time that his word came his prophecy the
[2:00:14] word of the Lord did what Tried Him the
[2:00:17] king sent and lose him even the ruler of
[2:00:20] what the people and let him go how free
[2:00:23] how can you free a slave that was born
[2:00:25] slave and put there amen he made him
[2:00:29] Lord of what house so they didn't just
[2:00:31] free Joseph and say okay before you
[2:00:34] interpreted the dream you can go to your
[2:00:36] country no we keep you it's a strong
[2:00:39] intelligence it's going to work for the
[2:00:42] country if he can B the cyber security
[2:00:46] we need to keep him and work with him
[2:00:48] amen somebody understand what I'm saying
[2:00:50] and he made him Lord of what his house
[2:00:53] and ruler of what all his substance to
[2:00:56] do what bind his princes at his pleasure
[2:00:59] Joseph can put you to prison if he
[2:01:02] wanted to wow do you see how danger it
[2:01:05] is so guess what if you wake up in the
[2:01:08] morning you didn't Shake Joseph hand
[2:01:10] guess what get him to the prison I will
[2:01:12] show him whom I am if you didn't smile
[2:01:15] to Joseph guess what put him to PR
[2:01:17] that's why God have to train him that's
[2:01:19] right amen amen amen because he's going
[2:01:23] to bind anyone at his pleasure he's
[2:01:26] going to be like a god that's right amen
[2:01:29] doing F the way he wanted to do amen and
[2:01:33] teach his s to what
[2:01:35] wisdom if this is the position of Joseph
[2:01:39] in the future he's going to rule Egypt
[2:01:42] by his word by his word he's going to
[2:01:45] bind princes it's not that Joseph would
[2:01:47] take somewhere I mean some feathers and
[2:01:50] go and say princess I'm going to B
[2:01:52] that's not it he rule by what word when
[2:01:55] he speak whatever he speak happen if
[2:01:58] Joseph said take him to prison Joseph
[2:02:00] will turn around and go but your
[2:02:02] destination will be prison even though
[2:02:04] it take two hours that's right for you
[2:02:07] to get to prison after two hours he will
[2:02:09] make sure you in a prison amen so the
[2:02:13] word of Joseph has a

[2:02:42] need to see you in the prison in
[2:02:44] Charlotte how long will it
[2:02:46] take it would take maybe what half an
[2:02:49] hour so sometime the command might take
[2:02:53] a
[2:02:56] [Applause]
[2:02:57] while sometime the command might be
[2:03:00] quick sometime the first squirrel will
[2:03:03] come

[2:04:37] word in other word if Joseph want to
[2:04:39] move this Pulpit he just need to

[2:25:52] unto him what I will come and heal him
[2:25:55] the Centurion answered and say Lord I am
[2:26:00] not worthy that you should this what
[2:26:02] come under my roof but do what speak the
[2:26:05] word on power of Joseph is speaking the

[2:26:55] that follow him verily I say unto you I
[2:26:57] have not found what so great
[2:27:01] faith the greatest
[2:27:04] Faith the faith of the spoken word the
[2:27:08] faith of the Gentile was
[2:27:11] decoded because somebody understood
[2:27:16] Authority
[2:27:18] [Applause]
[2:27:20] that Faith was only decoded by a
[2:27:23] military man amen no one else decoded
[2:27:27] only a military because he was already
[2:27:30] trained under Authority
[2:27:36] amen this man decoded this faith based
[2:27:41] on his natural
[2:27:44] training
[2:27:45] amen I hope we talking that I so I hope
[2:27:49] you soing that God put this man in a
[2:27:51] military camp and he being in a military
[2:27:54] Camp he learned Authority he was a man
[2:27:57] under Authority so he learned how to
[2:28:00] obey Authority and by getting that
[2:28:03] training God used that
[2:28:06] training and flip him into the spiritual
[2:28:10] amen amen and he could be able to unlock
[2:28:15] the third pool before the time of the
[2:28:18] Gentile
[2:28:23] a military home a military home a
[2:28:28] military place a discipline place is
[2:28:32] important for you to decode the third
[2:28:35] pool
[2:28:37] amen the third pool was decoded because
[2:28:41] of understanding Authority and
[2:28:47] command why did God choose only a
[2:28:50] Soldier to decode the third pool and God
[2:28:54] said none on Israel have I found this
[2:28:57] one only the soldier could be able to
[2:28:59] decode it how did he decode it because
[2:29:02] he took his natural training and from
[2:29:05] what God was training him naturally that
[2:29:08] he thought oh maybe I'm going to be just
[2:29:10] a soldier I'm a senturion now he didn't
[2:29:13] know God use that Centurion
[2:29:18] ship to bring him to the third
[2:29:21] pool God use his normal
[2:29:26] job the training that you got on your

[2:29:58] men to De call the third pool and
[2:30:00] military man to bring the holy spirit
[2:30:03] amen the first time to the Gen he drop
[2:30:06] in the in the home of a military
[2:30:10] [Applause]
[2:30:12] man why did Joseph go through a military
[2:30:18] officer the Holy Spirit fell on the
[2:30:22] Genta in a military home the first time
[2:30:24] that's
[2:30:25] right the third pool came to the Gent by

[3:01:16] discipline amen let's pray Heavenly
[3:01:19] Father Lord we are approaching you
[3:01:21] humbly this morning this afternoon
[3:01:23] father we thank you for your grace you
[3:01:26] love your mercy and for everything you
[3:01:28] have been doing for us father this is a
[3:01:31] heart searching
[3:01:32] message but there is no way that we can
[3:01:35] do it without pressing the absess to get
[3:01:39] the pass out so that your children can
[3:01:42] find Healing because you sent the word
[3:01:45] for the healing of the daughter of Zion
[3:01:47] Lord God May the Holy Spirit help each
[3:01:50] one of us go and Ponder onto these
[3:01:53] things and see what we have been doing
[3:01:57] in our
[3:01:58] homes in our work in the responsibility
[3:02:02] that we got in
[3:02:04] church in the project in the business
[3:02:07] that we have how did we handle things
[3:02:10] what was our attitude how did we react
[3:02:14] what brought us to the situation that we
[3:02:16] are here
[3:02:18] father we went through our life we
[3:02:20] thought life is growing up getting a job
[3:02:24] moving but we never understood that all
[3:02:27] those steps the prophet taught us in the
[3:02:30] message leadership that all those steps
[3:02:33] you put those steps for a reason you say
[3:02:36] there is a time a mother teaches a child
[3:02:39] and there is a time a child have to go
[3:02:40] to under a teacher in school and until
[3:02:43] he reached the point where the child get
[3:02:45] to you father we miss with didn't
[3:02:48] understand this training we were against
[3:02:50] the boss that treat us bad those that
[3:02:53] were too rigid in our life that were too
[3:02:56] straight with us we didn't like them and
[3:02:58] we didn't understand that you the one
[3:03:00] that put everything in our path because
[3:03:04] you were training us for the future Lord
[3:03:06] father position but now that you have
[3:03:09] shown unto us Lord that you even use a
[3:03:12] normal regular job to prepare us for the
[3:03:16] task that is lying ahead
[3:03:18] Lord may we be wise enough to discern to
[3:03:22] discipline to open our eyes to look at
[3:03:26] the supervisor as a mentor to look at
[3:03:30] the supervisor the manager as a tutor to
[3:03:34] look at whoever the Lord put under us as
[3:03:37] a governor that is preparing us maybe we
[3:03:41] will learn how to handle our finances
[3:03:44] from somebody like that maybe we will
[3:03:46] learn how to go to a good bank through
[3:03:49] somebody like that maybe you will use
[3:03:51] somebody on the field that Joseph never
[3:03:54] met to direct him where his brother are
[3:03:56] but we miss those stuff because we were
[3:03:59] not taught right we thought we only
[3:04:01] handle those that have the Holy Ghost
[3:04:03] that believe the message like us but
[3:04:06] father you coming to help us to
[3:04:08] understand how to handle the people in
[3:04:10] the message and outside the message so
[3:04:13] that whichever way you're going to use
[3:04:15] for the training ground we don't miss
[3:04:17] anything but may we benefit for those
[3:04:20] from those training ground so that we
[3:04:22] can be where you want us to be for the
[3:04:24] benefit of us and our family and our own
[3:04:27] life we commit everything unto their
[3:04:29] hand and father we thank you in the name
[3:04:32] of Jesus Christ amen God bless you
