[38:54] everything only in one individual but

[43:00] amen are you happy to be in the house of
[43:02] the Lord amen if you have your Bibles
[43:06] we'll go straight to the word have a
[43:08] couple of texts but we'll start in the
[43:10] Book of John chapter
[43:12] 8 and take a take a
[43:15] reading out of John chapter
[43:22] 8 amen we'll start in verse 3
[43:28] 2 amen and we'll
[43:31] read through
[43:33] 47 it said and ye shall know the truth
[43:37] yes sir and the truth shall make you
[43:39] free amen and they answered him we be
[43:43] Abraham's seed and were never in bondage
[43:45] to any man how sayest thou you shall be
[43:48] made free but Jesus answered them verily
[43:51] verily I say unto you whosoever
[43:53] committeth sin is the servant of sin and
[43:56] the servant abideth not in the house
[43:57] forever but the son abideth ever if the
[44:01] son therefore shall make you free you
[44:03] shall be free indeed and I know that you
[44:07] are Abraham's seed but you seek to kill
[44:09] me because my word hath no place in you
[44:13] I speak that which I have seen with my
[44:16] father and ye do that which you have
[44:18] seen with your father they answered and
[44:21] said unto him Abraham is Our Father and
[44:23] Jesus saith unto them if you are Abraham
[44:26] children ye would do the works of
[44:28] Abraham yes sir but now you seek to kill
[44:31] me a man that ha told you the truth
[44:33] which I have heard of God this did not
[44:35] Abraham ye do the Deeds of your father
[44:38] then said they unto him we be not born
[44:40] of fornication we have one father even
[44:43] God Jesus said unto them if God were
[44:45] your father you would love me for I
[44:48] proceeded forth and came from God
[44:50] neither came I of myself but he sent me
[44:53] why do you not understand my speech even
[44:56] because you cannot hear my word but ye
[44:59] are of your father the devil and the
[45:02] lust of your father ye will do he was a
[45:05] murderer from the beginning and a bow
[45:06] not in the truth because there is no
[45:08] truth in him when he speaketh a lie he
[45:11] speaketh of his own for he is a liar and
[45:14] the father of it and because I tell you
[45:16] the truth you believe me not which of
[45:18] you convince me of sin and I say if I
[45:20] say the truth why do you not believe me
[45:23] he that is of God heareth God's words ye
[45:26] therefore hear them not because ye are
[45:28] not of God and me one more short reading
[45:31] out of Ephesians
[45:34] 4 amen verse
[45:38] 20 down to 27 and then we'll be
[45:43] seated amen do you love the Lord amen
[45:47] amen it says but ye have not so learn
[45:50] Christ if so be that you have heard him
[45:52] and have been taught by him as the truth
[45:54] is in Jesus that you put put off
[45:56] concerning the former conversation the
[45:58] old man which is corrupt according to
[46:00] the deceitful lust and be renew renewed
[46:04] in the spirit of your mind and that you
[46:06] put on the new man which after God is
[46:08] created in righteousness and true
[46:11] Holiness wherefore putting away lying
[46:13] speak every man truth with his neighbor
[46:15] for we are members one of another be ye
[46:17] angry and sin not let not the son go
[46:20] down upon your wrath and neither give
[46:22] place to the devil amen if we could just
[46:24] bow our heads for word of
[46:26] prayer Lord we just thank you Lord for
[46:29] the opportunity to be in the house of
[46:32] God this evening father we don't want to
[46:34] take it for granted Lord any moment that
[46:37] you give us to be together father and
[46:39] gather around this revealed word Lord
[46:41] and Lord it means so much to us that you
[46:44] saw fit father to open our eyes to see
[46:47] this word and Lord to to fellowship with
[46:50] Believers of like Precious faith in this
[46:52] dark hour and we ask Lord that you pour
[46:54] out a special blessing
[46:56] upon each one father that made it out to
[46:58] the house of the Lord tonight and father
[47:01] those that couldn't make it maybe at
[47:03] home streaming father may you just go by
[47:05] their way and encourage them and
[47:07] strengthen them Father we just Commit
[47:09] This service into your hands father
[47:11] knowing that we have no ability of our
[47:12] own and just asking that you have your
[47:14] way in Jesus name amen you may have your
[47:18] seats if we could just take a text out
[47:21] of those scriptures tonight on
[47:23] overcoming the father of Lies
[47:26] o overcoming the father of Lies I mean
[47:29] and I think that's something that we can
[47:31] all agree upon tonight is that Satan is
[47:34] a liar amen he's a liar and he's the
[47:37] father of Lies am me in the church age
[47:40] book it says this is a fact Satan is a
[47:43] liar and the father of lies and and he's
[47:46] also a
[47:48] murderer and we see that expressed in in
[47:51] how brother Brandon would teach us that
[47:52] that false Vine always persecutes that
[47:55] True Vine
[47:56] how Cain would persecute Abel and Esau
[47:59] and Jacob but but he's not just a
[48:01] murderer in the natural but in the
[48:03] spiritual he's a murderer and he sent
[48:06] his doctrines into the Earth such as the
[48:08] Trinity and brother Brandon would say
[48:10] it's how it's murdered many and it's
[48:12] killed many and destroyed many lives not
[48:15] through natural death so much but as
[48:17] through spiritual death Satan has sent
[48:19] his lies and his doctrines into the
[48:22] churches and destroyed lives and
[48:25] murdered many uh innocent victims but
[48:28] but but that's what Satan does he goes
[48:30] about to steal and to kill and destroy
[48:33] and he's a he's a deceiver and and the
[48:36] Very definition of a lie would be to
[48:38] make an ontrue statement with intent to
[48:42] deceive so that's what Satan is he goes
[48:44] about as a deceiver and we shouldn't be
[48:47] surprised because it's already been
[48:49] prophesied in this last day that there
[48:51] would be false Christ and they would go
[48:53] about doing great signs and wers under a
[48:56] religious cloak but it's Satan and going
[48:59] about to deceive the true bride of
[49:02] Christ but he cannot do it because
[49:04] there's something different about them
[49:06] but Satan goes about as a liar and as
[49:09] the father of Lies seeking whom he may
[49:11] destroy uh and he goes about uh uh uh
[49:15] setting in a church pew and brother
[49:17] Brandon would say you know he wouldn't
[49:18] be a deceiver if he wasn't religious if
[49:20] he didn't go to church and dress like
[49:23] church then he wouldn't be a deceiver
[49:25] but that's what makes him a deceiver as
[49:26] he puts on that that religious spirit
[49:29] which brother brandom said is the worst
[49:31] spirit that there is five times worse
[49:33] than any other spirit that dresses
[49:36] himself up and and brother brand say how
[49:38] how they would come to the Altar and and
[49:41] maybe uh uh put on a a certain uh uh
[49:44] form or show but really they have no
[49:46] love for the Lord they have no intention
[49:49] to serve the Lord they have no order in
[49:51] their lives they get up just the same as
[49:54] they came down amen and and it could
[49:56] have been a good thing but they were
[49:58] deceived in their exper experience and
[50:00] brother BR said sometimes they get a
[50:02] church Spirit instead of God's spirit
[50:05] and what a deception of the devil to to
[50:08] to bring someone all the way into a
[50:10] church building all the way to an altar
[50:13] and not let them Reach the reality of
[50:15] the Holy Ghost but they get up with
[50:17] nothing but a church Spirit but there is
[50:20] a holy spirit there is the spirit of
[50:22] Christ and there's no comparison between
[50:25] God's spirit and this church Spirit but
[50:28] God's spirit will make you different
[50:30] brother God's spirit will come in and
[50:32] change you from the inside out it won't
[50:35] just be putting on the uh the garments
[50:37] putting the skirts past your knees and a
[50:39] set of rules and regulations it'll be a
[50:41] living reality where the king of glory
[50:44] condescends into your heart and reveals
[50:47] this message in your life and shows you
[50:49] what it's all about shows you where you
[50:52] came from shows you where you're going
[50:55] amen it's not a church Spirit you've got
[50:57] to come into the spirit of Christ amen
[51:00] but that's Satan's
[51:02] tactic amen and even in John 8 he's
[51:06] speaking this scripture to Pharisees a
[51:09] religious group of peopleall saying you
[51:12] are of your father the devil but he's a
[51:16] liar that's and how do you know he's
[51:19] lying brother Steven because his lips
[51:21] are
[51:23] moving and I don't think that's a quote
[51:25] from brother Brandon but I think it
[51:26] holds true because we just read in John
[51:28] 8 that there is no truth in him so if
[51:31] there's no truth in him and his lips are
[51:34] moving you know it's coming out as a lie
[51:37] and the thing is just to be able to
[51:38] discern who's talking to you is that
[51:41] right because if you can discern the
[51:43] voice that you're hearing and you can
[51:45] separate whether it's the lie or the
[51:47] truth then you can have dominion over
[51:49] the devil in your life and realize no
[51:52] that's not the truth that's a lie and I
[51:54] don't have to be be subject to it amen
[51:57] for that's the negative side Hallelujah
[52:00] but what about the positive side Paul
[52:02] told us in the book of Titus Paul a
[52:05] servant of God and Apostle of Jesus
[52:07] Christ according to the faith of God's
[52:10] elect and the acknowledging of the truth
[52:12] which is after godliness and hope of
[52:15] eternal life which God that cannot lie
[52:19] promised before the world began he said
[52:21] I am the way I am the truth I am the
[52:24] life and if the Satan is the father of
[52:27] lies and there's no truth in him here
[52:29] the scriptures telling us that there is
[52:31] one that dwells in truth and truth alone
[52:35] there is no lie in him and so when God
[52:38] speaks you know it's coming from the
[52:40] Throne of God it's the word of God and
[52:42] it cannot fail brother when God speaks
[52:45] it's forever when God speaks it's got to
[52:48] come to pass when God speaks all hell
[52:51] moves and it's as good as done and
[52:53] brother opposition brother friend with
[52:55] tell us means nothing when God speaks
[52:58] amen Moses might have just had a staff
[53:00] he might have just been riding into
[53:02] Egypt on the mule but he had something
[53:05] on his side he had the word of the Lord
[53:08] and when you have the word of the Lord
[53:09] on your side brother opposition doesn't
[53:11] mean a thing there is no obstacle there
[53:14] is no sickness there is no habit there
[53:17] is nothing too hard for the Lord when he
[53:20] once speaks a word over your life it is
[53:22] finished it's nothing but the truth and
[53:25] it'll
[53:26] hold it'll hold you in the hour of
[53:29] trouble amen however you came in tonight
[53:32] am me whatever you're dealing with yes
[53:34] sir it doesn't mean a thing when the
[53:36] word of the Lord yes sir strikes your
[53:40] heart it's a finished thing brother
[53:43] brother Brandon would say God's word
[53:45] would mean more in the next few minutes
[53:47] than anything he could speak because I'm
[53:50] a man and I could speak and I could tell
[53:53] a story and and you might believe it or
[53:55] not believe it but when God speaks it's
[53:57] settled when God speaks you can anchor
[54:00] your soul in that
[54:02] word amen amen amen amen hallelujah yes
[54:07] my brother and so we want the word of
[54:09] the Lord tonight yes my brother if you
[54:11] can just identify for you see Satan he's
[54:14] a perverter he's not a Creator he has no
[54:17] ability to create the way God can but
[54:20] all he can do is pervert that's right
[54:22] and so if God can speak the truth and
[54:25] Satan cannot speak that truth so what's
[54:27] he going to do he's going to take that
[54:28] truth and mistell it and then it becomes
[54:32] a lie he takes the truth of God and just
[54:35] and just perverts it and then it's it's
[54:37] just a little bit mold that's right and
[54:40] so there's going to be one of the two
[54:42] forces control us tonight it be the
[54:44] power of God or the power of the devil
[54:47] and so what are you going to yield
[54:49] yourself to is what will make the
[54:51] difference in how you leave the service
[54:52] this evening for already as you come
[54:55] come in there's different voices going
[54:57] on in your head and and and the devil's
[54:59] trying to bring one voice to to get you
[55:02] to leave the same way as you came and to
[55:04] get you get you to disbelieve the word
[55:06] of God but there's another voice the
[55:08] voice of the word that's trying to get
[55:09] you to come up higher trying to get you
[55:11] to believe for all things to believe for
[55:14] your healing to believe for your
[55:15] children to believe for your deliverance
[55:19] yes my brother Hallelujah yes my brother
[55:22] help him Lord heyen you have to forgive
[55:23] my voice PR amen and but but but if
[55:27] you're wondering what's the truth over
[55:29] your situation and you come to the house
[55:31] of God and you're hearing these voices
[55:33] in your head and you say what is the
[55:35] truth over my life and you know that
[55:38] somebody maybe you got a friend
[55:40] sometimes that that tells stories and
[55:42] they have a little bit of an ability to
[55:44] uh uh maybe if they go fishing the fish
[55:47] is always a little bit bigger than it
[55:49] really
[55:51] was and it's always a little bit
[55:53] different a little bit more exagger
[55:55] gerated just a little bit mold and so if
[55:58] you come to a serious
[56:00] situation and you ask that friend you're
[56:02] maybe going to wonder well is that the
[56:04] truth or is that a little bit mold and
[56:07] so it matters who you consult about your
[56:10] situation and what I appreciate about
[56:12] that is that one time David uh he was
[56:15] trying to do God a service and he
[56:17] consulted the captains of hundreds and
[56:20] thousands about how to get this Ark back
[56:22] into its right position and and they did
[56:25] it the way of the captains of hundreds
[56:26] and thousands and they lost the life of
[56:29] a man and it wasn't the will of God
[56:32] although although it was a good thing
[56:34] but it was trying to do God a service
[56:36] outside of his will and brother renom
[56:38] said there stood a Vindicated Prophet by
[56:40] the name of Nathan in the land and he
[56:42] wasn't even consulted amen but I believe
[56:45] we should go back to Consulting the
[56:47] Vindicated Prophet about the situation
[56:50] and if the devil tells you you're not
[56:52] going to make it you say no devil I know
[56:54] how you tell your stories they're always
[56:56] a little bit mold but I'm going to
[56:58] consult the message on this one and the
[57:00] message says I already made it the
[57:03] message says I'm already healed the
[57:05] message says I'm delivered the message
[57:07] says I'm a Son of God and I came from
[57:10] God and I don't have to Knuck down to
[57:12] the lies of the devil I don't have to
[57:14] bow down to any lie amen God's word is
[57:18] already declared victory over my life
[57:20] and it's a finished work come back to
[57:22] the absolute of this word come back to
[57:25] the truth and put a stake down and say
[57:28] it is finished it's a finished work
[57:31] Calvary paid the price the blood was
[57:33] shed the Holy Ghost is mine I can
[57:36] receive it before I ever leave this
[57:38] building I don't have to knck down to
[57:40] any lie any Spirit there is a law of
[57:44] Life flowing through my veins that says
[57:47] Amen to the word of God Amen God will
[57:51] perform what he's spoken amen he's The
[57:54] God Who performs amen if he spoke it
[57:57] he's able to perform it you don't have
[57:59] to worry about it you don't have to try
[58:01] to work it up God's word will
[58:05] manifest when it comes into the right
[58:08] ground amen but Satan hates it Satan
[58:11] hates that
[58:12] Revelation man and brother brandom told
[58:15] us that a very familiar quote he says
[58:18] exposes Satan and it Reveals His works
[58:21] the attempted destruction of God's
[58:23] people and the discrediting of God's
[58:25] word you all know where I'm at don't you
[58:28] right down to the time he's cast in the
[58:29] Lake of Fire he fights that he cannot
[58:32] stand it he knows that if the people get
[58:34] the true revelation of the true church
[58:37] how many is the true church tonight amen
[58:40] and what she is and what she stands for
[58:42] and that she can do the greater work she
[58:44] will be an invincible Army so here you
[58:47] got to discern he said if you can get a
[58:50] true revelation of the two Spirits
[58:52] within the framework of the Christian
[58:53] church and try God's by God's spirit yes
[58:57] sir discern and withstand the Antichrist
[59:01] Spirit Satan will be powerless before
[59:03] her amen and and that means something to
[59:06] me because I just been thinking a little
[59:08] bit on it it should be so easy to
[59:10] believe God's word that's right uh it
[59:13] should be so easy that if God said that
[59:16] heavens and earth shall pass away but my
[59:18] word shall never pass away and brother
[59:20] Brandon even preached a sermon on the
[59:23] infallibility of God spoken word and I
[59:26] was just thinking if if the word is
[59:27] infallible and I know it is then then
[59:30] then it should be so easy that if God
[59:33] can't lie that we should just believe
[59:35] his word amen and brother BR said if you
[59:38] could ever get it settled in your mind
[59:39] what that word really is then it would
[59:42] be settled he said you wouldn't have to
[59:44] he said you he said what that really is
[59:47] if you could ever get settled in your
[59:48] mind with that spoken word he said we
[59:50] not need any healing service our
[59:52] Salvation altar call because it would be
[59:54] finished if you just realize what that
[59:56] word was not that he was doing away with
[59:58] those things but he's just saying if you
[1:00:00] could really realize the reality of this
[1:00:02] word that you are already healed you are
[1:00:05] already delivered then it would be
[1:00:07] finished the moment you could ever
[1:00:09] realize the reality of that word that
[1:00:12] it's a finished
[1:00:13] work that it's INF it's infallible hallu
[1:00:17] that no matter if you see it today
[1:00:19] tomorrow the next day you're anchored
[1:00:22] right there in that word he said healing
[1:00:24] become simple why because it comes
[1:00:27] through a Perfection it comes through a
[1:00:29] perfect Channel it comes from God
[1:00:31] himself and it's already spoken and it
[1:00:34] can't be a mistake God doesn't take any
[1:00:37] word back for a mistake brother and when
[1:00:40] God spoke that the lamb would be slain
[1:00:42] before the foundation of the world
[1:00:44] brother there's not enough devils in
[1:00:46] hell that could keep him from dying on
[1:00:47] that cross because it was already spoken
[1:00:51] oh but don't stop there because when he
[1:00:53] wrote his name on that book he wrote my
[1:00:55] name with his and just as sure as
[1:00:57] there's not enough devils in hell that
[1:00:59] could keep him from dying on the cross
[1:01:01] there's not enough devils in hell that
[1:01:03] can keep me from fulfilling the promises
[1:01:05] spoke over my life oh because I'm a
[1:01:08] spoken word brother I'm already spoken
[1:01:10] for I'm already claimed by the blood of
[1:01:13] Jesus Christ my name is on the book
[1:01:16] before the devil could ever get to my
[1:01:18] life God already claimed me for the
[1:01:20] message of the hour and I say be it unto
[1:01:23] me Lord I don't want none of the lies of
[1:01:26] the devil give me that word over my life
[1:01:30] oh wash our minds Lord wash our minds of
[1:01:33] the filth of this world wash our minds
[1:01:36] of the perversion and the deception and
[1:01:39] give us a clean
[1:01:41] Channel
[1:01:42] Hallelujah let it settle in our hearts
[1:01:45] that it's a finished work his word will
[1:01:48] not return void and when he once speaks
[1:01:51] a word oh it's on its way it'll prosper
[1:01:55] in the thing you sent it to do and if
[1:01:57] you're a word of God you may have come
[1:02:00] in tonight dragging your feet feeling
[1:02:03] like you're withering but if you're a
[1:02:05] word of God you're not withering brother
[1:02:07] you're prospering you came from God
[1:02:10] you're on your way back to God oh don't
[1:02:12] worry about the finances don't worry
[1:02:15] about what your eyes see brother Brandon
[1:02:17] said time Insight are two of the worst
[1:02:19] enemies God has because they don't
[1:02:21] declare anything about God but if you
[1:02:24] could ever get back to the plum line of
[1:02:26] this word brother it's smooth sailing
[1:02:29] you're prospering oh because you're a
[1:02:32] word of God and you won't return void
[1:02:35] but you'll manifest that attribute of
[1:02:38] God hallelujah let the word settle your
[1:02:42] hearts tonight that it's a finished work
[1:02:46] oh Satan hates it but we love it we love
[1:02:50] this
[1:02:51] Revelation
[1:02:52] Hallelujah you got to let that truth be
[1:02:56] your guard let that truth be your
[1:02:59] protection oh you're in the greatest
[1:03:01] battle ever fought you come into church
[1:03:04] tonight and you're in a battle a battle
[1:03:07] between right and wrong a battle between
[1:03:09] truth and the lie but God's given you a
[1:03:12] word to be your guard glory to God Amen
[1:03:16] and brother if you can recognize that
[1:03:18] it's a lie you can take the devil back
[1:03:20] to that word and say Satan it wasn't so
[1:03:23] from the beginning because if God
[1:03:25] promised it in the beginning and Satan
[1:03:27] says sure that's that's about right
[1:03:29] except it's for a days gone by then
[1:03:32] that's a thief that's come to steal and
[1:03:35] kill and Rob you of your god-given
[1:03:38] privileges anything contrary to God's
[1:03:41] word it's a thief and it's come to rob
[1:03:44] you it's come to destroy you oh but you
[1:03:48] can let this word be your card amen I
[1:03:51] like what brother Brandon teaches us yes
[1:03:54] on the
[1:03:56] baptism in the name of the father Son
[1:03:58] and Holy Ghost how it was the same name
[1:04:02] how it wasn't titles like they taught it
[1:04:05] that it was three different people but
[1:04:07] it was three different offices and
[1:04:09] brother Brandon would say that there
[1:04:10] stood Matthew there as a guard for that
[1:04:12] sacred baptism that we didn't have to
[1:04:15] wonder about it but there was the answer
[1:04:17] laying there in Matthew as a guard and
[1:04:20] and brother talked about how he put
[1:04:22] those four powers of the line and the ox
[1:04:25] the man amen and the eagle to guard the
[1:04:28] Acts of the Apostles there were those
[1:04:30] gospels that stood as guard brother amen
[1:04:33] and that truth can be your guard you
[1:04:36] take this word and when Satan comes in
[1:04:39] brother you're guarded you can stand
[1:04:42] there and say no no he said you're going
[1:04:44] to go you're going to go to a grave and
[1:04:46] you're never going to come up but God
[1:04:48] already promised us that there would be
[1:04:50] a resurrection that there would be a
[1:04:53] Rapture and we guarded by that word all
[1:04:56] Satan's lies have no penetration because
[1:05:00] it's the
[1:05:01] word amen but it's the greatest battle
[1:05:05] ever fought but it's fought in the mind
[1:05:07] and why is it fought in the mind because
[1:05:09] that's where decisions are made brother
[1:05:11] and so Satan chose that mind but Joshua
[1:05:14] could say choose you this day who you
[1:05:16] will serve will you serve the gods or
[1:05:18] those on the other side of the flood or
[1:05:21] will you Ser serve the true and living
[1:05:23] God
[1:05:25] those choices are made every day yes sir
[1:05:27] where you accept doubt or faith and
[1:05:31] brother Brandon said Satan began at the
[1:05:33] principal part that caused the spirit of
[1:05:35] man to doubt God's word but God began in
[1:05:38] the principal part to lay his word in
[1:05:42] that spirit amen do you see the Warfare
[1:05:45] happening even now Satan's there laying
[1:05:48] in that lie laying in that lie but God's
[1:05:51] got a word that's being laid in and laid
[1:05:53] in and choose you this day will you put
[1:05:56] the word first or will you put the LIE
[1:05:58] of the enemy first but as for me in my
[1:06:01] house we choose the word of the lord we
[1:06:04] choose this truth of the hour oh he'll
[1:06:08] try to come in through your five senses
[1:06:11] of
[1:06:12] imagination conscience and and memory
[1:06:14] and you think I'm not good enough I I'll
[1:06:17] never make it and you begin to reason
[1:06:19] that maybe it's not for me maybe uh
[1:06:22] maybe uh I've made too many mistakes and
[1:06:25] I've fallen too many times and and Satan
[1:06:28] begins to work on those things but
[1:06:30] you're not alone if I could just share
[1:06:33] brother brandom had us had had had those
[1:06:36] same battles how Satan would attack his
[1:06:38] mind right and he would tell about how
[1:06:41] one time he was driving down the road
[1:06:42] and he was listening to a broadcast and
[1:06:45] the way he describes it it was uh as if
[1:06:47] they were talking about something kind
[1:06:48] of like Evolution and he said there is
[1:06:51] no such thing and he begins to talk
[1:06:53] about it he said but Satan was trying to
[1:06:55] punch that at me and after I had taken
[1:06:58] my little Rebecca to school this morning
[1:07:00] and on the road back I started to turn
[1:07:02] the radio on again and I thought I would
[1:07:03] get into that stuff again so I just
[1:07:05] turned it back off there's a big key
[1:07:08] over coming right there just turn it
[1:07:11] back off I tell my brother oh don't stop
[1:07:14] for the devil just turn it back off
[1:07:17] don't give the devil a place neither
[1:07:19] give a place to the devil don't give him
[1:07:23] room to even come into your mind oh but
[1:07:26] he said Satan said to me he said do you
[1:07:29] know this man that you call Jesus was
[1:07:32] just a man like one day in his day like
[1:07:35] Billy Graham or Oral Roberts he was just
[1:07:37] a man and Satan begins to lay this lie
[1:07:40] into his conscience but brother Bram
[1:07:42] said I thought how a liar you are he
[1:07:44] said and then I turned just as I was
[1:07:46] crossing Graham Street I said Satan you
[1:07:48] that's talking to my conscience see how
[1:07:51] that Devil's coming in through that
[1:07:52] sense he said I like to ask you a few
[1:07:54] things who was it that the Hebrew
[1:07:56] Prophet spoke of that would come who was
[1:07:59] the anointed Messiah what was upon those
[1:08:02] men who fora him and told his life
[1:08:04] thousands of years before he got here
[1:08:06] who was it that foretold it just to the
[1:08:08] letter and he begins to combat that
[1:08:10] Devil with the word and brother said you
[1:08:13] might as well just get away from it
[1:08:14] because it's written in the word and
[1:08:15] every word is true then he left just
[1:08:18] give him the word that doesn't he can't
[1:08:20] stand that word for it's inspired and
[1:08:24] brother Paul taught us to think on these
[1:08:26] things that negative thought comes in
[1:08:29] that says you're too far gone you're
[1:08:31] never going to make it that it couldn't
[1:08:33] possibly be you brother you can't stop
[1:08:36] that bird from flying over but you can't
[1:08:38] stop it from building a nest you take
[1:08:40] that word and you blast it away and said
[1:08:42] no Satan you're a liar it is for me and
[1:08:46] brother you're supposed to cast down
[1:08:48] imaginations and cast down everything
[1:08:51] that exalteth itself against the
[1:08:53] knowledge of God God and you don't have
[1:08:55] to be a slave to that lie anymore cast
[1:08:58] it down am mean everything that exalteth
[1:09:01] itself against the knowledge of God
[1:09:04] glory and When God says I know the
[1:09:05] thoughts I think towards you thoughts of
[1:09:07] peace and not of evil to give you an
[1:09:09] expected end you going to take the
[1:09:11] knowledge of God or you going to take
[1:09:13] the LIE of the devil did you come from
[1:09:15] God does he have good thoughts towards
[1:09:17] you does he know you as his son does he
[1:09:20] know you as his child then what are you
[1:09:22] going to believe when the the Devil
[1:09:24] comes in and tells you it's not so oh
[1:09:26] but brother think on these things cast
[1:09:29] down
[1:09:30] imaginations oh brother brother Brandon
[1:09:33] was in South Africa one time and there
[1:09:36] was a mighty Miracle took place with a
[1:09:38] boy who was under a a mental spirit that
[1:09:41] was causing them to be on all fours like
[1:09:43] an animal but God delivered them and
[1:09:45] brother Brandon made a call for
[1:09:47] salvation he said you who are tired of
[1:09:49] serving those Idols why don't you throw
[1:09:52] them down on the ground he said it was
[1:09:53] like a dust storm where 30,000 raw
[1:09:55] heathens cast down their idols and you
[1:09:58] say well I don't have any Idols in my
[1:10:00] life but brother Brenham said anything
[1:10:02] between you and God is an idol amen and
[1:10:05] every thought that exalteth itself
[1:10:08] between you and God it's an idol and you
[1:10:10] have a right tonight to cast it down and
[1:10:13] you don't have to live with it anymore
[1:10:15] it's an idol and what agreement have the
[1:10:17] temple of God with Idols you are the
[1:10:20] Temple of the Living God you are not a
[1:10:22] temple for the 's Idols you are not a
[1:10:25] temple for those things which would get
[1:10:28] between you and you and God my brother
[1:10:31] said come out from among them and be ye
[1:10:34] separate touch not the unclean thing and
[1:10:36] I will receive you you're a separated
[1:10:39] people you've been called come out of
[1:10:41] her my people come out of
[1:10:43] denominations oh and I don't care if you
[1:10:45] sit in a message church that's not what
[1:10:47] I'm talking about come out of the
[1:10:49] denominational mentality that you're a
[1:10:51] slave to some system and it's just rules
[1:10:54] and regulations if I don't wear my skirt
[1:10:57] so long if I don't speak in tongues I
[1:10:59] don't have the Holy Ghost God has called
[1:11:01] us to a liberty this message is our
[1:11:04] Liberty this message is our truth don't
[1:11:06] bring your denominational chains into
[1:11:09] this message Hallelujah said this is the
[1:11:11] word now and if it doesn't agree with
[1:11:14] the word throw it out brother am cast It
[1:11:17] Down cast down that
[1:11:20] imagination cast it down and come out
[1:11:22] from among them yes my brother oh you

[1:11:26] hallelujah hallelujah oh anything that
[1:11:29] exalted against the knowledge of God

[1:11:38] the word now amen and you should let
[1:11:41] God's word be true amen amen and every
[1:11:43] man yes sir a liar a you don't have to
[1:11:47] be captive Hallelujah bring it under
[1:11:49] captivity to the word oh praise God you
[1:11:52] have the message amen don't stop amen
[1:11:55] don't stop as Eve would stop for a
[1:11:59] moment but but we're under a commission
[1:12:01] like Joshua don't turn to the right or
[1:12:03] the left hallelujah oh keep that word of
[1:12:05] the Lord in your mouth Joshua he didn't
[1:12:08] just say keep it in his hand or or keep
[1:12:10] it on his lap but he said keep it in
[1:12:12] your mouth don't let it ever depart from
[1:12:14] your mouth don't let that word ever
[1:12:17] depart from your mouth but may it always
[1:12:19] be on display amen amen amen always be
[1:12:23] What comes forth from your
[1:12:25] lips brother don't stop for a
[1:12:28] moment as brother Brandon would give the
[1:12:30] example of Nelly Sanders stopping to
[1:12:32] turn over to that that dance hall and he
[1:12:35] said that's where she made her mistake
[1:12:37] thinking that it wouldn't bother anymore
[1:12:39] but it did bother her and she shouldn't
[1:12:42] have stopped that's right but brother BR
[1:12:44] said don't stop for nothing you've got
[1:12:46] the message Jesus Lives God Is A Healer
[1:12:49] that's the message don't stop for
[1:12:50] nothing no reasonings no nothing else
[1:12:56] and brother Brandon would preach the
[1:12:57] message recognizing your day and its
[1:12:59] message yes my brother and he said you
[1:13:01] know I had so much trouble getting the
[1:13:03] inspiration for the service and and it
[1:13:06] just wouldn't come and then when it
[1:13:07] finally started coming he said Satan
[1:13:09] would tell me you feel too bad your
[1:13:11] head's hurting you're sick and and you
[1:13:14] can't go down there you can't stand
[1:13:16] there and and brother Brandon began to
[1:13:17] recite the story of that little cocky
[1:13:20] boy from England he said I've got an
[1:13:22] Urgent Message and I need you to take it
[1:13:25] and I'm going to give you my scepter and
[1:13:27] to show you that that you're the king's
[1:13:29] messenger carrying a Vindicated word and
[1:13:33] brother BR said I thought Satan get out
[1:13:34] of my way I have the king's message I
[1:13:37] must go and then he talks about Jesus
[1:13:39] Christ raising from the dead as the
[1:13:41] Prince of Peace coming forth with the
[1:13:43] Declaration I am the king's message I
[1:13:46] must come forth to prove this
[1:13:48] Resurrection I am the resurrection of in
[1:13:50] life am amen and when God gives you the
[1:13:53] this message brother don't stop don't
[1:13:55] turn to the right or the left don't stop
[1:13:57] for nothing don't stop for any other
[1:14:00] voice don't stop for any other opinion
[1:14:03] brother you have the message move
[1:14:05] forward don't stop don't turn to the
[1:14:08] right or the left but we're going
[1:14:10] forward and we're going upward and it's
[1:14:13] becoming of you to fulfill our
[1:14:15] righteousness brother it's becoming of
[1:14:17] you to stand for this word it's becoming
[1:14:20] of you now in the time of difficulty to
[1:14:22] stand
[1:14:23] and fulfill this word man when brother
[1:14:26] Brandon preached that service it
[1:14:28] becometh us to fulfill our righteousness
[1:14:31] it got a call that his mother was was
[1:14:33] close to death in the hospital a and how
[1:14:36] a hard thing that would be can you
[1:14:38] imagine but he said but here is a
[1:14:40] message that's got to go on lord it's
[1:14:43] becoming to us it's becoming to me now
[1:14:45] that I fulfill all righteousness God's
[1:14:48] word comes first and then down he said
[1:14:51] Lord and as your servant I charge this
[1:14:53] devil that's pushed at me all morning
[1:14:56] that's tried to make me get out of this
[1:14:58] Pulpit by the grace of God I stayed here
[1:15:00] for these poor sick and suffering
[1:15:02] Mortals amen and how the devil will come
[1:15:05] and how he'll try to use difficulties to
[1:15:07] push you out of your position to try to
[1:15:09] push you out of your position as a
[1:15:11] pastor as the Deacon as the lay member

[1:18:25] I'll stand for him my brother I'll stand
[1:18:27] for this truth don't stop neither give
[1:18:30] place to the devil oh that's the problem
[1:18:34] we make too many homes for the
[1:18:36] devil oh someone preach my someone says
[1:18:39] something to you someone says something
[1:18:41] that gets a little bit on your nerves
[1:18:43] brother and all of a sudden you you get
[1:18:45] out your best comforter you get out your
[1:18:48] best bed your best pillows and you say
[1:18:51] here's a nice place for you
[1:18:53] and you let a little bitterness become a
[1:18:55] great big bitterness and you let a
[1:18:58] little a little uh offense become a
[1:19:00] great big my brother you let a little
[1:19:03] fear become a great big fear because you
[1:19:05] gave it a place but you don't have to
[1:19:07] give a place to the devil tonight you
[1:19:10] can kick them out and say this is the
[1:19:12] Temple of the Lord what agreement have
[1:19:15] the Temple of the Lord with Idols there
[1:19:17] is no agreement someone's going to give
[1:19:20] place to the word give place to the word
[1:19:23] that it might be made flesh in your life
[1:19:26] and yield yourself as instruments of
[1:19:29] righteousness what you what are you
[1:19:30] going to yield yourself
[1:19:32] toen because Satan is almost helpless
[1:19:35] without somebody to get into oh but so
[1:19:38] is the Lord depending on us so is the
[1:19:41] Lord depending on Humanity that he could
[1:19:44] get into and work through oh but what
[1:19:46] are you going to yield yourself
[1:19:48] to if if Hitler could yield himself to
[1:19:51] what he did and and look at what what
[1:19:54] what was Satan was able to accomplish
[1:19:56] through his life and and you look at
[1:19:58] Judas and and and Elvis Presley and what
[1:20:02] they yielded themselves to and what the
[1:20:04] Lord what Satan was able to accomplish
[1:20:07] through their lives but what about the
[1:20:10] positive what about somebody like Luther
[1:20:13] that could yield himself and and bring
[1:20:15] forth a message of justification and
[1:20:18] Wesley could bring forth sanctification
[1:20:20] and and brother brandom could yield
[1:20:22] himself and bring forth this great end
[1:20:24] time message and you take uh ones like
[1:20:27] your pastor that could yields and God
[1:20:30] could use them uh to begin to establish
[1:20:32] a church that would stand for the truth
[1:20:35] and you might yield yourself and BR
[1:20:36] brother don't worry so much about what
[1:20:38] you're going to do when you yield
[1:20:40] yourself just focus on yielding yourself
[1:20:43] and when you yield yourself one might go
[1:20:45] to preaching one might go to shouting
[1:20:47] one might go to seeing visions one might
[1:20:50] go to dancing don't worry about what
[1:20:52] you're going to do when
[1:20:53] your just yield yourself as an
[1:20:55] instrument of rightous and let the Lord
[1:20:57] take care of what's going to happen and
[1:20:59] God will place you where you're meant to
[1:21:01] be as a son or daughter of God you just
[1:21:04] let go stop trying to war with it Lord
[1:21:07] Lord what is my position you're anxious
[1:21:09] you're worried about what you're
[1:21:11] supposed to do but brother yield
[1:21:12] yourself to the Lord and let him use you
[1:21:15] for what he's called you to oh you don't
[1:21:17] have to worry about the details oh stop
[1:21:19] letting that anxious mind control your
[1:21:22] life and yield yourself to the spirit of
[1:21:24] the Lord and say Lord here I am be it
[1:21:27] unto me according to your word oh and
[1:21:30] let me be an instrument of righteousness
[1:21:34] oh God will take care of it God will
[1:21:36] take care of your future God will take
[1:21:38] care of your position He he'll lead you
[1:21:40] to an instrument he'll lead you to the
[1:21:42] front row he'll lead you to the sound
[1:21:44] booth I don't know where he's going to
[1:21:46] lead you but just let him lead let the
[1:21:49] God come into your life and Lead You In
[1:21:52] all rightous
[1:21:53] let him lead you through this message
[1:21:55] let him lead you at your school let him
[1:21:57] lead you in your home oh let the spirit
[1:22:00] of Truth lead you into all truth oh he's
[1:22:04] a guide oh he's not going to just beat
[1:22:07] you up and and pull you through on a
[1:22:10] chain he's going to lead
[1:22:13] you oh and know my voice oh they're led
[1:22:17] by the spirit
[1:22:21] hallelujah oh you say well I just come
[1:22:24] with an open
[1:22:25] mind but that's the problem sometimes
[1:22:28] brother Brandon say with these churches
[1:22:30] and their open mind has allowed them to
[1:22:32] receive all kinds of Creeds and dogmas
[1:22:35] so you don't necessarily want to come
[1:22:36] with a a blank mind as it were but come
[1:22:39] in your right mind because the mind is
[1:22:41] the womb to the spirit and there's a
[1:22:44] physical womb and a spiritual womb and
[1:22:47] but it starts in the mind the mind is
[1:22:49] the womb of the spirit the mind is where
[1:22:52] the first act takes
[1:22:54] place and we see that in the natural
[1:22:56] because the Bible said whosoever lookth
[1:22:58] upon a woman to lust after her showing
[1:23:00] that the First Act takes place in the
[1:23:01] mind uh but that also applies to the
[1:23:05] spiritual and that's how you can let in
[1:23:07] either a creat or a Dogma by refusing
[1:23:10] the word for a lie in your mind but
[1:23:13] brother though it has a negative there's
[1:23:15] also a positive and that's the same
[1:23:18] channel that you're born again by the
[1:23:20] Holy Ghost is that you take that word in
[1:23:23] your mind and you begin to receive it
[1:23:25] and it drops in your spirit and life
[1:23:28] comes down that channel and brings that
[1:23:30] word in the
[1:23:32] manifestation oh
[1:23:34] every every infallible word of God in
[1:23:38] the right ground will manifest itself
[1:23:41] amen did not the Bible say in John 5 he
[1:23:44] that heareth my words and believeth on
[1:23:47] him that sent me ha eternal life and
[1:23:49] shall not come into the Judgment but has
[1:23:51] passed from Death on the life you hear
[1:23:54] the word and you believe it oh and it
[1:23:57] finds a place to
[1:23:59] rest and brother brandom I never noticed
[1:24:01] this till the other day go ahead brother
[1:24:03] but he talks about maybe it's not not
[1:24:06] not necessarily in concrete but he said
[1:24:08] you know by commentaries we know that
[1:24:11] the blind prophetess an was Mary's
[1:24:14] mother and I don't know if that's true
[1:24:16] or not but brother Brandon mentions it
[1:24:18] and the spoken word is the Original Seed
[1:24:21] and so isn't that something
[1:24:23] that there was a blind woman oh but she
[1:24:25] couldn't see with her natural eyes but
[1:24:27] she said she would take that Isaiah 96
[1:24:30] and she would begin to seow that seed
[1:24:32] over Mary's life a virgin shall conceive
[1:24:35] and bring forth a son oh and that word
[1:24:38] be to be sewed in that mind of Mary and
[1:24:41] as that prophecy circled the Earth there
[1:24:44] was good ground for it to fall into that
[1:24:47] she could say be it unto me that word
[1:24:49] had been circulating in her mind but one
[1:24:52] day dropped from her head to her heart
[1:24:54] and brought forth the manifested word oh
[1:24:57] it can't just be in your head he said a
[1:25:00] lie detector won't work on your mind it
[1:25:02] works on your soul and so if you say in
[1:25:04] your head that it's the truth but in the
[1:25:07] heart there's a demon doubting that word
[1:25:10] it's not going to work but if you could
[1:25:11] ever get that mind and that soul in
[1:25:14] harmony with the word it'll be banging
[1:25:16] on all cylinders it'll bring forth
[1:25:19] exactly what it said oh because there's
[1:25:21] a Harmony amen but that was Eve's
[1:25:26] problem that she stopped for a moment
[1:25:29] for that word of the enemy to come down
[1:25:32] in her in her her mind and then to lead
[1:25:36] her to stop and be deceived that first
[1:25:38] lie was ever told you shall not surely
[1:25:42] die but brother BR said it's like it's
[1:25:45] like something that's 95% right he said
[1:25:48] if you're talking about this service and
[1:25:50] we come in the church he said they was
[1:25:51] at the Tabernacle up here at the certain
[1:25:53] night the people all gathered in they
[1:25:56] sang hymns and the minister spoke and
[1:25:58] then you know what they passed the
[1:26:00] bottle around and all of them got drunk
[1:26:02] he said wrong see he said just the
[1:26:06] spirit fell down they all got drunk it's
[1:26:09] just that much difference they did
[1:26:11] stagger they did fall they did cut up
[1:26:14] but there wasn't a bottle that did it it
[1:26:17] was the Holy Ghost confirming his word
[1:26:18] with signs following and so then he say
[1:26:21] see that's the way with unbeliever the
[1:26:23] unidentified person with God who'll say
[1:26:25] oh I believe Jesus Christ is the Son of
[1:26:27] God I believe God is the father of Jesus
[1:26:30] Christ I believe all these other things
[1:26:33] see but when it comes down to this other
[1:26:35] part that's for another day when I'm
[1:26:37] reading this for a reason he said
[1:26:39] there's the LIE of it that's right he's
[1:26:41] trying to twist a little of the right
[1:26:43] word around to make it deceiving to the
[1:26:45] people but then he said what Jesus made
[1:26:48] the thing clear amen he said these
[1:26:50] shines shall confirm the message that I
[1:26:53] have and I love that so much brother
[1:26:55] Jesus makes the thing clear he doesn't
[1:26:58] make it confusing he's not the author of
[1:27:00] confusion if the devil has sod his
[1:27:03] doctrines of of all kinds of ridiculous
[1:27:06] things that don't line up with the word
[1:27:07] at all and it's clear as mud but God
[1:27:10] sent this message to tie the loose ends
[1:27:13] together that you wouldn't have to walk
[1:27:14] in confusion no more but you could walk
[1:27:17] in Clarity you could walk in Clarity of
[1:27:19] the scripture where those Muddy Waters
[1:27:22] were made clear and you could see
[1:27:24] clearly what he's talking about you
[1:27:26] could see clearly the godhead You Could
[1:27:28] See Clearly the serpent seed You Could
[1:27:30] See Clearly who you were amen oh that's
[1:27:34] the LIE of the devil that's right oh but
[1:27:36] God makes things clearl amen oh God
[1:27:40] makes things clear but here the devil
[1:27:42] said yes sir the lie that Satan told Eve
[1:27:46] he didn't mean what he said he didn't
[1:27:49] mean it see how he whitewashed the word
[1:27:52] now God said it but he didn't meet it he
[1:27:54] said that same rotten lie is told by
[1:27:56] Satan to preachers and church members
[1:27:58] today the word of God says so and so but
[1:28:01] it doesn't mean that but the Bible said
[1:28:03] a little leav Lev's the whole lump and
[1:28:06] brother said it's got to be perfectly
[1:28:08] right or it isn't right at all and if
[1:28:11] one part can be right then brother it'll
[1:28:13] lead to an instable home it'll lead to
[1:28:15] an instable family because you'll be
[1:28:17] like have we trusted the wrong thing if
[1:28:20] one thing could be wrong couldn't all be
[1:28:22] wrong but no brother that's that old
[1:28:24] Palmer worm that's come in he's trying
[1:28:26] to eat the faith in the word he's trying
[1:28:28] to eat at your faith and say oh uh this
[1:28:31] Bible's been it's been interpreted so
[1:28:33] many times how could it be true that's
[1:28:36] that old Palmer worm devil that's come
[1:28:37] in to eat your faith but this word came
[1:28:40] from God in the beginning was the word
[1:28:43] and the Word was with God and the Word
[1:28:44] was God and it says the prophecy came
[1:28:47] not in all time by the will of man but
[1:28:49] holy men of God spake as they were
[1:28:52] removed by the Holy Ghost it's a devil
[1:28:54] trying to lead you to an instability
[1:28:56] that maybe it's not right maybe it won't
[1:28:59] hold me in the time of trouble but it's
[1:29:01] a lie it's nothing but the truth it's
[1:29:04] nothing but the word yes my brother oh
[1:29:07] see Satan's tact tactic is to destroy
[1:29:10] the influence of something brother said
[1:29:13] if the devil could ever get the deity
[1:29:15] out of the name of Jesus he have the
[1:29:17] church whipped oh he's not coming to
[1:29:20] take the name of Jesus he's only come
[1:29:22] for the deity and he also said if Satan
[1:29:24] can just destroy the influence of the
[1:29:26] message he's got it whipped he's not
[1:29:29] come maybe to just take the whole
[1:29:30] message he's just come to destroy its
[1:29:32] influence so that you can't trust it
[1:29:35] with everything you can't trust it for
[1:29:37] your family you can't trust it for your
[1:29:39] loved ones you can't trust it in the
[1:29:41] hour of trouble oh but it's a lie of the
[1:29:44] devil amen amen amen it's nothing but a
[1:29:46] lie brother brandom said what if I said
[1:29:48] that I would come into this meeting and
[1:29:51] there would be a crippled woman and we
[1:29:53] lay our hands on her and she'd recover
[1:29:56] what if I said that there would be a
[1:29:57] Waterhead baby and as soon as we prayed
[1:29:59] the baby's head was going normal what if
[1:30:02] I said that four men in dark suits would
[1:30:04] be bearing a dead man and as soon as
[1:30:06] prayers offered his Spirit returns and
[1:30:08] then there comes your 5-year-old brother
[1:30:10] killed on the street you bring him to me
[1:30:13] I'll be standing by a doorstep and
[1:30:14] there's a man with a light suit on I'll
[1:30:16] be speaking to him and your little
[1:30:18] brother's going to be whole now he said
[1:30:20] what if that first woman comes and and
[1:30:23] she's not healed what if that water head
[1:30:26] baby comes and she's not healed then
[1:30:28] when it comes to your little brother
[1:30:29] brother the influence is lost you're
[1:30:32] you're scared to death that he's not
[1:30:34] going to be healed he said but what if
[1:30:36] it is there what if the woman is healed
[1:30:39] what if the Waterhead baby is healed and
[1:30:41] brother Brandon begins to lay these
[1:30:43] things in then when you comes to your
[1:30:44] brother you're not worried at all you
[1:30:47] just say praise God we're fixing to see
[1:30:49] a miracle anden and brother said now
[1:30:52] we're at the time of the Rapture it's
[1:30:54] going to happen because it's been
[1:30:56] perfect every other time and it's got to
[1:30:59] be perfect this time God is calling out
[1:31:02] a people oh and in having conferences he
[1:31:05] said I tell the truth in Christ I lie
[1:31:07] not there's no man can take the doctrine
[1:31:09] that I preach and disprove it there's no
[1:31:12] one can do it I've never seen anyone
[1:31:14] could do it it's the gospel truth the
[1:31:17] discernments of the spirit is perfect no
[1:31:19] man can ever say it's not been perfect
[1:31:22] and I'll tell you now there's a perfect
[1:31:24] place a perfect heaven a perfect God a
[1:31:27] perfect savior a perfect blood a perfect
[1:31:29] atonement a perfect being for you and we
[1:31:32] say we're resting on that amen there's
[1:31:35] enough influence in this message that
[1:31:38] it'll hold you and if it was enough to
[1:31:40] save you if it was enough to deliver you
[1:31:43] if it was enough to fill you with the
[1:31:44] Holy Ghost isn't there enough influence
[1:31:47] there that power of influence resonating
[1:31:50] that says it's enough to change my body
[1:31:52] am can you trust it enough to give your
[1:31:55] life to it are you willing to give your
[1:31:58] life for this message yes my brother oh
[1:32:01] yes my brother and maybe not just
[1:32:03] naturally but are you willing to Die
[1:32:05] daily for this message are you willing
[1:32:07] to give your opinions for this message
[1:32:09] are you willing to give every thought
[1:32:11] that's contrary to this word that you
[1:32:13] could be that pure bride that spoken
[1:32:16] word seed bride that would manifest
[1:32:18] Jesus Christ on this Earth again that
[1:32:21] says Be unto me oh Mary did what Eve
[1:32:24] didn't do she received that word into
[1:32:27] her heart and there was an agreement
[1:32:29] there was a Harmony and brother there's
[1:32:31] power in harmony there's power in
[1:32:34] agreeing with this word brother Mary
[1:32:36] could say be it on to me and that life
[1:32:39] would take hold oh what about hady right
[1:32:43] oh when brother Brandon's telling about
[1:32:45] that that Jehovah Gyra that could speak
[1:32:48] squirrels and she said it's nothing but
[1:32:50] the truth I believe that just came from
[1:32:52] her mind I believe that came from her
[1:32:54] heart and then that power of Harmony
[1:32:57] that come forth of voice howy ask what
[1:32:59] you will and it'll be done unto you
[1:33:02] right and then brother Brandon want to
[1:33:03] talk about how that right family would
[1:33:05] get up and give testimony in the church
[1:33:07] he said the blessings has never left
[1:33:09] that home brother if you want to see
[1:33:11] blessings visit your home start walking
[1:33:13] in harmony with this word start putting
[1:33:16] this word above everything else and
[1:33:18] watch the blessings visit your home oh
[1:33:21] you begin to agree with this word until
[1:33:24] you can ask what you will yes oh it's
[1:33:27] until this word says by a Stripes I am
[1:33:30] healed your mind grasp it and said by a
[1:33:32] Stripes I am healed the soul grasp it
[1:33:35] and says by a Stripes I am healed
[1:33:37] brother you're going somewhere then that
[1:33:40] word has found a place to take hold oh
[1:33:43] give place to the word of the hour give
[1:33:45] place to the promises of
[1:33:47] God oh May a Spirit of Harmony sweep
[1:33:51] through this building and begin to tie
[1:33:53] this word to your mind to your soul and
[1:33:56] begin to lift you out of your current
[1:33:58] condition you don't have to be a slave
[1:34:00] to that lie anymore oh you served that
[1:34:03] devil long enough he which the son has
[1:34:05] made free is free indeed oh you don't
[1:34:07] have to bow down to that Idol but like
[1:34:10] Daniel oh determine in your heart I'm
[1:34:13] going to stay with the word I will not
[1:34:16] bow to the enemy amen amen amen am amen
[1:34:19] prach my oh there's a word yes sir this
[1:34:23] word every link forms a chain right and
[1:34:27] it's holding you over hell brother say
[1:34:30] and it's only as strong as it's weakest
[1:34:32] link oh that's why you can't add to it
[1:34:35] that's why you can't take it away that's
[1:34:37] why it does make a difference whether
[1:34:39] it's the word or not that's right oh
[1:34:42] Satan told Eve it doesn't make a
[1:34:43] difference oh but but it does make a
[1:34:46] difference it does make a difference oh
[1:34:47] would you jump off a cliff if your
[1:34:49] friend did I hope not and would you
[1:34:53] disagree with this word because your
[1:34:55] neighbor out in the world didn't know
[1:34:57] you're a different people you're a
[1:34:59] separated people you're not the church
[1:35:01] you're the bride you're a separated onto
[1:35:04] the word of the Lord You're called onto
[1:35:07] this holy Union with the word how can
[1:35:09] two walk together except they be agreed
[1:35:12] but you're not called to walk with your
[1:35:13] neighbor down the street you're not
[1:35:15] called to walk with the devil you're
[1:35:17] called to walk with this word and the
[1:35:19] bride can walk with the word because she
[1:35:21] is the word and the word connects with
[1:35:24] word life connects with life and it
[1:35:27] brings you back into a
[1:35:29] fellowship oh that it looks impossible
[1:35:32] sometimes brother Steven how could we
[1:35:34] keep every word how could we possibly
[1:35:37] hold that chain together with our own
[1:35:39] ability but God made a way to breed back
[1:35:43] a bride to breed back a people through a
[1:35:46] perfect blood oh he said I'll put en
[1:35:49] enity between my seed thy seed and her
[1:35:52] seed but Eve didn't have a seed she was
[1:35:54] a woman but it was speaking of a savior
[1:35:57] it was speaking of Christ the seed that
[1:36:00] would come forth and shed his perfect
[1:36:02] blood to breed back a people that could
[1:36:05] be filled with his spirit that they
[1:36:07] would have the truth again dwelling in
[1:36:10] human vessels oh you in your own ability
[1:36:13] couldn't do it but God has bred back of
[1:36:15] people with a non-adulterated faith in
[1:36:18] the word that they wouldn't add to the
[1:36:20] word or take from word oh but he sent
[1:36:23] back his Spirit there's a spoken word
[1:36:25] seed Bride on the earth oh that is bone
[1:36:28] of his bone flesh of his flesh oh being
[1:36:32] of his being oh she is him she is him
[1:36:38] Jesus Christ manifested in flesh again
[1:36:40] on the earth brother we're not looking
[1:36:43] for it it's here it's come in its
[1:36:46] infancy but it's growing forth in the
[1:36:48] full manifestation till one day the
[1:36:51] ministry of Jesus Christ will be so like
[1:36:54] it was when he was here on Earth that it
[1:36:56] will call forth those loved ones from
[1:36:57] the grave to a resurrection that's right
[1:37:00] oh it's a uniting time it's uniting with
[1:37:03] the word the fellowship that Eve left
[1:37:06] off oh he's bred you back to the Holy
[1:37:09] Spirit hallelujah oh it seems impossible
[1:37:12] except a man be born again yes sir oh
[1:37:15] and God could place the spirit of Truth
[1:37:17] in an individual that the only way for
[1:37:20] truth to come come back Hallelujah would
[1:37:23] be through that you could speak the
[1:37:25] truth but how could you speak it oh
[1:37:27] except God would plant something in your
[1:37:30] life amen when Ahab went up to fight at
[1:37:33] Routh Gilead and Jehoshaphat said we
[1:37:36] should consult the Lord about this and
[1:37:38] they consulted 400 preachers and they
[1:37:40] got an answer but it wasn't good enough
[1:37:42] for Jehoshaphat said do you have one
[1:37:44] more said yes I got a Micaiah I've got a
[1:37:47] Micaiah but I hate him he's always
[1:37:49] prophesying evil against me but he said
[1:37:52] go get him and let's see what he says
[1:37:54] and he said oh you can just say what the
[1:37:56] rest of them were saying but he said no
[1:37:58] I'll say what the I'll say what the word
[1:38:00] of the Lord says I'll only say what the
[1:38:03] L what the word says and brother Brandon
[1:38:05] said you can be a Micaiah said I'll only
[1:38:07] say what this word says and so he begins
[1:38:10] to prophesy what looks like evil over
[1:38:13] Ahab but prophecy had to be fulfilled
[1:38:16] brother and God said brother BR said
[1:38:18] that God was up there counseling that
[1:38:20] what we do that Ahab would be deceived
[1:38:23] and prophecy might be fulfilled and the
[1:38:25] lying Spirit came up from hell and said
[1:38:28] I'll go down and get into those 400
[1:38:30] preachers that he'll be deceived oh but
[1:38:33] why couldn't that lying Spirit get into
[1:38:35] Micaiah because he was of a different
[1:38:37] breed he was of the spirit of Truth and
[1:38:41] brother God got to you before that lying
[1:38:43] Spirit ever could and impregnated you
[1:38:46] with the SE word of God and God got to
[1:38:49] you before the devil could
[1:38:51] and that's why you cannot commit
[1:38:53] adultery with this word you're already
[1:38:55] pregnated your womb is already sealed
[1:38:58] and all you can say brother this word is
[1:39:00] for me I don't care what the devil says
[1:39:03] this word is for me this word is for my
[1:39:06] family oh you want to know what this
[1:39:09] message means to me brother if Jesus
[1:39:11] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[1:39:14] forever and he is then this word means
[1:39:17] to me that I can too it means if it
[1:39:20] works for brother brandom it'll work for
[1:39:22] me if it worked for brother Steven it'll
[1:39:25] work for me if it worked for Paul it'll
[1:39:27] work for me if Jesus could do it then I
[1:39:31] can too because he's the same yesterday
[1:39:33] today and forever and I'm a Believer and
[1:39:36] that channel is open for the word to
[1:39:39] come in so brother if he raised from the
[1:39:41] dead we can too if he healed the sick we
[1:39:45] can too if he's spoken tongues we can
[1:39:48] too if blind Bemus can trust to him so
[1:39:51] can you if the woman with the blood is
[1:39:53] you can trust in so can you GL oh it's a
[1:39:56] Revival of Jesus Christ the same
[1:39:59] yesterday today and forever amen amen as
[1:40:02] we bring it to a close brother brandham
[1:40:04] talked about that bumblebee he said
[1:40:06] science learned that the Bumblebee was
[1:40:08] too heavy to fly oh he just couldn't fly
[1:40:12] but he said so the Bumblebee didn't know
[1:40:13] what science was saying about him so he
[1:40:16] just flew anyhow and brother Brandon
[1:40:18] said they say that Miracles can't happen
[1:40:21] but we just had to do like the Bumblebee
[1:40:23] didn't we Brother Hicks Fly Away anyhow
[1:40:25] and do the work of the Lord oh brother
[1:40:29] Congressman Upshaw shouldn't have ever
[1:40:31] walked again after being crippled for 66
[1:40:33] years but he did it anyhow yes sir
[1:40:36] Georgie Carter should have never got out
[1:40:38] of bed after being there for 9 years and
[1:40:41] weighing 35 lbs but she did it anyhow oh
[1:40:45] there's a young girl by the name of
[1:40:46] Mariah pu at alipa oh she shouldn't have
[1:40:51] natural beautiful hair today but she
[1:40:53] does anyhow brother oh brother Ron
[1:40:56] Spencer with four stage cancer shouldn't
[1:40:58] still be alive according to Medical
[1:41:00] Science but he's alive anyhow why
[1:41:04] because you've stopped listening to the
[1:41:05] voice of science you stop listening to
[1:41:08] the voice of the devil oh and why don't
[1:41:10] you do like the Bumblebee tonight and
[1:41:13] just fly away despite what the devil
[1:41:15] says despite what that lie says over
[1:41:18] your mind Fly Away oh you shouldn't be
[1:41:22] here but you are anyhow brother you
[1:41:24] never should have got the Holy Ghost but
[1:41:26] you did anyhow you broke through family
[1:41:29] Cycles you broke through family bondage
[1:41:32] you broke through all kinds of
[1:41:34] opposition opposition means nothing when
[1:41:37] God speaks and brother the word has
[1:41:39] spoken over our lives and we're here
[1:41:42] anyhow we're going to make it anyhow
[1:41:45] we're going to make a Rapture anyhow oh
[1:41:48] because God said I'll have a bride
[1:41:50] without without spot or wrinkle and I
[1:41:52] say be it unto me according to your word
[1:41:55] oh Lord oh do you feel the power of
[1:41:57] influence it'll work this message Works
[1:42:01] it'll work for your family oh cast down
[1:42:05] imagination oh but if God's given you a
[1:42:08] good mind then don't waste it just let
[1:42:11] him wash it and use that mind to say oh
[1:42:14] Lord hallelujah it's reasonable that if
[1:42:17] you're the same yesterday today and
[1:42:18] forever then you're still a heal
[1:42:21] oh God's given you a good memory why
[1:42:23] don't you use it to remember the
[1:42:25] promises of God God's given you a good
[1:42:27] mind to think why don't you start
[1:42:29] thinking about the Lord and His
[1:42:31] blessings Lord if you're a Healer
[1:42:33] yesterday then it's reasonable that
[1:42:35] you're still a Healer today my brother
[1:42:37] it's reasonable that you're still
[1:42:39] filling with the Holy Ghost brother it's
[1:42:41] reasonable that if that infallible word
[1:42:44] can never fall on good ground it'll
[1:42:46] manifest exactly what he said yes my
[1:42:49] brother oh
[1:42:51] if you want to reason devil then let's
[1:42:53] reason Jesus Christ is the same
[1:42:55] yesterday today and forever oh and so
[1:42:58] it's reasonable that if a people could
[1:43:01] just believe all things are possible
[1:43:04] it's reasonable that if Jesus Christ is
[1:43:06] in this building right now there's no
[1:43:08] limit to what take place it's reasonable
[1:43:11] that if he's here then if it may be 4
[1:43:15] days late in your mind it may be just on
[1:43:18] time in his mind because that's what he
[1:43:21] did for Martha and that's what he can do
[1:43:24] for you oh just let that reason come
[1:43:27] through the word don't let it come
[1:43:28] through the devil let it come through
[1:43:30] this word and say Lord I believe it
[1:43:33] you're the amen amen You're The Great I
[1:43:36] Am amen amen it's nothing but the truth
[1:43:40] amen glory to God oh let it grow yes sir
[1:43:43] brother Brenham said all things that's
[1:43:45] not all things that's against that word
[1:43:47] are contrary to it will have to move yes
[1:43:49] my brother it to give place yes sir
[1:43:52] because the word is coming triumphantly
[1:43:54] there's nothing can stop it amen God has
[1:43:57] done said so amen amen amen now the
[1:44:00] devil yes sir
[1:44:03] presumed that he could follow that
[1:44:05] Israelite Army through the Red Sea
[1:44:07] that's the problem but see the devil was
[1:44:11] not of the same caliber that's exactly
[1:44:13] right it was a bunch of uncircumcised
[1:44:15] Philistines that presumed we can too but
[1:44:18] it didn't work for them because that
[1:44:20] wasn't their law in the scripture amen
[1:44:23] but if you can know where you stand in
[1:44:25] that word then you can stand fast oh and
[1:44:28] that devil can't go where you're going
[1:44:31] he can't follow you into that Holy Ghost
[1:44:33] he can't follow you into that third pole
[1:44:36] he can't follow you into this Rapture am
[1:44:38] that's not his part of scripture but
[1:44:41] this Jubilee has called your name and
[1:44:43] because you were a Son of God born into
[1:44:46] this kingdom of God God Gave You ears to
[1:44:49] hear that trumpet say come out of her
[1:44:53] come back to your Homeland come back to
[1:44:56] your inheritance oh it was a certain
[1:44:58] sound brother Steven it was a it was a
[1:45:01] solid sound that's exactly right because
[1:45:04] my brother brother Brandon would say
[1:45:07] about about how America's Revival was
[1:45:10] over right and he said that after he
[1:45:14] preached that a young man got up and
[1:45:17] said well he was a Pentecostal I have
[1:45:20] the quote but just paraphrasing it said
[1:45:22] it may be over for brother Brandon but
[1:45:24] it's not over for me and you know got
[1:45:26] all excited and that that's nice it
[1:45:29] sounds nice it sounds like Jubilee but
[1:45:32] it was an uncertain sound that's exactly
[1:45:35] because it wasn't from the word amen
[1:45:37] amen amen amen and brother we've heard a
[1:45:39] jubilee trumpet and it's a certain sound
[1:45:43] calling us out of confusion calling you
[1:45:46] to a liberty calling you to your
[1:45:48] position as a son and
[1:45:51] yes my brother and and now it's not
[1:45:53] priest blowing the trumpets but it's
[1:45:56] it's ministers blowing the gospel
[1:45:58] trumpet and how can we Blow The Gospel
[1:46:01] trumpet and know it's going to be a
[1:46:02] certain sound just stay with the message
[1:46:06] stay with only the word of God and
[1:46:10] brother you sound that word it'll be a
[1:46:12] certain sound that's it oh and sometimes
[1:46:14] it'll bring correction right sometimes
[1:46:17] it'll bring encouragement that's right
[1:46:19] but brother br said you'll either be a
[1:46:21] truth rejecting prisoner or know the
[1:46:24] truth and go free and when I say Lord I
[1:46:27] want to receive this truth amen and I
[1:46:29] Want to Be Free amen and me if this word
[1:46:32] blesses me I want to receive its
[1:46:34] blessing if it corrects me I want to
[1:46:36] receive its correction but I just want
[1:46:38] to blow that trumpet oh just as The
[1:46:42] Messengers have blown it Through the
[1:46:44] Ages all right in this word amen oh and
[1:46:48] we want to rejoice yes sir if I need
[1:46:52] corrected then Lord correct me that's it
[1:46:54] but if I'm if I'm blessed then bless you
[1:46:59] see sometimes as the musicians can come
[1:47:02] sometimes it's so much easier for you to
[1:47:04] give place to the negative anden and
[1:47:06] you'll take correction all day long and
[1:47:09] feel like you deserve it but when the
[1:47:11] word once says you're blessed it's so
[1:47:13] hard for you to receive that but guys
[1:47:15] you think maybe it's not for me but I
[1:47:17] made so many mistakes but brother you
[1:47:20] got stop giving place to the devil and
[1:47:22] start giving place to the word and if
[1:47:25] the word corrects you give place to it
[1:47:27] but if the word blesses you place to it
[1:47:30] give place to the blessings give place
[1:47:32] to the healing give place to the Holy
[1:47:34] Ghost give place to the blood to forgive
[1:47:37] you of your sins and let it go put it
[1:47:40] behind you oh let the word wash your
[1:47:44] minds and renew you in your mind amen
[1:47:49] amen amen amen amen it's nothing but the
[1:47:52] truth glory to God oh it's nothing but
[1:47:54] the truth yes my brother yes oh we want
[1:47:57] to wonderful we want the truth Lord yes
