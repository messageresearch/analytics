[39:50] [Applause]
[39:55] the power today and the air conditioning
[40:00] working
[40:01] Amanda it took the grace of God on
[40:04] Sunday the anointing was so strong until
[40:06] we forgot about the temperature
[40:09] amen glory to God we want to praise God
[40:12] for restoring everything back in order
[40:16] amen he remind me one time at brother
[40:19] Chad Lamb that the power went off and
[40:22] they had service under a tree
[40:25] so could have been worse but God kept us
[40:28] here and cold the temperature send an
[40:30] anointing and then before you know it we
[40:32] forgot about everything and what a
[40:35] wonderful sermon amen the supernatural
[40:38] making itself known amen and I'm proud
[40:42] We got the supernatural in the midst of
[40:44] us we got the mechanic and the dynamic
[40:48] we got both of them going on
[40:51] because the gospel is not in word only
[40:54] but in the power and the demonstration
[40:57] of the Gospel amen amen there is no way
[41:01] you can put the messaging needs pure
[41:03] Place back in order without the power of
[41:05] the Holy Spirit backing up amen not
[41:08] backing up ass but backing up the word
[41:11] the message because the spirit always
[41:14] follow the message and the spirit and
[41:16] his word are won
[41:18] amen we thank God for it amen you want
[41:22] the dynamic and the mechanic Glory Glory
[41:26] Hallelujah Amen brother Branham
[41:28] mentioned something about the
[41:31] the Evangelical and the Pentecostal he
[41:34] said one knows how to write a check but
[41:37] no money another one got the money and
[41:40] doesn't know how to write the check so
[41:42] you need to have both you need to have
[41:43] both money and you need to know how to
[41:45] write a check and I thank God we got
[41:48] both of them
[41:49] amen we got the power the power of the
[41:53] Lord Jesus Christ and we know how to
[41:55] write our check because every promise in
[41:59] the book is
[42:02] amen every promise in the book is mine
[42:05] every chapter every verse every line so
[42:09] it's up to you to search what is in the
[42:11] scripture that belong to you claim it
[42:14] and Associate your faith there and then
[42:16] you can get it amen
[42:18] you pray for me so we can pick up on
[42:21] Sunday where we left and continue to go
[42:23] amen
[42:25] how many were here when I spoke about
[42:27] the evidence of the holy spirit in
[42:29] question and answer
[42:30] you remember that it's a question that
[42:32] has been all over the message for a year
[42:34] what is the evidence of the Holy Spirit
[42:36] and thing and I mentioned that how many
[42:39] were here
[42:40] it was in question and answer okay okay
[42:43] yeah because I use a coat on Sunday
[42:45] where brother Branham uses love as the
[42:48] greatest evidence
[42:49] and then after 63 brother Branham said
[42:52] the Holy Spirit straighten him up and
[42:54] say it's the word
[42:55] but the Capstone also is love
[43:00] so now you need to know how to put coach
[43:02] together
[43:05] everybody okay you need to know how to
[43:08] put coach together and I'm a firm
[43:11] believer those that are online I'm a
[43:14] firm believer that the message doesn't
[43:16] contradict itself
[43:20] amen amen you remember last question and
[43:24] answer we had to quote
[43:27] we had several quotes where brother
[43:29] Branham say Moses and Elijah are going
[43:31] to be the same Moses and Elijah and
[43:33] there was only one coat after the seals
[43:36] when brother went to question and answer
[43:37] brother say I'm inclined to believe that
[43:41] it's going to be the anointing on people
[43:43] amen those quotes never contradict one
[43:46] another
[43:47] if you were there on question and answer
[43:49] you know what I'm talking about we took
[43:51] buff coat and put them together and
[43:53] found out that brother Branham never
[43:55] deviated from what we spoke
[43:57] is it the anointing yes is it the same
[44:00] people yes both quotes are corrected
[44:03] [Applause]
[44:05] so when you read brother Branham you
[44:07] need to be very careful
[44:10] I can take before the seals and go in
[44:13] marriage and divorce and pick up things
[44:15] that brother Branham spoke before the
[44:17] seals and pulled them after the seal and
[44:20] put them together and brother Brian I'm
[44:21] never contradict himself it's just the
[44:24] opening of the seals built a greater
[44:27] open a greater Revelation brother
[44:29] Brandon preached serpent seed but after
[44:32] the seals open he pick up marriage and
[44:34] divorce and the way he dropped with
[44:36] serpent seed is only deeper than the
[44:39] serpent seed before so you take the
[44:41] serpent seed before and after the seal
[44:43] and you see the whole picture clarify so
[44:46] you pray for me I will see if I need to
[44:49] catch up on that evidence before I move
[44:52] forward or if everything that was if
[44:55] everybody that was in question and
[44:57] answer are okay we keep moving forward
[44:59] but you pray for me and I see how it is
[45:01] because somebody uh reminded me sending
[45:05] me a quote where the holy spirit is
[45:07] straightening them up and I have like uh
[45:10] if I'm not mistaken I don't know it's
[45:12] seven or eight coat that I have loaded
[45:14] so if I begin to read them on Sunday I
[45:17] won't preach what I'm trying to preach
[45:20] so I will see whether I can pull fewer
[45:22] and then the remaining I put them on the
[45:25] church group chat and you continue with
[45:27] it but just to bring the balance and to
[45:31] see where things are when we say
[45:33] receiving the word of the hour you need
[45:35] to know where are you receiving the word
[45:37] of the hour
[45:39] because we got people that preached this
[45:42] message for a long time that we thought
[45:44] received the word of the hour
[45:46] and after 20 years those people left the
[45:49] message at the beginning we thought they
[45:51] received the word of the hour man now
[45:54] when they leave the message did they
[45:55] really receive the word of the hour so
[45:57] you need to know what is receiving the
[45:59] word of the arm the one who received the
[46:01] word by revelation will stay on that
[46:04] word all the way to the end
[46:05] [Music]
[46:06] [Applause]
[46:07] amen
[46:10] you pray for me and I see the direction
[46:12] of the holy spirit amen
[46:14] did I stir your mind
[46:16] now you are your appetite is already
[46:21] stirred up if you want you go back to
[46:23] the sermon you revisit that again
[46:25] because on Sunday I'm trying to get
[46:26] where faith and love are working deeper
[46:29] and the Holy Spirit even unfolded
[46:31] something that I will probably deal with
[46:33] married people if I get a chance to have
[46:35] a married couple I've never seen it I
[46:37] read it before never I read it read it
[46:40] use the code and recently I look at and
[46:42] say oh my goodness this message is
[46:44] something it's like the scripture when
[46:46] you're reading brother Branham they got
[46:47] layers under what brother Branham is
[46:49] saying you can read the message and you
[46:51] don't really get what brother Branham is
[46:53] saying until the Holy Spirit open up and
[46:55] say oh my God this is something really

[50:59] their portion of the children's bread
[51:03] we are this in the name of the Lord
[51:05] Jesus Christ amen
[51:09] Hallelujah
[51:13] before we take our seats I want us to
[51:15] read a scripture
[51:18] from Philippians chapter 2
[51:24] and verse 12 Philippians chapter 2 verse
[51:28] 12.
[51:40] and we'll read our second scripture also
[51:43] from
[51:44] John chapter 4 and verse 24.
[51:48] so we look at Philippians chapter 2 and
[51:51] verse 24.
[51:56] let's hear the word of the Lord wait for
[51:58] my beloved
[52:00] as ye have always obeyed not us in my
[52:04] presence only
[52:06] but now much more in my absence
[52:10] work out your own salvation with fear
[52:14] and trembling amen
[52:16] and then John chapter 4
[52:26] the god
[52:28] is a spirit
[52:31] and they that worship Him
[52:34] must worship Him in spirit and in truth
[52:38] amen
[52:40] can we please take our seats
[52:46] I'm very grateful
[52:51] to be here with you
[52:53] not seeing myself as a visitor but as
[52:56] one of you
[52:57] because uh
[53:00] we are all
[53:02] on the same wavelengths
[53:04] and there
[53:07] I bring greetings from
[53:09] Ghana
[53:10] and Cape Coast which is the central
[53:12] region that is where I am with a little
[53:15] flock of
[53:16] about
[53:18] 150
[53:20] and
[53:22] I bring greetings also from my family
[53:26] um
[53:27] I want to thank
[53:28] brother Stephen so much for
[53:32] gave me the hand at the right hand of
[53:34] Fellowship
[53:35] you know it's I'm meeting him for the
[53:38] first time and I believe he's also
[53:39] meeting me for the first time and as a
[53:43] minister it's not easy yes leaving your
[53:46] Pulpit to somebody
[53:48] you don't know or you haven't heard
[53:50] before
[53:51] so me I mean it's a risky thing
[53:54] so oh yes
[53:57] because anything that is done wrong you
[54:00] have to go back is it when something is
[54:03] being damaged it takes just a short time
[54:06] but to get this incorrect corrected
[54:08] takes a longer time so it's not easy I
[54:13] really appreciate you my brother I
[54:15] appreciate you so much yes
[54:17] it's no easy
[54:19] um
[54:22] this evening I just want to talk about
[54:24] the lonely program
[54:27] the lonely pilgrim
[54:32] he said God is a spirit and they that
[54:35] worship Him must worship Him in spirit
[54:37] and in truth
[54:40] again he says in Philippians chapter 12
[54:43] we've already read wherefore my beloved
[54:46] I see have always obeyed not us in my
[54:50] presence only but now much more
[54:54] in my absence work out your own
[54:57] salvation with fear and trembling so the
[55:01] salvation
[55:03] is based on we as individuals
[55:09] lonely program
[55:11] so it's not by sight or it's by what
[55:15] others say
[55:16] but it is by what you believe
[55:21] you know Christianity is a call of God
[55:25] has to call you
[55:28] and God calling you as an individual
[55:33] he doesn't call us as a group
[55:35] as individuals like our Father Abraham
[55:39] was called
[55:40] you know when God called him Abraham
[55:43] thought oh well Lord is my nephew oh my
[55:46] whatever and it doesn't really matter
[55:50] going along with him
[55:52] but we know the story what happened
[55:55] how about his blessings were withheld
[55:58] until
[55:59] there came a separation between him and
[56:03] Lord right
[56:04] so God didn't include Lord in that call
[56:08] the call was for Abraham and him alone
[56:11] see he was to go alone and follow the
[56:15] lord
[56:16] God didn't want any interference
[56:20] in that relationship
[56:25] but he took a lot along anyhow
[56:30] and so it's kind of
[56:34] affected that that relation that God
[56:37] wanted to have with him
[56:39] I was asking Pastor whether I could be
[56:43] quoting the prophet he said you are in
[56:46] line with me
[56:48] because otherwise whatever I say
[56:52] if it's not from the Bible and from in
[56:55] front of it's not from the message then
[56:57] it is not authentic
[57:02] Hallelujah
[57:04] so I I have the Liberty to quote the
[57:07] prophet
[57:10] amen
[57:12] in a message Jehovah Jireh
[57:16] he said and we find him then that God
[57:19] told him to separate himself
[57:22] from all his Kindred that is Abraham and
[57:25] to walk among estranged people
[57:29] speaking a strange language so he was
[57:33] Abraham who was to leave his father's
[57:36] house leave his kindness leave
[57:38] everything and to go and walk among
[57:42] estranged people
[57:43] and I believe we are strange people
[57:46] the Bible says we are peculiar people
[57:53] kind of synonymous you can interchange
[57:57] them and say that maybe there's a
[57:58] difference so
[58:00] you are we have been called to be among
[58:03] extreme people speaking strange language
[58:07] you know and our language is strange
[58:10] it's strange to all the people
[58:13] because here we are we talk about
[58:14] adoption
[58:16] we talk about uh original saying we talk
[58:20] about uh serpent seed we talk about
[58:23] predestination
[58:27] and all that it's a strange language
[58:30] that we speak here
[58:31] and so God has called that to come among
[58:35] the people who speak this strange
[58:36] language
[58:38] so that we can also speak that string
[58:40] language
[58:42] everyone was called to be among those
[58:45] people
[58:46] say when you become a Christian
[58:50] you've got to separate yourself from
[58:52] your sinful Associates
[58:58] friends and can be relatives whatever
[59:03] who will not help you
[59:05] as long as you work with these people
[59:07] you cannot progress in your Christian
[59:09] Journey
[59:11] so you are to separate us so we
[59:13] including myself we are to separate
[59:15] ourselves from sinful Associates
[59:19] that's exactly right come out from among
[59:21] them my people be separate say the Lord
[59:25] it's a different walk
[59:31] it's an individual work
[59:34] it's a walk between you and God Alone
[59:39] and just you and he
[59:42] yes two can travel the road that you and
[59:47] he
[59:47] [Applause]
[59:50] so it's a different walk
[59:53] the call in our lives
[59:57] is a different walk it's you and God
[1:00:00] Alone
[1:00:01] no intermediary
[1:00:04] Hallelujah
[1:00:06] you know
[1:00:08] probably talks about Elisha when Elijah
[1:00:11] had his call
[1:00:15] the bible say that he banned
[1:00:18] the very tool that he was using to work
[1:00:21] right the ox and the the plow right he
[1:00:25] just banned the plow kill the ox and
[1:00:28] then just made a party or whatever
[1:00:32] for his friends
[1:00:35] so there was nothing for Elisha to look
[1:00:38] back
[1:00:39] to again
[1:00:41] everyone says that when we come to
[1:00:43] Christ we must break all the bridges
[1:00:46] behind us
[1:00:49] see bring all the bridges all the
[1:00:51] associates anything that will cause you
[1:00:53] to want to go back get rid of them
[1:00:58] that is what Elisha did because that
[1:01:02] call was so important in his life and I
[1:01:04] believe that the call of God in our
[1:01:06] lives must be so important more
[1:01:08] important than anything that we can
[1:01:10] think of in this life
[1:01:12] see because we will answer
[1:01:15] for our attitude toward the call of God
[1:01:18] in our lives
[1:01:20] each one of us will answer for himself
[1:01:23] you see something we can't hide behind
[1:01:25] anything
[1:01:27] we can't hide behind even this message
[1:01:29] no we will be given up we will be
[1:01:32] exposed
[1:01:34] see we'll be exposed
[1:01:36] so we have to be as true and sincere
[1:01:40] as possible
[1:01:46] no one's sin will be imposed on another
[1:01:51] your sins will not be imputed unto
[1:01:54] another because I say the soul destiny
[1:01:57] shall die
[1:02:00] Hallelujah
[1:02:03] we should let this thing register in our
[1:02:05] hearts that you are alone
[1:02:10] you are alone you are a lonely Traveler
[1:02:13] a lonely program
[1:02:16] we come together like we have done
[1:02:20] we will sing and shout and praise the
[1:02:23] Lord and worship together but remember
[1:02:25] that you are an individual
[1:02:28] God is dealing with you as an individual
[1:02:31] Hallelujah
[1:02:34] we we rejoice when we come to we are
[1:02:36] happy but then remember we are an
[1:02:39] individual
[1:02:43] we praise the Lord together we worship
[1:02:45] we are happy together
[1:02:48] individual
[1:02:50] regardless of the size of the church you
[1:02:53] can be a thousand it can be anything
[1:02:55] still you are an individual
[1:02:59] you stand alone you are one unit
[1:03:02] so you stand alone
[1:03:04] Hallelujah
[1:03:09] the prophet said questions and as I said
[1:03:11] it will be like me saying oh you judge
[1:03:14] now every one of you
[1:03:17] come in and be baptized here with water
[1:03:19] and we put you on the church membership
[1:03:24] we are all going to go together say why
[1:03:27] brother that's not the scripture
[1:03:30] that's not it
[1:03:32] oh we're all going together no that is
[1:03:34] not it
[1:03:36] that's not the scripture unless you are
[1:03:39] born again
[1:03:41] circumcise of the Holy Spirit
[1:03:44] I don't care how good you are
[1:03:47] what church you belong to how good your
[1:03:50] parents are
[1:03:51] right except you as an individual has
[1:03:54] been born again by the Holy Ghost you
[1:03:58] will never go in the rapture
[1:04:01] I am I am not quoting I'm not saying it
[1:04:03] is not my word
[1:04:05] it's a prophet that you believe
[1:04:12] that's the very delivering sign
[1:04:16] the circumcision yes
[1:04:18] yes and the circumcision is by the Holy
[1:04:21] Spirit
[1:04:25] something on Prison
[1:04:30] he said we should never presume
[1:04:33] it's a presumption or presuming is like
[1:04:36] venturing without Authority
[1:04:43] so as we
[1:04:46] follow the message we follow the word of
[1:04:48] God we serve the Lord let us not presume
[1:04:51] that all is well oh we are all going it
[1:04:55] is not it is not scripture
[1:04:59] presumption
[1:05:01] you suppose that something is the case
[1:05:04] on the basis of probability no it
[1:05:07] doesn't work that way
[1:05:09] to venture without Authority taking
[1:05:11] something for granted now that's
[1:05:14] something that the church must not do it
[1:05:17] we do not have to take things for
[1:05:18] granted
[1:05:21] I'm assuming I'm I hope I am one of them
[1:05:24] no it's not a hope it's not a matter of
[1:05:26] Hope be sure be certain
[1:05:29] Hallelujah
[1:05:31] that if it's even one person that is to
[1:05:36] make the Rapture in this congregation
[1:05:38] say Lord it must be me
[1:05:42] it's not about presuming it will not
[1:05:44] help us
[1:05:46] say we should not presume
[1:05:49] so in the family
[1:05:51] the father's sense won't be against the
[1:05:54] sons
[1:05:56] parents righteousness
[1:05:59] cannot cover the children
[1:06:02] the prophet says that God has no
[1:06:04] grandchildren
[1:06:07] so each each one must stand on his own
[1:06:10] ground
[1:06:12] hasn't got grandchildren
[1:06:14] so if I am a pastor
[1:06:19] whatever I do does not cover my children
[1:06:24] Hallelujah if I am that no I stand alone
[1:06:28] my wife stands alone my children stand
[1:06:31] alone each one
[1:06:34] will give account of himself
[1:06:38] because the Bible said in Matthew
[1:06:40] chapter 24 say that day two Souls be in
[1:06:44] bed
[1:06:45] won't be taking
[1:06:47] yeah one will be left
[1:06:49] two women are filled
[1:06:51] won't be taking
[1:06:52] the other will be left two women will be
[1:06:55] grinding
[1:06:56] while we taking
[1:06:58] one will be left you see so it shows
[1:07:01] that no matter the relationship
[1:07:05] you cannot your ticket will not be based
[1:07:09] on another man's a woman's ticket
[1:07:14] so we are all going to stand alone
[1:07:21] if you're a student in your school stand
[1:07:23] alone yes you're a worker wherever you
[1:07:26] are working stand alone let Christ be
[1:07:29] seen in you
[1:07:30] don't just join the masses
[1:07:33] because God has a call in your life you
[1:07:36] have God's call in your life
[1:07:39] Hallelujah whatever on the streets in a
[1:07:42] family wherever
[1:07:45] therefore we will all be tempted
[1:07:48] individually
[1:07:52] I have my Temptations you have yours
[1:07:55] to have your trials I have my
[1:07:58] I have my challenges you have yours
[1:08:02] so each one of us will go through our
[1:08:05] own trials challenges difficulties and
[1:08:08] all that yes
[1:08:10] yes they may be different
[1:08:13] but then
[1:08:14] as the Bible says all through the blood
[1:08:17] some through the fly some through the
[1:08:19] water some through the fire but all
[1:08:22] through the blood
[1:08:24] by then it's on individual basis
[1:08:27] Hallelujah
[1:08:29] we are it's only individual business
[1:08:31] problem we're talking about when Israel
[1:08:33] got to cut this burn here
[1:08:35] now is the time to test them it was an
[1:08:38] individual issue
[1:08:40] and so we also have a Kardashians
[1:08:43] well we are attempted where we are tried
[1:08:46] when we are tested
[1:08:49] individually
[1:08:53] we go to church
[1:08:56] each one of us
[1:08:58] we come with different maybe
[1:09:02] intentions or
[1:09:04] whatever
[1:09:07] but the basic thing is
[1:09:11] right it might be because we love God
[1:09:15] we don't come here
[1:09:16] to seek let me say to seek husbands and
[1:09:20] wives
[1:09:21] we don't come here because
[1:09:24] my job is I've lost my job
[1:09:27] well don't come here because
[1:09:29] for some time now I've been sick and all
[1:09:32] that those things are secondary we come
[1:09:35] here because we love God and we want to
[1:09:37] worship we want to save we want to live
[1:09:39] for him
[1:09:40] that is why we come together the other
[1:09:43] things he will take care of
[1:09:46] but that's not the primary thing that's
[1:09:47] not the reason why we meet here
[1:09:50] we meet us to serve him to worship him
[1:09:52] to love him
[1:09:53] to appreciate him
[1:09:59] like we always say let him have
[1:10:02] preeminence
[1:10:06] he must have preeminence
[1:10:09] the promise said until you become a
[1:10:13] prisoner to God God cannot use you
[1:10:17] that is having preeminence if you become
[1:10:19] a prisoner to him I mean he has
[1:10:21] preeminence in our life then the other
[1:10:23] things will follow
[1:10:26] yes our burdens are different
[1:10:29] everything that we go through we go
[1:10:30] through differently we might have
[1:10:32] similar issues but then you stand alone
[1:10:36] God will deal with you alone he will
[1:10:38] deal with me he'll deal with everyone
[1:10:40] alone so abiding different see
[1:10:43] you can think of a Jew one job has had
[1:10:46] this problem
[1:10:50] and um Mrs job was also kind of affected
[1:10:56] because now
[1:10:59] the home was not as comfortable as it
[1:11:02] used to be
[1:11:04] those days when everything was at her
[1:11:07] disposal
[1:11:09] she could Pride herself as Mrs Joe
[1:11:13] one thing became so difficult
[1:11:19] she was even ashamed
[1:11:21] to be Associated or identify with job
[1:11:25] so the point of time he said yo what are
[1:11:28] you doing just cancel that golden ninja
[1:11:30] says let's be free so you speak like a
[1:11:33] foolish woman
[1:11:35] see when things happen God will be
[1:11:40] waiting he'll be looking at our
[1:11:43] individual reactions
[1:11:45] [Music]
[1:11:46] to all the things that we go through
[1:11:50] he is able to Deliver Us from them all
[1:11:53] but then he looks at how you react
[1:11:56] towards that issue that problem
[1:12:00] [Music]
[1:12:03] and job's truth
[1:12:05] by the wife
[1:12:08] we know what happened same thing with
[1:12:10] Lord's wife
[1:12:12] you know as long as God was providing
[1:12:16] for them
[1:12:17] oh it was a nice thing
[1:12:21] when everything was Rosy at home
[1:12:26] they will go to church
[1:12:28] they will never be late
[1:12:33] one now things became to it began to be
[1:12:36] rough
[1:12:38] they began to have excuses
[1:12:41] why they were late why they couldn't
[1:12:43] come yesterday why this and that and
[1:12:46] that and that
[1:12:52] says a life that is full of excuses is
[1:12:57] not worthy of the Gospel
[1:12:59] [Music]
[1:13:01] you know God is watching us every act
[1:13:04] that we take away every move that we
[1:13:07] make God is watching us
[1:13:10] you know one trials and
[1:13:13] difficulties challenges come our way
[1:13:15] that's not the end of the world
[1:13:18] and again a prophet has told that you
[1:13:20] see when Temptations come
[1:13:22] if it is coming from the devil his aim
[1:13:26] is to flow us to put us down but when
[1:13:29] God tries us or put temptation of trial
[1:13:32] on us it is to strengthen us because he
[1:13:35] knows he knows that we cannot fall
[1:13:38] [Applause]
[1:13:41] but he brings us in just to test us and
[1:13:45] then to lift us up onto another level
[1:13:52] but you see you are a lonely pilgrim
[1:13:56] you are a lonely traveler trying to make
[1:13:59] it to heaven
[1:14:02] so let your life
[1:14:05] let our lives be clean myself let our
[1:14:08] lives portray him at all times in all
[1:14:12] situations in all try difficulties and
[1:14:16] everything let us project let us reflect
[1:14:19] him
[1:14:28] we shouldn't be like
[1:14:31] Joe's wife
[1:14:33] or Lord's wife
[1:14:35] will only be faithful to God when
[1:14:38] there's plenty
[1:14:43] one difficult times come
[1:14:46] then
[1:14:48] we we take vacation
[1:14:56] take a vacation
[1:14:59] in serving the lord but we don't take
[1:15:01] vacation in serving the lord
[1:15:10] we don't have to take vacation
[1:15:11] Hallelujah
[1:15:17] we don't even even testify only when God
[1:15:21] has done good things supposedly good
[1:15:24] things in our lives
[1:15:25] even when things are rough I believe we
[1:15:27] need to testify
[1:15:29] [Applause]
[1:15:32] I'm going through this but praise the
[1:15:34] Lord thank God I know he's he's on my
[1:15:36] side
[1:15:38] you see
[1:15:38] [Applause]
[1:15:40] and then God knows that my son or my
[1:15:43] daughter has so much trust in me despite
[1:15:46] all that is happening to him he's still
[1:15:48] praising me he's so thanking me
[1:15:51] see
[1:15:53] God has paid those things from us
[1:16:01] we shouldn't save him only when
[1:16:04] things are smooth
[1:16:06] when things are comfortable when we are
[1:16:09] not comfortable zone or Comfort zones no
[1:16:11] but in all situations
[1:16:17] even if he slay me
[1:16:19] so trust me
[1:16:23] maybe if it slays me I will still trust
[1:16:25] him I'll just depends also depend on him
[1:16:34] in the early spiritual experiences
[1:16:37] message
[1:16:38] see now the thing for every individual
[1:16:42] to find is his place in God
[1:16:45] what God has called you to do and then
[1:16:49] abide in that place amen abide in that
[1:16:54] place amen
[1:16:57] Amen Let us find out where God wants us
[1:16:59] to be and then let's abide in that place
[1:17:03] I was just thinking shortly that virgin
[1:17:08] we husbands and wives you know it's a
[1:17:12] Ministry
[1:17:14] it's a Ministry
[1:17:16] and God is expecting something from us
[1:17:20] because he types it to Christ in the
[1:17:23] church
[1:17:26] so if Christ had a Ministry and the
[1:17:28] church also has a Ministry then husband
[1:17:30] and wife you also have Ministries
[1:17:34] I always refer to Ephesians chapter 5 I
[1:17:37] mean sometimes I say it says husbands
[1:17:41] love your own wives
[1:17:44] as Christ loved his Chase he gave
[1:17:47] himself to him
[1:17:49] wives
[1:17:51] submit yourself unto your own husbands
[1:17:55] it is not a condition
[1:17:58] that wives
[1:18:00] if your husbands love you
[1:18:03] submit to them
[1:18:06] husbands
[1:18:07] if your wives submit love them
[1:18:12] [Music]
[1:18:14] no condition about that
[1:18:16] being alone
[1:18:17] [Applause]
[1:18:20] husband does not love you continue to
[1:18:23] submit to him
[1:18:25] if your word does not submit you
[1:18:28] continue to love her
[1:18:31] because you see we will give account of
[1:18:35] our stewardship
[1:18:36] [Music]
[1:18:37] [Applause]
[1:18:38] how we treat our wives how we treat our
[1:18:42] husbands it's your ministry it's my
[1:18:44] Ministry
[1:18:49] don't let it depend on so many factors
[1:18:52] no
[1:18:54] it doesn't depend on any Factor
[1:19:03] praise the Lord
[1:19:06] so husbands and wife God is watching us
[1:19:12] how we treat God's daughter how we treat
[1:19:15] God's son
[1:19:19] [Applause]
[1:19:26] over here
[1:19:28] the wives always serve the upper hand
[1:19:31] so you the the man you dare not
[1:19:36] do anything anyway let me let me leave
[1:19:39] it there
[1:19:42] Hallelujah
[1:19:45] like that should not be that should not
[1:19:47] be
[1:19:51] man is the head of the home
[1:19:53] whether you like it or not
[1:19:56] he didn't choose to be God placed him
[1:19:59] there
[1:19:59] [Applause]
[1:20:02] God said you should be submissive
[1:20:05] just do that be submissive respect your
[1:20:09] husband
[1:20:10] and God will bless you
[1:20:12] if you respect your heart and God will
[1:20:13] bless you
[1:20:17] you are a lonely pilgrim
[1:20:20] but you must be up to your task
[1:20:23] that your responsibilities
[1:20:25] because you are accountable to God
[1:20:28] no one will always stand with you on
[1:20:30] that day you will have to give account
[1:20:32] of your stewardship
[1:20:42] change God is watching us
[1:20:45] as individuals
[1:20:46] our attitude towards the message
[1:20:51] how do we react to it
[1:20:55] I believe there will not be hypocrites
[1:20:59] I will believe it as a test
[1:21:03] Hallelujah
[1:21:06] we're individuals and God is watching us
[1:21:10] say God is watching us
[1:21:13] I believe that we should also be
[1:21:14] grateful to our pastor
[1:21:17] Hallelujah because
[1:21:22] I'm not referring you back but you are
[1:21:25] here
[1:21:27] because you have to be here
[1:21:31] because he didn't want to be led astray
[1:21:35] Hallelujah
[1:21:36] that's why you are here
[1:21:39] and so
[1:21:40] be thankful to your pastor and always
[1:21:43] pray for him
[1:21:45] because
[1:21:47] he is a leader
[1:21:50] and why as long as you pray for him you
[1:21:52] appreciate him
[1:21:54] God will use him to bless you
[1:21:58] see
[1:21:59] and once again it's not everything that
[1:22:02] the pastor can do
[1:22:03] the prophet says something here it's not
[1:22:07] everything that a pastor can do the
[1:22:09] deacons can do the trust he can do
[1:22:18] guess a moment
[1:22:22] yes in a certain a sudden secret going
[1:22:25] away of the church
[1:22:27] yeah
[1:22:29] paragraph 381 he said you can't expect
[1:22:32] your pastor to do it all
[1:22:35] you can't expect your trustee ball to do
[1:22:38] it all or your Deacon board you've got
[1:22:40] to make yourself ready it's an
[1:22:43] individual affair
[1:22:49] and remember His coming is so sudden
[1:22:53] that the church will go in a twinkle of
[1:22:55] an eye
[1:22:56] and if we see sin on every hand and
[1:23:01] judgment pending in the battleship of
[1:23:04] ghosts wrath coming
[1:23:06] how can we escape this
[1:23:11] will do
[1:23:13] his best
[1:23:16] amen by
[1:23:19] uh
[1:23:20] no signing to declare unto you the whole
[1:23:24] Council of God
[1:23:28] that's all the person can do
[1:23:31] and pray for you
[1:23:34] but you as the student right
[1:23:39] the greater part
[1:23:41] it pays for you
[1:23:44] the teacher teaches you go home and you
[1:23:47] relax how can you pass your exams
[1:23:53] some don't it is true some don't even
[1:23:55] open their Bibles some don't read the
[1:23:58] message books they are so so dependent
[1:24:01] on the past time they come to church
[1:24:04] what they hear that is enough for
[1:24:06] another week
[1:24:08] that is not it
[1:24:10] you are an individual you are going you
[1:24:13] want to go to heaven but everything
[1:24:15] depends on you
[1:24:19] you are a lonely pilgrim
[1:24:29] the pastor he only gives the guidelines
[1:24:32] and the rice is yours
[1:24:36] see it erases yours
[1:24:39] if you depend on him
[1:24:41] you know
[1:24:42] whether one of these days
[1:24:46] list
[1:24:48] house will be closed
[1:24:53] one of these days
[1:24:55] we cannot meet like this
[1:24:59] one of these days it will be an
[1:25:01] individual basis
[1:25:04] so when we can't meet like this to hear
[1:25:06] the person to hear the song leader to
[1:25:09] hear this and that anyone left alone
[1:25:12] and these Bibles and message books are
[1:25:14] all taken away from us
[1:25:19] as I said the word let the word of God
[1:25:22] dwell in you richly so when you are on
[1:25:26] your own when you are alone
[1:25:28] what is in you will be enough for you
[1:25:32] we'll be able to see you through this
[1:25:35] life
[1:25:39] you are at filled a lonely program
[1:25:45] so let us be mindful
[1:25:49] as I said we can we all Rejoice we are
[1:25:51] happy to see one another but the fact
[1:25:54] Still Remains that you are an individual
[1:25:58] Hallelujah you are an individual
[1:26:01] and God is dealing with you as an
[1:26:03] individual
[1:26:05] and the prophet said God dealt with
[1:26:08] Israel as a nation
[1:26:11] but we Gentiles he is dealing with us as
[1:26:13] individuals
[1:26:20] Hallelujah
[1:26:21] [Music]
[1:26:23] we need to know where we are standing
[1:26:25] and what we are doing
[1:26:30] something then if he sends us from the
[1:26:34] Queen of Sheba if he sends the thing it
[1:26:37] is up
[1:26:39] it's up to the people to receive it or
[1:26:42] to reject it let me say the message
[1:26:44] whatever God has brought it is up to the
[1:26:47] people to receive it or to reject it and
[1:26:49] each one as an individual not because of
[1:26:54] your church standing not because the
[1:26:56] whole church believes it and so you
[1:26:58] follow it no you as an individual you
[1:27:00] make your decision
[1:27:06] it doesn't lay whether your church
[1:27:09] accepts it it's whether you accept it
[1:27:13] salvation is a personal work it's a
[1:27:17] personal faith not a universal church
[1:27:20] Faith but their personal faith in the
[1:27:23] Lord Jesus Christ
[1:27:24] no matter if father don't believe and
[1:27:28] mother don't believe it's what you
[1:27:30] believe
[1:27:35] it's what you believe not what your
[1:27:37] parents believe
[1:27:39] and what you believe
[1:27:42] I believe some of our children were born
[1:27:45] in a message
[1:27:47] but it's high time their winds
[1:27:50] they win themselves
[1:27:52] amen
[1:27:54] so that your faith will not stand
[1:27:57] or will not be based on that of your
[1:28:00] parents but Lord you will have your
[1:28:03] personal revelation
[1:28:07] of your personal revelation
[1:28:09] otherwise my father my mother my father
[1:28:12] my uncle they brought me in they brought
[1:28:14] me you followed them and they realized
[1:28:16] that you you are Hollow
[1:28:18] there's nothing in you
[1:28:22] it's an individual issue
[1:28:25] amen
[1:28:30] Hallelujah
[1:28:34] when the church moved to Babylon like
[1:28:37] the Babylonian captivity
[1:28:41] some said
[1:28:44] how can we sing the Lord's song In a
[1:28:47] Strange Land
[1:28:48] how can we sing the songs of Zion in a
[1:28:52] Strange Land
[1:28:53] how can we practice Christianity in this
[1:28:57] country that is so corrupt
[1:28:59] how can we live different
[1:29:02] from the people
[1:29:08] you know the whole place is corrupt
[1:29:11] a place where I work everybody is doing
[1:29:14] that
[1:29:15] they are stealing they are falsifying
[1:29:17] things they are doing that and doing
[1:29:19] that I know America I see when you come
[1:29:22] here and you don't tell let's all lie
[1:29:26] you're being difficulty
[1:29:28] you can't make ends meet
[1:29:30] and so we end up turning little lies
[1:29:32] here
[1:29:33] false document here this and that my
[1:29:37] breathing these things
[1:29:38] ought not to be sold
[1:29:42] again
[1:29:47] if we lose if we gain these things and
[1:29:50] we lose our salvation
[1:29:55] oh you see that's for this one the Lord
[1:29:57] understands he does not understand
[1:29:58] anything
[1:30:06] [Music]
[1:30:08] you're going to stand alone before God
[1:30:14] yes it's for this you see if I hadn't
[1:30:16] done this ah
[1:30:19] you trouble
[1:30:21] go into that trouble be true be faithful
[1:30:23] go into that room and God will bring you
[1:30:25] out
[1:30:26] [Applause]
[1:30:28] even if he does not bring you out out
[1:30:31] this is not the end of life
[1:30:34] better life awaits you if you stand true
[1:30:41] it's one of the three Hebrew children
[1:30:42] did and that is why they are always
[1:30:44] remembered
[1:30:47] amen
[1:30:50] they didn't meet together they didn't
[1:30:54] meet together to decide not to
[1:30:57] obey the King's Command no
[1:31:00] they took individual decisions
[1:31:08] they took individual decisions
[1:31:14] said
[1:31:19] I am going through Jesus I'm going
[1:31:21] through
[1:31:23] I'll pay the price whatever others do
[1:31:26] I'll take the way with the Lord despise
[1:31:28] you that was measure's song
[1:31:32] and then maybe I bet never was coming my
[1:31:35] Jesus
[1:31:37] bear the cross alone
[1:31:40] and all that will go free
[1:31:43] no there's a cross for me and there's a
[1:31:46] cross for you
[1:31:51] each one came with his own song with his
[1:31:54] own conviction
[1:31:58] [Music]
[1:31:58] [Applause]
[1:32:03] and who is that the third person I've
[1:32:04] forgotten the names Shadrach Shadrach
[1:32:07] said oh
[1:32:09] I know whom I have believed and I am
[1:32:11] persuaded that he's able to keep that
[1:32:14] what he has committed to me which I have
[1:32:16] committed unto him against my day so
[1:32:19] they all come with it came with their
[1:32:21] individual convictions
[1:32:24] a purpose in their heart not to
[1:32:27] be
[1:32:33] there were other Jews there
[1:32:37] when they they were afraid to sing the
[1:32:39] Lost song
[1:32:40] the song of Zion in a Strange Land
[1:32:44] we are in captivity you see God himself
[1:32:47] understands you know let's bow to this
[1:32:49] image God know that if we're not under
[1:32:52] conclusion we wouldn't bow but God knows
[1:32:56] let's bow
[1:33:02] Hallelujah
[1:33:03] this truth
[1:33:07] because they knew that they were
[1:33:09] accountable they were personally I mean
[1:33:12] liable to God
[1:33:18] so they allow God to lead them
[1:33:25] and prophecy in message pattern he said
[1:33:28] I get among Christians sometimes who
[1:33:31] claim to be scented men and women of God
[1:33:34] they are ashamed of a testimony
[1:33:38] they are ashamed to say Amen
[1:33:41] they're ashamed to sing the songs of
[1:33:43] Zion
[1:33:44] they are ashamed everywhere
[1:33:47] I like to get among people who as not
[1:33:51] ashamed of the Gospel of Jesus Christ
[1:33:53] though it seems like heresy but yet they
[1:33:57] are not ashamed
[1:33:59] something has happened and it means more
[1:34:03] than life to them
[1:34:05] it is life life eternal because they
[1:34:09] have accepted God substitute Hallelujah
[1:34:15] we don't have to say when we go to room
[1:34:17] do what the Romans do
[1:34:19] no
[1:34:22] once a Christian always a Christian
[1:34:27] if I'm a Christian in Ghana I come here
[1:34:31] it must continue
[1:34:33] where Christian wherever you came from
[1:34:36] a story that didn't change
[1:34:39] the story there's no change
[1:34:42] we are supposed to be in the wholeness
[1:34:45] of holies
[1:34:47] Hallelujah
[1:34:49] no those in the outer Court we know what
[1:34:52] happens there
[1:34:56] Hallelujah
[1:34:59] the atmosphere is unpredictable
[1:35:04] [Applause]
[1:35:07] today is so Sunny the next moment it
[1:35:10] becomes cloudy and then another time the
[1:35:13] rains begin
[1:35:15] Hallelujah so those in the outer Court
[1:35:18] their lives are unpredictable
[1:35:23] how can you be there and call yourself a
[1:35:26] message you know honestly let me let me
[1:35:29] be honest with you amen let me be honest
[1:35:31] with you amen there are certain
[1:35:34] behaviors and characters and attitudes
[1:35:36] when I see among believers
[1:35:42] among Believers and yes on my head my
[1:35:46] heart bleeds
[1:35:47] how can you claim to to believe this
[1:35:50] message be and and be be in that
[1:35:54] condition
[1:35:55] it worries me honestly
[1:35:58] [Applause]
[1:36:01] if you are going to be on the in the
[1:36:03] outer Court then I'm afraid
[1:36:05] it's getting late
[1:36:09] because I'm going to raise your
[1:36:12] character changes your mood changes when
[1:36:14] it's sunny your mood changes when it is
[1:36:17] this your move changes
[1:36:20] Hallelujah
[1:36:24] I say in the inner Court
[1:36:26] the lights are there
[1:36:28] but they are not perpetual
[1:36:31] the light can go off anytime
[1:36:40] because men lightness this works
[1:36:45] but when you get to the innermost
[1:36:49] his Shekinah Glory it's a kind of
[1:36:52] presence Hallelujah even if you are dead
[1:36:56] there is life there
[1:36:59] Hallelujah
[1:37:00] [Music]
[1:37:03] the manner that was kept there
[1:37:06] never got bad
[1:37:09] aeron's rule that was just a dry stick
[1:37:13] by a day
[1:37:14] because it was in the presence of God
[1:37:18] yo that light never goes off it is a
[1:37:21] Perpetual light and so it will not
[1:37:23] affect your life I mean your life will
[1:37:26] not be up and down drawing some growth
[1:37:28] graph
[1:37:30] Hallelujah
[1:37:32] [Music]
[1:37:34] it should not be that
[1:37:38] that's why you are in the Holiness of

[1:37:42] life will be the same your life will be
[1:37:44] so sweet

[1:37:54] all of us
[1:37:56] and then we must we must never forget
[1:37:59] always remember
[1:38:01] not

[1:38:05] you and you alone
[1:38:09] let your let your life reflect him
[1:38:13] he says I see I believe not only in my
[1:38:17] presence but more so in my absence
[1:38:21] you know Christian when we get to places
[1:38:23] where nobody is observing us well
[1:38:26] there's no there's no brother no sister
[1:38:28] ah we change
[1:38:32] yes
[1:38:33] your true colors come out
[1:38:36] but what we know that oh in this
[1:38:38] neighborhood hey maybe maybe when as I'm
[1:38:40] going to I may meet somebody I may meet
[1:38:42] a brother or sister you are careful
[1:38:45] but when you go to a place where you are
[1:38:47] sure nobody will meet nobody there God
[1:38:50] is there
[1:38:51] [Applause]
[1:38:55] he is the Unseen eye
[1:38:58] watching you he is unseen here hearing
[1:39:01] every conversation
[1:39:02] [Applause]
[1:39:08] so be careful of yourself
[1:39:13] I say Where can I
[1:39:19] say there's no difference between in the
[1:39:22] sight of God there's no difference
[1:39:23] between Darkness and Light
[1:39:25] because why I think I've gone into the
[1:39:28] best or the the the the the darkest
[1:39:31] place oh that's why you will see me more
[1:39:34] when I I run into the deep seas oh he
[1:39:38] will surely see me he'll find me out we
[1:39:40] cannot hide ourselves from me from him
[1:39:43] if we know these things and we don't
[1:39:45] forget
[1:39:47] it will check our lives wherever we go
[1:39:50] anything that we are doing is even even
[1:39:52] our thoughts he knows them
[1:39:58] our thoughts are so plain to you before
[1:40:00] him
[1:40:03] say we are lonely pregnant
[1:40:06] we are running we can't run from him
[1:40:14] we're just trying to make it to heaven
[1:40:21] you know Abraham once was just closing
[1:40:24] Abraham was once asked to
[1:40:27] sacrifice Isaac
[1:40:31] and
[1:40:33] to my surprise you know Abraham never
[1:40:35] told even Sarah
[1:40:39] is there a wife
[1:40:41] oh Sarah maybe this is what the Lord has
[1:40:43] told me just imagine the the reaction of
[1:40:46] Sarah
[1:40:49] my only son
[1:40:53] my face am I that Sarah would have been
[1:40:56] a stumbling block
[1:41:00] because
[1:41:02] that Vision or that message
[1:41:05] didn't come to Sarah
[1:41:07] it came to Abraham
[1:41:10] it was Abraham who had that message
[1:41:14] so he wouldn't allow anyone to distract
[1:41:17] him
[1:41:18] from believing that message and acting
[1:41:20] upon that message
[1:41:21] [Applause]
[1:41:23] have you heard from God
[1:41:26] oh somebody told you a message
[1:41:30] [Music]
[1:41:34] if you have heard from God
[1:41:37] like Abraham heard from God
[1:41:40] and didn't want any destruction but to
[1:41:43] go ahead and do what was commanded him
[1:41:47] if we have heard from God
[1:41:50] will not allow anything
[1:41:54] to distract us
[1:41:56] you know one Soul had this convention
[1:42:00] we know the story of Soul when he became
[1:42:02] Paul
[1:42:04] and
[1:42:06] he said
[1:42:08] when he hit
[1:42:10] when he had his his
[1:42:13] experience he said immediately
[1:42:16] I conferred not with flesh and blood
[1:42:20] he didn't go Consulting people what do
[1:42:23] you think what's your opinion what is
[1:42:25] this no he heard from Jesus he said I am
[1:42:27] Jesus
[1:42:31] if this message had been revealed to you
[1:42:34] know one thing is that the message is
[1:42:36] real though but you it must be revealed
[1:42:38] to you as an individual
[1:42:39] and so if it is revealed to you as an
[1:42:42] individual at all
[1:42:44] you need no other argument you need no
[1:42:47] other please
[1:42:48] Hallelujah
[1:42:50] you go ahead and do just what the
[1:42:52] message says do
[1:42:58] we just live for him
[1:43:02] he has called us
[1:43:06] Hallelujah
[1:43:11] we have to live for gold
[1:43:13] all the days of our lives
[1:43:16] we have to stand for him
[1:43:19] we have to be faithful in this call
[1:43:25] the last thing Joseph we know the story
[1:43:27] of Joseph
[1:43:28] when Potiphar's wife
[1:43:31] was trying to
[1:43:33] live him
[1:43:36] just soon
[1:43:41] as the point that he was caught
[1:43:45] a face shirt and then run away
[1:43:50] Joseph had allowed it
[1:43:53] nobody would have known about it but God
[1:43:56] will have known about it
[1:43:59] to have had pleasure maybe that would
[1:44:02] have even promoted him more in potipe's
[1:44:05] house but because he ran away he said I
[1:44:08] Fear God I can't do that nobody is here
[1:44:11] watching me but I know my God Is
[1:44:13] Watching Me
[1:44:14] [Applause]
[1:44:16] these two
[1:44:18] and because he did that he had a better
[1:44:20] promotion
[1:44:21] you know we don't know what God has
[1:44:22] himself for you
[1:44:24] a little compromise
[1:44:26] will take you up the favor of God from
[1:44:29] you
[1:44:30] but if we're able to stand
[1:44:32] amen the word of God says it I am a Son
[1:44:35] of God I am a daughter of God I cannot
[1:44:37] do that I cannot betray my God
[1:44:42] tell us individual
[1:44:45] God will take care of the rest
[1:44:47] Hallelujah
[1:44:50] God will take care of it
[1:44:58] I don't care how rotten the world is how
[1:45:01] rotten our country is our nation our
[1:45:03] people
[1:45:11] but we are not interested in prayer
[1:45:13] meetings anymore
[1:45:15] we've got so many things we have to do
[1:45:19] so we think
[1:45:21] oh say what we need today is a calling
[1:45:25] together a getting a getting together
[1:45:28] getting ready and not depending on the
[1:45:31] preacher as I said but you as an
[1:45:34] individual before God
[1:45:36] make yourself ready for the coming of
[1:45:39] the Lord to escape all this corruption
[1:45:42] no matter what they call you and what
[1:45:45] action they take that doesn't change God
[1:45:48] one minute
[1:45:49] God will do it just the same he is
[1:45:52] depending and waiting on
[1:45:58] science are appearing Jesus is coming
[1:46:01] and great Oneness are being done
[1:46:05] every mild post is pointing towards his
[1:46:09] soon appearing

[1:46:13] how are we standing this day he said
[1:46:16] this morning but this is evening
[1:46:18] how are we stand this evening as we take
[1:46:21] inventory

[1:46:43] raised from the dead who have proven
[1:46:46] themselves already

[1:48:15] I am resolved I don't know all the ways
[1:48:19] I got too late
[1:48:27] things
[1:48:29] [Music]
[1:48:39] [Music]
[1:48:45] [Applause]

[1:49:40] [Music]
[1:49:46] [Applause]
[1:49:58] I will promise
[1:50:01] [Music]
[1:50:03] I
[1:50:05] know I know where always
[1:50:12] [Music]
[1:50:18] [Applause]
[1:50:19] [Music]
[1:50:24] [Music]
[1:50:31] [Applause]
[1:50:33] [Music]
[1:50:37] [Applause]
[1:50:43] [Applause]
[1:50:45] everything inside
[1:50:47] [Music]
[1:50:56] go ahead
[1:50:58] sorry I can't keep up with the song but
[1:51:02] we'll pick it up later amen let's give
[1:51:05] the Lord a big clap of
[1:51:10] amen
[1:51:13] what a great message
[1:51:15] amen
[1:51:17] you know
[1:51:20] how many have listened to Discerning of
[1:51:22] the spirit
[1:51:24] the message discern the spirit
[1:51:27] Yeah because sometimes it's easy to get
[1:51:29] in trouble with God
[1:51:31] when we don't discern the spirit of the
[1:51:34] Lord
[1:51:35] but I'm gonna give you a short example
[1:51:38] if you've done something at home
[1:51:41] and nobody knows about it
[1:51:44] and you come here
[1:51:45] and the minister preaches exactly what
[1:51:49] you have done
[1:51:50] without him being at home with you it is
[1:51:54] not a man
[1:51:56] it is God that is talking to you and you
[1:52:00] should be even afraid
[1:52:02] to say one thing against it
[1:52:06] because if that Minister doesn't know
[1:52:09] what he's saying and he said it if you
[1:52:13] attack it you are attacking the word of
[1:52:15] God that has been quickened by the Holy
[1:52:17] Spirit it will cost you something and
[1:52:20] never do that amen
[1:52:23] God spoke
[1:52:25] You Know Who You Are
[1:52:27] we all are called here to be individual
[1:52:31] they are people that are saying
[1:52:33] scripture about Philippians 2 12 exactly
[1:52:37] the same scripture that God spoke here
[1:52:41] I have my Lane
[1:52:43] I'm a pastor you have your name
[1:52:47] you keep your lane
[1:52:48] and do what God sent you to do
[1:52:52] amen amen if you're a song leader stay
[1:52:56] in your lane and be the best song leader
[1:52:59] that you can if you're a backup singer
[1:53:01] stay on your lane do the best that you
[1:53:04] can if you're sitting in the
[1:53:05] congregation stay in your lane if you're
[1:53:08] a husband stay in your lane your wife
[1:53:10] stay in your lane children stay in your
[1:53:13] lane because you will be accountable for
[1:53:16] what you're doing
[1:53:17] amen what what the and the worst thing
[1:53:20] is if a husband does something wrong we
[1:53:23] have wife that cannot stand and say what
[1:53:26] you did is wrong
[1:53:28] they just tally together
[1:53:30] but brother Branham say ananias and
[1:53:32] Safari is coming back
[1:53:34] you will both die
[1:53:37] amen if your wife did something wrong
[1:53:40] amen don't join that sin
[1:53:43] because both of you can fall dead
[1:53:46] because you cooperate
[1:53:48] to keep whatever you want to do together
[1:53:51] so remember I'm not gonna die with you
[1:53:53] if you've done something wrong you are
[1:53:56] individual
[1:53:57] amen amen you are individual one of this
[1:54:00] day you're gonna answer before God as
[1:54:03] individual whatever you do in school God
[1:54:06] sees you that's why God is speaking here
[1:54:09] whatever you do alone God is seeing you
[1:54:11] that's what God is doing here whatever
[1:54:14] you put up first before God whatever
[1:54:17] excuses you're doing whatever you are
[1:54:21] neglecting maybe reading the scripture
[1:54:24] reading the Bible or maybe listening to
[1:54:27] the message or you don't come to church
[1:54:29] the way you're supposed to be or uh
[1:54:31] question and answer don't even matter to
[1:54:34] you whatever you're doing that's between
[1:54:37] you and God I guarantee you and I
[1:54:40] promise to you not when I will face
[1:54:42] Jesus Christ I will have none of your
[1:54:45] blood
[1:54:46] over my hand none of your blood amen
[1:54:50] whether you're mad whether you're not
[1:54:52] happy I'm gonna speak I'm gonna preach
[1:54:55] because what I'm saying here is coming
[1:54:57] from the scripture and from the message
[1:54:59] of the hour as long as I deliver that I
[1:55:02] am free from your blood
[1:55:04] it is up to you to take like the the
[1:55:07] brother say we are student we come to
[1:55:09] church we listen to this you need to go
[1:55:12] home and do your homework
[1:55:14] you need to open the Bible you need to
[1:55:16] pray you need to to to to stay with the
[1:55:19] Lord and doing things yourself
[1:55:22] wake up your own salvation with fear and
[1:55:24] trembling because one of this day you're
[1:55:27] gonna answer for yourself your friend
[1:55:30] will not answer for you amen your
[1:55:33] children and sometimes are fearful
[1:55:35] children and and I and I and I'm
[1:55:37] bleeding for them because sometimes they
[1:55:40] don't have a choice because they're
[1:55:41] depending on the parent
[1:55:43] if the parent don't want to come to
[1:55:45] church the children are stuck at home
[1:55:47] if the parent move the children have to
[1:55:50] be forced to move because not because
[1:55:53] they want to move because the parent
[1:55:54] don't want to move and sometimes they
[1:55:56] are trapped in those kind of situations
[1:55:58] why that's why brother Branham say it's
[1:56:01] not the delinquency of the children it
[1:56:03] comes from the parent
[1:56:05] parents
[1:56:06] look at what we're doing
[1:56:08] remember who you are you are individual
[1:56:11] make sure your relationship between you
[1:56:14] and Jesus Christ nothing interfere give
[1:56:17] God the first place he will add
[1:56:19] everything unto thee if you give him the
[1:56:23] first place amen you are alone do the
[1:56:26] best that you can on your side don't
[1:56:28] wait for the other one to do something
[1:56:31] then you're going to react no you do
[1:56:33] your part
[1:56:34] and let God take care of the remaining
[1:56:37] amen what a wonderful message amen let's
[1:56:41] pray Heavenly Father
[1:56:44] Lord once again tonight
[1:56:46] we really appreciate you father
[1:56:49] and we thank you for speaking to us
[1:56:53] and reminding us insisting into the
[1:56:57] holiest
[1:56:59] father whoever is still
[1:57:01] outside the Tabernacle
[1:57:04] whoever is still lingering
[1:57:07] in the other court
[1:57:09] whoever is in the holiest
[1:57:12] that is still after the people
[1:57:15] Lord may you be merciful to them tonight
[1:57:21] father may you give a personal
[1:57:23] revelation
[1:57:27] father whatever Bridges
[1:57:31] that we have not burned
[1:57:35] and these bridges are not only natural
[1:57:38] but maybe spiritual Bridges
[1:57:41] maybe event in the past
[1:57:44] that we still hold on to it
[1:57:47] and those events
[1:57:50] those experiences those souvenirs those
[1:57:54] memories
[1:57:55] are blocking us to move forward
[1:57:58] father may you give your children the
[1:58:00] ability to be able to burn them
[1:58:04] to be able to let it go
[1:58:07] to be able to forsake Him
[1:58:10] and to look forward
[1:58:13] to the high calling that is lying ahead
[1:58:15] of us
[1:58:20] father I commit this church unto the
[1:58:22] hand
[1:58:23] I commit those that are streaming unto
[1:58:26] their hand
[1:58:27] I commit those that are struggling
[1:58:30] unto their hand Lord whatever the devil
[1:58:33] is troubling them to keep them away from
[1:58:36] your promises
[1:58:38] father may you help them
[1:58:40] pass
[1:58:42] all the way to the holiest
[1:58:44] where the presence of the Lord is there
[1:58:48] and where it's Joy regardless of what is
[1:58:51] going on on the outside
[1:58:54] father may you strengthen brother Samuel
[1:58:58] maybe sometime people don't understand
[1:59:02] what a man is facing
[1:59:04] and what he's going through Lord
[1:59:07] father you took his wife home
[1:59:10] but he's still standing
[1:59:12] for your gospel
[1:59:14] and he's still pushing moving forward
[1:59:17] Lord
[1:59:19] father remember him
[1:59:21] and continue to give him strength Lord
[1:59:24] father to carry his duty
[1:59:27] all the way until we meet you into the
[1:59:30] air Lord
[1:59:31] father protect your children Lord as
[1:59:34] they go into their respective Place may
[1:59:36] you keep us all consecrated
[1:59:39] and may father you bring your children
[1:59:42] into a time of meditation where they can
[1:59:46] examine their life
[1:59:47] and compare it not with their neighbor
[1:59:50] not with the husband not with the wife
[1:59:55] but compare their life individually
[1:59:58] with the word to make sure
[2:00:01] that they're standing on good ground
[2:00:04] and they can make it to the Rapture Lord
[2:00:06] and if they find out
[2:00:08] by the enlightening of the holy spirit
[2:00:11] that the nurse where they're supposed to
[2:00:13] be
[2:00:14] father give them strength and Grace to

[2:00:38] Lord house

[2:00:43] may you be merciful to your children
[2:00:45] where else can we go to find solution
