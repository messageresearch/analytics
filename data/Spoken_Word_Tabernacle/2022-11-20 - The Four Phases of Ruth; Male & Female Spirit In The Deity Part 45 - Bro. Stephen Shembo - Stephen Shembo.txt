issues but they just didn't know it was going to happen that quickly um sister Yogi Beth is not here this morning she's running a fever so let's remember her we certainly miss her presence here this morning and also I have a prayer request here all it says is baby not feeling well so that's sister Angela Wright okay so we'll pray for that little precious baby as well I believe she's she's got about eight mothers here so okay she got who was it said something about she got passed around like a sack of taters last night or yesterday but that's wonderful it takes a village doesn't it takes

are ordered of the Lord and Lord Jesus Christ you know everything that happens in our lives and you know there's a purpose Lord and Lord you know the reason that Teresa and I wasn't able to make it yesterday Lord and He grieved both our hearts we wanted to be there so bad we were ready to go well Lord working on the railroad I found out that there's such little things can derail a train but Lord when the train gets derailed you don't leave it there you just put it back on the track and keep it going so Lord we're back on track Lord and we're just grateful to you Lord and Lord I just pray Lord Jesus Christ that you help us Lord to be attentive to your very whim your very will your very desire for our lives Lord Lord this is this is not a joke this is not a time for playing games this is not a time to be a church member this is examining time oh Father help each one of us Lord work we've come to the house of God because it's a house of correction and Lord I want to be corrected Lord

are not able to receive the message on WhatsApp so everybody you you're the only one so talk to Brother David if he can give it to you anybody else so either you didn't read it or you are behind your messages I have been sending a lot of messages and once I sent a message it's not in my responsibility anymore in other words if you are not up to the message that will send that is your own responsibility amen my responsibility is to send it but I'm not going to be at home telling you to read your own message so it's your responsibility to make sure you're up to date with the sermon or with the the the messages or the quotes that has been sent there amen but Lord's willing I would like to have whatever I send in a message on December 3rd here amen so make sure you make it there if you can if you cannot make it do not operate in this church you didn't hear me if you miss that meeting and you play an instrument do not play an instrument anymore until you talk to me if you miss that meeting and you know you're in a choir when they call the choir do not come up here because I don't want you to operate differently amen you must ask your question you might ask yourself a question why am I going that direction we started this church in December 2019. that's when we left the old church that's when we started this church and the first service in a hotel was in this in January 2020 and I was the one who preached the first service out there and then seven months later we went through the election and I was elected as a pastor so from December 2019 to almost December this year you are three years old you're no longer and a baby so the level of Tolerance is no longer there glory to God the Bible says in Acts chapter 17 verse 30. that and the time of this ignorance God winked at so there is a time that God went at your ignorance because you don't know what you're doing or maybe you are growing up in a faith and there are certain things that the Lord will tolerate amen usually the way I operate I must see something I will not do anything to it until I get a signal from the headquarter that's now it's time to move on and to do it that's how I learned from Brother Branham that's why brother Branham say that Paul became a prisoner because Paul learned to wait on to the Lord until the Lord zeroed in everything and say go ahead and do what you got to do that's the reason why that woman keep following Paul and Paul was not able to do anything brother random said he was waiting until they gave him a signal and once they give a signal then you know that everything is on time you can move on and do what you got to do amen so I receive a comment from someone online and I really appreciate the men who sent the comment and in conjunction to the comment brother John mentioned something on the musician chat so with those two coming together at the same time personally the way I'm LED with the Lord I felt that this is the time now that I need to address certain things that probably you don't know because you were not taught well amen so I'm not saying that you did something bad you did it ignorantly because you didn't know now it's time to start showing you certain things and once it's shown to you once it's revealed to you you you must walk at that level do you understand what I'm saying Paul says this he says the time of this ignorance God winked at but now no more ignorance commanded all men everywhere to do water repent so there is a time that God is quiet and there is a time that God will require you to do something amen Paul says in First Corinthians chapter 13 I read this on due on Wednesday he says when I was a child I speak like what a child and I understood as water and I taught us what so you are three years old in the ministry amen and Paul said but when I became a man I put away water so we reach a level that certain things need to go now amen let me give you an example just to help you see what I'm saying brother Branham says here that I don't see nothing he was taken he was talking about the women here he said I don't see nothing on taking on or taking off of her there unless the woman wants he says if she says she has to cut it then let her shave it off how sleep because the scriptures say a woman should not shave her hair we already went through this in the hotel if you want to do it you better give move everything but brother Branham continues he said because if she does not let her have her hair because her hair is her water covering but for a man to have his head covered comma long hair like a water woman it's a problem you must say this picture here look like having long hair brother Branham says this he say you say well my hair is long and it's done to my water shoulders that will shorten crust you say Christ had long hair no he never cross the head shoulder left hair that's what you see there so they say they just pull it around this way and cut it off shoulder length hair look at the Greek word on that in there and you shall find out so in the Bible time what you see here was called shorter hair you will catch up on me later right about them say a man should not have long hair because it is water feminist way down long like this but he just cut it off here and he showed her where they cut it off around his head just bobbed it off like that that was water short hair so a man should not wear a long hair but I'm gonna say something the Bible says that when the woman at the well met Jesus Christ he said how can you be a what can you say it louder so Jesus Christ was a Jew and Jewish hair are not black people here do you hear me so don't come in this church and keep your hair longer because you want to resemble this one that was a Jewish hair if you're a black man you don't have Jewish hair don't do this cut your hair clean we're not Mavericks in this church you don't have to say Amen I am fine what I'm trying to say by that brother Branham say but for a man to have his hair covered long like a water woman standing in the water he looked like a woman up there mine brother Branham is saying if a man have long hair standing on the pulpit when people look at that man over there they will think that man is a woman in other words a woman should not stand on this pulpit a sister should not come over here and stand on this pulpit all the singers should be standing right here hmm glory to God we talked about this Tabernacle and this Tabernacle has how many parts three the Tabernacle have three parts if I Don't Preach that's okay if you can get this only we have the first part is called water they are the court and the second one is called what the holy place we call this the sanctuary remember we went through this the first century and the third one was water the holiest of all this one was called the second century everybody okay why what are you trying to say with a tabernacle and about people singing and standing here it's indifferent language but you gotta learn it now now we need to teach you you didn't know before now you need to know brother Branham say then when the building was assembled together and all completed Solomon called the day of water dedication that Tabernacle of Solomon was built just exactly like water here brother Branham is saying that the way they built the Tabernacle that's the way they built the Branham Tabernacle if you look at Branham Tabernacle does he resemble the Tabernacle of Solomon or the Temple of Solomon how does he look like it it's a different language don't worry brother Branham say the congregation is what the court can you say Amen so when you are entering this church everywhere from from here where you are sitting there in the eyes of God you already in the other court I know maybe you never heard something never never heard something like this that's why we're going through this brother Branham said the congregation where you are is the water cool Karma and what followed the court if you are in the other court what follow the other quote and brother Branham called that water whoever is on the computer makes sure all these quotes are ported up there so don't be behind me or ahead of me Let's Stay Together in harmony brother Branham say the other court is the congregation What followed the other court the holy place and the holy Place brother Branham called that water so when you're entering the church this place right here is your holy place am I reading something different let's go up with our level Amen brother Branham say and the water holiest of holy what do you think the holiest should be then what do you think it is brother Branham said but look let me pull this up brother Branham say and standing here with this bubble on the water come out the water the water to heaven on water why brother Branham called that [Applause] keep soaking it it will help you out brother Branham said but look at the principle they had to come to look what they had to stand for look how they had to have this common place of Fellowship let this water Tabernacle always stand for those water which was intact then now it is the water so the congregation is the other court this place right here at the altar is the holy place and your Pulpit is what is called the holiest back amen you're going to understand that later bye and by I have to preach it it's up to you to catch up to what I'm saying you think it's a deduction let me help you up more brother Branham say I just asked any man to produce scripture for a woman water preacher I can't I can prove to you that in the Old Testament as Paul say even so say the water I was looking in the crown uh in the chronology of the Old Testament yesterday and I found in there that where they had special water police that a woman could not even come to the water what is the second call all the water the turtle is called water the third Court LED alone in the water so if they call you to sing something special don't stand here if you heard me say Amen all musicians stand right here like you did with sister Victoria and sister Olivia praise the Lord you were right on the correct line where you were if they call you you sing over there in this puppet here on this song leader get here only preacher get here only the pastor get here only the Deacon get here or they trusty if he wanna say something to the church if you're not in that order when they call you stand over there when they call the choir stand behind here you say brother Stephen we under the levitical priesthood we are not under the levitical priesthood we under the Melchizedek priesthood God opened the way that's why women can come to the Altar and they can pray women can step all the way here and they can sing but because the Covenant never change between a man and a woman and the man is still the head Paul say I do not give the woman the right to come to the pulpit and take authority because of that that is what is keeping the woman away under the melchized foreign sister you can step all the way here but because of what Paul kept the Covenant that changed after sin man still the head that's why the woman cannot come here if he was not for that the sister who would have a right to get here it's a different language that was just an appetizer Paul says this he said nevertheless well too we have already watered in other words we have reached a certain level with the church he said let us walk by the same room let us man the same water if you reach a certain level you need now to move to that level in other words I cannot tolerate anybody operating in this church under the standard you rather sit down did you hear me the remaining I'll talk to you in December 3rd Paul said Paul spoke to Timothy he said no man that worth a soldier entangle himself with the affair of water that he may please him who has water chosen him to be a water so if you are you are boarded to serve the Lord whether musician weather singer whether on the computer there whether on the sound system whether you are an officer whether a deacon whether a trustee whether uh uh I mean a treasure whatever you're doing if you are embarked in those offices you must stop you masturbide by what that office is calling you cannot be in those offices and you are entangling with the things of life in other words the work of God is neglected because you are so busy it is better for you to leave it is better for you not to play on the instrument if you cannot consecrate yourself it will be better for you to sit down then try to temper here you grown up see you on December 3rd let's go with the scripture it's a different language buddy happened probably never heard it I don't blame you now that you know you know what it is you go home pick up this sermon go get the code go verify those quote I didn't change anything and I don't change things on brother Brian I'm coach I know what they are because I know somebody's looking at me like where he's going with it yeah it is the word of God that's the congregation this is the holy place this is the holiest place that's the way it is now you're growing up you are mature Now by God's grace you need to know certain things and let's Now operate under that so we can be pleasing to the Lord and keeping moving amen yeah when God pull you to a certain level you cannot stay where you are those that stay on the looter became denomination because they didn't want to move with God those that stay on the Wesley denomination they didn't want to move with Pentecost those that stay on the Pentecostal denomination they didn't want to move with the entire message so when the opening when the when the Revelation open up you step with that revelation everybody okay I will never lower the standard to accommodate you or to fix you I'm not gonna do that you are the one that need to change your schedule and change everything that you do to cope with what you are in if it's a problem we will sit down and talk either we're going to shift you and say okay you go to this position because this one is not good for you or we will ask you probably this is not the time make sure you take care of your business in life when you're going to be free to serve the Lord you can come back and we can serve the Lord fully we have nothing to do with a personal problem so don't make it personal are you understanding me so don't come and make it personal I don't have a problem with anybody okay but if I tell you you need to move and go over there I'm not saying that because I have a problem with you I'm saying that for your protection and to help you out so don't make it personal don't make it personal do not make it personal okay let's go to Genesis chapter 2. yes don't bring bring your this family the problem this family the problem talking to this one talking to this one and then I have a problem no no no no don't make it personal all I'm saying is sister you're too busy take your time consecrate yourself when you're ready then you can come back and continue to play instrument you have nothing personal amen that's it if the door in the morning is not open the first time it's not open the second time it's not open the third time I would take the keys off the door I would do my best to be there on time so don't take it personal if I take the keys out Genesis chapter 2. I already warned you Genesis chapter 2 verse 7. if you dare you can say amen I want you to stay awake this is a different language completely stay awake give me time stay awake it's a different language okay Genesis 2 verse 7. if you dare you can say amen amen and the Lord God formed man of the dust off the ground you know what it means and breathe into his nostril the breath of life and he became a what living Soul you might be seated job to verse 18. and the Lord God say it is not good for the man that man should be what alone so this man is a natural man and this man that was created naturally he appeared to be alone because he was one person when you look at him naturally you only see one being amen verse 19 let me drop down to verse 20 for the sake of time and Adam gave name to okada and to the fall of the air and to every beast of the field but for Adam there was not found a what help me whoever missed the church and you're going to stream later make sure you abide with what was spoken this morning but Adam was not found a help meet for him and the Lord God calls a deep sleep to fall upon Adam and he slept and he took one of his ribs so in other words before Eve can be pulled out from the body of Adam Adam must be completely asleep Adam must be completely sleeping and not just a slit by the Deep one when he went to a deep sleep he could not even move that's when God pulled the woman the woman we went through that last Sunday the woman using a rib amen glory to God and close up the flesh instead thereof and the rib which the Lord God has taken from man made he a water woman and brought her to man and Adam say this is now you remember Sunday born of my born and Flesh of My Flesh she shall be called the water if you notice here Adam say that she is born of his born and flesh of his flesh in other words the body of Eve the body of Eve was not different than the body of Adam everybody okay in other words the body of Eve was the body of Adam in female version because Adam didn't say this is somebody else's body this is somebody else born he said no no no no no no no this is my born and this is my flesh so when you're looking at Eve you're looking at Adam in a feminine in a female version stay alert everybody okay therefore shall man leave his father and his mother and shall cling to his wife and they shall be water one flesh and they were both naked the man and his wife and were not wanted let's go to Genesis chapter 5 verse one this is the book of the generation of Adam in the day that God created man in his in the likeness of God made he him he made him how male and female created he them and God blessed them and called their name So Adam is male and he's female and Adam is the name for the mayor and the female so what you call Eve was not ease the name of Eve was Adam she became Eve when she seen everybody okay go to roof chapter 2. let's see how the Lord will help us here I'm going to skip a lot of them for the sake of time let's go to verse 11. and Boaz answer and say to her he has fully been shown to me all that you have done to your mother in Lord since the death of your husband and how you have left your father like Abraham did your mother and the land of your Nativity exactly the faith of Abraham and now come to a people which you knew not before the Lord welcome past your work that work was a work of faith amen and a full reward be giving you of the Lord God of Israel under whose wings we know it's the Tabernacle you are come to the water so roof was after the full reward what is the full reward go to chapter 3. verse 1 the Bible says this the Naomi her mother-in-law said to her my daughter Shala not seek water so Ruth being in Israel working in a field of Boaz was not enough staying with Naomi was not enough she was not in rest yet everybody okay whatever happened in Israel she was that she did not have rest yet what is this restaurant amen how do you find the rest this is the way you found rest that he may be well with you and now he's not Boaz Our Kingdom with whose Maiden you were that's in the past amen behold he we knoweth Barney tonight in the water if you notice here it's Boaz working for you to find your rest you need to go where Boaz himself is working everybody okay let's go to Ephesians and then we pray help me give me time and let's handle this verse 23 you already understand now what a woman is how to respect the sister and what is the position of the sister how she need to be submitted to her husband if you play around with those two things you're going to get yourself in trouble with God amen verse 23 for the husband is the head of the what that's why women cannot come here because the Covenant is still kept everybody okay if it was not for this sister would have been appearing here that's why Paul said a woman cannot even preach everybody okay even as Christ is the head of the water then he is the savior of the water so the church is the body the Church of God is the body of God the Church of God is the body of God let me keep that way amen job to verse 28. Hallelujah no you can get this go back to verse 24. I cannot skip this therefore as the church is subject to Christ so let the wives be to their own husband in water husbands love your water we went through that on Sunday even as Christ also loved her church and gave himself for water in other words you give your wife Jesus they love you must love your wife is the love of Jesus Christ how can you love your wife who like Jesus if you don't have Jesus [Applause] that's why a man before he get married he must meet Christ he must have the Holy Ghost if not he cannot give Christ to his wife walk on the love are you gonna give to your wife if you are not born again a Hollywood lover a freshly love you cannot even answer a question about the Bible [Applause] Hallelujah he said I said that Hima sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of the Water by the water word you stay up whoever in a computer and here stay up with me please amen that he might present it to himself a water so the purpose of God God wants to present himself not just the church he want to present himself a church that is how why glorious why a glorious Church a glorious Church having not having water or water or any such water but that it should be how holy and without water so this church must be holy and this church must be without water with a blemish Hallelujah he continued he says so ought man to love the water how can you express that love if you don't have God Paul is saying this is the way a man should love his wife how are you God brother Branham saying you don't draw blood out of Eternity because there is no blood to begin with so you get in your Hollywood husband and you want the husband to Love You Like Jesus Christ this is why you get beaten this is why you disappointed you're trying to judge Jesus Christ out of a man that doesn't have Jesus Christ the staff of God does and not interest him when it's church he will find the reason when it's a house meeting he will find a reason not to be there everything that concerned God he's not there [Applause] so ought men to love the wife as their own water bodies he that love his wife love of water himself so the wife is your body so the body of a man the body of Eve is the body of who Adam it's a formula everybody okay for we are members of his water where is our weight 22 28 go to 29. for no man ever yet hated his own water flesh so the body of God is the Flesh of God that's why Adam said this is Flesh of My Flesh everybody okay nobody he said for no man ever hated his own flesh but does what nourishes in other words seeds it and do water care for it even as the Lord the water so we are members of his water body so this church is our so-called members everybody okay we are members of his body amen of his flesh and of his water that's why Adam says Flesh of My Flesh and born of my born now Paul is saying that Jesus Christ also have his flesh of his flesh and bonds of his bone his flesh of his Flesh and Bones of his bones is what they call his church everybody okay glory to God verse 31 for this course shall a man leave his father and mother and shall be drawn to his water why and they too shall be water one flesh this is a great Water mystery but I speak concerning who and the water everything that I explain you here is a great mystery everybody okay keep those words here and let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we are approaching you humbly this morning thanking you once again father for your grace for your love and your mercy and for everything you have been doing for us father this is as far as I can go as a human being that you have given ability to be able to read the Holy Scripture and be even able to be found worthy to read Lord father the worthy message that you have sent unto us in this Center Lord may you move me completely out of the way and may you move also the congregation out of the way so that Lord father you'll be the one speaking and the one Hearing in the heart of your children may every demonic Spirit contrary to your word live completely this place may you be the Alpha and the Omega of this service as we commit everything unto the hand in the name of Jesus Christ amen the way I will be traveling with this sermon is this according to First Corinthians chapter 15 The Bible say and so it is written the first man who Adam so we have a first Adam we have Adam the first the first one amen Adam the first one was made a living soul and we explained that brother Branham say he was a living Soul he means that he was a soul that cannot die because God injected into him eternal life you remember that but there is another Adam that is called the last Adam he's the second or the last last so you don't bring another third Adam the last Adam he is not a living soul but he is a quickening spirit he's a quickening spirit means that he is the one that give life he is the one that gives you the Holy Ghost that's why John the Baptist says that I John the Baptist baptize you with water water but there is somebody else that is coming after me that person will baptize you with what Holy Ghost and what that's why he is the Adam that quickened the spirit he's the one that gives eternal life if you don't have eternal life he's the one that will come and Quicken you so that you can receive eternal life so the way I'm gonna travel we will be traveling with the first Adam and the last Adam or the second Adam the first Adam is what Paul is referring here in the book of Ephesians as Adam and Eve then when he changed here he said this is about Christ and the what church over here it's about Adam and Eve so we have a natural Adam amen and we have over here a spiritual Adam everybody okay so keep those thoughts in mind this is how we're traveling my subject this morning is the four phases of roof male and female spirit in the deity everybody okay Adam was both male and female everybody can say Amen to that everybody can agree with that everybody takes it without any problem because it's very easy to see brother Charles and to see sister Keller the two two people everybody can see that without any problem now I'm not talking about the male and the female in the human being we already seen that today I'm talking about a mayor and a female spirit in the digity amen that's why I say stay up we're still dealing with the second oil whoever is on the computer please keep those quotes up roof was here in the uh in the field of Boaz working with the maiden we got two type of women we got who roof the bride to be and the other women that were working together just exactly like roof but they never became the the wife of Boaz the only one that continued and progress all the way to rest was only roof and roof alone according to Matthew 25 we got also two type of women we got the wise version and we also got the word the foolish virgin and the Bible says that and why they want to buy the bridegroom came and they that were already went in with him into the water so those that were ready were those that had the second oil because the Bible said in the Book of Revelation 19 that the marriage of the Lamb has come and his blood has made herself how do you make yourself ready you make yourself ready by making sure you have the second oil what are you trying to say brother Stephen brother Branham says in the Philadelphia churches he said don't you remember the sleeping virgin when she raised up now remember what what she call there is 10 of them went out to meet the bridegroom is that right five was wise had oil in their lamp how many knows what all signified in the Bible is signify water you okay the oil signify the spirit but we got the first oil and we also got the water second oil the first oil was carried by the women amen but the second all opened up only when the bridegroom came everybody okay glory to God he says now one could not say you are not Sanctified I'm not there was all Sanctified all of them were virgin every one of them all water is everybody awake all of them sanctify but five was wise enough what does this wisdom mean to have the wisdom of water revelation and we know according to Paul Paul says that Christ is the wisdom of God we went through this before now brother Branham say the wise virgin that had the second oil or the wise virgin that that entered all the way to the marriage brother Branham said they had the wisdom of Revelation and the wisdom of God is Christ in other words these women had the true reference Center of Jesus Christ thank you glory to God brother Branham said that was wise enough to have the wisdom of Christ or direction of Christ the wisdom of Revelation to catch the water and the door is who seek to be filled with the water so in order to be to receive the Holy Ghost you must know where to find the door and you must have the revelation of that door and that door is closed what are you saying brother Stephen brother Branham said Paul was down there in the natural realm with his PhD see he didn't know he had a water intellectual Faith enter can you give him more volume please he has a made difference in me having an intellectual Faith then a Divine faith that is where you my Baptist friend failed to go on you get the intellectual Faith by that but it must be a water revelation of who Jesus Christ to you that that's what take sin out of the water and to let your faith is not enough Hallelujah that's all right but it only bring you to the water in other words you need knowledge first to know how God operate and that knowledge will bring you closer but you need to move from the head knowledge to a heart knowledge to understand who Christ is brother Branham said the holy spirit is a personal experience of water of the birth the new water regeneration making a new creature in water glory to God after the opening of the seals what is the new birth then you say well brother pranam what is the new birth it is the revelation of Jesus Christ personally to you amen not you join the church you shook a hand you done something different you say the Creed you promised to live by a code of law but it's who Christ the Bible he is the word that was revealed to you and no matter what anybody says what takes place it is who right right whether it's a pastor or a priest whatever it might be it is Christ in who you that is the Revelation that the church was built upon what Revelation are you talking about that seals to reveal who is everybody awake all right let me keep moving brother Branham say the new birth is Christ is a water revelation God has revealed to you this water great mystery now we begin to talk God has revealed to you water a great mystery God has revealed to you water great Mysteries yes sir everybody okay so that's why you need to know what is the token when which token are you pointing the people to [Applause] everybody okay God have revealed to you this water and that is a new water now what are you going to do when you get all that group together where the Revelation is perfectly in water and God is expressing through his water by the same action the same thing that he did making the world water oh if the church only know each water he will one day [Applause] thank you everybody okay then if you win one day then the Rapture will water go when he knows what it is now notice we need this message God is known by the Simplicity of the water Revelation revelation of water Jesus Christ you don't need to go to school that's why he took us not a theology it is a revelation of who Jesus Christ Upon This Rock I will build My Water Church no other rock is accepted no other thing is accepted nor the Roman Rock nor the Protestant Rock no other school no other nothing but on exactly the water revelation of Jesus Christ through the water he Bonds in there and inject his own life and your life is water and the life of Christ is projecting itself through with the water how can you not if God preeminence and you claim to have the Holy Ghost when they call you about the freaks of God you don't want to come and you're telling me you have the Holy Ghost that's your own Holy Ghost it won't get you there amen with the water plural to the water people that they see the very water and Water Works and water and water that he did is doing the same thing through her so it is not just a talk it is a life and that life have also worked [Applause] glory to God outside of that the rest is not even water if that don't produce this one you don't have it you are 10 years in a message fan you don't have it [Music] I was born in a message fan you don't have it Bridget yes everybody okay Watch God's Great Water Revelation doing water and forwarding by lack of disgravation is why we have so many water different divisions [Applause] do you see the problem in the message do you see why we have division in a message because the preacher themselves never got the revelation of the message that's why they are troubling the people all over we learn how to do emotions we learned how to run here and there we learn how to be good speakers by zero life he said by lack of this Revelation is why we have so many different water how can one message produce so many doctrines [Applause] how how Paul received the revelation of Jesus Christ Paul never met Peter but when Paul and Peter met they were preaching the same thing amen amen by lack of this Revelation is why we have so many water different among us and so many so much water they make fun of the seals they make fun of the Thunders because of this and so much division Among Us is because the people lack water the teacher that went through lack the Revelation what were they teaching before the wise virgin head oil you need an oil that's going to help you now according to Genesis 1 verse 26 amen God created man glory to God the Bible say he created man in his own image and in his own likeness and he created them and God called them what Adam follow me carefully I'm gonna call this circle God everybody okay now God in Genesis 1 26 he created man the Bible never said he created a woman the word woman came when Eve was pulled out of Adam everybody okay follow me carefully in Genesis 1 26 God created a man not a woman but this man was double oh he was a dual man inside this man inside this man that looked like God there was a male and there was a female everybody okay if you take the female off of this man this man is no longer man are we okay are we okay are we okay if you take the man off of this man this man is no longer man to be man he must be double he must be man and he must be also a woman it's a different language buddy everybody okay that is why in Genesis this is Genesis 1 26. that is why in Genesis 2 verse 7 when God created man everybody okay In the Flesh in the biology in the genetics of this man he is also XY because he must be both mayor and water everybody okay this man of Genesis 1 was a spirit man he was a man that was invisible nobody can see him he was just like a spirit because God is a spirit himself according to First John chapter 4 we went through that and if this man is created in the image of God and the likeness of God this man must be a spirit because God was a spirit everybody okay but in Genesis 2 verse 7 this man is not a spiritual man he is a natural man everybody okay now the Bible says that when God was talking here God used the terminology let us so God wants us that God was plural everybody okay when God moved man singular when you look inside that man singular that man singular also was plural everybody okay and when he moved this man from the spirit into a man naturally amen for some reason this man appear visibly to be alone everybody okay if you go into the spiritual Dimension if you look here you will see God too if you look at man you will see man too but when you jump in the Garden of Eden and you say Adam you will see Adam coming up alone you will expect to have Adam with somebody else beside him but when Adam comes to you he's alone what is going on [Applause] remember I'm traveling with the first Adam and the water everybody okay so the first Adam when he is created naturally he's created one person and he is a man or a man that's why the Bible say Adam was a son of God not a daughter of God everybody okay when God created the second Adam are we okay because this man here is the second Adam that's right that's right everybody okay when God created the second Adam which was the Lord Jesus Christ when Jesus Christ appeared on the scene Jesus Christ appeared as a man and he was a man that was alone and he was called also the son of God glory to God in Luke 3 verse 38 the Bible said which was the son of in us which was the son of Seth which was the son of who the son of Adam Karma which was the son of who So Adam was the son of God not a daughter of God because he was a male everybody okay now in the making of Jesus Christ the second Adam Isaiah said unto us a water so that child we don't know whether it's a male or a female we don't know if it's going to be a daughter of God or he's going to be a Son of God so I say I need to provide us with more information so Isaiah said unto us a child is born Karma unto us a water why Jesus have to come as a son let me continue and to as our son is given and the government shall be upon he's not her his shoulder and his name Shall be Called water wonderful Karma and water and water so this son is the Mighty God [Music] the Son of God is God amen what do you think Adam is if he's a son of God Adam is water Adam is water the Bible said didn't the Lord say that God called them water everybody okay he's the Mighty God Karma the Everlasting water how can the son be their father I told you to stay alert this son is also a father so who gave birth to the son is a self-existing everybody okay he said this dad is going to be Mighty God the Everlasting father the prince of water peace in Revelation 12 verse 5 and she brought forth a water a man shall not a woman child a man child that wants to rule all the nation with a road of iron and her child was caught up onto water God and to his water through the child was caught up unto God in other words God sucked the child because remember when Jesus was going up a cloud came open up and Jesus entered the cloud and the cloud everybody okay he was a caught up unto God and unto his water so the first Adam physically he was alone but spiritually he's male and female now when Jesus Christ came physically we seen a man walking alone if you look at Jesus he doesn't have a wife everybody okay glory to God now in First Corinthians chapter 11 this is where we stop last Sunday Paul say for a man indeed ought not to cover his head why for as much as he is water Adam naturally Adam naturally was one man amen first Adam Jesus Christ which is the second and last Adam naturally when you look at him he was one man amen now Paul is saying that for as much as he the man is the image and the glory of water God Paul is saying when you look at men everybody okay man naturally is one person and this man that look naturally as one person is the image and the glory of God because God is always one open Ephesians chapter four we aware in a vision father follow me carefully please Ephesians chapter four if you dare you can say Amen why is man the image of God and not the woman hear your Israel the Lord your God is what is what do you expect Adam to be too hear or Israel the Lord your God is how many God so if Adam come do you want Adam to be killed if he's too he doesn't look like God to look like God other must be one everybody okay everybody okay go to uh Ephesians 4 verse 4 if you dare you can say amen amen where am I Ephesians 4 4. I hope I got the right scripture that's what I was looking for for everybody okay all right the Bible says there is how many body one body Kama and water one Spirit come out even as you are caught into one hope of your calling verse five and what who is Father of water who is above and through water and in Utah how many favor one how many baptisms how many gods how many spirits how many body when how do you expect Adam to show up that's why man is in the image and in the likeness of who God everybody okay where are you going you ready let's read it now a man indeed ought not to cover his head for as much as he is the image and the glory of who God we understand now because God is one God if he is one God everything is single single single we understand that so when Adam is created he looks one person now let's go to the other one but are you okay the woman is the glory of the man not of God I'll let you soak that in everybody okay man is the glory of God but the woman is not the glory of God I'm going slowly a woman is the glory of man what does he mean in other words when you see Adam physically he's not supposed to be glorious are you following me please check somebody's head let me start it again let me sound it again if you see something that is glorious on your side how do you react to it how if you see something that looks glorious how do you react to it you'll be like wow everybody okay but now they say that if you look at Adam Adam is the glory of God but the glory of Adam was not Adam the glory of Adam was if everybody okay another word the glory of Adam was completely hidden in his come on I'm going slowly everybody okay another word if you look at Adam Adam doesn't have anything glorious [Applause] do you follow me in other words Adam was not beautiful [Applause] do you follow me So when you say where is Adam if Adam comes out you will see him that he doesn't look beautiful [Music] if you look at the tiger you look at the Target man the tiger male is beautiful you look at the lion the man of a lion he's beautiful more than a female every Square Every Creature the man is always beautiful but when you look at Adam he doesn't look beautiful the glory of Adam is not in Adam [Applause] do you follow me do you follow me do you follow me if you wanna see the beauty of Adam the beauty of the Adam is never seen another do you follow me in other words Adam was not beautiful everybody okay if the first Adam who was in the image of God was not beautiful and the second Adam who was the image the visible image of the invisible God was also one person do you expect Jesus to be beautiful open Isaiah let's go to Isaiah 53. God help me if you are worrying we good in time so forget about the time let me preach let's go to Isaiah 53. if you dare you can say Amen a few people [Applause] who has belief I'll report you okay buddy Angelo you got it thank you who else believes our report and to whom the arm of the Lord is water for he shall grow up before him as a water plant and as a root out of dragon he has water no food no water why is Jesus not having any form because he is the second other why is Jesus not having why is it somebody that is calmly why do you think it just happened by any chance at the opening of the seventh Shield the Bible became a new he said he has no form no comliness and when we shall see him because the people were expecting God they say oh God is coming one day oh praise the Lord we're going to see God so we're gonna see somebody glorious who's coming up you see him flashing light gold coming up that will be when everybody will fall oh praise the Lord you the master of everything I say I say no no no no no let me give you a preview of his portrait the day you gonna see him you will miss him if you are geared to be attracted by shiny things you will miss that guy that God when he comes you look at him he won't look beautiful let's continue he said and when we shall see him come out there is no water that we should water desire him he is you okay my brother here's how despised and water rejected rejected of man a man of water acquainted with water and we hid as he wear our water faces he wants water in other words when you see him you don't even want to see him you are hiding your face he said that's the man that is God in other words when he come he meets you on the hallway you say because in him there is no water why is not building him why he must not have a beauty let's go to Isaiah 52. glory to God Hallelujah drop to verse 13. we were on 53 let's go to verse uh 13 a few days you can say man amen amen the Bible says behold my servant there is a scripture in Matthew that said Jesus was the servant of God beyond my servant shall deal prudently he shall be exalted and external and be very water high as many were astonished at you he is what you know what he means right his face his face was so water more than Amy water and he's far more than the sons of water in other words when they will try to kill this man the little be the beauty he has man will destroy it completely at the cross until when you look at him he doesn't look like a human being anymore on the cross let's go back now to Paul Paul says as much as man is the image and the glory of who man is the image and the glory of God amen but Paul says that but the woman is the glory of who the man in other words when you look a man man is not beautiful everybody okay the beauty of Adam was healing inside of Adam everybody okay if you want to see her Adam is beautiful how Adam is glorious you need to find the wife of Adam [Music] [Applause] the wife of Adam if you want to gauge how Adam look like you need to see his wife his wife tells you who Adam is amen Adam in the natural he came out one man and God said I'm gonna create his help we thought hey he's going to create his help so God is going to take another dirt and make something if he does that it's contrary to what he studied what he started was one person double you remember now if one person is double if I will need to make Eve where should I get Eve I need to go get his inside of Hope in other words Adam in his body has also two being hidden there everybody okay and one being called Eve was the one who is possible for the glory of Adam so as long as if doesn't come out you will never know the beauty of Adam you will never know the glory of Adam you will never have an idea how great Adam is [Applause] are we okay if the body of the first Adam has two person Adam and Eve and the body of Jesus Christ came also with one person what do you think is also inside the body of Jesus Christ what's up [Applause] come on Hallelujah William Marion brother but do what remember let's go my brother but do whatever remember he went down with you in what [Music] sit God had never separated the water the bride from the water yet so when God looked down upon the Water the body of who of Christ slowly slowly the body of Hope Christ he saw above water and water female foreign so that Jesus that was walking on Galilee was not alone Jesus Christ there was a man and a female that were hidden in Jesus Christ [Music] [Applause] [Music] if Man was created in the image and the likeness of God and man is male and female and he's created in the image and the likeness of God how is that God then that God is wow is that a problem so why you keep struggling you're going to swallow good food buddy he said so when God look down upon the body of Hope Christ he saw water both male and what a female he was all redeemed in that water he was a combo it was a package when that package went whoever was inside the package was also going to [Applause] if if the devil want to crucify you tell him you too late [Applause] when you are crucifying Jesus Christ you already done it [Applause] hahaha everybody okay everybody will care glory to God he said they are water one Sam and Sam water the same words off the water speaks of water the bride because the two are what one everybody okay everybody okay now if the woman is the glory of the man how did the woman came out of man because whatever happened to the first Adam must also happen to the water second Adam so let's see how did the woman came out of the first Adam number one they gotta make sure Adam is completely oh Jesus we okay the first Adam must be completely worthless and after sleeping God have to do what and after when they do excision what comes out is that a problem is that a problem do you want me to take you with me at the dental office and show you when I cut people will happen everybody okay and when they came out God was pulling who a woman so the woman in Adam came from his side everybody okay everybody okay so if Jesus Christ if Adam was male and female and to pull the Bride of Adam out of him they have to take the bread from the Sun You Follow Me Jesus who's the second Adam they must also put him to sleep and they must also peace him not in here he must be on the side and on the side they must fool somebody [Music] [Applause] Lord help me brother Branham say when Jesus suffered in the water body because man and a woman are what one person Eve was taken out of water Adam and the church what happened God not open up the water inside of Adam and took out the water the water the bride and God opened the side of who Jesus where at what Calvary and to cut his water right and when Jesus died remember the blood was not taken from the body until he was watered [Music] [Applause] he already did what died and they was going to break his water and the prophet said they shall not break they shall not one bond be broken so they had done John Back the Water Heaven the hammered to break the leg and the man went up with the waters and did water pushed it through to his water it's hard where is your heart here is where through his heart and what came out water and water why water and blood [Applause] why water in blood open first job glory to God I wish I have time to reach where I need to reach let's go to first John glory to God Hallelujah go to first John go to First John chapter 5. if you dare you can say Amen first John chapter 5 verse 6. amen amen you there verse six you there amen but Angelo you got amen let's go this is he amen let's go to verse 5 so it makes sense so I don't have question who is he that overcome the water the world but he that believed that Jesus is the water Son of God so we're talking about who Jesus The Who Son of God okay six this is he that came by water water and water blood if and who Jesus Christ so how was Jesus born by water and by what blood so Jesus Christ himself I'm going slowly Jesus Christ I hope you're getting what I'm saying amen the one who gave you birth himself because you cannot be born just like that you must first know how he was born and you must be born the same way because you and him you are so let's see how he was born the Bible said when Jesus was born Jesus was born with water and with water blood let's continue he said this is he that came by water water and water even who it is not by water only if it's just worth it we don't take it amen but by water and water and it is the spirit that beareth what witness because the spirit is water everybody okay everybody clear now for there are three that bear recorded water Heaven the Father the word and the Holy Ghost and this tree are what verse eight and there are three that bear witness in the water the waters and the water water and the water and these three are green water so Jesus Christ himself his birth was by water and water blood stop let's go to Calvary and see what come out of Jesus Christ go to the Book of John chapter 19. let's go to John chapter 19. glory to God if you dare you can say Amen John 19 verse 30. Hallelujah you there you there when Jesus therefore had to received the vinegar he said it is water finish and he bowed his head and gave up the water in other words Jesus was dead if you notice the bread is not out here yet nobody peace Jesus Christ before the peace Adam Adam must be completely and before the peace Jesus Christ he must be completely dead the tap never misses everybody okay so according to John 19 verse 30 the ghost of Jesus Christ already left his body and the body with her spirit James said he is dead verse 31 they choose therefore because he was the preparation that the body should not remain upon the cross on the Sabbath day for the Sabbath day was high and good in time it's just Where We Are so uchilat amen upon the cross on the Sabbath day for the Sabbath day was a high day besought palate that their leg might be watered and that they might be taken away then came the soldier and broke the leg of the first and the other and of the other which was crucified with him but you ready when they came to Jesus and so that he was already dead so somebody must Testify the death before the bride people because if they pulled the brand and Jesus is still alive something is wrong they must make sure that Jesus is completely dead they kick him they move around they do everything he's dead he pronounced dead the medical doctor said dead yeah man everybody okay and they saw that he was dead already they broke not his leg but one of the soldiers with the water speed peace is water Kama and forth with in other words immediately camera came there out what blood and water and water when Jesus Christ came he came with water blood and water water in other words the birth of Eve must be the same the birth of the blood of Jesus Christ must be exactly the way he he was born himself everybody okay according to the first Adam no Beauty one man and to pull his wife God put him to Deep Sleep cut his side move out and pull the glory of Adam and according to the second Adam one man in his body male and female and God have to put him to sleep no Beauty with him when they pull him inside they pull also somebody there with water and blood everybody clear and water and blood came forth he was already watered dead you saw it there she was already redeemed in other words if you look go back to verse 30. the Bible says when Jesus therefore had received the vinegar he says it is water in other words the bread cannot come out come on come on if the work of Jesus is not finished yet because she will miss something Christ have to make sure everything is finished then you are mature enough come out everybody okay but the product say that she was already hell redeem in the body of his water yeah so there is no more water suffering and water tribulation period for who the bride why there is no tribulation period for you why why you don't go to the tribulation period not because you're good enough you already went in the tribulation period the six seal the Judgment hit Jesus At The Cross and when the six seal was healed Jesus said the cross you also receive it [Applause] listen to Paul when you lay your hand by faith upon God accepted water provide a circle face a little bit High provided water sacrifice which was absolutely how perfect there is a body of Hope Christ and out of Adam Waters that made his Waters bright and out of the sad of who Christ came water blood and water water and water and water for his bride I am crucified with hope Christ nevertheless I Christ [Applause] foreign [Applause] this message is perfectly in line with the Bible here nevertheless I live yet it's not but it's true Christ and the life which are now live in this flesh I live by the faith of who the Son of God and gave himself for what for me glory to God glory to God glory to God look friend God was so careful don't let it leave you God never got a handful of dust and made an evil she had been a different what creation she's not a creation she was a water by flesh and God goes off in the water this water rather from under his what and take a whip to make a water a wife and the Very part of Adam water spirit was in the water the woman and day two are what one how so and what body and what Spirit they are what one stop they are perfect what Oneness brother Branham say body spirit and so they are what so in the body we just check it we find that the body was pierced something came out amen we need to find out the spirit everybody okay brother Branham continues he says he says they are one they are they are perfect Oneness a real woman a real husband a real wife they are one together what is a type of Christ from out of his water noted by product not a water Methodist or a water or a water Pentecostal no sir but out of his own heart she he took a water sweetheart that is pure and loyal as she can be she is a lawyer as a water look back there at Solomon speaking come my love let us walk in the pomegranate let us take a feel of love and when the real Believers are a Believer open his arm with a pure heart and he holds up to class that affection of that lover of Christ goes into his water it is his water just like a husband does to a real what why now we found out that the man is not beautiful the beauty of a man is hidden in his wife amen so the beauty of a man must be seen on the woman that's why in the human race the woman is the most beautiful that beauty reflects the beauty of a man everybody okay where are we going now by a person for the man is not of the water the woman but the woman of the water the man it was Adam that appears and pulled the wife over there they never Pierce Eve to pull out everybody okay Paul say neither was the Man created for the water the woman because the man was already there but he was the woman for the water because man was alone we clear on that for this course ought to the woman to have power on her head because of what the angels we already know that let's deal with the spirit put your seat belt very well and stay alert methodless everybody okay neither is the man without the what the woman needed the woman without the what the man in the water lord in the Lord in the Lord you cannot have a man without a female am I reading a different Bible and you cannot when you get in the Lord if you see a woman there must be a man and if you see a man there must be a movement in the Lord you can never have a female alone the female is always associated with the man and the man is always associated with the female because in the beginning God created them and God bless them and he called them Adam and both of them were in the Lord has in the Lord mean when you say in the Lord it means what open second Corinthians glory to God let's go to Second Corinthians chapter 3. what does in the Lord means we don't read the Bible just like that in the Lord in the body we found out that Jesus in his body he was male and what female now we need to go back to the spirit of Jesus to find what happened in the spirit of Jesus but Paul said in the Lord okay you cannot have a man without a female and you cannot have a female without a man but we need to know in the Lord means what let's go to Second Corinthians chapter 3 verse 17. if you dare you can say amen amen everybody okay everybody okay you there what Angel are you there yes sir all right let's go now the Lord is the water spirit stop so the Lord means the spirit and Paul is saying in the Lord in other words in the spirit of God you cannot find a male without a female or you cannot find a female without a man in other word the spirit of the Lord has a male and a female a letter soak it let me go straight again you cannot help a man without a female you cannot have a female without a man in the water because man when he was created he was male and female and he was created in the image and in the likeness of who so God is male and female and matador is the mayor and the female spirit in the deity in other words the Holy Ghost has a man and a female I let you swallow that keep swallowing keep swallowing I know where you're struggling I know I know where you're struggling I'll let you keep struggling a little bit for a few seconds because your problem is so we got a female Holy Ghost that's that that's what you have keep following you keep struggling first yeah you ready you ready you ready let's continue to read for the Lord is the water and where the spirit of the who the Lord is there is water so Paul is saying in the Lord there is nowhere without a woman and there is no female without a man in other words in the spirit of the Lord there is male and female and man at the beginning was created in the image and the likeness of who God if man is male and female god also is man and a female the tree of life was water you remember wisdom was water so what are you struggling when I say the Holy Ghost is male and female now you start running away [Music] when I say the tree of life is male and female you say Amen [Applause] you ready so according to Paul We Ready God also is water female to make it clear the Holy Ghost I'm preaching to this church anyway is water male female brother Stephen so we got a man holy ghost and we got a female Holy Ghost the Bible say bye one Spirit how can one Spirit be male and female one you awake you awake are you awake what does he mean male and female in the deity what does he mean are you ready Mel and female in God in the deity have nothing to do with sex and now you start to relaxing now whoever was like this is now your blood pressure is coming back to normal everybody okay when we say men and women when we say brother Angelo is a man sister geruchi is a female you know what you're thinking about you want to take that application to God that's where you struggling it doesn't go like that everybody okay Daddy's in the body it's male and female male and female male and female in the deity in God when you get in the spirit of God Amen the spirit of God is also one but that spirit is male and female the male and female have nothing to do with sex everybody okay what does he have to do then you okay the spirit of God is here everybody okay everybody okay this spirit of God is one but one doesn't mean one according to you because Adam was one man but Adam was because the truth shall be and if you have Adam with that if you don't have Adam if you have if without Adam you don't have Adam so for you to have Adam you must have Adam and Eve together for you to have brother John you must have the body of body jump the spirit of Brother John and the soul of Brother John then you have brother John if you only have the body of Brother John you only have portion of Brother John the three are makes sense so Oneness in the scripture is different than your whiteness we Okay we okay when you see me you see what I am my father are water why whose son the father who's in the father they only see Jesus Christ you see what I'm saying now when we say this is the Holy Ghost follow me carefully the Holy Ghost is one but that one is double because Man was created in the image and likeness of what that double means what everybody okay the female Holy Ghost you're following me what is it the female Holy Ghost is the portion of the Holy Spirit responsible to fill the bread of Jesus Christ yes if it's your hand thank you my brother follow me carefully Jesus said it is expedient for me to do what because if I go I will send you the water the comforter which is the on the day of Pentecost the Holy Ghost came down do you follow me the one who came down was the pillar of Fire and the pillar of fire was the fullness of the godhead are you following me when the pillar of fire came he found 120 people only you follow me the pillar of fire begin to divide himself one two three four five five all the way to 120. you're following me you're following me then the pillar of fire moving with 120 small pillars of fire follow me because follow me carefully and every leak of fire goes to one person and enter those persons do you follow me do you follow me the way will you think you will think that the pillar of fire is finished because you feel a hundred and twenty so do you have any more Pillar of Fire because when you look you see the pillar of fire from 120 he filled them so that's the pillar of fire exist anymore how can he exist that he was filling the people they're feeling that what was coming out of the pillar of fire he was a specific portion for a hundred and twenty people only do you follow me do you follow me that's why Paul when he was on the road to Damascus he saw the pillar of fire back again it doesn't mean that the pillar of fire that was in the disciple came off of them and made the pillar of fire again no no no no no no no the pillar of fire when you are you receive the holy God you are sealed until the day of what in other words your Holy Ghost will never come out of you do you follow me do you follow me if the Holy Ghost come here and stand here and he say I'm gonna give brother Benjamin and brother Angelo and brother uh uh uh Caleb and why they delayo the baptism of the Holy Ghost and sisters and the whole church because somebody said he didn't call me and the whole church the Holy Spirit when the pillar of fire come the pillar of fire will count do you follow me and he will look he said I need four boys here to receive the Holy Ghost and the pillar of fire will go on the portion of the Holy Ghost that belongs to the bride and see if your name is there [Applause] do you follow me if your name is there your name is associated with your quantity of the Holy Ghost can you follow me did I get you my brother then the Holy Ghost will say where is the Holy Ghost for Angelo they say the portion of Angelo is here the portion of Benjamin is here and the portion of Caleb is here the portion of Hadassah is here the Holy Ghost will not touch this portion this doesn't belong to Angela are you following me then he will dispatch Benjamin and four mix of fire will come out of him those leak of fire are not the league of fire of Jesus Christ [Applause] stop if I lost you raise your hand if I lost you raise your hand do you follow me the female part of God is the portion of the holy spirit that God have prepared for his blood because his pride must have the same spirit that he has so God took his spirit and divided into and said I take this portion and me I'm Jesus Christ these are the portion of the Holy Spirit I call it the bride and in that portion I have brother Joe I have brother Kalima I had Brothers saw and so everybody so and so but the two spirits that one [Applause] if I lost you raise your hand foreign do you follow me do you follow me you need to understand the new birth now do you understand me that's why the pillar of fire can come feel 120 and therefore and the pillar of fire is still there the pillar of fire that came here is the same Pillar of Fire that gave Paul the Holy Ghost he gave uh Peter the Holy Ghost he had he gave the disciple the Holy Ghost he gave brother Brown I'm the Holy Ghost but he's still appearing full hey baby that's why when Jesus give people break he cuts the bread he gives it to you but the bread keeps coming up that bread keeps coming up until you are full then he still remain with the bread but those bread came out from this bread if you take those bread you don't understand how this bread produced factors in bread how can a bread like this produce five thousand bread all those five thousand bread were in the bread but what was coming up was what was according to the people that were there when it failed it stopped he need to find somebody else [Applause] the male and the female spirit in the water this female part here called the blood of Jesus Christ have many names foreign or you want to stop here this portion called The Bride of Jesus Christ have many names this bride here is called The Church of God it is called the songs and Daughters of God that's why he has nothing to do with sex Amen in other words in this female part it doesn't mean you have women only this female have man and female these male and female are the Church of God they are also called the stars of God they are also called the Sheep of God they are also called the members of God they are also called gods they are also called the redeem they are also called the temple of God they are also called the household of faith they are also called the field of God they are also called The Fountain Of God by Solomon they are also called the guardian of God they are also called the Saints they are also called the Brethren of God [Applause] they are also called The Joint hair [Applause] they are also called the army of God they are also called the fellows of God [Music] they are also called the wife of God they are also called the bread of God [Applause] everybody okay so when they say God is male and female he doesn't have anything to do with sex that's why Paul says this let me skip this we already got it Paul says this he said for as many of you I have as has been what baptized into who Christ have put on who Christ there is need the water you know what three there is needed water but now what free there is neither water [Music] everybody okay in this bread this portion of the Holy Ghost is the female part of God it is the portion of the Holy Ghost responsible to feel the blood of Jesus Christ but here the remaining part of God of the Holy Ghost is the Holy Ghost of Jesus Christ himself that's why Jesus is not complete without you [Applause] everybody okay in the body of Jesus Christ he has male and female everybody okay at the CrossFit Calvary the female came out that's why Jesus said it is good it is experience that I go I already took you off from this side but I need to take your spirit the portion of the Holy Ghost that belongs to you I need to send them back on the day of Pentecost [Applause] brother brought them say oh that was in Christ he poured in water do you think he poor everything the way you think if he pour everything why did Paul see the pillar of fire deaths you think the poor in 110 people and there is nothing anymore nobody have the Holy Ghost again a Pentecostal understanding when Jesus Christ comes he's coming is Jesus going to have the Holy Ghost in him and you must have the Holy Ghost too so that your Holy Ghost and His holy ghost does what the Rapture when he's coming down you are doing water because it's a magnet the magnet is pulling an automatic and when the magnet is coming you also are going up it is the only God sucking the Holy Ghost until there are two holy ghosts then you have the fullness of God through it all in all in everything [Applause] where am I at my God whoa I gotta stop where am I ate my god listen to this Paul says in Christ there is need the word and water female there is neither male or female why because the male or female me and you male and female we are the Bride of Jesus Christ he have nothing to do with sex it is about who is the bride but that Brad contains songs and Daughters of God that's why in Christ we are there's neither mayor nor what in the body do we have male and female that's why Jesus says this if you feel we stop therefore in the water Resurrection whose wife shall she be of the seven foreign they came they asked Jesus Christ there was a woman got married my husband died she took the second one husband now seven they say well in the resurrection that woman will belong to who Jesus is answered he said Jesus answer and say unto them ye do water not knowing the water not the water the power for in the water Resurrection they need the water nor are giving in water but they are as Water Angels of God God in heaven your sexy should stop here not over there [Music] that was your problem when I was saying female god female Holy Ghost you were thinking about the Holy Ghost as a woman okay Jesus answering say unto them the children of this world marry and are giving into water that's what we do here the altar but then which shall be okay worthy to obtain water the world we have nothing to do with sex did I lost you Paul says for ye are all water one in who Jesus and if you be Christ then your water and Hell according to the water for by Waters one spirit we are all about that in how many body one body takes one spirit that Spirit doesn't look at you as woman and man he looks at the predestinated seed as long as you have a representation of God he will look he say there is a daughter of God God sister Divine he picks sister Divine and give the Holy Ghost there is a Son of God called brother child turned he picked the Holy Ghost and give it to him in Christ brother Charles and sister Divine both of them are Brad they are both the wife of Jesus Christ in Christ both of them are female even though naturally chose is a man but in Christ he is the wife of Jesus [Applause] by one Spirit while we are water into water where there will be water or water whether we be water a water we've been all made to drink into how many spirits one spirit what amen if the same spirit that Rose Christ from the dead dwelling so if he dwell in you did he leave Jesus Christ empty everybody okay everybody okay for we being many you see many we are how many bread now we become a bread did you know that that's your scripture we are also the bread of God because he himself say I am the bread of life if he is the bread what are we [Applause] if I can get where I'm trying to he says that for we are all partaking of that water one bread we become the bread because we get into Christ who is the bread he is the bread we are the bread and we become one that's why he can take the bread and cut the bread and there is bread he cut the bread and there is because that bread is one the bread that has been cut and given to the people that bread is called the female bread everybody okay everybody okay he says and yeah water and crust is water God let me Land This Plane here amen follow me carefully who you struggling God in the beginning put your seatbelt when he knowed man and what woman was made what one not two they were made what one they were separated one put in water flesh and one in the water so in order to prove that to you when God made the woman he never took some dust and made hair like he did the man he took a water out of the side of Adam and she became a brother my brother of a man because she is whatever part of him you get it now there you are follow me carefully the patriarch they are the Angels you ready God is a what according to first John 4 24. God he said What Spirit God and the spirit that is John with let's read slowly God and their spirit that is John with what God is what one spirit let me go back here watch here brother Angelo let's go read that quote again there God God and the that is John with God are what one spirit can I continue again let's read it again God and the spirit that is joy join us [Applause] this message is deeper than you think in other words God demand Jesus Christ and the spirit the Holy Ghost of Jesus Christ and the Holy Ghost that is making the bread both holy ghosts are one Holy Ghost the holy ghost that was in Jesus Christ and the holy ghost that you receive in your baptism both Holy Ghost are God and the spirit that is joined the wife with God is what one spirit that is right now the spirit of God that dwell in their church is the spirit that comes from where Heaven that God knew where before foreign do you understand do you understand do you understand God who is in heaven and the spirit of God that is in the church the Holy Ghost on the male version and the female Holy Ghost which is the version of the Holy Ghost in the church both of those Holy Ghost is just one Holy Ghost but this is the key I'm trying to stop here brother Branham say that God they now the spirit of God that dwell in the Water Church the female okay is the spirit that comes from what heaven that God knew before the water remember that wisdom when God created that wisdom was with her you remember and then that spirit that uh before the foundation of the world that rejected the water and that Spirit had to take a water to take his water he had to come flesh like this other did and all of them put in water in other words your Holy Ghost that is resisting the devil today already was with God before the foundation of the world in other words you're standing this message that's not surpass God you already stood for the message long time ago [Applause] the one who stood for the message was not you he was your Holy Ghost [Applause] your portion of the Holy Ghost is what resisted the devil that's why when you are filled with the Holy Ghost there is nothing the devil will do because before the foundation of the world you fought the devil you overcome the devil you resisted the devil all you need is God to God and say give me my portion give me my Holy Ghost [Applause] I wish I have time [Music] I don't know turn it in I'm trying to get somewhere go to Ephesian one please Lord help me this is not a Pentecost of food buddy that's why Paul say it's a great mystery and the devil doesn't want you to understand that they therefore want you to understand that you and God are different you are just a small creature that God created that's not the whole case I wish I can go I wish I can preach what is coming up it will make you jump out of this chair let's go to Ephesian one Lord help me I have to stop are you there let's skip the first one go to verse 3 blessed be the word God and the father of who our Lord Jesus Christ how is that Lord our why is it our where is the hour who is our who is our I wish I can go with you one one one one like I promise amen who is the father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has done what bless us remember Adam when he was created both male and female that's why God blessed him so the second Adam our blessing we don't receive it now [Applause] you

Jesus Christ who has done water bless us with water how many spiritual blessings oh how many oh spiritual blessing in water Heaven places in water Christ so we are spiritual blessing our way in Christ in Christ there is no male and female so if you can only get in class if you can only open the door and get in Christ you will find your pre-programmed blessing are just waiting for you you are the one outside of Christ and the blessing are calling you come over here we are here we are here we are the day you will live and enter in Christ then we say finally you have come before you know it your life is changing your wife is changing your children are changing your business is changing your home is changing your job is changing your health is changing everything begins to change because your blessing are in Christ Oh Glory to God [Music] verse 4. where are we blessed in Christ verse 4 according as he has what chosen Us in water him come over here brother Angelo read as he has water chosen us where before the foundation of the world as he has chosen as well where him look at the Bible eat water [Music] [Applause] if in the flesh was not her existence she was already existing Adam already existed what you saw in the flesh it is just a manifestation of something that already existed you didn't begin today what you call birthday is not your birth [Music] that is the time you became flesh of Flesh and born of born that is what you call birthday but you never had the beginning you never had a man you was eternally existed [Applause] oh if the church can get this but one day you will get let's go to verse 4. according thus he has chosen Us in what before the water that we should be how holy and without water stop ready go to Ephesians 5. they want you to be how and what let's go to Ephesians 5. let's go to verse 25 but Angelo let's go push the last push that you can let this baby be born let's go that he might present water Ephesians 5 27 you there let's go that Hema presented to water himself a water glorious church because the woman is the glory of the husband not having water or water or any such thing but that it should be how holy and we dropped water in other words what God requires for you to be was already predestinated foreign [Applause] [Music] God is not asking you something that you don't qualify you already qualified for it he just wants you to accept it to step into it to embrace it and to become what belongs to you oh Church of the Living God let me stop here let's stand let me stop here what I have here is a lot of people [Music] why are people leaving the message you don't leave the message you think because you make sense to you when you stood for this message did you understand what you have been understanding today so what makes you stand in a message did you understand the seal when we left that church where you understanding this here did you understand the Thunder why did you stood for the message if you understand that you resisted the devil eye before the foundation of the in other words the devil knows you [Music] the day you will recognize who you are the devil will recognize that that person is not different what are you investing in your life what are you investing in your life what are you giving preeminence what are you giving preeminence you put your job in front of God that's why you keep pushing that's why you are struggling you are looking for overtime you work too much a Son of God is not supposed to be like that a Son of God is not supposed to be like that amen I hope you understand what it is so when you ask God for the Holy Ghost don't be coming like you are asking something that that you don't even know what you're talking about change your prayer tell God you know me I wish I can there are stuff Beyond this that will turn you upside down tell God you know me me and you we existed before what I'm asking is not something new it's something that belongs to me I am held to that if you go look he says my name on it that's what I'm asking give me my mountain [Applause] young people the Holy Ghost you need the Holy Ghost Lord when are you going to fill me with that no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no it's God who's watching you claiming you to present you to himself a church with that spot with that the Flemish that will be holy and without blemish why because in him before the foundation of the world he already predestinated you to be holy without blemish that's why he's just implementing his plan in you all you have to do is just surrender [Applause] you're begging for something that belongs to you talk to God honestly you say father help me now I understand that you have predestined me to have the Holy Ghost so the Holy Ghost is not something that is just there that I'm guessing whether I'm going to receive or not it is something that belongs to me there is a portion of you called The Bride part of that brother so they gotta be a portion of the holy spirit that belongs to me to make me and me a new one give me that portion that's all I need that is my representation that is your name that is your personal revelation of Jesus Christ to you not to somebody else that's why people receive the Holy Ghost different way somebody might fell on the ground somebody begin to dance somebody because it depends if your Holy Ghost has a program to dance when he will come you find yourself dancing like this and you are filled with the Holy Spirit foreign [Applause] [Applause] for me to stop we will continue again let's pray Heavenly
