praise him like you believe he's here praise him like you believe he's here amen amen blessed be the name of the Lord you might be seated for a few minutes a lot of folks out for hoid dayss some sick but the Lord is still a Healer amen just to remind you this coming week our meid service will not be on Wednesday we will have a service here at the hotel on Thursday that our new year Eve service and it start at 7:30 and Lord's willing brother Tim Hatton will be with us here and we will also have the Lord supper we will have our communion and our foot washing we already prepare everything so make sure you get it because since we started we have not have any opportunity to get it everybody clear so far so Lord's willing we must send a text throughout the week just to remind you that our service is not here on Wednesday but it's on Thursday thday the 31st amen so we can pray spend some time worshiping the Lord thank him for everything for his grace his Mercy through this pandemic he have been with us amen I'm going to call two special people we have this morning by God's grace but before I do that let's go to Matthew chapter 1 need to have your Bible just a few minute and this is not our normal reading but I just want to make a point on what we're going to do here the Bible says in verse 18 if you dare you can say Amen the Bible says that now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise when as his mother pages are still turning just waiting everybody there everybody there okay Verse 18 now the birth of Jesus Christ was on this wise Verse 18 Matthew 1 verse 18 when as his mother Mary was engaged if you notice here the word used is engaged amen amen when they say engaged that means that they are not married yet but they to be married amen Mary was engaged to Joseph before they came together you might be seated so there is an engagement first before they come together as husband and wife so we don't want to flip that around Mary was engaged to Joseph before they came together in other words before they get married first you get engaged then you get married she was found with a child of the Holy Ghost in other word she got pregnant before they got married amen verse 19 then Joseph her husband being a just man and not willing to make her a public example a just man will not be running his MTH out against his wife did you hear that amen did you hear that a Christian just man should not be on the internet Facebook on Twitter on WhatsApp on the telephone gossiping about his wife you don't say amen that's fine your ears are saying amen amen I know some are not here so we we going to work our way out then Joseph her husband if you notice Joseph is called a husband but they are not married yet so even though he's called married there is still even though he's called husband there is still limitation to certain things Hallelujah being a just man and not willing to make her a public example was minded to put her away prly verse 20 but while he thought on these things behold the angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream saying Joseph you son of David fear not to take to you Mary your wife so even in Heaven by being engaged already God is recognizing that it's a husband and wife but to be married not a husband and wife to have children that's the reason why Joseph was trying to get mared out separated privately amen so what I'm trying to make a point here when you are engaged you are not permitted on the physical you are only engaged to be married amen there was only one virgin birth so I don't expect the Virgin birth in this church Amen in other word I don't expect any woman here who's not married to get pregnant you get engaged first you get married then we're waiting for the baby amen blessed be the name of the Lord saying Joseph you son of David fear not to take your wife Mary your wife for that which is conceived in hell is of the Holy Ghost there is only one promise it only happened one time and that's what we are believing and for everybody else there is a process you get to talk to the lady you get engaged once you get engaged Lord's willing he open the way we Bless The Wedding then praise the lord we ready for baby shower everybody clear praise the name of the Lord so this morning I'm going to call Brother Joshua N he's here with with us this morning brother Josh you can come up here many of you don't know him but we're going to explain you if you can turn around and look at the congregation they we have a big part of a congregation on uh streaming now some travel some home Co and all kind of stuff so they can see you pretty good and I'm call I'm going to call sister Tia isar sister Tia you here many of you know sister Tia which is brother Mickey's first daughter sister T is here you can be standing there beside the brother yeah just beside right there praise the name of the Lord so Brother Joseph brother Joshua and sister Tia are engaged amen praise the name of the Lord officially engaged so if there was a young man that have been watching sister teer this is too late amen it is already too late she is engaged in the eyes of God it's husband and wife to be married everybody clear so we also want to ask the family who came to support the engagement everybody that came in if you can stand and the church will see you and we can just welcome you this morning let's give the Lord a hand this morning brother Joshua father and mother are back there brother Arthur and his wife so we welcome them this morning and the entire family can't call Everybody by his name by we thank God for everything so brother God bless you continue with prayer and Lord willing if the Lord carries we're going to get you married congratulation and thank you very much you might be said it again amen it is a good and beautiful thing to be married especially when I see a man and a woman it really thrill my soul yeah we thank the musician this morning if you didn't get my message in here we only marry men and women that's the Bible Way and that's what he going to stay so congratulation young man amen now let's stand and go to our scripture this morning in the Song of Solomon Hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord time run faster I remember Sister t a little bit of years ago now they grown up they're getting married that's a wonderful thing praise the name of the Lord Song of Solomon Chapter 5 we preached on this before so in this church you should be familiar with this story but I'm just going to draw one point into it chapter 5 verse1 if you thereare you can say amen I am come in my garden you already know what a garden means it's a woman my sister that's the garden my spouse we already explained to you sister spouse you got to be married to a sister before she becomes your wife in other words she need to be Christian amen I have gathered my mirr with my spice I have eaten my Honey C with my honey you might be seated I have drunk my wine with my milk there is a milk here which is for the baby and there is a wine which is uh speaking of the Holy Spirit and the stimulation of the Revelation I have drunk my wine with my milk eat if you notice there he's now calling to friends he says eat oh friends drink yeah drink abundantly or beloved we know clearly by this scripture that it was Solomon going to the shat but we found out that as he's going to the shat he's not alone now here they are calling for friends so in this occasion in this big reception or whatever have to take place here it is not only the king and the queen but there is somebody there called into this occasion but those person are the friends amen we know Jesus called Judah his friends let's go to John chapter 6 John chapter 6 verse 70 we have King Solomon and and the sh but as they come together there is a presence of a friends amen there is a king there is an Esther because we are dealing with Esther but when Esther is inviting the king there must be him and there you got it clear praise the name of the Lord John chapter 6 verse 7 if you dare you can say Amen Jesus answered them have not I chosen you 12 so the one who chose the disciple is Jesus Christ himself amen so usually we think when Jesus pick everything he's going to pick the perfect one but for some reason he chose 12 but one of them was not from him yet he was called to work in the ministry of Christ he say have I not chosen you 12 and one of you is what it is Christ that pick Judah it is Jesus Christ that pick the devil into his ministry amen you might be wondering why did Esther call the king but she's also calling hon which is a top of the devil amen but before the great victory can happen to the human to humanity God have to call the devil into that Ministry amen you cannot fulfill a great Victory without the devil being present he say and one of you is a devil verse 71 he spoke of Judah is carot the son of Simon for he he was that should betray him being one of the 12 amen let's go to Romans chapter 7 now and we're going to pray if you dare you can say Amen Roman 12 chapter 15 Hallelujah blessed be the name of the Lord verse 15 chapter 8 7 verse1 15 for thou which are do I allow not for what I would that I do that do I not but what I hate that do I in other word what I want to do I cannot do it and what I don't want to do that's what I found myself doing remember this is Apostle Paul that is talking Paul here is already being baptized and fill with the baptism of the Holy Spirit we saw it last Sunday this is not a sinner talking this is a Christian being filled with the holy spirit that is telling you that I found out that when I want to do something I cannot do it and what I don't want to do I found myself doing it amen in other words there is a war that I found within myself everybody clear and if verse 16 if then I do that which I would not I consent in other word I agree to the law that it is good we already explained you the law verse 17 now then it is no more I that do it but sin that dwells in me in other word Paul is an entity he's a man but Paul is telling you that Within me we are two people there is one person that is called the inward man we're going to see it right now and there is another that is called the other man or the man of the outside the other man is the physical man that's your body which we call the body amen the inward is the spiritual man amen which brother Bram referred to that as the Inside Man sometime and Paul says that I am already filled with the Holy Spirit I am a Christian I am trying everything that I can to believe and to please the Lord but I find myself that whenever I want to do that which is good I cannot do it but what I don't want to do that's what I'm doing and Paul says that I found that it is not me it is not the inward man it is not this man that is filled with the holy spirit amen it is not this man of the inside it is the outside man that is doing that and the outside man which is the body within that body Paul say there is still sin am everybody clear so whenever you are walking you have an enemy with you make sense when you sleep you are sleeping with your enemy when you wake up you are waking up with your enemy when you coming to church you are bringing your enemy he's not outside like you think he's right within you amen Verse 18 for I know that in me this is Paul that is in my the body everybody clear and all that in me that is in the flesh in my body does no good thing nothing good in a body I thought when you receive the Holy Spirit everything is done amen for to will is present with me I have that will but how to perform that which is good I found not in other word there is a hindrance amen verse 19 for the good that I would I do not but the evil which I would not that I do now if I do that I would not it is no more I that do it everybody clear but who s sin that dwells where so Paul is telling you that it is not me that is doing that it is this body that is doing that but on the inside man I'm trying to preach the Lord everybody clear verse 21 and I found then a law that when I will do good evil is present with me for I Delight in the law of God after the what the inward men after the inside men I love the Lord I love his law everybody clear but I see another law in my members in the body Waring against me that law is not there to pet you that that law is not there to condone with you that law is not there to help you to leave a Christian Life that law is there to war against you so you cannot live a Christian life amen if you don't know what I'm talking about when you woke up this morning that Lord was telling you you can stay home that was telling you you are too sleepy that tell you they are streaming the service you don't have to get in your car you can stay at home and you can stream the service I'm not saying those that are streaming are under that law I'm just making a point amen because they have a legitimate reason for staying there but that's the LA that make you ly that's the LA that don't want you to pray that's the LA that want you to get closer to God and that law is not there for peace it is that is in your body for verse 23 but I see another law in my M war against the law of my mind the spirit and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my member in other word within me said that I have two dos that's right are you following me you need to read your message I have a black dog come on every and I have a white do that the mystery of the Indian CH when he got converted said Chief how are you doing and the chief said uhuh since I got converted I'm in trouble he said what's going on the chief said that within me I got two dog and those dog have constantly all the time they are fighting one with another amen but this message doesn't only describe you but the message also give you the solution to how to overcome and brother brandham say so how do you overcome he say it depend on the one I'm feeding the one I'm feeding the most that's the one that is taking over amen whether I'm spending my time in prayer in meditation in fasting or I'm spending my time on Facebook on Twitter on internet wasting my time and trying to please friends amen let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we thank you again for your grace your love your mercy and for everything you're doing for us father thank you for giving us another opportunity to be together in this house around the reveal word of of the hour Lord father may you be the Alpha and the Omega of this service Lord may you help me surrender may you move me completely out of the way Lord may you speak to your children this morning Father some are sick battling in their body some Lord father are trying to recover Lord some have traveled because of the holy days and they need your travel Mercy Lord to protect them we know Lord father some have family member that are sick Lord that need Lord father you touch Lord we pray in the name of Jesus Christ that you touch them Lord may you remove every spirit of destruction every Spirit of laziness every spirit that might try to hinder the service or bring a sleepness lord father upon your children may our mind be focused around your word Lord and may you speak and touch our soul and bless us today Lord father we seal Out the Devil completely out of this place Lord and we ask that the anointing of the Holy Spirit minister to each one according to their need Lord father we humbly ask it in the name of Jesus Christ amen God bless you this morning we are continuing on our series The King aass three feast and Esther two banquet we found out and we explain to you that the Book of Esther have Seven Feast the first three feasts were the feast that were made by King aerus himself on the first Feast we explain to you that he was the Jewish dispensation when God was dealing with the Jews then there follow another Feast of seven days which we unfold by the message of the hour that is it was a feast of the seven Church ages where God is not dealing with the Jews anymore but God was dealing with the Gentile then on the third Feast explained to you that it was the Feast of the marriage supper because it was called Esther's Feast that the king made for the honor of Queen Esther but we found out that in between the three Feast of king aerus and the two banquet that was prepared by Ester that there was a feast that was hidden there and through the help of brother Branham we came to decode that Feast that it was the three days fasting of Esther which we spoke last Sunday and and brother Bram explained to us that a feast fasting a body it is a feast with the Lord so after that then Esther begin to uh prepare her first banquet then the second banquet then the last Feast is going to be the Feast of purum which makes all together Seven Feast because seven is God's number to reveal himself in his mathematics everybody clear now last Sunday when we looked at the seven churches according to Revelation 14 we saw that there were three special angels that were mentioned we know that the seven Church ages is a is a dispensation of the Gentile that goes with seven messenger from Paul all the way to brother Branham but in Revelation 7 uh 14 there was a section that was taken particularly to explain three special Angel and brother Bram explained to us that those Angel were Luther and the second one was Wesley and the third one was himself William Maran Branham and what made those angels special was because the three Ministry were speaking about the three steps of Grace Luther preached justification Wesley preached sanctification and in the age of laisha we are dealing with the age of the baptism of the holy spirit amen and those step affect the individual affect the church and also affected the Earth because the Earth went through justification through the waters of Noah and he went through just uh to sanctification brother Bram say when Christ was on the cross his blood sh was shed and the blood touched the Earth and sanctify the Earth but Peter also explained to us that the Earth will be burned so we will still have justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Spirit everybody clear so now when we get back to the Book of Esther that we have been studying the second Feast of King aerus was a 7day feast of wine but we found out that in between those feasts and the banquet of Esther there was another Feast that was placed there which is the three days of fasting of Queen Esther before she goes into the presence of the king because Esther described to us that there was 30 days that was there that she was never she never saw the king and we explain to you that 30 have three numbers three which is a number of perfection giving us the three step and then zero which is eternity which is speaking of number8 because both eight and zero are the same everybody clear so far now when we read brother Bram here just to kind of underline it again brother Bram say in the message Paradox that I was planning on taking a fast to the Lord I told him that I would go out and fast amen when I come when you come to this Feast which is a fast which a fast in the body is a feast with the Lord if you notice brother Bram is talking about the fast in the body because usually when when we are fasting the thing that is affected in our life is our body amen so when we are fasting we are actually inflicting our body we are actually treating our body a little bit harder because the body want to eat the body want to drink the body want to sleep but when you fast you are telling the body you're not going to drink today you're not going to eat today you're not going to do anything today but being in the presence of the Lord and even the Lord Jesus Christ we found out that when we fasted the Bible says that he got hungry and he also got weak everybody clear praise the name of the Lord so a feast a fast in the body is a feast with the Lord everybody clear yourself far am now brother Bram says that in a message T that I think David in the writing of the psalm if you read the message thirst you will know the psalm he's referring to m they have been in distress and when we read in the Book of Esther we found out that what brought actually the fasting in the life of Esther was trouble it took distress to bring Esther into fasting Esther was in the king's Palace she never fasted before Esther was sitting everything was handed to her she was living a good life she was living a luxurious life she was living a comfortable life until the news came and they told her that you are in trouble and it took trouble to drive Esther into a life of a consecration everybody clear your so far brother Bram say must have been in distress and it usually takes what you need to wake up it's usually taking what distress to bring the best out of a man it trouble in your life to bring the best out of you we don't want to trouble we don't want to go to trial we don't want to go through difficulty but there is no way out for God to bring himself out but to push you into a corner everybody clear brother Bram continue he says that get down to when we fast many times brother bham is explaining fasting now he says many times I'm going to go back here he say it really that is when God gets down to when we fast we're talking about a fast which is a feast in the body butam say many time he's explaining a fast to get ourself in a position to get ourself out of the way so brother Bram is explaining here that a fast is a is a mean that God have prepared to make you get out of position amen get out of your way and begin to depend completely on the Lord amen a fast get you in the position of dependency a fast get you in the position when you have to surrender everything a fast put you in the position when you have to seek for a power that is is higher than your power a fast put you in a position of perfect weakness and when you are weak then God is strong everybody clear if you notice when Jesus begin to fast the devil never came to him but after fasting the Bible says that he got hungry and Jesus was weak and the devil thought that when he's weak that is the time to get him but he didn't understand that fasting was a position of yielding was a position when you put your call in new was a position when you stop working for your life and you begin to depend on God to lead you and to guide you and to take over your life and when Satan tried to attack the Lord Jesus Christ he found out that he got the wrong number amen one day the disciple were going with Jesus into the boat and Jesus was sleeping and the wind rose up instead of the disciple going and relying to Jesus Christ and call Christ to come and solve the issue they were doing their own work amen they tried to lighten the boat it didn't work they tried to go here and there it didn't work and that's what God does in our life sometime when you think you are too smart when when you think you have your life in control when you think you can do what you want to do you are mature daddy cannot say anything mommy cannot say anything I am mature I am 18 years old I can pay my own apointment that's when God put you in trouble amen you going to try this the credit card is declin your it is declin everything you thought is declin they fire you in your job you can cannot pay your electricity you cannot pay your car they repossess your car it is God doing all of that until you surrender your life and you learn that your life depend on God blessed be the name of the Lord Brother bam continue he say I think when David got in this places then he begin to do what meditate bring you closer to God that's one of the key of the third po we explain to you on the Lord begin to think about these things many time God get us in a tight Corners where we have to look up so the purpose of the tight corner is not to lose you the purpose of the tight corner it is not for you to look down it is not for you to be distress it is not for you to be sad but it's for you to look up in other words for you to recognize that I need God in my life Hallelujah sometime we even have to get on our back in a hospital God does it yes sir or a bed somewhere so we can look up to see where the great blessings of God come from Esther comfortable everything handed to her she got menen she got people working for here then the Lord the king took the seal and gave it to him and like go ahead and do something so let's see how comfortable she's up there everybody clear in return and Jubilee brother Bram say we need to go back to a power of God Amen something that can do the same thing today how do we go back persecution always give strength to the church I thought we want things easy amen persecution always give strength to the church we had it too easy like Esther that's why mod told her if you think because you are over there you going to escape don't think you going to escape because they told her go to the king she said I cannot go to the king because it's not you know there is a protocol you got to do this and do this and do this and morei understood that I know what you're talking about you are comfortable there everything is easy for you everything is handed to you but just know one thing you're not going to escape this one amen persecution always give you give strength to the church we had it too easy we get it slowful we get to a place where we don't want to move on like Esther because everything is just handed to us just like Esther in the Palaces it takes what oh my God it takes it takes it takes it takes it takes to move forward in the power of the holy spirit amen we want to go back to the normal life amen everybody want to get a vaccine because once we get a vaccine we go back to doing everything the way we were doing before but we miss to understand that God permitted the pandemic for you to look [Applause] [Music] up amen we found our way to play with the pandemic amen a first it's a feast in the body when we are dealing with the body here I want to make mention that there is two sort of body that we dealing with we are dealing with the body as the Church of God Amen because the Church of God is the temple of God it is the body of the Lord it is also called The Bride of Jesus Christ and when we speak also about the body the body also spoke about you as an individual because you also you are a temple of God Amen brother Bram says this in the message BL Blasphemous name he says now that then from this and then bringing this into the seven Church ages God is building in seven Church ages a brad for Christ these are the seven Church ages drop down here they awoke the virgin of Ephesus smina pergamus tatara Sardis Philadelphia and laoda did you notice that through the years ages he has built a bride born bride be begotten a bride on Earth for Christ and this is the key point and the same way that he begets the bride he has begot what the same way God is dealing with a church that's the same way he's dealing with you as an individual everybody clear so far brother brandham continues here he says and now as in the individual these virtues and things are knowledge and temporal is added to our faith then when we come then when the Capstone comes the Holy Spirit cements it together there is the baptism of the Holy Ghost and then God through that has brought also seven Church ages to show the seven step that he brought building his what individual into his so when we will be talking here we will be talking back and forth about the church as the Bride of Jesus Christ and the church also as individual we are not building an organization I'm not here this morning to build an organization Christ never sent me to build organization Christ sent me to build what to the Statue of who that they might be the PowerHouse and the dwelling place of the a temple by his word by his to see build up the individual to the place not buildt an organization to a greater denomination but built the individual to Sons and Daughters of that is the dear everybody clear take galatian chapter 5 we are still climbing praise the name of the Lord if you dare you can say Amen just as a reminder Paul taught us that there is a law there is a law of sin that is working in the body there is an enemy in your body that is sin that enemy doesn't want to serve God he's not there for peace he's there forward but there is the inside man that is Born Again by the baptism of the Holy Spirit that is the man that want to serve God not your body amen Galatians chapter 5 verse 16 if you dare you can say amen amen this has say then walk in the what everybody there walk in the spirit and you shall not fulfill the last of the everybody clear now Paul is saying that as a Christian fill with the Holy Spirit you have the world in your body there is sin you have your enemy right beside you you sleep with him you wake up with him you take a shower with him you go everywhere with your enemy everybody clear but Paul is advising you he say walk in the spirit walk according to a Inside Man if you pay attention to the Holy Ghost you automatically are feeding the wife white dog and you will not be under the law of sin and death everybody clear so walk in the spirit and you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh brother Steven I'm struggling I don't know how to live a Christian Life there is two ways to it either you don't have the baptism of the Holy Spirit you are not born again yet so you need to seek for the Holy Ghost you need to repent you need to be justified Sanctified baptized and baptized with the Holy Spirit baptized with water and baptized with the Holy Spirit that's the first step but if you are already being baptized and you believe that in your life you have the spirit of God for you to uh overcome this enemy Paul is telling you pay attention to the Holy Ghost amen once you pay attention to the Holy Ghost once you give yourself more to the things of God at that point automatically you will not fulfill the desire of the flesh a woman when she's married she have to attend to her husband by the baptism of the Holy Ghost you are married to Christ pay attention to crush your husband if you do that you shall not fulfill the lust of the flesh so if you are you have the Holy Ghost and you are still struggling in the flesh it's because you don't pay attention to your husband instead of listening to your husband instead of spending time with your husband you are spending time on Facebook with your friend no problem verse 17 for the flesh last against what remember it's a war everybody clear for the flesh last against the spirit and the spirit against the War everybody clear and these are what they are contrary in other words they are inos they are contrary the one to the other so that you cannot do the F that you that's why Paul in Romans 7 say what I want to do I don't do it what I don't want to do that's what I'm doing and Paul says that I found out there is war Within Me amen now in galatian Paul continues again that there is war there is an inside man the spirit and there is an outside man if you don't pay attention you're going to be worrying all the time and can't get nowhere as long as you fighting one another you can't go nowhere I'm not talking about one another with your neighbor with yourself amen Verse 18 but if you be led on of what Spirit you are not under the be led of the spirit and automatically by default this dog is weak everybody clear so far let's go to Romans chapter 8 we read Romans 7 let's go to 8 we drawing a point then we go back to Esther Romans chapter 8 if if you dare you can say Amen praise the name of the Lord Roman 8 ver 6 are you there for to be connly fleshly body to be carnally minded is what right there in your body remember hon the pel horse death everybody clear to be corally minded is death but to be spiritually manded is what that's why Paul say pay attention to the spirit to be spiritually manded is life and what if you want to be in peace pay attention to the Holy Ghost quit playing around verse seven because the cor of man mind is what is imity against who so your body is an enemy to God leave that friend that don't like you alone leave that friend that is gossiping about you alone leave that neighbor that don't like you alone deal with yourself leave the sister alone leave that brother alone deal with yourself it is a time to stop watching what is in Tennessee what is in Texas what is in Philadelphia what happened to the churches in Europe what happened to the churches in Africa all the time message believer become like CNN they know what happen in every churches looking at the other churches they are local churches worry about your own church did you he over there brother so and so did this did you he in Canada brother so and so did this did you he in Africa did you he in Florida leave Florida alone hallelujah praise the name of the Lord because the corner mind verse 7 is imity against God for it is not subject to the law of what don't try to make your body Christian amen neither indeed can be you won't be able to do that I'm going to draw a point so then they that are in the flesh cannot do what so watch what you doing in your life if it's carnal you're not pleasing God automatically because you are feeding the the the black dog everybody clear verse n but you are not in the flesh but in the spirit if so be that the spirit of God dwell in you in other words if you have the Holy Spirit just remember you live by the Holy Ghost in case you have the Holy Ghost if you don't don't have it you better find it because if you don't have the Holy Spirit automatically by default you're going to be overcome you can try and try you're going to fail you try you try you're going to fail you try you try you're going to fail you need a higher power everybody clear praise the name of the Lord now if any man have not the spirit of Christ he is none of his and if Christ be in you the body is what because of what your enemy everybody there but the spirit is life because of what jum to verse 23 everybody there and not only they talking about nature but ourself also which have the first fruit of the spirit we have the baptism of the Holy Ghost even we ourself grown what inside ourself waiting for the the adoption to do what that is the Redemption of our so now Paul is explaining to us clearly that the Inside Man is already redeemed when you have the baptism of the Holy Spirit the work of God on your inside is finished that's why you are seal until the day of your Redemption finish eternally still but your body is not finished yet amen everybody there you are waiting for the spirit to reap the adoption once you are adopted we already talk about adoption then this adoption will bring this body to be changed and to be like him everybody clear so the work of Calvary never finish Redemption Calvary started Redemption and the work of Calvary is opening the way for the Holy Spirit to enter into you but you need sunset [Music] Mountain to bring the Rapture to bring you into a second Ministry that is going to deal with this amalekite everybody clear brother Bram the flesh thirst to satisfy the desire that is in the body and the spirit desires for the things that is in the soul you see the two now desire is and many times this were War one against the you got everything in the scripture now we going through the through the message we find there what is a great trouble today that too many people try to live between those two as long as you don't understand what I'm telling you you're going to be confused you're going to be mad about yourself you're going to call yourself stupid have you seen people calling themselves stupid you do something and you say I'm stupid I'm stupid I'm stupid because you don't understand what is going on Amen you are not stupid it is sin that is stupid amen for one of them desire the things of the Earth the body the other desire the things of what like Paul says describe in Romans 7:21 when I will do good then evil is n present when you try did you ever have that in experience Christians he's talking to Christians everybody clear okay that when you are trying to do something that is worthwhile go to make an effort to do something that is good then you find out that there is the devil on every hand just to upset you everything that is one good thing that everybody clear you want to do something good and the devil is still blocking you want to go see a sister and someone is telling you no she doesn't shake your hand why are you going to go sit there amen it is not you everybody clear that is not you that is the devil in your flesh everybody clear that is one good thing I like to say this that the Christian might know when you are starting to do something and there is something always trying to upset you in doing it do it anyhow don't shake that sister hand go shake a hand don't talk to the brother that is the time you need to talk to the brother don't invite them that is the time to invite them Hallelujah do it anyhow that is the that is the devil there trying to keep you from doing what is what so every time you want to do something that is good just know you have an enemy there working with you because in the body there is a law everybody clear brother Bram say we are both natural and supernal this body is subject to death and was brought forth by a woman not by nothing but through not by God you are a r production from Adam and Eve be black white or whatever you are you are a production and off swing from Adam and Eve that makes your body born in what shape in iniquity coming to the word speaking what by default you already in trouble that's why you must be born again everybody clear you are damn and condemned at the beginning of your life as a baby already condemned not even without a chance now because the spirit that you have come to you by nature and by Nature coming from a sexual intercourse desire man and woman produce an Earthly CH that's the man that we are talking about the amalik I have often said the greatest enemy I who is I brother BR okay we thought brother BR enemy was somebody right the greatest enemy I William May Bram God is William Bram how can brother Bram be an enemy of brother Bram everybody clear this is Brother Bram everybody clear this is Brother brandham the greatest enemy brother brandham have is brother Brandon amen the greatest enemy I got is William BR he is the one that gets in God's way he is the one that get what not your body he's the one that get to a place sometime where he think he can do something about it I know what I'm doing I know I know I know do you want to do I know I know I know I'm good I'm good and when he does that show God right out of the picture in other words when you take the steering wheel God goes back in a passenger seat and watch you until you hit an accident but when I can get rid of that guy I can get him off the driver's side when I can get to a place that is out of the way fasting then God can come over and do things that William Bram knows nothing about if you want to reach higher height with God learn to surrender learn to acknowledge your weakness learn that you are nothing that is what God can use you that is when God can use you that is when he can use any of you he can use anybody when he when we get out of the way but as long as we get ourself in the way then he we cannot improving his word brother Bram say no to heal I cannot you know that what is a gift brother brandham something that take you no it is something you know how to do what get yourself out of the way that is a true gift see as long as you are theread it shall never work William Bram is the the greatest enemy I got but when I can get him out of the way then Jesus can use the everybody clear praise the name of the Lord we talk about the three stages of the reformer the face of a man Luther Wesley on down to the Pentecostal everybody clear so far let's go now to Esther chapter 5 that was just our intro now let's get to what we need to know if you there you can say Amen last week we finished chapter 4 now it's chapter 5 we're making a point your enemy is not outside your enemy is with you when you go to church you take him when you go to the presence of the king you must take him also amen verse one now it came to pass on the third day we already explained to you third day last week everybody clear on the third day that Esther put on her royal apparel we already explained to you last week what that Royal apparel was and stood in the inner Court the holy of holiest of the King's house opposite the King's house and the King sat upon his Royal throne in the Royal House opposite the Gate of the house everybody clear so far and it was so when the king saw Esther the queen standing in the court that she obtained favor Esther is coming on the first day second day on the third day on the justification we explain you sanctification now we in laia the baptism of the Holy Ghost everybody clear no all ordinarily we thought it was three days then the fourth day it didn't happen that way amen we are on the third day and the King held out to Esther the golden scepter we already explained this that was in his hand so Esther Drew n and touched the top of the scepter verse three then said the king to her what will you so there is a will here or a want everybody clear what will you Queen Esther and what is your request your want your will it shall be given to you to the half of the so the king as soon as Esther approached him he automatically presented two things he said either you can take the wheel or you can ask whatever you want up to the half not the full the half of the Kingdom everybody clear the first thing is the will the second thing is the kingdom she's calling Jesus on the cross and everything we already know that we in the Pentecostal age in Luke 11:2 save your time here the Bible says and he says unto them when ye pray say Our Father which are in H be th thy what everybody clear everybody clear Kingdom thy kingdom come thy what everybody clear are we okay now th will be done as in heaven so in what amen so Jesus when he was talking to his disciple he said when you pray always ask for the will and the kingdom of God and when Queen Esther is approaching the king the king automatically presented the two things what do you will and what do you want up to the kingdom I have the will and I have the kingdom Jesus say ask the will and the kingdom but not your will but the will of the father in 1 John 5:14 the Bible say and this is the confidence that we have in him that if we ask what according to what when you are asking something according to the will of God it is no more your will it is now the will of God hallelujah if we ask anything according to his will he does what that's why it's important to know your Bible it is important for you to read the word so when you ask God you always must couple your request with a promise you bring a promise to God you say it is written this is why I'm asking when you take your request and you put it in the word and you present presented to God it is no more your request it becomes God's word Ephesian chapter one why is that important in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being what predestinated according to what the purpose of him who does what work of all things everything after in other word ACC coding after the Cel of what amen so when it's the will of God God will do everything he can to fulfill his will amen so just make sure what you desire in your life it is according to the word of God if what you need in your life is according to the word of God so now it's notal because if it's his word God will never let his word return to him void when the word is released he will fulfill that with which he was sent to be accomplished everybody clear so far I read this and I'm going to read it again I wonder if we are sufficiently impressed with the word in our midst let me give you a thought here how do we pray we pray in Jesus name don't we every prayer is in his name or there is not any answer because it's not according to his will he said whatever you pray in my name so when you pray in his name you don't pray in his name no answer guaranteed 1 John 5:14 this is the confidence that we have we just read it that if we ask according to his will he hear us and if we know that he hear us whatsoever we ask we know that we have the petition that we desire of him now we ask what is the will of God God there is only one way to know his will and that is by the word of God the word of God is the will of God make sure whatever you ask ask it according to the will of God if God say ask red you don't bring him yellow he's not going to get it if God say bring me purple you don't give him blue if you align your we with purple God will automatically Grant his request which is your word everybody clear praise the name of the Lord hallelujah after that we found out that not only is the will but half of the Kingdom why half we know that Esther was married to the king and as being married to the king they are joined her together the Bible says in Romans CH 8:1 17 and if children then hair we have an inheritance hairs of God and what Jo H with who that's why we need a half of the Kingdom you see when you teach those stuff people in the message are so afraid to take God at his word what was in God he ped that in who can you say Amen what was in ch he P that in who let me help you again I know we we getting deep water there when God created man he created man in what his image okay so the man that came out was in the image of God everybody clear you ready but we found out that man when he came out he came out male and female so the image of God is what everybody clear can I repeat it again Man was created in the image of God God is God is a spirit according to John 4:21 amen when God created the spirit man he was creating something brother Bram say that which he was creating look exactly like the Creator himself so when he created it instead of that Adam comes and being a man because God is a man the one who came is Adam and Eve so God is not complete without you amen amen are you there so what God did in Genesis 2 he just picked Adam everybody close anybody understand me and built the body for Adam and pull the spirit of Adam and put it in the body amen amen then he begin to create animals when he create them m female male female male female that's why he turned around he said it is not good for Adam to be what because Adam was already [Music] double everybody clear now to bring Eve out of Adam he put Adam to what and he he perform a surgery and he pull a by product and pull it and put it there when Jesus Christ came the Bible say Jesus was the second Adam are you there so when Jesus was walking somebody was inside [Music] [Applause] Jesus amen when Jesus was resisting the devil you are inside Jesus [Music] when Jesus was walking upon the Water you are walking upon the Water that's why Jesus said the work that I do you can do it also and matter of fact you can do [Applause] even Hallelujah before Christ di on the cross the bride was still there he was pregnant in other word he picked evil and when he's killing the devil chasing Devil he's showing Eve you see how I do it Hallelujah you see how I do it you see how I do it you see how I do it that's why brother brandham say when he was resisting the devil he was showing that any Christian amen if he can take God at his word in other word if you remember what he did and you do the same thing you can overcome the devil any we any place under any circumstances everybody clear and when he reached the cross what did he do he put Adam to sleep and the Roman soldier came with a sword instead of hitting the sword here he doesn't put the spe here the spirit doesn't go here the spirit goes only here hallah hallelujah do you think your me is bothering you no he's pushing you to the right place amen those trial are just pushing you to the right position when she when he took the spear and put it there what came and what why he didn't just came blood when a woman give birth what comes first and then and then Christ was giving birth like Adam are you there the bread has been born right there that's why he said it is I already showed you from beginning to the end now come out and continue my work are you there so that's why Queen Esther if I want to give it to you I'm going to give you what half it is male and female half 5050 we are joint the Bible even says that Jesus is our brother you are [Applause] God are you there when he are self-existing you are also self-existing that's right Hallelujah don't listen to the sermon in the body listen to the sermon inside here because we got to leave this earth we need a higher Faith than just a faithful headache Revelation 3:21 Hallelujah yeah we good behold I stand at the door and do what like the sh If any man hear my voice and open the door there is an invitation that is coming from the bride now it is not the king organizing it is the Brad sending the invitation you okay now it is Esther going to the king to bring him back to his home amen I will come into him and will St with him there is a banquet and he with me okay which age is this laition we all know that to him thou overcome will I gr to sit with me in the throne beside me can you wake up and read that scripture if not open your Bible to him thou overcome I will grant him to sit on the chair beside my Throne how many Throne do we have in heaven here Israel the Lord your God is how are you going to sit on the same throne with Christ hallelujah hallelujah one son Christ is already seated how are you going to se half of the Kingdom half of the kingdom are you there when we say Throne we look at two chairs that is Earthly Kingdom where you see the Queen of England and the King of England that is Earthly over there it's one throne and there is only one person that is sit there when I come I don't think twice I just go where he seated and I sit also when you look you see him let me let me help your brain in other word when you get to heaven there is two choices either Jesus have to get out and you sit on the throne oh Jesus have to push and you squeeze together like push a little bit push a little bit amen make sense that is for the age of La that's why the king say Queen Esther what is the will what is the kingdom but the kingdom to the half because it's John Hair It Is husband and wife amen what belongs to the bride belongs to the groom amen praise the name of the Lord let's jum down to Esther chapter 4 and verse 4 Everybody clear praise the name of the Lord then said the king to Esther verse three what will you Queen Esther and what is your request it shall be given to you to the half of the kingdom and Esther answer if it seems good you see according to the will of the king not according to me I am asking if he he agrees with you if he agrees with your word if he seems good to the king let the king and hmon come this day to the banquet that I have prepared for him now there is an invitation here to the banquet of Hammon instead of just inviting the king Esther is inviting the man that is causing trouble hon in other words I'm not going in the presence of the king myself I have a trouble I have a problem I have an amalekite by the name of hon the Amite is the trouble the am malachite is the problem when I go in the presence of the king I am taking him with me everybody clear but the first banquet now we in the first banquet it was not for hon everybody clear it is a banquet that was prepared for the king when the banquet is prepared for someone in other word that person is the man of Honor all the attention will be drawn to that person everybody else in that banquet will be spectator you will just be there to fill in the chair fill in the blank but you are not the one to be entertained John the Baptist says something about the friend he say he that has the bride is the bridegroom but the friend of the bridegroom there's two kind of friend John the Baptist was a good friend to the bridegroom because he was the one preparing the way but Judas was also a friend and Jesus told him is that the way you betray friend he call him a friend there was two kind of friends everybody there but the purpose is this the point is this that he that has the bride is the bridegroom that is Esther and then the king but the friend of the bridegroom hon which standeth and heareth him rejoice greatly because of the bridegroom voice in other words I'm just there I am the best man I am not the one getting married my body is getting married to his wife but when I'm there as a best man I'm just clapping hand I'm a spectator that is what he's saying so they are calling amen come into the queen come with the King why do you need to come amen let's go to verse five and then the king say cause hon to come slowly are you there cause hon to come how when your desire is according to the word of God once he reach heaven there is a command quickly for the devil to obey you need to have faith and we got to teach these things then the king say cause hon to make Hast that he may do as the King has [Music] said can you look at your Bible is that what he says is that what he say make haste that he may do as who so the command of Esther the request of Esther unto the king becomes a command to the [Music] devil when the brde will recognize who she [Music] is if the wife truly knows her husband and she knows that her husband really love her if she get around that husband and put her hand like this and say honey you in trouble praise the name of the Lord Luke chapter 18 and the Lord say he what say the unjust judge and shall not God avenge his own what his brother the which cry day and night like Esther unto him though he bear long with them I tell you that he will avenge them what quickly make him quickly why the elect is crying the elect is asking and the what the elect is asking is according to my word and this is my wife this is my church that I die for it and I pay the for it and I accepted Calvary and I was stapped for them because of that go quickly let it be done according to your according to your faith if you want to keep waiting 25 years stay there I don't have time for that I need God to answer for my child I need God to answer for my family I need God to answer for my wife I need to be in peace because Calvary PID the price that's why brother Bram say we are living below our privilege why should I wait why does a police officer have to wait for the red light if he has an e Mery why does the ambulance have to come and stop at the red light if somebody sick what does the ambulance do they turn on there and guess what whether the light is red or it's green or it's yellow they just cross the light I am in emergency why should I wait you need to learn God amen amen the king is now invited brother vam say Jesus is never invited unless he I'm just telling you the word just remember that if you want him in your house whether it's a physical house or this house amen if you want him in your house what do you do in faith he will come no matter who you are or how rich or how poor or how bad off or how well off he will come if you invite him he never turns down an invitation if they call him to a house to make fun of him to ridicule him to leave his feet like that and and Jesus accepted that how much more if you call him are you going to call him to ridicule him but why is he going there and he doesn't come to you Hallelujah they get into the banquet let's go to verse six okay and the King said to Esther at the banquet of what we know the seven days Feast was the Feast of wine and this is also the banquet of what wine we still there we are on the first second third day this banquet is on the third day remember and if you notice yeah just came back to me the Esther never went to the king and say I'm inviting you to the banquet do you say yes or no are you going to come or not then the king say let me check my schedule he say yes I'm going to come then es say okay give me some time I'm going to cook food for you so you can come I was trying to make sure that you going to accept you not busy then you can come that's how we pray amen that's how we pray we go first ask and we wait for symptoms amen once we get the result then we begin to move into it EST prepare the banquet before asking do you want me to repeat it again I'm reading to you the scripture Esther prepared the banquet prepare everything before asking the king amen maybe this man was telling her do you know the king schedule this man was telling her the king is a busy man what tells you that he's available for you today amen maybe they're not going to see you if he doesn't give you the golden scepter they're going to kill you why are you wasting your time okay even though if the king accept but if he's busy everything you have cooked will be spoiled you have to cook over tomorrow if he tells you I'm going to come in two days what are you going to do all of that was in Esther mind that's right amen but Esther never pay attention to this person amen Esther begin to cook then this person say what are you doing you crazy do you have the answer yes or no es keep cooking put what the king like put what a king like put what a king like put what the king like do you have a guarantee that the king is coming have you talked to him on the cell phone did he already

spirit and begin what Esther begin to get consecrated are you following me crying to God for a new what on the last age such as he was in the first century at the Jews what seems to be the answer Kim seems to be the answer Kim as many began to do what to speak in tongue and to manifest the gift of the spirit so people thought the outpouring of Aza Street people begin to speak in tongue people begin to prophesy Healing The Sick all of that people say now we are restored back to the Apostle that's what they thought but they miss it it was the first banquet of Esther it's not going to touch himon everybody clear he was then believed that this was indeed the long awaited what rest the people thought we are restored we are back again before you know it somebody can speak in tongue and cheat and lie and do all kind of stuff even a gay can speak in Tong amen he was he was for the latter R can only come after the the for which is the spring of the teach amen the lading then is the Harvest everybody following me how could this be the real thing when the teaching R had not come they have not taught the people right because Elijah must come and restore all things are you there the

6 where mod revealed the son of man to the public this Bible mathematically mathematically placed the people thought they were writing chapter one they didn't know what they were doing they were riding it for this message Hallelujah praise the name of the Lord in it in the first banquet are you there in the outpouring of Aza Street in it was what I want you to read with me Lord help me where am I at yeah I got to finish in six minutes in it was what of the amen is there of the unrighteous partaking of the that's why a man is in the banquet drinking and eating without being bothered are you there the rain come on the tears and on the wheat and The Tear rejoice and the wheat also rejoice when brother Bram look at one he's sleeping with another woman he's married yet he's prophesying brother Bram troubled that was the first pouring the devil also enjoy in the first banquet but wait for the second banquet Hallelujah in it was a mixture of the unrighteous partaking of the spiritual blessing and manifesting in the Holy Ghost as we have kept pointing out to you in it also was the what hon hon the devil power as men were under the control of what yet not one seems to do what they thought if you speak in tongue you have the Holy Ghost and the devil was still there speaking in tongues living any kind of Life the first banquet but when Esther when Aon left that banquet and come

talking about it is who who has got a hold in their life through and difference and disease but you should see the that's why the face of a man is changing it is the click on the second pool amen Satan knows he's going to be exposed and the most pecular changes come over the people what Satan is what he hat Modi because Modi every time brother Bram come he's saying you sin there the reason why you are sick is because you steal something there go repair that and you're going to be Satan don't like that he was feasting with Pentecostal you steal you smoke you go to church you speak in tongue

certain person you see their face doing what am man is changing the second pole you see they don't know what to think all at once the Holy Spirit comes down and expose that devil oh he hate that kind of a meeting that's the reason why we have such a battle because of the word of God exposes the devil it tells what he is that is your first phase of the second pole are you there the discernment of the spirit then Aon went home Angry and when he got home he exposes three part we're going to see that next time let's stand remember we stop in Esther 5 chapter 10 next time we're going to pick up 5 chapter 11 on down and we're going to see there the first stage of the second poll is a discernment of the spirit and the second stage of the second pool will be in chapter six where he's revealing the the son of man the king stays in the palace but there is one that take the king horse we saw brother Bram driving on the king horse going westward in the in the horse that was called the word and

they took Eve a rib out of Adam and made Eve from Adam's side and how the bride was brought forth on the cross I also got to thinking about how 3 Days Later Christ Rose from the grave and how we're getting close to this Rapture we're in the last days and church I'm excited I'm excited you see the things of the world brother Chism was preaching ing for us Wednesday night brother Isaiah Chism and he was talking about how when we see the craziness of the world and and the homosexuality where they pass laws form and different things and it Grieves our spirit but inside something is rejoicing because we see how close we are to the end and it's so true we're so close so it's not time to play games but it's time to dig into the word and and know what we stand on give a revelation a stronger revelation of what we stand on so we can get home so I'm casting all my kids on you oh I know you love me amen and it's Redemption by Blood and that's the greatest love story and foration for
