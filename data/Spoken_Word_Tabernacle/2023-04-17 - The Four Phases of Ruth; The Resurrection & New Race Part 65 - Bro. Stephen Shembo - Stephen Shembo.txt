it was one day we need to search for a place just bring all of them together let me just sit down and talk to them when you talk to them it's amazing what you're hearing I'm learning a lot and really the word is soaking in amen when I see the way they are Discerning things I'm like my God this thing is working amen praise God so I'm proud of you amen glory to God we're not that just here to be whooping somebody when you do good stuff we gotta acknowledge it and encourage you and say praise the Lord for what he's doing in your life amen amen we greet you all in the precious name of our Lord

I see your hand please Glory Glory if you're behind just make sure you catch up amen we don't want you lagging behind amen I believe and I hope that everybody is continuing with the Cod book right at least one question a day one question a day you will build you up a lot and if you finish the church ages get to the 70 weeks of Daniel and by the time the Lord opened the way where we can touch him it's going to be easy on you I'm not saying go read it so you understand everything that's not what I'm saying amen whether you understand or not just go ahead and read it let the material soak in by the time we move in everything will be good amen welcome brother call and sister Laquanda born Amen brother Mike Daly's neighbor God richly bless you and welcome to spoken words amen Glory Glory Hallelujah we don't have visitors so don't look at yourself as visitor you are family member God knew that he have to place brother Mike there so from there we can find some extended family member and we can be joined together amen Glory Glory Hallelujah we have a wonderful question and answer yesterday at least I was able to read to do what four four of them so God was really gracious to us so the next session for question and answer will be May the 27th so it's a month and weeks May 27 I hope there is nothing no event going on because sometimes we've set up the date and before you know it somebody has a birthday or somebody have something so we have a month and one week or two weeks so if there is an event big event let us know amen okay amen I have the yellow bazooka over there that one worked all the time amen okay praise God and I had the chance by God's grace to approach couple important uh question on music and that helped me uh cover the last part of music so I call that music part three so it was one hour and 34 minutes and 21 seconds so if you put music part one music part two music part three it gives you almost 7.9 which is eight hours sermon everybody okay yesterday we talk about the dancing we believe in dancing but there is the right kind of dancing and we set up the tune for your uh reception in this church if you want to uh celebrate how do you celebrate with a Christian song how do you celebrate god with a dancing what is the purpose of you dancing amen so that's what I want I know some of you are not here but pray so that the Lord will allow me to release those tapes so you can go back at home and pick up your Bible and get the message of the hour and verify everything that I gave you because you have nothing to do with my culture with my origin with any country but I gave you the word from the scripture and the word from the prophet in other words in every country whatever I have delivered it will help you distinguish between a correct Christian music and what is not correct amen I'm saying that because I'm I'm seeing a lot of foolishness online is my microphone okay okay I can't hear myself back here amen amen it is the devil I know what is coming up amen you know what let me let you sit a little bit if something is wrong you want me switch okay praise God praise God so he's in trouble amen I was saying that I've seen a lot of foolishness that are going on and the devil has been using the door of Music especially in the message and that's the door he's using more to bring worldiness amen so if you don't want to Spirit in your house or in your house on your husband or your wife Mama watch the music you're listening to Daddy watch the music you're listening to young people be careful what kind of music you're listening to amen if we want to celebrate we have a wedding we have a birthday it's okay to use music but you gotta know which music we use because yesterday we gave you the guideline if you open your door to be listening to anything you're going to be responsible for spirit and you will wonder why our kids struggling with certain spirit because all of those Spirits are coming through the channel of music I'm not talking about secular music I'm talking about what we call Christian music if you have a problem I have part one part two part three that I explain everything so before God I have done my job and it's your responsibility to make sure you stay in line with what the word of the hour say and the Holy Scripture amen so he has nothing to do with your country everything comes from the word and the prophet and when I'm pulling something from the scripture and from the message of the hour I will never back up I don't know if you get me if something that I'm presenting is coming from the Bible and the message of the hour I would not even Dodge from one inch I will remain with it because I know I'm responsible as a Shepherd to stand for the word and to make sure everybody is protected under the word because the word is a fortification and the word is our protection if I let down the bar then it's going to be a problem Amen brother Branham say music it's another way of preaching the gospel so every time you open your door to a music you are listening to a gospel and you won't want me to come here and preach Baptist Doctrine you don't want me to do that so make sure what you're listening is according to the word of the hour I gave you quote where brother Barnum says that everybody okay this Wednesday we have our first night where we will preach for 30 minutes and go into prayer amen so if you have a big request if possible before Wednesday send it to Brother John or to brother said and so we can put it on or put it down in a box so when we start praying we will pray together if you don't want your name to be known you can let me know and don't put your name say just pray for me for something like this or it might be something uh private just go ahead and put it up so when you we start praying we will mention your request and as a church together we will pray and make sure the Lord whatever two or three I gather in his name so that maybe your prayer cannot break through our prayer together we'll pray together and make sure that whatever is there is busted out completely and somebody is set free amen that will be this Wednesday so if you can give your request before Wednesday that will be better don't wait till like seven o'clock at 7p p.m then you start sending requests then at that point it's a little bit hard amen I accept if it's an emergency praise God we understand what's going on on April 30th this month that will be brother Abraham Mara and the young Sisters Meeting I'm waiting I'm waiting for your response to let me know if the date is correct and brother able I'm still waiting to hear from the patriarch the future patriarch when we need to meet amen the young sister are far ahead of you so make sure you work with the patriarch I call them the patriarch because they're going to be the head of the family amen so we can meet together and talk I believe I got everything covered by the grace of God so let's go ahead to our scripture this morning so Brother David should I remove this completely okay so give me a minute and we go from there it's uh Genesis chapter 2. somebody's witnessing how I'm removing the armor but I got another one a slingshot amen we built a lot through theophany a lot of things to reach this point so if you have been consistent with the sermon you will pick up quickly and we will move on everything that we were building we were coming to this point amen so make sure you stay alert and everything will be okay Genesis chapter 2 verse 21 if you dare you can say Amen the Bible says and the Lord God you remember this now cause a deep sleep to fall upon Adam we know Christian don't die they sleep in other words Adam was almost put to death in tap he was put to death everybody okay and he slept and he took one of his ribs and close up the flesh instead thereof and the rib which the Lord God has taken from man made he a woman and brought her to the man you might be seated so before God begin to manufacture or to create Eve God took a rib everybody okay and this rib is a portion or a part of Adam amen so if started from Adam we already built a whole lot amen in other words the building block the building block or the foundation or the very beginning of Eve if started as a part of Adam everybody okay if I can call if I make a rib like this amen this is a portion of Adam amen everything that surrender this rib amen that's what made Eve but the beginning of Eve inside the eve at the very bottom of Eve there is a part of Adam so when you look at if she's a woman but inside of Eve there is a part of Eve that belonged to Adam everybody okay everybody okay so Eve have a part of Adam put inside of her [Applause] if it's not completely woman she has a part of a male that was put into her everybody okay glory to God verse 20 3 the Bible say and Adam said this is now water bone of my bones Adam said that when he woke up because he was put asleep so there is a death of Adam in type and then Adam was resurrected amen when Adam resurrected and when Adam looked at Eve amen they resurrected Adam look like they fabricated Eve let me start it again after God finished to create Eve amen God created Eve in reference to Adam everybody okay so if Adam is human Eve must be human if Adam is a bird Eve must be a bird everybody okay because Adam said that this is now Flesh of My Flesh because Paul says that we have different flesh you remember that in First Corinthians we have a flesh for the bird a flesh for this and a flesh for human but when Adam look at Eve he look at the flesh the material of Eve he said wait a minute another word this time I can see I mean a specie a creature that look exactly like me amen she is born of my born and she's Flesh of My Flesh in other words from inside Bond s are invisible you can see them through the skin unless the car wreck then we can see the bones amen they are inside and then the flesh is what you see outside amen so when Adam woke up the inside of evil are we together there is two part of you that need Redemption I'm building up okay the inside of you of Eve and the outside of Eve look exactly like Adam that's why Adam say this is now born of my bone and this is now Flesh of My Flesh in other words 100 this woman look just like me in other words this woman is me in a feminine version [Applause] amen so this woman was just me and me and this woman we are any question let's go to Roman chapter 8. like I said everything we built on God is male and female they did all of that together we coming to this point amen yeah these are not sermon that you preach one time and you get everything you're going to see a quote then the court will cause you problem to for another coat and things like that so you got to build it up completely until you get to this point so the inside and the outside must look the same like Adam amen when Adam woke up when I'm saying when Adam woke up in tap Adam was put to sleep which mean death then Adam was resurrected everybody okay so the way Adam looked after his resurrection are we okay the way Adam looked after the resurrection after his Awakening or after his resurrection amen is exactly the way Eve was Amen in other words if Adam woke up and he's an angel Eve must be an angel because Eve must be born of born and flesh of Flesh in other words Eve must be identical to Adam he must look like Adam he must be like Adam only in a female version the only the only difference is one is male and another one is female but when you have male and female you put them together then they wanna are we okay Romans chapter 8 verse one uh verse 11. if you dare you can say amen amen glory glory but if the spirit of him that raise up Jesus from the dead when we talk about Adam this is in tap that was the first Adam we got the second and the last Adam and that Adam is the Lord Jesus Christ and we know that Jesus took his bread with him on Calvary and just like God Pierce Adam God Pierce Christ amen and from there was Paul debride you understand this already now the Bible said but if the spirit of him that raise up Jesus from the dead dwell in you so that Spirit was dwelling in Jesus amen then that Spirit resurrected Jesus from the dead amen so if that Spirit dwell in you it shall also Quicken your mortal Body by his spirit that dwell in you so before that Spirit Quicken your mortal body that Spirit must first dwell in you [Music] in other words your inside must first have the spirit that was in Jesus Christ so that you and Jesus on the inside you begin to look the same now the problem is your outside is still different so but if it's already sad it is a confirmation for the rapture you remember Wednesday sermon crushed in you is a confirmation for the if that spirit is already on you it means the Rapture is already started I'm gonna get to that we okay we okay job to verse 18. if you dare you can say Amen Paul say for I reckon that the suffering of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory you got my the microphone my friend praise God with their Glory which shall be revealed where in US so there is a glory that must be revealed in you a glory to be revealed where amen job to verse 29. I skip a lot but you can read this at home and if you read Romans 8 you know where we're coming from verse 29 if you dare you can say Amen no verse 23 first then 29 I'm sorry you there and not only they nature but our self also which have the water spoon stop last Sunday who was the first fruit who was the first food now Paul is saying we have the first fruit so we have who Christ in us the hope of water we okay now we okay now you remember last last Sunday Jesus Christ was the first fruit of those that slept now Paul is saying that that first fruit is in US if you notice remember last Sunday was plural and if you look right here it's again plural do you see that now Christ is now with you and Hallelujah and not only they but ourselves also which have the water so this concerned the people that have crossed in them you any side of you there is the first fruit and the first fruit that is in you is crust crust in you the confirmation of the Rapture Christ in you the hope of glory and if you already have Christ in you as the first fruit if you notice here Paul is not calling Christ Jesus Christ he's calling Christ a first fruit but the first fruit is Jesus Christ Resurrected not the man of Galilee I don't know if we okay the man of Galilee they could kill him but the Jesus that Resurrected doesn't die the man of Galilee could not go across the world but the Jesus as a fresh fruit the one that came out from the grave that one could appear and disappear that's the one that is in you because Jesus told the disciple that a little while and I'm gonna be disappearing the world won't see me but you will see me because I will be till the end of the everybody okay are we together it's a different anointing my friend you will see it everybody okay verse 23 and not only day but ourself also which have the first fruit of the water the spirit amen even we ourselves do what do we groan why are you groaning because something is sticky around you on the inside you got the first fruit but there is a part of you Eve must look the same on the inside and on the other side Paul say on the east side you are already groaning you are crying you are pulling for something Jesus say you cannot take new one your boss just drop it right now and put it in the water he will do what today by myself so you so for you to put new one you must also have water so if the new one is already on you we need to find your new vessel [Applause] we okay now we okay we okay even we ourselves grown inside ourselves waiting for the water adoption that is the Redemption of water so adoption will now bring the outside to be redeemed like the inside when you receive Christ in you something happened on the inside but the outside can still get Coronavirus the inside doesn't get coronavirus if Corona virus enter inside it kills it everybody okay everybody okay job to verse 29. I'm skipping this quickly if you dare you can say Amen so the adoption that is coming the adoption that is coming is to reach the Redemption of the body in other word not in us but now outside we okay now verse 29 for whom he did what for now he also did water predestiness so it's a it's a Bible terminology to be conformed to the image of water so you are programmed to look like Jesus Christ you are programmed to look like your Adam whatever God is doing in you the final product you must look like your husband whatever God was doing on Eve the final product is for Adam to be able to look at Eve and say this is now Flesh of My Flesh and born of my born amen you have been predestinated in other words you are wired for it you are programmed for it whether you like it or not you're gonna be changed into that everybody okay even if you run away as you're running away you will see yourself changing everybody okay everybody okay a child of God would never run away from God you thinking you ran away he's under you you you are just under the radar for him he did for now he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that's the image we all want to be so there is one image but all of us will look like that image that's the stature of a perfect man not to look like me but to look like Jesus to be like Jesus amen that he might be the water first born among water many brethren in other words Jesus Christ is the firstborn among many Brethren but Jesus was already born and Jesus grew up how can he be again the firstborn Amen in other words Jesus was the firstborn as the first fruit that rich maturity he is a firstborn as the reference as the final product so that everybody have a reference of what we should look like in other words if God finishes with you we know how you must look like if you don't look like that God have not finished with you [Music] [Applause] if you die and you don't look like Jesus Christ God have not finished his work so even the Dead their work are not finished I don't know if you get me they're dead in Christ their life is over but their work is not finished because they die usually with a sickness or they die with a car accident but when Jesus Christ is coming Jesus will not Marry That kind of body the body that went uh in weakness and uh and with trouble no no no no no no no no no no the one that Jesus Mary must be like him so they work in the dead is not finished they're just waiting for the adoption to reach the Redemption of their body the body that we bury there that's not the end [Applause] when we bury them we put them as a seed so that they can grow but when he goes as a seed what comes out [Applause] so don't expect your loved one to look the way that they went [Applause] I don't know if you get me don't even take the old picture when they were sick put that in the trash [Music] they tell you gonna see them [Applause] amen [Music] in other words once they open the process it doesn't stop it's moving from one step to another it's a Cascade it's a sequence of events amen the problem is do not open it as long as it's closed the devil will play with you but the day they will open the package [Music] amen is just a matter of time if the devil sees you green today one of this day he will see you yellow [Applause] if you were a caterpillar today that's what he plays with one of this day you're gonna be a butterfly because you're going through procession amen being a caterpillar he can step on you push you no problem but as a butterfly you will be looking at him on the end like this can you chase a butterfly in the air try to chase one one day you'll find yourself in the ditch everybody okay everybody good let's go to Ephesian father Glory Glory Hallelujah Ephesians chapter 5. I will see how the Lord will lead because I have to go slow and this have to sink in because as it's moving all the sermon that we went through will begin to come back to Human you there Ephesians 5 verse 25 if you dare you can say Amen husband love your wife even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it that he must sanctify and cleanse it with the washing of the Water by the word that he may present it is where we're going he presented to himself so God prepared his brand to present that Brad for herself for himself amen but there is a way that he's preparing his blood he's preparing his blood according to his test he want that bread to be a certain quality what are the qualities of that bread the Bible says that he might present it to himself a water now the one that you bury was was that person looking glory in the casket did you see them with glow in the casket that's not the one Jesus will come to get the final product the final product must be glorious amen amen glorious Church having not having water no spot and Sport means what no sins amen comma or water wrinkle where do you get wrinkle so the one that you put in a grave there with wrinkle is that the one that will see Jesus Christ in other words when they come from there no wrinkle no wrinkle Winkle is picking up the body and it's speaking of death in the body because it's death that continue to work on you until you get wrinkle white hair and until you die death in other words God will remove death in the aspect of sin everybody okay the first if you notice that started first they didn't say without wrinkle and with that spot they start with spot first because spot is dealing with the first aspect it deals with the inside we okay now and then the recall is dealing with the second part which is dealing with the outside everybody okay he always follow after the work of God start first everybody okay when you start inside it's automatic in other words they turn on the automatic if you start outside then it's a legalistic because the inside is still fighting back it won't work it will be a bunch of loss kill the inside that's it glory to God he said with that spot or wrinkle comma

everybody okay everybody okay we are completely on the on roof chapter four and as Ruth make her journey into the Tabernacle this is what brother Branham says brother Branham says this glory to God hallelujah brother Branham says this he says that is what the church did he entered into justification under Luther he went into sanctification and the Wesley went into the baptism of the Holy Ghost in This last days everybody okay and now it is resting with the earnest of our water inheritance so when you receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen it is not really the complete inheritance everybody okay when the Holy Ghost [Applause] when the Holy Ghost enter inside of you amen what you are receiving is an honest or a down payment amen it is a done payment of an inheritance in other words somewhere there is your inheritance amen you have now received that inheritance yet but God sent you an earnesty a portion of that inheritance when you receive the Holy Ghost [Applause] everybody okay everybody okay in other words when you receive the Holy Ghost you have part of this inheritance already knew hey everybody okay you are just missing the remaining part of your inheritance what is this inheritance everybody good glory to God brother Branham say and now resting with the earners of our inheritance that we know that something happened where in us not outside of us in US we still inside we have passed from water life death and to water life we pass from death and to life in US not outside and we are doing water and doing water you remember the groaning on Roman 8 we are groaning with water nature Roman 8 for that time when we shall receive a water Immortal Life remember when the Holy Spirit come in you you already receive eternal life all you already

fullness when you receive the Holy Ghost they remove a chunk amen this chunk is now in you right here everybody okay there is the fullness that is there everybody okay follow me carefully he said any motor fullness when you receive an immortal fullness what happened our body will be water redeemed so the portion that you receive is only to Quicken the inside of you everybody okay they remainder of your inheritance is responsible for the quickening of your body everybody okay we are two-part amen we have the inside of us and we have the outside of us amen everybody okay the outside that's what we call the body the inside that what we call the soul and our spirit if you die now we will remain with your outside your inside is gone everybody okay so when you receive the Holy Spirit you receive the earnest that is taken care of the Soul and the spirit everybody okay whatever portion of the inheritance That Remain is remaining for your body everybody okay brother Branham say when we get the body will be redeemed then what everything else is water and we are just waiting for him to return back from the water okay where Powers is amen and when he returned from the gate then he can pick up roof and roof can change dimension everybody okay now put your seatbelt we ready when we talk about Easter we found out that Easter or the power the resurrection of Jesus Christ brought two things please follow me carefully the resurrection of Jesus Christ when Jesus Christ rose again he brought two things amen the first thing he brought a new specie amen or he brought a new race yeah everybody okay everybody okay that's number one number two the resurrection of Jesus Christ amen open the door remember last Sunday for the baptism of the Holy Ghost for eternal life to enter into human being everybody okay everybody okay he opened the door for the baptism of the Holy Spirit to get there everybody okay and he opened the door for the resurrection everybody okay and we found out that when the baptism of the Holy Ghost come there is two form of God God is first the word everybody okay and then in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the word was and that word was made flesh everybody okay everybody okay so when Jesus Christ rose again number one he brought a new race he brought a new species number two Jesus opened the door for the new birth or the power of Resurrection to come into human being everybody okay when that power come into human being it brings to Resurrection we talked about it last time he brought the resurrection of the Inside Man which is touched by the word everybody okay and it will also bring the resurrection of the outside man everybody good everybody okay let's go to Ephesians 1. Glory Glory Glory Glory we got two Resurrection resurrection of the inside man that is done by the word the word will come and Quicken you amen amen so if Jesus is still in the form of the word he's still bringing Resurrection in the inside everybody okay the Jesus in the flesh will bring the resurrection of the outside let's go to Ephesians chapter one but remember without the resurrection of the inside there is no resurrection of the water because if the spirit that Rose Jesus from the dead dwelled then he shall do what Quicken everybody okay let's go to Ephesians 1. if you dare you can say amen amen Ephesians 1 verse 3 blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us you there with us spiritual blessings in Heavenly places in Hope Christ so there is a place where every blessing that you have need of is there is a Promised Land that have everything that Israel need if God can move Israel from Egypt and put them in the promised land then in the promised land they're gonna have honey they will have milk they will have houses they have never built then we have Vineyard Every Blessing was in a Promised Land so there is a place our promised land is not to go to Israel but we got another promised land and that promised land is a place where every blessing that God have for you God took all those blessing and put that in that place are you following me that place is called Heavenly places in Christ everybody okay so if you want your blessing you must be in that place you must be in Christ everybody okay everybody good there is a place where we got all our blessing that blessing our spiritual blessing reside in Christ which is called a Heavenly places amen every blessing that you need is there so if you're looking for a blessing find that place if you enter that place everything you have need of is laying right there how do we get there amen everybody okay watch verse 4. according as he has chosen us in water him when before the before the foundation of the world that we should be how holy is he ringing the bell is he ringing the bell that we shall be holy and water without blame before him how so the thing that God is working in you to accomplish is not something new it is something that God already have for you to be holy and without blemish are you following me in other words when God comes in you to start working in you God is not really doing anything new [Music] I don't know if you're getting me I don't know if you're getting me God when you were born in this world he took a package everybody okay and he put that package in you and that package was sealed do you follow me do you follow me so when this Holy Ghost come in you what the Holy Ghost is coming to do he's coming to cut the Amazon package [Applause] everybody okay and open the package and in that package your holy message already there I I don't know if you get me the Holy Ghost only come to cut the tie so that he cannot lose the package and open the package then inside the package everything that you need of is already there [Applause] [Music] [Applause] I don't know if you're kidding me I don't know if you're kidding me every time a Resurrection comes in your life he always bring something new come on by definition a resurrection is a replacement it is not a change [Music] when the widow woman loves her son when Elijah came and resurrect the baby the baby came up just a human and that baby grew up and died when Elisha a man rose up with the bunch of Elijah that man rose up after a while the men died everybody okay Lazarus Rose and Lazarus died the daughter of jerios Rose the daughter of jerias died everybody okay every resurrection that was in the Bible was only a replacement he was just the bringing back of that which went down if you went down in eight years old you come back at eight years old if you die 20 years old you come back 20 years old if you die 45 years old when they resurrect you you come back 45 years but the resurrection of Jesus Christ all right it's a different Resurrection he was not only the bringing back of something that was dead but that Resurrection brought also something new everybody okay everybody okay he brought something new that is different than the old one [Applause] I don't know if you're getting me God can raise you from the dead and you can die and go to hell [Applause] everybody okay that is just the power of Resurrection but the resurrection of Jesus Christ if he ever come on you everybody okay when he rise you up when he wake you up from the dead it doesn't just wake you up he wake you and change you [Applause] [Music] I don't know if you following me so if there is due Resurrection amen there is only also two new things that have to be created in you when God come in you in the inside of you he does and bring the all back of you back because you are born in sin you are shaping iniquity you love to watch bad movie but when God come in you he brings something new something that is completely different than what you were before it is different than your family [Applause] if your mother was mean and your father was mean if Jesus Christ come in you people will ask you was this really your father and your mother because you won't look like them on the body you look like them but on the inside you have nothing like them [Applause] I don't know if you're kidding me if your mama was appreciated and your daddy was a drug addict you must struggle with drug addict you must struggle with women but let Christ come in your life the day Christ come in your life if you show people this is my father when they look at you and they look at your father they don't understand how you came out from that family because when they come across your family it's a bunch of mean people but when they come to you you are sweet you are different What Makes You Different is you become a new creation [Applause] William Marion Brad he was a God man he was the son of God he was off the water man and God did water you got the volume man and God did what and did water he was the first of this new Grace everybody okay he's the head of this new race so there is a new race Colossians 1 18 and he is the head of the water body the church who is the water beginning the water first born from the water I'm gonna get to there sooner that in water all things he might have the water preeminence second Corinthians 5 17 therefore If any man beware in Christ no if you want to hold to your family staff keep holding it me I don't hold to nothing I let it go because that life put me in trouble [Applause] he didn't help me If I Had The Temper it came from a family if I was mean he came from my family maybe it was from your uncle sad or for your mother's side and you just inherited those stuff so that's why I don't hold anything for my family I let it go there is one family that I have 100 percent that family has a name the family of Heaven and Earth the name is Jesus Christ in that family we don't have high blood pressure problem we don't have diabetes problem we don't have stuff on this problem I don't know if you're kidding me so Paul is saying that all things are done water pass away behold all things are becoming water in other words the new birth in you the resurrection of Christ in you bring something completely new [Applause] amen yeah and that which is new is not just you it looks like Christ [Applause] he looked like God there you can see that true water man was off the water oh the order of water now in Union with her he has become a water of who a resurrection of Christ doesn't just bring you back but he brings something new [Applause] everybody okay everybody okay everybody okay if that Resurrection on the inside bring something new if that Resurrection ever touches your outside [Music] [Applause] it will also bring something new [Applause] Sarah was barren and Sarah could not have a baby [Applause] grew old and when she grew old God came and did something for sale we went through the scripture and made Sarah to be young again because later on Grandma when she went to abimelech abimelech begin to say oh grandma looked good he was not grandma with a king he was a young grammar everybody okay but when Sarah was changed from an odd woman to a younger woman God didn't just change Sarah he took the bareness out of Sarah [Applause] everybody okay because the Sarah that change could bear a baby the first Sarah could not bury baby he was not just a change but he was a change with a correction to bring something new [Applause] life [Applause] are you okay is everybody okay you still have your seat belt I'm gonna drop something everybody okay we got two Resurrection one Resurrection comes with the word to Quicken your inside and make you a new creature the second Resurrection will come with the Jesus Christ as a human being in flesh and when you will see Jesus in flesh just know that your flesh must look like his flesh when you see Jesus in the word it means your word will look like his word when you see him in flesh you mean your flesh now it's time for your flesh to look like his flesh [Applause] [Music] everybody okay everybody okay everybody good I'm gonna drop something you ready are you ready how many Resurrection do we have here these two Resurrection bring also to rapture [Music] [Applause]

everybody okay everybody okay these two Resurrection bring to rapture [Music] the first Rapture comes on your inside and he Rapture your soul [Music] [Applause] [Music] William Branham you still have your seat belted that is the way a Christian is we are water planted together in who Christ who is the water we are planted well in Christ and we just do water and do water and do others and everything we have need of for the Earthly water Journey water Divine Healing and what the power of God and all these are the thing is in water every in the individual that I have received the water the baptism of the Holy Ghost because all your blessings are in Heavenly places in water Christ Jesus everybody okay so you are planted well in Christ Hallelujah you still have your seatbelt you still have your seatbelt he says the Holy Ghost baptism yes sir and Walter everything you you have water need or for this life water Journey even the water reaction Israel right in you then [Applause] [Applause] Christ is new is the confirmation for the rapture let me read it again even the water is right the new weapon then don't resent that in either way don't push it off because your mind is saying be careful two Resurrection being how many rapture the first Rapture happened where can I continue he says even the Rapture is right in your word when when you receive the water don't resent that that is what the truth the Rapture is in us now I will prove it by the water gospel those who he has water cause he has water Justified and those who he has water justify he has done what glorified Hallelujah [Applause] amen glory god in his water why [Applause] [Music] let's go to Ephesians let's go to Ephesians in Ephesians 2. let's stabilize let me put some additional stabilizing screws amen when the Rapture come to take us it take us away we go anywhere we'll go into heaven if the Rapture of the souls come it must take you also to heaven everybody okay let's put some stabilizing through school okay I'm gonna put one here this is and another one there everybody okay everybody okay Ephesians 2 first one you there and you he has water Quicken who were how dead in trespasses and water sins drop to verse 6 now you there and has done what raised us up again if there is a resurrection Jesus have raised somebody struggling go back to verse 5. because you won't get it even when we were water in sins has he done water quickened us together who quickened us Christ with Christ by Grace you are water save and he has done what raised us up together meaning you are dead and when they Resurrection they need to take you up to a rapture everybody okay he raises up together and made us weapons sit together sit together well in Heavenly places in water Christ Jesus so your soul is raptured by the baptism of the Holy Ghost and God puts you in Heavenly places in Christ because that is the position where all your spiritual blessings are there that's why everything you have need of is already there everybody okay everybody okay everybody okay He blesses you right there and he Rapture your soul when your soul is Rapture then he put you in Heavenly places when you're in Heavenly places you are sealed amen you went to heaven Lord help me Lord help me God help me that's why brother Branham says this to the church Karma the water the bride the Rapture is a water Revelation to her before the Rapture become an event that will take your body out first the Rapture must be a revelation in you [Applause] your soul must be righteousness the baptism of the Holy Ghost is everything he make you a new creature he unfold the package of God he quickened you he activates you he put you in Heavenly places in Christ and he also bring a rapture of your soul [Music] [Applause] he says the Rapture is a water Revelation to her it is revealed to what that's the Revelation the True Blood of Christ will be water waiting for that revelation of the water rapture [Applause] for the Revelation is water Faith you cannot have a revelation without being here faith is the water because it's something that is water Revelation faith is something that has been revealed to you like he was to Abraham that could call anything contrary to what has been revealed to him as though he was now bye faith that is what faith is it is a revelation of who God the church is built upon them Revelation the whole entire body of God to Resurrection bring two things new and those two Resurrection are Kappa with two rapture first of all erupture your soul that's why your thinking is different [Applause] that's why when people talk to you you acting like somebody who's not around this country your affection are set on things air pose not to fix up the Earth when somebody talk to you they say which word are you living in are you in America so you don't know what's going on you say I don't know because you are living in another world you become a pilgrimer you become a stranger you seeking for a city who's Builder is God [Applause] you are no longer of this world you are born from another dimension something now is pulling you to a different world [Applause] church I'm good in time it is just the depth that we went everybody okay everybody good everybody good everybody good glory to God you still have your your seatbelt oh praise God so what are we talking now we understand brother Stephen now that the first Rapture hit our souls hit that Inside Man and our soul our rupture my Rapture Souls you know that song and you are now in Heavenly places you talk a different language you are like Abraham you can call things that are like they are not when they tell you you won't qualify for that loan you say I'm a son of God they say listen there is a pardon you must have a credit Discord you must have this you must have this you say that's not what I'm looking at I can call things that are not in existence as though they appear if they refuse everybody they're not going to refuse me matter of fact I'm gonna give you the date when my answer will come [Applause] because the things visible were made by things that are invisible [Music] the doctor said you cannot have a baby you say no I will have a baby because God said there won't be any barren woman not even a Barren dog [Applause] God taught Israel not even an animal would be barren if an animal have that blessing what about me [Applause] the Bible say we judge you who are bearing he loves your tent for the children of the desolate woman will be more than the other woman [Applause] which word are you living in a scientific word I don't live in that word I don't depend in science science failed me so many times everybody okay so our soul is resurrected and changed to a new creature we have been raptured that is the rapture of the Inside Man worry about the outside man everybody okay oh glory to God everybody okay glory to God glory to God everybody ready everybody ready everybody ready we found out that the resurrection of trust brought a new race or a new species amen and that Resurrection he brought two resurrections we went through that now which we call the true Rapture command together the Rapture of the inside and of the Assad or the resurrection of the inside and the outside we got you we got new amen we understand this now what is the species that the resurrection brought how does it look like what are the qualities [Music] of this picture this new race look like what are you okay are you okay can I keep going because my time is not up yet all right at 26 23. the bible say that Christ should suffer and that he should be the water first that he should do what rise from the dead there is an importance for him to be first because everybody must look like so we must see him first he must be the first product if somebody has rushed before him then we're in trouble we must have a reference he must be the first one so you start in other words even the Old Testament said say Hey you go first ah if they don't kill you we come [Applause] we were all resting on you we were all waiting for you job say I knew that my redeemer liveth we were waiting for you so you must be the first in line God the first one we will be following after you [Applause] everybody okay in other words if the first one come out and he looked then he can go to the hall and say hey guys everything is okay come out [Applause] and Ibraham say when they were younger people amen they used to go into or into a creek or somewhere or a pond to take a swim but sometimes the water is cold during the fall or winter so nobody want to jump in the water first everybody okay so they were looking for somebody to jump faster and tell us the temperature of the water and brother Branham was usually the first one [Music] everybody okay because brother Branham didn't have a nice coat [Applause] his parents were poor and brother brought them have a big old jacket that he was holding on and he has a pin that he was putting with that jacket so the other kids that they're going they need this one have to take the paint off and keep jumping and stop and remove the paint and remove the socks brother Branham didn't have to worry brother will Run and Jump into the air and when he's in the air he just removed and he put his hands like this they all could stay in

confirmation that the water is good come on boys jump the way you can jump the water is good we're ready to swim when brother Branham tells stories not stories [Applause] everybody good so Christ must be the first one First Corinthians chapter 15. but now is Christ done what risen from the dead and become the water first fruits of them that did what you know this you have your seatbelt do you have your seatbelt there we go Revelation 1 5 and from Jesus Christ who is the water faithful witness and the first water begotten of the water how can death be got something [Music] everybody okay everybody okay the bible say that Jesus was the first begotten in other words he was the first burst all the firstborn everybody okay in other words the resurrection of Jesus Christ was actually birthing new species [Music] everybody okay everybody okay Colossians 1 18. he is the head of the body the church who is the water beginning and the water first born from the water so death was giving birth everybody want everybody okay and the first one that was born from Death was Jesus Christ in other words the resurrection of Jesus Christ was birthing new creature he was bringing in life something that never existed before it was because Lazarus Rose and died everybody okay Moses Rose he will be killed all of them by Rose died again but when Jesus Christ Rose he was not just a bringing up of Jesus Christ they were birthing something new the dead was bringing birth it is a first born from the dead when he was releasing he was actually giving birth in other words that Jesus that went down in the grave and the Jesus that rose again are two different [Applause] [Music] swallow Jesus the man but when death released Jesus Christ the Jesus that came from the dead was not the same that got into them [Applause] [Music] if I don't finish this I have to lay the foundation follow me carefully Jesus when he died he was not a sinner thank you [Music] because Jesus said who can convince me of sin Jesus never seen but he died as a sinner everybody okay everybody okay so when Jesus was going inside the grave Jesus Took a package of sin do you follow me do you follow me and when he entered through death amen he went to hell and delivered the package to the devil everybody okay the Jesus that went in the grave was charged with sin the body of Jesus Christ has sinned [Applause] that's why God left him In The Garden of Gethsemane because he said father if you can take this cup away God said no no no you must drink it he said but nevertheless he looked he said what is this fornication father please come on not this he say you don't drink it look in 2020. look over there do you see your boy there you see what is he doing there you must drink it [Music] [Applause] Jesus look he found drug addict he said drug addicting my body not father God said no problem go in 1995. look at him in a nightclub if you want him to stay like that you leave this cup the only way I can set him free you must drink it [Applause] so everything that you have done bad in your life was in the cup of Jesus Christ do you follow me and Jesus took all your lying all your stealing all your smoking and he drunk it do you follow me when Jesus drunk it God said amen this was too bad I can't stay on you like this Jesus said but wait a minute you told me to join he said you're not good anymore God pull off do you follow me that's why Jesus was crying my father my father while her water they forsook him because of you [Applause] I don't know if you're following me amen amen so the cross that went into the grave went as a sinner of your sin and my sins do you follow me then he took the whole package do you follow me and put it together and went to hell and said devil this belonged to you Satan say what he said you know me who am I you say yes sir I know you're the Holy One have you seen the Holy One we've seen me and you were in heaven you know who started this game right it was you right oh so take it you say yes sir you're right everybody okay everybody okay when Jesus rose again he was with that sin [Applause] oh yeah what are the qualifications of the new race we okay number one qualification of the new race can I continue [Applause] cannot continue the number one qualities or attribute or attribute of this new race is this number one what is it oh Lord help me the Bible said in Romans 6 9 knowing that Christ being water raised from the dead raised from the dead daughter [Applause] because we must know how we must look like Jesus that rose again dies no more amen and death has what no more dominion over him so not only does he die death cannot do anything anymore to the Jesus that rose again in other words when death and Jesus meet again death have to take another Highway if Jesus is coming on 85 North death must take 85 South because if he meets Jesus Christ he remember what Jesus did for him has no more dominion everybody okay in Revelation 1 Verse 18 the Bible said I am he that was what live and I was how dead so he resurrected and behold I am how a life how forever more so the resurrection Jesus Christ is a love forevermore is eternal he doesn't die anymore it's a new species the Lazarus died but death could come again and kill him everybody okay everybody that rose again death could come and kill them but the resurrection of Jesus Christ is separate he has to be the first one and job said let's go ahead and let's see your product when he come out death doesn't work no more they took death they say go ahead and sting him again death sting he said guys you see it's nothing come on everybody okay really father you love forever more everybody okay everybody okay everybody good let's go to Luke 24. so I can run him Maya I Was preparing this I say I'm gonna preach this quick and finish this sermon today I am in wonder amen Luke 24. if you dare you can say amen amen we want to see the qualification the attribute how does crushed that rose again look like because when he rise we must be like him we know the Rapture of the inside we are talking about the Rapture of the outside but before we talk about how the Rapture happened we need to know how are we going to do what is the final product you say the first fruit fresh fruit means what first fruit number one means it doesn't die it is eternal Eternal forevermore Faith fruit means when you coming when deaf see you God goes into a different place you become a threat for death everybody okay Luke 24 verse 29 if you dare you can say Amen we're talking about the Jesus that rose again amen Jesus was going talking to the disciple on the road to Emmaus amen and verse 29 but they constrained him saying a bird with us for it is throughout the evening and the day is first spent and he went in to Terry with them came to pass as he started meet with them he took bread and blessed and broke and gave to them and their eyes were watered open and they knew him and he did water vanished out of their sight so the resurrection Jesus Christ can appear and talk to you and walk with you but he can also disappear [Music] it's a new species it's a species that can appear live a normal life and can also disappear it is not a ghost job to verse 36. amen amen are you there verse 36 and as the death spoke Jesus himself stood well the door were closed the disciples were talking so when they sit they were talking they begin to talk about him when they begin to talk about him suddenly Jesus is there in the midst of him they say oh we know this quality that's a ghost because that goes to who appear and disappear he says and thus Jesus stood himself in the midst of him and said to them be peace be to you but they were terrified and frightened and suppose that they have seen the water the spirit or a ghost and he said to them why are you trouble and why do thoughts arise in your heart behold my water and by water that is I myself handle me and see for a spirit has not what flesh and water as you see me water have Jesus resurrected his flesh and Bone how can flesh unborn appear and disappear Jesus resurrected his flesh and born in other words he had the human body he has a human body amen he said hey you thinking that I'm a ghost so if you're thinking Amigos come and touch me because according to the ghost if you put your hand like this your hand will go and pass and come this way because it's a ghost Jesus say go ahead and touch me so when you touch you get a blockage so this is not a ghost this is human being but they look they say wait a minute human being we understand but disappearing and appearing what kind of human being is this it is a new race it is a new species everybody okay verse 40 and when he has that spoken he showed them his hand and his feet and while they yet believe not for joy and wonder he said to them have you have any meat in other words yeah yeah it's a human being ah he say wait a minute give me a hamburger everybody okay everybody okay and they gave him a piece of brawl fish and of a honeycomb and he took it and did it before so Jesus resurrected was able to eat and he can drink and yet he can disappear and when he disappeared he disappeared with the drink that you gave him and the food that you gave him it doesn't mean when he disappeared you see the food on the ground everybody okay so as your natural food is entering his body there is something in that body that is transforming everything to a different material [Applause] [Music] if you fool you let me know let's go to the Book of John John chapter 20. I'm gonna hurry oh God help me John chapter 20 verse 19. if you dare you can say Amen we want to know how does this Jesus look like John chapter 20 verse 19 you there then the same day at evening being the first day of the week when the water doors let's go my brother I need some Force one day those who are water sure where the disciple were assembly for what fear of the Jews came Jesus and water in the water the resurrected Jesus Christ doesn't need the doors I told you in Luke but I gave you John so you can see that the disciple door will close in other words he doesn't need a door to be open he can just enter in your house and he's moving up he say how are you doing and the alarm doesn't even sound your ADT doesn't work your CPI doesn't work because his material is different [Applause] everybody okay everybody okay everybody okay job to verse 25. oh my God verse 25 they are the disciple therefore said to him to Thomas except that see in my hand in my hand in his hand the print of the nail and put my finger into the print of the nail and trust my hand in the sad I will not water so God knew there is a disciple that will struggle for the print and for the nail so God who knew everything say if I'm take Jesus Christ and I make disappear everything from him and make it to New these folks the way I know them they will have a hard time believing that is Jesus they will have a hard time believing that he was the one that crucified I need to leave a mark that will be speaking about the crucifixion so when they see the mark it will it's a it's an additional stabilizing School to stabilize somebody that look at the Mark now you understand that it's me because you need some extra screw to stabilize you you need some more scripture to help you up everybody okay everything look good on Jesus Christ except the print because the Jews need them according to the prophecy everybody okay and after eight days again his disciple went how inside I need more volume and Thomas with them then came home Jesus the dog being house and stood how in the midst and said Peace be to you the resurrected Christ doesn't die death has nothing to do with him He's Alive forevermore he appeared live normal life and can disappear he have a human body he can eat and drink he doesn't need for you to open his door when you see him you must be like let's go to the book of Hebrew let me at least lay this quality and then I must stop somewhere let's go to the book of Hebrew chapter nine we want to see they'll cross the road and then I'm gonna stop somewhere Hebrew

Ephesians 5 that God is washing his church he's watching his brother and the way he's washing you he's washing you by the word and the word he's bringing to you is meant to bring you to the final
