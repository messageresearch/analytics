and leaving Walmart without paying for the items amen with the distraction amen now they got them guards over there on himself check outs too and at the door so they've come over running over there at me one time I reached in front of the camera and it blocked them it says pretty serious he says because had the sensor beeped and gone off no amount of words of forgetting to pay or having the money will mean anything because the police would have been called it would have been called by then so I started home and started cooking some of the bag of rice I had just bought then instantly something told me you forgot to make payments for these items I panicked and started going through my account to see if I paid or not and I realized I didn't amen he says I stood up packed all the items including the sachet of rice I had already emptied and was and was cooking some off and headed straight back to Walmart because the police would have been called could have been called after I left being that at times the law states when someone is stealing leave them and just dial 911. he said and they will later post on the on for wanted person for stealing for Walmart amen he said I prayed I prayed on my way there and God told me God and God told God he knows I wouldn't even do this on purpose so he's talking with God now I would you know I wouldn't do this on purpose and and he should intervene for me amen upon arrival I saw the manager with a file and a few people in front of the security door as soon as I got inside Walmart I instantly panicked and thought Oh My could this be me they're talking about and waiting for the police for amen soon as I opened my mouth to narrate the story with all the plastic bags in my hand the manager just said oh my God she then told told me go to the customer service center and she will have them ring up my items and I paid for them so thank God greatly for delivering me for something as serious as this that would have affected me in every

name of the Lord but we appreciate you all this morning amen I trust that everybody is up to date with the sermon and I trust that you're reading your Bible I got a new version now the old version was raise your hand and hopefully and it seems like uh let me leave it alone so I trust by the grace of God you're reading your Bible you're reading your Cod book you're reading your church ages you're reading your 70 weeks of Daniel you're reading the seals and you're listening to the message of the hour amen I will remind you always and make sure your head is on the word amen we have a wonderful young men's meeting yesterday wonderful what you heard them [Laughter] [Applause] a wonderful we have young men meeting but yesterday it was super can you say Amen super in everything sister Laurel sister Joanne God richly bless you for the sacrifice we never seen something like that that was the first biggest sandwich we ever seen in our life if you have no clue what I'm talking about you need to see one of them it was how many this long how many free five foot so it's only for men so that was a man sandwiches I couldn't keep it to myself amen you might be seated a little bit so I took the I took a shot and put it on the young in the youth group of spoken words Tabernacle and had some pretty interesting discussion going on there amen wonderful but I could not help it that was wonderful everything went fine by the grace of God and it generated a lot of questions so I told them the same thing I told to the younger sister put your question together so the next meeting instead of moving forward we need to go back again and get the question and then answer and make sure everybody's there amen I'm sorry I didn't tell them this but I had to download a portion of the married couple material there because I was dealing with patriarch so they need to know certain things amen [Music] amen they were not aware of it I switched the USB I have to put another USB and download it just a portion enough amen the remaining when you get married I will handle it amen because they need to know how to deal with their mother everybody [Applause] you need to know how to deal with your sisters because a woman is an entire mystery let me leave it alone okay let me leave it alone okay amen it's an entire Ministry amen this whole message is about a brother the entire message that we have the entire word of God is about God coming to take his blood back amen glory to God Amen so as patriarch I had to give them a little glance of the world of women so they know how to deal with Mama they know how to deal with sister and they're going to be better husband to the wives amen he was just a portion that I downloaded and I have to take the USB quickly out amen the remaining you'll get it when you get married but I'm proud of them it was so relaxing brother Kelly thank you for your place everything went fine by God's grace how many hours was that brother brother Abel brother Kelly how many hours four and a half hours so somebody really got downloaded amen I look at brother Benjamin and say is this heavy he said a brother Stephen That's Heavy amen so somebody got really really good Mateo and they stretched pretty good because I don't want you to Google anything I don't want you to buy anything on Amazon I am here as a father as a spiritual father and a pastor is a full package so there is no area that we cannot cover we need to befriend and we need to be brother that's what was lacking in this message amen no judgment nothing open up and let's talk and move forward amen glory to God you should be there my friend amen four hours they got the one so I have to wait for the next Generation when they grow up a little bit when they start reaching 1617 then I downloaded again so do your best never to miss this kind of thing because I can't sit now four hours and start everything back up again amen so you got it you can deliver that and move forward then everything is good amen I am not afraid one bit because everything I deliver it's backed up in the Bible and back up by the message of the hour so I'm ready to go so if somebody won a war welcome amen so the best thing to do is just stay away so the next oncoming meeting for the Young's men meaning that's me I'll just speak playing so the next song coming meeting for the young men will be on September 9th amen how many heard that so September 9th we will be there at 2 30 again and then I'll get your question and move forward the reason why we have to push it in September 9th is on on August the 26th it's the young sister meeting follow-up on the meeting with their questions amen amen I'm not saying war that I'm ready to fight but what do I do with a sword why did they hand me the solder I'm fighting demon and I'm fighting religious spirit it is not a flesh and blood fight it's a spiritual war you got it so before somebody come up and say he's ready to fight everybody okay the next question and answer meeting will be on August the 12th which is this coming month so August 12th question and answer and August 26 the young Sisters Meeting on the follow-up of their last meeting and September 9th will be the Young's men meeting amen if possible do the best to check the announcement the Deacon sent an announcement before and they send another amount uh announcement this morning it's about the traffic so make sure you read it instead of us saying that on YouTube so you know how to keep the traffic flowing and everything moving pretty good after service amen so it's your responsibility to read it and make sure you understand what it's saying if you don't read and you're not on the page so don't mind to see a deacon coming and helping you on the shoulder to remind you that you need to keep moving and make sure the traffic is Flowing pretty good amen amen okay we are in the Minister season so you will see Minister coming back up back and forth so be patient with us on prayer teach us how to pray we already went with part one part two part three so just I'm gonna slow down just a little bit to make sure the brother have a flow of easy traffic and then we will come back again and continue on our teaching on how to pray amen so if you got some emails you got some text messages things that you sent me and I have not responded yet I am super loaded amen there was someone who sent us a message from South Africa and know that you're listening we already responded to your message back but we don't see any response back again so check your email you should see the message coming up by God's grace amen I'm gonna approach a very difficult subject this morning I have to push a break and to open up a door that I have to deal with something and then I will come back again where we are and continue to move forward because if I move forward I don't want you to get ambushed because I know what is around me and what I'm fighting against amen it's very easy for you to be pulling sad or somebody to send you a quote or shoot or or inoculate something just in order to trouble you amen so I'm gonna open that door I try to use four coats and move forward but I can't because the spirit of the Lord keep opening things more and more so I have to listen to the leadership of the holy spirit it's a question that was handled in question and answer before but there are several people that were not there and then as a moving question begin to pop up again so make sure when we have question and answer I'm encouraging you as a pastor make sure you're there because when you're missing I'm moving up with a lot of questions and then when we are right in the middle of a fight you begin to ask me question again of things that have been already dealt with in the past it's like you are slowing us from moving forward so make sure you are there the last time we dealt with a question about Elijah you remember that about the spirit of Elijah says the man Elijah coming back up again and then when they ask him in question and answer he say it might be the anointing of Elijah upon man these are questions that have trouble people all around the message for years so when I'm dealing with them I'm putting them together and the day I'm going to preach the seals one of you will come up again with the same question and say brother Stephen look at this brother but I'm saying in other words you're making me work double So to avoid working double whenever we set up a time also give God the preeminence take whatever you have a little bit Assad let's come sit and talk and deal with subject and we move forward when you don't it's gonna be on your responsibility but this time I felt led by God that I have to handle this because somebody need to get free amen so I'm gonna ask you a favor let me download whatever I need to download until I finish it it's very easy for this to go from part one to part two but give me some Grace let me download what I have to download let me deliver what I have to deliver amen if you feel like you're trying to sleep or you tired just stand even beside the wall I'm fine but let me handle what I have to handle we promise everybody's okay with it everybody's comfortable with it Vada Kelly you heard them right amen glory to God so make sure we stay in tune and uh everything will be okay by the grace of God Amen and once we finish this if there is time go back home again before you ask any question go back home sit down and listen again often to what I'm gonna deliver amen there is several quotes that I Contin that I can begin to download more but I stay with the one after this hill so we can move forward because if I go before the sales I will load you with all you will be overloaded amen so I choose the one after the seal so we can move forward quickly but before you ask any question I'm expecting you to ask me questions but before you ask any question please go home sit down review this over open your Bible open the scripture review this over review this one two or three times and pray when you're listening to it because this is a dangerous things that have been a problem for the message all the years that this message was delivered okay we good ready let's go to our scripture if you didn't understand something don't call somebody and begin to talk call me okay call who you know my number call me proverb chapter 1 verse 23. we're still on the faces of roof but this is something it's a door that I have to open to make sure we there so my brother my sister whoever is missing who's not here this morning because you travel or something whenever you come back make sure you listen to this because I'm gonna lay this Foundation one time for this church and I move forward if you have any question I'll tell you you go back and listen to the sermon amen proverb chapter 1 verse 23 if you dare you can say Amen glory to God you should be happy you had the chance to dance to express your joy when I'm there in the office and I wish I was even here myself enjoying the wonderful song of Zion and the music that we get amen praise be to the name of the Lord great job musician I believe I got everything working pretty good Hallelujah Proverbs 1 verse 23 the Bible says turn you at Maori proof in other words my correction behold I will pour out my spirit to you I will make known my words to you you might be seated according to what Solomon is saying here Solomon says that God is giving us a promise and his promise is that he will pour His Spirit upon us amen and that pouring of the spirit Solomon continued he says I will pour my spirit to you I will make known my words to you so the coming of this Spirit upon you everybody okay goes with the making known of the words in other words the revelation of the word I will pour my spirit upon you and then I will make known I will reveal amen reveal what my words unto you amen so they are pouring of the spirit is coupled together with the revelation are we together I hope when I says this I didn't shake you somewhere amen let's go to Isaiah 44 verse 3. glory to God if you dare you can say Amen proverb give us a promise in the Old Testament God promised to pour His Spirit upon us amen and he will make his word known unto us so when the Holy Spirit come upon you there should be a making known a revelation of the word unto you so please do the best that you can and make sure before you leave this church your computer have been downloaded properly I'm speaking common language today not that we are computer but you know what I'm saying Isaiah 44 verse 3 if you dare you can say Amen for I will do what my friend poor water I will pour water upon him that is how thirsty so if you're not thirsty do you expect water to come down so if you want what they're done what happened because tests have a mystery yeah test doesn't mean you don't have water when you're testing for water it doesn't mean you don't have water everybody okay if I take something that looks like a recipient amen and it's calibrated somehow amen and at the beginning this recipient was filled or this job whatever you want to call it was filled with water amen as long as there is water here filled all the way to the top test will never appear everybody okay but if your water begin to go down as it goes down there is a threshold I'm preaching the message just now there is a threshold amen and this threshold is a limit your car have it when your gasoline are going down there is a certain level when your car will give you a signal your car doesn't do your car doesn't give you signal when there is no more gas can I can you say Amen your car gives you signal when your gasoline reach a certain level it doesn't mean the gasoline is completely out the gasoline is still there but the gasoline have Rich air treacherous level everybody okay then the red light comes on telling you that hey you need to get gasoline you still have gasoline [Music] everybody good so when you reach this threshold here when this water Reach This threshold here amen it will trigger the mystery of tests amen amen it will trigger the mystery of thirst amen the mystery of thirst is what this word right here amen create what we call a deep everybody okay and there is now emptiness that is right here amen and this deep here will begin to come [Applause] to another deep and there should be another dip somewhere to respond to that deeper [Applause] so when you are testing for water it doesn't mean you don't have water when you are testing for water it means you got water but in a insufficient level that can cause you trouble let me pull this if you testing for the Holy Ghost foreign [Applause] [Applause] [Music] let me start it again when the gasoline comes up it tells you there's still gasoline but they need more gasoline so when the engine tell you you need gasoline it means you already have gasoline but you need another gasoline to fill you you need a Feeling you need a feeling of the gasoline the feeling of the gasoline means they're already gasoline there what you're getting is a Feeling is a baptism of gasoline [Applause] everybody okay so when you testing for water inside of you there is water in your body because if you take all water out you drop down the water is there but you need more water to be added that is the mystery of thirst test means you already have it but your body is calling for the feeling when this measure come in you have been filled with the Holy Ghost when you're gonna review you will understand me let's go to verse three for our poor water upon him that is half thirsty so when you thirsty means what happened in you there is water that's why they're trying to bring water with the water and the water that is in you and the water that is outside of you they are the same when you put that water in you you cannot make a difference [Music] Lord Jesus if you will get this quickly I will move quickly for our pour out water I will pour water upon him that is thirsty and floods upon the Water dry ground I will pour my spirit upon your water [Music] is a seed dead is a seed evident what is in the seed so why are we pouring life on life [Applause] why are we pouring life on life ah yeah yeah the seed has life and the spirit is also life amen and God say I will pour my spirit upon what upon water so not really you [Applause] if you understand what I preach today your whole life in the message is finished everybody okay so they're not really pouring the spirit on you but they are pouring the spirit on you you remember that right they're not pouring the spirit on you but on you amen because if they pour the spirit on you you can go as a Pentecostal but if they pour the spirit on you not this to you but they knew that is inside [Applause] that's where God targeted because it's the spirit because in the new there is also life [Applause] when I'm doing this it's the anointing getting me like that okay I have to shake sometime okay glory to God we say and the flood upon the dragon I will pour my spirit upon your water [Music] descendant and my blessing upon your water offering so the blessing come after the spirit has been poured we just went through that first they have to pour their Spirit then the blessing the order won't change the poor the spirit after the spirit has been poorer then what followed as your soul we clear we clear let's go to Matthew 13. glory to God if you're there you can say Amen father help me you there you need to keep your Bible please Hallelujah Matthew 13 verse 15. you there for this people's heart is how wax grows and their ears are dull of water and the eyes they have water closed so there are three parts today we are dealing with the heart amen then God is talking about the eyes and the ears amen one two three follow me carefully the Bible says the heart get trouble the ears trouble their eyes trouble so they got trouble in three area everybody okay let me put this in order because somebody would say they say ears first Years first then eyes just the way the scripture put it amen for this people's heart is what's gross and their ears are dull of hearing it's a problem and the eyes they have done what clothes lest at any time they should do what with water their eyes their eyes they should see continue my friend and what here with their ears there is a hearing here and what and should understand with their hearts so they are so the understanding is in the heart how do you understand with the heart I thought we understand with the brain understand with the water what happened if you see with your eyes you hear with your ears and then you understand with your heart amen what happened if those three things are coupled together if one if three is activated two activated one activated what is the result we okay he says and here with the ears and should understand with their heart Karma and should be how so to get converted you need what to be converted in other words to be born again you need to have your ear your eyes open your ears open and your heart understand with their heart and should be how and I should do it so healing and conversion are a package [Applause] I mean it's also what happened to the healing of the body is also for the water I want you to prosper and to be in good as your soul we okay we good have I lost anyone good job to verse 16. but watch now Jesus gave the formula if you want to be converted you need three things amen you need your eyes need to see your ears need to heal and the main thing is your heart need to water remember Solomon say he will pour your spirit upon you and make you know his word we okay verse 16 but blessed are what your eyes stop how many part do we have here three the eyes I'm checking this up everybody okay so the disciple are on the good Direction but we still have to see all three everybody good blessed are your water for the water and your water for the water did you see Jesus touching the heart no so the disciple fulfill number three the fulfill number two but they never Jesus never say your heart have understood because if your heart understand the disciple should have been converted [Applause] in other words if the heart of the disciple were already understanding the Holy Spirit should have entered the disciple so Jesus knew they don't have the Holy Ghost yet that's why Jesus pushed the break and say three you gather two you gather but the day of Pentecost is not yet [Applause] this side is on fire are you on fire on this side are you on fire we okay listen to John here chapter 7 in the last day that great day of the feast the Feast of Tabernacle Jesus stood in Christ saying if any man do it remember Old Testament let him do whatever he that belief is on me as the scripture has said out of his water which barely this one that we put McDonough out of his water shall flow water rivers of Living Water but this whatever he speaks this Becky of the water which day that believe on him should receive for the water Holy Ghost was water because Jesus was not yet water glorified Jesus have not received the glorified body yet no Holy Ghost that's why Jesus never say your heart have understood [Applause] but wait on the day of Pentecost say Jerusalem wait for the holy spirit because when the Holy Spirit will come then the missing part here will understand [Music] everybody good you ready to take off let me do this and as the engine of the airplane is kicking up Amen brother Branham saying now how can I tell you these things which are see I want to preach one of these nights on water counterbalance man could tell you something and just keep building like that but if the end no scripture to do what he will finally water fall down if the desert if this discernment and this vision and things that I have told you about if there had not been the truth first thing there is a water a Bible that is doing water to back it up and who there was the Holy Spirit to prove that I have told you what the truth the message your brother Branham is perfectly in line with the scripture amen everything brother Branham spoke is backed up by the word of God so it's up to the preacher to know how to balance the two together take the scripture and the message and put them together because the message won't contradict the Bible and the Bible won't contradict the message because the message in the Bible are one [Applause] right amen let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we are approaching you humbly this morning Father once again thanking you for your grace your love and your mercy and for everything you have been doing for us father we are committing this service unto the hand Lord may you be merciful to us and move us completely out of the way may you come Lord and handle this service yourself and handle this subject yourself as you always do father in the name of Jesus Christ amen my subject this morning he set the record upon the evidence of the water we want to set the record straight [Music] because we went to so many conventions we went to so many meetings and we have been told that you must receive the Holy Spirit now how do we know we got the Holy Ghost what is the evidence that we got the Holy Ghost it has been a struggle all along the years in the message and everybody put their own interpretation based on the denomination they came out [Applause] everybody okay I'm not saying we don't have the Holy Ghost in this message the true Holy Ghost is in the message but there is a mixed multitude that traveled the campus [Applause] until does that came from Pentecostal that describe the holy ghost in a Pentecostal way and those that came out of the Presbyterian are using the Presbyterian measurement and those that came out from the Baptist are using the Baptist measurement how do we know we got the Holy Ghost this one said it is this way this one said it is this way this one said it is this way how do we know we got the Holy Ghost oh yeah how do we know brother pranam says this I believe this what do you believe brother Brown let's go brother Benjamin that out of water in many of those great fine churches tonight great water denominational churches people who has not yet received the water Holy Spirit how many people but I believe that way in their heart many of them has a warm feeling toward who and Desiring the water you know the main thing is with our water it is not the water that is hindering it is the way it is how presented sometimes if we can present it right in the power and the water man will be glad to do whatever amen [Applause] where are you coming from with this in the midst of roof last Sunday we were talking about the couple Sunday before we were in roof dealing with roof in the holiest in the last phase of roof where roof is preparing for the union with Boaz which is roof rewarding roof preparing to take off for the rapture everybody okay and I mentioned a quote that brother Branham used in reference to the love of God because according to Jesus they asked Jesus a question they say what are the great Commandments you remember Capo San Diego Jesus said You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart we follow your soul we follow your man and you shall love your neighbor as water and John put those two Commandments together and say there is no way you can love God who you don't see if you cannot love your brother who you see in other words that love goes together I will handle that mystery maybe next Sunday Lord dwelling everybody okay amen so we found out that in order to have that love that God was talking about you must have the Holy Ghost because it's the holy ghost that will bring the love of God in your heart amen and by the court of brother Branham the court that was dealing with the two Commandments is what I used couple weeks ago on that quote brother Branham says this [Applause] brother Barnum said that love one another this is we are this will all men know you are my disciple when you get water love one for the other this is when all men will know that you are mine disciple got love one for water the other and brother Branham said that is the water greatest evidence of the Holy Ghost that are not of when you can love water one another yes sir that is the Great Water great water so I took the great commandment and coupled this court in 1961 to show that in order to fulfill the great commandment of God that that Jesus spoke of to love God and to love your neighbor you need to have the Holy Ghost because when the Holy Ghost come he brings the bond of perfection you remember that now somebody got caught right here and reminded me on this and I thought he was the Holy Spirit brother Barnum said that is the great evidence of the water goes so what is the problem with great evidence let's go to Hebrew chapter one if you dare you can say amen amen glory to God you there first one the Bible says God whoever and in water diverse manners spoke in past by the water and to the father by The Who Prophet God didn't speak one way when God spoke to Israel God was not using one way God spoke to Israel in diverse manner in other words in various ways in other words if you look at the way God spoke to Abraham it's not going to be the same way he spoke to Noah foreign so if you take your experience and you put it on Abraham when Noah will bring his experience you won't miss God everybody okay everybody together so the way God spoke to Abraham is different than the way he dealt with Joseph the way he dealt with Joseph it is different than the way he dealt with Ezekiel the way he dealt with Ezekiel is different than the way he dealt with Isaiah but he was God in Isaiah God in Abraham God in Moses God is Ezekiel but God spoke in various ways so those that came under the ministry of Ezekiel if you ask them how do God speak they will always tell you what God did with Ezekiel but they will miss God in Abraham and those that were in Abraham will miss God in Joseph and those that were in Joseph will miss God in Moses and those is Moses will misguard in Jeremiah because God spoke to us in various way through the prophet [Applause] in other words in the Old Testament you cannot pin God in one spot [Applause] you cannot look at the Old Testament and say God is Abraham because God will show you his color in Joseph if you say it's Joseph he shows David if you say it's David he shows Isaiah if you say Isaiah he shows Ezekiel if you say Ezekiel he shows Malachi so it's hard to pinpoint God [Applause] [Music] [Applause] because God in diverse manner in various ways spoke to Our Father by water now we got a problem if you ask somebody in the Old Testament how do God Speak some will tell you it's Isaiah some will tell you to Jeremiah some will tell you it's one of the prophet amen but how do we where can we have something fixed that we can say now we got something that contains Isaiah [Applause] [Applause] take Moses take Jacob take Abraham take whoever it is mix them together give me one person [Applause] we Okay we okay Mama let's keep calming verse 2. has in this water today verse two has he knew this water last day done water spoken unto us by who his son no more prophet [Music] no more a prophet but be prophet [Applause] God In Time passed was using a prophet but in this last day he's using the prophet [Applause] he was using sons of man but now he's using this son of man [Applause] in the back way okay I'm checking your temperature back there glory to God everybody okay he say has in this life they spoke to us by what his son whom he has appointed water air of water so if you wanna find all things [Applause] that God is you need to find the air you need to find the Sun because the sun got everything of God the son got the fullness of the godhead badly amen [Applause] [Music] let's go to John chapter 3. help me please to avoid part two let's go to John chapter 2 3. if you dare you can say Amen I'm giving you some time make sure you waited please John 3 verse 28. if you dare you can say amen amen is my voice okay because sometimes I climb up so I'm not yelling at anybody okay okay yeah I have to recalibrate things sometimes okay yeah it's a language amen 28 you there let's go my friend you yourself bear me witness that I say I am not who the Christ that's John the Baptist but I am sent before who hidah has the bread is the bridegroom but the friend of the Bride which stand and hear with him which is John the Baptist amen re Joseph greatly because of the whose voice let's leave that alone this my joy therefore is how in other words they ask John the Baptist are you the Messiah are you the crust are you that person that we want to put our finger ready and say this is they this is God because when we want to worship Abraham Abraham saying that's right amen we look at uh Daniel we said Daniel this must be God we want to go there and say keep moving forward I'm just pointing you let's go forward so there's so John the Baptist they say Ah that's you tell us the truth is it you John say it's not me I am just saying to for running we there we there watch first study he must do water increase but how much how he must increase amen job 2 verse 34. to save time for he whom God has sent speak the water the words of God for God gives not the water spirit by water measure to who so this son that John the Baptist introduced his anointing have no measure [Music] amen Joseph you can measure him because God only show a color Abraham God only demonstrated something Daniel God demonstrated something but this one if you looking for demonstration you don't know where to go because he is the fullness of everything everybody good listen to brother Branham glory to God in the message now I'm in 64. that was 61. I'm now after the seals now you see when the man was anointed like who Joseph he portrayed who your microphone working good when Moses was how anointed he portrayed who Christ when David was he portrayed him Christ all leading up to who Christ and he was the fullness of the water the world was made manifested where he was the Complete Water anointed one they had it by how we have it by how but he wants water the anointed one so before Jesus Christ you can point anyone to portions and All Those portions are God [Applause] everybody okay everybody okay because all of them died and they went into Paradise you're following me and they stuck right there amen Jesus also died and Jesus dropped down to Paradise Jesus never dropped to Paradise as a man [Applause] Jesus was the world made in the beginning was what and the Word was with her and the Word was made Jesus was Melchizedek made flesh Amen in other words if you cut the Flesh of Jesus Christ and you open him on the east side you will see melchized amen do you follow me but when Jesus died the body of Jesus Christ the Flesh of Jesus Christ Jesus Took the Flesh and lifted at the tomb so did Jesus that went into Paradise is not the man Jesus Christ but the word that worked with the prophet the man Jesus Christ didn't meet Abraham foreign Jesus Christ that was born from Mary never meet Joseph the man Jesus Christ that was born out of Mary never met Daniel he was the Jesus in the Jesus [Applause] everybody okay that was the Jesus of the Autumn that Jesus met Abraham that Jesus met Daniel that Jesus met Jacob that Jesus met a Malachi or the prophet but when he come to the order to the New Testament that Jesus prepare himself a body do you follow me and Jesus entered on the inside and closed the body and I know so when they ask him who are you he said I am and when they look at him they say but this one came from Mary amen so the veil was causing the trouble [Applause] when he looked at them he said wait a minute you know Abraham before Abraham was I was there they look at him they say wait a minute you're not even 50 years old you say you've seen Abraham the man didn't see Abraham but the one that was in Islam was the one with Abraham [Applause] everybody okay amen so in order to go to paradise if the man goes to Paradise Abraham don't remember him [Applause] because Abraham never met Jesus in the body Jacob never met Jesus in the body they met Jesus as the word that's why when he goes to Paradise he have to go in his day off honey Amen in the word and when he opened the door brother Branham say everybody was looking at him the way he met them in the Old Testament [Applause] everything [Music] [Applause] in other words if you put Jesus right here in Paradise amen I'm giving an illustration when Abraham look he sees the same thing that you see but when Abraham spoke he said hey Sarah come here you remember the man that came in now in uh in Genesis 18. the one that came that you cook food you remember him that's him right there Ezekiel said Abraham let me see he said what are you talking about Abraham this is the wheel in the middle of the wheel [Music] when Daniel came he said move move guys move like he said he said in the lion then this is the man [Applause] everybody good shot drag me they say move move move move they say ah Daniel you remember the fourth man we were talking about this is him right here because he appeared as the word according to the personal experience [Applause] everybody okay everybody okay another word all of them were looking at the same thing but according to their personal experience and each one has their own experience different than another one but still the same God what is the happiness of the Holy Ghost is the Abraham is it Joseph is he is easy yes who has the evidence of the Holy Ghost according to your revelation [Applause] Holy Ghost Abraham shouting God the Holy Ghost [Applause] can I continue Mama we're good let me change please my friend Amanda listen to brother Branham glory to God therefore after who the water we cannot point to water something else in other words in the Old Testament Daniel can speak Abraham can speak Jacob can speak all of them can speak according to their experience but when Jesus came amen Jesus Took Abraham and put him there took Jacob and put him there took Daniel and put him there Jesus meets all of them together and produce one revelation that's why brother Branham say when Jesus come you can no longer point to Jacob [Applause] everybody okay because the fullness is there before Jesus you can point to anybody but when Jesus come there is no one else you can point to you only have one person now you can point to if they say who is God no longer Abraham no longer Jacob God is one person is Jesus Christ everybody okay [Applause] [Music] let's go brother Branham say he points back to who him him the what the word not the man the word because the word is what gives you experience amen and brother Brahman pick up water his Bible this is the Complete Water Revelation the Bible nothing can be or whatever taken away this is a complete water Revelation all that a shadow of him to come but when he come he was the water perfect everybody portion but when he come he's the fullness he's the complete in other words now if you ask me how does God a talk look at Jesus don't look at David look at Jesus how does God laugh look at Jesus how does God react look at Jesus how does God live look at Jesus how do God eat look at Jesus everything you want to know about God you have a farmer absolute point you have the stature of a perfect man [Applause] in other words whatever Holy Ghost you have must match up with Jesus Christ if your Holy Ghost doesn't line up with Jesus Christ your Holy Ghost God problem because after the prophet we can only point to one person [Applause] him who the word how do you know what is the evidence show me your life and let me look at that man if I look at Jesus Christ and you and Jesus you are reflecting you get what Jesus said [Music] foreign [Applause] oh my God oh my God what is the devil looking at this time he won't work my friend amen glory to God Amen brother Branham say what he said God in Central Time spoke to the father through the water God spoke through water well the first but in this last day through his water Jesus Christ there you are I'm very well that is the point the final point of reference of everything now is the Lord Jesus Christ amen why is this evidence a problem why do we have to handle this evidence why do we have to put a record straight on this evidence what is going on you ready now all righty brother Branham says this glory to God please follow me let me download this USB it's big Amen brother Branham say in 19 water after the seals he says what is the fruit of the spirit it is what love and water joy and water peace and water and water gentleness and water goodness fruit of the water spirit many people do water rely upon that all the time it is the devil sometimes we're trying to set the record straight everybody okay brother Branham say how many times sometimes that is he can do whatever to the water push your brick [Music] you ready you ready you ready impersonation is not original [Applause] [Music] let me drop it again to impersonate something doesn't know eradicate the original [Applause] that's it the devil doesn't create love but he can impersonate love so when it is impersonate even though it look like it but it's not the original when you have a bogus dollar amen it looked like a real dollar that's why he can deceive but it's still not the original amen so if you have a bogus dollar it doesn't make the original dollar wrong why are you saying this because we have meteorated they're working off the holy spirit in this message until people who have the Holy Ghost are afraid to express the Fruit of the Spirit [Applause] because all we hear is speaking in tongue is wrong speaking in tongue is wrong as any appersonation but there is a genuine speaking in town [Applause] to impersonate his what what has to impersonate me huh to impersonate he means to pretend it means to mimic it means to imitate in the purpose of a show an entertainment or in the purpose to deceive amen so when something is impersonated it is no longer an original because God is the only one that can create there is only two sources the First Source is God and the other source is the devil amen God have the original and God can create they therefore only impersonate amen or he perverts amen but that perversion doesn't remove the original it doesn't discredit The Originals man the fact is truth and the original [Applause] amen everybody okay everybody okay so brother Branham is saying here he says that sometimes that is what the devil if it's the devil is that the love of the Holy Spirit or the love of the impersonation if the devil produces a capital you gave the devil for the Holy Ghost so we need to know what we're talking about because we got true love [Applause] amen and brother Branham added two more and we end up with four you remember the hotel we got a couple of we got feel your love and brother Branham said there was a lustful of and the fifth love amen amen if the devil want to produce a love do you think he's going to produce a capital agape love can only come from God because God is love [Applause] so the impersonation of the devil is not actually the real thing cannot continue glory to God brother Branham say he can impersonate water why is he impersonating it because the original speaking in tongue came on the day of Pentecost now that the original has been released he can look at the original and manufacture it but it doesn't remove the original amen he said to the water interpretation of it to the water any of those gifts he can do whatever impersonating um or Along come the water body brand I'm saying it's a great dark Arrow and said it is water the water fruit of the spirit many of them shows what the fruit of the spirit and don't water heavy what kind of fruit of the Spirit original or impersonated impersonator I know why I'm saying that because we always say they can they can produce the fruit of the spirit like they have the Holy Ghost and the Holy Ghost is producing the Fruit of the Spirit Amen brother Branham said those Pharisees could show how the fruit the water Jesus could [Applause] who had the original who had the fullness of the Holy Ghost Jesus when Jesus had the fullness who had the Holy Ghost even John the Baptist said God asked him was it the true one in other words everything that was existed Jesus pulled everything and put it in himself no one have the Holy Ghost that's why he said it's expedient for me to go because as long as I'm here none of you get it I got the whole thing amen if he got the Holy Ghost the fullness well where did the Pharisee get the fruit [Applause] did they get the fruit from the Holy Ghost because the Holy Ghost was not given yet so which fruit were they coming from you need to know how you handling brother you need to know how you're using this message I'm sorry I'm using this but I know what I'm talking about I can use it to the camera you need to know how to hand the brother brother amen because no one had the Holy Ghost beside Jesus Christ but the Pharisee produced 10 times [Applause] what they produce brother Branham said the word Pharisee means an actor so they produced by impersonating in other words what they show to be love the day you're gonna come in contact with them and you begin to live closer to them you will realize that it was not love [Applause] he was a manufacturer love amen [Applause] are we good are we good this is why brother Branham is saying it is not the fruit of the spirit because the Holy Ghost brings love but they can impersonate it so brother Branham doesn't want you to put your hand today because they're gonna produce that and you'll be confused and tomorrow the brother that you thought was a brother will bite you and when you look at the bite it looks like the thief of a wolf [Applause] and you want the hack and a sheep bite like a wolf he was a wolf in sheep clothing [Applause] you the one that gave him the Holy Ghost because of his expression of love [Applause] [Music] we Okay we okay we're good we're good we're good in the back brother Branham says this that is not 64. that is what no everything off the water Holy Ghost you can rely upon that you can rely upon the water fruit of the spirit because the first fruit of the spirit is what and the Christian Science exercises more love than water anybody I know of and then even deny who Jesus Christ please let me handle this subject to my friend brother Brandon is saying something here before we move on because in the message we read quote and we just close and we go this is a Prophet this is a Vindicated Prophet you need to slow down and pray to understand what is the prophet saying brother Branham is saying here that the Christian Science shows more love but they are denying Jesus to be divine in other words their love amen is contrary to the word a love that contradicts the word is not a genuine love [Applause] it is an impersonation of love it is a profession of love and it doesn't I know the genuine love of God everybody okay everybody okay put your seat belt because I'm gonna uh Dodge an asteroid okay okay we somewhere in the universe brother Branham says this he said there is only one evidence of the water Holy Spirit and that is a water a genuine thing in the water promise word of the water push the breaker we want to set the record push the brake you ready brother Branham say the evidence that he's picking off amen is a genuine what not faith but how [Applause] not space but why the word genuine [Applause] [Music] [Applause] genuine what's up because there is two faith [Applause] you remember that we said that's why I love my body amen there is a word intellectual faith and there is a water a genuine faith man brother Branham say the proof that you got the Holy Ghost you must have a water why this word genuine everybody okay why this word genuine are you there are you there let's go to James chapter two here come and ask her again and I'm gonna Dodge it quickly if you dare you can say a man James chapter 2. please have your Bible amen whoever brought up the court God bless you because now we're gonna set this down amen James chapter to you there you can say Amen verse 19. are you there amen follow me carefully amen amen let's go you believe that water there is one God how many here believe that there is one God his name is Hope Jesus Christ We Believe on the Supreme deity of the Lord Jesus Christ because in him do I left the fullness of the godhead how in the beginning was the word the word was with and the Word was God we clear James said you believe that you believe that there is one God Amen you are doing what wow can I continue can I continue the who devil the devil daughter also believe and they do artists everybody okay now everybody okay now so which Faith do the devil have if they believe why are not the dev forgetting the baptism of the Holy Ghost [Music] s because brother but I'm saying You must have her a genuine what because a devil can believe but is that Faith genuine [Music] up in John chapter 6. according to James who else can believe the devil not The Devil Himself devils amen when we say devil most of the time we look in that Spirit like a flooding something like a ghost coming that's a devil let's look at the Devil a little bit different are you there are you there go to John chapter 6 verse 70. if you dare you can say Amen verse 70. 77 0. amen you there Jesus answered them and say what have I now chosen you twelve stop he's talking about who the disciple where the spirit they were water continue let's start again have I not have not I what chosen chosen you watch it well continue my friend and what one of you is a devil is my Bible different than yours so the devil now is how it is in skin now thank you my brother amen he's in skin now amen let's continue we want to know who's that devil don't take my word we have to know who is that Jesus said one of you the disciple one of you is the devil we need to know who is it verse 30 verse 71 let's go he spoke of who Judas is scarier the son of who Simon for he was for he he was that should water betray him being one of the waters wow so Judas was a devil [Applause] yes okay the Judas cast our devils [Applause] did you just pray for the sick and they got here did you see Jews at in the upper room the devil belief but what kind of belief what can the faith did Judah have because Judah was justified and Sanctified he only missed the Holy Ghost did he have that's why brother Branham saying You must have a what kind of person imagine what there is two sort of Heaven [Applause] there is two sort of love there is two sources okay listen to brother Branham if who in 1965 after the seals if Judas was the water see off the water the enemy and the water discrepancy he also become and dwell Among Us in the person of water Judas is scary he never had no real water real pain he had what he thought was there is such a thing as Heaven a water and a make-believe baby and a genuine Faith Of God will do it believe in God and God is the water and he shall never take away one our path will be water taken from The Book of Life in revelation 22 now when we go back the proof that you have the genuine Holy Ghost brother Brian I'm saying is to have genuine not Faith genuine because you can have faith like a devil you can have faith like a Judah you can have a make-believe Faith or intellectual faith [Applause] and that intellectual faith of Judah could pray for the sick and they get healed was that the Holy Ghost can I continue can I continue is there any here that has not received the baptism of the spirit yet and you say brother Brian I'mma tell you I shouted one time that is very good I spoke in tongue once that is very good but still that ain't what I'm not talking about how can you shout and speak what and what deny the word do you see push the brick I'm gonna handle what is believing and what is receiving believe amen you already understood what kind of faith we have and receive amen but the devil belief [Applause] so they therefore God the Holy Ghost amen amen the devil believe one God just like you does he have the Holy Ghost do you see now because William Marion Branham preached the deity of Jesus Christ and the devil also believed the deity of Jesus Christ is he your brother can I continue those priests had Jesus what beat a million miles when he comes to the water how gentle and water and water and water Jesus was the one that was whipping people the pastor whipping people that's a bad pastor a pastor should be gentle Jesus was a pastor but he was a pastor that took and whooped the people but they are the person never the people they were so gentle and good that's what people like in this message [Applause] his son rude look at the way he took look at the way he's look at his gesture on the pulpit he's acting like he's the big shot we want God richly bless you are you good my friend God loves you are we still alive I ask you to give me Grace right I'm not wanting anyone I'm pointing the word so don't come after and say oh it was me ah okay I'm just reading the Bible okay okay you're my weakness okay yeah can I continue cannot continue can I continue we're talking about believing in water brother Branham says this in which year my friend 64 after the seals brother Branham said today I was talking with a good friend Dr living who is present now he's quite a theologian and so we usually have some pretty water good discussion not nasty discussion good discussion about water the scripture very water he asked me one time what I thought about the initial evidence of the water Holy Ghost was he speaking in tongue I have been many years it has been many years I said no I can't see that he said neither do I say though I have been taught that he said what would you think about being the evidence he said I said the most perfect evidence I can fake is what love we okay follow me carefully he said and so we got to talking on that and then I thought that sounded pretty good so I just held on that if a man has got what love but what one day the Lord in the water did water slow down okay just stay with me okay I'm gonna take you in a higher uh you're gonna feel the the the the spaceship going again higher okay now and he said that the evidence of the Holy Ghost was for those who could do what we need to Define what is received away we need to Define that I know why okay need the water love no water but receiving water and then Dr Phil was saying to me that that is water scripture because in John 14 Jesus said we'll continue when he the Holy Ghost has come upon you he will reveal these things I'll show you things to come so there is there is

First Corinthians 13 verse 2. and though I have the water give those prophecy let's leave it alone and do water understand all Mysteries push the break they say a clear understanding you got the Holy Ghost Paul is saying even though I got the understanding of all Mysteries remember the message doesn't contradict the Bible and the Bible doesn't contradict the message so who contradicted us can I

hearing how [Music] okay [Music] which Year my friend after this Hills he says we are hearing the message that God gave us and seeing the son that he showed us and prove it by the Bible it is there but oh how much the church need to do what lay is his presence where is this presence in the Tabernacle until we do at him you know and get water sweet in the spirit so that we can he can do whatever everybody okay everybody good I'm gonna move the ship again too many asteroids my friend so you need to keep your seatbelt can I continue he said now we have been constantly saying that the true evidence of being baptized with what the Holy Ghost is for the believer to do what receive words of water for the age in which there he lives what does it mean to receive the word what does he mean you ready you ready are we ready [Applause] remember that we got three wings you remember that you remember this you remember this and then you remember this okay okay this is the seed and in the seed where is what is it which life because this seed comes from another civilization which life is there is it the temporal life it's what kind of life eternal life everybody okay this is your soul and this is your spirit and this one is your body we clear heaven in second Thessalonians the Bible says that and with all water you see disease why do they perish why do they perish because they receive not the love of the truth stuff what is the truth the truth is Jesus Christ which is the huh the truth is the word which is Christ I am the truth the Lord life and way amen so Paul is saying that people are perishing they don't get saved why because they have never received what are true so for you to be saved for you to receive water you must have water [Applause] [Music] for you to fill the tank there must be some gasoline can I continue for you to have life you must also have eternal life already [Applause] can I continue now Paul is saying that the reason why you are saved is because you have the love of the truth in other words in your seed here the eternal the eternal life that is there is already giving you the love of God foreign ER when you do something something struck you but you don't know God yet but you are sad because something is new is already God [Applause] and love God and hate the devil [Music] cannot continue and he says the love of the truth that they may be have so to be saved you must have love of the truth the truth which is the word now for this cause God sent them water strong delusion that they should believe what because there is no love there in other words you are immune to believe a life when the light comes something in you don't click even as bogus as he can be but still you will feel like I don't know he's a good brother I won't put my hand let's keep praying and see after 20 years he shows his color you say I know it I know it I always felt something was fishy about him who was feeling something fishy can I continue cannot continue he says that they are my behalf damn who believe not in the water truth but had pleasure in water unrighteous weak but we are how to do what who [Music] chosen you towards salvation through the water of the spirit and water so you already have faith but your face was laying down everybody okay [Applause] can I continue we try to know what happened follow me carefully Amen brother brother I'm saying Blasphemous name first fundamentally uh foundationally is what second add to your faith what virtue to your virtue water from knowledge water from Temperance word patience some patience what from godliness World Brotherly Love brotherly kindness and then what big water seven of those water so the Capstone is what love and the Capstone is this message [Applause] [Music] everybody okay everybody okay the Capstone is the message of William Mayon Branham and the Capstone is what love and love is God and God is the word [Applause] everybody okay and what do you have in the predestinated seed why do you have love can I continue brother Branham says here remember my message here the opening of what that Capstone where does water seven voices that is not wrote in there so the message of the seven pandas which is the message that broke up this Hills is the Capstone Ministry that is lost can I continue I'm gonna ship I'm gonna move the ship again we clear which Year my friend after the seals please explain First Corinthians 13 is okay 13. First Corinthians 13 speak about what you speak about what love which is what charity everybody here brother Branham interpret us what does this mean because he is the perfect interpreter as a prophet of the hour we says 13 8-12 now that that perfect word is restored are these verse for fear they ask him a question but when I'm saying now I think I just went through that didn't I and when that which is what perfect has come that which is in part shall be how Paul said do I speak with tongue of men and Angel I do all these things but when that which is water is come in the Bible it's talking about love listen to brother Brown I'm in 624 he says now is there anything perfect but who God because God is water yes no sir is God perfect in the beginning was the word and the Word was with what and the Word was water the word is still God so when that which is perfect is come that which is his part is water so brother Branham replaces the word love with the word [Applause] because the love is also the Capstone the love is the Capstone is the message of William Mayon Branham is the Capstone Revelation in his love so when the message come it is love coming towards love [Applause] it is one day coming toward it it is eternal life coming towards eternal life and when the true love meets together love is the bond of perfectness then you as a seed and God as the Original Seed meets together you are married in an invisible the marriage of the land cannot continue are you too much loaded or do you want me to continue Lord help me amen amen which Year my friend 64. after the field when you are filled with the spirit here is one of the best son I know you are how so in love with Christ and whatever [Music] at the beginning believe the word believe the word believe the word receive the word now brother Branham say you are so in water and then you do water together [Applause] cannot continue cannot continue he develops somebody brother Branham we were talking about believing and what and we found out that what do you receive it is the word coming to the word we already went through that and that word is love in you you have eternal life so when God meet God God meet your God and the two God meet they are compatible [Applause] the two gasoline mixed together and they form bounds together until you cannot separate the two gasoline the Two Become because love is the bond of what perfectness you and God now are united you become one when God move you move when God talk you talk what it is it is the love of Christ and the word that I put together into one in other words if you come and you claim that oh I have the Holy Ghost because I believe this message I need to see the love of God in you [Applause] you need to love the word there are two Holy Ghost will produce the love of the world if you love me you keep the Commandment if you can't keep the message and you run away from the message you didn't have the love of God you didn't have the Holy Ghost God so loved the word that he gave his only one so we need to see Jesus in your life so saying I believe the message is not enough cannot continue [Applause] can I continue listen to brother Branham brother Branham says this he says so you are in love with uh with Christ and believe what that he said to be water that is the water that you have water the Holy Spirit give me some time there is few left so we can lend this ship can I continue listen which Year my friend after this heals how God is what love he that loveth is of what divine Holy Love not dirty love but how and how and how love of who dare the word [Music] you cannot separate love from God you cannot separate love from the word because the Capstone himself is love the very essence of deity is love the word is love [Applause] so if you claim to believe the message and you don't like the message you don't have the Holy Ghost the baptism of the Holy Ghost in this message will make you love the message more than anything [Applause] if you receive the message the message will suck you to him you receive the message the message will receive you because it's love towards love [Applause] it is not an intellectual believing an intellectual receiving but it's an experienced believing an experience receiving [Applause] [Music] we see Theologian in this message they're working out like this Theologian in this message I believe the message I believe the message look how they treat one another look how you treat your wife look how you treat your neighbor and your children look at you they say the way I'm gonna reach a team I'm out of this home because then because they want to believe in the message and receiving the message never display love cannot continue cannot continue which here my friend after this year that is the water evidence of the water the Holy Ghost when God does what reveals to you and you do what how can you accept if you don't have the love of the truth to suck the Holy Ghost you must have the love of the truth to suck love now what you are not what you are what you was or nothing about it it is who what God has done for you now there is the water it is not your believing it believing God is that the word it is not you receiving God it is guarding you receiving God the evidence [Applause] because you can receive it intellectually and they can get some crazy video they have on YouTube and send it to you and tomorrow you don't believe the message anymore because you receive it intellectually you have a Judas faith but let this man receive [Applause] when this man receive usually he doesn't know how to explain because it's an experience ask a woman ask a woman who fall in love with a man that why do you love him she might give you some clue but truly she doesn't know she will tell you maybe if his sister he's just a nice guy it's the best they can give you if it's just let me continue my friend can I continue that was a sense of humor because the airplane is heading down here and I'm searching to get back to Earth so I can search the airport to the United States in Gastonia North Carolina so I can learn this ship okay so put your seat belt as I'm coming down you're gonna feel like an elevator moving down okay okay oh glory to God Roman 10 17. you okay you want me to stop if I stop it's part two let's go so then first cometh by what and hearing by the water the word of God so everybody that heard Williams there are many people that listen to the tape they left you the message so why did they listen to the tape and they didn't receive faith because Faith coming from healing they healed the table they hear the DVD they hear whatever they came to church after 10 years 20 years they left the message why they didn't have faith amen amen galatian water [Music] it's only would I learn from you receive is the Holy Spirit the Spirit by the Water Works of the law the law could not produce them all by the hearing of what not hearing but the hearing of water in other words won't you hear must be coupled with a revelation if not you only hearing noises you're only hearing good sermon but he won't change you [Music] let's continue five he therefore that means Mr to you the water in other words the one who gives you the spirit and work of water and the one do do Miracle among you does it do it by the work of the law or by the water hearing of faith in other words to have the Holy Ghost you must heal not hearing a noise but it's a hearing of faith everybody okay remember you must understand with your heart everybody good get this why Paul said in Hebrew photo for unto us was the Gospel word as well as unto who but the word preached in what now not being mixed with water in them that do what so when the word come to you everybody okay and the word enter you it is not enough amen because the word can get in bus the word when he get in you he must find faith in other words when the faith when the world is coming there must be a goalkeeper that is waiting for the word amen when the word comes the goalkeeper goes and he catches the word then he can break the word down and pull the nutrient of the word he can digest the word and pull the nutrient of the world so does nutrient can be incorporated in your system and you begin to grow foreign [Applause] that will happen to the people that left this message that's what happened to a lot of young people in this message because they don't know they are confused [Music] cannot continue can I continue bear with me my friend let me change gear speed if Gastonia North Carolina let me increase the speed please so we can go to the airport amen amen that's why brother Branham say which Year my friend 63 after this year what is the water you say well

started in your soul when your predestinated seed Bland it tells you that don't worry about the remaining you're gonna blend with him in the body you never seen Jesus in the flesh how do you see him in the word amen so the day you will see him you won't be surprised because your revelation will kick in like he did for Daniel [Music] there is a quote on that one where brother Branham said the one you were feeling in your heart you will see him personified before you in other words when you see Jesus you will remember the touch he gave you you will tell yourself oh you're the one that took me that day I remember the day you came and somebody else is saying oh I was dying on a car accident that was you [Music] where in your heart to water word of this age he not the word as the message begin to come that same God begin to break it down for you so when brother Stephen is preaching you're going to hear somebody explaining you again a little bit more and you see it more clearly and what he's explaining you brother Stephen didn't say that but you hear somebody saying remember that scripture he said I got it who is explaining you who is that inside the teacher who is that God that

water [Applause] is your word line up I believe the message oh you believe the message you got the Holy Ghost let's see your life let's see the action let's see the word lining up how many times do you go to church your Holy Ghost keep you away from church your Holy Ghost doesn't want to pray your Holy Ghost doesn't want to read the word oh we believe the message of the hour we receive the message of the hour you are fooling nobody my friend Airport if you are a water if you are truly water with the Holy Ghost you will water instead this word above your necessary me and learn to live by water everywhere what is the evidence of the Holy Spirit [Music] what is the evidence of the Holy Spirit what are you going to point to the Holy Spirit was speaking to him the holy spirit will prophesy the holy spirit will give you Vision the holy spirit will do this will do that the holy spirit will do that but make sure that life is line up with the word of the hour outside of that intellectual knowledge intellectual hearing Pentecostal experience fleshly experienced doctrine of holy ghost or all kind of Holy Ghost we created in this message somebody who doesn't care about the message at all he come to church only one time but he can claim he got the Holy Ghost amen if something happened he will fly like something you never seen the Holy Ghost doesn't know how to push the break on him but he receives the message of the away amen we receive we are in the message of the earth we are where with the life Church you don't fool yourself amen don't fool yourself how do you know you got the Holy Ghost we got the representation the original life came in the Man Called Jesus Christ that life everybody can read it in the Full Gospel you can read what happened to Jesus Christ you must produce that because it's the same life that come back to us amen and he comes using the word the vehicle the word of the hour because the word will awaken you when they awaken you then guarding you they're going to suck the remaining of God so that you can grow amen but don't tell me you don't grow you got the Holy Ghost don't tell me that don't tell me you got the Holy Ghost you only read five books of brother Branham for 20 years don't tell me you got the Holy Ghost because brother Adam said the Holy Spirit feed on the word your word is five books for 20 years so you need 20 more years 40 years then you will you will return your Holy Ghost is starving amen what is the baptism of the Holy Ghost what is the evidence of the Holy Ghost amen when the Holy Ghost come in you amen you will release the love of God when he released the love of God love and love Knocked Up them and then you are hooked when you are hooked your life change your action change whatever you do for God is no more a push it is somebody who's pushing you you don't need Mama anymore you don't need anybody to be with you don't need somebody to put a drone you don't need your husband to be monitoring you where you're going the Holy Ghost is the best monitor amen because you know there is an eye watching you if you do something wrong he said there that was wrong there that was and you turn around you say I'm not one singer no I'm not the same person that I used to be I'm not where I'm supposed to be yet because we don't have the Redemption of the body but I can tell a change you know that somebody's working in your life that is greater than you any question let's stand thank you very much for the sacrifice I have to lay it down like I told you go home go home tonight you can even go take a break and sleep go home review this I loaded amen all our Worth to go through every direction I went is to knock out things that are going on in this message that are confusing the people amen we need to come up to a place where we can rest our soul and know for another child of a doubt that it is I have a quote brother Branham saying he lay hands on the people and when they receive the Holy Ghost they fell like flies in these messages people fail like flies they say it's Pentecostal so your experience don't wait to be matching somebody experience somebody must scream when the Holy Ghost comes somebody will be quiet and tears are coming down somebody will be sitting and fell on the floor somebody will be rolling on the floor because Abraham experience is different than Joseph Joseph experience is different but all together when the Capstone will come to come to pick us up we are with our individual experience like brother Samuel say your work is a individual Pilgrim we will find ourselves suck according to all our different experiences and we're gonna meet the bridegroom and all our experiences will be represented when we see him when we see him your experience will be there my experience will be there because it was God in brother Charles God in Benjamin God in brother so God insisted so and so God insisted so and so it's God in his people God in the bread but in the various way just like he did to the prophet Heavenly Father Lord we are approaching you again humbly this afternoon father we thank you for your grace for your love and for your mercy and for everything you have been dealing for with us Lord father Lord thank you for bringing Lord father this such a hard difficult chapter Lord but father you yourself unfolded where now we

anchored to the soul and we're not laying that on a preacher or a church or anyone but it's a personal experience that happened within our soul and something changes that we are Lord father a new creation Lord may you help those that have not reached it's a very challenging message may you help those that have not reached where they're supposed to reach that you'll be merciful to them may they lay Assad or their agenda everything that they put always before you may they go back in the presence of the god and Lord father cry out and pray with deep sincerity to make sure they are settled and they have entered the rest that you have purpose for your children for the work was done before the foundation of the world Lord appreciate their patience Lord to go an extra mile with me Lord to finish this sermon father may you bless them may you remember them may you strengthen them may father Lord you give them a revelation deeper than even what was spoken we commit it all unto their hand in the name of Jesus Christ give them travel Mercy protect them on the way home in Jesus precious name amen church God bless you we love you all I was trying to do is to set up a record so we know
