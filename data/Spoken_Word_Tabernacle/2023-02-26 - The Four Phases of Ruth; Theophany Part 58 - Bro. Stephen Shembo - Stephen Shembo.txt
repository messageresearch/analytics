praise God Amen brother Seth has one and a small song you want to do it now you want to do it go ahead I can't wait praise the Lord amen um we are all witnesses to the testimony amen um I just want to praise God that my wife is doing well she was not able to make it to church this morning because um there's still some some pain um in her back but I believe it was because of um laying down in bed for like five days in the hospital but I believe um on Wednesday coming the Lord will surely been here to church amen amen I just want to um praise God for what he did at the latter stages when she was in the hospital um it was this nurse that um when they took it out for for a procedure and then she came back she asked that we should pray so when we were praying after the prayer I realized something had changed with a nurse that was taking care of her she realized that we were Christians so when she approached and then we were telling her that the pain had come down she was saying hallelujah and um because we prayed she became confident to to say hallelujah because initially she was not really sure whether they support Christians or not but because we prayed it it drew her closer and then um when I when I left the hospital my wife said that she came closer to her she had a plane um State and she was like I'm also a Christian um which um personally listening to and my wife said he was listening to the prophet William Branham she thought it was Billy Graham and my wife said nah it's not Billy Graham but William Branham and she said well she'll go and listen to it she's going to find out um see who it is but then uh as they were talking my wife was sharing her testimony to her and she was like she told me that she the nurse cried the whole time listening to her testimony and she said that she believes that the Lord brought her to the hospital because of her and whatever she was going through my wife was like um that thing I don't know what she was going through as a nurse but I want to thank God that um we going to the hospital was not just in pain but the Lord had to touch somebody and and I believe one of these days the Lord will lead her to church amen amen amen amen uh sorry we couldn't get her name but I believe the Lord shall lead her to church amen amen so um as my wife shared that with me this song just dropped to me and it was just a simple song I just want to sing it amen amen praise the Lord amen so he said it Is Well with My Soul It Is Well with My Body it is what my spirit amen It is Well when my soul It is Well it Is Well

[Applause] [Music] [Applause] amen let's continue to remember um sister a coach amen and to give our brother strength as well but God is truly with them amen praise the lord we want to remember brother Lamont as well he had to go in this morning to the Urgent Care because of some pretty bad back pain amen so um I want to bring up one more little thing I know it might be redundant did it I sent a video this this week my wife went out and was singing to the cows the little calves they're this big she was singing born born again and when she got to that part they said I'm gonna see my Jesus that little cow started running around and kicking and running around having a little Revival in the pen and the reason I keep bringing this up about these cows is it's just a cow it's only a cow he's a month old the two of them they're only this big it's kind of like the sparrow that the Bible refers to he he's mindful of that little Sparrow he's Mindful and even causes rejoicing in a little calf's heart so when we have problems like coats or brother Lamont nothing for God because we are children of God it's just a cow let's stand amen brother would you like to come up and lead us in prayer this morning you like to do that remember remember our brothers you don't have to remember the cows they're fine now okay they're healed really quick church it's okay God bless you and good

get back into a corner and God hears the desperate Cry of his people and he comes down I was my husband was working in Charleston Tuesday and Wednesday it was a fight just to come to church from an accident sitting from 55 minutes or 85 just to get here and I told the Lord I'm coming anyway we get here from December up until this month we've been fighting with falsified fees that they've been adding on us when I say back into a corner it's like are we going to win the battle or win the war we're up for a renewal where it's just been a one problem after the next after next um Wednesday after we prayed about it after service was over we still hadn't heard anything about our renewal that's coming up in April everything around us where we want to stay is two to three times the amount

and put it in my work when I'm working I'm remembering all of them amen my wife broke out crying last night to see the love of God and to see that truly we have a family that is stronger than our physical family amen so learn to give God the preeminence learn to be able to leave Isaac if he needs us they give him Isaac he's not going to kill Isaac he just want to see where you're putting him what is the level you giving him are you gonna exhort his word above your necessary need or you want to go for your necessary need and Trust what he's trying to do we had Sisters Meeting by yesterday was a different caliber ask those that were there will tell you we thank you brother Mike and sister uh bridging it for your home we felt really home we sat like a family and we handed only three questions and it took three hours amen three questions you want to know them I'm sorry amen we talked about the soul tie we talked about a care of a woman slow down I went through the scripture you didn't know he was in the Bible my wife came back home she said I never thought something like this was in the scripture we presented the message wrong everybody okay we thought the sister should be wearing one skirt you know when I talk like this there is always a gun behind me you know that right you know that right I hope you're going to swallow it William Marion Branham before I give it to you this is a quote brother Kalima gave it to me and I felt like I need to share with everybody so I wanted to uh to put the code in uh in a group chat but I say no there is somebody online somewhere that would need it somewhere somewhere it will help a minister brother Branham says in the message adoption he say Oh Sister Scott I believe it is sitting here aren't you the one that was at home today a teaching going around somewhere you ready my brother in the world around different parts of the country I have heard of it lots what is the teaching that Jesus is here on Earth walking around in a body he comes in and does this that is a lie you will meet Jesus way everybody okay brother random say that is a lie his holy spirit is here and he's trying to place his church should us find Faith to get his church in order place it in the promised land so they can enter so all the enemy can be held drove out going back again to The Sisters Meeting let's go with this and I believe this what do you believe brother oh my that out in many of those great fun churches tonight great denomination of churches people who has not yet received the water Holy Spirit how many people many everybody okay but I believe down in the heart many of them has a what warm feeling toward who God and the Desiring the water baptism of the Holy Spirit you know the main thing is our message it is not the what message that is hindering it's the way presented sometimes how did you preach someone this message how did you present this message to somebody how did you present this message at work showing them that they grow the denominational they don't know anything how did you present this message [Applause] pastor colleague Minister how are we presenting the messages we cause the people to discuss this message by our Behavior and the way we presented the message the message is pure the message is that saved alone the message is perfectly in line with the Bible the message and the Bible are one the problem is how did you present the message how did you present Malachi for how did you introduce brother Branham to someone you leave the message you start taking care of yourself who told you the message say you should be dirty who told you that who told you the message say you should have a hair looking like somebody who just woke up front of sleep who told you that I don't want to take my time ask the young sister they will give you scripture and they will walk you out until you relax that you had the wrong conception and give me some time I promise to you to give you the quotes I'm gonna get the coach where brother Brad I'm saying a woman should look at her best I have a loaded and I'm gonna load you with that [Applause] I even have a coat of a woman complaining that her husband doesn't want to come to her because of the way she was looking and the quote brother Branham say I don't even blame him that minister relax my friend remember I don't have a bishop always remember that I am free as long as what I'm saying is in the Bible and the message of the hour I will say it loud and clear without any complex because it's not my word it is the word of God back up by the message of the hour who told you you should look unclean you see sister jogging like this and brother with big suit expensive suit who told you that sister God Made You Beautiful now remember Ephesians say we nourishing the body and we do what so cherish what God Made You make it look brighter not with Max Factor it would take some of your marriage problem out let me go back to my subject you want to know the content See the young sister they were taking notes some head iPad and everything you'll see them they will teach you I didn't say they will preach [Music] [Applause] everybody okay they will teach you just be humble everybody okay glory to God this church I need to preach we have question and answer on March the 18th how many heard that March the 13th we have question and answer it's always on Saturday how many heard that so remember we got question and answer God will see what you're doing amen you pray for me and I'm still waiting for the musician and the technician so we can have uh oh oh a session when I want to talk about music so if you want to sing in this church come in that session so you will learn the music okay we will go through the scripture we dig in the scripture and we come up with the message of the hour and you will learn what kind of music when I'm saying music take Wordly music out that's not the problem I'm talking about Christian music amen then you need to see what's going on amen don't worry it'll be all right there is one thing about me I would not change the standard of this message I'd rather leave and let somebody else take over but not me changing this message so when order is put don't try to manipulate leave it the way it was put because the order came according to William Marion Branham set everything in order according to the way I gave it to you and my order is not my order it's the order of the pastor of the age when I put it right there it's over it is up to you to shape yourself to fit the order not the order to fit you [Applause] in other words I am not going to change the message I am not going to lower the message I'm Gonna Leave it wrong pure an adulterated what message can I give you I don't have any glory to God we had the problem with our website there was uh like a spyware or something that attacked the website wasting their time but we got everything fixed up and the new website is there if you want to see it you go spoken word Tabernacle make sure you put NC because there are some spoken word Tabernacle our sisters church so make sure you put NC so you can get into our website everybody okay I got that one covered praise be to the name of the Lord Lord's willing today at the end of the service but Robert if you can remind me we will pray for the officer I went through the host I did my homework I talked back and forth and I express your concern and I already show you the new order if something is going on see your brother don't talk to nobody else don't be the one receiving phone calls and trying to manage things if somebody calls you say please don't call me go ahead and see that person amen So when you say no I will ask you did you see him did you talk to him did you take another brother we need to follow everybody okay if he repented under the blood you forget everything we keep moving if he didn't repent then we go see him everybody okay you can refer to everything back glory to God praise God welcome to spoken word Tabernacle Amen brother abrahamara will be coming in the month of April but the problem his schedule was already booked and he could not make it to this church when brother Chad told him that there is no way you can make it here he says no way I'm gonna add another week to make sure I go to spoken away so brother Abraham added one week in his trip to make sure he make it here and for some reason the week that was added ended up putting us to be the first place that he's coming amen amen so that will be uh April the 28th it's gonna be a Friday he will fly in here he will be here on Friday we need to pick him up at the airport then he will preach on Sunday April the 30th you can put that down brother Abraham Mara you know brother abrahamara the man is really gifted and he's humble the man can sit and tell you what's going on in this church without talking to you and he even told me that we sat down he said this is the way your church is your church is like this like this like this like this a very strong prophetic gift I know don't worry and everything he told me was perfect everybody okay so April the 30th he will be preaching that will be Sunday and he will also preach on May the Third on Wednesday so we got two service with brother Abraham Mara so he will preach on Sunday and then he will preach on Wednesday then on Thursday he will be heading back uh straight toward brother chadland so this year you're going to have him twice so pray for the meeting and everything will be okay if you don't remember him you go on on YouTube you search on our Channel you will see him very wonderful brother so we got him twice for this year God opened the way he will be here except if the Rapture comes by amen everybody okay now let's go to a scripture this morning that's why I feel comfortable on Sunday because I have your announcement taking my time so when you start counting my time take the announcement off take the songs off take the special off then you start counting my time then you turn your clock on click amen same scripture because I could not move at all what we trying to get into here is a different territory I don't know how far we will go because the Holy Spirit keeps on folding things over and over and when I was in the office this morning I added three more coats so relax do not sleep because I'm gonna get into areas sometime it causes a lot of mess in a message and there is camp in the message because of this so let's go slow with me let's read Brother Brad I'm slow did you hear me I'm going to start with brother Branham and that dig down in the scripture and you'll see where it's coming from and you're gonna see yourself everybody okay and also whoever I have not responded to please forgive me be patient with me I never understood when people say they're getting the agenda booked now I understand money is overbooked I'm overbooked at work and I'm more of a booked in church if you call my office they will give you an appointment in May or towards June hey everybody okay don't say oh he's talking about his office why is he talking about the office hey slow down I'm with my family I know how to shoot the devil everybody okay I know how to shoot that devil hey everybody okay so if I have not responded or we are still working on your uh appointment just be patient with me amen sometimes we try to move the devil is attacking this one in the hospital this one you know this one's sick and we're trying to move thank God for the Deacon because there is somebody that need to be baptized and I didn't even have time and brother Kelly pick it up do you want to know who I won't tell you his name but I'm going to just tell him to raise his hand look around who want to get baptized raise your hand brother look at him [Music] [Applause] do you see do you see there is a lot of work going on so you understand what's going on everybody good let's go to Romans chapter 8. what I like about you you get the signal quickly I can talk to you I can talk to you before somebody and they don't understand what we're talking when you get married you will learn that [Laughter] Roman 8 verse 10 if you dare you can say Amen and if Christ be in you the body is dead is that right because of sin but the spirit is life because of righteousness you might be seated but if the spirit is my voice okay remember when I get loud I'm not yelling at anyone it is my makeup everybody good okay I don't want somebody get offended why is he loud go ask my maker but if the spirit of him that which this that's where the theology got in trouble because they take a human being they put him into uh to be a Catholic priest and they change him completely even his way of talking making him a big hypocrite when people are laughing he's trying to go no laugh laugh the way you laugh how are you doing no laughs what's wrong hey let me free too much headache it's a family body and if the spirit of I know what I'm doing as you're getting relaxed the needle is coming and if the spirit of him that raise up Jesus from the dead dwelling you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall do what also Quicken your mortal Body by his spirit that dwell out in you so first of all before you can have that quickening the spirit of God must be in you first if the Holy Ghost is not in you how is he going to Quicken your body that's why with that the Holy Ghost you cannot go in the rapture because you must have the decoder yes of the Rapture the one that that that triggered the Rapture must be in you so he can trigger the rapture everybody good glory to God job to verse 17. and if children then Heir heir of God and joined hair with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we may also glorify together glorify together everybody okay for I reckon that the suffering of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed where in US Paul is talking about the believer Having the Holy Spirit and when you have the Holy Spirit remember glorification you already glorify on the inside but now Paul is talking about another glorification that will happen in you remember there is two glorification two translation you remember that glory to God for the earnest expectation of the creature waits for the manifestation of the sons of God for the creature was made subject to vanity not willingly but by reason of him who has subjected the same in Hope because the creature itself also shall be delivered from the bondage of corruption into the water glorious Liberty it's a glorious Liberty of the children of God for we know that the whole creation remember this grown and traveling pain together until now watch this carefully and not only death nature but ourselves also which have the water first fruit so you cannot groan without the Holy Ghost In You it is the holy spirit that gets on you and begin to get uncomfortable of what is going on because he want to make sure whatever is around him is okay so when the Holy Ghost is moving he looks he said there is a black dog here you remember the white dog and a black dog then the fight to begin then the Holy Spirit begin to dominate everybody okay the black dog as much as you given or you paying attention to him the one you feed the most everybody okay which have the first fruit of the spirit even we ourselves do what grown grown inside ourselves waiting for the water adoption to do what witness to which the Redemption of our body why are you groaning because something is wrong with your body that's why we go to the hospital that's why we're getting coronavirus all of that because it's reminding you that something is wrong everybody okay that's why we start having gray hair it's telling you something is wrong everybody good let's go to First Corinthians 15. Oh Glory to God if you're there you can say Amen verse 40 the Bible says this they are also what the first body is a what celestial what is a Celestial body amen Celestial means from Heaven There are also Celestial body Karma and water for us to raise your body the second body is terrestrial terrestrial or Earthly meaning comes from here amen glory to God but the glory of the selection is what one in other words the celestial has its own Glory the celestial has its own Glory everybody okay if I'm not mistaken and the glory of the Teresa is water another another word the two have glories but those two glories are different remember last Sunday we explained to you about your glory what we spoke yesterday in the Sisters Meeting how to take care of your glory ah you ask the young sister they already covered full coverage amen glory to God jump to verse 42. so also is the resurrection of the dead it is somehow in corruption it is raised how in corruption it is somehow in this honor it is raised how in glory which glory is always I thought he was already in glory but this glory is lighter than the glory that is going to come up with right everybody okay so when you are resurrected you will have a glory let me put it like number three here there is a glory so how many Glory do we have now everybody okay it is sown in weakness it is how in power it is sun a natural body everybody okay it is raised a water spiritual body I'm gonna put this as number three so you relax okay I know when I say spiritual you say but seriously spiritual hold on a spiritual body everybody okay so we got Celestial body it's spiritual right right it is also spiritual but there is also what we call a spiritual body and we would know what does it mean so Celestial body have a glory Terrace your body have a glory and spiritual body has also a glory god is perfected in three that's right we okay amen it is rest and not your body uh it is a sun and natural body it is raised a spiritual body there is a natural body and there is a spiritual body let me help you you who who is uh struggling when they say spiritual body the one we bury is the Earthly body okay it doesn't means if you calling this spiritual body so you are telling me when you bury a body if the person resurrected he becomes a theophany he become a Celestial body no Resurrection bring only what you remember the definition brother Branham say Resurrection means whatever you put in that's what is coming up amen but Paul is saying when he come out he won't come out the way he was there he come out differently did I help you it's some stabilizing screw somewhere everybody okay glory to God we on verse 44 jump to verse 49 and as we have borne the image of the water Earthly we also will bear the image of the water heavily stop there this is the Earthly body the celestial bodies here Paul is saying you born let me help you a different way it's my way of preaching okay let me help you this way this is you everybody okay before you come in this world God begin to manufacture your clothing are we okay that clothing is what mom is taking to the hospital to the OB GYN it's a clothing it's an envelope it is a whole you are not there everybody okay it is just a manufacturing that's what mommy keeps going nine month everybody okay that is not really you you are somewhere let me help somebody who's struggling God taught Jeremiah you got it now before you were but before you were formed in your mother's womb I already wanted you you so Jeremiah was somewhere before he entered it everybody Okay we okay now so when we go into the delivery home as soon as you come out and uh slap you a little bit a gospel protoplasma then suddenly where that's when you just everybody okay everybody okay that's when the real you is in other words you took on a clothing for you okay now Paul is saying the same way you were clothed with this guy from Mama amen one of this day you will wear another jacket amen but these two jackets looking like everybody okay if you take your first jacket and your second jacket they're twins so you are in the middle going this way or going this way everybody okay everybody good thank you let's go verse 49 and as we have borne the image of the Earthly we shall also bear the image of the Heavenly it's a promise we're there let's go to Ephesians 5 then we pray oh God you see how my time goes Madness announcement Ephesians 5 25 if you dare you can say amen amen husband we went through this with the younger sister they can see the scripture in a different light than most of you amen husband love your wife even as Christ loved the church and gave himself for it that he must sanctify and cleanse it with the watching of the water water ah so in the nutshell you got to take a bath let's continue leave it alone buy the word everybody okay presented to himself a glorious Water Church not having water spot or what wrinkle or any such thing but it should be how holy without blemish remember all these characteristics if I can get there everybody okay without blemish let's stop right here and I'm gonna give you this theme so we pray Paul John says this he says beloved now are we the sons of God and he do not yet what appear what we what shall be so even though you are the Son of God you are not really reflecting what you are supposed to be everybody okay so the way we look at one another we are not really what we are supposed to be everybody okay another word now you have the Holy Ghost everybody okay but we know that when he shall appear Jesus Christ we shall be like water him we cannot be different than him how was he how is he gonna look like for we shall see him as how he is and every man that have this hope in him do whatever purify himself even as he is water so he's not talking to people who are living unclean it's people that are pure by the inner men are we okay now buckle up and let's take off let's pray Heavenly Father Lord we are approaching you humbly this morning Father thanking you once again for your grace for your love your mercy father and for everything you have been doing for us father this is as much as I can do by the ability you have given us father I pray that you moved me completely out of the way may you come and minister to your children father made the devil and his army be completely out of this place by May the Holy Spirit and the elect Angel be in this place Lord to minister speak to our soul be the Alpha and the Omega of this service as we commit each other unto the hand those that are hearing the one that is preaching the one who's translating and the one that are hearing through the translator father touch each one and those that are streaming in Jesus precious name amen glory to God okay my subject this morning is the four phases of roof the theophany and Resurrection we okay the four phases of roof but the theme today is theophany and what Resurrection we're still going back and forth between roof chapter 3 and roof chapter four everybody okay which is interpreted in the Tabernacle as the roof being in the holiest and getting ready to disappear to another Tabernacle everybody okay what is a theophany everybody okay by the root of the word theophany has two words everybody okay the first word is tears which means god everybody okay and the second word is called Fannin amen which is me which means to show and it's interpreted as an appearance everybody okay so by definition theophany is a visible manifestation or appearing of a god did I lost anyone to your family by definition is a visible manifestation manifestation or a visible appearing amen of a deity everybody okay but according to Psalm 86 the Bible said yeah gods and all of you are the children of the water most high everybody okay so theophany is not only for God I'm going slowly is not only for God it is also for gods [Applause] I'm back everybody okay so far because we know that at the beginning God was the eternal spirit you remember that now everybody okay and from the eternal spirit God birthed himself you already understand this now when he birth himself he birthed from himself unto something that was called the logos which is the word everybody okay so God that's a spirit left this part here everybody care and God entered into that thing that he created the Bible says in Psalm 104 that God cover himself with light as a government everybody okay that light is what we call the logos it is also called the pillar of Fire everybody okay then God moved from this logos here after God veiled himself God wearing the first clothing everybody okay then God moved into flesh remember that we went through that many many times amen and when God moved to inflam to flesh everybody good whatever was here everybody clear that got into here he took this and this and put all of them in one everybody okay another word when God moved from the spirit into the logos God disappeared from here everybody okay now the Lord Gods become God [Applause] the fullness of the god word of of the godhead badly everybody okay then when God moved from this stage into this stage whatever was here disappear everybody okay so if God is in here amen you can go all around here you won't find God [Applause] [Music] everybody okay if you go right here you won't find God you will find God only on one place [Applause] that's why when Jesus keeps saying the Father the Father the father Philip said wait a minute show us the father Jesus look he said you don't understand Philip when you see me you are seeing the father in other words I am the manifestation I am the father made flesh me and my father are one everybody okay so far everybody good so far this process here brother Branham called this the regular line in other words it is the correct way everybody in this building should have come everybody good what is 80 or funny William Marion Branham glory to God bacola pretty good my friend as we going up brother Branham said the great fountain of all eternity was the spirit of love Joy number one and that spirit and uh that Spirit of honesty that Spirit of water trueness in its way in this water Perfection and then out of the existence of the water father went water the logos which was the sun which was a water the alphony so the second stage here which we call the logos is where your theophany is everybody good which is the body of the Great Water Jehovah God went forth in the water bless your body so your Celestial body is also called water any question glory to God he said that is the logos the word spoke out of them great Fountain of Life and went forth and there was the water the alphony which God was made into water everybody okay that's why we call that the word everybody okay this one was the spirit and the spirit is the father they call him father because he's the one that started the one that gave birth a girl a birth by a man everybody okay it is not our not trust he will tell me who was watching movies [Applause] everybody okay everybody okay the Bible said don't go Google that one the logos which was the son of God did what went out created by this great Fountain of Purity God as the spirit did whatever well now and he created the water he was a body he was in the form of what we are now everybody okay so this to your funny is a body that look like a terrestrial body everybody okay what is a theophany it is a body that does not have a water spirit in it push the brake push the brake everybody okay so the first body that started is the recipient called theophany everybody okay then the second body that we get into it is the the what we call the flesh or the terrorists yeah amen or the Earthly amen this one we call it Celestia we call it the logos we call it the word Etc everybody okay so you are here amen amen you can go here or you can go here you just changing body everybody okay but brother Branham say we went dead to your funny is formed it's a body that doesn't have a spirit on it everybody good open second Corinthians glory to God I'm going slow this way because I know the confusion in the message everybody okay everybody okay I'm gonna help someone okay I'm gonna help somebody don't go out and say he's trying to show off okay let me lock that one again this is Alexis are we okay this one is a Cadillac birth of this car belonged to someone everybody good when that person is driving the Lexus he's Cadillac is empty are you following me the Cadillac is sitting home he have gas he have potential you can crank the engine but the one the driver is not there [Applause] are we following me when he's driving the Cadillac don't go search him in the Lexus but both of this car are in the garage have I gotten you is everything okay is everything okay let me go this way so I give you two so if you come after me I will shoot you with the second one this car is a Mercedes and this one is an Audi so we we we we with the same everybody okay everybody okay when this person what I'm trying to say the first person was a man the second one is not a man it's a woman thank you I hope you're getting what I'm saying so both men and women have that amen when that lady is here this car is empty if they ask you they say where is so and so he said she left which car did she left with because if you go on the road you don't know which car she's using you will miss her you need to know which car she's driving to know how to identify her do you follow me do you follow me do you follow me let's go now to Second Corinthians chapter five let me remove this quickly they say the pastor uses expensive car you can switch it put a Nissan and uh Buick whatever you want to put GMC whatever you want to put it okay amen for we know first one that is our Earthly water house stop everybody okay this body here Paul called them also houses I want you to keep that in mind everybody okay so in the scripture when we say house you need to be careful let me help you up again because somebody needs some help one day Jesus was coming out of a temple everybody okay and he begin to look at the temple he looked he looked he looked he look he said wow the disciples said look how big it is look how Solomon built this and Jesus look at his stuff he say you know what let me tell you something destroy this Temple and I will build it in water they thought the Bible said he was talking about the building but the Bible said it's in John chapter 2. he was talking about his own water so your body at the Temple of the Holy Ghost everybody okay so this body here you can call it a house you can call it a temple and we can call it also a tabernacle are we okay I know where I'm heading we okay verse one for we know that if our Earthly water house Earthly house is number two everybody here Paul is saying if you are living on number two amen and something happened with number two you get into a car right boom and you die what happened everybody okay Paul says if we if uh if our Earthly House of this water Tabernacle Tabernacle where water dissolved in other words if they take you and they bring sulfuric acid full concentrated and they put you inside until you begin to Disappear Completely if they take you and they begin to cremate you until you become ashes what happened what they have destroyed is not you they only destroy your car [Applause] everybody okay they only destroy your house everybody okay they only destroy your body they only destroy your temple they only destroy your Tabernacle everybody okay what happened if one of these days your house get destroyed are we okay verse I won for we know that if our every house of this Tabernacle were dissolved we have a water a building power called that a building let me ask you a question I'm loading the foundation are you ready do you find the building in the village let's go slowly building big building do you find them in villages where do you find big buildings this church you put yourself in trouble building you found them where keep that in mind very carefully slow down don't jump slow slow slow slow down everybody okay are we okay let's go he says we have a building of what God so Paul is telling us there is a house that is made by God everybody good this house here number two was made by mama and daddy everybody okay through sex they brought this house right here everybody okay this house here have a mother and this house here have a father everybody okay but Paul is saying that there is another house another body another Temple another Tabernacle another building that is not made by God by man it is made by God are we good Karma a house not made with water hence how is the house Eternal in the water heaven so the house cannot die everybody okay the house is eternal everybody okay in other words that's why Jesus said do not be afraid of people that can destroy this house because I have a backup I have a house that no one can destroy [Applause] everybody okay once the house is made it is made eternally [Music] everybody okay let's go to verse two glory to God for in this remember Roman 8. we do water we grow on Paul is saying in number two everybody good we are groaning we are not comfortable we are groaning everybody okay Paul said in this we groan earnestly Desiring clothed so those houses are clothing are we okay it is a clothing a jacket everybody okay he said earnestly Desiring to be clothed upon with our house which is from water Heaven Paul is saying you already have a jacket amen but in that jacket you are groaning because you reckon us I'm missing something of me yeah yeah I'm gonna help someone I'm clothed okay but I don't have my suit on everybody good this is a clothing this is a clothing I am Desiring to take my suit and to put on so that now I have the shirt and the suit everybody good Paul say for in this we groan earnestly Desiring to be clothed upon not to remove one no you want to stay on this one you just wanna add another one on top of this why is why are we looking for that because the beginning The Way We were supposed to come we were supposed to be picking up that body first everybody okay then go into the face but something happened to us we skip a step now this body is telling us there is a piece of me that is missing [Applause] are we following me do you follow me glory to God jump to verse 3 if so be that being clothed we shall not be found how naked everybody okay so if you don't have that body when God screen you you are naked even though you already have a body make it doesn't mean what you're thinking naked means when God is screening you he doesn't see God are you following me let me re-explain you in other words when the big theophany is looking at you he doesn't see a theophany in you so you are naked not by flesh but you are naked by theophany you are supposed to have theophany [Applause] you are supposed to have another garment [Applause] but you put a garment without the undergarment that's why you are naked [Applause] do you follow me do you follow me do you follow me jump to verse 4 4 we data in this water Tabernacle do what grown being how burden not for that we should be water I'm close no no we don't want to take this off this one love hamburger we want to keep this one because they all belong

old you got gray hair wrinkle all over everybody okay when this clothing that you skip come on you amen when he it's like uh he has like a bandit amen when he connects to you do you follow me because there is the law of spirit of of life that is greater than the law of sin and there's two things sin and but there's no also the spirit of life is how that's why Moses has only one road but the magician have two roads do you follow me when they put the snake of Moses the snake of Moses was pulling the two snakes everybody okay and swallow both of them and the two snakes disappear and the snake of Sir of Moses is still normal if you open the snake of Moses you don't see where the snake are are we together are we together in other words when the theophany comes do you follow me when he

today you can make my child sick today but one day you see this bye bye one day you will be your end [Applause] glory to God glory to God my God verse 6 therefore we are always how confident knowing that while we are at Water home number two he called that now a home [Applause] [Music] why we are how everybody okay while we are home in the water body stop remember brother Branham says here that it is a body that doesn't have what a spirit the spirit where in other words when they go if you go right now in heaven if they look in their body you are not there the reason why you are not there is because you are driving the Cadillac [Applause] everybody okay that's why Paul is saying when we are at home in number two what happened before the Lord while we are home in the body we are half absent from who the Lord in other words if God call in heaven where are you the theophan is looking because you are down there then the Holy Spirit have to come down and say where is she at she's in spoken word Tabernacle listening to the sermon this morning then the Holy Spirit Come he said okay there she is you are absent the Lord but you are present in the body but the main key is you are also there I don't know if you're getting me you are also there with your father your other vehicle is there [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] you don't follow me if you are there it means that you come from where and if I come from God I will be [Applause] that's why you heard Jesus say I come from and I will do what because theophany is a manifestation of a what and what everybody okay everybody okay we good job to verse 8. we are water confident confident I say and women rather to be water absent from the water body stop Paul is saying I prefer even to leave this car because here I have a hard time seeing my father I have to pray pray fast fast two days three days four days pray pray before I can begin to feel the anointing but over there me and my father okay everybody okay everybody okay what are you trying to say let me pick up somebody you got two cars one is in the garage you are driving one Paul say in the garage at home that's where my father is I'd rather leave this car here and go with the car that is in the garage because the car in the garage is very close to the father then the car on the highway [Music] everybody good let's read verse six he's eight we are confidence I say of and willing rather to be how absent before from this from the body and be water present with the water so Paul is saying that when you are we are here we are absent here Paul said already live here because as soon as I'm not here you want to find me where in that word you cannot be living without a body foreign [Music] when you just about to leave this body are you following me this one comes already and park and open the door and it's already warm up the air conditioning is already working the climate is good it's just waiting as soon as you leave that one you enter that one and the Asha closes the the door and you start driving that's why death is only a doing you see what brother Branham said it is only something that is making you switch her [Music] Lord help me everybody okay go to Philippians chapter one let me at least get this my God this church this church this church laughs distant let's go to Philippians chapter one we there we there amen Philippians chapter 1 verse 21. if you dare you can say amen amen listen to Paul for to me to leave his word Christ and to die is water again how can Paul say that in other words Paul is not even afraid of the devil anymore when the Devil comes he said go ahead and kill me you want to kill me it's again you kill me I'm going straight to the I I'm already Desiring that body because that one is eternal it doesn't get sick when coronavirus come over there when he hits the body remember he swallow death he swallow that body as soon as something comes you swallow it disappear Paul say he has suffered backache go ahead kill me I'm dead that's why to die is a game why to die is pushing me into here everybody okay verse 22 but if I live in the flesh number two this is the fruit of my what labor yet what shall I choose I know not for I am in a straight between what two Paul say now I'm debating I'm looking at the pro and cons I'm looking at the advantage here I'm suffering here things is going here there's no suffering I'm waiting between the two I'm trying to pick and choose everybody okay verse uh 23 for I am in straight in other words I'm stuck between two having a desire to what the power and to be with who Christ which is what far better so when you enter theophany is far better because he brings you close to your father everybody okay watch verse 24 nevertheless to abide in the flesh is more water need for for who for who for who in other words Paul is saying if he was not for you the church I'd rather go but if I go I love you I want to make sure you're in a better position before I can go because to God it's better for me but if I go you will bury me you won't see me and if I stay it is on you for your advantage in other words either way the devil is losing [Applause] when they are staying or when they somebody die you have not lost anything hey everybody okay everybody okay listen to this brother now you understand why brother Branham say the spirit is not there look at one statement for brother Branham how long you take brother what I'm saying it's a body that doesn't have a water a spirit in it it's a body that is water waiting for you who creation now it makes sense he said as soon as this life everybody good everybody good buddy I'm just at the beginning slow down I'm ready his first body was Spirit God Supernatural all right the great Eternal we went through that Daddy the second he began to form toward water flesh in a theophany it is called the water the word a water body this dam is the state he was in when he met Abraham City he was in the form of water the alphony now we shall get to that and prove it in a few minutes Lord's willing he wants the water buckle up this body here now we understand what a theophan is what are certain characteristic of the theophany everybody okay glory to God brother Branham said now the logos that went out of God which is the logos that are funny all this begin to form into a body shape and this body shape was called in the scholar things teaching water the logos the logos that went out of who God in other words a better word for it is what we call Air the alphony watch carefully let's go 25 miles an hour school zone we ready to your funny is a human body that is how glorify stop [Applause] theophany is not a glorified body slow down and know what I'm fighting with now in a message I know what I'm fighting with it is a human body that have a glory [Music] let's buy the brand I'm interpret itself can I continue not exactly with water Flesh and Blood like he will be in there glorified stage you my brother wherever you are slow down when you read the prophet everybody okay so the reason not the body which is a spiritual body but brother born I'm called that a glorified everybody okay that Celestial body have a glory that the rest your body have a glory the spiritual or glorified body have also a water brother Branham say to your funny is glorified but not like it's gonna be glorified everybody okay everybody okay I know slow down I'm maneuvering there is asteroid coming this way okay so let me flip the ship everybody okay not exactly with water flesh and water blood you're gonna understand why like he will be in the water glorify stage but it is a form of a human body that doesn't eat stop neither does he drink it but it is a body a body that is waiting for us as soon as we leave what this one so according to brother pranam to your funny don't eat are you okay to your funny don't drink but said but your body here you are eating you are drinking hold on because somebody's trying to fight away from me on glorified body hold on I have a bullet everybody okay watch brother now now in there we enter into a body that is the kind of body that God was theophany when he's full he said let us make water man in our own image in our own water likeness everybody okay in other words God was right here in the beginning what's the word that's the body God was making things we okay watch carefully William Marion Branham When We Go From Here There is a water Tabernacle a tabernacle just an image of a water man that don't eat that dog drink that don't sleep and wake up forever because it's Eternal everybody okay there is where we go to but they are waiting under their altar crying water lord how long how long to come back down because they want to do water shake hands with one another they want to sit down and do what eat and do what talk to one another they are what human blessed be the name of the Lord slow down caress your body we eat Celestia value to your family we don't eat brother Stephen but you say there is a glorified body brother Branham saying theophany can appear and disappear everybody okay but your body here you you are stuck ready you don't disappear you are where you are everybody okay let's go to Luke chapter 24. called to help me hold my I'm still good in time it's just the depth we are it's like we're in eternity so my time is not even up yet whoever is wondering or yawning everybody okay everybody okay it's a sense of humor I have all bullets buddy you there let's go to first uh Luke 24 verse 36 if you there you can say amen amen listen carefully Jesus was born when Jesus was born Jesus was eating matter the fact when he went to a tree he was hungry he didn't see food he cursed the tree brother Branham said his weakness was full hunger you need the code to see me everybody okay everybody okay everybody okay when Jesus died they took the body and they left it in the Tomb but the Bible said he went down to prison and begin to preach to souls in prison which body did Jesus enter as soon as you die if this Tabernacle is dissolved Jesus also have his own everybody okay now remember Melchizedek didn't eat slow down if you go to Genesis 14. Melchizedek brought Abraham Bread and Wine but watch the scripture he didn't eat anything you say but if he doesn't eat where did he get bread where did the angel cook a cake for uh for Elijah where did he get the cake how can an angel cook cake but the angel don't eat where did he get the cake everybody okay but in Genesis 18 . everybody okay Melchizedek made the body of Flesh everybody okay and he step on when he stepped on he went to Abraham Abraham cooked pork chop Abraham was not a Jew the Judo is Big Abraham was a gentile the Jews started from Jacob okay okay relax everybody okay they put they give him a good meat and because melchized that when he came in flesh he was not vegetarian [Music] [Applause] he loves steak [Applause] okay app go search your scripture everybody okay they cook for him and he begin to eat and say Abraham where is your wife Sarah in Genesis 14 he could not eat Abraham never give him food but in Genesis 18 when he took number two then number two need food everybody okay so you understand Jesus before his death he could eat when he died he pick up his tea off and eat no more eating appear and disappear your body doesn't disappear now what happened when Jesus when he rose from the dead Luke chapter 24 verse 36. are you there now oh God Amen and as this that spoke Jesus himself did what stood in the midst of them in the midst of them and said to them do what peace be unto you in other words the disciple was stalking and suddenly Jesus pop up they say uh human being don't appear if it's a human being the ring have to go Kingdom then we open the door and get it but this one didn't ring the door matter of fact the door is locked Peter went and checked the alarm the alarm say stay wrong in other words when you open the door the alarm should say pee pee pee pee then somebody need to punch the code are we okay Peter said wait a minute the alarm is still on he checked the first door locked by telling me went there he said check the back door look so how did you make it everybody okay everybody okay they say ah if you pass and you are appearing you are not human you're a ghost what do you want to stay a little bit there are you following me are you following me let's where am I God gracious verse 237 but they were how terrified why were they terrified and frightened and suppose that they had seen the water spirit because only Spirit only to your furnace appear and what but this one yes crust Yes master Philip over there was like John John John stay here everybody okay everybody okay verse 30 and he said to them why are you trouble and why do taught a rise in your heart he started Discerning again [Applause] in other words when Jesus looked at them this one is saying my God my God I'm not ready to die mommy I said Jesus said what is going on chill out what's going on because you appear without the door only Celestial body can do that everybody following me job 2 verse 39 behold minds and by what see and it is who I myself do water Handle Me Jesus said wait a minute you know that it's me come and touch me out Thomas they didn't say hey watch out touching him stay away then everybody okay everybody okay Jesus said please come come and hand them he says be there until they were hidden namaste everybody okay everybody good verse 37 handle me and see for a water spirit have not water flesh and water bonds as we Jesus Christ resurrected with flesh and born but for some reason he can disappear and he can appear [Applause] what can the Flesh and born are disappearing if you try to go this way you're gonna bump the wall do you follow me but if Jesus goes this way you will see him pass and he's outside he said are you following me you say I'm stuck how did you get through this wall Jesus said I'm just like you they say no yeah it's flesh born flesh and Bone begin to appear and disappear we know the Natural Body we know that your family to your funny don't appear he appear and disappear okay that one yes not your body do not disappear they only appear look at your funny doesn't it it doesn't drink but only the terrestrial can eat and drink do you follow me do you follow me Jesus said well thought everybody okay verse 40 and when he had that spoken he showed them his hand and his feet and while they yet believe not for joy and wonder he said to them have you here any water meat Jesus said boy oh boy boy boy you see the long-suffering of God even though you don't understand he's still going Extra Man to make sure you get it everybody okay when he looked he say whoa oh boy oh boy they touch me they still don't believe I show them this card they don't believe what did you cook today this one said oh Peter say yes yes give it to him we will see the truth if he's going to eat they say yes we got a hamburger from McDonald's get it let's see let's see because this is the last determinant because he often either it are you okay are you okay let's go verse 42 and they gave him a piece of water more fish and a water a honeycomb and of a honeycomb and he took it and did what eats before them now the disciple don't understand what is a human body that can appear and disappear in another word you following me when Jesus Resurrected he had a body that mixed the celestial and the Celeste and the terrorists are together I am going I don't know if you get me we found out that the resurrected Jesus Christ is immortal he cannot die but he can eat but he can drink but he can disappear everybody okay now the characteristic of the theophany and the characteristic of the Natural Body the characteristic of one and the characteristic of two are seen in one body I don't know if you get me in other words the glorified body is a mixture of the theophany and the terrestrial together [Applause] Have I Lost You when you receive a glorified body because Paul say in this we were groaning we want to be what Clover we want to get the second clothing on us when you get the second clothing on top of what you have your first clothing your tea or funny and this body when they meet together they they fuse together they they blend together as they are blending together they begin to manifest a body called the glorified body have I lost anyone another word glorified body number three equal number one plus number two any question hang tight and I'm gonna head up and drop to the airport we ready all right we understand this what are you trying to say Amen oh my God hear the game again with the Devil amen let's see that's where we were okay glory to God you there brother Branham say that's the one that stay behind to the elect church he showed a son Genesis 18 and it was God doing that he was not a meat he was not a water the elephant do not eat it he eats the Flesh of a calf Genesis 18. he eats some whole cake cornbread I ate them yesterday and some butter on it and drunk the milk somebody drank milk yesterday from the cow at the orphan it does not water or water drink it was God made manifest in a flesh by the blood I'm saying Genesis 18 he was not a theophany because the man was eating everybody okay everybody okay everybody okay everybody okay now you understand what a theophan is right where are you going with this Lord help me if I can struck the first part everybody okay where are you going with this Lord help me everybody okay according to Genesis 1 26 God made Adam follow me carefully ah please check somebody's hand somebody got the message you ready brother uh brother Kelly we call this theophany because I can't touch the resurrection we ready so whoever didn't read First Corinthians 15 go ahead and read it and catch up everybody okay according to Genesis 1 God 126 God made man in his own image and in his own water likeness the man came out if we call one another we look we don't see Adam you say Adam you say yes where are you say I'm here Adam yes you hear yes if if say yes where are you guys we're here come closer Adam and Eve come closer shake my hand you do this do you follow me when you do this your hand doesn't stuck it goes this way you say about it where are you I'm healing I'm right here oh touch me you do this you see your hand going all the way to the back God say no brother Greg won't understand Genesis 2 7. are you following me are you following me God went and stood up and look at the Dust and say Adam come out everybody's following me suddenly Out of the Dust begin to Will are you following me and we see somebody [Music] now brother Greg get me saying oh so this is Adam everybody okay God say Adam come out from the vehicle are you following me he took Adam from that vehicle and put him there then the Adam that was like this suddenly goes God bless you brother Greg everybody okay everybody okay when brother Greg now goes he goes this way him and Adam brother great he he said that's it he said buddy he said yes it's me Greg how are you doing everybody good everybody good here is the problem when God spoke Adam when Adam came he was not a baby are you following me Adam was created a grown-up man everybody following me everybody will come follow me so the first time God created man he created him by this spoken word [Applause] thank you Jesus everybody okay and when that man from the spoken word came out he came out a grown-up man I'm sorry he was not a baby and that man had not a father everybody okay that man has not a mother are you following me now the way he created Adam he didn't create Adam a toddler he didn't create Adam a teenager God created Adam in a age where Adam can get married [Applause] everybody okay so when the first man created originally by the spoken word when he came out he was in the age that he can get married because God married them God look at Adam he said Adam you cannot stay like this God didn't wait for Adam to grow up before he get married Adam was created ready to get married [Applause] everybody okay everybody okay everybody good in other words when God created the first man the first man was neither a baby nor an old man [Music] everybody okay the first creation of God was a man in the middle age everybody okay another word Adam was a young man [Applause] everybody okay when God created Adam Adam was not growing up I'm going slowly and Adam was not getting older if Adam was created 18 years old no let me change if Adam was created 21 years old everybody okay every day that the years goes Adam is still 21. if you see Adam tomorrow if you come after 25 if you come after 25 years I Adam is still 21. everybody okay everybody okay what are you trying to say hold on and I'm gonna be lending this ship brother Branham says this he says there was a tree of life 64. in the Garden of Eden that he might have what eaten eaten from it if he had not failed that tree of life remanded him him who Adam all the time that his youth was what conditionally continually how going on everybody okay so Adam will grow in years on the inside but his body was still the same age are you following me God also created ease everybody okay when God created it instead of Eve coming up as a baby if also come up a grown-up woman ready to get married when God created if if was automatically Heaven period how could the devil get her pregnant everybody okay imagine what the original spoken word of God doesn't create babies didn't create babies he created grown-up people not all there in a certain age where they are younger and they are ready to get married but they don't grow old they don't get sick because death have not entered them yet they have not seen it because the wages of sin was death that's right everybody okay as long as death didn't struck Adam the body of Adam was still the same because brother Branham said the tree of life was reminding him that you are staying young everybody okay youth continually everybody okay but once Adam and Eve disobey are you following me and sin entering suddenly after five years Adam seen something changing his body begin to react differently than before he begin to have the marks of death what are you trying to say brother Branham I can't even touch this is like 10 I don't believe there shall Billy the babies in heaven everybody okay Sharon Ross died as a baby this message perfectly in line with the scripture everybody okay brother Branham bearish Sharon Rose as a baby with a mother but when brother Branham went to the sixth Dimension he saw a young lady coming up ready to get married say Daddy Daddy brother Branham say wait a minute a woman grown up like this me your father he said who are you he said Daddy to me say you who say I'm Sharon Rose but Cheryl you grown up what's happening everybody okay when their sisters begin to come they said my precious brother my precious brother one came and had brother Brown I'm so hard he said brother Branham if you didn't come brother Brian I'm saying who is this [Applause] somebody say you remember that 90 years old [Applause] are you following me you remember that 90 years old woman that's her another word in heaven the babies goes to a certain age and the order dropped down to a certain age to meet an edge that they are younger like Adam [Music] are we okay I have to stop somewhere because it's deeper they say if they are resurrected little babies they always believe the water babies if they are real old people that resurrect on the cannon crutches it be that way immortality don't know we will be how one age one what thing forever wish up you how one age I believe we form a heart above the age of Hope Jesus [Music] amen amen somebody say 33. hey man that is just my beard thought I don't know immortality if he resurrect a little baby that big it will be always be how that way I believe we shall be how one age there shall be no old or young we shall be just in the middle age right their house forever I believe men and women God when he did it tell if she was going to be another thing grow up or Adam he just made them in his own image and that is the way he shall do it again that is a full grown-up water statue of people in other words the way God created Adam he created Adam at the standard of his theophany everybody okay everybody okay so if you have the loved one that have gone go search the picture when they were younger begin to recalibrate your mind everybody okay everybody okay if you have a baby that was gone don't worry when you see him you will see the real him everybody okay brother brought him say every couple skill everywhere when you was at your best right at the water Peak God said now the pictures is painted that is what I want in my great what millennium that is how coming I want Adams and if because Adam never leave it as in you now I'm gonna bring note on one Adam many Adams and many ifs and put them on Earth from one thousand year to prove the devil that there will be an Adam and Eve you won't do anything back on up we're going to the airport he said this there you are but you can't take them now you can go to working on them but you can take them till I can care I can call your hand and then in the great Resurrection then we will come forth everything that death did to us it is finish at death and then when we wake up to a new laugh wouldn't that be wonderful all the water gray hair is water gone the old Edge Water moved away and we won't be armed forever please forever in the beauty of the Lord and never have to be half sick never have to be helped oh never have to take what medicine never be in the water Hospital won't that be wonderful everybody okay everybody okay when you come forth in the resurrection you are not going to be one thing that symbols is what sin you growed you become at your what best I think science claim between 20 and what 23 that you are at your Peak after that you start dying So Adam was at a certain age when death struck him he started everybody okay God gets the picture up marries you remember we marry Abram Adam put you together like the first Adam and what is and give you a choice almost then I land the ship when you was about 16 or 20 you was around your best I guess it was about how 20 and what 21 and I think the cell which is their best so the age Adam was created was the limit that death cannot touch almost say there is the whole plan laying right there how God created me in the water beginning I come down here on Earth taking my place as the gospel preacher as you as a man or a woman with water salvation We Live the Life by the water grace of God hallelujah and that same great spirit here that was back Yonder in the water beginning it shall go back to the conscience of knowing I'll be there Hallelujah and then wait there under the water alter blessed house forever in what and then when returning back I will take up my body it's very big of water before death ever probably last one let's see how bad now here is the Glorious part on the return of Jesus at the resurrection he won't be that body that body then that supernatural being that God created in the beginning that will return to the Earth to get another body not born of a what woman Adam but created by God to never get what oh or have what wrinkles never have a water go ahead on your head but be how perfect how forever hallelujah oh brother that will make me shout on a hard night that's right this rub of Flesh will do what job and rise and seize the what Everlasting price what in the world we got to worry about [Applause] what in the world do you have to worry about everybody okay everybody okay let me stop here because time is gone everybody okay let me stop here time is gone but remember now how many body do we have we have Celestial body call to your funny we have caressed your body or Earthly body and we have glorified body the glory of celestial is one but we have limitation you cannot eat you cannot drink the terrestrial have a glory but he gets limitation you can
