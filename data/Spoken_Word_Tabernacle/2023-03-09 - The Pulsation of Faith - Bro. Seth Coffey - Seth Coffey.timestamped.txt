[40:00] the beautiful city of God
[40:04] Hallelujah
[40:07] you know there are two cities of God
[40:09] right
[40:12] do you know there are two cities of God
[40:15] that's fine just hang on tight you will
[40:19] see how many cities of God we have amen
[40:23] just be patient everything will be okay
[40:25] and when you will discover one of the
[40:27] city you'll be amazed like wow I didn't
[40:31] know this was a city of God Amen so at
[40:35] least when I throw a seeds like this is
[40:37] gonna
[40:38] pull a thirst on you and somebody will
[40:40] go start searching and reading the
[40:43] prophet which is going to be good amen
[40:45] how many understood the thoughts
[40:49] and the theophany and the word
[40:52] amen
[40:53] is it clear now
[40:55] or somebody still have questions
[40:58] clear
[41:01] praise God if you didn't get it clear
[41:04] you need to review it because on Sunday
[41:06] we will dig again deeper than that amen
[41:09] I tried to pull forward the Holy Spirit
[41:12] to won't let me
[41:13] and I have to stop where I stop by God's
[41:16] grace everything is good there are some
[41:19] deep deep very deep channels
[41:23] into this subject amen because if it's
[41:26] not handled properly you will lock
[41:29] people
[41:30] because of the mistake of their great
[41:33] grandfather
[41:35] or the father
[41:37] or somebody made a mistake and you send
[41:40] people to hell
[41:42] because you don't know how to handle
[41:44] stuff amen this message is precious but
[41:47] it need to be handled by the spirit of
[41:49] the message which is the holy spirit
[41:51] amen if not you're going to pull
[41:54] somebody and put him in hell when they
[41:56] are seed of God so there are certain
[41:58] things that are very very deep very very
[42:02] deep and I tried to lower some of them
[42:06] but I can't I have to read the whole
[42:08] thing the way brother Brandon put it in
[42:10] because it's going to free somebody
[42:13] a man is going to free you completely
[42:16] just the word you will know the truth
[42:18] and the truth will set you free amen
[42:21] there are children of God that have been
[42:23] bound
[42:24] amen
[42:26] do you think the people that made the
[42:28] error in marriage and divorce are only
[42:30] serpent seed
[42:32] there is a bunch of children of God that
[42:34] are bound into it so how is God going to
[42:37] Freedom
[42:39] amen because one way is armenianism and
[42:43] the other way is Calvinism
[42:45] the armenianists want to send everybody
[42:47] to hell but then
[42:50] and the Calvinists want to get everybody
[42:52] to Heaven even the Devil Himself
[42:57] amen so let's find out the real middle
[43:01] where the message is and tried to pull
[43:04] it so it's very deep some of them are
[43:06] very serious that's why I have to go
[43:09] slowly slowly to make sure the truth
[43:12] touches your heart and it sets you
[43:15] completely free and you will understand
[43:17] what is the baptism of the Holy Spirit
[43:19] now I know you're already getting it now
[43:21] clear why do you need to be born again
[43:25] amen then you will see everything we
[43:28] went through Ezekiel the new heart the
[43:30] new spirit and everything will blend on
[43:32] together so that has been said you need
[43:35] to pray for me
[43:37] amen they have the many strong
[43:40] statements if I give you one you will go
[43:42] home thinking twice like what is going
[43:44] on so you pray for me so we stay really
[43:47] really in deep prayer because it's
[43:50] really deep Channel but once we grasp it
[43:52] it will free you completely you don't
[43:54] even need for me to lay hand on you
[43:56] where you are when you just see it
[43:58] completely the devil begin to get off
[44:01] from you like oh somebody's awake and I
[44:04] need to get away from it amen that's the
[44:07] Deliverance it's the Deliverance of the
[44:09] Soul once it touches you Satan will know
[44:12] the body you can have it the Pentecost
[44:15] will have it all the time amen it
[44:18] doesn't scare the devil when your soul
[44:21] is awakened
[44:23] the devil knows
[44:26] and in heaven Jesus said there is joy in
[44:29] heaven when only one of them one of the
[44:32] sin have repented there is a joy there
[44:36] is a fist in heaven when one of the sin
[44:38] have repented amen
[44:41] I believe you receive uh the message for
[44:44] this coming Saturday at four o'clock
[44:46] amen if you think your schedule is busy
[44:49] mine is more busier than you
[44:52] amen because I have to do this on
[44:54] Saturday and I have to preach on Sunday
[44:56] so I don't know when I'm gonna sleep so
[44:59] you pray for me if you can by the grace

[53:18] and forever amen amen it's so good to
[53:21] see you this evening I'm so glad to be
[53:23] here
[53:24] um just consider it a privilege and
[53:25] honor I really appreciate that song I
[53:28] was speaking to the Lord before I came
[53:30] and I said Lord I would really love for
[53:31] them to sing only believe before I
[53:33] preached so I was very thankful and if
[53:36] you remember that last time I was here
[53:37] we were preaching on the name of Jesus
[53:40] and and then I can't remember the exact
[53:42] song that you sing brother Stephen but
[53:44] you might have been there's power in the
[53:46] name of Jesus or something like that but
[53:47] it just lined up perfectly so we're so
[53:50] glad that the Lord is always on time and
[53:52] the Lord you know I think one thing that
[53:54] we we must realize about the Lord is is
[53:57] the Lord isn't just in today the Lord is
[53:59] in before the foundation of the world
[54:01] the lord knew everything that we would
[54:03] ever have need of the Lord knew what
[54:05] would be said tonight the Lord knows
[54:07] what we have need of tonight and you
[54:09] know it it's amazing to me because
[54:11] there's actually times in our life that
[54:13] we don't even know what we need
[54:15] but God always knows what we need and
[54:18] have need of amen amen amen so we're
[54:21] very thankful to be here and I told
[54:22] Brother Wayne Lawson if I remembered I'd
[54:24] say it he wanted I had to I called him
[54:26] today because I was looking for
[54:27] something and in the message and he told
[54:29] me to greet the church while I was here
[54:31] so brother Wayne Lawson says hello to
[54:33] you and I'm not going to try to hold you
[54:35] long but I'm not good at keeping my
[54:36] promise but if you have your Bibles and
[54:39] we can turn to Hebrews the 11th chapter
[54:42] I'll try to get out of the way
[54:44] amen are you happy tonight
[54:46] amen
[54:48] I'm very very happy you're preaching on
[54:51] on music and all that different thing
[54:53] but I was sitting there going man does
[54:54] he really have to get out and say that
[54:55] stuff to the church and in correction
[54:57] and stuff before I have to come out and
[54:59] preach
[55:01] no that's a that's a great subject you
[55:04] know I mean it's amazing that you said
[55:06] that brother because it was just Sunday
[55:08] I think it was me and my wife we're
[55:10] talking about how you never really hear
[55:11] any ministering on music and and you
[55:14] know that's a that's something that I
[55:16] would like to to be a part of and hear
[55:18] as well we we got to make sure we're
[55:20] praising the right one
[55:21] and and with that being said tonight how
[55:24] you act towards this service will
[55:26] determine which one you're praising
[55:28] tonight when the word of God is going
[55:30] forth you have everybody has an
[55:32] opportunity to accept or reject the word
[55:35] of God and it's actually a sweet
[55:37] smelling it's a it's an incense coming
[55:39] up to God it's a praise there's nothing
[55:42] better to God than when you say Amen to
[55:44] the word of God God is always just
[55:46] looking for someone to believe his word
[55:49] amen amen we love you so Hebrews the
[55:52] 11th chapter and we'll begin with verse
[55:55] one and I believe the title that I I
[55:57] gave brother Stephen was the the
[55:59] pulsation of faith and and when we're
[56:02] going to look at that and maybe looking
[56:04] at the Unseen as well and that same
[56:06] thought now in verse 1 it says now Faith
[56:10] is the substance of things hoped for the
[56:12] evidence of Things Not Seen so it's
[56:15] something real but you really can't see
[56:17] it with these natural lies amen for by
[56:19] the elders obtained a good report
[56:21] through true faith we understand that
[56:24] the worlds were framed by the word of
[56:25] God so that things which are seen were
[56:28] not made of the things which do appear
[56:30] by faith Abel offered unto God a more
[56:34] excellent sacrifice than came by which
[56:36] he obtained witness that he was
[56:38] righteous God testifying of of his gifts
[56:41] and by it he being dead yet speaketh by
[56:44] faith Enoch was translated we're
[56:47] starting to see that face a pretty
[56:48] important thing that he should not see
[56:50] death and he was not found because God
[56:53] had translated him before his
[56:55] translation he had this testimony that
[56:58] he pleased God how did he please God by
[57:01] faith amen but without faith it is
[57:04] impossible to please him for he that
[57:07] cometh to God must believe that he is
[57:09] not he was not he will be he is and that
[57:14] he is a rewarder of them that diligently
[57:16] seek Him by faith Noah being warned of
[57:19] God of Things Not Seen as yet moved with
[57:23] fear prepared an art to the saving of
[57:25] his house by the which he condemned the
[57:28] world and became heir of righteousness
[57:30] which is by Faith by faith Abraham when
[57:34] he was called out into a place which he
[57:37] should after receive for an inheritance
[57:39] obeyed he went out not knowing whether
[57:42] he went by faith he sojourned in the
[57:45] land of promise as in a strange country
[57:47] dwelling in Tabernacles with Isaac and
[57:50] Jacob The Heirs with him of the same
[57:52] promise for he looked for a city which
[57:56] hath foundations whose Builder and maker
[57:59] is God he couldn't see it but he was
[58:01] looking for it and he knew it was there
[58:03] though through faith also Sarah herself
[58:06] received strength conceived seed and was
[58:09] delivered of a child when she was past
[58:12] age because she judged remember I told
[58:15] you you're judging something this
[58:16] evening judged him faithful who had
[58:18] promised therefore spring therefore even
[58:20] of the one in him as good as dead so
[58:25] many as the stars of the sky in the
[58:28] multitude and as the sand which is upon
[58:30] the seashore innumerable
[58:33] these all died in the faith not yet
[58:36] having received the promises but have
[58:39] seen them afar off and were persuaded of
[58:42] them church I want to say this they
[58:45] didn't see the message of the hour that
[58:46] we seen they didn't see the certain
[58:48] things that we sing that should increase
[58:50] I say if they can believe that how much
[58:52] more should we be able to believe with
[58:55] the things that we have seen and embrace
[58:57] them and confess that they were
[58:59] strangers and pilgrims on the earth for
[59:02] they that say for they that say such
[59:05] things declare plainly that they seek a
[59:07] country and truly if they had been
[59:09] mindful of that country from whence they
[59:12] came out of they might have had
[59:14] opportunities to have returned but now
[59:17] they desire a better country that isn't
[59:20] that is Heavenly wherefore God is not
[59:23] ashamed to be called they're gone
[59:24] forever prepared for them a city by
[59:28] faith Abraham when he was tried offered
[59:30] up Isaac I know this is a long reading
[59:32] but you're all right amen and he that
[59:35] had received the promise offered up his
[59:37] only begotten son of whom it was said
[59:39] that in Isaac shall all thy seed be
[59:42] called accounting that God was able to
[59:45] raise him up even from the dead from
[59:48] whence he from also he received him in a
[59:51] figure by faith Isaac blessed Jacob and
[59:54] Esau concerning the things that come by
[59:57] faith Jacob when he was a dying blessed
[59:59] both the sons of Joseph and worshiped
[1:00:02] leaning leaning upon the top of his
[1:00:04] staff by faith Joseph when he died made
[1:00:07] mention of the departing of the children
[1:00:10] of Israel so Joseph didn't see this but
[1:00:13] he believed it
[1:00:15] concerning gave commandment concerning
[1:00:18] his bones by faith Moses when he was
[1:00:20] born was hit three months of his parents
[1:00:22] because they saw he was a proper child
[1:00:25] and they were not afraid of the king's
[1:00:28] commandment by faith Moses when he was
[1:00:31] come to years refused to be called the
[1:00:34] son of Pharaoh's daughter choosing
[1:00:36] rather to suffer the afflictions with
[1:00:38] the people of God than to enjoy the
[1:00:41] pleasures of sin for a season esteeming
[1:00:43] the reproach of Christ greater riches
[1:00:45] than the treasures in Egypt for he had
[1:00:48] respect unto the recompense of the
[1:00:50] reward by faith he forsooked Egypt not
[1:00:53] fearing the Wrath of the king for he
[1:00:56] endured as seeing him who is invisible
[1:00:59] through faith he kept the Passover and
[1:01:03] the sprinkling of blood lest he that
[1:01:05] destroyed the firstborn should touch
[1:01:07] them by faith they passed through the
[1:01:09] Red Sea as dry land which the Egyptians
[1:01:12] are saying to do were drown by faith the
[1:01:16] walls of Jericho fell down after they
[1:01:19] were compressed come past seven days by
[1:01:23] faith the Harlot Rahab perished not with
[1:01:26] them that believe not when she had
[1:01:28] received the spies with peace and what
[1:01:31] shall I what more shall I say
[1:01:34] for the time would fail me to tell of
[1:01:37] Gideon and of Moroccan of the Samson and
[1:01:41] I can't pronounce that
[1:01:43] and David also in Samuel and of the
[1:01:46] prophets now listen who through faith
[1:01:50] subdue kingdoms
[1:01:52] wrought righteousness
[1:01:54] obtain promises
[1:01:56] and stopped the mouth of lions Amen Let

[1:05:42] temporal thing I'm going to make it
[1:05:43] through it I'm an eternal creature this
[1:05:46] time element cannot stop me
[1:05:50] we're talking on the pulsation of Faith
[1:05:52] now brother Brandon he would tell the
[1:05:54] story in looking at the Unseen of the TV
[1:05:57] salesman and that TV salesman would say
[1:05:59] I only believe in science and things
[1:06:01] that can be scientifically proven those
[1:06:03] are the things that are real and brother
[1:06:05] Branham says I hate to disagree with you
[1:06:07] but the only thing that Israel is that
[1:06:09] which cannot be scientifically proven he
[1:06:12] said what are you saying he said well
[1:06:13] I'll tell you what you believe in love
[1:06:15] don't you said yes well why don't you go
[1:06:16] buy me a quarter's worth of love
[1:06:18] he said you believe it's real right but
[1:06:21] you can't see it right but it's still
[1:06:22] real and that man he would begin to talk
[1:06:24] to him and they would begin to go back
[1:06:26] and forth and he would say see this TV
[1:06:28] right here he said as a control tower in
[1:06:31] it it has a receptor as a sender and a
[1:06:34] receiving station in it and brother
[1:06:36] random said he said but we can prove it
[1:06:38] because here's the picture showing that
[1:06:39] it's over there oh Hallelujah I love how
[1:06:42] brother Brandon said TV's been here as
[1:06:44] long as the world's began we're just now
[1:06:46] just Covenant if I could say it this way
[1:06:48] without being sounding sacrilegious
[1:06:50] Abraham discovered TV a long time before
[1:06:52] that you say what do you mean he was
[1:06:54] already looking for a city whose Builder
[1:06:57] and maker was God he didn't see it yet
[1:06:59] but he knew it was there what was it
[1:07:01] there was waves going back and forth
[1:07:03] through the air that was then you know
[1:07:05] what there was in Abraham there was a
[1:07:08] receiving station on the inside of
[1:07:10] Abraham see there was a sending station
[1:07:12] but there also has to be a receiving
[1:07:14] station you say what do you mean brother
[1:07:16] well let's look back in the Garden of
[1:07:17] Eden for a second when Cain and Abel
[1:07:20] would begin to make their sacrifices and
[1:07:22] God would be pleased with able sacrifice
[1:07:25] why Abel they didn't know they begin to
[1:07:27] look Adam and Eve begin to look at Abel
[1:07:30] and said who told him
[1:07:32] why is he bringing that lamb down
[1:07:34] through there
[1:07:35] here's Cain dressing everything up
[1:07:38] this is what your pastor is talking
[1:07:40] about be careful what your music you
[1:07:41] listen to he begins to make this
[1:07:43] beautiful beautiful stage this beautiful
[1:07:46] platform but you know what there wasn't
[1:07:48] no blood in it there wasn't no sacrifice
[1:07:51] for his sins in it and Adam and Eve
[1:07:53] would begin to go who told him that who
[1:07:56] told Abel that but you know what Abel
[1:07:58] had a receiving station on the inside of
[1:08:01] him that he could say this is the way
[1:08:03] back but God would come and speak lip to
[1:08:06] ear to Cain
[1:08:08] and he said just do as your brother does
[1:08:10] but you see he was on the wrong Channel
[1:08:12] you ever have a radio and you want to
[1:08:14] listen to a certain station but you
[1:08:16] can't you can't you can't zoom in over
[1:08:19] here on this station and listen to this
[1:08:21] station you got to be on the right
[1:08:22] Channel
[1:08:25] I said yes we can prove it too for in
[1:08:27] glory we've got a risen savior who sends
[1:08:30] it forth in the Holy Ghost reveals it
[1:08:33] and makes it positive therefore we got a
[1:08:35] sending station and a receiving station
[1:08:40] brother Branham says you know what that
[1:08:41] station says he says it says those
[1:08:43] things which are impossible are possible
[1:08:46] hey man brother Branham says every
[1:08:49] born-again child tonight comes through
[1:08:51] Abraham's blessing
[1:08:54] for it's the promise given to Abraham
[1:08:57] and every child of God that receives the
[1:09:00] Holy Spirit his pulsation is the same
[1:09:04] I'm looking for a city he said it isn't
[1:09:08] Los Angeles it isn't New York it isn't
[1:09:10] Louisville it's heaven and we confess
[1:09:13] that we are A peculiar people strangers
[1:09:17] because we're looking for something that
[1:09:19] we do not see but something on the
[1:09:23] control tower says it's there every
[1:09:26] church every
[1:09:29] every
[1:09:30] Redemptive blessing between here and
[1:09:33] there God promised to give it to us and
[1:09:36] we're walking we're pilgrims I don't
[1:09:39] care what so and so says I know
[1:09:42] something in me tells me it's real
[1:09:45] it's real
[1:09:47] something begins to pull Satan your
[1:09:49] bosom that says it's the truth
[1:09:51] what do you think that is raising up on
[1:09:53] the inside of you tonight
[1:09:55] it's a control tower
[1:09:57] then make ready you're coming out of
[1:09:59] there just as certain as I stand In This
[1:10:01] Moment to not poop it tonight don't look
[1:10:03] at what you see
[1:10:05] how bad I'm crippled how sick I am what
[1:10:08] the doctor said don't look at that look
[1:10:10] at the Unseen what God said before you
[1:10:13] feel any different before the pain
[1:10:15] leaves before the hand moves before the
[1:10:17] eye can see one sight
[1:10:19] get me yet make ready for it it's going
[1:10:23] to come as long as that pulsation begins
[1:10:26] to rise in your bosom in your heart
[1:10:29] where God sits on the control tower he
[1:10:32] said now this is where I get religious
[1:10:33] about this time and I think that the
[1:10:36] Holy Spirit can lead man and tell him
[1:10:40] things and make him act different and
[1:10:42] make him believe things and receive
[1:10:44] things that the world never could
[1:10:47] believe could happen
[1:10:49] there's something on the inside of us
[1:10:52] that when the world says you're crazy
[1:10:54] the world says you're losing your mind
[1:10:56] there's something on the inside of it
[1:10:58] that says I can't help but believe it
[1:11:02] I just want to say this before I go any
[1:11:04] further and I don't know why I feel like
[1:11:05] but I want to say I want you to realize
[1:11:07] something tonight you might have had a
[1:11:09] lot of problems you might have had a lot
[1:11:11] of struggles but guess what you're still
[1:11:13] here
[1:11:15] I've had every excuse in the world that
[1:11:17] I can think of to walk away from this
[1:11:21] I've been through false Doctrine I've
[1:11:23] been through churches that fell apart
[1:11:25] [Music]
[1:11:26] come on I've had family problems
[1:11:30] but you know what there's something on
[1:11:32] the inside of me that just keeps
[1:11:34] pulsating and Paul says and it says but
[1:11:37] I'm looking for a city
[1:11:39] it doesn't matter what comes in my way
[1:11:41] there's still a city there's still a
[1:11:44] city
[1:11:46] how many knows there's a city called
[1:11:48] Charlotte North Carolina
[1:11:50] not too far from it but you can't see it
[1:11:52] from right here but it's there
[1:11:55] you know what I'm sorry because Erica
[1:11:57] there could be someone you might never
[1:11:58] see it you have a visitor come in town
[1:12:00] but you have a revelation you've seen
[1:12:03] Charlotte North Carolina before
[1:12:05] and you begin to tell them it's there
[1:12:08] and that's how it is when the Holy
[1:12:10] Spirit begins to reveal some to our
[1:12:12] hearts we know there's a Charlotte North
[1:12:14] Carolina I can't see it right now but
[1:12:16] it's there and I'll tell you there is a
[1:12:18] Heaven There is a risen savior
[1:12:22] his name is Jesus Christ you say Seth
[1:12:25] have you ever seen him no not like that
[1:12:27] but I'll tell you what I've seen him in
[1:12:29] the power of his resurrection I've seen
[1:12:32] him move in a service before I've been
[1:12:34] standing there when I feel his presence
[1:12:36] come by and bump into me and encourage
[1:12:38] me
[1:12:40] we are the Seed of Abraham brother
[1:12:44] Branham said if you're a part of that
[1:12:45] seed that same pulsation runs through
[1:12:48] you Abraham out of Brethren himself what
[1:12:51] kind of seed was it he said it was a
[1:12:53] faith seed
[1:12:55] you wonder why you can't doubt you
[1:12:57] wonder why you can't give up you wonder
[1:12:59] why you don't give in how can you quit
[1:13:01] when you ain't got no quit in you
[1:13:04] you're not a quitter you're an overcomer
[1:13:07] to the overcomer
[1:13:10] when your name is in the Lamb's Book of
[1:13:12] Life not even you can take it out
[1:13:16] the devil can't take it out your mama
[1:13:18] can't take it out your daddy can't take
[1:13:20] it out the preacher can't take it out
[1:13:22] when it's in there
[1:13:24] Shield until the day of your Radiance
[1:13:28] you are sealed brother's sister when
[1:13:30] Satan gets there you're already filled
[1:13:32] we're the Seed of Abraham
[1:13:36] you say you really believe that even
[1:13:37] though you don't see it absolutely
[1:13:39] you're the Seed of Abraham what does
[1:13:41] that look like Sarah you feel any
[1:13:42] different no we got a promise
[1:13:45] [Music]
[1:13:46] [Applause]
[1:13:50] you say Seth coffee it looks worse than
[1:13:53] ever
[1:13:54] not be true with these eyes but I ain't
[1:13:56] looking through these eyes
[1:13:58] I hear something coming through the
[1:14:00] control tower saying I start to tune in
[1:14:03] I hear something going victory is mine
[1:14:06] victory is mine Victory today is mine
[1:14:12] I told Satan get thee behind before you
[1:14:18] know your foot starts tapping
[1:14:21] see this world ain't my home you know
[1:14:24] where I feel at home right here in
[1:14:26] Heavenly places in Christ Jesus this is
[1:14:28] the closest I get to home this is why I
[1:14:31] gotta be here and when things look wrong
[1:14:34] I stagger not at the promise of God
[1:14:38] I call those things which are not as
[1:14:40] though they were I'll sit here and I'll
[1:14:42] stand on the word of God why something
[1:14:45] in me
[1:14:47] if you can ever figure out it ain't you
[1:14:49] holding yourself you're gonna get
[1:14:50] somewhere with God
[1:14:52] when you can realize that it ain't your
[1:14:54] hand
[1:14:56] brother random said I ain't holding on
[1:14:58] to him but as long as he's old known to
[1:15:00] me I can have confidence
[1:15:03] [Applause]
[1:15:05] seat of Abraham
[1:15:07] [Applause]
[1:15:08] you say it looks bad you don't think it
[1:15:10] looked bad every single year that went
[1:15:13] by the Abraham The Fanatic that kept
[1:15:15] saying he's going to take a body change
[1:15:16] and have a son kept getting older and
[1:15:18] older and older you don't think Noah
[1:15:20] looked like a fanatic when he was
[1:15:21] building an ark in the rain never been a
[1:15:23] drop of rain but he wasn't looking at
[1:15:25] that he was looking at a city
[1:15:27] he was looking at a city whose Builder
[1:15:29] and maker was God
[1:15:32] funny
[1:15:34] how these men
[1:15:36] would act the same
[1:15:39] would do the most ridiculous things to
[1:15:41] the human eye
[1:15:43] were you man
[1:15:45] Abraham
[1:15:48] I'm sorry we ever doubted you Abraham
[1:15:50] now that you've got Isaac
[1:15:51] I I we really shouldn't have doubted you
[1:15:54] and man you're looking better than ever
[1:15:56] I tell you what you done took that body
[1:15:58] change you look awesome where are you
[1:16:00] how's it going anywhere anyways I'm
[1:16:02] going up the mountain to kill him
[1:16:05] you're doing what to Isaac God told me
[1:16:07] to go sacrifice him up on her on the
[1:16:09] mountain
[1:16:10] and you're gonna go up there and kill
[1:16:11] him God told me to
[1:16:14] you say what are you talking about does
[1:16:16] that not sound like the craziest thing
[1:16:18] you ever heard but here's the thing
[1:16:20] Abraham wasn't relying as on his own
[1:16:22] ability Abraham wasn't reliable about
[1:16:24] how he was feeling about it
[1:16:26] surely Isaac's looking around going
[1:16:28] where's the lamb
[1:16:30] and they start going up there and the
[1:16:32] willingness I love the type I'm going to
[1:16:34] tell you what if my daddy had a knife
[1:16:36] and we were going up a hill and I know
[1:16:37] there was no sacrifice I'm probably
[1:16:38] running back down the hill
[1:16:40] but he begins to walk up there with
[1:16:43] Isaac and you know Isaac is the type of
[1:16:44] Christ and he's sitting there and he
[1:16:47] says whatever makes my father happy I'm
[1:16:49] willing to lay her why because the very
[1:16:51] Seed of Abraham was in Isaac but while
[1:16:53] he was laying there you see Abraham
[1:16:55] wasn't looking at the condition Abraham
[1:16:57] wasn't looking at what he had to do he
[1:16:59] was looking at the promise God done
[1:17:01] promise me Isaac
[1:17:03] Isaac I want to have a talk with you son
[1:17:06] God done promise through my seed we're
[1:17:09] going to be blessed it can't end with
[1:17:12] you
[1:17:13] if you die it's over so see Abraham had
[1:17:16] such a faith that he was looking beyond
[1:17:19] the curtain he was looking beyond what
[1:17:22] he could see and say even if he dies and
[1:17:24] he lays there God will have to raise him
[1:17:27] up
[1:17:27] [Applause]
[1:17:29] the faith
[1:17:33] we are the Seed of Abraham
[1:17:36] you know another Seed of Abraham because
[1:17:38] isn't
[1:17:39] your seed
[1:17:41] shall not maybe not if not probably not
[1:17:46] could shall possess the Gate of every
[1:17:50] each all every single one of your
[1:17:55] enemies plural
[1:17:57] [Music]
[1:17:58] you say why Seth are you as strong as
[1:18:01] those Gates know but greater is he that
[1:18:03] is in me than those Gates that are in
[1:18:05] the world
[1:18:06] [Applause]
[1:18:07] you see there was one time I I love this
[1:18:10] brother Brandon says look at Joshua look
[1:18:12] at Joshua before one rock ever come out
[1:18:16] of the building of the walls of Jericho
[1:18:17] Joshua walked around the wall shouting
[1:18:20] the victory
[1:18:28] these might be these stories might
[1:18:30] become common to us but can you imagine
[1:18:31] a man
[1:18:33] and these tall walls are racing chariots
[1:18:35] around he's sitting there going victory
[1:18:41] there's that fanatic again believing the
[1:18:43] message of the hours that was told to
[1:18:44] him victory
[1:18:47] victory
[1:18:49] he know the walls was coming down he
[1:18:51] armed his men and walked around and
[1:18:52] around and around Jericho for seven days
[1:18:55] in full armor because he was looking at
[1:18:57] the Unseen it was a promise God made he
[1:19:00] said how much can you walk around a
[1:19:02] wheelchair how much can you walk around
[1:19:04] the cancer how much can you walk around
[1:19:07] sin shouting the victory if you're sick
[1:19:10] tonight if you're going through
[1:19:12] something you need to go ahead and start
[1:19:14] saying I have the victory
[1:19:17] it was a promise God made
[1:19:21] how much can you walk around sin
[1:19:23] shedding the victory that God gives the
[1:19:25] promise when you can see him who is
[1:19:27] invisible when that pulsation comes into
[1:19:30] your heart and Begins the pulse say I'm
[1:19:32] the Lord who heals all thy disease when
[1:19:35] you can see that everything else weakens
[1:19:39] away Joshua looked at the Unseen he
[1:19:42] walked around the walls believing it
[1:19:44] would happen it all depends on what
[1:19:47] you're looking at so tonight I say what
[1:19:49] are you looking at
[1:19:51] what were you looking at when you came
[1:19:53] in this building were you looking at
[1:19:55] your circumstances were you looking at
[1:19:56] your family that wasn't in church were
[1:19:58] you looking at your problems were you
[1:19:59] looking at your sickness or were you
[1:20:01] looking at God were you looking at his
[1:20:03] promises were you looking at his word if
[1:20:05] you were looking the wrong way I'll tell
[1:20:07] you a little bride don't get out of Step
[1:20:10] began to look back at the word of God
[1:20:12] and say God's word is faithful and true
[1:20:15] and guess what it don't matter how you
[1:20:17] feel about it either it's still the
[1:20:19] truth
[1:20:20] I begin to imagine that you know we
[1:20:23] might be going through a lot of
[1:20:24] jericholes in this life and if I could
[1:20:25] say it this way I believe Satan and
[1:20:27] laodicea specializes in building
[1:20:29] jerichos
[1:20:31] I believe he absolutely specializes in
[1:20:34] building spiritual jerichos
[1:20:37] it's not just little problems anymore
[1:20:39] Church
[1:20:40] it's big problems
[1:20:43] it's problems so big that when you first
[1:20:45] see it you go ma
[1:20:52] 'am now that
[1:20:54] I'm a country boy now
[1:20:56] that was like when I seen the the Bass
[1:20:58] Pro Shops in Tennessee that giant
[1:21:00] pyramid
[1:21:01] I said that is a big bass pro shops
[1:21:04] and I was looking at thing and I said my
[1:21:06] how did they even build that
[1:21:08] how'd they even do that and that's the
[1:21:09] way it is spiritually with our problems
[1:21:12] we don't have these little problems
[1:21:13] anymore you know why because you're
[1:21:14] maturing as Christians you know what
[1:21:16] makes you stronger trials you know what
[1:21:18] makes you better trials listen you don't
[1:21:21] get strong by rejoicing on the mountain
[1:21:22] you get strung by climbing out of the
[1:21:24] valley onto the mouth
[1:21:25] and they begin to sit there and they
[1:21:27] begin to look at that and I imagine when
[1:21:30] he first walked up to it he said my
[1:21:33] but then he seen a man standing there he
[1:21:36] drew a sword
[1:21:37] he said are you for us or against us
[1:21:41] and he said I'm the captain
[1:21:42] you know he began to remember a promise
[1:21:45] as I was with Moses
[1:21:47] so shall I be with you I give you the
[1:21:50] land I give you the land I give you the
[1:21:53] land Joshua footsteps is possession you
[1:21:56] might not understand it you might not
[1:21:58] know why you're going through it you
[1:21:59] might not even understand the trial but
[1:22:00] you just walk around it and when you
[1:22:02] walk around it don't just admire it but
[1:22:04] begin to sing a little tune and begin to
[1:22:05] praise God and begin to say thank you
[1:22:07] God for the victory
[1:22:09] and you know what you might have become
[1:22:11] to a Jericho that's so big you got
[1:22:13] family trapped in there
[1:22:15] you might have a little Rahab trapped in
[1:22:17] there somewhere you might have a little
[1:22:19] family that don't believe the way that
[1:22:20] you do but you're believing that God
[1:22:22] will bring them out you're believing
[1:22:24] that God will make a way for them you

[1:32:34] our confession
[1:32:37] if these people here in these
[1:32:39] Wheelchairs and these cots and knew that
[1:32:41] sick to die if you could just hear the
[1:32:43] word of God tonight don't try to figure
[1:32:46] it out
[1:32:49] don't think how long you've been sitting
[1:32:51] how long you've been sick think about
[1:32:54] what God Said and there comes a
[1:32:56] pulsation from the Holy Spirit In Your
[1:32:58] Heart saying it's the truth how do you
[1:33:00] know it's the truth said the devil I
[1:33:02] know it's the truth it's God's word it's
[1:33:04] the truth something begins to pull Satan
[1:33:07] you're abusing that it's the truth then
[1:33:09] make ready you're coming out of there
[1:33:12] you should be able to Rejoice tonight if
[1:33:15] there is something inside of your heart
[1:33:16] that when the word of God has gone forth
[1:33:19] there is something Paul Satan inside of
[1:33:21] you saying that's the truth and you know
[1:33:23] before you know it you're that's the
[1:33:25] truth begins to get louder or amen
[1:33:27] begins to get louder why because Faith
[1:33:30] cometh by hearing and hearing the word
[1:33:31] faith there's that word again Faith
[1:33:34] cometh by hearing hearing of the word of
[1:33:36] God just as certain as I've seen in this
[1:33:38] movement and I don't look at what you
[1:33:40] see how bad I'm crippled how sick I am
[1:33:42] what the doctor said don't look at that
[1:33:43] look at the Unseen what God said before
[1:33:45] you feel any different before the pain
[1:33:47] leaves before the hand moves before the
[1:33:49] eye can see one sight make ready for it
[1:33:53] it's going to come
[1:34:00] you know
[1:34:01] Philippine says I'm told by aviators who
[1:34:04] fly these here real fast jet planes and
[1:34:06] they say that the plane getting up to a
[1:34:08] certain speed that it vibrates and
[1:34:10] Shakes and it seems like the bolts is
[1:34:12] going to fly out of it the wings are
[1:34:14] going to come off until they pass that
[1:34:16] sound barrier but after they once passed
[1:34:19] that sound barrier the plane begins just
[1:34:21] sails out just in the ease when it
[1:34:24] passes the sound barrier the obstacle
[1:34:26] that's in its way of the plane when it
[1:34:27] passes its own sound can I say if we
[1:34:30] could ever get past our own complaining
[1:34:34] when it passes its own sound and then
[1:34:36] runs at ease oh if the Church of this
[1:34:39] day could ever pray till they pass the
[1:34:42] sin barrier and the unbelief barrier
[1:34:44] they could shout the victory of the
[1:34:46] Living God when they once passed that
[1:34:48] barrier by looking at the Unseen and
[1:34:50] letting the world vibrate and do what it
[1:34:53] wants to but there is a living God and
[1:34:56] we when we lose our disbelief and our
[1:34:58] unbelief in him and pass that place the
[1:35:01] world is saying the days of Miracles has
[1:35:04] passed it makes you shake oh there's
[1:35:06] there's no such thing as the baptism of
[1:35:08] the Holy Ghost it makes you wonder but
[1:35:10] if you just look at the Unseen to the to
[1:35:14] to The God Who promised it for the
[1:35:16] promises unto you to your children and
[1:35:18] them that are far off even as many as
[1:35:20] the Lord Our God shall call if you'll
[1:35:23] look to the Blessed word that says Jesus
[1:35:25] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[1:35:29] forever turn your heads towards that
[1:35:31] press on until you pass that vibration
[1:35:34] past the unbelief barriers and sin bears
[1:35:37] and all the Bears that seem to hinder
[1:35:40] you
[1:35:40] then you'll file you'll fly free in the
[1:35:43] faith of God knowing that all things are
[1:35:46] possible
[1:35:47] Church
[1:35:49] we ain't never going to get anywhere off
[1:35:51] the ground with these weights all over
[1:35:52] us we ain't never going to be able to
[1:35:54] hit the speed that we can hit if we're
[1:35:56] not willing to let go of all this sin
[1:35:58] that we have in our hands and all that
[1:36:00] thank the devil said oh you're just born
[1:36:01] with that that's just your trial you'll
[1:36:03] deal with that for the rest of your life
[1:36:05] no you ain't got to you're the Seed of
[1:36:07] Abraham you don't have to look at that
[1:36:09] you can look at something different You
[1:36:11] Were Made to Fly
[1:36:12] You Were Made to Fly Above All of it all
[1:36:16] the pain all the heartache all the
[1:36:18] things you're going through You're Made
[1:36:20] to Fly Above It
[1:36:22] you ain't a maid to be sitting down here
[1:36:25] in the storm when you can be above the
[1:36:27] storm church one time I was coming back
[1:36:29] from Texas on an airplane and it was
[1:36:31] beautiful weather and we got to
[1:36:33] Charlotte and we dropped below the
[1:36:34] clouds and it was nothing but rain and
[1:36:36] storms and everything else and I was
[1:36:39] sitting there thinking glory to God even
[1:36:41] though I'm right here right now I know
[1:36:43] just beyond those clouds the sun is
[1:36:46] still shining I know just beyond those
[1:36:48] clouds when I seen that sun his mercies
[1:36:51] were new today we gotta look beyond our
[1:36:54] problems
[1:36:55] I couldn't see the Sun but it was there
[1:36:58] it was there
[1:37:02] you ain't made to be tied down
[1:37:04] Philippines had an eagle is made to get
[1:37:07] above that storm he's made to shed his
[1:37:10] wings and fly effortlessly it's already
[1:37:13] in you to do it you don't have to work
[1:37:16] it up you just have to believe God you
[1:37:19] just have to say God is your word
[1:37:24] you know when we were kids I'm still a
[1:37:26] kid but when we were little kids you
[1:37:28] know remember when the June bugs came in
[1:37:31] and those June bugs were made to fly but
[1:37:34] us evil kids we would take them and we
[1:37:36] would tie a string to them and they
[1:37:38] would try to take off and we'd have a
[1:37:40] string on them
[1:37:42] and you know that June bug Was Made to
[1:37:44] Fly but as long as there was weights
[1:37:46] attached to him I remember I had this
[1:37:48] one all day at my grandma's house
[1:37:50] watching it fly back and forth like it
[1:37:52] was a little kite you know
[1:37:54] and I'm sitting there and that he was
[1:37:55] determined to fly
[1:37:57] he was made to fly he didn't walk away
[1:38:00] from me he wanted to fly away from me
[1:38:02] but as long as that weight was on him
[1:38:07] he couldn't go more than three feet from
[1:38:08] me
[1:38:10] but at the end of the day
[1:38:13] my grandma said set those things free
[1:38:17] you know we had that thing on there
[1:38:19] and I cut that string
[1:38:23] you know why he was made for that
[1:38:26] he was built to fly but as long as these
[1:38:29] weights were on him and listen that
[1:38:30] wasn't his fault
[1:38:32] it wasn't his fault that somebody came
[1:38:34] around and tied a string on him and
[1:38:36] listen you might be born with this
[1:38:38] nature you might be born in this flesh
[1:38:41] you might be born to a place where
[1:38:43] you're bogged down but you ain't got to
[1:38:45] stay that way that's why God made a new
[1:38:48] birth
[1:38:49] so you can be born again that you can
[1:38:52] fly above that you don't want that very
[1:38:53] scripture
[1:38:54] it said they weren't able to obtain the
[1:38:57] promise they without us cannot be made
[1:39:00] perfect

[1:41:04] problem we'll never see the problem
[1:41:06] solver

[1:42:07] I don't know about y'all but I ain't no
[1:42:09] Loser tonight
[1:42:10] I'm a winner I'm a hand pick overcoming
[1:42:15] son of the most high God Satan don't
[1:42:18] believe it people don't believe it but I
[1:42:20] believe it because the faith of Abraham
[1:42:23] is put on the inside of me it's on the
[1:42:26] inside of you tonight
[1:42:28] I tell you what church
[1:42:31] I'm feeling that atmosphere starts to
[1:42:34] change I'm feeling people begin to
[1:42:36] believe God
[1:42:38] blessed be the name of the Lord I tell
[1:42:40] you I don't know about y'all but I'm
[1:42:42] beginning to feel a charge bump into me
[1:42:44] every now and then it reminds me of the
[1:42:46] time when Elisha and gehaza we're
[1:42:49] standing there and the enemy might have
[1:42:50] came in the enemy might have been
[1:42:52] disrupted in your whole week your whole
[1:42:54] month your whole year
[1:42:56] the king of Syria might decide to make
[1:42:58] war against this Tabernacle
[1:43:01] but one thing the king of Syria don't
[1:43:03] know is God's in his bed chamber
[1:43:06] Hallelujah I wonder how many times Satan
[1:43:09] made a plan for this church
[1:43:11] how I'm going to destroy this church how
[1:43:14] I'm going to bring this church down but
[1:43:16] every time he would come in the house of
[1:43:18] God and make this wonderful plan to
[1:43:21] overthrow you here comes an evangelist a
[1:43:24] preacher that don't know nothing about
[1:43:26] you
[1:43:27] and Satan's going who told him
[1:43:30] which one of y'all told him the plan
[1:43:33] because God is in the enemy's bad
[1:43:35] chamber and I want you to know tonight
[1:43:38] you ain't alone fighting this battle
[1:43:41] you ain't alone finding this battle you
[1:43:44] felt that surge of energy you felt
[1:43:46] yourself bounce into something what is
[1:43:48] that that's angels all around us
[1:43:50] fighting the battle pushing out the
[1:43:53] enemy I say this tonight whose side are
[1:43:56] you on
[1:43:58] as Joshua said whose side are you on all
[1:44:02] I can tell you this my wife's back there
[1:44:04] for me and my house
[1:44:06] we're gonna serve the Lord
[1:44:10] you might not see them but the angels
[1:44:13] are here you might not see it but
[1:44:15] they're here
[1:44:16] Jesus said what are we going to do we're
[1:44:19] outnumbered the enemies all around
[1:44:21] Elijah said God open his eyes one time
[1:44:26] he began to open his eyes when he opened
[1:44:28] his eyes that didn't put the Angels
[1:44:30] there
[1:44:31] he just seen what was already there
[1:44:34] blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:44:40] I feel good now yes
[1:44:44] I feel that breakthrough now
[1:44:47] Hallelujah
[1:44:49] you know there was a sister just
[1:44:51] beginning of the year
[1:44:53] and she came up for prayer and we began
[1:44:55] to pray for her she came up to me and
[1:44:58] she said I've got arthritis all in my
[1:44:59] arms I said you do she said yeah I said
[1:45:02] well do you believe Jesus Christ is
[1:45:03] still the same yesterday today and
[1:45:05] forever do you believe that that same
[1:45:06] Jesus that raised Lazarus from the dead
[1:45:08] is still the Jesus right here in this
[1:45:10] church right now and she said absolutely
[1:45:12] I believe it and we begin to pray for
[1:45:14] her and blessed be the name of the Lord
[1:45:16] you know what she looked past you know
[1:45:18] what she was doing she was breaking past
[1:45:20] that arthritis barrier she was breaking
[1:45:23] past that unbelief barrier and she came
[1:45:25] out of that and she met me outside of
[1:45:27] that church she began to threw her arm
[1:45:29] up and down like this she said every bit
[1:45:31] of the pain has left me why because
[1:45:33] we're Abraham's see tonight
[1:45:35] where the Royal Seed of Abraham
[1:45:41] there's no cure for arthritis there's
[1:45:43] one
[1:45:45] there's no cure for cancer there's one
[1:45:48] Hallelujah there's no way that a
[1:45:50] wretched sinner like me can be saved
[1:45:52] there's one
[1:45:53] there's one mediator between God and man
[1:45:57] and his name is Christ Jesus there's one
[1:46:00] Healer
[1:46:01] there's one high priest that can be
[1:46:04] touched by the feeling of our
[1:46:06] infirmities Hallelujah
[1:46:09] whatever you're going through Jesus has
[1:46:12] done been through it
[1:46:13] [Music]
[1:46:14] however you're feeling Jesus already
[1:46:16] knows Jesus was talked about Jesus was
[1:46:20] thrown around Jesus was beat down Jesus
[1:46:22] was spitting his faith Jesus was hung on
[1:46:25] a cross and you know what he said it is
[1:46:28] finished
[1:46:31] that the life of God could come back on
[1:46:34] the believer
[1:46:35] [Applause]
[1:46:42] look around at your neighbor they
[1:46:44] weren't holding themselves
[1:46:46] the life of God came back on the
[1:46:48] believer
[1:46:49] we're over commerce tonight
[1:46:55] [Music]
[1:47:16] God already prepared this
[1:47:20] is my message to the church
[1:47:22] God's already prepared for this
[1:47:24] everyone
[1:47:29] listen
[1:47:31] before Satan was ever created
[1:47:34] and ever knew what was going on
[1:47:37] God already had a plan for this
[1:47:41] this day did not catch God by surprise
[1:47:44] tomorrow will not catch God by surprise
[1:47:48] but it will catch Satan by surprise
[1:47:54] why in the world
[1:47:57] did he call That Little Country Boy
[1:47:59] Can't hardly even read his Bible
[1:48:03] to come up there and he walked because
[1:48:06] it ain't me
[1:48:07] God has a plan
[1:48:09] I hope this is speaking to your heart
[1:48:11] tonight God
[1:48:12] can I tell you a little testimony
[1:48:15] and I'm going to try to close here
[1:48:16] shortly
[1:48:18] but you know there was one time where
[1:48:20] Stephen I had a sermon planned prepped
[1:48:23] ready to go
[1:48:24] we had figured it out I was before God
[1:48:28] and right before I went to sleep God
[1:48:31] said and I was going to preach on uh
[1:48:34] uh what was that no Abraham Lincoln gave
[1:48:36] pardon I was going to preach on a pardon
[1:48:40] and then right before I went to speak
[1:48:41] all God gave me was preach on
[1:48:44] uh preach on God Will Make A Way
[1:48:47] and I'm sitting there and I'm like well
[1:48:49] God you know I really studied all this
[1:48:51] out
[1:48:52] you know all my reasons why I can't do
[1:48:54] what God's telling me to do
[1:48:56] I hope it's all right for me just to be
[1:48:58] myself to y'all I love you y'all were
[1:49:01] like family to me
[1:49:02] I'm home I'm home
[1:49:06] and and you know it said God Will Make A
[1:49:08] Way so right before I go to sleep I get
[1:49:10] I get like one scripture and two quotes
[1:49:12] and I'm sitting there going well
[1:49:15] God's gonna have to make a way
[1:49:17] and and and and you know what it was
[1:49:19] though that night as soon as God told me
[1:49:22] that
[1:49:23] I I could I didn't see the sister but I
[1:49:26] felt and my wife's a witness of this I
[1:49:28] felt this sister's pain
[1:49:31] where she was trapped and she couldn't
[1:49:33] get out and I said she's tried and in my
[1:49:36] mind this is what was coming she's tried
[1:49:37] over and over to get out let her know
[1:49:39] there's a way
[1:49:40] and and I told my wife in the car on the
[1:49:42] way down there I told her that same
[1:49:43] thing I said now I don't claim I told
[1:49:46] her I said I don't claim to have
[1:49:47] discernment I don't claim those things I
[1:49:48] believe every holy ghost person has an
[1:49:50] amount of discernment in him
[1:49:53] but when you can when the when you have
[1:49:55] the control tower
[1:49:57] and it began to speak to my heart
[1:50:00] and and it began to say there's a sister
[1:50:02] down there
[1:50:03] if he feels trapped she feel like she
[1:50:06] can't get out and I said honey I just
[1:50:08] want to tell you this now so after it's
[1:50:10] done I'm you're going to be a witness of
[1:50:13] it that I just didn't say that when I
[1:50:15] was coming down here in church
[1:50:17] I went I went down there and we began to
[1:50:21] preach and you know at the end of that
[1:50:22] I'd be preaching on that way maker and
[1:50:25] we were sitting there and we were oh God
[1:50:27] would make a way and and then and then I
[1:50:29] was sitting there going man I wonder if
[1:50:30] I know that song way maker and at the
[1:50:32] end of the service they never even they
[1:50:34] talked about singing it two weeks ago
[1:50:35] but they never sang it and that was the
[1:50:37] very first time that they sing it in
[1:50:38] that church was way maker and then they
[1:50:40] began to sing that I could still go free
[1:50:42] and about that time this woman began to
[1:50:44] let out a shout
[1:50:48] what a tremendous service today
[1:50:50] she posted this after the service
[1:50:53] God was so real I can't let this
[1:50:55] opportunity go without giving a
[1:50:57] testimony for almost four years I have
[1:50:59] been battling something that not many
[1:51:01] people have known about
[1:51:02] it wasn't just depression and anxiety
[1:51:05] but it was different and I was tormented
[1:51:07] with this every single day at times I
[1:51:10] didn't I don't think at times I didn't
[1:51:12] think I had the strength to go on and I
[1:51:14] didn't think I'd ever break away from it
[1:51:16] well today I am free we were singing
[1:51:19] that I could still go free God came down
[1:51:21] and I literally felt it leave my body
[1:51:24] it's gone the devil didn't want me to
[1:51:27] make this post the power of confession
[1:51:30] the devil didn't want me to make this
[1:51:32] post but I'm sitting here shaking as I
[1:51:34] type it all out but he can't take away
[1:51:37] what he did for me I'm going to tell you
[1:51:40] what if I can encourage you with
[1:51:41] anything tonight if you're sick of that
[1:51:43] Spirit that's limiting your praise if
[1:51:45] you're sick of that that keeps holding
[1:51:47] you down you just remember he can't ever
[1:51:49] take away what God done for you
[1:51:52] gotta leave my body I didn't want to
[1:51:55] make this post I'm sitting here saying I
[1:51:56] type it all out he can't take away what
[1:51:59] he did for me he showed me today that he
[1:52:02] loves me and always has no amount of
[1:52:06] saying Thank You Lord will ever be
[1:52:08] enough truly is he is our way maker you
[1:52:12] don't know like what I know what he's
[1:52:15] done for me
[1:52:17] [Applause]
[1:52:18] I'm here to tell you tonight stop
[1:52:21] looking at those problems
[1:52:23] look at the promise
[1:52:29] I'm gonna read this and I'm gonna quit I
[1:52:31] promise
[1:52:33] [Music]
[1:52:35] well Brandon Begin to talk about John
[1:52:37] when he was in prison
[1:52:40] now when these disciples came to Jesus
[1:52:41] with this great
[1:52:43] prophet's message Jesus never said to
[1:52:45] them now I'll tell you what I'll do I'll
[1:52:46] send you some some literature to give to
[1:52:49] John on how to be happy in jail
[1:52:51] I love brother Brandon he never said
[1:52:54] that he didn't he didn't say I'll give
[1:52:55] you a book on patience and tell John how
[1:52:57] to be patient while he's in jail it's a
[1:53:01] good thing he said he's in jail I hate

[1:53:14] then you can leave after that just watch
[1:53:17] this afternoon's meeting and after Jesus
[1:53:20] had the meeting I'd imagine those
[1:53:21] Disciples of John sitting there watching
[1:53:23] every move he made because John had
[1:53:26] taught them what the Messiah was and
[1:53:30] told them what it was and these was his
[1:53:32] disciples and he began and they began to
[1:53:34] see what was what has taken place so
[1:53:37] then after the service was over then
[1:53:40] when those two disciples went back to
[1:53:41] John he said go tell John the lame walk
[1:53:44] the blind sea the deaf here and all that
[1:53:48] comes to the meeting is poor all the
[1:53:50] poor people got the gospel preached to
[1:53:53] them and tell John not to be scared

[1:55:12] you might go through trials
[1:55:14] you might go through tribulations
[1:55:16] but you know what
[1:55:18] that never changes that your son and
[1:55:20] daughter of God
[1:55:24] you should have battled was this for so
[1:55:26] long but listen God has a special
[1:55:28] service just for you
[1:55:39] you don't have to understand God you
[1:55:41] just have to trust him
[1:55:45] if you would like to come back to the
[1:55:47] music and close and I'll tell this there
[1:55:48] was a
[1:55:49] brother Branham tells a story and there
[1:55:51] was a woman
[1:55:53] that
[1:55:54] she
[1:55:56] she had this baby and its foot was
[1:55:57] tilted upwards and it couldn't never
[1:55:59] wear a pair of shoes
[1:56:02] and brother Branham said this woman came
[1:56:04] and and she had a parish she had to pair
[1:56:07] of shoes with her
[1:56:08] and she said I believe brother Branham
[1:56:10] if you just lay your hands on this baby
[1:56:16] he said and it'll be well and she went
[1:56:19] up to him and he said do you require a
[1:56:20] vision of me and she said no not a
[1:56:23] vision just lay your hands on it and the
[1:56:25] baby will be well
[1:56:27] well they took the baby after he laid
[1:56:29] his hands on it and nothing happened
[1:56:32] they came back later and said something
[1:56:33] was wrong
[1:56:35] something something something didn't go
[1:56:36] right brother Brown and he said no no no
[1:56:38] no no no
[1:56:40] you said you believed
[1:56:42] and he said and I'm paraphrasing here
[1:56:44] but brother Branham says in a quote he
[1:56:46] says the problem ain't with the word
[1:56:49] the problem ain't with God's promises
[1:56:52] the problem is with he said you
[1:56:58] see there ain't nothing wrong with God's
[1:56:59] word
[1:57:01] there ain't nothing wrong with his
[1:57:02] promises but she had in her mind how God
[1:57:04] should do it
[1:57:06] she had it figured out how God should do
[1:57:08] it and when she went up to God or when
[1:57:10] she went up to brother Branham he said
[1:57:12] no no there ain't nothing wrong you said
[1:57:14] you believed and he said she said can I
[1:57:17] just ask you one thing brother Branham
[1:57:18] and he said what is that do you believe
[1:57:20] it's God's will for my baby to be
[1:57:22] crippled and he said no I don't believe
[1:57:24] that and she said that's all I need

[1:57:29] offended in me and she went on believing
[1:57:33] listen church as far as I know it didn't
[1:57:35] happen the next day it didn't happen the
[1:57:37] day after that brother Brandon was
