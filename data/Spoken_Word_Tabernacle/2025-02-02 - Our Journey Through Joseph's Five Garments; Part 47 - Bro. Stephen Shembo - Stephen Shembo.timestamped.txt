[37:31] ringing that I know okay something is
[37:34] going on Amen if you don't love the
[37:36] voice of the Prophet something is wrong
[37:39] because at the voice of the seven Angel
[37:42] H when he shall begin to sound then all
[37:45] the mysteries of God should be revealed
[37:48] amen ah even your tape was created for
[37:51] that
[37:56] [Applause]
[37:59] you need to swallow this type of things
[38:01] because what is coming up might be too
[38:03] strong to swallow so just get some
[38:05] appetizer and say amen amen amen glory
[38:10] to God amen amen Lord's willing the
[38:13] young Sisters Meeting will be on
[38:15] February the
[38:17] 22nd the merried coule meeting is on
[38:20] March the 22 so 22nd 22nd Lord's willing
[38:25] and the young men meeting the next one
[38:27] one was pushing harder to get one
[38:30] quickly so if you can work it out
[38:33] brother Enoch you can work with the
[38:34] Deacon and see when we can do it and
[38:36] then we will pick up again on finances
[38:39] and the reason why I'm lingering with
[38:41] them like I told them yesterday I say
[38:43] you are men you are patriarch you are
[38:47] not women uh women I'm going with them a
[38:50] different direction but you are man you
[38:52] are going to be the head of the
[38:54] household and the sister are looking for
[38:56] true head
[38:58] amen so I'm tightening up with the man
[39:03] so please parent do not Len
[39:09] up I don't know if you get me very well
[39:12] in other word when I'm giving
[39:13] instruction to these children all my
[39:16] instruction are coming from the Bible
[39:18] and the message of the hour amen so when
[39:22] I tighten it don't lose in a home I told
[39:26] them and I and I and I dealt with a
[39:28] principle of the souls yesterday and I
[39:31] gave them I told them I'm going to tell
[39:32] you this for the rest of your life and I
[39:35] dealt with the principle of the souls
[39:37] about our own identification amen
[39:40] because God when he creat you the true
[39:42] you God put it in your
[39:44] soul are we together and your soul is
[39:48] wired by God to establish your true
[39:52] identity are we together that's why we
[39:54] should always speak from our heart
[39:58] that's it it I I don't know if we
[40:01] together when you speak don't speak from
[40:03] your head the head is a
[40:07] hypocrite the head is a
[40:09] compromiser always speak from your heart
[40:13] and I told them if you love the color
[40:15] red tell your friend I like red and you
[40:19] need to also let your friend tell you
[40:21] are like
[40:22] blue so if both of you know exactly what
[40:26] each other like like you will create a
[40:29] Baer Zone where each each person is
[40:33] respected but I do not believe in young
[40:35] man joking all the time am don't say
[40:40] amen amen I told them I do not believe
[40:44] the last one I mean the the the youngest
[40:46] one was 13 years old yesterday it was a
[40:50] I mean I mean a group of them the
[40:51] youngest one was 13 and I told them I
[40:54] say Jesus was a 12 years old not 13
[40:59] where did they find him with his peers
[41:01] with the people of his age they find him
[41:04] where with who they were of his age or
[41:09] above his
[41:10] age so I don't want any young man in
[41:13] this church to be a
[41:16] player father do you understand me Mama
[41:20] do you understand me young men should
[41:23] dress like
[41:24] men cut your hair correctly
[41:28] groom yourself correctly talk like a man
[41:32] behave like a man I do not believe in
[41:35] young men meeting and then just joking
[41:38] joking joking I told them when you meet
[41:40] among other young men from other
[41:42] churches cool down sit down and talk
[41:46] like a
[41:46] door you say this is what I find in life
[41:49] and this one say oh I learned something
[41:51] and this one said not young men because
[41:53] what we mean young men in the message it
[41:55] means just joking jumping and playing
[41:58] and tomorrow you going to marry
[42:02] someone no one the sister says no amen

[42:22] are we together amen men should behave
[42:25] like men amen

[42:33] that's their own foolishness not him
[42:35] spoken word right here I want to see
[42:38] young men on fire for
[42:41] God if they preach the gospel on fire

[59:27] the devil has got an old crow bait out
[59:30] there that's right I tell you the truth
[59:34] every time not
[59:36] sometime every time you see what a
[59:40] scarecrow up remember there is something
[59:43] good around
[59:44] [Applause]
[59:47] it when you see something in the
[59:50] Bible or a revelation of God that scares
[59:55] you uhhuh

[1:00:01] Revelation
[1:00:03] amen glory to God brother Bram say every

[1:00:21] pineapple or a mean Hedge Apple out
[1:00:24] there out here you get it under what the
[1:00:28] big sweet trees where you see the what
[1:00:32] scarecrow because they are wanting to
[1:00:34] scare away that's right so the purpose
[1:00:37] of a scarecrow is to get you away from

[1:00:45] together if there is something bad they
[1:00:47] won't put a scarecrow if they place a
[1:00:50] scarecrow it means that there is
[1:00:52] something good there but they don't want
[1:00:54] you to partake of it so you need to know
[1:00:56] how to decode
[1:00:59] scarecrows there is nothing in this
[1:01:01] Bible that you should be afraid of Amen

[1:52:43] that's where we stop last Sunday I want
[1:52:45] to remind you
[1:52:47] this according to John N the Bible says
[1:52:52] in verse 31 now we know that God here is
[1:52:56] not what sinners now
[1:52:59] remember what when the sacrifice is
[1:53:03] killed the blood is
[1:53:06] recuperated when they pick up the blood
[1:53:09] the blood is applied
[1:53:12] simultaneously in three area amen and
[1:53:15] remember where the blood is or where the
[1:53:18] blood goes that's where the problem is
[1:53:21] because the blood is going to atone or
[1:53:24] to remove what is bad over there if the
[1:53:28] blood struck the veil there is something
[1:53:31] wrong with the veil if the blood struck
[1:53:34] the Horn of the altar something is wrong
[1:53:36] in the altar if it goes to the bottom of
[1:53:39] the Brazen altar something is wrong
[1:53:42] there because the blood is the
[1:53:45] Clorox it chases where wrong is in order
[1:53:49] to bring atonement and to remove
[1:53:52] everything thing so that the blame that
[1:53:54] was laying there is completely removed
[1:53:58] so the highway can be unclog and the
[1:54:02] fire of the energy can pass through amen

[2:46:40] accessing the god-given right Lord but
[2:46:44] Lord the more we getting into this we
[2:46:47] begin to see the power of of the blood

[2:46:53] and how powerful is this blood that Lord
[2:46:56] father you open the holiest of holiest
[2:47:00] so that we can say and get into access
