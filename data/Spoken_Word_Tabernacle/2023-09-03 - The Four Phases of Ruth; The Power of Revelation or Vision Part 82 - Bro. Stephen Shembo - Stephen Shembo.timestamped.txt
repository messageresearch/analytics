[24:32] praise God Amen
[24:35] God bless you Saints I just wanted to
[24:37] give this testimony for the glory of God
[24:40] um first I want to thank him for another
[24:42] year of Life on August 10th I turned
[24:44] 29th and so grateful just to be on earth
[24:47] for another year but mostly to be able
[24:49] to be a child of God and a servant of
[24:51] God it's a privilege to be a Christian
[24:54] I just want to also thank him for um
[24:56] bringing me as far as he has I'm just
[24:58] continuously working and revealing
[25:00] himself to me all of us but I especially
[25:03] thank him just for the revelations that
[25:05] he's given me
[25:06] um I just wanted to let him know how
[25:08] grateful I am just for his leadership
[25:11] um I've been working at Hilton Garden in
[25:13] the hotel that we used to have church in
[25:16] and
[25:17] um I've been there for a year and a
[25:19] month maybe and I feel like I I caught a
[25:24] routine that the Lord has always done in
[25:26] my life when it comes to jobs most of
[25:28] the jobs that I've worked since I
[25:30] started working for the most part I
[25:33] always walk in and get the job I usually
[25:35] don't apply before getting the job and I
[25:37] never really realized that until this
[25:39] last time where he kind of dropped it in
[25:41] my my heart to say that I'm the one
[25:43] who's providing these opportunities for
[25:45] you it's not you
[25:47] um because you know sometimes you can
[25:48] think it's you know your personality or
[25:50] these things that that you get granted
[25:52] but when you have the Revelation that
[25:54] it's God that you know is in control of
[25:57] everything in your life then you can
[25:58] realize who's really orchestrating
[26:00] things so um I walked into
[26:03] um this just drop and now I can say what
[26:05] it was because I was keeping it hush
[26:06] because I was trying that approach where
[26:08] you keep it quiet until the Lord
[26:09] provides
[26:10] um but um when we're working as a sales
[26:13] expert for a mattress firm
[26:16] um so if you need Matt I'm joking I'm
[26:17] joking but
[26:20] um basically I walked into the job and
[26:21] the the manager you know she had a very
[26:24] pleasant demeanor about her and I was
[26:26] having trouble with Management in my
[26:28] last job but instead of getting upset uh
[26:30] well I actually was frustrated but
[26:32] instead of like acting on I was like you
[26:34] know what Lord you've always come
[26:35] through for me every single time I
[26:37] believe that you'll do the same so I
[26:39] don't need to worry about my bills I
[26:40] don't need to worry about anything and I
[26:41] didn't
[26:42] um and through the month of August
[26:44] though things were tight financially I
[26:48] was able or things were everything was
[26:50] covered all my bills everything through
[26:52] different means um the Lord provided and
[26:54] I was so so grateful because I was like
[26:56] I didn't know how I was going to do it
[26:59] um and then in between that that's when
[27:01] the job came and literally it was like
[27:03] just a transition all the bills are just
[27:05] covered right between I get into the
[27:07] next payroll and so I just wanted to
[27:09] give glory to God and encourage anybody
[27:11] who you know may be going through
[27:13] anything that you know if you just keep
[27:14] your mind on Christ you know he will
[27:16] provide and lastly on Wednesday brother
[27:18] Paul who preached everything that that
[27:21] brother was saying was everything that
[27:23] was contemplating on or I'm sorry not
[27:25] contemplating um
[27:27] um thinking on for the like the last two
[27:29] months three months you know just the
[27:30] Lord dealing with me about having faith
[27:32] and just believing and having the spoken
[27:34] word and that same approach in which I
[27:36] was taking I can see that he confirmed
[27:39] it for me once they say that you're on
[27:40] the right track and I just keep going in
[27:42] that direction and so I just wanted to
[27:43] thank the Lord for that this morning
[27:47] thank you
[27:49] Hallelujah
[27:57] amen
[28:04] all right God bless you thanks I first
[28:07] want to say thank you for your prayers
[28:09] amen I appreciate your prayers a lot so
[28:13] um I just wanted to give a testimony on
[28:15] how like everything actually like went
[28:17] like during the event
[28:20] um
[28:20] so I was in the TA section of the math
[28:24] and help center for my uh on for a math
[28:27] problem and like the TA guy he was like
[28:30] on his phone for a second and he like
[28:32] got like super like scared out of
[28:34] nowhere and I was like what is it what's
[28:36] wrong with him and he like was like okay
[28:38] we're gonna go
[28:39] and there was so it was me uh two girls
[28:43] I was Ill right there and there was two
[28:46] two or three girls I was at a table
[28:49] um across the room and then there was a
[28:51] guy in the back and another guy over
[28:53] here in the back and they just like got
[28:55] up and were leaving and so I was getting
[28:58] my stuff and the guy was like so scared
[29:01] it was like he's forgot he was in a
[29:03] leadership role he was like was leaving
[29:05] everybody and I was I was first I
[29:08] understand what's going on so I looked
[29:09] at my phone and it said it was an active
[29:11] shooter find shelter get away from
[29:13] Windows I was like okay
[29:15] so um I got my stuff and I realized he
[29:19] was leaving the two guys that were on in
[29:21] their headphones they had headphones on
[29:23] they were working so um I went to them
[29:25] and I calmly told them you know the
[29:27] situation I said I'd advise with the
[29:29] Packer things and leave and follow the
[29:32] group and um they said okay thank you
[29:34] very much and I was like well I said I
[29:36] said I feel bad if you guys got shot and
[29:38] I was the last one I see y'all yeah
[29:41] so so they ended up packing their stuff
[29:44] and they went uh to leave uh follow the
[29:47] group and I went finished packing my
[29:49] stuff and as I walked out the door
[29:51] they were going and I was like okay so
[29:54] they left so
[29:56] so I started walking around and I do
[30:00] want to thank the Lord because I was
[30:02] surprisingly calm through the whole
[30:03] Endeavor like I really wasn't like
[30:05] frantic at all so I was I was like
[30:08] walking around trying to find them at
[30:09] first then I found myself in the
[30:11] basement of the building and there was
[30:14] two older gentlemen they're like staff
[30:16] members and he was like what are you
[30:18] doing you know you need to go and hide
[30:20] and I was like well did you see a group
[30:22] of people I'm trying to find a group I
[30:24] was with and he was like well I put some
[30:26] people in the break room and it was like
[30:28] a solid metal door he had to like use a
[30:32] key to open so he put me in there and
[30:34] he's like these the people and I was
[30:35] like no I didn't know who they were so I
[30:37] said I'm not gonna be picky though right
[30:42] so I went I went in there with them and
[30:45] there was um there was like so there's
[30:47] like a couch right here couch right here
[30:49] and there was a couch um right in front
[30:52] of me and there was a girl sitting on
[30:54] the couch and there was like an empty
[30:56] spot right there and I sat next to her
[30:58] and she was like really frantic like
[31:00] every time I swear I said something she
[31:01] was like shut up don't say anything
[31:02] about it be quiet and it was it was like
[31:05] crazy because they were all like very
[31:06] like uh like their nerves are jumpy and
[31:10] everything and I sat down and I was like
[31:13] well any of y'all gonna Cactus coming
[31:15] with this math problem in the office
[31:17] started laughing because I just wanted
[31:19] to like kind of get their minds off the
[31:20] situation and um they were like it's
[31:22] hard laughing and so we worked on the
[31:24] amount of time for like 20 minutes and
[31:26] then I said this is getting boring I
[31:29] started playing games on the computer I
[31:30] got them to play games with me on the
[31:32] computer and then uh after that it was
[31:34] like quiet for a while and I started
[31:36] thinking about it again you could tell
[31:37] they're like try to like get jumpy every
[31:39] time they heard something so I said man
[31:41] I'm hungry and they started laughing
[31:43] again and so and then throughout
[31:46] throughout the whole Endeavor like it
[31:48] was like
[31:49] the Lord was like I was like praying the
[31:51] whole time but I wasn't praying you know
[31:54] getting me through the situation and
[31:55] protecting me it's just I was so like
[31:57] calm I just knew I was okay and I was
[31:59] like the whole time I was praying thank
[32:01] you Jesus for getting me down here amen
[32:05] amen because I was just thinking like
[32:07] you know
[32:09] that I lost my group you know I could
[32:11] have very well like been in danger and
[32:14] then somehow I'm in a basement behind a
[32:16] securely locked door you know like why
[32:18] did that happen to me and then um like
[32:21] and also the other miracle was the where
[32:24] the man got shot at and died the teacher
[32:28] um he was right across from the street
[32:30] from where I would have been two hours
[32:31] later and then the um the shooter's
[32:35] vehicle where I was actively hiding at
[32:37] was right outside the building so he was
[32:40] around me the whole time but just
[32:41] couldn't find him so I was like that's
[32:43] right you know I was talking to my
[32:45] father and we were saying you know he
[32:47] messed up his GPS he was trying to find
[32:49] me but he couldn't find me so that's why

[40:02] still hear myself when I say amen I hear
[40:04] myself saying amen amen so continue to
[40:07] read your Cod book continue to read your
[40:10] changes continue to read your skills and

[40:17] a wonderful young man meeting yesterday
[40:21] you heard them saying amen
[40:24] a wonderful one they gave me 25
[40:27] questions all together total and I Only
[40:30] Could tackle five of them
[40:32] so at this point they should know how to
[40:34] deal with sisters
[40:41] what they learned yesterday I told them
[40:44] I said I don't want any complaint from
[40:46] your matters
[40:48] because now you know how you can deal
[40:50] with Mama how you can deal with your
[40:52] sister and how you can deal with your
[40:55] wife
[40:56] so whoever was not there you need to
[40:59] catch up quickly and make sure you meet
[41:01] with the young men so they can tell you
[41:03] what's going on I don't want headache in
[41:06] your marriages
[41:07] I want you to treat young sisters the
[41:10] correct way like Christians should amen
[41:12] you know most of the time we say women
[41:15] are complicated
[41:18] there is a reason why they're
[41:19] complicated
[41:22] amen there is a reason why they're
[41:25] complicated they're not complicated just
[41:27] the way they complicated it is not even
[41:30] a complication
[41:32] it is something that we men lack to
[41:35] understand and because we don't
[41:37] understand that we call that
[41:38] complications
[41:40] one of these they will talk to the
[41:42] married people
[41:44] amen
[41:46] can you say Amen
[41:47] is everybody okay
[41:49] sisters are not complicated
[41:52] they are not complicated at all that's
[41:55] what the world say the problem is we
[41:57] don't understand their world
[42:00] that's where we get in trouble
[42:02] and I'm gonna show you that by the
[42:04] scripture that a man should understand
[42:06] the woman world
[42:08] I showed the young men's yesterday they
[42:10] were there I even gave them scripture it
[42:13] seems like the Holy Spirit gave me a
[42:16] different gear when I was talking to the
[42:17] young man and I got scripture that
[42:20] unfortunately I didn't give to the young
[42:22] sisters they came later on so when they
[42:25] heard that the guiding something you
[42:27] don't they were all clapping their hands
[42:30] [Laughter]
[42:32] they were all happy they said we
[42:34] patriarch we the one that are supposed
[42:36] to know those things
[42:38] so I will try my best to refer
[42:43] okay not fair but fur so I will try to
[42:47] give you the scripture before we start a
[42:49] war
[42:51] amen
[42:52] I never even seen it I don't know how I
[42:55] forgot it and the Holy Spirit brought it
[42:57] to me and give me two scripture and now
[42:59] the third and the fourth one so there
[43:01] should be no question at all
[43:04] with something that I don't want to say
[43:05] here
[43:07] and I told them if you ever marry a
[43:10] woman outside this church
[43:12] who is a message believer
[43:14] search for some time so we can sit and
[43:17] we make sure we can brainwash somebody
[43:19] pretty good
[43:21] and make sure what they have is in the
[43:24] word and the message of the hour and if
[43:26] you young sister ever get married to a
[43:29] young man outside this church
[43:31] bring it to me let's sit and let's talk
[43:33] a little bit let me make sure he
[43:35] understands what he's getting into it
[43:38] amen before you become the preacher at
[43:41] home
[43:42] you're the one giving quotes and he
[43:44] doesn't know which coach you're talking
[43:45] about and you keep pulling code one
[43:47] after the other until he's like are you
[43:49] preaching to me you're not preaching I'm
[43:51] just exhorted So to avoid that preaching
[43:54] bring it to me I know what to do I know
[43:56] how to download the USB and I'll put it
[43:59] together amen so give me some time and
[44:01] we'll work together amen
[44:04] glory to God so brother able please if
[44:06] you can work with the young man so we
[44:08] can continue the questions and young
[44:11] sisters I'm still waiting sister Divine
[44:13] on the date for you so we can continue
[44:15] what we're supposed to be dealing with
[44:17] amen Lord's willing on September the
[44:20] 16th this is our question and answer
[44:23] brother Mark Hall
[44:25] contacted me and uh he's having a youth
[44:28] meeting I believe the 14th 15th and 16th
[44:32] something like that but I have the flyer
[44:35] I will give it to the Deacon and they
[44:36] will post it on the on the wall so if
[44:39] somebody have some free time and you
[44:42] have time to go support it be more than
[44:45] happy to go ahead and show some
[44:47] fellowship so he told me that and he
[44:49] sent me the uh the flyer so I would
[44:52] download it and print it out and give it
[44:54] to the Deacon so they can put it on the
[44:56] board I believe I got everything squared
[44:58] away so let's go straight to our
[45:00] scripture now
[45:01] first Samuel chapter 28. can you hear me
[45:04] very good
[45:06] okay I have to be adjusted
[45:12] to hear myself now
[45:15] glory to God praise God
[45:19] amen amen praise God
[45:25] it's first Samuel chapter 28.
[45:29] I told the young man yesterday I say on
[45:32] Sunday when I'm preaching I don't want
[45:34] anybody to have trouble every young man
[45:37] stay up
[45:39] so you get what we're about to deliver
[45:41] every young man stay up
[45:44] if you're struggling a little bit with
[45:46] sleeping you go in the back there
[45:50] I don't want you missing anything
[45:52] amen amen because you are patriarch
[45:56] you're the head of the family
[45:58] the head of the family just like the
[46:02] scripture says
[46:03] it's amazing how people have a problem
[46:05] with God's order
[46:08] I don't know what this world is going to
[46:11] if you're there you can say Amen first
[46:13] Samuel chapter 28 verse 5.
[46:16] the Bible says and when Saul sold the
[46:20] host of the philistine
[46:22] he was afraid
[46:24] and his heart greatly trembled
[46:28] and when Saul in choir of the Lord
[46:33] you might be seated
[46:34] so went
[46:36] and want to hear from God
[46:39] he inquired of the Lord
[46:42] amen
[46:43] how did he inquire from the Lord what
[46:46] was he looking for
[46:47] amen
[46:49] the Bible says verse 6 and when Saul in
[46:53] choir of the Lord
[46:54] the Lord answered him not
[46:58] so the Lord have a way to answer
[47:01] but this time he didn't answer
[47:03] and brother Branham said the reason why
[47:05] because he vaccinated
[47:08] so when you backslide you shut yourself
[47:10] from God
[47:11] it doesn't mean it's God is Not There
[47:14] but it's just God cannot reach to you
[47:17] when it will continue with prayer I will
[47:19] show you why we have to start by
[47:22] confessing our sin first
[47:24] there is a reason why because in the
[47:27] prayer of Jesus Christ forgive us sin
[47:30] was not at the beginning
[47:31] it was somewhere in the middle
[47:33] but when we pray we need to start with
[47:36] there is a reason why
[47:39] and the Bible says and Saul inquire of
[47:42] the Lord and the Lord answer him not
[47:45] neither by what dreams
[47:48] my brother you there yes sir thank you
[47:50] neither by dream nor by what your room
[47:56] you know what I mean John yes sir you
[47:58] remember in time right
[48:00] in which brother brought them say it's
[48:02] the word
[48:04] amen neither by dream
[48:08] not by neither by dream nor by the
[48:11] Europe nor by what Prophets
[48:15] so this is God's system
[48:20] is God's sister
[48:22] of operating
[48:26] amen so if you want to talk to God God
[48:30] can talk to you through a dream
[48:33] God can speak to you through the urine
[48:35] you know the human right you go the
[48:38] prophet goes before the priest the
[48:39] priest had it on the chest
[48:42] amen
[48:43] like a breastplate and then you go you
[48:46] speak and whatever you speak will shine
[48:48] light or not or by the prophet
[48:52] so God can use an inspiration by dream
[48:56] or he can use the real momentum which
[48:59] brother Branham say it's the word or he
[49:01] can speak to you by the prophet and
[49:04] Prophet see visions
[49:07] amen if you recall last Sunday
[49:10] we spoke brother Branham says this and
[49:13] Discord just reminding you brother
[49:15] Branham say but where my faith is based
[49:17] he is concerning a gift that was given
[49:20] me
[49:21] some people receive a revelation some
[49:25] people pick it up out of the water the
[49:27] word the Europe
[49:29] some people take it by what inspiration
[49:32] man is a vision because he's a prophet
[49:35] so God can speak through the dreams he
[49:39] can speak straight by a prophet or God
[49:42] can speak straight through the yo
[49:44] momentum and the prophet in the New
[49:47] Testament brother Branham say it's a
[49:49] preacher
[49:50] in other words when a preacher is
[49:52] preaching the word God can use the
[49:54] preaching of the word and speak to you
[49:56] something straight like that and then
[49:58] you pick it up and that's your
[50:00] Revelation right there that's why we go
[50:02] to church so that we can hear from God
[50:04] Amen and the prophet himself sees also
[50:07] dreams
[50:10] the Bible says in number 12 verse 6 that
[50:14] he says he now my word if there be a
[50:17] water Prophet among you I the Lord will
[50:21] make myself known unto him in what a
[50:24] vision and will speak unto him in a
[50:26] water a dream everybody clear amen a
[50:29] prophet can see a vision or a prophet
[50:32] can even see a dream
[50:34] a dream is when the prophet is sleeping
[50:38] we went through that amen and a vision
[50:40] is when the prophet is awake
[50:44] everybody clear amen we clear so far
[50:48] so verse 7 then say so to his servant
[50:52] God doesn't want to speak
[50:54] seek me a woman
[50:55] that has a what a familiar spirit so
[50:58] when God locks a revelation
[51:04] he opened the door
[51:06] for you to get Revelation from any
[51:09] sources amen
[51:12] in other words you now going into a
[51:15] dangerous ground
[51:16] because God can speak to you
[51:20] in other words lack of Revelation
[51:23] lack of God talking to you
[51:27] amen
[51:28] remove the limits out of your life
[51:33] amen you don't control yourself anymore
[51:38] if God would have spoken in the dream
[51:42] Saul would not have went to the witch
[51:45] if God would have spoken into the your
[51:48] momentum Saul would not have gone to the
[51:51] witch that's right if God would have
[51:53] answered by the prophet Saul would not
[51:56] have wandered all around and and and
[51:58] looking for her for a witch the reason
[52:01] why Saul is going to the witch is
[52:05] because there is no more Revelation amen
[52:13] nobody verse 7 then say song to his
[52:17] servant
[52:18] seek me a woman that has a water
[52:21] familiar Spirit Saul was not looking for
[52:25] this woman to do witchcraft
[52:29] he went through this channel
[52:31] trying to get God from that channel
[52:37] amen is my Bible different amen is my
[52:41] Bible different is my Bible different
[52:45] so when God doesn't speak
[52:48] forget the witch
[52:53] you will find yourself listening to a
[52:55] witch
[52:58] oh she's uh
[53:01] what is a witch
[53:03] I know you thinking about maybe going
[53:06] into the mall and see a fortune tell a
[53:09] woman that's what you're thinking about
[53:10] let me show you the real witch
[53:16] you want to know him huh you want to
[53:18] know the witch
[53:20] let me continue first and then I'll show
[53:22] you the witch amen
[53:25] the Bible says this
[53:27] the Bible says this in the Book of
[53:30] Proverbs verse chapter 27 verse 7. the
[53:34] Bible says that the full soul
[53:37] is that in other words the soul that
[53:39] have eaten and he's full there is no
[53:42] more room for food
[53:44] that's all loaf
[53:47] a honeycomb
[53:51] to explain to you this easily
[53:54] if I give you food
[53:56] and you eat until you fool you cannot
[53:59] eat no more even if I bring you a
[54:03] chocolate cake
[54:04] oh it's strawberry cake you are full you
[54:08] won't even mind the cake
[54:10] you will disgust the cake because you
[54:13] are full so whoever who eat good does it
[54:17] even even a good food you don't need it
[54:19] anymore
[54:21] is it clear now now look at the second
[54:24] part
[54:25] but to the hook hungry Soul every bitter
[54:30] thing is how sweet
[54:33] wow
[54:35] so when you hungry and you don't get
[54:38] food
[54:39] you will eat from a garbage can
[54:48] when you're hungry and you don't eat
[54:50] food
[54:51] you will eat for YouTube
[54:58] you will eat anything that is on YouTube
[55:02] it would taste sweet
[55:04] because you're hungry because you are on
[55:07] the survivor mode
[55:08] like Saul was in survivor mode in
[55:12] survival mode anything help
[55:17] even if it comes from a garbage can you
[55:20] will eat to survive
[55:21] song now forgot who he is he begin to
[55:25] listen to a witch he even want to talk
[55:28] to a Witcher
[55:29] and if you read this the story down the
[55:32] witch even cook for him
[55:35] it is written in your Bible
[55:39] wow
[55:43] amen amen
[55:45] amen verse 7 then say Saul to his
[55:47] servant seek me a woman that has a
[55:50] familiar spirit a medium amen that I may
[55:54] go to her and inquire of her and his
[55:58] servant said to him behold there is a
[56:01] woman that has a familiar spirit and
[56:03] water and door so somebody already knows
[56:05] there is some activity going on there
[56:07] how did they know there was a woman over
[56:10] there they were a Christian how did they
[56:12] know there was a woman over there
[56:14] and they even know the corner

[1:03:38] World Council of churches is a move that
[1:03:42] roam
[1:03:44] have created
[1:03:46] and the blood move every other Church
[1:03:50] except message believers

[1:04:23] only the true brother won't be led by
[1:04:27] the World Council of churches

[1:04:34] so so went in The ecumenical world to
[1:04:39] get his aspiration from there
[1:04:42] in other words the message is not strong
[1:04:44] enough you need to listen to a
[1:04:47] denominational preaching
[1:04:51] you need to get on YouTube and you need
[1:04:54] to be listening to somebody from why you
[1:04:57] join your inspiration and that person
[1:05:00] his organization is in the world Council
[1:05:03] of churches

[1:05:33] what is his position to the message
[1:05:37] if he is not for the message of the hour
[1:05:40] he is not your friend that's right

[1:06:41] aspiration our music from the
[1:06:44] denomination that we condemn the very
[1:06:47] witch that's all killed Saul Now begin
[1:06:50] to go back to the witch again
[1:06:52] to seek for the word of God from there
[1:06:55] so you can find a motivational speaker a
[1:06:59] Steve Harvey
[1:07:00] that's gonna give you some inspiration
[1:07:02] to push you in the morning so you can
[1:07:05] start going to work you don't need Steve

[1:07:24] he tells me who you're listening to
[1:07:26] you listening to this one you're

[1:07:42] and the one you posted is wearing a pant
[1:07:45] a woman wearing a pant
[1:07:46] so you're a message believer you posting
[1:07:49] somebody wearing a pant because they're
[1:07:51] speaking about God
[1:07:54] a witch bringing semia
[1:08:00] oh no it's Samuel but she's a witch
[1:08:03] that's right
[1:08:05] Jesus
[1:08:08] amen do you still love me I'm I'm the
[1:08:12] commission to deliver them amen

[1:08:24] believe everyone amen
[1:08:26] [Music]

[1:08:30] because I don't want any trouble at the
[1:08:32] river
[1:08:33] [Applause]
[1:08:36] everybody okay amen everybody okay
[1:08:39] brother Branham said they were leading
[1:08:41] them well right straight down the road
[1:08:44] down the road where she was watering
[1:08:46] going and she went off to the water the
[1:08:48] left and disappear away in chaos
[1:08:51] reading this music and making really
[1:08:54] funny sound and shaking their body and
[1:08:57] you hear people shake shake shake shake
[1:08:59] keep shaking your body
[1:09:01] everybody okay and shaking their body
[1:09:04] one side and then the other and then
[1:09:06] like that carry on like that doing what
[1:09:08] walking
[1:09:11] any question also let's go to our second
[1:09:14] scripture prophet
[1:09:20] proof
[1:09:21] I am on the second special
[1:09:31] everything
[1:09:34] glory to God
[1:09:37] so lack of instruction lack of vision
[1:09:42] lack of Revelation from God open the
[1:09:46] door to consult a witch
[1:09:49] that's why it's important to hear from
[1:09:51] God
[1:09:53] because if you're hungry and you're
[1:09:56] seeking God and God is not answering
[1:09:58] you're gonna eat from anything
[1:10:01] from a garbage canner
[1:10:03] amen
[1:10:04] and you're gonna have all kind of wisdom
[1:10:07] that they will put on you oh it's wisdom
[1:10:09] they they just giving advice of life
[1:10:12] they themselves look at their life
[1:10:17] hey everybody okay
[1:10:19] young man wake up today
[1:10:22] Proverbs Chapter 30 uh chapter 29 verse
[1:10:27] 18. if you dare you can say amen amen
[1:10:31] Oh Glory to God let's go where there is
[1:10:35] water no vision
[1:10:38] what happened
[1:10:40] when there is no vision
[1:10:43] amen what is the result
[1:10:47] the Bible says when there is no vision
[1:10:51] the people do what you perish
[1:10:56] when we hear that word perish
[1:10:59] we usually think about dying
[1:11:04] when we say there is no vision the
[1:11:07] people died that's not what the
[1:11:09] scripture says
[1:11:12] if you look at another translation and
[1:11:16] you check the root of the word perish
[1:11:19] everybody okay the correct word is
[1:11:22] restraint
[1:11:28] in other words when there is no vision
[1:11:31] the people do not have restraint
[1:11:38] and lack of restraint will make you
[1:11:41] perish
[1:11:45] the one who's reading even in French
[1:11:47] will see that you look at another
[1:11:49] translation the correct translation is
[1:11:52] when there is no vision the people live
[1:11:56] without restraint
[1:12:00] amen amen in other words if you don't
[1:12:03] have a vision you're going to leave any
[1:12:05] kind of ways
[1:12:11] when we say restraint the best way to
[1:12:14] describe restraint is what Paul uses
[1:12:17] Paul says this in uh James chapter 3
[1:12:21] verse 3. Paul says that behold we put
[1:12:25] what bits do you know what a is
[1:12:27] it's called a brother
[1:12:30] we put beats in horses math
[1:12:34] that they may do What obey us so the
[1:12:38] reason why
[1:12:39] we take Brits
[1:12:41] and brother and put it in the horse's
[1:12:44] mouth
[1:12:45] it's to control
[1:12:48] the horse so the Restraint of a brother
[1:12:51] on the horse's mouth amen bring
[1:12:55] obedience
[1:12:59] I don't know if you're getting me in
[1:13:02] other words if you take the brother off
[1:13:04] the horses the horse says
[1:13:08] everybody okay so the reason why they
[1:13:11] put a brother on the horse mask Paulie
[1:13:14] said James is saying that the reason why
[1:13:16] they put that is to uh to bring the the
[1:13:19] the horse in obedience
[1:13:23] so every a brother is a restraint amen
[1:13:26] so when a restraint come in your life it
[1:13:30] brings obedience
[1:13:35] [Music]
[1:13:47] as soon as there is a restraint on a
[1:13:50] horse not only do the horse
[1:13:53] obey me but the horse will begin to move
[1:13:56] according to my desire my direction in
[1:14:01] other words the horses will begin to do
[1:14:04] the will of the horse riding
[1:14:08] everybody okay so the brother on a horse
[1:14:12] remove the self-wheel of the horse amen
[1:14:18] everybody okay and the will of the horse
[1:14:21] is no longer there now the horse is
[1:14:24] reflecting the will of the one ready
[1:14:31] everybody okay if they rather want to go
[1:14:34] to Charlotte the horse will go to
[1:14:36] Charlotte the horse have no more
[1:14:39] Direction
[1:14:42] but the direction of the master
[1:14:44] the horse have no more will
[1:14:47] no more desire but the desire of the one
[1:14:50] running and to bring a horse to that
[1:14:54] level you must put a brother
[1:14:56] you must put a restraint you must put
[1:15:00] something that will limit that will
[1:15:03] control the movement of a horse amen
[1:15:07] and now Solomon say if there is no
[1:15:11] vision amen the people have no restraint
[1:15:17] in other words a vision from God will
[1:15:21] bring restraint
[1:15:26] when you catch God vision for your life
[1:15:29] that Vision will put you into a
[1:15:32] different moment that Vision will rock
[1:15:35] your life
[1:15:40] everybody good
[1:15:41] good everybody good
[1:15:44] Solomon say a lack of vision amen where
[1:15:49] there is no vision
[1:15:50] the people perish in other words the
[1:15:53] people live without self-control
[1:15:56] they are uncontrolled amen he says the
[1:16:01] people perish but he that keep if they
[1:16:04] want the love happy is he
[1:16:07] with that vision
[1:16:10] so
[1:16:12] didn't have any more restraint
[1:16:16] he can eat anything
[1:16:18] and before you know it he goes to the
[1:16:20] witch
[1:16:21] because the vision put a brother on soul
[1:16:24] when they took the vision of God doesn't
[1:16:26] speak by Vision God doesn't speak by
[1:16:29] dream God do not speak by anything
[1:16:32] now there is no more brother there is no
[1:16:35] more restraint so forgot who he is he
[1:16:39] forgot what he did he forgot what he
[1:16:42] destroyed he now go back to what he
[1:16:44] destroyed and begin to end it what
[1:16:46] caused him because lack of a vision
[1:16:49] any question
[1:16:51] let's go to look one
[1:16:58] lack of vision lack of a revelation it's
[1:17:01] a problem
[1:17:03] if you dare you can say a man
[1:17:05] Luke chapter 1 verse 34 I'm going down
[1:17:08] because we already dealt with the first
[1:17:10] one then say Mary to the angel how shall
[1:17:13] it be seeing a no no not a man
[1:17:17] and the angel answer and say to her the
[1:17:20] Holy Ghost shall come upon you and the
[1:17:23] power of the highest shall overshadow
[1:17:25] you therefore also the holy thing which
[1:17:29] shall be born of you shall be called The
[1:17:31] Son of God and behold we went through
[1:17:34] this your cousin Elizabeth amen
[1:17:38] she also she has also conceived
[1:17:42] a son in her old age and this is the
[1:17:46] sixth month with her who was called
[1:17:48] Baron
[1:17:49] for with God
[1:17:51] nothing
[1:17:52] shall be impossible we clear amen verse
[1:17:56] 38 and Mary say behold the handmaid of
[1:18:00] the Lord
[1:18:01] be it unto me according to your word and
[1:18:05] the angel did what departed from her
[1:18:08] the scripture never describe anything
[1:18:11] happening to me
[1:18:13] beside the conversation
[1:18:16] the package was delivered
[1:18:19] to the right address
[1:18:21] and Mary look at the package he say is
[1:18:23] this my package they say yes this belong
[1:18:26] to you you are highly favored you say
[1:18:28] okay if this is what God wants for my
[1:18:31] life
[1:18:32] how is this going to happen God help her
[1:18:34] a little bit brother Branham said
[1:18:36] because nothing like that happened
[1:18:37] before and God gave a little bit more
[1:18:40] explanation so that Mary can receive the
[1:18:43] package when the explanation was given
[1:18:45] like it's not you it is the Holy Ghost
[1:18:47] who will do it Mary say you know what
[1:18:50] let it be down unto me according to
[1:18:52] water
[1:18:54] that's all that happened
[1:18:57] that's what we know but look what
[1:19:00] happened in Mary that we didn't know
[1:19:03] because of what she said
[1:19:05] when she said no sensation no feeling
[1:19:09] she didn't scream she didn't roll on the
[1:19:12] ground she just said
[1:19:14] be unto me according to his word what is
[1:19:18] that declaration doing in Mary's life
[1:19:22] let's see what he does verse 39 and Mary
[1:19:26] arose in water those days so it was not
[1:19:29] like seven months in the very within the
[1:19:32] very same period Mary moved amen she
[1:19:36] arose in those days and went into the
[1:19:39] Hill Country with haste into a city of
[1:19:42] water Judah because they told her about
[1:19:45] Elizabeth so she packed everything
[1:19:47] quickly and just move on straight I'm
[1:19:50] gonna see what happened over there and
[1:19:52] enter into the house of Zechariah indeed
[1:19:55] what saluted Elizabeth
[1:19:57] and he came to pass that when Elizabeth
[1:20:01] heard the water situation of Mary the
[1:20:05] salutation
[1:20:10] what kind of salutation is it if I tell
[1:20:13] you hi and the baby begin to jump
[1:20:17] you need the Thunder for this
[1:20:21] amen it was not like hello
[1:20:26] that's not the sanitation
[1:20:29] there was a salutation different
[1:20:32] only a thunder can reveal this and
[1:20:35] brother Branham went inside and brother
[1:20:37] Branham got into the conversation and he
[1:20:40] looked at the conversation he said it
[1:20:42] was not alone
[1:20:43] he said the two girls were talking a
[1:20:46] little bit
[1:20:48] I will show you a scripture like that
[1:20:50] amen
[1:20:52] because sometimes the Bible will say
[1:20:54] something and hide something and you
[1:20:57] have to go to another book to see what
[1:20:59] really happened between the storm I will
[1:21:02] prove to you everybody okay according to
[1:21:05] what they say here it's just a
[1:21:06] salutation hello hello and the baby
[1:21:09] begin to jump no the baby didn't jump
[1:21:12] like that
[1:21:13] amen there was something that was spoken
[1:21:15] in that salutation that made the baby
[1:21:18] jump
[1:21:19] and brother Branham say it was the name
[1:21:22] of Jesus Christ
[1:21:24] that was mentioned by Mary and the First
[1:21:28] Time The Name of Jesus Christ was
[1:21:31] mentioned not by Angel
[1:21:34] but by a human being he brought a dead
[1:21:37] baby to life
[1:21:39] [Applause]
[1:21:41] [Music]
[1:21:44] how can the word of Mary
[1:21:48] begin to bring Resurrection
[1:21:51] where did she get the power
[1:21:54] of Resurrection
[1:21:56] because the judge was dead
[1:21:59] amen so the simple fact of saying be
[1:22:03] unto me according to your word have
[1:22:07] already transferred power
[1:22:11] and Mary didn't know until she spoke and
[1:22:16] she began to see things begin to happen
[1:22:19] so when you're saying a man to this
[1:22:21] message amen you might not feel nothing
[1:22:24] [Applause]
[1:22:27] you might not see a lot of things
[1:22:29] happening but when you gonna speak
[1:22:33] you will see what was holding you amen
[1:22:38] brother Branham say the restoration of
[1:22:41] the word bring the restoration of the
[1:22:44] power so when you receive the word you
[1:22:48] are actually transferring power amen
[1:22:54] [Applause]
[1:22:58] amen means so be
[1:23:01] in other words be unto me
[1:23:03] [Applause]
[1:23:10] that's why when I tell you say amen I
[1:23:13] know why I'm saying you man
[1:23:14] because I want you to say beer to me so
[1:23:18] that the power can be changed
[1:23:21] [Music]
[1:23:25] [Applause]
[1:23:26] don't say Amen to me as a man but you
[1:23:30] say Amen to the world Amen
[1:23:33] amen
[1:23:34] [Applause]
[1:23:39] oh my God where am I at brother Kelly

[1:50:36] your problem
[1:50:38] [Music]
[1:50:39] [Applause]
[1:50:42] everybody do this everybody good
[1:50:47] listen to brother Branham brother
[1:50:49] Branham saying in paragraph 43 so why
[1:50:52] does God let trouble come
[1:50:55] this is our question
[1:50:59] you want to know the answer let's
[1:51:01] brother Brown a mentor himself brother
[1:51:03] Branham saying God do what harness is
[1:51:06] trouble and put water
[1:51:12] [Music]
[1:51:13] in other words God put their brother on
[1:51:18] your trial
[1:51:20] [Music]
[1:51:23] he said he puts water bits in its mouth
[1:51:26] to make it obey him
[1:51:33] [Applause]
[1:51:36] remember the word when Satan is coming
[1:51:39] towards you before he touches you God
[1:51:42] said hold on
[1:51:43] [Music]
[1:51:44] he said who are you going to brother
[1:51:47] Charles wait a minute I need to put some
[1:51:49] brother on you
[1:51:52] to put that restraint on you
[1:51:55] only do what a purpose for you to do on
[1:51:58] him
[1:52:01] [Music]
[1:52:03] when Satan wanted to tempt job God gives
[1:52:07] jobs and limitation he said you can
[1:52:10] touch him here but don't take his life
[1:52:12] because job had the purpose of God
[1:52:16] and the purpose was not fulfilliant
[1:52:18] there is no way Lucifer can take job out
[1:52:21] a matter of fact God multiply everything
[1:52:24] everything double
[1:52:26] [Applause]
[1:52:32] your trial has been brought up by God
[1:52:36] that's why the scripture say he can
[1:52:39] never give you a trial that is greater
[1:52:41] than your water
[1:52:43] greater than your strength because God
[1:52:45] brought up the child he gives limitation
[1:52:48] he said only what I want you to do do
[1:52:52] this
[1:52:53] this one you do it to your own children
[1:52:55] not my children
[1:52:57] [Music]
[1:52:57] [Applause]
[1:53:01] [Music]
[1:53:03] when somebody else discipline your
[1:53:06] children they discipline them
[1:53:08] differently than yourself but when you
[1:53:11] discipline there is something in you
[1:53:12] that is hurting you because it's your
[1:53:14] own child so you are disciplining
[1:53:17] carefully that's how God discipline you
[1:53:20] sometimes he discipline and he himself
[1:53:22] goes and say why have I done this
[1:53:25] [Music]
[1:53:26] the Bible said God repented when he
[1:53:30] looked at Israel God repented
[1:53:36] [Applause]
[1:53:37] brother Branham say God harness trouble
[1:53:41] put in the mouth and makes it
[1:53:44] water obey him just like a horse and
[1:53:47] those trouble bring us into a water a
[1:53:49] closer fellowship with God
[1:53:54] who wins
[1:53:55] who wins what did the devil do he just
[1:53:59] brought you closer to God
[1:54:01] and you are still alive
[1:54:02] [Applause]
[1:54:09] so you can turn around and say Satan
[1:54:12] before you came I didn't know the
[1:54:14] resurrection but since you came now I
[1:54:17] know that my redeemer lives
[1:54:25] [Applause]

[1:54:33] [Applause]
[1:54:37] you will see her second turn around and
[1:54:40] say get out of here

[1:54:52] brother Branham saying Lord help me to
[1:54:54] move brother brought him say
[1:54:57] I said he was a prophet
[1:55:00] he had to be saved
[1:55:02] God saved him
[1:55:04] and God is what not an Indian giver
[1:55:12] do you know what an Indian giver is
[1:55:15] do you know what an Indian giver is
[1:55:17] how many knows what an Indian giver is
[1:55:21] brother brother say an Indian giver is
[1:55:24] somebody who comes and gives you
[1:55:26] something
[1:55:27] and then tomorrow that same person can
[1:55:29] come back and say no give me my stuff

[1:55:34] brother Branham say God is that like
[1:55:36] that
[1:55:36] in other words when God already decided
[1:55:39] to give you something even God cannot
[1:55:43] take it back
[1:55:46] [Applause]
[1:55:51] everybody okay everybody good listen to

[1:55:57] Indian giver brother said as we call it
[1:56:00] amen well if God gives you the Holy
[1:56:04] Ghost
[1:56:04] knowing that he's going to lose you
[1:56:07] rather than today I had to write down
[1:56:09] here why what the foolish thing it will
[1:56:13] be for him to give you the holy ghost in
[1:56:15] the first place
[1:56:16] why did you give me the Holy Ghost and
[1:56:18] you know I'm gonna die
[1:56:19] and I will be lost
[1:56:21] God don't invest like that
[1:56:24] he's a very good investor
[1:56:27] [Music]
[1:56:28] God don't invest for loss
[1:56:31] [Applause]
[1:56:33] he always invests to make again
[1:56:37] you know the parable of the talent
[1:56:39] everyone that was giving the tenant had
[1:56:42] the power to multiply hundred percent
[1:56:44] [Applause]
[1:56:48] you might impersonate the Holy Ghost and
[1:56:52] act like you got the Holy Ghost but if
[1:56:55] you get the Holy Ghost God knows your
[1:56:58] beginning
[1:57:00] the end
[1:57:03] everybody okay that's right that is a
[1:57:07] lose weight to run business
[1:57:09] God don't run he's like that
[1:57:12] here's how infinite he knows the water
[1:57:15] and from the beginning and know if
[1:57:18] everything that ever be here
[1:57:20] fly every night would be a be would ever
[1:57:24] be on earth he knowed all about it
[1:57:27] before the word ever water began see
[1:57:31] would he run his business
[1:57:34] for he

[1:57:39] you at your creation at your making at
[1:57:43] your fabrication whatever God already
[1:57:46] put in you God will never remove that
[1:57:50] and that purpose will be fulfilled
[1:57:53] exactly how God wanted to be prepared
[1:57:56] the responsible

[2:01:01] let's go to Fest Timothy let's take Paul
[2:01:04] Lord help me
[2:01:07] let's go to First Timothy chapter one
[2:01:09] where am I at glory to God oh my God
[2:01:12] we're good in time
[2:01:15] glory to God
[2:01:17] Hallelujah God has a purpose for you
[2:01:24] gailed God has a plan a future a thought
[2:01:30] a project
[2:01:31] that he that he made you and the way God
[2:01:35] make you is according to your project

[2:01:40] that's why I say last Sunday you're a
[2:01:42] woman be happy
[2:01:44] there is a props but there is a project
[2:01:46] for you
[2:01:48] and God has to make you a certain way
[2:01:51] a certain height
[2:01:54] a certain complexion your hair have to
[2:01:57] be a certain way because there is a
[2:01:59] certain man that will always match that
[2:02:01] one
[2:02:02] [Applause]
[2:02:06] he won't see none of them he's blind
[2:02:09] because he's also programmed for a
[2:02:11] certain woman a certain height a certain
[2:02:15] type that when the woman comes he's
[2:02:17] already designed
[2:02:21] [Laughter]
[2:02:26] Oh Glory to God
[2:02:29] let me leave that channel let's go
[2:02:32] let me go to another Channel let's go to
[2:02:35] First Timothy Oh Glory to God this this
[2:02:39] thing you need to know them so it gives
[2:02:41] you peace
[2:02:43] in the midst of trial
[2:02:45] when things don't go wrong don't go
[2:02:48] right you say don't worry Satan I know
[2:02:52] who I am
[2:02:52] [Applause]
[2:02:57] he didn't create me for this
[2:02:59] you lying
[2:03:01] this is lying that's what Jonah said
[2:03:04] this is
[2:03:08] because Jonah know what God told him
[2:03:14] let's look at Paul my God glory to God
[2:03:17] let's look at the power of vision in
[2:03:20] thoughts
[2:03:21] First Timothy chapter one if you're
[2:03:23] there you can say amen amen verse 12
[2:03:25] Paul say and I thank Christ Jesus our
[2:03:29] lord who has done what enabled me
[2:03:32] for that he counted me how faithful how
[2:03:36] can you count perfect for putting the
[2:03:38] the water Christian in prison
[2:03:42] huh how could Paul be faithful he's
[2:03:45] blaspheming
[2:03:47] he's torturing the Christians when God
[2:03:49] look at him he said Paul is faithful
[2:03:53] so which Paul was God looking at
[2:04:01] can I continue can I continue Paul says
[2:04:05] that he counted me faithful putting me
[2:04:08] into the water the ministry God didn't
[2:04:10] see a risk
[2:04:12] for putting Paul in the ministry because
[2:04:15] God run his business a certain way
[2:04:18] so when he looked at Paul he said this
[2:04:20] is a good asset to put in the business
[2:04:23] he's going to be faithful
[2:04:26] everybody okay
[2:04:28] verse 13 who was before a water a
[2:04:31] blasphemer Kama and a water a persecutor
[2:04:35] injurious comma but I obtained what
[2:04:39] Mercy because I did it how ignorantly
[2:04:42] unbelief
[2:04:47] so we got two Paul here
[2:04:51] we got the first ball that was bad
[2:04:53] in ignorance
[2:04:55] not knowing the project of God for his
[2:04:58] life
[2:04:58] and we got a second Paul that understood
[2:05:01] that huh he counted me faithful
[2:05:04] what what he does to Paul you there
[2:05:07] verse 14 and the grace of our Lord was
[2:05:11] how exceeding abundance with water faith
[2:05:14] and water and love which is in water in
[2:05:17] Christ Jesus
[2:05:18] above the faith
[2:05:20] who gave him the love
[2:05:22] a Paul of faith and love who gave it to
[2:05:25] Paul
[2:05:26] why they didn't give it to Judah
[2:05:30] Judah only betrayed and was stealing
[2:05:32] money but Paul was killing
[2:05:35] and putting people in prison and
[2:05:37] blaspheming
[2:05:39] if you look you say wait a minute but
[2:05:41] Stephen Judah preached the gospel Paul
[2:05:43] is making a big mistake God was not
[2:05:46] looking at that
[2:05:48] everybody okay everybody okay verse 15
[2:05:51] and he says this is a faithful sin and
[2:05:55] worthy of water acceptation of Water
[2:05:58] all acceptation in other words Everybody
[2:06:02] Must agree with this
[2:06:04] I agree with what that Christ Jesus came
[2:06:07] into the world
[2:06:08] Amen to save who Sinners of whom I am
[2:06:12] what Chief how can Paul be a sinner
[2:06:16] do you think Paul was going to the
[2:06:18] nightclub
[2:06:19] I will show you he was a Pharisee of the
[2:06:21] Pharisee
[2:06:24] but he found out that he was a religious
[2:06:26] sinner
[2:06:28] which is the top really the top sinners
[2:06:33] The Sinner the jack her off and then
[2:06:35] knows what he's doing the religious is
[2:06:37] the top one
[2:06:39] let me continue amen however for this
[2:06:43] course
[2:06:45] I obtain Mercy that in me
[2:06:49] first amen
[2:06:51] Jesus Christ must show forth on water
[2:06:54] long-suffering
[2:06:56] for a water a pattern
[2:07:00] to them which should hear after belief
[2:07:03] on him to Life water Everlasting so Paul
[2:07:06] was an example that Jesus used
[2:07:10] to demonstrate his grace
[2:07:13] that because Jesus knew that there are
[2:07:15] some people that will come on the future
[2:07:17] they will do stuff like Paul
[2:07:20] they will need some hope so let me use
[2:07:23] Paul and put him as an example so in the
[2:07:26] future when those people come when they
[2:07:29] look at Paul they say if Paul can make
[2:07:31] it I will make it
[2:07:32] [Music]
[2:07:35] everybody clear so far everybody clear
[2:07:37] so far
[2:07:38] we clear so far let's go to uh Acts
[2:07:42] chapter 9.
[2:07:43] we understand Paul here a religious
[2:07:46] injurious did bad stuff and everything
[2:07:48] we're trying to see the power of a
[2:07:51] vision or the power of a revelation
[2:07:54] let's go to the book of Acts this man
[2:07:56] that was the Pharisee of the Pharisee
[2:07:59] they ate today from the stock of
[2:08:02] Benjamin
[2:08:04] according to the Lord Paul said he was
[2:08:06] blameless
[2:08:07] but when he come to cross he said I was
[2:08:10] the chief sinner
[2:08:12] what changed Paul

[2:11:00] he need to wait for instruction yet
[2:11:04] watch and has sin in a what a vision
[2:11:08] Paul before they even pray for him he
[2:11:10] begin to see vision
[2:11:13] that's right everybody okay have sin in
[2:11:17] a vision a man named ananias coming in
[2:11:21] and putting his hand on him that he may
[2:11:24] receive what his side then ananiah says
[2:11:27] with the Lord I have heard by many of
[2:11:30] these men how much what evil not good he
[2:11:33] had done to your Center Jerusalem and
[2:11:36] here he has Authority from the hype from
[2:11:38] the chief priest to bind all that call
[2:11:41] on your name
[2:11:42] that's the testimony they have about
[2:11:44] Paul look at God's changing the vision
[2:11:48] everybody okay amen amen Paul was born
[2:11:51] for a different purpose than what he was
[2:11:53] doing amen verse 15 but the Lord said to
[2:11:57] him go
[2:11:59] your way for he is the water a chosen
[2:12:02] vessel
[2:12:05] when did they chose Paul
[2:12:07] when he was born
[2:12:09] when he was serving the devil no sir the
[2:12:13] purpose of God for power will not change
[2:12:15] no matter how much mistake
[2:12:19] how much destruction how much trouble
[2:12:23] Paul was not killing sinners
[2:12:27] [Music]
[2:12:30] Paul was killing Christians
[2:12:33] the purpose of God in the life of Paul
[2:12:37] cannot change
[2:12:39] God cannot stop and say man you kill so
[2:12:42] much of my children I need to change my
[2:12:45] mind never
[2:12:47] God is doomed
[2:12:49] to use nothing nobody else but Paul
[2:12:53] be faithful
[2:12:55] killing why because Paul is a chosen
[2:13:00] vessel
[2:13:03] everybody okay
[2:13:06] the Bible said Paul Yahweh he is a
[2:13:10] chosen vessel to me
[2:13:12] to Bear my name before Gentile and Kings
[2:13:17] and the children of Israel for I will
[2:13:20] show him her great thing he must suffer
[2:13:23] for my name water saying this is not God
[2:13:25] talking to Paul
[2:13:27] this is God talking to ananias God
[2:13:31] fixing the vision of ananias
[2:13:34] fixing fixing the perception of ananias
[2:13:38] toward Paul because ananias still see
[2:13:42] Paul as an evil man
[2:13:43] and God says Paul is not evil
[2:13:47] Paul in my calendar
[2:13:49] in my in in the Book of Life he's not a
[2:13:53] sinner he is a chosen vessel another

[2:13:58] vocabulary
[2:14:02] [Applause]
[2:14:06] for men

[2:14:33] again that way
[2:14:35] don't look at him that way change your
[2:14:38] vision
[2:14:39] [Applause]
[2:14:40] thank you

[2:19:18] Jesus and Paul that was now written
[2:19:20] there it is written somewhere else watch
[2:19:22] what happened between Jesus and Paul all

[2:23:13] over there that's why when you read the
[2:23:15] Bible whatever they say there is not the
[2:23:17] absolute right because the time they
[2:23:19] hide stuff
[2:23:21] that's why I say when Mary came and
[2:23:23] spoke it was not just hello there was
[2:23:26] something that was there everybody okay
[2:23:28] I have appeared to you for this purpose
[2:23:31] to make you a minister and a witness
[2:23:34] both of these things which you have seen
[2:23:36] and of those things in which
[2:23:40] I will appear to you delivering you from
[2:23:43] the people look the conversation between
[2:23:46] Jesus and Paul
[2:23:47] and and God was speaking in Hebrew
[2:23:49] language
[2:23:50] Paul have to hear that amen and from the
[2:23:54] Gentile to whom now I send you to open
[2:23:58] their eyes
[2:24:00] you see the package of Paul you see the
[2:24:03] package of Paul so it was not just a
[2:24:05] light that hit him no the light gave him
[2:24:08] the vision the plan the purpose of God
[2:24:11] for Paul's life
[2:24:14] everybody okay he says to turn them from
[2:24:18] Darkness to light and from the power of
[2:24:20] Satan to who God that they may receive
[2:24:23] water forgiveness of sin and inheritance
[2:24:27] among them which are water Sanctified by
[2:24:30] faith that is water in me that is the
[2:24:33] purpose the Revelation the vision of
[2:24:37] power of God and people now that the
[2:24:41] purpose of Paul has been revealed to
[2:24:44] Paul not to ananias now to Paul because
[2:24:47] this instruction didn't receive it
[2:24:50] ananias received his perspective to
[2:24:53] correct him about the way he looks at
[2:24:56] Paul but Paul receive a specific
[2:24:58] instruction about what God sent him to
[2:25:01] do now that Paul received that vision
[2:25:05] now that Paul received the Revelation
[2:25:08] what does that Vision doing Paul

[2:25:36] division of power for his life give him
[2:25:39] determination he give for the boldness
[2:25:43] he transformed the life of Paul
[2:25:46] until nothing can change power
[2:25:50] and Paul is before the king fulfilling
[2:25:53] that Vision because God said he's going
[2:25:56] to stand before Kings
[2:25:58] so when he looked at King Agrippa Paul
[2:26:00] is not afraid he's not even ashamed he's

[2:31:49] is that one thing that Paul keep one
[2:31:52] thing that I do I do what
[2:31:56] forgetting those things which are what
[2:31:58] behind
[2:32:00] [Music]
[2:32:03] now that I know who I am
[2:32:07] now that I know the purpose of God for
[2:32:10] my life I have only one thing whatever
[2:32:14] you know of me before
[2:32:17] [Music]
[2:32:19] whatever record you have of me me I have
[2:32:23] only one thing to do
[2:32:24] [Applause]
[2:32:26] behind me
[2:32:27] I forget about it

[2:32:41] back there
[2:32:44] everybody okay don't come and tell me
[2:32:47] how much I feel

[2:33:01] the power of a vision
[2:33:03] can I continue give me few minutes my
[2:33:06] friend he says I forget about what those
[2:33:10] things which are water

[2:33:13] for those feet my friend is there we on
[2:33:16] verse 13.
[2:33:18] verse 13. but this one thing I do did
[2:33:21] you see that
[2:33:22] forgetting those things which I have
[2:33:24] behind and reaching forth to those
[2:33:27] things which are what before in other
[2:33:29] words before me is a vision and I cannot
[2:33:32] be disobedient to the vision now when
[2:33:35] I'm moving
[2:33:36] um I keep my head straight
[2:33:39] I don't look in the real mirror anymore
[2:33:43] yourself
[2:33:47] let me help you up this road is a
[2:33:50] one-way Road amen
[2:33:52] it is not a two-way rule so when
[2:33:55] division of Paul came to his life Paul
[2:33:58] stop his car
[2:34:00] he took the rear viewer and he removed
[2:34:03] it with a screwdriver
[2:34:07] everybody okay and he put it on the
[2:34:09] downstairs so that whenever Paul is
[2:34:12] driving he will never see what happened
[2:34:15] in the past
[2:34:18] because the past will discourage you the
[2:34:22] best won't weaken you the past will
[2:34:25] condemn you
[2:34:27] a class there is no condemnation amen
[2:34:31] there is only one thing I know what is
[2:34:34] before me
[2:34:36] and what is before me is the plan that
[2:34:38] God revealed for me for my life
[2:34:43] [Applause]
[2:34:50] give me a few minutes
[2:34:52] Paul says I press verse 14 I press
[2:34:55] toward the water the mark for the water
[2:34:57] price of water the high calling you see
[2:35:00] he found the high coming he found
[2:35:02] something bigger High Calling of who God
[2:35:05] and who Christ Jesus everybody okay
[2:35:07] watch what Paul says this is what the
[2:35:10] brother read on on on Wednesday didn't
[2:35:12] know I had it for Sunday Paul said I am
[2:35:15] now how
[2:35:19] crucified with Christ nevertheless I
[2:35:22] live but what
[2:35:26] Christ
[2:35:27] leave it in me
[2:35:29] now in the flesh
[2:35:33] the faith
[2:35:38] Son of God
[2:35:43] of the world
[2:35:46] and he did watch her for me when Jesus
[2:35:50] Christ gave himself for Paul was Paul
[2:35:52] converted
[2:35:55] so what Jesus was dying at the cross he
[2:35:58] was also dying for Paul
[2:36:03] I think he gave himself for me so the
[2:36:06] cross belonged to power and Paul said
[2:36:08] listen Jesus was not even crucified
[2:36:11] alone
[2:36:13] wait with me there I am water so when
[2:36:17] Christ died we die together
[2:36:19] [Applause]
[2:36:22] is already dead the life that I Live Now
[2:36:29] and live that life by a new vision by
[2:36:34] the new revelation by a new instruction
[2:36:37] and forgetting everything that is behind
[2:36:40] because it is haunting me the devil is
[2:36:44] specialist in the past so one thing that
[2:36:47] I do I keep kicking the devil in the
[2:36:49] past kick it in the fell in the back
[2:36:51] when the devil come and say Paul you you
[2:36:54] threatened the church he said do you
[2:36:57] remember the cross you didn't see me die
[2:37:00] here because
[2:37:01] you didn't see me paying the price what
[2:37:04] price should I pay again
[2:37:11] let's land this ship my friend
[2:37:13] because what is behind is a little bit
[2:37:15] more deeper Paul says this let's land
[2:37:18] this ship he says therefore If any man
[2:37:21] beware in Christ he is a new water
[2:37:24] creature
[2:37:26] passed away
[2:37:29] passed away means they are dead
[2:37:33] they are inherited
[2:37:36] they are passed away before
[2:37:38] no
[2:37:42] because I'm working in the newness of
[2:37:44] life

[2:37:50] put off concerning the former
[2:37:51] conversation or life the water oh man
