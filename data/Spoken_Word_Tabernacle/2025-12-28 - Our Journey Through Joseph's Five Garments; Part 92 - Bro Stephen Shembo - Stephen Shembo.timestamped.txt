[1:00:16] a.m. in the morning in India. They are waking up to be on prayer service before they go to
[1:00:22] work and take their children as at 4:00 a.m. in India. Some are overseas in Africa, in Nigeria,
[1:00:28] they are waking up. So if those people are waking up at 4:00 a.m. and here you came back from work
[1:00:34] and you say, "No, let me take a break." No, you need prayer. Amen. Amen. Amen. So prayer
[1:00:40] service at 700 p.m. The link is still the same. Usually I send the link so somebody doesn't say

[1:02:51] it again as soon as I got an okay it finished. So just know it's those dates. So disregard the first
[1:02:57] date that we gave you. Amen. I received a poll for the young sisters meeting. So I ask a question.

[1:03:10] and then go over things. I don't want to let you too far off and then you begin to forget certain
[1:03:17] things. Let's regroup again and make sure we all on the same page. Amen. The building project. You
[1:03:23] can see what's going on. I don't have to talk too much because the building is more louder than me.

[1:03:38] is not the building moving? You know what to do. Just do what you got to do and the building will
[1:03:43] keep moving. We got big bills that we wiping by God's grace. But my wife gave a testimony on

[1:03:57] "Let's open the testimony together." that we open up $5,000 church.
[1:04:06] Not from this church, from way up somewhere. But I have to protect the person. I know you going to be

[1:04:42] the bill quickly by God's grace. But remember, we are talking about faith. Huh? If you got $20,

[1:05:53] no problem. You can stay home. If you're sick, you can stream. Amen. But be careful.
[1:06:04] I wanted to avoid this. This is not a rebuke. Uh let me let me clarify this because I know
[1:06:12] this is not a rebuke. Whoever stay at home, that was legitimate. Even brother Micah who's
[1:06:18] at home. Brother Michael, this is legitimate. Ah, so let's remove the devil. Whoever sister
[1:06:24] bridging it to everybody. That was legitimate. Okay. Because you got a conscience. You don't

[1:06:59] immune. If somebody come to you, just give me a call. We clear so far? We clear so far. But
[1:07:06] I just felt from the Holy Ghost that I need to say this that sometime you need to be careful.
[1:07:15] When you sick, where do you go? To the hospital. Do you
[1:07:21] worry about the nurse getting your sickness?
[1:07:26] No problem with those that stays. Do you worry about the security guy getting sick?
[1:07:32] Do you worry about the doctor getting sick? No. You are you are you you have enough faith
[1:07:42] to believe that when I'm getting to the hospital, I will be free, but nobody will get sick.
[1:07:51] Are we together? Are we together? It is okay to go to the hospital when you don't feel all right.
[1:08:01] Some of you are afraid. William Marion Brham.
[1:08:08] Amen. All right. The Bible, brother Brham says in the principles of divine healing.
[1:08:15] He said the first thing a person does when they get what to say maybe around
[1:08:21] home you have a few remedies and thing you try. Some have ginger.
[1:08:32] Are we together? Some have Advil code and sness. Some have all type of a a

[1:08:52] say amen. Brother say the first thing when you get sick, what do you do? Go to your home pharmacy.
[1:08:59] So everybody should have a pharmacy at home. Hallelujah. Where you keep your vicks and uh
[1:09:09] have I say something wrong? Uh you're not helping me. You need to go open up
[1:09:15] your cabinet and get a Tylenol and get a Advil because God heals by medicine. Now,
[1:09:24] can you say amen? Amen. Can you say amen? Amen. All right. Thank you very much,
[1:09:32] brother. Brandham say the next thing. When we say the next thing, it means your ginger didn't work.
[1:09:43] It means your magic solution didn't work. Have I say something wrong? If not, we continue. We
[1:09:50] close. We go straight to the brother. Brother said in other words if your staff doesn't work if your
[1:09:56] taleno your robbitum your day quill your n your terra flu your tummy flu all your flu medication
[1:10:13] if it doesn't work what should we do William Brham brother Brham said the next thing is maybe you do
[1:10:22] call your doctor. So there is nothing wrong about going to the hospital. Can you say amen? Uh he
[1:10:30] say you call your doctor. That is a what sensible thing to do. So it's normal, it's reasonable for
[1:10:38] you to call the doctor. Are we together? Are we together? Are we together? So I'm giving you faith
[1:10:46] for your medication. All right, brother. Faith for the doctor. But I'm going to move to a faith to a
[1:10:55] different realm. Brother Brandham say, "And if the doctor can do you no good." Amen. Then you got a
[1:11:05] right to go to who? God. That is what you should do. Call on who? God. And God is the author of
[1:11:12] what? Circumstance. He can do what? Nothing else can do. When man comes to the end of the land,
[1:11:19] God can too. Are we together? Amen. Are we together? Amen. Are we together? Amen. If you
[1:11:27] sick, get your medication at home. If you sick, go to the emergency room. If you seek, go to God.
[1:11:36] Amen. Are we together? Amen. Brother Brham says in the message, it is I be not afraid. And now
[1:11:42] you cry. The sensible thing, the what? Reasonable thing. When you get sick is go to who? The doctor.
[1:11:51] That is right. When your doctor fails, then you say, "I got to go somewhere else." So there is
[1:11:58] nothing wrong going to the hospital. Yes, sir. Are we together? Amen. But the rapture is approaching.
[1:12:11] The rapture is approaching and as the rapture is approaching our faith need to be higher. Amen.
[1:12:22] That's it. That's it. That's it. Come on, brother. Come on,
[1:12:28] brother. When you go get uh your terra flu, do you spend money?
[1:12:32] Yes. When you go to the emergency room, you know why you crying in the emergency room. You're not
[1:12:38] crying for the medication. You crying for for what is going to follow two weeks after your
[1:12:46] visit. You crying for $2,000 that is coming in the mail. But there is one that can heal you
[1:12:58] without a penny because by his trap you were here. Are we together? I am not
[1:13:09] rebuking anyone. I am I told you I have to preach 10. I won't stay with you in six. I
[1:13:18] have to push you all the way to 10 all the way to what this message is supposed to produce.
[1:13:28] Are we together? How many people want to go to the rapture? Now listen to brother Brham.
[1:13:35] Brother Brham is saying this. Brother Brham say I truly believe when before not after before the
[1:13:44] church can have what? The rapture. Got to have water rapturing faith. We can't even have faith
[1:13:51] for divine healing let alone water rapturing faith. So divine healing is elementary faith.
[1:14:05] Don't worry. Don't worry. Even if you don't want to climb, I will put uh something and then go and
[1:14:12] pump you up until you continue to go up. Are we together? Are we together? Brother Brandham say
[1:14:19] before you even get to rapturing faith, divine healing must be normal. That's correct. That's
[1:14:27] correct, brother. I know. I know very well. And we will continue with faith because we
[1:14:32] stop in faith. I know exactly. Brother Brandham say got to have a faith that shall change what
[1:14:39] and quicken this body and what be taken away. How can you believe your body can be changed?
[1:14:48] Do you think it's an easy thing? No. Brother Brham says, he says,
[1:14:52] I believe there is a church on its road tonight, a power of what? The living God
[1:15:01] that man will do what? Speak the word. Where? Here and there. And it shall flash like water.
[1:15:08] Lightning. Not God speaking the word. You speaking the word. Not God. You talking
[1:15:20] life and death is where? In the power of the tongue. Who tongue?
[1:15:30] William Marion Brham. Glory to God. Brother Brham said, "But look friend,
[1:15:34] the time is coming that when there is doing what? But rising up a church. If we can't have
[1:15:41] faith for what divine healing, how are we going to have faith for the rapture?
[1:15:52] If your faith is always your remedy, if your faith is always urgent care,
[1:16:00] if your faith is always the hospital,
[1:16:05] which day it's a sensible thing to do, but when are you going
[1:16:09] to climb to a faith that you wake up in the morning and you say headache,
[1:16:16] move out. Yes sir. Without medication. Yes sir. Without worrying about motin affecting my kidneys.
[1:16:30] Without worrying about Tylenol affecting my liver. A medication without side effect.
[1:16:44] Are we together? Amen. Are we together? Amen. Did I rub you the wrong way? If you thought I rub you
[1:16:51] the wrong way, what is coming up is powerful. Brother Brham says we got to do what? Move
[1:16:57] out. Move out. Who, friend? We got to get out of this water. Oh, slow church condition that
[1:17:06] we're in. Do what? Step out and do what? Lunch out. You got to be in office. Yes sir. Yes sir.
[1:17:20] Not defense offense. Yes sir. Yes sir.
[1:17:30] In other word in other word when everything is going good you say devil you too quiet.
[1:17:40] I need to save somebody. I need to pray for somebody. You are on offense.
[1:17:48] That's it right there.
[1:17:52] Are we together? Are we together? My friend from Miami say amen. Don't worry. If you need
[1:17:59] to scream, scream, my friend. Are we together? Amen. Are we together? Amen. Brother Brham say,
[1:18:06] "Cut the water." Shorelines and do what? Get out into somewhere where you lose all senses of water,
[1:18:13] fear and doubt. And out there where all feet are what possible brother just as free as he can be.
[1:18:28] Hallelujah. If you sick, you take your sickness to the hospital. Amen. Amen.
[1:18:38] Are you afraid taking your sickness to the hospital? Brother Brham, Brother Brham says
[1:18:45] this in the message life 1957062 paragraph 151. Brother Brham say am I not mistaken? This is
[1:18:57] sister who? Craig. So, brother Brandham was in church and he looked and he said,
[1:19:05] "I see is that sister Craig or what?" This is what brother Brandham is saying. Why is brother
[1:19:11] Brandham saying that about sister Craig? In other words, the prophet is surprised
[1:19:18] to see Sister Craig in church. Put your seat belt. Amen. Amen. And sister Greg respond. Oh,
[1:19:34] sister Greg say what? Yes. This is me. In other words, sister Greg confirm that brother Brham
[1:19:42] it's me. Why is brother Brandham surprised about a believer being in church? Because when church
[1:19:50] service are open, it's a believer should be there. But brother Brandham sees a Christian,
[1:19:56] a daughter, a sister in church and brother Brandham say a mom is taken. In other words,
[1:20:02] brother Brham didn't think that sister should be where she was.
[1:20:09] What is wrong with sister Craig? Brother Brham say I understand your
[1:20:14] condition. Who? Sister Craig that you got so sick and you had to what? Leave. So,
[1:20:22] brother Brham was surprised that sister Greg being so sick was in service.
[1:20:38] This is not a rebuke. I'm pulling you up. Brother Brham say now look way out there
[1:20:44] in those desert you have done what? Labored away with who? With your husband here for the
[1:20:50] who? the cause of Christ. The very thing that you have stood for, Sister Craig,
[1:20:55] is the only thing that can do what? Help you now. And as God's servant and know that we love you and
[1:21:02] brother Craig here, all of us here at the church and we appreciate your work where in the desert
[1:21:08] among Indian people. So the sister returned from Indian quickly because she got really
[1:21:13] sick. But brother Brandham is surprised he's in church. And brother Brandham say and that
[1:21:19] you come now this is the hospital where this morning. So a church is what? The hospital.
[1:21:32] Brother Isaac say amen. A church is what? The hospital. A church is
[1:21:38] what? The hospital. So the same faith you have for CMC for Noan
[1:21:48] Am I saying something wrong? The same faith you have for CMC, for atrium, for no van, this is also
[1:21:57] a hospital because you're going to see a doctor over there. But we also got a doctor right here.

[1:22:14] is where the physician stand. That what great one not your physician over there

[1:28:14] you. Are we together? And if you don't want to go to the hospital, then take God and his word.
[1:28:29] Are we together? Are we together? A whole message has already been preached. Flight
[1:28:36] attendant, prepare for takeoff. Let's stand for the reading of the word.
[1:28:52] Are we together? Amen. So no rebuke to anyone. Amen. But God is telling
[1:29:02] you the time has come. Yes, there is. Yes, sir. Begin to look higher, higher,
[1:29:07] higher. Yes sir. Absolutely. I appreciate if you want to say you say I'm coughing. No
[1:29:12] problem. We understand that. But if you say you know what I'm coughing, I put a mask. Let me go
[1:29:19] to the church with my mask on. Father, I came with my mask. I don't want to go with my mask.
[1:29:32] I don't want to go there and then somebody else get sick. Neutralize this thing. My friend,
[1:29:38] what happen if you take a fly and you bring him to the fire? The fire will roast the
[1:29:44] fly and the Holy Ghost fly fire will rust your disease. It will barbecue the disease.

[1:30:07] medication, medication, medication, medic. And the pharmacist are making
[1:30:11] money every every winter. Then we start buying Tylenol. Tylenol. It's a circle. Every single
[1:30:24] Are we together? Are we together? Some of you are lost. Are we together? Ah, praise God. Let's
[1:30:34] pray. Heavenly Father, Lord, we are approaching you humbly this morning. Father, thanking you
[1:30:39] for your grace, your love, your mercy, and for healing people based on what we spoke. Father,
[1:30:45] people are touched and they are healed. Not only here but even in invisible audience. Lord,
[1:30:52] this is as far as I can go with the ability you have given me. Father when he come to speaking
[1:30:58] and ministering to your people, he only take the supernatural Holy Ghost to come and take over.
[1:31:03] May you move me out and the audience completely out. May you come and speak to us so Lord Father
[1:31:09] in Jesus precious name. Amen. Let's go to Exodus 34. So everything I spoke, it's not in my time.
[1:31:22] You the one causing all of this. Amen. I was at home. I already finished my sermon
[1:31:28] and then you need to put this. You need to I want to remove leave that. Leave
[1:31:33] that because somebody's doing something and the Holy Spirit is saying so these
[1:31:39] quotes are not coming from me. You the one whatever you doing at home.
[1:31:44] You the one putting quotes here. You the one with 92 part 95. It's you.
[1:31:52] Amen. Amen. My subject this morning it's our life journey through Joseph 5 garment part 92
[1:32:05] and our theme if we can is the 10 pounds. Oh Lord have mercy. I was told not to ask you.
[1:32:17] Can we continue? I was forbidden not to do that. Amen. But when he come in that time,
[1:32:28] when he come in that time, you know what I'm saying? You understand what I'm saying?
[1:32:40] Oh Lord have mercy. You are more free than me. The 10 pound parable season.
[1:32:54] Oh, praise God. In other words, the season of the parable of the 10 pound. Last week,
[1:33:01] it was a mysterious. It's no longer mystery. You understand this now? Now,
[1:33:05] it's the real season. Exodus 34. Let's go. If I have to skip some scripture, I got to skip it.
[1:33:13] Let's go verse one just to give you a clear uh preview quick. And the Lord said to who? Moses,
[1:33:20] you may be seated. You you two tables of stone like the water the first and write upon this table
[1:33:28] and and I will write upon this table the word that were in the water first tables in the first table
[1:33:37] which you broke. So you understand clearly this is the new table without any writing on it. We
[1:33:43] clear so far? Amen. We clear so far. So Moses have to take the stone. You understand what it
[1:33:49] means now? Nothing written in it. Take it all the way to the peak of the mountain where there is a
[1:33:55] cloud and God will come there with a thunder. With thunders. Amen. But Moses is given the ability to
[1:34:05] understand the thunders. Are we together? So when you hearing thunder, Moses is not hearing
[1:34:11] thunders. And Moses take the thunder. Amen. and wrote them over and God begin to write the thunder
[1:34:19] over there. Amen. Amen. Amen. So when you So the thunder moved from a thunder to a written word.
[1:34:32] Amen. Amen. Amen. The stone were only a recording method of that time.
[1:34:44] Don't start like this. we need to move. They didn't have a a a camera to record
[1:34:50] it. So to record, they needed to use a stone. So the stone was only a recording.
[1:35:02] Amen. Amen. So the stone was the recording of the thunder.
[1:35:11] It was a storage. Amen. It was a recording device. Are we together? Are we together? So
[1:35:23] if you want to play, play, push, play, you just pull the stone and you push and the
[1:35:30] stone begin to tell you not the natural thunder but the what the thunder says.
[1:35:40] Are we together? Because God came down upon a cloud. To interpret the thunder,
[1:35:48] God have to come as a cloud on a mountain. Are we together? Amen. Let's go to verse two. And be
[1:35:58] ready when in the morning. And come up where? In the morning to Mount water. So you have to
[1:36:04] be a mountain. And present yourself there to me in the top of water, the mount. Jump to verse uh
[1:36:11] five. And the Lord descended how? In the cloud. Are we clear now? Amen. In the cloud and stood.
[1:36:21] You remember he's standing right there? I don't want to get I mean taken with that standing.
[1:36:26] He's standing with him there and proclaim what? The name of the Lord. We clear so far. Amen. I'm
[1:36:32] skipping again. Let's go to verse 28. Beautiful. And he was there in the mountain with the Lord
[1:36:40] how many days? 40 days. And what? 40 nights. And he did neither eat bread nor water. Drink water.
[1:36:46] And he wrote upon the tables the words of the covenant, the water, the ten commandments. And
[1:36:52] it came to pass when Moses came down from Mount Sana with the two table of the testimony in Moses
[1:37:00] hand when he came down. Amen. In other word, God came down with a cloud and God spoke in
[1:37:11] a thunder. Amen. But the message was not given to Israel. The message was given to a prophet.
[1:37:25] Are we together? It is the prophet that take the message now toward Israel. Amen. Israel
[1:37:33] didn't receive a message directly. I hope we are together. God is talking to Moses
[1:37:41] alone. And giving Moses the message. Amen. And Moses leaving the mountain,
[1:37:48] he live not the way he went. Amen. When Moses is coming back from the mountain,
[1:37:56] Moses is loaded. Amen. Amen. With the message of God for the people. Amen. And that message is the
[1:38:07] thunders of God. Amen. Are we are we together? So Mo Moses no interpretation of thunders.
[1:38:19] I hope we are together. I hope we are together. So the one who came down on the mountain is
[1:38:25] Revelation 10:1. Amen. But the one who went in the mountain is Revelation 10:7. Revelation 10:7
[1:38:34] receive things from the third one and bring it to the bride. Bring it to the people. Amen. And what
[1:38:42] he brings is not the noise but the interpretation of the thunders. Amen. I hope we are together.
[1:38:50] Amen. I hope we are together. Amen. So when Moses is coming with the interpretation of the thunder,
[1:38:57] something happened to his face. We clear now? We are we clear? Amen. Are we clear? Amen. Verse 29.
[1:39:06] And it came to pass when Moses did what? Came down from Mount Si that with the water. Two
[1:39:12] tables of testimony in water. Moses hand. when he came down from the mount that Moses what was
[1:39:19] not that the skin of his face he didn't know that the skin of his face did what shown while
[1:39:24] he talked with him so God anointed or touch or the reflection of God was seen only in the head
[1:39:41] this is Moses nothing reflect ed the glory. Only the head,
[1:39:49] only the head. The head of a prophet.
[1:39:56] Amen. Normally, normally normally this thing should be God himself.
[1:40:06] Normally, it was God himself to go straight to Israel and talk to Israel.
[1:40:13] Amen. But because Israel could not withstand the electricity, the voltage of God. So God have to
[1:40:22] use a veil, he has to borrow, a body and through that body, he reflect himself in an intensity that
[1:40:34] Israel can stand. But even in that intensity, Israel was still afraid. Amen. Are we together?
[1:40:44] Amen. Amen. Verse 30. And when Aaron and all the what? Children of Israel. So who? Moses. Behold,
[1:40:52] the skin of his face did what? Shown. And they were how? Afraid to come nigh him. Job 2:33. And
[1:40:59] until Moses has done speaking with them, he did what? He put a veil on his face. Uh-huh. He put
[1:41:05] a veil on his face. And a a veil on his face. But when Moses went in before the Lord to speak with
[1:41:13] him, he did what? He took the veil off until he came out. Are we together? Amen. So when Moses is
[1:41:19] talking to God, no veil and God is transferring energy. Amen. From himself to Moses. When Moses
[1:41:30] battery is full, are we together? Amen. Moses put the veil and he come down in a mountain. So when
[1:41:41] you see a man coming down with a head veil, just know they got some thunders are there.
[1:41:52] He's bringing the interpretation of the thunders. And when he speak, it is God that is talking. It
[1:42:02] is no more Moses. Amen. I hope we are together. I hope we are together. Verse uh 34. But when Moses
[1:42:14] went in before the Lord to speak with him, this is the third time we're reading this.
[1:42:18] So you should be now saying amen without any problem. Amen. He said he took the veil off
[1:42:24] until he came out. And he came out and spoke to the children of who? Israel. That which
[1:42:30] he was what? Commanded. So when he's coming, he's coming with a command. That's correct,
[1:42:35] brother. Amen. Amen. Verse five. And the children of Israel saw the face of Moses that what? The
[1:42:42] skin of Moses face shown. And Moses put what? The veil upon his face again. Uh-huh. Until he
[1:42:49] went to speak with what? So we found a veil that is veiling ahead of somebody. What does he mean?
[1:42:59] Let's go to second Corinthian 3. And how does this go with the parable of the 10 pound? If
[1:43:08] you give me time, 2 Corinthians chapter 3. If you dare, you can say amen. Verse seven
[1:43:16] and 8. We almost finished. You did very good and I'm proud of you. Congratulations. Amen.
[1:43:23] Verse seven. But if the ministration of what? In other words, the ministry of death written and
[1:43:30] engraved where was how? So that the children of Israel could not steadfastly behold the face of
[1:43:39] Moses for the what? The glory of his countenance. So the veil was blocking the glory. The glory of
[1:43:51] his countenance. Which glory was to be how? turn away. How shall not the ministration or
[1:43:59] the ministry of the spirit be rather than what? Glory. In other word, the word was coming. Moses
[1:44:06] was a shadow. Amen. Moses was a type. Amen. He was only pointing towards something. Amen. And
[1:44:15] what was coming was more powerful. Amen. More glorious than what Moses had. Amen.
[1:44:24] Are we together? Amen. We clear so far? Amen. All right, let's begin our sermon. Yes,
[1:44:30] sir. Yes, sir. We found out that in John chapter 6, buckle up my friend. Verse 70,
[1:44:40] the Bible say Jesus say Jesus answered them and say, "Have I not what? Chosen you 12." Jesus
[1:44:47] chose 12 disciple and he say and one of them is what? The devil. So call is not the end. No sir.
[1:45:00] Many are called but the chosen are we together? He chose 12 but one of them was a devil.
[1:45:12] So the true bread among the disciple was only 11 people. Are we together?
[1:45:20] But be careful. This one here preached the gospel.
[1:45:27] No, that's that's easy for you. Jesus say,
[1:45:30] "Have I not chosen you?" What? One of you is what? A devil. That devil preached the gospel.
[1:45:40] Can you say amen? That devil prayed for the sick. Amen. And the sick got
[1:45:46] healed. Amen. But it was a devil. Are we together? So the ministry
[1:45:53] of the son of man. Are we together? Usually pull two kinds of preacher.
[1:46:05] Can you say amen? Amen. He usually pull two kind of ministry. You will
[1:46:11] see preacher that are true Brad and they will be added that are devils. It's hard
[1:46:20] to say. But be careful. Those devil will preach the message for a while.
[1:46:25] That's right. That's right. Those devil will do miracles. Uh-huh.
[1:46:33] Are we together? Amen. until a certain level. Uhhuh. So be careful with miracle.
[1:46:41] Amen. And healing. Amen. Lord, Lord, have we not cast that out devil? That's right.
[1:46:48] Have we not prophesy? And the Lord say, I never knew you. So the ministry of the
[1:46:55] son of man or in plain word, the message of brother have two kind of preachers.
[1:47:11] He has predestinated preachers and devil preacher. That's why you watch which church you going to.
[1:47:26] Are we together? Judah may preach the gospel and after a while he will deviate.
[1:47:34] After a while, he would detach from the group. Are we together? Are we together?
[1:47:43] Are we together? Because of the problem that was already it's obvious. If you
[1:47:49] detach from the from the message, Amen. you collapse. So, a new invention is coming. It's
[1:47:58] already on where we detach from the message but we stay in the message.
[1:48:09] Yes sir. The p the first the first lineage of Judah was leaving the message and when they
[1:48:16] leave they collapse. They lose everything because the message is what build them up.
[1:48:24] So are they that are still among the group already caught their vision
[1:48:30] that if you publicly denounce the message you will lose your paycheck.
[1:48:40] Can you say amen? So because of that we will stay in the message but don't get the people too deep.
[1:48:53] Give them enough religion, but don't take them in the third pool.
[1:49:02] You don't get me, my friend. Preach, brother. I don't know. Preach to them like Baptist.
[1:49:09] Preach to them like Pentecostal. Preach to them like Methodist. But don't get into the
[1:49:16] mysteries because the mysteries is where life is. Amen. Amen. Keep them warm up.
[1:49:28] Microwave the congregation. Microwave the congregation. Keep the congregation warm up.
[1:49:40] Are we together? Are we together? But don't touch the staff.
[1:49:47] Am I reading a different Bible? Who chose Judah? Who gave Judah
[1:49:53] the ministry? Jesus himself and he himself said, "But it's a devil."
[1:50:05] So if somebody don't like the message, don't worry.
[1:50:09] It's only an indication that the message is right.
[1:50:17] You don't understand me. If everybody that that believe the message, no one
[1:50:23] have refused the message, something is wrong with the message because Jesus Christ is the
[1:50:29] same. Whatever they did to him, they must do it now. When they begin to leave the message,
[1:50:37] we say good stuff. Now we know what we got. Now we got the son of man. Now we know for sure we
[1:50:45] are in the right place because whatever Judah did never influence other disciple.
[1:50:57] I hope we together. I hope we together. In John chapter 6 verse 66 666 it was not only
[1:51:08] the minister the congregation the disciple many of them left Jesus Christ. Why? Because
[1:51:16] he saying except the man eat water and drink water. They had a problem with that mystery.
[1:51:27] Are we together? Are we together? and they begin to leave all of them. And
[1:51:32] Jesus turned around. Amen. He didn't worry about losing people in the congregation.
[1:51:39] He look at the 11. He said, "What are you doing? You are so good."
[1:51:51] Amen. But the spokesman Peter came out. He said, "Why do we go in eternity? Me and you,
[1:51:59] we're dancing together. We come with you. We come from you. Where do we go?
[1:52:09] I don't know if we're together. I don't know if we're together.
[1:52:17] In other word, in other word, what Peter was telling Jesus Christ,
[1:52:22] he said, "Do you know where our address is? Our address is in heaven." So where
[1:52:28] do we go in hell? We don't have an address there.
[1:52:34] Where else should we go? You the only one that have eternal life. Amen. Amen.
[1:52:47] Can you swallow this? I'm just appetizing. Can
[1:52:50] you swallow this? Peter say that without the Holy Ghost,
[1:53:01] Did I say something wrong? Peter got the Holy Ghost on the day of
[1:53:05] Pentecost. In other words, even if you're not born again yet,
[1:53:14] no one can move you from this message
[1:53:21] because it's a matter of the seed. I don't understand everything. I don't know
[1:53:28] everything. But I just know one thing. There is something in me that love this message.
[1:53:39] Amen. Amen. Are we together? Are we together? Are we together? Are we together?
[1:53:52] I have chosen you to have One of you is a devil.
[1:53:57] So don't be surprised in the group that is called from God. Devils are there.
[1:54:06] I didn't call them devil. Jesus say devil. Son of hell. Son of
[1:54:15] predestination. Are we together? And if you notice he always attached to money.
[1:54:26] All he worry about is ti and offering. It's a paycheck,
[1:54:33] but it's not about the soul. He's warming the message because of a paycheck.
[1:54:44] Are we together? Are we together? In John 13, Jesus looked at Judah. He said,
[1:54:52] "Whatever you want to do, Jesus didn't say, "Brother, why are you leaving the message,
[1:54:59] brother? You don't understand this truth." He say, "No, I know what you want to do. Do it."
[1:55:06] And do it how? Quickly. In other words, make your show quickly. Amen. Put it on YouTube quickly. Put
[1:55:15] it on YouTube quickly. When you finish with all your evidence and stupidity, then the word unfold.
[1:55:31] Are we together? Are we together? Are we together? Now when Judah is out,
[1:55:40] go visit. Go search your Bible. Jesus never called the disciple children. Only when Judah was out,
[1:55:48] when Judah was out, he said, "Children, because he knew now these are mine." Uh, all that the father
[1:55:56] given me, I will lose none except Judah. Are we together? So when Judah left the message, sir.
[1:56:09] When he left the message, now Jesus came back again. Yes. He says that ye have not what chosen
[1:56:17] me but I have what chosen you. Why is he repeating choosing again? He already said choosing in John
[1:56:24] 6. Now he comes back and say you know what you didn't choose me. I am the one that look at the
[1:56:32] at the at the at the whole sheet and I cut you off. And I say I pull this. This is the bride.
[1:56:41] Amen. I am the one that chose you and did what? Ordained you that you should do what? Go bring
[1:56:47] forth fruit. Bring forth water. Fruit. If you are bringing fruit, where is the fruit? Inside
[1:56:54] of you. The fruit only come out. The fruit must be first in you for you to bring fruit. And the
[1:57:01] fruit is a seed. And a seed tells your nature. Are we together? So when you bringing the fruit,
[1:57:09] it shows the nature of the tree that you are. Are we together? Amen. And brother Brham said
[1:57:17] the fruit was the word. Amen. So you must be the word to produce the word. Amen. Because
[1:57:25] every seed must reproduce after its own kind. Are we together? Amen. Are we together? Amen.
[1:57:35] We clear so far now. Amen. Let's go to Luke 19 where we were in our parable where we left off.
[1:57:44] You're doing very good today. Are we together? Let's go to Luke 19 verse uh 11. Amen. Remember
[1:57:56] this parable is in the house of Zakius. It's a parable in the house of a rich man.
[1:58:07] Jesus went to the rich man house. Yes, sir. And from the rich man house,
[1:58:13] he came up with a parable of money from the rich man house. Amen. Is my Bible different? Verse one
[1:58:23] said uh uh who uh Zakius verse two he says Zakius which was a chief among the publican he was what?
[1:58:32] He was in this house. Instead of Jesus using other different parable, he begin to use money.
[1:58:40] In a rich man house amen. Okay. Verse 11. And as they heard these things,
[1:58:49] he did what? Added and spoke. After he spoke about Zakius, I'm just touching so we come up. After
[1:58:56] they heard these things, he added and spoke what? A parable. Because he was near what? to Jerusalem
[1:59:03] and because they thought that the kingdom of God should immediately have appeared. Remember last
[1:59:10] Sunday we told you the expectation of the Jews. The Jews were waiting for the Messiah to come and
[1:59:17] deliver them from the Roman Empire. But at that time Rome was a nion. Yes, it was. Remember the
[1:59:27] image of Nebuchadnezzar. First you got gold and then you got the brass and got you got the silver
[1:59:35] and then after the silver you got two feet the Roman west and east Roman sir. Are we together?
[1:59:42] And the two Roman were at that time iron. But the Bible said that the stone came came from the
[1:59:50] mountain and that stone never hit the head. I hope we are together. He never hit the chest. He never
[1:59:58] hit the hips. He never hit even the leg. He went to the feet. The feet is when Rome have changed.
[2:00:09] Please keep your seat belts. Rome have changed from a pagan Rome to a paper Rome. Because at
[2:00:17] that time Rome was dominating everybody. But today Rome is not dominating everybody. It is the United
[2:00:24] States that is dominating everybody. Are we together? But the storm will come when Rome is
[2:00:31] dominating everybody. Not in the national level, but in the spiritual level. Where iron and clay
[2:00:40] are mixed together. I hope we are together. Please keep your seat belt. I'm climbing,
[2:00:46] my friend. I hope we are together. I hope we are together. I hope we are together. So when Jesus
[2:00:54] was born, everybody knew he was a king. He was a birth of a king. The major say, "Where is the
[2:01:03] king of the Jews?" We have seen his star. The star of the king. And we have come to do what? Are we
[2:01:12] together? Are we together? So when Jesus is going to Jerusalem, everybody say that's it. Now finally
[2:01:20] the Roman we are finished with you. So everybody's getting ready for Jesus to become the new king and
[2:01:26] take over Israel and restore Israel to the time of Solomon. Because a greater than Solomon was here.
[2:01:37] When he say greater than Solomon was here. In other words, I am the God that I have come here.
[2:01:42] Is said praise the Lord. Now we will be free. Are we together? Are we together? This belief was so
[2:01:51] strong even among the disciple of Jesus Christ. Are we together? And this is the reason why the
[2:02:00] Bible is saying in verse 11 that Jesus wanted to correct them. Yes sir. Yes sir. Jesus wanted to
[2:02:09] refocus them. Jesus wanted to give them the proper sequence of things before he rule as
[2:02:21] a king. He was born a king but he was not coming to rule as a king yet he was not coming to take
[2:02:31] over the kingdom of the world. Are we together? And the disciple had a hard time. Amen. Jesus
[2:02:39] is explaining this before his death. But after Jesus is dead, still the disciples struggle. Yes,
[2:02:47] they did. The Bible says this, my friend, in the book of Luke 24, let's stay focused,
[2:02:53] my friend. Verse 18, and the one of them whose name was who? Cleopus. Answering. I put this
[2:02:59] to help you so you don't have to flip pages. So, I was the one working on your on your place. So
[2:03:05] all you have to do is chill out and focus. Are we together? Amen. He says answering say unto him,
[2:03:12] "Are thou the art are thou only a what? A stranger in Jerusalem and has not known these things which
[2:03:17] are come to pass in the water in these days." And he says unto them, "What things?" Like he
[2:03:23] didn't know what he was asking. Amen. And they say unto him concerning who? Jesus of Nazareth,
[2:03:31] which was what? A prophet. How? mighty indeed and word before God and what and all the people had
[2:03:38] the chief priest and the ruler did what? Delivered him to be condemned to death and have done what?
[2:03:43] Have crucified him. But we trusted we trusted that he had been he Jesus Christ which should
[2:03:52] have what? Redeemed Israel. The word redeem means deliver Israel. That's right. Amen. Are
[2:03:59] we together? In other words, they were going sad because Jesus told them, "Why are you sad?
[2:04:05] What kind of conversation do you have? You don't know what happened. What happened? This Jesus,
[2:04:12] in other words, our hope, we thought this is the man that will come and deliver Israel." But
[2:04:20] now it's three days and we hearing some women are telling us Jesus look at them, he say, "You fools.
[2:04:29] Are we together? Are we together? Because they still believe that the Messiah was supposed to
[2:04:38] deliver Israel. I hope we are together. I hope we are together. When Jesus display himself and
[2:04:46] all the disciples show him saw him, he came up. He said, "All power in heaven and earth is given
[2:04:52] unto him." The disciples say that's it. Now all power in heaven and earth is given on him. So
[2:04:59] now ah we got it in the book of acts chapter one verse 6 the bible say when they therefore
[2:05:07] will come how together they ask of him after the resurrection they say lord will thou at this time
[2:05:15] do what? Restore again the kingdom to Israel. So still they're saying wait a minute. So now that
[2:05:22] all power in heaven and earth is given unto you. So now this is the time that you going
[2:05:29] to restore the kingdom of Israel. Are we together? Are we together? Are we together? Job to verse 12,
[2:05:38] my friend. Verse 12. And he said, therefore, he's correcting their expectation. A certain
[2:05:46] what? Noble man. Remember noble man is a noble birth. A noble man. Amen. Amen. From a noble
[2:05:55] birth. And another translation in the Greek say he was royal. A man of royalty. Amen. Amen. A noble
[2:06:05] man went into a what? Far country. I gave you the quote again during the week. Far country means
[2:06:11] what? Heaven. Amen. So he's telling them, listen, the noble man must go to heaven. Are we together?
[2:06:21] To a far country to receive what? For himself a kingdom and to do what? Return. So he was crowned
[2:06:29] here with stone. Yes. Amen. Because they rejected his kingdom. I'm going to get to that. Amen. But
[2:06:37] he need to be crowned king. When are we together? So he's telling them that the expectation you
[2:06:45] waiting it's not now. I must first go to heaven. And when I'm going to heaven, I'm going in the
[2:06:54] royal lineage of David. Then when I get there, I will be crowned. I will receive a kingdom. Are we
[2:07:03] together? And when I receive the kingdom, I will come back. So when he's coming back, he's coming
[2:07:11] back as a king. I hope we are together. I hope we are together. He's coming back in Revelation 19,
[2:07:20] King of King, Lord of Lord, with a crown and everything. And he's coming to take over. The
[2:07:26] kingdom of this world will become the kingdom of our Lord. Are we all together? Are we together?
[2:07:33] Now listen to this. When they ask him a question, they say, "Will you at this time restore again the
[2:07:40] kingdom of water to Israel?" And he says unto them, "It is not for you to know what the times
[2:07:47] and the what or the seasons." Do you see the word season? Which the father has put where?
[2:07:52] In his own power. But but follow me carefully. Ye shall receive what? Power. In other words, he's
[2:08:02] telling them, "Hey, you don't have to worry about the restoration. What you need to focus on now,
[2:08:11] listen, my friend, let's focus here. Let's let's focus here. This is a surgery, my friend." Amen.
[2:08:22] The disciple were coming again. They said, "Listen, now all power are given to you.
[2:08:28] So you will restore the kingdom. Now in other words, are we going to take the White House
[2:08:32] right now? He says, "No, leave the White House alone." There are time and season
[2:08:39] that are there. What you need to focus right now is I'm going to deliver something to you.
[2:08:48] Amen. There is something that I'm going to give you. I'm going I'm going to give you something. I
[2:08:56] hope we are together. In other words, focus on what I'm going to give you and leave the time
[2:09:02] alone. I hope we are together. Are we together? Brother, the Bible say, "But ye shall do what?
[2:09:12] Receive power." Receive power. Remember the word power? After what? That the Holy Ghost
[2:09:18] has come upon you. So the Holy Ghost is going to come. And when the Holy Ghost come, he will
[2:09:24] give you power. Power. Follow me, my friend. Amen. After the Holy Ghost is come upon you,
[2:09:30] and ye shall be what? Witnesses where? Unto me where? Both in Jerusalem and water and in all
[2:09:36] Judea and water in all Samaria and to what? uttermost part of the earth. In other words,
[2:09:41] before we talk about me ruling, the gospel must go everywhere. Amen. I hope we are together. Amen.
[2:09:49] The gospel must be preached to every nation. When the gospel is preached to every nation,
[2:09:55] Then the end will come. Amen. I hope we are together. Amen. Are we together? Are we together?
[2:10:03] And when he had spoken what these things while they did what? Beheld. He was what? Take it up.
[2:10:10] He took his journey. He get into the jet. When he finished, he said, "Hey, I already told you I'm
[2:10:17] going to a far away country." He get into a jet. The Bible say he was taken up and what? Clouds did
[2:10:24] what? received him out of their sight. So he went into a far country. Yes, sir. Are we together?
[2:10:32] But for me to return, are we together? Yes. Are we together? The gospel must go everywhere. Are
[2:10:39] we together? We clear so far? But when Jesus came, what did he bring? Yes, ma'am. The Bible
[2:10:49] says this in the book of Galatians 3:23. But before what? Faith came. So faith was not there
[2:10:58] yet. All right. That's correct. Amen. Before faith came. Amen. There was a faith that was supposed to
[2:11:05] come. Are we together? Some of you don't have work tomorrow. Let's focus. There is a faith that was
[2:11:12] supposed to come. But Paul is saying before that faith came. Follow me. Amen. Before faith came,
[2:11:23] This pound here in the parable was money. And we found out last week that money was faith. Now,
[2:11:34] now we clear. Amen. But before faith came. Are we together? We were kept what? Under the law.
[2:11:42] How? Shut up into unto the faith. We were shut up. We were locked onto waiting for the faith
[2:11:51] which should what afterwards be revealed. So when Jesus Christ came, Jesus brought
[2:11:57] that faith. That faith was crushed. I hope we together. I hope we are together. My friend,
[2:12:09] this is a surgery. Are we together? So when Jesus Christ came, he didn't just come like that. He
[2:12:16] brought faith. Are we together? But before he leave, he must leave something to the servant.
[2:12:26] I hope we are together. I hope we are together. Job to verse 13. Job to verse 13. The Bible say,
[2:12:36] "And he called what? His 10 servants." How many servant do we have? 10 servants. 10 servant and
[2:12:42] did what? And delivered them 10 pounds. He delivered them 10 pound. How many servant
[2:12:47] do we have? 10 servant. How many pound do we have? 10. 10 divided by 10 equal what?
[2:12:53] One. So one pound per servant. Follow me my friend. Are we together? One pound per servant.
[2:13:03] One pound per servant. Are we together? Amen. And we find out that what he delivered them. Brother
[2:13:09] Brham say he was faith because faith came with Jesus Christ. And look on the verse 13 the Bible
[2:13:18] say and he called the what? His 10 servants. His 10 servant and did what? Delivered them.
[2:13:25] Stop. And did what? Delivered them. And did what? Delivered. Which word is used there? Delivered.
[2:13:34] The word that is used there is delivered. Uhhuh. Follow me church. Amen. Amen. Watch
[2:13:42] Jude chapter one. The Bible say, "Beloved, when I gave all what?" Diligence. To write unto you
[2:13:51] of what? The common salvation. It was needful for me to write unto you and to exalt that you should
[2:13:58] what? Earnestly content for the faith. Content for the what? Faith. That was what? Was what?
[2:14:05] Delivered unto the saints. I don't hear amen from there. The church that was on was what? Delivered.
[2:14:18] How many times was he delivered? He was once delivered and he goes away because
[2:14:25] faith came with Jesus Christ. But before Jesus goes to heaven,
[2:14:32] are we together? He took faith and delivered one time for the church.
[2:14:42] And Jude is saying fight for that faith. Content.
[2:14:53] You don't get me. Brother Brandham, brother Brandham preach the faith that was once delivered
[2:15:00] to the saints like five or six sermon. Go listen to that. Content is not like brother Charles,
[2:15:08] please don't preach those things. Content is to fight to stand for that faith.
[2:15:21] L content content is not brothers and sisters in love. We need to preach the
[2:15:31] message. Why we going away from the message? That's not contending. Content is we need
[2:15:39] to get back in line. Let's go back to the message. Let's bring the message.
[2:15:48] Give me the message or nothing. We need to stand and fight.
[2:15:57] I don't know if we together.
[2:16:01] Why do you fight for it? Because God delivered. It's a delivery. When something is delivered,
[2:16:10] it means he was sent for your address for you. It was
[2:16:20] You don't really get what I'm saying.
[2:16:25] I don't have any choice. Sister Tza buy something on Amazon. Amazon and she bought her dress. Yes.
[2:16:32] And her dress come and they deliver her the dress and she get her dress and you come you
[2:16:38] say give me that dress. What will sister say? That's your dress. If you continue I
[2:16:45] call the police because I I must contact it's for me. It is my dress. It's delivered for me.
[2:16:58] I understand my friend maybe some of you this message is not for you but
[2:17:04] to me I will send you Elijah Elijah the prophet Elijah will stand with
[2:17:11] a package to give it to me and when I receive it don't you touch the message.
[2:17:24] I don't know if you understand. Don't never come in my house and touch the
[2:17:29] message of brother. I will open up the door and say leave. Don't you
[2:17:35] never stand here and blab about the message of brother. I must fight for the message.
[2:17:45] Are we together? Are we together? Because the faith was delivered how many time? Once. And
[2:17:52] Malachi 4 have to restore because he was already delivered. He must
[2:17:58] only bring you back. Restore you back to the faith that was once delivered.
[2:18:10] Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[2:18:16] Because the faith was given only one time, not twice, one time. Because it's hidden one time,
[2:18:23] you only have one shot. So protect it. Fight for it. Cherish it.
[2:18:37] You don't understand what I'm saying. You don't understand what I'm saying.
[2:18:41] You get on the airport at the airport. You get you get your your boarding pass
[2:18:47] and you get that boarding pass and you already cross all the taking off the
[2:18:50] shoes and everything and you already there and you lose the boarding pass.
[2:18:56] You can say all you want. We need another boarding pass. So I already got one boarding pass. I can't
[2:19:03] play with it because it's my flight. It is my flight. I can't miss this flight. This
[2:19:12] flight of rapture. I can't miss it for you. I won't miss it for you. I must fight for it.
[2:19:25] I hope we are together. I hope we are together. Amen. I hope we are together.
[2:19:29] Amen. I hope we are together. That's why when we crossing game with the message,
[2:19:35] I have zero tolerance because it was given to me once and God already restore
[2:19:43] it back. So why should I play with it again? Who's going to restore it again?
[2:19:52] Are we together? Are we together? We clear so far. We clear so far. He took the money and he gave it.
[2:20:01] Verse uh uh 13. And he called his 10 servant and delivered them how many pounds? 10. And say unto
[2:20:08] them, do what? Occupy till I come. So the master, the noble man didn't want his servant to be add.
[2:20:26] Some of you I feel I don't understand. The noble man didn't want when he's away the servant just
[2:20:34] sit down doing nothing. No, he wanted his he wanted his servant to be working. Yes, sir. Yes,
[2:20:44] sir. But he got to give them something to work with. And he delivered the pound. And he said,
[2:20:52] "Do business." Amen. It is my business. But I put my business in you. Do my business when you work.
[2:21:00] When I'm away, I hope we are together. In other words, the pan was never given to stay at all.
[2:21:15] Are we together? Are we together? This faith that we talking about was not given to you.
[2:21:22] Yes. So you put it like this and you say, "Wow, this is a good water. It is
[2:21:29] deer park. It looks so good." No, he was not given for that. He was given to work.
[2:21:41] In other word, when God gave the faith, he automatically put to put the church
[2:21:47] to business. The father's business. Amen. The father's business. The business of the father
[2:21:59] when I'm away before I come back. When I come back, that's why the Bible say God will answer
[2:22:07] his elect that cry unto him how but when the son of man cometh shall he find he need to
[2:22:17] find faith. Are we together? When he's coming, he need to find faith. Because he deliver faith.
[2:22:26] He need to find faith. Are we together? So when Jesus is the way, the servant must get to work.
[2:22:41] Catch it right there, brother. Are we together? Are we together? Uhoh.
[2:22:49] We found out that the pound means what? I gave you the verse. It's verse 20 and
[2:22:56] 23. It means what? And then we find that money was what? This is where we stop.
[2:23:08] Amen. I was told not to ask you a question, but you know what I'm saying. Can I continue?
[2:23:18] Can Can I continue? I have not looked at my clock yet. Can I continue? I didn't
[2:23:26] You know you You need to You know what I'm saying? Amen. Amen. Amen.
[2:23:34] Are we together? Oh, come on, man. What is coming is powerful, but you must be enough.
[2:23:46] Are you promise you're going to be alive? Are you promising? Do you promise? Brother Enoch,
[2:23:54] did you promise? Okay. Brother Enoch say yes.
[2:24:00] Brother Tine smile. So everything is good. Are we together? Brother Brandham says this. I'm going to
[2:24:07] read this quick. Let's go. Brother Benjamin. He says, "Then he had a what? A little scrap
[2:24:14] bit. A loot script bag and not only that but the script bag really in one pocket he carries
[2:24:19] what? Money. And the script means what? Money. So he carries what? Money in. What is it? What
[2:24:25] is that? The money is what? A purchase of power. In other word if you needs to get something you
[2:24:33] need first to get money. Yes sir. Because money is vague. Money can become what your desire says.
[2:24:47] I told you. I told you. Stay focused.
[2:24:53] Money is the means is the channel that operate your desire.
[2:25:07] Are we together? Amen. Brother Mickey want to eat a salmon because he love
[2:25:13] fish with like me. Brother Mickey want to eat a salmon. Amen. This is brother
[2:25:19] Mickey right here. I'm just giving an idea. There's a desire of brother
[2:25:23] Mickey right here. And the desire is a salmon. Amen. But salmon means diero.
[2:25:35] Can you say amen? Amen. Then the salmon have to grow through money. Amen. Amen.
[2:25:43] Amen. So when salmon is when brother Mickey get money, Amen. Brother Mickey will take his
[2:25:50] desire and associate or couple the desire with the money he got with the $20 he got.
[2:26:00] Are we together? Now the $20 is no longer $20. The $20 became a potential sermon,
[2:26:13] my friend. We will break this down until a baby will scream amen. Are we together? Are
[2:26:23] we together? Amen. Amen. Once once Solomon is connected to money, this is no more money. No,
[2:26:34] it become a potential. It become a substance. A substance salmon. I'm teaching you something that
[2:26:48] we all struggle for years. He become the substance salmon. Are we together? Are we together? Amen.
[2:26:57] This substance salmon. Are we together? Are we together? This substance here first bring peace
[2:27:09] to brother and Mickey.
[2:27:14] Be careful for nothing. But he never think by what and what? With what? And the peace.
[2:27:29] I I don't know if we get there. Brother Mickey will say, "I need salmon. I need salmon. I need
[2:27:34] salmon. I mean salmon." Then sister Rose Mary take 20 dollar bill and say, "Brother Mickey,
[2:27:41] here we go." When brother Mickey receive the $20. Are we together? Brother Mickey worries is gone.
[2:27:54] So money kills worry. Money kills worry. Faith kill worry.
[2:28:06] Are we together? Are we together? Amen. Are we together? Amen. And
[2:28:11] after bringing peace to brother Mickey, do you follow me? He also bring confession.
[2:28:22] I don't know if we together. In other words,
[2:28:25] brother Mickey can turn around and say, "Listen, I got my salmon."
[2:28:32] Not I need the salmon, but I got my salmon.
[2:28:42] Church, are we together? Shake somebody. I don't
[2:28:47] like people sitting quietly. This ain't the time to be sitting around like you.
[2:28:58] If you if we fine everybody clear now. So he brought it changes now the vocabulary
[2:29:06] of brother Mickey. Now brother Mickey is no longer worrying about salmon but his worry
[2:29:14] is to get to launch to launch to attack to attack to to move forward where someone is
[2:29:31] I don't know if we together I don't know if we are together brother Brham is saying this
[2:29:39] in other word your money can be custom to a dress that's right to a water that's right
[2:29:45] to a car to a house that's right to whatever to a medical bill whatever It's just money
[2:29:54] but it can be many things. Amen. And it can take the form of your desire.
[2:30:03] It can be immortal and become your desire. It is faith. Faith can become your desire. Jesus. I hope
[2:30:17] we are together. Brother Brandham says this. He says, he says it is what? Purchase power.
[2:30:24] Here is what God's script bag. Each traveler or what shepherd out there has a what? A script
[2:30:29] bag. So now if you want something where out of there some what? Purchasing power. If you
[2:30:34] are what? Sick. Do what do you do? Reach down here and do what? And let's see what I got in
[2:30:39] the script bag. What is in the script bag? I'm the Lord that health thee. Brother is calling
[2:30:44] that money. But I'm the Lord that he thee is a scripture. A scripture. It's a promise.
[2:30:54] Are we together? But it's a promise that is given to you in a time of a need.
[2:31:10] When you were healthy, when you were healthy, you won't hear this. No. Because everything is
[2:31:16] good. But when you begin to go then you hear something say I am the Lord. That's
[2:31:23] it. Are we are we together? So money is a promise word. A promise a scripture
[2:31:35] my friend. Amen. A word that is that is given. Amen. in timel of a specific need.
[2:31:52] Amen. And if you notice that word will match the problem. Yes, sir.

[2:32:13] work with me, I'm going to get to the Holy Ghost and you will see what the problem is with the Holy
[2:32:20] Ghost. Last Sunday, you block me. So, let's try to move. Are we together? Ah, and all take it
[2:32:28] power to buy. Whatsoever that you do what believer when you pray, believe you have what? Receive what

[2:32:53] You I was starving and a loaf of bread will save water my life and I will ask for water the bread
[2:32:58] and some man will give me water 25 cents. And that is the purchase price of water a loaf of bread. I
[2:33:05] just explained it right here. I can be just as how happy doing water. holding the 25 cents in my hand
[2:33:11] as I as as I can with a loaf of bread because it is what the purchasing power then I guarded I have
[2:33:19] not got bread but I got what the purchasing power well that is what faith we clear down brother
[2:33:27] Brandham say when you can pray until you get what the assurance you can be just how as happy if the
[2:33:36] cancer is gone shout just How? As loud. Continue. Because you got the purchase powerh, the faith
[2:33:44] that moves the thing. Then you're persevering. No one can tell you anything different. You remember
[2:33:49] brother Charles, no one can tell you anything different. Doesn't matter what anybody say.
[2:33:55] You got what? Then crossed over the sound barrier. You are how? Freeing, purchased,
[2:34:00] and being what? Persistent. This is where we stop. Let's pick up now. Brother Brandham says,

[2:34:17] what? Your faith. I hope we are together. Your faith is the purchasing of what? Your healing.
[2:34:26] Your faith can purchase your healing. Yes sir. Your faith can buy healing. It can get healing.
[2:34:39] Amen. Don't worry my friend. Brother says, "See, it is what the substance of things
[2:34:45] hoped for. The what? The evidence of things not seen. You don't have to feel nothing.
[2:34:55] Brother, the problem in this message. Yes, sir. Amen. Is the problem of feeling.
[2:35:07] When you come to the pastor to pray for you when we lay hand unconsciously you are expectant to
[2:35:15] feel something. That's it. That's it. Don't say amen. I'm a human being too. I'm not an
[2:35:21] angel. Unconsciously you are expecting to even feel something warm. If it's warm you say that
[2:35:28] prayer work. Oh if you feel you say h it get are we together and the minister themsself get
[2:35:36] into that until the minister begin to produce that. Hallelujah. And then you are shaking
[2:35:48] church. We need to climb you up.
[2:35:52] And the Pentecost will go with you like this until you fall. And when you fall,
[2:35:58] you come up nothing. But the faith I'm preaching now, you don't have to feel anything.
[2:36:09] I don't know if you get what I'm saying. In other words, you don't have to rely on your body. No,
[2:36:17] sir. To tell you whether you got it or not. No sir. You don't feel anything, but it's there.
[2:36:29] In the beginning was what? The word. That word was logos. And the Bible say everything that was
[2:36:36] created was created by that. Amen. So God created the world without the body of Jesus Christ.
[2:36:48] God didn't get in the body of Jesus Christ to begin to create. No, he was outside. So,
[2:36:53] his faith was without a a a a physical body.
[2:37:00] Are we together? Are we together? Are we together? You don't have
[2:37:06] to feel water? Nothing. You don't have to taste water? Nothing. Only
[2:37:10] thing you have to do is what? to believe something. You are believing something.
[2:37:19] I'm I'm going to help you. He said believing something and it and it
[2:37:24] becomes how a positive something that you do what? Possess. That is
[2:37:29] what your faith. So faith have nothing to do with your feeling. Amen. Amen.
[2:37:41] Father, help me. Amen. Amen. We behave more like Pentecostal than we think. Yes, sir. Amen. We go
[2:37:50] to the prayer line and I will get you to prayer line. We go to the prayer line. The first person
[2:37:55] on the floor, everybody behind. For me to receive something, I must be falling on the floor. Then
[2:38:05] you come next. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. You don't feel anything as you're living. But why
[2:38:14] is so and so falling on the but me? Lord, what is wrong with you? There is nothing wrong with
[2:38:26] We were just misled too much.
[2:38:31] That's it. Are we together? Are we together?
[2:38:38] The Bible, brother Brandham say, "So what is the evidence of your healing when you
[2:38:45] believe it?" No matter what takes place, you say what? I don't feel better. Let me
[2:38:52] check the time. Because uh I don't want any problem. Amen. No matter what takes place,
[2:38:59] you say what? I don't feel better. Don't have nothing to do with it. You got what?
[2:39:06] The purchase power. You do what? Believe it. You just start what? Dancing a little jig.
[2:39:23] Don't worry. Some of you are humble. Very humble. It's not your nature.
[2:39:34] Your nature is calmer. But brother say you start
[2:39:38] what? Dancing a little J. Go remove it from the message.
[2:39:48] That's your problem. It's not my nature. You are doing again Jesus in your special way. Who?
[2:40:00] Papa, you made possible.
[2:40:06] You will do it again. Jesus in your special way. What seem simple.
[2:40:20] Those are the song of people that have faith.
[2:40:28] Are we together? My friend, if you a devil around me, you trouble. I will make you uncomfortable.
[2:40:41] Brother, brother say you start a little jig saying what? Praise God. I'm going
[2:40:46] to be where? Because I got what the purchasing power. There you are. He's
[2:40:54] able. He's able. He's able. He's able. He's able. He's able. Whatever you want,
[2:41:00] He's able. Whatever you say, He's able. Whatever you desire, He's able.
[2:41:12] Are we together? Are we together? Are we together? Amen. Flight attendant,
[2:41:20] prepare for landing. We can continue. Let me let me strike something and we go my friend.
[2:41:26] Are we together? Are we together? That was the first level of faith and you passed
[2:41:32] the test. All of you 100. So let me bring the second level of faith. You can swallow
[2:41:38] that. Are you going to swallow it? Brother Brandham say now faith will do just anything.
[2:41:51] L
[2:41:54] I told you faith is the precious power. It can change money. Faith
[2:42:00] the money of God. Faith will do how? Anything that you have what leader
[2:42:08] of being done if you suggest what? Put it to work. Yes sir. Yes sir. Occupy,
[2:42:20] occupy, occupy. Delivery faith, but occupy. Put it to work. Put it to work.
[2:42:36] My friend,
[2:42:39] my friend, you won't need healing in heaven. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[2:42:53] Don't worry, I'm pushing 10. Brother Brandham says the totality of the pound are 10 pound.
[2:43:00] So I'm pushing 10 and you will see what happen. Brother Brandham say faith will do just water.
[2:43:06] Anything and will do anything that you have of need of being done if you do water. Put it to
[2:43:12] work. But most churches today in the message that is as far as they teach just do what?
[2:43:22] Accept Jesus by faith and that settles it. That is like a man was that is like a man was that
[2:43:31] was eating a slice of water watermelon. He said that was good but there is water some more of it
[2:43:38] somewhere. So that is the way it is to accept Christ is what good but there is more to it
[2:43:50] believe the message I believe the message I'm baptized that's no no brother say and
[2:43:58] then when a man do what accept Christ as what his personal savior then all the good things
[2:44:10] Oh no, no, no, no, no. You are humble. Some of the good things, all the water,
[2:44:18] all the good things. You who love trial, all the bad things, no sir. All the water,
[2:44:29] all the good things. The Christ has what promise is laying right at what? fingertips.
[2:44:40] You don't know.
[2:44:45] Everything you need of is where? What do you do with a fingertip? Push the button.
[2:44:55] It's a nap. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Are we together? Every good thing that God has promised is
[2:45:04] laying where? Right at his fingertips. Just to do what? Believe it. Brother
[2:45:09] Brandham continue. He says here, "After this meeting is over, if God willing,
[2:45:15] we take our vacation, Sister Sharon, and go up in the mountains to hunt. What good? Oh,
[2:45:22] sorry. What good did he do that man to give him a gun if he's not going to use it?
[2:45:37] God save you. God heal you. The seven thunders the mystery of
[2:45:42] God. What good is those mysteries? If the mystery don't become life,
[2:45:55] are we together? It says it is standing there a water find God
[2:46:01] but it shall never do no good unless water he uses it. That is the way your faith is.
[2:46:11] I don't know if you get me. When I tell the young man, I say go walk around where they
[2:46:18] building new houses. Some of you don't listen. You going to that town. Go where new houses are.
[2:46:29] You must put it to work. You must push it to work.
[2:46:40] You don't understand what I'm saying. A grown up young man. You see a new neighborhood.
[2:46:49] How are you doing, sir? I want to see the models.
[2:46:54] He will begin to work to bring a new anointing on you.
[2:47:02] He put you in the channel.
[2:47:10] I don't know if we together. Brother said that is the way your faith is. Oh,
[2:47:17] it is a what? Find faith. You do what? You read. You do what? believe and you have a
[2:47:22] what? An experience with God and you believe. Yeah. But faith without work is how dead.
[2:47:33] I hope we are together. Faith without work is what? Don't worry. I'm going to
[2:47:38] the airport. Put it to where? To work. Don't be suffering.
[2:47:54] Are we together? Are we together? Brother Brandham says this. He says, "And now if people would put
[2:48:05] if people would do what? If the church would put more do what?
[2:48:13] That's the word. You would see more things taking place in the church.
[2:48:35] Listen to me. Listen to me. I don't care what your problem is. I don't
[2:48:41] care how difficult it is. I don't care how impossible it is. I don't
[2:48:48] care how no one ever come out of your out of your situation. I don't care if no one
[2:48:56] have a testimony of your case yet. I don't care. My point is for you to put the work
[2:49:13] My friend, my friend, aren't you tired of your brain?
[2:49:22] You go to the doctor, the doctor tells you clearly that there is nothing we can do with
[2:49:28] this. You will stay on medication the rest of your life. In other words, the doctor told you,
[2:49:35] "I'm done with you. And then you sit like this. No. And you accept that.
[2:49:44] Come on. If you don't, it is my time to put it to work.
[2:49:55] I will say doctor, doctor, I appreciate you. I thank you for being a good doctor.
[2:50:02] But I want to tell you one thing. I will come back with a testimony.
[2:50:08] I will come back to testify that my God is alive.
[2:50:20] I hope we are together. I hope we are together. I hope we are together.
[2:50:29] If not, if not, forget about rapturing faith.
[2:50:39] Brother Tony, I'm going to open the tire and I'm going to come down. Are we together? Your prayer
[2:50:45] will be answered soon. I'm going to open the tire and as I'm coming down together
[2:50:55] are we together? Are we together? Come on. Come on. The Bible brother say he says if the
[2:51:03] people would put on if the church if spoken word visible an invisible audience will put
[2:51:22] if the fellow next to you don't want to get it tell him you were not born in
[2:51:27] the same day like me. You came on your own birthday and let me deal with my own life.
[2:51:35] If you're not interested, I am. It's talking about me. He says if the church will put more
[2:51:42] what? Faith to work. To what? To work. You would see what more things taking
[2:51:47] place in the church. The pastor must stand on Sunday. Which Sunday? Morning. He must
[2:51:54] stand on Sunday what evening or what? whatever and preach hard on faith in
[2:52:00] a mighty message. But but if the member don't take the message and stop putting it to work.
[2:52:28] Are we together? Are we together? I'm here
[2:52:32] sweating. But if you don't take it and put it to work
[2:52:42] and put it to work and put it to work, it shall do what? Fall right back. And the birds of the
[2:52:48] air will pick it up. The bird of the air is the devil. It's in the parable. See? See?
[2:52:57] Just do what? Take it out. And do what? and put it to work. God want you to do it. Amen.
[2:53:07] Take the P, occupy. Take the P, occupy. Amen. Get to business.
[2:53:25] Are we together? Amen. Are we together? Amen. Are we together? Amen. Are we together? Amen.
[2:53:31] Don't leave your faith idol. Thank you, Lord. Because in the parable,
[2:53:36] I will show you later who left the faith. Jesus call him a wicked one. Jesus call
[2:53:45] him a wicked one. Somebody who doesn't put faith in action.
[2:53:51] Are we together? Are we together? If I would have waited to get all
[2:53:57] the money to start this building, we will be standing right here.
[2:54:05] Amen. Let me hit the tarmac. We can't we can't continue. I got to stop here,
[2:54:12] my friend. Let me hit the tarmac. I told uh uh uh the deacon,
[2:54:20] I'm trying to find how to word it up. Yes. In your fancy distinguished way.
[2:54:30] Are we together? Are we together? You know what happened on the hallway
[2:54:35] there? You know what happened on the way there? When you are on the line,
[2:54:44] when you waiting on the line for the next on the hallway there. Yeah. When the door
[2:54:50] of the bathroom is closed. and you waiting on the line to be the next one. It's painful.
[2:55:01] It's it's it's disturbing. And if your pro start to begin to do something, it is a problem. Amen.
[2:55:10] And it's painful because there was no building. Amen. But now that the building is coming up,
[2:55:21] even if you on the line, you say, "Don't worry, devil. It's just a matter of time.
[2:55:28] We will have no bathroom. It is no longer painful. We got the substance.
[2:55:38] Even if you waiting, there is a hope. I'm going to get there. It's a matter of time.
[2:55:45] I won't be waiting like that. That's how you put your faith in action. Tell the
[2:55:52] devil from today. You're going to hear a different music. You're going to hear a
[2:55:58] different confession. You're going to hear a different tongue. You're going to hear a son
[2:56:04] of God talking. When I wake up, I say, "I'm a son of God. I thank God for healing me.
[2:56:11] I serve a mighty God. You know what? I'm going to prepare for this. I'm going to prepare for
[2:56:17] that. Are we together? Are we together? Are we together? God want you to put it to work.
[2:56:30] When you put it to work, it moves God. When you put it to work, what you just did,
[2:56:38] you took God off. God say what happened? They jump in the fire. There's no way to
[2:56:45] stay here in heaven because somebody say if we die I will die believing but I won't bow.
[2:56:57] Are we together? Amen. You need a baby, put it to work. Amen. You need a house,
[2:57:02] put it to work. You need a husband, put it to work. You need a wife, put it to work.
[2:57:09] You need the Holy Ghost. Put it to work. Whatever you have need of,
[2:57:14] put it to work. Faith will give you everything. God bless you. Let's stand, my friend.
[2:57:31] Thank you Jesus. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you Lord Jesus. Thank you Lord Jesus. Are we together?
[2:57:44] Are we together? Director is erecting the building. We don't have his money yet. Amen. Did
[2:57:51] you see me arguing? Do you see me telling him I don't have your money yet? I'm just sitting there
[2:57:56] waiting. But I know before he finish there before his money will be there. Yes sir. Yes. Amen. Are
[2:58:06] we together? Amen. Are we together? Amen. Are we together? How many corner have you been?
[2:58:12] I mean push into it. Yes. You still there? Yes sir. Still standing. Amen. Church. This message
[2:58:20] is a living message. It is a message of stories. Amen. It's a message of life. A message that came
[2:58:29] to change your life in every aspect. Spiritually, materially, financially, physically, every aspect.
[2:58:46] Put it to work, my friend. Put it to work. You don't have the money? That's no problem. Go ask
[2:58:53] Go ask a question. Stop at the dealer. You say, "How much is this van?" Thank you. That's all I
[2:59:01] want to know. I want to know. Father, I want to start a business. That's the van I want.
[2:59:20] Are we together? Amen. Are we together? Money is faith. Amen. A woman brought
[2:59:30] $20. We will get to that. We will get to that. Lord's willing next Sunday. You'll
[2:59:36] see the $20 what he does. It was $20 for the building. But he flipped to a million.
[2:59:44] Sure did. And I'm going to shock you next week because he flipped to the Holy Ghost.
[2:59:56] Don't worry. It was money. It was money naturally. But he gave the Holy Ghost.
[3:00:06] We will get to that.
[3:00:11] Are we together with somebody who say nothing but the truth? That's all.
[3:00:27] Amen. That's it. I don't know which box you put yourself in. I don't know which
[3:00:35] condition you have accepted. And you are so depressed until your body pick up your
[3:00:42] depression. And your body when people look at your body, even the way you standing,
[3:00:47] you talking about depression. Just the way you are. It's just depression because it was so it's
[3:00:53] so much until it's manifested. When people see you, they see just depression. You don't have
[3:00:59] to tell nobody. When they look at you, they say that woman that is always down like this
[3:01:04] because it's it's so much in the spirit and the spirit affected the body. Let's pump new energy.
[3:01:14] Let's pump new energy. If you on the walker, walk with that walker with new energy. Yes.
[3:01:27] Heavenly Father, Lord, we are approaching you humbly this afternoon. Father, thanking you
[3:01:33] for your grace, for your love, for your mercy, and for everything you have been doing for us. Father,
[3:01:41] this is as far as you wanted me to go. Thank you, Lord. Lord, I plan for another, but Lord,
[3:01:47] Father, you knew that this is where we need to stop and you have a reason why. Lord,
[3:01:52] help this church. Help each individual here and online to put that faith into work. That
[3:02:02] faith that was once delivered to the saint. Let's put it to work. The faith was already
[3:02:09] restored by Malachi 4. The problem is not the faith is there. The faith is already there. The
[3:02:14] faith was delivered once. The faith was broken and restored back. The point is for us to take
[3:02:20] the faith and put it in the actions. You want to see a reaction from us that confirm to you
[3:02:27] that we are believing like Abraham. And father, this is what we will do. And we know that you
[3:02:33] keep your word because the problem in the covenant have never been your side. It has been our side.
[3:02:39] Father, help us through the Holy Spirit to put everything into the work so that Lord,
[3:02:44] Father, we can reap the benefit of what you die for in Calvary. Lord, protect each one of us.
[3:02:50] And whoever drove all the way here sick, Lord, remember them and don't let them because they
[3:02:56] came into the hospital. May they go back with a reassurance that everything is clear. Amen.
[3:03:02] And with a strength and a healing because you're still the same yesterday, today, and forever. We
[3:03:08] commit lord father the remaining of this year unto the hand. Father protect us and take the
[3:03:13] oncoming week unto the hand in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. God bless you church. We love you.
