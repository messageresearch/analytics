already not yet it's heavy few people already finished praise God so we got the 70 weeks of Daniel that day you can start on Amen the 70 weeks of Daniel are right here I cannot touch them because I don't want to get you lost if you were already there I would have used it and dealt with it and then we move forward but if I touch it right now will it's a teaching it just doesn't need one service we might need four or five service slowly until you reach there amen so you bear with me I see them dancing before me left and right and I can't handle they're like I'm here I'm like my church is not

be okay I already know this church I know how things go I know what's going on more than two-year pastors so I know which button to push then give amen our next house missing about our house meeting will be on October the 29th so it's always a Saturday remember that put that on your calendar and again it's going to be the young people handling it amen so the old mature folks are taking it easy all the young people will handle it amen I want you to work harder more than where we are you're already working so hard and I'm proud of you I see you over there playing the guitar I mean playing the the drums backing up I want you to be really really really involved what we usually call Young it's a waste of time when you think you're still young you already graduated from high school and you say I'm still young I still have a lot of time are you wasting your time you will realize that's the perfect time for you to do so many things and be established because right after high school Tom goes before you know it three years four years five years is gone we ask you what are you doing nothing what is in your bank account overdraft which major are you trying to do no you're still flipping from here from here from here so somewhere the GPS is lost amen so we want to refocus the GPS we route the GPS back again especially for the Young Folks so young adults talk to the Deacon schedule a meeting let's sit down and talk a little bit did I say anything wrong that's anything wrong you need to get to position quickly so we can handle some of the stuff if you hear what that did you hear what I said you are the one who's slowing the position did they hear me you didn't understand what I'm saying who didn't understand what I'm saying [Laughter] if you need the coach you see me that it's not to the woman to be seeking after the man you need that coach you see me so the sister don't goes looking for me don't worry I'll find the quote and put on WhatsApp chat so everybody found it then you're gonna say Amen on the WhatsApp chat everybody okay so it's up to the man that's gonna go ahead and do it but if the man is not in position you're the one wasting the time you need to get a good job you need to get the Holy Ghost [Music] man must have the Holy Ghost and they must have a good job where they can handle the bills without the system you make sure you handle your own bill before they bring you the hair bills and all the kind of bills so you make sure you handle your own bills so you get to position when you get to position most of the stuff will be handled quickly then you're gonna see Revelation popping up you're blind because you're not in your position that's why you don't see that's fine let's go to our scripture you heard what I say right you are 20 years old I'm still too young you're not Young 20 years old or I'm 18 years old I'm young you're not Young 21 in this country they tell you to drink beer we don't drink beer here you are driving you say you're too young hey get to position amen there is two ways to go you go the easy route or we put fire on you I will tell your parents I say okay they don't move put them in bills let them stop paying bills at home because they're buying too much Amazon they don't have anything to do with the money when money comes they keep buying online put them on the bills let them be responsible put them on the bills so those four checks they cut one out and the offering cut another one the other one I won't say he cut the other one then you then you're gonna learn amen I'm 20 years old oh I'm still young

know what to do I'm following the boss Daniel 2 32. this image head was a fine gold you might be seated your prayer has been answered before some of you lose GPS God I heard you you have to know how to manage money you have to know how to handle things no I just leave it alone we will talk when we see let me just leave it alone yeah let me just leave it alone if brother Branham say habits are Spirit [Music] you need a coat if you need the coat you raise your hand I'll put it in a chat brother Branham say habits are Spirit you know quench a spirit by a natural meaning you're wasting your time you hear me no God when they pay me one thousand dollars I will be fine they will increase your salary and you increase your expenses you say Lord now if I get five thousand dollars I will be living good they increase five thousand dollars you increase your expenses the problem is not the income the problem is the expenses one of this day you will remember me Daniel chapter 2 verse 32 this image that we know clearly was a fine gold it's breast and its arm the head is only one Amen in the body if you see somebody with two heads something is wrong we only have one head everybody okay but the arm we got two armed because the image was a human being you got two armor and you got two breasts so this head is one but the second Kingdom the second Kingdom have two arms two breasts and two arms amen so it's a kingdom that is double amen amen the barbicolonian is single but this one is double everybody okay you have two kingdoms that are connected or joint join together everybody okay that's why the code let me just help you up that's why they call this the middle Persian everybody okay we you got the middies and ugada Persia amen the midi and the Persia are hooked together they form one Kingdom because you have a right arm and you got a left arm but both of them are made they are both under the silver everybody okay if I rob you they'll the way you usually don't like I'm so happy this image was a fine gold it's breast and its arm of silver and it's barely and it's sad and its ties of water grass so after silver follow the brass which has the belly and the tie everybody okay let's go to Daniel 7 verse 4. you need your Bible and those who read Daniel 8 Daniel 9 is going to be easier on you those who didn't read you have to stay focused and I will encourage you to go home and to read it there is nothing in the Bible that is written just by any chance I believe you already learned in this church the Tabernacle was like a mystery now you can walk in the Tabernacle and you begin to see this this this and everything is clear so there is nothing that is hidden in the scripture because the seal is already broken amen Daniel chapter 7 verse 4. if you dare you can say Amen the first Beast was like a lion and had the ego wings I beheld till the wings thereof were plucked we understand that language now and it was lift up from the earth we understand that language and made stand upon the feet as a man and a man's heart was given to him amen so this beasts become a human being become incarnated into a human being but what I want you to keep in that the first Beast is a combination of a lion and an eagle amen this is the kingdom of Babylon amen so Babylon you will see a lion and you must see an ego everybody okay when you see Babylon it's a lion but you must see an eagle and the ego is the one that keep everything under control when you take the eagle off then the lion will not be a beast anymore it will become a human being everybody okay glory to God verse 5 and behold another Beast a second like a water yeah the second beast is a bear Hallelujah glory to God the second beast is like a bear and he raised up itself on one side everybody care so this bear have two sides everybody okay scripture don't play brother Branham says now let this be known scripture doesn't play with words whatever is in the record it's there for the anointed as to what see it is there for a purpose everybody okay so far we okay so despair when it's raising it's raising on one side so the bear have two sides but he's using one side to rest so this bear have two sides but he's using one side amen so the power of this bed is more lean toward one side everybody okay so one sad is a Little Bit Stronger compared to the other side you follow me glory to God it's a different language so it's a military airplane to stay put on Amen and he had two eatings in the mouth and in the mouth of it between the teeth of it and they say that's to it erased devour much water so it's a beast that can kill really pretty bad amen and the mouth contained three ribs three and a rib three ribs one two three ribs so that it's a letter three with a rib we also know where the ribs means you know in Genesis right you know what they did to Adam right they pull the reef right okay let's go to verse six and after this I beheld and low another like a leopard the third one is a leopard glory to God another like a leopard this should be like a review which head upon its back upon the back of it how many wings four wings this leopard got four wings but four wings of a farm it is not an eagle everybody okay it has nothing to do with an ego it is just a bird the eagle is a bird this one is a file it's also a bird but it's not an eagle amen but the number is four everybody okay which head upon its back of it four wings of a fowl the Beast head also foreheads amen so this Beast has four wings and four hands in other words within this Beast amen everybody okay this beast when he's moving on he carried four things we okay this beast in his belly in his power amen he carry four powers joined together everybody here it's four heads and four wings so those four heads of a leopard are joined together it's like a kingdom that have four kingdoms everybody okay but those four kingdoms are joined together into one Beast we okay now glory to God you say the beasts also had four heads and Dominion was given to it so if we come back here the lion is just one with an ego the bear is working with two sad one of the sad is most stronger but the leopard have four Kingdom that are drawn together into one Kingdom everybody okay and we know the bear is the middle pigeon and we already seen that the middle Vision have two arm and two breasts we okay now but this one have number four everybody good let's go to Revelation chapter 17. then we will pray glory to God I know these books are kiwi people don't want to read them they run away from them they don't want to preach about it you hardly hear it but the very good good books the most complicated book that you find in the Bible got a lot of stuff that will explain you what's going on that's why we need a prophet Revelation chapter 17 verse 12. if you dare you can say Amen we read this last Sunday and the ten horns which you sow are Ten Kings which have no Kingdom as yet but receive power as king one hour with the Beast so there is a covenant with the Beast you remember last Sunday these have one mind they believe in one thing communism you remember that Sunday and shall give the power and strength to the Beast so they're going to be deceived somehow and join to the Beast thinking they're doing something good amen but the Shadi shall make war with the lamb amen glory to God these ten kingdoms or these Ten Kings which we saw last Sunday that it was 10 dictators you remember amen which symbolizing the power of communism amen this power hit God we okay he hates the land amen he hits the lamp these shall make war with the lamb so there is an enmity between this group against the land and the lamb shall overcome them Armageddon is right here amen for he is Lord of lords and King of Kings if you remember when they say king of King it's throwing you to Revelation 19 when he's coming on the White Horse you remember in other words that's how the scripture is telling you go back to Revelation 19. amen for his Lord of Lord and king of King and they that are with him so the lamb doesn't come himself everybody okay remember in Revelation 19 when he's coming there is an army following him and that Army was in fine learning which was the bride following him so the lamb comes with his brother and here the Bible says that the lamb and and the lamb and they that are with him because the bride is not one person it's a many members body that makes one bread of Jesus Christ amen so this Kingdom these power doesn't like you he doesn't like the lamb and the Bride of the Lamb amen that's why he makes war with the land and the bride because the husband and the wife are we okay glory to God he said and the lamb shall overcome them for he is Lord of lords and king of kings and they that are with him amen our call they are there that are with him are called we are called first amen now that we call the only Karma but we are also Chosen and not only are we chosen by we are water faithful everybody okay so the bride is faithful in whatever the brother does she's faithful she's faithful living in church she's faithful in reading her Bible everybody okay she's called she's Chosen and she is faithful and the lamb himself is the faithful and the true Witness you don't know that the Bible said that Jesus Christ is the faithful and the true witness we are faithful because he is also faithful in other words we become him everybody okay so the bride and the lamb are one everybody okay you can no more Jesus Christ can no more be separated everybody okay where he goes we go with him even in war we go to war with him because usually the bride stay in the palace and the King goes well but this is a different story now buff the bride and the King are going towards everybody care everybody care because the woman was defeated in the Garden of Eden now the woman need to Revenge and defeat the serpent the serpent defeated you in Eden now in the end time we must defeat the serpent [Applause] everybody okay in other words the husbands stand there and say get him beat him up beat him up everybody okay everybody okay Jesus stand back and say go ahead beat him up amen and the serpent is afraid because the husband is there and you are there you say you devil you remember what you did to me and he cannot say anything because the master is right there [Applause] when the bride will recognize who she is she will be a water when Jesus is coming with her nor me behind it's an invisible Army in other words the devil will never defeat you anymore glory to God to verse 15. and he said to me the waters which you saw where the horse sits are people and multitude and Nation and tongue remember the war the is sitting on the Beast and the Beast is sitting on water amen so if you see a woman on the water automatically you know where it's it's pulling you it's in Revelation 17 you're dealing with Jezebel amen I'm saying this because you're going to see it in the Old Testament just the way it's written amen verse 16 and they turn on the ten horns which you saw upon the Beast these shall hurt the whole so something will happen that will create enmity within the big system everybody okay and there will be a separation amen and that separation will cause the ten horn to turn around and come to revenge on the Beast amen and this shall hurt the whole and shall make her desolate and naked amen and shall eat her flesh and burn her with water fire so the will be burned with fire amen this church will be completely destroyed by fire who's going to do that the Ten Kings amen which is nothing but what everybody okay job to Revelation 18 verse 8 and 9 then we pray glory to God hallelujah verse 8 therefore shall help lag it's a woman come in one day so they're going to destroy her in one day amen death mourning and famine and she shall be orderly burned with water so something is going to burn on this world in this world in one day something is going to happen boom and burn everything amen for strong is the Lord God who judge it you know they judge her because of the blood she's drunk with blood and the kings of the earth who have committed fornication and live deliciously with her shall be well here so somebody will begin to Moon after her and lament for her when they shall see the water of her water they're not gonna see her anymore they will just see the smoke of her burden so somebody will be completely destroyed everybody okay let's pray Heavenly Father Lord once again we are approaching you humbly this morning Father thanking you for your grace for your love your mercy father and for everything you have been doing for us Lord we thank you for your protection against Lord this hurricane that was heading toward North Carolina father you protected us you protected our home father the impact that was predicted didn't even happen because of the prayer of your Saint Lord and father we can once again testify that the Judgment of this world is held because of the presence of the bread and father today on Sunday morning you gave us a beautiful day with the sun shining and gave us also the desire and opportunity to come into your house to Fellowship together Lord with scent of like Precious Faith around the revealed word of the hour Lord may you forgive us for everything we grieve the Holy Spirit may you move every demonic Spirit of resentment every spirit that will trouble the people or distract them and father may only the Holy Spirit and the elect Angel be in this place to anoint to bless to touch to feel to transform the life of your children and to Lord father Enlighten them by the power of the of the Revelation father we rebuke everything that is contrary to your word may you protect our homes and our properties and this church property and speak to our soul in a powerful way father in the name of Jesus Christ amen God God richly bless you my subject this morning is the four phases of Ruth the Dual fold of the silver empress the Dual fold of the silver and Brass in other words the silver have two aspects and this brass have two aspects what are they brother Stephen we are still in the threshing floor dealing with the second oil Lord help me reach there and down down down in the Tabernacle we are in the holiest amen because whatever is happening now it is connected with the coming of the Lord and to meet the Lord you must have oil in your lamp amen so the baptism of the holy spirit is connected with the fact that it makes you a candidate to meet the Lord into the air I'm going to remind you this because it's very important we will need it later on brother Branham say a prophecy sometimes has a natural meaning then he has a spiritual meaning in other words the prophecy all are all are the prophecy ever compound meeting amen so when you read Prophecy in the scripture you must be very careful amen you can catch it spiritually but you can lose it naturally or you can catch it naturally and you lose it spiritually and if you lose it spiritually something is happening in other words when a prophecy gets fulfilled you must watch what is going on naturally speaking with that prophecy and what is behind the prophecy that we cannot see with our own eyes in other words a prophecy have an unseen fulfillment and a fulfillment that is visible the visible is what you can see but the deadly one is what you cannot see which is the invisible and we walk by faith [Music] and not by water tight so whatever happened in the world you must be able to climb higher like an eagle and see what is behind it everybody okay brother Branham say any Bible reader knows that all scripture has a compound meaning every prophecy not some some most all of it has a water a time there and two times or more that it shall be water answered or fulfilled as a revolving water of history in other words when you read the Old Testament do you follow me you must see a prophecy that was prophesied anybody here and that prophecy happened in the Old Testament everybody okay but if you get caught right there you're gonna miss it the prophecy happened in the Old Testament for a reference everybody okay his brother Prana may love today have the Rapture ever happen God knew brother Branham would die before the rapture everybody okay the way brother Branham was preaching he also purple everybody okay that he would stay alive until Jesus comes everybody care if brother brother meets alive whatever prophecy happen brother Branham will stand and say you see what is happening there this is right here in the Bible you see what is happening there it is right here in the Bible but God knew that brother Branham won't be there everybody here because brother Branham die with 56 years amen right which is seven times eight am I saying something Amen brother Branham say every seven years something happened to your life everybody okay brother Branham went through seven seven and when he reached eternity seven eight God took him you're going to swallow that later everybody okay everybody okay everybody okay so when God knew that brother Branham would die before the Rapture happened amen God allow prophecy to be fulfilled when brother brother meets alive everybody okay but he was not the Rapture yet are you following me so the reason why it happened is for brother Branham to give you a Baseline to give you a reference since America started no Catholic President everybody come if not Catholic President was was risen when brother Branham was alive you could be lost today because all you see world will be another president in the power but God knew that brother Branham would die and God said no no no no I need to give these children something because prophecy repeated itself everybody okay while brother Branham is alive God open up Kennedy do you follow me so when Kennedy is coming up brother Branham sees the prophecy he look he said oh the Rapture is going to happen everybody okay then brother Branham Trace Kennedy into the scripture and said this is the first Catholic Church everybody okay and for some reason something left the lips of Radha Branham and say for sure we will have another one hey everybody okay brother Branham continue and die in 65 we never have another Catholic President everybody okay but the prophecy remain true everybody okay now brother Branham is not here brother Branham is dead brother Branham is in the sixth Dimension now another president happened again which is a Catholic President everybody here when that happened because of what already happened everybody okay now we can go back in the reading of the prophet and we can read it and come back and begin to understand what is happening today because prophecy sometimes repeats itself and you can miss the repetition while it's giving you a signal of what God is trying to do so sometimes when you read the Old Testament you must see Isaiah prophesying something and it happened in the time of Isaiah amen but if you look at the description of the prophecy the prophecy will sometimes say this prophecy is for the latter days but Isaiah was not delayed the days it is telling you that that prophecy will repeat again the second time foreign are we okay did I lose anybody glory to God where are you going brother Stephen last Sunday we took the Beast of revelation 13. we combined that Beast together with the church changes everybody okay we started first in heaven and you need this today because I could not get to this on Sunday last Sunday the Bible says that in heaven there was a great dragon having seven horns and ten horns you understand this now verse 4 this is where I want you to remember that the tale of this Dragon drew the third part of the stars of Heaven so the Dragon did something to the Stars not all the star but only a third everybody okay a third of the stars of heaven and did cast them to water Earth he cast them to the Earth or to the ground or to the Dust amen so if you see a power I know what I'm saying that is dealing with the star and taking the star and put them down onto the Earth what power is that you follow me the name might change remember that the form can change but you watch the working of the spirit watch the characteristic of that Beast he will tell you who is behind everybody here so we don't get caught up with the name we get caught with the Fulfillment of what that thing is doing if whatever happened you can call this even let me call it maybe a parrot everybody okay if I see a parrot taking the stars and putting them on the ground it is not a parrot [Music] everybody okay it is the dragon in the parrot do you follow me do you follow me so whatever will repeat something like this it tells you who it is because Jesus Christ himself is the same today and water forever if you have the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost will not do something new you know anybody here they will continue to live the same life that the holy ghost live that's how we can tell you God the Holy Ghost you got the Holy Ghost because we are doing the same thing we have the same anointing we have the same spirit that spirit will make you behave a certain way that is in reference to the life of Jesus Christ you cannot have a holy ghost that make you behave different than Jesus Christ that is not the Holy Ghost however everybody okay your Holy Ghost must make you do the work of Christ everybody care when we see the work of Christ then we can tell which spirit is working on you when you see the work of a dragon then you can tell who is behind whatever name that you're dealing with everybody okay and the Bible said that the Great Dragon was cast out that old water called the devil and who Satan we understand this now now the way we connected this we found that in pergamos I'm just reviewing so I take off in pilgrims we got the certain seat and the dragon gave to this Beast here the seat of himself so the seat and the seat matches together amen and the first seal that started in Ephesus was crying already everybody okay and he was crying into a man called the first prophet which was the pope you remember that then the next age was that Italian churches then a woman came back there by the name of Jezebel which called herself a prophetess now we have a prophet plus a prophetess we have a prophet amen plus a prophetess amen this Prophet received the Dragon which is the old serpent amen plus a woman which is Jezebel amen the combination of these two join us to revelation 17. where we saw now the woman that is sitting upon us and that Beast have seven horns and ten seven heads and ten horn everybody okay so when that Beast and the woman join together in Revelation 17 if he opened up the seven uh the second seal when the second seal was open the woman begin to kill we saw it last Sunday she killed so much until she was drunk with the blood of descent amen and because of her killing the church fled from Europe amen because a new land was discovered America the main flower made a day and then in the edge of Philadelphia the independence of United States happened then America rose again as a beautiful power that loves God and everything but according to prophecy this power will speak like a dragon everybody okay but the dragon was the devil who was Satan who was the old Serpent and that Dragon already incarnated into Rome by now we found out that the dragon is also in America how did the dragon get to America how did this dragon how did Satan get to Adam Satan got to Adam first by getting into the serpent everybody okay Dead from the serpent to the woman everybody care then the woman came and began to teach fornication to Adam everybody okay how did the Beast get to America the beast from Heaven the dragon who is Satan amen got him to the Beast everybody okay the beasts of Rome everybody okay and the beasts are from use a Woman by the name of Jezebel amen and Jezebel got into America everybody okay from Satan in heaven into the serpent from the serpent into the woman from the woman into Adam and teach Adam to commit fornication everybody okay from the dragon into the beast from the Beast into the woman the two combined together and the woman into the America which brother Branham said I see the Catholic Church I see the Catholic Church which is a woman everybody okay so far did I lose anybody glory to God now we can see now there is a connection between the two here and when that connection happened God's soul that he will avenge the blood of his scent he will come and burn but the whole is not only in Rome by prophecy made it to the United States because we found out in United States that there was a woman wearing purple and this woman also was wearing purple you know that or you don't know it who doesn't know it okay glory to God this woman also was wearing paper and then it was combined with the second Catholic President confirming to us in the spiritual background that the woman amen the Catholic church is now in the United States everybody okay so if God wants to burn everybody okay the woman he cannot Burn only Rome everybody okay because the woman is buff in Rome and also in United States amen because according to the judgmentary the Bible says and this woman if you remember the Bible call her mystery Babylon mystery Babylon amen Babylon the water the great in other words Babylon even though naturally was destroyed Babylon is still under existence now in Jeremiah the Bible said I will Render unto Babylon and to all in our inhabitants of Calvin all the evil that they have done in Zion if you look in the time of Jeremiah Jeremiah was in the time of captivity everybody okay and it looks like Jeremiah was talking about the Revenge of God in Babylon at that time everybody okay which path really happened God destroyed Babylon but we found out that the burning of Babylon that Jeremiah said here is also spoken in the Book of Revelation because prophecy has a compound meaning prophecy repeated itself everybody okay everybody okay because what because Babylon of the Old Testament was the natural part but what was on the Babylon was a spirit you can destroy the vessel but the spirit of Babylon is there so we got a chance that Spirit until God destroys it everybody okay so far the Bible says this in the book uh in in the mark of the beast body Brahm say this he said you are coming into the power of communism make her desolated naked and shall eat her flesh and burn her with water why because God put in the heart the heart of the people that hate him everybody okay God put in the heart to fulfill his will and to agree and to give their Kingdom unto the water peace until the words of God be what fulfilled so the destruction of the Beast is coming by communism will be all right buddy but if Adam says that these 10 horses are horns these tenth Kingdom what are they he said they are dictator watch the way dictator leads to where is he leaning to just tell me a dictator that doesn't lean toward water communism that is dictator you see of course these have water now look here and they talk about water communism brother Brown I'm clearly defined to us that the destruction of the woman is coming with Communism she will head the woman and burn her amen because the woman is the agent Satan is using to make everybody in the world drank with the wine of her fornication the entire world everybody okay amen everybody okay the serpent doesn't have to work anymore the serpent work on Eve and left Eve hey everybody okay he was Eve who was responsible to continue the destruction everybody care so when the first prophet combined with the woman amen and the woman is polluted everybody okay the first prophet stayed quiet in Rome and the woman the churches they opened the churches everywhere amen and the Catholic Church being everywhere in the world that is the church that is polluting everywhere it's going but the Beast itself might not be in your country he doesn't have to be in your country the woman does the dirty job for him foreign so God Must Destroy the woman and to destroy the woman he's using the power of Communism in order to burn that woman everybody okay everybody okay so if we are dealing with Babylon as a woman amen Babylon mystery Babylon the great which is a what a woman amen if this woman is Babylon god brother Branham say before he uses something you follow me God doesn't use weapon just like that everybody okay God looks through times because his knowledge make him omnipresent we went through that when we say that God is omnipresent it doesn't mean God is everywhere like the air we already explained you that it is the knowledge of God that makes God omnipresent and that knowledge give even God the power to be prophetic because God knows everything since he knows everything he can prophesy he's prophesying because he already know everything he knows you're dead a breath all the way till you die if he knows everything God can come and say in 2014 this and this will happen to you and it's going to happen the reason why God can prophesy is because God knows already everything amen the prophecy is a chunk of his knowledge do you follow me that he brings it out and tell you before it happened but he already knows that everybody okay so far anyway okay so far so God when he sees everything he already know everything so before he uses a weapon do you follow me amen God must make sure that that weapon will remain true in eternity everybody okay that's why brother Branham say if you approach God and you ask God for something and God gave it to you that's hey it means everybody that will approach God under the same ground that you did must receive the same result all the time that's what made Jesus Christ the same today and what because if we already started something he will continue all the time with it everybody okay so to destroy the kingdom of Babylon when Daniel was rejected you remember God used the bear everybody okay to destroy Babylon God used the power of the bear everybody care when God searched the Beast he looked at the leopard he said the leopard cannot match Babylon you look at this one he said not this one he pick up the bear amen and he said the bear you're gonna destroy Babylon once God destroyed Babylon with the bear everybody okay everybody okay it is sealed eternally are we okay if God wanted to destroy Babylon again he doesn't have to think twice everybody okay he just go back again and use the same weapon he uses again amen and Destroy Babylon they bear on that time might be a little bit different in form and name and aspect by the spirit will remain the same everybody okay so far everybody okay so far glory to God so the bear today we find that there is a country today hey everybody here that country is called Russia everybody okay NDM blame of this country the animal power of this country Isabel amen why is this country calling itself the bear everybody care everybody care if you look naturally the middle pigeon are on the side of Aaron everybody here so if you chase the belt there you're not gonna get them you follow me the bear is not there today he was the bear on that time but because prophecy repeat itself everybody okay everybody okay that spirit will move into somebody and begin to attack Babylon and Destroy Babylon again today everybody okay so far now as we're leading with the bear follow me carefully now put your seat belt the Bear in Daniel 2 was simple as as The Silver Kingdom everybody okay because Daniel was the kingdom and then Daniel 7 Daniel 2 was the kingdom and then your seven was the power behind the kingdom anybody okay in danger too when you look at the one who destroyed Babylon it was the middle pigeon follow me carefully anybody okay the middle pigeon that was the kingdom but behind it was a bear everybody okay and let me remind you that all these beasts here are not domestic animals brother Branham says this revelation 11. Revelation 13 Revelation 17 they were beasts there were beasties the chapters in Revelation 11 13 and 17 is called water the same way but the Beast there interpretation is fairion very on the word Greek period which means water and water until Beast can I raise some of them the twofold they do or fold of the bear of the silver and the brass amen the silver is the middle Persian Kingdom anybody okay the power behind that kingdom is a bear but we found out that all the power are wild amen they are Savage amen they are Untamed amen to get them into the zoo you will struggle you have to eat them shoot them put them to sleep and put them up and put them in the zoo because if we wake up before you get to the zoo you are done everybody okay everybody okay brother Branham said they are wild they are 10 they are Savage they're supposed to be living in the bush of forest in the world area over there terion means what the world and term beast but the beasts of the four living room um I mean uh I mean uh four living creature those are called the Zune by the Branham said terion is a word and term Savage everybody okay so if the middle pigeon their animal was a bear amen so this power also is world I'm going slowly it is a Savage power [Music] and it is a power that you can attain that's the power that they use to handle Babylon everybody okay where are you going as we're dealing with despair you okay now despair according to Daniel 7 and Daniel 2 he speak about the kingdom of the middle Persian Empire and this is the kingdom God used to destroy Babylon everybody okay but today the bear is represented by the country of Russia everybody okay why brother Stephen have we have to deal with this Kingdom and Russia Today what is going on between the bear and Russia brother Branham say Spirit doesn't die we okay man die but Spirit does not die God take his man but never his Spirit God took Elijah and the double portion of his Spirit Came Upon Elisha about a hundred years later came out on John the Baptist and predicted to come when once again again where in the last day God took Christ out of the Earth but the Holy Spirit Come Back the devil take his man everybody okay but the spirit remains just the water so if the spirit were satanic spirit and this Spirit operated in the Kingdom of middles and Persian even though those Kingdom were destroyed the spirit was still available let's go to Isaiah 13. then I'm good in time for those who worry Isaiah 13 verse 1. you make sure you have a Bible because you need it why are we studying the spirit what is important about the spirit amen amen the form can change the name match and you remember that quote by the working of the spirit will remain the same if you chase the middle prison by Aaron Iran is causing trouble too but not at the level of the other bear and I ran if you chase the animal it's not a bear the national animal is everybody okay but we found the country for some reason they look at the continent they say we have a grizzly bear here we have a primary in Asia we call ourselves the bear I haven't you can chase the woman in Europe you will find her she's also in America if you stuck in Rome you will miss her in America if you stuck in Iran you can miss the Bear in Russia everybody okay Isaiah 13. let's go now first one remember prophecy does what revolve the burden of who which Isaiah the son of Amos did see Isaiah God bring a message for Babylon amen what Isaiah Isaiah what are you talking about Babylon we need to know what is going on with Babylon what is God saying job to verse 9. behold the day of the Lord come how oh does this look like the time of Isaiah does it look like the time of Isaiah you gotta know how prophecy work beyond the day come the day is gonna be cruel buff with rough and feast and anger Jesus Christ was God and Jesus was God who came down from heaven when Jesus came did you see him cool no did you see the day of Jesus being cruel and then feel Sanger matter of fact Jesus brought Mercy he brought Grace but this coming of the Lord is not with Mercy everybody okay this the coming of the Lord of Jesus Christ according to Isaiah was a virgin shall prophesy that's what fulfilled but this one when the Lord cometh the Lord is not happy the Lord is not laughing the Lord is angry by the anger of the Lord is in the last day why is he angry somebody is drunk with the blood of his sentence we understand now follow me carefully if you can restrict the movement that would be great behold the day of the Lord come crew buff with wrath and fierce anger to lay the land desolate and he shall destroy the water stop when Jesus Christ came he did he destroy the sinner Jesus came to do what to serve the sinner but this is no more saving Grace is over so you got to know how you're looking at prophecy everybody okay to destroy the Sinners amen there thereof out of it verse 10 for the water doors the stars of Heaven and the constellation thereof shall not give the water light what is he talking about tribulation because in the sixth Hill when they open the whole Earth the Sun and the Moon everything was darkened this is not the time of Isaiah you understand now you need to know how prophecy revolve the day the Bible says the light the stars of Heaven verse 10 and the constellation thereof shall not give the light the sun shall be what darkened dark and in its going forth and the moon shall not cause her light to shine everybody okay verse 11 and I will punish the water world for the water evil did Jesus punish the world he came and shed his blood to save the world everybody okay but this time he's punishing the world I will punish the world everybody okay with evil uh for their evil and the wicked for their iniquity and I will cause the arrogancy of the pride to seize I will lay low the haughtiness of the water everybody okay drop to verse 15. now we understand which burden I say ahead in other words Isaiah had the burden for Babylon but not the Babylon of his time because at the end time there is Mystery Babylon so Isaiah begin to prophesy about the Babylon of the end time we okay now jump to verse 15. everyone that is found shall be trust through in other words if they found you connected with this Babylon they will kill you amen everyone that is joined you see the word join to them shall fall by the sword everybody okay their children also shall be dashed to pieces so whoever is destroying this Babylon when he see children he will get the children and dash them to pieces the one destroying but follow me carefully I know what I'm dealing with the one destroying Babylon who Dash children that's children in pieces amen in pieces we on verse uh 16 before the eyes their house shall be watered and their wife water Babylon when he entered Babylon if he sees a child take the child Dash to pieces if he's seeing a woman that is married he raped her let's go slowly spoil hand spoiler what houses and he does water ravish women why do you go through those detail brother Stephen because I'm not caught up with the name I need to look at the manifestation of the spirit that destroy Babylon and I need to look today who does this kind of stuff we okay now we okay now let's go to verse 16 verse 7 uh verse 17. behold everybody okay watch carefully with me my brother you there behold I will stir up the water can you say it loud which Kingdom God is using to do this he's using the water the meat was which power so amid are you following me power is a power that rafish women [Music] I'm going slowly it's a power that's foreign houses and that that's children to pieces you will understand where I'm going everybody okay behold I will stir up the middies against them which shall not regard water silver and as for water gold they shall not Delight in water you cannot grab them it's a it's a kingdom it's a nation that you don't bribe them when they come for Destruction you cannot seek peace with them and say let's seek a treaty of peace they don't get it it's a nation that you cannot brother everybody okay where are you going pastor job to verse uh uh uh 18. damn boy shall also water yes that's what young man to pieces can you go quick I don't hear you greatly yeah stop the scriptures say Debo follow me carefully when they shoot a young man you follow me when they go reach the young men what does he do today young men it destroyed to peace stop show me a ball in this world I hope you are following me you follow me show me a bow in this world that if you put a young man and you shoot the young man when that boy hit the young man he busts the young men in pieces have you seen a ball like that what is the prophet looking at what is the prophet looking at I'm going 25 miles an hour so you learned how to read your scripture what is the prophet looking at what vocabulary does he have does a prophet know the shotgun the prophet saw somebody with something like this do you follow me and when the person Shook and then whatever he should touch the young man and he burst their many pieces when the prophet look he said I see them with a ball that was the vocabulary of his time about those ball when they shoot the young man he bursts the young men to Pieces the old bow was only piercing people but these four that's the young men to Pieces why was the prophet looking at a water spoken word where were the prophet looking at do you see how the scripture that's why you need the prophet everybody okay now let me ask you a question does this prophecy belong to the Old Testament he belongs to which timer does he belong to the time of power does he belong to the time of outrageous does he belong to the time of Luther does he belong to the town of Columbus does he belong to the time of Wesley why are the shotgun that you shoot somebody and the best the person to be seasoned we okay now at the opening of The Seven Seals the Bible became Anew so they are using weapon of mass destruction amen you think the prophet was looking at both shooting the people and the bust Verse 18 they Dash their men to Pieces they shall have no pity on the fruit of the womb the eyes shall not spare water children I'm saying this so you understand what is coming up you who are playing Church you who don't want to come to church be careful because somebody will come when he sees your child
