into th holy hands we have read the scripture here we need it to be expounded to us to our hearts to our souls so each and everyone when we going back home today we should say was it not our hearts were burning when he was speaking to us we need it Lord these scriptures are very deep we need somebody to show us what they are thank you father that you have kept him until today that we should be together on this side of river Jordan may all honor glory and Majesty be unto thee take you control of everything now in Jesus CH name we pray amen amen amen you may be seated God bless you oh God bless you amen amen um actually I was looking at a certain scripture but I have put it aside for to have something which won't take a long time Abraham abam madc in the house of Abraham Abraham amen now brother Bram brother I was reading where he said we have Abraham and who else Abraham and Bram amen all right that's how he puts it Abraham and so this H I think many of you have read that part more all right amen so not going to talk take a long time I'm glad to be in the house of Abraham I'm not talking about the building I'm talking about the house of Abraham Abraham [Music] amen uh there's brother uh with whom we are watching the events and uh many of the people that I have heard talking they tell me that they can't see beyond 202 [Music] some of this things they appear on television but we in the house of Abraham we know about these things there's one sign I thank God for sending Elijah [Music] Prophet every sign I look at then I turn to this h of our day that he has spoken and here it is okay now brother BR in one of the uh of his writings he says what you need is to meet this male kiss then I said oh it's possible to meet we thought that the Bible was talking about somebody we couldn't meet now this part here the pro my Prophet says and this madc became flesh he started by saying in one of the pages that he was [Music] no or a prophet sorry or he came as a prophet a prophet comes after amen amen but here now H I'm looking at this this meis became flesh oh be now we have always read about him as an invisible until I arrive where brother says became flesh when he come as a prophet is then I Rejoice that day that this m MC became flesh am meaning he became somebody I could shake hands [Applause] with all right now let's read but then where is the Seed of Abraham where is their sign I quot that he said as it was in the days of Sodom that God came down and was manifested in human flesh then I started to turn around just as it was in those days amen amen so God bless you now there's a book here Hebrews the one that says what you need is to meet all right amen let's look at it for a few minutes it will take us somewhere else uh he became flesh he revealed himself as son of [Music] man when he come as a prophet I don't believe it is confusing amen all right when he was in the house of Abraham it was a man he doesn't say a the in the house of abrah because they could share a plate of food with him in the house of Abraham amen now sometimes what brings the tears down your eyes what brings your [Music] tears to flow down that's when you believe and you are able to say one day I will meet [Applause] this but I will say to you that you have already met him but you [Applause] amen amen okay let me read brother Brenham speaks about the ministry that started Beyond Time and shall be finished Beyond Time okay amen uh do you know somebody else beside your Prophet oh you don't know okay all right I will read here's the the book of Hebrews you know brother some of the things amen I thought I was reading who is this MC when actually I was reading the book of Hebrews amen amen amen amen okay amen let me have this one I've got many things here I believe you will beay with me amen you know I was reading and uh reading this book and that book okay amen now here it says this is who is this mil page 30 but I don't know which she is but uh but then where is that Royal Seed of Abraham you know as the Sons and Daughters of God there is something in our heart we sometimes ask ourselves because there's something in our but then where is that Royal Seed of Abraham I quot where is their sign that he said as it was in those days so shall it be now this uh Seed of Abraham has a sign okay amen as we have met like this today I was longing to meet you amen amen when I was told about the coming pastors and I was so glad that I will come to meet them now I will finish just now now brother Bram says brother my Prophet are you ready to meet him MEC he says that's what you need are you ready to meet M amen but but then I know that I don't need to try to prepare this and that to meet him I only need to be of the seed amen [Applause] amen all the people that are the Seed of Abraham actually they don't know that they have met [Applause] already in this form where brother bam says he came all right amen we are going to meet M amen amen amen but by the time we meet him we would sing some songs for meeting the Lord Jesus [Applause] Christ uh then let me read to you are you ready to meet him amen you will see that brother did meet but then in which form as maybe you can get confused confused I'm not confused as my Prophet told me what you need is to [Music] meet he didn't say in heaven because he says MC became [Applause] flesh and that then I knew that I also heard amen he comes in different names Jehovah Jehovah amen amen he comes in many names but yet it's still the same one do you love me but I read this part it is from this book of Hebrews why blessed that is I think page 300 3 he says are you ready to meet him then he say why blessed be the name of the Lord listen something on the inside of me met [Music] that something do you know you have somebody in you [Applause] I received this from Brother B saying in this book of question and answers where he says do you know that there is somebody in you amen amen I was reading alone and I said yes my [Applause] Prophet I know because there's somebody in you amen amen if you are a child of God even now you can feel [Applause] him because he is in you amen I thank God for malach amen then he says are you ready to meet him I repeat he says why blessed be the name of the Lord something in the inside of me met meis [Applause] that's brother BR brother brother Bram brother Bram he he came sent from God not only sent by God but sent [Applause] from you know you can regard yourself as a son or daughter from from God that's why you cannot sin [Applause] against God that doesn't mean you are holding yourself no you are God's seed amen he that is you in you is greater than the one that is in the world all right amen before we close he says something I I hope you are listening something on the inside of me met that I don't know I don't think you are confused confused I I I believe you understand who is this something because in the same books here tells you that he was no he was a theop amen amen amen yes he was a theop now what is that in you what do you call it aop amen don't you thank God that he gave you a [Applause] standard praise God this the it will remain in you be because it's for you to be a able to make a [Applause] conduct you can't even sin because there is somebody in you brother bam speaks about you he says did you know that there is somebody in you how many have somebody amen okay that's why we used to sing into my heart into my heart into my [Applause] heart you know when he is in you you are not even trying to live a holy [Applause] life because you are not yourself he has changed you amen amen let's say before we close here now he say some on the inside of that's brother he say something on the inside of me met that what is this something something on the already you know who is that he is referring to somebody in the inside now this what he says here something in me met that mil MC can't just be somebody a visit or something else he is king of Sal am king of [Applause] Sal let me count to the hands how many are going to meet the king now brother says in one of his preachings he says he is now a king I will bring the quotation Abraham Abraham before he could arrive at the new city he met the king [Music] first before you can arrive there you need to meet the king did you know that king of Jerusalem Jem uh but I want you to take this with you let me repeat it why blessed be the name of the Lord something on the inside of met okay amen when did he come as a prophet because he says this m came as a prophet all right amen who is that [Applause] Prophet right amen now as I'm asking this question you are looking at at a man of Flesh and Blood and you are asking yourself question could this be the man yeah it's him talking like that but me also as a son I know that that is the truth something inside of him what is that thing it's his own words that's why we have received him [Applause] when he came as a [Applause] prophet have you received [Applause] mday it can be somebody else but Jesus H we have received him are you listening when he came as a prophet now while you are trying to H to see meis as a [Music] man you are trying to take him a photo the prophet says something inside [Applause] inside you can't get a photo after of the out of that M amen you also uh maybe you understand what it means to say I am a Christian it's not talking about a person who reads his Bible it's talking about a person who has somebody inside the real Christian is somebody with somebody inside you read these things you understand that's the real Christian you are not a Christian because you read the Bible you are a Christian there's somebody in you and he said greater is he that is in [Applause] you that is in the world amen amen we are not trying to avoid sinning no we are just [Music] [Applause] and the Bible says you can't s which is impossible for you as a child of because there's that [Applause] nature before I finalize that's why actually my my title I've got it from Brother the final it says the final end of the attributes say they will do exactly like Abraham they bear the side all right amen the final end of he said it will happen again to the final end of the attributes amen M amen now before I close here now he says that that's my Prophet Hebrews 309 309 what you need Church you need something but what it is to meet yes what you need is to [Applause] meet that's what you need amen all right now finally because we will continue uh is the page what you need is to meet then we'll come to where he says have you met MC since the battle is over and that's why what he did to Abraham the same thing he will do he will do the same thing to you as of the Seed of Abraham okay amen yeah I have I have this one I will keep it like that where it says and to repeat it again all right why we read these things it is because how many remember that's that subject the migration of the Seed of Abraham Abraham amen I'm on my way to Glory now the people there are people here that are on their way right here but they are on their way to Glory L they were chosen before the foundation of Satan means nothing to [Applause] them they are Sons and Daughters of the [Applause] God MEC MC brother you must keep on singing that song Now you listen in closing here brother says what you need do you need what do you need is to meet this that's what you need you can pray 10 times a day Ste what you need toet [Music] [Applause] prayers without MC they don't take they won't take you that far amen how God loved us so much he even came as one of us amen now there's a day that is coming there is coming a day there's a day that is coming amen uh now that's where he says we are getting where MC is amen we are on a great journey amen amen one day we are going to meet him and we will realize that he has made us to be like him [Music] I wonder is there somebody here who has that longing hunger in his heart sometimes you'll find me sh why because there is something driving you to him you are he is in you but there is something in you because you still need to meet him when you can shake [Applause] his do you believe it do you believe that one day you'll be able to shake the of Jesus do you believe that amen I I I believe it amen they say the longer I serve him the the sweeter yes am the longer you serve him the sweeter it becomes I'm on my [Music] way I don't see anything in this world that can give me peace he is my peace but there yet there's one thing to meet him when we leave this place do you know that the time is n to leave this place and meet him how many are thinking of that that one day you Jesus face to face and you'll be able to hold him by the hand and he will walk you [Applause] around do you have that in your it's going to be nice it's going to be beautiful there's nothing for me in this [Music] world
