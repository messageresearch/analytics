[1:08:10] said now see
[1:08:20] down now the one who is
[1:08:23] remaining is the pastor
[1:08:27] amen the apparent
[1:08:29] now is the
[1:08:32] pastor if they got a problem they must
[1:08:36] go to the
[1:08:37] pastor not to the
[1:08:39] apparent the apparent have said they
[1:08:41] must see
[1:08:45] them now they are left with me
[1:08:50] here I'm the
[1:08:53] pastor the B uh my brother and my
[1:08:58] sister I'm going to join you in this
[1:09:00] holy
[1:09:03] matrimony the Bible says
[1:09:07] here whatever God has Str
[1:09:12] together no
[1:09:14] man should put them
[1:09:18] as no
[1:09:22] magistrate no pastor
[1:09:25] should put them
[1:09:28] as no
[1:09:31] man you see when God puts things
[1:09:36] together here on Earth just like now you
[1:09:40] are
[1:09:41] here God is going to join you
[1:09:45] together when he joins you together
[1:09:49] today it means he he had joined you
[1:09:52] together
[1:09:53] that before the foundation of the
[1:09:59] world because he says here he that made
[1:10:03] them in the
[1:10:05] beginning he made them male and
[1:10:10] female while you are in a spirit
[1:10:14] real God Made
[1:10:16] You male and female and When God Made
[1:10:20] You male and
[1:10:22] female you were in His image
[1:10:25] [Music]
[1:10:27] and the image of
[1:10:28] God is male and
[1:10:31] female if if there is no
[1:10:34] male the image is not complete if there
[1:10:38] is no female the female is not complete
[1:10:42] that's why Jesus Christ after God has
[1:10:45] restored
[1:10:47] Adam he had to restore
[1:10:50] Eve and he rest Eve during seven Church
[1:10:56] he was restoring his
[1:10:59] wife until at the end
[1:11:02] now we at the end of the seven Church
[1:11:07] age because every
[1:11:09] messenger comes at the end of the
[1:11:13] age in other words our messenger
[1:11:16] here has come at the End of the
[1:11:19] Age We Are No More in
[1:11:22] L we are above l
[1:11:26] physically I can say I I am
[1:11:29] in but spiritually I am out
[1:11:34] of God has done his work he has
[1:11:38] restored that's why when we 10 we see
[1:11:44] him
[1:11:45] coming with the book
[1:11:47] open why because he's bringing the the
[1:11:51] marriage
[1:11:53] certificate because the marriage has
[1:11:56] been done
[1:11:57] here that he spre
[1:12:00] the now I can say here we are married we
[1:12:05] are the people who
[1:12:08] qualifies to join people
[1:12:11] together because it's not me training
[1:12:15] people it's God who's training them
[1:12:19] because he says if they accept you they
[1:12:23] accept me if they reject you they reject
[1:12:27] me if you reject the one who who sent
[1:12:33] you reject him I am the one who sent I
[1:12:39] am the pastor here
[1:12:42] [Music]
[1:12:47] [Music]
[1:12:56] what God has TR
[1:13:00] together God said telling job where were
[1:13:05] you
[1:13:06] job when the sons of God were
[1:13:10] shouting when I was laying the
[1:13:14] foundation you were there
[1:13:17] shouting you were there shouting in
[1:13:22] a sister and brother
[1:13:25] Sons and Daughters of
[1:13:27] God they
[1:13:29] shouting if you are the child of God now
[1:13:33] it means you were the child of God
[1:13:36] then if you not the child of God then
[1:13:39] you will never be the child of God
[1:13:44] [Music]
[1:13:46] here but there is a
[1:13:50] problem a
[1:13:52] sister can you see a brother
[1:13:56] he thinks a Son of
[1:13:59] God but only to find it is not the of
[1:14:04] God is From
[1:14:06] Below because always where the children
[1:14:09] of God
[1:14:11] meet Satan comes there also then when
[1:14:15] you see somebody singing cores you think
[1:14:20] he the child of God but he from
[1:14:24] Below thinking is a child of God when he
[1:14:27] propose you you accept his proposition
[1:14:31] but you accept the proposition from
[1:14:33] someone from
[1:14:36] below and that marriage will never be
[1:14:44] successful but the marriage from
[1:14:47] God because if you are from
[1:14:51] God you have got the
[1:14:53] nature of God
[1:14:55] because you are a son if you are a son
[1:14:58] of God the nature of your
[1:15:02] father God is the
[1:15:05] weight if you are if you are the Son of
[1:15:08] God it means you are part of the
[1:15:13] weight you are the weight you are the
[1:15:16] weight
[1:15:18] manifested in flesh now
[1:15:22] here but you must you must be
[1:15:27] sure Satan is going to test your
[1:15:33] un he's going to test you be sure of
[1:15:38] that Satan is going to test your
[1:15:48] un God is at your
[1:15:51] side you always conquer him
[1:15:55] if you follow the right
[1:15:59] channel you always conquer
[1:16:02] him if you don't follow the right
[1:16:05] chel he will he will destroy your your
