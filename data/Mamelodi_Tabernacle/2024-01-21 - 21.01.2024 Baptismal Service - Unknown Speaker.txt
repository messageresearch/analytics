Christ that his soul that his soul was not left in Hell neither his flesh did see corruption this Jesus has God raised up whereof we are we we all are witnesses therefore being by the right hand of God exalted and having raised received of the Father the promise of the Holy Ghost he had shed forth these which he now see and hear for David is not ascended into the heavens but he has he said but he said himself the Lord said unto my Lord sit thou at my right hand until I make thy fo thy foot stool therefore let all the house of Israel know accurately that God had made that same Jesus who whom you have crucified both Lord and Christ and when they he this they were pred in their heart and said unto Peter and to the rest of the Apostles men and Brethren what shall we do then Peter said unto them repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and he shall receive the gift of the Holy Holy Ghost for the promise is unto you and to your children and to all that are a far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call and with many other words did he testify and exalt saying save yourself from this unow generation then they that gladly
