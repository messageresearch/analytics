happen to be to arrive here all the way from Malawi uh amen [Applause] we also last night were struggling from just from Pretoria to come here nice you've all the way from the long way I don't know um yeah that is also our our pastor in Malawi um deeply together involved in the Supernatural Ministries amen and then this is our uh profession um and it's also our possession because you know abusa we are not only for profession but for possession God bless you say Amen I think he arrived here for a very young of a pasta or opiate and then when he hit that we are this site he decided to follow us you know it's so wonderful to meet with the Brethren because we believe we were together even before the foundation of the world and every time we meet is just Joy it's a cutting it's a cartoon let me just read some few um I will few nuggets from the Bible again um okay now I'm going to tend to Ephesians chapter 5 verse 3233 is that we um so we will just read from the Bible abusa if you may just say a word of prayer for the proceedings God bless you amen amen gracious Heavenly Father we thank you for this opportunity yes that you have gathered us together because this is a recovering we already gathered before you before the foundation of the world Amen and you told that to Joe and we believe it today we are gathering here for the marriage of our brother and sister amen Jesus you are the one who did the first marriage and they were not two they were one and their name was Adam come down with Jesus and restore the Adam who is before you now because if they will go back to Adam they will be going to problems amen because we need that Adam which was in your in his headquarters in the east of the I don't know either thank you Father for the ministry thank you for our pastor as is standing here you should be you speaking just behind the skin because that's what you did in the Bible times you were behind the skin and you were talking that's what we want to see today that we should see you speaking from behind the skin amen as we're committing ourselves into that Holy hands father you have your children even here yeah in this place father there are some here who were predestinated to be in this message amen we pray the Lord that you open in their eyes of understanding you will open their ears of understanding for you said that he was good here Lord Jesus the one who created the ear that means he hears better the one who created the eye that means he sees better amen do that to us father as of committing ourselves and uh as we surrender our souls as we send our secret under the control of them Holy Spirit in Jesus Christ and we pray amen amen amen God bless you you may be seated okay now introducing ourselves ourselves Tina we shall say we are Christians this is [Applause] that is introducing ourselves amen amen now the scripture says and I will say for a few minutes and I'll take the scripture versage brother are we in Ephesians chapter 5 verse 30. yes 34 we are members of his body of his flesh and of his bones for this cause shall a man leave his father and mother and shall be joined unto his wife and they too shall be one flesh this is a great mystery but I speak concerning Christ in the church nevertheless let every one of you in particular so love his wife even as himself and the wife see that she reverends her husband we may be seated God bless you say all right brother let us introduce ourselves we are members let's see it I see we are members of this boat of his body okay now this is marriage they call it the first institution but it is that God introduced amen amen and firstly uh if I read umang Funda chapter 5 of Genesis I find uh where it's it says one this is the book of the generations of Adam in the day that God created man in the likeness of God made him yes first two male and female created he them and bless them and call their name can somebody say Adam Adam uh called their name Adam not other men if Adam Adam and God bless you when Adam in the day when they were created they were called foreign Adam amen the name if came later after the fall is God called them Adam and Adam called her if um so I think we are aware of that meaning that marriage is a restoration because they were one and that the name was one but the fall separated them when the serpent came and mud the plan of God is a important and Adam said to the woman uh that is a Genesis chapter 3 verse 20. and Adam called his wife's name Eve because she was the mother of all living right foreign [Music] he called them Adam um but after the fall Emperor Adam not God now awesome his wife's name why because he she is the mother of all living that means she's the mother of Kane she's the mother of Abel now the name has changed all right now for a few minutes um we read here now we are the members of his body is okay of his flesh and of his bones amen that's why in reality you won't find divorce in there in the family of God um foreign now how can one divorce itself you see my fingers it can't because it is the two shall be one yeah and if God puts them together he says no one should put them as under again because in God they should remains just a little bit now it says for we are members so we as Christians here we are his body Tina generals for this course a man live his father and mother and child be joined unto his wife because originally God never said girlfriend he said amen the language was wife have you ever had anything or God promising a girlfriend a boyfriend that is from creation the woman the Bible says the woman was created for the man later pipelines Lisa you'll find it in your Bible where it is Corinthians chapter 7 if you are sure read it foreign to demand the the woman was created for the man amen amen starting there from the creation so now it says do you find do you find that scripture I think you were looking for chapter eight yeah or you are looking for say it chapter 7 verse okay all right let's carry on I read here therefore we are members of this body we are members of his body of his flesh of his bones for this course shall a man leave his father and mother and shall be joined unto his wife amen are you still looking for that script seven that's right for a man indeed ought not to cover his head for as much as he is the image and glory of God but the woman is the glory of the man for the man is not of the woman but the woman of the man neither was the Man created for the woman but the woman for the men yes the the woman was created for the man that's wonderful all right so she's a help meet from the creation itself um now I met a woman she used to work at Standard Bank again Standard Bank thank you you managed to go through and find that scripture I met her I said I didn't see you these days behind the I was Muslim the Disco what do you call it the bank account um and then she said to me I'm no longer working she said because God said to Adam I will make you Catalina watches amen amen so I was just helping him and I said how do you know that part of the Bible said yes okay that's that now I read it for we are members of his body of his flesh of his bones now for this cause Shah a man leave his father and mother [Music] now allow me to repeat this you know Adam was not born Adam was created after Satan murdered the plan of God it was by creation that's why we must be born again because the Bible says man born of four of a woman but a few days that's why this body of mine foreign because this one came by predestination of God the two here's the marriage the other one created for another now it's a 80 for for for this course for this course that we are members of his body and of his flesh and of his bones shall a man leave his father and mother because originally he had no father and mother for months who was the mother of Adam who was the father foreign and to his wife because already according to the program of amen you know that's why was that a man now Abraham when he sent out the eldest in his house he said to him go and find a wife for my son whatever okay not and look for foreign Rebecca and the Bible says the elders in the house of Abraham when he arrived there it was in the evening time [Music] amen amen in the evening time is women came for to collect water in the evening time after the hours Let Me Maybe say this to you again now at that time after the hours women came to collect water commands and you can all you all know they were not at their best they were tipped they had taken off what they had during the day because it is the time when women start to be busy collecting water so they they can be at their business why because she was not supposed to look at the hair best she was a wife to the son of Abraham when daughter came only to find yeah why where's he gave him the science and the man was also struggling the messenger how do I find a wife of not just a mere man but for a son of going to look because uh like if God sends out somebody to find his bride um the bread of Christ what kind of man this man should be young and how will his mind operates or his thoughts you know it won't just be a woman should be something very special because all right now that man started to look for a wife you know until she arrived at the well you know what what happened there because she was asking she didn't want to to do something wrong amen amen that assignment you know he must be she must choose the right one how do you choose the right one um you can't unless the Bible says she was created for him all right how did you find your the right one um [Applause] did you put on a new suit or did she put on something you know what talking today oh that's enough I prayed if you haven't yet received the Lord Jesus Christ you can marry because you can't even make the right choice because the right trains can be made only in Christ [Applause] he came to redeem us foreign no he went he went down why it said his answer waited there women came up that evening but she prayed she couldn't choose but why not was okay and say this one again but she prayed for God to make the choice there's so many of them yes but which one here God had to give direction about Rebecca he started by asking for water he started like that she said I shall not only give to you what again I shall continue to serve because [Music] um [Applause] [Music] so by the signs that God gave to him [Applause] according to the science all right amen and you know it happened from from there you know what happened and he wanted to know the parents wife and she led him the place and Away brother finally now foreign the brothers that was the brothers when he arrived there um there is something that he has said amen amen you know what yeah what did he says Genesis 24 he has 44. just listen to what he said then that's where I'll end verse 45 and before I had done speaking in my heart behold Rebecca came forth with her picture on her shoulder uh he was not written 32 Brothers yes before Rebecca was already there and she started to serve already told Rebecca came forth with her picture on her shoulder and she went down onto the well and Drew water and I said unto her let me drink I pray thee and she made haste and let down her picture from her shoulder and said drink and I will give thy camels drink also so I drank and she made the cayman's drink also amen but we go further now there said to to to him but again before they said to him to be your wife did you know what happened you know the scripture then Laban and Beth will answered and said the thing proceeded from the Lord we cannot speak unto thee bad or good behold Rebecca is before thee take him and go and let her be thy Master son's wife as the Lord has spoken and it came to pass that when Abraham 7 had their weights he worshiped the Lord bowing himself to the Earth yes go and go and harbor I wondered as the Lord has spoken okay they say it proceedeth brother go back it's verse 50. yes then Laban and Beth will answer and said the thing proceedeth from the Lord we cannot speak unto their bad or good yes we as have brothers okay we won't interfere the thing is we don't involve ourselves in that matter it is in the hands of the Lord it says and then behold Rebecca is before they take here and go and let her be thy Master son's wife as the Lord has spoken yes [Applause] that's where the matter ends as the Lord has spoken let it be done according to the spoken word the thing proceeded this marriage is coming from coming from God himself as his brother as his brothers we are we are not involved in that matter amen [Music] yes the Lord had spoken Jehovah is if we had an ear to listen to God all of our things were gonna be in line we were between things according to his wage if all of us we could do according to the spoken word um he has said it aligned that's just that that's how Rebecca was found for Isaac amen [Applause] they came one day and that is I don't want to continue to read masalani I I I'm at the end of the whole thing they said but why um why did Moses allow them amen watini because of the hotness of your heart we are once alone but do you know that scriptures the Bible it ends up saying from the beginning it was not sorry you know even how polygamy came in yeah [Music] so go to the beginning it is the way this is chapter 19 from verse 3. the Pharisees also came unto him tempting him and saying unto him is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause and he answered and said unto them have you not read that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female and said for this cause shall a man live father and mother and shall cleave to his wife and their twin shall be one flesh wherefore they are no more trained but one flesh one therefore God has joined together let no man put asunder amen amen Faris is therefore what God has put together let no man um all right who said that I'm dead okay now I'm going to to call our brother and our sister oh that the way through 14 and 482 to come forth I am sure there's a sort of maybe chorus or what
