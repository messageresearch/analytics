TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] What? &gt;&gt; Most interesting. That's why &gt;&gt; a notable thing because rest of them just seem ordinary. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now the problem &gt;&gt; is [Music] [Applause] people are being confused by &gt;&gt; now if God something out there &gt;&gt; to go to another dimension. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; And it comes &gt;&gt; he gives it wings. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To to take a flight. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, brother says, "And that angel came and hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now among the seven angels, he was looking at the one." &gt;&gt; He says, "That one is is the one with the seven." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now can you explain brother standing like this &gt;&gt; and talking about an angel with the seven s &gt;&gt; and you say wings wings. Yes wings but the prophet says &gt;&gt; the angels in heaven don't know about it. [Applause] Can we interpret who is this seven? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because &gt;&gt; the the angels don't know. &gt;&gt; He says they were out by it. What is that? &gt;&gt; But this they know. &gt;&gt; Who are they? &gt;&gt; Amen. [Music] If I can see my [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; sometimes I'm talking about myself. &gt;&gt; It doesn't apply somewhere else but I'm I'm trying to say something. &gt;&gt; If I can look at something coming flying &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; and &gt;&gt; and it's notable to me. So I won't worry about the news. &gt;&gt; No, &gt;&gt; because &gt;&gt; when it comes &gt;&gt; here &gt;&gt; the Bible says the woman was given wings &gt;&gt; to fly into the wilderness. &gt;&gt; Exactly. &gt;&gt; Did you see Israel flying? &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; That woman was Israel. Yeah. &gt;&gt; The Bible says she was given wings. [Music] &gt;&gt; And again, I'm told that the old and the new testament to &gt;&gt; you have church ages and amen. &gt;&gt; Now for the rapture, you don't need the old testament. &gt;&gt; No. And when you come, you must find the the new which is the seven changes and the six. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Give you the capacity. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; To fly out. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Otherwise you have your wings by the turbulence &gt;&gt; and crash. There were people who would say, "Brother Ben is my man. He's my prophet." And the next thing they say is a false prophet. &gt;&gt; We call it an air crash. &gt;&gt; Somebody comes to say, "I'm above brother." Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now we look for the black box. What caus this? &gt;&gt; Amen. [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; Lucifer crashed &gt;&gt; and the black box tell the story that he wanted to build up. Exactly. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because the first thing when there is a crash exactly &gt;&gt; was found what caused the accident. Lucifer wanted to build &gt;&gt; that. [Music] &gt;&gt; He fell so hot. Yes, &gt;&gt; saw him when he hit the dish there. &gt;&gt; What happened? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; He couldn't answer because he was listening. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, brother Brennan had to connect with the angel in order to &gt;&gt; inter. &gt;&gt; Now, if he interprets that, &gt;&gt; yes, &gt;&gt; how can an ordinary person &gt;&gt; hear it? Hey, &gt;&gt; unless it's from his &gt;&gt; your Exactly. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because it's good time. &gt;&gt; Exactly. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you believe that? For for for for us to see these things, we have to pick them from our if it is eternity. This body is time. &gt;&gt; That's why brother Bren says the Lord had to come and sprinkle his blood there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To redeem. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That place. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And that's why now he the purpose being that he should bring the men back there. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; So that he can the network can &gt;&gt; that's why then when brother was there now &gt;&gt; standing in the gap. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For what brother? &gt;&gt; Let me ask brother why standing in the gap. Because now that gap if God redeemed something &gt;&gt; that means he brings it back to where it was. No &gt;&gt; I don't I don't I don't have &gt;&gt; I don't have standing in the gap book here but it says &gt;&gt; amen I the angel lifted me up. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Yes. &gt;&gt; Now, some people think that brother was picked up with jackets flying in the air by an angel falling and so &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, it's not a myth. &gt;&gt; No, &gt;&gt; the angel picked you up. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But for the angel to pick you up, &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; is like in the rapture. [Music] The angel picked him up. Now it is not like people were looking at brother and suddenly they saw him flying in the air. &gt;&gt; Oh my god. &gt;&gt; West then he would be a UFO. [Music] &gt;&gt; When he met with the angel he came back listen to do what? to reveal. Now, time won't allow me, but page 11 tells you that he tore off the seal and sent it down to the seventh angel for him to reveal the church. &gt;&gt; Now, the people are looking for it up there. That's why they miss it &gt;&gt; because it was brought down &gt;&gt; to a man but the man blinds them because it says the lamp. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; As we say when when Moses came to Egypt the Bible the word said Jehovah shall deliver them. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But then who came? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. [Music] &gt;&gt; It's difficult if Jehovah says something and somebody comes like Moses and says I'm sent from the I am &gt;&gt; follow it was very difficult for Abraham &gt;&gt; to be able to say to somebody you see the man eating Hey eating chicken there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It was very difficult. &gt;&gt; Now, brother says he saw him when he stepped in. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He saw the halo of light. &gt;&gt; Three halos of light. Now when he says when he stepped into human &gt;&gt; then he said then he knew that it &gt;&gt; is a man [Applause] &gt;&gt; bring one [Music] &gt;&gt; with dusty feet &gt;&gt; with dusty feet &gt;&gt; under a [Applause] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now Elohim &gt;&gt; came into brotherham [Music] &gt;&gt; and opened these things to us. Jehovah &gt;&gt; came into Moses &gt;&gt; and deliver them. [Applause] as it was. Yes. [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; As Elohim, &gt;&gt; the selfexistent one &gt;&gt; came like a fly &gt;&gt; into a red [Applause] He created himself in body and [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; So simple. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So simple. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We search for the eating under a tree there. Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We sat under a tribute. Brother &gt;&gt; is a man like me. &gt;&gt; But God the reason why it was silent. &gt;&gt; It is because the network &gt;&gt; was from God to a &gt;&gt; which is the heart. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. The mighty God. Amen. Then it came to brother. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why revelation 10. That's why where he came through the god of honor with the book and he couldn't interpret that. He couldn't reveal that book because it belonged to mankind. &gt;&gt; But he as there was no man with &gt;&gt; he opened a book took the books from within himself. &gt;&gt; That is the mysteries. put them into brother &gt;&gt; I can put my head on &gt;&gt; he took it and put in Moses and Moses came and said my people &gt;&gt; he came and put it in Elijah and Elisha said I want your spirit Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That is amen. &gt;&gt; So the seals were put in. Amen. &gt;&gt; In order to be received by me. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Now the seventh seal. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; The reason the reason they say okay I'm picking now. &gt;&gt; Remember I'm a pecking creature now. Ready to go. &gt;&gt; Okay. Ready to go. &gt;&gt; Now, the reason that there's a reason let's look at it. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Well, the reason is that the servants, he said nothing. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; In heaven. &gt;&gt; And then there was a man standing on earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; The message was sent down to &gt;&gt; the seven &gt;&gt; men. &gt;&gt; That's why they don't &gt;&gt; they read about it. I I can read something here quickly. You listen to it.

She doesn't care about advertisements and all the other &gt;&gt; and so forth the name &gt;&gt; there is it is in rich class. &gt;&gt; Yes. Then the next thing I I watched them one time at the boys papers there they were there group of girls and boys. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; They were looking at that and I could see those who have gone through because after looking said &gt;&gt; and I could see that oh yeah that one has passed. &gt;&gt; Amen.

Now I want us to answer so that I can close. Now &gt;&gt; what the sixth seal is &gt;&gt; prophet. &gt;&gt; Prophet. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Who opened it? &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, did you hear God saying the six is Elijah and Moses? &gt;&gt; But you believe it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; No. And here the six seals is open. Well, that's a mysterious thing. &gt;&gt; Here's the secret of it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Page 433 your book seven seals. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now the mystery of the six seal is &gt;&gt; we agree &gt;&gt; or do we agree that it's &gt;&gt; prophets? Now the mystery of the seventh seal is &gt;&gt; now you say to a Jew the person is Elible to me. That's why that thing is God's type of internet. Amen. &gt;&gt; You can't get it anywhere. &gt;&gt; It must be from him to you. [Music] &gt;&gt; That's why he says tell no man. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord. &gt;&gt; He said brother this is the the pool. Tell it to no man. &gt;&gt; Why? &gt;&gt; Why brother? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. because each and everyone should receive it the way I &gt;&gt; it don't it doesn't come by preaching &gt;&gt; it's a personal &gt;&gt; no one can say I today I have received the seal the pastor preacher bought it &gt;&gt; no &gt;&gt; you have amen But now you must see. &gt;&gt; Okay. I I I can read in the book that it is a personal &gt;&gt; a personal expression of God in me. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said to them, Peter said, "Thou art the Christ, &gt;&gt; son of the living God." And he said to him, &gt;&gt; "Tell this to me. &gt;&gt; I Jesus am the Christ." &gt;&gt; Amen. That means the other person must receive it. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Right now I'm glad and there is the six se is the six seals open. Say well that's a mysterious thing. But the question is now um here is the secret of it. The prophet says they discovered it &gt;&gt; and they open. &gt;&gt; Brother discovered the seven churches. &gt;&gt; He said I discovered seven things in the Bible. &gt;&gt; Then he found them and he preached &gt;&gt; now they discovered the six. He says they discovered the seal &gt;&gt; and they are going now to open it to the Jews &gt;&gt; and to introduce them to the Messiah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because they are still waiting for the Messiah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So finally that's why &gt;&gt; yes &gt;&gt; the Lord left the intercessory box. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Maybe somebody will put up Children of God. &gt;&gt; I mean when he took the book &gt;&gt; he left the inter &gt;&gt; because the blood applies &gt;&gt; up to the seventh church. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now brother saying but we are baptizing the people. I said yes. &gt;&gt; He took the book to train. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; When the seals were open in that year, &gt;&gt; you were in the in [Music] &gt;&gt; that that has got nothing to do with your predestination. &gt;&gt; Amen. But he came with the book to claim you. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He's been claiming &gt;&gt; Oh my god. [Music] [Applause] It's not a church individ [Applause] and brother says he's after he was kicked out of the church &gt;&gt; then as he was kicked out because a church is a group of people. Yeah, a pastor can stand up and say the seven is not revealed and the children will say &gt;&gt; you see now he's a church. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; But then after he is kicked out then he comes and knocks at the individual. [Applause] &gt;&gt; We don't want him in the church anymore. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now listen, let's close with this. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Christ is now is now not welcome &gt;&gt; in the churches. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In the churches, they've got their laws, their rules. &gt;&gt; Now he comes and knock. Amen. &gt;&gt; He says if &gt;&gt; a man not a church &gt;&gt; a man hears my voice. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Before you open you hear first &gt;&gt; a voice. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The voice of the seven. &gt;&gt; If a man hears my voice and open the door. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Open the door. He says then I will come in &gt;&gt; so he opened &gt;&gt; yes &gt;&gt; who's there &gt;&gt; the third pool the seven [Applause] &gt;&gt; and somebody will close the door [Music] said nothing Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But if you open, he doesn't come and chat with you. He comes in &gt;&gt; and s is the evening. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So the reason he left the sanctuary &gt;&gt; which we can read here that when he took the book, he left the the intercessory. &gt;&gt; And after that he gave to the &gt;&gt; to his seventh angel to reveal to the people. &gt;&gt; Then he took away the &gt;&gt; forerunner. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And the forerunner before he left he said the unveiling of God [Music] &gt;&gt; because the the the mediator is being a vain between us and God couldn't see through. &gt;&gt; We see the messenger. We see the mediator. We can't see through. Oh, amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The spirits are in the mediator &gt;&gt; for the men to come back. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And connect with the angel &gt;&gt; after you connected. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Something that I've never it from anywhere &gt;&gt; where is it &gt;&gt; after he connected because this is seven angels &gt;&gt; coming but there's one in &gt;&gt; you know now now listen what he says here &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; now he he had to leave the box because he's a shield &gt;&gt; then took away the prophet because &gt;&gt; before is also a Amen. &gt;&gt; The first veil turn off &gt;&gt; and the second &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. So all of these veins he had to open &gt;&gt; so that we can see [Music] &gt;&gt; that's why now today I'm not saying brother who says the seven is this I'm saying it is this [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; now now listen what he says The angel was veryable to me. The rest of them just seem ordinary. But this angel was a noted angel was to my left in the constellation in a form of a pyramid. And you remember it was in the pyramid where the mysterious white rock was not written. &gt;&gt; And the angels took me into the pyramid of themselves. &gt;&gt; Now this is the pyramid of the angels. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Not of boulders. No, &gt;&gt; but of the angels to put them in and because brother stood there as the right hand man. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Because the book was in the right. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Came down to brother. Hallelujah. [Music] The one whom we come to say [Applause] [Music] [Applause] that's why it was coming down the right hand [Applause] [Music] and come to the right hand [Applause] Amen. &gt;&gt; People can leave their revelations and come to the right hand. &gt;&gt; So he says now &gt;&gt; then the mysterious rope was not written in and the angels took me into the pyramid of &gt;&gt; and you know when the angels left as they go up up it was a cloud a mysterious cloud. It was the face of the Yes. [Music] &gt;&gt; And says they left where I was staying. &gt;&gt; So he was represented among the angels &gt;&gt; and they left where he was staying &gt;&gt; and now as it went out up it was the head of the Lord Jesus. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The church is captive. &gt;&gt; And now the branch has received. [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; It was with him &gt;&gt; in the system. Amen. When he was a spirit, I was a spirit. [Applause] When he was famous, &gt;&gt; when we became [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; what we teaching is our position. [Music] says there's a sign and a [Music] &gt;&gt; just he says the sign tells you 65 km &gt;&gt; so you come to the sign then you leave the sign for 20 &gt;&gt; it is our commission &gt;&gt; that's why I tell I told the brother He said the sick and such and such day hospital they going to get rid of her legs. So I said don't worry give me the name of your &gt;&gt; after I said I call you wherever you ask him. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] And &gt;&gt; pastor, yes, my aunties with her legs [Music] from Zimbabwe &gt;&gt; after spending a lot of money What else? They came and sister [Music] [Music] therapy. [Applause] [Music] And I said now expect your child [Music] &gt;&gt; charities for [Applause] last month they meas when we left Zimbabwe was here for God to do this for us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The child is two months now. [Applause] And you can say move if you move this [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; angels to inter [Music] I don't know if the world can take this. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The mystery is here. And it says the mystery &gt;&gt; of the rock. &gt;&gt; Now if you say the mystery of the rock, you still &gt;&gt; If you say thankful, you are still talking about &gt;&gt; that's where he met you. Now it says the mystery of the rock not written on and the angels took me in that pyramid &gt;&gt; and the mysteries only known to them. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Who are they? Because those other angels don't know about these things. &gt;&gt; But why? Who are this? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. And then it says, "Angels took me in that and they were the messengers that come to interpret that pyramid or that message of the secret of the seven. They were actually coming to interpret that that pyramid." But he means that sto [Music] mysteries of the seals which lays within. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Inside the pyramid. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah, &gt;&gt; because they were not written. &gt;&gt; The angel was to my left would have been the last &gt;&gt; or seventh angel. &gt;&gt; Seventh angel is talking about the seventh angel. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If we would count them from left to right because he was on my left, me looking to him towards the west, you coming towards the east would be on the left side. So that would be the last angel. &gt;&gt; Amen. message. &gt;&gt; Very notable. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You remember kind of his head back and great sharp wings. &gt;&gt; Great sharp wings. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Interpret wings. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Great. The sharp ones. &gt;&gt; The word of God is sharp. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And how he flew right to me. &gt;&gt; God. Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord. &gt;&gt; Oh my god. It is &gt;&gt; It is on lifeline. &gt;&gt; Exactly. &gt;&gt; How the angel flew right to me. &gt;&gt; That is the seventh seal. &gt;&gt; The seventh seal &gt;&gt; is the angel that flow right away. [Music] page 578 of your &gt;&gt; Now you look at brother Brandon. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; The angel fly flew right over him &gt;&gt; and you no longer see the angel.
