[51:29] pray Heavenly Father you know better as
[51:32] as human being we may go to a certain

[52:06] are going to read a portion of the
[52:07] scripture we know Lord God many books we
[52:11] read from the universities and so forth
[52:13] but this is the only book that is stand
[52:16] for Eternal Lord God may you bless the
[52:18] word as we're going to read this evening
[52:20] as we put all unto your capable hand in
[52:23] the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus
[52:25] Christ amen amen
[52:27] amen amen we are going to read from the
[52:31] book of John chapter
[52:34] 18 18 verse 4 to8 ver 8 amen amen
[52:40] wanting to tell you again
[52:43] that our pastor isra in
[52:47] m is the one that said we must come here
[52:50] to comfort the
[52:53] family if it was possible he was going
[52:56] to
[52:57] here but due to some reasons beyond our
[53:03] control we are here on his
[53:07] behalf may God richly bless him as well
[53:11] and the entire
[53:13] church one of the reason we are using
[53:16] two languages
[53:17] here English and
[53:20] SP is because we have international
[53:23] viewers
[53:27] we have another National people that
[53:30] does not
[53:32] know at least English they can
[53:35] hear so do not be
[53:41] surprised speaking in English because
[53:43] only of that
[53:45] reason please bear with us for
[53:50] only will be
[53:53] well God bless you amen amen
[54:03] yes Jesus therefore knowing all things
[54:06] that should come upon him went forth and
[54:09] said unto them whom seek ye they
[54:12] answered him Jesus of Nazareth Jesus
[54:15] said unto them I am he and Judas also
[54:19] which betrayed him stood with them as
[54:22] soon as then as he had said unto them I
[54:25] am he
[54:26] they went backward and fell to the
[54:29] ground then asked them again whom seek
[54:33] ye and they said Jesus of Nazareth Jesus
[54:36] answered I have told you that I am he if
[54:40] therefore you seek me let this go their
[54:43] way amen amen you may be
[54:46] seated
[54:49] amen I want to share with you
[54:54] tonight about life beyond the
[54:59] grave amen amen because there is life
[55:03] beyond
[55:07] death what pain us is
[55:11] that we won't see The Departed again in
[55:15] a caral
[55:18] body and that bring an inward pain to
[55:23] us but the real life
[55:26] the spiritual
[55:28] life the real life is the life beyond
[55:31] the
[55:32] grave because that life is life
[55:36] eternal amen amen the one we have
[55:40] today is life
[55:43] temporal and the word of God teaches us
[55:46] that
[55:48] everything everything that you can see
[55:52] with your Naked Eyes is temporal
[55:56] maybe a
[55:58] car maybe a house maybe
[56:02] clothes maybe your body because you can
[56:05] see it with a naked
[56:07] eye it's
[56:09] temporal one of the days it will come to
[56:12] an end but if we can look at the life
[56:16] beyond the grave that's what we are
[56:19] longing
[56:20] for amen amen I for one I wake far from
[56:26] from my home I normally go home on
[56:30] weekends and normally when I leave my
[56:33] house my my my wife doesn't like
[56:36] something that I normally
[56:40] say I will normally say I will see you
[56:44] if I still come
[56:46] alive then he will say no we must go
[56:49] into the
[56:50] Rapture and we are all waiting for the
[56:53] Rapture but if the rapture tiries
[56:56] and death took me that's what I
[57:00] mean so whatever we are doing whenever
[57:04] we are going waiting for the Rapture but
[57:08] no
[57:09] death death is always next to
[57:12] us any
[57:14] time you can go amen amen that's that is
[57:18] the world we are living
[57:21] in I used to scare death but time goes
[57:26] by I start to realize who am I I start
[57:31] to to preach and look
[57:34] Beyond I start to realize that there is
[57:39] good life beyond the grave and that's
[57:43] what we want but the reason why we fear
[57:46] death sometimes in life we are very much
[57:51] unsure if you can close your eyes and
[57:55] imagine
[57:56] what will happen when you die you will
[58:00] fear death because you just see blank
[58:03] maybe you just see Darkness maybe you
[58:05] don't know whether you're going to make
[58:06] it to heaven and you start doing
[58:09] introspection you started looking
[58:11] whether I should die or not that's why
[58:15] when you survive in an accident you even
[58:17] give
[58:19] testimony because you don't want to
[58:22] die amen amen and that's natural
[58:27] are human beings even our Lord Jesus
[58:30] Christ he has to face death came here on
[58:35] Earth knowing that one of the days what
[58:39] happened before the foundation of the
[58:41] world should manifest and should
[58:45] manifest in him and he must die and die
[58:49] for
[58:51] us amen amen but one day when he fac
[58:55] death
[58:56] it was not
[58:58] easy he even say if it was
[59:02] possible this can pass but it was not
[59:06] possible that should happen because it's
[59:09] a God for ordained
[59:13] thing amen amen now here when he was
[59:17] facing death you know meeting this
[59:20] soldiers he asked them whom are you
[59:24] looking for when they say Jesus then he
[59:27] said here am I and they fell down amen
[59:32] amen definitely if it was me there I was
[59:36] going to run away and even give a
[59:38] testimony in the church that the
[59:41] soldiers were here I just say I am and
[59:45] fall I Walk Tall part of Jesus knew that
[59:52] his day has arrived because the the
[59:56] Bible says this day this scripture is
[1:00:01] fulfilled amen amen then he had to
[1:00:04] switch off that Heavenly
[1:00:08] power so that he may come to the
[1:00:11] level of the lamp Jesus was God but he
[1:00:16] was a lamp as well when he was God the
[1:00:20] soldiers fell when he is the lamb and
[1:00:24] they catch him was the Lamb of God he
[1:00:28] may be
[1:00:29] crucified for our sins
[1:00:33] forgiven was the Lord Jesus Christ amen
[1:00:36] amen then everybody that can see him
[1:00:41] they were feeling for him even Mary said
[1:00:44] for his son that he is going he will
[1:00:49] never come back
[1:00:50] alive L you know that after 3 days he
[1:00:54] will come back again
[1:00:56] he was God he can switch on the power
[1:01:00] and S of the power again so he allowed
[1:01:04] them to hold him Andy him amen amen but
[1:01:10] the
[1:01:11] devil the devil is short
[1:01:15] shortsighted he thought when he killed
[1:01:19] Jesus was the end of him only to find
[1:01:24] out that is the beginning of
[1:01:27] things amen amen because after the death
[1:01:31] of Jesus Christ that's where you and me
[1:01:35] came out of him and became the
[1:01:39] bride amen where they pierced
[1:01:43] him there of
[1:01:46] Jesus amen amen and from there on there
[1:01:50] are lot of
[1:01:52] activities many and many happen
[1:01:57] beyond the
[1:01:59] grave amen amen before the grave he was
[1:02:04] a young man at the age of 33 but beyond
[1:02:08] the grave he was called The Almighty the
[1:02:12] creator of Heaven and Earth that was our
[1:02:15] Lord Jesus Christ when he changed the
[1:02:19] mask God of being the Lamb of being a
[1:02:23] man and so on and so on
[1:02:26] amen amen now these soldiers if they
[1:02:29] were
[1:02:31] normal when somebody says who are you
[1:02:34] looking for and they they fell they
[1:02:38] could have run away to see the
[1:02:41] power men
[1:02:43] have amen but they
[1:02:46] stood off their clothes and still want
[1:02:50] to they don't know what is
[1:02:53] next allowed them lamp should be slain
[1:02:58] so that scripture should be fulfilled
[1:03:02] the lamp was
[1:03:04] slain the
[1:03:06] found amen amen so now you know when
[1:03:10] death come where where where I'm
[1:03:14] working side of
[1:03:16] lightting there were three young
[1:03:19] men the local you
[1:03:22] know yes so I was addressing them
[1:03:26] and they threatened me and even to kill
[1:03:30] me they they even wanted to kill me amen
[1:03:35] amen because when you come to an area
[1:03:38] having some project then you find the
[1:03:41] local community they have their
[1:03:44] representative they whatever they wanted
[1:03:46] to talk they come to me and they want to
[1:03:50] impose some of the things and they say
[1:03:53] you don't know us you don't know the
[1:03:55] area you don't know how to do things and
[1:03:57] you must pass up then I said to them you
[1:04:01] are still
[1:04:02] young uh you'll know me as time goes
[1:04:06] by I used to fear death but now I'm not
[1:04:11] scared of death if you kill me it's okay
[1:04:16] but sooner or later you will die as well
[1:04:19] to kill someone is not a
[1:04:22] solution then I said to them you are
[1:04:26] still young as you grow you
[1:04:29] understand then as we go and work and
[1:04:32] work and
[1:04:34] work they came to me they
[1:04:38] said we have met
[1:04:41] people but there was none like you you
[1:04:44] are so powerful there's a light in you
[1:04:48] always even if we have realized that
[1:04:52] when you are not at work things are not
[1:04:54] going right here
[1:04:56] so we need you always here we really
[1:04:59] apologize what we have said about you of
[1:05:02] you that other day we have realized that
[1:05:06] you are the men we need
[1:05:07] here then I said to them I told you even
[1:05:12] one amongst them poison me poisoned
[1:05:16] me in my food so that I can he came to
[1:05:21] me and tell me that he tried but I'm
[1:05:24] untable
[1:05:27] then I said well I was not aware of that
[1:05:31] and it brought the the confirmation to
[1:05:35] them this is something that we do not
[1:05:40] have and I can't tell you that those
[1:05:43] three young boys were SAS all of them
[1:05:47] they this R and
[1:05:50] white amen so they were testing how
[1:05:53] powerful their things can work
[1:05:57] just like these ones when they wanted to
[1:06:00] hold Jesus Christ and crucify him there
[1:06:04] are forces today that are from God that
[1:06:08] are from the devil and as we goes by
[1:06:12] they test each
[1:06:15] other amen amen it's something that you
[1:06:19] cannot
[1:06:20] deny something that we are working on on
[1:06:23] a daily basis
[1:06:27] the world we are living in is a No Man's
[1:06:30] Land there should be a
[1:06:32] force control
[1:06:35] you to do something that you do not even
[1:06:39] like we see Judas selling Jesus
[1:06:44] Christ
[1:06:46] pieces he didn't like
[1:06:49] it he was a friend to Jesus he was one
[1:06:53] of the disciples but there was a for
[1:06:57] overpowered him to commit what he did to
[1:07:01] our Lord
[1:07:02] Jus amen amen if you can find Judas and
[1:07:07] ask him he will tell you this I didn't
[1:07:10] want to do that but something said to me
[1:07:13] I must do this I must sell Jesus Christ
[1:07:17] because there's a force that is always
[1:07:19] coming to you let's read what brother
[1:07:22] Bram says he said we have a body and the
[1:07:26] body is a flesh and that flesh one of
[1:07:30] the day was rought but it was born by
[1:07:33] the sexual
[1:07:35] desire of a father and a mother and it
[1:07:38] must rot it's not good therefore the New
[1:07:44] Birth the the
[1:07:46] resurrection when you brought forth
[1:07:49] again in a new body it will be God
[1:07:53] creative power
[1:07:56] that he speak like he did to
[1:07:59] Adam come forth you know this flesh it
[1:08:04] can't help it it's temporal you need the
[1:08:08] spirit you need the soul to control the
[1:08:12] Flesh and when the spirit is controlling
[1:08:15] the flesh the flesh give
[1:08:19] way amen amen and then we have a soul a
[1:08:23] soul being the nature of the spirit
[1:08:26] and the soul is the one that God
[1:08:29] need and the soul is the something that
[1:08:33] the devil needs and from the soul if you
[1:08:37] controlled by the devil you want to help
[1:08:40] it but you do what the devil says You
[1:08:43] must do but from the soul if you believe
[1:08:48] God God there you can't help it when you
[1:08:51] try to do wrong God put you to do right
[1:08:58] amen that is from the
[1:09:01] soul being the controlling
[1:09:04] Tower of your life so beyond death we
[1:09:09] see the active
[1:09:13] Soul the Bible says when Jesus died on
[1:09:17] the cross remember they hold
[1:09:21] him they crucify him and they they they
[1:09:25] even have some
[1:09:28] dice to win
[1:09:30] his and the devil was happy and it was
[1:09:34] the end of
[1:09:35] him only to find that was the beginning
[1:09:38] of him now Beyond Death this is what
[1:09:43] happened us before the
[1:09:47] grave we see his body in the grave but
[1:09:52] beyond the grave the Bible says
[1:09:56] his Spirit went back to
[1:09:59] God but his soul went to the lower part
[1:10:03] of the
[1:10:06] world why going there the Bible says to
[1:10:11] preach to the lost
[1:10:14] soul the ones that did not believe the
[1:10:17] word of God during the time of Noah
[1:10:20] during the time of L during the old anti
[1:10:24] duilian
[1:10:27] ages he went there to preach to them not
[1:10:31] for the repentance but to tell them then
[1:10:34] for deny Noah you deny me that was the
[1:10:39] thing says that was the third pool thir
[1:10:44] pool is when you preach the message to
[1:10:47] the doomed not for the
[1:10:49] repentance but just a confirmation and
[1:10:53] in this last age
[1:10:55] see the message from the pull pit bring
[1:10:59] judgment to the people if you believe
[1:11:02] you are saved if you disbelieve you are
[1:11:07] damned so the message is not coming to
[1:11:11] bring the neutral
[1:11:15] position coming to show you who you are
[1:11:20] those that believe to believe those that
[1:11:24] deny
[1:11:27] deny the message is the
[1:11:29] light and in the
[1:11:32] light things are
[1:11:34] clear the light does not change things
[1:11:39] but the light made things to be more
[1:11:45] visible how are you going to take
[1:11:48] it if the
[1:11:50] wolf is preaching to the
[1:11:53] Sheep telling them
[1:11:56] that when you vote for
[1:12:00] me I will become a
[1:12:07] vegetarian and the Sheep will say p
[1:12:12] p but when they say p p if they were 100
[1:12:17] now they are 80 all of a sudden they are
[1:12:20] 50 all of a sudden the you know the craw
[1:12:23] is empty
[1:12:27] amen
[1:12:28] amen the condition does not
[1:12:32] change who you
[1:12:34] are in the beginning God knew our
[1:12:40] destination knew we will be here you
[1:12:43] know as human beings we must just come
[1:12:47] to a
[1:12:49] realization
[1:12:52] accepting what God is doing among us
[1:12:56] there are certain condition certain
[1:13:00] situation in life you cannot
[1:13:04] change amen amen so the best thing we
[1:13:07] can
[1:13:08] do is just to say Lord God you know
[1:13:13] better amen I know
[1:13:18] here he he wanted she wanted one of the
[1:13:22] days that sister
[1:13:25] bu him because naturally the elderly
[1:13:30] people as you
[1:13:33] age you come you you approach your
[1:13:38] departure and even in the Bible it says
[1:13:41] the old people in the Bible used to say
[1:13:45] we lived until this
[1:13:47] far they even ask God for now take us
[1:13:52] back home because we liveed
[1:13:55] and this life can give it to our
[1:13:58] children to
[1:14:01] continue amen am that that's natural but
[1:14:04] to bury your own
[1:14:06] children is something that is not good
[1:14:09] at all but who knows is God himself and
[1:14:14] why and there was a purpose that one of
[1:14:17] the days we will know better we will see
[1:14:21] better so God has prepared everything
[1:14:25] the way he wanted them from the
[1:14:27] beginning there's two things that you do
[1:14:30] not know about
[1:14:31] yourself the day you are born and the
[1:14:34] day you will depart but that is the
[1:14:37] secret that God has put in him that you
[1:14:41] were born in so date you will depart in
[1:14:46] so date is God knows and is the
[1:14:50] circumstance is the circumstance you
[1:14:53] cannot change
[1:14:55] let me continue with brother here he
[1:14:58] said is a question and answers they were
[1:15:01] asking this question about the
[1:15:04] difference between the body the spirit
[1:15:09] and the you know the soul he said job
[1:15:12] said I'll have a desire he speak and I
[1:15:17] will answer
[1:15:19] him see now the body is what you looking
[1:15:24] at
[1:15:25] the spirit is what controls you your
[1:15:29] soul is the motive of that
[1:15:32] Spirit or the nature of that Spirit the
[1:15:36] soul that
[1:15:38] sinth shall die amen amen you you are
[1:15:43] born in the
[1:15:44] world with a sinful
[1:15:49] soul that is the nature of your
[1:15:52] spirit it's sinful
[1:15:56] when you were born in this world you
[1:15:59] long for the things of the
[1:16:01] world then the Holy Ghost comes down and
[1:16:06] baptize you and changes the nature of
[1:16:09] that
[1:16:11] Spirit the nature of that Spirit that's
[1:16:14] left on you is of
[1:16:18] Heaven amen amen when you were born the
[1:16:22] nature was of sinful
[1:16:25] but when the Holy Ghost come bapti you
[1:16:30] all those things now your nature change
[1:16:34] becomes the nature of
[1:16:37] Heaven
[1:16:39] amen then you
[1:16:42] profess amen am that you are a pilgrim
[1:16:46] and a
[1:16:48] stranger then you are born from
[1:16:52] above then you are from above
[1:16:55] you are a candidate of
[1:16:58] Heaven you are a new creature in Christ
[1:17:02] Jesus with the same body with the same
[1:17:06] Spirit only is
[1:17:08] changed you know when we live he Chang
[1:17:13] me day by day little by little until we
[1:17:19] come to a St of a perfect man
[1:17:25] amen amen the life you live is the life
[1:17:28] you
[1:17:30] lived that life you lived you are living
[1:17:33] it today and is a life you're going to
[1:17:37] live in
[1:17:38] future because life
[1:17:41] eternal it's God's life God is eternal
[1:17:45] our pastor normally tells us that we
[1:17:48] were process from him if he is the life
[1:17:52] eternal we are the life eternal
[1:17:55] we are the word ourselves for God is the
[1:17:58] word
[1:18:01] himself amen amen I want us to read this
[1:18:04] scripture
[1:18:06] here
[1:18:09] H first Peter or before first Peter it
[1:18:14] will be my last scripture here on
[1:18:15] Ephesus chapter chapter
[1:18:20] 4 we will read verse 8 to9 Ephesians
[1:18:24] chap 4: 8
[1:18:29] to9 wherefore he said when he ascended
[1:18:33] up on high he led captivity captive and
[1:18:37] gave gifts unto men now that he ascended
[1:18:41] what is it but that he also descended
[1:18:44] first into the lower parts of the
[1:18:50] earth verse n
[1:18:52] yes why uh
[1:18:55] and and and to make all men see what is
[1:18:59] the fellowshipping of the mystery which
[1:19:01] from the beginning of the
[1:19:03] world uh have been laid in God who
[1:19:07] created All Things by Christ do you read
[1:19:09] until no yes okay amen amen so this is
[1:19:16] what happen beyond the grave when Jesus
[1:19:19] was died on the cross
[1:19:25] said his body was in the grave his soul
[1:19:31] Spirit went back to God his soul went to
[1:19:36] preach the lower
[1:19:40] world he preached to them that disb
[1:19:43] believe the word of God after preaching
[1:19:46] to them he
[1:19:48] ascended when he Ascend he went back to
[1:19:53] heaven with these
[1:19:58] Saints from that time we started to see
[1:20:02] two different
[1:20:04] places when somebody dies the soul that
[1:20:08] sin when it dies spiritually it goes
[1:20:14] lower when the soul that
[1:20:18] saved God beyond the grave goes up to
[1:20:22] God
[1:20:24] amen amen amen amen that's the message I
[1:20:28] love to pre bring
[1:20:30] tonight A Life Beyond
[1:20:34] Death you know when death
[1:20:37] come and you you
[1:20:40] pass you go
[1:20:42] beyond it's either you go down or you go
[1:20:46] up it's a it's a
[1:20:49] situation you as a person you cannot
[1:20:52] change that is why the Bible says we
[1:20:56] must
[1:20:57] always be ready for our Lord is
[1:21:02] coming am amen amen let's read the last
[1:21:07] scripture I was talking
[1:21:10] about in First
[1:21:18] Peter
[1:21:20] 3
[1:21:22] 18 2
[1:21:29] 18-21 for Christ also had once suffered
[1:21:32] for
[1:21:33] sins the just for the unjust that he
[1:21:36] might bring us to God being put to death
[1:21:40] in the flesh but but quickened by the
[1:21:43] Spirit by which also he went and
[1:21:46] preached unto the spirits in prison
[1:21:49] which sometime were disobedient when
[1:21:52] Once the longsuffering of God waited in
[1:21:56] the days of Noah while the ark was a
[1:22:00] preparing while the ark was a preparing
[1:22:03] werein few that his eight Souls were
[1:22:05] saved by water the like figure were un
[1:22:09] where unto even bapt baptism doth also
[1:22:13] now save us not the putting away of the
[1:22:16] filth of the flesh but the answer by the
[1:22:20] answer of a good conscience towards God
[1:22:24] by by the resurrection of Jesus Christ
[1:22:26] amen amen do you see that our Lord Jesus
[1:22:30] Christ when he died on the cross
[1:22:33] thinking is the end of him thinking is
[1:22:36] the end of
[1:22:37] him the people thinking that it was the
[1:22:40] end of him but beyond death he was more
[1:22:44] active than when he was here on Earth
[1:22:48] because he preached to the lost soul
[1:22:50] after preaching to the lost soul he went
[1:22:54] up
[1:22:56] with his children and put them under the
[1:23:02] altar amen amen that's what he did and
[1:23:06] by creating those two
[1:23:10] parts The Fifth
[1:23:12] Dimension and the sixth Dimension is a
[1:23:16] channel is a channel for us when we
[1:23:20] depart either you go down or you go up
[1:23:24] and those that go up they are under the
[1:23:27] altar they comfort from God for he is
[1:23:31] their father God whom you
[1:23:34] worship is the one that came down here
[1:23:38] and
[1:23:40] himself indwell himself amongst
[1:23:44] us amen amen when you
[1:23:47] Worship You Worship in truth you worship
[1:23:51] knowing your
[1:23:53] destination every time he whispers those
[1:23:58] weight in you he always give you the
[1:24:02] direction that is why as a child of God
[1:24:06] we are
[1:24:09] fearless we are no longer scared of
[1:24:12] death if death comes is the one that
[1:24:17] take us back to him taking us back to
[1:24:20] the original position
[1:24:25] we are not
[1:24:26] always amen said amen we we we always
[1:24:31] look up to
[1:24:33] him God gives you another day gives you
[1:24:37] another year you just than thank you if
[1:24:41] he decide to take you say Thank You
[1:24:46] Lord amen amen the most happiest people
[1:24:49] on Earth should be the children of God
[1:24:54] because you know better you know why
[1:24:58] things are happening that way some of
[1:25:01] the things we don't know at that moment
[1:25:05] but beyond that moment we started to see
[1:25:08] things better we started to know things
[1:25:11] better amen amen because he never
[1:25:14] forsaken
[1:25:15] us I was saying it was the last
[1:25:18] scripture but here is my last scripture
[1:25:19] in Acts chapter one because we read the
[1:25:23] one that is taking him down but I want
[1:25:27] to read you the one that is taking him
[1:25:33] up when you read Acts chapter
[1:25:36] one 1 uh verse 2- 4 2 to
[1:25:41] 4 it until the day in which he was taken
[1:25:45] up after that he he threw the Holy Ghost
[1:25:49] had given had given Commandments unto
[1:25:52] the Apostle whom he had chosen
[1:25:55] amen and then you yeah 2 to 4 to whom
[1:25:58] also he showed himself alive after his
[1:26:02] after his H after his Passion by many
[1:26:05] infallible proofs amen being seen of
[1:26:07] them 40 days and speaking of the things
[1:26:10] pertaining to the kingdom of God and
[1:26:12] being assembled together with them and
[1:26:15] commanded them that they should not
[1:26:17] depart from Jerusalem but wait for the
[1:26:19] promise of the Father which sayith he ye
[1:26:23] have had of me amen amen 9 to 10 9 to
[1:26:30] 10 and when he had spoken these things
[1:26:33] while they beheld he was taken up and a
[1:26:36] cloud received him out of their sight
[1:26:39] and what what heaven as he went up
[1:26:42] behold two men stood by them in white
[1:26:46] apparel amen amen you see here I'm just
[1:26:50] trying to show you
[1:26:52] that beyond the grave
[1:26:55] he went down to preach for those people
[1:26:58] that they disbelieve the word of God and
[1:27:01] they will never repent but after three
[1:27:04] days he came and the the people there in
[1:27:08] Jerusalem they started to see the one
[1:27:12] that you know died times
[1:27:14] back for 40 days and then Jesus Christ
[1:27:19] when he Ascend he ascended with them
[1:27:24] the people were looking it was a miracle
[1:27:28] he even said to his disciples the moment
[1:27:31] you see me
[1:27:32] going the very same pattern is the
[1:27:36] pattern that I will come back
[1:27:40] with amen amen for many years passed by
[1:27:45] when many years passed in
[1:27:47] 1963 because he went up with the cloud
[1:27:51] he came back with the
[1:27:52] cloud so we are the witness of them if
[1:27:56] they have
[1:27:57] raptured with the cloud going up the
[1:28:01] cloud came we shall rur in that cloud
[1:28:06] because the cloud from the pyramid and
[1:28:10] the pyramid is the bride being kept by
[1:28:13] our Lord Jesus
[1:28:15] Christ you know when we preach about the
[1:28:18] seven Church
[1:28:19] ages the bride the Seven Seals
[1:28:24] Christ himself coming down his
[1:28:28] church as we are
[1:28:31] one so sooner or later in a twinkle of
[1:28:35] an eye because the constellation is
[1:28:39] complete we will go we walk waiting for
[1:28:42] the Rapture but the time of depart come
[1:28:47] so be it we accept it is the way God
[1:28:53] wants us back home and for us to depart
[1:28:57] is to show the people that those that
[1:29:00] will Rapture will see us up and then we
[1:29:04] go together when a Christian depart is
[1:29:08] not a loss but in God because we rely in
[1:29:13] God but when we are shorted
[1:29:17] shorted even if somebody is greeting you
[1:29:24] you say what shall we say because we
[1:29:26] experience death amen amen we we know
[1:29:29] the pain that we end when someone depart
[1:29:34] but the word of God is there for the
[1:29:39] consolation it should be the one that
[1:29:42] puts you in your position so that
[1:29:46] tomorrow you can comfort as us there are
[1:29:50] certain things that we are going through
[1:29:54] so that other people may learn from
[1:29:57] them what you are going through you be
[1:30:01] able to explain to someone
[1:30:03] tomorrow what you are going
[1:30:06] through what you are going through I
[1:30:09] went through it this is how I overcame
[1:30:13] we should be there for one
[1:30:17] another our God is a good
[1:30:22] planner he he knows
[1:30:25] the other kids you know depart at the
[1:30:29] premature age the other one the elderly
[1:30:34] people the other ones at the middle age
[1:30:38] the other ones their youthful age but
[1:30:41] whom to
[1:30:43] blame amen amen no one to be blamed God
[1:30:47] knows better of what will happen about
[1:30:51] our
[1:30:52] lives the best we are we can do as I was
[1:30:56] always saying as I said
[1:30:59] previously just be a good
[1:31:02] follower just follow God just be a good
[1:31:06] listener just listen to the word of God
[1:31:09] you know when you are living in this
[1:31:13] world amen amen you know when we started
[1:31:17] we start working
[1:31:19] there we we we start with a prayer in
[1:31:21] the morning then they normally ask me to
[1:31:24] pray and when when I pray there's
[1:31:27] something that I mentioned then we are
[1:31:30] with the
[1:31:31] engineers
[1:31:33] managers Le people but I said in my
[1:31:36] prayer Lord God we are here to work and
[1:31:41] our
