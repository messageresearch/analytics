[11:39] our identification
[11:48] from the book Christ is the mystery of
[11:50] God revealed page 21.39
[12:00] then I tend to page 46.
[12:07] paragraph three three five
[12:12] where he says
[12:15] that's the only way you'll know him
[12:18] today
[12:23] I think we all
[12:26] want to know him
[12:29] not just talk about you
[12:34] and now does the prophet speaking
[12:38] that's the only way you'll know him
[12:41] today
[12:44] only way you'll get that threefold
[12:48] revelation of gold
[12:53] so the only way to know him
[12:58] is to get a three-fold revelation of God
[13:04] amen now and there he says we want to
[13:10] find
[13:11] that is Page 21.
[13:15] we want to find out what is this
[13:18] threefold purpose
[13:23] amen
[13:26] now we looking at mark 13.
[13:33] it says
[13:37] of that day
[13:40] and our noeth no man
[13:45] Okay so
[13:47] of that day and the hour no noeth no man
[13:54] now if you tend to join
[13:59] the Book of John 14.
[14:03] there it says at that day
[14:06] you shall know
[14:10] but the 13 Maxes of the of that day
[14:18] already
[14:20] of that day
[14:39] [Music]
[14:41] it falls under one food
[14:46] no one no Angels but the father
[14:51] that's under one fold
[14:55] the father
[14:58] and John says but at that day
[15:04] now not off that day
[15:10] then it says that you shall know
[15:13] [Music]
[15:15] but of that coming day
[15:18] it says
[15:22] no not the angels of heaven
[15:34] but here John says now at that day
[15:39] now you shall know
[15:43] that's one was before the seals were
[15:46] opened
[15:48] the seventh seal
[15:51] and the other one was after it was
[15:55] revealed
[15:58] all right
[16:00] that's what we are looking
[16:03] we are looking at
[16:06] and
[16:09] this part that I was
[16:11] looking at
[16:18] in this book here
[16:21] God bless you
[16:25] um
[16:28] it reached us
[16:33] it says
[16:37] I want
[16:39] to you to notice tonight that in the
[16:44] sixth year
[16:49] there was a three-fold purpose
[16:56] Amen in this in in this
[17:01] a three-fold peoples
[17:06] and the seventh seal also
[17:10] when it was opened
[17:12] it was opened
[17:15] in a three-fold
[17:19] peoples
[17:20] [Music]
[17:21] so that's why he says we want to know
[17:25] what is this threefold people
[17:31] purpose
[17:34] [Music]
[17:38] of the six cells
[17:42] is there another book there please
[17:46] let me read all this
[17:50] so we'll be able to follow amen
[17:56] amen it's all in a six a three-fold
[17:59] purpose
[18:01] now brother Brandon says we want to know
[18:05] what is this threefold pupils
[18:09] okay
[18:11] this is what we are looking at
[18:14] that God bless you all
[18:18] right
[18:19] now
[18:21] we reach this we are going to start with
[18:25] this
[18:27] because that is the only way you will
[18:30] know him
[18:31] [Music]
[18:34] and now
[18:36] here turning down I read also
[18:40] the book of Christ is the mystery of God
[18:45] revealed
[18:53] that's the only way you will know him
[18:58] the only way you will get the only way
[19:02] to know him you will get a threefold
[19:05] revelation
[19:12] and if the prophet says that's the only
[19:15] way that means that's the only way
[19:21] I mean there's no other way
[19:26] to know him except I get a threefold
[19:31] revelation amen
[19:35] now uh he puts it clear here
[19:40] what is this threefold
[19:43] Revelation
[19:47] because even the the seventh seal
[19:52] it says
[19:54] do you notice
[19:55] on the
[19:58] OB seven seal
[20:00] it's it's also in a three-fold mystery
[20:08] in a three-fold
[20:14] is opened
[20:16] in a three-fold mystery the seven seal
[20:20] also
[20:21] that is Page 575 in this version
[20:29] amen do you notice
[20:31] on this opening
[20:34] of this seventh season
[20:38] it's also
[20:40] in a three-fold mystery
[20:46] amen then we realize
[20:51] John 14. tell us what is the threefold
[20:58] mystery
[21:01] amen have you realized as you read it
[21:04] John 14
[21:07] now at that day you know the first one
[21:11] says
[21:12] [Music]
[21:30] at that day you shall know that
[21:37] one
[21:41] the first one said only the father
[21:50] this one says John 14 at that day you
[21:54] shall know
[21:56] that I am in my father
[21:59] and
[22:01] and you in me
[22:04] and I in you
[22:07] threefold amen
[22:09] [Applause]
[22:11] so you are identified
[22:14] with him
[22:16] amen so that is our identity
[22:21] the father
[22:24] hey it's wonderful
[22:27] now he says you shall know
[22:30] and you all know what is to know
[22:33] you should know that
[22:36] he is in the father
[22:40] you
[22:43] in him

[22:48] that he is in the father and you in him
[22:52] and he says
[22:54] [Applause]
[22:57] [Music]
[23:01] amen meaning you are part of the three
[23:06] four
[23:08] and he says you will never know him
[23:12] the only way to know him is he will get
[23:16] a free phone revelation
[23:20] amen isn't he wonderful
[23:25] now page 60 here
[23:28] the same book

[23:44] amen now you have off that day
[23:48] no no no one knows but at that day
[23:54] then you shall know
[23:57] now Jesus said at that day and he says
[24:03] yeah it's this day
[24:06] that means after the revelation of the
[24:09] Seventh Son
[24:10] [Music]
[24:11] is this day amen

[24:21] you read it from your page 60 of Christ
[24:23] is the mystery of God Revenge
[24:28] that day
[24:29] when this Revelation is made known
[24:36] when the Revelation is made
[24:38] then you will know
[24:42] that I am in the father
[24:45] and uh and then
[24:49] you and me and I knew
[24:55] part of the threefolds
[24:58] Revelation
[25:00] amen being identified
[25:04] with him in a three-fold
[25:09] Revelation
[25:11] okay now let me finish this part

[26:10] his church
[26:13] how God

[26:19] right so he says watch then
[26:26] he is the head of the body
[26:30] which is his church Pride
[26:36] then the bright body must follow the
[26:38] head
[26:40] foreign
[26:47] [Music]
[26:52] [Applause]
[27:04] it's
[27:06] impossible for it not to go to go
[27:12] foreign
[27:26] [Applause]
[27:36] [Music]
[27:39] foreign
[27:43] it's one thing in a three-fold
[27:47] and it's called a three-fold revelation
[27:49] of God
[27:51] is the only way you will know him
[27:55] that's when you are part of the
[27:58] threefold
[28:00] that's the only way
[28:03] there's no other way
[28:05] to know apart from being apart
[28:09] of the threefolds
[28:12] amen amen
[28:33] for it is part of his resurrection
[28:39] of his mystery
[28:42] is impossible
[28:45] for it not to go
[28:49] you know brother brand name is you're
[28:51] showing me that day
[28:53] one the bride is so one with him
[28:59] I mean it's even part of him
[29:03] you know we are looking at the family
[29:06] this morning
[29:09] he is the family man
[29:13] and we are part of the family
[29:16] we are not just believers
[29:19] we are part of the family
[29:22] amen he is our King
[29:26] King's Men
[29:28] [Music]
[29:32] amen you know it makes me carry one
[29:36] following
[29:37] we as a member of the family
[29:41] [Music]
[29:42] he Reveals His Church
[29:47] is not just a change it's a revealed one
[29:53] I mean you can find some Churches but
[29:57] this one is a revealed change
[30:01] amen he Reveals His change
[30:05] and raises it up
[30:08] by the same word
[30:11] because he is the word
[30:14] and it's part of his threefold mystery
[30:19] meaning that this church is part of
[30:23] History food
[30:26] which cause he said that that day we
[30:28] shall know
[30:30] that I mean the father
[30:33] and they ruin me
[30:35] and I in you
[30:37] threefold Spirit okay now it says
[30:45] it's part
[30:47] [Music]
[30:52] puts it this way
[30:55] we thank the Lord for that amen
[30:59] and I think it's uh 36 the same
[31:08] I reached this part time and again
[31:13] paragraph
[31:16] 252 page 39 6.
[31:23] his church
[31:26] is himself revealed
[31:32] how
[31:34] how do you hear that brother
[31:39] his church
[31:40] now not a church
[31:42] [Music]
[31:44] but his
[31:46] himself revealed
[31:50] amen when he is revealed
[31:54] it's his church
[31:56] it's him himself
[31:59] revealed
[32:01] he says do you see it and expressed by
[32:05] the word itself
[32:07] that he is
[32:09] and you are part
[32:12] in him
[32:14] that's why
[32:16] everything every Revelation is
[32:20] that is revealed
[32:22] in your soul
[32:24] it is revealed in you
[32:27] [Music]
[32:29] that's why he says
[32:32] we want to find out
[32:35] what is this threefold
[32:39] purpose
[32:44] I'll go back to it again
[32:47] when he opened the seventh seal
[32:52] it was in a threefold
[32:57] that's why
[32:59] if
[33:01] I don't have this three-fold
[33:06] I will miss part of it
[33:11] that's why
[33:13] I will say the seventh is
[33:19] because when it is revealed it is in the
[33:23] three four
[33:24] now three four
[33:26] meaning I'm included
[33:32] so how can it be revealed
[33:48] amen so the only person who will hear
[33:52] that
[33:53] and who will receive it is
[33:59] [Applause]
[34:00] amen amen
[34:03] because it is not for intellectuals
[34:12] it is foolish
[34:14] it is the ministry of the Soul
[34:17] the ministry of the sovereign
[34:34] he says
[34:40] bedtime hearing
[34:45] [Music]
[34:46] that's why you as the member
[34:49] of his body
[34:51] amen amen you can hear
[34:55] what you have said before
[35:00] [Applause]
[35:06] what it says
[35:11] do you understand what I'm looking for
[35:15] right
[35:21] [Music]
[35:28] and our hands have handled over the
[35:31] weight of life
[35:33] okay
[35:34] that which was
[35:36] [Music]
[35:37] from
[35:40] [Music]
[35:42] when I was talking to the Church of God
[35:45] there
[35:45] [Music]
[35:47] that the Bible says
[35:50] yes in the beginning was the way
[35:54] now we all know that God has no
[35:58] beginning
[35:59] God has
[36:03] but it says in the beginning
[36:06] was the word
[36:10] I mean
[36:12] and the Word
[36:14] was with God
[36:18] now you are going backwards
[36:22] beginning was the way
[36:29] the weight was with God
[36:34] and they wrote was
[36:36] God

[37:51] okay
[37:57] when the Bible says
[38:01] amen
[38:14] you know it's not talking about these
[38:17] years
[38:20] it's not this hearing natural

[43:10] [Music]
[43:13] so that when he goes out he will say it

[43:30] tested
[43:32] it works for us
[43:35] so it worked for us that's why we preach

[46:14] I remember looking for a message
[46:19] you know every minister
[46:22] before I I preach
[46:27] I first I have to
[46:31] pray to God
[46:34] it's not just a thing of reading a

[48:32] a person who is not part of the
[48:35] threefold
[48:37] he cannot understand it

[48:44] through the threefold
[48:48] when it is opened

[49:14] that the father don't know
[49:18] because it has to run
[49:22] three things
[49:25] the father that's why he said of Abraham
[49:29] he said to Abraham shall I hide from
[49:32] Abraham
[49:34] the thing that I do
[49:37] Abraham didn't part of him
[49:40] you could not hide from Abraham
[49:44] if he's going to destroy a Sodom we must
[49:48] take up wrong with him
[49:50] well he said I can't hide from Abraham
[49:59] we can't hide anything from us
[50:03] because we are part
[50:06] of him
[50:08] don't you ever we ever think that God
[50:13] will have a separate a secret meeting
[50:17] somewhere
[50:20] without us

[50:33] we are included
[50:35] [Applause]

[51:10] when Abraham separated with Lord
[51:17] the Bible says

[51:24] still you must have it here if you are
[51:27] part of the three four
[51:31] you know that scripture here
[51:34] and that was
[51:37] Abraham
[51:39] and Lord
[51:42] the problem
[51:44] there with Lord
[51:46] the Bible says Lord has his Abraham
[51:51] had his
[51:54] wow what it says yes
[52:01] [Music]
[52:05] and lot also which went with Abraham had
[52:08] flocks and heads and Tents yeah
[52:11] yeah and the land was not able to Bear
[52:14] them that they might dwell together
[52:16] for their substance was great so that
[52:19] they could not dwell together
[52:21] and there was a Strife between the head
[52:24] men of Abrams remember Adam also
[52:30] Adam had
[52:32] Abraham
[52:34] Abraham also he had his
[52:39] answer yes started where it says Abraham
[52:46] from this one
[52:48] and Abraham went out of
[52:50] Egypt he and his wife and all that he
[52:54] had and Lord with him into the South
[52:57] the South and Abram was very rich in
[53:01] cattle in
[53:03] silver and gold and he went on his
[53:06] journey from the south even to Bethel
[53:10] and to the place where he stands had
[53:13] been at the beginning between Bethel and
[53:16] high
[53:17] and to the place of the altar which he
[53:19] had made there at the first and their
[53:23] Abram called on the name of the Lord
[53:25] and Lord also which went with Abram had
[53:29] flocks and heads and Tents and the land
[53:32] was not able to pay them that they might
[53:35] dwell together for their substance was
[53:37] great so that they could not dwell
[53:39] together and there was a Strife between
[53:42] the herdsmen of upbraham's cattle and
[53:45] the herdsmen of Lords cattle and the
[53:48] Canaanites and the parasites dwelled
[53:50] there in the land

[53:55] no strive I pray thee between me and me
[53:58] and between my heads men and thy
[54:01] Health's men for we be brethren is not
[54:04] the whole land before thee separate
[54:07] thyself I pray thee from me now you see
[54:11] where separation is coming from
[54:16] Abraham has his
[54:20] Lord has his
[54:24] it is like in the church
[54:27] God gives the pastor a revelation
[54:31] but you find another ship has also its
[54:35] own revelation
[54:41] amen
[54:43] okay now the thing was Abraham
[54:49] had his
[54:50] Lord also
[54:53] [Music]
[54:56] that's how the people start the church
[54:59] within the church
[55:03] [Music]
[55:04] God has anointed the pastor
[55:07] God has anointed a pastor
[55:10] but there's another one
[55:14] I meant that not but not by God

[55:21] wife until Abraham said hey my friend no
[55:25] no no no no
[55:26] [Music]

[56:13] all right
[56:15] then he said to Lord now if you can't go
[56:19] together with me
[56:20] separate yourself
[56:23] [Music]
[56:26] [Applause]
[56:38] the promised land
[56:43] he was not afraid to say you made the
[56:46] first choice
[56:49] if you choose right I'll choose
[56:52] he knew that he will never choose the
[56:55] promises
[56:57] [Applause]
[57:09] [Applause]
[57:11] yes
[57:15] [Music]
[57:19] foreign

[57:40] a church
[57:43] Lord
[57:46] let us look at the at Lord's choice
[57:52] he he chose
[57:55] a place before it was destroyed
[58:01] huh

[58:07] and lost heating up his eyes and beheld
[58:10] all the pain of Jordan that it was well
[58:13] watered everywhere before the Lord
[58:15] destroyed Sodom and gomon oh
[58:19] that's how the people can choose
[58:26] they choose a place
[58:28] before God destroys him
[58:32] [Applause]
[58:34] mm-hmm
[58:36] Abraham knew that so that's how they
[58:39] separated
[58:40] [Music]
[58:43] and you know until
[58:45] welcome
[58:46] because Abraham was looking for a city
[58:51] [Music]
[58:54] whose maker and Builder
[58:57] is God
[59:00] he didn't just look for a city
[59:03] amen
[59:04] that is he had a supernatural map
[59:10] a city whose maker is God and and the
[59:15] Builder
[59:18] now as he was looking for the city
[59:22] he met the king of that City
[59:27] [Music]
[59:29] amen when he met the king
[59:33] now brother Brandon says a wonderful
[59:36] thing here
[59:38] that the king
[59:41] he gave Abraham what was that
[59:47] Bread and Wine
[59:50] again he says he gave him of himself
[59:54] [Music]
[59:55] foreign
[59:57] [Applause]
[1:00:19] [Applause]
[1:00:30] [Music]
[1:00:31] and you know he says I'm glad in the
[1:00:35] book Hebrews
[1:00:38] I'm glad I met him
[1:00:42] [Applause]
[1:00:44] and he gave me communion
[1:00:49] he says
[1:00:55] [Music]
[1:00:57] now he said who is this
[1:01:04] who was that
[1:01:07] and then
[1:01:11] he said you too should meet you
[1:01:15] now I surprise the brother when I said
[1:01:20] I too as brother Brian
[1:01:29] hey
[1:01:33] brother Brandon says you too
[1:01:38] should meet me
[1:01:41] [Music]
[1:01:44] but the thing is how
[1:01:47] because he says
[1:01:56] [Music]
[1:02:00] [Applause]
[1:02:07] what are you saying now
[1:02:12] when he said
[1:02:15] who is this
[1:02:18] oh yeah
[1:02:20] not that
[1:02:23] who's this
[1:02:26] so if I say to you
[1:02:28] I can't say who is this brother
[1:02:32] if he is not here
[1:02:37] I'll always say who is this brother
[1:02:42] [Applause]
[1:02:48] amen right
[1:02:52] he says the revelation of Melchizedek
[1:02:57] comes into view
[1:03:00] when their seals were opened
[1:03:04] [Music]
[1:03:05] [Applause]
[1:03:08] meaning
[1:03:10] he is the person
[1:03:13] of the being
[1:03:16] of the Seven Seals
[1:03:22] [Applause]
[1:03:29] yeah amen
[1:03:32] became Jesus
[1:03:36] now who is this
[1:03:43] he says
[1:03:45] then he came as
[1:03:49] a prophet
[1:03:54] can you show me Prophet Melchizedek
[1:03:59] have you ever seen prophet
[1:04:02] says he came as as a prophet
[1:04:11] then he says
[1:04:16] then he says to me
[1:04:19] came as a prophet
[1:04:24] now it's easy for me to received because
[1:04:29] he came as a prophet
[1:04:34] amen
[1:04:37] because he says I met him
[1:04:39] he he gave me Bread and Wine
[1:04:44] which is himself
[1:04:47] [Music]
[1:05:04] he says
[1:05:06] except
[1:05:08] You Eat My Flesh and drink my blood you
[1:05:13] have no life
[1:05:18] [Applause]
[1:05:22] he came and said to us except you drove
[1:05:27] my blood and eat my flesh you have that
[1:05:30] is giving of himself
[1:05:33] [Music]
[1:05:35] [Applause]
[1:05:39] that's why
[1:05:41] you know he says he gave Abraham
[1:05:43] of himself
[1:05:48] Abraham was blessed
[1:05:55] this happened
[1:05:57] right at the literal play sport
[1:06:01] foreign
[1:06:05] [Music]
[1:06:19] is another country somewhere no it's
[1:06:23] Jerusalem
[1:06:24] [Music]
[1:06:30] that's why we'll have to look at the
[1:06:32] migration of the
[1:06:36] seed of Abra
[1:06:38] okay
[1:06:39] there's a migration
[1:06:41] of the Seed of Abraham going back home
[1:06:48] I think we have noticed that
[1:06:53] the migration of the Seed of Abraham
[1:06:59] Okay so
[1:07:01] now we'll take we'll look at the Rapture
[1:07:04] in faith
[1:07:07] of what is this rapturing faith
[1:07:11] okay
[1:07:12] but today we are here
[1:07:15] I mean just before we close
[1:07:19] amen now I think we we
[1:07:25] I think we are clear there brother
[1:07:30] when they separated
[1:07:32] one saw a place
[1:07:36] before it was destroyed
[1:07:40] I mean
[1:07:46] and the other one
[1:07:49] the promise
[1:07:52] land
[1:07:54] for God said
[1:07:56] he shall never hide from Abraham
[1:08:01] now we we are the seed of Opera House
[1:08:08] I didn't say the children of Abraham
[1:08:11] [Music]
[1:08:21] who is that none Isaac
[1:08:25] the seed
[1:08:27] Abraham and Sarah had to wait for them
[1:08:36] how did the seat come on
[1:08:40] because the Bible says when the when the
[1:08:44] Three Angels Came
[1:08:48] today to Abraham
[1:08:50] uh what happened there
[1:08:54] they said where is Sarah my wife
[1:08:58] and he said in the tent
[1:09:02] and the Bible says
[1:09:09] I shall return
[1:09:12] according to the time of life
[1:09:15] now he never said wish we shall return
[1:09:20] no I shall return
[1:09:30] when I returned
[1:09:37] so when you
[1:09:40] say because the seeds shall be called in
[1:09:43] Isaac
[1:09:48] that's why
[1:09:53] that scripture
[1:09:58] where it says
[1:10:02] Sarah Sarah
[1:10:05] it was
[1:10:09] it was with Sarah
[1:10:13] past the age
[1:10:18] Isaac came
[1:10:20] after Sarah has passed
[1:10:28] you know the scripture okay
[1:10:36] through faith Sarah also Sarah herself
[1:10:39] receives strength to conceive seed and
[1:10:43] was delivered of a child when she was
[1:10:45] past age amen because she judged him
[1:10:48] faithful who had promised
[1:10:52] and the child was delivered
[1:10:56] when Sarah has passed
[1:10:59] age
[1:11:04] all right
[1:11:06] that's how we so that's how his eye is a
[1:11:11] king
[1:11:14] past the age
[1:11:18] is that right
[1:11:20] you'll see that the Lord Jesus Christ is
[1:11:23] coming in the rapture
[1:11:26] but lucky
[1:11:30] let us look at that
[1:11:34] the rapture
[1:11:37] we look at the Rapture
[1:11:39] the rapturing faith
[1:11:44] without death
[1:11:47] okay
[1:11:50] now that is after ages
[1:11:53] God bless you God bless you
[1:11:57] I can we can read it
[1:12:01] I don't have
[1:12:04] foreign
[1:12:12] [Music]
[1:12:21] I hope I will see this in this book
[1:12:27] God bless you
[1:12:30] Church
[1:12:35] right
[1:12:38] I read this part here
[1:12:45] as he says the lamb took the book
[1:12:49] within himself
[1:12:51] [Music]
[1:12:56] and was the only one who could do it
[1:13:02] he took it from the right hand of him
[1:13:04] that set upon the throne
[1:13:09] that's why he says in you there is a
[1:13:12] throne
[1:13:14] because God operates from a throne to a
[1:13:18] throne
[1:13:19] [Music]
[1:13:22] then he says
[1:13:26] upon the throne to claim his Redemption
[1:13:31] to claim his rights
[1:13:34] to claim for me and you
[1:13:38] that he redeemed us
[1:13:41] back to everything that Adam lost
[1:13:47] in the Garden of Eden
[1:13:50] he has redeemed as back to that amen
[1:13:56] [Music]
[1:13:57] now with the limbo
[1:14:00] this is the book in his hands
[1:14:02] we are ready to ask
[1:14:05] for his grace
[1:14:08] mercy upon us
[1:14:10] to open the seven seal book to us
[1:14:15] and let us look our past
[1:14:19] because
[1:14:20] the curtain of time
[1:14:23] [Applause]
[1:14:33] and let us look our past
[1:14:37] the curtain of time
[1:14:40] all right now here and here he is a a
[1:14:46] mediator on the altar
[1:14:51] just a little
[1:14:55] until there's there's more has to suffer
[1:14:58] like you
[1:15:01] know but this one here okay
[1:15:08] I read this part here
[1:15:11] now watch
[1:15:13] when the last seal is broke
[1:15:17] and when the seventh angel is giving his
[1:15:20] message
[1:15:23] the last trumpet
[1:15:25] shall sound the dead in Christ shall
[1:15:28] rest
[1:15:30] shall rise and which we we which are
[1:15:34] alive and remain shall be caught up
[1:15:38] with with them
[1:15:41] to meet him in the air
[1:15:43] he claims
[1:15:45] he claims he has come forth now to claim
[1:15:49] his possession
[1:15:52] amen
[1:15:54] now this is the thing then we read
[1:15:58] no now watch look at this my bro broke
[1:16:04] the seals
[1:16:06] revealed the mystery
[1:16:09] review them when
[1:16:11] to the last Church age
[1:16:14] the only one that's living
[1:16:19] the rest of them
[1:16:22] are sleeping
[1:16:25] I mean
[1:16:28] this is the last age
[1:16:35] I've got the book here
[1:16:38] the Rapture
[1:16:40] it tells of this last age
[1:16:45] where we are now is the last age
[1:16:54] he is the sleeping
[1:16:56] is the sleeping yeah one they're
[1:16:59] sleeping Church
[1:17:00] in their sixth dimensions
[1:17:04] okay but I think this is what I was
[1:17:07] trying to read to you
[1:17:09] he came for his redeemed subjects
[1:17:14] that means redeemed already
[1:17:19] he comes here at the last seal
[1:17:24] he is no more a mediator
[1:17:30] you know he was a mediator
[1:17:33] but when the seventh is opened
[1:17:36] he is no longer no longer immediate
[1:17:41] why because you are part of him
[1:17:47] during the time
[1:17:50] before the seventh seal was opened the
[1:17:53] seventh he was a mediated
[1:17:57] standing for you but after the seventh
[1:18:01] is opened
[1:18:04] to Human because
[1:18:08] he is with you
[1:18:10] you are with him
[1:18:12] that's why we are that's what we are
[1:18:15] looking at
[1:18:16] the free food
[1:18:18] when you are apart
[1:18:25] no you are part of him
[1:18:28] but before
[1:18:30] he was a mediator when he was still
[1:18:33] battling for us
[1:18:36] I I think I'm looking at this I don't
[1:18:40] know well all right no
[1:18:44] uh in in closing again here we come
[1:18:50] oh my oh these wonderful things
[1:18:53] we've come through that his church is
[1:18:56] himself
[1:18:58] amen and the only way today we can be uh
[1:19:04] today to know him is
[1:19:07] to get the three forward
[1:19:11] but finally I picked this one yeah
[1:19:15] okay
[1:19:17] page 60 I'm back there
[1:19:20] in closing
[1:19:23] Jesus said
[1:19:26] at that day
[1:19:29] now we have passed that one
[1:19:38] but now here we come this one John 14 20
[1:19:43] at that day
[1:19:46] and he says this day
[1:19:52] which day
[1:19:53] [Music]
[1:19:55] this day
[1:19:57] and then he says
[1:20:00] when the Revelation is made known
[1:20:05] you will know that
[1:20:07] I am in their father
[1:20:09] and their father in me and I in you
[1:20:15] through phone Square
[1:20:18] amen when the Revelation is made known
[1:20:23] at that day I read
[1:20:25] you shall know that I'm in I I I'm in
[1:20:30] the father
[1:20:31] and you know when he was with the Jews
[1:20:36] he said I and my father are We Are One
[1:20:43] that is twofold
[1:20:45] because the Gentiles had not come here
[1:20:49] it was not father
[1:20:52] he said I and my father are one to the
[1:20:57] Jews he left up the third part
[1:21:02] I mean because the identures were still
[1:21:06] to come in
[1:21:08] all right you see Bible is a mystery
[1:21:15] I and my father are one
[1:21:18] I am in their father their father is in
[1:21:22] you then when the Revelation comes first
[1:21:26] it's I in you
[1:21:29] [Music]
[1:21:32] it makes it a three
[1:21:35] a three
[1:21:36] a free food
[1:21:40] amen amen
[1:21:43] amen
[1:21:49] that's what the Lord Jesus says
[1:21:51] [Music]
[1:21:53] I'm in the father
[1:21:56] and it continues to say
[1:22:00] yes now it makes a three
[1:22:05] that's why he shall not hide anything
[1:22:09] from you
[1:22:12] and I in you in
[1:22:15] you know brother
[1:22:17] let I in you be I in you
[1:22:25] if we are sons and he says I in you
[1:22:30] really I must say he is in me
[1:22:35] he is in you because if he says I in you
[1:22:40] can you today
[1:22:57] if he opens the seals
[1:23:00] they run through that three phones
[1:23:04] foreign
[1:23:16] but it is open in a three-fold
[1:23:22] isn't he wonderful
[1:23:25] okay
[1:23:26] [Applause]
[1:23:29] we'll come back
[1:23:31] we'll come back he is so wonderful
[1:23:37] amen
[1:23:38] amen the threefold
[1:23:42] they're fed the attack it's you
[1:23:49] in this program
[1:23:51] you are the third part of the threefold
[1:23:56] because he is in you
[1:24:01] amen all right
[1:24:04] so that's that's just that
[1:24:08] when he opens the seal it runs through
[1:24:11] the effect
[1:24:13] it runs through the three pools
[1:24:16] they're threefold
[1:24:20] enough
[1:24:21] and that day
[1:24:23] and he says
[1:24:26] [Music]
[1:24:29] this day
[1:24:33] after the seven seal is revealed
[1:24:41] all right
