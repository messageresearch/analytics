[2:02:21] &gt;&gt; I'm standing here with a grateful heart
[2:02:26] and would like to give thanks to God
[2:02:33] on the 4th of July.
[2:02:38] I received a call from home from
[2:02:43] received a call from
[2:02:48] saying the pastor that is his energy
[2:02:52] levels are very low.
[2:02:58] Then I called a doctor to go check him
[2:03:01] at home.
[2:03:03] After
[2:03:06] we've we've called Dr.
[2:03:12] &gt;&gt; Then he advised that we must um get
[2:03:15] &gt;&gt; we must get a doctor to check him
[2:03:17] brother.
[2:03:21] &gt;&gt; Then when the doctor arrived I was in
[2:03:23] there.
[2:03:26] &gt;&gt; He told him to um call for an ambulance.
[2:03:32] as you could see that the pastor was not
[2:03:34] really well.
[2:03:37] &gt;&gt; Then an ambulance came
[2:03:40] and they took him to the hospital.
[2:03:43] That's where I met him.
[2:03:47] &gt;&gt; He was very swollen. His face was very
[2:03:49] swollen
[2:03:51] [Music]
[2:03:52] and he was admitted.
[2:03:56] So um in the ICU
[2:04:00] [Music]
[2:04:01] um he was admitted in the ICU in the
[2:04:05] critical care unit
[2:04:07] [Music]
[2:04:11] and according to the doctors he was in a
[2:04:13] very bad state
[2:04:18] and the doctors were running around and
[2:04:20] the nurses.
[2:04:25] But what amazed them was that the pastor
[2:04:28] was talking normal
[2:04:32] and
[2:04:34] he was just the same pastor.
[2:04:38] &gt;&gt; Yes. And then there was a cardiologist
[2:04:42] who came
[2:04:46] and she told us that the heart is
[2:04:47] failing
[2:04:51] and the kidneys are failing.
[2:04:55] [Music]
[2:04:57] And he has a severe lung infection
[2:05:02] infection.
[2:05:04] &gt;&gt; And he was connected to all the machines
[2:05:07] you can think of, hospital machines you
[2:05:09] can think of.
[2:05:13] But amazingly, he was talking. He was
[2:05:15] asking about the church.
[2:05:19] [Music]
[2:05:20] [Applause]
[2:05:24] to an extent that there was a do there
[2:05:26] was a nurse who called me
[2:05:33] &gt;&gt; and she told me can you please bring the
[2:05:35] priest books he's looking for rapture
[2:05:37] he's talking about rapture death
[2:05:48] then I went into the word to find out
[2:05:50] what was going on.
[2:05:55] Then he said to me,
[2:05:57] "Jesus is calling me right now."
[2:06:02] &gt;&gt; To an extent that he will pull the
[2:06:04] drips,
[2:06:06] pull them off
[2:06:10] and he'll say,
[2:06:14] &gt;&gt; "Jesus is calling me."
[2:06:16] &gt;&gt; And he started singing.
[2:06:20] our bed
[2:06:26] and he would say, "I'm in a rush to
[2:06:28] heaven now."
[2:06:31] He tried to grab Jesus.
[2:06:34] Jesus is here. Get out. I need to go.
[2:06:40] And then he said, "No." But then there's
[2:06:42] a few people.
[2:06:46] They are holding me back. I need to go
[2:06:47] with them.
[2:06:50] [Applause]
[2:06:55] He said, "Call for me, Pastor Edgar."
[2:07:01] &gt;&gt; And I said, "Pastor Edgar is very far."
[2:07:03] And he said, "He'll be here on the
[2:07:04] 16th."
[2:07:09] &gt;&gt; And I said, "Let me rather call him."
[2:07:12] He said, "No, I want pastor Edgar here."
[2:07:17] And he said, "Pastor Maka also has some
[2:07:19] people that he wants me to to help or
[2:07:23] take with.
[2:07:30] But then I want to go because Jesus is
[2:07:31] calling me.
[2:07:35] I've done my job.
[2:07:38] I've traveled where God wanted me to go.
[2:07:43] I need to go.
[2:07:45] And while I was standing there,
[2:07:48] &gt;&gt; I asked God, God,
[2:07:52] &gt;&gt; I can't tell you what to do or not to
[2:07:53] do,
[2:07:56] &gt;&gt; but just don't take him in front of me.
[2:07:59] Amen.
[2:08:02] &gt;&gt; I said, "Don't take him in front of me."
[2:08:08] Then I called Edar.
[2:08:12] I tried calling pastor
[2:08:18] and then it was on a Sunday that day.
[2:08:22] &gt;&gt; So he's saying you are singing he's
[2:08:25] saying you think
[2:08:28] &gt;&gt; and then on Monday
[2:08:30] the cardiologist cameology
[2:08:33] &gt;&gt; she said the the heart is now failing.
[2:08:38] &gt;&gt; We need to boost
[2:08:44] And the kidney doctor also said, "No,
[2:08:45] it's getting very bad now."
[2:08:50] &gt;&gt; And they called us, um, they called me
[2:08:52] and Qua,
[2:08:54] &gt;&gt; the specialist there, specialist,
[2:08:57] &gt;&gt; he said to us, "You need to go home now,
[2:09:02] prepare for the worst
[2:09:07] because your father won't make it. He's
[2:09:08] going to die.
[2:09:13] Even if he wouldn't die,
[2:09:17] he will never
[2:09:21] be functional again
[2:09:25] because all the vitals are failing now.
[2:09:30] But while he was talking to us,
[2:09:33] I just said to myself
[2:09:36] on Dr. Jesus report. Sorry,
[2:09:39] &gt;&gt; we will wait on Dr. Jesus report
[2:09:43] [Applause]
[2:09:46] and then I'll just fast forward because
[2:09:48] of time
[2:09:51] and then the time came for him to go to
[2:09:54] theater
[2:09:57] because they wanted to see I think it's
[2:09:59] an angel they wanted to find out what is
[2:10:01] happening with the heart.
[2:10:05] The cardiologist came back to say
[2:10:09] &gt;&gt; both arteries are blocked
[2:10:14] &gt;&gt; and they've been blocked for a very long
[2:10:16] time.
[2:10:18] &gt;&gt; I don't even know how this person was
[2:10:20] leaving.
[2:10:24] We don't have a choice
[2:10:27] choice
[2:10:27] &gt;&gt; but we just have to insert I can't
[2:10:29] remember what do they call it's a
[2:10:31] permanent heart booster.
[2:10:37] And the the the specialist for the
[2:10:39] kidneys also told us no the kidneys are
[2:10:42] failing.
[2:10:45] We'll use a permanent booster also.
[2:10:50] &gt;&gt; And they said we need to sign a concern
[2:10:55] for the following day.
[2:11:01] And then on the 22nd of July,
[2:11:06] &gt;&gt; 22 July,

[2:11:27] &gt;&gt; but it was a a very scary moment.
[2:11:33] Then I started singing.
[2:11:39] &gt;&gt; We started singing that.
[2:11:46] Then from there suddenly we heard the
[2:11:48] nurses laughing.
[2:11:52] Then one of the nurses called us
[2:11:55] &gt;&gt; and she said, "Oh, your dad was gone.
[2:12:01] machines were off.
[2:12:04] We tried resuscitating him.
[2:12:07] It didn't work
[2:12:08] &gt;&gt; and we were just we were just thinking
[2:12:10] how we were going to even form you as a
[2:12:12] family.
[2:12:15] Suddenly
[2:12:18] your dad started talking.
[2:12:27] &gt;&gt; And then when we heard that
[2:12:30] I said, "Yeah, God wouldn't allow
[2:12:35] um him to be resuscitated.
[2:12:39] &gt;&gt; He's a giver of life." So,
[2:12:43] &gt;&gt; yes. And then
[2:12:46] &gt;&gt; when um during that same week,
[2:12:50] &gt;&gt; he was supposed to go for the
[2:12:53] for the boosters.
[2:12:57] Then the doctors came
[2:13:00] to say suddenly his organs are working.

[2:13:16] &gt;&gt; They started removing the machines.
[2:13:18] Sorry.
[2:13:19] &gt;&gt; They started removing all the
[2:13:20] connections.
[2:13:24] Then he started breathing on himself
[2:13:28] and the heart started beating.
[2:13:33] Amen.
[2:13:34] &gt;&gt; And the heart started beating on it.
[2:13:38] And the doctor said,
[2:13:40] "We don't know what's happening here.
[2:13:44] Then he's somehow back to normal
[2:13:50] &gt;&gt; and we're going to discharge him."
[2:13:57] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:13:59] &gt;&gt; And then he started walking.

[2:17:11] king are kings themselves.
[2:17:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:14] &gt;&gt; That's why in this end time, Father, we
[2:17:17] are seeing such miracles happening.
[2:17:20] &gt;&gt; Even doctors can't understand. Even
[2:17:23] ourselves can't understand.
[2:17:25] &gt;&gt; But we know it is you.
[2:17:28] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.
[2:17:29] &gt;&gt; Nothing but the blood.
[2:17:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:31] &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord, for the healing of our
[2:17:33] pastor.

[2:17:36] Thank you, Lord, for the weddings. Amen.
[2:17:38] &gt;&gt; We just want to say thank you Lord.

[2:17:46] have given us pastors

[2:17:54] ourselves into that holy hands in Jesus
[2:17:56] name we pray. Amen.
[2:17:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:18:06] Um
[2:18:10] I'm not in a hurry at all.
[2:18:15] &gt;&gt; Uh
[2:18:17] you know sometimes
[2:18:20] &gt;&gt; uh
[2:18:25] the same people who can listen to
[2:18:28] uh this politician talk for 20 minute 20
[2:18:32] hours. I cannot listen to the message of
[2:18:34] God for 15 minutes.
[2:18:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:18:42] &gt;&gt; I will start from very far.
[2:18:46] But uh the message today is
[2:18:49] the the restoration of the bride tree.
[2:18:55] I'll start from a strange book
[2:18:58] for such a message but it's the best
[2:19:03] where to start from.
[2:19:05] First Corinthians
[2:19:08] 1 verse one 1 verse one
[2:19:17] first Corinthians chapter 1 verse one.
[2:19:20] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:19:21] Paul called to be an apostle of Jesus
[2:19:24] Christ through the will of God
[2:19:28] and sooththes our brother. Two
[2:19:32] &gt;&gt; unto the church of God which is at
[2:19:34] Corinth to them that are sanctified
[2:19:39] in Christ Jesus called to be saints with
[2:19:42] all that in every place call upon the
[2:19:45] name of Jesus Christ our Lord both
[2:19:48] theirs and ours.
[2:19:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:50] &gt;&gt; Amen. We can be seated.
[2:19:55] You can just put the scriptures there my
[2:19:57] brother.
[2:20:00] So we have been caught
[2:20:03] in Jesus Christ.
[2:20:06] &gt;&gt; So if I call you to my house,
[2:20:10] the one who is calling
[2:20:13] is the one who has got purpose.
[2:20:16] [Music]
[2:20:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:20:19] &gt;&gt; Amen. If I say come to my house,
[2:20:24] &gt;&gt; I the one who is calling
[2:20:28] and no remove that one first. We'll get
[2:20:31] to that one. The one who is calling
[2:20:35] &gt;&gt; is the one who has got purpose.
[2:20:38] The book of Corinthians says
[2:20:42] we have been called
[2:20:45] to be saints
[2:20:49] who wanted us to be saints.
[2:20:54] The one
[2:20:56] who
[2:20:58] God
[2:21:00] brother sister I cannot be make you a
[2:21:03] saint
[2:21:06] neither can I desentify you.
[2:21:11] Because
[2:21:13] you have been called
[2:21:15] not by me.
[2:21:18] Somebody has called you.
[2:21:21] &gt;&gt; That's Jesus Christ.
[2:21:23] &gt;&gt; So Paul said we have been called
[2:21:28] sanctified in Christ. Sorry.
[2:21:30] &gt;&gt; Sanctified in Christ.
[2:21:32] called.
[2:21:34] He told us,
[2:21:37] "Come, come, come."
[2:21:41] He was calling us, "Whoever wants to be
[2:21:44] a saint,
[2:21:47] come and we have responded.
[2:21:51] Who is making me to be a saint?
[2:21:55] Is it I myself or the one who is
[2:21:58] calling?
[2:22:03] Is your neighbor going to make you a
[2:22:05] saint?
[2:22:09] He He can't even share you money. How
[2:22:11] can he say
[2:22:19] he can't even help you with school fees?
[2:22:21] How can you be sharing this?
[2:22:28] This one is only by God.
[2:22:33] The one who has called us into this.
[2:22:37] &gt;&gt; My brother, my sister,
[2:22:38] &gt;&gt; take it as a very great calling.
[2:22:44] Amen.
[2:22:46] Amen. because
[2:22:49] our caller
[2:22:52] is a true
[2:22:55] to his word.
[2:22:59] Now you should know uh what we're trying
[2:23:03] to talk about today.
[2:23:06] There's a your part
[2:23:09] and there's a part which God has to do.
[2:23:15] Do your part.
[2:23:17] Let God do his part.
[2:23:21] Don't try to do the part of God.
[2:23:27] &gt;&gt; The word has been given to us
[2:23:31] from the book of Genesis
[2:23:35] all the way to the book of Revelation.
[2:23:39] And you find out my brother, my sister,
[2:23:42] the first book,
[2:23:44] which should have been the first book in
[2:23:46] the Bible
[2:23:48] is found in John 1:1.
[2:23:52] That's where the first book is.
[2:23:55] In the beginning was the word. That's
[2:23:58] the first chapter of the Bible.
[2:24:01] But God is a stammer.
[2:24:05] God is a stamaler. like Moses, Moses.
[2:24:10] God is a stammer.
[2:24:13] &gt;&gt; He doesn't speak like that.
[2:24:15] You know, Moses was speaking Hebrew,
[2:24:20] &gt;&gt; but it took Alon
[2:24:22] to translate Hebrew into Hebrew
[2:24:30] because that's the way God speaks.
[2:24:34] And then you find another another
[2:24:38] scripture
[2:24:39] which been which have been in the first
[2:24:41] book
[2:24:44] it's somewhere very far in the middle in
[2:24:46] the book of Isaiah
[2:24:50] that
[2:24:52] how how you have fallen you Lucifer
[2:24:56] that book should have been at the
[2:24:58] beginning
[2:25:00] and you even find in the book of
[2:25:01] revelation
[2:25:03] there was war in heaven
[2:25:08] because in the garden of Eden
[2:25:12] when Adam came
[2:25:14] the Bible is very good doesn't talk
[2:25:17] about the others
[2:25:19] it talks about the arrival of Adam
[2:25:24] how the devil arrived there doesn't tell
[2:25:25] you
[2:25:31] the Bible just talks about the trees
[2:25:34] elephants, the gods,
[2:25:39] and then it says there were two trees,
[2:25:44] the tree of life
[2:25:47] and the tree of knowledge.
[2:25:50] Amen. Amen.
[2:25:51] &gt;&gt; A Bible is a clean book.
[2:25:55] Doesn't talk about dirt things.
[2:25:58] But actually if I can I can I can tell
[2:26:00] you the truth.
[2:26:06] Knowledge
[2:26:07] &gt;&gt; is not about one + one.
[2:26:12] &gt;&gt; Because the Bible says Adam knew his
[2:26:15] wife.
[2:26:20] The tree was a tree of what? The tree.
[2:26:26] But Adam knew his wife.
[2:26:30] So this tree was a tree of that
[2:26:33] knowledge
[2:26:37] not the knowledge which you come we take
[2:26:38] from university of pritori
[2:26:46] was a tree of that knowledge
[2:26:51] &gt;&gt; that is why the whole world
[2:26:55] you go to America you go to anywhere
[2:26:59] You can't sell a car until there's a a
[2:27:02] sexual looking like woman around you.
[2:27:06] You can't even buy buy a bar of soap
[2:27:11] without the knowledge being there.
[2:27:20] &gt;&gt; It was a tree of what?
[2:27:23] Knowledge.
[2:27:25] Unfortunately, you interpreted wrongly.
[2:27:33] Some of you thought it was a a tree of
[2:27:36] A=
[2:27:37] B² + C².
[2:27:48] Then they have they would have told you
[2:27:50] it was a tree of A²= B².
[2:27:58] Amen. Amen.
[2:28:00] &gt;&gt; I believe a lot of you understand me.
[2:28:04] Is anybody doing mric here?
[2:28:07] Those of you who understanding me, raise
[2:28:09] up your hand at a square.
[2:28:15] They understand me correctly.
[2:28:19] So this tree was not for a square= b².
[2:28:26] This was a tree
[2:28:28] that other knowledge
[2:28:31] because
[2:28:33] before they visited that tree
[2:28:36] they didn't have this other knowledge.
[2:28:41] That's why when they visited from this
[2:28:43] tree
[2:28:45] this the knowledge came
[2:28:51] whenever
[2:28:53] went there
[2:28:56] she went to get knowledge
[2:29:02] whenever
[2:29:04] &gt;&gt; was with this tree
[2:29:07] &gt;&gt; she got what
[2:29:09] &gt;&gt; knowledge
[2:29:10] &gt;&gt; that's where Cain
[2:29:12] came from because she visited the tree
[2:29:15] of
[2:29:17] &gt;&gt; knowledge.
[2:29:18] When Adam knew his wife,
[2:29:22] &gt;&gt; there came
[2:29:24] amen.
[2:29:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:29:26] &gt;&gt; The tree of what?
[2:29:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:29:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:29:31] &gt;&gt; Go and check in the dictionary.
[2:29:34] &gt;&gt; Not in the
[2:29:37] check the archaic dictionaries.
[2:29:42] It it will tell you that it was a tree
[2:29:45] of knowledge.
[2:29:47] What does knowledge mean?
[2:29:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:29:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:29:52] &gt;&gt; So when the fruits
[2:29:55] came,
[2:29:57] we talking about the restoration of the
[2:29:58] bright tree.
[2:30:01] These things have been like that from
[2:30:03] the beginning,
[2:30:06] running parallel to one another.
[2:30:10] So the Abel
[2:30:13] &gt;&gt; son of uh son of uh Adam
[2:30:19] &gt;&gt; when it came to him worshiping
[2:30:24] &gt;&gt; he had a revelation
[2:30:27] Cain
[2:30:29] &gt;&gt; didn't have a revelation
[2:30:31] you see there now the next thing
[2:30:35] all the time if you see There are two
[2:30:38] brothers striving one another.
[2:30:44] Don't worry about it.
[2:30:46] Always the wrong
[2:30:50] striving against the good.
[2:30:56] All the time. Be that good brother.
[2:31:05] Don't try to be an angry brother.
[2:31:11] Amen.
[2:31:12] &gt;&gt; It doesn't help you. It doesn't help me.
[2:31:14] It doesn't help everybody.
[2:31:23] &gt;&gt; When uh we come to Ishmael and Isaac,
[2:31:28] you see that
[2:31:30] when it comes to this level
[2:31:39] Hallelujah.
[2:31:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:31:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:31:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:31:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:31:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:31:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:31:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:31:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:31:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:31:46] &gt;&gt; I want to tell you something as well.
[2:31:50] &gt;&gt; Um,
[2:31:54] if you want to look at the trend of
[2:31:56] things
[2:32:02] before Adam came,
[2:32:06] Who was the first one to arrive on
[2:32:07] earth?
[2:32:12] &gt;&gt; According to the book of Isaiah,
[2:32:17] the devil already arrived
[2:32:21] in the house opera of Abraham.
[2:32:25] &gt;&gt; Who was the first one to arrive?
[2:32:30] Ishma. Ishma.
[2:32:32] &gt;&gt; In the house of Adam.
[2:32:34] Who was the first one to arrive?
[2:32:41] We take that
[2:32:42] &gt;&gt; the whole Bible.
[2:32:44] &gt;&gt; I find that always
[2:32:48] the devil is always a step ahead of us.
[2:32:55] Amen. Amen. So the bride tree
[2:32:58] which has come to us
[2:33:01] as according to the book of uh Genesis,
[2:33:06] the bride tree was a fruit tree
[2:33:11] with its own fruits.
[2:33:13] We come to the book of uh uh Acts
[2:33:19] when the bride tree
[2:33:22] Acts 2:38
[2:33:25] &gt;&gt; When the bride tree came
[2:33:28] as a full grown
[2:33:31] tree.
[2:33:35] Amen. Amen. Now
[2:33:39] if you have a if you had a tree
[2:33:42] it has fruits
[2:33:45] sometimes you tend to wonder
[2:33:48] where did the tree disease in the tree
[2:33:50] come from
[2:33:53] you find some of the diseases
[2:33:56] are already inside the seat.
[2:34:02] Hallelujah.
[2:34:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:34:03] &gt;&gt; Because the law of God
[2:34:06] has always been like that.
[2:34:10] So if you come to the book of
[2:34:11] revelation,
[2:34:13] if you come to the revelation 6, my
[2:34:15] brother,
[2:34:17] &gt;&gt; revelation 6,
[2:34:19] revelation 6 uh verse
[2:34:24] verse one, we are talking about the
[2:34:25] destruation of the branch.
[2:34:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:34:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:34:31] &gt;&gt; Revelation chapter 6 verse one.
[2:34:33] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:34:34] And I saw when the lamp opened one of
[2:34:37] the seals, and I heard as it were the
[2:34:40] noise of thunder, one of the four beast
[2:34:43] saying, "Come and see."
[2:34:44] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:34:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:34:46] &gt;&gt; Full stop.
[2:34:48] &gt;&gt; The seal was opened
[2:34:54] &gt;&gt; and a thunder was held.
[2:35:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:35:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:35:01] &gt;&gt; When a seal is open,
[2:35:04] comes
[2:35:06] &gt;&gt; as the message.
[2:35:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:35:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:35:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:35:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:35:11] &gt;&gt; So after that,
[2:35:14] &gt;&gt; what happened?
[2:35:16] &gt;&gt; Verse two.
[2:35:16] &gt;&gt; Verse two.
[2:35:17] &gt;&gt; And I saw and behold a white horse, and
[2:35:20] he that sat on him had a bow, and a
[2:35:23] crown was given unto him, and he went
[2:35:26] forth conquering and to conquer.
[2:35:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:35:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:35:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:35:31] &gt;&gt; So,
[2:35:33] The message
[2:35:35] &gt;&gt; which is contained in the seal
[2:35:41] &gt;&gt; which you have heard.
[2:35:44] &gt;&gt; Remember
[2:35:46] John heard
[2:35:49] you are you also have heard the message.
[2:35:53] After you have heard the message,
[2:35:56] that's when you can see the other part.
[2:36:02] It was after Abel had heard the message
[2:36:04] from his father.
[2:36:07] [Music]
[2:36:09] That's when he knew
[2:36:11] pumpkins and leaves and what and cannot
[2:36:14] be offered for sacrifice.
[2:36:19] [Music]
[2:36:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Now the book the way
[2:36:25] the Bible is written
[2:36:27] you find that the white horse rider
[2:36:32] and uh he's a white horse rider
[2:36:36] but if
[2:36:39] the seven se is not open to you
[2:36:44] you'll be lost
[2:36:46] because
[2:36:48] the white horse rider
[2:36:51] you have to go back
[2:36:54] to the book of the seven church ages
[2:36:58] to know who is a white horse rider
[2:37:04] which you'll find out
[2:37:06] that is none other than people holding
[2:37:09] the deeds of the neglectants
[2:37:16] those were the people which were the
[2:37:19] first uh horse riders
[2:37:26] Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:37:27] &gt;&gt; Now you have to go back
[2:37:30] to the book of Joel.
[2:37:33] &gt;&gt; That's where you know
[2:37:36] that the
[2:37:37] necroans
[2:37:40] are a
[2:37:46] just write it down. You're going to find
[2:37:47] it out like that.
[2:37:50] Amen.
[2:37:51] What does the palmer do?
[2:37:54] &gt;&gt; It eats the fruits.
[2:37:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:37:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:37:59] &gt;&gt; Yes. Yeah. Just leave it there so that
[2:38:02] people can can can be reading it with
[2:38:03] me.
[2:38:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:38:04] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So if you go to Joel
[2:38:07] &gt;&gt; is no longer a white horse
[2:38:10] &gt;&gt; is a pawm.
[2:38:16] So the palm
[2:38:18] was there to get out the fruits.
[2:38:24] So God sent the beast
[2:38:28] power to meet these people.
[2:38:32] It was in the preaching. It was in the
[2:38:35] preaching.
[2:38:37] Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:38:39] So this palm
[2:38:42] started eating the fruits
[2:38:45] in the church of Ephesians
[2:38:48] in the church of
[2:38:51] all the way to pilg
[2:38:56] on 325 A 325 A you find it
[2:39:02] &gt;&gt; in the third book
[2:39:07] but yet it is still in the first seal
[2:39:11] but that a crown is given
[2:39:15] who was given a crown.
[2:39:19] Remember in the Ephesians
[2:39:22] it was about deeds
[2:39:24] but when it came to
[2:39:28] it was a doctrine.
[2:39:30] What type of doctrine was it?
[2:39:34] Amen.
[2:39:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:39:35] &gt;&gt; Bring it there.
[2:39:37] Let's see this. What type of doctrine
[2:39:38] was it?
[2:39:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:39:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:39:44] &gt;&gt; Give me the uh the uh
[2:39:50] uh revelation chapter 2.
[2:39:57] Give me the pamos church h it's around
[2:40:01] verse 15. I believe
[2:40:04] &gt;&gt; from verse 12. I wait let me just cross
[2:40:08] check.
[2:40:13] &gt;&gt; Yes. Go down a little bit. I I just want
[2:40:15] to come to where the the doctrine is.
[2:40:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:40:18] &gt;&gt; Come down where there's a doctrine of
[2:40:21] Balac. Amen. There we go.
[2:40:25] You see
[2:40:26] &gt;&gt; that's actually the first seal
[2:40:30] &gt;&gt; the doctrine of Balam
[2:40:35] who taught.
[2:40:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:40:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:40:39] &gt;&gt; What was the doctrine
[2:40:42] of Balam
[2:40:43] &gt;&gt; was changing money
[2:40:47] for prayer.
[2:40:52] What happened at Council?
[2:40:56] The church was sold
[2:41:00] the way Balam sold the Balam sold the
[2:41:03] church.
[2:41:06] Go and read.
[2:41:09] &gt;&gt; Brother Abraham says
[2:41:11] &gt;&gt; Constantine
[2:41:12] &gt;&gt; Constantine
[2:41:13] &gt;&gt; gave the marble uh marble pits
[2:41:19] houses and money. Which prophet
[2:41:24] in the Bible was selling his gift?
[2:41:30] Who?
[2:41:32] So who is Balac
[2:41:34] was Constantine?
[2:41:37] Constantine. Constantine Constantine
[2:41:41] &gt;&gt; knew from the beginning
[2:41:44] but that the brothers who had gone to
[2:41:45] Nessia Council
[2:41:48] were not the correct believers
[2:41:52] because go and read Josephus.
[2:41:55] He said, "Josephus,
[2:41:58] the brothers which went to this council
[2:42:01] even falsified the documents
[2:42:06] to make their deacons to make their
[2:42:08] deacons look as if they were pastors.
[2:42:13] Constantine knew
[2:42:15] they were looking for money.
[2:42:19] Constantine knew the real church is not
[2:42:22] here.
[2:42:24] aim was to divide and rule.
[2:42:31] Every church of God
[2:42:34] is supposed to guard against dividing
[2:42:36] and ruling.
[2:42:43] So what happened?
[2:42:45] We see that the the church
[2:42:48] was there. Constantine says, "Ah, you
[2:42:52] know, you know you people
[2:42:55] the problem which you have
[2:42:58] you don't have a leader.
[2:43:01] So choose one of you
[2:43:04] to become a leader and to be the pope.
[2:43:09] &gt;&gt; So that's why the Bible says
[2:43:12] a crown was
[2:43:15] was given.
[2:43:19] Have you seen the
[2:43:22] where the crown given
[2:43:28] &gt;&gt; where a crown was given?
[2:43:32] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:43:33] &gt;&gt; Where the church was sold.
[2:43:38] &gt;&gt; That's why it's a doctrine
[2:43:41] of
[2:43:45] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:43:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:43:46] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:43:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[2:43:50] Amen. Amen. We are finished with the
[2:43:52] doctrine of Balam.
[2:43:54] Doctrine of Balam when he comes is
[2:43:57] looking for money.
[2:44:00] And the one who gives the money
[2:44:02] is
[2:44:07] &gt;&gt; in the seals.
[2:44:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:44:10] &gt;&gt; Amen. So where the sea was talking about
[2:44:16] a sword being given
[2:44:20] &gt;&gt; that's revelation 6 3 and 4 3 and 4.
[2:44:25] &gt;&gt; Let's look at that that one
[2:44:29] in the seals.
[2:44:34] and my brother.
[2:44:35] &gt;&gt; Revelation 6:3.
[2:44:38] And when he had opened the second seal,
[2:44:41] I heard the second beast say, "Come and
[2:44:44] see."
[2:44:45] And there went out another horse that
[2:44:48] was read, and power was given unto him
[2:44:50] that set there on to take peace from the
[2:44:53] earth, and that they should kill one
[2:44:55] another. And there was given unto him a
[2:44:58] great sword.
[2:44:59] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:45:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:45:01] &gt;&gt; So where was the sword given?
[2:45:06] You go back,
[2:45:08] where is it
[2:45:11] in the church ages
[2:45:14] where this happened?
[2:45:18] You go to the church of theater.
[2:45:25] Amen. Amen. That's where you find that
[2:45:28] the uh the the angel
[2:45:32] is talking to John
[2:45:34] about the woman Jezebel
[2:45:40] taking control.
[2:45:42] Jezebel
[2:45:44] &gt;&gt; her main duty
[2:45:48] is always killing.
[2:45:52] Even if he wants a vineyard
[2:45:57] one day was very sad,
[2:46:01] &gt;&gt; I want that field for that brother.
[2:46:06] just says just wait
[2:46:10] and so and so can I can you accuse that
[2:46:13] brother of doing this
[2:46:15] [Music]
[2:46:20] and they kill him I come to the husband
[2:46:23] go and take the field because that
[2:46:24] person
[2:46:27] is gone
[2:46:32] hallelujah amen you find that in the
[2:46:34] second seal
[2:46:38] God brought the uh spirit of an ox
[2:46:42] to fight Jezebel.
[2:46:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:46:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:46:48] &gt;&gt; Maybe let's read. We shouldn't be in a
[2:46:51] rush.
[2:46:52] &gt;&gt; Revelation chapter 2 or three. I have
[2:46:56] the scriptures here. Unfortunately, my
[2:46:59] eyes are not helping me at all at at
[2:47:02] all.
[2:47:03] This
[2:47:05] Go to Revelation chapter 2. My brother
[2:47:07] chapter just find where the church
[2:47:10] church
[2:47:15] &gt;&gt; uh chapter 2 or chapter 3
[2:47:17] &gt;&gt; chapter 2 verse 18.
[2:47:18] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:47:20] &gt;&gt; And unto the church of unto the angel of
[2:47:23] the church in Thotira, write these
[2:47:25] things said the son of God who have his
[2:47:28] eyes like unto a flame of fire.
[2:47:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:47:31] &gt;&gt; And his feet are like fine brass. Yes,
[2:47:34] &gt;&gt; I know thy works and charity and service
[2:47:38] and faith and thy patience and thy works
[2:47:41] and the last to be more than the first.
[2:47:46] Notwithstanding, I have a few things
[2:47:48] against thee, because thou sufferest
[2:47:50] that woman Jezebel,
[2:47:52] &gt;&gt; which calleth herself a prophetist.
[2:47:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:47:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:47:56] &gt;&gt; Jezebel.
[2:47:56] &gt;&gt; Jezebel. the Catholic religion.
[2:48:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:48:06] &gt;&gt; I was supposed to have Rita today. Is
[2:48:08] Risa here? She hasn't arrived.
[2:48:12] She hasn't arrived. Okay.
[2:48:15] Risa. Yeah. God bless you. You need to
[2:48:18] come in front here.
[2:48:20] Come and sit here. You should be
[2:48:22] singing.
[2:48:25] Come.
[2:48:29] Amen. She's here. This is my daughter.
[2:48:31] &gt;&gt; Oh, she uh
[2:48:36] something good is happening.
[2:48:40] &gt;&gt; Amen. She's she's a daughter of my
[2:48:42] friend. Every time when I come here
[2:48:47] in South Africa,
[2:48:48] &gt;&gt; I stay at my friend's house
[2:48:52] and that's the daughter.
[2:48:54] &gt;&gt; And uh
[2:48:56] uh strangely she said, "I want to go to
[2:49:00] your church."
[2:49:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:49:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:49:09] &gt;&gt; Thank you for coming, Luther.
[2:49:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:49:15] &gt;&gt; Uh I've known her since she was she's a
[2:49:19] friend my friend daughter.
[2:49:22] &gt;&gt; She wanted to be here
[2:49:25] &gt;&gt; because
[2:49:27] um
[2:49:28] sister do and believe were together at
[2:49:33] the wedding there. So the way she saw
[2:49:35] them says no I want to go to a church.
[2:49:42] God bless you mama.
[2:49:45] Amen.
[2:49:48] So today she was very fine in Ellensburg
[2:49:50] in Johansburg there. She gave problems.
[2:49:53] I want to come to church. I want to come
[2:49:54] to church. I want to come
[2:49:57] until we had to Uber her all the way to
[2:50:00] here.
[2:50:03] Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:50:05] &gt;&gt; Let's continue. So Jezebel is the
[2:50:08] Catholic church.
[2:50:11] When was Jezebel
[2:50:13] the ruler of the world?
[2:50:16] &gt;&gt; It was during the church of the
[2:50:18] disposition of Theater.
[2:50:22] What happened
[2:50:24] in that time when Jezebel was ruling?
[2:50:29] &gt;&gt; Because she was Jezebel.
[2:50:32] What? What is the speed of Jezebel?
[2:50:36] is what
[2:50:38] killing
[2:50:39] that's why the great sword was given
[2:50:43] and if you come into the message of the
[2:50:45] hour
[2:50:47] you hear that the August St. Augustine
[2:50:50] of
[2:50:53] in 354 AD
[2:50:56] 354 you can just search that one my
[2:50:57] brother you'll find it
[2:51:00] said
[2:51:01] &gt;&gt; it is even good to kill those people
[2:51:06] who disagreed with the teaching of the
[2:51:07] Roman Catholic Church.
[2:51:13] &gt;&gt; What was that? That was a sword
[2:51:17] being given.
[2:51:22] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:51:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:51:23] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:51:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:51:25] So the first one of the worms of Joel
[2:51:33] was a palmer.
[2:51:35] &gt;&gt; What does a palmer do?
[2:51:38] &gt;&gt; It eats the fruits.
[2:51:41] &gt;&gt; What are the fruits?
[2:51:43] &gt;&gt; Joy, love,
[2:51:46] &gt;&gt; peace.
[2:51:47] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:51:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:51:48] &gt;&gt; So it eats the fruit.
[2:51:52] &gt;&gt; When it come to the second realm,
[2:51:57] which is the locust.
[2:52:00] What does it eat?
[2:52:02] It eats the leaves.
[2:52:05] What does the leaves stand for?
[2:52:08] Fellowship.
[2:52:10] So when Jezebel
[2:52:12] came with a sword killing people,
[2:52:16] fellowship was stopped.
[2:52:21] That's when people went into the
[2:52:22] catacombs.
[2:52:25] That's when people dispersed.
[2:52:28] What was the worm of that time?
[2:52:32] Locus
[2:52:35] dysfellowshipping people.
[2:52:39] Hallelujah. Amen. So when it is coming
[2:52:42] to that point,
[2:52:44] God sends the beasts
[2:52:48] to fight this. These were people who
[2:52:50] could just let Jezebel do everything
[2:52:52] what he want.
[2:52:57] God shall never have a time
[2:53:01] which he doesn't have a worshipper.
[2:53:04] [Music]
[2:53:06] Amen. Every time because of whatever can
[2:53:09] happen
[2:53:10] there will always be a true worship.
[2:53:17] Amen. Amen.
[2:53:25] If you can look at in the book of Moses,
[2:53:29] Janice and Jambre,
[2:53:31] &gt;&gt; they came to impersonate Moses.
[2:53:36] Who was there first?
[2:53:40] Janice and Jambre.
[2:53:43] &gt;&gt; I don't know my brother when that
[2:53:45] competition came.
[2:53:49] Moses throws a stick. It is a snake.
[2:53:54] &gt;&gt; And
[2:53:55] throw their sticks, their snakes.
[2:54:00] You know this witchcraft thing they
[2:54:02] learn from family to family to family
[2:54:05] generations.
[2:54:09] So
[2:54:11] the snake h the snake of Moses
[2:54:15] ate all those roots. Those
[2:54:19] people when they were going home they
[2:54:20] had a lot to explain
[2:54:25] because their children were asking
[2:54:26] where's our where's our stick.
[2:54:33] The wives were asking papa where's our
[2:54:36] stickes
[2:54:41] it has gone.
[2:54:44] &gt;&gt; Do you think they will like Moses for
[2:54:45] that?
[2:54:49] They lost a lot that day.
[2:54:52] Those those sticks were doing a lot for
[2:54:54] them.
[2:54:58] I hope no one maybe one of them was able
[2:55:01] to walk without the stick.
[2:55:06] That day I start struggle to get home
[2:55:08] because the stick was gone.
[2:55:15] &gt;&gt; Because God will always send
[2:55:20] a spirit to counteract
[2:55:25] everything you meet at work.
[2:55:30] Let one of your workmates start doing
[2:55:33] things against you
[2:55:38] and see what God will do to that
[2:55:42] [Music]
[2:55:43] because that's the way God does.
[2:55:47] God will always send the spirit
[2:55:50] for the specific this season.
[2:55:56] Amen. Amen. So when it came to the
[2:56:00] when it came to the spirit of u
[2:56:04] deception
[2:56:06] where the uh the devil started selling
[2:56:09] salvation
[2:56:12] sorry when the devil starts selling
[2:56:14] salvation
[2:56:17] that that was under the third seal
[2:56:21] send a spit of a man
[2:56:24] to counter like that
[2:56:26] they just shall live by faith.
[2:56:30] The devil lost again.
[2:56:33] He's always a loser.
[2:56:38] When it came to the last age,
[2:56:40] the devil mixed.
[2:56:45] God sent an eagle
[2:56:48] to go very high.
[2:56:52] Hallelujah.
[2:56:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:56:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:56:57] Hallelujah.
[2:56:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:56:58] &gt;&gt; You know an ego
[2:57:01] &gt;&gt; is born different.
[2:57:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:57:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:57:10] &gt;&gt; Um
[2:57:11] every one of those animals which are
[2:57:13] before they all they lie on
[2:57:21] those are all breastfeeding animals.
[2:57:28] And if there are doctors here, they'll
[2:57:29] tell you
[2:57:32] there's there's disease in the breast
[2:57:34] milk.
[2:57:40] You get diseases
[2:57:43] &gt;&gt; because you're breastfeeding.
[2:57:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:57:50] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:57:53] disease of the mother gets into you
[2:57:58] because of breastfeeding.
[2:58:03] All those animals before that
[2:58:08] they got cord
[2:58:11] attached to the mother.
[2:58:18] The doctors will tell you so many
[2:58:21] diseases come from the mother to the
[2:58:23] baby
[2:58:26] through the
[2:58:32] doctors. So
[2:58:38] they they say so.
[2:58:38] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:58:40] The doctor says
[2:58:45] &gt;&gt; the thing which makes you grow
[2:58:48] has got diseases as well coming.
[2:58:51] &gt;&gt; But when we are born an ego,
[2:58:54] &gt;&gt; you are born independently
[2:58:58] independent.
[2:59:00] Amen.
[2:59:04] &gt;&gt; Okay. Sometimes you can be born as a B.
[2:59:11] But uh being bled as a bell doesn't make
[2:59:13] you an eagle.
[2:59:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:59:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:59:22] &gt;&gt; You know these other birds are very
[2:59:23] dirty birds.
[2:59:30] The mother goes to eat food somewhere.
[2:59:33] It eats eats.
[2:59:37] When it comes to the next day,
[2:59:40] &gt;&gt; starts vomiting into your mouth.
[2:59:50] That's the way the other teach their
[2:59:52] children.
[2:59:54] They make them eat vomit.
[2:59:59] But an eagle, the mother goes to kill an
[3:00:03] animal.
[3:00:07] brings it to the child.
[3:00:09] The child eats on its own.
[3:00:17] The mother begs,
[3:00:20] eats. The young one begs
[3:00:24] and eats. They eat from the same animal
[3:00:27] at the same time.
[3:00:33] Fresh meat.
[3:00:36] not vomited meat.
[3:00:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:00:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:00:43] &gt;&gt; So as an eagle,
[3:00:45] &gt;&gt; you are so boundless,
[3:00:50] you are an animal of cleanliness.
[3:00:56] Hallelujah. Amen.
[3:00:57] &gt;&gt; Now when it comes to us,
[3:01:00] &gt;&gt; we are not just a normal build.
[3:01:04] And
[3:01:06] we are eager.
[3:01:19] There are so many people here who wants
[3:01:20] to vomit this to this one, vomit this to
[3:01:23] vomit this. Don't do that.
[3:01:28] Get yourself fresh.
[3:01:33] Fresh.
[3:01:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:01:38] &gt;&gt; You are an eagle
[3:01:39] &gt;&gt; and you can fly.
[3:01:46] &gt;&gt; Sky is not a limit for you.
[3:01:54] It can be raining here in Pritoria.
[3:01:58] You just go above the rain.
[3:02:03] Yeah, I just go be
[3:02:05] fly above.
[3:02:11] &gt;&gt; You are an eagle.
[3:02:13] &gt;&gt; You are supposed to fry above your poor
[3:02:15] bread.
[3:02:21] Amen.
[3:02:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:02:28] So you can see that the book of
[3:02:31] revelation
[3:02:33] you cannot read it
[3:02:35] until you read the book of uh you cannot
[3:02:38] look the you cannot read the seven seals
[3:02:42] because the seals are in the seven
[3:02:45] church ages.
[3:02:48] The seven church ages are in the book of
[3:02:50] Joel.
[3:02:52] The seals are in the book of Daniel. So
[3:02:55] if you have to read all this,
[3:02:59] can you eat through vomit?
[3:03:02] No, you have you have to pick it
[3:03:04] yourself
[3:03:08] together.
[3:03:10] Then you will see what Isaiah was
[3:03:12] speaking
[3:03:15] was the seven seals. What was there in
[3:03:17] the book of Genesis
[3:03:21] was in the seal.
[3:03:25] And some people start hating you for
[3:03:27] talking about seals too much.
[3:03:29] [Music]
[3:03:30] Which which Bible doesn't have seals?
[3:03:38] Because
[3:03:39] &gt;&gt; even if I can lead you,
[3:03:41] &gt;&gt; okay, let me just talk about the birth
[3:03:42] of Jesus
[3:03:47] is in the se
[3:03:51] because if you go to Revelation 12,
[3:03:57] it what does it say? Go there, my
[3:03:59] brother.
[3:04:06] Revelation 12:2.
[3:04:08] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[3:04:10] &gt;&gt; And she being with child cried
[3:04:12] travailing in birth and pain to be
[3:04:15] delivered.
[3:04:18] &gt;&gt; Mhm.
[3:04:19] &gt;&gt; And there appeared another wonder in
[3:04:21] heaven. And behold, a great red dragon
[3:04:24] having seven heads and 10 horns and
[3:04:26] seven crowns upon his heads.
[3:04:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:04:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:04:30] &gt;&gt; You are believers. Who is that one?
[3:04:36] &gt;&gt; No, no, no. Who? Who has got seven
[3:04:39] heads, 10 horns, seven crowns? Who is
[3:04:41] that one?
[3:04:44] [Music]
[3:04:47] &gt;&gt; That's none other than Rome.
[3:04:51] When Jesus was being born,
[3:04:56] when Jesus was being born,
[3:04:59] that is the time which the Roman Empire
[3:05:05] was ruled by the most brilliant Caesar.
[3:05:14] A lot of people make a mistake.
[3:05:16] They think
[3:05:18] Julius Caesar was the greatest.
[3:05:22] Julius was not the greatest.
[3:05:25] &gt;&gt; The greatest was his nephew
[3:05:28] [Music]
[3:05:30] Augustus.
[3:05:31] &gt;&gt; Augustus
[3:05:32] that by the time Jesus was being born,
[3:05:37] the dragon
[3:05:39] &gt;&gt; had his head ready,
[3:05:43] which was Augustus Caesar. Augustus
[3:05:46] Caesar. If you can go to the book of
[3:05:48] Daniel,
[3:05:50] you will find that it says this power
[3:05:55] has got power to change deaths.
[3:06:01] Which of the emperors
[3:06:04] emperor
[3:06:05] &gt;&gt; who was able to change deaths up to now?
[3:06:08] &gt;&gt; Days.
[3:06:09] &gt;&gt; Yeah. The same days like Monday,
[3:06:11] Tuesday.
[3:06:14] Who Who was that? Who was that one?
[3:06:16] other than
[3:06:18] &gt;&gt; Augustus.
[3:06:19] &gt;&gt; Austo.
[3:06:21] &gt;&gt; That is why him being Augustus,
[3:06:25] &gt;&gt; he gave the month of August 31 days.
[3:06:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. His uncle is Julius
[3:06:37] &gt;&gt; and his mother's Julia.
[3:06:41] &gt;&gt; July 31 days.
[3:06:42] &gt;&gt; July 31.
[3:06:47] him was an Octavian
[3:06:52] October 31 days.
[3:06:58] &gt;&gt; He is the one who made use the modern
[3:07:00] calendar.
[3:07:05] How was he prepared to kill Jesus?
[3:07:09] At birth,
[3:07:12] at birth, Jesus wouldn't have survived.
[3:07:17] The very same time Jesus was supposed to
[3:07:19] be born,
[3:07:22] Augustus declares,
[3:07:27] everyone has to go back to their home
[3:07:29] village.
[3:07:30] [Music]
[3:07:35] and Mary
[3:07:37] &gt;&gt; and Joseph
[3:07:39] started going when the woman was already
[3:07:41] in tra
[3:07:47] they arrived. The woman was in tra.
[3:07:52] They asked for a for a place
[3:07:56] for the puppet to be born.
[3:07:58] All the doors were closed.
[3:08:02] Amen. Amen. And if they are okay the
[3:08:06] doctors which are here are going to tell
[3:08:08] you something
[3:08:10] before the mother the baby is born
[3:08:13] they start giving you shots for tetanus
[3:08:17] injection
[3:08:19] they do that here I don't know whether
[3:08:21] they do it but it should be done even
[3:08:22] here
[3:08:24] because it's one of the injections which
[3:08:25] the mother has to get before the baby is
[3:08:27] born
[3:08:30] to protect the baby from tetanus
[3:08:35] Where does Satan has come from? From
[3:08:41] &gt;&gt; of animals. The d of animals.
[3:08:45] &gt;&gt; Jesus
[3:08:46] went into the cowan.
[3:08:51] He was born in there at the home of
[3:08:54] tetanus
[3:08:57] by a mother who has never been delivered
[3:08:59] before.
[3:09:02] and he survived.
[3:09:05] Amen.
[3:09:09] &gt;&gt; They'll tell you if you are pricricked
[3:09:12] by a dirt and nail.
[3:09:17] &gt;&gt; Yes. They they they have to give you uh
[3:09:21] they have to give you a ton short
[3:09:26] because it's dirty.
[3:09:29] Jesus was given the most dirty cross
[3:09:34] which they put on the
[3:09:36] which they put on the neck of an animal
[3:09:41] that was full of tetanus.
[3:09:45] They loved him in there.
[3:09:50] The devil was very very to kill Jesus at
[3:09:52] birth
[3:09:56] but he survived.
[3:10:00] What is your fear now?
[3:10:05] &gt;&gt; Can anybody kill you?
[3:10:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:10:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:10:10] &gt;&gt; My brother, my sister,
[3:10:12] &gt;&gt; your life is the seven seals themselves.

[3:10:58] The seven seals
[3:11:00] &gt;&gt; are open to us.
[3:11:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:11:09] &gt;&gt; I wanted sister to give you the
[3:11:11] testimony.
[3:11:17] &gt;&gt; I arrived at the hospital there
[3:11:21] seeing how many machines were connected
[3:11:23] to the pastor. Yesterday
[3:11:30] &gt;&gt; we were dancing.
[3:11:33] [Applause]
[3:11:39] &gt;&gt; They didn't show you the the picture
[3:11:40] which we were dancing.
[3:11:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:11:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:11:46] &gt;&gt; I couldn't try. I I couldn't do most
[3:11:48] other than to cry because
[3:11:52] &gt;&gt; God is doing miracles.
[3:11:59] Each and every one of us
[3:12:04] has got access to these things
[3:12:14] because the bride tree
[3:12:18] has been restored.
[3:12:22] Amen.
[3:12:25] All the seals
[3:12:27] have been given back to you.
[3:12:32] &gt;&gt; The seals are no longer in the Bible.
[3:12:37] &gt;&gt; You are the seals.
[3:12:41] Amen.
[3:12:43] My brother,
[3:12:45] &gt;&gt; find me where brother says
[3:12:50] he is those seals.
[3:12:57] &gt;&gt; Where is Christ today?
[3:13:01] Where is he? Here.
[3:13:05] Where are the seals?
[3:13:07] &gt;&gt; Here are the seals.
[3:13:12] You are the seals, my brother.
[3:13:15] Let everybody else be whatever they want
[3:13:16] to be.
[3:13:21] &gt;&gt; You are the seals.
[3:13:25] What the web ate,
[3:13:29] it has been restored.
[3:13:31] What the locust ate,
[3:13:34] &gt;&gt; it has been restored.
[3:13:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:13:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. Everything about us,
[3:13:41] &gt;&gt; the realm,
[3:13:43] &gt;&gt; the caterpillar,
[3:13:45] &gt;&gt; it has been restored.
[3:13:49] &gt;&gt; Is a God of restoration.
[3:13:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:13:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:14:04] uh you know the
[3:14:06] the
[3:14:11] in every country
[3:14:13] because they always copy what God does
[3:14:20] in every country
[3:14:22] there's a state house
[3:14:27] I don't I don't know where the state
[3:14:28] house is in South Africa.
[3:14:33] Amen. Amen.
[3:14:34] &gt;&gt; For those of you who are lawyers,
[3:14:38] big lawyers.
[3:14:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:14:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:14:43] &gt;&gt; Sometimes you should ask,
[3:14:46] where did where was the president when
[3:14:48] he was signing this?
[3:14:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:14:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because if he was at his
[3:14:58] uh lodge or at his farm
[3:15:04] and he signed a document for you
[3:15:08] if I was clever enough,
[3:15:11] I'll tell them that document is useless
[3:15:20] &gt;&gt; because
[3:15:22] any document which is very useful.
[3:15:28] If the if the president is going to send
[3:15:29] me to death,
[3:15:34] he has to be on his chair at the state
[3:15:37] house
[3:15:39] because that's the only that's the only
[3:15:42] chair he can use to sign anything which
[3:15:44] is useful.
[3:15:48] Those of you who sees Donald Trump, you
[3:15:50] find every time he's in the off office
[3:15:51] signing the
[3:15:55] whatever he signs is nothing,
[3:15:59] &gt;&gt; he cannot be at his lodge and signing
[3:16:01] his document.
[3:16:04] When he wants to do anything,
[3:16:07] &gt;&gt; yes. Amen.
[3:16:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:16:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:16:15] What is the opening of the seals
[3:16:20] &gt;&gt; revealing?
[3:16:26] Amen.
[3:16:27] &gt;&gt; What is the opening of the seals?
[3:16:34] &gt;&gt; What is the opening of the seals?
[3:16:38] Revealing Christ.
[3:16:44] Who is revealing Christ at the
[3:16:49] University of Pritoria?
[3:17:00] a long dress
[3:17:05] because everybody else
[3:17:07] &gt;&gt; he'll be moving around with a tree of
[3:17:09] knowledge.
[3:17:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:17:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:17:17] &gt;&gt; So you are the Christ
[3:17:24] of Christ.
[3:17:28] So now when I am the ambassador
[3:17:33] &gt;&gt; of this another country to this country
[3:17:39] when I want to speak
[3:17:42] to the president
[3:17:44] the president has to be at state house
[3:17:51] chair at the state house.
[3:17:55] Hallelujah.
[3:17:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:17:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:18:00] &gt;&gt; When there's a a pardon to be given
[3:18:05] &gt;&gt; the present has to be where
[3:18:11] &gt;&gt; at the state house on the
[3:18:15] so if you can go to the book of kings
[3:18:18] &gt;&gt; you'll find that the the chair of
[3:18:20] Solomon
[3:18:23] &gt;&gt; had how many steps?
[3:18:27] six steps.
[3:18:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:18:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:18:31] &gt;&gt; Have you ever heard about that before?
[3:18:34] [Music]
[3:18:39] &gt;&gt; Don't worry. If you if you don't
[3:18:41] understand, just write it down. You're
[3:18:42] going to read yourself. You are an
[3:18:45] eagle. I don't need to vomit into your
[3:18:47] anal. You're going to going to pick
[3:18:49] yourself. Amen.
[3:18:52] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[3:18:56] I have the scriptures here but uh if I
[3:18:59] just follow each and every scripture
[3:19:02] &gt;&gt; can you give me the book of Kings Kings
[3:19:04] 1 verse we should be
[3:19:08] I have it somewhere the throne
[3:19:11] &gt;&gt; 18
[3:19:13] yes uh Kings 1 Kings 10:19
[3:19:17] &gt;&gt; oh
[3:19:19] 109
[3:19:20] &gt;&gt; you find that the throne
[3:19:23] The throne had six steps.
[3:19:25] [Music]
[3:19:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:19:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:19:32] &gt;&gt; How many steps were there?
[3:19:38] &gt;&gt; No. No. Remember remember remember you
[3:19:41] are the seals.
[3:19:44] &gt;&gt; How many steps were there?
[3:19:49] &gt;&gt; Oh yes yes my brother.
[3:19:51] How many steps are there?
[3:19:55] &gt;&gt; Seven. But for the seventh one, for you
[3:19:57] to see it,
[3:20:00] &gt;&gt; the chair is a step.
[3:20:09] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:20:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:20:10] &gt;&gt; So, how many steps were there? There
[3:20:12] were seven.
[3:20:14] But when it come to the seven,
[3:20:17] it's always contest.
[3:20:23] It looks different.
[3:20:26] The seventh one was looking different.
[3:20:30] The others were just common.
[3:20:33] But the seven
[3:20:36] was different.
[3:20:38] So there were seven steps because the
[3:20:42] chair was there.
[3:20:47] So if the king was going to give any
[3:20:50] decisions,
[3:20:53] it has to be on the
[3:20:55] &gt;&gt; seventh step,
[3:21:00] not on the sixth step. No,
[3:21:04] sixth step is for the little people to
[3:21:07] sit on.
[3:21:10] First step is for the littlest.
[3:21:14] If you have to make any decision what we
[3:21:17] we have to climb how many steps
[3:21:21] seven
[3:21:23] once you are in that seven seal
[3:21:29] then you can say woman who is the owner
[3:21:31] of the child
[3:21:33] I am
[3:21:35] okay bring a sword here
[3:21:38] let me cut
[3:21:42] and the people say where This wisdom
[3:21:45] coming from
[3:21:47] the chair.
[3:21:52] You have gone above.
[3:21:55] &gt;&gt; You cannot make irrational decisions
[3:21:59] in the seventh seal.
[3:22:04] Hallelujah.
[3:22:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:22:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:22:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:22:13] That is why my brother, my sister,
[3:22:18] the Bible says
[3:22:21] I saw one
[3:22:25] sitting
[3:22:27] on the throne.
[3:22:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:22:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:22:32] &gt;&gt; Because if the ambassador from Malawi
[3:22:36] had to go and give Mr. Lamapos a letter
[3:22:39] from Malawi
[3:22:41] It doesn't it doesn't meet hotel
[3:22:46] and if if it happens here I I don't know
[3:22:48] how you do it here when the ambassador
[3:22:51] from another country comes to state
[3:22:52] house
[3:22:55] they have to be first a guard of honor
[3:22:58] of yeah the ambassador has to inspect a
[3:23:01] guard of honor
[3:23:04] &gt;&gt; before he gives the letters to the
[3:23:06] president
[3:23:10] because he's as good as the president of
[3:23:12] that country which he's coming from.
[3:23:17] So when you come to the book of Esther,
[3:23:22] even if Esther was a king or as a queen
[3:23:26] in a modest upper layer
[3:23:30] to approach the throne,
[3:23:32] the king had to extend the scepter.
[3:23:38] What is the scepter for?
[3:23:40] That's where the power is.
[3:23:43] Now
[3:23:47] &gt;&gt; Esther
[3:23:48] &gt;&gt; Esther
[3:23:49] &gt;&gt; touched
[3:23:50] &gt;&gt; a what?
[3:23:51] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:23:53] &gt;&gt; Yes, my brother.
[3:23:56] &gt;&gt; Esther what?
[3:23:57] &gt;&gt; Esther.
[3:24:02] &gt;&gt; Yes. Let's let's read. It's in the book
[3:24:05] of Esther. Esther.
[3:24:13] It's in the book of Esther. Anybody can
[3:24:15] hear Esther.
[3:24:24] &gt;&gt; Esther 5,
[3:24:30] my brother, verse one.
[3:24:36] And it came to pass
[3:24:39] on the third day that Esther put on her
[3:24:43] royal apparel.
[3:24:46] &gt;&gt; What is the loyal apparel?
[3:24:49] The word.
[3:24:53] She stood in the inner court of the king
[3:24:56] over against the king's house
[3:24:59] and he sat on the the king sat on his
[3:25:02] royal throne
[3:25:05] in the royal house.
[3:25:08] Two, it was so
[3:25:11] when the king
[3:25:14] saw the queen
[3:25:18] dressed
[3:25:20] &gt;&gt; in the yolo upper.
[3:25:25] He obtained favor
[3:25:28] in his sight.
[3:25:30] &gt;&gt; And the king
[3:25:32] held out
[3:25:35] to Esther,
[3:25:36] &gt;&gt; the god and scepter
[3:25:40] that was in his hand.
[3:25:43] So Esther
[3:25:45] come near and touched
[3:25:48] &gt;&gt; the top uh the the top of the sea.
[3:25:55] Hallelujah.
[3:25:56] &gt;&gt; The power of the king was now with
[3:26:00] Esther
[3:26:04] because the power is in the scepter.
[3:26:10] So the power
[3:26:14] &gt;&gt; is now with the bride.
[3:26:16] [Music]
[3:26:22] &gt;&gt; Climb up those seven seals, my brother.
[3:26:30] What? Don't Don't mind about the palmer
[3:26:32] worm, the coner worm, the caterpillar.
[3:26:36] We have walked through all that.
[3:26:39] This is time now to be power having
[3:26:41] power on the throne.
[3:26:44] And when
[3:26:47] touch that s
[3:26:49] &gt;&gt; that's the only time he said
[3:26:52] king do you know I got enemies
[3:26:58] so and so and so so the king says what
[3:27:04] bring them here for judgment.
[3:27:07] It's only when you can climb all those
[3:27:09] seven stairs
[3:27:12] to judge that scepter
[3:27:15] that you will have power.
[3:27:18] But you have to go through the
[3:27:20] caterpillar,
[3:27:21] the locus,
[3:27:24] the worm, the worm.
[3:27:29] Because each and every one of us is an
[3:27:34] army of God.
[3:27:39] You are a oneman army.
[3:27:50] &gt;&gt; My brother, you always underestimate
[3:27:51] yourself.
[3:27:56] You have the power.
[3:28:00] &gt;&gt; Now,
[3:28:02] how will the judgment of the earth come?
[3:28:06] When the bride
[3:28:09] &gt;&gt; comes over
[3:28:15] to be on the throne.
[3:28:20] The books were open
[3:28:23] because one sat on the
[3:28:26] on the throne. But there's somebody
[3:28:29] missing on the throne
[3:28:32] to bring judgment.
[3:28:37] That's why the the Bible says
[3:28:41] you
[3:28:42] &gt;&gt; you
[3:28:45] are going to judge the world.
[3:28:49] Because in the book of Esther,
[3:28:52] who brought judgment on Hammon?
[3:28:59] You see that?
[3:29:01] &gt;&gt; You see the the one book.
[3:29:07] &gt;&gt; Whoever Esther said should be should be
[3:29:10] raised was raised. You know was given a
[3:29:13] big seat.
[3:29:16] Who is that?
[3:29:19] &gt;&gt; Esther.
[3:29:21] But it was after she had put on a model
[3:29:23] up. had gone through all the balorm
[3:29:26] stage, conqueror stage,
[3:29:29] all the seven stage
[3:29:33] upon you.
[3:29:35] And actually this book is very nice.
[3:29:38] [Music]
[3:29:41] Do you know when Hmon was hanged
[3:29:46] after the feast?

[3:55:49] know assuredly that God hath made that
[3:55:52] same Jesus whom he have crucified both
[3:55:55] Lord and Christ. Now when they heard
[3:55:58] this, they were pricricked in their
[3:56:00] heart and said unto Peter and to the
[3:56:02] rest of the apostles, "Men and brethren,
[3:56:05] what shall we do?" Then Peter said unto
[3:56:08] them, "Repent and be baptized every one
[3:56:11] of you in the name of Jesus Christ for
[3:56:13] the remission of sins, and ye shall
[3:56:16] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. For
[3:56:19] the promise is unto you and to your

[3:58:48] word of prayer. God bless you.
[3:58:57] We married just now.
[3:59:05] &gt;&gt; Let us pray. Dear heavenly father, may
[3:59:08] all honor, glory, and majesty be unto
[3:59:10] thee. That people now are still giving
[3:59:14] their lives unto thee.
[3:59:17] &gt;&gt; When the whole world seems to have
[3:59:19] ignored you,
[3:59:21] some of them even selling their souls to
[3:59:23] the devil. But people are still coming
[3:59:26] to say, "Lord, save me."
[3:59:29] &gt;&gt; Here's another hand, Lord, extended to
[3:59:32] thee. I pray that you'll come and fill
[3:59:35] her with the same Holy Spirit which has
[3:59:37] taken us through the storms of life.
[3:59:41] Give her victory, Father. Fill her with
[3:59:44] the Holy Spirit. Let the same spirit
[3:59:46] which fell on the day of Pentecost be
[3:59:48] upon her today as I'm committing her
[3:59:50] into the holy hands. Let her be a pillar
[3:59:53] in her house, in her family, and in this
[3:59:57] church as I'm committing her into thine
[3:59:59] holy hands. Father, in Jesus Christ I
[4:00:02] pray. Amen.
[4:00:05] [Applause]
[4:00:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:00:15] Once again, can we just clap hands for
[4:00:17] the Lord?
[4:00:20] Amen.
[4:00:23] Pastor, thank you very much. May the
[4:00:27] Lord richly bless you and bless your
[4:00:30] family. Amen. And bless the church in
[4:00:33] Malawi. Amen. May the Lord richly bless
[4:00:37] you all. Just turn to your neighbor and
[4:00:40] say, "God bless you."
[4:00:44] Amen.
[4:00:47] We have a request from the pastor
[4:00:51] uh for Swaziland believers to come
[4:00:55] forth.
[4:00:57] I believe together with sister Marza
