[2:18] it as I've got some
[2:20] material from even from Pastor Roni amen
[2:25] um the DVD material
[2:37] and I will still have to uh uh search
[2:42] this some other things concerning now
[2:45] this
[2:50] time now you know of the message um the
[2:54] modern events made clear by
[2:58] prophecy events made clear by prophecy
[3:01] now as prophetic people we are
[3:05] blessed uh to live in this times
[3:09] of the Fulfillment of
[3:19] propes and it takes prophetic
[3:23] people to hear and understand these
[3:28] things
[3:30] so let's just open our
[3:33] hearts
[3:35] because um that's why we know when is
[3:40] the
[3:45] rupture as we read here in
[3:49] the we we didn't talk about the day of
[3:52] the Rapture the hour of the Rapture but
[3:55] when
[4:00] [Music]
[4:01] amen amen and let's turn to let's
[4:07] read Ezekiel 38 ver1 to7 Ezekiel 38 ver1
[4:13] to7 and the word of the Lord came unto
[4:16] me saying son of man set thy face again
[4:19] go the land of mog the chief Prince of
[4:22] mishak and tubah and prophesy against
[4:25] him and say thus said the Lord God
[4:30] behold I'm against thee oh go the chief
[4:33] Prince of mishak and tuba and I will
[4:36] turn thee back and put WS into thy jaws
[4:41] and I'll bring thee forth and all thy
[4:44] Army horses and hors man all of them
[4:48] clothed with all sorts of armor even a
[4:51] great company with buckles and shs all
[4:54] of them handling swords Persia Ethiopia
[4:58] and Libya with them all of them with
[5:01] shield and helmets GMA and All His Hands
[5:06] the house of Tu of the north quar and
[5:10] all the bands and many people with thee
[5:14] be thou prepared and prepare for thyself
[5:17] thou and all thy company that are
[5:20] assembled unto thee and be thou a god
[5:23] unto
[5:24] them I think I believe that uh some have
[5:28] got their own Bible
[5:30] and uh have read out of their Bibles you
[5:33] may be
[5:39] seated now now now we we have some
[5:46] events leading
[5:49] to
[5:52] um the white Throne
[5:57] judgment starting with
[6:00] the Gathering of the bride of
[6:05] Christ chosen from Seven Church
[6:11] ages I think one time we read about
[6:17] it I was in my when they asked
[6:21] me where do you get this thing I said in
[6:24] the in the spoken
[6:28] word spoken with I was reading about the
[6:31] seven battle
[6:37] lines uh because the prophet says each
[6:41] and every messenger comes and sounds his
[6:45] trumpet that is calling for a
[6:54] battle just as the Lord said I I will
[6:56] build my church Upon This Rock
[7:03] the gates of head shall
[7:06] not Prevail over
[7:11] it and uh so you know the battles are
[7:15] fought at the
[7:18] gate so that's why we have a seven
[7:24] Gates so every Minister
[7:27] comes he sounds it's a a call to
[7:33] [Music]
[7:35] battle so how many do we
[7:39] have we we have seven
[7:42] amen so we we we have this seven
[7:49] Gates amen amen now uh if you read we
[7:54] won't read now we'll see next time but
[7:57] your book uh the greatest ever
[8:02] fought the prophet says God's been
[8:06] selecting out of every
[8:13] church then after selection then that
[8:17] place remains a
[8:24] denomination and he selects out uh the
[8:29] prophet
[8:29] calls them uh uh he call after selection
[8:34] he he speaks of the size of the
[8:39] [Music]
[8:43] Overcomers now these people selected out
[8:46] of each Church
[8:50] age is the arm of
[8:56] God and that is the prophetic that is
[9:00] going to fight the battle
[9:07] ofed they were
[9:10] trained and
[9:14] selected and
[9:17] armed for for a special
[9:22] task and and Revelation chapter 19 says
[9:26] he shall come with them on horses
[9:33] he will gather them from the four
[9:34] quarters of
[9:38] Heaven it is in the seals
[9:41] book amen he he will gather them from
[9:44] the four quarters of
[9:49] Heaven for to to
[9:52] fight he'll come down uh we we'll pass
[9:57] we'll see some of these things as we
[10:00] proceed
[10:01] next now go and
[10:06] MOG go means
[10:09] Prince and means his his
[10:16] land amen amen and if we read in the
[10:22] Bible we realize that Genesis chapter 10
[10:30] if I can open Genesis chapter 10
[10:35] here
[10:38] um
[10:40] verse one now here are the generations
[10:43] of the sons of
[10:44] noem him and just jaff and unto them
[10:48] were Sons born After the flood the sons
[10:51] of jaff GMA and the MOG and the m and
[10:57] jaffin and tubal and mishak and Tyrus
[11:02] and the sons of now all these names
[11:07] Tokar you read verse three speaks of G
[11:13] ashim and
[11:21] tokara actually you find them in
[11:27] Russ most of the towns there of
[11:34] Russia but there's a town town I think
[11:37] it's called
[11:39] Toki in Russia they say it's named after
[11:49] tubal and we have M
[11:52] here which the historian
[11:56] says mosc
[12:01] and then you have H tokam all those
[12:07] names you you find them you you find
[12:10] them name you find the towns in Russia
[12:13] named after this
[12:17] names
[12:21] even amen amen so now
[12:25] but uh the thing is here
[12:29] now this will happen after the
[12:34] Rapture now when we finish you'll see
[12:37] how how close is the
[12:42] rupture amen this this
[12:46] may is a Time piece to
[12:52] us for the the the the word said when
[12:55] you see these things
[12:59] starting to happen beginning beginning
[13:02] to to to to
[13:04] happen know
[13:06] that it's the
[13:09] time amen amen amen now um this is after
[13:14] the Rapture during the tribulation
[13:17] period with is three and a half
[13:23] years
[13:25] because Rome
[13:29] [Music]
[13:31] um the best let me read
[13:36] it I read the book
[13:38] of what is Sals
[13:44] 518 518 uh after the
[13:48] Rapture I read this part
[13:52] here brother Bram you said that Rome
[13:54] would take the government of the Jews at
[13:56] the last three and and a half years
[14:04] that is during
[14:08] tribulation it will be the last three
[14:12] and 1 half years that's
[14:18] right not the first because it's already
[14:22] passed
[14:23] seven weeks seven weeks
[14:30] [Music]
[14:32] Messiah was cut
[14:36] short and then remained
[14:39] another three and a
[14:44] half amen amen now he says now during
[14:48] this last three and a
[14:54] half during the the calling of the Jews
[15:00] the the tribulation
[15:02] period the time of the
[15:05] Beast because when the bride goes the
[15:09] Satan takes his seat
[15:15] at amen amen and uh you know at Vatican
[15:22] there that's when that dictator what do
[15:26] you call that Italian dictator Marcon
[15:34] so he signed a treaty with we signed
[15:37] with the Pope
[15:40] there on one of the Seven Hills of
[15:47] Rome which is H I think it's the seventh
[15:53] Hill where where they signed
[15:57] that that piece of
[16:01] ground as we call Vatican
[16:05] today is independently under the Church
[16:13] Rome now that's why the Bible speaks of
[16:17] the
[16:19] Cities we have Jerusalem the
[16:23] city we have Vatican the
[16:25] city so Jerusalem is the city of God
[16:30] Vatican is the city of
[16:34] Lucifer so you see both
[16:38] cities we have this
[16:42] woman and the one that sth on
[16:47] there and then we have another
[16:51] woman which is the bride of
[16:54] Christ so you see these cities this
[16:57] women and so forth
[17:01] then we have the prophet
[17:04] here Mal
[17:07] 4 Revelation 10:7 all those
[17:11] scriptures and we have another Prophet
[17:13] here the
[17:16] Beast amen amen so now this one appears
[17:21] uh after the
[17:23] [Music]
[17:24] Rapture which is the Beast
[17:29] you haven't seen anything of the Beast
[17:32] they they will see
[17:38] it after the
[17:42] Rapture that's the that the prophet
[17:46] says um in whatever you are
[17:51] doing don't go that
[17:56] way amen because after the Rapture
[18:00] there is no God has taken his
[18:05] spirit amen and the only Grace that
[18:08] remains is for the
[18:12] Jews because that's when
[18:16] 144,000 will be called
[18:21] out 144,000
[18:24] Jews by Moses and Elijah
[18:29] now
[18:31] um you have said many times that
[18:33] communism was raised by God to serve his
[18:36] purpose as like King
[18:46] Nebuchadnezzar now where did Communism
[18:49] fit into the
[18:50] picture um that will finally
[18:56] do how does it wind up
[19:00] many scholars believe that in the
[19:02] Kingdom of the north go and MOG
[19:05] mentioned in the scriptures goes down
[19:08] against
[19:16] Israel you know Satan even in the
[19:21] Bible he has chosen North the north part
[19:29] did you read that in the
[19:31] Bible Satan
[19:34] himself he wanted to
[19:36] establish his kingdom in the
[19:41] north it is even in your books your
[19:45] Cod where the Prophet says you see he
[19:49] wanted to outshine the
[19:52] Creator he wanted to make a better
[19:55] Kingdom than that of the creator
[20:00] but
[20:01] where in the
[20:04] north now God and may God comes is
[20:07] coming from the north
[20:11] parts as even in the prophecies that
[20:14] were given
[20:17] out the
[20:19] third was it the third one watch Russia
[20:22] watch Russia King of the North
[20:30] uh you'll check it and make make sure
[20:32] but I think it's the the thought
[20:37] vision and what was the
[20:41] seventh the prophet says I
[20:46] say the prophet
[20:48] says I saw a smok
[20:54] explosion that was America
[20:59] okay amen I will remind you of these
[21:01] things the Lord
[21:04] will now that communism will finally
[21:07] destroy
[21:13] Catholicism vtic by
[21:19] explosion
[21:21] now we've got a m
[21:25] material when we were on our way to
[21:28] Queen we uh happen to be at the
[21:31] brother's
[21:36] house uh with brother
[21:39] Ron and we were shown this part where
[21:43] Russian generals drunk Russian
[21:50] generals and they
[21:52] saying uh they don't understand why they
[21:56] should not bomb America
[22:02] so now uh the prophet says it will take
[22:07] like a mad
[22:11] man or like a
[22:14] drunk to press that
[22:17] button to press that
[22:21] button you you see Russia Russia Russia
[22:25] is not interested in some uh conflict
[22:28] like Iran and I mean
[22:34] Iraq no God prepared
[22:39] Russia for a special thing at the end of
[22:46] time just like he prepared
[22:51] nebz punish
[22:54] Israel is amen amen nebuchad was
[22:59] a
[23:00] Believer but God prepared him militarily
[23:03] and so
[23:06] forth just to punish his
[23:11] people amen amen so the prophet now says
[23:16] finally communism is referring to
[23:21] Russia because the Bible
[23:24] says that is from he will come from the
[23:27] north path
[23:28] the the at
[23:32] North which is
[23:35] Russia amen amen and
[23:40] um uh let me go back to the
[23:43] scriptures so and I quote
[23:48] again I think the book Daniel 7
[23:52] weeks 7 weeks of Daniel
[23:56] um where is it now page 39
[24:01] yeah9
[24:03] um I will read this part
[24:08] here is that the
[24:12] part all
[24:14] right
[24:15] uh it's talking of the the spreading of
[24:19] the Roman power to conquer all the
[24:21] Sleeping Visions Jews and so forth
[24:30] and they will break the Covenant in the
[24:33] middle of the
[24:37] week did you know last time the pope
[24:39] went
[24:40] to
[24:45] Isel okay amen so Rome is already
[24:50] working on that um relationship he wants
[24:55] to have with Israel
[24:59] [Music]
[25:02] all right amen because it's leading to
[25:06] that and
[25:08] even I read that in in in Palestine or
[25:13] in
[25:15] Israel uh preparations are being made uh
[25:19] the old
[25:20] ruins are being
[25:23] um what's name Resto restored
[25:27] [Music]
[25:31] they're looking for the old
[25:37] places even the the
[25:41] attire used to be used by the um priests
[25:46] and so
[25:47] [Music]
[25:50] forth they they're looking for all those
[25:55] things and um um at the place called The
[26:00] Valley Of
[26:03] jel that's where the Battle of shall be
[26:08] uh fought
[26:12] fought it is called the valy
[26:23] ofo and uh now we are not talking about
[26:26] a myth here listen
[26:29] we are talking about something that will
[26:30] take place very
[26:36] soon when we were now uh uh these
[26:41] days I will let me read to you this
[26:46] first uh he will
[26:49] break during the the last three and a
[26:53] half years Rome
[27:01] do you know in the time of the Lord
[27:03] Jesus
[27:08] Christ uh Israel was under Rome Rome
[27:15] is now because the Messiah is coming
[27:18] back to the
[27:22] Jews Rome is going
[27:26] there and Moses and Elijah are going
[27:29] [Music]
[27:31] there now it's going to be a conflict
[27:36] again amen amen but the prophet says
[27:40] Moses and
[27:42] Elijah will give them a hard
[27:47] time until finally they are
[27:52] killed then Rome will
[27:55] break the the the relationship
[27:58] [Music]
[28:00] ship amen amen that's when terrible
[28:05] things
[28:09] now but now our theme is on the King of
[28:13] the
[28:17] North amen amen now I read uh
[28:32] if you're not sleeping my brother you
[28:34] may write these things down and read
[28:35] them at home I should have C rather than
[28:39] seals C is seals somebody can get volume
[28:44] 2 while we are
[28:48] proceeding now
[28:51] Ezekiel we've
[28:53] got go and make of Ezekiel
[28:58] God bless and I think
[29:01] brother has tried something for us
[29:09] here means means his eel prophecy
[29:20] 615 theel is coming from the north parts
[29:24] Ezekiel 38:1 to 5 Ezekiel 38 all those
[29:29] scriptures referring to the same thing
[29:31] it's Russia King of the North against
[29:34] Israel after the
[29:41] Rapture now you have another go and
[29:47] MOG that is in the Book of Revelation
[29:51] now this go and meog comes at the end of
[29:55] the
[29:56] Millennium go
[30:00] this one is not from the atus North but
[30:02] is from the four quarters of the
[30:07] earth that is Revelation
[30:10] 20:7
[30:13] 11 and Seven Seals page 513 to
[30:20] 514 if you can find them you can always
[30:24] come back
[30:28] right amen so because go and meog it's
[30:32] not a name here it means Prince and
[30:37] [Music]
[30:39] his that's why you have go of
[30:43] Ezekiel and you have go of Revelation
[30:47] the book of
[30:48] re which just means Prince and his now
[30:52] here he appears as Satan here is Satan
[30:55] in the Book of Revelation
[31:00] Ezekiel is a political
[31:05] leader but that is Russia and Russia is
[31:09] right now preparing for that are you
[31:17] listening Russia is preparing to fulfill
[31:20] this
[31:25] prophecy not not tomorrow this
[31:31] morning when we were in
[31:35] Malawi brother Ron in the
[31:39] morning he switch on for the
[31:45] news
[31:47] now now when we
[31:49] met he said to
[31:51] me uh you
[31:54] know the news this morning
[32:00] uh they
[32:02] say Russia
[32:05] Russia
[32:07] uh has placed some about
[32:11] 600 missiles
[32:15] [Music]
[32:19] inan Russia Russ okay now why why
[32:26] because
[32:28] you know these
[32:30] days there's been this uh
[32:34] um talk about America wanting to stop
[32:38] Iran from making a nuclear
[32:46] bomb those who follow these things they
[32:49] know what I'm talking
[32:51] about amen amen
[32:54] amen so um
[32:59] it's happening right
[33:01] now even the new
[33:06] Obama he he inherits the same problem
[33:10] they have with
[33:11] [Music]
[33:14] Iran IR is developing a
[33:20] bomb nuclear
[33:22] bomb amen amen the bomb we are talking
[33:26] about
[33:28] has never ever
[33:32] ever or it was never at any time
[33:38] used now some uh they have seen the the
[33:43] DVD um the last the final
[33:49] chapter chapter so we pity those who who
[33:51] are not interested in those things the
[33:53] Final
[33:55] Chapter they are not aware of
[33:59] times it is like in the days of
[34:04] Noah amen amen so even
[34:08] today one says I don't watch DVD I don't
[34:12] read papers I don't read
[34:15] that that doesn't make you a better
[34:21] Christian we we we need information
[34:24] [Applause]
[34:25] [Music]
[34:29] I've seen my
[34:31] Prophet searching these
[34:34] things watching the
[34:37] news reading the
[34:39] papers my
[34:43] Prophet
[34:45] amen so as a
[34:49] minister he goes
[34:52] around he he is sensitive to the times
[34:58] now as a
[35:00] minister he needs
[35:04] information in whatever manner he can
[35:07] get
[35:09] it to come and to warn the
[35:16] people amen amen so these things the
[35:20] things you are going to read about are
[35:21] happening right
[35:24] now the prophecy of Ezekiel
[35:29] is
[35:30] now being
[35:34] fulfilled
[35:36] only it will be finally H it will be
[35:40] finalized after the Rapture when the
[35:42] bright is
[35:48] gone but we are just looking at the
[35:51] kitten
[35:55] ra amen amen

[37:49] Hills on our
[37:52] side leading to the desert
[37:57] that standing in the
[38:00] Gap amen amen to a continental
[38:07] divide Seven
[38:10] Hills so God showed him Seven
[38:14] Hills and the prophet saw seven
[38:20] heels Seven
[38:22] Seals all those things
[38:25] amen exactly yes br
[38:28] that's now now
[38:31] listen the name Pia was changed to
[38:36] Iran
[38:39] 1935 but in I think October
[38:44] 1932 Moscow which is
[38:47] Russia signed a treaty with
[38:51] Iran what what what was it
[38:55] for stating that
[38:57] [Music]
[38:58] in the event of the uh Soviet War or
[39:03] Russian war Russia
[39:09] [Music]
[39:12] war in the event of a Russian war the
[39:16] Russia will be allowed to pass without
[39:19] resistance to pass through
[39:24] Iran because Russia broke TI with
[39:31] Israel and they said it openly that they
[39:34] are going to destroy
[39:39] Jerusalem I Shar this with brother some
[39:42] years
[39:45] back it appeared on a
[39:48] magazine Russia saying we are going to
[39:51] blow up
[39:54] Israel now the eye of Russia is on
[39:58] America and
[40:02] [Music]
[40:04] Israel amen this conflicts like Iran and
[40:08] what what Russia is not there it's
[40:12] noted as the prophet says God prepared
[40:16] him for a certain
[40:20] purpose that's to
[40:24] punish both Rome America and all
[40:30] this who
[40:33] rejected amen amen that's why he says he
[40:37] saw America Going Up in
[40:42] Smoke okay now now now uh the way to
[40:50] Jerusalem their war path goes through
[40:54] Iran the King of the North
[40:59] he has to come through
[41:02] Iran so that's why they signed a
[41:07] treaty
[41:10] 19322 because it was already in the
[41:14] heart of the King of the
[41:21] North amen amen so a treaty now I read
[41:25] something here
[41:27] so in the second world
[41:30] war German
[41:33] troops were stopped trying to March into
[41:40] Iran why they were stopped it's
[41:45] because H the prophecy
[41:49] said it's go King of the
[41:54] North who will possess those
[41:59] Gates not
[42:02] Germany amen amen now now we we'll read
[42:07] some of these
[42:10] things um I was opening this
[42:13] one
[42:15] although brother reflected them
[42:20] there so
[42:23] if you want to follow these things you
[42:25] can read it at home
[42:29] now will Ezekiel 38 and 39 come to pass
[42:33] before the Rapture that's a
[42:38] question now if you'll notice that's the
[42:40] answer if you'll
[42:42] notice eel 3839 deals with Gog and
[42:49] MOG which is
[42:52] Russia that's the prophet speaking
[42:57] amen
[43:00] Mal the North
[43:04] Country amen amen H I do not say that
[43:08] this is
[43:11] correct amen
[43:13] amen what do you
[43:18] say but to my way of teaching
[43:22] it comes to pass after the Rapture
[43:28] now we say Amen to that today
[43:31] amen so the prophet is
[43:36] correct amen that's to my way of
[43:40] teaching
[43:43] it after the church is taken
[43:46] up and God deals with Gog and
[43:50] MOG when they come down before Israel
[43:55] there and I I think that will come to
[43:58] pass after the
[44:01] Rapture amen
[44:04] amen and the bright
[44:09] says God bless you amen now I want to
[44:13] read you
[44:15] from the testimony of the Jews
[44:23] themselves now these things will happen
[44:27] after the
[44:29] Rapture the Bride of the gentle bride is
[44:40] [Music]
