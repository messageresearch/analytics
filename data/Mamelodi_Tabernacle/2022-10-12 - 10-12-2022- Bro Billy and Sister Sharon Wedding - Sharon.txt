[Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Applause] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] maintenance yes okay now this is amazing the wonderful audience and it was foreign [Music] up Mom okay so we'll start by reading a scripture we all believe that it started back there in the Garden of Eden when the first Masterpiece was introduced by the master by the master we'll start by reading from a revelation Genesis chapter 5 verse 1 to 2. again it says chapter 1 verses another wonderful day we thank you Father that you have you have made this day and the day has arrived for all of us to Rejoice bless this marriage Lord God um even before the foundation of the world so we are glad for the proceedings yeah [Music] the proceedings that started before the foundation of the world I thank you Lord Jesus Christ bless the parents in Jesus Christ name I pray amen okay you may be seated for a while and so so glad to be invited to this wonderful day now I'm just going to read a scripture is not going to be a preaching service but a wedding firstly we have a Genesis chapter 5 verse 1 to 2. if I versus one two this is the book of the generations of Adam in that day that God created man in the likeness of God made him male and female created he them and blessed them and called their name did you see their name brother do you see their name there I'm very he called their name Adam oh is this English as well God bless you um Genesis chapter 5 verse 1 the tomb mama [Music] foreign [Music] God bless you okay here we're looking at the but at this scripture that their name was called Adam all right not Adam and if not Adam and Eve [Music] the name if came after when after the fall and before amen daily Genesis chapter 3 verse 20 says Genesis chapter 3 in dime I will read it for you quickly okay the original name is what are the other foreign somebody else wife in the Lord mom it's still that you can only marry that part of yourself um amen and if married in Christ where will divorce come from foreign there won't be diverse now I read now I read so when Jesus was asked for many years I'll quickly turn also to the book of [Music] quickly I'll find this scripture here chapter 3 verse 3 chapter 19 yeah three the Pharisees also came unto him tempting him and saying unto him is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause foreign [Music] which made them at the beginning made them male and female that's the scripture that we have just read uh he made them men he he called their name Adam verse 5 and said for this causal a man live father and mother and shall cleft to his wife and they twin shall be one flesh [Music] now uh listen to it carefully for this course shall a man live father and mother foreign [Music] [Applause] foreign it was not in God's plan for us to be born of men and women [Music] original system of God we were created in that system of God death Beth was introduced later then the Lord said to the woman from today Thou shalt bring children in this manner but it was not so much Man was created not born um that's why if you come through birth and the Bible says You must be born again that's why we all are supposed to be born again amen because of the best a child coming through birth was the premi that was not the original plan of God [Music] it was just a permissive will I [Music] am okay now we are looking at this that's why it says men shall leave his father and mother as as a restoration [Music] because when he got married he had no father and mother but it is sin that caused all that [Music] money all right now before yeah men shall live father and mother um to his wife he didn't say his girlfriend but to his wife because originally that's how they were made the same scripture God created amen amen male and female created he them okay amen now uh Savannah we are going to read this masterpiece that has closed all this uh marital problems did you know that in Christ there is no diverse [Music] do you know that um it is not from God I see now from God he made them men and female that is now before a man can marry as we were taught even by the prophet of God the seventh angel messenger so you don't go around looking for one but you go straight to God and they pray to God for your wife that is already there amenities by predestination when you were born you your wife was also born somewhere else foreign they will come along in your heart [Music] foreign the Bible says the elders in the house don't marry until you you meet eliasa wait for aliyaza Festival now this is said to him go and find a wife for my son he is he never said go go and find a girlfriend for my son but a wife for my son started and the Bible says he was the eldest in the house of Abraham Aries just like a God when he he's he sent his Elder the the seventh angel messenger is an elder in the house even for the bride of Christ to be called God has sent the elders in the house [Applause] so I said behold I will send you Elijah the prophet shall turn their hearts of the father children back to their fathers yes because if then it is back to the fathers then you are in order [Applause] and the wine because it has to come through the bloodline um he never said the the woman you are going to find for my son um would be like this or this or that um because the real person there was God himself and guys why this messenger uh when he arrived where it was at the well a finale but you see amen where women came for to collect water uh he never looked he prayed to God [Music] and said to let it be a woman of this nature is in this amen amen and that woman started to act according to the prayer gave him water and said I will also give the camels our numbers that was the prayer of alias let her be the one who give me water and also the camels all right it was predestinated God can match things up [Music] he matched you with your wife man man that the appointed time you are you will find your wife he was there already prepared before the foundation of the world one scripture here I won't be long here you know today we have things like marriage divorce marriage divorce foreign you go to a garage one garage is selling cars new new cars and so forth and if you go through and pass by a scrap yard um you know that that that cow of the Year so-called in the in that garage is coming to this scrapyard amen that's why some people in the world when they marry foreign you know they no they are not sure that they will go together up to the end so so you know it is like that without Christ while the people are preparing for a marriage of the same marriage they are also preparing for the end of the same marriage it's like that in the world today [Music] okay but not in Christ in Christ once married always eternally married Christ now so much he says have you not read that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female because he didn't want the mail to be going around looking for the females uh and he said for this question a man live father and mother and they shall Cliff to his wife they turn shall be one flesh now um let me ask this question if the two are one can one divorce itself foreign now my question is can one divorce itself foreign [Music] foreign that's all we can lose you're all right that's why in Christ says now wherefore they are no more time but one flesh you add it to be remorse what they forgot hath joined together let no men put us under [Music] even if you can promise me Millions I will never be a minister that will his job will be to separate men and women [Applause] but another thing no one can separate men and women that are predestinated [Music] because the Bible says what God has done shall stand forever and ever and ever remember if there's a separation then there was a separation [Applause] maybe you didn't hear it maybe you didn't hear um if the there is a separation that means there was a separation because what God has done shall stand forever the Bible says so forever [Music] if it's separated then it's separated okay [Applause] now let's just look at the last thing here the first Covenant was one man one woman you know even polygamy um when Jesus arrived because Moses allowed them for polygamy and the Lord the Lord Jesus says yes it was because of the hardness [Music] you know there was always a long queue there at the Moses office you know couples coming in one accusing the other cars and the Moses would end up allowing them foreign [Music] [Music] actually uh you know that the name if it's not here originally uh it is Adam who called her if [Music] that's what God called her yes they are named not her name their name was called foreign that's the name that's why they are going to be called what is their name now [Music] the name will be coaching guide [Applause] that is but after the fall one became amen after the fall they come with different names the Covenant was broken but they come under one name [Applause] Adam [Music] where the name if came from not from God Jesus God called them Adam [Applause] but after after the fall the same if you read Genesis chapter 3 verse 20. tells you this uh for many people now this is the restoration of things here and Adam called his wife's name if Adam occurred Adam let's say it God called her Adam or rather he called them Adam yes Adam changed the name of this wife and said from today you are if um if he was not her original name yeah her original name is Adam but after she was offered a fruit from the tree when Adam looked at her um and then he said that is verse 20 and Adam called his wife's name if Adam not God Adam amen amen because she was the mother of all living she was the mother of the firstborn you are kind and able yeah that caused a change [Music] from today you are if we have the mother of all whether it's Cain or raise able when the church is is reconciled why we make it is called Christ that is his church and formerly his church he said it shall be called by his name the Lord Jesus Christ is the name foreign Jesus the Lord God in Jerusalem that is not the name of the church [Applause] and his bride their name is Christ uh Christ meaning the anointed [Music] you see so that's why the names come after the fall um the names interpreted the separations those under this name has their own way of worshiping [Music] this also under this name they have their own way of worship that's what names mean names mean separated they are not coming under one spiritual umbrella each and every one of uh this this names has her own way of worship [Laughter] like the film stars you know I I I think you understand film stars [Music] when they marry they don't change their names because they can they can separate any they can marry today and separate tomorrow [Music] then the man remains Richard button um but but they are married amen not under the original plan of God this wonderful today the marriage of the Believers in Christ May men shall live his father and and you mothers the restoration of the first Covenant because the first under the first Covenant you've got no father and mother God Covenant by a permissive will of God not the original will of God the original will of God they came under creation [Music] is that sure uh that's why before you can marry foreign [Music] it should be from God then it will remain in God [Music] that's why they had to be born again in order uh you are restored first now let me read maybe the last thing here you know that was the marriage according to the first Covenant did you know that um if you are not born again you can pray and fast and pray but it won't help the cause because to be born again you are back to the course you connected back to the original and once connected to the original you will marry your wife [Applause] because she was your wife because one so to reconnect you come through the new birth apart from that you you can pray um it won't help it is not through prayer it is through New Birth you must be born again then if you are born again you are connected back to the original plan of God what was a planned as your wife will remain your wife amen [Music] that's wonderful man that's why you know when the people when they buy a car uh the first thing they are thinking of is the insurance and they also what is you buy a new car the first thing in your mind just counted them one is called tracker yes uh you are thinking of tracker many many years and insurance and all those things because there's something in you you've got a double um what would say program um one is buying a car the other one is losing that car through theft or whatever that's why when a child is born what happens they go they think of burial society and you know we think first of that humans amen sort of they go like that Jesus when a child is born you watch if we don't believe God we start by taking the child to you know the bones and foreign we just believe in God and God will take care of this wedding he will take care of this couple you know when you your maybe you're driving your car um it indicates empty tank foreign you feel in my food if you wake up to find a snake in your house you can't pray while the snake is yeah foreign foreign yes it's a wonderful wedding in our way restoration the law of restoration they have they returned back to God and God has returned unto them all that was planned for them foreign you know I was a I may from South Africa but originally from heaven [Applause] amen originally we we are from heaven [Music] amen only after the fall God came with the Redemption plan to redeem is to take anything back to Israel original uh place or our original life let me read
