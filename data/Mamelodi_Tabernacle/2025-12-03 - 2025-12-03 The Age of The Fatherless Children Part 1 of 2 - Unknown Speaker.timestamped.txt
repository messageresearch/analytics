[0:31] Amen.
[0:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:32] &gt;&gt; Let's turn to the scripture and start
[0:35] reading.
[0:37] &gt;&gt; Pray for us next
[0:40] next week. We won't be around for over
[0:43] the weekend.
[0:47] We are trying to limit our visit.
[0:53] But they are beyond our
[0:56] control.
[0:59] &gt;&gt; Let us read
[1:02] &gt;&gt; second Timothy chapter 4 from verse one
[1:06] to verse 8. I judge thee be therefore
[1:11] before God and the Lord Jesus Christ who
[1:15] shall judge the quick and the dead at
[1:19] his appearing and his kingdom. Preach
[1:23] the word, be instant in season, out of
[1:27] season, reprove,
[1:30] rebuke, exalt with all longsufferings
[1:35] and doctrine. For a time will come when
[1:38] they will not endure sound doctrine, but
[1:42] after their own lusts shall they heap to
[1:46] themselves teachers, having itching
[1:49] ears, and they shall turn away their
[1:52] ears from the truth, and shall be turned
[1:56] unto fables. But watch thou in all
[2:00] things and due afflictions do the work
[2:03] of an evangelist. Make full proof of thy
[2:08] ministry. For I am now ready to be
[2:12] offered. And the time of my departure is
[2:15] at hand. I have fought a good fight. I
[2:19] have finished my course. I have kept the
[2:21] faith. Henceforth there is laid upon for
[2:25] me a crown of righteousness, which the
[2:29] Lord, the righteous judge, shall give me
[2:32] at that day, and not to me only, but
[2:37] unto all them also that love his
[2:40] appearing.
[2:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:46] &gt;&gt; I think it's fine.
[2:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:49] &gt;&gt; They've got their Amen. uh uh Bibles.
[2:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:54] &gt;&gt; Uh if you may offer a prayer
[2:57] &gt;&gt; before the proceedings.
[3:02] &gt;&gt; Our most dear loving heavenly father.
[3:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:05] &gt;&gt; Once again this morning we've read your
[3:07] word of life.
[3:09] &gt;&gt; And father, here is your man's servant
[3:11] standing before us.
[3:13] &gt;&gt; Dear Lord, a vessel that you are going
[3:15] to use to open this word. Lord.
[3:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:19] &gt;&gt; We may have open Bibles on the physical
[3:22] side, but Father, we we desire and
[3:24] require the spiritual opening of this
[3:26] word
[3:27] &gt;&gt; by revelation again. And Father, we know
[3:30] &gt;&gt; that there's only one way that you use,
[3:32] and that is the way of a man.
[3:34] &gt;&gt; And Father, again, we pray for our
[3:35] pastor that you come and indwelling,
[3:38] &gt;&gt; speak through him again this morning as
[3:40] you bring your word of life to us in the
[3:43] name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
[3:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:46] You may be seated.
[3:51] &gt;&gt; I believe winter hasn't
[3:55] comes yet.
[3:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:00] &gt;&gt; It's not yet winter.
[4:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. It's
[4:05] &gt;&gt; all right.
[4:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:07] &gt;&gt; Now,
[4:09] I just have a
[4:12] a little thought.
[4:14] um
[4:17] as God has just put it in my heart
[4:24] when I was actually working on something
[4:26] else,
[4:28] something else. And uh it looks like God
[4:33] has set that one aside for some time
[4:39] and
[4:41] pointed me to the book of Timothy.
[4:45] Timothy.
[4:47] &gt;&gt; Then yesterday I noticed that the book
[4:50] of Timothy is the book of a father and
[4:54] his son.
[5:00] Amen. Amen.
[5:01] &gt;&gt; Paul and Timothy.
[5:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:07] Now then I decided to read that one a
[5:12] father and his son.
[5:17] Hallelujah.
[5:20] And while thinking along those lines,
[5:26] then I came up with the
[5:30] a subject,
[5:33] the age of the fatherless children.
[5:37] Hallelujah.
[5:42] I grew up without a father
[5:48] &gt;&gt; and uh our my father left us when we
[5:52] were still young.
[5:56] That's why every time you you will
[6:00] always hear me mentioning my mother, not
[6:02] my father
[6:08] because
[6:10] Um, without a father,
[6:15] &gt;&gt; uh, there's nothing to refer back to.
[6:21] &gt;&gt; And now
[6:24] fatherless child.
[6:27] Hallelujah.
[6:29] They grow up
[6:33] without guidance.
[6:37] Amen. or
[6:41] commitment
[6:42] &gt;&gt; commitment.
[6:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:44] &gt;&gt; Or instruction.
[6:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:48] &gt;&gt; Well,
[6:51] God will always give a mother wisdom.
[6:58] Amen.
[7:00] &gt;&gt; In the absence of their father.
[7:04] &gt;&gt; Amen. as he did that with my mother.
[7:11] That's why every time
[7:14] I can only refer to my mother
[7:19] and my father married married another
[7:22] woman somewhere
[7:26] and yet
[7:28] now
[7:30] &gt;&gt; for me to refer to a father
[7:34] that's when referring to God.
[7:39] Amen.
[7:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[7:43] &gt;&gt; He's been my father all along.
[7:47] &gt;&gt; He took care of me.
[7:52] He has taught me
[7:56] things about life.
[8:01] &gt;&gt; And I realized that
[8:04] he is a a real father. Amen.
[8:12] &gt;&gt; Who will never teach you and marry
[8:15] another woman.
[8:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[8:21] &gt;&gt; So
[8:24] it's now I want to now a a a children a
[8:29] child without a father
[8:34] &gt;&gt; and without God.
[8:38] cannot trace himself
[8:45] because
[8:47] if you are a child, you are a gene
[8:53] father.
[8:55] Amen.
[8:56] &gt;&gt; The father is the seed carrier.
[9:02] Amen.
[9:03] &gt;&gt; Mama is the field.
[9:06] Amen.
[9:07] &gt;&gt; The Bible says so.
[9:09] Amen. Amen. Amen.
[9:12] &gt;&gt; God partnershipped them like that
[9:17] for the law of reproduction to take
[9:20] place
[9:24] because men the male alone cannot bring
[9:28] forth children.
[9:32] Amen. So that's why God said it is not
[9:35] good that men should be alone.
[9:40] [applause]
[9:41] Amen.
[9:42] &gt;&gt; Because the law of reproduction
[9:46] would not apply.
[9:50] So he made him a help me
[9:57] not something for to abuse
[10:02] a partner.
[10:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:07] &gt;&gt; Because
[10:08] Adam being alone
[10:11] he could not reproduce.
[10:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:16] &gt;&gt; He will just remain alone.
[10:20] Yes.
[10:21] &gt;&gt; For Jesus being alone,
[10:25] &gt;&gt; he could not reproduce.
[10:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:30] &gt;&gt; He must have a bride.
[10:35] Amen.
[10:36] &gt;&gt; Now Paul talking to a son.
[10:44] &gt;&gt; He has found in Timothy a real spiritual
[10:48] son. Amen.
[10:55] &gt;&gt; And he started to download all that he
[10:58] had upon Timothy.
[11:04] Amen. Seeing that
[11:07] by the time he leaves the field
[11:11] there is a a successor.
[11:17] Amen. Timothy will take over.
[11:22] &gt;&gt; So if you read the whole book of
[11:26] Timothy,
[11:28] you'll find that Paul was just working
[11:31] on Timothy.
[11:35] Amen. Amen. Now here he's talking to
[11:38] Timothy
[11:42] and to the church
[11:45] and but Timothy is
[11:49] the keystone there
[11:54] and as he says
[11:57] preached the word.
[12:00] &gt;&gt; Timothy was a young man.
[12:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. You find this young men like
[12:06] David,
[12:10] Daniel,
[12:12] Shadrach,
[12:16] you find them in the Bible,
[12:20] young men.
[12:22] Now why young
[12:27] um
[12:29] I read a part here
[12:32] that
[12:35] in the book of Genesis
[12:38] the first man was a young man.
[12:43] Amen. [cheering]
[12:44] [applause] Amen.
[12:46] And it says here, there was a tree of
[12:49] life
[12:52] in the future home book.
[12:55] And this tree of life
[12:58] reminded Adam
[13:02] of his youth.
[13:06] His youth was continually going on.
[13:13] Amen. Amen. Because the tree was for the
[13:16] healing,
[13:19] keeping him young.
[13:23] Amen.
[13:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:27] &gt;&gt; So we need that tree today.
[13:31] Amen. Amen.
[13:34] When
[13:36] Abraham and Sarah were stricken in age,
[13:44] Elohim cameoh
[13:48] &gt;&gt; and uh
[13:51] the Bible says
[13:53] &gt;&gt; he changed them.
[13:57] &gt;&gt; They they were changed
[13:59] within
[14:04] &gt;&gt; because
[14:07] uh they were beyond their prime.
[14:12] Hallelujah.
[14:13] &gt;&gt; They couldn't
[14:15] bear. She couldn't bear children.
[14:20] &gt;&gt; But God said to Abraham,
[14:23] "I I shall return
[14:26] according to the time of life,
[14:30] and Sarah, your wife, shall have a son."
[14:34] Amen.
[14:41] &gt;&gt; Science wouldn't touch that.
[14:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:47] &gt;&gt; Let me read you something here.
[14:50] Amen. Um I
[14:55] prefer to talk to you
[14:58] then
[15:00] and you'll see that
[15:03] both physically and spiritually
[15:07] this is the age of the fatherless.
[15:16] Spiritually you find children
[15:21] without a father
[15:24] &gt;&gt; now
[15:26] without any direction.
[15:30] &gt;&gt; Now they heap upon themselves teachers
[15:37] with itching ears
[15:43] to hear.
[15:47] &gt;&gt; Now the world today
[15:50] Yes.
[15:54] &gt;&gt; Is
[15:56] have you seen technology today?
[15:59] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[16:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:02] &gt;&gt; WhatsApp.
[16:03] &gt;&gt; WhatsApp.
[16:04] &gt;&gt; Exactly.
[16:05] &gt;&gt; Facebook.
[16:06] &gt;&gt; Facebook.
[16:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[16:10] &gt;&gt; And uh maybe next time there will be a
[16:13] body book.
[16:16] &gt;&gt; Body book. [applause]
[16:20] Next time a feed book,
[16:25] it's coming like that.
[16:29] &gt;&gt; You have Diablo number one.
[16:33] &gt;&gt; It's evil
[16:37] then number two.
[16:39] &gt;&gt; A bit more evil.
[16:43] &gt;&gt; So they make sure that the people get
[16:45] used to these things.
[16:48] So, so they come in stages.
[16:53] Amen.
[16:53] &gt;&gt; To kill
[16:55] &gt;&gt; a child of today,
[17:00] &gt;&gt; brainwash him or her,
[17:04] &gt;&gt; brainwash him or her.
[17:08] And of course,
[17:10] it will start with mind control.
[17:16] Hallelujah.
[17:17] &gt;&gt; Until
[17:20] &gt;&gt; they don't have their own convictions.
[17:25] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[17:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:27] &gt;&gt; Now
[17:29] number three. Number three.
[17:31] &gt;&gt; Number four.
[17:32] &gt;&gt; Number four.
[17:33] &gt;&gt; I don't know if number five has come
[17:35] already,
[17:37] &gt;&gt; but number four has killed people.
[17:42] I' I've got records on it
[17:45] how it has killed some people both young
[17:48] and old
[17:52] and yet the people will never quit.
[17:57] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh. Amen.
[17:58] &gt;&gt; All right. Amen.
[18:00] &gt;&gt; In life life is like this.
[18:04] Um we used to climb the body mountain.
[18:11] First thing you standing before a
[18:14] mountain
[18:16] you don't see the other side
[18:21] then you start climbing
[18:24] as you are going up
[18:26] you are growing taller
[18:31] when you reach the top of the mountain
[18:34] now you are taller than the mountain
[18:39] then now you can see beyond and up
[18:44] and the four quarters
[18:48] that's why the Lord decided to take
[18:49] James and Peter
[18:56] and he led them to the top of the
[19:00] mountain
[19:01] there was a reason for that
[19:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen.
[19:07] &gt;&gt; Uh the more you go higher,
[19:11] &gt;&gt; the more you grow taller.
[19:16] &gt;&gt; And when they reach the mountain,
[19:21] um there appeared Moses
[19:25] &gt;&gt; and Elijah
[19:28] &gt;&gt; because they were now on top.
[19:33] Now where when they are on top
[19:36] the only visible thing was supernatural
[19:45] as you go beyond the seven churchages
[19:50] so you come to the top
[19:55] then it's supernatural
[20:00] amen
[20:02] for it really changed the three
[20:04] witnesses.
[20:09] Amen.
[20:10] &gt;&gt; And uh and Peter later said
[20:16] we are eyewitnesses.
[20:20] Amen.
[20:22] &gt;&gt; We were with him
[20:24] on the holy mount.
[20:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. They seen the
[20:31] &gt;&gt; supernatural
[20:35] Genesis 18.
[20:39] &gt;&gt; Oh, now I was trying to say
[20:44] &gt;&gt; a young man
[20:48] is just trapped between his infancy
[20:55] and maturity.
[20:59] That's a young man.
[21:04] He cannot see like an old man.
[21:11] Amen. Uh
[21:12] &gt;&gt; at this age
[21:16] uh I will read in the Bible
[21:19] the only God he can worship is himself.
[21:26] If he is without God,
[21:29] he he will worship himself.
[21:34] I've read the magazines
[21:38] trying to see who says what and what
[21:42] says who.
[21:47] Then I realized that we we have some
[21:49] magazines
[21:53] where you find young people
[21:56] revealing their insight
[22:03] and
[22:05] I realize that this is the end of time.
[22:12] They speak of their dreams to follow.
[22:19] I have a dream to follow.
[22:25] Now dreams
[22:28] &gt;&gt; they come during the night
[22:34] the devil.
[22:37] &gt;&gt; If you
[22:39] walk around the night in the night
[22:42] that is the time the devil is also
[22:45] roaming about.
[22:49] is the prince of darkness.
[22:54] Amen.
[22:55] &gt;&gt; So now if talking about dreams,
[23:00] &gt;&gt; you are talking about night time.
[23:04] &gt;&gt; During the day,
[23:07] five senses active.
[23:11] &gt;&gt; When you go to sleep,
[23:14] &gt;&gt; your nervous system system
[23:19] shuts.
[23:20] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Such off.
[23:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:22] &gt;&gt; So the subconscious
[23:26] &gt;&gt; takes over.
[23:28] &gt;&gt; That's when you start to dream.
[23:31] That's right.
[23:33] &gt;&gt; Now sometimes the dreams
[23:37] they are coming from
[23:41] the daily happenings.
[23:47] thoughts of the day.
[23:51] You are thinking of how you'd want to
[23:54] look like.
[23:58] You are comparing yourself with some
[24:00] other people and things
[24:05] and you want to emerge as somebody.
[24:11] You want to look better.
[24:15] and dress better and
[24:19] better hairstyle and all.
[24:23] Now when you go to sleep
[24:26] now the channel
[24:30] opens up.
[24:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. And uh what do you call that
[24:38] channel
[24:40] &gt;&gt; inside
[24:42] the subconscious
[24:44] &gt;&gt; channel subconscious
[24:46] &gt;&gt; channel subconscious.
[24:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:49] &gt;&gt; Then tomorrow
[24:53] he or she will say I've got a dream
[24:58] to follow.
[25:00] He's a young man or a young woman.
[25:04] He's just looking at a mountain.
[25:07] He doesn't see or she doesn't see the
[25:09] other side
[25:12] of the mountain.
[25:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:17] &gt;&gt; And uh so now
[25:19] uh because if there is this side
[25:24] and uh and the top side
[25:28] that's where you can see both sides.
[25:32] Amen.
[25:33] Amen.
[25:34] &gt;&gt; And you can say I was blind.
[25:38] Now I can see
[25:41] all right.
[25:43] &gt;&gt; I was a sinner,
[25:46] &gt;&gt; but now I'm no longer a sinner.
[25:54] Brother Gama taught me something in
[25:57] Zulu.
[26:01] the word saying
[26:08] walk towards a rock.
[26:09] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[26:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:11] &gt;&gt; That means
[26:16] a plowing
[26:18] &gt;&gt; towards
[26:20] a rock.
[26:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:25] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[26:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:28] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[26:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. Because if you can't see the other
[26:31] side
[26:33] then
[26:38] you are plowing towards the rock. Amen.
[26:41] &gt;&gt; Okay. Amen.
[26:42] &gt;&gt; So I was trying to read something here.
[26:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[26:46] &gt;&gt; Amen. You know there was Einstein
[26:50] Einstein
[26:51] &gt;&gt; um
[26:54] doing his probings
[26:58] &gt;&gt; and he came to a place where he
[27:02] he said things like this
[27:07] &gt;&gt; that there is a place
[27:11] &gt;&gt; where all things came from.
[27:17] Amen.
[27:18] &gt;&gt; It's Albert Einstein.
[27:20] &gt;&gt; Albert Einstein.
[27:22] &gt;&gt; He has seen that
[27:25] &gt;&gt; he he studied the law of light.
[27:30] &gt;&gt; So he followed this.
[27:35] Then the prophet of God
[27:38] &gt;&gt; when he saw that
[27:40] &gt;&gt; then he said
[27:44] &gt;&gt; Einstein
[27:46] &gt;&gt; Einstein
[27:47] &gt;&gt; uh his experience
[27:50] &gt;&gt; only if it was supernatural
[27:56] &gt;&gt; spiritual
[27:59] &gt;&gt; it would help.
[28:03] But now if it is only physical,
[28:09] it doesn't help
[28:12] because he has a scope.
[28:15] He uses his advanced scope.
[28:20] He is the only one seeing that.
[28:26] Now the other person down there
[28:29] has to rely on his experience.
[28:36] But he he hasn't seen it.
[28:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.

[38:32] teachers.

[38:37] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[38:38] &gt;&gt; Why? Because
[38:40] &gt;&gt; let me say tell read something to you
[38:44] &gt;&gt; now. Now, now you listen to this man and
[38:46] his son.
[38:49] Second Timothy
[38:52] chapter 2 verse 22
[38:54] verse 22.
[38:55] &gt;&gt; Flee flee also youthful lusts.
[39:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:02] &gt;&gt; You know the youthful lusts.
[39:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:09] &gt;&gt; And uh when they come to that age
[39:14] They have youthful lusts.
[39:21] &gt;&gt; I found one
[39:24] in a court
[39:29] having accused his mother
[39:35] saying
[39:36] &gt;&gt; my mother has kicked me out of the
[39:38] house.
[39:41] Amen.
[39:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. I think the brother was there. I
[39:45] don't know whether he's here.
[39:48] I was just in that place.
[39:52] &gt;&gt; And the mother says
[39:55] he comes
[39:58] uh maybe in the middle of the night
[40:00] home.
[40:02] He wants to do whatever he wants to do.
[40:06] If I talk to him, he says then I'm
[40:09] going.
[40:11] &gt;&gt; Then I said, Well, if you want to go,
[40:13] go.
[40:15] Now, today he says I kicked him out.
[40:20] Amen.
[40:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:21] &gt;&gt; And I said, what a waste of time.
[40:24] &gt;&gt; The BI the Bible says
[40:30] children,
[40:32] &gt;&gt; honor your
[40:34] mama and your daddy.
[40:39] Amen. Amen.
[40:42] And the Bible also
[40:47] don't mention this to the police.
[40:50] &gt;&gt; The Bible said
[40:52] &gt;&gt; spare the rot
[40:55] spoil the child.
[40:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:02] &gt;&gt; Okay. Amen.
[41:04] &gt;&gt; Spare the rod.
[41:09] Amen. But the people rights came and
[41:13] said
[41:16] he's got this child has got the rights.
[41:22] &gt;&gt; Which rights?
[41:25] Because if it's not parental rights,
[41:29] if it's not God's rights,
[41:33] no which rights,
[41:37] &gt;&gt; you get what I mean?
[41:39] &gt;&gt; Then that's why
[41:41] He comes 12:00
[41:44] believing that it's his rights.
[41:48] That's right.
[41:50] False and evil rights that leading him
[41:54] to doomsday. To the doomsday.
[41:59] Amen.
[42:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:01] &gt;&gt; All right.

[42:12] our right mind.
[42:17] Amen.
[42:19] Amen.
[42:21] &gt;&gt; Without the creator,
[42:24] &gt;&gt; you are not in your right mind.
[42:29] I can prove that to you.
[42:33] You know, amen. That's why the Bible
[42:37] speaks of the thoughts of your heart,
[42:44] &gt;&gt; not your five senses.
[42:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:49] &gt;&gt; Is that so?
[42:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[42:52] &gt;&gt; That's right.
[42:53] &gt;&gt; Your five senses.
[42:56] &gt;&gt; Okay. I'm looking at the clock. I must
[42:59] close here.
[43:01] But I was trying to say something here.
[43:05] &gt;&gt; Let me read it to you.
[43:08] &gt;&gt; That is
[43:10] the father coming to Abraham.
[43:16] &gt;&gt; Who was childless.
[43:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[43:22] &gt;&gt; And uh
[43:26] verse 10,
[43:27] &gt;&gt; Genesis 18:10.
[43:30] And he said
[43:32] that is God said, "I will certainly
[43:35] return unto thee according to the time
[43:37] of life.
[43:41] And lo Sarah, thy wife shall have a
[43:43] son."
[43:46] And Sarah had it in the tent door which
[43:49] was behind him. Hallelujah.
[43:55] Now Abraham and Sarah were old and well
[43:57] stricken in age.
[44:01] And it sees
[44:04] to be and it ceases to be with Sarah
[44:08] after the manner of women.
[44:14] &gt;&gt; H therefore Sarah left laughed within
[44:17] herself saying after I have become old
[44:20] shall I have pleasure with my lord my my
[44:23] my lord being old also.
[44:32] And the Lord said unto Abraham,
[44:33] "Wherefore Sarah left, saying, Shall I
[44:36] of sorry bear a child whom I'm old?
[44:44] Is anything too hard for the Lord?
[44:49] At the time appointed, I will return
[44:51] unto thee according to the time of life,
[44:54] and Sarah shall have a son.
[45:00] Okay.
[45:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[45:02] &gt;&gt; As we were trying to show that
[45:05] &gt;&gt; something here, but then let's read
[45:08] something because we I must
