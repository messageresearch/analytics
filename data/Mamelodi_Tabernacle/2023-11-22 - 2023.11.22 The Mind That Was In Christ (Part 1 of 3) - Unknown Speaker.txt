========================================
[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Laughter] oh [Music] glad that I met Pastor Paul I'm glad to meet and I want to say to I want to say God bless Pastor for making possible for us to [Applause] [Music] [Applause] me and we are I have [Applause] known T we have two bless you and we thank God for the service [Applause] tonight iess so the Lord bless you uh since I met Pastor Paul so we will meet time and again [Applause] we believe that God will lead us on until [Applause] the now since we is our first time maybe to meet here on Earth we should start where we met before and because is the time of [Applause] recognition those who were together before are now together again [Applause] and brother says now this is our last [Applause] Gathering all of [Applause] coming all [Applause] coming and all for the of we are heading for the Battle [Applause] of soldiers out of the seven [Applause] churches those he knew [Applause] before so as we turn to the book [Applause] Philippians chapter 2 verse 5 let us pray Heavenly Father we are thankful again another great time for our souls we thank you for the opportunity to meet your people your subject and we thank you for the p in this [Applause] building and we thank you for the word that is that will come our way this evening bless every brother and in English it say let this mind be in you which was also in Christ [Applause] [Music] Jesus bless the mind that was in Christ mind in [Applause] stages the prophet says started being an attribute [Applause] then it was the attribute became a [Applause] word became a [Applause] man the prophet says to God wanted to Fellowship [Applause] but now he realized that the only thing he could fellowship with was his mind but then he had to bring that mind into some beings and [Music] with his mind so what what we worship God today is the mind of God made [Applause] as as in the Bible we read that the Lord Jesus said the true [Applause] [Applause] worship now brother here I will read this part from Christ is the Myster of go Christ is revealed in [Applause] his now he says the body has hands starting from the feet to the eye [Applause] and he Likens that to the seven Church [Applause] ages then he says the last the next thing is the head which is the [Applause] inell now he says we are in the head [Applause] time mind operates from the head now he says this is the intelligence which who controls the whole body because he says beyond the eye there is no [Applause] mov so it sends you to the seven [Applause] seal that there is no motion there is no moving [Applause] motion so when the seven seal was open all was now there it needs [Applause] intence because it's something that people cannot see now it [Applause] takh to speak when all is silent [Applause] says in the book [Applause] [Music] [Applause] of of God lays beneath the seven [Applause] SE now because heaven [Music] is now from the head to the heart [Applause] now the head is above the and the Heart ISE the [Applause] head now says theer [Applause] of is [Applause] the now we realize the heart is in the body now the bride is the body of [Applause] Christ the heart is in the [Applause] body the mystery is from the mind of God their so now if I read um this mind that was in Christ we will read a bit here about it [Applause] the mind that was in Christ now it say that mind be you he says no longer in mind now we open the [Applause] books we I have the book here Souls that are in prison um it [Music] says now says the soul of men is not the body [Applause] of the body has five of has nothing to with something from the [Applause] body just as the seven is something from church [Applause] so now as we have the seven churches and the Seven [Applause] SE we have a man the man and the Soul [Music] we so each of these two [Applause] [Music] [Music] people that's why we have the ministry of theeven chur [Applause] one is is Earthly the other one is [Music] spiritual body the soul that's the nature of the [Applause] spirit body each of these persons has his own [Applause] nature now the prophet says when the B says [Applause] we are INR [Applause] is not [Applause] your it wasn't the that died it wasn't the spirit that died it was the nature of of your spirit it's the nature of your because the prophet says when a mother he says uh it is the she delivers a body [Applause] and when she delivers a body there's a spirit waiting for that body while the child the wom of the mother it's not living they hear the movements theing the not come into the body the body is in [Applause] the life is breing outside as soon as the body is delivered then he says then that little Spirit comes [Applause] in and there was a spirit that stes of you have three stages the first the body is delivered secondly comes into the and the prophet says that is the Angel of the that is theel of the and when this little angel comes into the body when this little angel or this Spirit comes into the body but he says now this is a child born born on but later the word of God comes to this [Applause] child he the way he hears the of God and he says now he must make that's where predestination comes in he says when the child makes this choice [Music] [Applause] ites then when this happens then you see the angel of the Lord now comes [Applause] in now the first Angel of the earth came the then [Applause] you he says now when you make a decision another this is the Angel of the Lord for First Corinthians say is the the first man is of the [Applause] [Music] earth is the Lord From Heaven says this shows you predestination because he says now this body that comes it's not a that's Eternal the first one is not [Applause] etal and ET now that's why as we on [Applause] it was the nature of your spirit that [Applause] di says we in he says and and uh that is the soul the nature of your spirit the soul [Applause] di but if you are born again then your the nature of your spirit is God that's are born again you receive [Applause] another it the new s that means as a Christian you receive a new the first one [Applause] the said [Applause] when there was no one to K the ground [Applause] Genesis now he could not the ground he could not find somebody to k a ground the only man he had was [Applause] so as the prophet T that he had to bring Adam down into a body of [Applause] dust amen amen because the garden is all the ground now to [Applause] theard made of the ground man could also not the ground until God into that man the pr of life and that's why the prophet says that's when he brought the into the body then he became a living soul [Applause] that's why said to him thou shall not eat from that tree because the soul is all the as God not say to a [Applause] heaven the nature he gave that Spirit the Earthly nature that and said shall notat from this [Applause] Tre because he gave him nature amen that's why the day you receive the heaven you start to eat from the Tree of Life Now The Prophet continues the first was made a because the Bible says Adam was first formed and the woman after [Applause] so the first until he was put in the garden and the prophet after he his [Applause] own after he made in His image because the woman appeared only in [Applause] the all God put if we read the Bible you realize [Music] that let me just read a [Applause] bit Book of Genesis we will read chapter [Applause] amen now4 it says these are the generations of the [Applause] [Music] heavens when they were created in the day that the Lord God made the earth and the heaven [Applause] and every of the field before it was in [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] the so before the was [Applause] the made before [Applause] they there was no to the ground so God kept things to himself a me to [Applause] it say there was no man to open [Applause] the but it shows you that God will always look for a man as when there was no to the ground do something about until he find that man he he took that man in His image into the [Applause] body am now no again there was at the end now in Genesis there was no to K the ground in Revelation there was no man to open the seat because the of always a [Applause] man the manifestation of the of God [Applause] before the word is made comes into a man a [Music] prop am
