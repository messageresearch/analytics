Description:
Funeral Service of Sis Portia Shongwe
Title: Departure
Preached by Elder Peter Skosana on 25 October 2024 at Daveyton Etwatwa

Mark 8: 34-38 | 

The purpose of the sermon was to show the audience about the departure.

The life of Christianity is divine and is not for everyone but for the predestinated. You can never worship God without denying yourself.

When you deny yourself, you need to fight.
When you try to save your life, you will lose it. Your life is your soul, and you cannot keep your soul. It is God who can keep your soul. A life without God and the word of God is a lost life.

An ark is the type of a human heart. God created a place in a human heart where He comes to when He wants to relax.

Your body is not yourself. Your body is where your soul dwells. A human heart is an ark or dwelling place of God.

The most valuable thing that you have is your soul. If you can lose your life to Christ, He will keep it in everlasting life.

If God can give you a natural life, He can also give you a spiritual life. If God can give you the first birth, He can also give you the second birth. You cannot depart and go where you don't know. As a man you need a spirit that will make you a new person. 

The real Christian principle is based upon resurrection. Christianity is in resurrection always.

will wanting to greet you all in the name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen amen there's one thing I I've learned in life you can be as good as you can or in anything thing you saying in life there will other people that we will appreciate you are saying and others will not appreciate even if there's no reason but that is natural so um here to stand to welcome I nor house so we are together supposed to [Music] stand before I just want to say something about sister was a stonch message believer he believed this message until to her departure I remember when I started to communicating to her it was last year December when we were preparing the convention and then the last uh moment I had communication with her was telling me that we are ready for the convention again this year then I say my sister we are going to the convention so today she is another convention amen I want to say something I don't know whether it will be acceptable or not but let me just say Amen there was a certain one amongst [Music] us money [Music] for and so for can be one or two or three people I have something as a surplus in my pocket amen so I said to that individual I have a sister David Tony is the family of I convention amen so I got the money truste to pay for the convention after that the sister departed so what I'm trying to say then I said because our sister has departed we'll just take that little fun and put for him funeral because he is in another convention beyond the sky amen so I really appreciate that individual I don't have to mention name and then to come and support our sister one [Music] of should not stop should continue take the lead in the house bring up the the kids your wife has left you with we are there as the church to support and may God richly bless you as we stand to our feet to welcome our Elder in the house God bless you amen [Music] [Applause] [Music] uh uh I would like to greet you all in the precious name amen it's one of those days again and then we also want to greet the family and both families in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ and the neighbors too and the friends too and everybody that has gathered here we are grateful not for the but for the Lord that has preserved us both physically and spiritually when I saw I thought I give him to give us a word now because he's excited about his journey to l possibly doesn't want to spoil his message so don't say this this old man is so greedy yesterday he was preaching and today there's another preacher it's him who said no may the Lord bless you uh let's read the word of God and again I want you to remind me whenever the H arrive please don't be afraid to tell us that now the time has come may the Lord bless you can we read from the book of Mark uh chapter 8 us to read from verse 34 to 38 The Book of Mark 8 verse 34 to 37 and when he had called the people unto him with his disciples also he said unto them whosoever will come come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me for whosoever will save his life shall lose it but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospels the same shall save it for what shall it profit a man if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul or what shall a man give in exchange of his soul whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my wordss in this adulterous and sinful generation of him also shall the son of men be ashamed when he cometh in the glory of his father with the Holy Angels Hallelujah can we bow our heads gracious Lord we are together again father with the purpose of serving thee in all our uh Gatherings father we always invite you knowing that father your presence will always be sufficient for us amen we we are gathered here Lord as your seed and father as your offsprings amen and as your children Hallelujah we pray Lord Almighty that in Moment Like This may you always love Lord run before us or carry us Lord to your shoulders gracious Lord because thou are the breasted one Hallelujah as we have read the word father is the only comfort the one that can console this family not only this family yeah and everybody that has gathered here amen thank you Father for we pray in the precious name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen am you may be seated God okay mine is just to bring some words of comfort we know that as a human being you will never be you will bring we will never bring sufficient words of comfort that is why I'm reading the Bible and the other thing that I want to explain is that we have some Believers that we're fellowshipping together with our sister which would have liked to be in this fun but because it's during the week they couldn't make it but we have our friends here who are liveing we know people always are are getting surprised why we have to preach in English it's it's because there are some other people in different places that fellowship with us that don't understand our languages amen amen so it's just that to explain to those that don't understand but as for sister yes she was a saint indeed she loved to be at the service I remember we we we always encourage those that they have got some few sense to at home but she didn't like it she always want to come to the service even if we say we'll get you some data and but she prefers to come to the she had that Zeal within her okay fine so uh we've just read the scripture here the first verse that we read it says and when he had called the people unto him with his disciples also he said unto them whosoever will come after me let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me the life of Christianity it's divine and it's not for everybody it's it's for those that are predestinated there are are some people that says to be a Christian is a boring life but some of us you see we are great headed but I started fellowshipping when I was still very young I never get bored so it's one thing that can keep you so that's why the Bible you deny yourself right amen and take up his cross and follow him so uh you can never worship god without denying yourself because there is your natural self and when you deny yourself you deny your natural self and take the Divine Life and when you divine yourself I mean when you when you deny yourself it's a challeng now when I'm denying himself I have to deny the nature of because the nature of it's contrary to the nature of God it's not Divine so I have to fight that is why now when you you you take your cross you know our Lord Jesus Christ just pointed Peter he said follow me he never question him he denied himself and left his father his mother children wife and followed him he said to Jesus what am I going to gain in following you then he said to him you will sit in a throne judge are we together now when he ask him that question uh he was not confused he could see that there's a power in this man see that there's a pool in this uh Elisha one day was plowing Elijah just came and touch didn't say just touch and dropped everything sort at all his cows and let people eat the Flesh and he followed El because there was a pool that was there was a supernal pool Divine pool is another better life Hallelujah then verse 35 says for whosoever will save his life shall lose it you hear what he says whosoever want to save his life shall lose it now if you want to save your life know that youve already lost but whosoever shall lose his life for my sake and the gospels the same shall lose it I the same shall save it now you lose your life in order to save it and then once you try to save your life then you're going to lose it I don't know whether we are together don't try to save your life lose your life lose your life and what is your life your life is your soul you can keep your soul it's God that will keep your soul when God gave you a soul it was for his place it was not yours it was God's soul but when you were born you were born with a natural soul soul a soul was never created a soul comes directly from God are we together but now Soul the nature of and I always say that I always repeat that that you will never find kosana in any other dimension except this Dimension so the Bible says there will be the end of the world when he says the end of the world it means that's the end of the nature of that will be the end of the nature of if you want to keep it then you won't be able to save it are we together for whosoever shall gave his life shall lose it now one can say now I don't want to lose my life you know what is your life your life is the word of God and life with God I mean a life without God it's a lost life a life without the word of God it's a life that has been and then he says in verse 36 for what shall Prof what shall it profit a man if he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul you see how is it you can gain the whole world but it will never profit you you gain the whole world and lose your soul then you have lose a place because there's a type here I'm I'm reading a quote it says the ark is a type of a human heart which means your heart is an ark of God right amen it's a hidden place for those that don't understand let me re explain that you your body is not yourself [Music] your body is where your soul dwells and you've got a spirit within you which comes from God and you've got a soul within you also comes from God this body comes from the ground it's from the soil amen it's a dust are we together it's just you're just an animal the body that you were wearing the difference is that now God gave us a soul an animal hasn't got a soul so the difference between you and a dog is that you've got a soul but without the soul the same as a as a dog I'm I'm not trying to insult you I'm I'm showing you how important is your soul that is why here the Mark says there what shall it profit a man he shall gain the whole world and lose his own soul that's why the Bible says I will write my laws in their hearts where I put them in the tables of their heart showing that will be a Dwelling Place of God in other words the human heart is an ark it's a dwelling place for God Mark 387 says or what shall a man give in exchange of his soul there's nothing that you can give in exchange of your soul that is why that place it's a it's God's place you can lose whatever you have but as long as you give over your soul and you lose it to Christ you lose it to Christ then you gain it then it's a gain once you lose your soul to Christ eternity then your place is eternal are we together am now it says in verse 38 ver 38 whosoever therefore shall be ashamed of me and of my words of my weight one day the Pharisees came to him and said what should we do in order that we should keep the word you know in order that we should be perfect you read it it's in John 6:29 69 then he said the only thing that you need to do very simple you just listen to the one that I have sent you listen to the send one the one that is send then that's all because I send people I sent human beings to come and speak to human and I became a human being and speak so that why the Bible says if you get ashamed of me as the sand one and of my words then he says now the life is in the word like I've read yesterday night that the words he says the words that I speak they are alive see the words that come from him they are life now this scripture these verses that we have read the prophet of God says he says God puts it in all four gospels and then he he calls them very important scriptures he says you'll find it in Matthew you'll find it in Mark you'll find it in Luke and you'll find it in John these are important words emphasized say this scripture is important God puts it in all four was so important he says you you get you you even get it six times in the Bible in the gospel six time saying uh whosoever shall save his life shall lose it how it will amen now the most valuable thing that you got is your soul the most valuable thing that you it's your soul and if you lose your soul to Jesus in other ways you believe in Jesus then you have kept it he's going to save it to everlasting life right now those that don't understand they say sister sh is dead those that understand they say sister sh has departed right and we said yesterday when somebody departs people call it death death we don't call it death we call it a resurrection we already we already jump to check where he is according to the promise the promise says if you depart from this Dimension you go to a better Dimension and if you get out of this body you go to another body and if you get out of this world you get into another are we together so now according to the word of God she's in another place where she don't have to eat you don't have to eat you don't have to wake up and go and work she a better place there's no one are we together amen it's a place where you rest and wait you wait for the resurrection that is why when they say he she is dead we say she has resurrected we we look at the resurrection because the the the the the resurrection started the way she the day she gave her life over that was the resurrection Soul resurrected it shifted from that of a family to that of divine shifted from the position I mean physical father and the Divine father shifted from the physical life and then got the Divine Life are we together amen now that shows that was the first if God can give you a natural life he can give you also spiritual life are we together amen if God can give you a first birth God can also give you a second the first birth is when you were born by your family you're born by your parents but that's not all then you need the second bed now when you get the the birth of your parents ends up in this box all your parents are there your great parents and your great great parents that is the birth of your parents but the Divine B it's eternal are you together the Divine Life is eternal that's what we need to concentrate on that's what she taught her children that's what she fought for the Divine Life not this temporal one here we are here temporary but there's a time where we are going to depart whether you like it or everybody is going to depart there are those that knows where are they going there are those that are not sure there are those that don't care say if there's Heaven it's up to that heaven if there's hell it's up to that hell I am still enjoying myself but now that is not the way of living the way of living is to sit and meditate about yourself about your journey you grown up know that one day you want to depart you can never depart and go where you don't know our our parents and our grandparents they say when you depart you're going to meet uh your ancestors I'm not a critical person but I put it very soft forget about that there there's nothing like ancestors foret about that God created start creating you he canot give you another ancestral life gave you his own life are we together so in a very simple and humble way forget about it as a man you need a spirit that will make you a new person that's what we called born again or reborn first birth brings a natural man on Earth second birth uh it brings a spiritual man of Heaven second bed brings a spiritual man of Heaven it changes him in other words it changes your soul from to the Eternal one but if you don't change and remain to no there's no eternity never heard about an angel never you also go and read you'll never have an angel called by your name my grandfather is I've never seen an angel called I read about Michael I read about I read about you know you call them right now there is another life and your life you've got an outward life and you've got an inward right am so so now the first death is the one that our sister has taken separating from our loved ones now let me show you that all those that had a first death where was our body where their body ended what happened to Paul N killed him EMP he killed him in a very cruel way but he killed the body what happened to Peter he was he had to go through a very very painful death until he said I want to be H crucified upside down my master and then what happened to the heroes during the first church age they were taken to the Arenas dogs while dogs were open them but they were singing Hallelujah they were singing hu what made them to sing when they were when the White Beast were coming to them they say hallelujah glory to this is just a transport now the real Christian principle is the resurrection how you that that is the Christian person Christianity in Resurrection always whenever you remember this king called hezekiel heah heah heah a prophet came to him and said mend up your ways because your time has ended the Bible says he looked at the allall he started praying he prayed and and then the the prophet came and said God has heard your prayer but he started by saying Rectify your life M up your family make sure that everything is right now the prophet says God can change his mind if you commit yourselfto him because the Bible says uh with the first man if you read First Corinthians chapter 15:22 for as in Adam all die see in Adam all die so in Christ shall be made alive because in Christ it's a quickening spirit Spirit that quickens you you'll never be sorry about wherever she is now she's not sorry wherever she is there is that thing at at times like the young sister was saying the mother was saying this and this she had that concern about us as a family when you depart it's only then that you'll see that was not my family because now you are in another F two types of family there's a natural there a supernatural and when you depart you go and meet your family this family the natural one when you are here got the nature of the earth you worried about your children when I depart what are they going to going to take care of but cross over you see you will see that your children are not your children your parents are not your I don't say you disrespect them but when you are in Earth that is the nature of of year on but once you cross over you know Jesus Christ when he was on the cross he said to Mary who was supposed to be his mother he said woman behold your son he show he showed him John in other words say no you are not my mother now don't go and tell your mothers that they are not your mothers they are your mothers but I'm just showing you the the the supernatural life there's a scripture I'm not going to read it I'm going to coach it's in Matthew 28 verse 20 verse 20 you know when deaths come we always think about life after death we don't we don't we don't start crying well of course it's like this when when somebody like your parents like your friend like a family member if one passes on naturally is that thing in your heart that you cannot hold yourself it's good it's supposed to be like that when Steven was was was was murdered then they the the disciples were were were were were taken up they went and bury him they they cried they cried but they were the disciples and and the apostles but there is that natural feeling then after that then consider who are you think about life after death things about the other dimensions then the scripture that I wanted to read is uh you must just tell me when they've arrived it says Matthew 28:20 have got it my brother amen okay I'll read it here teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you and L I Am With You Always even until the end of the now such promises look what he says be with you all way up to the end of the world there's no part where you will miss me I am always with you that's the person that you will not lose you will never lose you so now I'm saying that to to her children Jesus Christ says firstly you should be taught to observe all things that he has commanded us to all the safer part if You observe all things and then he says I am he doesn't say I will be he says I am with you all the way all the way so now even if your mother is departed but there is somebody that is with you must know even the end of the world right yesterday I was telling you about changing the dispensation that now when you change from one dispensation to another that's where the power is that's where the power is oh thank you thank you so now if you change from one dispensation of your of your uh human blood dispensation and change to the super Supernatural that's where the power is those are the few way that I wanted to encourage the family encourage the friends encourage everybody that may the Lord bless you okay let's bow our head and thank God can you pray for us for it's a relevant word for this time amen uh I'll give over to our Deon may the Lord bless you amen [Applause] say program from [Music] here they can actually go and and then from thereport and then so family and then just a song and two and then we'll be going God bless [Music] [Applause] you oh we [Music] Ohana oh we [Music] oh [Music] we [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] you [Music] [Applause] [Music] do h [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] amen amen
