[1:37:33] even
[1:37:42] no man knows
[1:37:45] even the angels of heaven
[1:37:49] but I think
[1:37:51] we have found it in the book
[1:37:54] s
[1:37:57] the Seven Seals
[1:38:00] because the prophet spoke of it that
[1:38:03] when
[1:38:05] the seventh was opened because
[1:38:14] we cross all quiet in heaven
[1:38:20] and
[1:38:21] the Hops stopped
[1:38:24] playing China
[1:38:28] amen amen
[1:38:31] and he says because the angels of heaven
[1:38:38] could not understand
[1:38:44] why because
[1:38:48] the men mood
[1:38:51] is coming back again
[1:38:56] to take his position yeah
[1:39:03] and according to this word here yeah
[1:39:07] he was positioned in the third
[1:39:10] um
[1:39:22] limo
[1:39:24] now according to this threefold
[1:39:27] revelation of God yeah
[1:39:31] did you realize that
[1:39:34] man
[1:39:37] which position
[1:39:41] was give is given for the man
[1:39:44] [Music]
[1:39:47] um
[1:39:54] um
[1:39:56] while you don't know which position
[1:39:59] somebody knows he's the third um
[1:40:05] all right amen now I I read this party
[1:40:12] which says hearing
[1:40:14] um
[1:40:16] the first was identified
[1:40:23] speaking of the
[1:40:25] foreign
[1:41:01] each
[1:41:02] I wonder if somebody can say Lord we
[1:41:04] don't know
[1:41:08] is that Thomas who said we don't know
[1:41:11] okay energy
[1:41:15] how can we know where you are going

[1:41:22] I am the way
[1:41:28] if you don't know the way it was
[1:41:30] activity I am the way
[1:41:32] the Lord said to Thomas truth
[1:41:40] amen amen
[1:41:43] so Jewel was saying to him
[1:41:49] this way
[1:41:53] is a human is in a human is is made

[1:42:02] amen amen because
[1:42:06] Thomas said maybe he he would give him a
[1:42:10] location

[1:42:30] the truth
[1:42:36] I am alive
[1:42:40] amen amen only these things were made
[1:42:43] flesh amen
[1:42:49] the third is properly
[1:42:51] identified
[1:42:57] identified by whom even
[1:43:04] that question can be identified by whom

[1:46:52] the second to us rebuking the
[1:46:55] organizations

[1:47:26] anymore
[1:47:33] all right amen

[1:47:49] paragraph 219. more El paragraph from
[1:47:52] 290 but look
[1:47:54] at that one that went last level fellow

[1:48:05] um
[1:48:14] you know they said where is your wife
[1:48:17] and he said but you never really
[1:48:25] he calls this one the third messenger
[1:48:34] uh we should know that
[1:48:36] we're talking about the wage
[1:48:40] then
[1:48:42] it says the Samaritan woman
[1:48:45] she was waiting for that word to
[1:48:48] materialize
[1:48:51] to be made
[1:48:54] flesh little even now
[1:48:58] uh that's why people are so confused
[1:49:01] today
[1:49:03] confused silicone because if the weight
[1:49:06] is not made
[1:49:08] freshly the remote you hear one saying
[1:49:12] this is the other one saying
[1:49:18] it should not be the knowledge of the
[1:49:20] people
[1:49:23] it should be the word made flesho
[1:49:30] that's why and
[1:49:34] they ended up with Bible schools
[1:49:40] you know if the weight is
[1:49:43] it's not made flesh is
[1:49:51] but if you are predestinated
[1:50:00] foreign foreign
[1:50:34] I know sometimes we we talk about these
[1:50:38] things
[1:50:39] everybody can say that pool
[1:50:42] second pool first pool third pool yeah
[1:50:51] [Applause]
[1:50:52] it's a man
[1:50:56] and he said what was he
[1:50:59] what kind of a Ministry did he have
[1:51:07] foreign
[1:51:11] [Music]
[1:51:29] amen
[1:51:31] not just a letter in the in the book is
[1:51:40] a remote amen
[1:51:43] the weight was made flesh
[1:51:46] destroy the prophet says people is just
[1:51:50] away you normally in Japan
[1:52:11] son you see amen
[1:52:15] summary
[1:52:18] she has had people preaching about the
[1:52:21] world
[1:52:27] but she was waiting for it to be made
[1:52:35] like today today
[1:52:38] everywhere you find preachers and
[1:52:44] amen
[1:52:48] but the conclusion yeah
[1:52:52] we were looking for the one Arena
[1:52:56] who would come
[1:52:59] and will be made
[1:53:04] dwelt among us and we saw his glory
[1:53:12] the glory of the word
[1:53:17] amen even today
[1:53:20] hey
[1:53:23] without
[1:53:24] the third pool
[1:53:28] the third pool must also be made amen
[1:53:32] this is
[1:53:35] if it is not made flesh he is the mood
[1:53:39] then we'll just be talking what is the
[1:53:42] third person
[1:53:43] it's not revealed
[1:53:46] that's why that woman
[1:53:49] when people were talking about
[1:53:59] amen I'm waiting for this scriptures
[1:54:07] ah and when it is it is made flesh then
[1:54:12] he will tell us all
[1:54:16] otherwise we are hearing nothing is the
[1:54:20] people talking about
[1:54:24] beautiful
[1:54:25] you won't know about the Third
[1:54:31] what is that
[1:54:33] the third pool or
[1:54:37] seventh seeds
[1:54:40] yes it is
[1:54:47] all right now I read
[1:54:50] that third messenger
[1:54:55] that went down
[1:54:57] the third messenger
[1:55:07] what was it kind of a Ministry
[1:55:14] he said with the elected
[1:55:19] [Applause]
[1:55:21] he knew the right place
[1:55:29] you know
[1:55:31] why they elected
[1:55:34] that's where the word will find its
[1:55:37] place amen
[1:55:43] they were elected to receive amen
[1:55:50] and
[1:55:51] to them what was taking place behind him
[1:56:01] about Sarah
[1:56:05] when he stepped
[1:56:07] oh that that that is that was the third
[1:56:10] pool in the house of yeah
[1:56:17] I think if we have
[1:56:21] a place of gathering
[1:56:26] then we need the third pool in that
[1:56:29] place
[1:56:38] fat cool in our place
[1:56:45] because without the Fed
[1:56:48] pool
[1:56:51] it's not a complete Ministry
[1:56:54] I mean
[1:56:56] without the seventh seals
[1:57:02] you're here everywhere
[1:57:04] the prophet says it is
[1:57:12] when it was revealed to the Samaritan
[1:57:15] women
[1:57:22] now in those days
[1:57:26] The Mystery of the Messiah has not been
[1:57:30] revealed
[1:57:34] one would say the Messiah is coming he
[1:57:36] said yeah but it is
[1:57:53] unlike the others
[1:57:56] she had testimony was in this manner
[1:58:00] I know that yeah
[1:58:07] others also could say the same things
[1:58:13] the difference is
[1:58:18] the prophet says we have read it last
[1:58:20] time in the book is
[1:58:25] in which book movie
[1:58:31] I won't say you are lost but I'm I'm
[1:58:33] saying okay we have read it in the book
[1:58:36] okay
[1:58:37] the future home
[1:58:42] where it says more earring let me know
[1:58:47] you are younger than me
[1:58:51] where it says
[1:58:55] was waiting for it to be made
[1:59:10] I mean
[1:59:12] you know I can
[1:59:14] quickly find the patients
[1:59:18] and
[1:59:20] page 19.
[1:59:24] the future
[1:59:26] one of the great books
[1:59:32] this woman
[1:59:34] had no representation
[1:59:39] wait let me not start here
[1:59:42] let me that way
[1:59:44] it is I'm not talking about this woman
[1:59:47] here
[1:59:49] this priest
[1:59:50] with only intellectual learning
[1:59:54] Analytics
[1:59:58] you know when Jesus would do something
[2:00:00] they would say it's a devil hey Jason
[2:00:04] because that that's what the his
[2:00:07] denomination his denomination
[2:00:10] called it is
[2:00:18] you see you can say brother brand name
[2:00:21] oh god brother Branham he's a false
[2:00:23] prophet Prophet that's what you
[2:00:25] denominated
[2:00:30] but if fella they can appear a false
[2:00:34] prophet okay
[2:00:36] for being the man of God
[2:00:43] but then your nature if your nature
[2:00:46] is against Divine Natures
[2:00:57] because that's where your nature is
[2:01:04] you don't want a prophet
[2:01:08] would put it straight
[2:01:13] you call him
[2:01:17] amen amen
[2:01:19] if you
[2:01:21] maybe one from you here
[2:01:26] would say to me

[2:02:57] as soon as we leave this place
[2:03:00] take different directions the directions
[2:03:07] foreign
[2:03:41] because
[2:03:45] we made
[2:03:47] that's right amen a predestinated person
[2:03:50] is
[2:03:56] now he is here
[2:03:58] okay amen but this little woman
[2:04:02] had nothing to present
[2:04:07] she was as filthy and dirty
[2:04:11] and she could be
[2:04:15] prostitute
[2:04:17] but notice
[2:04:19] way down in here
[2:04:29] she had a representation
[2:04:34] you come up here you see a dirty woman
[2:04:39] a prostitute but when the Lord Jesus
[2:04:43] Christ
[2:04:48] down to before the foundation
[2:04:54] and he sees this woman yes
[2:04:58] foreign
[2:05:33] picked her from before the foundation we
[2:05:37] are building
[2:05:41] amen amen
[2:05:47] we were all sinners
[2:05:55] when the Lord
[2:05:57] looked at us
[2:05:59] as we have read
[2:06:02] from that scripture
[2:06:07] God don't look at you um
[2:06:18] then he finds you
[2:06:21] that's right amen amen
[2:06:25] whoa actually I was just saying
[2:06:30] she was looking for this to be made
[2:06:33] flesh
[2:06:37] that's a revelation yeah
[2:06:41] in the beginning was the way
[2:06:43] and we were waiting for that way
[2:06:51] because when the weight is made flesh
[2:06:54] word can present itself
[2:07:09] when it is
[2:07:15] and we saw its beauty amen
[2:07:20] amen amen
[2:07:22] you know when he tells you that I have
[2:07:26] seen you before the foundation of the
[2:07:27] world
[2:07:30] that's when you see his Beauty it's
[2:07:34] beautiful
[2:07:37] and you know you are the Messiah
[2:07:43] amen amen no one I will never ever touch
[2:07:47] me like

[2:08:17] but you can't change yourself
[2:08:21] you are changed by the predestination
[2:08:27] amen working here really more
[2:08:32] I love this
[2:08:34] and she was
[2:08:37] waiting for that to be made
[2:08:44] and when it was make flesh
[2:08:48] she met that word
[2:08:57] and uh foreign
[2:09:29] happy
[2:09:45] you wish you could meet the Lord
[2:09:47] standing before
[2:09:54] but he did that only you don't know it
[2:09:57] it fell we didn't
[2:10:00] how is it
[2:10:05] okay yes sir
[2:10:09] I
[2:10:11] I'm looking at this
[2:10:14] [Music]
[2:10:16] the third yeah
[2:10:19] now the third I'm going to refer to
[2:10:22] [Music]
[2:10:23] add that day
[2:10:25] I shall know that I am in the father
[2:10:32] and you and me
[2:10:35] and I in you now death watch the face
[2:10:42] the third is say it
[2:10:51] that's not this put something in you
[2:10:57] I am the Third
[2:11:01] in the mystery of God
[2:11:05] I in you
[2:11:09] amen amen
[2:11:11] now John
[2:11:16] people but are puzzled by something here
[2:11:24] oh
[2:11:26] not knowing
[2:11:33] the prophet of God tells me
[2:11:36] foreign
[2:12:09] the that
[2:12:12] the being that will come to preach to
[2:12:16] you is amen amen
[2:12:22] because Jesus himself
[2:12:24] took the form of men
[2:12:30] of the Seed of Abraham
[2:12:33] as
[2:12:38] Abraham
[2:12:49] oh
[2:12:53] now Abraham really Abraham of the seed
[2:12:56] the Royal Sea
[2:13:00] that's why okay more
[2:13:03] if you are a seed
[2:13:07] and see this
[2:13:09] you should know the law well
[2:13:14] you should know the law
[2:13:21] the law of life
[2:13:22] [Music]
[2:13:24] in the city
[2:13:28] you plunged it
[2:13:32] out of that seat coming forth come on
[2:13:39] amen amen
[2:13:41] until
[2:13:43] it comes through the stock
[2:13:47] it takes a journey
[2:13:50] from being buried
[2:13:52] [Music]
[2:13:53] Jesus was buried
[2:13:57] up now the church changes
[2:14:02] I mean you know at the end of time
[2:14:05] and here comes the seat back again
[2:14:09] now that's why after the seven churches
[2:14:14] foreign
[2:14:48] all right amen all right let me read
[2:14:52] something but let's assume
[2:14:56] when
[2:14:58] it was all silent in heaven heaven
[2:15:01] foreign
[2:15:21] because
[2:15:23] even the son don't know you you
[2:15:25] understand
[2:15:27] because the son Jesus came in as a
[2:15:32] substitution
[2:15:39] now he's coming back again
[2:15:42] where the son is a man
[2:15:46] and when Jesus
[2:15:49] takes his place
[2:15:51] the son now comes and takes
[2:15:57] amen that's right Jesus
[2:15:59] has to go back again
[2:16:02] and as he goes back
[2:16:05] he is the almighty God
[2:16:10] he is the creator
[2:16:12] now
[2:16:22] all right amen
[2:16:25] you know yeah yeah I was reading
[2:16:28] something here I was reading something

[2:45:11] [Music]
[2:45:14] amen amen

[2:47:39] Ally
[2:47:41] you can't find the devil in touch
[2:47:48] well the devil can fight you yeah
[2:47:53] like
[2:47:55] when the Lord Jesus was crucified
[2:48:01] they thought ah now we've got you baby
[2:48:08] the Lord Jesus offered them the body
[2:48:14] as a sacrifice
[2:48:17] but not himself
[2:48:21] they couldn't kill him somebody offered
[2:48:25] them their bodies
[2:48:31] I will restore it all day
[2:48:37] it's my own doing okay
[2:48:43] I
[2:48:46] will bring it back
[2:48:50] you see amen
[2:48:53] let me finish now
[2:48:58] that was
[2:49:00] the problem
[2:49:05] sort of the king
[2:49:13] you can die in accident
[2:49:18] like but first
[2:49:22] if you are armed
[2:49:24] the Bible says you shall not see death
[2:49:31] but your body can die
[2:49:34] you yourself
[2:49:42] amen
[2:49:43] why are you finished yeah FH brother
[2:49:46] must talking brother about the squirrels
[2:49:51] there were men some people seated
[2:49:55] you know sometimes you talk to the
[2:49:58] people
[2:49:59] you see them just smiling about smiling
[2:50:03] over yes
[2:50:06] and you know they don't believe it
[2:50:10] but there's nothing they can do it's
[2:50:12] just to offer a smiles
[2:50:19] but inside they don't believe it
[2:50:26] even when they you separate now
[2:50:29] they go their way
[2:50:37] how can you
[2:50:39] you see a squirrel where there's music
[2:50:44] you see I mean
[2:50:47] hey but this summer this mama
[2:50:52] why the prophet says
[2:50:55] she didn't say it from here
[2:50:58] because with Brothers he says something
[2:51:02] spoke yes
[2:51:06] this woman also
[2:51:09] there's something
[2:51:11] something
[2:51:14] but he says when she said
[2:51:19] nothing but the truth
[2:51:24] I you know as human beings listen
[2:51:28] simple like that but to the prophet of
[2:51:32] God
[2:51:32] he said
[2:51:35] she didn't say it
[2:51:39] God spoke
[2:51:45] these other things you wonder
[2:51:47] he says Don't Fear what you would say
[2:51:54] when you'll be taken to court hello

[2:53:03] foreign
[2:53:06] [Music]
[2:53:34] Peter
[2:53:38] Peter is blessed
[2:53:40] because God used him amen
[2:53:46] to bring about the answers
[2:54:03] amen amen it is God who answers
[2:54:12] away now
[2:54:14] amen
[2:54:18] that's how because you are part of the
[2:54:21] amen
[2:54:24] the threefold

[2:55:25] when I said these things of the
[2:55:28] squirrels
[2:55:32] for the first time
[2:55:34] this ever happened
[2:55:38] upon a human being
[2:55:45] and
[2:55:48] that little
[2:55:50] humble woman yeah
[2:55:57] because
[2:55:58] she was listening to brother brothers
[2:56:03] through predestination
[2:56:06] she said
[2:56:09] nothing but the truth
[2:56:14] and brothers

[3:11:21] Adam the Lord Jesus
[3:11:24] after come around playing that role of
[3:11:27] being a man
[3:11:30] then he went back
[3:11:33] and said what shall you say then if you
[3:11:37] see the son of man go back where he was
[3:11:40] before
[3:11:42] then the prophet
[3:11:45] before really he was alive
[3:11:48] that is that light that meant Paul yes
[3:11:56] I mean I'm in yes
[3:11:59] let's repeat it
[3:12:02] when men

[3:12:09] himself
[3:12:12] two men
[3:12:15] you get what I mean that part of himself
[3:12:20] he took the form of Abraham the form of
[3:12:24] men
[3:12:25] but at the end
[3:12:29] he goes back
[3:12:32] to who to what he was
[3:12:35] now if he goes back at the time when man
[3:12:41] has to come in
[3:12:45] back to the Garden of Eden
[3:12:47] we have ready
[3:12:52] amen yes back to the Garden of Eden
[3:12:55] you know it went this way
[3:13:00] God taking his position
[3:13:03] then taking his Muslims position is
[3:13:06] coming back again
[3:13:08] that's why
[3:13:10] today today

[3:14:10] and I wanted to remind them that even
[3:14:13] the government said don't say to a
[3:14:16] person that is a witch but with me
[3:14:26] um
[3:14:35] hmm

[3:15:19] even if we can
[3:15:22] kick him out of South Africa
[3:15:25] South Africa
[3:15:27] but there is and the one is remaining
[3:15:31] of the same roots

[3:15:39] and continue me actually doing the
[3:15:42] things
[3:15:45] she has been doing
[3:15:50] you get what I mean that's right you of
[3:15:53] the roots of Abraham Abraham
[3:15:59] as the prophet says you shall do please
[3:16:12] according to the supernatural roots
[3:16:16] [Music]

[3:51:35] in this great ministry which no any
[3:51:38] other church or any denomination can
[3:51:41] follow Lord in this equal age when we
[3:51:45] are flying higher and higher
[3:51:47] father we thank you for this great
[3:51:49] revelation
[3:51:50] I remember the prophet when he said
[3:51:52] Seven Angels Came From eternity with our
[3:51:56] souls with our spirit Lord and it was
[3:51:59] when the salt was in his hands and it
[3:52:02] was a book lord and we thank you
[3:52:05] for our names were written in that book
[3:52:08] of redemption Amen in that seven seal
[3:52:11] book no man was worthy yes sir in heaven
[3:52:15] on Earth and under the Earth beneath the
[3:52:19] Earth there was no one who was waiting
[3:52:21] only the lamb but that was slain before
[3:52:25] the foundation of the earth and that
[3:52:27] lamp was manifested on Calvary God
[3:52:31] became a man walking Among Us in a form
[3:52:35] of our Lord Jesus amen today Lord you
[3:52:38] came down once again in this last and
[3:52:41] evil days that we are living in giving
[3:52:44] us that power the going home power the
[3:52:48] rapturing faith with all those seven
[3:52:51] pandas when they attacked and Lord who
[3:52:54] came down the voices John was forbidden
[3:52:58] not to write those things
[3:53:00] but about you stood every time behind
[3:53:03] this pulpit and delivering the message
[3:53:06] through our pastor we have seen many
[3:53:09] people Lord the third pool that Sita
[3:53:11] sister had his soul when brother Brennan
[3:53:14] was telling him
[3:53:15] other brothers didn't believe
[3:53:18] when God was speaking with him that what
[3:53:21] are you looking for ask what you can
[3:53:25] and the prophet says I'm here I'm
[3:53:27] looking for spirits
[3:53:29] and God said how many
[3:53:32] he says three
[3:53:34] and those squirrels came into existence
[3:53:37] that creative power and when he was
[3:53:41] testifying about it some brothers didn't
[3:53:43] believe it but you had not predestinated
[3:53:46] seat sister had to write he says this is
[3:53:50] nothing else but the truth
[3:53:51] [Music]
[3:53:53] and she asked for something that no man
[3:53:57] can give it to her
[3:53:58] even the prophet
[3:54:00] the prophet says you can ask for money
[3:54:03] you can ask for healing it can be given
[3:54:06] to you but this must come from your
[3:54:08] heart
[3:54:09] and sister Haiti says
[3:54:12] I am asking for the saving of The Souls
[3:54:15] of my sons and God gave them to heaven
