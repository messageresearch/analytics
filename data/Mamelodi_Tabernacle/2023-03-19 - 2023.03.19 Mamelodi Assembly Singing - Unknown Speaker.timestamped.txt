[55:46] foreign
[55:51] as we approach the throne of Mercy
[55:55] we invite you Heavenly Father
[55:58] we are with the great expectation this
[56:01] morning
[56:02] dear Lord God
[56:05] you know our heart desire
[56:07] in the early hours of this morning
[56:10] I was listening to the prophet when he
[56:12] said he went somewhere in the delayed
[56:16] the body of a man
[56:17] when they do the calculation they
[56:19] realize that it went only it was
[56:24] but the very same body
[56:26] is giving us problems day by day
[56:30] so far ago we call upon the divine
[56:33] intervention this morning
[56:35] that brought
[56:37] you should heal each and every one
[56:41] no wonder the prophet
[56:43] he preached about
[56:46] the demons that torments us on a
[56:48] physical reality
[56:50] is exactly that 84 Cent body
[56:54] and he came again
[56:57] he speaks about the demon that torment
[56:59] us on a spiritual level
[57:02] follow God we came to a realization this
[57:05] morning that if you don't come and speak
[57:07] to us in a special way
[57:09] you don't visit our innermost
[57:12] we are all lost
[57:14] we invite you father
[57:17] and endless list of prayer requests
[57:19] where I read this morning
[57:22] the only reason that we read this
[57:24] morning because we have tried this and
[57:26] that and realize that you won't do
[57:29] anything without the intervention of God
[57:33] Heavenly Father
[57:35] visit the heart of each and every
[57:37] individuals that brought everything to
[57:40] your attention
[57:43] because they believe in you awake
[57:46] I know many did not have that
[57:50] opportunity them written and read before
[57:52] us
[57:54] but you know their heart
[57:56] answer experience
[58:01] there are others that are streaming and
[58:03] also if not get that opportunity
[58:06] but as our precious brother my sister
[58:08] was saying this morning saying Shalom to
[58:10] those that Wonder to see me
[58:12] their prayer requests as well
[58:15] I heard in heaven
[58:17] and after the prayer this morning we are
[58:20] expecting a testimony
[58:23] what I know about you God you're never
[58:26] disappointed us
[58:27] all this prayer requests is for edifying
[58:31] the holy church
[58:33] because we know when we when you answer
[58:36] we get more anchored in the weight
[58:40] we trust you more than yesterday
[58:43] we realize that some of the diseases
[58:46] Lord
[58:47] the doctors or the physician they cannot
[58:49] heal
[58:50] but when the Great physician is here
[58:53] everything is under control
[59:06] um
[59:10] [Music]
[59:15] each and every step that we take in our
[59:19] life may it be the step according to thy
[59:23] will
[59:23] for heavenly father if we can go without
[59:26] you
[59:34] both physically
[59:37] and spirituality
[59:40] and financially Lord
[59:42] because others this morning has
[59:44] presented before thee they have wet
[59:47] problem they have financial problem but
[59:49] where can we go
[59:51] is there no power in Gilead is there no
[59:55] healing here this morning
[59:57] I believe Lord we are at the right place
[1:00:00] whatever we have presented this morning
[1:00:03] when we leave
[1:00:05] we have received already
[1:00:08] I love the word of God when it says
[1:00:11] everything and everything has been
[1:00:13] completed and done before the foundation
[1:00:15] of the world
[1:00:17] what we are doing this morning is to
[1:00:19] access only what we have granted unto us
[1:00:23] maybe when
[1:00:24] maybe healing maybe anything
[1:00:28] you know Lord we just walk upon the path
[1:00:31] and the carpet that we have prepared

[1:04:35] attacked by covet in 2020.
[1:04:39] and by the grace of God we are here
[1:04:43] after prayer I was healed
[1:04:48] hundred percent health status
[1:04:52] the doctor said that he sees nothing
[1:04:55] wrong with me as all symptoms
[1:04:57] disappeared
[1:05:07] the second one is for her daughter
[1:05:09] sister
[1:05:14] sister has been very sick from a
[1:05:17] terrible pain in her stomach
[1:05:23] there was a time when she could not get
[1:05:25] out of bed
[1:05:27] she phoned the pasta and he prayed for
[1:05:31] her over the phone
[1:05:34] and said to her that she should come see
[1:05:37] him after Sunday service
[1:05:40] Santa
[1:05:42] when we prepared for service on Sunday
[1:05:46] the pain was severe pain
[1:05:51] and I told her that the devil doesn't
[1:05:54] want her to go to the service
[1:06:00] along the way thriving
[1:06:07] to grow from pain
[1:06:27] he just looked at him
[1:06:34] and told her to touch where the pain is
[1:06:55] to touch where the pain is
[1:07:01] Pastor asked him where the pain was
[1:07:07] my daughter tried in vain to trace the
[1:07:10] way about of the pain about success hey
[1:07:19] vanished without trees
[1:07:23] she moved from severe sickness
[1:07:27] to complete healing Instinct
[1:07:34] build even from minor pains that she has
[1:07:38] been experiencing
[1:07:42] the following day she was able to go to
[1:07:45] work
[1:07:47] after being booked sick for the whole
[1:07:50] week
[1:07:53] after witnessing this great
[1:07:55] manifestation of the way
[1:08:00] I called my elder daughter who later
[1:08:03] sent us a WhatsApp message saying the
[1:08:06] great physician now is
[1:08:14] amen
[1:08:22] [Applause]
[1:08:36] [Applause]
[1:08:43] we have sister Team B and matabelo for
[1:08:47] baptism analysis
[1:08:57] foreign
[1:09:03] [Applause]
[1:09:25] [Applause]
[1:09:28] amen
[1:09:46] [Applause]
[1:09:49] I believe there's also a video that he
[1:09:52] wants to play
[1:09:54] so if the brothers are ready
[1:09:57] God bless you
[1:10:05] peace be with you
[1:10:08] uh
[1:10:10] I have been given a task
[1:10:14] that is very Lula and that is very easy
[1:10:18] costs are not going to be
[1:10:21] answering questions
[1:10:25] just make statements okay
[1:10:31] what you see there is that I have
[1:10:34] requested to
[1:10:35] announce progress update regarding the
[1:10:39] new home for mamelodi assembly yes
[1:10:51] next slide
[1:10:53] okay
[1:10:57] come around
[1:10:58] the contents life
[1:11:00] okay we're going to look at
[1:11:03] you we all know that there has been
[1:11:05] talks and you have been contributing
[1:11:07] towards the building of a new church
[1:11:16] that is the first slide okay
[1:11:19] the second slide will refer to the
[1:11:22] building funds
[1:11:26] somehow the third slide is the
[1:11:29] challenges regarding the building fund
[1:11:31] the acquisition and the construction of
[1:11:34] the new science
[1:11:41] the fourth side refers to what is
[1:11:44] planned to be done regarding one two and
[1:11:49] three
[1:11:50] um
[1:11:58] okay
[1:12:00] those that don't know and have not had
[1:12:03] the opportunity
[1:12:05] to come to when the
[1:12:08] site was being inaugurated
[1:12:45] in 2019 the church acquired that site
[1:12:50] for 900 000. it is three hectares three
[1:12:54] hectares is almost three football
[1:12:56] grounds
[1:13:05] foreign okay and when we looked at what
[1:13:10] the value of that site is today
[1:13:13] according to the valuation by the
[1:13:16] municipality in 2020 the site is now
[1:13:20] worth 2.1 million
[1:13:24] [Music]
[1:13:25] um
[1:13:32] so we are saying 2.1 million plus there
[1:13:37] is work done of fencing of the land as
[1:13:42] well as some work 2.1 million
[1:13:47] um
[1:13:52] which you will see in the photo
[1:13:56] which was about 500 000.
[1:14:05] there is security that takes care of
[1:14:09] that problem because there had been
[1:14:11] signs of vandalism
[1:14:19] and because the place is and we
[1:14:22] had heavy rains it continuously grows
[1:14:31] now that side
[1:14:34] was used as a lodge before the church
[1:14:38] bought it
[1:14:42] and because it was first roofed
[1:14:48] it bent down sometime before we bought
[1:14:50] you will see in the picture
[1:14:54] site now that is the slide
[1:14:59] can you put a case
[1:15:04] technician that's the gate yes
[1:15:10] on your left hand side
[1:15:16] that road that you see going to that
[1:15:19] bend site
[1:15:25] that is the house
[1:15:29] so that length is about three it's just
[1:15:34] over three hectares
[1:15:38] next slide
[1:15:40] okay now
[1:15:42] the building fund that has been
[1:15:45] contributed over the years back
[1:15:52] it's now standing at 10 million that 3
[1:15:56] 13 million I was told is incorrect is
[1:16:03] you can put your hands together for
[1:16:05] yourself
[1:16:06] [Applause]
[1:16:09] now part of that of the funds were used
[1:16:15] as we will explain as we go down now
[1:16:23] when you buy a piece of land
[1:16:28] you have to involve Town municipality
[1:16:31] Town planners
[1:16:35] [Music]
[1:16:36] because they do long-term planes for all
[1:16:40] the areas
[1:16:46] okay now the pastor in the office says
[1:16:50] thank you very much for making the
[1:16:52] contribution
[1:16:54] [Applause]
[1:16:58] you can imagine what the pasta says
[1:17:00] thank you
[1:17:01] [Music]
[1:17:04] an honor I guess isn't it
[1:17:09] now
[1:17:12] the two of
[1:17:16] our fellow Believers
[1:17:21] made each serious contributions
[1:17:29] like I indicated the perimeter fence was
[1:17:33] about 500 000.
[1:17:38] it came from one family
[1:17:42] [Applause]
[1:17:57] see when you do a fence you put the
[1:18:00] foundation and all those things huge
[1:18:02] contributions
[1:18:10] foreign
[1:18:42] [Music]
[1:18:50] now when you
[1:18:52] every piece of land vacant land that you
[1:18:55] see must be rezoned by government
[1:18:59] rezoning you will explain what that
[1:19:02] means
[1:19:06] the freeway is
[1:19:10] you can build anything anyway
[1:19:15] the government says
[1:19:17] School playground something something
[1:19:21] and you can just when you like it build
[1:19:23] your double story day
[1:19:29] now that road
[1:19:33] that leads into the church
[1:19:36] the government said because there are
[1:19:39] going to be many cars coming there
[1:19:44] and that road is a public road
[1:19:49] you must whiten it
[1:19:53] you see when they built a garage
[1:19:57] in a shopping center
[1:20:01] you have to widen the roads
[1:20:06] and that then they gave us I think we
[1:20:10] have three quotations
[1:20:13] and the lowest says 13 million to do
[1:20:17] that
[1:20:18] [Music]
[1:20:21] we are not Oppenheimer
[1:20:27] so that 13 million would be better if we
[1:20:30] were contributing it towards the
[1:20:33] building not just widering the road
[1:20:40] and when
[1:20:42] the officials realize that
[1:20:46] [Music]
[1:20:48] then they realize that it's going to be
[1:20:51] costly
[1:20:54] let's look at another plane
[1:21:00] now this is the proposed Way Forward
[1:21:04] [Music]
[1:21:07] a building
[1:21:09] that is a ready move in property has
[1:21:14] been identified along Lane Wood Road
[1:21:23] some of you probably know it you will
[1:21:26] see when we show it
[1:21:37] it's been used as something before and
[1:21:40] then as a church
[1:21:45] now the owner the sellers are asking for
[1:21:48] 28 they asking for 30 plus Millions
[1:21:56] it's a bit on the high side
[1:21:59] so there's talks to see whether the
[1:22:02] church can acquire it for around 26 27
[1:22:06] or so maybe even lower so available
[1:22:15] so
[1:22:17] remember that 10 million that is all
[1:22:21] already in the kitty
[1:22:25] now the decision was taken to sell that
[1:22:29] piece of land there yeah
[1:22:34] and the selling price is 2.8 million you
[1:22:37] can buy it
[1:22:41] it's in the public media property 24
[1:22:46] Gumtree and the private property and so
[1:22:50] forth you can Google it you'll find it
[1:22:52] is there
[1:22:55] 2.84 private properties
[1:22:59] and then the pastor then said I don't
[1:23:01] want my church to read about it in the
[1:23:03] paper they must hear it fast from the
[1:23:06] pulpits
[1:23:11] okay amen thank you now they are also
[1:23:17] plans
[1:23:18] to sell this building here
[1:23:25] the estimate
[1:23:27] chain is about 6 million you could get
[1:23:30] more but six million rent that's the
[1:23:33] figure the office is looking at yeah
[1:23:40] now you can see that then there is a
[1:23:42] short form of nine Millions
[1:23:47] so if if the length is sold for 2.8
[1:23:52] the change for six million
[1:23:56] to get to about 28 million there's a 9
[1:23:59] million short form or repeatedly 28
[1:24:02] million
[1:24:04] so there are discussions with the
[1:24:08] sellers to say they can push it down
[1:24:14] now remember the church is not the
[1:24:17] business it's not a PTY LTD rscc
[1:24:23] so there has to be
[1:24:25] a structure
[1:24:27] a legal structure that should buy the
[1:24:32] new entities
[1:24:40] yeah if you need the details you can
[1:24:42] check with the officials
[1:24:46] so that is almost in summation
[1:24:50] we gave you the story about the land
[1:24:53] they can plant where it is located the
[1:24:57] size what is being sold for what is
[1:25:00] happening and the challenges and the way
[1:25:02] forward in terms of making sure that we
[1:25:05] don't get there and get stuck and move
[1:25:08] forward
[1:25:23] from me but you can get clarity from
[1:25:27] the office
[1:25:42] [Applause]
[1:25:45] [Music]
[1:26:05] all right
[1:26:08] as we stand on our feet assignment to
[1:26:12] welcome our precious pastor and whatever
[1:26:18] you want to fight
