Description:
Title: The Revealed Time of The Son of Perdition II.
Preached by Pastor Israel Nkodima on 04 June 2023 at Mamelodi Tabernacle.

The Pastor read the following scripture:
Genesis 19: 27 - 28 ; 2 Thessalonians‬ ‭2: 1-7

Abraham stood where he stood before the Lord and saw Sodom burning. But when  Lot looked  he saw the blessings.

The position of a man who is in Christ is eternal,when he leaves his position he leaves a gap behind.

A person who doesn’t know Christ, he doesn’t know Satan also.

Under the threefold revelation a mediator is not needed. He become a mediator when he came to save us. But when he come as a King he is not a mediator.

Quote:63-0318 The First Seal Par 86 - 93
Quote:63-0323 The Sixth Seal Par 301

go back to these events and God is going to is going to bless us we shall follow the events tomorrow and I will reach you first these two scriptures sorry I'm not preaching you might sleep thinking that what is our title is the revealed time of the son of perdition I mean did you all hear him they revealed time firstly I will read it to you we've seen in the Bible will read more Genesis you know there's two places we we will read before we start yeah amen amen Lord it tells us about lot because we are looking at the the way our brother Abraham was looking um [Music] foreign now today I can ask you a question what do you see when you look amen amen amen um I can somebody can look um all right amen but fella we want to look amen because with this eyes [Music] all right yes if you are looking at the physical level then you will look at using your physical eyes all right amen now we want now that's why Abraham that day oh yeah it tells us that you went back to their place where he stood before them all right amen foreign I Want To Worship in a place where I can be able to see [Applause] amen amen you know now I'm going to read this yes first let me show you tell you about Lord again that is Genesis and Lord lifted up his eyes foreign [Music] and the Lord lifted up his eyes and behaved all the plane of Jordan that it was well watered that's naturally now and then everywhere before just read it brother and Lord lifted up his eyes and beheld all the plane of Jordan that it was well watered everywhere before the Lord destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah amen even as the garden of everywhere before the Lord Morena destroyed I mean before the destruction really had senior he's so nice things and you know if you are a farmer and you see uh the well what she's over here before it was destroyed I mean amen and then and then then Lord choose him all the plane of Jordan and Lord Janet East and they separated themselves the one from the Earth that's right amen after come around he has seen to tell their faces somewhere else amen amen you can only start off after you have seen come around after maybe you've seen something better then you'll start all right now but when Abraham cast his eyes in the same place looking at the very same place where is that one of us likes about everybody Genesis 19 19. mm-hmm and Abraham got up early in the morning to the place where he stood before the Lord amen and he looked towards Sodom and Gomorrah and towards all the land of the plane and beheld and load the smoke of the country went up as the smoke of a fairness who he went back to the place where he stood before the Lord amen amen also happy to view foreign but when he arrived there what happened he saw Sodom um amen that one saw a blessings what do you see when you now that's when they looked when you go around well we if you try functionality every time in again we hear the gospel preach all the time like you hear about the Lord Jesus but fella what happens when we you really look at him this is what caused me to break down he says that's when I foreign you know go back to that Revelation chapter 21 I'll show you something Revelation 21 from verse 1. and I saw a new Heaven and a new Earth for the first Heaven and the first Earth were passed away and there was no more sea and I John saw the holy city New Jerusalem coming down from God out of Heaven prepared right I mean now listen get a tillage God said in Genesis he created God created heaven [Music] now when this man of God looked at this time all right the first time it was just so dumb yeah but when he looks you see now we have gone through some things every now now we want to look at them we talked about the Battle of form again but now we are coming back again and now we are coming for to look and that's when you say when you look about it yeah you've been seeing things but there's a time when you lose okay amen gospel is not like after hearing about something and it is no it is just to say hey that message was wonderful have you seen some marijuana amen [Music] all right now I will read this part here I've got a few things it speaks of this uh this Thessalonians and now you know let no man deceive you by any means for that day shall not come except there came they come off Falling Away and you know falling away blinds the people so much Here Comes fooling away first and that man of sin be revealed well there's a time when you are talking about men of sins but yeah it is talking about the time he is [Music] you can spend many years talking about Jesus but there's a time when he is revealed to you it's different than just hearing about Jesus they revealed Jesus it's not the Jesus you've been hearing about it it is the revealed one amen that's why people hear about Jesus talk about Jesus they talk about the men of sins [Music] it tells us about it it says when he is foreign that's why you know how to go about it because if you don't know him by Revelation you can worship but at the end of it still take another one like you look at sodium and you see nice things um listen now let no man deceive you please tell us by means means for that day shall not come except there come a falling away faster meaning when that day is coming there will be a falling away [Music] and that man of sin be revealed [Music] the Son of Perdition right who opposes and exalts himself above all that's called God well I okay [Music] I mean um is that the place yes yes who opposes and exalts himself above all that is called God or that is worshiped so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God showing himself that he is God Amen remitting sins okay um look at what we where we are going let me remember remember he not that when I was yet with you I told you these things that that Paul

he can use them they can tell lies amen praising the Lord because they don't know hey so they worship they talk about Christ we've been speaking tongues but still they can do things because they don't

those things you know the the bride picks some Mysteries uh did you know that thing is so now if he is now not a media well he is because the Old Testament is closed Italy the opening of the seals he says in their openings close to the Old Testaments I mean the New Testament amen thank you thank you amen is closed uh [Music] under the Old Testament he was the blood of um [Music] all right but now we are coming today he says when the seals open up foreign okay but fella when the time he came to save us he was he became immediately there's some things all right amen under the threefold revolution he is no longer he is a king when Nick you know the subjects really but the subjects the key wash has subjects now king is not a mediator amen are you saying he's a mediator a king has some subjects bye that's the king and then he only comes to address is right amen okay now let's look at this we will follow where he says in his time this is what I'm looking at here there is a time that is called his time and now you you know what withholded that it might be revealed in his time [Music] this time foreign [Music] now if I look at this you call it the seventh year he says his time let me go back again I've got a lot of things in his time at the breaking of that day Layla right now I I let me quote against something yeah [Music] we find that the the the the sixth year has been opened to us we know about that being open to us uh we see we see it what do you see about the 60s let me stop preaching let's talk [Music] if I can could find you for you here the six years do you

and Elijah now I reaches the six seals opened um well that's a mysterious thing yeah foreign [Music] eat all right amen amen there's two prophets for the Jews and this year we have a prophet here for the Gentiles I now that's the time of um amen amen they're sixties we are coming to that where you find two prophets for the Jews but again the seventh I think we with what we call us you call us the Gentiles there's still something missing there because the angel pick him up amen amen and he tells about opening of the seventh yeah when he said I opened the seal for God [Music] people are stumbling how was the seventh open that is the secretary the secret here is the Secretary of Italy the sixes now the secret of the seventh jealous because it can't just be to the to the bride it can't just be because Nova it is not known [Music] is it not known to the price no then the bride will have the rights to save my husband why I don't know about it amen amen okay amen was responsible the introduction Isaac he came with Rebecca and Isaac came but when he saw Isaac then it was time for him to introduce Isaac now to Rebecca is but do you know what what's wrong Rebecca Rebecca by Revelation he asked who is that what did Isaac says so it was revealed the husband was revealed foreign [Music] [Music] that's when he got off the camera right I mean when are you going to get off that game yeah keep on riding even when eliasa is no longer there now where are you going now we're a guy there's a time when eliasa amen came with Revenge to the place it was like the revelation of the seventh seeds it was a man who led Rebecca we'll make a round today I have never heard of somebody reading [Music] and he says I must coach it right yes was it the seals or the seal okay this foreign all right amen did brother Brandon open the seals if you don't know don't don't know okay we'll come to to that yeah you know that's how the Rapture will come the bride has to receive a mystery a very deep mystery okay now here they see they opened that seal and then the six is open that's a mysterious thing here's the secret of it if I were to go back to standing in the gaps standing in the game it's against something else I don't know is there anyone who knows today it is like a News Bulletin yeah do you really understand what it means standing in the Gap standing in the Gap in a hurry right let's turn on the pages standing now to me it's not just a really reading it's not just for reading when it comes hey it's a standing in the game then which game now yeah standing in [Music] and it is a sermon what does that means he's not talking about something that happened back there he's standing in the game and it was proven when he received amen the Gap is of that man Adam back there Adam Adam when he forfeited the post and it belongs to men not Angel yeah you know if God were to replace Adam with something else would say God Was Defeated much but when he was defeated then Allah something else then we he passed with something Where is the the law now of reproduction restoration coming from it puts back things everything that was shifted says restoration he's taking them back just like you if you were predestinated and seals are open you are restored [Music] you a if you tell me that message I have received the message that's a good thing is they kept closed nah because when we fall Hits a game we left again that's why Adam left again the position of a man in Christ is an eternal position if you shift it lives again foreign end God wouldn't allow it to remain like that is that would signal that God Was Defeated now if you go back you find men the men again standing there now you know that was the the law of restoration that man is back there that's why you should be aware you used to be in Christ that is Resto ation not only by by word by I'm restored it must be a restoration means foreign [Applause] you no longer speak lies one day you no longer hate you are restored you are not ruled by circumstances if somebody comes and says I used to I used to give it three fella um I use like a the same after a person lives they play his place here what do they say I used to the reason the reason now imagine no not uh if you are pleased in and you tell a post we are given an eternal processary and maybe for yes meanwhile you testify I'm a Child of God my sins are forgiven ended tomorrow you tell us about your reason how amen why you left amen the reason live up Adam had a reason the woman you gave me and God knew it was with God to to forgive the woman you gave me he's the one she's the one who gave me amen now Julie but if you are saved and then you are begging Christ where's the reason coming from for living you you can't come to Christ and leave him for a certain reason because those that are in Christ have got eternal life they don't have reasons amen amen you can see the reason I'm no longer have eternal life now this standing in game is also something standing in the game can I come around again with it was the place of Adam and when God comes back with restoration then he said the prophet stood up and said standing in the gate foreign because you know of the swad yeah that was given out yeah yes and after camera they fall off Adam the law of restoration brought back a man again it should bring it should be a man it's her name is Ruby you know you are a son the Lord Jesus came as a son as a substitute [Music] as a substitute foreign is somebody who fights for a title [Applause] it's for eign he is running foreign [Music] oh let me finish here today because we were just opening what we Abraham looked one day um he stood today I am a father now as I'm saying we are here at the end of time now now Charlie uh at the end of time our Visionary Arena is starting has started back there [Music] Abraham we want to see because see Abraham Our Father has seen from the place where he stood no let me put it in the right way I mean we of the Seed of Abraham are able to see just like Abraham did you know that is [Music] and the Bible says they have seen these things do you know the scripture amen that is a Genesis chapter is it 11. who who else can tell us about the scripture uh Abraham God spoke to the Bible says Sarah also receive strength to conceived that scripture amen Genesis chapter 21. [Music] you don't have your church he Plus 11. through faith also Sarah has self-received strength to conceive sin and was delivered of a child when she was past age because she judged him faithful who had promised salaping therefore sprung there even of one and him as good as dead so many as the stars of the sky in multitude and as the sandwich is by the seashore innumerable this all died in faith not having received the promise but having seen them are far off and were persuaded of them and embrace them and confess that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth amen amen amen amen Abraham it says you know eagle has seed in England and England will see exactly like the mother um okay it is born with that no that's why now we of the Seed of Abraham and this is the last mile of the way [Music] we are going to see that now it is the vision is brighter hurry up as we are getting ready now the Seed of Abraham what it says no sir Sarah also Vienna through cartoon now if Sarah doesn't say by faith their faith already was the faith of Abraham so that's why Abraham it says it says through faith that is already existing that's why the faith is given to us that is already existence if an eagle gives birth to an eager he doesn't pray for the eaglets foreign right now when God is like that we are born Seed of Abraham only pay we are Abraham so the vision is because you are born now that's why it speaks of those born after Sarah through faith did you hear what it says concerning them they could see things [Music] this all died in faith not having received the promises but having seen them are far off yeah even if they died [Music] they died in but they died read brother this all died in faith right amen to mage carry on not having received their promises but having seen them are far off amen oh when they died they died just looking at their promises that's where we are going to all right amen now what about the Seed of Abraham when they also have that Vision seeing it's nothing for the first time that I'm told that the Rapture is foreign [Music] [Music] now see the Seed of Abraham told that the Rapture is just here that's the seed you can't say that to somebody else it should be to the seed okay I'm in now if you were to take two people already um as a you know there are people who say I can't read it when it is a house now you bring these two people together more more [Music] but this one says I can't see it amen amen and then they saw but this one but it is but this one this one says no I don't see it yeah you'll see I mean spiritually it is like that there's some people here you can see that the coming of the Lord is here but there's a there's some people they only know about it Jesus is coming but they really don't see what is happening hey yeah the people but but they have some televisions all sorts of things but yet they don't see Abraham Abraham he had a different kind of a YouTube YouTube exactly what God was doing it [Music] I wonder YouTube YouTube now I'm not talking about the natural YouTube that we we used to see things I'm talking about spiritual things your spiritual troops yes more yeah I mean how far can you see because it says look and liberella even if even it says I heard them singing I've got that song look and look you can live yeah I'm closing now look and leave Abraham Abraham Luke and

this one from Saint Francis San Francisco it's four and a half okay four and a half hours I'm I said after 16 minutes foreign it it seems as if I'm living in the end okay now that's why now I'm closing by saying I'm not through here we are not true but this flight yeah it must take us to the rapture [Music] [Applause] as but it is closed look at the signpost design post look around what is happening I was listening when somebody they were saying they said I'm saying they said America America you see worse than Sodom are you listen I was listening foreign we could get deep into these things and I remember well sometimes ago a mama or they used to say all right let me talk about myself there used to be sometimes they say the school students should go to visit and I would want I would like to know what is that is it part of the syllabus then if I realize that it is just something came to you to entertain the children and has got nothing to do with the syllabus then I would say my child is not going there I would not be rebelling against the government now if you ask help who has organized that trip foreign [Music] [Music] [Applause] there was one time children were
