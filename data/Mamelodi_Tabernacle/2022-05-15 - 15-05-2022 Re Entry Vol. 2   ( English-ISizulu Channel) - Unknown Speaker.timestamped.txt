[53:50] this morning father and we believe that
[53:53] father there are testimonies that are
[53:55] going to follow

[53:59] and the lord we want to thank the lord
[54:00] also for for the tithes and offerings

[54:30] [Applause]
[54:40] god bless you
[54:43] we read some petitions
[54:46] a few weeks ago

[55:10] there was also a petition from sister
[55:12] maserpo
[55:14] regarding some fans to be released
[55:18] and that has been sorted now
[55:25] you know the lord will always answer
[55:29] in a different way
[55:32] so
[55:33] we have a family mona family they
[55:36] brought
[55:38] a prayer request
[55:42] their brother was
[55:44] ill at the hospital
[55:47] the elders prayed
[55:49] for to me the mourner
[55:52] and the lord answered the prayers and
[55:54] the family want to thank the lord
[55:58] the brother passed away
[56:00] but is a testing
[56:02] [Applause]
[56:08] we have sister
[56:11] bakungo definitely
[56:16] the sister has a child the child was
[56:19] sick and coughing
[56:22] they took the child to the hospital
[56:25] the child was given an injection but the
[56:28] child was not
[56:29] getting any better
[56:31] so they tried to call the elders for a
[56:34] prayer
[56:36] but the phones didn't go through
[56:40] and the lord led them to brother harvest
[56:42] to pray for the child
[56:46] the child is here
[56:53] so sometimes
[56:55] when the believers call we ask them for
[56:59] the photo of the sick person
[57:02] and their full names and we send them to
[57:04] the pastor
[57:06] so but our harvest did exactly the same
[57:08] thing
[57:10] may the name of the lord be placed
[57:18] i have sister sharon tombe

[58:12] i
[58:13] also
[58:15] bring you
[58:17] unfortunate news around our body
[58:24] last week or sorry the week before last
[58:26] week there was an incident
[58:29] at the party
[58:32] one of the taxes that brought the
[58:34] believers
[58:38] stood on the road
[58:41] next to their brothers that are sailing
[58:43] through today
[58:46] of loaded passengers
[58:51] and it was not the first time
[58:54] and that
[58:56] created an incident
[59:00] which was really unfortunate
[59:07] there was a fight
[59:11] that is really not nice
[59:14] there was an exchange of weights
[59:18] and
[59:20] those people that are selling fruits are
[59:23] also the friend of pastor israel
[59:29] they only respected the driver
[59:32] because of the past
[59:35] but it was going to evolve into a big
[59:37] fight
[59:38] brother bernie my power was able to
[59:41] assist with the situation but it was
[59:44] uncalled
[59:47] but that is not the only incident
[59:50] they are reporting to me that
[59:53] we offload our families
[59:57] while we are parked inside the road
[1:00:02] that is not good
[1:00:10] the pasta
[1:00:12] will not be happy
[1:00:15] to hear that we are troubling our
[1:00:17] neighbours
[1:00:20] you know our neighbors love us so much
[1:00:22] they respect us
[1:00:25] if there is anything they call the
[1:00:26] elders
[1:00:31] let us treat them with respect
[1:00:35] let us support them let us greet them
[1:00:39] let us avoid to engage in fights
[1:00:46] our transport organizers please speak to
[1:00:49] the drivers
[1:00:51] so that they don't
[1:00:53] offload passengers while they are still
[1:00:56] in the room
[1:00:58] we don't just make you turn around the
[1:01:01] road
[1:01:02] one of the believers made a u-turn on
[1:01:04] the sidekick
[1:01:06] and he was almost involved in an energy
[1:01:09] on the same thing
[1:01:11] can we avoid that
[1:01:16] hallelujah
[1:01:19] i'm a duke and i'm supposed to say these
[1:01:21] things
[1:01:23] you know the deacons are the policemen
[1:01:25] of the church
[1:01:29] so it's not nice
[1:01:33] and that was not the only incident
[1:01:36] it was another one previous weeks
[1:01:41] they approached brother p one because
[1:01:43] one of the brothers parked their car in
[1:01:45] the wrong place
[1:01:49] and they wanted to find who and drive
[1:01:51] ours
[1:01:53] and it was not nice
[1:01:56] so let us avoid that
[1:01:58] hallelujah
[1:02:01] god bless you
[1:02:03] can we let her know
[1:02:09] next week
[1:02:11] saturday and sunday we have an outreach
[1:02:13] to swaziland

[1:40:45] as we open the scripture brother i know
[1:40:47] you've got the scripture then
[1:40:50] can you introduce that scripture to us
[1:40:56] genesis chapter 2 verse 8 to 9.
[1:41:01] and the lord god planted a garden
[1:41:03] eastward in eden
[1:41:05] and there he put the man whom he had
[1:41:08] formed
[1:41:09] and out of the ground made the lord god
[1:41:11] to grow every tree
[1:41:13] that is present
[1:41:15] to the side and good for food
[1:41:18] the tree of life also in the midst of
[1:41:21] the garden and the tree of knowledge of
[1:41:24] good and evil
[1:41:42] um
[1:41:52] our heavenly father here we come
[1:41:56] this morning
[1:41:58] to serve the almighty god
[1:42:02] we know before the foundation of the
[1:42:05] world
[1:42:06] we were in your mind
[1:42:10] as even the prophet has
[1:42:12] said we were in your mind
[1:42:16] and then you decided
[1:42:20] to
[1:42:22] make a man in
[1:42:23] of the dust
[1:42:25] of the earth because man was a spirit
[1:42:30] when you are a spirit god man was a
[1:42:32] spirit
[1:42:34] father this morning we just want to
[1:42:37] thank you
[1:42:39] for being your children
[1:42:42] born into season
[1:42:45] of the blood of the lord
[1:42:48] we know your blood is not human blood
[1:42:52] that's why your blood has the power
[1:42:55] over satan
[1:42:58] and his kingdom
[1:43:00] we know lord god even
[1:43:03] satan and his agents
[1:43:06] in these last days

[1:43:24] this is the third pool
[1:43:29] this is the seventh seal
[1:43:32] the power of god
[1:43:35] over all the forces of satan
[1:43:39] we know father they can't receive the
[1:43:41] word of god
[1:43:43] because
[1:43:46] you rejected them from the
[1:43:49] beginning
[1:43:51] the prophet says so
[1:43:53] but we are here just for
[1:43:56] to worship god
[1:44:00] and those who have come for something
[1:44:03] else will get ahead
[1:44:06] because we are here to worship god
[1:44:10] and you devil worship us
[1:44:13] we are here to worship god
[1:44:20] we know what happened even before
