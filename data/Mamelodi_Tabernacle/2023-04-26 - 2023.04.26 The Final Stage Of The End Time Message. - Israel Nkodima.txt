========================================
Jesus Christ [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] thank you all right we are we want to thank God for this morning again and how we started yesterday with a terrible climate um and yet God wanted it to be that way although amen amen you know every child should be tested and so we yesterday we wanted it I mean we came here and then we could witness and see that the children of God here are a real qualities you reminded me of the places that we went to like in Mozambique City and sisters here are witnesses and in composite we went to a place where there's no Road and no Cafe no Bank no nothing amen amen but yet God is God's people who are they called amen and they do not have the taxi Texas mini buses like us is amen amen now um they have a bigger volume for to contain God let us water burning down amen amen when we preach there they always I I heard them shouting sure Pastor sure some without shoes uh but do I tell you that's where God turns better they don't have much of this world to contend with a banana okay we started by saying the final stage of the end time message is then we picked up later a text do you still remember what was it okay and we promised that we look at the that's it through mystery um it is still the same it's a massage it's still the final stage of the [Music] um but this morning we we just went for a few minutes to come from that stage to to where the bride is because the bride today is not a singular woman no namsa no she's married amen now a married woman has some rights Hallelujah and the Bible says if there's something she doesn't understand she will ask the husband amen but the husband also will always consider his wife everything that she know he knows of um so that the wife don't won't depend on any other man amen amen all right amen the bride has to depend on her husband um when God as he was doing his rounds he met Abraham about and coming down to Sodom he first met Abraham and said shall I hide from Abraham the thing that I do yes so God who didn't do anything without first discussing it with Abraham [Applause] the husband will never do anything without first making known to his wife okay so that the wife don't go won't go around asking some other men amen amen that's why we should take it from the husband now we'll start from here leading to that and now let's tend to uh I will start from John Chapter 14 verse 20 to 21. amen amen all right maybe before we read the word of God we going to ask for a prayer foreign Heavenly Father we are so glad to be in this place this piece of ground clear father dwells the people who were there before the foundation of the world Hallelujah and you let us you have led us this far amen just to come to a uh share with our brothers and sisters together the things that they we had shared together amen before there was the prophet says before there was even any Angel yes we were there in him yeah and father we are here to remind ourselves and share together the things that they were there before and there was any Angel yes and that's why today Father The Authority is given to men yes not even the angels cannot know about the secrets that are known made known to me yes Peter in the Bible says even the angels desire to see the things that we see today amen and father we are so blessed with that even in this humble place yes no father as we are here in this very humble Place amen which looks so primitive yes yet the almighty God and knows this place yes and has put his people here Amen to shine as the stars of Heaven Hallelujah and we hear further as they open their mouths yes that there's something deep in their hearts rooted and father we believe we are in the right place at the right time to appreciate to the seed yes as I pray in Jesus Christ's name amen uh just read the scripture for us at that day you shall know that I am in my father and you in me and I in you he that had my commandment and keep at them yes he it is that love to me and he that loved me shall be loved of my father and I will love him and will manifest myself to him amen 20. this is amen amen you may be seated God bless you know so are we happy this morning amen amen you know I will read some things here starting with uh the individuals and so Funda is into our point we we want to uh locate the god of Elijah yes because we know very well that he was coming to his body yeah and we want to see him in the body SMS we also we want to see him in the individual hey each and every one of us must have him in his heart his way amen and this is what makes the bride of Christ is the individuals God has brought together sharing the same ex Supernatural experience amen amen so we are looking at those things we want to worship the god of brothers [Applause] and not only read the spoken word but to worship the god of Brothers speaks of Elisha that Elisha was he typed the pride of Christ and he ended up with the spirit of Elijah in him and when he was coming back with the spirit of Elijah from over Jordan he cried out and said where is the god of Elijah foreign to show that we have believed and when he was coming back the sons of God who stood afarof then when they looked they saw him coming yeah coming back with their power and the world today is been waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God not waiting for them to come with a history I or confusion not to come with the power amen amen because they were with Elijah then when the sons of God looked from afarof they saw that the spirit of Elijah was in Elijah because even the Disciples of the Lord Jesus Christ when they saw them doing the things that they were doing they said but it is because they were with Jesus [Applause] so you need to reflect if you were with Elijah you will reflect Elijah [Applause] if you were with Jesus Christ you will reflect Jesus the church today the bride should be a reflection so that the people can say uh they were with Elijah amen amen all right so this is what we need to see this is Born the manifestation of the sons of God okay now we'll start here the prophet speaks of the you know in you there's some Realms or Dimensions now he says a real believer and when the Holy Spirit that the real believer is Anointed with is this is Christ refuting in his own word the old scripture page seven amen they're all Scripts foreign to that place amen amen and the Shekinah Glory raised from that Mercy Seat one day you know we have a uh where is where are they okay uh summer highlight okay now a the Shekinah Glory race from that messy seat one day and it settled on another Tabernacle foreign and the prophet says the father judges no man but he's committed all judgment to the son that's the Bible says so um God's judgment City and the Lord Jesus says you speak against me it will be forgiven you and um okay Amen Let Me Now another one another okay okay you can speak against the son of man and and I will forgive you the holy spirit will come to dwell in the hearts of the people one wait against it will never be forgiven um if it is now in the body in the hearts of the people the Holy Ghost speaking now from the third it shall never be forgiven our souls amen go right amen then because he says the first room was in heaven the second Throne was in Christ the third Throne is in a man what is a man he is a Triune being Body Soul and Spirit amen amen okay we'll follow that uh all right now we are coming down to that said yeah that will make the bride of Christ who is this bright the bride of Christ is coming from the seven Church ages brother Branham says God has been selecting some people from the churchages and every Church age produced twins yeah says the prophet the canal and the spiritual every church now it always ends up with the Overcomers now he says now God has been selecting overcome us from the every Church age ever makes the bride of Christ so the bread of Christ is made of Overcomers it's a church age produced twins yeah [Applause] all right now and then after the seven Church ages time is then we see the bride of Christ and the others they also constitute and make a church Jesus was kicked out of the church because if you deny him to be who he is you are kicking him out to say the seventh seal is not revealed you are kicking him out [Applause] you'll see it here in the waiting because he is the sins that were revealed [Applause] is he six six seals he is now there is a there is what we call the word of God and there is the revealed word of God [Music] there is something in this book the unveiling of God we can read that we should know between the weight and the revealed words it says to us I will study so now we are invited into him um to be partakers of all that he is maybe you didn't hear it to be partakers Hallelujah can somebody accept it amen because he says that day he shall know that I am in the father you and me and I in you amen now you've got to take note of the third the third is now let this one sink they said you start is I um [Applause] it should end it ends up there in US amen okay now those who followed who who followed Elijah for some kilometers and he was off their screen because he went to Jordan now there was this man Elijah who went there and cross Jordan with Elijah and when he crossed to the seals they crossed with him yeah but others remain in Louisiana so there's others who remain on this side of Jordan amen amen and those who remain on this side the message um the message on this side on the other open who was in the second pool not the third I understand so their message was the second full message um in the wilderness and they disputed Caleb and Joshua but USANA because they believed [Applause] listen to this brother Brennan says now the book of Ephesians I I was just saying is one of the greatest books of the New Testament it leads us onward yeah foreign [Applause] the greatest books of them all Ephesians draws together and positionally places the church Ephesians pleases the church because brother prelim says those men from the majors [Music] I'll quote to you what he says he says they were in a certain place in a certain position now they could see that stuff from a certain position they were placed in a certain position from that position they could see that stuff amen I've got it in the oh here here it is and here it is here now when they were coming the book of Ephesians places you in a certain position uh they were on cameras they were they were on camels they went two years down across the Tigress river and through the swims jungles going to the city has filled with joy they knew when those stars were hanging in there even the astronomers the astronomers say today if if they actually those stars come into one place again it would make one star and [Music] those those stars were actually angels in the form of a star yeah if those stars come into one place again it would make one star from when they are they are standing yeah that's why when I read in the Bible and it tells me of the Angel of the Lord an angel to testify to the seven Church ages now to us from where we are standing it brings one engine [Applause] the angel of the seven Church ages because he's the one who has shown us the seven churches [Applause] because you are standing between Time and Eternity now the prophet says but they had to be standing from that place to see it the woman amen some couldn't see it because of the position from a certain position you can't see it you need to be in a certain position you need to choose the right place to worship where you can see these things it can be seen from any other group I was gonna you've got to be in the right place for a focus [Applause] so it says they had to be standing from that place to see it then he continues the prophets it depends on where you are standing if you come and tell me that it is not revealed I asked you know I know it is because of the position you are the is that my position is very important you must you must be in the right position to see um that's why you know the Bible says I'll read it something quickly here here verse 9. and they came they came unto me one of the Seven Angels who had the seven bowls full of the seven last plagues and talked with me saying come here I will show Thee the bride the Lamb's wife now did you hear me come on yeah I I want meaning I want to show you something but you need to come here [Applause] in order to see it okay I will show Thee the bride is everybody says we are the bread of Christ we are the bread of Christ but you should be in a position [Applause] where you can really see the bride that's why this morning we want to see the bride which one is the bride because everybody is a bride welcome to makoti amen we don't have pieces of the bride of Christ is the blood of Christ is the people selected the Overcomers selected out of every Church age these are the people the prophet says are going to find the battle of Armageddon [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Army oh um the people who stood for the Lord amen come you need to come here that is one of the seven angels and he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain easy the end of the seven Church ages is the top of the mountain man once you are when you are on top of the mountain you are in the middle spot who said that when impact you you can see down [Applause] you are on top of the mountain that's why God took Moses to the top to speak with him and the time Moses was coming back he covered his face because he has seen God from the top from Beyond the church ages on top of the mountains so so he summoned him to come there so watch him against the apple and he carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain and showed me that great City the holy Jerusalem yes um now we are starting with a position as Tata is from today I I should know the right the right place if I want to see these things [Applause] chapter 4 of the same book Revelation uh it's chapter four after this this one after this I looked and behold the door was opened in heaven [Music] thank God for ascending a prophet um we should salute God [Applause] after this after the seven churches I looked and behold a door was open in heaven because when you are on top of of the highest mountains then there's nothing as you look up according to a evening it's now the door amen you are in the middle the right spot to see down and up in town and the first voice that I heard was as it were over trumpet talking with me it is you know again come up here amen amen yeah you want to see something come up yeah you will have a better viewing of things and I will show these things which must be here after um only after you have um [Applause] where you don't leave the church the service with questions listen my man going to church you are always there's something in you babbling amen as you think of going to the service meeting with the Brethren there's something already bubbling in you when when you think how is gonna be amen say you start singing while preparing yourself on a Sunday morning come and go with me to my father's house you see you start singing amen but if you go to church [Applause] you know that brother doesn't know what he's talking about you are not going to worship I hope you are starting from a weak point [Applause] you are fainting already before you get to church because you don't expect to hear anything from God but a true worshiper is somebody who goes to the right place where where he knows that in the house of the Lord he will hear from God that's a true worshiper he goes to service with a song he's coming back with a song and he can go around sharing with the people the word of God amen amen amen amen then he can testify around uh even tomorrow he'll tell the people come and go with me to the house of the Lord because in the house of the Lord that's where we hear the oracles the voice of God and we come there not empty-handed from the Revival people coming from the Revival back from the Revival sitting on the sofas a hey yes amen that's not worshiping God can I pass this area [Applause] in the place of worship the Lord Jesus says the two worshipers shall worship he didn't even say God he says the father foreign because everybody claims to be worshiping God but the father means the jail the Jesus shall worship their father in truth and in spirit [Applause] because you go everywhere you can start now it's Sunday morning everywhere you go Jesus Jesus you 've got this but what are you doing that is that means there's false worshipers no the true worshipers shall worship their father in spirit and the truth for the father one such to worship Him he won't accept any kind of worship it depends on where you are made [Applause] I thought you would be my man I'm a man a man and it depends on where you are standing [Music] it depends on what you are looking at so they have seen it these three measures they followed it and they were right in line [Music] it was right in line with them it land it led to them you know so that's it will always take you here to the right place where the Messiah was born but when they reach Jerusalem they went into the temple in the temple they opened the Scrolls the ministers [Music] still talking about the birth of the Messiah [Music] these ones the majors their Ministry was positive where is amen amen now that was beyond the reading of a scripture is bad because now it's where is he who is King of the Jews now when they asked the question in the temple the ministers unfolded the scroll Isaiah says Behold a son is born unto us so they spoke read about Bethlehem that the governor shall come out of thee amen amen and the three measures they continue to say but where is it because that scripture is being fulfilled but to them they are still in their reading dispensation amen brother Brennan says [Music] after 10 years brother Branham says no manifestations we as the members of The Pride foreign [Applause] [Applause] [Music] because it is in them [Applause] somebody comes tell me brother is the seven seal revealed or not [Applause] hey I don't know brother says says God said nothing says but there's another brother from Cape Town he says you know is they saying he says is not in you man so if it is nothing new if they say he says it amen amen and that pastor says now what do you say Amen amen amen what do you say what is the answer so if you tell me that your brother says you mean that I don't have the answer and that one says amen but the Lord Jesus says on that day you shall know [Applause] you shall know [Applause] to no means say to you and that one says and that one says oh what I know amen and that's why he says the bride when the bride shall know the Rapture shall go [Applause] should know amen because if you don't know you are sitting between things the one comes and saying no it's not like this the other one comes and says it's not that one is this one a man you sing today am en another one coming and say Hey you are in a camp View um [Applause] it's not God saying that [Applause] but somebody comes come on amen [Applause] [Laughter] then you won't sing that song again camping a copy is it speaks of the people camping now when these people were in the king so yeah the Bible says Moses Moses took the congregation one of the people amen amen and has put it affairs [Applause] the people a man who looked for God they went out of the campus Tabernacle of the congregation amen I think you didn't hear this one read it brother you know do you know where it is a book do you know where it is do you know what it is no or read it not that I'm a Funda read it and Moses took the Tabernacle and pitched it without the camp are far off from the camp and call it the Tabernacle of the congregation and it came to pass that everyone which sought the Lord went out onto the Tabernacle of the congregation amen which was without the campuses [Music] [Applause] foreign is the people that are repeating one thing and are not moving on [Applause] you'll find them today in the campus they said pool is not revealed their third pool is not revealed you come back the next year into the same camera it is not revealed but Moses what a Moses he separated he separated the the Tabernacle put it and called it why Visa then is [Applause] we were in laudishian church age we were in the LA auditions camping together but when the seals were revealed we left the campus to the Tabernacle of the congregation [Applause] amen now in the campus not revealed we went out it says for the people who seek the Lord they went to that Tabernacle of the congregation that's why the prophet says amen come out amen amen amen go to the table to the Tabernacle of the congregation amen he separated the people and called it the Tabernacle of the congregation and those who remain in the campus they disputed those in the Tabernacle of the congregation you are in the camp you are in the campus amen the people in the campus calling those who have moved on it's a campus like Baptist it's a camp but amen all right amen now I can say today and I'm sorry they are in the camp okay let's read now after the seven churches Behold a door was open in heaven and the first voice that I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me which said come up foreign [Applause] a man hereafter so the things that happened after brother Brennan said something is the distance and those things happened so you need to come okay amen now finally let's look at this um I'm looking at you know the seventh seal if you don't understand if we were to even some some someday we we talked about it and uh the people those amen and the one brother from Congo said to me no let me just say a brother um I found myself sleeping I said I said brother it was Mount Transfiguration [Applause] they look at Jim with one eye like this and [Applause] Sunny Lane so that was more Transfiguration foreign they were supposed to pray one day I was listening to a brother we were in Mozambique Mr we slept in a place they were in another room I know why brother my cities love you yeah so there's this night prayer you know sometimes it is just forced upon the people we must pray before you you go to bed you must fast for 40 days 40 days we are not Jesus this Brothers I'm listening the brother was trying to pray he never reached the amen amen is because it's not a prayer it is under a law prayer is something it's a spirit oh man a brother I received a message from uh Church of Christ so he says they went through the mountains everyone will one will kneel here another one there another one I said what were you praying for he says for for the power they wanted you know the fullness of God sorry he says no I I know the mountain they went to the island while we each and everyone is praying in his corner now it happened that one brother where he knelt to pray there was a bed a nesting on in that tree these others also hearing the noise of somebody running away foreign [Applause] now I know every Tuesday Assemblies of God I used to be a member there for some time they called for a fast on every Tuesday they called for that me I have never because I didn't know what for now there were two brothers I worked with and they were the youth leaders now during the day on Tuesday because I was open to them that they know I can't fast I don't know what for um they will be the very same people who stood in the church to say yes tomorrow is Tuesday everybody should fast enough that's the youth leaders lunch time Here Comes This brother they went to okay there was an okay Bazaar at least [Applause] so I said to them you announce last night that today no I can't stay without food you're all right but every Tuesday night then they come whose testimonies that day because of fasting during the day you know I felt the spirit of God and I said you are liars before we close Brothers amen [Applause] false things and false tongues they came through this man-made things these things he tells me that at the church where they used to worship they would all speak in tongues amen then he says now you couldn't yeah so he started going up to the mountain for to for those things now he said how did you do it brother hope he says I'll kneel down and try to speak in tongues because I invited them I wanted them so dear disabled amen amen do the way they do it so then I would go home very disappointed because I knew it was me speaking in tongues [Applause] and until I flopped and left the church because I couldn't do the way they do it I said the problem brother is that brother Brenham says because he was now with us okay it was not a random it was languages [Applause] originally each and everyone could hear his own language foreign Paul came and said you are like children you when you found cabosha then he said okay you must have an interpreter because when the people say we are out of out of mind foreign [Applause] each and everyone could hear in his own language [Applause] that's why today the message is in all languages amen you can speak the message speaking in tongues all right can I go for a few minutes amen all right now let me look at this one now my stronger and we are going to look at this party and for a few minutes get the righty into the roots the bride maybe for five minutes six minutes amen amen amen now here is the thing here the angel of the Lord God coming to the bride through the Angels seven churches coming to the body amen seven changes and is the people selected out of seven churches am en it is what do you call when a mama does this no no yeah pattern the pieces that would oh they cut off what do you call them it's a pattern but the SSC is some pieces cut off or whatever you call them I'm talking about of course amen yeah you can say Remnant it's offcuts it's Remnant amen amen he's shaping out a wedding dress or anything nobody but there will be some pieces they are of cuts and with this of course with this of cards you can still do something we are quasu putting them together now he says after God has shaped out the bride what remains is of cats that's why you find because it's different materials you find some are brand name worshipers some say the name brand name is the new name of God the seals are not revealed it's off cards [Music] so you can God can put that on he can't rest himself up with of cards but still they can make something for somebody he will only use the design the one they did shaved out for him but there will be some that will there will be who will come in the second Resurrection I wish we could speak about that um there's the ones that are in the first resurrection and the others others in the second Resurrection those in the first one
