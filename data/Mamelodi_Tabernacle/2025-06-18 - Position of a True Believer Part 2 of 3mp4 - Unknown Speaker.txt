TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] [Music] [Music] Amen. And you know if you have a son and you are a father and your son resembles you. Amen. And when he walks there you look at him because the people say hey you know he's just like his father. Amen. You you'll keep your eye on that boy. Am I like this? Amen. Amen. So now if he's doing fine, he's doing it will please you to know that he is my image. Amen. Now you can say if you see me you see you see him you see me. Amen. And if you can have something that resembles you [Music] in all quarters. Amen. Won't it make you happy? That's right. So God wanted something that could look like him. So he said let us make men in our image. Now the Bible tells me now this man and uh as you know Adam he had all the the the features of God. I can I can tell you something. Maybe you'll believe it. Adam was a young man. Amen. Amen. And after the fall, God himself, no one could replace Adam. He was a product from God. He was not born. Amen. So, and after the fall, uh God looked looked for his image. You know how he cried out, "Adam, where are you?" Because the image shifted after they sin, they started to run. It's still happening even today. People are running away from God because they are not right in their life. anger. Amen. They are still running away. Then God started again. Now when the Lord Jesus came, he I will say again, he died a young man because the Bible says he's the second Adam. Now, if Adam was a young man, that's why we couldn't have an old Jesus. Amen. Or maybe somebody's listening. Adam was a young man. The second Adam was a young man. Only after they had sinned, then they started to age in the second covenant. So now the Lord Jesus Christ was cut off when he was 30 years. A young man. Amen. Amen. He couldn't age because it would not detail with the system in the first covenant. So he was supposed to be cut off a young man, the second Adam. Amen. Amen. So now Adam left his position. and God could not again fellowship Adam cut off the lifeline. Amen. You know today we have a a natural system introduced. We have cell phones. With cell phone, it matters not where you are. As long as you are within the range of the um uh system, they say you are connected. I mean there you you walk around, you'll see what do you call them? transmitters upon the mountains upon the mountains. That's that's the prophets. Amen. You know, God had put some prophets and Moses always used to go up to the mountain as a transmitter. The people wanted to uh speak to God. Moses was the transmitter there so that uh the people could be able to connect. Even today we have a transmitter, the seventh angel messenger. Amen. Our transmitter. Amen. And so God does things like that, natural things, type spiritual things. Moses, he stood up there like a transmitter in that position and there sometimes when the people cut off the line. Amen. Amen. And like maybe I can say again almost all of you all have some cell phones but you have you have air time. Amen. every time because as a pastor you know people phone me tell me but almost every time somebody phones hello hello pastor can you you speak quick quickly amen he only puts three rand time now he wants you to speak quickly You see, so now I mean sales phone was not meant for this. So almost all all of you here you in position of uh cell phones but not air time. If we can cast some votes here only few with air time. Amen. Now you you find many people in the churches this morning but without spirit time. Amen. They won't connect. They always tell God, "Please call me." Amen. Right now, let's turn to this. Amen. My my my h my uh what's the name? Granddaughter. Always she picks up my cell and say, Call me. Many call me. Please call me. Please call me. Please call me. Please call me. Amen. Amen. And I'll always say no. Let's wait until they call me. Amen. This what happened in the garden of Ed. Adam was now running away and he sent God please call me please call me. So Adam he had no no air time. You get what I what I mean now let's look at this position is very very important. H Christianity is a position. You change from something to something and you know if you can offer somebody let's say I learned somebody and you say I I want you to uh manage this place. I've got an office for you computer and all things and the person is not learned you know you'll put a fright in him. Amen. Amen. So now he must qualify for for that position. Then you'll find somebody coming with a diploma looking for a a job. He qualifies. You just put him in an office with the computer and all those things. He straight away he'll start to connect and that is he's qualified for that. Amen. Now he will fit in in that position because he was trained for that position. Amen. Now that's why now in our day where the problem is is that God uh has put forward to us like you read in the papers they tell you jobs jobs. Yeah. They want a driver with five years experience. Yeah, they want a manager. Yeah, they want a personel. All those things. Amen. But there's somebody who can't even read those things. Maybe he can read Job because Job is common, you know. Then after seeing Job, he will try maybe to look at this. He doesn't understand what a person a person you know you find things like that. And now you come to the spiritual things. You'll see these things. I'll read it for you. So there's some uh advertisements but you need to qualify. Amen. Now if I I don't qualify. I have not done a computer. I won't bother myself. If there's line up of computer jobs there, I just look at them and say, "I'll turn to something else because I don't qualify here." Amen. You put to a man, then he Jesus saves. This one speaks of Jesus. you you know things like that because he doesn't qualify you things like that now that's why now position is very important in as I say everything is strong in its position uh I was reading even the other They're talking about the bears and they talking about the Milky Way up there, you know, of stars and stars and stars. And uh now they say these birds for migration they use the Milky Way. That's the position. Their position. You can try to do that. You'll fail. That's their position. God's given position. How they do it? I understand they also have a prophet. When they start to fly to migrate The the prophet goes up with his um uh uh compass. Then he will look this side, look that way, look that way. Then he will start to fly. Amen. And uh the rest the subject. So they some of them from Europe to South Africa certain season they come here but they say they use the universe to to find their location to locate the place. Have you ever seen a lost bed? No. All right. Now we'll read. I I have a dog at home. If you can open your gate by mistake, [Music] it will dash out, gone, the whole day. I know of I had two of them. They vanish sometimes before I experienced this. and I thought they were gone late in the afternoon. Yeah, they are coming tired. Amen. Amen. Now, one man who experienced these things. He said to me, you know what, brother? Uh these things you can as long as you drive your car to and fro to and fro you will leave something for them. What is that? Once you you take your dog, he says you can you can go far with this dog in your car and leave it there. and drive back. That dog will find its way back. How? It can smell. That's right. Like for it to know you and accept you in it will start by it will smell and smell and smell. Next time you come, that's right. It will accept you. It knows you. Okay. It can use eyes, nose, and all those things. Now I can try to do that. I will feel. [Music] But I take it far. It will take that sand. I leave it there. I go home then it will come follow the sand. It's a unique position. Now you find a child of God. You can leave him where the prophet says you can dig six feet down and put his body there. He will still come and pick up that body, very unique. On the day of the resurrection, the spirit is released. The spirit picks the soul and he will pick up that body again. That's why the Bible says the the the graves were open. Only bones in there. There were bones in there. Amen. But those spirits, they picked up the soul. They came back again. And they revived the whole body. Amen. It's unique how God and now if somebody was in heaven with God, you can leave him in a bar or somewhere else. There will be a time when he will start moving back again. he will start to leave those things. Amen. And I said to a brother, he h after he had um together with some of the brethren, he broke away from the church. So I said to him, when we met at the funeral, I said, "Where are those children? you deceived says uh no you know pastor you know I think one one day we'll meet and so I said oh no now let me tell you something you know an eagle said yeah I said you can steal the the the young ones and take you far away take them far away amen now Remember while they are there they are growing. Amen. Amen. The Bible says when when Moses come to age he forsook Egypt. He started to pick up the Jewish scent. Amen. He started to pick up the Hebrew scent and he started to move. Amen. Amen. So he could have been a rich man in Egypt, richest. Amen. He had everything there. A son of Pharaoh's daughter. But when that time arrived, he looked around. Amen. Amen. And he had another sense. And the Bible says he saw the invisible one. He saw the promised land. He saw the children of Israel as the people of the promise. Amen. He saw Egypt as a dying nation. So he started to move around and he started to go. He picked up a Jewish scent. Then he said, "I'm not an Egyptian." Amen. I belong to another race. I'm a child of the promised people. So he started to take off the Egyptian attire seeing the invisible one and he started to move. A Christian is a person on the move. Amen. No time for drugs and all those things. He's a person on the move. Amen. Amen. Isn't he wonderful? So that that that was Moses and it cost him some things cost him some things. That was his position. So I said to this brother, one day these eagles, these eaglers, they will grow and the instinct in them will start to look for the original places. They will start to look for their parents and you will never see them again. They will leave you. And uh after some months, it happened. Amen. The people he drew away, they started to move back. It's just like that. from heaven. The people here on earth after the fall of our parents there. The people here they started to move back again as so generous and pilgrims and so forth. Abraham started there looking for a city. Amen. Amen. And on his pilgrimage he met Mechisedc the king of that city to come the king of Berland. So he met him. Now that's why the prophet says if your ministry don't come to a supernatural point with that ministry. The ministry must bring to a supernatural right now. Let's look at this. Now, the Bible says, "A true worshipper shall worship the father." I want to read this scripture. H this is thing started somewhere in Switzerland. When I looked at this thing, he said, The woman said, "Our fathers worship in this mountain." And you say that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship. Jesus said unto her, "Woman, believe me, the hour cometh, when ye shall neither in this mountain, nor yet at Jerusalem worship the the Father, Now notice this thing. Worship the father. Amen. Amen. Ye worship you not not what we know what we worship for salvation is of the Jews. Amen. But the hour cometh. As long as salvation is of the Jews only can worship God don't hear him because in those days salvation was of the Amen. Amen. Now under in our day all right salvation is for a certain class God is is responsible for that. Amen. Why people can cannot believe the same thing. Jesus came. He made miracles. He made this and that enough to convince a a human being. But some were not converted. They just refused him and called him names. But others worshiped him. Amen. What is this? Salvation was for this and not for this. All right. Amen. So you put all things I if I can throw you into the water, you won't survive there. If I put you into the water and I take a fish out of the water, the fish won't I'll survive. Yeah. you won't survive. The water is for the fish. Amen. Amen. Amen. So that's where it is converted. Amen. Its position is in the water. Now it's not for you. It's for the fish. Amen. Amen. Once you talk about water, the fish would be jumping. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Now salvation was for a special type of people for other. But the Lord said now we are going to introduce salvation to the Samaritans as well to the other nations. But right now it's only for the Jews. So a Samaritan would come and there will be an excuse. Oh, sorry. It's just for the Jews. Amen. And then but the hour cometh and now is when the true worshippers. Now there's worshippers and true worshippers. [Applause] True worshippers shall worship the father. Now that time is now is coming. Now let's go back again because the Jews in those days they worshiped the father. Now he say and the the time is now but the time is coming. All right. Amen. The time that time is now because Peter and Philip and Philip was there at that time before uh he died on rose again. They worshiped the father there. That's what they knew. Now the lord says the time is now and the time is coming. That is our time here. Time is coming. Amen. Now he said you you worship and but the hour cometh and now is two. One is coming, one is now. When the true worshippers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth. For the father seeketh such to worship him. So he puts the pattern. He puts the standard. Those who will worship me. They will worship me in spirit. And that is his own spirit. That means he will give them that spirit. Amen. Amen. For the father seeketh such to worship him. That means if the others worship the father won't even listen because the the true worshippers worship in spirit because God is a spirit. God is a spirit and they that worship must worship him in spirit and in truth. And the woman said, "I know that Messiah cometh." She had started to to to sense and to send something. I know that Messiah cometh who is called the the Christ. When he is come, he will tell us all things. And now I I perceive now. Amen. Amen. Okay. Now the thing is now let's read this and close. Page 22. I'll I'll try this book here page 22 that is um this book here. Uh Christ is revealed in his No, no, no. Mighty God. Uh, I hope I've got the thing here because it is in some pages. Uh, page I want to read page 22.2. Uh, just hold on with me. Hold on for me. I'll read you that thing. Now, while while I'm looking for this, if you not, I will just quote to you. The prophet says here, Oh, yeah. Yeah. The Bible says, "Seek and you shall find." Page 22, I'll read you this part. Now, uh he said uh uh uh you know uh that book Luke uh 17:30. So shall it be when the son of man now not the son of God. The son of God is some is is another position and the son of God is another position of the same person. Amen. Now let's see now. Now the position of a true worshipper. He he or she's in a position to identify Amen. You know if you don't know a computer and you look at a person operating a computer there, you are just looking. You don't know what he's doing. Amen. So he knows what he's doing. But you I don't know a thing. just be looking at him. You get what I mean? So, but he he is in that position. Now, let's close with this. Listen to this. The true worshippers shall worship the father. Now, there's a time when they worshiped the father. That's why now if you turn to Peter here, Peter says, the Lord says, who do men say that I, the son of man am? Now listen carefully, who do men say, I the son of man, not the son of God. people. I the son of man. Son of man means prophet. Who do men say I the son of man am? And they said you are that. You are that. You are that. And and he said who do you? Now that was to the prophetic class. Who do you say that I the son of man am? Amen. Now I want you to note he never said son of god son of man. He meant who do you say I the prophet that was son of man. The prophets were called son of man. son of man. And Peter said, thou art the Christ, son of the living God. And he said, Peter, flesh and blood has not revealed this, but my father. Now, let's put it right now. Peter says, "The Jews never knew about this. The son of man was the Christ. Now Peter says, "Thou art the Christ, son of the living God." And he said, "Peter, it's a revelation. [Applause] The father you worship has now given you a revelation [Applause] for the next dispensation. Amen. For a Jew to know that he is the Christ in those days was a revelation. Amen. Amen. So that's why he says Peter this is a very important thing the father has revealed this to you that I the prophet am the Christ you see the difference now amen and as he said to that woman the time will come that they will worship the father and now now is Now the Jews do worship like this, but there will be another time. And he was referring to the end time when the son of man will be revealed again. Amen. Now I'm reading here because he must be reveal. It's not by reading. It's not by reading, it's by revelation. So he was revealed to them. Then he said to them, "Tell no man that I, the son of man, am the Christ." Because it was a new thing to the Jews that this man is the Christ. That's why uh the Samaritan woman he said come and see come and see a man because he was a man. Come and see a man. Listen what he says now. How she picked up this they don't know. Amen. Amen. Come and see. Firstly, come and see a man. Come and see a man who told me all things that ever I did. Is not this the Christ. They were looking. She was looking for a man, a man that is the Christ. What made things different was that this one was the Christ. [Music] [Music] [Music]
