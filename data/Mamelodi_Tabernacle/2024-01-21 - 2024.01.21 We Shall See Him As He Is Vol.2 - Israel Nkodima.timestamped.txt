[1:07:22] time he told them about the the time of
[1:07:29] lot the time of lot it was
[1:07:34] fire amen right amen when these things

[1:08:11] will be able to tell you
[1:08:14] about this
[1:08:18] California as the prophet has narrated
[1:08:21] to
[1:08:22] us
[1:08:24] but it was fire all
[1:08:27] over that is
[1:08:30] lot after that then
[1:08:36] started that is
[1:08:39] Noah right amen now we are
[1:08:44] always uh on the brink yes we are at the
[1:08:49] end of Noah's
[1:08:52] time

[1:08:56] all all of these
[1:09:00] things Abraham was not
[1:09:06] involved fire couldn't
[1:09:09] touch the anointed of
[1:09:12] God and even today Satan will do
[1:09:18] nothing Amen to the anointed of
[1:09:22] God
[1:09:26] because uh they are going in
[1:09:33] the even if he knows that they are going
[1:09:35] in the
[1:09:38] rupture but he has no power to stop
[1:09:46] that all right amen
[1:09:49] let's we have
[1:09:51] ready so I'm going to go back to this a
[1:09:56] bit and we
[1:09:59] will go back we we are just in that
[1:10:02] region of the
[1:10:09] supernatural

[1:10:15] church they are a
[1:10:21] people I call them the T

[1:10:33] seen the
[1:10:35] time that we are we are living
[1:10:41] in and of
[1:10:43] course if you don't pass to the other
[1:10:49] side you remain in
[1:10:52] darkness you don't even see that the
[1:10:55] Lord is
[1:10:56] coming you keep on doing your own
[1:11:02] things that's why it say the day shall
[1:11:06] come as a thief in the
[1:11:10] night a thief don't make
[1:11:15] appointments amen amen but to
[1:11:20] his we have an appointment Jes
[1:11:26] and we
[1:11:28] that we have an appointment with
[1:11:33] him amen amen as he had appointment with
[1:11:39] Abraham and at the appointed
[1:11:43] time he said shall I hide from
[1:11:47] Abraham this thing that I do that was
[1:11:52] before those angels went
[1:11:57] to amen
[1:12:00] am when the Angels before they started
[1:12:04] off he said shall I hide from
[1:12:11] Abraham shall he
[1:12:15] hide amen amen now the bride of
[1:12:19] Christ uh to say his wife
[1:12:26] she won't hide
[1:12:29] anything to his
[1:12:34] wife so we we we have read the
[1:12:39] scripture uh it
[1:12:42] says when he
[1:12:46] opened
[1:12:52] the now
[1:12:55] seven that's that
[1:12:58] [Music]
[1:13:01] number on the seventh
[1:13:04] day what did God
[1:13:10] do amen am so he did
[1:13:14] nothing on
[1:13:19] the so
[1:13:21] seven is a special
[1:13:26] number in the
[1:13:30] Bible okay that's why we have seven
[1:13:33] Church
[1:13:37] ages but we
[1:13:41] are on the
[1:13:46] tip the last Church
[1:13:49] [Music]
[1:13:52] age before the
[1:13:54] ruption amen amen
[1:13:58] amen but we are going to read for few
[1:14:03] minutes and
[1:14:06] uh now in this
[1:14:10] age he has opened our spiritual eyes so
[1:14:17] wide you even can be able to see those
[1:14:21] that that are
[1:14:29] and those that are not
[1:14:32] going still clinging to the things of
[1:14:35] the
[1:14:37] world because they don't see
[1:14:41] him all right
[1:14:45] amen uh that sister
[1:14:48] yesterday Brothers have had she
[1:14:52] said
[1:14:54] the she was talking of the
[1:14:58] rupture but saying only
[1:15:04] few you know when we were there the
[1:15:10] conference that brother
[1:15:15] also we said somewhere with my brother
[1:15:22] here in the message
[1:15:25] that
[1:15:27] we it's time time is
[1:15:32] over but he was also
[1:15:36] saying
[1:15:39] uh this brother of
[1:15:42] mine uh referring to one of us
[1:15:47] here saying he has some
[1:15:52] people and uh he's going together with
[1:15:56] those he he call them hey
[1:16:01] people so I was not
[1:16:05] surprised when this sister also
[1:16:08] said you are going with only a
[1:16:14] few and the brother also said
[1:16:18] that
[1:16:20] and the prophet confirmed
[1:16:25] that only
[1:16:30] few uh the church churches are
[1:16:36] full the
[1:16:39] people but undecided
[1:16:44] people they don't know where they are
[1:16:49] going now a
[1:16:51] person who is on a
[1:16:54] journey who is about to start
[1:16:59] off it's not
[1:17:01] by he's not like in the mood of somebody
[1:17:05] who is just
[1:17:08] relaxing and he's going
[1:17:12] nowhere amen
[1:17:14] amen can you identify this
[1:17:19] things there are
[1:17:21] people that are
[1:17:25] amen amen and checking of the things of
[1:17:29] the
[1:17:30] world knowing that they are
[1:17:34] going but they are
[1:17:37] those uh they will carry
[1:17:40] on with their own
[1:17:42] things all right
[1:17:45] amen
[1:17:47] while one wants to
[1:17:50] see himself or herself
[1:17:54] the other one wants to see
[1:17:58] Jesus because that's where he came
[1:18:03] from you know if you are from
[1:18:07] him the desire you
[1:18:10] have is to be like
[1:18:16] him amen amen what do you call
[1:18:20] [Music]
[1:18:21] that yeah you know identity when you
[1:18:25] some people want to to be like
[1:18:33] him I want to thank some sisters
[1:18:43] brothers those who realize
[1:18:46] that the time has
[1:18:50] arrived
[1:18:51] now because he keeps on
[1:18:57] changing the Lord changing
[1:19:01] us amen amen that's why he said when he
[1:19:05] shall
[1:19:07] appear we shall be like
[1:19:12] him amen amen it never said I shall be
[1:19:16] like
[1:19:21] myself
[1:19:23] amen if there's a good camera then God
[1:19:27] has
[1:19:32] one we were made in his
[1:19:37] shape the
[1:19:40] supernatural all right now let let us
[1:19:42] look at
[1:19:43] this and uh
[1:19:48] because
[1:19:50] um I reach some something
[1:19:55] here sometimes we look at the day of
[1:20:03] redemption sometimes
[1:20:05] back and if you can
[1:20:08] remember uh
[1:20:11] we I read from a
[1:20:13] [Music]
[1:20:14] place that says the day of
[1:20:19] redemption is the day the book is open
[1:20:26] that is the day
[1:20:29] of so meaning that
[1:20:34] like Paul
[1:20:38] says these
[1:20:40] things we preach to the
[1:20:47] perfect now in that book message book of
[1:20:54] Hebrews B I find this place where it
[1:20:59] says what is
[1:21:02] perfection what is to be
[1:21:05] perfect he says that's when you have
[1:21:08] eternal
[1:21:11] life nothing can be
[1:21:16] perfect
[1:21:19] unless
[1:21:21] eternal if it is not
[1:21:25] Eternal it is not
[1:21:27] perfect
[1:21:30] amen that's why you see the people that
[1:21:35] are not
[1:21:37] Eternal they can be
[1:21:43] perfect okay
[1:21:46] amen because you know you still remember
[1:21:51] that let us look at
[1:21:56] this all right we are
[1:21:59] all coming
[1:22:02] together Sundays
[1:22:07] conferences singing
[1:22:11] together amen but are we going
[1:22:18] together
[1:22:20] now because Paul says
[1:22:24] that's why we are going to have you seen
[1:22:27] that we have passed the
[1:22:31] [Music]
[1:22:33] church
[1:22:36] amen that means after passing the
[1:22:41] church it's a walk with
[1:22:48] God as it
[1:22:50] says you know
[1:22:53] walked with
[1:22:55] [Applause]
[1:22:57] God is there somebody who can understand
[1:23:02] that to
[1:23:04] walk with
[1:23:07] [Music]
[1:23:09] God meaning
[1:23:11] that your mind you are so mindful of
[1:23:19] God amen amen
[1:23:23] with
[1:23:25] God the Bible says how he pleased
[1:23:30] God he with God God was so pleased that
[1:23:35] he took
[1:23:39] it amen
[1:23:42] amen even
[1:23:45] now he's coming for
[1:23:50] those we like en
[1:23:53] the seventh man
[1:23:58] from and this is the seventh Church
[1:24:03] [Music]
[1:24:05] age from
[1:24:08] Paul the first church
[1:24:13] age now you see the
[1:24:17] Paul he went to
[1:24:19] the thir third heaven
[1:24:26] what a
[1:24:29] testimony amen then you count from
[1:24:32] Paul you come to
[1:24:35] S Elijah the
[1:24:38] prophet he was also taken to the six
[1:24:42] Dimension because as the
[1:24:45] forerunners must go
[1:24:48] before and come
[1:24:51] back
[1:24:53] you see amen so that's it amen
[1:24:58] but you can
[1:25:00] see that
[1:25:04] Enoch the
[1:25:07] seven the Bible very much interested in
[1:25:10] saying he is the
[1:25:17] seventh just like this
[1:25:20] seven Church age
[1:25:24] there's no other Church
[1:25:26] age that is
[1:25:28] coming is
[1:25:32] finished okay let us read this part
[1:25:36] here and
[1:25:38] uh we
[1:25:40] will is there some brethren to be
[1:25:47] baptized may the Lord bless
[1:25:50] them I was talking about the
[1:25:54] brothers even
[1:25:57] yesterday that but not to call any
[1:26:02] name this mama said to
[1:26:05] me some years
[1:26:07] back he said H there is some
[1:26:13] people they told her
[1:26:16] that we are waiting
[1:26:20] here for the pastor to come
[1:26:23] and take
[1:26:28] fures and then now she told me
[1:26:32] that and one
[1:26:35] day can I say
[1:26:37] it one
[1:26:39] day we were
[1:26:42] baptizing there was a baptism
[1:26:46] service then here appear some
[1:26:51] m
[1:26:52] I uh they they just they were in a in
[1:26:57] line like
[1:26:59] this almost the same
[1:27:04] age
[1:27:06] and when I look at them I couldn't make
[1:27:09] any
[1:27:11] difference to me they appeared to be in
[1:27:15] the
[1:27:20] same and uh I asked if brother can
[1:27:27] recall I asked him who are this
[1:27:32] m and he said I don't
[1:27:36] know then I was just
[1:27:40] thinking not knowing why I was
[1:27:47] concerned it's because they look to me
[1:27:51] somehow
[1:27:56] and what
[1:27:58] right is
[1:28:02] then I
[1:28:04] remember that that
[1:28:07] mama told me that there's some
[1:28:12] women they said we are waiting for the
[1:28:17] pastor to come
[1:28:21] in
[1:28:25] then I thought this should be those
[1:28:32] M then after
[1:28:35] that there was
[1:28:37] another
[1:28:41] service
[1:28:43] also in the two I do you still remember
[1:28:49] brother no that was a a group of
[1:28:53] boys young
[1:28:57] men also I question who are these
[1:29:04] people now people come and be
[1:29:07] baptized many times but I was concerned
[1:29:13] with and asking a question who are
[1:29:17] they then I think the brother will
[1:29:21] remind me if
[1:29:25] if I did ask him the same
[1:29:29] question where is this children
[1:29:34] from all right am okay
[1:29:39] now that's just that
[1:29:43] mm when he shall
[1:29:45] appear we shall be say we shall be like
[1:29:50] him
[1:29:52] furthermore it says and we shall see
[1:29:56] him as he
[1:29:59] [Music]
[1:30:01] is not not according to the
[1:30:07] description but you see him
[1:30:13] as you know to identify him it's not
[1:30:17] after somebody gives you a
[1:30:20] photo because you are like
[1:30:24] him amen amen so when you see him you'll
[1:30:30] be looking at
[1:30:33] yourself you know God made it so
[1:30:38] special and said let us make men in our
[1:30:47] image amen
[1:30:49] amen so
[1:30:52] for him to identify
[1:30:55] us he made us in
[1:31:00] his amen so when he looks at
[1:31:04] you he sees
[1:31:08] himself all right amen
[1:31:12] Pastor
[1:31:15] okay you know I like what brother Bram
[1:31:19] said one
[1:31:20] time
[1:31:23] have you seen
[1:31:26] that uh
[1:31:32] Rabbi you know there have been some
[1:31:38] uh people saying
[1:31:42] this calling this
[1:31:45] message calling it
[1:31:50] what
[1:31:53] some were even
[1:31:56] saying bram's
[1:32:00] cult then this
[1:32:05] Rabbi I I we have seen
[1:32:09] it he said I even asked a brother to
[1:32:14] make a cutting of
[1:32:16] that he
[1:32:20] said
[1:32:22] he
[1:32:23] said some something about
[1:32:29] brother and he
[1:32:33] said
[1:32:35] who will ever say
[1:32:41] something
[1:32:45] against that
[1:32:48] Prophet God will never forgive you
[1:32:56] all
[1:32:57] right
[1:32:59] because we take the
[1:33:03] scriptures
[1:33:05] now
[1:33:08] reading doesn't put you anywhere closer
[1:33:11] to
[1:33:13] God but
[1:33:19] Revelation that's the one that that I
[1:33:21] did identifies
[1:33:24] you amen
[1:33:28] amen and it gives you a divine
[1:33:33] nature you don't look at
[1:33:36] God like as you look at your
[1:33:42] photo amen you know I can look at my
[1:33:47] photo this
[1:33:50] is amen amen but still I will put it
[1:33:55] aside I want my real
[1:34:03] identity what is your real
[1:34:09] identity if you can
[1:34:12] say
[1:34:14] brother identify yourself I'll bring
[1:34:19] Christ amen
[1:34:21] [Applause]
[1:34:23] I'll tell you about Christ that's my
[1:34:30] identity I don't want to know about
[1:34:33] myself I want to know about
[1:34:37] him and identify
[1:34:40] myself we'll talk about it one
[1:34:43] day you know I have this book Christ is
[1:34:46] the mystery of God
[1:34:50] revealed
[1:34:52] H it tells me of my
[1:34:56] identity and this is the time for each
[1:34:59] and every one of
[1:35:01] us to know who he
[1:35:06] is where are you
[1:35:08] from where are you
[1:35:13] going amen

[1:35:50] time and uh maybe you can go to New

[1:36:37] right will come I was supposed to bring
[1:36:41] something
[1:36:44] here where it speaks of

[1:50:59] which
[1:51:00] Sons Daughters of

[1:51:40] open amen and you come because you have
[1:51:45] heard
[1:51:48] your
[1:51:51] your name was
[1:51:53] written in the book The LS Book of
[1:51:59] Life
[1:52:02] hallu stemed Through the blood of the
[1:52:05] Lord
[1:52:09] Jesus now you are a bline
[1:52:15] child that's
[1:52:18] why the king
[1:52:22] man when he saw you in a fallen
[1:52:26] stage he came knowing that only his
[1:52:33] blood bring you
[1:52:39] back you are
[1:52:45] kman hey
[1:52:47] brother you know if one day can you sit
[1:52:53] down you don't need to drink beer a
[1:52:57] bit be in your
[1:53:02] mind and
[1:53:05] uh read the
[1:53:09] Bible and see
[1:53:12] how God became your
[1:53:18] Kingman
[1:53:22] you are
[1:53:23] saved by the blood of the king's
[1:53:31] man now his death was not just
[1:53:36] death
[1:53:40] no when that's why when
[1:53:46] Mary
[1:53:48] uh the pregnant of
[1:53:52] Mary was was something
[1:53:57] else because she knew no
[1:54:01] man but an angel
[1:54:04] came and put Joseph
[1:54:09] aside because God wanted to plant his
[1:54:13] own
[1:54:18] SE that's why he
[1:54:20] said Mary you are
[1:54:25] blessed why
[1:54:29] blessed you are going to
[1:54:31] receive seed from
[1:54:38] God the bride of Christ
[1:54:41] today is
[1:54:46] blessed because she has received SE
[1:54:50] from God the Seven
[1:54:57] Seals
[1:54:59] and Mary could
[1:55:01] not deny
[1:55:03] [Music]
[1:55:05] it an
[1:55:08] angel
[1:55:10] came with the seed of
[1:55:12] God to
[1:55:14] Mary and said you are
[1:55:18] blessed the
[1:55:25] churches and gave
[1:55:29] her
[1:55:31] now the
[1:55:33] word now not just a
[1:55:37] scripture but the seed
[1:55:43] word we can read the same
[1:55:48] book
[1:55:50] but to the to
[1:55:52] others it's a
[1:55:56] SE to one person is just
[1:56:02] reading M amen but to the other one it
[1:56:06] is
[1:56:09] seed that's why somebody can come here
[1:56:12] and

[2:09:25] this and I said put your
[2:09:28] hand where the
[2:09:30] pain she did that and immediately she
[2:09:34] said it's no longer
[2:09:37] there
[2:09:39] amen amen
[2:09:42] amen because if you are a child of God
[2:09:46] you can
[2:09:47] transfer
[2:09:48] [Applause]
[2:09:54] why we are singing there is power
[2:10:02] power
[2:10:04] Samson knew
[2:10:06] that he had
[2:10:09] power in
[2:10:11] him
[2:10:13] amen and
[2:10:15] uh every time you would leave
[2:10:18] home
[2:10:20] to
[2:10:21] go
[2:10:25] [Music]
[2:10:28] somewhere you you've never seen him with
[2:10:31] Dum
[2:10:39] balls the Bible
[2:10:43] says she had a Nazarite
[2:10:47] vow
[2:10:51] now the power was not in the
[2:10:54] head the secret was not was not in the
[2:10:59] head but the secret was in the
[2:11:05] heart but God
[2:11:07] said unless he
[2:11:11] keeps
[2:11:14] the The
[2:11:17] Naz
[2:11:22] until you you you must keep
[2:11:27] it the
[2:11:32] na amen amen if Satan
[2:11:37] comes he doesn't look at you he looks at
[2:11:41] what's in
[2:11:47] you
[2:11:48] then he can pick it
[2:11:51] up that there's nothing in
[2:11:55] there there's
[2:12:00] doubt
[2:12:04] en Satan knows
[2:12:09] that when it comes to those things he
[2:12:13] becomes a
[2:12:16] commander as long as they existing
[2:12:19] you the devil is
[2:12:25] delighted all right
[2:12:27] amen now even the
[2:12:30] Philistines they didn't know the power
[2:12:33] of
[2:12:37] sson they only saw the
[2:12:41] logs but the power was not in the
[2:12:45] L was in the heart of
[2:12:50] as long as
[2:12:52] Samson kept the
[2:12:54] logs the
[2:13:00] power as long as you keep the
[2:13:07] virtues the power remains
[2:13:11] with as long as you can keep the word of
[2:13:15] God in you is
[2:13:23] with not because you lift
[2:13:26] up
[2:13:29] because of the
[2:13:32] secret that is
[2:13:34] in then the
[2:13:36] power because sin is like a
[2:13:45] rat sin destroys
[2:13:48] [Music]
[2:13:52] like a red in your
[2:13:57] kitchen all right amen you find yourself
[2:14:00] becoming weak
[2:14:08] and and you
[2:14:11] pray
[2:14:13] but if you
[2:14:15] pray God says go and do my
[2:14:20] [Music]
[2:14:25] will if you do the will of the
[2:14:28] Lord then God
[2:14:35] performs he's a great
[2:14:38] performer but only if you can keep his
[2:14:45] way because God in the beginning was the
[2:14:49] word the word was with God and the Word
[2:14:54] was
[2:14:56] God let me close with
[2:15:00] this
[2:15:02] I it goes with
[2:15:05] this the Bible
[2:15:07] says brother that
[2:15:11] scripture grieve
[2:15:15] not Ephesians
[2:15:20] grieve not the Holy
[2:15:24] Spirit what it says Ephesians
[2:15:28] 4:3 and grieve not the holy spirit of
[2:15:31] God whereby ye are sealed and until the
[2:15:35] day of redemption amen just keep keep it
[2:15:41] there you are
[2:15:44] sealed
[2:15:46] unto day
[2:15:51] of the word
[2:15:54] redeem
[2:15:56] meaning to take
[2:15:58] something back to his
[2:16:04] original if it is
[2:16:08] back if you are back in your
[2:16:13] original
[2:16:15] please they say you are redeemed
[2:16:21] why
[2:16:22] because
[2:16:24] Satan couldn't beat
[2:16:31] you or to
[2:16:34] overcome Satan could
[2:16:39] overc
[2:16:41] butson Satan will never overcome
[2:16:46] you but as long long as you keep the
[2:16:50] word of
[2:16:52] God now you can keep the
[2:16:56] L but if you don't keep the
[2:16:59] way
[2:17:01] the can
[2:17:05] shave
[2:17:09] amen it is a naite
[2:17:14] v no razor
[2:17:16] shall
[2:17:20] [Music]
[2:17:22] if you can
[2:17:24] keep the
[2:17:27] way then it will keep Satan at
[2:17:33] Bay all
[2:17:35] right
[2:17:38] now that's that is the thing
[2:17:43] lastly why we are struggling so
[2:17:46] much
[2:17:50] and you read the Bible
[2:17:53] says if you believe him all things are
[2:17:58] possible and the people they say I
[2:18:01] believe but nothing is
[2:18:06] possible does that mean he's a
[2:18:11] liar no there's something
[2:18:16] wrong
[2:18:19] if you
[2:18:22] believe there at the conference confence
[2:18:25] I was with the
[2:18:27] brothers a sister with my
[2:18:31] husband they came to my office
[2:18:34] there I was with the
[2:18:37] brothers and then she
[2:18:41] said I feel something in me like in my
[2:18:45] body running to like
[2:18:51] and
[2:18:52] then
[2:18:55] uh I think we were with
[2:18:59] Pastor
[2:19:01] Edgar Ed now I said put your
[2:19:07] hand where the thing
[2:19:10] is she did that then I touch her
[2:19:16] hand
[2:19:18] right knowing
[2:19:20] that she believes that I'm her her
[2:19:26] pastor when I did
[2:19:30] that she said it's no longer
[2:19:37] there now there are some
[2:19:41] people it is hard for them to believe
[2:19:46] God
[2:19:48] they believe
[2:19:49] that there was a sister
[2:19:52] from I don't know whether the sister
[2:19:56] still exist around
[2:19:59] the she couldn't walk and this and
[2:20:05] that then we prayed for
[2:20:09] her and uh she got
[2:20:12] healed then one day she came to me uh if
[2:20:17] she is
[2:20:20] here uh you don't know you don't know
[2:20:24] her I won't identify her it's just a
[2:20:28] testimony and she
[2:20:31] came uh one day
[2:20:34] said uh I went to see a
[2:20:39] doctor I said yes okay then she
[2:20:44] said
[2:20:46] now
[2:20:48] uh she spoke something about like having
[2:20:53] received the
[2:20:59] medication now I said were you
[2:21:04] sick she said no I just went for a
[2:21:13] checkup are you still trying to confirm
[2:21:16] that God has healed
[2:21:20] but I didn't say
[2:21:24] this
[2:21:25] no in my heart I
[2:21:28] said that that means the sister is not
[2:21:32] sure she's not sure of her
[2:21:37] healing amen
[2:21:39] amen because you know God just said let
[2:21:44] there be
[2:21:46] light
[2:21:50] [Music]
[2:21:53] and and there
[2:21:55] was
[2:21:57] light because even nature obeyed the
[2:22:02] word of
[2:22:07] God because the
[2:22:10] son it's
[2:22:13] natural but nature obeyed God
[2:22:19] now I said
[2:22:21] sister God has healed
[2:22:24] you but it looks
[2:22:28] like you doubt the word of
[2:22:31] God power of
[2:22:33] God you still go and say
[2:22:36] doctor examine
[2:22:39] me amen amen instead of going around
[2:22:46] singing amen
[2:22:49] amen the great
[2:22:52] phys now is
[2:22:54] [Music]
[2:22:55] here
[2:22:59] amen ah now from the sympathizing
[2:23:06] Jesus you went to
[2:23:09] medical doctor after you were
[2:23:14] [Music]
[2:23:15] healed I'm not
[2:23:18] saying you should not see the
[2:23:22] doctor I'm not saying
[2:23:24] that I'm talking about the
[2:23:27] sister got
[2:23:29] healed after the
[2:23:32] healing he went for a
[2:23:36] check I said what
[2:23:39] for because I wanted to make
[2:23:46] sure
[2:23:49] do you want to make sure that God Is A
[2:23:55] Healer sister tell me you want to make
[2:23:59] sure that God Is A
[2:24:04] Healer oh no
[2:24:06] answer all
[2:24:09] right I'm closing with
[2:24:12] this the
[2:24:15] lamb we have read the scripture but we
[2:24:18] haven't touched
[2:24:20] it when he
[2:24:23] opened
[2:24:25] the the
[2:24:28] seventh there are so many
[2:24:31] books but when he
[2:24:34] open the
[2:24:38] seven it was
[2:24:44] all the seventh
[2:24:48] now you read about the seventh
[2:24:50] day the seventh Church
[2:24:53] age
[2:24:55] seven and the prophet says seven
[2:25:00] seven is
[2:25:03] a
[2:25:06] completion and there is always a mystery
[2:25:09] amen how
[2:25:13] would that's why at this seven Church
[2:25:20] age you have some
[2:25:24] Churches but there is a there
[2:25:29] is a SE there is the Seed of
[2:25:36] Abraham that's God's
[2:25:41] mystery hated
[2:25:45] by
[2:25:49] the real
[2:25:53] real
[2:25:57] seven because all these
[2:26:00] ages at the
[2:26:03] end you want to
[2:26:05] see the
[2:26:09] shape that the seven Church ages
[2:26:15] brought now can read about the
[2:26:19] first but the real real real
[2:26:22] thing go to the
[2:26:27] seventh it's a
[2:26:29] reflection of all these
[2:26:35] others because you count one
[2:26:41] to seven is the
[2:26:44] end we we we have read that in the
[2:26:47] book where it says when you hit
[2:26:52] seven where are you
[2:26:57] going when you come to
[2:27:01] seven that's
