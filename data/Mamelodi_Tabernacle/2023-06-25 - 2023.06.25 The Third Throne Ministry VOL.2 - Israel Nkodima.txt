Description:
Title: The Third Throne Ministry vol.2
Preached by Pastor Israel Nkodima on 25 June 2023 at Mamelodi Tabernacle

The purpose of this sermon was to show the audience about the Third Throne Ministry which is final Throne.  

The Pastor read the following scripture: Rev 3: 14 - 22

The message is beyond time. We have another body besides this body, and Christ is not knocking on the body of flesh but on the door in the heart.

Everyone is stronger in their positions and when we shift from our positions we become weaker.

If the seals are Revealed, they are Revealed in a threefold, which is God, Logos and Man. Every mystery of of God is in a threefold. 

If Christ is in you, you become sensitive to things around you.

The pastor also read the below quotes:
63-0728 Christ Is The Mystery Of God Revealed par 525 - 537
64-0802 The Future Home Of The Heavenly Bridegroom And The Earthly Bride par 222- 226 and 235 - 236

once again to speak to our hearts we ask all these blessings in a precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen amen a guy who may be seated God bless you amen amen the message is foreign [Music] because he doesn't knock at this body no or flesh and blood but he's looking another body amen amen because the message is um I I I looked at the book here of what do you call this Christ is the mystery of God revealed Christ is the mystery of God revealed now if then he is outside of the change and the book says we we we we will gather unto him meaning unto him outside that's why I will repeat something here I I was with a brother in Zimbabwe we were driving somewhere he was driving me somewhere now I asked him a question he said where is brother so foreign [Music] [Music] what do you say about the five-fold ministry and the brother knowing when Eastern points all right amen I don't know if you know about the faithful ministers did you know that an evangelist is somebody who goes outside he is the pastor of the ship [Music] foreign but if you find one is an evangelist he has to go out today I think we've got to uh we are blessed even with the church [Music] sometimes we are dealing with the people who even don't know about the church they don't read the church order they they have some positions in the church without the church order amen amen and I think you and the elders he took a time putting together quotations it was when I looked at it it was a wonderful way I had to put that together and if we starting from us the elders if we were able to read and look at the church I will know what to do amen amen but if you use the church order then we do things just the way we think amen amen [Music] now amen I think if only the only thing is that when we are preaching here we are preaching just to a small group not the other churches our our wedding here is going to the heart not to the church that's why some as they are talking about that five-fold minutes but they don't know what is okay all right we've got them yeah daddy prepared them for us we also don't make use of them we will go the other way okay let us go back to the church order yeah if each and every one of us you can get a copy of electricity and look at the church order I then amen all right order things go the other way all right God bless you Works in marriage now that's why a brother was asked a question [Music] then I realized that the brother don't read his church we are not all pastors we are not all evangelists amen amen so each and everyone whether it's an animal or a man he is strong in his position [Music] [Applause] do you know that once you shift from position then you become so weak and the devil can attack you attack yeah you all right amen now we should remain in our place even before we start off check for your position before we start off all right amen we have like we have young people here many of them don't read this book they don't bother themselves and then if you don't read these things Christian it's somebody who is Christ's life he reads his Bible he reads the way he prays every time and he doesn't commit sin he really had to receive it because sin is unbelief and believe is sin is that right amen now we have such people in the churches who actually are not Christians they know themselves I can do anything all right now let's look at this one with this everybody amen amen as he spoke to the last church [Music] I mean at the end of it all yeah um he now spoke to those as he says behold I stand at the door I'm out of the church now I'm just at the door yeah if any not any church but if any amen opens yeah so he's saying nothing about the chase he's talking about the individuals yeah Christ is the mystery of God revealed Christ is the mystery of God revealed it takes all about the individuals [Music] and we were close amen amen the service amen amen [Music] um and to the people because preaching is for those that are Beyond Time okay amen let me open the books now at what now let's look at this there's a part here in the Escape I'm not preaching I'm just talking to you all right I am I'm looking at a scripture here [Music] I'm looking at this book Church ages if you want to read you don't read to keep yourself busy [Music] it's for life Ahmed so now I'm reading this party that says yeah I'm going to read amen this is the record of God [Music] had given us eternal life [Music] and this life is in his son um he that had the Sun amen amen and without the sun you don't have life I will never pay um amen we want to separate um or a person who thinks that he is a Christian and a Christian amen amen we're talking about yeah he's he's talking about the record of eternal life all right is these things will be looking at this thing because what he gave was life eternal life okay and now there are some people who believe that they are Christians but there are also some people who are Christians it's two different things and one believes he's a Christian if you ask him why do you believe that you are a Christian can I go to Mommy [Music] I go to church every Sunday amen amen so I'm a Christian because I go to church not somebody who goes to jail is somebody who is in Christ Jesus Christ inside him that makes you a Christian amen right now as I read here it is the spirit telling us where Jesus is I wish you you'll take this you'll keep this in your house it is the spirit telling us where Jesus is Christ has left the church that is page three five seven good morning church ages he has left if the word is not let's come back now to our have you ever had that note because you are a house yourself it is from the church is outside of the church but looking at individuals I'm going to read it if you open the door I wonder if this morning your door is open you can open to foreign [Music] now I I'm reading from this book yeah [Music] brother this book is wonderful amen I haven't yet started reading just give me a chance I'm going to read this but this book Christ is the mystery of God revealed Christ is the mystery of God revealed wonderful I'm going to read some foreign he's talking here about the headship if we go back to a three-fold revelation more revelation we realize as he speaks here about the headship that is Christ healing and going back to the threefold revelations now this book Christ is the mystery of God revealed he's going to tell us about the headship or the threefold Revelation [Music] that's why I read this scripture you heard I'm standing at the door there's so many people in the churches but with close to doors I don't know how many doors [Music] come on a person in the church but the door is closed amen amen he's still going to do the same things you're still going to hate it the door is closed but he is a churchgoer he comes to church with a closed the door reading the Bible with a closed down amen now the Lord says open the door he wants to come here all right now I'm I'm going to look at this um and here is today in his word manifesting the same thing he did that yeah now the bright she can't recognize another headship now they said she takes you back to a three-fold Revelations the threefold revelations will never understand Revelation now we tried the threefold Revelation what it means at that day you shall know that I am in my father [Music] it is the man everybody who's not in the it is opening the threefolds Google all right amen so we read here the headship oh that's Christ healing Christ hey Christ I want to start here here it here he is today in his word manifesting the same thing he did that yeah she can't recognize another age because the bride of Christ have recognized YouTube now if we say the way we are not talking about when you are reading we are talking about that life in you is that right amen now I'm I'm I'm I'm looking at this yeah we are going to read things out of the same book okay amen and the message at the end time the Rapture is attend a house when you see the headships and the body coming to come becoming one treaty and the fullness of the measure of his manifestation the body is about ready to be received and to the headship that's why I'm saying that brother said God has blessed my brother he has also blessed us you say from you see today we we are we are trying not to say bad things about the other churches and their pastors we we are looking forward to our rapture if somebody don't see it is because God doesn't open his eyes not to say to talk about those people I'm I'm trying to talk about Jesus Christ because God if somebody my brother if God has revealed to him the same thing he has revealed to me scattered [Music] [Music] thank you Lord for saving my soul thank you Lord for revealing to me this word thank you for the Rapture thank you Lord for predestination thank you for coming back yeah that's what I can do as an individual I live even when I pray I don't forget to say thank you Lord for predestination [Applause] because it is not me God has been manifesting these things I recognize that he is in me and I recognize that I'm going in the Rapture [Applause] that's what makes you a Christian when you recognize that it was for you when he died he died for you his blood has cleansed you of all faith and you recognize that you are going in there amen amen not because the people are foreign [Applause] foreign [Music] did you know that you are blessed that you know about these things let me ask you a question um have you ever

fullness of his manifestation amen when sometimes in you I'll tell you something sometimes you know we pray I also pray but sometimes I even will jump off the bed to pray amen amen because there's

then you've got to go again happy and then it says into that a real genuine eternity amen I'm here to read to you today where the church is called that is where the church is called not to some station you know if you you are here you won't love a station [Music] where there's nothing else going on with just a rotation I'm bad I'm uh a person with eternal life cannot do remain in a merry-go-round true amen go again tribulations have you ever worshiped have you ever come through this it's a question whoa a true worship a Christian I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm we are going through we went through this I I mean in talking teaching on these things because the prophet says a teaching who puts you positionally positionally means you know when God is you are in position you know about the Battle foreign foreign yeah what is happening this is what is happening my wife this is the Battle of Madina is the white horse rider kids you understand that my wife does the Lord Jesus Christ taking around his wife and because the wife Musa is involved in these things the battle of Armageddon battle of Armageddon yeah we've seen some somewhere better who's against a man who fights [Music] amen well you can be they can show you where it will take place but it's hard for one to tell me who's fighting Lima all right amen you want me to tip you again the Millennium millennium but it won't be the one of uh the one that was brought by the seventh engine message [Music] do you know that now let's watch about you uh like I would sing a song yeah then after that I try to see it to sing it again then I would realize that hey it's not connecting then a brother tells me brother you know what um [Music] that song I I like to sing no no no no Hallelujah the next thing I try to sing it has changed now I try to I hear that no we are not even going there right yes this one the one you have heard now from the YouTube but you the original one you used to sing that's why since then I just kept quietly because mine was simply Hallelujah but it has changed then I asked then I said no I don't want to confuse the church because I'm singing the old style but now usually they it has gone taken another Direction it's no joyous celebration and I will try to sing another song and then it will go the other yeah I'll stop singing because it's no longer it's joyous celebration celebration okay so things like that okay you know we used to using those days to to sing in those days yeah [Music] because it's not that one of ours okay now I was saying about this thing now so the bride should know about the Millennium what's happening there for now the bride should know about this of the Book of Revelation Church [Applause] you know all this there were some codes and so forth I am I won't get much into that when they think that was my brother him we were talking about those quotes and I I said uh I wonder because he believed to me yeah I said you know because the bride yeah will be judging with the bright groups already goddess now the bride has to send the bride the documents [Music] amen amen amen actually how about you right things like this the bride of Christ they are only sent to the bride of Christ because the bridegroom once the bride to know since the bride is going to judge together with the bridegroom I I will read to you those things the king and the queen I've got it down yes you see the king and you know I've got to hear something where he says he's no longer a mediator but then I need to read it to you out of the spoken words that he is I'm going Horizon you know the thing you just come to the end now all these things they are only sent to the bride I mean foreign oh yeah my friend it's like that way shy because she's going to matter it's just it's just says um my wife the Rapture is this yeah [Music] now do you think any other woman will understand that's why have you had another woman is she can try talk about it she's going to mess it is exactly she will not bring the exact coconut even now I'm saying against man who is who against I don't believe any woman can answer that that's why Christians Christ said but worrying what do the people say when they are talking about me amen they said some say this some say this and he said what about you what do you say you get what I mean it goes like that some people say but by you are Jeremiah you are this you are not revealed but what do you say foreign time allowance you know amen we were talking I was talking even with another brother you say the battle of Armageddon who can tell us who is fighting who all right amen it's difficult but the bride can give you that all right it's all over I was trying to read this last thing because my time is up here amen foreign you'll see in the Bible the book was open even in the ancient of times in another book we went through that but it is you will not know it if you you were to say one thing I'm closing yeah there's two horse riders amen I mean have you get somebody talking about it there are things doesn't know anything about it the church is right the church does not anything about the Payless ride and what has it to do with the white horse you see these things so Julie be lined up here [Music] because there are days for the bride and there are days for the church amen it's different things that's why the bread the bride can start and they say they're a church but as it goes forward [Music] they separate themselves um since we worship s from another person I've not seen or seen ourselves separating ourselves from another person another person as a parade but we have seen [Applause] um that's why every brother is my brother [Music] these things individual I will come to because we are individuals when we talk about churches we still have to talk about the bride who is speak about it because she should be knowing the secret of these things she must know the secret cha we are putting them together their husbands that's why right here in these things okay amen already three and a half years three and a half years about something finally I'm through here you you you count seven you go into food eternity where the church is called not to some stations some denominations where you come from foreign foreign [Applause] [Music] but you have just recognized when it is revealed now all right amen and when the fullness of time has come that's when the time has been fulfilled [Music] where there is no more time then you go into it after the seven churches and it is and it is right amen will come back [Applause] Moody more why [Music] are you my sisters how do you know [Music] [Music] amen amen amen [Music] they should before the man of God thanks to God there's only one song to sing unto the
