[1:07:22] in the book of Isaiah chapter 9
[1:07:29] &gt;&gt; beginning with verse five
[1:07:32] &gt;&gt; and six.

[1:07:45] have sunk.
[1:07:46] &gt;&gt; Isaiah chapter 9 verse 5.
[1:07:49] [clears throat]
[1:07:50] &gt;&gt; Isaiah 9:5
[1:07:52] For every battle of the warrior is with
[1:07:55] confused noise and garments roll in
[1:07:58] blood, but this shall be with burning
[1:08:01] and fuel of fire.
[1:08:08] This is what the Bible says,
[1:08:12] &gt;&gt; just repeating it but in a French
[1:08:14] version.

[1:09:21] be called wonderful, counselor, the
[1:09:24] mighty God, the everlasting father, the
[1:09:27] prince of peace.
[1:09:29] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[1:09:33] Let's go to Proverbs
[1:09:38] &gt;&gt; chapter 15
[1:09:41] &gt;&gt; and verse 22.
[1:09:58] &gt;&gt; This is what it says.
[1:10:03] The pastor will read in the French, Dan
[1:10:05] will read in the English.
[1:10:20] Without the council, purposes are
[1:10:23] disappointed.
[1:10:25] But in the multitude of multitude of
[1:10:27] counselors, they are established.
[1:10:31] We shall pray.
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; God Almighty,
[1:10:40] &gt;&gt; we humbly come before you this morning.
[1:10:47] Every time that we stand before you on a
[1:10:50] Sunday in order to worship you,
[1:10:57] &gt;&gt; we always remember what you did for our
[1:11:00] redemption.
[1:11:05] &gt;&gt; Because you are the only one founder of
[1:11:08] a religion.
[1:11:13] Which religion left an empty tomb in
[1:11:16] Jerusalem?
[1:11:21] &gt;&gt; Muhammad his tomb is not empty.
[1:11:30] &gt;&gt; And all others, Buddha, Confucious and
[1:11:34] all others, they are in the tomb.
[1:11:40] &gt;&gt; But she came out of the tomb on the
[1:11:41] third day.
[1:11:46] And on a Sunday we come in order to
[1:11:49] commemorate of your resurrection.
[1:11:54] &gt;&gt; We bless your holy name.
[1:11:58] &gt;&gt; We bless your resurrection.
[1:12:01] We bless your presence.
[1:12:06] &gt;&gt; We bless you for the message of the
[1:12:08] hour.
[1:12:11] We bless you for the spoken word.
[1:12:15] We bless you for the seventh seal.
[1:12:21] &gt;&gt; We bless you for the works that pastor
[1:12:24] has done here
[1:12:28] and we do believe that his soul is
[1:12:30] resting in peace.
[1:12:33] Be with us, father,
[1:12:35] &gt;&gt; from the beginning all the way to the
[1:12:37] end.
[1:12:40] As I am going to make some noise,
[1:12:44] may you be with me.
[1:12:48] &gt;&gt; Be with my brother translating.
[1:12:53] May you give a good understanding to
[1:12:55] your children.
[1:12:57] May you get their hearts ready, Lord,
[1:13:01] &gt;&gt; in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:13:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[1:13:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[1:13:29] good. [applause]
[1:13:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:13:44] When the honorable Deacon Mete requested
[1:13:48] that I should bring the word this
[1:13:50] morning on this Sunday,
[1:13:57] I went all over trying to see what am I
[1:14:00] going to say.
[1:14:07] I do believe that you are not offended
[1:14:10] when I call deacons as honorable.
[1:14:17] [applause]
[1:14:25] Brother Brham is the one that calls or
[1:14:28] refers the deacon as honorable.
[1:14:38] &gt;&gt; Honorables are not those in a parliament
[1:14:41] but the true honorables are these ones
[1:14:43] that you have here.
[1:14:46] Hello.
[1:14:49] &gt;&gt; And I kept trying to see what am I going
[1:14:51] to say.
[1:14:55] I could not see the picture unfolding. I
[1:14:57] kept praying.
[1:15:01] But God by his grace gave me a little
[1:15:04] inspiration
[1:15:07] which I would like to share with you
[1:15:09] this morning.
[1:15:13] But considering that I have like a two
[1:15:15] hours,
[1:15:18] I'm going to try my best in order to
[1:15:20] finish as soon as possible
[1:15:23] because generally speaking.
[1:15:28] I am uh one of the kind of preachers who
[1:15:31] preach longer than you you could ever
[1:15:34] think.
[1:15:37] &gt;&gt; Sometimes when I shorten my preaching is
[1:15:39] a four hours.
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; [laughter]
[1:15:45] &gt;&gt; So feel comfortable.
[1:15:50] &gt;&gt; Feel comfortable. And I believe that my
[1:15:53] patriarch pastor
[1:15:58] was not a preacher who would shorten his
[1:16:01] preaching and preach for 30 minutes.
[1:16:05] Pastor Kim would take his time.
[1:16:14] So I remember when he came to Mati
[1:16:18] when he climbed the pulpit
[1:16:21] &gt;&gt; he spoke slowly but surely
[1:16:28] &gt;&gt; to us as he spoke so slowly we thought
[1:16:31] he was going to end the preaching in the
[1:16:33] next 2 minute 10 minutes or 20 minutes
[1:16:38] 1
[1:16:39] Second hour, three hours
[1:16:46] and my church all together. They said
[1:16:48] this is one of our family member.
[1:16:54] [applause]
[1:16:56] But I promise I am not going to be long.
[1:17:01] &gt;&gt; But please,
[1:17:03] I need your favor.
[1:17:06] And the favor that I want from you is
[1:17:08] your attention.
[1:17:15] &gt;&gt; So this morning I would like to speak.
[1:17:23] &gt;&gt; I would like to speak on the subject of
[1:17:26] the advisor's advice in the tabernacle.
[1:17:36] because I thought that I should just
[1:17:39] give you an advice
[1:17:47] because I might to preach I might touch
[1:17:50] here and there but considering the time
[1:17:53] that you are going through
[1:17:56] &gt;&gt; you need one thing and that is an
[1:17:58] advice.
[1:18:02] Do you need a counsel?
[1:18:07] &gt;&gt; You shall see here in the Bible.
[1:18:12] &gt;&gt; Where we from reading? Isaiah chapter 9.
[1:18:17] &gt;&gt; And you know that Isaiah was or is a
[1:18:21] great prophet
[1:18:26] &gt;&gt; on his own. He preached the entire
[1:18:29] Bible.
[1:18:33] says that Isaiah himself preached about
[1:18:36] the creation.
[1:18:42] Isaiah spoke of the creation
[1:18:46] and he also spoke about the fall of the
[1:18:49] man.
[1:18:51] He spoke of the redeemer
[1:18:55] and he also spoke of the rapture.
[1:18:59] It touched the millennium
[1:19:02] and he also spoke of hell.
[1:19:07] So notice the Bible that we have here.
[1:19:11] &gt;&gt; This Bible has got a 66 books.
[1:19:17] Any other book that has got no 66 books,
[1:19:25] &gt;&gt; these are the added Bibles. They are
[1:19:27] fake Bibles.
[1:19:30] &gt;&gt; So these are fake Bibles.
[1:19:33] &gt;&gt; But they shoot the genuine Bible.
[1:19:36] &gt;&gt; The original Bible
[1:19:39] &gt;&gt; has got a six 66 books.
[1:19:44] If you got the Bible like Toby,
[1:19:50] they have spoken of the wisdom or
[1:19:53] justice and makabi.
[1:19:58] These are added books.
[1:20:02] &gt;&gt; But the true Bible has got 66 books.
[1:20:10] And Isaiah has written 60 books
[1:20:14] shortened in this Bible.
[1:20:17] Now notice one thing.
[1:20:21] While he was announcing the coming of
[1:20:23] the redeemer,
[1:20:26] So our redeemer
[1:20:28] before he could even come the prophet
[1:20:32] Isaiah the prophet spoke of his coming.
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; And as he spoke of his coming,
[1:20:42] he told us, he showed us what would be
[1:20:44] his attributes,
[1:20:48] what would be the works of the redeemer.
[1:20:51] &gt;&gt; So this is what he say.
[1:20:55] Notice the prophetical characteristics
[1:20:58] of this redeemer.
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; Notice here.
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; This is what he says a child is born
[1:21:07] unto us.
[1:21:09] &gt;&gt; Notice
[1:21:12] he never say that the child shall come.
[1:21:19] This is a present tense. A child is born
[1:21:21] unto us.
[1:21:24] praise and dance.
[1:21:26] And I believe on that day,
[1:21:30] people had gone to the hospital
[1:21:33] to see
[1:21:35] because he say that a child was born.
[1:21:40] One le what he said in the present time,
[1:21:47] it was something that was to take a
[1:21:49] place 700 years later.
[1:21:53] That's the reason why
[1:21:55] as soon as you receive a prophet,
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; be careful. Pay attention to the
[1:22:03] prophetical language
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; because the prophet is someone
[1:22:11] is someone who lives in two different
[1:22:14] worlds at the same time.
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; He could be at the same time in
[1:22:20] eternity.
[1:22:23] He sees the things in eternity.
[1:22:26] At the same time, he's living in time.
[1:22:29] That's why
[1:22:31] when he a prophet speaks,
[1:22:35] he could be speaking of things he so in
[1:22:37] detected.
[1:22:39] He speaks as if though they were in the
[1:22:41] prison.
[1:22:44] So you must be ignorant
[1:22:47] &gt;&gt; in order to go high and see and
[1:22:51] understand
[1:22:53] what he is trying to say.
[1:22:56] &gt;&gt; Jesus would say,
[1:22:59] &gt;&gt; no one has ever seen the father
[1:23:02] except the son
[1:23:05] which came down from the father.
[1:23:08] The son which came from heaven
[1:23:12] and which is now in heaven.
[1:23:17] Yet he said he was in heaven.
[1:23:20] &gt;&gt; He was before them saying he was in
[1:23:22] heaven
[1:23:24] standing before them yet saying that he
[1:23:26] was in heaven.
[1:23:29] But in what kind of heaven was that?
[1:23:32] &gt;&gt; It was not the skies.
[1:23:35] It meant that he was in a different
[1:23:37] dimension.
[1:23:41] That is why
[1:23:43] &gt;&gt; a prophet
[1:23:45] for you to understand well the prophet
[1:23:50] you must be or it takes a prophetical
[1:23:53] people.
[1:23:54] So here he says a child is born unto us.
[1:23:59] A son is given unto
[1:24:02] present tense. He is born. Is given
[1:24:08] &gt;&gt; but dominion
[1:24:11] &gt;&gt; shall see dominion shall
[1:24:16] &gt;&gt; in the same chapter.
[1:24:18] He speaks of the present
[1:24:21] and he also touches the future
[1:24:24] at the same time.
[1:24:27] &gt;&gt; Dominion
[1:24:29] shall rest upon his shoulder.
[1:24:32] &gt;&gt; He shall be called
[1:24:34] &gt;&gt; admirable.
[1:24:37] &gt;&gt; Now this is what he says. He shall be
[1:24:38] called
[1:24:40] &gt;&gt; um he shall be called the admirable
[1:24:44] &gt;&gt; counselor
[1:24:49] mighty God,
[1:24:52] &gt;&gt; everlasting father,
[1:24:55] &gt;&gt; prince of peace,
[1:24:59] But we this morning are going to speak
[1:25:01] about the counselor, the advisor.
[1:25:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:06] &gt;&gt; A counselor, the adviser,
[1:25:09] &gt;&gt; that's the reason why you shall not see.
[1:25:13] If you are in a message,
[1:25:17] if you look in a message more than
[1:25:20] events made clear by prophecy
[1:25:24] says something there
[1:25:27] that Jesus was the counselor
[1:25:31] today in the message events
[1:25:35] I'm not going to be reading a lot so as
[1:25:38] to say much. So who is a counselor?
[1:25:42] See,
[1:25:46] when you see in all these big
[1:25:48] governments of the world,
[1:25:51] the first thing you see is the president
[1:25:54] of the country.
[1:25:57] But all around him is good advises,
[1:25:59] counselors,
[1:26:00] a counselor
[1:26:04] is a very important man
[1:26:08] even in the Old Testament.
[1:26:12] We see kings in the Bible.
[1:26:16] Those kings had counselors.
[1:26:20] &gt;&gt; If you see consider that David's life,
[1:26:25] &gt;&gt; you shall see that David of old, he had
[1:26:27] a mighty counselor.
[1:26:30] The the the the Bible speaks of
[1:26:35] Ashel.
[1:26:38] &gt;&gt; He was a mighty counselor.
[1:26:41] and who was close to David
[1:26:46] counselors they earn higher salaries.
[1:26:51] These are the people that you do not see
[1:26:52] with your eyes.
[1:26:55] &gt;&gt; They are not even occupying some seats
[1:26:58] in the ministry.
[1:27:00] &gt;&gt; They are not ministers.
[1:27:02] &gt;&gt; They are not the prime ministers.
[1:27:06] &gt;&gt; But everything a president is trying to
[1:27:08] do
[1:27:10] in any kind of domain
[1:27:14] he has to go through counselors first.
[1:27:18] That is why
[1:27:20] &gt;&gt; the president have got counselors
[1:27:24] uh in a health domain,
[1:27:28] &gt;&gt; a military counselor
[1:27:32] in all the domains that you may list to
[1:27:35] say that
[1:27:37] before a president could do anything,
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; he calls the counselor for that
[1:27:44] particular domain.
[1:27:46] &gt;&gt; He says now
[1:27:49] electricity.
[1:27:49] &gt;&gt; We would like for example to invest
[1:27:52] money in electricity
[1:27:55] or in health.
[1:27:57] But you
[1:28:00] know how it works this domain how it
[1:28:02] works. What shall we do?
[1:28:07] You you see you only see a president
[1:28:09] standing before the people and say this
[1:28:12] is what we're going to do. This is this
[1:28:15] is what we're going to do. Well,
[1:28:19] he did not he is not skilled in
[1:28:22] electricity.
[1:28:25] &gt;&gt; He did not he is not a doctor.
[1:28:29] &gt;&gt; But what he tells you about medicine
[1:28:33] all these come from the counselor.
[1:28:36] That's right.
[1:28:38] This ministry of counseling
[1:28:42] is so important
[1:28:45] that to the extent that the Bible tells
[1:28:46] us
[1:28:48] that if the plans,
[1:28:52] should you have a plan
[1:28:55] and that plan of yours fails,
[1:29:02] it's a lack of advisers or counselors.
[1:29:05] It means
[1:29:07] a group of people sitting down
[1:29:11] tableling the mater
[1:29:14] and trying to see what advice to give.
[1:29:18] &gt;&gt; And this is what he says.
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; He says, "But
[1:29:23] a plan may succeed
[1:29:28] may succeed only when there's many
[1:29:30] counselors."
[1:29:33] This one adds another one speaks.
[1:29:37] Another one speaks.
[1:29:40] But brother when he came, he says it
[1:29:43] that
[1:29:45] this is the domain of war
[1:29:49] for battle.
[1:29:51] We need many counselors.
[1:29:56] So that for each weapon there is a
[1:29:59] counselor.
[1:30:01] But when it comes to salvation,
[1:30:04] &gt;&gt; redemption,
[1:30:07] we only have one counselor
[1:30:11] which is the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:30:14] He is our counselor.
[1:30:16] Now notice
[1:30:19] often times we fail
[1:30:27] &gt;&gt; because we fail because we do not we do
[1:30:29] not want to exploit the attributes of
[1:30:32] counselor.
[1:30:34] We fail.
[1:30:36] We fix him to marry.
[1:30:39] We've got a counselor
[1:30:41] which is the Lord Jesus.
[1:30:44] But how does a Jesus counselor
[1:30:48] how are you or where are you going to
[1:30:50] meet Jesus
[1:30:51] in your room
[1:30:54] expecting him to walk out
[1:30:57] &gt;&gt; to give you advice?
[1:31:00] But listen, Jesus advises us
[1:31:04] &gt;&gt; through his servants,
[1:31:08] [cheering]
[1:31:11] &gt;&gt; through our pastors,
[1:31:14] &gt;&gt; they are the ones
[1:31:18] in which God or to which God gives uh
[1:31:22] counel counsel.
[1:31:25] &gt;&gt; Jesus speaks through them.
[1:31:28] &gt;&gt; Notice Notice
[1:31:32] advisor they are very expensive.
[1:31:36] They get more money
[1:31:39] to have a counselor.
[1:31:42] These are very important people. They
[1:31:43] are very expensive.
[1:31:45] But notice a president
[1:31:49] might have many counselors.
[1:31:52] This cost him more money.
[1:31:55] But in the church,
[1:31:58] God gives you the best counselor.
[1:32:03] And when you come for counseling,
[1:32:07] &gt;&gt; he doesn't require money from you.
[1:32:11] He gives you advices free of charge.
[1:32:16] But often times,
[1:32:20] &gt;&gt; we fail to even go to our pastors and
[1:32:22] ask for advisor.
[1:32:25] We are we want to get married.
[1:32:28] &gt;&gt; We open our eyes.
[1:32:31] looking
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; the one that is for brown color
[1:32:37] &gt;&gt; and the one dark color,
[1:32:40] &gt;&gt; the the the slender one.
[1:32:43] &gt;&gt; While God
[1:32:46] in order for God to give a woman to
[1:32:49] Adam,
[1:32:52] God caused Adam to fall into a deep
[1:32:55] sleeper first.
[1:32:59] &gt;&gt; Adam's eyes were not open.
[1:33:03] Adam could hardly see.
[1:33:06] &gt;&gt; He left the God.
[1:33:09] &gt;&gt; Adam suffered God to do the work.
[1:33:13] &gt;&gt; But when God woke Adam up,
[1:33:16] &gt;&gt; Adam looks
[1:33:19] and he says, see right now, behold now
[1:33:23] that which is the flesh of my
[1:33:26] was not with a naked eyes
[1:33:29] because he was asleep.
[1:33:31] But we
[1:33:33] leave pastors aside,
[1:33:35] &gt;&gt; ministers aside,
[1:33:37] &gt;&gt; the Lord aside,
[1:33:40] &gt;&gt; we ask nothing as advice.
[1:33:42] &gt;&gt; And here we are.
[1:33:48] Amen.
[1:33:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:51] &gt;&gt; Like right now
[1:33:55] is in a period of transition.
[1:33:59] In this transition,
[1:34:02] you need an advisor
[1:34:06] and the counselor that I give you.
[1:34:09] Meanwhile,
[1:34:12] the the counselor that I'm going to give
[1:34:14] you right now, meantime, don't have your
[1:34:16] eyes open.
[1:34:19] Have your eyes closed
[1:34:21] every day.
[1:34:23] &gt;&gt; On your knees,
[1:34:26] &gt;&gt; praying, Lord,
[1:34:28] &gt;&gt; Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord.
[1:34:34] Because the minute you have your eyes
[1:34:35] wide open,
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; you will put your your your your cannon
[1:34:40] feelings.
[1:34:43] &gt;&gt; You will desire.
[1:34:46] This one is out of my tribe.
[1:34:51] So this one only.
[1:34:53] &gt;&gt; That is why
[1:34:56] we need our eyes to be closed.
[1:34:59] to pray unto God
[1:35:01] &gt;&gt; to ask Lord,
[1:35:03] &gt;&gt; Lord, what is your will?
[1:35:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. [cheering]
[1:35:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:08] &gt;&gt; The counselor.
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:14] &gt;&gt; So, what is my counsel to you this
[1:35:16] morning?
[1:35:18] I'm going to speak on four major points
[1:35:23] that you need to take with you as a
[1:35:25] councils.
[1:35:27] transition
[1:35:28] &gt;&gt; for your transitions
[1:35:33] &gt;&gt; in order to have a safe landing
[1:35:40] &gt;&gt; in our daily life.
[1:35:45] The most difficult stage in one's life
[1:35:51] &gt;&gt; is that period of transition.
[1:35:55] &gt;&gt; Notice
[1:35:57] says this.
[1:35:59] When you give a birth to a child,
[1:36:03] &gt;&gt; this a child has to go through three
[1:36:05] stages.
[1:36:07] &gt;&gt; The first age
[1:36:10] is at the age of a childhood.
[1:36:14] He is a child
[1:36:17] depending on the parents
[1:36:20] living under the parents rules. She's
[1:36:23] being carried, being cared for.
[1:36:26] says this age,
[1:36:29] &gt;&gt; it's the age of innocency
[1:36:33] where the child knows nothing.
[1:36:37] &gt;&gt; This is the the the age of a childhood.
[1:36:42] We show them how to we train them how to
[1:36:44] brush,
[1:36:47] how to put on a shirt or t-shirt,
[1:36:50] how to eat.
[1:36:53] This is the age of the childhood.
[1:36:57] Now going beyond that age,
[1:37:00] there is another age which is of adult.
[1:37:05] As an adult, he doesn't need anyone to
[1:37:08] show him how to brush.
[1:37:11] He doesn't need someone to teach him how
[1:37:13] to eat
[1:37:16] himself. Decides.
[1:37:19] But notice
[1:37:23] &gt;&gt; between the age of the childhood
[1:37:27] and the adult age.
[1:37:32] &gt;&gt; In between there's an age of transition
[1:37:38] which is the age of a teenagers.
[1:37:44] And the brother says that the teenage,
[1:37:48] &gt;&gt; a child,
[1:37:49] &gt;&gt; a boy
[1:37:51] &gt;&gt; or a girl,
[1:37:54] &gt;&gt; they step into the age of foolishness or
[1:37:58] phony.
[1:38:01] They are lost. They don't even know what
[1:38:02] they have to do.
[1:38:05] They follow this one. Follow that one.
[1:38:06] Follow the other one. When he sees this,
[1:38:09] they follow.
[1:38:11] &gt;&gt; When he sees the other thing, he goes
[1:38:13] out.
[1:38:14] They copy. They're copying from each
[1:38:16] other. That's why
[1:38:20] &gt;&gt; please don't have your your eyes
[1:38:22] elsewhere.
[1:38:26] &gt;&gt; Focus on the master.
[1:38:28] [cheering]
[1:38:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:32] Now listen.
[1:38:34] &gt;&gt; So during this time,
[1:38:38] &gt;&gt; we need four major points.
[1:38:41] First,
[1:38:45] &gt;&gt; the importance of a family
[1:38:55] &gt;&gt; as a family.
[1:39:01] I want us understand this this morning
[1:39:05] &gt;&gt; that as we are seated here,
[1:39:08] &gt;&gt; we are a family.
[1:39:15] This is the first point.
[1:39:18] If every single one of you could
[1:39:20] understand that we are a family,
[1:39:25] &gt;&gt; each family
[1:39:27] &gt;&gt; has the ups
[1:39:29] &gt;&gt; and downs,
[1:39:32] &gt;&gt; has a problems,
[1:39:34] &gt;&gt; has a difficulties,
[1:39:36] &gt;&gt; but
[1:39:38] despite the ups
[1:39:40] &gt;&gt; and downs,
[1:39:42] &gt;&gt; we still stick together as a family.
[1:39:49] Amen.
[1:39:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:52] &gt;&gt; You still a family.
[1:39:55] &gt;&gt; This is my first appointment.
[1:39:57] &gt;&gt; The second one.
[1:40:01] &gt;&gt; The second character
[1:40:05] &gt;&gt; which gives power or strength to the
[1:40:08] family. Any given family
[1:40:11] &gt;&gt; that which gives a strength to the
[1:40:13] family is unity.
[1:40:17] Amen.
[1:40:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:19] Notice
[1:40:23] &gt;&gt; God has given us two instruments in the
[1:40:26] body
[1:40:28] &gt;&gt; which helps us which help us to do
[1:40:30] anything we we want.
[1:40:33] If I'm having a mind of working
[1:40:36] whether in an office,
[1:40:38] &gt;&gt; God has given us two hands.
[1:40:41] &gt;&gt; These are two hands.
[1:40:44] &gt;&gt; They are being equipped with a 10 toes
[1:40:49] &gt;&gt; 10 or fingers
[1:40:53] &gt;&gt; and these 10 fingers.
[1:40:58] None of these fingers can perform the
[1:41:01] work on its own.
[1:41:04] &gt;&gt; No, it cannot do that.
[1:41:07] &gt;&gt; For the work to be well done,
[1:41:11] &gt;&gt; we need all these fingers. Notice
[1:41:16] he that go decide to go into the field
[1:41:20] when he he takes the who
[1:41:25] &gt;&gt; or the sword you don't take it with that
[1:41:27] one finger
[1:41:30] &gt;&gt; but you take the sword with it all the
[1:41:32] five fingers.
[1:41:36] So when you take it this way,
[1:41:40] all the fingers as one family
[1:41:44] in unity
[1:41:46] when you grow
[1:41:48] then you work.
[1:41:50] See
[1:41:52] when you come
[1:41:55] when you go into the field you see that
[1:41:56] the work is moving forward
[1:42:00] if you need to cut down a tree
[1:42:04] &gt;&gt; and that you are not as powerful as you
[1:42:07] should be to cut down the tree what do
[1:42:09] you what do you do the you take the axe
[1:42:15] now you need the help of this other hand
[1:42:19] &gt;&gt; this one comes
[1:42:20] That's when it comes then you hold it
[1:42:23] with a tool cutting down the tree
[1:42:27] cutting down the tree.
[1:42:28] &gt;&gt; That is why
[1:42:31] men in the world what do they say union
[1:42:36] unity
[1:42:38] &gt;&gt; is a strength.
[1:42:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:42:47] Now the third point that we're going to
[1:42:49] exploit
[1:42:51] &gt;&gt; is love.
[1:42:55] &gt;&gt; A family.
[1:42:57] &gt;&gt; First point the family.
[1:43:00] &gt;&gt; Secondly the unity in the family
[1:43:03] on the third point
[1:43:05] love in the same family.
[1:43:08] I am not talking about that love
[1:43:12] whereby you give me a drink
[1:43:15] because I'm thirsty
[1:43:18] &gt;&gt; or you give me food.
[1:43:20] &gt;&gt; No,
[1:43:22] that is not the kind of love I'm talking
[1:43:24] about.
[1:43:25] &gt;&gt; Because the Apostle Paul says
[1:43:30] even when I will be able to give up to
[1:43:32] give out my food,
[1:43:36] &gt;&gt; give my food to the poor.
[1:43:39] But if I fail to have love,
[1:43:42] it is nothing.
[1:43:44] So how is it that
[1:43:47] someone gives all he has as a food
[1:43:51] and that kind of person failing to have
[1:43:53] love?
[1:43:55] You know what love
[1:43:58] &gt;&gt; is something else?
[1:44:00] The kind of love I'm talking about
[1:44:03] &gt;&gt; is the seventh seal.
[1:44:07] &gt;&gt; The capstone.
[1:44:10] &gt;&gt; This capstone that you see over there
[1:44:15] says the capstone
[1:44:18] that is a divine love.
[1:44:23] When the capstone comes down
[1:44:31] The capstone unites the entire body
[1:44:34] around it.
[1:44:37] &gt;&gt; The capstone
[1:44:39] &gt;&gt; it comes down
[1:44:41] &gt;&gt; with unity with oneness.
[1:44:44] Amen.
[1:44:49] &gt;&gt; And the last point of the four,
[1:44:54] &gt;&gt; it is that which you call Leonip.
[1:45:01] &gt;&gt; Yes, it's in a Hebrew word. It's a
[1:45:03] Hebrew word.
[1:45:07] &gt;&gt; And what is it?
[1:45:10] &gt;&gt; Yumipur.
[1:45:12] It is a feast
[1:45:16] &gt;&gt; which is happening in Israel
[1:45:19] ever since
[1:45:22] &gt;&gt; it happens in the month of October
[1:45:25] &gt;&gt; and that feast
[1:45:28] &gt;&gt; it's a a great feast
[1:45:32] &gt;&gt; in the French
[1:45:34] &gt;&gt; or in both the French and English
[1:45:39] is being translated as
[1:45:44] as the feast of the great pardon,
[1:45:53] &gt;&gt; a great pardon,
[1:45:57] &gt;&gt; that feast,
[1:45:59] &gt;&gt; the children of Israel would come
[1:46:01] together
[1:46:05] &gt;&gt; and that day they would forgive each
[1:46:07] other.
[1:46:10] Now you shall see that brother
[1:46:15] in his ministry
[1:46:19] on October
[1:46:20] &gt;&gt; in October
[1:46:23] &gt;&gt; 28th of October 1963
[1:46:27] almost the same period as the Hebrews
[1:46:31] preach the message
[1:46:33] &gt;&gt; pardon
[1:46:42] Is there anyone here that has had that
[1:46:45] opportunity of reading this message
[1:46:47] entitled pardon? Has anyone here ever
[1:46:50] read that message? Pardon?
[1:46:53] &gt;&gt; Pardon?
[1:46:55] You shall notice
[1:46:57] &gt;&gt; that each family,
[1:47:01] &gt;&gt; each family is not immune to problems.
[1:47:06] &gt;&gt; There's always a problems in every
[1:47:07] family.
[1:47:09] &gt;&gt; Every each family has got problems.
[1:47:13] Sometimes it's a father against a mother
[1:47:17] or a mother with a children.
[1:47:21] But why is it that they still stick
[1:47:23] together as a united family?
[1:47:25] &gt;&gt; It's only because in the family
[1:47:28] there's something in the family
[1:47:31] &gt;&gt; that washes all the indifferences
[1:47:35] &gt;&gt; and that thing
[1:47:37] it's called the pardon.
[1:47:41] That's why back home in the Congo,
[1:47:46] we've got our natural uh proverb that
[1:47:49] says
[1:47:52] That says that dirty clothes,
[1:47:56] &gt;&gt; dirty clothes
[1:47:59] &gt;&gt; are not are not washed on the streets,
[1:48:04] &gt;&gt; but dirty clothes
[1:48:06] &gt;&gt; are washed in a as a family
[1:48:10] together.
[1:48:14] &gt;&gt; You see someone with a nice top, nice
[1:48:16] blouse,
[1:48:18] &gt;&gt; so clean, tidy,
[1:48:21] But way did she wash it?
[1:48:24] &gt;&gt; In family. He washed it in family.
[1:48:28] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:48:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:48:33] &gt;&gt; Now, let's speak of the family.
[1:48:35] &gt;&gt; Let's go to the Bible.
[1:48:38] &gt;&gt; Genesis chapter 12.
[1:48:42] &gt;&gt; Are we going to speak a bit here and
[1:48:44] there in order to come to an end?
[1:48:48] We still have sufficient time.
[1:48:51] &gt;&gt; Genesis chapter 12.
[1:48:53] &gt;&gt; This is what God says.
[1:48:55] &gt;&gt; Now listen to what he says.
[1:48:58] &gt;&gt; Uh 12 verse one.
[1:49:07] &gt;&gt; The Lord had said to Abraham, "No, no,
[1:49:09] no, no pardon.
[1:49:10] &gt;&gt; No, no, please. I'm sorry.
[1:49:13] &gt;&gt; I was reading in Exodus.
[1:49:41] The Lord had said to Abraham, "Go from
[1:49:44] your country, your people, and your
[1:49:47] father's household to the land I will
[1:49:49] show you. I will make you into a great
[1:49:52] nation, and I will bless you. I will
[1:49:54] make your name great, and you'll be a
[1:49:57] blessing.
[1:49:59] &gt;&gt; Imagine it.
[1:49:59] &gt;&gt; Now, imagine
[1:50:02] &gt;&gt; a single man,
[1:50:05] &gt;&gt; that is to be a source,
[1:50:11] &gt;&gt; of a blessing.
[1:50:14] Now listen
[1:50:19] verse three. I will bless those
[1:50:25] &gt;&gt; who bless you and whoever curses you I
[1:50:28] will curse. Verse three.
[1:50:34] &gt;&gt; And all peoples on earth,
[1:50:40] &gt;&gt; in thee shall all families of the earth
[1:50:43] be blessed.
[1:50:46] &gt;&gt; Now imagine
[1:50:49] all the families of the earth
[1:50:54] &gt;&gt; will be blessed or are to be blessed
[1:50:56] thanks to one family.
[1:50:59] So first the blessing
[1:51:03] &gt;&gt; comes out of a single family
[1:51:07] from that single family.
[1:51:10] &gt;&gt; All other families on earth
[1:51:13] &gt;&gt; to be blessed thanks to that first
[1:51:15] family.
[1:51:17] That is why
[1:51:20] we all say
[1:51:22] &gt;&gt; that we are the children of Abraham.
[1:51:25] &gt;&gt; Now notice notice Abraham's
[1:51:30] a family
[1:51:32] is a blessed family faced
[1:51:36] and out of this family all other
[1:51:39] families will be blessed.
[1:51:41] &gt;&gt; Now notice that the natural
[1:51:45] typifies the supernatural.
[1:51:48] &gt;&gt; The natural
[1:51:51] shows what is in the supernatural.
[1:51:54] That is the reason why
[1:51:57] &gt;&gt; that Abraham's a family
[1:52:00] everything given to that family by God
[1:52:04] &gt;&gt; from that family
[1:52:06] that are blessings would spread and what
[1:52:09] are these blessings
[1:52:11] notice that
[1:52:14] in the plan of redemption
[1:52:18] all the spiritual blessings
[1:52:21] they are tied to Abraham am.
[1:52:24] That's why salvation,
[1:52:27] the salvation we looking for,
[1:52:29] the eternal life that we are looking for
[1:52:33] in the Old Testament,
[1:52:37] it was represented by the land of Canaan
[1:52:42] which is called a promised landm
[1:52:46] But notice that the promised land
[1:52:50] in the New Testament says,
[1:52:53] &gt;&gt; the promised land in the New Testament
[1:52:55] is the baptism of the Holy Spirit.
[1:52:59] &gt;&gt; The baptism of the Holy Spirit
[1:53:02] &gt;&gt; is our promised land.
[1:53:05] There there is where we go into. But
[1:53:07] notice
[1:53:09] &gt;&gt; this promised land.
[1:53:12] &gt;&gt; To whom was it given to first?
[1:53:17] To whom was it given?
[1:53:19] There's a promised land.
[1:53:22] &gt;&gt; God had given it to a single man
[1:53:25] &gt;&gt; to a family.
[1:53:28] And notice that out of that family,
[1:53:32] &gt;&gt; that family that was to possess the
[1:53:34] promised landm
[1:53:39] &gt;&gt; became an inheritance.
[1:53:44] So if we touch the inheritance,
[1:53:48] each inheritance,
[1:53:51] &gt;&gt; those that are to inherit,
[1:53:54] &gt;&gt; they must come out of that family.
[1:53:59] If you're not of that family,
[1:54:02] you cannot inherit anything.
[1:54:05] You cannot possess anything.
[1:54:08] You need to be out of that family to
[1:54:09] reach.
[1:54:11] So in the message adoption,
[1:54:14] &gt;&gt; adoption
[1:54:16] the second part
[1:54:20] I did not give this quotation but the
[1:54:22] brother can
[1:54:25] I give other quotations but
[1:54:30] the book of Ephesians is comparable to
[1:54:32] the book of Joshua
[1:54:35] &gt;&gt; preached on the 15th
[1:54:38] &gt;&gt; of May 1960.
[1:54:41] Evening
[1:54:43] evening
[1:54:45] in the morning, brother Bham preached
[1:54:47] the message the rejected king
[1:54:49] &gt;&gt; the same date.
[1:54:51] &gt;&gt; But here
[1:54:54] the book of
[1:54:56] &gt;&gt; is preached on the same day but in the
[1:54:58] evening.
[1:55:00] &gt;&gt; Now this is what the prophet says.
[1:55:02] &gt;&gt; It means adoption. The second part he
[1:55:05] says
[1:55:08] &gt;&gt; quotation 35.
[1:55:13] &gt;&gt; So then I typified this book
[1:55:16] &gt;&gt; with that of Joshua.
[1:55:18] &gt;&gt; If you notice,
[1:55:22] Israel came out of Egypt
[1:55:27] and on the journey they had this journey
[1:55:29] had three stages or three steps.
[1:55:32] The first stage
[1:55:35] &gt;&gt; was that which of Egypt,
[1:55:39] &gt;&gt; the next stage,
[1:55:40] &gt;&gt; the wilderness.
[1:55:44] And the third stage
[1:55:46] &gt;&gt; was a canon.
[1:55:49] While canon
[1:55:52] &gt;&gt; does not represent the age of
[1:55:54] millennium,
[1:55:58] &gt;&gt; but a canon rather represents
[1:56:01] &gt;&gt; the age of the overcomers,
[1:56:05] &gt;&gt; the dispensation of the victory
[1:56:09] because in a canon land they killed.
[1:56:14] &gt;&gt; They burnt the cities.
[1:56:16] They got they took a city
[1:56:22] but in the millennium there shall not be
[1:56:24] death
[1:56:27] &gt;&gt; and more
[1:56:29] &gt;&gt; canon
[1:56:30] &gt;&gt; what canon does
[1:56:35] shows us justification
[1:56:41] moving from Egypt all the way to the Red
[1:56:43] Sea
[1:56:45] &gt;&gt; getting through water.
[1:56:48] This represents justification
[1:56:51] by faith.
[1:56:54] after they had believed in Moses
[1:56:58] and decided to leave Egypt,
[1:57:03] &gt;&gt; sanctification.
[1:57:08] &gt;&gt; As they marched under the leadership of
[1:57:11] the purifier
[1:57:14] and under the atonement of the lamb
[1:57:16] sacrifice,
[1:57:17] &gt;&gt; the the sacrificial lamb
[1:57:20] &gt;&gt; in the wilderness.
[1:57:22] Then
[1:57:25] Then the third step they walked into the
[1:57:28] land
[1:57:29] &gt;&gt; which is a canon. Canon is a land
[1:57:33] is a land that which was promised. Now
[1:57:37] listen. Oh
[1:57:38] &gt;&gt; well.
[1:57:43] What is the land which had been a
[1:57:46] promise to believers today?
[1:57:49] &gt;&gt; To believers of the New Testament.
[1:57:52] What is the country?
[1:57:55] What is your land?
[1:57:57] &gt;&gt; What is your promised land?
[1:58:01] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:58:04] &gt;&gt; Says,
[1:58:05] &gt;&gt; he says,
[1:58:07] &gt;&gt; the promise
[1:58:11] &gt;&gt; is but the baptism of the Holy Spirit.
[1:58:14] That is the promise
[1:58:16] &gt;&gt; because
[1:58:18] to the last days
[1:58:21] &gt;&gt; Joel 2:28 says
[1:58:25] &gt;&gt; on the last days I will pour down on my
[1:58:28] of my spirit
[1:58:30] on all flesh.
[1:58:33] So canon land today
[1:58:36] is the baptism of the Holy Spirit. Now
[1:58:38] notice
[1:58:40] when the canon was the first a promise
[1:58:43] &gt;&gt; it was a promise to a man. Oh yes
[1:58:46] &gt;&gt; it was a family
[1:58:49] &gt;&gt; and that person was Abraham.
[1:58:52] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:58:54] &gt;&gt; It was a promise to Abraham. me.
[1:58:56] &gt;&gt; Abraham stood for a family
[1:59:00] &gt;&gt; and out of that
[1:59:02] &gt;&gt; out of that natural promise
[1:59:06] &gt;&gt; which was an inheritance to Abraham.
[1:59:09] &gt;&gt; Notice
[1:59:11] that inheritance
[1:59:14] moved or went from Abraham
[1:59:17] &gt;&gt; to Isaac. Moved from Abraham to Isaac.
[1:59:21] &gt;&gt; And who was Isaac?
[1:59:22] &gt;&gt; Abraham
[1:59:23] &gt;&gt; a son to Abraham.
[1:59:25] a family still.
[1:59:27] &gt;&gt; So he received it from notice
[1:59:31] &gt;&gt; after Isaac
[1:59:32] &gt;&gt; who came next
[1:59:34] &gt;&gt; Jacob
[1:59:35] &gt;&gt; and Esau
[1:59:37] &gt;&gt; Jacob
[1:59:39] gave us 12 sons.
[1:59:43] &gt;&gt; And these 12 sons
[1:59:46] &gt;&gt; are the ones that went to the promised
[1:59:47] land.
[1:59:49] &gt;&gt; And how do we call them?
[1:59:52] We call them a 12 tribes
[1:59:55] &gt;&gt; of Israel.
[1:59:57] &gt;&gt; What is this?
[1:59:58] &gt;&gt; A family.
[2:00:00] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[2:00:03] &gt;&gt; This is an inheritance.
[2:00:06] &gt;&gt; They reach the promised land and the God
[2:00:09] we worship.
[2:00:11] &gt;&gt; We call him,
[2:00:13] &gt;&gt; the God of Abraham,
[2:00:15] &gt;&gt; of Isaac,
[2:00:17] &gt;&gt; and the God of Israel.
[2:00:22] Can I hear you say amen?
[2:00:24] &gt;&gt; Notice
[2:00:26] now notice
[2:00:28] &gt;&gt; Jesus our redeemer
[2:00:31] when he comes
[2:00:33] where shall he
[2:00:37] Jesus came out of from among the 12
[2:00:40] tribes of Israel.
[2:00:45] &gt;&gt; God wanted to kill the world
[2:00:48] &gt;&gt; in the days of Noah.
[2:00:50] Noah preached the word
[2:00:52] for 120 years.
[2:00:56] &gt;&gt; But how many were saved?
[2:00:58] &gt;&gt; A family.
[2:01:02] &gt;&gt; A family.
[2:01:04] &gt;&gt; That was a Noah
[2:01:06] &gt;&gt; and his three sons and their wives.
[2:01:11] &gt;&gt; Then Jesus said, "What happened in the
[2:01:14] days of Noah? Amen.
[2:01:16] &gt;&gt; So shall it to be
[2:01:18] for me
[2:01:19] &gt;&gt; a family.
[2:01:23] &gt;&gt; Are you with me still?
[2:01:26] &gt;&gt; Should we go back to the Garden of Eden?
[2:01:30] &gt;&gt; When the story of redemption started
[2:01:31] first started
[2:01:33] God planted on earth
[2:01:37] just a man
[2:01:40] &gt;&gt; and a woman,
[2:01:42] &gt;&gt; a family.
[2:01:44] And God is saying,
[2:01:46] &gt;&gt; "Be fruitful,
[2:01:48] &gt;&gt; increase in number and fill the earth."
[2:01:54] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[2:01:56] &gt;&gt; And that man was Adam and Eve.
[2:02:00] &gt;&gt; That was a family.
[2:02:03] &gt;&gt; Where was it? Seth,
[2:02:06] &gt;&gt; where did Seth got his get his wife?
[2:02:11] &gt;&gt; Out of the same family.
[2:02:13] Even Cain,
[2:02:16] &gt;&gt; where did he get his wife?
[2:02:18] &gt;&gt; In that family,
[2:02:21] &gt;&gt; where will Jesus get his bride?
[2:02:24] &gt;&gt; Within the family,
[2:02:29] &gt;&gt; where did Abraham's wife come from?
[2:02:34] &gt;&gt; Who was Sarah? Sarah.
[2:02:36] &gt;&gt; Sarah.
[2:02:39] &gt;&gt; Was a step to Abraham.
[2:02:44] It was a family
[2:02:50] &gt;&gt; as you are.
[2:02:53] &gt;&gt; You were all of you within a man.
[2:02:58] You were all hidden in a man.
[2:03:02] You were all of you in
[2:03:06] out of his ministry.
[2:03:09] It's the only one he came that he
[2:03:11] preached. He preached and you started
[2:03:14] coming. This one from this side, that
[2:03:16] one from that side. Four, five, six,
[2:03:20] seven, one step at a time in a house
[2:03:24] [screaming] in a
[2:03:27] in a tent in a tabernacle and behind
[2:03:30] this
[2:03:31] we have a ministers,
[2:03:33] &gt;&gt; preachers,
[2:03:35] &gt;&gt; preachers.
[2:03:37] You would not have known me
[2:03:40] &gt;&gt; impossible
[2:03:42] if you have known me.
[2:03:44] &gt;&gt; It's a thanks to pastor
[2:03:48] a family which is a family.
[2:03:52] &gt;&gt; Can I hear you say amen
[2:03:55] out of the same that's why Jesus said
[2:04:01] that eternal life
[2:04:04] &gt;&gt; is an inheritance.
[2:04:06] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:04:07] Let's read it.
[2:04:09] &gt;&gt; Let's read it.
[2:04:11] &gt;&gt; This inheritance
[2:04:13] and the inheritance,
[2:04:16] &gt;&gt; it takes only those of the family
[2:04:19] if you're not a part of the family.
[2:04:21] &gt;&gt; You're not going to have your
[2:04:22] everlasting life. Everlasting life.
[2:04:27] &gt;&gt; It's a family inheritance.
[2:04:33] &gt;&gt; It's a family.
[2:04:38] uh in the book of Matthew chapter 19
[2:04:41] verse
[2:04:41] &gt;&gt; let's begin with the verse 29
[2:04:46] &gt;&gt; what does the Bible tell us
[2:04:52] 29
[2:04:54] let's begin with uh 28
[2:04:57] &gt;&gt; this is what it says
[2:04:59] uh
[2:04:59] &gt;&gt; 27 rather
[2:05:02] Peter answered him
[2:05:07] We have left everything
[2:05:09] &gt;&gt; to follow you.
[2:05:12] What then will they be for us?
[2:05:15] Jesus said to them, "Truly I tell you,
[2:05:23] at the renewal of all things, when the
[2:05:25] Son of Man
[2:05:28] sits on his glorious throne,
[2:05:33] you who have followed
[2:05:44] will also sit on 12 thrones judging the
[2:05:48] 12 tribes of Israel.
[2:05:53] And everyone who has left
[2:05:58] &gt;&gt; has left the houses. For my name is
[2:06:01] &gt;&gt; his brothers
[2:06:03] &gt;&gt; or sisters.
[2:06:06] Father
[2:06:07] &gt;&gt; or why or mother?
[2:06:10] &gt;&gt; Brother
[2:06:10] &gt;&gt; sir,
[2:06:11] &gt;&gt; sister
[2:06:12] &gt;&gt; mother
[2:06:13] &gt;&gt; or mother
[2:06:14] &gt;&gt; father
[2:06:15] &gt;&gt; a father
[2:06:18] &gt;&gt; both father mother uhh sons and
[2:06:22] daughters who who are they of which
[2:06:24] family are are they of the same family?
[2:06:29] What what member are they are they from?
[2:06:34] &gt;&gt; Both of the listed father, mother, son,
[2:06:36] daughters, they are members of one
[2:06:38] family.
[2:06:42] &gt;&gt; Am I right?
[2:06:45] &gt;&gt; When we when we say father, mother,
[2:06:48] &gt;&gt; father, mother,
[2:06:50] &gt;&gt; brother,
[2:06:50] &gt;&gt; brother
[2:06:51] &gt;&gt; or sister, sister,
[2:06:54] &gt;&gt; all the above.
[2:06:56] &gt;&gt; Who are they? Is it the government? No,
[2:06:59] &gt;&gt; no.
[2:07:00] &gt;&gt; But who are they?
[2:07:02] &gt;&gt; What is it?
[2:07:03] &gt;&gt; This is a family.
[2:07:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:10] &gt;&gt; Now listen.
[2:07:12] &gt;&gt; He says
[2:07:14] &gt;&gt; and his land
[2:07:17] &gt;&gt; and his houses
[2:07:20] shall receive a hundfold
[2:07:25] &gt;&gt; and shall inherit everlasting life.
[2:07:29] So eternal life
[2:07:32] is an inheritance
[2:07:36] belongs to a family.
[2:07:39] &gt;&gt; That is why
[2:07:42] it was Abraham who first received it.
[2:07:47] All Abraham's children they received it.
[2:07:52] Even Jesus Christ,
[2:07:55] &gt;&gt; he is the son of Abraham.
[2:07:59] &gt;&gt; Brother say
[2:08:02] he's got the four titles of the son.
[2:08:07] We call him son of Abraham
[2:08:12] as
[2:08:15] an heir to Palestine.
[2:08:20] &gt;&gt; Son of David,
[2:08:24] as an heir to the royal concession,
[2:08:29] &gt;&gt; son of man.
[2:08:32] He's an heir to the earth.
[2:08:37] Did did you know that Jesus is an heir?
[2:08:44] &gt;&gt; Did you know that we are joint hairs
[2:08:47] with Jesus?
[2:08:51] It's a family.
[2:08:54] Jesus is our elder brother or older
[2:08:56] brother.
[2:08:57] &gt;&gt; That is why he is our Abraham
[2:09:02] &gt;&gt; and we are Sarah's
[2:09:04] &gt;&gt; and Jesus
[2:09:06] takes us in marriage
[2:09:09] &gt;&gt; like as or his sister
[2:09:12] &gt;&gt; that's why Abraham
[2:09:16] &gt;&gt; could never rejected Sarah
[2:09:19] &gt;&gt; even though she could not give her birth
[2:09:22] no
[2:09:22] &gt;&gt; no no because
[2:09:25] &gt;&gt; because in one hand
[2:09:28] &gt;&gt; she stands for his wife
[2:09:30] &gt;&gt; on another hand
[2:09:32] &gt;&gt; she is a step sister
[2:09:34] &gt;&gt; a little sister
[2:09:37] so rejecting her so she may go. But
[2:09:41] where
[2:09:43] &gt;&gt; should Sarah leave Abraham's house?
[2:09:46] &gt;&gt; Where was she to go?
[2:09:49] &gt;&gt; In the house of their father
[2:09:53] and when the father calls Abraham come
[2:09:56] over here.
[2:09:58] I am going to sort out your matter yours
[2:10:00] is
[2:10:01] and this matter shall be dealt with in a
[2:10:03] family within a family.
[2:10:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:10] &gt;&gt; That is why
[2:10:12] this is very important.
[2:10:16] It's a very important to understand the
[2:10:18] church of the new
[2:10:20] everything that I have shown you of the
[2:10:22] old testament the old testament
[2:10:27] &gt;&gt; is but the shadow of the new testament
[2:10:31] &gt;&gt; and the new testament
[2:10:36] is a shadow of the message of the end
[2:10:38] time.
[2:10:41] That is why
[2:10:44] you shall see that in the New Testament.
[2:10:47] &gt;&gt; Salvation
[2:10:49] is a matter of a family.
[2:10:52] &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit
[2:10:55] &gt;&gt; is a family matter.
[2:10:59] &gt;&gt; Redemption
[2:11:01] and salvation.
[2:11:04] Redemption is for salvation.
[2:11:06] &gt;&gt; That's why God
[2:11:09] sent Moses
[2:11:12] Moses is a major prophet.
[2:11:19] &gt;&gt; But the person that God gives as a
[2:11:21] mouthpiece to Moses
[2:11:25] &gt;&gt; is the older brother to Moses.
[2:11:29] &gt;&gt; He is a priest.
[2:11:34] &gt;&gt; So if you there you would be like, "Wow,
[2:11:36] what's
[2:11:38] going on?"
[2:11:40] This one is the bigger brother, the one
[2:11:42] at the le.
[2:11:44] But how
[2:11:46] that was the family there?
[2:11:48] &gt;&gt; That was the shadow
[2:11:50] &gt;&gt; to show that
[2:11:52] &gt;&gt; Moses
[2:11:54] that represented Jesus
[2:11:57] in the New Testament.
[2:12:00] &gt;&gt; He utilized his apostles
[2:12:04] which were but his brothers.
[2:12:07] Jesus said,
[2:12:10] "I am no longer calling you brothers."
[2:12:13] &gt;&gt; Because they were brothers.
[2:12:16] &gt;&gt; They were the children of Israel.
[2:12:19] &gt;&gt; Jesus spoke.
[2:12:22] &gt;&gt; Apostles spoke
[2:12:24] in the state or in the place of Jesus.
[2:12:28] That's why it says
[2:12:30] the book of Matthew.
[2:12:34] &gt;&gt; Does this book belong to Matthew? No,
[2:12:37] no.
[2:12:39] &gt;&gt; These are the words of Jesus
[2:12:42] that Matthew utilized and he wrote them
[2:12:44] down.
[2:12:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:49] &gt;&gt; John the Baptist
[2:12:51] &gt;&gt; and Jesus.
[2:12:52] &gt;&gt; They were cousins.
[2:12:58] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[2:13:00] So
[2:13:04] I would like to show you that
[2:13:07] As a church,
[2:13:10] &gt;&gt; you stand for a family.
[2:13:15] &gt;&gt; And as a family,
[2:13:19] &gt;&gt; as a family,
[2:13:22] &gt;&gt; there's one thing you need to know. And
[2:13:24] that is
[2:13:25] &gt;&gt; that in a family
[2:13:33] &gt;&gt; things might happen.
[2:13:36] in a family.
[2:13:43] &gt;&gt; Things such as a sickness,
[2:13:47] &gt;&gt; such as a sickness,
[2:13:52] &gt;&gt; and it might also happen that within the
[2:13:55] family,
[2:13:58] you you you could have a a child within
[2:14:01] the family.
[2:14:07] which is born deaf and could not hear.
[2:14:14] &gt;&gt; Are you going to cast out that child?
[2:14:20] &gt;&gt; What? What would you do?
[2:14:24] You will work as hard as possible in
[2:14:27] order to for the child to retrieve the
[2:14:30] hearing site.
[2:14:34] It might also happen that within the
[2:14:36] family
[2:14:39] a child goes crazy
[2:14:44] &gt;&gt; but despite that
[2:14:47] &gt;&gt; he's still of the family
[2:14:52] &gt;&gt; and that child despite the fact that
[2:14:55] he's gone wild he's he's got a right to
[2:14:58] a claim to the inheritance.
[2:15:02] Are you with me?
[2:15:04] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[2:15:06] &gt;&gt; Now listen.
[2:15:08] &gt;&gt; Within a family,
[2:15:12] &gt;&gt; there are some things that that are or
[2:15:15] they stand for the characteristics of
[2:15:16] that particular family.
[2:15:20] As a family,
[2:15:22] &gt;&gt; a church,
[2:15:25] &gt;&gt; you have your own characteristics.
[2:15:29] &gt;&gt; When somebody comes
[2:15:32] He looks at the brother
[2:15:34] remember.
[2:15:36] &gt;&gt; Are you from? Oh yes I am.
[2:15:42] &gt;&gt; Oh no. I could see I could tell.
[2:15:47] &gt;&gt; This is some characters of the family.
[2:15:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:52] But in a family
[2:15:56] for a family to stand for a long time
[2:16:04] within a family each know their position
[2:16:08] where they stand.
[2:16:12] &gt;&gt; This is very important.
[2:16:16] &gt;&gt; In a message they're taking sides with
[2:16:18] Jesus.
[2:16:23] preached on the 1st of June 1962
[2:16:31] &gt;&gt; quotation 95am
[2:16:35] says this
[2:16:37] &gt;&gt; he says I am going to tell you something
[2:16:40] &gt;&gt; I'm going to tell you one thing at the
[2:16:44] &gt;&gt; at the Brham Brham's family
[2:16:48] &gt;&gt; we are nine
[2:16:52] Are you with me?
[2:16:54] &gt;&gt; There were nine in number.
[2:17:00] &gt;&gt; We are ninear
[2:17:03] &gt;&gt; and we would fight
[2:17:09] like the pet dogs.
[2:17:12] Pet dogs.
[2:17:15] &gt;&gt; Now notice like a little dogs we fight.
[2:17:20] When were they fighting?
[2:17:23] &gt;&gt; When they were still small,
[2:17:27] &gt;&gt; they were like a pet dogs.
[2:17:30] &gt;&gt; They were like small dogs. When you
[2:17:32] throw a piece of bread, a slice of
[2:17:34] bread, now they come. This one grabs
[2:17:37] that one grapes.
[2:17:38] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:17:41] This is a particular character
[2:17:44] &gt;&gt; of
[2:17:48] the family when children are still
[2:17:51] small.
[2:17:56] &gt;&gt; Can I hear you say amen to this?
[2:18:00] It means so when we child
[2:18:03] I remember when we were still young
[2:18:07] we could be on the table
[2:18:09] mom would come
[2:18:11] &gt;&gt; and then she puts bread slices of bread
[2:18:15] &gt;&gt; the same bread
[2:18:17] she places on the plate
[2:18:19] &gt;&gt; and places it there
[2:18:22] and he gives us a cup of tea all of that
[2:18:26] &gt;&gt; I've got a little brother
[2:18:29] just to tease him.
[2:18:32] &gt;&gt; I would take the bread
[2:18:34] &gt;&gt; which is the same bread.
[2:18:36] &gt;&gt; I would take it and say
[2:18:40] my bread is thicker than yours
[2:18:44] and he he cries, "Oh no,
[2:18:48] but how [screaming]
[2:18:49] how is it that man a bigger part than
[2:18:53] mine
[2:18:54] &gt;&gt; and I will keep on teasing you? This is
[2:18:57] a this is a bigger than yours and this
[2:19:00] is so sweet so tasty.
[2:19:03] So he would go crying and as he cries oh
[2:19:07] I felt comfortable
[2:19:10] because he was small he understood
[2:19:13] nothing
[2:19:14] but as mom would come
[2:19:17] mom would look at me you what's going on
[2:19:18] with you why are you disturbing your
[2:19:20] brother just leave him at ease
[2:19:23] &gt;&gt; and she looks at the other one why you
[2:19:26] crying
[2:19:27] &gt;&gt; it's the same bra can't you
[2:19:32] &gt;&gt; [cheering]
[2:19:35] &gt;&gt; character.
[2:19:36] &gt;&gt; This is a character
[2:19:39] &gt;&gt; of a children, small children.
[2:19:43] &gt;&gt; And you as you are not a church of a
[2:19:47] children,
[2:19:50] &gt;&gt; you are a church,
[2:19:52] &gt;&gt; a grown up church.
[2:19:58] many years in service.
[2:20:02] So it's a time now for you to show
[2:20:07] that you are adults. You are grown now.
[2:20:15] Are you with me?
[2:20:17] &gt;&gt; Adults.
[2:20:19] &gt;&gt; You are adult.
[2:20:22] &gt;&gt; It should not be a church where people
[2:20:24] are fasting for nothing.
[2:20:27] &gt;&gt; [cheering]
[2:20:29] &gt;&gt; Oh no this. Oh no that. Oh no this. No,
[2:20:35] [cheering]
[2:20:37] &gt;&gt; the owner of the church.
[2:20:40] &gt;&gt; He is the Lord Jesus Christ.
[2:20:44] &gt;&gt; Him. Jesus.
[2:20:46] Him. Jesus.
[2:20:49] &gt;&gt; Sent. He's the one that sent
[2:20:52] [cheering]
[2:20:52] Jesus.
[2:20:54] &gt;&gt; Sent God.
[2:20:59] How many here believe that Jesus is he
[2:21:02] that sent?
[2:21:06] &gt;&gt; Please show up.
[2:21:11] &gt;&gt; Please raise up your hands if you
[2:21:13] believe that Jesus sent.
[2:21:16] [cheering]
[2:21:26] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[2:21:32] &gt;&gt; Now listen to this one
[2:21:35] &gt;&gt; in the message possessing all things
[2:21:43] &gt;&gt; and this is what I'm going to read
[2:21:46] &gt;&gt; quotation 39
[2:21:50] for me
[2:21:51] &gt;&gt; within a family
[2:21:55] We must know the place of each and every
[2:21:58] person
[2:22:01] &gt;&gt; and this is to avoid problems.
[2:22:04] &gt;&gt; Now listen,
[2:22:09] &gt;&gt; we could begin here right here.
[2:22:11] Quotation 39.
[2:22:14] &gt;&gt; I believe that
[2:22:18] I believe that when a God calls a man to
[2:22:22] a service
[2:22:24] Are we not getting projected
[2:22:27] &gt;&gt; possessing all things?
[2:22:30] &gt;&gt; Preached on the 6th of May 1962.
[2:22:35] &gt;&gt; Are you there?
[2:22:37] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[2:22:43] Yeah.
[2:22:53] I believe that when a God calls a man to
[2:22:55] service,
[2:22:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:23:01] &gt;&gt; if he's a married man
[2:23:07] &gt;&gt; and has a hotmate,
[2:23:13] &gt;&gt; he calls his wife with him.
[2:23:17] Amen.
[2:23:22] &gt;&gt; No, I I expected a great amen.
[2:23:27] &gt;&gt; No, your amen did not convince me.
[2:23:31] &gt;&gt; Please throw an amen, a huge amen to
[2:23:33] this.
[2:23:37] This is what says
[2:23:41] in order for a man
[2:23:45] &gt;&gt; to do great achievement,
[2:23:51] &gt;&gt; he must have behind him
[2:23:56] a sustaining wife, a wife that supports
[2:23:59] him.
[2:24:03] &gt;&gt; Otherwise, he will never achieve. He he
[2:24:05] will achieve nothing.
[2:24:08] &gt;&gt; I am married.
[2:24:10] &gt;&gt; My wife is over there.
[2:24:15] &gt;&gt; If she makes me feel uncomfortable
[2:24:20] and she's always causing trouble,
[2:24:22] disturbing me all the time.
[2:24:25] You would see me here behind the pulpit
[2:24:29] but in a bad mood.
[2:24:34] &gt;&gt; An angry man.
[2:24:36] &gt;&gt; That is why
[2:24:39] when you see a great man of God,
[2:24:44] &gt;&gt; respect his wife as well.
[2:24:49] &gt;&gt; This is a very important.
[2:24:54] These are not my words and my
[2:24:56] statements.
[2:24:58] Brother Brandham says so.
[2:25:01] Now listen, he says
[2:25:04] if he's a a married man and has a
[2:25:08] helpmate,
[2:25:11] he calls his wife with him
[2:25:14] because
[2:25:16] they
[2:25:19] how are they
[2:25:21] over there?
[2:25:23] that two are one.
[2:25:26] They are one.
[2:25:30] That is why my beloved brothers and
[2:25:31] sisters,
[2:25:34] &gt;&gt; this is the character of the family.
[2:25:39] If it's in a family
[2:25:43] or always a father and mother fighting
[2:25:45] all the time,
[2:25:48] &gt;&gt; that family will be divided.
[2:25:53] Half of the children will stay with the
[2:25:55] father, stick with the father.
[2:25:58] Others they will stick with the mother.
[2:26:00] &gt;&gt; That is why
[2:26:03] you've you you are you you are left as a
[2:26:06] family.
[2:26:10] In a in a way it shows in a way that the
[2:26:14] man that you respected
[2:26:16] respect
[2:26:17] &gt;&gt; the same way you respected him respect
[2:26:19] his wife as well.
[2:26:21] respect her in the same manner. This is
[2:26:24] very important.
[2:26:27] &gt;&gt; And in a family,
[2:26:29] &gt;&gt; a father
[2:26:31] &gt;&gt; has his co-workers,
[2:26:36] &gt;&gt; a father's friends,
[2:26:39] colleagues
[2:26:41] and amongst the children.
[2:26:45] &gt;&gt; It might happen that a father trust one
[2:26:48] child.
[2:26:51] It doesn't mean that he hates others,
[2:26:54] &gt;&gt; but
[2:26:55] he trusts
[2:26:57] one child
[2:26:59] &gt;&gt; because he knows
[2:27:01] &gt;&gt; that this child
[2:27:02] &gt;&gt; is smart.
[2:27:05] &gt;&gt; This one,
[2:27:07] &gt;&gt; he's got maturity.
[2:27:11] Mother on the other side,
[2:27:15] &gt;&gt; she [snorts] is obligated or duty bound
[2:27:18] to respect that child.
[2:27:21] &gt;&gt; Mama, the mother
[2:27:24] &gt;&gt; must also respect
[2:27:28] the father's co-workers
[2:27:32] &gt;&gt; because these are but collaborators.
[2:27:38] &gt;&gt; Are you still with me?
[2:27:41] So the mother
[2:27:43] &gt;&gt; master respect them
[2:27:45] &gt;&gt; you too
[2:27:47] &gt;&gt; respect the mother
[2:27:49] &gt;&gt; and the brother says
[2:27:51] &gt;&gt; if you claim to love me
[2:27:55] &gt;&gt; love my family [applause]
[2:27:58] &gt;&gt; love my family
[2:28:02] if I happen to love pastor
[2:28:05] &gt;&gt; the same love I projected
[2:28:08] Because you are pastor Kodima's a family
[2:28:13] &gt;&gt; the children
[2:28:15] pastor's children
[2:28:17] &gt;&gt; he biological children they must know
[2:28:23] as a family
[2:28:33] do you say amen to this
[2:28:36] so you shall see
[2:28:38] This is my advice.
[2:28:42] &gt;&gt; Remember I said in the beginning, it's
[2:28:44] an advice.
[2:28:48] &gt;&gt; Every time I give you an advice,
[2:28:52] &gt;&gt; it's up to you
[2:28:55] &gt;&gt; to take it or to reject it.
[2:28:59] &gt;&gt; Should you reject it?
[2:29:02] &gt;&gt; Keep this in mind. There's a
[2:29:03] consequences,
[2:29:05] &gt;&gt; but should you get them, consequence.
[2:29:07] &gt;&gt; There's also consequences
[2:29:12] &gt;&gt; as a family
[2:29:16] be mature children
[2:29:20] that have grown up.
[2:29:22] &gt;&gt; Now listen,
[2:29:26] we used to fight.
[2:29:29] Please get that quotation.
[2:29:31] &gt;&gt; We used to fight
[2:29:34] by taking sight like a pet dog.
[2:29:39] But after all,
[2:29:42] &gt;&gt; please get the quotation with Jesus. But
[2:29:44] after all,
[2:29:48] &gt;&gt; once the fight is over,
[2:29:54] we remained br still.
[2:30:01] &gt;&gt; We were still br
[2:30:06] Now listen.
[2:30:11] &gt;&gt; One knew that the other one was Abraham
[2:30:16] here
[2:30:17] &gt;&gt; as a family.
[2:30:19] &gt;&gt; All of you.
[2:30:21] &gt;&gt; Your master recognize each other.
[2:30:25] You recognize this one is my brother.
[2:30:33] She is my sister.
[2:30:37] &gt;&gt; If he is your brother
[2:30:41] &gt;&gt; and that she is your sister,
[2:30:44] &gt;&gt; so why would you criticize them
[2:30:48] in your natural family? Can you do that?
[2:30:53] &gt;&gt; My my own father.
[2:30:56] &gt;&gt; He may be a drunkard.
[2:31:00] a heavy drinker. He comes home drunk,
[2:31:04] &gt;&gt; but he's still my father.
[2:31:08] &gt;&gt; He's my father.
[2:31:11] &gt;&gt; I will never allow anyone
[2:31:15] &gt;&gt; to play around with my father.
[2:31:18] &gt;&gt; I will never accept that. [cheering]
[2:31:23] &gt;&gt; My brother,
[2:31:26] &gt;&gt; he might be crazy.
[2:31:30] And he's that the crazy one, the
[2:31:32] crippled one. He doesn't speak. He's at
[2:31:34] home,
[2:31:35] &gt;&gt; but he's still my brother.
[2:31:38] &gt;&gt; He is my brother.
[2:31:40] &gt;&gt; I pray for him.
[2:31:44] &gt;&gt; Now listen to brother Brham.
[2:31:48] &gt;&gt; And I knew there were broms.
[2:31:53] Uh he knowed was a brom. See
[2:31:59] But we will fight
[2:32:03] &gt;&gt; you too in your own family.
[2:32:06] &gt;&gt; There's some uh useless fight, some
[2:32:10] fussing.
[2:32:12] That's the reason why I spoke of
[2:32:15] why
[2:32:18] despite the fights,
[2:32:21] but I will never take out the knife
[2:32:25] to kill my own brother. No,
[2:32:28] this
[2:32:30] &gt;&gt; I become like a Kane of all
[2:32:33] &gt;&gt; and as soon as I become like Kane,
[2:32:36] &gt;&gt; it shows plainly
[2:32:38] &gt;&gt; that a Cain
[2:32:40] &gt;&gt; and Abel,
[2:32:43] it shows that both Cain and Abel did not
[2:32:45] have the same father.
[2:32:50] &gt;&gt; They did not have the same father.
[2:32:53] That is why
[2:32:55] Cain's father
[2:32:58] is the serpent,
[2:33:00] &gt;&gt; the devil.
[2:33:02] &gt;&gt; That is why
[2:33:04] &gt;&gt; he killed his brother.
[2:33:07] &gt;&gt; He You can't kill your own brother.
[2:33:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:33:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:33:15] &gt;&gt; In a family,
[2:33:17] &gt;&gt; problems will always be there.
[2:33:22] Show me here a person who's got a family
[2:33:26] &gt;&gt; and that they never had problems in that
[2:33:28] family anyone like
[2:33:30] &gt;&gt; it does not exist. That family does not
[2:33:32] exist
[2:33:33] &gt;&gt; but we bear with each other.
[2:33:37] &gt;&gt; We love each other
[2:33:42] &gt;&gt; and we support each other.
[2:33:48] If your brother is a crippled man,
[2:33:55] he can hardly walk
[2:33:59] &gt;&gt; and that you see your that your brother
[2:34:01] is on the stage
[2:34:03] &gt;&gt; to move from up there over here.
[2:34:07] He can hardly make it. What will you
[2:34:10] say?
[2:34:13] Will you say try your utmost and come
[2:34:16] down?
[2:34:18] &gt;&gt; Will you say that?
[2:34:21] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[2:34:21] &gt;&gt; What are you going to say?
[2:34:24] &gt;&gt; You you started climbing backward
[2:34:26] &gt;&gt; backward
[2:34:28] &gt;&gt; backward
[2:34:29] &gt;&gt; backward
[2:34:31] &gt;&gt; backward.
[2:34:33] I said brother let me piggy back you.
[2:34:36] He comes up
[2:34:38] &gt;&gt; then I carries him. I carry him
[2:34:42] one step at a time with my brother.
[2:34:45] &gt;&gt; One step at a time. One step at a time.
[2:34:51] &gt;&gt; One step at a time. Slow
[2:34:54] &gt;&gt; until I drop him down.
[2:34:59] Can I climb up there
[2:35:02] and I piggy back him?
[2:35:05] The minute I piggy back him, I say you.
[2:35:09] You remember the other day you say the
[2:35:11] nonsense to me. You will see I'm going
[2:35:13] to No,
[2:35:16] &gt;&gt; will I be able to do that?
[2:35:19] &gt;&gt; I cannot do it.
[2:35:21] &gt;&gt; But why would it be that?
[2:35:24] &gt;&gt; You are able to do it.
[2:35:27] You are a family.
[2:35:29] &gt;&gt; You are a family.
[2:35:31] &gt;&gt; In a family.
[2:35:35] &gt;&gt; In a family.
[2:35:37] Some people
[2:35:39] &gt;&gt; they are talkative
[2:35:43] &gt;&gt; whenever you you around them they
[2:35:44] they're talkative they talk
[2:35:48] should they be talkative but of the word
[2:35:52] even though they are talkative
[2:35:57] as long as they are talkative in the
[2:35:59] word speaking of the word let leave them
[2:36:01] alone
[2:36:03] &gt;&gt; this is what they have as character
[2:36:08] Some they are the quiet tribe.
[2:36:11] There is an issue in the church. He's
[2:36:13] there. He says nothing.
[2:36:15] &gt;&gt; He says nothing. You ask a question.
[2:36:20] What is your opinion on this issue? You
[2:36:22] have nothing to say. That is his
[2:36:24] character.
[2:36:26] No. Why is it that you are always the
[2:36:27] quiet one? You're always like this. No.
[2:36:31] No. It doesn't mean everybody will speak
[2:36:33] in the same manner.
[2:36:36] All around the throne
[2:36:38] &gt;&gt; around the throne
[2:36:40] &gt;&gt; around the throne of Jesus Christ we see
[2:36:43] four creatures
[2:36:46] four creatures
[2:36:48] there was the first one the spirit of an
[2:36:50] ox which stand for sacrifice
[2:36:55] he may be criticized he may be even
[2:36:58] spoken out for but he says nothing
[2:37:00] is there
[2:37:03] you move from
[2:37:06] You find a man
[2:37:08] first. Let's let's begin with the lion.
[2:37:11] &gt;&gt; The lion
[2:37:13] is that the angry man, somebody
[2:37:16] [laughter]
[2:37:16] he speaks, he shouts, he screams, he
[2:37:18] speaks.
[2:37:20] When somebody comes in the family
[2:37:23] to create some troubles in the family.
[2:37:27] A person like that, you're not going to
[2:37:29] get a lamb to fight against him. No.
[2:37:31] &gt;&gt; No.
[2:37:33] Since there's a troublemaker in the
[2:37:34] family, you came to the family, we're
[2:37:37] going to call the lion of the family.
[2:37:40] And when the lion comes, you
[2:37:45] he will scream that big voice.
[2:37:48] That is his character.
[2:37:51] But when amongst the children
[2:37:54] there's another one that goes high,
[2:37:58] we call a lamb.
[2:38:02] to come. My brother, why are you
[2:38:05] screaming so loud? Please come down.
[2:38:09] Please come down.
[2:38:12] Whole job is why are you always that is
[2:38:14] his nature as a lamb.
[2:38:17] &gt;&gt; And after the lamb and the lion, we've
[2:38:20] got a man.
[2:38:22] &gt;&gt; A manigence
[2:38:24] stands for intelligence,
[2:38:28] &gt;&gt; wisdom,
[2:38:31] Say this one
[2:38:34] &gt;&gt; when a father looks he say this child
[2:38:38] &gt;&gt; is very smart
[2:38:41] &gt;&gt; father would want to go out
[2:38:43] &gt;&gt; say come over here I'm going to the bank
[2:38:47] can you escort me
[2:38:51] I am fixing to purchase this one today
[2:38:54] please escort me
[2:38:57] please just write
[2:39:00] because he's a very smart even at
[2:39:02] school. He says, "Okay, can you write it
[2:39:06] down?
[2:39:08] &gt;&gt; Don't be jealous.
[2:39:11] &gt;&gt; Don't you ever be jealous."
[2:39:14] &gt;&gt; Oh no, father.
[2:39:17] Why is it that always him only him?
[2:39:21] &gt;&gt; When the father goes,
[2:39:23] the father goes a day with him. The
[2:39:25] father goes that day with him.
[2:39:29] No, bear with them in that.
[2:39:34] &gt;&gt; Can I hear you say amen to that?
[2:39:39] &gt;&gt; Uh, what is your name?
[2:39:41] &gt;&gt; Samuel.
[2:39:41] &gt;&gt; Samuel. Samuel.
[2:39:45] &gt;&gt; Why always Samuel?
[2:39:47] &gt;&gt; The other one.
[2:39:48] &gt;&gt; My name is Paul. My name is Paul.
[2:39:53] &gt;&gt; Why only him?
[2:39:55] &gt;&gt; Why only the other one?
[2:39:58] They are family members.
[2:40:03] &gt;&gt; They are family members.
[2:40:05] &gt;&gt; He is an an older brother, a bigger
[2:40:08] brother.
[2:40:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:40:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:40:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:40:13] &gt;&gt; Why only brother? He is of the family.
[2:40:21] Why only son?
[2:40:24] &gt;&gt; Especially that one over there.
[2:40:30] &gt;&gt; But who was the Solomon of old?
[2:40:33] &gt;&gt; Was he not David's own son?
[2:40:38] &gt;&gt; Was he not David's son?
[2:40:42] &gt;&gt; So we must keep in mind that we are a
[2:40:45] family.
[2:40:51] I may not be able to finish off all the
[2:40:55] four points that I mentioned,
[2:40:57] &gt;&gt; but this is very important. Listen,
[2:41:02] I I know I they knew that I was a
[2:41:04] Braham. You see,
[2:41:10] &gt;&gt; but still we couldn't fight.
[2:41:15] You two in your family, you also do the
[2:41:17] same.
[2:41:20] &gt;&gt; But they are your brothers still.
[2:41:24] &gt;&gt; They are your brothers.
[2:41:26] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[2:41:29] &gt;&gt; That's the way it is. We might have some
[2:41:31] uh we might we might different.
[2:41:35] &gt;&gt; We might different
[2:41:37] between us.
[2:41:40] &gt;&gt; That's all right.
[2:41:41] &gt;&gt; Correct.
[2:41:42] &gt;&gt; That's all right.
[2:41:45] that there's an issue comes up
[2:41:48] &gt;&gt; and a brother stands up and say I'm not
[2:41:50] I'm against this
[2:41:54] don't go don't go and gossip why did he
[2:41:56] say he's not against is against this
[2:42:00] normal
[2:42:00] &gt;&gt; no this is a normal as a family
[2:42:07] &gt;&gt; see that's right
[2:42:10] &gt;&gt; normal
[2:42:10] &gt;&gt; here it says it's in the French
[2:42:13] translation says said that's all right.
[2:42:15] Which is the same translation as over
[2:42:16] there. That's all right.
[2:42:19] &gt;&gt; This is in order.
[2:42:23] &gt;&gt; We are one.
[2:42:26] &gt;&gt; We one in Christ.
[2:42:30] &gt;&gt; We believe this message.
[2:42:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:42:34] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:42:38] &gt;&gt; Now notice
[2:42:42] &gt;&gt; as Brhams grew up
[2:42:46] &gt;&gt; and that they left the stage of a
[2:42:48] childhood,
[2:42:52] &gt;&gt; they would not come together as pets
[2:42:55] dogs fighting as they did when they were
[2:42:58] small.
[2:43:00] &gt;&gt; They would come like adult. They will
[2:43:03] show up like adult.
[2:43:06] This one comes driving.
[2:43:10] &gt;&gt; This one comes on the bike.
[2:43:13] &gt;&gt; Another one comes walking with his wife.
[2:43:18] &gt;&gt; The other one comes from this direction.
[2:43:21] Here they come. They sit
[2:43:26] and table a family meeting.
[2:43:34] says in a message why Christ speak
[2:43:39] &gt;&gt; preached on the 14th of July 1963
[2:43:44] 14th of July 1963
[2:43:47] quotation seven
[2:43:53] now about a little family meeting today
[2:44:01] I happened to meet my brothers at home.
[2:44:06] &gt;&gt; At my sister's house.
[2:44:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:44:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:44:11] &gt;&gt; Where were they having a meeting?
[2:44:16] &gt;&gt; In a house of his little sister
[2:44:22] as the first born of the family.
[2:44:26] And in a family
[2:44:29] complex we need to avoid having some
[2:44:31] behaviors that are complex behaviors
[2:44:35] only.
[2:44:36] &gt;&gt; You know I am
[2:44:39] look at brother
[2:44:42] as the older brother
[2:44:46] he accept that the family meeting
[2:44:50] &gt;&gt; should happen in the house of his little
[2:44:52] sister.
[2:44:55] He could have said, "You are a woman. I
[2:44:59] am the man of the family. You know,
[2:45:01] everyone, I want to see you at my
[2:45:02] house." But here, brother,
[2:45:06] &gt;&gt; in the house of my little sister
[2:45:10] and certain of our parents
[2:45:14] that are living in the neighborhood,
[2:45:20] &gt;&gt; the big team of Branhams
[2:45:26] This is the big team of mood.
[2:45:33] &gt;&gt; Others are coming from different places
[2:45:35] from provinces from rural areas. They
[2:45:38] coming together. They coming together as
[2:45:41] unity not in order to fight.
[2:45:45] &gt;&gt; Fighting is when we were small.
[2:45:48] &gt;&gt; But right now
[2:45:50] we are adults.
[2:45:53] We sit. We sit
[2:45:56] then. How do you do? Oh, how is
[2:45:59] everything going on at at your house?
[2:46:02] &gt;&gt; So happy to see you. How do you do?
[2:46:05] &gt;&gt; I'm so very well. Ah, he gracious one.
[2:46:09] How are you doing? How is everyone over?
[2:46:11] How's your son?
[2:46:13] &gt;&gt; And how's that one over there?
[2:46:15] &gt;&gt; I haven't seen him in a while.
[2:46:18] He greets this one. He greets his young
[2:46:22] despite the fact he's young. I might
[2:46:25] since he's young. I might give that one
[2:46:28] and shake. How are you?
[2:46:31] You see
[2:46:33] &gt;&gt; and over here ah this is the elder.
[2:46:38] &gt;&gt; This is the dean.
[2:46:40] &gt;&gt; And when I come close Oh my
[2:46:43] [screaming and groaning] dear elder.
[2:46:46] &gt;&gt; This is a this is an elder. It's a
[2:46:48] family.
[2:46:51] &gt;&gt; When we come together, it's not in order
[2:46:52] to fight
[2:46:54] &gt;&gt; because we are now adults.
[2:46:59] &gt;&gt; Melody has a grown up.
[2:47:02] [cheering and applause]
[2:47:06] &gt;&gt; This is how you should walk.
[2:47:11] He says
[2:47:14] &gt;&gt; the bigger team of Brham
[2:47:21] &gt;&gt; should they all come to Kentucky here
[2:47:25] if all of the family
[2:47:29] I believe that we would have to to hire
[2:47:32] the entire city
[2:47:36] are many
[2:47:40] He speak about the biological family. He
[2:47:43] says there were many
[2:47:46] and this day
[2:47:49] &gt;&gt; it's not a little family.
[2:47:52] &gt;&gt; It's a great family, big family.
[2:47:58] Amen.
[2:47:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:48:01] &gt;&gt; That we would have to hide the entire
[2:48:04] city.
[2:48:06] There are many but
[2:48:11] This is only a little coming back home.
[2:48:15] So
[2:48:17] those that were married,
[2:48:20] those that had left,
[2:48:24] those that went to other provinces, they
[2:48:25] relocated, doctors,
[2:48:28] nurses, everyone. Should they come
[2:48:30] together? Everyone.
[2:48:33] And let me ask a question.
[2:48:35] As the Brandhams come back,
[2:48:38] &gt;&gt; as they come back, what do they do?
[2:48:42] As they come together, they display
[2:48:45] unity.
[2:48:46] &gt;&gt; That's
[2:48:48] showing that
[2:48:52] despite the fact that we are no longer
[2:48:54] living in the same house,
[2:48:56] &gt;&gt; but still we won.
[2:49:00] We won still.
[2:49:02] We will always be back home. He says,
[2:49:05] &gt;&gt; he says
[2:49:07] a little back home.
[2:49:10] &gt;&gt; Now listen to this part here.
[2:49:18] &gt;&gt; Often times we would meet at my father's
[2:49:21] mother's house.
[2:49:26] Okay.
[2:49:29] We used to all meet at mama's house.
[2:49:42] And she was the old type
[2:49:49] that held us together kind of.
[2:49:55] Who was the mother or what was she?
[2:49:58] &gt;&gt; She was a typost.
[2:50:01] &gt;&gt; It means
[2:50:03] every single one
[2:50:06] would come around
[2:50:10] around her. Amen.
[2:50:13] &gt;&gt; And he says
[2:50:16] something.
[2:50:19] &gt;&gt; She was
[2:50:21] she held us together kind of.
[2:50:27] But the God had taken the typost to
[2:50:29] heaven.
[2:50:33] The type that God taken to heaven
[2:50:41] is typost.
[2:50:44] &gt;&gt; Who is the typost?
[2:50:50] Who is he that assembled everyone?
[2:50:56] &gt;&gt; Who was the head of this church?
[2:51:01] that is being now taken to heaven.
[2:51:07] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[2:51:09] &gt;&gt; The tie post
[2:51:12] is a pastor.
[2:51:16] He's the one on whom everyone held,
[2:51:19] everyone around him. But notice
[2:51:24] when a mother was taken to heaven
[2:51:29] where were Brandhams divided or did they
[2:51:32] get divided?
[2:51:34] Notice
[2:51:38] &gt;&gt; even though the mother was taken to
[2:51:40] heaven, they all came together reunion
[2:51:46] in the house of a little h brother,
[2:51:50] brother Lo.
[2:51:55] &gt;&gt; His name just skipped my mind. A little
[2:51:57] brother to brother. They went there
[2:52:00] showing that
[2:52:03] despite the fact that mama is no longer
[2:52:06] there,
[2:52:09] &gt;&gt; but we remain a brand family
[2:52:15] and we stick together
[2:52:20] despite the fact that no longer there
[2:52:26] must remained.
[2:52:28] a family.
[2:52:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:52:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:52:38] &gt;&gt; He says
[2:52:46] and I believe that one day all of us
[2:52:48] will meet they up in heaven.
[2:52:53] &gt;&gt; But if you have to tear each artist down
[2:52:58] You are fighting one against another.
[2:53:01] You are destroying each other.
[2:53:04] &gt;&gt; I'm being honest with you this morning.
[2:53:08] Kodima is already in heaven.
[2:53:11] But if you do not show the sign of
[2:53:13] maturity,
[2:53:15] others won't see him.
[2:53:19] Some will not see him. You remain here.
[2:53:24] You remain behind the house or this
[2:53:27] househ
[2:53:28] we built it
[2:53:31] there this
[2:53:33] speaker I I purchased them
[2:53:39] we do not fight for earthly things
[2:53:47] our fight
[2:53:49] &gt;&gt; is to go to heaven
[2:53:52] &gt;&gt; don't you ever forget This
[2:53:55] &gt;&gt; don't you ever forget this advice.
[2:53:58] &gt;&gt; The adi the advice is advice.
[2:54:05] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[2:54:07] &gt;&gt; Banana says this.
[2:54:11] He has spoken in many places. But first
[2:54:15] I'll take this one.
[2:54:18] &gt;&gt; I'm singling out. I'm taking one point
[2:54:21] for the next segment.
[2:54:24] &gt;&gt; These other points you have a big
[2:54:27] picture. You can feel
[2:54:29] let's speak of unity. Oneness.
[2:54:33] &gt;&gt; Now listen to me.
[2:54:35] &gt;&gt; Unity.
[2:54:39] This is a a great venture for a family,
[2:54:47] &gt;&gt; a divided family.
[2:54:50] will perish.
[2:54:53] &gt;&gt; It will never stand.
[2:54:55] &gt;&gt; Now listen to me.
[2:54:57] &gt;&gt; This day Donald Trump,
[2:54:59] &gt;&gt; Donald the Trump
[2:55:04] is h catching the people that are coming
[2:55:07] to America
[2:55:09] &gt;&gt; to send them back home to their own
[2:55:12] country. Those that went to America.
[2:55:16] Is a Donald Trump really an American?
[2:55:22] &gt;&gt; Brother says the genuine Americans
[2:55:26] are Indians.
[2:55:31] He says, "But how did Indians forfeit
[2:55:34] their country
[2:55:38] when white people came all the way from
[2:55:40] Europe
[2:55:42] &gt;&gt; and they landed in America?
[2:55:46] Indians
[2:55:48] &gt;&gt; were first united.
[2:55:52] &gt;&gt; They had a leader
[2:55:56] &gt;&gt; by the name of Jeronimo.
[2:55:59] &gt;&gt; Jeronimo
[2:56:03] was like a a chief unto them, the king
[2:56:06] unto them.
[2:56:08] They did not have a weapon,
[2:56:09] sophisticated weapon.
[2:56:12] There were
[2:56:14] there were needy people. The people that
[2:56:16] were living according to the customs,
[2:56:18] &gt;&gt; they were living according to their
[2:56:19] customs.
[2:56:23] &gt;&gt; They survived the thanks to the skins of
[2:56:26] animals.
[2:56:28] They would kill an animal, a buffalo.
[2:56:31] They would eat the meat.
[2:56:33] They would take the fats
[2:56:36] &gt;&gt; to make clothes out of that.
[2:56:39] But a white man, what did he do?
[2:56:43] He divided Indians.
[2:56:47] &gt;&gt; And after dividing Indians,
[2:56:51] they got hold of the country
[2:56:54] up until today.
[2:56:58] &gt;&gt; Indians are in a minority, few in
[2:57:00] number.
[2:57:02] Never.
[2:57:04] When they take the country back,
[2:57:07] &gt;&gt; it's over.
[2:57:10] What d what is it that destroy the
[2:57:12] Indians?
[2:57:13] &gt;&gt; The vision
[2:57:16] &gt;&gt; the vision
[2:57:18] &gt;&gt; that's not a buildup. Now listen to me.
[2:57:22] &gt;&gt; God
[2:57:24] is the Almighty.
[2:57:28] &gt;&gt; But we see some points in the Bible
[2:57:32] &gt;&gt; whereby God becomes incap incapable or
[2:57:38] powerless. When you touch that point,
[2:57:41] God becomes powerless.
[2:57:44] And what is what are those points? What
[2:57:46] is that point?
[2:57:48] &gt;&gt; God has got weak points.
[2:57:51] to an extent that when you touch that
[2:57:53] weak point,
[2:57:54] &gt;&gt; God becomes a powerless
[2:57:56] &gt;&gt; amongst the weaknesses.
[2:58:03] &gt;&gt; God becomes so weak, powerless before
[2:58:06] his word.
[2:58:09] It is a truth that God is a powerful
[2:58:14] but when you present the word to God,
[2:58:18] &gt;&gt; God becomes weak.
[2:58:20] He will do nothing.
[2:58:23] That's what brotherham says.
[2:58:27] Brother preach the message of taking God
[2:58:29] at his own word.
[2:58:32] Should you desire something from God,
[2:58:37] present the word. Lord,
[2:58:41] this is what is written.
[2:58:43] &gt;&gt; It is written. It is written.
[2:58:46] God becomes weak.
[2:58:48] He will give your heart desire
[2:58:52] &gt;&gt; and another point
[2:58:55] &gt;&gt; which weakens the God
[2:58:58] &gt;&gt; unity. Amen.
[2:59:01] &gt;&gt; When the people are united
[2:59:04] &gt;&gt; so united welded
[2:59:07] let's read the Bible
[2:59:09] in Genesis.
[2:59:14] &gt;&gt; This is where I'm going to to finish
[2:59:15] off. I'm going to read in Genesis
[2:59:18] &gt;&gt; because my two hours have come to an
[2:59:20] end. I've got five minutes left. Listen
[2:59:23] to what
[2:59:25] &gt;&gt; Genesis chapter 11.
[2:59:28] &gt;&gt; This is what the Bible says.
[2:59:32] &gt;&gt; Verse one.
[2:59:36] Oh yes. Now the whole world had one
[2:59:39] language
[2:59:42] &gt;&gt; and a common speech.
[2:59:47] As the people moved east toward,
[2:59:52] &gt;&gt; they found a plane in a in a in a shiner
[2:59:56] &gt;&gt; and settled there.
[3:00:00] They say to each other, "Come,
[3:00:03] &gt;&gt; let's make bricks
[3:00:06] &gt;&gt; and bake them thoroughly.
[3:00:29] Uh, bear with me. I misread here. They
[3:00:31] use the brick instead of stone
[3:00:36] and tar for motor.
[3:00:39] Then they say it again, come,
[3:00:43] &gt;&gt; let us build ourselves a city
[3:00:49] with a tower that reaches to the heavens
[3:00:54] so that we may make a name,
[3:01:00] a name for ourselves, otherwise we will
[3:01:03] be scattered over the face of the whole
[3:01:06] earth.
[3:01:07] &gt;&gt; Verse five,
[3:01:10] But the Lord came down.
[3:01:16] The Lord came down to see the city and
[3:01:18] the tower the people were building.
[3:01:24] &gt;&gt; Verse six.
[3:01:28] And I want that everyone to read that
[3:01:34] &gt;&gt; as it is done in a kinder dart.
[3:01:39] um in English
[3:01:43] &gt;&gt; in read out of your own Bible verse six.
[3:01:48] &gt;&gt; Now I am your teacher
[3:01:52] &gt;&gt; that's in the crash.
[3:01:56] &gt;&gt; I'll be counting from one to three. When
[3:01:59] I get to three, you start reading.
[3:02:01] &gt;&gt; One
[3:02:03] 2 3
[3:02:07] The Lord said if there's one people
[3:02:10] speaking the same language they have
[3:02:12] begun to do this then nothing they plan
[3:02:16] to do would be impossible for them.
[3:02:25] verse seven.
[3:02:33] &gt;&gt; Understand each other.
[3:02:36] &gt;&gt; Understand each other.
[3:02:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:02:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:02:42] &gt;&gt; Now listen to God.
[3:02:45] The Lord said,
[3:02:49] &gt;&gt; the Lord said, see,
[3:02:54] &gt;&gt; see they are building, making up one
[3:02:57] people.
[3:02:59] &gt;&gt; How many peoples?
[3:03:01] &gt;&gt; One.
[3:03:06] &gt;&gt; And all have a common speech.
[3:03:14] And of that which they have undertaken
[3:03:16] to do
[3:03:20] no
[3:03:24] &gt;&gt; nothing will hinder them
[3:03:30] to do according to their plan.
[3:03:35] &gt;&gt; God the Almighty
[3:03:39] &gt;&gt; here he acknowledges he recognizes
[3:03:45] that is seeing that they are making up
[3:03:47] one people
[3:03:50] and then they speak the same language.
[3:03:55] Nothing will stop them.
[3:04:00] Nothing will stop them from achieving
[3:04:02] what they have as a plan.
[3:04:07] One less God is the Almighty.
[3:04:11] He could just blow up blow
[3:04:16] so that the tower could not reach the
[3:04:18] heaven.
[3:04:20] He could uh even send the thunders
[3:04:26] in such a way that after they had
[3:04:28] erected the tower
[3:04:31] like uh it was with the walls of
[3:04:33] Jericho,
[3:04:36] &gt;&gt; he could easily have sand to break them.
[3:04:40] But God says, but God said
[3:04:44] that which they have in mind of doing
[3:04:48] they will make it.
[3:04:50] Even if I send thunders
[3:04:53] and that the walls come the walls come
[3:04:55] tumbling down. They will rebuild the
[3:04:58] walls.
[3:05:01] I may send rain
[3:05:04] to destroy the house. But since they are
[3:05:07] still one, they will rebuild again.
[3:05:11] What I can do right now
[3:05:14] for them to fail,
[3:05:17] &gt;&gt; I have to divide them.
[3:05:20] &gt;&gt; Divide them.
[3:05:23] And how did God do it?
[3:05:27] God simply sent a language
[3:05:32] &gt;&gt; and he shared he divided languages.
[3:05:36] Now it becomes
[3:05:38] &gt;&gt; when I say good morning,
[3:05:40] &gt;&gt; the other one say,
[3:05:44] &gt;&gt; "What did you say?"
[3:05:48] &gt;&gt; You see, we hardly can hear each other.
[3:05:52] When I say to this one, "Please hand me
[3:05:55] over a brick."
[3:05:57] In English, he hears as if
[3:06:01] &gt;&gt; I said, "Hey, pull me from my foot and
[3:06:03] drop me down.
[3:06:07] So now this is a confusion.
[3:06:11] &gt;&gt; So now people would come together.
[3:06:14] &gt;&gt; He that hears this one's language they
[3:06:17] come together.
[3:06:19] &gt;&gt; Now this this is a group they understand
[3:06:21] each other well
[3:06:29] &gt;&gt; group. You see now it's become this is
[3:06:31] divided
[3:06:33] &gt;&gt; in many groups no more a way out
[3:06:38] others would say let's carry on with
[3:06:40] building
[3:06:41] &gt;&gt; others would say no stop it
[3:06:46] &gt;&gt; up until today
[3:06:49] the Babylon tower had never been
[3:06:52] completed
[3:06:55] it has it became babel
[3:07:00] And a babel means confusion.
[3:07:03] That's it.
[3:07:06] &gt;&gt; So should you get divided,
[3:07:11] &gt;&gt; you will go nowhere.
[3:07:17] &gt;&gt; Thus shall become Babylon.
[3:07:22] &gt;&gt; And what is Babylon? Confusion.
[3:07:28] this one will say no I want this one
[3:07:32] even when you will get to a point of
[3:07:34] voting for a pastor pastor
[3:07:37] a group would be like we want this one
[3:07:40] another one we want that one we want
[3:07:42] this one we want this
[3:07:46] and what shall it beus
[3:07:50] &gt;&gt; confusion
[3:07:52] that's why
[3:07:54] &gt;&gt; unity
[3:07:57] Unity
[3:07:59] &gt;&gt; is a very important.
[3:08:03] &gt;&gt; That's why brother in order to put an
[3:08:06] end to my preaching
[3:08:08] &gt;&gt; with regard to the unity
[3:08:11] provokey
[3:08:12] says unity provokes harmony. ceremony.
[3:08:19] It says in a message of oneness
[3:08:22] 1962 he says
[3:08:24] &gt;&gt; he says
[3:08:27] &gt;&gt; any man with his family
[3:08:31] &gt;&gt; quotation 15 he says
[3:08:33] correct
[3:08:34] &gt;&gt; any man and his family correct and good
[3:08:38] &gt;&gt; good
[3:08:41] &gt;&gt; obedient
[3:08:44] family is one with another
[3:08:48] is a one with another
[3:08:52] family.
[3:08:54] &gt;&gt; And if there's a
[3:08:58] &gt;&gt; And if there's something in the family
[3:09:00] that moves,
[3:09:05] &gt;&gt; then it's not right.
[3:09:10] &gt;&gt; We we should never be divided.
[3:09:13] &gt;&gt; The family is broken somewhere.
[3:09:17] somewhere
[3:09:20] &gt;&gt; they should all be one.
[3:09:25] &gt;&gt; Father with mother,
[3:09:29] &gt;&gt; the mother with the father,
[3:09:32] children with the parents,
[3:09:35] &gt;&gt; parent with the children,
[3:09:37] all in in agreement.
[3:09:41] And when you see that,
[3:09:46] &gt;&gt; you will see a lovely picture.
[3:09:50] &gt;&gt; That's it.
[3:09:51] &gt;&gt; A lovely picture.
[3:09:54] &gt;&gt; Quotation 17.
[3:09:56] &gt;&gt; He says,
[3:09:59] &gt;&gt; well,
[3:10:02] now Jesus prayed.
[3:10:07] Jesus prayed in John 17
[3:10:10] and verse 11
[3:10:14] &gt;&gt; 11th verse to you who put down these
[3:10:16] Sunday school texts
[3:10:22] I have many of them this morning
[3:10:25] John 17:11
[3:10:27] Jesus prayed
[3:10:30] &gt;&gt; that a church
[3:10:32] &gt;&gt; and he would be one
[3:10:36] like a he
[3:10:37] &gt;&gt; and a father. We're one.
[3:10:41] &gt;&gt; That a church.
[3:10:45] We as a members of the body of Christ
[3:10:48] would be one
[3:10:51] &gt;&gt; together just like he and the father are
[3:10:53] one.
[3:10:55] &gt;&gt; And at that day
[3:10:58] we wouldn't know that he was in the
[3:11:01] father
[3:11:03] rather father in him
[3:11:05] &gt;&gt; and he in us.
[3:11:09] that together we are we were one.
[3:11:13] &gt;&gt; What a union.
[3:11:17] &gt;&gt; What a oneness that would be
[3:11:22] &gt;&gt; to see God in his church. Amen.
[3:11:27] &gt;&gt; Till every member
[3:11:33] &gt;&gt; is a jester perfectly in harmony. Amen.
[3:11:38] &gt;&gt; Perfect harmony.
[3:11:40] &gt;&gt; Perfect harmony.
[3:11:45] &gt;&gt; Let me emphasize on this. Perfect
[3:11:48] harmony.
[3:11:50] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[3:11:51] &gt;&gt; Perfect harmony.
[3:11:52] &gt;&gt; Perfect harmony.
[3:11:56] &gt;&gt; You see today people are matching
[3:11:59] clothes. They are in harmony with
[3:12:01] clothes.
[3:12:04] Let me not go far.
[3:12:08] Uh here is a blue blazer suit
[3:12:13] &gt;&gt; and you as you can see a tie with some
[3:12:16] blue spots.
[3:12:19] &gt;&gt; As you can see blue socks.
[3:12:22] &gt;&gt; What are we looking for? Harmony.
[3:12:27] Lord my wish.
[3:12:30] My desire is that each member
[3:12:34] may you live in harmony.
[3:12:38] May you all live in harmony.
[3:12:41] &gt;&gt; So then my beloved brothers
[3:12:44] for that harmony to exist among us.
[3:12:48] No matter what your brother has done,
[3:12:52] we are living in the days of Yumip.
[3:12:56] The message of the end time
[3:12:59] &gt;&gt; is a message of Yomipur
[3:13:03] is a message of pardon,
[3:13:07] everything he has done,
[3:13:10] I've got some quotations,
[3:13:12] but the hour is
[3:13:14] he might have stolen something.
[3:13:17] He might have criticized you.
[3:13:20] He might have insulted you.
[3:13:23] But if you desire harmony,
[3:13:25] &gt;&gt; do as Jesus did.
[3:13:28] As Jesus was climbing on the cross,
[3:13:32] who uh h who delivered Jesus,
[3:13:36] who surrendered Jesus,
[3:13:39] that was his own brother
[3:13:42] out of the same tribe of Judah.
[3:13:46] As Jesus was climbing the mountain,
[3:13:49] Jesus looks
[3:13:50] &gt;&gt; and he says, "Father, father,"
[3:13:54] &gt;&gt; he never said, "Send them to hell.
[3:13:58] &gt;&gt; See how she's handing me over to be
[3:14:00] killed.
[3:14:02] They have I have seen flames from them.
[3:14:04] I have suffered.
[3:14:06] Send them to hell."
[3:14:08] &gt;&gt; What did he say?
[3:14:10] &gt;&gt; Father, father,
[3:14:12] &gt;&gt; forgive them. [cheering]
[3:14:16] Father forgive them.
[3:14:18] &gt;&gt; So then
[3:14:20] &gt;&gt; should your sister have wronged you,
[3:14:23] &gt;&gt; forgive them.
[3:14:25] This is a day of
[3:14:27] your husband has a chance of grace
[3:14:29] against you. Forgive him.
[3:14:32] Your children have wronged you. Forgive
[3:14:36] them.
[3:14:37] Love one another.
[3:14:41] &gt;&gt; And also support your pastor's affair.
[3:14:44] Pastor,
[3:14:44] &gt;&gt; the pastor's a family.
[3:14:48] &gt;&gt; Support the church.
[3:14:50] &gt;&gt; This is your family.

[3:20:13] We invited you
[3:20:16] and we pray Lord Almighty that you come
[3:20:18] and speak to us
[3:20:22] through our pastor Jango here.
[3:20:25] And father, what you said is nothing but
[3:20:28] a truth,
[3:20:30] nothing but an anointing,
[3:20:33] nothing but an inspiration.
[3:20:36] We are so thankful, Father, for that
[3:20:39] love.
[3:20:41] As he says some of the words, if we
[3:20:43] don't take them,
[3:20:46] we might miss a point.
[3:20:50] We are so grateful Lord Almighty to have
[3:20:52] a man of God
[3:20:54] that will come and display what God has
[3:20:59] given him Lord.
[3:21:01] &gt;&gt; And here we are Lord as believers.
[3:21:05] We are committing ourselves unto thee
[3:21:10] because Lord you shed your blood
[3:21:13] and you made promises to us and those
[3:21:17] promises we believe that they are divine
[3:21:20] and if they are divine Lord they will
[3:21:23] create a divine nature into us and we
[3:21:27] will long Lord and urge for a divine
[3:21:30] nature
[3:21:31] and a divine nature Lord is to long to
[3:21:34] do the right thing Lord which is the

[3:32:52] apostles, men and brethren, what shall
[3:32:55] we do? Then Peter said unto them,
[3:32:58] "Repent and be baptized, every one of
[3:33:01] you, in the name of Jesus Christ, for
[3:33:04] the remission of your sins.
[3:33:08] And you shall receive the gift of the

[3:40:50] Hallelujah.
[3:40:52] Can you come and pray for them? Baba.
[3:41:00] Okay, let's bow our head.
[3:41:04] Mighty God, eternal father,
[3:41:08] it's your word that that spoke about
[3:41:13] the massive and great promises.
[3:41:18] The promise was that they should repent
[3:41:22] and be baptized in the name of our Lord
[3:41:24] Jesus Christ for the remission of the
[3:41:27] sins.
[3:41:29] Then you will give them a gift, Father.
[3:41:34] That gift is the gift of the Holy
[3:41:36] Spirit.
[3:41:38] And that spirit will give them the
[3:41:41] knowledge and understanding. Father,
[3:41:46] backing up, Lord Almighty, laying a
[3:41:48] foundation, Lord Almighty,
[3:41:51] until they grow to their uh perfection,
[3:41:56] gracious Lord,
[3:41:59] it is that spirit, Lord Almighty, that
[3:42:01] will
[3:42:03] give them that type of growth.
[3:42:06] So we we have done our
[3:42:11] physical thing in taking the body
[3:42:15] uh just to show that dip him in the
[3:42:18] water is that the old man dies and
[3:42:21] picking him up is that now is now a new
[3:42:25] man
[3:42:26] &gt;&gt; and that new man is would be the
[3:42:29] heavenly one that will be built by the
[3:42:32] word that will be preached on him.
[3:42:35] So we commit them unto thee Lord
[3:42:37] Almighty. We know that the step that
[3:42:40] they have taken. It's like joining an
[3:42:43] army.
[3:42:45] The devil is not happy about it. So we
[3:42:48] pray Lord that you protect them Lord as
