[2:40] [Applause]
[2:42] again
[2:48] because the rapture is coming so i want
[2:50] to
[2:51] fit in
[2:54] [Music]
[2:57] for the
[2:58] the bible says
[3:00] narrow is the way
[3:02] really everything
[3:30] we won't be long but although god will
[3:34] help us to be
[3:35] specific
[3:43] straight to the boys
[3:47] amen amen
[3:50] especially that we have now
[3:53] arrived at the employer
[4:01] [Music]
[4:16] amen i think
[4:18] the
[4:21] believers have had when
[4:24] their seventh angel
[4:26] may say messenger
[4:28] these words
[4:40] then he said
[4:43] now let us he said you are we are
[4:47] now let us go
[4:51] the kitten of time
[5:22] foreign
[5:36] uh
[5:37] [Music]
[6:04] now this one dies the third one which is
[6:07] called
[6:08] the body
[6:13] mainly
[6:14] amen
[6:16] no matter how we love eden
[6:22] [Music]
[6:33] i can type to you that every time
[6:37] you buy a new car you are thinking of
[6:41] insurance
[6:59] is that the truth now
[7:02] when a child is born
[7:06] the first thing is fear for the child
[7:15] in the world of the unbelievers they
[7:17] will start calling in younger son gomer
[7:21] in what word because of
[7:24] fear
[7:25] fasting
[7:28] babies
[7:51] [Music]
[7:56] stand up for the reading of the words

[8:15] it will barely benefit only the one
[8:19] [Music]
[8:20] who has come
[8:22] to the end it felt like it goes
[8:38] we've got some believers that are still
[8:41] thinking of
[8:43] the time to come recently
[8:45] [Music]
[8:49] and then we have these believers who
[8:51] have already arrived
[8:58] like when
[9:00] enoch arrived

[9:05] then he walked with god
[9:11] and he was not me
[9:14] amen god took him
[9:17] god took him

[16:17] foreign
[17:26] then let's turn to hebrews chapter
[17:29] four
[17:38] five
[17:50] [Music]
[18:26] m
[18:41] [Music]
[18:54] okay
[19:02] [Music]
[19:21] me
[20:12] [Music]
[20:31] god will help us
[20:35] you know when
[20:37] things were going
[20:39] and getting tough for us the believers
[20:43] god helped us
[20:52] we managed to preach
[20:55] up to kali california and some places
[20:58] through the youtube
[21:09] and
[21:10] we are receiving from a response from
[21:14] these places
[21:28] the people uh thanking the lord for
[21:31] receiving the weight during
[21:33] the those lockdowns
[21:38] and look ups
[21:43] [Music]
[21:51] when the lord jesus left
[21:53] and then he said i shall not leave you
[21:56] alone miranda
[23:02] youtube and the supernatural we have the
[23:05] seventh season uh
[23:22] you know i think yesterday we we
[23:25] we did the read of script
[23:28] from the spoken word
[23:34] so there's so many people who do not
[23:37] even bother to
[23:39] read
[23:40] the spoken word
[23:43] [Music]
[23:44] spoken word
[23:47] but there's a reason why fellas
[24:31] [Music]
[25:12] then she came back but they're still
[25:14] sick
[25:18] i was with babies
[25:21] then i said to the sister
[25:24] you know you are sick because you are
[25:26] still in that other side of the
[25:29] of the sea
[25:34] or you are on the other side of jordan
[25:39] amen
[25:40] that's why you are
[25:53] in the name of the lord jesus christ of
[25:55] christ
[25:57] and the next thing she came to my house
[25:59] is another sister from the same place
[26:07] with the testimony that i told her that
[26:10] she should now cross over
[26:18] even god said to moses you've been
[26:20] remaining in this place
[26:25] [Music]
[27:15] that's why now they have started to
[27:17] protest
[27:23] [Music]
[27:50] they were remaining in the place where
[27:52] there was a disease
[28:13] they are still in the the time
[28:19] because once you take it a step forward
[28:24] you are you are leaving behind the old
[28:27] things
[29:24] and they got healed before
[29:27] that was their faith even illiterate
[29:30] and the one of them
[29:33] some of them they because always there's
[29:36] always one who start the thing
[29:49] while looking at the shadow of paul
[29:51] peterson
[30:20] here
[30:34] but she picked up something
[30:48] if i can touch
[31:01] because there was a revelation
[31:06] [Applause]
[31:16] what are you
[31:30] for me
[31:39] [Applause]
[31:39] [Music]
[32:02] [Music]
[32:12] yeah
[32:14] imagine you must look at the sign
[32:17] of
[32:18] is
[32:22] yes sir please do it
[32:29] [Applause]
[32:40] there's no way you can go come to god
[32:42] and live without
[32:45] something
[32:53] i
[32:55] it will like a healing campaign but i
[32:57] will say
[33:00] campaign
[33:04] you know
[33:05] once she realized she received that
[33:08] revelation that for her to touch the
[33:11] helm
[33:20] even
[33:22] failed to stop
[33:51] so
[33:52] because they were told that jesus is
[33:54] inside
[34:00] [Music]
[34:01] jesus jesus
[34:46] [Music]
[35:21] [Applause]
[35:33] [Applause]
[35:38] [Music]
[35:43] i said don't go back you'll find one
[35:46] child you'll find a child
[35:49] and this happens
[35:51] she got she conceived me
[35:56] what they did
[36:09] then the people inside would wonder
[36:22] revelation was pushing them
[36:39] come around
[36:40] hashes usually openly
[36:44] it's so hard
[36:46] and then when they look down like that
[36:51] they realized
[37:13] [Music]
[37:20] down
[37:26] to who we are
[37:28] which is
[37:30] you can fight him
[37:32] anywhere
[37:49] you can
[37:50] find a way okay
[37:58] jesus
[38:15] hebrews
[38:24] a promise being left as of entering into
[38:27] his rest
[38:29] any of you should seem to come short of
[38:33] it
[38:35] how do we find him
[38:37] amen
[38:41] a person
[38:58] [Music]
[39:25] could see the believers
[39:29] [Music]
[40:49] but because it was used by moses
[40:54] the bible calls it the road of muslims
[41:15] [Applause]
[41:16] is
[41:19] [Music]
[41:32] today you take a photo the people would
[41:34] be after you and not vote over jesus
[41:41] christ
[42:12] what do you have in your mind
[42:28] god made use of the thing that the
[42:30] people rejected
[42:40] and with that road
[42:48] [Music]
[43:23] because they were upfront
[43:53] [Music]
[44:15] the people who could see that they they
[44:18] could even say hey pharaoh is knowing
[44:20] the message
[44:23] [Music]
[44:41] all right
[44:42] now i'm trying to come through these
[44:45] stages quickly
[44:48] but
[44:50] [Music]
[45:15] now
[45:34] [Applause]
[45:37] they came out of the sea on the other
[45:39] side
[45:41] they looked back
[46:25] because all those men which have seen my
[46:28] glory and my miracles which i did in
[46:31] egypt and in the wilderness and have
[46:34] tempted me now these ten times and have
[46:37] not hated to my voice
[46:39] surely they shall not see the land which
[46:41] i swear unto their fathers
[46:43] neither shall any of them that provoke
[46:46] me
[47:04] foreign
[47:08] [Music]
[47:34] foreign
[48:20] why why i'm saying this breaking from
[48:23] holding people and i see lying here
[48:26] because somebody not not one person they
[48:29] always come
[48:30] to me
[48:31] with my ability to sing
[48:42] the bible says we should not say father
[48:44] to any man
[49:27] that's how the people read the bible
[49:29] without the spirits
[49:31] [Music]
[49:37] horses
[49:44] but let me cut it short okay paul says i
[49:47] am your father hold on
[49:50] hold on
[49:52] i will join you
[49:54] saying that to the children
[51:27] all right amen

[52:27] they died
[52:43] for unto us was the gospel preached as
[52:46] well as unto
[52:48] them
[53:08] for we
[53:09] who have believed to enter into
[53:40] yes but the word
[53:43] was even spoken before they will let you
[53:46] open
[53:48] so
[53:49] others entered
[53:52] in his rest
[54:09] you see the bible says
[54:11] they died in the wilderness
[54:16] the wilderness
[54:18] is the type of the second pool
[54:34] you have stages
[54:49] second is the wilderness

[1:07:35] the course but when you get over
[1:07:37] finishing
[1:08:09] from the seventh church

[1:15:38] and he tells us that what god is telling
[1:15:41] us

[1:20:23] come and find the pharisees the
[1:20:27] priests
[1:20:54] the thing is
[1:20:56] as they followed
[1:20:57] the stars
[1:21:26] and when they arrive in jerusalem
[1:21:28] jerusalem the star did not support them
[1:21:32] really

[1:51:20] [Music]
[1:51:31] you you have what you call
[1:51:35] a theophany analysis
[1:51:40] if your theophany can meet melchizedek

[1:54:26] christ should stick to the world
[1:54:29] he would do that
[1:54:30] to the church
[1:54:33] they should follow that this particular
[1:54:36] chip are not telling amen amen if they
[1:54:38] stop following the word
[1:54:43] they are in the message physically
[1:54:45] [Applause]
[1:55:01] he takes every weight from the prophet
[1:55:04] [Music]
[1:55:11] [Music]
[1:55:16] he doesn't inject himself with
[1:55:18] or of his own
