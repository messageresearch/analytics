[1:05:01] light there it's a proof that God has
[1:05:04] [Music]

[1:05:48] to other
[1:05:51] people we are the people to make the
[1:05:53] word of God known to
[1:05:59] who is going to make the word of God
[1:06:03] known
[1:06:06] you it is your
[1:06:08] duty that's why you are here on
[1:06:11] Earth to make the word of God being
[1:06:18] known you are as important as the sun
[1:06:23] is amen amen go down my
[1:06:27] brother
[1:06:30] amen I'll go I'll come back to 61 but
[1:06:33] let me go to 62 first yeah 62 62 some of
[1:06:38] the people argue today in our
[1:06:42] schools and so forth about the world
[1:06:44] being made
[1:06:49] Millions trying to condemn the Bible and
[1:06:51] say it's wrong
[1:06:55] don't read the
[1:06:57] Bible That's so because the Bible
[1:07:00] doesn't tell us how old the world
[1:07:04] is God the Bible said in the
[1:07:10] beginning God created the heavens and
[1:07:12] the
[1:07:14] Earth
[1:07:16] period
[1:07:18] when
[1:07:20] how that we don't know we don't know it
[1:07:25] now that's first that's
[1:07:29] period that's the end of the
[1:07:33] sentence that God created the heavens
[1:07:35] and the
[1:07:38] Earth how he did it we don't
[1:07:40] know hallelujah amen down a little bit
[1:07:43] my
[1:07:44] brother in the
[1:07:47] beginning God created the heavens and
[1:07:49] the Earth it might have been million
[1:07:51] years
[1:07:56] how he did
[1:07:58] it that's up to
[1:08:00] him to know see not me can I stop
[1:08:06] there amen amen so in the beginning what
[1:08:08] happened
[1:08:12] there uh I don't want to know so whether
[1:08:16] it was a big bang it was
[1:08:20] what whatever is happening
[1:08:23] there for me I got a duty to do
[1:08:26] today because my part has been given to
[1:08:30] me so the Earth was without
[1:08:34] form and
[1:08:36] void that means there was a
[1:08:40] chaos amen amen amen amen amen
[1:08:45] amen and the spirit of God moved
[1:08:50] upon one one more thing I have to I have
[1:08:53] to teach this morning I I believe I
[1:08:56] already told this
[1:08:58] one my brother what is what is
[1:09:04] Darkness last time I said tell you what
[1:09:06] is
[1:09:09] Darkness yes my sister you
[1:09:11] said what is
[1:09:14] darkness no yes but what is Darkness for
[1:09:17] us as
[1:09:20] Believers no no no no no from today
[1:09:23] onwards I come back ask
[1:09:28] again darkness is
[1:09:30] [Music]
[1:09:35] denominations hallelujah amen so what is
[1:09:40] Darkness
[1:09:42] denominations okay after knowing that
[1:09:46] let's go back to Genesis
[1:09:49] 1 1 ver2 amen
[1:09:53] amen Genesis 1:2
[1:09:56] yes and the Earth was without form and
[1:09:59] void yes and darkness was upon the face
[1:10:03] denominations were upon the face of the
[1:10:05] of the de
[1:10:09] yes that is yeah darkness is go and
[1:10:13] search in the message you find that
[1:10:14] darkness is denominational
[1:10:20] teachings and uh the dangerous thing
[1:10:26] is the next
[1:10:28] sentence and the spirit of God moved
[1:10:31] upon the face of the
[1:10:35] waters in that
[1:10:38] Darkness the spirit of God was
[1:10:43] moving you find people in the
[1:10:45] denomination they say hey the spirit of
[1:10:46] God was in me
[1:10:49] yes in Genesis the spirit of God is
[1:10:51] moving
[1:11:00] [Applause]
[1:11:02] am light is
[1:11:05] what the spoken
[1:11:07] [Music]
[1:11:08] word the spirit of God can move where
[1:11:11] the spoken is not
[1:11:18] there because according to
[1:11:20] Joel he says in the last days
[1:11:25] I will pour my
[1:11:28] spirit on all
[1:11:32] fresh what is
[1:11:34] fresh according to the scriptures
[1:11:36] according to the what
[1:11:40] US
[1:11:42] fresh no no no no no no what is
[1:11:46] fresh according to what brother
[1:11:53] us what is many people
[1:11:57] what is many people Waters what is many
[1:12:01] people
[1:12:03] beginning many people is water
[1:12:08] yes so water which is in
[1:12:12] darkness it's many people who
[1:12:15] are
[1:12:17] in which
[1:12:19] is denomination
[1:12:30] the spirit of God was
[1:12:32] moving many
[1:12:35] people who were in
[1:12:39] darkness all the way from
[1:12:49] Genesis without
[1:12:52] form void
[1:12:55] without
[1:12:57] [Music]
[1:13:00] order but the spirit was
[1:13:04] there one day there were 400 400
[1:13:10] prophets they were
[1:13:15] inspired when one turns this way the all
[1:13:18] 400 turn
[1:13:21] this they turn that
[1:13:23] way and the head of put
[1:13:29] horns so they were
[1:13:31] 400 so another
[1:13:34] brother
[1:13:37] came
[1:13:41] Chief I have heard this
[1:13:44] 400 isn't there
[1:13:50] one he wanted them to be 400
[1:13:54] [Music]
[1:13:59] soab no being a
[1:14:03] Jew he knew exactly what J
[1:14:09] meant he said yes my
[1:14:12] brother but I hate
[1:14:16] him if he comes
[1:14:18] here that'll be no good for
[1:14:22] me so the brother came
[1:14:27] his friends were warning him as they
[1:14:28] were
[1:14:30] coming you know brother uh
[1:14:34] here all your
[1:14:37] friends they have said good about the
[1:14:40] king when we take you from here and you
[1:14:43] go with us please just say good
[1:14:50] things it says okay I'll will say good
[1:14:53] things
[1:14:55] I say what I going to tell
[1:14:59] me so when he came to the church
[1:15:03] there uh he
[1:15:07] shouted uh good
[1:15:10] things the king says
[1:15:13] no you haven't said the way you always
[1:15:17] say say that say the
[1:15:19] Lord said oh
[1:15:22] now that say the Lord
[1:15:26] amen amen that's the
[1:15:28] difference then one of
[1:15:32] the the leading person on the
[1:15:38] group turn to him and hit
[1:15:44] him when did the spirit leave
[1:15:49] me you see why he was there he was
[1:15:52] moving like
[1:15:53] that the of can move where there's
[1:15:56] [Applause]
[1:16:00] Darkness so when God says let there be
[1:16:05] light he is

[1:18:50] brother without any controversy
[1:18:54] who was the first Bishop of the
[1:19:00] church who was the first Bishop of this
[1:19:04] church
[1:19:05] Peter who did the keys who who has left
[1:19:08] with the
[1:19:12] keys that these are the keys to
[1:19:17] Heaven
[1:19:19] who Peter hallelujah amen Peter was
[1:19:23] there for some years
[1:19:26] the
[1:19:28] church the church was going
[1:19:30] on amen amen amen amen amen amen amen
[1:19:36] amen amen
[1:19:38] amen who was the light of the
[1:19:49] day yeah that's where we are today we
[1:19:52] have to learn that one so who was the
[1:19:54] light of the
[1:19:56] day Peter was a bishop very
[1:20:01] Bishop but he did women col put on
[1:20:04] whatever they want to
[1:20:06] do the Jews run away from the
[1:20:10] Gentiles
[1:20:12] them he was
[1:20:15] P he himself wouldn't the Jews fearing
[1:20:18] the
[1:20:20] feeling so who came to correct that
[1:20:27] so who was the light of the
[1:20:30] day he came to
[1:20:34] separate the spirit was already
[1:20:38] moving the spirit was doing
[1:20:42] Miracles but they were able to leun away
[1:20:44] from Gentiles and blacks
[1:20:47] and
[1:20:49] they with am white
[1:20:53] [Music]
[1:20:57] but the spech is
[1:20:58] moving the word is
[1:21:02] moving so when Paul comes he come to
[1:21:06] tell them no no no no no no no the way
[1:21:09] you taking
[1:21:11] communion
[1:21:13] Darkness separate women keep
[1:21:18] quiet it doesn't matter whether you are
[1:21:21] the mother of Jesus or
[1:21:28] [Applause]
[1:21:31] you know people use relationships very
[1:21:33] hard keep
[1:21:37] quiet if you wife of Peter keep
[1:21:41] quiet who said
[1:21:45] that so who is the light of the
[1:21:48] day because he brought the light that's
[1:21:51] why you find in each and every chur
[1:21:56] you remember
[1:21:57] PO he was the the main
[1:22:01] Minister CH
[1:22:05] of actually irus was a student of
[1:22:11] Po the day which po was
[1:22:15] killed went to
[1:22:17] heaven those people who were believer
[1:22:19] that
[1:22:20] day saw his Spirit going to heaven
[1:22:25] as a dove and they head
[1:22:28] heaven
[1:22:30] singing welcoming
[1:22:33] po but when when the prophet
[1:22:38] comes
[1:22:40] says cannot be the
[1:22:43] light because he allowed Darkness to
[1:22:47] remain in the church
[1:22:54] so who was the
[1:22:57] light
[1:22:59] because so when it comes actually to
[1:23:02] come to
[1:23:03] [Music]
[1:23:04] Catholicism even if it was a small
[1:23:08] light you know the small Stars small
[1:23:10] small small
[1:23:12] Stars they shine a lot when it's dark
[1:23:15] that's
[1:23:16] why a small star like shine during the
[1:23:19] Catholic Times

[2:28:37] [Music]
[2:28:40] light the sun is a big big
[2:28:44] planet but it would have been not been
[2:28:48] able to make
[2:28:51] light was not moving very very
[2:28:55] fast and turning
[2:28:58] upon because that
[2:29:03] Force creates a
[2:29:08] gravity towards the center of the
[2:29:12] Sun the center of the sun is so
[2:29:18] prized and it
[2:29:21] ignites to give up nuclear
[2:29:25] fusion hallelujah amen for those young
[2:29:28] people who are studying physics or you
[2:29:29] have
[2:29:31] already you see that's the way they make
[2:29:33] a nuclear
[2:29:35] bomb they fire from different
[2:29:39] places toward the
[2:29:43] plutonium the plum core becomes so
[2:29:48] compressed from there then
[2:29:51] BL so you cannot give out
[2:29:55] light unless you squeeze yourself
[2:29:59] squeeze yourself squeeze yourself
[2:30:02] squeeze
[2:30:03] squeeze move on brother move
[2:30:06] on that's when you bur out
[2:30:12] [Applause]
[2:30:15] and you don't give out light while
[2:30:17] sitting comfortably
[2:30:23] the sun is moving at a very high
[2:30:27] stage about 1 1 million km 1 million km
[2:30:32] per
[2:30:36] second the center of the
[2:30:38] gy at the same
[2:30:45] time that's the way it gives outl
[2:30:50] so if you see a big star which can
[2:30:52] become a
[2:30:56] supernova which is a very bright
[2:30:59] [Music]
[2:31:00] thing how does it become a
[2:31:04] Supernova by squeezing so
[2:31:09] much so much so much until the M of the
[2:31:16] Earth can can fit in a tennis ball
[2:31:21] when it does that when bur
[2:31:29] become how are we going to give
[2:31:31] ourselves
[2:31:33] light it's not about it's not about
[2:31:35] expanding
[2:31:37] ourselves it's about squeezing
[2:31:40] ourselves making ourselves very
[2:31:44] small very very small that's when you
[2:31:47] out
[2:31:53] it's about self
[2:31:55] sacrifice
[2:32:02] [Applause]
[2:32:04] not amen amen this
[2:32:07] life is about
[2:32:10] what
[2:32:13] sacrifice we

[2:33:05] ourselves my brother my sister up
[2:33:08] there it's about squeezing
[2:33:12] ourselves if you have
[2:33:21] amen because that's how the Sun gives
[2:33:23] out
[2:33:27] light that's the way the
[2:33:33] Supernova because God's God God obeys
[2:33:38] his own
[2:33:44] laws amen we need to squeeze ourselves

[3:30:35] and said unto Peter and to the rest of
[3:30:38] the Apostles men and Brethren what shall
[3:30:41] we do then Peter said unto them repent
[3:30:45] and be baptized everyone of you in the
[3:30:48] name of Jesus Christ for the remission
[3:30:50] of sins and he shall receive the gift of
[3:30:53] the Holy Ghost for the promise is unto
