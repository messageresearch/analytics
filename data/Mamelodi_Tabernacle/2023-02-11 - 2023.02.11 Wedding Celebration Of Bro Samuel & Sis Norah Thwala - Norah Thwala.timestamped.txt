[1:40:48] that is introducing ourselves
[1:40:53] amen amen
[1:40:56] now the scripture says
[1:41:01] and I will say for a few minutes
[1:41:07] and I'll take the scripture versage
[1:41:17] brother
[1:41:19] are we in Ephesians chapter 5 verse 30.
[1:41:25] yes
[1:41:27] 34 we are members of his body of his
[1:41:30] flesh and of his bones
[1:41:32] for this cause shall a man leave his
[1:41:35] father and mother and shall be joined
[1:41:38] unto his wife and they too shall be one
[1:41:41] flesh this is a great mystery but I
[1:41:44] speak concerning Christ in the church
[1:41:47] nevertheless let every one of you in
[1:41:50] particular so love his wife even as
[1:41:53] himself and the wife see that she
[1:41:55] reverends her husband
[1:41:57] we may be seated God bless you
[1:42:00] say all right
[1:42:06] brother let us introduce ourselves we
[1:42:10] are members
[1:42:12] let's see it I see we are members of
[1:42:17] this boat of his body okay
[1:42:22] now this is marriage
[1:42:27] they call it the first institution but
[1:42:31] it is
[1:42:34] that God introduced
[1:42:37] amen amen and firstly
[1:42:43] uh if I read
[1:42:46] umang Funda
[1:42:48] chapter 5 of Genesis
[1:42:54] I find
[1:42:56] uh
[1:42:59] where
[1:43:01] it's it says
[1:43:06] one this is the book of the generations
[1:43:10] of Adam in the day that God created man
[1:43:14] in the likeness of God made him
[1:43:21] yes
[1:43:28] first two male and female created he
[1:43:32] them and bless them and call their name
[1:43:38] can somebody say
[1:43:39] Adam Adam
[1:43:51] uh
[1:43:52] called their name
[1:43:55] Adam
[1:43:57] not other men if
[1:44:00] Adam Adam and
[1:44:04] God bless you
[1:44:07] when Adam in the day when they were
[1:44:10] created
[1:44:15] they were called
[1:44:20] foreign Adam
[1:44:22] amen the name if came later after the
[1:44:26] fall is
[1:44:30] God called them Adam and Adam called her
[1:44:34] if
[1:44:35] um
[1:44:41] so
[1:44:48] I think we are aware of that
[1:44:51] meaning that marriage is a restoration
[1:44:58] because they were one and that the name
[1:45:01] was one
[1:45:06] but the fall separated them
[1:45:11] when the serpent came and mud the plan
[1:45:14] of God
[1:45:16] is a
[1:45:18] important and Adam said to
[1:45:22] the woman uh
[1:45:29] that is a
[1:45:32] Genesis
[1:45:34] chapter 3 verse
[1:45:38] 20. and Adam called his wife's name Eve
[1:45:42] because she was the mother of all living
[1:45:45] right
[1:45:46] foreign
[1:45:58] [Music]
[1:46:01] he called them
[1:46:03] Adam
[1:46:04] um
[1:46:07] but after the fall Emperor Adam not God
[1:46:12] now
[1:46:14] awesome
[1:46:15] his wife's name
[1:46:20] why because he she
[1:46:23] is the mother of all living
[1:46:29] that means she's the mother of Kane
[1:46:32] she's the mother of Abel
[1:46:37] now the name has changed
[1:46:41] all right now for a few minutes
[1:46:46] um
[1:46:49] we read here now we are the members of
[1:46:52] his body is okay
[1:46:58] of his flesh and of his bones amen
[1:47:08] that's why in reality
[1:47:11] you won't find divorce
[1:47:14] in there
[1:47:17] in the family of God
[1:47:22] um foreign
[1:47:30] now
[1:47:32] how can one
[1:47:34] divorce itself
[1:47:42] you see my fingers
[1:47:51] it can't because it is
[1:47:55] the two shall be one yeah
[1:48:01] and if God puts them together
[1:48:05] he says no one should put them as under
[1:48:08] again
[1:48:11] because in God they should
[1:48:17] remains
[1:48:21] just a little bit now it says for we are
[1:48:26] members so we as
[1:48:28] Christians here we are his body Tina
[1:48:32] generals
[1:48:35] for this course
[1:48:38] a man live his father and mother and
[1:48:43] child be joined unto his wife
[1:48:51] because originally God never said
[1:48:55] girlfriend he said amen the language was
[1:48:58] wife
[1:49:04] have you ever had anything or God
[1:49:07] promising a girlfriend
[1:49:10] a boyfriend
[1:49:20] that is from creation
[1:49:25] the woman the Bible says the woman was
[1:49:28] created for the man later pipelines
[1:49:33] Lisa you'll find it in your Bible
[1:49:36] where it is
[1:49:39] Corinthians chapter
[1:49:42] 7 if you are sure read it foreign
[1:49:58] to demand
[1:50:01] the the woman was created for the man
[1:50:08] amen amen starting there from the
[1:50:12] creation
[1:50:16] so now it says
[1:50:19] do you find
[1:50:21] do you find that scripture
[1:50:24] I think you were looking for chapter
[1:50:27] eight
[1:50:28] yeah or you are looking for
[1:50:31] say it
[1:50:34] chapter 7 verse
[1:50:37] okay all right let's carry on
[1:50:42] I read here therefore we are members of
[1:50:45] this body
[1:50:47] we are members of his body
[1:50:50] of his flesh of his bones
[1:50:54] for this course
[1:50:57] shall a man leave his father and mother
[1:51:00] and shall be joined unto his wife amen
[1:51:16] are you still looking for that script
[1:51:20] seven that's right
[1:51:23] for a man indeed ought not to cover his
[1:51:26] head for as much as he is the image and
[1:51:29] glory of God but the woman is the glory
[1:51:33] of the man for the man is not of the
[1:51:35] woman but the woman of the man
[1:51:39] neither was the Man created for the
[1:51:41] woman but the woman for the men
[1:51:44] yes
[1:51:46] the the woman was created
[1:51:50] for the man
[1:51:54] that's wonderful
[1:51:56] all right
[1:51:58] so
[1:52:01] she's a help meet from the creation
[1:52:04] itself
[1:52:06] um
[1:52:10] now I met a woman she used to work at
[1:52:15] Standard Bank again
[1:52:18] Standard Bank thank you you managed to
[1:52:21] go through and find that scripture
[1:52:26] I met her I said
[1:52:29] I didn't see you these days behind the
[1:52:34] I was Muslim the Disco what do you call
[1:52:37] it the bank account
[1:52:40] um
[1:52:43] and then she said to me
[1:52:46] I'm no longer working
[1:52:50] she said because
[1:52:52] God said to Adam
[1:52:55] I will make you Catalina
[1:52:58] watches
[1:53:01] amen amen so I was just helping him
[1:53:06] and I said how do you know that part of
[1:53:08] the Bible
[1:53:11] said yes
[1:53:13] okay that's that now I read it
[1:53:18] for we are members of his body
[1:53:23] of his flesh of his bones now for this
[1:53:29] cause
[1:53:32] Shah a man leave his father and mother
[1:53:37] [Music]
[1:53:39] now allow me to repeat this
[1:53:46] you know Adam was not born
[1:53:50] Adam was created
[1:53:55] after Satan murdered the plan of God
[1:54:03] it was by creation
[1:54:11] that's why we must be born again
[1:54:17] because the Bible says man born of four
[1:54:22] of a woman
[1:54:25] but a few days
[1:54:28] that's why this body of mine
[1:54:32] foreign
[1:56:06] because this one came by predestination
[1:56:09] of God
[1:56:14] the two here's the marriage the other
[1:56:18] one created for another
[1:56:23] now it's a
[1:56:25] 80 for for for this course
[1:56:29] for this course that we are members of
[1:56:32] his body and of his flesh and of his
[1:56:34] bones
[1:56:38] shall a man leave his father and mother
[1:56:42] because originally he had no father and
[1:56:45] mother for months
[1:56:52] who was the mother of Adam
[1:56:55] who was the father foreign
[1:57:18] and to his wife because already
[1:57:23] according to the program of amen
[1:57:34] you know that's why
[1:57:37] was that a man now
[1:57:42] Abraham when he sent out the eldest in
[1:57:46] his house
[1:57:53] he said to him go and find a wife for my
[1:57:59] son whatever okay
[1:58:21] not and look for foreign
[1:58:37] Rebecca
[1:58:45] and the Bible says
[1:58:48] the elders in the house of Abraham
[1:58:53] when he arrived there it was in the
[1:58:56] evening time
[1:58:58] [Music]
[1:59:05] amen amen in the evening time is
[1:59:13] women came for to collect water
[1:59:18] in the evening time
[1:59:22] after the hours
[1:59:28] Let Me Maybe say this to you again now
[1:59:35] at that time
[1:59:38] after the hours
[1:59:42] women came to collect water
[1:59:47] commands and you can all you all know
[1:59:52] they were not at their best
[1:59:57] they were tipped they had taken off what
[2:00:01] they had during the day
[2:00:04] because it is the time when women
[2:00:07] start to be busy
[2:00:14] collecting water
[2:00:16] so they they can be at their business
[2:00:21] why because she was not supposed to look
[2:00:25] at the hair best
[2:00:30] she was a wife
[2:00:33] to the son of Abraham when daughter
[2:00:40] came only to find yeah why where's
[2:00:52] he gave him the science
[2:00:55] and the man was also struggling the
[2:00:58] messenger
[2:01:00] how do I find a wife
[2:01:06] of not just a mere man but for a son of
[2:01:23] going to look because uh like if God
[2:01:27] sends out somebody
[2:01:29] to find his bride
[2:01:34] um
[2:01:36] the bread of Christ
[2:01:42] what kind of man this man should be
[2:01:46] young
[2:01:50] and how will his mind operates or his
[2:01:54] thoughts
[2:02:02] you know it won't just be a woman
[2:02:06] should be something very special because
[2:02:12] all right now
[2:02:15] that man started
[2:02:18] to look for a wife
[2:02:22] you know until she arrived at the well
[2:02:28] you know what what happened there
[2:02:33] because she was asking
[2:02:37] she didn't want to to do something wrong
[2:02:43] amen amen that assignment you know
[2:02:47] he must be
[2:02:50] she must choose the right one
[2:02:54] how do you choose the right one
[2:02:58] um
[2:02:59] you can't unless the Bible says
[2:03:03] she was created for him
[2:03:10] all right
[2:03:17] how did you find your the right one
[2:03:21] um
[2:03:22] [Applause]

[2:03:29] on something you know what talking today
[2:03:42] oh that's enough
[2:03:48] I prayed
[2:03:52] if you haven't yet received the Lord
[2:03:55] Jesus Christ
[2:03:58] you can marry
[2:04:01] because you can't even make the right
[2:04:04] choice
[2:04:06] because the right trains can be made
[2:04:09] only in Christ
[2:04:41] [Applause]
[2:04:57] he came to redeem us foreign
[2:05:32] no
[2:05:41] he went
[2:05:43] he went down why it said his answer
[2:05:46] waited there
[2:05:49] women came up
[2:05:51] that evening
[2:05:54] but she prayed she couldn't choose but
[2:05:58] why not was okay and say this one
[2:06:01] again
[2:06:03] but she prayed
[2:06:05] for God to make the choice
[2:06:10] there's so many of them
[2:06:13] yes but which one here
[2:06:19] God had to give direction
[2:06:29] about Rebecca
[2:06:33] he started by
[2:06:35] asking for water he started like that
[2:06:41] she said I shall not only give to you
[2:06:45] what again
[2:06:53] I shall continue to serve because
[2:07:01] [Music]
[2:07:04] um

[2:07:10] [Music]
[2:07:39] so by the signs that
[2:07:42] God gave to him

[2:16:12] female and said for this cause shall a
[2:16:15] man live father and mother and shall
[2:16:18] cleave to his wife and their twin shall
[2:16:21] be one flesh
