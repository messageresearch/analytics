Description:
Title:The End of The Seventh Seal Vol 3
Text: The End of The Beginning

This message was preached by pastor Israel Nkodima on 29 January 2023 at Mamelodi Tabernacle South Africa

The purpose of this sermon was to show the audience about the three thrones. The Pastor read Revelation 4: 1 - 2 
“After this I looked, and, behold, a door was opened in heaven: and the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trumpet talking with me; which said, Come up hither, and I will shew thee things which must be hereafter. 2 And immediately I was in the spirit: and, behold, a throne was set in heaven, and one sat on the throne. The bride of Christ receieves the word from the throne. God operates from His throne to the throne in us.”

The Pastor indicated that the first throne was in Heaven, the second throne in Christ Jesus and the third in a Man.

He made reference by reading the Spoken Words of 
61-0101 - Revelation, Chapter Four #2 “Now, listen close. Then the Shekinah Glory raised from that mercy seat one day, and It settled on another Tabernacle (Amen!), this One, “The Father judges no man but He’s committed all judgment to the Son.” God’s Judgment Seat. Whew! “You speak against Me, it’ll be forgiven you,” speak another—another One coming, another Mercy Seat. “Speak…you speak against the Son of man, I will forgive you; but someday the Holy Spirit will come to dwell in the hearts of the people, one word against It will never be forgiven.”
   
He also read John 14: 3 - 10. Jesus saying unto Thomas; I am the way, the truth, and the life. The pastor showing that Jesus said I am the way not I have the way. We are not looking for his way but we are part of his way.

beautiful I'm not talking about godimane I'm talking about brother the Elder Mary means how God has blessed him together with us together with brother gabrielson together with the others but because I'm coming to this and he is much on the threefold a revelation okay now you know you understand what is threefold oh but it says yeah okay Christ in me makes me part makes me actually part of the threefold revelation if you are also part of that you will say Amen okay all my soul rejoices in him this opens to me another place in Revelation a deeper responsibility with my Lord Jesus amen amen Amen to know as I was known he knew me yet he loved me He Who glorifies make their Heavens shine Muhammad a prophetic placing this is perfect putting me in the constellation with Christ Jesus so very wonderful in my heart thanks seven colors of the rainbow behold in the father's face foreign I must have known can you but his deeper plane is how he was love God is my friend too my dear brother we knew him each other foreign eternity awaits dear brother now that's why I went further to these threefold we are more a three-folding now we are going to see that uh the throne also is in three-fold and now we have here part that the prophet calls the final through as we have three fold fools yeah the first one you read Revelation chapter four oh shall we stand up and I don't know Revelation chapter four that's what verse 1 to 11. we want to read the whole part but it tells us off a throne that was said foreign [Music] after this I looked and behold a door was open in heaven and the first voice which I heard was as itway of a trumpet talking with me which said come up hither and I will show these things which must be here after and immediately I was in the spirit and behold a throne was set in heaven and one sat on the throne amen you remember we are coming to the throne Revelation chapter 5. meaning that a door the wait said come up here and I will show you things to come to come from where the door is open so that for to see the things to come okay amen and then it says here now uh that is the fruit number one firstly the door was opened as he said come come up I'll show you things too to come now for for us to see the things to come the door should be opened everybody and when the door was opened that's why today we are seeing things not of this world but things that came through the door they opened the door amen amen then second John John is it John 14. Johanna chapter 14. verse 8 to 10. tell us what what's on the scripture Philip said unto him Lord show us the father and it suffices us Jesus said unto him have I been so long time with you and yet has thou not known me Philip he that hath seen me has seen my father and how said thou then show us the father okay that one is taking us to this threefold he that see me see that he that has seen me has seen the father is putting you together if you have seen me you have seen the father and to see the father you should see me this is what he is saying the Lord Jesus Christ because it is coming down the three-fold if you see me you have seen the father it's it's one thing then but we come to this where where's the page more okay firstly let us ask baby just for a word of prayer because already we are reading the word of God but I'm looking for my patient speaking about the Third through it is somewhere just here oh yeah here my brother okay this year amen let me read this our Elder will read for us we will pray amen amen Revelation chapter 4 part two okay spoken with Revelation chapter four page 60 27.627. Glory raised from that Mercy Seat one day and it's settled on another Tabernacle later because it says the father judges no man but he has committed all judgment to the son you know it said on another foreign you speak against me it will be forgiven you and and the other one coming oh um that is another messy City you can speak against the son of man I will forgive you but someday the Holy Spirit Will come down to dwell in their hearts of their people one wait against it [Music] it will never be forgiven did you hear it okay only one word against it now he's running he was in the heavens above and shining in the stars the second was on Earth shining through the Shekinah Glory yeah next he come and was made flesh and dwell Among Us still wearing his patience he redeemed Man by his blood came into his church in the form of the Holy Ghost speaking against that is finished now you can see that here where there he says shaking come on time they don't realize people can't comprehend what it means now the first rule was in heaven judgment seats the second in Christ when he start to speak is from his throne then the next time you'll hear from the second throw then even to the final throw and that's all well foreign [Music] not advise you but let me say this there was as I used the word buddy now somebody challenged that and say the Bible says call no man father I said yes we were working um through the gate like that I said you have her father he said yes I said truly you have a father the Bible says no many fathers and how do you address your father he said father you are father I said but the Bible says call no man father amen then he was dizzy then I said brother before you try to interpret anything make sure you you you know Paul says I continue to say to him Paul says I am your guitar now what do you say and he said sorry sorry okay uh just a prayer for us let's explore here to entry gracious Lord it is through your grace that we are standing here this morning it is through your grace that our pastor has this revelation of a threefold it is through your grace father that today we are able to reach the revelation of this promises that you have given us father it's a promise that needs to be manifested and father we live in the day where we see the signs we live in the time where the signs are telling and the science will also Lord coordinate with your servant here on Earth Lord to see these things because you are the one that just made him a leader you are the one that has given a ship to lead and father you will be the one that will give him food so that we could be fed now we are saying to thee gracious Lord that we are really fed and we are so thankful father your way it says that you'll give us knowledge and understanding but gracious Lord you have even give us of the revelation of yourself and this revelation of yourself Lord encourse us we feel so encouraged gracious Heavenly Father we feel so blessed Lord when you revealed yourself gracious Heavenly Father it is the time now that whatever you have given us Lord manifest in US we'd like to thank you Father for giving us time to sit down and father Ponder upon this word and meditate upon these things that the pastor is preaching us and it gives us life Lord we are so jubilant Lord Almighty to be in this day the scriptures that have been read father needs to be expounded we are the one Lord Almighty that will expand it and we see how Lord Almighty you came down in this method gracious Heavenly Father moving from one Throne to to another Throne how you unfold yourself until father you we become yourself Lord we'd like to thank you Father for everything Lord take control once again Lord and bless us yes that we pray calling upon the precious name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen ah you may be seated God bless you okay it's so easy to find a church but it's difficult for people to find the throne [Music] it's so easy to hear about the king but to arrive at this Throne is something else amen amen amen no that's why I believe that to find a place for to worship with something else to find a change is something else but to find his throne it's something different all right amen and you know where the Prophet says the throne is can only be seen from the inside you don't you don't just look around foreign now the only way you can find a throne that is from foreign amen yeah now meaning that if you are a true worshiper 180 you will find the FED through [Music] um yeah and that's what he's coming foreign and now we are going to look at these things all right I'll read the Bible Revelation chapter 4. let me try this oh the Bible sorry sorry brethren foreign no problem no problem brother God bless you here we go amen where's yours Revelation chapter four amen now I realize the Elder was talking about the Third the threefold okay then I looked back again for the threefold okay 340. which last time we went that was I think our title last the seventh seal is the end of office was it so now or was it song the title last time what was it like we really yes the end of the seventh seventh seal my friend yeah now only that year I was riding while talking here at home the the seventh seal is the end of all things it's still the same thing yeah and I'm going back to how it was foreign um I'm trying not to run okay let me find out okay it says yes from one of the books here oh yeah okay amen yeah I I believe you are not expecting like a fireworks you are expecting the way are they expected fireworks amen I can preach and run around top of the table but uh I haven't seen the Lord Jesus doing that yes and he will say to any through Stone and tell them about their Kingdom now I want us to look at the Kingdom amen amen now as certain as I stand in the platform tonight I had the Revelation that revealed it's in a three-fold manner okay I mean now three-fold puts you in that threefold you are part of the threefold so that when he speaks what happened is weird or the revelation flash through the threefold if it are more um those who will receive it are those that are in the free phones now it says you know if we go back Cod 14 years you listen because I'm going to take some few minutes and I'm gonna leave it there the message is over if you could understand that now if God created men in his own image in his own likeness what kind of man did he create now I I come here he was in other words Adam the first man in the lower creations of God now this is creation because you have Adam the body there but you have Adam who the spirit that was put into the body Adam we have read even last time that everything that was created has an end foreign that's why uh the last king we we have seen is he was the first king there with Abraham but Abraham met him when he was on his way to the city he was looking for the city now that's why even today because Abraham Abraham who was looking for a city he came to where he met the king of that City yeah we too lyric should come to where Abraham met the king thank you before we can enter the city amen now the seat of Abraham must find the place you know they must find this uh kimchio funny [Applause] the king without the beginning of days so in in his migration with his people it's end up that saying they met he met the king all right amen then it says here he met he he went up to where the city will come on he was still here on Earth but he came to the place where the city will come now he met Melchizedek and uh so now why because the other seed of the Seed of Abraham very Abraham was coming to the same place now like we we hear ourselves we come looking for a city all right now while looking for a city because this migration started with Abraham and all the Seed of Abraham was supposed at the end of time to come in the fold so that we will together what a little more be greeted in the city okay but we Too lyrics we come to a place where we meet the king did you understand when I read that last time that he is he is now a king or he is I don't know if you understood that is okay because the revelation of the seventh seals breaks the whole thing is which we will look at it right let me read here Adam the first man in the lower creations of God now we are talking about Adam the first creation was God himself but it is a creation that was not created then out of God came the logos what are logos which was the son of God then out of the logos which was the word and the way it was with God amen amen now you are going back in the beginning was the word now you are going back the word was with God you can't go forward with that you must go backwards the word was with God and then you must go back and the way it was you can run forward with that you always going back amen amen where it started and the Word was was God all right now uh the logos which was the son of God then out of the logos which was the weight in the beginning was the weight and the weight was with God and the weight was God and the weight was made flesh and dwell Among Us amen now out of the logos came forth the men amen amen saw a brother memes was talking to me last time the logos men logos you know you are a man yeah um but it depends whether you are the logos man the Bible says flesh shall not inherit the kingdom of God flesh and blood amen so the logos men in their body all right amen but now the seven the seventh sea let let's read it and close the revelation of the seventh sale it's not a church play that's why I don't belong to any church I belong to Christ you should not belong to a church because churches have God's spirits that's right amen amen now we should belong to Christ to Christ let me leave it there for a bit for a while I'm going back to this now as certain as I stand in the platform you know sometimes you are you are talking you are talking to the man the flesh you come for the second time in trying to talk to the soul you ask many people have you heard the message today he says yes yes brother but that would be only in flesh but you come again have you heard the message and uh you'll see whether yes is the flesh or it is the inner men now let me read to you again I don't know the first time whether it dropped in a flesh or in the soul and now as certain as I stand in the platform he said that that he said tonight I I heard the Revelation that revealed now you have your already I've read to you the three folders threefold let's read let's go back to that three-fold in the creation after it says out of the of God came the logos which was the son of God then out of the logos which was the word in the beginning then out of the logos [Music] where's my Bible amen look at this here John chapter 14 John 14. um how many have fallen asleep John 14. verse now let's start here verse 7. if he had known me you should have known my father also yeah do you hear what he's saying now if you have that is still that is threefold it's only threefold the elephant if you have known me you should also have known my father right Amen Let con let's continue that is verse 7. verse seven if you have known me you should have known my father also and from henceforth you know him it does apply in the threefold but hence you have known me listen if it were you brother that day the Lord Jesus saying to you you have known me on TV amen amen and he says or he continued from henceforth uh he is applying the threefold and and from henceforth well you have known him and they have seen him you know you have known him brings them in their food if you know me if you have known me then you have known my father this is actually what he is saying because it is applied in a three-fold all right that's why he says he that has seen me has seen the father it is working through the three four three four three four you can't say you have seen him but we haven't seen the father it is not threefold I be threefold amen now that's how God has put it to be in that form threefold if he says something it is applied through throughout the threefolding it is said by you if it is said by the sun it is uh-huh because it is even applied from the threefold that's why the world the people so confused because if I am not part of the threefold I'll keep on saying it was not it is not revealed until to the end it is not available now he continues to say um what was it where was that let's start here verse 3. and if I go and prepare a place for you I will come again and receive you unto myself literally okay unto myself because you are part of the threefolds now he can leave you behind him threefold River it's a great revelation I will I will receive you come he can't leave his threefold his part okay then you continue I will come again and receive you unto myself myself it doesn't say my room or my house myself because you should be you are part of myself that where I am you there he may be also you must be where I am living you are part of me yes amen and where I go you know Liberty [Applause] are you listening to the scripture where I go since you are part of him so you should know because you are part where I go you know he didn't say you will know you know because and the way you know listen yeah it's he who if you don't know you are going to keep quiet here the way you know Thomas said Thomas unto him you know he is he is talking to the three foods that is himself in a three-fold he says where I go we are also going you know where I am that's right here where I am now fine Best Buy uh verse 5 Thomas said unto him Lord we know not where thou goal is you know contradiction now and how can we know the way and Jesus said unto him I am the way amen amen you don't need a map or what do you call you using your card yes you don't need that Thomas I also okay so we're not Thomas no you only need to be part of me I am the way cannot feel I mean you don't need to learn about it you don't need to go to Bible school now for you to know the way that's when you are part of me amen all right this hey he puzzled Thomas where I go you know and the way let's see you know he is talking to the entire three-fold if he's going that way he is going that way in a three-fold so Thomas you know Thomas was he this six amen Jesus said unto him that's why I am the way he didn't say I have the way are you in the service amen he didn't say I have the way I may we are not looking for his ways we are part of his way all right amen I am the way see like in the truth literature somebody saying uh you know I'm looking for a church that speaks the truth no you won't find it okay wait you'll only know the truth if you are part of he says end their life I am good not I have it's already I'm the way Godzilla and I am the way the truth amen amen don't don't try to tell the truth but you should be the truth that's why some people he will tell the truth there and there you will tell lies trying to escape through and so forth but actually you should be the truth you should be the word as the the prophet of God says amen if the husband is the wage is the way killing amen otherwise there won't be any agreement in the family [Music] the word Angel if it's the way the body should be the way Evie is the truth the body should be the truth amen his entire body is the truth amen amen that's why I didn't say I have the truth no that will take you to Bible School this I am the way the truth and the life no man cometh unto the father but by me amen there's no other way by me that's when you are part of him right amen you can't train him you are part of him did you know that you can't train this message that's why after draining next time you'll find it faulty and say the reason I'm leaving this message because you have never never believed the message I mean you have drained a church into integrate now if you say we are Glory because this message he said behold I'll send you Elijah the prophets you can drain that Prophet okay because if you join him later he'll call him a cult that will be your nature showing amen amen you can't join him you can't join God all right now the people come and live come and live come here because they join me they are not part of it show me one person after saying the reason I left and you look at that person and now you see God foreign [Music] that's the reason the reason she left it is because she couldn't do her thing I've never called somebody's name I'm talking about the nature of things you won't go far with God because that's against your nature [Applause] the nature of God is holiness all right now this seven I mean if he had known me listen closely if you have known me you should have known my father we are talking we are talking about the threefold here if you have known me you should have known my father and from henceforth you know him and have seen you are part of his threefold yeah that's what he says all right Philip Philip you you the whole John 14 John 14 yeah he was killing them saying to them this is the threefold and you are part of it and they were asking no Lord tell us now listen to it now now here who's this one now Philly Philly Philip said unto him you know they say threefold threefold yeah um is a revelation of God Amen when he starts to unfold it he will tell you that you know the truth you know their father you know the way that is unfolding of the threefold I don't know if somebody has said this unfolding he is unfolding himself that you are part of me amen you have seen the father now now listen this Brothers Here struggling all right amen it is Thomas it is they are struggling yeah and because he is telling that he's telling them that you are part of me listen now verse 8. Philip said unto him Lord she was the father because he says you know the father show us the father and it's officials and Jesus said unto him have I been with you such a long time foreign have I been with amen have I been such a long time with you yeah and yet it has doubt not known me yes he that has seen me have seen the father who wanted I mean in a three-fold if you see the sun you've seen the father when I thought if you have seen the the father you have seen the Sun [Applause] okay talking to his part to put it positionally all right to put his own part position it is like The Family Man calling the family family trying to teach their Oneness and their family saying are you wife We Are One flesh and the new children you are my Offspring amen amen you know his own threefold in the house he wants everyone to know that he is part amen in the family yeah for me and should they receive the Revelation the wife it will be a great family it's our family each and everyone could recognize even in the church it is just like that as there was one who said we must help the parts stop because he's not educated can that be my pastor my pastor saying my pastor is not educated no I must help him a sheep coming to the pasta saying since you are not dedicated do you call that a pasta past Tyson was not made through education [Applause] you find a high pasta and I'll tell you you listen to this man listen to him you hear things he hasn't a God and that said the Lord because he says you know according to my according to myself amen I studied this in England you know I studied bch and you know yes God that is your educated but you find the real Pastor it is I'm trying to read this Philip Philip he that has seen me has sin not will sin the father it's also of one attack no he that has seen have seen the father yay this language it puts you in you know in a threefold and now and how says that then show us the father these things were happening because their Holy Ghost had not not yet come on because after the holy ghosts all right because he was part of it houses you know this day the day of John 14 it was a tough day for Christ and his followers foreign foreign what do you mean okay I think if somebody was there somebody who was just a visitor he would go home and say hey that church is tough that system is tough system they're the leader with some questions and he's trying to put it to them you know yeah [Music] yeah it was a tough day like this day of the seventh seeds among that's why I don't belong to a message no we do not belong to the message churches have got some spirits men you should belong to Christ amen not to what do you call the message right I'm finishing capitalism uh I think was Philip the last one amen why how come you say show us the father you've been part of it but the Lord knew that when the Holy Ghost shall come upon them then they will know amen Believers doubt not that I am in my father and the father in me um right amen foreign belief but at that time because the Holy Ghost had not yet come on he kept on talking about my father and me I am my father was it diverse City where he says I I don't know I think you know I and my father are one Amen to invested here 10 verse 30. amen that's right amen but I'm here now at that day you shall know you know I was looking at this at that level you shall know that I am in my father foreign that's why he was he became a mediator but when the seven seal was opened and revealed to them his people he was no longer a mediated because he was now in them it is coming late you shall know that I am in my father you're in me I in you not Molly you won't come back again to John 14. at that day amen You Phillip Thomas you will never go back to John 14. because the Holy Ghost shall come and you shall know that I am in my father are you spiritual now you are asking me questions but at that day there will be no questions and answers questions and answers amen amen all right then he came back now listen to this really jump now John 14 John 14 verse 20. yeah this is the one verse 20. at that day you shall know Mark said invested into what it says there mark 13 33 Mark chapter 13 verse 32 Heaven and Earth shall pass away but my way shall not pass away but of that day and that hour noeth no man no not the Angels which are in heaven neither the son but the father amen okay amen I'll see you again let's leave it Mark 30. um but it it is but of that day that that amen foreign which which day this this John 14. because Mark 13 but of that day and that hour noeth no man you see that level but you come to John 14. but at that day you shall know I mean you see the difference right amen but Mark 13 but of that day we always know men no not the Angels amen amen because that was not the day the seventh seal was revealed no not the angels of heavens yeah okay I mean but you come down now today is revealed meaning if you say the seven is not revealed then you are still up there you don't know the day they say today we are going to reveal the seventh seeds amen amen you don't when I look at this it was something sort of an anointing approach otherwise you can mix these days but it's not the same day one day that day it is coming yeah but foreign what now it depends one is still venturing in that day where it was not yet made known and the other one is inside where he says that you shall know amen that I am foreign Hallelujah it doesn't be it doesn't say that I believe the father I believe I am in [Music] you know if you are in it's not a matter of saying at that day I believe it's not talking about believing or I believe what is talking about being inside that's why in the book and reading of God he speaks of the foreign in the book um he says the Throne of God can only be seen from the inside amen that's why in the New Jerusalem the body there is the bride of Christ and then top there is late matomo God said let there be light that light has been shining forth throughout the ages amen amen and the children of Abraham were coming because there was light The Shining even today we've got it we're still bringing it the light house Lighthouse where we are going amen now inside now that's why the prophet tells you that light is shining only see my fella the others are not inside they will recite without is that right now but the pride she is The Insider amen [Music] and the top is the throne now he says the throne can only be seen from the inside amen [Applause] foreign fella in the threefold more threefold now if you are part of the threefold it says here it said it really at that day you shall no no no who amen are you looking at the two things the first one says but off that day but this one says that I am in my father where is it amen where is it amen John 14 20. amen at that day you shall know because see that now you listen to tell it uh he is not saying like that day I don't know we will see whether you will come through or whatever now you he's talking to a particular person or to some people over my G at the at that day not off that day you shall know that I am in my father you in me and I in you then he called it three foreign if you are part of this you are a revelation um I I I can read you some things here [Applause] if you are part of that you are a revelation I'm going to repeat to a person in the set and in a threefold here but not you know you can't repeat it to a threefold a person that's part of the threefold God said let there be light I always see it was he supposed to repeat it perhaps like to come and say Lord I didn't hear you can follow you did you say I should come into being or what is because if he speaks that light is a manifestation no light cannot question him and say maybe you did it too early no it's part of him that's all a manifestation all right amen now even with you Lewin Revelation is something you can't say Okay Siri God can can you remind me of the seventh seeds but you know I think you said okay once he speaks the words Isaiah 55 Isaiah 55 listen to him then you know about it yeah this day then you should know 11 okay so shall my weight be that goeth forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me void but it shall accomplish that which I please and it shall prosper in the thing where to I send it okay amen the word that goeth out of my mouth my mouth it shall prosperity amen amen he never said the one who will believe that word will Prosperity no it is the way that prospers in you thank you if God says in Elizabeth or Susan Elizabeth will prosper look prosper amen the work will prosper in you you are just a vessel prosperous did you hear that liquid I'm a let that be light our Valencia and there was light you've never heard the light coming back saying I've been shining throughout the ages because it is him now I'm reading to you something here firstly if you can believe if you've never believed maybe today you can believe the Christ in the church is just being made nowhere I mean this book says book here Christ he request not Jesus it's all Jesus Christ Christ is the mystery of God reveals it's a great it's a great book amen amen wherever I go I always carry this book amen I'm trying to now you know when when we are out there in the field I know the people from whom I can borrow the spoken with yes all right saying they were going for outreach so if you go out to reach oh you will try they leave the spoken right behind and go to the Outreach we have spoken waiting amen but there are some they come with the spoken words today Outreach wherever they are they are part of the world now listen I'm closing now it's just part of the ongoing thing here but firstly you should see it it's two things but of that day end at that day you shall know but of that day that was still coming no no the Angels the day the Revelation is made no the day of the seventh year when it is revealed now here but at that day you shall know amen that I am um did he introduce any college between that saying because said that day you shall know now I must take you through yeah no it's not like that it is foreign [Music] uh it was not only sent to the prophet Affair amen if he says behold I will send unto you he's sending those that message to you but packaged into output change I'm a amen when the package is opened then you see what the Lord has sent to me [Music] is that right now you must keep that package with you until it is the day of the opening all right you know last we have read about this but when I was there just taking a nap it came back say have you considered this it's not one scripture before the sales the Angels do but of that day even the angels don't know that is before the foreign it differently at that day you shall no no no now you know at that day that worry I am in my father and you Lena can you say not me brothers because it says I am in my father and you Lena in me amen no in closing I heard the Revelation that revealed it's in a three four three four okay no I must now stop here for a I can continue we'll see it do you notice on the opening of the seventh seal it's also in threefold let me ask what does it mean it it's in a threefold meaning that if hey you are part of the threefolds only the threefold okay threefold will know about this Revelation amen amen that's why John 14 says the way you know even before they received the Holy Ghost he said amen where I am going you know amen amen didn't he say the same thing to you the way you know the Revelation you know you know what is the seventh sin wow if you don't know you say no it is not revealed yes to you but to the threefold it is revealed the members I believe I'm in the threefold so it drops right in there like in a constellation that's why the prophet uh a state of God saying when a lot of money taking him through some classes he puts him in the constellations when he comes out of the constellation he comes with a message as we take our children to school into that academic course delusion [Music] you expect to help him to come back with something is that right now who's right I mean God also he has to take his children the Prophet The Prophet was put in the in a constellation coming up people still don't believe it but because I'm closing listen you know it is very hard oh we really can't need uh tending in the government what was standing in the gap it has not yet reached the people about that sword and this part that says hearing I was a the the Angels picked me and that angel picked him up you know he says for him to reveal to see these things he was taken away Eastward we like are you sure to reveal he was taken man was placed Eastward movement now that's why at the end they picked him cookie and they were going eastwards now it was coming from the West today because for for him to for Adam to prophesy he has to go Eastward he has to take his position yeah now he says I was brought East to open their seals for God is there any person who has read that but did you see anything there amen I have never never had somebody mentioning that is all right I mean I've never heard somebody mentioning that since I arrived he was taken each one to open seals for God I've never heard any person rather in preaching or just talking it looks like it is untouchable why you say one shall open this is but you forget to come to terms with how Warrior you could say the Lord Morena Jehovah shall come Jehovah and Deliver us out of the bondage right a but the thing is I mean he did it but here comes a man with a stick it seems so something out of place and now they were waiting for Jehovah let my people go some would even say we are not these people foreign when because it was coming and they were waiting for job to deliver them local but it comes amen they have known very well foreign my man my man Moses came amen amen he's Soul so yeah flooded with the word of God Have You Ever Had Moses saying yeah I don't know because there's a target for me then yeah police are looking for me I don't know how I will cope no and Jehovah never said music I'll stand for you for that yeah against that case the Lord says go and deliver my people I mean Lord how about that case now I'm not talking about the case talking about the Deliverance of my people [Applause] come on how he will open okay it is Moses who opened then here to open and he I saw I saw it how he opened amen God can come so close to men until he tells you that I will come to deliver you amen amen he come so close to you that when he comes he's a man you can talk to you amen amen foreign [Applause] let's read the next page God will always use a man and people stumble like that why it should be
