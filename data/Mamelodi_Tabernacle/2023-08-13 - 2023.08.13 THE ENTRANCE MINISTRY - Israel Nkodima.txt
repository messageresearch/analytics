Description:
Title: The Entrance Ministry
Preached by Pastor Israel Nkodima on 13 August 2023 at Mamelodi Tabernacle.

The Pastor reads the following scriptures:

John 14: 20.  II Peter 1: 11  Rev 21: 1 - 3  John 17: 14  Rev 12: 7

Behold the tabernacle God is with Man, is not talking about the physical tabernacle but it means his body. And he will no longer be our father in heaven, because will be here with us. And this is what we are waiting for.

When Jesus came to John, Peter and James he said follow me, and they followed him because it was the voice they heard from the beginning.

God always is specific when he address things. The entire church ages is not the bride, but the bride is the overcomers out of each church age. 

You will love the Lord if you are not of the world. If you are of the world, you will love the world. He said at that day you shall know that I am in you and you in me. We are waiting for him in Christ and not in a church.

The pastor quotes the following books:
65-0720 Christ Is The Mystery.. Par 449
57-1006 Questions and Answers on Hebrews Par 822 - 824

Peter verse 11. for so an entrance shall be ministered unto you abundantly into the Everlasting Kingdom of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen amen our heavenly father here we come again it's another day for your people to come together to worship the almighty God on the first day the Resurrection Day thank you Lord for the songs sung here thank you for your ministers who stood up here to say something and thank you for all the brothers so Brave their way through the service here whether it's his first time because we believe with the predestinated there is no first time they were there before the foundation of the world in Christ Jesus and this is now as the prophet told me that this is the last recovery now the Saints who were with him in his mind are now regathering for a takeoff that's why we know that we are on the wrong way not turning back we have seen the city already the city to come and the prophet also said the pride is like that City so thank you Lord we are waiting for that day when we shall meet in the air amen and shall be with the Lord forever and ever for the new world and the new heaven and the God shall be with us We Shall Behold his face we shall be able to handle him shall be able to greet him like we greet one another here that is the day as I pray for the word we we are just to partake of that you blessed in our hearts in Jesus Christ's name amen yes you may be seated God bless you okay as I promise and okay amen me and my brother maybe we'll take 15 minutes just over 12 because we are supposed to uh come to 12 o'clock God bless you God bless you no one day we were in Swaziland [Music] and uh so something happened that I couldn't apologize for no you know when we read that scripture Revelation chapter 9. 21 or 21 you still remember description read it out to us Revelation 21 from verse 1 to 3. and I saw a new Heaven and a new Earth for the first Heaven and the first Earth were passed away and there was no more sea and I John saw the holy city New Jerusalem coming down from God out of Heaven prepared as a bride adorned for a husband and I had a great voice out of Heaven saying behold the Tabernacle of God is with me and he will dwell with them and they shall be his people and God himself shall be with them and be their God amen amen um every time I read that scripture because he says behold is with me now it's not talking about the Tabernacle the building it's talking about his body shall be with us [Music] and as I say it shall be no no more like today our father no heaven will come down so it won't be our father it will be our father who will be here with us working with us talking with us mouth to mouth so it won't be our father in Heaven it will be our father who is really with us that made me tears ity amen amen this is what we are waiting for I don't know what you are waiting for you know when Jesus came the first thing he did he went around collecting the people we let us Eternal brethren [Music] those who were in him James he said follow me [Music] he didn't struggle to say repentance follow me I live that was enough for Peter John and James they never ask any questions follow you who are you no because that voice came from before the foundation of the world he spoke with them on the foundation of the world you know the summer written women foreign she went around saying repeating one thing I know Messiah now firstly you should understand he says I know whether this gospel preachings about him in particular I I know I know the Rapture is coming amen amen I know yes while she was on the street as a prostitute you see how we just need to bring destination works yet in that woman there was light a little like this and while he was on the street and in her transparent uh budget inside there was that little light now I know the Messiah and when he is he will tell us we all look for a message that could tell us all things we looked for a prophet who could tell us all things amen amen you know the bride of Christ from Miracles and wonders great I see that is in here now just for a few minutes I'm looking at the scripture the entrance shall be ministered he says shall be ministered finish the sentence he shall that an entrance and your abundance yes shall be ministered amen all right amen entrance you know what we call the re entry we came down now we are going back again so that's why Peter says shall be ministered unto you now and I read here you know where it says at that day there is actually you shall know has that the day yet arrived amen because if the Lord says at that day you shall know that day must arise the day of that knowledge the day I know that he is in the father okay we have Grace here until brother what's the type five to five to twelve or five to twelve it was this time ah God bless you sure Grace Grace John 14 14 you are familiar with description at that day Now you listen to a a true prophet of God at that day and that day that is this day because it has happened foreign there's no dispute with that because he's talking to somebody and behold I will send you now if it is you he has promised then you will see that prophet and you believe well you will know when that Prophet arrives profit you see the specifications [Music] where now so if somebody says I don't believe that I don't believe in that but you because he has promised you [Music] [Applause] will accept it it's a personal thing with you Our God likes to be personal a specific okay now you are familiar here that is Christ is the mystery of God revealed Christ is the mystery of God no Christ uh it is it doesn't say Jesus Jesus is his just okay amen amen no it says in Christ now Christ is the anointing [Music] [Applause] okay amen the people but you can believe him as Jesus Christian the name Jesus didn't bother the the people because there was another one Jesus so that name was not a problem [Applause] culture and then it says at that day now it is that's this day now Charlie if it is it says this it is this day it must be referring to somebody who were supposed to receive it that day no the day of that knowledge somebody will know that at this day he says you shall know that I am in the father and the father um now if you put it together it is called a threefold revolution that's why it says [Music] [Music] let me know let's try to say it again if you go back it tells you that it was God logos [Music] that's the report God now the the seventh seals then you come here it says and you in me you in me and I in you that is threefold now if a mystery is revealed and if it says it is that is the three four okay so those that are in him what is the seven things well we'll look at it again one day there was an angel it says an angel with the seventh facilities [Music] foreign you will know that I am in the father and the father in me how many things and I in you amen amen how many things do you see here all right amen for the Bible says greater is he that is in you than that the one that is in there [Music] you know the Bible says uh is this for me brother whoa oh God bless you at least we are receiving Letters From You amen okay when the Revelation at that day is when the Revelation is made known a heart you will know that I am in the father foreign and we shall know that the father is and the Father the oh me and the father are one everybody I am in the father and the father prophet of God here expresses this the Oneness amen [Music] and you are part of the threefold [Applause] amen amen and I am in you and you in me you know amen yeah I am in you you and me see the three the many Falls [Music] Army okay now I will finish with this a lot really I let me quote you something yeah from the book of I book so spoken with the Hebrews it's on page 499 those who have the book which says God was this great Fountain of seven colors how many numbers and how many news that God has seven spirits so it says so in the Bible absolutely seven spirits and there was seven Isis seven spirits coming together now amen amen coming together right now that was God spirits but now now it's coming together you don't see seven spirits like the bride is made of seven churches he has now come together out of each Church age cometh what do we call the Overcomers Buffet the whole church age is not the price the bright is over they overcome out of every church because every Church produce the twins you find yeah all calling ourselves the bride of Christ but look at the nature I was here in Miami the time I was living in Canada and a young woman said to me you also uh people calling yourselves the bride of Christ you are separated [Music] I said we are not talking about the bread we are talking that people calling themselves again the bread of Christ be separated he has one wife [Music] amen amen he says yes [Music] I'm not talking about somebody who has the spoken I'm talking about the bride of Christ amen amen that's that's what I'm talking about I've seen one of yeah there's two sisters they said to me they are from a certain denomination do you know Brothers I said yes they said oh um yeah he is with you oh what foreign [Music] foreign who used to run around amen now they were trying to say something that you see the bride of Christ so I said no the bread of Christ doesn't drink that is the price if you see somebody coming to our church he is a church member who comes no he's not even a member no he's a church [Music] after he has taken a bottle he comes to church no we were surprised when we saw him oh democracy Christian is somebody who is Christ's life Christianity is not a religion amen [Music] religion religion is something about God Christianity [Music] that is a Christian because Christ dwells in that person so don't call anything Christians until you see Christ amen amen then you can say I perceived amen amen amen and uh let me finish now now foreign [Music] amen amen you know even last week we were looking at this the world two different things the Bible says God made the world and the Earth [Music] the f is this music but the world is a system that's why the Bible says love not the things of the world he that loves the things of the world he has not seen God have not seen God amen amen now you have the Warriors is that right amen now and the Bible says you know that scripture brother the world hates me says the Lord he didn't say the Earth is that John 17 where it says the world hates you is it there finding that scripture for him Miss John someway John 17 then 17. for you are not of the world 2017 from this voting I have given them my weight and the world have hated them because they are not of the world even as I am not of the world the world has hated [Applause] even amen amen even as I am not and the world have hated them because they are not of the world even as I am not of the world you love God because he's not of the world and you will only love him when you are also not of the world [Applause] but if you are of the world you hate God foreign because religion is not Christian oh now it says he came into a body you know the Bible says the way it was made [Music] and I was reading where it says although she was a prostitute working around them but yet there was something in here I know Messiah have you seen such a thing somebody going like this on the streets and every moment she will enter I know the Messiah and when he is he will tell us foreign [Music] why they call that belt if yeah a Tracker belt if they maybe they want to study a lion they use that tracker and every time they come to the area and then they put on their receiver what do you call it going around in that area then if they come in the vicinity where the animal maybe would be more a populated what they will start to hear it then they know it is Jesus knew [Music] [Applause] when he arrived there at the sea Africa then he received some lips he knew that Peter John and James they are somewhere here [Applause] [Music] that's why she sent out their disciples [Music] into town and then he remains City [Music] knowing that a woman a Samaritan woman is coming this way amen amen so he separated them he sent out the truth opening the way for the summer written movements and when the Jews went out now if you follow later when the summer written went out the Jews came in amen they saw that woman and ask him a question amen when he came in she came in then he started a conversation she is that Samaritan woman amen amen because you could receive some lips there's somebody predestinated around here foreign [Applause] amen so he came for that amen you know the story is foreign what was left for here [Music] to be made flesh when the weight was made flesh then she said I perceived I perceived you are perfect amen amen and amen people come and see [Applause] and the people foreign but now it looks like she has seen something special because I believe that arriving home she even went to borrow some a schedule amen amen and something you know that was not because she had the things you look at the mercy of God I mean Anthony when the Lord arrives she ended up saying I believe that you are a prophet away okay let me finish this now do you find me you're funny when you are looking because we are looking at the the entrance Ministry [Music] we are not talking about the what they call this gospel for money and prosperity prosperity the Bible says [Music] um tell me if you want something from God what do you do I mean ask and it shall be given unto you didn't say still ask unto you foreign [Music] oral but today if instead of asking they gave they go for money rituals killing children today killing even adults foreign [Music] you know that day Revelation chapter 10. that's chapter 7 chapter 7 is it verse 10. yes yeah that's true therefore rejoice in heaven and he that dwell in them who to the inhabitors of the earth and of the sea for the Devil is come down unto you having great breath because he knoweth that he had but a short time if there's somebody worried today is the devil [Music] don't know that the time is short but satanism he knows that what the time is [Music] and that's why you see what she is okay but let me finish yeah please when you are looking at that here we live that is a man [Music] that's why I knew that yeah preaching um this now usually is the ministry is as we read out here the entrance shall be minister [Music] unto you now we are ministering unto you [Music] [Applause] it's re-entry going back that's the ministry today but only for the bride because if you preach this is a bright nose already this the sign is there already is ready to enter [Music] you asked me where is the bride is in Christ [Music] but there's a day that is coming and he will come he won't even set his foot right he will come in the end that's where we look for him you know sometimes walking alone [Laughter] you will find my eyes [Applause] yes he has promised that he will meet me that's my expectation and he has promised you you know where to wait for the plane to Malawi is I don't just wait anywhere that's right I know the place the one who is coming is coming in there I don't wait for him in a church [Music] I wait for him in Christ because he said that day you shall know that I am in you do you know whatever now because he says you shall know now listen uh the thing is all these things are coming together now the Father the logos coming together now in a free-fold that's why we were reading last time that is the only way to know him is to receive a three-fold revelation outside of that I don't know I all know when I am part of him I don't you can't hear somebody saying I don't know whether I'm a part of this family foreign I worship the one I know that's why if you worship him he gives you an his divine nature so you worship him um Peter says he has given us a divine nature he doesn't tame us he changed us [Applause] amen amen foreign [Music] oh but a Christian it's a different person you find a Money Lover he will kill you don't think just
