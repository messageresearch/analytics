[29:35] uh
[29:38] it leaves us with one hour or less
[29:44] awara
[29:47] now it says
[29:51] that scripture again
[29:55] this is 14. yes sir
[29:58] from Verse 18
[30:01] said the king of Salem brought forth
[30:04] Bread and Wine and he was the priest of
[30:07] the most high God and he blessed him and
[30:10] said Blessed Be Abram of the most high
[30:13] god possessor of Heaven and Earth and he
[30:16] blessed and blessed be the most high God
[30:20] which has delivered thine enemies into
[30:22] thy hand and he gave him tithes of all
[30:26] okay amen
[30:28] amen
[30:32] you know last week how we went through
[30:36] it
[30:42] Melchizedek foreign
[30:46] Abraham
[30:48] part of himself
[30:55] that's why the Lord said
[30:57] that day you shall know that I am in you
[31:03] I have given you part of me
[31:08] oh isn't that great
[31:12] the Creator
[31:20] amen amen you know we are not just a
[31:24] creation like flowers and I don't know
[31:27] about it
[31:32] when it was announced it said
[31:36] and let us make men in our image
[31:44] now he wanted this image also to be part
[31:49] of the spirit
[31:55] we saw you were supposed to walk like
[31:58] him yeah
[32:05] [Music]
[32:07] In His Image
[32:10] amen amen and then
[32:15] because there's only
[32:17] two images
[32:29] is also an image
[32:36] when we were Sinners
[32:42] the Lord Morena
[32:46] started to rewind
[32:49] and uh
[32:53] to keep his own words
[32:57] let us make men in our image no
[33:05] the first
[33:06] son in human race
[33:11] [Music]
[33:14] forfeited the book
[33:18] because after he made amen
[33:22] he even
[33:24] gave him the book
[33:28] the title is
[33:31] because he shared with him
[33:34] a part of Eden
[33:41] uh
[33:43] he yeah
[33:45] God himself was the god of Eden
[33:52] but he made his son the god of the Earth
[34:00] that's why you have Eden
[34:03] and the garden of Egypt
[34:08] is
[34:16] The Garden of God
[34:20] now
[34:22] he put his son is
[34:41] foreign
[34:58] all right amen now let's look at this
[35:02] now
[35:05] what was given to Adam was attacking
[35:09] Jesus
[35:13] all right amen well the title did
[35:17] meaning that yeah
[35:21] the Garden of Eden is under your control
[35:31] uh what you say there it shall be done
[35:36] what you put they shall remain
[35:40] what you plant there shall remain
[35:46] I've given you the authority
[35:50] the deed fulfill it
[35:53] together
[35:56] but fella
[35:59] foreign
[36:10] because that was the book of
[36:13] secrets
[36:18] the book of mysteries
[36:23] so when Adam dropped it yeah
[36:32] it was for Saturn Satan
[36:37] not to see the secrets between this God
[36:41] and this manner
[36:49] amen amen
[36:50] and then what happened later
[36:57] that that that title did yeah it's
[37:01] called them the book of redemption
[37:08] God knew that uh
[37:14] he would need that
[37:16] Redemption book
[37:17] um
[37:20] yeah
[37:28] so when Adam fulfated
[37:32] God took it
[37:35] it was not for Satan to see the
[37:37] secretary
[37:41] amen amen even now that's why the
[37:44] seventh seals
[37:48] Satan don't understand it how
[37:53] he doesn't understand
[37:56] because it's a secret between amen the
[38:00] Creator
[38:02] the god of Heaven amen and the mind of
[38:06] God
[38:13] now Julie
[38:16] there he took it I see the original
[38:20] um
[38:24] now that's why now Revelation chapter
[38:27] five we
[38:35] then what happened later
[38:39] with the book
[38:42] because this is the book of redemption
[38:45] our names
[38:49] our destiny
[38:52] our destination
[38:58] what it says Revelation chapter 5 verse
[39:02] one to seven amen
[39:04] and I saw in the right hand of him that
[39:07] said on the throne a book written within
[39:10] and on the back side sealed with Seven
[39:13] Seals and I saw a strong angel
[39:16] proclaiming with a loud voice who is
[39:18] worthy to open the book and to lose the
[39:21] souls thereof and no man in Heaven Nor
[39:24] in Earth neither under the Earth was
[39:27] able to open the book neither to look
[39:30] there on and I wept much because no man
[39:33] was found with to open and to read the
[39:36] book neither to look there on okay amen
[39:41] uh I saw
[39:46] continue I saw in the right hand in the
[39:49] right hand
[39:52] on the throne
[39:54] says
[39:59] all right and that is in the right hand
[40:03] because
[40:06] uh you'll realize
[40:09] if you look to the right hand
[40:14] even Jesus himself
[40:18] come around
[40:20] he has won the battle Avengers the Bible
[40:23] says then he sat on the right hand of
[40:26] the message
[40:26] [Music]
[40:30] people
[40:37] that's why now
[40:42] is
[40:48] foreign
[41:04] [Music]
[41:17] there was an angel
[41:25] so it came right down
[41:37] amen amen to the right hand people
[41:44] a job knew about it
[41:48] he said
[41:50] he works
[41:58] but hide himself
[42:04] little
[42:12] bit
[42:19] I want to talk
[42:22] but the right hands
[42:27] Jesus Christ
[42:40] so remain on the right yeah
[42:45] okay amen now Jordan and uh in this book
[42:50] yeah that's why uh
[42:55] when the book
[42:57] was closed there was no Jubilee amen
[43:04] that's why the Jubilee started
[43:30] okay
[44:04] I remember a
[44:07] there in mabubani yeah
[44:20] it was a certain family that I know very
[44:24] well
[44:27] the sum of
[44:30] the relatives
[44:37] they would also come and stay in that
[44:40] house
[44:41] and now one of the
[44:44] because Bob and they were just relatives
[44:48] but there was a song
[44:53] as I believe the parents had passed on
[44:58] yeah
[45:06] but others like Uncle yeah
[45:10] they also
[45:19] for me
[45:22] then they'll do whatever they wanted
[45:26] some coming in
[45:33] now the sun
[45:35] went to the uh
[45:39] offices
