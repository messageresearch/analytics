[2:10:43] Okay. Amen. He says,
[2:10:48] "And brother, amen. Are you sure?"
[2:10:51] That's why the part I was reading. Okay.
[2:10:55] Has been opened.
[2:10:57] All right. He say the sixth seal is
[2:11:01] being
[2:11:02] opened to
[2:11:04] us. We see
[2:11:06] it. We know
[2:11:10] that this seventh se
[2:11:14] cannot be opened or
[2:11:17] broke to the public.
[2:11:21] Now realize that there is
[2:11:26] public and queen the
[2:11:30] price. He says until that
[2:11:34] hour this
[2:11:36] seal being open to
[2:11:40] us and we know that the
[2:11:44] seventh seal cannot be broke to the
[2:11:49] public.
[2:11:52] It's a special
[2:11:54] one. It's not for the
[2:11:57] public. Okay. Amen.
[2:12:00] Then I come to
[2:12:04] this. We
[2:12:06] have in the complexion here now by the
[2:12:11] grace of
[2:12:12] God all the mysteries of the six
[2:12:17] seals that's been sealed
[2:12:20] up. We understand it. And
[2:12:25] now they
[2:12:26] that they that okay now here that the
[2:12:32] seventh
[2:12:34] seal is not known to the
[2:12:39] public. So the
[2:12:43] sixth it is also open to the bride. The
[2:12:47] bride knows about the
[2:12:50] s but the
[2:12:52] servant is only known by the bride
[2:12:58] [Applause]
[2:12:59] not not by the church by the by the
[2:13:03] bride.
[2:13:05] Okay. Now then you will know
[2:13:10] that when
[2:13:13] we speak or talk about the
[2:13:18] seventh, we are only talking to the
[2:13:23] bride, not to
[2:13:27] everybody. Because
[2:13:30] everybody it says there is this the
[2:13:34] public
[2:13:36] and the
[2:13:37] bride. Now what is revealed to the
[2:13:41] bride is not known to the
[2:13:46] public. Just as we are like this this
[2:13:49] morning, you
[2:13:51] are member of the
[2:13:55] bride then you are blessed.
[2:13:58] [Applause]
[2:14:01] Amen. So I read is the prophet talking
[2:14:06] here
[2:14:09] and
[2:14:11] 103 seals. 103 seals. I don't know if I
[2:14:16] have it quickly here with me. Amen. 103.
[2:14:19] If somebody has
[2:14:21] it, if somebody has it
[2:14:24] 103 103 paragraph 255.
[2:14:28] Paragraph 255. Amen.
[2:14:32] Yes, I have it here. All right. Amen.
[2:14:34] God bless you. Amen. Yeah. It says
[2:14:37] again, "But now he comes from here at
[2:14:40] this last seat. He is no more a
[2:14:43] mediator." Yeah. Stop a bit there. Amen.
[2:14:47] You know what is a mediator?
[2:14:50] Somebody standing for
[2:14:52] you. And should you lose a
[2:14:56] mediator, there's no one to stand for
[2:14:58] you.
[2:15:01] So this is what it says here.
[2:15:04] Amen. Amen. He is no more a mediator. A
[2:15:08] mediator.
[2:15:10] When?
[2:15:12] Now. Read it. It says, "But now he comes
[2:15:16] from here at this last se, the seventh
[2:15:19] seal.
[2:15:21] Right. He is no more a mediator. He is
[2:15:25] king." Now
[2:15:27] when he hits the
[2:15:30] seven, he is no
[2:15:33] more.
[2:15:35] Amen. I I have heard many people saying
[2:15:39] the seventh seal is not
[2:15:41] revealed. Meaning they don't have a
[2:15:48] meaning. Amen. Amen.
[2:15:55] Read that, brother. It says, "But now he
[2:15:58] comes from here at this last sea, the
[2:16:01] seventh."
[2:16:02] Mhm. He is no more a mediator. Right.
[2:16:06] Amen. He is no more. He is now. He is
[2:16:11] now a king now. Right. Amen. There's
[2:16:14] many uh scriptures
[2:16:17] talking about the same thing.
[2:16:20] is no longer a mediator.
[2:16:24] He is now to to
[2:16:27] those seven seal is not
[2:16:30] revealed. He is not their
[2:16:35] king. He he is a
[2:16:38] king to which
[2:16:40] ones the bride to to whom the seven seal
[2:16:45] is revealed.
[2:16:49] this he is a
[2:16:51] king. Now as you we you are
[2:16:56] the sons of
[2:16:59] Abraham Abraham.
[2:17:02] What did that scripture say about
[2:17:04] Abraham?
[2:17:06] It
[2:17:07] says, "And Mechisedc, king of Salem,
[2:17:10] brought forth bread and wine, and he was
[2:17:13] the priest of the most high God, and he
[2:17:16] blessed him and said, blessed be Abraham
[2:17:18] of the most high God, possessor of
[2:17:21] heaven and earth." Right? Amen. Meaning
[2:17:25] he came to Abraham,
[2:17:29] not at that time is not to the
[2:17:32] world, it's to Abraham.
[2:17:36] Abraham. Amen. As a king.
[2:17:40] [Music]
[2:17:42] Okay. Amen. Now, one part the same uh
[2:17:47] page
[2:17:49] here 574 574 paragraph 397. Paragraph
[2:17:56] 397.
[2:17:58] Now that the seventh seal is not to the
[2:18:03] public, it's not known to the
[2:18:09] public. Now it is telling you that there
[2:18:12] is a
[2:18:14] public and the bride. The
[2:18:18] bride. Now there's special message for
[2:18:21] the
[2:18:23] bride which is not to the
[2:18:28] public. The public can
[2:18:31] sit together with the bride and they are
[2:18:36] unable to know what the bride is
[2:18:41] receiving. Amen. Amen. If the if the
[2:18:45] bride received
[2:18:48] him as a king, they
[2:18:53] can't. Hallelujah. All right. Amen.
[2:18:57] Amen. We are talking about
[2:19:00] something. And now here that the seventh
[2:19:04] seal is not to be
[2:19:08] known to the public.
[2:19:12] You have the bride and the
[2:19:15] puppet. But when he reveals the seventh
[2:19:20] seal, it's only to the
[2:19:24] bride. How many
[2:19:27] times have you have you
[2:19:30] heard some people saying the seven seal
[2:19:33] is not
[2:19:35] revealed? That is the
[2:19:38] public. Amen.
[2:19:41] It
[2:19:42] depends. If you you you are saying to
[2:19:47] us the seventh is not revealed you
[2:19:55] are. Amen. I think now you
[2:19:59] understand. Uh now page
[2:20:04] 574 574
[2:20:07] paragraph 3 93. uh paragraph
[2:20:11] 393 uh it says the sixth seal has been
[2:20:15] opened to us. We see it and we know that

[2:20:45] seventh seal cannot be broke to the
[2:20:48] public. That's right. Amen. It's us and
[2:20:52] the public.
[2:20:55] Now, we know he says it is open to
[2:21:00] us. And we
[2:21:03] know because if it is not open to
[2:21:08] you, God says you are a public.
[2:21:16] Now you should know from
[2:21:18] today and you want to engage yourself in
[2:21:23] a public and a
[2:21:26] bright arguments arguments.

[2:21:42] public. Amen.
[2:21:46] Now
[2:21:47] uh
[2:21:49] page two2
[2:21:53] where it says he is no more
[2:21:58] a
[2:22:03] mediator maybe read it from the book. uh
[2:22:07] 122 paragraph 51 51
[2:22:12] it

[2:22:18] when the real revelation happens on the
[2:22:21] se as they begin to break the lamp is

[2:22:27] according to the word we read it we read
[2:22:30] it last night he come from there out of
[2:22:33] the midst of the book and took the book.
[2:22:37] So he is no more a mediator because even

[2:22:45] is not a mediator then. Okay. Amen.
[2:22:50] I think you are we are together

[2:25:24] paragraph 51 51 Amen.
[2:25:28] Okay. says he come from there out of the
[2:25:33] mist and took the book. So he is no more
[2:25:37] a mediator because even they call him a
[2:25:41] lion and that's that's the king and he
[2:25:45] is not a mediator
[2:25:48] then because he has the book
[2:25:53] he took the
[2:25:54] book but
[2:25:57] what did he do with the book?
[2:26:01] He came down with the book. He came down
[2:26:04] to the book with the
[2:26:06] book and now the book according to the
[2:26:10] word of the prophet is with the bride.

[2:27:31] engaged in
[2:27:33] arguments. Some saying it is another one
[2:27:37] is not the bride is not in that
[2:27:41] argument because they know who they
[2:27:46] are. That's right.
[2:27:49] And then now you know there was I was
[2:27:53] this morning I was looking at something
[2:27:58] you know
[2:27:59] even uh I was with the

[2:29:48] one. Which pyramid? Pyramid
[2:29:50] number of Enoy.

[2:30:08] says found these
[2:30:10] stones shaped already for the pyramid.
[2:30:15] [Applause]

[2:30:22] already for him.

[2:31:39] pyramid and we are not talking about
[2:31:43] something we that is only readable.
[2:31:48] But these
[2:31:50] are
[2:31:53] now if I say you are in the
[2:31:58] pyramid. If you say amen, that would
[2:32:01] mean you are in the

[2:35:41] No, the answer was in
[2:35:46] Peter. That's why he didn't go
[2:35:51] around. What can the answer
[2:35:55] be? No. Peter just said, "Thou art the
[2:36:00] Christ.
[2:36:03] Son of the living God.

[2:36:30] he said to him, "Thou art
[2:36:32] Peter," everybody could say, "Yeah,
[2:36:38] yeah." But when he said, "Upon this
[2:36:43] rock," some were
[2:36:46] [Applause]

[2:37:27] He wanted to share with a man.
[2:37:33] He is the rock of ages.
[2:37:38] But he said to Peter, "Thou art."
[2:37:44] And he came in the form of a
[2:37:48] man to build his
[2:37:51] church upon a form of a man.
[2:37:57] So he wanted somebody with the name
[2:38:00] little
[2:38:02] stone because Peter
[2:38:06] means little stone. Little
[2:38:11] stone. So among those he has
[2:38:15] chosen he was looking for
[2:38:18] somebody with this
[2:38:21] name. Little stone. Little stone.
[2:38:25] Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. Then when he
[2:38:27] found Peter, he
[2:38:30] said upon this
[2:38:34] rock
[2:38:36] because you know even the pyramid
[2:38:41] pyramid there's a
[2:38:43] stone, white stone. We are not through
[2:38:47] with that. The white throne. the white
[2:38:51] root
[2:38:52] stone in the
[2:38:56] pyramid we we will still come with
[2:39:00] that even here there's part of it here
[2:39:06] where it says
[2:39:08] the third that means the third came from
[2:39:14] the
[2:39:19] west Um do you know that scripture in
[2:39:22] Genesis 2?
[2:39:26] It
[2:39:27] says verse 8 I think you know or just
[2:39:30] read it a
[2:39:33] bit Genesis 2:8 and the Lord God planted
[2:39:37] a garden eastward in Eden and there he
[2:39:40] put the man whom he had formed. Right.
[2:39:44] Amen. Man was put east what? Eastward.
[2:39:51] Then
[2:39:55] later this the Lord Jesus said it it
[2:39:59] says he went
[2:40:04] west men was eastward
[2:40:08] eastward but to connect with the
[2:40:11] angels he went
[2:40:14] eastward westward.
[2:40:16] You know we have read it many
[2:40:19] time. Amen. Amen. To
[2:40:23] connect with the angels
[2:40:27] message. Then he came back.
[2:40:32] Yes. Amen. We'll talk about east and
[2:40:37] west. Amen. Man was east.
[2:40:42] Eastward. and you go west,
[2:40:45] it's angels,
[2:40:50] you'll see it even here when when he met
[2:40:53] with the angels.
[2:40:56] Amen. He said, I met he met the
[2:41:00] angels, flying
[2:41:04] angels. Amen. I can I can let me look at
[2:41:08] something here. Amen. you know,
[2:41:13] uh, page 576,
[2:41:17] 576,
[2:41:22] he speaks of a notable
[2:41:29] angel. The angel was very notable to
[2:41:35] me. Then he says, the rest of them
[2:41:40] just seemed
[2:41:44] ordinary. But this
[2:41:47] angel, he's talking about the notable
[2:41:50] one was noted
[2:41:55] angel. He was to my
[2:41:58] left in the
[2:41:59] constellation in the form of a
[2:42:03] pyramid. So these are angels. Now
[2:42:08] you have a you have a pyramidal pyramid
[2:42:11] of
[2:42:13] stone. Tell me about this pyramids.
[2:42:17] Another pyramids.
[2:42:19] Pyramid of stones. There's a time when
[2:42:22] it is a pyramid of
[2:42:25] stone and the next thing is a pyramid of
[2:42:28] angels.
[2:42:30] Angels. Lord.
[2:42:33] Another time is
[2:42:38] the other time is the bed. Amen. Things
[2:42:41] like this.
[2:42:43] He typed these things.
[2:42:47] Now he speaks of an angel that was
[2:42:52] notable to
[2:42:54] him. The rest of them just seemed
[2:42:59] ordinary. But this one
[2:43:04] as
[2:43:05] Peter had a stone
[2:43:09] you also there's something in you.
[2:43:14] Amen. Amen. The message you have
[2:43:18] received it is something in
[2:43:22] you like with brother
[2:43:27] here. What was it?
[2:43:30] the engine. All right, let me let me
[2:43:32] read. Yes. Amen. Then sometimes
[2:43:38] he refers to him as the angel with the
[2:43:42] seventh
[2:43:47] seal. That's where now the
[2:43:52] people need an
[2:43:57] esproad. Yes.
[2:44:00] Yeah, you know to us it it it is in the
[2:44:06] heart because if it is not in the
[2:44:10] heart and uh it happen to be in the
[2:44:15] head then that's where you find a
[2:44:21] denomination the way if it is in the
[2:44:25] head it's a denomination. Amen.
[2:44:30] All right. Amen. But if brother Brennham
[2:44:33] says I went
[2:44:36] westward because man was placed
[2:44:39] west east.
[2:44:42] Yes. Now to go
[2:44:46] west it
[2:44:51] says Genesis 2 chapter 2 verse 8. Okay.
[2:44:57] Uh uh uh yeah. And the Lord God planted
[2:45:00] a garden eastward in Eden and there he
[2:45:04] put the man whom he had formed. Amen.
[2:45:07] Where? Eastward. Eastward.
[2:45:11] So that's why he says I went
[2:45:16] westward to connect with the angel's
[2:45:19] message
[2:45:23] because men was pleased.
[2:45:27] Now to meet the angel he says I went
[2:45:32] west to meet
[2:45:35] with the
[2:45:37] angel even it is like that we'll see it
[2:45:42] where he talks about east to
[2:45:44] west and the prophet says east and west
[2:45:50] [Applause]
[2:45:54] that's why
[2:45:56] Now the east the angel
[2:46:01] you know that's why the
[2:46:03] message you have let me finish it
[2:46:09] here the angel
[2:46:12] another thing I want you to notice
[2:46:16] that's taken place and if you are listen
[2:46:19] to the
[2:46:21] tables says what it
[2:46:24] You will notice that the angel was
[2:46:30] notable to me. I'll tell you that you
[2:46:33] know yourself. You know that there is
[2:46:36] something with
[2:46:38] you which is not
[2:46:42] human. Uhhuh. Amen. And uh you know I
[2:46:46] was talking with the brother he's
[2:46:50] uh we were looking reading about the
[2:46:54] what's taking place now.
[2:46:59] Uh God is talking to
[2:47:02] us
[2:47:04] from before the creation.
[2:47:09] [Applause]
[2:47:10] Amen. Amen.
[2:47:12] And he is even
[2:47:15] showing until it comes to the
[2:47:19] rings. And it shows back
[2:47:24] there
[2:47:25] coming rings after rings and so forth
[2:47:30] until
[2:47:31] Jerusalem the
[2:47:33] city coming up like that. Now he showed
[2:47:37] the
[2:47:38] rings showing that it is the
[2:47:42] end. There is a new city
[2:47:46] coming. Now that's why God wants me to
[2:47:50] say bye-bye
[2:47:53] to because there's coming a new
[2:47:57] Jerusalem. Now this new
[2:47:59] Jerusalem, there's a king.
[2:48:04] All right. Amen. And
[2:48:07] now it is a king and subject subject.
[2:48:14] Now the bride of Christ is the
[2:48:19] subject of the
[2:48:22] king. All right. Amen. Now a
[2:48:25] subject was
[2:48:27] taught led by
[2:48:30] God and a subject knows the
[2:48:35] king and they know a subject knows the
[2:48:43] law. Amen. Amen. All right. We'll come
[2:48:46] to that. Let's let's look at this.
[2:48:50] Uh notice that one
[2:48:53] angel was very notable to
[2:48:57] me. The rest of them just was seemed
[2:49:01] ordinary.
[2:49:04] Amen.
[2:49:10] H there is this one notable to
[2:49:17] us. The rest of
[2:49:22] them, rest of the pastors, rest of
[2:49:25] the churches,
[2:49:32] ordinary. Now that's why you can't go
[2:49:36] and worship in an ordinary church.
[2:49:44] Peter
[2:49:46] knew the notable one.
[2:49:51] But only Peter knew
[2:49:55] and the Lord Jesus
[2:49:57] Christ also Peter was notable to the
[2:50:04] Lord. That's why among all of
[2:50:07] them he said who do men say I the son of
[2:50:10] man
[2:50:13] am you
[2:50:15] see they said some say that
[2:50:18] Some say this, some just like today.
[2:50:23] Then he said, "And
[2:50:26] now who do you
[2:50:28] say that I, the son of son of man
[2:50:35] am?" Now you can say, "I know you are
[2:50:38] the son of man." And you will
[2:50:42] say, "Whoa,
[2:50:45] do you
[2:50:46] say that I the son of man am?
[2:50:54] Amen. Amen. So they just look around
[2:50:58] like that
[2:51:00] and Peter said, "Thou
[2:51:03] art son of the living God."
[2:51:08] I don't know if the Lord Jesus had.
[2:51:16] Amen. Amen.
[2:51:18] And Peter knew something.
[2:51:22] He He couldn't just call him
[2:51:26] anything, but he says, "Thou art the
[2:51:31] Christ." The Christ.
[2:51:35] He didn't say, "Thou art Jesus."
[2:51:40] Amen. Amen. You You must read between
[2:51:43] the
[2:51:46] lines. Who do men say that I am?
[2:51:52] Some say, some say, some say he was
[2:51:57] called by many type of types of
[2:52:02] names. Now he was looking for
[2:52:06] one who knew
[2:52:09] him. The one
[2:52:11] who
[2:52:13] say the right
[2:52:16] thing, who called the right name,
[2:52:21] who do men?
[2:52:25] Amen. Amen.
[2:52:27] And Pet is it Peter? Yes. Who said some
[2:52:31] say this, some say that? Amen. Amen.
[2:52:35] Amen.
[2:52:37] and until he said, "Who do
[2:52:42] you
[2:52:52] say?" Who believes that the seventh seal
[2:52:55] is revealed.
[2:52:58] And what do people say? It's
[2:53:02] not allowed.
[2:53:04] But you say
[2:53:07] it is revealed. Right. Amen.
[2:53:11] Now you that say it is revealed.
[2:53:16] Amen.
[2:53:18] Uh you can you are you are not an answer
[2:53:24] to the one who says
[2:53:27] it is not allowed to do.
[2:53:31] Amen. Amen.
[2:53:33] Don't you say don't say
[2:53:36] that I will keep on praying for
[2:53:39] him until it is revealed to me.
[2:53:45] No, thou art
[2:53:47] Peter. It was not through a
[2:53:50] prayer. It is through predestination.
[2:53:54] [Applause]
[2:53:58] The Lord never said
[2:54:01] and Peter never
[2:54:04] said, "Lord, let me pray
[2:54:08] first so that I can give you the answer
[2:54:11] that I
[2:54:13] know." But who do you
[2:54:16] say I the son of man
[2:54:21] am? There was not no meeting held.
[2:54:26] maybe coming together
[2:54:29] saying what what can we say? He wants
[2:54:32] the answer. He wants an answer.
[2:54:37] It came
[2:54:39] straight from Peter before he was
[2:54:45] born. Amen. be before he was in the
[2:54:49] human
[2:54:51] body, the answer came thou art the
[2:54:57] Christ because Christ is something that
[2:54:59] is not
[2:55:02] visible. Amen. Amen. Now because Peter
[2:55:07] predestinated by God that
[2:55:10] name was in Peter.
[2:55:14] The message that you you
[2:55:17] believe you came with that
[2:55:21] message. That message was already in
[2:55:26] you. And when it was preached to
[2:55:30] you, you said amen.
[2:55:34] It's not from Bible school.
[2:55:37] It is with
[2:55:38] you from before the foundation of God.
[2:55:44] Amen. Amen. And Christ knew
[2:55:51] that I am
[2:55:53] standing with the
[2:55:56] people who came from where I came.
[2:56:01] They should know me.
[2:56:03] [Applause]
[2:56:05] Amen. Now he didn't say
[2:56:09] who do Balana say that I am the
[2:56:12] Pentecostal sing the church the church.
[2:56:17] He said, "Who do you
[2:56:25] Are you listening as I'm closing? Who
[2:56:27] who do you?"
[2:56:29] He was talking to a being that was there
[2:56:34] with
[2:56:36] him. He could not know him
[2:56:39] here after his
[2:56:42] birth. No.
[2:56:46] Amen. That's why he
[2:56:49] started saying who do men.
[2:56:56] Amen. Amen. Some
[2:57:01] said now in his
[2:57:05] mind he
[2:57:07] had some
[2:57:10] people I mean in his
[2:57:12] heart. Amen. But the
[2:57:15] question was to the public. I mean it
[2:57:19] reach even the
[2:57:22] public who do men say yes.
[2:57:27] He didn't
[2:57:30] say what does the bread
[2:57:33] say I am. No it can it cannot come that
[2:57:37] way. But who do
[2:57:42] men now Peter
[2:57:45] you know the
[2:57:47] stone the the message
[2:57:49] always is coming from the
[2:57:54] stone. Amen. Who do men say I the son of
[2:58:00] man.
[2:58:02] Amen.
[2:58:05] Now,
[2:58:07] Peter didn't say it from here.
[2:58:12] No.
[2:58:14] If
[2:58:15] then he ever tried to say it from
[2:58:19] here, it wouldn't
[2:58:22] work. Amen. The Lord Jesus asked this
[2:58:27] question knowing that the the answer is
[2:58:31] here.
[2:58:32] [Applause]
[2:58:36] Peter is
[2:58:37] here. He is the answer. So that's why he
[2:58:41] says,
[2:58:44] but who do you
[2:58:47] say? The people say who do you say that
[2:58:52] I
[2:58:54] am? The same question. We have questions
[2:58:57] here.
[2:58:58] But one
[2:58:59] question will come from
[2:59:04] heaven.
[2:59:05] [Music]
[2:59:08] But an answer from the
[2:59:11] world, it will always be
[2:59:16] contrary. If the question is
[2:59:19] asked by the one who came from
[2:59:23] heaven, it will only
[2:59:26] answered by the one who came.
[2:59:29] [Music]
[2:59:30] [Applause]
[2:59:33] Not just a man
[2:59:36] born here in 1936.
[2:59:44] No coming to the end here.
[2:59:49] Now we read this is very important.
[2:59:55] Uh let's read maybe the last one here
[2:59:59] that is uh page 122. Page 122. It
[3:00:06] is the same about the mediator.
[3:00:11] Yes. Paragraph 51. He come
[3:00:15] from out of the midst and took the book.
[3:00:20] So he is no more a mediator.
[3:00:23] Pardon sir. Pardon me, sir.
[3:00:25] [Music]
[3:00:28] Uh, okay. Yes, you are right. Yes. Read
[3:00:32] please. Is this page 122? Yes. Paragraph
[3:00:37] 51. Amen. Okay. He come from out of the
[3:00:40] midst and took the book. So he is no
[3:00:43] more a mediator because because even
[3:00:46] they call him a lion. That's the king.
[3:00:50] And he is not a mediator there. M amen.
[3:00:55] Now this book
[3:00:58] was returned
[3:01:01] to men.
[3:01:05] You know
[3:01:06] that and
[3:01:09] because there was a Peter among
[3:01:13] them
[3:01:15] meaning Peter
[3:01:17] what little stone little stone.
[3:01:21] Yes. Amen. The Lord made sure
[3:01:24] that when he was calling them one by
[3:01:28] one there should be a
[3:01:32] sto that's why
[3:01:35] Peter
[3:01:37] was the
[3:01:42] one chosen amongst them.
[3:01:48] pyramid. Pyramid. There was a
[3:01:52] stone in the pyramid.
[3:01:55] Now man is also made like a
[3:01:59] pyramid. Amen.
[3:02:02] If there's nothing in you,
[3:02:05] there won't be anything.
[3:02:10] Because as I'm closing
[3:02:13] here, there was a stone in the
[3:02:16] pyramid and a stone in a man.
[3:02:21] Now in order to occupy a
[3:02:26] pyramid, Peter had a
[3:02:30] stone. That's why the Lord said
[3:02:34] upon this
[3:02:36] stone, I'll build my
[3:02:40] church. Amen. Amen.
[3:02:43] He he he he he has chosen the right
[3:02:48] material upon this
[3:02:51] stone upon this
[3:02:53] rock I will build my
[3:02:58] church because I am the rock
[3:03:03] of Amen. Amen. Rock upon
[3:03:07] rock. That's why it is
[3:03:11] impossible to h for us to fail.
[3:03:20] Amen. Are you are you falling?
[3:03:27] If you are built upon a stone,
[3:03:31] then that means you are a
[3:03:37] a rock of
[3:03:42] ages. As I said, I was talking to a
[3:03:47] brother in Malawi.
[3:03:50] We were walking alongside the lake
[3:03:54] lake and there was a a b what do you
[3:03:57] call it? Boulders
[3:03:59] live a huge rock.
[3:04:03] Now I said to the young man who was
[3:04:05] talking my friend. Do you see this
[3:04:09] boulder
[3:04:10] here? You see this rock? He says yes.
[3:04:15] Can you tell me
[3:04:18] how old is this rock?
[3:04:22] He says,
[3:04:24] "No, I said
[3:04:26] now before this rock
[3:04:30] existed, there was supposed to be a rock
[3:04:34] of
[3:04:36] ages." Amen. Amen. That's why we
[3:04:40] sing Rock of Ages. Rock of Ages left for
[3:04:45] me. You know at left
[3:04:48] meaning come
[3:04:50] rain come
[3:04:52] what you are under the
[3:04:56] cliff of the
[3:04:59] rock. How many times have you
[3:05:04] like had a
[3:05:08] dream that maybe one
[3:05:12] day if maybe turmoil come
[3:05:17] or no no no no. We are not talking about
[3:05:21] the coming turmoil.
[3:05:25] We are talking about the coming eternal
[3:05:30] one.
[3:05:34] If then what you are waiting or waiting
[3:05:37] for is
[3:05:41] eternal that that means you are
[3:05:46] eternal. Amen. Because
[3:05:51] even being eternal,
[3:05:55] your mind is
[3:05:57] eternal. Your your your the spirit in
[3:06:00] you
[3:06:03] is all right. Amen.
[3:06:06] Now, that's
[3:06:08] why there's nothing I can
[3:06:12] choose beside the one who is eternal.
[3:06:17] Now if I am not
[3:06:19] eternal, I cannot choose an eternal
[3:06:24] one. Are you
[3:06:27] there? Sometimes you hear they say so
[3:06:31] and
[3:06:32] so so and
[3:06:34] so is no longer coming to
[3:06:37] church. Why? No, he is griefed. Somebody
[3:06:41] said this this about he is not eternal.
[3:06:46] You can never grieve an
[3:06:49] eternal
[3:06:51] [Applause]
[3:06:52] soul. He is eternal.
[3:06:58] The Lord Jesus was
[3:07:00] crucified, done everything.
[3:07:04] Amen. Amen. But he remained eternal.
[3:07:11] A person who has eternal life, you can
[3:07:14] never grieve
[3:07:17] him forever and rever
[3:07:19] and why?
[3:07:21] Because he is
[3:07:24] looking
[3:07:26] not he doesn't dream of
[3:07:31] failing.
[3:07:35] Amen. I say I don't know.
[3:07:39] I'll just see where God leads me. He has
[3:07:42] already told
[3:07:48] me in God. I don't
[3:07:57] say to me. Amen. Amen. I was a
[3:08:01] sinner. Now he saved
[3:08:04] me. He didn't push me back again.
[3:08:08] Amen.
[3:08:11] We are going
[3:08:15] in Jesus is no failure.
[3:08:20] Amen. Amen. You become who he
[3:08:26] is. Amen. Amen. He is coming.
[3:08:31] You are coming.
[3:08:33] [Applause]
[3:08:36] Let me read just the last
[3:08:39] thing. We still need to come to the
[3:08:42] angels,
[3:08:43] the pyramid of
[3:08:47] angels. But let me just read it and
[3:08:49] close here what we going to uh talk
[3:08:55] about. The angel was very notable to me.
[3:09:01] The rest of them just
[3:09:07] seemed but this one was notable.
[3:09:13] But this angel was a noted
[3:09:20] angel just like the
[3:09:23] message that we have
[3:09:25] believed is
[3:09:28] notable to
[3:09:31] us. Amen. Amen. How can you tell me
[3:09:34] something
[3:09:36] different from what I have already
[3:09:39] received?
[3:09:43] That's why I cannot say rock of
[3:09:49] aes for me if things go
[3:09:59] well. But if something wrong
[3:10:03] happens, then he's not of
[3:10:07] ages. Let me finish. And I'm the angel
[3:10:12] was notable to
[3:10:15] me. The rest of them just
[3:10:18] was seemed ordinary.
[3:10:22] You know when we were coming we were
[3:10:24] coming this
[3:10:25] way. There's so many church
[3:10:29] buildings but they're just
[3:10:32] ordinary. Amen. Amen. We were looking
[3:10:35] for the notable
[3:10:40] Amen. The rest of
[3:10:43] them. Amen. Amen. We say Jesus, they
[3:10:47] also say Jesus.
[3:10:50] You say God,
[3:10:52] they amen. Amen. But they are not
[3:10:55] notable. Amen.
[3:10:58] But there's difference
[3:11:02] uh between the Jesus
[3:11:07] and the notable one.
[3:11:11] All right. Amen. Amen.
[3:11:13] I promised that this is the last. But
[3:11:16] the angel was a
[3:11:18] noted
[3:11:21] angel. He was to my left in the
[3:11:23] constellation.
[3:11:26] in the form of a
[3:11:29] pyramid. You know, they all come in the
[3:11:31] form of a
[3:11:32] pyramid. You'll see even
[3:11:36] Jerusalem. The prophet tells me in the
[3:11:39] form of
[3:11:40] pyramid, the angel of the the pyramid of
[3:11:44] angels in the form of
[3:11:48] pyramid
[3:11:49] Jerusalem in the form of the pyramid. So
[3:11:53] all is in the form
[3:11:56] of okay. Amen. Yeah. It was in the
[3:12:00] pyramid where the mysterious white stone
[3:12:04] was not written.
[3:12:10] [Music]
[3:12:15] took me into that pyramid of themselves.
[3:12:22] I know this is not a church
[3:12:25] material.
[3:12:28] No, the mystery of
[3:12:31] God known only to
[3:12:38] them. The things that we have received,
[3:12:43] they are known only to us.
[3:12:47] [Applause]
[3:12:49] Amen. That's right.
[3:12:51] Then was the
[3:12:53] messengers had
[3:12:56] come to interpret
[3:12:59] that
[3:13:01] pyramid or that
[3:13:04] message of the
[3:13:06] secret of these seven
[3:13:09] seals which
[3:13:11] lays within the pyramid pyramid.
[3:13:15] [Applause]
[3:13:17] If
[3:13:19] somebody tells you no it is not
[3:13:23] revealed it that's when he is he he's
[3:13:27] actually saying to
[3:13:28] you I am not in the
[3:13:35] pyramid you know the white stone was
[3:13:37] where in the pyramid in the
[3:13:40] pyramid now somebody says I don't
[3:13:42] believe
[3:13:43] that yes because we are not in the
[3:13:45] pyramid.
[3:13:47] [Applause]
[3:13:51] which lays within the the seven seals,
[3:13:55] not six, which lays with inside the
[3:14:02] [Applause]
[3:14:03] pyramid. The angel was to my
[3:14:07] left would really be the
[3:14:11] last or the seventh.
[3:14:16] Amen. That's why somebody
[3:14:20] says I don't even believe you say yes
[3:14:23] because you are not in the
[3:14:26] pyramid. Amen.
[3:14:29] If we would count them from left to
[3:14:32] right, he was on my
[3:14:35] left. Me looking to
[3:14:39] him, looking
[3:14:41] towards
[3:14:43] worse. Amen. That's why he says I went
[3:14:50] westward to connect.
[3:14:53] Amen. Amen. And
[3:14:56] those to whom the seven seal was
[3:15:01] revealed they means they went westward.
[3:15:09] [Applause]
[3:15:11] westward. Him coming, we'll talk about
[3:15:13] east and
[3:15:15] west. Him coming towards the
[3:15:19] east will be on the left
[3:15:22] side. That would be the last angel's
[3:15:26] message. Very
[3:15:29] notable. Remember how I said is God his
[3:15:34] head back?
[3:15:37] his great sharp
[3:15:38] wings and how he flew right to
[3:15:44] me. Hallelujah. Each
[3:15:47] one has an angel. The angel he says flew
[3:15:56] right to
[3:15:58] me. Then we are still we we are still
[3:16:01] going to
[3:16:02] look who's this angel.
[3:16:05] And then but now it it
[3:16:08] says h the secret of this seven seals.
[3:16:14] How many seals
[3:16:16] which
[3:16:17] lays within the pyramid?
[3:16:21] Anything that is without the
[3:16:23] pyramid is
[3:16:27] six and six
[3:16:31] is the number of men.
[3:16:34] That's why the the the
[3:16:38] the seals of the s of a
[3:16:43] man they end up where
[3:16:47] six if somebody says I don't believe the
[3:16:52] seven because you are
[3:16:56] six cannot believe
[3:17:00] seven. Amen. Now the angel was to my
[3:17:05] left would be the
[3:17:09] last or seventh
[3:17:12] angel. I don't want to say you don't
[3:17:16] understand what that what I'm reading
[3:17:18] about but we are getting to
[3:17:23] uh where you will
[3:17:25] understand if we would count them from
[3:17:29] the left to to
[3:17:34] right. He was on my
[3:17:36] left me looking to
[3:17:41] him. Amen. But no, don't open the the
[3:17:45] head, open the heart. Yeah. Amen.
[3:17:49] Because if you open the head, the thing
[3:17:52] that you are listening to will end up in
[3:17:55] the
[3:17:57] head. He was on my me looking to
[3:18:01] him towards
[3:18:04] west him.
[3:18:07] I'm reading this so that next
[3:18:09] time I can say you remember that
[3:18:14] him here he is here.
[3:18:18] Amen. Amen. Amen. Me looking to him
[3:18:22] towards
[3:18:23] west coming towards the
[3:18:27] east would be on the
[3:18:32] left. Amen. That would be the last
[3:18:35] angel's message.
[3:18:40] You know the message that you
[3:18:42] believe is the message that you are
[3:18:44] looking
[3:18:45] at. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. Very notable
[3:18:51] because he is looking at it. He's very
[3:18:55] notable. How I said he had his
[3:19:02] you know right in the
[3:19:05] chair I am not looking at
[3:19:10] somebody like sometimes if I'm looking
[3:19:14] at a a
[3:19:16] man that man can
[3:19:19] say drunkards shall not inherit the
[3:19:22] kingdom of
[3:19:25] God when arrive home with the
[3:19:29] family. They are no longer returning to
[3:19:31] that
[3:19:32] church. Is there a person who can
[3:19:39] drink the people they drink? Even the
[3:19:42] pastors blame somebody.
[3:19:48] Brother, have you come to church for to
[3:19:52] blame somebody or for to worship
[3:19:57] God? So if you worship God, how can you
[3:20:00] leave God for
[3:20:03] God?
[3:20:09] Because you are not a
[3:20:12] Christian. a
[3:20:15] Christian doesn't go around blaming
[3:20:18] people
[3:20:19] saying when he was
[3:20:21] saying he was referring to me then you
[3:20:24] are not a
[3:20:26] [Applause]
[3:20:32] Christian to blame
[3:20:35] somebody he comes to church to worship
[3:20:40] [Applause]
[3:20:43] I can't come and sit here only to listen
[3:20:47] and
[3:20:48] see. You will hear you will talk about
[3:20:51] it. You'll hear you are not a Christian.
[3:20:54] A Christian has come to
[3:20:58] worship. That's
[3:21:00] all. He hasn't come to hear what
[3:21:03] somebody says about
[3:21:06] you. No. No. No. No, no, no. Let's talk
[3:21:09] about Jesus.
[3:21:13] Lastly, he says,
[3:21:15] that angel, he says he flew right to me.
[3:21:21] You can also say he flew right to
[3:21:26] me. You know, a prophet, an angel can
[3:21:29] come to you in the form of a
[3:21:33] prophet. Amen. But being an angel coming
[3:21:38] to you.
[3:21:40] That's why in
[3:21:42] closing, have we come to church
[3:21:46] to listen to who says what about
[3:21:50] you or who says what about
[3:21:58] Jesus? Have you heard me say coming to
[3:22:01] church,
[3:22:02] you don't come
[3:22:04] like to listen to somebody?
[3:22:11] brother
[3:22:14] smoking talking about me. We haven't
[3:22:17] come for such
[3:22:19] jokes if I have done something
[3:22:23] wrong. I'll be
[3:22:25] happy to ask for
[3:22:29] [Applause]
[3:22:31] mercy.
[3:22:33] Amen. Somebody finds you
[3:22:36] with a girlfriend there.
[3:22:39] And
[3:22:41] somebody after hearing
[3:22:44] that he tells
[3:22:49] somebody that I I I'm afraid to call
[3:22:53] names because maybe somebody I will call
[3:22:56] name somebody
[3:22:59] else I'm not referring to him. Amen.
[3:23:03] Amen.
[3:23:05] So brothers in closing I have come here
[3:23:10] to
[3:23:12] worship if I have done wrong I don't
[3:23:16] blame any
[3:23:18] person I bow
[3:23:20] down ask for
[3:23:24] mercy yes amen I don't go around
[3:23:31] saying no that's not Christianity
[3:23:36] Christianity. Somebody who fights
[3:23:38] himself in the
[3:23:40] wrong bows before
[3:23:45] God. That is
[3:23:48] Christianity. We are we don't go around
[3:23:50] in the church asking for some for for
[3:23:54] the names of the
[3:23:56] people who perhaps have said something
[3:23:59] about me. No, I'm not here for that.
[3:24:03] I'm here to
[3:24:06] worship. If I have done anything wrong.
[3:24:09] Should you come to me and say
[3:24:13] brother I saw you this
[3:24:15] this I will say my brother start praying
[3:24:19] for me.
[3:24:21] [Applause]
[3:24:23] I also want to
[3:24:27] enter. Amen. The Bible says he who hides
[3:24:31] his
[3:24:34] sin. What about the person?
[3:24:45] The
[3:24:46] Bible is a fool.
[3:24:53] Yes. We ask to hide yourself.
[3:24:58] It is like to hide a snake in your
[3:25:02] [Applause]
[3:25:04] [Music]
[3:25:08] pocket. This is the
[3:25:11] seventh brothers and

[3:47:24] heard this, they were pricked in their

[3:47:29] rest of the apostles, "Men and brethren,
[3:47:32] what shall we do?" Then Peter said unto
[3:47:35] them, "Repent, and be baptized, every
[3:47:38] one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ
[3:47:41] for the remission of sins, and ye shall
[3:47:44] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. For
[3:47:46] the promise is unto you and to your
