Amen. &gt;&gt; He could see a far off when he saw the spirit in the form of a dove &gt;&gt; coming down to land upon the son of the lamp of God. &gt;&gt; And [music] he was watching when he saw it was right in the morning at the right time &gt;&gt; to introduce the Messiah to the Jews. [music] Father, we are so thankful today. Father, another great eagle &gt;&gt; came father on the wings of a dove. &gt;&gt; And the father, he also came. He was standing right on top of the mountain &gt;&gt; there looking east, west, south, [music] north, announcing the coming of the Lord. &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you this morning father as we open the book uh you are the one who will talk to us &gt;&gt; this morning.

All right, [applause] &gt;&gt; let's We are still around the throne. &gt;&gt; It will take us a bit of time around the throne. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. God bless you for that sound, you know. &gt;&gt; Yes. You know, when I'm at home sometimes for reading, I will take a similar and put it there while reading it combines with the word of God. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. Amen. Let's this today the books were open. Now you realize that at the time of the judgment books are opened. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But and another book called the book of life &gt;&gt; and another one the length book of life. Now I just want us to take h where is that? That throne. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Okay. &gt;&gt; Is it there? &gt;&gt; Okay. Now, this lamb's book of life. &gt;&gt; Oh, you may take your seat. This lamb's book of life. I even if you read Revelation chapter 20, Uh let me take you there a bit and I saw thrones and they that they no no uh not verse 20 please that that is some will come to this thrones. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I I hope we are not in hurry &gt;&gt; to reach the rapture although it is in a hurry. the rapture but we are we will reach the rapture. We also have now now this all this is rapturing faith. We we are going through the rapturing faith. You know I was just reading something but we will take it the next time. It says the Lord now is outside the church and in Malawi I took that part that part that the messenger left the church and went west what was it west what &gt;&gt; yes to connect with the angel's message We will come to to those things and show that he he is not in the church, he's outside the church. Now those who follow him will have to leave the church. Amen. And Follow him where he is &gt;&gt; because outside the church means the ministry has changed. Amen. &gt;&gt; You remember how he fed the people with fish and bread. The Bible says after that he jumped into a ship to go across. And the Bible says John 6, you know the scripture. The next morning the people came to where he fed the thousands thinking that he is still there. Then the Bible says when they arrive he was not there. Amen. &gt;&gt; They wondered at it because they thought that was the place of worship. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then because he was still on his way to the cross. Then uh then they also took the ship to the other side. But when they arrived the message, church Amen. &gt;&gt; And so they wondered because they thought there is still bread and fish on the other side. But the there was still bread and bread, but it has changed to be his body. For he said to them, "Except you eat the flesh of the son of man and drink his blood, you have no life." You see, he changed from that bread and fish to his flesh and blood. &gt;&gt; Now he was now on the other side. Now even this morning he is on the other side of the seven churches. The ministry has changed already. &gt;&gt; It's something else now. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And when the seals were open, he had the prophet had to go westward and the ministry changed. &gt;&gt; All right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now here we are. uh the scripture our scripture here now if you read this about the throne you realize there's no mentioned here of the lamb's book of life it just say I saw the I I saw the dead small and great stand before God, and the books were opened, and another book was opened, which is the book of life, and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books, according to their works. Now, here they were judged according to their works. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now the the the bride of Christ is not going to judgement because he he she is not judge according to her works. Amen. We will come to that she she was already judged. Amen. Okay. But do this in these other books they will stand judgment and judged according to their works. Last last we have read the uh book of Matthew 25. Amen. Amen. the goats on the left and the sheep on the on the right. And you see they were judged according. He mentioned their works. You saw me when I was in jail, when I was hungered. They were they are judged according to their works. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now the bride is not here. Amen. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because she also will come here as partner or or the wife of the king. Amen. She's going to judge not judged. Amen. Now those in the books here are judged. But she is not judged. She's not she don't even appear here. Amen. And the sea gave up the dead which were in it. And death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them. And they were judged every man according to their &gt;&gt; works. &gt;&gt; Works. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now if you are a a a hardworking man or woman, you are going to be judged. &gt;&gt; The bride is not a hardworking woman. She was predestinated. Amen. And whosoever was not found written in the book of life because those in the book of life will be judged. Some some will be found judged according to their works. Then some will receive white robes according to their works. I hope I hope you you have switched off your mentality. &gt;&gt; Now and whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire straight away. This one is not even judged. &gt;&gt; He was judged already. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And straight away to the lake of fire. &gt;&gt; But do these others have to stand judgment. &gt;&gt; All right. Amen. &gt;&gt; In the book of life. &gt;&gt; The one who is not in the book of life. Amen. The one who is not in the book of life, he is just cast straight away into the lake of fire. Amen. &gt;&gt; There's nothing that he can say. Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now there's no mention here of the lamb's book of life. Amen. &gt;&gt; And now Revelation chapter 5. &gt;&gt; Did we read chapter one? Chapter 5 verse one. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; All right. All right. Let's go back to this. Go &gt;&gt; chapter 1 to it's lengthy bit to 9. &gt;&gt; Revelation 5 verse 1-9. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside sealed with seven seals. And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, who is worthy to open the book, and to lose the seals thereof? And no man in heaven, nor in earth, neither under the earth was able to open the book, neither to look thereon. And I wept much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book, neither to look thereon. And one of the elders saith unto me, weep not, behold, the lion of the tribe of Judah, the root of David, has prevailed to open the book, and to lose the seven seals thereof. And I beheld and lo in the midst of the throne and of the four beast and in the midst of the elders stood a lamb as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the earth. And he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne. And when he had taken the book, the four beasts and four and 20 elders fell down before the lamb, having every one of them hops and golden vials full of orders, which are the prayers of the saints. And they sung a new song, saying, Thou art worthy to take the book, and to open the seals thereof. For thou was slain, and has redeemed us to God by thy blood out of every kindred and tongues and people and nation. Brother, &gt;&gt; this is it's not this one. It's this one. Amen. &gt;&gt; We are starting there. &gt;&gt; Yes. And uh All right. God bless you. &gt;&gt; I I'm I'm looking at something. I I want us to first uh see actually what is this book of life or the lamb's book of life. That's why it is so much rejected by the people today. I I'm told they are just preaching the sixth seal. Amen. And I said we are going to take both the six and the seven &gt;&gt; when we arrive there to help the people. Let me just say it straight. Cape Town. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You follow us there. You can even start now. We'll find you there because we are going to look at the sixth and the seventh seal. Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay? Because the six is the tribulation. But right now, let's look at this. And I saw in the right hand. Now mark this in the right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because uh the right hand &gt;&gt; now that's why we I find the bride of Christ the right hand when he died. The Bible says he ascended up and sat on there at the right hand of the of the majesty. There's something about this right hand, the right hand of the majesty. Okay. Amen. and uh not to say something of myself of course a brother there's many of but I I'll quote only one we were fishing together then he comes and says &gt;&gt; my hand is not working &gt;&gt; I don't know whether it was right or left. &gt;&gt; So I said &gt;&gt; and then I said to him it will work. &gt;&gt; Yeah. If there's a witness here who is not selfish, he will say amen to daddy. Witness is the person who was there. Then I said okay let me take your hand. Amen. Amen. And after that &gt;&gt; the hand went. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Why? Because I used my right hand. &gt;&gt; Now you always look at this right hand. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Lucifer Lucifer &gt;&gt; was the right hand man. The prophet, my prophet tells me so and it is in the Bible. He was the right hand man. So he lost the post because being in that post he thought that he could do something saying I I can become a ruler. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I can rule from above. And that's when that's what the mistake he made. Sin not mistake. Sin &gt;&gt; is when you think that you know better than the pastor. Yeah. You think so. And because you didn't hear the prophet of God saying the pastor is the angel of the church. &gt;&gt; How can you know better than the angel of the church? That caused Satan to be cast down. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He wouldn't take the word of the Almighty God. thinking that he knew better. And the Bible says because of his beauty, his brightness, he sinned you. I can be educated. &gt;&gt; That doesn't mean I know. Amen. &gt;&gt; I I know that if I know &gt;&gt; that's when I know God. Amen. &gt;&gt; The first wisdom is fear of God is the first wisdom. Amen. &gt;&gt; The first one &gt;&gt; then you have graduated. Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. H one brother said to me, &gt;&gt; don't always tell us that you are a standard six. You are standard six. &gt;&gt; I say if you want me to say I am what do you call it the highest? What is the highest standard? &gt;&gt; Doctorate. Yeah, if you want me to say that, I can say whatever you want me to say. If you want to me to say I've got honors, &gt;&gt; I will say it because we we as the children of God have got all right. Okay. Let let let us come here then. I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne. &gt;&gt; A book written within and without in which end. &gt;&gt; Now from here let us go just straight down from the right from this throne to the throne down but on the right. keeping the right side. Then it goes again to say now I I think already you are with me what is the lamb's book of life. Okay. Sometimes are you with me there? Now the book in the hands of whom? &gt;&gt; The one who sitth on the throne. &gt;&gt; Yes, that is the lamb's book of life. That is his book because no no one could open that book or could read out of that book because it is the book of the lamb. Amen. I hope somebody will hear it. I mean, let me let me just find something here. &gt;&gt; You know, when Christ is standing outside, it's difficult to understand him. That's why he's no longer in the church. Now a church goer &gt;&gt; will never understand &gt;&gt; because when they were when he he he was on the other side those who were still remaining on this side could not hear what he was saying on the other side. If you are in a church age, you will never hear him. When he is speaking and he's on the other side, we are going we following some things that that you will understand what I'm talking about. Okay, let us read. This is the Bible now. And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice. Not just an angel, a strong one. It takes a strong angel here who is worthy to open the book and to lose the seals thereof. Amen. Now you see who who is worthy. That's why the people if I I I'm not with you I won't even understand what is the the seventh seal &gt;&gt; because it was opened by the one who is worthy he shed his blood. So he he was found to be worthy because that is his book. Brethren, while I'm talking, let me find you a book here by grace and then we'll look into it. H I hope is this one here. I hope so. God bless you, brethren. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We are just h feasting on the eagle manner. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If it's not this one, I will find a book. &gt;&gt; But I want to read something here. You know meanwhile while while I'm looking for it let me say to you this is the book which the prophet of God says the Lord Jesus has signed it is the book only a page let me see perhaps Maybe I'm looking for something I've got here. &gt;&gt; Um, yeah, pardon with me a bit. &gt;&gt; Where is my book? Where is my book? Okay, while while I'm looking for you, let me say to you, he says, "This is the only book that the Lord has put his signature on." Amen. He he he he speaks if I don't find it now we still going to read it &gt;&gt; Satan &gt;&gt; hates the book of Genesis &gt;&gt; and Revelation. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because they both expose him. Now he says that book is not for everybody. Don't worry, I'm still going to read it. &gt;&gt; It's not for everybody. It's a book specially &gt;&gt; h for a certain class of people. It says, "So, okay, let me you will hear when I read it that it will exactly tell you what I'm saying to you." He says this is the only book the Lord has put his own signature. It comes with his signature and no man could read it because no man recognized the signature. Amen. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now which seal it's so unfamiliar with the people. the servants because they say he said nothing. All right. Amen. Now we'll come to something &gt;&gt; where there is nothing to the bride there is something. Amen. &gt;&gt; But to the public to just a man is nothing. But there is it is something. Because when you go to buy a house, they want both your signature and your wife's signature. Amen. Amen. Yet there's nothing to the other one because you are the owner and you are the one that is buying the house. Somebody else would know nothing about it. Only those with the those who have put their signature their name. &gt;&gt; Yeah, I'm going to read it. Don't worry. But let's let's continue here. He has put his signature on it. And it says &gt;&gt; this book &gt;&gt; will only will will be understood by a special class. &gt;&gt; Wait until we read it. &gt;&gt; Maybe now you think it's me saying that. You'll see. You'll hear. Okay. Here we here we ask. And no man in heaven nor in earth, neither under the earth was able to open, let alone to read it to open the book. Amen. neither to look there on &gt;&gt; it was silence where &gt;&gt; and what about in earth? &gt;&gt; Because it never said &gt;&gt; here on earth but in heaven. And he says the angels did not understand because the mysteries are not to the for the angels. They are for men. Amen. When they are still hidden, they are gods. Men, they are revealed. &gt;&gt; If unrevealed, they belong to God. But God never said he will reveal them to the angels because the angels minister unto us. Amen. Did you know that Peter says, "Even the angels, they desired to see the things that we see." Amen. &gt;&gt; Even the angels desired. Okay. Amen. Are you listening friends? Now the we are sons and even the Lord Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; came and took the form of Abraham &gt;&gt; not of angels. The Bible says so the form of the image the form of Abraham a man. Amen. We'll read it. That's right. So that's why he never said, "Let us make angels in our image." But he said, "Let us make men." Amen. And the Bible answer, "Who is men?" Amen. because he himself became man until when they looked at him, they saw men until they crucified him as a man. But on the third day when he rose again, that is not man. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's man when they crucified you. &gt;&gt; But he was not man. when he rose again. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the difference. &gt;&gt; Okay. Now you consider us of men. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; But I I wonder, &gt;&gt; how are you going to consider us as the judges? As judges. Amen. When we come to the throne, God will still consider us as just men because we will be judges there. &gt;&gt; And in heaven, we are like high priests. And the Bible says he has made us priests. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I wept. I wept. Verse four. Because no man was found worth it to open and to read the book, neither to look here on. I think you understand this book. You know this book. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And one of the elders says unto me, weep not. Behold, the the lion of the tribe of Judah, the root of David, hath prevailed to open the book to lose the seven seals thereof. Because if you have not prevailed, you can't even read it. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's for the overcomers. Amen. In the church ages, you find just the church members and what they call the overcomers. Amen. We will come to that. Now you you if you take the right hand side, &gt;&gt; you are coming down the overcomers. You'll hear that book will talk about them. &gt;&gt; Then we are going to read even out of the book of church ages overcomers. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because be before you can be found worthy, you must overcome. Amen. &gt;&gt; You overcome to possess. Amen. &gt;&gt; You overcome to hear to understand. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. after &gt;&gt; overcoming &gt;&gt; is then those those who overcame &gt;&gt; received not ropes like those who were judged according to their works but they stand there as judges listen what it says the whole as you going downh the other one wept the all all of them looking for a worthy one the worthy one here is the book but who is worthy and they wanted to know what's in this book they know that they are named are in the book. Brother Brenham says John saw his name. When he saw his name beyond the kitten of time, then he said there is John. Amen. Amen. Amen. that was beyond the now those who can see their names in the lamb's book they know that there is my name and because his name is there he can read that book now and understand what is written in the book because his name is there all right amen Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, behold, they said, "Weep no, don't weep. One of the elders said unto me, weep not. Behold, the lamb of the tribe of Judah, the root of David, hath prevailed, and opened the book to lose their seven sins." In this book, it is the what? What of the sun? &gt;&gt; The rising of the sun. &gt;&gt; It is the rising of the sun. &gt;&gt; The sun. S O N. &gt;&gt; It says &gt;&gt; he is the seals. Amen. &gt;&gt; That were opened. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because he opened the seals. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And simply I can say &gt;&gt; the prophet will come and read it. The prophet says &gt;&gt; he opened the seals &gt;&gt; and gave it to the seventh angel messenger. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For him it is in the book. You've got it. &gt;&gt; But wait until we read it. He tore off the seal and gave the book to the seventh angel messenger. Amen. Sometimes we put it so straight and say he gave the book to brother Brennham. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And it's hard to say amen to that. He came with the book. He gave it to brother Bren. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's too simple for a person whose name is not there. When he gave it, he says he gave it to the seventh angel messenger for to reveal it to the church. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; If you are waiting for revelation, the revelation don't come flying and jump into you or fly into you. When Cenius was waiting for the answer from God, there came Peter from Job. &gt;&gt; That was the answer. Amen. Do you know that when the man when the chariot from Jerusalem was reading the book of Isaiah's and he could not understand it and until God sent out Philillip and when Philip arrived the man was on a chariot and Philip said can I help you sir? Yeah, I've got I I'm reading here. I'm struggling here. &gt;&gt; But there's no man. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; To interpret this to me. &gt;&gt; So he was in need of a man. &gt;&gt; That is the word of God. But he needed a man. &gt;&gt; What's wrong with the people? &gt;&gt; He needed a man. to interpret to him. &gt;&gt; He didn't say angel. &gt;&gt; He said, "There is no man to interpret to me." &gt;&gt; Philip said, "Here I am." Amen. &gt;&gt; It is from God. It must be interpreted by men. That's how God did it. And we do it always like that. It has to come from God then through a man to a man. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And when Philip then Philillip interpreted to him and his eyes opened and said what now? Philip said here is water. He baptized him and vanished out. Amen. &gt;&gt; When there was no man worthy in the in the garden in Eden, the Bible says there was no man worthy there. There was no man to always man. Because man is God's partner. &gt;&gt; The other part of the contract is held by men. You are deceived to say you must find a manifer. &gt;&gt; Yes, you worship. He was reading. He was from Jerusalem. Jerusalem. After that revival, he needed a man. Amen. And brother Benham says &gt;&gt; not an angel man. &gt;&gt; He says because man &gt;&gt; is a gene. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He didn't look for an angel. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Cornelius. &gt;&gt; Cornelius. &gt;&gt; He needed &gt;&gt; a man. Peter. When they approach God, &gt;&gt; God said, "See Peter, &gt;&gt; let us do our rounds, our rounds." When Saul &gt;&gt; was blinded by God on his way to arrest the Christians when he was now blind, he was sent to Anas. &gt;&gt; Anas amen. or God. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Who is What is man? &gt;&gt; I'll read to you the book of Hebrews. Ask a question. What is man? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Is a being that God will would consider so much until Even back there, he molded things and sent them to a man to Adam to see what Adam would say. &gt;&gt; He didn't when he sent like a lion to Adam, he never gossip in his ear and say this one is a lion. Amen. He waited for Adam. There it is. &gt;&gt; If Adam says lion, &gt;&gt; the Bible says God said amen. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why it says what is man to be considered by God so much. Amen. Hey, Jesus was just like that. &gt;&gt; He is a man. He eats, he sleeps, he gets tired. You could find him sleeping. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; At one time he was sleeping in a ship. Amen. Amen. Amen. And when the the contrary arrived, it's it's bad out there &gt;&gt; and always he would wake up to say where is your faith? Because he could he considered men to be like him. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So he never said, "Oh, sorry. &gt;&gt; Sorry, brother. &gt;&gt; Sorry, brother. &gt;&gt; I just fell asleep." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; To Peter, you know, many people thought that when Peter started to sank, the Lord would say, My son, my son is sinking. &gt;&gt; But he said and he said, "You of little faith because &gt;&gt; he did not make men to be like that." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He wanted Peter to be like him. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why he say, "Oh, you of little faith. You are disappointing me because you were supposed to walk like me upon upon the water. Now you are crying out here and you are really belittling my ministry. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen sister. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen sister. &gt;&gt; Amen. Means &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah. &gt;&gt; It's like that. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There was a pastor I'm told &gt;&gt; he was preaching to some people and then they were like just looking at him like this. The brother says and the pastor said, "Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen." &gt;&gt; They were looking at him. One sister there saying, "Amen." Then they saw him picking his bags and he went out. I'm not saying I'll do that. No. Whether you say amen or not, I could because I'm preaching to the bride of Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Not to everybody. That's why we spend sleepless nights because we are dealing with the bride of Christ. Amen. Amen. God has put it upon us. Be serious about this message and put everything aside because we are dealing with equality. equality. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So now it takes equality to deal with equality. Now for the bride of Christ, you don't just come and say no, you can't do that. When the bride of Christ, you've got to dig because these things are not from here. They are from before the foundation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. And I beheld verse six. &gt;&gt; Lo, in the midst of the throne, and of the four beasts, in the midst of the elders stood a lamp. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You see where where where he was found. in the midst of the throne in the midst of the four beasts, in the midst of the elders stood on them as it had been slain, having seven horns. We'll talk about that. Seven eyes, which are seven spirits of God, sent forth into the earth. Amen. &gt;&gt; Do you know which do you know these seven spirits? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You see where the spirits are from? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Uh Pastor Freddy, &gt;&gt; Pastor Freddy &gt;&gt; from Congo, &gt;&gt; he said to me uh that time he was at my house. He said &gt;&gt; uh &gt;&gt; uh you know Belgium. &gt;&gt; Go Belgium. Amen. &gt;&gt; He even mentioned Italy. &gt;&gt; Where is where is Vatican? Where where is it situated? &gt;&gt; In Italy. &gt;&gt; Yeah. He said in Italy they want to you to visit and I will take you there. &gt;&gt; That is pastor Freddy. &gt;&gt; Pastor Fred. &gt;&gt; I'm saying pastor because the Bible says he's a pastor. And a prophet says he is a pastor. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let me say to you, a young man came to me And he said, "Brother Brenham says," he actually wanted the people to say, "Brother," &gt;&gt; I said, "Yes, that is brother, but I call him prophet." Am I wrong to do that? The Bible says he is a prophet and me, I call him prophet. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And then uh I said and the Bible says &gt;&gt; I shall give you pastors. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So the Bible gave me a pastor. &gt;&gt; You know, but if me I say don't call me pastor, &gt;&gt; call me brother. It's me. &gt;&gt; It's not the Bible. The Bible says pastor says pastor, &gt;&gt; you know, church politics, &gt;&gt; I hate them. You even change the Bible just for the sake of being different. Why you call this man pastor? They say, let them ask me. I'll say because the Bible says he is the pastor. &gt;&gt; Okay. I'm glad that you are this. There is let me speak to this elders here. Not preach to them but speak to them. There is this young sister. She came to me and said they say you She visited a certain church. They said, "You know that pastor of yours. He's not Israel. He's Jacob." &gt;&gt; I said, "Yeah, a brother tells me that that sister says they told her like that in the in a they were in a car from that certain fellowship." I said, You you you showed your sister this. Are they aware of the two fingers? &gt;&gt; Right. If this one says, &gt;&gt; who's that? The brother to or if this one say Jacob &gt;&gt; and this one says Are you aware? Are we Hey, the church. &gt;&gt; Are you aware of that? &gt;&gt; If you say &gt;&gt; supplant &gt;&gt; Jacob, &gt;&gt; this finger says &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, let's finish it today. Then God, let's ask God, God, what do you say now here? The people say this one is a suppler is Jacob. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God just put it for us. &gt;&gt; And God said, "I love Jacob." &gt;&gt; Can you say it? Say, "I love Jacob." I love Jacob. &gt;&gt; You're afraid. Eldashu. &gt;&gt; Yes. The elders say, "I love Jacob." This is what God has said. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Before it was changed. And the angel said, &gt;&gt; "Amen." &gt;&gt; The angel said, &gt;&gt; "What's your name?" &gt;&gt; Jacob. &gt;&gt; And he said, "Jacob." Now he said the angel said from today thou art thou shalt be called. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So now because there is it is from what you are and to who you are. Amen. &gt;&gt; I was a I'm a sinner but saved by grace. &gt;&gt; Then I am a Christian. Amen. &gt;&gt; Somebody can continue to call me sinner but God will continue to call me my son. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. This things man are just for the those with God's wisdom. They know how to answer things and they know who they are. I'll tell you that I will tell you that I have no problem. &gt;&gt; An angry sister I was in Bumanga said to me, I know why she was angry with me. &gt;&gt; Yes, Jacob. You know what? How I answered her? &gt;&gt; I said, "Hello, my sister." &gt;&gt; And she said, "Jacob, how are you, Jacob? &gt;&gt; I'm fine, my sister. How are you? And how's the children?" She can't hurt me. How how she going to help you? &gt;&gt; Otherwise, how are you? &gt;&gt; Otherwise, I would have said, &gt;&gt; "God bless you. Ye shall know the truth &gt;&gt; and the truth &gt;&gt; shall set you free." &gt;&gt; Amen. As long as I know Esau, I don't have a problem. And as long as I know what did God say to Jacob, no problem. All right. Now God says they are pastors. &gt;&gt; If you want to change it, you can change it. &gt;&gt; Amen. And he came and took the book verse seven &gt;&gt; out of the which hand right hand. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Of him that sat upon the throne. &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, it reminds me of Job. &gt;&gt; He said, &gt;&gt; "I go left. &gt;&gt; I can perceive him." &gt;&gt; But he says left he workth on the left and he hides himself on the right hand. You see, so he is right in the &gt;&gt; That's why now his people are the right hand people. Amen. That's why that's why to the world the Bible says and the world don't know them. Amen. because they are not of the world. The world loves its own. Amen. &gt;&gt; I will read to you next John 17. The world don't love them when Jesus was praying. I am not of the world and they are not of the world. The world don't love them and that's why the world don't love me. The world is a system. The people, the systematic people, &gt;&gt; they don't love God &gt;&gt; because they say like this one who said, &gt;&gt; you know, this church is a good church. I love it. But hey, the lawsman, don't do this. Don't eat this. Don't touch. Don't put on this. You mustn't cut like what is life. That's why &gt;&gt; that's why a &gt;&gt; won't mind saving worshiing with us because he doesn't need to make funny haircuts. It comes just like that. It comes to the service just like that. A person got funny hairstyles because there are these there's a new one these days another bed with but that bed God made it like that. &gt;&gt; Amen. It comes with that hairstyle originally from God. this earth. I don't know why. Why can't you be human beings? &gt;&gt; When I come from God, &gt;&gt; when he says you are &gt;&gt; you are in Africa, &gt;&gt; go to Africa &gt;&gt; and I say yes Lord &gt;&gt; and I came to mommy. Africa &gt;&gt; and I came to Africa. &gt;&gt; You are &gt;&gt; you are a Chinese. &gt;&gt; Go to China. &gt;&gt; China. &gt;&gt; When he gets to China, he doesn't want to become an African. &gt;&gt; It's God's given nationality. Why don't we thank God for who we are? &gt;&gt; And for what he has made us to be. I am not ashamed to be an African. I always thank God for being an African. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A white man is my brother. &gt;&gt; Yellow man is my brother. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's God's variety. &gt;&gt; God wants us to be like flowers. One of different colors. That's why to me a white man is my brother. &gt;&gt; A Chinese is my brother. &gt;&gt; All right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hatred comes from Satan. &gt;&gt; I don't want it at all. &gt;&gt; If you don't want to walk with me, &gt;&gt; you must have hatred. Then I won't walk anymore with you. &gt;&gt; Mhm. &gt;&gt; And hey. Yeah. Listen, we are now on the throne. The throne does not want hatred. You can't bring hatred to the throne. Amen. &gt;&gt; And he came and took the book. &gt;&gt; Out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne. We are on the throne, &gt;&gt; but we are on the right hand side now. And then you'll see when we are standing before that throne. The bride will say that is the language when they are standing before the throne because you are going to realize that you'll find Christ and the wife occupying the throne to hand over to hand judgment to hand out judgment. And the prophet told us even last week, those who will judge you are those who have preached to you. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Did you hear that? Amen. &gt;&gt; So now the very people that are preaching to you are going to judge you. Amen. But don't worry. Don't worry. The best judge &gt;&gt; that day will be the man who has preached to you. Amen. Amen. Is that so, sister? &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; Now, I'm talking about the lamb's book of life. Now we we are coming as we are coming down to the throne because those in the lamb's book of life they are judges. Amen. Amen. Because that is his book. He had this book in his hand. Amen. And that's why we are the angel of the Lord was on the that angel on the right hand side. We will still read that. &gt;&gt; Even the angel was on the right hand side. Did you hear that? Amen. And the seventh angel messenger actually Satan was Lucifer was the right-hand man. But when he lost the the the the post, he envied Adam when he was sent down flying by. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; But the wonder of it all when he dropped down and Isaiah saw him and say, "Ah, &gt;&gt; how thou fallen yet some came and worship him. They are looking for luck from him, &gt;&gt; money, &gt;&gt; riches." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And then he can only say you must kill. I want blood. Yeah. Before I can give you this and that and it's costly, man. &gt;&gt; You must bring me blood. &gt;&gt; So that is his best cook. &gt;&gt; Okay. Verse eight. Maybe you don't understand. &gt;&gt; You can buy Coke, &gt;&gt; sugarf free or whatever. &gt;&gt; But the best cook for the devil worshippers is human blood. The judgment is coming. And when he had taken the book, verse eight, &gt;&gt; more verse 80, &gt;&gt; the four beasts and and four and 20 elders fell down before the lamb, having every one of them hs golden vials full of others, which are the prayers of saints. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hey, your prayer there before God. &gt;&gt; It gives order. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; The prayers of saints. A &gt;&gt; prayer of faith, a sincere prayer. It's a sweet smell before God. It is filling the house of God. Amen. The prayers of the saints and they sung a new song saying, "Thou art worthy to take the book." Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It is not just a book. &gt;&gt; It is the lamb's book. Amen. No one could take that book but the lamb but the right hand. &gt;&gt; That's why they say give me your right hand the right hand. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And they saw the saints. &gt;&gt; Look all the saints. &gt;&gt; We started here. You find some weeping. &gt;&gt; All of them looking for this for the for the one worthy, the worthy one. Because they had that in themselves that my name, I've been going to and fro. I have never seen my name. As the prophet says, Your name don't say in the book don't say never. But only the book reveals. &gt;&gt; If you have got a name in that book when it is opened, it reveals you. Amen. And to say it is revealed to you, that's when your name is revealed to you out of the book, the book of the lamb which he has signed himself with his own blood. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And it's not for everybody. It's it's for those uh whose names are in that book. But all this time they they were waiting like and brother Brennham says is my book my name there? He says I don't know but what I know my my our names were written before the foundation of the world in that book. Amen. And now that's why now today we not praying and fasting and digging or so. No, &gt;&gt; we we are just worshiping him who is worthy. Worship the worthy one. They sang a song. Thou art worthy to take the book. They they knew that no other man could redeem them. But the one who could has the power to take this book. Amen. &gt;&gt; There is a book there, but it is mysterious. We are looking for someone who is worthy. Open the book. And the elder said, "Don't you worry. The lamp has prevailed. Take and open the book." As you hear us saying, "The lamb's book of life." It doesn't appear when the books are called out there. The bride doesn't appear there. Those in those books shall be judged. Now the bride because she's not in that book in one of those books. She is a secret. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In the heart of God. Amen. That's why they sing a song, a new song, totally new because the one who held their secret and their names has opened to them the book. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the book to open the seals. Now the sixth seal is the sleeping vision with the 144,0004,000 &gt;&gt; in the tribulation period. It doesn't mention the seventh and because just before it loses. Yeah, we are is this route leading to to the right thing? the route we have taken. It will it will even take us up to the meeting in the air. Amen. &gt;&gt; This route. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't change. Just stay in stay in the middle. You know how God said was it to Joshua? Is it Joshua &gt;&gt; where he said keep in the middle of the road? Was it Joshua to the children of Israel? &gt;&gt; Don't you know the scripture? &gt;&gt; Joshua, my friend, you just right. Keep in the middle of the road. &gt;&gt; He said to the children of Israel, don't. He said, don't look to the right. Don't look to the left. Amen. Just keep in the middle of the road. All right. Now, this is the root &gt;&gt; taking us to a meeting in the air. Amen. &gt;&gt; And this is giving us the rapturing faith. You know, an eagle &gt;&gt; has rapturing faith. Amen. When when the time arrives for it to take off, &gt;&gt; it doesn't start and practice and so I'm practicing. No, the rapturing faith is already in it. It will just take off. Amen. And the prophet of God says you know when you come when the people are quarreling and one saying this is this one that is not that &gt;&gt; the eagle &gt;&gt; will never enjoy such a meeting &gt;&gt; when it starts here it goes up &gt;&gt; and I said amen to brother Brennham when he said amen the the the higher it goes, the better it can see. Amen. &gt;&gt; In the word of God, the higher you go in the word, the better you can see. Amen. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; I won't settle for just a sermon for the sake of being a sermon. Amen. Amen. But I will always look up. Brother Brenham says &gt;&gt; he saw it when it was caged and they're walking around but looking up. Meaning that I don't belong here. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why that's why we say &gt;&gt; Amen. I was once blind. Now I can see. Amen. &gt;&gt; No more turning back. I can't turn back because I've seen the beyond. You You see that? You hear you know that chorus says, &gt;&gt; "I've been on the mountain and I've seen the other side." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I've been on the mountain and my heart is satisfied. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is this man singing that song. being on the mountain because right now on the mountain on top of the seven churches you are now on on the mountain and on the mountain you know there was a cry from up the mountain saying to John saying to John come hither and I will show you things to come. The things that we are seeing here, you can only see them when you are on the mountain. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because the more you go higher, the more you see higher. Amen. Amen. And you can see what has happened there, what is happening here and what is ahead of me. Amen. That is the people of the right hand. They know where they are, where they come from, where they are going. Even if all of you can leave, I will still come to the church. Amen. &gt;&gt; And I will preach to myself, &gt;&gt; but I don't know where shall we go, Lord. The Lord said to Peter and them, "It's time for you to choose, brethren." Why? &gt;&gt; Why did you not go? Why did you not live with those ones? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Lord, where shall we &gt;&gt; for the words of eternal life are with you? Now since we are eternal beings, we were predestinated. Where shall we go? &gt;&gt; Now you you came here as the h the eternal life made flesh, eternal life in in a body. Now what we see of you is what is inside of you that's why where shall we go? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know if you are a true worshipper you come to a place where you can say where shall I go for I have found and seen the words of eternal life. Because if you are eternal, you will see the words of eternal life. Even even when they are in the bodies, but still because you have eternal life, you will see the words of eternal life. That's right, Peter. &gt;&gt; How do you know this? It is because I have eternal life. My theophony my theophony &gt;&gt; connects &gt;&gt; in there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We we he has come &gt;&gt; so that we with eternal life &gt;&gt; could reconnect. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why he came for &gt;&gt; and said Peter Phillip follow me. &gt;&gt; This is what he came for. He knew his own. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He never stood there with a loud hail saying, "Hallelujah, Philip, this is the gospel of Christ." He just said, "Follow me. It just connected. Connect &gt;&gt; and they just stood up and followed him without asking any question because they were not looking for a church. They were looking for the Messiah. When Messiah was here, they just connected there. Connect there's no other church for us. Where shall we go? And the Samaritan woman, she couldn't connect anywhere. So she came down went to Samaritan Church of God what? &gt;&gt; She couldn't she couldn't connect. Yes. &gt;&gt; She came out still prostituting. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But inside there was something else. &gt;&gt; The difference is is down there. That's the where the difference is. Amen. Amen. So the people could look at her and say This one loves me. &gt;&gt; But the wonder of it is the love of God. Predestination. When God Jesus arrived. He never looked at his dresses or hairstyle or what? Amen. Because as a child of God, I don't have any hairstyle. I've got hair given to me by God. &gt;&gt; Yes. I don't shave. I don't have hair. Even if I try to leave, &gt;&gt; but I still don't have God took mine earlier on. &gt;&gt; So I'm waiting for my hair. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; But you don't think I shaved. No, &gt;&gt; I don't I I don't I don't spend any money on those things. &gt;&gt; Amen. Thou art the worthy one. Now I'm going to close so that we we we we we'll come next just we we'll come back to continue. &gt;&gt; Oh, God bless you. God bless you. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Okay. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hey, we are so glad I I have a young man here on I just draft things and then I hand them over to him. Then he will go and harvest. &gt;&gt; So then they do this for me. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now he can spend a night with me. &gt;&gt; Comes and spend a night &gt;&gt; when I run these things with my hand and give to him. &gt;&gt; So it's helping me here. &gt;&gt; It's just I'm trying to make things easier. You right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We close with this. That is now if I come let let me see his body now. The body of Christ. &gt;&gt; Let let us read here. Now you you have seen all of the right coming down the right hand side. Mhm. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; His wife. &gt;&gt; Revelation. I want to read something here again. Revelation 10 verse 1 to3. Do you've got it? &gt;&gt; Okay. And I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud. And a rainbow was upon his head, and his face was as it were the sun, and his feet as the pillars of fire. And he had in his hand a little book open. Then he set his right foot upon the sea, and his left foot on the earth, and cried with a loud voice. And as when a lion roarth, and when he had cried, seven thunders uttered their voices. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But that is the gospel, brother. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I saw another mighty angel. &gt;&gt; Amen. meaning that &gt;&gt; we are the bride of Christ &gt;&gt; in the midst of angels. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven clothed with a cloud. A rainbow was upon his head and his face as it were the sun, his feet as pillars of fire. Here is the book again. And he had in his hand a little book. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If I were asked maybe do you want to worship God? And they would say to me, choose the place where you'd want to go for to worship. I will read these scriptures and say, "I want to worship here. When I can see this mighty angel come down with a cloud rain, I I I want to worship here. I don't need oil coffee and I enough at my home. I'm I'm even warned not to take too much coffee. So I don't need all those things. I not I don't need favor. No, I only need to be under this place, this ministry &gt;&gt; where I'm told here's an angel. The angels are coming to that place. You know, the book is coming down from there to the place. I want to worship at such a place when things that God has sent down would have come my way. &gt;&gt; That's why he says here now now he had a book again. Here's a book opened. Now this time it is opened. Amen. It was sealed a book sealed seven. Amen. &gt;&gt; Will come to seal the back. It has the backside because you have the seven church ages. You got the seven seals. So the book now &gt;&gt; uh is the back side the back side of the book is the mysteries. Is that right? Because the backside will tell you that you know there's a a part here the book of seals I think the the the back side of the of the book we will follow it because it is even the h where it is I just want to I'm going to get you this one here. uh because of uh running to and fro some of the things I've got to as you see things are sticking out of here so so that I can be able to run &gt;&gt; all the way again all the way back from Genesis &gt;&gt; this seventh seal &gt;&gt; is spoken of from the very beginning. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why the people can't see it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because the Bible says &gt;&gt; uh John uh John chapter one here in Ghana, &gt;&gt; that which was from the beginning, &gt;&gt; that which was &gt;&gt; from the beginning, &gt;&gt; from the beginning which we have &gt;&gt; amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now that is from from &gt;&gt; from the beginning. &gt;&gt; So now a child of God, &gt;&gt; let me tell you something. I'm closing now. &gt;&gt; You if you are predestinated, &gt;&gt; you don't have a beginning. Amen. &gt;&gt; But now before the beginning &gt;&gt; already you could see &gt;&gt; and you could hear before the beginning &gt;&gt; out there when the beginning started. You you you were able to see &gt;&gt; the beginning. And so because you were before the beginning, those who were there before the beginning could see the beginning could hear what was spoken there. Amen. That's why to today we are still going to to to read and you'll we will come to a place where it says book of revelation the bride &gt;&gt; and the spirit and the bride &gt;&gt; the spirit and the bride &gt;&gt; say come &gt;&gt; you see &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; the spirit and the bride. &gt;&gt; So when can you trace back where the spirit started to say something? Amen. &gt;&gt; You know as the Bible says of things here it was not so. It was not so from the beginning. Amen. &gt;&gt; There was no divorce. There was no these things from from there because God has no beginning. Now the people who were there, they have seen the beginning. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; These are the people who will come today and say to you what you are doing was not so. &gt;&gt; They have seen it back there. So they know how it should be like. They know what Christianity should be like because they were there. &gt;&gt; They saw it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. They talk about the fallen angels. &gt;&gt; No. And the spirits. Let me close. I'm going to continue reading here. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you something. &gt;&gt; If you find a demon, &gt;&gt; as my prophet says, &gt;&gt; these demons, &gt;&gt; they know better why they were &gt;&gt; they are fallen, but they were there. So they are standing here as let me type to you this for one minute. Here they are standing again I'm saying it and here's a Pharisee and here's a demon. Now you listen who's going to say the right thing? concerning Jesus. Will it be a demon or a Pharisee? A &gt;&gt; demon demon comes and say, "Thou art the son of the living God." &gt;&gt; And they they say next you pastor, you come and give your testimony. Are you Mary's child? &gt;&gt; That is his testimony. &gt;&gt; But the test the testimony of a demon differs. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He says, "Have you come to judge us already?" That that's a demon now. &gt;&gt; And the father say, "I know him. &gt;&gt; His mother is Mary. His father is a carpenter. There &gt;&gt; you see the difference. &gt;&gt; Even it's the same thing today. Don't you see it? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A demon will tell you better of a child of God about the child of God than a so-called Christian brother in the message. If you want to get the truth, &gt;&gt; you call them &gt;&gt; and ask a demon, &gt;&gt; who is this? &gt;&gt; Oh, this one is the son of God. Yeah, he Yeah. But ask a so-called Christian, but not a demon. The demon knows better. &gt;&gt; Can you see it? So, you know, we can't listen to the demons, but if we were allowed for a demon, but but so we're not allowed to go ask demons. &gt;&gt; It says you must cast them out. Yet Jesus Christ says Satan is a liar and the father of it. Now listen, &gt;&gt; but he stood there on the mountain and Satan came to to test him. Now the Bible don't tell us that. Jesus said, Jesus didn't say to him, "I don't talk to Satan." No, he stood there. I said, "Can you see the whole world? &gt;&gt; I have it under my throw yourself down from this mountain. When you wake up, I'll give you the whole thing." &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ was listening. It is written. &gt;&gt; It is written. It is written. He didn't change. You know that &gt;&gt; Jesus Christ says to Satan, &gt;&gt; not Satan. Listening to him talking and says, "It is written." Satan brings another written. If we were like that every time Satan comes to test us we say it is written today even we can say it is revealed. [cheering] Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We shall not worship any other god. We shall not belong to church but to Christ. &gt;&gt; Because church is a woman. Amen. If she's not converted, she loves fish and what what now? It is written. &gt;&gt; It is re today. I can say it is revealed. Can you see it friends? Now today we'll leave &gt;&gt; to take some rounds and back again. &gt;&gt; Then we'll come back again. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Just after six six minutes. Amen. &gt;&gt; A day is a minute to me. &gt;&gt; You see I'm leaving the pulpit. &gt;&gt; But before but before you say we'll be right back here. Okay. &gt;&gt; Pray for me also. &gt;&gt; And God is helping us. Uh something something is happening. &gt;&gt; Yeah, something is happening and very very soon we are going to see the king. Amen. And the people have already started working towards that because he is coming and I come to you and you come to me. Yes. &gt;&gt; So this is happening now. He's coming to us. We are also going to him. We shall meet in the air. &gt;&gt; As we stand up. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. [applause] &gt;&gt; I suggest you put them like this. Yeah. Come on sisters. [music] &gt;&gt; Where are you sister? [music] &gt;&gt; [singing] &gt;&gt; So powerful. [singing and music] [singing and music] [music and singing] [music] Full high.

Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Gracious heavenly father. &gt;&gt; It's a blessing, Father, to be here this morning, especially gracious heavenly father, to hear the mysterious things that were hidden before the foundation of the world. Just a mere mind, Lord, to recognize that we'll be sitting with you and judging. Father, &gt;&gt; to a normal mind is just a farfetched thing. Father, just to think that, Father, you processed us from thyself. Lord, we are your offsprings. We're your children. And your seed that comes from thee. Heavenly Father, thank you for bringing us here and and thank you father for giving us the right direction and for giving us a shepherd, gracious Lord &gt;&gt; that showed us where the green pastures are. and gracious heavenly father for giving us relevant food, &gt;&gt; a ministry that is relevant to the time that we're living in. Father, &gt;&gt; we've been reading scriptures that says there will be groaning, groaning for the manifestations of the sons of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Today we see the prophecy being manifested, Lord. &gt;&gt; And today we see the manifestations of the sons of God. Gracious heaven, our prophet taught us that John the Baptist prophesied about him and ended up pointing him. And when he came, Lord, you came, Father, to manifest what John the Baptist was prophesying about. &gt;&gt; And Father, this morning again, we are seeing the very same thing. The manifestations of all the divine promises, Father, &gt;&gt; especially in this time. Thank you, Father. We raise our hands. We adore thee, Lord. And we will worship thee, Father. And gracious heavenly father, thank you once again to know that when the prophet says, "The word is now in the bride." Father, that is manifested, Lord, even to this morning. Thank you, Father. Bless each and every heart that has a space for these things that were said here and bless our pastor here &gt;&gt; and bless the church and father with the revelation that you have given us. We will manage to see our positions in the new Jerusalem. &gt;&gt; We managed to see our positions Lord Almighty in the word. There was a prophecy that says, "He that overcomemeth, I will give him to eat from the hidden manner." &gt;&gt; Father, we are eating from the hidden manner. And in that manner that you are eating in, Father, you gave us a white stone &gt;&gt; and Father, we could see our name in that white stone. &gt;&gt; We like to thank you, Father. May you bless each and everyone Lord and gracious heavenly father. Thank you once again. We are looking forward for more of these. Thank you father in the precious name of our Lord Jesus Christ [music] we pray.

Gracious almighty father to stand with you. We are thankful because this is Prophet once said that your word will be preached and heavenly father when the names of the believers are called they will respond. Father here they are they have responded to that call of the mighty angel. Father as they are coming to be baptized in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. We say let all the promises of the scriptures be given unto them. Heavenly father we pray for this whole session and the brothers that will be performing the duty. We say let it all happen to bring glory and honor to your name. In Jesus name we pray. Amen. Acts chapter 2 verse 36-39. Acts 2 from verse 36. Therefore, let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God hath made that same Jesus, whom he have crucified, both Lord and Christ. Now, when they heard this, they were pricricked in their heart, and said unto Peter, and to the rest of the apostles, "Men and brethren, what shall we do?" Then Peter said unto them, "Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remissions of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.
