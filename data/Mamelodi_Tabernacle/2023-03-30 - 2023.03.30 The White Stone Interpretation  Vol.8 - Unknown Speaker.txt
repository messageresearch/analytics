Description:
Title: The White Stone Interpretation Vol  8
Preached By Pastor Israel Nkodima on Saturday 30 March 2024 at Leeuwfontein Easter Services.

The Pastor read the following scriptures:

Revelation 2: 17 | Revelation 19: 11-13 | Genesis 13: 14 -15 | Revelation 21:9

The purpose of the sermon was to show the audience about the interpretation of the white stone.

The Angel said to John come up hither and I will show you things to come. Meaning he cannot see things from the position he is. We must make sure when we are sited in here that we are in a position to hear God.

You see things from the place. There are certain things you cannot see from a certain place. People are looking but not from the same place. The seven seals has closed the New Testament. There is no place for the son and daughter of God there. You see it and you read it, but your place is no longer there. When you read it every time it will direct you to the seals.

You can't see the husband while failing to see the wife. The prophet says they are alpha and omega.
If you are one with Christ there is no place of falling away from Christ. And your marriage with Christ did not start on a certain date. But it started back there.

A theophany is a body subject to the word. A theophany has no beginning, it came from the seven rainbow colors. When the word of God speaks, it speaks in you. When brother Branham narrated the story of the squirrel’s sis Hattie said it is nothing but the truth. Brother Branham said she did not say it from here. The gospel preached by the bride is not from here. The Bride of Christ does not join a church because she is one with Christ.

The message is now coming from the pyramid. You cannot come into the dispensation of the seventh seal with the old name. When God gave you a revelation he gave you a name. The new commission is only for the bride of Christ, not for the message church.

If you are predestinated your hearing faculty is your theophany. The ministry comes through revelation...

and it is there it is continuing yesterday I was talking to the children of God about a certain woman who left her usual spot where she normally sits and went to sit next to a certain sister together with her child and things started to happen I was telling the children of God yesterday that now I'm going to look for that child amen amen fear not nothing is going to happen amen amen he even God himself when there was a Lucifer he didn't run away but he he he came down uh with a A Plan of Redemption amen even with us when there is things we don't get scared because what a mighty God we say you will realize that manifestation we are living in the days of manifestations the one who comes from the Devil he or she is going to manifest the devil and the one that comes from God will manifest now let us read the word of God brother amen bless you sir amen can we bow our heads amen amen [Music] [Music] amen [Music] [Music] for [Music] [Music] amen we are standing here because we are eyewitnesses of this great power amen that you have demonstrated through Africa and through the whole world Amen there's nothing that can stand against the message of the hour there's nothing that can stand against the opening of the seven sea today we are standing here Lord to testify and tell Satan that he's powerless his place is the bottomless pit he's already judged he's waiting for that Lake of Fire and with those people that he he has deceived they'll go with him am father we are here standing before you committing this minute Lord in your hand that you may come and use your word amen mightily Lord with a man of a sword Amen in our day father with the word you did that in the days of our precious brother William Maron B that he had a sort and father today we know that that s is the word of God Amen and we know you have come down and gave us power Lord here I'm standing with our pastor through so many years we've been coming around this place father you have demonstrated you have manifested you have expressed your power amen that no Satan no demon can stand father we thank you as you are going to read the word may this word find The Dwelling Place in our hearts sir we ask all these things in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen amen God bless you amen H yes sir amen we're reading Revelation chapter 2 verse 17 he that have an ear let him hear what the spirit sath unto the churches to him that over cometh will I give to it of the Hidden man and will give him a white stone and in the stone a new name written which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it we also reading Revelation Chapter 19 Verse 11-13 and I saw heaven opened and behold a white horse and he that sat upon him was called faithful and true and in righteousness he doth judge and make war his eyes were as a flame of fire and on his head were many crowns and he had a name written that no man knew but he himself and he was cloth with a vure dipped in Blood and his name is called the word of God hallelu we may take our seats amen God bless you amen amen amen amen I'm really happy to greet the children of God from different places and uh I believe I'm in the right place am amen I he you are talking about Easter what is now is it Easter amen okay amen it's good Easter Easter because men the Garden of Eden was placed Eastward amen amen amen that's why we have east and west and brother says east and west have come together amen amen amen now we've seen the book ofs amen we are just going to take the portion that is enough for the time remaining the Lord allows we have pastors will continue tomorrow amen and firstly sly I was something and I found a place where brother Bram was advising people and and now we also take example from him to advise one another now first advice is that us as parents I mean we should not buy our children stuff that makes the devil to infiltrate or get into them amen amen just as the Bible says when the church children of God were coming before the lord the devil also appeared amen amen when preaches the word there's two powers that are working the one is here at the service to work for the devil [Music] and the other one is here to worship God are you aware of that am was telling me she works close to us there you know he says there's a certain Pastor who was telling me something of a certain Church now he says this Pastor said hey nowadays you must be careful in the churches that there is a certain man okay one woman oh she always she used to have a dream then oh this woman would see the devil in the church now he says one day the pastor of that church is but is in a dream went to the devil while he were seated there and he was busy also clapping hands now this one knew him CU others they don't know him they not knowing this is theil this woman says oh is is the pastor who dreamed seeing the devil every Sunday Satan is never absent from the church amen amen because he's at work now this pastor went to him hey how are you my friend now he says so what brings you here oh Pastor you're surprising me now I also have my people in here amen amen so we are sharing here you have yours you comforting yours I also Comfort mine can you see how it happens when we come together there's two [Applause] Gods one has come to comfort his and to make them do his things and other one to bless his people now you must know that there's two gods are in us all right amen yeah so even this morning the brother was telling me about something a child there's a certain brother when I would talk he will say speak Pastor he would actually me don't be afraid speak amen amen because Satan will not scared of him the other time I was talking to another one he was telling me things in the early hours and I was telling him that the devil with us he was defeated now we are the part of the people that defeated him amen amen even now we still defeat him and we still going to defeat him amen amen now let me stop let's look into the word of God God has sent us a prophet I was listening to the points when the pastor was preaching this morning blessed I found myself blessed amen amen because God has given us pastors that knows what they are doing that God actually works through them when you want things to go [Music] wrong work through a pastor that God does not work through him am amen all the time when the pastor comes to the ppit we are expecting from God that he's going to get into the pastor and talk to me amen we have to have p that God can be able to channel his through this P amen amen that's why we are blessed now the scripture say which we take the first part of it by God's grace amen I was reading yesterday in the I found that Revelation 4 John hears the word saying come up and I will show you things to come now actually means before I show you things to come you must take a certain position you will hear me from there amen amen you see even when you are seated in this place sure that you are sitting in a position praise God to listen and hear God Amen so now the brother was saying to me and the voice that said come up here and I will show you it means that for you to see what I'm going to show you you have to change your position you have to come to a place where you can see what I want to you to see amen amen you know things you see things from a place Abraham when God was talking to Abraham when he says to him look from the place amen amen other things you will not be able to see them unless you are at a place to see that's why come and I will show youen amen then we looking at these things brother was saying something like this you'll par me these books of mine they are very old I can't throw them away to me it is still the word of God amen amen when God speaks to Abraham he says to him look from the place where is my [Music] brother all right amen uh Genesis chapter 1 13 13 yes uh Genesis 13:14 and the Lord said unto Abraham after that Lord was separated from him lift up now thine eyes and look from the place where thou art northward and Southward and Eastward and Westward amen for all the land which thou seest to the will I give it and to thy seed forever amen amen amen look up from the place we are going to look at things like that people are looking but not from the same place amen amen God bless you amen now we were reading together with the brothers looking an important thing of the time that we living in we are going to read such things where the servant of God shows us that that the time we are living in the book of the Revelation seven SE the seven seal or the seals have ended the New Testament Testament actually have closed the New Testament amen now I will announce to you that the Testament according to the word of the Prophet amen amen um I'm not saying you should not read the New Testament every time you read it it will still drive you to there is no place there for a son or a daughter yes you read it your place is no longer there you say he says come up and I will show you I can't show you from where you are all right amen now Revelation 21 there he also says ration 21 john9 and there came unto me one of the Seven Angels which had the seven vials full of the seven last plagues and talked with me saying come hither I will show Thee the bride the Lamb's wife amen that's right amen uh meaning you can see the bread of Christ from a church no but he says come then I will show you because the prophet says the bride is Al and Omega amen amen now the bride he says the bride is just like the husband now you can't see the husband while failing to see the bride before you can tell me about the husband tell me about his wife so before you tell me about God H we want to know that's why it says come up brother just read that that that part there please uh you know that the scripture Revelation chapter 4 oh yeah after this I looked and behold a door was opened in heaven and the first voice which I heard was as it were of the trumpet talking with me which said come up hither and I will show the things which must be herea amen amen amen okay the door was open in heaven and the word said come up and I will show you amen amen meaning if he does not come up he will not see that thing amen that's why uh seven Church [Music] ages talks about time shows you time now that's why say come up because when you come to seven now are meaning some people come they end up being in the seventh and that which is [Music] time all right amen now time won't show you the seventh seene it is not that you need to be in a certain place where it is your theop active because today we have the church the message churches but there's there's also the bride of Christ Now The Message Church uh we have so many of them and they differ some say it is R some some say this and some say because they are the message but then the bride this it is God who speaks through the bride amen amen that that's the difference so I told them even somewhere in Africa that we don't belong to a message church we are the bride of Christ Alpha and Omega if the prophet of God says if he is alha and their wife is also if it is not so they are going to if the husband and the wife don't see things or one sees it like this and the other one sees it like this well they are mer naturally but they are not one talking about one that means it's one voice one Revelation that is one but one like I said one cannot divorce itself if they are they are one how can one divorce itself that means it is impossible for divorce they are if you are one with Christ there is no place of you falling away you are one and your marriage they didn't your your marriage with Christ they didn't start on the fourth of April no h it started back then you know the prophet says we'll read that like the seventh seal it started back there we'll read that the will it started back there now the people who were not there they can't understand it they can't hear it amen because it started back there that's why he comes and say you have from your because the has no beginning it came from the seven colors of the and he says is a body subject to the way am amen amen meaning a child of God cannot do anything without hearing from God first amen it say theop is subject is a body subject to the when the word speaks it speaks in you like the the prophet said this that that woman when brother Bram spoke to that woman and about squirrels and that woman said brother this is nothing but the truth and brother Bram says it is because she didn't say it from here amen listen the woman believes that brother Bram H God has created squ when brother spoke and God said how many you want amen you know the partners just like Adam and God God would create something and sent it down to Adam amen amen amen and there is not when it was the way from God to Adam no one could correct the other one they spoke with one way amen amen amen if God created creates something and he brings it to Adam amen amen Adam Adam will exactly say what God has already in you see amen now when that woman when she said brother what you have said is nothing but the truth now brother says it is because she didn't say it from here amen you know the pre the gospel which should be preached by the bride not preach from here because if it is from here then you have H somebody preing that but it should be your husband God to the bride all right amen h I read so let's look at this and you will know it's time that you should know which one is the bride amen because the Bri is something you cannot join you know people join this church lat joins that church but the bride of Christ you don't join any CH no because she is one with the husband amen amen amen now let us look at this uh I've got something in the book here we are going to look at things some things yeah well read H the Lord willing um tomorrow if Hees amen continue um I I I want to read something here that will show show us something after some hours when we meet brother Bram brother says the seventh seal finished the time of the of the church ages okay we we'll read it tomorrow what what he shows what God said to us through brother amen amen he says the seven seal somewhere he says the Seven Seals have closed the New Testament the New Testament that is time it's time amen amen amen you know right now we just want to close the door that God has closed you'll see we'll close it but if you close this one it's only when you have a way through the other one amen amen amen now so we have the six seal opened the six he stops there when he comes to the seven which we we will read it h the seven he says now John how has the seven opened brother say he saw angels because we are going to look into what we call the new commission I know we touched the subject but we didn't get in amen amen so he says now let's start from here the the new the Seven Seals The Testament New Testament amen now how about if I come if I I H announce to you that the New Testament New Testament is closed amen all right now people think that I'm saying it is closed all right amen when the seals were open we entered another Supernatural dispensation amen amen even last night as I was going through some things here that's why everything that we do we first have to connect to connect we have the seventh angel messenger but it says now the six seal was opened by Moses and Elijah and then that's it but when he comes to the seven brother bam saw seven angels coming and they picked him up amen amen then they picked him up into the Pyramid of themselves yeah we look at that because the message now came from within the pyramid pyramid is in this way he he he says H the bride of Christ is shaped like a pyramid we are going to to uh to read them and the church also today is a pyamid pyramid hallu amen now he says the Church of God is shaped like a pyramid now there's so many pyramids here in the world but he say he speaks of one pyramid that pyramid differ from the other pyramid because this pyramid had had something within which could not be found in any other pyramid this this is what we are going to look at itday the white stone now it says the white stone Revelation and then which this white stone could not be seen by any person but when the prophet was put into that pyramid oh we will read it amen beautiful the ministry now is the he says it is the the white stone pyramid not just a pyramid the white stone Pam amen and we we we will see that white stone that's why there it speaks of the white stone heing what does it say just repeat it for me a bit amen uh Revelation chap 2:1 17 amen amen he that haveen ear let him hear what the spirit sayth unto the churches to him that overcometh will I give to it of the Hidden Manner and I will give him a white stone and in the stone a new name written which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it amen right a new [Music] name you can come into this dispensation of the Seven Seals with an old na amen when God gives you a revelation he gave you a name all right amen you see we don't hear the message with this ears but he says youve heard from your well read we'll read that you have a the yeah you are SE here but you have a faculty which is Supernatural that faculty is only active when God [Applause] speaks that's why you can not follow a false Doctrine because hearing is [Applause] AAR you only hear God and there is is no way for you to share any other thing the language your language is the seventh seal Ministry that puts you you we will read hours after this because the the pyramid is the new the new the new commission okay now this new commission you remember as we will come to a place where was put into the Pyramid of the Angels now this commission is only for the bread of Christ not for a mage Church the bride did you notice that why there so many churches uh is got in pieces you know Sunday going around you are going this way when you pass down there the other one is also singing now while you are trying to Che right amen churches yeah and then all these churches now it started also as brother bam says now at what happened there amen it started there but now after that it shaped out the real real one received its own [Music] shape and by receiving this Supernatural shape like you'll hear when we read this uh uh new commission things but you have heard already oh amen amen we are just coming to read what you have thean woman going around saying I know Messiah to put it simple mesiah is coming and when he has come he will tell us now the prophet says this woman she was waiting for that way to be made [Applause] flesh when the first time he received that that weight it was inen amen then there was a time to come the prophet says in your book he says this woman she was waiting for that word to be made flesh meaning that you have you have known Christ but you were waiting for Christ to be made flesh and when he was made flesh and he opened his mouth you recognize amen am but you he says she was waiting for that to be made flesh flesh at first to her it was a word amen amen then she went around saying to the people I know she didn't say hey the preaching yesterday Mah she says I know because sometimes you preach a thing you don't know people can preach a thing they don't know because some has preached about that thing and somebody comes after to repeat now the word don't come by reputation the Revelation now if it is revelation then it it didn't start from there amen amen amen if it is uh you have Christianity and religion amen now religion can put you in some things it is religion just like you hear me or the pastor preaching then you take some notes when your script is full you want to open your church [Music] amen amen but before the pre the pastor preach you had nothing after he has preached you take the word not Revelation no vers the verse it is called the second hand [Applause] gospel uh there was mama that was complaining that she was sick when she was asked what what what can could be I bought second hand clothes from a certain Mama that woman or that woman has Beed me don't buy second [Music] God has spoken amen amen now amen if the way don't come by [Applause] Revelation that's right it it makes you sick all right I was talking to uh a sister is two weeks back uh we're talking about impersonation and uh you know we we've got that i' I've got two books on that subject preached by my Prophet brother B brother amen amen amen you know when we were told there was something in the cycle saying brother is this brother amen amen the more I hate that the more I spoke the name of the prophet of God I spoke about it so for the people to know that as I was speaking to a certain brother no it's a sister she was at my house there that you will never come right with God we were talking about a thing in this way when God speaks even right now as we are here together some will hear God then they will leave this place without any question blessed why because the word has found its [Applause] place the word if the word that you are listening to if it goes to the Head then you have not had God speak the word of God don't come to the Head the the word of God is from the we'll read that as I'm closing here it's true that you have heard what you hear is what you have he what you see what we have have seen it's nothing new to you you will you can only receive a predestinated person can only receive what he has his amen that's why Here Comes um disciples they follow the lord Jesus Christ until he said something and they said it's hard to hear this now there's two people here this one he hears with his ears this one this one he from we read it will uh your your your your hearing faculty if you are predestinated it's your amen amen as we are seated like this one is listening with the other one with this now these people are not together but they are listening both the other one is by the Now by theop he is listening to something he has had already because it says so that's why the prophet says that woman she said mesiah right let me repeat I know the first thing she didn't say I was at the church and the pastor preached about the coming Messiah know that person that's a person who has H from her feel because you hear this one saying baptism is in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you go to the next person he says hey I don't understand this baptism pastor says when you bapti you baptized name of the father name of the son of the Holy Ghost I was talking to asking about it all right then he goes to a a church set Church uh they say uh the Bible says you are baptized be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ then there two things now if it is from the the then you are you will be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ if it is from a denomination which it is from the Bible School you will be baptized not in Christ amen amen in in the name which we don't know that name amen the name of the father Son and Holy Ghost is not the names is the name now father that's his office as he came father son he came to die for us he took the form of man he was called son God am and the Holy Ghost also when after he finished his course with the disciples he went back to heaven in order to come as the holy but the same the same person now that's why it says baptize them now I was talking to a sister I said it is in the name the names now this one picks it but not from the heart pick it up not from the heart but from the head Now The Head and the Heart Is two different things that's why plus with the message now uh you you'll read when we we talk about this my pastor talked about it we look at the this second this new this new commission amen now that you can come you can see the new Commission because the word of God it's not like education people don't sleep studying the whole night Amen to fill up the head because exams are [Music] coming amen amen but with us it says greater is he that is in you am than he that is means when Satan comes to the Head God their heart because to the heart that's where your but to the Head many people I was told many times when people would say no you know Pastor is not educated amen amen do you need to go do you need to go to school in order to preach the gospel and holy GH we baptized in the name of the Father the Son and the Holy Ghost because he a lecture something different there's nothing different will you just hear a lecture okay amen now you are just repeating that thing you in the name of the Lord the name of the father son and uh you go to you get baptized in that manner because it is not from the the it is religion now religion and Christianity two different Christianity that's when you say it from God religion you can say it from the Bible or from your uncle that's different amen a person who says the seven seal is not revealed revealed and the person who says the seven is red two people right amen now this one says the seven seal is not revealed asking when is it going to he say only God knows now later he comes and say this Rapture is close without the seven seal how can the Rapture comes without the seven seed look at those now that's why uh what I have received I cannot exchange for something else Revelation the ministry that comes by Revelation is rolling on but there's a Ministry from another Canal head all right amen now it's two different things here if it is because brother says he speaks of the new Soul uh we'll read it it is in the C the new Soul this for you to receive the seven seventh seal you're going to realize that you are not getting it from an old old school or so the prophet say you receive a New Soul because the seventh SE that's when God brings now not new to you God is not sending you an old thing no if it says the new one that's when it is now that revelation of what you have heard amen amen am because every age we are receiving what we have he if if you didn't hear that and you you are receiving something you didn't receive amen amen that won't work for you because we are talking about eternity now if you are Eternal you live by by by this Eternal Word of [Music] God Eternal Word canot even be corrected it is eternal and one once you have received eternal life nothing can change you you don't join a church because you have you got eternal [Applause] life it's just Eternal that's why when those those I met those Brothers G and so I said to them to him you are my Heil away but yet we are one now what makes us one this new Commission because we'll see it you should be in the pyramid the white stone was in the pyramid not in the church and brother bam that's why he was put into the pyramid that's where the white stone what is the white St all right amen we look at you two have the right a white stone in you because you don't have any faculty but we are going to look into that where the Prophet said H you see now we are here to worship God when I was still at the with the Assemblies of God we were sometimes invited by some from the other denominations and to go at this time like this time of the what you call this time eers some people they decide to go to swim go to this beach amen we're talking about the prophet when he says Sunday we Sunday are again the first day the first day that is Sunday Sunday you don't go get engaged in any other first day you hear one says this Sunday we are actually paying out according to the word of the that person has disrespected the first day all right hey I can hear it first day the first day cour is kicked out then then the marriage comes in why sometimes that's why fall apart because the Resurrection Day our now I also listen from my Prophet the first day Mary Magdalene didn't go for she because the Christ already enteru enter when when did Christ come into you before he was there all the time but when the time arrived then he came in but you you always was being his child before it could even be visible amen before you were born amen amen he knew you he saw you that's why the prophet says WR woman was waiting for that way to be made flesh mean all this time before there was time she was in the message the message was in amen then that's why the prophet says she knew about it she was waiting for it to be made flesh so as now to speak she has known about Mah and when he he has come he will because she has seen that already she was waiting for for the Messiah to come and manifest the thing that she has why the seven SE like that amen amen God amen [Applause] amen our pastor the Lord willing we'll get into the py that's where we [Music] belong sing a for song Pastor to come forth amen I don't know that is the way I should do it here okay [Applause] [Music] sisters [Music] [Music] [Music] amen [Music] thank you very much let's close our eyes
