commission he also speaks of an engine have you seen that the seventh engine spoke of the seventh engine the seventh angel is seventh engine by this seventh one this comes under the new commission of the angels it goes with time over here and we were looking at it specifically all this time pyramid is god's sign can and there came unto me one of the seven angels which had the seven vials full of the seven plates and talked with me saying come heather i will show thee the bride the lamb's wife and what happened carried me away in the spirit to a great and high mountain and he showed me that great city the holy jerusalem amen come here yeah and i will well every body claims to be the bride of christ from where you are come here [Music] [Music] to his class now because outside of this

something coming it looked like it might have been little dots but he said no not more than seven because they were seven of course you know but they were in the shape of a pyramid we are told by the seven messengers that's why in our uh the ministry that god has given us [Music] the seventh angel messenger is responsible and profitable for the interpretation of what's in the pyramids [Music] is [Music] a great city then you go down the entire body [Music] the book of revelation before we pass on here let me check the book of revelation there is something here revelation is it 21 21 21 the
