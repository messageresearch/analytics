[21:05] and as they were eating Jesus Took bread
[21:08] and blessed it and break it and gave it
[21:12] to the disciples and said take it this
[21:16] is my body and he took the cup and gave
[21:19] thanks and gave it to them saying drink
[21:22] eat all of it
[21:24] for this is my blood of the new
[21:26] testament which is shared for many for
[21:30] the remission of sins but I say unto you
[21:33] I will not drink henceforth of this
[21:36] fruit of the vine and to that day when I
[21:39] drink it noon with him in my father's
[21:41] Kingdom
[21:45] 26 26-29
[21:50] which is
[22:30] foreign
[22:37] [Applause]
[22:40] let's take this opportunity
[22:45] as I read from the book of communion
[22:48] itself
[22:58] the prophet says but if you are in
[23:02] agreement then you can commune
[23:15] so that's the way it is when we come to
[23:20] the Lords table
[23:24] s
[23:26] that's mean
[23:28] we that will mean we are in agreement
[23:39] and
[23:41] now
[23:44] he says I would like to apply to explain
[23:47] for a little while
[23:54] we take what we call communion
[24:02] is the bread and the wine
[24:08] now
[24:10] that has been misinterpreted
[24:13] okay
[24:15] [Music]
[24:21] it's not even good to speak of it
[24:30] amen because it has been misinterpreted
[24:40] that has been misinterpreted a
[24:47] misrepresented I read
[24:54] um
[24:54] [Music]
[24:57] okay
[25:00] now we want to
[25:02] to thank the Lord today
[25:06] because all these things were
[25:09] misinterpreted before
[25:11] [Music]
[25:17] Elijah the prophet appeared on the scene
[25:24] according to the scriptures
[25:27] for he shall turn the hearts of the
[25:30] children back to their fathers
[25:37] that's why Paul one day is speaking
[25:45] he spoke of
[25:47] for he said he spoke of the Lord
[25:52] he says
[25:55] it is the god
[25:58] let me repeat his words he says it is
[26:01] the god whom he serve from his
[26:04] forefathers
[26:11] [Music]
[26:14] so I just called the prophet before we
[26:17] proceed yeah
[26:22] communion is I read the book of
[26:26] communion here page 11 communion is to
[26:30] talk
[26:30] to talk to
[26:33] you
[26:35] says
[26:43] I mean community
[26:49] is talking about the word commune
[26:53] let it
[26:55] see
[26:57] is to talk to talk to commune with
[27:00] something that you can speak to and it
[27:04] will speak back to you
[27:10] [Music]
[27:10] um
[27:16] you know the problem today it's when the
[27:20] people speak to God
[27:22] who intent do not speak to them
[27:25] [Applause]
[27:34] amen
[27:36] I believe we know even tonight
[27:42] the god whom we worship
[27:45] is the god whom we can commune with
[27:49] [Applause]
[27:52] you
[27:54] can commune with us
[28:00] God that is the true worship
[28:04] foreign
[28:10] [Applause]
[28:27] I speak to and in turn he speaks to me
[28:31] hey
[28:35] [Applause]
[28:41] you talk to him
[28:46] he also speaks to you
[28:51] hmm
[28:52] and you know this is the end time
[28:57] you hear him when he speaks to you
[29:00] [Applause]
[29:04] I don't know about you
[29:07] I don't know about you when I speak to
[29:10] him
[29:11] I wait for him to speak to me
[29:14] [Applause]
[29:16] [Music]
[29:17] and we were talking as we were coming
[29:20] this way
[29:31] [Applause]
[29:35] and it is only yesterday
[29:38] when I stood up and said now I've got
[29:42] the answer
[29:42] [Applause]
[29:47] Don't Preach if he hasn't spoken to you
[29:51] [Applause]
[29:57] because
[30:00] a preaching is not just to repeat things
[30:06] it's continuity
[30:09] happy
[30:12] like now
[30:14] you know somebody said they were talking
[30:18] to me well
[30:21] as I was told that
[30:25] somebody has taken the pulpit back to
[30:28] brother Brennan
[30:32] foreign
[30:35] it's not according to the scriptures
[30:38] nothing because
[30:39] foreign
[30:46] ministers
[31:01] when I passed away
[31:03] these people will take the message
[31:07] foreign
[31:11] [Applause]
[31:28] yes this is
[31:30] you know I'm not preaching but yesterday
[31:35] I was talking to the brothers on our way
[31:38] coming here
[31:42] that uh they are talking about
[31:47] things that are happening now
[31:54] politically
[31:55] and
[32:00] and they are warning the Christians
[32:11] it is coming to you
[32:15] amen and meaning that
[32:18] the tribulation
[32:21] period is coming to you
[32:26] amen amen and then now but we have a
[32:31] message on that
[32:34] we will look at that
[32:38] but this is just for communion here
[32:47] he says what's he
[32:50] I'm reading the last part of it
[32:53] and then we take communion
[32:58] he says
[33:00] commune is to talk to to
[33:03] commune with something that you can
[33:07] speak to and it will speak back to you
[33:10] communication amen
[33:21] that's why before we used to use like a
[33:25] cold drink and so could drink could
[33:29] drink and what else and bread and all
[33:32] that
[33:33] um
[33:37] we used to do that
[33:40] now that was not communion
[33:47] of the Lord
[33:50] to commune is to talk to
[33:55] is to talk to
[33:57] um
[34:00] to commune with something that that's
[34:03] what we are here for tonight
[34:06] foreign
[34:08] [Applause]
[34:18] [Laughter]
[34:34] [Music]
[34:39] later
[34:41] [Applause]
[35:00] tonight is just for this communion here
[35:04] numbers
[35:07] and it says
[35:10] that's communion
[35:12] I'm trying to say to you this is what we
[35:15] have come for amen
[35:22] and he says
[35:25] a way a wafer that's what they use at
[35:29] the Catholic Church cannot speak back
[35:33] [Music]
[35:38] the real communion
[35:41] is
[35:42] the holy spirit speaking back
[35:46] [Applause]
[35:48] right like like as we think communion
[35:52] like this
[35:58] [Applause]
[36:09] [Applause]
[36:12] when you ask him
[36:15] then he speaks back
[36:18] I want to serve God who can speak back
[36:21] to me
[36:24] not that I just I'm just speaking
[36:27] speaking speaking
[36:37] they brought somebody to my house
[36:40] they brought somebody to my house
[36:43] a woman she couldn't walk or always
[36:49] two weeks back
[36:52] about two weeks back
[36:55] and I even asked some brothers who were
[36:58] with us to go and help to carry the
[37:01] woman into my house

[37:26] and it was hard for heaven to stand up
[37:31] [Applause]
[37:48] [Laughter]

[37:55] returned to fetch her
[38:00] foreign
[38:03] [Applause]
[38:15] [Laughter]
[38:25] [Applause]
[38:34] we went to pray for him
[38:37] [Applause]
[38:38] and said God will do the rest
[38:42] foreign
[38:49] [Music]
[39:00] said
[39:04] he opened the seventh seal and God
[39:08] opened the Seven Seals
[39:11] but he never said anything
[39:13] [Applause]
[39:15] then he said
[39:18] but he opened it
[39:27] but just about his coming or his
[39:31] appearing at the end
[39:36] something will happen there
[39:39] [Applause]

[39:45] answer
