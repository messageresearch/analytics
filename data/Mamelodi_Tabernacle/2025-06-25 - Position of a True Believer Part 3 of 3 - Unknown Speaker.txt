TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] [Music] [Music] Amen. Christ is the anointing. Now, son of man, the son of man back in the church again revealed in human beings, not son of god, but son of man again back in the church. Let me read it again in this place here. some of men back where amen for uh for for for now I read it here page nine then we find after his death burial and resurrection he came on the day of Pentecost son of God before that he was son of men then he came As after after resurrection, he came on the day of Pentecost. He started to be son of man on the day of Pentecost. Before Pentecost, he was son of man. Son of God before Pentecost. Before Pentecost, you are son of God. I I mean son of man. Sorry. Forgive me. But from the day of Pentecost on the day of Pentecost, the Holy Ghost came then he was introduced as sons. Right? Son of God, the Holy Ghost. Now the seven church ages is the work of the Holy Ghost. The prophet tells you The Holy Ghost started the Ephesians church age all the church ages. That's why you have here the holy because this is the work of the Holy Ghost. But the Holy Ghost the Bible says was a teacher. And when the teacher uh h has completed uh has brought a student uh to I'll say majority then he will introduce the people the the the student to the master and say I have done my work here's your Amen. Now, seven church ages, the prophet says you find twins, Isaac and Ishma. Isaac and Jacob and Esau. Jacob is somebody said, you know, Jacob is a suppler and so forth. Then I said, now if you pointed Jacob like this, and you say you are a suppler. God said I love Jacob. I hate Esau. Now this finger points at you as Esau. Right? God said I love Jacob. I don't like Esau. And Esau said you are a suppler. you and God said, "I hate you." Now, twins, twins, twins, twins, twins until the seventh church age. Now, we are not in Laian church age. The Holy Ghost has done its work. That's why in each and every age you hear a saying the he who has an ear, let him hear what the spirit says today. You have seven times admonition. Amen. You hear it here. He who has an ear, let him hear what the spirit says today until the loudian. Now since we are not in Ludishia now which is people people's rights means people's rights that's why you see people are coming with rice rights. I've got the right to do I've got And it's been sanctioned by the governments. Even the children now they've got rights. He absolutely says right right because it's the people's rights. And the Bible says come out of it. [Music] Then don't don't touch their things. Amen. And now the church of God is not in laudician condition of people's rights and what rights and so forth. I tell my children you don't have any rights. Your rights is god godly rights. and godly rights. You shall honor your parents and remember your creator in the days of your youth. That's godly rights. Now lishia means that people's rights. I understand that we are heading for year 2010 and my minister comes and say prostitution and these other things they should be legalized. Brothers don't read these things. Let me they they should legalize these things. Now a prostitution a prostitute she's going to boast of rise. She can stand there naked and you come and say, "Hey, hey, you met my right." That's Laudishia, people's rights. They only want a minister to sanction that 1910 you'll see things 2010 you you'll see things uh because there's some people coming from overseas now they want pleasure. So it's you see now it's football plus around that. I'm glad I'm a child of God. Amen. And they are going to sweep balloons all around the stadium. singing. Condromise. Condromise. Condromise. I'm glad you are quiet now. Yes, you have seven. All right. Now throughout the seven church ages like this, he is the son of son of God throughout the seven church ages. He is not the son of man, the son of God. But Luke 17:30 says 17:30 as it was he shall come again he will he will change his position and when the son of man is revealed again oh my time won't allow me now son of God in our day. Now you are looking for Jesus in a corporal body. Who is this son of God? The son of God in a man. Amen. He will do the same things. And those who knew him will recognize that it's him again. Amen. God is a spirit and those who knew him. Those who were in him when he changed his mask and God was in Jesus to reconcile the world unto him. Those who were in him in spirit, they came around Jesus knowing that that God behind this king. All right. Amen. Now those who knew the Lord Jesus Christ when the third pool they could they knew that Malach Jesus but how he came he was in a man amen to show the pro I won't read these things the prophet says When the was in Moses, Moses was Amen. So while they were looking up praying, Moses was busy calling, "Follow me. Come, [Music] we would find somebody." He would say, "Hey brother, follow me. Amen. Amen. Because the answer was not there. You see? So today it's going to be it's hard for the people. He was a son of God. Changing himself. That's why we are also changing. Changing himself make himself known to his people in to deal through in a different form like the Holy Spirit. Like the Holy Spirit which is God. He came to deal through the church ages. Amen. He came to deal through the church ages the son of God through the Amen. the Holy Spirit and so forth. Amen. But now h a time factor. Then I read again. Uh he was this the son of man, the son of man is now back in the church again revealed in human beings. Not son of God but the son of man. Now let me tell you now Mark 13 says no man knows that day but the father. Why? Because the mediator when he took the book he left the sanctuary. Yeah. This is one of the mysteries there. He left the sanctuary and was no more a mediator. When he left that place to break the seals. Now he broke the seals and uh gave the book to the seventh angel. and to reveal it to the church. He broke the seal and gave it to Moses to deliver them. Moses, he gave him a stick. The seventh angel messenger, he gave him a sword. Now, that sword was a book. That's why now after here the twins were separated that blast. Now selected the people and the people were selected and the seven separated You get what I mean? So the supernatural blessed when the seals were revealed, it shows now supernatural beings throughout the seven church ages. He says God was selecting his people, the carnal and the spiritual. The canal and the spiritual That's why you get the seals now. He broke the seals. Now you read first seal. A white horse rider. Amen. Up to six. Amen. You get what I mean? Everybody can read that. The white horse and this horse and all those hores and so forth. But you know very well that when the seventh seal that is where the problem is. That is the mystery. The seventh seal is the mystery is the one that opened the seals. You get what I mean? These others you can read this unwritten word. Now the unwritten word can only be kicked by a theophony. [Music] So here you part is this exodus exodus. Amen. We are not talking of now your senses. We are talking about your theophony because the seven the seven angel messenger we see time and eternity there. time shall be no more that it didn't talk speak of the end of the world. Your body is time. My body is time. And all this time we were we followed the prophet reading. We we believe the spoken word, the written word, spoken word, the written word. We believe that the the seventh seal is revealed. But when we were confronted and asked what is the seventh seal, no it's revealed, brother. Yeah. But what is it? Because he said nothing about it. He stopped there. Then would say it's revealed as the predestinated people. Then God took the prophet. He took the prophet away at the right time so that the children should be the grown-ups now. Amen. You know Elisha, he followed. That was time. He followed a prophet. The prophet would say, "Let's go. I'm going there. He would say, I'm going with you. But when they reached Jordan, there was a separation of things. Amen. Amen. So he saw Elijah going up and and he said the wagon of the chariot of Israel. Then what happens? He took off the the the tattered garments. and the mantle of Elijah came upon him. Amen. So he came back with the mantle of Elijah and the people looked at him the spirit of Elijah upon Elijah. [Music] Now this is what should happen now. Right. Amen. The prophet, God took his prophet. What the world is looking for is not the history of the prophet, but is that revelation, not the history about the prophet, the mental of Elijah. Amen. Amen. Elisha coming back. Now the what they saw now was the spirit of God working in Elijah. And some others remained with a history because they saw the prophet passing by. But this one followed the prophet until the spirit that was in the prophet was in him. Not the history, but the spirit that was in Elijah. Now the Lord Jesus said, "The spirit dwelleth with you and shall be in you and you shall become witnesses. A witness has the spirit of Jesus. The spirit of Jesus was in them to witness to. All right. So Elisha could come back and say, you are talking about Elijah. Elijah is here. Amen. Amen. He took the Lord Jesus, but the spirit came back on the day of Pentecost. So they locked themselves in fear of the soldiers. But when that that power indwelt them, they opened the doors. Amen. Amen. And they walked down. And Peter stood there with the the keys of the kingdom. Said, "These men are not drunk with wine, but it's a prophecy being fulfilled. For the Lord said, I shall pour my spirit upon all flesh. This is not the fulfillment." So they feared nothing. They started to preach the kingdom. now even to the soldiers and the people they feared before. Amen. That is the God I worship. So this morning we are under the fatherhood. Oh, the true worshippers this morning shall worship the father after he the the the the intens after the the the mediator left the place. Now we are exposed to the father. He took his position again. And as long as there's no mediator, now we are exposed to the father. That's why now he says, no one will know. Only the father. [Applause] Those who will know are subject to the father. Amen. Amen. Isn't he wonderful? Wonderful. Wonderful. Jesus is to me. Counselor, Prince of PC, saving me, keeping me from all sin and shame. Wonderful. [Music] Hallelujah. Amen. Now, I'm through now. Amen. I'm through now. H But listen to what he says here. This is a great age. Amen. Amen. Now, I wonder if you can keep this until until tonight that we are under the fatherhood. Can can you keep that according to the word according to the spoken word says in this great hour he is revealed again the son of man that's why now the son of man in a man the son of man, a prophet. Christ is an inner man. He opened a book and brought it to the seventh man to He opened it, gave it to the son of seventh angel to reveal it to the He broke it. He just opened it and gave it to a man because the book belonged to Adam. It was supposed to be revealed by a man because man was made the God of the earth. That's why you find the seventh seal. The seventh seal. Amen. Amen. H just give me one minute. the seventh seal. Why it is so it's such a terrible thing the people I'll go back again you have you have six now six is Moses and Elijah the the the angel discovered that seal dealing with nature, the destruction of nature is Moses and Elijah. You read it in the Bible. We don't have time for that. Amen. But you look at the seven. Amen. Now God, if you go this way, I will say God and Adam. Amen. Amen. Now God, he made things one, two, six. And he said there was no man. Why the place was vacancy? Because God now this the seventh day was reserved. God created up to the sixth day. Because the seventh day was reserved for another God here. [Applause] Amen. Let us make man in our image. [Music] So now God reserved that day. On the seventh day he created nothing. And he the Bible says there was no man right. So God reserved the servants for an amateur the God of the earth and the god of heaven. So that's why the prophet tells you Eden was the headquarters of his earth. I mean the garden of Eden was the headquarters of his son. So the book was in the son's hands when he fored it. It went back to the original and the original uh he put it on the throne and he was waiting there while while restoring to bring back men again to give men again the qualifications. And this why we have seven church Jesus time of redemption, worship time. But when we come to the seventh age again, then we see a reproduction of things. So the day was reserved for a minor god. Now that's why he opened the seals and he dropped them back to the seventh angel messenger because now instead of Adam, God had to place a man with a sword again, the seventh angel messenger so that to bring that whole thing and tie it back again messenger And the seventh angel messenger, he took the book and he says page 20, standing in the gap. Standing, you understand? Standing in the gap. Adam left the place. So he come in the gap for the operation again. And God broke them, sent them down to the seventh, not to the first, not to the second, but to the seventh to make it a complete thing that that vacancy is closed. [Music] Amen. Amen. Amen. My soul say I was trying to say to you the last thing. Listen uh in the Old Testament he was behind a badger scheme and Israel knew that. So they come and worship knowing that God is behind this. The glory of God was behind the skin. I repeat again, maybe today you'll be happy. You'll accept it and now the glory of God is behind your skin. Amen. Amen. That's right. And the traditions don't see it inside the veil. What was on the inside of the skin back there is now behind skin. Amen. Amen. Let's just stand up. It says John looked beyond the curtain of time and said, "There is John." there. There goes John. There's a song I I like. I'm trying to I have tried to ask the sisters to sing it for where they say I'm asking. I'm saying is your name? You know what I'm talking about. You know that song. Amen. Is your name there? If if your name is there, you're a happy person today. Let's close our eyes. And we're going to ask brother just to offer a word of prayer for for the word. I love him. I love you. The cross [Music] [Applause] to find. [Music] God. [Music] Hallelujah. Most gracious eternal father, what a honor and a privilege, Lord. Hallelujah. No wonder your servant could say that great day, Lord. When it was time for him to speak to the audience about the seventh seal, Lord, he stopped and he said he feel checked. Then he said, "Don't worry. God is going to give it to you at the appointed time. At the right time." He said, "Wait for it." Yes. Almighty God, we want to thank you this afternoon, oh Lord, that you keep your promises. We are now living in that day, Lord.

And we are so happy, Almighty God, that way in the beginning, you put something within your children that at the appointed time when your revelation comes forth, they will be able to sense you, Lord. They will recognize you, Lord. they will know that it's the father revealing himself. We are privileged almighty God that we were not back there in 64 when he stood and said the mighty God unveiled but we are here in 207 when the mighty God is unveiled again from the human.
