[58:00] you'll never marry another woman
[58:06] fella the Bible says
[58:09] the woman was created foreign
[58:38] uh
[58:39] especially this book of Ephesians
[58:44] especially that we are living in the day
[58:46] of
[58:48] destruction of marriages
[58:55] things start with joy but they end up
[59:01] destruction
[59:02] [Music]
[59:03] and there's a reason why
[59:07] we don't do it in the God's way
[59:12] it ends up a destruction
[59:16] amen amen all right now let's go
[59:20] according to God's plan
[59:24] for the true
[59:27] you know when God created
[59:29] man
[59:32] says
[59:33] the woman was created for demand
[59:39] amen amen meaning that your wife
[59:44] is from
[59:50] originally
[59:54] from God
[59:57] created specially for you
[1:00:02] now
[1:00:04] I'll tell you that
[1:00:06] a person like you take uh who was that
[1:00:10] woman there Abraham said was it Rebecca
[1:00:16] Rebecca who was that woman Rebecca
[1:00:24] all right you know how Abraham send out
[1:00:27] the elders in his house
[1:00:32] [Music]
[1:00:36] and he said go and find a wife for my
[1:00:40] son Isaac massage
[1:00:42] [Music]
[1:00:46] uh actually I was not to look for a wife
[1:00:51] that was to find them
[1:00:56] now to find the meant that they that she
[1:01:00] was there already
[1:01:08] [Music]
[1:01:12] amen
[1:01:13] and then when he arrived
[1:01:17] it was at a well
[1:01:20] in the evening time
[1:01:24] the time when women came
[1:01:28] to collect water
[1:01:31] and now
[1:01:34] one other Mysteries of the whole thing
[1:01:40] when he found
[1:01:42] Rebecca
[1:01:46] what time
[1:01:48] in the evening
[1:01:52] you see amen why because in the evening
[1:01:56] time
[1:01:59] that's when she has done all her daily
[1:02:03] duties
[1:02:07] and then if if maybe she went into town
[1:02:14] dressed for going into town
[1:02:18] arriving in the evening time
[1:02:23] you know she she should not be in her
[1:02:26] business

[1:03:20] because what the messenger looked for
[1:03:26] was not A well-dressed woman
[1:03:30] but was a predestinated woman
[1:03:39] who's in the plains of God
[1:03:45] all right
[1:03:48] I wish that thing
[1:03:50] would still remain the same yes
[1:03:57] created wife
[1:04:01] especially for him
[1:04:04] Now you listen before
[1:04:07] [Music]
[1:04:11] that is efficients
[1:04:16] for we are members of his body
[1:04:20] of his flesh
[1:04:22] of his bones
[1:04:25] amen amen do you agree with him
[1:04:29] for this course
[1:04:31] a man leave his father and mother
[1:04:36] and shall be joined unto his wife
[1:04:44] you know the reason why
[1:04:46] it says he shall leave his father and
[1:04:50] mother foreign
[1:04:56] amen
[1:05:03] uh
[1:05:08] he was created
[1:05:10] not born
[1:05:14] Adam was not born
[1:05:17] but was created
[1:05:21] amen okay yes now before he could get
[1:05:26] married
[1:05:28] it says for for this course
[1:05:34] shall a man leave his father
[1:05:40] okay amen
[1:05:42] amen did Adam
[1:05:43] had a father now Adam
[1:05:47] who's his father
[1:05:50] okay
[1:05:52] but fella it was something immediately
[1:05:57] that was coming
[1:06:00] now he shall leave his father and mother
[1:06:04] because originally he had no father in
[1:06:09] mind
[1:06:12] he was created
[1:06:15] all right amen that in the plan of God
[1:06:19] man was not born
[1:06:30] came by permissive permissive will of
[1:06:33] God who
[1:06:38] after the serpent has marked the plan of
[1:06:42] God in the garden
[1:06:46] foreign
[1:07:21] but the merciful god
[1:07:24] came with the law of restoration
[1:07:28] because God cannot be defeated
[1:07:33] all right amen so the law of restoration
[1:07:37] is to restore
[1:07:40] what the devil has marked says
[1:07:44] no for few minutes
[1:07:52] the only way you can marry your wife
[1:07:56] amen
[1:08:05] otherwise you can just marry me
[1:08:09] that's why we have uh
[1:08:13] the marriage officer
[1:08:15] a marriage officer and the divorce court
[1:08:18] clearly
[1:08:21] did we need divorce Quotes
[1:08:25] no it was not so much
[1:08:30] we had only the marriage officers
[1:08:37] and the Lord Jesus says when they asked
[1:08:42] him about you all this
[1:08:44] he said
[1:08:46] Moses because of the hardness of your
[1:08:50] hearts
[1:08:54] he allowed you to
[1:08:56] live your wives and marry another one so
[1:09:00] far
[1:09:10] but because of the hardiness
[1:09:15] say so
[1:09:17] and then now
[1:09:19] but he says but it was not solved
[1:09:24] brother do you know that scripture
[1:09:29] get me that scripture
[1:09:33] it was a question
[1:09:38] start with the question
[1:09:40] what did
[1:09:42] yes
[1:09:46] [Music]
[1:10:05] he said for this question
[1:10:09] through his wife and they try to shall
[1:10:12] be one flesh
[1:10:13] wherefore they
[1:10:15] are normal training but one flesh one
[1:10:19] death of God has spent together
[1:10:22] I mean
[1:10:23] we are still here men shall live is
[1:10:29] the Lord Jesus repeats
[1:10:32] and shall
[1:10:34] shall do I mean
[1:10:40] all right amen now
[1:10:43] it was to his
[1:10:46] not his girlfriend no his wife amen
[1:10:52] because when they were created
[1:10:55] it was it was not a man and girlfriends
[1:10:59] it was men and his wife
[1:11:06] all right now
[1:11:10] they ask a question
[1:11:12] why did Moses read that one
[1:11:25] they are awake
[1:11:27] he said unto them Moses because of the
[1:11:30] happiness of your heart suffered you to
[1:11:33] put away your wives but from the
[1:11:36] beginning it was
[1:11:37] amen right amen you see yeah
[1:11:42] speaking is God himself
[1:11:46] from the beginning
[1:11:48] it was not song Amen
[1:11:54] is after the beginning
[1:11:57] then these things happened
[1:12:00] even Moses had to give out
[1:12:05] a decree a decrease
[1:12:09] all right
[1:12:11] okay now the one who came was now not
[1:12:16] Moses now it won't be a simultaneous
[1:12:19] but the Creator in the form of inner
[1:12:22] body massage
[1:12:25] all right
[1:12:26] no he came but to restore
[1:12:31] that's why the true relationship
[1:12:39] in marriage can only come under the
[1:12:43] seventh seeds
[1:12:50] under the revelation of the seventh sins
[1:12:56] it brings back the it brings them back
[1:13:00] to the original
[1:13:04] is that true amen all right
[1:13:08] uh that's why
[1:13:11] if a young man
[1:13:15] getting married
[1:13:19] without Christ
[1:13:23] his disaster
[1:13:27] do you know that anything that is done
[1:13:30] without the Creator is disasters okay
[1:13:36] [Music]
[1:13:40] because it is not original
[1:13:45] amen amen you know even when going to
[1:13:49] buy things
[1:13:54] we are always looking for Originals
[1:14:00] [Music]
[1:14:03] there is this car that you can buy
[1:14:07] cheap foreign
[1:14:36] foreign
[1:14:40] because
[1:14:42] they tell you that once
[1:14:46] is driven out of the garage next fella
[1:14:50] that's the end you can't return and say
[1:14:54] no it's doing this yes
[1:15:15] [Music]
[1:15:17] call them
[1:15:36] that's I think everybody wants a a a a
[1:15:40] new wife
[1:15:55] I think everybody would love it
[1:16:00] we all want would love to buy a new cars
[1:16:07] because we can't manage
[1:16:09] we end up buying something else
[1:16:15] [Music]
[1:16:22] you don't know about the former owner
[1:16:26] [Music]
[1:16:30] it will come with some things
[1:16:35] maybe you know sometimes
[1:16:38] people after buying a car
[1:16:42] he takes it for sure
[1:16:50] amen amen and then
[1:16:58] then the second owner
[1:17:01] um
[1:17:06] there are things
[1:17:08] contradicting
[1:17:10] because perhaps you come you are a
[1:17:14] Christian
[1:17:15] and then you buy a second
[1:17:20] which went through some things
[1:17:26] it's something very different
[1:17:29] but God wanted us
[1:17:32] always
[1:17:34] wanted us to be
[1:17:37] to get married

[1:18:18] for that course
[1:18:21] uh for this course shall a man leave his
[1:18:25] mother and father
[1:18:31] because originally

[1:18:41] he shall leave his father
[1:18:45] and mother

[1:19:16] mother
[1:19:18] because that is not original
