[1:43:14] and all over the Earth and all over the
[1:43:17] creeping thing that creepeth upon the
[1:43:19] Earth
[1:43:35] so God created a
[1:43:36] man in his own

[1:43:52] Genesis gen Genesis 2:7
[1:43:56] [Music]

[1:44:07] Dust of the
[1:44:10] ground and breathe into his
[1:44:14] no the Breath of

[1:44:20] Soul amen the Lord bless the leading of
[1:44:24] his Hallelujah we can be
[1:44:27] seated amen amen so um as the
[1:44:33] theologians have been
[1:44:37] confused for a long
[1:44:40] time amen amen how many men are
[1:44:44] here as we read how many men are
[1:44:50] there uh-uh there's no one day
[1:44:54] one was
[1:44:56] created the other one was
[1:45:00] formed so how many are there
[1:45:04] two hallelujah amen so there was one
[1:45:07] from
[1:45:10] Heaven
[1:45:12] one and the one who was from the
[1:45:17] corruption these two were
[1:45:21] one they were walking
[1:45:24] together say
[1:45:27] Amen how many are there two the other
[1:45:31] one in the image of
[1:45:35] God the other one from the
[1:45:41] soil how many are there two the other
[1:45:45] one from
[1:45:47] Switzerland the other one from Heaven
[1:45:50] the other one is Zulu
[1:45:53] the other one from Heaven the other one
[1:45:55] is a
[1:45:56] malawian these two were
[1:45:59] [Applause]
[1:46:02] together so these two were
[1:46:05] together the other one from Heaven the
[1:46:08] other one from the
[1:46:09] ground so these two were
[1:46:12] together to make sure the Heavenly
[1:46:16] one was able to
[1:46:19] work because the Heavenly one which was
[1:46:23] a
[1:46:24] theop didn't have
[1:46:26] hands but the one from the
[1:46:30] soil
[1:46:32] have hallelujah amen hallelujah amen
[1:46:37] so hallelujah amen uh you can go to the
[1:46:41] second slide my brother the uh questions
[1:46:44] and answers on
[1:46:45] Hebrews question answers Hebrews that's
[1:46:49] that's in genis
[1:46:50] one one I'm waiting for my are the
[1:46:55] slides
[1:46:57] there yeah that's that's Genesis
[1:47:01] one where he created man in his own
[1:47:05] image which was in a
[1:47:11] theop and in Genesis 2 he made
[1:47:16] Man Out of the Dust of the
[1:47:19] earth which was the human that we know
[1:47:25] Now understand there
[1:47:28] now how many are there
[1:47:32] two but the other one
[1:47:36] was and the theop doesn't
[1:47:41] die the other one was
[1:47:43] from the corruption of the
[1:47:46] earth which was English American malan
[1:47:53] the man we know
[1:47:55] now amen amen hallelujah amen so what
[1:48:00] what did Adam
[1:48:01] [Music]
[1:48:02] loose amen am when he was a
[1:48:06] fop death had no control of
[1:48:14] him when Adam was a
[1:48:17] theop by the time which yes give me that
[1:48:20] one that's fine my brother give me that
[1:48:22] one
[1:48:25] that one which you
[1:48:29] removed yes amen
[1:48:31] so the
[1:48:33] theop if he had a
[1:48:36] theop a spirit death has got no control
[1:48:40] of
[1:48:41] that it had to become fresh that he
[1:48:44] could take a stinger of
[1:48:49] death so what lost that day
[1:48:57] the return back to
[1:49:01] God D in
[1:49:06] sin Adam failed to subject himself to
[1:49:08] the
[1:49:12] word to subject himself to the word of
[1:49:14] the
[1:49:16] [Applause]
[1:49:21] hour save
[1:49:24] Eve Adam lost a part of him which was
[1:49:28] [Applause]
[1:49:31] eternal which was that
[1:49:33] part he
[1:49:36] lost hallelujah amen So Adam was still a
[1:49:40] Son of
[1:49:41] God he didn't lose his
[1:49:45] sunship but he
[1:49:47] lost stand with a word
[1:49:53] amen amen Adam couldn't speak anymore as
[1:49:55] God can
[1:49:58] speak because he had lost
[1:50:00] what his we body is
[1:50:05] the amen so since that time Adam
[1:50:10] lost we found that there has been a work
[1:50:14] of
[1:50:16] restoration to restore the Lost Adam's l
[1:50:24] hallelujah amen so we find that
[1:50:28] David wanted God to be very close to
[1:50:33] him so what did David want to do when he
[1:50:36] want to go to be close to
[1:50:42] him he wanted to build him a
[1:50:44] house so David wanted go to be his
[1:50:47] neighbor
[1:50:54] hallelujah amen David loved God so much
[1:51:00] until he wanted his house to be
[1:51:03] here God house to be
[1:51:05] here so whenever he wants
[1:51:07] God he moves from his house to God's
[1:51:12] house amen amen so uh when God told him
[1:51:17] no you canot build me a
[1:51:20] house but when we come to
[1:51:23] you can put
[1:51:25] the it's good that I should us have the
[1:51:27] slid so that you can have the message
[1:51:29] before I I preach it okay the next slide
[1:51:31] please slide just
[1:51:36] along oh okay yes so David God wanted
[1:51:40] God to be his
[1:51:43] neighbor so Solomon wanted to
[1:51:49] build something which God could dwell in
[1:51:54] but the Bible says he built a
[1:51:58] house God does not D in houses built by
[1:52:01] the hands of
[1:52:06] men hallelujah amen how B the most high
[1:52:10] dwells not in the temples made by hands
[1:52:11] of
[1:52:16] men there is somewhere else where where
[1:52:18] God can
[1:52:21] dwell so when came to the lier
[1:52:24] Jordan when Jesus was
[1:52:27] baptized the next slide uh on the River
[1:52:31] Jordan when Jesus was
[1:52:34] baptized straight
[1:52:36] away the heavens
[1:52:40] opened and he saw the spirit of
[1:52:43] God descending like a
[1:52:45] dove and lighting upon
[1:52:48] him and this
[1:52:51] is what was spoken by
[1:52:57] David saying but the
[1:53:01] body has thou prepared for
[1:53:04] me and a
[1:53:06] voice from
[1:53:08] Heaven
[1:53:11] saying this is my brother
[1:53:15] son in whom I am well
[1:53:18] pred so we see now the Holy Spirit for a
[1:53:23] long time had never come to be in a
[1:53:27] man but now came down to dwell in a
[1:53:32] man the heaven is one of the most
[1:53:36] brother calls it one of the most
[1:53:38] greatest
[1:53:44] events in the message he ye
[1:53:47] him preached in 1957 1957 then you
[1:53:52] brother says you wonder what's the
[1:53:56] matter the greatest event that ever took
[1:53:59] place on
[1:54:01] Earth was when Jesus
[1:54:04] Christ was baptized of
[1:54:07] John when God came to
[1:54:11] Earth or sent his
[1:54:14] son to he represented him as a
[1:54:18] lamb the lamb is the meest of all
[1:54:21] animals
[1:54:25] and he represented
[1:54:27] himself as a dove and the dove is the
[1:54:31] meest of all the beds of
[1:54:34] [Music]
[1:54:37] Heaven that's why the
[1:54:42] heavens and only those two people could
[1:54:45] two species could
[1:54:49] agree John said behold the lamb of God
[1:54:53] that take away the sin of the world and
[1:54:56] I barely could sing the spirit of
[1:54:59] God like
[1:55:01] Ave when the son Dove settled down on
[1:55:04] the
[1:55:07] lamp what did Spirit
[1:55:12] on on a lamb not on a
[1:55:18] dog amen amen not on a god
[1:55:25] on a lamb so there have to be a lamb for
[1:55:29] a dve to settle
[1:55:32] on so a body has to be prepared in such
[1:55:35] a
[1:55:35] way that that body is exactly a
[1:55:39] [Music]
[1:55:41] lamb not a
[1:55:44] dog amen amen you know all the habits of
[1:55:48] a dog
[1:55:54] amen amen
[1:55:56] so when God is doing
[1:55:59] something he
[1:56:02] prepares and I'm telling you the word
[1:56:04] prepare means
[1:56:08] prepare amen amen
[1:56:11] um sometime you find
[1:56:14] people I don't want to take the
[1:56:15] quotation which brother was talking
[1:56:17] about it but I I will tell you
[1:56:19] this uh when
[1:56:23] Jonah on the
[1:56:25] sea the Bible says God
[1:56:29] [Music]
[1:56:31] prepared a
[1:56:34] fish and uh if you say God
[1:56:39] prepared that means god
[1:56:42] prepared you don't have to go and do
[1:56:45] research a lot of people are thinking
[1:56:47] that that fish was a
[1:56:50] shark and then they say it's too
[1:56:53] small have been maybe a
[1:56:57] whale but the whale the mouth of the
[1:56:59] whale is too
[1:57:01] small how Jah go
[1:57:03] through you not reading the Bible
[1:57:06] corlection this not this was not a
[1:57:09] normal
[1:57:11] fish this was a fish which God
[1:57:15] [Applause]
[1:57:19] prepared so people want to take God in
[1:57:25] science sometimes they look at the
[1:57:28] pastor and they say what no no no God
[1:57:31] prepared the pastor for
[1:57:36] you don't research him through
[1:57:40] science
[1:57:43] medicine you know they're doing research
[1:57:45] to see which fish
[1:57:49] swallowed they will never find it well
[1:57:52] that one was
[1:57:56] a which God
[1:57:59] prepared so when God Was
[1:58:02] preparing for the message to be in South
[1:58:05] Africa he also prepared you to be
[1:58:10] here when the message of the hour is
[1:58:15] here some of us are through
[1:58:18] Malawi some are through swana
[1:58:23] but God prepar the
[1:58:28] body we are supposed to prepare a
[1:58:33] body in whom God can dwell
[1:58:41] in amen amen are we preparing a
[1:58:46] church amen amen amen hallelujah amen it
[1:58:50] will be very simple to prepare a church
[1:58:53] for God to come
[1:58:54] [Applause]
[1:58:57] in and the people who be here will not
[1:58:59] be
[1:59:01] you the people who come R and everybody
[1:59:05] else who come here say we for
[1:59:10] going what's your name no no no no you
[1:59:12] cannot get God
[1:59:16] be but when God says
[1:59:20] prepare he ask for something which a
[1:59:22] normal man cannot do
[1:59:28] amen this is not for normal
[1:59:33] man amen amen a normal man canot get rid
[1:59:38] of
[1:59:44] sin hallelujah amen a normal
[1:59:48] man cannot get rid of sin
[1:59:52] God is asking
[1:59:55] us to get rid of
[1:59:58] sin so that he
[2:00:00] himself can dwell in
[2:00:07] us God doesn't like
[2:00:11] politicians everything which you see on
[2:00:14] Earth was prepared for a
[2:00:17] purpose the water which we drink
[2:00:23] the scientists they are wondering how
[2:00:24] did water come on
[2:00:28] Earth they wondering where where did the
[2:00:30] water come
[2:00:31] from because the Earth came as a m
[2:00:43] Rock amen amen hallelujah amen it's only
[2:00:46] now when they discovered
[2:00:49] that on a certain uh on a certain place
[2:00:52] in the
[2:00:55] universe there's a lot of water
[2:00:58] there amen much more than we have on
[2:01:02] Earth as it was spoken by the prophet
[2:01:06] Noah the heavens
[2:01:09] opened and the water came
[2:01:12] down by that time they were doing there
[2:01:15] everything what they were
[2:01:17] doing to to verify Noah
[2:01:23] and Noah didn't worry about
[2:01:25] that Noah ConEd the
[2:01:29] boat according to the way God told
[2:01:34] him amen amen H don't think that the
[2:01:38] people during Noah's
[2:01:41] time were less inent than
[2:01:45] you actually you are less
[2:01:49] intelligent than the people who end the
[2:01:51] days of
[2:01:54] Because unless you explain to
[2:01:57] me how you can cut stones and put them
[2:02:00] in a
[2:02:03] pyramid and they should be able to tell
[2:02:05] you
[2:02:07] time when they when they go into the
[2:02:11] sarcophagus I should say they
[2:02:14] sarcophagus no sophus that means where
[2:02:17] they bu the pharohs okay where they bu
[2:02:20] the pharohs
[2:02:24] the stone which they bued
[2:02:26] in how it was
[2:02:29] cut to fit in that
[2:02:31] tomb you just need a laser
[2:02:38] gun yes amen how to lift that
[2:02:43] stone weighing tons and
[2:02:45] tons go on top of the
[2:02:49] pyramid we don't have the Machinery
[2:02:51] right
[2:02:55] now hallelujah amen because we are
[2:02:58] living in the days of
[2:03:01] Noah you know people
[2:03:04] perhaps you know people perhaps during
[2:03:07] the time
[2:03:08] of built
[2:03:11] boats you remember they had
[2:03:14] Rockets they could shoot them to the
[2:03:18] skies but when it came to the time
[2:03:22] when the flood
[2:03:24] came they didn't
[2:03:30] float
[2:03:34] only
[2:03:37] Noah was made by
[2:03:43] God Only When God can make
[2:03:47] things that's the only thing which you
[2:03:50] work
[2:03:52] when the time
[2:03:54] comes it can work when the time isn't
[2:03:57] there sorry it can work it can
[2:03:59] work yes am so I like the
[2:04:03] message to be God
[2:04:08] constructed with
[2:04:09] scriptures hallelujah amen so when when
[2:04:13] Noah's boat
[2:04:16] floated all their Rockets couldn't
[2:04:19] work because the weather had
[2:04:22] [Applause]
[2:04:25] changed rain had never been seen
[2:04:29] before amen amen hallelujah amen the the
[2:04:33] day the people in the days of
[2:04:36] Noah uh were very very very
[2:04:40] educated
[2:04:42] when as it was in the days of
[2:04:47] Noah he was saying something
[2:04:52] which you know that my brother my sister
[2:04:55] these people were so very
[2:04:59] sophisticated amen amen and the next
[2:05:02] slide if you can check out the pyramids
[2:05:04] of the the coordinates of the
[2:05:08] pyramids uh the how they are
[2:05:11] northward you find that the coordinates
[2:05:14] of the
[2:05:16] pyramids exactly the speed the speed of
[2:05:19] light
[2:05:22] and they are aligned in the star with
[2:05:24] the Stars in
[2:05:28] the and
[2:05:30] mathematically they are aligned with a
[2:05:32] stone H in
[2:05:38] England and you'll been wondering if
[2:05:41] these people were not that
[2:05:43] intelligent how can all these things be
[2:05:45] lined
[2:05:47] up and you can even draw a circle to all
[2:05:50] the way to the pyamid
[2:05:57] yes the pyramids which are in Mexico you
[2:05:58] can draw a line from the pyramids in
[2:06:01] Egypt all the
[2:06:05] way and you see that the main thing
[2:06:07] which was being done
[2:06:09] there was to observe the
[2:06:14] skies and that's why brother said they
[2:06:17] were telling
[2:06:18] no no water there
[2:06:21] where are you getting this story that
[2:06:22] there will be water coming from
[2:06:27] there they were relying on their
[2:06:29] scientific
[2:06:34] research my brother uh in the message is
[2:06:38] the
[2:06:39] Paradox Noah's time Noah's day it was
[2:06:44] the
[2:06:45] Paradox you remember there had been no
[2:06:48] rain on
[2:06:50] Earth the of
[2:06:52] Noah God watered up the Springs so
[2:06:56] forth but Noah began to build an ark
[2:07:00] when there was no evidence that would be
[2:07:02] rain from the
[2:07:08] skies and we are building
[2:07:13] bodies which one
[2:07:17] day amen we going to to go against is
[2:07:21] the force of gravity these bodies which
[2:07:25] you are seeing today we are preparing
[2:07:29] them
[2:07:31] s because one
[2:07:37] day there canot be no scientific
[2:07:41] evidence how he going to do
[2:07:44] [Music]
[2:07:45] it so we are doing the same way Noah did
[2:07:51] what was he doing
[2:07:54] before what was he doing before the
[2:07:57] Paradox ever taken
[2:07:59] place Noah made preparations for
[2:08:02] it so which people are going to

[2:12:40] this
[2:12:42] says give me that one my brother yes
[2:12:45] that one yeah yeah that that one the one
[2:12:48] which you have
[2:12:49] removed that one
[2:12:52] predestination predestination is the is
[2:12:55] the only one that's cons the
[2:13:05] predestinated
[2:13:10] predestinated is the only one that's
[2:13:13] considered in the
[2:13:18] Redemption did you get it let me say it
[2:13:23] again the
[2:13:25] predestinated is the only one that's
[2:13:29] that is considered in
[2:13:34] Redemption it's not that one say hey say
[2:13:36] Jesus is lordus
[2:13:41] Lord because the Bible says not all who
[2:13:45] say Lord Lord is going to
[2:13:49] be but there has to be some
[2:13:54] predestination how do God
[2:13:57] predestinate according to his own good
[2:14:02] will amen amen so only those people who
[2:14:07] are
[2:14:09] predestinated are going to catch this
[2:14:13] word hallelujah amen those who are not
[2:14:17] PR they will not be able to catch this
[2:14:21] come sit with us
[2:14:22] here they will see what is
[2:14:27] happening they will go
[2:14:29] back and shake their
[2:14:32] heads why do you think those people
[2:14:34] believe
[2:14:35] in because in
[2:14:39] them they are not prepared by
[2:14:45] God you
[2:14:47] remember God preped
[2:14:51] from outside you cannot see
[2:14:54] anything because you are a special
[2:15:01] preparation hallelujah amen people can't
[2:15:05] understand
[2:15:06] you you are a special
[2:15:13] [Music]
[2:15:15] preparation amen amen so once you
[2:15:19] prepare the body
[2:15:22] then you become closer to the
[2:15:26] lamb and when you become closer to the
[2:15:29] lamb the more of the spirit comes in
[2:15:33] you the more you move back to where Adam
[2:15:37] moved away
[2:15:43] from hallelujah amen
[2:15:47] hallelujah so when God calls the man
[2:15:53] is not just a
[2:15:54] man he is a special
[2:15:58] [Music]
[2:16:02] preparation amen amen what
[2:16:05] is it's a word

[2:16:15] life where it says the f is a what a
[2:16:19] word body
[2:16:21] hallelujah amen hallelujah amen so and
[2:16:24] the word
[2:16:26] body this body the word body is subject
[2:16:30] to the word of
[2:16:33] God so you are here the pastor is
[2:16:37] preaching but your body is not subject
[2:16:40] to what is
[2:16:42] preaching you must certainly question
[2:16:48] yourself because if you are
[2:16:49] predestinated
[2:16:52] your body should be subject to the
[2:16:59] world hallelujah
[2:17:02] amen theop the let's I want you to have
[2:17:06] this
[2:17:07] quotation now we see the attributes of

[2:17:17] spirit this body is subject to the
[2:17:23] word hallelujah amen what is the body
