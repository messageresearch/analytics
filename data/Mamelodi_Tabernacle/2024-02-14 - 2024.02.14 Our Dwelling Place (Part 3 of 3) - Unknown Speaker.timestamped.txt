[0:01] come she should make a
[0:05] contact and we are not just message
[0:10] believer we had something in
[0:14] us when the seven SE is
[0:17] opened we shall make a
[0:24] contact it's not a matter of hearing
[0:28] being
[0:31] a
[0:34] of
[0:38] iive am that's she a
[0:48] Conta is
[0:51] because the Lord Jesus had one part of
[0:54] [Music]
[0:56] it and the woman had another part
[1:08] you areed
[1:12] to you
[1:15] one with one
[1:17] part so that at the end of
[1:20] time he comes with that one
[1:24] part you know how how the prophet taugh
[1:27] us
[1:28] that
[1:30] one has one
[1:33] part and the other one has one
[1:37] part now it's one
[1:40] thing was T like
[1:44] this so you remain with one
[1:48] part and the thing
[1:51] is no other piece of paper can mat
[1:58] this
[2:06] so now he says well when he
[2:09] met keep your P when he met the
[2:15] woman that's when the two parts
[2:22] connected you know it was coming like
[2:26] this where is your
[2:28] husband
[2:33] and when Touch
[2:35] One you are a
[2:45] proph coming with one
[2:48] part seven Church
[2:53] ages the Lord coming with the Seven
[2:58] Seals amen am and when they
[3:07] connected I'm not saying he's coming I'm
[3:09] saying he's
[3:16] here that's
[3:23] come
[3:28] wonderful
[3:31] you know
[3:33] Elijah Elijah had one
[3:36] part and because he touched
[3:40] elah El had
[3:43] another you know the Bible
[3:45] says
[3:47] El passed by El and
[3:52] touch then
[3:54] El he went and S his livestock he he s
[3:59] his
[4:02] came then he came to
[4:05] elij since that
[4:12] day he touch
[4:18] me and
[4:21] El his
[4:27] following amen amen and would
[4:30] say just remain here the Lord has sent
[4:33] me to
[4:38] Beth now El knowing
[4:41] that there's no way he could match that
[4:54] part amen so so he
[4:58] followed
[5:01] Jord after they Cross
[5:04] Jordan am so he cried
[5:07] out when El
[5:13] left and he said the Chariot of
[5:18] Israel amen he was calling
[5:22] out knowing
[5:24] that there's no way he could match that
[5:28] part
[5:37] that's why if the people come and say
[5:41] things I don't have a
[5:44] problem I just it
[5:51] with
[5:53] amen so now I'm told that
[5:57] now when a
[6:02] died they had the
[6:05] m and there was no one
[6:08] to
[6:22] match
[6:26] this this is the of el
[6:31] then it was wor by
[6:36] elishah anybody here who can elishah is
[6:40] is
[6:41] dead is there anyone that can
[6:47] match you see there was no
[6:52] one that's
[6:54] why
[6:56] brother knew that
[7:00] when he
[7:03] goes God has
[7:06] the
[7:14] toes God bless you amen so
[7:18] today you only have another part if you
[7:21] are
[7:28] predestinated time the pastor comes with
[7:30] the
[7:44] word comes to
[7:48] you amen amen the word don't come to the
[7:53] building word comes to
[7:57] you and when God comes to you
[8:00] you he comes to the
[8:03] heart so something must
[8:08] match that
[8:12] correspond Glory
[8:16] hallelu because there
[8:22] isres amen amen oh the Bible says the
[8:26] people don't know us the world don't
[8:28] know us
[8:31] because never knew
[8:36] him now I want to say
[8:39] today which we will leave it for the
[8:42] next day
[8:45] but come TOS with
[8:48] this says
[8:51] Christ is now made known in the
[8:58] church
[9:04] very well
[9:08] know you know one day I was preaching
[9:11] about light in the
[9:17] light and I said to the church inor that
[9:20] there's something in
[9:24] me but only that sometimes the people
[9:27] don't understand
[9:30] because as the
[9:33] pastors there is something in
[9:36] us apart from
[9:39] us
[9:40] amen and I will say to
[9:43] you that's why I cannot
[9:48] preach unless that other person is
[9:58] activated don't
[10:00] pre I
[10:06] can and
[10:08] today you will never hear the word of

[15:07] Prest the word of
[15:10] God came to
[15:16] joh what did these others
[15:20] preach
[15:23] okay all right you see now and the word
[15:29] of God came to
[15:32] John in the
[15:36] wilderness just as the word of God came
[15:38] to
[15:44] brother was
[15:50] preaching you can name
[15:54] them
[15:57] stilling of
[16:08] God you
[16:10] understand so there were some great
[16:13] things
[16:14] [Music]
[16:16] movements
[16:18] worldwide but the word of
[16:21] God
[16:26] came now you see the
[16:29] now the bride of
[16:31] Christ received the word of
[16:42] God now those who heard John
[16:48] preaching heard the word of
[16:55] God because a couldn't take men to
[17:00] [Music]
[17:04] Jesus you know what when Jesus was
[17:08] walking the streets there in
[17:12] Jerusalem you pass by a
[17:16] synagogue
[17:18] amen and you'll hear them singing in the
[17:23] synagogue amen am Messiah is
[17:27] coming

[18:12] syue sing all those
[18:16] things word of
[18:24] [Applause]
[18:27] God
[18:29] the word of
[18:31] God now the
[18:33] people the pastors
[18:36] now we have few genuine
[18:41] pastors few true
[18:46] pastors the ministry of the seventh
[18:49] angel
[18:53] message they are little
[18:57] El the mle of the
[19:01] Prophet amen because the
[19:06] prophet
[19:08] word theor must car the
[19:14] word amen am nothing
[19:18] else until the sons of the
[19:23] Prophet they said
[19:25] look the spirit of Elijah
[19:29] is upon
[19:31] El so I think it's
[19:33] time that the people should be able to
[19:39] see that
[19:43] was
[19:47] us
[19:48] amen
[19:50] because now not just to refer to
[19:55] brother but it's like this on the day of
[20:00] Pentecost Peter stood up and
[20:04] said these people are not
[20:07] drunk It's a
[20:12] prophecy
[20:14] [Music]
[20:15] proph what you see
[20:18] today noer a
[20:27] prophecy
[20:30] be in
[20:32] the so what the people are looking
[20:36] for
[20:40] of and he

[20:47] the that is the of
[20:50] Christ
[20:52] say the
[20:57] Lord

[21:14] not the prophet came and said this and
[21:16] that and
[21:19] that that's good and
[21:26] what as we said last
[21:30] I think ining I think it
[21:34] was I don't
[21:37] know the lamb took the
[21:42] book from him that
[21:44] said now he walked away with the
[21:50] book now you go to
[21:54] denominations they say hallelujah huj

[22:15] the has to
[22:26] know
[22:35] they just the
[22:39] Hallelujah the next thing is pray
[22:45] L but the
[22:47] bride saw the

[22:56] coming amen because he took the
[23:01] book from theone of
[23:04] God which was in

[23:52] book and restor it back to men
[23:56] again

[24:10] the and praise God for the
[24:15] seven now I
[24:23] have and you know that people are still

[30:01] forget about Sin talking about
[30:10] death before he can touch
[30:13] him must touch the
[30:19] husband you know one
[30:21] day sorry just 3 minutes one
[30:25] day a brother was visiting
[30:28] me so we put them in a
[30:34] bedroom now I was chatting with the
[30:36] brother I was talking with
[30:39] the and the wife was talking with my
[30:47] wife so she decided to go and sleep the
[30:50] wife of the
[30:54] brother now not knowing that the wife of
[30:56] the brother was in the bedroom
[31:02] already I I said to the brother let me
[31:05] show you where to
[31:09] sleep I was leading the brother to the
[31:15] bedroom and known to me that the brother
[31:19] knew that the wife was already asleep in
[31:21] the
[31:26] bedroom
[31:27] now as I tried to open the doors saying
[31:30] to him this will be your
[31:35] bedroom the brother just rush and said
[31:38] it's okay it's
[31:42] okay I want to show
[31:45] [Music]
[31:48] you then I realized after
[31:52] that the brother protected the bride was
[31:55] inside there
[32:06] with the of
[32:11] Christ have you seen
[32:16] how a pregnant
[32:19] woman she become so
[32:22] [Music]
[32:24] special she's well pried
[32:29] and she will start to you know to eat
[32:32] this and not this and
[32:37] that just like the bre of
[32:43] Christ you know we have started to be
[32:45] she has started to be
[32:46] [Music]
[32:52] selective you know she doesn't eat
[32:54] things like fishes from
[33:04] World she's a
[33:07] special because she's
[33:10] carrying a
[33:13] baby so she's very
[33:16] careful in walking and in doing
[33:22] things you will never see her with like
[33:26] this
[33:30] she's very
[33:32] careful I'm talking about the bride of
[33:36] Christ she's very
[33:40] careful she's not
[33:44] confused amen she loves her
[33:48] husband she's always with her
[33:51] husband because says in that condition
[33:57] become so
[34:00] sweet that's why the of Christ is so
[34:04] sweet because the Rapture the Rapture is
[34:07] about to take
[34:10] place that's that's that's where you
[34:14] live that is in your
[34:17] soul and the last thing again he says
[34:20] the same
[34:22] thing is where you
[34:24] live and in the book of the
[34:28] Rapture page he
[34:31] [Music]
[34:32] says down in the
[34:35] soul that's what you
[34:40] are you are what you are and who you are
[34:44] in the
[34:49] soul amen so we thank the
[34:53] Lord that is that place
[34:58] is the soul of
[35:01] man which is God's
[35:06] place and he says in that
[35:10] soul that and and the of
[35:15] God in the human

[35:28] a
[35:34] better if didn't have ears like you
[35:41] here amen am so and he says all
[35:45] that condescended in one
[35:50] thing and brother says he says now you
[35:53] see with the eyes of
[35:55] God
