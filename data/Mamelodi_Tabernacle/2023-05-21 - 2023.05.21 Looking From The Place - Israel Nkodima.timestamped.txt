[31:42] Lord
[31:43] and he looked towards Sodom and Gomorrah
[31:45] and toward all the land of the plane and
[31:48] beheld and low the smoke of the country
[31:50] went up as a smoke of a furnace
[31:57] foreign
[32:09] oh man so

[33:12] and stand where we stood
[33:15] with the Lord
[33:18] [Music]
[33:20] even before feeling the foundation of
[33:24] the world
[33:27] because
[33:31] the Bible says
[33:32] as he has chosen us
[33:38] guy
[33:41] in him come here
[33:43] hey that's something wonderful
[33:50] it reminds me of
[33:52] this part that we
[33:55] we have read
[33:56] um
[33:59] what God does foreign
[34:26] I won't mention what the brother
[34:30] has read out morning
[34:37] that there won't be a service here today
[34:47] if they were supposed to be a human
[34:50] service
[34:53] if they were supposed to be that hello
[35:02] what you have read for us this morning
[35:11] would have been
[35:17] would have been
[35:20] I can't hear you
[35:24] it would have been possible if it was a
[35:27] Human Service okay yes
[35:30] the things that you have
[35:32] already
[35:35] there won't be a service today
[35:40] amen amen
[35:44] you know Lucifer that's why Lucifer
[35:48] Satan even from before
[35:51] foreign
[36:22] it will end up
[36:24] it says in the book of sales
[36:34] the better in this all better that
[36:37] started way back
[36:45] and
[36:48] and then and it says Satan and his
[36:52] angels
[36:55] and then they come to the Earth
[37:00] set in again
[37:04] because if broke all right let me step
[37:08] there
[37:09] but this old battles
[37:13] started way back
[37:16] Beyond Time
[37:20] amen amen but I want you to know that
[37:26] um before
[37:28] it's it started after it come around
[37:42] we
[37:48] existed
[37:49] or we are existing
[37:55] and he is our existence
[38:00] foreign
[38:17] [Music]
[38:36] [Music]
[39:17] the death of our bodies
[39:24] is that right ah man after last weekend
[39:32] [Applause]
[39:34] before last weekend
[39:37] so we thank God
[39:41] now I I want to go to something
[39:45] before we go to our scripture
[39:50] the battle that started way back
[39:56] Beyond Time
[40:01] and
[40:02] and Satan and his angels
[40:05] I kicked out but
[40:09] I'm going back to this the battle
[40:13] started Beyond Time
[40:19] and we will end yeah
[40:27] the reason why the people don't
[40:30] understand
[40:31] like the battle of Armageddon basketball
[40:37] it is because
[40:39] the people who were involved
[40:45] will be involved
[40:49] at the end
[40:52] because that battle that started
[40:55] will end up in the form of the battle of
[40:59] America
[40:59] [Music]
[41:03] will come back to those things
[41:06] because it tells me that all those
[41:10] beings
[41:16] if
[41:33] [Music]
[41:51] hey you were in heaven
[41:55] and you fought against Satan
[42:01] you have won the battle
[42:04] even this money you are winning
[42:11] you are we are not a newcomer
[42:16] what happened is now happening
[42:19] surgery all right
[42:23] before I go back to our scripture
[42:26] the battle that started way back
[42:36] uh Satan and his angels He
[42:41] is now you remember the prophet saying
[42:46] those the Angels there foreign
[43:08] demons
[43:14] they were responsible
[43:17] for the Jews of the death of the Jews
[43:24] because those demons
[43:28] they were responsible
[43:32] as they fought us
[43:45] [Music]
[43:48] and they killed the Jews
[43:52] the demons
[43:58] amen amen now it's going to happen again
[44:10] those demons
[44:12] will be seen again
[44:27] [Applause]
[44:38] I have just a short short
[44:41] something here
[44:42] [Music]
[44:50] because now
[44:52] we are facing the
[44:55] what the prophet spoke of here
[45:02] Arena
[45:05] the Christ
[45:09] he says or
[45:12] Christ
[45:13] there was three and a half years of
[45:16] Christ
[45:20] prophecy
[45:22] for three and a half years
[45:26] it is
[45:31] okay amen and I don't know if it is in
[45:35] this one because
[45:38] yeah I've got page 140
[46:17] it speaks of Satan
[46:21] three and a half years
[46:51] Jesus prophesied for three and a half
[46:53] years
[46:55] foreign
[47:01] [Music]
[47:12] the reason we read this scripture here
[47:15] this morning
[47:18] is that Abraham appeared
[47:22] just before that tribulation
[47:27] and now we are appearing here
[47:32] before the tribulation
[47:37] amen amen now we must look at Abraham
[47:41] at that time when the tribulation
[47:44] was supposed to take place
[47:47] in those days of Abraham
[47:52] stood before the Lord
[47:56] okay now that was now we have here three
[48:01] and a half years
[48:04] We Are The World Is entering
[48:08] [Music]
[48:09] the three and a half years
[48:14] we'll come to that
[48:16] because that is the Tribulation
[48:22] Satan will be given power
[48:24] as the Bible says
[48:32] amen amen and he becomes
[48:36] for three and a half years
[48:42] you will be reminded we are going to
[48:46] bring them and read them
[48:49] and going as far as back to the Battle
[48:53] of America
[48:57] now
[49:04] [Music]
[49:56] um foreign
[50:17] and
[50:19] brother in my book here

[1:01:12] the tribulation wouldn't come without
[1:01:14] Abraham
[1:01:16] being amen
[1:01:19] standing before God that's right
[1:01:26] [Music]
[1:01:28] God would never let anything happen
[1:01:31] without Abraham knowing
[1:01:41] today
[1:01:42] it is the Seed of Abraham
[1:01:55] that's why
[1:01:58] I read description

[1:02:07] read it again Abraham
[1:02:11] God
[1:02:13] and Abraham got up early in the morning
[1:02:16] to the place where he stood before the
[1:02:19] Lord amen amen to the place
[1:02:23] Abraham knew that Abraham
[1:02:29] as he looked into his Supernatural
[1:02:31] calendars
[1:02:34] he knew that the only way for me
[1:02:40] to go forward
[1:02:43] is to Come Back To Where I Stood before
[1:02:49] and the bride of Christ
[1:02:54] or things can be seen
[1:02:58] from where she stood
[1:03:05] yeah as the Bible says yes you as I have
[1:03:10] chosen you before

[1:03:57] it is a world without God
[1:04:02] you know what is tribulation
[1:04:05] that is that is just around the corners
[1:04:09] and maybe you don't know
[1:04:16] but Ibrahim knew
[1:04:20] the destruction
[1:04:21] of that word
[1:04:25] now surely
[1:04:27] we are watching we are seeing the signs
[1:04:31] every day I was with the brothers and
[1:04:36] then we were looking at things
[1:04:39] and uh seeing that now this is the time
[1:04:44] and so we were looking at things
[1:04:48] that were not they never happened before
[1:04:53] but it was only that time
[1:05:00] decided to come back to the place
[1:05:05] where he stood
[1:05:09] amen
[1:05:12] and dwelling the thing is you cannot see
[1:05:16] these things
[1:05:42] all right now
[1:05:57] you will not be foreign
[1:06:29] let me just
[1:06:31] uh
[1:06:33] read something there is
[1:06:41] a tribulation
[1:06:46] after the Rapture
[1:06:49] let's hear the Lord
[1:06:51] speaking both to those that are already
[1:06:54] Beyond
[1:06:57] those left behind us
[1:07:01] Revelation chapter 10.
[1:07:09] Revelation chapter 12. now I want you to
[1:07:12] listen to something here

[1:07:49] heaven now is come salvation and
[1:07:52] strength in the Kingdom of our God and
[1:07:55] the power of His Christ for the accuser
[1:07:57] of our Brethren is cast down which

[1:08:04] and they overcame him by the blood of
[1:08:07] the lamb and by the weight of their
[1:08:09] testimony and they love not their lives
[1:08:12] unto the death therefore rejoice in
[1:08:15] Heavens and neither dwell in them who to
[1:08:19] the Inhibitors of the earth and of the
[1:08:21] sea for the Devil is come down unto you

[1:14:10] before we close
[1:14:14] Satan was cursed out
[1:14:17] according to the Book of Revelation
[1:14:21] let me go back again
[1:14:26] where did you read
[1:14:28] verse 12 verse 12. yeah let's come back
[1:14:32] I'm looking at it here
[1:14:35] verse 12 and what happened
[1:14:39] would you railing
[1:14:41] therefore Rejoice see Heavens any that
[1:14:44] dwell in them woe to the inhabitors of
[1:14:46] the earth and of the sea for the Devil
[1:14:49] is come down unto you having great
[1:14:51] breath because he knoweth that he had
[1:14:54] but a short time
[1:14:56] okay amen
[1:14:58] the devil knows of this coming short
[1:15:01] time
[1:15:04] do you know now we know whatever
[1:15:09] because you should know better than him
[1:15:15] if the devil knows something
[1:15:18] I know the bride should know better
[1:15:25] the devil knows about his short time
[1:15:29] yeah
[1:15:32] okay amen and what happens
[1:15:37] issue
[1:15:43] maybe start again
[1:15:46] Revelation chapter 10 chapter
[1:15:49] foreign
[1:15:55] and I heard a loud voice saying in
[1:15:58] heavenly
[1:16:01] now is come salvation and strength and
[1:16:04] the kingdom of our God and the power of
[1:16:07] His Christ
[1:16:11] for the accuser of our Brethren is cast
[1:16:14] down which accused them before our God
[1:16:16] day and night
[1:16:26] foreign
[1:16:29] and they overcame him by the blood of
[1:16:31] the lamb and by the word of their
[1:16:33] testimony and they love not their lives
[1:16:36] unto the Dead
[1:16:42] therefore rejoice in Heavens and he that
[1:16:45] dwell in them who to the inhabitants of
[1:16:48] the earth and of the sea oh the devil is
[1:16:51] come down unto you amen right amen I
[1:16:54] want it I want just to
[1:16:57] foreign
[1:17:01] rejoice
[1:17:04] but will come with it the prophet puts
[1:17:08] it
[1:17:09] he told me that when I read um
[1:17:16] [Music]
[1:17:20] he is referring
[1:17:23] to the people Kappa that are here but at
[1:17:28] that time we have been raptured
[1:17:35] now the only person who will hear that
[1:17:39] the person who's going in there
[1:17:41] [Music]
[1:17:45] because predestination
[1:17:47] puts these things in you
[1:17:51] they actually happening
[1:17:59] to those who are
[1:18:02] abduced after the Rapture
[1:18:05] and those who remain
[1:18:09] foreign
[1:18:19] that's the difference the only person
[1:18:23] who is going to hear this is the person
[1:18:26] who's going in there
[1:18:29] because as I said it is like a scene
[1:18:33] we are going in the Rapture it's not
[1:18:37] just a preacher I didn't know what it is
[1:18:40] that life that is
[1:18:47] going in there
[1:18:50] but that is
[1:18:53] growing in there
[1:18:55] the people that are going in there you
[1:18:59] know it right now
[1:19:00] because the prophet says
[1:19:06] whoa
[1:19:07] amen it's not just the Rapture is
[1:19:12] but the Rapture is already
[1:19:17] if it is coming then it is
[1:19:26] you're reading the Bible
[1:19:33] that's right oh amen it is like you open
[1:19:40] the Bible for the seat
[1:19:44] the law of growth
[1:19:48] then comes this you take Roots
[1:20:05] um
[1:20:06] Yahoo
[1:20:34] England
[1:20:47] he didn't need to go to England
[1:20:52] that subject it's in the flowers
[1:20:58] [Applause]
[1:21:00] it is
[1:21:05] [Music]
[1:21:12] not every seed bring forth
[1:21:19] I mean
[1:21:21] it is like you see they say
[1:21:24] uh
[1:21:27] teach them
[1:21:31] then I say
[1:21:34] that's why we are not under that law
[1:21:38] I mean the law used to kill them
[1:21:50] and the Lord came and said
[1:21:53] I will now put the law in them
[1:22:00] [Applause]
[1:22:16] the law could not help them
[1:22:19] because it was
[1:22:24] thousands
[1:22:30] I'm going to put the Lord
[1:22:38] so it is the Lord that will operate
[1:22:44] not away from a preacher
[1:22:46] but the planted laws
[1:23:00] to be planted
[1:23:03] haha
[1:23:34] that is in you
[1:23:38] because God don't change
[1:23:45] now if he gave birth to you that you are
[1:23:49] like your father
[1:23:52] [Applause]
[1:23:53] amen amen already you were born with
[1:23:56] that Lord
[1:23:59] the lord gave
[1:24:03] birth that law of life
[1:24:04] now the law of life
[1:24:13] is in the wheat itself
[1:24:18] [Music]
[1:24:19] the Seven Seals
[1:24:22] that's why you come against and this one
[1:24:26] is not revealed that one is
[1:24:30] that one is on the board
[1:24:36] foreign
[1:25:36] not by teaching you
[1:25:44] all right
[1:25:47] oh man we are done and
[1:25:54] and that will close
[1:25:56] Okay amen
[1:25:58] amen

[1:26:48] or produce what is
[1:26:52] inside amen amen

[1:27:05] you understand
