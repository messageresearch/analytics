Description:
Title: The Zodiac Reflection of the Seed of Abraham Vol. 1


This message was preached by Pastor Israel Nkodima on 19 March 2023 at Mamelodi Tabernacle South Africa

The purpose of this sermon was to show the audience about The Zodiac Reflection of the Seed of Abraham. The Pastor read Genesis 13: 14 -18  
14 And the Lord said unto Abram, after that Lot was separated from him, Lift up now thine eyes, and look from the place where thou art northward, and southward, and eastward, and westward: 15 For all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed for ever.
16 And I will make thy seed as the dust of the earth: so that if a man can number the dust of the earth, then shall thy seed also be numbered. 17 Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it; for I will give it unto thee. 18 Then Abram removed his tent, and came and dwelt in the plain of Mamre, which is in Hebron, and built there an altar unto the Lord.

And Genesis 15: 3 - 6   And Abram said, Behold, to me thou hast given no seed: and, lo, one born in my house is mine heir.
4 And, behold, the word of the Lord came unto him, saying, This shall not be thine heir; but he that shall come forth out of thine own bowels shall be thine heir. 5 And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he said unto him, So shall thy seed be. 6 And he believed in the Lord; and he counted it to him for righteousness.

The Pastor showed the audience that Zodiac speaks about the twelve signs and twelve always speaks of the Jews. The prophet speaks of a tree, and said the roots of that tree is the Jewish. 

The three wise men from the east followed the star of his birth. Because their bodies were in obit with the star. They had something within them to see the star. When they lose the sight of the constellation of star they begin to ask the people. But when the star reappeared they continued to follow that star.

meet with the children of God the Eternal Offspring we thank you Lord again this morning from different places of this Earth because the father we are looking forward to arrive at the city and as the prophet says the bride is just like that City amen that's right that's why they set up here on Earth coming up their seven steps to the king's chamber type in the uh is very typical because the bride is like a city so we thank you this morning for healing their sick as it was mentioned that many were played for and they got healed because you are here as the Healer and we are here also as the savior father we see you every time saving Souls that are they are coming to get baptized in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ even this morning for this way the Lord we ask you to bless us father as we are trying to put a foundation to the things you want us to know and their father the things that they were before the foundation of the world were put in place for us as I pray in Jesus Christ's name amen amen you may be seated all right you all know about the zodiac yeah the the Zodiac Zodiac okay but here we are just starting at home I haven't yet given you the title last time I think it's a week ago when I arrived home from the service I went for the book The Invisible Union of the Bride Fitness the invisible Union of the Bride what prompted me to do that was one thing it seems like the people don't hear me when I speak foreign now I've been telling my brother timing again my thoughts it's a title yeah but the people marabad they just can't grasp it is so now that that's the thing now I I checked with the uh invisible Union that maybe my our weights are now invisible to their people foreign the only thing is we are going to talk about uh the Seed of Abraham before maybe we try to preach let me let us look at this then we will preach for a few minutes or just speak for a few minutes we the time comes for us to preach now foreign with some books and trying to find the this Seed of Abraham okay here you are who is the plant who is the morning soon [Music] foreign yes I mean who is the Morning Star Jesus of Nazareth yes one Nazareth the bride wow that ever lived in human flesh I will come and read it to you on the Stars he reflected he himself back to his tasks amen amen we were trying to talk about the who was this who's this man who came for at the birth of Jesus Christ he reflected himself back to the Stars this is what we are coming to where we are going to talk about amen I mean now the Seed of Abraham Abraham in zodiac now I read I read here coming from zodiac zodiac speaks of the 12 signs but wait until we bring it first which is 12 is always Jewish amen amen and then the prophet speaks of a tree and he says the roots are is Jewish is Jewish that's why you say even right now he says the church has kicked him out of the kicked him out foreign and you remember the meeting on Mount Transfiguration it was a great meeting amen amen they're talking about their duties then we say see them appearing during the tribulation period and then when it was a tribulation periodication it was but he was there being introduced activation and we'll come to that from Mount Transfiguration I mean like our said pool is from foreign okay I mean now brother Branham says God created three words you know about those words all right I mean we have read some time back I mean the old timers would know [Music] um foreign [Music] foreign it came from foreign okay give me where he says and will be like the dust of the earth Genesis dating is two different things I mean he spoke of your seeds being like the dance the dust of the Earth and again like the stars of Heaven and the stars and the Stars because the dust speaks of the creation actually creation is not the dust but the creation was put into God but again he says shall be like the stars it was so if you can tell if you can look at the stars you'll see it shall be like those stars but we are coming to that because that it speaks of the zodiac sign your seed all right now here let's read this one and close for the coming foreign [Music] who can be reminded not even reminded but who remember I'm still talking though I'm not preaching I'm just joking amen amen and so William at home do you know that yeah we'll we'll go to the Book of Job see these things the oldest book in the in the Bible the oldest book in the Bible is the prophet tells you he had no bible to read I am a prophet but he could look at the signs that's why the measures the birth of Christ from the first Bible foreign okay foreign [Music] they they got in line with that sign back up analysis it's not just to say hey that's another thing no other person could see now the visibility of the stars but he says there was something else and they started to follow but tomorrow now you watch if that star goes out of the way they ask them people where is he okay now because the people are not part of the Stars they could only read the scriptures just like everybody's preaching them something different you can ask questions about the message exactly what is a different thing from just saying it is the the the constellation would leave them they start to ask their people you know it is just the same thing if you lose the site keep on of the constellations foreign [Music] I mean amen and [Music] like I don't think you even if you can sleep a very deep sleep one day will beat us be goodbye okay maybe God wants me to go Fellowship someone do you have a dream once just like like that boy one said I think I've seen this boy close to a star a cross [Applause] [Music] all right you know I mean that's the same thing with us just show us the way challenge show us the seventh seeds because he started Beyond Time and as we were there with him there was any time show us that the people believe that it was not revealed foreign that's why with the Seven Seas it was big day with them but when it went and the sun in the family dropped the book him and the Lamb of God came and yeah to restore to us and he became the wealthy one yeah because the with one was supposed to um shed his blacks and with family matters so that's why uh by usberg with something else it should be blood and he his own blood and Maria why because it should be the blood of the Kings because once we are saved by the blood of the Kings then we would Trace ourselves back wherever you come from it should be the show me the blood show me the cross then I'll find my way back again okay now I I'm I'm reading this God wrote three Bibles one of them I will tell you what is zodiac dollars in the sky that's the first Bible I'm at home and as I say used to this Bible the Bible in the book forms and all those that we are coming to them amen amen the Pleiades he played this the most beautiful place in zodiac but when God spoke to Abraham he said look up your children will be like what you see but not foreign amen amen his church was just like what he has seen even this morning is just like what he sees he knows and what he has seen that is something that he hasn't met before not even meant but we were in him before the foundation of the world that's why the Bible says [Music] foreign their only language is the mysteries of God that's right this is what they know Satan can never touch them
