[48:54] when I finish with this service.
[48:58] Um my brother will read the scripture
[49:00] for me.
[49:04] Mark chapter 10 from verse 13- 16.
[49:08] And they brought young children to him
[49:10] that he should touch them. And his
[49:13] disciples rebuked those that brought
[49:15] them. But when Jesus saw it, he was much
[49:18] displeased and said unto them, "Suffer
[49:21] the little children to come unto me, and
[49:24] forbid them not, for of such is the
[49:26] kingdom of God.
[49:28] Verily I say unto you, whosoever shall
[49:31] not receive the kingdom of God as a
[49:33] little child, he shall not enter
[49:35] therein." And he took them up in his
[49:38] arms, put his hands upon them, and
[49:40] blessed them. If it pleased Jesus
[49:46] when they brought children unto him,
[49:50] what about me?
[49:53] Then also I will be pleased
[49:57] when this they bring the children
[50:01] because I believe they believe that they
[50:04] are bringing their children to him
[50:10] not to brother
[50:14] but to Christ
[50:17] with with you believing that
[50:22] then God will work
[50:26] then he will bless these children.
[50:30] You see these hands
[50:34] these hands born of a woman.
[50:38] But Jesus has chosen to use these hands
[50:46] to bless these children today.
[50:51] God bless you.

[56:45] spirit of Christ.
[56:49] And if the spirit of Christ was with
[56:52] Elijah,
[56:57] it is still together here.
[57:03] When we say welcome, welcome Holy
[57:06] Spirit.

[59:30] Then we shall read Luke 17:30.
[59:39] as my brother.
[59:44] &gt;&gt; Genesis 18 from verse 1 to4.
[59:48] And the Lord appeared unto him in the
[59:51] plains of Mammor. And he said in the 10
[59:54] door in the heat of the day, and he lift
[59:58] up his eyes and looked
[1:00:00] &gt;&gt; and lo, three men stood by him. And when
[1:00:03] he saw them, he ran to meet them from
[1:00:07] the tent door, and bowed himself towards
[1:00:10] the ground, and said, "My Lord, if now I
[1:00:14] have found favor in thy sight, pass not
[1:00:17] away, I pray thee, from thy servant. Let
[1:00:20] a little water, I pray you, be fetched,
[1:00:24] and wash your feet, and rest yourself
[1:00:27] under the tree." Amen.
[1:00:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:00:29] &gt;&gt; Verse 9. And they said unto him, where
[1:00:33] is Sarah thy wife? And he said, Behold,
[1:00:36] in the tent. And he said, I will
[1:00:39] certainly return unto thee according to
[1:00:42] the time of life. And lo, Sarah, thy
[1:00:45] wife shall have a son. And Sarah had it
[1:00:48] in the tent door which was behind him.
[1:00:51] Now Abraham and Sarah were old and well
[1:00:54] stricken in age, and it ceased to be
[1:00:57] with Sarah after the manner of women.
[1:01:00] Therefore Sarah laughed within herself,
[1:01:03] saying, After I am works old, shall I
[1:01:06] have pleasure, my lord, being old also?
[1:01:09] And the Lord said unto Abraham,
[1:01:12] Wherefore did Sarah love, saying, Shall
[1:01:14] I of shortity bear a child which old? Is
[1:01:19] anything too hard for the Lord? Amen.
[1:01:21] &gt;&gt; At the time appointed, I will return
[1:01:24] unto thee according to the time of life,
[1:01:27] and Sarah shall have a son.
[1:01:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[1:01:32] &gt;&gt; Luke 17:30.
[1:01:38] Luke 17:30.
[1:01:41] Even thus shall it be in the day when
[1:01:45] the son of man is revealed.

[1:05:39] I nearly forget to do that. But
[1:05:41] something said no,
[1:05:44] &gt;&gt; don't go out.
[1:05:47] &gt;&gt; Um
[1:05:48] in the Asia living
[1:05:54] people are trying to imagine
[1:06:01] what should happen.
[1:06:05] They try to manufacture things.
[1:06:11] so that they can be sure that they are
[1:06:14] Christians
[1:06:19] to make sure that they are the bride of
[1:06:21] Jesus Christ.
[1:06:25] But you see the ship to produce wool
[1:06:33] it you cannot you cannot try to force
[1:06:36] it.
[1:06:40] The sheep
[1:06:42] &gt;&gt; must just eat the grass
[1:06:46] and drink water.
[1:06:48] But when the sheep is eating grass
[1:06:54] and drinking water, it is not being that
[1:06:58] because it wants the the wool to come
[1:07:00] out.
[1:07:04] It is life.
[1:07:08] But when it is doing that,
[1:07:11] the wool comes up.
[1:07:14] And when the wool comes out,
[1:07:17] it benefits the farmer.
[1:07:23] And the farmer
[1:07:25] will take the wood
[1:07:28] from the sheep.
[1:07:31] And the sheep something is taken from
[1:07:34] the sheep.
[1:07:36] belongs to the sheep
[1:07:40] to help others.
[1:07:44] Just like a Christian,
[1:07:47] &gt;&gt; we cannot manufacture something
[1:07:51] to show that you are a Christian.
[1:07:55] We cannot say do this,
[1:07:58] do that. If you don't do this, then you
[1:08:02] are not a Christian.
[1:08:05] A Christian
[1:08:06] &gt;&gt; is a Christian
[1:08:09] &gt;&gt; inside.
[1:08:13] He she or he
[1:08:17] is living that life
[1:08:20] because is his
[1:08:24] is not trying to impress somebody.
[1:08:30] No, no, no. Uhuh. Whether somebody is
[1:08:32] impressed or not
[1:08:35] is is his or her life.
[1:08:43] You see, you hear people,
[1:08:46] they say, "I want you to preach the
[1:08:48] seventh seal."
[1:08:51] I want you,
[1:08:54] you must preach the seven.
[1:08:56] They don't know what the seven seal is.
[1:09:01] Amen.
[1:09:03] &gt;&gt; Brother says,
[1:09:04] &gt;&gt; brother,
[1:09:06] &gt;&gt; Christ,
[1:09:07] &gt;&gt; Christ,
[1:09:08] &gt;&gt; let me just read what the the prophet
[1:09:11] says.
[1:09:13] &gt;&gt; He says, Christ is the seals those who
[1:09:17] are revealed.
[1:09:23] He is those seals.
[1:09:26] The revealing of the seals.
[1:09:29] It was revealing Christ.
[1:09:34] &gt;&gt; I'm going to go step by step,
[1:09:39] showing you something
[1:09:42] where we are
[1:09:45] and what is happening
[1:09:48] in this dispensation.
[1:09:51] Amen.
[1:09:53] Because we must know
[1:09:57] where we are.
[1:10:00] The Bible where I have read
[1:10:04] it speaks about God
[1:10:08] appearing to Abraham
[1:10:12] and Abraham
[1:10:14] &gt;&gt; knew that it was God.
[1:10:18] The prophet says, "Abraham saw three
[1:10:22] bowls of water, three balls of fire,
[1:10:28] coming down,
[1:10:30] but immediately
[1:10:33] there was two men coming, three men
[1:10:36] coming."
[1:10:40] And he said
[1:10:42] it was Elohim who said
[1:10:48] he said he made another body
[1:10:52] for himself.
[1:10:54] Amen. Then he made another body for that
[1:10:57] angel and another body for that angel.
[1:11:02] And they went to Abraham. And Abraham
[1:11:05] could know
[1:11:08] that God has visited me.
[1:11:13] Then when he has visited Abraham
[1:11:18] &gt;&gt; and this same God
[1:11:20] who visited Abraham here,
[1:11:23] &gt;&gt; Abraham met him
[1:11:26] when he was from the battle of the
[1:11:29] kings.
[1:11:31] Do you believe that
[1:11:34] Abraham met the same God?
[1:11:38] &gt;&gt; But he was in a Theophony
[1:11:43] and he was called Melkisedc.
[1:11:47] But it is the same God.
[1:11:50] Are you together with me? Here he was in
[1:11:53] flesh.
[1:11:55] But there he was in a Theophony
[1:12:00] and was called Mechisedc.
[1:12:04] In other words, this one here
[1:12:07] &gt;&gt; is MelkiseDC
[1:12:09] &gt;&gt; but in flesh
[1:12:15] the people
[1:12:17] sometimes they know who Melised is.
[1:12:21] They don't know who Melised is.
[1:12:24] Then when Abraham met Melkisedc
[1:12:28] and the prophet says
[1:12:31] we will also because Abraham met him
[1:12:34] &gt;&gt; between the battlefield
[1:12:38] between a battlefield
[1:12:41] and Abraham's home
[1:12:43] in the middle there Abraham met
[1:12:49] he said it it shows
[1:12:52] that we shall meet our
[1:12:58] between our home
[1:13:02] and his home
[1:13:06] between the battlefield
[1:13:09] and our home. Are you together with me?
[1:13:13] Amen. You see um
[1:13:16] we can say potentially
[1:13:20] because we are after
[1:13:25] &gt;&gt; the battle.
[1:13:27] We are beyond that
[1:13:30] if because we are beyond that
[1:13:33] we have to meet
[1:13:37] but we must know who is
[1:13:42] Abraham met him there
[1:13:45] and he met him here.
[1:13:49] Are you together with me? Do you believe
[1:13:52] this man was meedced?
[1:13:56] All
[1:13:57] right.
[1:13:58] &gt;&gt; If you believe that then we shall go on.
[1:14:03] &gt;&gt; This manc
[1:14:06] made a sign.
[1:14:09] &gt;&gt; That sign was a prophetic sign,
[1:14:14] a discernment sign.
[1:14:17] He said, "Your wife
[1:14:21] by the life, by the time of life,
[1:14:25] I will come.
[1:14:26] He will be having a son
[1:14:29] left behind.
[1:14:32] He could discern
[1:14:36] what was in S.
[1:14:39] He was doing the sign,
[1:14:42] a prophetic sign.
[1:14:45] And that sign was the sign of the son of
[1:14:49] man.
[1:14:51] Hey, are you together with us? Ah, don't
[1:14:54] worry.
[1:14:57] But that one
[1:14:59] &gt;&gt; it was a prophetic sign.
[1:15:02] Amen.
[1:15:03] &gt;&gt; That's why
[1:15:05] when
[1:15:07] that
[1:15:07] &gt;&gt; Melkisedc
[1:15:10] came
[1:15:11] and was put on flesh,
[1:15:15] &gt;&gt; he was called
[1:15:18] &gt;&gt; Jesus.
[1:15:19] &gt;&gt; Jesus.
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:20] &gt;&gt; Are you together?
[1:15:23] &gt;&gt; It was the same.
[1:15:26] But now he was made flesh.
[1:15:32] That's why he refused to be called the
[1:15:35] son of Mary.
[1:15:39] He said to you woman,
[1:15:41] he didn't say my mother
[1:15:47] &gt;&gt; because it was that me
[1:15:52] in flesh.
[1:15:54] Amen.
[1:15:54] &gt;&gt; But when he came,
[1:15:57] &gt;&gt; he came as the fulfillment
[1:16:03] &gt;&gt; of Moses
[1:16:06] prophecy
[1:16:09] &gt;&gt; that God will send you a prophet
[1:16:15] like an unto me.
[1:16:19] And when they recognized him,
[1:16:23] they recognized him as a prophet,
[1:16:29] &gt;&gt; the son of man.
[1:16:32] Amen.
[1:16:38] &gt;&gt; Are you together?
[1:16:42] &gt;&gt; He was recognized by the Jews
[1:16:47] &gt;&gt; and the Samaritans.
[1:16:50] not the Gentiles
[1:16:52] because he was not sent to them.
[1:16:57] &gt;&gt; They were not they were not expecting
[1:17:00] the Messiah.
[1:17:02] &gt;&gt; They will not be the son of man.
[1:17:06] But the Jews and the Gentiles were
[1:17:10] expecting the coming of the son of man.
[1:17:16] That's why when they recognize him,
[1:17:21] they recognize him by the sign of
[1:17:24] prophetic sign
[1:17:28] of discernment.
[1:17:31] He said to Nathaniel, "Before Philip
[1:17:34] called you, I saw you. What is that?"
[1:17:39] That is discernment.
[1:17:44] Amen.
[1:17:45] &gt;&gt; Are you are you there?
[1:17:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:51] &gt;&gt; If you're not there, you will come.
[1:17:57] &gt;&gt; It was Nathaniel
[1:17:59] &gt;&gt; called by Philip
[1:18:02] &gt;&gt; and they were Jews.
[1:18:04] Then he went to Samaritan
[1:18:08] in the well there
[1:18:11] when he met that Samaritan woman.
[1:18:15] When he start to tell her
[1:18:20] woman,
[1:18:21] you have six, you have five men.
[1:18:26] The the one you have now,
[1:18:29] which is the sixth one,
[1:18:32] is not yours.
[1:18:35] What sign was that?
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; Discernment.
[1:18:41] &gt;&gt; A prophetic signet.
[1:18:45] &gt;&gt; The sign of the son of man.
[1:18:50] This woman said,
[1:18:53] &gt;&gt; "I perceive
[1:18:55] &gt;&gt; thou art the prophet."
[1:19:01] &gt;&gt; He was the son of man.
[1:19:04] Son of man, the prophet.
[1:19:11] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:19:18] &gt;&gt; Then
[1:19:20] he
[1:19:22] he promised in Luke 17:30,
[1:19:25] &gt;&gt; more Luke 17:30.
[1:19:28] &gt;&gt; I'll skip some of the quotes here.
[1:19:32] you you know them.
[1:19:36] I will skip them. But what I'm talking
[1:19:40] is what the prophet said.
[1:19:44] If you want it, I will tell you.
[1:19:48] But now according to Luke 17:8,
[1:19:51] Luke 17:8 and other scriptures,
[1:19:55] he must reveal himself
[1:19:59] to the Gentiles.
[1:20:01] as a son of man,
[1:20:04] &gt;&gt; the prophet.
[1:20:07] &gt;&gt; Are you together with me?
[1:20:09] &gt;&gt; He must reveal himself
[1:20:12] to the Gentiles
[1:20:14] as the son of man,
[1:20:17] the prophet.
[1:20:19] Amen.
[1:20:23] &gt;&gt; You must know
[1:20:26] when he revealed himself to Abraham
[1:20:28] there
[1:20:31] Because the prophet said he must reveal
[1:20:35] himself to the gentile
[1:20:38] just like he revealed himself
[1:20:42] to Abraham. Amen. Because Abraham was
[1:20:45] waiting for the promised son
[1:20:50] and we gentile
[1:20:52] we are waiting for our promised son.
[1:20:56] Our
[1:20:58] promised son is the rapture.
[1:21:03] Amen.
[1:21:04] &gt;&gt; Because we are we're going to be born.
[1:21:08] &gt;&gt; We're going to be born.
[1:21:11] Amen. Oh,
[1:21:12] &gt;&gt; my son is doubting what I'm saying.
[1:21:14] &gt;&gt; Amen. We're going to be born because
[1:21:17] we're going to come out of this thing
[1:21:22] and get another body
[1:21:26] born out of this one.
[1:21:29] This is a imperfect body
[1:21:39] before Abraham Abraham
[1:21:42] &gt;&gt; received that promise.
[1:21:45] There came the confirmation.
[1:21:51] &gt;&gt; Confirmation was brought by Elohim
[1:21:57] when he showed them
[1:22:00] &gt;&gt; a prophetic signet.
[1:22:04] Amen.
[1:22:06] &gt;&gt; Are you together with me?
[1:22:09] Then after that,
[1:22:11] that was the last sign
[1:22:16] which Abraham and Sarah had
[1:22:22] before they received their promised son.
[1:22:30] They had that sign.
[1:22:33] Which sign?
[1:22:38] &gt;&gt; The sign of discernment.
[1:22:42] Amen.
[1:22:43] &gt;&gt; A prophetic sign.
[1:22:47] And after that sign,
[1:22:50] it was the last sign.
[1:22:55] After that sign, which was the last
[1:22:58] sign,
[1:23:01] &gt;&gt; Abraham and Sarah's body
[1:23:06] changed.
[1:23:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:23:17] I don't know
[1:23:19] &gt;&gt; if it was you
[1:23:22] the reb would have manufactur something
[1:23:30] the word itself
[1:23:33] it will manufacture something
[1:23:39] not you are saying
[1:23:42] not what you
[1:23:45] Not what you think
[1:23:48] by the way itself.
[1:23:53] If it is if it is said by him
[1:23:58] that word
[1:24:00] will start to do his work.
[1:24:07] It it wasn't something they have drink.
[1:24:14] something they've washed themselves.
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; They wait.
[1:24:22] Amen.
[1:24:23] &gt;&gt; I'm coming
[1:24:26] finish
[1:24:35] and their bodies
[1:24:37] started to change.
[1:24:40] I don't think they even feel when their
[1:24:44] bodies were changing.
[1:24:49] What is what is happening?
[1:24:54] &gt;&gt; But when they were going to that king
[1:24:57] there,
[1:25:00] that king,
[1:25:03] &gt;&gt; that king when
[1:25:06] he looked at Sarah and Abraham
[1:25:11] He saw two, [singing and music]
[1:25:13] a young man and a young lady.
[1:25:18] He said, "Yeah,
[1:25:21] &gt;&gt; what is your relationship with?"
[1:25:25] He wanted this young lady
[1:25:29] and this lady I believe
[1:25:33] was even greater than the mother of this
[1:25:35] king.
[1:25:42] But because now
[1:25:44] something is working within.
[1:25:50] If we are the seed of Abraham,
[1:25:54] we must expect something.
[1:26:01] Glory to God.
[1:26:04] Amen.
[1:26:06] &gt;&gt; Let me just read something here but I
[1:26:09] will come and read it again and again
[1:26:11] and again. Amen.
[1:26:15] But you know it.
[1:26:18] I just read.
[1:26:20] &gt;&gt; But you know
[1:26:23] in this book two is the scene.
[1:26:28] You must you must understand that I said
[1:26:33] it was the last sign.
[1:26:39] After that
[1:26:41] what happened?
[1:26:43] Changing of body,
[1:26:46] pregnancy,
[1:26:48] birth of Isaac.
[1:26:53] After that,
[1:26:54] after that last,
[1:26:58] changing of body,
[1:27:00] pregnancy
[1:27:02] and birth of Isaac.
[1:27:06] Hallelujah.
[1:27:08] But let me read for you here.
[1:27:13] &gt;&gt; It says here in this book, true is a
[1:27:16] seal. I see if they have got it there,
[1:27:19] they will flush it. If they don't
[1:27:24] seal, I'm going to read page 142. It
[1:27:28] says here
[1:27:32] &gt;&gt; now I preach here one time and told you
[1:27:35] that God turned them back to young men
[1:27:38] and woman
[1:27:45] turn them back
[1:27:47] to young man and woman
[1:27:52] to prove it.
[1:27:54] When they went down,
[1:27:57] they took a little trip and went down to
[1:28:00] Gerbalik,
[1:28:06] &gt;&gt; the Philistine king,
[1:28:09] &gt;&gt; fell in love with Sarah
[1:28:12] and wanted to marry her.
[1:28:16] Of course, she was young,
[1:28:19] a young woman,
[1:28:22] beautiful.
[1:28:24] Notice he had to do something.
[1:28:28] He had to change her.
[1:28:33] When he said he had to do something,
[1:28:36] he mean God
[1:28:39] God had to do something.
[1:28:43] This time is the time of resting.
[1:28:50] &gt;&gt; I will tell you,
[1:28:55] &gt;&gt; he had to do something.
[1:28:58] He had to change her.
[1:29:01] He didn't just put her back to a young
[1:29:04] man and woman.
[1:29:09] Him and her.
[1:29:12] He didn't do that because if if they
[1:29:16] would the same thing would have existed.
[1:29:24] Let me say something.
[1:29:27] It means if he had changed them to a
[1:29:29] young man
[1:29:33] and young woman.
[1:29:36] Abraham Abraham
[1:29:37] &gt;&gt; married Sarah when she was young.
[1:29:44] say she was about she was about 18
[1:29:48] years
[1:29:50] she he married her there
[1:29:54] and if God could turn her back to that
[1:30:02] he will be a young woman
[1:30:05] but barren
[1:30:10] But God, he must not he he had to change
[1:30:15] even the inside.
[1:30:22] That's why he had to change you
[1:30:28] from the inside.
[1:30:32] Amen. Brother says
[1:30:35] &gt;&gt; you know I don't know there is a certain
[1:30:39] thing called the cockab something which
[1:30:46] it is sticky
[1:30:49] some some thongs outside.
[1:30:54] He said if in that
[1:30:58] if there can be a wit seat
[1:31:05] When time comes
[1:31:08] the coar will disappear
[1:31:13] because the wheat seed will come.
[1:31:17] He said you are a coar
[1:31:21] you are sticky.
[1:31:26] But if inside you
[1:31:29] there is a seat,
[1:31:33] a wheat seat,
[1:31:35] you see inside that cockab
[1:31:40] which was Jacob
[1:31:43] there was a wheat seat.
[1:31:48] But that
[1:31:51] it was sticky.
[1:31:53] Okay. stealing.
[1:31:59] &gt;&gt; But the time came
[1:32:02] when that seat which was inside there
[1:32:06] [clears throat] came out
[1:32:10] that coar
[1:32:13] disappeared.
[1:32:16] He had he had to change them from let me
[1:32:19] just read.
[1:32:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:32:23] We said here
[1:32:26] if he had changed them
[1:32:31] outside only
[1:32:33] the same thing would have existed
[1:32:38] because he married her when he was about
[1:32:41] 16. They say 16 years.
[1:32:47] He was just a young man.
[1:32:50] They lived their life with no ch
[1:32:53] children.
[1:32:55] If he just said them back, well, they
[1:32:57] would just done the same thing.
[1:33:02] But he had to do something different.
[1:33:07] He had to them
[1:33:10] so that they could have this promised
[1:33:13] son.
[1:33:17] The promised son they was going to
[1:33:19] receive.
[1:33:22] But he had to change their whole system
[1:33:29] and turn them back young
[1:33:33] and change them to receive the son.
[1:33:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:43] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. That was the last sign
[1:33:49] to Abraham.
[1:33:52] It was the prophetic sign.
[1:33:56] &gt;&gt; And I said
[1:33:59] that because
[1:34:02] he had to appear
[1:34:07] to the Gentiles
[1:34:10] with the same sight.
[1:34:12] Amen. Amen.
[1:34:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:16] &gt;&gt; And if it is the same side,
[1:34:20] &gt;&gt; it will be the same the last side
[1:34:26] because we are the royal seed of
[1:34:28] Abraham.
[1:34:33] If our father has received that sign,
[1:34:37] we must receive the same.
[1:34:48] Let me uh read something for you here.
[1:34:57] &gt;&gt; He has to reveal himself to us
[1:35:04] the same way.
[1:35:08] Let me just read this to you.
[1:35:12] He came as a son of man, a prophet
[1:35:20] because that fulfills the scripture
[1:35:22] Moses said.
[1:35:28] So he had to come according to the
[1:35:30] scripture
[1:35:34] a prophet.
[1:35:36] He never called himself son of God.
[1:35:41] He called himself son of man
[1:35:45] but he is but he through the church ages
[1:35:49] now
[1:35:52] he has been the son of god
[1:35:55] in the millennium in the millennium he
[1:35:59] will be the son of David
[1:36:02] sitting on David's throne
[1:36:05] but between this time
[1:36:08] we find out by the scripture.
[1:36:12] He is to reveal himself again.
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; A son of man,
[1:36:20] &gt;&gt; the prophet
[1:36:22] &gt;&gt; Melkisedc.
[1:36:23] &gt;&gt; Melisedc
[1:36:26] are you? Are you here?
[1:36:29] &gt;&gt; All right. If you are here, let me read
[1:36:30] another one. The old ball. I want to
[1:36:32] read the odd ball here.
[1:36:38] We believe that God is to be manifested
[1:36:40] in the last days
[1:36:44] among his people
[1:36:46] to the elect seat
[1:36:49] according to the Bible
[1:36:52] in the form of prophet.
[1:36:57] Amen.
[1:36:58] &gt;&gt; In other words to the gentile.
[1:37:02] He had to reveal himself.
[1:37:07] in the form of a prophet.
[1:37:10] That is exactly with the word.
[1:37:14] Not the man, not that man is God,
[1:37:20] but the gift
[1:37:22] is God.
[1:37:24] In other words, when he revealed himself
[1:37:26] to us
[1:37:30] in a man as a prophet
[1:37:34] is not that that man is God,
[1:37:38] but that the gift is God.
[1:37:42] Amen.
[1:37:44] We know that he has revealed himself
[1:37:48] &gt;&gt; to us.
[1:37:52] But can I show you something again?
[1:37:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:57] &gt;&gt; He has already revealed himself to us.
[1:38:02] He revealed as he revealed him like he
[1:38:05] revealed himself to Abraham.
[1:38:10] Do you believe that?
[1:38:12] If you don't believe it,
[1:38:14] let me prove it.
[1:38:20] I prove it
[1:38:23] &gt;&gt; that he has revealed himself to us
[1:38:28] &gt;&gt; just like he revealed to Abraham.
[1:38:32] I said that was the last sign.
[1:38:37] And if he has revealed to himself to us
[1:38:42] like he reveals it to Abraham,
[1:38:46] it is the answer
[1:38:50] then what must we expect?
[1:38:55] this book uh the the I think the
[1:38:58] brothers here will flush it is uh these
[1:39:02] the scriptures for faith.
[1:39:07] &gt;&gt; Listen here brothers and sisters
[1:39:10] &gt;&gt; and the elders
[1:39:14] &gt;&gt; page 252
[1:39:18] not page paragraph
[1:39:21] &gt;&gt; page 29.
[1:39:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:24] Brother turns his back to the
[1:39:26] congregation
[1:39:31] like this.
[1:39:34] Amen.
[1:39:38] &gt;&gt; And he sat.
[1:39:40] &gt;&gt; Here is a lady sitting right back here
[1:39:46] behind me.
[1:39:50] Hear what he said?
[1:39:55] Amen.
[1:39:58] Stand like this.
[1:40:01] He said, "Here is a lady
[1:40:06] standing behind me.
[1:40:09] She's like Sara."
[1:40:15] &gt;&gt; Who was doing that?
[1:40:18] Amen.
[1:40:20] &gt;&gt; It was Elohim.
[1:40:22] Elohim.
[1:40:25] They said the man was not a god
[1:40:32] but the gift
[1:40:34] was God.
[1:40:39] He was manifesting
[1:40:43] the last sign
[1:40:48] to the royal seed of Abraham.
[1:40:52] He said you are stand you are behind me
[1:40:58] was in the tent.
[1:41:03] She said she she is praying for a
[1:41:06] daughter.
[1:41:11] Stand up.
[1:41:14] The daughter is not here.
[1:41:19] What was this?
[1:41:22] &gt;&gt; It was the sign. It was the
[1:41:25] manifestation of Luke 17:8.
[1:41:30] Luke 17:8. When the son of man,
[1:41:35] reveal himself.
[1:41:37] He revealed himself.
[1:41:40] What? What do you want?
[1:41:42] &gt;&gt; What do you want, church?
[1:41:47] Because he has revealed,
[1:41:52] he has revealed, he has made the sign
[1:41:56] of Elohim
[1:41:59] when he was with Sarah and Abraham
[1:42:01] there.
[1:42:03] He had showed us that sign
[1:42:07] and that was the last sign.
[1:42:13] I don't know what you
[1:42:21] perhaps you want all night prayer
[1:42:27] perhaps
[1:42:30] you want you want fasting 30 days
[1:42:36] perhaps Abraham and Sarah
[1:42:39] after they've received that descendment
[1:42:41] Perhaps
[1:42:44] they they fasted.
[1:42:49] Perhaps it's the way you think.
[1:42:53] But the scripture
[1:42:55] they didn't do that.
[1:42:58] Amen. But the weight
[1:43:02] was in
[1:43:10] that weight which was in
[1:43:14] did his work.
[1:43:21] Hallelujah.
[1:43:23] He don't need your help.
[1:43:31] You can go to
[1:43:36] &gt;&gt; they will help you.
[1:43:40] They'll give you chance to jump
[1:43:49] to manufacture
[1:43:52] to show that you have the spirit.
[1:44:00] Let me read this one here.
[1:44:03] I am about to finish. Don't worry.
[1:44:06] Yeah.
[1:44:09] &gt;&gt; 194
[1:44:10] &gt;&gt; CO par
[1:44:13] 963.
[1:44:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:17] &gt;&gt; And what was the last sign that they had
[1:44:20] before that promise?
[1:44:27] They had waited on for this years.
[1:44:32] Was God standing in the form of man?
[1:44:40] The last to Abraham and
[1:44:44] it was God the form of man.
[1:44:49] &gt;&gt; What was your last sign?
[1:44:56] It was God
[1:44:58] standing in the form of
[1:45:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. Glory to God.
[1:45:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:08] &gt;&gt; Who could descend the thoughts that was
[1:45:10] in
[1:45:15] the church
[1:45:18] representing the church?
[1:45:21] Immediately after that,
[1:45:24] she changed back to a young man.
[1:45:30] Brother says,
[1:45:32] &gt;&gt; "I believe you are seeing the last thing
[1:45:38] that will happen to the church before
[1:45:41] the rapture.
[1:45:45] You are seeing
[1:45:48] the last thing."
[1:45:50] He was telling these people,
[1:45:53] I am telling you,
[1:45:55] &gt;&gt; you have seen
[1:45:58] Amen.
[1:45:59] &gt;&gt; You have seen the last thing.
[1:46:05] Amen.
[1:46:05] &gt;&gt; That will happen before the rapture.
[1:46:09] &gt;&gt; That is exactly I believe it.
[1:46:14] Leing
[1:46:16] the rain is over.
[1:46:21] &gt;&gt; What does the rain represent?
[1:46:25] The Holy Spirit.
[1:46:28] Amen.
[1:46:28] &gt;&gt; The rain is over.
[1:46:34] &gt;&gt; If you want the Holy Spirit,
[1:46:37] &gt;&gt; go to the mountain.
[1:46:45] But I tell you,
[1:46:48] will come with the spirit of the
[1:46:50] mountain.
[1:47:02] Are you with me church?
[1:47:08] &gt;&gt; Let me say something here.
[1:47:12] Um
[1:47:16] after that last sign,
[1:47:20] &gt;&gt; I said the following happened.
[1:47:23] The following happened,
[1:47:27] change of body,
[1:47:29] pregnancy,
[1:47:31] birth of Isaac.
[1:47:34] Where are we now?
[1:47:40] We are at the stage of pregnancy
[1:47:48] &gt;&gt; because
[1:47:50] brother Brenham said
[1:47:52] the weight is in the bread
[1:47:58] just like it was in Mary.
[1:48:04] What did the word do in Mary?
[1:48:08] He said the weight became blood.
[1:48:13] Amen.
[1:48:15] Now the weight is in the bride.
[1:48:20] Brothers, let me just read something
[1:48:22] here.
[1:48:25] um is
[1:48:27] you know it I just repeat it
[1:48:34] &gt;&gt; uh page
[1:48:36] 14
[1:48:38] it says here paragraph 246
[1:48:43] we cannot receive the promised son
[1:48:49] &gt;&gt; that is promised us today
[1:48:54] &gt;&gt; in this Buddhist that we live in
[1:48:58] these bodies are a sin.
[1:49:03] Let me read 248.
[1:49:06] &gt;&gt; It is not this outside
[1:49:09] which is see man.
[1:49:15] This it this is subject to death.
[1:49:21] It will die.
[1:49:23] But the inside part of you
[1:49:27] down in there, down in here,
[1:49:31] inside that is the person that cannot
[1:49:34] die.
[1:49:37] And that is the person
[1:49:40] that that the new life starts from.
[1:49:45] He said it builds another person
[1:49:50] in the image of this person you are
[1:49:56] and around that life.
[1:49:59] In other words
[1:50:01] inside you
[1:50:04] something is formed.
[1:50:08] He says here so potentially it is in
[1:50:12] here.
[1:50:15] What is it? The wait promised before the
[1:50:18] foundation of the world
[1:50:22] around around there.
[1:50:25] This only reflect the negative
[1:50:30] that will reflect the positive.
[1:50:34] The weight and the same thing
[1:50:38] or the translation of the bride
[1:50:41] will be the same thing.
[1:50:44] The way that is in you,
[1:50:46] the body will materialize
[1:50:52] that word.
[1:50:54] And the same did by
[1:51:00] the word that is in you.
[1:51:05] What is in you
[1:51:10] this age?
[1:51:12] we are living in has got its message.
[1:51:19] Amen.
[1:51:20] It's pass the denomination.
[1:51:24] That's why some of our brothers
[1:51:28] they try they try to scroll
[1:51:32] to to reach that
[1:51:36] because it has it has moved.
[1:51:41] You cannot you cannot try to think about
[1:51:44] it.
[1:51:47] It has moved from your mind.
[1:51:51] It is upside there.
[1:51:56] This age we are living in
[1:51:59] is another age.
[1:52:03] It has its message
[1:52:07] and the prophet says
[1:52:09] the message it is the next announcement.
[1:52:17] If it is the next
[1:52:20] was the first
[1:52:22] this one is the next.
[1:52:25] Amen. You must know the first then you
[1:52:28] know the next.
[1:52:31] Amen. Amen. Amen. If you don't know the
[1:52:34] first,
[1:52:35] you will say the next is the first.
[1:52:45] &gt;&gt; He says it is the next announcement.
[1:52:51] &gt;&gt; But let me just read it here.
[1:52:54] &gt;&gt; Um,
[1:52:57] let me perhaps be faster.
[1:53:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:02] Is it easy?
[1:53:04] H is this the sign of the answer?
[1:53:10] Paragraph 26.
[1:53:12] &gt;&gt; Paragraph 2.
[1:53:13] &gt;&gt; This angel come down from heaven.
[1:53:17] He's talking about chapter 10.
[1:53:21] He said the other seven angels of seven
[1:53:25] are of the seven church ages
[1:53:30] messengers.
[1:53:34] But this angel
[1:53:36] all the message is finished.
[1:53:43] I said to you one day
[1:53:48] has preach everything.
[1:53:57] everything.
[1:53:59] &gt;&gt; The message is finished.
[1:54:06] [applause]
[1:54:07] The seventh angel,
[1:54:10] the seventh angel
[1:54:12] wings up the whole thing.
[1:54:17] And this angel comes not to the earth.
[1:54:23] He is he isn't a man from the earth
[1:54:27] &gt;&gt; as the messengers to the church
[1:54:32] that is finished.
[1:54:34] But this angel brings the next
[1:54:37] announcement.
[1:54:42] And an angel is a messenger.
[1:54:45] He comes down from heaven
[1:54:48] clothed in that pillar of life
[1:54:53] with a rainbow over his head.
[1:54:57] The rainbow was a covenant.
[1:55:00] It was Christ.
[1:55:03] Hallelujah.
[1:55:07] &gt;&gt; What was
[1:55:08] this announcement for?
[1:55:14] This announcement is a call
[1:55:18] to come to eat
[1:55:22] to eat.
[1:55:26] This announcement
[1:55:28] is a call
[1:55:30] to the bride,
[1:55:32] to the eagles
[1:55:34] to come and gather
[1:55:38] and eat
[1:55:40] to the store fruit,
[1:55:46] the hidden mana,
[1:55:50] cigarette food.
[1:55:55] This next announcement,
[1:55:58] &gt;&gt; it is a calling
[1:56:00] &gt;&gt; is calling us
[1:56:02] because if you are pregnant,
[1:56:06] you need special diets,
[1:56:11] you don't just eat. You know, you women,
[1:56:19] you don't, if you want your baby to grow
[1:56:23] healthier,
[1:56:27] You must select the food.
[1:56:32] We are pregnant.
[1:56:36] &gt;&gt; I am happy to tell you
[1:56:40] I am pregnant.
[1:56:45] That is the reason I don't just eat.
[1:56:48] Hallelujah.
[1:56:52] When you try to feed me,
[1:56:55] I look at you
[1:57:00] because I know
[1:57:03] the food that must fit
[1:57:08] that baby
[1:57:10] so that he can grow.
[1:57:13] When he has grown enough,
[1:57:15] he will be born.
[1:57:18] Amen.
[1:57:25] Let me read this. The prophet what is
[1:57:28] the prophet says here it may be the end
[1:57:31] time.
[1:57:33] It may be the time the time the rainbow
[1:57:35] the rainbows will sweep across the sky.
[1:57:43] an announcement from heaven
[1:57:47] saying time is no more.
[1:57:50] If it is,
[1:57:53] let us prepare ourselves
[1:57:57] friends to meet our God.
[1:58:01] There has been plenty of food laid in
[1:58:06] now.
[1:58:14] We must prepare ourselves
[1:58:16] &gt;&gt; so that we must have this food
[1:58:22] plenty of food.
[1:58:25] We are not playing here.
[1:58:36] Let's make use of it.
[1:58:43] &gt;&gt; Let Amen.
[1:58:45] &gt;&gt; Let's make use of it now.
[1:58:52] Amen.
[1:58:53] &gt;&gt; This food
[1:58:57] hidden manner.
[1:59:00] &gt;&gt; This what the prophet says here.
[1:59:04] when he was praying here.
[1:59:08] &gt;&gt; Let me if the book I can have it here
[1:59:14] because
[1:59:15] what is the hidden fruit?
[1:59:20] &gt;&gt; The revelation of the son of man.
[1:59:24] Amen. the the Mechisedc Melkisedc
[1:59:28] &gt;&gt; because
[1:59:31] the prophetic sign
[1:59:34] &gt;&gt; is the son of Melkisedc.
[1:59:36] &gt;&gt; Sorry.
[1:59:37] &gt;&gt; Is the sign of Melisedc?
[1:59:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:42] &gt;&gt; Guess why our prophet preached?
[1:59:47] Who?
[1:59:49] Who is this?
[1:59:54] Where was that?
[1:59:57] He was in that man.
[2:00:02] They revealed himself.
[2:00:07] Amen.
[2:00:09] &gt;&gt; Through the prophet.
[2:00:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:16] Yes, sir.
[2:00:17] &gt;&gt; I believe you believe it.
[2:00:21] that he revealed himself
[2:00:25] through the prophet.
[2:00:32] He says here he was pray.
[2:00:37] We see the handwriting on the wall.
[2:00:41] We are at the end time.
[2:00:43] We know that there is great thing laying
[2:00:46] ahead.
[2:00:50] But yet somewhere
[2:00:52] out in this mess
[2:00:58] is still there. There are still honest
[2:01:00] people
[2:01:05] that is being ordained to life.
[2:01:09] It would be impossible for one man
[2:01:14] or two but God all of us together
[2:01:21] Let us every let us go let us spread to
[2:01:25] every corner
[2:01:29] the good news that Jesus is coming.
[2:01:34] Just spread the little bread
[2:01:39] along along
[2:01:41] a little weight
[2:01:44] wherever the eagles are.
[2:01:49] Amen.
[2:01:50] &gt;&gt; They will follow that foot.
[2:01:57] &gt;&gt; He says
[2:02:00] the mana
[2:02:03] &gt;&gt; is the cass.
[2:02:06] &gt;&gt; Where the cass is
[2:02:08] the angels will gather
[2:02:12] and the cass is the word of God for your
[2:02:15] season.
[2:02:20] We have got the word of God for this
[2:02:22] season.
[2:02:25] That is the cass.
[2:02:28] &gt;&gt; What is the cass?
[2:02:31] &gt;&gt; The weight of God
[2:02:34] Christ.
[2:02:36] &gt;&gt; He said,
[2:02:37] &gt;&gt; I don't want to read the quotes. Amen.
[2:02:39] &gt;&gt; The
[2:02:41] is Christ,
[2:02:42] &gt;&gt; the son of man.
[2:02:44] the boot of the son of man.
[2:02:51] This is the time to eat
[2:02:55] the kakas
[2:02:58] which is the good weight.
[2:03:02] Let me read this one first.
[2:03:10] It says here
[2:03:12] I want to start it in the middle there.
[2:03:17] &gt;&gt; I want to study in the middle page 59
[2:03:21] paragraph 269 anointed ones. But I I
[2:03:26] read it in the middle there.
[2:03:29] He said I was only a voice that he used
[2:03:33] to say it.
[2:03:37] It wasn't that I knew.
[2:03:41] It was what I just surrender myself to.
[2:03:47] He spoke through
[2:03:50] me.
[2:03:52] It was the seventh angel. It wasn't the
[2:03:55] seventh angel.
[2:03:57] Oh no. It was the manifestation of the
[2:04:00] son of man.
[2:04:03] It wasn't the angel.
[2:04:06] His message.
[2:04:08] It was the mystery that got unfolded.
[2:04:14] Is not a man.
[2:04:17] Is God. The angel was not the son of
[2:04:20] man.
[2:04:23] He was the messenger from the son of
[2:04:25] man.
[2:04:30] Who the angel is talking about?
[2:04:33] William Brennham.
[2:04:36] He was not the son of man. He was he was
[2:04:39] the messenger from the son of God. The
[2:04:42] messenger from the son of man.
[2:04:45] The son of man revealed himself
[2:04:49] through this man.
[2:04:51] Amen.
[2:04:54] The son of man is Christ.
[2:04:58] He is the one that you are feeding on.
[2:05:04] You are not feeding on a man.
[2:05:09] A man and his ways will fail.
[2:05:14] But you are feeding on the unfailing,
[2:05:20] the body weight
[2:05:23] of the son of man.
[2:05:26] The cacas.
[2:05:28] The cass
[2:05:30] is the body weight
[2:05:33] of the son of man is the hidden man.
[2:05:38] To access the man,
[2:05:40] there must be a man.
[2:05:43] That's why God said, "I will give you
[2:05:46] pastors
[2:05:48] who will feed you with knowledge and
[2:05:52] understanding because God brings the
[2:05:56] message directly to him.
[2:06:00] He has that access
[2:06:03] so that he must get where
[2:06:06] in that holy of holies
[2:06:09] where the mana is placed
[2:06:12] so that he can go there.
[2:06:14] Pick that man and so that he can feed
[2:06:17] you
[2:06:19] [cheering]
[2:06:20] [applause]
[2:06:26] is a special diet.
[2:06:29] The hidden mana is a special diet
[2:06:35] for the pregnant people.
[2:06:38] The special diet
[2:06:42] is for the big fish.
[2:06:44] If you want to catch the big fish,
[2:06:47] you must use a special diet.
[2:06:53] If you want to catch a big fish,
[2:06:56] you must have a special diet.
[2:07:00] to catch the bride
[2:07:02] to to attract the bride. You must use
[2:07:05] the special food.
[2:07:10] That is the third pool.
[2:07:14] This is the dispensation of the first
[2:07:17] the third pool
[2:07:20] because the big fish
[2:07:23] is caught by the third.
[2:07:30] You cannot catch the big fish second
[2:07:34] pool, third pool second.
[2:07:39] But you must use the third
[2:07:44] then you catch the big fish.
[2:07:46] This is the age
[2:07:49] of the big feet
[2:07:52] which is the royal seed of Abraham.
[2:08:04] What a lesson. What a lesson.
[2:08:09] &gt;&gt; What a lesson.
[2:08:12] Amen.

[2:08:16] where we are where we are standing,
[2:08:21] look where we are at now.
