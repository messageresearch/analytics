[1:15:11] opportunity come
[1:15:13] forth may the Lord richly bless
[1:15:16] you amen amen I have two announcement
[1:15:21] that I want to give to the church
[1:15:26] the first one is regarding the
[1:15:33] donations normally Believers donate the
[1:15:36] clothes for
[1:15:41] the our request is that if you have
[1:15:44] clothes to
[1:15:49] donate put a
[1:15:51] note note inside the B
[1:15:56] and hand it to the
[1:15:59] elders hallelujah hallelujah we normally
[1:16:03] advise that to give them to brother
[1:16:08] mad then he knows where to P them
[1:16:13] accordingly so that when our elders
[1:16:16] going to
[1:16:18] L then he can carry
[1:16:21] them if you don't put a note
[1:16:25] sometimes we just assume you brought
[1:16:29] them for us to B
[1:16:33] them because we also
[1:16:35] receive ER clothes and other
[1:16:39] things that are for
[1:16:45] underworld so people hand
[1:16:48] things so that they can be
[1:16:51] banned so if you don't put a note
[1:16:56] we always
[1:16:58] assume that it is not a donation for the
[1:17:04] clothes hallelujah hallelujah may the
[1:17:07] Lord richly bless
[1:17:09] you we also have a
[1:17:12] request we have the young people in the
[1:17:18] church sometimes when they use the
[1:17:21] restrooms
[1:17:25] they misuse the toilet
[1:17:30] papers sometimes they accidentally throw
[1:17:34] the toilet papers inside the
[1:17:39] water so we are
[1:17:42] appealing that the
[1:17:45] parents guide them
[1:17:49] accordingly so that when they use the
[1:17:51] restrooms they can take caution
[1:17:57] if he is too
[1:17:59] young we request the parents to
[1:18:02] accompany them to the
[1:18:05] restrooms may the Lord richly bless
[1:18:08] you as we stand on our
[1:18:11] feet we are blessed this

[1:22:35] amen happy New Year
[1:22:39] amen I believe God will bless you this
[1:22:43] year as I normally
[1:22:46] say the New Year
[1:22:49] means approaching the
[1:22:52] Rapture because it's not like like
[1:22:55] yesterday it's a new morning it's a new
[1:23:00] day it's a new
[1:23:02] year amen amen so I want to tell you
[1:23:07] that uh our pastor was supposed to be
[1:23:10] here this
[1:23:12] morning but while he was preparing to
[1:23:15] come something just came
[1:23:18] up and then he said I must just greet
[1:23:22] the church
[1:23:24] read the
[1:23:25] scripture for a few
[1:23:28] minutes and then we go
[1:23:30] home amen amen so that's why I'm
[1:23:34] standing here this
[1:23:36] morning I'm not going to take much of
[1:23:40] your
[1:23:41] time amen amen I think last
[1:23:46] year I promised you to say something
[1:23:51] about I just want to give you just just
[1:23:55] that
[1:23:56] testimony I
[1:23:58] remember I went several times
[1:24:09] to so
[1:24:11] I said yes because he
[1:24:14] was so um I I observe
[1:24:19] something then I
[1:24:22] ask that there something something you
[1:24:25] know that I observe
[1:24:28] here amen amen that is not
[1:24:33] right it's a
[1:24:35] demon then I thought we should fight it
[1:24:40] amen is is a another
[1:24:44] country where things are done
[1:24:47] differently
[1:24:50] toward something that I observed
[1:24:54] was a first
[1:25:02] marriages marriages
[1:25:05] whereby a young man
[1:25:10] forcefully will take a
[1:25:12] girl and put it his
[1:25:15] home and then tell send somebody to tell
[1:25:18] the
[1:25:20] parents your daughter is
[1:25:23] here whether that girl you know agree or
[1:25:28] not she will just
[1:25:31] go king and the country
[1:25:35] in amen amen so once a marriage becomes
[1:25:40] a FSE
[1:25:43] marriage you will never love that
[1:25:46] woman you won't even
[1:25:49] value because you mared her forcefully
[1:25:55] that is why most of those
[1:25:59] men those
[1:26:01] men when they come to South Africa
[1:26:03] working the
[1:26:06] M they started another families
[1:26:09] here when they go back home they go
[1:26:13] Angry beat their
[1:26:16] wives beat the children because it's a
[1:26:19] false
[1:26:21] marriage amen amen so
[1:26:24] now we prayed about the
[1:26:28] thing last year December I mean I mean
[1:26:31] September we coming
[1:26:33] from and then I started that topic in
[1:26:36] the
[1:26:38] car then
[1:26:41] said oh you were not
[1:26:43] aware that the government has announced
[1:26:47] the whole
[1:26:48] country that best thing should stop
[1:26:53] [Applause]
[1:26:55] I thank
[1:26:56] God I say God you've answered
[1:27:00] us because
[1:27:03] marriage should not be
[1:27:05] Force two should
[1:27:08] agree and then even the government went
[1:27:11] further and said the the
[1:27:14] parents as well has the right to
[1:27:20] disagree in that marriage so the the
[1:27:23] marriage now
[1:27:26] between the
[1:27:27] two parents in
[1:27:31] agreement I thank God for
[1:27:34] that this word of God can change the law
[1:27:39] of the
[1:27:41] country the other thing I observed when
[1:27:44] we get
[1:27:47] there is my
[1:27:49] witness I normally when I get there I
[1:27:52] will see things and
[1:27:55] question we baptized young
[1:27:59] sisters then when they come to
[1:28:03] church they they come to
[1:28:06] church they come with bold head B
[1:28:11] head only to find that in the school and
[1:28:15] in the government they say young
[1:28:18] sisters should cut their
[1:28:21] hair because their hairs
[1:28:25] has got
[1:28:26] demons so that's what I observed when I
[1:28:29] get
[1:28:30] there thank God
[1:28:32] today that thing has came
[1:28:35] to so those things we
[1:28:39] receive and
[1:28:41] then gender based violence in a life
[1:28:47] [Music]
[1:28:50] normal pray about that because most of
[1:28:53] the time
[1:28:55] when you speak to the sisters when they
[1:28:59] consult a higher
[1:29:02] percentage pray for me my husband is
[1:29:06] beating me for no
[1:29:09] reason let's pray on that
[1:29:11] one I'll wait for the
[1:29:15] testimony amen amen so
[1:29:18] yesterday we were
[1:29:20] in we left Friday and come back
[1:29:23] yesterday
[1:29:26] just to be like Joshua and
[1:29:29] Caleb when they went to spy
[1:29:32] Jer we went to a certain
[1:29:35] place to check if when we come back for
[1:29:39] a
[1:29:41] message the seat will be planted
[1:29:44] and I I I don't know the north southeast
[1:29:50] of he went to another place
[1:29:56] and the way
[1:29:59] to that's where we want to take the
[1:30:01] message
[1:30:02] to with your prayers the country will
[1:30:05] know this
[1:30:07] message as the absolute of
[1:30:10] their so let's pray about the whole
[1:30:13] thing the pastor knows we spoke to him
[1:30:17] he said for what we
[1:30:19] call amen so we really appreciate it
[1:30:23] amen
[1:30:24] yes that's what I wanted to tell you
[1:30:26] this
[1:30:27] morning keep on playing for the suit for
[1:30:30] Su keep on praying for
[1:30:34] them things that we see there maybe you
[1:30:38] don't see

[1:45:02] and the strangers that were conversent
[1:45:06] among them amen amen you may be
[1:45:11] seated we are going to talk about Joshua
[1:45:16] today amen amen so my message
[1:45:21] is Joshua Joshua a man with a
[1:45:26] reputation amen
[1:45:29] amen I was reading from the spoken
[1:45:33] we brother was
[1:45:36] saying only what we
[1:45:40] need only what we
[1:45:43] need is a man of
[1:45:46] reputation you can go wherever you
[1:45:49] are if you do not have reputation
[1:45:53] we don't need you we need
[1:46:01] men well for you to have
[1:46:05] reputation you must have passed certain
[1:46:10] stages two stages the third one is the
[1:46:16] reputation now listen to what the
[1:46:19] scripture says
[1:46:21] here there was not a word of
[1:46:25] H that Moses
[1:46:29] commanded which
[1:46:32] Joshua
[1:46:34] not all the congregation of
[1:46:37] Israel with the
[1:46:38] women and the little ones and the
[1:46:43] strangers that were conversent
[1:46:47] among amen amen Joshua Joshua was a good
[1:46:51] follower
[1:46:53] what I want to tell you
[1:46:55] this for you to be a reputable
[1:47:00] man you must have had
[1:47:06] courage before you have
[1:47:09] courage you must have had an
[1:47:15] inspiration you get
[1:47:17] inspired after the
[1:47:20] inspiration you have courage
[1:47:23] after
[1:47:24] courage become a
[1:47:28] reputable amen amen is God only who
[1:47:33] gives you
[1:47:36] courage but
[1:47:39] inspiration you get it
[1:47:42] from a man not
[1:47:47] God a man must inspire you
[1:47:53] for you to have
[1:47:56] courage then you become a man
[1:48:01] of that's what I'm going to talk
[1:48:04] about because
[1:48:07] joshuaa the Bible says all the
[1:48:11] Commandment that Moses gave to
[1:48:14] him he read to the
[1:48:18] congregation he got
[1:48:21] inspired by the life of
[1:48:24] Moses how Moses did
[1:48:27] things and Moses was an ordinary person
[1:48:31] like you and
[1:48:33] me but God visited
[1:48:36] him amen amen and Moses had a
[1:48:41] challenge with his
[1:48:44] wife but he never divorced her he was
[1:48:48] never angry he contined with the word of
[1:48:51] God
[1:48:52] that kind of a
[1:48:54] woman when mes says one she's already at
[1:49:01] 10 because he can call him new bloody
[1:49:06] husband today you can't call your
[1:49:16] husband they are there may God bless
[1:49:19] that because Moses has to pass through
[1:49:22] that as
[1:49:24] well challing
[1:49:27] woman even circumcise her own
[1:49:33] son you understand we have those in life
[1:49:39] don't life and God does
[1:49:46] everything he knew
[1:49:49] why so he started to read
[1:49:53] what Moses taught him and he continue
[1:49:56] with it for the rest of his
[1:49:59] life until one of the
[1:50:02] days God visited
[1:50:05] Joshua before he visited
[1:50:07] Joshua he got
[1:50:10] inspired from
[1:50:12] Moses he was a good follower no
[1:50:18] matter what Moses say he will do it
[1:50:24] because he
[1:50:26] realized God whom he
[1:50:28] worshiped was
[1:50:32] Ines he was not following Moses as a
[1:50:36] person he was following what was
[1:50:41] in that's why he became a man of
[1:50:46] rep you know they are men but you should
[1:50:50] be a man
[1:50:53] amongst me a man whom other will look
[1:50:57] up we need such and compromised
[1:51:06] me let's read Joshua chapter one my my
[1:51:10] scriptures today is three of
[1:51:12] them the one for
[1:51:15] inspiration from Joshua the one from for
[1:51:18] courage from Joshua the one from
[1:51:21] reputation
[1:51:23] from Joshua let's go to the second one
[1:51:26] of
[1:51:27] courage and when I talk about Joshua I
[1:51:30] speak about you you must be like
[1:51:35] him verse 5 to 7 1 ver 5 to 7 CH 5 1 ver
[1:51:42] 5-7 there shall not any man be able to
[1:51:45] stand before thee all the days of thy
[1:51:47] life as I was with Moses so I will be
[1:51:51] with thee I will not fail thee nor
[1:51:53] forsake thee be strong and of good
[1:51:56] courage For unto these people shall thou
[1:51:59] divide for an inheritance the land which
[1:52:02] i s unto their father to give them only
[1:52:07] be thou strong and very courageous that
[1:52:10] thou might observe to do according to
[1:52:13] all that law all the law which Moses my
[1:52:17] servant commanded thee turn not from it
[1:52:20] to the right hand or to the left left
[1:52:23] that thou might Prosper
[1:52:26] with with soever thou goest amen amen
[1:52:30] this is a message of
[1:52:34] encouragement be strong and of a good
[1:52:39] courage I will never fail
[1:52:43] thee nor forsake thee this was God
[1:52:47] talking to
[1:52:49] Joshua you need courage from God
[1:52:52] but you need
[1:52:54] inspiration from a man he had
[1:52:58] inspiration from A Man Called
[1:53:02] Moses now he need
[1:53:04] courage from God himself after God gave
[1:53:08] him courage he became a reputable man
[1:53:12] you need to know where you need a man
[1:53:16] where you need God where you need to
[1:53:19] stand alone
[1:53:22] don't just leave
[1:53:24] H you must live with a
[1:53:27] purpose you must know your
[1:53:30] standpoint you must know your position
[1:53:32] in God until no one can shake
[1:53:40] you if someone can shake you you were
[1:53:44] standing on a
[1:53:50] shake you must come to a point
[1:53:53] whereby even if other people can talk
[1:53:57] bad about your pastor but you will say
[1:54:02] I'll still stick to him because God whom
[1:54:05] I worship I see in him many people came
[1:54:10] to Joshua discouraging him but God gave
[1:54:14] him courage until he stick to
[1:54:18] Moses after sticking to Moses what was
[1:54:21] in Moses
[1:54:23] is now in him and when he's in him they
[1:54:27] were looking at him when he was flying
[1:54:29] up there be that kind of a man the
[1:54:33] people will come and go will come and
[1:54:37] discourage you and so forth and so forth
[1:54:41] sck what you believe
[1:54:46] in then Joshua absorbed from
[1:54:50] God then he leave
[1:54:53] knowing that I got encouragement from
[1:54:57] God you see God said to him I will not
[1:55:03] forsake thee that was God it was not
[1:55:07] Moses that was God and then Joshua lived
[1:55:11] a good life before God before Israel and
[1:55:16] then they started to test him they
[1:55:20] started to test him
[1:55:23] these people when they test Joshua he
[1:55:26] stood for his
[1:55:28] cause I'm going to read you a code here
[1:55:31] brother Bram says if you are a child of
[1:55:34] God you are not getting tested you are
[1:55:38] not getting
[1:55:41] tempted you did not yet come to a place
[1:55:44] where God can trust
[1:55:49] you you need to be tested
[1:55:52] Temptation need to come your way and you
[1:55:55] must be happy for the
[1:55:57] Temptation for they make you
[1:56:00] stronger they make you
[1:56:03] stronger amen
[1:56:05] amen you no longer cry you no longer
[1:56:09] complain about the
[1:56:11] wishes you just
[1:56:13] smile because you know I have courage I
[1:56:17] am strong because he confirm it to me
[1:56:21] now I be a man of
[1:56:26] reputation when they test Joshua he
[1:56:29] didn't run away he didn't pray he didn't
[1:56:32] complain but he said something you
[1:56:35] better say that as well let's read it in
[1:56:39] the Book of Joshua chapter
[1:56:41] 24 he was inspired he got courage then
[1:56:46] he become a man of
[1:56:47] reputation verse 14 to
[1:56:50] 17s 24 vers 14 that's my last scripture
[1:56:54] to
[1:56:56] 22 Joshua 24 ver14 to 17 yes amen now
[1:57:03] therefore fear the lord and serve him in
[1:57:07] sincerity and in truth and put away the
[1:57:10] gods which your father SED on the other
[1:57:13] side of the flood and in Egypt and serve
[1:57:17] ye the Lord and if it seem evil unto you
[1:57:20] to serve the Lord choose you this day
[1:57:23] whom you will serve whether the gods
[1:57:26] which your father served that were on
[1:57:28] the other side of the flat or the gods
[1:57:31] of the amorites in whose land he dwell
[1:57:34] but as for me and my house we will serve
[1:57:37] the Lord let's just stop there you know
[1:57:40] a man of
[1:57:41] reputation he come to a place whereby he

[1:57:52] to tell me what I need to do but I will
[1:57:56] serve the

[1:58:03] reputation he knows his
[1:58:06] stand the people cannot shake
[1:58:10] you
[1:58:13] continue 16 and the people answered and
[1:58:16] said God forbid that we should forsake
[1:58:19] the Lord to serve other gods for the
[1:58:22] Lord Our God he it is that brought us up
[1:58:25] and our fathers out of the land of Egypt
[1:58:29] from the house of bondage and which did
[1:58:32] those great signs in our sight and
[1:58:35] preserved Us in all the way wherein we
[1:58:38] went and among all the people through
[1:58:41] whom we passed amen amen you know Joshua
[1:58:45] Joshua after getting
[1:58:47] inspired and encouraged by God he have
[1:58:51] to stand for this because
[1:58:54] inspiration and
[1:58:56] encouragement
[1:58:58] produce
[1:59:00] reputation when they brought reputation

[2:02:26] my family Shall Serve the Lord the
[2:02:30] others can go wherever they want but I
[2:02:32] will stick to
[2:02:37] this be like Joshua a man of reputation
[2:02:42] a man who looked at the
[2:02:47] Unseen from the
[2:02:49] Masterpiece the pastor quote last
[2:02:53] week I I got it here as well because it
[2:02:56] speaks about Michel
[2:02:59] Angelo said Michel Angelo when he do the
[2:03:03] Masterpiece of Moses he was
[2:03:07] seeing something that other people
[2:03:11] couldn't
[2:03:14] see amen
[2:03:17] amen he was
[2:03:20] tasked to make the stat of
[2:03:24] Moses amen am Michel Angelo Mich Angel a
[2:03:28] sculptor from
[2:03:31] Italy amen I read but this and the
[2:03:35] Master's piece that Michael Angelo had
[2:03:40] made it cost him something to do
[2:03:44] that he was a great man it costed a big
[2:03:48] part of his life
[2:03:52] because he was many many years in caving
[2:03:56] out just take a rock of
[2:03:59] marble and keep it caving it the people
[2:04:03] were laughing at him he was doing it in
[2:04:07] his heart in his vision he saw Moses so
[2:04:12] he tried to bring
[2:04:15] him on this rock then he continued doing
[2:04:19] it and do it the people were looking at
[2:04:22] him passing you know he was continuing
[2:04:27] every day when he he wake UPS he
[2:04:30] continue with that work because he saw
[2:04:34] Moses now a geni
[2:04:39] sculptor is
[2:04:41] inspired you see you need to start with
[2:04:46] inspiration like a genuine
[2:04:49] poet or any other genuine
[2:04:53] singer or a
[2:04:56] musician whatever it might be all realiz
[2:05:00] to come by
[2:05:02] inspiration Michel Angelo must have had
[2:05:05] an inspiration of whates really
[2:05:10] like amen and he CAU it in his
[2:05:14] mind what Moses must have
[2:05:18] been so he he set forth on his great
[2:05:21] piece of mind
[2:05:22] [Music]
[2:05:23] they cut into the
[2:05:25] patter bring it down Hing down until he
[2:05:30] got the real picture of what must
[2:05:36] have amen amen a sculptor would make a
[2:05:39] great
[2:05:41] Masterpiece and then take it and set it
[2:05:44] in an alley
[2:05:47] somewhere or hide it behind the
[2:05:50] building as as our lord Jesus told us a
[2:05:56] man doesn't light a hand a candle and
[2:06:00] put it under a
[2:06:02] bution when he becomes God
[2:06:05] Masterpiece will not it in an early
[2:06:09] somewhere we must give it
[2:06:14] light let the people know who you
[2:06:18] are at your University
[2:06:22] at your
[2:06:23] workplace at your
[2:06:26] home at your
[2:06:28] neighbors in your
[2:06:31] relative light up that
[2:06:35] candle other people they don't know
[2:06:38] whether they are Christian or at their
[2:06:39] work
[2:06:41] places if they don't know who you are at
[2:06:43] your
[2:06:44] work you have a
[2:06:46] problem I'm telling you the
[2:06:49] truth why the colleag don't know that
[2:06:52] you are a
[2:06:53] Christian what are you
[2:06:58] hiding so we see it after he had made
[2:07:01] his master
[2:07:03] piece he he placs it up here on
[2:07:06] Earth and put it in the most beautiful
[2:07:09] place there
[2:07:11] was is God now in the Garden of
[2:07:15] Eden how he has must have pleased
[2:07:19] him that he saw his Master this
[2:07:22] masterpiece was well after that we found
[2:07:26] out that he
[2:07:28] rested he was so
[2:07:30] pleased with his work when God
[2:07:35] condescend he
[2:07:37] condescended as God and incarnate
[2:07:41] himself in his
[2:07:44] Masterpiece when that Masterpiece stand
[2:07:47] up it was God that masterpiece
[2:07:52] was a man and a man becomes
[2:07:59] God the Masterpiece came to to me and to
[2:08:04] you is because God smoked
[2:08:08] it at
[2:08:10] Calvary no matter how many dead he had
[2:08:15] raised how great he had
[2:08:17] preached what his great life was
[2:08:21] what his claim was he was proven there
[2:08:26] he was so
[2:08:27] pleased God was till he was the only man
[2:08:32] that ever stood on the face of the
[2:08:35] Earth that God could Smite for the rest
[2:08:38] of
[2:08:40] them that perfect one was meeting for
[2:08:44] the
[2:08:46] imperfect the whole
[2:08:49] creation that had fell
[2:08:52] through
[2:08:53] Adam it was
[2:08:55] redeemed through Jesus
[2:08:57] Christ God Master
[2:09:01] peace stood the
[2:09:05] test the test
[2:09:07] come because of
[2:09:09] Temptation you need to be
[2:09:13] tempted
[2:09:15] tested and become a man of
[2:09:20] reputation Jesus becames a man of
[2:09:23] reputation for the entire
[2:09:26] world even the Sinners speak about him
[2:09:30] because there's no other way you can
[2:09:33] have your entire life without talking
[2:09:36] about Jesus because he was a man of
[2:09:40] reputation he stood the test of
[2:09:43] time he became more than a
[2:09:46] conqueror until today when we are called
[2:09:50] Christian
[2:09:51] we must have been in his
[2:09:56] footsteps we must be more than
[2:09:59] conquer we must have been
[2:10:02] tested so we were in the footstep of our
[2:10:05] Lord Jesus Christ when we were in the
[2:10:08] footstep of the of Christ Jesus at the
[2:10:12] end we
[2:10:14] became
[2:10:17] him until the people say you are making
[2:10:21] yourself God you are making yourself
[2:10:25] better you think you know better
[2:10:28] than till the people say seven SE or no

[2:34:00] said the architect all stand around and
[2:34:04] say as soon as any

[2:34:29] insurance he said my bridge will hold he
[2:34:34] had
[2:34:35] confidence remember he just have
[2:34:39] confidence because he met something that
[2:34:42] others could not
[2:34:44] mean now he must test it because it's
[2:34:47] his his reputation at state
[2:34:53] certainly it is and if it did hold it
[2:34:58] will be
[2:35:02] Memorial amen amen the reputation of
[2:35:05] Christ is
[2:35:07] at he will not give us just something to
[2:35:09] build a
[2:35:12] church not a manmade
[2:35:16] theology not upon some school experience
[2:35:22] or build some
[2:35:24] Seminary as they wanted to this
[2:35:27] morning to educate
[2:35:29] preachers the real
[2:35:31] preacher come from the Seminary of God's

[2:35:46] confidence in
[2:35:48] you we got confidence in
[2:35:53] him amen amen
[2:35:56] now the man reputation was at
[2:36:02] stake then the breach was
[2:36:05] completed at the required
[2:36:08] time that bre did not even have a
[2:36:11] duration you know in the
[2:36:14] project when they give you a project of
[2:36:16] three
[2:36:17] years finish it on the fourth of the
[2:36:19] fifth
[2:36:21] year you not going to get a
[2:36:23] profit youve done it at
[2:36:27] loss we we we agreed on that but this
[2:36:31] one was so special until they even say
[2:36:36] take your time but at the end you want
[2:36:40] the good
[2:36:41] products then he said guys we are done
[2:36:46] and then he said I will
[2:36:50] walk on this
[2:36:52] pre hey this man had confidence if you
[2:36:56] don't want to I'll go
[2:36:59] alone I will go alone on this bridge of
[2:37:04] South and North
[2:37:06] C come back and I will go alone and come
[2:37:11] back this was the the
[2:37:14] idea that Joshua had if you don't want
[2:37:17] to worship
[2:37:19] I will go
[2:37:21] alone with my family I will go alone and
[2:37:26] stand there if you don't come none of my
[2:37:30] business this man said to them I will
[2:37:33] walk alone if you don't come it's none
[2:37:36] of your business and then something came
[2:37:39] into the mayor and the mayor said to him
[2:37:43] no I'll go with you I'll follow you with
[2:37:46] my mayor's
[2:37:47] car then this man said because I have
[2:37:51] confidence you can even bring four
[2:37:57] locomotives the
[2:37:59] tracks
[2:38:01] everything they can walk in the
[2:38:06] bridge I like it when
[2:38:10] Jesus was going to Jerusalem with an
[2:38:14] S when he get
[2:38:16] somewhere he stopped and look at
[2:38:20] Jerusalem and started to prophesy he was
[2:38:24] alone when he started to prophesy and
[2:38:27] Tred to take one step the young people
[2:38:31] just brought
[2:38:32] leaves and put it before you so that the
[2:38:36] lot of hosts can walk you know you know
[2:38:41] it was an automatic thing things of God
[2:38:45] happen automatically you don't need to
[2:38:48] plan them
[2:38:50] doing them I see this man as well John
[2:38:54] brefeld when he say I will walk the
[2:38:57] mayor said I will follow with some
[2:39:01] tracks with some
[2:39:03] locomotive the people with the Camas
[2:39:07] were looking waiting for the briest to
[2:39:10] fall other people that were never
[2:39:13] invited
[2:39:15] automatically heart something just say
[2:39:26] man and they followed him they just walk
[2:39:30] on the bridge maybe let me read it
[2:39:33] because he's here on the spoken
[2:39:34] way that young fellow walked out there
[2:39:38] on that bridge set his car
