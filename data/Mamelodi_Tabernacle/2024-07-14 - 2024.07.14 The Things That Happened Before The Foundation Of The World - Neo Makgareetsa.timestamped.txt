[1:10:27] this morning before you oh God that you
[1:10:30] just use him heavenly father as we have
[1:10:32] heard even throughout the days that when
[1:10:35] the truly anointed servants are speaking

[1:10:53] the service into your hands in Jesus
[1:10:54] name
[1:10:56] amen amen please
[1:10:59] read Matthew 13 verse 35
[1:11:06] amen that it might be fulfilled which
[1:11:09] was spoken by the prophet saying I will
[1:11:13] open my mouth in Parables I will utter
[1:11:16] things which have been kept secret from
[1:11:19] the foundation of the world amen amen
[1:11:22] you may be
[1:11:23] seated uh we
[1:11:27] don't okay others have read from their
[1:11:33] Bibles so we
[1:11:36] will continue with the word of God this
[1:11:40] morning and we thank God for
[1:11:44] everything amen amen so the message for
[1:11:48] this
[1:11:49] morning we will talk about the things
[1:11:52] just just what happened before the
[1:11:54] foundation the
[1:11:58] world subtitle will be fighting from
[1:12:07] Victory amen amen the word of God on it
[1:12:13] own it's
[1:12:15] [Applause]
[1:12:16] Unique there are things that
[1:12:20] happened there are things that are
[1:12:22] happening and there are things that
[1:12:24] Willen
[1:12:26] happen as long as we are still in this
[1:12:29] body but God undertake
[1:12:34] all amen amen so we we read
[1:12:39] here looking at what Jesus was doing in
[1:12:42] his
[1:12:44] time well I'm going to read chap verse
[1:12:47] two of the same
[1:12:50] chapter it says and great multitude were
[1:12:54] gathering together unto him so that he
[1:12:56] went into the sheep and said and the
[1:12:58] whole multitude stood on the shore and
[1:13:01] he spake many things unto them in
[1:13:03] Parable saying behold asour went forth
[1:13:07] to sow amen amen so when you look at
[1:13:12] this Jesus was preaching to the
[1:13:17] multitude and
[1:13:19] deliberately with
[1:13:23] Parables and then as as time goes
[1:13:26] by you read verse
[1:13:29] 24 it says another
[1:13:40] Parable amen amen and then about the
[1:13:43] Kingdom of
[1:13:44] Heaven it was another
[1:13:47] Parable when you read verse
[1:13:50] 31 it say another parable
[1:13:55] you read verse
[1:13:57] 33 another Parable so he was preaching
[1:14:01] about The
[1:14:03] Parables and The Parables and The
[1:14:06] Parables because there were too
[1:14:09] many it says
[1:14:12] multitude you know when you have many
[1:14:14] people you have many
[1:14:17] problems because they don't think the
[1:14:19] same and they will never understand the
[1:14:23] same am amen amen you know this morning
[1:14:28] I may stand
[1:14:30] here after the service talk different
[1:14:35] [Applause]
[1:14:37] things that is why there will be always
[1:14:43] contradic because the word is one but we
[1:14:46] don't understand it the
[1:14:49] same so Jesus was trying to eliminate
[1:14:52] the
[1:14:54] number get to the
[1:14:56] number that when he
[1:14:59] speak
[1:15:03] understand as I was saying the other
[1:15:05] day one Minister was preaching about
[1:15:09] Seven
[1:15:10] Seals and then after the service the
[1:15:13] church was so happy and then forgetting
[1:15:18] Revelation then forgetting the
[1:15:22] Revelation no no whoit
[1:15:31] after
[1:15:33] after people
[1:15:36] were saying they have received the
[1:15:38] Revelation amen all right so the
[1:15:41] Revelation
[1:15:42] was oh when you were preaching we have
[1:15:45] seen the power of God revealing unto
[1:15:51] us are not s
[1:15:55] there
[1:15:56] 4 the minister was so
[1:16:00] disappointed because it's not what
[1:16:05] he when they
[1:16:08] open when the SE
[1:16:10] open dou
[1:16:13] itself then they started to
[1:16:17] see he was in the
[1:16:19] church and the other one from the same
[1:16:21] church
[1:16:25] this
[1:16:27] one that's that's what we experience on
[1:16:30] a daily
[1:16:32] basis to
[1:16:36] misinterpret what the preacher is
[1:16:38] saying you know what causes that when
[1:16:42] you come to church you must pray for God
[1:16:46] to reveal
[1:16:48] the come with
[1:16:53] negativity negative come to church stay
[1:16:56] in the church
[1:16:58] negativity go home neity you will see
[1:17:05] 14 that's what causes that
[1:17:09] problem trying to open the channel this
[1:17:12] morning that sometimes just be a good
[1:17:17] listener and listen to the weight to
[1:17:20] flow in you without imagining
[1:17:25] when the preacher preach and say he's
[1:17:27] talking about
[1:17:30] me you're going to miss the
[1:17:34] whole amen amen it's not easy to be a
[1:17:38] preacher people will misinterpret
[1:17:41] you and make conclusion on what you
[1:17:45] saying finding that is a wrong
[1:17:48] thing now Jesus here had the same
[1:17:52] experience he said to the people I
[1:17:55] preach in parables in Parables you know
[1:17:58] when I preach about something you do not
[1:18:02] understand you
[1:18:03] live and when I
[1:18:06] continue others leave and when I
[1:18:09] continue the number is at
[1:18:13] minimum then I started to talk what I
[1:18:16] wanted to talk about you will grab it
[1:18:21] it's natural that is why start
[1:18:25] school at grade A until grade
[1:18:29] 12 when you look back only see maybe two
[1:18:34] or
[1:18:35] three the one that started with you
[1:18:38] from the rest just fall off
[1:18:42] on that's why you have people that left
[1:18:46] school
[1:18:48] earlier say x * X is X
[1:18:54] then the next class they say prove it
[1:18:59] you fail to prove it you leave school
[1:19:03] because it's like if I fail
[1:19:05] here what more about
[1:19:08] 12 what more about
[1:19:12] University it's what is happening in
[1:19:14] life what is happening in the church
[1:19:18] when the people do not understand they
[1:19:23] leave let
[1:19:26] God make you
[1:19:29] understand
[1:19:32] not un your own
[1:19:36] understand the word of God needs your
[1:19:40] heart your
[1:19:43] mind with
[1:19:48] you now here the Bible says I will utter
[1:19:53] things
[1:19:55] which have been kept
[1:19:58] secret from the foundation of the world
[1:20:01] I want you to understand that line
[1:20:04] because it's my key
[1:20:06] word keep
[1:20:10] secret from the foundation of the
[1:20:13] world that means from the foundation of
[1:20:15] the
[1:20:16] world a
[1:20:18] secret was
[1:20:21] kept even the angels do not know
[1:20:25] because it's with
[1:20:27] God then God at the right time will give
[1:20:32] it to the people whom he love not
[1:20:37] multitude but that
[1:20:39] minimum
[1:20:41] number that God
[1:20:44] has amen amen I've got few scriptures to
[1:20:47] read today and few quot from the
[1:20:51] prophet you to understand what I'm
[1:20:54] talking about
[1:20:55] because we need to fight from
[1:20:59] there if you can fight from
[1:21:01] there won't go
[1:21:04] wrong amen amen let's read another
[1:21:08] scripture that I want you to keep the
[1:21:10] key
[1:21:13] we Matthew
[1:21:15] 25 25 ver
[1:21:18] 34 Verse
[1:21:22] 34 then shall the king say unto them on
[1:21:26] his right hand Come Ye blessed of my
[1:21:29] father inherit the Kingdom prepared for
[1:21:32] you from the foundation of the world
[1:21:35] amen amen from the foundation of the
[1:21:39] world were
[1:21:41] happening first of all he kept a
[1:21:45] secret second he prepared a
[1:21:49] kingom those things he prepared them
[1:21:54] before there was
[1:21:55] anything but he kept them within
[1:22:00] himself a secret was kept a kingdom was
[1:22:06] prepared then all those things at the
[1:22:10] right time will be unveiled unto
[1:22:14] you this what brother is
[1:22:17] saying so this morning I'm just going to
[1:22:20] read those few
[1:22:22] scriptures so your understanding
[1:22:25] let's read another scripture in Romans
[1:22:29] chapter 9 chter
[1:22:33] 9 we will read from verse 11 until verse
[1:22:37] 16 Romans chapter 9 from verse 11 to
[1:22:41] 16 for the children being not yet born
[1:22:45] neither having done any good or evil
[1:22:48] that the purpose of God according to
[1:22:50] election might stand not of works but of
[1:22:54] him that cth it was said unto her the
[1:22:58] Elder Shall Serve the younger as it is
[1:23:01] written Jacob have I loved but alsoo
[1:23:04] have I hated what shall we say then is
[1:23:07] there unrighteousness with God God
[1:23:10] forbid for he said unto to Moses I will
[1:23:14] have mercy on whom I will have mercy and
[1:23:17] I will have compassion on whom I will
[1:23:19] have compassion so then it is not of him
[1:23:22] that will live nor of him that runneth
[1:23:26] but of God that showeth Mercy amen amen
[1:23:29] you see how God does
[1:23:32] things the children were
[1:23:36] born then he he do good to this
[1:23:40] one evil to this one because it's the
[1:23:44] election of
[1:23:45] God and this
[1:23:47] election before the children were born
[1:23:50] it was done before the foundation of the
[1:23:53] world
[1:23:55] so God is preparing his
[1:23:59] things at the right time we will just
[1:24:03] unveil and manifest and let the people
[1:24:07] know at the right time our God is a good
[1:24:12] planner he does not do things
[1:24:17] oppos now my key word here is the
[1:24:21] election of children
[1:24:24] before there was ever this
[1:24:27] world it was done there if you can fight
[1:24:30] from there you will never go
[1:24:35] wrong amen amen from where God elected
[1:24:40] you from where the kingdom was prepared
[1:24:42] for
[1:24:44] you where God kept all those
[1:24:47] secrets and they shall be known unto
[1:24:51] you amen amen when you look at things
[1:24:56] with the eyes of the
[1:24:58] world you will always mess up I was
[1:25:03] somewhere preaching then I was preaching
[1:25:07] about
[1:25:08] Abraham when he said to Sarah tell the
[1:25:11] people that we are
[1:25:15] brothers and you are my sister then we
[1:25:18] continue like that then they continue
[1:25:21] like that King mik
[1:25:27] when God come things were
[1:25:30] different look at the
[1:25:32] thing to high
[1:25:35] court to start with Abraham was wrong
[1:25:40] for telling the people that Abra Sarah
[1:25:44] is not his
[1:25:46] wife but look at the high court of
[1:25:51] Heaven condescended
[1:25:54] here to
[1:25:55] AB said to him it's my prophet's
[1:25:59] [Applause]
[1:26:01] wife looking at things through the eyes
[1:26:05] of the world and looking at things
[1:26:09] Through The Eyes Of
[1:26:11] Heaven they always
[1:26:14] contradict and then God said to you know
[1:26:18] AB you go to that man take his wife back
[1:26:22] to him
[1:26:24] even apologize and let him pray for you
[1:26:28] then he shall be
[1:26:30] blessed looking at the eyes of the
[1:26:33] World
[1:26:36] unfair how can I do
[1:26:39] wrong even
[1:26:43] apologize amen amen God do things
[1:26:48] differently and the way in his people
[1:26:53] way they were even punished by
[1:26:56] God they were sick they were baren but
[1:27:01] after he went to
[1:27:04] Abraham Abraham blessed him and pray for
[1:27:08] him things came back to
[1:27:11] noral God will always do things
[1:27:16] differently amen amen now here you will
[1:27:20] ask yourself a question again through
[1:27:23] the eyes of the world that here is
[1:27:27] Esau and Jacob but Jacob
[1:27:31] life not like the way supposed to
[1:27:35] be God said I love Jacob because I hate
[1:27:40] is Through The Eyes of the world so
[1:27:44] unfair but Through The Eyes Of God it's
[1:27:49] fair do you know the reason behind
[1:27:53] this is looking at
[1:27:56] you of what he see before
[1:28:01] him the Bible
[1:28:04] says the young one
[1:28:08] you real you behold the face of the
[1:28:14] father if you are face be hold the face
[1:28:18] of the father no matter what is
[1:28:21] happening world you are
[1:28:26] God God is looking at
[1:28:28] that brother says you redeemed
[1:28:33] soul is what makes everything like the
[1:28:36] way they
[1:28:37] are so when God was looking at the soul
[1:28:40] of
[1:28:42] Esau is not beholding his
[1:28:45] face but Jacob behold the face of the
[1:28:50] father irrespective of the condition
[1:28:54] God will protect
[1:28:56] Jacob even change his name to
[1:29:02] Israel amen amen it was always like
[1:29:07] that let's read another
[1:29:10] scripture then you will I will go to the
[1:29:13] Cotes God is doing things
[1:29:18] differ let's go to um Hebrews
[1:29:33] 4:3 Hebrews
[1:29:36] 4:3 for we which have believed do enter
[1:29:40] into rest as he said as I have sown in
[1:29:43] my wrath if they shall enter into my
[1:29:46] rest although the works were finished
[1:29:49] from the foundation of the
[1:29:51] world I just wanted to show you this you
[1:29:55] see I'm reading the Bible always these
[1:29:59] things were done before the F Of The
[1:30:02] World God kept
[1:30:07] them and it settled
[1:30:09] everything for you to fight the devil
[1:30:12] you must know yourself you must know
[1:30:15] your position the foundation of the
[1:30:17] world if you don't see yourself there
[1:30:21] your effort will never help
[1:30:24] I'm just trying to to help you again
[1:30:27] that my key words here is the work was
[1:30:32] finished before the foundation
[1:30:35] of Amen so everything was it's like a
[1:30:39] package that has contained everything
[1:30:43] inside and you have them not sharing
[1:30:46] with anyone but waiting for the right
[1:30:49] time start unfolding and sharing to the
[1:30:53] people
[1:30:54] so everything that God is
[1:30:56] doing done before the
[1:30:58] found you read Ephesians chapter 1 we
[1:31:02] can read we are at church then I'll show
[1:31:05] you the code
[1:31:06] later verse
[1:31:08] four to
[1:31:11] 5 according as he has chosen Us in him
[1:31:14] before the foundation of the world that
[1:31:17] we should be holy and Without Blame
[1:31:19] before him in love having predestinated
[1:31:23] us unto the the adoption of children by
[1:31:25] Jesus Christ to himself amen amen ACC
[1:31:29] according as he has
[1:31:37] chosen before the foundation of the
[1:31:39] world he chose us he predestinated us so
[1:31:45] my key words
[1:31:47] there he chosen us and predestinated us
[1:31:52] [Applause]
[1:31:54] if you can see yourself from that
[1:31:58] point you will never have
[1:32:01] problems we have problem in this world
[1:32:04] because we want to put our own
[1:32:07] thinking word of God I sometimes tell
[1:32:11] the people there just be a good
[1:32:19] follower you just full and the next
[1:32:22] thing you do
[1:32:25] following and that's it there's a
[1:32:29] benefit of
[1:32:33] [Applause]
[1:32:35] following you know we haven't done
[1:32:37] anything good
[1:32:40] to but he chose
[1:32:43] us before the foundation
[1:32:46] of the best thing we can do because he
[1:32:50] chose us we must just follow him
[1:32:53] [Applause]
[1:32:56] [Music]
[1:32:58] amen all our efforts should just be
[1:33:01] finished just follow the people don't
[1:33:04] want to follow they want
[1:33:08] position and they fight for the
[1:33:11] position know in the world motivational
[1:33:15] speakers will tell you
[1:33:18] that for you to be
[1:33:22] successful and after
[1:33:29] fighting I met this friend of
[1:33:31] mine he's a very successful man in
[1:33:37] mining then we were talking about
[1:33:40] business the other
[1:33:41] day he said to me in business you don't

[1:33:50] kill then I said said no no no not
[1:33:55] literally I mean to to tend the
[1:34:00] tender killing I'm talking about but to
[1:34:04] my

[1:41:44] not redeemed with corruptable things as
[1:41:48] silver and gold from your vain
[1:41:51] conversation received by a tradition
[1:41:54] from your fathers but with the precious
[1:41:57] blood of Christ as of a lamp without
[1:42:00] blemish and without spot who verely was
[1:42:04] for ordained before the foundation of
[1:42:06] the world but was manifest in this last
[1:42:10] time for you amen amen my key word there
[1:42:14] from
[1:42:15] verse for
[1:42:17] ordained before the foundation of the
[1:42:20] world and he manifest those things
[1:42:24] in this last
[1:42:30] time in this last
[1:42:38] time let's let's read it who very was
[1:42:42] for ordained before the foundation of
[1:42:44] the world but was manifest in this last
[1:42:47] time for you

[1:43:01] you done to deserve
[1:43:07] this he just love you and then after
[1:43:11] loving you give all those
[1:43:14] secrets you prepare a
[1:43:18] city

[1:43:29] is finished it says you don't add you
[1:43:33] don't minus you live as it
[1:43:36] is job what God did and then who who we
[1:43:42] are
[1:43:44] today is the completion of God's
[1:43:47] [Music]
[1:43:49] work he trusted you to be in this last
[1:43:53] time because when he look at his program
[1:43:57] he saw you finishing his

[1:44:14] this C because
[1:44:17] [Music]
[1:44:21] after that has God doing all those
[1:44:24] things so if God is doing this if you
[1:44:28] ask yourself question if God doing this
[1:44:32] for
[1:44:33] us what more do we need to
[1:44:39] do be a good
[1:44:42] follower a job is
[1:44:44] complete what more do you
[1:44:50] want unless we are waiting for something
[1:44:53] El if we are not waiting for some else
[1:44:58] we are in the same
[1:45:00] course let's just
[1:45:03] relax and let
[1:45:06] God finish his
[1:45:08] work with his work because all those
[1:45:12] things were in him little by
[1:45:16] little
[1:45:21] unfolding brothers and sisters
[1:45:23] we've got a spoken we called Seven
[1:45:28] Seals you will read it and read it and
[1:45:32] at the end not understand whats
[1:45:37] are until you
[1:45:40] wait for God to tell you what
[1:45:45] [Applause]
[1:45:46] Isen amen amen it was always like
[1:45:50] that now I'm going to to read the last
[1:45:53] scripture then I'll go to the quotes
[1:45:57] Revelation chapter
[1:46:01] 13 then at the end of the
[1:46:04] service you will be knowing
[1:46:08] that you are a Believer or
[1:46:14] not
[1:46:21] amen sometimes when you go to
[1:46:23] church we just vers 8 18 chapter 13 uh
[1:46:27] chapter 13:8 chapter 13 Revelation verse
[1:46:33] 8 and all that dwell upon the Earth
[1:46:36] shall worship Him whose names are not
[1:46:39] written in the Book of Life of the lamb
[1:46:42] slain from the foundation of the world
[1:46:45] amen amen my key words here is whose
[1:46:50] name were not written
[1:46:53] and the other one is a lamp was
[1:46:56] slain from the foundation of the world

[1:47:03] lamb be
[1:47:05] slain before the foundation of the world
[1:47:08] while we see Jesus on the

[1:47:58] 2024 being a
[1:48:00] sinner and he applied that
[1:48:03] blood from the foundation of the world
[1:48:07] when he applied that blood it was what
[1:48:10] he
[1:48:15] had well all those
[1:48:18] things the lamb that was slain the L
[1:48:21] that were WR

[2:01:38] [Music]
[2:01:42] know go and read the life story of
[2:01:47] brother as a
[2:01:49] teenager had a challeng
[2:01:52] as an adult he challenge as he get older
[2:01:57] he
[2:01:58] [Music]
[2:02:00] challenges but our God

[2:02:38] do God doing
[2:02:42] it brother as a
[2:02:45] person up protected him you as a person
[2:02:50] mess up but God is protecting
[2:02:57] you because this
[2:02:59] flesh
[2:03:02] [Music]
[2:03:05] issues that's we
[2:03:11] one if you can see somebody undermining
[2:03:14] you
[2:03:17] [Applause]
[2:03:18] just
[2:03:20] because undermine another
[2:03:23] soul
[2:03:25] soul Embrace another
[2:03:28] Soul cannot say who do you think you are
[2:03:33] a soul from God
[2:03:36] [Applause]
[2:03:42] never that's I'm going to show him and I
[2:03:44] will deal with him
[2:03:57] you are still dealing with one another
[2:03:59] we see what God has for us brother here
[2:04:04] a man running from the Pres of the
[2:04:08] Lord amen amen he said God he just chose
[2:04:14] the
[2:04:18] Jews God doing
[2:04:20] it with
[2:04:23] because you can say why didn't he choose
[2:04:25] the
[2:04:26] Chinese because when God
[2:04:30] Cho now he's being accused for not
[2:04:32] choosing the
[2:04:34] others what is it that satisfies a
[2:04:39] man always have
[2:04:42] question always
[2:04:46] analy and even put his mouth
[2:04:51] oh now it's
[2:04:55] flesh but when I read what the prophet
[2:04:57] is saying
[2:05:01] here was
[2:05:03] called for
[2:05:04] chosen for God's chosen
[2:05:08] people they were
[2:05:10] chosen for a specific
[2:05:16] CA and that CA was to give them
[2:05:23] the law that's the reason why God chose
[2:05:28] them so that we may know how law
[2:05:32] operates and they could not keep
[2:05:35] it everybody
[2:05:38] failed under the
[2:05:42] law that was the reason why chose
[2:05:47] them as to why he didn't choose the
[2:05:50] Greeks I don't know
[2:05:52] God chose the
[2:05:56] jewi and he just
[2:05:59] show by that people that the law could
[2:06:04] not be
[2:06:08] kept and the
[2:06:10] law demand
[2:06:14] righteousness but there's no Grace in
[2:06:18] law to bring a man out
[2:06:22] no
[2:06:23] penalty was paid by the
[2:06:26] law but taken
[2:06:29] Grace to pay that
[2:06:33] penalty or to wear the law put us
[2:06:38] under amen amen God just take a
[2:06:43] law put it in
[2:06:45] Israel Israel became the chosen nation
[2:06:49] of God
[2:06:51] you know what the people will always
[2:06:54] say why did he choose the
[2:06:56] jeice it looks like something is not
[2:06:58] going well
[2:07:01] here the white people are there those
[2:07:03] are the people the people are hardly
[2:07:08] believe what is happening in their
[2:07:13] surrounding they are hardly
[2:07:16] believed everything that is happening a
[2:07:19] question but if God chose CH Jewish
[2:07:23] instead of just saying
[2:07:25] amen God chose the Bride inste of saying
[2:07:30] am we will question
[2:07:36] God that's a nature of a human
[2:07:38] being
[2:07:41] interrogating that's what we learn on a
[2:07:43] daily
[2:07:44] basis why not this
[2:07:49] but amen amen until when God gave Holy
[2:07:53] Ghost to Peter
[2:07:56] and
[2:07:58] all then because they didn't have they
[2:08:02] wanted to
[2:08:04] buy you know that SCP in Acts where
[2:08:07] people wanted to buy Holy Ghost because
[2:08:11] they saw Holy Ghost Mir and they don't
[2:08:15] receive they were
[2:08:17] studying how they get those things
[2:08:21] realize that all and them clo in the
[2:08:25] house they pray and then they think by
[2:08:29] getting the Holy Ghost they must pray
[2:08:33] they went and pray they didn't receive
[2:08:36] they think oh maybe by going to you know
[2:08:38] people can investigate you follow you
[2:08:43] wherever you go and they come to church
[2:08:46] they realize oh in the church this
[2:08:48] message
[2:08:51] and they follow because they wanted the
[2:08:53] Holy Ghost and at the end they
[2:08:57] concluded no it's not by praying it's
[2:09:01] not by going to church it's not by doing
[2:09:03] this let's just give them money M you
[2:09:06] know money if we give themy the business
[2:09:09] people
[2:09:13] Sayes if you have money you can turn the
[2:09:16] world
[2:09:17] around if you find some difficulties
[2:09:21] and you have money things are easy
[2:09:25] that's why people with money are
[2:09:29] arrogant because when you talk they can
[2:09:32] tell you I can buy
[2:09:37] you I'm not talking about you I was just
[2:09:42] those yes those one are the one that
[2:09:47] came to church and to buy the Holy Ghost
[2:09:53] with money because they have
[2:09:55] many but little did they know that Holy
[2:10:00] Ghost you don't get it money but you get
[2:10:04] it when God decid to give it to
[2:10:10] you because he give you
[2:10:16] [Applause]
[2:10:18] himself amen amen
[2:10:22] Faith once delivered to the Saints amen
[2:10:24] it's a spoken wayen brother Bram says if
[2:10:28] you haven't receive the Holy Ghost Holy
[2:10:32] Spirit there's a place prepared for
[2:10:36] you in God's
[2:10:39] kingdom that God wants to bring you into
[2:10:44] it and you can receive the Holy

[2:14:20] Bible say
[2:14:21] that's where wisdom
[2:14:25] [Music]
[2:14:27] is you know politics in
[2:14:31] church this will analyze

[2:15:51] of what they
[2:15:53] have in the
[2:15:56] flesh if you don't have a big car if you
