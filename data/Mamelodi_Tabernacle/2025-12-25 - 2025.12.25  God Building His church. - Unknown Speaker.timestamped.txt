[1:27:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:03] &gt;&gt; Now, brethren,
[1:27:08] I just want us to go through our dress
[1:27:10] code.
[1:27:15] I think we need to repeat this again.
[1:27:20] And we are praying for brethren to take
[1:27:22] this very seriously.
[1:27:28] God bless you.
[1:27:31] This is coming from
[1:27:34] our board and from our pastor as well.
[1:27:40] Our brother will just read through
[1:27:43] it read that announcement on dress code.
[1:27:47] The pastor and the church board have
[1:27:49] observed a concerning trend where some
[1:27:52] members appear to be drifting away from
[1:27:55] the standard of modest apparel as taught
[1:27:58] in scriptures. 1 Timothy 2:9.
[1:28:03] This behavior risks h bringing reproach
[1:28:06] upon the church and undermining our
[1:28:09] testimony. We kindly urge all members to
[1:28:12] uphold biblical modesty in dress and
[1:28:16] conduct. Should this matter persist, the
[1:28:19] pastor and the board may be compelled to
[1:28:22] address individuals who do not comply in
[1:28:26] order to maintain order and holiness
[1:28:30] within the body of Christ.
[1:28:33] &gt;&gt; Can I give round of applause?
[1:28:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:28:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So I think we are taking
[1:28:40] this in another level
[1:28:44] and God bless you as we are doing that.
[1:28:49] We've got the Okay.
[1:28:54] All right.
[1:28:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:28:56] All right. Thank you so much, Brethren.
[1:28:58] At this time,
[1:29:01] we've got our pastor, Pastor Maka in the
[1:29:04] house.
[1:29:09] Hallelujah.
[1:29:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:29:11] &gt;&gt; As he approached the pullpit,
[1:29:15] we've got the children dedication.

[1:32:00] [music]
[1:32:04] to us.
[1:32:12] Greetings, brethren.
[1:32:18] We are happy to be with you.
[1:32:23] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[1:32:28] &gt;&gt; May the the God of peace do you well
[1:32:35] &gt;&gt; ask my [applause] brother
[1:32:39] &gt;&gt; to read the Bible
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; Mark chapter 10 from verse 13-16
[1:32:46] and they brought young children to him
[1:32:48] that he should touch them and his
[1:32:51] disciple rebuked those that brought
[1:32:53] them. But when Jesus saw it, he was much
[1:32:56] displeased and said unto them, Suffer
[1:32:58] the little children to come unto me and
[1:33:00] forbid them not, for of such is the
[1:33:03] kingdom of God. Verily, I say unto you,
[1:33:06] whosoever shall not receive the kingdom
[1:33:09] of God as a little child, he shall not
[1:33:11] enter therein. And he took them up in
[1:33:14] his arms, put his hands upon them, and
[1:33:17] blessed them.
[1:33:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:19] I believe
[1:33:21] those disciples were saying
[1:33:25] these are not our members.
[1:33:29] They're not worshiping with us.
[1:33:32] Why?
[1:33:34] Jesus said, "Allah little children,
[1:33:39] let them come."
[1:33:42] And then the Bible says he took them in.
[1:33:46] I believe this also have brought their
[1:33:50] children to him.
[1:33:54] Not to an ordinary man
[1:34:01] but to him.
[1:34:05] He it pleased him
[1:34:09] to use man
[1:34:11] as his agency.
[1:34:18] When we trace him, sorry, when we trace
[1:34:21] him,
[1:34:22] we find always
[1:34:26] he works behind the veil
[1:34:31] and that veil is a man.
[1:34:35] Hey, these sisters must believe today
[1:34:41] because it takes their faith
[1:34:45] that they have brought their children to
[1:34:47] him.
[1:34:50] God will honor their faith.
[1:34:54] I'm going to use my hands
[1:34:59] which are born of a woman
[1:35:04] born in sin and shame iniquity
[1:35:09] but by the grace of God
[1:35:12] I have found grace in his eyes.
[1:35:17] That's why I'm standing here in his
[1:35:21] place.
[1:35:24] That is the name of this one.
[1:35:30] &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father,
[1:35:33] there is a child, young girl
[1:35:38] in this age
[1:35:40] where Satan has
[1:35:43] rose so much more attacking the children
[1:35:49] even from
[1:35:51] young age.
[1:35:53] We are praying for this one,
[1:35:58] asking you to keep this one.
[1:36:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:01] &gt;&gt; For the sake of the faith of their
[1:36:03] parents.
[1:36:04] &gt;&gt; Yes, sir.
[1:36:04] &gt;&gt; In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[1:36:06] Amen.
[1:36:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:09] &gt;&gt; Is it a girl or a boy?
[1:36:11] &gt;&gt; A girl.
[1:36:16] &gt;&gt; Thank you.
[1:36:20] placing this child in my hand.
[1:36:24] &gt;&gt; I believe it's the wish of her parents
[1:36:29] that in future he may be in the choir
[1:36:34] singing for the Lord.
[1:36:37] &gt;&gt; God
[1:36:39] do what their parents are thinking good
[1:36:43] about this child. The name of the Lord
[1:36:46] Jesus Christ. Amen.
[1:36:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:56] Lord, these are the two children
[1:36:59] brought by their parents.
[1:37:02] You know the hearts of their parents.
[1:37:05] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[1:37:06] &gt;&gt; The wish of their parents
[1:37:09] about these two children.
[1:37:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:37:12] &gt;&gt; God bless the children. Give their
[1:37:15] parents the desire of their hearts.
[1:37:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. In the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:37:20] Christ. Amen.
[1:37:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:24] [applause]
[1:37:30] &gt;&gt; I've got girls here.
[1:37:36] Let's pray.
[1:37:39] Father,
[1:37:41] into thy hand
[1:37:44] I'm dedicating this child this morning
[1:37:48] unto you.
[1:37:51] I put her
[1:37:54] into your care.
[1:37:56] Look after her. Protect her.
[1:38:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:00] &gt;&gt; I pray
[1:38:02] &gt;&gt; in the precious name of our savior Lord
[1:38:04] Jesus [music] Christ. Amen.
[1:38:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:10] God bless you.
[1:38:13] &gt;&gt; God bless you my brother. God bless my
[1:38:15] sister. God bless you. God bless you.
[1:38:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:38:28] &gt;&gt; While sitting down,
[1:38:32] &gt;&gt; I've got um something to announce here.
[1:38:40] Elderle came to me
[1:38:44] said he wanted to come and fellowship
[1:38:46] with the children of God.
[1:38:52] Then I I came from Luen and I came here
[1:38:59] to see him.
[1:39:02] Why is he not worshiping?
[1:39:06] Then he told me why
[1:39:09] then I have still having his reasons
[1:39:13] with me
[1:39:17] and still some of them I'm still
[1:39:19] investigating them
[1:39:24] but I've allowed him to come and worship
[1:39:34] but If perhaps I found it otherwise
[1:39:39] and I say go back
[1:39:43] and don't wonder
[1:39:46] don't you must not wonder say why
[1:39:52] because I said I'm still having
[1:40:01] his son
[1:40:03] has not come to me.
[1:40:06] But I believe he's in the house.
[1:40:11] He had to come to me.
[1:40:15] He must come to see me
[1:40:19] so that he mustn't just come into the
[1:40:21] service
[1:40:23] without see me first.
[1:40:27] But if he's in the service, he is
[1:40:29] welcome.
[1:40:31] Amite.
[1:40:34] [applause]
[1:40:42] &gt;&gt; God bless you all.
[1:40:45] And
[1:40:47] while we sing our song,
[1:40:52] &gt;&gt; then
[1:40:54] we will stand on our feet.

[1:43:16] [singing]
[1:43:18] &gt;&gt; Holy Ghost.
[1:43:20] [music]
[1:43:24] Amen.
[1:43:25] Uh [applause] I'm happy
[1:43:29] &gt;&gt; but uh I just going to ask you to sit
[1:43:32] down very well
[1:43:36] &gt;&gt; because I want my technical team to
[1:43:39] flesh some clips
[1:43:47] before I start
[1:43:50] because
[1:43:52] Pastor Edgar is listening
[1:43:58] and he's going to ask me
[1:44:01] pastor
[1:44:03] what was happening in the church
[1:44:07] but I must be able to answer
[1:44:12] you there is another one start while we
[1:44:16] are preaching here we are preaching just
[1:44:19] to a small
[1:44:21] group
[1:44:25] not the other churches.
[1:44:29] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Our way our our way here
[1:44:33] &gt;&gt; is going to the heart not to the church.
[1:44:39] &gt;&gt; That's why
[1:44:42] some are say are talking about the
[1:44:48] fivefold ministry
[1:44:50] but they don't know what is fivefold.
[1:44:53] ministry.
[1:44:55] &gt;&gt; All right, we've got them here.
[1:45:00] They didn't prepare them for us
[1:45:04] only. We don't we also don't make use of
[1:45:07] them.
[1:45:09] That's why we will go
[1:45:13] the other way.
[1:45:15] Okay, let us go back to the church
[1:45:18] order.
[1:45:21] If each and every one of us,
[1:45:28] &gt;&gt; we can get a copy
[1:45:31] &gt;&gt; and look at the church order.
[1:45:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:45:35] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:45:38] Thank you. Technical team.
[1:45:46] That's why people call me
[1:45:52] church order.
[1:45:52] &gt;&gt; This pastor of yours, Pastor of Church
[1:45:55] order,
[1:45:56] &gt;&gt; I will I will never leave church order
[1:46:01] [applause]
[1:46:03] &gt;&gt; because
[1:46:05] if I can leave church order,
[1:46:08] &gt;&gt; I'm going to be biased.
[1:46:14] &gt;&gt; I'm not I'm not going to judge things
[1:46:18] the same way.
[1:46:21] If it is
[1:46:23] then I'll say so
[1:46:26] then if
[1:46:29] &gt;&gt; then I will say so. But if I always keep
[1:46:33] to church order
[1:46:36] as my pastor has said
[1:46:41] he announce it here in the church.
[1:46:45] It's not something which is in the
[1:46:47] corners.
[1:46:50] is it was spoken
[1:46:53] &gt;&gt; in the church.
[1:46:57] &gt;&gt; There are things which come from
[1:46:58] corners.
[1:47:02] I don't care about this.
[1:47:04] [applause]
[1:47:08] You may say them the way you want to say
[1:47:11] them.
[1:47:15] You will never touch me.
[1:47:20] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[1:47:20] &gt;&gt; another trip.
[1:47:26] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Now remember
[1:47:30] &gt;&gt; when we after this
[1:47:35] &gt;&gt; I'll come with that church church order.
[1:47:41] &gt;&gt; It will help us to keep the order.
[1:47:50] How many would love to keep?
[1:47:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:47:59] &gt;&gt; While we are preaching here, we are
[1:48:02] preaching just to a small
[1:48:04] group.
[1:48:07] &gt;&gt; Thank you. You are repeating the same
[1:48:09] thing.
[1:48:13] &gt;&gt; Another one if you have it.
[1:48:18] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[1:48:21] &gt;&gt; My d would have failed me.

[1:48:51] &gt;&gt; We may we met
[1:48:54] way back
[1:48:57] and I called him my son.
[1:49:01] I don't know why
[1:49:04] but later after that I understood why
[1:49:10] and now here today
[1:49:13] &gt;&gt; I am fed by myself.
[1:49:17] [applause and cheering]
[1:49:21] &gt;&gt; Thank you technical team.
[1:49:22] &gt;&gt; So wonderful
[1:49:24] technical team
[1:49:27] those who say
[1:49:31] Those
[1:49:35] or those who say that pastor of yours,
[1:49:38] &gt;&gt; my pastor said
[1:49:41] I am your pastor.
[1:49:44] [applause]
[1:49:48] &gt;&gt; You clapped the hands
[1:49:52] when he was saying that.
[1:49:57] [applause]
[1:49:59] But now you want to turn back
[1:50:07] [applause]
[1:50:11] &gt;&gt; and you will not you will you will never
[1:50:13] drive me from this pull pit.
[1:50:19] [applause]
[1:50:21] No demon in hell
[1:50:26] will be able to push me.
[1:50:32] All right, you can play this one.
[1:50:43] &gt;&gt; Not destined for you for the announce
[1:50:50] not not a rumor.
[1:50:54] No, it must officially
[1:50:57] be announced
[1:51:01] &gt;&gt; from the pulpit. If it is not announced
[1:51:05] from the pulpit,
[1:51:07] then it's a a rumor, an unfounded rumor.
[1:51:12] So wait for the announcement
[1:51:15] announcement.
[1:51:20] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[1:51:21] &gt;&gt; What I'm doing is what my pastor said.
[1:51:27] Everything
[1:51:28] must be announced from the pulpit,
[1:51:34] not from the corners.
[1:51:41] Have you heard him?
[1:51:46] He said if you call me you are Lord.
[1:51:49] That is Jesus said
[1:51:52] but if you call your pastor
[1:51:57] if you call him your pastor
[1:52:00] you must listen to him.
[1:52:04] [applause]
[1:52:07] All right, let me read something here
[1:52:10] is from my pastor
[1:52:14] pastor.
[1:52:16] &gt;&gt; He said
[1:52:17] shalom
[1:52:19] shalom.
[1:52:20] &gt;&gt; I kindly
[1:52:23] can I kindly be recused from all formal
[1:52:26] meetings in
[1:52:33] I have no desire to be involved.
[1:52:39] I believe that pastor
[1:52:43] will deal with whatever matters arising.
[1:52:50] Who is saying this
[1:52:52] pastor?
[1:52:54] Those who say pastor pastor
[1:52:59] here
[1:53:01] he says pastor
[1:53:04] will deal with everything
[1:53:08] in
[1:53:12] now you will remain with your lie.
[1:53:22] I want those who are children of God,
[1:53:26] they must know the truth.
[1:53:35] &gt;&gt; I want you to bring a quote there.
[1:53:43] Tonight
[1:53:45] we are trying to take the word of God
[1:53:50] and use it.
[1:53:52] by the power of the Holy Spirit
[1:53:56] to blow all the indifferences
[1:54:01] and doubts
[1:54:04] away from us.
[1:54:06] All those little light flashy things
[1:54:13] that that that just doesn't have any
[1:54:17] foundation
[1:54:20] and doesn't have any weight
[1:54:24] in our life. We want to blow it away
[1:54:30] so that we can find the glorious vein.
[1:54:36] The vein is Christ.
[1:54:41] [applause]
[1:54:43] To find the glorious vein,
[1:54:46] we are going to use the wind
[1:54:50] to blow every little thing.
[1:54:54] That's why I'm using clips here.
[1:54:58] I'm blowing all the rubbish
[1:55:04] so that we can remain
[1:55:07] with the reality
[1:55:11] and I've commanded the the deacons
[1:55:16] to arrest
[1:55:21] anything this which is kept out of the
[1:55:23] church
[1:55:25] out of church order they is arrest
[1:55:31] [applause]
[1:55:34] because we are not playing here
[1:55:36] is a church.
[1:55:39] [applause]
[1:55:44] If they don't arrest
[1:55:47] then I will take them away from their
[1:55:48] position.
[1:55:51] I will take I will choose another deacon
[1:55:55] who will arrest
[1:56:01] bring the docket to me
[1:56:06] with the judgment
[1:56:11] then I will check it
[1:56:13] whether what you are saying is true
[1:56:17] if it is true because I want the
[1:56:19] evidence
[1:56:23] I don't want what you tell me he said
[1:56:25] this is a
[1:56:27] You must bring evidence.
[1:56:31] Then
[1:56:33] &gt;&gt; I shall ask him or her.
[1:56:36] &gt;&gt; I will I will
[1:56:39] say to
[1:56:42] I will ask them to just excuse
[1:56:46] themselves
[1:56:49] from from us.
[1:56:53] [applause]
[1:56:58] Because for the church to fail
[1:57:02] there was there was a there
[1:57:07] innocent people die
[1:57:11] because of Achen
[1:57:14] I don't want innocent people to die here
[1:57:18] because of many Yeah,
[1:57:23] [applause]
[1:57:26] they must arrest.
[1:57:34] &gt;&gt; I tell you,
[1:57:36] &gt;&gt; you'll see things.
[1:57:39] [cheering]
[1:57:40] [applause]
[1:57:45] Another one.
[1:57:52] &gt;&gt; I truly believe that every word of God,
[1:57:58] every promise
[1:58:01] that he made is just true
[1:58:06] and it is to anybody
[1:58:10] will accept it.
[1:58:13] And now there is some who try to accept
[1:58:16] it
[1:58:19] and cannot.
[1:58:23] Some try
[1:58:25] to accept it but they cannot.
[1:58:30] Why? I will tell you.
[1:58:32] There is others who can accept
[1:58:37] and some get it
[1:58:41] without half trying.
[1:58:48] That is that we have to preach the
[1:58:51] gospel
[1:58:54] that healing is for all.
[1:58:58] Yet we know it is not.
[1:59:04] It is to all if they can receive it.
[1:59:10] But we know that
[1:59:13] they all cannot receive it.
[1:59:19] But when we preach, we say healing is
[1:59:21] for all.
[1:59:23] But we know it's not for all.
[1:59:31] I just want to be as honest with you as
[1:59:34] I know how to be.
[1:59:40] We have to preach salvation
[1:59:45] the same way
[1:59:47] that salvation is for all
[1:59:50] but we know that all cannot receive him.
[1:59:56] All men cannot see these things.
[2:00:02] Jesus said, "Blessed are your eyes
[2:00:07] that can see
[2:00:10] your understanding,
[2:00:12] for there is many that cannot
[2:00:14] understand."
[2:00:19] Stand up on your feet.
[2:00:22] [applause]
[2:00:26] Let's open the book of Matthew.
[2:00:31] &gt;&gt; Matthew chapter 16.
[2:00:34] &gt;&gt; Matthew 16
[2:00:36] &gt;&gt; 13- 20.
[2:00:37] &gt;&gt; Uh 13- 18.
[2:00:40] &gt;&gt; 13- 20
[2:00:41] &gt;&gt; or 13- 20.
[2:00:44] When Jesus came into the coast of Cesia
[2:00:47] Philip, he asked his disciples, saying,
[2:00:50] "Whom do men say I, the son of man, am?"
[2:00:54] And they said, "Some say that thou art
[2:00:56] John the Baptist, some Elias, and others
[2:00:59] Jeremiah's or one of the prophets." He
[2:01:03] said unto them, "But whom say ye that I
[2:01:06] am?" And Simon Peter answered and said,
[2:01:08] "Thou art the Christ, the Son of the
[2:01:11] living God?" And Jesus answered and said
[2:01:14] unto him, Blessed are thou Simon Bjonah,
[2:01:17] for flesh and blood hath not revealed it
[2:01:20] unto thee, but my father which is in
[2:01:23] heaven. And I say also unto thee, that
[2:01:27] thou art Peter, and upon this rock I
[2:01:30] will build my church, and the gates of
[2:01:33] hell shall not prevail against it. And I
[2:01:36] will give unto thee the keys of the
[2:01:38] kingdom of heaven. And whatsoever thou
[2:01:41] shalt bind on earth shall be bound in
[2:01:44] heaven. And whatsoever thou shalt lose
[2:01:47] on earth shall be loosed in heaven.
[2:01:51] Let's just close our eyes.
[2:01:55] &gt;&gt; My dear heavenly father,
[2:01:58] standing here
[2:02:02] &gt;&gt; through your mercy.
[2:02:06] I'm not prone to stand here,
[2:02:10] but by grace
[2:02:13] I'm not better than all the people who
[2:02:16] are sitting down there
[2:02:18] because you know their hearts
[2:02:21] &gt;&gt; and you know my hearts too.
[2:02:24] But I pray heavenly father.
[2:02:28] Use my voice
[2:02:31] &gt;&gt; and my brother's voice.
[2:02:33] Let us convey
[2:02:36] &gt;&gt; your message to your children.
[2:02:39] &gt;&gt; Not what I wish
[2:02:42] but your message.
[2:02:44] &gt;&gt; I pray heavenly father in the name of
[2:02:47] the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen.
[2:02:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:50] &gt;&gt; You may take your seat.
[2:03:01] I'm going to have a very small topic
[2:03:09] and that topic will be
[2:03:13] God building his church.
[2:03:21] I'm not going to preach
[2:03:25] but to teach.
[2:03:27] I'm not I'm going to try to do that
[2:03:33] because in fact preaching
[2:03:36] preaching
[2:03:38] is for sinners
[2:03:43] and sinners don't like preaching.
[2:03:49] But teaching
[2:03:51] is for believers,
[2:03:54] &gt;&gt; the bride,
[2:03:55] &gt;&gt; not for sinners.
[2:03:59] &gt;&gt; Let me read in this book of adoption,
[2:04:03] adoption,
[2:04:04] &gt;&gt; um, paragraph six, paragraph six.
[2:04:08] &gt;&gt; Bible teaching is usually a treacherous
[2:04:16] Amen.
[2:04:21] and lately you know kind of
[2:04:25] working out of the thin ice
[2:04:31] we call it but we just feel that maybe
[2:04:36] at this point at this time it might be
[2:04:41] good
[2:04:42] to kind of bring the church to what I
[2:04:46] thing,
[2:04:50] a complete understanding
[2:04:55] positionally
[2:04:57] for what we are in Christ
[2:05:03] and sometimes
[2:05:05] I think that preaching is wonderful
[2:05:07] thing
[2:05:11] but I believe sometimes
[2:05:13] brother
[2:05:15] that teaching goes beyond that.
[2:05:20] A kind of a kind of a special especially
[2:05:24] in the church.
[2:05:27] Now preaching usually catches the sinner
[2:05:33] bring him under condemnation
[2:05:38] by the weight. But teaching
[2:05:42] places man
[2:05:45] positionally what he is.
[2:05:49] And we can never rightly be able to have
[2:05:52] faith
[2:05:55] until positionally.
[2:05:59] We know what we are.
[2:06:04] I'm saying
[2:06:06] preaching is for sinners.
[2:06:10] In other words,
[2:06:12] &gt;&gt; I can't come here
[2:06:14] &gt;&gt; and preach to you
[2:06:17] &gt;&gt; because you are the bride.
[2:06:22] How can I preach to the bride?
[2:06:26] Because the bride is called.
[2:06:30] The Bible says many are called
[2:06:34] but few
[2:06:36] are chosen.
[2:06:38] And the few chosen
[2:06:41] is the bride.
[2:06:43] Amen. And when he was revealing the
[2:06:45] seals,
[2:06:48] he was collecting his subject
[2:06:53] to together.
[2:06:56] And the bride is the seed of God.
[2:07:01] that now at this time
[2:07:04] God is collecting his seat
[2:07:08] because now the the the shark
[2:07:13] has moved away
[2:07:16] from the shark.
[2:07:19] The shark has moved away
[2:07:23] from the seat
[2:07:25] to allow the seat
[2:07:28] to be contact with the sun.
[2:07:33] But you see when we are looking at the
[2:07:36] development of the seed,
[2:07:41] it start by the blade there.
[2:07:45] When it moves there, it becomes a stock.
[2:07:50] But when it becomes a stop,
[2:07:52] the leaves remain there,
[2:07:56] but they are now dry.
[2:08:00] But they still there.
[2:08:03] But they are dry. Why been there? They
[2:08:07] are waiting for the harvest time.
[2:08:11] When they when the harvest has come,
[2:08:15] they will be bent
[2:08:17] after the seed is taken up.
[2:08:20] Then these other things
[2:08:22] will be bent.
[2:08:25] Amen.
[2:08:28] &gt;&gt; Now
[2:08:31] the bride
[2:08:32] is the seat.
[2:08:34] &gt;&gt; God has already gathered his
[2:08:40] Amen. Amen.
[2:08:42] &gt;&gt; When he revealed the seals,
[2:08:46] the Bible says God revealed the seals
[2:08:51] and they see them
[2:08:55] because they are ordained
[2:08:59] to see.
[2:09:01] But those who are not ordained
[2:09:04] that's why always you will say when you
[2:09:08] say he is no more my immediate
[2:09:11] they will say why what in other words
[2:09:13] you mean we are not safe
[2:09:18] and we don't wonder
[2:09:20] when
[2:09:23] we we don't wonder when people say that
[2:09:28] because
[2:09:30] If you [snorts] don't know marble hall
[2:09:34] and you were taught about marble hall
[2:09:38] you see sometime another man
[2:09:42] and can tell you otherwise
[2:09:45] about marble
[2:09:46] and you will believe because you don't
[2:09:49] know
[2:09:51] but the one who knows
[2:09:54] if somebody comes and try to talk about
[2:09:59] he will
[2:10:00] This one doesn't know.
[2:10:08] &gt;&gt; He has moved
[2:10:12] when the lamb stood up
[2:10:15] from his father's throne
[2:10:18] to take the book from the right hand of
[2:10:21] the wife
[2:10:23] who sees on the throne.
[2:10:26] He was no more a lamp.
[2:10:29] He was no more a mediator.
[2:10:32] He was now a lion.
[2:10:38] Where did he took the book from?
[2:10:41] Because they say he took the book from
[2:10:44] his father's throne.
[2:10:47] What was his father's throne?
[2:10:52] Jesus.
[2:10:54] &gt;&gt; Jesus was his father's throne.
[2:10:59] Where did he took the book from?
[2:11:02] He took the book from within himself.
[2:11:07] And the prophet said, he took that book
[2:11:11] and open it and release the seals to
[2:11:15] came down with the book and went to his
[2:11:18] own throne.
[2:11:29] If you don't know this
[2:11:32] &gt;&gt; because these are hidden man.
[2:11:36] Amen. God said to the prophet
[2:11:40] store the food.
[2:11:43] The famine is coming
[2:11:46] but man will arise.
[2:11:50] who will go
[2:11:52] and took those hidden money
[2:11:55] and give them to the church.
[2:12:02] &gt;&gt; All right.
[2:12:06] We are this. We are the bride.
[2:12:12] You must know who you are.
[2:12:17] You must know the time you are living
[2:12:20] in.
[2:12:26] &gt;&gt; If you don't know the time
[2:12:30] you are living in,
[2:12:33] you'll always ask
[2:12:36] what is the time now?
[2:12:40] Because you don't have
[2:12:44] something to show you the time.
[2:12:48] But if you know the time,
[2:12:50] if someone comes, you said now it's
[2:12:53] 8:00,
[2:12:55] you just look at him
[2:13:01] because you know now it's not 8:00.
[2:13:07] But those who don't know the time,
[2:13:10] &gt;&gt; they will go this way. They said, "No,
[2:13:12] it's 8."
[2:13:13] &gt;&gt; No, it's not 8. It's 10. 10.
[2:13:16] &gt;&gt; No, it's not 10.
[2:13:17] &gt;&gt; I say 10
[2:13:20] &gt;&gt; because they don't know
[2:13:22] &gt;&gt; the time they are living
[2:13:26] and they don't know who they are.
[2:13:38] The elder said,
[2:13:42] &gt;&gt; "Our pastors
[2:13:44] have placed us
[2:13:49] &gt;&gt; in the land
[2:13:51] because we crossed over.
[2:13:55] &gt;&gt; And there were there there were people
[2:13:59] who when they were about to cross over,
[2:14:03] they said, "Hey, Joshua,
[2:14:06] hey, we we hear you.
[2:14:09] We love you.
[2:14:11] &gt;&gt; But there is a land
[2:14:14] this side of Jordan.
[2:14:17] &gt;&gt; Could you please
[2:14:20] can you allow us
[2:14:23] just to occupy?
[2:14:27] But don't worry
[2:14:29] when you go to fight that side.
[2:14:32] We will join you.
[2:14:34] But after the fight, we will come back.
[2:14:45] Ah,
[2:14:46] &gt;&gt; don't worry.
[2:14:49] &gt;&gt; You see
[2:14:51] when go Jesus was
[2:14:54] commanding his disciples,
[2:14:58] he said, "Go
[2:15:00] and preach the gospel to every creature.
[2:15:05] He that believeth
[2:15:08] and is baptized
[2:15:10] shall be saved.
[2:15:12] I want to give you a trend,
[2:15:16] &gt;&gt; a trend, a sequence.
[2:15:19] &gt;&gt; He said after baptizing them,
[2:15:23] you must teach them.
[2:15:27] Amen. You preach.
[2:15:30] When they repent,
[2:15:33] you baptize them. After baptism,
[2:15:36] then don't preach.
[2:15:39] &gt;&gt; You teach.
[2:15:45] That is the sequence,
[2:15:48] &gt;&gt; the system,
[2:15:50] &gt;&gt; preach,
[2:15:52] &gt;&gt; baptize,
[2:15:54] &gt;&gt; and teach.
[2:15:59] &gt;&gt; Jesus said,
[2:16:02] &gt;&gt; I'm going to build my church.
[2:16:10] There are churches
[2:16:12] which which were built by men,
[2:16:17] not God.
[2:16:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:16:21] &gt;&gt; I'm not trying to diminish or undermine
[2:16:25] other churches.
[2:16:32] &gt;&gt; It is built
[2:16:35] &gt;&gt; or started by men.
[2:16:40] and he has got the right to say this is
[2:16:42] my church
[2:16:46] my father's church
[2:16:51] IPC
[2:16:53] IPC they are fighting now
[2:16:57] they said that's why I don't want fight
[2:17:00] here
[2:17:05] [applause]
[2:17:06] they are fighting
[2:17:09] Someone said, "You see when the pastor
[2:17:11] pass away
[2:17:15] because I came
[2:17:18] wrong,
[2:17:20] I've seen pastors passed away.
[2:17:26] When the pastor has passed away,
[2:17:30] someone will come."
[2:17:32] When I when I was last with the pastor,
[2:17:38] the pastor said to me, "Follow me." Then
[2:17:42] I followed the pastor.
[2:17:44] I walk in the footstep of the pastor.
[2:17:48] Reuben is is a witness.
[2:17:52] And he said it was meaning
[2:17:57] I'm going to follow him
[2:18:00] when he has passed.
[2:18:03] The other one said, "I was with a pastor
[2:18:07] at De
[2:18:09] and I I paid for him to go there.
[2:18:13] You don't know what he told me when
[2:18:23] it's not what the pastor told you.
[2:18:26] It's what God said.
[2:18:29] It's what church order said.
[2:18:34] That is what we follow.
[2:18:36] We are not following what the pastor has
[2:18:38] said.
[2:18:41] We don't make our pastor an ancestor.
[2:18:47] [applause]
[2:18:50] He said here I leave you with church
[2:18:53] order.
[2:18:56] Now we must follow the church order.
[2:18:59] When our pastor is passed, then we go
[2:19:02] back to church order. What does the
[2:19:04] church order say?
[2:19:07] Let me tell you, there are two groups in
[2:19:09] the church.
[2:19:12] And those two groups, they have got
[2:19:14] their leaders.
[2:19:18] They are taking the church to be a
[2:19:20] political party.
[2:19:26] Each and every leader He's conversing
[2:19:33] and his follower,
[2:19:35] they're conversing for their leader.
[2:19:39] That thing will not work here.
[2:19:46] [cheering]
[2:19:49] [applause]
[2:19:51] We will go back to church order.
[2:19:56] I always thank God
[2:20:00] that we have not chosen the pastor
[2:20:02] first.
[2:20:06] Would have made a mess.
[2:20:16] When we have when we are taking our
[2:20:18] time,
[2:20:20] &gt;&gt; when we are taking our time now,
[2:20:23] we can see the loose ends
[2:20:29] and we fix them
[2:20:33] so that when time comes
[2:20:36] to choose the path, then we will be one.
[2:20:40] Another
[2:20:45] one said after the death of another
[2:20:48] pastor
[2:20:51] he came the pastor said there must be
[2:20:53] the pastor after him
[2:20:59] I'm not some people will say here
[2:21:02] they will say you are talking a lie
[2:21:11] But what they saying they must know who
[2:21:14] they are saying is talking lie.
[2:21:20] That thing will follow them
[2:21:24] until your sin will catch you up.
[2:21:30] [cheering]
[2:21:34] You may no know you might be proud.
[2:21:38] I told him
[2:21:42] you are supporters.
[2:21:46] &gt;&gt; He he told him,
[2:21:48] &gt;&gt; she told him,
[2:21:52] you are pouring fire
[2:21:56] on that the head of that sister or the
[2:21:58] brother.
[2:22:04] Even David
[2:22:07] &gt;&gt; was afraid of Saul.
[2:22:11] &gt;&gt; Even even though Saul was big,
[2:22:16] &gt;&gt; he said this is the anointed of God.
[2:22:22] [applause]
[2:22:24] &gt;&gt; Respect the pulpit.
[2:22:30] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[2:22:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:22:34] &gt;&gt; He said,
[2:22:35] &gt;&gt; "I'm going to build my church."
[2:22:42] God,
[2:22:43] &gt;&gt; not men.
[2:22:45] &gt;&gt; God,
[2:22:47] but God
[2:22:49] will will always use men
[2:22:53] &gt;&gt; to build
[2:22:56] then not men using God.
[2:22:59] But God,
[2:23:01] you see men to build his church.
[2:23:07] When you you will stand up there.
[2:23:10] When God was using me
[2:23:14] to build this church,
[2:23:17] God held me,
[2:23:20] &gt;&gt; not I
[2:23:24] &gt;&gt; because he said I am going to build it.
[2:23:32] &gt;&gt; Not somebody else.
[2:23:35] &gt;&gt; You cannot you cannot boast.
[2:23:40] But he got
[2:23:42] Jesus said, "I'm going to build my
[2:23:45] church."
[2:23:47] And Paul
[2:23:49] &gt;&gt; warned the pastors,
[2:23:52] "Read it, my brother. I think is
[2:23:56] Acts
[2:23:57] 20
[2:24:00] verse 28."
[2:24:01] &gt;&gt; Verse 28. When Paul
[2:24:05] &gt;&gt; was warning the pastors
[2:24:09] about God's church,
[2:24:14] &gt;&gt; read it, my brother.
[2:24:17] &gt;&gt; Take heed therefore unto yourselves
[2:24:21] and to all the flock over the which the
[2:24:24] Holy Ghost have made you overseers.
[2:24:27] &gt;&gt; Who made you overseers?
[2:24:31] The Holy Spirit
[2:24:33] take heat of the flock
[2:24:36] which the Holy Ghost
[2:24:38] has made you over
[2:24:45] to feed the church of God which he have
[2:24:48] purchased with his own blood. Who has
[2:24:50] purchased this church?
[2:24:54] God himself.
[2:24:56] Feed the church of God.
[2:24:59] Not your church.
[2:25:04] Feed the church of God
[2:25:06] which he has purchased
[2:25:09] with his own blood.
[2:25:12] [cheering]
[2:25:14] My pastor said
[2:25:16] I'm pleased.
[2:25:18] I'm now I am fit. I'm fed
[2:25:22] by my own son.
[2:25:27] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[2:25:28] &gt;&gt; because I believe where he is. He He He
[2:25:32] see what I'm doing.
[2:25:35] I think he's saying amen. Amen. Amen.
[2:25:39] &gt;&gt; I knew my son
[2:25:41] would do that.
[2:25:43] He He will never let the church fight.
[2:25:48] [cheering]
[2:25:56] He has purchased
[2:25:58] &gt;&gt; his church
[2:26:00] with his own blood.
[2:26:03] &gt;&gt; He built it himself.
[2:26:06] No one wrote himself
[2:26:10] and no one will stop that church.
[2:26:17] We can't say these things will stop the
[2:26:21] church from the rapture.
[2:26:26] We'll be talking a lie.
[2:26:29] Nothing will stop that church.
[2:26:34] Nothing. Nothing
[2:26:39] because the one who has built it
[2:26:42] is responsible
[2:26:49] to look after that church.
[2:26:52] Don't intimidate people.
[2:26:56] You must do this. If you don't do this,
[2:26:59] then you will.
[2:27:06] It's not about what you are doing is
[2:27:08] about what God has done.
[2:27:11] What planned
[2:27:14] from the beginning. What is happening is
[2:27:18] just on the plan of God.
[2:27:21] And you cannot we can't change that
[2:27:24] plan.
[2:27:26] Even demons cannot change the plan of
[2:27:29] God.
[2:27:32] Let me tell you when Satan tries to to
[2:27:35] disturb the plan of God
[2:27:38] after he has worked
[2:27:41] and he he was sweating.
[2:27:44] When he look back trying to wipe his
[2:27:46] head,
[2:27:48] he found that he was doing the will of
[2:27:51] God.
[2:27:55] Amen.
[2:28:02] &gt;&gt; You cannot do nothing.
[2:28:07] Amen.
[2:28:12] Amen.
[2:28:15] &gt;&gt; I don't know uh yoga technical team I
[2:28:17] want you to put the book the power of
[2:28:20] transform the power of transformation.
[2:28:25] &gt;&gt; Yes that is that.
[2:28:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:28:27] &gt;&gt; It said there
[2:28:29] &gt;&gt; God is going to have a church.
[2:28:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:28:34] &gt;&gt; Let me say today God has a church.
[2:28:38] Amen. The prophet was saying God is
[2:28:42] going to have a church. But today I say
[2:28:45] God has a church.
[2:28:49] He says there I don't care how many dark
[2:28:53] ages
[2:28:55] we go through
[2:28:58] and whatever more
[2:29:00] he is going to have a church
[2:29:04] without spot and drinking
[2:29:07] whether we whether we are part of it
[2:29:11] or not because he has already set in
[2:29:18] It was going to happen.
[2:29:20] &gt;&gt; It's going to be there.
[2:29:23] It is there.
[2:29:30] You see,
[2:29:31] &gt;&gt; you cannot tell the sheep
[2:29:35] sheep.
[2:29:36] &gt;&gt; You must manufacture wool
[2:29:40] because you are a sheep. To show that
[2:29:43] you are a sheep, manufacture wool.
[2:29:47] You are wasting your time.
[2:29:51] &gt;&gt; When the sheep is grass
[2:29:55] and drink water,
[2:30:00] the wool will come out
[2:30:04] and the farmer will take the wool.
[2:30:08] In other words, he's taking what belong
[2:30:10] the right of the sheep.
[2:30:15] And the sheep
[2:30:17] &gt;&gt; cannot complain.
[2:30:22] &gt;&gt; When you see a person complaining
[2:30:26] &gt;&gt; is not the sheep
[2:30:29] [applause]
[2:30:33] is a goat.
[2:30:38] You see, you cannot change a goat to be
[2:30:40] bishop.
[2:30:43] Whatever you do,
[2:30:46] it will go.
[2:30:49] When it looked at the the workers there
[2:30:54] sailing tomatoes,
[2:30:56] it will go there and pick one.
[2:31:00] When they throw it,
[2:31:03] it will jump with a tomato in his mouth.
[2:31:13] because
[2:31:14] &gt;&gt; it is the nature
[2:31:16] &gt;&gt; of a goat.
[2:31:20] &gt;&gt; But sometimes
[2:31:24] a sheep may go with the goats.
[2:31:30] Then because it is used to go with the
[2:31:32] goats,
[2:31:36] it may try to take the the ways of the
[2:31:39] goat.
[2:31:43] But when you take it back,
[2:31:48] you are not a goat.
[2:31:51] You are a sheep.
[2:31:54] When you take it to the right position,
[2:31:58] it will say it will say thank you.
[2:32:01] Now this is this is my position.
[2:32:07] When you take a goat
[2:32:09] You take vote this is your position.
[2:32:14] He will tell others
[2:32:17] they say this is my position.
[2:32:20] It's a lie.
[2:32:22] I think my position
[2:32:32] &gt;&gt; I am not preaching here
[2:32:34] to scorn people.
[2:32:37] &gt;&gt; No no no. Uh-uh.
[2:32:39] &gt;&gt; But I'm bringing mirror
[2:32:46] &gt;&gt; so that you can look inside
[2:32:49] and see if whether
[2:32:52] you are having the characteristics
[2:32:56] of a goat.
[2:32:59] Then you leave that
[2:33:02] because you are not a goat.
[2:33:05] Amen.
[2:33:07] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[2:33:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:33:11] &gt;&gt; You you see things
[2:33:14] &gt;&gt; happen because of the seed inside.
[2:33:20] We can see it from back there.
[2:33:24] God tried
[2:33:26] to warn Cain.
[2:33:33] You see Abel
[2:33:35] if you can pray like Abel
[2:33:39] when he s he says those things
[2:33:42] pain was becoming more angry
[2:33:47] he said my brother is better than me.
[2:33:57] But if it is a child of God, he say
[2:34:02] sorry
[2:34:04] I will take this.
[2:34:11] &gt;&gt; Don't worry church.
[2:34:13] &gt;&gt; I'm here.
[2:34:15] [cheering and applause]
[2:34:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:34:22] &gt;&gt; Let me
[2:34:24] speak in Afghans.
[2:34:28] the Bob dance.
[2:34:53] Those that has fats in their mouth,
[2:34:56] &gt;&gt; they will spew them out. But as such,
[2:35:06] &gt;&gt; the gates of hell will fight
[2:35:10] against it, but they will not prevail
[2:35:15] because it was really sad
[2:35:18] that they will never
[2:35:22] when people try to fight us,
[2:35:26] when people try to fight
[2:35:28] I don't wonder because it is prophesied
[2:35:34] and I know they will never prevail
[2:35:39] [cheering]
[2:35:43] because the church is ordained.
[2:35:48] Paul
[2:35:49] &gt;&gt; calls it
[2:35:52] &gt;&gt; the body
[2:35:54] &gt;&gt; of Christ.
[2:35:57] He says in the book of Colossians
[2:36:00] &gt;&gt; chapter 1 verse 18 I believe
[2:36:01] &gt;&gt; chapter 1 verse 18
[2:36:03] &gt;&gt; he says
[2:36:05] he is the head of his body
[2:36:10] &gt;&gt; the church
[2:36:13] &gt;&gt; he is the church
[2:36:16] he is the head
[2:36:18] &gt;&gt; of his body the church
[2:36:22] &gt;&gt; in other words the church
[2:36:24] &gt;&gt; is his body.
[2:36:27] Amen.
[2:36:28] &gt;&gt; How can the body separate itself from
[2:36:31] the head?
[2:36:35] Because it is already set.
[2:36:38] The church will never be separated with
[2:36:40] the body.
[2:36:46] And the prophet
[2:36:48] &gt;&gt; calls the church
[2:36:51] the family of God.
[2:36:54] But when was when God was building his
[2:36:57] church,
[2:36:59] he built the church from the Gentiles
[2:37:04] because Joseph typed it
[2:37:07] when he married,
[2:37:10] that beautiful Egyptian
[2:37:14] a gentile.
[2:37:17] He was typing that
[2:37:20] &gt;&gt; that Christ
[2:37:22] is going to have his wife
[2:37:26] from the Gentiles.
[2:37:28] &gt;&gt; The prophet says there is a church
[2:37:32] which the roots thereof
[2:37:35] is Jewish
[2:37:38] but the body is gentile.
[2:37:42] Amen. Hallelujah.
[2:37:46] &gt;&gt; That is the church
[2:37:48] &gt;&gt; which God has built.
[2:37:53] &gt;&gt; He says here
[2:37:56] &gt;&gt; when he talks about
[2:37:58] &gt;&gt; he says by is God's provided place of
[2:38:02] worship. I think whether they will
[2:38:07] &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you very much.
[2:38:10] by one spirit. We are all baptized into
[2:38:14] the body
[2:38:16] and that body is a female.
[2:38:21] The body which body Christ
[2:38:25] &gt;&gt; and that body is a family and the family
[2:38:29] of God that is the house of God
[2:38:36] and the house of God is the name of
[2:38:39] Jesus.
[2:38:43] Paul said,
[2:38:45] &gt;&gt; "We must take a wife
[2:38:50] of Christ
[2:38:52] from the Gentiles
[2:38:55] for his name."
[2:38:59] That's why he says that
[2:39:02] the house of God is the name of Jesus
[2:39:06] Christ
[2:39:07] &gt;&gt; and the name of the Lord Jesus
[2:39:11] is a mighty tower.
[2:39:15] If you want to run to the tower,
[2:39:19] where are you going? Where are you
[2:39:20] running to?
[2:39:22] To his church.
[2:39:25] Because that is where his name is. Amen.
[2:39:30] That's right. It's a mighty tower.
[2:39:34] The Russians run into it
[2:39:36] and they are safe.
[2:39:41] Can you go down below that
[2:39:46] &gt;&gt; if you don't know then I will read
[2:39:48] something here.
[2:39:51] All right. If they don't have it, let me
[2:39:53] read something here.
[2:39:56] &gt;&gt; But in a place where I choose to put my
[2:39:59] name. All right. Let me read something
[2:40:01] here. He says, I have choose to put my
[2:40:05] name at the door of my worship.
[2:40:13] For my family will be gathered in there.
[2:40:21] My house, my children, born of my genes.
[2:40:27] Amen. Glory to God. Amen. My genes are
[2:40:31] in them.
[2:40:33] I put my weight in them.
[2:40:37] I write them upon the tables of their
[2:40:40] heart.
[2:40:45] That is my family. The family of the
[2:40:48] book of Jesus Christ,
[2:40:50] &gt;&gt; the family
[2:40:53] and he says here
[2:40:56] &gt;&gt; in this page 237,
[2:40:58] &gt;&gt; more 237.
[2:41:00] &gt;&gt; No, the family of God
[2:41:03] that is that is that. Amen.
[2:41:06] &gt;&gt; He said the family of God
[2:41:08] &gt;&gt; obey
[2:41:10] the order
[2:41:13] of the father of the family.
[2:41:19] When someone said
[2:41:23] that church,
[2:41:27] &gt;&gt; is he one of the family member?
[2:41:31] Because the family of God
[2:41:35] obeys the order of the father of the
[2:41:38] family.
[2:41:43] How can you call me Lord
[2:41:46] &gt;&gt; when you don't listen to my words?
[2:41:52] &gt;&gt; I've chosen pastors.
[2:41:55] I've chosen them
[2:41:58] to be my witness on earth.
[2:42:03] He said here, he said,
[2:42:07] "I'll give you pastors
[2:42:11] who will feed you with knowledge
[2:42:15] &gt;&gt; and understanding
[2:42:24] I will come back here.
[2:42:27] &gt;&gt; Let me stop here.
[2:42:33] &gt;&gt; [applause]
[2:42:39] &gt;&gt; Sunday
[2:42:41] &gt;&gt; I will be with you.
[2:42:45] [applause]
[2:42:51] Amen.

[2:47:48] Can our brother just pray for us after
[2:47:51] the word? Let us pray.
[2:47:54] Thank you, heavenly father.
[2:47:57] Thank you for your word.
[2:48:03] Sometimes it makes us cry.
[2:48:06] Sometimes it makes us happy.
[2:48:10] But that is the word of God.
[2:48:13] &gt;&gt; That is the impact. That is the effect
[2:48:15] of the word of God.
[2:48:18] Indeed, your word is a mirror. Oh God,
[2:48:22] every time when it is preached from the
[2:48:26] heart of God,
[2:48:28] &gt;&gt; it becomes a mirror unto us
[2:48:32] &gt;&gt; and we look unto it and look at
[2:48:36] ourselves in it. where we see there is
[2:48:41] some spots. Oh God, we ask your word to
[2:48:45] please us.
[2:48:48] &gt;&gt; Lord, it is so true
[2:48:51] that this church
[2:48:54] was not
[2:48:56] built by any man.
[2:49:03] It is so true
[2:49:05] that we have got nothing
[2:49:09] to do with it. Oh God.
[2:49:13] &gt;&gt; Honestly,
[2:49:14] we found it here.
[2:49:23] It brings the word that the pastor spoke
[2:49:26] about very true
[2:49:28] &gt;&gt; that you said I will build my church.
[2:49:35] &gt;&gt; Whom are we Lord to try
[2:49:38] and correct it?
[2:49:41] &gt;&gt; Lord we say [music] thank you that
[2:49:43] you've given us pastors.
[2:49:53] It is never ours to correct.
[2:49:57] &gt;&gt; This is your church. Oh God.
[2:50:00] &gt;&gt; We are your body.
[2:50:03] &gt;&gt; We give ourselves as living sacrifice.
[2:50:06] Oh God.
[2:50:08] See if there's anything wrong within us
[2:50:11] &gt;&gt; and remove it. Oh God.
[2:50:18] We commit ourselves unto you.
[2:50:22] &gt;&gt; Sometimes
[2:50:23] we may do other things
[2:50:27] and unaware that they are wrong,
[2:50:30] &gt;&gt; but it's not our intention. Oh God, we
[2:50:34] pray that you have mercy upon every one
[2:50:36] of us and bless us, oh God, like you did
[2:50:39] today. You spoke your word unto us and
[2:50:43] Lord we go home a happy people because
[2:50:47] we have heard your word oh God. This is
[2:50:50] a Christmas message. I will build my
[2:50:54] church. God is building this church.
[2:50:57] Carry on building this church. My God in
[2:51:00] the wonderful name of our Lord and
[2:51:02] Savior. We pray that you bless our dear
[2:51:05] Pastor Makua. Be with him oh God. It is
[2:51:08] not easy to say such things here oh God
[2:51:12] but increase his courage oh God we pray
[2:51:15] for him heavenly father we uplift his
[2:51:18] hands heavenly father may every time
[2:51:20] when he comes and speak may he speak
[2:51:23] boldly
[2:51:26] but sticking to the church order we
[2:51:28] thank you oh God for you've given us the
[2:51:31] church order oh

[2:51:39] You've given us pastor. You've given us
[2:51:42] the church order. Oh,

[2:52:14] Amen. And amen.
[2:52:23] &gt;&gt; Thank you so much, brethren.
[2:52:26] And one more time, we just want to thank
[2:52:28] our pastor
[2:52:34] So as we prepare for the baptism,
[2:52:38] &gt;&gt; let me take

[2:56:11] God bless him.
[2:56:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:56:18] Let us bow our heads in prayer.
[2:56:23] Mighty God, eternal father,
[2:56:26] creator of all things,
[2:56:30] We have gathered Lord Almighty
[2:56:33] at this place.
[2:56:35] Now it's a time for baptism.
[2:56:39] The people that stand here Lord to be
[2:56:41] baptized
[2:56:44] something that has touched their hearts.
[2:56:48] So as they are going to the pool to be
[2:56:52] baptized,
[2:56:54] we commit the whole process unto you,
[2:56:57] Lord.
[2:56:58] May be the one Lord Almighty that will
[2:57:01] be with our brothers that are baptizing
[2:57:05] and also with those that are going to be
[2:57:07] baptized Lord and also all of us Lord
[2:57:11] Almighty who are witnessing that.
[2:57:15] May it be Lord done according to thy
[2:57:17] will.
[2:57:18] We like to thank you father that we
[2:57:21] called the name of our Lord and Savior
[2:57:25] Jesus Christ. Amen. Acts
[2:57:29] [applause]
[2:57:37] chapter 2 from verse 36-39.
[2:57:41] Therefore, let all the house of Israel
[2:57:44] know assuredly that God hath made that
[2:57:46] same Jesus whom he hath crucified, both
[2:57:50] Lord and Christ. Now when they heard
[2:57:52] this, they were pricked in their heart
[2:57:54] and said unto Peter and to the rest of
[2:57:57] the apostles, "Men and brethren, what
[2:58:00] shall we do?" Then Peter said unto them,
[2:58:03] "Repent and be baptized every one of you
[2:58:06] in the name of Jesus Christ for the
[2:58:08] remission of sins, and ye shall receive
