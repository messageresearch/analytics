[44:57] of him.
[45:03] I remember
[45:06] the time. Oh, I remember
[45:12] the place
[45:15] when Jesus
[45:18] so swiftly
[45:20] came in.
[45:25] How he lifted
[45:29] the burden
[45:32] I had carried
[45:34] for so long.
[45:37] And he gave me
[45:40] a vision of him.
[45:45] Don't lose

[1:00:53] begin
[1:00:55] to sound
[1:01:03] our
[1:01:06] should be finished
[1:01:09] as he
[1:01:11] has declared
[1:01:14] to his
[1:01:17] prophets.
[1:01:19] Behold,
[1:01:22] I will set you
[1:01:24] the
[1:01:27] prophet
[1:01:29] before

[1:01:35] and dreadful
[1:01:37] name
[1:01:40] and We shall
[1:01:45] the hearts
[1:01:47] of their fathers
[1:01:49] to their children.
[1:01:52] In the hearts
[1:01:54] of the children
[1:01:57] to the fatherless
[1:02:05] bless
[1:02:20] where
[1:02:26] Holy Ghost,
[1:02:31] Holy Ghost
[1:02:36] with power.
[1:02:48] Holy
[1:02:54] Holy Ghost
[1:03:08] in the wonderful name of our Lord and
[1:03:10] Jesus Christ.
[1:03:14] I'm not sure if I'm audible.
[1:03:25] Can you hear me?
[1:03:40] Welcome. Welcome.
[1:03:55] Holy
[1:03:57] Ghost,
[1:03:59] we welcome
[1:04:15] Holy
[1:04:17] Ghost,
[1:04:19] we welcome
[1:04:22] thee.
[1:04:25] God
[1:04:27] with power
[1:04:29] this very
[1:04:42] we
[1:04:46] amening
[1:04:53] one Am I audible?
[1:04:56] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:04:58] &gt;&gt; It looks like we're good to go.
[1:05:02] &gt;&gt; Let me first start by greeting you in
[1:05:05] the wonderful name of our Lord Jesus.
[1:05:11] It is yet once more another beautiful
[1:05:13] morning
[1:05:16] and we are glad to be in the house of
[1:05:19] the Lord
[1:05:22] because this is the house of correction
[1:05:27] and we are what we are because of this
[1:05:30] house.
[1:05:34] H when correction comes,
[1:05:36] we need to align ourselves.
[1:05:41] Um you know I saw that the highest
[1:05:44] office that you find
[1:05:48] now that is the prophet in the church
[1:05:51] order
[1:05:53] he says is the office of the pastor.
[1:05:58] So it's the highest office with the
[1:05:59] highest correction.
[1:06:03] So um in other words
[1:06:06] um
[1:06:08] if in this day and age
[1:06:12] that we are living in
[1:06:15] we want to be straight with the Lord.
[1:06:22] You know we need to align ourselves
[1:06:26] with the offices that he ordained.
[1:06:30] And then if we do that
[1:06:33] and then I tell you the truth, we will
[1:06:36] grow from strength to strength,
[1:06:39] from power to power.
[1:06:42] Um we will be transformed.
[1:06:46] The power of transformation
[1:06:48] will start to work in us.
[1:06:51] Um
[1:06:53] that was just my greeting.
[1:06:56] So maybe for this morning
[1:07:01] if we got our Bibles
[1:07:04] we can go to
[1:07:06] the book of Genesis
[1:07:10] we read again verse 1 to verse 5
[1:07:18] Genesis 1 verse 1-5
[1:07:21] in the beginning God created the heaven
[1:07:23] and the earth. And the earth was without
[1:07:26] form and void, and darkness was upon the
[1:07:30] face of the deep. And the spirit of God
[1:07:33] moved upon the face of the waters. And
[1:07:36] God said, "Let there be light, and there
[1:07:39] was light." And God saw the light that
[1:07:42] it was good. And God divided the light
[1:07:45] from the darkness. And God called the
[1:07:48] light day, and the darkness he called
[1:07:50] night. And the evening and the morning
[1:07:53] were the first day.
[1:07:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:07:56] &gt;&gt; Can you say a word of prayer for us?
[1:08:24] Yes.
[1:08:42] Amen.
[1:08:47] Yes.
[1:09:06] Amen. Amen. God bless you.
[1:09:16] So um my subject uh this morning
[1:09:23] is just to continue with the message
[1:09:26] that we had the last time I was here.
[1:09:33] You recall that we were talking about
[1:09:35] children of the light
[1:09:40] and that's I just want us to follow that
[1:09:43] train
[1:09:47] and it's because you know I was trying
[1:09:49] to look elsewhere
[1:09:53] but something said to me you haven't
[1:09:55] finished
[1:09:58] and so um I thought maybe let me come
[1:10:02] back again
[1:10:05] because you know when you talk about
[1:10:07] light
[1:10:09] you're talking about something that
[1:10:13] has creative power like we said
[1:10:21] because that is the first thing that God
[1:10:24] created
[1:10:28] and um when you follow uh this light,
[1:10:34] &gt;&gt; the supernatural one. Now,
[1:10:38] you realize that
[1:10:41] it's the alpha and the omega.
[1:10:46] You'll realize that the whole Bible
[1:10:50] is centered around that
[1:10:55] without light
[1:10:58] nothing could happen.
[1:11:01] Now maybe quickly let us uh try and
[1:11:05] recap a little bit
[1:11:12] just to refresh our memory
[1:11:16] uh before we jump into the thought.
[1:11:20] Um and in doing that we read from verse
[1:11:25] one to verse 5
[1:11:28] but also let's read verse I think it's
[1:11:31] 14
[1:11:36] verse 14 it says and God said let there
[1:11:40] be lights in the firmament of the heaven
[1:11:43] to divide the day from the night and let
[1:11:46] them be for signs and for seasons and
[1:11:50] for days and years.
[1:11:52] &gt;&gt; All right. Um so we've tried to show
[1:11:54] that there's the there's two lights that
[1:11:56] we have
[1:12:00] um is the supernatural light
[1:12:04] which we found in verse three
[1:12:08] because it says God said
[1:12:10] let there be light and there was light.
[1:12:14] But in 14
[1:12:17] talks again that God said let there be
[1:12:22] lights.
[1:12:24] So here it's it's plural
[1:12:28] but where we started it's right.
[1:12:32] So the one is supernatural
[1:12:35] one is natural.
[1:12:39] When you come to the supernatural
[1:12:43] it's one thing.
[1:12:45] But when we come to the natural,
[1:12:47] we find that it's light.
[1:12:51] &gt;&gt; Now, um putting back in perspective,
[1:12:56] maybe we can just show quickly that
[1:12:59] diagram where we were showing the solar
[1:13:03] system
[1:13:07] because
[1:13:10] you recall that we read last time
[1:13:15] in the spoken word
[1:13:16] &gt;&gt; spoken word
[1:13:19] and that spoken word is the cruelty of
[1:13:21] sin
[1:13:26] how God
[1:13:29] &gt;&gt; when he was creating
[1:13:33] um he he he spoke
[1:13:39] like I'm starting here in 14
[1:13:43] He says, "Let there be lights
[1:13:46] in the firm in the firmament of the
[1:13:48] heaven to divide the day from the
[1:13:51] night."
[1:13:55] Um
[1:13:57] so the prophet
[1:13:59] took us to a trip
[1:14:02] and in this trip
[1:14:05] he says to us
[1:14:07] God
[1:14:09] when he started
[1:14:13] to say let there be lights
[1:14:16] &gt;&gt; the greatest light that there was
[1:14:20] it was the sun.
[1:14:22] And he says all these other ones,
[1:14:26] all these other planets,
[1:14:32] they actually sprung from the sun,
[1:14:38] you know, he he he the prophet alludes
[1:14:40] that
[1:14:44] this theory of the big bang
[1:14:49] is not far from the truth.
[1:14:51] So he says go God spoke
[1:14:55] &gt;&gt; and then a missile went out
[1:14:57] &gt;&gt; and then
[1:14:59] he calls it the linker went out.
[1:15:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:15:02] So that missile that went out,
[1:15:05] &gt;&gt; it's part of
[1:15:07] the sun,
[1:15:10] but it came from the sun
[1:15:13] and then it went out
[1:15:16] &gt;&gt; and then when it reached a point
[1:15:17] somewhere.
[1:15:20] You know the prophet says
[1:15:23] this thing happened millions of years.
[1:15:28] He says when it reached somewhere
[1:15:30] he said stop and then another missile
[1:15:34] went out
[1:15:35] and when it reached somewhere and then
[1:15:38] he said stop
[1:15:40] &gt;&gt; and that's how they stopped
[1:15:43] and they're all hanging in space
[1:15:51] now he says to us
[1:15:55] God is so past.
[1:15:58] Even today when they study this
[1:16:01] universe.
[1:16:04] So that which you are seeing now
[1:16:07] it is just the basic.
[1:16:10] There are other planets that they
[1:16:11] discovering
[1:16:15] that are not listed here
[1:16:18] just to show how vast God is.
[1:16:22] There are other stars that are coming up
[1:16:29] because men is discovering
[1:16:34] through science
[1:16:36] and through the tools that they have.
[1:16:40] They discover other planets.
[1:16:44] So if you follow them,
[1:16:48] I don't know where you will end
[1:16:51] because this thing it just continues,
[1:16:56] just explodes.
[1:17:00] Now I want us to pick up something here.
[1:17:06] If you look
[1:17:08] where the earth is placed,
[1:17:11] um, if you can just it again that
[1:17:15] You will notice if you count from the
[1:17:17] sun
[1:17:19] you find Mercury,
[1:17:21] &gt;&gt; you find Venus Venus
[1:17:23] &gt;&gt; and then you find Earth.
[1:17:25] &gt;&gt; So if you count the planets
[1:17:29] from the sun
[1:17:33] because now everything comes from the
[1:17:35] sun.
[1:17:37] So the first one that came
[1:17:41] &gt;&gt; which is Mercury Mercury
[1:17:44] &gt;&gt; it's the first
[1:17:46] and then we've got Venus which is the
[1:17:48] second.
[1:17:49] &gt;&gt; Now Earth was placed on the third
[1:17:55] because it had to be placed in a perfect
[1:17:59] spot.
[1:18:03] Three is a is a number of perfection.
[1:18:07] That is why God placed it there. Now
[1:18:10] when the scientists came,
[1:18:13] they tried to look
[1:18:15] that because they they see in earth
[1:18:19] it is the only planet
[1:18:23] that has got life in it.
[1:18:27] It's got botan life. It's got human
[1:18:29] life. It's got water. It's got it is the
[1:18:34] only planet
[1:18:35] &gt;&gt; that's got the environment
[1:18:39] &gt;&gt; that support living.
[1:18:43] &gt;&gt; Now even today they're still trying to
[1:18:46] probe
[1:18:49] which other planet
[1:18:52] that we can explore
[1:18:54] and then maybe
[1:18:57] man can survive there.
[1:19:00] But even today,
[1:19:01] &gt;&gt; they haven't found water.
[1:19:07] Earth
[1:19:09] God prepared it
[1:19:11] specially
[1:19:14] for us to continue
[1:19:17] with the battle that started in heaven.
[1:19:22] So we are here not to relax.
[1:19:27] If you can find yourself relaxed,
[1:19:30] you must know something is wrong.
[1:19:33] But if you find yourself on your toes
[1:19:37] every minute every hour, then you know
[1:19:42] I'm in the right place
[1:19:49] somewhere is trying to prove
[1:19:53] like he did with Job
[1:19:56] that go and test that one
[1:19:59] and see what he will do.
[1:20:06] So that is why you find there's children
[1:20:07] of the light
[1:20:10] and the children of darkness.
[1:20:12] Are we together?
[1:20:15] &gt;&gt; That's how these things move together.
[1:20:21] Now
[1:20:22] again
[1:20:24] &gt;&gt; you will see that
[1:20:28] there is something
[1:20:31] special
[1:20:35] that God
[1:20:37] made about earth
[1:20:43] and that special
[1:20:50] It is because
[1:20:52] God is an object of worship.
[1:20:58] &gt;&gt; So before he was God,
[1:21:02] it means there was no one to worship
[1:21:04] him.
[1:21:08] But for him to be God,
[1:21:10] he had to create an environment
[1:21:14] where now he's going to be worshiped
[1:21:18] as the almighty God.
[1:21:21] And he knew that those that are going to
[1:21:24] worship me,
[1:21:27] I'm going to give them part of myself.
[1:21:32] So they are not going to worship me
[1:21:35] from their own triings.
[1:21:39] They're going to worship me from the
[1:21:42] light
[1:21:44] that I had imparted.
[1:21:48] Right?
[1:21:50] &gt;&gt; So remember
[1:21:52] each one of the planet.
[1:21:55] &gt;&gt; Okay, let me explain something just to
[1:21:57] recap quickly and then I get to my
[1:22:00] as part of my recap. Amen.
[1:22:02] &gt;&gt; Remember that
[1:22:04] &gt;&gt; we had said
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; um the earth
[1:22:10] &gt;&gt; that we live in
[1:22:14] &gt;&gt; um it's doing two things
[1:22:19] and one
[1:22:21] it's called rotation
[1:22:25] and another one it's called revolution.
[1:22:32] So it revolves. Okay. Yeah, I think
[1:22:34] there it is.
[1:22:36] &gt;&gt; So the first one is rotation.
[1:22:40] &gt;&gt; So rotation
[1:22:42] if I demonstrate it so that we are
[1:22:44] together.
[1:22:46] It means it does this
[1:22:52] where it is.
[1:22:54] It does that. That is rotation.
[1:22:58] That is the earth. And that we have read
[1:23:01] it in 14.
[1:23:03] &gt;&gt; Let me read again.
[1:23:05] And God said let there be lights
[1:23:08] in the firmament of the heaven
[1:23:12] to divide the day from the night.
[1:23:16] So to divide the day from the night
[1:23:20] revolves
[1:23:23] rotate. Sorry rotate.
[1:23:26] &gt;&gt; Yeah. like this
[1:23:29] where it is it's rotating
[1:23:33] there's another movement.
[1:23:36] So the rotation
[1:23:39] takes 24 hours
[1:23:44] 12 day
[1:23:46] 12 night
[1:23:48] that's rotation.
[1:23:51] &gt;&gt; That is why in this earth
[1:23:54] when we are here it's morning but
[1:23:57] somewhere else it's night
[1:24:01] because it depends your position to the
[1:24:03] sun.
[1:24:09] Are we together?
[1:24:11] &gt;&gt; Then there's another one
[1:24:14] &gt;&gt; that move
[1:24:17] it is revolution.
[1:24:20] &gt;&gt; This is the one.
[1:24:23] So revolution
[1:24:25] takes about 365 years.
[1:24:28] 365
[1:24:29] &gt;&gt; give or take
[1:24:31] that is according to science.
[1:24:34] Uh but the prophet will come and says
[1:24:38] this calendar is wrong
[1:24:41] 30
[1:24:44] and we get to what? 360 I think
[1:24:48] &gt;&gt; give or take. Amen.
[1:24:50] &gt;&gt; Who do you take?
[1:24:53] &gt;&gt; I take the prophet.
[1:24:56] Now the the revolution
[1:25:00] brings
[1:25:03] and this is verse 14.
[1:25:05] &gt;&gt; It says, "And let them be for signs
[1:25:09] &gt;&gt; and for the seasons
[1:25:11] &gt;&gt; and for the days and for years." Amen.
[1:25:15] &gt;&gt; So the revolution
[1:25:17] revolution
[1:25:19] it brings as I have right here
[1:25:23] the seasons. That is why we have winter
[1:25:28] here. Now
[1:25:30] we are in summer.
[1:25:34] &gt;&gt; Right. But where is
[1:25:39] he told me it's winter?
[1:25:43] Are we together?
[1:25:44] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now
[1:25:46] all these things
[1:25:48] depend
[1:25:51] how you are positioned
[1:25:54] to the sun.
[1:25:57] So we get seasons
[1:26:01] because
[1:26:03] it depends where are we positioned to
[1:26:06] the sun.
[1:26:08] And it also says he put signs
[1:26:15] this thing that he did it's for signs.
[1:26:21] That is why we've also mentioned that
[1:26:24] the first the first Bible
[1:26:27] was in the
[1:26:30] zodiac.
[1:26:31] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Because there you'll get the sign,
[1:26:35] you'll get the times.
[1:26:37] Today you are spoiled
[1:26:40] because we've got the clock. But if you
[1:26:43] can visit the olden people,
[1:26:45] they used to look for time.
[1:26:49] They used to look the sky
[1:26:52] whether it's day or night.
[1:26:56] Maybe me I can try during the day
[1:27:00] because I know where the sun sets. I
[1:27:01] mean it rises
[1:27:04] and I know when it's midday
[1:27:07] and I know when it's setting
[1:27:09] but in the night I've got a challenge.
[1:27:14] But the olden people they used to go out
[1:27:18] they will tell you about the north star.
[1:27:23] They will tell you a lot of things about
[1:27:26] the signs that are there.
[1:27:28] That is why the wise men from the east,
[1:27:32] they saw a sign and they knew that a
[1:27:35] king is born. They knew that God cannot
[1:27:38] lie.
[1:27:40] That is the writing of God.
[1:27:43] If you see the sign there,
[1:27:46] that sign is perfect.
[1:27:48] What's happening there? It's happening
[1:27:51] here.
[1:27:55] He made the bigger light to to rule in
[1:27:58] the day
[1:28:02] and the lesser light
[1:28:04] to to rule during the night.
[1:28:09] You know distinct type,
[1:28:12] there's a lesser, there's a greater
[1:28:15] life. Both have ruling power.
[1:28:22] If you look
[1:28:25] around
[1:28:27] during the day,
[1:28:30] okay, there are works of the night,
[1:28:34] there are works of the day.
[1:28:37] You know, when people do the works of
[1:28:38] the day,
[1:28:40] you can see that these are the works of
[1:28:41] the day
[1:28:44] because there's a there's a greater
[1:28:45] light.
[1:28:48] Are we together?
[1:28:48] &gt;&gt; Amen. You can see the greater light
[1:28:54] allows you to do the works of the day.
[1:28:58] But there are people who are waiting
[1:29:00] for the lesser light
[1:29:03] because during the day they can't
[1:29:05] operate.
[1:29:08] They wait for the lesser light
[1:29:11] and then during that light they know
[1:29:13] that now this is our time.
[1:29:19] They have works
[1:29:20] &gt;&gt; of the devil.
[1:29:27] Um,
[1:29:29] I once
[1:29:31] said something
[1:29:35] that you know
[1:29:38] in the house
[1:29:42] if you are troubled
[1:29:45] by this there's some this um crawling
[1:29:49] insects
[1:29:54] They call them maf.
[1:29:56] &gt;&gt; They call them cockroaches.
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; So you'll recall that
[1:30:07] they are very effective when there's no
[1:30:09] light.
[1:30:13] So if you come in the night
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; and it's off, it slides off
[1:30:23] &gt;&gt; and there's a problem in the house.
[1:30:25] If you say
[1:30:29] and you will see children of darkness
[1:30:33] taking cover
[1:30:36] they just show you
[1:30:39] they operate better
[1:30:42] they strive better
[1:30:44] when it's dark
[1:30:46] but there are other people
[1:30:49] that you will see they blossoming better
[1:30:54] when it's day because they are children
[1:30:57] of the day,
[1:30:59] not of the night.
[1:31:02] They are part of the light,
[1:31:06] that light lives in them.
[1:31:09] And that light keeps them in check,
[1:31:14] even if you gossip about them,
[1:31:18] they just looking in themselves.
[1:31:22] Is anything wrong with me?
[1:31:24] If they still find the light is still
[1:31:26] there,
[1:31:27] they cannot be bothered
[1:31:33] because they have to walk the talk
[1:31:38] and the talk is the Bible.
[1:31:42] This is the great light
[1:31:45] that man ever saw
[1:31:48] that started there,
[1:31:50] &gt;&gt; came into the pyramid
[1:31:52] and came here. Amen.
[1:31:53] &gt;&gt; It's a light.
[1:31:56] &gt;&gt; The word.
[1:31:58] &gt;&gt; Now, in the beginning,
[1:32:00] &gt;&gt; God created the heaven and the earth.
[1:32:04] Let me not go there.
[1:32:07] &gt;&gt; I was just trying to recap
[1:32:12] just to show you.
[1:32:14] Um when we talk about the children of
[1:32:17] the light,
[1:32:19] how did the whole thing start
[1:32:23] and starting it
[1:32:25] before the foundation of the world?
[1:32:29] &gt;&gt; Now this thing of the this thing has
[1:32:32] always been troubling me.
[1:32:35] Um you know about before the foundation
[1:32:40] of the world
[1:32:44] In this sense,
[1:32:48] maybe let me put it correctly,
[1:32:52] it made me curious
[1:32:57] more about it
[1:33:03] because it it indicates
[1:33:07] that there was a civilization
[1:33:11] before before this civilization.
[1:33:16] Yeah.
[1:33:18] Yes. So before this civilization
[1:33:21] there was another civilization
[1:33:26] because
[1:33:28] that civilization
[1:33:31] is the one that
[1:33:34] God
[1:33:37] &gt;&gt; you know Job was tried
[1:33:42] and actually job it's just um the devil.
[1:33:46] Amen. um that went to God
[1:33:54] um
[1:33:57] or God
[1:33:59] knew that
[1:34:01] &gt;&gt; Job Job is part of the light
[1:34:05] and him being part of the light
[1:34:09] because remember I said there's
[1:34:10] something special that God did
[1:34:14] about the earth
[1:34:16] and that special thing
[1:34:19] is that there is something that's come
[1:34:21] from another civilization
[1:34:25] that dropped into this civilization.
[1:34:29] &gt;&gt; Are you with me?
[1:34:32] &gt;&gt; Let me repeat myself a little bit.
[1:34:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:34] &gt;&gt; There is something
[1:34:36] in this civilization
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; that comes from another civilization.
[1:34:44] And when it's here in this civilization,
[1:34:51] let's read Job then we combine it.
[1:34:55] &gt;&gt; Um so that I can get to to the other
[1:34:58] things here.
[1:34:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:00] &gt;&gt; Job 38 again.
[1:35:02] &gt;&gt; Job 38.
[1:35:07] &gt;&gt; It says, "Then the Lord answered Job out
[1:35:10] of a whirlwind and said,
[1:35:17] Who is this that can counel by words
[1:35:20] without knowledge?
[1:35:24] Amen.
[1:35:43] Yeah. Get up now, th like a man,
[1:35:48] &gt;&gt; for I will demand of thee
[1:35:51] an answer thou me.
[1:35:57] &gt;&gt; Okay, let me try and maybe elaborate
[1:36:00] something here.
[1:36:03] &gt;&gt; The prophet says,
[1:36:08] Job job
[1:36:12] came to a point
[1:36:16] where
[1:36:19] because remember a
[1:36:22] he was a blessed man.
[1:36:26] &gt;&gt; He was a man
[1:36:30] that didn't do any evil.
[1:36:34] He was living upright.
[1:36:39] But the prophet somewhere says
[1:36:44] you know he somewhere Job had he was
[1:36:48] proud
[1:36:53] and that is why God came to him now
[1:36:56] and said to him get up your lines
[1:37:01] I want to talk to you now and answer me
[1:37:04] if you
[1:37:07] And this is what made me very curious
[1:37:12] because you know as I was reading it
[1:37:16] I could realize that
[1:37:20] God
[1:37:23] has people
[1:37:26] that were with him
[1:37:28] before the foundation of the world.
[1:37:32] That that's why he asked Job this
[1:37:33] question.
[1:37:35] Where was thou when I laid the
[1:37:36] foundation of
[1:37:40] if thou has understanding?
[1:37:45] Who had laid the measure thereof?
[1:37:50] If thou knowest,
[1:37:52] or who had stretched the line upon it,
[1:37:59] whereupon are the foundations thereof
[1:38:02] fastened,
[1:38:05] or who laid the cornerstone thereof.
[1:38:13] When the morning stars sang together
[1:38:20] and all the sons of God shouted for joy,
[1:38:27] it was question after question after
[1:38:29] question
[1:38:31] to Job. Job God asking him where were
[1:38:35] you
[1:38:37] &gt;&gt; and answer me if you have understanding.
[1:38:42] &gt;&gt; Now this is what I want to send
[1:38:49] God
[1:38:53] needed an answer
[1:38:57] while he had an answer.
[1:39:01] He wanted to show
[1:39:04] job that job
[1:39:06] I'm in charge here.
[1:39:13] Um, you must know your your space
[1:39:19] and and I know my space.
[1:39:24] Then I started to be curious around this
[1:39:27] address, you know.
[1:39:30] Then when I looked upon when I looked
[1:39:31] closer
[1:39:34] I saw that
[1:39:36] actually the whole thing that God is
[1:39:39] asking
[1:39:42] it's plain in the creation.
[1:39:47] If you follow the creation
[1:39:50] you will see that
[1:39:52] it's a plain thing.
[1:39:55] Now um the prophet explains it like
[1:39:59] this.
[1:40:01] He says or let me say he interprets it
[1:40:04] like this.
[1:40:06] He says
[1:40:10] before the foundation
[1:40:13] when we in interpreting it
[1:40:18] is before the world was formed.
[1:40:25] Because in my mind
[1:40:27] I was already looking for
[1:40:33] some
[1:40:34] foundation
[1:40:37] because I've got I've got an idea that
[1:40:39] the house
[1:40:42] when you build it you must have you must
[1:40:46] dig
[1:40:48] &gt;&gt; and that's the foundation.
[1:40:51] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:40:51] &gt;&gt; Amen. you dig
[1:40:54] that is the foundation.
[1:40:56] Now I I'm wondering
[1:40:58] because when I look at the earth
[1:41:01] &gt;&gt; and the planets
[1:41:04] &gt;&gt; I see them they in space.
[1:41:09] &gt;&gt; But the prophet has answered us
[1:41:12] because it says
[1:41:15] he spoke something shot out
[1:41:19] &gt;&gt; and he said stop. Amen.
[1:41:24] &gt;&gt; So you know what's holding everything
[1:41:27] &gt;&gt; is the word.
[1:41:30] &gt;&gt; The foundation
[1:41:32] &gt;&gt; is the word.
[1:41:37] &gt;&gt; You don't have to look for shovels and
[1:41:39] other things.
[1:41:42] &gt;&gt; No,
[1:41:43] he said stop
[1:41:46] and it stopped. Now naturally speaking
[1:41:50] all these planets
[1:41:53] are held by a magnetic power
[1:41:58] that's coming from the sun.
[1:42:01] The sun has got so much energy
[1:42:05] that it's holding them.
[1:42:10] The prophet says if one planet was not
[1:42:13] was out of its cater
[1:42:19] was going to go directly to the sun
[1:42:23] and explode.
[1:42:25] But the magnetic power
[1:42:30] all these things are coming from the
[1:42:31] sun.
[1:42:33] So there's a magnetic power between the
[1:42:36] sun and the planets.
[1:42:40] The sun rules over all of them
[1:42:44] and it's got power to keep them in their
[1:42:48] position.
[1:42:50] That is why somewhere here it talks
[1:42:52] about the line.
[1:42:54] It's part of the foundation.
[1:42:57] Some it talks of a line
[1:43:02] because yeah in verse five verse five
[1:43:05] &gt;&gt; he says who had laid the measure thereof
[1:43:10] if thou knowest or who had stretched the
[1:43:14] line upon it.
[1:43:17] So each planet
[1:43:19] has got a line has got a track where
[1:43:23] it's moving.
[1:43:25] Are we together?
[1:43:27] that check
[1:43:29] &gt;&gt; it's a foundation
[1:43:31] &gt;&gt; because a foundation
[1:43:34] &gt;&gt; it's a position
[1:43:37] that's where you are placed
[1:43:40] where you are placed you are given a
[1:43:42] track
[1:43:44] that your tech is this one now if you
[1:43:48] look at those texts
[1:43:50] Mercury
[1:43:51] &gt;&gt; has got the shortest track
[1:43:55] maybe let me try and explain in it.
[1:43:58] When you go to those that run,
[1:44:02] you go to the stadium when they place
[1:44:04] them on their tracks,
[1:44:08] they don't place them straight like
[1:44:09] this.
[1:44:11] I'm talking about the relay runners
[1:44:13] or the sprinters.
[1:44:15] Are we together? They don't put them in
[1:44:18] one line.
[1:44:20] It's because they are tracks.
[1:44:23] The first track got the shortest
[1:44:26] distance.
[1:44:29] The last track
[1:44:31] has got the fairest distance.
[1:44:35] &gt;&gt; That is why the first man will be right
[1:44:39] behind
[1:44:41] and and and the one on the last track
[1:44:46] will be ahead.
[1:44:47] When you look at it, you'll say it's
[1:44:49] unfair.
[1:44:52] But they have made the measurements
[1:44:56] and according to the measurements
[1:44:59] if they run from here and one starting
[1:45:01] from here when they end where they
[1:45:06] finish
[1:45:07] it's going to be the same distance
[1:45:12] but God gave different tracks
[1:45:16] and then if you cross your trackified
[1:45:20] disqualify
[1:45:22] number one.
[1:45:23] &gt;&gt; Even if you are number one, you must
[1:45:24] keep your track.
[1:45:29] Amen.
[1:45:31] &gt;&gt; So in disqualification is is sad.
[1:45:37] because they let you run
[1:45:39] the course,
[1:45:41] but when you get to the finish line,
[1:45:44] they pull out the red card
[1:45:49] right at the finishing.
[1:45:52] So, you better be careful.
[1:45:56] Whose line are you looking at?
[1:46:05] The light
[1:46:07] &gt;&gt; gave them their position.
[1:46:10] &gt;&gt; Mercury Mercury
[1:46:12] &gt;&gt; has got the shortest distance.
[1:46:15] So it means when the earth takes 365
[1:46:19] &gt;&gt; Mercury takes short.
[1:46:21] I didn't calculate it. I don't know how
[1:46:23] long, but I'm just demonstrating to you
[1:46:27] that the distance of these things
[1:46:31] is not the same.
[1:46:33] Others take longer
[1:46:36] to finish the same distance
[1:46:38] because their track
[1:46:42] is long.
[1:46:45] Others closer to the sun,
[1:46:48] they overtake even others.
[1:46:54] As people we are not the same and equal
[1:46:59] with another person gauge with what God
[1:47:03] has given in you
[1:47:07] that God which has given you
[1:47:10] will make you to run the pace.
[1:47:14] You'll speak like Paul.
[1:47:16] I have run the race. I have finished the
[1:47:19] course.
[1:47:20] I'm only waiting.
[1:47:28] &gt;&gt; I'm waiting for the cap.
[1:47:31] &gt;&gt; Because potentially I'm a graduate
[1:47:36] graduate.
[1:47:37] Are we together? Amen.
[1:47:41] That's the the snapshot
[1:47:44] of or the recap
[1:47:47] of what we were trying to say last.
[1:47:50] Amen.
[1:47:51] &gt;&gt; But now let me come to now.
[1:47:55] You must know that
[1:47:58] we are also orbiting around the sun
[1:48:04] and we not not not the sun.
[1:48:08] We obbit around the s.
[1:48:15] &gt;&gt; He gives us, he gave us our tracks, our
[1:48:18] life
[1:48:22] &gt;&gt; and he gave us before
[1:48:24] &gt;&gt; the foundation
[1:48:27] before the foundation of this world.
[1:48:30] So this means
[1:48:32] before this world was
[1:48:35] you were
[1:48:38] the things that you see they're not new
[1:48:46] and if they're not new.
[1:48:48] You see somebody that not seeing things
[1:48:50] for the first time
[1:48:53] is matured.
[1:48:56] You know if you take yourself
[1:48:59] and you reverse your life
[1:49:03] but having the knowledge that you have
[1:49:04] now
[1:49:07] I promise you there are a lot of things
[1:49:11] that when you were young
[1:49:13] you would have done different
[1:49:16] your mother was trying to tell you
[1:49:19] don't take this root
[1:49:22] and you only
[1:49:30] Yeah.
[1:49:32] So,
[1:49:35] the other one is saying
[1:49:36] &gt;&gt; I was not there when they were young.
[1:49:40] Now they want to disturb me.
[1:49:43] But when you come to that spot
[1:49:46] and you reverse, then you remember your
[1:49:49] mother.
[1:49:50] Hey, my mother told me this. Hey, my
[1:49:53] father told me, "Look where I am now.
[1:49:57] Pastor told me this thing."
[1:50:01] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:50:06] &gt;&gt; If if you didn't start here,
[1:50:09] &gt;&gt; you're not confused by you by youth.
[1:50:16] in the sense that peer pressure
[1:50:21] holds you.
[1:50:23] Amen. There's a certain light
[1:50:27] that makes you to act different
[1:50:30] and that make you to understand
[1:50:33] even in your workplace.
[1:50:35] They know that there are certain things
[1:50:38] that this one will never do.
[1:50:44] Why is because these things are not new.
[1:50:50] You saw them before
[1:50:53] and you you opted to take the light
[1:50:57] or the light opted to take you.
[1:51:01] Let's put it better. The light opted to
[1:51:04] take you.
[1:51:08] And it transformed you
[1:51:10] to something different
[1:51:14] to something beautiful
[1:51:16] to something
[1:51:18] that you yourself
[1:51:20] when you look back you have no regrets.
[1:51:24] You know you say since I repented
[1:51:29] I don't I have no regrets
[1:51:36] &gt;&gt; then you know
[1:51:39] &gt;&gt; I have arrived
[1:51:42] &gt;&gt; then you don't change
[1:51:44] &gt;&gt; amen
[1:51:44] &gt;&gt; okay it is we are children of the light
[1:51:49] &gt;&gt; who are following the light
[1:51:51] &gt;&gt; this light that we follow.
[1:51:54] It's our
[1:51:57] it's our it's our guide.
[1:52:00] Let me let me go now to this
[1:52:05] what I want us to look at the angle
[1:52:09] today.
[1:52:12] The other one was just recapping from
[1:52:15] last
[1:52:17] but let's let's let's pick up
[1:52:22] John
[1:52:22] &gt;&gt; John chapter one
[1:52:26] and here
[1:52:29] &gt;&gt; in the book of John
[1:52:31] &gt;&gt; let's read from verse one to verse 9.
[1:52:42] In the beginning was the word and the
[1:52:44] word was with God and the word was God.
[1:52:47] The same was in the beginning with God.
[1:52:50] All things were made by him and without
[1:52:53] him was nothing was not anything made
[1:52:56] that was made. In him was life and the
[1:53:00] life was the light of the light shineth
[1:53:04] in darkness and the darkness
[1:53:06] comprehended it not. There was a man
[1:53:09] sent from God whose name was John. The
[1:53:13] same came for a witness, to bear witness
[1:53:16] of the light, that all men through him
[1:53:19] might believe. He was not that light,
[1:53:22] but was sent to bear witness of that
[1:53:25] light. That was the true light, which
[1:53:28] lightenth every man that cometh into the
[1:53:31] world.
[1:53:33] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:53:36] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Um, so I'm picking up John.
[1:53:42] Um because this is also another
[1:53:45] beginning.
[1:53:48] &gt;&gt; Because it says in the beginning was the
[1:53:50] way
[1:53:52] and the word was God
[1:53:54] and the word was with God.
[1:53:57] And then in in Genesis one
[1:54:00] verse one
[1:54:02] that one says
[1:54:05] in the beginning God created
[1:54:08] the heaven and the earth. Are we
[1:54:10] together?
[1:54:13] &gt;&gt; That was the beginning of creation.
[1:54:17] &gt;&gt; Now here John
[1:54:20] picks up another beginning.
[1:54:23] God has no beginning. God has no ending.
[1:54:27] But God
[1:54:29] take a certain form
[1:54:33] in order for us, in order for human to
[1:54:37] have an idea
[1:54:39] who is God.
[1:54:41] God is a spirit.
[1:54:43] But being a spirit, he made man. Now he
[1:54:47] loves this man. Now he wants this man to
[1:54:51] have an idea of who God is.
[1:54:57] Now
[1:54:59] that is why John says
[1:55:01] in verse one,
[1:55:03] in the beginning was the word.
[1:55:07] The word it's a spiritual thing.
[1:55:11] Are we together?
[1:55:14] That is why Jesus once said,
[1:55:18] "The words that I speak to you,
[1:55:21] they are spirit
[1:55:23] and they are alive.
[1:55:25] Are we together?"
[1:55:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:55:27] So now this beginning it's actually the
[1:55:32] unfolding
[1:55:34] of God because God
[1:55:38] wants
[1:55:40] he wants us.
[1:55:43] He he condescend he's condescending
[1:55:47] to something
[1:55:50] that is tangible.
[1:55:53] Amen.
[1:55:54] &gt;&gt; That is why in first John
[1:55:58] we read that that which was from there
[1:56:04] &gt;&gt; which we have handled which we have seen
[1:56:07] &gt;&gt; are we together.
[1:56:11] So if you take all these things
[1:56:14] you'll realize that
[1:56:16] &gt;&gt; God
[1:56:18] um
[1:56:20] came to be a man.
[1:56:23] Amen.
[1:56:26] &gt;&gt; So that men
[1:56:28] &gt;&gt; can understand
[1:56:30] &gt;&gt; that he also
[1:56:32] &gt;&gt; is a small god.
[1:56:37] &gt;&gt; So that men can realize and appreciate
[1:56:39] that.
[1:56:42] I am a god.
[1:56:48] If you can come to that stage
[1:56:51] then then you are a child of light.
[1:56:56] &gt;&gt; Okay. It says here
[1:56:58] &gt;&gt; two
[1:56:59] &gt;&gt; the same was in the beginning with God.
[1:57:04] I'll come back and explain this verse.
[1:57:08] Two.
[1:57:09] &gt;&gt; Let me
[1:57:11] read three. It says all things were made
[1:57:14] by him.
[1:57:16] And without him
[1:57:20] was not anything made that was made.
[1:57:24] Now if you listen carefully you will
[1:57:26] realize that now the weight start to
[1:57:29] become him
[1:57:31] in the beginning was the weight was God
[1:57:36] the same
[1:57:38] was God.
[1:57:40] So the the whole thing is the same.
[1:57:45] And then he says
[1:57:47] &gt;&gt; all things were made by him
[1:57:51] &gt;&gt; is the same.
[1:57:59] &gt;&gt; I'll come back to that on the issue of
[1:58:02] the same.
[1:58:05] So this hymn
[1:58:07] is now the it's it's actually alluding
[1:58:09] to the sun
[1:58:13] the so now
[1:58:16] um because
[1:58:19] um
[1:58:20] the prophet says
[1:58:24] he was the weight
[1:58:26] &gt;&gt; which is the logos
[1:58:28] &gt;&gt; and then when he came down became a man
[1:58:33] then it says in him was life and the
[1:58:35] life was the light of man.
[1:58:40] And the light shined in darkness
[1:58:45] and darkness comprehended.
[1:58:51] Do you see light and darkness?
[1:58:55] Darkness
[1:58:57] is the absence of light.
[1:59:01] Then we say it's dark
[1:59:04] because this the light is not there.
[1:59:07] But when the light comes,
[1:59:11] darkness disappears.
[1:59:14] That is why when a child of God comes,
[1:59:18] the environment changes
[1:59:23] because darkness cannot comprehend
[1:59:25] light.
[1:59:28] When light comes,
[1:59:30] &gt;&gt; darkness disappears.
[1:59:37] &gt;&gt; And not understanding.
[1:59:40] I was resting here,
[1:59:43] but someone just came and I'm feeling so
[1:59:47] weak.
[1:59:49] My body is aching
[1:59:53] &gt;&gt; because the powers
[1:59:56] one is of light,
[1:59:58] one is of darkness. The power of light
[2:00:03] does not talk too much,
[2:00:07] waits for God to express.
[2:00:16] &gt;&gt; Then it says,
[2:00:18] There was a man sent from God whose name
[2:00:22] was John.
[2:00:27] Now
[2:00:29] it it's speaking of another man
[2:00:33] and pastor taught us very well
[2:00:37] that this man was not sent by
[2:00:43] was sent from
[2:00:48] Yes. Amen.
[2:00:49] &gt;&gt; Similar as the planets are coming from
[2:00:51] the sun.
[2:00:53] &gt;&gt; So John
[2:00:55] was coming
[2:00:58] from God.
[2:01:00] &gt;&gt; It's a he comes from another
[2:01:03] dispensation.
[2:01:06] John is coming from another
[2:01:07] dispensation.
[2:01:10] Before the foundation of the world, John
[2:01:12] was there.
[2:01:14] But at our allotted time,
[2:01:17] there was a spirit
[2:01:20] that moved
[2:01:22] from eternity
[2:01:24] and it crossed all the planets
[2:01:28] and it dropped down to John.
[2:01:32] Amen.
[2:01:36] &gt;&gt; And that spirit,
[2:01:39] &gt;&gt; it dropped to John before he was born.
[2:01:46] vindicating
[2:01:49] that this is the work of the Lord
[2:01:52] because Elizabeth
[2:01:54] was worried.
[2:01:57] No muscles checking, nothing.
[2:02:05] But when when when the two lights met
[2:02:09] in their mothers
[2:02:12] and then when the mothers greeted each
[2:02:14] other,
[2:02:17] &gt;&gt; the heavens
[2:02:19] ignited
[2:02:22] and gave life
[2:02:25] to to John
[2:02:29] and John. So John when he was here,
[2:02:32] he was born already predestinated of
[2:02:35] God.
[2:02:38] Is there something that you could do to
[2:02:39] John?
[2:02:41] You could take him to any university.
[2:02:45] That was the child of God.
[2:02:48] God took him to the wilderness himself.
[2:02:53] God purposefully brought John
[2:02:57] when the parents were old
[2:03:00] knowing that
[2:03:07] the days are numbered and then John came
[2:03:11] and then when John came
[2:03:14] God closed the files
[2:03:17] Elizabeth
[2:03:19] &gt;&gt; who was the father by the way and
[2:03:23] Amen.
[2:03:24] &gt;&gt; Then he said, "This one is mine."
[2:03:29] &gt;&gt; And then even before he closed the
[2:03:30] files,
[2:03:32] John John already loved to stay in the
[2:03:34] wilderness.
[2:03:38] And when he was preaching, he was
[2:03:40] preaching from the wilderness.
[2:03:44] But because he got the he had the
[2:03:46] magnetic power,
[2:03:49] people moved from the cities.
[2:03:51] coming to the wilderness
[2:03:55] because of the magnetic power
[2:03:58] of the light that was in John
[2:04:05] &gt;&gt; had serious magnetic power
[2:04:11] &gt;&gt; and even his his um what do you call
[2:04:14] this thing um
[2:04:18] you know when you make examples
[2:04:22] He used nature.
[2:04:24] &gt;&gt; Parables.
[2:04:25] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:04:27] &gt;&gt; When he used parables,
[2:04:29] &gt;&gt; he used nature
[2:04:32] &gt;&gt; showing that his university
[2:04:36] was the nature itself.
[2:04:40] The best university you can ever find
[2:04:43] is the natural one.
[2:04:48] No minis there.
[2:04:51] &gt;&gt; Let's read about this.
[2:04:55] &gt;&gt; And then it says, "The same came for a
[2:04:56] witness
[2:04:59] to bear witness of the light
[2:05:03] that all men through him might believe.
[2:05:07] He was not that light,
[2:05:09] but was sent to bear witness of that
[2:05:11] light.
[2:05:16] That was the true light which lighted
[2:05:18] every man that cometh into the world.
[2:05:25] So let me it says here he came for a
[2:05:29] witness
[2:05:33] and bearing witness of the light.
[2:05:37] Now in verse seven
[2:05:39] &gt;&gt; it says the same came for a witness.
[2:05:45] Now this is what I said I will explain
[2:05:47] later
[2:05:49] because in verse two it says the same
[2:05:51] was in the beginning with God.
[2:05:55] Now it goes on again. It says the same
[2:06:01] came for a witness
[2:06:04] to bear witness of the light.
[2:06:08] &gt;&gt; So there you see here
[2:06:10] &gt;&gt; the light
[2:06:12] &gt;&gt; it's the light with a capital L
[2:06:16] in verse seven.
[2:06:18] &gt;&gt; It's a light with capital L
[2:06:23] that all men through him might believe.
[2:06:27] And then it says he was not that light
[2:06:30] with a capital L.
[2:06:32] But he was coming to bear witness of
[2:06:34] that light.
[2:06:38] But when it started, remember that
[2:06:41] it says he came from God.
[2:06:46] So in other words, God gave you gave
[2:06:49] John
[2:06:51] a small portion
[2:06:54] of himself.
[2:06:57] &gt;&gt; And then that that that one was light,
[2:07:00] &gt;&gt; but we can't write it with a capital L.
[2:07:04] We'll write it with a small L.
[2:07:07] So when it says here, he was not that
[2:07:08] light.
[2:07:10] He was not the source.
[2:07:13] But he was coming to bear witness of the
[2:07:15] source.
[2:07:20] But if we put it plain
[2:07:23] because we are believers,
[2:07:26] the prophet says
[2:07:28] if you take a drop from the ocean,
[2:07:31] just a cup,
[2:07:34] he says potentially
[2:07:37] all the contents of the of the ocean
[2:07:41] in you. Are we together? So John though
[2:07:46] he was bearing witness of the light but
[2:07:49] he had the same.
[2:07:52] So this same
[2:07:54] keeps on going it is the same the same
[2:07:59] the same now we are not repeating
[2:08:02] ourselves.
[2:08:04] We are processing
[2:08:11] &gt;&gt; so that
[2:08:13] we can come to a point
[2:08:16] &gt;&gt; where we can appreciate
[2:08:20] what the Lord
[2:08:22] &gt;&gt; has done
[2:08:25] for mommy lord.
[2:08:30] Amen.
[2:08:33] It's not
[2:08:35] the making
[2:08:37] of a man.
[2:08:39] It's God
[2:08:41] &gt;&gt; building his own church.
[2:08:49] Now
[2:08:54] &gt;&gt; this night that we are talking about
[2:08:59] &gt;&gt; it requires
[2:09:02] &gt;&gt; that we
[2:09:05] become
[2:09:07] &gt;&gt; a different breed
[2:09:11] in the sense.
[2:09:15] &gt;&gt; You see
[2:09:16] um the um
[2:09:19] in the natural.
[2:09:21] There are those that are called
[2:09:23] astronauts.
[2:09:26] These are people
[2:09:28] that study the zodiac
[2:09:31] and they don't only study it.
[2:09:34] They even go
[2:09:37] to the outer space.
[2:09:40] Now, for you to be an astronaut,
[2:09:44] you know, you must be good with
[2:09:46] measurements.
[2:09:50] Your mathematics must be good.
[2:10:01] Then they just say condon you.
[2:10:07] You must pass with distinction
[2:10:11] to be that.
[2:10:13] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:10:15] In other words, you must be smart.
[2:10:21] You know, understand measurements.
[2:10:24] You know, when they talk when they talk
[2:10:25] about the speed of light,
[2:10:28] you must understand.
[2:10:30] And they talk about light years.
[2:10:35] It's a different language.
[2:10:39] And we no longer talking when we say
[2:10:40] light years.
[2:10:43] We have moved.
[2:10:45] to another level.
[2:10:48] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:10:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:51] &gt;&gt; Now
[2:10:54] we
[2:10:56] are spiritual astronauts.
[2:11:00] &gt;&gt; When it come to the word,
[2:11:03] &gt;&gt; we know the measurements.
[2:11:07] &gt;&gt; And when we pick you up, we pick you by
[2:11:10] the spirit
[2:11:12] &gt;&gt; that's operating in you.
[2:11:18] because the spirit will not fool you.
[2:11:22] Now
[2:11:25] &gt;&gt; these astronauts the astronauts
[2:11:29] &gt;&gt; um because they
[2:11:32] they study
[2:11:34] and they're looking
[2:11:37] they're not just studying
[2:11:39] &gt;&gt; actually
[2:11:40] you know there are certain things that I
[2:11:42] wanted to read
[2:11:44] Um maybe I will read it.
[2:11:49] &gt;&gt; But it's like this.
[2:11:54] &gt;&gt; Um the prophet
[2:11:58] speaks
[2:12:01] the that this world this missile earth.
[2:12:07] Yeah.
[2:12:10] inside it.
[2:12:14] It's got um
[2:12:20] gas,
[2:12:22] &gt;&gt; oil,
[2:12:24] water,
[2:12:26] h simply put
[2:12:31] it's explosive
[2:12:36] cuz he said two of it
[2:12:41] It's water.
[2:12:43] &gt;&gt; And he says water.
[2:12:45] &gt;&gt; It's hydrogen and oxygen.
[2:12:49] &gt;&gt; Explosive
[2:12:53] where you were sitting.
[2:12:55] &gt;&gt; Yeah. This is this is this is what I
[2:12:57] wanted my
[2:12:59] Yeah. He says, "And and the two of the
[2:13:01] earth
[2:13:04] &gt;&gt; better than two of it is in water.
[2:13:11] And oneird of it is in land
[2:13:18] about one/3
[2:13:21] &gt;&gt; and this is little.
[2:13:23] So it means greater part is water
[2:13:27] this crust that we are living on.
[2:13:30] It's full of dangerous explosives,
[2:13:37] gas, gasoline, oil, everything.
[2:13:42] Is that right? Amen.
[2:13:45] &gt;&gt; Those of you are in mining, you know,
[2:13:49] and the two of it.
[2:13:56] The formula of water,
[2:13:59] two parts is hydrogen,
[2:14:03] one part oxygen,
[2:14:06] explosive.
[2:14:08] And some says as we are sitting here,
[2:14:12] below us is hell.
[2:14:16] There's there's some heat there.
[2:14:20] If God can open for for us,
[2:14:24] &gt;&gt; this church would be full. Amen.
[2:14:27] If you can open for us hell,
[2:14:30] this church will always be full.
[2:14:38] &gt;&gt; Now,
[2:14:39] I was saying to you,
[2:14:43] &gt;&gt; the astronauts, astronauts,
[2:14:46] &gt;&gt; it's people
[2:14:49] that study
[2:14:51] &gt;&gt; and they studying.
[2:14:54] Remember these ones are not are not
[2:14:55] spiritual like us.
[2:14:59] We are spiritual astronauts.
[2:15:02] Can I get amen? Amen.
[2:15:07] &gt;&gt; These ones they are astronauts astronaut
[2:15:10] &gt;&gt; naturally speaking.
[2:15:13] Now
[2:15:15] part of their deal
[2:15:17] though they don't disclose it.
[2:15:21] They're actually looking
[2:15:24] which planet
[2:15:27] that we can go because rapture is coming
[2:15:32] &gt;&gt; and hell hell
[2:15:33] &gt;&gt; is going to be on earth.
[2:15:36] &gt;&gt; So we need another planet
[2:15:39] where we can migrate
[2:15:42] you know to run away from the earth of
[2:15:44] God.
[2:15:46] Can you run away from the wrath of God?
[2:15:50] God made the earth
[2:15:52] and the earth alone to be habitable.
[2:15:58] So they actually know that rapture is
[2:16:00] coming
[2:16:01] and hell is around the corner.
[2:16:04] It's going to be here on earth.
[2:16:08] Now I'm bringing to us that we
[2:16:13] let me say something about them though
[2:16:17] that I should give them credit
[2:16:21] because it's a risky job.
[2:16:26] So if you know when they go
[2:16:31] they don't wear in a suit like me
[2:16:33] they've got a special attire
[2:16:37] they jump into that one
[2:16:39] and they've got helmets
[2:16:41] helmet
[2:16:44] even if they pass
[2:16:47] you can see they not walking normal now
[2:16:52] they don't now walk with this gravity
[2:16:56] They have a gravity of where they're
[2:16:57] going.
[2:16:58] &gt;&gt; They like hopping.
[2:17:02] You have seen them.
[2:17:06] Now
[2:17:09] what they're doing actually
[2:17:12] there's no guarantee
[2:17:15] that you will come back.
[2:17:17] You can go and it can be a oneway
[2:17:19] ticket.
[2:17:26] Because
[2:17:28] &gt;&gt; it is it's another environment.
[2:17:38] &gt;&gt; Whatever you're using to get there,
[2:17:40] might not be able to to come
[2:17:44] and if he doesn't
[2:17:46] then you're in trouble.
[2:17:49] Then you have to communicate maybe with
[2:17:51] the tower down there if there's
[2:17:53] communication.
[2:17:55] But this is the credit that I want to
[2:17:56] give them
[2:18:00] that they are prepared
[2:18:02] to take one one way ticket.
[2:18:06] If you can find somebody who is willing
[2:18:10] to take a oneway ticket
[2:18:12] like
[2:18:14] he took a oneway ticket
[2:18:20] but because he's a spiritual astronaut.
[2:18:25] He is in a better space
[2:18:30] and I must be honest
[2:18:35] sometimes when I think as a human being
[2:18:40] I get this thoughts that
[2:18:42] you know God wherever he is with pastor
[2:18:47] and the saints
[2:18:49] he's able to say look at the brethren
[2:18:52] down
[2:19:02] So if you know him,
[2:19:06] &gt;&gt; you know what he wants.
[2:19:08] &gt;&gt; That is if you know him.
[2:19:16] Now
[2:19:18] &gt;&gt; um
[2:19:21] I'm also ready for one ticket by the
[2:19:22] way.
[2:19:29] All of you actually you are ready.
[2:19:33] That's what Paul says.
[2:19:35] Paul says
[2:19:37] if it was me,
[2:19:42] &gt;&gt; but because
[2:19:44] I'm still here
[2:19:46] because I'm still here. But here is
[2:19:50] here's the thing
[2:19:55] &gt;&gt; which I want us to look at as we are
[2:19:59] looking now at the spiritual part of it
[2:20:03] because the spiritual astronauts
[2:20:08] their duty is to follow the light
[2:20:13] and why are they following that light?
[2:20:16] It's because of the magnetic power.
[2:20:20] that is in that light.
[2:20:24] &gt;&gt; It's able to translate
[2:20:30] us
[2:20:32] &gt;&gt; into sons
[2:20:35] &gt;&gt; of God.
[2:20:37] &gt;&gt; You know the translation power,
[2:20:42] it's something that
[2:20:45] &gt;&gt; when
[2:20:47] it hits
[2:20:52] you you don't have an option.
[2:20:58] &gt;&gt; It's God himself
[2:21:01] doing his work.
[2:21:05] &gt;&gt; Now,
[2:21:08] let me read uh Colossians Colossians 1
[2:21:11] verse 13
[2:21:14] just to
[2:21:33] You can read it for us, my brother.
[2:21:34] Colossians 1:3.
[2:21:36] &gt;&gt; Colossians chapter 1 verse 13.
[2:21:38] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:21:40] who have delivered us from the power of
[2:21:42] darkness and have translated us into the
[2:21:45] kingdom of his dear son.
[2:21:49] Yeah. Now Paul here's
[2:21:54] talking about the father
[2:21:56] you know he says giving thanks to the
[2:21:58] father
[2:22:00] which had made us meet to be partakers
[2:22:03] of the inheritance of the saints in
[2:22:05] light.
[2:22:12] So to partake
[2:22:15] it must be in light.
[2:22:17] You know light is something very great.
[2:22:21] Even when you want to test
[2:22:25] um something that is not fake or not
[2:22:29] fake,
[2:22:32] you want to test money.
[2:22:35] you know, they put it under the light.
[2:22:38] They know that something is going to
[2:22:40] reflect
[2:22:43] the paper.
[2:22:45] &gt;&gt; They're not worried about, but there's
[2:22:47] something that is like magnetic in the
[2:22:49] mind.
[2:22:53] It's more like it's a it's not paper.
[2:22:57] It's more like it's plastic.
[2:23:00] &gt;&gt; It's like it's magnet.
[2:23:02] &gt;&gt; When you flash it in that light,
[2:23:05] It starts to show something
[2:23:08] that the imposters
[2:23:12] the imposters
[2:23:14] um
[2:23:15] by
[2:23:19] &gt;&gt; the imposters
[2:23:21] &gt;&gt; those that cope. Yes. Yes.
[2:23:24] &gt;&gt; Yes. So that the imposters
[2:23:27] &gt;&gt; will never be able to emulate it. They
[2:23:32] don't have the material
[2:23:34] to emulate that
[2:23:36] for you to see that. It must be put
[2:23:39] under the light.
[2:23:41] If you hold it like this,
[2:23:43] it's just an it's it's just paper. But
[2:23:46] if you put it under the right light,
[2:23:49] it start to glow
[2:23:52] showing that this is genuine. This is
[2:23:55] not genuine. So light is able to bring
[2:24:00] the difference between a true Christian
[2:24:04] and a make believer
[2:24:07] because you find make believers and you
[2:24:10] find Christians.
[2:24:12] But it is the light that is able to put
[2:24:16] them under itself
[2:24:19] under the supervision of the light you
[2:24:22] will see reflections.
[2:24:25] You don't have to rush.
[2:24:28] Take your time and look at it. Then you
[2:24:32] will see as it moves that this is of God
[2:24:36] and this is not of God.
[2:24:44] That that that's how our spiritual
[2:24:48] part
[2:24:52] is.
[2:24:54] um structured.
[2:24:57] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:24:59] Now, um,
[2:25:01] in closing,
[2:25:06] don't forget that
[2:25:10] &gt;&gt; you
[2:25:13] were delivered
[2:25:16] from the power of darkness
[2:25:21] and translated
[2:25:23] &gt;&gt; into a kingdom
[2:25:26] of his dear S.
[2:25:30] Now in the kingdom of the s
[2:25:35] that is where there is peace
[2:25:38] longsuffering
[2:25:40] praying for one another.
[2:25:43] Are we together? That is the the the
[2:25:46] kingdom of the son.
[2:25:49] Now um let me pick up something that we
[2:25:54] we read last time
[2:25:57] in closing.
[2:26:00] &gt;&gt; Last time when we here
[2:26:02] we we read the spoken with the seven se
[2:26:08] I think it was paragraph 43
[2:26:13] &gt;&gt; if I recall well. Amen.
[2:26:16] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:26:18] This is what we read.
[2:26:20] It says, "You remember the little bitty
[2:26:24] messengers? They went east.
[2:26:29] The second messengers
[2:26:34] a little bit larger.
[2:26:36] They went east
[2:26:40] and then I looked.
[2:26:43] They was with me all the time.
[2:26:47] That was the first and the second pool.
[2:26:53] Now the third
[2:26:56] came from the west
[2:26:59] sweeping with great terrific speed.
[2:27:05] They picked me up
[2:27:09] &gt;&gt; that was coming back east
[2:27:13] with the mystery of the seven
[2:27:19] just like it said in Junior Jackson's
[2:27:21] dream
[2:27:24] that the Lord let me interpret
[2:27:30] on the inside of the pyramid
[2:27:33] there was a white stone
[2:27:36] that was wasn't written on.
[2:27:41] Let's stop there for a while. So, we we
[2:27:43] we want to pick up that
[2:27:46] remember the whole thing we said it's
[2:27:47] it's aligned.
[2:27:50] &gt;&gt; It started in the zodiac
[2:27:54] and then it came to the pyramid
[2:27:58] and it came in the word form.
[2:28:02] &gt;&gt; Now, the prophet
[2:28:06] He
[2:28:07] had
[2:28:10] a duty
[2:28:12] &gt;&gt; you know like John
[2:28:16] John had a duty
[2:28:18] &gt;&gt; and his duty was that
[2:28:22] um you must introduce him
[2:28:25] that why he says I'm not that light
[2:28:29] &gt;&gt; he is coming
[2:28:31] &gt;&gt; but H for him to introduce Jesus,
[2:28:38] he had to see something first
[2:28:43] and he had to see light
[2:28:47] in a form of a dove
[2:28:50] because he says the one that sent me
[2:28:55] said to me
[2:28:58] on whom I see
[2:29:01] the spirit of God descending
[2:29:05] &gt;&gt; like a dove and remain on him that is
[2:29:09] him.
[2:29:11] &gt;&gt; So
[2:29:12] all along
[2:29:14] John
[2:29:15] &gt;&gt; did not know who he was going to
[2:29:17] introduce
[2:29:19] he was waiting for a spiritual
[2:29:22] &gt;&gt; sign.
[2:29:24] That spiritual sign
[2:29:26] came. It was God himself in a hallow of
[2:29:30] light.
[2:29:33] This hollow of light came down
[2:29:38] to identify Jesus.
[2:29:40] As much as it it identified the seventh
[2:29:43] man
[2:29:45] is the same hall of life
[2:29:50] that John saw
[2:29:53] and he saw it remaining on him.
[2:29:56] And then when he introduced him,
[2:29:58] &gt;&gt; he said, "Behold the lamb of God."
[2:30:02] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:30:04] &gt;&gt; What an introduction.
[2:30:08] &gt;&gt; Only the spiritual people
[2:30:10] that were waiting for the lamp knew what
[2:30:13] was happening.
[2:30:16] Let me say something here
[2:30:18] maybe. Or let's read Luke 23:45.
[2:30:30] Luke 3 verse 25
[2:30:32] &gt;&gt; 23 Luke 23
[2:30:34] &gt;&gt; verse 45
[2:30:37] Luke 23
[2:30:41] verse 45
[2:30:44] and the sun was darkened and the veil of
[2:30:47] the temple was rent in the midst
[2:30:51] and 46
[2:30:52] &gt;&gt; and when Jesus Jesus had cried with a
[2:30:54] loud voice. He said, "Father, into thy
[2:30:57] hands I commit command my spirit."
[2:31:00] &gt;&gt; Okay. Now,
[2:31:02] &gt;&gt; if you take the book of Joshua,
[2:31:05] &gt;&gt; chapter 10,
[2:31:07] &gt;&gt; that's the one that tells you,
[2:31:11] &gt;&gt; if you can reflect for us, Joshua
[2:31:12] chapter 10 there
[2:31:16] &gt;&gt; on the screen.
[2:31:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:31:20] &gt;&gt; Yeah. It says, "And the sun stood still
[2:31:24] and the moon stayed
[2:31:28] until the people had avenged themselves
[2:31:30] upon themselves."
[2:31:35] Is not this written in the book of Jes.
[2:31:39] So the son stood still in the midst of
[2:31:42] heaven
[2:31:46] and has not
[2:31:50] and and hasted not to go down about a
[2:31:54] whole day.
[2:32:01] Joshua
[2:32:02] &gt;&gt; Joshua
[2:32:04] if if you read with the other verses
[2:32:06] there
[2:32:10] &gt;&gt; was in battle
[2:32:14] &gt;&gt; and he asked
[2:32:18] the son
[2:32:21] stop
[2:32:24] now I have said to
[2:32:28] In fact, the sun is not moving.
[2:32:33] What is moving
[2:32:35] &gt;&gt; is the planet.
[2:32:37] The earth
[2:32:39] &gt;&gt; rotates
[2:32:41] and revolves.
[2:32:43] The sun
[2:32:45] is on the throne.
[2:32:48] In the throne, you find four beasts,
[2:32:53] four beings.
[2:32:55] Four. Yeah, four living creatures and
[2:32:58] the 24 elders
[2:33:00] round about the throne. I'm just trying
[2:33:02] to show you the spiritual setup and the
[2:33:06] natural setup
[2:33:08] that these things are aligned.
[2:33:12] &gt;&gt; Now
[2:33:15] the the throne
[2:33:17] &gt;&gt; is there.
[2:33:21] You know the the pastor put it
[2:33:23] beautifully. He says one day
[2:33:26] Why there was silence in heaven?
[2:33:29] Why there was silence in heaven
[2:33:32] is because
[2:33:35] when he moved from the throne
[2:33:37] to take another throne
[2:33:40] in in heaven there was silence
[2:33:46] because in heaven
[2:33:48] there's always holy holy holy
[2:33:52] &gt;&gt; in the setup.
[2:33:55] That is why in Job, one of the questions
[2:33:58] is where were you when the sons when the
[2:34:02] stars of God
[2:34:04] sang together
[2:34:09] and
[2:34:11] the sons shouted for joy.
[2:34:17] So this singing together
[2:34:20] is the living creatures.
[2:34:23] They say holy, holy, holy, holy.
[2:34:27] &gt;&gt; Now um
[2:34:30] okay, let's leave the set up. Let me let
[2:34:32] me go to my point
[2:34:34] &gt;&gt; because we have to close.
[2:34:37] &gt;&gt; Um I spoke about Joshua
[2:34:41] &gt;&gt; that Joshua
[2:34:43] &gt;&gt; came
[2:34:45] and said son stop.
[2:34:48] According to science,
[2:34:51] the sun is not moving.
[2:34:55] It is the other planets that are moving.
[2:34:59] &gt;&gt; Right now, let me put it simple again.
[2:35:01] In our
[2:35:04] way of speaking,
[2:35:06] even when we talk,
[2:35:09] I will say to you before the sun sets,
[2:35:13] &gt;&gt; have you done one, two, three?
[2:35:17] &gt;&gt; Are we together? We say the sun is
[2:35:19] setting.
[2:35:20] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:35:22] &gt;&gt; Why is because
[2:35:25] we keep time
[2:35:28] by the sun
[2:35:29] but in fact it's not moving.
[2:35:33] &gt;&gt; It's only the earth that is moving.
[2:35:36] So in other words I'm trying to say to
[2:35:38] you
[2:35:40] when he said son stop
[2:35:43] it meant the whole solar
[2:35:46] &gt;&gt; had to stop
[2:35:53] and then he said son stop
[2:35:56] because it's naturally for a man
[2:36:00] to attribute time to the son.
[2:36:05] That's what we do.
[2:36:07] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:36:09] &gt;&gt; Do you agree with me that the earth is
[2:36:11] the one that is moving?
[2:36:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:36:16] &gt;&gt; So it it is one man.
[2:36:20] What manner of man
[2:36:22] that is able to say
[2:36:25] son stop
[2:36:28] you interrupting
[2:36:31] &gt;&gt; with the solar systemar
[2:36:34] system
[2:36:34] &gt;&gt; you interrupting
[2:36:38] with the milky way galaxy
[2:36:42] you are interrupting
[2:36:45] &gt;&gt; with the whole creation
[2:36:51] Who can do that?
[2:36:54] &gt;&gt; It's not Joshua.
[2:36:56] &gt;&gt; It's someone through Joshua
[2:37:02] and he was able to do that once
[2:37:06] with Joshua.
[2:37:08] &gt;&gt; That's what one of the other verses
[2:37:09] says. It says there was not any other
[2:37:12] time
[2:37:13] that God heedened unto a man
[2:37:18] God listen to a man like he listened to
[2:37:21] the request of Joshua.
[2:37:26] Joshua had a difficult request
[2:37:29] and and when he requested it, he was in
[2:37:33] battle. He didn't he didn't even have
[2:37:36] time to pray.
[2:37:38] He just spoke it.
[2:37:41] And it happened.
[2:37:45] &gt;&gt; It said about the whole day.
[2:37:50] &gt;&gt; Well, I don't know when it started.
[2:37:53] I don't know when it start. What time
[2:37:55] was it? But the verses
[2:37:58] the whole day
[2:38:01] we can say of what was remaining of the
[2:38:03] day
[2:38:06] job I mean
[2:38:08] &gt;&gt; Joshua
[2:38:10] &gt;&gt; was able to speak
[2:38:13] &gt;&gt; and it pleased God.
[2:38:16] &gt;&gt; Now that is why I've combined this
[2:38:20] &gt;&gt; with Luke 23 Luke 23. Luke 23 says
[2:38:25] &gt;&gt; Luke 23
[2:38:26] &gt;&gt; 45 Luke 23:45
[2:38:27] &gt;&gt; Amen. It says
[2:38:36] &gt;&gt; okay then 1344 it and it was about the
[2:38:39] sixth hour
[2:38:42] &gt;&gt; and there was darkness over all the
[2:38:44] earth until the 9th hour
[2:38:49] and the sun was darkened
[2:38:52] and the veil of the temple was rent in
[2:38:54] the midst.
[2:38:57] And when Jesus had cried with a loud
[2:38:59] voice,
[2:39:02] &gt;&gt; Father, into thy hands,
[2:39:06] &gt;&gt; I commend my spirit.
[2:39:10] Now here
[2:39:13] &gt;&gt; we find
[2:39:15] &gt;&gt; another
[2:39:16] Joshua was an astronaut astronaut
[2:39:20] &gt;&gt; uh because you know
[2:39:23] so here we find another
[2:39:26] &gt;&gt; which is the Lord Jesus Christ.
[2:39:30] So
[2:39:32] with him
[2:39:34] there came a time
[2:39:36] where the fulfillment
[2:39:40] of why he was here
[2:39:44] came to meet him.
[2:39:46] Remember he was introduced as the lamp
[2:39:49] going to be slain.
[2:39:52] That's why he's introduced as the lamb.
[2:39:54] It means he's going to the slaughter,
[2:39:58] right?
[2:40:00] to pay
[2:40:02] &gt;&gt; our price.
[2:40:07] &gt;&gt; So when that time comes
[2:40:11] &gt;&gt; and he was there,
[2:40:16] God
[2:40:17] also took another form.
[2:40:21] &gt;&gt; Actually the son
[2:40:23] the the su
[2:40:26] darkened
[2:40:30] This time
[2:40:32] &gt;&gt; there was no request.
[2:40:34] &gt;&gt; The son,
[2:40:36] &gt;&gt; the s
[2:40:38] &gt;&gt; recognizes
[2:40:40] who is in charge.
[2:40:44] The sun
[2:40:46] was able to recognize
[2:40:49] my lord is going for crucification.
[2:40:53] I'm going to put myself on him.
[2:40:58] And it says the sun darkened.
[2:41:02] &gt;&gt; So the son was mourning
[2:41:05] mourning that my lord
[2:41:08] having done nothing
[2:41:11] is been taken for crucification
[2:41:14] and the light had to
[2:41:17] honor
[2:41:20] the creator
[2:41:22] who became man.
[2:41:24] to say this one
[2:41:28] I cannot shine anymore.
[2:41:34] &gt;&gt; It was testifying
[2:41:37] that the one that you have is the one
[2:41:40] that created everything.
[2:41:45] They should have listened to Albert
[2:41:48] Einstein.
[2:41:50] Albert Einstein, one of the great
[2:41:52] scientist
[2:41:54] who also studied the universe
[2:41:58] and
[2:42:00] while studying
[2:42:02] he had a ambition
[2:42:07] to the sun.
[2:42:10] He wanted to reach the sun
[2:42:13] because he believed that if we can reach
[2:42:16] there, we can create wealths.
[2:42:20] He had a revelation that the power that
[2:42:23] I see here that is the source
[2:42:28] if I can go there I can create wealth
[2:42:31] but he realized that
[2:42:36] and with the small paras that he had
[2:42:41] he realized that
[2:42:44] it's far
[2:42:46] &gt;&gt; then he said if God doesn't put these
[2:42:50] things in us,
[2:42:52] we have no answer.
[2:42:56] That was his conclusion.
[2:43:00] I'm also saying
[2:43:02] if God if we don't trust in God,
[2:43:06] we will never have an answer.
[2:43:10] We must put our trust
[2:43:13] in God. God is the one that is
[2:43:17] responsible.
[2:43:19] He is the one that will put everything
[2:43:23] under the light.
[2:43:25] &gt;&gt; The search light.
[2:43:30] You know this this light must have the
[2:43:32] searching power
[2:43:35] and when when it searches it can find
[2:43:37] hidden things and when it finds them it
[2:43:42] brings them to the housetop
[2:43:45] that's what the Bible says those things
[2:43:48] that are hidden will be brought to the
[2:43:50] rooftop
[2:43:52] so that everyone can see
[2:43:55] ours is to keep our track
[2:43:59] where you are worshiping,
[2:44:02] where you are placed, just keep your tag
[2:44:08] and and and leave mine
[2:44:10] and leave his
[2:44:23] &gt;&gt; No,
[2:44:26] um
[2:44:27] I was I was actually on But you see
[2:44:30] light has got very
[2:44:32] it's taking me here and there. I was we
[2:44:35] were reading something
[2:44:38] that um quotation from the seven se
[2:44:44] in closing now
[2:44:46] &gt;&gt; where the
[2:44:48] prophet says
[2:44:54] and the angels took me into the pyramid
[2:44:56] of themselves.
[2:45:01] The mysteries of God known only to them.
[2:45:08] And now them was the messengers had to
[2:45:12] come to interpret.
[2:45:19] And now here's the thing. Now we are
[2:45:23] happy you are all aligned.
[2:45:27] And then
[2:45:30] Jesus came paid the price.
[2:45:34] Now we have the seventh man
[2:45:37] who says
[2:45:39] there is a mystery and he says there is
[2:45:43] a white rock
[2:45:45] that is not written.
[2:45:47] And then he says
[2:45:50] these messengers that came
[2:45:53] they put me in the pyramid of themselves
[2:45:57] because everything now has to be
[2:45:58] aligned.
[2:46:00] You know even the structure of a human
[2:46:02] being
[2:46:04] is that of a pyramid.
[2:46:06] Are we together? Now uh these angels
[2:46:10] put them there
[2:46:13] h to interpret
[2:46:16] to him
[2:46:18] &gt;&gt; the mystery.
[2:46:20] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:46:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:46:23] &gt;&gt; Because you know
[2:46:26] um when you read about the sins
[2:46:30] the seventh sin
[2:46:32] there's always this problem that it's
[2:46:34] not revealed.
[2:46:38] Are we together?
[2:46:39] &gt;&gt; So now these angels
[2:46:42] were there
[2:46:44] to make it plain.
[2:46:50] H maybe let me read this
[2:46:53] and combine it with who is this
[2:46:56] melisedc.
[2:46:58] Who is this melisedc paragraph 22?
[2:47:01] &gt;&gt; Paragraph 22.
[2:47:02] &gt;&gt; Then I close. I promise you.
[2:47:07] I think they can just flesh it there.
[2:47:09] The who is this mech? Who is this mec?
[2:47:12] &gt;&gt; Yes, there we go.
[2:47:14] &gt;&gt; And listen friends, God confirmed his
[2:47:16] word with signs and vindicates to prove
[2:47:18] that it's right.
[2:47:26] The spoken words.
[2:47:30] Now remember that that light was in the
[2:47:33] cloud that day.
[2:47:36] that gave the revelation.
[2:47:41] &gt;&gt; Then it says, "My little girl was
[2:47:42] telling me
[2:47:45] Sarah
[2:47:47] here."
[2:47:50] Now let me explain this one quick.
[2:47:53] It was that cloud
[2:47:55] that came.
[2:47:58] Um he says there was a light
[2:48:02] in the cloud.
[2:48:04] Are we together? So he says um my little
[2:48:08] daughter
[2:48:10] at school they even released them
[2:48:15] as they were as they were seeing.
[2:48:18] It was a cloudless day.
[2:48:21] But there was just this one cloud
[2:48:24] just going up and down like this.
[2:48:28] And then they looked at this cloud.
[2:48:30] They could see that this is something
[2:48:31] else.
[2:48:33] Yes, that is the cloud.
[2:48:35] Then
[2:48:37] &gt;&gt; even the teacher,
[2:48:40] &gt;&gt; Sarah's teacher
[2:48:42] dismissed the class.
[2:48:46] In my time when they dismissed us,
[2:48:49] it was only when it was snowing.
[2:48:53] But this day,
[2:48:54] it was a blessed dismissal.
[2:48:59] Because they were seeing something
[2:49:02] that is an answer to humankind
[2:49:06] a pyramid of angels.
[2:49:10] &gt;&gt; Putting a man in itself.
[2:49:18] &gt;&gt; Maybe let me just read quickly five
[2:49:21] minutes.
[2:49:23] &gt;&gt; It says here
[2:49:26] that school there in Arizona. I was
[2:49:28] looking up
[2:49:31] on the clouded sky
[2:49:34] and seeing this cloud mysteriously in
[2:49:36] that mountain
[2:49:40] going up and down with an ember fire
[2:49:42] burning in it.
[2:49:46] The teacher dismissed the class
[2:49:50] and brought them out front and said,
[2:49:53] "Did you ever see anything like that?
[2:49:56] Look the way that's there."
[2:50:00] So, you can see that it's it's God
[2:50:03] showing that this is the supernatural
[2:50:06] there's a light up there. Then it says
[2:50:10] here, remember that's the same ember
[2:50:14] light
[2:50:15] that's on the rock.
[2:50:18] So it's the same God,
[2:50:20] same revelation.
[2:50:24] Tell them to do this.
[2:50:28] So what what I wanted to bring here is
[2:50:31] that it is the same God
[2:50:35] that God that said in the beginning
[2:50:40] I mean Moses said in the beginning
[2:50:44] said let us create that same God became
[2:50:47] a hallow of light
[2:50:50] and and the prophet here he calls it an
[2:50:54] amber light on the rock
[2:50:58] because now this remember this rock is
[2:51:00] not written
[2:51:02] but it needs to be interpreted.
[2:51:05] Have you seen such a thing? people
[2:51:08] interested in a rock that does not have
[2:51:10] a life.
[2:51:14] That tells you
[2:51:17] there is something
[2:51:19] that this these angels had to utter
[2:51:23] for that for that utterance to happen
[2:51:26] they had to give brotherham
[2:51:28] a revelation.
[2:51:31] Then once he has a revelation
[2:51:34] because that's what it says. So it's the
[2:51:35] same God, same revelation.
[2:51:38] So once he picks up the revelation
[2:51:41] and then it means
[2:51:44] now he has seen the writing on the rock.
[2:51:50] It's a rock without the writing.
[2:51:52] But when the light comes,
[2:51:55] you know, like Moses when he went up the
[2:51:57] mountain,
[2:51:59] took two table stones,
[2:52:02] writing through fire,
[2:52:04] through light, he had to write the ten
[2:52:07] commandments.
[2:52:09] Those stones were not written. But when
[2:52:12] he came back from the mountain, there
[2:52:15] was a writing.
[2:52:17] Now,
[2:52:19] brother Benham,
[2:52:21] &gt;&gt; when he came out
[2:52:23] from that constellation
[2:52:26] of angels,
[2:52:31] &gt;&gt; he came with the interpretation.
[2:52:35] First revelation,
[2:52:37] second interpretation. Then when he
[2:52:40] comes to interpret, he's interpreting
[2:52:42] us.
[2:52:44] God bless you.
[2:52:54] Thank you so much
[2:52:56] um for being such a good audience.
[2:53:01] It is through your prayers
[2:53:04] that you are able to have this
[2:53:06] environment
[2:53:09] and may the good Lord.
[2:53:13] May he strengthen us
[2:53:16] as a church
[2:53:18] that we may be able
[2:53:20] when they look down on us,
[2:53:24] they can be proud to say this is what we
[2:53:27] taught them.
[2:53:33] So let me hand over to you go maybe you
[2:53:37] can just um say a song and um I give to
[2:53:43] our MC
[2:53:45] and God bless you.
[2:53:58] Oh, the more
[2:54:01] that I love him,

[2:55:16] And all
[2:55:18] my eyes
[2:55:27] there
[2:55:41] are All
[2:55:44] that I
[2:55:51] keep

[2:56:02] &gt;&gt; Oh
[2:56:04] my
[2:56:09] god.
[2:56:16] &gt;&gt; He stays like heaven.
[2:56:22] is my head
[2:56:25] and my heart.
[2:56:29] Oh my god.
[2:56:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:56:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:56:52] Thank you so much uh brother. God bless
[2:56:55] you.
[2:56:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:56:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:57:00] &gt;&gt; We are going to baptism.
[2:57:05] &gt;&gt; God has spoken to us.
[2:57:09] &gt;&gt; And we are happy.
[2:57:13] Amen.
[2:57:17] as I'm going to request my elder there
[2:57:23] just to come and pray for us
[2:57:26] after the word.
[2:57:29] It reminds me this song that sings.
[2:57:51] When I remember when I
[2:58:01] will I will never
[2:58:06] go back.
[2:58:10] When I remember,
[2:58:14] when I
[2:58:18] &gt;&gt; was the Lord,
[2:58:25] &gt;&gt; I will never forget.
[2:58:31] &gt;&gt; I will never go back anymore.
[2:58:39] What the Lord
[2:58:41] has done,
[2:58:43] &gt;&gt; I will never.
[2:58:50] &gt;&gt; They say, "No, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[2:58:53] no,
[2:58:58] no, no, no, no, no.
[2:59:03] I will
[2:59:05] go back.
[2:59:11] No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[2:59:13] no, no, no.
[2:59:37] Mighty God,
[2:59:40] the greatest one
[2:59:43] this morning, Lord Almighty,
[2:59:46] each and every one of us,
[2:59:49] when we woke up,
[2:59:52] we knel down and say, "Father,
[2:59:56] we are going to a meeting.
[2:59:59] We're going to a service
[3:00:02] to hear your word.
[3:00:05] &gt;&gt; Therefore, Lord, after that word,
[3:00:09] we with our heads bowed,
[3:00:12] &gt;&gt; we would like to thank you, Father.
[3:00:16] You gave us a substance
[3:00:18] of things that we are hoping for.
[3:00:23] You gave us an evidence, Lord Almighty.
[3:00:28] &gt;&gt; Of the word, Lord Almighty,
[3:00:32] that was the one that created us.
[3:00:36] We like to thank you, Father, for
[3:00:38] honoring us as we have honored thee.
[3:00:43] There was a day when your son said,
[3:00:47] "Father,
[3:00:50] praying Lord," in the book of John 17,
[3:00:54] he said, "Glorify me
[3:00:58] so that I could glorify thee, Lord."
[3:01:01] And today, Father,
[3:01:04] now that you have glorified us,
[3:01:07] we give that glory back to thee, Lord.
[3:01:11] because thou knew better than us.
[3:01:15] &gt;&gt; You knew us Lord before the foundation
[3:01:17] of the world.
[3:01:20] &gt;&gt; And you knew the Lord Almighty that a
[3:01:23] day like this will come
[3:01:26] and father you know
[3:01:29] when this day comes how should we behave
[3:01:33] and how should we react.
[3:01:36] We like to thank you father for the
[3:01:39] mercy and grace that you have done onto
[3:01:41] our life especially lord almighty
[3:01:45] the word that is relevant
[3:01:49] &gt;&gt; to our time.
[3:01:51] Thank you father.
[3:01:54] Bless our brother here Muketi
[3:01:58] for standing behind this pullpit
[3:02:01] and Lord Almighty
[3:02:03] preaching to us through your inspiration
[3:02:07] and through your anointing.
[3:02:11] Bless this church Lord Almighty
[3:02:14] that you open Lord Almighty a ground and
[3:02:17] open up a heart that could receive your
[3:02:21] word. Lord,
[3:02:23] &gt;&gt; there was a time where the Pharisees,
[3:02:25] the Sadducees, the scribes wanted to
[3:02:28] kill you because you said
[3:02:33] you were there before Abraham was.
[3:02:37] and gracious heavenly father,
[3:02:40] here we are this day, Father,
[3:02:43] being recognized as the seed of Abraham,
[3:02:47] &gt;&gt; standing here, Lord Almighty, opening
[3:02:49] our hearts,
[3:02:52] you said to them, you want to kill me
[3:02:55] because my word has got no place in your
[3:02:59] heart.
[3:03:01] Father, we are so thankful because your
[3:03:04] word has got a place, Lord Almighty, in
[3:03:07] our hearts. Therefore, bless your
[3:03:10] church, Lord. Bless everybody
[3:03:14] that is under this roof, Lord Almighty.
[3:03:18] As they will be going out, bless them,
[3:03:21] Lord Almighty. Sanctify them.
[3:03:24] &gt;&gt; Give them Lord Almighty, the request of
[3:03:26] their hearts.
[3:03:27] &gt;&gt; In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, we
[3:03:30] pray. Amen.
[3:03:38] &gt;&gt; As we prepare for the baptism, our
[3:03:41] brother will just lead us.
[3:03:45] God bless you.
[3:03:58] again.
[3:04:23] Get
[3:04:32] sitting head on our way
[3:04:38] on our way
[3:04:48] in
[3:04:52] empty.
[3:05:02] Get
[3:05:15] together.
[3:05:27] We are
[3:05:45] single
[3:05:59] city.
[3:06:13] This is our way.
[3:06:17] Heaven
[3:06:26] sh
[3:06:41] of
[3:06:43] our way
[3:06:45] of our way.
[3:06:55] sitting in Morning.
[3:07:22] Somebody
[3:07:49] Who are you in our
[3:08:05] city?
[3:08:14] I'm a
[3:08:32] You on my side
[3:08:45] to my
[3:09:02] Hallelujah.
[3:09:04] Glory. Glory. Glory.
[3:09:08] &gt;&gt; At this time, Basalan, let me just
[3:09:10] request our elder just to come and pray
[3:09:14] for us shortly before we go to the word.
[3:09:17] Amen. And then our brother will come
[3:09:21] with the word. God bless you. Amen.
[3:09:27] Can we bow our heads? Dear heavenly
[3:09:30] father.
[3:09:32] We glorify your name. We honor you. We
[3:09:34] salute you for the great word that spoke
[3:09:38] we spoke to us this afternoon.
[3:09:42] Father, we come to you with this great
[3:09:44] service
[3:09:45] through the mouth of the prophet. You
[3:09:48] taught us that it's so important to be
[3:09:50] baptized
[3:09:51] is for us to repent and be baptized in
[3:09:54] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Here
[3:09:57] we are today fulfilling the very same
[3:09:59] scriptures that you spoke since in the
[3:10:03] beginning through the pillar of fire
[3:10:05] that led the children of Israel when
[3:10:08] they went out from Egypt to the promised
[3:10:10] land. There was that pillar of light,
[3:10:12] Lord, the supernatural light. And your
[3:10:16] word says all Israel were baptized under
[3:10:20] that cloud.
[3:10:22] And you told Moses that they must not
[3:10:25] cry, but they must speak.
[3:10:28] That Moses can speak the word and
[3:10:30] they'll cross over. And the Bible says
[3:10:33] they were all baptized in that pillar of
[3:10:36] fire. They were baptized in that Red
[3:10:39] Sea. And that was typing the baptismal
[3:10:43] of what we have today.
[3:10:45] John saw that
[3:10:48] dove, that spirit of God coming upon
[3:10:51] Jesus
[3:10:53] and he said, "Let us fulfill all
[3:10:56] righteousness." John was worthy to
[3:11:00] baptize Jesus because he was going to be
[3:11:02] a sacrificial lamb. And in the last
[3:11:06] days, Father, you make a way for us as
[3:11:09] your children, that each and every one
[3:11:11] of us who repents and be baptized, you
[3:11:14] will come in, Father. Here are the souls
[3:11:17] that are standing before us. They've
[3:11:19] received your word, Lord. They are now
[3:11:22] identifying themselves with thee. As
[3:11:25] they are going in to be baptized
[3:11:27] together with those brothers, we'll be
[3:11:29] baptizing them. Lord, we believe that
[3:11:32] the same God who created all heaven and
[3:11:35] earth will come inside them, Lord, to
[3:11:38] make them sons and daughters of the
[3:11:40] living God because they were children of
[3:11:42] God before the foundation of the world.
[3:11:44] Today, they are standing here to
[3:11:46] identify themselves with the word that
[3:11:49] was delivered in this last days. Bless
[3:11:51] each and each and everything that's
[3:11:53] going to be done right now in the mighty
[3:11:55] name of our Lord and Savior Jesus
[3:11:56] Christ. Amen.
[3:11:58] Acts
[3:12:04] chapter 2 from verse 36-39.
[3:12:08] Therefore, let all the house of Israel
[3:12:10] know assuredly that God hath made that
[3:12:13] same Jesus whom he hath crucified both
[3:12:16] Lord and Christ. Now when they heard
[3:12:19] this, they were pricked in their heart
[3:12:22] and said unto Peter and to the rest of
[3:12:24] the apostles, Men and brethren, what
[3:12:26] shall we do? Then Peter said unto them,
[3:12:29] "Repent and be baptized, every one of
[3:12:32] you, in the name of Jesus Christ, for
[3:12:34] the remission of sins, and ye shall
[3:12:37] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. For
[3:12:40] the promise is unto you and to your
[3:12:42] children, and to all that are a far off,
[3:12:45] even as many as the Lord our God shall
[3:12:48] call.
[3:13:04] All
[3:13:22] &gt;&gt; true to
[3:13:23] Oh,
[3:13:29] you
[3:13:49] us.
[3:13:54] &gt;&gt; Where is joy? glorious
[3:14:16] Jesus Christ.
[3:14:26] A
[3:14:38] &gt;&gt; love
[3:14:48] true love.
[3:14:51] &gt;&gt; True love.
[3:15:09] We'll request our preacher that the Lord
[3:15:11] just to come and pray. God bless you.
[3:15:17] Let us pray.
[3:15:21] Dear heavenly father, once more Lord we
[3:15:24] are so grateful and thankful
[3:15:28] that you called yet another souls
[3:15:34] because the time is drawing near
[3:15:39] that we will be no more in this earth.
[3:15:41] Father,
[3:15:43] but you are calling one by one those
[3:15:47] that belong to you.
[3:15:49] Heavenly Father, it is a waterway.
[3:15:53] As we have seen before
[3:15:56] you went to Calvary, you also had to be
[3:15:59] baptized by John. Here the two father,
[3:16:02] they also take the same step of
[3:16:05] realizing
[3:16:08] that it is a waterway indeed.
[3:16:11] We ask father that uh from henceforth
[3:16:15] be with them. We know the devil he's not
[3:16:19] happy and he will come and entice them
[3:16:24] with the things of this world.
[3:16:27] We know that the things of this world
[3:16:29] look beautiful
[3:16:31] to a natural eye. But father give them
[3:16:34] the spiritual eye that they may
[3:16:37] appreciate you more than the world.
[3:16:40] Father, it's such a great price that we
[3:16:42] have paid and we are grateful that the
[3:16:45] young are coming.
[3:16:47] Father, we ask that you bless the
[3:16:50] service that has been rendered of
[3:16:52] baptism and father your children that
[3:16:56] came also just to be blessed by you
[3:16:59] through your word. Father h continue to
[3:17:04] be with us and guide us as we are
[3:17:07] pilgrims in this world. Really father we
[3:17:11] ask all these things knowing that you
[3:17:13] are the one that have overcome
[3:17:16] and you bought your church
[3:17:19] through your blood and father we are
[3:17:21] grateful to apply that blood and we we
[3:17:24] say apply it to the two souls as well.
[3:17:26] Heavenly Father, we ask all these things
[3:17:28] believing in the wonderful name of our
[3:17:30] Lord and Savior Jesus Christ with
[3:17:32] thanksgiving. Amen. And amen.
[3:17:52] willing.
