english me [Music] i [Music] amen [Music] [Music] baba [Music] we greet you in the name of our lord jesus christ of christ [Music] before we start reading the word i just wanted to give a testimony [Music] we are well protected here by the supernatural uh satan was trying to stop this uh [Music] the testimony is that we are worshiping god here successfully [Music] me before satan can stop this conference saturn has the power to stop god conference [Music] just after 12 o'clock midnight at 12 [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign now i have a daughter my granddaughter and my mother this is the people we know very [Music] foreign we started the battle there because i had to phone back home for a certain brother also battle with these spirits the people we know very well but now to your i i i don't think you'll be surprised if i say they worshipping mommy lodi [Music] is that god's worshippers and the devil worshippers so these people are not from any other church but from mommy lordy assembly one of them was caught i think it's a week ago or so forth she was caught early in the morning at our tabernacle there um [Music] this is a testimony for all of us firstly we caught up with seven of them and the brothers they gave me seven names of their witches family why i i bring this testimony it is because they were trying to stop this this i cannot elaborate on some of the things because of their sensitivity [Music] they were one two three four six people available to vassy we were trying to strangle my granddaughter last night [Music] to the reason is that they think that the pastor is not in south africa or in miami-lodi so we can attack [Music] i'm giving this testimony for us to rejoice over the victory that the lord has given us this testimony is not for you to fear i won't give you even last year it was the same thing [Music] so that we can all rejoice and know that we are safely dwelling in the house of the lord foreign and i know them we are like i say one of them is my clothes let me stop there now how should you swing in the game my [Music] amen [Music] [Music] satan himself mr [Music] [Music] [Music] watch the third pool [Music] i thought you'd salute god when they shall come against the bride [Music] [Music] when [Music] peter was supposed to look at him and as he looked at the one that was working upon the water hey this is wonderful now peter's problem was the belows he was thinking of many things the shacks [Music] but he said unto the lord if it's you walking up on the water very well now i'm sitting on whatever needs beating me to come to you now between peter and the lord jesus he [Music] he is actually putting you in the same mood meaning i'm working upon the sea [Music] some meters away from christ now i'm giving a testimony i'm talking to you beat me to come to you take away [Music] you can walk like me upon the sea let me hear your aiming to dance amen that's why we are here to serve god [Music] my granddaughter is there happily happily worshiping [Music] [Applause] we have won the battle last night he is my witness amen they took off the witches they were together with a young boy i know very well [Music] that's why the first thing in this morning in our hearts was to come to save him [Music] let's let's save him then some of these things i'm going to read a scripture here and we will have this subject here [Music] brother do i have my complete things here one issue is mine the one i worked on thank you sir all right we're going to look at this now the certificate the marriage certificate of the bride rewards [Music] was [Music] [Music] everything operates according to it to the law given to it there's a law of god for a young man there's a law of god for the marriage foreign [Music] [Music] foreign the variety the time of for the bride to go has come here will be looking into deep into these things concerning the bride and the growing the marriage of the bride because we have arrived at that time amen amen so we'll take things we'll take things according to their laws now that's why uh the the bride of christ now um she's actually in the pyramid of the angels god has deeply rooted into the interiority of the bride of christ arrived at the well he didn't try this subject in that subject and that's subjective for to rebecca casa [Music] well everybody is our friend [Music] i he was here last night i don't know today so let's read the word of god [Music] in jesus [Music] revelation chapter 20 the lord willing um [Music] heavenly father here we are again this morning lord god

father to be partakers of this wonderful oracles of god by your sons and daughters gathered here lord god and their presence here we know will pull all heaven down to this building because here father is a regathering of the sons and daughters of god as brother branham says this is not a gathering but a regathering because they were together there now they are supposed to be together here and

scripture to be read brother [Music] yeah i remember from here i can't see you with my eyes [Music] i have greeted you revelation 2011-15 and i saw a great white throne and him that sat on it from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away and there was found no place for them and i saw the dead small and great stand before god and the books were opened and another book was open which is the book of life and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books according to their works and the sea gave up the dead which were in it and the death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them and they were judged every man according to their words and death and hell were cast into the lake of fire this is the second death and whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire okay okay 2011-15 [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] god bless you you may be seated well there's so many books but we must find which of these books is our book um because the bible says our books are written in the lamb's book of life kids now this part of the the last part of this bible and is the seventh angel messenger in the garden of eden then he will pass the same thing on to adam [Music] is that's where you will find your seventh the mystery always is when god would pass on the ministry part of the ministry to a man [Music] in egypt the uh the deliverance foreign [Music] adam we headed here yesterday for just for two hours god and abraham so there always must be god and day [Music] even in eden there was no man to till the ground god has done this but there's no man to kill the ground meaning that in the program of god we are not removed there must be a manchester um is a mystery of god referring if you can worship god who is in that form then you can worship god it was [Music] a part of himself [Music] m a church without a shepherd is not the church every church [Music] a church which god has ordained [Music] the pastors don't feed yourself no the pastor will feed you friends have you ever seen a baby feeding himself those men are acquired in them have you ever seen a baby [Music] looking after itself [Music] oh no then we can continue brother says sheep cannot look after itself [Music] is a shepherd he must have sheep amen if god is a father then he must have children [Music] [Music] if if you don't have a shepherd don't call yourself sheep who's [Music] sheep can look after itself [Music] all right i saw a great white throne in him that sat on it from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away and there was found no more place for them [Music] you know like i told these witches [Music] you see we are struggling and so forth the mighty god knew all about it why didn't he kill satan before he brings troubles for us i said [Music] to demonstrate [Music] do you know that god always loves to demonstrate [Music] [Music] there were devils giants when god said to moses the angel of the lord shall go before thee go and take the land they were supposed to take [Music] he said you are going to fight the seven nations in order for you to occupy your position you fight and occupy allah hey church are you listening god just says moses and the occupied [Music] but it is not given to you on a train [Music] look at the nature of look at the nature of god jericho and god says to joshua joshua we always have to beat the devil to eat and take [Music] you've got to fight him off [Applause] god wants you to possess your health it was taken from you by the enemy the real real remedy is

they followed her and jesus was looking at her leading men and women coming after him assad [Music] now the first scenario is their natural light but when they arrive there go into the [Music] [Music] what [Music] [Music] [Music] before we start on this but let me repeat after the death of princess diana [Music] it was like a worldwide use and then i read out of a paper that they were people of the royal press something like that they also were called to interview diana's family family the news i said [Music] the newspaper the news according to the insiders then i jotted that on a [Music] [Music] and there is a message to the insiders amen you read your unveiling of god speaks about that the [Music] just look at each other god bless you my pastor amen you know we will used to sing abuser there is a big wheel turning in my heart there is a big wheel in my heart when we were at jeffersonville with a brother mercedes there we decided to go to the place where there was this cave the prophet's cave i think you have come across that day is it windmill yes brother speaks about the windmill [Music] [Music] and i preached to them and about the idea like that cloud and then the prophet says as he was in the midst of this pyramid of angels where did this angel come a cloud come from he says one day the angels left where he was standing [Music] told the disciples they're watching they were told that the same way you see him being taken up by now the bread of christ the same way he is taken up the same way he will return you see a cloud is included [Music] i read and i saw the dead let me go back to this one way [Music] and i saw the dead small and great stand before god and the books were opened and another book the book of which were [Music] [Music] [Music] judge us we'll read it out of the book to satisfy your test our body [Music] [Music] judges [Applause] there are some here you shall never taste of death they shall be raptured who are not going to judgment [Music] the judgment and were judged out of those things which were written in their books according to their works secretary [Music] and the sea gave up the dead which there's no hiding place amen amen there was a i gave a testimony well i i mean it's just a story to my brethren there was this work men who came i think was to fix what you call this a [Music] pastor caught up with that okay so i was speaking to him yeah he said something like i understand you are a pastor [Music] that's why i don't charge people for water for this and for them [Music] because today for to see a pasta you need to pay consultation or he won't speak why you are so quiet on this one are you selling to the people in the services now [Music] i won't be dead to be judged [Music] shall bring [Music] colleague of mine said about those who were eaten up by lions [Music] i said they waited [Music] and death and hell meaning which were in them [Music] is there any hiding place and they will judge just every man according to their works works both people the death and the death and hell were cast into the lake of fire and whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire yeah [Music] [Music] here i'm reading here page 65 65 works is faith expressed where's his faith expressed what is faith expressed [Music] when you get the book you are going to see maybe a little confusion there of what i said [Music] yes because you are a triune being and one will die the flesh will die [Music] out [Music] the name never can come off there because it was always on it which book is this which book is this [Music] all right those in the lamps book of life don't come to judgment but those in the book of life do come to judgment [Music] i'm going to call brother branham to explain himself now this book the name never can come from there because it was always on it that is the lamb's a brother said to me foreign [Applause] this one that remains in the field before the seat is taken away from the uh what do you call that stock experience everybody's free to enter that manga [Music] i mean they [Music] you watch after the rapture then it comes in just stop the stock remains even if the farmer sees a baboon there he doesn't worry about it because there's no seed [Music] [Music] is [Music] i've read it here the prophet spoke in the coming village the baptist what about believe that there's two separate books and in one way it is to separate books in two separate books [Music] [Music] because the stock is the bigger part [Music] you see the church ages [Music] look at the last part of it the seventh church age is not the first church age did you know that yes cannot be compared with the first church yes part of it is compared with poland [Music] is in a different way as it was when it was planted it is just one book one part is just a carrier it will vanish sounds like you can have your name taken off okay [Music] and that's where it is it's all in that great revelation which was made known during the time of the seven seals now we we are coming to to see now and it will be according to time and so because it will bring us to judgment we have this which the brothers will flash next time we will look at the judgment if you are not in the message church but if you are the word uh where will i stand or in switzerland in swaziland i will look at it i don't want to go beyond time said by my elders [Music] [Music] plural is nina you know abuser sometimes the sheep don't understand the shepherd they will even try to correct the shepherds never try to to to lead yourself [Music] [Music] you never try to lead your shepherds amen [Music] stay right behind your shepherd because [Music] i mean [Applause] some thought the pastor now is going [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] after the exams um [Music] you just stand next to the newspaper stand today you'll see the students coming in big numbers who has passed and who has dropped [Music] and one will just start now putting the paper in his bosom start jumping [Music] friends and running [Music] and singing [Music] um [Music] [Music] [Music] come here my brother amen [Music] [Music] [Music] [Laughter] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] yes [Music] [Music] jesus [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] yes [Music] [Applause]
