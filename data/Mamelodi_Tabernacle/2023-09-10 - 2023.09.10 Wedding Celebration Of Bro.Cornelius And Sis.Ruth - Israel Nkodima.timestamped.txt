[2:05:31] of the daughters of the Canaanites
[2:05:35] among whom I dwell
[2:05:37] but thou shall go unto my country
[2:05:43] uh because he was of the royal
[2:05:50] Thou shalt go unto my country and
[2:05:55] to my Kindred
[2:05:59] and take a wife
[2:06:03] and to my son
[2:06:06] so the wife wants to come through the
[2:06:10] life
[2:06:14] through the bloodline
[2:06:18] amen
[2:06:20] and now
[2:06:23] the same what God has done for
[2:06:29] the Bride of his son
[2:06:35] the bride should come through the
[2:06:38] bloodline
[2:06:42] that's why brother Branham says
[2:06:46] when Gabriel came to Mary
[2:06:48] [Music]
[2:06:50] am
[2:06:51] and said blessed are those
[2:06:55] the prophet of God says
[2:06:59] one marriage
[2:07:02] when the angel spoke to Maryam
[2:07:07] and when Mary accepted the word
[2:07:12] and said be it unto me according to the
[2:07:15] time
[2:07:17] [Music]
[2:07:19] according to the time of life
[2:07:24] so he says when Mary believes that word
[2:07:32] and believe the word that Gabriel spoke
[2:07:35] unto him
[2:07:38] that word became blood
[2:07:42] in the room of marriage
[2:07:46] because it it has to come through the
[2:07:49] bloodline
[2:07:52] just like the bride of Christ
[2:08:00] meaning that the rate that we have
[2:08:03] received
[2:08:05] it's actually the blood
[2:08:09] because when he spoke to Mary
[2:08:12] that very same way
[2:08:15] became
[2:08:17] in the womb of Mary
[2:08:20] then a son was born
[2:08:23] unto us
[2:08:26] amen amen meaning that the message that
[2:08:31] we believe
[2:08:32] and we have received
[2:08:36] has become blood
[2:08:38] in us
[2:08:40] now that blood that Mary that blood
[2:08:45] became
[2:08:53] it tends to be the way
[2:08:57] now just
[2:08:59] we see
[2:09:02] this messenger
[2:09:05] of God when he arrived there well
[2:09:13] that's where the women in the evening
[2:09:16] time would come for to collect water
[2:09:21] [Music]
[2:09:22] so the angel arrived in the evening
[2:09:28] for the bride
[2:09:32] and when she he arrived there
[2:09:36] his duties
[2:09:39] and
[2:09:41] expecting
[2:09:43] to see this young woman
[2:09:47] and it was in the evening time
[2:09:51] the evening time
[2:09:54] when women are
[2:09:56] she was not at her best
[2:10:01] because coming from work
[2:10:05] even in time
[2:10:06] this is the time when they will start
[2:10:09] the women start to be busy
[2:10:15] so that was the time that the angel
[2:10:18] arrived
[2:10:21] when
[2:10:22] Rebecca
[2:10:24] was not at her best
[2:10:28] I mean she took off whatever she had
[2:10:31] during the day I
[2:10:35] she remained with a character I'm
[2:10:38] talking about
[2:10:40] because the womb the angel was looking
[2:10:43] for a character
[2:10:46] not just a woman
[2:10:53] and that's why even our brother here
[2:10:58] when uh he was blessed
[2:11:03] and he was thinking of getting married
[2:11:08] he came to the right place
[2:11:15] the end time message
[2:11:17] to find a character
[2:11:30] he picked up a character
[2:11:33] foreign
[2:11:40] we have come to see
[2:11:43] a character
[2:11:45] that has picked up a character
[2:11:52] okay sorry
[2:12:00] he said to the messenger
[2:12:05] go and take
[2:12:07] Amanda
[2:12:09] he didn't say go and look for a for a
[2:12:12] wife
[2:12:14] but the wife was already there
[2:12:18] because he never said
[2:12:23] a girlfriend
[2:12:25] but go and find a wife
[2:12:29] because the wife was already
[2:12:33] and she was already there
[2:12:36] for the angel to come
[2:12:40] amongst the women
[2:12:45] now in the message
[2:12:48] it is like a sister in the message
[2:12:54] it's like a a woman
[2:12:58] [Music]
[2:13:01] where women come on
[2:13:04] to collect
[2:13:06] the word of God
[2:13:09] amen amen
[2:13:11] because you must first find the right
[2:13:13] place
[2:13:15] before you can
[2:13:19] take a wife
[2:13:22] you should first find the place
[2:13:29] that the wife for his son
[2:13:35] is somewhere in the evening time
[2:13:38] she was in the evening time
[2:13:49] only
[2:13:50] to find her too because she was already
[2:13:54] chosen
[2:13:56] Isaac's wife
[2:14:00] only the messenger was supposed to go
[2:14:03] and pick and the person
[2:14:07] to bring her to their husbands
[2:14:11] amen amen
[2:14:13] okay now we will see
[2:14:16] that later but I as we read in the Bible
[2:14:22] how the messenger went
[2:14:27] arriving at the world
[2:14:30] for a character
[2:14:33] and after finding this character
[2:14:37] he came with the character
[2:14:41] to her brothers
[2:14:46] he was just the home of this woman
[2:14:52] he spoke to the brothers
[2:15:00] and said to them
[2:15:02] he narrated to them how he met
[2:15:08] and after that
[2:15:11] he said to them
[2:15:15] now if you will deal currently
[2:15:19] and truly with my master
[2:15:25] tell me
[2:15:28] and if not
[2:15:30] tell me that I may turn to the right
[2:15:34] hand or to the left
[2:15:41] what happened is
[2:15:44] he narrated to them first
[2:15:47] and said behold
[2:15:50] when he arrived at the world he narrated
[2:15:54] to these brothers
[2:15:56] how he has found this their sister
[2:16:02] man
[2:16:07] because
[2:16:09] this woman also
[2:16:11] she saw Isaac
[2:16:14] in the evening time
[2:16:18] she was also picked up in the evening
[2:16:20] time
[2:16:22] to meet Isaac in the evening times
[2:16:32] now he said to the brothers
[2:16:39] now if you will deal kindly
[2:16:43] and truly with my master
[2:17:09] the thing proceedeth from the Lord
[2:17:16] marriage
[2:17:19] is from the Lord
[2:17:22] we cannot speak
[2:17:24] unto thee bad or Goods is
