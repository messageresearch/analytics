And then we're going to sing a song just to welcome the minister of the word. Amen. Jehovah It's a [singing] way [singing] [music] [singing] [music] [singing] [music] &gt;&gt; I see.

[laughter] So it is only the family that is speaking today. Amen. I didn't know that &gt;&gt; and to comfort ourselves. and to know the truth. &gt;&gt; For it says, "The truth shall set us free." &gt;&gt; I'm going to read the scripture in the book of Job. Job chapter 38 verse 17. My brother will read the scripture for us. My elder. Amen. You can read the scripture. Have the gates of death been opened unto thee? Or has thou seen the doors of the shadow of death? As we close our eyes, Amen. I told you I didn't talk with the aim, Lord Almighty, &gt;&gt; and the purpose, gracious Lord, the aim and purpose was that the being should ser you. So we are gathered here as a family, as neighbors, [music] as friends and even colleagues. We are so grateful Lord Almighty to serve a wonderful God. &gt;&gt; Father, here's my brother here and brother Tama standing before this congregation. to bring the voice of comfort. [music] &gt;&gt; I commit them unto thee, Lord Almighty. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I also commit the family unto thee that the word uttered today should find a place in their hearts &gt;&gt; and should be able to comfort them. Lord Almighty. Thank you, Father. May you anoint my brother here. May you anoint the ways that have been read. May you anoint also his voice, Lord. And may may you anoint also our ears and even our hearts. Gracious Lord. &gt;&gt; Thank you, [music] Father. We believe by all means that you will be the one that comforts us. In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, we pray. [music] Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. &gt;&gt; You may be seated. Uh before we go into our topic, I have few scriptures that I want to read for the family. We will all benefit. We have cameras here and we are streaming the funeral internationally. We have people streaming from Malawi. We have people streaming from Switzerland. We have people streaming from the USA. It is the reason why we are using two languages. And beside that, I'm from Ptoria Modi. Although my parents &gt;&gt; come from neighbor area but we have been spoiled by staying for quite a long time in pritoria. So our language is not pure. If I try to speak, I will also be adding some few tutorial languages. [snorts] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. So our title here is the gates of death. I want to put it as a question. Have the gates of death been opened unto thee? That means each and every individual sitting here, there will come a time where the gates of death will open unto thee. And when that gate open, you're going to tell us stories. Either you will give us a testimony or you will be crying or you will see strange things. But we have people that had a privilege that these gates were opened for them. The gates were open. But they came back to tell us what they saw. One of them the gate opened when he was 14 years old. And at the age of 55, he saw the people that he saw in hell. So when the gates of death opened unto him, he had the privilege at the age of 14 to go down to hell and he saw certain people there. And at the age of 54 when he was sitting at the mall, he saw the same people that he saw in her. up through the escalator. Meaning these people as the Bible says these are the one that were condemned to condemnation but we'll come back to that one. There are few scriptures I just want to read to the family and I want to start with Genesis 25. The Bible has wonderful scriptures. &gt;&gt; We also call it the love story. The Bible has all the answers. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Genesis 25:8. &gt;&gt; Abraham gave up the ghost and died in a good old age. Abraham, an old man, and full of years, and was gathered to his people. You know the Bible says &gt;&gt; he died in a good old age. &gt;&gt; So some people when they die, the Bible says they they die in a good old age. like our mother here, she died in a good old scripture, you know, when you read read the book of Luke, &gt;&gt; he talks about the beggar, he says when the beggar died, he was carried by angels to paradise. But now when we read this book here, &gt;&gt; Isaiah 46, &gt;&gt; Isaiah 46, &gt;&gt; verse four, &gt;&gt; verse four, &gt;&gt; it says something interesting about the old people. &gt;&gt; It says, "And even to your old age, I am he and even to &gt;&gt; Amen. Will I carry you? &gt;&gt; Can you read it in? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Isaiah 46. &gt;&gt; Isaiah 46:E4. I have made and I will bear. &gt;&gt; Even I will carry. and will deliver you. &gt;&gt; You know there's a scripture that says respect your mother and your father so that you can live long. So when you see a person living long then you remember that the scripture says respect your father, &gt;&gt; respect your mother so that you can live long. And if you live in Christ in your old age, when you die, it is him &gt;&gt; that will come and carry you and deliver you. You see in the Old Testament when God is pleased with your life [clears throat] when you die, the angels carried you. But if you are if God is pleased with you and you die in your old age while you please God, He come personally to carry you and deliver you. He doesn't send angels. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So, aren't we glad that our mother died in Christ and God himself had to come to carry him and deliver not the angels but God himself. Amen. Now, let's go to something else. &gt;&gt; I want us to go to the book of Psalms 90. verse 12 verse 12. Before I go into my topic, I just want to share with you few scriptures. My brother, if you can read Bisalum 90 verse12, The Bible says the first wisdom is to fear God. &gt;&gt; Now it say teach us &gt;&gt; to number our days that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom. So the only way that we can apply our hearts Only if we fear God, then God will teach us to number our days. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So we have to number our days. But only God can teach us to number our days. Amen. Let's read another scripture here. Ecclesians Ecclesians chapter 9:12 9:12 if my brother can find it says in my book here for man also knoweth not his time. So you don't know &gt;&gt; the time that God will call you home. &gt;&gt; So you cannot postpone the day of your salvation because you don't know your time. For man also knoweth not his time. The only thing we can ask him to teach us to number our days. [snorts] &gt;&gt; But we don't know when we will be called. Amen. &gt;&gt; So that's why we have to repent &gt;&gt; and live for Christ. Let's go to the book of Job. Again, &gt;&gt; I want us to just lay a foundation here. Now chapter 7 verse one it says &gt;&gt; Job 7 verse one &gt;&gt; is there not an appointed time to men upon the earth. &gt;&gt; Is there not an appointed time to men upon the earth? So that means each and every one of us has an appointment. And it says are not his days also like the days of a hiring. You see when when you get a job, you are hired and they give you a job description and they give you an appointed time. So when God brought us here to the earth, he actually hired us &gt;&gt; and gave us an appointed time and we were hired to be the written apostles. So when God brought you here, he gave you a job description and he gave you an appointed time. &gt;&gt; So your job description is to serve him. Hallelujah. If you do other things, that is not why you are here on the earth. He brought you here, &gt;&gt; appointed you here for a specific time. Amen. &gt;&gt; So, we are saving his time. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, let's go back to our topic. Job uh 38. Job 38 verse 7. Verse 17. Yes. Thank you. Can you read it again, my brother? Amen. Amen. Have the gates of death been opened unto thee? I have a servant of God here. And he says he was privileged &gt;&gt; to saw both places. You see the the book of Ephesians says when a man die the spirit goes back to God. who gave you. &gt;&gt; Now, a person is a a threefold being. &gt;&gt; You are a body, &gt;&gt; a spirit, &gt;&gt; and a soul. Now, when you die, the body goes back to the dust, the spirit, goes back to God. If you served him well where the soul goes under the altar if you saved him well. If God was pleased with your life. Now we talk about the souls under the altar. Now the altar is in the presence of the almighty God. It is in the sixth dimension. But if you did not serve him, well, you go to a prison house. Now that prison house is also called hell. So when a when the gates of death opens, you either see you will see your destination. When that gate open, it's either you will see the sixth dimension or you will see the prison house which is hell. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now we will touch the issue of the resurrection. &gt;&gt; Now a man of God says here The prophet says, "I was privileged to see both places when that gate opened." And he says, "I've been in both places." &gt;&gt; He was in hell. He saw it &gt;&gt; and he was translated &gt;&gt; into the sixth dimension and he saw it. Now when he went to hell, he was traumatized. He says, "I was privileged. I've been in both places and I seen the redeemed in the sixth dimension. I have seen the lost in hell where they were and I stand here as your brother today warn you to flee from the downward path. So he is saying don't never go that way. Don't never go down to hell. When you read the book of Luke, when the rich man died, he went to hell and he was tormented to an extent that he said Lazarus Lazarus &gt;&gt; just to deep. He just wanted a taste of wood because in hell is torment after torment. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So he says don't ever go that route. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Far be it from any person to enter the region of the Lord. If you were standing with hot wires, bought through you, tormented in every way, it will not even be like the torment down. He he says if you are standing &gt;&gt; with hot wires wired through your body and tormented that is nothing compared to that's why he says don't is very horrible. Don't never go towards that region. You can't even take a picture of her being that bad. And whatever you do, don't never go to the rich of the Lord. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he says, When he was 14 years old, he was privileged to go to that region of the lost and he saw people there. 54 years after he saw those people here on the earth, same people that he saw in heaven. Meaning these people they are here on the earth. They are born here on the earth but they are represented in hell. &gt;&gt; So this these people the book of Jude says &gt;&gt; they will never repent. They are born to condemnation just like Judas. You see Judas was a disciple of the Lord Jesus Christ &gt;&gt; but he was born a son of pedition. So while he was with the Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord Jesus was saying this one it was better if he was not there. because his representation was in her. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So when you have a privilege to receive the salvation that is the way to go and it says the day of salvation is today. The day of salvation is now. Amen. Amen. Now the same prophet says I was privileged to see both sides. First he saw he saw the region of the lost and he says don't ever go that way. Then he says the other day I was laying on my bed. Then the voice asked, &gt;&gt; "Will you like to see just beyond the curtain of time?" So when he was 14 years old, he was privileged to see downward. But later in his years he was privileged and he was taken beyond the K. You see Job asked a question if a man died? Where will he be? What happens? Is he going to be a myth? Is he going somewhere? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But Job didn't have an answer. And the prophet come and says I was privileged. A voice asked would you like to see just beyond the cinema. So he was translated to the sixth dimension just to go over the altar. What happened? I cannot say whether I was in the body or out of the body or whether it was a translation. I do not know. &gt;&gt; But when I was translated beyond the curtain of time, there were great numbers of people and they came running to grief. You see, when he went down to hell, nobody came to greet him because everybody was in command. Your family cannot welcome you. They in down there, your friend down there in so there's no way that they can come and greet you. They are just screaming and shouting. And there's no God there. But when you are went beyond the c of time, he was welcomed. &gt;&gt; You see, that's why when you read the book of Genesis, it says Abraham, &gt;&gt; Abraham, &gt;&gt; Abraham, &gt;&gt; Abraham &gt;&gt; was gathered with his people. That means the place that Abraham went, he was welcome. That means it was a peaceful place. But down there, there's no welcoming. He just torment. But beyond the curtain of time, he says, "A great number of people, they came running to greet me and saying, our precious brother and they were young and he says they were in their brilliance of their youth." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I noticed that I too have come here. You see down there you can never know whether they young or old they are crying down there &gt;&gt; but up there &gt;&gt; they are young. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And when you arrive there &gt;&gt; you are welcomed. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now let's read because we are talking about the gates of death. You know those people that had a privilege to be close to the people that are dying, they will tell you stories. Now let's look at Dr. Bosworth. Dr. Bosworth. When I heard that he was going to meet the Lord, I went to see him and I said, "Brother Bossworth, &gt;&gt; are you going to get well?" And he said, "I'm just going home." When was your happiest time in life, brother? See, Dr. Bosworth was a very old man. So the prophet asked him, "When was your happiest time in life?" His happiest time was when the gates of death opened. And he said, "Right now, you see, he said that the prophet said, "Brother Bos, do you know that you are dying?" Brother, he said I can't die. You see a Christian do not die. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He says I died many years ago. &gt;&gt; I'm watching for him to open that door at any time and come and get me. Amen. &gt;&gt; He's not waiting for angels. &gt;&gt; He was waiting for him &gt;&gt; to carry him and deliver him to the sixth dimension. So his happiest time, he was just waiting and watching for him open the door. Hallelujah. to come and get him to be gathered by his people before he died or before he went to glory about an hour before &gt;&gt; he started. Let me read this. He had been kind of asleep for a few hours and his wife, his sons, standing around. An old man woke up. When that gate opened, he woke up, looked around, raised up, and ran across the floor, and shook hands with his mother, who had been gone for many years, with his father, for over an hour. He shook hands with people. Oh, this is brother John. He came to Christ in my meeting. Oh, this is brother so and so thanks with his converts that has passed on for many years. I know of an old woman. Um this woman [clears throat] always &gt;&gt; when they are sitting and he will just be pointing at the people that he himself can see but the other people cannot see. And he will be saying You so and so &gt;&gt; don't come here. So and so don't come here. &gt;&gt; Calling dead people and people can see that she's scared. She has no peace. The only thing that she needs is to repent before it's too late. Amen. Let's read another one here. &gt;&gt; Abraham Lincoln. &gt;&gt; Abraham Lincoln when he was dying he was short. He was the president of the United States and he was a Christian. on his time of death. When he was dying in his bed, he said, "Turn my face towards the setting of the sun. The sun was going down and Abraham Lincoln was breathing and the blood gougling in his lungs. He had trusted God all his life. He said, "Hold up my hand." And he held his hand. So I started praying. Our father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name as he bowed his head and gave us the ghost. Yeah. &gt;&gt; So when when the gate of death opened, &gt;&gt; the first thing that came was the Lord's prayer. Now Dr. Moodi &gt;&gt; at his death, he said, &gt;&gt; "This is my coronation day." Paul, &gt;&gt; the one that wrote the song Only Believe, all things. &gt;&gt; When he was on his deathbed, &gt;&gt; he looked and raised his head and he looked at the people in the he shook his head and said, "Who is dying?" You know the people have this tendency when a person is about to pass away. You know, even the way they walk, you know, the way they they respect the dead, they respect, you know, they go like this. &gt;&gt; They referencing themselves. &gt;&gt; Even the people that hated the one, &gt;&gt; they go like that. So they were doing that to Paul. Then he asked them a question. Who is dying here? Is it me or is it? &gt;&gt; They said then he said race cuz they said let us close the gate. He said no no no no no the best thing you can do is for you to sing me the resurrection. Amen. &gt;&gt; Then few minutes, 5 minutes before he died, &gt;&gt; he said to them, "Think of it. In the next 5 minutes, I will be standing in the presence of the Lord Jesus." While they were trying to close the gates, then he said, "Think of it. In the next few minutes, I'll be standing in his presence. You know the prophet Paul &gt;&gt; when he was ready to die, you know, they were fixing to chop off his head. So he was ready to die and he started saying, "Oh grave, where is thy victory? Death, where is thy state?" In other words, death, you are coming. You are trying to scare me, but you can scare me. The grave said, "I can hold you." The grave telling Paul, "I can hold you." And Paul looked at it, "You can't do it. For here in Jerusalem, there's an empty tomb. You fail to hold the Lord Jesus. How can you hold him? I've got the power to raise this boy. You can't hold me death. Where is your sting in this hour? When he's about to die, he was even undermining death. Where is your stay? Where is your victory? You are saying, "Oh, death." You know, you are the last enemy to be destroyed. You can't even hold me. You are nothing. in his hour of death. &gt;&gt; He said, "I'm not afraid to die grave. Show me your victory." &gt;&gt; Because he heard the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Now, let's look at the testimony of those that did not have Christ in their heart. There was an infidel by the name of Bobinger Soul. &gt;&gt; He used to boost around and say there's no God. He was popular around the television. But when that gate of death opened, he was in the hospital room. He screamed, "Oh God, have mercy on my soul." Hallelujah. There was another infidel, he also boosted and cast, saying, "There's no God." In his hour of death, when the gates of death opened, he screamed and cried and says, "Yo, I see devils. I see chains wrapped around him." He said, "They coming after me until he even said to his children, &gt;&gt; don't go the way of your father. Go the way of your mind because he has accepted Christ. He was baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Even the great queens of England when when they were stepping out into death, &gt;&gt; they were screaming. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. M &gt;&gt; until one said, &gt;&gt; "If I can have five more minutes just to repent, but it was too late." Oneist who didn't believe in God, when that hour came, he started screaming, "I see two walls. And when I scream, it just echo from wall to wall. Because he kept postponing salvation. It's been the fear of men all throughout the ages. Death. Amen. Even the great scientist, even the doctors, they can't solve that problem. Death, they are all scared. Let me read the last scripture here. Then we will be living. Revelation chapter 20 verse 6. Blessed and holy is he that has pardoned the first resurrection. On such the second death have no power. You see this we call it the first death is separation from your loved ones. But death means separation from your loved ones. And if you die and you go into the sixth dimension, then you will come up in the first resurrection. So our mama, the second death has no power. So if you fear the first death, how much more about the second death? Because with the first death, you can come up in the first resurrection. If you are a Christian, you see if you love someone, you want them to come up in the first result, when you love someone, it's not to buy them a present. Somebody said, "Oh, this brother love his daughter, love his son, even bought him a car." That's very good. Actually, as parents, we must provide. But love is to convert to Christianity because that one will come in the first resurrection and the second death will not have power. Now let's go to verse 14. Verse 14 uh let's start from verse 12 verse 11. &gt;&gt; Amen. And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on it from, okay, uh, let's go to verse 12. And I saw the dead, small and great, stand before God. See these ones, they came in the second resurrection. You see the one that come in the first resurrection, they are the one that are judging these ones that are coming before the throne. And when they refer to them, they say they are the dead. That means they don't have hope. whether he's a president or whether he was a a pope. That's why the Bible says great and small before God and the books were open and another book was opened the book of life &gt;&gt; and the dead. &gt;&gt; You see the people that goes to the white throne judgment. The Bible don't even call them people. It calls them the dead. Imagine the Bible referring to a person coming before the white throne judgment. How are you the dead? You see they are referred to as the dead. So don't come to the white throne judgment because when you come to the white throne judgment your neighbor will be referring to you. You think here on earth he was respecting you as an honorable member of parliament honorable so when it comes to the judgment he will call you the dead that honorable thing gone that title of a doctor gone you refer to as the deadual Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And the dead were judged out of those things which were &gt;&gt; and the sea. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the sea &gt;&gt; gave up the dead which were in it and death itself and hell delivered up the dead. You see when you die without Christ, you go to hell. In the room judgment, remember hell is a prison house. It brings you, it brings you to the w judgment. Even hell come with respect. He says, Lord Almighty here the day. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Even death itself, even the sea, it brings their death here the day. They are called the dead, not people. You see, here on earth, we respect everyone. We call you brother, sister. You know, we call you with wonderful names. We respect you. But when it comes to the white throne judgment, if you come before God at the white throne judgment, no respect. There's no brother dead, &gt;&gt; just the dead. &gt;&gt; Let's read the last verse here and death and hell were cast into the lake of fire. This is the second death. He said that prison house that we call hell after the white throne judgment, it is thrown into the lake of fire. So it's no longer hell. It goes into the lake of fire. It goes into the lake of fire. And whosoever was not found written in the book of life broadcast of Hallelujah. Let me stop here. He say in the resurrection &gt;&gt; the Bible says the spirit will be released from God. You see when you died as a Christian the spirit goes back to God. The body goes to the grave. And the soul goes under the sixth dimension. Now in the resurrection, the spirit is released from God. You see the great teacher says when you die and the Bible says so the spirit goes back to God. You see when the prophet went beyond the curtain of he said I want to see Jesus and they said he's a little bit high meaning he's in the seventh dimension and he says when you die the spirit goes back to God meaning your spirit goes to the seventh dimension. So in the resurrection he says God will release that spirit from the seventh dimension. Then it goes to the sixth dimension to pick up the soul. Then it comes here to the earth to pick up the substance. We should live in. That means we are not going to throw away the board. We are going to lay down because the owner of this boat is a young person. He's a young woman in the sixth dimension. He's going to come back and he's going to collect the substance that he will be in a glorified. You see this body is called the terrestrial body. In the resurrection, the spirit picks up the soul. Then the soul comes and pick up the substance. Now it will resurrect as a glorified body. And it says during the first resurrection, they will appear unto men. They will appear unto men. The people that know our mother, they will see her, but she will be a young woman. So family, if you have a photo of our mother at the age of 20, put it safe because in the resurrection, she will come in a glorified glorified body as a young woman at the age of 20. And she will appear unto men for 40 days before we are also changed. and we are going to be with the Lord forever. And in in the white throne judgment, she will be calling others that didn't believe the word of God. How are you today? God bless you. Let us all repent. May the Lord richly bless you as we stand on our feet. I did go beyond my time. Please forgive me. Let us ask our elder here just to come forth and say a word of prayer. God bless you.
