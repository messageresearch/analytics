[1:43:31] you
[1:43:34] is that one matthew's chapter 16 verse
[1:43:37] 13 to 19
[1:43:39] i i have a brother here i don't know if
[1:43:41] he's ready with his bible okay
[1:43:44] god bless you tuna when jesus came into
[1:43:47] the coast of caesarea philippi which is
[1:43:57] may i ask from the pastor whether we
[1:44:00] should read in our
[1:44:02] language vernacular or
[1:44:04] in english well the pastor says it's
[1:44:07] fine
[1:44:08] verse 14
[1:44:10] and they said
[1:44:21] [Music]
[1:45:13] all
[1:45:14] right here we are
[1:45:19] it's a question
[1:45:21] who do men say that i'm the son of men
[1:45:28] here
[1:45:56] the question is
[1:45:58] the son of man
[1:46:02] the answer is
[1:46:05] the son of
[1:46:07] the leading god
[1:46:23] amen
[1:46:24] and when he was the son of man
[1:46:29] he will look into it he was not when he
[1:46:32] was with them
[1:46:38] that's what he called himself
[1:46:42] and
[1:46:43] he was not a mediator as the son of man
[1:46:47] being with them obeying us
[1:46:52] and you
[1:47:03] and he now changed from being the son of
[1:47:06] man to the son of god
[1:47:13] we will realize as the son of god he
[1:47:16] becomes a mediator of the new testament
[1:47:32] now these things
[1:47:42] because in the book christ is the
[1:47:44] mystery of god and what in christ is the
[1:47:47] mystery of god
[1:47:48] in prophetic
[1:49:16] [Music]
[1:49:26] elijah called elijah elijah is elisha
[1:49:30] and he he also started to walk
[1:49:35] towards the chariot
[1:49:38] amen
[1:49:53] as the
[1:50:09] and i think you have also noticed
[1:50:15] that
[1:50:16] we are living with one
[1:50:18] church
[1:50:20] each year
[1:50:21] c
[1:50:22] church
[1:50:49] they are in the sixth dimension
[1:50:54] one's remaining
[1:50:57] she said as the bible puts it
[1:51:02] and we that are alive it says it

[1:51:14] we are the last church age we're going
[1:51:17] to see bandana
[1:51:30] ages

[1:53:51] church age

[2:02:06] something here any painting because it
[2:02:09] is like this with god
[2:02:12] even men don't know this
[2:02:16] the first
[2:02:31] sign abraham
[2:02:33] and this is the last sign
[2:02:35] was jehovah talking to them in the form
[2:02:38] of amen
[2:02:41] because the first sign
[2:03:12] let
[2:03:34] finally when god was
[2:03:36] creating like
[2:03:38] like in an evolution but not evolution
[2:03:46] complete creation
[2:03:50] god bless
[2:04:08] he creates or whatever god

[2:04:30] finally
[2:04:32] amen
[2:04:35] they came forth upon the earth and
[2:04:38] perfection
[2:04:42] you know if you are a christian
[2:04:44] you are always looking for perfection
[2:04:48] the bible says be therefore perfect
[2:04:53] for your father in heaven perfect
[2:04:58] that's why we always want to be perfect
[2:05:04] we don't want to be like somebody else
[2:05:06] also so but we want that
[2:05:09] god
[2:05:13] now yes
[2:05:17] man of god
[2:05:46] the reason
[2:05:58] she has now become a yellow bone
[2:06:18] all those things
[2:06:20] are men
[2:06:21] now they
[2:06:23] appear under

[2:06:27] youtube marcos
[2:06:52] foreign

[2:07:31] [Applause]
[2:07:39] we the reason we left the sin
[2:07:42] naked
[2:07:44] it is because we are predestinated
[2:07:51] that's the reason we left sin younger
[2:07:55] the reason we left hairstyles
[2:07:57] this is that to search
[2:08:01] and sound
[2:08:02] because we are predestinated
[2:08:20] the styles
[2:08:35] that's what i want to be like the ego
[2:08:37] logo is the following like jesus who
[2:08:39] would you say no jesus all right now you
