[11:25] better all what is in store in heaven
[11:28] heaven father you've brought us and put
[11:32] them into our
[11:34] heart Heavenly Father we want to thank
[11:36] you for opening our eyes and stand where
[11:41] Abraham stood and when he met
[11:46] me Lord God you put him in a position
[11:50] where he can see Sodom and gorra burning
[11:53] we found ourself in the same position
[11:55] because the world is

[12:00] done anything good before thee Lord it
[12:03] is because you loved us amen We

[12:17] putting us up in the mountain like Peter
[12:20] John and James we thank you Lord God for
[12:23] hearing when our pastor was telling us

[13:16] what you have done unto us before there
[13:18] was even an atom we love you so much
[13:22] because you first loved us and there's
[13:24] nothing that we can do heavenly father
[13:26] to please the world but is to look up
[13:28] upon thee heavenly father because to
[13:31] begin with we were the children of God
[13:34] father God we appreciate you once more
