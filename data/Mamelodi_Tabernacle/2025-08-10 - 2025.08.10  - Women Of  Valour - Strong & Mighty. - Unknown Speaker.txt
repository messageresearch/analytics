The saints under the altar, Lord God Almighty, are waiting to meet us once again &gt;&gt; so that we can together put on our glorified bodies, Lord God. &gt;&gt; Heavenly Father, until that day comes, help us this morning. &gt;&gt; If there's any sin in our midst, &gt;&gt; Lord God Almighty, you said the blood is here to cleanse us. Amen. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Father God, for your faithfulness. Our deacon and my brother Tamaka are standing before the church this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; These men are going to be the mouthpiece of the most high God. &gt;&gt; God, &gt;&gt; we pray that the anointing of the locus &gt;&gt; will cover them, Lord God Almighty. &gt;&gt; Amen. We pray that the anointing of the locus will anoint the body this morning so that heavenly father your presence will be manifested once again. Thank you father. We give you praise and honor in the glorious name of our lord and savior Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Open our bible. In the book of Genesis chapter 16 &gt;&gt; in the book of Genesis chapter 16 &gt;&gt; from verse one to four. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Genesis 16 from verse one. Now Sarai Abraham's wife bare him no children and she had an husband an handmade an Egyptian whose name was Haga. And Sar Sarai said unto Abraham, Behold now the Lord hath restrained me from bearing. I pray thee, go in unto my mate. It may be that I may obtain children by her. And Abraham heckened to the voice of Sarai. And Sarai, Abraham's wife, took Haga, her maid, the Egyptian, after Abraham had dwelt. 10 years in the land of Canaan, and gave her to her husband Abraham to be his wife. And he went in unto Haga, and she conceived. And when she saw that she had conceived, her mistress was despised in her eyes. &gt;&gt; Amen. Uh we may be seated. [Music] Just a greeting from the pastor once more. &gt;&gt; He is more than fine. &gt;&gt; Amen. I took a long walk with him on Friday on the banks of the river. So, we're just sharing. &gt;&gt; So, I just want to let you know that all is well. We want to thank God for your prayers. Amen. Amen. And uh happy women's day to our sisters. &gt;&gt; Amen. [Applause] So the previous messages we preached, we were focusing on the simultaneous occurrences. Then we were talking about the millennium. I wanted to continue with the message this morning. But I think I said to you previously that when you are on a journey, you sometimes stop for refreshment and come back to the journey again. So when I was still continue with the same message then I decided God gave me the guidance to take a refreshment because it's the month of the women. I said let me just comfort them and give them more strength and talk about the message that is pertainth unto them. So this morning we will talk about women of valor. Amen. The strong and mighty women of God. That is the message for this morning as we are in the journey. Be not discouraged. We are in a journey. We will get there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; As I was asking our brother to pray for us, I was just thinking about him the previous night and how we went to and baptized many people. You see, it's not big in structure. But when he baptized is like they are too light in his hands all the people we baptiz in for from our brother here. So I always honor him. Amen. And I want to tell you that the the message will is going all over after service when when you are sleeping. He took this message. He took this he take this message and write it. He will write and send the children of God in. So h when I think about my brother, I can't hold myself. &gt;&gt; Sometimes we need to appreciate one another. We need one another. If you are a loner, you won't make it in life. One day, you will need us. Don't try to make yourself something. just be a son and a daughter of David. Brother Brenham was a prophet, &gt;&gt; but he will say to the church, pray for me as I pray for you. Let's pray for one another. Amen. Amen. That is why this message is about the women in the Bible that stood the test of time about the women this morning that are standing for the word of God. Be not discouraged. Amen. Amen. where we just read now we found Sar being the wife to Abraham and the Bible here saying &gt;&gt; they didn't have children. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then Sarah said to Abraham, you can take Hag to have kids for us. But remember, God said to Abraham, "You shall have a son." But they wanted to do it their own way, Sarah took it upon herself. And she said to Abraham, "Get hag and have kids." Amen. Amen. So Abraham accepted the offer they took and they have a son by the name of Ishmael. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So you know in life if someone can realize that he has something that others do not have they start to be pompous because her was respecting Sara. all along. But the day she realized she has what Sah doesn't have, &gt;&gt; she started to disrespect. It's true. &gt;&gt; I can make you something today, but you will despise me tomorrow. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Until when we meet in the mall somewhere, You won't even recognize some brother now. You will just say you look familiar. It seems like we met somewhere. That's when you realize you don't need me anymore. I'm no longer in your mind. I start to look familiar. So h make the same mistake. After she conceived, she was no longer walking humbly. She know she started to walk like this having some talks like, "Hey, this stomach, hey, this pain." Deliberate deliberately went before Sarah to show her The sun is coming. &gt;&gt; You are nothing. &gt;&gt; People are just people. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Then Sarah &gt;&gt; was not happy. &gt;&gt; She didn't know that this will happen. Then she started, you know, to talk to Abraham. I I don't like the way Hag is walking before me. I don't like the way she talks to me. Then Abraham innocently will say, "No, no problem. But there is a problem." Amen. Then even if there's no birth pain when when hag see you just say it seems like the birth pains are coming. Yeah, she was doing that until one day when Abraham was was sleeping. Sarah did not sleep was just looking at Abraham. &gt;&gt; Midnight when Abraham opened the eyes. She saw Sarah looking at she was like, "What are you trying to do?" Amen. &gt;&gt; Then Sarah will just say, "No, I like your beard. about the beard. Something is happening. Sarah is not happy about Abraham will just sleep and say, "Oh, she love my is deeper than you thought." Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So she bear a child. After the child was there, the child was just like his mom. Okay? &gt;&gt; Because children can take after the other one takes after the other one, the other takes. But the child was just like his disrespectful. Then Sarah said, "Come what may, &gt;&gt; I won't take it anymore." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We can read &gt;&gt; chapter 20. &gt;&gt; Chapter 20 verse 9 to 14. You can read it for us. Then Abel called Abraham. &gt;&gt; No, no. Is it verse 9? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Kenya chapter 20. &gt;&gt; Verse 9. &gt;&gt; Oh, verse chapter 21. &gt;&gt; Chapter 21. &gt;&gt; 21 verse 9. I'm sorry. &gt;&gt; Verse 9. &gt;&gt; 14. &gt;&gt; And Sarah saw the son of Haga the Egyptian which he had born unto Abraham. Moi. &gt;&gt; Yeah. You see, &gt;&gt; wherefore she said unto Abraham, "Cast out his bond woman and her son, &gt;&gt; for the son of this bond woman shall not bear her with my son, even with Isaac." &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And the thing was very grievious in Abraham's sight because of his son. And God said unto Abraham, "Let it not be grievious in thy sight, because of the lead, and because of thy bond woman, in all that Sarah hath said unto thee, he haken unto her voice. For in Isaac shall thy seed be called, and also of the son of the bond woman will I make a nation, because he is thy seed." And Abraham rose up early in the morning and took bread and a bottle of water and gave it unto Haga, putting it on her shoulder and the child and sent her away. And she departed and wandered in the wilderness of Basha. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The son of Hag &gt;&gt; being Ishmael &gt;&gt; started at home. You know, &gt;&gt; the child of a snake comes with a poison already. He just followed the footstep of his mom who started mocking &gt;&gt; Isaac and Sarah. Then after that, Sarah saw it. She was very much observant because she realized things are no longer the same anymore. Then she said to Abraham, Abraham. &gt;&gt; Now Abraham, this woman and her son must leave. And the Bible says it was not easy to swallow because Ishmael was the son of Abraham. And Isaac was the son of Sarah &gt;&gt; and Abraham as well. But now it becomes two families in one house. Sarah said, "I cannot stay with them. Get rid of them. You do it. If you don't do it, I will do it." The woman that stood the test of time stand for what she believed in said to her husband, "They must leave." You know, Abraham was standing there. Maybe he went to the field and come back, go to the sheep and come back trying to talk to God, hitting himself very hard. But Sarah was just looking at him. Do whatever you want. But this one must go. Hey, the women are powerful. Don't undermine them. They can make you great and they make they can make you nothing. You cannot make a mistake. We are who we are because of our women. &gt;&gt; So is the women's month is amen. &gt;&gt; So now Sarah said to Abraham they will leave irrespective of any condition of your explanation they are not going to stay with us. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And when Abraham was crying there, givers and so forth, God descended and said to him, Abraham, listen to your wife. There are many men who can't be controlled by a woman. Hey, they are single today. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because Abraham &gt;&gt; stood there am I then God said listen to your let them go. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Abraham, he said, if God said it, I don't have a leg to stand on. I must just make a plan. They must go for the sake of peace in the house. And they went. He gave them water, everything, and they go. When they were going, Abra, God said to Abraham, "There will be a nation from that boy." meaning don't worry they can go in the wilderness but the angel of God will protect them. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We need women today that stand for what they believe. Let me read what the brother Brennham says. Question answers. They were asking him question. She said the Ishmael children, &gt;&gt; the Ishmael children are the sons of Abraham &gt;&gt; out of heart. They believe in true Jehovah God. But the only thing that they miss is when they say Jesus is just one of the prophet. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. But they are through and comedants and the at the grave of Muhammad. &gt;&gt; You should go look striking the the great tomb there and for thousand years there's been a white horse settled standing there. Muhammad promised that he will rise from the dead someday and he will jump on that horse and conquer the the world. And every moment they just change one horse from another waiting there with faithful God standing waiting for the Muhammad to rush from there 2,000 years since then. Amen. Amen. They they believe that and it's not working for them. That was the lineage of Ishmael. That was the lineage of Ishmael believe in the true God. But they didn't have the original promise. The original promise was through the lineage of Esau. That's why through the lineage of Isaac, we see the Lord Jesus Christ who died put in the tomb on the third day he rise. This one for thousand years, he couldn't rise. It shows who has the promise. The original promise from God was the lineage of Isaac. &gt;&gt; Who stood for that? A woman by the name of Sarah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said to Abraham, "How can two walk together both agree? I do not agree with her. Ishmael will not agree with Israel. So we must go separate way. When we go separate way, we will see their fruits. They shall see. And we see the fruits of the decision of Sarah today. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So as I always say, just wait upon the Lord. Our God has done a complete job. Because one day he visited Rebecca. You know when the angel of God comes always to a mama because the mama is the one that told the kids to see the child for the first time and the prophecy will be from the mom the kids. That is why Rebecca had twins Jacob and Isel. But the angel of God said to Rebecca, "You will have twins, but there is two nations in your womb." And the angel of God said to Rebecca, "I love Jacob and hate Esau." &gt;&gt; Before they were even born, that is why when they were born, &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Rebecca was protecting Jacob because he had a secret that Isaac doesn't have. And the Bible says Isaac loved Esau because Esau was a gentle man. He was a hand. He He was a good man through the eyes of the world. But Rebecca the mama had a secret that the one that will inherit is the second [Music] I read Israel and the church God raised up Pharaoh and hardened his heart for a purpose. &gt;&gt; If your heart is hardened this morning, It was hardened by God by the purpose. You have a certain purpose you need to fulfill and that purpose need a hard heart. [Music] God raised up Judas's scariot. He was born. He had a son of Petition. Is that right? &gt;&gt; Judas wanted to go to heaven. He was a good treasurer. He He was a good man. But he was a son of people. His destination was in hell. God did that. You are not here this morning because you understand message. You are here this morning because God loves you. Reveal the message to your heart. Don't be pompous and think you know bad you don't know. Let the one that know rule your heart. [Applause] &gt;&gt; God taught Esau and Jacob before they was ever born told his mother all about what's going to take place. One he hated the other one he had loved. Is that true? So God who does all things in all things and you have nothing to do with it, you have nothing to do. Amen. And if God has called you, the love of God is ringing in your heart, brothers and sisters, is God who does that, not you. [Music] and all that he has called &gt;&gt; will come to you and none of it be lost. God's promise, he said, none of them shall be lost. Amen. Amen. The people that have business, that run business, they have these things. When you run a business, you must really push and push harder for you to be at a certain level. Whether in a good way or a bad way, that's a business language. If you need to kill, kill and have money. That's a business language. Not with the word of God. In the word of God, none will be lost. God has done it all. Relax in the word of God because God has done it all. All the father has given me will come to me and none of them is lost. Judas is that the scripture might be fulfilled and I will raise them up at the last days. In the word of God, you don't push. You don't push hard, but you wait upon the way and God will do everything for you. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; There are certain things in life. They not they don't need long prayers. They don't need overnight prayers. They don't need fasting. You just need to be in the way. And everything you are doing, God is doing it in you until when you speak is God speaking. When you walk, it's God walking. if it happened that you backslide. It's not a an incident. But it's what God knew. &gt;&gt; Judas never wanted to backslide. He wanted to be in the will of God, but he was born to be damned. No one can change him. No one can change that. That was the will of God. He was predestinated for it. &gt;&gt; So the secret was with Rebecca. &gt;&gt; The secret is with women. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; The women of the old God spoke to them. And God said to Rebecca, "You will have two children, two sons. I love this one. I hate this one. Then was leaving behind Jacob. Amen. Because is the one that God loves. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; But Isaac when he comes home, he will look for Esau. &gt;&gt; Where is my meat? &gt;&gt; You make it nice. &gt;&gt; Amen. is is us men. &gt;&gt; If we eat, we forget the process. &gt;&gt; But women, &gt;&gt; they are focusing on what God told them. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; You see men, they are attracted by this chicken dust. Hey, more especially in there too many. When I look at all the locations has got many chicken dust, there's a cow head. [Music] The men go home with full stomach. Whether the children had food or not doesn't matter. &gt;&gt; They've eaten a cow head and I've never seen a woman doing that. If you can see a woman eating a takeway, she doesn't complain. She will keep some. &gt;&gt; If you ask what is this provision for? &gt;&gt; She will say we taking the provision today. The only thing when you get home and Relax. You relax. None of your business. Let's respect our women. Amen. I I saw it the other day. I said to my wife, "Let's just go to the mall together. Let's remind oursel about that time when we didn't have kids, when we were still young." He said, "Sure." We get to the mall. We had some coffee. We had some ice cream, the nice meal. When we leave something, &gt;&gt; I saw her having something my hands in the pocket. And then I said, "What about this?" &gt;&gt; We left the child at home. I was saying there's conflicts at home. &gt;&gt; But let let him also taste this provision. &gt;&gt; It's the nature of a woman, they will focus on their keys, what they've been called to that when God, that's why God will come and speak to the women about their kids. Our wives know our kids. Amen. It's it's natural you like it or not. That is why our wives will give our kids the names as per what the angel of God speak to them. Esso was the same. Esso was the same in his character. Was a better man. than Jacob. But Rebecca didn't look at the better man than Jacob. He look at what God has said about he was more of a gentleman. He loved his father and the things that he's done. But God chose Jacob. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because Jacob They think he was cified he was massed. &gt;&gt; And then mama was even telling him my son, you are loved by God, you will be a great nation again. And this name Jacob will be changed to Israel. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Israel is the nation that God has loved. Rebecca was always preaching to Jacob that one day there will be a nation that comes from you and loved by God and it happened exactly. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is the month for the mama. I'm encouraging you. Keep on doing the keep on making us proud. Keep on looking after our kids. Keep on doing what God has told you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let me take another character. Esther, &gt;&gt; a woman. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; One day, &gt;&gt; oh, let me read this. I will explain. &gt;&gt; Marriage of the lamb. Marriage of the lamb spoken with &gt;&gt; marriage of the lamb. &gt;&gt; We know that little book of Esther. &gt;&gt; How that Mai, his uncle had a daughter and was down during the times of the reigns of beautiful type there. The king, one of the greatest king in the world that day. He had a great feast and he called the queen to come set by him. She wouldn't do it. She refused. So what did he do? He was so humiliated, [Music] didn't know what to do that his own wife wouldn't come. to what the wife of the king &gt;&gt; of Mary and Pesia. &gt;&gt; You see why previously I said we are amazed of how Israel &gt;&gt; hit Iran internally. Things started here. Esther &gt;&gt; Esther &gt;&gt; being a Jewish girl &gt;&gt; was married &gt;&gt; to the king of Iran. &gt;&gt; So in Iran they are Israelites. They are in the intelligence of Iran. They are in the media of Iran. They are in the business of Iran. They are in the army of Iran. Because man and the patience is Iran. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Esther was there. &gt;&gt; When he was there, &gt;&gt; then Mori had the message that Israel is in Iran shall be killed. And he said to Esther, "You are the one that is responsible because you are the wife of the king." Then Esther said, "Come what may, queen or no queen. I will stand for what I believed in. We need those women that will stand for what they believed in." He said, "I will stand for my nation. As long as I live, they will not kill them. In those days, when you want to see the king, you need a permission. Esther said, "No, I don't need permission. I go and see the king. He killed me. So be it. But I need to save my nation." Esther prepare herself and go to see the king. When she's there, the king point this road unto her it was mercy upon her. &gt;&gt; Then Esther started to narrate the story. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; King, there's a problem in the nation. &gt;&gt; There's a problem in the country. Amen. Amen. A certain nation that I belong to are on the verge of damn nation. They want to kill us. That's where the king realized and married an Israeli and she stood for that. She risk her life. You know when you risk your life, God is protecting you. For the word of God, if you save your life, God leaves you with your one of the days. And one of the king responded by saying, &gt;&gt; "Who's that?" And then you know the story. Go and read the whole chapter. He made something like a party. He invited the king, his men, ammon everyone. Then he he started to explain to the king that the person who want to kill me, who want to kill my nation is harmon. It was not nice because Hmon hated Israel hated when he pass everyone will bow. But when is there he couldn't bow for him because he say I must worship the true God alone nor any other man in this world be that I should be killed. So be it. Brothers and sisters, don't be scared. Don't try to save this flesh. Renom says, "Everything that you see with a naked eye has a beginning, has an end, it will have an end. Look unto the everlasting arm." Amen. Amen. Then the discussion went on and on and then at the end the king said, "I've heard there's a rope in Hmon's house. &gt;&gt; That was Hmon house. That was meant to hang. That rope must hang." Amen. Amen. Who took that risk? &gt;&gt; A woman knew the truth. He stood for the truth. But you are scared and he will go to to to Esther. &gt;&gt; Our life are in your hands. &gt;&gt; Can you say your wife is your your life is in the head of a woman? Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But said to Esther, &gt;&gt; you are the only rescue to us. &gt;&gt; And Esther &gt;&gt; stand for it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Modi was hanged. &gt;&gt; And Modi I mean I mean Hammon was hanged. took charge in Iran. &gt;&gt; So the Israelites used to rule in Iran. That is why they were not scared of them. That is why they were killing them. Amen. Amen. So we thank Esther &gt;&gt; for his stand. I wish today we could have esters today that can stand for this message. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brandham says &gt;&gt; when we say a nation we mean the conduct of a woman. If the woman is not in their position, nation is doomed. That is why in the Jewish culture they say a child is of a woman. In our culture a child is of a man. Do you understand? And do you understand why the Jews say a child is of a woman not of a man? Is because of one thing. The woman should keep them secret should be holy life. If they are holy and they live holy life whatever comes to them will remain holy. That is the reason that is why Israel was not allowed to marry to other nation. When they realized that they were marrying other nation and they want to get rid of them, God said to them, "A child is of a woman, those people are Israelites, bring them to Israel." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You know when men are alone they can fight and do whatever they want but when the women come state has changed. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Even if you are a strong man beating every man around. Yeah. Having all this beating them around. &gt;&gt; It's men fighting. But if your wife can come and just hold you saying you make people to love at us and all this power just [Music] you will see that man being humble. &gt;&gt; The woman has spoken. They are powerful. &gt;&gt; Say hold me. I'm going to kill him. Hold me. The woman won't say hold. She will just look. You see the things you are teaching children &gt;&gt; and he won't she won't repeat. &gt;&gt; You will see M saying take her be careful &gt;&gt; going another way. &gt;&gt; The woman has spoken. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. It's true. &gt;&gt; It happens to Elana. Elana had two wives. Benina and Hana. &gt;&gt; Benina had kids. &gt;&gt; He didn't care whether Hana has kids or not. What can we do? Here are my kids. But Hana couldn't sleep. That's why she will pray, pray until the priest thought she was drunk. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And when that woman pray, the product she's going to bring is the product from God. We don't hear anything about the children of Hana of of of Benina, but we started to hear about the children of Hana being Samuel, &gt;&gt; the prophet of God. That that's a child. That's a child of a prayer of a woman. Forward we go. Hana said we cannot go forward without myself having a son of my own womb until the priest said she's drunk. When she appro when he the priest approached him started to realize that this woman was praying for something. And the priest said to that woman prayed for. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So brothers and sisters, let's hold on because we are the bride of our Lord Jesus. We are the woman that God has chose. Don't get discouraged. There will be people, mocking at you, despising you, keep on holding on, keep on praying, keep on calling the name of God. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let me read what brother Brandham saying. &gt;&gt; Notice didn't wait now. &gt;&gt; Didn't wait now. Yes. God could have put a baby in her arms right now. But she went home happy knowing that in due season God will bring it to pass. That kind of people we need today taking God his way. Like today sometimes we called fanatics. because we pray and cried out. We're not fanatics, misunderstood, Amen. &gt;&gt; You won't be like them. Be who you are. Young sisters, don't be like them at university. Be a unique sister. Amen. Leave the mark. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; To the people. They will not tell you now. But they know the truth. They might say it later that there was a girl at this university. He was not like them. She was so unique. You left the mark. They will not forget your name. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes. Let's take another character. &gt;&gt; Amen. But this one is collective. &gt;&gt; During the time of Saul, he was a warrior. The Bible says Saul &gt;&gt; was tall, handsome and he was a warrior and he killed thousand people. He won the battles and everybody was praising him. And the women started the song that Saul Saul started the song Saul that he killed thousands. But David killed thousands of thousands. Ah, &gt;&gt; now you see women can put you in trouble. Yeah, my soul now is happy. &gt;&gt; The women are praising me. &gt;&gt; Then they have put David in the problem now. Saul hated David. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. that you how can they say you killed many. That means you are taking my glory. Then God sees the heart of Saul and his spirit lived him. The spirit of God. Brothers and sisters, let's walk carefully. &gt;&gt; Let's check once more. If the spirit of God is still in us, you might worship, continue worship, but the spirit of God no longer in you. Look, do the introspection. Ensure that in your heart, there's no envy. There's no bitterness. There's no grieving spirit. You are pure, you love all the children of God. when you walk &gt;&gt; ensured because the women were honest. The women &gt;&gt; were honest. &gt;&gt; And then Saul started to have envy, bitterness and hatred against David. Yeah, you can sing can sing harvest &gt;&gt; sings better from that day harvest. &gt;&gt; I start to hate harvest. &gt;&gt; Why are you outshining me? Why &gt;&gt; can I tell you we are not in a competition? Our God sends things harmoniously. The singers are there. The preachers are there, the deacons are there, the elders are there, the sisters, everyone is participating in the body of the Lord Jesus Christ. If you come here to sing out shining others, try next door. Not here. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So these women sign to be honest. Hey, they cost trouble. If you are try to be honest this morning, you might be in trouble. Amen. Amen. We we we we appreciate the children of God who stand for the cause of what they believe in. When you stand the cause of what you believe in, you forsake all. I was reading a quote last night. I didn't put here because it didn't talk about women. I'm having women code only here this morning. Brother Benham was saying if he wanted to be the most richest person in the world would have been like this. One day he pray for someone of a rich person. Now they signed $500 US $500,000 $500. &gt;&gt; They give it to brotherham say no. Now I can't continue asking what I wanted to ask. You wouldn't reject that offer because money &gt;&gt; has made many casualities. Brother Brenham should be our example. should learn from him the prophet of the age. God showed brother Brenham a well of oil that can sustain him sustain him the generation and generation of brother Brenham said no would you refuse that if you could have refused it going around looking for the diamond stones You are quiet because probably you want them. Let's learn. Let me tell you. I was talking to the brothers yesterday. I know this brother of mine, very nice brother, very close friend of mine. He has money. He was traveling with a white man. They were traveling to Kimali &gt;&gt; to get some stones. &gt;&gt; They had 120,000 cash. &gt;&gt; Brother the message. When they get to Kimali, they meet those people stone. Five of them. They park somewhere. They open the stone and they say, "Bring the money." It was in the briefcase. Open it. put it on the table. 120,000 cash,000. When the brother, took the stone, tried to test, they pull out their arm. They said, "Now you die here." Then they say, "Oh, sorry, sorry, sorry, so sorry." And they put their guns back. When they put their guns back, they took this stone. I I don't remember the first town after Kimali towards here. on N12 N12. &gt;&gt; They stopped there because they were following them. They were following them, but they were driving Mercedes-Benz Slas. You know, Mercedes-Benz, &gt;&gt; you won't run after it. It was too fast. 240 km per hour. He was telling me they stopped them. When they stopped there, they wanted to test. When when they wanted to test the stone, when they checked the stone, they were fake. &gt;&gt; They could have died for fake diamonds. Yeah. Okay. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There's this woman. We're talking about women. That woman, &gt;&gt; let's read the Bible and hear what it says. You will love her. &gt;&gt; I'm telling you the truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In First Samuel. Sure. When I was reading this, I said, "Yeah, &gt;&gt; we need women like Abigail." 1 Samuel &gt;&gt; chapter 25 &gt;&gt; we can read verse 2 and three &gt;&gt; don't hate me we have passed on the diamond issue is a close case let's read &gt;&gt; 1 Samuel chapter 25 from verse 1 to 3 &gt;&gt; no 2 to3 &gt;&gt; 2 to3 &gt;&gt; yes &gt;&gt; and there There was a man in mourn whose possessions were in Camel and the man was very great and he had 3,000 sheep and a thousand goats and he was sharing his sheep in camel. Now the name of the man was Naba and the name of his wife Abig and she was a woman of good understanding and of a beautiful countenance. But the man was ch child chalish and evil in his doings and he was of the house of Caleb. &gt;&gt; Mark that he was from the house of Caleb. &gt;&gt; Caleb. &gt;&gt; Read read verse 14. &gt;&gt; And verse 14. But one of the young men told Abigail Nabal's wife, saying, "Behold, David sent messengers out of the wilderness to salute our master, and he railed on them. Let me just give you the brief story. Go and read the whole chapter. This man from the house of Caleb was rich. Had many sheep and everything. All the money of those days and he had a wife. Yeah. I respect Abigail. &gt;&gt; When this man had money, &gt;&gt; he do whatever he wanted because he had everything. Now, one of the days when David and them in the mountain, they just saw the people of Naba Nab and then they protected them because David knowing very well are from the lineage of Caleb. They are Israelites &gt;&gt; and he need to protect and then they protected. After protecting them, he said to this man, "Go and greet the master." When they get there, they tell him about David. &gt;&gt; You understand? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he said, "Who's David from the son of Jesus? Who's there?" They say if you want to be to be known by your whole relative you must be rich. If you are poor they don't know you. But if you are rich everyone will say it's my uncle it's my cousin it's my brother. Even if you are not related because you are related to a rich man. &gt;&gt; David knew him but he don't know David and they were drinking. You know when sometimes you are in the house you find the brothers are talking the sister is singing and they are talented these people in the kitchen cooking singing but the other ear is listening to what you saying very much talented. You will think you are in a secret chamber. Just come and give you and wipe [Applause] you when the brothers leave. You are now going astray. How can you speak so badly? God will punish you. &gt;&gt; How did you hear? &gt;&gt; Don't worry. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Am I lying? &gt;&gt; Abigail was making food and he had a talking. They were talking about David. Who's he is a disaster. They don't like him. They were doing this. Abigail was there. When everybody left, he went to her husband. He said, "You messed up." The man who was drunk, he got sober immediately. &gt;&gt; Because something shake you 95% alcohol, you become sober. The first thing you will need water. It will appear because the woman of the woman who knew who David was said to her husband, we are killed today. &gt;&gt; That man became sober immediately. Then Abigail &gt;&gt; even said to her husband because your name your name said who you are which one I'm going to rescue my family. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; You read verse 18. &gt;&gt; Those are the woman &gt;&gt; you can bank on &gt;&gt; very much careful. &gt;&gt; Verse 18. Then Abigail made haste and took 200 loaves and two bottles of wine and five sheep ready rest and five measures of patched corn &gt;&gt; and in 100 clusters of raisins &gt;&gt; and 200 cakes of figs &gt;&gt; and laid them ones be &gt;&gt; and she said unto &gt;&gt; stop there you can go to 23. Then she she started to prepare something for David to stop his wrath. That's a woman. Verse 23. &gt;&gt; But this man will say, "Oh, he's a man and he can come. This woman I will read what said before we we read 23. Listen to this. What did he say about the old David? He was up there. She said &gt;&gt; that is Abigail &gt;&gt; to David. &gt;&gt; Your soul, you can see Abigail knew who David was. Your soul is wrapped &gt;&gt; in a bundle of joy. &gt;&gt; When Abigail great woman that met David said, "We know that your enemies will flung out like a sling sling." That's right. Because you are wrapped in the bundle of the lap of God. Abigail knew that you cannot challenge the anointed one of But his man was foolish. But the woman, the woman make it clear and say none can stand before David. David is the anointed man of God. Try, challenge your pastor. I don't want to go further. Amen. &gt;&gt; He is the anointed man of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Talk better about him. I won't go further, but he is the anointed man. Verse 23. &gt;&gt; Verse 23. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And when Abigail saw David, she hasted and lighted off the earth and fell before David on her face and bowed herself to the ground. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That has rescued the entire family. &gt;&gt; David, look at the woman. Look at the boys because he said to the boys, "Kill all of them." But when Abigail, a woman took a stand, a right stand, despising his foolish husband, things turn around. Brothers, be careful what you're talking amongst the women, amongst your kids. We'll catch up with you one day. And then David &gt;&gt; take his sword &gt;&gt; back to his place &gt;&gt; because the woman respected him. &gt;&gt; Don't just go forward as a man. Don't hear from a woman. Let's continue. &gt;&gt; Women are powerful. But I'm saying this because it's their month. There's a woman by the name of mother to Solomon. a woman of valor. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said to David that &gt;&gt; you promise me &gt;&gt; that my son will be the king after you. But what are you doing now? Because Adonijah took the throne. David said, "No, no, no. That will never happen." Solomon. &gt;&gt; Solomon &gt;&gt; is the king. &gt;&gt; Who put Solomon on the throne? &gt;&gt; His mother. &gt;&gt; David forgot. &gt;&gt; But the woman says that seat, &gt;&gt; that throne &gt;&gt; belongs to my son. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, it happened. &gt;&gt; I'm trying to be fast. &gt;&gt; Yes. Another woman, Jezebel. I just want to show you how powerful woman is. Sometimes you can go to work, &gt;&gt; come back home angry as you can get that from this one, this one they don't want me, they want this one and your wife will just say and she will make after making coffee I've already started the car. Let's go. and buy a gun and then we're going to kill them all. &gt;&gt; Even if you didn't have money, &gt;&gt; you're going to make it &gt;&gt; because the wife said so. &gt;&gt; Because the gun shoot them all. That's how powerful they can. Yes. He came home angry. threw himself on the sofa. I'm a king but they undermine me sat next to him. Don't forget who you are. You are the king and no one can challenge you. He put him in a dungeon &gt;&gt; appeal &gt;&gt; living. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Let's hear what the brother says. The &gt;&gt; invasion of the United States. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, but Ahab just fell for her because she was preaching, I suppose. men. It couldn't be nothing else but her because of her wicked as she was and she come over there and then cause h cause being wrapped up with her like that loved her. Why? He caused all Israel to sin, to go against God and to tear down the altars of God, build up altars of Balim. And they they they had Bal worship all throughout Israel at that time. Now his wife has caused righteous Nabot. Many of you has read of him how he took his garden. deceit. Saw a lie and a false witness against him because she wanted to do something for her husband and killed a righteous man in order to get a guard and just join close to the palace. Now the vengeance of Nabot will come from God. all this God was looking down. So the prophet Elijah which was great mighty servant of God prophesied and told Jezebel what will happen to her. He told Ahab that the dogs will leak his own blood. Now when God has said anything cost them days the direct way of the Lord came through the prophet Ahab's blood &gt;&gt; was leaked by dogs. Jezebel's blood, I'm saying, &gt;&gt; Ahab's blood was leaked by dogs. &gt;&gt; Jezebel's blood was leaked by dogs. That was the vengeance from God. &gt;&gt; Brothers and sisters, don't fight your battle. Let God fight your battle. The vengeance is from God. Let God do everything for you. You will see how much he loves you. Don't be like vengeance. Don't be like Jezebel who misled her own husband. [Music] Be like Abigail protected the family. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's read Matthew chapter 28. and look at time. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Matthew chapter 28. Let's read from verse one &gt;&gt; until 7. &gt;&gt; Matthews 28 from verse one until 7. &gt;&gt; Amen. In the end of the Sabbath, as it began to dawn toward the first day of the week, came Mary Magdalene and the other Mary to see the Sapala. And behold, there was a great earthquake, for the angel of the Lord descended from heaven, and came and rolled back the stone from the door, and set upon it. His countenance was like lightning, and his remnant white as snow. And for fear of him the keepers did shake and became as dead men. And the angel answered and said unto the woman, "Fear not ye, for I know that ye seek Jesus which was crucified. He is not here, for he is risen, as he said, come see the the place where the Lord lay &gt;&gt; and go quickly and tell his disciples that he is risen from the dead. And behold, he goeth before you in Galilee, there shall ye see him. Lo, I have told you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Talking to the women. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Women, let's just respect women's month. been attacking men. No, I'm just encouraging our sisters, the word of God, the Lord. We are very much aware talking to them. You see here the angel is talking to women. The women had that ear of listening that on the third day he shall rise. Peter and them, &gt;&gt; they had it. But let's fix our fishing lines. When they were fixing their fishing line, the women were there knowing he will arrive and they stand there. And the angel come and speak to the women. He's not here. is risen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You women go and tell them the disciples Peter, Thomas, Baramelo, Luke, Luke, every one of them, go and tell them that I shall meet them. Do you understand? Amen. Then the sisters has to run and tell them that he is risen. go to Galia, he will come and meet you. Amen. We must just keep on keeping on. You know the story of a Samaritan woman. How he got the message after getting the message. Jesus met her at the well. Then he went back to the city and tell them that Jesus whom we waited whom was spoken by the prophet. &gt;&gt; The last one &gt;&gt; is this on Acts chapter 18. You know the scripture &gt;&gt; uh verse 24- 26. &gt;&gt; Verse 24- 26. &gt;&gt; The Bible speaks about &gt;&gt; Apollo. Apollo. Apollo was a great man. &gt;&gt; A man who was preaching Jesus Christ genuinely time. Amen. Amen. And the Bible says Priscilla and Aquil went to attend their service. After hearing the word of God, Priscilla approached Apollo and said, "Men of God, you preach a powerful We enjoyed our stay here, but I want you to meet Paul. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brazil &gt;&gt; never stay there and say &gt;&gt; and started to preach to him. He said, "No, I'm not allowed to preach, but I can take this to Paul. You and Paul can talk about it. Our gospel, brothers and sisters, &gt;&gt; they knew very well if he can meet Paul, we are going to baptize our gospel that we have, nothing can stop it. Keep on going with it. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; That is why when Timothy was ordained as a pastor but the ministers will say stay in the faith of Louise your grandmother. the women that stayed in the faith until a pastor, newly ordained pastor was asked to follow the faith of his grandmother. How powerful Louise was. I finish as the B coming because I'm done. &gt;&gt; Brother Brenham, &gt;&gt; I'm going to meet him. He went through a lot. &gt;&gt; I'm talking about your prophet. He went through a lot. Brother Brandham had a wife. Hope &gt;&gt; she depart and she married Mid &gt;&gt; and Mid &gt;&gt; was 10 years younger than brother and let me read this and then here some time ago from the spoken do you now believe amen I will tell you a little story that you might not think was just right. I come in a room where the kitchen &gt;&gt; and the whole house had been piled full this room that room downstairs everywhere. And then when I was getting through along about from early that morning, it was about 5:00. &gt;&gt; We've been turning everybody away. The boys are at the gate. So for they keeping the people away. And I went out into the kitchen. There is my wife seat out there crying as hard as she could cry. Two girls, they were sitting on the floor and fighting over their blocks and the house was torn up. Everything that mirror said or my wife said, "Really, I'm going wild." She said, "This children hasn't had a bite to eat all day long. The kitchen &gt;&gt; standing full, the house standing full and all. She said, "Oh, I said 35 years old whiteheaded and and stand between me and the public. You want me to explain this? &gt;&gt; Amen. It was a mess in the house of brother Bren. &gt;&gt; The man whom you think is perfect and he is &gt;&gt; perfect. Look at the situation. When the wife was like that, mess in the house. Kids are going up and down, not allowing visitors in the house. And the wife said, "I'm going wild." But brother Brennan says she was young and she started to look like an old person. She was 35 years of age. But when you look at me, she was like 50 years of age because of the condition of that day. Brother, look at her at the way she she stood between me and a woman of valor. Sister Miller against all odds, against all the criticism that brother Brandham had by the sight of brother Bren. We need such woman. Divorce is not a rescue. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But I have to say it. &gt;&gt; Mira never stood there and say, "Billy, I leave the house." Mira just said to Billy, "I'm going wild, I'm confused. I don't have direction." But she stood by his side. Today, men and women, they want divorce as the rescue in their marriage. I know why you are quiet because others are thinking of divorce. It's not the way. Come back. Be like me. Stand for the what you saw before God and before the pastor before the church do part. I don't deny you divorcing, but it's not what we teach in this church. She said, &gt;&gt; "Oh, why? I just know don't know what to do." And the poor little fellow sorry for him. That is brother Brenham feeling sorry for me that what she went through irrespective of the condition of my wife I will stand by her side of the condition of your house you will stand by his side I know it's difficult to swallow but I have to say it because Today education, money has come into the church and the children of God they lost the taste of the message. This is not my time. This is not my time. Divorce is the solution. Not in this church. [Applause] be a woman or father who will say, "Whatever my husband is going through, whatever my wife is going through, I will kneel down. I will pray for the situation. God will rescue the situation, not the divorce because you make the devil." God bless you. Amen. Let's sing unto the Lord. Got something up. [Music] and shame. Go see [Music] the [Music] king.

Therefore, let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God hath made that same Jesus whom he have crucified both Lord and Christ. Now when they heard this, they were pricricked in their heart and said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, "Men and brethren, what shall we do?" Then Peter said unto them, "Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost.
