Dear pastor and tabernacle, we would like to sincerely thank you for sending Elder Deacon Peter Kosana to minister at our outreach program held at Bulga Center Debon on the 12th and the 13th of July. His preaching was truly a blessing, spiritfilled, uplifting and his and impactful. We were grateful. We were great. We were greatly encouraged by the word and deeply appreciate your leadership and spiritual covering. Thank you for making it possible for us to be nourished and strengthened through such a powerful ministry. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Okay. It continues as brother William Brenham once said, "God doesn't call the trained. He trains the called." &gt;&gt; This quote beautifully reflects what we experience. A servant of God truly called and used mightily in the service of the Lord. In line with it, we are reminded of the scripture. and I will give you and I will give you pastors according to mine heart which shall feed you with knowledge and understanding. That is Jeremiah 3:15. May God continue to bless you abundantly, guide your ministry and use you to rise to raise more vessels for his kingdom. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You know, Elders Kosana used to say he always thanks the pastor &gt;&gt; that he has taught them from all these years. So when we see such a commence, we say thank the Lord for the good work that has been done through our pastor. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So we are continuing. We've got our visitors. &gt;&gt; Okay, let's start with the first one there.

He might not be here physically. But spiritual is always there whenever you need him. &gt;&gt; If you are spiritual, you can find him. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.

We thank God for the privilege giving us health, giving us the message, opening of the seals and we are together as brothers and sisters of like precious faith. [Music] Each one each and every one of you is very important. Brother Bonham says, "None of us here would have been here had he been the Lord didn't lead them to be here." Amen. &gt;&gt; So our visitors, it is God who has led you here. Our children, it is God who has led you to Because if God didn't lead you here, you'd have been somewhere else.

Had it been there was a better place where we could have gone would have gone there. But we have been clever enough to know that it is here where our help comes from. David said whenever I was in trouble, he was looking up unto your mountain. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Where your his help was coming from. &gt;&gt; We are here Lord just are waiting for you to come and alive and bless us and deliver us. Be with those who are sick. Lord we pray that you heal them. Those who have backsteened, you restore them. &gt;&gt; Those who are lost, Father, you save them. as you're committing every one of us, &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus. It's not about a man. It's about you. &gt;&gt; Come down, Lord, and be with your people as they're waiting upon thee. In Jesus Christ name we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, how many of you pray today that uh the Lord should speak to you? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I hope we didn't pray that should speak to you. So if you pray that God should speak to you, trust your prayer, that God is going to answer your prayer today. [Music] Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Uh I didn't know that I I was going to be here. Not at all. &gt;&gt; I am here by faith. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yeah. I I I was just told &gt;&gt; the pastor wants you now. So I was in I wasn't at home. &gt;&gt; So I drove from Blanta to Lionga to get on a plane to come. I alive last night [Applause] &gt;&gt; and I'm leaving in the morning. &gt;&gt; Yes, but I'll be back. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, I didn't know that I'll be here. I didn't know that I would be preaching this year. And so this message was the one which was for our church in Malawi there. So when you hear the message, it's applicable to Malawians. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So this is a message for Malawians. So if it's applicable to you, just know that something is supernatural is happening. [Music] Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; So let's go to Oh, okay. Hebrews. &gt;&gt; I don't know whether to It will work today. &gt;&gt; Hebrews 11. &gt;&gt; Unfortunately, at home, we read the whole chapter, &gt;&gt; but here I don't think we should do that. &gt;&gt; You know, when when you're at home, you can take your time. Yeah. So you going to display the first the the first uh the first uh slide. &gt;&gt; Yeah. So Hebrew Hebrews the second slide I should say. The second slide. Yes. Give me the second slide. &gt;&gt; Yes. Now faith &gt;&gt; is the substance &gt;&gt; of things hoped for. the evidence &gt;&gt; of things which are not seen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I want to stop there because at home we went up to verse 40. But uh let's just say today we are talking about faith. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So you can be seated. We have already prayed. Please sit comfortably. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yeah. So now faith &gt;&gt; substantiates &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Uh God bless you. I saw brother somewhere. We were together last Sunday. &gt;&gt; God bless you my brother. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We met on spiritual grounds in Malawi there. &gt;&gt; I never knew him. He never knew him. But his spirit and my spirit connected and we met. A man which I've never known before just came to be in my office against all odds. That's what happened. Ask him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Since then, we've been brothers. &gt;&gt; So when he came to preach, he started preaching as if he's pastor said, "Ah, now I know you." He was following each and every paragraph. [Music] I said, "My brother God bless you. &gt;&gt; Preach again. &gt;&gt; Preach again. Preach again. He was almost preaching every day. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But we met. He had come to visit other churches there. Um they were not lucky enough to ask him to preach. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So faith &gt;&gt; substantiates things hoped for. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So a lot of you here have had children. Some of you have got children. Five years old, 6 years old, seven years old. If you tell your child who knows your abilities unless you are a very poor father. But if you are a father, you tell your child, "Hey son, &gt;&gt; this year I'm going to give give you a birthday." He goes to school. &gt;&gt; He told his friend, "This year, &gt;&gt; you're going to attend my birthday. Because my father says I'll have a birthday. He's already trading something which is not there but his faith tells him his birthday is on he can trade on it. If you can say, "Oh, tomorrow I'll give you 50 rands." &gt;&gt; You can go to a shop at the corner, give me sweets. Give me that. How are you paying tomorrow? He has got faith enough to believe that you cannot faith. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That is why but the Bible says without faith we cannot be able to please God because God wants us to believe him as much as a fiveyear-old can believe his father that there's going to be a birthday. Amen. Amen. So we need to take God on his word. Hallelujah. Romans uh Romans 1:17 says 1:17 therein there's lousiousness God revealed from faith to faith as it is written the just shall live by faith. We live by faith. &gt;&gt; We don't live by knowledge. Let &gt;&gt; let alone salaries. &gt;&gt; We live by faith, tomorrow. If there is tomorrow, we will move from faith to faith. We don't become stagnant in faith. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Um faith which we should have it's that common day faith common day faith. When God wanted the Israelites to apply the token, he told them to take hissop was a common wheat. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That's slide number five. Brother &gt;&gt; is just a common weed by his was just common wheats. Apply the token using his faith. Somebody tries to make faith supernatural. That's the reason we miss a lot of things. Believe God as a five-year-old. Faith is just a common thing. You go to you got faith to come to church. You got faith to walk out here. You got you you sat your car. You got faith. You got faith to eat your dinner. That's the way it is. Just common faith. Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't try to make your faith as if it's something which you graduate from vit. It's not like that. When God says believe it as it is already done, &gt;&gt; it's just common. Amen. &gt;&gt; Everyday faith. Amen. &gt;&gt; To believe God. Amen. &gt;&gt; So what is defeating us now? Fear. Fear is defeating us. One of the greatest cases of the church today is fear. Everybody's scared. You are scared about the economy. Scared about your job security. You know what you you can read the quotation there isn't it? &gt;&gt; What does the prophet says? &gt;&gt; What's the greatest fa what's the greatest case which we have is fear. &gt;&gt; The greatest thing that I find against the church tonight everybody here is g getting mentally crazy. You are in you live in fear. You are scared. Oh, am I going to get married? Or am I going to get a job? Am I going to get a house? Am I going to get this? What? What are you scared about? If a man is born again, he should be happy and carefree. Don't be scared. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Fear. No fear. &gt;&gt; The greatest break that it is in the Christian church today. They are afraid. That's the reason they are because you are not taught right. &gt;&gt; Don't be fearful. Even if you fear, what what do you what do to help you? &gt;&gt; So many people here. I can ask you sisters here. Some of you have been in the message for 30, 40 years until now you feel as if you are sinners. When did you last sin? [Music] I told another brother one day he comes and tells about hey sin you're condemning you are sinning you hey you're sinning he says that was preaching I said my brother [Music] &gt;&gt; you are wasting time when you preach about mini skates you wasting time &gt;&gt; because my wife there has never put on a min for 30 years. So she'll be saying amen but doesn't help her. The message doesn't help her. &gt;&gt; She'll be saying amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; But for her, she has never worn a skate for a mean skate for maybe 30 years. Why? What's why? How does a message of min help you? Because a message which is coming to you has to take you from faith to faith. Not just condemning others. Others are condemned by what you your faith is doing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So if we keep faith, this place &gt;&gt; could be a beehive of the power of God buzzing around here. flying everywhere. &gt;&gt; People are always reminded of their shortcomings. Not of their victories. Amen. Young people up there, you got more victories than I have. My sister there. Your victory wear that long dress is much more than me preaching here because you are walking victory. Whenever you wear that long dress at University of Johansburg is victory unto the Lord. Victory unto the Lord. &gt;&gt; What did Gideon tell his to his army? Did you know what Hion told to his army? He told them he had discounted a lot of them. But he told them he told them started burning. What? What did he tell them? The sword of the the sword of the Lord. The sword of Gideon. The sword of the Lord. The sword of the sword of the sword of the sword of the Lord. The sword of the of the Lord of moving forward. &gt;&gt; The Lord of Aaron is the Lord of the Lord of Your car is car. &gt;&gt; Be careful that car. It's not yours. It's your car and it's off. And one day you think it's yours. You see your sister walking and you pass by. That's your car. It was of God. The son of God would have been inside there. If your brother can't walk into your house and drink tea is not the house of the Lord. That one is yours. &gt;&gt; If you have a house beautiful enough that the son of God, anyone in here cannot go in. That one is yours. is of God. Every son of God in here can go in there. The sight of the Lord is a sort of &gt;&gt; Yes. If you starting from today, if you see your sister walking, don't let her walk. Stop. You you can't have a car beautiful enough for the son of God. Your car can be beautiful enough that you can't pick son of son of Mr. but not for of God. You can leave the son of a walk. But the son of God. Amen. Amen. So be careful. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So whatever we are doing here, make sure each and every one of us we are on an equal footing. Whatever we have, we have asked from God, we cannot deny his children. What we have asking from one day the master came and he was approaching a fig tree. &gt;&gt; So the fig tree was very rudy enough. [Music] It was rude because it told Jesus, "I can't give you figs because it's not yet time. But when we see a dry tree going into the shakina glory very same night, it gave out its fruit inside it. The tree wanted the master to bake. I told my church, I'll never come one day and start preaching about tithing. No, the person doesn't need to beg your tithe. If you are a dead tree here overnight tomorrow there will be almonds growing around you &gt;&gt; because you are in the presence of the shakina growing the shakina is here yourself coming to church &gt;&gt; is a victory accepting collect baptism is a victory. Accepting the correct marriage is a victory. &gt;&gt; Accept a sent God prophet is a victory. Accepting God sent pastor is a victory. Count your blessings. My brother, &gt;&gt; we have taken &gt;&gt; something which the whole world has rejected was was with the prophet for a long time. He never believed in the seven seals. But we have never seen the prophet. But we have heard &gt;&gt; from our pastor here that the seals are open. &gt;&gt; I believe the seals are open. &gt;&gt; You know the problem with a church They, you know, the religion of Cain, &gt;&gt; the religion of Cain, &gt;&gt; religion &gt;&gt; is about trying to let God accept you as you are. No, God accepts his word. When Cain went wrong, He should have gone to brother Abel and say, "Brother, the Lord has rejected my my my my sacrifice. How did you do it?" But Kane wants God to accept him as he is. Kane should have gone to Abel. My brother, how can I do this? &gt;&gt; Everywhere you find the children of Cain, you find the same arrogance. They want God to accept them without following God's word. Kane wanted God to accept his sacrifice because he had the sacrifice. I have sacrificed. I have sacrificed. I have sacrificed. I have sacrificed. I have sacrificed for this church. I have sacrificed for this church. I have sacrificed for this church. God accept it. God was telling me that's not the way to sacrifice. &gt;&gt; No, but I've sacrificed. So you when his son came came he told his brothers brothers let's go and follow God to heaven so what we do yeah let's build a tower he wanted go to go and find God without repenting us. &gt;&gt; So I wanted to arrive in heaven without repenting. You can find the same spirit in a denominational person. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. But faith &gt;&gt; is not imaginary. Faith is a direct revelation from God to you. My brother, &gt;&gt; especially those of you who are born in this me in this message, it's not the faith of your father. You got faith of your own. How many people have been born in this church and not they're not serving God today? But you are saving him. &gt;&gt; It's because God revealed something to you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So Abel rolled up the rock and made the church to worship a place. Faith isn't something that is imaginary. I I believe you are not seeing that I'm I'm reading quotations, isn't it? &gt;&gt; You are saying yeah because for me to say let's go to this book. Let's go to this book. Um I've got about 45 slides here. So might take us about two days. So let me just speak. You'll be following the you'll be following the quotations. Faith isn't something imaginary. Faith is a direct revelation. [Music] Revelation one says, "The revelation which God had which he gave to his son, But he sent it &gt;&gt; and signified it to John &gt;&gt; by his angel. &gt;&gt; And that angel is none other than William Marion brother. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's a revelation. It's not something which is mentally perceived. You cannot have you cannot please God without him giving you the ability to please him. That ability to please God is what we call faith. Remember when we testify to you in the streets, brother is he preaches in the in the trains. &gt;&gt; There might be 30 people sitting there. You know, baptism is not just sprinkling water taking water. Somebody took water. You find somebody says, "Ah, that's true. We find someone say I does it matter who made that one to say that is true and who made the other one to say it doesn't matter what taught able to offer a better sacrifice the same thing which I told you to be here You cannot teach people how to receive revelation &gt;&gt; because revelation is from God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When Peter &gt;&gt; talked about Jesus being the son of God, He told him, "Peter, &gt;&gt; that's not flesh and blood &gt;&gt; by the father." &gt;&gt; Faith is not something which can be mentally perceived. That is why when we are here, we follow a baptism which Peter taught us. We knew &gt;&gt; this man has got a direct revolution from &gt;&gt; So when you know that your pastor has got a direct revelation, you better follow what he says. Yes. Next slide, my brother. Let's read it together. That one. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's just take where I have highlighted because the slides are too many. And when God sees a man that can receive revelations from above, he can trust that man and do something with him. And when God sees a man that can receive revelations from above, &gt;&gt; he can trust that man and do something. When it's revealed to him because he says no man can reveal but his father. So Peter was in contact with the spirit. &gt;&gt; He knows you also can be in contact with the spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So one day Peter a man with he we say Peter had he was in contact with the spirit Peter was uh in contact with the spirit isn't it? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Peter sees Jesus walking on water. He says Lord if it's you let me come as well. So he went there &gt;&gt; and started walking on water. &gt;&gt; Peter walked on water. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So &gt;&gt; something happened. Who did say Peter Petro? &gt;&gt; Let's start from there. I have high. I don't I don't want to uh he says I am going to walk because the word says I can I can walk but he looked at the waves how big the waves were he got scared when he did he went down he feared &gt;&gt; so what happened what he feared happened when he believed. He could walk and he walked. &gt;&gt; When he believed when he got scared, the substance left him. Sorry there. The sub his substance left him. Amen. &gt;&gt; He still professed to have faith, but he didn't have the substance. So when you can believe it will happen. &gt;&gt; When you cannot believe it will not happen. That's why all the time brother every day only believe [Music] all things are possible. [Music] Every time the prophet he went into the grave only believe. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That common faith my brother in the book of Job. &gt;&gt; Did you do did you know what happened to Job? Job feared and what he feared actually happened. What brought it? His fear. That's what made it to happen that he should lose his children. His faith would have kept him from it. But his faith brought it on him. He was scared that it will happen that one day he will lose his children. Do you see that's a quotation? Amen. &gt;&gt; What he feared happened &gt;&gt; but have faith like a child. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Oh, &gt;&gt; if this holy church only realize its power to do the things, there's so much doubt and fear and trembling and wondering here. Not not there's so much doubting wondering would it happen as long as that exists [Music] the church can never stand upright. But when every talk of fear vanishes, that's why the minister stop making people fear here. Let the talk of fear vanish here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Uh when when uh Melody &gt;&gt; Sundowns &gt;&gt; is waiting for pirates to come the coach tells them don't fear don't fear. So when they come near the ground they start jumping jumping they tell pirates &gt;&gt; today you are going to see things all talk of fear vanishes the captain tells stand put more power put more Stand stand. 50/50 50. Press. Don't fear him. What they are trying to do is to make fear vanish. When fear vanishes, You will see what will happen to you. [Applause] When fear vanishes, the Holy Spirit is completely in control of the church and all fear is gone and the church has got power. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You tell the devil, &gt;&gt; you are the ambassadors of the throne. &gt;&gt; Absolutely. &gt;&gt; You are an ambassador of Christ. &gt;&gt; We we got the power in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So uh the time which I was uh in school we are still fighting the bulas. &gt;&gt; So they come with guns. So the boys they coming with guns like this but they were fighting with power is with us. They didn't fear &gt;&gt; because once you have fear, the enemy will take you for granted. Amen. &gt;&gt; There was no fear. You will hear, "Oh, they have short three, four, 10. Tomorrow they back in the streets." Amen. Because they were shooting the people so that the others should say if we go back they will shoot us. The devil will shoot you. Don't go back. How many people will backslide here? Start jumping. Amanda We have the power. The whole powers of heaven is in is right in your hands. Where's the power is with us. &gt;&gt; It's here. The whole powers of heaven is with. &gt;&gt; So whatever the devil can do, try to scare us, scare us this way, scare us this way, start jumping. The power is with us. We don't have the guns. We don't have the bullets. We don't have the nuclear. But the power is with us. And the church is barren because we don't recognize that the power is with us. Hallelujah. Amen. We didn't recognize it. I believe you see you see that's a quotation. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Joshua one day &gt;&gt; stopped the sun. &gt;&gt; Let me tell you the physics. &gt;&gt; The sun, the earth is rotating at 1,600 km per hour and is landing 100,000 km/ hour around the sun and the sun is orbiting the Milky Way galaxy at 1 million km/ hour and our galaxy is moving around the other the universe. Yes. 2.2 million km per hour. &gt;&gt; 2.2 million kilometers per hour. Joshua says stop. That's why maybe the scientist cannot cannot accept it because says &gt;&gt; that was nothing. &gt;&gt; It was very little because Joshua &gt;&gt; was dealing with material which was already there. But when it comes to the creation of the squirrels, &gt;&gt; God created the squirrels from nothing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Powerful. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Joshua was dealing with material which was already there. &gt;&gt; The creation of the squirrels. Yeah, that one my brother. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that that was perfect faith. No vision. Just speak. Never saw a squirrel. He just that's just scripture speak doubt and I took God at his word and there it was. &gt;&gt; That's right. A friend as your pastor. That's as powerful as it was when Joshua stopped the sunsh because the son was already there. &gt;&gt; He just stopped the movement. But this he brought something that wasn't there. &gt;&gt; He created. I'm so glad to be acquainted with a God that can take dust of the earth. Someday when you be lying in the grave regardless wherever your dust will be, God will just call it up. Amen. &gt;&gt; The way he caught the squirrels. Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. The church can can only thrive. The church cannot thrive until the supernatural is made known to them. Do you see why the pastors always want you to know the supernatural? You cannot thrive as a church. Something supernatural is happening. [Applause] You need a God which you can talk to. And can talk back to you. That's the God you need. You need a God which you can talk to. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let me uh jump a few ones. So, how does faith come? &gt;&gt; By hearing, &gt;&gt; by you go to number 24, my brother Jeremiah Jeremiah 3:15. I will give you pastor's offering to my own heart which will feed you with knowledge and understanding. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So when you see the pastor is trying to make sure that you get this, you get this, you get this, he's trying to fulfill Jeremiah 3 verse 15. Jeremiah 3:15. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; No, we don't need you don't need your pastor. No. Okay, that's fine. &gt;&gt; But remember, &gt;&gt; the word is &gt;&gt; the word is a sword. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The word is what? &gt;&gt; But a sword &gt;&gt; doesn't go to war. &gt;&gt; It needs a strong hand [Applause] for it to work. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; This is a quotation which I have. &gt;&gt; What do we do? &gt;&gt; Take the sword which is the word of God. Pull it with a hand of faith. A strong hand of faith. The word of God on its own. We have the word. We have the word. You need to have a strong hand of faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The word on its own can do nothing unless it's held by a strong hand of faith. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So even though the sword be the to be the word [Music] it takes the strong hand of faith &gt;&gt; to hold it there &gt;&gt; and bring it to the heart of the enemy. Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; So stop dancing. We have the word. You have the word. No. No. No. Where's Where's your faith? Because the word has to be held by a strong hand of faith. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; I hold faith key in my hand. in my heart that says God that will quench the virus of fire. It will unlock the healing. It will unlock salvation knowing that you got a key faith. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So the sword of the king &gt;&gt; is the word &gt;&gt; but the word &gt;&gt; needs to be held up by a strong hand of faith. You know South Africa has got very big guns and Malawi but if their soldiers are not fit they can be defeated. So you have to have good guns and you also have to have soldiers which are fit. 29. My brother, that's why the church has done these things. &gt;&gt; All the gifts to go God, you just pin them up. They're not usable. Let them loose. Exercise your faith. Get some muscles in your faith. [Music] Let me tell you, faith has got hairs on its chest. When faith speaks, everything settles down. When it speaks, everything shuts down. Faith has to have chest hair on his chest. &gt;&gt; Faith is a boss and it's got big muscles. It's It's a quotation, my brother. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's got big muscles. All worries drop from the side of the other. &gt;&gt; All worries should disappear. &gt;&gt; Let your worries. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know sometimes we forget who we are. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We forget. &gt;&gt; Um it's like uh Mr. Laposa's son uh worrying about buying a car. Because if you son your word is not about having a car. What your is to say can I get a Lamborghini or a Bugatti or that's your worry. If I go to if I go to that garage am I going to find a car of my size? Your problem is not the dollars. Your problem is about the if you the car which are there can be of your type. V8 V8. &gt;&gt; You're looking for a V16. &gt;&gt; That's what faith should give you. &gt;&gt; Don't be fearful. You have everything. Our world is not about South Africa or whether I can buy a plot or a word. No sons of God. Can I just create my own land, my own planet so I can live on it? The sons and daughters of God would create the world out there and go and live a private life on it. It's a quotation there. You have the power to do that. You can even create your own small earth somewhere and you go and live a private life on it. It's not me. We speaking. Do you understand? It's not me. We speaking. &gt;&gt; We speaking that in you. There's power to create a world up there. You go and live there in private life. You have power to do it. Amen. You got just a shadow of the power of God in you, but you got power to do it. God is omnipotent. The power in you will make you speak a word into existence and go and live on it. Amen. Hey my brother, &gt;&gt; you're being living in a rented house. Yet you got power to create the whole world. &gt;&gt; Speak it. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. One day &gt;&gt; he told Moses &gt;&gt; go to that rock &gt;&gt; it will give you it water. &gt;&gt; How many geologists here? &gt;&gt; What what percentage of water is in the rock? The hardest thing you can ever get water from is a rock. Moses was able to get water from a rock to feed two million people &gt;&gt; with their goats, cows, chickens. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So lest we forget who are we being. But but the thing it is we forget who we are. Oh brother, &gt;&gt; you that's born again are sons and daughters of God coequal with Jesus &gt;&gt; in his presence. Oh my. Oh my. That's what makes the devil angry is to let this church realize who they are. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hey, sometimes I could take if I could just take shake this place up and the people should realize who they are. Hey, wake up. You son. You can buy any other wake up. Wake up. &gt;&gt; You don't have to touch it. It has to be a spiritual touch. &gt;&gt; Remember, it is you &gt;&gt; who drives the gift in your pastor. &gt;&gt; Amen. When Hana was praying, when Eli &gt;&gt; who was a backseated minister, &gt;&gt; bride saw him saw her praying says woman, hey, what is your trouble? says, "Oh no, your your handmmaid is in trouble." Eli didn't ask Hannah, "What is it?" He just said, "Whatever you have been praying, God grants it." Whatever you've been praying, God grants it. Amen. &gt;&gt; Didn't even ask her what was it a car? Was it a house? He just said, "Hannah, go your way." Whatever you pray, God. The woman with a blood issue, no one had been had been healed by touching Jesus, but herself. Something inside her told her that man which others are slapping, others are are talking nonsense about just go and touch him. Let all others say whatever they want to say. Some are even spitting in his face. She was a nobody. But to her, she just touched. She got everything. He didn't mind what the Pharisees said. She didn't mind what the Pharisees said. She didn't mind what the scribes said. She just knew if I could just touch, &gt;&gt; hey, let's talk about Auntie Jamaima &gt;&gt; until a praying had to stop. Amen. Amen. We we have brother Martin here. Uh actually when it's raining light rain &gt;&gt; can help propel the jet faster even than when it's not raining. But if there's too much water, it can give the frame to go out. God put enough water in the air there to kill the engineers. They said, "No, this water is too much. Let's land." &gt;&gt; What stop? What? What? What did put the water there? &gt;&gt; God. Because Jamaima was praying. Auntie Jamaima was not from auntie. &gt;&gt; Didn't even know who was But her prayer &gt;&gt; drove brother Brham Brotherham. &gt;&gt; It is your faith. &gt;&gt; Don't blame the pastor. It is your faith should drive the gift in the pastor. Amen. say the truth. It drove brother Brham &gt;&gt; says sister heartlight say whatever you want &gt;&gt; and that day sister if you wanted to be a billionaire I would have become a billionaire immediately Faith &gt;&gt; is a long range vision. Those of us who have got faith, &gt;&gt; then we got we we don't need to see visions &gt;&gt; because we already got a vision. Amen. &gt;&gt; Faith sees what God wants to be done. &gt;&gt; Faith doesn't look at the present time. [Music] Faith doesn't see this here. Faith looks at what God wants. It sees what God wants. And what God has done, &gt;&gt; faith is a long range vision. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It doesn't lower it sight. &gt;&gt; It holds the target. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's a long length telescope. We are not looking here. We are looking there. Jesus. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Faith is our victory. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But the the attitude of so many people we are so much there's so much drifting. We are drifters. We just move along. until you are drifting about pastors, preachers, what just drifting. &gt;&gt; With the coming of the with the coming of the streaming now you stream that, you stream that and you start collecting your pastor because when you streaming you had something else. You're a drifter. &gt;&gt; No. No. No. How are you going to How are you going to walk along on the seats of remember? &gt;&gt; Driftwood &gt;&gt; is wood. A boat drift, you know, driftwood. It's like a tree which is just moving in water. It's wood, isn't it? A boat &gt;&gt; is wood. But the difference between a boat and driftwood, the driftwood doesn't have shape. The boat is shaped by the master and is powered by the master. Doesn't just move along with the water. The the boat moves with the power of the master. It goes where the master wants it to go. It doesn't just go and here a boat and a driftwood they are made of the same material. But the problem is the other one has got a master and the other one has got power from the master &gt;&gt; and is controlled by the power of the master and it does what the master says. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Uh hey my brother is &gt;&gt; um you know these things they come from parents &gt;&gt; because uh if your parents are rich &gt;&gt; then you're also rich. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Oh yeah. You even before you start working because you got a rich father and most of the times children of rich children fathers they become rich themselves. because they are born rich. They see riches. They see how they make rich. Most of times if you your parents were rich, [Music] I'm telling the truth. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; They go to rich schools. &gt;&gt; It runs in the family. &gt;&gt; So why do you want to leave miserable when our father is rich? If you're rich, you don't survive on a quart and coke. You survive on balanced diet. [Music] Yeah. Yeah. 39 my brother. 39. You don't survive on a quarter. You don't survive on a quarter. You survive. You eat the 30 poo.

Amen. &gt;&gt; Your faith &gt;&gt; goes into your son and your son should do better than you and those who follow should do better than them. That is why when they were coming of Egypt, God said these people are not doing well with the word. let their sons do it because he knew their sons will fulfill the word better than the fathers. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; We are living far with what we should have been living. We are living underprivileged. Because we are not holding on to our faith. We are living a million miles under our privilege. Tonight, privileges of Christians to be enjoying Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We have so much to enjoy [Music] &gt;&gt; under the revealed word of the hour. Remove fear. &gt;&gt; You are more than powerful. We need to be connected. &gt;&gt; The way a man was connected in the garden of Eden. I was going to choke it out, but I'm going to say man is omnipotent. You don't believe that? But he is a man fully surrendered to God is omnipotent. Amen. &gt;&gt; Mark 11 Mark 11 22 verse 22. Whatever say things you say and don't doubt in your heart it will come to &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What happens when two importants meet? &gt;&gt; Man and God coming together two ominants. Hey, something is going to shake. Something's going to shake. Amen. &gt;&gt; Which man? &gt;&gt; You and God. &gt;&gt; The two of you. &gt;&gt; If you can meet Hallelujah. Don't The power in you comes at taking God at his word. Brother, we we spend sleepless nights trying to figure out how we're going to do this, that, this, that. We just waited upon God. God will do something &gt;&gt; because God likes to display his power. God likes to bring you in trouble. He loves to put trouble down and see what you're going to do about it. So he just stopped at the lead sea. The next thing you know, they marched against that place and he sent Pharaoh after them. See how God likes to do it. He love to display his power. He is God. He just likes to show you who is [Music] Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The trouble today is people think that the days of the miracles are passed. But his word is here. The miracles needs to be here. God loves to manifest himself. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So we have faith. &gt;&gt; Faith is our victory. &gt;&gt; Faith overcomes. &gt;&gt; Faith is victory over death. &gt;&gt; Faith is victory over sin. Faith is victory over sickness. Faith is victory over worries. Faith is victory over frustrations. Faith is victory over the world. &gt;&gt; We shall overcome &gt;&gt; by the power of the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; You are an overcomer, my brother. Just come to church here. You know, if they going to make you a soldier, They tell you &gt;&gt; my brother uh come here. You're coming from home but you want to become a soldier. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; So they find such a those of you who are in the army know they find a person which is very very strong. They don't find a weakling. No, they find a strong. &gt;&gt; They say, "All of you who want to become soldiers, follow him. They find, hey brother, there are people there who can run like a horse. Most of them are in the army." So they say, "Follow him. He starts running. You think he stops going? &gt;&gt; 2 km &gt;&gt; 2 km &gt;&gt; 3 &gt;&gt; 3 &gt;&gt; 4 &gt;&gt; 10 &gt;&gt; 10 &gt;&gt; 15 &gt;&gt; 15 &gt;&gt; 20 &gt;&gt; 20 &gt;&gt; 25 &gt;&gt; 25 &gt;&gt; and they'll be coming behind. If you stop at 15, &gt;&gt; they say you have failed interview. If you stop here, you have failed interview. So some failed on baptism. We told them Yeah. Mhm. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yes, sir. Some failed failed on wearing of trousers. Women, we moved on. We never We never waited for them. We We'll be moving on. We'll never wait for you. &gt;&gt; This is the army. &gt;&gt; The major is the plant is running. You have to follow him. [Music] Do you know what happens when the measure is running in the front? &gt;&gt; He doesn't worry about those who are remaining behind. He knows that those who are going to be soldiers, they'll be following me. So whatever you fail, use your faith &gt;&gt; because faith is a conqueror. &gt;&gt; Faith is greater than your sin. &gt;&gt; Faith is an overcomer. Faith is isn't just just a pacemaker. [Music] &gt;&gt; Faith is a victory that overcomes the world. [Music] We are going to conquer this world. We are going to beat it down. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; It means &gt;&gt; that sin &gt;&gt; that once ruled you &gt;&gt; cannot rule you anymore. &gt;&gt; You whipped it. &gt;&gt; You are greater than your sin. Hallelujah. When you go home today, God then says, "Scare your sin." &gt;&gt; Sin. I'll be back. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Tell tell your sin. &gt;&gt; Hey, my brother, my sister, tell your sin. &gt;&gt; I'll be back. &gt;&gt; You're not surrendering. &gt;&gt; No, no, no. You're going back. After this, you're going to tell your sin, &gt;&gt; my friend. Maybe you beaten me today by tomorrow. I'll be back. &gt;&gt; You know when there's a fighter, &gt;&gt; he can fight a friend today. He's defeated. He goes home, &gt;&gt; does 100 press ups. He He He calls his friend, "You know, he defeated me, &gt;&gt; but I'm coming back. Tell your s you're coming back. Tell your sickness, you're coming back." Because faith knows no defeat. It cannot be defeated. &gt;&gt; Even death itself can't defeat it. It knows no defeat. &gt;&gt; Trials knows defeat, &gt;&gt; but faith knows no defeat. They not be defeated. &gt;&gt; And it is the only way you can please God. When you cannot know defeat when you fail, always come back more. Come back more. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Uh I don't know. I don't know where the football ground for S down is here in where is it? Which which side? &gt;&gt; Kemp. &gt;&gt; Kemp Park. Uh do you um those of you who live in Captain Park when Mamelo is winning you have to go and ask whether they are winning or not. I have lived near a stadium before in Malawi. I've lived near a stadium before. I don't even need to go there to know whether they are winning or not. No, from home I know that they are winning. &gt;&gt; Do you think that if M has won and the sun down in yellow would be this The first thing you will see is [Music] you know they are winning because that's what is there in the book of revelation. Revelation 17 tells us that that is on the sea of grass. They are singing songs of victory. &gt;&gt; So victory is a great word in English. &gt;&gt; The what is a great word in English. It means you have overcome the enemy. &gt;&gt; You are holding victory. &gt;&gt; We sing songs. and cheer in victory. &gt;&gt; One day, one day, &gt;&gt; one day &gt;&gt; it will happen that uh this body will just open up &gt;&gt; and I will start flying away. My brother that day John saw it &gt;&gt; and they cried victory. &gt;&gt; What has made us to overcome? &gt;&gt; Faith in his word. common faith things which we do as a child towards God. &gt;&gt; Don't try to supernaturalize faith. Brother says day faith that's what we need. &gt;&gt; We shall overcome. by the power of his word. &gt;&gt; We come here to church &gt;&gt; to build our muscles of faith so that we can pick up the sword which is the word and drive it to the heart of the enemy.
