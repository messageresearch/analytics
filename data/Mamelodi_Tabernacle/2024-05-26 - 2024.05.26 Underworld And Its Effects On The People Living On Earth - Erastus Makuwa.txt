Description:
Title: The Underworld and its effects on the people living on earth
Preached by Pastor Erastus Makuwa at Mamelodi Tabernacle on 26 May 2024

Proverbs 15:24 ; John 8:23; Phillipians 2:10
Ezekiel 29:1-3; Isaiah 23:1; Revelation 5:13; Revelation 9:11; Isaiah 5:17

The purpose of the sermon was to show the audience about the Underworld and its effects In the people.

God ordained that there will be a church in the last days  that the demons will not prevail against it. 

The following questions were addressed during the sermon: 
What is the underworld?
What is the relationship between the underworld and water? 
Does underworld have any relationship or influence on people living on earth 
What is happening there? People are initiated there . 
Why do people want to be initiated 
What do they use or do after initiations? 

Underworld is a place or dimension which is a world below the world.
The connection between the underworld and water is that water is the gate to the underworld.
There are creatures in heaven, earth and under the earth, you are influenced from where you come from. Sinners are influenced from below and believers are influenced from above. Your life is an evidence to confirm where you are influenced from. When you die you go back to where you were before. When you are used by Satan you are a dragon. 

People go to the underworld to connect and gain some power, Pastors, witch doctors, Bishops,Artists they all go to the underworld. Politicians are there to get power, Pastors are there to establish churches. They influence clothing industries, food, music and food. They influence men to love men, women to love women.

Who are the people who are initiated ? Men, women, business people, artists, boys and girls. 

Some people they go to church to cause division,and make other people to sleep.

Satan ambitions of building a better kingdom, than of God it is still there and he is still continuing working on it . 

The last ministry must be preached to the lost Sou...

to play them then one will interpret those uh testimonies after our brother will then will thereafter interpret those testimonies the first one is from Sister de she had a child that was sick and the elders prayed for her the second one is also from sister maluka she was sick and hospitalized and she wants to thank the pastor and the elders for the prayers so there is a noisy background [Music] just never mind the noise is behind but the testimonies are audible I will ask the brothers to play them God bless you Shalom brother pimpo okay again which means and then prayer I right after and then I'm prayer again brother for now right thank Hallelujah I'm just going to try to summarize it uh the sister said H she has a child at home by the name of Frida uh the child had blisters and then at the beginning they just thought it was just MOS mosquito bites and but then they there was water coming out of those blisters and then the child was taken to um the clinic and then she was given medication and then the medication did not work and they went for the second time and uh at the the clinic they told her that we do not have any medication that we can give to you uh because this is something that we cannot help you with so she then back she then went back home and then she went to see sister Ivon sister Ivon advised her that this is not uh something usual H it looks like it's something that was done to this child uh like I would say Witchcraft and uh they then decided to call Brother Harvest and then uh brother Harvest H prayed over the child and the child got healed slightly but then after that the child became worse and the incident h of the child cing the blisters it happened after they were visited by her a the sister's Aunt after the sister's Aunt H left then that's when they started to see this p on the child then after the brother har prayer and then the the child got healed but then it came back again and then it was a little bit worse and then the sister got a call from her aunt saying to her why are you exposing me so the sister started fighting H the aunt started fighting the sister she the sister said it was a spiritual kind of war or battle and then h brother harest then advised the sister to call brother M and brother M she's the sister met brother M here at church brother said call me when you at home and the sister got home called brother M as agreed and brother M prayed over the child on the phone and H the child and the brother reassured they that the child is now fine is completely healed I prayed the child will be we'll be okay and uh truly the child got healed H gradually she's now 100% the only thing that is left is just the max amen Shalom so so hour risk I brother for [Music] [Music] Hallelujah this one was a little bit faint so I didn't get pretty much everything but I will try to summarize the sister um in in short she said that she she had a problem sister maluka she was admitted at the hospital she was supposed to go for an operation she then advised the family members to call the K and they did that they called them K and the K came over the St could not walk could not talk she could not do anything she was just laying down flat on the bed and then sister brother K came over and prayed over the sister and the sister H instead of going for an operation she was actually in an ICU instead of going to an operation after the prayer she could not she did not go for an operation she was [Applause] healed God bless you Saints H sister maluka was informed that she has to be operated immediately and that the family must come and and sign the documents but the sister requested that they call the Elder and he prayed over the matter then just after that the doctors came and said we are no longer going to operate but we are going to give you some pills and she became unconscious for 3 days not able to talk not able to walk she was in the ICU then brother came with some elders and the day that Bram K came with the elders called the name of the sister in front of the family and the sister responded amen amen and they prayed for the sister and thereafter the sister started to recover that is the ministry of the seven SE that is the ministry of Pastor isra may the Lord richly bless you I have been requested to read greetings from Brother gabrielson the first one says God

the word that we have just read this word was written before the foundation of the world Hallelujah and Lord you have sent your spirit you sent men to write this word and you came and quickened that weight amen you said in the beginning was the word the word was with God the Word was God hallelujah and there was a man sent from the presence of the Lord and he was the light of the world Amen and

word of God the Living Word in our day father come again this morning to Quicken the word to find a Dwelling Place in our hearts we ask all this in the mighty name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen we may take our seats I'm going to just revise what you have already had [Music] or and I know if I know when my pastor comes here we will give it more flesh the topic will be on the world and its effect on the people living on [Music] Earth is going to be my topic this and um let me read some quotes from The Prophet here here in the book of The True Vine and a false Vine he says I'm approaching demons here you realize that I am not immune from them not by no means only the blood can protect me and I pray that God will grant that blessing tonight for his [Music] glory another one here he says from the book uh the Angel and the commission he says many times demons followed me in the [Music] room I have felt the fleshing me and bells and things [Music] and Haunt at me half the night nearly that is the power of the dark world and the prophet says here God ordained there would be a church in the last days and there can rise devils and demons and hypocrites but God will have that church because he said it will be there he will do it there is nothing that there is nothing that God is not able God is able of this Stone to rise children unto Abraham even if demons and Devils can rise up but God has ordained there will be a church that will that those demons will come against it but they will never [Applause] Prevail but that church will be there I'm going to go down with my message like this I'm going to answer these questions the first question will be what is on the world and the second question be the relationship between under world and the water and the third question will be are there people or creatures living there and the fourth one will be do this place do this place have any relationship or influence on the people living on Earth the fifth one will be what is happening there this one I can answer people are initiated there number six how how are people initiated there number seven what do people want to be why do people want to be initiated what do they do after what do they do or use after initiation amen can you flesh my sketch there there is the sketch there and the world and world is a place or a dimension [Music] or a region under the

read another book uh is an inment I'm going to read it it says here just below the region of mortal beings lays the realm of demon power one is the realm of mortal beings which is the earth the earth is the realm of mortal beings read Philippians my brother phpp chapter 2 verse 10 verse 10 Philippians chapter 2: 10 that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow of thanks in heaven and things in Earth and things under the Earth amen things reflected my brother again every KNE shall bow of things on earth in heaven and to the book of Philippians Paul says here he's preaching also about underwe he says there is a place under he says KN under will bow the region of The Mortals the region of the morals is the S is the well then under the region of The Mortals there is the region there is the is the under Paul says under the S when Jesus says to the Pharisees he says you you are from below amen or beneath Solomon solom in the Book of Proverbs it says the way of the [Music] wise wins [Music] upwards it wins upwards living living Below in other words there is Hell below there is three spheres there Heaven earth below that is what you call under world is is the world below our well now you know what under world is then um it is said water is the gate to the under that is the relationship read my brother read Exodus chapter um chapter 7 chapter 7 I believe so going to read the book of Exodus 7: 15 H chter 7 verse1 15 Exodus chapter 7 verse1 15 get the unto Pharaoh in the morning L he goeth out unto the water and thou shalt stand by the rivers Brink against he come and the rod which was turned to a seent shall thou take in thine hand God said to Moses go to the river before far get there in other words always went to the river when he faces some problem he to why he went there to inquire his God who dwells in the river Riv can you readel my brother sir can you the book ofel e chapter 29 eel 29 can read it from verse one ver one to three we shall three in the 10th

speak and say thus sayi the Lord God behold I'm against thee Pharaoh king of Egypt the Great Dragon of that lith in the midst of his river which has said my river is mine own and I have made it for myself what this what is far say there he says he dwells in the rivers and the rivers are his he has built them for himself who is speaking here is Satan in this man [Applause] far went to the river early in the morning because in the river there there was his God there he was just like Christians when we early in the morning we inquire from our God we want our God to direct to give us Direction and give us protection that is what far was doing but God said to Moses go before confuse him before he could start his things he must find you [Applause] there where are people who says there is no under world where are they let them ask [Applause] me the Bible says so the prophet say so I say so my pastor say so you say [Applause] so there is under world [Applause] there is connection between it and the water there was a certain man is my brother-in-law yeah my brother-in-law he is a traditional [Music] doctor he was just talking with elder didn't ask him he was just telling that he has he was initiated in the Water by a mate we didn't ask him he just told us he's still there if you want him I will take you to [Applause] him he said one day when he was he was working at we Bank when you

busy teaching people how tradition he started and he joined now for him to get he went there via the water he's also there you can ask him there is a connection between the water and read 5: Revelation 5 verse 13 and every creature which is in heaven and on the earth and under the Earth and such as are in the sea and all that are in them heard I saying blessing and honor and glory and power be unto him that Seth upon the throne and unto the lamp forever and ever amen there are creatures in Heaven There are creatures on Earth there are creatures under there are creatures in the sea that is what the Bible says creatures in heaven creatures creatures in the sea and under there is a connection between the sea and [Music] thew creatures there some are in initiated there some are waking there some are living [Music] there those creatures yes sir we have said um are there any relationship between the the world and the Sea the and we have said are there creatures in there the Bible says they are are you are you together the Bible says so you can say what are those creatures which are there because ACC the scriptures they are there and our prophets here in the book C 113

aent why isah called it and he also called it why because it is used by Satan that's why the Bible called the her why he was used by Satan because Satan is the Great Dragon when Satan uses you then
