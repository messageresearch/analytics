Description:
Title: The Angel With The Seventh Seal
 Preached by Pastor Israel Nkodima at Mamelodi Tabernacle on 31-12-2023

The pastor read the following scriptures: 

Revelation 21: 1-3 | Revelation 8:1

The Seventh Seal is the connection of all the mysteries of God.

The People can accept when you talk about a man, but when talking about an angel it is difficult for people to accept it.

As a child of God, you were born to show to the world who God is. If you are a child of God you know God and what He can do. An attribute is not something that is trying to do right but is a spiritual being in the form of God. A Child of God fits in exactly in the promises of God

The body of Christ is in the form of  pyramid. We going to a city that is in the form of a pyramid and the bride is shaped like a pyramid. 

The rapture is around the corner. The world is full of floods, and Science call it climate change, but it is what was predicted in the scriptures. Where Abraham was, there was no floods and there was no fire.

The pastor quoted the following spoken words:

63-0324E The Seventh Seal  Par: 276, 304, 406
57-0818 Time Tested Memorials of God Par: 98 - 106.

chapter 8 verse one I think if we have the last uh instrument on the panel is this scripture when he opened the seventh amen amen then that was all shall you read for us brother Revelation 8 verse1 and when he had opened the seventh seal there was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour amen amen well I can ask any brother here yeah amen let's see brother just say a prayer for us the brothers were saying there should be some mics for this place amen is that right amen yeah as you see in the other places we will still sit down and but let us bow our head before the brother came say a prayer would you mind to say I'll be ready when Jesus comes there's a mama with a child for dedication we have decided that immediately after the service we will dedicate the CH dedicate amen amen

amen yes sir [Music] am [Music] [Music] amen instument of the SE greater is he that is in us than the one who is in the world has catch up your presence last service amen you may be seated we are thankful I'm watching the time here so that I keep time that is remaining amen explain what what what was what explain um hey I'm looking I'm looking at something here that says here it is the one with the seventh [Music] SE okay amen that's what I am looking at now and it says now the seventh seal all all the mysteries of God the connection all the mysteries of God it's it's a connection of all the mysteries of God Amen that's why uh the others were opened but this one it was not open because it was for the end time when it's opened then then time is noal amen okay amen now I'm going to read in here page 558 58 uh you know you go everywhere B when the Bible is open David fought a great fight amen amen but when it comes to the end all the scriptures are connected to one scripture the scripture that closes so the seven the one that closes everything all right amen now I read here we reading and they were saying till today people we are every you go everywhere they will tell the seven seal is not open okay and but to those to others it is open and to others it is not open meaning there is those that it has been open and others it has not open to them all right amen now to them that to whom it is open they talk about it because to them it is open Amen to those that it is not open they don't talk about it because to them it's not open all right amen [Music] and now when it is open the seventh last when that one is open then it means your eyes are open amen not this eyes let me reach You Know M hearing about talking about a man when it goes to the end we realize it talks Of An Angel and but there's still people who are still behind when it's where it talks of amen amen but when you talk to a person a human being with a with about a person about a human amen amen it's easy amen human if you hope if you talk to a human being about an angel about an angel it becomes so difficult if I say the seventh angel messenger then still I'm talking about aen then people can accept that but if then if I talk about the Lord Jesus Christ who came and became a man he took that form to be like you and have pains feeling pains like you then the people could understand yeah he a man but before that he was a Spirit then they couldn't see him or know [Music] him then if you can't know him as a spirit you can't even know him as a [Music] man those who knew Jesus men like Peter the Samaritan woman they have known him so you have known him in order to know him that's the difference some people are still struggling to believe him let alone to know him because you can't believe somebody you don't [Music] know we believe him because we know him [Music] am uh today you have some people that are witches and that are what do you say to aen wizards Wizards amen amen now they don't know God because they have never seen God amen I was reading when I'm told in from that paper that so many people have sold their souls because they want money they want to be rich now they have never known or God let alone to understand God they don't believe that the end is coming you know a devil worshiper do not believe that there there will be an end to all in whatever he is involved in he believes that that is life but uh a child of God is a different being he knows that his time is short he is here just for a season you were born uh to reflect to show up who God is amen if you are a child of God you are born to show to the world who God is amen and his life all right amen every time you wake up in the morning the first thing you pray to God that's that's your life amen amen and I know that God will take care of me in everything uh this morning H I was one of my legs was this and that but I believed in God and said I'm going to the service because I'm a Child of God so that's why I'm here H you know if you are a child of God you know Goden and you know what God can do amen amen it's so wonderful to know what God can amen if you are a child of God a child means born of God he that is born of God does not [Music] say it doesn't say he who has repented he who has given himself to God says he that is born it is not a baby that decides his birth no so I have not decided to be born but it is God Amen that's right he gives birth to you it's not of your choice amen you can't choose to be born but God even I read where it says the Lord God gave birth to to in the books amen now if you are born of God and yet I'm looking at you you are a human but if you are born of God the body is [Music] human that's all just like everybody but the men inside is not human because the man inside was an attribute an attribute in God amen now every person who can sometimes think in this way that I am an attribute an attribute is not something trying to do good trying to be right no that's not an attribute an attribute is that a spiritual being born is in the form of God yet he is a man but inside of that man another man amen that's the difference uh that's why a child of God is not controlled by his senses no he is controlled by God am all right amen and you've heard me saying the people it's not the first time for the our neighbors here to say offer parking to your people but they don't even greet us it's not the first time but I tell you continue to how can they for to to greet them it's getting worse if they don't want us to they must just tell us amen amen should the person hear that who complained that the the people in this church they don't he end up saying I told you this is how these people are I'm trying to show you something all right but if a child of God that he feels bad that amen amen and he's the first one to go and say ah Mama I'm sorry for not greeting you maybe I did not see you or know you see the difference now this one is a child of God but another one and they canot for us to greet them now you see is that that Mama dealing with a mere human being not a child of God of course I've seen them who want to greet the people okay that is not our title now I read um it says let me start in that troes it's from God it fits exactly in the promises of God you know if you are a child of God you F in the promises of God from the End Amen of the message meaning you want get off because if once you are a child of if you are an African you are an African until the last day in the process you can try to die yourself always say sa sa whether you became White or you grow your hair until it hangs down Flor because to another African there's no way if you change die yourself do what else put highest heal but if you are a child of God you thank God for being amen that's right I'm I so thank God that I'm in Africa amen amen all right now let us look at this there is this part let me read for you and then we'll understand when all this are open an angel there is an angel of the Prophet the seventh angel messenger met an angel but he says the and the angel was very notable to me the rest of them just was seemed ordinary but this Angel was a notable Angel what does that mean you know in when the Bible says the in the inner man in you the notable one and you know you know that there is somebody in [Music] you that's why your nature there are some people with a very different nature you listen to the people talking hear every time he says I don't want anyone to talk anything with me then you you start being careful to you can't go far with this one meaning when he's talking to somebody he has drawn the line already when that somebody says something you see these are the things I don't want be careful when you talk to [Music] me who are you you are you God I'm talking about you know divine nature is not controlled by human amen it's divine amen amen amen people not because to you somehow amen that's why I've heard many times a brother saying brother has a demon now when that a brother told me did I cry no I just say I know he's my brother amen then after that I met him at a wedding the very same brother says demon you know I then I saw him at a wedding and uh I was coming his Direction he was coming my Direction so he was trying to go that way I said my brother amen amen it was like a [Music] lion it's like this you know we as a children of God people should approach you as a lamb that's why the Lord Jesus called the lamb the L of God Amen you've never heard him say I don't want anyone to to talk the way he likes all right amen you know I'm talking I know this kind of people be careful of what you say to me until you are afraid of communicating you know when you see a lion you can't say I will approach yeah Lord it will still div you calling it Lord a nature different Natures that's where the thing is different [Music] nature the brother was telling me hey Pastor we can't see you a certain brother who Stand by Your daugh ah you can't go [Music] in you still say he can't even give you a chance to amen Amen on my maybe explain and say and say Mercy on my no have mercy on my brother think take him as is take him when you go there go anything but just take him but we differ people we are different you find him having visitors now after a while those visitors are no longer coming if you go and ask them one by one hey I can't see you anymore they will tell you inire God bless you I'm I'm going to read something now in closing uh he came just as a prophet to everybody amen amen amen yes but later one okay but did you know that he is still talking about the same person you know if you can look deep inside of yourself you will know if you have changed from something to something because if you are going in the Rapture then you keep on [Applause] changing amen amen amen because already you have started amen just like a plant amen amen if it is whe it will start the mystery but the mystery of it which has got a body you first see the body amen amen then if you recognize it as the body of whe you expect whe at the End Amen just as if you are a child of God I expect you to be in the Rapture because that's what you are growing up amen all right amen now they say if you see wheat or any tree you know that the secret of his ground it's in the ground amen The Roots amen amen and uh you just see it coming but the secret you don't see amen amen amen just if you see a child of God spirit you don't see the secret but the secret is back there in the mind of God Amen The Roots the attribute the root of who you are was there in the mind of [Applause] God then from being attribute to the amen amen then you are born of men amen but after then you you accept the Lord because that's what the root the nature of the root am you know if you want to know anything or deal with anything you must look first at the RO what it is if it's a child of God then you deal with him as a child of God but you must go to the root first amen if it's not a child of God you can preach and preach it won't help amen we've been preaching here we the young people with their cell phones we all have cell phon but a child of God can control himself he will use it amen amen for a good cause you find somebody that's why they are always in secret because he knows that he is using it for all right in secret You Preach to him teach him it won't work because it is his nature you can't beat your nature you know that nature yeah all right if you meet a lion you know the nature of a lion you won't say let me try this one maybe this one one is [Music] converted they tell you even don't TR trust a Ted life [Music] at school they used to tell us about a lion no a man who met a lion it was just a fable then they to told us it was in a book yeah that this man knelt down seeing a lion coming then he thought I can't outrun this lion there's no way and it has seen me already the best thing is for me to pray running on nothing amen amen so he KN down to pray oh lord it's a lion I'm just a man I know I don't stand any chance then very then when he arrived and say Amen amen he realized the lion was also praying but only the mistake he made he didn't hear the utterance the prayer of the because it was saying Lord thank [Music] you you feed me I don't go without food even now just by surprise so he didn't listen to the prayer he stood up and say I I found a a repented lion and then he wait even waited for for it to say Amen are you also a brother this man I didn't know that you are a Christian he says that's that's my my nature I I learned this that when God gives me food I pray before I eat amen amen all right amen now let us finish this the prophet God's angel later he changed something about and started to talk about the not one you know there should be somebody in you the notable one so that you too can say there's another being in and he said the rest of them seemed ordinary all this other Angels seven angels amen amen but he was looking at the notable one you know even here in the service you are looking at somebody who believes the message in you there is somebody who believes the actually not only believe but he is the message amen the notable one the rest were ordinary but this Angel was not he was to my left in the constellation in the form of a pyramid because we are coming to the pyramid the city we are going to is in the form of a and the body of Christ is in the form of a pyramid now yourself you are part of the pyramid amen amen part of the building uh I think we've got that what do you call it we just displayed it we are coming to it it shows the church in the form of the pyramid which is the bright
