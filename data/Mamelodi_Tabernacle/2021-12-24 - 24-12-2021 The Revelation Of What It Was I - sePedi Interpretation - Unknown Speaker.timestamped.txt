[0:57] there's a reason eastward
[1:10] he went
[1:43] [Music]
[2:03] [Music]
[2:08] that's when god came to drive them out
[2:11] of the
[2:13] garden they went oh so
[2:17] is it
[2:18] for everybody
[2:48] then there
[2:58] worship god just at the gate
[3:16] it was in the heart of men wanting to go
[3:19] back
[3:27] amen now
[3:29] so that's why okay
[3:34] [Music]
[3:59] due to illusion
[4:04] they came to the altar
[4:06] but they raised the denomination
[4:11] and then
[4:39] knowing that it is blood that did it in
[4:41] the garden
[4:45] now it will take blood
[4:49] to return
[4:51] away that is the revelation it has
[5:08] because
[5:42] [Music]
[5:53] [Music]
[6:13] which we have
[6:15] had
[6:31] that which we have heard
[6:36] from the beginning
[6:39] now if you have heard it from the
[6:41] beginning
[6:45] [Music]
[6:46] this john
[6:50] he
[6:51] positioned himself
[6:56] as
[6:57] one of them
[6:58] who heard him speak
[7:00] anger
[7:14] [Music]
[7:28] you will
[7:35] the thing that we believe is the thing
[7:38] that we have believed
[7:42] is
[7:43] [Music]
[7:56] no
[8:24] okay
[8:35] that
[8:36] we have
[8:40] which we have
[8:42] seen with our
[8:44] eyes
[8:48] what
[8:51] that's why you can't
[9:06] but in here there was something very
[9:09] very special
[9:16] prostitute in jail
[9:20] what is
[9:48] and speaking
[9:51] from
[9:53] inside of
[9:54] her heart
[9:58] [Music]
[10:01] now once a person says i know
[10:07] don't try to argue with him
[10:13] because she says
[10:25] [Music]
[10:31] you can argue with the person who
[10:33] doesn't know but not the one with the
[10:35] one who knows
[10:44] now watch i knew uh
[10:53] maybe somebody would say you are a
[10:55] prostitute
[10:56] um
[11:07] [Music]
[11:24] a prostitute knowing that the messiah
[11:29] [Music]
[11:40] they didn't know
[11:52] the prostitute said i perceive that
[11:55] [Music]
[12:05] because you told me all the things that
[12:08] i have done
[12:26] [Music]
[12:36] messiah
[12:40] amen amen and so now
[12:44] uh
[12:44] [Music]
[12:45] let's come down to this
[12:50] now this is the gate
[12:54] they came out
[12:56] he
[12:57] drove them out
[13:01] then they started to worship there at
[13:03] the gate well thomas
[13:16] they came here to worship god at the
[13:20] gates
[13:32] we know how god now
[13:38] um
[13:59] i read here
[14:25] [Music]
[14:51] and they showed us the place where
[14:54] the prophet stood before
[15:09] you know we have spoken it even before
[15:15] that
[15:16] restoration
[15:19] is when god would restore
[15:25] if there was a sword there at the gate
[15:27] then god is asked to restore that sword
[15:30] back to the gate
[16:21] you know how there was a gap today
[16:27] yeah we were trying to show here very
[16:30] like
[16:31] after adam
[16:33] forfeited the the book
[16:46] i tried to talk about it somewhere but
[16:49] it didn't work
[16:50] [Music]
[16:55] at the gate
[16:58] after
[16:59] camera
[17:00] after
[17:01] adam forfeited the
[17:28] [Music]
[18:31] [Music]
[18:54] standing in
[19:08] [Music]
[19:22] because
[19:36] the angels
[19:52] [Music]
[19:57] can you take have this
[19:59] so
[20:00] to show something
[20:01] in closing here
[20:04] that's the pyramid keeper media
[20:07] right
[20:08] there it is
[20:10] oh yeah let me turn around yeah
[20:13] that's the pyramid keep it immediate
[20:44] foreign
[21:25] [Music]
[21:26] the ministry will be ready
[21:38] foreign
[21:44] like we said last time
[21:46] yeah why why the people don't see the
[21:49] seventh season
[21:55] it is because
[22:08] now the people haven't seen that angel
[22:10] with the seventh seal
[22:16] all right
[22:20] if you are
[22:22] if you are winding big
[23:20] which
[23:35] [Music]
[23:49] the it is in the spoken way people spoke
[23:51] in the day
[23:52] you know when these things
[23:56] are preached by the sons of god
[24:04] uh
[24:05] really no one will understand them
[24:14] peter
[24:16] peter
[24:18] [Music]
[24:30] my
[25:40] not this eyewitness
[25:42] is so fast
[25:46] amen
[25:48] coming down
[25:50] having seen
[25:52] moses
[25:54] whatever
[26:22] these three guys
[26:27] they'll tell you that you have seen
[26:29] moses
[26:34] amen now
[26:35] the message
[26:38] is now getting more deeper
[26:42] to confuse the people
[26:46] for the people who were there
[27:17] [Music]
[27:28] he never said i got so confused
[27:43] so it was not for their first time to
[27:45] meet
[27:46] uh
[28:00] you wonder because you don't you are not
[28:03] aware that you met them before
[28:06] my god
[28:11] in that cycle of eternity
[28:37] [Music]
[28:43] said where shall we go
[28:48] amen amen but
[28:50] because they were together
[28:53] so where shall we go
[28:56] for the words
[29:10] words before what i would remind you of
[29:13] what really believes
[29:17] he has met him before
[29:20] feeling to him is the sound of the words
[29:23] of eternal life
[29:32] [Music]
[29:39] still hear you
[29:42] because
[29:44] these are the ways of eternal life
[29:50] it's not just a ceremony
[29:53] you
[30:18] [Music]
[30:20] oh
[30:33] expect to see us
[30:47] we have eternal life
[31:02] if the people threatened me with death
[31:08] it doesn't bother me because say wasn't
[31:10] saying
[31:12] god told bunny i shall not die
[31:31] i'll be so thankful because within a
[31:33] second i would be somewhere else
[31:42] do you fear death now
[31:56] because death is just a passage for us
[32:26] is he
[32:43] [Music]
[33:09] and that's when stevens thought that
[33:12] it's my time to to to go
[33:15] we are like
[33:18] our recipe
[33:20] and the body
[33:21] mainly
[33:51] yours for you anchor for where now you
[33:54] are that soul well
[33:57] so real heaven opens up
[34:07] [Music]
[34:16] you know i
[34:17] hope as we said
[34:20] god loved it
[34:24] he knocked so much
[34:31] and the bible says god just took him
[34:35] in the form of jesus
[34:43] job pleased god so much until god
[34:46] decided just to take him once
[34:55] and god
[34:59] he will get so happy with us
[35:25] because if i look back
[35:41] there was no grave there
[35:52] [Music]
[36:24] yeah
[36:26] okay some
[36:29] somebody will ask
[36:33] as
[36:34] some people think like that
[36:42] [Music]
[37:21] dynamics
[37:30] if you put a thing like this
[37:33] on a day and somebody can
[37:48] is
[37:59] to
[38:00] make it easier for
[38:02] the
[38:22] they put me in the pyramid of themselves
[38:44] those
[39:10] [Music]
[40:08] and
[40:50] that's what confuses
[41:04] became
[41:32] of angels in
[42:03] [Music]
[42:17] because it is until the devil is pushed
[42:21] down the bottomless pit
[42:23] he won't fix tell us
[42:26] himself
[42:55] but they come to church and even
[43:08] foreign
[43:24] foreign
[44:05] foreign
[44:14] [Music]
[44:18] moses
[45:05] do you believe that
[45:06] then they came up with a list of
[45:09] seven of them
[45:15] who came to the church
[45:30] hey
[46:12] one day the lord willing
[46:24] the people you'd expect to be christians
[46:40] god has given us the eyes to see them
[46:43] do you want to feed them
[46:47] even to talk to them
[46:50] even to talk to them during the middle
[46:52] of the night
[47:05] let me stop right there
[47:21] jesus
[47:36] hey
[47:50] h
[48:01] [Music]
[49:03] the devil cannot win against us
[49:09] because
[49:10] before they can kill bewitch him
[49:17] [Music]
[49:28] but
[49:51] [Music]
[50:02] [Music]
[50:10] huh
[50:36] that's why every time we hear that this
[50:38] and this

[53:11] because he has given him the
[54:08] but in the midst
