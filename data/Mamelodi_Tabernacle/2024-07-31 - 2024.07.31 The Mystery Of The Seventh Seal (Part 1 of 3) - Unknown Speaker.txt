Jews and the Seven seal is for the Gentiles all right yeah thank you for helping now I read Feast of the trumpets this is page 28 here in the English version paragraph the second paragraph two the prophet says the seven seal the seven temp to the Jews so okay okay okay okay I have to pass this one the seventh trumpet is to the Jews okay then I read again here page 23 under the seven trumpet is to Israel the same as the SE was to the church [Music] the seven trumpet is to the to [Music] Israel and the seventh seal to the [Music] church so we have the Jews each of them is revealed by a SE that's why today we are not church we are the brid because the SE the seven seal revealed the bride the seven Church ages is a church is twis says every Church age brings twins the [Music] SE one remain one is taken in amen the one taken in uh is revealed by says the bright is the revealed church if it's not revealed it is just the [Music] church if it's revealed it is the [Music] Bri that's why we have Jesus and we have Christ the revelation of God Jesus is not a mystery the myy is [Applause] Christ not [Applause] [Music] [Applause] so the man in Genesis Witham always the myy is [Applause] [Music] [Applause] inside now here brother says of the trumpet [Music] 22 he says let me say this right here that every trumpet [Music] blow because the seven seal there was silence no one knew that was the minute or hour that Christ would come the Bible says no one will know the [Applause] father now no one knew who Jesus was then he asked and said who do you say I the son of am and he said th and the Lord Jesus said that's a revelation [Music] Peter flesh and blood not revealed to you so in the last days no man will it to you but the Father the Bible says even the know the Bible says even the son don't know [Music] comus Christ has left the sanctuary and then we come in as the [Music] sons the son was when Adam fell God came and took the place of Adam in the form of the [Applause] not himself he came in as a [Music] substitute because that place is the place of men God came and took the place as aute the form ofus when God had put some with a sword to the way of the Tree of Life no man could go back until the place is redeemed it was until God redeemed brother then [Music] he now as a redeemed Adam had the brook when he fed the book God took it and drove him out of the out of the East Gate says now we have seven angels lead back to the because we are going back so the seven angels are leading back to the again after red God gave that to guarding the way of the Tree of Life it waset soet no one could come there without first being redeemed and the to go back Hallelujah so the seven seal opened the gate that was in the of when he received it it was like sword in the later when when it so theam that is the seven which is the Mar certificate of the without this seven s book you are not married amen you have a certificate you have a certificate uh the Bible says the Lord Jesus stood up and took the book Because when he died he went back and became a mediator until we are all to take our positions we had no right to to open the book as we were in a fallen State now God had to redeem us because our Nam were in the to receive and until we qualify the marriage officer supp us with the ISS that's why they will say the seven seal is revealed then they take because this is the revelation of the seven s so it's not the grou for the people with sixs a church with six seals must produce their six seal book this one is seven now Revelation chter 5
