Rev 13: 11 - 14

The revelation of Melchisedec also happened after the church ages. The revelation of the seals happened after the Church ages, the partaking of the hidden manna and the manifestation of the sons of God also happened after the church ages. All these things have already happened.

The king send people to call the people inside the wedding ceremony. When they have called people into that house and when the calling and the preaching is over, then the king came in.

The coming of the king is the manifestation of Revelation 10. When the king comes in he did not stop talking. When he came in he found one without the garment and ask how he came in without the garment. The coming of the ki...

think next time because I believe every uh will come here every every Christmas we must go there amen then the people here they must start looking for the best place which will accomodate us all and I believe that side will do the looking for the place to accommodate ACC us all God bless you all I'm I'm going to just you see when the the game is coming to [Music] play there are what you call cutting razors I'm the one because the game is coming then I'm just doing some cutting razors here for theor my pastor is still coming um while standing on our feet my brother here will read Revelation chapter 13 11 to 14 11 11 14 amen hallu and I beheld another Beast coming up out of the earth and he had two horns like a lamb and he spake as a dragon and he exerciseth all the power of the first Beast before him and cth the F and them which dwell therein to worship the first Beast whose deadly wound was healed and he doeth great wonders so that he maketh Fire come down from heaven on the earth in the sight of me and deceiveth them that dwell on the Earth by the means of those Miracles which he had power to do in the sight of the Beast saying to them that dwell on the earth that they should make an image to the Beast which had the wound by a sword and did live yes let us pray our dear heavenly father thank you thank you for giving us this privilege I and my brother we are standing here in your place humbly we are besing thee to come and use our voice to deliver what you want to be delivered today to your children amen I pray asking in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen amen you may take your seats the topic I have here is incidences which takes place between the seven age and the incidents which takes place there before the mar this is two because yesterday I pre before the marriage ceremony which is called the married supper after the seven Church ages the following things will happen and some have already happen the ration of the son of man but it happened after after the seven Church age it didn't happeny because according to our Prophet each messenger comes at the end of that age in other words came at the end of the first church age the messenger come at the end to call people out of that church age then in other way now the seventh angel messenger came at the end of the seventh church when he came when the church age was over he was calling people out of the church [Music] age what happened all those things which happened there they happened after the revelation of the son of man we know that between the between the Son of God and the son of David there must come the revelation of the son of man and the Son of God dispensation is seven Church ages the son of man is to be revealed he must be revealed after after the dispensation of the Son of God which is the seven Church ages this revelation of the son of man happened after but between before the marriage supper another thing which happened there is the rising of the evening light the rising of the even light also happened the after because the the rising of the sun rising of the evening light is to the son of man and also the revelation of all those things happened after the revelation of the seals all those things happened after the partaking of the Hidden man those things happened after and then the the manifestations of the sons of God all those things happen the after The Binding of the testen after now before after those things The Binding of the test manifest of the sons of man of God Tak of the Hidden man revelation of the seven sees ration ofc rising of the even light the revelation of the son of Son of Man all those things has already happened amen but there is only one which must happen before Mar supper is the squee that must happen that must happen it must happen before and another one is the rapture the Rapture must happen after and before am are you together with us yesterday we spoke about the king coming in because after the King has instructed the servants to go and call people then when they have called the people inside the marriage ceremony inside that house then when all the preaching and the calling was over the king came in then we preached about that yesterday because the king came after all those happen and this all when the coming of the king there is the is is is the it's the manifestation of the or the revelation of Revelation chapter [Music] 10 is the coming of the king and the King came after and when the king came in there he didn't came in and stop and and stop not talking but he came in and spoke because he somebody there who was not on a wedding gar he said to that one how did you come in here but the coming of the king brought the separation and the coming of the Revelation chapter 10 has brought has brought the separation just like John John's last message it was to introduce the Lamb of God it was John's last message but his last message which introduced the Christ the Lamb of God brought separation because some believe that he has come but some he didn't believe that he has come that message brought te and the message of the revelation of the Revelation chapter 10 it also brought PE the message of the revelation of the seven SE it has also brought the message of the third pool it has also brought ke there are those who believe that the seven SE is revealed and there are those who believe that it is not revealed and even among those who say it is revealed some of them they some of them don't know what is the seven se but they say it is that it has brought separation that is that is where we are now because the King has come because the King has has come in am what are we waiting for is for the celebration to start because now they are in the house from the first church age my oh let's let's just go [Music] sometimes it brings something good or sometimes brings Perfection because before you can enjoy the juice of the orange you must the when you haveed the orange then you can enjoy the juice from the let me read let me read something for you here I'm going to read these books and finish just going to read and read and read then after reading I stop let me read something here this book is called I [Music] know it says here page paragraph 733 but today I know it was all working for my good I know the life had to be and and to get what it is to get what is in out there was too much of BR in there he had to be squeezed out before God could make make himself [Music] known there was too much of you there are there is too much of you in you God had to squeeze it out because your first enemy is not me or your you must be squeezed out so that God can have part in you oh let me let me go there was too much of you in you want to squeeze it out through trials and while that squeezing was coming on it is hot but after a while the skies clear back then you see the purpose of God this little Tri things are just for a moment they fade and pass away but are only done for your good let us remember that after the squeeze we are made perfect we we are established we are strengthened we are settled no more unstable after the squeeze amen squeeze bring something [Music] something it is written in one of the scriptures in the Bible that trials trials are brought upon us are more precious to us than gold itself for it is God giving us these trials after we have become his property after our confession after our baptism and our promise to walk in life for [Music] him every child that comes upon us is to perfect us is is to bring us to a place where God can make himself more real to [Music] us than before than before the trials in other words trial bring us closer to God than before the trial before the children of Israel come out of Egypt to go to their promised land they have to be squeezed because some have has already occupied some places in the government so they must be persecuted they had to be Dagen out of those position they must go back to work said you must help these people you must give them wood to bend These Bricks originally they were given Woods their work their work was to make bricks after theyve made bricks they were given wood to bur those bricks [Music] they given they were given a target for a day so that they must make so much bricks then far said these people are making noise in my my ears because they don't have work take them out of thees they must go there and and make bricks then you must not give them Wood anymore they must make bricks they must go and look for wood they said humbly we shall go on doing bricks go on giving us wood said no no no you must look for wood now the coming of Moses make their work tougher it was the squeeze it was the squee squeezing Egypt out of them their suffering was squeeing Egypt out of them so that they can be ready to go amen there must come something so that you can be ready to go so that they it must take out the world out of [Applause] you before they could see God in flesh among them before they could see the in visible visible they before they could see the power of God over the fire they were squeed F they were forced to bow to the image they were forced you must bow to the image or you face the fire they said our God has power to deliver us out of that fire but even if he cannot deliver us even if he does not deliver us that doesn't mean he doesn't have power he has power over your fire but even if he does not Deliver Us from your fire but your but your will never bow down to amen before they could see God manifested among them they had to go go through the [Music] S you must not forget that that thing happened at the beginning of the Gentile [Music] dispensation it was at the beginning of the Gentile dispensation and we are told by the prophet that at the end of the gentle dispensation this thing must happen again because the idol there it was the image of a holy [Music] man it was the image of a holy man and the holy man wasel NE believed that his God has gone into this man this man here is not a is not just only a man is my God in this man he named Daniel Bela is the name was the name of Nebuchadnezzar Scot when he said let's make an image he was making an image of Daniel according to him you see when we come to idolatry people who made some images they think that looks like that Nez when he made the image he looked at he said my looks like this man so we must make when we make the image we must make the image of this man hallelujah hallelujah look how he saw the image now remember the image now this is a home place now that is what the prophet says he says this is a home place now and I'm also the same this is a home place I believe that the image the King Nebuchadnezzar made was of Daniel a holy [Music] man when was making image he was making an image of Daniel a holy man but now remember I John was making a prophecy he says there will come a beast that Beast will come out of the out of the land the first Beast came out of the water but the Beast which came out of the land John says it it said to people they must make an image of the f and that image was called the World Council of churches in our it was a prophecy then even our prophet he he talk about it coming let me read something here perhaps in this book I said I'm going to read this book and close this one is right let me read this one is IND doors I'm going to read this one um yeah I'm going to find what I want to read here amen it says here now brother sister we have went through a cold spell in the church that is right a lot of religious trft has are in the church that is right a lot of religious [Music] draft has come through everybody and has called every has and a lot of people had got their eyes all closed and there is a big World Council of churches when that says let's make an image and that image is the World Council of churches the prophet says is coming is going to force everyone of you into it the prophet is talking about it coming how is it going to come how is it going to be formed let me read for you something here and in this book Seven Church ages I I I also will keep thee from the hour of Temptation which shall come upon all the world which will come upon all the world so try them that dwell upon the Earth this verse is not a declaration that the true church will go into and through tribulation if it meant that it would have said it but it said I will keep thee from the hour of Temptation this temptation exist like the Temptation in Eden it will be a very inviting proposition it will be a very inviting proposition held up in direct opposition to God's commanded [Music] way when you are listening to this proposition it will be so enticing but it will be again it says yet from the standpoint of human [Music] reasoning it will be so very right so enlightening and lifegiving to fool the we only the very elect will not be foed the Temptation will come as follow the ecal move that has studed on what it seems such a beautiful blessed principle fulfilling Christ prayer that we all might be one when they are proposing to to come with this thing they Jesus said we must all be one so that so we must make a union like of the churches to fulfill the scripture so that we can be all we can all be one then she says when this principle become so strong politically that she be pressure upon the government to cause all to join with her either directly or through adherence to the principle inacted into [Music] law so that no people will be recognized as an actual Church unless under direct or indirect they did the same they did the same during Jesus time the churches turned him down [Music] first then when theyve turned him down then they go to the government so that the government can help them because they don't have power to declare him dead or to to kill him the power to kill only comes from the government but after the churches have turned down these churches they have turned the word down they have already they already the word down but what is what is remaining now they they will ask the government to formulate a law so that the government can formulate a law that will force all all churches belong to this Union and if they don't belong to that Union then you will never be allowed to have a church like this never have never allow to preach you never allow to give Comfort to the people who need comfort they are still they still they are still going to ask the government and they on the way now was there was something a certain woman was leading a certain campaign you know that woman calling people to register how if you are a pastor you must tell them how you become a pastor about that It justor Go it is leading to The [Music] Squeeze when they when they have AG when they have all agreed this thing is is it is building up to the squeeze and when the squeeze takes place it will be called a harvesting Mach why this qu comes because the weat has already matured the already R there no way separate the weat from the Shar there ex except the harves machine and this go on sleeping go on sleeping but is coming [Applause] amen it is called the harves let me read something it says here that is what the man of God says [Music] here about this says but thank God the grain is going the grain is going on gra the prophet says the grain is already ripen but it must stay in the presence of the [Music] son the Pres of the is the word of am when we talk about the we talk about the for that system that is the word the word of this season is the manifestation of the PO is the operation of the seven SE the we must stay in that presence to be rened because the revelation of the seven [Music] seed his work is to ripen the seed the prophet and if that is true by the of God where we are living in that is true by Nature indicated the corn of whe everywhere in other words how much longer we got you know what I hear the coming of the Kumai coming hearing the sound of it coming the we of ches is a hares he says I'm hearing the sound of it to separate she will separate it what does she do shave her of her stock but she has got an El waiting for her what is the elevator the elevator is the rapture when the combine is is catching the is harvesting the wheat the elevator is here is to take the [Applause] whe let me what the prophet is saying here but she's got the elevator waiting she she will go home one of these morning oh yes you understand what I say says [Applause] amen the elevator is the rapture the squee when the squeeze Comes The Rapture is here let me every Church age it was the age [Music] of listen listen every messenger he he goes there go the prophet says each AG has El and to pick those El from that AG God send a messenger it's just like a magnetic because there are magnetic substances there you just you just bring the magnet there all the magnetic substance will come there but you must remember my brother there are some semi magnetic substances they are magnetized but to a certain degree magnet comes for the first time they will raise a little bit and go down and when magnet comes for the second time they W because the power of the the first magnet coming has taken that power message went on First and now it is coming for the second time but the power of the message when it comes the first time some people when up a little but they went down but when message comes now I'm not I'm not where I used to be in 1976 I am somewhere a higher place than that place if this message come back to the people who I was with during the time at that time we we moved up when the message we moved up but when the message goes away he went back down every Church age it was the age of the rapture the messenger there he took the the Rapture material says then lays that messenger with that group keep that messenger and lay them [Music] down another they they are sleeping in the Rapture place when he put them there they are already in the together there then we go to age and we they come they come they come just like when the the king sent Messengers to [Music] go go and call the people when they call the people they come there they put on the Garment they get inside waiting for the the ceremony to start those who are in the house are already participant of that ceremony they came there put on the Garment and wait for the ceremony to start all the people from the first church age who died in the message The Messengers they are there waiting for us who are leaving here but they already in the aane waiting for the aane to move they are already inside they they sleep inside the aane which is the rapturing aerplane they are sleeping in that astronaut [Applause] amen but this time waiting for the squee there you see the seat SE it stages said when I plant the seed it must germinate when it germinate it's not something that I planted there it's a different thing but the life of the thing that I planted is in that thing you see there if you kill that thing you are killing the the seat is going up until it will be the SE again the end there amen it was the full SE even now this thing called squee it is there in an infancy [Music] stage those who can see they can see that is then when when then you when the squeeze comes is then when you will see the full operation of the thir what the prophet says let me read something here all right let me read this book I said now I'm about to read the last one let me all let me read this one this one says it says now that great gift others I have tried to explain others and say how it was done this can be explained just wait it will not be in operation so now wait till that councel of churches brings all that that is when it will happen me it it says now remember there will never be an impersonation of that because it can be it cannot be it is inexistent and I I I am war of this right at this time now it's just happened so it could identify his presence among you it is happening among you is identifying his presence among you I am here just say I am here he says it just happened so it could identify it presence among you see but it will not be used in a great way until this cancel begins to tightens up [Music] and when it does is when the when the PC and so forth can almost impersonate [Music] everything but this one cannot be done but when that time comes when that sque comes down then you will see what you have seen manifested in
