should I what time okay F let's uh open up the book of uh open open our Bibles in the Book of Luke Luke 23 then we will read from verse uh 46 23 lukah chapter 23 verse 46 and 47 ver 46 and 47 may the Lord bless you amen and when Jesus had cried with a loud voice he said father into thy hands I command my spirit and having said thus he gave up the ghost now when he when the Centurion saw that what was done he glorified God saying certainly this was a Rous man amen okay my brother can you just pray let us pray gracious Eternal Heavenly Father once again here we are Lord Almighty we approach your throne of Mercy we approach it with Thanksgiving oh god father there is nothing that we can present at this moment father that through it we can say we are worthy to stand here but father We Just Surrender Our lives our body Soul and Spirit unto you father here is your servant our Elder he has already read a scripture father we know any man who is able through intellectual he can read this scripture but what we are expecting now father it is your spirit to come and Quicken the way that has been read father so that we can all together with the family found find comfort from this word that has been read so father we commit the speaker of your word this evening we commit everyone who's in here so that father all of us we can be in one Accord so that your spirit can flow we bind all the spirits because we know father every time when your children are gathered together the evil one always come but this evening we say father that he doesn't have any in Roots in here because father we are all of us together in one Accord our hearts are looking unto you so there's no channel for him as we commit the reading of the word and the message that we going to receive now into your hands in Jesus Christ's name amen amen you may be seated God bless [Music] you okay we are at the funeral here of our sister of which I believe all of us knows him knows her yes we've heard some testimonies about her which is is wonderful let's that's why I'm reading here about our Lord Jesus Christ because our Lord Jesus Christ he came here not to show [Music] off but he was here to fulfill the we and manifest the We There were prophecies about him uh prophets like Isaiah they said virgin shall then and bear a son now he was bringing that testimony that I am that son and Isaiah said uh and his name Shall be Called wonderful comfor so he was comforting people then Isaiah said was the Everlasting father are we together so now he came to fulfill all those so now each and every one of us that we are here uh the Bible says uh in the book of Colossians one you read verse 16 it says by all things were created by Him all big and small things visible and now when he created those things he created even kingdoms and principalities he created them for himself so now we are all here because we created by him and then actually we're here to manifest uh the prophecies each and every one of us there is a prophecy that is directed to him now our Lord Jesus Christ one day he he took the Bible of that time which was called a scroll and open it and find where the Bible speaks about him then he read it and then he said to them this day the scripture is fulfilled now he was said this scripture is talking about me now the Bible says they look at him they said is this not the son of John and Mary and whose brothers we know so now when you manifest the We There is a natural birth from your parents there's a supernatural bed that that that comes from eternity now we read here verse 47 ver 47 46 verse 46 says and when Jesus had cried with a loud voice he said father into thy hands I command my spirit the day was baptized a spirit descended upon him a spirit descended upon him and when he was in the cross he said I command the spirit back to you now we know that now we are body we are Spirit we are [Music] souls and then when time comes that these three separates each and everyone take it own Journey so now the Bible says those that come from eternity they will go back to Eternity are we together because they were processed from the heart of God and when they were processed From The Heart Of God which means they come from the soul of God so now they become the minor gods they become the God one day they said to our Lord Jesus Christ you've been beating about the bush tell us exactly who you are he said I told you and you didn't [Music] believe and then he even said to them of all the things that I've done and you want to Stone me which one just show me those things they said no you did Miracles we don't Stone you for that you did good things you walk upon the sea multiplied bread you ra the dead for that we don't Stone you but the reason that we should Stone you you are a human being and you make yourself God now what we should remember is that as long as you haven't reached [Music] that Dimension where you will reflect God then you are not that that ready it must come a time where people would say you are a human being and you make yourself called because they'll be seeing the god that is in you but with no understanding that a human being can be God right now he said he gave back the spirit when you you you you depart you gave back the spirit where it comes from and the Soul goes back where it comes from the body goes back where it comes from now the Bible says Flesh and Blood shall not inherit the kingdom of okay I want us to continue so now when he he gave back he says when the Centurion saw what was done he glorified God right amen saying certainly this was a ious man when he saw him dying giving the ghost out now let's read Matthew remember we are here on Earth just to manifest the word of God are we are we together amen apart from that there's nothing that we are here for we are just temporary just to manifest that what the prophetes says the Bible says the nature is groing gring for what gring for the manifestations of the sons of God because the Son of God Adam was in charge was in control of the nature was in control of all the creatures of he would say to that mountain move who said to that River this direction he will call things into existence now in our time the Bible says our Lord will come as a thief in the night he said he will come as a thief in the night right there is coming and appearing it doesn't say he will appear as a thief in he will come as a thief in the what if I say to you he has already he has already came in the form of the revealed word because when the word is revealed to you the Bible says in the book of First John 3 ver9 it says a child of God does not sin because the SE the seed of God remains in him the seed of God remains in him what is the seed of God the seed of God is the word of God and when word of God is in the child of God then it germinates the word of God by the way the Bible says in the beginning was the W the W was with God the Word was God are we together the Word was God right now if the word of God is a seed then when it finds a place because in uh John chapter 8 verse 37 our lord said to the phes you want to kill me or you said you are a Seed of Abraham but you want to kill me because my words cannot find a place in you so now when you are a Believer you believe the word of God When You Believe in the word of God then when it reaches you then it start germinating building a watch building another body which will never die building another Bo where in your heart right amen and then when it builds that body and that body grows until it becomes Christ you must know now that Christ is the Son of God and Jesus is the son of God now Christ Jesus is is a place where the word which is christs in the difference between Jesus and Christ is that Jesus is a body Christ is a supernatural that was in that body and when Jesus said I and my father he was referring to the word that he was referring to Christ the way together now the word of God you cannot see it with your naked God is a spirit John 4234 Spirit those that worship Him shall worship Him in truth and in spirit now if the word of God you cannot see it with your negative then God when he descend when he processed himself he become the logos that Pillar of Fire that Moses saw in the burning bush that was nothing else but the angel of the Lord now where am I going to I'm trying to say to you that now when somebody depart it all depends on what was in him are we together because uh when you separate when these three things separate each and everyone takes his own Direction the spirit goes back to God the soul goes back to uh Under The Altar and the body goes to the ground amen now it all depends that's what the scripture says it all depend that now when you were here on Earth what was your relationship with God let's let's analyze it very softly the Bible says in the Book of Matthew 25 there were 10 virgins they were waiting for the coming of the groom are we together some had and some had no oil what does that oil T the Holy Ghost what is the Holy Ghost let me tell you what is the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost is not speaking in Tong the Holy Ghost is not singing in town let me tell you what the Bible says in the book of Ephesians chapter 1 verse 17 say the Lord will give you a spirit and that spirit will give you an knowledge and understanding of who he is can I repeat and in the Book of John 16 John verse 12 verse 12 it says now I will give you the comforter he will take from me to you and you will never understand this book when you read you read the words that are written here but you need a spirit that will come and interpret what you've been reading that's what we call the Holy Ghost apart from that then when you have that anointing it's just to to please yourself but the real Holy Ghost the one that needs to that you should interpret them now they five 5 10 waiting for coming some have oil some have known now out of this 10 who's going to a judgment because he says they were virgins all of them right you must know that in the judgment the Bible says the Lord will divide people like a a Shepherd separating sheep from goat now now my way of preaching I Don't Preach for somebody that is going to the Judgment right I'll tell you why let's read the Matthew 202 uh Matthew chapter 20: 20 then came to him the mother of zebedee's children with her sons worshiping him and Desiring a certain thing of him right this woman came to our Lord Jesus Christ the Bible says she desire a certain thing then and he said unto her what Willl thou she said unto him grant that this my two sons May sit the one on thy right hand and the other on the left in thy kingdom you see it's a good thing the mother brings his two sons say Lord this is my desire that these two sons of mine one should be on the right on your left in your kingdom which is good then let's jump and go to verse 22 22 but Jesus answered and said he know not what he ask are you able to drink of the cup that I shall drink of and to be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with they said unto him we are able and he said unto them he shall drink indeed of my cup and be baptized with the baptism that I am baptized with yes but to sit on my right hand and on my left is not mine to give but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared of my father says always will Jesus will talk about his father and then there was a time where he was asked and said no show us the father and then he said the father is in me now here when he says uh but to sit on my right hand and on my left is not mine to give but it shall be given to them for whom it is prepared of my father when he says for whom it is prepared of my father it simply means that now he is uh processed from the father yes now when is processed from the all those are processed it will the father that knows but now he says himself says the father is in me you remember John John 42 142 say at that day shall know that I am in the father you in me and I in you in other words he says depends on the predestination see how did God predestinate you now you cannot be predestinated and then go to the Judgment no you cannot go to the the Bible says the Saints will judge the nations are we are we together so that's why he says now you can drink you can be baptized in other words he say it started by saying uh would you be would you be would you be able to be baptized as I am they said yes okay find it now to choose a position it's a predestination it comes from the father now when somebody departs some people they depart and go to The Fifth Dimension Fifth Dimension is H they waiting for the judgment and when they wait for judgment then they are inment some when they die or they depart they go to another dimension which is the sixth Dimension where there is not de remember the Bible in the book of First Corinthians chapter 15 chapter 15 if you read from the the 35th verse it goes to a point where speaks about the different bodies it speaks about body Celestial body terral so now he says we are wearing this body this body is terrestrial but when we we we depart we wear another which is Celestial to weight with that body in the celestial body after the in heaven we'll be having a glorified are we together so this is a temporary Bo now each and every one of us will take a direction the most important part is that now when you take a direction you must take the right direction right now Luke Paul Paul was the messenger of the Church of Ephesians and Paul set up a foundation and said if there's anybody that comes and build another Foundation even if it can be an angel let him be Aur now because uh time is tight let me not read the bible let me speak because I'm conscious of time this is what happened then when Jesus Christ departed then uh the book of Peter chapter 3 and verse 18 and 19 3: 18 19 it says his soul went to those Souls that repented not he went to preach he went to H to preach and then after preaching then he went to Paradise right you know the story of divas and the rich man Lazaro I mean Lazaro and div sorry and then Lazaro was in the chest of Abraham enjoying himself Divas was in hell and then he wanted water to quench his tongue different that one was with Abraham remember that Abraham could not go to the sixth Dimension and even Isaac and even Joseph and all of themob because they were not cleansed by the blood of God of Jesus he had to die first so that their sins could be washed but they were covered by the blood of the animals then from Hell Revelation 1 verse 1 verse he says I am the one that was dead now I am alive exactly then I have the keys of death and hell are we together death and hell then with those keys then he went to paradise and released those that were in paradise and then when he released them then he took them you I think you have read also the book of Psalm psms I think is chapter 7 ver or chapter 24:7 can you read it for us my brother even if I said I don't want to read it and qu it but 24:7 Psalms 24:7 so I'll tell you why I'm reading this he took them out of paradise now it's very nice when you you you you you you when somebody has departed and people have got an understanding but it becomes a crucial matter when somebody departed and people don't understand she's going to represent us that is a pitiful moment are we together all right I'll explain that but he went to hell he took the keys from the Devil the devil was in charge of death and hell and even grave if you read the book book of Hebrews uh I think it's chapter two 2 verse 14 don't open it don't open it he says now there were people that were afraid of death so what did Jesus do he became a human being so that he should share his blood and relieve those people who had the fear of death who was the slave of death so now he went to hell took those the devil was the boss because he had the keys you remember when he was with Peter when he Peter and ask him who who do people say that I the son of man am then Peter said thou are the Christ the son of the Living God that was what we call a revelation that's what our Lord wanted he wanted to know whether people they understand is or it's just people that want breed see Miracles see him walking upon the sea they don't understand who he was so Peter said remember our Lord uh had some dispensation that's what kills people today Moses uh dispensation was to take the children of Israel of Egypt and then when he reached the SE the ministry changed and he went to the desert when he reached River Jordan his ministry was finished and Joshua took over with another Minister we are we together and let them cross over then after crossing over he gave them their inheritance amen are we together amen now we always become stagnant and stay one place our ministry is not changing with the dispensation is not changing with the relevant Ministry are we together now our Lord Jesus Christ after doing all the Miracles he said who do people say I the son of man am now that was the changing of the ministry immediately Peter said thou are the Christ the son of the Living God then he say that's it flesh and blood not revealed that means are we together then I can change my Ministry are we together then what did he do from that day on he said I will go to Jerusalem I'll be arrested and I will resurrect on the thir then Peter said Over My Dead Bo he said get deep behind me you Dev because you don't want the ministry to change are we together then the ministry changed that's what he was preaching then when he was about to be arrested he said this evening you people you you're going to be ashamed because I'm going to be arrested this this evening then Peter said never and then it's when he said to him before the coke could crow the crow could the can craw can craw yeah you know it he said you will deny me three times amen then Peter said never he even influenced all the disciples were against Jesus concerning that are we together now the ministry changes and when the ministry changes and people remain with the old Stant Ministry and then when they remain with that old Stant Ministry they they miss their inheritance because because josua show them their inheritance Reuben's your and with our ministry we are Gentiles we are not Jews we have our own Ministry which differs from the Jew our ministry started from Paul it went off started from Ephesians Church you read it in the Bible speak about Ephesus sadis Philadelphia those things and and that's the changing of the ministry now the relevant Ministry now on the Lan Ministry and then what does the Bible says about you another hard no you see and then they reject that they see now it's the ministry that is relevant to that the Bible says when the Devil comes in like a flag God raises now in closing Amen in closing what I wanted to say is that now uh a Believer does not die you just depart are we together amen now what makes him to depart made me to say it does not die because uh the Bible you read it in John it says you read verse 30 it says that's why he said I and my father are you see amen now when he says I and my father are it doesn't mean that this is my son I am the father then we become one I me I me we become two in that Cas but when he says I and my father he says I am God says if you don't believe that you'll die in your s together now a Believer when he depart he should be I and my father it should be God that is there it should be a minor God maybe let me read it and close it uh John chapter 10 and then I'm closing amen John chapter 10 minutes just read ver 30 verse 30 John chapter 10 I and my father are one that is Jesus by the way who is his father is it Joseph okay if it's God when Mary was expecting a child who slept with Mary how so now let me tell you it's Z it's the angel of the Lord that came to Mary and said You shall conceive and bear a son and Mary says how and then he said the Holy Ghost will will overshadow me how did they how did the Holy Ghost the word that Gabriel spoke uh they started arguing until Mary says Let It Be according and then he said okay let it be according to your we believe that and when he believe that word and that word changed in his womb blood are we together and the blood of Jesus the DNA Jesus was that of the word of God are we together when he died when they pierc him on the cross that blood you know that the blood has got life the life of the blood is what we have received together we have received the blood the life of the blood when killed Abel what did God say his blood his blood your brother's blood tells the story are we together so now that's how it is now finish up let me close so now the blood when he says I and my father one which means his blood and his father and his father's blood are one and then our blood is a natural blood from our parents but we receive the word of God when we receive the word and that word when it germinated us build that that another body which is Christ like it did with with Jesus it descended from heaven after after H uh baptism read it in Matthew 3 after descended in him started saying I and my father right finish it John 10:3 I and my father are one then the Jews took up stones again to Stone him Jesus answered them many good works have I showed you from my father for which of those those Works do you Stone me the Jews answered him saying for a good work we Stone thee not but for blasphemy and because th that thou being a man makest thyself God Jesus answered them yeah just listen there Jesus answered them those that knows when a woman is is expectant even even if she was so strict she becomes very soft she becomes very nice very humble and soft it is said it's because of the angel that is waiting for that baby so our sister is not in hell not on The Fifth Dimension is waiting the Bible says we who are alive shall not prevent them those that are see he has asleep and then he will she will resurrect then I mean the spirit will come and pick up the soul then pick up the body then we will see here and we will change and meet him are we together may the Lord bless [Applause] you amen amen uh we should have introduced you we should have we should have introduced you yeah but now you overtaken us Harvest why are you living amen amen amen this is Elders K amen amen we thank God for providing him I thought brother will come and introduce him amen amen now the Bible says the words are life amen amen and truth and it is only the word that can remove fear amen amen now when you have taken the words that he has been saying here you'll be happier because it Rel you because there is another that is coming for you and you shall not die amen amen so this is what he was saying that we are not ending here we are taking another dimension amen amen and then you cannot be in
