is in the bride he is and the mind of Christ to know what he once done with the word she does it in his name she has thus said the Lord Queen course then it is dramatized so that the Holy Spirit Waters it until it is grown and served its purpose our subject this morning is the secretary and we're going to look into this Secret Ary and the people that are in the constellations because this age we are beyond the seven churches that we have is of the Angels foreign amen is there the soul foreign now for I'm going to read foreign and I won't be long ER bow will just try to be accurate okay see before we reach there is another party in the book Christ is the mystery of God revealed the mystery of God revealed it his church is himself revealed the bride is himself when he is revealed that is the bride of Christ it's not the message that's what we are dealing with logo is now we're going to read from the scriptures and where are we gonna start simply let's read that scripture brother I'm going to oh you look alike where were we Luke 17. where is it gonna take us to see right that's the one yesterday's scripture we just want to put that one I'm sorry first John from verse 1 to 5. verse one two five and shall we Bawa hits Heavenly Father it's another wonderful day we came further from different walks of life from different places with one thing in our hearts let us go unto the house of the Lord like David of old yeah just to worship God because in the house of their lord there will be Joy singing healing salvation that is in the house of the Lord we are here a lot of God looking unto thee the author and the finisher of our faith bless our pastor Our Father who has called us to this great meeting and we know something again is going to happen to our hearts this is the regathering of the souls the people who are with you from before the foundation thank you Lord as we open the scriptures may you bless us bless our pastor bless the church as I pray in Jesus Christ name amen foreign Italian yes [Music] you may take your seats and that which was from the beginning in the beginning was the word which we have head okay amen it's not a reputation now I shall say near guti even today you will hear because you have heard you will see because you have sinned we are born thank you Brothers I understand the musicians will will be leading the band as we are we will be entering through the fairly Gates yes singing I mean I don't know how many believe it is going to be like that you believe that one day we will be rapture do you believe that okay now that which local which talking to their in some other attempts they say they all timers but we we are not the old timers from the mind of Christ is the secretary the word is in the brights okay now if the word is in the bride um me standing here to preach I'll be preaching you and you'll be me amen y'all your amen would mean yes it's me you know that in the bible let me rewind this the Bible says in the beginning was the word was with God was God then it says and there was a man sent from God I think we said yesterday not sent by God and this man sent by God from God meaning he is part of the word when he was asked to address himself he said yeah I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness [Music] because he knew himself to be that scripture believe that today me by the time we will believe in this place that we are a scripture we are the scriptures now the message the messenger was sent to preach foreign right no other form of life can believe the words now I I will read here uh this is this book here it says it speaks of the cycle of Eternity in English and this is the future home of the bride and the bridegroom in what in the future page 29 says you can't find no Corner eternity is like a ring you can't find nobody to listen you can't find no stopping place I will call him if you are a son or a daughter of God since he has called you you can't stop Maybe because you are in a cycle and you know in this cycle let me try it again and when Adam forfeited because God and men were one I can get it for you in the book Christ is the mystery of God revealed where it says revealed this is God's mystery God and men were one yeah if you were one with God you'll say Amen to that um it's a secret that's why it says the word is where in the bride now I can't go around trying to find a place for me to worship because the word is where and what's good is really give me amen amen we are not searching as if we are not looking for something as a phoning for because the secret here is now the word is God the word is in the bride he is you can find no corner to us perfect as perfect cycle taller even more place in a perfect cycle ending it is you go on and on I don't care how far you go to foreign where he started anything that started in eternity has no stopping place my brother I'm looking for that cycle and I think today I have occupied a greater place here again in the book it is in the same book because we have this book Perfection perfection in the book Perfection we realize that God there is a cycle here perfectionist the top part it says and the bottom part says men laying a pants all right earn s-i-m I didn't have time to sit with the brothers here is the beginning s e is at the ending and as he was at the beginning foreign God is endless like eternity unlike Satan Ina let me tell you about Satan Revelation 12 verse 12. 12 10 to 12. and I had a loud voice saying in heaven now this comes salvation and strength in the Kingdom of our God and the power of this Christ I think Israel is brother Branham telling you about that part therefore rejoice in heaven prophet and let that dwell in them he's talking about the raptured people at that time now rejoice foreign [Music] amen he knows that his time is cornered that's why he's so vicious now and now you can see because [Music] you see they are coming together yes yes if the sons of God come are coming together Satan of also they come name all right amen it is that time so Satan knows you don't need to remind him he knows that his time in shorts [Music] and I also know that the time of the Rapture is just here Satan also knows that he is short foreign [Music] what did it say about you those the Dwellers of the earth and the whoa eating Maya that is it is referring to the time of the tribulation which is three and a half years Satan foreign and even now put in a man who is they he is preparing he has lungs for that yeah we are watching we are seeing it preparing for that when the bride goes up why because nothing shall touch that bride amen and the bride believes that we are called when the men of sin shall come in he will never be successful while the bride of Christ is here Christ will take his bride first who Christ then hell is on Earth there is a system and the Dwellers of the sea on Earth they operate from the sea and all those things because in that new Heaven and Earth [Applause] that's why you see today go to Every Church you find water now that is amen because water is going to burn the fires of God to clean the Earth now we are here let me look at it uh no I I could yeah you can find no eternity if I know never find the corner of a perfect cycle infection you could run and run through ages that's never I could never say there will never never be an end to it and that's the way God is and when and God which always was yeah perfect okay to begin with we will always be the same he never can change now this great chain of perfection are called The Chain was broken by time space because but it says there came the space of time this strange great chain s and there was broken by this time space that's why now if you can look at it now has gone beyond time no more ages to the bride is [Music] still funny that is now in the rooms the Angels that's why the constellation is none of the Angels now let me read you something here about this uh what happened with this constellation um I hope it doesn't happen again let me look at this uh brother I'm looking for this book here will help me to find it loud standing in the Gap standing in the game yes I had it here with me Perhaps it is this one yes yes thank you brother okay let me check something here standing in the cabin is that page 20. I saw seven angels in a form of a pyramid many places about the Pyramid of angels and you see even the pyramid the prophet said to the people in that great vision Prophet is but as the time goes on what is the people left one by one because there was no response to some other people but to the other people still looking inside because that was beyond time is because there was something they could see those who remain with Christ they said where shall we go eternal life there's something that they saw that kept them rallied around him because of the words of eternal life something keeping us because we have seen the words of eternal life was even crucified [Music] the predestinated himself okay I wanted to be sorry to put it that way but no no I'm not sorry God's word when he is so the words of eternal life where in Jesus Peter saw that and he even today he is with Jesus foreign I saw seven angels that descending in the Gap I don't know if we can reach that place amen amen I've asked many a time which game the sun forfeited the book yeah foreign no all these ages the battle is just for one thing since God cannot be defeated now where is something whether it will receive amen or not but here is something here um and in this book Perfection Perfection the prophet says the Lord Jesus which is came and sprinkled blood where's luck from this side of the Gap [Applause] because for the Redemption of Adam that place did not belong to the cherubim it belonged to men he was there at the gate but when he fulfated the book God to tell me God drove them out of the garden and so he put some cherubim but cherubim stood therefore in case in in state of Adam that's the place of men says so the game no this one it will take a real real amen from a theophany firstly listen I saw seven angels in a form of a pyramid is [Music] step down and pick me up this is the second commission best commission preach the weight is was the angels from eternity amen amen so it was a pyramid foreign I saw seven angels in the form of a pyramid yeah the pyramid seven steps to God all right amen then as we come to the seventh step she says you can enter the New Jerusalem without meeting the king first our words maker and Builder is God Abraham knew that there is God and the Bible and the literal place where the city will come that's where he met the king machine that King is still the same one when he fought he was called Michael he comes and he put himself in the body of a man for us because when he was born it was the word Mary [Music] foreign whom God has called they they are the blood of God which if you receive the word of God is [Applause] all right amen and it says he tell you you shall never see death of let alone die but you shall never see the Bible says so in fact is the insurance it says you shall never see all right amen I think we have crossed Jordan that was Elijah foreign if you could order you if you can see me at um you know you must be vigilant you've got to follow me until you see me going along it shall happen to you Elijah had a mental amen amen saw Elijah Elijah a leash after that mental he knew that because if God is gonna take his man and I remain meaning I will remain with a history like the people they are not looking for they are not expecting us to tell them about how the prophet went hunting and his gun was this this and so forth yeah that's why he never said the gun is in the bride he says oh man my man my man that's right because the people they don't Bound for the history of the prophets [Applause] they were sent Amen to bring their way to the bride is Isaac until Rebecca could see Isaac Isaac you know we can't go back because we have seen him already amen amen amen and when Isaac when Rebecca Isaac and he said who is that and your Prophet said Prophet is the son of my master what a lawyer in daughter now yeah the camera meaning I have arrived amen that's why the bride of Christ has got off the camera some people are still remaining on the back of cameras [Music] they don't arrive because those who have arrived have this eventually God bless you all right amen [Applause] getting off the camera without walking towards him mind your soul Amber amen pride of Christ now um [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] there was a chariot waiting there amen [Applause] The Chariot of Israel calling upon the prophets this is what he was looking for all this time [Music] not a membership I remember [Music] knowing Dutch with the mentor as rooting who is going to do what Elijah has done I mean what you need is the mentor is we yeah the way it becomes your Mentor is really painful that was preached by the seventh angel Messengers [Applause] amen that's it and the mentor came down in Google yeah remember when Elijah asked him that Elijah what will you want me to do for you what did you want me to do for you shall I repeat it leisure foreign [Music] foot and the Lord that's how he addressed Elijah when Elijah said shall you remain here he said no I'm not looking for a fellowship the double potion [Applause] um I want the spirit that is in you know that I can be able to continue music if I can have that same spirit all right yes Lord and Allah that's why we followed the prophet of God [Applause] from the pyramid [Music] of angels then he said remain here what is going beyond the curtain of time [Music] Amen to the curtain of time foreign foreign the children of God have been residing in the church ages all right amen and the prophet says non-profit that's what God did it they cross over Elijah crossed over Elijah must cross by those that are in the constellation yeah is that right people can say what they say and do what they do and whatever they hear the sound this is the age of iskati of the astronauts summer astronauts even a song my foot only that I wonder if one at the end of the service yeah who can sing me that astronaut is say it is I thought you are listening to these

he smoked the water wash I am man see so they cross over there [Music] the fullness is on the other side not in the Church of Jesus [Music] okay amen maybe you are struggling to find it what it says I say Elisha was supposed to cross over there right amen go back a bit what it says [Music] it's a fellowship also here it's a church meaning as the Lord is on his seat the soul of Elijah um amen so that's why he just followed yes some brothers the Lord has sent to me copila the Lord leaves and your Soul as long as the Lord is on his face okay amen did we understand that Elijah means that Elisha I can't remain here and worship here is ah awful Amanda I want to worship where I can rally around the Throne of God is [Applause] that's why he followed and then is foreign what is happening today
