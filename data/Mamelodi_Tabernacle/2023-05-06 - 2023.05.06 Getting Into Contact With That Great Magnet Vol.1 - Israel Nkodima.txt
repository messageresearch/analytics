Description:
Title: Getting into contact with that great magnet. Vol 1
Preached by Pastor Israel Nkodima on 06 May 2023 at Khayelitsha in Cape Town. 

The purpose of this sermon was to show the audience about Getting into contact with that great magnet. The Pastor read the following scripture: Gen 14:18-20 “And Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth bread and wine: and he was the priest of the most high God. And he blessed him, and said, Blessed be Abram of the most high God, possessor of heaven and earth: And blessed be the most high God, which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand. And he gave him tithes of all.

Christ has no beginning, then it means the seed also has no begging. 
The Theophany in us has no mother and father, that is the men who can meet Melchisedec, not our earthly men. 

The Pastor also read from the spoken word: An Exposition Of The Seven Church Ages (4 - The Smyrnaean Church Age)
It’s the blood test that shows whether you belong to God or not.

The Pastor read the following quotes from the spoke of 65-0221E - "Who Is This Melchisedec

Second, He begin to form Himself towards flesh, in a theophany it’s called, “the Word, a body.” This then is the state He was in when He met Abraham, was called Melchisedec. He was in the form of theophany. Now, we’ll get to that and prove it in a few minutes, the Lord willing. He was the Word.
65-1204 - The Rapture
105 Now we find here that Enoch was the seventh from Noah, which was a type of the church ages. Now, all of the rest of the six men, before him, died, but Enoch was translated. Enoch was raptured, the seventh, showing that it’s the seventh church age that takes the Rapture. Now, there’s no doubt, we’re in the seventh church age. We all know it.

106 Now, it’s the seventh church age that takes the Rapture. All of the other six died. But Enoch was translated, because, “He was not found. God took him.” But Enoch, raptured, was a...

Genesis chapter 14. from Verse 18 to 20. yes sir fourteen and Melchizedek king of Salem brought forth Bread and Wine and he was the priest of the most high God and he blessed him and said Blessed Be Abram of the most high god possessor of Heaven and Earth and blessed be the most high God which hath delivered thine enemies in into thine hand and he gave him tithes of all verse 8. and this is Chapter 14 verse 18. um [Music] [Music] God bless you may be seated all right okay here we we are for some few but the spiritual meaning we've been going through this book about the Melchizedek yes attack under I think you are acquainted with it here amen amen and that king of Salem so we're going to read some show because we've been going through this Melchizedek because um he has no beginning and The New Ending is but you know last time we read where it says when she met Abraham he was Melchizedek yesterday I think I'm I'll be preaching to the seed of Abraham and the Seed of Abraham is Christ now Christ has got no beginning Christiano amen amen and then he has no beginning and it's a blessing to preach to the people who have no beginning and then because the people with a beginning they come and end up somewhere brother there's a book I think is smiling if it is okay now but I want to take this part okay uh Brenda Brendan asked a question then he said where is the sign of the real Seed of Abraham um [Music] yeah since this is the end time they've been preaching about it talking about it but now this is the end time really the signs are there because Christ who had three and a half years of his prophecy I mean and he said now the last three and a half uh yes is now of Lucifer now uh the world the Earth the world is about to start the three and a half years which is the Tribulation period foreign you know I can start at the message church and you stand the message church and you start the Mission Church sometime you find that I've got a certain Doctrine going that way of them what they say Church also going the other way now let's remain as the bride um because the bride is not in pieces the bride has only one God one Faith one baptism everything is one um and the bright is the word of God is again the word is the bride of Christ now this part that I'm looking at here it says it page [Music] one one paragraph 130 paragraph 130. so we're still going to talk about it but I just quote Yeah I want you to know to whom I'll be talking to no yes and the blood test shows whether you are gods or not um we are God's children and you have eternal life but the soldiers you perform that Soul shall be separated okay now here's the thing here now you know the Bible says in the beginning God created now it says anything that had a beginning has an end and because anything that had a beginning is a creation right that's why once you talk about it he has no beginning of God God was not created he was always [Music] I'm looking at this the prophet asked a question here um that is who is this and that is page 29 paper 29 paragraph 1 60. here paragraph 160. but but then where is that Royal Seed of Abraham I thought you'd say yeah yeah it is because it's a question where is where Daniel where is that Royal Seed of Abraham [Music] amen God bless you sir where is the assignment because they have a sign you know we look for or science of things science of the time and Sciences everything comes with a sign it is if something comes we will always look for a size yeah what if you ask for a question and today with the Seed of Abraham no need to ask who are these people you must look for a sign [Music] God came down and was manifested in human flesh that's a great sign and told what Sarah was thinking on in the back now the last sign before the gentle world was destroyed by fire um the world will be destroyed it's not one thing I don't really we have the God created God the Bible says God formed the earth and the world the Earth is the missile I'm standing on here but the world is the system that's why it says he came to the world to the system and the system uh would not believe him rejected him yamana now you see even the system today everywhere Christians are are being chased around now we've been watching that it's towards this is the closing the end of the history of this world now this is the closing the Royal Seed of Abraham is just waiting for that moment uh we have I have something here this book the rapture is there if if not no problem now we read it's a question the prophet asked on okay I will read this part here I'm there because we are not preaching to the world listen now we find that Enoch was the seventh from no one yeah which was a type of the church ages all the rest of the six men before him died did you hear that you because the others you know we're talking about the seven changes but the Brethren from the other ages they are in the sixth Dimension by which I mentioned yesterday we don't have with us here what is remaining here is their seventh yes foreign [Music] have looked at that in the Bible I believe and how even take for this is a Elijah and then he knew he had a revelation that a chariot was coming [Music] not wonderful if you have a a revelation judge the Rapture is about to take place [Applause] when he started he was getting into it he was getting into the Rapture he was getting into the Chariots but he started with rapturing strength [Applause] I mean uh it will happen with you these days you won't be found but Enoch was translated he was not founded and it says but Enoch rap church it was a type of oil the rest of them and but the end time will be great will be called and yeah foreign [Music] [Music] to you know when they're playing before it takes off to stand up start on the runway are you constipated at that time it is not like a taxi yes you can still stop and say hey stop that Texas when the plane has started you can never stop it that's why you can't stop the bread of Christ [Applause] it's already on the runway [Music] no God bless you brethren now go I'm still here was translated he was not found okay now the end time bride um not deficient Church age will be called out foreign [Music] now I'm preaching to the last foreign foreign [Applause] last time we were looking but you know brother Brandon says in this who is this the question is who is this Lona not that I lower [Applause] yeah this one yes foreign because I'm looking at this when [Music] when he appeared let me just try to find my picture when he met Abraham he was Melchizedek I want to repeat something a bit you know last time I think you were watching we're talking about what was the title the migration of the citizens of [Music] yeah and but he says when Abraham met him he was so I don't know and the other thing is people understood what the prophet is saying and doesn't matter when Abraham met him he was melchized it was it was God but when Abraham the difference is because Abraham is a citizen me now when he meets Abraham meets him as melchized he said that is a citizen you know you have now the king of Salem amen amen [Music] he said something he is now now we look at it you know how we we looked at it last time I think you've seen it is speaks about this to the first hem um you know he Fester appeared meant this festival and we see again how he met the second Hammer symbolism but he says when Abraham met him all this time is God God but when Abraham met him [Applause] now because Abraham is a citizen um when he met him the first time which is Genesis Chapter 14 verse 18 Genesis Chapter 14 verse 18. he was from heaven from Heaven is really increased off there a priest from heaven I can it is somewhere in the book of Hebrews yeah um I've got an old old book here right login the the I'm trying I'm going to reach this old book of mine you know the first time I met brother and he gave me this book and others as well I didn't know I thought we were we would go together but he decided to go before me but yet all right here where we are now go slap again a king in this book now the the the quotation here is different from the one in your book I mean there what is difference about that what's the difference is the difference this one is the the older as I was told that is amen okay a king comes down from salaam and met Abraham coming from the slaughter of the Kings and this King didn't have no father no mother [Music] had no beginning of days and then now who did Abraham meet now think he he didn't have no father he didn't have no mother he never had the time again amen amen and so that same king of Salam Allah has to be living today amen [Applause] [Music] come in that's why you know he says where is the sign of the royal Seed of Abraham now he says do you see it was ethiopianism that was the son of God hey you know there's things in the Bible here yes you know we have some symbolism which was the logos out of out of God came forth the logos now the Sun that was with the father was the logos [Music] I think page 15. it says it says gave Beth wazala to now this one says he gave birth was Allah to to his do you have that boo brother let me put it right he gave himself death to a son [Applause] yes yeah yeah he says he he gave himself to a son [Applause] you know when he met how he met Abraham foreign uh females Frozen because when Jesus was born Joseph didn't need a female Joseph was put aside and the prophet of God says Gabriel Gabriel came to Mary was a Maria with the seed amen amen then he spoke to Mary Maria he says watching when he spoke to Mary what happened once again only did you know yes the word that he spoke to Mary Elizabeth instead of Joseph came the word and they wait in Merry materialized when it materialized then a son was born [Applause] I'm telling you the true citizen the Cod it is you'll see at the end of when brother bring in the message no at the end of it did you hear him talking about the angel the Angels that's what the people don't know about it because he said he sent the angel with the servants here he says that angel came to himself came to him he says he flew to me then he said of that engine that is the seventh seed all right we are seeing things here amen now let us this melchizedeka and because we want to look into this how Abraham met him we will know how to meet him because he says yeah all right I'm did you read that part but why food I don't know [Music] hey [Music] this is the book here let me try it here I don't know if somebody oh right this Hebrews can I reach all right I will read this party yeah um firstly page 309 says I am so glad who's that um I am so delighted I met you this is then page three or eight paper three or eight years are you ready to meet him [Applause] God bless yourself [Music] have you come away he said that is page 308 are you ready to meet him or all the citizens should meet their keys [Applause] were opened and he said he is a king okay I now let's read it let's look at this he says you'll tell me if you believe it and then he says blessed be the name of the Lord something on the inside of me I don't know how long I'm going to repeat this I've been repeating it something into on the inside of me that's brother Branham speaking one day can you mean and he spoke peace to me and he gave me eternal life okay then last we were looking you've seen it now how he met how is met him it said something here let me try it at three 70 here we have read it I I think last week evening okay before we finish Melchizedek was the king of Salem um the first time he saw him coming from heaven that was a second that was another time saw him coming with two men um um you know yeah you see it is very difficult day yeah I mean all right we know that Jesus yes was not the child of Mary of Joseph but if he is talking to the people now he says you know Jesus that's when he's talking to the people yummy Joseph was not his father yet he was called to his father okay even Mary was not a her man his mother um but yet he was called his mom okay all right you know he says but he was made after the order of Melchizedek he had no beginning so he was the one that stood today the thing is if you will remember how Abraham recognized him he says this is how he recognized it is not because he had a sensation God made him a promise gave him a promise and when he come into contact you know if God has promised you something there's a time when you come into contact with what God has promised you now you know when she came into contact she said I perceived you are a prophet um this woman when she met Jesus that's when the two texts she was waiting for that for that word elderly because she kept on saying I know the Messiah he will tell us all things but yet he was a prostitute with a promise yeah was not yet made um [Applause] every moment in a closer he would find some a moment to say something yes next time you see him there [Music] and then next time he meets you he says [Music] um because inside of his way of Abram was an anchor holding that promise tell me when he he come into contact [Applause] with that great magnet he knew that we are asking that promise was in flesh he knew that he he's a man now he made a promise and when the promise took flesh was recognized by Abraham he says what that's when okay instead of you okay you know he's talking about this magnet you know I'm making it they must must put it if it makes a contact with a metal um there's a force but that force is invisible it can pull a matter with that invisible force and that one when he met up [Music] could pull that promise God has put that magnet in you when he comes you should recognize [Music] Sunday [Applause] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] when she caught up with the magnet what are you saying today [Applause] now you have a magnetism there is no one is going to say see God as the Bible says to come through a covenant very wonderful look at Moses come into the sea yes and there was something in him is there a man who can risk and try to cross the city no it was that magnet in Moses Moses knew something that um he was not Taking Chances [Music] because he was under a cabinet because that man had a magnet in him yeah the people with a magnet here they know where they are they don't want to believe and what not to believe although people are going to and forth they can never be deceived foreign [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] and that magnet will just pick you up numbers when the magnet in you you know that's why Enoch already he was magnetized when he was magnetized he started to walk and the Bible says the Bible can walk with God so the bride of Christ will walk with God they will be gone she will be gone um amen how did he meet Brothers Johnny if I'm asking this question I that's why I first answered he first answered yeah how Abraham met him being magnetized and say what this is him foreign now he tend to utility foreign foreign because Christ is the anointing who created it's not that I mean a human name that's why brother Brennan says that is the family name amen amen as well as the anointing [Music] if something which is revealed some say it is not revealed some say this something who do you say that I am all right there was a pause a pose so they stopped Bama and Peter said Thou Art the Christ son of the Living God amen amen Thou Art where now please do he didn't say Jesus Christ now the Lord said go City Peter Petrus flesh and blood has not revealed this to you it is my Father in heaven did you know that scripture and God said to Moses Moses tell the children of Israel I spoke with you from heaven you remember the scripture you remember the scriptures no well you you remember the scripture all right he said what is tell the children of Israel I spoke to you [Music] sorry you know reading food can be dangerous without a magnet reading without revelation you will interpret it without title inside the way it suits your mind learn their lives away that is when you are ready without food when we read you know like like last night I was reading that the food these things I understand tomorrow we have another service you'll watch these things and reading Funda now while reading Funda I I I can't say amen and what's good amen to a thing I'm reading I'm looking at with amen comes well you are magnetized every then people read the spoken word abandoned food is let me foreign [Music] [Music] because all of us would be magnetized now that's why the answer of Peter there and apostle hello who do men say they say something should we have such a thing in this message you are quiet should some say in the message some say and some saying [Applause] we only have he said brother Brennan says [Applause] [Music] They Don't Preach he preaches through them [Applause] what they believe now what's this in closing here what the bright believes is what he himself he believes in you [Music] is that right now okay that's why it says you know the city that high priest became us wait until we touch that I I won't open it now but that great priest that is the Bible the Bible says [Applause] of the uh priesthood will look at it okay and that's why now you know don't go maybe lastly here
