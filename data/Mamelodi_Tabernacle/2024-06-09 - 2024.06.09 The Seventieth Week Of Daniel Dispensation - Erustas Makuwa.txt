Description:
Title: The Seventieth Week of Daniel Despensation
Preached By Pastor Erustas Makuwa  at Mamelodi Tabernacle on Sunday 09 June 2024.

The Pastor read the following scriptures:

Daniel 9: 24-27 Revelation 11: 1-3 Acts: 15:14 Romans 11: 24-26 Revelation 11: 7-8 Revelation 13: 15-17 Revelation 7: 9-10

The purpose of the sermon was to present a spiritual and scriptural talk to the audience about the seventieth week of Daniel Desperation.

This spiritual talk is presented only to a prophetic class. Because scriptures are for that group and not for everybody. When Daniel went into captivity, he took with him the scrolls of Jeremiah.

Daniel found the prophecy of Jeremiah that they will be taken to captivity for seventy weeks.

All scriptural people, when they go somewhere they take their scriptures.

The scriptural people they want to see the scriptures living in a man. They want to see the scriptures being manifested. They asked Joshua that let God be with you according as he was with Moses.

In our time God brought back the channel and is only for people to come back in the channel. The prophet said to the three who went out, go back in the channel.

The seventy weeks were devided into seven weeks period, an sixty two weeks period and one week period. One week period was dedicated to the ministry of the messiah. One week is equal to seven years, and the week was devided into two.

The messiah will be given one week but he will be cut off during the week. He was cut off in order for the gentiles to come in.

The messiah came and prophesy about his cut off. He prophesy about the demolishing of the city and the demolishing of the  temple, about the scattering of the Isralites and about their restoration.
 
God likens Israel with the Fig tree, Vine tree, the Olive tree. We came in the gap when the messiah was cut off.

The Son of man is revealed to join the church to the headstone. 

When we talk about the mystery of God that is Christ. When the bride is taken in the raptur...

they want to take their children to that man and they believe if that man can touch their children their children will be blessed I believe it is from This Woman's Heart that if we can touch her child he will be or she will be blessed read the scripture Mark 10: 13-6 and they brought young children to him that he should touch them and his disciples rebuked those that brought them but when Jesus saw it he was much displeased and said unto them suffer the little children to come unto me and forbid them not for of such is the kingdom of God verily I say unto you whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child he shall not enter therein and he took them up in his arms put his hands upon them and bless them he took them into his arms and put his hand upon them and blessed them this is's hands but I believe the one who is inside he using to touch this child let's lose our eyes my dear heavenly father amen as you have done in those days this is the same incident which is

bring in Everlasting righteousness and to seal up the vision and prophecy and to anoint the most holy know therefore and understand that from the going forth of the Commandment to restore and to build Jerusalem unto the Messiah the prince shall be 7 weeks and three score and two weeks the street shall be built again and the wall even in TR troubles time and after three score and two weeks shall Messiah be cut off but not for himself and the people of the prince that shall come shall destroy the city and the sanctuary and the end thereof shall be with a flood and unto the end the war desolation and deter determined and he shall confirm the Covenant with many for one week and in the midst of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and oblu to cease for the overspreading of Abominations he shall make it desolate even until the consummation and that determin shall be poured upon the desolate this is also Revelation 11 11 we read verse 1 to 3 1 Revelation 111:3 and there was given me a re like unto a rot and the angel stood saying rise and measure the temple of God and the Altar and them that worship therein but the court which is without the temple live out and measure it not for it is given unto the Gentiles and the holy city shall they treat under foood 40 and2 months and I will give power unto the two witnesses and they shall prophesy a,2 and3 score days clothe in sa cloth okay let's lose our eyes as we pray father this is the privilege I am privileged to stand in front of your children and stand to stand in this place which is your place be with me be with my brother use my voice and my brother's voice to deliver your message to your children amen I pray in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen amen we may take our [Music] seat I was not aware that this this is a month end today but uh is all right today I've got what do we call call a spiritual talk a spiritual talk it is presented to the spiritual scriptural people it's a scriptural talk and it is it must be presented to the SC scriptural people but um the topic of this scriptural [Music] talk is the 17th week of Daniel dispensation [Music] sorry can the 17th week of Daniel dispensation in other words it's the dispensation of this 70th week my spiritual talk will be about that and when you come to the spiritual talk uh some will have to um take notes those who don't those who can't take notes they'll have just to listen because the Bible says they are also blessed those who read and those who here because this spiritual talk is presented to the prophetic class because um scriptures uh for that group these scriptures are not for everybody they are for a particular class of before I can talk about thisth week [Music] I must start from where it come from Daniel he was a scriptural man when he went to when he was taken to captivity he took some Scrolls SC he took some spoken words spoken he took the spoken word of Jeremiah I was told when my pastor was in the hospital when he went there to the hospital he also took his spoken way I was told when he was in the hospital he would have a chance to open his spoken way is what Daniel did in other way all scriptural people when they are going somewhere they took their their scriptures when they have got a little chance they open their to look what is inside amen when Daniel was there he opened the spoken word of jerem in captivity there then he found the prophecy of Jeremiah Jeremiah prophesied that they will be taken to captivity for 70 years but he didn't say what would happen after he said because of your unbelief you provoke God then you will be taken to captivity Daniel when he was looking in this this spoken way because we also we must know where we are and we will know where we are if we check this booken if we check the scripture the scripture will tell us where we are because we cannot worship properly if we don't know where we are and we must also know the place because if we don't know the place we'll never worship him because he is not just worshiped everywhere he has got a place where he want people to come to so that they can worship people that's why the people asked Joshua they they said to they they asked Joshua they said to josua Joshua jhua we are ready to listen to what you are saying but only thing we want you to see is the god who was in Moses to be in you the scriptural people they want to see scriptures living in a man and if they don't see the scriptures living in him they start to wonder about the place they are in because the place where they want to be is the place where the scriptures are manifested that's why Daniel to know his time he check spoken weight check they spoken he found that they have they have left with only two years they have already spent 68 and they have left only with two to move to move back something must happen because God said we must be here for 70 years after years will happen then he had to do something what what did he do he prayed he wanted to reconcile himself and his people to God because what brought them here is because they they fall out of the way of God even in our time has the channel then we must he want people to come back in the channel the channel is already there is for people to come into that channel that's why when the prophet saw the marching of the Bride he saw the two and the three at the back there getting out of the CH he didn't say repent he said go back the because the channel is already there even now the channel is there that is why I believe I am here because he in the [Applause] channel then he wanted to bring his people himself back to the channel he wanted to be sure that he is in the CH and he wanted to bring his people he went to God he want to talk to God that he must know he must know what will happen to his people are his people ready are they ready to go back have they make things correct with God and when he was praying then God [Applause] came he said Daniel Daniel 70 weeks 70 weeks are given to your people and your city then he he he expounded what will happen during those he divided that 70 week into three he said it will be seven week period I want them to reflect I just want to pass here it is the first period is it was divided into three periods it is a 7 week period and it is the 62 week [Music] period and one week period when you add them together they make 70 weeks are you together with us it's a spiritual talk then he said during the first period it will be the building of the Temple seven weeks then he said after you have built the temple then from the completion after you have competed then from that time until the Messiah 62 weeks from when the temple is completed until the Messiah came into Jerusalem on an the donkey it is on ad3 [Music] when he arrived there it will be 62 weeks are you together from when the temple is when the temple is completed from there until the Messiah enter Jerusalem it will be 622 he was stilling Daniel then he said then there will be one week and that week will be dedicated to the ministry of the Messiah that is scripture [Music] talk have you received it have you received right then if then I can go on then I said I'm going to go to one week and one week is dedicated the ministry the ministry of Messiah then this one week is divided in to two I would like them to fles is the ministry of Messiah the Bible says we have read he said he will be cut off he said vers 26 is after three score and two weeks Messiah should be cut off in other words when 62 weeks have passed when we are in another week will be cut in other words in the in that week Messiah won't complete the week he won't complete his ministry he will be cut off let me see where do I cut all right thank you very much a it doesn't it doesn't work oh here oh here yeah all right all right all right just be I don't know this thing all right yeah yeah yeah yeah ah this one and this one because one week is equal to seven [Music] years are you together with me then if you s years into two it will be 3 and half years and and then he was cut after 3 and half years why was he cut it was because of us God has to take his people from the Gentile for his name are you together with me Daniel you you had given seven [Music] tws and Messiah will be given one week from those and he will preach there to your people because Daniel's people are the Jews it's not you it's not you are the Jews then his city is Jerusalem he said these 7 tws are given to your people and your city and Messiah will be preached to you to you ju for one week then but he will be cut but when he's cut off there will be a gap there the gap between the two weeks is when we come in do you see there and when we get in here we get through seven Church in the Gap when before he was cut the Messiah prophesied he preached for three and a half years are you together with me when he was preaching he he preached about his cut [Music] off he prophesied about it that he will be cut off and he prophesied about during the first three and years when he's preaching there he prophesied about his he prophesied about the demolishing of the city and he prophesied about the demolishing of the temple he prophesied during the first he prophesied about the scattering of the people of Israel and he proph about restoration when he was proping about the restoration he he said he talk about the vi tree when he put forth his but and he said other trees and when you see them Reviving putting out their parts it will be it is the the Reviving of that what he has prophesied about the cutting the cutting off of himself it has already been done the scattering of the Jews it has already been done amen the the restoration the destruction of the temple it has been done it it was destroyed by Titans we know about that we're talking about things which has been done when he prophesied he said who unto those who will be giving sack and who unto those will be pregnant when the city will be destroyed those things have passed they were scattered to Every Nation this is the spiritual talk [Applause] talking to the scriptural
