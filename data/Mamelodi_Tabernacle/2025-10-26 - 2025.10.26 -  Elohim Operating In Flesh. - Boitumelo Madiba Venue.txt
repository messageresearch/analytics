We like to thank you gracious heavenly father that the man which is the logos, the word of God came and dwell amongst us. Just want to thank you gracious heavenly father that Lord you have chosen yourself a house &gt;&gt; and the house which is the heart of a man. Just want to thank you gracious Lord that your dead throne it is in the man. We are living in the time whereby father things are happening but lord we don't look at the things that are happening but father we hear what he says in our hearts &gt;&gt; because father the one who is on our hearts he's the logos &gt;&gt; he's Christ he's the word &gt;&gt; he has given us the word of this power &gt;&gt; so that in times like this we must in panic &gt;&gt; but we must trust him as the word &gt;&gt; because the word came and dwell amongst us. We just want to thank you gracious Lord that we are the bride of the most high God and there's nothing that will ever happen to your bride. Whoever touches your bride, he touches father the eye of the Lord. Because gracious heavenly father, greater is he that is within the bride than the one who is in this world. This morning, Father, we just want to say search our hearts &gt;&gt; and see whether, father, our hearts are ready for your coming. The devil has placed so many things in the heart and he is trying to take the word out of the heart. &gt;&gt; But gracious Lord, we just want to thank you &gt;&gt; that those who believe in the message of the seven seal, &gt;&gt; they are the one gracious heavenly father that will see the Lord soon and very soon. We stand against any principality of darkness. &gt;&gt; We stand against Satan himself. We stand against gracious heavenly father. All the witches and wizards they hear me in the name of Jesus &gt;&gt; that whatever that you are trying to do it will never succeed [Applause] because this is the house of the Lord. You can mix things to other people, but you'll never mix to the bride of the Lord because she knows that thus says the Lord. She's got a word and she knows who is the pastor and the pastor gracious heavenly father, he's the one who will take us through. Gracious Lord, when we cross over, gracious heavenly father, he will show us through because Lord, he is our shepherd. &gt;&gt; We pray for our shepherd this morning. &gt;&gt; Our pastor is God. &gt;&gt; We came from different places. Lord, &gt;&gt; we were lost, but he prayed for us. &gt;&gt; And today we are gathered here. Gracious Lord because father he did his work. Thank you Lord. Thank you father. We are running short of words this morning we pray. Search our hearts. Whatever which is not of God let it go away. Whatever is not planted by God let it go away. Whatever has been planted by the devil we uproot it now in the name of Jesus. and let it go away. Thank you, heavenly father. We pray for the word of God this morning.

Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So as we stand up on our feet singing our special song, we will allow our pastor &gt;&gt; to take the pullpit. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. And they shall when he shall be to son [Music] of God as he as [Music] He said, "Behold, I will set you and I shall prophet before [Music] and [Music] he shall the heart of their fathers to their children and the heart of their children to their fathers. Bless my God. Bless my God. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] I holy ghost. &gt;&gt; Holy Ghost wee. [Music] [Music] Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Holy Ghost. [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I greet all of you in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. How many are happy to be back in church this morning? I'm happy to be here. I say I'm happy to be here. Amen. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So for everything there is a time and a season. &gt;&gt; And the pastor when he gave me a call that I must come and minister here I realized that, okay, it's time. And last night, he called again to confirm that I'm coming. And I said, there's no way that you can disappoint an elder. Amen. Amen. I'm not a visitor here made home. Amen. I &gt;&gt; I can welcome visitors. [Music] [Applause] Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, we appreciate our pastor. Maybe you just take your seats for a few minutes. We special greetings to the elders and special greetings to the pastor back at home. I'll be seeing him after church. I said, "I must tell you that next week or the week after either of the two, &gt;&gt; he will be here physically in church." [Applause] How many love the pastor? Amen. Amen. We certainly appreciate him. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; I just want be to make a few remarks before I preach. &gt;&gt; In the book of Proverbs 22 is the chapter 22 &gt;&gt; verse 28. &gt;&gt; Verse 28. &gt;&gt; If the brothers bring it up, I want all of us to see it. Okay. It says, "Remove not the ancient landmark which thy fathers have said." And maybe if I say to this church, remove not the landmark which you which your pastor has said. Amen. How many believe the pastors left landmarks? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Remove not those landmarks. Let's go to Jeremiah 6. Jeremiah 6 verse 16. &gt;&gt; Verse 16. &gt;&gt; It says, "Thus says the Lord, Stand ye in the ways and see and ask for the old paths, &gt;&gt; not new path. Ask for the old path, timeested paths. Where is the good way? [Music] and walk therein and he shall find rest for your soul. How many believe we must find to the old ways ancient landmarks? Now I'm a I'm a student of this ministry. Now I'm a graduate of it. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; There are few things that we have learned from our elder. One point that we have learned is selflessness. He existed his entire life and he gave it all his to you as a church. Even now, he's still carrying you on his burdens. He's carrying your burdens on his shoulders. He has done so much for this ministry and all we have seen is nothing but selflessness. I I'm thinking of orphans that were taken to schools by this church. I'm thinking of houses that were built for the widows in this church. One thing that I've known over the years, no poor person ever misses the conference because they don't have money in this church. It reflects the selflessness of his character. Another thing that I learned from him, battles are not fought for money. The battles are fought for principles. He trained us to be in the ministry, not for money. But our focus is the souls. How many believe that this is a good principle? He pointed to the landmarks that have been left by our prophet. [Music] The seven seal is a landmark. Third pool is a landmark. The revelation of the son of man is a landmark. All those subjects those are the landmarks. So I stand behind this pullpit with respect and reverence to him as an elder. And I think we can appreciate him and his wife and the family. [Applause] He has never shamed us. &gt;&gt; This has been a scandal scandalless free ministry. Amen. Amen. Over 50 years. Amen. You know some ministries within 3 years. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Some ministries within 3 years. But 50 years later said to pastor, "We respect you. We appreciate his sacrifice. We appreciate his dedication to the body of Christ. All the journeys that he has taken. We are the beneficiaries of these labors of love. &gt;&gt; I think we can give him a round of applause. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So we'll move to the dedication dedications. &gt;&gt; Uh the newcomers if somebody if you ask and say who's that man who say that is a son at home. [Music] Amen. Amen. I'm home. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, I'll ask the Matipa family just to come as we say uh sing that song for little babies. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah, that's fine. [Music] &gt;&gt; Who sees? &gt;&gt; Who sees? &gt;&gt; Who sees? Who sees who sees the ses? [Music] &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; As we turn to the book of St. Mark the 10th chapter 13th verse. &gt;&gt; And they brought young children to him that he should touch them. And his disciples rebuked those that brought them. But when Jesus saw it, he was much displeased and said unto them, "Suffer the little children to come unto me, and forbid them not, for of such is the kingdom of God. Verily I say unto you, whosoever shall not receive the kingdom of God as a little child, he shall not enter there. And he took them up in his arms, put his hands upon them, and blessed them. And that's exactly what we can do. Amen. God bless you, Sister Ch. Oh, brother. &gt;&gt; Brother is now a grandfather. &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; All right. They put like this. What's the name? &gt;&gt; All right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Our gracious heavenly father. &gt;&gt; The Bible says the children are the heritage of the Lord. &gt;&gt; And Lord, we are standing here this morning as an acknowledgment that life comes from you. &gt;&gt; And you and you alone can preserve life. &gt;&gt; I'm standing here as a minister of the gospel to say a prayer over the life of this child. &gt;&gt; Amen. We don't know what the journey of life holds, &gt;&gt; but may it always be remembered that there was a minister of the gospel. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; That said a prayer over the life of this child. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; May the same influence that the parents have come under, may this child come under the same influence. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That later on when this child cometh of age, he she as well must say indeed I'm worshiping the God of my parents. &gt;&gt; Amen. Lord we appreciate you as we commit this life to you for the preservation in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you. Congratulations. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; All right, let's go to the reading of the way as we stand to our feet. God bless you musicians. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. We're going to turn to the book of John 1 verse one. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It reads in this manner. I'll give those that are looking to find it. In the beginning was the word and the word was with God and the word was God. The same was in the beginning with God. All things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was made. Amen. Amen. Verse 14. Verse 14. &gt;&gt; And the word was made flesh and dwelt among us. And we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the father, full of grace and truth. as we bow our heads. &gt;&gt; Our gracious heavenly father, &gt;&gt; amen, &gt;&gt; we appreciate you this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Lord, we first and foremost want to thank you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; For our pastor. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You have strengthened him. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You fought so many of his battles. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And that is why this morning we can say Jehovah is a mighty warrior. &gt;&gt; He's great in battle. &gt;&gt; You have never lost even one battle even one time. &gt;&gt; You are our five-star general. &gt;&gt; And that is why if you are on our side, who can be against us? No principality, &gt;&gt; no demonic power, &gt;&gt; nothing can stand before us. &gt;&gt; The scripture says, "Greater is he that is in you &gt;&gt; than the one that is out there in the world." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And that is why we want to appreciate you this morning. Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm standing here behind the holy desk &gt;&gt; to speak to speak to the bloodboard &gt;&gt; bride of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; It comes with such a responsibility and be gracious to me as you become gracious to them. &gt;&gt; Lord, may it be the operation of the Holy Spirit that through the preaching of the word, those that are sick, may they be healed. Those that are bound, may they be set free. &gt;&gt; Cuz Lord, we've got a commission that whatever we bind here on earth &gt;&gt; shall be bound in heaven. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And whatever we set free here on earth shall be set free in heaven. &gt;&gt; And right now under the authority of the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We bind every demon &gt;&gt; in the name of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; May God come and minister to the hearts of your people. All these things, dear God, we ask them believing in the most gracious name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you as you take the comfort of your seat. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I must say you sing very well as a church. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Brother Brenam says when we get onto the other side, We will sing all songs of Zion. And it says we will sing for 10 10,000 years. And it will feel like it will feel like just a song service. I don't know how many are looking forward to that time where the past battles are behind us. where sickness will never be there anymore. No, no old age there. We will be in the brilliancy of our youth and we will say well done my brother. Well done my sister. We made it against all odds we have. I don't know how many are looking forward. Whatever you do, don't remain behind. make sure that you make it to the other side. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; This morning I want to speak on Elohim operating in flesh. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Genesis 1 verse one verse one &gt;&gt; Moses he speaks there and wrote and said in the beginning God created the heaven and the earth and maybe the people that might have read this during the time of Moses they might have thought maybe Moses must have hit the climax next. But later on, John the Eagle, he comes, he goes beyond the beginning of Moses. He tells the people that there was the another beginning before this beginning. Then he says, "In the beginning was the way and the way it was with God and the way it was God." And people thought John must have hit a climax. But in the end time, there came a man. He went beyond the beginning of Moses. He went beyond the beginning of John. And he said let us go back at the back part of the mind of God. Let us go back to the time before God became God. Then we realize that now we are going to a climax. Then it says in Christ is the mystery of God revealed 102. He says now God's secret mystery he had before the world began now back at the back part of God's mind. When we say something is at the back part of your mind it means it's a very important. Hallelujah. Amen. The back part of the mind of a person is a very important area. THE BACK part of the mind is where thoughts are hidden. [Music] Now here is a man. He is going back at the back part of the mind of God. What what is he trying to locate? He wants to interact with God's thoughts. This is not for CHURCH MEMBERS. This is before the denomination. [Applause] Are you still with me? This is even before the devil was there. This is before demons WERE THERE. This is before God was God. THIS is when he was the self-existing one. There was no planet. There was nothing. BUT here is a man. He's locating God's thought. Now what does he find at the back part of the mind of God? He finds the bride. He finds THE ELECT. HE finds the PREDESTINATED this morning. We we had much better tell Satan. We had much better tell Satan. I'm not a believer FROM HERE. I'm not a believer because OF WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE. THERE IS NOTHING THAT IS HAPPENING that will change who I am. I was a believer BEFORE MY POVERTY. I was a believer BEFORE MY SICKNESS. I WAS A BELIEVER BEFORE THIS BODY. I WAS A BELIEVER BEFORE SATAN WAS THERE. I WAS A BELIEVER BEFORE DEMONS WERE THERE. SO I'M A BELIEVER FROM ETERNITY. AND I WILL BELIEVE GOD HERE AND I AM GOING BACK TO ETERNITY. AND THIS MORNING I'M SPEAKING TO THE PEOPLE THAT ARE UNSTOPPABLE. HATRED CANNOT STOP THEM. DECEPTION CANNOT STOP THEM. SATAN CANNOT STOP THEM. THESE PEOPLE ARE HEAVEN BOUND. THEY COME from God AND THEY'RE GOING BACK TO GOD. AND THIS MORNING I'M GLAD TO SAY I can say I'm glad I can say I'm one of them. &gt;&gt; Believers don't be distracted by what is happening in time space. When Job was distracted by what was happening in in the space of time, GOD COMES TO JOB AND SAY JOB STAND UP AND SPEAK LIKE A MAN. WHERE WERE YOU WHEN THE MORNING START SUN? WHERE WERE YOU WHEN THE SONS OF GOD SEARCHED FOR JOY? THIS MORNING, I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GOING THROUGH, BUT I'VE GOT A QUESTION FOR YOU. WHERE WERE YOU WHEN THE MONARCH SANG? WHERE WERE YOU when the sons OF GOD SHOUTED FOR JOB? THERE ARE PEOPLE HERE THAT CAN GIVE AN ANSWER. THEY CAN SAY BROTHER I WAS THERE AND THIS MAN I WANT TO SAY I WAS THERE I hope we are together at the back part of the mind of God you know I've realized uh you know we don't want to do mlas that I'm I'm your brother because it's ml I'm a sister because it's my blood. Let me tell you something. Some of us who are brothers and sisters in the mind of God. Amen. Some of us who are your pastors but your pastors in the mind of God. OUR PROPHET WAS OUR PROPHET AS A back part of the man. Jeremiah Jeremiah didn't become a prophet here. HE WAS A PROPHET BEFORE HE WAS FORMED IN HIS MOTHER'S BATHING. AND THIS MORNING, some of you, YOU WERE BELIEVERS BEFORE YOU WERE FORMED IN YOUR MOTHER'S BATHING. So don't be intimidated by Satan. [Applause] Then the prophet says, &gt;&gt; "Now God's secret mystery he had before the world began now back at the back part of God's mind. Hey, I'm I'm begging to move from this. I don't know whether people they have experienced what we call a djà vu is when you are maybe you're sitting with people maybe you are talking and you feel like this is not happening for the first time it's like we've been here before how many HAVE EVER EXPERIENCED THAT every time when I hear the prophet's VOICE when he say good evening friends I say this is NOT THE FIRST TIME I hear this voice. I've se I've heard this voice before. Then I realized that I didn't hear this voice here. I'm hearing it FOR THE SECOND TIME. THE FIRST time it was in the mind of God now. I'm hearing it here. But because I believed in that voice there, THEN I WILL BELIEVE in that voice here. Amen. He said there was something that he was trying and was going to achieve and he had a motive in doing it in in order to let himself be expressed because first there wasn't even a moon. There was not even a star. There was not even an atom. &gt;&gt; Let's give the brothers to help us. We going to preach. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The devil will not stop us. &gt;&gt; We going to preach. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then it says first there wasn't even a moon. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Or anything. He was God. Then he turns. It says, "But he exactly wasn't God at that time." Because God is an object of worship. There wasn't nothing to WORSHIP HIM. That's why we call him Elohim. Selexisting God. Now, now the prophet says, and this is where you are going to understand when the prophet says, "We I'm glad that when I die, I'm not going to become an angel." Because an angel is a servant and a servant is replaceable. But a son and a daughter, even if they can upset you, you can never replace your son. You can never replace your daughter. That's why when the when the oneird of angels never kept their estate, THEY WERE kicked out of heaven and they remain NO PLACE FOR THEM. SO THAT MEANS THEY ARE NOT REDEEMABLE. Satan is not redeemable. Demons are not redeemable. And God abolished THEIR ESTATE. But when a son fell, I can't stay here. I must follow my son. I must go INTO TIME. I MUST become come in a sinful form because without the son I'm not complete without the daughter. I'M NOT COMPLETE. HEAVEN IS NOT complete without you. Now &gt;&gt; the prophet say in the unveiling of God unveiling of God &gt;&gt; he says this is a part of his way this is the way that he manifest himself to us manifest the eternal uh no problem we'll give him we've got time amen And that's fine. How many appreciate the brother for helping us? &gt;&gt; Amen. [Applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is a he says this is a part of his way. &gt;&gt; This is the way that he manifest himself to us. manifest the eternal way God Jehovah made flesh like St. John 1. In the beginning was the way and the weight was with God. In the beginning was Elohim and Elohim became the way and that weight was Elohim and the weight was made Elohim. Then the prophecy is the same thing just unfolding. Then he carries on. He says like the attribute. He says see it is in God and attribute is your thought. God in the beginning the eternal he wasn't even God. He was the eternal. He wasn't even God. God is an object of worship or something. He wasn't even that. He was Elohim, the eternal. But in him was thoughts. He wanted to become material. He was not satisfied just to be a spirit. He wanted to BECOME MATERIAL. WHAT DID HE DO? Then he spoke the word and that word was materialized. And the prophet said that's THE WHOLE PICTURE FROM GENESIS to Revelation. There's nothing wrong. It's Elohim materializing so that he can be touched. And this MORNING I SAY ELOHIM can be touched. &gt;&gt; Are you still with me? This is this algebra is not for Pentecostals. &gt;&gt; You know there are denominations they appreciate that we say our father thou art in HEAVEN that is distant is day in heaven. But when we come in into into the message, we realize THAT SAME GOD can can coesend and he can pour himself into a human form and he can wear his suits and he can walk among us. He did it during the time of of of Jesus. He walked amongst them. And in our time, we have a man that came. HE TURNED HIS back and said there is a woman at the bed she's not from here she's from such and such place and this woman is suffering from SUCH AND SUCH IS AND THIS MAN SAID that woman CONTACTED GOD. NOW MY QUESTION IS THAT GOD WAS NOT IN HEAVEN BUT THAT God he took A HUMAN FORM AND THIS IS WHAT THE DEVIL HATES. WHEN GOD TAKES A HUMAN FORM ANYTIME YOU see God taking a HUMAN FORM, YOU MUST know that there's going to be a body change. DURING THE TIME OF ABRAHAM WHEN HE TOOK A BODY FORM ABRAHAM AND SARAH THEY BECAME YOUNG AGAIN DURING THE TIME OF JESUS WHEN HE TOOK A HUMAN FORM THERE WERE THE GRAVES OPEN IN OUR TIME HE HAS TAKEN A HUMAN FORM AGAIN IT'S NOT JUST GOD IN HEAVEN BUT ELOHIM CAN BE TOUCHED ELOHIM YOU CAN SHAKE HIS HAND HOW CAN YOU SHAKE HIS ELOHIM TODAY HE'S GOT A NEW VEIL. JESUS WAS A VEIL. BUT TODAY GOD HAS GOT A VEIL. HOW MANY BELIEVE THAT GOD HAS GOT A VEIL? AT THAT DAY YOU SHALL KNOW. YOU SHALL KNOW. YOU SHALL KNOW. AT THAT DAY WHICH DAY THIS DAY YOU SHALL KNOW THAT I AM IN THE FATHER. THAT WAS ANOTHER FOUR. AND THE FATHER IN ME. THAT'S ANOTHER FALL. AND I IN YOU, THAT'S ANOTHER FALL. AND TODAY WE ARE ON THE THIRD ONE. I IN YOU. &gt;&gt; IT'S NOT ME PREACHING TO YOU. IT'S I IN YOU. I NOT YOU RECEIVING THE MESSAGE. IT'S I IN YOU. &gt;&gt; JEHOVAH &gt;&gt; OF THE OLD TESTAMENT IS HERE NOW IN THIS DAY. HE'S WALKING THE STREETS OF MI. AMEN. [Music] &gt;&gt; I can shake the hand of God today. &gt;&gt; Amen. HOW DO I DO THAT? GREATER IS HE THAT IS IN HIM. GREATER IS HE THAT IS IN ME. AMEN. [Applause] Are you still with me? The Patmos vision vision &gt;&gt; brother says 1332. &gt;&gt; He said the greatest of all revelation the climax the high point is the deity supreme deity of our lord Jesus Christ. Why say this is the greatest? IT'S BECAUSE WHEN YOU see what he has done in Jesus, then you will know &gt;&gt; what he will do in you. &gt;&gt; Are you still with me? &gt;&gt; I hope we are together. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, brother Brendam, in your message, spiritual food in juice season, &gt;&gt; he says if he comes today looking like a hoffman, and having nail wounds. Brother says, "I won't accept him." He says, "Because it's not the season for that body." But he says, "If he comes in the form of my brother and the form of my sister, then I will accept him because it is the I in YOU SEASON. NOW we can tell the world. When they say show us the father, we can say we have been with you THIS LONG. WHAT DO you mean when you say show US THE FATHER? WHEN YOU HAVE SEEN US, you have seen the father. But you know why they cannot see the father? They must go beyond the veil. Are you still with me? Amen. The Samaritan woman. met Elohim in flesh. &gt;&gt; The prophet says in the message the future home, you know, God works in a paradoxical manner. Here is a Samaritan woman. Five husbands have gone by. Now staying with the sixth one. even ashamed to come to the well towards the evening time. She chose the midday where it was hot because she was a social outcast. They rejected her. Then she walked alone and went to the well. But she did not know that that day it was a different day. It was a divine appointment. The Bible says Jesus had to go by the way of Samaria. You know they used to bypass Samaria, go via Jericho and go to Galedia and come back to Judea because they avoided the Samaritans. They avoided the Samaritans. They didn't want to go through Samaria. But when God was in flesh, he said, "I'm going to break the protocol. I'm not going to bypass Samaria. I'm going to go via Samaria." What was happening in Samaria? There was a seed. There was a daughter of God. But this daughter of God, she had spiritual amnesia. She had forgotten who she is. She became a prostitute. BUT THEN JESUS went by Samaria. And when they came there, they met. And when they met, then Jesus says to the Samaritan woman, give me water to drink. And the Samaritan woman say, "It is not customary that we Jews should have this conversation with you. No, we are the Samaritan. And then he say only if you knew the gift of God and the one that is speaking to you will be the one asking me for WATER BECAUSE THE WATER that I'll give you will QUENCH YOUR THIRST ETERNALLY. NOW WHEN THEY WERE SPEAKING THE WOMAN SAID GIVE ME the water. And then the Jesus says go and get your husband and say I have none. I've had five. Jesus says you have had five. the one that you're with is not even yours. Right there, there was a there was a there was a realization that no, no, no, no, no. I've met men before, but this IS A SPECIAL KIND. THIS ONE WENT BEYOND MY BODY. This one WENT BEYOND MY SPIRIT. THIS ONE CAME IN CONTACT WITH THE CHIN OF GOD IN ME. THEN SHE REALIZED THAT WE KNOW THAT WHEN MESSIAH COMETH, HE WILL TELL US ALL THINGS. AND JESUS MADE AN ANNOUNCEMENT AND SAY, "I'M HE WAS NOT IN A CHURCH. IT WAS OUTSIDE THE CHURCH." THIS WOMAN WAS NOT A PRIEST. SHE WAS A PROSTITUTE. IT DOESN'T MATTER WHERE SON OR A DAUGHTER OF GOD THEY ARE. IT DOESN'T MATTER IN THEIR FALLEN STATE. THEY ARE STILL REACHABLE BY GOD. Do you remember where God took you from? You You were not BORN A BELIEVER. YOU WERE OUT THERE, BUT GOD LOCATED YOU. HOW DID HE LOCATE YOU? THERE WAS SOMETHING IN YOU THAT was waiting for the real thing. You were like a little igllet. You were walking with chickens and you WERE SCRATCHING THE SURFACE. BUT YOU SAY, "BUT THERE MUST be something deeper." &gt;&gt; I'VE GOT AN APPETITE &gt;&gt; FOR a blood dripping gospel. I NEED A GOSPEL THAT COMES FROM ETERNITY. AND GOD RAISED A PROPHET AND WENT AROUND THE WORLD SEVEN TIMES UNTIL THE message came YOUR WAY. AND WHEN THE MESSAGE CAME YOUR WAY, something moved on the inside of the inside. YOU HAD SERMONS BEFORE, YOU ATTENDED THE CHURCH BEFORE, YOU READ THE BIBLE BEFORE. BUT THIS ONE, IT PENETRATED TO THE SOUL AND YOU SAY, "NOW I MUST LEAVE THE OTHER THINGS." Because you realize that you're an eagle. The prophet says this little woman, had nothing to present, she was as filth as dirt as she could be. BUT NOTICE WAY DOWN IN HER, she's got representation. And then she was looking, brother makes a very very important statement. He say, "And then she was looking for THIS to be made flesh." I want to check what was he she waiting to be flesh. Now when he was Elohim, the Samaritan woman was there. She was an attribute of God. Are you still with me here? When he condescended and poured himself into the logos, &gt;&gt; the Samaritan woman had a representation THAT WAS A THEOPHONY. THEN WHEN THEY CAME INTO FLESH. HALLELUJAH. AMEN. Because they had a relationship there. THEY MET THERE. NOW AT RIVER Jordan at the at the Samaritan well. IT WAS A MEETING FOR THE SECOND TIME. The first MEETING WAS IN HEAVEN, BUT THE SECOND MEETING WAS AT THE WELL. THAT'S WHY the Samaritan woman COULD RECOGNIZE THAT THIS MUST BE CHRIST. ARE YOU STILL WITH ME HERE? EVEN as he was Elohim, &gt;&gt; we were attributes. HE PUT HIMSELF into the logos. Then we HAD OUR THEOPHANES. NOW WE ARE HERE ON FLESH. SO THIS MORNING I'M NOT TRYING to convince you &gt;&gt; to believe our MESSAGE BASED ON WHAT IS happening in the flesh. OUR MESSAGE GOES BEYOND THE FLESH. AMEN. OUR MESSAGE GOES BEYOND RIGHT AT THE BACK PART OF THE MIND OF GOD. AND LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING. IF WE FIND YOU THERE, WE WILL FIND YOU HERE. AND IF WE DON'T FIND YOU THERE, WE WILL NOT FIND YOU HERE. AMEN. &gt;&gt; You see, those that sleep in church must say something with us. I want just to them to testify that when they sleep in church, what happens to their theopa? Are you still with me? Amen. Because we preach to you theophony. The reason you ARE RAISING YOUR HANDS IS BECAUSE YOU ARE THEOPHONY. Raising the hand. THE REASON YOU say amen IS BECAUSE YOU ARE THEOPHONY. IT'S SAY AMEN. THIS MORNING. THE REASON YOU CAME TO CHURCH, SOME OF YOU, YOU HAD MANY REASONS, BUT SOMETHING PULLED YOU INTO CHURCH. IT'S YOUR THEOP. YOU ARE UNDER THE CONTROL and influence of your theoph says no more doubt. referring to the Samaritan woman. Amen. &gt;&gt; You didn't have to explain it. There are certain things. We don't need to explain that. Those that were meant to believe will believe. [Music] Elizabeth &gt;&gt; after she received the angelic visitation she rushed to Mary she couldn't go anywhere else other women would have never understood Elizabeth only Mary could understand Elizabeth AND WHEN MARY SAW ELIZABETH COMING Mary didn't bring MANY SCRIPTURES QUOTATIONS AND TRY TO DEBATE or Elizabeth. No, ELIZABETH KNEW ONE THING. THE SAME ANGEL THAT CAME TO ME IS THE SAME ANGEL THAT WENT TO MARY. SO MARY ALREADY BELIEVES WHAT I BELIEVE. AS SOON AS Mary or ELIZABETH SAW MARY, SHE SAID, "THE MOTHER OF MY LORD." [Music] AND MARY SAID, &gt;&gt; THE ANGEL SAID, "I SHALL have a son, and I SHALL CALL HIS NAME, JESUS, John the messenger THE FORERUNNER. HE WAS A DEAD BABY. BUT WHEN THAT NAME WAS UTTERED, JOHN THAT WAS DEAD, HE LIMPED WITH JOY. OUR THINGS CANNOT BE EXPLAINED. They must be believed. Amen. Amen. They say you didn't have to explain it. She saw it. &gt;&gt; She believed it. &gt;&gt; And she went away. &gt;&gt; WHY? WHAT did it do to her? It redeemed her. I I don't know. It's more like having a cell phone &gt;&gt; and your cell phone has got no network &gt;&gt; because you are away from the tower. But at the moment you come closer TO THE TOWER then you see the network bar loading one by one until it is fully loaded. And even you there was a time YOU HAD NO NETWORK THEN YOU CAME to me tabernacle and there was a tower pastor here then you came within the range of the TOWER THEN THE BUS STARTED LOADING. &gt;&gt; AMEN. Until it said connected. So, but your cell phone cannot load the network unless you've got a SIM card. &gt;&gt; We can put it in top OF THE TOWER. BUT IF it does not have a network, the B will NEVER MOVE. BUT YOU HAD A SIM CARD WHICH IS A CHIN OF GOD. &gt;&gt; AND WHEN YOU CAME CLOSER TO THE TOWER, AH, &gt;&gt; YOU GOT CONNECTED. &gt;&gt; CONNECTED. Are you not amazed that we can preach the gospel? Are you not amazed that we can preach the gospel? And your soul is on you having a jubilee. Another one is just even sleeping. &gt;&gt; It's a problem of network. [Music] I'm so you know when your phone gets connected &gt;&gt; it's just start downloading those that are in it they'll say it's connected to the cloud. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; And it downloads from the cloud. Even us, &gt;&gt; we are connected &gt;&gt; to the cloud connected &gt;&gt; and we are downloading from the cloud. [Applause] Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Somewhere I was told they've removed the pictures of the of the cloud and the pillar of fire. and they said it's confusing the people then I realized the church itself is not connected if you connected to that cloud connected &gt;&gt; you don't have a problem we have it in our homes we have it in our churches We can have it in our cars because what's happening the picture of our Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now the prophet carries on in the future home. He says, "Now here it was in this little woman. She was one of his attributes. &gt;&gt; There was the priest. He was representing the light. He had learned it from the Bible. He had learned that God was God. He had learned that holiness was right. He was learned, that there was a law of God. He had learned because of intellectual conception. He was born in the right lineage. He was a Levite but he only knowed by intellectual conception. But when the light of the hour he landed by what had happened, not what was happening. His denomination said nothing about it. Therefore, he had no representation of Israel. He he met all the credentials. He lived the right life, came from the right lineage, knew the Torah, but inside there was nothing. But here is a woman, a prostitute, a non-church member just moving around, but she had a representation. Maybe had much better say. Maybe I had much better say. You must not judge the book by its cover. Don't look at somebody and just write them off. You don't know what is on the inside. You know when we get to heaven, we will be surprised who we find there. Maybe let me just mess up your church theology. Here is a thief on the cross. Not baptized. Never been to a church. &gt;&gt; But now he's there. He's dying. Then he LOOKS AT HIM. BUT HE LOOKS AT HIM AGAIN AND SAID, "NO, NO, NO, NO. This is NOT AN ORDINARY MAN." HE SAID, "MY LORD, REMEMBER ME WHEN YOU COME IN YOUR KINGDOM." AND JESUS SAID, "TODAY, YOU WILL BE WITH ME IN PARADISE." Brother Bill, I can imagine when they get to paradise, they must have asked him, "Who are you? I'm just a thief. Were you baptized?" "Oh, I was not baptized. Why are you here?" But the Bible says to know him is life. The priest knew him. The thief knew him. And we MUST KNOW HIM. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; Let's come maybe in the stage of a perfect man of a perfect manag 300. &gt;&gt; Brother Brennham speaks &gt;&gt; and I loved how he described the meaning of godliness. [Music] He says, "What does goness mean?" He said, "I looked in four or five dictionaries and I couldn't even find what it meant." He says, "And finally I was down at brother Jeff there." &gt;&gt; He says, "We found it in a dictionary. &gt;&gt; Godliness means to be like God. So when we aspire for goodness, it means we want to be like God. And I want to take a few minutes to say what does it mean to be like God? You know I don't know how many of you have heard the prophet. He say had he been given a chance to choose in which age he was going to live in. He say he would have never chosen the time of Abraham. He would have never chosen the time of Isaiah. He would have never even chosen the time when Jesus was here. He says he would have chosen this time. What's special about THIS TIME? YOU KNOW in our time, brother Bill, Amen. &gt;&gt; God had gifts in a basket &gt;&gt; and he was giving them to the church. &gt;&gt; He gave the gift of divine healing. He gave the gift of tongues, gave all those gifts throughout the seven churches. But in our time, he went into the basket in order to give us something and there was nothing in the basket. Then God realized THAT OUR AGE, the giver must become the gift. So the Lord gave himself to a believer. Amen. &gt;&gt; Listen to the conflict between God and Satan. &gt;&gt; He says now 107. &gt;&gt; He says, "Now what is the word of God?" He said, "The word of God is God himself." So God gave the believer. He say amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Is God himself? &gt;&gt; He gave the believer himself. &gt;&gt; Amen. TO ATTACK THE ENEMY BY. So in OUR TIME YOU CANNOT ATTACK the enemy with tongues. You speak in tonesues then the enemy speak in tonesues. YOU PERFORM A MIRACLE, THE ENEMY PERFORMS HIS MIRACLE. BUT THERE IS ONE THING THAT THE ENEMY CANNOT IMPERSONATE. THE ENEMY CANNOT HAVE HIM. BUT IN OUR TIME, GOD GAVE HIMSELF. That's what the SCRIPTURE SAYS. THE LORD HIMSELF SHALL DESCEND. SO THE give the giver BECAME THE GIFT IN ORDER TO ATTACK THE ENEMY BY. NOW when the enemy IS COMING TO ATTACK YOU, SOME OF YOU YOU HAVE CONFUSED the enemy. He tried this, you are still worshiping. He tried that, you're still woriing. THEY DON'T GREET YOU, YOU'RE WORIING. THEY HATE YOU, YOU'RE WORIING. YOU HAVE NO JOB, YOU'RE WORIING. WHY IS BECAUSE THERE IS SOMEONE ON THE INSIDE OF THE INSIDE. AMEN. AMEN. [Applause] &gt;&gt; The Lord &gt;&gt; in the heart of the believer, &gt;&gt; he's carrying a believer. God is worshiping himself. In a believer, A BELIEVER HAS BECOME GOD'S TABERNACLE. God is WALKING ON TWO FEET. SOMEBODY CAN SAY I'M THE ADDRESS OF GOD IN 2025. &gt;&gt; I don't JUST COME TO CHURCH. &gt;&gt; I BRING HIM TO CHURCH. I TAKE HIM HOME. I GO HIM TO THE WORKPLACE. I GO TO THE UNIVERSITY WITH HIM BECAUSE HE GAVE ME HIMSELF. AMEN. &gt;&gt; BROTHER. &gt;&gt; YES, PASTOR. If we give you mangoes, we might run out or we might even run out of the patience to give you them. But if you can have a tree, you have everything. When you have him, YOU HAVE EVERYTHING. SO TODAY I'M PREACHING to people. THEY have him. Amen. And once you have him, you have reached a point of no return. Do you know that there are people they will never backslide? They will never go back to the world. They are here to stay. DURING GOOD TIMES, DURING BAD TIMES, THEY ARE HERE TO STAY. AND THEY SAY SOMETHING IS HOLDING ME. &gt;&gt; WHAT IS HOLDING YOU? &gt;&gt; HE himself is in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. Gave. God gave what? In our time. That means God in our time is material. Amen. Brother Brenham, &gt;&gt; Brother is in church &gt;&gt; and there's a young couple. &gt;&gt; They are busy doing funny things. &gt;&gt; And God says, the word says to the voice, &gt;&gt; you just speak the word &gt;&gt; and it will happen. If you can say die, they will pack them out. Brother says he stood there and he looked at them &gt;&gt; and he said, "I wonder if it was us." [Music] But because this was not just a son, it's adopted son. He's tested. He's got character. And character makes him fit to rule because power without character makes you demonic. BUT THIS ONE, HE WAS A MAN OF CHARACTER. HE SAID, "I FORGIVE YOU." Brother said, "At night, the Holy Ghost was pleased with me." What was happening? It's not him that forgive. It's because he himself. He was in the prophet. That's why he can forgive. And today, HE HIMSELF IS IN US. THAT'S WHAT THE SCRIPTURE SAYS. WHATEVER YOU BIND HERE ON EARTH SHALL BE BOUND THERE. IT MUST START HERE ON EARTH. WHATEVER YOU SET loose here shall BE SET LOOSE THERE. SO TODAY WE'VE GOT THE AUTHORITY. I saw we've got many prayer requests of people sick because he gave HIMSELF TO US AND HE IS IN US UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF THE WORD OF GOD. WE CAN DECLARE ALL THE PEOPLE THAT ARE SICK HEALED. AMEN. &gt;&gt; And you can say, "Who do you think YOU ARE greater than Solomon is here?" But he's in us. Amen. The prophet says, "And all things are possible to him that believeth." He says, "If you are the son of God, You're not like Z. &gt;&gt; You're like who? You're like God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You are like you love like God. You forgive like God. You are able to bear the burdens of other people like God. Because you are like God. and say he just speaks the word and it creates itself and his word is the creative power. If the church can only recognize who she is, the devil stands no chance. Maybe my brother while we are here &gt;&gt; bring this quotation in. How can I overcome? &gt;&gt; Quotation here. How can I overcome? &gt;&gt; Paragraph 105. &gt;&gt; Paragraph 105. &gt;&gt; If you had it &gt;&gt; 25th of August 90 1963 &gt;&gt; 1963 I want us to read it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The prophet says &gt;&gt; overcome. There are people that think that to overcome is when you pray a long prayer. No, no, no, no. Is when you first 40 days. No, no, no. Overcome means to recognize the David in every one of his tricks. Not many people recognize the devil's tricks. The prophecy a lot of people says there is no David. It's just a thought. He says, "DON'T YOU BELIEVE THAT?" THERE IS A REAL DAVID. He's just as real as you are or anybody. A real David. You must recognize HIM REAL. YOU MUST KNOW HE IS A DAVID. Then the same time that you recognize him, you know that that's a David and he's against you. This one we must tell you the devil is against you. The devil IS AGAINST THIS CHURCH. THE DEVIL IS AGAINST YOUR family because you operate from a different kingdom. Now he say that it's a when you and know that he's a devil, he is against you. Then to overcome, you must recognize THAT THE GOD NOT IN HEAVEN. THE GOD IN YOU is greater MIGHTIER &gt;&gt; THAN HE IS THAN THE ONE THAT'S IN YOU has already overcome him. AND BY HIS GRACE, YOU ARE MORE THAN A MATCH FOR HIM. This what I want to say to you. YOU ARE MORE THAN A MATCH AGAINST SATAN. IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT HE DOES BECAUSE WHY? YOU HAVE COME TO RECOGNIZE THAT THE ONE IN ME IS MORE MIGHTIER, IS MORE GREATER, IS MORE POWERFUL. THE ANSWER THAT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR IS NOT IN HEAVEN. THE DEITY IS NO LONGER IN HEAVEN, BUT THE DEITY IS IN YOU. NO WONDER YOU ARE THE DEVILS. You see the problem when you don't know who you are, &gt;&gt; you don't know at which level you can operate. If a man is a manager in a company, but he doesn't know that he's a manager. He can behave like a god. Are you still with me? The answer is recognizing who YOU ARE. Are you still with me here? And this is when I want you brother say when you come and recognize who you are, it drives the devil mad. Have you realized that the moment you recognize WHO YOU ARE? IT UPSETS A LOT OF PEOPLE. LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING. WE ARE NOT DOWN TROLLING PEOPLE. WE ARE NOT THE PEOPLE THAT SHOULD WALK AROUND with long faces. I want TO SAY IN THE END TIME GOD HAS FOUND A RESIDENCE. The God HAS FOUND A DWELLING PLACE. AND WHERE'S THE DWELLING PLACE? IT'S MY BROTHER. IT'S ME TOO. Brother says coming a time. He say if my field if there is no rain and my crops are burning because of the sun. I can go to my brother and say my brother I'VE GOT A PROBLEM ON MY FARM. I NEED RAIN. And my brother CAN SAY TO ME IN THE NAME OF JESUS CHRIST I GIVE YOU RAIN. DO YOU BELIEVE THAT? &gt;&gt; BROTHER BRENHAM asked sister, "Sister, WHAT DO YOU WANT?" AND SISTER SAID, "The greatest desire is the salvation OF MY TWO BOYS." BROTHER BRHAM SAYS, "SISTER, IN THE NAME OF JESUS CHRIST, I WHO IS HE IS GOD IN HIM?" GAVE SISTER HER CHILDREN. AMEN. [Music] &gt;&gt; Are you Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Most of the time we're better &gt;&gt; because we don't know who we are. You know me, I'm not afraid of a witch. No, no, no. Actually, which is the cheapest thing? &gt;&gt; Which is the cheapest thing? &gt;&gt; You know, in military there's what we call a signal jammer. If we put a signal jammer here, all your cell phones will not work. They won't pick up the signal because there is a signal there. So a son of God, a daughter of God is a signal jam. &gt;&gt; Are you not amazed that some of your relatives they don't want you to visit longer? It's because you jam signals. [Music] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. AMEN. WHEREVER YOU GO, YOU JAMMED SIGNALS. SO WHAT ARE YOU AFRAID ABOUT? SO WHEREVER YOU GO, you can say a signal has arrived [Applause] until we can't communicate, man. Network is a mess [Music] because the signal chamber is there. Go to back to your home and be a signal jammer. Go to your workplace and be a signal jammer. DON'T BE AFRAID OF ANYTHING. THE ONE THAT IS IN YOU IS A SIGNAL JAMMER. [Applause] [Music] &gt;&gt; Question and answers. Is that true? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Is the clock working? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Okay. Cuz some they only correct twice a day. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This one is correct all the time. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; The prophet says &gt;&gt; question and answers. &gt;&gt; Question and answers. &gt;&gt; Paragraph 62. &gt;&gt; Paragraph 62. It says when God created me William Brenham, &gt;&gt; I was made before foundation of the world. He made my being, my spirit. I wasn't conscious of anything as far as I know of. I was there. It says I don't believe you are getting it. He says now just a minute. Jesus told the disciples that he he knew them before the foundation of the world and Paul said here that he chose us in him before the world began. He said there was some part of me never &gt;&gt; and the rest of you all here that's in Christ Jesus before the world ever began. He say here's to my analysis of that. I think that the people today that are possessed with this spirit, I'm glad later he realized that people may not catch it and put capital letter S. Then he dropped it. He says or the spirit because you remember he said he was a spirit. And it says a part of the angelic beings. It says spirits which rotated [Music] &gt;&gt; of of God. So there are people here in them there are spirits and those spirits were not created because anything created has got a beginning and has an end. But there are people here they are the offshoot of God. Are you still with me here? They rotated of God. What does it mean? They as eternal. They as eternal as God is eternal. They are as supernatural as God is supernatural. There are people here that have got no beginning of days. I'm not referring TO THIS MAN, BUT I'M REFERRING TO THE MANY WITHIN THIS MAN. This one has got a beginning of this and has got the ending of this. But the one inside is the offshoot &gt;&gt; of MelkiseDC. &gt;&gt; Mechisedc had no beginning of days and the people that are of his offshoot. Are you hearing me? WHEN YOU DIE IN THE HOSPITAL, the you know you can they cannot call an undertaker before uptaker comes. &gt;&gt; There must BE AN THE UPTAKE IS ALWAYS FIRST on the SCENE that before the mivas come and take their part, let me go and TAKE MY PART. ONE PART, THE PART THAT ROTATED of him, THAT PART CANNOT GO INTO THE GRAVE. THAT PART WAS NEVER BORN. This this one was born. This one shall die. BUT THE ONE ON THE INSIDE IS renewed daily. Are you are you LISTENING TO ME HERE? DON'T WORRY ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS TO THIS. THIS ONE WILL GET SICK. THIS ONE WILL GO THROUGH TRIALS. THIS ONE WILL BECOME OLD. BUT THE ONE ON THE INSIDE WILL NEVER BECOME OLD. THE ONE ON THE INSIDE, THE DEVIL CAN NEVER EVEN REACH HIM. THE ONE ON THE INSIDE IS INFALLIBLE. THE ONE ON THE INSIDE IS INVINCIBLE. [Applause] I'M talking to SOME PEOPLE HERE. SATAN CAN NEVER DEFEAT THEM. I'M TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE HERE. THE DEVIL WILL NEVER PULL THEM OUT OF THE CAMP. They are here TO STAY. THEY WERE BELIEVERS THERE. THEY ARE BELIEVERS HERE AND THEY GOING BACK AS BELIEVERS. THE END time conditions. THE END TIME CONDITIONS. WILL NEVER CHANGE THEM. AMEN. But others, as long as somebody can go past them and not greet them, I'm not going to church NEXT WEEK. BUT OTHERS, WHETHER they greet them or they don't greet them, they will be here. Others, whether they have money or they DON'T HAVE MONEY, YOU FIND THEM HERE. WHAT IS HAPPENING TO THEM? WORSHIP IS NOT A SUNDAY ACTIVITY TO THEM. WORSHIP IS WHO they are FROM ETERNITY AND THEY ARE going back to eternity. Amen. If you can find a believer that is you know the only in the house Yeah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; That one. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; You know the area in the old area of a television in the house. &gt;&gt; Sometimes you need to move it around, put something and watch for few minutes. They say sh then you need to. Some believers are like that. Deacons must come. to put the signal. [Music] But there are others. It's connected. &gt;&gt; They are here all the time. &gt;&gt; And we appreciate God for those. Amen. Amen. I'm getting old. I'm used to be a very short preacher, but I'm getting old. [Music] &gt;&gt; But I want to show you a few things. Brother Brenham, brother, you know, brother Peter, &gt;&gt; a good driver &gt;&gt; knows The higher the speed, &gt;&gt; the higher they g. If you can drive 120 km on the N1, 120 km and decide to take from gear number seven and take it to one, what will happen to the engine? It will cease this problem. The church of God is moving on the runway. It's running at his feet. Some preachers, they want to come to the gear and take it to one. SO, WE ARE KEEPING THEM AWAY THAT WE can't go to gear one. We are done with the first pool. We can't go TO THE SECOND POOL. WE WANT TO BE ON THE THIRD POOL BECAUSE RIGHT WE ABOUT TO TAKE OFF. [Music] &gt;&gt; So brother Brennham Brennham when he was preaching you go and listen to this tape. &gt;&gt; Perfect faith. &gt;&gt; He prayed to almost over 100 people. &gt;&gt; I know it was more than 100. &gt;&gt; Amen. uh and he prayed for them in less than seven minutes. When you go and read in that book, Brother Brenam is not actually praying for them. They come through the prayer line. He say, "Sister, receive your healing. Brother, I receive your healing. My brother receive your healing." then they going through &gt;&gt; and I think those people must have wondered why is brother not laying hands. &gt;&gt; So he's answering what he was doing in that service. &gt;&gt; He says perfect faith 213 faith 213. &gt;&gt; He says this is coming into that third pool. &gt;&gt; I'm believing it. Amen. I want you to I want to ask you a sincere question. You that passed through the prayer line, can you actually believe and feel now that there is something something happened in you since you had hands laid on you? He was just touching them as they were moving somewhere where I'm going. He said, "There it is. This is what I've waited for. This is just starting to bloom now." He say, "I did this for a purpose. I did this for a purpose. I'M WORKING OUT SOMETHING." SEE, IT'S taking this charge of faith. Hallelujah. And going right back to begin. can come and see to kind of raise faith. He wanted to RAISE FAITH IN a bracket where you have never noticed that way before. Not a faith, not a faith, &gt;&gt; but a perfect faith. Build it up here. Then he carries on. He says the GREAT PHYSICIAN WHO is here who said this sign shall follow them that believe. If they lay the hands on the sick they shall come and if you say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart but can believe then he say if he can create schoolers who has no way at all or nothing that you believe. He say now listen to what he say it's my own faith that goes and does that my faith in what he challenged me to ask. He said he challenged me to ask and I received his challenge in obedience to HIS WORD. I ASKED IT and and it appeared. Referring to the squirrels, he said, "God in heaven knows that's true. Can't he also heal the sick?" He's telling the church that the squirrels came by the spoken word. Now, cannot the sick be healed by the spoken word? Then then listen TO WHAT HE'S SAYING. HE SAID, "IF HE can lift me with a faith up this way, even for the people, even if they can't climb to that bracket, if they can't do it, he can use my faith. He can lift me to THAT PLACE." AND the prophet say, "I am climbing for you. And that's WHY YOUR PASTOR CAN TAKE YOU INTO A HIGHER BRACKET where if YOU DON'T BELIEVE, HE BELIEVES FOR YOU. SO BROTHER SAY IF THEY can't climb, I'M CLIMBING FOR YOU. AND SAY I AM BELIEVING FOR YOU. AND HE SAY I'M SPEAKING FOR YOU. AND THIS ONE I WILL REPEAT IT. A MAN OF GOD WILL TRIUMPH FOR YOU. A MAN OF GOD WILL BELIEVE FOR YOU. A MAN OF GOD WILL SPEAK FOR YOU. THE PRIEST IN THE OLD TESTAMENT, the priest, he had the names of the tribes of Israel on his chest. and he used to go into THE PRESENCE OF GOD WITH THE NAMES OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL ON HIS CHEST. A REAL PASTOR HAS GOT THE NAMES OF HIS people on his chest AND HE GOES BEFORE GOD AND BELIEVES FOR THEM AND PLANS FOR THEM. ARE YOU STILL WITH ME HERE? AMEN. Is it 2021? &gt;&gt; Yeah, &gt;&gt; let me stop. God bless you. &gt;&gt; It was wonderful speaking to you. Shalom. Amen. God bless you. Never f me. &gt;&gt; Never. &gt;&gt; Jesus. Jesus.

Gracious eternal heavenly father, we want to thank you Lord this afternoon. &gt;&gt; Thank you Lord for bringing us this way &gt;&gt; to hear your word. Thank you Lord for bringing pastor Miva &gt;&gt; to come and address us. &gt;&gt; We want to give you all the honor and all the glory for you deserve them my God. &gt;&gt; Our hearts are bubbling with joy. &gt;&gt; We are going home a happy pupil &gt;&gt; because we have been addressed by our father. Thank you Lord for choosing us. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For making us the people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Of this time. &gt;&gt; Lord, the great secret that you had in the background of your mind, &gt;&gt; we are so happy &gt;&gt; to see it &gt;&gt; manifested &gt;&gt; in our day. It is no secret &gt;&gt; that the Lord that they were seeking &gt;&gt; is now in his tabernacle. &gt;&gt; And the Bible says, "Behold, that tabernacle of God is with men." &gt;&gt; They are no longer strangers. &gt;&gt; They are no longer foreigners. Amen. &gt;&gt; The Bible says he shall be their God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And they shall be his people. &gt;&gt; He will walk among them &gt;&gt; and they he will actually be in them. &gt;&gt; We thank you Lord for choosing us to live in this day and age. Thank you Lord for making us who we are. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is the time. This is the best of the times that anyone could live in. Oh God, &gt;&gt; to live where Elohim has run out of gifts in the basket that he chose to give himself the giver &gt;&gt; to be the gift. Oh, when the bride can just realize that who she is, &gt;&gt; if she can just come to a realization, &gt;&gt; hallelujah, &gt;&gt; that she is a signal gemma. &gt;&gt; I believe Paul had come to that point. &gt;&gt; And he said, is there anything that can separate us? Hallelujah. [Music] You have achieved my God, &gt;&gt; that which was in your backpack, &gt;&gt; that secret, &gt;&gt; that greatest secret. &gt;&gt; John could not get to that. Even Moses tried, but came a man who said, "Let us stand on the banister. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let us go way back there in the beginning just before the beginning. &gt;&gt; And he took us back &gt;&gt; and we came to our realization. &gt;&gt; Lord, thank you. &gt;&gt; Because this is the seventh seal. &gt;&gt; And when we see that happening, it's about time of change. When you see mechisedc in flesh, &gt;&gt; when you see Elohim in flesh, &gt;&gt; something is about to happen. &gt;&gt; We are looking forward to that day, oh God, because you are here in us. &gt;&gt; We are looking for that day when we shall meet you in the skies. Bless your children. Bless Pastor Miva. Be with him. Give him more inspiration. Oh God, thank you Lord for using him today. and bless your children. Heavenly Father, we go home victorious. Oh, he was asking what it is to overcome. We know what it is today to overcome. Our being godliness is being like God. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord. And heavenly father, we thank you for our pastor, &gt;&gt; pastor Israelima. &gt;&gt; May you be with him, heavenly father. May you strengthen him. Heavenly Father, it's a job well done. Oh God, raising men and women that are up to the standard of the message, the seventh seal. Oh God, we we ask for your inspiration. May you bless this pullpit, oh God. &gt;&gt; Continue to bless it. Amen. &gt;&gt; We we don't want to go as the pastor says
