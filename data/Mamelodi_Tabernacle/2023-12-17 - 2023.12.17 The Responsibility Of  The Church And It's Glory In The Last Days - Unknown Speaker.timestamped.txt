[19:19] before we left our various

[19:26] conversation with thee
[19:28] thinking Lord Almighty that we are going
[19:30] to a
[19:32] place there was a time when Abraham met
[19:35] you

[19:40] walk and you stood somewhere Lord you
[19:43] conversed with
[19:44] him and then the following days he woke

[19:50] place then he saw a Sodoma
[19:54] burning gracious Lord there was also a
[19:57] Time
[19:59] where Abraham went to a battle he fought
[20:03] a
[20:03] war and won that
[20:07] battle and then after winning that
[20:09] battle Lord you approached him and he
[20:12] had a communion with
[20:15] thee and you gave of yourself Lord
[20:18] Almighty so he never forgot that place
[20:22] and we know that that's where Lord

[57:37] [Music]
[57:40] 23 Paul says this I consider that our
[57:43] present sufferings are not worth
[57:45] comparing with the glory that would be
[57:47] revealed in
[57:53] US
[57:57] the creation waits in eager expectation
[58:00] for the sons of God to be
[58:10] revealed for the creation was subjected
[58:13] to frustration not by its own choice but
[58:16] by the will of the one who subjected it
[58:19] in
[58:23] Hope
[58:29] [Music]
[58:30] that the creation itself would be
[58:32] liberated from its bondage to Decay and
[58:37] brought into the Glorious freedom of the
[58:39] children of
[58:45] [Music]
[58:47] God we know that whole creation has been
[58:51] groaning as in a Pains of a child bre
[58:55] right up to the present
[59:09] time only so but we ourselves who have
[59:14] the first fruits of the spirit grown

[1:02:54] upon the glory placed in Us by
[1:03:00] God yet the Bible says he that has
[1:03:04] received
[1:03:06] much and much will be required of that
[1:03:10] one you know that the Church of the last
[1:03:14] days God has bottled
[1:03:18] everything everything that was to be the
[1:03:20] glory of
[1:03:22] God everything that was to be
[1:03:26] God everything that God
[1:03:30] was you know in the last days it is
[1:03:33] spoken of
[1:03:38] Kos God had said that I will restore
[1:03:41] everything that the Palma
[1:03:45] worm the canker worm the loc has have
[1:03:51] destroyed and he says after that rest
[1:03:58] the former rain shall come
[1:04:01] as which
[1:04:04] is and after the
[1:04:08] restoration verse 28 of Joel chapter
[1:04:14] 2 the Bible says and after that I will
[1:04:17] pour out upon every
[1:04:23] flesh and brother says on verse 28 the
[1:04:26] word utilized over there is a
[1:04:29] k so which means the Church of the last
[1:04:34] days God has rained down upon the church
[1:04:37] everything he had in his
[1:04:40] economy thanks to the because of this
[1:04:43] Glory we have thanks to this Glory we
[1:04:46] have a
[1:04:47] responsibility amen amen
[1:04:52] okay now that's the reason why the
[1:04:55] Apostle Paul says
[1:04:58] here it says that we know that the
[1:05:00] present pains and
[1:05:03] sufferings shall not be
[1:05:06] comparable to the glory that shall be
[1:05:09] revealed in
[1:05:11] us so which means the children of God in
[1:05:14] the days that we living
[1:05:15] in they have God's
[1:05:20] glory which has come through the
[1:05:22] revelation of the word
[1:05:25] you know that throughout the
[1:05:28] ages God alled a portion of the word for
[1:05:31] each
[1:05:34] age and that portion of the the word had
[1:05:38] its
[1:05:41] glory in the days of Paul they had a
[1:05:44] portion of the word and it
[1:05:48] glory in the days of irus the same
[1:05:51] portion of the word and it
[1:05:53] Glory in the days of Paul a
[1:05:57] thunderbolt in the days ofus a
[1:06:02] thunder so as long as the church is
[1:06:05] moving
[1:06:07] forward God is also botling himself
[1:06:11] in God is Bing himself
[1:06:15] out he pours the word and the glory
[1:06:18] there but to the last
[1:06:22] days to the last days God has say the
[1:06:25] fullness of the
[1:06:26] word and th the fullness of the
[1:06:30] word has come with the glory of God in
[1:06:33] the church hallelujah
[1:06:36] hallelujah that's why Paul
[1:06:39] says that all the
[1:06:44] creational animals the trees everything
[1:06:47] created by
[1:06:48] God we see them under
[1:06:53] expectations

[1:06:57] last day hallelujah
[1:07:00] hallelujah they're waiting upon this

[1:07:17] creation Hallelujah do you want to say

[1:17:49] Nazism were engulf communism in
[1:17:56] communism and when you shall see only
[1:17:59] the picture of

[1:18:05] admonished The Voice admonished to watch
[1:18:10] Russia watch Russ and keep your eye on
[1:18:12] the King of the
[1:18:14] North you know in the
[1:18:17] French when we say observe
[1:18:20] look it means study
[1:18:24] carefully
[1:18:25] see when you get to a
[1:18:28] place and somebody tells you
[1:18:31] observe it means to study the
[1:18:34] carefully so we have to study
[1:18:37] Russ we have to observe
[1:18:40] Russia and as we observe
[1:18:43] Russ only then we understand
[1:18:46] what and the
[1:18:49] second keep your eye on the king of
[1:18:52] North Russia
[1:18:54] it means
[1:18:57] something why do we have to keep an eye
[1:18:59] on King
[1:19:01] of so something must to be
[1:19:07] shown only laying my background for my
[1:19:12] preaching he says why atomic bomb are
[1:19:15] hanging over
[1:19:17] there it's a question
[1:19:20] why and the answer
[1:19:23] it is in the word it is in order to

[1:19:28] [Music]
[1:19:30] worlden
[1:19:32] amen why do we have bombs
[1:19:35] hanging the
[1:19:37] answer is to destroy the
[1:19:41] Earth
[1:19:44] says that Russia has got a
[1:19:46] bomb to destroy the United States and
[1:19:50] the entire
[1:19:51] world
[1:19:53] so then why are we coming

[1:22:14] quotation I just wanted to support the
[1:22:17] idea that I gave
[1:22:20] on these are questions that the prophet
[1:22:22] is
[1:22:24] asking why

[1:22:34] this now
[1:22:37] listen he says everything is expecting
[1:22:39] but
[1:22:41] what why isn't the bomb
[1:22:45] striking we we have to know
[1:22:51] why Russia does not have the
[1:22:55] trigger but the angel possesses the
[1:22:59] trigger it says it's just like a lot in
[1:23:03] the days of Sodom
[1:23:06] fire that was to destroy
[1:23:09] Sodom did not
[1:23:12] depend it depended on the angel of the
[1:23:15] but the
[1:23:17] angel could not to rain down fire of but
[1:23:21] as long as was
[1:23:24] there lot had to
[1:23:27] leave the angel may be able to the same
[1:23:32] thing when we hearing about

[1:30:47] availed but after the
[1:30:50] seventh the master the Mighty God
[1:31:00] unveil but don't forget
[1:31:03] this we have a
[1:31:08] responsibility look the nature the
[1:31:10] creation is
[1:31:12] waiting antop are waiting for you you
[1:31:15] know
[1:31:17] Brothers I'm trying to awaken the
[1:31:19] conscience of the church
[1:31:22] there was someone in the
[1:31:24] Bible by the name of
[1:31:28] gon he was a mighty man but without
[1:31:31] knowing
[1:31:32] it he was a mighty warrior not knowing
[1:31:37] it now he was
[1:31:39] there H he was there complaining if for
[1:31:42] God to be with us where are all the wers
[1:31:44] if for God to be with us where are the
[1:31:48] works the angel looks at the Gideon
[1:31:54] he the angel wondering he does not
[1:31:57] understand
[1:31:58] he does not see the glory in
[1:32:02] him the angel says I have to
[1:32:06] descend so the angel
[1:32:10] descended but notice that the angel
[1:32:12] brought nothing with
[1:32:15] him the angel only brought the message
[1:32:18] of Revival to G to say unto Gideon
[1:32:23] you have things in you g what what do
[1:32:27] you have in your in you you a mighty
[1:32:31] warrior in

[1:38:44] you sh you that are listening to the
[1:38:47] gospel three
[1:38:48] times when others never heard of The
[1:38:52] Gospel it is your responsibility
[1:38:55] hallelujah
[1:38:57] hallelujah we have such a glory right
[1:39:01] here we want the world to be attracted
[1:39:05] by we we are here for the
[1:39:08] departure we have to let others know
[1:39:11] that we are on our way there is a good
[1:39:14] land where there shall be no
[1:39:16] death where there shall be no de where
[1:39:19] there shall be no sickness
[1:39:22] Jesus has gone ahead to
[1:39:24] prepare tell the others hallelujah
[1:39:29] hallelujah how you feeling
[1:39:32] good let's move
[1:39:37] on now I am going very slowly one step
[1:39:39] at a time touching the of my
[1:39:43] message says all them people are
[1:39:47] waiting for the bride to get her
[1:39:50] position
[1:39:51] amen now listen to what he
[1:39:55] says
[1:39:58] says that they de in
[1:40:02] Christ they crying to
[1:40:06] God crying out to God lord still for us
[1:40:09] to go back
[1:40:11] on we need
[1:40:14] Resurrection this is what Paul say that
[1:40:17] the entire
[1:40:18] creation groans
[1:40:22] like in a in a birth of
[1:40:25] pain but they're waiting for the
[1:40:27] manifestations of the sons of God the
[1:40:33] adoption now I am going to touch on
[1:40:37] this even in the nature within the
[1:40:40] nature a true
[1:40:43] father does not just adopt any
[1:40:48] child it is true that you belong to him
[1:40:51] by
[1:40:53] birth but you only get adopted through
[1:40:57] character hallelujah
[1:40:59] hallelujah because
[1:41:02] adoption takes you out of the
[1:41:06] portion out of the
[1:41:10] inheritance that's why the adoption of
[1:41:12] the church
[1:41:13] today we are
[1:41:16] Beyond Divine
[1:41:19] Healing we are be Beyond laying on
[1:41:23] on we are Beyond everything that
[1:41:26] happened throughout the
[1:41:28] church because the church has
[1:41:31] grown the church has understood the
[1:41:36] responsibility when the child in a
[1:41:39] home understand that I
[1:41:42] after that after my father next in line
[1:41:46] is
[1:41:47] me so when the child understand that
[1:41:51] after my father is me I father when the
[1:41:54] father accept
[1:41:56] him this
[1:41:58] child he's well
[1:42:01] well with a good
[1:42:04] character so whatever I
[1:42:07] possess I have
[1:42:10] to his
[1:42:13] adoption depends on his
[1:42:16] character which our
[1:42:18] adoption depends on our character
[1:42:22] because when the father looks at
[1:42:24] hallelujah
[1:42:27] hallelujah that's
[1:42:30] why the responsibility of the church
[1:42:33] living the last days depends on that
[1:42:37] Glory that the glory of the
[1:42:41] adoption whereby God RS down on the
[1:42:44] church everything that he
[1:42:46] had as I
[1:42:49] said even the dead in Christ Paul Paul
[1:42:53] for example group and his group irus
[1:42:57] grou with his people through all the
[1:43:01] ages says day and night they cry out to
[1:43:05] God lord lord we want to go back lord we
[1:43:11] want to go back lord we want to go
[1:43:15] back but God says
[1:43:18] you for you to go back on the
[1:43:22] earth it does not depend on me as God
[1:43:26] but it depends on the church living in
[1:43:28] the last
[1:43:31] days you see the kind of
[1:43:34] responsibility to deliver the
[1:43:38] nature to unleash the resurrection of
[1:43:41] the Dead in
[1:43:43] Christ God is waiting on
[1:43:45] us now let's read brother
[1:43:49] Bram
[1:43:51] what was the Holy Spirit given
[1:43:53] for that's why I asked you a
[1:43:56] question of why we coming
[1:44:01] here the reason is for the dead in
[1:44:04] Christ to come back to
[1:44:06] life for the nature to be delivered it's
[1:44:09] not
[1:44:12] nothing it's not a little
[1:44:17] something they are waiting on us
[1:44:21] as soon as the church
[1:44:23] understand we're will to put an end to
[1:44:25] distraction to absent
[1:44:30] mindedness we have to dedicate ourselves
[1:44:33] for the
[1:44:35] cause then people are waiting on us
[1:44:38] that's
[1:44:42] brother if I can help somebody out this
[1:44:45] morning to be such a good thing listen
[1:44:48] to what problem says in the message what
[1:44:49] was the Holy Spirit G given
[1:44:51] for
[1:44:53] why what the Holy Spirit quation 50 to
[1:44:59] 51 I wonder if the version would be the
[1:45:02] same as in
[1:45:05] English I'm not going to be
[1:45:09] lengthy uh at uh at
[1:45:12] 12:30 but my
[1:45:15] message is a message of
[1:45:18] awareness of why we coming here
[1:45:21] what are we waiting for why do we have
[1:45:24] atomic
[1:45:26] bombs that's a a message of
[1:45:33] Revival it's the same holy
[1:45:36] spirit that save the
[1:45:40] lutherans that sanctify the
[1:45:43] method thatti the
[1:45:46] Pentecostals the same is here now
[1:45:51] in
[1:45:52] order to get ready the coming of the
[1:45:55] Lord
[1:45:57] Jesus the Same Holy
[1:46:00] Spirit but over
[1:46:02] there he was still
[1:46:04] [Music]
[1:46:06] weak it's just like a this glass of
[1:46:09] water F this a glass of field as soon as
[1:46:12] long as I keep it drinking it kind of
[1:46:14] getting
[1:46:17] decanted it's such a message of Revival
[1:46:21] why are we coming
[1:46:23] here what are we waiting
[1:46:26] for what is the nature Waiting
[1:46:29] For What are the in
[1:46:34] Christ that the same holy
[1:46:37] spirit that save the
[1:46:40] lutherans the very
[1:46:42] same that Sanctified Methodist the very
[1:46:46] same holy
[1:46:48] spirit that baptized the pente
[1:46:52] the same is
[1:46:53] here getting
[1:46:55] ready the coming of the Lord
[1:46:58] Jesus so now I
[1:47:01] want now I want you to follow carefully
[1:47:03] the
[1:47:06] next when it be so powerful this is how
[1:47:10] it is in the English so plain when it be
[1:47:13] so
[1:47:16] powerful the same holy
[1:47:18] spirit that saved all
[1:47:21] there that sanctify
[1:47:23] them got them baptized
[1:47:25] with when he comes in our
[1:47:28] midst when he comes in the Church of the
[1:47:31] last
[1:47:33] day this the church that has got the
[1:47:37] grand has got the huge
[1:47:43] Glory it be so powerful when that will
[1:47:47] be so
[1:47:49] powerful
[1:47:51] amen so today's holy
[1:47:55] spirit it's not the same as in the days
[1:47:58] of
[1:47:59] Luther it's not the same as in the days
[1:48:01] of Paul it's not the same in in the ages
[1:48:05] today powerful today the Holy Spirit
[1:48:09] must be so
[1:48:10] powerful today's Holy
[1:48:13] Spirit such a huge
[1:48:16] Glory because it is
[1:48:19] written who has seen that
[1:48:23] church in it a former
[1:48:28] glory so how do you see it
[1:48:31] now because the
[1:48:34] glory the glory to the shall be so
[1:48:38] Grand than the glory of the early
[1:48:44] church
[1:48:46] continues
[1:48:49] say
[1:48:54] as soon as you see the Holy Spirit
[1:48:56] becoming so
[1:48:59] powerful when it shall be so
[1:49:02] powerful this
[1:49:05] body
[1:49:07] yes
[1:49:12] that which means the Church of the last
[1:49:15] days this
[1:49:19] body will come into this

[1:58:54] day when the enemy comes in like a
[1:58:59] fly the spirit of God will raise his
[1:59:01] standard against
[1:59:03] it
[1:59:07] see 51
[1:59:10] 51 we we we are in another
[1:59:14] day back
[1:59:17] there were
[1:59:21] there
[1:59:22] wasn't half as smart as
[1:59:25] today even science
[1:59:28] Brothers it has
[1:59:32] evolved says in the days of my
[1:59:34] father my father they could be riding on
[1:59:39] Chariot but I in
[1:59:42] my I can drive my my my my my food my
[1:59:48] children go in a in a
[1:59:50] flight in the days tape they they use
[1:59:54] STS but now the smart pH but today we
[1:59:57] have
[1:59:58] [Music]
[2:00:01] smartphones science has evolved the
[2:00:05] church by the
[2:00:09] church science is moving
[2:00:12] forward today as you can see I might be
[2:00:15] here my my my car parked over there
[2:00:20] then remote control I just control it
[2:00:23] with my
[2:00:25] remote I can even started from here from
[2:00:28] a distance you see everything is moving
[2:00:30] forward
[2:00:32] evolving but what about the
[2:00:34] [Music]
[2:00:35] church
[2:00:38] says we have resources that we have not
[2:00:42] exploited
[2:00:44] [Music]
[2:00:46] yet responsility the responsib
[2:00:51] of the church living in the last
[2:00:54] days and its
[2:00:58] Glory we have a
[2:01:01] glory may we manifest That
[2:01:04] Glory now listen to
[2:01:06] brother
[2:01:12] says they couldn't uh they couldn't make
[2:01:14] an uh atomic bomb or
[2:01:18] automobile
[2:01:19] they didn't have science and things as
[2:01:22] we have
[2:01:25] now and things of mysterious
[2:01:31] things to try to say men are blow
[2:01:34] together by some D and
[2:01:37] so and to take some
[2:01:42] analysis and I tried to prove it to make
[2:01:45] infidels out of
[2:01:47] people one day in a
[2:01:53] in I preached at at the funeral
[2:01:57] of a propess of the
[2:02:04] university the professor of the
[2:02:07] university and abl man were there right
[2:02:11] before me iish the people and I told
[2:02:15] them you with your
[2:02:17] sence you are speaking of man's
[2:02:22] Evolution you say a man went from
[2:02:24] animals from dead pole to all the way
[2:02:28] to but let me ask you a
[2:02:31] question may you also prove the
[2:02:34] evolution of
[2:02:37] death how did it
[2:02:41] start yes okay let's believe that a man
[2:02:44] comes from a monkey but death where does
[2:02:47] it come from were they no one could
[2:02:50] voice
[2:02:52] out science cannot approve the evolution
[2:02:55] of
[2:02:57] death and I told them we all
[2:03:01] [Applause]
[2:03:02] dying we are dying today because all of
[2:03:05] us disobey the
[2:03:08] word in the beginning God
[2:03:12] say the day that thou shall eat of it
[2:03:15] that day you shall die and since
[2:03:21] death is the the chief consequence of
[2:03:26] Disobedience now science
[2:03:29] evolving what about the
[2:03:31] church this I'm speaking say it says but
[2:03:39] now when we need
[2:03:43] it the spirit of
[2:03:46] God raises a standard
[2:03:50] what is
[2:03:53] it he is pouring in his
[2:03:58] Spirit
[2:04:01] then those who are resting out
