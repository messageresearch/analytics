The reason father is that we bring our souls Lord almighty before thee and we believe gracious heavenly father that whilst we are singing your grace Lord almighty is coming down.

Father, you gave us a a divine promise, Father. &gt;&gt; And with that divine promise, Father, you will never shift away from it because it's your promise, Father. It's divine. And the prophet said, "Whatever might happen, but you will never shift from your promise. You promise us and you'll keep your promise, Father. Thank you, Father. And we invite you this morning, Lord, to come and stand behind this pull pit. And we invite you also gracious Lord that by mere entering into this building all those who are sick &gt;&gt; physically spiritually and whatever. Father may see your mercy and your grace. Father we thank you. Father, come and be with us, Lord Almighty, and speak to us like you spoke to those disciples when you were going to a mouse.

As we move forward, we don't have the baptisms, but if there's anyone that need to be baptized, we can see the deacons and they will assist you. And we have an upcoming event, the event on the 28th of February. the event for brother's 70th birthday celebration. We will continue to announce this event as we prepare to celebrate with our elder. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I have few announcement. that I'm going to read. The first one is related to the progress at Berland. I'm sure you remember some time ago they displayed the video of the bulerent and the plans that were given to us by the architecture. So those plans are still at the municipality. We expect to have approval as soon as possible. So currently they are circulating through relevant departments. So from time to time they give us feedback. So the feedback that we received was related to landscaping. landscaping which must be part of the submissions. So the trustees have assisted us with that. So the other one is for extra load bearing beams. Amen. The beams are the one that will carry the balcony. So we are busy obtaining coats. Those beams will be made of steel and will be covered in concrete. So the coring contractor is on site. waiting for the approval of the municipality. Once the municipality approve the plans, the cing contractor will remove part of the slab and the beams will be installed to carry the balcony. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The other thing is about the distribution box. So the electrical engineer gave us the codes to build the distribution box because the original one had to be moved to create the space for the believers. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. The second one is related to the sale of the Gamil drift plot. I'm sure you remember we had a plot that sight of drift. &gt;&gt; So the plot has been sold. Amen. Amen. It was sold in a cash transaction. So the plot has now been registered to the buyer. But the funds have not yet been paid over to the tabernacle because of the administration is incomplete due to some documents not yet submitted. So our auditors are helping us with those documents. Once they are done with the documents, the funds will be transferred into our tabernacle. So the trustees have put a deadline for the end of February. to complete the transaction. So it must be noted also that the sale was done through an estate agent agent and we also use the conveyor lawyers. So the funds are still with the conveyance lawyers. And later on it will be transferred once all the documents are complete. May the Lord richly bless you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. We are also grateful. &gt;&gt; We were approached by few brothers. requesting to clean uh the park outside. So the deacons gave them authority and the neighbors came and said thank you. So we really appreciate what the brothers did. May they continue to do the good work. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Uh remember we used to have a YouTube channel YouTube channel and the YouTube channel was closed. So the brothers have been working hard. to recover those messages that were lost. So we did a test run on Friday. So now we are pleased to announce that all those messages we are going to upload them again. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So we have decided to upload them every Thursday evening because Thursday used to be the day of the tapes. So every Thursday we will upload a full message. Then you can watch that in your respective homes. We continue to have our Wednesday services but on Thursday we upload a full message that we lost in the previous channel. God bless you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We are also blessed this morning. Truly blessed. We have a friend of the pastor all the way from Matad. Amen. Amen. He came to say shalom to the church. Shalom. H just to remind you remember the picture of light. It was taken at Sabino Canyon Tabernacle Tabernacle in DRC Mati Mati. &gt;&gt; That's where Pastor Dango is. He is the one that invited the pastor and during that visit on the 3rd of July 2012 July 2012 during the evening service when the pastor preached the sermon titled perfect presentation perfectation. After that service A supernatural light was captured around the past. God confirming the ministry of pastor Israel. So we are truly blessed. The pastor is here to say shalom. Shalom. And the pastor is not alone. The pastor is with the bride. So I will ask sister just to stand &gt;&gt; just to say shalom shalom. &gt;&gt; And may the Lord richly bless you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm told today we'll be going back on the 30th. So, we still have an opportunity just to say shalom to the pastor. Shalom. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm going to ask our precious pastor to come and greet the church. I will also ask brother David Katanga to come forth to assist with the interpretation. &gt;&gt; Do you love our pastor? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Can you just sing a song to welcome our pastor? God bless you. &gt;&gt; Rock of agees for me. myself in me. Oh, let me remember from my pre Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I greet you all in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Just like just said, &gt;&gt; I'm coming from the DRC. This is not the first time for me to be here. I believe the patriarch &gt;&gt; had allowed me to preach here I think three times and just before he left us to go and be with the Lord &gt;&gt; when he was sick. And when he recovered, &gt;&gt; he called me &gt;&gt; because when he passed at our church, &gt;&gt; where this supernatural picture was taken You can only understand the supernatural if you are really in that place. Brother was there. &gt;&gt; It was a meeting with a very superior anointing. We felt the presence of the Lord during the service. &gt;&gt; Not only this, not only this picture. But there were some other supernatural events that followed. We had in our church &gt;&gt; a young couple that was married already, &gt;&gt; but they had no children. They went to see doctors. Myself, I had prayed for them. &gt;&gt; They spent a lot of years together without children. And when the pastor arrived in Matadi, I said to him, "We can put you in a hotel. But because I feel that you are a very supernatural and special person, &gt;&gt; I saw it fit for me to put you in my bedroom. &gt;&gt; Hello. He was surprised, &gt;&gt; but he accepted the offer. It is not a good house. A very good house. His house this side is much better than that house. My house back then. And I could imagine how comfortable was his bed home compared to mine. But he accepted without doubt to sleep in my bedroom. &gt;&gt; So yeah. So I took an opportunity. So I called that sister who could not bear children. After after that day when that picture was taken after the service, we had our breakfast in the morning &gt;&gt; while he was still resting in the bedroom. I went and knocked at the door. &gt;&gt; I think those those two sisters were there. &gt;&gt; Yes, they were there. And then I asked him to come out and I said to him that this sister cannot bear children. She has a serious problem. &gt;&gt; Would you please pray for them? He didn't make a long and special prayer. He just made a very simple prayer. And the following month, &gt;&gt; that sister was pregnant, conceived &gt;&gt; and she had a child &gt;&gt; and ever since she added another child. Now they in Canada and that child is a grown up now. That is why pastor for me I call him the patriarch. &gt;&gt; That is why when he called me he said to me was organizing meetings month of December. He called me uh via his son-in-law. &gt;&gt; Yeah, son-in-law. Yes. &gt;&gt; So the son-in-law spoke to me and said that we are organizing meetings for December &gt;&gt; and they sent us invitations. While we still preparing to come, the Lord decided otherwise and took him back home. It made us very sad &gt;&gt; in the church as well as at our homes. &gt;&gt; We were very certain, &gt;&gt; but there's nothing that we can do. We are Christian. It's a man that fought and he died with a sword in his hand. I want I really wanted to attend the funeral &gt;&gt; but it wasn't possible because I was not given the visa but I made sure to get a visa. Uh that's why because I had an issue on my left eye. &gt;&gt; I decided to come and share that sen together at least for one day. That is why I'm here with my wife because the Bible says to us Cry with those who cry and rejoice with them that rejoice. &gt;&gt; That is why we present to you our condolences. Is not dead. Just changed the wedding place. If we had enough time, we could speak about this mystery. &gt;&gt; But maybe God will give us an opportunity to speak about it. &gt;&gt; You know the world in which we are living, it's a world where people are constantly changing habitations. Things keeps on changing. &gt;&gt; Things keep on changing. &gt;&gt; And this is not our dwelling place. &gt;&gt; This is not our house. &gt;&gt; This is just a temple. We are here just for a little while. When the work is done, &gt;&gt; we have to move out. We have to leave this house to go into a better house. That house pastor spoke a lot about that house. That is how I feel. That is why. May the Lord be blessed &gt;&gt; because he has taken his servant to go and rest. Hello. &gt;&gt; I just have a small word to tell you. &gt;&gt; Just a very small word in Matthew chapter 26. &gt;&gt; If you we can read it together. &gt;&gt; Matthew. Matthew 26 &gt;&gt; verse 31. &gt;&gt; Matthew 26 verse 23 &gt;&gt; 31 31 31 &gt;&gt; and then Matthew chapter 28 &gt;&gt; verse 7 &gt;&gt; and verse 16. And uh the last scripture will be &gt;&gt; the book of act &gt;&gt; okay the book of Matthew 26:31 says then said Jesus unto All you shall be offended because of me this night. &gt;&gt; For it is written, &gt;&gt; I will smite the shepherd, &gt;&gt; and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad. But &gt;&gt; but after I am risen again, &gt;&gt; I will go before you into Galilee. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Notice here every man before dying, &gt;&gt; they always say their last words to the family. And those words that they attach to their families, &gt;&gt; those words the family can never forget them. They keep them. They keep them seriously. Jesus was about to die. &gt;&gt; He left them with this last word &gt;&gt; and he said, &gt;&gt; "Today, &gt;&gt; I'll be for you. I'm &gt;&gt; sorry. Can you please Matthew 26:31?" &gt;&gt; Yeah. So Jesus said to them that all shall be offended because of me this night. &gt;&gt; For it is written, &gt;&gt; I smite the shepherd, &gt;&gt; and the sheep of the flock shall be scattered abroad. But notice &gt;&gt; smiting him didn't mean that they had to smite him physically &gt;&gt; and he had to run away and sheep would be scattered but he was announcing his departure. So the passing on of the shepherd who was Jesus himself. He said &gt;&gt; that Satan will be will do all for the ship to be scattered after my departure. &gt;&gt; But notice Jesus himself who is announcing this &gt;&gt; he says but you &gt;&gt; do not be dismayed. remain united. &gt;&gt; Remain together. &gt;&gt; Go to Galilee. &gt;&gt; Me. When I will die, &gt;&gt; I will resurrect again. And I'll find you in Galilee united together. So what I'm about to tell my this morning The shepherd is gone. &gt;&gt; But remain united like one man. &gt;&gt; Remain united like one man. &gt;&gt; There is a strength behind unity. That is why you will notice &gt;&gt; in chapter 28 of Matthew, &gt;&gt; he says to them again, &gt;&gt; chapter uh Matthew 28 verse 7 when he when he resurrected, he met certain women. &gt;&gt; And then he said to those women, &gt;&gt; notice what he said. and go quickly and tell his disciple that he is risen from the dead. &gt;&gt; And behold, he goeth before you into Galilee. Notice in that in Galilee, he sent them to Galilee to be united. And when he had risen, He followed them in Galilee to find them united. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He insisted on unity. &gt;&gt; Notice these women went to tell the disciples Jesus found them dead. And notice when he found them there, &gt;&gt; verse 16, Jesus said to them, "Then the 11 disciple went away into Galilee into the mountain where Jesus had appointed them." &gt;&gt; Jesus went to find them united together &gt;&gt; and they said to them, And then in act &gt;&gt; he recommend to them. &gt;&gt; He recommend to the disciple chapter one. He says to the disciple, &gt;&gt; verse four, "And being assembled together with them, But wait for the promise of the Father, &gt;&gt; which said he, "You have heard of me." He sent them to Jerusalem to be united into one place and wait. But notice &gt;&gt; chapter 1 verse 14 &gt;&gt; verse 14 he says &gt;&gt; this all &gt;&gt; continued with one accord &gt;&gt; in prayer &gt;&gt; and supplication &gt;&gt; in one accord in prayer &gt;&gt; with the woman &gt;&gt; and Mary, &gt;&gt; the mother of Jesus &gt;&gt; and with his brethren. Notice that all of them were all together. And in those day Peter stood up in his disciples. And the number of men of of names together &gt;&gt; were about 120. &gt;&gt; They were all united together. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They were all united together. &gt;&gt; And the book of Actapter 2 and the day of the Pentecost. They were all in one accord. He done one place. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Still united together. &gt;&gt; So after the departure of the church, you must do all in your power to remain united together. Respect. Respect the man that has worked with him before &gt;&gt; who are guiding you. &gt;&gt; Obey in those men. &gt;&gt; Listen to the word of God and you will realize that with unity you'll always go forward and forward and forward. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. preach a message &gt;&gt; unity. &gt;&gt; In that message &gt;&gt; in paragraph 15 &gt;&gt; I'm finishing now the prophet says this. It's a message that he preached on the 11th of February 62 &gt;&gt; united with God &gt;&gt; 11th February 62 &gt;&gt; paragraph 15 &gt;&gt; every man with his family &gt;&gt; infamy correct &gt;&gt; a correct Family &gt;&gt; born. &gt;&gt; Good. &gt;&gt; No, &gt;&gt; noble. &gt;&gt; Obisant. &gt;&gt; Obedience. Obedience. They are always united &gt;&gt; in bonf &gt;&gt; a good family &gt;&gt; noble &gt;&gt; correct &gt;&gt; correct &gt;&gt; just &gt;&gt; they are always united one &gt;&gt; one another &gt;&gt; they always united &gt;&gt; if in the family something separate the people something separate the people correct And so that is not correct. &gt;&gt; You must always avoid the splits and divisions. &gt;&gt; It continues the family. If there are divisions and separation The family is broken somewhere. &gt;&gt; They should always be one. &gt;&gt; The father and the mother. &gt;&gt; The mother and the father. &gt;&gt; The children and parent. &gt;&gt; Parent with children. &gt;&gt; All. in one accord. &gt;&gt; When you see that, &gt;&gt; you've got a beautiful image. &gt;&gt; That is the purpose of God. &gt;&gt; So this is my small exhortation. &gt;&gt; Remain united. Continue to love the message. Love one another and the Lord will bless you. &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; God bless you my precious pastor. As we stand on our feet, &gt;&gt; can we just clap hands for the Lord? Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let us stand on our feet &gt;&gt; in respect of the word of God. &gt;&gt; We are now going to welcome our precious pastor. May the Lord richly bless you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. of the voice of the angel when he Jesus should be finished as he has he to the prophet. Behold, I will set you the light of the prophets before The hearts of the fathers to the children of the children to the father. Bless our God. Bless you. All his we holy ghost. Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; I greet all the children of God this morning in the precious name of their master. the Lord Jesus Christ. I'm happy to be here this morning. After Elder Mete phoned me that we have got a visitor here, I said, "Well, I will never come there. the visitor will took over. But he said, "We have got some children of God who wanted to see you and they will be waiting for you." Because if you don't come this weekend, then it will be another weekend. &gt;&gt; Then you have to come. That's why you see me here. I'm happy. I'm happy happy. I'm happy also to to welcome my pastor here. And I also happy to receive his warning and advises when he when he is advising the church. &gt;&gt; You can sit down for a while. Hallelujah. Amen. Somebody said you were here last year. Um, it's a long time. Well, I'm here this year. God, God bless you. H there is I I was supposed to see two family and one brother in before the service &gt;&gt; and I I I wanted to flesh the cood but but I will not flesh it &gt;&gt; because of time. um they wanted to come and worship. Then I wanted to show you what the prophet said about that. But uh because of the place we slept, they delayed me so much so that I couldn't catch time. So perhaps I will see them after the service. Then I allowed them to be in the service with us and they will be in the service with us. Don't wonder when you see them. I think is brother Al's son &gt;&gt; and then brother I think something like that they are they are among us here don't don't don't be surprised when you see them they have told me about that then I will talk to them and then see how to help them because God want us to help one another. That is that is his that is his aim that while while standing on our feet because I don't want to waste your time. Let's read the book of uh Matthew chapter 13 uh verse uh 24 to 30 &gt;&gt; uh verse 24 &gt;&gt; to 30 &gt;&gt; then um um we're going to read Revelation 7 &gt;&gt; Remen Vers 7 to 9. &gt;&gt; Verse 7 9 Matthew 13 from verse 24. Another parable put he forth unto them, saying, "The kingdom of heaven is likened unto a man which saw good seed in his field. But while men slept, his enemy came and sought tears among the wheat, and went his way. But when the blade was sprung up and brought forth fruit, then appeared he appeared the tears also. So the servants of the householder came and said unto him, Sir, did not thou saw good seed in thy field? From whence then has it test? He said unto them, An enemy have done this. The servant said unto him, "Will thou then that we go and gather them up?" But he said, "Nay, lest while you gather up the tears, ye root up also the wheat with them. Let both grow together until the harvest, and in the time of harvest, I will say to the reapers, gather ye together first the tears, and buy them in bundles to burn them, but gather the wheat into my ben." Let's read Revelation 12:7. Revelation 12:7. And there was war in heaven. Michael and his angels fought against the dragon. And the dragon fought and his angels. &gt;&gt; Verse 7 to9. and prevailed not, neither was their place found anymore in heaven. And the great dragon was cast out, that old serpent called the devil and Satan, which deceiveth the whole world. He was cast out into the earth, and his angels were cast out with him. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's do our eyes as we pray. De Father, thank you for granting us this privilege this morning. Your children are gathered here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Waiting for you to speak to them. &gt;&gt; I'm standing here in your place. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; With my brother here. &gt;&gt; Amen. We humbly beseech thee to use my voice and my brother's voice. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Convey your message to your children. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The message you have for them this morning. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ we pray. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You may take your seats. I'm going to have a very short message God willing. The topic will be &gt;&gt; be settled and know who you are. And if you know who you are, &gt;&gt; you'll be settled &gt;&gt; when you take your car to the service. &gt;&gt; Um sometimes they will phone you. They say we are servicing your car into this plan here. We have seen something also that your rear bricks, your rear bricks, they're finished. Can we replace them? Then perhaps you say no later when we are here. We are in the service. Amen. &gt;&gt; And you are here to be sav to service somebody. You are going to be saved. The service is going to be is going to be to you are going to be service yourself. You must listen the message and bring it to yourself. Not to somebody. After you after you have refused the garage to change your bricks, when you are following another car, When you come to the stop sign, when the the front car stops, when you try to stop, your brakes fails, then you bump against the front car, then you are going to pay more because the insurance of that car insurance, they will want money from you so that you can repair the car, but you should have allowed the garage to replace your brakes. Then you wouldn't have this problem. You must allow the garage today to replace your bricks. You must not refer it to next. I said, "I'm holding a mirror." &gt;&gt; I'm holding a mirror. Then I bring the mirror to you. You look in the mirror. What kind of a person is in that mirror? If you find yourself in that mirror that you are not dressing well, dress well. Don't blame the mirror. This mirror makes me like this. When I preach here, I'm not targeting any individual. I say be settled. Know who you are. You see when Cain and Abel &gt;&gt; when they were bringing their &gt;&gt; sacrifice they they have not talked together. It just come to them but they must go and worship. They worshiped according to what was in their hearts. Abel was not worried about Cain's sacrifice. He was doing his. &gt;&gt; But the problem was with K. He always look at a sacrifice. And when Abel sacrifice when God received Abel sacrifice was not worried about what is happening at Cain's place was sure of what he was doing. You must be sure of what you are doing. Satan might say you are not the child of God because of this and this. You must tell Satan, I am the child of God. You must not allow him to deviate you because of this and this. You seem not to be the child of God. Because if you are a sheep following the goats, you may act like the goats, but you are not a goat. But when they say to you, Don't go this way. Take this way because your nature you are not the goat. Then you will turn. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Bible here speaks about two sers who were sewing two different seeds. Amen. In the same field. And the Bible also tells us who those sers were. And the Bible also tells us who those seeds were. They were different. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You see the the prophet says a thistle a thistle &gt;&gt; cannot help to be a thistle. It is a thistle to start with. I said, &gt;&gt; you see, when Cain and Abel were bringing their sacrifice, the problem was inside. &gt;&gt; The problem was their seat. They were from different seats and Abel couldn't help Kane and Cain couldn't help Abel because they were from different things. Then the the Bible tells us that the first Ser was God himself and the second was Satan but they saw their seed in the same field. He says here &gt;&gt; if the brothers can flesh something there &gt;&gt; in the book of um seat is not the seed of discrepancy. &gt;&gt; If they can fly something we can go on. If they don't have it we will go on. It is what the prophet says here. Paragraph 20 to 26. &gt;&gt; Paragraph 20 26. &gt;&gt; He says here, notice who he said that the ser were also what the seed was. One was he the son of God. who went forth sowing seat. An enemy came behind him which was the devil and saw the seed of discretion behind the sewing of the right seed. Now friends that has happened through every age since we have had the world exactly all the way from the beginning. It started the very same thing. He set the seed of God The word of God. &gt;&gt; Jesus said in a certain place that the word is a seed and every seed will bring forth of its kind. And now if the Christians, the children of God, the children of the kingdom has become the seed of God, they must be the word of God. The word of God manifested in the age they are living in. for the promised seat for that age. God gave his weight at the beginning and each age has has had its seat and its time and is promise. When Noah come on the sin, he was the seed of God for the word of God for that age. Don't forget that there were also another seed. We find them in the the book of first Peter chapter 2 there first and they say they are angels who were disobedient. They say they were ministers. Noah was preaching and they were also preaching. In other words, those seats were there in each age. Each age has got the seed of God and each age has the seed of Satan. Then you must be settled and know who you are in this age in the age you are living in. Look in the word of God. Whether you are going according to the way because if you are his seat, you will go according to his way. But if you are not his seat, you will go according to someone's way, not his, not his way. Amen. because his seat &gt;&gt; he said something here. Let me read it before I let me leave it there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The same the the prophet the prophecy the same Holy Spirit but let me start there each seat through different each each seat &gt;&gt; though different though different They will utilize the same earth and they will utilize the same nourishment and they utilize the same moisture. They will utilize the same sunshine but they will bring their own food. They will never bring different fruit. Although they are receiving the same even if they receive the same message but they will bring their different fruits because they are different seed that is what the prophet says it's not what I'm saying here the same holy spirit that anoints the church that gives them the desire to save souls that gives them power to perform miracles. It will fall on the just and the unjust. So we must not look at miracles. We must look at the word of God whether this thing is according to the word of God. And if it is if it is according to the word of God, we must say amen to that. Amen. But if it doesn't go according to the word, we must stand. He says here, And when they do the same genuine thing, BUT THE PROBLEM is the inside. The anointing is the same. They speak in tones. This one speak in tones. This one speak in tones. This one perform miracles. This one perform miracles. BUT THE PROBLEM IS THE INSIDE. But if you cannot if you cannot be careful, they will deceive even the elected. Because it seems as they are doing the same thing but the problem is the inside. Cain came to worship with the wrong seat inside the seat can't stop you to worship. You will go and worship. It depends what seed is in you. But when I'm teaching here, don't let Satan say to you, you are the wrong seat. You must you must RESIST THE DEVIL. HE WILL FLEE AWAY. When he said to you, you are the wrong seed. You must say no, I am not. Amen. &gt;&gt; That is the the flesh did there. He said, "But notice Cain come to worship, but he had the wrong seat in him, the serpent's seat. We know that." But he came to worship. &gt;&gt; We see these ones here &gt;&gt; in the end time. &gt;&gt; My brother, you can read Matthew chapter 7 &gt;&gt; verse 21. &gt;&gt; Verse 21. &gt;&gt; When you flesh seven church ages, seven church ages. Matthews 7 21 not everyone that saith unto me Lord Lord shall enter into the kingdom of heaven &gt;&gt; but he that doeth the will of my father which is in heaven &gt;&gt; it says there &gt;&gt; not everyone &gt;&gt; who says to me &gt;&gt; Lord Lord &gt;&gt; shall enter the kingdom But he that doeth the will of my father, which is in heaven, many will say to me in that day, which day is day, many shall say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? in thy name have cast out the devils in thy name done many wonderful works and then will I prophesy unto them. I never knew you depart from me that work iniquity. Jesus does not deny that they did mighty works, that only the Holy Ghost can accomplish by way of man. But he did deny ever knowing them. They weren't backsliders. These were wicked. and regenerated reprobate. &gt;&gt; This were the seat of Satan. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They've done this wonderful works. They came even before the Lord that we have done this. He didn't deny that. He said you have done it but you are of a wrong seed. I don't know you because you are not sown by me. &gt;&gt; There are people in our age. Brother Bren speaks about the beatles. He says those Beatles they were wicked but they were doing wonderful works. He said I just reading in the media. Okay. He said, "I just want to show you that the hour that you are living in is shocking. You might not understand it, but people try to understand it. What these things are? I've asked brother Cap. Brother Keaps read the article on the Beatles. The Beatles. &gt;&gt; The Beatles wonder about themselves. The Beatles &gt;&gt; and not they throw no answer. They are root. They are profane. They are valka. They have taken over the world. In Australia, for example, time we would arrive at an airport. When the prophet arrived at the airport, the road were lined solid. Cribles threw away their sticks. Sick people rushed up to the car. as if as if a touch from one of the boys would make them well again. Old women stood watching with their grandchildren. All these people were happy, relief as if somehow something better is is is here. Now you can't now you can see that you can't put your trust in healing campaign. You can't put your trust in any kind of science like that. The only thing you can put your trust in is thus sayaith the Lord from the Bible. Now church that is exactly where I have tried to keep you my children. If something happens to me and God takes me out of this earth, don't you never fail. Remember this with all your heart. Stay with the weight. Don't live that way. Anything contrary to it, leave it alone. No matter what it is, then you know it is right. Amen. &gt;&gt; He said, "I've told you stay with the way. Don't look at this miracle, but stay with it." What does the word say about that? If somebody says something, you might say, "What does the word says about that?" This seed of Satan, this seed of Satan, &gt;&gt; they are sometimes called fallen angels. Amen. &gt;&gt; Or Satan's angels. Amen. Brother Brennham says in this book here, he says they are even here in Jefferson these fallen angels. &gt;&gt; Let me just read something here. In other words, when we are living, &gt;&gt; we must be settled &gt;&gt; and know who we are. &gt;&gt; But we must know we are leaving a man of people who will perhaps try to emulate us. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It is the same devil &gt;&gt; in a religious in a religious form &gt;&gt; that persecuted Christ. &gt;&gt; It's the same devil that is in the church today wearing wrong wearing long ropes. They don't have to wear &gt;&gt; I don't mean the robe over their body. Oh, I mean the rope on your soul. Why the days why the days of miracles is passed? There is no such a thing. You talk about modern Pharisees. That is exactly they will have a form of godliness but we deny the power from such turn away. Get away from it. Just stay. Just stay. Keep yourself away. That's still them sons of God. Sorry. It is still them sons of God. But they are in a fallen condition. See what I mean? Some of them are ministers. Some of them are deacons. Some of them are elders. Some of them are bishops. Just as pur as they can be, they are here in Jefferson. If I can say they here in don't fight with me. That's why he says you must be sure the church you are going to who is teaching you. Amen. I want to check something here if I can find it. Yeah. Because &gt;&gt; you'll find you are taught by the fallen angel. There is he says here there is something about where you go, what church you go to, what teacher teaches you, do you know that it is it's got something to it. Therefore, we ought to seek out THE VERY BEST. THAT WE CAN FIND. So we are getting the best not because it is soable so forth but the the real Bible teaching that is that is what we are getting here. We are getting the best. Amen. a real Bible teaching. &gt;&gt; If someone can say this is not the seals, &gt;&gt; he he he he doesn't know what seals are. &gt;&gt; Let me just read something here. Amen. &gt;&gt; Someone may say, "Hi, it's long time. We are we are listening here. We want to hear seals. We don't hear seals here. We hear people talking." But but he doesn't know what seals are. Because the the the prophet &gt;&gt; is the one who taught us about these two seats. &gt;&gt; And then he's the one who told us what these seats are. And he was warning us about these seats. Then we must warn one one another about these seeds. We must not be influenced by them. We must be away from them. This book it it is the rising of the sun. It's the rising of the sun. He said page I think 307 paragraph 307 paragraph 307 &gt;&gt; I just read it in the med because I want to be fast and in that day in that they didn't know what it was and we knew we knew just look this way is our Lord up there he was talking about that cloud. He said it is our Lord Abdul. He is the one who opened those seals. He was talking about that cloud. That is the one that opened that cloud. He said those seven supernatural angels brought they brought that book. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let me go on here. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said he is the one who opened those seals. &gt;&gt; He is those seals for the whole word of God is Christ. Amen. He is the one who open those seals. He is those seals. What is the opening of the seal? He said, he said Christ is the seals that was opened. And what is the opening of the seals then? Is revealing Christ. Amen. All right, we shall come back there. &gt;&gt; We just pass there. We are not these bodies. &gt;&gt; But we are living in these bodies. These bodies, this flesh comes from the same place. the other seat and the the wrong seat and the true seats. They are in these bodies and they they are the same in these bodies and these bodies come from the same place dust and it goes back to dust. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the real us is the seat inside &gt;&gt; is not the body. &gt;&gt; Let me check the book of rapture if I can find it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It says here when it talks about the real us. It says here, &gt;&gt; look in this page state paragraph. It says here, look here, you are a tune being inside of this little fellow. Here is a soul. The next is a spirit. The next is a body. Now you got five senses in this building to conduct the earthly home. They don't conduct the rest of it. You got five senses of the spirit. Love and conscious so forth. But in here is where you live. That is what you are in the soul in the third. That is what you are. That is where you live in there. Is you is either is you and Satan or is you and God. That is you there. It depends who is with you there. It depends &gt;&gt; who is with you there. &gt;&gt; But you are in there. &gt;&gt; Let me read this one. &gt;&gt; This one page 30 works his faith expressed. Let me run fast. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It says here &gt;&gt; paragraph 206. Let me run. Paragraph 206 it speaks about the same thing but it is it is what it is in the court that is where you can intellectually can accept it for sure that looks good I believe that still don't do it and the spirit can actually make witness of it. I I I've I've me something there. Okay, &gt;&gt; let me start from 25. Now the outside body has five inlets and conduct your home. We have talked about and the inside which is the spirit five senses. But the inside of that the soul &gt;&gt; has only one thing that is where you live. He says because if that soul hasn't come from God, it can make all impersonations out here, but it cannot be real. You can act healing. You can act like you have it. You can act like you receive it. A Christian can act like they are Christians and act and act and be and act and be ever so good at it. But that don't mean they are safe. That is exactly right. See the spirit can be there. The real spirit, genuine spirit, the Holy Spirit can anoint you. But that still don't mean you are saved. It's that inside that never dies. It is what eternal. It always was eternal. It come from God. It goes to God. is the soul. That is the reason I say people can jump up and down, SPEAK IN TONGUES, people can shout, lay hands on the sick and heal the sick, so forth, by faith, all these great things there by the spirit, but still be lost. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; We we come through the same field. We came through that which is a woman. Amen. A woman has got a field and we came through that field and because of that field being two seats we came through this but we were defiled by that field and when we came through that field we came being controlled from the fifth dimension. Because the Bible says we were born sinners. The Bible says we were we were born in sin in iniquity coming to the earth speaking li. That's why you can see a small child. You you have not taught him to be angry. You you you'll find that the mother said he's angry is biting his mother's priest. Why? Because he's born a sinner. He he born through that channel. This channel defiled us. But we were not sinners before. Amen. But because we we we came through the channel, then we find ourselves controlled from the fifth dimension by Satan speaking lies stealing, hating other people because of that filth. Are you together with me? Let me just read another book here so that you can hear that is the prophet &gt;&gt; who says that one. &gt;&gt; It's not me. &gt;&gt; Don't say I'm talking about somebody you will be talking a lie. I'm talking about the two seats. I don't know you are the seed of Satan. You are the seed of God. I don't say that if you if you prepare if you if if you want to call yourself the seat of Satan. It's up to you. Don't say tell people this. I'm tell you about the two seeds. They are here. Amen. &gt;&gt; Whether we like it or not, even if you can close our eyes, even if we can sleep, but those things are easy. Amen. He says um the first life of your first in the book of the union of the bride and the bridegroom page 30 &gt;&gt; he says the first life of your first union. Let me start life. Life is a second thing to God. It is it is recorded in a book and God is the author of life. Do you believe that our natural life here we have here is just a perfection because of birth. Amen. Our life here is just a per it is it really should be the right life to begin with but is it is pered by natural birth that is what I'm telling you our birth has defiled us you come this been clean. When you come through this channel, you become dirty. You start to be a liar. that you be a thief because because of the channel you came through controlled by the fifth from the fifth dimension. That's why read John 5:4. Let's hear that 524. Before you read that, let me read another here. How did you come to do this? You were deceived into it by your first marriage. You are transparency. It is not your fault. It is not your fault of It is not fault of your own. By your natural birth, you come after Eve who committed a you were deceived into it. It is not your fault, you never did it because that little gem that was in you was to be in you before the foundation of the world. It is not your fault. It's because of the birth you came through. You were defiled by that. Amen. &gt;&gt; You are not a sinner to start with. Amen. Because since started in heaven when Satan preached and they believed him, they disbelieved Michael because sin is unbelief. When they disbelieve Michael, they became sinners. Let me read this one. book can read is the original. I'm going to read that one. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It says, &gt;&gt; well, that is the same thing from predestination. You are supposed to be here in the right way at the beginning because you are the seat soon by God. You you you should you should be you should have been here in the right way being that you come the way you did you were subject to the fall being that you are predestinated you hear the weight it brings you right back where you were pestinated What makes you believe the word of God? Turn down these other things and turn down this other thing because there is something in you way back beyond that. You are made to live here forever. All that he FORNEEW all that he has called has justified all that he has justified he has already glorified the only thing I am doing. All right. Amen. &gt;&gt; What is the use of preaching brother? &gt;&gt; Why would you preach? The prophet answered &gt;&gt; all that he said there is there is a crop out there and he said now there is a crop out there only thing I am doing is sinning is saying that is what I'm doing here. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because there is a there is a crop out there. I'm just throwing it out there where it goes. If they are repellent, the the grease of mark of the world &gt;&gt; and the denomination, &gt;&gt; it can't help it. But if there is one out there that can absorb, he will tend to be a son and affect. Amen. Read brother John 5:4 Verily, verily, I say unto you, he that heareth my word and believe on him that sent me hath everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation, but is passed from death unto life. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We were born in there. That's what the Bible says. Those who hear my word, where do we hear the weight from? We feel we hear the word because we are born in there. He said the Bible says we will move from there because we have got eternal life. Those who hear are those who have heard. But we are all there in that conglomeration. Then because we are born there, the word OF GOD COME THERE. When the word of God is spoken because it is spoken, we are in death. Then we hear the word. We are all there. THE TWO SEATS. WE are all when the word of God comes. When the word comes, it separates. Amen. &gt;&gt; He that had an ear, let him hear. Amen. &gt;&gt; But &gt;&gt; Matthew chapter 13, &gt;&gt; verse 13, &gt;&gt; verse 13, &gt;&gt; we hear the word together, &gt;&gt; but the other group The weight cannot help them. &gt;&gt; But we hear it together. &gt;&gt; That's what the word didn't help Kane. They said if you can do like your brother when the word speaks is the more he got angry. If there's someone here who the word when the word speaks the more he got angry that is up to him. But the person we have seen doing like that it was &gt;&gt; all right. You can read the Bible. &gt;&gt; Matthews 13:13. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Therefore speak I to them in parables because they see not and hearing they hear not neither do they understand. &gt;&gt; Yes. Up to 60. And in them is fulfilled the prophecy of Isaiah's which said, "By hearing you shall hear and shall not understand, and seeing you shall see and shall not perceive. For this people's heart is works cross and their ears are dull of hearing and their eyes they have closed. Lest at any time they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears &gt;&gt; and should understand with their heart and should be converted and I should heal them. &gt;&gt; In other words, in other words, their ears are blocked. feel. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because if they can hear, God will save them. &gt;&gt; But even if they the word is speech, if you can jump and throw your head on the floor, they will just see this mad man because they are ears. are dull to hear. If they can be if they can hear they will be safe. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He said here. &gt;&gt; Blessed are your eyes for they see and your ears for they hear. Amen. You are all there but some ears they hear some ears &gt;&gt; they don't hear other group when they hear the weight they come out &gt;&gt; because Jesus came to save them. He knew that you will born in that way. Then he said, "I will come and save my child because he's born in that way." &gt;&gt; Are you together with me? Jesus came to save his. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Satan doesn't know his. is not sure. &gt;&gt; What is sure about is those who are called Satan worshippers. &gt;&gt; Satan worshippers. &gt;&gt; But Satan is of those Satan is sure of those. But those who are in the churches, &gt;&gt; he's not sure whether they are his or not. Because when he saw you say, "Amen." Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, no. This one is &gt;&gt; But only God sees the heart. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let me read here in this book. No, I did not. Now, the only way up here in this spheres that you could ever that that you you could ever be in this little inside man. Let me jump others here. I was in Christ. You were in Christ the foundation of the world. He came to redeem his own, his own that was in him. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. His children that was in. He never came to save the devil's children. They will never know it. And they will never understand. They will never listen. You see the Pharisees, &gt;&gt; they were saying, you hear this boy, we know his mother and his father. That is the type of the spirit of Pharisees. If you preach, they speak something. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because when Jesus was there, &gt;&gt; they say we know this boy. &gt;&gt; When people say, "Amen. We know how he was born. &gt;&gt; Let me read here. &gt;&gt; God vindicates that. &gt;&gt; God vindicates that that is always been right. What is this to be true? Show plainly the predestinated is the only one who are considered in redemption. The predestinated is the only ONE that is considered in redemption. People might be making like they think they are But the real redemption is those that are predestinated because the very word redeem means bring back. Is that right? Amen. The redeem is something to redeem anything is bring it back to its original. Hallelujah. Amen. So it's only the predestination that will be brought back others didn't come from there. Amen. The only the predestination will be brought back. These things which are happening here on earth are influenced by the battle in heaven. What we are now here depends on which side you were in heaven. Nothing will change. We will take the part we took there. Here on earth we find these people. One influence from below, one influence from above. One is a believer here because he believed God there. Another one is unbeliever here. Because he didn't believe God there. These people here, these two seas here, they come from different PLACES up or down. Amen. &gt;&gt; They come from different places and have relationship WITH or influence from from those places. Even now we are here influenced differently. We are influenced from where we are. We are influenced from where we are. I don't know whether they will flesh my picture if they can. But if let me read here It says here in this book &gt;&gt; you see you we we are living or I shall read here we hear that one. &gt;&gt; Amen. Here I have often said I believe in the church here and each one is in this great conglomeration. This here there is a role here. In here lives mortal beings and each one in this great conglomeration of blackness and darkness. Mortals live here. They are either influenced from this way or from that way. In other either influence from above or from below but they living here on earth. We are living here on earth. Is influence from heaven or from under? You are influenced from somewhere. Whether you want to tell me or you don't want to tell me but you are influenced from somewhere I am telling you you cannot you cannot be here a spirit being sinner or saint without having any influence from underworld or from above wealth. If you are influenced from above, wealth, it means you are from there. It means you are there. Amen. If you It means your celestial body is there. He's waiting up there. Can you read a a a scripture, my brother? Matthew chapter 10 verse 8. I'm going to leave others. &gt;&gt; Matthew 18:10. &gt;&gt; Matthew 18 verse 10. &gt;&gt; What does he say there? &gt;&gt; Take heed that ye despise not one of these little ones. For I say unto you that in heaven their angels do always behold the face of the father which is in heaven. They are angels. They are bodies. They are there. You are represented there. If you are the child of God, you are represented there. That is what it is saying here. If you are influenced from there, your celestial body, your angel is waiting for you there because your angel there is your body. Amen. But if you are influenced from below, but if you are wicked and hypo hypocritical, you are celeial body. is down there. In other words, you are living here but controlled from be. If you are the child of God, you are living here but you are controlled from above. You get influence from above. You are not getting influence FROM BELOW. THE LAW cannot influence you influence. Amen. The fruits you bear here, it proves where you come from. So you are here, what you are somewhere, your life that you live here, it's just a reflection.
