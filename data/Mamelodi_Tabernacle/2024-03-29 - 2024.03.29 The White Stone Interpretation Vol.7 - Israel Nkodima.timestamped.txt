[1:31:20] say
[1:31:22] prayer
[1:31:24] let us
[1:31:26] pray gracious
[1:31:29] Lord once again
[1:31:32] father it is through your mercy that we
[1:31:35] could bow our
[1:31:37] heads with Holiness in our
[1:31:40] heart Holiness of the full weight that
[1:31:43] has been
[1:31:44] revealed and Lord Almighty in the time
[1:31:47] that we are living in we just sang a
[1:31:50] song that said I'll be ready yes Lord
[1:31:55] being
[1:31:57] Overcomers we we are already ready
[1:32:00] Lord knowing that you came to the
[1:32:04] Jews Lord
[1:32:06] Almighty to manifest the
[1:32:08] word and Lord Almighty you are you are
[1:32:11] in us now the
[1:32:13] Gentiles to manifest that word now the
[1:32:17] manifested word Lord is within us Lord
[1:32:21] and as we are about to read that word
[1:32:24] there's our pastor Lord behind the P pit
[1:32:28] gracious Heavenly Father we know that
[1:32:30] you have anointed him and we know Lord
[1:32:34] Almighty that you have Sanctified him to

[1:33:05] even our Prophet said we should pray for
[1:33:08] them Lord father we pray for our pastor

[1:33:13] vessel that is going to teach the W
[1:33:16] today Lord May our hearts Lord Almighty

[1:33:30] Lord for your word Lord Believers coming

[1:34:08] we are here as Believers without any
[1:34:11] devil we don't need any demon here Lord
[1:34:15] Almighty but we know that that has
[1:34:17] already been taking place Lord your word
[1:34:20] has been taking place Lord thank you
[1:34:22] Father take control Lord of everything

[1:46:27] Le there's a pastor
[1:46:30] there amen amen so they have arranged
[1:46:34] for
[1:46:36] us okay
[1:46:39] anyhow it's not time for
[1:46:42] the to report about this things
[1:46:46] now we all know about them we we'll be
[1:46:49] going
[1:46:51] there all right amen
[1:46:54] um last we ask a
[1:47:00] question about
[1:47:03] the Battle of
[1:47:10] amagon I wonder this who are asking
[1:47:15] talking about under
[1:47:21] under
[1:47:26] don't they know what is the
[1:47:29] underworld they don't know
[1:47:32] okay do they know about the coming of
[1:47:36] the battle
[1:47:41] of
[1:47:46] no all right amen but
[1:47:50] today I will read for few few minutes
[1:47:55] here about
[1:47:59] the just to finish up
[1:48:04] some part of
[1:48:07] [Music]
[1:48:11] this amen
[1:48:14] amen and that one it is very impossible
[1:48:17] to
[1:48:21] impersonate
[1:48:23] because impersonation
[1:48:26] is everywhere
[1:48:32] now the reason being
[1:48:36] that uh John
[1:48:41] Wason to come
[1:48:43] up and the
[1:48:46] prophet told
[1:48:48] us that was after the seven Church ages
[1:48:55] I mean he he has seen the seven
[1:49:00] chur amen because you can only be
[1:49:05] suon
[1:49:08] up after you have
[1:49:11] seen because seven churches speak of
[1:49:16] time amen amen now he was someon to come
[1:49:21] up
[1:49:24] after he has seen the
[1:49:28] time he seen that time of the church
[1:49:33] ages because uh if you uh we are going
[1:49:39] back you are going back to the church
[1:49:44] ages you are only going to continue with
[1:49:48] a
[1:49:50] [Music]
[1:49:51] reputation
[1:49:54] but as the prophet
[1:49:56] said the seventh
[1:49:59] seal is the end of the time of all
[1:50:05] things amen amen amen and there's some
[1:50:10] people that are still waiting for the
[1:50:13] revelation of the seventh
[1:50:18] season but we'll come with that show
[1:50:23] that seven seal was
[1:50:29] revealed
[1:50:31] but if you are still residing
[1:50:35] in
[1:50:39] churches time of the
[1:50:42] churches amen amen you are not in line
[1:50:46] with the revelation of
[1:50:51] God because according to the word of
[1:50:54] God the seven seal which we will come
[1:50:59] will read some
[1:51:00] things and to show that the seven
[1:51:05] seal is was
[1:51:09] revealed
[1:51:11] amen let's wait for
[1:51:14] that we are we are talking about it
[1:51:16] every
[1:51:18] day but only you cannot impersonate
[1:51:26] amen that's why the prophet
[1:51:30] said
[1:51:35] John the message came to
[1:51:38] John and said come
[1:51:43] up and I will show
[1:51:45] you
[1:51:47] to to
[1:51:51] come now if you are told
[1:51:55] that you hear that
[1:51:57] word I will show you
[1:52:00] things to
[1:52:03] come
[1:52:06] meaning the
[1:52:09] past will remain the
[1:52:13] past meaning there there's
[1:52:17] another he says I'll show
[1:52:21] you that
[1:52:23] things that say
[1:52:27] it all right here

[1:53:03] bride Revelation 21 yes verse
[1:53:08] 9 and there came unto me one of the
[1:53:11] Seven Angels which had the seven vials

[1:54:12] bride who is the bride of
[1:54:16] Christ I'm not talking about the message
[1:54:20] Church talking about the

[1:54:31] has the
[1:54:34] weight as my Prophet

[2:06:39] am for a certain
[2:06:42] time for a certain

[2:07:25] not real
[2:07:28] body we will come to
[2:07:31] that to look at this
[2:07:35] bodies the prophet taugh me

[2:08:01] wants to come so that I can pray for
[2:08:06] her
[2:08:08] and she's talking about the people that
[2:08:11] are
[2:08:14] against but she
[2:08:17] says but
[2:08:19] you you have two
[2:08:25] bodies I

[2:18:36] amen didn't the Bible
[2:18:40] say uh we I'm still coming to the White
[2:18:46] Stone the B
[2:18:49] says he who hates his
[2:18:55] brother let me
[2:18:58] repeat he who hates his
[2:19:02] brother he who hates his sister
[2:19:11] [Music]
[2:19:14] sister what's the
[2:19:17] answer he is
[2:19:19] like
[2:19:24] he he's talking about a
[2:19:26] person like if he says
[2:19:30] K the first man to
[2:19:34] kill
[2:19:38] was now if it says he who hates his
[2:19:49] brother he doesn't say he hates because
[2:19:54] [Music]
[2:19:55] of no he says he is
[2:20:01] like the original
[2:20:08] killer is that right
[2:20:11] amen okay amen now let
[2:20:15] us continue for few
[2:20:19] minutes
[2:20:22] that's why I was reading even
[2:20:28] recently the day of
[2:20:34] redemption okay
[2:20:37] amen and the people are preaching
[2:20:41] it the day of redemption of
[2:20:45] redemption amen amen
[2:20:48] but which day is this
[2:20:53] we don't do you have a
[2:20:56] calendar that tells you that the day of
[2:21:00] redemption is on such and such a
[2:21:06] day amen
[2:21:09] amen and where the people will start
[2:21:12] running to and
[2:21:15] through uh trying to make things
[2:21:18] right you will never
[2:21:22] that's why the Lord Jesus knowing that
[2:21:25] we couldn't redeem
[2:21:28] ourselves he came himself without
[2:21:34] sin to shed his
[2:21:37] blood and he knew that the only
[2:21:42] gospel will come
[2:21:46] through
[2:21:49] blood
[2:21:51] because the blood of
[2:21:53] Jesus that's why he's a
[2:21:58] Kingsman and it says we were
[2:22:02] Redeemed
[2:22:04] by
[2:22:07] whom all
[2:22:08] [Music]
[2:22:12] right I said
[2:22:14] Dad people were
[2:22:19] wondering
[2:22:23] why now it seems like Pastor is making
[2:22:25] Jesus our friend
[2:22:28] now because it
[2:22:31] says
[2:22:34] brother because they say what a friend I
[2:22:37] have am in
[2:22:45] Jesus people can hate you the whole
[2:22:49] world
[2:22:51] but as long as you have
[2:22:56] Jesus amen
[2:22:59] amen it won't bother
[2:23:03] you if you have Jesus as your
[2:23:08] friend then you own
[2:23:13] all you have
[2:23:16] all because in Jesus we have found all
[2:23:22] that's why they say Give Me
[2:23:24] Jesus and that's enough for
[2:23:27] me I need I don't need Jesus
[2:23:34] end he is everything he's
[2:23:39] everything he's everything to
[2:23:41] me
[2:23:45] he he everything to me he my father
[2:23:51] my sister my father and my mother
[2:23:57] he everything to me amen
[2:24:03] [Applause]
[2:24:05] amen
[2:24:08] naturally I can't show you somebody and
[2:24:11] say this is my blood
[2:24:18] brother do you know
[2:24:21] my
[2:24:22] family I mean in this
[2:24:26] way have you seen my
[2:24:32] father my
[2:24:35] mother or you've just seen her but where
[2:24:39] is where is
[2:24:41] [Music]
[2:24:43] she do you know she's not with
[2:24:47] me if I say my
[2:24:50] [Music]
[2:24:52] I have my mother passed
[2:24:56] on is that right
[2:24:59] amen
[2:25:02] now but I have something
[2:25:09] Eternal that cannot pass
[2:25:13] away and God made it he made it this way
[2:25:21] if talking about the Kingman
[2:25:29] Redeemer this Gospel of the
[2:25:33] seals it makes you one with
[2:25:40] God the whole world can leave
[2:25:44] you amen but the king
[2:25:47] man cannot leave you
[2:25:52] that's why he came shed his blood and he
[2:25:56] it is
[2:25:57] impossible for God to leave
[2:26:01] [Applause]
[2:26:03] you amen amen amen because you are Of
[2:26:07] The
[2:26:12] Bloodline the person of the blood
[2:26:19] line is not forced to do
[2:26:25] anything that's why the the prophet of
[2:26:28] God
[2:26:29] says your pro your
[2:26:33] theop you have
[2:26:37] heard
[2:26:43] before you have
[2:26:45] heard it doesn't say you are going to
[2:26:49] hear
[2:26:51] no that means what is preached to
[2:26:56] you you have already
[2:27:00] had
[2:27:02] amen amen am that's
[2:27:05] why if the way comes to
[2:27:08] you is just
[2:27:12] amen that's
[2:27:15] and you you you are not
[2:27:18] struggling to do the will of God
[2:27:21] no because
[2:27:23] your is the will of
[2:27:28] God
[2:27:32] amen
[2:27:33] amen you know I we read the
[2:27:39] books
[2:27:42] especially uh those who know
[2:27:44] me they know even I I sometimes I don't
[2:27:52] sleep or I sleep early in the
[2:27:57] morning even even
[2:28:01] today early in the
[2:28:04] morning all right why because a real
[2:28:10] Christian reads his
[2:28:13] [Music]
[2:28:16] Bible he
[2:28:18] read spoken
[2:28:21] spoken
[2:28:23] spoken when you
[2:28:26] come preach by
[2:28:31] Revelation
[2:28:33] he but can you hear what he says because
[2:28:37] he
[2:28:38] says you have
[2:28:42] heard that's why you
[2:28:47] hear amen
[2:28:50] you remember that part we have
[2:28:56] read he speaks about the fourth
[2:29:00] dimension you know
[2:29:04] radios
[2:29:07] all amen
[2:29:09] amen of which the children of
[2:29:16] today they are not going
[2:29:19] anywhere
[2:29:20] unless by
[2:29:23] predestination because of these things
[2:29:25] that are
[2:29:29] happening you won't even
[2:29:31] find a
[2:29:35] child
[2:29:37] because the moment they start
[2:29:41] to
[2:29:44] hear they hear these things of the
[2:29:47] world Amen amen amen amen now that's why
[2:29:53] the true
[2:29:55] Christianity is something you have
[2:30:01] heard
[2:30:03] amen amen that's why he says you have
[2:30:07] heard from
[2:30:10] your now if somebody comes with
[2:30:14] something different you don't hear him
[2:30:17] or her because you have heard from your
[2:30:24] now I will tell you that I'll keep this
[2:30:27] one I have heard from my
[2:30:30] theop because theop is light and
[2:30:38] the that's God in
[2:30:43] plural
[2:30:46] amen that's why he says this body the
[2:30:51] is
[2:30:53] subject to the
[2:30:55] word of God
[2:30:59] Amen all right amen there's something in
[2:31:02] you pulling
[2:31:05] you every time you want to read the
[2:31:09] Bible the spoken
[2:31:13] way inside there is something pulling
[2:31:15] you something is pulling
[2:31:18] you amen
[2:31:22] waiting for the Rapture is not like
[2:31:24] waiting at the bus
[2:31:30] stop you
[2:31:32] have
[2:31:35] Peter why you are still remaining While
[2:31:38] others have
[2:31:42] left Lord where shall we
[2:31:48] go you know your chrisan
[2:31:51] should arrive at that
[2:31:54] place without this word where shall I
[2:32:00] go because that is his or her
[2:32:04] place she has from
[2:32:10] the the Samaritan woman do you know that
[2:32:15] when Messiah
[2:32:17] come he will tell us
[2:32:21] she has H from
[2:32:23] [Music]
[2:32:27] her Peter also
[2:32:30] said Lord where shall we
[2:32:34] go because it is in
[2:32:40] theop if it is in your
[2:32:45] theop you are just like
[2:32:48] Peter
[2:32:50] there's no other place for
[2:32:55] you even if you can go all of
[2:33:00] you but the person who has hit from
[2:33:05] the will
[2:33:10] remain Lord where shall we

[2:33:28] man that's
[2:33:31] why I I have this here hold that
[2:33:36] word
