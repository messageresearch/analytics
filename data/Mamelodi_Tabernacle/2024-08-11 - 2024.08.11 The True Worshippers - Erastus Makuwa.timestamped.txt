[1:15:25] the the student is not higher than the
[1:15:32] teacher you don't judge the the student
[1:15:36] by the
[1:15:40] teacher he may make
[1:15:43] mistakes but not the
[1:15:47] teacher um
[1:15:50] here I'm going to make a spiritual
[1:15:54] lecture
[1:15:59] um The Heading will be the true
[1:16:08] worshipers and we must know who are
[1:16:14] those because when we bring something
[1:16:18] here is a
[1:16:22] mirror you look inside the mirror
[1:16:26] you see whether you can find yourself
[1:16:31] there if you don't see
[1:16:35] yourself is either you are
[1:16:40] Beed your image cannot be cannot be seen
[1:16:45] cannot be Pro
[1:16:49] projected because theyed you
[1:16:54] you must
[1:16:57] worry why why can't I see
[1:17:02] myself then this is the scriptures are
[1:17:06] the
[1:17:09] mirror always I want to go to what I
[1:17:13] have placed in front of
[1:17:20] you I want you or I want to
[1:17:25] produce or project to
[1:17:31] you the true
[1:17:35] [Music]
[1:17:38] worshippers and then
[1:17:41] uh you must know
[1:17:48] them we afraid
[1:17:51] here the Bible says
[1:17:56] when the hour
[1:18:00] cometh and now
[1:18:04] is it was Jesus talking to his
[1:18:09] disciples he talks about the hour
[1:18:13] coming he said now
[1:18:17] is in other words that that hour is
[1:18:20] still
[1:18:22] coming but the hour which is
[1:18:26] it's just the same with this
[1:18:30] one in other words we have got true
[1:18:33] worshipers
[1:18:37] here but the true worshipers are still
[1:18:42] coming and they will worship the
[1:18:47] father in other the worshipers
[1:18:52] here they are worshiping the
[1:18:56] and then the the worshipers
[1:19:00] coming they will also worship the
[1:19:04] father and when they worship the
[1:19:07] father they will worship Him in
[1:19:12] spirit and the
[1:19:15] truth and we must know what is the
[1:19:17] spirit and what is the
[1:19:21] TR because if you don't know that
[1:19:26] how can you worship
[1:19:30] him we have
[1:19:33] read he said God was asking
[1:19:38] job where were you

[1:20:00] there before the foundation of the
[1:20:04] world it started
[1:20:06] there and it came here it does not start

[1:21:29] Lucifer he's on Earth
[1:21:32] today but let me read something
[1:21:35] here Satan was the original Archangel of
[1:21:41] [Music]
[1:21:44] God he once dwelt in
[1:21:48] [Music]
[1:21:50] heaven he once was the greatest person
[1:21:54] in heaven
[1:21:55] of
[1:21:59] God are you
[1:22:02] listening you cannot know the person if
[1:22:05] you know his
[1:22:09] origin if you you say you know
[1:22:12] him you must know his
[1:22:18] or he once was the greatest person in
[1:22:22] heaven
[1:22:26] outside of
[1:22:27] God he was God's right hand
[1:22:32] man to
[1:22:35] Fellowship he got
[1:22:39] p in up in his
[1:22:45] heart he was coequal with God one day
[1:22:55] Lucifer
[1:22:57] Lucifer are you together with
[1:23:00] me let me read this some
[1:23:04] here he was that is Lucifer I'm I'm
[1:23:08] reading
[1:23:10] about did you know Satan was coequal
[1:23:13] with God one
[1:23:18] day he was
[1:23:22] sure he show
[1:23:27] was all but a
[1:23:30] [Music]
[1:23:32] Creator he was equal with God but he was
[1:23:35] not the
[1:23:36] [Applause]
[1:23:38] [Music]
[1:23:39] Creator he was
[1:23:42] everything stood at the right hand of
[1:23:44] God in
[1:23:47] heaven a great leading
[1:23:53] Chim notice the reason that she did all
[1:23:56] right she was a great leading
[1:24:01] [Music]
[1:24:03] cherub he was most beautiful of all
[1:24:07] these angels in
[1:24:09] [Music]
[1:24:12] heaven that's why when he designed his
[1:24:18] design he designed something
[1:24:22] beautiful because woman is a design is
[1:24:26] his
[1:24:31] design Hey listen
[1:24:36] carefully you see
[1:24:39] flesh is
[1:24:41] sin this
[1:24:44] flesh it cannot it it cannot inherit the
[1:24:49] [Applause]
[1:24:51] kingdom is a pest house
[1:24:56] it doesn't matter whether it is
[1:24:59] the the Flesh of man or of a
[1:25:05] woman but a is a past
[1:25:10] house but there there is
[1:25:17] someone a
[1:25:20] woman the flesh the body this signed by
[1:25:27] Satan not the
[1:25:32] woman because the
[1:25:37] woman in the beginning he was Co equal
[1:25:41] with
[1:25:44] men in the beginning they are from one
[1:25:48] place woman and
[1:25:52] man but when it comes to
[1:25:57] the
[1:25:59] formation is from
[1:26:03] Satan are you together with I don't say
[1:26:07] women are from
[1:26:11] Satan they are from
[1:26:13] God but the
[1:26:16] formation even this
[1:26:18] formation is an animal formation
[1:26:25] even man's
[1:26:28] formation but it is like an
[1:26:33] animal but
[1:26:37] inside is something
[1:26:39] there there why when Satan
[1:26:43] comes with his design he makes something
[1:26:48] beautiful even sin is
[1:26:52] beautiful he was a beautiful
[1:27:00] creature let me show you something in
[1:27:04] scripture I going to take you back to
[1:27:08] scripture and throw your opinion as you
[1:27:11] look at it
[1:27:13] [Music]
[1:27:15] today Satan is the one who fetes in that
[1:27:19] kind of beauty
[1:27:25] if we
[1:27:26] notice he was the most beautiful of all
[1:27:30] these angels in
[1:27:35] heaven is that right he decided to make
[1:27:40] Heaven a more beautiful
[1:27:47] place than the kingdom of Mich
[1:27:55] is that right also to show that Kan was
[1:27:59] his

[1:28:01] son he offered a more beautiful
[1:28:11] worship decorated his altars with fruits
[1:28:15] and flowers and so
[1:28:20] forth fruits is that right
[1:28:25] beautiful sin is
[1:28:28] beautiful what we call
