[49:11] and trials
[49:14] to bear.

[49:23] of Jesus
[49:26] and heaven
[49:29] in view.
[49:31] Our burdens
[49:34] &gt;&gt; are much lighter
[49:37] to bear.

[51:25] the place
[51:28] when Jesus
[51:31] so swiftly
[51:33] came in.
[51:39] How he lifted
[51:42] the burden
[51:45] I had carried
[51:47] for so long.
[51:50] And he gave me
[51:53] a vision of him.

[1:07:21] as he
[1:07:23] has declared
[1:07:26] to his

[1:07:37] the Elijah
[1:07:39] the prophet
[1:07:42] before

[1:07:52] And he
[1:07:54] shall tell
[1:07:57] the hearts
[1:07:59] of their fathers
[1:08:02] to their children.
[1:08:04] and the hearts
[1:08:07] of their children
[1:08:09] to their fatherless
[1:08:24] the earth
[1:08:30] where God
[1:08:38] Holy holy
[1:08:44] ghost
[1:08:49] with power
[1:08:52] with power.
[1:09:01] Holy Ghost,
[1:09:05] the Holy Ghost
[1:09:21] in the wonderful name of our Lord and
[1:09:22] Savior Jesus Christ.
[1:09:26] I'm not sure if I'm audible.
[1:09:37] Can you hear me?
[1:09:50] to check.
[1:09:52] So, welcome.
[1:10:07] Holy
[1:10:09] Ghost,
[1:10:12] we welcome
[1:10:27] Holy
[1:10:29] Ghost,
[1:10:31] we welcome
[1:10:35] thee.
[1:10:37] God
[1:10:39] with power
[1:10:42] this very
[1:10:50] holy
[1:10:52] ro
[1:10:54] we were.
[1:10:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:11:00] Hallelujah.
[1:11:05] &gt;&gt; Testing one two. Am I audible?
[1:11:08] &gt;&gt; All right. Amen.
[1:11:10] &gt;&gt; It looks like we're good to go.
[1:11:14] &gt;&gt; Let me first start by greeting you in
[1:11:17] the wonderful name of our Lord Jesus.
[1:11:23] It is yet once more another beautiful
[1:11:25] morning
[1:11:29] and we are glad to be in the house of
[1:11:32] the Lord.
[1:11:34] Uh because this is the house of
[1:11:36] correction
[1:11:39] and we are what we are because of this
[1:11:42] househ
[1:11:46] when correction comes
[1:11:49] we need to align ourselves
[1:11:54] you know I saw that the highest office
[1:11:56] that you find
[1:12:01] now that is the prophet
[1:12:03] &gt;&gt; in the church order
[1:12:06] he says is the office of the pastor.
[1:12:10] &gt;&gt; So it's the highest office with the
[1:12:11] highest correction.
[1:12:15] So um in other words
[1:12:18] um um if in this day and age
[1:12:24] that we are living in
[1:12:27] &gt;&gt; we want to be h straight with the Lord.
[1:12:34] You know we need to align ourselves
[1:12:38] with the offices that he ordained.
[1:12:43] And then if we do that
[1:12:45] and then I tell you the truth, we will
[1:12:48] grow from strength to strength
[1:12:51] from power to power.
[1:12:54] Um we will be transformed.
[1:12:58] The power of transformation
[1:13:00] will start to work in us.
[1:13:03] Um
[1:13:05] that was just my greeting.
[1:13:08] So maybe for this morning
[1:13:13] if we got our Bibles
[1:13:16] we can go to
[1:13:18] the book of Genesis
[1:13:22] we read again verse 1 to verse 5
[1:13:30] Genesis 1 verse 1-5
[1:13:33] in the beginning God created the heaven
[1:13:35] and the earth And the earth was without
[1:13:39] form and void, and darkness was upon the
[1:13:42] face of the deep. And the spirit of God
[1:13:45] moved upon the face of the waters. And
[1:13:48] God said, "Let there be light." And
[1:13:51] there was light. And God saw the light
[1:13:54] that it was good. And God divided the
[1:13:57] light from the darkness. And God called
[1:13:59] the light day, and the darkness he
[1:14:02] called night. And the evening and the
[1:14:05] morning were the first day.
[1:14:07] Amen. Amen. Can you say a word of prayer
[1:14:09] for us?
[1:14:54] Amen.
[1:14:59] Yes.
[1:15:19] Amen. Amen. God bless you.
[1:15:28] So um my subject uh this morning
[1:15:35] is just to continue with the message
[1:15:38] that we had the last time I was here.
[1:15:45] You recall that we were talking about
[1:15:47] children of the light
[1:15:52] and that's I just want us to follow that
[1:15:55] trail
[1:15:59] and it's because you know I was trying
[1:16:01] to look elsewhere
[1:16:05] but something said to me you haven't
[1:16:07] finished
[1:16:10] &gt;&gt; and so um I thought maybe let me come
[1:16:14] back again
[1:16:17] because you know when you talk about
[1:16:19] light
[1:16:22] you're talking about something that
[1:16:25] has creative power like we said
[1:16:33] because that is the first thing that God
[1:16:36] created
[1:16:40] and um when you follow uh this light,
[1:16:46] &gt;&gt; the supernatural one. Now,
[1:16:50] you realize that
[1:16:53] it's the alpha and the omega.
[1:16:58] You'll realize that the whole Bible
[1:17:02] is centered around that
[1:17:07] without light
[1:17:10] nothing could happen.
[1:17:13] Now maybe quickly let us uh try and
[1:17:17] recap a little bit
[1:17:24] uh just to refresh our memory
[1:17:28] uh before we jump into the thought.
[1:17:32] Um and in doing that we read from verse
[1:17:37] one to verse 5
[1:17:41] but also let's read verse I think it's
[1:17:43] 14
[1:17:48] verse 14 it says and God said let there
[1:17:52] be lights in the firmament of the heaven
[1:17:55] to divide the day from the night and let
[1:17:59] them be for signs and for seasons and
[1:18:02] for days and years.
[1:18:04] &gt;&gt; All right. Um so we've tried to show
[1:18:06] that there there's two lights that we
[1:18:09] have.
[1:18:12] Um is the supernatural light
[1:18:16] which we found in verse three
[1:18:20] because it says God said
[1:18:22] let there be light and there was light.
[1:18:26] But in 14
[1:18:29] talks again
[1:18:31] that God said let there be lights.
[1:18:36] So here it's it's plural
[1:18:40] but where we started it's right.
[1:18:44] So the one is supernatural
[1:18:47] one is natural.
[1:18:51] When you come to the supernatural,
[1:18:55] it's one thing.
[1:18:57] But when we come to the natural,
[1:18:59] we find that it's light.
[1:19:03] Now, um, putting back in perspective.
[1:19:08] Maybe we can just show quickly that
[1:19:11] diagram where we were showing the solar
[1:19:15] system
[1:19:19] because
[1:19:22] You recall that we read last time
[1:19:27] in the spoken word
[1:19:31] &gt;&gt; and that spoken word is the cruelty of
[1:19:33] sin.
[1:19:38] &gt;&gt; How God
[1:19:41] when he was creating
[1:19:45] &gt;&gt; um he he he spoke
[1:19:51] Like I'm starting here in 14.
[1:19:55] He says, "Let there be lights
[1:19:58] in the firm in the firmament of the
[1:20:00] heaven to divide the day from the night.
[1:20:07] Um
[1:20:09] so the prophet
[1:20:11] &gt;&gt; took us to a trip
[1:20:15] &gt;&gt; and in this trip
[1:20:17] he says to us
[1:20:19] &gt;&gt; God when he started
[1:20:25] to say let there be lights
[1:20:28] &gt;&gt; the greatest light that there was
[1:20:32] it was the sun
[1:20:34] and he says all these other ones
[1:20:39] All these other planets,
[1:20:44] they actually sprung from the sun.
[1:20:50] You know, he he the prophet alludes that
[1:20:56] this theory of the big bang
[1:21:01] is not far from the truth.
[1:21:03] So he says go God spoke
[1:21:07] And then a missile went out.
[1:21:09] &gt;&gt; And then
[1:21:11] &gt;&gt; he calls it the linker went out.
[1:21:13] &gt;&gt; Amen. So that missile that went out,
[1:21:17] it's part of
[1:21:19] the sun,
[1:21:22] but it came from the sun
[1:21:25] and then it went out
[1:21:28] &gt;&gt; and then when it reached a point
[1:21:29] somewhere
[1:21:32] you know the prophet says
[1:21:35] this thing happened millions of years
[1:21:40] he says when it reach somewhere
[1:21:42] it will stop.
[1:21:44] And then another missile went out
[1:21:47] and when it reached someone and then he
[1:21:50] said stop and that's how they stopped
[1:21:54] and they're all hanging in space.
[1:22:03] Now he he says to us
[1:22:06] God is so vast
[1:22:10] even today when they study this
[1:22:13] universe.
[1:22:15] So that which you are seeing now
[1:22:18] it is just the basic.
[1:22:22] There are other planets that they
[1:22:23] discovering
[1:22:26] that are not listed here
[1:22:29] just to show how vast God is.
[1:22:34] other stars that are coming up
[1:22:41] because men is discovering
[1:22:46] through science
[1:22:48] and through the tools that they have.
[1:22:52] They discover other planets.
[1:22:56] So if you follow them,
[1:23:00] I don't know where you will end
[1:23:03] because this thing it just continues,
[1:23:07] &gt;&gt; just explodes.
[1:23:12] Now
[1:23:13] &gt;&gt; I want us to pick up something here.
[1:23:18] If you look
[1:23:19] where the earth is placed,
[1:23:23] if you can just flash it again that
[1:23:27] you will notice if you count from the
[1:23:28] sun,
[1:23:30] you find Mercury,
[1:23:32] &gt;&gt; you find Venus, Venus
[1:23:34] &gt;&gt; and then you find Earth.
[1:23:37] So if you count the planets
[1:23:41] from the sun
[1:23:45] because now everything comes from the
[1:23:47] sun.
[1:23:49] &gt;&gt; So the first one that came
[1:23:53] which is Mercury,
[1:23:56] &gt;&gt; it's the first
[1:23:58] and then we've got Venus which is the
[1:23:59] second.
[1:24:01] Now Earth was placed on the third.
[1:24:06] because it had to be placed in a perfect
[1:24:11] spot.
[1:24:15] Three is a is a number of perfection.
[1:24:19] That is why God placed it there. Now
[1:24:22] when the scientists came
[1:24:25] they tried to look
[1:24:27] that because they they see in earth
[1:24:31] it is the only planet
[1:24:35] that has got life in it.
[1:24:39] It's got bot life. It's got human life.
[1:24:42] It's got water. It's got It is the only
[1:24:46] planet
[1:24:47] that's got the environment
[1:24:50] that support living.
[1:24:54] Now even today they're still trying to
[1:24:58] probe
[1:25:00] which other planet
[1:25:04] that we can explore
[1:25:06] and then maybe
[1:25:09] man can survive there.
[1:25:12] But even today they haven't found one.
[1:25:19] earth.
[1:25:21] God prepared it
[1:25:23] specially
[1:25:25] for us to continue
[1:25:29] with the battle that started in heaven.
[1:25:34] So we are here not to relax.
[1:25:39] If you can find yourself relaxed,
[1:25:41] you must know something is wrong.
[1:25:44] But if you find yourself on your toes,
[1:25:49] every minute, every hour, then you know
[1:25:54] I'm in the right place,
[1:25:59] someone
[1:26:02] is trying to prove
[1:26:04] like he did with Job
[1:26:08] that go and test that one
[1:26:11] and see what he will do.
[1:26:15] Amen.
[1:26:17] So that is why you find there's children
[1:26:19] of the light
[1:26:21] and there's children of darkness.
[1:26:24] Are we together?
[1:26:27] That's how these things move together.
[1:26:32] Now
[1:26:34] again
[1:26:36] you will see that
[1:26:40] there is something
[1:26:42] special
[1:26:46] that God
[1:26:49] made about earth
[1:26:55] and that special thing
[1:27:01] it is Because
[1:27:03] God is an object of worship.
[1:27:10] So before he was God,
[1:27:14] it means there was no one to worship
[1:27:16] him.
[1:27:19] But for him to be God,
[1:27:22] he had to create an environment
[1:27:26] where now he's going to be worshiped
[1:27:30] as the almighty God.
[1:27:33] And he knew that those that are going to
[1:27:36] worship me,
[1:27:39] I'm going to give them part of myself.
[1:27:44] So they are not going to worship me
[1:27:47] from their own triings.
[1:27:51] They're going to worship me from the
[1:27:54] light
[1:27:55] that I had imparted.
[1:27:59] Right?
[1:28:01] So remember
[1:28:04] each one of the planet.
[1:28:07] &gt;&gt; Okay, let me explain something just to
[1:28:09] recap quickly and then I get to my
[1:28:12] as part of my recap. Amen.
[1:28:14] &gt;&gt; Remember that
[1:28:16] &gt;&gt; we had said
[1:28:19] &gt;&gt; um the earth
[1:28:22] &gt;&gt; that we live in
[1:28:25] &gt;&gt; um it's doing two things
[1:28:30] and one
[1:28:33] &gt;&gt; it's called rotation
[1:28:37] and another one it's called revolution.
[1:28:44] So it revolves. Okay. Yeah, I I think
[1:28:46] there it is.
[1:28:48] &gt;&gt; So the first one is rotation.
[1:28:52] &gt;&gt; So rotation
[1:28:54] if I demonstrate it so that we are
[1:28:56] together.
[1:28:58] It means it does this
[1:29:04] where it is.
[1:29:06] It does that. That is rotation.
[1:29:10] That is the earth. And that we have read
[1:29:13] it in 14.
[1:29:15] &gt;&gt; Let me read again.
[1:29:17] And God said, let there be lights
[1:29:20] in the firmament of the heaven
[1:29:24] to divide the day from the night.
[1:29:27] So to divide the day from the night
[1:29:32] revolves
[1:29:35] rotate. Sorry. Rotate.
[1:29:38] &gt;&gt; Yeah. like this
[1:29:40] where it is it's rotating
[1:29:45] there's another movement.
[1:29:48] So the rotation
[1:29:51] takes 24 hours
[1:29:55] 12 day
[1:29:58] 12 night
[1:30:00] that's rotation.
[1:30:02] &gt;&gt; That is why in this earth
[1:30:06] when we are here it's morning but
[1:30:09] somewhere else it's night
[1:30:12] because it depends your position to the
[1:30:15] sun.
[1:30:21] Are we together?
[1:30:22] &gt;&gt; Then there's another one
[1:30:26] &gt;&gt; that move
[1:30:29] it is revolution.
[1:30:32] &gt;&gt; This is the one.
[1:30:34] So revolution
[1:30:36] takes about 365 years.
[1:30:40] 365 give or take
[1:30:43] that is according to science.
[1:30:46] But the prophet will come and says this
[1:30:50] calendar is wrong
[1:30:56] and we get to what 360 I think. 360 give
[1:31:00] or take. Amen.
[1:31:02] &gt;&gt; Who do you take?
[1:31:05] &gt;&gt; I take the prophet.
[1:31:08] Now the the revolution
[1:31:12] brings
[1:31:14] and this is verse 14.
[1:31:17] &gt;&gt; It says, "And let them be for signs
[1:31:21] &gt;&gt; and for the seasons
[1:31:23] &gt;&gt; and for the days
[1:31:25] &gt;&gt; and for years." Amen.
[1:31:27] &gt;&gt; So the revolution
[1:31:29] revolution
[1:31:31] it brings as I have right here
[1:31:34] &gt;&gt; the seasons. That is why we have winter
[1:31:40] here now.
[1:31:42] We are in summer.
[1:31:46] &gt;&gt; Right. But where is
[1:31:51] he told me it's winter?
[1:31:54] Are we together? Amen. Now h all these
[1:31:58] things
[1:32:00] depend
[1:32:03] how you are positioned
[1:32:05] to the s.
[1:32:09] So h we get seasons
[1:32:13] because
[1:32:15] it depends where are we positioned to
[1:32:18] the sun.
[1:32:20] And it also says he put signs.
[1:32:26] This thing that he did, it's for signs.
[1:32:32] That is why we've also mentioned that
[1:32:36] the first the first Bible
[1:32:39] was in the
[1:32:42] zodiac. Yeah. Because there you'll get
[1:32:45] the sign,
[1:32:46] you'll get the times.
[1:32:49] Today we are spoiled
[1:32:52] because we've got the claw. But if you
[1:32:54] can visit the olden people,
[1:32:57] they used to look for time.
[1:33:01] They used to look the sky
[1:33:03] whether it's day or night.
[1:33:08] Maybe me I can try during the day
[1:33:12] cuz I know where the sun sets. I mean it
[1:33:14] rises
[1:33:16] and I know when it's midday.
[1:33:19] And I know when it's setting
[1:33:21] but in the night I've got a challenge
[1:33:26] but the olden people they used to go out
[1:33:29] they will tell you about the north not
[1:33:30] star
[1:33:35] they will tell you a lot of things about
[1:33:37] the signs that are there.
[1:33:40] That is why the wise men from the east
[1:33:43] they saw a sign and they knew that a
[1:33:47] king is born. They knew that God cannot
[1:33:50] lie.
[1:33:52] That is the writing of God.
[1:33:55] If you see the sign there,
[1:33:58] that sign is perfect.
[1:34:00] What's happening there? It's happening
[1:34:03] here.
[1:34:05] Amen.
[1:34:07] &gt;&gt; He made the bigger lights to to rule in
[1:34:10] the day
[1:34:13] and the lesser light
[1:34:16] to to to rule during the night.
[1:34:20] You know distinct type,
[1:34:24] there's a lesser, there's a greater
[1:34:26] life. Both have ruling power.
[1:34:34] If you look
[1:34:37] around
[1:34:39] during the day,
[1:34:42] okay, there are works of the night,
[1:34:46] there are works of the day.
[1:34:49] You know, when people do the works of
[1:34:50] the day,
[1:34:52] you can see that these are the works of
[1:34:53] the day
[1:34:56] because there's a there's a greater
[1:34:57] light.
[1:34:59] Are we together? Amen. You can see the
[1:35:03] greater light
[1:35:05] allows you to do the works of the day.
[1:35:10] But there are people who are waiting
[1:35:12] for the lesser light
[1:35:15] because during the day they can't
[1:35:17] operate.
[1:35:20] They wait for the lesser light
[1:35:22] and then during that light they know
[1:35:25] that now this is our time.
[1:35:30] They have works
[1:35:32] &gt;&gt; of the devil.
[1:35:38] Um
[1:35:41] I once
[1:35:43] said something
[1:35:47] &gt;&gt; that you know
[1:35:50] in the house
[1:35:53] if you are troubled
[1:35:57] &gt;&gt; by this there some this um calling
[1:36:01] insects
[1:36:05] They call them maf.
[1:36:07] &gt;&gt; They call them cockroaches.
[1:36:14] &gt;&gt; So you'll recall that
[1:36:18] they are very effective when there's no
[1:36:20] light.
[1:36:25] &gt;&gt; So if you come in the night
[1:36:29] and it's off, it slides off.
[1:36:35] And there's a problem in the house.
[1:36:37] If you say
[1:36:41] you'll see children of darkness
[1:36:45] taking cover,
[1:36:48] they just show you.
[1:36:51] They operate better.
[1:36:54] They strive better
[1:36:56] when it's dark.
[1:36:58] But there are other people
[1:37:00] that you will see they are blossoming
[1:37:03] better
[1:37:06] when it's day because they are children
[1:37:09] of the day
[1:37:11] not of the night.
[1:37:14] They are part of the light.
[1:37:18] That light lives in them.
[1:37:21] And that light keeps them in check.
[1:37:26] Even if you gossip about them,
[1:37:30] they just looking in themselves.
[1:37:33] Is anything wrong with me?
[1:37:36] If they still find the light is still
[1:37:38] there,
[1:37:39] they cannot be bothered
[1:37:45] because they have to walk the talk
[1:37:50] and the talk is the Bible.
[1:37:53] This is the great light.
[1:37:56] that man ever saw
[1:37:59] that started there came into the pyramid
[1:38:03] and came here.
[1:38:05] &gt;&gt; It's a light.
[1:38:07] &gt;&gt; The word
[1:38:09] now in the beginning,
[1:38:12] God created the heaven and the earth.
[1:38:16] Let me not go there.
[1:38:19] I was just trying to recap
[1:38:24] just to show you
[1:38:26] Um when we talk about the children of
[1:38:29] the light,
[1:38:31] how did the whole thing start
[1:38:34] and starting it
[1:38:37] before the foundation of the world?
[1:38:40] &gt;&gt; Now this thing of the this thing has
[1:38:43] always been troubling me.
[1:38:47] Um you know about before the foundation
[1:38:52] of the world
[1:38:56] In this sense,
[1:39:00] &gt;&gt; maybe let me put it correctly.
[1:39:04] It made me curious
[1:39:09] more about it.
[1:39:13] Um
[1:39:15] because it it indicates
[1:39:19] that there was a civilization
[1:39:23] &gt;&gt; before before this civilization.
[1:39:29] Yes. Amen. So before this civilization
[1:39:33] there was another civilization
[1:39:38] because
[1:39:40] that civilization
[1:39:43] is the one that
[1:39:46] God
[1:39:49] &gt;&gt; you know Job was tried
[1:39:54] and actually job it's just um the devil.
[1:39:58] Amen. um that went to God
[1:40:09] or God
[1:40:11] &gt;&gt; knew that Job
[1:40:14] &gt;&gt; is part of the light
[1:40:17] and him being part of the light
[1:40:20] because remember I said there's
[1:40:22] something special that God did
[1:40:26] about the earth
[1:40:28] and that special thing
[1:40:30] is that there is something that's come
[1:40:33] from another civilization
[1:40:36] that dropped into this civilization.
[1:40:41] Are you with me?
[1:40:43] &gt;&gt; Let me repeat myself a little bit. Amen.
[1:40:46] There is something in this civilization
[1:40:50] that comes from another civilization
[1:40:56] and when it's here in this civilization
[1:41:03] let's read job then we combine it
[1:41:07] so that I can get to to the other things
[1:41:10] here.
[1:41:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:41:12] &gt;&gt; Job 38 again. Uh Job 38
[1:41:19] it says, "Then the Lord answered Job out
[1:41:22] of a whirlwind and said,
[1:41:29] "Who is this that darken counsel by
[1:41:31] words without knowledge?"
[1:41:36] Amen.
[1:41:55] Yeah. Get up now thy loans like a man
[1:42:00] for I will demand of thee
[1:42:03] and answer thou me.
[1:42:09] Okay, let me try and maybe elaborate
[1:42:11] something here.
[1:42:14] The prophet says
[1:42:20] &gt;&gt; Job
[1:42:21] &gt;&gt; Job
[1:42:24] came to a point
[1:42:28] where
[1:42:31] because remember
[1:42:34] he was a blessed man.
[1:42:38] He was a man
[1:42:42] &gt;&gt; that didn't do any evil.
[1:42:46] &gt;&gt; He was living upright.
[1:42:51] But the prophet somewhere says
[1:42:56] you know he somewhere Job had he was
[1:42:59] proud
[1:43:04] and that is why God came to him now
[1:43:08] and said to him get up your lungs
[1:43:13] I want to talk to you now and answer me
[1:43:16] if you
[1:43:18] And this is what made me very curious
[1:43:23] because you know as I was reading it
[1:43:27] I could realize that
[1:43:32] God
[1:43:35] has people
[1:43:38] that were with him
[1:43:40] before the foundation of the world.
[1:43:43] That that's why he asked Job this
[1:43:45] question.
[1:43:46] Where was thou when I laid the
[1:43:48] foundation of
[1:43:51] deter if thou has understanding?
[1:43:56] Who had laid the measure thereof?
[1:44:01] If thou knowest,
[1:44:04] or who had stretched the line upon it,
[1:44:11] whereupon are the foundations thereof
[1:44:14] fastened,
[1:44:16] or who laid the cornerstone thereof.
[1:44:25] When the morning stars sang together
[1:44:32] and
[1:44:33] all the sons of God shouted for joy,
[1:44:39] it was question after question after
[1:44:41] question
[1:44:43] to Job. small
[1:44:44] &gt;&gt; God asking him where were you
[1:44:49] &gt;&gt; and answer me if you have understanding.
[1:44:54] &gt;&gt; Now this is what I want to send
[1:45:01] God
[1:45:05] needed an answer
[1:45:08] while he had an answer.
[1:45:13] He wanted to show
[1:45:16] job that job
[1:45:18] I'm in charge here.
[1:45:25] Um, you must know your your space
[1:45:31] and I know my space.
[1:45:35] Then I started to be curious around this
[1:45:39] address, you know.
[1:45:41] Then when I looked upon when I looked
[1:45:43] closer
[1:45:45] I saw that actually the whole thing that
[1:45:50] God is asking Job
[1:45:54] it's plain in the creation
[1:45:58] if you follow the creation
[1:46:01] you will see that
[1:46:04] it's a plain thing.
[1:46:07] Now um the prophet explains it like
[1:46:11] this.
[1:46:13] He says or let me say he interprets it
[1:46:16] like this.
[1:46:18] He says
[1:46:22] before the foundation
[1:46:25] when we in interpreting it
[1:46:30] is before the world was formed.
[1:46:37] Because in my mind
[1:46:39] I was already looking for
[1:46:44] some
[1:46:46] foundation
[1:46:49] because I've got I've got an idea that
[1:46:51] the house
[1:46:54] when you build it, you must have you
[1:46:58] must dig
[1:47:00] &gt;&gt; and that's the foundation.
[1:47:02] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:47:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. you dig
[1:47:05] that is the foundation.
[1:47:08] Now I I'm wondering
[1:47:10] because when I look at the earth
[1:47:13] &gt;&gt; and the planets
[1:47:16] &gt;&gt; I see them they in space
[1:47:21] but the prophet has answered us
[1:47:24] because it says
[1:47:27] he spoke something shot out
[1:47:31] &gt;&gt; and he said stop. Amen.
[1:47:35] &gt;&gt; So you know what's holding everything
[1:47:38] &gt;&gt; is the word.
[1:47:42] &gt;&gt; The foundation
[1:47:43] &gt;&gt; is the word.
[1:47:48] &gt;&gt; You don't have to look for shovels and
[1:47:51] other things.
[1:47:53] No,
[1:47:55] &gt;&gt; he said stop
[1:47:58] and it stopped. Now, naturally speaking,
[1:48:02] all these planets
[1:48:05] are held by a magnetic power
[1:48:10] that's coming from the sun.
[1:48:13] The sun has got so much energy
[1:48:16] that it's holding them.
[1:48:21] The prophet says if one planet was not
[1:48:25] was out of its cater
[1:48:29] the earth was going to go directly to
[1:48:32] the sun
[1:48:34] and explode
[1:48:37] but the magnetic power.
[1:48:41] Okay. All these things are coming from
[1:48:43] the sun.
[1:48:45] So there's a magnetic power between the
[1:48:48] sun and the planet.
[1:48:51] The sun rules over all of them
[1:48:56] and it's got power to keep them in their
[1:48:59] position.
[1:49:02] That is why somewhere here it talks
[1:49:04] about the line.
[1:49:06] It's part of the foundation.
[1:49:09] Some it talks of a line
[1:49:14] &gt;&gt; because Yeah.
[1:49:16] In verse five, verse five, he says, "Who
[1:49:18] had laid the measure thereof?"
[1:49:22] If thou knowest or who had stretched the
[1:49:25] line upon it.
[1:49:29] So each planet
[1:49:31] has got a line has got a track where
[1:49:34] it's moving.
[1:49:36] Are we together?
[1:49:39] That check. It's a foundation
[1:49:43] because a foundation it's a position
[1:49:48] that's where you are placed
[1:49:51] where you are placed you are given a tag
[1:49:55] that your tag is this one. Now if you
[1:50:00] look at those texts Mercury
[1:50:02] &gt;&gt; has got the shortest track.
[1:50:06] Maybe let me try and explain it in.
[1:50:10] When you go to those that run,
[1:50:13] you go to the stadium, when they place
[1:50:16] them on their tracks,
[1:50:19] they don't place them straight like
[1:50:21] this.
[1:50:22] I'm talking about the relay runners
[1:50:25] or the sprinters.
[1:50:27] Are we together? They don't put them in
[1:50:29] one line.
[1:50:32] It's because they are tracks.
[1:50:35] The first track has got the shortest
[1:50:37] distance.
[1:50:41] The last track
[1:50:43] has got the fairest distance.
[1:50:47] That is why the first man will be right
[1:50:51] behind
[1:50:53] and and the one on the last track
[1:50:57] will be ahead. When you look at it, you
[1:51:01] say it's unfair.
[1:51:03] But they have made the measurements
[1:51:07] and according to the measurements
[1:51:10] if they run from here and one starting
[1:51:13] from here when they end where they
[1:51:17] finish
[1:51:19] it's going to be the same distance
[1:51:24] but God gave different tracks
[1:51:28] and then if you cross your track you get
[1:51:30] disqualified disqualified.
[1:51:34] number one. Even if you are number one,
[1:51:36] you must keep your track.
[1:51:40] Amen.
[1:51:43] So in disqualification is is sad
[1:51:49] because they let you run
[1:51:51] the course,
[1:51:53] but when you get to the finish line,
[1:51:56] they pull out the red card,
[1:52:00] right at the finishing.
[1:52:04] So you better be careful.
[1:52:07] Whose line are you looking at?
[1:52:17] The light
[1:52:19] &gt;&gt; gave them their position.
[1:52:22] &gt;&gt; Mercury Mercury
[1:52:23] &gt;&gt; has got the shortest distance.
[1:52:26] &gt;&gt; So it means when the takes 365
[1:52:30] 365 Mercury takes short.
[1:52:33] &gt;&gt; I didn't calculate it. I don't know how
[1:52:35] long, but I'm just demonstrating to you
[1:52:39] that the distance of these things
[1:52:42] is not the same.
[1:52:44] Others take longer
[1:52:47] to finish the same distance
[1:52:50] because their track
[1:52:54] is long.
[1:52:57] Others closer to the sun, they overtake
[1:53:01] even others.
[1:53:06] As people we are not the same and equal
[1:53:11] with another person gauge with what God
[1:53:15] has given in you
[1:53:18] that God which has given you
[1:53:22] will make you run the pace.
[1:53:26] You'll speak like Paul. I have run the
[1:53:29] race. I have finished the course.
[1:53:32] I'm only waiting.
[1:53:40] &gt;&gt; I'm waiting for the cap
[1:53:43] &gt;&gt; because potentially I'm a graduate
[1:53:47] graduate.
[1:53:49] Are we together? Amen.
[1:53:52] That's the the snapshot
[1:53:56] of or the recap
[1:53:59] of what we were trying to say last.
[1:54:01] Amen.
[1:54:02] &gt;&gt; But now let me come to now
[1:54:07] you must know that
[1:54:10] we are also orbiting around the sun
[1:54:16] and we not not not the sun.
[1:54:20] We orbit around the s.
[1:54:27] &gt;&gt; He gives us he gave us our tracks, our
[1:54:29] lives
[1:54:34] and he gave us before
[1:54:36] &gt;&gt; the foundation
[1:54:39] before the foundation of this world.
[1:54:42] So this means
[1:54:44] before this world war was
[1:54:47] you were
[1:54:49] the things that you see they're not new
[1:54:58] and if they're not new.
[1:55:00] You see somebody that's not seeing
[1:55:02] things for the first time
[1:55:04] is matured.
[1:55:08] You know if you take yourself
[1:55:10] and you reverse your life
[1:55:15] but having the knowledge that you have
[1:55:16] now.
[1:55:18] I promise you there are a lot of things
[1:55:22] that when you were young
[1:55:25] you would have done different
[1:55:28] &gt;&gt; your mother was trying to tell you hey
[1:55:31] don't take this route
[1:55:34] &gt;&gt; and you only say
[1:55:41] yeah
[1:55:44] &gt;&gt; so
[1:55:47] the other one is saying
[1:55:48] &gt;&gt; I was not there when they were young.
[1:55:52] Now they want to disturb me.
[1:55:55] But when you come to that spot
[1:55:58] and you reverse, then you remember your
[1:56:00] mother.
[1:56:02] Hey, my mother told me this. Hey, my
[1:56:04] father told me this. Look where I am
[1:56:07] now.
[1:56:09] Pastor told me this thing.
[1:56:13] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[1:56:17] If if you didn't start here,
[1:56:21] &gt;&gt; you're not confused by you by youth
[1:56:25] confused
[1:56:28] in the sense that peer pressure
[1:56:32] holds you.
[1:56:35] Amen. There's a certain light
[1:56:39] that makes you to act different
[1:56:42] and that make you to understand
[1:56:45] even in your workplace.
[1:56:47] They know that there are certain things
[1:56:50] that this one will never do.
[1:56:56] Why is because these things are not new.
[1:57:01] You saw them before
[1:57:05] and you you opted to take the light
[1:57:09] or the light opted to take you.
[1:57:12] Let's put it better. The light opted to
[1:57:16] take from you
[1:57:20] and it transformed you to something
[1:57:23] different
[1:57:25] to something beautiful
[1:57:28] to something
[1:57:30] that you yourself
[1:57:32] when you look back you have no regrets.
[1:57:36] You know you say since I repented
[1:57:41] I don't I have no regrets
[1:57:48] &gt;&gt; then you know
[1:57:51] &gt;&gt; I have arrived
[1:57:54] &gt;&gt; then you don't change
[1:57:56] &gt;&gt; amen
[1:57:56] &gt;&gt; okay it is we are children of the light
[1:58:00] &gt;&gt; who are following the light
[1:58:02] &gt;&gt; this light that we
[1:58:06] It's our
[1:58:09] it's our it's our guide.
[1:58:12] &gt;&gt; Let me let me go now to this
[1:58:16] what I want us to look at the angle
[1:58:21] today.
[1:58:24] The other one was just recaping from
[1:58:27] last,
[1:58:29] &gt;&gt; but let's let's let's pick up
[1:58:34] John.
[1:58:34] &gt;&gt; John chapter one.
[1:58:38] And here
[1:58:40] &gt;&gt; in the book of John,
[1:58:43] &gt;&gt; let's read from verse one to verse 9.
[1:58:54] In the beginning was the word and the
[1:58:56] word was with God and the word was God.
[1:58:59] The same was in the beginning with God.
[1:59:02] All things were made by him and without
[1:59:04] him was nothing. Was not anything made
[1:59:08] that was made. In him was life and the
[1:59:11] life was the light of man. And the light
[1:59:15] shineth in darkness and the darkness
[1:59:18] comprehended it not. There was a man
[1:59:21] sent from God whose name was John. The
[1:59:24] same came for a witness to bear witness
[1:59:28] of the light that all men through him
[1:59:31] might believe. He was not that light but
[1:59:34] was sent to bear witness of that light.
[1:59:38] That was the true light which lighteneth
[1:59:41] every man that cometh into the world.
[1:59:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:47] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Um,
[1:59:50] so I'm picking up John.
[1:59:53] Um, because this is also another
[1:59:57] beginning
[2:00:00] because it says in the beginning was the
[2:00:01] word
[2:00:03] and the word was God
[2:00:06] and the word was with God.
[2:00:09] And then in in Genesis one
[2:00:12] verse one
[2:00:14] that one says
[2:00:16] in the beginning God created
[2:00:20] the heaven and the earth.
[2:00:22] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:00:24] That was the beginning of creation.
[2:00:29] Now here John
[2:00:32] picks up another beginning.
[2:00:35] God has no beginning. God has no ending.
[2:00:39] But God
[2:00:41] take a certain form
[2:00:44] in order for us, in order for human to
[2:00:48] have an idea
[2:00:50] who is God.
[2:00:53] God is a spirit.
[2:00:55] But being a spirit, he made man. Now he
[2:00:59] loves this man. Now he wants this man to
[2:01:03] have an idea of who God is.
[2:01:09] Now
[2:01:10] that is why John says
[2:01:13] in verse one in the beginning was the
[2:01:17] word.
[2:01:19] The word it's a spiritual thing.
[2:01:23] Are we together?
[2:01:26] That is why Jesus once said,
[2:01:30] "The words that I speak to you,
[2:01:33] they are spirit
[2:01:35] and they are alive."
[2:01:37] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:01:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:01:39] So now this beginning it's actually the
[2:01:44] unfolding
[2:01:46] of God because God
[2:01:50] wants
[2:01:52] he wants us.
[2:01:55] He he condescend he's condescending
[2:01:59] to something
[2:02:02] that is tangible.
[2:02:05] Amen.
[2:02:06] &gt;&gt; That is why in first John
[2:02:10] we read that that which was from there
[2:02:15] &gt;&gt; which we have handled
[2:02:17] &gt;&gt; which we have seen are we together.
[2:02:23] So if you take all these things
[2:02:26] you'll realize that God
[2:02:29] um
[2:02:31] came to be a man.
[2:02:34] Amen.
[2:02:38] &gt;&gt; So that men
[2:02:40] &gt;&gt; can understand
[2:02:42] that he also is a small god.
[2:02:49] &gt;&gt; So that men can realize and appreciate
[2:02:51] that.
[2:02:54] I am a god.
[2:03:00] If you can come to that stage
[2:03:03] then then you are a child of light.
[2:03:08] &gt;&gt; Okay. It says here
[2:03:09] &gt;&gt; two
[2:03:11] &gt;&gt; the same was in the beginning with God.
[2:03:16] I'll come back and explain this verse.
[2:03:19] Two.
[2:03:21] &gt;&gt; Let me
[2:03:23] read three. It says all things were made
[2:03:26] by him.
[2:03:28] And without him
[2:03:31] was not anything made that was made.
[2:03:35] Now if you listen carefully you will
[2:03:38] realize that now the weight start to
[2:03:41] become him
[2:03:43] in the beginning was the weight was God
[2:03:48] the same
[2:03:50] was God.
[2:03:52] So the the whole thing is the same.
[2:03:56] And then he says
[2:03:59] &gt;&gt; all things were made by him
[2:04:03] &gt;&gt; is the same.
[2:04:08] Okay.
[2:04:10] &gt;&gt; I'll come back to that on the issue of
[2:04:14] the same.
[2:04:16] So this hymn
[2:04:19] is now the it's it's actually alluding
[2:04:21] to the sun
[2:04:25] the s now
[2:04:28] because
[2:04:30] um
[2:04:32] the prophet said
[2:04:35] he was the weight
[2:04:37] &gt;&gt; which is the logos
[2:04:40] and then when he came down became a man.
[2:04:45] And then it says, "In him was life and
[2:04:47] the life was the light of man.
[2:04:52] And the light shined in darkness
[2:04:56] and darkness comprehended.
[2:05:03] Do you see light and darkness?
[2:05:07] Darkness
[2:05:08] is the absence of light.
[2:05:13] Then we say it's dark.
[2:05:15] Because this the light is not there.
[2:05:19] But when the light comes,
[2:05:22] darkness disappears.
[2:05:26] That is why. When a child of God comes,
[2:05:30] the environment changes.
[2:05:34] Because darkness cannot comprehend
[2:05:37] light.
[2:05:40] When light comes,
[2:05:42] darkness disappears.
[2:05:49] and not understanding.
[2:05:52] &gt;&gt; I was resting here
[2:05:55] but someone just came and I'm feeling so
[2:05:59] weak.
[2:06:00] My body is aching
[2:06:04] because the powers
[2:06:08] one is of light
[2:06:10] one is of darkness. The power of light
[2:06:15] does not talk too much.
[2:06:19] Waits for God to express.
[2:06:28] Then it says there was a man sent from
[2:06:32] God whose name was John.
[2:06:38] Now
[2:06:40] it it's picking up another man
[2:06:45] and pastor taught us very well
[2:06:49] that this man was not sent by
[2:06:54] was sent from.
[2:06:59] Yes. Amen.
[2:07:01] &gt;&gt; Similar as the planets are coming from
[2:07:02] the sun.
[2:07:05] So John
[2:07:07] was coming
[2:07:09] from God.
[2:07:12] &gt;&gt; It's a He comes from another
[2:07:14] dispensation.
[2:07:16] John is coming from another dispensation
[2:07:21] before the foundation of the world. John
[2:07:24] was there.
[2:07:26] But at our allotted time,
[2:07:29] there was a spirit
[2:07:32] that moved
[2:07:34] from eternity
[2:07:36] and it crossed all the planets
[2:07:40] and it dropped down to John.
[2:07:44] Amen.
[2:07:48] &gt;&gt; And that spirit,
[2:07:50] &gt;&gt; it dropped to John before he was born.
[2:07:57] vindicating
[2:08:00] that this is the work of the Lord
[2:08:04] because Elizabeth
[2:08:06] was worried.
[2:08:09] &gt;&gt; No muscles shaking, nothing.
[2:08:16] But when when when the two lights met
[2:08:20] in their mothers
[2:08:24] and then when the mothers greeted each
[2:08:25] other,
[2:08:29] &gt;&gt; the heavens
[2:08:31] ignited
[2:08:34] and gave life
[2:08:37] &gt;&gt; to to John
[2:08:41] and John. So John when he was here,
[2:08:44] he was born already predestinated of
[2:08:46] God.
[2:08:50] Is there something that you could do to
[2:08:51] John?
[2:08:53] You could take him to any university.
[2:08:57] That was the child of God.
[2:09:00] God took him to the wilderness himself.
[2:09:04] God purposefully brought John
[2:09:08] when the parents were old,
[2:09:12] &gt;&gt; knowing that
[2:09:18] the days are numbered. And then John
[2:09:21] came.
[2:09:23] &gt;&gt; And then when John came,
[2:09:26] &gt;&gt; God closed the files.
[2:09:28] &gt;&gt; Elizabeth, Elizabeth,
[2:09:30] &gt;&gt; who was the father, by the way? and
[2:09:34] Zachariah.
[2:09:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:36] &gt;&gt; Then he said, "This one is mine."
[2:09:41] &gt;&gt; And then even before he closed the
[2:09:42] files,
[2:09:43] John John already loved to stay in the
[2:09:45] wilderness.
[2:09:50] And when he was preaching, he was
[2:09:52] preaching from the wilderness.
[2:09:56] But because he got there, he had the
[2:09:58] magnetic power.
[2:10:00] People moved from the cities
[2:10:03] coming to the wilderness
[2:10:07] because of the magnetic power
[2:10:09] of the light that was in John
[2:10:17] had serious magnetic power
[2:10:23] and even his his um what do you call
[2:10:25] this thing? Um
[2:10:30] you know when you make examples
[2:10:33] he used nature
[2:10:36] parables.
[2:10:37] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:10:39] &gt;&gt; When he used parables
[2:10:41] &gt;&gt; he used nature
[2:10:43] &gt;&gt; showing that his university
[2:10:48] was the nature itself.
[2:10:52] The best universe you can ever find
[2:10:55] is the natural one.
[2:11:00] No minisc there.
[2:11:03] Let's read about this.
[2:11:06] And then it says the same came for a
[2:11:08] witness
[2:11:10] to bear witness of the light
[2:11:14] that all men through him might believe.
[2:11:18] He was not that light,
[2:11:21] but was sent to bear witness of that
[2:11:23] light.
[2:11:27] That was the true light which lighted
[2:11:30] every man that cometh into the world.
[2:11:37] So let me it says here
[2:11:40] &gt;&gt; he came for a witness
[2:11:45] and bearing witness of the light.
[2:11:49] Now in verse seven
[2:11:51] &gt;&gt; it says the same came for a witness.
[2:11:57] Now this is what I said I will explain
[2:11:59] later
[2:12:00] because in verse two it says the same
[2:12:03] was in the beginning with God.
[2:12:07] Now it goes on again. And it says the
[2:12:09] same
[2:12:13] came for a witness
[2:12:16] to bear witness of the light.
[2:12:19] &gt;&gt; So there you see here
[2:12:21] &gt;&gt; the light
[2:12:23] &gt;&gt; it's the light with a capital L
[2:12:27] in verse seven.
[2:12:30] &gt;&gt; It's a light with capital L
[2:12:35] that all men through him might believe.
[2:12:39] And then it says he was not that light
[2:12:42] with a capital L.
[2:12:44] But he was coming to bear witness of
[2:12:46] that light.
[2:12:49] But when it started, remember that
[2:12:52] it says he came from God.
[2:12:57] So in other words, God gave you gave
[2:13:01] John
[2:13:03] a small portion
[2:13:05] of himself.
[2:13:08] &gt;&gt; And then that that that one was light,
[2:13:12] but we can't write it with a capital L.
[2:13:16] We'll write it with a small L.
[2:13:18] So when it says here, he was not that
[2:13:20] light.
[2:13:22] He was not the source
[2:13:25] but he was coming to bear witness of the
[2:13:27] source.
[2:13:31] But if we put it plain
[2:13:35] because we are believers.
[2:13:37] The prophet says
[2:13:40] if you take a drop from the ocean
[2:13:43] just a cup.
[2:13:45] He says potentially
[2:13:49] all the contents of the of the ocean
[2:13:52] in you. Are we together? So John though
[2:13:58] he was bearing witness of the light but
[2:14:01] he had the same.
[2:14:04] So this same
[2:14:06] keeps on going it is the same the same
[2:14:11] the same now we are not repeating
[2:14:14] ourselves.
[2:14:16] We are processing
[2:14:23] &gt;&gt; so that
[2:14:25] we can come to a point
[2:14:28] &gt;&gt; where we can appreciate
[2:14:31] what the Lord
[2:14:34] &gt;&gt; has done
[2:14:36] for mommy lord.
[2:14:42] Amen.
[2:14:44] It's not
[2:14:46] the making
[2:14:49] of a man.
[2:14:51] It's God building his own church.
[2:15:01] Now
[2:15:06] &gt;&gt; this night that we are talking about
[2:15:11] &gt;&gt; it requires
[2:15:14] &gt;&gt; that we
[2:15:17] become
[2:15:19] &gt;&gt; a different breed
[2:15:23] &gt;&gt; in the sense.
[2:15:26] &gt;&gt; You see
[2:15:28] um the um
[2:15:30] in the natural.
[2:15:33] There are those that are called
[2:15:34] astronauts
[2:15:36] astronauts. These are people
[2:15:40] that study the zodiac
[2:15:43] and they don't only study it.
[2:15:46] They even go
[2:15:48] to the outer space.
[2:15:52] Now for you to be an astronaut,
[2:15:56] you know, you must be good with
[2:15:58] measurements.
[2:16:01] Your mathematics must be good.
[2:16:13] Then they just say condone you.
[2:16:19] You must pass with distinction
[2:16:23] to be that.
[2:16:25] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:16:27] In other words, you must be smart.
[2:16:32] You know, understand measurements.
[2:16:36] You know, when they talk when they talk
[2:16:37] about the speed of light,
[2:16:40] you must understand.
[2:16:42] And they talk about light years.
[2:16:47] It's a different language.
[2:16:51] And we no longer talking when we say
[2:16:52] light years.
[2:16:55] We have moved.
[2:16:57] to another level.
[2:17:00] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:17:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:02] &gt;&gt; Now
[2:17:06] we
[2:17:07] are spiritual astronauts.
[2:17:12] &gt;&gt; When it come to the word,
[2:17:15] &gt;&gt; we know the measurements.
[2:17:19] &gt;&gt; And when we pick you up, we pick you by
[2:17:22] the spirit that's operating in you.
[2:17:30] because the spirit will not fool you.
[2:17:34] &gt;&gt; Now
[2:17:37] these astronauts the astronauts
[2:17:41] um because they
[2:17:44] they study
[2:17:46] and they're looking
[2:17:48] they're not just studying
[2:17:50] &gt;&gt; actually
[2:17:52] you know there are certain things that I
[2:17:54] wanted to read
[2:17:56] Um maybe I will read it.
[2:17:59] Um but it's like this.
[2:18:05] &gt;&gt; Um the prophet
[2:18:09] speaks
[2:18:13] the that this world this missile earth.
[2:18:19] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:18:22] inside it.
[2:18:26] It's got um
[2:18:31] gas,
[2:18:33] oil,
[2:18:36] water,
[2:18:38] h simply put
[2:18:42] it's explosive,
[2:18:48] cuz he said two of it
[2:18:53] It's water.
[2:18:55] &gt;&gt; And it says water.
[2:18:57] &gt;&gt; It's hydrogen and oxygen.
[2:19:01] &gt;&gt; Explosive
[2:19:05] where we were sitting.
[2:19:07] &gt;&gt; Yeah. This is this is this is what I
[2:19:08] wanted. My god.
[2:19:10] &gt;&gt; Yeah. It says and and the two of the
[2:19:13] earth
[2:19:16] &gt;&gt; better than two of it is in water.
[2:19:23] And oneird of it is in land
[2:19:30] about one/3
[2:19:32] &gt;&gt; and this is little.
[2:19:35] So it means greater part is water
[2:19:39] this crust that we are living on.
[2:19:42] It's full of dangerous explosives,
[2:19:48] gas, gasoline, oil, everything.
[2:19:54] Is that right? Amen.
[2:19:56] &gt;&gt; Those of you are in mining, you know.
[2:20:01] &gt;&gt; And the two of it
[2:20:06] water.
[2:20:08] The formula of water
[2:20:11] two parts is hydrogen
[2:20:15] one part oxygen
[2:20:18] explosive
[2:20:20] and somewhere says as we are sitting
[2:20:22] here below us is hell
[2:20:27] there's there's some heat there
[2:20:32] if God can open for for us
[2:20:36] this church would be full. Amen.
[2:20:39] If you can open for us hell,
[2:20:42] this church will always be full.
[2:20:49] &gt;&gt; Now,
[2:20:51] &gt;&gt; I was saying to you,
[2:20:55] &gt;&gt; the astronauts, astronauts,
[2:20:58] &gt;&gt; it's people
[2:21:00] that study
[2:21:03] &gt;&gt; and they studying.
[2:21:05] Remember these ones are not are not
[2:21:07] spiritual like us.
[2:21:10] We are spiritual astronauts.
[2:21:14] Can I get amen? Amen.
[2:21:18] &gt;&gt; These ones they are astronauts
[2:21:21] astronauts
[2:21:22] &gt;&gt; naturally speaking.
[2:21:25] Now
[2:21:26] part of their deal
[2:21:29] though they don't disclose it.
[2:21:33] They're actually looking
[2:21:36] which planet
[2:21:38] that we can go
[2:21:40] &gt;&gt; because rapture is coming
[2:21:43] &gt;&gt; and hell hell
[2:21:45] &gt;&gt; is going to be on earth.
[2:21:48] &gt;&gt; So we need another planet
[2:21:50] where we can migrate
[2:21:54] you know to run away from the earth of
[2:21:56] God.
[2:21:58] Can you run away from the earth of God?
[2:22:01] God made the earth
[2:22:04] and the earth alone to be habitable.
[2:22:10] So they actually know that rapture is
[2:22:11] coming
[2:22:13] and hell is around the corner.
[2:22:16] It's going to be here on earth.
[2:22:20] Now I'm bringing to us that we
[2:22:25] let me say something about them though
[2:22:28] that I should give them credit
[2:22:33] because it's a risky job.
[2:22:37] So if you know when they go
[2:22:42] they don't wear in a suit like me
[2:22:45] they've got a special attire
[2:22:48] they jump into that one
[2:22:51] and they've got helmet
[2:22:56] even if they pass
[2:22:58] you can see they not walking normal now
[2:23:04] they don't now walk with this gravity
[2:23:07] They have a gravity of where they're
[2:23:09] going.
[2:23:09] &gt;&gt; They like hopping.
[2:23:14] You have seen them.
[2:23:18] Now
[2:23:20] what they're doing actually
[2:23:23] there's no guarantee
[2:23:26] that you will come back.
[2:23:29] &gt;&gt; You can go and it can be a oneway
[2:23:31] ticket.
[2:23:38] because
[2:23:40] it is it's another environment.
[2:23:48] Whatever you're using to get there
[2:23:51] might not be able to to come
[2:23:54] and if he doesn't
[2:23:57] then you're in trouble.
[2:23:59] &gt;&gt; Then you have to communicate maybe with
[2:24:01] the tower down there.
[2:24:03] this communication.
[2:24:05] But this is the credit that I want to
[2:24:07] give them
[2:24:10] that they are prepared
[2:24:12] to take one one way ticket.
[2:24:16] If you can find somebody who is willing
[2:24:20] to take a oneway ticket
[2:24:23] like
[2:24:24] he took a oneway ticket
[2:24:31] but because he's a spiritual astronaut.
[2:24:35] He is in a better space
[2:24:40] and I must be honest
[2:24:46] sometimes when I think
[2:24:48] as a human being
[2:24:50] I get this thoughts that
[2:24:53] you know God wherever he is with pastor
[2:24:57] and the saints
[2:24:59] he's able to say look at the brethren
[2:25:02] down
[2:25:13] So if you know him,
[2:25:16] &gt;&gt; you know what he wants.
[2:25:18] &gt;&gt; That is if you know him.
[2:25:27] Now
[2:25:31] &gt;&gt; I'm also ready for a one ticket by the
[2:25:33] way.
[2:25:37] &gt;&gt; Um
[2:25:39] all of you actually you are ready.
[2:25:43] That's what Paul says.
[2:25:45] Paul says, "If it was me,
[2:25:52] &gt;&gt; but because I'm still here
[2:25:56] because I'm still here." But here is
[2:26:00] here's the thing
[2:26:05] &gt;&gt; which I want us to look at as we are
[2:26:09] looking now at the spiritual part of it
[2:26:14] because the spiritual astronauts
[2:26:18] their duty is to follow the light
[2:26:23] and why are they following that light?
[2:26:26] It's because of the magnetic power
[2:26:30] that is in that light.
[2:26:35] It's able to translate
[2:26:40] us
[2:26:42] &gt;&gt; into sons
[2:26:45] of God.
[2:26:48] You know the translation power,
[2:26:52] it's something that
[2:26:55] when
[2:26:57] it hits
[2:27:03] you, you don't have an option.
[2:27:08] It's God himself
[2:27:11] doing his work.
[2:27:16] Now
[2:27:18] &gt;&gt; let me read uh Colossians Colossians 1
[2:27:21] verse 13
[2:27:24] &gt;&gt; just to
[2:27:43] you can read it for us my brother.
[2:27:44] Colossians 1:3.
[2:27:46] &gt;&gt; Colossians chapter 1 verse 13.
[2:27:48] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:27:50] &gt;&gt; Who hath delivered us from the power of
[2:27:52] darkness and have translated us into the
[2:27:56] kingdom of his dear son.
[2:28:00] Yeah. Now Paul here
[2:28:04] he's talking about the father
[2:28:06] you know he says giving thanks to the
[2:28:08] father
[2:28:11] &gt;&gt; which had made us meet to be partakers
[2:28:13] of the inheritance of the saints in
[2:28:15] light.
[2:28:22] So to partake
[2:28:25] it must be in light.
[2:28:28] You know light is something very great.
[2:28:32] Even when you want to test
[2:28:36] um something that is not fake or not
[2:28:39] fake.
[2:28:43] You want to test money.
[2:28:45] You know they put it under the light.
[2:28:48] They know that something is going to
[2:28:50] reflect.
[2:28:53] The paper
[2:28:55] they're not worried about. But there's
[2:28:57] something that is like magnetic.
[2:29:03] It's more like it's a it's not paper.
[2:29:07] It's more like it's plastic.
[2:29:10] &gt;&gt; It's like it's magnet.
[2:29:12] When you flash it in that light,
[2:29:15] it starts to show something
[2:29:18] that the imposters
[2:29:22] the imposters
[2:29:24] um
[2:29:26] by
[2:29:29] &gt;&gt; the imposters.
[2:29:32] Those that Yes. Yes.
[2:29:34] &gt;&gt; Yes. So that the imposters
[2:29:37] &gt;&gt; will never be able
[2:29:40] &gt;&gt; to emulate it. They don't have the
[2:29:42] material
[2:29:44] to emulate that
[2:29:46] for you to see that. It must be put
[2:29:49] under the light.
[2:29:51] If you hold it like this,
[2:29:53] it's just an it's it's just paper. But
[2:29:56] if you put it under the right light,
[2:30:00] it start to glow
[2:30:02] showing that this is genuine this is not
[2:30:05] genuine. So light is able to bring
[2:30:10] the difference between a true Christian
[2:30:15] and a make believer
[2:30:17] because you find make believers and you
[2:30:20] find Christians.
[2:30:22] But it is the light that is able to put
[2:30:26] them under itself
[2:30:29] and under the supervision of the light
[2:30:32] you will see reflections.
[2:30:35] You don't have to rush.
[2:30:38] Take your time and look at it. Then you
[2:30:42] will see as it moves that this is of God
[2:30:46] and this is not of God.
[2:30:54] That that that's how our spiritual
[2:30:59] part
[2:31:02] is.
[2:31:04] um structured.
[2:31:07] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:31:09] Now, um,
[2:31:12] in closing,
[2:31:16] don't forget that
[2:31:20] &gt;&gt; you
[2:31:24] were delivered
[2:31:26] from the power of darkness
[2:31:31] and translated
[2:31:34] &gt;&gt; into a kingdom
[2:31:36] of his dear S.
[2:31:41] Now in the kingdom of the s
[2:31:45] that is where there is peace,
[2:31:48] longsuffering,
[2:31:51] &gt;&gt; praying for one another.
[2:31:53] Are we together? That is the the the
[2:31:57] kingdom of the son.
[2:32:00] Now um let me pick up something that we
[2:32:04] we read last time
[2:32:08] in closing.
[2:32:10] &gt;&gt; Last time when we here
[2:32:12] we we read the spoken word with the
[2:32:14] seven se
[2:32:19] I think it was paragraph 43
[2:32:23] if I recall well.
[2:32:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:32:26] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:32:28] This is what we read.
[2:32:31] It says, "You remember the little bitty
[2:32:34] messengers? They went east.
[2:32:40] The second messengers
[2:32:44] a little bit larger.
[2:32:47] They went east
[2:32:50] and then I looked.
[2:32:53] They was with me all the time.
[2:32:57] That was the first and the second pool.
[2:33:03] Now the third
[2:33:06] came from the west
[2:33:09] sweeping with great terrific speed.
[2:33:15] They picked me up
[2:33:19] &gt;&gt; that was coming back east
[2:33:23] with the mystery of the seven six
[2:33:29] just like it said in Junior Jackson
[2:33:34] that the Lord let me interpret
[2:33:40] on the inside of the pyramid
[2:33:44] there was a white stone
[2:33:46] that was wasn't written on.
[2:33:51] Let's stop there for a while. So, we we
[2:33:54] we want to pick up that
[2:33:56] remember the whole thing we said it's
[2:33:58] it's aligned.
[2:34:00] &gt;&gt; It started in the zodiac
[2:34:04] and then it came to the pyramid
[2:34:08] and it came in the word form.
[2:34:12] &gt;&gt; Now, the prophet
[2:34:15] H he
[2:34:18] had
[2:34:20] &gt;&gt; a duty
[2:34:22] you know like John
[2:34:26] John had a duty
[2:34:28] &gt;&gt; and his duty was that
[2:34:32] um you must introduce him
[2:34:35] that why he says I'm not that light
[2:34:39] &gt;&gt; he is coming
[2:34:42] &gt;&gt; but H for him to introduce Jesus,
[2:34:48] he had to see something first
[2:34:53] and he had to see light
[2:34:57] in a form of a dove
[2:35:01] because he says the one that sent me
[2:35:05] said to me
[2:35:08] on whom I see
[2:35:11] the spirit
[2:35:13] of God descending
[2:35:15] &gt;&gt; like a dove and remain on him that is
[2:35:19] him.
[2:35:21] &gt;&gt; So
[2:35:23] all along
[2:35:25] John
[2:35:26] &gt;&gt; did not know who he was going to
[2:35:27] introduce
[2:35:30] he was waiting for a spiritual
[2:35:32] &gt;&gt; sign.
[2:35:34] That spiritual sign
[2:35:37] came. It was God himself in a hollow of
[2:35:40] light.
[2:35:43] This hollow of light
[2:35:46] came down
[2:35:48] to identify Jesus.
[2:35:51] As much as it it identified the seventh
[2:35:53] man
[2:35:55] is the same hallow of life
[2:36:00] that John saw
[2:36:03] and he saw it remaining on him.
[2:36:06] And then when he introduced him,
[2:36:08] &gt;&gt; he said, "Behold the lamb of God."
[2:36:12] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:36:14] &gt;&gt; What an introduction.
[2:36:18] Only the spiritual people
[2:36:20] that were waiting for the lamp
[2:36:23] knew what was happening.
[2:36:26] Let me say something here.
[2:36:28] Maybe let's read Luke 23:45.
[2:36:40] Luke 3 verse 25
[2:36:42] &gt;&gt; 23 Luke 23 verse 45
[2:36:48] Luke 23
[2:36:51] verse 45
[2:36:54] and the sun was darkened and the veil of
[2:36:57] the temple was rent in the midst
[2:37:01] &gt;&gt; and 46
[2:37:03] &gt;&gt; and when Jesus Jesus had cried with a
[2:37:04] loud voice. He said, "Father, into thy
[2:37:07] hands I commit command my spirit."
[2:37:10] &gt;&gt; Okay. Now,
[2:37:12] &gt;&gt; if you take the book of Joshua
[2:37:15] &gt;&gt; chapter 10,
[2:37:17] &gt;&gt; that's the one that tells you,
[2:37:21] &gt;&gt; if you can reflect for us Joshua chapter
[2:37:23] 10 there
[2:37:26] &gt;&gt; on the screen.
[2:37:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:37:30] &gt;&gt; Yeah. It says, "And the sun stood still
[2:37:35] and the moon stayed
[2:37:38] until the people had avenged themselves
[2:37:40] upon their
[2:37:45] is not this written in the book of Jes."
[2:37:50] So the son stood still in the midst of
[2:37:52] heaven
[2:37:57] and has not
[2:38:00] and and hasted not to go down about a
[2:38:04] whole day.
[2:38:11] Joshua
[2:38:12] &gt;&gt; Joshua
[2:38:15] if if you read with the other verses
[2:38:17] there
[2:38:20] &gt;&gt; was in battle
[2:38:24] &gt;&gt; and he asked
[2:38:28] the son
[2:38:31] stop
[2:38:35] now I have said to view.
[2:38:38] In fact, the sun is not moving.
[2:38:43] What is moving
[2:38:45] is the planet.
[2:38:48] The earth
[2:38:50] rotates
[2:38:51] and revolves.
[2:38:54] The sun
[2:38:55] is on the throne.
[2:38:59] In the throne, you find four beasts,
[2:39:04] four beings.
[2:39:06] four four living creatures
[2:39:08] and the 24 elders
[2:39:10] round about the throne. I'm just trying
[2:39:13] to show you the spiritual setup and the
[2:39:16] natural setup
[2:39:18] that these things are aligned.
[2:39:22] &gt;&gt; Now
[2:39:26] the the throne
[2:39:28] &gt;&gt; is there
[2:39:31] you know the the pastor put it
[2:39:33] beautifully. He says one day
[2:39:36] Why there was silence in heaven?
[2:39:39] Why there was silence in heaven
[2:39:42] is because
[2:39:45] when he moved from the throne
[2:39:48] to take another throne
[2:39:50] in in heaven there was silence
[2:39:56] because in heaven
[2:39:58] there's always holy holy holy
[2:40:02] in the setup.
[2:40:05] That is why in Job, one of the questions
[2:40:09] is where were you when the sons when the
[2:40:12] stars of God
[2:40:15] &gt;&gt; sang together
[2:40:20] and
[2:40:21] the sons shouted for joy.
[2:40:28] &gt;&gt; So this singing together
[2:40:31] is the living creatures.
[2:40:34] They say holy, holy, holy, holy.
[2:40:37] &gt;&gt; Now um
[2:40:40] okay, let's leave the setup. Let me let
[2:40:42] me go to my point
[2:40:44] &gt;&gt; because we have to close.
[2:40:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:40:48] &gt;&gt; Um I spoke about Joshua
[2:40:51] &gt;&gt; that Joshua
[2:40:54] &gt;&gt; came
[2:40:55] and said son stop.
[2:40:58] According to science,
[2:41:02] the sun is not moving.
[2:41:05] It is the other planets that are moving.
[2:41:09] &gt;&gt; Right? Now, let me put it simple again.
[2:41:12] In our
[2:41:14] way of speaking,
[2:41:17] even when we talk,
[2:41:19] I will say to you before the sun sets,
[2:41:24] have you done one, two, three?
[2:41:27] Are we together? We say the sun is
[2:41:29] setting.
[2:41:30] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[2:41:32] &gt;&gt; Why? Is because
[2:41:35] we keep time
[2:41:38] by the sun.
[2:41:40] &gt;&gt; But in fact, it's not moving.
[2:41:44] It's only the earth that is moving.
[2:41:47] So in other words, I'm trying to say to
[2:41:48] you,
[2:41:50] when he said, "Son, stop."
[2:41:53] It meant the whole solar
[2:41:57] had to stop.
[2:42:03] &gt;&gt; And then he said, "Son, stop
[2:42:06] because it's naturally for a man
[2:42:10] to attribute time to the sun.
[2:42:15] That's what we do.
[2:42:18] &gt;&gt; Are we together?
[2:42:20] &gt;&gt; Do you agree with me that the earth is
[2:42:21] the one that is moving?
[2:42:25] Hallelujah. Amen. So it it is one man.
[2:42:30] &gt;&gt; What manner of men
[2:42:33] &gt;&gt; that is able to say son
[2:42:36] &gt;&gt; stop
[2:42:39] you interrupting
[2:42:42] with the solar system.
[2:42:45] You interrupting
[2:42:48] with the Milky Way galaxy.
[2:42:52] You are interrupting
[2:42:55] &gt;&gt; with the whole creation
[2:43:01] who can do that.
[2:43:04] &gt;&gt; It's not Joshua. Joshua,
[2:43:06] &gt;&gt; it's someone through Joshua.
[2:43:12] And he was able to do that once
[2:43:16] &gt;&gt; with Joshua.
[2:43:18] &gt;&gt; That's what one of the other verses
[2:43:19] says. It says there was no any other
[2:43:22] time
[2:43:23] that God
[2:43:25] unto a man
[2:43:28] God listened to a man like he listened
[2:43:31] to the request of Joshua.
[2:43:36] Joshua had a difficult request.
[2:43:40] And when and when he requested it
[2:43:43] He was in battle. He didn't He didn't
[2:43:46] even have time to pray.
[2:43:48] He just spoke it
[2:43:51] &gt;&gt; and it happened.
[2:43:55] &gt;&gt; It said about the whole day.
[2:44:00] Well, I don't know when it started.
[2:44:03] I don't know when it start. What time
[2:44:05] was it? But the verses
[2:44:09] the whole day
[2:44:11] we can say of what was remaining of the
[2:44:13] day
[2:44:17] job I mean
[2:44:18] &gt;&gt; Joshua
[2:44:19] &gt;&gt; Joshua
[2:44:20] &gt;&gt; was able
[2:44:22] &gt;&gt; to speak and it pleased God.
[2:44:27] Now that is why I've combined this
[2:44:30] with Luke 23.
[2:44:32] &gt;&gt; Luke 23. Luke 23 says
[2:44:35] &gt;&gt; Luke 23
[2:44:36] &gt;&gt; 45 Luke 23:45
[2:44:38] &gt;&gt; Amen. It says
[2:44:46] &gt;&gt; okay then 1344 it and it was about the
[2:44:50] sixth hour
[2:44:53] &gt;&gt; and there was darkness over all the
[2:44:54] earth until the 9th hour
[2:44:59] and the sun was darkened
[2:45:02] and the veil of the temple was rent in
[2:45:04] the midst
[2:45:07] and when Jesus had cried with a loud
[2:45:10] voice,
[2:45:13] "Father, into thy hands,
[2:45:16] &gt;&gt; I commend my spirit."
[2:45:21] Now here
[2:45:23] we find
[2:45:25] &gt;&gt; another
[2:45:27] Joshua was an astronaut astronaut
[2:45:30] &gt;&gt; uh because you know
[2:45:33] so here we find another
[2:45:36] &gt;&gt; which is the Lord Jesus Christ.
[2:45:40] So
[2:45:42] with him
[2:45:44] there came a time
[2:45:47] where the fulfillment
[2:45:50] of why he was here
[2:45:54] came to meet him.
[2:45:56] Remember he was introduced as the lamb
[2:46:00] going to be slain.
[2:46:02] That's why he's introduced as the lamb.
[2:46:04] It means he's going to the slaughter,
[2:46:09] right?
[2:46:10] to pay
[2:46:12] &gt;&gt; our price.
[2:46:17] &gt;&gt; So when that time comes
[2:46:22] &gt;&gt; and he was there,
[2:46:26] God
[2:46:27] also took another form.
[2:46:31] &gt;&gt; Actually the son
[2:46:34] &gt;&gt; the the suen
[2:46:40] This time there was no request.
[2:46:45] &gt;&gt; The son, the sun
[2:46:48] &gt;&gt; recognizes
[2:46:50] who is in charge.
[2:46:54] The sum
[2:46:56] was able to recognize
[2:46:59] my Lord is going for crucification.
[2:47:03] I'm going to put myself on him.
[2:47:08] And it says the sun darkened.
[2:47:12] &gt;&gt; So the son was mourning
[2:47:15] mourning that my lord having done
[2:47:19] nothing
[2:47:21] is been taken for crucification
[2:47:24] and the light had to
[2:47:28] honor
[2:47:30] the creator
[2:47:32] who became man.
[2:47:35] to say this one
[2:47:38] I cannot shine anymore.
[2:47:44] It was testifying
[2:47:47] that the one that you have is the one
[2:47:50] that created everything.
[2:47:55] They should have listened to Albert
[2:47:58] Einstein
[2:48:00] Einstein, one of the great scientist.
[2:48:04] who also studied the universe.
[2:48:08] And
[2:48:10] while studying
[2:48:12] he had a ambition
[2:48:18] to the sun.
[2:48:21] He wanted to reach the sun
[2:48:23] because he believed that
[2:48:26] if we can reach there, we can create
[2:48:28] wealths.
[2:48:31] He had a revelation that the power that
[2:48:34] I see here that is the source
[2:48:38] if I can go there I can create wealth
[2:48:42] but he realized that
[2:48:47] with the small paras that he had
[2:48:51] he realized that
[2:48:54] it's far
[2:48:56] &gt;&gt; then he said if God doesn't put these
[2:49:00] things in us.
[2:49:03] We have no answer.
[2:49:07] That was his conclusion.
[2:49:11] I'm also saying
[2:49:13] if God if we don't trust in God,
[2:49:17] we'll never have an answer.
[2:49:20] We must put our trust
[2:49:23] in God. God is the one that is
[2:49:27] responsible.
[2:49:29] He is the one that will put everything
[2:49:33] under the light.
[2:49:35] The search light.
[2:49:40] &gt;&gt; You know this this light must have the
[2:49:42] searching power.
[2:49:45] And when when it searches, it can find
[2:49:48] hidden things.
[2:49:50] And when it finds them, it brings them
[2:49:52] to the housetop.
[2:49:55] That's what the Bible says.
[2:49:58] &gt;&gt; Those things that are hidden will be
[2:50:00] brought to the rooftop.
[2:50:02] So that everyone can see.
[2:50:06] Ours is to keep our track
[2:50:10] where you are worshiping
[2:50:12] where you are placed. Just keep your tag
[2:50:18] &gt;&gt; and and and leave mine
[2:50:21] &gt;&gt; and leave his
[2:50:33] &gt;&gt; No.
[2:50:36] Um
[2:50:38] I was I was actually on that you see
[2:50:40] light has got very
[2:50:42] it's taking me here and there I was we
[2:50:45] were reading something
[2:50:48] that um quotation from the seven se
[2:50:54] in closing now
[2:50:56] &gt;&gt; where the
[2:50:58] prophet says
[2:51:02] &gt;&gt; um
[2:51:04] And the angels took me into the pyramid
[2:51:07] of themselves.
[2:51:11] The mystics of God known only to them.
[2:51:19] And now them was the messengers had to
[2:51:22] come to interpret.
[2:51:30] And now here's the thing. Now we are
[2:51:33] happy. you are all aligned
[2:51:37] and then
[2:51:41] Jesus came paid the price.
[2:51:45] Now we have the seventh man
[2:51:47] who says
[2:51:50] there is a mystery and he says there is
[2:51:53] a white rock
[2:51:55] that is not written
[2:51:58] and then he says
[2:52:01] this messengers that came
[2:52:03] They put me in the pyramid of themselves
[2:52:07] because everything now has to be
[2:52:08] aligned.
[2:52:11] You know, even the structure of a human
[2:52:12] being
[2:52:14] is that of a pyramid.
[2:52:17] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Now, uh these angels
[2:52:21] put them there
[2:52:24] to interpret
[2:52:26] &gt;&gt; to him
[2:52:29] the mystery.
[2:52:31] &gt;&gt; Are we together? Amen.
[2:52:33] &gt;&gt; Because you know
[2:52:36] um when you read about the sins,
[2:52:40] &gt;&gt; the seventh sin,
[2:52:43] there's always this problem that it's
[2:52:45] not revealed.
[2:52:48] Are we together? So now these angels
[2:52:52] were there
[2:52:54] to make it plain.
[2:53:00] H maybe let me read this
[2:53:04] and combine it with who is this
[2:53:07] mechisedc
[2:53:08] who is this melkisedc
[2:53:10] &gt;&gt; paragraph 22
[2:53:11] &gt;&gt; paragraph 22
[2:53:12] &gt;&gt; then I close I promise you
[2:53:17] &gt;&gt; I think they can just flesh it there the
[2:53:20] who is this
[2:53:20] &gt;&gt; meedc who is this mec
[2:53:23] &gt;&gt; yes there we go
[2:53:24] &gt;&gt; amen
[2:53:25] &gt;&gt; and listen friends God confirmed his
[2:53:26] word with signs and vindicates to prove
[2:53:29] that it's Right.
[2:53:36] The spoken words.
[2:53:40] Now remember that that light was in the
[2:53:43] cloud that day
[2:53:46] that gave the revelation.
[2:53:51] Then he says, "My little girl was
[2:53:52] telling me
[2:53:56] Sarah Sarah here.
[2:54:00] Now let me explain this one quick.
[2:54:03] It was that cloud
[2:54:06] that came
[2:54:08] um he says there was a light
[2:54:12] in that cloud.
[2:54:14] Are we together? So he says um my little
[2:54:18] daughter
[2:54:20] at school they even released them
[2:54:25] &gt;&gt; as they were as they were seeing.
[2:54:28] It was a cloudless day.
[2:54:32] But there was just this one cloud
[2:54:35] just going up and down like this.
[2:54:38] And then they looked at this cloud. They
[2:54:40] could see that this is something else.
[2:54:43] &gt;&gt; Yes, that is the cloud.
[2:54:46] Then
[2:54:47] even the teacher
[2:54:50] Sarah's teacher
[2:54:52] dismissed the class.
[2:54:57] In my time when they dismissed us,
[2:55:00] &gt;&gt; it was only when it was snowing.
[2:55:03] But this day it was a blessed dismissal
[2:55:09] because they were seeing something
[2:55:12] that is an answer to humankind.
[2:55:16] A pyramid of angels
[2:55:20] putting a man in itself.
[2:55:29] Maybe let me just read quickly 5
[2:55:31] minutes.
[2:55:34] It says here
[2:55:37] that school there in Arizona was looking
[2:55:39] up
[2:55:41] on the clouded sky
[2:55:44] and seeing this cloud mysteriously in
[2:55:46] that mountain
[2:55:50] going up and down with an ember fire
[2:55:53] burning in it.
[2:55:56] The teacher dismissed the class
[2:56:00] and brought them out front and said,
[2:56:03] "Did you ever see anything like that?
[2:56:07] Look the way that's there."
[2:56:10] So, you can see that it's it's God
[2:56:13] showing that this is the supernatural
[2:56:16] there's a light up there. Then it says
[2:56:20] here, remember that's the same ember
[2:56:24] light
[2:56:25] that's on the rock.
[2:56:28] So it's the same God,
[2:56:31] same revelation.
[2:56:35] Tell them to do this.
[2:56:38] So what what I wanted to bring here is
[2:56:41] that it is the same God
[2:56:46] that God said in the beginning.
[2:56:50] I mean Moses said in the beginning
[2:56:54] said let us create
[2:56:56] that same God became a hallow of light
[2:57:01] and and the prophet here he calls it an
[2:57:05] ember light on the rock
[2:57:09] because now this remember this rock is
[2:57:10] not written
[2:57:13] but it needs to be interpreted.
[2:57:16] Have you seen such a thing? people
[2:57:18] interested in a rock that does not have
[2:57:20] a life.
[2:57:24] That tells you
[2:57:27] there is something
[2:57:29] that this these angels had to utter
[2:57:33] for that for that utterance to happen
[2:57:36] they had to give brother Brham
[2:57:39] a revelation.
[2:57:41] &gt;&gt; Then once he has a revelation
[2:57:44] because that's what it says. So it's the
[2:57:45] same God same revelation.
[2:57:48] So once he picks up the revelation
[2:57:51] and then it means
[2:57:54] now he has seen the writing on the rock.
[2:58:00] It's a rock without the lighting.
[2:58:03] But when the light comes,
[2:58:06] you know, like Moses when he went up the
[2:58:08] mountain. He took two table stones.
[2:58:11] God, writing through fire
[2:58:15] through light, he had to write the ten
[2:58:17] commandments.
[2:58:19] Those stones were not written. But when
[2:58:22] he came back from the mountain, there
[2:58:26] was a writing.
[2:58:28] Now,
[2:58:30] brotherham,
[2:58:31] &gt;&gt; when he came out
[2:58:34] from that constellation
[2:58:36] of angels,
[2:58:41] &gt;&gt; he came with the interpretation,
[2:58:45] first revelation,
[2:58:48] second,
[2:58:49] then when he comes to interpret, he's
[2:58:52] interpreting us.
[2:58:54] God bless you.
[2:59:04] Thank you so much
[2:59:07] um for being such a good audience.
[2:59:12] It is through your prayers
[2:59:15] that you are able to have this
[2:59:16] environment
[2:59:19] and may the good lord.
[2:59:23] May he strengthen us
[2:59:26] as a church
[2:59:28] that we may be able
[2:59:31] when they look down on us,
[2:59:34] they can be proud to say this is what we
[2:59:37] taught them.
[2:59:44] So let me hand over to you. Maybe you
[2:59:47] can just um say a song and um I give to
[2:59:53] our MC.
[2:59:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. God bless you.

[3:03:19] &gt;&gt; and we are happy.
[3:03:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:03:27] &gt;&gt; As I'm going to request my elder there
[3:03:33] &gt;&gt; just to come and pray for us
[3:03:36] after the word.
[3:03:39] It reminds me this song that sings
[3:03:43] &gt;&gt; when I remember
[3:03:47] the Lord has done
[3:04:01] &gt;&gt; when I remember
[3:04:03] when I
[3:04:11] I will I will never
[3:04:20] when I remember
[3:04:24] when I
[3:04:28] was the Lord.
[3:04:35] I will never forget
[3:04:39] anymore.
[3:04:41] &gt;&gt; I will never go back anymore.
[3:04:49] Why the Lord
[3:04:51] is
[3:04:53] I will never.
[3:05:00] &gt;&gt; They say no no no no no no no no no.
[3:05:21] No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[3:05:24] no, no.
[3:05:32] Glor,
[3:05:47] mighty God,
[3:05:50] the greatest one
[3:05:53] this morning, Lord Almighty,
[3:05:56] each and every one of us
[3:05:59] when we woke up.
[3:06:02] We kneel down and say, "Father,
[3:06:06] we are going to a meeting.
[3:06:09] We are going to a service
[3:06:12] to hear your word."
[3:06:15] &gt;&gt; Therefore, Lord, after that word,
[3:06:19] we with our heads bowed,
[3:06:22] we would like to thank you, Father.
[3:06:25] You gave us a substance
[3:06:28] &gt;&gt; of things that we are hoping for.
[3:06:33] &gt;&gt; You gave us an evidence, Lord Almighty.
[3:06:38] Of the word, Lord Almighty,
[3:06:42] that was the one that created us.
[3:06:46] We like to thank you, Father, for
[3:06:48] honoring us as we have honored thee.
[3:06:53] There was a day when your son said,
[3:06:57] "Father,
[3:07:00] praying Lord," in the book of John 17,
[3:07:04] he said, "Glorify me
[3:07:08] so that I could glorify thee, Lord."
[3:07:11] And today, Father,
[3:07:14] now that you have glorified us,
[3:07:17] we give that glory back to thee, Lord.
[3:07:20] Amen.
[3:07:21] &gt;&gt; Because thou knew better than us.
[3:07:25] &gt;&gt; You knew us, Lord, before the foundation
[3:07:27] of the world.
[3:07:30] &gt;&gt; And you knew the Lord Almighty that a
[3:07:33] day like this will come.
[3:07:36] And father, you know
[3:07:38] when this day comes, how should we
[3:07:42] behave and how should we react.
[3:07:46] We like to thank you father for the
[3:07:49] mercy and grace that you have done onto
[3:07:51] our life especially lord almighty
[3:07:55] the word that is relevant
[3:07:59] &gt;&gt; to our time.
[3:08:01] Thank you father.
[3:08:04] Bless our brother here, Meti
[3:08:08] for standing behind this pullpit
[3:08:11] and Lord Almighty
[3:08:13] preaching to us through your inspiration
[3:08:17] and through your anointing.
[3:08:21] Bless this church Lord Almighty
[3:08:24] that you open Lord Almighty a ground and
[3:08:27] open up a heart that could receive your
[3:08:31] word. Lord,
[3:08:33] &gt;&gt; there was a time where the Pharisees,
[3:08:35] the Sadducees, the scribes
[3:08:38] wanted to kill you because you said
[3:08:43] you were there before Abraham was.
[3:08:47] and gracious heavenly father,
[3:08:50] here we are this day, Father,
[3:08:53] being recognized as the seed of Abraham,
[3:08:56] Lord,
[3:08:57] &gt;&gt; standing here, Lord Almighty, opening
[3:08:59] our hearts,
[3:09:02] you said to them, you want to kill me
[3:09:05] because my word has got no place in your
[3:09:09] heart.
[3:09:11] Father, we are so thankful because your
[3:09:14] word has got a place, Lord Almighty, in
[3:09:17] our hearts. Therefore, bless your
[3:09:20] church, Lord. Bless everybody
[3:09:24] that is under this roof, Lord Almighty,
[3:09:28] as they'll be going out. Bless them,
[3:09:31] Lord Almighty. Sanctify them.
[3:09:34] &gt;&gt; Give them, Lord Almighty, the request of
[3:09:36] their hearts.
[3:09:37] &gt;&gt; In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, we
[3:09:40] pray. Amen.
[3:09:48] &gt;&gt; As we prepare for the baptism, our
[3:09:51] brother will just lead us.
[3:09:54] God bless you.
[3:10:07] with again.

[3:12:27] to heaven

[3:12:50] This is a home of heaven.
[3:12:57] Heaven
[3:13:09] Yeah.

[3:14:57] Who are
[3:15:07] we?
[3:15:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:15:14] Glory, glory, glory.
[3:15:18] At this time, basal, let me just request
[3:15:21] our elder just to come and pray for us
[3:15:24] shortly.
[3:15:26] before we go to the wait. Amen. And then
[3:15:29] our brother will come with a word. God
[3:15:32] bless you. Amen.
[3:15:37] Can we bow our heads, dear heavenly
[3:15:40] father,
[3:15:42] we glorify your name. We honor you. We
[3:15:44] salute you for the great word that spoke
[3:15:48] we spoke to us this afternoon.
[3:15:52] Father, we come to you with this great
[3:15:54] service
[3:15:55] through the mouth of the prophet. You
[3:15:58] taught us that is so important to be
[3:16:00] baptized
[3:16:01] is for us to repent and be baptized in
[3:16:04] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Here
[3:16:07] we are today fulfilling the very same
[3:16:09] scriptures that you spoke since in the
[3:16:13] beginning through the pillar of fire
[3:16:15] that led the children of Israel when
[3:16:18] they went out from Egypt to the promised
[3:16:20] land. There was that pillar of light,
[3:16:22] Lord, the supernatural light. And your
[3:16:26] word says all Israel were baptized under
[3:16:30] that cloud.
[3:16:32] And you told Moses that they must not
[3:16:35] cry, but they must speak.
[3:16:38] That Moses can speak the word and
[3:16:40] they'll cross over. And the Bible says
[3:16:43] they were all baptized in that pillar of
[3:16:46] fire. They were baptized in that Red
[3:16:49] Sea. And that was typing the baptismal
[3:16:53] of what we have today.
[3:16:55] John saw that
[3:16:58] dove, that spirit of God coming upon
[3:17:01] Jesus
[3:17:03] and he said, "Let us fulfill all
[3:17:06] righteousness." John was worthy to
[3:17:10] baptize Jesus because he was going to be
[3:17:12] a sacrificial lamb. and in the last
[3:17:16] days, Father, you make a way for us as
[3:17:19] your children, that each and every one
[3:17:21] of us who repents and be baptized, you
[3:17:24] will come in, Father. Here are the souls
[3:17:27] that are standing before us. They've
[3:17:29] received your word, Lord. They are now
[3:17:32] identifying themselves with thee. As
[3:17:35] they are going in to be baptized
[3:17:36] together with those brothers, we'll be
[3:17:39] baptizing them. Lord, we believe that
[3:17:42] the same God who created all heaven and
[3:17:44] earth will come inside them, Lord, to
[3:17:48] make them sons and daughters of the
[3:17:49] living God because they were children of
[3:17:51] God before the foundation of the world.
[3:17:54] Today, they are standing here to
[3:17:56] identify themselves with the word that
[3:17:59] was delivered in this last days. Bless
[3:18:01] each and each and everything that's
[3:18:03] going to be done right now in the mighty
[3:18:04] name of our Lord and Savior Jesus
[3:18:06] Christ. Amen. Acts
[3:18:14] chapter 2 from verse 36-39.
[3:18:18] Therefore let all the house of Israel
[3:18:20] know assuredly that God hath made that
[3:18:23] same Jesus whom he have crucified both
[3:18:26] Lord and Christ. Now when they heard
[3:18:29] this, they were pricricked in their
[3:18:31] heart and said unto Peter and to the
[3:18:33] rest of the apostles, "Men and brethren,
[3:18:36] what shall we do?" Then Peter said unto
[3:18:39] them, "Repent and be baptized, every one
[3:18:42] of you, in the name of Jesus Christ, for
[3:18:44] the remission of sins, and ye shall
[3:18:47] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. For
[3:18:50] the promise is unto you and to your
[3:18:52] children, and to all that are a far off,
[3:18:55] even as many as the Lord our God shall
[3:18:58] call.
[3:19:14] All
[3:19:25] &gt;&gt; when
[3:19:29] go
[3:19:32] true to love.
[3:19:33] &gt;&gt; Oh.
[3:19:41] foreign
[3:20:02] uses
[3:20:10] glory.
[3:20:14] There is
[3:20:19] peace.
[3:20:41] I love
[3:20:55] &gt;&gt; when
[3:20:58] true
[3:21:01] to
[3:21:06] &gt;&gt; not
[3:21:10] call.
[3:21:19] &gt;&gt; We'll request our preacher that the Lord
[3:21:21] touch us to come and pray. God bless
[3:21:24] you.
[3:21:27] &gt;&gt; Let us pray.
[3:21:31] Dear heavenly father, once more lord we
[3:21:34] are so grateful and thankful
[3:21:38] that you called yet another souls
[3:21:44] because the time is drawing near
[3:21:48] that we will be no more in this earth.
[3:21:51] Father,
[3:21:53] but you are calling one by one those
[3:21:57] that belong to you.
[3:21:59] Heavenly Father, it is a waterway
[3:22:02] as we have seen before
[3:22:06] you went to Calvary. You also had to be
[3:22:08] baptized by John. Here the two father
[3:22:12] they also take the same step of
[3:22:15] realizing
[3:22:18] that it is a waterway indeed.
[3:22:21] We ask father that uh from henceforth
[3:22:25] be with them. We know the devil is not
[3:22:29] happy and he will come and entice them
[3:22:34] with the things of this world.
[3:22:37] We know that the things of this world
[3:22:39] look beautiful
[3:22:41] to a natural eye. But father give them
[3:22:44] the spiritual eye that they may
[3:22:47] appreciate you more than the world.
[3:22:50] Heavenly father it's such a great price
[3:22:52] that you have paid and we are grateful
[3:22:54] that the young are coming.
[3:22:57] Father we ask that you bless the service
[3:23:00] that has been rendered of baptism and
[3:23:04] father your children that came also just
[3:23:08] to be blessed by you through your word.
[3:23:10] Father uh continue to be with us and
[3:23:15] guide us as we are pilgrims in this
[3:23:19] world. Really father we ask all these
[3:23:21] things knowing that you are the one that
[3:23:24] have overcome
[3:23:26] and you bought your church
[3:23:29] through your blood and father we are
[3:23:31] grateful to apply that blood and we we
[3:23:34] say apply it to the two souls as well.
[3:23:36] Heavenly Father, we ask all these things
[3:23:38] believing in the wonderful name of our
[3:23:40] Lord and Savior Jesus Christ with
[3:23:42] thanksgiving. Amen. And amen.
[3:24:02] willing.
