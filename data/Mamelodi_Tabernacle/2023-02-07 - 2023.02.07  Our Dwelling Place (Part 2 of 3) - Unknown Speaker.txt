TRANSCRIPT
========================================
is now in the heart of men so if I want to go to get to the ark I must find a [Music] man because the AR he says the is in the heart of is in the heart of men the Throne of God is in the heart of the pill of fire amen so in the last days God appeared in different ways but in the last days he has put all those things in Amen in the old days you know all things were in Adam and and sin sin caused him to lose so things were now [Music] outside and God gave gave them laws yeah yeah amen am ordinances until in Hebrew chapter 8 God says there Paul quot that God said now I will make a New Covenant the New Covenant he says I will put them in them men because men had to keep them they were without so God second Covenant god's second Covenant is to put those things inside now we have the first which is the seven Church ages things are outside the pill of fire is outside you see things outside but the seven SE a New Covenant that's when God puts all this those things inside and now today we don't go around looking for the P of fire that P of fire the prophet says is now in amen because we are the last men standing now we are the last amen so now all things are now inside there's no other Prophet coming coming so this is what theeven things were so the that book so now the people these days they have to turn to the bride the book is the bride you the book spoken original the prophet says this is now the secret the way now the word is not Aon the word is Theos the word is now God we were looking at this the other day seven Church ages it was the word of God alloted to ages that age had this part of the of the until seven amen now when it comes to seven it's no longer a part of the word to a church is the prophet says now the secret now is the word not to a church age word in the Bri because I will still repeat that [Music] manifestation the last thing is in the briad [Applause] now I can read something again here brother say here when Abram and sah when they were looking for a son for the coming [Music] son for 25 years years they had looked for it now he says now they were at the end of The Journey God appeared to them in many forms as he has through the church ages you see he just appeared in many forms amen you know with Elisha let's go back to Elisha El experienced many things with elij but when they reach over he received the M from elij all right now the prophet says at the end of The Journey God appeared to them in many forms like through as he has Through the Ages lights and so forth as he spoke to Abraham by Voices and before the coming son could arrive amen amen and then he changed their bodies and sah immediately after this so he changed so they could receive the son now the prophet referring to the change of the body to us today the prophet he says it's another man in [Applause] you says the New Life Starts from that man in Amen to bring the son that is the change we are already changing we come to that let's read this one here so now the last sign that they got before the son arrived was Jehovah talken to them in the form of a man that is the last [Music] sign the last thing the last sign is speaking to them in the form of man as you see the seven was the last sign when God came down and spoke to us in the form of that is the last sign amen okay now that show it shows that all this time God was coming to one place now now let's continue as we look at this things I love them because they make me to see myself they make me to see myself now H we will I I will go down here the thing is it comes down to a manifestation as brother says the whole world the whole world is waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God people had come for many many years the prophet says the prophet says yeah that is good I also I do the same thing but if that don't come to a manifestation then like I'm saying to you the prophet said this amen amen so I'm informing you that the prophet said this but now what the people are expecting now is not what the prophet said it is the fulfill [Music] speaks says God gave him a Ministry for you to fulfill the word of God and that's why in the book spoken is the original SE says God has a little bride like Mary and he says through shall be shall the shall be a fulfillment of the word of God all that God has promised in his word be fulfilled in this little bride of Christ because brother says with the Lord Jesus Christ we don't see all things fulfill because part of that weight is the pride now he say the word prod the S which is Jesus Christ the prod of the word but it was not yet a complete because part of that is the Bri now that's why he had to send to come for the bride and that's why say now the the secret before the foundation of the world is now in the you see now and he says it is because with Jesus Christ he played one part of each and the bride has to fulfill the other part Masterpiece messenger he also came and at the end of it all he says I must he must increase that means he must get married it is no good that he should be alone am amen amen that's why God made him to sleep on the cross to take the woman out of saw that it is no good his son remains alone amen because in that condition he cannot increase he could not reprod reproduce so he must have a wife so at the end of time then he sends out the seventh Messenger to choose a wife for his son among the wom that means among the churches bring a woman a Virg for Christ now he says this woman because the groom the bridegroom is is the word now the must be the word amen so the word will has come to Mar the word so that's why it was supposed to to be fulfilled in the bride to bring wife for the Lord now I was reading to you from the book Fellowship by Redemption the place he says I never believed that heaven was a place where there is a bunch of [Music] buildings I have never believed that a supernatural being would have to live in a leral house I believe that when Jesus spoke in the Book of John in my father's houses many mentions he meant a body the mentions in in my in his father's house is the bodies he said I'm going to prepare that place because you know what when he died the Bible tells us that the graves were opened and and the bodies of many Saints came for amen and you know they they were that cloud that took him away the Saints the Saints the Believers those who died when he was on the cross you know the Bible says he cried out and there was a power of God that came and and opened the veil in the temple and went down to open the graves it was the souls brother says the spirits of those who went before and those now in in those days there were a there was a place where the dead were put in or placed that was Paradise now this paradise the Lord Jesus says both the righteous and the unrighteous went to that place but there was a gulf between the righteous on this sideous on the other side now when he died and he rose again he he he there was an what do you call now immigration those who were there in the in the Fifth Dimension he he they migrated to the six Dimension is that right so that's why he says I am going to prepare a place for you because now he had he was going to prepare now the sixth Dimension there was a migration of the people from The Fifth Dimension from from Paradise to the six Dimension amen amen so he says now that's why he says I'm going to prepare you a place so that where I am you may be also that's why now you are where he is you are where he is and he is where you are that is what happened in the last days amen and say man and God came from the same place yeah they they came from the same place so if they are from the same place then today they live in the same place because they are together again the seven put and God together again the seven is the SE so the thir po all this time the prophet had some Visions he healed the sick he he he did many miracles but when it comes to the third pool he says I will meet you in there amen but all this time he saw Vision he did that and that but the thir says I will meet you in there amen am so it's something greater than what he's being seeing or [Music] performing because he says now I will meet you in there now this is greater than a vis amen okay now as I'm looking at this I I believe when Jesus spoke of a place he spoke of a Dwelling Place amen for the Bible says when our be dissolved we have another now it's not just a tabernacle it's a place all right so we can read on and on and on that is in another dimension but I'm I I just want to go back to where I have read here okay now if I read in another book now the place he meant he refers to [Music] your you know brother says in the book um there was one brother he was Disturbed and say you could BR many times more than you you could amen okay now here we are with the members of the um in who is this now he says and you byass your you know before I go there he says look when he was first when when he was first made Adam he was made two people together he was made both male and female men was the Bible said he was God made men male and female created him now when men were separated from the and put in the flesh all right maybe I can try something here man was put when he was put in the then he was made flesh I mean when he was separated amen now I know the pastors teach of these things I don't know if you can see this but if we can we come down the stages yeah uh you know French yes spirit in French Spirit the in Fr funny ah God bless you it is still funny so we will post speak French now the third is men okay okay now God of spirit j a spirit and the Bible says says God is a spirit with a capital S and here me I am a spirit with small s amen and if you come down here it's he says the logos now Theos is the entire word of God and here I am a he he is a spirit I'm a spirit and he became Theos I'm the now logos is is the whole word of godos which means that you are part of Theos now that's why we read the in the word says in the beginning was the word which is the is Christ and is the word that's Theos now the Bible says John one begin was the was with God was God right and we always quote down to verse 16 and the Bible says and there was a man s from God a man that is sent by God is Not Like a Man sent from God because many are sent but few are chosen now the prophet says we bypass this from the spirit to being a man God made us to bypass our in order to be [Music] tested as human beings all right now because we bypass that that's why you have a hunger and longing in you because you you you you are a [Music] reflection now now if we were [Music] in we wouldn't have come to be tested if Jesus remained a spirit he couldn't die and we couldn't be tested so God had to bring the thing or everything down in order to become the Healer the Redeemer and all that now before we close here's the mystery of it now here we become Soul a living Soul now if you read page 80 if I read page 80 of the book of my uh Hebrew [Music] book The Prophet says to me this the soul of man was that that means as a predestinated being your soul here is a reflector of this that's why now throughout the the the seven Church ages your soul is [Music] active but when the seals were open your is active because here is time with seven Church ages is time but Seven Seals is beyond time [Music] seven are Beyond they can only be picked up by only can pick up the seals the revelation of the seven SE now I'm not talking about the seven in the book which anybody can read and say the first SE is right we are talking about the revelation of [Music] it the revelation of it is a man now the people after reading they come to men you the Jews Pharisees priest they always come to the synagogue with the scrs like this amen amen and here comes Jesus now Jesus is the Fulfillment of what is in their SC [Music] they said to him you make yourself God now look it will take somebody with a [Music] reflection comes now now now you can imagine when she saw the Lord Jesus you know she was trying to cover herself you know she was a prostitute and trying to pull down and all [Music] that amen because inside of that when Jesus was expressed before the the Pharisees they call him the king of the Demons he says it is because they had nothing in them to make a contact it is just like if you phone somebody without there's no contact so he end this woman because she had a representation little little Stone she came there and and of course she was ashamed of herself trying to cover herself but she said while while trembling before the Lord I perceive you are a prophet amen why because she made a cont she was not just a church [Music] member [Music] representation she should make cont
