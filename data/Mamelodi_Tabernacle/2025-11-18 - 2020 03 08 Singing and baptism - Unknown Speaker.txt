We like to thank you father that you always kept on amazing us [music] &gt;&gt; because that seven sea lord that has been revealed to us it keep on shooting every time. Whenever as we are looking Lord it shoots again. [music] &gt;&gt; Whenever we are looking Lord it shoots again and reveals &gt;&gt; and as it reveals oh Lord it becomes a mystery. to the kingdom of the darkness. &gt;&gt; It becomes my father a mystery which cannot be interpreted &gt;&gt; to those who are not even predestinated Lord. Father, this morning we like to thank you as we come as we came from different places, oh Lord, coming to thee. And some of us, oh Lord, they came because Lord, they've got uh their situations where they need [music] the addressing Lord this morning so that they can have the solution. &gt;&gt; And Father, we thank you that this is the house of Abraham. It is the house of solutions, Lord. And father, we thank you, Father, that as we are gathered here, Lord, I know that even the enemy is not happy. As long as the sons of God are gathering, oh Lord, &gt;&gt; the enemy is not happy. But Father, we like to stand against the sons of the devil this morning again, Lord. &gt;&gt; Because Father, we thank you that the word, your word is so powerful. And father we thank you that even our pastor who's going to be with us this morning oh Lord that salt that word which was [music] with brother Brennham our prophet is with him also father and we thank you that Lord even yesterday when he was preaching Lord in Albaton he mentioned something father profound when he said Lord even that thief Lord who was with Christ on the cross father He said, "Oh God, have mercy on me and remember me in your kingdom." Now the pastor says that how did the thief know that Jesus is a kingdom? Because he was a thief. But father we thank you that it was because the thief was predestinated. And father we thank you also the woman of Samaria. Father, she was also predestinated. [music] She said, "I know that the Messiah is coming." Father, we thank you this morning, oh Lord, that you never leave us. You'll never forsake us. Oh Lord, you are always with us. Father, you hold us by your hand. And we thank you this morning. Oh Lord, as we are gathered into this place, Father, we've got our brothers leading us with songs. Oh Lord, we we pray that you Lord, you you you hide him, Father, under your wings, as we continue, Father, praising you this morning, oh Lord, we pray, Father, for all the tithing. We pray all the offerings that are still coming, oh Lord. And also, Father, we pray for those who are sick this morning. In the mighty name of the Lord Jesus, we know that father through your word father they are going to be healed because your word it is you yourself it is the your word is Christ himself. Your word is that logos oh lord and when it is revealed to us father every knee shall bow and every tongue shall confess that you are the only god and there's no other in the mighty name of Jesus. Father when the higher power comes in, when the higher kingdom comes in, the lesser kingdom has to vacate the place. And that is why we are praying this morning that the lesser kingdom must vacate the place right now in the mighty name of the Lord [music] Jesus. You devil, you are not invited into this place. You are not needed into this place. But we pray that in the name of Jesus, Lord is going to reveal himself this morning. And when he reveal himself this morning, that word which is the salt of the Lord is going to stay to each and one of us into into our hearts. Father, we thank you Lord and we bless you as we give you the glory. We pray father also for our pastor still going to come. Lord, I know that the enemy is planning also. He's got other plans, Father, for the word, but we destroy them now because, Father, already we have won before the word comes. And father, we thank you that we are more than conquerors. We are victors. Oh Lord, the Bible says, Lord, we don't have to fear anything because father, we are not alone, but we are coming with you. We thank you, Father.
