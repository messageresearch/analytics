own father our hearts were really broken the government wouldn't allow to release him even when he Wasing he's going to bury his father so when he came back and then he changed the school he attended went to another school before but before he could change the school he came with the message of the hour hallelujah amen and then he said to me don't you want to be baptized he used to attend an Apostolic church I think maybe even the family members don't know that part I said to him I can be baptized but to me I didn't even think that he's referring to baptism at the apostolic church and I didn't even ask him at which church when he asked me don't you want to be baptized I realize what he saying is different from Apostolic church it's different from zcc church and I said to him I want to be baptized hallelujah amen and then 1981 then I was baptized in 1981 we were together with thank you also so I was baptized there so we were on an isolated area we were listening to the service through a tape and will even take out offering those offerings will then buy a battery for the radio or the tape we're [Applause] using the message was serious just showing the way hallelujah amen and I grew up that way until I completed my secondary school when I then went to ter that's when the tape meeting stopped and he's the one who taught me there so he brought me up he's my father brother to my father they were born in their family being nine they have two sisters ahead of and then it was my uncle and then my father and then my other uncle and then the other Uncle the father to the brother who welcom and then him he's the ninth one amen amen and then so he brought me up I don't remember a time when we disagreed I will enjoy him he won't be angry at [Music] you but he once beat me we were heading cattles but some how we got some C lost and he found me there and gave me a good beating and then and then what really saved me is that I that is the only time I remember when he gave me a good but all of all of the timey and always I remember him scri Philippians chter 2 let nothing let nothing be done through stri nothing should be done through St amen yes amen in they usually say that my brother here was very humble amen [Music] amen even when we had the family meetings I will always wish that he shouldn't be absent amen amen because I know where there's somebody who's arent this brother will come and put him to place through his humility [Music] so I called him a brother even though he was my uncle I grew up calling him brother and he didn't dispute that amen amen so God has really helped us to give us people like him so we might but in the family will just say we have lost because of the illness that was we thought that he would be fine and be healed when he was sick at the hospital to more when they were saying he's critical was thinking of Florence [Music] gorence same God who once healed that woman even to us when we need hope he can rise him up even when they report that the condition is not Florence Florence the Lord will also ra the same one we look at what God Amen I believe the family let us be comforted and then he's in the better place

have here just to go to the word of God because uh uh that's actually where he was dedicated to thank you amen uh I would like us to Bow our heads first and I let's pray gracious Lord It's again this evening we know you Lord Almighty as the light of both the day and the night amen there was a time where there was Darkness on this Earth the first thing that you created was the light and that light is even still shining in our hearts God Amen we are here Lord Almighty through your will you've been with us Lord all the way until we reach this destination the last thing gracious Lord that we going to present is to hear thee father uh consoling us amen of the occasion that has occurred amen and you'll be the one Lord Almighty who will bring the words of wisdom knowledge and understanding amen we thank you Father as we are going to open the word we pray Lord that may you guide us through father in the precious name of our Lord Jesus Christ I would like to thank you amen amen uh I would like us to read from the book of John I IID like to read from verse 61 up to 63 John chapter 6 6: 61 up to 63 when Jesus knew in himself that his disciples murmured at it he said unto them do this offend you what and if you shall see the son of man Ascend up where he was before it it is a spirit that quickeneth the flesh profiteth nothing the words that I speak unto you they are spirits and they are life Hallelujah okay we may be seated uh it's a memorial service it's a service that is uh in memory with what has occurred departure of our beloved brother uh the paper that he just given me it says that we can push up to 9:00 but I don't think I'll push up will okay so uh our brother uh T is well known in our service for his dedication and for his hard working you all know him now that he has Departed the family and the church uh see it a good that we should meet and just say something about him as the friends and the families were saying something about him believer have rendered some musical items the last part now is that we uh just go to the we and read the scripture and hear what the Lord has to say to [Music] uh I want to speak about the resurrection of Life the the Bible say our Lord Jesus Christ once said I am the bread of life and there was a time where he took bread and gave them and said eat this uh referring to the bread as his flesh and he gave them wine and he said they should drink that was referring to his Spirit but he never explain those things and there was a time where our great great grandfather Adam for the title de so after he forf the title it was not lost it went back to God himself that titled it and then it it it was our inheritance so God took it back to himself because his son fated it and the devil wanted it so then we were now given a task our task was that now we should proclaim a life that is worthy that we can receive back that title de that is our inheritance and that that that title did in order that we should get it back we need to fight so it's only for those that will win in that [Music] fight because there are two forces that is the force of our beloved God and the force of the devil the devil wants that title and then God has got that title but he want to give it to us but we have to be worthy that is why now we are the bride which is worthy to receive that so now God himself became the intercessor he became our mediator so now being the mediator he is the one that saw that we are worthy to receive the ti so now in that title de There Is No Death no it's only life that's why when death came it was just darkness but now we speaking about the resurrection of life it was life in the Garden of Eden but when death came it seems to be a doom that is why now we are believers we believe the word of God now the script uh the word of God or the Bible itself is the word of God there was a time I want to read the scripture before I come to this one it's in in in in verse 29 in the same chapter more verse 29 chapter 6 can you read it for us my brother just start from verse 28 then said they unto him what shall we do that we might work the works of God yeah now now these people they were asking our Lord Jesus Christ they said to him because he started by saying unto them labor not for the meat which in verse 27 labor not for the meat which perishes in other words when when you live you don't live uh that at the end of your life it should be a life that perished when you leave you should know that now after you your your spirit has gone out of this body then you should be proud of yourself that the separation of your body your spirit it's not a lost it's not death you should know where your spirit goes and you should know where your soul goes but it is the spirit that Quicken are we together the spirit Quicken so now when you are alive you should know that that and you should feel supernaturally that you are quickened you don't meditate about death you meditate about life after death there is life after death there's there's your inheritance there are different bodies right and there are different dispensations and there are different places our Lord Jesus Christ used to get in and out of different dispensations and you to go into different bodies one day he met his disciples they were going to to ous then he spoke to them in another body they could not see [Music] him right he went down with them preaching the word unto them on and on and on until they reach their destination after reaching their destination then he exposed himself and then they saw him then he vanished he get to another body his disciples were hidden somewhere were hiding somewhere door locked and then he just came in and said peace be with you and then they said no this this is a ghost he said give me fish and bread then he ate and said a fish can't eat I mean a ghost can't eat how did he get through that door because it was locked now he will he will will go into different dimensions now to show us that there are certain dispensations and there are certain Dimensions at times he will walk upon the sea you don't walk upon water you swim he will walk upon water what type of a body that will walk upon water that is just to tell you that life here is a temporary life there are greater things Beyond Death this body actually is delaying us this place here called Earth is delaying us we've got a better place so those are the things that we need to meditate about we've got a better place we've got a better father we've got a better Dimension that's what we need to H meditate about now our brother he's been in the service on every weekend never miss now it's the only time where he said I am now in a better place I wish that that's that's our place then now we read the scripture again it says uh I think it's chapter 6 yes verse 29 yes yes it says here okay they were saying to him he said no le not for the verse 27 labor not for the meat which perishes but for the meat which enure it un everlasting life which is which the son of man shall give unto you the son of man shall give you life that enure it everlasting life for him God has sealed the son of man it's a person who God is in him our Lord Jesus Christ it was Jesus who came in a bodily form and when God descended he descended in the form of a spirit because God is a spirit they that worship Him should worship Him in truth and in spirit or in spirit and Truth Now when he was in Jesus he was the son of man now the Bible here says labor not for the food or the meat which perishes don't waste your time about something that you're going to lose don't waste your time living here on Earth knowing exactly that you don't know where you going you have to be sure that when you go where are you going right you don't have to guess you don't have to no you have to be sure where is your soul going because a being is in a three-fold manner the only thing that you know is that your body will get into the grave but what about the destination of your spirit what about the destination of your soul that's the thing that you need to so now that if you know about it the Bible says it enjoy en it unto everlasting life you will only get it from the son of man but the son of man the father has sealed him when he says has sealed him that's the fight I'm talking about when something is sealed the Bible says some are ordained for condemnation some are ordained for eternal life in heaven it was God and cherubs and sarim and then some of the cherubs some of the Angels took a wrong direction when they took a wrong direction they took the way of condemnation and the remainder took the right that is eternal life so now the system is like that the fight was in heaven those that were rebellious rebelling against God and those that were siding with God they were spirits and those Spirits came down and when those Spirits came down they incarnated human being on when they incarnated human being it divided human beings into two there are those that are driven by by the by those spirits that Rebels against God there are those that are driven by those spirits that stayed with God are we together now when I'm saying when the Bible says the father has sealed him the word of God is sealed is hidden to those that are not predestinated for eternal life right you'll see as I'm going I said there is life after death I said the different bodies we are in this bodies in this dimension in a certain dispensation we've got different dispensations we've got different body in each and every dispensation are we together so now we have different promises on each and every dispensation whenever there's a dispensation by that I mean when God moves he moves to a certain point and then he changes from a certain point and take another dispensation like what he did with the children of Israel they went out of Egypt then when they reach the river I mean sea they cross over so now it's another dispensation it's another Ministry it's another Doctrine when they went out it Moses said to them get out out of that place out of that place then they went out the the doctrine was out of that place move out of that place so even the angel came and said the death angel the doctor was slaughter a lamb smear the blood do whatever this Angel says he was speaking through Moses that was the doctrine of the time but after they Cross River you cannot say come out they are out they are on root now now they need to have a Ministry a Doctrine that will survive them that will take them through that is why now he says the son of man is is hidden because when he changes people remain behind they don't want to cross the Red Sea as they go to the Red Sea the ministry was Mana right that was the ministry until they reach the border of the River Jordan once they cross the river that is the end of the ministry of the desert so now what I'm saying say now there is dispensation and those dispensation I've got different Ministries different doctrines the word of God as it moves on it changes the people they grow in the Bible [Music] says it speaks about there a little here a little you see that's how you grow there a little there but you grow until you reach a certain stage there are those that will not die but they will change there are those that has departed they are not dead no where they are now they are waiting for the day of [Music] Resurrection there and the resurrection there are those that resurrect now as I'm speaking they share the word of God and the word of God find a place in their heart and when they find a place in their heart then they resurrect they they live the death life and take a new life and when they take a new life they will never go for judgment are we together amen so now I want to say to you in verse 62 verse 62 it says what and if you shall see the son of man Ascend up where he was before now he was here on Earth and then they say he will Ascend and go to where he was before one day they were arguing with our Lord Jesus Christ and then he said unto them you don't know where I come from you see now you cannot know where he comes from unless you know where you come from you see it the first thing is that you should if he says he'll Ascend and go back where he was before where he was before it means then if you are a child of God you are an offspring of God you come from him right and when you come from God you go back to God who's coming from God is returning back to God if you if you come from God then you'll go back to and if you come from God worshiping God will be your priority worshiping God it won't be a pden to you worshiping God it will be a a life to you now when we say now today we have met our brother is departed we it's it's his memorial service now his memorial service is that he was a worshiper worshiping God now that he has departed he's going back to where he was before see now if he he went back where he was before then we we wouldn't cry neither would we Grumble now that would be in a bad mood we will say we will say he has departed going back where he was uh Mary and Joseph were Witnesses Mary met an angel the angel said you will conceive and bear a child son and Joseph was visited by an Angel said now give that son the name of Jesus you see they they they were Witnesses today but as time goes on they made him their child look we have our parents we are born by our mothers and sisters and they made us their children actually their are children is this body they don't know where the spirit comes from they don't even know where the soul come from your father your mother knows only the body [Applause] so that that that that is your natural birth but then you need to have as the Bible says in the book of First Peter can we go into that or second Peter I mean to say second Peter chapter 1 second Peter chapter 1 uh if you read verse three read verse three my brother just listen why am I reading this I want to show you that my body from my mother and father but there's something that my mother and father does not deserve in me right amen Listen Now read verse four whereby are given unto us exceeding great and precious promises that by this ye might be partakers of the divine nature having escaped the corruption that is in the world through now the Bible say it is given unto us exceeding great and precious promises it says great and precious promises there are promises that are precious and that are great are given to us what are those because it says that by these precious by the these great and precious promises you might be partakers of the divine nature divine nature you had your you have your P nature that is not divine I have de nature that is not divine right but the Bible speaks about great it speaks about great and precious great and precious promises now with those great and precious promises then you are able to receive your divine nature now when you speak about divine nature you are speaking about the nature that will never die you're speaking about the character that will never die it's divine that one then that is your real birth the other one you you you are just born to be here on Earth and take the nature of this world or the nature of this Earth but the Bible says Heaven and Earth shall pass away are we together so now that is why we read a scripture that speaks about the quickening it says it is the spirit that that Quicken and he said flesh this flesh profited nothing flesh profited nothing then it continues and say the words that I speak unto you that's what he says the words that I speak unto you they are spirit and they are life so the only life that will keep you eternally is the word that he speak to us and where are those words they are written here the words that you speak they are spirit and they are life now those words if they are alive then they build life in you and they build another body in you and they build another nature in you and they change your character and they change your personality the words right they said here in verse chapter 6 chapter 6 in verse 28 verse 28 just listen then said they unto him what shall we do that we might work the works of God these people are very serious they want to work the work of God because they saw that this man is is bringing in good words he's building us he's assuring us now they said to him we want to work for God want to do the work of God what should we do listen to what he says Jesus answered and said unto them uh this is the work of God that he believe on him see I was I was telling you about different dispensations that as as the changing we go to different dispensation God give different promises and God raises different people like for instance he came himself they were expecting a messiah they were expecting a very huge person powerful person the Messiah and then they know him all the powerful words that he speaks instead of taking those words they think who is this man they they followed him they find that no he's the son of Jose and his mother is Mary they said no this man we know his father we know his mother we know his sisters and brothers now failing to see that now it's another dispensation they look at the person instead of the we the life that is there right amen that's that's how they missed him how did they miss John John was in another another dispensation his dispensation was to point out the Messiah to show the wealth of the Messiah that they are waiting even today we are saying the Lord is coming all of us will say the Lord but they should be a man that will point to that and say there's the lamp of God John came and pointed him and said this is the L of God they look at him they look at John they look at the Pharisees they look at the Sadducees they look at the scribes no it can't be now now now even today the only way that you should know about the coming of the Lord somebody must Point him somebody must Point him and say there he is apart from that you will follow your ways are we together now what does it say here Jesus answered and said unto them this is the work of God that you believe on him whom he had sent he was referring to himself believe in me because I am the S I'm about to finish so I'm trying to discourage I'm trying to discourage those who think that uh this world is their home I want to discourage you if you think this world is your home and I want to encourage you that there's life eternal there's New Jerusalem there there that's what we are getting to if you say this world is your home you are missing a point right amen let me read another scripture in Revelation 3 I'm I'm about to close Revelation chapter 3 just listen to uh verse 2 21 21 can you read it for us my prayer to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and am sat down with my father in his throne now here is speaking about his throne the Throne of God was in heaven and then it came down to a man which is our is Jesus now today the Throne of God is in the heart of men right now he says to him that overcometh now it's speaking about overcoming you can't receive unless you have fought and overcome when when Abraham met uh the King of New Jerusalem it was after a battle he fought a battle and he won a battle and after winning a battle then he met the prince of the New Jerusalem after fighting now I said when we started here said we are here for a battle it started in heaven it's now here on Earth we defeated the devil I will read you scripture here before I close that the devil and his followers and everything that belongs to him he going to the lake of fire he will never make it right so now it you have to fight and what is fighting it's not a physical War it's a it's a it's a it's a supernatural it's a spiritual one it's a Divine one but he said the Bible says without faith you cannot please God right amen faith in what faith in what you cannot see with your nak we're talking about the new places we're talking about New Jerusalem we're talking about life after but those things we are talking about God nobody has ever met the morning or or in the street there right but we have faith that God is there we see the things we hear the word we believe the word that is preaching we read this word and then it builds us and when the time come that our body our spirit and our soul separate we not going to shout and cry no we go in peace because we know where we are going so that here he says to him that overcometh I will grant to sit in my Throne remember that his throne in you is in your heart that's where your soul is so he says now he will grant to SE with him in his throne that is in your heart that's where your soul is that's where the real you are we together even as I also overcame and I'm sat down with my father in in closing this this scripture that I've written here I mean that I've just read that says I've sat down with my father in his throne now if you're speaking about the father and the son to most people you're talking about two people talking about two people but here he's not speaking about two people no I'm closing this Bible so that you should see that God Amen has got no beginning it's got no ending right amen when God uh want to process himself he has to be a spirit why should God be a spirit and God has to be the we because why because the Bible says God God is a spirit those that worship Him shall worship Him in spirit and why should you be the spirit and God is not two things God himself is a spirit with with a capital s and God is the we in the beginning was the we the we was with God the we is God right is it the third person spoke about the God himself Elohim who is no beginning or end I spoke about the spirit is that the second person and I spoke about the weight is it is is is the third person God if read Exodus 3 Moses saw a burning bush the Bible says God speak in that Pillar of Fire which means he's a pillar of fire god his logos is a is he a fourth four right now when God is processing himself he's processing himself according to different he become a spirit because when the word spoken the word is him the spirit is him the Bible says God Ephesians chter 1 verse 17 says God gave you a spirit of knowledge and understanding this book is sealed you cannot read it as a a university book it needs his Spirit then the the spirit is the one that will guide you but it must go to a point where God himself come and indwell you where you become a minor God not his Spirit not his spirit God himself that's what the Bible says when Jesus said I and my father are one they took Stones you read it John 10:30 John 10:30 then they say he said to them before you throw a stone tell me of all the things that have done which one do you this said for doing great things raising the Dead Walking upon the sea multiplying the bre we don't do but your sin that you are a man you make yourself then he said to them read in your Scriptures it says when the word of God is in you you are God are a minor so now those are the words that I wanted to say before we close that I discourage you I discourage you if you are relying on what is happening here yes it's good wake up and go to work and do whatever you're supposed to do but don't ever think that life here is eternal this world is going to be destroyed the time and signs are telling may the Lord bless you [Applause] [Music] we [Music] [Music] we [Music] [Applause] [Music]
