Title: The End of the Seventh Seal.
Text: The End of the Beginning.

Description: This message was preached by Pastor Israel Nkodima at Mamelodi  tabernacle in South Africa on  the 15 January 2023.

The purpose of this sermon was to teach the viewers and community about the end of the seventh seal, according to Revelation 5:1-7. The pastor read Revelation 5: 1 - 7  “And I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the backside, sealed with seven seals.
2 And I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice, Who is worthy to open the book, and to loose the seals thereof?
3 And no man in heaven, nor in earth, neither under the earth, was able to open the book, neither to look thereon.
4 And I wept much, because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book, neither to look thereon.
5 And one of the elders saith unto me, Weep not: behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, hath prevailed to open the book, and to loose the seven seals thereof.”
6 And I beheld, and lo, in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts, and in the midst of the elders, stood a Lamb as it has been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth
7 And he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne 

He further showed the audience that the Seventh Seal is the end of time, of all things . He made reference by reading the Spoken Words “ The Seventh Seal par 231 “We must remember that this Seventh Seal is the end of time, of all things. That’s right. The things written in the Seven-Seal Book, sealed up, of the plan of redemption from before the foundation of the world, it every bit ends. It is the end; it is the end of the struggling world. It’s the end of struggling nature. It’s the end of everything. In there, it’s the end of the Trumpets. It’s the end of the Vials. It’s the end of the Vials. It’s the end of the earth. It’s the…It’s even the...

I saw in the right hand of him that sat on the throne a book written within and on the back side sealed with Seven Seals and I saw a strong angel proclaiming with a loud voice who is worthy to open the book and to lose the cells thereof and no man in Heaven Nor in Earth neither under the Earth was able to open the book neither to look their own and I wept much because no man was found worthy to open and to read the book neither to look there on and one of the elders said unto me weep not Behold The Lion of the tribe of Judah the root of David hath prevailed to open the book and to lose the seven cells thereof and I behold I beheld in law in the midst of the throne and of the four beasts and in the midst of the elders stood a lamp as it had been slain having seven horns and seven eyes which are the seven spirits of God sent forth into all the Earth and he came and took the book out of the right hand of him that sat upon the throne uh I mean I mean okay so let us pray our Heavenly Father Here We Come Again before they're talking of the almighty God we know the Lord you said when two or three are gathered in your name you are also in the midst we believe that you are with us this morning you yourself has come to serve to serve your people father thank you for eternity thank you for predestination that's why we are here happy people when we are sick you heal us when we are sorrowful you give us peace your father you have promised all these things that they will come upon us as your children here is the word father out of the book no other book which like this book that's why we come on the first day to do nothing but to worship amen as even the prophet said on the first day this is the day of Resurrection wherever you are make sure that to worship him on the resurrection day which is the first day that's why even today we are here a lot knowing is the resurrection day and we are here to worship the one who resurrected and the father for our peace our healing eternity father is with us we are already in eternity and thank you Lord as we open the scriptures you are the only one who can speak to us as father I ask your blessings upon all and their healing upon all in Jesus Christ name amen amen you may be seated amen amen foreign [Music] yes he is still dead so there's some floods then the United States and everywhere United States so Flats everywhere uh according to his weight he said as it was in the days of Noah [Music] so we are seeing this being fulfilled and then we can say the Lord has spoken and it is we were listening even to and this year can be the year of the rapture [Music] I'm not trying to frighten those plain future and so forth because those that are going in the Rapture are going home amen amen and and the Lord Morena will never just leave us out without at least knowing that the rapture you know uh it is even in our souls it can happen without us having it first amen now it's already in our souls that's why I can't plan for any any other future I have already seen it okay but fella let us look into the scriptures I want to take the seasuba you know last time we even I think that was at a conference we had a something in this manner what is the great secret foreign foreign I don't know if we have received the answer now there's a great Secret that was beneath yes now you will understand I can't

United States I want to go a United States we've seen Alabama and [Music] we even I said to the brothers you know there is my brothers somewhere there but I know God is also somewhere amen God will take care of them we were in California also under Flats uh when we were there maybe really cool we were sitting with the brothers and I think I was speaking to a brother how the prophet of God at one times pointed the fingers and he pointed at California as super California Los Angeles in Los Angeles and so forth and I said Karen but there's children of God all right amen when God started to point his finger at Sodom and Gomorrah tomorrow there was somebody there to be safe amen and God did that he saved his own apology that there's some predictions [Music] about the coming floods or fires amen [Music] that's why we you know that our brothers foreign [Music] okay now I I I've got a jotted here the end of the beginning um I was looking at this word in the beginning was the way but now you've got to wind back and I'm sorry that I don't have it on a church in the beginning was the way are you watching my looking at my fingers are you watching my fingers amen so you can fold it back like that okay okay because God has got no beginning amen amen that's why when he approached Abraham um why especially to Abraham and how he dealt with Abraham the one who has no father no mother [Music] because that is the only Ministry that Abraham would understand amen if in his full page in your eye the message is brought forth to him by his a person who has no father no mother that's not me and that's why now Matthew fine cannot hear any message because now that's why the secret under the seventh seeds it says when he opened the seventh section what happened silence now that's why he says amen because the activities and then the the man yeah who has forfeited the book as we are looking here how uh they look for somebody who was eligible take the book yeah from the one that said the book was there but they were God was waiting for somebody because if we read in the Bible okay let me read you something here if I've got it here with me amen and if I don't have it I'm just going to quote to you where it says Satan Satan was the god of every now if you go back help while I'm around you realize that uh Lucifer Lucifer who was the right hand man of God and then after his fall he was cast down to the Earth now remember who was who had the booker the book was given to the men Adam Lucifer yeah Lucifer was the right hand man of God but after he rebelled and the Bible says he was cast now when he arrives because he had a post position he was looking for a job again he saw Adam was there to mend the garden and uh that was the position so he thought of taking that position from Adam this is what he did he says then he became the God of this Israeli World facility not the god of the earth you know the Bible says God formed the Earth now the world is this yes let us just talk and then we realized that in the Bible more be willing every time God when he created then he said let us make men and there was no other image but he said in our image all right amen then afterwards he said I mean now it takes me back to where I read the prophet man is the other part of the contract foreign when God after he created something then he would send it to Adam Adam was part of the country is that right amen even today you came here saying to yourself I'm going to hear the word of God because man is God's partner amen [Music] foreign I don't know how many times come to me and then we will say maybe my hand this is this just by holding and saying something in my heart then the disease I'll be saying something in my house because the soul out of soul is part of God you understand all right amen now let's go to this scripture now when I I want to read you something yeah Satan Satan was one time you're talking about Isaiah 14. Isaiah 14. yeah Where You Are I have gotten old book here it's very a baby but it is still very active how how I die without falling now Isaiah 14 12 in the verse 12. how are thou fallen from Heaven o Lucifer son of the morning how are thou cut down to the ground which did weakens the Nations for thou has said in thine heart I will Ascend into heaven I will exalt my throne above the stars of God I will sit also upon the mountain of the congregation in the size of the north I will Ascend above the heights of the clouds I will be like the most high yet thou shall be brought down to Hell to the side of the pit that they that see they shall not only look upon thee and consider this saying is this the man that made the Earth to tremble that did Shake kingdoms that made the world as a Wilderness and destroyed the cities thereof that opened not the house of his prisoners amen that's verse 17 17. amen yeah you are right you've got it here that is that that was this Lucifer Lucifer yeah Lucifer Lucifer for thou thou has set in thine heart I will Ascend kids amen amen just like a member in the church oh who will say root foreign I've had this weight every time the way up is the way down fast I will Assange you know I is a dangerous thing I thought it should only belong to God he's the one who says I am the Lord [Music] amen amen I belongs to God all right amen now they're full of men is this word that's why I always you hear people saying you see me I mean myself that's the phone it's not saying he says Ah it's not saying him but he says I all right amen okay the name Lucifer you're a Lucifer he started to say well I will Ascend above the heights of the clouds I will be like the most highest you know God wants us to be he made us in his own fashion amen amen when he made us he made us as much to worship Him you know I mean a spirit that doesn't worship God is not from God you know because I who went in we come becomes that demands God [Music] even when people start to take legs they'll be talking nice nicely but do you watch them afterwards it is and he becomes amen amen you'll see wonders in God but only the day you quit that is falling away I will all right amen even the Bible says never say tomorrow I'll do this and that and this is the right way is to say the Lord willing if it is the will of the Lord a sheep it's a being that is foreign I mean a sheep needs a shepherdish amen right now what happened the fall of Adam and Lucifer then became the god you're the Lucifer of this world I don't have my book here but you know it the one that says Adam was the God of this Earth you know it I mean God just said let us make men in our eyes amen but after a fella come around ever foreign even the Lord Jesus of this world okay amen now usually we come to this I read yeah this seventh seal in this book is Page is the end of the time of all things all right amen that's why you know you need to know what is the secret under this service Heaven is silence you do not expect anything from you you did not expect to hear from him the seventh amen amen yes sir now we're rich [Music] the seven seal is the end of time of all things the end of time yeah you know even men sometimes he comes to the end he is still walking talking but after the end because without God you are ready he is life without him you are you have no life that's why I'm I'm hearing things yeah the end of the beginning no creation my book here I don't know if I I have it but if you're talking about creation did we read out of the book everything that was created has an image because you have the Creator and he is Without End yeah he is now everything that was created Buffalo your body was created that's why it has amen amen how I can be rich I can be poor it can be this is buried brother let me tell you something foreign now time comes and goes your feet I can't rely on that my body is tired my your body has got no eternal life how can I really something that

still a baby the mind is depending on the mother but later come around amen amen it will start to be independent from the guidance of mothers he has he's got his own Direction that's why you read in the books I was watching on the papers one will say I don't want somebody amen amen I want to be what I wanted I I left the package because you regarded the message of God as a slavery don't do this but if you look at the Sheep when it is and the lady can say come around that's why I quit they want you to put on rulers but the man is not like a ship that's right but if you are a child amen
