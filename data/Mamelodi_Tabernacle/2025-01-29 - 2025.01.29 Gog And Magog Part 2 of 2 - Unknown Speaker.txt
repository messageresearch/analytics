it to that position or to that position and they are capable of of hitting Jerusalem that's when America was threatening Iran and Russia said on the papers we read that on the papers he said if America ever attacks Iran maybe he will do a little damage [Music] because America knows Russia knows very well that the project there is his project the nuclear project there the nule his own nuclear [Music] project amen amen so if somebody says something against Iran Russia stands up and he takes note of that and the leader of Iran he calls America the great a big Satan or great Satan and Israel as little Satan that is Iran the leader of of Iran and he said um if ever Iran is attacked we will hit back very hard that is Iran amen amen so you know America looks at this other places like Iran

Israel must be removed of the map amen now the language is the language now he is just a spokesman but the speaker is russan they call it had the great bear bear The Great Bear that now this goog of Ezekiel after the Rapture is referring to the King of the North which is Russia coming up against Israel after the rupture there's some terrible things that are happening during that period 3 and a half years the prophet even says there's some things that are being oppressed because the the Holy Ghost is still here very terrible things and he says but after the Rapture they will surface amen there are even terrible beasts don't don't try to say I'm superstitious they are there are terrible beast and things in the rivers in the mountains but because the children of God are still here [Applause] am they are suppressed amen amen but when the bright leaves the Bible That's why says who unto you the inhabit of the earth and of the sea because Satan is cast down and because he knows this time is very very short but it says Rejoice you in [Applause] heaven now the prophet says that is the raptured Saints today he was talking to the raptured Saints says Rejoice you in heaven because when these things shall take place the bright shall be somewhere [Applause] else all right amen amen so the bride can sing Hallelujah and so forth [Music] amenu for he shall not allow his wife to go through this things amen you just hear of the beast but the tribulation period that is then the time of the Beast amen amen not the mark on youran Amen not the Beast all right amen the Incarnation of Satan and they will just kill and kill and kill to establish a kingdom 3 and a half years that's when the the devil will be trying to establish a kingdom here so all the opposition shall be trembled upon amen that's why the sleeping Vision those who shall miss who will miss the rapture and the the prophet say they will be good people but they will miss the Rapture they were not in the bright material they will be patched through the tribulation period That's when John says who are they amen and they will be given white ropes they will be called out of the tribulation but through they will be patched they'll go through some terrible times but because the prophet says because they treated the children of God well they respect it what God has done in his people they shall be rewarded and that's when it says he shall make them to stand uh like goats on the left hand side and the Sheep on the right hand side and on the right hand side shall say to them for you have seen [Music] me they are they are rewarded because of the good works amen amen and uh and their good behavior so but they will not be the bride even in Jerusalem without amen but they shall come in and out in and out amen because the bride is in the city amen but this good people God shall reward them and at the white Throne judgment he shall say to them um all right let me say the the way the prophet puts it the Bible says the books were open and another book which is The Book of Life Now imagine the bride was uh translated from The Book of Life into the Lamb's Book of Life amen now you are thinking the prophet says it's one book The Prophet says yes it's one book and it's two books he says you are transmitted from this into [Music] this those in the Book of Life Will judgment when the queen and the will give out the Judgment the bright there's some people that are in in here and they'll be there judging amen amen amen they just still going through the the school of law or whatever you call it amen they still go they just here uh doing their practicals here by amen you know that amen you know did you know that the Bible says the books shall be opened do you know that we have the books are being opened amen the seven book the seven churches book amen amen it's here already in practice people have been judged already here amen amen amen that's why the Judgment the Lord Jesus says the same Moses will judge you telling the Jews that's why at the Judgment B it's not a thing of coming before the Lord and say God I used to go to church but brother Soo goip about me and I got so Disturbed in the church no no no no no no it's not like what's name the cour what do you do here in our courts of law you answer and tell lies and on the day of this I was not even in I was you get what I mean there it's already in the books amen and the word says behold I will send you Elijah the prophet otherwise if if if not so I will SM the whole Earth so if you come here the tape is already there amen amen now let's continue with reading the Judgment now amen amen now that's why the very same people you rejected they will be looking at you like this [Music] amen amen if you steal from somebody and you know exactly that he has seen me now you come to court you find that man looking at you amen amen it's going to be now I want to close let me read you some few things what is happening right now I've got a book here Jerusalem Countdown I will read you it says I will read you something here from this book and uh uh that is the Jewish record uh how they seen this things I'll start here we are on a countown to [Music] crisis the coming nuclear Showdown if I could have things my way I would show you all of you what is nuclear power there's a bomb that destroyed hirosima nasaki that's nothing it goes they say it goes 70 times into one nuclear as the prophet says they are there hanging in the hangers there and yet men go around boasting and they are just there with the names of the [Music] targets if this one was made specially to destroy pror then they wror only one nulear miss can hit Pia and render it into and leave it as smoke going up to heaven one one need needs only one bomb that is what they call nuclear bomb once it drops somewhere it leaves that place upside [Music] down but from that bomb uh a radiation and maybe in the speed of I'll check what this they registered the speed of that radiation reled by the impact of the bomb it is released by the impact that radiation those who are far from pitor they will be destroyed by the radiation amen amen so that is what they call nuclear bomb all right amen now I will read this we close we'll see next time this is a Jewish record this Jewish record we are on account down to crisis the coming nuclear show Down The Showdown with Iran is a certainty the war of Ezekiel 38 to39 could begin before this book gets published so although they are not in the bride to know that it's after the Rapture but they know of the certainty of it Israel and America must confront Iran's nuclear ability and their willingness to destroy Israel with nuclear weapons for Israel to wait is to risk committing National [Music] Suicide if they can wait leaving Iran to develop that [Music] bomb it will be a risk amen amen the leaders of the Islamic revolutionary government of Iran are passionate in their hatred for Israel and America no prophetic scripture is more crystal clear than ezekiel's Vivid and specific description of the coming massive war in the middle [Music] in the Middle East E that will sweep the world toward not this hammers when what what they're coming show down amen amen they they know about it the Jews is the Jews here they know of Ezekiel propy and they know that Iran is part of that [Music] prophecy now they say ezekiel's War as described in chapter 38 and 39 will consist of Arab collan of Nations [Music] it will consist of Arab coll of Nations led by Russia for the purpose of Exterminating the Jews of Israel and controlling the city of Jerusalem the Russian pay off will be the ability to control the oil Rich paan Gulf this is what the Jews have discovered now now just before we close let me read you something again here H this will be from the same book as I joted some things down here and I will turn back to something uh yeah um I read was it how uh you spell it amen but I will start here I asked the former prime minister where Iran was in its uh development of nuclear weapons admitted that during his administration Israel intelligence had informed the United States Israeli in intelligence informed the United States intelligence community that Iran was working on a medium and long range nuclear [Music] missile that would be capable of hitting London New York and Jerusalem Yem now Mr now continued with a shocking Revelation that the United State intelligence Community was very skeptical of the Israeli intelligence because they know that no one can make a nuclear bomb without the knowledge from either America or Russia or so later Israel intelligence gave photographic proof to the United States intelligence community that Russian scientist who made nuclear weapons for Russia during the Cold War were now employed and we're helping Iran achieve its dream of developing nuclear weapons amen amen so now from there um now confession by father of Pakistan's atomatic [Music] bomb Pakistan that's what Israel considers them to be friends now a scientist Pakistan there's a scientist in Pakistan they in good terms whilst America trusts Pakistan considering them to be their friends this man is an Arab now here is his confession I have sold nule to Libya Iran and North Korea Korea those are the people that America is fighting you know of North Korea and North Korea how when the Iraq War started America was also concerned of the North Korean Korea but North Korea also threatened like Iran North Korea he said should somebody attack us we will chase him catch him and punish him and punish him they were referring to to Bush To America that is North Korea Kore now the knowledge they got from H this father of Pakistan's atomic bomb the article written by Ahmed Rashid confirmed that the father of Pakistan's atomic bomb has confessed to selling nuclear weapons cigarettes so this secret like us as children of God it's not like this if you take the cigarettes and sell them the prophet says it's it's impersonating and it means death what I mean is you come here oh the third pool is this thing and the seventh seal is this and then you start say You Don't Preach well here I'm leing you've got the secrets now you are going to sell now the prophet says you are going to die like you know Pharaoh how they came behind they came behind and when Moses smoke the water and the water parted so Pharaoh's commanders could also read the same thing and all right so how you walk down on the ground uh dry ground the sea it's possible to walk on the dry ground in the mid of the sea so he said to the [Music] Army now listen for a while they walk like Israel on the dry ground Israel was ahead you know with the Thunders the seals the seven pools was ahead you know shoo him from this to that and shooting from that to that Pharaoh's Army enjoyed for a while the dry ground working also amen then the children of Israel they reach the other side and what Egypt thought was also their Ministry swallowed them up it's going to happen like that people they follow the people of God they walk on the dry ground you know between the problems of this world and all those new forms of worship and all those things they also threaten the same but they won't go far the floods are going to swallow them up let me read the last article we'll see next time the admission that Abdul I don't know whether Abdul let's say Abdul Abdul freely sold nuclear technology to Iran Libya and North Korea then I will skip to this officials said that Mr Khan first began to transfer designs drawings and components for guest to Iran between that is for to to to to to uh for them to be able to make a nuclear bomb uh in [Music] 19899 and uh 1991 1991 there is clear evidence that Iran has been seeking to develop nuclear weapons for 20 years so Iran can Jews now the Jerusalem Post Bernard headline of AUST 523 bluntly stated bluntly stated Iran can produce nuclear bomb by year 2005 2005 amen amen so let's stop here now all these things they are telling you that this will happen after the so it chose that the rupture is if then America has already started to employ some missiles and so forth to me I don't know to some other people to me it means the Rapture is just here amen because without the people of God being taken away these things cannot take place amen we thank the lord we have seen the beginning of it and don't you worry from the scope there we will see the rest of it [Music] amen amen Abraham Abraham he was was not in Sodom Andor but he saw the [Applause] smoke amen he he he saw Sodom the Bible says from where he stood with the Lord amen I I read to you these things I will read to to you this things he stood one morning he went to a place where he stood with the Lord and from that place you could see Sodom Andor and we know that after the Rapture we will be with the Lord and we will see amen amen [Music] hallelujah hallelujah [Music] hallelujah hallelujah amen [Music] amen we may stand on our feet Saints I see that there's a baptism but what mighty God we serve we'll read next time I will arrange with
