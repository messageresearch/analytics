Description:
Title: The True Worshippers
Preached by Pastor Erastus Makuwa at Mamelodi Tabernacle on 11 August 2024

John 4: 23-24 | Job 38: 4 -7 | Isaiah 14: 12-14 | Ephesians 2: 8-10 | Romans 8:19 |

The purpose of the sermon was to show the audience about the True Worshippers.

God asked Job, where was he when God created the foundation of the earth and there was worship in heaven. Worship started in heaven and sin also started in heaven. Sin is unbelieve. 

Lucifer is on earth today trying to work in the church. Lucifer was the original archangel of God. he was the greatest person in heaven besides God. You can't know a person if you do not know their origin.

Flesh is sin and it cannot inherit the kingdom of heaven. Sin is beautiful and it is deceiving by its beauty.

Worship started there in heaven. If you did not worship God in heaven you cannot worship here. Jesus came to save them (the true worshippers) the angels of Michael.

The true worshippers are the insiders. The insiders know of the insiders and the outsiders, but the outsiders know only of the outsiders. The light of the city can only be seen from inside. The Samaritan woman was an insider and she said come and see a man(outside) is this not the Christ(Inside). The mystery of the white stone is known by the insiders. True worshippers are the family of God. True worshippers are the sons and daughters of God.

amen uh chapter 4 verse 23 to 24 my brother 4: 23 24 but the hour cometh and now is when the true worshippers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth hallu for the father seeketh s to worship him God is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth amen then you can read also the Book of Job chapter 38 38 verse 4 to from verse 4 to7 where was thou when I laid the foundation of the Earth declare if thou has understanding who ha laid the measures thereof if thou knowest or who has stretched the line upon it where upon are the foundations there are fasting or who laid the Cornerstone thereof where the Morning Star when the morning stars sng together and all the songs of God shout the sons of God shouted for joy let's close our eyes as we pray you are the almighty God Amen you knew us before the foundation of the world this service you have seen it yes you know who will be in this service am there is nothing which happen by chance everything which

here amen I pray humbly Hallelujah Lord from thee Amen in the name of the Lord Jesus amen take your [Applause] seats so while waiting for guidance or the rure yes as the Bible has told us that the Lord shall descend from heaven together with the saints that has departed because they will rise first the Bible says so we will see [Applause] them now us together with them we will change our bodies also they will also change their bodies even us will change our bodies now all of us having changed we will be raptured together now while waiting for that Amen Let Us continue to to to guide one [Applause] another you know when the soldiers are waiting to get into the the war or the battle exercise they they they they always go into exercises they don't wait for the war on their B exercise they exercise now us also while we are waiting that is the reason why you see us standing in front of youc we are trying to exercise even when a person takes a journey he prepares himself he doesn't say because I'm taking a trip then I'm sleeping but he always we are doing the same here I'm going to make a spiritual lecture I told you I said I'm a student of Elders here and then the pastor the the student is not higher than the teacher you don't judge the the student by the teacher he may make mistakes but not the teacher um here I'm going to make a spiritual lecture um The Heading will be the true worshipers and we must know who are those because when we bring something here is a mirror you look inside the mirror you see whether you can find yourself there if you don't see yourself is either you are Beed your image cannot be cannot be seen cannot be Pro projected because theyed you you must worry why why can't I see myself then this is the scriptures are the mirror always I want to go to what I have placed in front of you I want you or I want to produce or project to you the true [Music] worshippers and then uh you must know them we afraid here the Bible says when the hour cometh and now is it was Jesus talking to his disciples he talks about the hour coming he said now is in other words that that hour is still coming but the hour which is it's just the same with this one in other words we have got true worshipers here but the true worshipers are still coming and they will worship the father in other the worshipers here they are worshiping the and then the the worshipers coming they will also worship the father and when they worship the father they will worship Him in spirit and the truth and we must know what is the spirit and what is the TR because if you don't know that how can you worship him we have read he said God was asking job where were you job because when I was forming or creating the world there was Worship in heaven then it it means the worship was there before the foundation of the world it started there and it came here it does not start here even sin started today and came here and uh sin is unbelief how did Sin start who studed it we know that the one who studed sin is [Music] Lucifer and we have to know who is that Lucifer he was the original Archangel of God [Music] this is this is Lucifer let me just read something here we shall go on so Lucifer is on Earth today trying to work in the church that is Lucifer he's on Earth today but let me read something here Satan was the original Archangel of [Music] God he once dwelt in [Music] heaven he once was the greatest person in heaven of God are you listening you cannot know the person if you know his origin if you you say you know him you must know his or he once was the greatest person in heaven outside of God he was God's right hand man to Fellowship he got p in up in his heart he was coequal with God one day Lucifer Lucifer are you together with me let me read this some here he was that is Lucifer I'm I'm reading about did you know Satan was coequal with God one day he was sure he show was all but a [Music] Creator he was equal with God but he was not the [Applause] [Music] Creator he was everything stood at the right hand of God in heaven a great leading Chim notice the reason that she did all right she was a great leading [Music] cherub he was most beautiful of all these angels in [Music] heaven that's why when he designed his design he designed something beautiful because woman is a design is his design Hey listen carefully you see flesh is sin this flesh it cannot it it cannot inherit the [Applause] kingdom is a pest house it doesn't matter whether it is the the Flesh of man or of a woman but a is a past house but there there is someone a woman the flesh the body this signed by Satan not the woman because the woman in the beginning he was Co equal with men in the beginning they are from one place woman and man but when it comes to the formation is from Satan are you together with I don't say women are from Satan they are from God but the formation even this formation is an animal formation even man's formation but it is like an animal but inside is something there there why when Satan comes with his design he makes something beautiful even sin is beautiful he was a beautiful creature let me show you something in scripture I going to take you back to scripture and throw your opinion as you look at it [Music] today Satan is the one who fetes in that kind of beauty if we notice he was the most beautiful of all these angels in heaven is that right he decided to make Heaven a more beautiful place than the kingdom of Mich is that right also to show that Kan was his [Applause] son he offered a more beautiful worship decorated his altars with fruits and flowers and so forth fruits is that right beautiful sin is beautiful what we call today sin is deceiving by [Applause] Beauty I'm descri I'm describing to you who Lucifer was and who Lucifer is you see Lucifer has many departments depart and ministers in those Department he is a minister of religion he has a minister of religion a minister who is responsible for religion he is even here now [Applause] is a minister who deals with beers and DRS you he has another Minister who Dr and whatever another Minister who deals with Among Us those are the devil's department they they must work hard there this man Lucifer are you together with us we said he tried to make Heaven more beautiful than that of M he said he got puffed up in his heart while he was the right hand man of God he got puffed up that's why you've got people who got puffed up even you can say preach after preaching if you can say you preach a wonderful message he got puffed up every day he wanted to preach when some others preach he said there they have not preached right he wanted to preach because you said he preached right he got puffed up he's the only man who can preach he the only man who can preach right you know where this come from he got puffed up in his he tried he tried to exalt himself and be just as little higher than his boss just read for me isah hey I'm describing lufer we are talking about worshipers but we come let's just describe this man amen CH 14 ver 12 to4 Isaiah 14:2 to4 how are thou fallen from Heaven oh Lucifer son of the morning how thou how how thou fallen from Heaven oh Lucifer he was in heaven he has fallen he didn't come down [Applause] [Music] [Applause] go on my brother how are thou fallen from Heaven oh Lucifer son of the morning how are thou cut down to the ground which did weaken the Nations for thou H has said in thine heart I will Ascend into heaven I will exalt my throne above the stars of God I will sit also upon the Mount of the congregation in the side of the north I will Ascend above the heights of the clouds I will be like the most high he wanted to be like God he wanted he wanted to be like the past when the P want do something better to impress the congregation he wanted to impress them this he exult himself he don't want humble himself he take chances he tried to make Heaven a more beautiful place than the kingdom of M let's read the book of C 78 paragraph 116 I think so I want to read something there you'll hear you'll see it go if I don't see then if I don't see then I I will go I will go forward read another one C 78 c78 I want to read 116 here6 he said in the Revelation chapter 12 there is a woman standing in the Sun the red dragon put his tail around two3 of the Stars two pull them to the Earth we realize that Satan in the beginning set up a kingdom in the Northlands be more beautiful than that of M there was a day he declared war in [Music] heaven he start by preaching after preaching to the angels there preaching unbelief and some believed him to that of Angel believed when he saw that he's now having members he pulled two3 of the Angelic beings with him that is the reason we are only [Music] [Applause] minority is because this man took many two3 is many yeah are you together with me here if you are not together with me don't worry we still going Satan so Lucifer is on Earth today trying to work in the church to accomplish the same purpose that he started before the foundation of the world now as I just got basing up to this that Lucifer in heaven try to exalt himself and even he just be just little higher than his boss he betrayed Michael and make himself a great Kingdom in the north and come down now he and his angels was cast out that is the the aim of the of the devil he wanted to make a better Kingdom he was cast out it was Satan's ambition to be worshiped like God he took two3 of dang ascended himself above those stars and push to them and deceive two3 of them notice that is his ambition now he is ready with his careful selected educated [Music] bride by his own knowledge that is the the angels He has deceived are you together with [Applause] us the war was declared in heaven Lucifer and his Angel were defeated they were cast out of Heaven to the Earth and they see with all his children all angels that he deceived and Michael and his Angel decended this one was thrown down this one descended then they meet here on Earth this one Came from Beneath read John chapter 8 8 oh my God John 8 verse 23 vers 23 and he said unto them ye are from beneath I am from above Hallelujah ye are of this world I not of this world Jesus said to the Pharisees we meet one another here because I came from above you came from then now we meet one even the angels of Lucifer because those phes are some of them then they are [Applause] here the prophet says here he says angel of Lucifer are here and angels of Michel are [Applause]

of the world he came to redeem his own his own that was in him Hallelujah his children that was in him he never came to save the devil's children he came to say the true [Applause] worshipers hey my brother am can you read something there the book of Ephesians chapter 8 verse 8 to 10 just read there chapter 8 chapter 2 or chapter 2 verse 8 to vers 8 to 10 Ephesians 2: 8 to10 let's see the word is saying for by grace are ye saved through faith and that not of yourself it is the gift of God yes not of Works lest any man should boast mhm for we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works we are his workmanship created in Christ Jes Jesus and good works go on brother God has before ordained that we should walk in them God ordained he ordained that we should work in those good works because we worked in them there then we will walk in them when he created you when he created me he created me for the good work when he come he came to save me because I was with him because of sin I was born here in [Music] [Applause] sin say in iniquity it was the only way that I could come then Jesus said I going to save him he didn't come here to save the devil's children they are unsavable [Applause] are Overcomers they overcame Satan and his angels in heaven and they are still overcoming them here they are the ones who overcame Satan in each Church age until in this age until in our age we have got those Overcomers let me read in this book here believing goding God an old man were called into his place he called he said brother come pray for my baby he was calling brother Bram it is in our age he said he got black deia in and it settled in the heart and the Cog shows that the heart has done Dro Plum [Music] back is gone well they wouldn't let us in to pray for the baby but when he got but when he got in there when oh the the doctor you can't do it you got children of your own you can't do it but yet believing God man said now why if the patient was being a Catholic a priest was here to give e the last right would you let him in he said oh he has no children and and now that is not that is not the question this is just a second as the last right [Music] of the church all right finally going in kneeling down by the side of the baby they came in together the the prophet the mother of the child and the father of the child and just prayed a simple little prayer laid hands upon the baby said Lord God Of Heaven and Earth who created all things you give us this divine power to break the power of Satan over this life in the name of Jesus Christ Satan come out of the chur it shall leave turn around the father said Thank you thank you Lord thank you thank you and mother and them began to laugh going on these are Overcomers they overcome the situation they are not overcome by the situation they're looking at the child there dying but because the prophet had prayed after after the prayer they didn't wait for the child to resurrect the child still there in that condition but the prophet had prayed after the prophet had prayed the mother and the father love and they hug one another this is Overcomers [Applause] the little n was upset she said say you know how it is all right to have faith but that baby is TI how can you act so unconcerned about it why you mis you miss understood the doctor the doctor said the baby is dying it's been unconscious now for over a day said you misund the the old patriarch the old patriarch no I didn't I Mis I I misund I didn't misunderstand the [Applause] doctor said I heard what I heard what he said the baby is said why but you you you see when this kogam shows that the heart is in that condition it is never in all history never raised up again in other words a CH in this condition in history we don't have a history of a child coming up again said it is all right to have faith it can't Faith Can Do nothing now see the old man with it with a steady finger looked at the n and said lady you are looking to that chart I am looking to the Divine promise [Applause] of these are those Overcomers I'm talking about here today they started worshiping you cannot disappoint them they worship God under any [Applause] circumstances this decease can't stop him worshiping the the child the sickness of the child can't stop him [Applause] worshiping here is another there is another Overcomer here I think of a little sister here that is brother in the wheelchair sometime how many faithful prayers have been made of eight we don't understand so we just commit it to God she is a flower here among you with a pleasantness and everything see that we can't get up go around how she would how she would long to do that but yet she is Pleasant just the way she sits I always get inspired to watch the little lady we all believe in healing we seen God do Miracles far beyond that she knows that but she is willing to take her place she she she had seen many people getting up from the wheelchairs she was prayed several times but she still remaining the that didn't discourage her she was still a worshiper these are [Applause] Overcomers for me and I'm not I don't know why she's happying God just like [Applause] others these are overcome in your day they will come up and judge you true worshipers are [Applause] founders Philip said to we have found him those are true worshippers we have found him [Applause] of who Moses in the law and the prophets did right true worshipers are insiders the the Insiders know the outside and the inside The Outsiders know only the outside but not the inside the throne is seen from within not from the outside aan woman was The Insider she said come and see come and see aen when you come you are going to see amen see if he not the Christ is a man Jesus outside
