[1:16:05] that we are on the right path amen thank
[1:16:09] you Father that we are in this light yes
[1:16:11] a lot of people are now in the
[1:16:13] denominations they don't even know that
[1:16:15] the prophet is there they don't know
[1:16:17] that you have come to visit people they

[1:16:42] foreign
[1:17:14] and God said let us make men in our
[1:17:17] image after our likeness and let them
[1:17:21] have dominion over the fish of the sea
[1:17:23] and over the fall of the air and over
[1:17:26] the kettle and Over All
[1:17:28] the Earth and over every creeping thing
[1:17:31] that creepeth upon the Earth yes amen
[1:17:34] 27.
[1:17:36] so God created men in his own image
[1:17:39] in the image of God created he him male
[1:17:43] and female created he them hallelujah
[1:17:46] amen so a man
[1:17:51] don't get tired of standing
[1:17:56] was greeted in the likeness
[1:18:00] of God
[1:18:02] hallelujah amen so when you see man
[1:18:05] you see
[1:18:07] who one among we see God when you see a
[1:18:12] man you see
[1:18:14] God
[1:18:16] hallelujah
[1:18:18] amen hallelujah amen because
[1:18:21] when you are walking the streets
[1:18:24] people come to you but walk away you are
[1:18:27] looking like
[1:18:29] you say yes
[1:18:31] don't say yes it was my father hey
[1:18:37] it's me again
[1:18:40] amen because when my grandfather was
[1:18:43] working
[1:18:45] trying to preserve himself
[1:18:48] as he was preserving himself he was
[1:18:52] preserving me
[1:18:55] as he was running away from a lion
[1:18:58] he was running away with me
[1:19:05] so that means this is not me I said now
[1:19:09] this is him
[1:19:12] standing here because without him please
[1:19:26] so let's see what the light came to tell
[1:19:29] somebody
[1:19:30] Genesis 3 verse 6. Tennessee chapter 3
[1:19:33] verse 6.
[1:19:35] and when the woman saw that that she was
[1:19:38] with my brother uh maybe I have let's
[1:19:42] start from verse one all right yes
[1:19:47] now the serpent was more subtle than any
[1:19:50] beast of the field to which the Lord God
[1:19:53] had made yes and he said unto the woman
[1:19:55] yeah have God said
[1:19:59] he shall not eat of every tree of the
[1:20:02] garden
[1:20:03] and the woman said unto the serpent we
[1:20:05] may eat of the fruit of the Trees of the
[1:20:08] garden but of the fruit of the tree
[1:20:10] which is in the midst of the garden God
[1:20:13] has said he shall not eat of it neither
[1:20:17] shall he touch it lest he died
[1:20:20] and the shepherd said unto the woman he
[1:20:23] shall not surely die for God does know
[1:20:26] that in the day he eat day off then your
[1:20:29] eyes shall be open and he shall be as
[1:20:32] Gods knowing good and Ill listen to that
[1:20:35] tillage she's telling when you eat this
[1:20:39] tell me that if you eat this
[1:20:48] um
[1:20:53] you shall be like God because unlimited
[1:20:56] but God already made her to be
[1:20:58] a god
[1:21:03] so you find a lot of people trying to
[1:21:05] make people something which they already
[1:21:07] are or they are not
[1:21:09] um
[1:21:13] so he says to the woman
[1:21:17] Genesis 21 26 says they were made as God
[1:21:22] what in the image of God amen amen amen
[1:21:25] so now six
[1:21:28] and when the woman saw that the tree was
[1:21:31] good for food
[1:21:33] and that it was pleasant to the eyes
[1:21:35] Okay uh
[1:21:37] what did the pastor kodima say about c
[1:21:41] what does c mean
[1:21:43] s
[1:21:47] understand
[1:21:53] that the tree was good
[1:21:56] which God said no the woman now has good
[1:22:00] understanding
[1:22:04] can you see the mistake here now I want
[1:22:07] a person how do you understand something
[1:22:11] don't do that and somebody comes to make
[1:22:14] you understand that
[1:22:17] that it was present to the eyes
[1:22:23] and was a tree to be desired
[1:22:29] to make one wise characteristically fish
[1:22:32] so she took the tree
[1:22:34] she took the fruit thereof and did it
[1:22:39] and gave also to her husband
[1:22:52] so uh the Bible is very good
[1:22:57] a billion years in a in a Bible
[1:23:00] um
[1:23:01] can build it in just one sentence
[1:23:05] in the beginning God created the heavens
[1:23:08] and the Earth
[1:23:09] yes it just stands for billions of years
[1:23:16] to interpret that um
[1:23:20] uh if you want to uh if you want to hear
[1:23:23] that
[1:23:25] I'll take you back to the message the
[1:23:28] unveiling of God
[1:23:31] paragraph uh 1964 paragraph 22. more
[1:23:36] paragraph 22. hallelujah amen now my
[1:23:39] subject this morning
[1:23:41] I trust that God will review this
[1:23:45] and each time if you if you who take the
[1:23:49] tips and listen to
[1:23:52] and I hope trust that you have scripture
[1:23:56] spiritual understanding
[1:23:59] of what God has been trying to get over
[1:24:03] to the church without saying it right
[1:24:07] out foreign
[1:24:27] hallelujah amen he doesn't want all
[1:24:30] people to understand because these
[1:24:32] things are not for them
[1:24:34] that's a thing
[1:24:37] sometimes we have to say things in such
[1:24:39] a way that it might thin down now
[1:24:46] it might bring some to go out
[1:24:50] some to live
[1:24:52] some to Pond over
[1:24:56] but that's done in purposely after sales
[1:25:00] it must be done that way
[1:25:05] then it might be someone to say
[1:25:10] you mean God would purposely do a thing
[1:25:13] like that
[1:25:14] [Music]
[1:25:16] he certainly did
[1:25:20] he does yet
[1:25:24] speaking
[1:25:27] foreign
[1:25:40] was told who would eat
[1:25:44] there's a tree of life
[1:25:48] all these trees
[1:25:53] I mean that tree don't ever go into
[1:25:57] fellowship with a tree
[1:26:02] my brother my sister
[1:26:05] that tree
[1:26:06] was a person
[1:26:10] amen hallelujah amen
[1:26:13] this is just the introduction I'm not
[1:26:15] getting on my message for today
[1:26:18] where these things came from and then we
[1:26:20] go to to the to the message of the day
[1:26:24] what happened in the beginning
[1:26:28] the woman musadi wanted to have more
[1:26:33] Advantage
[1:26:35] she wanted to have her own uh freedom
[1:26:40] [Music]
[1:26:42] because God told her mama
[1:26:46] Mama Don't Preach the Devil Comes saying
[1:26:51] the woman understood yes we can preach
[1:26:54] you know with their equal rights
[1:26:59] she understood
[1:27:01] she saw a born and she went to tell her
[1:27:05] husband
[1:27:06] you know uh they are telling us a church
[1:27:09] now we can be preaching
[1:27:11] she wanted to have an advantage
[1:27:14] the devil wanted a woman to have some
[1:27:18] power
[1:27:20] they wanted what
[1:27:35] the woman uh wanted uh to have some
[1:27:38] power
[1:27:40] so when they had taken the fruit
[1:27:44] and uh this realized they were naked
[1:27:48] so they said Okay
[1:27:51] um
[1:27:55] become uh let's become Presbyterians
[1:28:00] Presbyterian
[1:28:03] so they said yeah yeah yeah it's very
[1:28:05] good let's take a uniform of
[1:28:07] Presbyterian for me I'm a presbyterian
[1:28:10] Hallelujah so uh Adam would be walking
[1:28:15] Adam with that those leaves
[1:28:18] you turn around
[1:28:22] you're looking good
[1:28:42] because as soon as God arrived
[1:28:47] my brother
[1:28:51] that's what happens to all wrong
[1:28:53] doctrines
[1:28:57] in their own Echo chamber who didn't
[1:29:00] know
[1:29:29] the only time in which you know whether
[1:29:31] you are right or wrong
[1:29:34] when God comes
[1:29:38] not when your pastor friend comes
[1:29:41] not when your or your your father-in-law
[1:29:45] who comes reasons
[1:29:55] my brother live any other life or which
[1:29:59] you want to live leave
[1:30:01] but there will be a day which you want
[1:30:03] God to come
[1:30:05] to heal you
[1:30:09] all religion which you have now can
[1:30:12] stand for you at that day
[1:30:19] because Tower when you really need God
[1:30:22] to come
[1:30:23] then everything needs to be all right
[1:30:27] and that is why I tell you my brother if
[1:30:32] you want to know a Ministry
[1:30:34] which God is there
[1:30:37] to look at the way they are preaching
[1:30:40] out the way they are putting the grammar
[1:30:42] together
[1:30:43] the power behind the ministry
[1:30:49] are they getting healed
[1:30:57] are they getting healed now if you go
[1:31:01] with your problem
[1:31:04] does it get solved by the Holy Spirit
[1:31:08] oh it just goes into pending oh wow
[1:31:14] the power behind the ministry
[1:31:17] look at the way we can lecture you on
[1:31:20] the way
[1:31:22] because that's what even uh Adam were
[1:31:25] doing
[1:31:26] lecturing one another
[1:31:34] you know you can see things
[1:31:39] you know the these brothers who are who
[1:31:42] can see things
[1:31:44] yes but there's is there power after
[1:31:47] seeing the things
[1:31:54] uh
[1:31:55] uh three three verse eight Genesis
[1:31:59] chapter 3 verse 8 Hallelujah now let's
[1:32:02] listen
[1:32:06] and they heard the voice of the Lord God
[1:32:08] Walking In The Garden in the cool of the
[1:32:11] day
[1:32:16] what was the voice of God doing
[1:32:18] and they heard the voice of the Lord God
[1:32:21] working in the garden in the school The
[1:32:24] Voice had legs
[1:32:31] the voice of God has got what
[1:32:33] because it was
[1:32:37] where was it working
[1:32:40] no
[1:32:42] that's not for us the voice of God today
[1:32:45] should be walking in Imam a lot
[1:32:50] if you can see a young sister well
[1:32:53] dressed
[1:32:57] that is the voice of God walking killing
[1:33:01] children
[1:33:02] looking for the Lost Eve
[1:33:06] there might be a lost Eve in Social
[1:33:09] movie
[1:33:17] I would rather be like that one um the
[1:33:20] voice of God is still working today
[1:33:23] there is a voice working tonight
[1:33:27] the voice of God which came walking
[1:33:30] ninja
[1:33:32] we didn't hear or in the Bible that it
[1:33:34] went back because foreign
[1:34:05] starting from there
[1:34:09] we have
[1:34:12] uh finished
[1:34:14] Hallelujah now uh
[1:34:18] let me go to uh to the volume one my
[1:34:21] brother let me start from there I got to
[1:34:23] move volume one on one issue my brother
[1:34:25] so let's start all these things from the
[1:34:28] beginning
[1:34:31] amen yes
[1:34:34] so uh if we're going to go
[1:34:38] with the beginning
[1:34:41] at the beginning matoma according to
[1:34:45] Moses it was the creation
[1:34:48] you see there to Moses in the beginning
[1:34:52] God created
[1:34:55] the heavens and the Earth
[1:34:58] that was the beginning according to
[1:35:01] Moses
[1:35:02] but if you can go for a deeper
[1:35:04] Revelation
[1:35:07] you find that when John comes
[1:35:12] in the beginning was the words
[1:35:16] in the beginning
[1:35:19] hallelujah amen so in the beginning for
[1:35:22] according to a deeper Revelation
[1:35:26] in the beginning was the word
[1:35:28] but when the seventh seal is opened
[1:35:33] when you hear from there no longer it
[1:35:37] was the word
[1:35:39] it was
[1:35:41] foreign
[1:35:49] if you are not in God's attributes
[1:35:52] then you cannot be here
[1:35:55] you cannot be in the message
[1:35:58] it has to be that God thought about you
[1:36:02] from the beginning
[1:36:07] amen
[1:36:13] amen
[1:36:19] so let me
[1:36:21] uh
[1:36:22] throw in an atomic bomb
[1:36:29] the end
[1:36:31] my fellow
[1:36:34] is Mount Sunset okay Mount sunset
[1:36:37] after that there's nothing
[1:36:40] once the seven seal comes
[1:36:43] there's nothing left
[1:36:50] people are still looking for things but
[1:36:54] once the seven seal came come on
[1:36:58] that is
[1:37:03] go and read the message is this the sign
[1:37:06] of the inside yeah
[1:37:08] is this the end sign of the answer
[1:37:11] Hallelujah there's nothing after that
[1:37:19] 28
[1:37:22] February
[1:37:24] 1963. curriculum age of February 1963.
[1:37:28] okay now usually if you can look the uh
[1:37:31] if you are checking the Book of Genesis
[1:37:40] you'll find that God is taught Sarah
[1:37:44] that I will visit you
[1:37:46] according to the days of life
[1:37:53] amen they are children here so I don't
[1:37:55] want to talk about the days of Life
[1:37:57] sisters
[1:38:01] [Music]
[1:38:06] Hallelujah so according to the time of
[1:38:09] life 28.
[1:38:12] that's why when you go to heaven
[1:38:16] every 28 days the fruits will be coming

[1:40:27] it
[1:40:30] be because that is where everything for
[1:40:33] you is
[1:40:36] we cannot speak without talking about
[1:40:38] the seven seal and the third pool
[1:40:42] Hallelujah now today
[1:40:45] don't worry uh I'm not going to finish
[1:40:48] anytime soon we should start the subject
[1:40:51] now
[1:40:54] amen So today we're starting on the uh
[1:40:57] Daniel chapter 1 verse 3.
[1:41:02] don't forget what I've said because it
[1:41:04] would be important at the end
[1:41:08] amen it would be very important at the
[1:41:10] end
[1:41:11] because everything starts in the Book of
[1:41:14] Genesis
[1:41:15] in Revelation this is
[1:41:18] there my brother yes verse 3. yes
[1:41:26] and the King speak unto us the master of
[1:41:31] his units yes that he shall bring
[1:41:33] certain of the children of Israel and of
[1:41:36] the king's sea and of the princes
[1:41:40] children in whom was not blemish but
[1:41:44] well favored and skillful in all wisdom
[1:41:47] and cunning in knowledge and
[1:41:50] understanding science and such as her
[1:41:52] ability in them to stand in the king's
[1:41:56] place palace and whom they might teach
[1:42:00] the learning and the tongue of the
[1:42:03] children's hallelujah amen this is in
[1:42:06] Babylon
[1:42:08] hallelujah amen in Babylon
[1:42:12] this is not the first Babylon which
[1:42:14] you're talking about as a member the
[1:42:16] first Babylon babelama Tom is the one
[1:42:19] which Nimrod built
[1:42:24] Nimrod was very clever even though until
[1:42:28] the Bible says
[1:42:30] people they started becoming Mighty
[1:42:33] afternoon minimum Lord
[1:42:36] he was a conqueror but Nimrod had
[1:42:40] something which is very sad
[1:42:43] his own mother was his wife
[1:42:48] no wonder I find there's a church which
[1:42:50] is the mother the wife of the same
[1:42:54] yeah there's a church which the mother
[1:42:56] is a wife as well
[1:43:02] until the Muslims they become confused
[1:43:04] so you say which is which is Jesus
[1:43:06] mother or is this the wife
[1:43:12] but that is all about Nimrod nimrod
[1:43:16] is the one who instituted all Adventures
[1:43:21] of trying to go to heaven without
[1:43:24] repentance
[1:43:29] he told the people and we talk about one
[1:43:31] gentlemen
[1:43:33] no need for alter God
[1:43:36] come and join us building this uh Church
[1:43:41] to Heaven as long as we've got a big
[1:43:43] church
[1:43:48] so they kept in building
[1:43:50] God said they're going to our lives
[1:43:59] so if you see somebody want to build a
[1:44:01] church without repentance
[1:44:08] [Applause]
[1:44:10] [Music]
[1:44:13] you find all these uh I'm not mentioned
[1:44:17] names because of the uh they can they
[1:44:19] can arrest me
[1:44:23] but they are all over
[1:44:25] you see that they don't even mention
[1:44:27] repentance at all
[1:44:30] mention about cleaning up at all
[1:44:33] what that measure is
[1:44:41] foreign
[1:44:51] let's work together to build up this
[1:44:53] thing
[1:44:55] when you come there
[1:44:57] they don't ask you to repent around
[1:45:02] until you can steal money from the
[1:45:03] government and give it to them
[1:45:11] to build the Tower Hallelujah
[1:45:15] so you can see here one or more it says
[1:45:20] his King Hoshi was very clever King
[1:45:25] he said to the to the eunuch
[1:45:31] I want those brothers who are doing well
[1:45:34] among these people
[1:45:43] I wonder about those just make sure that
[1:45:47] those those princes of these people I
[1:45:50] wonder
[1:45:53] because he doesn't want to use others
[1:45:54] because he wants the princess people
[1:45:56] which people can understand
[1:46:01] without blemish those who are skillful
[1:46:07] when the devil wants to work in the
[1:46:09] church
[1:46:11] he will look for the princess
[1:46:15] Nebuchadnezzar
[1:46:40] is it there foreign
[1:46:52] [Music]
[1:47:06] my friend and I were were they
[1:47:10] experiment
[1:47:11] the experiment to make sure that the UCT
[1:47:14] becomes black
[1:47:18] new city was all white when we joined it
[1:47:24] so when we were there hey they were
[1:47:27] treating us very badly but uh we
[1:47:29] survived
[1:47:31] I was in
[1:47:35] the neck blocks in the day yeah
[1:47:39] they were speaking hey
[1:47:50] somebody said my brother
[1:47:52] this is nothing just go to store and
[1:47:55] watch my brother hey
[1:47:57] um
[1:47:59] they want you to learn their language
[1:48:02] but they don't want to learn your
[1:48:04] language
[1:48:08] so the first thing which is that
[1:48:10] somebody does
[1:48:12] to defeat you oh fenya is to remove your
[1:48:15] language
[1:48:18] Hallelujah my language is changed
[1:48:22] for you to do the language has changed
[1:48:25] again you have to say I know brother we
[1:48:28] are the same you know all churches are
[1:48:30] the same we are brothers in Christ who
[1:48:32] told you we are brothers in class or not
[1:48:36] our language is one
[1:48:39] you are the sons of the devil we are the
[1:48:42] sons of God
[1:48:47] don't change the language change the
[1:48:49] language it's the trick of the devil
[1:48:53] all these United Nations Human Rights
[1:48:56] was
[1:48:58] United Nations
[1:49:01] our language is a woman must not preach
[1:49:04] language
[1:49:07] we are not going to speak their language
[1:49:11] so he wanted to speak them to be
[1:49:13] speaking to be speaking their language
[1:49:21] Hallelujah
[1:49:24] so
[1:49:26] let's go we see the King was very very
[1:49:29] clever what he was doing horses
[1:49:33] and the King
[1:49:36] and the King appointed them a daily
[1:49:39] provision of the king Smith just imagine
[1:49:42] and of the wine which he drank just
[1:49:45] imagine so nourishing them three years
[1:49:48] that at the end thereof they might stand
[1:49:51] before the king
[1:50:06] speaking our language
[1:50:11] the meat is there for you
[1:50:15] and you know
[1:50:17] Nebuchadnezzar Nebuchadnezzar is the
[1:50:19] Golden Age of a gentile disposition
[1:50:22] email

[1:50:28] was eating the president America
[1:50:39] disposal
[1:50:44] don't give them those uh quotas no no
[1:50:48] don't give an importance
[1:50:53] these ones give them in the meat which I
[1:50:57] eat myself
[1:50:59] my brother one is
[1:51:02] what privilege this gentleman had
[1:51:07] how many of you would still speak this
[1:51:09] language if they meet him
[1:51:16] how many of you would start speaking the
[1:51:19] language yes
[1:51:29] how many were we that time
[1:51:34] do you remember
[1:51:35] there were so many brothers
[1:51:38] all of them when they meet him
[1:51:43] a message
[1:51:46] my young brother
[1:51:49] who is going to University now
[1:51:51] University remember you're going to eat
[1:51:54] the king's meat today
[1:51:57] don't forget our language
[1:52:07] we were many brothers in this message
[1:52:11] but as soon as the rain started going to
[1:52:15] the pocket people forgot the language
[1:52:19] they started eating the king's meat they
[1:52:22] started taking the wine of the kief
[1:52:27] but if you go to verse 8 more of S8 it
[1:52:31] says eerie but Daniel
[1:52:35] purposed in his heart
[1:52:37] that he would not defile himself with a
[1:52:40] portion of the king's meat
[1:52:42] Dan Daniel
[1:52:50] therefore he requested of the prince of
[1:52:52] the eunuchs that he might not defile
[1:52:54] himself
[1:52:58] amen amen the book is here which I'm
[1:53:02] preaching from
[1:53:03] the beginning and the ending of the
[1:53:05] gentle dispensations

[1:53:23] Babylon that he was not going he was
[1:53:26] going to remain a believer

[1:56:04] of reason when I'm in captivity
[1:56:08] I still remember Zion
[1:56:12] we got a place
[1:56:14] amen we've got a place
[1:56:18] we got a position in Christ
[1:56:21] which we need to maintain
[1:56:25] regardless of whatever is
[1:56:35] amen amen you know success is sickness
[1:56:45] you know
[1:56:46] [Music]
[1:56:49] at the hospital

[1:57:03] you don't mind the way you are dressed
[1:57:17] even if your father-in-law or
[1:57:20] mother-in-law was there you don't mind
[1:57:21] about the way you are dressed you are
[1:57:23] very sick

[1:57:56] go and see check with the brothers who
[1:57:58] have left to come into church ask them
[1:58:00] how are you brother literally they will

[1:58:45] write down
[1:58:46] he does not where he is
[1:58:53] what time is it now
[1:58:58] he will not even know what time it is
[1:59:03] amen
[1:59:05] so they will write in the book
[1:59:08] this is oriented in place persons and
[1:59:13] time and space
[1:59:14] foreign
[1:59:29] [Music]
[1:59:46] is disoriented
[1:59:48] he has forgotten where he is
[1:59:56] Hallelujah so we have to purpose in our
[2:00:00] hearts
[2:00:02] Branham says
[2:00:05] Daniel did it without the holy ghosts
[2:00:10] we just remembering Zion
[2:00:14] but he was purposely in his heart
[2:00:17] regardless of whatever position I'll be
[2:00:19] here
[2:00:29] amen
[2:00:32] my pastor will be my pastor
[2:00:36] my dick will be my dick
[2:00:39] because that's what he came from
[2:00:44] he never wanted to go
[2:00:47] that's where we came from
[2:00:49] what we wear in his attributes
[2:00:54] that's what we want to
[2:00:57] remains
[2:01:01] has given us
[2:01:06] hallelujah amen
[2:01:09] hallelujah amen
[2:01:11] [Music]
[2:01:13] one time
[2:01:15] at home there about about 10 years ago
[2:01:22] so I saw a lot of prisoners are learning
[2:01:25] they were running foreign
[2:01:45] away
[2:01:56] so we are trying to go and catch them
[2:02:08] he had been in prison so good it was so
[2:02:12] comfortable in prisoners
[2:02:28] he's been well fed in prison
[2:02:32] where he's so comfortable that you want
[2:02:34] everybody to remain in prison
[2:02:43] hallelujah amen
[2:02:46] Daniel Daniel
[2:02:47] remained a Believer
[2:02:50] made so today I want to give you an
[2:02:54] interpretation of a Believer
[2:02:57] according to the children's
[2:03:19] what can happen so the king had a dream
[2:03:25] so when that dream got gone away from
[2:03:28] him
[2:03:30] he couldn't remember
[2:03:34] so it was the uh The Magicians
[2:03:38] the dream
[2:03:40] The Magicians couldn't tell him the
[2:03:42] interpretation
[2:03:46] then he told them I'm going to kill all
[2:03:49] of you
[2:03:51] I'm going to kill all the wise men All
[2:03:54] The Magicians you are useless
[2:03:56] you are supposed to tell me the dreams
[2:04:02] they came and maybe in a political way
[2:04:04] to tell the king I know there's no such
[2:04:07] a king which is asking his people to do
[2:04:09] this
[2:04:16] let's go to chapter 2 verse 10. the
[2:04:19] chaudians answered before the king and
[2:04:22] said there is not a man upon Earth that
[2:04:25] can show The King's mother
[2:04:28] therefore there is no King no Lord no
[2:04:31] ruler that has such things of any
[2:04:34] magician astrologer or chardian
[2:04:40] um
[2:04:55] 11. it is a layer thing that the king
[2:04:59] requires
[2:05:00] there is none other that can show it
[2:05:02] before thee except the goods
[2:05:05] who's dwelling is nothing fresh
[2:05:08] horses
[2:05:18] so the careers were saying
[2:05:21] if somebody does this
[2:05:25] that is a God
[2:05:42] you accept people who are becoming
[2:05:45] devils
[2:05:47] [Music]
[2:05:50] amen
[2:05:52] so
[2:05:53] the Dream came
[2:05:56] can have volume three please
[2:05:59] and here's the interpretation thereof if
[2:06:05] that's the dream
[2:06:08] the King was thinking well
[2:06:12] on his bed
[2:06:14] when he was sleeping at night
[2:06:17] what will become of my kingdom
[2:06:20] I am a very powerful
[2:06:25] but what will become of the Kingdom
[2:06:28] God spoke to
[2:06:30] nebuchadnezzarella of which is the
[2:06:33] interpretation he didn't know
[2:06:35] but when Daniel came to him
[2:06:38] he told him your kingdom
[2:06:42] will change it to the patients
[2:06:47] who come to the Greeks
[2:06:49] after the Greeks who come to the Romans
[2:06:53] after the Romans they need to be very
[2:06:56] very mixed
[2:06:57] they'll be Republic of South Africa
[2:07:00] and the Republic of Tanzania a
[2:07:04] Republican union African Union
[2:07:08] Asia Pacific Union Asia Pacific Union
[2:07:16] but remember
[2:07:18] Daniel didn't tell Nebuchadnezzar
[2:07:21] Daniela said but your kingdom is going
[2:07:24] to finish
[2:07:41] the man who has ever come on Earth and
[2:07:45] represented God is foreign
[2:08:39] so
[2:08:44] even if you are reading this you're
[2:08:45] listening all of you are listening to
[2:08:47] Moses All of You are listening to Moses
[2:08:50] Moses speaking they needed someone
[2:08:54] come and tell them
[2:08:56] he was speaking Hebrew um
[2:09:00] was interpreting Hebrew to the Hebrews
[2:09:03] ourselves
[2:09:07] so he was telling them when he said uh
[2:09:11] that means he said God has created
[2:09:17] so what what was required since I was
[2:09:21] going to find Moses
[2:09:24] who understands Moses
[2:09:29] [Music]
[2:09:32] the word of God is Not of private
[2:09:35] interpretation
[2:09:37] now you have to find the Moses
[2:09:41] but when you find Moses you have to find
[2:09:44] an arrowhead
[2:09:47] is a priesthood prista
[2:09:54] hallelujah amen
[2:09:56] so a man who can tell you your dream
[2:10:00] and the interpretation
[2:10:03] that one is the god
[2:10:07] hallelujah amen the same picture my
[2:10:10] brother one issue a picture nailer so
[2:10:12] you can see there
[2:10:15] is a man
[2:10:19] is a stamina
[2:10:21] so if God is a stamina
[2:10:26] you can see there's a money
[2:10:31] but when God comes to interpret this
[2:10:36] on Daniel 7. you will find that
[2:10:41] beasts of play uh
[2:10:46] the head was a lion
[2:10:48] the best was a leopard
[2:10:55] they are animals
[2:10:58] because animals can follow stand for
[2:11:02] power
[2:11:09] I'm going to lead
[2:11:11] amen
[2:11:13] so Alexander the Great was an animal
[2:11:15] Alexander the greatest
[2:11:21] were animals
[2:11:29] so
[2:11:44] that thing becomes animals
[2:11:51] hallelujah amen you see God don't try to
[2:11:55] be uh speaking for God because they're
[2:11:58] going to confuse people
[2:12:01] because you find people are busy in the
[2:12:05] church
[2:12:10] this is not what God was what was trying
[2:12:13] to say here
[2:12:15] because
[2:12:17] this was foreign
[2:12:39] that is where my brother my sister
[2:12:45] you can't just start a Ministry from
[2:12:47] nowhere God has to send you somewhere oh
[2:12:48] God
[2:12:54] hallelujah amen God is a stamina
[2:12:57] you can speak a little here
[2:13:09] amen amen
[2:13:15] me was the one that the seventh seal now
[2:13:17] gonna see things
[2:13:20] so what let's see Harmony
[2:13:24] how will are we going to
[2:13:26] know that this animal is this
[2:13:30] God did show us right away here
[2:13:35] right away here
[2:13:37] Daniel was shot
[2:13:39] Daniela won chitra
[2:13:47] 725
[2:13:51] verse 25
[2:13:53] how would you know that this is is that
[2:13:56] animal now
[2:14:01] so
[2:14:02] 5 7 25. what how will we know that this
[2:14:06] is the animal and he shall speak great
[2:14:09] words against the most high and shall
[2:14:12] wear out the Saints of the most high and
[2:14:15] think to change times and laws and they
[2:14:19] shall be given unto his hand until a
[2:14:22] time and times are divided and the
[2:14:24] dividing of time hallelujah amen which
[2:14:27] animal on Earth
[2:14:29] people have changed our times
[2:14:36] which calendar are we using please
[2:14:41] which laws are we using
[2:14:44] it
[2:14:47] and actually I can tell you this
[2:14:51] the first Caesar Augustus
[2:14:55] his mother was Julia
[2:14:58] Julian so that's why there's a mass
[2:15:01] to his mother
[2:15:03] him Augustus in Augustus was an Octavian
[2:15:06] evenly Octavia that's why there is
[2:15:08] October for himself
[2:15:14] Changing Times
[2:15:16] 365 days or a Roman calendar calendar
[2:15:20] the best of the sun is on 21 to 21st
[2:15:24] December
[2:15:25] um
[2:15:26] that's the day which is the the sun is
[2:15:29] returning back from the Tropic of
[2:15:31] Capricorn going back to to Europe
[2:15:37] so he was able to change the laws
[2:15:41] and the times leading now and nobody can
[2:15:44] do that anymore now
[2:15:45] we have seen what this Beast is is
[2:15:54] which is being talked about here says
[2:15:57] because it is a beast which was able to
[2:16:00] change
[2:16:10] [Music]
[2:16:20] version 13.
[2:16:24] and I stood upon the sand of the sea and
[2:16:28] so a beast rise up out of the sea yes
[2:16:31] having seven heads and ten horns and
[2:16:34] upon his horns ten crowns and upon his
[2:16:37] head the name of blasphemy yes and the
[2:16:41] Beast which I saw was like unto a
[2:16:43] leopard yes and his Speedway as the feet
[2:16:46] of a bear and his mouth as the mouth of
[2:16:49] a lion
[2:16:49] and the dragon gave him his power and
[2:16:53] his seat and great Authority hallelujah
[2:16:56] amen
[2:16:57] Daniel Daniel because God told him
[2:17:01] you cannot understand all this
[2:17:07] go and sleep it will be interpreted
[2:17:10] later on
[2:17:12] now we find that uh
[2:17:28] that same Beast has become one yeah
[2:17:34] according to the United Nations see we
[2:17:36] try United Nations
[2:17:39] they give me the uh the volume for the
[2:17:41] United Nations
[2:17:43] we don't know where the heads who is the
[2:17:46] head of the United Nations
[2:17:56] this power Mata has become mixed
[2:18:01] now is a power yeah
[2:18:05] hallelujah amen hallelujah amen amen
[2:18:10] let's see uh
[2:18:12] how we can identify this power now we're
[2:18:16] going to identify it don't worry let's
[2:18:19] go to 13 verse
[2:18:21] 13. Ariana
[2:18:27] yes
[2:18:29] and he dwell he doeth great wonders so
[2:18:33] that he may have fire come down from
[2:18:36] heaven on the earth in the side of me
[2:18:39] foreign
[2:19:33] foreign
[2:19:45] so the power is coming together
[2:19:48] but remember
[2:19:51] the devil had a purpose from the
[2:19:53] beginning
[2:19:58] amen so if you go to 14 or 14 says what
[2:20:02] 14 he deceives Men by voice
[2:20:07] Twitter
[2:20:08] uh
[2:20:10] or foreign
[2:20:24] by the means of those Miracles which he
[2:20:28] had power to do in the side of the peace
[2:20:30] saying to them that dwell on the earth
[2:20:33] that they should make an image to the
[2:20:36] Beast which had
[2:20:38] the wound by a sword and deadly amen so
[2:20:43] he diseases by miracles
[2:20:44] for a commission I'm telling you there
[2:20:46] are so many miracles happening right now
[2:20:48] which you don't understand
[2:20:51] [Music]
[2:20:53] you work in finance
[2:20:55] your money transfer
[2:20:58] not quite
[2:21:00] he works in finance but doesn't
[2:21:01] understand because the way they have
[2:21:04] made International money transfer is so
[2:21:07] clever that it's only America if you
[2:21:09] don't have a corresponding Bank in
[2:21:11] America
[2:21:14] for money around the world
[2:21:22] the way they have made the internet
[2:21:28] it's all so clever
[2:21:31] yeah
[2:21:33] Miracles being done inside of me inside
[2:21:36] of men
[2:21:37] but it's all to deceive people
[2:21:43] but that is what God has given us to
[2:21:45] identify who is the Beast because
[2:21:51] from the beginning the devil had a
[2:21:55] desire Hallelujah
[2:21:58] hallelujah amen he wanted to give if
[2:22:01] power obvious
[2:22:10] hallelujah amen hallelujah amen
[2:22:16] what why did he mix up all these powers
[2:22:24] let's go to Revelation 17 verse 1.
[2:22:26] Hallelujah
[2:22:31] and there came one of the Seven Angels
[2:22:35] which had the seven vials and talked
[2:22:38] with me saying unto me come hither I

[3:04:09] disease from the
[3:04:10] beginning
[3:04:11] from The Book of Genesis
[3:04:18] hallelujah hallelujah
[3:04:21] Babylon Babylon is still standing and
[3:04:26] the Bible says when the stone hello
[3:04:29] speaker can I have the stone again
[3:04:42] yes I need the stone okay
[3:04:44] the the yeah that's the story
[3:04:49] not cut by hands
[3:04:54] nobody had it a hand in that one I swear
[3:05:01] it's going to expand
[3:05:04] it is going to expand for mommy
[3:05:08] to uh
[3:05:13] Cape Town Cape Town Restaurant is
[3:05:15] expanding and it's filling the whole
[3:05:18] world
[3:05:19] until the enemies go nowhere to hide
[3:05:24] that's the stone which has come kill it
[3:05:26] secretly to take down the image of the
[3:05:30] devil down
[3:05:39] barbell is in danger Babylon Equity
[3:05:42] because the estonians come
[3:05:44] the Revelation has come to lately and
[3:05:47] each and every one of us
[3:05:50] says the importance of a revelation
[3:05:53] cannot be over emphasized
[3:05:59] every one of us
[3:06:01] have to have their own peace of Heaven
[3:06:08] foreign
[3:06:43] K2 H2O yeah H2O isn't it okay H2O all
[3:06:48] right I mean okay what about this glass
[3:06:50] is containing What last year
[3:06:53] the h2oj can take out face in guy
[3:07:00] you take many of them
[3:07:03] whole church
[3:07:06] can do a bigger job isn't it
[3:07:09] because when the H2O comes together the
[3:07:13] H2O coupon then they are used becomes
[3:07:16] better
[3:07:19] but the chemical formula is the same
[3:07:23] yeah myself on your own ownership
[3:07:32] you can't even quench first
[3:07:36] let's come together
[3:07:40] because when we are together
[3:07:44] there's a God in you
[3:07:46] god in me when we come together we can
[3:07:50] do a bigger job
[3:07:55] so when we come there where when the
[3:07:58] water from
[3:08:00] swazilands
[3:08:03] they make this zombies
[3:08:06] when they come to cupboards
[3:08:18] come together
[3:08:22] but if you go alone we all know
[3:08:26] you are H2O or h2o you are going alone
[3:08:30] we all knows go and sit on on the
[3:08:35] sunflowers you immediately you've never
[3:08:37] seen this is
[3:08:48] fight
[3:08:57] all the goodness vaporized immediately
[3:09:03] but when you come together with us
[3:09:06] we move together recipes
[3:09:28] and we Rin have made it deliberately
[3:09:32] that we will not be part of the cosmos
[3:09:36] of this world
[3:09:39] we have a bigger thing which has been
[3:09:41] shown to us
[3:09:43] the revealed words
[3:09:53] amen
[3:09:55] what was the word of God doing in the
[3:09:57] Garden of Eden
[3:10:00] walking will it be it was working
[3:10:03] Elizabeth I mean the word of God
[3:10:09] isn't it now what is the word of God
[3:10:12] doing in the Book of Revelation
[3:10:17] what's the word of God doing in the
[3:10:19] Revelation
[3:10:21] the word of God is riding a horse in
[3:10:24] Revelations
[3:10:33] they're aware of what is
[3:10:40] not a book as a book
[3:10:43] the word of God is
[3:10:46] a person moved to
[3:10:48] so who is the word of God
[3:10:52] as we are becoming what is written in
[3:10:56] there
[3:11:01] you remember when they're teaching you
[3:11:02] uh economics economics what do you
[3:11:06] become what do you become an economist
[3:11:08] Economist yes if you are teaching me the
[3:11:11] way what do we come
[3:11:15] amen amen amen but you have to go to the
[3:11:18] school we have the teaching the way yeah
[3:11:20] because sometimes people can tell you
[3:11:22] they are teaching you economics
[3:11:24] economics
[3:11:27] people can tell you I know I'll teach
[3:11:29] you how to fly a plane but you'll find
[3:11:30] the plane is made of leaves
[3:11:35] the Revelation has to be where you have
[3:11:38] to find the correct teacher
[3:11:42] so if you are teaching me economics what
[3:11:44] do you become
[3:11:47] economists
[3:11:50] at the end I become wise
[3:11:55] amen so it will be the word of God
[3:11:57] walking
[3:12:00] [Music]
[3:12:02] amen
[3:12:05] remember
[3:12:08] to you
[3:12:11] you become the word
[3:12:15] walking in the light him is the light
[3:12:18] and you become the light amen walking
[3:12:22] the light him is alive and you become
[3:12:27] the Lord you become what you each
[3:12:30] offered to ourselves amen
[3:12:39] um
[3:12:40] sorry I don't want to give you another
[3:12:41] example because people can become angry
[3:12:48] amen if you come to Malawi come along
[3:12:51] and ask my brother
[3:12:54] who is my son
[3:12:57] that what is the name of the pastor in
[3:12:59] the another church he just saying there
[3:13:03] he'll tell you I don't know
[3:13:07] but people are busy in their houses and
[3:13:09] people telling their children the
[3:13:11] problems of other pastors what do you
[3:13:13] want them to become haters
[3:13:21] because if you teach somebody
[3:13:24] Witchcraft and you want him to become an
[3:13:26] economist is it
[3:13:28] um
[3:13:33] if you want somebody to become to be a
[3:13:36] mathematician
[3:13:39] you teach the mathematics
[3:13:42] you tell them
[3:13:44] f x is equal to or f80
[3:13:49] minus W squared times y squared divided
[3:13:54] by Z squared
[3:13:57] they will become mathematicians
[3:14:03] foreign
[3:14:53] so it is you who will be
[3:14:57] hallelujah hallelujah
[3:15:00] if you want to know where the word of
[3:15:02] God is
[3:15:12] you know in Malawi most of the ganja
[3:15:15] which you smoke here comes from my life
[3:15:20] there's a person
[3:15:26] so people smoke so much but why how do
[3:15:30] they sell themselves I am Pilots
[3:15:42] yet there is surprises
[3:15:56] but he's giving me a plane move Festival
[3:15:59] flight or is a human flight against
[3:16:04] everybody calls him a Bible age
[3:16:10] there's a problem come which needs a
[3:16:13] pastor let the problem come which means
[3:16:15] the pastor in fact the pastor says
[3:16:22] because there's no power in him
[3:16:27] the word of God has got what
[3:16:31] the same way which Walked In the Garden
[3:16:34] of Eden
[3:16:37] on a horse
[3:16:42] behind that
[3:16:45] um
[3:16:49] I don't want to talk about testimonies
[3:16:53] but uh my brother
[3:17:06] something happens
[3:17:11] because the word of God now is sliding
[3:17:13] on a horse
[3:17:17] the woman is riding on what is
[3:17:20] a beast
[3:17:23] can you describe that Beast
[3:17:27] it's just a mixture of things
[3:17:32] Democratic power demonic power money
[3:17:37] [Music]
[3:17:43] you can see it's just a mixture that's
[3:17:47] the power of the enemy
[3:17:49] the power of God
[3:17:51] who have power over the power of our
[3:17:55] Devils
[3:17:58] you remember the role of alone
[3:18:02] are the Mastery over all other Roots
[3:18:11] those people
[3:18:13] those roads had been their houses for
[3:18:15] too long
[3:18:18] they stay in the house for too long
[3:18:34] they say oh no no the Lord of godima has
[3:18:37] swallowed our roads
[3:18:42] they were disarmed by clearly covered
[3:18:45] unfortunately some of them it was a
[3:18:47] walking stick
[3:18:50] I don't know how they walked home
[3:18:58] they were completely disarmed by
[3:19:00] children by the power in The Lord of
[3:19:03] Alone by Taylor Martin
[3:19:08] was the lord of the Lord
[3:19:14] so the power of God is
[3:19:22] good is
[3:19:28] healing position is a bit
[3:19:31] is to tell people where the power of God
[3:19:34] is
[3:19:35] the main things
[3:19:42] the main thing is
[3:19:45] that's why we are here so tomorrow we'll
[3:19:49] hear the words
[3:19:51] don't run away because
[3:19:55] if we teach you economics what economics
[3:19:58] what do you become
[3:20:00] an economist if I teach him mathematics
[3:20:03] what do you become teacher mathematics
[3:20:05] mathematician you know in mathematics
[3:20:09] car met they are very difficult things
[3:20:11] to do it
[3:20:15] if in mathematics
[3:20:17] you come to divide by zero whatever
[3:20:20] divided
[3:20:21] how many you are teachers there if you
[3:20:23] divide by zero in mathematics they will
[3:20:25] say you are such a deadly sinner in
[3:20:29] mathematics mathematics
[3:20:35] because if you're not careful we are
[3:20:36] going to start dividing by zero
[3:20:39] you have to be taught very well
[3:20:42] that the power of FX
[3:20:46] can only come from -3 to plus three
[3:20:50] don't go outside there it's not our
[3:20:51] power of your area amen
[3:20:54] zero
[3:21:04] and then there will be a problem you
[3:21:07] need to operate the way evil is taught
[3:21:11] operate within this area this is your
[3:21:13] area
[3:21:14] but if wanted something bigger
[3:21:17] to make an advantage to herself or write
[3:21:20] the real advantage and here we are in
[3:21:22] trouble
[3:21:25] people looking for their own advantages
[3:21:28] the scene of if
[3:21:31] the sin of the World Series when they
[3:21:34] have sought their own salvation without
[3:21:37] asking God first
[3:21:41] the doctrine of nimrod hello
[3:21:45] they want to go to heaven without to
[3:21:48] repentance
[3:21:52] we are going through the way of the
[3:21:54] Cross
[3:21:57] and it's not easy my brother my sister
[3:22:05] in case there's anybody here who doesn't
[3:22:07] have problems God bless you so much
[3:22:13] but all of us are fighting
[3:22:19] and who win that battle it will have
[3:22:21] faith unto him by the word of God which
[3:22:25] is taught by in on this puppets
[3:22:33] praise the Lord
[3:22:38] and I'll save no falling
[3:22:45] away
