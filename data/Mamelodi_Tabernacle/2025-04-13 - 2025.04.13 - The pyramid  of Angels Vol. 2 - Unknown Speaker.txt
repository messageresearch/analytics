People that have been with me. people that have uh understood uh my weaknesses and uh look at me through the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ. The people that have prayed for me, the people that have wished me all the good which has allowed me to be the person that I am today. 50 is a great number. The great the first uh man to speak on a 50-year jubilee was William Brham in 1956 when he counted the years of the revival. Say now that is 50 years after that some decisions must be made. And I know the best place take decisions. It's in the presence of the Lord because he's the one that begs our life. It is with so much love that I stand before you this morning as I don't believe I'm really I'm growing old. I believe I'm growing wiser. I believe now I know better. I know better how to bear with people, how to understand people, how to carry the burden of others. I thank the Lord for your presence. I can't name everyone, but you know that each and everyone has a place in my heart. I will start by thanking the pastors that have come to be with us today together with their wives. I just want you to give them a round of applause for this moment. the honor they have given unto us to be here before everything. My greatest gratitude goes to the Lord Jesus Christ, my Lord and my Savior, the person for whom I have lived my old life. I have been privileged in my earthly life to live only for him. I thank God that he never allowed me to know a worldly life that he called me in my very young age. I never took a break from him. I never make a step outside then come back. I vow to live for him to honor him and to declare his goodness in the land of the living. I always tell young people that I am a testimony that a young man can be a Christian without any excuse. I thank God for that for his care and protection over my life. I can say now like the David which I am here to represent that I was young and now I am old. I have never seen a righteous forsaken. Yes indeed. I will also in this day remember my mother who gave birth unto me and my father with so much gratitude. I would love to also make this day to be a great tribute to what they have done in raising me and becoming the man that I am today. If I am a blessing to people, it's because God used some vessels to bring me on this earth. I salute them where they are. Though it's not easy for me to be far away from them, but I am so much thankful unto them. May God bless them richly. I had when I was walking in here, a brother told me that uh my mom sent sent a clip. I don't know if it's true, but or she just wanted me to feel good. Uh is it true where oh you are there is it true? Okay so I will just be very short um uh in saying some few words because today I wanted uh I have uh my father around pastor Kodima. So I told him, "Yeah, I was born 50 years back." It was on Sunday on the 13th of April, 7 days after the birth of the prophet. [Applause] [Music] And uh I met pastor Kodima for the first time 7 years after my calling to the ministry. Uh he represent a lot unto me. Told him I want him to come and dedicate me today cuz I am born today. I I'm so thankful that Omar is there as well. God bless you mama. So much uh uh thankful unto the company that you have made around my life. Like uh Jesus was saying you know for you who have left your mothers your fathers I will give you mothers give you fathers. Amen. In this world, not in the coming world, in this world, I will give you in this world. Then in the coming world, eternal life. Uh but before I invite him, just wanted to give a short testimony cuz many time when somebody's dead, then there is someone who come and start reading about what the dead person was. He's already gone. All that you are reading is useless. Sometime is good to speak when the man is still alive. That's why the prophet say give to a man a rose when he still alive. It will benefit him more. So just a quick short story of myself as a testimony. Uh I was born on the 13th of April. Like I say it was on a Sunday that is 50 years back. And that's why I think I live all my life in church cuz I was born on Sunday. So if somebody sees me out of church, he must take me to a psychiatrist because my mental was made to be a church. So my father uh testified to my wife when we were still uh get when we were still young uh getting married. She told my wife Yeah. She told he told you he did not tell me you know how fathers are. So he told my wife that uh it was when this man was born that we decided to find the way to the Lord. Because when I was born, my mother got very sick and uh I was born in uh in in Kinshasa in the Democratic Republic of Congo at that time, Zer. And the city was having an upmarket uh upper market suburb of European. And uh at that time my father was a very right h a highranked man. So I was born in the best environment where in a hospital where the president goes and where all the great people of the society they go. I think that's why pastor Kanik is here. He knows that place. So that we call the clinic GMA. Yeah. Um I was born there and uh my mother got sick and they tried to take her to all the best hospital and she was not recovering. So they decided, my father said they decided to go to a a lady, a mama there kind of healer by the invit by the advice of friends and that old lady gave them something that I was supposed to take so that my mother get same school. So I'm not a nobody. So uh because my father wanted me to be very close to the things that are religious and uh for the high school uh they took me to a Protestant school where uh we call it the Shaumba. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It was the best school of the country still until today. uh my principal was the minister of uh social affairs something like that and um I grew up in that environment uh with uh people of very high rank. My father really counted on me to be a great scientist and a great man in the society. But uh later on God came in and changed my direction. I think I had a picture here when I was 15 years old. Brothers, you always disturb my day. I told you if you mess with today, I remove your name from the book of [Laughter] life. Uh so then I think uh around 15 years old I I think at 14 years old I took the decision to be baptized and uh without the pressure of anybody without the request of anybody at the baptism queue uh people did not wanted to chase me out. So that's me at home. I'm 15 years old. Somebody told me, "Hey, you were you you used to love watch." I say, "Hey, I used to love good things." So that watch I was wake I was wearing. My father bought it for me. It was a very expensive watch at that time. Um I want to remember the brand um uh eh uh uh because uh he told me if you can pass 80% to go into uh uh uh uh the second section of high school because we had two sections of high school that I think I'm going I'm grade nine there. So then I had about 90%. Then uh so I was saying I I was really very intelligent. Now I don't know where it's gone. So I was really the best of my peers and uh I was I really made my family proud at that time because I was really very good and uh after that I think the that the there's another one for from university uh uh brother. Yeah. So this Oh where is me? Oh, the second. So, this is uh this is UPC. Yeah, UPC. Yeah. Then uh I went then I went um I had to be my father wanted me to be a medical doctor. So the day we went at the university at uh first year of uh so in our year I think you remember our first year at the university and uh first year of uh doctors they removed from the faculty and we went in the the big hole. Yeah. So when I enter in that big hole I was not comfortable because I was used to small classes. So then I I was not happy and they requested if I can take a transfer. I say no I want a small room. Then they say if you want a small room you have two options either you go for poly techniques or you go to science here uh a pure science. So I had to go to pure science uh because I did not want to be an engineer like my father. So then uh in science there I had a great experience with God. Uh that's when I received the baptism of the Holy Ghost. So when I finished there, I got my first employment as a product uh developer uh there. Yeah, this was my first job. I was 23 years old there. Oh, it's also there. So, this is 1998 as usual. So I started at a junior level and in few months I was taken at a management level and uh after that uh I made my branch to be the best of the whole continent and I was taken into uh kind of a political environment where I have worked in the government for some few days for few years sorry to and I was too young and the environment was not very good for me. So what happened? I think uh e I was saying that after my science uh when I got there and I realized that business was the way to go and I went to do some management statistic statistics uh uh uh uh college and uh I carried on with uh my education uh I think the numbers I can't count now maybe the Lord God has helped me in the journey at least uh to have in my background about uh almost three degrees now in which two masters accounted in engineering management and MBA and uh now finishing the data science and the Lord willing I'm preparing my PhD as I am already accepted. So that is briefly what I have been in my life but uh my life had a lot of things when I brothers you are late I won't go back there uh you can see I was wearing size 30 now I never believe I will be big one day yeah you know this place I saw you there also so uh this was I think uh 997 97 Asia this very and that you remember you know the pastor of that church um where the revival no not ano uh kang yes before the ano came from this church yeah so we see we have been with the lord very very far. So, um I wanted to say I was trying to say something. I believe when I turned 25 years old, uh I had an experienced with the Lord. Is that this is this is my first uh Yeah, this this is at my house, my first place. This is uh where I was living my first day. I'm not yet married. That's why I'm in the kitchen. So, but that when my wife saw me. So, I think she said herself, I must replace him in that kitchen. So, um I think that was maybe the same year I met her. Um am I am I somewhere? Uh yeah, you see we were still young serving the Lord and we have never quitted. We are still there until now. It's good to serve the Lord. You see, we are in the tent and so forth and we are there until today. Uh the Lord was so faithful and merciful unto us that uh we have seen great things. I think when I turned 25, as I was saying, that's when I got my uh a great experience with the Lord that led me to be here today. Yeah, I think that is my 25th birthday. I I was really a good man. I used to be handsome. Ah, and now I've lost so many lights. So, yeah, that was the day on my 25th birthday. Uh, yeah. You see, so you just come today, you don't know where we come from with my wife. So yeah that I think when uh we just started maybe we are not I think we were not yet married there. I think we got married a year after that. Uh that's when I'm still praying in English. [Laughter] Pastor Moses say there is a power to pray in English because the witches didn't go to school. They won't hear the English [Laughter] prayer. Okay. So this uh year of my life was uh very indicative of my future. That's when I got an experience to be connected to the ministry in the way I am now. That's when I got a different vision of the gospel. That's when I also got detached from my home and my family. uh not because I had a problem with um being away but because I realized that the vision that God gave unto me still needed to find a place where I will get people who can be able to understand it. uh because uh in the religious system I was really cast out because uh people thought that what I'm saying I'm creating them. You know I'm born in April. I'm very vocal. When I see something when he say no I say no. You cannot just turn me around. I can die for what I believe. Isn't it pastor Ron? So when I believe in something, no one can move me out of it. And that's how I lived. Support was taken away from me. I lost many things and but I kept on moving on. The Lord helped me a lot. I think uh and he has give me the opportunity to start meeting these friends of mine like the pastor Ron and so forth. First time we met in Cape Town. Uh then we went uh we met we were in Kinshasa the pastor Dioka's meeting in 2007. Then uh pastor Ron told me uh you I must take you to our elder. So we drove one night to see pastor. I think it was 2007 eight. Okay. And that was my first time to see uh to see pastor Kodima. And I felt such a connection. I felt like as I have been running away to find that connection when I met him the way he was just talking said but this is the man I was looking for. I needed somebody who can rise because you know like the pastor was saying here an eagle will catch a snake just fly high then the snake is paralyzed with the altitude. So you need somebody who can fly at that altitude then now you are able to now communicate and we really went along very well. The men of God here have has really been great support unto us. Uh the Lord fulfilled his vision for our lives to start the ministry here. I think uh there were the first person I was speaking to, pastor Rooney, Pastor Allan. Uh then uh we were starting to pitch tenties around here going door todo to call one person to believe in the Lord Jesus Christ. Then one was coming and we baptized until where we are today. I thank God for so many things uh that he has helped me in this life of mine that I have never caused a trouble to anybody. That one I can thank God for that. you know to be a minister at 50 years old and you have never splitted a church. H you must really be proud of that. But in my record I have never splitted a church and I will never and I have never went into a church start digging for members because I don't believe in that. I always believe is if a man splits a church, God will never enter in that church. You have to repent first. And for me, repenting it mean go take those people back. And if you have a calling, go on the street and preach to one person, to two people, three people until you have an established ministry. Then we believe in your calling. But those callings of easiness of today where somebody just he was a deacon then he recruit members tomorrow he's a pastor. I unfortunately I don't believe in that. You know I'm born in April. You can't change me. Amen. Amen. H I think this picture is when I was still I was working in the housing department. I think this was uh as I was working as a technical advisor in social development of uh infrastructure the connection between infrastructure and social development. uh I think it was water uh world day of water something like that and uh that day I was just with the deputy president and uh but today I am a minister of the gospel it's bigger than being in the world thank you so much for being here uh brothers you're still carrying on with your photos you can Stop. It's fine. We have already seen these photos. Actually, it's myself. I was there. I just wanted to give a brief history because some people don't. They just see me behind the pulpit. There's a brother who was asking me, "Pastor, where did you come from? Did you drop from the sky or what?" Because we don't we only see you alone. We don't know if you grew up somewhere. We don't know if you have parents. Are you making me or what? Say no brother, I have a past. It's just that God has given me a new life. Amen. So, uh just before I call for pastor Kodima to come, I am closing with these words to say I am so thankful to the Lord. I am so thankful to you and I am so thankful to everyone who tried something one day to make my life easy somewhere. Life has not been so easy for me. I have suffered so much rejections, so much exclusion just because of my view. I thank God that I have never been out of him, never lived in the world, never defiled myself. I remained a Christian and I remained his servant to be a blessing for somebody. And I know that that day when you did that, you said that good words to help me move on. When you prayed for me that day, the Lord granted your prayer. That's why I am standing here today. You can give a round of applause for yourself. So maybe brothers uh since the mother uh my mom requested that the short clip if it's long you will cut it. You know these mas when they start talking sometime they don't finish just one minute for it. Are you ready? Ah brother I'm giving one minute. You still asking for one minute. Are you ready for it, brothers? One minute. Okay. God bless you, Pastor Moses. When I knew you, you were a young [Laughter] [Music] man. I don't think Abibu was born at that time. So, but now we are growing. We are getting somewhere. Amen. The Lord has been so good. I thank the church here, the final voice uh for standing with me. You know, I don't take no sense. I'm a very difficult person to live with. When I say no, it's a no. Oh, I hear my father's voice [Music] there. Yeah. So, I was still giving my uh technology is always the devil love technology to disturb the spirit. Look, now they are putting him upside down. Yeah, but he's upside down. It's not fair. Oh, you're looking for problems. Please brothers, pray for my brothers. There you see these young men. Some of them are not married. Maybe that's their problem. It's jubiline. They must be free. Pastor Moses was saying it's not time to preach repentance. It's time to preach [Laughter] Jubilee. Amen. Are you going to win, brothers? So I think we we have to call the pastor. So uh as they are preparing I just want to get my friends here. Each one of them can come and just say a word of blessing for me. Then when they are done, we get the pastor for the sermon. Uh let's pastor Moses, can you please come and say something? Just a word of blessing for me. That's why you are here. You know, you are four. They're like four living creatures. Amen. Are we all happy to be here? May God bless you richly for coming. I greet you in the wonderful name of Jesus Christ. H I thank God for pastor David. We came from far. The Bible says h that friends must show himself friendly. So I'm not going to say what I wanted to say because h corruption might set in. I see time has been prolonged but I cannot sit down without saying something. Amen. We came from far. Pastor David H has got many friends, many ministers friends that if they can come here h they can fill up the whole wall. So but h by God's grace we are four of us. Why? Because many are called but few are chosen. So h I thank God that you have chosen me from among many pastor friends. Amen. So and h you know I was just to see the character of pastor David you know that they are star they are bold. Pastor David is a bold man you know ambitious and they are also pioneers. So even if all of you you leave him he can start again because he's a pioneer from inside. So he's a fighter. Amen. And he's also a naturalb born leader, tenacious and is not scared. He's also not scared to take risks. You see, so that those are the is also caring and loving. I think the wife and the children can agree with me. Hallelujah. So I just before I go, I want to read a scripture. you know he was talking about uh he says the theme of these meetings it's h go free so I was just thinking when I was preaching on Friday about the emancipation uh proclamation so you know when I was studying that I realized pastor David that Abraham Lincoln in 1863 he it was January 1 1863 Number three, he signed the Emancipation Proclamation to set free all those who were bound, who were bound and everything. And then as if it was a a coincidence, 100 years later in 1963, the mighty angel came down. It was another, can you imagine, pastor? 1863 the bill was signed for to emancipate the slaves and 100 years later uh the mighty angel comes in 1963 that's the real emancipation the real freedom is when the seals were opened and he came down with a what rainbow over his head and you know what a rainbow means it means a covenant So when God we saw the rainbow, it was a covenant that God was not going to destroy the world with water. So today 1963, we see another rainbow, another covenant. You know, God saw by himself because he could not saw by any greater but he saw by himself. So there is a covenant, an author. Amen. He saw by an oath that you and me we are going to be free. So an order it's a higher level of a vow. An author is different from an ordinary vow. An oath is more binding. So he saw by an oath that we are going to make it that we are going to be free that we are going to be emancipated. May God grant unto you as desires. Shalom. God bless you. Thank you so much, pastor. Indeed. Uh you are chosen. It was good to have pastor Moses here for this weekend. Amen. How many love our pastor, a friend, wonderful man of God. Yes, Pastor Rooney. Uh please come. God bless you, my friend. Good to have you in this weekend. I so much appreciate your presence. Thank you. I thought I was pushing pastor William to come and then you call my name. Greetings dear ones in the name of Jesus Christ. Also greet Mama Goda in the name of Jesus and the church and my old friends all of you. You are greeted in Jesus Christ's name. H there's not much to say. I'm also waiting you know for the word of God to be preached. and my cup or my umbrella has been turned upside down uh to get more water to drink. So, uh I was actually requested to send greetings and love from the has been built by God through the gift our pastor and his life also has been designed by God. You know whatever ambition he had or whatever plans he had in life, God altered that. And today we see the pastor David that we have never started with but was started with God. I got oh there are small things that made him to be this great and those are small things that should not be despised or forgotten. May God bless him and his family and his church. Shalom. [Applause] Dr. Interplanet. This This one is a worldwide missionary. There's no in churches in two different continents. One in Canada and one in Spain. Pastor, how do you do that? and you're a medical doctor. God bless you. God bless you. [Music] I'm so happy to be with you this morning about Pastor David like a [Music] man. Is there anyone speak? If there's anyone who speak Is there anyone who speaks English? Okay, everybody speak English in heaven. There won't be only English speaking people. Everyone will be there in heaven. I would like to talk to you, Pastor David. God has granted me to meet people. I'm born a pastor [Music] son and pastor David too is a pastor son. We have different nature. Pastor David is someone who lo his own way to do things or see things. I've been born in a family of pastors. Pastor is my uncle. And so to build the tabernacle, we we bought everything. We both traveled all over. We were not interested in buying this and that. And one day I was coming from India from Australia. I could see that the trip was too long. So I said I will make a stop. So we came to pastor David and pastor David. We went to a [Music] mall where we trying to shop for shoes. So, Pastor David was watching screen, checking for mics, looking for [Music] things exactly like pastor tracks or prices. Uh, I really loved what he was [Music] doing because he was really deep in the things of the Lord. I really loved what he was doing. Now you pay attention to uh my my wish take pastor David to the pharmacy of God in the pharmacy of God. They are drunk. Drunk. Yes. Drunk people. Drunk people. Yes. They are drunk people. Drunk people. Uh Jesus was a drunk people. Drunk man. Yeah. Don't afraid. Drunk. Drunker. The drunker. The big drunker. Big drunker. Jesus was a drunker. I would like to take pastor David there. This world is led by two powers. The first power is God. The second power is Satan. Those both powers and Satan works with fear and God works with love. Fear will produce unbelief. Satan fear is the devil. Satan Satan will make you sick. If you are feared to not move, I will ask him because I would like to take him to the pharmacy so that he can take the medicine because when we operate our sick people, we put some medicine or two We use opium or like that's ania. When I do operation, [Music] I make sure to use the right the the best anesthesist and God anesthesist is the anesthesist. So to take F he had to put F. is that in the medicines and one of them is message uh let off the pressure in 56 paragraph 52 talking about anesthesis I would like to talk about opium the prophet says Have you already seen someone under the world the whole world belongs to you? He's talking about he's talking about it in the message. Why much You see 40 prophet says people think we are fool the [Music] devil it does have a [Music] substance so at 230 God is true opiums and opium. It was delivered coming from after the flowers that when you tell it, it will quiet the fire. Even if they will tell you that you will die tomorrow, you won't be imagine a drunken. He does not he's in a state allow him even to it does not danger full of opium. Is that your man? How can you liberate the boss? Put a sentence to a sentence. so that he may not fear will take you to provide and being fed for us to live the work of God. God bless you so grateful and God bless you. Thanks so much. [Applause] Amen. Just a round of applause for the pastor. We thank him for leaving all his uh occupation. He was was very busy when I spoke to him. But he say one is with a very very huge church which I I just look from look at from far. So let's just hear what are we I'm going to interpret for my father. Amen. Okay. Yeah, brother. You can play the video so that if he says something wrong, I don't interpret. [Music] I wish you happy birthday. Hallelujah. Let your let you be prosper. Let your home prosper and everything you are doing prosper in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. [Applause] Papa is Yeah, this are my parent, my father, and my mom. Uh my father, as I say, is a is a is a pastor. Uh for all the years, I grew up in a pastor's home. And he's not only a pastor, he's also a professor at the university. He teaches uh uh what um he's a road engineer as well. I think he has been uh uh in charge of uh the road and bridge department of the country for almost 30 years. So he has uh really uh raised us in the fear of the Lord in a way that sometimes people they think I'm a Christian but it's just the education I had. I was born to be a good man. I never smoked in my life. I never drank alcohol. I never defied myself with women. I have stayed a Christian until today. And I thank God for that. It's because of these parents that the Lord has given to me and now God has been so faithful in the ministry has given to me other parents that hold the fire of the gospel. So I thank God for pastor Kodima. Thank God for him being here and for all of you coming with him. I will give pastor Alan the honor to uh introduce Pastor Kima to the prophets. Amen. [Music] Now the service is for you to give to the pastor. It's up to you. Am I allowed to say even one thing? I know the pastor is tired. Then I say something for my friend Pastor David. One minute I will not go beyond that one. You know I'm a man of time. Amen. I would like just to say some few words to acknowledge uh this day that they call the golden. Amen. [Music] So years of life is not a small thing. May God bless you richly for the sacrifice for the commitment for everything you have done for the kingdom of God. Sometimes in tears and temptation in Christ all those things that you done have contributed to save a soul to heal somebody to restore somebody for this life you have like you said yourself part of most of it was consecrated to the Lord and today we are celebrating 50 years it is a milestone rejoice be happy let fear go away from You go as a David, as a bold man, no matter the golad that will stand before you, the Lord will give you strength to bring them all down. Like the prophet said, it is God that qualify the sometime we can feel that he's not the right man. But when God put you someplace, oh God, you are the right man. And I believe for these people that are here, they all testify to that that you are the right man for them and you are also the right man for us. You've been a blessing and it feels for me it's good to have met you because let me say personally when I was growing up in school they were calling me 48 memory because I was a smart alec until I meet you we sit we talk. I say this one is challenging me on that level. Hallelujah. Because you articulate so well that I go and I doubt all my intelligence. Amen. Until I want to better myself. So God bless you.

Amen. longer that we are thankful. Amen. You may be seated. God bless you. And happy birthday, pastor. Happy birthday. Amen. Amen. We will be together the Lord and we will never miss one another. Um, as I'm I said, we also have a pyramid. I don't know if you know about the pyramid. Brother Brenham, brother tells me time and again about the pyramid. build in the shape of the church. He he says the bread of Christ is made like a pyramid and I have noticed that many people do not know what it is but uh reading the books here of my prophet it tells me much about the pyramid and even he says is you will see your play your place in the pyramid. Amen. Amen. And I've realized that many people do not know their pyramid. Amen. Amen. So I've been going through that because brother Brennham even says about you that you'll find your place in the pyramid. Amen. Now, the pyramid was started back there. They tell us that Enoch Enoch, he didn't go around looking for the stones. The stones were already there. Amen. Amen. Amen. And now although today I'm not dwelling on that, I have just this part here because he tells me here the Lord he is no more. Amen. Amen. I'd rather read about two or three. He is no longer a mediator. His word says so. He is a king. Amen. Amen. Now let's read here a bit uh page 103. 103 my friend. Here is the book 103. 103. He is no more a mediator. That's why I realized that the people that are called Christians, most of them, I'm not talking about the the church of Christ they are residing outside that's why brother Brennham says you will see your place in the pyramid pyramid but then we should ask I'll come with the pastor we will follow what We are even told that the stones that were used for building were found right there. Then Enoch the seventh man. That's why we are in the seventh age. Uh I don't have this book now. Uh blasphemous names. I don't know how I will still use it. Blasphemous names. Blasphemous names. It speaks of the ages. Now, Enoch, the seventh man, he was the one responsible for that stature. Amen. Amen. Oh, it seems like [Music] somebody I I'm watching my wristwatch. It is just laying a foundation here. This is the end of time. [Music] Amen. Amen. Amen. Now I must read find this part here. Brother, I think before I start, you know where where I am, where I am going. Each one of those ages had that rock confession because pyramid was built up in ages. Amen. And that's why brother Brenham says the church is like a pyramid. The bride is like a pyramid. Now it says each one of this, this is page 18. Page 18, paragraph 13. Paragraph 13. Each one of these ages had that rock confession. Amen. Rock confession. This age came with a rock confession. The next age came with a rock confession because it speaks of the white rock inside the pyramid pyramid. Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. Now it says the white rock the foundation as brother Brennham says the foundation the in the book rapture rapture you find it in the foundation that is a rock white and then he says the cap Is that rock white rock? Amen. Amen. And now the church is built exactly like the bride. I will say because you have a church. You have the church and the bride. Now there's a part here. Let me read this a bit. That is page 103. Page 103. Paragraph 355. Paragraph 6 255. 255. Amen. He is no more a mediator. That is very important. Thank you Lord. He is no more a mediator. So as you see the people coming to church next time they are no more coming to church because there is no mediator brother says here he is no more a mediator. So that's why the people even today they don't know where they are going. They don't know whether they are coming or they come to church. Next time they are no longer they are somewhere else because the he is no longer a medium and then he says he is a king. Amen. Amen. Now the king a subject. Now you are the subject. Amen. Amen. Amen. Now I I read he is no more a mediator. Get it for me please if you can. Amen. That is 103 paragraph 25. Read it for me there. Same. But now he comes from here at this last last scene. He no more a mediator. He is king now. Amen. And what does he do if he's a king? He has to have subjects. And his subject is them that he has redeemed. And they cannot come before him until he takes his right rights of redemption. Shalom subject. Shalom is subject. Hallelujah. A subject is not a church goer. A subject. Did you do you know what is a sub subject? If you are a subject even tomorrow, even in eternity, you still be there. You are a subject. You are not a church god. Amen. Now today this is as we as I'm standing he is a king. Amen. I'm a follower of a king. All right. Amen. Now did you finish? Yes. Okay. Maybe let's pick up the second one before we continue. paragraph. You are responsible for this writing here. Page 122. This one. Okay, brother. What? What? What is What is this one? Yes. What is this? The 393. 393. Paragraph 393. The seven seals. The seven seal. Okay. Amen. Read it for us, my brother. It's saying page 574. It's saying we find that the the sixth seal has been open to us. We see it and we know that this seventh seal cannot be broke to the public until that hour arrive. So there is a public end as Amen. Now it is not open to the public. Churches are full of public. Amen. Amen. But now there's a bride of Christ. Amen. He is no more a mediator. Brother repeats this so that you should know Whether you are under kingship of the Lord Jesus Christ or you are public can come in out but now we are talking not about he is no more a mediator meaning you should know that if he is not a mediator to then what? Amen. Amen. They call him a lion and that is a king. Amen. Amen. Now he comes to be king. Uh, get it for me my brother. 107 paragraph uh 285. Paragraph 285. Right. Says, "Now he comes forth, step out from eternity back yonder off of the throne of the father where he said as an intercessor. Now he comes to be king to rule all nation with a rod of eye. That's it. Now, Abraham Abraham looking for a city. He knew that the city must have a king. He had to meet the king first. The reason you see people coming in the king. All right. Amen. Now they call him a lion, a king. From being a mediator, they call him king. What? And what else? Lion. Okay. Amen. Amen. A mediator. on his way to meet his subjects. Amen. Amen. When Abraham realized that I am a citizen of a city now must that city must have a king. And before I can settle in the sea, I must meet the king. As we are here all together, we are on our way to our home. Our home is a city. Our home is a city. Now, brother Brennan says, "Our home is also built like a city, not like like the pyramid. The bride also is built like a pyramid. That's my prophet. Amen. Amen. Now, let me read something quickly here. This is not my book. Oh, God bless you. Amen. Yeah, God bless you, sir. Uh, let's look at this. The sixth seal has been opened. We see it and we know that the seventh seal cannot be broken to the public. You know you have the public as we have the ch the church we have the bride. Amen. Amen. All right. Amen. Then it says and uh we know that this seventh seal can not be brought to the public. Exactly. Why the public? It is because we you will realize that some are in the pyramid. Amen. But we'll come down so that you can hear. Brother Bren, I'm saying this. We know that this seventh seal cannot be broke to the public. Exactly. M Amen. It's for the bride, for the citizens until that hour. Right. Amen. Now we used to to be called public but it separated when now hear that this seven seal that was not revealed to the public. was revealed to the bride. But I read something here. Uh the prophet says I will skip to one thing until next time we come to one part. Amen. and the seven seals. You have seven seals. But then here is something here. Seven seals. Seven seals. Seven flying angels. Angels. interpret and the seven you start with seven churches until you end up you look into the pyramid of the seventh man. That's why the church ages also comes with the seven messenger. Seven messenger. Brother Brenham says the church is shaped like a pyramid. So the whole thing is pyramid. The shape of pyramid. Then he tells you of a white stone in the pyramid. For again he told me that you I will know my place in the pyramid. Hallelujah. Amen. Okay. Amen. Now you have the pyramid of stone. You have the pyramid of angels. Amen. And you know about the the the birds that came flying seven fromity, you know, they came from the west. Amen. And getis chapter 3, chapter 6. Genesis. Yes. Genesis 2. Yes, sir. Genesis chapter 2 verse 8. And the Lord God planted a garden eastward in Eden. And there he put the man whom he had formed. In Egypt. In Eden. Where do you get east and west? And the Lord God planted a garden eastward in Eden. Then brother here says, "And then I went west to connect with the angel and came back to reveal it to the bride. The garden was eastward. That's why he tells you that east and west met east is angels as he said they came and picked him up. All right. Amen. My friend is Is that yours? Oh, God bless you, sir. East and west. He says, "I went west." Amen. To connect connect with that means from east he went west. Hallelujah. To meet with the angels. Amen. and came back east to preach to us from east. All right. Amen. Amen. We'll still find it. We'll still find it. Amen. And even when he met the angels, he met a notable one. [Applause] Then he comes and say the angel with the seventh. All right. Amen. This is not just a human gospel. There's angels here. Okay. In the pyramid. The whole thing ends up in the pyramid. Brother says, You will see or find your your place in the pyramidal things ends up there. But we'll come with the pyramid. What is the pyramid? Now before I I I close here, uh pyramid speaks straight to the end. Oh yeah, I forget about my book here. uh each one of those ages had that rock confession means every age can confess that white rock the the saints at each age the saints sleep waiting and waiting eating on on till till all ages. Now this stone brother Brandham will tell you Peter means little stone. Then he said to Peter, "Thou art a small stone or a little stone, and upon this little stone, I will build my church and the gates of Hes shall never." Amen. Amen. Amen. We we are not worshiping in a sandy church. No, but the rock of ages. I was in Malawi. We were walking alongside the lake. I was with two brothers. Now there were some boulders outside. I said to the brothers, "Brothers, do you see these boulders?" They said, "Yes." I said did you know that there was one time when the Lord Jesus was these boulders were also that's why we sing rock of left for me eternally. Amen. Amen. Now I read this each one of these ages had that rock started there in the pyramid. You know about the white rock in the pyramid. Amen. Amen. So each of these ages had that rock confession meaning they come and confess that they confess that rock the next age they come they confess the rock. So if there's no raw confession in that age that is not his because there's no confession they come and confess him. Amen. Another age they come and confess him. Oh my the saints are sleeping waiting and waiting are on uh till this age it is ages rocks white stones each and every the saints predestinated by God They come to confess that is Jesus. The next age they come Jesus. The next age they come Jesus confess the rock. Not only by saying Jesus but by receiving the revelation. Hallelujah. you without revelation you can't worship him you can pray churches but you can't worship the true ones they come to the rock and confess the rock when they live they live here comes the following to to confess the rock and leave. Here comes the third. First the rock, they leave until to the end. Amen. Let's go there. Amen. God bless you, sir. Amen. Amen. You can worship for thousand years. If you don't reach that rock, you haven't started. [Applause] Amen. Amen. This rock has a pool. This age it pulls this age. They are from one big rock coming together. Amen. Now that's why I said to this young man in Malawi, this rock was all was here. Every age we come to worship the rock. That is what the L the Lord has typed to do. In closing, it says uh each one of these ages had that rock confession. It doesn't say it has a rock. No. If there's no confession, then it's just a rock. But this one, Amen. rock confession, the saints are sleeping, waiting, waiting. See, until this age that soon the Holy Ghost called out from Christ will come and will seal up the church. You know when the entire thing has now h come together and been bought from Christ. Our God is a great God. He's a mighty God. Amen. All coming from him. That's why I told the brother you know. Should we go, brother? If we can go, coming back, you'll still find this. A real Christian, you can leave him and go. Come back after years. You will still find this rock. Amen. Amen. No politics, no nothing. Rock of ages left where you can hide yourself. No, no cockroach can enter there. No churchism can come. It's a rock. Amen. Amen. Now it says, "The rock, my brother." Amen. All right. Amen. Now I said young men you can come back. You'll still find this rock here. That's how we know Jesus today. People come and go but the people come and confess. [Music] Some come to tell you I was a proitarian man. I used to be in the message. He hasn't yet confessed the rock. Amen. Amen. Rock off. Yes. Amen. People come, they tell you, I used to go to that. I was also a church leader. I was also a message believer and then because if you were a message, you would still be a message because that is rock of ages. Amen. All right. Amen. She she was wondering Oh, sorry. Each one of these ages had that rock confession. The the saints are sleeping waiting and waiting waiting. See until age that soon. Hey, we can go on and on and on. This is the rock of ages. All right. Amen. Or I I'm afraid when I leave. Amen. Sometimes I live with somebody else. Rock. Now closing. It says the seal has been opened to us and we know that this seventh seal cannot be brought to the public. Amen. Amen. You know public is popular. Mhm. Amen. Then he goes to say along the way they can leave you. We have in the uh brother come in in the in the completion here now. Oh yeah I see it now. completion here. Now by the by grace of God all the mysteries of the six seals that have been sealed up we understand now here that is the seventh seal. Amen. You have the six seals now and then you have the seven one. Let's pass here, brother. Amen. Let's pass here. We we'll we'll we'll come back and look. Ah, brother. [Applause] So you regard me as a little broke as well. Amen. You know Peter means little rock. That's why the Lord Jesus he said thou art Peter meaning thou art a little and upon this little I will build my church. Now it's from that rock to the rock to the rock. Amen. Okay. Amen. So now it says h this Peter the stone. Do you remember how he confessed the Lord Jesus Christ? Even when he was persecuted, he said, "I shall not die like my." All right. Amen. That was a a real rock. You know, if you are a child of God, you are a rock, a small rock. Okay. Amen. Now it says here, brother, did I finish that that book? Okay, what I don't do uh I want to read perhaps the last thing it it it says now it skips to a pyramid. The pyramid we are told that The stones used to build a pyramid they they were found there. God had prepared the stones already. There was no chop chop chop. Amen. Amen. And now Enoch the seventh man found the stones there. the stones of rock of ages of ages to build that pyramid. And we're still coming with the pyramid. I want to read this. Maybe it will be the last one on the inside of that pyramid. Because the prophet of God says, Even your place, you shall find your place in the pyramid, not in the church. You can go to church and so that's something else. But if you are predestinated, you'll be found in the pyramid. You see the difference there. There's no falling away there. H once in there. Amen. Amen. You are like Abraham. You know Abraham since he was born until he started he recognized that there's a king and his ministry is to go to that king. He's go to the city. He knew that there was a city somewhere and he started to lead the saints to the city. Amen. Okay. Amen. We will come to that. But here it says uh I brother okay let me come to this now amen we'll come back to that now apart from the pyramid we have here brotherham introduced to me and you The flying, the flying interpretation that that is the book of seals. Amen. Because it says, I want you to notice what taken place. And if you listen to the tape, of what time is. You will notice that the angel Oh, now it's taking us to the angels, but it's also in the we see this angel also in the pyramid form. So, All things that are predestinated are found to be in the pyramid. I'm not talking about the the pyramid of stone. There is the pyramid flying angels angels. It all comes the church is also in the pyramid form. The angels came in the pyramid form. All is in the form of pyramid. But let's read this last one. And the angel also in the form of a pyramid. He started there as the pyramid of stones and they came at a steep the pyramid of angels until we come to the end. Now we see the angel was very notable. The rest of them just was seemed ordinary. This angel was a noted you know they have you have angels but there's a noted angel. You know of Christians or believers but then and the noted believers there's noted believers. You don't you don't have to ask somebody because they are noted a noted child of God. You don't have to study about you. It says is noted. Amen. All right. Amen. Amen. I finished this paragraph. We we are still talking about the pyramid. You will understand the next time you see the whole thing about the the pyramid pyramid. All right? Because it ends up like that. And brother says, "You will find your place." In the pyramid. Amen. Have you found your place? Hallelujah. In the pyramid. Pyramid. The children of God also the the bread is built in the shape of the pyramid. pyramid. Amen. The city is in the shape of the pyramid. So the whole thing fitly. You go to the place that was made for you special. You are here. You have a place already. The pool is coming from that place. Your position is pulling. All right. Amen. You are not go around looking for a place. It is already there. The angel was very notable. My mind is notable. Hallelujah. Amen. You can't go to to meet something you don't know. You going to a notable position a position place. Amen. You know where you are going. Hallelujah. That's why they won't tell me that tomorrow saying she has left the church. Then I will say yes she was in the church or he was in the church. There is no notable place for brother. Let me finish this p. Amen. You know it is impossible. for a child of God to fall off. It is because there's a notable one you are standing here. There's one in the pyramid the notable. Okay. Amen. The angel was very notable. The rest of them were ordinary. Amen. Amen. And uh in the constellation in the form of a pyramid I just read up to here in the form of a pyramid. The rock was not written. Hey brother, welcome. Amen. And the angels uh sorry some took me into that pyramid by themselves. That is brother Brenham. Now meaning that if he is taken in the pyramid that that would mean that the church is in the pyramid no longer a church the notable ones. You know if I come every time coming to the tabernacle I come to meet the new tables. Amen. Amen. You don't have to ask him. Are you still working right? He's a notable one. Amen. Some you have to ask. Are you still right? Are you all right? This pyramid came through the chambers chambers. I called brother here and and then he says but the headstone was still not there but the the place was there for the headstone he's coming the lastly here the angel was to my left would really be that last seventh angel. The seventh angel messenger noted the seventh angel. You know if you are in the message that's one part of you is supernatural. [Applause] That's why brother Brenham speaks about the seven se that was there before the foundation. We don't have a new seventh seal. No, it is the seventh seal. And he says the seventh seal was opened there before the foundation of Amen. Because you go back you find who who who who were we then? Yeah. Brothers we were there. The seals the prophet says were he were opened. He says the seventh seal that was opened before the foundation of the world. Now if you are not there then you are notable then you'll argue and say the seventh is not open because you were not there. But the notables, Amen. Amen. They were there. You know, brother Brenham says h everything that was created say it is temporal. Is temporal. That's why my body is temporal. But there's another man inside. [Applause] The notable one. He will he was born not to die. This one was born. But the insider is is notable and you go to the garden of Eden, he was [Applause] there. That's why you are not there. You will make arguments some when somebody speaks to you about but if you are there just only a will says uh the seventh angel if we were if you would count left to right him coming towards the east because we have to come to to to to this east and west. He says in east and west met it is along the way here that that is seventh and uh sorry somewhere they were crossed. Oh oh oh what is it? He was on my left. Who was there? Who was there? The seventh entry. the notable looking to him towards the west because actually angels their please where was their place that was their place that's why brother Brennham says I had to to connect with the angels message and come back and preach to you to the church this message. So to preach there uh to start the church to start the service there he had to go west and came back with the angels message and the ministry started there. That's why even today if when the seals were open he went west always is to bring east and west together. Amen. Amen. Amen brother that is not a church that is the the notable ones. Amen coming towards the east. Then he speak about there would be the last angel's message. Amen. You yourself did you know your your notable one. Amen. You'll see when you come to that uh east and west. together. Brother Brennham speaks about east and west together. All right. Amen. To he that day he preached that message from the east. Where where was the message was from the west? Amen. We'll come to that. I said uh the angel with great wings how he flew to me. Mhm. Amen. Then we would like to know what angel which angel. Now let me just finish here. That is this seventh seventh seal seventh seal seal. Amen. Why the the people say it's not revealed. Amen. Now what happened here brother? What is this seventh angel? Seventh here. I'm here, brother. What is this seal? Amen. And it said still it scratch. I don't see it. Well, still a notable. Still a notable. Amen. Oh, okay. But I'm finishing anyhow. Still a a notable. Amen. You know you yourself, you have something with you. Don't you have something with you? I have it. Amen. The notable one. You read in the Bible, especially the seven seals. Amen. It showed me the notable right till we meet to look at this and to see also that he says he is no longer a he is a king amen did not did not go to heaven to meet the king. He met the king. The Bible says he he met the king. So, brother Brenam says he to us the Lord Jesus he is no longer a mediator. That's why people come to they go they come. So now now but to the subject he is a king. Amen. We look at it. It is just like that we find out that Abraham met the king not the mediator. Amen. So the seed of Abraham, you will see next time that they met the king. Hallelujah. Do you know that we are a subject? You have church, church members, church goers. But you have amen. It is in the book. God has blessed us with the seventh angel messenger. Hallelujah. Amen.

When we reach 50, we still remaining with 20 years. uh remaining for the lifetime after that it's the battle as a a doctor physician I would like to help you saying this you you don't have to forget this it will help you the rest of your life sometimes you'll see people with wrinkles It's because they lack joy. The prophet said talking about it. It's a treat. When you come to church, you must be happy, joyful because after here going home, you be getting bad news from the family, getting bad news. And God has prepared a time when we come gather here to listen to the word. God changes our thoughts. He renew us. The renewal is here in the church. That's the pastor called him after seeing I heard that he was seeing him preaching at this age at this age. I can say that it was God who was here always going to thank the God for him. The secret of life it's around three things. That's what I'm going to tell you. Now in the pharmacy being a doctor I will tell you. Okay. I will I will communicate. You want to try? Okay. Pharmacy behind outside there. It's like a business here. I am a doctor. These are businesses. Do you know where there is a serpent on that cross? Which means when you take the medicine, you accept the death. There's a way that you can skip keep skip keep it. You must keep yourself today if you don't have money. You must know that you will die and you must be really conscious about it. The only thing that must keep you alive today is the word of God. information can help you. I said it because I have a great heart. Every morning when you wake up, [Music] never miss in your house. Um, oil olive oil. Okay. Thank you. [Music] Yeah, you can restart that last part. Never be in. You will never die of a stroke, never never flexible, tender. Yeah. Because that's what makes your veins to be flexible. Because you are always angry, nervous. You always have a frown face and that is making your nerves to be stiff. No, no, no, no, no, no. Hard. It's making your nerves to be hard. You nervousness of one day just nervousness of one day it makes minus two years of life that's why even when you get angry you must have some limit that's why when as Jesus actually gave us a treatment How many time must I forgive my brother who sinned against me? Say 77 * 7. Yeah. It mean you are not taking out of you those substance. Now those substance that you have released into your blood, you must be able after your anger to uh recover and and and all those substance go back to where they were. If your body does not recover those substances that you that's the cause of cancers. No, no, just come now. Pray, pray, pray. So you stop being uh angry and nervous every morning. Take two teaspoon of olive oil. when in the future when it will do good to you, send me an offering in Canada for that information. Second, always have a lemon. It's disconnect us from the Wi-Fi. Because everywhere there is magnetism, in the car, in the house, in your phone. Yeah. That the magnetism of those vibration destroy our kidneys. It destroy our hearts. It destroy our lungs. When you wake up in the morning, you reach the first thing remove and put your your feet on the ground. Discharge electric. What? Whatever. That's what kills you. Electric because our body is electrified. Do that every day. Two teasp two teaspoon of lemon extra. two teaspoon of olive oil, extra virgin, and a a teaspoon of uh uh apple cider vinegar. Mix it together every morning before you eat your bacon, before you drink your before you take anything. Drink it every day. It's going to like release your body, your your the circulatory system, all the kings on the earth. That's what they do in the morning. That's what you don't know. Take it every morning and you will live longer. Amen. Now I closing with a what they are giving you is to just remove fear in you. It's a very small story short story little story. There was a cat and a mouse because in this world that we live we are always uh fearful what is happening in America there there's this trouble of and everyone is under pressure now they are going back to track people in the things that they did in their they they take away from you permit and now the the fear is it's it's very violent and God gave us his word and his word it's an opium for us if you are not careful with what God has given here life will be very difficult you will be always crying. God did not create us to dominance. He created us to dominate every situ. And one day the mouse was scared of the cat. And every day the cat was making the mouse uh to fear. One day the cat was outside. The mouse stepped on the table and ate the food. And as the chief was drunk, the wine uh uh the wine spilled in the food and the mouse ate a bit of a food with wine inside and the the mouse was drunk. Because when you drink the wine, the wine stimulate you. the wine makes the same h effect effect like opium. E the opium make your senses do it remove remove and now the the mouse took the wine and he was so drunk excited he went to find the cat and he's looking where is the cat even the head when he saw that red every time I he runs away I ah the mouse come I'm waiting for if wine the mouse not to be to fear the church but the wine that we have taken now it's a new wine The wine of the world make us to fight. The people are punching one another because they drink. But when you take the new one, it's the wine that makes you to hug your brother. That's why we must always drink this word of God because the word of God has a strength to forgive our enemies. That was my short advice to share with you as a medical doctor and that will help you in life. I can come to you next year. If I arrange conventions, I don't know if you going to come. Amen. Amen.
