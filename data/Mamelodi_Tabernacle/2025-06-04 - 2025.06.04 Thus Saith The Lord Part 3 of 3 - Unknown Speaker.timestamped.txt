[0:01] [Music]
[0:30] And brother was
[0:33] there seen the man there. Amen. And he
[0:37] said, "You see Dborah was a judge. The
[0:40] Bible
[0:41] said and I said, "Pastor, we are talking
[0:44] about pastorship.
[0:48] Show me in the Bible.
[0:51] so that I can also ordain some
[0:54] sisters for that position.
[0:58] said, "Yeah, you know,
[1:00] Hannah came to the
[1:02] temple. When the child was
[1:05] born that that was Hana the prophet is
[1:10] there, she appeared only
[1:13] there. You've never heard of
[1:15] Hana. Show me the
[1:21] scripture." Amen.
[1:23] H the Samaritan
[1:25] woman, she also went into the
[1:28] village. Yeah. She said to the people,
[1:31] "Come and see." She was never
[1:35] ordained. Show me in the
[1:39] Bible where they ordained a a sister.
[1:48] Nowhere. In fact, the Lord Jesus
[1:52] was supposed to have female apostles.
[2:02] Apostle Mary Magdalene, apostles
[2:07] also. Amen. Now after
[2:10] that they left they
[2:14] went to to
[2:17] whatever then later in the
[2:20] evening this
[2:22] pastor phone the pastor who brought me
[2:25] who brought him to
[2:27] me said yeah now I have
[2:31] seen I I I mean I have seen the truth
[2:34] now about this brand of mines
[2:38] He says firstly,
[2:41] if you are going to continue with the
[2:43] the gospel,
[2:45] [Music]
[2:47] the people will leave
[2:50] you. Now I said,
[2:53] brother, bring him to the
[2:57] tabernacle. He he should say to you, the
[3:00] people will will leave you.
[3:03] You'll remain alone.
[3:09] like amen. So he has missed the point.
[3:16] Then he
[3:18] says h I've seen on this
[3:24] internet they they say bren this brenham
[3:29] he started well this brenham
[3:31] he started well preaching the the word
[3:36] But
[3:37] later they started to you know get
[3:40] puffed
[3:41] up and they started to talk about
[3:47] revelations. You see
[3:50] danger. So the brother phones me. I say
[3:54] to the brother,
[3:56] brother,
[3:59] [Applause]
[4:01] firstly, eh, there's even some DVDs
[4:05] today criticizing Peter, criticizing the
[4:07] Lord Jesus
[4:12] Christ. Now, do you mean now if Peter is
[4:16] being criticized now, we should forsake
[4:19] Peter?
[4:23] They say Peter was the culprit. Judas
[4:26] was the right man to do
[4:31] the Some say Jesus had a son with
[4:36] [Music]
[4:38] Magician. Now I
[4:40] say now do you do you think we should
[4:43] now drop the Lord Jesus
[4:47] Christ? He's been
[4:50] criticized and the very same the Bible
[4:54] says they stoned the
[4:58] prophets. And when I said to the
[5:02] man, oh, he says it is Paul who brought
[5:05] in this
[5:09] thing. You know the stoning of the
[5:11] prophets again.
[5:13] Now, stoning
[5:16] Paul for bringing the word of
[5:20] God. You see what I mean?
[5:24] Amen. Amen.
[5:27] Why
[5:29] then there's this man who came
[5:33] again just
[5:35] on I don't know brother the brother is
[5:37] here he remembers
[5:40] when I think it's two days back or so
[5:44] forth he wanted to go to Bible
[5:47] school he was saying he has hunger for
[5:51] God I said then you don't need Bible
[5:54] school you need
[5:58] God. Hunger for God means you need
[6:05] God. If you thirst after
[6:09] water, you don't go first to school to
[6:12] learn about
[6:17] water. So it's if it's for God, it's
[6:20] from
[6:23] God. Amen. It's Samuel who called
[6:27] out. I mean the wait called
[6:30] him. Now he went to the wrong
[6:34] place. Daddy, did you call
[6:37] me? Daddy said no. No, no, no,
[6:41] no. Go to
[6:44] sleep. The word
[6:46] [Music]
[6:48] comeswhere. You know today people they
[6:50] hear the message.
[6:59] So he came again until the father said,
[7:03] "My son, when you hear that word,
[7:08] say here am I lord."
[7:12] Amen. Amen.
[7:14] Then as long
[7:16] as he was going to the father back to
[7:19] and
[7:21] fro, the word never
[7:24] continued
[7:26] until he did the right
[7:30] thing. Then the word now spoke to
[7:35] him. Brother Brenham says you must have
[7:38] the right
[7:41] attitude. Amen. Say the right
[7:45] words. Believe the right
[7:49] word. God will communicate with
[7:52] [Music]
[7:54] you. Here is the secret. The word is in
[7:58] the
[8:01] right and the mind of
[8:05] Christ to know what he wants done with
[8:08] the word.
[8:12] mind in the
[8:16] bride. What the husband wants
[8:22] done, she does it in his
[8:26] name. She has thus said the Lord.
[8:32] That's why that's my theme.
[8:34] [Music]
[8:37] Thus said the Lord.
[8:39] [Music]
[8:41] Now this thus said the Lord,
[8:44] it doesn't mean
[8:46] to come and stand here and said thus
[8:48] said the Lord.
[8:51] The Lord had spoken
[8:54] already and the word is in the
[8:58] bride. That is what the Lord has
[9:02] said. Glory to
[9:03] [Applause]
[9:05] God. Amen.
[9:10] Amen. She has accepted
[9:13] the word from God.
[9:16] So that word in
[9:18] her says the Lord.
[9:24] Amen. Amen. You reject that word at your
[9:28] own peril.
[9:33] You reject it at your own peril because
[9:36] that is thus said
[9:41] Amen. She carries the blessing and the
[9:50] judgment. If you come to a true married
[9:54] wife, she will always
[9:57] say, "My husband,
[9:59] [Music]
[10:03] Amen. Amen.
[10:06] My husband has even taught me to not to
[10:08] do it this way.
[10:11] But as the head,
[10:15] he has
[10:17] injected his
[10:19] mind in the
[10:21] bride. Now the mind that was in the
[10:23] husband is now.
[10:25] [Music]
[10:29] The spoken
[10:31] word from the from the husband
[10:35] is fulfilled in
[10:40] the seed from the
[10:44] male produce when it is in the
[10:49] bride. The word from the
[10:52] male will be fulfilled in the bride.
[10:57] Glory to Jesus. Hallelujah. Amen.
[11:01] You see it will only fulfilled
[11:06] in a human being
[11:09] before it reaches the
[11:11] goal. It is fulfilled is just
[11:17] the word will be
[11:20] fulfilled. When the word finds the
[11:25] place and it's now a
[11:28] person now that is the fulfillment of
[11:31] the word of God.
[11:36] The brother was talking to
[11:39] me. We were talking. The Bible
[11:43] says I will give you pastors according
[11:45] to my heart.
[11:49] They shall feed you.
[11:52] with knowledge and understanding.
[11:56] So now I'm looking for a pastor.
[12:02] For me to find a
[12:05] pastor. I should find the
[12:08] one God spoke
[12:12] of. The one he he will feed
[12:17] me. Yeah, that is a fulfillment. Now
[12:22] then I can say to you I have found that
[12:24] pastor.
[12:30] That's why the Lord Jesus
[12:33] came and he has done something some
[12:36] things on the people.
[12:39] Amen. And they would go and
[12:43] say we have found him.
[12:49] Now they had findings with them.
[12:57] They were the
[13:01] founders. That's
[13:08] [Music]
[13:11] why you find him.
[13:16] And after he
[13:19] had found you,
[13:23] after he has found
[13:25] you, he found him.
[13:29] What? You find
[13:30] him when he is in
[13:35] you. And the prophet of God
[13:38] says when he is he is in
[13:41] you, he makes you a revelation.
[13:46] [Applause]
[13:48] And now you don't just look for a
[13:51] revelation. Now you become a
[13:57] revelation. And now thus said the Lord
[14:00] means now you don't go to the people and
[14:04] say h
[14:08] he says
[14:11] now that is he
[14:19] Amen. Amen.
[14:23] Is not is the wife now the bride.
[14:28] My husband
[14:31] says so in the garden of
[14:35] Eden that woman
[14:39] she was called Adam.
[14:43] She was not supposed to speak to that
[14:45] serpent.
[14:50] Amen. Amen.
[14:53] because she carried with her the word of
[14:55] the husband.
[15:00] God said before h she was
[15:06] delivered because before this wife was
[15:11] delivered because she came out of the
[15:15] man God
[15:17] said God
[15:20] already had given the rules to
[15:24] the
[15:26] wave. Then the husband, the wife carried
[15:29] the word.
[15:33] Amen.
[15:35] Thou shalt not eat from this. Thou shall
[15:37] eat from
[15:40] this. Amen. Amen. So they were
[15:44] both carriers of that word. Now,
[15:50] now before the word could could be
[15:55] fulfilled, there was a
[15:59] crossbreed. The serpent came
[16:03] in and said, "What did the Lord say?"
[16:12] Just like the today
[16:19] woman the interpretation that
[16:23] killed killed them spiritually.
[16:28] So
[16:29] let's let me try to wrap up
[16:33] here. Now here is the
[16:37] secret. The secret
[16:40] is now listen closely.
[16:46] You say uh brothers, you
[16:49] know, I'm longing for the word. I'm I'm
[16:52] hungering for the
[16:54] word. But hunger for the
[16:57] word. Now you must know the
[17:02] secret. Where the word
[17:09] is. You get what I mean?
[17:13] the word. If the word is in the bride
[17:17] [Music]
[17:20] and they go somewhere else for the
[17:22] wedding
[17:27] you because the
[17:31] way you know the rich man
[17:34] said Lord can you send
[17:38] somebody said to
[17:40] Abraham can you send somebody back
[17:46] uh to do the right
[17:48] thing to preach to him not to come the
[17:51] way my
[17:54] way
[17:56] and he said to
[17:58] him Moses is
[18:01] there and the
[18:03] prophets what you need is not
[18:06] here is
[18:13] If they can't believe it
[18:17] there, they can't believe it
[18:20] here because what you need from here is
[18:26] already. So the prophet says now the
[18:30] secret
[18:31] is they wait
[18:34] look they stood there by the doors of
[18:36] the temple.
[18:38] waiting for the
[18:41] Messiah. And in the womb of Mary,
[18:45] there was a development.
[18:49] Amen. There in the manger there,
[18:53] there was a little child
[18:55] there. The body of God.
[19:00] Amen. Amen. And there if you move some
[19:03] kilometers away
[19:04] there, there was a big temple
[19:08] there and there were
[19:11] priests and moving around there.
[19:15] Amen. Amen. H waiting for the
[19:20] Messiah. And the Bible says Mary had a
[19:25] secret and she pondered these things in
[19:28] her heart.
[19:31] and the Pharisees and the
[19:34] [Music]
[19:35] scribes and the doctors of
[19:39] divinity and professors and so forth and
[19:43] the
[19:45] scientists and
[19:48] the Amen. All of them they didn't know
[19:52] about the
[19:56] secret. Now
[19:58] today we don't know about the seventh
[20:01] seal
[20:04] secret which is something that the bride
[20:06] of
[20:07] [Music]
[20:09] Christ has
[20:13] and she
[20:17] pers. Amen.
[20:22] They don't know about the
[20:23] secret because Mary was just a poor
[20:26] woman
[20:30] there. Even said to the prophet,
[20:34] I think you came to the wrong person. I
[20:36] don't even know a husband. I'm just, you
[20:39] know, I'm just a girl like this. Amen.
[20:43] And there were some dignitaries around
[20:47] there. Professor of what? What?
[20:49] Professor of what? What? God never he
[20:52] will never go to such places.
[20:57] Amen. He will always come
[20:59] to the meek, the
[21:03] [Music]
[21:05] humble, the
[21:07] [Music]
[21:08] uneducated. Those the people looked
[21:13] down, unknown
[21:16] people, but only known to God.
[21:20] Now the secret is the word is in the
[21:26] bride and the mind of because she
[21:31] has then it is
[21:35] gramatized. So the the the Holy Spirit
[21:38] waters it until it's grown and serves
[21:41] its purpose.
[21:47] Now listen, no one can persuade them
[21:52] different. They have thus says the
[21:57] Lord. That's the only thing they
[22:02] know. Or they keep it
[22:06] still. They have thus the Lord or
[22:10] they'll keep still.
[22:13] They will do the works of
[22:15] God for it is himself in
[22:22] them. Now the prophet is not talking
[22:25] about now the word to the
[22:29] prophet to the
[22:33] brother. Amen. Amen.
[22:37] It's now not
[22:42] to it was a ministry
[22:48] of at the end of
[22:51] it. It's
[22:53] now
[22:56] and
[23:01] no laid the foundation.
[23:06] laid the word.
[23:08] Amen. And Rebecca came and the message
[23:12] picked up
[23:15] Rebecca for for
[23:17] Isaac as they wait picked up the bride
[23:20] in this day
[23:22] for
[23:25] Christ. Amen. So God bless you.
[23:31] I wish I should stop here.
[23:36] for to to be continued.
[23:41] Ain't you happy?
[23:45] Thus say,
[23:49] "Amen." Amen. You know, she talking
[23:52] about a vision no longer waiting for
[23:56] anything
[23:58] because she has
[24:01] it. beautiful man.
[24:04] What the angel
[24:06] did, the angel dropped the
[24:09] seed and Mary said, "Be it unto
[24:13] me." And the angel turn
[24:17] [Music]
[24:19] away. The seventh angel
[24:22] messenger came with a
[24:26] seed. Amen. Amen. He laid the seed.
[24:31] I was looking on a video.
[24:34] All right. It's so wonderful.
[24:38] Now these
[24:40] bears are female and male.
[24:46] Amen.
[24:47] Now the male
[24:52] uh he will come around. I think brother
[24:55] has seen
[24:57] it to dance around and so
[25:01] forth some kind of
[25:06] dances although it's not but some kind
[25:10] of
[25:12] dances to to wed the the
[25:17] woman and and the
[25:21] wife on on the branch
[25:24] there. Uh she's just monitoring,
[25:29] looking, turning
[25:33] and according to the
[25:36] tune and that one doing some things the
[25:39] [Music]
[25:41] husband. Amen. Amen. Then they tell you
[25:45] that the husband, the wife is pleased
[25:50] now and she will also do
[25:54] something to indicate to the husband
[25:57] [Music]
[25:58] that I accept your
[26:03] proposals.
[26:05] Amen. And so that is the Lord Jesus
[26:08] Christ.
[26:10] Amen. Amen. How you know he did things
[26:15] to the woman. This
[26:17] woman went to
[26:19] Calvary. While she was crying, he rose
[26:23] again. Amen. He brought power on the day
[26:26] of
[26:28] Pentecost. Amen. So, so the this woman
[26:31] was
[26:33] looking. Amen. And she has sent the way
[26:36] in the end
[26:38] time
[26:40] with Amen.
[26:42] Now she was watching
[26:45] this. How Rebecca was watching
[26:49] Ali, how Elaza prayed before
[26:53] Rebecca and God made her choice, his
[26:58] choice. And she was watching the conduct
[27:01] of
[27:03] Elaza. And he called her and said to
[27:06] her, "Will you go with this prophet?"
[27:10] He said
[27:12] yes. And they said,
[27:14] "Go and let your
[27:17] seed possess the gates of the
[27:22] enemies." Isn't he
[27:24] [Music]
[27:25] wonderful? So it is the same thing. The
[27:29] bride of Christ will possess the
[27:32] gates of their enemies. That is the
[27:36] third pool.
[27:38] The prophet says, "You have not yet seen
[27:42] all of
[27:43] it." He says, "When the squeeze
[27:46] comes, you will see the third
[27:49] pool in action."
[27:52] Amen. That's why they said
[27:55] to
[27:58] go, "When the enemy shall
[28:01] come, God will raise up
[28:05] a third pool.
[28:09] The third pool will ward off the enemy.
[28:14] Amen.
[28:17] God bless you.
[28:22] Glory. Glory. Hallelujah.
[28:26] [Music]
