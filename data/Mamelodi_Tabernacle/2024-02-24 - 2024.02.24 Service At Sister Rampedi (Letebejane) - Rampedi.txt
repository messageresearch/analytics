years back we were deons together now he's the pastor I'm a Deon I I always say he must take his position and I must remain then we are always fighting about that I think maybe one day I will overcome you but I respect him as my pastor too know all the pastors that way I respect them as the pastors may the Lord bless you all you see Pastor may the Lord bless them for the support amen amen okay you may be seated I I might say I I also know this family the r family that R used to work Bank high so originally I am from White bank so we will always meet at my mother's place and he will always visit my mother to go in fellowship with my mother and sister R will also visit my mother she became one of my sisters there so she knows my family in and out and his children also calls me because they know me from years back so so sister thank you for arranging this meeting so we will just go to the word what time is it yeah uh I don't know how long are we going to take but we will just read some few verses and maybe Fellowship over [Music] them would like us to read the book of Second Kings if we could read uh chapter 4 Second Kings 4 let's read from verse 8 uh [Music] uh maybe to 10 and it fell on a day that Elisha passed to shanam where was a great woman and she constrained him to eat bread and so it was that as often as he passed by he turned in thether to eat bread and she said unto her husband behold now I perceive that this is the holy man of God which passed by us continually let us make a little chamber I pray thee on the wall and let us set for him there a bed and a table and a stool and a Candlestick and it shall be when he cometh to us that he shall turn in thether and on verse 11 and it fell on a day that he came thether and he turned into the chamber and laid there up to verse 11 [Music] [Music] for okay let's just bow our heads and pray gracious Lord we are gathered here at our brother's house being invited heavenly father to come and fellowship Lord with the family at large so there is a purpose why we are here here and father we are here Lord because you wanted us to be here amen we can do anything we can eat and talk and enjoy but without your word your job won't be a complete one amen so we just read your word father we pray Lord that you engage us Lord to the purpose of our coming here so that Lord Almighty that could benefit our sister in the precious name of our Lord Jesus Christ we pray amen and amen you may be seated okay I have read the scripture in [Music] comparison with what H sister has done here the Bible speaks about a woman this woman had a man the man was old and this woman had no child and then this secret here was between Elisha and this woman why was Elisha frequenting the house of this woman and why did the woman say to the husband let us build something put bed there and a chair and a candle there was something burning in this woman now there was a p in Elisha but now Elish cannot just go there and expose what was in his heart it must come from the the woman itself and then this woman recognized that this is the man of God now let's leave that together and come to our sister Elizabeth here there's a py within her why is she consistently want a service in her house why [Music] so she kept on pushing for more than 3 years I mean she's every Sunday the service she hears the seron every Sunday why should we come here because she she she's at the service now it is it is because she wanted God to visit her home and then if she want God to visit her home now the question is are you God now that's what I want to to show you that you are God now your visitation here it's like Elijah when he visited that woman it was God visiting that woman you just saw a human being visiting that woman it was God visiting that woman now what was in that woman God saw it through Elish the man will wake up and go and plow he knew that is old enough he didn't have a son or or a child now he just satisfied it's how God want me to be but woman knew that if I could touch God God will do a miracle there will be Miracle with God she didn't just gave up no now if we continue verse 11 and it fell on a day that he came th and turned into the chamber and lay there now he came now he he will always go to that chamber so there was a day now he went into that chamber and laid there and he said to gazi his servant and he said call this shite and when he had called her she stood before him verse 13 says and he said unto him say now unto her behold thou has been careful for us with all this Care Now Elisha was not speaking directly to this woman no he was speaking toaz will speak to that man you see spoke to him then he spoke to me it was a thing like that now he didn't go directly to that woman and speak to that woman everything that he did he spoke to just like moseson so God will always speak to Moses and Moses will speak to Aon just like even in the church God will speak to the pastor the pastor will speak to the church you must remember that the church is the woman are we together okay let's continue we read verse 12 verse 13 says and he said unto him say now unto her behold thou has been careful for us with all this care what is to be done for thee would would has thou been spoken for for the king or to be to the captain of the host and she answered I dwell among mine I dwell among mine own people and he said what then is to be done for her and answered ver she had no child and her husband is old you see now there is the secret the secret is she had no child and she want a child but her husband is old are we together now that is why she invited the man of God so that the man of God could take care of her request all right that's what I want to speak about but I want to show you that the Bible say you are [Music] Gods your presence here brings God in this place and then the sister after your departure she will never be the same the thing that she was cing for she will receive if if it was the demon that was ping her that demon will never come back if there's something that she wanted she will receive it because God has entered a chamber are we together now the children of God according to the word of God they are Gods H they are gods in this manner they are they are the word potential God let me just find a word a place for you in the Book of John chapter 10 Book of John chapter 10 uh verse [Music] 30 you remember about our Lord Jesus Christ whereever he went then there is always a changes if he visited the house there'll be a change in that house remember he visited a certain house there was a prostitute and that prostitute took a very expensive oil and then and and smar his feet took her hair people were saying ah prostitute and that girl was no more the same remember he met the Samaritan women woman then she was never the same he met Mary and the one who who who lost a brother Lazarus sisters Martha and Mary after he left that house it was never the same where whereever whatever he touches was never the same now that thing now has been transferred to the church I will show you okay now John chapter 10 [Music] uh you see what he says he he says I and my father are one now in other words he says he he said he is God and then then the 31 then the Jews took up stones to again I mean stones again to Stone him just because he says I and my father are one remember the ministry if it doesn't come to a point where a a a man becomes God then it's not a finished Ministry it's not a complete Ministry you know almost every Sunday the service there the pastor tells us that God created all things the last thing that he created is man then when he created man says that is the completion yeah now the Min of the seven SE it's when man is C I'll show you right verse 32 then Jesus answered them okay 31 they took up Stone 32 Jesus answered them many good works have I showed you from my father for which of these Works do you Stone me the Jews answered him saying for a good work we Stone thee not but for the blasphemy and because that thou being a man make thyself God and Jesus answered them is it not written in your law I said ye are Gods can you read it in our language up to verse for yeah now in verse 35 it says if or in 348 Jesus answer them and it is not written in your law and said ye are Gods what makes them God is the word because in verse 35 says if you call them gods unto whom the word of God came and the scripture cannot be broken now the word of God comes into you and then what when it comes to you it generates itself destroys the old man when it destroys the old old man and then the the seed of God like what the Bible says says now the word of God is the seed and then that seed germinate within you and then when that seed germinate in you it builds another man that that that that that man is is of the divine nature and what that man is is is reaches the completion then when he is divine reach the completion of divine then God anoints or adopts him and when he adopts him that that man become God let me show you Jesus was born a man and then when he was born a man and then he was baptized by John when he was baptized by John the day was baptized by John Heaven opened the spirit descended in him and God adopt him and say this is my beloved now as we are Christians we are Sons and Daughters of God now Sons and Daughters of God in which way there is a the supernatural Son of God and there's a natural Son of [Music] God Christ is a son of God but a spiritual one Jesus is a Son of God but the natural one it's a body Jesus is a body where Christ comes and dwell when Christ comes and dwell in Jesus that makes him God now that very same Christ when he comes and dwell in you that makes you God together when the prophet says the word is now in the bride it means you are now the word in the beginning was the word the word was with God the word is God now if the word is God if the word is in is in the bride now this is the pride now this Pride God himself God himself is in the house together so you are God's visiting sister look let me read you something okay before I read that let me uh God visited Abraham God eloh but he was not in the spirit form it was a human being Abraham slaughtered the cow then God ate butter and bread he at but it was God visiting Abraham a human being being yourself visiting this house it brings changes in this house God visited Abraham after visiting Abraham then Abraham was never the same s was never the same situation around the house of Abraham was never the same Abraham could see things that he he didn't know about abah could see sod burning now you as the bride able to see able to see wrong things are happening are you together so now uh the other thing that I can I can quote I don't want to be long now you know when the Bible says without controversy you know that scripture first Timothy 3:16 it says without controversy great is the mystery of godliness it speaks about the mystery of godl it says it's a great one nowadays we were attending a funeral uh was with the elders I think it was Thursday we we we we saw it was myself and brother Manas who were looking the program then it says uh there are those who are in defense of what does it say brother it says defense of they say that defense defending the the ministry because the ministry has been diverted brother Bram didn't do this and this and this no I said in my heart how can you defend God look this is what happened there was a time when brother Bram was from a Pentecostal and then when he was in Pentecostal there was of course these media dresses you know you know them and then as time goes on then he preached the seven churches after the seven Church ages then he he went westwards met the Angels he came back you read this book my new ministry came with a new ministry that is the ministry of Angels the opening of The Seven Seals is the ministry of angels can you correct Angels correct angels look when when they were in the upper room they were at one Accord one Spirit the Holy Ghost will correct them if they are wrong wrong the ho Ghost came unto them because they one Spirit one Accord you can't correct that thing you can you cannot correct the Holy Ghost now immediately you want to correct the seventh seal seventh seal the seventh seal is God himself are trying to correct [Music] God are we together the seventh SE is third pool and then when the third pool when when when when when when Elohim visited Abraham it was de pool in Abraham's [Music] house it it was God in Abraham [Music] house when Abraham metc it was God meeing Abraham Abraham gave I mean gave of himself took MC and gave it to Abraham and Abraham took Abraham gave it to and they became one thing we together so now that's that's what the the thir pool is that's what the revelation of the seventh [Music] seed so when he okay now let's go to this one uh there was a woman called sister what what what sister R did it reminds me of that woman the like like I was mentioning the prophet [Music] Elisha there was something in the prophet Elisha which was in the shite woman and there was something in brother that was in [Music] Sister together there was something that was pulling brother Bram towards sister there was something that was pulling sister r towards the pastor because he will always P the pastor when are you coming to have a service what kind of service when are you coming for service should you come to the service you are at the service every Sunday why should we leave something in in now that's that's that's how it was with sister and then what happened he said says I looked I looked to sister and then he says the the first time it was ever performed on human being he's speaking about the third pool the third pool is when you speak things into existence are we together when you speak things into existence you know God created and God formed is two different things he created man in His image and then he formed Man Out of the Dust of the earth now when he created he spoke things into existence Let There Be Heaven and Earth there was Heaven and Earth now that's death pool you speak things into existence so now brother brother spoke squirels into existence that that is that that that is the third po so he says the it's the first time it was ever performed in on a human being he's speaking when when when it was on sister so then he said ask what you will God is going to give it to you so he said to this woman ask anything God is going to give it to you ask what you will then the woman said what do you mean then he said I'm saying ask anything your heart desires and it shall be produced right here now you see now why does brother Bram says it will be produced right here how does he know you you cannot go to a person ask anything now do now what if God doesn't do it unless if God has incarnated you it will be God speaking in you you yourself you never say to a person speak now we together that is why even Elisha said to that woman speak now what do you want until said she want a son ask anything your heart desires it shall be produced right here you will know that the Lord God Of Heaven answered and his scriptures are true now that was the first that that was the first he says my my first time with a new gift so the the third pool was a a new gift because God gave him that that new gift now my first time with the new gift first anointing I could hardly hear her she looked around we had been talking about right and then Ed looked around around and she said brother Bill my greatest desire is for the Salvation of my two boys God knew what he was going to ask God cannot ask you a question uh not knowing what you are going to say yeah so he continues and say ask anything you want to because God has given to me to give it to you whatever you want so now that that's how how it is [Music] now the word of God must come to the point where it create God in you and and when it creates God in you let's read John 6 when when it creates God in you then that that makes you an amature God now John chapter 6 from uh let's read from verse 62 uh up to 64 it says what if you shall see the son of man Ascend up where he was before it is the spirit that Quicken it the flesh profited nothing the words that I speak unto you they are spirit and they are life can we 63 yeah the verse 63 it it is the spirit that quickeneth the flesh profited nothing now the words that I speak unto you they are Spirit yeah right and they are alive do you understand the words they are Spirit now what is a spirit is a spirit that Quicken then what is to Quicken Quicken is to give life like for instance now we we are waiting for the rapture uh the Bible speaks about uh the the first Adam and the second Adam it says the first Adam was a living soul and the second Adam was a quickening spirit now a quickening spirit it's it's a spirit that will change your body you got a word and that word when it comes into you because it is life because the words are life like for instance I'll come I'll come back to that if you go to the book of Ephesians I'll come back to that one Ephesians chapter 1 uh verse 1 in explaining that this this is what happens the Bible says uh the children of God does not sin because the seed remains in them and we know that the seat is the word of God we together now if the we is is the seed of God now the Bible says the word is life now when Jesus Christ said if you don't eat my flesh and drink my blood it was a confusion but what it really meant was that to eat the flesh the flesh types the we and then the blood types the the spirit now the word is quickened by by by by the spirit because what is what he said in in John chapter 16 ver2 he said now I will send you a comforter then he will take from me and and and and and give to you you you yourself cannot explain it you yourself cannot understand it but I'll give you a spirit that will like I've opened up here Ephesians chapter 1 verse 17 says that the god of our Lord Jesus Christ the father of Glory may give unto you the spirit of wisdom and Revelation in the knowledge of him see amen yeah so what I'm trying to do here I'm trying to tell you that now you are a minor God now what makes you a minor God the revealed word in you makes you a minor God and then now I'm trying to say to Sister Elizabeth that you had a visitation from the minor God and then you had a visitation from the theop now the theop are Angelic bodies you are visited by Angels Abraham was visited by Angels so now you have visited you cannot you won't see them by your naked eye but is the life within them look we are waiting for the changing of our body isn't it how is our body going to change the word of God okay let me put it this way how did Mary gave birth to Jesus he received the word and when he received the we and then he believed the we and after believing the word and that word became blood in the then when it was a blood in the womb and then it created a being and then that being was a physical being which was Jesus the blood of God you have heard the word of God and when you believe the word of God and then what does it do within you it create a supernatural body when God descend descend to that Supernatural which is your theop that is your Supernatural body whever it goes light the devil cannot defeat that way that that body it's a body of light demons cannot that Bo because when they try to approach you they see the light that is in that are we together am so then those angels that have visited you it's just to be with you for some time to to boost the light that is in [Music] you so that you should stop rumbling you must know that there's light you you are the light you are the light you must sleep sleep I mean sleep well don't worry about any [Music] demon when there's a noise outside don't even worry the Bible says the angel of the Lord is encamping around you look when you pray you don't pray guessing you pray knowing that God you know that God knows you and you know look when I'm when I'm leaving this place I know that I'm going to reach my place I I won't drive doubting much die on the way when I sleep I don't sleep doubting that I might end up dead no I know that I'm the light myself whoever approaches me he approaches the light are we together so so uh you just say uh Shalom to to the uh to the angels sister they are here amen God bless you God bless you hallelujah hallelujah let's give the word of God another we going to just sing One Happy song and then after that song we will sing another worshipping song okay and then we will close close the
