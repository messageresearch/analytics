also that we we we could meet each other at the pastor's house brother Isaac over there I see the mother okay God bless you God bless you thanks okay so now we getting into the word let's go to the Book of Romans chapter 8 I begin with Verse 18 all the way to [Music] 23 Paul says this I consider that our present sufferings are not worth comparing with the glory that would be revealed in US the creation waits in eager expectation for the sons of God to be revealed for the creation was subjected to frustration not by its own choice but by the will of the one who subjected it in Hope [Music] that the creation itself would be liberated from its bondage to Decay and brought into the Glorious freedom of the children of [Music] God we know that whole creation has been groaning as in a Pains of a child bre right up to the present time only so but we ourselves who have the first fruits of the spirit grown inwardly as we wait eagerly for our adoption as Sons the Redemption of our bodies Lord Jesus our God and our [Music] King on this morning of your Resurrection we are here to serve you it is you that said in your word that man shall not leave by bread alone but by each and every word that shall proceed out of the mouth of God says that a gift is to know how to give how to Swift to stand aside and to leave God coming to the stage Lord we want that to be this morning a channel through which you will have to go through your people in order to meet up with somebody and to bless somebody anoint us and the translat as well as we waiting upon you for the glory of your name the name of the Lord Jesus Christ we have subray and ask amen amen you may have a seat and may the Lord bless you I just want to give out one more scripture in the Book of John chapter 16 verse 12 to 15 I have much more to say to you more than you can now bear but when he the spirit of truth comes he will guide true into all truth he will not he will not speak on his own he would speak only what he hears and he will tell you what is Yet to Come he will bring Glory To Me by taking from what is mine and making it known to you all that belongs to the father is mine that is why I S that spirit will take from what is mine and make it known to you okay this morning well I wanted to share subject that the Lord has placed up my heart I want to speak about the responsibility of the church in the last days and its Glory the responsibility that we have we as a church living in the last days and it Glory so that's responsibility the duty that we have depend upon the glory placed in Us by God yet the Bible says he that has received much and much will be required of that one you know that the Church of the last days God has bottled everything everything that was to be the glory of God everything that was to be God everything that God was you know in the last days it is spoken of Kos God had said that I will restore everything that the Palma worm the canker worm the loc has have destroyed and he says after that rest the former rain shall come as which is and after the restoration verse 28 of Joel chapter 2 the Bible says and after that I will pour out upon every flesh and brother says on verse 28 the word utilized over there is a k so which means the Church of the last days God has rained down upon the church everything he had in his economy thanks to the because of this Glory we have thanks to this Glory we have a responsibility amen amen okay now that's the reason why the Apostle Paul says here it says that we know that the present pains and sufferings shall not be comparable to the glory that shall be revealed in us so which means the children of God in the days that we living in they have God's glory which has come through the revelation of the word you know that throughout the ages God alled a portion of the word for each age and that portion of the the word had its glory in the days of Paul they had a portion of the word and it glory in the days of irus the same portion of the word and it Glory in the days of Paul a thunderbolt in the days ofus a thunder so as long as the church is moving forward God is also botling himself in God is Bing himself out he pours the word and the glory there but to the last days to the last days God has say the fullness of the word and th the fullness of the word has come with the glory of God in the church hallelujah hallelujah that's why Paul says that all the creational animals the trees everything created by God we see them under expectations they are expecting uh the glory of the last day hallelujah hallelujah they're waiting upon this church of the last day because of the glory poured upon the Church of the last it is the Deliverance of the entire creation Hallelujah do you want to say hallelujah you want to say glory to God do you want to say that we are living in that Glory yes but don't forget because of this Glory spoken of we have a duty a responsibility in John where we from reading the Lord says he speaks to his church the church that the church in the beginning composed of John Peter and others he looks at them he says I have I have so many things that I good sign you will not be able to Bear them responsility because it is a responsibility it says that the initial Church the early church could not bear could not stand the things that we are now carrying because of the glory we have today is so Grand to an extent that we have we possess everything that God is hallelujah hallelujah that's why all the creation animals elephant they are waiting on us do you know Brothers Abraham of was a great man but after his departure we see lions eating antelopes the creation was not delivered was not Moses came a great man of God with a gift of God but after his departure animals could devour each other even the Son of God the Lord Jesus when we see that the Lord Jesus Christ had the but after his departure animals we see animals devouring each other PA of all the an apostle of God he preached Paul preached he understood Paul understood that the entire creation of God is waiting what are they waiting for they're waiting for the Church of the last daysy amen somebody say Amen do you want to say Amen I'm happy to to to morning so we've got a responsibility now listen brother I am going to read some of the questions that brother asked he ask some questions here he says he asks a question what are we waiting for we as a church what are we waiting but everything that we have received as Glory the entire word angels are all around here now he asks so what are we waiting the second question can you please write it down he asks second question why are you here you left your homes coming here now ask the question why why that's a problem this is a responsibility do you [Applause] know today the church is kind of doging [Applause] going the church is forgetting the reason why God has sent them that's why brother ask the question in the message entitled adoption I preach it on the 2nd of May 196 145 and 146 okay so we're going to have to read over there okay well so why are we coming here want to ask yourself a question brother ask yourself a question that's brother asking why are we coming here you have to re why it is just like a woman a woman that finds a good husband a well of financially man everything now we ask a question to that woman you as a sister as a woman why are you in this marriage because we know there is a responsib I think you understand me so we have to ask that woman that same woman we have to ask why are you living this marriage why you should have stayed home with your parents you should have stayed with your parents why are you in this marriage so when you come to a marriage you don't only have to expect you must keep in mind marriage is a responsibility and a woman who knows the reason why she's getting married she must carry out her duties well in marriage so now the word asks you a question why are we coming here why the third question he says after what is the world groaning after what is the world groaning because we know that the world is groaning now we see a lion after antelop the Le eating devouring other crocodiles are eating AR but now asks the question why are they groaning suffering why so if we coming here we're coming to church it's all because we have a duty we have a responsibility to set the nature free ah amen hallelujah Hallelujah we don't come here just for the sake of singing not only to hear the word it's good everything we need but we coming here because we have a responsibil to deliver the nature in the future home even the Earth must be set free for this Earth to be delivered it's only waiting for us I just want the attention of somebody this morning when we come in here did you know that there are many people that are waiting on us and that is the responsibility I am going to read brother first of all the entire creation that is graning that is a lamenting they are waiting for us to deliver them to set them amen can I can can I fly loose can I go high okay another question brother ask again why is the atomic bomb hanging over there why Brothers we must to be very careful speaking of Russia it says a day because when brother saw a vision of a A procession before him in 1933 he saw a vision he saw seven Visions the first Vision the second to the seventh and he says the third Vision spoke of was cented on worldly world the politics I want show UND attention because question is being asked why are we coming here why is the nature groaning now in the third Vision says he saw three isms Nazism fascism and communism and he says the first Nazism were engulf communism in communism and when you shall see only the picture of Communism he heard a voice that admonished The Voice admonished to watch Russia watch Russ and keep your eye on the King of the North you know in the French when we say observe look it means study carefully see when you get to a place and somebody tells you observe it means to study the carefully so we have to study Russ we have to observe Russia and as we observe Russ only then we understand what and the second keep your eye on the king of North Russia it means something why do we have to keep an eye on King of so something must to be shown only laying my background for my preaching he says why atomic bomb are hanging over there it's a question why and the answer it is in the word it is in order to destroy the [Music] worlden amen why do we have bombs hanging the answer is to destroy the Earth says that Russia has got a bomb to destroy the United States and the entire world so then why are we coming here it's only because this it's because this Earth would be destroyed and us we are Dy about to go [Music] somewhere we on our way somewhere hallelujah hallelujah now the last question is asking the last question what time is it what time is it now that's why he say now we might take a little bit of we might take a little bit of time and we will stop well the first question he goes back to that again why are you here in this meeting what is the purpose we coming here there should be a reason why we're coming here now what is the purpose what is the world groaning for why is the atomic bomb hanging on why is it that the molecules and atoms what is it about let's go to Romans 8 just a few minutes what are they waiting for when you read Romans chapter 8 where it's all about creation question they waiting for it hallelujah hallelujah it is such a responsibility Brothers he continues he says what are they waiting for all these things what are they waiting for everything the atomic bombs the creation everything that we can see what what are they waiting for what are they waiting for what time is it Romans beginning ver begin 19 well okay now let me get another quotation I just wanted to support the idea that I gave on these are questions that the prophet is asking why why the same preaching paragraph 158 he says this now listen he says everything is expecting but what why isn't the bomb striking we we have to know why Russia does not have the trigger but the angel possesses the trigger it says it's just like a lot in the days of Sodom fire that was to destroy Sodom did not depend it depended on the angel of the but the angel could not to rain down fire of but as long as was there lot had to leave the angel may be able to the same thing when we hearing about Ric bombs every why are they not it's only because we are still but the days we leave the Earth will in that's why when we ask question why are we coming here we are here in order to get ready for the departure hallelujah hallelujah and that is the duty the responsibility we coming to church in order to get ready for the departure one day we shall leave the Earth we will be gone what we need to have faith we need to have faith in order to [Music] [Applause] go I'm trying to wake you up you sleeping people we are coming here in order to go somewhere you know that Moses of old before leaving Egypt when he went about sounding the trumpet all the Israelites all Israelites that every everyone that after hearing the sounding of the trumpet come together to because they at they needed Faith from in order to go and everybody outside of Goen they were in a danger so they had to be close to Moses so now why are we coming here we coming into Christ for our departure hallelujah hallelujah and that's that's exactly what the the the creation is waiting for that's what the boms atomic bomb is waiting for hallelujah hallelujah continues oh I like this are you happy to to morning are you happy so why are we here listen to what he says again that everything is under expect what is the creation waiting for the creation wa is waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God she's waiting for the church to be in its position the creation as soon as the church retrieves the as soon as the church understands what she is that when she understand that the nature is waiting on her for the Deliverance it shall be such a Revival will sweep over the and that Revival will reach even animals the Revival of the Bride that shall come through the seven it's such an awesome not only for the healing of the sick not only for the raising up not only for changing our bodies but that Revival will put an end to Lion to eating from eat devouring our animals hallelujah hallelujah as soon as we have that kind of Revival and that the bride will have their position the communion will it R amongst the children of God says a time will it be whereby we won't even have to pray over only the atmosphere of Love That shall be in the church as soon as a person goes into the church the atmosphere only brings the healing hallelujah hallelujah but don't you ever forget animals the creation of God they're also waiting for that Revival that day an antelope can Li up oh glory to God praise God from now on a lion will never Devour the lion in we live together it shall be the beginning of millenum Hallelujah Hallelujah that's why Brothers things that we talking about I am I feel the Praises of the angel I feel the Praises of heaven right here hallelujah I tell you Brothers what you feel right here now can catch the vision if you can catch the atmosphere descending by the spoken words it can change your situation wherever you are you may be sick but the word that I bring has a power to change your situation and the word that I has a power to change your situation because the word that I minister are not only lers only but the word that I this is the Christ himself hallelujah hallelujah because of Christ Christ today he is the word made flesh you know say Myer brother Bram say that the Christ is a mystery Christ was a mystery throughout the ages so they could not be able to see Christ he was then a mystery he was a hidden he was veiled but today Christ became the Revelation hallelujah hallelujah that's why brother preach the message Christ God's mystery the mystery of God revealed now now we can see Christ because Christ is no longer veiled throughout the ages he was availed throughout the ages he was availed but after the seventh the master the Mighty God unveil but don't forget this we have a responsibility look the nature the creation is waiting antop are waiting for you you know Brothers I'm trying to awaken the conscience of the church there was someone in the Bible by the name of gon he was a mighty man but without knowing it he was a mighty warrior not knowing it now he was there H he was there complaining if for God to be with us where are all the wers if for God to be with us where are the works the angel looks at the Gideon he the angel wondering he does not understand he does not see the glory in him the angel says I have to descend so the angel descended but notice that the angel brought nothing with him the angel only brought the message of Revival to G to say unto Gideon you have things in you g what what do you have in your in you you a mighty warrior in you in you there's power you can deliver Israel one as small as I am can I the angel said yes just understand who you are and I am here this morning to speak to the Bride of M in you the power in you toer that is the responsibility we have so we have to understand it and that's the reason why we come to church listen Brothers often times I say to people I don't like pleasing people but I want to be honest with people tell the truth if if in you as you're there you cannot experience the power of healing don't you ever speak of the ruptur in faith why because the healing faith is so tiny but the rupturing Faith so huge it has to change your body it has to change your body and get I'm not joking that is a responsibility and that's why we are here as soon as a person understands this he will no longer go after women why because you've got a responsibility if somebody understands this he want to be womanizer or in the the PBS or Tavern responsibil why because they have the responsibility you know a pilot that carries in the in got a responsibility it's got people's Souls and as it goes about the piloting he must to be so careful why because he got a responsibility if we too could get to a point of understanding that the world even the entire South afria if South Africa still brething it's only because the bride is still on Earth as soon as we go it will be over [Applause] amen blessed be God we have the responsibility listen I want to single out something Abraham of old got visited by God under the chains of memory here comes the god to Abraham paying a visit Abraham says it to Sarah go back to the kitchen get ready we've got a great visit today I bring milk that was for the very first diet that God the very first time for God to eat his own creation why because he assumed human flesh now listen as soon as Abraham receed the revelation of God God unfolding the Hidden Mysteries to Abraham as you see I am on my way to destroy I am here to destroy s shall I hide something from Abraham is my [Music] friend now listen Abraham hearing the the revelation of the Mysteries he did not fold his arm to the contrary he interceded for salvation of his own [Applause] brother the responsibility fire shall destroy the Earth but you are in the position of ab you have received the revelation of the mystery but your brothers are wallowing in the Sin they are in the inations you have to intercede for Abraham said oh God should you get to Sodom and find the 50 righteous will you destroy the righteous and the Wicked the Lord said no I will not Abraham being a prophet he looks again he looks again in Sodom he doesn't see 50 rightous he goes down to 20 Lord should you find 20 will you destroy the Lord said no I will not where am I getting you says soon as you receive the Revelation you won't close your mou you will report it to others come to see Jesus come and see Jesus come to my Lord come and see Jesus come to see Jesus hallelujah hallelujah you know brother speaks of the Samaritan woman when she met to Christ she did not keep quiet she could not she could not help you know says shame on you sh you that are listening to the gospel three times when others never heard of The Gospel it is your responsibility hallelujah hallelujah we have such a glory right here we want the world to be attracted by we we are here for the departure we have to let others know that we are on our way there is a good land where there shall be no death where there shall be no de where there shall be no sickness Jesus has gone ahead to prepare tell the others hallelujah hallelujah how you feeling good let's move on now I am going very slowly one step at a time touching the of my message says all them people are waiting for the bride to get her position amen now listen to what he says says that they de in Christ they crying to God crying out to God lord still for us to go back on we need Resurrection this is what Paul say that the entire creation groans like in a in a birth of pain but they're waiting for the manifestations of the sons of God the adoption now I am going to touch on this even in the nature within the nature a true father does not just adopt any child it is true that you belong to him by birth but you only get adopted through character hallelujah hallelujah because adoption takes you out of the portion out of the inheritance that's why the adoption of the church today we are Beyond Divine Healing we are be Beyond laying on on we are Beyond everything that happened throughout the church because the church has grown the church has understood the responsibility when the child in a home understand that I after that after my father next in line is me so when the child understand that after my father is me I father when the father accept him this child he's well well with a good character so whatever I possess I have to his adoption depends on his character which our adoption depends on our character because when the father looks at hallelujah hallelujah that's why the responsibility of the church living the last days depends on that Glory that the glory of the adoption whereby God RS down on the church everything that he had as I said even the dead in Christ Paul Paul for example group and his group irus grou with his people through all the ages says day and night they cry out to God lord lord we want to go back lord we want to go back lord we want to go back but God says you for you to go back on the earth it does not depend on me as God but it depends on the church living in the last days you see the kind of responsibility to deliver the nature to unleash the resurrection of the Dead in Christ God is waiting on us now let's read brother Bram what was the Holy Spirit given for that's why I asked you a question of why we coming here the reason is for the dead in Christ to come back to life for the nature to be delivered it's not nothing it's not a little something they are waiting on us as soon as the church understand we're will to put an end to distraction to absent mindedness we have to dedicate ourselves for the cause then people are waiting on us that's brother if I can help somebody out this morning to be such a good thing listen to what problem says in the message what was the Holy Spirit G given for why what the Holy Spirit quation 50 to 51 I wonder if the version would be the same as in English I'm not going to be lengthy uh at uh at 12:30 but my message is a message of awareness of why we coming here what are we waiting for why do we have atomic bombs that's a a message of Revival it's the same holy spirit that save the lutherans that sanctify the method thatti the Pentecostals the same is here now in order to get ready the coming of the Lord Jesus the Same Holy Spirit but over there he was still [Music] weak it's just like a this glass of water F this a glass of field as soon as long as I keep it drinking it kind of getting decanted it's such a message of Revival why are we coming here what are we waiting for what is the nature Waiting For What are the in Christ that the same holy spirit that save the lutherans the very same that Sanctified Methodist the very same holy spirit that baptized the pente the same is here getting ready the coming of the Lord Jesus so now I want now I want you to follow carefully the next when it be so powerful this is how it is in the English so plain when it be so powerful the same holy spirit that saved all there that sanctify them got them baptized with when he comes in our midst when he comes in the Church of the last day this the church that has got the grand has got the huge Glory it be so powerful when that will be so powerful amen so today's holy spirit it's not the same as in the days of Luther it's not the same as in the days of Paul it's not the same in in the ages today powerful today the Holy Spirit must be so powerful today's Holy Spirit such a huge Glory because it is written who has seen that church in it a former glory so how do you see it now because the glory the glory to the shall be so Grand than the glory of the early church continues say as soon as you see the Holy Spirit becoming so powerful when it shall be so powerful this body yes that which means the Church of the last days this body will come into this group a church that will drove the rest the rest of them from the grave you understand [Applause] me who is going to get others from the angels will not descend it's not Jesus not even Jesus is you the church you are the one the Holy Ghost the in you powerful that's why says that if is no power is there's no power even for healing you don't have sufficient power to drive out the fever from you your child will be sick at 11:00 p.m. instead of you praying over your child you take the phone then you get your smartone P pastor Pastor come here dear Pastor my child my you believe in God you you believe God in you the power in pres hallelujah hallelujah H oh [Applause] yes lift him up out of History you have to experiment God our Father as you can see is tired the the weight of the age get him tired all the time pastor pastor Pastor no you are the Christmas man you are the Son of God you believe the word speak the word hallelujah hallelujah no the day of the Rapture the pastor will go alone you alone the deacons will be on their own the elders one one one by one you have to experience you have to be sure that as soon as the rup happen I will make it to God see that's why brother say I am I am speaking to individuals if you cannot see the power the healing power the faith for healing in your life if you don't see that don't you ever speak of the rupturing Faith what you need is to to have your personal experience with God you know Moses uh before uh his journey to when he meet God he came across God he say have nothing to go to Egypt have nothing I have nothing to take to PHA is a great manes but God said unto him what do you have in your hands Moses Moses says I have a stop and God says only with a stuff throw it down as soon as you threw it down Moses snake became a snake oh oh my Moses wanted to run away from his own stuff God say no you come back take take your buy the tail pick it up and he takes he picks snake by the table then Moses the trust the confidence of building up in in him with this I can and God says what do you have again your hand pull it out under your umed and take it out oh oh my li My Hands do not tremble before your head I put it back under your that is what gave Moses the Assurance to walk down to Egypt he says with this I know I can perform something it was not the later only with the Bible only Moses failed when he tried with the Bible only because the mother the mother's teaching it is you you are the one you that was a teaching the but he failed but when Moses got into a different dimension that was a personal experience then it worked when a child seek home not call the pastor call the Elder not even the ERS of the church to call Theon you put your hand in the name of Jesus when you see this happen your personal experience God working with you that will give you the Assurance of the departure hallelujah [Applause] hallelujah now dear brothers and sisters just I want I want us to leave aside the second-handed religion you need to have your personal experience with God many many times we we leaning on the experiences of brother brandham is a story that is a past your experience your own experience oh brother Creator squ it's good that's good you where is now now where is where is today but now I see you word is the same word spoken the word we have to let the history aside put the history aside Christianity is a personal [Applause] [Music] experience where you are so positive so sure let's go back to the reading let's go to the qu says that body that willome into this group a church that willj the rest of them from the grave there would be a resurrection that's what the Holy Ghost is for what is the Holy Ghost without us without us that without the ask the Church of the last days Paul Paul of old never come out from the grave Luther will never come out from the grave irus will never come out for them to leave the graveyard we and this is our responsibility continues he says without us they will never they will not be made perfect they Liv in one day we live in another day when the enemy comes in like a fly the spirit of God will raise his standard against it see 51 51 we we we are in another day back there were there wasn't half as smart as today even science Brothers it has evolved says in the days of my father my father they could be riding on Chariot but I in my I can drive my my my my my food my children go in a in a flight in the days tape they they use STS but now the smart pH but today we have [Music] smartphones science has evolved the church by the church science is moving forward today as you can see I might be here my my my car parked over there then remote control I just control it with my remote I can even started from here from a distance you see everything is moving forward evolving but what about the [Music] church says we have resources that we have not exploited [Music] yet responsility the responsib of the church living in the last days and its Glory we have a glory may we manifest That Glory now listen to brother says they couldn't uh they couldn't make an uh atomic bomb or automobile they didn't have science and things as we have now and things of mysterious things to try to say men are blow together by some D and so and to take some analysis and I tried to prove it to make infidels out of people one day in a in I preached at at the funeral of a propess of the university the professor of the university and abl man were there right before me iish the people and I told them you with your sence you are speaking of man's Evolution you say a man went from animals from dead pole to all the way to but let me ask you a question may you also prove the evolution of death how did it start yes okay let's believe that a man comes from a monkey but death where does it come from were they no one could voice out science cannot approve the evolution of death and I told them we all [Applause] dying we are dying today because all of us disobey the word in the beginning God say the day that thou shall eat of it that day you shall die and since death is the the chief consequence of Disobedience now science evolving what about the church this I'm speaking say it says but now when we need it the spirit of God raises a standard what is it he is pouring in his Spirit then those who are resting out yonder in the grave or under the altar of God as the scripture says are crying Lord how long [Applause] Lord how long Peter a Peter of old say Lord he also say the same Lord I'm to go back I have to go back in my body I have to assume my physical body Paul say God Paul of all the same say the same all all them people say cry they they they cried how long how long Lord how long Lord how long Lord how long how much long how much longer God is waiting on me and [Applause] you as them people are crying out Lord we want to go back on you assume human God said to them I am waiting on the Church of the last [Music] day we are the ones God is waiting up on how long Lord how much longer Lord how much long is waiting on me brother the church is waiting on me and you God he looks at us the sleeping Church the sleeping churches are looking us what a huge responsibility we have it's just like home the mother looks at the Father the children they're also looking at the father what kind of responsibility the father has yes and here is a snake creeping into the house do you think that a woman as a wife has someon courage she would run with husband she run to the husband there's a snake the children everyone father the snake you father now what about the father where will he run to what are you waiting for you
