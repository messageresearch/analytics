[1:37:06] that the lord
[1:37:08] himself
[1:37:11] let us repeat it
[1:37:13] the lord
[1:37:15] himself
[1:37:18] not a prophet this time

[1:39:08] him
[1:39:10] you are waiting for him
[1:39:12] he will be a resident
[1:39:17] so you'll just be together

[1:42:01] now he met together with them
[1:42:05] and a cloud
[1:42:08] now always it was just a cloud a cloud
[1:42:12] but
[1:42:12] by revelation now
[1:42:15] when the prophet was sent
[1:42:18] then we realized that that cloud was the
[1:42:20] souls
[1:42:24] of those who were in the graves
[1:42:29] the bible says
[1:42:30] they came out
[1:42:33] but they are bodies
[1:42:35] because they are spirits
[1:42:38] picked up their bodies
[1:42:41] and they picked up their bodies
[1:42:44] imagine
[1:42:46] some have been their bodies have been in
[1:42:49] their graves for many many many many
[1:42:52] many countless years
[1:42:59] uh

[1:44:54] down the atomos
[1:44:57] the spirit

[1:45:05] people
[1:45:09] no
[1:45:11] the father
[1:45:12] because he said
[1:45:15] i am going back to my father
[1:45:19] meaning
[1:45:20] i am going back to where i was
[1:45:27] and the prophet says where he was he was
[1:45:31] light
[1:45:33] that's why when he met
[1:45:35] a
[1:45:36] soul
[1:45:39] and
[1:45:40] it was that light
[1:45:42] he was
[1:45:51] [Music]
[1:45:59] somebody cannot see the seventh seal
[1:46:04] we will look at it
[1:46:07] because
[1:46:09] the seventh seal
[1:46:12] is only for
[1:46:16] special for some other
[1:46:20] supernatural species
[1:46:26] amen amen because it says it finishes
[1:46:29] the time of all things
[1:46:33] but we will come to that if god allows
[1:46:39] now i'm just going to read a few things
[1:46:43] and
[1:46:44] we will
[1:46:45] because we still have to come back to
[1:46:48] gog and magog battle of armageddon to
[1:46:51] after this we must put them together
[1:46:58] we are building a supernatural
[1:47:01] apollo
[1:47:06] when all these are put together the
[1:47:08] river euphrates
[1:47:15] bethlehem again
[1:47:19] all these things
[1:47:20] when put together
[1:47:23] they make
[1:47:24] a supernatural apollo
[1:47:29] then it will take off
[1:47:35] now today i'll just take a few of this
[1:47:41] but we are continuing
[1:47:45] we were also looking at the things
[1:47:47] before the rapture

[1:48:51] are the same people who fought him in
[1:48:53] heaven
[1:48:54] [Applause]
[1:48:59] that's why
[1:49:00] uh
[1:49:01] they won the battle in heaven
[1:49:05] they are here
[1:49:07] to win to continue winning the better

[2:18:22] out
[2:18:26] the rupturing
[2:18:28] without death
[2:18:36] let me say something here i think you
[2:18:38] wonder
[2:18:40] is there a person in the world
[2:18:44] who is actually not preparing for his
[2:18:47] death
[2:18:52] you know people would
[2:18:53] make sure that
[2:18:55] there is insurance for this insurance
[2:18:59] i understand about your car yeah
[2:19:05] you prepare it for a crush
[2:19:12] and put it through the
[2:19:15] insurances and
[2:19:17] what what and
[2:19:19] all this
[2:19:20] because
[2:19:22] you know that
[2:19:24] the day is coming
[2:19:28] but the bride of christ
[2:19:33] is a person
[2:19:37] who she is not mindful
[2:19:41] of
[2:19:43] death
[2:19:45] [Music]
[2:19:47] amen
[2:19:49] you know some people here
[2:19:53] some because
[2:19:55] they know of somebody who was involved
[2:19:57] in witchcraft and so forth
[2:20:06] they believe that
[2:20:08] she will bewitch them
[2:20:10] because they don't believe that they are
[2:20:12] the children of god
[2:20:27] who is the boss
[2:20:30] [Applause]
[2:20:36] [Music]
[2:20:41] when they arrived there he knew that
[2:20:46] it is impossible for a human being to
[2:20:49] cross
[2:20:54] he knows that
[2:20:56] it is impossible for a man to fly out in
[2:20:59] a twinkling of an eye
[2:21:04] he knows what
[2:21:07] but he said
[2:21:09] i will be in your
[2:21:12] now if he is in you
[2:21:14] you do you don't need to prepare
[2:21:17] because
[2:21:19] the flight is already in
[2:21:22] [Applause]
[2:21:34] what are you supposed to prepare for
[2:21:36] because he said that day

[2:21:42] no
[2:21:42] you shall know
[2:21:44] that i am
[2:21:46] in you

[2:25:00] american in this country americans
[2:25:04] i i type i'm not in politics
[2:25:09] when trouble comes
[2:25:12] the first thing
[2:25:14] they want to know about the safety of
[2:25:16] their
[2:25:18] citizens
[2:25:20] [Music]
[2:25:30] the first thing they would want to know
[2:25:32] about their safety
[2:25:40] if they
[2:25:42] foresee any danger to their residents
[2:25:47] they come first for them
[2:26:02] what about god now
[2:26:19] the first thing
[2:26:21] he will think about
[2:26:24] is
[2:26:27] amen
[2:26:28] wife
[2:26:32] you know for
[2:26:35] a man
[2:26:38] a husband to arrive
[2:26:42] maybe he can try to protect his neighbor
[2:26:45] being attacked
[2:27:00] there he becomes
[2:27:20] foreign
[2:27:41] why that is his blood
[2:27:47] what about the about the blood of jesus
[2:27:53] when his children his wife
[2:27:57] especially
[2:27:58] his wife
[2:28:00] attacked
[2:28:02] me
[2:28:03] amen
[2:28:05] if you want to see the wrath of god
[2:28:10] you try to attack his children
[2:28:17] okay
[2:28:19] i'm closing here
[2:28:23] he talks about
[2:28:26] a rapture without death
[2:28:32] amen that's why we are saying behold i
[2:28:34] will send you elijah the prophet
[2:28:40] he will turn the hearts of the children
[2:28:43] back to their fathers
[2:28:51] his children should not remain
[2:28:53] fatherless
[2:28:54] [Music]
[2:28:58] rapturing
[2:28:59] or raptured without death
[2:29:06] i'm
[2:29:11] [Music]
[2:29:18] you see me my brother
[2:29:22] i don't even
[2:29:24] start talking about societies
[2:29:28] no
[2:29:29] i'm just on my way
[2:29:31] i'm going back home
[2:29:56] he had a special airport
[2:29:58] [Applause]
[2:30:03] no other person could take a flight from
[2:30:05] that airport
[2:30:10] so he just walked to the airport
[2:30:16] and elisha
[2:30:20] who knew the secret
[2:30:23] he followed him
[2:30:26] knowing that
[2:30:27] he would remain
[2:30:31] but he thought
[2:30:33] what the type of manner i will be
[2:30:38] remaining without the power of
[2:30:43] elijah amen
[2:30:47] that's why
[2:30:49] god took
[2:30:51] this prophet
[2:30:53] but there's some people
[2:30:58] with a supernatural mind
[2:31:04] when god took the prophet
[2:31:07] they thought
[2:31:10] how are we going to do it without
[2:31:22] if we don't have
[2:31:24] such power
[2:31:30] because if you talk about the power some
[2:31:32] people think about miracles
[2:31:38] we are talking about the power of god
[2:31:53] there are men here
[2:32:07] we arrived at a setting home
[2:32:11] and then we were told that there is
[2:32:13] something on the roof
[2:32:17] and they knew that
[2:32:20] the
[2:32:20] data from the neighbors
[2:32:29] about how big is the sound how what what
[2:32:32] is that he just climbed up
[2:32:40] i tell you i'm a witness to that
[2:32:42] [Music]
[2:32:44] you know he just started up the roof
[2:32:48] and he came back with something there
[2:32:53] without asking questions
[2:32:58] now this brother
[2:33:01] to because he is a child of god
[2:33:08] he doesn't fear anything
[2:33:11] if it is not god
[2:33:15] [Music]
[2:33:16] a child of god
[2:33:18] fear god
[2:33:19] [Applause]
[2:33:23] not that god is a terror to him
[2:33:28] body
[2:33:29] the greatness of god
[2:33:32] makes
[2:33:41] [Music]
[2:33:47] amen
[2:33:48] all things bright and beautiful
[2:33:52] all creatures great and small
[2:33:55] god made them all right
[2:33:57] so it humbles a worshiper
[2:34:02] when
[2:34:03] he sees the greatness of god
[2:34:07] it really humbles him
[2:34:10] that's why
[2:34:11] they even quit singing
[2:34:18] because of his greatness
[2:34:20] because those who have seen him
[2:34:24] do not sin
[2:34:27] they fear his greatness
[2:34:32] are you listening
[2:34:33] not that he will hurt them he will do
[2:34:36] something to them but his greatness
[2:34:39] he is worshipped by such
[2:34:48] these are the people who fear the god
[2:34:54] because of his glory
[2:34:57] his greatness
[2:35:00] amen amen
[2:35:02] all right
[2:35:04] i wonder

[2:42:51] try to plan for my defense
[2:42:59] anyhow
[2:43:06] already
[2:43:07] i believe we are sentenced to death
[2:43:11] [Music]
[2:43:49] what we are saying is
[2:43:54] when i was born
[2:43:59] i know my parents
[2:44:01] were trying to prepare
[2:44:04] for my future
[2:44:09] and now look how old am i
[2:44:14] and the very same
[2:44:16] people
[2:44:17] who are trying to plan for my future
[2:44:23] they are normal
[2:44:27] they were playing
[2:44:28] they were planning for me
[2:44:32] but they couldn't plan for themselves
[2:44:37] you see what is happening in life

[2:44:44] we must put him through this
[2:44:47] and through this
[2:44:49] so that yeah

[2:44:54] so that when we die
[2:44:56] he remains with this
[2:44:58] he remains with that
[2:45:00] and the same comes back to these ones
[2:45:04] now
[2:45:06] these ones who die
[2:45:08] then these ones will continue
[2:45:10] they will also call their children
[2:45:13] yeah we want when we die
[2:45:15] we want you to take this
[2:45:18] then they die
[2:45:20] and those ones come again when we die
[2:45:36] you see how
[2:45:38] now that is not life
[2:45:41] life is christ
[2:45:44] [Applause]
[2:45:46] the bible says so
[2:45:48] he is our life
[2:45:53] even
[2:45:58] right now
