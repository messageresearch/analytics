Um I'm happy again &gt;&gt; to be under a ministry of a man. like my pastor. [Music] My my my spiritual father is not ashamed &gt;&gt; to call me his son. And then I'm I'm not also ashamed to call him my father &gt;&gt; and then I know he's in hospital but I believe everything is going well and our pastor has preached. He has preached everything. &gt;&gt; I don't think there is anything left which he has not preached about. When God allowed this disease to take over, sorry, when God allowed this disease to take over is because the pastor is finished. What I'm what I'm standing here to say is just to take from what he has preached and remind you about what he has already preached. There is nothing you I can preach about. In the message I'm going to preach here today, he has already preached about it. But I'm just going to remind you about that. Then while standing on our feet, I'm not going to be too long. As usual, &gt;&gt; I'm going to be short. Uh, &gt;&gt; let's read the book of Romans, chapter 8. We start from verse 17 to 18. Verse 17 and we skip, we read verse 28. 28. Romans chapter 8 from verse 17. And if children, then as as of God and join us with Christ, if so be that we suffer with him, that we may be also glorified together. For I reckon that the suffering of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us. Verse 28. And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, &gt;&gt; to them who are the called according to his purpose. &gt;&gt; For whom All right, let's close our eyes. My dearly father, humbly standing in your presence, we really say forgive us all our trespasses. &gt;&gt; Use my voice &gt;&gt; and my brother's voice here &gt;&gt; to convey your message to your children. &gt;&gt; I pray. Heavenly Father, In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You may take your seats. &gt;&gt; I'm just going to have just a small topic here. It says &gt;&gt; God ordained all your problems. [Music] If I can say he he has not ordained them before, I will be saying he is not infinite. [Music] And if he is infinite, he has ordained everything. Whatever happens to me, whatever happens to my pastor, God had ordained them before. What happened to the church here? God had ordained them before. then we know uh whatever happens to the child of God had a purpose in it. There is nothing which happened to the child of God which God doesn't have a purpose in it. Let me read something here. &gt;&gt; Is the book in this book the prophet says people they were thinking something about Jonah. [Music] Thinking that Jonah was out of the will of God. But Jonah was not out of the will of God. What was happening there? It was according to God's purpose. But to my eye and to each and everybody's eye. It seems Jonah was dodging the calling, but it was not so. It was pre-planned. that it must go like that. &gt;&gt; Let me read what the prophet is saying. &gt;&gt; Let's take a prophet again just a moment. Jonah Jonah &gt;&gt; I had first chapter of Jonah wrote down here Jonah came from the whale belly. was a sign. &gt;&gt; They worship God. They worship God of the sea. And their God was a whale. How many people tried to condemn Jonah? I always took up for Jonah. Jonah wasn't out of the will of the Lord. &gt;&gt; The footsteps of the Russians is ordered by the Lord. We want to say he is a Jonah. But let's take it. I know he was supposed to go to Nene. But God had him to take the ship to Are you listening? He was supposed to go to Nin. But God, but if you read from the Bible, you you you hear that Jonah decided he was afraid to go to need because he thought those people are hidden and those people are Gentiles and Gentiles are called docks. God cannot send me to Gentiles. God cannot send me to dock then let me take this. The prophet says God had him to take that ship to some sometimes things which happen we must give them chance so that can come so that God can himself come because if you see some dust going up then you get inside the dust. They will never see correctly. You must wait for the dust to go down when the dust has gone down. Then you must look then you'll see clearly what is happening there when decide to go to the prophet says here God had Jonah to take ship to It was not Jonah. It was God and he had the trouble to come up on the sea. Then we must believe that what is happening to our pastor there is is is God's purpose. It has God's purpose in it. We don't know that purpose. But we must not just rush. We must wait and see what the purpose of God. We must see the purpose of God unfolded and it will be unfolded. It will be unfolded one way or the other. We must not think But God had a purpose. Amen. &gt;&gt; He had the trouble to come up in the sea. That trouble in the sea caused by John not going to Nene going to Tarish. because the trouble for the people in the sea. But he said himself, Jonah said, &gt;&gt; "Tie my hands and feet. I am the one in trouble. I'm the one that caused it and threw him out." And a fish was swimming through the water. You see the purpose of God when they when they throw him the ship the fish was already there waiting for John because God knew the people Jonah was going to they their God was a fish. And if Jonah could come through the fish, they will respect Jonah &gt;&gt; because he came through their own God [Applause] and they will believe that this was sent to us by our God and they will listen to John because he came through their God. But if he would have just went there, they wouldn't have listened to him, perhaps they would have killed him. But because he came, let me read. Notice all people was out fishing, pulling their nets and things. After a while up come the sea god the way and rushing towards the bank. The ship was the fish was rushing towards the bank. Every everybody fell on their knees because their God was coming and they and God knows how to do things. Amen. Do you see God knows how to do things? Our minds are so limited. That's why God wants us to believe him, [Applause] not to try to reason things out. But to believe in God. God knows how to do things. And he got right to the bank and leaked out his tongue. That is the fish. And when he did, &gt;&gt; here come the prophet walking around out of the whale's mouth. [Applause] Because &gt;&gt; Jesus quoted this. &gt;&gt; He said, "As Jonah was in the belly of the fish, he had to be in that bailey because he he has to make that sign that the the Lord Jesus, he will be in the bail of the earth. He had to do that. But when he was doing that, it seems as if he was going out of the will of God. The prophet is God spit the prophet right out of the bank. You see, when the sheep was coming Yeah, they were they were inspired and then all that their God was coming. They were happy. Their gods were coming to us. There are people who love their God. But there are people who don't love this God of us. You see, when people go to sports, they wear different kinds of And you see they will never sit down. You see when they you see their champion even if they their team is is beaten. You see but you see people in the church but they say they love this God. Even when we were handing her or something with our dogs, when the hair gets out when the door rush, we also run after them. But we say sir sir satch catch catch. We don't just keep quiet. &gt;&gt; You must also say to me, "Catch him. Catch him. Catch him. No wonder &gt;&gt; they repented. &gt;&gt; See, God ordained your problems. He made them hard for you to solve them. He made them so hard. When you try to solve them, you fail, [Applause] he made them so hard so that he can come so that he can be the only one who can solve them. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; He He is a He is our God is a specialist. said this word. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Saying our God is a specialist. Specialist. &gt;&gt; I am also saying my God is a specialist. He he he he specialized in things which you cannot solve. Hallelujah. But if you try, he stand there and look at you. He says, I think of my wife of 22 years old. Taken just merely a girl. Sorry. Taken just merely a girl. A little mother there. When the papers give headlines here, [Music] a young mother just dies. &gt;&gt; How my heart bled. I didn't know what to do. But today I know it was all working for my good I didn't know but today I know I know the life had to be ground and twisted &gt;&gt; and squeezed. to get what it what in it was out. &gt;&gt; There was too much of brenam in there had to be squeezed out. But before God could make himself known, there was too much of you in you. God had to squeeze it out through trials. &gt;&gt; While that squeeze was coming on, it is hard. It is hard. But after a while, the skies clear back. Then you see the purpose of God. Then you cry, "I know my redeemer. At the last day he shall stand on the earth. Though the skin worms destroy these, yet in my flesh shall I see God." These little trials things are just for a moment. They will fade and pass away. But they are only done for your good. Let us remember that that God would get the glory. [Applause] He specializes in things that we cannot. When Moses was standing before Farah, Janice and Jambru imitating him in whatever he was doing. When he throw the stick down, they threw theirs down and they turned into serpent. But God didn't tell Moses that when you get there, you're going to find janies and jumbles. They are going to do exactly what they do. He didn't tell him like that. But what Moses know God said, "Oh, I have come down. I'm going to deliver them." He was going with the word of God of saying God is going to deliver these people. If these people can do what I can do, then I must wait for him. Amen. &gt;&gt; He was just looking at the snakes there in there. You see you you try to make Jimmy G. See born simple thing Moses seemed to be embarrassed. that was beyond his ability. But because our God is a specialist and he and and he specialized on things or things which we cannot we cannot do ourselves the snake of Moses. &gt;&gt; Just look at these two snakes and start to swallow them up. [Applause] I think Moses heart was championed. [Applause] &gt;&gt; After the Moses after the serpent of Moses swallowed those others nose, Moses took it by the the tail. To take a snake by the tail &gt;&gt; is dangerous. taking a stick by the tape. Yeah. Yeah. You are risking. You better try to hold it by the head. But not the snake. But not the When you said, hit you once. But Moses was told to do something which is difficult. You must take it by faith. You mustn't say I know this thing will hurt me. If I do like this, it will hurt me. No, no, no. God said, "Take it by the tail." Moses went then take it by the tail. It turned into a rod in Moses hand. Far and his group they were embarrassed. I think I believe Janis and Jambro they said to Farah where is our wrote where we going to get the rod back Moses where can [Music] they don't know this is my ro [Applause] I don't No, &gt;&gt; he made that problems hard for Moses so that Moses himself cannot solve them so that he God himself can come down and solve it himself. He he always loves that. &gt;&gt; Amen to come when things are difficult. &gt;&gt; You see there are people who love to preach something like this. Come to Christ. Everything will be all right. But let me see what the prophet says in this book. Through the scene, the Christian doesn't ask for easy things. There is so much promises today that are made among Christians. So many ministers [Music] promise the people false things. They say if you just come to Christ, all your troubles is settled. The prophet now says, &gt;&gt; I tell you, when you come to Christ, &gt;&gt; they then begin They tell you when you come to Christ everything all troubles have my prophet says I tell you when you come to Christ they then began that is when you put on a uniform and take be a gun and enter the battlefield. This Christian root is not a flowery bed of ease. My pastor used to say people thought when they get into Canaan into the promised land they will just find uh vine trees there. They will just sleep under divine tree then open their mouth then open their mouth then a grip just fall in the mouth and they will just chew. Next time they will just see the the honey bee and then the bee fall the honey falls into their mouth sleeping under the tree. It was not like that. They had to fight so that they can possess their land. It's not the flowery bed of it's not for cowards. [Applause] [Music] Cowards will complain and complain and complain. [Applause] It is a battle &gt;&gt; from the very hour you start until your spirit is set free by death. You are not at you are not at a picnic here. You are on a battleground. And so we are promised. &gt;&gt; We know what we preach &gt;&gt; because God has sent us the prophet. When things goes wrong, we must not preach wrong things. But we must say, "Fear not. [Applause] That that must be our message. &gt;&gt; Fear not. &gt;&gt; Let me read something inside here. I said I'm going to be short. &gt;&gt; Sometimes we have more troubles. when we become Christian than when we did when we were still sinners. &gt;&gt; It it but it is of course &gt;&gt; it is written. Many is the afflictions of the righteous. &gt;&gt; That is what is written. Amen. &gt;&gt; The word of God is a seed. &gt;&gt; It's not just written there for nothing. If it's said like that, the affliction of righteous must be many. Because God said so. Even if you can try to rub it or take out that page, But it is a seat. It is written. &gt;&gt; Many is the affliction of the Russians. But God delivered him from them all. God promised many afflictions. and strange feelings and strange things that we would it would be beyond our understanding. But it is always done for our good. We just can't understand it because if we did then it would not be of faith. We must not try to understand but we we must believe. Amen. When Satan comes like a flag our God promised he will raise the stand. [Applause] We mustn't try to understand. If we do that, we would go with understanding. We would go with understanding, not faith. But you must go with faith. But we do it. &gt;&gt; We have it. We believe by faith. with that is going to work some good things for us. If we could grasp that today on in this morning, if we could grasp that all of our troubles, there is none of us immune from them. to realize that those things are for our good. It is written in one scripture in the Bible that trials are brought upon us are more precious to us than gold itself. I believe now you you realize what the pastor has said. He said you cannot buy a clay p this side. You must let it go through the fireplace [Applause] then buy it at that site. But if you can buy it at this side our pastor he said you will regret yourself. You see dispute this one is I won't take this. No, leave them all. They must go through the fire and look them at that side. Then you can buy [Music] because the one which you said this is the next one it may fail the test. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; For is God giving us trials &gt;&gt; after we become his property, after our confession, after our baptism, our promise to walk in life for him. Then every trial that comes upon us is to is to perfect us for his glory, is to bring us to a place where God can make himself more real to us than he was before the trial. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. &gt;&gt; He also says this &gt;&gt; is our prophet. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let me read him in this book. He says, &gt;&gt; "But it is all with purpose." All right, let me stud it above there. He may commit you to death as he did Paul. He may commit you to suffering as he did Job. But that is his prerogative. He is sovereign. But it is all with a purpose. If he did not have a purpose, then he would be an author of frustration, not of peace. His purpose is that after we have suffered a while, we would be made perfect. would be made established, will be strengthened and will be settled. Today they see you woriing here. Now you are worshiping that side in that side because you are not settled. You are not established. [Music] If you are settled and established, [Music] nothing will move you. When things comes, they just strengthen you. You see a tree. When wind comes, when that tree is pliable, when when the tree when the wind goes that way, the wind will go this way. the tree will go this way when it will go that way. The more the more it it does that the the soil there get soft then the the roots go down is the more the roots go down. [Applause] You think the tree is suffering. [Applause] But this [Applause] [Music] you see he himself suffered. &gt;&gt; He learned obedience by the things he suffered. man. He He was actually made perfect by things that he suffered. He said in the book of Hebrews 5:8, "Though he was a son, yet he he learned obedience. by the things which he suffered. And being made perfect, he became the author of eternal salvation and to all them that obey him. In a plain language, [Music] the very character of Jesus was perfected by suffering. And according to Paul, he has left his church a measure of suffering that they too by by their faith in God while suffering for him. Sorry. While suffering for him, come to a place of perfection. Amen. &gt;&gt; He says here, &gt;&gt; where does he stand by? &gt;&gt; Why does he stand by? &gt;&gt; Why does why does he leave people get inside the suffering? The reason is in Romans chapter 8 verse 17 to 187 to 18. We must suffer with him so that we can rule with him. If we don't suffer with him, then we'll never rule with him. Amen. &gt;&gt; Unless we suffer with him, we cannot reign with him. To suffer to reign. The reason for this is that character simply is never made without suffering. Character is a victory. &gt;&gt; It's not a gift. You cannot pray God give me character. You cannot pray God give me character fasting seven times. You will remain the same you are. Character is victory not the gift. A man without character can't reign because power apart from character &gt;&gt; is satanic. But power with character is fit to rule. &gt;&gt; Beautiful. You cannot rule without courage. You must have courage. &gt;&gt; Then you are fit to rule. &gt;&gt; That is what our prophet says. When the children of Israel here when they were facing that fire, the king telling them Why don't you bow down? &gt;&gt; They answered the king. &gt;&gt; Our God is able. &gt;&gt; They were leaning at the they relied on the ability of their God. When when they were thrown in that fire, the invisible becomes visible. Until the king said, I said, "Our God is a specialist. He specialist on things that you cannot where you cannot help yourself. God comes in there when they were in that dark hour when they were when they have already thrown into that fire. When their hopes were gone, when they fall in that fire, they found that this place is less than that we are. The king said, "Hi, we have how many people have we thrown in that day?" &gt;&gt; They said, "Four keep three king." He said, "But I see four and the other one is like the son of God." Because the invisible become visible. Now even the king could see sometimes they invisible because the Bible says our our angels encamped around us and we don't they are invisible but one day those angels will become visible when you are in trouble the invisible will be visible. &gt;&gt; I think a certain wish doctor, he was my neighbor. I think he was trying to bewish me at midnight when he tried to come in my house. He find me standing in there. He went back tomorrow in the morning. He said to me, "What was you doing there?" [Music] I say, "What?" And today at about 2 or 3, I said, "No, is my house this?" I I I've got all the right to move around the house at at any time whether night whether day when I want to go around I just go around but I wasn't there I was sleeping the invisible become Invisible that wish doctor. He specialized in things we cannot do. When there was no one to open the book when there was no one and to break the seals the rock. in heaven, on earth, under the earth. He himself &gt;&gt; open it. Amen. &gt;&gt; When there was no one, he himself was worthy and he took the book and break the sins. and he makes us worthy to receive that book. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not that we are intelligent or or perhap we live better than others. He made us to be worthy to receive that blue because he was the worthy one. Take that brew. and break the seals, the rock and bring it to us. And that's why we're happy today because he made us worthy. &gt;&gt; The seals will open for us. That's why we receive them. Amen. &gt;&gt; We don't have a problem when people are wondering. &gt;&gt; We are happy. Not long ago, a man said to me that the Roman Catholic Church had to be the true church as it had been true to what it believed all over the years and kept on growing. not changing. &gt;&gt; That isn't so so at all. any church with the government becking behind it and with its own cre which isn't the word of God at all with no manifest manifested ministry to cause the devil to get around it. If the the the manifested ministry cause the devil to come to attack, the devil attacked you because you have got something in you which is God. If God is not in you, why should Satan bought himself about you? When you start to grow, Satan and his demons, they will come. That's why he he does not bore himself in Catholics. He says here that was not a criterion. &gt;&gt; But when you think of that little group, whose members were sown as fed to lions, persecuted, driven from pillar to post. He had stayed true to the way. Now definitely from the definitely that would have to be God. Amen. How they survived their battle of faith and carried on still. That is a miracle. Amen. Why? Because God when Satan comes like a flood, God resist standard. When Satan say now I kill the oxlike creature, come on. and announces and gives them the spirit of of an ox, a sacrificing spirit. They all want to be killed. They all want to be persecuted. They don't step back. The more they are persecuted, they they all go there. And I was told by my my prophet that one soldier who was taking people to the arena will be fed by the lions. He repented on the way when going to the taking the people he also he said I am part of these people because the spirit in those people was not their own spirit. God has given them another spirit. God has raised the standard. When you feel pity for them when you feel pity for them But they were not feeling pity for one another. They were happy. [Applause] When you take one and throw him into the praise God, [Applause] &gt;&gt; he is a specialist. &gt;&gt; He just want us to believe. in his ability. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He is always there to act. That is the reason he said, "Fear not. All things are possible to them that believe. Everything work together for good. to those who love him, &gt;&gt; not to all to those who love him. Amen. &gt;&gt; All things work for good &gt;&gt; to those who are called &gt;&gt; according to his purpose. &gt;&gt; God bless you. on a short &gt;&gt; while my brother comes. God bless. [Music] [Applause] &gt;&gt; Holy angel. &gt;&gt; I'm a holy [Music] I'm a holy lady. [Music] Yeah. [Music] Holy. [Music] [Applause] [Music] I'm a holy. [Music] I'm a holy.

God who brings the word, the right word at the right time. [Applause] Now, I'm going to do something unusual now, but I've requested the pastor because it reminds me when the tabernacle of God was entering the temple in the temple. David rejoice. I care a lot. &gt;&gt; Amen. I want us to rejoice. &gt;&gt; I want us to celebrate &gt;&gt; because God has answered you. &gt;&gt; No more complaints. God is in control. Let's just celebrate for the moment. &gt;&gt; Then after that, we'll ask our brother to pray for us after the word. Amen. [Music] [Laughter] [Music] Oh god. [Music] So sh I sing my soul. Hallelujah.

I search all over and still find there is none like thee. When you do things, you do things. Oh, you know how to do things &gt;&gt; and that makes you a specialist. &gt;&gt; Thank you, Lord.

Oh God, &gt;&gt; all the afflictions actually you went through the worst. Oh God, &gt;&gt; and that made you to be to be the the Lord of Lots. &gt;&gt; The Bible when talks about you, it says when you ascended, you ascended high &gt;&gt; and when you went down, you went lower &gt;&gt; so that you can be the all in all. What a mighty God we serve. &gt;&gt; And you've made us your children. You've made us victors, oh God. &gt;&gt; Oh, my prayer is let this thought &gt;&gt; be with each and every son and daughter of God. When we move out of this place, we must know that there is a purpose &gt;&gt; in all the things that we go through. And the more there seems to be harder, it is for you to come and specialize. &gt;&gt; Oh God, you know where we are in our lives. And we invite you Lord to come and specialize.

Father, &gt;&gt; when things were impossible, &gt;&gt; you intervene, Lord, &gt;&gt; when people were complaining to Moses, &gt;&gt; saying, Moses, you brought us from Egypt &gt;&gt; where we had everything, &gt;&gt; but you have brought us here, &gt;&gt; and you make Moses to cross them over, Father. &gt;&gt; You opened that that sea. &gt;&gt; Father, we thank you today.

Father, as we go in the baptismal, Father, we believe that you'll enter in in this people &gt;&gt; that are going to be baptized today because they saying the very same word.

Therefore, let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God hath made that same Jesus, whom he have crucified, both Lord and Christ. Now when they heard this, they were pricricked in their heart, and said unto Peter, and to the rest of the apostles, "Men and brethren, what shall we do?" Then Peter said unto them,"Repent, and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ, for the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. For the promise is unto you and your children, and to all that are a far off, even as many as the Lord our God shall call. [Music] to the &gt;&gt; lamb. I know. [Music] Jose.
