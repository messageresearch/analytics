[0:14] There is no revelation. There's nothing
[0:16] you can do.
[0:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:19] &gt;&gt; Oh, right.
[0:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[0:22] &gt;&gt; Why? It is because in those days
[0:28] God didn't speak to the Pharisees.
[0:33] &gt;&gt; He would speak in Jesus
[0:36] and whilst they are looking up
[0:45] by the sun and being RAINED UPON. BUT
[0:47] JESUS, GOD WAS ON IT.
[0:53] So if you look up for a long time, you
[0:55] get a bit drowsy.
[1:00] They brought back their eyes.
[1:04] They say, "Don't bring yourself
[1:10] because
[1:13] the word says
[1:15] &gt;&gt; the word was made flesh."
[1:19] And we saw his glory. His glory
[1:25] and dwell among us.
[1:30] GOD WANTED TO TAKE HIMSELF A PICTURE
[1:32] WITH THE people
[1:34] dwelt among us.
[1:40] When you say TO THE MEN, WHERE IS GOD?
[1:45] &gt;&gt; God with us. EMMANUEL.
[1:48] &gt;&gt; EMMANUEL. GOD WITH US.
[1:51] AMEN.
[1:53] &gt;&gt; EMMANUEL,
[1:54] &gt;&gt; God with us.
[1:58] &gt;&gt; You could take a foot with God,
[2:03] &gt;&gt; but he was a man.
[2:07] Amen.
[2:10] &gt;&gt; All right.
[2:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12] Now,
[2:14] &gt;&gt; and
[2:16] in those days
[2:18] &gt;&gt; to the Jews,
[2:20] &gt;&gt; they would kick you out of a synagogue.
[2:24] &gt;&gt; If you said Jesus is the Christ,
[2:26] &gt;&gt; they will kick you out of the synagogue.
[2:32] &gt;&gt; If you say the church is Christ,
[2:35] &gt;&gt; they'll kick you out of the synagogue.
[2:40] brother for brother to say
[2:43] &gt;&gt; you are Christ
[2:46] they kick you out of synagogue
[2:50] &gt;&gt; but THAT IS GOD IS GOD SAYING
[2:54] BROTHER IS SAYING WHAT GOD said
[2:59] God doesn't ONLY SAY YOU ARE CHRIST I
[3:01] WILL be in you
[3:05] amen now if he is in you
[3:08] &gt;&gt; it's more than a picture.
[3:12] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[3:15] &gt;&gt; If somebody says
[3:18] um picture
[3:20] &gt;&gt; throw away that picture
[3:23] still
[3:25] the BEST HE HASN'T DONE ANYTHING
[3:31] it's in me.
[3:33] Amen.
[3:35] Amen. Now
[3:38] unbelievers are unbelievers
[3:43] WHO
[3:44] IN THEIR homes
[3:47] &gt;&gt; but actually
[3:49] GREATER PICTURE
[3:51] &gt;&gt; IS in the bride.
[3:55] Amen.
[3:56] &gt;&gt; Okay. Amen.
[3:59] We are showing the natural.
[4:04] Amen.
[4:05] &gt;&gt; Which even now I can pose.
[4:09] Amen.
[4:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:14] Amen.
[4:16] &gt;&gt; You see
[4:19] &gt;&gt; that one was taken by science.
[4:23] &gt;&gt; IT'S ON THE NATURAL SIDE.
[4:25] &gt;&gt; But the Lord Jesus says
[4:28] at that day
[4:30] &gt;&gt; greater than a scientific picture.
[4:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[4:39] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[4:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:42] &gt;&gt; I love this picture.
[4:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[4:47] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now the pro, it is the prophet
[4:51] who saw that picture
[4:54] and and said look at it.
[4:57] &gt;&gt; You see the eyes.
[4:59] Can you see the nose? If you have the
[5:02] color feeling
[5:06] &gt;&gt; and it says because it says it said men
[5:11] as you are gazing in heaven
[5:14] you see him going out up in a cloud. I I
[5:20] he will return just like this.
[5:24] Amen. Amen.
[5:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:27] &gt;&gt; And Thessalonians says,
[5:29] &gt;&gt; "We that are alive
[5:34] &gt;&gt; shall together
[5:37] be joined to those,
[5:40] &gt;&gt; the resurrected
[5:43] &gt;&gt; in the clouds."
[5:46] Amen.
[5:48] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[5:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[5:49] &gt;&gt; Now before we close,
[5:52] &gt;&gt; now here we are.
[5:54] &gt;&gt; Christ is the mystery of God revealed.
[5:59] &gt;&gt; Christ
[6:00] &gt;&gt; revealed.
[6:02] &gt;&gt; It doesn't say Jesus. Amen.
[6:05] &gt;&gt; Because Jesus is a man.
[6:08] &gt;&gt; Now Christ was in Jesus.
[6:12] Amen. Amen. Amen. Now you come here.
[6:17] E this is the sign of his coming.
[6:24] &gt;&gt; What took place here is
[6:28] there were seven angels.
[6:31] Seven angels came
[6:34] and
[6:35] they
[6:37] they pose a foot
[6:40] with brother Brenham. Amen. Amen.
[6:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:49] &gt;&gt; They post.
[6:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[6:54] &gt;&gt; They put him in the pyramid of
[6:56] themselves.
[6:59] Amen.
[7:00] &gt;&gt; Okay. Amen.
[7:02] &gt;&gt; Now, if brother was there,
[7:08] Amen.
[7:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. and the prophet
[7:11] is there
[7:13] &gt;&gt; to take a a photo.
[7:16] &gt;&gt; I think he wouldn't say to brotherh,
[7:22] I I won't allow you.
[7:30] I'm coming to something in closing.
[7:34] You listen. The trouble with the people,
[7:38] it's when
[7:41] Christ
[7:42] &gt;&gt; identified himself with the people.
[7:47] Amen.
[7:48] &gt;&gt; That was the trouble of the Jews.
[7:53] Amen. Amen. They wanted a God they could
[7:55] read about,
[7:59] not a manifested one. Because the
[8:02] manifested one is a man.
[8:07] Amen.
[8:09] &gt;&gt; The man, the manifested word
[8:12] &gt;&gt; is a man.
[8:14] Amen.
[8:15] &gt;&gt; The word was made
[8:17] &gt;&gt; flesh.
[8:20] And when when it was made flesh,
[8:23] we
[8:25] &gt;&gt; saw his glory.
[8:29] Amen.
[8:30] &gt;&gt; We saw the glory.
[8:32] When the word was made flesh,
[8:37] &gt;&gt; before the word was made flesh, we could
[8:40] only read.
[8:45] The Samaritan woman, she could only read
[8:48] about it. But when the word was made
[8:51] flesh, she could TALK TO THE WORD.
[8:55] AMEN. AMEN. She could talk to him. Now
[9:00] it was better than just reading
[9:04] because there's no with reading you can
[9:08] ask questions
[9:12] some come up with headaches out with
[9:15] headaches
[9:19] you know really confuses me
[9:23] but
[9:25] &gt;&gt; when he was ON THE SCENE
[9:28] &gt;&gt; the written and women can now put the
[9:31] Bible aside
[9:34] and now said
[9:38] amen.
[9:41] &gt;&gt; You see
[9:43] you can't read while he's here.
[9:52] &gt;&gt; Right. If you are going to Ptoria,
[9:56] &gt;&gt; you've got a map. So you follow
[10:08] GPS.
[10:09] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[10:09] &gt;&gt; GPS.
[10:10] &gt;&gt; GPS.
[10:18] You looking for the chicken, the corner
[10:21] of Victoria Street.
[10:24] Now it brings you there.
[10:32] If we see you looking still searching
[10:34] when you are there we think this person
[10:37] is sick.
[10:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:38] &gt;&gt; You know today
[10:44] we open the books for people and say
[10:48] who are you looking for?
[10:50] &gt;&gt; Jesus.
[10:52] &gt;&gt; Oh here he is.
[10:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[10:58] You know, people come there looking.
[11:00] They're looking
[11:02] here.
[11:03] &gt;&gt; But sometimes
[11:06] while still searching,
[11:09] &gt;&gt; now when we find a person who knows the
[11:11] place
[11:11] &gt;&gt; the best.
[11:17] &gt;&gt; So
[11:19] &gt;&gt; it is better when you find somebody, a
[11:23] person, a man who knows the place.
[11:29] Amen. Amen.
[11:30] &gt;&gt; Now, for you TO GO TO HEAVEN,
[11:33] THE BEST thing
[11:35] if you can find a man who knows WHERE
[11:39] HEAVEN IS.
[11:41] AMEN.
[11:42] &gt;&gt; YEAH. AMEN.
[11:44] &gt;&gt; All right. Amen.
[11:47] &gt;&gt; Because in reading
[11:50] some we understand, some we don't
[11:52] understand.
[11:55] in reading.
[12:00] Don't think that when people read they
[12:02] understand
[12:04] no
[12:07] men
[12:13] they met Jehovah's
[12:16] Jehovah witnesses to them
[12:18] they talking about the godhead
[12:21] now you want to tell that God
[12:26] was in Mary's womb
[12:28] Yes.
[12:35] The driver would close
[12:39] playing games, took his Bible and left.
[12:45] by so doing
[12:48] &gt;&gt; they think they revealing a mystery.
[12:52] &gt;&gt; But the Bible says
[12:55] the son of God. Amen.
[13:00] I tried to show another brother.
[13:02] When they asked him to pray,
[13:06] he said, "Thank you, Father Jesus.
[13:14] Where does the Bible say father?
[13:17] Because Jesus says,
[13:19] &gt;&gt; I go back to my father.
[13:22] &gt;&gt; If you say father Jesus,
[13:27] &gt;&gt; which is
[13:30] the form of the son?
[13:31] &gt;&gt; WHEN HE COMES IN THE FORM OF THE SON,
[13:35] &gt;&gt; he is the son.
[13:37] &gt;&gt; The dispensation of the sunship.
[13:41] Amen.
[13:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:43] &gt;&gt; BUT
[13:45] &gt;&gt; BUT WHEN YOU SAY father
[13:48] &gt;&gt; you mean
[13:48] &gt;&gt; you can't say
[13:50] &gt;&gt; you can't say father Jesus.
[13:51] &gt;&gt; God was not born.
[13:54] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[13:56] &gt;&gt; God was in Jesus.
[14:01] Amen.
[14:02] &gt;&gt; To reconcile the world unto himself.
[14:05] Now you can't say
[14:09] father Jesus
[14:13] you make him a Roman priest
[14:16] Catholic priest
[14:21] let's look at now
[14:24] let's now
[14:26] few minutes let's take a few minutes now
[14:29] I want to know
[14:34] the prophet,
[14:36] &gt;&gt; what does he say
[14:38] &gt;&gt; about Christ
[14:40] and man?
[14:42] &gt;&gt; Because the whole thing is God and men
[14:48] &gt;&gt; because only let us make men
[14:53] &gt;&gt; in our image.
[14:57] Amen.

[15:54] out what God is or who God is,
[15:58] we can find
[16:00] out what kind of man he has made."
[16:07] That's a nice picture.
[16:09] Amen.

[22:53] Now what what what is bothering us if
[22:55] God is something here?
[22:57] &gt;&gt; Let me read something else for you. Um
[23:01] God has always all times reflected
[23:05] himself in a man.
[23:10] That is of a perfect man. Page 14.
[23:14] Amen. The third paragraph here says God
[23:17] dwells in the stature of a man.
[23:23] right?
[23:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[23:25] &gt;&gt; Reflecting himself into that being
[23:30] and he says that's perfect worship.
[23:38] Perfect worship
[23:41] is when YOU SEE GOD
[23:44] in human flesh
[23:47] that is perfect.
[23:54] When God is made known among HUMANS
[23:59] that is and you recognize him like the
[24:02] Samaritan woman, she came to a to
[24:06] perfection
[24:08] when she identified Jesus
[24:11] as the Messiah who came.
[24:15] That is perfect worship.
[24:19] Amen.
[24:20] &gt;&gt; Otherwise, it's entire Christ.
[24:25] Amen.
[24:29] &gt;&gt; It means people
[24:32] WHO REJECT CHRIST WHEN HE'S IN MAN.
[24:35] AMEN.
[24:37] Antichrist and it's called Antichrist.
[24:42] &gt;&gt; They don't believe that God came in a
[24:45] man.
[24:46] That's
[24:49] &gt;&gt; before we baptize. Let's look at this.
[24:51] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Now, here we are.
[24:58] &gt;&gt; The logos.
[24:59] &gt;&gt; This side it says the logos.
[25:03] &gt;&gt; When you look at the logos,
[25:04] &gt;&gt; that is the entire thing.
[25:07] But here
[25:09] you are the
[25:11] manophony.
[25:13] &gt;&gt; So is God and men.
[25:17] Amen. Amen. Amen.
[25:20] &gt;&gt; Now you came back. YOU CAME TO FLESH
[25:23] &gt;&gt; and bypass your theophony.
[25:26] You came here to be tested.
[25:29] Amen. Amen. But the seventh seal.
[25:34] Amen. Amen. That's why the seventh seal
[25:36] says
[25:38] silent.
[25:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:40] &gt;&gt; Because it is back here.
[25:45] Amen.
[25:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:48] &gt;&gt; The Bible says
[25:50] &gt;&gt; Jesus
[25:51] &gt;&gt; went to the after
[25:54] after
[25:58] &gt;&gt; I thought you listen to God's word.
[26:00] &gt;&gt; Right. Amen.
[26:01] &gt;&gt; Now after the resurrection,
[26:04] he went down
[26:07] to the uttermost.
[26:09] Now you read the book of Hebrews, it
[26:11] tells you that in his theophony,
[26:15] he preached to the lost souls
[26:19] in his theophony.
[26:23] Now after the resurrection from the
[26:25] DENOMINATIONALISM
[26:29] in our theophony,
[26:31] we can go to the underworld.
[26:34] Amen.
[26:36] Amen. Take it or leave it.
[26:42] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[26:45] Hey, we we've got terrible some things
[26:48] to to share.
[26:52] You don't know what's happening.
[26:55] Ask brother,
[26:57] sister,
[26:59] sister.
[27:01] God today
[27:04] can go as far as beyond Peter's BACK
[27:09] to go and pick up something hidden there
[27:13] and bring it to Mia's park.
[27:18] No man can do that.
[27:23] I I don't care what the outside world is
[27:26] saying.
[27:28] I'm talking to you.
[27:31] Amen. Amen.
[27:34] Amen.
[27:35] &gt;&gt; Any other thing is an outsider.
[27:40] &gt;&gt; So I'm not talking to the outsiders.
[27:43] I'm talking to you.
[27:45] Amen.
[27:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[27:49] &gt;&gt; When it comes to marriage and divorce,
[27:52] the prophet said, "This is to my church.
[28:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:04] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:05] &gt;&gt; Because we are identified
[28:09] &gt;&gt; with the people who believe these
[28:11] things,
[28:15] &gt;&gt; not the outsiders.
[28:19] Yeah.
[28:21] Let's finish
[28:22] &gt;&gt; now. Here you are theopha.
[28:24] &gt;&gt; Now that's why the prophet says
[28:27] God and men
[28:29] were one there.
[28:33] That's where God and man was.
[28:37] That's where the prophet says that's
[28:39] where you were in the beginning.
[28:43] In the beginning was
[28:47] the word.
[28:50] That's right. Amen. So the word in you
[28:54] not the words the word in you means God
[28:58] in you.
[29:02] Amen.
[29:03] &gt;&gt; That's why he is now called Mechisedc
[29:09] because Melkisedc is not the wordsc
[29:14] is the word.
[29:16] So if the word is in you that means
[29:21] HAVING NO FATHER, NO MOTHER, no
[29:24] beginning
[29:26] is in you, no one is going to stop us
[29:30] from preaching what we are preaching.
[29:35] Amen.
[29:36] &gt;&gt; No one.
[29:38] &gt;&gt; Okay. Amen.
[29:40] &gt;&gt; You can gossip the way you want.
[29:43] It won't harm us.
[29:46] Right.
[29:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:47] &gt;&gt; There you are.
[29:48] &gt;&gt; Get up.
[29:49] &gt;&gt; Can you pose yourself yet?
[29:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[29:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:04] &gt;&gt; What would you say?
[30:07] &gt;&gt; Can you pose yourself here?
[30:11] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:14] &gt;&gt; If this man
[30:17] If God put this man in the midst of the
[30:21] angels,
[30:24] &gt;&gt; if God
[30:26] uh
[30:29] if if God in Moses
[30:33] opened the the sea,
[30:37] so all Israel
[30:40] appears in the same picture.
[30:44] Amen. Amen.
[30:46] &gt;&gt; Now this man says
[30:52] bear with us just a bit.
[30:57] Let's hear how this man disputes people.
[31:03] Amen. Let me find it. Amen.
[31:09] I'll find it quickly. It's right here.
[31:11] Picture
[31:13] 36.
[31:15] &gt;&gt; Christ is the mystery of God revealed.
[31:19] &gt;&gt; His church
[31:22] &gt;&gt; is himself.
[31:26] Amen. Amen.
[31:28] &gt;&gt; Revealed.
[31:32] Amen.
[31:36] &gt;&gt; When he shall appear,
[31:37] &gt;&gt; we shall be
[31:48] When he appear when does he appear?
[31:49] Amen.
[31:52] &gt;&gt; When he shall appear
[32:01] NOW LIKE HIM. I won't have time to read
[32:05] but it says he let me not read he is the
[32:10] seven seals that were revealed
[32:19] right
[32:20] &gt;&gt; then it says
[32:22] &gt;&gt; he revealed the church
[32:27] &gt;&gt; in the same book let me not read the
[32:31] last thing here is his church
[32:34] is himself
[32:38] revealed because he said at that day you
[32:43] shall know that I am in you.
[32:47] So his church, his bride is himself
[32:52] revealed. When the husband
[32:56] takes over the headship
[32:58] and the head and the body is one unit.
[33:04] Amen.
[33:05] Now the people of the world
[33:08] are still trying to separate the head
[33:11] from the BODY
[33:15] &gt;&gt; because they didn't see the head
[33:19] taking over
[33:22] the body. Now it's one unit.
[33:27] Now you brother,
[33:29] &gt;&gt; you can take photo with them.
[33:34] Amen.
[33:35] Amen.
[33:36] &gt;&gt; Then it will be your photo.
[33:41] &gt;&gt; Nothing to do with me.
[33:45] &gt;&gt; You identify yourself.
[33:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:50] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[33:51] &gt;&gt; All right. Amen.
[33:52] &gt;&gt; Now it is here in the church
[33:56] and the brother has his own in his house
[34:01] together with that one.
[34:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[34:04] &gt;&gt; Now only he has put my head
[34:10] as the head of the church here.
[34:13] But he he can put the entire church
[34:16] there
[34:19] because the high priest
[34:22] the children of Israel
[34:25] according to the thumb
[34:28] they were in the heart of Aaron.
[34:32] Amen. Amen.
[34:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
