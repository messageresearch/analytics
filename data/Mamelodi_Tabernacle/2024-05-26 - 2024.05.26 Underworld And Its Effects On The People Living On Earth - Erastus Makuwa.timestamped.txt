[58:24] to summarize it uh the sister said H she
[58:28] has a child at home by the name of
[58:31] Frida uh the child had blisters and then
[58:35] at the beginning they just thought it
[58:37] was just MOS mosquito bites and but then
[58:40] they there was water coming out of those
[58:43] blisters and then the child was taken to
[58:46] um the clinic and then she was given
[58:48] medication and then the medication did
[58:50] not work and they went for the second
[58:52] time and uh at the the clinic they told
[58:56] her that we do not have any medication
[58:58] that we can give to you uh because this
[59:01] is something that we cannot help you
[59:03] with so she then back she then went back
[59:06] home and then she went to see sister
[59:08] Ivon sister Ivon advised her that this
[59:11] is not uh something usual H it looks
[59:16] like it's something that was done to
[59:18] this child uh like I would say
[59:21] Witchcraft and uh they then decided to
[59:24] call Brother Harvest and then uh brother
[59:27] Harvest H prayed over the child and the
[59:31] child got healed slightly but then after
[59:35] that the child became worse and the
[59:38] incident h of the child cing the
[59:40] blisters it happened after they were
[59:42] visited by her a the sister's Aunt after
[59:46] the sister's Aunt H left then that's
[59:49] when they started to see this p on the
[59:51] child then after the brother har prayer
[59:54] and then the the child got healed
[59:56] but then it came back again and then it
[59:58] was a little bit worse and then the
[1:00:01] sister got a call from her aunt saying
[1:00:03] to her why are you exposing me so the
[1:00:06] sister started fighting H the aunt
[1:00:08] started fighting the sister she the
[1:00:10] sister said it was a spiritual kind of
[1:00:12] war or battle and then h brother harest
[1:00:16] then advised the sister to call brother
[1:00:19] M and brother M she's the sister met
[1:00:23] brother M here at church brother said
[1:00:25] call me when you at home and the sister

[1:00:31] brother M prayed over the child on the
[1:00:33] phone and H the child and the brother
[1:00:37] reassured they that the child is now

[1:04:11] not walk could not talk she could not do
[1:04:13] anything she was just laying down flat
[1:04:15] on the bed and then sister brother K
[1:04:18] came over and prayed over the sister and
[1:04:21] the sister H instead of going for an
[1:04:23] operation she was actually in an ICU
[1:04:26] instead of going to an operation after
[1:04:27] the prayer she could not she did not go
