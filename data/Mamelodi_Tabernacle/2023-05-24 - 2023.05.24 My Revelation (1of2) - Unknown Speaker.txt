any man hear my voice and open the door I will come into him and he will serve with him and he with me to him that overcome will I try to sit with me in my throne even as I also overcame and and sat down with my father in his throne in that as I hear that you hear what the spirit says um I just want to bring a subject a very strong strange subjects amen so I'm going to talk about my Revelation yes amen then while I'm saying my Revelation you also uh after the same way my Revelations [Music] because my Revelation is what God has done for me and to me is what is done to you and for you [Music] he is now at the time of the individuals [Music] now in a group of people John like a church communities and the prophet says we come as individuals [Music] has a place and is a place amen and now we will read how the prophets the message addressing the individuals now I said many times in South Africa you see a group of people singing you'll find that some are not talented they have not seen us but because they sing in a group they all they also shine as good singers amen and uh camera yes we recognize them and put them on a picture they will also appear since but if you can take them one by one message then you realize now you take them individually but if you put them into here they shine together but you call them one by one then you realize so God has done the same thing in the end times [Music] which is individuals it says individual The Prostitute and made the bride of Christ born [Music] it says and unto the angel of the loud on the church on the logician these things because what it is the last Church age amen amen amen means [Music] and he continued and he continued said the amen the faithful and the truth the beginning of the creation of God Amen now we must look at the beginning of the creation of God you always must be a mass cities Christ is being made alone to the church not but no if if he says Christ still decreased uh that means somebody you

Christian is just being made known amen now if we were to ask the sisters and we just take the brothers out and then we ask everything foreign I don't want I don't believe that one sister would pick up somebody else's husband that would mean she doesn't know her husband I believe that each and everyone will say mine is this one million so that's why if I read here okay [Music] now because the the the pride of Christ has is crowned or is kept by Christ foreign [Music] amen now always they put one the first one yeah they make sure they they put somebody faster is the one that will hit the finish line [Music] so he must be very fast and he had to hand it over to another in the second chance but it's always stronger at the end [Music] I don't know the song of [Music] because they type the bride
