[1:14:21] everything H God bless you
[1:14:23] all amen
[1:14:25] amen now we remember that we requested
[1:14:29] our D's Co for that testimony you still
[1:14:36] remember can we just allow him to finish
[1:14:38] up while we are still
[1:14:41] waiting hallelujah hallelujah God bless
[1:14:45] you D just come
[1:14:47] a God bless you amen
[1:14:53] amen uh good good morning
[1:14:58] Saints thank you for the opportunity
[1:15:02] once
[1:15:04] again while we are still waiting for the
[1:15:09] pastor just stand in this Gap
[1:15:14] here okay the pastor always says
[1:15:19] that the testimonies they edify
[1:15:25] amen
[1:15:28] amen they edify in this
[1:15:32] sense that maybe somebody might be
[1:15:37] taking the issue of
[1:15:40] uh repentance and worshiping God for
[1:15:48] granted like I I've
[1:15:51] said that when I was not a worshipper
[1:15:56] I was definitely sure that I'm
[1:15:59] [Music]
[1:16:01] right that now whoever want to worship
[1:16:06] God it's up to
[1:16:08] him and whoever doesn't want to worship
[1:16:11] God it's also up to
[1:16:14] him so it's not the
[1:16:19] same it isn't like that God created
[1:16:23] heaven and earth
[1:16:26] and
[1:16:27] everybody obliged must worship
[1:16:32] God and and if you don't worship
[1:16:36] God you definitely going to
[1:16:41] hell
[1:16:43] and in
[1:16:45] head there's no turning
[1:16:48] back your uncle won't be
[1:16:51] there your father won't be there your
[1:16:55] loved ones won't be
[1:16:58] there it will be
[1:17:01] you and the Bible
[1:17:04] says you will be there forever and
[1:17:10] ever now forever and
[1:17:12] ever it could be billions and billions
[1:17:15] of
[1:17:17] years okay fine last time uh
[1:17:21] [Music]
[1:17:22] I I stopped when the pastor
[1:17:28] arrived and even today
[1:17:31] please make me aware I don't want to
[1:17:36] take
[1:17:37] okay I said last
[1:17:41] time God sent a
[1:17:44] man I was still a young
[1:17:49] man to come and testify to
[1:17:53] me it was a strange
[1:17:56] man because during that
[1:17:59] time there were these fightings against
[1:18:02] blacks and white here in South
[1:18:07] Africa you couldn't get a white
[1:18:11] man that will drive all the way right
[1:18:14] into the center of
[1:18:18] mamod all by
[1:18:21] himself so now when I was in the
[1:18:25] bottomless
[1:18:28] pit uh begging and crying and doing
[1:18:33] all then I was told that I was given a
[1:18:38] chance and the chance that I was
[1:18:43] given was that now a I'm
[1:18:52] sorry oh yeah maybe it's Aquas want to
[1:18:56] what you call got a message I'm just
[1:18:58] saying to
[1:19:00] so I was
[1:19:04] given uh no this man I mean I said no
[1:19:08] because uh I didn't know these
[1:19:11] things and I was ignorant on that and I
[1:19:15] was not given a
[1:19:18] chance this seems to be
[1:19:21] unfair I was not aware that there's God
[1:19:26] I was not even aware that there's a
[1:19:28] devil actually I was not aware what type
[1:19:32] of life should I
[1:19:34] live because when you grow
[1:19:37] out when you grow
[1:19:39] out you just take anything the people
[1:19:42] are
[1:19:43] doing you follow
[1:19:46] friends you follow
[1:19:48] families you follow neighbors you follow
[1:19:52] whoever right then it was said okay F
[1:19:55] but you send
[1:19:58] somebody and many
[1:20:01] times and you
[1:20:04] rejected so the only place for
[1:20:07] you is this one and when it says is this
[1:20:12] one and then when that voice
[1:20:15] speak everything stands
[1:20:18] still even the torment stand
[1:20:22] still you could wish you could keep on
[1:20:27] talking but when he says now this is the
[1:20:30] only place for
[1:20:31] you then you had to go back to
[1:20:35] that so then you fall
[1:20:38] again you get into that
[1:20:41] torment of which you cannot describe
[1:20:45] it now some of the things the Bible
[1:20:48] says they are definitely
[1:20:52] true when the pastor always stands
[1:20:55] here and says
[1:20:58] may to those that will miss the
[1:21:02] Rapture it's not a
[1:21:06] joke when it says the fire is
[1:21:09] coming it's not an ordinary fire that
[1:21:12] you
[1:21:13] [Music]
[1:21:14] seen uh when your soul is
[1:21:20] tormented it's not like when your body
[1:21:23] is tormented
[1:21:26] it's two different
[1:21:29] torments remember when your soul is in
[1:21:32] [Music]
[1:21:33] torment like that rich
[1:21:36] man who was in
[1:21:39] torment who said to
[1:21:41] Abraham send
[1:21:44] Lazarus just to get a
[1:21:48] tip water just to quench my tongue
[1:21:54] the true
[1:21:56] thing okay fine it went
[1:22:00] on and then I kept on
[1:22:03] begging and then communicating with that
[1:22:08] voice until uh I
[1:22:14] I
[1:22:17] until I I just woke
[1:22:20] up I find uh there was a white sheet
[1:22:24] covered C in
[1:22:27] me the one that they use after you
[1:22:29] you're dead they cover you with a
[1:22:32] certain material called k or
[1:22:38] something so I was once covered with
[1:22:42] that so it was ready to be taken to Mo
[1:22:45] in the
[1:22:47] fridge I I wouldn't be standing here
[1:22:52] today so now I was a young man I was not
[1:22:57] married
[1:22:59] then never read the Bible in my
[1:23:04] life and then so was offered the Bible I
[1:23:07] mean I told the my
[1:23:11] coworker who was a message believer
[1:23:16] Solana like I said he gave me the St of
[1:23:20] a perfect
[1:23:22] man I went through each
[1:23:25] then he gave
[1:23:28] me the other one what's that one remind
[1:23:32] me
[1:23:35] demonology then I went through
[1:23:38] it then I saw that yes there's some
[1:23:41] parts which I was in that I see in this
[1:23:49] demonology then there
[1:23:52] thereafter he invited me to the
[1:23:57] service service the service was
[1:23:59] somewhere in a
[1:24:02] classroom I think in
[1:24:05] lady I went
[1:24:09] there uh there were very
[1:24:13] few then the pastors was
[1:24:19] preaching so now it was the first time
[1:24:22] in my life
[1:24:24] that I could hear a man speaking like
[1:24:28] that we we grew up being
[1:24:34] argument and
[1:24:37] myself I didn't want to speak P or or
[1:24:41] whatever
[1:24:43] it speaking Zulu
[1:24:46] only I thought that the only people in
[1:24:48] South Africa
[1:24:51] zul because my mother was a Zulu
[1:24:55] so when I arrived here in
[1:24:57] prioria I find people speaking a funny
[1:25:02] language then I was in M high
[1:25:05] school and then they ill treated
[1:25:09] me so I started
[1:25:12] hating uh
[1:25:16] PES now on that day when the pastor was
[1:25:21] preaching was preaching in b
[1:25:25] but there was such
[1:25:28] love that I saw
[1:25:31] there that pulled
[1:25:34] me I couldn't understand what he was
[1:25:37] saying but they could grasp what he was
[1:25:40] saying that's how now I was taken to be
[1:25:45] baptized here
[1:25:49] River so I was baptized
[1:25:52] there in the name of our Lord Jesus
[1:25:56] Christ amen
[1:25:59] amen but then I was the only one that
[1:26:03] was dressed in a funny
[1:26:08] way when I look at the other
[1:26:11] people they are not dressed like
[1:26:16] myself M knows about
[1:26:20] it how did I look that thing
[1:26:33] I think M was the only young lady in
[1:26:35] that
[1:26:39] church but what I want to say is that
[1:26:43] now the pastor pulled me towards
[1:26:48] himself and then I would ask
[1:26:52] questions then he will answer me me so
[1:26:55] he took me wherever he
[1:26:59] goes went
[1:27:04] around until I knew that nationality
[1:27:07] means
[1:27:12] nothing so I Started Loving
[1:27:16] everybody but I said the day I came to
[1:27:20] the
[1:27:22] service all my attack was a stolen
[1:27:27] one there was not even a single one that
[1:27:29] I
[1:27:32] bought so we live that
[1:27:36] life uh and I had a
[1:27:40] car that car was bought only to go to sh
[1:27:44] beans and go and drink so that at night
[1:27:47] they must not molest me on my way back
[1:27:56] then it was converted
[1:27:58] to uh the work of
[1:28:03] God amen amen so uh I was not married by
[1:28:10] then then the ad the pastor advised me
[1:28:13] to get
[1:28:15] married and there were no sisters in our
[1:28:20] assembly it was sister alone
[1:28:24] very
[1:28:34] few and
[1:28:39] because my relatives
[1:28:43] refused that I should marry in a a
[1:28:46] Christian
[1:28:49] way they said I must first go to the
[1:28:52] Mountain School
[1:28:56] I refused then they said we are not
[1:28:59] going to get you that woman you
[1:29:04] want and the Pastor said
[1:29:07] come so he's the one that took me
[1:29:12] to to get me this
[1:29:15] wife that's
[1:29:19] why that's why the two of
[1:29:23] us will never depart from the
[1:29:28] pastor they they can go if they want
[1:29:33] [Applause]
[1:29:38] to we know where we come
[1:29:47] from can
[1:29:51] go I will stick to
[1:29:54] [Music]
[1:29:56] amen
[1:29:58] because not that I love a
[1:30:02] man but I've seen the
[1:30:06] word
[1:30:08] amen during my youth
[1:30:12] time there was this argument about the
[1:30:18] Thunders some says Thunders are the
[1:30:21] virtues
[1:30:24] so we were uh
[1:30:29] nicknamed that we uh don't we don't
[1:30:32] believe in
[1:30:34] Thunders like right now we are
[1:30:38] nicknamed that we are
[1:30:42] preaching
[1:30:43] uh Under
[1:30:47] World now the pastor would explain
[1:30:51] everything about the Thunders
[1:30:55] that they
[1:30:57] carrier they
[1:30:59] carry the
[1:31:01] voice what is
[1:31:04] important it's not the Thunder
[1:31:07] themselves The
[1:31:09] Voice what was
[1:31:14] uttered now that I'm making this
[1:31:18] testimony so that the young ones should
[1:31:21] be encouraged
[1:31:25] that I was not married by
[1:31:28] then when I was
[1:31:30] young my uncle took me
[1:31:33] to in
[1:31:37] D5 and then that that said to
[1:31:41] me you will never get
[1:31:44] married you're going to suffer the rest
[1:31:46] of your
[1:31:47] life you will never have a
[1:31:51] child then in respect but I said not
[1:31:57] me then my uncle chased me out of
[1:32:01] that now I'm looking for
[1:32:04] that I'm married I've got a wife I've
[1:32:07] got five
[1:32:09] children amen I'm happy in the
[1:32:14] word yeah so
[1:32:16] Believers it is true there
[1:32:20] is a bottomless pit
[1:32:25] but now when you
[1:32:27] die I don't know there there there are
[1:32:30] lot of
[1:32:34] levels in
[1:32:36] Hell there's where the devil
[1:32:40] is that's where his angels
[1:32:43] are that's where the demons
[1:32:46] are that's where the lost souls
[1:32:50] are there's lot of punishment there
[1:32:55] if there was one who was once a
[1:32:58] Wich will bear me out that there's lot
[1:33:02] of
[1:33:04] yeah and even the pain that is
[1:33:07] there it's not a physical
[1:33:10] pain no it's a
[1:33:14] pain that you cannot
[1:33:18] describe we don't worship God because we
[1:33:21] are afraid of that pain
[1:33:24] we worship God because that is our
[1:33:30] nature now if there is one that says
[1:33:34] there is no
[1:33:36] God you must ask
[1:33:39] me I grew out here
[1:33:42] in I
[1:33:47] was we together I was well known here in
[1:33:51] m
[1:33:54] but God touched
[1:33:58] me and then there was no turning
[1:34:02] back friends
[1:34:05] came you see when when when when you are
[1:34:09] when God calls
[1:34:11] you there be lot of
[1:34:14] Temptation some will come with
[1:34:18] whiskies with
[1:34:20] cigarettes with beautiful girls
[1:34:24] trying to entice
[1:34:26] me but I just
[1:34:31] said it's over I've seen the Lord and

[2:20:04] restore the
[2:20:06] Masterpiece brought
[2:20:09] up that's the
[2:20:11] reason she was
[2:20:14] in
[2:20:18] reviewed the second
[2:20:23] amen praise God you know
[2:20:27] something
[2:20:29] uh which God was not pleased
[2:20:34] with he will never return praise
[2:20:44] God she was
[2:20:48] reviewed the first time
[2:20:51] then she was
[2:20:54] reviewed the second
[2:20:56] time God loves her so
[2:21:00] much and trust her so
[2:21:03] much that she brings her for the second
[2:21:09] time because he still the same one that
[2:21:13] God
[2:21:15] [Applause]
[2:21:21] you know
[2:21:22] sometimes in our
[2:21:27] homes when maybe there's some
[2:21:32] visitors there there are some there some
[2:21:35] of the
[2:21:37] children you want want to display before
[2:21:47] the because of their behavior
[2:21:51] you
[2:21:58] know all those one you just see one
[2:22:01] suddenly com in grabbing the entire
[2:22:03] bread and going
[2:22:05] out now it's hard for the parents to
[2:22:13] introduce okay now yeah but the bride
[2:22:17] because uh she has pleased God so much
[2:22:24] that's why God will always display
[2:22:33] her like a a good
[2:22:39] husband with a good
[2:22:43] wife amen will
[2:22:46] always review and
[2:22:51] show her to the
[2:22:53] big she's a well-mannered
[2:22:58] wife she won't
[2:23:02] disappoint amen yeah God bless
[2:23:05] you we are go we are looking under the
[2:23:11] seals
[2:23:14] revealed now we are just looking for few
[2:23:18] minutes
[2:23:21] even
[2:23:22] the the seven
[2:23:25] SE uh the bride is not confused with the
[2:23:29] seventh
[2:23:34] se you know why
[2:23:37] God even the book that we have read the
[2:23:40] other day it
[2:23:44] says God
[2:23:47] worked it was in his mind
[2:23:51] if you
[2:23:55] notice it come by like by
[2:24:01] Evolution like he was learning all the
[2:24:06] time make something greater
[2:24:09] greater but he was above all of
[2:24:16] it amen now but let me
[2:24:21] pass to this part that we have read last
[2:24:25] time now in
[2:24:29] creation actually he was coming to
[2:24:36] something let's say maybe God started by
[2:24:40] creating a
[2:24:45] tiger and next time it
[2:24:49] is it being chased by the people and
[2:24:53] all he was coming to something all the
[2:25:00] time that's say we had some kind of
[2:25:05] denominations but that was not the
[2:25:10] bride because when the Bride Comes she
[2:25:13] will be like him
[2:25:16] amen amen amen you don't have to ask
[2:25:20] question about the bread of
[2:25:23] Christ no then it
[2:25:28] says he began to bring upon the
[2:25:33] Earth
[2:25:35] life
[2:25:37] fish
[2:25:39] fall
[2:25:40] but the greater part of his
[2:25:44] mind he was coming to
[2:25:48] something an image
[2:25:54] he started with some
[2:25:56] things maybe would see a
[2:25:59] bed and you say oh is it like God no he
[2:26:04] was
[2:26:05] coming to his
[2:26:10] image all these denominational
[2:26:16] years
[2:26:18] coming to his
[2:26:22] [Applause]
[2:26:24] image until the Bible
[2:26:26] says we shall see
[2:26:29] him as he
[2:26:33] is God knowing that we cannot say Amen
[2:26:37] to all the pictures that are
[2:26:41] coming we cannot say it's
[2:26:44] him but that day he say he shall as he
[2:26:49] passes by
[2:26:52] display we shall see him as
[2:26:57] he amen all these other figures shall
[2:27:01] pass this way
[2:27:03] that and we shall say no it's not
[2:27:06] him because we the bride shall see him
[2:27:12] as
[2:27:16] he it never said we shall see a church
[2:27:20] we shall see
[2:27:23] him
[2:27:25] but as keep this
[2:27:28] word as
[2:27:32] he the person who shall see him as he
[2:27:36] is somebody who has seen
[2:27:40] [Music]
[2:27:42] him amen now if you bring some pictures
[2:27:47] to
[2:27:51] they he shall say no this is not the one
[2:27:53] this is not the one this is not the one
[2:27:56] because he will see
[2:28:01] him
[2:28:02] amen all right
[2:28:06] amen we we have read
[2:28:08] this after he has done all
[2:28:12] this
[2:28:17] display fishes
[2:28:21] the bride keeping on saying not this
[2:28:28] way and then something in his own
[2:28:34] image
[2:28:37] amen that's where God
[2:28:42] stopped God will only
[2:28:45] stop when he sees himself in you
[2:28:52] then he will stop before
[2:28:54] you because he is like looking at a
[2:29:00] mirror God sees
[2:29:04] himself
[2:29:05] amen what does God see when he meets
[2:29:13] you amen
[2:29:17] amen because he made the
[2:29:20] like a
[2:29:25] mirror that's why it
[2:29:28] says then this is power of
[2:29:33] transformation page
[2:29:36] 10 we read it several times last then
[2:29:41] something in his own
[2:29:46] image just like you
[2:29:50] you'll go
[2:29:52] around uh joining this
[2:29:56] church joining that
[2:29:59] church but what keeps you working
[2:30:02] on it is because you haven't
[2:30:07] yet met the
[2:30:09] one you
[2:30:11] [Music]
[2:30:14] know amen amen everywhere you go they
[2:30:17] are singing
[2:30:20] I love Jesus
[2:30:23] but you enter in and
[2:30:26] no because you are not you don't attend
[2:30:31] church for
[2:30:36] music you want to
[2:30:45] see are we together
[2:30:50] start off this
[2:30:54] morning
[2:30:56] uh what did you
[2:31:00] think you were picking to go
[2:31:06] where preparing
[2:31:10] yourself let's go to church to do
[2:31:17] what amen
[2:31:22] so a true
[2:31:26] Christian even when he wakes up in the
[2:31:30] morning he is just
[2:31:33] thinking of
[2:31:40] seeing that's a
[2:31:43] true amen all right amen before I close
[2:31:51] okay then like the other day we read
[2:31:57] this when he was doing
[2:32:00] his
[2:32:02] rounds then it says that something in
[2:32:08] his
[2:32:10] own
[2:32:15] image what you what would you do
[2:32:20] or what will you
[2:32:23] do maybe you start in the
[2:32:28] morning you are trying to look for your
[2:32:30] own
[2:32:33] image amen amen you will come back tired
[2:32:37] in the
[2:32:40] evening having having not met meet your
[2:32:46] image
[2:32:52] then God made sure
[2:32:56] that he will come with
[2:32:59] sevenes
[2:33:02] seven coming to his
[2:33:07] image it took God a
[2:33:11] lot the whole thing was
[2:33:14] just uh in his
[2:33:17] mind was to come to his image
[2:33:23] that's why when he opened the
[2:33:26] Serv
[2:33:29] [Applause]
[2:33:31] sto because he knew that my
[2:33:35] image should be at the
[2:33:39] seven because back there he said let us
[2:33:44] make in
[2:33:47] our amen

[2:33:58] day oh the church is quiet right anyhow

[2:34:09] coming and then something in his
[2:34:15] own
[2:34:17] image amen
[2:34:20] God knew
[2:34:22] that there would never
[2:34:25] be somebody in His
[2:34:30] image
[2:34:33] because he knew that Something In His
[2:34:41] Image will would be
[2:34:45] something that he
[2:34:47] himself because no
[2:34:50] one could create His
[2:34:53] Image the only image appeared on
[2:35:01] the amen amen amen he was not going
[2:35:04] around asking are you my

[2:36:01] [Applause]
[2:36:04] himself
[2:36:06] something okay amen then he stopped I
[2:36:13] am tell us about Revelation
[2:36:17] 8 what it says

[2:36:24] there was silence in heaven about the
[2:36:26] space of half an hour

[2:36:41] SE did he see somebody
[2:36:45] there

[2:36:57] was up to
[2:36:59] his
[2:37:04] Perfection What God calls
[2:37:07] perfect is when he meets his own
[2:37:12] [Music]
[2:37:14] image God can never say to you you are
[2:37:17] perfect
[2:37:20] he sees
