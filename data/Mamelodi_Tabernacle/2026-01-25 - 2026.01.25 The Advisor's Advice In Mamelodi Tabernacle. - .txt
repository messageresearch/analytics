[clears throat] &gt;&gt; Isaiah 9:5 For every battle of the warrior is with confused noise and garments roll in blood, but this shall be with burning and fuel of fire. This is what the Bible says, &gt;&gt; just repeating it but in a French version. Nepal admira de la uh it does not match it the pass straight away. A child is given to us. Um where it says the child is given to us. Okay. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Six. For to us a child is born. Yes. Okay. &gt;&gt; For unto us a child is born. Unto us a son is given, and the government shall be upon his shoulder, and his name shall be called wonderful, counselor, the mighty God, the everlasting father, the prince of peace. &gt;&gt; Okay. Let's go to Proverbs &gt;&gt; chapter 15 &gt;&gt; and verse 22. &gt;&gt; This is what it says. The pastor will read in the French, Dan will read in the English. Without the council, purposes are disappointed. But in the multitude of multitude of counselors, they are established. We shall pray. &gt;&gt; God Almighty, &gt;&gt; we humbly come before you this morning. Every time that we stand before you on a Sunday in order to worship you, &gt;&gt; we always remember what you did for our redemption. &gt;&gt; Because you are the only one founder of a religion. Which religion left an empty tomb in Jerusalem? &gt;&gt; Muhammad his tomb is not empty. &gt;&gt; And all others, Buddha, Confucious and all others, they are in the tomb. &gt;&gt; But she came out of the tomb on the third day. And on a Sunday we come in order to commemorate of your resurrection. &gt;&gt; We bless your holy name. &gt;&gt; We bless your resurrection. We bless your presence. &gt;&gt; We bless you for the message of the hour. We bless you for the spoken word. We bless you for the seventh seal. &gt;&gt; We bless you for the works that pastor has done here and we do believe that his soul is resting in peace. Be with us, father, &gt;&gt; from the beginning all the way to the end. As I am going to make some noise, may you be with me. &gt;&gt; Be with my brother translating. May you give a good understanding to your children. May you get their hearts ready, Lord, &gt;&gt; in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Please have a seat. Once more, let me greet you in the precious name of the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Are you feeling good this morning? &gt;&gt; Please give God a praise if you feel good. [applause] &gt;&gt; Amen. When the honorable Deacon Mete requested that I should bring the word this morning on this Sunday, I went all over trying to see what am I going to say. I do believe that you are not offended when I call deacons as honorable. [applause] Brother Brham is the one that calls or refers the deacon as honorable. &gt;&gt; Honorables are not those in a parliament but the true honorables are these ones that you have here. Hello. &gt;&gt; And I kept trying to see what am I going to say. I could not see the picture unfolding. I kept praying. But God by his grace gave me a little inspiration which I would like to share with you this morning. But considering that I have like a two hours, I'm going to try my best in order to finish as soon as possible because generally speaking. I am uh one of the kind of preachers who preach longer than you you could ever think. &gt;&gt; Sometimes when I shorten my preaching is a four hours. &gt;&gt; [laughter] &gt;&gt; So feel comfortable. &gt;&gt; Feel comfortable. And I believe that my patriarch pastor was not a preacher who would shorten his preaching and preach for 30 minutes. Pastor Kim would take his time. So I remember when he came to Mati when he climbed the pulpit &gt;&gt; he spoke slowly but surely &gt;&gt; to us as he spoke so slowly we thought he was going to end the preaching in the next 2 minute 10 minutes or 20 minutes 1 Second hour, three hours and my church all together. They said this is one of our family member. [applause] But I promise I am not going to be long. &gt;&gt; But please, I need your favor. And the favor that I want from you is your attention. &gt;&gt; So this morning I would like to speak. &gt;&gt; I would like to speak on the subject of the advisor's advice in the tabernacle. because I thought that I should just give you an advice because I might to preach I might touch here and there but considering the time that you are going through &gt;&gt; you need one thing and that is an advice. Do you need a counsel? &gt;&gt; You shall see here in the Bible. &gt;&gt; Where we from reading? Isaiah chapter 9. &gt;&gt; And you know that Isaiah was or is a great prophet &gt;&gt; on his own. He preached the entire Bible. says that Isaiah himself preached about the creation. Isaiah spoke of the creation and he also spoke about the fall of the man. He spoke of the redeemer and he also spoke of the rapture. It touched the millennium and he also spoke of hell. So notice the Bible that we have here. &gt;&gt; This Bible has got a 66 books. Any other book that has got no 66 books, &gt;&gt; these are the added Bibles. They are fake Bibles. &gt;&gt; So these are fake Bibles. &gt;&gt; But they shoot the genuine Bible. &gt;&gt; The original Bible &gt;&gt; has got a six 66 books. If you got the Bible like Toby, they have spoken of the wisdom or justice and makabi. These are added books. &gt;&gt; But the true Bible has got 66 books. And Isaiah has written 60 books shortened in this Bible. Now notice one thing. While he was announcing the coming of the redeemer, So our redeemer before he could even come the prophet Isaiah the prophet spoke of his coming. &gt;&gt; And as he spoke of his coming, he told us, he showed us what would be his attributes, what would be the works of the redeemer. &gt;&gt; So this is what he say. Notice the prophetical characteristics of this redeemer. &gt;&gt; Notice here. &gt;&gt; This is what he says a child is born unto us. &gt;&gt; Notice he never say that the child shall come. This is a present tense. A child is born unto us. praise and dance. And I believe on that day, people had gone to the hospital to see because he say that a child was born. One le what he said in the present time, it was something that was to take a place 700 years later. That's the reason why as soon as you receive a prophet, &gt;&gt; be careful. Pay attention to the prophetical language &gt;&gt; because the prophet is someone is someone who lives in two different worlds at the same time. &gt;&gt; He could be at the same time in eternity. He sees the things in eternity. At the same time, he's living in time. That's why when he a prophet speaks, he could be speaking of things he so in detected. He speaks as if though they were in the prison. So you must be ignorant &gt;&gt; in order to go high and see and understand what he is trying to say. &gt;&gt; Jesus would say, &gt;&gt; no one has ever seen the father except the son which came down from the father. The son which came from heaven and which is now in heaven. Yet he said he was in heaven. &gt;&gt; He was before them saying he was in heaven standing before them yet saying that he was in heaven. But in what kind of heaven was that? &gt;&gt; It was not the skies. It meant that he was in a different dimension. That is why &gt;&gt; a prophet for you to understand well the prophet you must be or it takes a prophetical people. So here he says a child is born unto us. A son is given unto present tense. He is born. Is given &gt;&gt; but dominion &gt;&gt; shall see dominion shall &gt;&gt; in the same chapter. He speaks of the present and he also touches the future at the same time. &gt;&gt; Dominion shall rest upon his shoulder. &gt;&gt; He shall be called &gt;&gt; admirable. &gt;&gt; Now this is what he says. He shall be called &gt;&gt; um he shall be called the admirable &gt;&gt; counselor mighty God, &gt;&gt; everlasting father, &gt;&gt; prince of peace, But we this morning are going to speak about the counselor, the advisor. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A counselor, the adviser, &gt;&gt; that's the reason why you shall not see. If you are in a message, if you look in a message more than events made clear by prophecy says something there that Jesus was the counselor today in the message events I'm not going to be reading a lot so as to say much. So who is a counselor? See, when you see in all these big governments of the world, the first thing you see is the president of the country. But all around him is good advises, counselors, a counselor is a very important man even in the Old Testament. We see kings in the Bible. Those kings had counselors. &gt;&gt; If you see consider that David's life, &gt;&gt; you shall see that David of old, he had a mighty counselor. The the the the Bible speaks of Ashel. &gt;&gt; He was a mighty counselor. and who was close to David counselors they earn higher salaries. These are the people that you do not see with your eyes. &gt;&gt; They are not even occupying some seats in the ministry. &gt;&gt; They are not ministers. &gt;&gt; They are not the prime ministers. &gt;&gt; But everything a president is trying to do in any kind of domain he has to go through counselors first. That is why &gt;&gt; the president have got counselors uh in a health domain, &gt;&gt; a military counselor in all the domains that you may list to say that before a president could do anything, &gt;&gt; he calls the counselor for that particular domain. &gt;&gt; He says now electricity. &gt;&gt; We would like for example to invest money in electricity or in health. But you know how it works this domain how it works. What shall we do? You you see you only see a president standing before the people and say this is what we're going to do. This is this is what we're going to do. Well, he did not he is not skilled in electricity. &gt;&gt; He did not he is not a doctor. &gt;&gt; But what he tells you about medicine all these come from the counselor. That's right. This ministry of counseling is so important that to the extent that the Bible tells us that if the plans, should you have a plan and that plan of yours fails, it's a lack of advisers or counselors. It means a group of people sitting down tableling the mater and trying to see what advice to give. &gt;&gt; And this is what he says. &gt;&gt; He says, "But a plan may succeed may succeed only when there's many counselors." This one adds another one speaks. Another one speaks. But brother when he came, he says it that this is the domain of war for battle. We need many counselors. So that for each weapon there is a counselor. But when it comes to salvation, &gt;&gt; redemption, we only have one counselor which is the Lord Jesus Christ. He is our counselor. Now notice often times we fail &gt;&gt; because we fail because we do not we do not want to exploit the attributes of counselor. We fail. We fix him to marry. We've got a counselor which is the Lord Jesus. But how does a Jesus counselor how are you or where are you going to meet Jesus in your room expecting him to walk out &gt;&gt; to give you advice? But listen, Jesus advises us &gt;&gt; through his servants, [cheering] &gt;&gt; through our pastors, &gt;&gt; they are the ones in which God or to which God gives uh counel counsel. &gt;&gt; Jesus speaks through them. &gt;&gt; Notice Notice advisor they are very expensive. They get more money to have a counselor. These are very important people. They are very expensive. But notice a president might have many counselors. This cost him more money. But in the church, God gives you the best counselor. And when you come for counseling, &gt;&gt; he doesn't require money from you. He gives you advices free of charge. But often times, &gt;&gt; we fail to even go to our pastors and ask for advisor. We are we want to get married. &gt;&gt; We open our eyes. looking &gt;&gt; the one that is for brown color &gt;&gt; and the one dark color, &gt;&gt; the the the slender one. &gt;&gt; While God in order for God to give a woman to Adam, God caused Adam to fall into a deep sleeper first. &gt;&gt; Adam's eyes were not open. Adam could hardly see. &gt;&gt; He left the God. &gt;&gt; Adam suffered God to do the work. &gt;&gt; But when God woke Adam up, &gt;&gt; Adam looks and he says, see right now, behold now that which is the flesh of my was not with a naked eyes because he was asleep. But we leave pastors aside, &gt;&gt; ministers aside, &gt;&gt; the Lord aside, &gt;&gt; we ask nothing as advice. &gt;&gt; And here we are. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Like right now is in a period of transition. In this transition, you need an advisor and the counselor that I give you. Meanwhile, the the counselor that I'm going to give you right now, meantime, don't have your eyes open. Have your eyes closed every day. &gt;&gt; On your knees, &gt;&gt; praying, Lord, &gt;&gt; Lord, Lord, Lord, Lord. Because the minute you have your eyes wide open, &gt;&gt; you will put your your your your cannon feelings. &gt;&gt; You will desire. This one is out of my tribe. So this one only. &gt;&gt; That is why we need our eyes to be closed. to pray unto God &gt;&gt; to ask Lord, &gt;&gt; Lord, what is your will? &gt;&gt; Amen. [cheering] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The counselor. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So, what is my counsel to you this morning? I'm going to speak on four major points that you need to take with you as a councils. transition &gt;&gt; for your transitions &gt;&gt; in order to have a safe landing &gt;&gt; in our daily life. The most difficult stage in one's life &gt;&gt; is that period of transition. &gt;&gt; Notice says this. When you give a birth to a child, &gt;&gt; this a child has to go through three stages. &gt;&gt; The first age is at the age of a childhood. He is a child depending on the parents living under the parents rules. She's being carried, being cared for. says this age, &gt;&gt; it's the age of innocency where the child knows nothing. &gt;&gt; This is the the the age of a childhood. We show them how to we train them how to brush, how to put on a shirt or t-shirt, how to eat. This is the age of the childhood. Now going beyond that age, there is another age which is of adult. As an adult, he doesn't need anyone to show him how to brush. He doesn't need someone to teach him how to eat himself. Decides. But notice &gt;&gt; between the age of the childhood and the adult age. &gt;&gt; In between there's an age of transition which is the age of a teenagers. And the brother says that the teenage, &gt;&gt; a child, &gt;&gt; a boy &gt;&gt; or a girl, &gt;&gt; they step into the age of foolishness or phony. They are lost. They don't even know what they have to do. They follow this one. Follow that one. Follow the other one. When he sees this, they follow. &gt;&gt; When he sees the other thing, he goes out. They copy. They're copying from each other. That's why &gt;&gt; please don't have your your eyes elsewhere. &gt;&gt; Focus on the master. [cheering] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now listen. &gt;&gt; So during this time, &gt;&gt; we need four major points. First, &gt;&gt; the importance of a family &gt;&gt; as a family. I want us understand this this morning &gt;&gt; that as we are seated here, &gt;&gt; we are a family. This is the first point. If every single one of you could understand that we are a family, &gt;&gt; each family &gt;&gt; has the ups &gt;&gt; and downs, &gt;&gt; has a problems, &gt;&gt; has a difficulties, &gt;&gt; but despite the ups &gt;&gt; and downs, &gt;&gt; we still stick together as a family. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You still a family. &gt;&gt; This is my first appointment. &gt;&gt; The second one. &gt;&gt; The second character &gt;&gt; which gives power or strength to the family. Any given family &gt;&gt; that which gives a strength to the family is unity. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Notice &gt;&gt; God has given us two instruments in the body &gt;&gt; which helps us which help us to do anything we we want. If I'm having a mind of working whether in an office, &gt;&gt; God has given us two hands. &gt;&gt; These are two hands. &gt;&gt; They are being equipped with a 10 toes &gt;&gt; 10 or fingers &gt;&gt; and these 10 fingers. None of these fingers can perform the work on its own. &gt;&gt; No, it cannot do that. &gt;&gt; For the work to be well done, &gt;&gt; we need all these fingers. Notice he that go decide to go into the field when he he takes the who &gt;&gt; or the sword you don't take it with that one finger &gt;&gt; but you take the sword with it all the five fingers. So when you take it this way, all the fingers as one family in unity when you grow then you work. See when you come when you go into the field you see that the work is moving forward if you need to cut down a tree &gt;&gt; and that you are not as powerful as you should be to cut down the tree what do you what do you do the you take the axe now you need the help of this other hand &gt;&gt; this one comes That's when it comes then you hold it with a tool cutting down the tree cutting down the tree. &gt;&gt; That is why men in the world what do they say union unity &gt;&gt; is a strength. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now the third point that we're going to exploit &gt;&gt; is love. &gt;&gt; A family. &gt;&gt; First point the family. &gt;&gt; Secondly the unity in the family on the third point love in the same family. I am not talking about that love whereby you give me a drink because I'm thirsty &gt;&gt; or you give me food. &gt;&gt; No, that is not the kind of love I'm talking about. &gt;&gt; Because the Apostle Paul says even when I will be able to give up to give out my food, &gt;&gt; give my food to the poor. But if I fail to have love, it is nothing. So how is it that someone gives all he has as a food and that kind of person failing to have love? You know what love &gt;&gt; is something else? The kind of love I'm talking about &gt;&gt; is the seventh seal. &gt;&gt; The capstone. &gt;&gt; This capstone that you see over there says the capstone that is a divine love. When the capstone comes down The capstone unites the entire body around it. &gt;&gt; The capstone &gt;&gt; it comes down &gt;&gt; with unity with oneness. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the last point of the four, &gt;&gt; it is that which you call Leonip. &gt;&gt; Yes, it's in a Hebrew word. It's a Hebrew word. &gt;&gt; And what is it? &gt;&gt; Yumipur. It is a feast &gt;&gt; which is happening in Israel ever since &gt;&gt; it happens in the month of October &gt;&gt; and that feast &gt;&gt; it's a a great feast &gt;&gt; in the French &gt;&gt; or in both the French and English is being translated as as the feast of the great pardon, &gt;&gt; a great pardon, &gt;&gt; that feast, &gt;&gt; the children of Israel would come together &gt;&gt; and that day they would forgive each other. Now you shall see that brother in his ministry on October &gt;&gt; in October &gt;&gt; 28th of October 1963 almost the same period as the Hebrews preach the message &gt;&gt; pardon Is there anyone here that has had that opportunity of reading this message entitled pardon? Has anyone here ever read that message? Pardon? &gt;&gt; Pardon? You shall notice &gt;&gt; that each family, &gt;&gt; each family is not immune to problems. &gt;&gt; There's always a problems in every family. &gt;&gt; Every each family has got problems. Sometimes it's a father against a mother or a mother with a children. But why is it that they still stick together as a united family? &gt;&gt; It's only because in the family there's something in the family &gt;&gt; that washes all the indifferences &gt;&gt; and that thing it's called the pardon. That's why back home in the Congo, we've got our natural uh proverb that says That says that dirty clothes, &gt;&gt; dirty clothes &gt;&gt; are not are not washed on the streets, &gt;&gt; but dirty clothes &gt;&gt; are washed in a as a family together. &gt;&gt; You see someone with a nice top, nice blouse, &gt;&gt; so clean, tidy, But way did she wash it? &gt;&gt; In family. He washed it in family. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, let's speak of the family. &gt;&gt; Let's go to the Bible. &gt;&gt; Genesis chapter 12. &gt;&gt; Are we going to speak a bit here and there in order to come to an end? We still have sufficient time. &gt;&gt; Genesis chapter 12. &gt;&gt; This is what God says. &gt;&gt; Now listen to what he says. &gt;&gt; Uh 12 verse one. &gt;&gt; The Lord had said to Abraham, "No, no, no, no pardon. &gt;&gt; No, no, please. I'm sorry. &gt;&gt; I was reading in Exodus. The Lord had said to Abraham, "Go from your country, your people, and your father's household to the land I will show you. I will make you into a great nation, and I will bless you. I will make your name great, and you'll be a blessing. &gt;&gt; Imagine it. &gt;&gt; Now, imagine &gt;&gt; a single man, &gt;&gt; that is to be a source, &gt;&gt; of a blessing. Now listen verse three. I will bless those &gt;&gt; who bless you and whoever curses you I will curse. Verse three. &gt;&gt; And all peoples on earth, &gt;&gt; in thee shall all families of the earth be blessed. &gt;&gt; Now imagine all the families of the earth &gt;&gt; will be blessed or are to be blessed thanks to one family. So first the blessing &gt;&gt; comes out of a single family from that single family. &gt;&gt; All other families on earth &gt;&gt; to be blessed thanks to that first family. That is why we all say &gt;&gt; that we are the children of Abraham. &gt;&gt; Now notice notice Abraham's a family is a blessed family faced and out of this family all other families will be blessed. &gt;&gt; Now notice that the natural typifies the supernatural. &gt;&gt; The natural shows what is in the supernatural. That is the reason why &gt;&gt; that Abraham's a family everything given to that family by God &gt;&gt; from that family that are blessings would spread and what are these blessings notice that in the plan of redemption all the spiritual blessings they are tied to Abraham am. That's why salvation, the salvation we looking for, the eternal life that we are looking for in the Old Testament, it was represented by the land of Canaan which is called a promised landm But notice that the promised land in the New Testament says, &gt;&gt; the promised land in the New Testament is the baptism of the Holy Spirit. &gt;&gt; The baptism of the Holy Spirit &gt;&gt; is our promised land. There there is where we go into. But notice &gt;&gt; this promised land. &gt;&gt; To whom was it given to first? To whom was it given? There's a promised land. &gt;&gt; God had given it to a single man &gt;&gt; to a family. And notice that out of that family, &gt;&gt; that family that was to possess the promised landm &gt;&gt; became an inheritance. So if we touch the inheritance, each inheritance, &gt;&gt; those that are to inherit, &gt;&gt; they must come out of that family. If you're not of that family, you cannot inherit anything. You cannot possess anything. You need to be out of that family to reach. So in the message adoption, &gt;&gt; adoption the second part I did not give this quotation but the brother can I give other quotations but the book of Ephesians is comparable to the book of Joshua &gt;&gt; preached on the 15th &gt;&gt; of May 1960. Evening evening in the morning, brother Bham preached the message the rejected king &gt;&gt; the same date. &gt;&gt; But here the book of &gt;&gt; is preached on the same day but in the evening. &gt;&gt; Now this is what the prophet says. &gt;&gt; It means adoption. The second part he says &gt;&gt; quotation 35. &gt;&gt; So then I typified this book &gt;&gt; with that of Joshua. &gt;&gt; If you notice, Israel came out of Egypt and on the journey they had this journey had three stages or three steps. The first stage &gt;&gt; was that which of Egypt, &gt;&gt; the next stage, &gt;&gt; the wilderness. And the third stage &gt;&gt; was a canon. While canon &gt;&gt; does not represent the age of millennium, &gt;&gt; but a canon rather represents &gt;&gt; the age of the overcomers, &gt;&gt; the dispensation of the victory because in a canon land they killed. &gt;&gt; They burnt the cities. They got they took a city but in the millennium there shall not be death &gt;&gt; and more &gt;&gt; canon &gt;&gt; what canon does shows us justification moving from Egypt all the way to the Red Sea &gt;&gt; getting through water. This represents justification by faith. after they had believed in Moses and decided to leave Egypt, &gt;&gt; sanctification. &gt;&gt; As they marched under the leadership of the purifier and under the atonement of the lamb sacrifice, &gt;&gt; the the sacrificial lamb &gt;&gt; in the wilderness. Then Then the third step they walked into the land &gt;&gt; which is a canon. Canon is a land is a land that which was promised. Now listen. Oh &gt;&gt; well. What is the land which had been a promise to believers today? &gt;&gt; To believers of the New Testament. What is the country? What is your land? &gt;&gt; What is your promised land? &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Says, &gt;&gt; he says, &gt;&gt; the promise &gt;&gt; is but the baptism of the Holy Spirit. That is the promise &gt;&gt; because to the last days &gt;&gt; Joel 2:28 says &gt;&gt; on the last days I will pour down on my of my spirit on all flesh. So canon land today is the baptism of the Holy Spirit. Now notice when the canon was the first a promise &gt;&gt; it was a promise to a man. Oh yes &gt;&gt; it was a family &gt;&gt; and that person was Abraham. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; It was a promise to Abraham. me. &gt;&gt; Abraham stood for a family &gt;&gt; and out of that &gt;&gt; out of that natural promise &gt;&gt; which was an inheritance to Abraham. &gt;&gt; Notice that inheritance moved or went from Abraham &gt;&gt; to Isaac. Moved from Abraham to Isaac. &gt;&gt; And who was Isaac? &gt;&gt; Abraham &gt;&gt; a son to Abraham. a family still. &gt;&gt; So he received it from notice &gt;&gt; after Isaac &gt;&gt; who came next &gt;&gt; Jacob &gt;&gt; and Esau &gt;&gt; Jacob gave us 12 sons. &gt;&gt; And these 12 sons &gt;&gt; are the ones that went to the promised land. &gt;&gt; And how do we call them? We call them a 12 tribes &gt;&gt; of Israel. &gt;&gt; What is this? &gt;&gt; A family. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; This is an inheritance. &gt;&gt; They reach the promised land and the God we worship. &gt;&gt; We call him, &gt;&gt; the God of Abraham, &gt;&gt; of Isaac, &gt;&gt; and the God of Israel. Can I hear you say amen? &gt;&gt; Notice now notice &gt;&gt; Jesus our redeemer when he comes where shall he Jesus came out of from among the 12 tribes of Israel. &gt;&gt; God wanted to kill the world &gt;&gt; in the days of Noah. Noah preached the word for 120 years. &gt;&gt; But how many were saved? &gt;&gt; A family. &gt;&gt; A family. &gt;&gt; That was a Noah &gt;&gt; and his three sons and their wives. &gt;&gt; Then Jesus said, "What happened in the days of Noah? Amen. &gt;&gt; So shall it to be for me &gt;&gt; a family. &gt;&gt; Are you with me still? &gt;&gt; Should we go back to the Garden of Eden? &gt;&gt; When the story of redemption started first started God planted on earth just a man &gt;&gt; and a woman, &gt;&gt; a family. And God is saying, &gt;&gt; "Be fruitful, &gt;&gt; increase in number and fill the earth." &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; And that man was Adam and Eve. &gt;&gt; That was a family. &gt;&gt; Where was it? Seth, &gt;&gt; where did Seth got his get his wife? &gt;&gt; Out of the same family. Even Cain, &gt;&gt; where did he get his wife? &gt;&gt; In that family, &gt;&gt; where will Jesus get his bride? &gt;&gt; Within the family, &gt;&gt; where did Abraham's wife come from? &gt;&gt; Who was Sarah? Sarah. &gt;&gt; Sarah. &gt;&gt; Was a step to Abraham. It was a family &gt;&gt; as you are. &gt;&gt; You were all of you within a man. You were all hidden in a man. You were all of you in out of his ministry. It's the only one he came that he preached. He preached and you started coming. This one from this side, that one from that side. Four, five, six, seven, one step at a time in a house [screaming] in a in a tent in a tabernacle and behind this we have a ministers, &gt;&gt; preachers, &gt;&gt; preachers. You would not have known me &gt;&gt; impossible if you have known me. &gt;&gt; It's a thanks to pastor a family which is a family. &gt;&gt; Can I hear you say amen out of the same that's why Jesus said that eternal life &gt;&gt; is an inheritance. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let's read it. &gt;&gt; Let's read it. &gt;&gt; This inheritance and the inheritance, &gt;&gt; it takes only those of the family if you're not a part of the family. &gt;&gt; You're not going to have your everlasting life. Everlasting life. &gt;&gt; It's a family inheritance. &gt;&gt; It's a family. uh in the book of Matthew chapter 19 verse &gt;&gt; let's begin with the verse 29 &gt;&gt; what does the Bible tell us 29 let's begin with uh 28 &gt;&gt; this is what it says uh &gt;&gt; 27 rather Peter answered him We have left everything &gt;&gt; to follow you. What then will they be for us? Jesus said to them, "Truly I tell you, at the renewal of all things, when the Son of Man sits on his glorious throne, you who have followed will also sit on 12 thrones judging the 12 tribes of Israel. And everyone who has left &gt;&gt; has left the houses. For my name is &gt;&gt; his brothers &gt;&gt; or sisters. Father &gt;&gt; or why or mother? &gt;&gt; Brother &gt;&gt; sir, &gt;&gt; sister &gt;&gt; mother &gt;&gt; or mother &gt;&gt; father &gt;&gt; a father &gt;&gt; both father mother uhh sons and daughters who who are they of which family are are they of the same family? What what member are they are they from? &gt;&gt; Both of the listed father, mother, son, daughters, they are members of one family. &gt;&gt; Am I right? &gt;&gt; When we when we say father, mother, &gt;&gt; father, mother, &gt;&gt; brother, &gt;&gt; brother &gt;&gt; or sister, sister, &gt;&gt; all the above. &gt;&gt; Who are they? Is it the government? No, &gt;&gt; no. &gt;&gt; But who are they? &gt;&gt; What is it? &gt;&gt; This is a family. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now listen. &gt;&gt; He says &gt;&gt; and his land &gt;&gt; and his houses shall receive a hundfold &gt;&gt; and shall inherit everlasting life. So eternal life is an inheritance belongs to a family. &gt;&gt; That is why it was Abraham who first received it. All Abraham's children they received it. Even Jesus Christ, &gt;&gt; he is the son of Abraham. &gt;&gt; Brother say he's got the four titles of the son. We call him son of Abraham as an heir to Palestine. &gt;&gt; Son of David, as an heir to the royal concession, &gt;&gt; son of man. He's an heir to the earth. Did did you know that Jesus is an heir? &gt;&gt; Did you know that we are joint hairs with Jesus? It's a family. Jesus is our elder brother or older brother. &gt;&gt; That is why he is our Abraham &gt;&gt; and we are Sarah's &gt;&gt; and Jesus takes us in marriage &gt;&gt; like as or his sister &gt;&gt; that's why Abraham &gt;&gt; could never rejected Sarah &gt;&gt; even though she could not give her birth no &gt;&gt; no no because &gt;&gt; because in one hand &gt;&gt; she stands for his wife &gt;&gt; on another hand &gt;&gt; she is a step sister &gt;&gt; a little sister so rejecting her so she may go. But where &gt;&gt; should Sarah leave Abraham's house? &gt;&gt; Where was she to go? &gt;&gt; In the house of their father and when the father calls Abraham come over here. I am going to sort out your matter yours is and this matter shall be dealt with in a family within a family. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That is why this is very important. It's a very important to understand the church of the new everything that I have shown you of the old testament the old testament &gt;&gt; is but the shadow of the new testament &gt;&gt; and the new testament is a shadow of the message of the end time. That is why you shall see that in the New Testament. &gt;&gt; Salvation is a matter of a family. &gt;&gt; The Holy Spirit &gt;&gt; is a family matter. &gt;&gt; Redemption and salvation. Redemption is for salvation. &gt;&gt; That's why God sent Moses Moses is a major prophet. &gt;&gt; But the person that God gives as a mouthpiece to Moses &gt;&gt; is the older brother to Moses. &gt;&gt; He is a priest. &gt;&gt; So if you there you would be like, "Wow, what's going on?" This one is the bigger brother, the one at the le. But how that was the family there? &gt;&gt; That was the shadow &gt;&gt; to show that &gt;&gt; Moses that represented Jesus in the New Testament. &gt;&gt; He utilized his apostles which were but his brothers. Jesus said, "I am no longer calling you brothers." &gt;&gt; Because they were brothers. &gt;&gt; They were the children of Israel. &gt;&gt; Jesus spoke. &gt;&gt; Apostles spoke in the state or in the place of Jesus. That's why it says the book of Matthew. &gt;&gt; Does this book belong to Matthew? No, no. &gt;&gt; These are the words of Jesus that Matthew utilized and he wrote them down. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; John the Baptist &gt;&gt; and Jesus. &gt;&gt; They were cousins. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? So I would like to show you that As a church, &gt;&gt; you stand for a family. &gt;&gt; And as a family, &gt;&gt; as a family, &gt;&gt; there's one thing you need to know. And that is &gt;&gt; that in a family &gt;&gt; things might happen. in a family. &gt;&gt; Things such as a sickness, &gt;&gt; such as a sickness, &gt;&gt; and it might also happen that within the family, you you you could have a a child within the family. which is born deaf and could not hear. &gt;&gt; Are you going to cast out that child? &gt;&gt; What? What would you do? You will work as hard as possible in order to for the child to retrieve the hearing site. It might also happen that within the family a child goes crazy &gt;&gt; but despite that &gt;&gt; he's still of the family &gt;&gt; and that child despite the fact that he's gone wild he's he's got a right to a claim to the inheritance. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Now listen. &gt;&gt; Within a family, &gt;&gt; there are some things that that are or they stand for the characteristics of that particular family. As a family, &gt;&gt; a church, &gt;&gt; you have your own characteristics. &gt;&gt; When somebody comes He looks at the brother remember. &gt;&gt; Are you from? Oh yes I am. &gt;&gt; Oh no. I could see I could tell. &gt;&gt; This is some characters of the family. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. But in a family for a family to stand for a long time within a family each know their position where they stand. &gt;&gt; This is very important. &gt;&gt; In a message they're taking sides with Jesus. preached on the 1st of June 1962 &gt;&gt; quotation 95am says this &gt;&gt; he says I am going to tell you something &gt;&gt; I'm going to tell you one thing at the &gt;&gt; at the Brham Brham's family &gt;&gt; we are nine Are you with me? &gt;&gt; There were nine in number. &gt;&gt; We are ninear &gt;&gt; and we would fight like the pet dogs. Pet dogs. &gt;&gt; Now notice like a little dogs we fight. When were they fighting? &gt;&gt; When they were still small, &gt;&gt; they were like a pet dogs. &gt;&gt; They were like small dogs. When you throw a piece of bread, a slice of bread, now they come. This one grabs that one grapes. &gt;&gt; Yes. This is a particular character &gt;&gt; of the family when children are still small. &gt;&gt; Can I hear you say amen to this? It means so when we child I remember when we were still young we could be on the table mom would come &gt;&gt; and then she puts bread slices of bread &gt;&gt; the same bread she places on the plate &gt;&gt; and places it there and he gives us a cup of tea all of that &gt;&gt; I've got a little brother just to tease him. &gt;&gt; I would take the bread &gt;&gt; which is the same bread. &gt;&gt; I would take it and say my bread is thicker than yours and he he cries, "Oh no, but how [screaming] how is it that man a bigger part than mine &gt;&gt; and I will keep on teasing you? This is a this is a bigger than yours and this is so sweet so tasty. So he would go crying and as he cries oh I felt comfortable because he was small he understood nothing but as mom would come mom would look at me you what's going on with you why are you disturbing your brother just leave him at ease &gt;&gt; and she looks at the other one why you crying &gt;&gt; it's the same bra can't you &gt;&gt; [cheering] &gt;&gt; character. &gt;&gt; This is a character &gt;&gt; of a children, small children. &gt;&gt; And you as you are not a church of a children, &gt;&gt; you are a church, &gt;&gt; a grown up church. many years in service. So it's a time now for you to show that you are adults. You are grown now. Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Adults. &gt;&gt; You are adult. &gt;&gt; It should not be a church where people are fasting for nothing. &gt;&gt; [cheering] &gt;&gt; Oh no this. Oh no that. Oh no this. No, [cheering] &gt;&gt; the owner of the church. &gt;&gt; He is the Lord Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Him. Jesus. Him. Jesus. &gt;&gt; Sent. He's the one that sent [cheering] Jesus. &gt;&gt; Sent God. How many here believe that Jesus is he that sent? &gt;&gt; Please show up. &gt;&gt; Please raise up your hands if you believe that Jesus sent. [cheering] &gt;&gt; [applause] &gt;&gt; Now listen to this one &gt;&gt; in the message possessing all things &gt;&gt; and this is what I'm going to read &gt;&gt; quotation 39 for me &gt;&gt; within a family We must know the place of each and every person &gt;&gt; and this is to avoid problems. &gt;&gt; Now listen, &gt;&gt; we could begin here right here. Quotation 39. &gt;&gt; I believe that I believe that when a God calls a man to a service Are we not getting projected &gt;&gt; possessing all things? &gt;&gt; Preached on the 6th of May 1962. &gt;&gt; Are you there? &gt;&gt; Okay. Yeah. I believe that when a God calls a man to service, &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; if he's a married man &gt;&gt; and has a hotmate, &gt;&gt; he calls his wife with him. Amen. &gt;&gt; No, I I expected a great amen. &gt;&gt; No, your amen did not convince me. &gt;&gt; Please throw an amen, a huge amen to this. This is what says in order for a man &gt;&gt; to do great achievement, &gt;&gt; he must have behind him a sustaining wife, a wife that supports him. &gt;&gt; Otherwise, he will never achieve. He he will achieve nothing. &gt;&gt; I am married. &gt;&gt; My wife is over there. &gt;&gt; If she makes me feel uncomfortable and she's always causing trouble, disturbing me all the time. You would see me here behind the pulpit but in a bad mood. &gt;&gt; An angry man. &gt;&gt; That is why when you see a great man of God, &gt;&gt; respect his wife as well. &gt;&gt; This is a very important. These are not my words and my statements. Brother Brandham says so. Now listen, he says if he's a a married man and has a helpmate, he calls his wife with him because they how are they over there? that two are one. They are one. That is why my beloved brothers and sisters, &gt;&gt; this is the character of the family. If it's in a family or always a father and mother fighting all the time, &gt;&gt; that family will be divided. Half of the children will stay with the father, stick with the father. Others they will stick with the mother. &gt;&gt; That is why you've you you are you you are left as a family. In a in a way it shows in a way that the man that you respected respect &gt;&gt; the same way you respected him respect his wife as well. respect her in the same manner. This is very important. &gt;&gt; And in a family, &gt;&gt; a father &gt;&gt; has his co-workers, &gt;&gt; a father's friends, colleagues and amongst the children. &gt;&gt; It might happen that a father trust one child. It doesn't mean that he hates others, &gt;&gt; but he trusts one child &gt;&gt; because he knows &gt;&gt; that this child &gt;&gt; is smart. &gt;&gt; This one, &gt;&gt; he's got maturity. Mother on the other side, &gt;&gt; she [snorts] is obligated or duty bound to respect that child. &gt;&gt; Mama, the mother &gt;&gt; must also respect the father's co-workers &gt;&gt; because these are but collaborators. &gt;&gt; Are you still with me? So the mother &gt;&gt; master respect them &gt;&gt; you too &gt;&gt; respect the mother &gt;&gt; and the brother says &gt;&gt; if you claim to love me &gt;&gt; love my family [applause] &gt;&gt; love my family if I happen to love pastor &gt;&gt; the same love I projected Because you are pastor Kodima's a family &gt;&gt; the children pastor's children &gt;&gt; he biological children they must know as a family do you say amen to this so you shall see This is my advice. &gt;&gt; Remember I said in the beginning, it's an advice. &gt;&gt; Every time I give you an advice, &gt;&gt; it's up to you &gt;&gt; to take it or to reject it. &gt;&gt; Should you reject it? &gt;&gt; Keep this in mind. There's a consequences, &gt;&gt; but should you get them, consequence. &gt;&gt; There's also consequences &gt;&gt; as a family be mature children that have grown up. &gt;&gt; Now listen, we used to fight. Please get that quotation. &gt;&gt; We used to fight by taking sight like a pet dog. But after all, &gt;&gt; please get the quotation with Jesus. But after all, &gt;&gt; once the fight is over, we remained br still. &gt;&gt; We were still br Now listen. &gt;&gt; One knew that the other one was Abraham here &gt;&gt; as a family. &gt;&gt; All of you. &gt;&gt; Your master recognize each other. You recognize this one is my brother. She is my sister. &gt;&gt; If he is your brother &gt;&gt; and that she is your sister, &gt;&gt; so why would you criticize them in your natural family? Can you do that? &gt;&gt; My my own father. &gt;&gt; He may be a drunkard. a heavy drinker. He comes home drunk, &gt;&gt; but he's still my father. &gt;&gt; He's my father. &gt;&gt; I will never allow anyone &gt;&gt; to play around with my father. &gt;&gt; I will never accept that. [cheering] &gt;&gt; My brother, &gt;&gt; he might be crazy. And he's that the crazy one, the crippled one. He doesn't speak. He's at home, &gt;&gt; but he's still my brother. &gt;&gt; He is my brother. &gt;&gt; I pray for him. &gt;&gt; Now listen to brother Brham. &gt;&gt; And I knew there were broms. Uh he knowed was a brom. See But we will fight &gt;&gt; you too in your own family. &gt;&gt; There's some uh useless fight, some fussing. That's the reason why I spoke of why despite the fights, but I will never take out the knife to kill my own brother. No, this &gt;&gt; I become like a Kane of all &gt;&gt; and as soon as I become like Kane, &gt;&gt; it shows plainly &gt;&gt; that a Cain &gt;&gt; and Abel, it shows that both Cain and Abel did not have the same father. &gt;&gt; They did not have the same father. That is why Cain's father is the serpent, &gt;&gt; the devil. &gt;&gt; That is why &gt;&gt; he killed his brother. &gt;&gt; He You can't kill your own brother. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In a family, &gt;&gt; problems will always be there. Show me here a person who's got a family &gt;&gt; and that they never had problems in that family anyone like &gt;&gt; it does not exist. That family does not exist &gt;&gt; but we bear with each other. &gt;&gt; We love each other &gt;&gt; and we support each other. If your brother is a crippled man, he can hardly walk &gt;&gt; and that you see your that your brother is on the stage &gt;&gt; to move from up there over here. He can hardly make it. What will you say? Will you say try your utmost and come down? &gt;&gt; Will you say that? &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; What are you going to say? &gt;&gt; You you started climbing backward &gt;&gt; backward &gt;&gt; backward &gt;&gt; backward &gt;&gt; backward. I said brother let me piggy back you. He comes up &gt;&gt; then I carries him. I carry him one step at a time with my brother. &gt;&gt; One step at a time. One step at a time. &gt;&gt; One step at a time. Slow &gt;&gt; until I drop him down. Can I climb up there and I piggy back him? The minute I piggy back him, I say you. You remember the other day you say the nonsense to me. You will see I'm going to No, &gt;&gt; will I be able to do that? &gt;&gt; I cannot do it. &gt;&gt; But why would it be that? &gt;&gt; You are able to do it. You are a family. &gt;&gt; You are a family. &gt;&gt; In a family. &gt;&gt; In a family. Some people &gt;&gt; they are talkative &gt;&gt; whenever you you around them they they're talkative they talk should they be talkative but of the word even though they are talkative as long as they are talkative in the word speaking of the word let leave them alone &gt;&gt; this is what they have as character Some they are the quiet tribe. There is an issue in the church. He's there. He says nothing. &gt;&gt; He says nothing. You ask a question. What is your opinion on this issue? You have nothing to say. That is his character. No. Why is it that you are always the quiet one? You're always like this. No. No. It doesn't mean everybody will speak in the same manner. All around the throne &gt;&gt; around the throne &gt;&gt; around the throne of Jesus Christ we see four creatures four creatures there was the first one the spirit of an ox which stand for sacrifice he may be criticized he may be even spoken out for but he says nothing is there you move from You find a man first. Let's let's begin with the lion. &gt;&gt; The lion is that the angry man, somebody [laughter] he speaks, he shouts, he screams, he speaks. When somebody comes in the family to create some troubles in the family. A person like that, you're not going to get a lamb to fight against him. No. &gt;&gt; No. Since there's a troublemaker in the family, you came to the family, we're going to call the lion of the family. And when the lion comes, you he will scream that big voice. That is his character. But when amongst the children there's another one that goes high, we call a lamb. to come. My brother, why are you screaming so loud? Please come down. Please come down. Whole job is why are you always that is his nature as a lamb. &gt;&gt; And after the lamb and the lion, we've got a man. &gt;&gt; A manigence stands for intelligence, &gt;&gt; wisdom, Say this one &gt;&gt; when a father looks he say this child &gt;&gt; is very smart &gt;&gt; father would want to go out &gt;&gt; say come over here I'm going to the bank can you escort me I am fixing to purchase this one today please escort me please just write because he's a very smart even at school. He says, "Okay, can you write it down? &gt;&gt; Don't be jealous. &gt;&gt; Don't you ever be jealous." &gt;&gt; Oh no, father. Why is it that always him only him? &gt;&gt; When the father goes, the father goes a day with him. The father goes that day with him. No, bear with them in that. &gt;&gt; Can I hear you say amen to that? &gt;&gt; Uh, what is your name? &gt;&gt; Samuel. &gt;&gt; Samuel. Samuel. &gt;&gt; Why always Samuel? &gt;&gt; The other one. &gt;&gt; My name is Paul. My name is Paul. &gt;&gt; Why only him? &gt;&gt; Why only the other one? They are family members. &gt;&gt; They are family members. &gt;&gt; He is an an older brother, a bigger brother. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Why only brother? He is of the family. Why only son? &gt;&gt; Especially that one over there. &gt;&gt; But who was the Solomon of old? &gt;&gt; Was he not David's own son? &gt;&gt; Was he not David's son? &gt;&gt; So we must keep in mind that we are a family. I may not be able to finish off all the four points that I mentioned, &gt;&gt; but this is very important. Listen, I I know I they knew that I was a Braham. You see, &gt;&gt; but still we couldn't fight. You two in your family, you also do the same. &gt;&gt; But they are your brothers still. &gt;&gt; They are your brothers. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; That's the way it is. We might have some uh we might we might different. &gt;&gt; We might different between us. &gt;&gt; That's all right. &gt;&gt; Correct. &gt;&gt; That's all right. that there's an issue comes up &gt;&gt; and a brother stands up and say I'm not I'm against this don't go don't go and gossip why did he say he's not against is against this normal &gt;&gt; no this is a normal as a family &gt;&gt; see that's right &gt;&gt; normal &gt;&gt; here it says it's in the French translation says said that's all right. Which is the same translation as over there. That's all right. &gt;&gt; This is in order. &gt;&gt; We are one. &gt;&gt; We one in Christ. &gt;&gt; We believe this message. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now notice &gt;&gt; as Brhams grew up &gt;&gt; and that they left the stage of a childhood, &gt;&gt; they would not come together as pets dogs fighting as they did when they were small. &gt;&gt; They would come like adult. They will show up like adult. This one comes driving. &gt;&gt; This one comes on the bike. &gt;&gt; Another one comes walking with his wife. &gt;&gt; The other one comes from this direction. Here they come. They sit and table a family meeting. says in a message why Christ speak &gt;&gt; preached on the 14th of July 1963 14th of July 1963 quotation seven now about a little family meeting today I happened to meet my brothers at home. &gt;&gt; At my sister's house. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Where were they having a meeting? &gt;&gt; In a house of his little sister as the first born of the family. And in a family complex we need to avoid having some behaviors that are complex behaviors only. &gt;&gt; You know I am look at brother as the older brother he accept that the family meeting &gt;&gt; should happen in the house of his little sister. He could have said, "You are a woman. I am the man of the family. You know, everyone, I want to see you at my house." But here, brother, &gt;&gt; in the house of my little sister and certain of our parents that are living in the neighborhood, &gt;&gt; the big team of Branhams This is the big team of mood. &gt;&gt; Others are coming from different places from provinces from rural areas. They coming together. They coming together as unity not in order to fight. &gt;&gt; Fighting is when we were small. &gt;&gt; But right now we are adults. We sit. We sit then. How do you do? Oh, how is everything going on at at your house? &gt;&gt; So happy to see you. How do you do? &gt;&gt; I'm so very well. Ah, he gracious one. How are you doing? How is everyone over? How's your son? &gt;&gt; And how's that one over there? &gt;&gt; I haven't seen him in a while. He greets this one. He greets his young despite the fact he's young. I might since he's young. I might give that one and shake. How are you? You see &gt;&gt; and over here ah this is the elder. &gt;&gt; This is the dean. &gt;&gt; And when I come close Oh my [screaming and groaning] dear elder. &gt;&gt; This is a this is an elder. It's a family. &gt;&gt; When we come together, it's not in order to fight &gt;&gt; because we are now adults. &gt;&gt; Melody has a grown up. [cheering and applause] &gt;&gt; This is how you should walk. He says &gt;&gt; the bigger team of Brham &gt;&gt; should they all come to Kentucky here if all of the family I believe that we would have to to hire the entire city are many He speak about the biological family. He says there were many and this day &gt;&gt; it's not a little family. &gt;&gt; It's a great family, big family. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That we would have to hide the entire city. There are many but This is only a little coming back home. So those that were married, those that had left, those that went to other provinces, they relocated, doctors, nurses, everyone. Should they come together? Everyone. And let me ask a question. As the Brandhams come back, &gt;&gt; as they come back, what do they do? As they come together, they display unity. &gt;&gt; That's showing that despite the fact that we are no longer living in the same house, &gt;&gt; but still we won. We won still. We will always be back home. He says, &gt;&gt; he says a little back home. &gt;&gt; Now listen to this part here. &gt;&gt; Often times we would meet at my father's mother's house. Okay. We used to all meet at mama's house. And she was the old type that held us together kind of. Who was the mother or what was she? &gt;&gt; She was a typost. &gt;&gt; It means every single one would come around around her. Amen. &gt;&gt; And he says something. &gt;&gt; She was she held us together kind of. But the God had taken the typost to heaven. The type that God taken to heaven is typost. &gt;&gt; Who is the typost? Who is he that assembled everyone? &gt;&gt; Who was the head of this church? that is being now taken to heaven. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; The tie post is a pastor. He's the one on whom everyone held, everyone around him. But notice when a mother was taken to heaven where were Brandhams divided or did they get divided? Notice &gt;&gt; even though the mother was taken to heaven, they all came together reunion in the house of a little h brother, brother Lo. &gt;&gt; His name just skipped my mind. A little brother to brother. They went there showing that despite the fact that mama is no longer there, &gt;&gt; but we remain a brand family and we stick together despite the fact that no longer there must remained. a family. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He says and I believe that one day all of us will meet they up in heaven. &gt;&gt; But if you have to tear each artist down You are fighting one against another. You are destroying each other. &gt;&gt; I'm being honest with you this morning. Kodima is already in heaven. But if you do not show the sign of maturity, others won't see him. Some will not see him. You remain here. You remain behind the house or this househ we built it there this speaker I I purchased them we do not fight for earthly things our fight &gt;&gt; is to go to heaven &gt;&gt; don't you ever forget This &gt;&gt; don't you ever forget this advice. &gt;&gt; The adi the advice is advice. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Banana says this. He has spoken in many places. But first I'll take this one. &gt;&gt; I'm singling out. I'm taking one point for the next segment. &gt;&gt; These other points you have a big picture. You can feel let's speak of unity. Oneness. &gt;&gt; Now listen to me. &gt;&gt; Unity. This is a a great venture for a family, &gt;&gt; a divided family. will perish. &gt;&gt; It will never stand. &gt;&gt; Now listen to me. &gt;&gt; This day Donald Trump, &gt;&gt; Donald the Trump is h catching the people that are coming to America &gt;&gt; to send them back home to their own country. Those that went to America. Is a Donald Trump really an American? &gt;&gt; Brother says the genuine Americans are Indians. He says, "But how did Indians forfeit their country when white people came all the way from Europe &gt;&gt; and they landed in America? Indians &gt;&gt; were first united. &gt;&gt; They had a leader &gt;&gt; by the name of Jeronimo. &gt;&gt; Jeronimo was like a a chief unto them, the king unto them. They did not have a weapon, sophisticated weapon. There were there were needy people. The people that were living according to the customs, &gt;&gt; they were living according to their customs. &gt;&gt; They survived the thanks to the skins of animals. They would kill an animal, a buffalo. They would eat the meat. They would take the fats &gt;&gt; to make clothes out of that. But a white man, what did he do? He divided Indians. &gt;&gt; And after dividing Indians, they got hold of the country up until today. &gt;&gt; Indians are in a minority, few in number. Never. When they take the country back, &gt;&gt; it's over. What d what is it that destroy the Indians? &gt;&gt; The vision &gt;&gt; the vision &gt;&gt; that's not a buildup. Now listen to me. &gt;&gt; God is the Almighty. &gt;&gt; But we see some points in the Bible &gt;&gt; whereby God becomes incap incapable or powerless. When you touch that point, God becomes powerless. And what is what are those points? What is that point? &gt;&gt; God has got weak points. to an extent that when you touch that weak point, &gt;&gt; God becomes a powerless &gt;&gt; amongst the weaknesses. &gt;&gt; God becomes so weak, powerless before his word. It is a truth that God is a powerful but when you present the word to God, &gt;&gt; God becomes weak. He will do nothing. That's what brotherham says. Brother preach the message of taking God at his own word. Should you desire something from God, present the word. Lord, this is what is written. &gt;&gt; It is written. It is written. God becomes weak. He will give your heart desire &gt;&gt; and another point &gt;&gt; which weakens the God &gt;&gt; unity. Amen. &gt;&gt; When the people are united &gt;&gt; so united welded let's read the Bible in Genesis. &gt;&gt; This is where I'm going to to finish off. I'm going to read in Genesis &gt;&gt; because my two hours have come to an end. I've got five minutes left. Listen to what &gt;&gt; Genesis chapter 11. &gt;&gt; This is what the Bible says. &gt;&gt; Verse one. Oh yes. Now the whole world had one language &gt;&gt; and a common speech. As the people moved east toward, &gt;&gt; they found a plane in a in a in a shiner &gt;&gt; and settled there. They say to each other, "Come, &gt;&gt; let's make bricks &gt;&gt; and bake them thoroughly. Uh, bear with me. I misread here. They use the brick instead of stone and tar for motor. Then they say it again, come, &gt;&gt; let us build ourselves a city with a tower that reaches to the heavens so that we may make a name, a name for ourselves, otherwise we will be scattered over the face of the whole earth. &gt;&gt; Verse five, But the Lord came down. The Lord came down to see the city and the tower the people were building. &gt;&gt; Verse six. And I want that everyone to read that &gt;&gt; as it is done in a kinder dart. um in English &gt;&gt; in read out of your own Bible verse six. &gt;&gt; Now I am your teacher &gt;&gt; that's in the crash. &gt;&gt; I'll be counting from one to three. When I get to three, you start reading. &gt;&gt; One 2 3 The Lord said if there's one people speaking the same language they have begun to do this then nothing they plan to do would be impossible for them. verse seven. &gt;&gt; Understand each other. &gt;&gt; Understand each other. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now listen to God. The Lord said, &gt;&gt; the Lord said, see, &gt;&gt; see they are building, making up one people. &gt;&gt; How many peoples? &gt;&gt; One. &gt;&gt; And all have a common speech. And of that which they have undertaken to do no &gt;&gt; nothing will hinder them to do according to their plan. &gt;&gt; God the Almighty &gt;&gt; here he acknowledges he recognizes that is seeing that they are making up one people and then they speak the same language. Nothing will stop them. Nothing will stop them from achieving what they have as a plan. One less God is the Almighty. He could just blow up blow so that the tower could not reach the heaven. He could uh even send the thunders in such a way that after they had erected the tower like uh it was with the walls of Jericho, &gt;&gt; he could easily have sand to break them. But God says, but God said that which they have in mind of doing they will make it. Even if I send thunders and that the walls come the walls come tumbling down. They will rebuild the walls. I may send rain to destroy the house. But since they are still one, they will rebuild again. What I can do right now for them to fail, &gt;&gt; I have to divide them. &gt;&gt; Divide them. And how did God do it? God simply sent a language &gt;&gt; and he shared he divided languages. Now it becomes &gt;&gt; when I say good morning, &gt;&gt; the other one say, &gt;&gt; "What did you say?" &gt;&gt; You see, we hardly can hear each other. When I say to this one, "Please hand me over a brick." In English, he hears as if &gt;&gt; I said, "Hey, pull me from my foot and drop me down. So now this is a confusion. &gt;&gt; So now people would come together. &gt;&gt; He that hears this one's language they come together. &gt;&gt; Now this this is a group they understand each other well &gt;&gt; group. You see now it's become this is divided &gt;&gt; in many groups no more a way out others would say let's carry on with building &gt;&gt; others would say no stop it &gt;&gt; up until today the Babylon tower had never been completed it has it became babel And a babel means confusion. That's it. &gt;&gt; So should you get divided, &gt;&gt; you will go nowhere. &gt;&gt; Thus shall become Babylon. &gt;&gt; And what is Babylon? Confusion. this one will say no I want this one even when you will get to a point of voting for a pastor pastor a group would be like we want this one another one we want that one we want this one we want this and what shall it beus &gt;&gt; confusion that's why &gt;&gt; unity Unity &gt;&gt; is a very important. &gt;&gt; That's why brother in order to put an end to my preaching &gt;&gt; with regard to the unity provokey says unity provokes harmony. ceremony. It says in a message of oneness 1962 he says &gt;&gt; he says &gt;&gt; any man with his family &gt;&gt; quotation 15 he says correct &gt;&gt; any man and his family correct and good &gt;&gt; good &gt;&gt; obedient family is one with another is a one with another family. &gt;&gt; And if there's a &gt;&gt; And if there's something in the family that moves, &gt;&gt; then it's not right. &gt;&gt; We we should never be divided. &gt;&gt; The family is broken somewhere. somewhere &gt;&gt; they should all be one. &gt;&gt; Father with mother, &gt;&gt; the mother with the father, children with the parents, &gt;&gt; parent with the children, all in in agreement. And when you see that, &gt;&gt; you will see a lovely picture. &gt;&gt; That's it. &gt;&gt; A lovely picture. &gt;&gt; Quotation 17. &gt;&gt; He says, &gt;&gt; well, now Jesus prayed. Jesus prayed in John 17 and verse 11 &gt;&gt; 11th verse to you who put down these Sunday school texts I have many of them this morning John 17:11 Jesus prayed &gt;&gt; that a church &gt;&gt; and he would be one like a he &gt;&gt; and a father. We're one. &gt;&gt; That a church. We as a members of the body of Christ would be one &gt;&gt; together just like he and the father are one. &gt;&gt; And at that day we wouldn't know that he was in the father rather father in him &gt;&gt; and he in us. that together we are we were one. &gt;&gt; What a union. &gt;&gt; What a oneness that would be &gt;&gt; to see God in his church. Amen. &gt;&gt; Till every member &gt;&gt; is a jester perfectly in harmony. Amen. &gt;&gt; Perfect harmony. &gt;&gt; Perfect harmony. &gt;&gt; Let me emphasize on this. Perfect harmony. &gt;&gt; Are you with me? &gt;&gt; Perfect harmony. &gt;&gt; Perfect harmony. &gt;&gt; You see today people are matching clothes. They are in harmony with clothes. Let me not go far. Uh here is a blue blazer suit &gt;&gt; and you as you can see a tie with some blue spots. &gt;&gt; As you can see blue socks. &gt;&gt; What are we looking for? Harmony. Lord my wish. My desire is that each member may you live in harmony. May you all live in harmony. &gt;&gt; So then my beloved brothers for that harmony to exist among us. No matter what your brother has done, we are living in the days of Yumip. The message of the end time &gt;&gt; is a message of Yomipur is a message of pardon, everything he has done, I've got some quotations, but the hour is he might have stolen something. He might have criticized you. He might have insulted you. But if you desire harmony, &gt;&gt; do as Jesus did. As Jesus was climbing on the cross, who uh h who delivered Jesus, who surrendered Jesus, that was his own brother out of the same tribe of Judah. As Jesus was climbing the mountain, Jesus looks &gt;&gt; and he says, "Father, father," &gt;&gt; he never said, "Send them to hell. &gt;&gt; See how she's handing me over to be killed. They have I have seen flames from them. I have suffered. Send them to hell." &gt;&gt; What did he say? &gt;&gt; Father, father, &gt;&gt; forgive them. [cheering] Father forgive them. &gt;&gt; So then &gt;&gt; should your sister have wronged you, &gt;&gt; forgive them. This is a day of your husband has a chance of grace against you. Forgive him. Your children have wronged you. Forgive them. Love one another. &gt;&gt; And also support your pastor's affair. Pastor, &gt;&gt; the pastor's a family. &gt;&gt; Support the church. &gt;&gt; This is your family. &gt;&gt; Ministers, support them. Support the people of God. &gt;&gt; You as the people support these men and these men support the church. Harmony. Harmony. Walk in harmony. May the Lord bless you.

Can you come and pray for them? Baba. Okay, let's bow our head. Mighty God, eternal father, it's your word that that spoke about the massive and great promises. The promise was that they should repent and be baptized in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ for the remission of the sins. Then you will give them a gift, Father. That gift is the gift of the Holy Spirit. And that spirit will give them the knowledge and understanding. Father, backing up, Lord Almighty, laying a foundation, Lord Almighty, until they grow to their uh perfection, gracious Lord, it is that spirit, Lord Almighty, that will give them that type of growth. So we we have done our physical thing in taking the body uh just to show that dip him in the water is that the old man dies and picking him up is that now is now a new man &gt;&gt; and that new man is would be the heavenly one that will be built by the word that will be preached on him. So we commit them unto thee Lord Almighty. We know that the step that they have taken. It's like joining an army. The devil is not happy about it. So we pray Lord that you protect them Lord as they will be growing in the Lord. Give them the understanding Lord and give them the the revelation so that tomorrow they might stand Lord and affirm the word in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ we pray. Amen. Amen.
