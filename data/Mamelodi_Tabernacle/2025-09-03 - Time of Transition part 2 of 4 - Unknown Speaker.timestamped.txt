[8:51] &gt;&gt; That's why now a man can crack his
[8:54] his head.

[9:00] say there's no seals. Yeah.
[9:02] &gt;&gt; The other one says this and that

[11:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[11:05] &gt;&gt; Brother, the people today don't know

[13:20] &gt;&gt; him. Amen.
[13:23] &gt;&gt; Right.
[13:24] Oh,
[13:27] &gt;&gt; now
[13:29] let me quote it. Meanwhile,
[13:34] it says now John
[13:38] &gt;&gt; wouldn't recognize Jesus
[13:40] &gt;&gt; standing
[13:44] &gt;&gt; because he was a man.
[13:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[13:48] &gt;&gt; Now it says e
[13:52] looked ordinary.
[13:55] to

[13:59] but let me just quote it to you."
[14:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. I will just quote it to you
[14:04] because I've got it here. John the
[14:07] Baptist,
[14:08] &gt;&gt; that great prophet
[14:12] &gt;&gt; that came forth and said,
[14:14] &gt;&gt; "There is one standing among you right
[14:17] now,
[14:19] &gt;&gt; an ordinary man."
[14:22] &gt;&gt; Standing
[14:24] &gt;&gt; here somewhere. Amen.
[14:26] &gt;&gt; Now John said there's one standing among
[14:29] you.
[14:31] [Music]
[14:32] &gt;&gt; So people could look around.
[14:36] &gt;&gt; Which one?
[14:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:44] &gt;&gt; But then it there must be a way for John
[14:47] to see him. Amen.
[14:52] &gt;&gt; John will be standing there
[14:55] &gt;&gt; until he's buried.
[14:56] &gt;&gt; Exactly.
[14:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:00] &gt;&gt; People
[15:02] &gt;&gt; remain in the churches for years
[15:06] &gt;&gt; and not met Christ.
[15:10] [Applause]
[15:13] Amen. Yeah.
[15:15] Amen. H the theme the purpose of the
[15:21] word
[15:23] &gt;&gt; is is not just to become an orator
[15:30] &gt;&gt; the purpose is for the people
[15:32] &gt;&gt; to meet God
[15:35] [Applause]
[15:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[15:46] Amen.
[15:49] &gt;&gt; I was saying that if you can
[15:53] take a group of people
[15:55] &gt;&gt; and ask them to sing
[15:57] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[15:58] And everyone becomes a hero.
[16:07] You know they are standing so the
[16:10] cameras after that h
[16:14] the adjudicator will shake all all the
[16:18] hands
[16:22] &gt;&gt; but some of them
[16:25] &gt;&gt; if you want to hear
[16:28] &gt;&gt; you must ask them to sing one word.
[16:37] Amen.
[16:38] &gt;&gt; That's when you realize that
[16:42] &gt;&gt; being among many people, you can be
[16:45] counted as a healer.
[16:50] &gt;&gt; Some people
[16:52] &gt;&gt; in the church
[16:54] &gt;&gt; they are also Christians,
[16:58] &gt;&gt; right?
[16:59] But let him be found alone.
[17:10] &gt;&gt; That is something.
[17:13] [Music]
[17:16] Right.
[17:17] &gt;&gt; Right.
[17:18] &gt;&gt; So
[17:19] John the Baptist, that great prophet
[17:22] that come forth said there is one
[17:24] standing among you right now.
[17:27] &gt;&gt; An ordinary man.
[17:29] &gt;&gt; That's the love of God.
[17:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[17:31] &gt;&gt; John said, "I bore record. I bear
[17:34] record. I saw the spirit of God and the
[17:36] Holy Ghost descending from heaven like a
[17:39] dove
[17:40] &gt;&gt; and it went upon him
[17:42] &gt;&gt; and a voice said this is my beloved my
[17:45] beloved son in whom I'm pleased.
[17:47] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[17:48] &gt;&gt; And uh
[17:50] e what was it?
[17:52] &gt;&gt; He says look John the Baptist would
[17:55] never have known Jesus.
[17:57] &gt;&gt; Yes. If it if it hadn't been a for the
[18:02] Holy Ghost pointing
[18:05] [Music]
[18:08] &gt;&gt; amen.
[18:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:11] &gt;&gt; No one could come by looking at him and
[18:14] say I can see if you are Jesus.
[18:19] &gt;&gt; That's why they missed him.
[18:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:23] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[18:23] &gt;&gt; They couldn't find him because he was a
[18:25] man working.
[18:27] Amen.
[18:28] &gt;&gt; Sometimes he was even penniless.
[18:33] [Applause]
[18:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[18:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[18:37] &gt;&gt; You know now a canon man
[18:40] &gt;&gt; walking beside the Lord Jesus
[18:42] &gt;&gt; and he cast a fig tree because there was
[18:46] no fig and he was angry.
[18:48] angry.
[18:49] &gt;&gt; So a young man would say this is
[18:59] &gt;&gt; today you are driving in a car.
[19:10] &gt;&gt; The disciples were
[19:12] &gt;&gt; Oh my god. And that day had their
[19:16] gray lips

[19:37] [Music]
[19:39] &gt;&gt; metropolitan cities.
[19:40] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[19:41] &gt;&gt; Okay. Once there's no relish in the
[19:43] house, they think there's no God

[25:09] the one you get from the field.

[25:26] &gt;&gt; All right.
[25:28] &gt;&gt; You don't need to spice it.
[25:31] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.

[25:46] now uh here we are yesterday we were
[25:50] here
[25:51] &gt;&gt; Amen
[25:51] &gt;&gt; now here's the place where h sometimes
[25:55] the people
[25:57] &gt;&gt; h they come to a breakdown
[26:01] &gt;&gt; all right
[26:02] &gt;&gt; that is at the end of the seven church
[26:05] Yeah. Yeah.
[26:07] &gt;&gt; Now at the end of the seventh church
[26:10] age.
[26:11] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[26:11] &gt;&gt; H we see the prophet brother.

[26:24] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[26:25] &gt;&gt; To
[26:28] Christ. Amen.
[26:30] &gt;&gt; Now we are going to look at why brother
[26:35] he doesn't say Jesus is the mystery of
[26:40] &gt;&gt; no
[26:41] &gt;&gt; Jesus is the container
[26:47] &gt;&gt; because he took the book from within
[26:50] himself which was not in a book form
[26:53] because it was written recently
[26:56] &gt;&gt; and we call it a book.
[27:00] That is the very same book forbidden to
[27:03] write.
[27:09] &gt;&gt; And you that you possess
[27:15] [Applause]
[27:17] [Music]
[27:33] us to sing to the Lord.
[27:37] &gt;&gt; And yes to the Lord.
[27:40] &gt;&gt; But this is the greatest angel of all
[27:43] the ages.
[27:48] &gt;&gt; Says the people who went before are
[27:52] waiting upon us. Amen.
[27:56] &gt;&gt; We are the cap of the whole
[28:03] &gt;&gt; pastor.
[28:04] &gt;&gt; Now what kind of people ought we to be
[28:11] &gt;&gt; here? The ministry that is here.
[28:14] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[28:17] The pastor here
[28:20] has got a ministry
[28:23] &gt;&gt; and
[28:24] he he can preach to Paul and Peter
[28:33] &gt;&gt; because they were anticipating
[28:38] &gt;&gt; they were looking forward to
[28:41] &gt;&gt; that's why Paul says of the coming of
[28:43] the Lord
[28:45] &gt;&gt; no one should deceive you.
[28:48] Because Paul saw it coming down.
[28:55] &gt;&gt; So he knew there must be a minister
[28:58] there
[29:00] &gt;&gt; to announce his immediate.
[29:06] &gt;&gt; Amen. So the ministry here I can
[29:11] take the book and go to Peter and say
[29:14] Peter
[29:15] [Music]
[29:21] &gt;&gt; that thing is here
[29:29] you sometimes wonder
[29:31] &gt;&gt; why the people
[29:33] &gt;&gt; why
[29:35] Here's John.
[29:37] &gt;&gt; Let's look at the Here is John.
[29:40] John chapter one. He says, "I never knew
[29:44] him."
[29:45] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[29:45] &gt;&gt; John himself, you say, "I never knew
[29:48] him."
[29:48] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[29:48] &gt;&gt; But the one who sent me
[29:51] &gt;&gt; told me that the one whom I will see a
[29:56] light of
[29:59] resting upon.
[30:01] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[30:02] &gt;&gt; Okay. Amen.
[30:04] &gt;&gt; Now, let's look at it. Now, here is
[30:07] Jesus standing there. John know him.
[30:09] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[30:11] &gt;&gt; The only way he can know him
[30:14] &gt;&gt; is for the supernatural to come.
[30:18] &gt;&gt; Because
[30:20] the thing John must forun is this one.
[30:30] [Music]
[30:33] But now the supernatural was put in the
[30:35] body.
[30:37] &gt;&gt; Now when Jesus standing there, John was
[30:40] looking at Jesus at the people waiting
[30:44] for the other part
[30:47] &gt;&gt; which has a a a twofold being
[30:52] &gt;&gt; like we are.
[30:54] &gt;&gt; One part is the seven changes, one part
[30:57] is the six. Amen.
[30:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[30:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:01] &gt;&gt; So you won't see the seals
[31:06] like as you see the the seven changes.
[31:10] &gt;&gt; No,
[31:11] &gt;&gt; one is time, one is
[31:15] &gt;&gt; the seven church ages. That's why we
[31:17] have so many preachers.
[31:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. Some are going this way this way
[31:25] because it's time is ages.
[31:30] &gt;&gt; Now senses are active.
[31:36] &gt;&gt; That's why we have we have Bethl, Jero,
[31:41] Jordan,
[31:43] &gt;&gt; but Elisha was not part of it.
[31:50] Noise
[31:51] &gt;&gt; Elishah walked inwardly.
[31:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:56] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[31:56] &gt;&gt; He saw what was in.
[32:00] &gt;&gt; So he followed Elijah because he saw
[32:03] what was in.
[32:05] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:06] &gt;&gt; He was an insider.
[32:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:10] &gt;&gt; When they reach Jordan
[32:13] &gt;&gt; saw uh they they crossed over. Yeah.
[32:17] &gt;&gt; So a bigger numberantity
[32:23] &gt;&gt; remained this side of
[32:25] &gt;&gt; Jordan
[32:26] [Music]
[32:27] &gt;&gt; and cross.
[32:32] &gt;&gt; Now Elishah was not just a believer.
[32:37] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[32:37] &gt;&gt; He was a believer with a people.
[32:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. He didn't believe only in
[32:47] profession.
[32:48] &gt;&gt; No,
[32:49] &gt;&gt; he believed in possession.
[32:51] [Music]
[32:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[32:54] &gt;&gt; Because if you don't possess, you become
[32:56] a
[32:57] &gt;&gt; profess.
[33:01] &gt;&gt; God is in the prophet.
[33:04] &gt;&gt; You see,
[33:05] &gt;&gt; and that is profession.
[33:08] When Elisha was following Elijah to
[33:11] Jordan,
[33:12] &gt;&gt; it was still a prophet.
[33:16] But when they were over Jordan
[33:18] [Music]
[33:26] that the thing was in
[33:30] &gt;&gt; that show that the thing was in brother
[33:34] &gt;&gt; why the people don't see the seals
[33:37] &gt;&gt; it is because
[33:38] &gt;&gt; they were in a man
[33:41] &gt;&gt; it's also the seven
[33:42] &gt;&gt; se as We we will just for a few minutes
[33:47] &gt;&gt; look at it.
[33:48] &gt;&gt; What happened
[33:51] &gt;&gt; in Genesis?
[33:54] There was no man to kill the ground.
[33:56] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[33:56] &gt;&gt; Uhhuh.
[33:57] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Only man God had was a spirit.
[34:02] &gt;&gt; Adam was a spirit.
[34:04] &gt;&gt; Adam couldn't till the ground.
[34:06] &gt;&gt; No. No.
[34:07] &gt;&gt; Now till the ground doesn't mean Adam
[34:10] with a fork was the ground.
[34:13] &gt;&gt; No. Amen.
[34:18] [Music]
[34:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[34:23] &gt;&gt; Some people dream of seeing Adam with a
[34:27] pig.
[34:29] Amen.

[34:54] &gt;&gt; only after the fall she was called
[34:57] &gt;&gt; the fall she was called.
[35:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[35:03] The fall is Adam who said you are
[35:08] never
[35:10] God.
[35:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[35:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:18] &gt;&gt; All right. Now,
[35:21] &gt;&gt; God had to bring down the man because
[35:24] you know me and you
[35:26] &gt;&gt; we were our our spirit was not
[35:32] created.
[35:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[35:37] [Music]
[35:39] &gt;&gt; Your spirit was not created.
[35:42] &gt;&gt; Your your spirit
[35:44] God processed it.
[35:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[35:48] &gt;&gt; From being a

[36:11] &gt;&gt; But the spirit was not created.
[36:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:15] &gt;&gt; So now for a man to till the ground,
[36:20] &gt;&gt; God had to someone
[36:24] to to mold.
[36:26] &gt;&gt; Yes. A body
[36:28] &gt;&gt; from the ground. a body.
[36:30] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[36:31] &gt;&gt; For to tilt the ground.
[36:34] &gt;&gt; And he had to summon the spirit man into
[36:36] that body.
[36:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[36:39] &gt;&gt; In order to give it a nature.
[36:42] &gt;&gt; He was called a living soul.
[36:46] [Music]
[36:48] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[36:50] Let's do it like this
[36:53] &gt;&gt; a bit and
[36:55] fear not going to belong here.
[37:00] Unless you
[37:02] [Music]
[37:05] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Here we are. We
[37:07] are coming here.
[37:08] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[37:08] &gt;&gt; I'll come back to this for a for a for a
[37:11] while.
[37:13] Okay.
[37:15] Here we have six days.
[37:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[37:19] &gt;&gt; You know, we've seen this before. One,
[37:21] two, three, four, five, six. Next time
[37:26] we'll I give to the brothers so to deem
[37:28] it there.
[37:30] &gt;&gt; H
[37:31] six days
[37:34] of creation.
[37:36] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[37:37] &gt;&gt; Six.
[37:38] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Now the Bible says uh these things
[37:41] were like seals
[37:45] &gt;&gt; because God said let there be and
[37:48] brother Brenam says
[37:50] &gt;&gt; and there was no light to be seen until
[37:53] that way it was manifested
[37:57] &gt;&gt; so he says it started with a saying
[38:02] &gt;&gt; let there be
[38:04] &gt;&gt; and the one says no no no brother the
[38:07] Bible says Let there be light. And there
[38:09] was light.
[38:10] &gt;&gt; Yes, there was light in God. There was
[38:14] light
[38:15] &gt;&gt; and but the light the material
[38:18] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[38:19] &gt;&gt; appeared
[38:21] the thing was the way was materialized.
[38:25] &gt;&gt; When the way was manifested
[38:30] &gt;&gt; that is God's system.
[38:32] &gt;&gt; Let there be the bride.
[38:33] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[38:34] And there was no right to be seen.
[38:43] &gt;&gt; So it is seen only when it is
[38:45] manifested.
[38:48] &gt;&gt; Now there was no man to till the ground.
[38:51] &gt;&gt; On the seventh day, the Bible says God
[38:54] rested.
[38:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[38:57] &gt;&gt; He did nothing.
[39:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:00] &gt;&gt; On the seventh day. Hey.
[39:03] &gt;&gt; And God God was looking for a man.
[39:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[39:09] &gt;&gt; Yes, Lord.
[39:10] &gt;&gt; Because men is an amate god.
[39:12] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[39:14] &gt;&gt; Or a a a a
[39:18] little god under God.
[39:21] &gt;&gt; God, the God of nature.
[39:23] &gt;&gt; So because God said, "Let us make man in
[39:25] our image." So that means he made
[39:28] another god.
[39:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[39:31] That's
[39:31] &gt;&gt; why brother Brenam says the thing you
[39:33] have lost is your
[39:39] &gt;&gt; I was just recently
[39:41] saying that preaching in it I don't
[39:45] remember but like that what you need
[39:49] &gt;&gt; what we are looking for
[39:51] &gt;&gt; is not to be a great man
[39:54] &gt;&gt; or to be a better pastor
[39:57] &gt;&gt; or to know better than on board
[40:00] &gt;&gt; or to win a big church.
[40:03] &gt;&gt; No.
[40:03] &gt;&gt; Or to belong to that.
[40:06] &gt;&gt; What you need is your gosh.
[40:12] &gt;&gt; You have lost something.
[40:15] [Music]
[40:17] &gt;&gt; You have lost
[40:20] what you need.
[40:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:22] &gt;&gt; Each one of us knows where he was.
[40:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:28] where he is from.
[40:30] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[40:31] &gt;&gt; So now that is what you need.
[40:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:35] &gt;&gt; You have your other self.
[40:38] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[40:38] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[40:41] &gt;&gt; All right.
[40:42] &gt;&gt; Sure.
[40:42] &gt;&gt; So God had to summon men from the
[40:47] spirit.
[40:48] The spirit.
[40:51] &gt;&gt; I can't write from this side. My hand is
[40:55] now here. Here on earth, it's a man.
[41:00] &gt;&gt; That man is just a
[41:01] &gt;&gt; statue.
[41:05] &gt;&gt; Lifeless.
[41:06] &gt;&gt; Now, God has to bring down
[41:09] &gt;&gt; the spirit down to him.
[41:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[41:13] &gt;&gt; In order to be able
[41:16] &gt;&gt; to till the ground
[41:19] &gt;&gt; to do his work.
[41:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[41:20] &gt;&gt; In the garden which was placed eastward.
[41:24] Hey
[41:24] &gt;&gt; and the man was placed there.
[41:27] &gt;&gt; And so now he held the that position.
[41:32] &gt;&gt; As we see the cherabs were just
[41:35] substitutes
[41:37] there substitute
[41:39] for standing for the men to come.
[41:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[41:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[42:05] Hallelujah.
[42:07] [Music]
[42:08] &gt;&gt; Then he says later when it was revealed

[43:50] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[43:51] &gt;&gt; He didn't say God will give
[43:55] you.
[43:58] Hallelujah.
[43:59] Because it says she fell
[44:02] &gt;&gt; in the channel.
[44:07] &gt;&gt; Now when she was in the channel that was
[44:10] the third

[44:29] &gt;&gt; Ask me not to give some testimonies
[44:35] &gt;&gt; because I'll have to to to stop this and
[44:38] start giving testimonies.
[44:41] &gt;&gt; How a word was just said that do that.
[44:47] &gt;&gt; Now you've seen this. It is the type of
[44:49] Christ and the bride.
[44:53] &gt;&gt; Now sister
[44:56] um
[44:57] Now the set works like this. Sister, she
[45:00] never said, "All right, brother, since
[45:04] you recognize that I'm poor,
[45:08] &gt;&gt; how about 5 million?"
[45:15] &gt;&gt; So to her under the third pool,
[45:20] &gt;&gt; uh it was salvation which is something
[45:23] that will be there forever.
[45:30] That's the third
[45:33] &gt;&gt; one as for Mercedes B and a caravan
[45:39] fishing rod.
[45:43] &gt;&gt; Okay. Now Elijah. Now you must read
[45:47] Elijah
[45:50] &gt;&gt; on the other side not this side where
[45:53] the church is big.
[45:56] But on the other side,
[45:59] &gt;&gt; Elishah said to Elijah, Elijah said to
[46:03] Elisha, "What would you uh want me to do
[46:07] for you?"
[46:09] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[46:10] &gt;&gt; You go read them.
[46:12] &gt;&gt; He didn't He didn't say God.
[46:15] &gt;&gt; He said, "What do you want me to do for
[46:18] you
[46:22] &gt;&gt; before I'm taken away?
[46:25] And the Bible says Elishah said, "I want
[46:28] your
[46:39] &gt;&gt; He said he never said I want God.
[46:43] I want yours.
[46:44] [Music]
[46:45] [Applause]
[46:50] &gt;&gt; Then after that,
[46:52] &gt;&gt; because Elijah said, "If you can see me
[46:56] living,
[46:58] &gt;&gt; this will happen to you."
[46:59] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[47:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:02] &gt;&gt; Now when he ascended,
[47:06] was it in a chariot? What?
[47:09] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[47:10] So the
[47:13] &gt;&gt; dropped
[47:14] [Music]
[47:17] &gt;&gt; he dropped the
[47:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:23] &gt;&gt; Then he said he came back and said where
[47:26] is the God of the life?
[47:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:31] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[47:32] &gt;&gt; Brother, it's not only the spoken word.
[47:36] &gt;&gt; It should be God.
[47:40] Thank you.
[47:46] [Music]
