The pastor said to me, "Call me tomorrow at 9:00. I will go in there with you." [Applause] [Music] And then I got to 9:00 and then I called.

I was on number eight. I then check again with Qua and Qua said the same thing that the pastor is still resting and then when I was getting closer and then I switch off the phone thinking that he's going to disturb me and then when there was three people in front of me I then switch on the phone then I found call WhatsApp and then before then he said to me send a voice note and your your photo I will send them to the pastor and then in my heart I thought that's what not the pastor said then I did not send I found I called and he answered He said, "The pastor is awake now waiting for you." And then I moved to the side and the queue was moving. There was three people in front of me. Then I said to the pastor, "Pastor, there's three people. I'm just speaking Lord because I was closed now." And then the me send me your photo in send your photo so I could pray. And then the pastor prayed. He then said to me, "Go in. I will go with [Music] [Applause] you." I went in, I came back feeling great. I went in for an interview. I was so confident because I was working with the pastor. All the questions that they've asked me, it was not me answering, but it was the pastor responding to those questions.

You must learn to read the book that [Music] is the only one who could do it and he took it from the right hand of him that sat upon the throne the book now to claim his redemptive redempt thief to claim his rights. Amen. Amen. Not from maloney within himself. God didn't save you from maloney. You were right in him. Is that right? Now when he takes the book, he take takes the book from within himself. Somebody has heard it. Then then he took it from the right hand him that sat upon the throne. The Bible says the lamb. Who was on the throne? throning or you don't know. Oh, let's see. Read it for for our brethren. Amen. Revelation chapter fine. I want to know whether you have that book in you. It says he came and took the the the book from within. The one that sat on the throne. Now the one who said it was not talking about king or we haven't yet started. And he took it from the right hand of him that sat upon the not from a bookshop. Amen. Right. Amen. If I let me put this so that you are not confused. I go to the bookshop to buy a book. I know which book. I know all about I know all about that book. You get what I mean? Amen. When I leave my home for for that book, I go there with that book in me. But I I I go for that book in letter form because the Bible should be in you. The seven seals should be in you. If it is not in you, you don't have it. [Music] The book was with the one who sat on the throne. But not in his hand like this but in him. Okay. Amen. Now we are just laying a foundation. We are still going to see something. Now he took the book within himself and he took it from the right hand sat on the throne. Amen. Amen. Every day when you read if you are a predestinated seat you take the book from within. Amen. Amen. Now to claim his redemptive to claim his rights to claim. I'm glad to claim his rights. It is his rights to claim for me and you. If it it is so with you, you'll say amen. to claim for me that what he redeemed as from two. That means he has redeemed you from two. Exactly. Amen. Okay.

Now with the book uh in his hands, we are ready to ask grace mercy to open the seven book. Let us look and let us look past the curtain of as I say. I was listening to a young man last night when he he was sort of disturbed. We were sort of disturbed like this like you are a son of God. And if should somebody say brother harvest is a child of God. Somebody is disturbed just like the brother in Australia disturbed some people. Amen. He disturbed brother dist. We are coming to our title. The Jews were disturbed and said, "You are a man." Those were Jews. They were stepped. He's a man, but he thinks he's God. Now, let me tell you something. If you say to a man, you are a man, but you make yourself God, that means he has seen God in you. Amen. But because he doesn't believe God, he he he is disturbed. If God appears in you or if somebody gives a testimony, about the God who is in you. Then they said to the Lord Jesus, "You are a man, but you make yourself God." Amen. Amen. Apostles and them they were killed. Why? Because they said they were disturbed by the fact that they said they make this man God and yet he's a man. Are they not saying the same [Music] thing? Amen. Otherwise I'm leading you to something. They said you are a man but you just make yourself a god. They even killed those who would say he is Messiah. He is God. They were killed for that. He is a man. All right. Amen. Brother, you are a man, but you are a child of God. Amen. The Lord Jesus came as a man. What disturbed them was that the form was of a man. Now the people who cannot see spiritual things, they cannot see spiritual people. Amen. Did you hear this? Amen. They if they can't see what is in a man, they start to say, "Who you think you are? You are a man. as I was listening to this young man. Okay, for last minutes for we we are coming to to arrive at the end of the whole thing. Now he says, "Let us look at the kitten of time." Amen. Amen. If you look at a man with the eyes of a man, you will say, "You are a man, but you make yourself go." That's what how they said to Jesus. Amen. God is not worshiped by such people. I'll tell you as we will read the Lord Jesus actually his real real form which the people cannot see is inside. Did you hear the letter the book we read? This is not from from the bookshop. Mhm. Amen. God when he looks at you. He looks at the form which is the your form form. Tell me about your real form. Christ. Christ. Amen. Yes. Amen. Inside you are like him. Otherwise, you won't believe him. If your inside is not him, you won't believe him. That's why the people do not believe us. Because they are not like us inside. Amen. They know that God is holy. Now that's why if you hear them saying to the Lord Jesus Christ you are a man but because the form is of a man now they are looking at the form but they don't look at you can't see God by That's why I'm closing it. Let us look up the curtain of because if you look at Jesus, you are looking at a man. But if you are looking at the Christ, Amen. What does the word Christ mean? Anointed. Anointed one. Now there's two things about men. You can look at a man the form of a man. You are a man but you make yourself God. But if you you can look inside because uh God make things like this. You as a Christian, you don't look like a a mere man. You don't see like God has sent a prophet and one says they are worshiping a man. It was the same thing in the time of because the others were inside us. [Music] You know, I had a book here. I don't know whether it's still around here. If no, if it is not here anyhow, I'm just lying a carpet. We still coming to talk. Brother, get this out for me, please. Okay, let me see. Uh yes. Uh saints, I I I I'm closing uh his ve. This is the unveiling of God. When he is veiled, the people say to him, "You are a man." But you are trying to make yourself God because he is veiled to them. But to us he is. We can see inside he unveiled to us. Amen. God is like that. He's veiled to somebody and unveiled to somebody. But if he is unveiled to you, he is God. He is Christ. He is Messiah. He is unveiled to you. But to the other one, they said, "You are a man. They ended up crucifying him thinking that they were dealing with a man. On the third day, the man they thought they destroyed was working with the disciple. Amen. Amen. The very same one they now how do you know that somebody's not a Christian? That's when he will say to you, you are a man. You can realize this man can't see anything. Okay. Amen. But that one says thou art the Christ. And this one says, "You are a man. Are you are you here?" To this one, he is Christ. To this one, he's just a man. Do you see the difference? We are still coming to read things here. Now I look here. He he could change himself and to his to his he would appear but they could they could see inside of him. Let me close in this way. As I'm telling you that I saw a man, a young man, he looks so angry because I have said something and to him he thought I'm trying to make myself go. Mhm. All right. Amen. If you are a child of God, let talk about a lamp. Lamp is a child of a sheep. That's right. So now and the nature if you don't like uh sheep. Amen. [Applause] The people who don't love God, they don't love you. Amen. Why? Because your nature is divine. Amen. Now it's two different nature. This one with another nature will hate you because his nature is not the same as you. [Music] Amen. That's why if your nature is that of God, the person who hates you is the one with the nature of Satan. They hated the Lord Jesus. Their nature of the devil. Amen. So they would say things about him. He's a man but but he just make himself God because they are outside. Now those that that are in they know Jesus Christ from the inside. All right. Amen. A lion cannot worship with a lamb. This one is a lion. You get what I mean? Amen. Now brothers, let me say this. He said, "But we are coming to something wonderful, something that will make you so happy as a child of God. If you hate your brother just because he's a Christian, you are robbed." Amen. uh from way back there were those who wanted to uh throw their brother into a a dish. Was it a well or what? What was it in a ditch? Why they hated you? Yeah, they hated him now because the nature in their was of the God they hated. Amen. In closing, I'm just [Music] because they hated him. He say he says even you, they will hate you. Now somebody can bow down and say God, I pray for for this brother. I don't love you, don't like him. You think God is like you? No. But the people can say, "Lord God, I I don't like this brother. Yeah, I pray that you deal with him." thinking that God is like him. Okay. Some other prayers say you must look at them. They are dangerous. Yeah. They are not godly. [Music] Lord God, when I just look at him I'm just bored. You think God will be listening at such a prayer. God has got no jokes. [Music] Now I'm I I'm preparing this. Hello. Uh now you must I always read for the people who hates God's prophet. [Music] When brother Brennham speaks about a prophet, he says a prophet. So, so it was God. A prophet was God in a man. Now watch your nature. A Christian is God formed in a man. Now you hate a Christian because you you hate God. [Music] Then a brother says to you, you know, me and you, we were together before the foundation of the world and it it hurts somebody because that somebody is God. Now if you are you appear before him and your nature inside is of God, every person who hates God hates you because the nature of God. Did you see? So a prophet It was God formed in a man called a prophet. Amen. Right. Amen. Now your nature if it is not of God surely you'll hate this because the nature you have the nature of God. Amen. So you won't hate your brother. You can manage to hate if the nature in you is not of God. Okay. Amen. I was talking with a brother about somebody You know, you know, some people they can just say I I don't I don't mean something that doesn't even exist. But he can say, you are a witch. And if you can say to a person that you're a witch, even though he's a witch, [Music] He just said I'm a witch. But if you can call them a sight, but are you not really a witch? It's people who made me to be a witch. I don't like this thing, but people made me to be Then you end up by saying, "Yeah, you are a witch." I'm telling you, it's the people who made me to be. The other day we were listening about witches. They said one comes to the pool. Today I'm not talking about that. I'm just passing. You see our pool where we baptize the others are really taking [Music] chances. They counted another one who has a shop and they also counted another one. those who wants to do whatever but like a child of God those things they don't bother me and I can't even go and try and question that person those that are in God they are not afraid of Satan Amen Where's that child?

Why? We are Christians. We are Christians. They are there. Amen. All right. Amen. from back there when it seemed my leg was troubling me. They were telling me even mentioning by names is that one and that one. Did I go there to bother them? Now I want you to listen, saints. As I'm closing, we don't go around telling people that they are witches. It is God saying they are witches. Amen. You know, Amen. But after after hearing that, we don't go to them. Amen. The Lord said, "We will even handle the harmful things. They won't harm us. Just watch me." I was in [Music] another mother.

No. The Lord Jesus said to they will be there and you will defeat them. Amen. Being there they are there. Amen. Where everywhere you go to church they are there. Amen. But Christ didn't say you must run away. I shall give you power. He said, "Amen. You shall overcome them." They must be there to prove. Amen. Even the other day they were telling us about them. Amen. Saying where starting from here in church. Amen. But should we leave the church and run away? Is the church out? No. Say we ran away from the witches. A witch, even a witch is trying to practice their own things. Those that started elders know we fought with them from way back. That's why the other one was preaching underach. When they say we preach underworld, that's when we are talking about Satan. Now the witches, they say quiet. All right. Amen. He said we shouldn't be afraid of them. Amen. Let me not start to talk about which is and they can even hear me when I'm talking. Amen. One can say be careful this people they will really harm you. A witch is just a witch. Amen. Amen. even though they were telling me about my leg. There is others who were trying to take off my leg, but I won't report them. Jesus didn't tell me those that which bewitch you must. He said you'll overcome them. All right. Don't report the witch, but you must pray for them. There's no way you won't find a witch. Even them, they are practicing their own things. A witch.
