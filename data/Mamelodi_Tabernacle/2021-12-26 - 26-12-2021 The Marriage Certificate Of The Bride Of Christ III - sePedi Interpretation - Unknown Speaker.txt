[Music] [Music] [Laughter] [Music] then we can say also [Music] [Music] as i greet you all in the name of our lord jesus christ [Music] [Music] i i've got this part here that says that is christ is the mystery of god revealed historically moreover christ i just love to read it before the proceedings his church is himself what we call the bride today is actually himself revealed now we just want to attend his wedding his wedding [Music] you will never find her in political problems with some other women she's just a quiet woman before one side while never involved in the differences i cannot say anybody different thing because she is married now we want to look at that bride of christ [Music] but this married one will always tell the people about somebody she has had from the husband she's not involved in church differences no should she get she should she get involved your husband you say yeah yeah you are my wife says she will say nothing until she unless she hears from her husband [Music] he says we are amateur gods now with me if brother branham says that this then that means god say said it [Applause] and the brother said to me i hear that the statement you have made is all over zimbabwe and over that other side that brandon kodima says we are a mature god i said don't involve yourself in the foreign [Music] behold i will send you elijah the prophet then listen to that prophet amen don't get involved in the rumors it was required [Music] my youtube the people are using youtube to scandalize and tell lies and all that just all right [Music] behold i will send you elijah the prophet just think that so that we can start here amen amen are you openly [Music] [Music] [Music] christ is the mystery christian catholic jesus christ it doesn't says jesus is the mystery fire it says christ is the mystery of god revealed now let's hear here i asked the brother just to i think that for me it's very short perhaps you may remain seated [Music] okay take it in the days [Music] let me [Music] is [Music] [Music] [Applause] and [Music] [Applause] is [Music] to their children is [Music] ah man we may stand up for the reading of the word the song was composed by our brother in zimbabwe and there is a brother also in swaziland another brother [Music] that's why our ministry [Music] let's say the ministry that god has given to us for every knee in heaven government the cafe apart from that thank you for watching we have the air force and then we have down here the [Music] so the battle is fought in three [Music] places and the ministry is in free irania everything is the same scripture we have read [Music] and i saw a great white throne in him that sat on it from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away and there was found no place for them and i saw the dead small and great stand before god and the books were opened and another book was opened which is the book of life and the dead were judged out of those things which were written in the books according to their works and the sea gave up the dead which were in it and death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them and they were judged every man according to their works and death and hell were cast into the lake of fire this is the second death and whosoever was not found written in the book of life was cast into the lake of fire some [Music] [Music] foreign and ask the man of god just to say a word of loving and prayer father once again we come before thee knowing lord god you are worthy yeah and the lord god that we can stand before thy sense amen lord god it is because you are amidst us father god we now come unto thee to say father now reveal the word we want to hear what has been written in between the lines yes we have read the word with the knowledge from school yeah but now we don't require school anymore amen we want the almighty now to come before us and take preeminence yes the loving father we want to come out of this place not the same way that we arrived our lord jesus christ we want to go out of this place at different people a people that can save the beta a people that will have been equipped the people that have known the positions that were supposed to take in the borders that is the bride and loving father we want you to come down now and lord we would love if you would open our spiritual ears that we can hear and the lord god we may say always well because you were misters yes glory honor and majesty be unto thee even as i dedicate my pastor into your hands yes the lord god you may be the one to use him in a mighty way that loving father the trip that he has come to marawi may be a trip that we shall remember that the lord indeed visited us in jesus name we pray amen amen you may be seated god bless you [Music] to be here in malawi by god's grace okay okay you you know to worship god behind the enemy lines the devil didn't want us to come here for this service satanism [Music] and the enemy garrisoned before them just because behind them was the will of jacob [Music] [Music] [Music] for foreign branham says uh what was in the heart of david was a commander to these three men [Music] [Music] [Music] amen so now uh let us look at this and i i'm watching um let me stop here but let us look at this i i want i have invited brother branham to speak for himself so that you you we were looking at two books even last night yesterday book of life and i believe brother branham has shown that if you come to the judgment the white throne judgment is how brother branham says uh there's this left on the left side is goals now i will start reading from this to know our position in the message sent by god because if you don't know your position you will be taken by [Music] so now each and every one of us should recognize his god's given position if god do not ordain you a pastor don't try to ordain yourself a pastor [Music] now let's read [Music] all right you know the bible speaks of the marriage of the lamb amen i'm trying to find this way in the book [Music] for the bible says and the books were open now this is the opening of the books firstly the unveiling of god more unveiling of god this message was actually an invitation for the people to come and attend the unveiling of god whatever uh [Music] of that that which was he assailed he said as he puts it up like this what that was [Music] amen amen i will not say take it or leave [Music] that's right so it's not a thing that came after the assistant camera that which was from the beginning you you will hear because you have heard how which was from the beginning which we have heard which we have seen with our eyes that's right [Music] god has come to continue would you move what that would shall happen if you were there this is the [Music] you are not going to start how to talk that's why jesus says jesus is the beginning of christ so go back to the beginning reconnected recall [Music] [Music] god [Music] a believer here it's not a new member it's not know how he has come to reconnect oh connector [Music] his weight is for for us to wind back [Music] that's why the bible they ask him [Music] [Music] god in order to serve god and the lord jesus said for you worry to serve and believe the bible says in a book of john 1. there was a man sent [Music] [Music] way is [Music] [Music] who he never said i come from this league is recognized himself as a scripture our kiana [Music] [Music] is [Music] to those who were sinned available he said i am the voice [Music] [Music] in the way of the lord god bless you god bless you now let's look at this now now the bride of christ is not some pieces of churches or pieces of [Music] formation while the the real church of god which is now the [Music] okay when he is revealed the bride is revealed amen where is my book hey guys a book here we we need to read the spoken word amen my brother my book is right here okay um i thought that i had somebody here from south africa to help me when things go this way m the bible says seek a nation find division [Music] okay let me pick up the books here brothers and sisters sorry um forgive me for this the invisible union of the bride and we are invisible is [Music] you are the real revelation of this message is to show you who you are what makes us to be so interested in this message it is because it is exactly telling you who you are [Music] he said to the prophet before you have born you were born amen worry in jesus christ lord jesus christ we were chosen before the foundation of the world when he when the garden of eden uh [Music] will close they're not willing i want to read this the other day we were looking at the standing in the gap here we want to attend a marriage here there's a wedding here not actually we are not attending it is our own wedding amendment what do you call that period of 1000 years somebody says let us now hear the prophet or to preach to us the word that created that made us that's why you can only say amen to the way to the word which you yourself are a part of it with amen unless you are [Music] the way the word yeah now let us take it here and you know we look at the standing in the gap standing in the gap and we mentioned something that is for the re-entry [Music] this message has come specially for us to be taken back again [Music] now before i enter this i i say we there was a gab caused by adam adams to do what whatever i mean read it brother read it it will help you if i children saying i want to read this and they do what [Music] is he never said give me a chance to think about it i am the voice that is the word of god killing me hidden characters and a flaming sword which changed every way to keep the way of the tree of life amen amen to keep the way of the tree of life that's right genesis 3 24 [Music] [Music] of the tree of life now if you see men with thought you know that behind that man there's a secret amen amen now to keep the way of the tree of life all right we are on the way there now world foreign [Music] [Music] leading back to [Music] okay foreign he opened up uh even the [Music] uh this man um they were waiting for them coming son from god would speak would you mean and if somebody maybe would say lord i don't understand [Music] he gives the message to adam adam amen he himself has never uttered a word but he has [Music] the lamp opened the seals and [Music] [Music] is it that no one is not me and there was nothing visible because that's when he spoke amen [Music] they [Music] and there was no light until that weight was manifested let there be light that's when he is speaking the light appeared when then the weight was manifested creature situated saying there's a beast beware of that beast there's a beast then the next thing is prayer line i don't know the people like it praying [Music] [Music] is [Applause] [Music] god would say things and wait for the man god created things and stopped and said and the word then says there was no man there is [Music] [Music] i will send you elijah the prophet for you to serve for me to speak through that elijah amen that that that's why how it is god will do nothing but he will speak through his prophetic amen that's why the seven seals came from [Music] there genesis was the seventh seal amen yeah just come in and get it here we [Music] one has had it the problem with the jews they kept on looking up and jesus said jesus now today that's why brother brandon says he has condescended [Music] they are looking up like this [Music] he [Music] trying to bring them to where god is is oh [Music] [Music] you know the pattern yeah right let me read this one he the lamb the bible says there was no one to open but already he has sent given the message to the bride he took the book opened the book of the seal and sent it down to the earth 27th angel have you heard that you are still on that side or on this side foreign there are people that are remaining on the hearing side but not on the side of the manifestation i can prove it to you brother he says god will deliver them out of egypt but on how he is [Music] angel [Music] to reveal it to his people what [Music] this is the site that no one will know about the bride of christ the people can attend the marriage they attended a wedding but it is the bright and the bright group to go further we spoke you remember the message from the insiders [Music] all the news that came from from that is uh no no no no no from diana's side now this is the news from the insiders [Music] [Music] [Music] then it will never come through another channel that means you have missed it one hour because it will only come through this channel if god speaks you don't understand who sufficiently find the channel channel then no he just created and kept silence so you were supposed to run to adam washington [Music] [Applause] god said nothing it is there you will find it there before you pray not like this he sent it down fast oh my god i'm so glad okay so i'll be looking for this the warm heart of africa and god also loved africa he sent his prophet [Music] and from that time he arrived in africa he is still in africa [Music] all right [Music] i took the picture of the prophet from his heart did you hear brother brandon speaking africa was his heart africa amen amen that's why all the way from genesis from the very beginning in genesis from genesis you won't find it here go back to genesis god and men were ones [Music] if you can see it there hold on one you'll see it here don't worry i'm i'm just reading this thing but to leave it where we can pick it up again next time there's this chain of the chain of uh eternity now this great chain of perfection was broken [Applause] what happened when the seals were opened where is the brother i'm sorry sorry sorry my brother i know you are you are a busy man you can't swallow before yes we all know that he took from the one that said on the throne but here it says he took within himself [Music] said i was told that is the father uh [Music] [Music] i don't believe in a god who would bring things halfway to me i saw it coming then i don't know where where it went from god where [Music] amen if you want it come to brother branham amen god has brought it to us quickly [Music] that's how god can come closer to man instead of shouting to heaven never mind okay amen the god who is with us we worship the god who is of redemption now brothers [Music] amen amen which man this man that is the threat before i stop here [Music] i'll be telling you what what did god do he sent peter peter connect cornelius connector let me repeat to you brother when that man was coming from jerusalem on a chariot choice [Music] [Music] angel
