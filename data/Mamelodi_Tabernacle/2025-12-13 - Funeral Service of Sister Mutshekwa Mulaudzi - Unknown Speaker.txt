We are really blessed. We cannot do a lot of work being alone. We can say we really appreciate your support. The family of We &gt;&gt; we we say thank you. &gt;&gt; You are doing the right thing because the Bible says to go to the uh family which is grief is better than to go to the family which is rejoicing. They are doing a right thing by saying comfort the person which you know him better. We we are saying to the family what you have done uh to help one another. That is what you supposed to do as a family while you are still living. We can we are saying to all of you &gt;&gt; this uh old lady which we are gathered to be here because of her. We are the eyewitness that she have been sick for long time. As a family, they didn't fold up their arms. They have done whatever they can in order to save the life of her mother. Our mother she have passed on while she was there in the hospital at Messina's hospital. But we have done everything we can so that she can leave. You as a witness just believe that it is through our mother she have passed on. We don't want to hear a myth when you said we have seen uh our mother uh doing some woodwork or something uh on the bushes. You are a eyewitness that we have buried our mother. We can say to the children &gt;&gt; a departure of our mother. &gt;&gt; The family is still around. Make sure that we give them the news. Let's not just take rational decisions alone. Tomorrow those decisions will hurt us if we don't contact the family. The tiba family, &gt;&gt; the family still around you. The the the the grandchildren they are still here. Come and visit as you used to do when you used to visit your All these families go to the &gt;&gt; and give a support. We know that the departure of our mother doesn't separate us as a family. It must unite us. When we are saying the elders from the church, we don't want to disturb them. When we leave here, we are going to the graveyard. This is a royal family. Uh normally the way we bury our people sometimes it might surprise you the way we do our traditional or our norms. If you feel free, just go there. But if you are not free, don't just go there. We have as family accepted that it is through our mother. She have left. She have left or she have passed on. I have a song that I want to sing. Can you support me? I normally sing this song. Oh [singing] river manu. [singing] [singing] Hallelujah. Thanks for the words of wisdom. Thomas Sag. Thomas is a representative from the family. How can a new [singing] is [singing] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. I'm here representing Thomas which is my older brother. Today he is not here. He he had some commitment. He called me and said I must take the his part. I accepted that uh command from my brother. We are really deeply saddened by the departure of our elder mother. To me, she she was not like a granny. She was like my mother because I know a lot about the mother. Uh from my youth up until today, I've learned from the old mother. I really thank God because he left me while I know how to do things for my own. I saw my grandmother for quite a long long time while she was sick. Even on her last days I was here, I'm I'm the one who took her to the hospital last of last week Friday. I remember last of last week on Friday while I was talking to her through a phone, first thing she asked that did you come back? uh she asked me a question and then I said to her I didn't come back and then she said when are you going to come back and then I answered that I will wait for the closure at work so that I can come back home she asked that can you fetch for me a a pig and a goat Um, I really want to eat the meat of that uh while I'm seated with you at hospital. &gt;&gt; Things turn around after I hear about the call about my uncle uh the departure of our mother. We accepted that it is the God's love. &gt;&gt; As for my for me, I really feel that it was a blessing from God to really heal is a truly healing of our mother. As a grandchildren, we will be united. We will always put our differences aside. As a people, we need to fetch forward uh together as a grandchildren. I really thank you. Amen. [applause] Rich.

We we we came here and then we grew up with her at she taught us a lot of things like plowing She also taught us about going to fetch the wood. She taught us a lot of things also including the love of people. I remember uh &gt;&gt; okay I remembered while I was uh being married she was very upset she asked me a question where are you going my my daughter &gt;&gt; and then I told I told her that I'm going to to be married She said, "You cannot go there." &gt;&gt; I said, "Mother, can you allow me to go for to be married?" &gt;&gt; She said, "Listen to me. If somebody uh have hurt you, don't ever come back. Just tell me what hurt you so that I can give you some advice. &gt;&gt; You don't go there alone. &gt;&gt; I went there with Damboo. When we arrived there, there was they were really comforting us. All these children when they returned back home, I really bitterly cried. I remember the words of the of our mother that she didn't want us to go there. One thing which my mother have told me is that if a man comes back at night, You need to make sure that there's a warm water and then there's a food for your husband. After that, you go and sleep peacefully. If your husband looking for for the porridge, you must tell her that tell him that I have already cooked. It's just that he's now called &gt;&gt; that your husband cannot come to my house and tell me that you didn't cook for him. &gt;&gt; Uh my children's mother, &gt;&gt; our mother have departed. &gt;&gt; Let's agree. I can spend a lot of time. &gt;&gt; We didn't know by the name her by the name of Mua. &gt;&gt; We knew our mother by my mother the name English. She really likes those names English or ma my mother. She really feel like let's just accept even if we have lost our mother. Let's agree that it is true. She have taught us a lesson. Whatever she have taught us, we really put into our heart.

We I just want to say we really feel sad by the departure of our mother. I wanted to take it another way of celebrating the life of our mother but I I really can't I'm feeling this is a very sad moment uh for the departure of our mother. [snorts] When I arrived to the family, I really feels really uh wanted to even to change my surname from Ki to Moroi. I really feel very saddened by the departure of our mother. I I've grown up knowing my mother as Ma uh as we used to call her with these few words I really say thank you really &gt;&gt; [singing] &gt;&gt; I [singing] know my [music] [singing] &gt;&gt; I know my I [singing and music] know.

It was supposed to be Uncle Ta on my place on this his place but he said my my young brother just stand up for me on my behalf. Uh I'm just nephew. I'm just a nephew here at Okay. We as a family of we really accepted that have departed. She was really sick as you have yet the testimony. It was she was admitted at the hospital messina hospital. I went there to visit her after hearing that she's not well. What makes me happy when I arrive at hospital she was smiling. I asked a mother and said did you know me? And she said, "Yes, I saw you while you were entering the hospital." We gave her support thinking that she's going to get help from the well. But the our God have took her. We accept that God have done his love. What makes what makes us happy? &gt;&gt; What makes us happy is just that she left us being accepted our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ and she was living for God. It really comforted us as the Bible have indicated that whoever that believeth in the Lord Jesus Christ and being saved and being baptized, it really makes us [snorts] happy because she was in the Lord. When she departed here, she will get eternal life. us that uh we must not just cry without a hope when when she was called by the name English it shows me that the tiba's family were very wise I can imagine if she was educated what is going to happen they were full of love which you cannot able to explain. &gt;&gt; He used to unite us.

[music] Hallelujah. [singing] Hallelujah. [music] [singing] Over to you. I greet you all in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. We have but a very short time but I want to thank you all for being present in the service of our mother. May the Lord richly bless you all. May the Lord bless the royal family. May the Lord bless the family and the neighbors and all the elders and the people from the village. even those that are coming from a far off. May the Lord richly bless you. &gt;&gt; I'm not a pastor. &gt;&gt; He is not a pastor. &gt;&gt; I'm just an elder in the church. A pastor means a shepherd. So just bear with me as I will be reading the scriptures. For those that are able to stand in respect of the weight, I will ask you to stand as we read the book of First Thessalonians starting from verse 13 to verse 18. I will ask just to say a word of prayer as we close our eyes. [clears throat] Amen. Amen. We can pray. to pay a last respect to our mother. [clears throat] for [clears throat] Foreign speech. Foreign speech. Foreign speech. Amen. Amen. Amen. Verse 13 says, "But I will not have you to be ignorant, brethren, concerning them which are asleep that you sorrow not, even as others who have no hope. For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with him. For this we say unto you by the word of the Lord that we which are alive and remain unto the coming of the Lord shall not prevent them which are asleep. For the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of an archangel and with the trump of God. And the dead in Christ shall rise first. Then we which are alive and remain shall be caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air. and so shall we ever be with the Lord. Wherefore comfort one another with these words. Yes. Fore! Foreign! Foreign! Fore! [cough] Foreign! Foreign! Amen. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So I'm here just to comfort the family. [clears throat] You know, every time I read the word of God, I find a love story. &gt;&gt; You know, I always wondered why they called the Lord Jesus Christ the bridegroom. The reason I call it the love story A man when he proposes a woman, &gt;&gt; he gives promises. Say, I promise you that I will build you the best house. In another wedding, I remember the man promised the the wife a seatless So there's a lot of promises when a man proposes a woman. I'll make you the best woman on earth. [clears throat] I'll give you my name. You know all the promises. &gt;&gt; I had another one even promising the woman, I'll buy you a train. You see, a proposal goes with a lot of things inside. The Lord Jesus Christ when he came to the earth He brought a message to propose us. You see the Bible says, "The Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout." So he descended all the way from heaven. And the Bible says with a shout. See that shout was a proposal. it was a message going forth. So when he was giving out the message, there were so many promises. And one of the promises, he says, if you believe my saying, verily, verily, I say unto you, &gt;&gt; you shall not see death. what the proposal everybody was scared of death. But when he descended coming down, uh my brother, if you can just read, uh uh I just want to show you this love story. You know, uh John chapter 8 and verse 51. And and here when he was coming down giving a message out one of the promises that he brought &gt;&gt; in the proposal you shall not see death. &gt;&gt; Can you read it my brother? &gt;&gt; John 8:51 verily verily I say unto you if a man keep my saying he shall not see death. You see where we read it says &gt;&gt; I will not have you to be ignorant. You know in in the language that we use here on the earth when somebody depart the language that people understand it says the person is dead. But when the Lord Jesus Christ came, he says that is an error. When you read Matthew chap 22 verse 292, he said that is an error. That's why he says I don't want you to be ignorant. When Lazarus was sick, He said, "Our friend Lazarus sleepeth." That's right. &gt;&gt; You know, the disciples didn't even understand. &gt;&gt; And they said, "Oh Lord, &gt;&gt; he if he sleepeth, &gt;&gt; he does well, &gt;&gt; he will wake up." So he had to talk to them in a language that they understand. &gt;&gt; And he said unto them, "Lazarus is dead." &gt;&gt; The language they understand. So our mother believed the proposal that came when the Lord descended coming to the earth. when he gave our mother a proposal to say verily verily I say unto you if you believe my saying you shall not see death our mother said amen accepting that proposal you see death if we have to define it the Bible Death is total separation from God. So our mother is not separated from God. He said there are people that die that are separated from God. But the one that believe he's saying will not see death. meaning he is not totally separated. You see a person is a triune being. You are a body which is this terrestrial being. When Job looked at it, he said, "Hey, this one is full of troubles." And it's of few days when the prophet Job looked at this body said, "Ah, this one is full of troubles." So you can't even brag about this body. I heard one of the scientist saying this body is not even worth more than 10 cent. Then inside of this body is a spirit. &gt;&gt; You see when the Lord made a person he said when you read Genesis chapter 2 verse 7 it says and God formed man out of the dust of the earth. So this man is of the dust of the earth. That's why we take him back to the grave. But then he says he breath into his nostrils, the breath of life and a man became a living soul. So you are a triune being. You are a body, &gt;&gt; you are the spirit &gt;&gt; and you are a soul. &gt;&gt; Now when you depart, the Bible says, &gt;&gt; the spirit goes back to God. &gt;&gt; The body goes to the grave. But the soul when it departs, it depends what you believed. If you believed in the word of God, it goes under the altar. It is in the presence of the almighty God. But if you didn't believe his saying, your soul goes to the prison house. And the language that we use is it goes to hell &gt;&gt; and it will be tormented there in flames. But you see the Lord Jesus Christ said we &gt;&gt; because if you believe he's saying &gt;&gt; you shall not see death. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he said I am &gt;&gt; my brother I want you to read that scripture. Matthew 22 verse start with 29 and go to verse 32. Matthews 22 29. Jesus answered and said unto them, Ye do a not knowing the scriptures nor the power of God. Verse 32, &gt;&gt; 30 &gt;&gt; 34. &gt;&gt; I'm sorry. Yes. 30 31 and 32. But as touching the resurrection of the dead, have ye not read that which was spoken unto you by God, saying, I am the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac and the God of Jacob. God is not the God of the dead, but of the living. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You see, let's go back to John chapter 8. &gt;&gt; Because he says, God is not God of the dead. death is total separation from God. &gt;&gt; So when they look at Abraham, Isaac, &gt;&gt; and Jacob, they are not dead. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's why he says God is not God of the dead because they are in the presence of the almighty God. But those that are not in the presence of the almighty God, they are dead. So we must never go and see what they were saying. H starting from verse 51. &gt;&gt; I will read it my brother and you will interpret it. Chapter 8. Verily, verily, I say unto you, if a man keep my saying, he shall never see death. They challenged him. They challenged the Lord Jesus Christ. They said, "Now we know you have a devil." You see, when he was telling proposing and saying you shall not see death. They said this man has a devil. See they were not accepting the proposal. &gt;&gt; They said Abraham is dead. But before that he said unto the same people, God is not the God of the dead. He is the God of the living. You see, he said, "I am &gt;&gt; the God." Read that verse 32 again, my brother. &gt;&gt; Verse 32, &gt;&gt; "I am the God of Abraham and the God of Isaac." &gt;&gt; Just stop there. Is a present tense. &gt;&gt; It doesn't say I was. &gt;&gt; I am &gt;&gt; because they passed away. &gt;&gt; It says I am. &gt;&gt; Yes. Amen. &gt;&gt; Read it, my brother. I am the God of Abraham &gt;&gt; and the God of Isaac &gt;&gt; and the God of Jacob. &gt;&gt; God is not God of the dead but of the living. They challenge him. Now they say now we know you have a devil. Abraham is dead. The prophets are dead. How can you say if a man keep my saying he shall never taste of death? They looked at him. He was a very young man. No 33 years old. When they looked at him, he said, "Art thou greater than our father Abraham? And they reminded him which is dead. And the prophets &gt;&gt; are dead. What makest thou? You know, I'm sure they were even saying undermining him. You know somewhere they even say you are not even 50 years old and you say you have seen our father Abraham and he was giving them a proposal. Hallelujah. Yeah. &gt;&gt; So even when let's go to the book of Genesis. &gt;&gt; You see when when the wife of Jacob passed away I love uh chapter 35 verse 185 18 &gt;&gt; and it came to pass as her soul was in departing. You see now because they understand people won't understand the soul is in departing then in they say for she died just to make people understand but the Bible doesn't say h if you believe the gospel of Jesus Christ you die depart you know you go to it's like a promotion you go to the presence of the almighty God you see here on the earth we are absent from the almighty god so he comes and propose you so that when you depart you come into his presence amen let's go back to the book of Thessalonians. &gt;&gt; You see that shout was the message going forth &gt;&gt; in Matthew 25. They talk about the wise and the foolish visions. You see the message when it goes forth, it goes to the wise. And it goes to the foolish. You see when when you sleep &gt;&gt; because it says the wise and the foolish, &gt;&gt; they slept. Now when the bridegroom came, they woke up. That was the resurrection. Now when when the wise &gt;&gt; woke up because they had the spirit that raised Jesus Christ from the dead, they went with the bridegroom. But these others, they didn't go with the bridegroom. You see, you need to have the spirit that raised Jesus Christ from the dead in you before you depart because it is the same spirit that will raise you up. Now, let's go back to the book of Thessalonians. You see when he was proposing now the first promise that he gave he said you shall never see death &gt;&gt; that was the first promise. Now the second promise was the voice. Now that voice is the resurrection. You see the Bible says blessed are those that come in the first resurrection. says, "After you have departed, you are not dead, and I will raise you up." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, let's go to John chapter 5. Don't worry, I won't be long. I'm just telling you about the proposal of the Lord Jesus Christ. The first thing he said, you shall not see death. John chapter 5. &gt;&gt; Let's read uh verse 25. Let's start with verse 24, my brother. &gt;&gt; Verily, verily I say unto you, he that heareth my word and believe on him that sent me hath everlasting life. You see, Can you finish it, my brother? &gt;&gt; And shall not come into condemnation, but is passed from death unto life. &gt;&gt; What a promise. &gt;&gt; You see the proposal, this proposal thing didn't start uh here. for a man to propose a woman. It's not a thing that started here. The Lord himself when he came here, when he met us, he started with a proposal. If you hear my word, you have everlasting life. What do you say? If you hear my word, you have everlasting life. If you believe You shall not come into condemnation, but you have passed from death unto life. Even the scientists cannot promise you this. You see the scientist this when when they talk about shooting the R going up there. They talkative but you ask them about death the countenance fall &gt;&gt; because they are troubled about death. You go to a medical doctor, you say, "You see, I for you to get healing, I must give you this injection. You ask ask them about death." The countenance fall. You see, they can't promise you anything. One man promised us life. Verse 25, my brother. &gt;&gt; 25. &gt;&gt; Verily, verily, I say unto you, the hour is coming, and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God, and they that hear shall live. You see that was the second promise. You see, he says in his proposal, &gt;&gt; you'll come in the first resurrection, &gt;&gt; if you hear my voice, &gt;&gt; then he says, if you don't believe me, &gt;&gt; come &gt;&gt; let's go. I will show you where to go. Where's Lazarus? &gt;&gt; Where have you buried him? &gt;&gt; Come. Let me show you &gt;&gt; my second promise. &gt;&gt; Lazarus. Lazarus, come forth. &gt;&gt; And Lazarus came forth. demonstrating the promise to say even if you depart I will bring you up you will be blessed because you will come in the second in the first resurrection then he didn't stop there with the promise he went again and said and the trumpet of God shall sound this is the most beautiful heart. You see, if you propose a woman and the woman accept your proposal, you go home, you tell your parents, I'm ready to get married. You promise them a white wedding. That's what the Lord did. He said if you accept my proposal you know after the resurrection you'll meet we will meet again I'll take you to the palace for the marriage supper he he gave us a lot of promises because we have a short time I'm just bringing these three promises If you hear his word, you have everlasting life. You will not come into condemnation. If you depart, he will resurrect you and and he has already prepared a marriage supper. You see, not here in the palace. You see, I've had people reading John 14 verse 1 and 2. When he was leaving, he said, "For those that have heard my word, don't worry that I'm leaving. I'm going to prepare a place for you. I will come again and receive you unto myself and take you into the palace where you have merit supper. and and and he he even went further and says, "I'm going to bring the Enoch to look after. &gt;&gt; I'm going to bring the Jews, the 144,0004,000 to take care of you." Hallelujah. you know, and he said after the marriage supper, &gt;&gt; we are going for a honeymoon. &gt;&gt; We're going to celebrate for 1,000 years in the millennia before I can take you to the new Jerusalem. So, you see, this is a man that has promises, you shall not see death. What your proposal You shall not see condemnation. I'm going to take you to the marriage supper. When you die, I'm going to resurrect you. Don't be ignorant of him. Don't he has all the promises. And he said after the marriage supper, I'm taking you for a honeymoon. How long does your husband take you for a honeymoon? I still owe my wife a honeymoon [laughter] because I could not even afford it. And even if I can afford it, it won't even be more than seven days. You see, but this one honeymoon,000 years after [screaming] the honeymoon, he says, "Now you are going to judge the dead. You see the people that come in the second resurrection, the Bible calls them the dead. It says you are going to judge them. Then after that, I'm taking you into into our house, the new city, Jerusalem. &gt;&gt; The new Jerusalem. &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. [applause] Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. as we stand on our feet. Uh we were given up until 8:00. So with this few words, &gt;&gt; I'm saying to you, &gt;&gt; accept the proposal from the Lord Jesus Christ. Like our mother here, she is blessed. She will come in the first resurrection. She's going to go into the palace for a merry supper. She's going to go into the millennium. She's going to judge some of the people. She will go into the new city. So if you want to meet our mother, if you really and truly loved her, accept the proposal. [laughter] And if you hear his word, our elder indicated that you must be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. To prove that you have heard the proposal of the Lord Jesus Christ, then we baptize you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. You don't need money. You just need to say amen. and be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. God bless you. &gt;&gt; God bless you. &gt;&gt; My brother, just say a word of prayer. Hallelujah. The great I am. in this village. It goes all around the world. It will catch up the real seed of God. Bless this Sometimes the reality from our elder wisdom to bring these words. It takes an effort. also to be submitted to you with your spirit. That spirit that rose Jesus Christ from the dead. Amen. It is the one that is preaching. Amen. Amen. God bless you. I'm going home.
