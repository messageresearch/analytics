[42:36] Father, this is this morning once again
[42:41] we are singing as a church
[42:45] &gt;&gt; Lord but as individuals
[42:49] who see all this was prepared and
[42:52] planned for you
[42:54] &gt;&gt; before there was a beginning in the name
[42:57] of our Lord Jesus Christ
[43:03] because we didn't have an option.
[43:07] &gt;&gt; Lord, there wouldn't be any place that
[43:10] could hold us this morning.
[43:23] Father, we are the making of your hands
[43:26] and your thoughts,
[43:28] Lord. Father God, this is that morning
[43:31] once again
[43:33] Lord that you saw this church that you
[43:37] saw us as individuals. The prophet says
[43:41] the birth of a human being is a very
[43:44] mysterious process that we were carried
[43:48] over the years through the loins of our
[43:51] parents, our fathers.
[43:53] Today we managed to escape from the
[43:56] millions and millions of those Father
[44:00] God today that we can come and worship
[44:03] you.
[44:05] &gt;&gt; We come to you Father God as individuals
[44:10] if you could just increase our faith
[44:14] &gt;&gt; that we can live above what we see on
[44:18] this planet and the earth.
[44:22] Before
[44:24] the foundation of the world, today we
[44:28] are here. When you were an object of
[44:32] worship, we were part of you.
[44:36] We have come here today to worship thee.
[44:41] Give us just a little piece.
[44:46] increase our faith that we can see
[44:49] and not use one another as a standard.
[44:53] But you the cross. Look at us, Father
[44:56] God, through
[45:00] Look at us, Father God, through the
[45:02] bloodi
[45:05] that you came to be with us.
[45:12] We came one and by one coy that we can
[45:18] hear and get a twinkle from the speck of
[45:22] your word. We want to thank you Lord.
[45:26] Father God we thank you for our pastor.
[45:30] Uh we know that moa it's not that what
[45:34] you look at but you look at the man that
[45:37] you created before the beginning of this
[45:40] world.
[45:43] Strengthen him Lord. Make him stronger
[45:45] Lord that he can take his rightful
[45:49] position
[45:50] on the appointed time.
[46:00] That spirit man is the man that you
[46:03] speak with.
[46:04] [Applause]
[46:06] Give us this day our daily bread.
[46:11] The singers, the church
[46:17] will take it back with

[1:14:44] specifically
[1:14:47] &gt;&gt; is from Deon
[1:14:50] &gt;&gt; from Pastor Charlie.
[1:14:53] Let me just request my brother just to
[1:14:55] go through it.
[1:14:58] Dear pastor and tabernacle, we would
[1:15:02] like to sincerely thank you for sending
[1:15:04] Elder Deacon Peter Kosana to minister at
[1:15:07] our outreach program held at Bulga
[1:15:10] Center Debon on the 12th and the 13th of
[1:15:13] July. His preaching was truly a
[1:15:16] blessing, spiritfilled, uplifting and
[1:15:19] his and impactful. We were grateful. We
[1:15:23] were great. We were greatly encouraged
[1:15:25] by the word and deeply appreciate your
[1:15:29] leadership and spiritual covering. Thank
[1:15:32] you for making it possible for us to be
[1:15:35] nourished and strengthened through such
[1:15:37] a powerful ministry.
[1:15:42] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:43] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:15:46] &gt;&gt; Okay. It continues as brother William
[1:15:50] Brenham once said, "God doesn't call the
[1:15:53] trained. He trains the called."
[1:15:56] &gt;&gt; This quote beautifully reflects what we
[1:15:59] experience. A servant of God truly
[1:16:03] called and used mightily in the service
[1:16:06] of the Lord. In line with it, we are
[1:16:09] reminded of the scripture. and I will
[1:16:12] give you and I will give you pastors
[1:16:16] according to mine heart which shall feed
[1:16:19] you with knowledge and understanding.
[1:16:21] That is Jeremiah 3:15.
[1:16:24] May God continue to bless you
[1:16:26] abundantly, guide your ministry and use
[1:16:30] you to rise to raise more vessels for
[1:16:35] his kingdom. Amen.
[1:16:40] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah.
[1:16:43] &gt;&gt; You know, Elders Kosana used to say
[1:16:48] he always thanks the pastor
[1:16:51] &gt;&gt; that he has taught them
[1:16:55] from all these years.
[1:16:58] So when we see such a commence,
[1:17:03] we say thank the Lord
[1:17:06] for the good work that has been done
[1:17:10] through our pastor.
[1:17:13] Amen.
[1:17:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:17:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:17:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.

[1:29:11] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus. It's not about a man. It's
[1:29:15] about you.
[1:29:16] &gt;&gt; Come down, Lord, and be with your people
[1:29:19] as they're waiting upon thee. In Jesus
[1:29:22] Christ name we pray. Amen.
[1:29:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:26] &gt;&gt; So, how many of you pray today that uh
[1:29:30] the Lord should speak to you?
[1:29:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:29:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. I hope we didn't pray that should
[1:29:38] speak to you.
[1:29:44] So if you pray that God should speak to
[1:29:46] you,
[1:29:50] trust your prayer,
[1:29:53] that God is going to answer your prayer
[1:29:56] today.
[1:29:57] [Music]
[1:30:00] Amen.
[1:30:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:01] &gt;&gt; Uh I didn't know that I I was going to
[1:30:04] be here.
[1:30:07] Not at all.
[1:30:09] &gt;&gt; I am here by faith.
[1:30:12] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:30:16] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:30:18] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[1:30:24] I I I was just told
[1:30:28] &gt;&gt; the pastor wants you now.
[1:30:35] So I was in I wasn't at home.
[1:30:42] &gt;&gt; So I drove from Blanta to Lionga to get
[1:30:44] on a plane to come.
[1:30:51] I alive last night
[1:30:56] [Applause]
[1:31:01] &gt;&gt; and I'm leaving in the morning.
[1:31:06] &gt;&gt; Yes, but I'll be back.
[1:31:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:16] &gt;&gt; So, I didn't know that I'll be here.
[1:31:19] I didn't know that I would be preaching
[1:31:20] this year.
[1:31:23] And so this message was the one which
[1:31:27] was for our church in Malawi there.
[1:31:32] So when you hear the message,
[1:31:35] it's applicable to Malawians.
[1:31:41] Hallelujah.
[1:31:42] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah.
[1:31:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:31:44] &gt;&gt; So this is a message for Malawians.
[1:31:49] So if it's applicable to you,
[1:31:51] just know that something is supernatural
[1:31:53] is happening.
[1:31:56] [Music]
[1:31:58] Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:32:00] &gt;&gt; So let's go to
[1:32:06] Oh, okay.
[1:32:12] Hebrews.
[1:32:15] &gt;&gt; I don't know whether to
[1:32:18] It will work today.
[1:32:26] &gt;&gt; Hebrews
[1:32:31] 11.
[1:32:34] &gt;&gt; Unfortunately, at home, we read the
[1:32:36] whole chapter,
[1:32:38] &gt;&gt; but here I don't think we should do
[1:32:40] that.
[1:32:42] &gt;&gt; You know, when when you're at home, you
[1:32:44] can take your time.
[1:32:48] Yeah. So you going to display the first
[1:32:50] the the first
[1:32:53] uh the first uh slide.
[1:32:57] &gt;&gt; Yeah. So Hebrew Hebrews
[1:33:00] the second slide I should say. The
[1:33:02] second slide. Yes. Give me the second
[1:33:03] slide.
[1:33:05] &gt;&gt; Yes. Now faith
[1:33:09] &gt;&gt; is the substance
[1:33:12] &gt;&gt; of things hoped for.
[1:33:16] the evidence
[1:33:19] &gt;&gt; of things
[1:33:22] which are not seen.
[1:33:24] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:33:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:26] &gt;&gt; I want to stop there because at home we
[1:33:28] went up to verse 40. But uh
[1:33:32] let's just say today we are talking
[1:33:34] about faith.
[1:33:37] Amen. Amen.
[1:33:38] &gt;&gt; So you can be seated. We have already
[1:33:40] prayed.
[1:33:43] Please sit comfortably.
[1:33:45] [Music]
[1:33:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:33:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:06] Yeah. So now faith
[1:34:10] &gt;&gt; substantiates
[1:34:18] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:20] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:34:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:22] &gt;&gt; Uh God bless you. I saw brother
[1:34:25] somewhere. We were together last Sunday.
[1:34:32] &gt;&gt; God bless you my brother.
[1:34:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:34:36] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; We met on spiritual grounds in Malawi
[1:34:41] there.
[1:34:45] &gt;&gt; I never knew him. He never knew him. But
[1:34:49] his spirit and my spirit connected and
[1:34:54] we met. A man which I've never known
[1:34:57] before
[1:34:59] just came to be in my office
[1:35:03] against all odds.
[1:35:08] That's what happened. Ask him.
[1:35:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:13] &gt;&gt; Since then, we've been brothers.
[1:35:16] &gt;&gt; So when he came to preach,
[1:35:19] he started preaching as if he's pastor
[1:35:21] said, "Ah, now I know you."
[1:35:26] He was following each and every
[1:35:28] paragraph.
[1:35:30] [Music]
[1:35:32] I said, "My brother God bless you.
[1:35:36] &gt;&gt; Preach again.
[1:35:38] &gt;&gt; Preach again. Preach again. He was
[1:35:40] almost preaching every day.
[1:35:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:35:46] &gt;&gt; But we met. He had come to visit other
[1:35:48] churches there.
[1:35:51] Um they were not lucky enough to ask him
[1:35:53] to preach.
[1:36:01] Amen.
[1:36:02] &gt;&gt; Amen. So faith
[1:36:06] &gt;&gt; substantiates
[1:36:07] things hoped for.
[1:36:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:36:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:36:18] &gt;&gt; So
[1:36:19] a lot of you here
[1:36:22] have had children.
[1:36:24] Some of you have got children.
[1:36:26] Five years old, 6 years old, seven years
[1:36:29] old.
[1:36:30] If you tell your child
[1:36:32] who knows
[1:36:34] your abilities
[1:36:36] unless you are a very poor father. But
[1:36:39] if you are a father, you tell your
[1:36:42] child, "Hey son,
[1:36:45] &gt;&gt; this year I'm going to give give you a
[1:36:49] birthday."
[1:36:52] He goes to school.
[1:36:54] &gt;&gt; He told his friend,
[1:36:57] "This year,
[1:36:59] &gt;&gt; you're going to attend my birthday.
[1:37:02] Because my father says I'll have a
[1:37:04] birthday.
[1:37:07] He's already trading
[1:37:10] something which is not there
[1:37:13] but his faith tells him his birthday is
[1:37:18] on
[1:37:22] he can trade on it.
[1:37:26] If you can say, "Oh, tomorrow I'll give
[1:37:30] you 50 rands."
[1:37:33] &gt;&gt; You can go to a shop at the corner,
[1:37:36] give me sweets. Give me that.
[1:37:39] How are you paying
[1:37:42] tomorrow?
[1:37:46] He has got faith enough
[1:37:50] to believe that you cannot faith.
[1:37:55] Hallelujah.
[1:37:57] &gt;&gt; That is why but the Bible says
[1:38:00] without faith
[1:38:02] we cannot be able to please God
[1:38:07] because God wants us to believe him
[1:38:12] as much as a fiveyear-old
[1:38:14] can believe his father that there's
[1:38:16] going to be a birthday.
[1:38:22] Amen. Amen. So we need to take God on
[1:38:25] his word.
[1:38:30] Hallelujah.
[1:38:32] Romans uh Romans 1:17 says 1:17
[1:38:37] therein
[1:38:39] there's lousiousness
[1:38:43] God revealed from faith to faith
[1:38:50] as it is written
[1:38:52] the just shall live by faith.
[1:38:57] We live by faith.
[1:38:59] &gt;&gt; We don't live by knowledge.
[1:39:03] Let
[1:39:03] &gt;&gt; let alone salaries.
[1:39:08] &gt;&gt; We live by faith,
[1:39:11] tomorrow.
[1:39:12] If there is tomorrow,
[1:39:15] we will move from faith
[1:39:18] to faith.
[1:39:20] We don't become stagnant in faith.
[1:39:26] Amen.
[1:39:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:39:28] &gt;&gt; Um
[1:39:32] faith
[1:39:36] which we should have
[1:39:38] it's that common day faith
[1:39:48] common day faith.
[1:39:52] When God wanted the Israelites
[1:39:56] to apply the token,
[1:39:59] he told them to take hissop
[1:40:04] was a common wheat.
[1:40:07] [Music]
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:40:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:40:11] &gt;&gt; That's slide number five. Brother
[1:40:16] &gt;&gt; is just a common weed
[1:40:21] by his was just common wheats.
[1:40:30] Apply the token
[1:40:33] using his
[1:40:37] faith.
[1:40:39] Somebody tries to make faith
[1:40:41] supernatural.
[1:40:47] That's the reason we miss a lot of
[1:40:49] things.
[1:40:52] Believe God as a five-year-old.
[1:40:58] Faith is just a common thing.
[1:41:02] You go to you got faith to come to
[1:41:05] church.
[1:41:07] You got faith to walk out here.
[1:41:12] You got you you sat your car. You got
[1:41:14] faith.
[1:41:20] You got faith to eat your dinner.
[1:41:25] That's the way it is.
[1:41:28] Just common faith.
[1:41:33] Amen.
[1:41:36] &gt;&gt; Don't try to make your faith as if it's
[1:41:38] something which you graduate from vit.
[1:41:50] It's not like that. When God says
[1:41:54] believe it as it is already done,
[1:42:01] &gt;&gt; it's just common. Amen.
[1:42:04] &gt;&gt; Everyday faith. Amen.
[1:42:11] &gt;&gt; To believe God.
[1:42:14] Amen.
[1:42:19] &gt;&gt; So what is defeating us now?
[1:42:24] Fear.
[1:42:28] Fear is defeating us.
[1:42:34] One of the greatest cases of the church
[1:42:36] today
[1:42:39] is fear.
[1:42:41] Everybody's scared.
[1:42:43] You are scared about the economy.
[1:42:46] Scared about your job security.
[1:42:49] You know what
[1:42:52] you you can read the quotation there
[1:42:53] isn't it?
[1:42:55] &gt;&gt; What does the prophet says?
[1:42:58] &gt;&gt; What's the greatest fa what's the
[1:42:59] greatest case which we have is fear.
[1:43:05] &gt;&gt; The greatest thing that I find against
[1:43:07] the church tonight
[1:43:13] everybody here is g getting mentally
[1:43:16] crazy. You are in you live in fear.
[1:43:24] You are scared. Oh, am I going to get
[1:43:26] married? Or am I going to get a job? Am
[1:43:30] I going to get a house? Am I going to
[1:43:32] get this? What? What are you scared
[1:43:35] about?
[1:43:40] If a man is born again,
[1:43:42] he should be happy and carefree.
[1:43:51] Don't be scared.
[1:43:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:43:54] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:43:55] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:44:02] &gt;&gt; Fear.
[1:44:05] No fear.
[1:44:08] &gt;&gt; The greatest break
[1:44:13] that it is in the Christian church
[1:44:14] today.
[1:44:18] They are afraid. That's the reason they
[1:44:20] are because you are not taught right.
[1:44:27] &gt;&gt; Don't be fearful.
[1:44:32] Even if you fear,
[1:44:34] what what do you
[1:44:38] what do to help you?
[1:44:41] &gt;&gt; So many people here. I can ask you
[1:44:44] sisters here.
[1:44:46] Some of you have been in the message for
[1:44:48] 30, 40 years
[1:44:54] until now you feel as if you are
[1:44:55] sinners.
[1:45:01] When did you last sin?
[1:45:06] [Music]
[1:45:13] I told another brother one day
[1:45:17] he comes and tells about hey sin you're
[1:45:21] condemning you are sinning you hey
[1:45:24] you're sinning he says that was
[1:45:26] preaching I said my brother
[1:45:30] [Music]
[1:45:33] &gt;&gt; you are wasting time
[1:45:36] when you preach about mini skates you
[1:45:39] wasting time
[1:45:41] &gt;&gt; because my wife there has never put on a
[1:45:43] min for 30 years. So she'll be saying
[1:45:45] amen but doesn't help her. The message
[1:45:47] doesn't help her.
[1:45:58] &gt;&gt; She'll be saying amen. Amen.
[1:46:00] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:46:01] &gt;&gt; But for her, she has never worn a skate
[1:46:04] for a mean skate for maybe 30 years.
[1:46:07] Why? What's why?
[1:46:20] How does a message of min help you?
[1:46:27] Because a message which is coming to you
[1:46:30] has to take you from faith to faith.
[1:46:38] Not just condemning others.
[1:46:42] Others are condemned by what you your
[1:46:45] faith is doing.
[1:46:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:46:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:46:54] &gt;&gt; So if we keep faith,
[1:46:58] this place
[1:46:59] &gt;&gt; could be a beehive of the power of God
[1:47:02] buzzing around here.
[1:47:10] flying everywhere.
[1:47:16] &gt;&gt; People are always reminded of their
[1:47:17] shortcomings.
[1:47:23] Not of their victories.
[1:47:29] Amen. Young people up there,
[1:47:32] you got more victories than I have.
[1:47:41] My sister there. Your victory wear that
[1:47:45] long dress
[1:47:47] is much more than me preaching here
[1:47:55] because
[1:47:57] you are walking victory.
[1:48:02] Whenever you wear that long dress at
[1:48:05] University of Johansburg
[1:48:10] is victory unto the Lord. Victory unto
[1:48:14] the Lord.
[1:48:20] &gt;&gt; What did Gideon tell his
[1:48:23] to his army?
[1:48:28] Did you know what Hion told to his army?
[1:48:34] He told them he had discounted a lot of
[1:48:38] them.
[1:48:41] But he told them he told them started
[1:48:45] burning.
[1:48:49] What? What did he tell them?
[1:48:52] The sword of the the sword of the Lord.
[1:48:55] The sword of Gideon. The sword of the
[1:48:57] Lord. The sword of the sword of the
[1:49:02] sword of the sword of the Lord. The
[1:49:05] sword of the of the Lord of moving
[1:49:09] forward.
[1:49:15] &gt;&gt; The Lord of Aaron
[1:49:20] is the Lord of the Lord of
[1:49:28] Your car
[1:49:32] is car.
[1:49:35] &gt;&gt; Be careful that car.
[1:49:38] It's not yours.
[1:49:41] It's your car and it's off.
[1:49:51] And one day
[1:49:54] you think it's yours.
[1:49:57] You see your sister walking and you pass
[1:49:59] by.
[1:50:04] That's your car.
[1:50:07] It was of God.
[1:50:09] The son of God would have been inside
[1:50:11] there.
[1:50:14] If your brother can't walk into your
[1:50:16] house and drink tea is not the house of
[1:50:18] the Lord.
[1:50:25] That one is yours.
[1:50:31] &gt;&gt; If you have a house beautiful enough
[1:50:33] that the son of God, anyone in here
[1:50:36] cannot go in.
[1:50:43] That one is yours.
[1:50:49] is of God. Every son of God in here can
[1:50:51] go in there.
[1:51:03] The sight of the Lord
[1:51:06] is a sort of
[1:51:09] &gt;&gt; Yes. If you starting from today, if you
[1:51:11] see your sister walking, don't let her
[1:51:13] walk. Stop.
[1:51:23] You you can't have a car beautiful
[1:51:25] enough
[1:51:28] for the son of God.
[1:51:32] Your car can be beautiful enough that
[1:51:33] you can't pick son of son of Mr. but not
[1:51:37] for of God.
[1:51:45] You can leave the son of a walk.
[1:51:52] But the son of God.
[1:51:56] Amen. Amen. So be careful.
[1:51:59] Hallelujah.
[1:52:00] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:52:01] &gt;&gt; So whatever we are doing here,
[1:52:04] make sure each and every one of us
[1:52:07] we are on an equal footing.
[1:52:12] Whatever we have,
[1:52:14] we have asked from God,
[1:52:17] we cannot deny his children. What we
[1:52:19] have asking from
[1:52:26] one day
[1:52:28] the master
[1:52:30] came and he was approaching a fig tree.
[1:52:36] &gt;&gt; So the fig tree was very rudy enough.
[1:52:42] [Music]
[1:52:43] It was rude because it told Jesus,
[1:52:48] "I can't give you figs
[1:52:52] because it's not yet time.
[1:52:57] But when we see a dry tree
[1:53:01] going into the shakina glory
[1:53:05] very same night,
[1:53:07] it gave out its fruit inside it.
[1:53:14] The tree wanted the master to bake.
[1:53:21] I told my church, I'll never come one
[1:53:24] day and start preaching about tithing.
[1:53:29] No, the person doesn't need to beg your
[1:53:32] tithe.
[1:53:35] If you are a dead tree
[1:53:38] here overnight
[1:53:41] tomorrow
[1:53:43] there will be almonds growing around you
[1:53:48] &gt;&gt; because you are in the presence of the
[1:53:50] shakina growing
[1:53:53] the shakina is here
[1:53:57] yourself
[1:53:59] coming to church
[1:54:01] &gt;&gt; is a victory accepting collect baptism
[1:54:05] is a victory.
[1:54:08] Accepting the correct marriage
[1:54:11] is a victory.
[1:54:14] &gt;&gt; Accept a sent God prophet
[1:54:20] is a victory. Accepting God sent pastor
[1:54:26] is a victory. Count your blessings.
[1:54:36] My brother,
[1:54:38] &gt;&gt; we have taken
[1:54:40] &gt;&gt; something which the whole world has
[1:54:41] rejected
[1:54:48] was was with the prophet for a long
[1:54:50] time.
[1:54:53] He never believed in the seven seals.
[1:54:56] But we have never seen the prophet. But
[1:54:59] we have heard
[1:55:04] &gt;&gt; from our pastor here
[1:55:07] that the seals are open.
[1:55:11] &gt;&gt; I believe the seals are open.
[1:55:20] &gt;&gt; You know the problem with a church
[1:55:24] They, you know, the religion of Cain,
[1:55:29] &gt;&gt; the religion of Cain,
[1:55:31] &gt;&gt; religion
[1:55:33] &gt;&gt; is about trying to let God accept you as
[1:55:36] you are.
[1:55:40] No, God accepts his word.
[1:55:50] When Cain went wrong,
[1:55:55] He should have gone to brother Abel
[1:56:00] and say, "Brother,
[1:56:02] the Lord has rejected my my my my
[1:56:05] sacrifice.
[1:56:08] How did you do it?"
[1:56:11] But Kane wants God to accept him as he
[1:56:14] is.
[1:56:21] Kane should have gone to Abel.
[1:56:24] My brother, how can I do this?
[1:56:29] &gt;&gt; Everywhere
[1:56:31] you find the children of Cain,
[1:56:35] you find the same arrogance.
[1:56:41] They want God to accept them without
[1:56:43] following God's word.
[1:56:51] Kane wanted God to accept his sacrifice
[1:56:54] because he had the sacrifice.
[1:56:59] I have sacrificed. I have sacrificed. I
[1:57:02] have sacrificed. I have sacrificed. I
[1:57:05] have sacrificed for this church. I have
[1:57:07] sacrificed for this church. I have
[1:57:09] sacrificed for this church. God accept
[1:57:12] it.
[1:57:19] God was telling me
[1:57:23] that's not the way to sacrifice.
[1:57:29] &gt;&gt; No, but I've sacrificed.
[1:57:40] So you when his son came
[1:57:45] came he told his brothers brothers
[1:57:51] let's go and follow God to heaven
[1:57:56] so what we do yeah let's build a tower
[1:58:04] he wanted go to go and find God
[1:58:08] without repenting us.
[1:58:13] &gt;&gt; So I wanted to arrive in heaven
[1:58:16] without repenting.
[1:58:20] You can find the same spirit in a
[1:58:22] denominational person.
[1:58:28] Hallelujah. Amen. Amen. But faith
[1:58:32] &gt;&gt; is not imaginary.
[1:58:36] Faith is a direct revelation from God to
[1:58:41] you.
[1:58:46] My brother,
[1:58:48] &gt;&gt; especially those of you who are born in
[1:58:49] this me in this message,
[1:58:53] it's not the faith of your father.
[1:58:56] You got faith of your own.
[1:59:01] How many people have been born in this
[1:59:02] church and not they're not serving God
[1:59:04] today?
[1:59:08] But you are saving him.
[1:59:12] &gt;&gt; It's because God revealed something to
[1:59:15] you.
[1:59:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:59:23] &gt;&gt; So Abel rolled up the rock and made the
[1:59:27] church to worship a place.
[1:59:30] Faith isn't something that is imaginary.
[1:59:36] I I believe you are not seeing that I'm
[1:59:38] I'm reading quotations, isn't it?
[1:59:42] &gt;&gt; You are saying
[1:59:44] yeah because for me to say let's go to
[1:59:46] this book. Let's go to this book. Um
[1:59:49] I've got about 45 slides here. So might
[1:59:52] take us about two days. So let me just
[1:59:54] speak. You'll be following the you'll be
[1:59:57] following the quotations.
[2:00:00] Faith isn't something imaginary.
[2:00:05] Faith is a direct revelation.
[2:00:08] [Music]
[2:00:11] Revelation one says,
[2:00:15] "The revelation which God had
[2:00:20] which he gave to his son,
[2:00:25] But he sent it
[2:00:29] &gt;&gt; and signified it to John
[2:00:33] &gt;&gt; by his angel.
[2:00:37] &gt;&gt; And that angel is none other than
[2:00:39] William Marion brother.
[2:00:42] Amen. Amen.
[2:00:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:00:46] &gt;&gt; It's a revelation.
[2:00:48] It's not something which is mentally
[2:00:50] perceived.
[2:00:53] You cannot have you cannot please God
[2:00:57] without him
[2:01:01] giving you the ability to please him.
[2:01:07] That ability to please God
[2:01:12] is what we call faith.
[2:01:15] Remember when we testify to you in the
[2:01:19] streets,
[2:01:22] brother is he preaches in the in the
[2:01:25] trains.
[2:01:27] &gt;&gt; There might be 30 people sitting there.
[2:01:30] You know, baptism
[2:01:33] is not just sprinkling water
[2:01:38] taking water. Somebody took water.
[2:01:42] You find somebody says, "Ah, that's
[2:01:44] true.
[2:01:46] We find someone say I does it matter
[2:01:51] who made that one to say that is true
[2:01:56] and who made the other one to say
[2:02:00] it doesn't matter
[2:02:03] what taught able
[2:02:08] to offer a better sacrifice
[2:02:12] the same thing which I told you to be
[2:02:14] here
[2:02:18] You cannot teach people how to receive
[2:02:19] revelation
[2:02:24] &gt;&gt; because revelation is from God.
[2:02:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:02:30] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:36] &gt;&gt; When Peter
[2:02:38] &gt;&gt; talked about Jesus being the son of God,
[2:02:45] He told him, "Peter,
[2:02:49] &gt;&gt; that's not flesh and blood
[2:02:51] &gt;&gt; by the father."
[2:02:55] &gt;&gt; Faith is not something which can be
[2:02:57] mentally perceived.
[2:03:03] That is why when we are here, we follow
[2:03:08] a baptism which Peter taught us.
[2:03:14] We knew
[2:03:16] &gt;&gt; this man has got a direct revolution
[2:03:19] from
[2:03:26] &gt;&gt; So
[2:03:28] when you know that your pastor has got a
[2:03:30] direct revelation,
[2:03:35] you better follow what he says.
[2:03:49] Yes. Next slide, my brother. Let's read
[2:03:51] it together.
[2:03:54] That one. Amen.
[2:03:55] &gt;&gt; Let's just take where I have highlighted
[2:03:57] because the slides are too many.
[2:04:00] And when God sees a man
[2:04:04] that can receive revelations
[2:04:09] from above,
[2:04:11] he can trust that man
[2:04:15] and do something with him.
[2:04:23] And when God sees a man
[2:04:26] that can receive revelations
[2:04:29] from above,
[2:04:32] &gt;&gt; he can trust that man
[2:04:34] and do something.
[2:04:41] When it's revealed to him
[2:04:46] because he says no man can reveal but
[2:04:49] his father.
[2:04:53] So Peter was in contact with the spirit.
[2:05:00] &gt;&gt; He knows
[2:05:02] you also can be in contact with the
[2:05:04] spirit.
[2:05:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:09] &gt;&gt; Amen. So one day Peter a man with he we
[2:05:14] say Peter had he was in contact with the
[2:05:16] spirit
[2:05:19] Peter was uh in contact with the spirit
[2:05:22] isn't it?
[2:05:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:25] &gt;&gt; Peter sees Jesus walking
[2:05:30] on water. He says Lord if it's you let
[2:05:35] me come as well.
[2:05:39] So he went there
[2:05:41] &gt;&gt; and started walking on water.
[2:05:44] &gt;&gt; Peter walked on water.
[2:05:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:49] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:05:52] So
[2:05:55] &gt;&gt; something happened. Who did say
[2:05:58] Peter Petro?
[2:05:59] &gt;&gt; Let's start from there. I have high. I
[2:06:01] don't I don't want to uh he says I am
[2:06:06] going to walk because the word says I
[2:06:08] can I can walk
[2:06:12] but he looked at the waves
[2:06:15] how big the waves were
[2:06:19] he got scared when he did
[2:06:23] he went down
[2:06:26] he feared
[2:06:28] &gt;&gt; so what happened what he feared
[2:06:34] happened when he believed. He could walk
[2:06:38] and he walked.
[2:06:41] &gt;&gt; When he believed
[2:06:43] when he got scared,
[2:06:48] the substance left him. Sorry there. The
[2:06:51] sub his substance left him.
[2:06:56] Amen.
[2:06:56] &gt;&gt; He still professed to have faith, but he
[2:06:58] didn't have the substance.
[2:07:04] So when you can believe
[2:07:07] it will happen.
[2:07:10] &gt;&gt; When you cannot believe
[2:07:13] it will not happen.
[2:07:17] That's why all the time brother every
[2:07:19] day only
[2:07:22] believe
[2:07:30] [Music]
[2:07:32] all things are possible.
[2:07:36] [Music]
[2:07:43] Every time the prophet
[2:07:45] he went into the grave
[2:07:49] only believe.
[2:07:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:53] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:54] &gt;&gt; That common faith my brother
[2:08:03] in the book of Job.
[2:08:05] &gt;&gt; Did you do did you know what happened to
[2:08:06] Job?
[2:08:08] Job feared
[2:08:11] and what he feared
[2:08:14] actually happened.
[2:08:17] What brought it?
[2:08:20] His fear.
[2:08:24] That's what made it to happen that he
[2:08:26] should lose his children.
[2:08:31] His faith would have kept him from it.
[2:08:36] But his faith
[2:08:39] brought it on him.
[2:08:42] He was scared that it will happen
[2:08:46] that one day he will lose his children.
[2:08:53] Do you see that's a quotation?
[2:08:56] Amen.
[2:08:58] &gt;&gt; What he feared
[2:09:00] happened
[2:09:02] &gt;&gt; but have faith
[2:09:06] like a child.
[2:09:08] Amen.
[2:09:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:09:14] Oh,
[2:09:16] &gt;&gt; if this holy church
[2:09:19] only realize its power
[2:09:23] to do the things,
[2:09:26] there's so much doubt and fear and
[2:09:28] trembling and wondering here.
[2:09:33] Not not
[2:09:36] there's so much doubting
[2:09:40] wondering
[2:09:45] would it happen
[2:09:47] as long as that exists
[2:09:50] [Music]
[2:09:51] the church can never stand upright.
[2:09:56] But when every talk of fear vanishes,
[2:10:01] that's why the minister stop making
[2:10:03] people fear here. Let the talk of fear
[2:10:06] vanish here.
[2:10:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:13] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:14] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:10:17] Uh
[2:10:23] when when uh Melody
[2:10:27] &gt;&gt; Sundowns
[2:10:29] &gt;&gt; is waiting for pirates to come
[2:10:34] the coach tells them
[2:10:37] don't fear don't fear. So when they come
[2:10:40] near the ground they start jumping
[2:10:45] jumping they tell pirates
[2:10:48] &gt;&gt; today you are going to see things
[2:10:55] all talk of fear vanishes the captain
[2:10:58] tells
[2:11:02] stand
[2:11:05] put more power
[2:11:08] put more Stand
[2:11:15] stand.
[2:11:19] 50/50 50. Press.
[2:11:25] Don't fear him.
[2:11:28] What they are trying to do is to make
[2:11:30] fear vanish.
[2:11:35] When fear vanishes,
[2:11:38] You will see what will happen to you.
[2:11:43] [Applause]
[2:11:50] When fear vanishes, the Holy Spirit is
[2:11:54] completely in control of the church
[2:11:59] and all fear is gone
[2:12:02] and the church has got power.
[2:12:07] Amen.
[2:12:07] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:08] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:09] &gt;&gt; You tell the devil,
[2:12:11] &gt;&gt; you are the ambassadors of the throne.
[2:12:16] &gt;&gt; Absolutely.
[2:12:18] &gt;&gt; You are an ambassador of Christ.
[2:12:21] &gt;&gt; We we got the power in the name of Jesus
[2:12:25] Christ.
[2:12:28] Amen.
[2:12:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:12:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. So uh the time which I was
[2:12:34] uh in school we are still fighting the
[2:12:37] bulas.
[2:12:40] &gt;&gt; So they come with guns.
[2:12:42] So the boys
[2:12:47] they coming with guns like this
[2:12:50] but they were fighting with
[2:12:52] power is with us.
[2:12:56] They didn't fear
[2:12:58] &gt;&gt; because once you have fear,
[2:13:01] the enemy will take you for granted.
[2:13:08] Amen.
[2:13:09] &gt;&gt; There was no fear.
[2:13:12] You will hear, "Oh, they have short
[2:13:13] three, four, 10.
[2:13:16] Tomorrow
[2:13:18] they back in the streets."
[2:13:22] Amen.
[2:13:24] Because they were shooting the people so
[2:13:27] that the others should say if we go back
[2:13:30] they will shoot us.
[2:13:35] The devil will shoot you.
[2:13:38] Don't go back.
[2:13:44] How many people will backslide here?
[2:13:49] Start jumping. Amanda
[2:13:55] We have the power.

[2:14:03] right in your hands.

[2:14:23] The whole powers of heaven
[2:14:27] is with.
[2:14:32] &gt;&gt; So whatever the devil can do,
[2:14:34] try to scare us, scare us this way,
[2:14:38] scare us this way, start jumping.
[2:14:45] The power is with us.
[2:14:48] We don't have the guns. We don't have
[2:14:50] the bullets. We don't have the nuclear.
[2:14:54] But the power is with us.
[2:15:00] And the church is barren because
[2:15:04] we don't recognize that the power is
[2:15:06] with us.
[2:15:16] Hallelujah. Amen. We didn't recognize
[2:15:18] it.
[2:15:20] I believe you see you see that's a
[2:15:21] quotation.
[2:15:24] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:25] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:15:28] &gt;&gt; Joshua one day
[2:15:32] &gt;&gt; stopped the sun.
[2:15:41] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you the physics.
[2:15:46] &gt;&gt; The sun, the earth
[2:15:49] is rotating
[2:15:52] at 1,600 km per hour
[2:15:56] and is landing
[2:15:58] 100,000 km/ hour around the sun
[2:16:03] and the sun is orbiting
[2:16:07] the Milky Way galaxy
[2:16:10] at 1 million km/ hour
[2:16:14] and our galaxy
[2:16:16] is moving around the other the universe.
[2:16:18] Yes.
[2:16:20] 2.2
[2:16:22] million km per hour.
[2:16:24] &gt;&gt; 2.2 million kilometers per hour. Joshua
[2:16:27] says stop.
[2:16:40] That's why maybe the scientist cannot
[2:16:42] cannot accept it because
[2:16:50] says
[2:16:52] &gt;&gt; that was nothing.
[2:16:54] &gt;&gt; It was very little
[2:16:57] because Joshua
[2:17:00] &gt;&gt; was dealing with material which was
[2:17:02] already there.
[2:17:07] But when it comes to the creation of the
[2:17:09] squirrels,
[2:17:14] &gt;&gt; God created the squirrels from nothing.
[2:17:22] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:17:25] &gt;&gt; Powerful.
[2:17:30] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:17:32] Joshua
[2:17:34] was dealing with material which was
[2:17:37] already there.
[2:17:43] &gt;&gt; The creation of the squirrels.
[2:17:47] Yeah, that one my brother.
[2:17:49] &gt;&gt; Yeah, that that was perfect faith.
[2:17:54] No vision.
[2:17:56] Just speak.
[2:17:58] Never saw a squirrel.
[2:18:01] He just that's just scripture
[2:18:05] speak doubt
[2:18:08] and I took God at his word
[2:18:11] and there it was.
[2:18:12] &gt;&gt; That's right. A friend as your pastor.
[2:18:17] That's as powerful as it was when
[2:18:22] Joshua stopped the sunsh
[2:18:24] because the son was already there.
[2:18:28] &gt;&gt; He just stopped the movement.
[2:18:31] But this he brought something
[2:18:35] that wasn't there.
[2:18:39] &gt;&gt; He created.
[2:18:43] I'm so glad to be acquainted with a God
[2:18:45] that can take dust of the earth.
[2:18:54] Someday
[2:18:56] when you be lying in the grave
[2:18:59] regardless wherever your dust will be,
[2:19:03] God will just call it up.
[2:19:07] Amen.
[2:19:08] &gt;&gt; The way he caught the squirrels.
[2:19:14] Amen.
[2:19:14] &gt;&gt; Praise God. Amen.
[2:19:17] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:19:21] The church
[2:19:23] can can only thrive.
[2:19:30] The church cannot thrive
[2:19:34] until the supernatural
[2:19:38] is made known to them.
[2:19:41] Do you see why the pastors always want
[2:19:43] you to know the supernatural?
[2:19:51] You cannot thrive as a church.
[2:19:54] Something supernatural is happening.
[2:19:59] [Applause]
[2:20:02] You need a God which you can talk to.
[2:20:06] And can talk back to you.
[2:20:11] That's the God you need. You need a God
[2:20:14] which you can talk to.
[2:20:20] Amen.
[2:20:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:25] &gt;&gt; Let me uh jump a few ones.
[2:20:29] So, how does faith come?
[2:20:33] &gt;&gt; By hearing,
[2:20:34] &gt;&gt; by
[2:20:36] you go to number 24, my brother
[2:20:40] Jeremiah Jeremiah
[2:20:42] 3:15.
[2:20:43] I will give you pastor's offering
[2:20:47] to my own heart
[2:20:50] which will feed you with knowledge
[2:20:54] and understanding.
[2:20:57] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:20:58] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:58] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:20:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:20:59] &gt;&gt; So when you see the pastor is trying to
[2:21:01] make sure that you get this, you get
[2:21:03] this, you get this,
[2:21:07] he's trying to fulfill Jeremiah 3 verse
[2:21:10] 15.
[2:21:13] Jeremiah 3:15.
[2:21:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:21:16] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:21:18] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:21:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:21] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:21:25] &gt;&gt; No, we don't need you don't need your
[2:21:27] pastor. No. Okay, that's fine.
[2:21:30] &gt;&gt; But remember,
[2:21:33] &gt;&gt; the word is
[2:21:35] &gt;&gt; the word is a sword.
[2:21:39] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:41] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:21:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:43] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:44] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:45] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:46] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:21:47] &gt;&gt; The word is what?
[2:21:51] &gt;&gt; But a sword
[2:21:53] &gt;&gt; doesn't go to war.
[2:22:00] &gt;&gt; It needs a strong hand
[2:22:04] [Applause]
[2:22:05] for it to work.
[2:22:09] Hallelujah.
[2:22:16] &gt;&gt; This is a quotation which I have.
[2:22:18] &gt;&gt; What do we do?
[2:22:20] &gt;&gt; Take the sword which is the word of God.
[2:22:24] Pull it with a hand of faith.
[2:22:29] A strong hand of faith.
[2:22:33] The word of God on its own. We have the
[2:22:36] word. We have the word. You need to have
[2:22:38] a strong hand of faith.
[2:22:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:22:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:22:49] &gt;&gt; The word on its own can do nothing
[2:22:54] unless it's held by a strong hand of
[2:22:57] faith.
[2:23:02] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:23:03] &gt;&gt; Amen. So even though the sword be the to
[2:23:06] be the word
[2:23:09] [Music]
[2:23:10] it takes the strong hand of faith
[2:23:15] &gt;&gt; to hold it there
[2:23:17] &gt;&gt; and bring it to the heart of the enemy.
[2:23:24] Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:23:25] &gt;&gt; So stop dancing. We have the word. You
[2:23:27] have the word. No. No. No. Where's
[2:23:28] Where's your faith?
[2:23:34] Because the word has to be held by a
[2:23:37] strong hand of faith.
[2:23:44] Amen. Amen.
[2:23:48] &gt;&gt; I hold faith key in my hand.
[2:23:58] in my heart that says God
[2:24:01] that will quench the virus of fire.
[2:24:08] It will unlock the healing.
[2:24:11] It will unlock salvation
[2:24:15] knowing that you got a key faith.
[2:24:21] Amen.
[2:24:22] &gt;&gt; Amen. So the sword of the king
[2:24:27] &gt;&gt; is the word
[2:24:29] &gt;&gt; but the word
[2:24:31] &gt;&gt; needs to be held up by a strong hand of
[2:24:34] faith.
[2:24:41] You know South Africa has got very big
[2:24:44] guns and Malawi
[2:24:49] but if their soldiers are not fit
[2:24:53] they can be defeated.
[2:25:01] So you have to have good guns
[2:25:05] and you also have to have soldiers which
[2:25:07] are fit.
[2:25:14] 29. My brother, that's why the church
[2:25:17] has done these things.
[2:25:20] &gt;&gt; All the gifts to go God, you just pin
[2:25:22] them up.
[2:25:26] They're not usable.
[2:25:29] Let them loose.
[2:25:32] Exercise your faith.
[2:25:35] Get some muscles in your faith.
[2:25:39] [Music]
[2:25:41] Let me tell you, faith has got hairs on
[2:25:44] its chest.
[2:25:53] When faith speaks,
[2:25:56] everything settles down.
[2:26:00] When it speaks,
[2:26:02] everything shuts down.
[2:26:06] Faith has to have chest hair on his
[2:26:08] chest.
[2:26:12] &gt;&gt; Faith is a boss
[2:26:17] and it's got big muscles.
[2:26:22] It's It's a quotation, my brother.
[2:26:29] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:26:30] It's got big muscles.
[2:26:35] All worries drop from the side of the
[2:26:36] other.
[2:26:44] &gt;&gt; All worries should disappear.
[2:26:47] &gt;&gt; Let your worries.
[2:26:59] Amen.
[2:27:03] &gt;&gt; You know sometimes we forget who we are.
[2:27:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:27:12] &gt;&gt; We forget.
[2:27:17] &gt;&gt; Um it's like uh Mr. Laposa's son uh
[2:27:22] worrying about buying a car.
[2:27:32] Because if you son
[2:27:35] your word is not about having a car.
[2:27:39] What your is to say can I get a
[2:27:41] Lamborghini
[2:27:44] or a Bugatti or that's your worry.
[2:27:52] If I go to if I go to that garage am I
[2:27:54] going to find a car of my size?
[2:27:59] Your problem is not the dollars. Your
[2:28:01] problem is about the if you the car
[2:28:03] which are there can be of your type.
[2:28:14] V8 V8.
[2:28:16] &gt;&gt; You're looking for a V16.
[2:28:27] &gt;&gt; That's what faith should give you.
[2:28:30] &gt;&gt; Don't be fearful. You have everything.
[2:28:37] Our
[2:28:42] world is not about South Africa or
[2:28:44] whether I can buy a plot or a word.
[2:28:50] No sons of God. Can I just create my own
[2:28:54] land, my own planet so I can live on it?
[2:29:05] The sons and daughters of God would
[2:29:07] create the world out there and go and
[2:29:09] live a private life on it.
[2:29:16] It's a quotation there.
[2:29:20] You have the power to do that.
[2:29:25] You can even create your own small earth
[2:29:28] somewhere and you go and live a private
[2:29:30] life on it.
[2:29:32] It's not me. We speaking.
[2:29:34] Do you understand? It's not me. We
[2:29:35] speaking.
[2:29:37] &gt;&gt; We speaking that
[2:29:44] in you.
[2:29:46] There's power to create a world up
[2:29:48] there. You go and live there in private
[2:29:53] life.
[2:29:56] You have power to do it.
[2:29:58] Amen. You got just a shadow of the power
[2:30:00] of God in you,
[2:30:06] but you got power to do it. God is
[2:30:09] omnipotent.
[2:30:13] The power in you will make you
[2:30:17] speak a word into existence
[2:30:22] and go and live on it.
[2:30:26] Amen.
[2:30:28] Hey my brother,
[2:30:30] &gt;&gt; you're being living in a rented house.
[2:30:32] Yet you got power to create the whole
[2:30:34] world.
[2:30:43] &gt;&gt; Speak it.
[2:30:53] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:30:54] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:30:56] One day
[2:30:58] &gt;&gt; he told Moses
[2:31:00] &gt;&gt; go to that rock
[2:31:02] &gt;&gt; it will give you it water.
[2:31:06] &gt;&gt; How many geologists here?
[2:31:10] &gt;&gt; What what percentage of water is in the
[2:31:12] rock?
[2:31:18] The hardest thing you can ever get water
[2:31:20] from is a rock.
[2:31:27] Moses was able to get water from a rock
[2:31:33] to feed two million people
[2:31:37] &gt;&gt; with their goats, cows,
[2:31:41] chickens.
[2:31:44] Yeah.

[2:31:58] being. But

[2:32:15] are sons and daughters of God
[2:32:20] coequal with Jesus
[2:32:23] &gt;&gt; in his presence.
[2:32:27] Oh my. Oh my. That's what makes the
[2:32:29] devil angry
[2:32:32] is to let this church

[2:33:21] a spiritual touch.
[2:33:28] &gt;&gt; Remember,
[2:33:30] it is you
[2:33:32] &gt;&gt; who drives the gift in your pastor.
[2:33:34] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:33:41] When Hana was praying,
[2:33:45] when Eli
[2:33:48] &gt;&gt; who was a backseated minister,
[2:33:53] &gt;&gt; bride
[2:33:55] saw him saw her praying
[2:33:59] says woman,
[2:34:02] hey, what is your trouble?
[2:34:05] says, "Oh no,
[2:34:08] your your handmmaid is in trouble."
[2:34:13] Eli didn't ask Hannah, "What is it?" He
[2:34:19] just said, "Whatever you have been
[2:34:21] praying,
[2:34:23] God grants it."
[2:34:30] Whatever you've been praying,
[2:34:32] God grants it.
[2:34:37] Amen.
[2:34:38] &gt;&gt; Didn't even ask her what was it a car?
[2:34:40] Was it a house?
[2:34:42] He just said, "Hannah,
[2:34:44] go your way."
[2:34:47] Whatever you pray, God.
[2:34:50] The woman with a blood issue,
[2:34:54] no one had been had been healed
[2:34:58] by touching Jesus, but herself.
[2:35:03] Something inside her
[2:35:06] told her that man which others are
[2:35:09] slapping,
[2:35:11] others are are talking nonsense about
[2:35:14] just go and touch him.
[2:35:19] Let all others say whatever they want to
[2:35:21] say.
[2:35:23] Some are even spitting in his face.
[2:35:26] She was a nobody.
[2:35:29] But to her,
[2:35:33] she just touched.
[2:35:35] She got everything.
[2:35:41] He didn't mind what the Pharisees said.
[2:35:45] She didn't mind what the Pharisees said.
[2:35:49] She didn't mind what the scribes said.
[2:35:52] She just knew if I could just touch,
[2:36:00] &gt;&gt; hey, let's talk about Auntie Jamaima

[2:36:10] Amen. Amen.
[2:36:14] We we have brother Martin here.
[2:36:22] Uh actually when it's raining
[2:36:26] light rain
[2:36:28] &gt;&gt; can help propel the jet faster even than
[2:36:31] when it's not raining.
[2:36:34] But if there's too much water,
[2:36:36] it can give the frame to go out.
[2:36:40] God put enough water in the air there
[2:36:45] to kill the engineers. They said, "No,
[2:36:47] this water is too much. Let's land."
[2:36:52] &gt;&gt; What stop? What? What? What did put the
[2:36:54] water there?
[2:36:58] &gt;&gt; God. Because Jamaima was praying.
[2:37:04] Auntie Jamaima was not from
[2:37:10] auntie.
[2:37:12] &gt;&gt; Didn't even know who was
[2:37:17] But her prayer
[2:37:19] &gt;&gt; drove brother Brham
[2:37:22] Brotherham.
[2:37:23] &gt;&gt; It is your faith.
[2:37:26] &gt;&gt; Don't blame the pastor.

[2:37:34] the gift in the pastor.
[2:37:39] Amen.
[2:37:44] say the truth.
[2:37:47] It drove brother Brham
[2:37:49] &gt;&gt; says sister heartlight

[2:38:00] &gt;&gt; and that day sister if you wanted to be
[2:38:02] a billionaire I would have become a
[2:38:03] billionaire immediately
[2:38:18] Faith
[2:38:20] &gt;&gt; is a long range vision.
[2:38:25] Those of us who have got faith,
[2:38:28] &gt;&gt; then we got we we don't need to see
[2:38:29] visions
[2:38:32] &gt;&gt; because we already got a vision.
[2:38:37] Amen.
[2:38:38] &gt;&gt; Faith sees what God wants to be done.
[2:38:46] &gt;&gt; Faith doesn't look at the present time.
[2:38:48] [Music]
[2:38:51] Faith doesn't see this here.
[2:38:55] Faith looks at what God wants.
[2:39:00] It sees what God wants.
[2:39:03] And what God has done,
[2:39:05] &gt;&gt; faith is a long range vision.
[2:39:09] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:39:13] &gt;&gt; It doesn't lower it sight.
[2:39:17] &gt;&gt; It holds the target.
[2:39:21] Amen.
[2:39:22] &gt;&gt; It's a long length telescope.
[2:39:27] We are not looking here. We are looking
[2:39:29] there.
[2:39:31] Jesus.
[2:39:34] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:39:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:39:36] &gt;&gt; Faith is our victory.
[2:39:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:39:41] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:39:44] &gt;&gt; But the the attitude of so many people
[2:39:49] we are so much there's so much drifting.
[2:39:53] We are drifters.
[2:39:55] We just move along.
[2:40:04] until you are drifting about pastors,
[2:40:07] preachers, what just drifting.
[2:40:11] &gt;&gt; With the coming of the
[2:40:15] with the coming of the streaming now you
[2:40:17] stream that, you stream that and you
[2:40:19] start collecting your pastor because
[2:40:21] when you streaming you had something
[2:40:22] else.
[2:40:38] You're a drifter.
[2:40:40] &gt;&gt; No. No. No. How are you going to How are
[2:40:43] you going to walk along on the seats of
[2:40:45] remember?
[2:40:47] &gt;&gt; Driftwood
[2:40:49] &gt;&gt; is wood.
[2:40:51] A boat
[2:40:54] drift, you know, driftwood. It's like a
[2:40:57] tree which is just moving in water.
[2:41:02] It's wood, isn't it?
[2:41:08] A boat
[2:41:10] &gt;&gt; is wood.
[2:41:12] But the difference between a boat and
[2:41:14] driftwood,
[2:41:21] the driftwood doesn't have shape.
[2:41:27] The boat is shaped by the master
[2:41:32] and is powered by the master.
[2:41:35] Doesn't just move along with the water.
[2:41:39] The the boat moves with the power of the
[2:41:43] master.
[2:41:46] It goes where the master wants it to go.
[2:41:52] It doesn't just go and here
[2:42:06] a boat
[2:42:08] and a driftwood
[2:42:11] they are made of the same material.
[2:42:14] But the problem is the other one has got
[2:42:16] a master
[2:42:19] and the other one has got power from the
[2:42:21] master
[2:42:26] &gt;&gt; and is controlled by the power of the
[2:42:27] master
[2:42:31] and it does what the master says.
[2:42:36] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:42:38] Uh
[2:42:40] hey my brother is
[2:42:42] &gt;&gt; um
[2:42:47] you know these things they come from
[2:42:49] parents
[2:42:54] &gt;&gt; because uh
[2:42:58] if your parents are rich
[2:43:02] &gt;&gt; then you're also rich.
[2:43:07] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah.
[2:43:08] &gt;&gt; Okay.
[2:43:09] &gt;&gt; Oh yeah.
[2:43:17] You even before you start working
[2:43:22] because you got a rich father
[2:43:31] and most of the times
[2:43:34] children of rich children fathers they
[2:43:36] become rich themselves.
[2:43:41] because they are born rich. They see
[2:43:43] riches. They see how they make rich.
[2:43:50] Most of times if you your parents were
[2:43:52] rich,
[2:43:55] [Music]
[2:44:01] I'm telling the truth.
[2:44:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:44:07] &gt;&gt; They go to rich schools.
[2:44:10] &gt;&gt; It runs in the family.
[2:44:13] &gt;&gt; So why do you want to leave miserable
[2:44:15] when our father is rich?
[2:44:23] If you're rich, you don't survive on a
[2:44:24] quart and coke. You survive on balanced
[2:44:26] diet.
[2:44:28] [Music]
[2:44:33] Yeah.
[2:44:36] Yeah.
[2:44:38] 39 my brother.
[2:44:41] 39.
[2:44:43] You don't survive on a quarter.

[2:44:59] seal

[2:45:02] don't just eat
[2:45:07] long dress. Long dress. Long dress. No.
[2:45:09] No. You survive on the 307.
[2:45:13] [Music]
[2:45:17] &gt;&gt; Yeah. My father drove a secondhand cars.
[2:45:23] Me, I drive a 3 liter.
[2:45:26] L. My son should drive a V8.
[2:45:33] &gt;&gt; The only person who wishes you better
[2:45:35] than him is your father.
[2:45:45] God bless person.
[2:45:48] [Applause]
[2:45:56] People will say today was just driving
[2:45:59] about V8.
[2:46:04] Oh, let me give you a quotation.
[2:46:12] quotation.
[2:46:16] Here it is.
[2:46:19] Believest thou this. My grandfather rode
[2:46:22] on an ox cut.
[2:46:26] I am driving a Ford V8.
[2:46:30] My son should fly a jet.
[2:46:38] That's your That's your prophet.
[2:46:43] Amen.
[2:46:47] &gt;&gt; Your faith
[2:46:49] &gt;&gt; goes into your son
[2:46:51] and your son should do better than you
[2:46:57] and those who follow should do better
[2:46:59] than them.
[2:47:02] That is why when they were coming of
[2:47:04] Egypt,
[2:47:06] God said these people are not doing well
[2:47:09] with the word.
[2:47:10] let their sons do it
[2:47:13] because he knew their sons will fulfill
[2:47:16] the word better than the fathers.
[2:47:25] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen.
[2:47:31] &gt;&gt; We are living far with what we should
[2:47:35] have been living. We are living
[2:47:36] underprivileged.
[2:47:40] Because we are not holding on to our
[2:47:42] faith.
[2:47:48] We are living a million miles under our
[2:47:50] privilege. Tonight,
[2:47:59] privileges of Christians to be enjoying

[2:48:24] Remove fear.
[2:48:31] &gt;&gt; You are more than powerful.
[2:48:41] We need to be connected.
[2:48:46] &gt;&gt; The way a man was connected in the
[2:48:47] garden of Eden.
[2:48:54] I was going to choke it out,
[2:48:57] but I'm going to say man is omnipotent.
[2:49:04] You don't believe that? But he is a man
[2:49:07] fully surrendered to God
[2:49:12] is omnipotent.
[2:49:17] Amen.
[2:49:19] &gt;&gt; Mark 11 Mark 11
[2:49:22] 22 verse 22. Whatever say things you say
[2:49:27] and don't doubt

[2:49:39] &gt;&gt; What happens when two importants meet?
[2:49:46] &gt;&gt; Man and God
[2:49:49] coming together two ominants.
[2:49:54] Hey, something is going to shake.
[2:49:59] Something's going to shake.
[2:50:02] Amen.
[2:50:03] &gt;&gt; Which man?
[2:50:05] &gt;&gt; You and God.
[2:50:08] &gt;&gt; The two of you.
[2:50:10] &gt;&gt; If you can meet
[2:50:17] Hallelujah.
[2:50:21] Don't
[2:50:24] The power in you
[2:50:27] comes at taking God at his word.
[2:50:36] Brother, we we spend sleepless nights
[2:50:40] trying to figure out how we're going to
[2:50:42] do this, that, this, that. We just
[2:50:45] waited upon God.
[2:50:56] God will do something
[2:50:58] &gt;&gt; because God likes to display his power.
[2:51:06] God likes to bring you in trouble.
[2:51:10] He loves to put trouble down
[2:51:14] and see what you're going to do about
[2:51:15] it.
[2:51:20] So he just stopped at the lead sea.
[2:51:23] The next thing you know,
[2:51:25] they marched against that place
[2:51:29] and he sent Pharaoh after them.
[2:51:33] See how God likes to do it.
[2:51:37] He love to display his power.
[2:51:41] He is God.
[2:51:43] He just likes to show you
[2:51:46] who is
[2:51:48] [Music]
[2:51:50] Amen.
[2:51:52] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:51:53] &gt;&gt; The trouble today
[2:51:55] is people think that the days of the
[2:51:57] miracles are passed.
[2:52:02] But his word is here.
[2:52:05] The miracles needs to be here.
[2:52:13] God loves to manifest himself.
[2:52:18] Amen.
[2:52:19] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:52:19] &gt;&gt; So we have faith.
[2:52:21] &gt;&gt; Faith is our victory.
[2:52:24] &gt;&gt; Faith overcomes.
[2:52:27] &gt;&gt; Faith is victory over death.
[2:52:30] &gt;&gt; Faith is victory over sin.
[2:52:33] Faith is victory over sickness.
[2:52:36] Faith is victory over worries.
[2:52:40] Faith is victory over frustrations.
[2:52:45] Faith is victory over the world.
[2:52:52] &gt;&gt; We shall overcome
[2:52:54] &gt;&gt; by the power of the Holy Ghost.
[2:53:01] &gt;&gt; You are an overcomer, my brother.
[2:53:05] Just come to church here.
[2:53:10] You know, if they going to make you a
[2:53:12] soldier,
[2:53:15] They tell you
[2:53:17] &gt;&gt; my brother
[2:53:20] uh come here.
[2:53:22] You're coming from home
[2:53:24] but you want to become a soldier.
[2:53:28] &gt;&gt; Yes.
[2:53:29] &gt;&gt; So they find such a
[2:53:32] those of you who are in the army know
[2:53:35] they find a person
[2:53:38] which is
[2:53:40] very very strong.
[2:53:43] They don't find a weakling.
[2:53:47] No, they find a strong.
[2:53:50] &gt;&gt; They say, "All of you who want to become
[2:53:52] soldiers,
[2:53:55] follow him.
[2:53:58] They find,
[2:54:00] hey brother, there are people there
[2:54:03] who can run like a horse.
[2:54:06] Most of them are in the army."
[2:54:09] So they say, "Follow him.
[2:54:12] He starts running.
[2:54:14] You think he stops

[2:54:31] &gt;&gt; 25
[2:54:32] &gt;&gt; 25
[2:54:35] &gt;&gt; and they'll be coming behind.
[2:54:39] If you stop at 15,
[2:54:41] &gt;&gt; they say you have failed interview.
[2:54:44] If you stop here,
[2:54:47] you have failed interview.
[2:54:49] So some failed on baptism.
[2:54:53] We told them
[2:55:00] Yeah.
[2:55:02] Mhm. Uhhuh. Uhhuh. Yes, sir.
[2:55:11] Some failed failed on wearing of
[2:55:13] trousers. Women,

[2:55:38] You have to follow him.
[2:55:42] [Music]
[2:55:44] Do you know what happens when the
[2:55:46] measure is running in the front?
[2:55:49] &gt;&gt; He doesn't worry about those who are
[2:55:50] remaining behind.
[2:55:54] He knows that those who are going to be
[2:55:55] soldiers,
[2:55:57] they'll be following me.
[2:56:12] So whatever you fail,
[2:56:17] use your faith
[2:56:21] &gt;&gt; because faith is a conqueror.
[2:56:24] &gt;&gt; Faith is greater than your sin.
[2:56:28] &gt;&gt; Faith is an overcomer.

[2:56:43] world.

[2:56:46] We are going to conquer this world.
[2:56:49] We are going to beat it down.
[2:56:52] Amen.
[2:56:54] Amen.
[2:56:57] &gt;&gt; It means
[2:56:58] &gt;&gt; that sin
[2:57:00] &gt;&gt; that once ruled you
[2:57:04] &gt;&gt; cannot rule you anymore.
[2:57:10] &gt;&gt; You whipped it.
[2:57:12] &gt;&gt; You are greater than your sin.
[2:57:19] Hallelujah. When you go home today,
[2:57:23] God then says, "Scare your sin."
[2:57:27] &gt;&gt; Sin.
[2:57:30] I'll be back.
[2:57:47] Yeah.
[2:57:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:57:48] &gt;&gt; Tell tell your sin.

[2:57:57] &gt;&gt; You're not surrendering.
[2:58:01] &gt;&gt; No, no, no. You're going back. After
[2:58:03] this, you're going to tell your sin,
[2:58:06] &gt;&gt; my friend.
[2:58:08] Maybe you beaten me today by tomorrow.
[2:58:12] I'll be back.
[2:58:20] &gt;&gt; You know when there's a fighter,
[2:58:24] &gt;&gt; he can fight a friend today.
[2:58:28] He's defeated.
[2:58:30] He goes home,
[2:58:32] &gt;&gt; does 100 press ups.
[2:58:36] He He He calls his friend,
[2:58:38] "You know, he defeated me,
[2:58:41] &gt;&gt; but I'm coming back.
[2:58:44] Tell your s you're coming back.
[2:58:49] Tell your sickness, you're coming back."
[2:58:54] Because faith knows no defeat.
[2:59:02] It cannot be defeated.
[2:59:06] &gt;&gt; Even death itself can't defeat it.
[2:59:12] It knows no defeat.
[2:59:19] &gt;&gt; Trials
[2:59:22] knows defeat,
[2:59:25] &gt;&gt; but faith knows no defeat.
[2:59:32] They not be defeated.
[2:59:35] &gt;&gt; And it is the only way
[2:59:38] you can please God.
[2:59:42] When you cannot know defeat
[2:59:46] when you fail, always come back more.
[2:59:54] Come back more.
[3:00:00] Hallelujah.
[3:00:01] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:00:02] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[3:00:03] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:00:04] &gt;&gt; Uh
[3:00:06] I don't know. I don't know where the
[3:00:08] football ground for S down is here in
[3:00:12] where is it?
[3:00:14] Which which side?
[3:00:16] &gt;&gt; Kemp.
[3:00:17] &gt;&gt; Kemp Park.
[3:00:20] Uh do you
[3:00:23] um those of you who live in Captain Park
[3:00:28] when Mamelo is winning you have to go
[3:00:30] and ask whether they are winning or not.
[3:00:38] I have lived near a stadium before
[3:00:41] in Malawi. I've lived near a stadium
[3:00:43] before. I don't even need to go there to
[3:00:45] know whether they are winning or not.
[3:00:50] No,
[3:00:52] from home I know that they are winning.
[3:01:02] &gt;&gt; Do you think that if M has won and the
[3:01:05] sun down in yellow would be this
[3:01:18] The first thing you will see is
[3:01:20] [Music]
[3:01:25] you know they are winning
[3:01:30] because that's what is there in the book
[3:01:33] of revelation.
[3:01:36] Revelation 17 tells us
[3:01:39] that that is on the sea of grass.
[3:01:43] They are singing
[3:01:47] songs of victory.
[3:01:52] &gt;&gt; So victory is a great word in English.
[3:01:59] &gt;&gt; The what is a great word in English.
[3:02:03] It means you have overcome the enemy.
[3:02:07] &gt;&gt; You are holding victory.
[3:02:10] &gt;&gt; We sing songs.
[3:02:12] and cheer in victory.
[3:02:18] &gt;&gt; One day,
[3:02:21] one day,
[3:02:23] &gt;&gt; one day
[3:02:25] &gt;&gt; it will happen
[3:02:27] that uh this body will just open up
[3:02:35] &gt;&gt; and I will start flying away.
[3:02:43] My brother that day
[3:02:46] John saw it
[3:02:48] &gt;&gt; and they cried victory.
[3:02:54] &gt;&gt; What has made us to overcome?
[3:02:57] &gt;&gt; Faith in his word.
[3:03:04] common faith
[3:03:09] things which we do
[3:03:12] as a child
[3:03:14] towards God.
[3:03:16] &gt;&gt; Don't try to supernaturalize faith.
[3:03:21] Brother says
[3:03:23] day faith
[3:03:28] that's what we need.
[3:03:30] &gt;&gt; We shall overcome.
[3:03:35] by the power of his word.
[3:03:39] &gt;&gt; We come here to church
[3:03:42] &gt;&gt; to build our muscles of faith
[3:03:46] so that we can pick up the sword
[3:03:50] which is the word
[3:03:52] and drive it to the heart of the enemy.
[3:03:57] God bless you. Amen. Amen.
[3:04:07] Oh,

[3:11:54] &gt;&gt; Gracious heavenly father,
[3:11:57] &gt;&gt; I will cling to this cross.
[3:12:00] Everything bad which would have happened
[3:12:02] to me has already happened.
[3:12:07] &gt;&gt; But still I cling to this old lugged
[3:12:10] cross.
[3:12:10] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[3:12:11] &gt;&gt; For I know my master
[3:12:14] &gt;&gt; did bear for me.
[3:12:16] &gt;&gt; Whatever my problems are, they are very
[3:12:18] little
[3:12:19] &gt;&gt; because you got all the burdens.
[3:12:22] &gt;&gt; All the fear doubts of the enemy landed
[3:12:25] on you. What is coming upon me is just
[3:12:28] dust.
[3:12:30] &gt;&gt; You took all the venom.
[3:12:34] &gt;&gt; You took all the poison.
[3:12:37] &gt;&gt; You drank all the ges.
[3:12:43] &gt;&gt; For me is to drink wine.
[3:12:46] &gt;&gt; Because they did take a sponge
[3:12:50] &gt;&gt; and put it in your wine. Old wine.
[3:12:54] They made you drink something which no
[3:12:57] human can drink.
[3:13:00] &gt;&gt; What's more is there left anymore.
[3:13:03] &gt;&gt; How bad can a person be treated than the
[3:13:06] way you were treated?
[3:13:08] &gt;&gt; Who am I?
[3:13:10] &gt;&gt; Lord Jesus I pray let me cling to this
[3:13:13] old lugged cross.
[3:13:16] &gt;&gt; As Peter said that day when he was
[3:13:17] sinking, Lord hold my hand.
[3:13:22] And you did hold his hand
[3:13:24] &gt;&gt; and he walked on water again with you.
[3:13:27] &gt;&gt; I want to walk with you, Lord.
[3:13:29] &gt;&gt; Let me walk with you, Jesus.
[3:13:33] Wherever I go, let me walk with you,
[3:13:34] Jesus.
[3:13:36] &gt;&gt; Here we are. Each and every one of you
[3:13:38] of us, Lord, looking for that hand.
[3:13:41] &gt;&gt; We are holding up our hand. We know
[3:13:43] there's a mighty hand up there. The same
[3:13:46] antl
[3:13:47] &gt;&gt; which took the children of Israel out of
[3:13:50] Egypt is here today.
[3:13:52] &gt;&gt; Lord hold me, guide me, teach me.
[3:13:56] &gt;&gt; I commit this church into thine holy
[3:13:57] hands.
[3:13:58] &gt;&gt; I commit pastor into thine holy hands.
[3:14:01] &gt;&gt; I commit the family into thy holy hands.
[3:14:04] &gt;&gt; I commit this church into thine holy
[3:14:05] hands. Father,

[3:14:10] &gt;&gt; Be bless them spiritually, physically,
[3:14:12] financially. Lord Jesus, it is you who
[3:14:15] has called us.
[3:14:17] &gt;&gt; It is you who knows the purpose of this
[3:14:20] battle. It is you who knows the cause of
[3:14:22] this battle. It is you who knows the end
[3:14:24] of this battle.
[3:14:26] &gt;&gt; Help us. Give us pray, Father, as I

[3:19:30] And we also want to thank the pastor,
[3:19:32] pastor Kodima, who saw it very important
[3:19:35] for you to be here. God bless him as

[3:23:13] the remission of sins, and ye shall
