He is the way. We must fight the beginning. He is the beginning. The Bible says all the is all. All in all, &gt;&gt; now I'm reading. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Here comes Philip. &gt;&gt; The first thing after he met the Messiah, he went after his brother. So they used to sit around the table coming. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now reading about it, waiting for for it to be made to dwell among them. Hallelujah.

You are born. &gt;&gt; We celebrate &gt;&gt; and you go to school. &gt;&gt; We celebrate &gt;&gt; while doing all these things. &gt;&gt; There's a place down there. What do you call it? They are busy creating a coffin for you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Sometimes, you know, I'm a pastor. &gt;&gt; Yeah. We want to make one for the pastors and one for the kings. &gt;&gt; Let me not frighten you. &gt;&gt; No, I I mean &gt;&gt; while we are celebrating When things are in process, somebody there is also working on a coffin. &gt;&gt; You get what I mean? &gt;&gt; Because he knows that that body is trop your soul. But so we are &gt;&gt; amen. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I'm keeping my eye on the clock. &gt;&gt; Let's see. &gt;&gt; And Nathaniel said unto him, &gt;&gt; now Philip says, &gt;&gt; "We have found him &gt;&gt; of whom &gt;&gt; Moses in the law and the prophets did write. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So that's why after he read about him after the book because it was no more. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. like the Holy Ghost.

Amen. &gt;&gt; He move. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. And are you listening? We have found him. &gt;&gt; This man was positive of whom Moses in the law &gt;&gt; the prophets did right. And Nathaniel said unto him, can any good thing come out of Nazareth? says unto him, "Come and see." Now, he didn't say, "Come and read, come and hear," but come and see. Amen. Amen. Because they have passed these other stages. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They have passed the hearing stage. &gt;&gt; I have heard but now I see. Amen. Hallelujah. Amen. As I said where I was employed here somebody came to advertise &gt;&gt; this catalog. So he opened up the catalog. Then you are saying to the my employers this is this electrical things &gt;&gt; and my employer together with the co-workers catalog this one is nice this one. So after that then they said to him &gt;&gt; now let us see. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let us see. &gt;&gt; So to advertise something, &gt;&gt; it's something else. It's a theory. &gt;&gt; You're talking about something that is not there. &gt;&gt; So after that they said, "Let us see." and he didn't have the stuff with him. So that old uh e man, he took that catalog your book &gt;&gt; since you don't have the goods. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know if you advertise something You must have it. &gt;&gt; Does this uh uh I will use a word that will not maybe do any damage like a thick set brother. &gt;&gt; Okay. So, they came to my advertising. So, they opened their catalog and said, &gt;&gt; as I've said, I've told you before, you know, myself, I was heavy. And so, they said to me, they targeted me because I was So they came with this stuff to help you to stay down. So they were talking to us said you see this one in a week's time you feel that you have all this time I was looking at them going one see this Once &gt;&gt; once in the morning within 3 weeks you will lose so so yeah but I was looking at the preaching the gospel you &gt;&gt; Jesus said Jesus made you holy Amen. Amen. If &gt;&gt; then he is he makes people holy &gt;&gt; and you are advertising that with you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. arrives here, &gt;&gt; come and see. &gt;&gt; He said to to Nathaniel, &gt;&gt; come and see. &gt;&gt; Now, there was something in Philip. &gt;&gt; Now, these people I'm talking about where that part of us, the ass of God. So as I said the other day, you know how Peter &gt;&gt; he came and they looked at that man who was a I think or something like that. Now we used to just sit by the gate there through some coins and so whatever. But when and they came. &gt;&gt; Now Peter said, "Silver and gold have me now. You can actually here comes Peter and John Last year we have something in &gt;&gt; he said look unto us the same that position to say to the people &gt;&gt; we don't have any church knowledge and look unto let us Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Peter, &gt;&gt; John, &gt;&gt; Johan, &gt;&gt; they were ask. So now &gt;&gt; here now here is part of the other members here &gt;&gt; the founders &gt;&gt; not just preachers &gt;&gt; but founders we have found we have read about we have how they &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; and Nathaniel &gt;&gt; Nathaniel &gt;&gt; and verse 41 41 &gt;&gt; this is wonderful 41 &gt;&gt; and no no verse 48 number 48 &gt;&gt; rather 47 Now after that &gt;&gt; Jesus saw Nathaniel coming unto him. &gt;&gt; Now that's more than reading. &gt;&gt; Amen. Jesus &gt;&gt; coming where? &gt;&gt; To him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Sometimes we like to go to church but not to him. &gt;&gt; Where we can enjoy ourselves. Glory. Glory. Hallelujah. Glory. Glory. Hallelujah. Amen. Hallelujah. Now the Bible says &gt;&gt; and said and the Lord when he saw Nathaniel he said of him is wonderful God says something now this was a personal Not just somebody help us. But now that was a personal thing. Then the Lord said no. I think something you know the people can praise you and say you are this and tomorrow they change. &gt;&gt; Exactly. We thought this exact but God say &gt;&gt; verse 41 &gt;&gt; 41 &gt;&gt; oh verse 40 one of the two who had who heard John speak and followed him was Peter's brother John find his own brother Simon said unto We have &gt;&gt; we have found him. &gt;&gt; It's a personal thing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Which is being interpreted the Christ &gt;&gt; brought him to Jesus. You must bring the people to &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Bring them to him. &gt;&gt; He knows A to Z with R to Z. &gt;&gt; He's the alpha and omega. &gt;&gt; Alpha and Omega. Because he said to &gt;&gt; before you &gt;&gt; he saw him before. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He brought him to to church. &gt;&gt; I think you are not with me now. &gt;&gt; And he brought him to to Jesus. And when Jesus beheld him, &gt;&gt; he saidimon thou shall be called by interpretation stone. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why he said, "Amen." Amen. &gt;&gt; I shall build my church &gt;&gt; upon the stone but was not upon the revelation of him. So this were the founders. Amen. Amen. Now today I'm going to be very very short in preparation for something. &gt;&gt; Now some are familiar with this &gt;&gt; but I'm going back to John 4. Amen. Amen. Now what I'm trying to talk about which maybe will take us hours uh to redeem time call. &gt;&gt; These people recognize that this man is the one Moses wrote about. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All this time they have heard about you. &gt;&gt; They have read about you but they were subjects waiting waiting for what for that way flesh. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So &gt;&gt; when they were put on flesh, &gt;&gt; those who were with him in the beginning. &gt;&gt; So here they come. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because they believe that &gt;&gt; he is in this tabernacle. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Peter said, of eternal life in you. &gt;&gt; How did Peter know that? &gt;&gt; Those beings, &gt;&gt; they were with him. Hallelujah. Did you read the scripture that says we were chosen in him for the foundation of amen? &gt;&gt; Now who came first? &gt;&gt; You or the world? &gt;&gt; All right. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why the Bible says you or sin. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; There were someies. Amen. Amen. Hey, &gt;&gt; you know they used to walk like this in their robes. He found them in the synagogue. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And they gave him the scroll. You know how they criticized him? So he opened the scroll. So there were someies this and that. Amen. Amen. But when he was on the scene. Amen. &gt;&gt; When he was on the scene, &gt;&gt; let me while while we are here, look at this. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The one who came and he was in the synagogue. The Bible says &gt;&gt; now we read again &gt;&gt; Luke 3 verse 1-2 Luke 31 Hallelujah &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now in the 15th year of the reign of Tibarius Caesar, Pontius Pilate being the governor of Judea and Herod being the tetra the tetrarch of Galilee and his brother Philip tetra of it Italia and of the region of Traonitis and Lisania the tetra of Abileneas and Caiaphas being the high priests. The word of God came unto John the son of Zakarias in the wilderness. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; In those days when this one was that and that one was this and that one was the high priest. The word of God. I passed all of them. Amen. They look down to him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I understand chicken and what what else? fighting with a stick chasing sometimes with a blue eyeen. Hallelujah. with just like sheep skin. &gt;&gt; Never had a suit like me or what else? &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; And he was there looking around. You were supposed to uh pinpoint him. He was a foreigner between the Old Testament and the New Testament. &gt;&gt; He was there like an eagle to recognize him standing there looking this way, looking that way. And the next thing he said he saw Jesus coming the job. Now you see &gt;&gt; the word of God. That's why in our sophisticated age, scientific age. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Where we have the cream. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; In our day, when we have philosophers and great men, Hallelujah. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So the Bible says &gt;&gt; John &gt;&gt; s Jesus coming. The word came to Jordan. John saw him coming materialized. Jesus coming to John because the word don't just come to you through a tree or something before the can reach you must materialize. Amen. &gt;&gt; I will take you back again. &gt;&gt; Who came to know? You don't know who came to God bless you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; One day he was on his way to Damascus to arrest on his way. God made a road block. Amen. Yes, &gt;&gt; because &gt;&gt; that you know that is the mystery of predestination sitination. M. &gt;&gt; So he was coming &gt;&gt; talking about we must get rid of this Christian. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Then God stopped him. A light strike across. He stopped there. Then from there what did God say to him? Go to &gt;&gt; he will tell you &gt;&gt; because out of the contract God has people here you pray to Amen. &gt;&gt; That's the economy of God. So Paul, &gt;&gt; he was blind. I've done this part. Another part there will do the rest. Amen. So he was going to Anas's then told him what to do and what amen. &gt;&gt; What did heaven do about it? &gt;&gt; Philip was somewhere else. away. &gt;&gt; It's emergency go down. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Somebody on a chariot. &gt;&gt; So, Philip just appeared there. Hello sir. Yes sir. I'm struggling here. I'm reading about somebody here. &gt;&gt; Who is this man? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know these people they never just read the Bible. While reading there was something in them. &gt;&gt; Who is this man? Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Then Philip &gt;&gt; interpreted to him that this word was made flesh. He dwelt among us. And the man was baptized right away. He had just vanished. The answer to that man was &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now in closing, &gt;&gt; let's we won't finish but we'll close. &gt;&gt; All right. Now we are still there. In the beginning was the word and we see now the attributes became words &gt;&gt; and they became persons. And this people when that word is made flesh and they was a man. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why recognize him. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because you can't see him from your mind. &gt;&gt; There was now a correspondence between him and Peter. They look beyond the human flesh see that this is him. &gt;&gt; Now I read maybe you say you read this even before hold your peace and listen to the word of God. Even if you are sick you know divine healing. If you come in here and you are sick, just accept the will of God. by Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So you take the word of God and all other things will will take their places.
