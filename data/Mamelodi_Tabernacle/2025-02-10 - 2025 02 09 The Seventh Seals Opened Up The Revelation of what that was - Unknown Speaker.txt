go back we have [Music] citizens everywhere you go you will find citizens but is a special citizens before the foundation of the world they were supernaturally registered as the Sons and Daughters of they do not s why because they are the children of now the revelation of what that was it has passed already so we are looking forward let me read you something here it says we are entering into that real eternity are you there where the church is called not to some station not to some denomination but into eternity have you ever tasted eternity amen amen eternity now I read the church is called not to some station it's nonstop until they are in eternity that's why today we have the revelation of what that was [Music] amen you can never wish or long to go to heaven if you were not there before amen because it is going back you know we are not struggling maybe to gain strength or to apply no we are citizens a citizen [Music] strugg and that's why we are on our way back all right amen now I read it it's all revealed in there and the Seven Seals open up the revelation of what that [Applause] was what makes you to long for God to long to for heaven amen amen I'm reading it here for you the seven seal open up the revelation of what that was if you can catch up with the revelation of what that wasall you will quit things amen amen and worship God on your way back home that's how God is wor we are forness amen amen yeah God is worshiped by the foreigners with longing seen them you know sometimes you find yourself praying saying Lord Jesus when are you coming for me all right amen now I read I will leave it there the revelation of what what was there there what are you longing for what have you seen what have you enjoyed that's that that has put so much longing in [Music] you wanting to leave the world with its things to go back possibly you have seen something wonderful that's why it says it is the revelation of what that was now as a child of God you have a revelation of something back amen amen now it's wonderful amen uh I will read some few things here even yesterday you know always when praying I find myself saying Come and catch me home amen amen that's why that's why I love this song Heaven is my home where I'm going to rest I was traveling somewhere inang or what the brothers in the car I started singing and I started singing he's always there he's always there then sister said to meor sing then I said sorry what is Rebecca saying she says Rebecca says he is always there means he's talking about God then I said and what do you say I also say he always he's always there I said can you now hear that this is not Rebecca it doesn't say Rebecca is always therea was just praising God that he is always there we sing so many songs but but we don't know the authors as long it says God is always there I also say he is always there when it says Heaven is my home where I will rest I also say heaven is my home the one who composed the song cannot outshine me he was composing it for me heaven is my home all right amen so now let's look at this future home I have a book future home oh future home amen amen amen are knowing that we have a home amen I will read something here brother just read this part here amen see eight cannot be counted with the week see it cannot be counted eight days in a week you can't do it see is this this part eight cannot be counted with the we that's right amen now amen it's telling us about seven seven but do you see it properly yes then you go no I I mean this one yes it's eight cannot be counted with the weak all right amen amen sorry somebody has done something here okay okay now let's look at this we are entering into that genuine eternity you know entering into eternity there is that pool that that's pulling you When you pray when you sing there's something in you pulling you into do you know what ET Maybe the whole day if we can stay here the whole day you'll realize at the end of the meeting that we are tired dragging our legs but here I'm talking about eternity and how many would love to find themselves there amen God is the king the Lord Jesus is the king I'm coming to read to you the part that says he is now a king Abraham when he was on Journey amen Amen on his way to the city the Bible says he met that king king of Sal so before you can arrive there you need to meet the king first without meeting the king it will be impossible to enter that City and I'm so glad the bride of Christ is in the form of that City you know you'll see the pyramid that the bread of Christ she is shaped in the form of a pyram and even the steps seven steps are in the pyam I've been reading about that seven steps in the pyramid then the prophet of God says the throne is seen from within Pam why the people are saying the seventh seal is not revealed it is because I will read when we come it is in the pyramid you know the first pyramid uh was of En Enoch amen there seven from Adam the second pyramid it is the prophet the seventh from Paul so seven s okay amen now I read here the pyramid pyramid and uh you know that one of Enoch back there it was not a municip it belonged to Enoch the S man from yeah it should be the seventh we'll bring it here we'll flush it and then well you all know it is the seventh but it says also the bright is shaped like a pyam amen that's what you say seven Church okay but I read before I close uh it says and we live through all these types repat here but when you hit the eight you go into amen amen now you can count your steps as you are walking worshiping because every day uh as you are walking you are going somewhere but while working you go around picking some things sometimes building a house and so on your way to the city oh amen where you will spend eternity amen that's why it says even come that in some places is because it sound as if these Christians are calling him to come quickly while they are not ready for amen amen amen uh here I come we are entering now let me say to you the word of God comes in this manner if I read this thing we entering amen it's not just it's not a syllabus I'm saying we are entering I was listening to the prime minister of is saying this is the rupture I have heard some saying what is this here 1925 2025 amen we are almost there amen now one no one must take you back we are entering into that real genuine eternity you know entering that means the ministry now amen amen it's kind of a Ministry when you started off back there it was a Ministry uh not like the minister today because today's Ministry say come Lord Jesus we are entering into that real genuine where the church is called not to some station no stopping Place one way to the cityu am the citizens will say amen amen there's no stopping we are on the journey amen amen the citizens of Sal where the church is called not to some station some denomination but into [Music] eternity the ministry here is taking you into eternity that's why we don't move from church to church because we are a pilgrim amen am and you know a Christian is somebody who knows where he is going where he came from amen a Christian are you listening knows who he is is and she knows where is she from on her way to nonstop that's a real Christian until I reach my home until I reach my home I never [Music] from amen but into eternity with their Eternal King have you ever um thought of this that you will one day sit with Jesus is that in your heart am amen you will no no longer say come come Lord Jesus no now he come come come but after you are taken to meet him in the clouds up there one of these days Let Me Maybe say something you know some people I'm listening to they are saying this year what is this year2 one you know is when I was planning to to build a house as we are you see as here we are building amen but we are building somewhere amen if you see a Christian honest Christian amen am every day see the house of the Lord he's building something amen amen he or she knows that one day you fly away out of this world through the dimensions Dimension amen how will it [Applause] be do you have a thought that you will you will hold Jesus by hand amen have you ever thought of that do you think of that okay amen you don't mean amen amen I'm full of this kind of thoughts meeting Jesus face to face amen amen that's why ask oh it says here yeah now listen carefully when I finish here I'm going to sayen come and go with me [Music] also my home that's where I am going to rest hey you know my Prophet told me something he says when you are there you travel like in a thought if you want to be there you're already there amen I can can repeat this that while I'm standing here I can see my house otherwise I will get lost after the service but somebody else don't see my house I see it we see heaven but somebody else don't see Heaven you get that amen when I start off here after the service I will just go straight to my house because it is registered in me I want ask for a direction uhhuh my house is in me Heaven is in me amen amen you can't go to something amen that is not inside of you Heaven first enter you amen amen okay amen I'm I'm glad because it says twinkling of an eye amen it's not in twinkling of an eye you will be taken some are saying hey this is going to cause a lot of Chaos people just flying like that the plans of God are not the plans of men can you think that when he talks about Rapture Rapture Rapture just that is not my God there will not be any accident you are not going to crash onto something amen amen you just come out and you found find yourself with it amen amen no introduction because you know him amen all right let me read something before we close uh I'm here you know the church is called uh sometimes we believe that church is that building there where you go sometimes and all that no sometimes they even fight for money in there but eternity is where the church the church is called there amen amen not to some [Music] station okay amen you have passed into eternity amen right now because it says he that is born by God what happens to him sin why how because he is born of God an eternal birth am he you are born in order to inherit eternity amen I'm trying to encourage you let not the things of the world hold you back when Abraham ab and the citizens of Salem were on their way they met the king brother amen you know every day when walking talking I'm looking where I'm going to meet with this King now now at this point in time already I have made the king you have made the key but still we are on our way you know even there some places if you are looking for a house there they say you must first go to the chief the king amen yeah amen let me finish you have passed uh into eternity now eternity something say the day maybe the day I sleep I start saying oh how no you have passed and passed into eternity where you come from I Love This amen amen you are not going to say oh what's your you know if you turn this way no you have passed already into [Music] you yeah who was there [Music] tell me that the word is lying you was there to begin with and was born here to be tested and so forth amen amen and you were found to be an eternal being and eternal being no time amen that is eternal amen they were telling me that one is both both are not destinated because a a Christian marries he does not run around amen amen somebody who runs around is not a Christian he is a church that's all there you are amen eternity where you all where you was all the time where you was all the time but you have just recognized you have recognized that you are not of this world amen amen you were made for an eternal [Music] purpose a person with eternal life does not run around he marries young men listen a young man who has eternal life does not run with this girl that girl that you are a sinner if you do that a Christian don't do such things no hallah see you were made for an eternal purose praise [Music] God because you was the manifestation of an attribute that was in God praise God you come from God you go back to God amen am amen it says amen you and expressed in you I want to finish here now Ephesians 1: 10 it's called now if you are putting oh my I don't know all right but let me it's called the fullness of time and when the fullness of time has come that's when time has been fulfilled when there is no more time are you listening when where where you go into eternity after the seventh Church age is over and it is the seven church is finished are you there the seventh Church age is over amen that's why you see people are fighting one another changing from this church to that church amen amen but the person who has eternity amen amen let me read no more time you go to ET uh I want you to I I want this one to sing after the church seventh Church age is [Music] over you do not worship in the seventh Church you worshiping Christ Christ is not the seventh one is eternal and then he says it is you believe it amen amen okay seven Church age is finished am now what else now it says what say Luther's Church age is over Methodist Church age is [Music] over all right where are we Pentecostal AG [Music] age that's when it is here on Earth but everything that was born here has but a short time the church was not born here no because because if is born here on Earth and then on Earth we count him by ages so now if you go to church here on Earth know that it's going to come to an end it gets over amen fly machine when you go onto a a fly flight they don't say come in we'll see if it can manage to to fly amen no it has been tested it fli they don't say we see we'll just see if it can M yes one sister was asking me it was early in the morning early in the morning she says to me brother brother now because the Rapture is coming everywhere they're talking about it now she says now what plan are you making for us no no no I have no plan God has already made a plan now she says father father they say father meaning the devil he must call Him Father not not the devil oh he says a father has made a plan for us I said what kind big jet he's building a very big that when the Rapture comes they go into this big Chet he actually means when the children of God have been raptured
