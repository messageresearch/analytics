TRANSCRIPT
========================================
[Music] Now, let's turn to our Bibles. John 14 John 14. Um verse 20 &gt;&gt; 20 more verse 20. &gt;&gt; I am in my father and at that day you shall know that I am in my father and you in me and I in you. Revelation chapter 3 verse 20- 21 or rather 22. &gt;&gt; Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If any man hear my voice and open the door, I will come into him and will s with him and he with me. To him who that overcomes will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame and am sat down with my father in his throne. Let us pray. Again, we come in this house for to worship the almighty God who created heaven and earth and who has chosen us before the foundation of the world so that we should be who we are. This morning &gt;&gt; we are praying believing that you are in our midst and also in us as you have promised that in the last days you'll come into us and uh we are believing that you'll heal every uh sick person in this house uh both physically and spiritually emotionally. And so we as we pray, we believe that you are here to deliver again the word uh to us in this end time in Jesus Christ's name. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You may be seated for a while, the Lord willing, and now this morning I just want uh to pose for a photo with Christ. I want us to talk about being identified with Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And uh a brother just happened to uh give me this portion of the word when he asked a question but sincerely. So he said to me, "Who is this man who has put your face in the cloud?" But the brother was asking this in a very good mood. And I said to him, "Maybe I would not know, but what I believe that is his photo. something [Music] must have prompted him to uh put my face in that cloud. Now that is his photo. Amen. Amen. And uh and I said to the brother, uh I I believe that if I we can see Christ this to to Jesus this morning, everybody would want to pose a photo with him. Amen. Amen. I I believe it. So I believe for posing for a photo with Christ is a desire in every believer's heart. [Music] Now let's let's start now. Now now the subject here is being identified with Christ. Amen. Now I go to Congo and elsewhere. The brothers know [Music] last time we were in Cameroon in Congo, I I tried to run away from the brothers and sisters. They all want to pose for a photo with me just to identify themselves. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; You know, if um if somebody comes to this place &gt;&gt; and then maybe he's from somewhere else, I think all of us would want to post uh I mean to take a photo with him just in order to be identified. Amen. &gt;&gt; With him. &gt;&gt; Okay. Now, now I will read some something before the the brother is just working on a a small um diagram here. Now, you know, here we we've got some books. Now, the first man who actually had a desire to uh take a photo was God. Amen. Now as we say at that day you shall know that I am in you. That means I will identify myself and express myself in you. Amen. Go &gt;&gt; God likes that. He creates a thing and post for a photo with it. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; He wants to be identified with his creation. That's why the Bible says he is the all and in all. Amen. He is identified with all. [Music] Now I read where the prophet says when Jesus was born the first people to receive the message were his subjects. That means the other people they receive the announcement from their subjects. Now the subject is the one who has the first information because he is part of the whole picture. That's why the Bible says in the book of Psalms and the seed shall serve him and shall declare to this generation he has done this only the seed and uh so now and and now the Bible again Galatians chapter 3 says &gt;&gt; uh Abraham's seed Abraham is Christ. Amen. Now, &gt;&gt; now we will read it. &gt;&gt; And now, that's why this morning I've been hearing people uh talking about it. Now, this time, now they've put face in the cloud. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's a a a a global outcry. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; About what's wrong with because he's just a human being. A sinner. A a a sinner saved by grace. &gt;&gt; Saved by grace. I know. Amen. Amen. But now let's first here um now let's put the whole thing in a a center point and look at a man because the Bible says what is man [Applause] what is man now the first person &gt;&gt; to announce Uh this poor man like me was God himself. &gt;&gt; No, not the church, not who? Somebody else, but was now you must always make sure that [Music] you you what you the your identity is with God. So then you don't mind the other things coming from the circum coming by circumstances because you must be able to identify yourself with with God. Amen. Now this morning I want us to take a photo &gt;&gt; in the cloud. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now I'll show you how you pose for a photo with that cloud. Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now you ask the people the Bible says he was taken up in a cloud. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the message believers believe that that cloud was the the souls the the people who had gone before. [Music] Amen. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. You say to them, &gt;&gt; uh, what was this cloud? &gt;&gt; Because we have some readers. &gt;&gt; Now, they don't believe a thing unless they can read. They can read it. They believe the reading. But then the Bible says in the end time God will reveal &gt;&gt; the mysteries hid throughout the the the ages. Now that that thing is not something that you can read is the revelation of the word. [Music] Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus says Who do men say that I, the son of man, am? Did Peter read? No, he couldn't read that. And yet, it's a question posed to him. He posted that question to the disciples. Amen. Amen. H Now, Peter and them, they they couldn't read that. until Peter uttered this words, &gt;&gt; thou art the Christ. Amen, &gt;&gt; son of the living God. &gt;&gt; Now, if you have a revelation, he didn't say thou, thou art Jesus, &gt;&gt; because it is Jesus asking a question. [Applause] Now the the answer can't be thou art Jesus. &gt;&gt; If brother asked me a question, &gt;&gt; who do you men say that I am? The answer is not because it's asking the question. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now men like the people of today uh some say you are Jeremiah, some say you are this. Some say we dealing with him. make yourself. &gt;&gt; Some say some say you know but then he wanted to know who who then he turned to them who then do you say that I am. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now who do men say I am? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And who do you say that Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; A prophet is not a prophet to the whole world. He's a prophet to a certain class of people. &gt;&gt; A pastor is not the pastor of all the the churches. He is a pastor to a certain class. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the Lord Jesus said, "If they believe you, Amen. Amen." Now, let's read here. Now, God said in Genesis 1 verse 26, Genesis 126, &gt;&gt; "Let us make men in our image. You see &gt;&gt; and uh so he was starting to identify himself. &gt;&gt; Let us make men in our image. Meaning that I want to see myself. Amen. &gt;&gt; How I look like. Amen. &gt;&gt; So now uh in seeing myself I should have somebody my resemblance &gt;&gt; so that I I won't have a problem looking at myself if you have a mirror. What does that mean? Because without a mirror you can't clearly see yourself. If you WANT TO SEE but with a mirror you you you see the people in the morning after dressing up they come before the mirror. Amen. Amen. Doing this &gt;&gt; because you can't see your face now. You must have an image. so that you can see how you look like. Now God also was the first one to be wanting to identify himself and see himself on a mirror now and his mirror is not like our mirror. His mirror should be a living mirror. Amen. &gt;&gt; So that this mirror can talk. [Music] &gt;&gt; This mirror can talk back to him so that he can also know how he speaks. Amen. Amen. Amen. You know your your man-made mirror can't walk, can't talk. So you you you don't know your voice. You can &gt;&gt; you don't hear yourself. &gt;&gt; It can speak. But God's mirror, God's image, it's like him. Amen. Amen. Now by that mirror, he can even send that mirror. Amen. &gt;&gt; To stand in his place. &gt;&gt; And he says, "If they hear you, they hear me." Amen. Amen. And they see you, they see me. Amen. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, let's see. Now that's God's mirror, &gt;&gt; his image. Even this morning, you are here to look at God's image. [Applause] The image that can stand for God. [Music] Amen. &gt;&gt; Not for a church, &gt;&gt; not for a group. [Applause] Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What we need this morning &gt;&gt; um is God's image &gt;&gt; so that we can be able to identify ourselves. I I will read you something here. If I've got the book, I I will read it to you. You know this is what we need this morning men. Forgive me here. &gt;&gt; I must look for for my page here. &gt;&gt; It's somewhere else around here which I I would like to read to you. So just before we can pose for a photo. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Those who want to be identified Yeah, you know the book a the mighty God unveiled before us. &gt;&gt; The mighty God unveiled before us. &gt;&gt; That that is something else again. &gt;&gt; The mighty God unveiled. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Before not before the world, before us. Amen. Jesus appeared to some others and not to some others. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Here we are. &gt;&gt; Page 26. The mighty God unveiled before us. Amen. Um to be a Christian I must stay identified where the word of God is being manifested. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The mighty God unveiled before us page 26 paragraph 202. &gt;&gt; Paragraph 202. Amen. H maybe let me read it again so that now to be a Christian now a Christian &gt;&gt; it's a God God's indwelled being amen now it doesn't say to be a believer but to be a Christian okay Because the word believe &gt;&gt; can mean like this. &gt;&gt; Let me let me read it to you again. You listen. The word believer what it really means. Okay. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You where's that book? I I will read it to you. &gt;&gt; Um John chapter 8 verse 30. As he spoke these words, many believed on him. You see, now this doesn't mean faith. It's a believe like the people would say, you know, I believe when he says this, this, but when it comes to this, I don't take it. So that's a belief. That's not faith. You believe a certain statement and reject the next one. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Now listen here that is John 8 29 verse 30. As he spoke these words h many believed on him. So they believe the words. &gt;&gt; Now God is &gt;&gt; the word but you can believe the words. Amen &gt;&gt; and still disbelieve the word. Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. Amen. you can believe some of the things I'm going to to speak about and reject the others. Now, that's five senses. That's not faith. Faith takes the word. Amen. Okay. Amen. Some of the people here when it comes to underworld and the things &gt;&gt; they say I say no here we don't agree with the pastoral how how can human being be &gt;&gt; if you don't know a thing just keep quiet amen Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; If you say this is not this, &gt;&gt; then you must be able to give us the answer. &gt;&gt; If you can't give the answer, &gt;&gt; then you know nothing. &gt;&gt; Okay. Amen. Then verse 31, &gt;&gt; then Jesus said to those Jews who believed on him, If you continue in my word now he didn't now he doesn't say in my words. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Then are you my disciples indeed? If you continue not in my words but in my word because the way God is the way. [Music] Amen. &gt;&gt; Not the words. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Verse 32. &gt;&gt; Verse 32. &gt;&gt; And you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free. But he means if you continue in my word then are you my disciples. That means his disciples are not those who believe the words. But are are those who continue in in God? [Music] &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because the words is not a complete thing. But the word &gt;&gt; is complete. Amen. &gt;&gt; In the beginning was not the words but the word and the word was God. [Music] Amen. &gt;&gt; It never said words. &gt;&gt; Now verse 32. And you if you continue in my word, you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free. &gt;&gt; The people who believed the words were not yet free. Even today there's some people who believed the words. They tell you the word but they don't believe the word because every time you identify yourself with God then there's an outcry. They believe in talking about the words the words the words the words But they don't believe the word. &gt;&gt; I'll show you here in the Bible. &gt;&gt; Now here, here you are. Listen now. &gt;&gt; Now h and if you shall know the truth only if you continue and the truth shall make you free. Then answer they answered him we are Abraham's seed &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; meaningh uh you must know that you are talking to Abraham seed Amen don't just take us us for granted &gt;&gt; yeah Amen. &gt;&gt; Must know that we are the message believers. &gt;&gt; We've got the spoken word spoken word. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Be careful when you speaking to us. &gt;&gt; And we are never in bondage to any man. Yeah. We not under any man. Amen. How sayest thou you shall be made free? We are saved. We have received. How do you mean is free? Because we are free already. [Music] You are free in the denomination. Out of denominations, we are free. You be careful when you talking to. &gt;&gt; Then Jesus answered them, "Verily, verily, I say unto you, whosoever committed sin is the servant of sin." Sin of unbelief. Amen. Amen. Amen. Believing unbelievers. Amen. The thing is they want Jesus to speak to them the words but they they don't want himself to identify himself as the word. Amen. As knowing something, you know, they don't they just want him to preach about God. God is this. God God can do this. God, but they don't want him to take a picture with that God. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; They don't want him to identify himself. Because that is the thing that e kindled anger in them. &gt;&gt; You are a man. &gt;&gt; You see, that that was their problem. You are a man. Now Jesus would always come and identify himself with GOD and say the father is in me. I am they said no no no no just speak the word. Don't identify yourself. The people today want you to talk about the prophet but they don't want you to identify yourself with the prophet. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They don't want that. &gt;&gt; H you know the people they they think God is like the a king of Rwanda or somewhere else. You know, you've never seen Jesus &gt;&gt; in Jerusalem &gt;&gt; been driven around in a a a bulletproof carproofh disciples were not bodyguards. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A king today to see him You have to be somewhere elsewhere &gt;&gt; because he's surrounded by bodyguards. &gt;&gt; The bulletproof what and else bulletproof &gt;&gt; but not Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't mistake the the disciples to be bodyguards. &gt;&gt; No. So this Jesus of mine, &gt;&gt; he he was just he was a man of men. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; He walked among the people, embraced children, and embraced the people. H visited the poor. He visited the sick. Amen. He was an ordinary citizen among the people [Music] but with a extraordinary life. All right. This is the Jesus I know. It's a man you could meet and sit down with him and talk to him. You could you could ask him questions. Today if you come close to the king your security will you won't be allowed to shake his hand. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Why? Because of security. So now this Jesus of mine &gt;&gt; is not a king &gt;&gt; uh who sat on a throne with people creating fresh air. I mean what we're doing feing him. No no that's not my Jesus. &gt;&gt; My Jesus was a man. &gt;&gt; Amen. Sometimes he got hungry and in the process as they were coming and bankrupt. So he even cast a fig tree for failing to produce feed because he was hungry. That that is the Jesus I know. Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not that he was not walking around with oil and water selling to the people selling to the people. &gt;&gt; No, no, no. That's not the one I know. The one I know is the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, in order to identify himself with me, He became me. Amen. That &gt;&gt; that's how God can identify himself. He became a man. Amen. And also he felt the infirmities. He got hungry and thirsty like me. Amen. Sometimes he was bankrupt like me because he post a photo with me. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; He posed for a photo with He wanted to be a man. &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. In order to be identified, [Music]
