Description:
This message was preached by pastor Israel Nkodima on 26 December 2016 at The Final voice tabernacle in Kempton Park South Africa

The purpose of this sermon was to show the audience about the translation of the bride of Christ. The Pastor read Revelation 22:6 “And he said unto me, These sayings are faithful and true: and the Lord God of the holy prophets sent his angel to shew unto his servants the things which must shortly be done.”
‭‭
He further reads Genesis‬ ‭18‬:‭9‬-‭15‬“And they said unto him, Where is Sarah thy wife? And he said, Behold, in the tent. And he said, I will certainly return unto thee according to the time of life; and, lo, Sarah thy wife shall have a son. And Sarah heard it in the tent door, which was behind him. Now Abraham and Sarah were old and well stricken in age; and it ceased to be with Sarah after the manner of women. Therefore Sarah laughed within herself, saying, After I am waxed old shall I have pleasure, my Lord being old also? And the Lord said unto Abraham, Wherefore did Sarah laugh, saying, Shall I of a surety bear a child, which am old? Is any thing too hard for the Lord? At the time appointed I will return unto thee, according to the time of life, and Sarah shall have a son. Then Sarah denied, saying, I laughed not; for she was afraid. And he said, Nay; but thou didst laugh.”

He also read Genesis‬ ‭21‬:‭1‬-‭2‬ ‭KJV‬‬ “And the Lord visited Sarah as he had said, and the Lord did unto Sarah as he had spoken. For Sarah conceived, and bare Abraham a son in his old age, at the set time of which God had spoken to him.”

TRANSCRIPT
========================================
foreign [Music] now if you are not predestinated you start to or tomorrow but you can't do that to a son of God because I will tell you straight that because yeah used to call them and then it is Park light they don't go further they end up with pretty teeth [Music] [Applause] you see you must take the whole thing from the prophet not a part of it write it what you need to get attracted to pull him to the next verse now comes the Son of God because he is that word he will read the whole chapter he is since I saw them they packed today but he is in his people and we can see his glory see the glory of the servants to his people because the enemy was not supposed to hear or see anything so that Satan could not pick down anything foreign ah let's look give me one second let me go back again Adam was here on Earth brother Brendan says he was the other part of the contract when he was here God moved things in heaven he brought them to Adam having said nothing the Earthly [Music] so the god of the earth contract with the god of the universe I mean so when it comes down now you well when you want to know the secrets hey you have to wait by the sight of Adam doing that every secret that is in in heaven this man will reveal it silence you don't have a revelation that is flying in the air foreign foreign [Music] oh man can I spend 15 minutes amen listen so potentially potential is in here and what it is lucky the word promised before the foundation of the world and around there this only reflects the negative yeah all winterfella negative this body that will reflect the positive well the whole ones are positive and the same thing you're not true or the translation of the Bride will be the same thing listen now tillage the word this is how it comes the word that's in you know the materialize around that word [Applause] in heaven and the same thing did by Sarah now here we are talking about an inside job materialize [Music] I mean a man and this body cannot do it so it will have to be changed [Applause] let me read the Bible and the Bible will tell us the true story while we are here turn also to your book Hebrews Hebrews chapter 11 chapter 11 verse 11. amen chapter 11 verse 11 by Hebrew chapter 11 verse 11 he who has it and reading English through Sarah also sorry true Faith also Sarah herself received strength to conceive seed and was delivered of a child when she was past age because she judged him faithful who had promised amen okay amen although I read this yesterday we'll say this again how it was channeled because if you read verse and what Hebrew what does verses 8 verse 8. by faith Abraham when he was called to go out into a place which he should after receive for an inheritance obeyed and he went out not knowing whether he went okay amen now we headed yesterday Pastor a bit of it says by faith Abraham Eric Eric verse 11 says [Music] now this time is Not By Faith because the faith is that of Abraham and the wife it says yes this is not a woman he called Abraham my Lord through faith of Abraham showing that Elijah operated through the faith of Abraham [Applause] but with Abraham by faith I mean with us the bride right is through the face of the Lord Jesus Christ amen the Bible says we operate through his face okay amen I will pass that because now God is going to bring seed in Isaac shall the seed be called all right now we're trying to put it together Joseph was not mentioned Joseph to excuse him foreign and became blood yeah somebody will believe it when that word fell into Layla by Gabriel yeah when it was given to a vision yes and said be and be it unto me according oh yeah what it means she's she firstly she thought I how can I have a baby amen but when the inside the Revelation started to build up then she corrected herself be it unto me amen amen not according to my understanding not according to my knowledge because I will depends on the way that you have spoken if the seven seal is open and he said nothing when he said that when she said it has been planted amen and Gabriel turned well around the will of God has been done the seed has been planted the sun will come forth now and Sarah started to feel things amen amen he used to go to collect water with some other women but you still wondering how come the Lord come to me I mean so it was building up a body for God and when that child was born he distanced himself from any other it would be parents foreign [Applause] and verse 11 now Abraham no I I quoted that one Hebrews it cease to be no verse 11. true Faith also Sarah herself received strength to conceive seed and was delivered of a child when she was past age amen amen when she was when she was when it was impossible for a woman foreign as we have passed amen amen when she passed age the operation was now God fulfilling his way I'm in so that giving Sarah or lesser could not boasts now as you go to chapter 18 of Genesis [Music] now Abraham and Sarah were old and well-stricken in age and it ceased to be with Sarah after the men of women amen amen are you with us it seized to be with sir she was beyond that okay [Music] an old woman manner of women she was sort of just waiting for the whisker while images so that she can go to rest what are you good but at that time there was a visitation amen God wants you when you are at your last [Applause] days amen God comes when the dog the doctor said you won't leave amen he likes that Gap in order to come and jump in and say I am the life just to remain a physician to remind a physician that the life it's me the doctor sentenced you to death he comes in yeah yeah when Lazarus was dead he came in he laughed that he came after he was dead [Applause] to display his powers when Lazarus is alive and also to display his power look like he said to Martha I am the resurrection so he wanted to a situation is the resurrection I mean now he could not share the resurrection with death that's why he came with Lazarus the spirit Lazarus Lazarus he came to the tomb of Lazarus which is the remains part of the family but Lazarus was in him [Applause] amen [Applause] he oh he just reconnected the thing we are not connected foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] 21. he he for he said oh my let me run it here verse 9 of Genesis 18 says 18 and they said unto him where is and he said behold in the attention now listen to the second one and he said verse 9 says they said foreign [Music] early in the morning a place where he stood before the Lord and he looked to us the land of the plane and behind the Lord the smoke of the country went up as the smoke uh of a furnace maybe you didn't hear it verse chapter 18 chapter 18 verse 20. and the Lord said because The Cry of Sodom and Gomorrah is great and because their sin is very Grievous I will go down now and see whether they have done all together according to the Cry of it which is come unto me and if not I will know and they maintain their faces amen amen that was the third pool says that was the third pool in the house of Abraham Brothers came to the house of Abraham the seventh seals came to the house of Abraham now watch Abraham Abraham stood yet his ministry comes up to that yeah then the Bible says the next morning he came back to the same place can go back to where I stood with the Lord I'll be able to see amen so when he came there next morning especially knowing what was going to happen he stood at the same place good job amen did you know that after the Rapture camera we will stand somewhere when we will see things that comes after amen we will see what what will take place amen [Music] amen [Applause] I'm so glad I'm one of them amen somewhere with the Lord yeah we will look down these things for he said I shall not hide from Abraham but what I want to you to look at secretary verse chapter 21 Genesis chapter 21 release hold on for a while and the Lord visited Sarah as he has said I mean I mean now here he doesn't speak of Abraham it's just he said I shall return I will return the ministry went to Sarah now concentration amen did you ever went to attend a wedding alone I mean the concentration is always on the bride yeah I mean the man you can put the best suit or watch against the people don't care about them they say oh look at that dress the concentration is on the female now here we see God himself concentrating on the woman amen because a man cannot conceive so I mean it should come from the Menace their whole concentrations are you listening friends and if she's become so important even if she comes in today because they can see that she's very important it's two people in one okay so they always say it's sorry for Mama their concentration is now on the bride that's why even today the concentration is the manifestation of the seed where they preached by the prophet Amish brother Brendan says Jesus just believed in what the way they say amen he is you too I lose amen amen amen and when they come to join like I would just say who are you he said I am the voice [Music] he manifested Isaiah 44 foreign [Applause] we cannot preach Who We Are and Jesus preached who he is amen amen I'm trying to drive you to a place you should be changed amen and yes yours your body is old outside [Applause] cannot see the seventh seals which should be a changed amen amen actually to say he's a new person is not to say he started there is because he was newly introduced he's been there before but as he was now introduced in this time he is Sarah in his mission that means if you look at him at the same time of which God had spoken amen amen and even there's something again when Abraham died how old was he I'm trying to read it here we'll find it find it for me when Abraham died how old was he you don't know because you didn't attend the funeral chapter 25 verse seven follow it chapter 25 verse 7 and these are the days of the years of Abraham's life which he lived in in 103 score and 15 years then Abraham died in a good old age an old man full of years and yet after God has changed him I mean so there was something another person in abrahamas still bring children but yet when they look at him he was still old when the people look at you you are still aging [Applause] I mean I mean the Lord has to change you first amen [Applause] amen amen because people care about you we would suggest to look for a young man didn't they say he has changed this one is still old [Applause] [Music] a cloud [Music] old men cannot see that [Applause] because an old man can see far you get what I
