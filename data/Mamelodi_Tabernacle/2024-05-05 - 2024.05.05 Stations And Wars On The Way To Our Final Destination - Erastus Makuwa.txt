Description:
Title: Stations and wars on the way to our final destination.
Preached By Pastor Erastus Makuwa at Mamelodi Tabernacle on Sunday 05 May  2024 at Mamelodi Tabernacle.

The Pastor read the following scriptures:
Revelation 21: 1-4   Revelation 19: 11-21; Revelation 16:13-16; Hebrews 12:22-23; Revelation 4:5

The purpose of the sermon was to show the audience about the Stations and the wars on our way to the final destination.

Before each and every Station there will be war. 
When the messenger receives the sword it shows that we are at the  Gate. There is a ministry before the gate and after the gate.  Now we are in the ministry after the gate. After Adam and Eve where moved out from the garden of Eden , God had to make a plan to bring them back again in the garden of Eden, in his plan he had to restore Adam first and he restored Adam. 
The restored Adam was Christ and second Eve was taken out of Adam. 

The book was given to the 7th Angel messenger.He received the book in a form of the sword. He was given the book to reveal it to us. The sword is leading us towards the tree of life today.  He received the Word in a form of the sword. He marched with the sword towards the 3rd pull. We are moving away from the gate towards our destination, which is the city that Abraham saw. 

To be a child of God is a predestination. Abraham was predestinated to be the child of God. Abraham was looking for the God of Noah and he met the God of Noah. God showed Abraham the city which is the destination of the Bride. The new Jerusalem is the city that he saw. The maker of that city is God. 

The church that will pass the gate must be in a form of a pyramid. The Church is the church of the first born. The first born is a blessing. 

Our first station on our way to the final destination is the marriage supper, there is a war/battle before the first station which is Gog and Magog . The second station is Millennium. Each age has its own war. 
The battle started in heaven and it was brought ...

before the station before each station there will be a [Music] war um we are on our way remotely when we reach the seven Church age our messenger said he received the sword in his hand when the messenger receives the S it showed that we are now at the gate there was a Ministry before the gate and there is a Ministry after the G then now we are in the ministry after the gate because they G there is where and Eve gone through when they were driven out of the Garden of Eden and God placed the Cherub there with the SW the way back to the tree of life then now it showed we have reached the gate again because after they were driven away God made a plan to bring them back again the Gard of Eden in his plan he had to restore Adam first and He restored we know how he restored until Christ came and Christ was the second he was the restored then he had to restore Eve because Eve was taken out of Adam then he had to put Adam in ad deep sleep at Calvary day then he took out of Adam through the blood the second Eve then to take out the second Eve he had to build through seven Church then when we reach the seventh one then we reach the end and when we reach the end then we the our Prophet the seventh angel messenger received because that was the way towards the game then when we reach there but because that when we reached there the book was taken because our names were there and when the book was taken then the lamp broke the sa because he took the book from the hand of the one who sat on the throne and that book was the book of redemption when he had taken the book then he opened the SE then he took the book and gave it to the seventh angel when the seventh angel messenger received the he received the book in a form of a sword then he received the sword it was the book in the form of a s he was given that book to reveal that book to us why he received the the first the SW was burning the people from getting the tree of [Music] life but now in our day the S is leading us towards the tree of life that is why the prophet says in this book here after receiving the sword in the book why Christ speak the word he said go give me more courage after receiving the to take that s of the way because they say he receiv The Sword in a form he received the we in the form of a sord he said God give me courage to take that s of the word that he put in my hand about years ago and hold it and Mar forward to that third pool is my prayer that is what the seventh angel messenger say after receiving the sword he marched with the sword towards the thir pool in fact the sword was given to us then it was the it was to show that the the second Eve is restored now the second if and the second Adam they are now on their way going back to the to to the to the toen again let me just perhaps go ding let me read something here this book Christ is the mystery of God revealed watch here is a is beautiful I don't want you to miss this now everybody you people on tape there he said but I want to something as it was in the days of no so shall it be in the coming of the son of man as in the days of lot when and Rob went down into Sodom to preach to them Sodom and blinded their eyes see with the gospel one Angel stayed back a messenger with Abraham and they elect the group and what kind of a sign did he do and what did Abraham call him Elohim what manifested in flesh Jesus showing that he himself God in him God in him will be manifested in his bride in the last days oh my just no end to it just a revelation of God is eternal life just keeps moving on and on and on is then one like the first Adam and Eve before sin separated them in death now now CHR the second in life redeems his bread from Death now on his way back to the original aen restoring beg his bride in Fellowship beg with God as husband and wife in the Garden of Eden sure Christ and his bride we are moving from the gate towards the our destination moving from the gate there and when we move from the gate there watch there will be stations before we reach our destination before we reach our home before we reach our city Abraham Abraham Abraham father was the worshiper of Idols th seeth jhua he told them you can choose whether you want to worship that God father or the god of the Amor in which land you dwell as me and my wife and my house we will worship the Lord Abraham's father as I was reading following his story I was told he was the he was making Idols selling them you see to be the child of God is predestination God knew that you will be his child Abraham was predestinated to be the child of while he was work working in his father's shop I was told there was a certain God he was the the he was thought to be the mightier one well Abraham father was not there Abraham broke one God's leg and when his father came back who has broken this Abraham said this one this one broke this [Music] one his father was perplexed you see because he he he won't say you are you are wrong that one cannot break the door because if you can say it will mean that these things are not [Music] God's then his brother has to throw him out of the shop but from there said to look for the god of no the prophet told me like that when Abraham was looking for the god of he found the god of then God of no SP appeared to Abraham and he spoke to Abraham and he showed Abraham the seat [Music] the city which is the bright destination the city which read about in the Bible the New Jerusalem Abraham was shown that City then Abraham he thought that that city is on Earth here he he went out looking for that the Bible told us that he was looking for the city whose architect and the finisher was he was moving from a country to Country until he made the king of that [Music] [Applause] City are you together with me truly are you ready this is the city that Abraham was looking for being a prophet he knew that the city was somewhere the Bible said so he forsook the city he lived he went over look where he went exactly where it will be see he was looking for the city whose Builder and maker was God being a prophet Jesus going to prepare with Divine hand a Divine City a Divine architect for a Divine bden people for a predestinated people is going to prepare that City blessed are you if you are the member of those people Abraham was looking for it he professed that he was a pilgrim and stranger for he looked for a city whose Builder and maker was God he thought he would reach that City it was just somewhere a c Builder and maker was God John saw it coming down Abraham thought it must be on the Earth right then he met madc the king of it he gave him a TI which had no father no mother he had no beginning of Life no ending of Life made him they took right on the literal spot where the city will be raised up the Holy Mountain of the Lord where he where the redeemed will live when he took the book and open the SE The Rock John says All Creatures help me [Applause] shouting the prophet said he might have looked beyond the K of time and so Jo and the book is is open and the seals are revealed that is the day of your Redemption that is where you were revealed that is where we we we we received a new [Music] ministry the ministry Beyond the Veil and the Miss which will be had by the people the inside people when God was building his church when God was building his tle Jesus said I'm going to build my tle and the Gates of Hell will never Prevail against when Jesus was building his church bu it in the form of that City read Hebrews my brother chapter 12 12 verse 22 223 verse verse 22 22 to 23 but ye come unto Mount Zion and unto the city of the Living God the heavenly Jerusalem and to an innumerable company of angels to the generals assembling and ch Church of the first born which are written in heaven and to God the judge of all and to the spirits of just men made perfect that is Paul addressing the Church of Hebrews he said you have come on the Mount Zion andto the SE city of the Living God Jesus said I'm going to build my [Applause] church Paul says to this ones you have arve the Heavenly Jerusalem the brightest the Heavenly when God was building it he he he started he buil as a pyramid because that city is is a pyramid like structure the church that will feed in the city it must be in a form of a pyramid when you getting that church you are getting on a mountain and an innumerable company of angels when Gaz was afraid seen the enemies [Music] coming Elijah said those who are with us are more than those the prophet said Elijah was quoting the scripture of D David said the angel of God the angels of God and come those who fear Him Elijah know as long as I am here and then I fear the lord the angels of Lord they are if you have that spirit if you have that Faith you always know those angels El knew didn't worry about the the enemies that's why they say here you have come to a an innumerable company of angels and to the general assembly and the Church of the firstborn which are written in heaven the first the first born the first born were blessed people in the Old Testament the first born was a blessed person if two women were married by one man waiting for the children if this one who is not loved if he can bear a firstborn he would jump she would jump and now I'll be respected this one will respect me because I got first I the blessing the first born was blessing in those [Music] days this why this church it's the Church of the [Applause] firstborn their names are written in heaven the prophet says their names are written in the section of the book of life in the section of the book they not just written with other people they are written in the section you have to look you have to look for them that section is called the LM it is called the book of Redemption where the redeemed are written in it hey I've gone out of my lecture my lecture is the way from the gate to our final and when we move from the we have called stations station and our first station is the mar this our first station and before we reach theic there is a w but that door is do it is not our war is the war between Russia and Israel it is called and that is our lecture on our way before we reach the first station there is a war there th say the Book of Ezekiel Ezekiel chter 36 we are not going to read it you must 38 and 39 38 and 39 you will read it there Russia Russia will fight with Israel but according to the prophecy Israel is going to conquer the batt amen the is not yet started but we know even even if they going to fight is is conquered the B will be on the mountain of Israel that is the battle the war on our way our first station when we pass our first station there is another War there because when we pass our first station then we go to Millennium this is our another station we go there when we go to that station when you ration chapter 19 vers 11 11 to 27 I believe my brother can read it for us ration verse 11 11 to 21 and I saw heaven opened and behold a white horse and he that set upon him was called faithful and true and in righteousness he do judge and make war his eyes were as a flame of fire and on his head were many crowns and he had an name written that no man knew but he himself and he was cloth with a vesture dipped in Blood and his name is called the word of God M and the armies which were in heaven followed him upon white horses grow in fine lean and white and clean just stop little I saw heaven open then I saw white horses there were people who were on those horses there were armies and they in each age we hear a phrase he that overcometh in other ways each age there is a war there but there are armies this battle started inen it was thrown down to the Earth those armies who are fighting there in heaven they were here on Earth fighting again if you are not with me there then we'll never be together because we have to fight I can't do you can't do otherwise it depends on which side you were there Satan is fighting he wanted to to to to build a better Kingdom than that of Michael there there then he was defeated there he was thrown down with his angels Jesus said to the Pharisees you come from below I come from above then we meet one another if you are here you are influenced from somewhere either you are influenced From Below or you are influenced from above but you can't do otherwise it's not in your power you have to do what you are you are want to do you can't do other You Are Not Alone where you are now you are with somebody then you are influenced is either from above or From Below then we have got a captain our captain is the Lord Jesus Christ he called himself I am the great Shepherd a good shepherd shepherd of the Sheep he said my sheep hear my voice his voice is his weight every time his way his voice must come from a messenger a messenger of each age is the voice of God for that particular age are you together when you just read it little come back here yes we read verse 5 five there verse five and out of the throne proceedeth Lightnings and thunderings and voices and there were seven lamps of fire burning Before the Throne which are the seven spirits of God out of the throne proceeded Lightnings and thundering and voices which voices this is at judgment these voices and lighten are at judgment these voice are the voices of seven Messengers The Voices will be Echo there a judgment and the voices of pastors there brother Bram said to us he said forgive me but I am the voice of God to you and a pastor of a church [Music] because the prophet says so and the Bible says so he is the angel of that church he is the prophet of that church the prophet says God brings the message directly to the shepherd not to the [Music] [Applause] Sheep there is no sheep which can have knowledge more than the shepher if the Sheep has got more knowledge than the Shepherd that sheep is influenced From Below because if it is influen from above the message from above it goes straight to the shepherd sayth my [Applause] Prophet the Holy Spirit brings the message straight to the Shepherd that the shepherd start to be the voice the voice of God to the sheep and Jesus says my sheep hear my [Applause] voice they hear my voice if there is a messenger the prophet says The Messengers they are the ones who make God known they are the ones who make God known to the people there is no way of knowing god beside those seven Messengers otherwise it is from [Music] [Applause] below those who call upon the name of the Lord the B they will be saved and he says how can they call upon it if they don't know it how can they know it if there is no preacher in other words for a man or a person to hear the voice of God there must be a preacher amen are you together with me my sheep he my voice if you are the Sheep of God you hear the voice of God from your pastor the voice of God not of [Music] Lucifer by the of it is from your Shepherd a sheep without the shepherd is a lost sheep a church without the shepherd it's not the [Applause] church this Prophet is the Bible here the B says voices be judged by the voice you have [Music] heard you will hear it loud and clear and you will judge yourself and you'll know your direction or you'll know your direction the prophet says Resurrection will be like waves the the church the church age the first church age Saints they will rise up with their message you see under each message there are pastors there and pastors will raise up with their wave with who will you [Music] raise all right let's go on a little bit voice our the armies coming down with the captain during the ages they were fighting you cannot fight without the direction of your cap if you fight without the instruction you will be killed when you fight you must listen to the [Music] direction this they they were following their Captain because they fed the wall they fed the war with the instruction of the cap in each Church age until the church Ages were over and they went to their F station and they were out of the F station with the kep there then going to the second station and the second station was the Millennium before they go there there was a war there the war was the it it is prepared now now they busy preparing is not ours but this one is ours because the kings of the read it my brother there I will tell you where to [Music] read 19 verse 19 Revelation 19 verse 19 yeah chapter 19 verse 19 and I saw the Beast and the kings of the earth and their armies gathered together to make war against him that sat on the horse and against his army amen do you are you hearing it I saw the Beast and the kings of the earth and their armies GA together to make war against him that set on the horse and against his army he doesn't start here this is the end [Applause] of Amen read my brother verse 20 ver 20 and the Beast was taken and with him the false prophet that brought Miracles before him with which he deceived them that had received the mark of the beast and them that worshiped His Image these both were cast alive into the Lake of Fire Burning with Brimstone you see what happened but before we get there I'm going to stop but before I stop let's read chapter 16 chapter 16 uh verse 13 there verse 13 to 14 14 oh to 16 and I saw three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the dragon and out of the mouth of the Beast and out of the mouth of the false prophet for they are the spirit of devils working miracles which go forth unto the kings of the earth and of the whole world to gather them to the battle of the great day of God Almighty three unclean spirits coming out of the mouth of the Beast out of the mouth of the false prophet this false prophet is the prophet of this Beast because it was a process started with being the spirit the false prophet the Beast then this this unclean space as I am told by our Prophet they are the TR spirit [Music] this is this the three Spirit like frogs all people who are anointed by these Spirits they always look back to their doctr there from n they they are moving like frogs the frog doesn't move [Music] forward that is how these people are working they they've built their Bible School to teach people their Doctrine back they won they don't go forward what they teach you back they say this these Spirits they are working miracles you see them that doing Miracles they go for to Kings the kings of the Earth to the world to the whole world Gathering people together how using this miracle but when when God is gathering us when he's Gathering his bride open the SE that is how he's Gathering his by opening the SE together the Bri together but when this one when they gather people they G them with [Music] Miracles you cannot you cannot deceive the bride with Miracle you can do Miracles whatsoever the just look at [Music] you but she knows where she come
