[34:12] we are here father we are the Seed of
[34:15] Abraham
[34:17] we'd like to thank you Lord that in you
[34:20] Lord there were attributes
[34:23] and those attributes father they were
[34:26] the words
[34:28] and the words my father became flesh
[34:30] Lord
[34:32] and the father there was a man Lord
[34:35] who stood in the cab my father
[34:38] because Lord there was a gap that was
[34:41] there a man was no longer in his
[34:43] position
[34:45] but the father we thank you Lord that
[34:47] the father
[34:48] when Jesus died on the cross
[34:52] the prophet said father
[34:54] he hold two strings
[34:58] and brought them together Lord
[35:01] and the father we like to thank you

[35:22] were there the the time of the end
[35:25] but you said to him Daniel go rest

[35:31] because the father you knew that a
[35:33] father there will be sons and daughters
[35:35] that will Arise My Father in the end
[35:38] times
[35:39] where Bible father the Bible says the
[35:42] nature was waiting for those Sons to be
[35:46] manifested
[35:47] we like to thank you my father that Lord
[35:50] your pride is here today

[36:23] under the world there are creatures my
[36:26] father that they want to arise but they
[36:29] can arise Lord because the other foot
[36:31] you know the Bible says it is on top of
[36:34] the sea the other foot it is on the
[36:37] earth my father because your bride is
[36:40] still here Lord

[36:44] have power to arise because we are still
[36:47] here Lord we are waiting for that day

[1:44:04] I want to go faster and he said don't
[1:44:08] try it
[1:44:09] amen amen
[1:44:11] just remain what you are
[1:44:17] that scripture
[1:44:23] and I had a great voice out of Heaven
[1:44:26] saying behold the seven angle of God is
[1:44:29] with me and he will dwell with them and
[1:44:32] they shall be his people and God himself
[1:44:35] shall be with them and be their Lord
[1:44:37] amen amen
[1:44:39] now I want where it says
[1:44:46] is it verse 9.
[1:44:51] is it in Revelation 21 verse 9. yes yes
[1:44:54] and they came unto me one of the Seven
[1:44:57] Angels which had the seven miles full of
[1:45:00] the seven last legs and talk with me
[1:45:03] saying come hither I will show a bit of
[1:45:06] light the length wife amen and he
[1:45:09] carried me away in the spirits to a
[1:45:12] great and high mountain
[1:45:13] and showed me that great City the holy
[1:45:16] Jerusalem descending Out of Heaven from
[1:45:19] God having the glory of God and her life
[1:45:23] was like unto the soul most precious
[1:45:26] even like the Justice okay
[1:45:31] then you go further it says
[1:45:35] where the city we saw the city coming
[1:45:39] down
[1:45:40] [Music]
[1:45:41] you know
[1:45:43] and
[1:45:45] saw we will reach all those scriptures
[1:45:52] things started to come down
[1:45:58] and even that very same scripture
[1:46:02] where it says
[1:46:05] that is from verse one
[1:46:08] just read that part
[1:46:10] from verse 1
[1:46:12] . and I saw a new Heaven and the new end
[1:46:15] for the first Heaven and the first
[1:46:17] Empire passed away
[1:46:19] and there was no more sea
[1:46:22] and I John saw the holy city New
[1:46:24] Jerusalem coming down from God out of
[1:46:27] him amen amen
[1:46:29] yeah we'll read that we'll look at it
[1:46:34] coming down
[1:46:37] all the things that were
[1:46:41] in heaven
[1:46:42] [Music]
[1:46:44] coming he saw them coming down
[1:46:50] The Pride coming down the city coming
[1:46:53] down
[1:46:54] amen amen and Heaven stopped the Angels
[1:47:00] when things went out amen
[1:47:05] amen amen and then he continues to say
[1:47:09] then the Lord will be with us here on
[1:47:13] Earth
[1:47:19] you can finish it
[1:47:22] okay
[1:47:23] now there's another
[1:47:27] party
[1:47:29] I'm looking at before we
[1:47:33] and
[1:47:36] we start off
[1:47:42] the things no yeah we are looking at
[1:47:46] things here
[1:47:48] now we are going to follow
[1:47:52] these things
[1:47:59] I read in this book
[1:48:01] Elijah was a daughter
[1:48:06] and the servant couldn't see all those
[1:48:10] Angels around today
[1:48:12] [Music]
[1:48:17] and God changed not brought the Angels
[1:48:22] down but he changed the seeing of that
[1:48:27] young man
[1:48:36] and meaning that and there was
[1:48:40] the mountain full of angels
[1:48:49] Chariots of Fire around the prophets
[1:48:58] he changed death the scene
[1:49:06] the thing
[1:49:08] who was already there
[1:49:16] to see things that were there all the
[1:49:19] time
[1:49:22] and I believe what is that is what is
[1:49:25] happening to us
[1:49:27] these things have been there
[1:49:31] but to God came to change the scene
[1:49:38] because he says
[1:49:40] this like this seventh seal
[1:49:45] has been there from
[1:49:48] question is from Genesis
[1:49:51] from the beginning of Genesis the thing
[1:49:56] I've been there all the time
[1:49:58] but today he has changed our scene
[1:50:04] that we see the things that have been
[1:50:07] there
[1:50:10] you couldn't see them because it was not
[1:50:12] yet the time amen
[1:50:16] but when the time arrives we opened our
[1:50:19] eyes to see the things that have been
[1:50:22] there
[1:50:25] so this is what we are looking at
[1:50:30] I saw I
[1:50:33] will open this old scripture here
[1:50:38] forgive me because I've got this some
[1:50:40] books here
[1:50:43] yeah so
[1:50:45] there is uh my brother I I have I had
[1:50:50] this book with you
[1:50:53] senses this is the time
[1:50:56] I wonder it is here with me or with you
[1:51:01] says is this the time now
[1:51:05] your book says is this the time is it
[1:51:08] here okay
[1:51:12] oh God bless you God bless you God bless
[1:51:14] you
[1:51:16] yeah I borrowed the book from him
[1:51:20] then
[1:51:22] the commission now
[1:51:24] and uh
[1:51:27] because the word of God like like like
[1:51:29] it comes
[1:51:32] uh
[1:51:33] like in the folder sorry
[1:51:39] yeah it comes like the first seal a
[1:51:42] little

[1:57:04] that was a good answer
[1:57:08] we shall never come to conclusions
[1:57:11] unless the universe is put into our
[1:57:15] hearts
[1:57:17] [Music]
[1:57:18] as this morning will never come to
[1:57:21] conclusions
[1:57:23] if the weight is not in our souls
[1:57:29] we'll just be reading and reading but
[1:57:34] never come to conclusion
[1:57:37] it's a page of who we are
[1:57:40] where are we going
[1:57:43] all right amen now I reach
[1:57:48] yeah serious now here yes
[1:57:50] yes I could see
[1:57:53] I will start from here I could see those
[1:57:57] angels
[1:58:01] those shaped back Wings traveling faster
[1:58:10] faster than sound
[1:58:13] foreign
[1:58:27] [Music]
[1:58:40] they I I they were
[1:58:43] there
[1:58:44] I didn't have time to count
[1:58:49] I didn't have time no more than just
[1:58:54] look
[1:58:54] [Music]
[1:58:57] Mighty one's great powerful engines
[1:59:00] [Music]
[1:59:03] now
[1:59:04] with white wings
[1:59:07] and uh
[1:59:10] with whistling sound
[1:59:15] then I was caught up into this
[1:59:20] pyramidity now that is the Pyramid of
[1:59:23] the Angels
[1:59:25] oh yeah
[1:59:26] you have the Pyramid of Enoch pyramid
[1:59:31] then you come
[1:59:33] and you have the pyramid pyramid which
[1:59:38] is the interpretation of brother
[1:59:43] because
[1:59:46] as we say was responsible for the
[1:59:50] structure the pyramids
[1:59:56] then no one could interpret that pyramid
[2:00:03] in Egypt
[2:00:05] until the seventh Angel message
[2:00:09] amen amen he interpreted the pyramid
[2:00:17] both inside the seven steps to the
[2:00:20] king's chamber come on
[2:00:22] [Music]
[2:00:27] he is supernaturally discovered that
[2:00:30] Enoch
[2:00:31] yeah
[2:00:33] the seventh man from
[2:00:39] even scientists believe it
[2:00:42] that or he is the man responsible for
[2:00:46] the pyramid
[2:00:50] now the prophet of God tells me the
[2:00:53] pyramid is God's sign
[2:00:58] that's why you have seen throughout the
[2:01:01] years
[2:01:04] [Music]
[2:01:10] there will be a pyramid
[2:01:15] if you have followed
[2:01:17] the message God has blessed us
[2:01:24] we've been coming up with the pyramids
[2:01:37] [Music]
[2:01:48] from the beginning to the end
[2:01:52] I mean now the real Ministry
[2:01:55] has a pyramid side
[2:01:59] seven steps to God
[2:02:02] up to the king's chamber
[2:02:06] just like Abraham
[2:02:10] the ministry of Abraham
[2:02:13] as it says in the book
[2:02:18] it says in the book
[2:02:20] who is this melchized
[2:02:25] yeah who is this
[2:02:29] he was God
[2:02:35] you know he comes in many names
[2:02:40] when he fought in heaven he was Michael
[2:02:47] Jehovah
[2:02:51] you know amen and Christ
[2:02:56] question
[2:02:58] uh hey we will look at that we'll come
[2:03:02] to that
[2:03:03] Christ
[2:03:05] have you got this book no
[2:03:08] no I I was looking at it Christy
[2:03:13] is the mystery of God revealed
[2:03:20] you page that book
[2:03:25] yeah amen amen
[2:03:26] it doesn't say Jesus
[2:03:29] it says Christ
[2:03:33] the mystery not Jesus is it Jesus no
[2:03:37] amen
[2:03:39] because in if you go back
[2:03:42] was the spirit God is a spirit
[2:03:48] out of this spirit
[2:03:50] the logos
[2:03:52] out of the Lord
[2:03:53] the men okay
[2:03:56] that that is that free food
[2:04:00] originally
[2:04:02] the spirit
[2:04:05] the logos the logos the men
[2:04:09] out of the logos
[2:04:11] came forth
[2:04:16] amen amen and uh
[2:04:20] even
[2:04:22] you know the Bible says yeah
[2:04:24] we are born of God
[2:04:27] and he that is born of God
[2:04:31] uh
[2:04:36] [Music]
[2:04:41] he can
[2:04:43] keep himself
[2:04:47] but the Bible simply says because he is
[2:04:55] [Music]
[2:04:56] because he is born of God
[2:04:59] you can see
[2:05:03] you can keep yourself from singing but
[2:05:06] because
[2:05:08] yeah that's the simple answer
[2:05:13] if a man is born of God
[2:05:17] he cannot sin
[2:05:21] [Applause]
[2:05:22] sin is unbelief
[2:05:26] [Applause]
[2:05:28] okay now
[2:05:31] we see it that way
[2:05:36] it says Siri
[2:05:38] God
[2:05:41] gave himself birth to a son
[2:05:44] [Music]
[2:05:48] do you have it brother

[2:06:49] yeah yeah yeah
[2:06:52] it's like that all right keep it like
[2:06:55] that I'll find it
[2:07:00] um
[2:07:03] let me read here
[2:07:06] let's stick to this constellation
[2:07:12] now because things to it according to
[2:07:15] their constellations
[2:07:18] it depends
[2:07:20] in which con
[2:07:22] stellation do you belong
[2:07:29] if you look at the stars
[2:07:34] how they almighty God
[2:07:37] plant it
[2:07:39] now you'll find a star
[2:07:44] maybe what we call the main stars
[2:07:47] [Music]
[2:07:50] then you always find a cluster who
[2:07:52] starts around that menu
[2:07:54] [Music]
[2:08:06] that is a church around Paul
[2:08:11] Fashions and so forth
[2:08:13] [Music]
[2:08:14] when Paul greeted them
[2:08:18] he said
[2:08:20] how did he greet the efficient Church
[2:08:23] age
[2:08:26] okay fine
[2:08:28] chapter one there I'll tell you
[2:08:32] while I'm looking just at this stability
[2:08:35] as I was with Moses yeah
[2:08:39] so shall I be amen
[2:08:44] amen amen yeah you don't need any
[2:08:47] copyrights
[2:08:49] amen

[2:09:08] amen okay
[2:09:10] now I reach
[2:09:13] it's a wonderful thing
[2:09:17] as he was with Moses
[2:09:20] then he said so I will be
[2:09:25] the same way
[2:09:33] only don't be afraid
[2:09:38] it is my mission okay
[2:09:42] amen
[2:09:46] amen that's how we worship
[2:09:51] as he was
[2:09:53] with the seventh angel messenger
[2:09:58] so is he with us
[2:10:04] before I can go to worship
[2:10:08] I look for that place
[2:10:22] I will find the very same ministry
[2:10:25] as he was with Moses so easy
[2:10:30] [Music]
[2:10:35] before you go high away
[2:10:38] we have read yesterday
[2:10:41] I reminded the children of God he said
[2:10:45] to God
[2:10:48] Joshua

[2:11:00] if you say Hey brother thinks he's a
[2:11:04] Jewish

[2:11:17] Joshua are those who will cause
[2:11:21] the children of God to cross over

[2:11:37] of the church ages

[2:35:16] now let me yes our our book here
[2:35:21] our names
[2:35:24] let me put it here it's safe
[2:35:27] right

[2:35:38] eternity
[2:35:39] you saw this seven angels coming
[2:35:43] um
[2:35:46] amen amen then

[2:36:16] coming
[2:36:18] under the zodiac signs
[2:36:24] and
[2:36:25] as the messenger says
[2:36:28] then they were
[2:36:30] issues
[2:36:39] because if God sends his
[2:36:42] word
[2:36:44] his sense is it right into
[2:36:48] the constellations
[2:36:52] hookah

[2:56:23] of our Lord Jesus Christ
[2:56:26] amen amen you may take your seats
[2:56:33] God bless you
[2:56:36] thank you Pastor
[2:56:40] one man is Mark Anthony
[2:56:46] when
[2:56:48] he attended the burial of Julius Caesar
[2:56:53] he said
[2:56:56] I'm not here to pray Caesar foreign
[2:57:10] or to praise myself
[2:57:14] but to say the truth
[2:57:17] because I am standing at the pulpit one
[2:57:24] as the Pastor said we are from Far
[2:57:26] together
[2:57:30] I don't know what the pasta has seen
[2:57:38] long ago
[2:57:41] he was with his office
[2:57:44] [Music]
[2:57:55] he was with his butt
[2:57:59] I don't know
[2:58:04] foreign
[2:58:18] I can't tell you the name of the man
[2:58:22] that man was set
[2:58:25] was set
[2:58:28] of what the pastor said
[2:58:32] of being a pastor was not in me
[2:58:35] [Music]
[2:58:37] but I think that man
[2:58:39] also saw that potential
[2:58:46] he was said
[2:58:48] not late
[2:58:51] he told
[2:58:52] somebody
[2:58:54] about that is
[2:58:58] long time
[2:59:03] ago should be the pasta here
[2:59:12] our pastor
[2:59:14] he started with pasta Maremma
[2:59:20] they were Pasta
[2:59:22] Pasta Pasta
[2:59:28] is it to be the pastor
[2:59:32] but when he anointed me
[2:59:35] he he did a different thing foreign
[2:59:39] [Music]
[2:59:42] and gave it to me
[2:59:45] it's not what he did to other pastors
[2:59:50] when he was anointing them
[2:59:53] one day I was at the Tabernacle day
[2:59:58] having this Bible of my this one
[3:00:01] he took the Bible from me
[3:00:03] he put it on his
[3:00:06] chest
[3:00:09] and took it away I told you
[3:00:12] then when he had to stay on the pulpit
[3:00:16] he gave the Bible back to me
[3:00:19] [Music]
[3:00:21] I don't know I don't know what he was
[3:00:23] doing
[3:00:24] but if you believe in him to be the man
[3:00:27] of God
[3:00:28] if you believe him
[3:00:32] [Music]
[3:00:35] if you are not a hypocrite
[3:00:38] but if you are a True Believer
[3:00:41] if you believe this meant to be a man of
[3:00:44] God
[3:00:48] if you respect him you respect me
[3:00:54] because
[3:00:56] he showed that he respect me
[3:01:02] when he was anointing me there
[3:01:04] he said people are still coming here
[3:01:08] [Music]
[3:01:13] will come but Lord
[3:01:18] and I've taken those ways
[3:01:21] the Bible says
[3:01:25] when the angel spoke to her
[3:01:28] when the pastors came and spoke to her
