of you remember that so we will continue with that may the Lord bless you all as for today let us read uh the book of Ephesians chapter one we'll read verse four and five Ephesians chapter 1 verse 4 and 5 Ephesians chapter 1 verse four and 5 oh brother harest is here yes amen okay according as he have chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blame before him in love having predestinated us unto the adoption of children by Jesus Christ to himself according to the good pleasure of his will okay let's bow our heads Mighty God The Great I Am amen the one who knew us before the foundation of the world Amen as we have read Lord Almighty the way of wisdom according to St Paul amen that Lord you knew us before the foundation of the world Hallelujah and father we believe that these two verses that we have read you will be the one Lord that will expound Lord and explain it unto us father amen Believers are here Lord Almighty and everything has been done accordingly Lord God Almighty amen Believers have served you with hymns and songs and items Lord and with prayers they have prayed gracious Heavenly Father amen their hearts Lord Almighty are bubling to hear from thee amen hallelujah so we all stand here Lord knowing that without you there's nothing that we can do yes so we Commit This Moment unto the Lord and knowing father that you never failed us amen whenever Lord Almighty we gathered in this fashion you always come in the midst and speak to us amen just like you've been doing with Israel yes there was a time where they gathered together and Lord Almighty the Bible said you look through a cloud when you are looking at Israel but with us Lord you are looking deep down into our hearts the word Lord that you have planted in our hearts amen we pray Lord Almighty that may we feel you may we see you may we hear you Lorden father thank you we pray in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ amen amen you may be seated okay I I have a title here I I always like to explain my my title the title is the migration of the processed attributes you know the prophet says we we if I had to explain the title the the the prophet says we are processed from God and then when we are processed from God he also continues that we we are attributes amen we are attributes so then now those attributes okay let me put it like this our great great great grandfather Adam for the title you know about and then God took it now the ministry of the third pool is of The Inheritance it's when that title deed has been given over to us but order that we should receive that title it was a processed now because we attributes from him we were born in a different way Adam was the Bible says he formed Men Out of the Dust of the Earth but we were born from our parents now after I formed men out of the Dust of he breathed the breath of life and Men became a living soul but with us we born by our parents we had our bodies had the genes of our parents and the prophet says the first person that taught you the first step it's your mother was the one that was teaching you how to walk and then where you grow a little bit older your father took over so he taught you Administration now T you about life and thereafter your teacher took over teaching you about the intelligence and thereafter God took over bringing the divine nature are we together amen now when God brings the divine nature unto you it was a process until right where now you are a fully grown in the [Music] Lord before he can give you the title D now now that he has given you the title what are you doing with that title de mind you we are not starting from where when you were born we are in a point where you have already crossed over you you've crossed over like like the children of Israel when they cross the River Jordan after crossing the river Jordan Moses I mean Joshua met the cap of the host in other words now Joshua gave them their inheritance when he gave them their inheritance what happened there now the prophet says the the Holy Ghost will raise Joshua who will give us our inheritance now that they have given us our inheritance what next that's where we are now because we are the processed attributes now at this point at this hour at this moment what are we supposed to do right now my my my title then has to do with that migration now now the migration is the movement from one part of something to another in Zoology there's seasonal movement animals move according to a season from one region to another pulled by by the changing of the the season right now we have read here the scriptures he said according as he has chosen Us in him before the foundation so which means then God has chosen Us in him that's why the proess the prophet said we were process who has chosen Us in him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and Without Blame before him in love now when we when we when we say we are the attributes we are not looking at this body no we are looking at the word of God that is Holy and it's Without Blame and before him now in our case our inheritance is the revealed word or is the fullness of the way are we together now what is the revealed weight and what is the fullness of [Music] the we know that in the beginning was the word the word was with God the word is God and if the word is God when God uh brings the word unto us and we receive it and he revealed it and then after the revelation of that way we speak about the fullness of the it's now a full we but now it was a process to the fullness of the are we together now but God when he look at us he look at us through the way he only see fullness he only see Perfection are we together that is why he says now he chose us and after he knew us and he called right amen he called us because he knew us but that thing was done before the foundation of [Music] okay so now it's a seasonal movement uh now in our case it's a dispens ational Movement we we move according to the just read verse 9 up to 11 uh from verse 9 it's saying yeah same same same chapter chapter one Ephesians chapter 1 verse 9 having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he has proposed in himself okay fine it says having made known unto us the mystery of his will there is a will within him but but it's a mysterious will it's a mystery that is why whenever we speak about the seventh seed we say it is revealed in a secret Myst see because God whatever he do he do it in a mysterious way the bride is the mystery itself so as you are you are a mystery the word of God is a mystery right now when it says having made known unto us the mystery of his will now he had a will but when he brings it forth to us it comes in a mysterious way it's always hidden in that mystery remember last time I read you a code where the Prophet was trying to explain now you canot explain a mystery until he said I feel watched they are checking on me now the prophet what I want to us to notice here okay let me finish up this Mr of his will according to his good pleasure which he has purposed in himself now if he had a purpose that is within himself he will give it to those that have got the same purpose he had a purpose now his purpose can never be understood by an ordinary person no that is his purpose the person that would like to understand his purpose that person must be God he must be exactly like him because God understands himself now in order that he should understand himself he should give you the understanding of who he is now if he gives you that understanding he has to make you a God first you must be a God first a god with small G so that you could understand are we together amen so now that is the purose now in verse 10 it says that in the dispensation of the fullness of time he might gather together in one all things in Christ yeah in the dispensation of the fullness of time now what I want you to notice here is that now the prophet brother Brenham was a chosen Prophet but God didn't choose him to make a mark time left right left right standing one place no God wouldn't like that so he want him to move right that's what I want to show you there was a time where the Prophet stood made a a mark time left right left right standing one place until God sent an angel to tell him to move now the church stood stood one at one place making a left right left right left right until God told the bride to cross over they shouldn't make a a mark time left standing at one place amen they must move now you as the bride of Christ you should be in a migration you don't stand one place you move we were in different denomination then we moved then we had the call then we listen to that and then we move on but our stopping place should be the New Jerusalem right now uh the migration is according to the dispensation when the children of Israel moved out of of Egypt on their way it was the dispensation that changed the ministry in each and every dispensation the ministry changed right Moses took them out with a different Ministry they crossed the Red Sea in the desert they had a different Ministry it's another dispensation until they cross over and when they cross over it's another dispensation what you need to notice is this that after they cross the River Jordan they met the cap of the host now just look at there after meeting the the the cap of the host what was the reaction to Israel what was Israel doing now that there's a captain of the remember the promise says they go to the land of milk and honey remember Caleb and Joshua brought fruits but after crossing over did they get milk and [Music] honey so after crossing over there was no milk and honey Caleb himself he met Giants he's the one that says we will eat them now it was given to him because he said he will eat him there are the giants eat them see Caleb was given Mount hor I mean hebon that was the generation of go very huge guys then he was supposed to fight and possess now after crossing over you've got your inheritance you've given they've given Caleb there your inheritance and it actually is himself said to to to to to to uh to his friend joshuaa you remember Moses promise me that place give me that give me the very same place that he say dangerous give me yeah so now when we have our inheritance amen we need to bring forth what to do after we received our inheritance what do we do with that inheritance what did Joshua do after he met the captain of the what did Brother do after meeting the notable one right amen okay fine let's read another scripture here in the Book of Matthew and then we will go to some quotes remember what we we we're talking about the the migration since we are the attributes of God and we are the process we don't have any stop station there's no stop station where we'll be standing there and say now Matthew Chapter 13 let's read uh verse 10 brother Harvest Matthew 13:1 mhm and the disciples came and and said unto him why speakest thou unto them in Parables remember at all times the ministry is directed to certain people those people of that Ministry whenever there's a a Ministry there are people the the the ministry is directed to those people the others will have questions but they will never get an answer when when when when we were fellowshipping yesterday I was saying when when Christ met Peter he never explained he just said follow me he was with his father so Peter and his brother follow Christ left his father right amen they never said who are you why should we follow you and he also never explained because they knew each other before the foundation of the world so they were speaking their own language which was not known to Peter's father uh you remember Elijah also he just touched Elisha just touched him never explain never sit down and and read codes and and scriptures he just spoke the Heavenly language of a and then what did Elish do said wait for me he slaughtered his cows and said bye-bye to his father he recognized that was the physical father now he has met a supernatural he said byebye and then from that day he was with El are we together amen now here the disciples came and said unto him why do you speak in Parables when you speak to them and Matthew 13: 11 he answered and said unto them because it is given it is given unto you to know the Mysteries of the Kingdom of Heaven the Kingdom of Heaven is a MST it's for a specific type and it comes in a mysterious way to the other people it's something that they cannot understand just as the seventh seal itself the SE is a mystery then it came to the mysterious people they understand it because it's God himself now they migrated to a position where they became God because in the Book of John 10:35 when the word of God comes to you it makes you a God right amen it's when it when it's when your your jeans changes to that of a natur supernatural because you've got the human genes now you go now to the supernatural like like like like Peter said that now God let's read it amen uh first Peter second Peter chapter 1 ver3 just read it my prayer chapter 1 verse 3 and 4 just just listen to that according as his divine power have given unto us all things that pertain unto life and godliness so now he's speaking that now there is a div divine power that has given unto us all things that pertain unto life there's a divine power that gives us all things that pertain unto life and godl that has got life godliness then he needs to give you a divine power to have an understanding he must give you a spirit of knowledge and understanding right let's go back to Matthew we're not through with that he answered and said unto them because it is given unto you to know the mysteries of the Kingdom of Heaven but to them it is not given there are those that are given there are those that are not given so when the two meet they don't understand because the others are given the others are not given you know when our Lord Jesus Christ went to raise uh tabita he called Peter James and John and get into the house he didn't take the other disciples did he take the other people he took the people brother Bram says he says he took faith hope and charity he didn't want somebody that is not in that PN that is not in that understanding he took the people that when he says tell no one they don't say why shouldn't because they have the understanding why even if you can tell them who will believe you I always say to you you can go to heaven now meet God sit with God and communicate with him and come back and come to us and said yesterday was with nicely together and then he said I must greet you we will take you to the scope you see no nobody will believe you now the ministry of the uh the revelation of the seven got nothing to do with our [Applause] understanding it's just people from eternity they receive what is [Applause] theirs it's not for the public it's for the one that comes from there so he look Abraham Abraham I me God said Abraham go to the place in which I will show you he showed him the place this is Palestine your land and then Joseph took the children of Israel out to Egypt and when they go back to the to to to to to Palestine they go there as the jeans of Abraham it's not that they are it's the first time that they saw the place they there their forefather knows about it and they come from him that is why in them there is an edge there's a pool that from their forefathers that is their place you won change them and each and everyone knows exactly there was a time where Nebuchadnezzar destroyed the temple and took them away into slavery when they came back they didn't fumble they know where the foundation is and they did not doubt themselves if you are in one of the House of Benjamin you know that I'm Benjamin this is Ruben they know themselves now we know ourselves [Applause] the the the ministry of the third pool it does not remind you it restores you it takes you back where you belong will you will feel that now this is my place this is my Ministry together amen that's how it is then then then that's why he says now it is given unto them to know the the mysteries of the Kingdom of Heaven to the others you can howl and howl and shout and Shout you will never convince them for verse 12 says for whosoever had to him shall be given and he shall have more abundance but whosoever had not from him shall be taken even that he had so that means because it's yours it will be added abundantly the one who had a little bit not knowing that it's his be taken away it's not his that is why the pastor always will say if a person has got the book entitled The revelation of the seven and he says the the seven seal is not revealed let let him bring that book back because it does not belong to him I'm sure he mentioned that many time it's not his book even if you can read it until he ache you will are we together amen therefore verse 13 speak I to them in Parables because they seeing not and hearing they hear not neither do they understand they will never reach the destination right because whatever they think they are seeing they really don't see whatever ever they think they are hearing they don't hear neither do they understand you cannot make him to understand it should be revealed unto verse 14 says in them is fulfill the prophecy of Isaiah when he says by hearing shall hear and shall not understand you hear you don't understand and seeing you shall see and shall not perceive in other words they will not become aware right amen if you read also you don't have to read the Ephesians 1:9 Ephesians 1:9 it's speaks about uh the good pleasure that was in God he he had a purpose and that purpose gave him a pleasure there was pleasure in that okay fine let me just uh read you a a quote where now the prophet I mean God rebuked the prophet for not moving on yeah now he says I'm I'm reading this quote here it's in this book experiences that was preached in 19477 now I'm very careful about this books that were preached uh years before how can I put it last time I preach to you I quoted a quote where now the prophet says speaking about faith and doubt so that book says it's in the spirit after service a sister call said no brother faith and doubt is in the soul in the spirit I said thank you my sister I will stand at the pull pit and rectify it you see it's good that now uh we are preaching to the people yeah if you try to mix things it's not like this yeah thank you my sister I'm sure she hears me now I'm rectifying it right now what what I'm reading here is uh this book it was preached 1947 1947 uh the prophet says in this book uh it's uh experiences experiences don't forget I'm trying to show you that the prophets stood instead of going forward and then God was not happy about it because he was supposed to go forward because he was called for aose not to and and you are also called for a purose not time left right you have you have to move yeah then the prophet said you need to be a trained soldier now paragraph 10 [Music] says I love to listen and I like to help that is the prophet and then everyone that to to help everyone that I can in doing so I let my nature get away from God says now if I listen and try to help I let my nature get away from God I explain that see my will of think is not always God's will of think right I'll explain that when we come then he continues yeah it's still in in in in paragraph 10 said if I don't get some kind of strength from somewhere else by this time next year there'll be somebody else doing this besides me right says I see my human strength living it's because that something in my heart reaches out for the people now a prophet is born a prophet he is born for a purpose now the prophets the Bible says he will turn the heart of the children to their fathers after he then he must restore and after restoration what look God had a purpose about him but now he came to a point where he stood still and trying to help people and feeling for the people and by doing that he was standing still I'll show you he was not moving he was concentrating on the people and forget that he is a prophet he must take the church let it move ree right amen he that's why I said I see my human strength living because he was using his own human strength because that's something in my heart reaches out uh then he continu says uh I'll show you the what I don't want to read that one amen okay he says now what I did I just bring them on because I know the strength of the power of God and how that God let me get with that uh you know what he did he said to the people in short you don't have to repent you don't have to come as you are will heal you and people came the power of God was in the prophet he prayed for them and they were healed but now he said I made a something that even Jesus Christ didn't do I'll will read you that what you call amen he say I said just bring them on because I knew the strength of the power of God and how that God let me get by with that know I do not know says I I don't know why did God let me go on with that to say to the people you don't have to have Fai come as you so now people they mobilize brother knows that we we go somewhere and then we we call people we give them food we give them clothing give them Bibles pens scri so now they don't come for the word of God some some of them they say no there's a church that gives fre I I us to car Joseph where Joseph Joseph used to care more than 50 BBL once you give him that Bible so now brother brother Bram was saying to people you don't have to have faith you just come come God will heal you and then that was wrong to God and then he says now God how did God let me uh do that because I said they must come even if they don't believe but the power of God was in him are we together amen now he say says he will always be visited by the angel of the Lord that will be paragraph 11 just to save time I'm not going to read there it says now at vanala Illinois was the time of the visitation of an Angel and the next time the angel never visited him for six months now he was preaching one day preaching about balam you know that bam the prophet of the Moes who who who prayed to God that he should go and C Israel so he was preaching about himing about him and then one day he was on the room the angel of the Lord appeared and look at him and then he fell down when he fell down he screamed and fell down and people came rushing that angel just look at him the angel that used to visit him and talk to him nicely that day he came and and then he fell down right amen then he went on and the other day preaching about balam then God said you wearing the shoes of Palam when you accusing did exactly what now that that was I've got it here you go and read the book experiences then he said now in in paragraph 13 he went down there and the angel of the Lord uh met him on the way what a mistake that I made I made an assession an assession is a forceful statement assession to the people of a power of God that even the son of God never made any statement like that so when Jesus Christ was here on Earth your faith heal you your faith heal you he didn't say come without faith so he said I made a mistake I did that even the Son of God has never done that I I made a challenging let them bring people and they came and they were healed why did God let me do so the angel of the Lord was away for the whole six months when came back it was angry and then brother God revealed that now you are called to move on because if you take the BAM and Moses the basics were the same they worship the same God they speak to the same God and God answered them see if you take the ch they worship the same God they speak to God they cast the me the demons in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ the basics are the same but now what makes you differs as the bride how do you differ from the church you use the name of Jesus they use the name of Jesus they cast The Demon out will move away P they do that so your Basics are the same the same God answer them but the difference between Moses and balam Moses had the pillar of fire the difference between you and church is that you've got the pillar over the killer of fire in you is the revealed way they've got the word you've got the word but yours is rallu and then you manifest it our Lord Jesus Christ when he was here on Earth was to manifest the he didn't say I am Jesus no he just did manifest until they could say surely this is the Son of God he manifest that way now the bride is manifesting that way Basics can be the same amen if there's miracles to perform always Jesus did that uh the Prophet went to uh is quoting this this this book here this PS here the Psalm of Life P of life he said now uh the Psalm of Life in this in this Psalm the psalm was written by Long Fellow those that knows it was written by a poet he speaking about footprints on the sense of time some of you have got some of you have got that book uh Long Fellow was described was very much impressed he said that he liked it speaks about pleasure and sorrow he says pleasure or sorrow is not the goal of life in other words when God calls you he didn't call you to be sorrowful Nei did he call you for a pleasure it's not the goal of Life the purpose of life is to carry out all all duties and responsibilities for the progress of good will for the progress of good and for all you don't have to stop here and say I am sorrowful I'm not going anywhere because I am sorrowful you don't have to stop yet say ah I've good pleasure I don't move forward got what I wanted that is not the goal of life now brother speaks about himself I stopped somewhere where which was not my go right amen so now when when when when when when when he read the the the the PSAL of life then he he he came to recognize that he says now uh the the mark that the individual leaves behind each and every one of us what the footprints on the S of time speaking about your life those foodprints that you leave behind when the other people comes you they should see good things that you have done they should be able to go on your footsteps on the SS of time are we together amen so now that's what that's what he was saying though we are mortal we can live foodpre for succeeding generation here we are right now we reading what Paul did we read what Moses did we read what brother if somebody says he's a Believer he reads what Paul did he's working on the footprints of together is working on the footprints of Moses now we ourselves we need to leave a footprint are we together amen we need we need to leave a footprint okay right now whenever we are here on most of the preachers that belong to this assembly they will call their Pastor the pastor says this the pastor says this the pastor says this it's the footprints that is the prophet says this the prophet says this the fuit prince Apostle Paul says this Prophet Moses says this those are the food prce that will now watch now the last part of life is that now uh you remember that balam one to stop them from going over and crossing over but the thing is there are those who are of that life we remember Moses sent some spies and they discovered that there were some [Music] spies and somebody uh gave them a hiding place but she said remember me when you are passing by you remember am so now they were hearing that there is a nation that God has opened up the Red Sea this is what what is is coming some were already surrendering some were running away way some were just standing knowing that they it's in vain what they trying to do are we together amen now what I am trying to to to make you aware of now is that now if you go to the book of exposition of the seven Church ages the prophet speaks if if you've got I'm closing now in 5 minutes time okay if you've got a pyramid there can you just display it I want to show you because to live and not knowing who you are and to worship and not knowing what you are worshiping and to Fellowship in a place where you don't know where your pastor is taking you to if the prophet says they are to give us our inheritance you need to have a knowledge of that I am here because this man will give me my inheritance right amen now Paul I mean Peter said to to to Jesus what are we going to benefit in following you whereever and what Jesus said you are going to judge angels are going to judge are we together so now this Zeal that was okay let me finish up with that pyramid Amen in closing I want to say to you look at that that pyramid if you take the first three Church ages Ephesus Min P there was an anti chist Spirit during those three Church ages Antichrist yeah yeah one see
