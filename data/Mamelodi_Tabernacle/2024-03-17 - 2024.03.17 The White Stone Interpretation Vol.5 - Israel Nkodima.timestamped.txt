[1:36:21] were
[1:36:22] happening
[1:36:25] that's why
[1:36:28] testimon
[1:36:30] edice it helps
[1:36:32] somebody who doesn't know that God can
[1:36:38] heal so if they are some
[1:36:43] testimonies then some people will then
[1:36:46] realize that no
[1:36:49] that the Lord
[1:36:52] God the Lord Jesus
[1:36:54] Christ is a real
[1:36:59] healer I've seen that with my
[1:37:03] eyes that's why I believe if you are
[1:37:08] sick um and you have hands laid on
[1:37:13] you I believe
[1:37:15] that the Lord has already healed
[1:37:21] you for he says by his stri
[1:37:25] we were
[1:37:28] healed
[1:37:29] so uh we shall instead of singing the
[1:37:33] whole
[1:37:34] [Music]
[1:37:35] day we shall also have some
[1:37:40] testimonies for the people who want to
[1:37:42] give the glory
[1:37:48] to all right amen
[1:37:51] now brother
[1:37:55] will come and read for
[1:38:00] us I think you will
[1:38:04] also uh take note of
[1:38:08] this and read the church
[1:38:12] order it will tell

[1:47:26] amen okay
[1:47:30] yeah we are sharing that with brother
[1:47:37] gab you know as a Son of
[1:47:40] God when he was reading in the
[1:47:43] Bible he came across that
[1:47:48] chapter and
[1:47:52] that
[1:47:53] then because every
[1:47:56] scripture it should
[1:47:59] be in your
[1:48:02] heart when you read the word of
[1:48:05] God it is like after the
[1:48:10] exams you don't have to tell who has
[1:48:13] passed and who has
[1:48:18] not and
[1:48:21] uh after the
[1:48:24] exams papers go like penut you
[1:48:29] know people buy
[1:48:32] newspapers even those who can't
[1:48:36] read because the
[1:48:38] child
[1:48:40] has gone through the
[1:48:45] written exam amen amen then how do
[1:48:50] you you can make it
[1:48:54] by watching the people buying the
[1:49:01] newspapers you don't have to ask him or
[1:49:04] her whether his or her child has
[1:49:11] passed and even the young CH the
[1:49:17] students you will watch
[1:49:19] them they they rush for the newspaper
[1:49:23] [Music]

[1:49:30] Sunday we also R for the
[1:49:34] Bible amen amen
[1:49:37] amen I look whether I have made it or
[1:49:42] not and I find that God
[1:49:45] said by his stripes I was
[1:49:49] healed the Lord Jesus Christ and he
[1:49:54] said I was
[1:49:56] predestinated before the foundation of
[1:49:59] the

[1:50:04] time now you watch after the
[1:50:08] exam amen you see the newspapers go like
[1:50:13] that now how can you

[1:58:50] Noah and the Lord told
[1:58:54] the will come like
[1:58:59] that are you
[1:59:02] watching if it was
[1:59:06] prophesied then there will be some
[1:59:09] people who would see those
[1:59:14] things you know he was recently talking
[1:59:16] to
[1:59:18] somebody predicting to predicting to me
[1:59:26] things he he wants to
[1:59:29] do all right amen now he's an
[1:59:34] individual I am an
[1:59:37] individual and when he said
[1:59:41] this uh with me there was some inside of
[1:59:48] me something saying maybe the brother
[1:59:52] hasn't have not yet seen the the
[1:59:59] signs rumors of
[2:00:04] wars didn't he say
[2:00:06] so Nation against
[2:00:09] Nation what what is happening
[2:00:13] now don't you hear rumors of
[2:00:17] wars Nation against Nation the Lord God
[2:00:21] has spoken
[2:00:23] it is just exactly
[2:00:27] like amen amen but is for those he has
[2:00:32] spoken
[2:00:35] to they have had
[2:00:38] him I preach while looking for something
[2:00:43] here you know as the Bible
[2:00:47] says the book
[2:00:50] says you have heard
[2:00:53] from
[2:00:56] your if you
[2:01:00] see you will see the things you have
[2:01:06] seen predestination comes in this
[2:01:10] way God has
[2:01:14] predestinated these things in your
[2:01:19] soul but you know the Bible says
[2:01:23] uh we read that scripture last
[2:01:27] time when they said to the Lord
[2:01:31] Jesus we they told the Samaritan
[2:01:35] woman they said we have heard
[2:01:39] him
[2:01:42] our amen amen you know the word of God
[2:01:46] it's not something that you take from
[2:01:51] somebody
[2:01:53] that that man
[2:01:54] says no
[2:01:57] before when the written
[2:02:01] woman said to the prophet of
[2:02:05] God what you have
[2:02:08] said it's
[2:02:12] right
[2:02:14] and the prophet
[2:02:16] said she has set it not from
[2:02:21] here
[2:02:23] when the Samaritan woman was saying to
[2:02:26] the people Messiah is
[2:02:30] coming she was not from the bible
[2:02:34] school she was from the mind of
[2:02:38] God because the only people who can
[2:02:42] preach the right
[2:02:44] gospel are those who are in the mind of
[2:02:49] God you never receive the word of God
[2:02:53] from any
[2:02:54] school the word of God is from
[2:02:59] God you can learn about
[2:03:02] God at any
[2:03:05] school we don't have a college to teach
[2:03:08] you about
[2:03:10] God but we have the
[2:03:14] Bible all right now this Samaritan
[2:03:18] woman you are all familiar with that
[2:03:21] scripture
[2:03:22] uh
[2:03:23] said I know Messiah is
[2:03:28] coming and when he has
[2:03:31] come he will tell us all
[2:03:35] things if somebody could get me
[2:03:39] says is this the
[2:03:43] time be
[2:03:45] thankful but if not no problem we are
[2:03:48] still going to continue with the same
[2:03:51] thing in the coming
[2:03:54] days
[2:03:58] now as it got chapter
[2:04:02] 15 this
[2:04:07] one

[2:05:07] mountain it was a rock no grass when the
[2:05:10] water had washed down it had cut some
[2:05:13] kind of Readiness on on these stones and

[2:05:28] Brethren from Georgia and and from all
[2:05:31] around where we were all standing
[2:05:34] together listening to you interpret that
[2:05:36] mysterious writing on those stones that
[2:05:40] mountain and he said then you picked up

[2:08:10] God gave his
[2:08:12] son to rule over
[2:08:18] Eden so that's
[2:08:20] why Eden was made in the West Was put
[2:08:29] Westward I mean
[2:08:32] Eastward that was Eden Eden was
[2:08:40] Eastward even that
[2:08:42] gate was
[2:08:47] called the East
[2:08:50] Gate gate
[2:08:52] right amen
[2:08:54] now it says after he said look
[2:09:00] in then he
[2:09:03] went
[2:09:06] Westward meaning from the East to the
[2:09:14] West because whenever the Angels
[2:09:18] Came whever they come
[2:09:22] it was from the
[2:09:25] West because men
[2:09:31] was all right amen and now it says but
[2:09:39] you notice this part
[2:09:42] here oh now I don't have
[2:09:45] my what do you call it poter
[2:09:49] pointer you have that poter
[2:09:56] okay
[2:09:57] amen yeah my time is up
[2:10:01] here now I want you to watch
[2:10:05] this because there was another scripture
[2:10:08] he didn't
[2:10:12] read we are going to follow these
[2:10:15] things up to the
[2:10:19] end you remember last week
[2:10:22] picked up a
[2:10:26] scripture where it
[2:10:28] said ear in the
[2:10:31] morning Abraham
[2:10:33] Abraham
[2:10:36] went to the place to the place where he
[2:10:40] stood before the
[2:10:43] Lord it was
[2:10:45] referring to the time
[2:10:49] back when Abraham stood before the
[2:10:56] Lord and from that place he could see
[2:11:02] s because Abraham could see these things
[2:11:07] because he was not part of
[2:11:12] that that's why you see like
[2:11:16] today um
[2:11:18] God has given everyone chance to make
[2:11:22] his own
[2:11:26] choice that's why Abraham said to
[2:11:30] Lord if you go east and go west you go
[2:11:36] why Abraham knew
[2:11:38] that Lord would not choose the right
[2:11:43] place because it comes by
[2:11:46] [Music]
[2:11:47] predestination it was in
[2:11:50] Abraham now when the choice was made by
[2:11:55] these two men the Bible says a
[2:11:59] lord looked at at
[2:12:05] Sodom and he was
[2:12:07] pleased by the
[2:12:10] place he saw it as
[2:12:14] fertile when Agri
[2:12:18] culture can really uh
[2:12:22] Prosper
[2:12:25] Prosper but the Bible
[2:12:30] says Abraham Abraham ask Lord to choose
[2:12:39] first you know Abraham knew very
[2:12:42] well that Lord didn't have a
[2:12:50] revelation and he knew that Lord could
[2:12:54] not choose the right
[2:12:57] place that's why he
[2:13:02] said amen amen and
[2:13:06] then Lord was so
[2:13:10] pleased but the Bible
[2:13:12] says he made that
[2:13:15] choice
[2:13:20] before
[2:13:22] meaning
[2:13:23] that
[2:13:25] Abraham knew Insight of
[2:13:30] his because if God send
[2:13:34] somebody he puts all
[2:13:38] that the man is about to
[2:13:42] engage in his
[2:13:45] soul amen amen amen you can't go to
[2:13:50] Heaven by watching with your eyes
[2:13:52] looking with your
[2:13:54] eyes no because the Bible says you were
[2:14:01] predestinated you are in
[2:14:03] God today you serve God because you are
[2:14:07] in
[2:14:09] God that's where you came from each and
[2:14:13] every
[2:14:14] person has a
[2:14:18] revelation if it is not a revelation
[2:14:22] then you can't make the right
[2:14:25] choice it's only by
[2:14:29] Revelation that's why while preaching
[2:14:33] here you see a child of
[2:14:36] God a child of God once he
[2:14:41] started uh after he has found the
[2:14:45] Lord he start
[2:14:48] moving amen amen across the
[2:14:53] dimensions you you won't see the child
[2:14:55] of God ring in the fourth
[2:15:00] dimension that's not a child of God a
[2:15:03] child of God goes beyond the
[2:15:06] dimension amen
[2:15:09] amen because there are dimensions
[2:15:12] Dimension and dimension Dimension I I
[2:15:15] will read those things to
[2:15:18] you MH amen now
[2:15:23] you know Abraham
[2:15:26] Paul as a
[2:15:29] forerunner he
[2:15:31] says he went to the third
[2:15:37] heaven he didn't need an
[2:15:41] Apollo no that thing was in
[2:15:45] [Music]
[2:15:47] him and he went to the
[2:15:50] thir
[2:15:53] and you know our
[2:15:58] forun went
[2:16:02] to six
[2:16:06] diens amen amen he couldn't go to the
[2:16:11] fourth no I'll show you the fourth
[2:16:16] di how the people are
[2:16:20] trapped they can't go
[2:16:23] further even if you preach to them they
[2:16:26] are still
[2:16:28] stuck in the four
[2:16:31] dimension
[2:16:36] television have you ever seen me in
[2:16:40] television no I don't belong to that
[2:16:45] Dimension all right amen now his
[2:16:48] Dimensions
[2:16:50] dimension we will read you'll see that
[2:16:53] some people are in trying to worship
[2:16:58] God they found themselves stuck in
[2:17:02] fourth
[2:17:04] dimension and once they are there even
[2:17:07] if you preach the word of God they
[2:17:11] remain in that
[2:17:15] Dimension why they can't see further
[2:17:18] than
[2:17:20] that
[2:17:21] that's why
[2:17:23] Lord saw
[2:17:26] Sodom L saw
[2:17:29] Sodom as a nice
[2:17:32] place but the Bible says he
[2:17:38] chose
[2:17:44] before the Judgment was
[2:17:47] coming to
[2:17:50] Sodom
[2:17:52] then Abraham that's why he couldn't go
[2:17:56] there because the Judgment was
[2:17:59] coming but Lord chose that
[2:18:03] place where the fire was
[2:18:07] coming is the same thing
[2:18:10] today uh you are reading about the
[2:18:14] nuclear bombs and
[2:18:18] so people don't care about those things
[2:18:22] but those things they are in the
[2:18:27] Bible and you know the prophet of God
[2:18:32] especially the
[2:18:37] seventh what did he say about
[2:18:42] America is it is it not
[2:18:46] happening it's
[2:18:48] coming that's right all right
[2:18:52] amen uh I won't touch that
[2:18:56] today but what was
[2:19:03] prophesied the nutal
[2:19:07] home all these things will come and read
[2:19:11] the prophecy of these
[2:19:13] things and they are happening
[2:19:19] now amen
[2:19:22] did you see what is happening in
[2:19:26] Israel the Jews and the Gentiles
[2:19:30] now is getting
[2:19:33] towards that terrible
[2:19:37] time called the tribulation
[2:19:42] period you know tribulation
[2:19:45] per it won't come and the maybe the
[2:19:49] newspaper say to you the tribulation
[2:19:52] starts on
[2:19:57] Monday Abraham you didn't need to to
[2:20:00] read the
[2:20:02] newspaper to know
[2:20:05] it no what God would
[2:20:09] do as God said shall I hide from
[2:20:14] Abraham the thing that I
[2:20:17] do if you are a child of God God never
[2:20:22] will never
[2:20:23] hide something from
[2:20:27] you in as a
[2:20:30] child H he will put you in a
[2:20:34] place so that you together with
[2:20:38] him you'll be able to see this
[2:20:41] things that's why
[2:20:43] Abraham was close with God like
[2:20:47] this at the time of Sodom God said shall
[2:20:52] I hide from
[2:20:54] Abraham the thing that I
[2:20:57] do meaning that God everything that he
[2:21:03] do uh he would reveal that to
[2:21:07] Abraham Abraham now I'm going to do
[2:21:13] this amen I want to worship such a
[2:21:19] god
[2:21:21] The God Who will talk to
[2:21:25] me if there's something coming the God
[2:21:29] will tell me
[2:21:32] about amen
[2:21:34] amen Fellowship With
[2:21:39] God all right amen uh you become a
[2:21:43] friend with
[2:21:45] God and he won't hide from
[2:21:49] you
[2:21:52] your soul is more than a
[2:21:58] newspaper
[2:22:00] because you are notified of
[2:22:04] God
[2:22:06] Amen you know that
[2:22:09] scripture shall I from
[2:22:13] Abraham the thing that I
[2:22:17] do there's another scripture before I
[2:22:20] close
[2:22:22] we read that last was it a
[2:22:26] revelation we read the scripture
[2:22:28] together with this
[2:22:30] one Revelation
[2:22:32] 19 was it vers 11 to3 I think so amen
[2:22:37] okay
[2:22:38] yes and I saw heaven opened and behold a
[2:22:42] white horse and he that said upon him
[2:22:45] was called faithful and true and in
[2:22:48] righteousness he do judge and make war
[2:22:51] his eyes were as a flame of fire and on
[2:22:54] his head were many crowns and he had a
[2:22:57] name written that no man knew but he
[2:22:59] himself Hallelujah and he was clothed
[2:23:02] with a vure dipped in Blood and his name
[2:23:05] is called the word of God Amen right
[2:23:10] amen his
[2:23:13] name he has a
[2:23:17] name known only to
[2:23:19] himself
[2:23:24] amen uh if he reveals himself to
[2:23:30] you he is revealing his
[2:23:37] name his name in you becomes a
[2:23:43] revelation that's why when he
[2:23:46] speaks you
[2:23:48] hear amen yes because it's a special
[2:23:56] name okay amen like Abraham you know
[2:24:03] before theing of
[2:24:07] s the Bible says he got up early in the
[2:24:12] morning
[2:24:14] went
[2:24:17] where to the place where he stood before
[2:24:20] the
[2:24:22] [Music]
[2:24:24] Lord amen maybe you understand
[2:24:27] amen
[2:24:29] why
[2:24:31] because in that place God has shown him
[2:24:37] things now every time he would want to
[2:24:42] see the progress
[2:24:45] there or things that are
[2:24:48] happen he went back
[2:24:52] to the place where he stood before the
[2:24:56] Lord and once he arrived
[2:25:00] there he looked and saw
[2:25:04] Sodom but which
[2:25:07] place where he
[2:25:09] stood before the
[2:25:13] Lord amen that's why the Bible
[2:25:17] says uh what the scripture again
[2:25:23] Ephesians
[2:25:26] chapter
[2:25:29] yeah grief not
[2:25:33] the and grief not the holy spirit of God
[2:25:37] whereby you are sealed unto the day of
[2:25:40] redemption whereby you
[2:25:43] are
[2:25:45] oh meaning you are a Sil
[2:25:49] person amen you know
[2:25:54] sealed
[2:25:56] and what if you everything is
[2:26:01] sealed so
[2:26:04] sealed the
[2:26:06] day
[2:26:08] meaning nothing will happen to
[2:26:13] you the day of
[2:26:16] R sealed by
[2:26:19] God
[2:26:21] amen there are people that are sealing
[2:26:24] praise
[2:26:25] God Satan will never
[2:26:30] touch they are
[2:26:33] sealed amen amen you know if there's
[2:26:38] something is
[2:26:39] SE that means it is
[2:26:42] [Music]
[2:26:44] special and it has even a
[2:26:47] stle until it reach the destination
[2:26:52] amen that's why he says you shall not
[2:26:55] die if you believe in
[2:26:58] him because we are
[2:27:04] [Applause]
[2:27:05] sealed Satan is no
[2:27:08] [Music]
[2:27:10] match he was
[2:27:13] defeated Mel kicked him
[2:27:16] down when he rebelled against God
[2:27:21] amen amen but those who
[2:27:24] remained amen these are the spirits of
[2:27:28] God all right let me finish with
[2:27:31] this but did you hear that
[2:27:36] sealed
[2:27:39] until the
[2:27:43] destination now the day of
[2:27:49] redemption how do you know you are
[2:27:52] redeemed because there's a book of
[2:27:57] redemption you should
[2:27:59] know if you are sealed or
[2:28:04] not now the day of
[2:28:07] redemption I find in the
[2:28:10] Bible I think find in the
[2:28:13] spoken that it is the day the book was
[2:28:19] open
[2:28:21] is it the lamb that
[2:28:23] came and took the book from the

[2:29:44] time amen amen so there's a two
[2:29:49] dimension of the
[2:29:53] book but we'll come to a
[2:29:56] place when we will look to the
[2:30:01] right then you'll realize that the book
[2:30:06] from the right hand
[2:30:08] side that if you come
[2:30:11] down you will
[2:30:13] see the
[2:30:16] angel on the right hand
[2:30:18] side we will read

[2:30:57] left it will be a different
[2:31:03] judgment Book of Matthew tell us
[2:31:06] so even right now there are people on
[2:31:11] the right hand
[2:31:12] side people on the
[2:31:14] left amen they don't
[2:31:19] agree

[2:32:19] law
[2:32:21] too much too much
[2:32:25] L
[2:32:26] and we we we always read out of the
[2:32:29] Bible and the
[2:32:35] books the law the children of Israel
[2:32:39] were given
[2:32:41] law and
[2:32:43] afterwards God said they could not keep
[2:32:47] the
[2:32:49] law so he came with
[2:32:54] Grace you know for me and you to be
[2:32:58] called children of God
[2:33:00] today is because he didn't give us
[2:33:04] law he has given us
[2:33:07] [Music]
[2:33:08] [Applause]
[2:33:10] Grace So by Grace not of our
[2:33:15] works but by Grace when I was a
[2:33:19] sinner
[2:33:20] God by his
[2:33:23] grace he saw me as a
[2:33:26] sinner he came to the world to die for
[2:33:31] Sinners he become a
[2:33:35] sacrifice in the form of Jesus
[2:33:38] Christ amen
