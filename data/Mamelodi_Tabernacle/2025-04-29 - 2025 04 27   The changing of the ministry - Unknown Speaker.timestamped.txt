[1:06:14] incarnated yourself amongst us nothing
[1:06:18] is impossible before you Lord
[1:06:22] God we have just seen the endless list
[1:06:26] of the prayer
[1:06:28] requests. Oh father God, may you
[1:06:32] condescend this morning and answer each
[1:06:35] and every request that has brought
[1:06:39] before this pullpit.
[1:06:42] I'm just standing
[1:06:44] here voicing
[1:06:47] out before the voiceless.
[1:06:50] But you know they are hard. Lord God,
[1:06:54] there are others that couldn't make this
[1:06:56] morning to bring their prayer request.
[1:06:59] But you know their heart had desire.
[1:07:02] Lord God, you knew us before the
[1:07:04] foundation of the world. You knew this
[1:07:07] gathering.
[1:07:09] You knew all the activities that will be
[1:07:11] happening this morning. And the Bible
[1:07:14] say you even know the number of our
[1:07:16] hairs. There's nothing that can hit
[1:07:19] before you Lord God. We love you this
[1:07:22] morning. May you bless each and every
[1:07:24] individual Lord God. Amen. is the flesh
[1:07:28] many a time that bothering us. Those
[1:07:31] sickness, those heart desire and

[1:08:13] their heart desire as long as it is not
[1:08:17] against the word of God. Amen.
[1:08:20] Above all, Lord God, may you quicken our
[1:08:23] soul. May you help us to know and to see
[1:08:27] you better each day. Hallelujah. Because
[1:08:30] every moment when we try to go forward,

[1:09:08] better, to see you better this morning.
[1:09:11] And even when the Lord is the word is
[1:09:14] coming forth,
[1:09:16] open our mind, open our heart,
[1:09:20] disintegrate the flesh,
[1:09:23] and the soul shall prevail. Because our
[1:09:26] soul is our real us. We love you so
[1:09:29] much, Lord God. We put everything unto
[1:09:33] your capable hand and give us according
[1:09:36] to thy will. as I put everything Lord
[1:09:39] God unto your capable hand. In the name

[1:27:05] 22 to verse 272.
[1:27:12] Over to you my brother.
[1:27:14] Amen. After
[1:27:18] this, after this things came Jesus and
[1:27:22] his disciples into the land of Judea,
[1:27:25] and there he tried with them and
[1:27:28] baptized. And John also was baptizing in
[1:27:32] Anum near Jerusalem, because there was
[1:27:36] much water there. And they came and were
[1:27:39] baptized, for John was not yet cast into
[1:27:43] prison. Then there arose a question
[1:27:46] between some of John's disciples and the
[1:27:49] Jews about purifying. And they came unto
[1:27:53] John and said unto him, Ravi, he that
[1:27:57] was with thee beyond Jordan, to whom
[1:28:00] thou beest witness, behold the same
[1:28:03] baptizing, and all men came to him. John
[1:28:07] answered and said, A man can receive
[1:28:10] nothing except it be given him from
[1:28:13] heaven. Amen.
[1:28:16] Let us bow our heads.
[1:28:20] Gracious Lord, Amen.
[1:28:23] We are together again. Yes,
[1:28:27] we are here in this tabernacle.
[1:28:31] That reminds us of your disciples.
[1:28:36] Lord, there was a day when they were in
[1:28:39] the upper room.
[1:28:41] They were one mind. Amen. One spirit
[1:28:46] and they were one accord
[1:28:50] and we are here Lord in this tabernacle
[1:28:54] with one accord. Amen. One mind
[1:28:58] and one
[1:29:01] spirit and because of that
[1:29:03] Lord that attract attracted you
[1:29:08] when you see your children
[1:29:11] being one spirit. Yes. And that spirit
[1:29:14] is yours.
[1:29:16] That is why father you came down
[1:29:19] and sat upon each and every one of them
[1:29:24] and they received you
[1:29:26] and you receive them back to yourself.
[1:29:30] And here we are Lord Almighty this
[1:29:33] morning. We invite you Lord that you
[1:29:37] come down and receive us. Amen. so that
[1:29:41] we should receive of yourself.
[1:29:45] No
[1:29:46] man can ever preach to your bride.

[1:29:55] preach to your bride.
[1:29:57] Thank you father. We pray thanking you
[1:30:02] in the precious name of my lord Jesus
[1:30:04] Christ. Amen. Amen.
[1:30:08] Okay, you may be seated. God bless you.
[1:30:15] Uh my
[1:30:18] uh title this morning
[1:30:24] uh is uh the changing of the ministry.
[1:30:36] The changing of the ministry
[1:30:44] Now if I may ask a question,
[1:30:50] where is our ministry right now?
[1:30:56] When we
[1:30:58] say there is a changing of the ministry,
[1:31:00] just write the time
[1:31:07] and then
[1:31:09] changing from what to
[1:31:15] what. I just want us to fellowship about
[1:31:21] that because we we
[1:31:24] can't keep on coming to the
[1:31:32] service and being not in line with what
[1:31:35] is is is happening.
[1:31:41] We must uh have an understanding
[1:31:47] Because we are in a journey.
[1:31:52] We are uh
[1:31:56] uh on a pilgrim,
[1:32:02] right? Amen. Then we should
[1:32:04] know how far are
[1:32:09] we to reach our
[1:32:13] destination and how far are
[1:32:16] we from where we
[1:32:20] started if there ever is any
[1:32:25] start
[1:32:27] because as we move
[1:32:30] on there's a shift ing.
[1:32:34] There is a changing of the
[1:32:38] ministry from one level to
[1:32:42] another from one dimension to
[1:32:46] another. And as the levels are
[1:32:52] changing, there is something that is
[1:32:54] happening to our
[1:32:59] bodies. Amen. There's something that we
[1:33:03] receive. The Bible
[1:33:06] says our mortal
[1:33:10] bodies are
[1:33:14] deteriorating. As our mortal bodies
[1:33:21] deteriorate, there is a new
[1:33:25] man that is built within us.
[1:33:30] Amen. Luke born
[1:33:33] our Lord Jesus Christ,
[1:33:37] the body of our Lord Jesus Christ was
[1:33:40] put in a
[1:33:45] grave. But when
[1:33:48] Mary and the
[1:33:51] disciples went
[1:33:53] there, they find a napkin there.
[1:33:59] The clothing were there,
[1:34:04] but the body was buried there.
[1:34:09] And where was our Lord then?
[1:34:13] He was uh on the way to
[1:34:18] Emos speaking
[1:34:23] with his
[1:34:25] disciples and his disciples were not
[1:34:28] aware
[1:34:32] that he was wearing a
[1:34:35] body and he spoke to
[1:34:38] them. And the only way
[1:34:42] that they could have a knowledge who is
[1:34:45] this
[1:34:47] [Music]
[1:34:49] man was that he took the
[1:34:53] scriptures from
[1:34:57] Moses and as he was
[1:35:02] speaking there was something that was
[1:35:04] built within them.
[1:35:09] Because the Bible
[1:35:11] says there was something that was
[1:35:13] happening to
[1:35:16] them. Now, last time I read the
[1:35:20] scripture. I I I quoted the
[1:35:23] scripture in Isaiah. I think it's 28
[1:35:26] that says 28 precept upon
[1:35:32] precept, line upon
[1:35:35] line, there a little, here a
[1:35:39] little. Now that
[1:35:42] thing when you are
[1:35:44] here in the
[1:35:46] service there's something that is
[1:35:49] building within
[1:35:53] you. You know you know
[1:35:56] Moses said to the children of
[1:36:00] Israel the angel of the Lord
[1:36:04] will always be with you.
[1:36:08] Please be careful.
[1:36:11] Do not disturb
[1:36:13] that. And the Bible says to you,
[1:36:18] the angel of the
[1:36:19] Lord is encamping.
[1:36:25] All right. Amen.
[1:36:27] So now where is our ministry right now?
[1:36:35] Okay. We have read here
[1:36:38] verse 22 says verse 22
[1:36:41] after these things came Jesus and his
[1:36:44] disciples unto the land of
[1:36:50] Judea and there he tried with
[1:36:54] them and and
[1:36:58] baptized. No he terried with them and
[1:37:03] baptized. Right. Amen.
[1:37:06] 23 23 And John also was baptizing.
[1:37:11] [Music]
[1:37:13] Jesus was
[1:37:15] baptized. John was
[1:37:17] baptized. Now it's the changing of the
[1:37:22] ministry. It's another dispensation.
[1:37:26] Jesus
[1:37:28] is now
[1:37:31] taking
[1:37:33] forth. John
[1:37:36] is
[1:37:39] subsiding. The what makes them to
[1:37:43] change. It's a new
[1:37:47] dispensation. Their ministry is not the
[1:37:51] same. Are we together now? As we move
[1:37:56] on, we should be careful of our
[1:38:01] ministry because our ministry
[1:38:04] now has to do with a changing of the
[1:38:10] body, right? It says here now John also
[1:38:15] was
[1:38:18] baptizing why Jesus was baptizing.
[1:38:25] So
[1:38:26] now is the
[1:38:29] crossroad
[1:38:31] junction right? Amen. But the only
[1:38:34] people that understand what was going
[1:38:39] on, it was
[1:38:41] John and Jesus
[1:38:46] because they
[1:38:50] communicated. But on another
[1:38:55] level when John was baptizing
[1:39:00] Jesus, they communed the two of them.
[1:39:04] And when they were
[1:39:07] communing, those that were
[1:39:10] there could not understand their
[1:39:14] Lord because John was
[1:39:18] saying, "I can't baptize
[1:39:22] you." There's something that he
[1:39:26] saw. He saw a
[1:39:28] light. He saw a spirit. He saw a
[1:39:31] promise.
[1:39:34] coming
[1:39:36] down. Amen. So he was forunning
[1:39:40] somebody but he was
[1:39:43] waiting to see who is that man that
[1:39:49] I'm God says this is the
[1:39:53] man and the Bible says
[1:39:57] behold a virgin shall
[1:40:01] conceive and bear a son and his name
[1:40:05] shall be called
[1:40:08] Wonderful
[1:40:10] counselor, the mighty
[1:40:12] God. John knew that he will be the
[1:40:17] mighty
[1:40:20] God. How can he baptize the mighty
[1:40:26] God? That is why he was saying I can't
[1:40:29] baptize
[1:40:31] him. But what did Jesus say?
[1:40:35] Let's do
[1:40:37] it. Let us continue do
[1:40:39] it for the for the sake of the
[1:40:45] word. They they are now
[1:40:48] changing. They are exchanging the
[1:40:51] baiton.
[1:40:57] John is giving the
[1:41:00] baiton to the right
[1:41:02] person and the right
[1:41:04] person take this
[1:41:07] bait. So you must be able that you are
[1:41:10] carrying a
[1:41:13] baiton and what are you supposed to do
[1:41:16] with the bait you are
[1:41:20] having right? Amen. John was baptizing.
[1:41:26] Jesus
[1:41:29] was verse
[1:41:31] 23. And John also was
[1:41:36] baptizing in
[1:41:39] Enim because there was much water
[1:41:43] there and they came
[1:41:47] and were
[1:41:48] baptized. Verse
[1:41:51] 24. For John was not yet cast into
[1:41:55] prison.
[1:42:00] Now remember the
[1:42:03] communication had nothing to do with
[1:42:09] I. It was the
[1:42:11] weight. Our Lord was there to
[1:42:16] confirm the promise, the way it to show
[1:42:21] who he
[1:42:22] is. Because if he says I am so and
[1:42:26] so, somebody will judge
[1:42:29] him because of the history of the
[1:42:32] parents.
[1:42:37] Look, even with you,
[1:42:40] your the prophet says our great
[1:42:49] greatgrandparents were born in
[1:42:53] sins. Now we were also born in
[1:42:58] sin. All of us.
[1:43:02] That's it now. Amen. That's why we had
[1:43:04] to take a new route.
[1:43:08] There was a physical
[1:43:11] birth, a supernatural
[1:43:13] birth. There's a physical
[1:43:16] body and a
[1:43:19] supernatural. There is a physical
[1:43:22] dimension
[1:43:23] dimension, supernatural
[1:43:27] dimension. We have to know that. We have
[1:43:30] to know that now. In which dimension are
[1:43:32] we
[1:43:33] now? In which dispensation are we
[1:43:37] now? In which ministry are we
[1:43:40] now? In which faith are we
[1:43:44] now? Because the Bible says we
[1:43:48] move. We are in a
[1:43:50] journey. We move from faith to
[1:43:55] faith. Right? Amen. Now we should reach
[1:43:59] a
[1:44:00] faith that will change
[1:44:04] our remember
[1:44:08] first Corinthians
[1:44:11] chapter 15 chapter 15 verse 45 says
[1:44:14] verse
[1:44:16] 45 Adam
[1:44:19] was a living soul
[1:44:22] and the second Adam is a quickening of
[1:44:26] spirit
[1:44:28] the spirit that we
[1:44:30] have. It's a quickening
[1:44:33] one. Quickening is the changing of the
[1:44:38] body. There are
[1:44:40] things that will happen around
[1:44:44] us. When
[1:44:46] things which are spiritual things that
[1:44:50] are happening around
[1:44:52] you know that you have won a battle,
[1:44:56] Avenger
[1:44:57] [Music]
[1:45:00] even
[1:45:02] when the signs are showing
[1:45:05] [Music]
[1:45:07] negatively
[1:45:10] slow as a spiritual
[1:45:14] person when he tries to target me
[1:45:20] and the angel of the
[1:45:22] Lord is
[1:45:28] know who you are.
[1:45:41] verse 25.
[1:45:43] Then there arose a
[1:45:59] question. You see the the changing of
[1:46:03] the ministry
[1:46:13] that draws his
[1:46:15] [Music]
[1:46:17] own power of God.
[1:46:25] We have thees
[1:46:30] and
[1:46:33] and we had
[1:46:35] John and we had
[1:46:39] Jesus ministries.
[1:46:59] went to a certain place
[1:47:02] where they worship ancestors.
[1:47:07] So he looked
[1:47:09] around, he
[1:47:12] saw
[1:47:17] their
[1:47:21] such and then they went
[1:47:24] to see are causing
[1:47:28] commotion with your
[1:47:32] ministry. Okay, come
[1:47:35] and tell us about this ministry of
[1:47:39] yours because it's
[1:47:41] confusing. We are helping people
[1:47:44] here in a ministry that we
[1:47:49] confuse now that was moving
[1:47:53] now from one
[1:47:56] [Music]
[1:48:05] child who created
[1:48:15] So when the ministry
[1:48:25] [Music]
[1:48:40] changes Never confuse you.
[1:48:45] You are the citizens.
[1:48:49] You are the
[1:48:52] You are the
[1:48:56] seed. If you come to a
[1:49:00] point where you get
[1:49:03] confused and ask yourself, who am
[1:49:07] I? Why am I confused?
[1:49:11] In that
[1:49:12] moment where the prophet says the word
[1:49:16] is in
[1:49:20] [Music]
[1:49:25] [Music]
[1:49:32] meus hanging on the
[1:49:35] cross. They said there is
[1:49:38] come down. You raise the
[1:49:45] dead. You You
[1:49:48] have You
[1:49:51] multiply. You multiplies.
[1:50:09] in this book.
[1:50:17] 1959
[1:50:30] what
[1:50:40] our
[1:50:41] Lord was on
[1:50:45] his knew what he was doing.
[1:50:50] He was not
[1:50:54] intimidated by the people that says come
[1:51:02] down
[1:51:05] in the
[1:51:14] next one was hanging with him.
[1:51:23] Never
[1:51:24] intimidate child.
[1:51:29] [Music]
[1:51:36] Now
[1:51:39] 26. And they came
[1:51:42] unto
[1:51:46] him that was beyond
[1:51:53] to
[1:51:54] whom bear
[1:51:57] [Music]
[1:52:01] witness the same
[1:52:05] baptis and all men come to him.
[1:52:11] Now
[1:52:16] yesterday people say all men are rushing
[1:52:26] to it
[1:52:29] because of the
[1:52:32] dispensation and it is
[1:52:35] because a prophecy
[1:52:38] is fulfilled.
[1:52:42] When I say the prophecy is fulfilled,
[1:52:46] I
[1:52:47] say
[1:52:55] is it proved for itself.
[1:53:08] I'm doing the right
[1:53:11] thing to be
[1:53:13] done
[1:53:16] because
[1:53:18] theians are following
[1:53:21] the
[1:53:23] prophecy and the manifest.
[1:53:29] You know what the prophet said?
[1:53:35] The
[1:53:55] [Music]
[1:53:59] you let me read you.
[1:54:04] this
[1:54:05] book on the
[1:54:11] seven page.
[1:54:16] It says
[1:54:20] [Music]
[1:54:22] the messenger
[1:54:25] will reveal the mysteries of
[1:54:31] and those who receive that
[1:54:36] prophet in his own will.
[1:54:42] Those that receive
[1:54:46] That prophet
[1:54:48] in his own will
[1:54:52] receive the benefies.
[1:55:18] And those who receive that
[1:55:24] prophet now to receive that
[1:55:27] prophet is not to say.
[1:55:32] Yes.
[1:55:37] To know a person
[1:55:41] is not to know the image.
[1:55:58] So the messenger will reveal the
[1:56:02] mystery of and those who receive that
[1:56:07] prophet in his own
[1:56:11] will the prophet
[1:56:13] in his own will.
[1:56:18] Then you will
[1:56:20] receive the benefit.
[1:56:24] That is the beneficent
[1:56:28] effect of that
[1:56:37] prophet's certain levels of ministry.
[1:56:43] that you will not be
[1:56:46] rich without complying.
[1:56:49] [Music]
[1:56:52] There
[1:56:53] is
[1:56:56] certain of the
[1:56:58] ministry that you will
[1:57:01] not
[1:57:03] receive. Can't reach that
[1:57:07] open
[1:57:16] comp now.
[1:57:19] The Bible says
[1:57:22] men
[1:57:24] come to him.
[1:57:29] There were three
[1:57:40] ministries. Now it
[1:57:42] says when Jesus wasapt
[1:57:51] Now
[1:57:53] what's attracted
[1:57:57] is the
[1:58:09] manifestation of
[1:58:13] it knows that it's certain
[1:58:17] time I'm going to do this.
[1:58:29] You don't go there by your
[1:58:36] intents
[1:58:41] right that's how
[1:58:44] is the
[1:58:46] faithful that's
[1:58:51] God said, "Let us make
[1:58:54] [Music]
[1:58:55] man after
[1:58:58] our
[1:59:02] says
[1:59:08] that
[1:59:10] somebody can manifest
[1:59:13] it in.
[1:59:20] He believed
[1:59:22] that the word must be disbelieved in the
[1:59:25] garden
[1:59:27] of
[1:59:35] men. Let it
[1:59:41] be like that.
[1:59:44] And the bride said, "Let it be."
[1:59:55] And the prophet says,
[2:00:00] "There
[2:00:06] is once you receive it,
[2:00:10] the level of faith goes up.
[2:00:17] change because there's a dimension that
[2:00:23] is a certain
[2:00:26] dimension. So now there's something that
[2:00:33] [Music]
[2:00:37] is never the same.
[2:00:46] The doors are closed.
[2:00:51] You couldn't
[2:00:52] come. Sorry. No, I I came by
[2:00:59] mistake. There's no way that you could
[2:01:01] do a wrong thing.
[2:01:05] The pastor was
[2:01:07] saying his brother
[2:01:12] with his
[2:01:13] [Music]
[2:01:18] friend to the
[2:01:21] house and then funeral
[2:01:26] you
[2:01:27] know I don't know what you call it where
[2:01:30] you identify the cops
[2:01:36] move on when they come their time come
[2:01:40] They open up my shoes.
[2:01:49] No, it's not you.
[2:01:59] So there won't be a mistake with you.
[2:02:16] your heaven.
[2:02:30] So now you see how powerful was his
[2:02:33] ministry.
[2:02:37] very that very same
[2:02:40] ministry is of Jesus.
[2:02:43] It's of Christ.
[2:02:45] That is what we call
[2:02:51] these
[2:02:55] ministry of
[2:02:57] the preacher.
[2:03:00] No, he said follow me.
[2:03:09] never and when you preach in
[2:03:13] parable in the afternoon
[2:03:16] evening then you
[2:03:19] relax
[2:03:21] and sleep on
[2:03:25] his
[2:03:27] starting and then we say why do you
[2:03:31] preach in parable
[2:03:35] us.
[2:03:48] Hallelujah. When we preach in
[2:03:52] the
[2:03:59] preach and preach and when he brings the
[2:04:03] ministry home and preach
[2:04:10] [Music]
[2:04:15] Jesus will visit me.
[2:04:19] Martha
[2:04:21] and Lazarus.
[2:04:23] And one of the
[2:04:24] sisters will sit on his
[2:04:27] feet and listen and
[2:04:32] grumble and then the other one will
[2:04:34] grumble.
[2:04:36] [Music]
[2:04:39] She was sitting
[2:04:40] [Music]
[2:04:45] there and when she was sitting there she
[2:04:49] was hearing words from the
[2:04:56] temple. Amen.
[2:05:03] [Music]
[2:05:19] [Music]
[2:05:23] There's a
[2:05:24] dimension
[2:05:29] called dimension
[2:05:34] called and there's a place
[2:05:42] Dimension
[2:05:45] Dimension Dimension.
[2:05:58] [Music]
[2:06:03] There
[2:06:04] was I was reading where it says a man
[2:06:08] come to
[2:06:10] him and then what did Jesus
[2:06:16] say John answered and
[2:06:19] said man can receive
[2:06:25] nothing except
[2:06:32] [Music]
[2:06:34] given
[2:06:36] nothing except
[2:06:39] it's
[2:06:45] given you a heavenly
[2:06:50] [Music]
[2:06:53] let's read uh the book of Romans
[2:06:59] Before we read that, let me give you
[2:07:03] another example.
[2:07:06] You
[2:07:10] [Music]
[2:07:17] know, there was a
[2:07:22] time Remember
[2:07:45] [Music]
[2:07:51] that's what you
[2:07:56] Meditate.
[2:07:58] Don'tate your challenges.
[2:08:17] As long as we are in
[2:08:28] this Amen.
[2:08:32] [Music]
[2:08:33] [Applause]
[2:08:39] Amen.
[2:08:41] The book of Daniel
[2:08:47] Daniel in the third year of the reign of
[2:08:51] Jehovah king of Judah
[2:08:58] came and
[2:09:00] besieed and the Lord gave king of Judah
[2:09:04] into his hand with part of the desert of
[2:09:08] the house of God
[2:09:10] into the land
[2:09:19] of chapter
[2:09:31] 9. In the first year of the son of
[2:09:35] Abus of the state of the which was made
[2:09:40] king over the realm of
[2:09:43] the
[2:09:50] ins of the Lord came to Jeremiah the
[2:09:54] prophet that he will accomplish 70 years
[2:09:58] in the desation of Jerusalem.
[2:10:05] [Music]
[2:10:09] When
[2:10:12] was supposed to be taken?
[2:10:28] So was that you would
[2:10:32] be taken
[2:10:40] There was nothing that could
[2:10:43] [Music]
[2:10:44] preach. The ministry
[2:10:48] was going
[2:11:13] to tell them that they going
[2:11:16] out the ministry of the seven seed.
[2:11:21] There's nothing else that is to tell you
[2:11:24] that your body's been quickened.
[2:11:28] There's nothing else that you could
[2:11:31] preach is the
[2:11:34] quickening. Right? Amen. And when Daniel
[2:11:40] was in Egypt and he was in Babylon,
[2:11:44] he was the prophet there
[2:11:47] and then he was
[2:11:49] reading the books going on reading the
[2:11:52] books.
[2:11:55] Now read verse two. Verse two. The first
[2:11:58] year of his reign, I Daniel understood
[2:12:01] by books the number of the years. Yes,
[2:12:04] he understood by books.
[2:12:08] He
[2:12:09] read the books
[2:12:11] of of of the prophet
[2:12:15] Jeremiah that
[2:12:18] tells that now we need to go
[2:12:21] out. We we we read and we still
[2:12:26] reading the books that says at the end
[2:12:32] time this is what going to happen. And
[2:12:35] we know that we are at the end
[2:12:37] time. Daniel was in
[2:12:40] Babylon, but he
[2:12:42] knew it's the end of
[2:12:46] slavery. We have to go
[2:12:48] home. It was a
[2:12:51] prophecy. He believed that
[2:12:55] prophet. He read the
[2:12:58] books and then from there on he
[2:13:02] understood. You see when he understood
[2:13:07] he went to pray.
[2:13:10] Now the
[2:13:13] prayer was relevant
[2:13:17] to what was
[2:13:20] happening there. There is no
[2:13:22] way that
[2:13:24] God could not answer
[2:13:29] you when you pray
[2:13:35] relevantly and there's no
[2:13:37] way that God cannot bless
[2:13:40] you when when you are
[2:13:44] embraced by the relevant
[2:13:48] ministry because you're doing what God
[2:13:50] says.
[2:13:52] do. And when you're doing what God
[2:13:55] says, God is bound to answer
[2:13:59] you. He's bound to answer your
[2:14:03] request. He's bound to answer your your
[2:14:07] your your
[2:14:11] prayer. That's why when
[2:14:13] Daniel went to the river with his
[2:14:17] friends to go and pray, he was certain
[2:14:21] that is right.
[2:14:25] You see? Amen.
[2:14:28] So he knew that I am
[2:14:30] right and he
[2:14:33] knew that he was talking to
[2:14:36] God. And you know what the the Bible
[2:14:39] says?
[2:14:41] It says, "Let your
[2:14:44] prayer be heard."
[2:14:48] When you pray, let your prayer reach the
[2:14:54] destination. You don't pray because
[2:14:56] you're supposed to pray.
[2:15:00] You pray because you want to speak to
[2:15:02] your
[2:15:03] father and you know that your prayer
[2:15:08] will reach this
[2:15:10] destination only your father will answer
[2:15:14] you will not you don't say
[2:15:17] maybe you know when you
[2:15:21] pray talking to your father
[2:15:24] right amen now the ministry of
[2:15:28] Daniel when he was at the
[2:15:30] river praying. He was with
[2:15:34] friends. Some of them
[2:15:39] there was the ones that that accompanied
[2:15:43] him, they were just accompanying them
[2:15:46] because when the angel
[2:15:47] came, they ran away.
[2:15:52] How can when when God comes
[2:15:54] you and you were praying all this
[2:15:57] time God answer
[2:16:00] us? Here we are Lord. And the Lord comes
[2:16:04] and then you run away.
[2:16:07] Right? And it was only
[2:16:10] Daniel that
[2:16:12] remained and
[2:16:14] hate. Remember when when when
[2:16:18] [Music]
[2:16:20] when uh
[2:16:22] Paul when he was still
[2:16:25] Saul, he was on his way, Jesus
[2:16:29] came. They all fell down. Some ran away.
[2:16:32] Jesus was
[2:16:35] coming. They ran
[2:16:37] away because it was not their
[2:16:40] ministry. The dispensation was of
[2:16:45] Paul. When Jesus came, go straight to
[2:16:48] Paul and say, "Paul, Paul,
[2:16:52] s why persecute
[2:16:56] me." So there was a communication
[2:17:00] between
[2:17:03] Saul and Jesus. So when the the the the
[2:17:07] the heavens
[2:17:09] open, the seven angels came
[2:17:13] down. Seven
[2:17:15] angels that came down. You know that
[2:17:18] your angel was
[2:17:20] there. Angel was
[2:17:23] there. Now you can't refuse your angel.
[2:17:30] We have this
[2:17:33] photo of those seven
[2:17:35] angels in our
[2:17:38] homes. Why are we displaying
[2:17:41] that? Because we are
[2:17:43] there. That is part that is part of
[2:17:48] us. Amen. And when I'm there, I'm
[2:17:52] supernatural.
[2:17:57] One day I was visited by a
[2:18:00] sister at home. When she came in, she
[2:18:04] said, "Take out that phone." And she
[2:18:06] started
[2:18:07] rolling. Prayer
[2:18:09] didn't just look at that phone. No, no,
[2:18:12] no, no,
[2:18:13] no. Because the fire, the logos is
[2:18:18] there.
[2:18:20] But it all
[2:18:21] depends whether you have it in
[2:18:25] yourself because you are part of
[2:18:29] it. There's a
[2:18:31] connection with you with those seven
[2:18:35] angels. Those seven
[2:18:37] angels is your
[2:18:39] theophony. And now when we preach is
[2:18:44] that
[2:18:45] theophony it's a communication.
[2:18:50] That is why it's not come to
[2:18:53] Jesus. That is why right now if somebody
[2:18:57] doesn't want to to the line you give him
[2:18:59] the word the word will grind
[2:19:03] him will work on
[2:19:05] him. There is life in the word. Jesus
[2:19:10] says the words that I
[2:19:13] speak. They are spirit and they are
[2:19:18] alive those words are spirit and they
[2:19:21] are alive and they will go for their
[2:19:26] own and and
[2:19:30] pull unto themselves.
[2:19:35] Are we together?
[2:19:37] Jeremiah's message
[2:19:40] was in uh was a a
[2:19:47] dispensation. So but when it reaches
[2:19:53] Babylon, it became another
[2:19:56] ministry and pulled them
[2:19:59] back to the promised
[2:20:02] land. That is why now Romans 11:17 says
[2:20:07] there, let's go to Romans 1:17.
[2:20:11] So I I
[2:20:15] think you you should know
[2:20:19] that now the
[2:20:21] changing of the ministry.
[2:20:26] Uh it lines up
[2:20:29] with a a a particular dispensation
[2:20:35] and and also the level of your faith.
[2:20:39] It changes your
[2:20:42] faith. Amen. You know there's a a
[2:20:45] wavering
[2:20:48] faith and then there is a faith that has
[2:20:52] reached the
[2:20:55] destination. That's that's why the
[2:20:57] prophet speaks
[2:20:59] about the sixth
[2:21:03] sense. I've got five
[2:21:06] senses. But there's another
[2:21:08] one which is the sixth
[2:21:11] one. When that
[2:21:13] one, it's always reach. It's to the
[2:21:20] point once you move away from
[2:21:23] it, you
[2:21:25] think. Jesus said to Peter, he was
[2:21:28] walking upon the sea. He said, "Came,
[2:21:32] come, come, come.
[2:21:34] Peter
[2:21:36] faithfully faithfully walk.
[2:21:40] But once the faith start
[2:21:43] wevering and on now keep the
[2:21:48] faith because the Bible says we move
[2:21:51] from let's read it. Let's read it here.
[2:21:55] I say chapter one.
[2:21:57] Yes. Let's read
[2:22:00] uh what from verse uh 16h. Amen.
[2:22:07] For I am not ashamed of the gospel of
[2:22:10] Christ. For it is the power of God unto
[2:22:13] salvation to everyone that believeth.
[2:22:16] Amen. To the Jew first and also to the
[2:22:18] Greek. Listen to verse 17.
[2:22:21] 17. For therein is the righteousness of
[2:22:24] God revealed from faith to faith. As it
[2:22:28] is written, the just shall live by
[2:22:30] faith. Amen. Now it says the righteous
[2:22:33] of
[2:22:34] God is
[2:22:38] revealed from
[2:22:40] faith to faith. You move
[2:22:44] on. It
[2:22:46] shoots from one faith
[2:22:52] on until you enter new
[2:22:55] Jerusalem. pushes you
[2:23:00] right let's read again I want to read
[2:23:02] these scriptures then I will comment
[2:23:06] uh let's go to the book of first
[2:23:09] Corinthians
[2:23:13] uh and and let's read also verse 17 if
[2:23:17] if I've got it right verse 17 first
[2:23:21] Corinthians
[2:23:24] verse seven chapter 9. Sorry. Chapter 9.
[2:23:27] Chapter 9. Verse 17. Verse 17.
[2:23:32] Let's read it to you, brother.
[2:23:35] For if I do this thing willingly, I have
[2:23:38] a reward. But if against my will, a
[2:23:42] dispensation of the gospel is committed
[2:23:45] unto me.
[2:23:47] Now, it says here,
[2:23:51] uh, I want you to listen carefully.
[2:23:56] says
[2:24:00] is it chapter nine my brother? Amen.
[2:24:03] Verse six verse 17. Yes. For if I do
[2:24:08] this thing
[2:24:12] willingly I have a
[2:24:15] reward. That's what Paul says.
[2:24:21] And there's a hyphen there.
[2:24:26] It shows that it's not uh that sentence
[2:24:29] is not finished.
[2:24:32] It's
[2:24:34] still continuing. Amen.
[2:24:39] But if against my
[2:24:45] will, a dispensation of the gospel is
[2:24:49] committed unto me.
[2:24:58] Now Paul
[2:25:00] was chosen
[2:25:03] to a youth
[2:25:05] dispensation dispensation.
[2:25:07] Now when he is chosen to that
[2:25:12] dispensation whether it's his
[2:25:15] will or not he has been chosen for that
[2:25:21] dispensation. Look if if if I was chosen
[2:25:26] to be coana
[2:25:30] Even if I will admire and want to
[2:25:36] be I want I'm chosen to
[2:25:41] be. Now if you are
[2:25:45] chosen to be the bride of
[2:25:49] Christ, you won't
[2:25:52] change. The relevant
[2:25:55] things, the relevant
[2:25:59] promises will be
[2:26:01] yours. And there won't come a
[2:26:05] time where it
[2:26:09] dist. No.
[2:26:12] You will know them. You know what?
[2:26:14] Brother Brenham, brother Brennham went
[2:26:16] to the sixth dimension.
[2:26:19] He met
[2:26:21] people. They knew each
[2:26:24] other in a different
[2:26:29] dimension. They were not
[2:26:34] surprised. Look, we come from one point.
[2:26:39] We were in the mind of
[2:26:41] God. We were
[2:26:43] together in the mind of God. The Bible
[2:26:47] says he is the
[2:26:50] rock. You can't turn
[2:26:53] away from the rock from which you
[2:26:57] come
[2:27:00] together and together the Lord would
[2:27:04] come. What is going to happen in new
[2:27:08] Jerusalem?
[2:27:11] It what was happening before we come to
[2:27:16] this it speak
[2:27:19] about the the
[2:27:22] water the river of
[2:27:26] life and the water of life.
[2:27:30] It speaks about the
[2:27:33] tree that will bear
[2:27:37] fruit and that water of
[2:27:40] life coming right from the throne of
[2:27:45] God. And
[2:27:47] Jesus said to the Samaritan woman, "Give
[2:27:51] me water to drink." She said, "No, you
[2:27:53] are a Jew."
[2:27:56] And then he said, "If you
[2:27:58] knew who is this
[2:28:00] man, I will give you a
[2:28:03] water that when you drink it, you will
[2:28:07] never thirst." We are going to a place
[2:28:11] where now the life that comes from his
[2:28:16] throne, we will
[2:28:18] always give us life.
[2:28:21] those that will be out of New
[2:28:24] Jerusalem. They will come into that
[2:28:27] tree and take a
[2:28:30] fruit. It's not a
[2:28:34] physical is the
[2:28:37] life. When I want to have a discussion
[2:28:40] with
[2:28:41] God, I want to
[2:28:44] walk and go into his
[2:28:47] throne. He won't walk and come to where
[2:28:50] we are.
[2:28:51] We just meet
[2:28:54] when God in the garden of Eden was
[2:28:59] coming to to to to Adam. He didn't
[2:29:04] walk. Neither was Adam
[2:29:06] walking. Adam saw
[2:29:09] God. Are you
[2:29:11] aware that right now God is in
[2:29:16] you? You are and you are communicating
[2:29:19] with God on daily
[2:29:21] [Music]
[2:29:23] basis. You don't walk and go to
[2:29:25] him. Neither do you walk and go to him.
[2:29:29] You are one in the same
[2:29:31] thing. That is why Jesus said I and my
[2:29:38] father. Right. Amen. And when Philip
[2:29:41] said, "Show us the father said, "Philip,
[2:29:45] when you see me, you see the father."
[2:29:48] Finishing. Amen. When you see the bride,
[2:29:52] you see the
[2:29:54] father. Because the father is the word.
[2:29:57] In the beginning was the word was with
[2:30:00] God. The word is God. The word is now in
[2:30:04] you. The father is now in you.
[2:30:10] Now the
[2:30:13] enjoyment that we'll be
[2:30:15] having is the very enjoyment that we are
[2:30:19] having. The only difference is
[2:30:23] that we won't remember this. He said it
[2:30:27] won't be remembered. The past won't be
[2:30:31] remembered because it will
[2:30:34] joy. Unspeakable joy.
[2:30:39] Now, how can
[2:30:42] you claim
[2:30:44] to be the
[2:30:47] citizen of New Jerusalem? Jerusalem, why
[2:30:51] you don't have
[2:30:53] joy? Why you hate each
[2:30:56] other? Why you gossip about each
[2:30:59] other? Why you don't see the relevance
[2:31:02] of the
[2:31:04] way? It's your way.
[2:31:07] Look what is the
[2:31:10] church. The church is the Holy
[2:31:13] Ghost. The church is
[2:31:15] yours. You are the
[2:31:17] church. When God want to
[2:31:21] relax and and commune, he commune with
[2:31:24] you. There's nobody else. He just put a
[2:31:27] thirst in
[2:31:29] you. And then you think, "No, I must go
[2:31:31] to my room. I must go and
[2:31:34] pray down and say
[2:31:37] Lord start talking with your
[2:31:39] God. Talking with your God. Even at
[2:31:42] night, what can wake you up? You won't
[2:31:46] hear a hand
[2:31:47] shaking. It is yourself.
[2:31:54] Say rather let me
[2:31:56] pray. Rather, let me
[2:31:59] read. God shook you up. And when you
[2:32:02] read there, he will show you what to
[2:32:08] read. So you are with God
[2:32:15] 24/7 27. 24/7 you are with God
[2:32:19] 247. Right. Amen. Don't
[2:32:22] ever entertain
[2:32:28] negativity. Stay positive.
[2:32:32] That's why the prophet says you got to
[2:32:36] watch what man
[2:32:39] says and what God says. God gave you a
[2:32:44] promise. God gave you a good
[2:32:47] life. God gave you, you know,
[2:32:53] everything. He gave you joy. Is the
[2:32:56] devil that want to take your joy?
[2:32:59] God gave you whatever it is.
[2:33:03] [Music]
[2:33:08] Are we together?
[2:33:10] So now when we change
[2:33:14] from this
[2:33:16] dispensation there will be another
[2:33:20] ministry changing of the
[2:33:22] ministry. That's why now
[2:33:26] Isaiah 28 28 from verse 19 it says
[2:33:31] precept
[2:33:34] upon precept. Amen. You go to Philip
[2:33:38] chapter 4 verse 6 verse 6 he says let
[2:33:42] your request be
[2:33:46] known when you pray your
[2:33:49] God let your
[2:33:53] request right amen
[2:33:56] the prophet says in the book of
[2:34:01] seals in paragraph 233 paragraph 233 He
[2:34:06] says everything runs out in this
[2:34:12] time. Is the end of church
[2:34:15] ages the end of the
[2:34:18] seven, the ends of the
[2:34:21] trumpets, the end of the
[2:34:23] v in the end
[2:34:27] of into the
[2:34:29] [Music]
[2:34:31] minia. Amen.
[2:34:34] Uh let me have that. Uh
[2:34:38] uh I think I've got
[2:34:42] uh what you call brother brothers the
[2:34:46] the what I want to display
[2:34:49] here. That's the three and a half I'm in
[2:34:52] the 70th week of Daniel. I think I've
[2:34:56] got it there. The 70th week. I just want
[2:34:59] to say something about
[2:35:01] tongue is t is tighter. Yeah.
[2:35:06] Yeah. That's the one. Amen. That's the
[2:35:08] one.
[2:35:10] Now the left. The one on your left.
[2:35:15] No. No. The one on your on your right.
[2:35:17] You are facing that side. Me. Me. It's
[2:35:20] my
[2:35:20] left.
[2:35:22] Abraham. Abraham.
[2:35:25] Those are the Jews. Yeah. doing good
[2:35:28] thing to show it. Amen. They were
[2:35:30] waiting for the Messiah.
[2:35:33] Right on top. There's an X there.
[2:35:37] He came as the son of
[2:35:42] man. But God
[2:35:45] blinded the eyes of the
[2:35:48] Jews so that we could be
[2:35:52] crafted. Come to the Gentiles, my
[2:35:55] friend. And we're given
[2:35:58] the first, the
[2:36:01] second up to the
[2:36:07] second church age and then
[2:36:10] thereafter we cross over to the
[2:36:15] sea you see now. So now what is what
[2:36:18] what's next to
[2:36:20] come is the
[2:36:22] rapture. There we are. We go.
[2:36:25] Now we cannot go to the rapture with
[2:36:28] this
[2:36:30] body and we are in that
[2:36:33] ministry that prepares
[2:36:35] us to
[2:36:38] go. The ministry has to
[2:36:41] do with a
[2:36:44] change. Are we together? Amen. That is
[2:36:47] the seven. Now
[2:36:51] the pyramid
[2:36:53] has been kept.
[2:36:56] That is why now the pastor is always on
[2:37:00] that
[2:37:02] pyramid. He says you are the
[2:37:06] pyramid pyramid. So when he says you
[2:37:10] talking
[2:37:11] about your theophanes,
[2:37:17] somebody said unto
[2:37:19] me, you people say God
[2:37:25] is in
[2:37:26] you. Meanwhile, the Bible
[2:37:28] says he will
[2:37:32] descend. Now, how
[2:37:34] come that is in you? Because the Bible
[2:37:39] says he will
[2:37:42] descend. They miss one
[2:37:45] thing. The prophet
[2:37:47] says that God is God is potentially in
[2:37:52] you.
[2:37:56] in the form of the
[2:37:58] word because the Bible says in the
[2:38:01] beginning was the word. The word was
[2:38:03] with God. The word was God. The word was
[2:38:08] God in you. In the form of the word.
[2:38:14] But now one
[2:38:16] day
[2:38:17] God in the form of the
[2:38:21] image he
[2:38:23] will come down. The word that is
[2:38:28] here is his
[2:38:31] part. Are you together? He will come to
[2:38:34] to to come and fetch the
[2:38:37] word but it will be in the
[2:38:40] sky. Now that word is the one that
[2:38:45] pulled off the napkins and
[2:38:49] the word when they went to the
[2:38:53] grave. It was not
[2:38:55] there. Are we together? Amen. And that
[2:38:58] word will leave this planet
[2:39:02] earth and will leave the
[2:39:05] world and somebody else will come and
[2:39:08] take over.
[2:39:11] You see the
[2:39:14] prophet will always touch these three
[2:39:16] things.
[2:39:19] He will touch the white house. The white
[2:39:22] house the white house which is in
[2:39:25] America.
[2:39:27] And he will touch
[2:39:29] the Kremlin
[2:39:32] which is in Moscow Moscow. And he will
[2:39:35] touch the Vatican
[2:39:38] which is in Rome.
[2:39:41] You
[2:39:42] see the people that control this world
[2:39:46] is the white house
[2:39:48] is the Kremlin
[2:39:51] is the Vatican.
[2:39:55] Now the prophet says the Kremlin
[2:39:59] will destroy
[2:40:02] the White House White House and the
[2:40:04] Vatican
[2:40:06] and the government will be one.
[2:40:12] Because he says, "Watch Russia,
[2:40:16] king of the north."
[2:40:19] He says, "A king of the north."
[2:40:22] He will destroy the Vatican.
[2:40:27] Now, what what is that?
[2:40:30] It's one and the same thing. They
[2:40:33] prepare it
[2:40:35] together and destroy the
[2:40:39] unwanted then it would be a new
[2:40:41] covenant. Let's let's come to that what
[2:40:44] you call right now after the
[2:40:48] rapture. Then the ministry goes to the
[2:40:51] now from 1 to
[2:40:55] 7 he is here in the form of the Holy
[2:40:59] Spirit.
[2:41:02] and he is the son of
[2:41:05] God. But you go up to the red part
[2:41:09] where the seven
[2:41:12] seals then the ministry
[2:41:14] changes from the seven church
[2:41:17] ages to the seals. Then he becomes
[2:41:21] now son
[2:41:24] of the revealed
[2:41:27] word is the son of man that kept still
[2:41:30] there.
[2:41:32] is the son of man. The ministry of the
[2:41:35] son of man will rapture us.
[2:41:40] That son of man that was in the Jews.
[2:41:47] The other one on the left, my brother.
[2:41:50] That one? No, no, no. That one. Yeah,
[2:41:52] that one was rejected. After the
[2:41:56] rapture, you will come over
[2:41:58] here. Right. Right. Right on the right
[2:42:01] one. That's it. Amen. That's where
[2:42:04] now to the Jews because God blinded
[2:42:08] them. We could be
[2:42:11] crowned. Are we together now? And then
[2:42:15] after our
[2:42:16] rapture, there's the battle of go
[2:42:21] and right after that
[2:42:24] battle and actually after the
[2:42:28] rapture is the song that you
[2:42:31] sing, behold, I'll send you Elijah the
[2:42:34] [Music]
[2:42:36] prophet before the great and dreadful
[2:42:38] day
[2:42:41] of after the rapture.
[2:42:44] starts the great and dreadful
[2:42:48] death. Moses
[2:42:51] came and preached to the Jews. Moses and
[2:42:54] Elijah only
[2:42:57] 144,000. Amen. That will
[2:43:01] repent then that will be the rapture of
[2:43:04] the
[2:43:05] Jews because Moses and Elijah will be
[2:43:09] killed will lie on the
[2:43:12] street days and then a voice will call
[2:43:16] them from
[2:43:17] heaven captured. Then there comes the
[2:43:20] battle of
[2:43:23] Armageddon. Then after the battle of
[2:43:25] Armageddon, then it's back to the garden
[2:43:28] of
[2:43:29] Eden which is millennia.
[2:43:33] Are we together? Now we had such as Yes.
[2:43:37] Paul says,
[2:43:39] he says we've got great
[2:43:43] promises. The promises that we have. I
[2:43:46] like that
[2:43:47] scripture. Let me read it so that I
[2:43:50] should
[2:43:52] close. It's it's the book of second
[2:43:54] Peter
[2:43:58] chapter one chapter one verse
[2:44:02] four verse four whilst you are bringing
[2:44:06] the prophet speaks about the stars of
[2:44:11] heaven on revelation we'll do that next
[2:44:15] week I mean
[2:44:17] sometime when we've got time read it
[2:44:20] verse four whereby are given and unto us
[2:44:24] exceeding great and precious promises.
[2:44:27] Look what he says,
[2:44:33] great and
[2:44:35] precious great.
[2:44:38] Look, brother or sister, you have
[2:44:43] great and precious
[2:44:50] promises that by these you might be the
[2:44:54] pac of the
[2:44:56] divine nature.

[2:45:03] promises that will give you will take
[2:45:07] out the nature
[2:45:10] and give you the
[2:45:13] divine

[2:45:33] song? Uh maybe you might not know
[2:45:38] it. There's a

[2:50:57] up to that level that used to meet with
[2:51:00] you. You were you were already
[2:51:05] changed.
[2:51:32] for your angel was here once again in
[2:51:35] this pulpit.
[2:51:37] There is an
[2:51:39] angel in this
[2:51:42] pullpit. When the pastor
[2:51:45] said the elder so and so is going to
[2:51:48] preach is just as the same. When Elza go
[2:51:53] and look for
[2:51:55] Rebecca
[2:51:56] Elza the angel of Abraham. Abraham there
[2:52:00] was an angel.
[2:52:14] It was
[2:52:20] impossible. I
[2:52:26] 318 thousands and thousands.
[2:52:38] Gater is he that is in you than the one
[2:52:42] who is in the
[2:52:44] world. One child of
[2:52:47] God. All hell can
[2:52:50] come. It will never defeat him or her
[2:52:55] because all heaven is in that child of
[2:52:57] God.
[2:53:01] We
[2:53:04] know as the pastor
[2:53:07] said go and preach. He was directing
[2:53:11] that
[2:53:13] angel. He must go and use the disco
[2:53:17] today. Father God, we are
[2:53:20] blessed to have a God like you. You
[2:53:24] think about us.
[2:53:26] You look after us. You love us.
[2:53:30] No matter how the devil can hate us, but
[2:53:35] Father God, we are so happy because you
[2:53:38] love
[2:53:39] us. You are preparing us for the rapture
[2:53:43] now. Is our time to go home now
[2:53:54] because
[2:54:08] Our luggage are ready. We are ready to
[2:54:14] go. Anytime the rapture can
[2:54:17] come, the pastor has said this many
[2:54:20] times. We are going home. He has
[2:54:24] preached
[2:54:25] everything. No one can preach to this
[2:54:28] bride again unless your angel can come
[2:54:30] like today and preach to
[2:54:33] us. Only the special
[2:54:39] ministry because is the time to going
[2:54:42] home. Bless our elder. Bless our
[2:54:46] pastor that divine
[2:54:52] healing because always when he choose
[2:54:55] somebody to come this pullpit we become
[2:55:00] blessed to connect us with your angel
[2:55:03] once again. Thank you Lord in the name
[2:55:05] of Jesus Christ we pray. Amen. Amen.
[2:55:14] God bless you
[2:55:16] saints. You may take your seat.
[2:55:22] Thank you. May the Lord richly bless
[2:55:26] you. Can you turn to your neighbor and
[2:55:28] just say God bless
[2:55:32] you. Amen. Amen.
