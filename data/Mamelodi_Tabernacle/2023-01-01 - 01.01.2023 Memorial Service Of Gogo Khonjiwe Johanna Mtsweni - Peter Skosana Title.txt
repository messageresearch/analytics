I mean chapter 3 verse 16 and 17. with chapter 3 verse 16. you know 17. now the Bible says here if I have a little upper oh sorry uh and Jesus when he was baptized went up straight out of the water and lo the heavens were opened unto him and he saw the spirit of God descending like a dove and lighting upon him and lo a voice from Heaven saying this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased now here we heard Jesus now when he was he was born like anybody but now the day he was taken to the temple uh there was a priest today guava Kono priest and that that priest loyan priest was told by the holy spirit that he will not die um so when the mothers were bringing in their children in the temple a temple to be circumcised and to be blessed way it was different mothers real and then different children but that priest when he took our Lord Jesus Christ that very same spirit that he told him that he will not die until he sees it anointed him that Spirit fell upon him then he started prophesying Prophet no it was a long queue um he was saying to the people this is the messiah now people that knew Maria abandoned umaria were surprised because they know the story behind Maria and this child all right together amen now he started blessing the child prophesy and did his job when some service work but what I want you to notice is as we're talking about the two Natures you've got two Natures in yourself and then when and the prophet says when a mother is expecting a child um now there's also that's a there's a body in her room and then there's also another poetifuch in the form of the spirit that one to occupy that board as soon as that body is is born of there's a spirit that needs to come into that food foreign [Music] the prophet calls it a little angel um that needs to occupy that body is then he says the nature of that woman would change you you look at any woman when she's expecting a child [Music] and nature changes and then when the child is born um and that Spirit comes into that child now that spirit it's a spirit Moya I would say it's a temporary Spirit pending on the predestination when that spirit is born um it takes the nature of the female or um when that child is born that child takes the nature of the famous it takes the nature of his father and his mother are we together amen now as he or she grows then there is another body if that will come gradually to him in the form of the word of God All Souls when he hears the word of God is okay foreign I'd like us to read verse 16. over 16. it says the spirit itself buried witness with our spirit that we are the children of God so now speaking about the two Spirits says the spirit itself parrot witness with our spirit that we are the children of course there is a spirit that keeps your body alive but there's a spirit that will come over oza uh change the Natural Spirit that is in you also you won't have two bodies one for the natural Spirits another one for The Supernaturals those two spirits will come and live in you the other spirit will keep the body alive but the other spirit will prepare you so that when your spirit leaves you you'll be having another boat can I repeat myself speaking about the two Natures that were fighting in him your natural Spirit once the natural things now he speaks about the things that he wants to do let me let me go back to it again [Music] um that was in The Book of Romans chapter 7 amen now verse 15 says 15 UTI for that which I do I allow not located now if there's something that he do mind you um which is not right it come by itself because you need a spirit that will stop that thing within you also for what I would I would that I do not look what I hate that I do foreign leave him alone no this man was drunk waiting for my glory and don't you know what discussing about flowers and he's telling me to leave that one and we are discussing flowers and I know imagine yes I want strength also naming when you have real real drunk um you tell yourself I will never never touch a bottle in my life but within three days you'll be drunk and vagins was entire Tuesday and then you won't know why are you drunk you may not even know why are you drinking anything you're saying that I want to quit smoking [Music] this but the last one is the last one but you'll find yourself having a packet yeah because you have another nature in you that drives you to do those things you want to do away with each but you don't have any power this this nature is overpowering you God are we together amen oh the prophet always says if you take any road um Prophet UTI um uh or two Natures or two atmospheres two signs anything you want to uh there is Jesus right in the middle so Jesus Christ is in the middle um it depends on which direction are you taking but he's standing here so it all depends with which nature each and everyone came and made a sacrifice now each and every sacrifice that was made uh it was done by a revelation that was in that specific individuals it it was their their their sacrifice were was contrary to each other how are we together amen okay fine let's come to ourselves we've been worshiping God we've been saying the Lord is coming everybody says the Lord is coming and then but now are you aware that you are facing two directions you say we are going to heaven you must reach heavenly you must not walk eternally until you are going to happen say the Lord is coming um you must be able to pinpoint where he is you can you cannot just say he is coming yes not knowing where he is I always say when I was traveling from where I stay um and I must see myself I must know that now I am into a fun day in Maryland but it doesn't mean that because I must look until I am at the right house now when we worship God we must come to a point where we know exactly where he is then we must know how far is he finances is he from us if we don't know that um that is why the Bible speaks about the Rapture it says it's a sacred Rapture now if it's a sacred one um we cannot not worship God that we don't know a single mass and then we should know also our coordination what relationship has got with us how does he communicate with us Abraham God said unto him get out of this land go to the promises so he went out to the promised land now to the promised land um he was supposed to get a promise so he didn't just relax no he wanted so he left his home while she came alive and he came to this place so he must receive the promise until one day he met God but in a form of a man God was then he knew this is the man now how did he knows Abraham he knew was he because of the inner man again in him when God created Adam I said to you took his own soul and put it in Adam was the body like myself just like you and me now but God the difference was that his soul was that of course it speaks to us as as as Paul said yeah verse 22 verse 22 he said I Delight in the law of God after the inward man otherwise the two Natures will will always fight you um but he said there's an inward man in you know Abraham Abraham knew what he wanted in his inward man um put a a gave you a soul um that's where he communicates with you whenever I want to speak to you um speak to you through yourself because the prophet says when he came down um God has got no beginning he is good no relatives now how can you imagine recognize such a person that's the man you are waiting foreign man who's supposed to come and pick you up here um how are we together amen now he must create a place in you finally Italian so that when this body as the Bible says must take his position finally attaching so whenever one of us has departed um we come to remember about that body yes because that's the body that could recognize our Lord Jesus Christ that is the body that can point him together so now when Abraham um Abraham met him the Bible says the probability he gave him the tidings are always right amen and one what did God do I remember it was a man it was just a human being and then God was in that human being and Abraham was also a human being but you could see him through the soul that was in his heart they commune about Earth communion Prophet repeats and says gave of himself now what was in Abraham what was in God because it was it was one in the same thing that is why the Bible speaks about it our Lord Jesus Christ he was a human being now we have read UTI [Music] the old lady was always at the service and then she was the only one that could not understand the languages that we speak but she had her own interpreter while she has any interpreter okay now if you could take any in the old woman yeah um and find that they are speaking English never come back she would say these people are talking a strange thing but now the old lady was every Sunday now what does that mean it means that when you hear the word of God um you don't hear it from your intelligence [Music] are we together man so when you hear it from the soul um look John first John chapter 3. the children of God does not sin um because the seed remains in him now the seed of God is the word of God when the word of God is preached um the word easy it's spelled within you remember the Bible says the Bible says when his word um comes out of his mouth when he sends it um when he preach it um that word will never miss a Target when it reaches the time it will accomplish this Affairs now it all depends on the predestination I was preaching at the uh brother Palace funeral I read the scripture in a book of uh the Bible says there are those that were ordained for condemnation then I read again the book of Acts chapter 13. that's 48 verse 48 it says there are those that are ordained for eternal life there are those that are ordained for condemnation there are those that are ordained for eternal life then what I quoted is that now there are three kinds of people in the world those that believe God those that pretends and those that don't believe God that is why in the judgment will be three types of people is in touch the Bible says today you repent and be baptized in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ and recognized the ministry of the day you are living in England there is this thing called uh when when I mean God is moving there's what we call dispensations now the dispensations is what God will be doing at what time you can worship God but it all depends on the dispensation we see peace card now when God sent Moses to Egypt Egypt to take them out of Israel there's no other option if you don't hear Moses humongous or Moses you miss a point now that that is a dispensation and when Moses Moses take them out ever keeper and cross the Red Sea bowel move and cross the desert this is finito with his job then somebody else takes over it's Joshua who let them cross there also um give them their inheritance if you remain with the the the the ministry of Moses foreign [Music] born our Lord Jesus Christ walk upon the sea walk of right amen but now magic what is he doing is he still working upon this Wednesday you need to know what is he doing now do what you are supposed to do bestie Wednesday local funny Wednesday March because he gave us promises and those promises are Divine in the book of Peter he says give us Divine promises because God is divine in this nature is divine now the Divine promises will never perish they will always be divine if you follow those divine right amen he didn't mean that his father is amen that was the ministry if you don't see the father um in Jesus which is then you missed a point again that is why he was always saying when man sees me um what do they say but he that I mean the son of man M um you see that's what you want to know yeah was that they must know who he is doesn't care whether they are going to execute him or do whatever but as long as one person who can have that Revelation Ministries I mean not just wise he said to to Peter when Peter said um what what is who is Christ is God himself what was this it was the spirit seven rainbows then they came together and formed the pillar of fire yes that is logos that is Christ that is when God processed himself there was no father there himself taking the duty of the sun Christ right when Peter said um now at the Christ the son of the Living God he said to him Flesh and Blood he's not revealed exactly what Abraham saw what is in you read your Bible it says the ministry was that going to Jerusalem because now Governor is time is revealed himself foreign [Applause] not even the angels but only there the father who Bob now if you want to know his day then you need to be a father magic finale because that is the boiling point if you're waiting for the coming of the Lord and then he says even the angels even the Santa is so the right way to know that is that you must pave your way and become the father then you will know because even the promises that I am in the farm you see if it's I in you um [Music] he'll come like a Thief in the Night episode but the Bible says only the father knows now that is a dispensation we're talking about it is the ministry is that now Joshua Joshua took them in they crossed the river children um will never give you a wrong position and what the prophet says in Prophet says the holy spirit will raise this man the Joshua paramise give you your inheritance the one misplace you and Gage Joshua never misplaced you because your position [Music] are we together I mean your position is the revealed way and and when your the word is revealed um you see your position in New Jerusalem you will know your if the word is in a human being what is the word Funda John 10. I think it's verse 35 or verse 35 it says it the one who the word of God is in him no let's let's not interpret it let's read it John chapter 10. now here I'm reading verse 35 let's start here from the state as if I and my father are one minute not speaking about two things then the Jews took up stones again to Stone him Ahmad why do they want to Stone you must answer them many good works have I showed you images from my father for which of these Works do you Stone me mentioning the Jews answered him saying for a good work s but for the blasphemy and because that thou being a man makers thyself God [Music] see now they say you are a human being don't make yourself to them that was blasphemy good boy listen to what Jesus said now Jesus answered them which is not written in your law what is if you call them Gods women and to whom the word of God came and the scripture cannot be broken when the word of God um it forms God in you when you depart from this world um foreign what if our lord Jesus comes um so what is the next step right amen the next step is a promise but there will be the battle according to Ezekiel 38. you won't be here the one that will be remaining here will be the one that says then that makes you a foolishness because the Bible says they were waiting in Matthew 25. for the coming Master figure what does the Holy Spirit do um you read I won't read it I'll quote it is there's a lot of things that I can tell you the name is now that will interpret what I uh what you can Crush when the Holy Spirit comes he will interpret what you don't understand now when they were waiting um which is [Music] some didn't have that oil when he comes um those that are having are we together amen because the Bible says he will separate people like a Shepherds separating the sheep from God there's a type that he took with him he will come back with those people white horses are we together amen so now when at the Judgment seat is he would be sitting with those people no we know Peter said yes what are we going to gain yes don't worry you'll judge angels together amen you'll sit with me in my church those that will never be charged directly to the Lake of Fire those are the angel that kept not their first estate then there comes now the people now the ordinary people and the foolish virgins then he's going to say to them Follow the Leader um holy and then he will say to the others welcome they went through the word and those will never go to the city they will come in to bring honor ugleta indoors I said to you even if it's a memorial service watching what I've been preaching to the old lady that is she called herself the bride of Christ and then when the world and when it says the word is now in the bride um some people think that when the Bible speaks about the lake foreign [Music] now some other people say please yeah tell them that we are coming later away for us there's nothing like that I died the death what do you call death threat I died my father or my grandfather um now take the word of God while there's still time who says in his card how are we together amen because after that it's torment but in any case don't repent because you are afraid you repent because you are predestinated amen look the Bible says the probability uh this man that sold Jesus Christ what is his name Judas is amen he slept with him um he saw him raising um he would have want to go to heaven but Jesus said what the one that will there was a soup right he said now this said I I've chosen you being 12. Wati and guinea Lenovo 12. but one of you is then they all said is it me is it me born is the one that will dip the Bible says the Devil Himself descended upon him all right deep nobody forced him he dipped himself so nobody forces anybody to sin again you sin because you want to sing nobody forces you not to receive the word of God in and out everywhere you will have no excuse me excuse me are we together I mean some say so there's so many churches two things you don't know what the truth is thank you amen may God bless you God bless you God bless you it's yours yes you must have the mind of Christ in you [Music] what is the mind of Christ foreign [Music] that is planted each other I said God has plucked his seat that is that God has taken is [Applause] the Bible told me God sent gifts to men um put some Apostles some prophets some teachers evangelist but I've come to know um a teacher can preach while the past is here um even though the Bible says a pasta must be apt to teach um to me give me this one is my teacher this one is our teacher amen hallelujah [Applause] that's why you say when he is he will preach because I am perfected by his ministers even when I was still with Pastor magola um we had a problem with the seventh seal all best thinking then we went to Pretoria to ask from Pastor um I I'm still having those paint out he gave unto us it's our pets when they will show him this is the printout you have given us all right thank you Peter God bless you um my pastor here Will will close the series with prayers foreign master of ceremony program director cam uh Hallelujah seven o'clock and then says nine o'clock this will be dismissed amen foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] [Music] I am yeah foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] I am [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] Jerusalem [Applause] [Music] [Music] Jerusalem [Music] God bless women
