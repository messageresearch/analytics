should have stood here in my place because they my sons except um when they when they see me standing them I say sit down we shall take over thank you pastors God bless you thank you our people have called us here me Nam um while standing on our feet read the book of Joshua as I said I'm not going to preach I'm going to offici harest read the book of Joshua for chapter 5 chter 3: 1 to 4 I think so amen Joshua 3 verse 1 to4 it reads as follows and Joshua Rose early in the morning and they removed from shittim and came to Jordan he and all the children of Israel and lodged there before they passed over and it came to pass after 3 days that the officers went through the host and they commanded the people saying when you see the Ark of the Covenant of the Lord your God and the priest of the Levites bearing it then he shall remove from your place and go after it yet there shall be a space between you and it about 2,000 cubits by measure come not near unto it that you may know Know the Way by which he must go for ye have not passed this way here let's close our eyes as we pray Heavenly Father this is the privilege I am privileged with I'm together with my brother here we are going to do this work this work was done by you in the Garden of Eden I'm standing here in your place my Lord come and take over I pray in the precious name of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen amen we may take our seats as I've said I'm not going to preach I'm going to officiate but I want to say something for a short time the topic will be taking the way for the first time taking the way for the first um that is what Joshua said to the people he said Joshua he said um firstly position them he said let the AR Take the Lead You people follow the ark because you didn't go this way before I believe um you didn't take this way before I believe you didn't take this way before if you have taken this way before you were traveling on a taxi not on your own car with your own car but now you are going to you are going to be a the main driver here in this way there must be positions to [Music] follow marriage is a journey marriage just like Christian Christianity is a joury Christianity is a joury and it's not it's not the smoth journey if they can tell you it's a smooth Journey they're telling you a lie Christianity is a war marriage also is not the smooth [Music] chain e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e e there is a divorce because div is two powers and they cannot work together there must be one power that is controlling there and that power is the word of God I believe you find the sister you have found the sister who are saving under the ministry you found you find him there saving the ministry just like Rebecca who was saving was sent by Abraham and he was saving under elazar I I believe the sister was saving under the pastor then if you find such a sister don't take a sister outside who has not she doesn't know how to say take the one weing and no circumstances you may stand up you too [Applause] always feel the temperature of the car you must always feel the temperature of your [Music] car then change the game you must be able you must be able to change the G if you see you see you can you must be able to read you read you can read the temperature there the is about to to boil change the [Applause] game things will be all right but if you keep on accelerating see that the car went to boil you look at it you see the change the G change again brother talks about the man there [Music] his wife was a Lutheran he was a message believer he went to the church he invite his wife to go there when they come back then the wife said I don't want to go with you there next time when the husband came came back from the service the husband said I I I I could I could imagine you my my my my D Hallelujah Jesus he was telling the man the man was angry C the woman how do you talk with me he said no you to your church man youring the [Music] right he should have changed the G and the Pastor said the prophet said to the the prophet said to the man when the woman says you were crying you have covered the woman and kissed her [Applause] [Music] get this and the the men that exist like that then the was the Bible says this is this uh I'm giving you this this package but it's fragile the Bible says so
