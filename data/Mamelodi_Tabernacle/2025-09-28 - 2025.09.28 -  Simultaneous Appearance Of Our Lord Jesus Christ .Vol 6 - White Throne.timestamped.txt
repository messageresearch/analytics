[1:11:36] everything is in order.
[1:11:40] H you know those that know me I don't
[1:11:43] talk too much.
[1:11:46] So yesterday
[1:11:49] I was just listening to the old men
[1:11:53] when they were sharing
[1:11:55] of the past
[1:11:57] when they start preaching the message.
[1:12:01] When pastor got the message around 7576
[1:12:08] he said
[1:12:10] married him in 1979
[1:12:14] &gt;&gt; when they were still young but yesterday
[1:12:18] they were reminding themselves of those
[1:12:20] things
[1:12:22] I was just listening
[1:12:25] but when I go home
[1:12:27] I was happy to hear such
[1:12:31] Then I said, "No wonder
[1:12:34] in the new city.
[1:12:36] There will be testimonies after
[1:12:38] testimony."
[1:12:41] So make sure
[1:12:43] you have a testimony
[1:12:46] to share. On the other side,
[1:12:50] on the other side, there's no preaching.
[1:12:54] No preaching at all. The preaching
[1:12:57] ends here on earth.
[1:13:00] But on the other side is testimonies
[1:13:03] and singing unto the Lord and praising
[1:13:07] the Lord.
[1:13:08] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[1:13:09] &gt;&gt; So make sure you have a testimony.

[1:13:21] for you must have the testimony.

[1:20:21] hell delivered up the dead which were in
[1:20:25] them. And they were judged every man
[1:20:28] according to their works. And death and
[1:20:30] hell were cast into the lake of fire.
[1:20:34] &gt;&gt; This is the second death. Amen.
[1:20:36] &gt;&gt; And whosoever was not found written in
[1:20:38] the book of life was cast into the lake
[1:20:41] of fire.
[1:20:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:42] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:20:43] &gt;&gt; You may be seated.
[1:20:51] Yesterday
[1:20:53] when we were talking,
[1:20:57] pastor Mu said something
[1:21:00] and say our pastor
[1:21:02] has preached
[1:21:04] the entire message.
[1:21:07] When we preach,
[1:21:10] we are preaching the message he has
[1:21:12] preached already.
[1:21:14] We are just preaching to go to the
[1:21:17] rapture
[1:21:19] from long time ago until today.
[1:21:24] So we had a good time. I had a good time
[1:21:28] with the discosana
[1:21:30] &gt;&gt; and then we said let's shame the devil.
[1:21:35] [Music]
[1:21:37] Then he started to give me the testimony
[1:21:40] when he was with the pastor and they
[1:21:43] involved an accident.
[1:21:45] The car called ro three times
[1:21:49] and he thought the pastor is dead
[1:21:52] something in the early 80s.
[1:21:56] They were just know like sleeping in the
[1:21:59] car.
[1:22:01] Both of them they wake up. The car was
[1:22:05] beyond control.
[1:22:08] The men of God came out of the car.
[1:22:12] No either.
[1:22:18] &gt;&gt; I want to tell you this morning, the
[1:22:20] devil hates this church.
[1:22:24] [Music]
[1:22:26] &gt;&gt; He want to see this church
[1:22:29] scattered.
[1:22:31] And I'm saying the children of God this
[1:22:33] morning,
[1:22:35] don't be a vessel
[1:22:38] of the devil
[1:22:41] [Music]
[1:22:43] to scatter the church.
[1:22:47] But if you try,
[1:22:49] you're not going to win
[1:22:51] [Applause]
[1:22:53] because this church is the church of the
[1:22:56] living God.
[1:22:58] If you defeat it, you must have defeated
[1:23:02] it.
[1:23:05] But if the devil failed,
[1:23:08] you will failed.
[1:23:10] This church will remain intact.
[1:23:14] [Music]
[1:23:16] This church
[1:23:18] is the judgment seat.
[1:23:24] When the pastor goes to Africa,
[1:23:27] to preach this message was bringing
[1:23:31] judgment to Africa.
[1:23:34] [Applause]
[1:23:36] You see this pullpit I'm staying behind.
[1:23:41] Don't take it for granted.
[1:23:43] Can I tell you this morning, you are
[1:23:46] right in the judgment seat.
[1:23:49] You disobey.
[1:23:52] you disobey the message behind this pool
[1:23:57] this morning. There's a white throne
[1:24:00] judgment waiting for you.
[1:24:03] Brother says, "Judgment began in the
[1:24:08] house of God.
[1:24:11] Those that do not want to hear
[1:24:14] from the pullpit,
[1:24:17] there's a white throne judgment
[1:24:20] waiting for you.
[1:24:23] Don't be the vessel of the devil.
[1:24:27] Don't be like Judas.
[1:24:29] He became the vessel of the devil.
[1:24:32] Still Jesus said it was better if Jesus
[1:24:37] was not born.
[1:24:42] I think I'm talking to the right people.
[1:24:46] Don't be that. Just be a child of God
[1:24:51] who is in a relaxation mode
[1:24:54] knowing that the old ship of Sion
[1:24:59] is cruising
[1:25:01] other ships
[1:25:03] the whales big fishes I mean the whale
[1:25:07] the fishes or whatever will try
[1:25:11] to sink it
[1:25:14] but it will never sink
[1:25:17] stay inside.
[1:25:19] God is in control.
[1:25:27] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:25:28] &gt;&gt; This morning, I'm going to continue
[1:25:32] where we stopped with our series of the
[1:25:36] simultaneous appearance of our Lord
[1:25:38] Jesus Christ.
[1:25:41] But I'm looking at the white throne
[1:25:44] judgment
[1:25:46] because now we are on time
[1:25:50] in the tribulation
[1:25:53] in the three and a half years of wedding
[1:25:56] supper
[1:25:59] in the war of Armageddon
[1:26:02] in the millennium
[1:26:04] in the white throne judgment
[1:26:07] is still time. But after the white
[1:26:09] throne of judgment,
[1:26:13] there's no more time. We are heading to
[1:26:16] eternity.
[1:26:18] We are in a journey. When you are in a
[1:26:21] journey, the other people will
[1:26:24] discourage you, but be like an eagle.
[1:26:29] Flip your winds.
[1:26:31] Go to the level where you will hear no
[1:26:34] noise that can hinder you to continue
[1:26:38] with your dream.
[1:26:40] Be like an eagle.
[1:26:45] Don't be a daspin for gossip.
[1:26:48] [Applause]
[1:26:52] You will be injuring yourself.
[1:26:56] You will be hindering yourself.
[1:27:00] See the blessings of God.
[1:27:03] There's a blessings of God waiting for
[1:27:06] you. There's life eternal waiting for
[1:27:10] you. Listen to no noise.
[1:27:16] [Music]
[1:27:19] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:27:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:27:22] &gt;&gt; Uh let me read from the question and
[1:27:26] answer.
[1:27:29] I read
[1:27:32] brother Brennham says brother
[1:27:35] &gt;&gt; then look
[1:27:37] you say
[1:27:38] &gt;&gt; well now
[1:27:40] &gt;&gt; brother Brenham
[1:27:42] &gt;&gt; do you mean to tell me there's going to
[1:27:44] be people
[1:27:46] that there will be at the white throne
[1:27:48] judgment is the question
[1:27:52] brother Brham says the bride will never
[1:27:57] be judged
[1:27:59] Are you the bride this morning? You will
[1:28:02] never be judged,
[1:28:04] but you will be the judge.
[1:28:07] She's in Christ.
[1:28:10] How do you get in Christ?
[1:28:13] By one spirit. We are all baptized
[1:28:17] into one body. Is that right? It's
[1:28:20] talking about you. If you are not going
[1:28:24] to be judged,
[1:28:26] but you are going to be the judge,
[1:28:30] why you worry about the things of the
[1:28:31] world?
[1:28:35] The only person who was worrying about
[1:28:38] the things of the world was Judas
[1:28:42] because he wanted money.
[1:28:46] He He worried about money.
[1:28:49] He worried about money. Do you
[1:28:52] understand? And the money that he had
[1:28:56] couldn't assist him with anything, he
[1:28:59] end up paying himself.
[1:29:02] Amen.
[1:29:05] &gt;&gt; The Bible said judgment was said
[1:29:10] and the books were open. Is that right?
[1:29:14] &gt;&gt; Books of sinners.
[1:29:18] Not the book of the bride, but the books
[1:29:21] of sinners.
[1:29:23] In the white throne judgment,
[1:29:26] only sinners
[1:29:28] will be judged, but the bride will never
[1:29:32] be judged.
[1:29:37] Another book was open which is the book
[1:29:39] of life. And every man
[1:29:43] just thus.
[1:29:46] Is that right? And who was doing the
[1:29:49] judging?
[1:29:50] &gt;&gt; Jesus.
[1:29:52] &gt;&gt; And his saints,
[1:29:56] &gt;&gt; the king
[1:29:58] and the queen,
[1:30:00] &gt;&gt; the groom and the bride will do. They
[1:30:05] judge
[1:30:07] because they've been judged
[1:30:11] from this pullpit.
[1:30:14] If the word of God this morning condemns
[1:30:17] you, repent
[1:30:21] because the word of God is the church
[1:30:26] this morning. If you come to service
[1:30:29] with long face
[1:30:32] with long face
[1:30:34] and go home with long face, you were not
[1:30:38] supposed to be here.
[1:30:40] This message must change you, must make
[1:30:44] you something. You come sad.
[1:30:48] You come sad, you go home happy.
[1:30:53] That is why we are in the series. You
[1:30:56] come the same, go back the same
[1:31:00] problem with you. Not the church, not
[1:31:05] the pastor, not the preacher, not the
[1:31:07] person next to you, but yourself.
[1:31:11] Pastor Mo was preaching,
[1:31:14] the person you must defeat,
[1:31:16] it's yourself.
[1:31:18] [Applause]
[1:31:22] One is saying, "If things do not go this
[1:31:25] way in the church,
[1:31:27] I'm leaving. There's four doors to exit.
[1:31:35] I know of this man who worked for a
[1:31:38] certain company.
[1:31:41] He said, "Yeah, there's a pack date
[1:31:44] here. I'm not going to work for this
[1:31:46] company anymore. I'm leaving." They
[1:31:49] said, "Leave." And he left. And later
[1:31:53] after 3 months, they call him. They say,
[1:31:57] "Hey, it was good for you to leave.
[1:32:00] Since you left our prophet is high now.
[1:32:05] Do you want to think
[1:32:08] when you leave this church will stuck
[1:32:13] 20 souls
[1:32:15] will come in.
[1:32:17] [Music]
[1:32:19] You cannot hold God hostage.
[1:32:24] &gt;&gt; Never.
[1:32:25] &gt;&gt; We are begging no one. Amen.
[1:32:33] &gt;&gt; He said,
[1:32:35] &gt;&gt; he came and minister unto the ancients
[1:32:38] of days
[1:32:41] whose hair is like a wool
[1:32:45] and 10,000 times 10,000 comes to him
[1:32:51] and minister to him
[1:32:54] in the judment.
[1:32:57] Here Jesus
[1:32:59] returns as king and queen.
[1:33:03] You are the queen. He return with you.
[1:33:07] Aren't you happy for that?
[1:33:11] The wedding is over
[1:33:13] and he's married.
[1:33:16] He's a king. You are the queen. You
[1:33:20] standing there with him. And there stand
[1:33:24] a sanctified bunch.
[1:33:28] And God said, "Stand to my right side."
[1:33:34] That's the book was open
[1:33:37] was sinners.
[1:33:40] Is the book of the sinners. Get over on
[1:33:43] my left.
[1:33:47] Here is ones that had their name written
[1:33:49] in the lamb's book of life.
[1:33:54] Amen. I remember the pastor the other
[1:33:57] day said.
[1:33:59] If someone is a thief in the church
[1:34:02] and you start preaching and just pass
[1:34:07] on the people that steal,
[1:34:10] those thieves
[1:34:12] will be the first to complain.
[1:34:21] Are you serious?
[1:34:22] &gt;&gt; Because we can't hear about the fat
[1:34:26] thieves.
[1:34:26] &gt;&gt; We just hear about the thieves.
[1:34:28] &gt;&gt; Stop stealing.
[1:34:31] [Applause]
[1:34:36] Do you understand?
[1:34:38] &gt;&gt; I know. I preach about the women of
[1:34:40] valor.
[1:34:44] Some men are angry about me.
[1:34:53] &gt;&gt; Let me tell you, I have part two of that
[1:34:55] message.
[1:34:56] &gt;&gt; All right.
[1:34:58] I'm going to preach it again until you
[1:35:02] get your family right.
[1:35:05] Why?
[1:35:07] Because I'm talking about Christ and the
[1:35:12] bride.
[1:35:14] [Applause]
[1:35:16] &gt;&gt; So just brace yourself
[1:35:20] is coming.
[1:35:26] Amen.
[1:35:28] Have you ever seen someone who doesn't
[1:35:31] have a problem when the message is being
[1:35:34] preached? is amen. Amen. After amen.
[1:35:38] Amen. Amen. After amen. The one who has
[1:35:41] a problem is the one that complains.
[1:35:47] &gt;&gt; Don't complain. Just repent and do the
[1:35:50] right thing. Then you will say amen
[1:35:54] after amen. Amen.
[1:35:59] &gt;&gt; Judas is scariot.
[1:36:00] &gt;&gt; Judas is
[1:36:02] &gt;&gt; I'm referring to Judas is
[1:36:06] The one that was moving with Jesus
[1:36:09] today his spirit is antichrist.
[1:36:14] [Music]
[1:36:17] &gt;&gt; Jesus was the son of God.
[1:36:20] Came from God returned to God. Jesus was
[1:36:24] the son of Pisa.
[1:36:27] Came from hell and he will return to
[1:36:30] hell.
[1:36:34] Jesus was taken
[1:36:37] the repentant sinner with him.
[1:36:41] Judas taken
[1:36:44] and repented with him.
[1:36:47] It's always the case.
[1:36:49] Abel
[1:36:51] &gt;&gt; and Cain,
[1:36:53] &gt;&gt; Jacob and Esau,
[1:36:56] &gt;&gt; Jesus and Judas. Today the spirit of
[1:37:01] antichrist
[1:37:03] is the one like unto Judas.
[1:37:12] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:37:13] &gt;&gt; It it is always like that. Now watch
[1:37:17] Judas is Judas
[1:37:19] &gt;&gt; was justified by faith
[1:37:23] and believed on the Lord Jesus
[1:37:26] and was baptized.
[1:37:29] And the Bible say Jesus baptized the
[1:37:33] disciples
[1:37:35] disciple
[1:37:37] and it was like that. Jesus himself
[1:37:41] give them power against the unclean
[1:37:45] spirit
[1:37:47] and they went out and they cast out
[1:37:50] devils.
[1:37:52] Is that right? And they healed the sick.
[1:37:56] Is that right? And they come back
[1:37:59] sanctified,
[1:38:01] rejoicing,
[1:38:03] jumping,
[1:38:04] shouting and praising God. Is that
[1:38:08] right? And sad.
[1:38:10] &gt;&gt; Even the devils.
[1:38:12] Even the devils
[1:38:16] &gt;&gt; is subject to us.
[1:38:19] They were happy. And Jesus said to them,
[1:38:23] don't rejoice because the devil is
[1:38:27] subject to you.
[1:38:30] Rejoice when you are named
[1:38:34] in the book of heaven.
[1:38:37] That's all you need.
[1:38:41] I am not referring to any individual.
[1:38:45] I am referring to the antichrist spirit.
[1:38:50] As brother say, Judas today is the
[1:38:55] antichrist spirit.
[1:39:02] &gt;&gt; Are we still together this morning?
[1:39:07] And Judas
[1:39:08] &gt;&gt; Judas
[1:39:08] &gt;&gt; was with them.
[1:39:12] &gt;&gt; One of them
[1:39:15] &gt;&gt; called out
[1:39:17] &gt;&gt; called out.
[1:39:18] &gt;&gt; Yes. sanctified
[1:39:21] and his name written in the lamb's book
[1:39:24] of life.
[1:39:26] Matthew chapter 10
[1:39:29] chapter 10.
[1:39:29] &gt;&gt; His name is written in the book of life.
[1:39:34] Our names are written in the lamb's book
[1:39:38] of life.
[1:39:41] Amen. He called each one of them and
[1:39:45] Judas
[1:39:47] and every one of them right down there
[1:39:50] he sent them out give them power against
[1:39:55] unclean spirits.
[1:39:59] Everything
[1:40:00] that happened will happen today because
[1:40:05] history
[1:40:07] &gt;&gt; repeat itself.
[1:40:12] One thing I ask God
[1:40:16] that if I'm standing behind the pullpit,
[1:40:20] I mustn't preach a social gospel
[1:40:26] because
[1:40:27] &gt;&gt; it will take us nowhere.
[1:40:34] Amen.
[1:40:34] &gt;&gt; The social gospel
[1:40:39] &gt;&gt; is the one that does not touch your
[1:40:42] life.
[1:40:44] The one that is itching your ears.
[1:40:51] Them had done went home.
[1:40:54] them had done went home and received
[1:40:58] their glorified bodies
[1:41:01] and lived through the millennium
[1:41:05] here
[1:41:06] in the white throne judgment judging
[1:41:09] those. He said he will separate
[1:41:13] sheep from the goats.
[1:41:17] When pastor Mo was preaching last week,
[1:41:21] he said shepherd will just had all
[1:41:29] the sheep,
[1:41:31] &gt;&gt; the goat, the cows, the donkeys. When
[1:41:36] they are together, you will see their
[1:41:38] character.
[1:41:40] You will see the goat
[1:41:44] jumping the wall.
[1:41:47] You will see the cows using their horns.
[1:41:52] You will see the donkey kicking the
[1:41:55] shepherd.
[1:41:57] You will see the sheep humble as they
[1:42:00] are.
[1:42:07] It's it's natural.
[1:42:09] That is why when you see the goat
[1:42:13] acting,
[1:42:17] preach hard and harder,
[1:42:21] that goat will never be ashamed.
[1:42:26] Be careful wherever you are.
[1:42:30] When you gossip
[1:42:32] about the man of God, you're like a
[1:42:34] donkey. You are kicking him, but he's
[1:42:38] still your shepherd. He's still looking
[1:42:41] after yourself.
[1:42:43] Be careful.
[1:42:46] [Music]
[1:42:56] It looks like chaotic
[1:42:58] &gt;&gt; when you know
[1:43:02] &gt;&gt; knowing that is not chaotic
[1:43:04] &gt;&gt; the person himself is in chaos
[1:43:10] I once preached
[1:43:13] sometimes back
[1:43:15] about the tube brother is talking about
[1:43:22] you know he was talking about the the
[1:43:26] cattle cuts,
[1:43:30] the cars,
[1:43:32] the aeroplane
[1:43:34] and going to the space as the astronaut.
[1:43:39] &gt;&gt; He said the astronauts
[1:43:42] they in a tube they are not complaining
[1:43:46] because that tube is safe.
[1:43:50] Everyone inside is safe. No one is
[1:43:54] complaining. What is going up
[1:43:58] beyond the sky where there's no noise. A
[1:44:02] child of God. If you are inside, you
[1:44:05] just go higher and higher. Just be like
[1:44:09] an eagle.
[1:44:11] Everything that happen surround you, God
[1:44:16] knows about them.
[1:44:20] You did not know
[1:44:23] that today you will be in the service
[1:44:26] but God knew. That is why we normally
[1:44:31] say if the Lord will
[1:44:34] I will be in the church.
[1:44:39] But other people
[1:44:41] live like they own the world.
[1:44:49] Be careful of what you do,
[1:44:52] &gt;&gt; of what you say,
[1:44:54] &gt;&gt; of what you react to
[1:44:58] that you are not like that donkey.
[1:45:06] I'm going to read you a story here.
[1:45:10] Just listen. It's about the white throne
[1:45:13] judgment.
[1:45:16] Amen.
[1:45:19] Let me check the message. Uh
[1:45:23] or from the church and its condition.
[1:45:27] &gt;&gt; The church and its condition.
[1:45:30] &gt;&gt; Are you still with me?
[1:45:34] here. Sometimes ago
[1:45:38] or about 100 years ago,
[1:45:44] there was a great Christian
[1:45:48] lived in southwest
[1:45:52] United States.
[1:45:53] &gt;&gt; Great Christian.
[1:45:58] &gt;&gt; His name was Daniel Kerry.
[1:46:01] &gt;&gt; Daniel Kerry.
[1:46:01] &gt;&gt; A wonderful man.
[1:46:06] a godly man, a sainted man, a real
[1:46:10] Christian,
[1:46:12] a man that everybody thought so much of.
[1:46:19] Such a wonderful person.
[1:46:22] Did you hear what I said?
[1:46:24] A wonderful man,
[1:46:28] a godly man,
[1:46:30] a sainted man,
[1:46:33] a real Christian,
[1:46:36] a man that everybody want to be like
[1:46:38] him.
[1:46:40] Daniel
[1:46:46] and the story goes that
[1:46:49] he died or went into a trend.
[1:46:55] And he said as he went up to heaven
[1:47:00] when he died and when he got to the
[1:47:03] plegate
[1:47:07] the caretaker come to the door and say
[1:47:11] who are you?
[1:47:14] Amen. Imagine a message believer
[1:47:18] who you are sure of everything
[1:47:22] about your life. It happens that you die
[1:47:26] and the heaven says
[1:47:29] I don't know you.
[1:47:35] He said with confidence,
[1:47:38] &gt;&gt; I'm an evangelist.
[1:47:41] &gt;&gt; Daniel Curry.
[1:47:42] &gt;&gt; Daniel Kerry. I've won thousands of
[1:47:44] souls to Christ.
[1:47:48] I want to come in this morning.
[1:47:51] My life's journeys ended on earth.
[1:47:54] I have no place to go now.
[1:47:57] That's the way it's coming to you
[1:48:01] some morning
[1:48:03] as a sinner.
[1:48:05] That's the way it's coming to you as a
[1:48:10] backslider.
[1:48:13] That's the way it's coming to you.
[1:48:17] Grieve the Holy Ghost.
[1:48:20] Holy Spirit away from them.
[1:48:24] Not be gentle
[1:48:27] and tender anymore.
[1:48:31] You haven't cried for years. Amen.
[1:48:34] &gt;&gt; You haven't cried for years.
[1:48:38] &gt;&gt; You haven't blushed for I don't know
[1:48:40] when.
[1:48:44] And all that modestly gone from you.
[1:48:49] Sure,
[1:48:50] &gt;&gt; it's going to come to your door one of
[1:48:54] this morning. And as the gentle Holy
[1:48:57] Spirit comes and knocks,
[1:49:01] why don't you just let him eat?
[1:49:05] So when Daniel Curry come there
[1:49:09] to the gate, they went in
[1:49:12] and said, "We'll see if you got your
[1:49:15] name here."
[1:49:18] They looked around. They couldn't find
[1:49:21] any name.
[1:49:23] Said there's no Daniel Curry here.
[1:49:29] A man who brought thousands and thousand
[1:49:33] and thousand to the Lord.
[1:49:37] believing God, but when he get to heaven
[1:49:41] right at the gate, they don't know him.
[1:49:47] &gt;&gt; Maybe you have your own company,
[1:49:51] go to work in the morning and then the
[1:49:54] security officer said,
[1:49:56] "Sir, I don't see your name.
[1:50:01] You will start to explain or I will fire
[1:50:04] you because this is my company and dead
[1:50:07] and dead but
[1:50:10] no name.
[1:50:12] That was Daniel K.
[1:50:15] Oh, he said surely.
[1:50:18] He said I'm an evangelist.
[1:50:21] He said I have one soul to Christ.
[1:50:24] I've tried to do the things that's
[1:50:27] right.
[1:50:29] Oh, he said he said that the caretaker
[1:50:33] said, "Sir, I'm sorry to tell you, but
[1:50:38] there's no Daniel car."
[1:50:40] Sir, I'll tell you what you might do.
[1:50:46] We have no right here to take your case.
[1:50:52] He said, "But do you want to appeal your
[1:50:54] case?
[1:50:57] You can appeal it. to the white throne
[1:51:00] judgment.
[1:51:02] If you want to but said, "We have no
[1:51:05] mercy here for you at all because we
[1:51:11] don't have you here.
[1:51:15] There's no mercy for you. Do you want to
[1:51:18] appeal your case?"
[1:51:21] Daniel Kerry said, "Sir, what more can I
[1:51:25] do but to appeal my case?
[1:51:29] He said, "Well, then you can go to the
[1:51:32] white throne judgment
[1:51:34] and appeal your case."
[1:51:39] Daniel Curry said,
[1:51:41] &gt;&gt; Daniel K
[1:51:43] &gt;&gt; that if he felt itself going through the
[1:51:46] space for about an hour.
[1:51:48] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[1:51:50] If he he felt his himself
[1:51:54] going through the space
[1:51:56] for about an hour said he come into this
[1:52:00] place.
[1:52:01] It got lighter
[1:52:05] and lighter and lighter. Amen. Said
[1:52:09] further
[1:52:10] further
[1:52:12] he went the lighter it got.
[1:52:19] It was a hund times.
[1:52:24] Thousand of times brighter than the sun
[1:52:26] ever shines
[1:52:29] &gt;&gt; and said he was trembling
[1:52:33] and trembling.
[1:52:35] He said said when he got in the middle
[1:52:38] of that life,
[1:52:41] he had a voice.
[1:52:44] Was you perfect on earth?
[1:52:49] Just come out of a lie.
[1:52:54] You
[1:52:55] &gt;&gt; you can deceive us.
[1:52:59] But when that light come brother,
[1:53:02] when that light comes, sister
[1:53:05] everything is clear.
[1:53:12] He said,
[1:53:14] "No, I wasn't perfect."
[1:53:16] He was trembling,
[1:53:18] but at the initial stage,
[1:53:22] he had confidence.
[1:53:25] He got confidence that I'm in charge
[1:53:28] here. I will work for this place. I
[1:53:32] belong here. When the light come, he was
[1:53:36] trembling
[1:53:37] because he realized that he was a
[1:53:41] sinner.
[1:53:45] We have the same people today.
[1:53:52] &gt;&gt; Said,
[1:53:53] &gt;&gt; did you always play honest with
[1:53:55] everybody
[1:53:59] when they were asking Daniel Kh?
[1:54:03] &gt;&gt; I'm asking you,
[1:54:07] did you always play honest with
[1:54:09] everybody?
[1:54:13] I won't say those yes that says yes must
[1:54:18] raise their hand I won't do that don't
[1:54:21] be scared he said no a few things come
[1:54:25] to my mind
[1:54:28] but I wasn't just exactly honest about
[1:54:33] said no I guess
[1:54:36] I was not
[1:54:40] there are people that play
[1:54:45] perfection,
[1:54:48] but they're not perfect.
[1:54:55] &gt;&gt; Did you tell the truth?
[1:54:59] In every case in your life,
[1:55:03] he was trembling.
[1:55:07] I remember some things
[1:55:10] as you are remembering your things.
[1:55:13] I've told that I wasn't shady
[1:55:18] shady. I was never
[1:55:22] fruitful just exactly.
[1:55:25] He said then did you take anything
[1:55:29] that did not belong to you?
[1:55:32] &gt;&gt; Anything
[1:55:34] money? anything else that did not belong
[1:55:38] to you
[1:55:43] before the light.
[1:55:46] &gt;&gt; You can hide but before the light
[1:55:56] said he thought on earth
[1:56:00] that he was pretty good
[1:56:03] but he was condemned.
[1:56:06] He said, "No, no, no, no, no, no. I just
[1:56:10] took small money. I just had sweet
[1:56:14] lies."
[1:56:17] You know, a human being is a human
[1:56:20] being.
[1:56:28] &gt;&gt; Then he said, "No, I've took things that
[1:56:30] did not belong to."
[1:56:33] But whom do I talk about here?
[1:56:37] An evangelist,
[1:56:39] an honest man, a loyal man,
[1:56:43] &gt;&gt; a wonderful man, a man who everybody
[1:56:46] love to be like him.
[1:56:49] Now he's before the life. Are you aware
[1:56:53] that this morning you are in front of
[1:56:56] the light?
[1:56:57] [Applause]
[1:57:05] He said,
[1:57:07] &gt;&gt; "Then you wasn't perfect.
[1:57:10] &gt;&gt; We want perfect people here.
[1:57:13] You might have preached to many,
[1:57:15] but you are not perfect. You don't
[1:57:17] belong here."
[1:57:21] He said, "No, I wasn't perfect.
[1:57:26] Don't worry. I won't say those that are
[1:57:30] perfect should raise their hand.
[1:57:36] Don't worry.
[1:57:40] He said he was looking
[1:57:44] any minute for a person.
[1:57:47] He thought he's finished.
[1:57:51] Maybe when he was passing,
[1:57:53] the people he preached
[1:57:56] were there looking at him, him looking
[1:58:00] at them, wavering
[1:58:03] saying, "Our master is coming." But our
[1:58:07] master was denied opportunity
[1:58:13] because he played holier and that was
[1:58:16] what
[1:58:22] He was looking any minute for a blast to
[1:58:25] come
[1:58:28] from that great light
[1:58:31] from where the T rested
[1:58:35] condemned.
[1:58:38] Said just then
[1:58:40] he had a voice behind him
[1:58:44] that was sweeter than any other mother's
[1:58:47] voice.
[1:58:51] said, "He turned to look,
[1:58:55] and the sweetest face
[1:58:59] he ever saw,
[1:59:01] sweeter than any mother's face
[1:59:05] was standing before him
[1:59:08] and said, he said, "Father,
[1:59:13] &gt;&gt; Daniel Kh
[1:59:15] &gt;&gt; stood for me down on
[1:59:19] It's true. He wasn't perfect,
[1:59:23] but he stood for me.
[1:59:27] He stood for me on earth. Now I'm going
[1:59:30] to stand for him in heaven.
[1:59:34] take all his sins
[1:59:36] and put them over my account.
[1:59:46] &gt;&gt; Brother,
[1:59:48] if you can know this,
[1:59:50] &gt;&gt; how God did things,
[1:59:54] how God did things,
[1:59:56] &gt;&gt; you will stop being pompous.
[2:00:04] Who's going to stand for you
[2:00:07] &gt;&gt; that day, my brother?
[2:00:10] &gt;&gt; If you give him away
[2:00:13] from today,
[2:00:15] I just can't preach anymore.
[2:00:21] Do we still believe the word of God?
[2:00:24] Then the word of God says
[2:00:26] is by grace.
[2:00:34] It's not about what you have.
[2:00:37] &gt;&gt; It's not about the groups you have
[2:00:41] talking whatever you're talking against
[2:00:44] the man of God.
[2:00:46] Stop that thing.
[2:00:48] It's by grace to go to heaven. There's
[2:00:53] nothing good that you can do before God.
[2:00:57] You can please God. We must be God
[2:00:59] himself.
[2:01:01] Come in you.
[2:01:03] Brenam says we are the mechanic. He is
[2:01:07] the dynamic. We must direct our life. If
[2:01:10] you think you know the people that know
[2:01:15] went in hell.
[2:01:19] Let's appreciate
[2:01:21] the grace of God. Let's be merciful
[2:01:25] to one another. Because once that life
[2:01:30] hit you, nothing you can hide before
[2:01:33] him.
[2:01:35] I'm telling you this morning, this
[2:01:38] pullpit
[2:01:39] &gt;&gt; is the light.
[2:01:41] Go and set yourself.
[2:01:46] [Music]
[2:01:47] In fact, for you to be worthy,
[2:01:50] to be in heaven, it's not even your
[2:01:53] effort.
[2:01:59] They that wait upon the Lord.
[2:02:04] Oh my.
[2:02:07] I remember the story of Solomon.
[2:02:11] God tell
[2:02:15] only what you need
[2:02:18] given unto you.
[2:02:20] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:02:21] &gt;&gt; Solomon ask one thing.
[2:02:24] &gt;&gt; Lord God, if you can give me wisdom
[2:02:30] to lead
[2:02:32] your nations, that's all I need.
[2:02:37] Those
[2:02:40] that had opportunity
[2:02:43] reading the books
[2:02:45] &gt;&gt; or having knowledge of some kind,
[2:02:48] I want to tell you this. The best person
[2:02:51] on earth
[2:02:53] is the one who can manage conflict.
[2:02:59] That's what Solomon asked.
[2:03:03] Conflict management.
[2:03:07] With David,
[2:03:09] &gt;&gt; it was not there.
[2:03:11] &gt;&gt; David, he threw his sword
[2:03:15] and kill. But with Solomon, he managed
[2:03:19] to comfort.
[2:03:21] When a woman come to him, he said, "This
[2:03:25] one took my child because he has his
[2:03:28] day."
[2:03:29] Solomon does not take one-sided story.
[2:03:33] Brothers and sisters, you take one-sided
[2:03:37] story
[2:03:38] and dispute bitterness
[2:03:41] amongst the children of God.
[2:03:45] Be careful.
[2:03:46] One story, you go around, you have mess
[2:03:50] up with God.
[2:03:52] But a conflict management person
[2:03:56] this one story hear this one story get
[2:04:00] the people together and make a decision
[2:04:07] but you
[2:04:14] then is a group of
[2:04:17] you
[2:04:21] conflict management
[2:04:23] is not important in life. We fight in
[2:04:26] the truth because we had stories with
[2:04:31] them. Stop that thing.
[2:04:35] [Applause]
[2:04:40] Amen.
[2:04:42] &gt;&gt; What is happening
[2:04:44] and I have to say it
[2:04:46] &gt;&gt; without any fear.
[2:04:51] This church is untouchable.
[2:04:55] The devil tried
[2:04:57] &gt;&gt; and tried and tried again. He's still
[2:04:59] intact.
[2:05:04] I love Solomon. He was a man of peace.
[2:05:08] When you are fighting, he called you.
[2:05:13] What are you saying?
[2:05:18] What are you saying?
[2:05:19] stand
[2:05:23] you also come let's talk for the child
[2:05:26] belongs to this one that was Solomon
[2:05:33] conflict management is very important in
[2:05:35] life
[2:05:38] if you failed it you failed in life
[2:05:42] if you failed in conflict management you
[2:05:46] have failed in life,
[2:05:52] you become the vessel of the devil
[2:05:56] and he will use you adequately.
[2:06:02] &gt;&gt; I don't have a space for that.
[2:06:04] &gt;&gt; Don't come to me and gossip about
[2:06:06] someone.
[2:06:08] don't have a space
[2:06:14] &gt;&gt; for what we do behind the closed door
[2:06:19] they will be shown
[2:06:22] at the throne white throne cross
[2:06:26] when that light strike
[2:06:29] oh I'm happy this morning to tell you
[2:06:32] that you will never be judged in the
[2:06:37] white throne judgement
[2:06:38] Only if you accept this judgment,
[2:06:44] [Applause]
[2:06:45] [Music]
[2:06:47] &gt;&gt; you disobey this one,
[2:06:49] &gt;&gt; that one is waiting for you.
[2:06:56] Remember the story of Daniel K.
[2:07:00] &gt;&gt; A man amongst
[2:07:03] men.
[2:07:07] Imagine one day you get to heaven. You
[2:07:10] don't find brother
[2:07:12] the one who was the prophet in our time.
[2:07:21] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:07:22] &gt;&gt; The sea shall not hide with a shack.
[2:07:28] That's why the rapture is of the royal
[2:07:33] seed
[2:07:35] has to come first.
[2:07:38] The royal seed. The one that will be
[2:07:41] judging
[2:07:43] sinners has to come first.
[2:07:47] Once you are in the rapture, you are
[2:07:49] quite sure you will be in the millennia.
[2:07:53] You are quite sure you will be the
[2:07:55] judge.
[2:07:56] At the white throne judgment you are
[2:07:59] quite sure you will be in the new city
[2:08:07] and the rest of the dead
[2:08:10] live not for a thousand years.
[2:08:13] Then they were brought up
[2:08:16] at the white throne judgment.
[2:08:19] See there's no judgment
[2:08:23] &gt;&gt; to the royal sea. Hallelujah.
[2:08:27] There's no judgment
[2:08:29] &gt;&gt; to you because you listen
[2:08:34] from the pulpit.
[2:08:36] &gt;&gt; When your pastor preaches, you say,
[2:08:39] "Amen."
[2:08:40] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[2:08:42] You are the royals
[2:08:45] or the predestinated seed of Abraham.
[2:08:49] Brothers and sisters,
[2:08:52] stop talking about things you cannot
[2:08:55] control. Just be a son and a daughter of
[2:08:59] the living God and say, "Mine eyes
[2:09:03] have seen the glory of the coming of the
[2:09:07] Lord." That's what you saw. That's where
[2:09:10] you heading on. The rest
[2:09:22] John first noticed
[2:09:24] &gt;&gt; and mentioned the whiteness of his hair.
[2:09:29] The man young man who was killed at the
[2:09:34] age of 33.
[2:09:37] John notice noticed him with the
[2:09:41] whiteness of his hair. It was white and
[2:09:45] as bright
[2:09:47] as
[2:09:50] this was not because of his age.
[2:09:53] Jesus Christ.
[2:09:54] &gt;&gt; Jesus died at the age of 33.
[2:09:59] But when you look at him at the judgment
[2:10:02] day,
[2:10:04] he's not the man of the age of 33.
[2:10:07] His hair is white and bright.
[2:10:17] The brilliantly,
[2:10:19] &gt;&gt; the brilliantly
[2:10:22] white hair does not signify age but
[2:10:26] experience.
[2:10:31] Maturity
[2:10:33] and wisdom.
[2:10:42] The eternal one
[2:10:44] does not age.
[2:10:47] What is it? Time
[2:10:50] to God.
[2:10:52] What is time to God?
[2:10:55] Time means little to God. But wisdom
[2:10:59] means much.
[2:11:03] It is it is as when Solomon called to
[2:11:06] God for wisdom
[2:11:09] to judge the people of Israel. Now he is
[2:11:14] coming
[2:11:15] the judge of all earth.
[2:11:19] He will be crowned with wisdom.
[2:11:24] That is what the white and the hair
[2:11:26] signify.
[2:11:30] Those that were in court and so forth.
[2:11:34] They see the judges
[2:11:37] having weak
[2:11:40] white week. That thing signify
[2:11:45] wisdom and experience and a maturity.
[2:11:50] Same thing when Jesus come as a judge,
[2:11:55] we will be with him. That means at the
[2:11:59] end the woman of valor,
[2:12:03] it's you.
[2:12:09] Don't personalize it like I'm referring
[2:12:12] to someone. I'm referring to you, the
[2:12:17] church of God or the bride is the woman
[2:12:20] of valor.
[2:12:23] Hallelujah.
[2:12:26] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:12:27] &gt;&gt; We will be with him
[2:12:30] &gt;&gt; when he judge.
[2:12:33] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen.
[2:12:34] &gt;&gt; Now,
[2:12:37] when you disbelieve the word of God like
[2:12:40] it's been preached from the pulpit,
[2:12:43] everything will be clear
[2:12:46] and you will see yourself
[2:12:50] denying the word of God
[2:12:55] until you will say
[2:12:59] you judge perfectly.
[2:13:02] &gt;&gt; No one will blame God. You know the
[2:13:06] confident Daniel Kar
[2:13:10] was sure what he did here on earth
[2:13:15] sins. But on the other side, he was
[2:13:18] lying. He was hating. He He took money
[2:13:23] from innocent people.
[2:13:26] Then he thinks that God doesn't see
[2:13:28] them.
[2:13:31] Wait for that light.
[2:13:33] that is more brighter than the sun.
[2:13:36] When you see that light, you become
[2:13:39] lighter
[2:13:41] and lighter and you no longer
[2:13:43] controlling yourself.
[2:13:46] You start to face the reality.
[2:13:50] Amen.
[2:13:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. That is why
[2:13:59] it is by grace to be in the message.
[2:14:03] It's by grace to see the revelation of
[2:14:07] the seven se
[2:14:09] by grace to see us in him.
[2:14:14] If it was not by grace, those that had
[2:14:18] an opportunity of reading the books of
[2:14:22] the university until to the highest
[2:14:25] level
[2:14:27] that those one they can see it, those
[2:14:32] one that they couldn't had an
[2:14:33] opportunity are the one seeing the
[2:14:37] intelligency of heaven.
[2:14:43] That's all we need
[2:14:46] &gt;&gt; to further clarify.
[2:14:49] &gt;&gt; Notice specifically
[2:14:52] &gt;&gt; the words of Matthews 25
[2:14:56] &gt;&gt; 31-46 31-46. It does not say that
[2:15:00] shepherd
[2:15:02] is literally
[2:15:04] separating sheep from goat.
[2:15:07] But it says
[2:15:09] as a shepherd,
[2:15:13] sheep from goat.
[2:15:16] Some of the things are unfortunate to
[2:15:24] &gt;&gt; but they are like that.
[2:15:26] Maybe others are scared to say that. But
[2:15:29] I will tell you this morning, where does
[2:15:31] the church of the living God
[2:15:34] will be goats?
[2:15:40] Others know themselves. They are not
[2:15:42] here for a good cause. Now, brother
[2:15:46] Brennham says, "If you are a son of the
[2:15:49] living God, be careful, discern that
[2:15:54] spirit. Yeah.
[2:15:59] &gt;&gt; No, I will say it.
[2:16:01] &gt;&gt; I'm sorry.
[2:16:04] &gt;&gt; These are not sheep
[2:16:06] &gt;&gt; in this particular area of time.
[2:16:09] &gt;&gt; Why? Throne judgment
[2:16:11] in particular area of time. While throne
[2:16:13] judgment
[2:16:16] they should in his fold.
[2:16:21] They heard his voice, his way.
[2:16:24] Amen. And they followed him.
[2:16:27] They already have eternal life
[2:16:31] and cannot come into judgment.
[2:16:36] Brothers and sisters, a white throne
[2:16:39] judgment
[2:16:41] is for the sinners,
[2:16:43] not for you.
[2:16:45] You will not come in the white throne
[2:16:49] judgment in order to be judged. You will
[2:16:53] be there to judge.
[2:16:58] Live a good life. When you live a good
[2:17:01] life, that life is judgment to the
[2:17:04] people.
[2:17:08] But this do not have eternal life.
[2:17:14] And they are in the judgment.
[2:17:16] And they are allowed to go into the
[2:17:18] eternal life.
[2:17:21] But upon the ground they enter in
[2:17:24] eternal life.
[2:17:28] Certainly not upon the fact
[2:17:31] that they already have this eternal life
[2:17:35] like as does the
[2:17:40] mean. It means I give these things
[2:17:45] they happen. simultaneously
[2:17:48] as I've started this series until today
[2:17:52] in the end of time. This is what is
[2:17:54] happening. When you are with Christ
[2:17:58] Jesus
[2:17:59] as the bride, there are those people
[2:18:04] that did not get an opportunity
[2:18:07] but they are doing good things
[2:18:09] to you. Then God will say come. But they
[2:18:16] are not the bride
[2:18:23] &gt;&gt; but they receive it
[2:18:25] because they were kind of off his
[2:18:27] brethren.
[2:18:29] [Music]
[2:18:31] They are not his brethren
[2:18:36] that will make them joint with Jesus.
[2:18:43] They are not as to anything but life.
[2:18:50] They share no throne
[2:18:54] etc with him. Their names must have been
[2:19:00] in the book of life and not removed.
[2:19:05] Now because of their love of the people
[2:19:07] of God,
[2:19:09] they are recognized
[2:19:12] and saved.
[2:19:14] No doubt
[2:19:16] saved and helped
[2:19:19] the children of God perhaps like
[2:19:21] Nicodemus
[2:19:23] and Gamalian they stood for the children
[2:19:27] in a time of
[2:19:30] so in other words
[2:19:33] during the white throne judgment
[2:19:36] simultaneous
[2:19:38] occurrences
[2:19:42] there will be right
[2:19:45] that are with Jesus Christ on the
[2:19:48] throne.
[2:19:50] There will be those that God
[2:19:55] you know have mercy on them
[2:19:58] bring them but not being part of the
[2:20:01] bride
[2:20:04] just for life eternal.
[2:20:07] There will be those that are sinners
[2:20:12] from that time
[2:20:14] go to hell.
[2:20:17] Do you understand those things they
[2:20:20] happen simultaneously?
[2:20:23] And I repeat,
[2:20:25] what is happening there
[2:20:28] in the white throne judgment
[2:20:30] is what has happened before
[2:20:33] when you take a decision according to
[2:20:36] Revelation 12.
[2:20:40] God has a number of the bride. God has a
[2:20:45] number of the children of Israel like
[2:20:50] 144,0004.
[2:20:51] God has a number of the sinners that
[2:20:55] will go to hell. God has those numbers.
[2:21:01] And the Bible says it will go on like
[2:21:04] that until if possible. They will
[2:21:09] deceive
[2:21:11] the very elect.
[2:21:14] But it's obvious if it was possible.
[2:21:18] But it's impossible.
[2:21:20] a child of God remain a child of God
[2:21:24] will die a child of God will rise a
[2:21:27] child of God will spend his life eternal
[2:21:31] as a child of God
[2:21:38] if you fight me I just smile and say
[2:21:42] Lord God he's just showing his colors
[2:21:48] &gt;&gt; because my battle attach.
[2:22:02] [Applause]
[2:22:16] Children of God,
[2:22:18] can I repeat?
[2:22:20] Relax.
[2:22:27] &gt;&gt; I learned from the pastor always
[2:22:31] someone
[2:22:33] &gt;&gt; can speak at you.
[2:22:37] Later when you show him the truth,
[2:22:40] &gt;&gt; he won't say I'm sorry. So for you not
[2:22:43] to regret
[2:22:46] rather relax
[2:22:49] and you will see God doing miracles
[2:22:53] for he said to the children of Israel
[2:22:56] through Moses the Egyptians
[2:23:00] but you see you shall see them
[2:23:03] theor and the daughter will always be
[2:23:07] there against Moses when things goes bad
[2:23:11] they are the first people to
[2:23:16] But we have Joshua and Ka
[2:23:19] who said to children of God, the word of
[2:23:21] God is with Moses. Can we relax and
[2:23:26] listen to Moses?
[2:23:35] When we grow up,
[2:23:38] the elderly
[2:23:40] will just stand
[2:23:42] and put in here
[2:23:48] and say to this one, this one has just
[2:23:52] about you and he said
[2:23:57] and then the fight will start and then
[2:23:59] he'll stand.
[2:24:00] &gt;&gt; They are those people.
[2:24:05] lies
[2:24:07] &gt;&gt; and lies
[2:24:09] &gt;&gt; and he say this one he's saying about
[2:24:11] you and this one he's saying this about
[2:24:13] you
[2:24:14] &gt;&gt; and then the fight start
[2:24:24] I've learned to relax in the word of God
[2:24:27] and let God do the rest
[2:24:32] John chapter
[2:24:41] I I had few scriptures but I'm not going
[2:24:44] to read them.
[2:24:47] &gt;&gt; John chapter 17
[2:24:52] verse 12. Yeah, you can read for us.
[2:24:57] &gt;&gt; Verse 12.
[2:25:00] While I was with them in the world, I
[2:25:03] kept them in thy name. Those that thou
[2:25:06] gavest me, I have kept, and none of them
[2:25:09] is lost. But the son of pition that the
[2:25:13] scripture might be fulfilled.
[2:25:14] &gt;&gt; This scripture
[2:25:16] &gt;&gt; seal everything
[2:25:20] while
[2:25:22] this is Jesus.
[2:25:23] &gt;&gt; He's giving report
[2:25:25] to the father. He said, "Father, while I
[2:25:29] was with them in the well, I kept them
[2:25:34] in my name. Those that you have gave
[2:25:38] them to me,
[2:25:40] I have kept.
[2:25:42] None of them is lost except the son of
[2:25:48] Perish that the scripture should be
[2:25:51] fulfilled." Now, tell me and be honest
[2:25:55] with me this morning. What more do you
[2:25:57] want?
[2:26:01] Ah, let me stop here. Answer yourself
[2:26:04] when you go home. What more do you want?
[2:26:08] Jesus has kept you. God bless you.
[2:26:13] [Applause]
[2:26:27] Let's stand to our feet
[2:26:32] and sing a hymn.
[2:26:35] &gt;&gt; Amen.

[2:40:46] know assuredly that God hath made that
[2:40:48] same Jesus whom he have crucified both
[2:40:52] Lord and Christ. Now when they heard
[2:40:55] this, they were pricricked in their
[2:40:56] heart and said unto Peter and to the
[2:40:58] rest of the apostles, "Men and brethren,
[2:41:01] what shall we do?" Then Peter said unto
[2:41:04] them, "Repent and be baptized, every one
[2:41:07] of you, in the name of Jesus Christ, for
[2:41:09] the remission of sins, and ye shall
[2:41:11] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost. For
[2:41:14] the promise is unto you and to your
[2:41:17] children, and to all that are a far off,
[2:41:20] even as many as the Lord our God shall
[2:41:23] call.

[2:44:36] Because
[2:44:41] when the word is nice and going to the
[2:44:44] belly, it get bitter. Sometimes heavenly
[2:44:47] father, you do things contradicting
[2:44:51] ourself because Lord God, you know
[2:44:54] better than us. We may think about
[2:44:57] everything of this world or how to
[2:44:59] acquire them, but you taught us to look
[2:45:02] up to thee. Brother Brandham said,
[2:45:05] "Everything you see with a naked eye, it
[2:45:08] has a beginning, it will have an end."
[2:45:12] So we must look to the eternal
[2:45:14] inheritance.
[2:45:16] Lord God, here are two souls, heavenly
[2:45:19] father, whom you chose in this earth
[2:45:21] time. We know and we believe that one of
[2:45:25] the days the last sheep will come into
[2:45:27] the fold and the rapture will take us
[2:45:29] back home. when they come, heavenly
[2:45:32] father, we have that hope. Bless them,
[2:45:35] heavenly father. Equip them, Lord God,
[2:45:37] with the heavenly equipment so that they
[2:45:39] may be able to see the devil when he's
[2:45:42] still a far off. Lord God, I pray once
[2:45:45] more for the entire church. This church,
[2:45:48] heavenly father, you chose it before the
[2:45:51] foundation of the world. The devil may
[2:45:53] try whatever tricks he has. We know he
[2:45:56] never conquered. He will never conquer
[2:45:58] us. We love you so much. And I pray for
[2:46:02] our pastor. Such a man of wisdom.
[2:46:06] &gt;&gt; Help him heavenly father. Every moment
[2:46:09] we know when this moment like this come
[2:46:12] you show him more better and more
[2:46:15] clearer. That is why heavenly father
[2:46:18] even if the te the devil may try to put
[2:46:22] a stray he will say we must come back to
[2:46:24] life.
[2:46:26] We love you so much and we put
[2:46:28] everything Lord unto your capable hand.
[2:46:30] In the mighty name of our Lord and
[2:46:32] Savior Jesus Christ we pray. Amen.
[2:46:35] [Applause]
[2:46:41] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[2:46:43] &gt;&gt; Thank you so much Bazalwan.
[2:46:45] We have come to this time and uh we like
[2:46:49] to thank you for coming. Hallelujah.
[2:46:52] And we also pray for the Lord to be with
[2:46:55] you as we are driving back home.
[2:46:57] Hallelujah.
[2:46:59] &gt;&gt; My brother, I'm just going to ask you
[2:47:01] for two songs. Amen. The last song we
[2:47:05] just uh released the church. Those songs
[2:47:08] that are in your heart. God bless you.
[2:47:11] God bless you saints.
[2:47:16] &gt;&gt; I am thinking of the rapture in our
[2:47:20] blessed home. Oh, when they be
[2:47:25] I got the king.
[2:47:28] I will raise their heavenly
[2:47:32] in the city in the sky. Oh, the redee
