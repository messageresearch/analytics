[23:55] sudden stone and there was a rainbow
[23:57] round about The Throne inside like Anto

[26:09] and I saw a strong angel proclaiming
[26:12] with a loud voice who is worthy to open
[26:15] the book and to lose the souls thereof
[26:19] and no man in Heaven Nor in Earth
[26:21] neither under the Earth was able to open
[26:25] the book neither to look their own and I
[26:28] worked much because no man was found a
[26:31] way to open and to read the book neither
[26:34] to look there on and one of the elders
[26:37] said unto me with Lord Behold The Lion
[26:41] of the tribe of Judah the root of David
[26:43] has prevailed to open the book and to
[26:46] lose
[26:48] the seventh Souls thereof

[26:54] throne and on the fall of the four
[26:57] beasts and in the midst of the elders

[27:03] seven horns and seven eyes which are the
[27:06] seven spirits of God sent forth into all

[48:13] okay that's how lion if he is
[48:20] Advance up to this and the other one
[48:23] licking behind him
[48:28] but even the one that is lacking behind
[48:31] him
[48:34] shooting nothing
[48:36] lose hope
[48:46] is driving a small car
[48:51] one a big foreign
[49:17] I saw seven angels in the form of a
[49:20] pyramid that's brother Brenham speaking
[49:23] I think alone let's
[49:28] let it swapped It Down
[49:30] Speed and pick me up
[49:34] and I was brought East now later
[49:39] now we can go back to the Garden of Eden
[49:42] soon
[49:45] the Garden of Eden was placed Eastward
[49:48] so intimidated
[49:51] meaning there was West
[49:59] speaks of east and west coming together
[50:03] foreign
[50:13] [Music]
[50:24] foreign
[50:32] the angels
[50:35] took him then they lost them and he was
[50:39] taken both to east and west
[50:48] but finally
[50:52] he said UTI East and West
[50:57] has met
[51:01] the Angels Came
[51:04] and this year it says
[51:13] these angels
[51:16] swept down and picked me up and brought
[51:19] me East they think he lost the data they
[51:24] said
[51:29] he ended up being where
[51:32] foreign
[51:34] [Music]
[51:39] his headquarters the headquarters of
[51:42] Adam
[51:43] is
[51:48] so this man
[51:50] who came
[51:52] the seventh yes that's why it confused
[51:58] that he received a sword
[52:01] peoples
[52:07] foreign
[52:24] to the law of restoration
[52:29] God has to restore the sword again
[52:42] as human beings
[52:44] foreign
[52:58] not once
[53:05] that's why God
[53:08] has chosen the cross
[53:15] because the cross puts him in the middle
[53:20] [Music]
[53:23] and when he was in the body was in the
[53:27] grave
[53:28] um
[53:31] the prophet says now
[53:33] um
[53:36] the resurrection
[53:38] when he was in the grave yes
[53:44] his resurrection
[53:47] he was there to pull both sides in
[53:53] foreign
[53:59] is for both sides
[54:02] to be late to bring both sides together
[54:09] now he says his resurrection
[54:14] was through the other end of the
[54:16] sling yeah
[54:19] to connect to the other part
[54:24] meaning to bring God and Men together
[54:27] again Foods
[54:35] if you can receive such a revelation
[54:39] um
[54:41] you will never worry again about the
[54:44] things of the world
[54:50] three days
[54:52] in the
[54:54] the body in the grave
[54:56] yeah
[54:59] the thing was
[55:02] he was supposed to pull both
[55:06] that's why he went down foreign
[55:25] [Music]

[55:39] right let's go to this now
[55:43] I've got this here
[55:45] to open the seals
[55:49] for God
[55:56] one can say
[55:59] couldn't God open the sins himself
[56:05] well he said
[56:10] shall open the seals
[56:15] but the thing was
[56:19] how did he do it
[56:23] let's
[56:26] say a
[56:28] Revelation chapter 4 will connect with
[56:32] these things
[56:39] he says
[56:43] I was in the spirit
[56:49] the voice said to him
[56:52] come up
[56:56] ready
[56:58] [Applause]
[56:59] come up from the church ages

[57:11] from the church ages
[57:13] [Music]
[57:18] then I will show you things to come
[57:21] foreign
[57:25] but you should come to
[57:27] a place
[57:32] not the church ages
[57:36] if you can look at the church ages
[57:41] if you can look at the church ages
[57:45] right now
[57:48] what used to be Church ages
[57:53] you are looking at what you used to be
[58:00] that's why you see such a confusion
[58:07] because you are looking at what used to
[58:10] be the church ages
[58:16] all right
[58:19] you won't find the bride of Christ there
[58:24] because Revelation 21 says
[58:27] foreign

[58:44] [Music]
[59:06] you can't see it from a denomination
[59:12] I'll tell you something

[1:00:00] but it is no longer there
[1:00:04] because you'll find that these ones are
[1:00:08] Pentecostals they are going that way
[1:00:10] these ones Pentecostal is going that way
[1:00:12] and so forth is not Pentecostal
[1:00:16] record
[1:00:25] Ed

[1:02:11] all pointing to Pentecost
[1:02:17] is no longer that Pentecost
[1:02:23] amen amen we should also be watchful
[1:02:29] so that we don't remain pointing to the
[1:02:32] same prophets

[1:52:53] [Music]
[1:52:54] and coach
[1:52:56] your heart of redemption yeah

[1:53:17] possession

[1:54:16] you possess everything that Adam
[1:54:20] and Eve lost
[1:54:23] again

[1:54:58] [Applause]
[1:54:59] then it says
[1:55:02] what of it brother
[1:55:07] the possession of the deed
[1:55:18] after he has lost this book
[1:55:23] then it says it says that he could not
[1:55:27] meet the requirements Redemption
[1:55:39] without the seventh seal upon the world
[1:55:44] you we don't have the requirement yeah
[1:55:51] Redemption Lucia
[1:55:55] after he found he has lost it
[1:56:04] he has sinned
[1:56:13] and he separated himself from
[1:56:17] God
[1:56:22] and was on the side of the chasm
[1:56:30] he could not redeem it
[1:56:33] is
[1:56:35] he just couldn't do it
[1:56:39] because he needed Redemption himself
[1:56:46] after he has lost the book
[1:56:52] he himself
[1:56:59] without the seventh seal now
[1:57:05] you need Redemption
[1:57:11] amen amen there are people who Never
[1:57:15] Bound for preaching without Redemption
[1:57:19] preaching without the book

[1:57:23] they themselves need Redemption
[1:57:29] the law of God requires a Kingsman
[1:57:32] Redeemer
[1:57:34] um

[1:58:15] [Music]
[1:58:22] he died for the King's Men
[1:58:26] [Applause]
[1:58:27] because it is Of The Bloodline
[1:58:31] that's why Redemption to us
[1:58:34] comes through the seed of abrahamas
[1:58:39] and outside of that
[1:58:42] it's not Redemption
[1:58:44] it is their seed that is redeemed
[1:58:49] the seed is planted
[1:58:53] that is the law of redemption
[1:58:57] the very same seat back again
[1:59:02] now when we we were insane

[2:01:19] a Kingsman
[2:01:30] is a member of the family
[2:01:38] now it took another member of the family

[2:07:26] the Seed of Abraham
[2:07:30] is Christ
[2:07:34] and it is Abraham who saw God in the
[2:07:37] form of melchized
[2:07:42] so the Seed of Abraham
[2:07:47] are also entitled to see God
[2:07:53] in the form of

[2:09:40] [Applause]
[2:09:43] the inside of this man is Melchizedek
