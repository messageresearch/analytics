Description:
Title: Let There Be Light
Preached By Pastor Edgar Kuchingale at Mamelodi Tabernacle on Sunday 19 May 2024.

The Pastor read the following scriptures:

Genesis 1: 1 - 5  John 8:12 Matthew 5:4  1 John 2:8  Isaiah 60:1

The purpose of the sermon was to show the people about the rising of the light which is the word.

The spirit of God was moving upon the waters. which waters stand for the people. The spirit of God moved upon the pentecostal but there was no light. Church order is God' spoken word. 

Pentecostal disorder was set in order by the prophet of Malachi 4:5. The foolishness of the galatians was set in order by Paul, because Paul was the light of the day.

Darkness represent the denomination. That is why all the time the devil is trying to bring denominationalism in the message of the hour. If you are living in the light you have nothing to hide.

We are supposed to be intercessors and interceed for others. Denominationalism is when a person become a prosecuter and a persecuter. 

Before the earth can give light to the people in darkness, the earth must be first in the light which is the word. You can not give out light when you are not in the word. When you walk in the light you become the light which is the word.

You are a messenger of either good news or bad news. if you say bad news that is what is in you. If heaven send you as an ambassador all the power of heaven is behind you.

Your faith controls your imagination, your reasoning, your affection and memory. Your faith must control your hearing. As the faith is growing it will burst out to outgrow the spirit and body. If you loose your soul you will die. You soul that is you. Inside of you there is either light or darkness. The more you take in the word the more you let light come in and darkness goes away.

You should be able to see yourself in the word. That light that was spoken in genesis is actually you.

The pastor quoted the following spoken words:

hallelujah amen amen amen uh uh let me welcome everyone of you now let's go back to the book which we love amen amen amen um uh always I would want to start from the book of Genesis let's go to Genesis 1 verse one verse one amen amen Genesis 1 verse one yes in the beginning God created the Heaven and the Earth yes two two and the Earth was without form and void and darkness was upon the face of the deep and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters three and God God said let there be light and there was light four and God saw the light that it was good and God divided the light from the darkness amen God yes and God called the light day and the Darkness he called night and the evening and the morning were the first day hallelujah amen amen let us pray gra Heavenly Father we we have read this word with all what our teacher taught us in school but now we need another teacher amen that's the Holy Ghost let it come down and teach each and every one of us now as we are waiting for that day shall see your holy face Amen in Jesus CH name we pray amen amen hallelujah amen amen you can be seated amen [Music] hallelujah amen H how many don't me to feel at home I'm already more than at home amen because actually don't be segregationist you count me out no no no no says you make a bigger CLE Church your ministry is not limited to the small country called South Afric South Africa is too small for this church hallelujah amen hallelujah amen hallelujah amen hallelujah amen how many here have ever been ever been have the privilege of being a big brother big big brother no small small brother not but little big brothers those of us have been that PR you will know your father will tell you hey my brother your young brother now Needs school fees so you start paying school fees even before you start for paying for your own children because you are an elder brother you look after the younger brothers yes you go and look after them amen and your father will be happy that you're not just looking after yourself but you're not you're looking after the family this church your ministry shouldn't be limiting to this one hey my brother if you're not paying TI please pay because one this Church to get into that responsibility to look after churches in MO amen amen if you go help you are unlucky hallelujah amen so your ministry shouldn't be just about this church be bigger look Beyond South Africa because God has put you to be so hallelujah amen so in the beginning amen says when God created the world in the beginning I don't know how many years or billions of years or that there in the beginning so even if they say the Earth is billion years old don't worry it's all [Music] right it's our time which we are counting we're not counting the creation of the earth if you want to find the quotation um you can go to 63 1229 there is man amen let's go there um go to around paragra 60 amen amen I'm waiting for my brothers to give me the scripture there I'll come to that quite a lot so it might it have been billions of years it's up to him it's not for us for us we are coming to where he's talking about us amen amen when said let there be light hallelujah amen hallelujah amen today our my whole aim of the whole message is to let you know when God said let there be light he was talking about you amen amen amen it's going to give me trouble can you go down a little bit go down go down yes 62 now some people argue today in our schools about the world being so many million years old trying to condemn the Bible they just never read the Bible That's all because the Bible don't tell us how old the world is the Bible said in the beginning God created the heavens and the earth when how we don't know it now that's first and that's period that's the end of the sentence in the beginning God created the heavens and the Earth it might have been 100 million years whatever it was how done it that's up to him to know see not to me Allelujah amen that's not up to me to know how he created the for me I have to know how he will save me you know we are so blind we we are very completely blind um as I was saying yesterday they can take a telescope put it in a blind spot where this Darkness they find that there are billions and billions of galaxies there amen so we are men every day we discover new things amen amen uh just two days ago they discover something which was uh very important which they didn't know they call they call it Point amen point is where the pool of the Earth and the Sun are [Music] equal you can go and stay there without spending much energy because not be pulling much that's they did put the J telescope it's there forever because it's in point God already knew there was such point because it's him who created the world so we are discuss so new things but come to the word they don't give chance to the way to change them hallelujah amen hallelujah amen so we go back to 59 on the same scripture my brother9 59 yes let me start from there now remember light comes by the spoken word what how does light come the spoken words yes amen light is the Vindication or the subject that he spoke is light when light flies shows that God said let there be light there was no light he said let there be light and there was light that's a [Music] proof the light is a Vindication of the spoken word the same thing today Vindication of his spoken word hallelujah amen so let's discuss another chapter when Isaiah said Isaiah 6:1 Isaiah 6:1 let's go there s arise Shine for thy light is come amen and the glory of the Lord is raisen upon theme amen hallelujah amen was he talking about the son no he was talking about himself that he was the light to the Jews amen hallelujah amen he was light to the Jews so when you see his word being the let me be there when you see his word being [Music] Vindicated or in other words made known or proved that is the light of his spoken word when our young people the way they are telling the world this is light and without light nothing can live without light all the life which is on Earth is there because there's a sun okay let me stop there I hope I remember to come back to this amen um the sun which you see uh today uh the sun is a huge star which about a million can go in there the nuclear fusion which happens in the sun to give us light today happened about 10 to 100 million years ago just imagine God already Was preparing a son which seeing today when did that nuclear fusion happen which is giving us light today tell it happened long time ago tell me that there's nobody who planned this this is all planned it's all synchronized hallelujah amen you are not here by mistake so when the sun came when the sun comes to the Earth there is a way which we trap the energy when we how we trap the energy it's through the plants and we change the energy from the plants to become our food that's why they call the food chain so that's a way we live on on on the sun without this light nothing can live there's no life upon the Earth but that has come by the Light of the Sun in a b life so and there is no eternal life outside the sun of God amen amen we are going to talk about that he is the light amen amen so it is the light it is our light hallelujah amen uh I want to go on my brother I want to go up to 64 before I leave this B ah no no no I want to go slowly go to 61 let me go 61 yeah so we find out the Earth was without form until the light came let's stop there hallelujah amen so the Earth was there but it was without form until the word came hallelujah amen Peter P Andrew Andrew James James John Johan there were in the word they were in the what in the word hallelujah amen hallelujah hallelujah so the church was going on but the church was without form until PA comes to say no my brother this way the deons this way the women this way you see the rising of the sun the sun has come to set things right the Earth was there Peter would pray for the sick the sick would be healed Philip will translate that way this way Paul comes they without form seases because light has come now so when Paul comes he comes to set the things right the son had risen on the message of the hour you find that uh the Pentecostal had received the Holy Ghost and actually the church was there on fire one has got a song one has got a prophecy somebody has got this they just stand up any time say whatever they want to do sit down comes Brothers No the light has come it is the rising of the sun there's a man who can turn on the light turn on the light because the light some people today okay let's go down to 633 63 okay go down a little bit well yes but the world uh the Earth was without form and void and the spirit of God was moving what what was happening when there was chaos people are fearing the spirit was moving when there is so much chaos but the spirit is moving and when the spirit was moving God realiz there's so much CH here let light come Hallelujah so the The Light Came where already the spirit of God was moving upon the waters water stands for people so it was among the people the spirit of the Lord was moving but there was no light the spirit of God was moving in the P church but there was no light but now it is the rising of the sun things have to be set in order Hallelujah so the light is to come to set things in order hallelujah amen uh let's go to the it is it is go to the it is the rising of the sun my brother is the rising of the sun um 6 65 just go to the end 65 04 68 0518 it is the rising of the sun Par 38 rising of the sun paragraph 88 8 38 38 3 38 38 amen amen I'll be waiting for you my brother 38 38 so Church order Church order is God's spoken word the light is God's spoken word Pentecostal disorder Pentecostal disorder was set in order by the prophet Mal 45 the disorder in the first church most manifested in the Corinthian Church was settled by Paul the foolishness of the Galatians was settled by Paul because light Paul was the light of the day amen amen a lot of us would prefer Peter but God chose Paul hallelujah amen amen especially those of you who are with me in the Catholic Church you don't want to go away from Peter but no no amen amen hallelujah amen hallelujah amen how many people saw the light in that day PO on the road to Damascus so the amen amen and the first light ever given to the Earth was God's spoken [Music] words the first light that ever struck the Earth was God's spoken word he said let there be light and there was light that turn Darkness into light in order to bring forth creation joy and life upon the Earth then the spirit of God it as it moved with love and compassion on that great day the first day of the dawn of creation upon the Earth the Sun LS swept ac across its ra dried up the waters from the earth made the atmosphere above for the first time it was to bring joy and life to the end by the seed we'll come back at the at the end we go to the seed that was a great hour no no no let's say this is a great hour amen amen what does darkness represent dark darkness represents nominations if you want a quotation go to stand still and see9 and darkness is denomination of B that is why all the time the devil is trying to make sure he brings back the denominationalism into the message of the hour because he has to fight the message if I am a brother in the message of the hour and I associate with another brother from another church theage of I'm denomination [Music] I denomination because I I I belong to my church I don't belong to the light I don't belong to the word hallelujah amen denomination of barriers to protect sin amen hallelujah amen if you see somebody embracing everybody just know he has got nothing to hide hallelujah amen he's living in the light if you are living in the light amen amen my brother are you on paragraph oh oh no no no no no no I didn't take my pick my paragraph properly denomination of barriers are bringing us apart we battle this side that side it's time to stand still okay I've forgotten the paragraph but uh just go to 10 on the light on the light turn on the light 64125 paragraph 21 here I forgot I didn't write the pram amen amen and and I'm telling the truth my brother we are supposed to be intercessors praying for our brothers interceding for them remember we are not Kings only we are priest Kings we need to rule but at the same time be intercessors and people have known the word of the hour so much but unfortunately instead of becoming an intercessor they become a prut do you know what the prut doesn't we found him we found him we found and we have evidence and sometimes they even go on to not only to become prosecutors but being persecutors that's denominationalism amen amen that's the same thing with the word with the word when the word of God lies it is the rising of the sun theising all Superstition denomination of fism and things spread away it shows exactly what it is what in the beginning say let there be light amen amen God separated light from darkness in the beginning hallelujah amen amen um those of you who have got houses especially sisters you go to the kitchen [Music] go there at night you might find that there's a fellow small Fellowship there just turn on the light you see the Ls going that way going that way they can't stand the lights amen they can't stand the light the light separates us amen amen amen amen so in the beginning God said Let It Be Right amen amen let's go to John 8 12 John 8:12 then spake Jesus again unto them saying yes I am the light of the world Hallelujah he that followeth me shall not walk in darkness but shall have the light of Life hallelujah amen amen amen amen hallelujah amen uh let's go back to the same creation again um when Jesus is the light hallelujah amen but him being the light he attracts otherss others put on lights of your headlamps you see creatures of life learning towards you creatures of Darkness learning isn't it hallelujah amen so when the creatures of light come in the light you can see them not because they got light because the light is reflecting on them hallelujah amen the light of the real light is reflecting upon them so you might be somewhere in the Sun is far but they can see the reflection on someone who is attracted by the Light even if the light is far um if you can go on the planet uh let's just take Mars uh the Earth is mostly glass because it's made of water and the clouds so on the Maran night if you see a very huge B star in the in the sky planet [Music] Earth because the Earth is working in the light and is able to give light to those who are in darkness first the Earth has to be in the light in the word before it gives out light to those who are in darkness before you give light to the those are in darkness you yourself have to walk in the light and the light is the word of God hallelujah amen amen Matthew 5 Matthew 5 uh 14 14 you cannot give light if you don't work if you don't walk in the word there's no way can give light the only way you can give light is when you are in the word we walk in the light beautiful light when you are walking in the light what do you become what is the light spoken word amen amen amen Jesus said what did he say ye are the light of the world St there who is the light to the world okay those of you who are from pror up hands who is a li to the Jesus you want Jesus to come come to so who is there you you are the light remember now the light which was in the Lord came into the lhost the Loos has come created the Earth and the Sun and then the Sun is up to us the word which was in God John 1:1 the word now is in us so we are the word to the other people who is the word we are the word oh no no Jesus is the word but if a SE remains alone it has to come and be everywhere so today in a country which people can't even dressed up like South Africa there are people walking dressed upall why they wa amen hey the Democracy Afric is too much amen you know we are ambassadors amen so South Africa is not a good example but Malawi is a very good example mean Ambassador living in Mala where food is scarce the cars are a little bit more battered do you think anide Mal no he will drive an American car he eat American food is hallelujah amen uh my brother Hebrews chapter 2 part one chapter part one part one chapter paragraph 37 paragraph 37 so if there's hunger in Malawi like this year the americ say oh what am I going to do there's hunger in Malawi is he is he sympathizing with us yes no no he's another in another state of economy because he is in another and actually uh Pia is a very good example if you go you move around in pitor here have you ever seen an ambassador's house completely identified it's not like your house which you hide your name the ambassador's house is supposed to be clearly identified the ambassador's house they even is a flag this is an American you know lay a flag there the flag is like that until even the thie if you wanted to steal from him they would be having problem Ambassador is clearly identified secret Believers what do you mean how Secret believer an ambassador when he's in a car Ambassador Ambassador even the number plate those very tough uh policemen of this Metropolitan there's a number plate for Ambassador can come and say that will be a diplomatic [Music] crisis hallelujah amen uh chapter 2 part part one part one and then paragraph 37 paragraph 37 amen paragraph 37 an ambassador is clearly identified if you see somebody is says I work at mean Embassy and there's no flag upon him no there's not an ambassador because if he was an ambassador they should have been a flag you see when whenever we meet a sister we see the flag Rising yeah the flag is amen a messenger let's go to the prophet there you are a messenger this morning you are a messenger of good news or a messenger of bad news yeah those of you are coming out with stories what happened to me what happened to that one how happened you either give out good news that means you message of good news or you are a message of bad news because in you there's bad news all the time you talk about the pastor is negative it's because in you there's no good news so you are a messenger either of good news or bad news Choose Yourself am isn't it oh isn't it beautiful we are ambassadors that we are read you yourself we are where are the Angels amen amen we are angels we are God's Messengers to the sinful South Africa God doesn't have any other Messengers to this country except you he brings us from the Lord bch life of sin and exalts US above in our souls and makes us creatures we are messengers we are

if the United States United States of this Fair land sent me over to Russia as an ambassador of this nation to Russia then if they officially sent me to Russia all the power that the United States has uned States is behind me so if heaven sent me all the power of Heaven is behind me my word is just as the same of the United States United States amen hallelujah amen hallelujah amen sent Messengers

Jesus for the remission of your sin and you shall receive the gift of Holy Ghost I'm moving somebody from hell to heaven I'm not giving that Visa of yours to United [Music] States I'm giving a visa to Heaven etal [Music] [Applause] life Hallelujah I'm not an ambassador to issue out remission of your sins the Pharisees they came to Jesus and they contradict him they he told them what if I would say woman your sins have been limited and today I am here remitting the sins just [Applause] here amen amen the light of the day has come the LI you know the first light which came which is in Genesis that light came for pumpkins apples oranges for us to be yes it was it came for us to be eating that the F light the second sun lose on the Easter morning and all the seed which was in the ground which was job Abraham they all L with because their son had Reen for us now this is the rising of our sons this is this son ising of pumpkins anymore no this is now [Music] anothering from mortality to immortality amen amen amen amen where is the seat Hallelujah okay uh let me let me talk about something and then I'll come back to this subject uh one day brother Bram was preaching uh the seven church hges and he wrote on board in the front how the seven churches were after brother finished preaching a light came to write the same things back on the board the back a light came and after some another day it was it was written in the skies by the moon that's how the seven Church ages came God vindicating himself that the word has come and when you come to the mystery of the Kingdom of Heaven I believe you know the the mystery of the Kingdom of Heaven is divided in seven Parts The Mystery of the so and the seed The Mystery of the tears and the wheat The Mystery of the the great of the Mard seed The Mystery of the Le uh the Myster of the hidden treasure the mystery of the the pair [Music] of let me go through them quickly is there any got another function after this [Music] church okay let me just go there so the the Myster of the S this is genuine seed which is shown some for on the ground some on the on the way some on the stor that's the same way the way we are preaching here we are throwing a good seed but some some hearts are made of stone some some some of you are just passes by so they you just take taken away but when we come to the to the tears and the the wheat they are things which are a little bit similar but where we are growing to go today today is the mystery of the grain of the mustard but when it grows it grows very very big but where does this seed grow where is the where is the the Earth is here because if you go to the Book of Ezekiel you tell God was telling Ezekiel to take the word and put them in the vessel of hallelujah amen where does the word stay within us that is why when he was opening the seals where did he get the book from himself Hallelujah am so can I have that picture my brother um the Earth inside the earth which we are in yeah so uh the seed yes yeah there yeah you are in an earth okay is it there is it Che up okay so the body is the Earth the spirit you can get it from your country you can have South African Spirit of your spirit evil spirit there are so many of them they can be Millions because on five five it tells us there can even be a thousand speed inside [Music] you so if you are a man a little South Afric girl your taste your sight controls you whatever you hear that's what you do whenever you smell KFC it controls you your taste controls you you are what southa Afric South Africa amen if you're South African you know afri when you go you know when South Africa uh not not not people of this church but uh sometimes people from somewhere I not let me not say that because people have go taste taste that when they come in your house you don't know what they say oh this food is malawian we you know we South Africans can't eat malaan food these borders which David Livingston did put are too much you know the borders were not supposed to be there they even they were even discussed in Brussels they not discussed by our ancestors and somebody thinks that South Africa is another continent and uh his taste is not he eat the body is controlling amen amen you know this body has got too many things it looks for this body this body looks for a lot so if a man the body controls you your touch controls you after the body now comes the other world then the next control in the spirit in the spirit you are controlled by your imagination your reasoning amen amen that is where a lot of us have gone wrong you know before God we are and we want our reason to take control okay what if my one of my chicken at home can wake up in the morning T the other chickens hey friends I've decided that we should move out from this house do you think a chicken can survive ons but the chicken things is wise enough he can move out of the house and the two chickens they move out they find there's a there's a big cat there in Mala there are those big cats wild cats out of you immediately [Music] Hallelujah do you have those big cats they are cats little little Cuts can cut the chicken because the chicken didn't Reon properly because under under my house they were protected but they moved out of the because one the chick I've decided now we should be living on our own your affection controls you amen amen um here affection is very very bad that's where all tribalism comes in if I can ask you how how did your tribe start you never tell me it must have been somebody who was drunk just tell themselves hey from today onwards I am a Zulu say how did he start you don't even know maybe somebody was so drunk and that's the way things start so your affection is also can control you but when things have changed if inside you there's a seed of Faith then your faith controls your imagination now you imagine like a Believer if you are looking for a wife you look you look for a wife who who is a Believer your faith is controlling your imagination when you are good faith your faith controls your reasoning controls your affection controls even your memories some of you what you can remember about me is all my mistakes which I have a priv not to remember but you are remembering I forgot about those long time ago but you come and tell me hey baba you remember 1920 you had this mistake I'm sorry I can't remember that mistake that means the mistake has been living in you the mistake my mistake has been living amen so your faith should control your memory your faith should control your conscience your faith should control your healing amen of course uh you are not you cannot be listen to the township [Music] music you know there Down music it's there at home there at home there there's music which circulates in the township which some of them we don't understand what they say but find people are been dancing but some of us don't even know this is there because what you want to hear now my faith is controlling my head amen hallelujah am so what is the faith doing as the faith is growing it grows bigger what will we do it will burst out from this reversal so my body will become smaller my will become smaller but now my soul me my soul will become bigger soul is you if you lose your soul you are going to die but Spirits can come on you and go out remember when the spirit went out of he was all right seven went out of she was all right so you can have Spirits they come and go but Soul that's you you are a soul the light that is why brother was saying
