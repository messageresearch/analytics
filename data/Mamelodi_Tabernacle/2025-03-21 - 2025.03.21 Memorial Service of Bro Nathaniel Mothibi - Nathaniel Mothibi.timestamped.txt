[50:19] 1980 198
[50:22] [Music]
[50:27] high school he was at school at Mal high
[50:29] school and then by by
[50:37] [Music]
[50:38] somehow they happen to have riots at
[50:41] school and they were
[50:44] arrested they went to
[50:49] jail and his father passed
[50:52] away and he was unable to bury his own
[50:55] father
[50:57] our hearts were really
[51:01] broken the government wouldn't allow to
[51:04] release him even when he Wasing he's
[51:05] going to bury his father so when he came
[51:09] back and
[51:12] then he changed the school he
[51:15] attended went to another school before
[51:19] but before he could change the school he
[51:20] came with the message of the
[51:23] hour hallelujah amen and then
[51:27] he said to
[51:30] me don't you want to be
[51:34] baptized he used to attend an Apostolic
[51:43] church I think maybe even the family
[51:46] members don't know that
[51:48] part I said to
[51:51] him I can be baptized but
[51:58] to me I didn't even think that he's
[52:01] referring to baptism at the apostolic
[52:04] church and I didn't even ask him at
[52:07] which
[52:10] church when he asked me don't you want
[52:12] to be baptized I realize what he
[52:14] saying is different from Apostolic
[52:17] church it's different from zcc church
[52:21] and I said to him I want to be
[52:22] baptized hallelujah amen and then

[53:20] [Applause]
[53:22] using the message was serious
[53:26] just showing the
[53:36] way hallelujah
[53:39] amen and I grew up that
[53:45] way until I completed my secondary
[53:49] school when I then went to
[53:54] ter that's when the tape meeting
[53:57] stopped and he's the one who taught me
[54:01] there so he brought me up he's my
[54:07] father brother to my
[54:11] father they were born in their family
[54:13] being
[54:17] nine they have two sisters ahead
[54:21] of and then it was my
[54:23] uncle and then my father
[54:26] and then my other
[54:30] uncle and then the other
[54:34] Uncle the father to the brother who
[54:37] welcom and then
[54:39] him he's the ninth one amen amen and
[54:45] then so he brought me
[54:53] up I don't remember a time when we
[54:55] disagreed
[55:04] I will enjoy
[55:07] him he won't be angry at
[55:10] [Music]
[55:12] you but he once beat
[55:19] me we were heading
[55:24] cattles but some how we got some C
[55:30] lost and he found me there and gave me a
[55:32] good beating and

[55:41] I that is the only time I remember when
[55:43] he gave me a good but all of all of the
[55:51] timey and always I remember him
[55:57] scri Philippians chter

[1:18:31] book of
[1:18:40] John I IID like to read from verse 61 up
[1:18:45] to
[1:18:52] 63 John chapter 6 6: 61 up to
[1:18:59] 63 when Jesus knew in himself that his
[1:19:02] disciples murmured at it he said unto
[1:19:05] them do this offend you what and if you
[1:19:10] shall see the son of man Ascend up where
[1:19:12] he was
[1:19:13] before it it is a spirit that quickeneth
[1:19:17] the flesh profiteth nothing the words
[1:19:20] that I speak unto you they are spirits
[1:19:22] and they are life Hallelujah okay we may
[1:19:25] be
[1:19:33] seated uh it's a memorial
[1:19:39] service it's a service that
[1:19:44] is uh in memory with what has occurred
[1:19:54] departure of our beloved
[1:20:00] brother uh the paper that he just given
[1:20:05] me it says that we can push up to
[1:20:11] 9:00 but I don't think I'll push
[1:20:17] up
[1:20:19] will okay so uh our brother uh
[1:20:27] T is well known in our
[1:20:30] service for his
[1:20:34] dedication and for his hard
[1:20:40] working you all know
[1:20:43] him now that he has
[1:20:46] Departed the family and the
[1:20:51] church uh see it a good that we should
[1:20:57] meet and just say something about
[1:21:01] him as the friends and the families were
[1:21:04] saying something about
[1:21:06] him believer have rendered some musical
[1:21:12] items the last part now is that we uh
[1:21:16] just go to the
[1:21:18] we and read the
[1:21:21] scripture and hear what the Lord has to
[1:21:23] say to
[1:21:25] [Music]
[1:21:26] uh I want to speak about the
[1:21:29] resurrection of
[1:21:34] Life the the Bible say our Lord Jesus
[1:21:39] Christ once
[1:21:42] said I am the bread of
[1:21:46] life and there was a
[1:21:49] time where he took
[1:21:52] bread and gave them
[1:21:55] and said eat
[1:21:59] this uh referring to the
[1:22:03] bread as his
[1:22:08] flesh and he gave them
[1:22:11] wine and he said they should
[1:22:14] drink that was referring to
[1:22:17] his
[1:22:20] Spirit but he never explain those things
[1:22:24] and there was a
[1:22:27] time where our great great
[1:22:33] grandfather
[1:22:35] Adam for the title
[1:22:42] de so after he forf the
[1:22:48] title it was not
[1:22:52] lost it went back to God
[1:22:56] himself that titled
[1:22:59] it and then it it it was our
[1:23:06] inheritance so God took it back to
[1:23:10] himself because his
[1:23:15] son fated
[1:23:17] it and the devil wanted
[1:23:20] it so then
[1:23:24] we were now given a
[1:23:29] task our task was that
[1:23:33] now we should proclaim a
[1:23:38] life that is
[1:23:41] worthy that we can receive back that
[1:23:44] title
[1:23:48] de that is our
[1:23:52] inheritance and that that that title
[1:23:56] did in order that we should get it
[1:24:00] back we need to
[1:24:04] fight so it's only for
[1:24:09] those that will win in that
[1:24:12] [Music]
[1:24:14] fight
[1:24:16] because there are two
[1:24:19] forces that is the force of our beloved
[1:24:22] God
[1:24:25] and the force of the
[1:24:27] devil the devil wants that
[1:24:31] title and then God has got that
[1:24:35] title but he want to give it to
[1:24:38] us but we have to be
[1:24:43] worthy that is why
[1:24:46] now we are the
[1:24:48] bride which is worthy to receive
[1:24:53] that so now God
[1:24:56] himself became the
[1:25:00] intercessor he became our
[1:25:05] mediator so now being the
[1:25:09] mediator he is the one that saw that we
[1:25:13] are worthy to receive the
[1:25:18] ti so now in that title
[1:25:22] de There Is No Death
[1:25:25] no it's only
[1:25:28] life that's why when death
[1:25:32] came it was just
[1:25:35] darkness but now we speaking about the
[1:25:39] resurrection of
[1:25:42] life it was
[1:25:44] life in the Garden of
[1:25:46] Eden but when death
[1:25:49] came it seems to be a doom
[1:25:55] that is why
[1:25:57] now we are
[1:25:59] believers we believe the word of
[1:26:02] God now the
[1:26:05] script uh the word of God or the Bible
[1:26:10] itself is the word of
[1:26:14] God there was a
[1:26:16] time I want to read the scripture before
[1:26:19] I come to this
[1:26:21] one it's in in in in verse 29 in the
[1:26:25] same chapter more verse 29 chapter 6 can
[1:26:29] you read it for us my brother just start
[1:26:32] from verse
[1:26:36] 28 then said they unto him what shall we
[1:26:39] do that we might work the works of God
[1:26:42] yeah now now these people they were
[1:26:45] asking our Lord Jesus
[1:26:47] Christ they said to him because he
[1:26:51] started by saying unto them
[1:26:54] labor not for the meat which in verse 27
[1:26:58] labor not for the meat which
[1:27:05] perishes in other words when when you
[1:27:10] live you don't
[1:27:13] live uh that at the end of your
[1:27:17] life it should be a life that perished
[1:27:25] when you
[1:27:26] leave you should know that
[1:27:29] now after you your your spirit has gone
[1:27:34] out of this
[1:27:36] body then you should be proud of
[1:27:41] yourself that the separation of your
[1:27:45] body your
[1:27:48] spirit it's not a lost it's not death
[1:27:54] you should
[1:27:56] know where your spirit
[1:27:59] goes and you should know where your soul
[1:28:04] goes but it is the spirit that
[1:28:10] Quicken are we together the spirit
[1:28:16] Quicken so now when you are
[1:28:20] alive you should
[1:28:23] know that that and you should
[1:28:26] feel
[1:28:29] supernaturally that you are
[1:28:32] quickened you don't meditate about
[1:28:36] death you meditate about life after
[1:28:42] death there is life after
[1:28:46] death there's there's your
[1:28:50] inheritance there are different bodies
[1:28:57] right and there are different
[1:29:01] dispensations and there are different
[1:29:06] places our Lord Jesus
[1:29:09] Christ used to get in and out of
[1:29:12] different
[1:29:16] dispensations and you to go into
[1:29:19] different
[1:29:22] bodies one day he met his
[1:29:25] disciples they were going to to
[1:29:29] ous then he spoke to
[1:29:32] them in another
[1:29:35] body they could not see
[1:29:37] [Music]
[1:29:38] him right he went down with
[1:29:42] them preaching the word unto
[1:29:44] them on and on and on until they reach
[1:29:48] their
[1:29:50] destination after reaching their
[1:29:52] destination
[1:29:54] then he exposed
[1:29:56] himself and then they saw him then he
[1:30:00] vanished he get to another
[1:30:03] body his
[1:30:07] disciples were hidden somewhere were
[1:30:09] hiding
[1:30:12] somewhere door
[1:30:15] locked and then he just came in and said
[1:30:19] peace be with
[1:30:22] you and then they said no this this is a
[1:30:25] ghost he said give me fish and bread
[1:30:29] then he ate and said a fish can't
[1:30:33] eat I mean a ghost can't
[1:30:36] eat how did he get through that door
[1:30:40] because it was
[1:30:42] locked now he will he will will go into
[1:30:45] different
[1:30:47] dimensions now to show
[1:30:50] us that there are certain
[1:30:56] dispensations and there are certain
[1:31:00] Dimensions at times he will walk upon
[1:31:03] the
[1:31:04] sea you don't walk upon
[1:31:07] water you
[1:31:09] swim he will walk upon
[1:31:11] water what type of a body that will walk
[1:31:14] upon
[1:31:16] water that is just to tell
[1:31:19] you that life here is a temporary life
[1:31:25] there are greater
[1:31:28] things Beyond
[1:31:31] Death this
[1:31:35] body actually is delaying
[1:31:41] us this place here called
[1:31:45] Earth is delaying us we've got a better
[1:31:52] place so those are the things that we
[1:31:55] need to meditate
[1:31:57] about we've got a better
[1:32:00] place we've got a better
[1:32:04] father we've got a better
[1:32:08] Dimension that's what we need to H
[1:32:11] meditate
[1:32:13] about now our
[1:32:16] brother he's been in the
[1:32:19] service on every
[1:32:22] weekend never miss
[1:32:26] now it's the only
[1:32:29] time where he said I am now in a better
[1:32:34] place I
[1:32:40] wish that that's that's our place then
[1:32:44] now we read the scripture
[1:32:46] again it
[1:32:49] says uh I think it's chapter 6 yes verse
[1:32:53] 29 yes
[1:32:54] yes it says
[1:32:58] here okay they were saying to him he
[1:33:00] said no le not for the verse 27 labor
[1:33:04] not for the meat which
[1:33:08] perishes but for the meat which enure
[1:33:13] it un everlasting
[1:33:17] life which is which the son of man shall
[1:33:22] give unto you
[1:33:25] the son of man shall give you
[1:33:29] life that enure
[1:33:33] it everlasting
[1:33:36] life for him God
[1:33:39] has
[1:33:44] sealed the son of
[1:33:47] man it's a
[1:33:49] person who God is in him
[1:33:54] our Lord Jesus Christ it was Jesus who
[1:33:58] came in a bodily
[1:34:00] form and when God
[1:34:04] descended he descended in the form of a
[1:34:08] spirit because God is a
[1:34:11] spirit they that worship Him should
[1:34:14] worship Him in
[1:34:17] truth and in spirit or in spirit and
[1:34:22] Truth Now when he was in
[1:34:25] Jesus he was the son of
[1:34:28] man now the Bible here
[1:34:31] says labor
[1:34:33] not for the food or the meat which
[1:34:38] perishes don't waste your
[1:34:41] time about something that you're going
[1:34:44] to
[1:34:45] lose don't waste your
[1:34:48] time living here on Earth knowing
[1:34:52] exactly that you don't know where you
[1:34:56] going you have to be
[1:34:59] sure that when you go where are you
[1:35:03] going
[1:35:05] right you don't have to
[1:35:08] guess you don't have
[1:35:12] to no you have to be
[1:35:17] sure where is your soul
[1:35:20] going because a being
[1:35:24] is in a three-fold
[1:35:27] manner the only thing that you know is
[1:35:29] that your body will get into the
[1:35:32] grave but what about the destination of
[1:35:34] your
[1:35:36] spirit what about the destination of
[1:35:38] your
[1:35:40] soul that's the thing that you need
[1:35:45] to so now that if you know about
[1:35:50] it the Bible says it enjoy
[1:35:55] en it unto everlasting
[1:35:57] life you will only get it from the son
[1:36:01] of
[1:36:02] man but the son of
[1:36:05] man the father has sealed
[1:36:10] him when he says has sealed
[1:36:14] him that's the fight I'm talking
[1:36:17] about when something is
[1:36:21] sealed the Bible says
[1:36:25] some
[1:36:27] are
[1:36:30] ordained for
[1:36:34] condemnation some are ordained for
[1:36:38] eternal
[1:36:41] life in
[1:36:44] heaven it was God and
[1:36:47] cherubs and
[1:36:49] sarim and then some of the cherubs
[1:36:55] some of the
[1:36:57] Angels took a wrong
[1:37:01] direction when they took a wrong
[1:37:04] direction they took the way of
[1:37:10] condemnation and the
[1:37:12] remainder took the
[1:37:15] right that is eternal
[1:37:18] life so now the system is like
[1:37:22] that the fight was in
[1:37:25] heaven
[1:37:27] those that were rebellious rebelling
[1:37:30] against
[1:37:32] God and those that were siding with
[1:37:36] God they were spirits and those Spirits
[1:37:40] came down and when those Spirits came
[1:37:42] down they incarnated human being
[1:37:47] on when they incarnated human being it
[1:37:51] divided human beings
[1:37:54] into
[1:37:55] two there are those that are
[1:37:59] driven by by the by those spirits that
[1:38:04] Rebels against God there are those that
[1:38:07] are driven by those spirits that stayed
[1:38:11] with
[1:38:12] God are we together now when I'm
[1:38:17] saying when the Bible says the father
[1:38:20] has sealed
[1:38:22] him the word of God is
[1:38:26] sealed is
[1:38:29] hidden to
[1:38:31] those that are not
[1:38:37] predestinated for eternal
[1:38:39] life right you'll see as I'm going I
[1:38:43] said there is life after
[1:38:45] death I said the different
[1:38:48] bodies we are in this
[1:38:50] bodies in this dimension
[1:38:54] in a certain
[1:38:55] dispensation we've got different
[1:39:00] dispensations we've got different body
[1:39:02] in each and every
[1:39:06] dispensation are we together so now we
[1:39:09] have different
[1:39:12] promises on each and every
[1:39:16] dispensation whenever there's a
[1:39:19] dispensation by that I mean when
[1:39:21] God moves
[1:39:24] he moves to a certain point and then he
[1:39:28] changes from a certain point and take
[1:39:31] another
[1:39:33] dispensation like what he did with the
[1:39:36] children of Israel they went out of
[1:39:40] Egypt then when they reach the river I
[1:39:43] mean sea they cross
[1:39:47] over so now it's another
[1:39:51] dispensation it's another Ministry
[1:39:54] it's another
[1:39:56] Doctrine when they went out it Moses
[1:40:00] said to them get out out of that place
[1:40:05] out of that place then they went out the
[1:40:09] the doctrine was out of that place move
[1:40:13] out of that
[1:40:15] place so even the angel came and said
[1:40:20] the death
[1:40:21] angel the doctor
[1:40:24] was slaughter a
[1:40:26] lamb smear the blood do whatever this
[1:40:30] Angel
[1:40:31] says he was speaking through Moses that
[1:40:35] was the doctrine of the time but after
[1:40:38] they Cross
[1:40:40] River you cannot say come out they are
[1:40:44] out they are on root now now they need
[1:40:48] to have a Ministry a Doctrine
[1:40:53] that will survive
[1:40:56] them that will take them
[1:40:59] through that is why now he says the son
[1:41:03] of man is is
[1:41:05] hidden because when he
[1:41:08] changes people remain behind they don't
[1:41:11] want to cross the Red
[1:41:14] Sea as they go to the Red Sea the
[1:41:18] ministry was
[1:41:20] Mana right that was the ministry
[1:41:24] until they reach the
[1:41:26] border of the River
[1:41:28] Jordan once they cross the
[1:41:32] river that is the end of the
[1:41:35] ministry of the
[1:41:37] desert so now what I'm saying say now
[1:41:41] there is
[1:41:44] dispensation and those dispensation I've
[1:41:47] got different
[1:41:51] Ministries different
[1:41:54] doctrines the word of God as it moves
[1:41:58] on it changes the
[1:42:02] people they grow in the Bible
[1:42:06] [Music]
[1:42:07] says it speaks about there a
[1:42:12] little here a little you see that's how
[1:42:15] you
[1:42:16] grow there a little there but you grow
[1:42:21] until you reach a certain stage
[1:42:24] there are those that will not
[1:42:27] die but they will
[1:42:30] change there are those that has
[1:42:34] departed they are not
[1:42:38] dead no where they are now they are
[1:42:43] waiting for the day of
[1:42:47] [Music]
[1:42:49] Resurrection there and the resurrection
[1:42:53] there are
[1:42:54] those that resurrect now as I'm
[1:42:58] speaking they share the word of God and
[1:43:02] the word of God find a place in their
[1:43:05] heart and when they find a place in
[1:43:09] their
[1:43:10] heart then they resurrect they they live
[1:43:14] the death
[1:43:16] life and take a new
[1:43:19] life and when they take a new life they
[1:43:23] will never go for
[1:43:27] judgment are we together amen so
[1:43:32] now I want to say to
[1:43:36] you in verse
[1:43:38] 62 verse 62 it
[1:43:42] says what and if you shall see the son
[1:43:46] of man
[1:43:48] Ascend up where he was before
[1:43:54] now he was here on Earth and then they
[1:43:57] say he will
[1:43:59] Ascend and go to where he was
[1:44:04] before one
[1:44:06] day they were arguing with our Lord
[1:44:09] Jesus
[1:44:11] Christ and then he said unto
[1:44:14] them you don't know where I come
[1:44:19] from you see now you cannot know where
[1:44:23] he comes
[1:44:24] from unless you know where you come
[1:44:29] from you see it the first thing is that
[1:44:33] you should if he says he'll Ascend and
[1:44:35] go back where he was
[1:44:38] before where he was before it means
[1:44:42] then
[1:44:45] if you are a child of
[1:44:48] God you are an offspring of God
[1:44:54] you come from
[1:44:57] him right and when you come from God you
[1:45:01] go back to
[1:45:08] God who's coming from God is returning
[1:45:12] back to God if you if you come from
[1:45:15] God then you'll go back to and if you
[1:45:19] come from
[1:45:21] God worshiping God
[1:45:24] will be your
[1:45:28] priority worshiping
[1:45:30] God it won't be a pden to
[1:45:33] you worshiping
[1:45:36] God it will be a a life to
[1:45:40] you now when we say
[1:45:43] now today we have met our brother is
[1:45:47] departed we it's it's his memorial
[1:45:51] service
[1:45:53] now his memorial
[1:45:55] service is that he was a
[1:45:58] worshiper worshiping God now that he has
[1:46:02] departed he's going back to where he was
[1:46:07] before see now if he he went back where
[1:46:10] he was
[1:46:12] before then we we wouldn't cry neither
[1:46:15] would we
[1:46:16] Grumble now that would be in a bad
[1:46:19] mood we will say we will say
[1:46:24] he has
[1:46:26] departed going back where he
[1:46:30] was uh
[1:46:33] Mary and
[1:46:36] Joseph were
[1:46:39] Witnesses Mary met an
[1:46:42] angel the angel said you will
[1:46:46] conceive and bear a child
[1:46:50] son and Joseph was visited by an
[1:46:54] Angel said
[1:46:56] now give that
[1:46:59] son the name of
[1:47:02] Jesus you see they
[1:47:06] they they were Witnesses
[1:47:09] today but as time goes
[1:47:12] on they made him their
[1:47:18] child
[1:47:19] look we have our parents
[1:47:23] we are born by our mothers and
[1:47:27] sisters and they made us their
[1:47:31] children
[1:47:32] actually their are
[1:47:36] children is this
[1:47:39] body they don't know where the spirit
[1:47:41] comes from they don't even know where
[1:47:44] the soul come
[1:47:46] from your father your mother knows only
[1:47:51] the body
[1:47:53] [Applause]
[1:47:54] so that that that that is your natural
[1:47:59] birth but then you need to
[1:48:03] have as the Bible says in the book of
[1:48:07] First Peter can we go into
[1:48:11] that or second Peter I mean to
[1:48:15] say second Peter chapter 1 second Peter
[1:48:18] chapter
[1:48:19] 1 uh if you read
[1:48:23] verse three read verse three my
[1:48:25] brother just listen why am I reading
[1:48:31] this I want to show you
[1:48:35] that my
[1:48:38] body from my mother and
[1:48:41] father but there's something that my
[1:48:44] mother and
[1:48:46] father does not deserve in
[1:48:51] me right amen Listen Now read verse
[1:48:55] four whereby are given unto us exceeding
[1:48:59] great and precious promises that by this
[1:49:02] ye might be partakers of the divine
[1:49:05] nature having escaped the corruption
[1:49:08] that is in the world through now the
[1:49:11] Bible
[1:49:12] say it is given unto
[1:49:16] us exceeding great and precious promises
[1:49:24] it says great and precious
[1:49:30] promises there are
[1:49:33] promises that are
[1:49:35] precious and that are great are given to
[1:49:41] us what are
[1:49:44] those because it says that by
[1:49:47] these
[1:49:51] precious by the these great and precious
[1:49:57] promises you might be partakers of the
[1:50:00] divine
[1:50:04] nature divine
[1:50:07] nature you had
[1:50:13] your you have your P
[1:50:17] nature that is not divine
[1:50:23] I have de nature that is not
[1:50:27] divine right but the Bible speaks about
[1:50:33] great it speaks about great and
[1:50:40] precious great and precious
[1:50:45] promises now with those great and
[1:50:48] precious
[1:50:49] promises then you are able to receive
[1:50:53] your divine
[1:50:58] nature now when you speak about divine
[1:51:02] nature you are speaking about the nature
[1:51:06] that will never
[1:51:07] die you're speaking about the character
[1:51:10] that will never
[1:51:12] die it's
[1:51:14] divine that one then that is your real
[1:51:20] birth the other one
[1:51:23] you you you are just born to be here on
[1:51:27] Earth and take the nature of this
[1:51:31] world or the nature of this
[1:51:34] Earth but the Bible
[1:51:36] says Heaven and Earth shall pass
[1:51:41] away are we together so now that is why
[1:51:46] we read a
[1:51:47] scripture that speaks about the
[1:51:51] quickening it says it is the spirit that
[1:51:54] that
[1:51:57] Quicken and he said
[1:52:00] flesh this flesh profited
[1:52:07] nothing flesh profited
[1:52:12] nothing then it continues and
[1:52:15] say the
[1:52:17] words that I speak unto
[1:52:21] you that's what he says the words that I
[1:52:24] speak unto
[1:52:26] you they are
[1:52:28] spirit and they are
[1:52:31] life so the only
[1:52:34] life that will keep
[1:52:36] you
[1:52:40] eternally is the word that he speak to
[1:52:45] us and where are those words they are
[1:52:49] written
[1:52:50] here the words
[1:52:53] that you
[1:52:54] speak they are
[1:52:58] spirit and they are
[1:53:01] life now those words if they are alive
[1:53:05] then they build life in
[1:53:08] you and they build another body in
[1:53:13] you and they build another nature in
[1:53:18] you and they change your
[1:53:20] character and they change your
[1:53:24] personality the
[1:53:27] words right they said
[1:53:30] here in verse chapter 6 chapter
[1:53:35] 6 in verse 28 verse 28 just
[1:53:40] listen then said they unto
[1:53:45] him what shall we
[1:53:47] do that we might work the works of God
[1:53:55] these people are very
[1:53:57] serious they want to work the work of
[1:54:02] God because they saw that this
[1:54:06] man is is bringing in good
[1:54:10] words he's building us he's assuring
[1:54:15] us now they said to
[1:54:19] him we want to work for God
[1:54:24] want to do the work of God what should
[1:54:27] we do listen to what he
[1:54:30] says Jesus
[1:54:33] answered and said unto
[1:54:37] them uh this is the work of
[1:54:42] God that he believe on
[1:54:48] him
[1:54:50] see I was I was telling you about
[1:54:54] different
[1:54:56] dispensations that as as
[1:54:59] the
[1:55:01] changing we go to different
[1:55:05] dispensation God give different
[1:55:09] promises and God raises different
[1:55:13] people like for instance he came
[1:55:16] himself they were
[1:55:18] expecting a
[1:55:20] messiah they were
[1:55:22] expecting a very huge
[1:55:26] person powerful person the
[1:55:29] Messiah and then they know
[1:55:34] him all the powerful words that he
[1:55:39] speaks instead of taking those
[1:55:42] words they think who is this
[1:55:45] man they they followed him they find
[1:55:49] that no he's the son of Jose
[1:55:53] and his mother is
[1:55:54] Mary they said no this man we
[1:55:57] know his father we know his mother we
[1:56:01] know his sisters and
[1:56:04] brothers now failing to
[1:56:08] see that now it's another
[1:56:13] dispensation they look at the
[1:56:15] person instead of the
[1:56:19] we the life that is there
[1:56:22] right amen that's that's how they missed
[1:56:25] him how did they miss
[1:56:30] John John was in another another
[1:56:34] dispensation his
[1:56:36] dispensation was to point out the
[1:56:40] Messiah to show the
[1:56:42] wealth of the
[1:56:44] Messiah that they are waiting even
[1:56:49] today we are saying
[1:56:52] the Lord is coming all of us will say
[1:56:57] the
[1:56:58] Lord but they should be a man that will
[1:57:02] point to
[1:57:03] that and say there's the lamp of
[1:57:06] God John
[1:57:08] came and pointed him and said this is
[1:57:12] the L of
[1:57:14] God they look at him they look at John
[1:57:18] they look at the Pharisees they look at
[1:57:21] the Sadducees they look at the scribes
[1:57:24] no it can't
[1:57:26] be now now now even
[1:57:30] today the only
[1:57:32] way that you should know about the
[1:57:35] coming of the
[1:57:37] Lord somebody must Point
[1:57:42] him somebody must Point him and say
[1:57:44] there he
[1:57:45] is apart from that you will
[1:57:50] follow your ways
[1:57:53] are we together now what does it say
[1:57:56] here Jesus answered and said unto them
[1:58:00] this is the work of
[1:58:02] God that you believe on
[1:58:06] him whom he had sent he was referring to
[1:58:12] himself believe in
[1:58:14] me because I am the
[1:58:17] S I'm about to
[1:58:19] finish so I'm trying to
[1:58:25] discourage I'm trying to
[1:58:28] discourage those who think
[1:58:31] that uh this world is their
[1:58:35] home I want to discourage
[1:58:38] you if you think this world is your
[1:58:42] home and I want to encourage
[1:58:45] you that there's life
[1:58:48] eternal there's New
[1:58:50] Jerusalem there
[1:58:53] there that's what we are getting to if
[1:58:56] you say this world is your
[1:58:58] home you are missing a
[1:59:03] point right amen let me read another
[1:59:07] scripture in Revelation
[1:59:10] 3 I'm I'm about to
[1:59:15] close Revelation chapter
[1:59:18] 3 just listen to uh verse
[1:59:22] 2
[1:59:24] 21
[1:59:26] 21 can you read it for us my prayer to
[1:59:29] him that overcometh will I grant to sit
[1:59:32] with me in my throne even as I also
[1:59:36] overcame and am sat down with my father
[1:59:39] in his throne now here is speaking about
[1:59:42] his
[1:59:43] throne the Throne of
[1:59:46] God was in
[1:59:49] heaven and then it came down
[1:59:53] to a
[1:59:54] man which is our is
[1:59:57] Jesus now
[1:59:59] today the Throne of
[2:00:02] God is in the heart of
[2:00:05] men right now he
[2:00:08] says to him that
[2:00:12] overcometh now it's speaking about
[2:00:16] overcoming you
[2:00:18] can't
[2:00:20] receive unless you have
[2:00:23] fought and
[2:00:25] overcome when when
[2:00:28] Abraham met uh the King of New
[2:00:35] Jerusalem it was after a
[2:00:38] battle he fought a battle and he won a
[2:00:41] battle and after winning a battle then
[2:00:44] he met the prince of the New
[2:00:48] Jerusalem after fighting
[2:00:52] now I said when we started here said we
[2:00:55] are here for a
[2:00:59] battle it started in
[2:01:01] heaven it's now here on
[2:01:04] Earth we defeated the devil I will read
[2:01:07] you scripture here before I close that
[2:01:11] the devil and his
[2:01:13] followers and everything that belongs to
[2:01:15] him he going to the lake of
[2:01:20] fire he will never make
[2:01:23] it right so now it you have to
[2:01:29] fight and what is fighting it's not a
[2:01:31] physical
[2:01:33] War it's a it's a it's a it's a
[2:01:37] supernatural it's a spiritual
[2:01:39] one it's a Divine
[2:01:42] one but he
[2:01:45] said the Bible says without faith you
[2:01:49] cannot please God
[2:01:52] right
[2:01:54] amen faith in
[2:01:56] what faith in what you cannot see with
[2:01:59] your
[2:02:00] nak we're talking about the new
[2:02:03] places we're talking about New Jerusalem
[2:02:07] we're talking about life
[2:02:10] after but those things we are talking
[2:02:12] about
[2:02:13] God nobody has
[2:02:16] ever
[2:02:19] met the morning or or in the street
[2:02:24] there right but we have
[2:02:27] faith that God is there we see the
[2:02:31] things we hear the word we believe the
[2:02:35] word that is preaching we read this word
[2:02:38] and then it builds
[2:02:40] us and when the time come that our body
[2:02:46] our spirit and our soul
[2:02:50] separate we not going to shout and
[2:02:54] cry no we go in
[2:02:57] peace because we know where we are
[2:03:02] going so that here he says to him that
[2:03:07] overcometh I will grant to sit in my
[2:03:11] Throne remember that his
[2:03:14] throne in you is in your
[2:03:18] heart that's where your soul is
[2:03:22] so he says now he will grant to
[2:03:25] SE with him in his
[2:03:29] throne that is in your heart that's
[2:03:32] where your soul
[2:03:34] is that's where the real
[2:03:38] you are we
[2:03:41] together
[2:03:43] even as I also
[2:03:47] overcame and I'm sat down with my father
[2:03:50] in
[2:03:53] in
[2:03:54] closing
[2:03:56] this
[2:03:58] this scripture that I've written here I
[2:04:01] mean that I've just read that says I've
[2:04:05] sat down with my father in his
[2:04:09] throne now if you're speaking about the
[2:04:12] father and the son to most people you're
[2:04:15] talking about two
[2:04:18] people talking about two
[2:04:20] people but here he's not speaking about
[2:04:24] two
[2:04:25] people no I'm closing this Bible so that
[2:04:28] you should see that God
[2:04:31] Amen has got no
[2:04:35] beginning it's got no
[2:04:38] ending right
[2:04:40] amen when
[2:04:42] God uh want to process
[2:04:47] himself he has to be a spirit
[2:04:51] why should God be a
[2:04:53] spirit and God has to be the
[2:04:56] we because why because the Bible says
[2:05:00] God God is a
[2:05:02] spirit those that worship Him shall
[2:05:05] worship Him in spirit
[2:05:09] and why should you be the spirit and God
[2:05:12] is not two
[2:05:14] things God himself is a spirit with with
[2:05:18] a capital
[2:05:20] s and God is the
[2:05:23] we in the beginning was the we the we
[2:05:26] was with God the we is
[2:05:31] God right is it the third person spoke
[2:05:35] about the God
[2:05:37] himself
[2:05:38] Elohim who is no beginning or end I
[2:05:42] spoke about the spirit is that the
[2:05:44] second person and I spoke about the
[2:05:47] weight is it is is is the third person
[2:05:51] God if read Exodus
[2:05:53] 3 Moses saw a burning
[2:05:57] bush the Bible
[2:05:59] says God
[2:06:02] speak in that Pillar of Fire which means
[2:06:06] he's a pillar of
[2:06:07] fire god his logos is
[2:06:10] a is he a fourth
[2:06:13] four right now when God is processing
[2:06:17] himself he's processing himself
[2:06:20] according to different
[2:06:23] he become a spirit because when the word
[2:06:27] spoken the word is him the spirit is him
[2:06:34] the Bible says God Ephesians chter 1
[2:06:39] verse 17 says God gave you a
[2:06:44] spirit of
[2:06:46] knowledge and understanding this book is
[2:06:49] sealed
[2:06:51] you cannot read it as a a university
[2:06:55] book it needs his
[2:06:59] Spirit then the the spirit is the one
[2:07:01] that will guide
[2:07:03] you but it must go to a point
[2:07:08] where God
[2:07:10] himself come and indwell
[2:07:13] you where you become a minor God not his
[2:07:19] Spirit not his spirit
[2:07:22] God himself that's what the Bible says
[2:07:25] when Jesus said I and my father are one
[2:07:30] they took
[2:07:31] Stones you read it John 10:30 John
[2:07:36] 10:30 then they say he said to them
[2:07:39] before you throw a
[2:07:42] stone tell me of all the things that
[2:07:45] have
[2:07:46] done which one do
[2:07:50] you this said for doing great
[2:07:54] things raising the Dead Walking upon the
[2:07:59] sea multiplying the
[2:08:01] bre we don't
[2:08:04] do but your
[2:08:06] sin that you are a man you make
[2:08:12] yourself then he said to them read in
[2:08:16] your Scriptures it says
[2:08:21] when the word of
[2:08:23] God is in
[2:08:25] you you are
[2:08:28] God are a
[2:08:31] minor so now those are the
[2:08:34] words that I wanted to say before we
[2:08:37] close that I discourage
[2:08:41] you I discourage
[2:08:44] you
[2:08:45] if you are relying on what is happening
[2:08:50] here
[2:08:52] yes it's good wake up and go to work and
[2:08:55] do whatever you're supposed to do but
[2:08:57] don't ever think that life here is
[2:09:02] eternal this world is going to be
[2:09:05] destroyed the time and signs are
