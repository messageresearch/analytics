sister I'm going to ask the brothers to play that testimony may the Lord richly bless you F Shalom so we have a brief testimony to share last week Tuesday I took Ona to C she was healthy she was fine no health issues at all around 3 in the afternoon I got a call from CR to say I should come fetch her because her temperature is quite high so I red to crash and fetched her and when we got home I gave her like a look warm bath so her temperature can lower a bit she seemed to be a bit fine although her temperature was not normal she went out deide to play and after a while she actually came back into the house and she looked like her enage was very depleted and then I picked her up I continued sponging her body like I continued giving her a look warm um Sponge over her body and then when I looked down on her she had stopped blinking so her eyes were literally just wide open and although she was not looking in my direction it looked like her eyes were fixated on something but I I could not see that thing so I stood up and started calling her name she was not responsive as I'm holding her um her breathing just started to be very shallow she was hardly breathing her color had started changing she was turning blue then I started praying as I'm praying I just remembered to um call the pastor so I called the pastor I called BR asked him to give the pastor the phone as he was trying to get the phone to the pastor I continued praying on my end until finally the pastor got to the phone and when he got to the phone I relate the situation to him and then he started calling on On's name from the get-go the first time he called her he was like on and it was like life rushed back into her body because she literally set up cuz she was in my hands all along she was not moving her color had changed she was literally not breathing she looked like she was gone basically and when the pastor called her called her um she was fine and then and the Pastor said move the the phone closer to her ear which is what I did and then he was like okay just give her water and talk to her she's okay and then my brother-in-law walked in cuz my husband was not around um my husband walked in um and he just took over gave her water I spoke to her and she was fine after that she took um a nap and when she woke up she was 100% fine she's not sick till this day she's fine so we want to thank the Lord for what he did for our family and um just the power that is in this ministry that we should always remember that God has given our pastor and authority and even though he's not here physically um his theophan is always active um so thank you God bless you amen amen I'm going to summarize it the sister was called at CR sister was called to say the child is not well the temperature was high so she took the child back home and tried to attempt to assist the child but later on the child was not well she seems to pass away not responding and the color of the child changed and the sister called the pastor Pastor Israel trust you know Pastor Israel so the pastor called the child through the phone the pastor asked the sister to put the phone close to the child and the pastor

uh we just standing in the Gap in the moment until he comes and take his Pulpit amen amen I would like us to read in the book of Galatians chapter 3 verse 15 and 16 verse 15 16 Galatians chapter 3 from verse 15 Brethren I speak after the manner of me though it be but a man's Covenant yet if it be confirmed no man dis anth or add th to now to Abraham and his seat where the promises made he saith not and to seats as of many but as of one and to thy seat which is Christ amen okay let's bow our heads and and pray gracious Lord this morning again we have gathered here with a purpose and the purpose is to hear from thee Lord Almighty and there's nothing that we can do if thou does not come down and visit us Lord we are here Lord with our our hearts open am knowing that it's your place father we surrender Lord Almighty ourselves unto thee we just read two verses and we believe father with all our hearts that you will always engage ourself yourself as you always visited us you visited our spiritual forefathers yes and you've been visiting us all this time you are the one Lord Almighty amen that knew us and you called us and you did everything Lord until we were Sanctified and tonight I mean this morning Father we are definitely sure that you will always be with us Lord we commit every everything unto thee knowing that father you have given us a promise of the revelation of the seventh seal yes sir and with that promise Heavenly Father we have the power which is the power of the third pool and we believe also in the changing of our bodies amen and we know also Lord Almighty who we are thank you Father yes in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ Lord may you engage us once again thank you Lord amen and amen hallelujah amen okay you may be seated God bless you I have a title here the title will be the attribute sons of his Spirit the attributes yeah the attribute sons of his Spirit yeah but what I really want to uh uh uh speak about the Lord willing is that now there is a testing a testing before the promise Gates now before you enter into the promised land there will be a test like now uh the W is in the bride and that makes her a minor God now if you are a minor God then you will know that will reflect from what you are that will reflect uh from the promise itself in the promise there is a power and there is a potentiality because once God gives you a promise then you live by that promise but that does not mean that the devil will will will sit down and look and say it's done it's done and even God himself will test you to see if you uh you'll be able amen amen all right the the verse 15 says Brethren I speak after the manner of men that is Paul when he says he he speaks uh after the manner of men he means that there's some things that is going to mention which are not usual or the unknown kind are we together so he says I speak after the manner of men which means th I speak and I will mention and unusual things things that you are not used to he continues and says though it be but a men's Covenant yet if it be confirmed no man dis that he says now what I'm going to say I would say it in the manner of men I will say it in an unusual way but once it is confirmed nobody should break it even if I speak things that are not usual to you in a manner of man but if those things have a confirmation you should not break them and you should not add upon those things don't break them upon them if they are amen then verse 16 it says amen now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made amen he said not and to seed as many okay we we we'll explain it what it says here now to Abraham and his seed Not seeds one one seed now to Abraham and his seed were the promises made to his seed only but he he he he reminds us to see that it's not seeds it's seed and thy seed which is Christ so in other words the promise is in the seed Not seeds Abraham had Sons had a son but there is a natural seat there's a spiritual seat now he says there's a seed which is Christ remember we are talking about the attribute of his Spirit God is a spirit and then being a spirit he had attributes and those attributes are called his sons so they attribute of his Spirit the sons of God when he says let us make man in our image after our likeness he was processing his son right amen that that that is his attribute he process what is in his mind don't forget that when we speak about the bride we are speaking about his attribute right amen and don't forget when you speak about the Seed of Abraham he's speaking about Christ and don't forget also when when the prophet says the word is in the [Music] bride the word is the Son of God there is a physical Son of God Jesus there is a supernatural sign Son of God which which is the word that's why the Bible says in the beginning so God has got no beginning there's no point where we say God begins here now that was the beginning of his [Music] process in the beginning was the word that is himself the word was with God the word is the Son of God that's why it says the word was with God it's not the second person no it's God himself he became the weight he became logos the pillar of fire when he became logos the the pillar of fire is not the second person is the same God who's processing himself don't forget that the bride is processed from God the bride is the word of God are we together so when he comes to fetch his bride he's going is com to fetch what he has processed are we together so when we talking about the quickening [Music] power it's when you have the revelation of who you are where do you come from when you see your position in an in in eternity then what will Quicken you is the is the very same word remember we are just a body but the word is what is what is the important part of your life the the the the quickening is when the word takes its position that will bring about the change in your body Jesus was in a Tom tomb and the angel came and open up the tomb there was no body there the body was quickened the body was changed doesn't mean that you get out of the body your body quickened it its form it goes back to what it was before are we right now now you are the attribute when the Bible says in the when the Bible says uh God is a spirit it counts you in God is a spirit it counts you in how would you get right now our story here is just before you enter right at the end of the [Music] route you have to show your true color you are not going to walk [Music] in you f your way in you are a soldier I'll read what brother I used to say you need to know where you come from and know where you are and where you are going but today I'm saying brother Bram says keep going towards the end you keep going towards the end uh when Mary and Joseph went to Bethlehem you still remember to participate in the census that was ordered by Caesar Cesar Augustus Cesar a they had to go to Bethlehem to be counted uh the promise was to Mary the angel came to Mary and God came to Joseph so they had promised but now when now that promise need to be fulfilled Mary had labor pains to walk a distance you see God gave them a promise but towards the manifestation of the promise then there's a challenge see now right now we are waiting for the quickening and God needs to prove that you are are worthy for those people when things are pushing towards the end some loses the direction because they are not part of that right amen so now if the promise was not given to Joseph and Mary they wouldn't push on but they pushed even if there was no place there they pushed in it was fulfilled they are worthy for they worthy for that okay to back up my point let's let's go to uh the book of uh job you'll hear what job job job yes uh chapter 23 job 23 now towards the end that's why the prophet says keep going towards the end there'll be a lot of challenges but keep going on because the if there's somebody that can't go on that is not his promise but your promise is your promise you keep going on regardless of what is happening you move on because that's your life right job job chapter 23 job 23 let's let's read uh verse 10 to 14 verse 10 14 look uh what God did to the devil he said what do you think about my seven job he's the holy man holy holy holy you won't shift him from the way now the promise was that now job will never shift from the regardless of what is going now listen what he says but he knoweth the way that I Take God knoweth the way that you take see amen you've taken the way because God knoweth the way and then he says when he had tried me I shall come forth as the go because he knowe it the way he's the one that called me I won't give up I won't be dismayed regardless of who says what I will continue I'm I'm talking about the bride now the bride will will never be dismayed because she is the word of God she is the attribute of you cannot change what you are if I am and then I try to make myself P it won't happen I will be is bright is the bright the word of God she can't change that's why that he knoweth the way that you'll take because he will try and you'll come forth as good uh verse 11 ver 11 my food had held his steps you heard what he say his way have I kept and not decline Nei have I gone back from the Commandment yeah never have I got back from the Commandment of his lips when he commands what comes out of his man he says when my word comes out in Isaiah 55: 11 when my word come out of my mouth it won't return vo when when he says bright the word bride comes out of his mouth it produces surprise there's no other way that's why he says my food had his steps held his step right amen so in in other words is him working my steps are his steps his way is my way when I say I've kept my way because his way are my ways there's no way that I can right amen so verse 13 says but he is in one mind God is Not double-minded if God is Not double-minded his pride will never be double because that's his attribute what comes out of him it's one mind right amen he's of one mind and whom can I mean who can turn him you wouldn't change God neither would you change the bride it Remains the word of God how good amen and what his soul desire even he doth God do what his soul desire and when his soul desire it's you that desire that your desire it's God desire if God can't fail you w fa because if you can Fai then will be God failing and therefore you won't fail because your father was not a failure amen right amen so that is why now he says the last verse verse 14 for he performed the thing that is appointed for me what I'm doing is what is appointed for [Music] me right amen so what you are doing is what is appointed for you and now you are appointed to be a weight and abide by the we of God now if you failed you were not appointed to it's you that fail is not because many such things are with him everything that comes out of him is Victory and everything that comes to his uh children or his attribute are himself what comes out of God it's God himself what comes out of his attributes it's God himself nothing bad will come out of you what you answer what you UT is what he UTS and what he utter what you uh the prophet Give an example here about a a boy I think there was a competition that they will ride a bike on a plank it's a it's a competition so is this boy was was a cc his friend didn't take him that much sorry his friend didn't worry so much about right and they knew that you know he won't make it because they could see and then the competition went on they all went in one by one one by one they all failed then the the young man was the last he went through now they were surprised then they said to him how did you make it we we we know these things and then he said now fellows I tell you what to do or the boy said that he rode on to the end of the plank and the other boys got rounded and said how did you do it he said now fellows I'll tell you what to do when they started you off they give them a little push so that they could get started hold them up until they start and then they leave them you were looking down to this trying to keep your bicycle in board right uh but I never noticed down here you did that that made you nervous because you looking now right that make you nervous you think that you'll fall off I just put my eyes on the end and kept going to the end towards the end I didn't look around what's going on I just look the end we have a promise that's where our spiritual eye is we are looking at our PR we don't worry about what is going because we are the word of pro he said I look on and kept going towards the [Music] end so you looked around and you got no never I look towards the end that's how I have made it right now I said to you I'm reading a quote here possessing the enemy's gate it's paragraph n amen I will always say don't ever forget the title so that when what we're talking about should be in line it's the attribute of his Spirit and the text the text is is testing before promise promise gates are we together now in this uh book possessing the enem gates he says God had been testing the patriarch [Music] the Patriarchs Israel the ERS because he had given him a promise so the Patrick in this case is [Music] Abraham God has been testing Abraham because he had given him a promise [Music] then he continues and when God makes a promise he wants to be sure that this person is worthy for the promise before he fulfills what he said or what promises the promise is that they will be bright the bride of Christ now God want to see is this could be my bright it's a promise this is my bride now before the Rapture before the the going that is the Gage right amen right the promise gate God wanted to know that this pride is my pride that's what you say so Abraham had been promised that through his [Music] seed the whole world will be blessed that he will have a son the promise was to Abraham through you the whole world going to give birth to a son of which now he will bless your seed your seed that comes from do will bless the whole world right that he will have a son and his son out of him should come forth a [Music] seed right amen and his son out of him that son should come forth a seed that will bless their whole world and Abraham when the promise was given to him he was 75 years old and Sarah his wife was 65 years but the the Bible tells us that Abraham staggered not to the promise of God he never Stagg at the promise of God through unbelief but he was strong giving praise to God never stagered rig rigid and anchor because he is the carrier of the [Music] promise and his son should be the carrier of and on and on and on now in this case remember the Seed of Abraham is Christ that will bless the whole world and what comes out of of of Christ keep on being a blessing because the father is a blessing and the son will be a blessing if the word is the blessing and that word is in the bride then the bright will be blessing to the whole [Applause] world the pastor was saying you know what holds the wall that it should not continue is the seed which is the bride because the devil doesn't know what to do with you the somebody called me and asked me do you you know the demon you call that Demon's name I didn't write it down write said that one they don't want to use it because you people will kill the demon and that will weaken the devil so at the moment he uses he's just using am demons oh together but waiting for you then only release that Dem so there are so many tough and cruel and heartless demons that have been SP they can't execute what they want to execute because there is a bride and that bride is the we and that bride is Christ himself and that bride there's nothing that the devil can do with the only thing you should wait until we go right amen so he says the promise was given to him at the age of 75 he never so St not that the promise of God and he never sted through unbelief but he was strong giving praise to God and God Time After Time tested him but he had come to that final test before the blessing was going to happen before the blessing could happen that was the final because Adam lost the title now God want to give the title de to the bride he must make sure that he is a real bride right that is why we are the Seed of Abraham in faith right amen now he says the great hour of charge is at hand charges to attack the great hour of church is at hand the prophet says it's an hour now that you should attack you should attack is the great hour is 10 not physical attack your attack I I'll tell you before I close this book yeah it's still the same book The Greatest B ever fought in in paragraph 149 the great hour of charge is at hand soldier with armo gaming colors streaming faith and doubt is setting yourself in Array now when you say you set in Array which means you are ready now to fight you have faith that now you now it's Faith against [Music] amen right amen faith and doubt is setting yourself in array in this Tabernacle this morning doubt on one side faith on the other soldiers stand at your post of Duty he says you are soldiers stand at the post of Duty our captain the Morning Star keeps on leading us keeps on he never go back he never don't know the word Retreat our doesn't know the word Retreat he's moving on he's moving on right at the Gate of the promise he's moving on he don't have a retreat now and paragraph 655 on this book who is this MC remember we no before we go that in the book of of Chronicles uh 20 verse 15 ver 15 if if if you if you can my brother can you read it for Chronicles 20 verse 15 and he said Heen ye all Judah and ye inhabitance of Jerusalem and Thou King Jehoshaphat thus said the Lord unto you be Not Afraid nor dismayed by reason of this great multitude for the battle is not your but Gods amen now here God was telling King Jehoshaphat he said be not afraid I mean be not uh afraid not dismayed by reason of this great multitude for the battle is not yours are we together amen it's not yours now the word that is in you it's more than enough to the battle is not a caral one the battle is of the Lord and if the word is in you that word will do the fight when Joshua cross over he met the captain of the host that shows that now from there on the battle was not Joshua's so he has crossed over to the pro amen now let's read it uh Joshua chapter 5 Joshua 5 let's read only two verses vers 14 and 15 so the attri the attributes which uh comes from God they are always in Array and the the battle we talking about it's not a physical B no it's a supernal now if you don't know the devil he can mess you up in 3 minutes 3 minutes mess you up you can destroy the church are we together he tried that with our Lord but the word that was in him defeated him because he say it is written that was more than enough I said we should read Joshua chapter 5 Joshua 5 vers 14 vers 14 and 15 14 and 15 and he said nay but as captain of the host of the Lord am I now come and Joshua fell on his face to the Earth and did worship and said unto him what saith my Lord unto his servant amen and the cap of the Lord's host said unto Joshua lose thy shoes from off thy foot for the place where on thou sendeth is Holy and Joshua did so amen right you see now when he cross over he meet the captain of the host when brother Bram went Westward coming back he had a different Ministry a different Ministry [Music] that was the ministry of an Angel and since then the ministry is of the [Music] Angels amen good let's read the the last one uh on that side Joshua chter 1 verse 5 Joshua 1 verse5 so the attributes of of of of God uh which which which are the sons of his Spirit they are really powerful if they know who they are with the right anointing you got it in verse 5 it's vers 6 5 josua 1 verse 5 there shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life you see amen all the days of th life he said josua no man will stand before you all the days of thy life that is why brother Bram says God will raise Joshua to take you through so there's no enemy that can stand before them see that's what brother say he went to that and when they cross over it was Joshua that cross and when we cross over it will be Joshua that any church that does not believe that code it will be difficult for them to CR because they Joshua is's not sure he's not sure because now if you are Joshua you should know that you're Joshua and you let the flock cross over and you lead the flock to the back knowing that now the angel of the Lord is doing the [Applause] fighting we are together before they cross the River Jordan it overflowed right at the cage right at the cage at the promised gate they were promised the promised land when they had to cross the river overflow because during the Harvest that will always will happen so it overflowed Joshua was not dismayed the cap was there whether it's a river whether it's a sea whatever they crossed over look whether there is a big wall standing before you you will make [Applause] it because the word that is in you the one that will be Crossing are we together amen no one should be able to stand against you all the days of life not only for today be not afraid no and be don't be discouraged because of the vast Army of the devil for the battle is not yours it's God's battle so now the hour of church is at uh I was about to read this code who is this m paragraph 65 amen says when Abraham met him he was MC he unfolds here what all the attributes will do in the Final End Amen so he he unfold watch all the attributes remember you are an attribute now it says now he unfold it at the final end now the final end is the gate to The Promise Land now all the Seed of Abraham will do that when Abraham met him he was M he unfolds here what all the attributes will do in the Final End every son of Abraham every son of the faith will absolutely do the same thing right amen [Music] but he says I want to watch how we have to come right 67 same book now we see the attribute sons of his Spirit the attribute sons of his spirit have not yet entered into the word form body at that time it was it was not yet revealed uh but will be unfolded towards the end time now when theam speak about this he was speaking about what will be unfold now this is the time at that time uh he says now we are at the attribute sons of his Spirit see yes have not entered into the word from body this body which is a theop is subject to the word together the changing of the body is when the theop takes over at that time it was not revealed but will be unfolded towards the end time because the Bible say God is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in truth and spirit amen and in Romans 8 in verse 16 it says the spirit itself right amen Beed witnessed with our spirit that we are the children of of God in other the spirit of God within capital S bettered witness with our spirit with a small s that we are the children of God and verse 17 says ver 17 and if if children if we are the children then we are the HS of God right we are the A and join as with Christ if so be that we suffer with him so that we may be glorified together amen that's why he said I and my father are so amen and when he Express then in in he says again what happen the same book then the attribute was first I mean the attribute was first God the thought right the Ed SC the thought that's the attribute itself all in one without being expressed so God was had something within himself that he wanted to express now what he expressed it's the attribute that is why we speaking about the attribute of uh sons of his Spirit the attribute sons of his spirit so that's how it is then when he expressed secondarily he became the we and then the we was made flesh and dwell among right if you go to John 10 10 uh in verse 37 verse 37 he says if I do not the work of my father believe me not 38 but if I do though you believe not me believe the works that you may know and believe that the father is in me and I'm in him you can't teach a person to walk upon the sea no you can't you can teach him to swim but you can't teach him to walk up now the bright is the revealed weight a preacher cannot reveal the weight the preacher preaches the way and you see it there and you grasp it there the preacher of got an anointing and while you sitting down here we are all preachers we preach together we are in in one Harmony and if you are not in that Harmony you will doze because it's not part of your life when the preacher prepares a message he prays until he gets an anointing until you get inspired until you get F and when you come to the you pray until you get an anointing until you get an inspiration you take it by faith that makes you a son that make one Harmony now together so as you are right now you are preaching together with me are we together so now if you not listen what he says verse 38 but if I do though you believe not me believe the works that you may know and believe that the father is in me and I in him now if you you you go back to I'm about to close if you go to the spoken word is the Original Seed in paragraph 806 806 he speaks about uh that we should live in a way that reflects the peace and wellness that God wants for us that that is what we call Harmony Harmony is when you are living in a way that reflects peace if you don't peace we are not in harmony if you reflect peace and wellness that's what God wants from you [Music] you and wellness that is harmony listen to what he says in paragraph 806 notice what Harmony Jesus never did anything until sin of the father now that confuses a lot of people that until he sees the Father the things that he copy from the father oh the father is doing that I'm doing this the word is the father in you that's why Philip said show us the father he said the father is in me and I am in him and so all this time we not aware that it's not me doing that it's the father that is doing now that same father is in you now those same words that Jesus spoke you should be speaking them because it says at that day you shall know if you shall know then those wordss will be your wordss and he is he he moves on and says now the harmony between God and Christ and that's where now he says now he say so will the bride and he shows her his way of life he shows her and she receives it and she never doubts nothing can harm her not even that for if the seed be planted the water will raise it up that's why now he says here is the secret the word in the bride that when we read what amen now this is this book I'm closing this book uh experiences an old book The Prophet preached that book 1948 some of you were not born by I was also one year old when he was preaching about this but this code is still working for us he says your faith is the only thing that can do you any good that's your belief your faith in God without faith it's impossible now you believe it with all your heart know you should believe who you are you are the briide believe that you are the pride you see amen there were no signs in Abraham or or in Sarah but he believe when Moses faed the Red Sea there's no way in which he can cross it he believed when Joshua fa the River Jordan it overflowed but the promise pushed go through now you could see Darkness you could see Darkness but keep on pushing look at the promise the promise will push you you stick to the promise and then it will let move on you look Beyond you go right there your faith is the only thing that can you any now he says well now look sight is a sense sight of the body is that true sight is one of the senses how many senses are there in the body see taste feel smell and hear and how many senses are there to [Music] Spirit in your spirit how many senses do you have he says two faith and doubt your spirit is either Faith or doubt that is the sense of your spirit so faith is the sense of your spirit let me close by this code this comment came from the pastor one day I wrote it down I liked it what he says he said I'm quoting the pastor now whenever Abraham's name is mentioned they Royal Seed of Abraham is also in that [Music] statement When you mention the word Abraham the Royal seat is in that statement right amen God always deals with the prophet and his seed prophet and his right Amen brother Bram brother and Abraham are the two witnesses of [Music] MC when Abraham met mcedc gave off himself and brother Bram said I also met MC look you will never be warmed by a painted fire when you feel cold when you feel cold you don't go to a thrwing of a fire no it won warm you no the smell of good food will never quench your hunger even if we can hear smell of good food when when you are hungry are hungry if they can draw a glass of water when you are thirsty it won't quench you the only thing that will quench you is the revealed word of [Applause] God and at the right the right season the last statement the greatest battle ever fought the greatest battle ever fought she is going on right in here now between life and death between sickness and health between faith and doubt between Li Liberty and bondage he says the battle is on and he continues
