[music] Okay. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; As we were trying to show that &gt;&gt; something here, &gt;&gt; but then let's read something because we I must close the service. There's a quote here. &gt;&gt; Marriage and divorce. &gt;&gt; Marriage and divorce. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We've got to be the children of this age. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; We've got to be the children of this age through the pregnancy of the word of God. Amen. Amen. Uh while we are on here, you know, uh Paul says some something here &gt;&gt; to Timothy. &gt;&gt; I quote h second Timothy chapter one &gt;&gt; verse 8 verse 8 to his son. Be not thou therefore ashamed of the testimony of our Lord, nor of me, his prisoner, but be thou partaker of the afflictions of the gospel according to the power of God. Okay. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now he says the testimony of our Lord of me. &gt;&gt; That is Paul. Now listen again here. H it's a father to a a son. And uh as we will go back to to this uh scriptures here I have this part here to uh where are you just to share with you one one thing again here in the in the in the same book that's Timothy. Yes. Now he says &gt;&gt; um verse 13 verse 13 verse 14 &gt;&gt; hold first the form of sound words which thou has heard of me hold fast the form of sound words sound gospel which thou has heard of me. Amen. &gt;&gt; You see, &gt;&gt; you have heard of me. &gt;&gt; Me. Amen. Now, now he's a father. &gt;&gt; Talking to a son. Amen. &gt;&gt; Uh you have heard of me in faith and love which is in Christ Jesus. that good thing which was committed unto thee, you know, it was committed unto &gt;&gt; Timothy. Amen. As a father, he prayed for Timothy. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he committed things unto Timothy. Amen. Keep unto thee keep by the Holy Spirit &gt;&gt; who dwelleth in us. Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why Paul says they went from us because they were not of us. Because the Holy Spirit dwelleth in us. &gt;&gt; Okay. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, uh that is Paul to his son. And uh h again now I go back to this h e h uh because it says here &gt;&gt; for the time will come that is chapter 4 now second Timothy verse three &gt;&gt; for the time will come when they will not endure a sound doctrine but after they own youthful lusts. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because if you come with a sound gospel to them, you are too old. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. uh you are not saving their lasts. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. So because they've got some goals they want to achieve but they don't want a matured man to teach them because a matured man will take them higher and they don't want that position. They will want to remain as youth. So with their youthful last their mind, they look around the world. They want to be like that one and to be that one. If he's a singer, he wants to sing like that one. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; It's not to sing unto the Lord. Is to sing for fame to be seen of people. Amen. To be praised of men. That is the thing that led Elvis Press out of the church. and Michael Jackson all those they sold their souls for fame. They left their Pentecostal fathers and they became fatherless. Now a child without fatherh can can can sold can sell his soul. He has no responsible father. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So they started in the church all of them singing in the church. Jesus keep me near the cross. Amen. &gt;&gt; And the Bible standing outside, the Satan standing outside say you'll get no fame in the church there. No money. You'll get no money there. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; No one will praise you there. &gt;&gt; The world won't see you. you can't entertain the world. &gt;&gt; So get out. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then Satan &gt;&gt; will equipped &gt;&gt; them with whatever. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hey, what's up? WhatsApp &gt;&gt; Facebook &gt;&gt; instead of talking to the pastor, they are talking through the WhatsApp to the young to the other young. &gt;&gt; They need young pastors. Not only young but educated because they think they know better. Elijah was an old man. [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; He had a son, &gt;&gt; Elisha. &gt;&gt; Elisha. Elisha Elisha knew that &gt;&gt; in this man is not a master of &gt;&gt; he's not masters. &gt;&gt; He hasn't achieved masters. &gt;&gt; But in this man there is God. Amen. You see they followed somebody who with God. Amen. In our age, a brother from Baptist, I'm looking at the clock there. They were talking saying that &gt;&gt; Yeah. Do you see brother the two brothers I I was just listening you know uh uh uh uh this uh she pastor we have these days is better than that one the former one you know this one knows she knows her thing. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; She knows her thing. You know, she's well vested. She she know she she she knows &gt;&gt; the desires of the young people. Not that one. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; An old man who's talking about holiness all the time. Holiness. Amen. Yeah. You should be holy. love one another and they got tired of that. So they want somebody will come and say uh you see with me I won't mind if a young man maybe um after the service he goes for the volleyball and you see a smart preacher &gt;&gt; like that one in where to saying you know I don't believe in God with um with some who will leave his children uh to be poor. Amen. I believe in a rich God and so forth. And the people were clapping, Amen. Amen. Those who with money and education were clapping hands and these others, the poor ones could not clap hands. Then that man he preaches with one hand in the pocket like this saying you see Jesus &gt;&gt; was a rich man and yet Jesus &gt;&gt; could not pay tax. Amen. &gt;&gt; He had no money to pay tax. He had to fish out a fish and fish out tax money out of that fish. [cheering] Amen. &gt;&gt; Jesus with an empty wallet. He was coming w with these people one time and he looked at a fig tree and a fig tree has failed to yield fig. The Bible says he was hungry. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; The son of God was hungry. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now talking about rich Jesus. &gt;&gt; Where did he work? So he was hungry. The Bible say he looked he looked at the fig tree &gt;&gt; and uh without fig. So he cursed that tree because he was the hungry messiah. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; That was his humanity. He came to be a man, &gt;&gt; not a rich man, &gt;&gt; not an educated man, &gt;&gt; but the Messiah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. [cheering and applause] &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Praise God. I was told &gt;&gt; that you know that men &gt;&gt; can put things you know the people read books like Monru &gt;&gt; those who don't believe that if you are a child of God you should be poor But you rather remain &gt;&gt; without money but with God. Amen. [applause] &gt;&gt; Because if you are without money, &gt;&gt; God will take care of you. Amen. Have you seen a person growing up &gt;&gt; like a small children when they they are growing up when they go for the exams they will always say mommy pray for me I'm going to sit for my exams exam &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; amen &gt;&gt; but Then he's great. What? What? Great. What? What? Great. What? What? Great. What? What? He no longer ask for prayers. He's God's friends now. And he has reached uh a place where he thinks that he knows better than mommy. So he can ask for prayers. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So in life it is like that when a child grows in the church. Firstly I thank God for my pastor. Thank God for the pastor. Amen. God has given me a pastor. Then he reaches metric and I thank God for my pastor goes down now. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If he goes beyond now he doesn't take anything from the pastor. know &gt;&gt; he knows then he will befriend his own level where if you find friends in the house with old mama and old papa are uned when they come in the Even the friends of these girls here, they say to go there, "Hi." &gt;&gt; But hi. &gt;&gt; Amen. Then they sit down around the sofa &gt;&gt; with mama in the midst &gt;&gt; thinking maybe the children are around now. Maybe now we can start the conversation with my children. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. One has the headphones &gt;&gt; headphones &gt;&gt; and right around the mama they going to WhatsApp. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Mama will end up going to sleep because no company is the youth they are doing their own thing. Amen. No time for parent. They have outgrown their parents. They know better now. Amen.

You going there, the last the the useful lust, you won't stop, you won't stop them. Even if you come with the Bible and say the Bible say, the Bible say they just going there to their own demise. You get what I mean? Amen. &gt;&gt; Now they end up &gt;&gt; in a teacher. &gt;&gt; Let me close with this. Now &gt;&gt; for the time will come that is a father Paul when they will not endure sound gospel. You'll never hear them talking about the seven seal or the third or what what you know it's always Facebook WhatsApp WhatsApp to another pastor not their pastor theirs is an old pastor so they want young people you shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free shall you free &gt;&gt; [cheering] &gt;&gt; Young man, &gt;&gt; the prophet of God says, &gt;&gt; "The pastor is your Joshua." &gt;&gt; Young men. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Things have started around us &gt;&gt; and hit the wall. &gt;&gt; Can you think how many things things have started started? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And they start with a boom. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. They just plowing towards a rock. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; My friends, &gt;&gt; the prophet says, &gt;&gt; everybody has got the right to worship where he wish. So you can you can do that. You know, I always say to the people, &gt;&gt; you have found me here. worshiping God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Climbing up the leather. &gt;&gt; But the people that are down there, they don't want you to lift them up. They are looking at a mountain and they are going to hit that mountain because it's either you climbed or you hit it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's only two things with a mountain. It's either you climb that mountain or you crash against it. &gt;&gt; The Bible says so. is either you believe Jesus Christ because he is the rock of ages. If you don't believe him, you you crash against the rock. I've seen churches studying around us and the people will will go there thinking that God has now come. The next thing &gt;&gt; it's on the rock &gt;&gt; they go to another one. &gt;&gt; It is like a people sailing. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They see the ship is going down. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now they take they jump onto the lifesaver. The the &gt;&gt; lifeboat. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Life boats. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And start puddling &gt;&gt; to another sinking ship. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Jump into that one. When the ship now is down, they start swimming to another sinking ship. Amen. Amen. Because &gt;&gt; uh they can't even think. &gt;&gt; You see now look what what he says then &gt;&gt; they will not endure sound that gives you life. &gt;&gt; Something that puts Christ in you. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; So in everything you do, &gt;&gt; Christ becomes number one. [applause] [cheering] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Useful lust. &gt;&gt; Listen, &gt;&gt; for the time will come &gt;&gt; when they will not endure sound doctrine. But after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves because that pastor doesn't want girls and boys to run around go to that other one not to serve God &gt;&gt; but to serve the lasts. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I don't want the seventh seal. &gt;&gt; No, this one is too much on the seventh seal. &gt;&gt; Time is running for me. &gt;&gt; I will lose. I must achieve. I must follow my dreams. This is the young people today. Mhm. Follow your dreams. &gt;&gt; Where too? &gt;&gt; The world shall pass away and all its lusts it shall pass away. &gt;&gt; Let me finish this scripture and shall he to themselves teachers having itching ears. you know an itching ear I've seen at a stadium &gt;&gt; I don't know there was something there &gt;&gt; but they asked a gospel group to sing now the people that are there Jay-Z &gt;&gt; these are the Jay-Z people &gt;&gt; and what call them the kinds of music, &gt;&gt; what do you call it? Hip hop. &gt;&gt; Hiphop &gt;&gt; and so forth. &gt;&gt; Yeah, you can see the way they are dressed up that they dressed up for hip-hop, &gt;&gt; not Jehovah. Dressed up for Jay-Z, not Jehovah. &gt;&gt; Dress up for Lady Gaga. So I don't know what happened. A gospel group started to sing about Jesus. &gt;&gt; So they were looking at them like this and they were singing say Jesus is the Lord. &gt;&gt; They were just looking at them &gt;&gt; waiting for Jay-Z. Their ears are itching. Not not to hear about God, but to hear about Lady Gaga Beyonce. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You say, &gt;&gt; "Okay." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Let me show each ear &gt;&gt; not to hear the word of God. &gt;&gt; No. &gt;&gt; And they shall turn away their ears from the truth. Are you listening? &gt;&gt; They shall turn their ears from the &gt;&gt; truth. &gt;&gt; Truth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And shall be turned unto fables. &gt;&gt; Fables. &gt;&gt; Thinking that maybe we should do this. &gt;&gt; A brother came to my house. Let me close this Bible now. A brother came to my house saying, "Brother, when are you going to call for the youth service or what?" I said my brother, &gt;&gt; brother Brennham, &gt;&gt; brother, &gt;&gt; he said one time, &gt;&gt; I used to talk to the young people. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I used to do that. Then you can ask him and then what happened now when the seals were opened. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. which you can't take that to a youth camp &gt;&gt; because they are busy hiking, you know, &gt;&gt; and doing some things, you know, you can't take the the seals to a youth company. [cheering] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's where the people are taught that &gt;&gt; they bring a wise men there showing young people how to love one another. If if they are not taught of God, then they needed a teacher. &gt;&gt; Because when when when I was created &gt;&gt; and you were created, God has put these things in you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When a child is born, &gt;&gt; do you teach him to suck? Do you teach the baby to suck? Immediately after the the baby's born and when she even can't see &gt;&gt; but already she wants milk because this thing is in the child. [cheering] &gt;&gt; You don't take the child to school in order for to suck from the mother's breast. saying you see milk is this it will do this in your body and death. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; No, it's already there. &gt;&gt; Now love you can't teach love. [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; Can you teach the people how to love one another? Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I know you don't agree, &gt;&gt; but that thing if it is from God, &gt;&gt; it doesn't need somebody to teach you how to love because there isn't a gap love and feel your love. They are not from a university. &gt;&gt; They are from God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then you love from the heart, &gt;&gt; not from the head. Amen. [applause] Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. Amen. &gt;&gt; People can waste time. Then they read many things. &gt;&gt; You know, you open the door for her. &gt;&gt; You see the first thing from job you keys and &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Then the people with some notes. Amen. But he's a what speaker? Am I wait what speaker? &gt;&gt; Motivational speaker. &gt;&gt; Motivational speaker. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; Is a man who comes you know saying and now uh as young people we need to achieve. We need to be vested and you know and so he will start those things &gt;&gt; after &gt;&gt; I've seen them after that &gt;&gt; and if divorce comes it comes &gt;&gt; God has taught us all whom the father has taught. That's why Jesus himself &gt;&gt; he always said my father &gt;&gt; my father [applause and cheering] &gt;&gt; because he can trace himself back. Amen. &gt;&gt; I have received of my father and that person can teach the others. because it is from Paul says, did you hear Paul speaking? &gt;&gt; Oh, I don't want to hold you, but there's something here which is very important. Uh, okay. If let let me just quote it to you. Uh, where is it? Brother, brother uh Bruno. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Uh Timothy chapter 1. Second Timothy chapter 1A verse 3. &gt;&gt; I thank God whom I serve from my forefathers. &gt;&gt; You see? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; From Amen. &gt;&gt; Now a fatherless child &gt;&gt; uh has nothing to refer to. So he's just picking on things that are oncoming because uh he can't say my father taught me I have learned from my father I have received from my father no he's fatherless any person can do whatever he wants with him because he can't refer. He He's got no father. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Fatherless child. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He can't think. Somebody must think for him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; A fatherless. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Okay. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Whom I serve from my and the Bible says &gt;&gt; he shall turn &gt;&gt; the hearts of the &gt;&gt; children back to their fathers. Amen. [cheering] &gt;&gt; Brother Brenham says Cain could not trace himself. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. because his father was without the garden of Eden. But Abel could trace himself back because his father was in the garden of Eden. Amen. Now that's why Cain without any instructions, &gt;&gt; no commitments, he had a stick with him &gt;&gt; to hit anybody who would oppose him. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If I'm saying I'm going that way, I'm going that way. No one is going to tell me what to do. No one is going to tell me how to worship. No one is going to tell me where to worship. I know what I'm doing. I have a dream to pursue. That was Cain. Then Adam came with seven seals. Cain hid him. [laughter] He he could not endure sound gospel. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. He just he wanted something tickling to his. He could only move when he could only move when it is according to the lustful the the useful lust. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; But thank God there is some young people Amen.

But you know, a fable, &gt;&gt; a fable is something that sounds good, but has got no life. Amen. It's a fable as if God has done nothing. So they are studying a fresh. that we must do this, come together and do this and do this and do that. As if God has done nothing. And the prophet shouted and said, "It's all over. &gt;&gt; The seals are open. It's all over." Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let him that is filthy be filthy still. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let him that is righteous be righteous still because the book was open. [screaming] The names were called and it's all over.
