Description:
Title: The Rock Confession of Ages Vol 2
Preached by Pastor Israel Nkodima on 09-03-2025 at Mamelodi Tabernacle.

The Pastor read the following scriptures:

John 1: 1 | Genesis 15: 5 | Genesis 8: 2

The purpose of the sermon was to show the audience about the rock confession of all ages.

Eternal life has no beginning because it is eternal. Before you were born there was a strip of blood waiting to take on that body.

The Samaritan women said I know that the messiah cometh. Who told her? it is because she came from the messiah. You cannot serve somebody you have not met. You came from the messiah in order to come and serve the messiah.

You can only serve God whom you come from, because you know Him and how to serve Him.

There is a difference between the word and the promised word. There is a difference between the word and the word that has become God. God's word promised is the blood.

Rapture is for the redeemed, and he has redeemed us before the foundation of the world. Before God brought us down to earth he tested us first. 

The first bible was zodiac and God took it and put it in the pyramid.

The rock of ages spoke to peter the small stone, and the small stone said thou art Christ son of the living God.  And he said upon this stone I will build my church.

The Pastor read the following spoken words:

63-0320 The Third Seal Par 100
60-1206 The Smyrnaean Church Age Par 120
62-1104M Blasphemous Names Par 72 & 71
64-0705 The Masterpiece Par 198
57-0818 Time Tested Memorials of God Par 106
63-0324E The Seventh Seal Par 393 & 404

and you also here God bless [Applause] [Music] [Music] you asking me seriously looking at me in the morning right into the eyes asking me did you really sleep I said no I don't I don't sleep okay amen it is by the grace of God Amen that we have gaed here [Music] and re busy going some places looking for a suitable pyramid we are looking for something amen because the prophet of God says the bride of Christ is like a pyamid amen amen amen so um we that's why always when we we meet you know the first thing I was looking at was that the prophet of God speaks of as being the blood amen amen amen and I look at it properly and I said yes God's Prophet we are the blood amen amen yes not just the blood but the blood of the Son of God that's why you cannot sin because you are amen amen God is worshiped by the blood that's why we the Gentiles before we could come in he had to die [Music] first in order that he should receive us as his blood amen you know of your your blood amen amen uh if perhaps some you are working and you come to where you find or the people come to where they find and then they find some spot where there is black in in the on the road they will stop and say whose blood is this it's not like water someone has spilled water but the blood blood can this be that's why while walking looking we found that and I was reading something yesterday uh if I don't find it yet I will find it for you so we are the blood of God this morning uh I don't have many to say but I don't know about [Music] him yeah yeah yeah God's word promised became blood now if you are a promise child of God amen amen when uh when he died those drops of [Music] blood something that that were saying something amen and you came after he has shed that blood but before that we were in him uh coming from that Fountain of Life if you understand now we are going to read the word of of god let's bow our heads let me not try to pray pray for us there is none like the you've gathered us here again to speak unto us you've chosen our pastor to be the one feeding us this morning Lord we commit him unto you may you be the one that speaks through him oh God we have seen you we have heard you speaking through him for many years you have never failed you remain the same oh God once more this morning come and speak unto us oh the singer says Bread of Heaven feed me till I want no more amen amen amen um in the beginning was the word do you know that scripture brother in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the word is God Amen John chapter 1 from verse one in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God amen amen amen and the word is amen you may be seated God bless you now if we have to look at the blood test amen you know we come here to the service each and every one of us being that blood that was shed for you and me amen amen that's why in the book SM SM in church AG it speaks of page 2111 it speaks of the blood test right amen whether you are God's or not you are God you you are God God's children and you are God children God's children and you have eternal life amen now eternal life has no beginning because that is eternal without a beginning you say brother I was born amen amen I began there but I'm we are talking about eternal life where do you find the beginning of eternal life you are born a human being but after that uh he came in you are born for a purpose not just born amen amen amen it was born uh that was the the purpose and the promise of God because before you were born there was this strip of blood waiting for to take a a body you find women like the Samaritan woman she said I know I know that Messiah coming how do you know because she is part that came like a forerunner you know you were born like a forun to come and Proclaim his name all right so she came like a forun and said I who told her that because before she came already she came from the king's chamber and she came already with a supernatural knowledge and are you here all right and she said I know Messiah coming how do you know amen amen is there somebody who can tell me how did she know that Messiah is coming it is because she was from the Messiah you can't serve somebody whom you have never met amen you came from the Messiah in order to serve the Messiah that's why she said I know mesiah how do you know amen all right amen she couldn't know and left she was from that Messiah you can only serve God or the one that you come from amen because you know him that's why you know how to serve him how to live for him if you know the Messiah then you know for you me to serve the Messiah I must first be cleansed now listen here God's word promised became amen amen all right let me try it again God's word promised not just God's way but the promised one you know people they read even go to Bible school so forth they recite the word but here it says God's word promise now there's a difference between and the word that is Promised amen the word and the word that is sent the word and the word that is God all the people claiming to be preaching the word which because the word that should be preached by the bride of Christ page 244 here tells me God word promised now there just God's word but God's word there's a difference between the word of God and the promised word of God because the promised one has to bring forth something and for the people to say this is that that way that he [Music] promised now God's word promised I quote became blood and it was uh incarnated in the person of Jesus Christ amen when he died uh it was for especially for bleeding because the blood was in that body amen amen now in order to buy you back he had to bleed am amen amen amen the word promised now not just the word the word are you are you there W I can let me hear [Music] you amen not just the way you don't just come to church just to hear the word No it should be the word the promised word amen M amen that's right amen uh there's so many churches right now in here in M amen God's word promised this word became blood let it think a bit the word that amen amen became blood am if it doesn't become blood it is just a way amen but in order to produce to bring about a son or a daughter it has to become amen and was H incarnated in the person of Jesus Christ amen mean the blood we are part of that part of that but it was in this one being the Lord Jesus Christ that was God's Plan of Redemption to put that all of us into [Applause] one and into that man there was [Music] ages amen and the word now now I think can I have a rest rest watch or otherwise the word promised became blood and was incarnated in the person of Jesus Christ the Savior the blood of bulls and goats you know they couldn't save you okay amen now I turn to the smina here uh page 21 you know this every day we are coming to the service but why we should have some other people to go around to monitoring amen amen in heaven you'll never find somebody going around checking whether everyone follows the word no it's only one blood if you see this one here and you look at this one it's one blood so you don't need to examine this one and say I I'll preach it sister H you see what I mean Amen in the church where we are going you won't find some people walking around checking whether one is smoking no we are not going to that place we came from that BL praise God more M amen because if we are the blood of God should we check one another no but if we are not all the blood of God then we need some deons and you know to see that yeah young people live a clean life but yet the deons won't cleans them you know if you see a deacon looking around especially you know young people they just come to church I don't mean all of them but some they come to church they are church goers amen amen now for such people that's why we have deons they call them the policemen now M need some policemen or else you see amen now the bride of Christ don't need amen but if they are mingled then we need police now let me read this uh we we are coming we are still coming we are not through here I'm going to read that even that part of last week here is very very serious the Lord is coming the rupture the Rapture is here amen all right amen now brother if I say the Rapture is here and I see you start trying to quit smoking that mean you are not going in the Rapture the Rapture is not for theok is for the redeemed and he has redeemed you before the foundation of the amen amen amen and you were born here in order to display the sunship okay amen there is no power like the power amen of the watch even naturally you watch the people coming from the same family if they are not safe deemed they become a problem they are a CL you see they become a problem but if the people are born of God Sons and Daughters when they meet they speak about him they are a family a family without God is problem now let's look at this this book Min P 211 and the blood test shows whether you are God's or not now did you hear what it blood test test you know if you are in hospital and then the doctor wants to make some test on you to check where does this sickness originate amen amen we had another one in when you go to he traces is the sickness in your body like if now like if you are here in the Lord but you are Troublesome amen amen when brother are you going to amen h you say when are you going to learn of yours cling walls and things to other people's houses you really people to fight us do you think that cat will hear you and you see it being a saved cat it can't be amen that's why God gave us his own nature because before we were dispatched down to the Earth he tested andiz a young and he said now go for go and serve amen amen but if you find this young man Troublesome he's not from God okay amen all right actually now let's start to look at this things blood test shows whether you are God's or not did you hear it now listen it's not like when they say but are you a child of God say yes I'm a Child of God but but why are you doing this people doing this they're making to do this then you realize uhuh is people I also want to be a child of God you get what I mean amen it means that you you do you believe that a a sheep can tell you I also love to be a sheep it's just the that makes me not let me read you something blood test they don't say to you we want to test you talk speak now do you say that are you going to live right that won't work it should be [Applause] BL am if it's not BL it is impossible amen now it will just be an impersonation and impersonation doesn't last amen uh what do you call this system of watching on the screen for the service and what you call it live live streaming it has caused a lot of impersonation and brother Bram says is dangerous and last we're talking about the pyramid that part then I was with the brother as a witness to that a brother impersonating trying to follow that we are still coming we are not finished with that pyramid I even look for uh a certain pyramid a Book of Enoch because I want the Pyramid of Enoch and my brother I think has found somewhere else where we can get that yeah because why why the pyramid uh let me show you why why and before we come to H something else amen we are at the end of The Journey um okay here is speaks about Enoch I mean zodiac zodia you know with Abraham Abraham it started with zodiac god said look up and tell me if you can tell look up to [Music] zodiac and then the seventh messenger comes H I saw him bringing the Stars this is the prophet of God amen amen H H we'll come to that I've got them lined up zodiac zodia because he says and we say uh it started in zodiac Abraham God said to Abraham look up can you get it brother where is the brother how are youer where is my brother but somebody yes come with it will read it for us let's look at the Zodiac who is going to read for us God said to Abraham okay shall we wait for the brother no let's let's read Genesis 15:5 amen and he brought him forth abroad and said look now towards heaven and tell the Stars if thou be able to number them and he said unto him so shall I it be amen right amen meaning look up to zodiac amen and tell if you can be able all right amen they in the heavens declare the glory of the Lord the heavens declare you know amen the heavens declare the glory of the Lord that's why the mag when they came together in zodiac there was something moving there amen the stars because zodiac what was the first Bible amen zodiac yeah amen so you go back you realize that they followed the Stars the Zodiac and brother B says then God put that zodiac in the pyramid theam amen we are still coming to the a brother was trying to impersonate last week saying pyramid and then it went into the pyramid and I said yeah I was with this brother I wonder if the the brother would be able to follow after he has impersonated what because we are still coming let me say h we we'll come even to this zodiac all right what is zodiac I quote we haven't got time to background yeah something here show how that that pyramid come up through the chambers and so forth it speaks right straight to the end time amen now don't impersonate it goes through the chambers amen Hallelujah you know when the people are in the chamber maybe where the king dwells uhhuh they are in the chamber the real message Believers are actually worshiping in a chamber amen so that's where the king walks around to talk about his kingdom and what what's the future of his kingdom amen amen and in the chamber he is able uh to put each and everyone in his right place now in the chamber if somebody stands up to speak he will speak according to his position amen amen there's no suggestions there each and everyone stands up to say what the King has already yeah in the chamber okay now I read here Enoch we are still coming to that Enoch the seventh man from then we'll come where it says and Enoch walked with God you'll see how the bright is working with God I didn't say the worshippers of M the amen amen amen that's that's why when they say to me brother oh so you fellow there at M Tabernacle we see there's lot of people there yeah and then oh is that where you also Fellowship I will say no I worship in Christ but for a shelter I'm in M for a shelter but as for toship I worshiping Christ amen when I was still living in uh I met two sisters from a certain Pentecostal Church uh we were at the they used to work at the certain shop now why they I entered there because they know me are as you know Sisters in Christ you are always fine then they said by the way brother so so is felling with you I could catch that quickly that because the brother was doing some things outside there now they they have seen him amen amen and I was fortunate Because by the time they asked that question the brother was no longer coming to church and I said uh no uh he used to come to our amen amen but since then I don't know where he is the thing is we saw him doing funny things now they were testing you felling with that man don't rush to say if you are ask a question you fellow brother don't to say yes my brother is my brother no get into trouble oh it's one of you they done they actually saw that brother drunk m M and then now now he would used to go and take few drinks like don't ever no let the word be the defender defend brother if you try and defend a brother know the brother you the on that call the bride and the bridegroom that brother is with you doing all the things the now the answer that I give is that brother brother I see him in church he comes to our but I will never say he's a Christian I'll just say I I usually see him coming to church just coming in there you know drops when it is raining just drops don't just say that's small rain this one is small rain it will pass I'll see you after now if somebody says brother fellow with brother and I I worship God but I saw where we Fellowship so that I I I get out of things now here blood test that is Page 21 choose whether you are God's or not anything that had a beginning an you don't worship God because you are married to a worshiper you only worship God because you are chosen before the foundation of the world by God so you will pass the blood test uh in those days uh for you to find job there was a place there yeah yeah there's a place somewhere close to where if you are a man a young man before you can look for a job I'm talking about a thing that you all know uh we used to go there for some test then then he I remember what they used to do and uh sometimes they would say take off so before you can find any job we were tested somehow somehow I thank God we have passed that area amen M today you can find job without going through that okay now here I will read to you anything that had a [Music] beginning has an end amen if you have started to worship here in M you have an in because a true worshiper they didn't start here true worshiper is a send one coming through the blood line of God have you SE seen the people who came through not the bloodline of the blood line of [Music] God because it says God's word promised became blood amen because it is a promised word for if God can promise you and say h i want you to go to the world and do this and this and this no it won't work like that mm no God's word promised must become blood amen for for us to be standing here today saved it is because the son the promised son became blood you know who is the mother Mary Mary what happened an angel came there and said Mary you are blessed chosen amen amen now that word was only shared to Mary where there is an incubator not Joseph and to show that the Son of God is coming the angel went to Mary not Joseph Joseph was only told about what God has done but for the child to come the angel came to Mary and said blessed you are blessed among women amen amen amen they were special children H Abraham Abraham and Sarah L were well stricken in age old do you know that scripture Mary was old sorry amen but because Sorry God has already [Music] prepared then he said the Bible says they were old but yet the promise of God did not come with the birth dates of Mary and Joseph it was a promise amen he didn't need birth rights and if then you are old according to the nature of this world when he came to to Sarah he had to change him we will soon be changed and amen amen I'm glad God won't take me like this do you think that God can take me I tell God along the road say God wait take it easy because Rapture amen hey the Rapture is [Applause] coming you know you can feel [Applause] yeah the Rapture is coming is just around the cor those that are going in the already there is a big [Music] wheel in them we used to sing that there is a big wheel turning in my heart there is a big will chaining in my heart okay amen uh there's somebody he or she thought that when the Rapture comes like she or he will know then he will move closer to the one she or he thinks that is going in amen amen in order when it started to R yeah she thinks that way in that way amen thinking that some people think that when the Rapture comes I must stand close to somebody who will go in the amen so that when I see him started to yeah there are [Music] people don't to this people you'll just get closer to if possible you'll see when you get there people can be the Rapture it's not something like suddenly is it me is it me Things fall off your pockets it's not something like that the people who will go into the they are already in the [Applause] pyramid we'll come you'll see something here we still coming because the pyramid um as my brother was trying to impersonate now brother Bram says impersonation is don't impersonate okay amen because this Bri the one who will be taken up H more it says here the bride came back we have read that last time because she is Alpha and Omega I will come with this book and next time the Lord will if Hees amen the bride came back because she is Alpha now the Lord Jesus God is Alpha and Omega the bride also is alha and Omega amen married now this is the one he is coming for amen you know the bride came for the first time and for the second amen before closing and then we still going we are still working on something all right amen but now we need a blood test blood test mhm Amen brother sister you need a blood blood test test amen you see me

I do have some people around but they won't bother to come and say they have come to [Music] worship let's finish with this I was trying to read you so you know we have this as you know last time we used this as our amen that was our our title what what the Rock confession of Ages meaning every age the the predestinated they come and confess amen amen for he said Peter means little Stone and where they were standing when he asked them who do men say I the son of man am they were standing at that place where there was cave like opening and writing there was the brother somebody knows it they were standing right there the the gate to help something like that at that place and Jesus said who do do men say I the son of men I have someone who knows it he's just scared to say it in front of people Philippi that's where he came with these disciples a place where they used to make sacrifices there was one day the Greeks a mountain like this some openings there there was this place where there's a writing there says gates To Hell G to did it say so right and when Jesus looked at that just he said who do me say that I the son of man am he tested them the gate there and Peter said thou are the Christ now he didn't say thou are Jesus but he said Christ son of the living and because Peter meaning a little Stone then he said Peter blood and flesh hasn't revealed this to you my father amen the father was involved and Upon This Rock you know God can do things Peter means little [Music] Stone and this little stone is the one that answered the little Stone said to this Rock of Ages th the Christ [Applause] son of the Living God and the main Rock said that rock of EG Peter it was something for Peter a little Stone and the Rock of Ages the Rock of Ages ask a little Stone and this little gave the answer among the 12 apostles thou the Christ he didn't say thou are Jesus no meaning Thou Art the anointing the Christ the anointing and he said by that confession then I I say to you thou art a small rock now a small rock set of the Rock of Ages you know God knew that it's time for that question because there's a rock here a small am now the Rock of Ages ask that small Stone said who do men say that I the son of man am amen and some say this some say that and he said but now who do you say that I the son of man and a small rock said thou are the Christ or maybe you are not listening now it was the Rock of Ages speaking to the Peter the small amen you know there was this let me show you something here amen before it Loose there is this if I can find something here are we together I just want to look at if if not still read it when we come together before the rupture and we still going to that rock we are not through there's something in this book I believe I yeah yeah he says yes this man they ask about a building of a bridge and some couldn't take that job because it was a bridge to cross part of the sea there it's still there that place then uh they said this man when asked if he could take the job he said yes now he had his H uh staff men then he said to them that because others have failed they tried and because it was the sea yeah then this man then said we've got to go to the solid Foundation they tried this and and came be and said it will be difficult for us the place is deep but this one have you heard the prophet talking about this this one said to his help us we've got to go to the solid foundation a real believer he doesn't just stop start he look first for the foundation I was telling the brothers now recently that I was going to attending at the Assemblies [Music] of now I've seen things the people who were supposed to be my uh elders and what they call youth leaders were doing some things so I said oh now but I don't understand these people they stand before us preach I remember one he came with a girlfriend he was married so we were uh close to one another when we were coming after work there after we knocked off he came with a girl smiling say you understand my brother yeah I said understand what he said you'll see it brother we are human that's why you always pray as Mercy from God now because I knew him I said ah well carry on with you but I had one question that the Lord Jesus said I will build my church on this rock and the gates of Hades shall never Prevail I'm telling you the truth before God I said but which church is that because I haven't seen I I I worship at that place at that place but these people are still doing their things our youth leader with running around with girls but when we come together he's the one who stands before us amen amen now I'll be watching him this man then he will start to say thank God bless you sir let me tell you the truth before I decided to stop going to any church with one question the Bible says I I will build my church Upon This Rock and the gates of hes shall never Prevail now I had a question which church is that where is it I've been to churches and I found that ah that one the gates of hell are free to run through it now while pondering asking myself then I'm telling you the truth before God then I have decided to stop going to church to sit back and to say to God I'm waiting for that Church you have promised that the gates of her shall never Prevail over it when I found the spoken word spoken amen am the first one was God of this evil age it was in the hands of a daughter of a pastor [Music] so when I read that I said No this must be that church because I haven't found one amen amen then I but now the very same person who owned that book he was also one of the people but this book God of this evil age God of this evil age after reading it I promise the daughter of that Pastor I'll give it back to you then but go but to God I said I will rest rest at home stop going to any church until you show me or at least you take me to the church you have promised because since I never seen it amen I'm telling you the truth before God while I was pondering when I found that book I read it and I said this should be that one but where because here I've got a booklet so after reading that book I went to that Revival list the father of the girl the girl that who Bor me the book I said where did you get this book so he said no there's a man by the name retif he he's got plenty of this yes that's where it started and so because there were some phone numbers on the back of the book I found brother he said welcome my brother you can come I went to his house the thing started there amen amen now since then even if there is some things similar to those I've seen in denominations there but I said whether there Judah Judas here amen Peter didn't mind whether there is a Judas amen amen but because there's Jesus here amen so Peter followed okay amen things like that now from there I started to see brother he gave me more books and so the H thing started there until today amen's did I open this yeah each one of these ages had that rock confession we haven't finished this one amen we still coming with the pyramid and of this I was saying to a brother this impersonate us they won't follow to the end why let me let me show you something before I close yeah something here amen I want to show show let let me finish this first God's word promise became and was incarnated in the of Jesus Christ the savior because the blood of bus and all [Music] that couldn't bring us to where we are it should be the blood of the Son of God Amen now that blood uh we see that blood again producing Prophet there okay amen now if you say God has sent us well the best word to is to say is God has sent me Elijah the prophet is better than to say God has sent us amen amen maybe I recite in a big group of people but still I will remain like Peter thou now it's me Peter it's Peter not the rest of them no Thou Art the Christ son of the it it was it couldn't take anybody to say to Jesus thou are the Christ am would get amen but Peter being even his name Peter little Jesus knew how to select then until he found P the little Stone because he is the rock of he couldn't deal with water no but it should be St now that's why when he asked he was answered by a stone amen then he ended by saying upon this St Hallelujah I will build my church Peter even when they sacrificed him he said I shall not die like my master he commanded them to do the way he wanted it in closing we are here now each one of these ages no we have read this one I was looking for something otherwise here amen yeah this is the one Amen in zodiac what did it start with we will come with zc the first thing in the zodiac is the vision the last thing in zodiac is Leo the Lion that's the first coming of Christ through the vision the second coming of the tribe of Judah then Enoch completed in his day back in that day the pyramid Enoch the seventh man course then he says uh he haven't got we haven't got time to background it and show how that the pyramid come up through the chambers amen and so forth it speaks right straight to the end time now this is the end time now you'll watch the when we come you watch what is the Pam when I heard that

the pyramid you will understand that things that the public who didn't see and understand are in the pyramid but you need to know what is a pyramid we are coming there with the Pyramid of Enoch the Pyramid of brother these are pyramids amen then when they can't see anything then it was put in the pyramid but as I'm saying you should know what is the pyramid all right amen even at the end of it I'm looking at the clock it say up the six we know we see it but the seven seal is not to the public special it can be seen by those let me stop that for a while until next time last week I think we came here and spoke about on the inside of the pyramid that is Page 75 uh on the inside of the pyramid there was white stone we still coming to them people have been asking about the white St here it is where it is inside the pyramid but the thing is let us come and look at what is this what is the pyramid because at first he said the Seven Seals closes what yeah closes there yes amen now if it is
