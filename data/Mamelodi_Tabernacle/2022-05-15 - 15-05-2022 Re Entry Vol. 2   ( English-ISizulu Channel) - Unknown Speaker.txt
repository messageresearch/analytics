exchange of weights and those people that are selling fruits are also the friend of pastor israel they only respected the driver because of the past but it was going to evolve into a big fight brother bernie my power was able to assist with the situation but it was uncalled but that is not the only incident they are reporting to me that we offload our families while we are parked inside the road that is not good the pasta will not be happy to hear that we are troubling our neighbours you know our neighbors love us so much they respect us if there is anything they call the elders let us treat them with respect let us support them let us greet them let us avoid to engage in fights our transport organizers please speak to the drivers so that they don't offload passengers while they are still in the room we don't just make you turn around the road one of the believers made a u-turn on the sidekick and he was almost involved in an energy on the same thing can we avoid that hallelujah i'm a duke and i'm supposed to say these things you know the deacons are the policemen of the church so it's not nice and that was not the only incident it was another one previous weeks they approached brother p one because one of the brothers parked their car in the wrong place and they wanted to find who and drive ours and it was not nice so let us avoid that hallelujah god bless you can we let

can you introduce that scripture to us genesis chapter 2 verse 8 to 9. and the lord god planted a garden eastward in eden and there he put the man whom he had formed and out of the ground made the lord god to grow every tree that is present to the side and good for food the tree of life also in the midst of the garden and the tree of knowledge of good and evil um our heavenly father here we come this morning to serve the almighty god we know before the foundation of the world we were in your mind as even the prophet has said we were in your mind and then you decided to make a man in of the dust of the earth because man was a spirit when you are a spirit god man was a spirit father this morning we just want to thank you for being your children born into season of the blood of the lord we know your blood is not human blood that's why your blood has the power over satan and his kingdom we know lord god even satan and his agents in these last days they are attending all every service just for to perform but here they are in the wrong place this is the third pool this is the seventh seal the power of god over all the forces of satan we know father they can't receive the word of god because you rejected them from the beginning the prophet says so but we are here just for to worship god and those who have come for something else will get ahead because we are here to worship god and you devil worship us we are here to worship god we know what happened even before you used to come where god is but this is the closing hour and we are here to worship and one day he will take us away in a twinkling of an eye we are glad we are modern conquerors we are here not with in fear of anybody in fear of anything even the underworld we are not in fear of the underworld here you know you devil worship us we are here to worship the almighty god who went to the underworld and took the keys from the devil a false king thank you lord as we open the scriptures your sons
