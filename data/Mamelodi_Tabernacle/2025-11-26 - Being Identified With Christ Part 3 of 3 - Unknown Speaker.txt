TRANSCRIPT
========================================
There is no revelation. There's nothing you can do. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Why? It is because in those days God didn't speak to the Pharisees. &gt;&gt; He would speak in Jesus and whilst they are looking up by the sun and being RAINED UPON. BUT JESUS, GOD WAS ON IT. So if you look up for a long time, you get a bit drowsy. They brought back their eyes. They say, "Don't bring yourself because the word says &gt;&gt; the word was made flesh." And we saw his glory. His glory and dwell among us. GOD WANTED TO TAKE HIMSELF A PICTURE WITH THE people dwelt among us. When you say TO THE MEN, WHERE IS GOD? &gt;&gt; God with us. EMMANUEL. &gt;&gt; EMMANUEL. GOD WITH US. AMEN. &gt;&gt; EMMANUEL, &gt;&gt; God with us. &gt;&gt; You could take a foot with God, &gt;&gt; but he was a man. Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, &gt;&gt; and in those days &gt;&gt; to the Jews, &gt;&gt; they would kick you out of a synagogue. &gt;&gt; If you said Jesus is the Christ, &gt;&gt; they will kick you out of the synagogue. &gt;&gt; If you say the church is Christ, &gt;&gt; they'll kick you out of the synagogue. brother for brother to say &gt;&gt; you are Christ they kick you out of synagogue &gt;&gt; but THAT IS GOD IS GOD SAYING BROTHER IS SAYING WHAT GOD said God doesn't ONLY SAY YOU ARE CHRIST I WILL be in you amen now if he is in you &gt;&gt; it's more than a picture. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; If somebody says um picture &gt;&gt; throw away that picture still the BEST HE HASN'T DONE ANYTHING it's in me. Amen. Amen. Now unbelievers are unbelievers WHO IN THEIR homes &gt;&gt; but actually GREATER PICTURE &gt;&gt; IS in the bride. Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. Amen. We are showing the natural. Amen. &gt;&gt; Which even now I can pose. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; You see &gt;&gt; that one was taken by science. &gt;&gt; IT'S ON THE NATURAL SIDE. &gt;&gt; But the Lord Jesus says at that day &gt;&gt; greater than a scientific picture. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; I love this picture. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now the pro, it is the prophet who saw that picture and and said look at it. &gt;&gt; You see the eyes. Can you see the nose? If you have the color feeling &gt;&gt; and it says because it says it said men as you are gazing in heaven you see him going out up in a cloud. I I he will return just like this. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And Thessalonians says, &gt;&gt; "We that are alive &gt;&gt; shall together be joined to those, &gt;&gt; the resurrected &gt;&gt; in the clouds." Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now before we close, &gt;&gt; now here we are. &gt;&gt; Christ is the mystery of God revealed. &gt;&gt; Christ &gt;&gt; revealed. &gt;&gt; It doesn't say Jesus. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because Jesus is a man. &gt;&gt; Now Christ was in Jesus. Amen. Amen. Amen. Now you come here. E this is the sign of his coming. &gt;&gt; What took place here is there were seven angels. Seven angels came and they they pose a foot with brother Brenham. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They post. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; They put him in the pyramid of themselves. Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, if brother was there, Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. and the prophet is there &gt;&gt; to take a a photo. &gt;&gt; I think he wouldn't say to brotherh, I I won't allow you. I'm coming to something in closing. You listen. The trouble with the people, it's when Christ &gt;&gt; identified himself with the people. Amen. &gt;&gt; That was the trouble of the Jews. Amen. Amen. They wanted a God they could read about, not a manifested one. Because the manifested one is a man. Amen. &gt;&gt; The man, the manifested word &gt;&gt; is a man. Amen. &gt;&gt; The word was made &gt;&gt; flesh. And when when it was made flesh, we &gt;&gt; saw his glory. Amen. &gt;&gt; We saw the glory. When the word was made flesh, &gt;&gt; before the word was made flesh, we could only read. The Samaritan woman, she could only read about it. But when the word was made flesh, she could TALK TO THE WORD. AMEN. AMEN. She could talk to him. Now it was better than just reading because there's no with reading you can ask questions some come up with headaches out with headaches you know really confuses me but &gt;&gt; when he was ON THE SCENE &gt;&gt; the written and women can now put the Bible aside and now said amen. &gt;&gt; You see you can't read while he's here. &gt;&gt; Right. If you are going to Ptoria, &gt;&gt; you've got a map. So you follow GPS. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; GPS. &gt;&gt; GPS. You looking for the chicken, the corner of Victoria Street. Now it brings you there. If we see you looking still searching when you are there we think this person is sick. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You know today we open the books for people and say who are you looking for? &gt;&gt; Jesus. &gt;&gt; Oh here he is. &gt;&gt; Amen. You know, people come there looking. They're looking here. &gt;&gt; But sometimes while still searching, &gt;&gt; now when we find a person who knows the place &gt;&gt; the best. &gt;&gt; So &gt;&gt; it is better when you find somebody, a person, a man who knows the place. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, for you TO GO TO HEAVEN, THE BEST thing if you can find a man who knows WHERE HEAVEN IS. AMEN. &gt;&gt; YEAH. AMEN. &gt;&gt; All right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Because in reading some we understand, some we don't understand. in reading. Don't think that when people read they understand no men they met Jehovah's Jehovah witnesses to them they talking about the godhead now you want to tell that God was in Mary's womb Yes. The driver would close playing games, took his Bible and left. by so doing &gt;&gt; they think they revealing a mystery. &gt;&gt; But the Bible says the son of God. Amen. I tried to show another brother. When they asked him to pray, he said, "Thank you, Father Jesus. Where does the Bible say father? Because Jesus says, &gt;&gt; I go back to my father. &gt;&gt; If you say father Jesus, &gt;&gt; which is the form of the son? &gt;&gt; WHEN HE COMES IN THE FORM OF THE SON, &gt;&gt; he is the son. &gt;&gt; The dispensation of the sunship. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; BUT &gt;&gt; BUT WHEN YOU SAY father &gt;&gt; you mean &gt;&gt; you can't say &gt;&gt; you can't say father Jesus. &gt;&gt; God was not born. &gt;&gt; Amen.

Now you can't say father Jesus you make him a Roman priest Catholic priest let's look at now let's now few minutes let's take a few minutes now I want to know the prophet, &gt;&gt; what does he say &gt;&gt; about Christ and man? &gt;&gt; Because the whole thing is God and men &gt;&gt; because only let us make men &gt;&gt; in our image. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Let us make men in our cood page 13. &gt;&gt; COD page 13 &gt;&gt; paragraph 17. Now if we can find out what God is, we can find what kind of a man he made. Amen. &gt;&gt; Can you accept this picture? Amen. &gt;&gt; When we talking in the natural forms, &gt;&gt; we not only talking about &gt;&gt; I'm talking ABOUT THE PICTURES HERE. AMEN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; The real picture &gt;&gt; is in you. Amen. Now it says, "Now if we can find out what God is or who God is, we can find out what kind of man he has made." That's a nice picture. Amen.

Amen. &gt;&gt; And make him to believe things by his heart through faith. Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. Amen. Now what what what is bothering us if God is something here? &gt;&gt; Let me read something else for you. Um God has always all times reflected himself in a man. That is of a perfect man. Page 14. Amen. The third paragraph here says God dwells in the stature of a man. right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Reflecting himself into that being and he says that's perfect worship. Perfect worship is when YOU SEE GOD in human flesh that is perfect. When God is made known among HUMANS that is and you recognize him like the Samaritan woman, she came to a to perfection when she identified Jesus as the Messiah who came. That is perfect worship. Amen. &gt;&gt; Otherwise, it's entire Christ. Amen. &gt;&gt; It means people WHO REJECT CHRIST WHEN HE'S IN MAN. AMEN. Antichrist and it's called Antichrist. &gt;&gt; They don't believe that God came in a man. That's &gt;&gt; before we baptize. Let's look at this. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Now, here we are. &gt;&gt; The logos. &gt;&gt; This side it says the logos. &gt;&gt; When you look at the logos, &gt;&gt; that is the entire thing. But here you are the manophony. &gt;&gt; So is God and men. Amen. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now you came back. YOU CAME TO FLESH &gt;&gt; and bypass your theophony. You came here to be tested. Amen. Amen. But the seventh seal. Amen. Amen. That's why the seventh seal says silent. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because it is back here. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; The Bible says &gt;&gt; Jesus &gt;&gt; went to the after after &gt;&gt; I thought you listen to God's word. &gt;&gt; Right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now after the resurrection, he went down to the uttermost. Now you read the book of Hebrews, it tells you that in his theophony, he preached to the lost souls in his theophony. Now after the resurrection from the DENOMINATIONALISM in our theophony, we can go to the underworld. Amen. Amen. Take it or leave it. &gt;&gt; Yeah. Hey, we we've got terrible some things to to share. You don't know what's happening. Ask brother, sister, sister. God today can go as far as beyond Peter's BACK to go and pick up something hidden there and bring it to Mia's park. No man can do that. I I don't care what the outside world is saying. I'm talking to you. Amen. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Any other thing is an outsider. &gt;&gt; So I'm not talking to the outsiders. I'm talking to you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; When it comes to marriage and divorce, the prophet said, "This is to my church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Because we are identified &gt;&gt; with the people who believe these things, &gt;&gt; not the outsiders. Yeah. Let's finish &gt;&gt; now. Here you are theopha. &gt;&gt; Now that's why the prophet says God and men were one there. That's where God and man was. That's where the prophet says that's where you were in the beginning. In the beginning was the word. That's right. Amen. So the word in you not the words the word in you means God in you. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's why he is now called Mechisedc because Melkisedc is not the wordsc is the word. So if the word is in you that means HAVING NO FATHER, NO MOTHER, no beginning is in you, no one is going to stop us from preaching what we are preaching. Amen. &gt;&gt; No one. &gt;&gt; Okay. Amen. &gt;&gt; You can gossip the way you want. It won't harm us. Right. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There you are. &gt;&gt; Get up. &gt;&gt; Can you pose yourself yet? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; What would you say? &gt;&gt; Can you pose yourself here? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; If this man If God put this man in the midst of the angels, &gt;&gt; if God uh if if God in Moses opened the the sea, so all Israel appears in the same picture. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now this man says bear with us just a bit. Let's hear how this man disputes people. Amen. Let me find it. Amen. I'll find it quickly. It's right here. Picture 36. &gt;&gt; Christ is the mystery of God revealed. &gt;&gt; His church &gt;&gt; is himself. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Revealed. Amen. &gt;&gt; When he shall appear, &gt;&gt; we shall be When he appear when does he appear? Amen. &gt;&gt; When he shall appear NOW LIKE HIM. I won't have time to read but it says he let me not read he is the seven seals that were revealed right &gt;&gt; then it says &gt;&gt; he revealed the church &gt;&gt; in the same book let me not read the last thing here is his church is himself revealed because he said at that day you shall know that I am in you. So his church, his bride is himself revealed. When the husband takes over the headship and the head and the body is one unit. Amen. Now the people of the world are still trying to separate the head from the BODY &gt;&gt; because they didn't see the head taking over the body. Now it's one unit. Now you brother, &gt;&gt; you can take photo with them. Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Then it will be your photo. &gt;&gt; Nothing to do with me. &gt;&gt; You identify yourself. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All right. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now it is here in the church and the brother has his own in his house together with that one. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now only he has put my head as the head of the church here. But he he can put the entire church there because the high priest the children of Israel according to the thumb they were in the heart of Aaron. Amen.
