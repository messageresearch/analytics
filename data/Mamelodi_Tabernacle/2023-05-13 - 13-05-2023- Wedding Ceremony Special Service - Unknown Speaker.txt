himself my father Dutch Lord he doesn't have no power no authority over these proceedings we just give everything unto thee Lord in the name of our Lord and savior Christ Jesus amen amen [Music] okay we will open the scriptures hmm I will start from Genesis chapter 24.24 verse 1. um Genesis chapter 24 verse 1 to 4. and Abraham was old and well stricken in age and the Lord had blessed Abram in all things and Abraham said unto his eldest servant of his house that ruled over all that he had could I pray thee thy hand under my sign and I will make this way by the Lord the god of Heaven and the god of the earth that thou shall not take a wife unto my son of the daughters of the Canaanites among whom I dwell but thou shall go unto my country and to my Kindred and take a wife unto my son Isaac okay amen you may be seated thank you and thank you okay it's a joyous day it's the ring day I'm the lucky one because I'm going to shake all of you your your hands and then we do more orthodologies whether it is just a marriage oh and God is going to bless all of you whether it's taking drinks or it's a marriage amen and he has predestinated this to be sorry Abraham Abraham said unto his eldest servant of his house right amen the house that rude and over all that he had put I pray thee thy hand oh I mean they swear by the Lord the god of Heaven so you can see that it was a very serious thing here because we believe that marriage came from God is and God will bless us if we do things according to his words oh great I saw Charlie here we are okay Nava we are looking at times because we know that you still have to do some other things after this okay I mean but the what I'm trying to bring you is this he said allow me to repeat this four more country and to my Kindred and take a wife unto my son Isaac is [Music] you shall take it will wait you you take easy to go and do something that is already there and has been planned to be what it is [Music] because you know God has prepared the things God is Not Like Us sometimes we do things that we have not prepared foreign Corinthians okay here it is because it said really when he was confronted with this [Music] the priest said to him a man put away his wife another for any cause what is my brother here do you have your Corinthians there yes okay meanwhile we've seen how Abraham said you know God has prepared things before there was a time when God said let there be lights appeared and first thing he speaks then what follows is a manifestation of his mind yeah because when God speaks the word that is from that is his mind being manifested amen okay amen and as we are here and the weddings are here we believe that money Festival all right yes sir we you know I read this last time it was in God's Minds um what was the scripture says 19. it's Matthew chapter 19. yes take it from verse three the Pharisees also came unto him tempting him and saying unto him is it lawful for a man to put away his wife for every cause and he answered and said unto them have you not read that he wish made them at the beginning made them male and female and said for this cause shall a man live father and mother and shall cleave to his wife and their twin shall be one flesh wherefore they are no more trained but one flesh what therefore God has joined together let no man put a son amen we are thankful amen what God has said joined it together okay amen now let's quickly do it yeah he says those that God has joined together then let no man put Asana that is the real marriage amen is the people that has been put together by God amen amen and uh not bad no no one can yeah but those that have after God planned marriage that a man shall leave his father and mother foreign [Music] Adam crawl was created he was not born that's why um after the birth of death you more and again of the spirit Born Again of God okay amen all right now now we're watching here we foreign [Music] [Music] of marriage even the military was confronted now when Moses was confronted he allowed them and gave them now when Jesus Christ came from the beginning it was not so [Music] [Music] does not require Moses in there [Music] [Music] that is why things are not the way God had put them to be okay amen marriage is no longer the same as the way God okay yeah very very I you know you know marriage was never right [Applause] and then I saw joining it says uh we we have two thoughts of this marriage and divorce uh now that God lord has opened the Seven Seas amen his word to us in this last days [Applause] there's seven openings that's when God took everything back to him as he opened the seals from the beginning it was not like it is [Applause] is the beginning of the word of God Amen that is what the Lord Jesus spoke of this is foreign [Applause] [Music] comes under the Open Cities you can't get any marriage [Music] amen amen so the reasons [Applause] we have entered the before beginning of God you know if you if each and every one of us the Bible says let the mind in Christ and that's when God was saying things can be well only fell in the mind help people that was in Christ is in you amen a person who is getting married he or she can go back to the mind of God he must be married amen amen then things will be well praise God he said let their mind that was in Christina [Music] um what was it foreign Christ [Music] yes sir because um I worked with somebody else do you have ancestors I said no but you know that I'm a Christian how can I have ancestors I have God [Music] in the beginning I mean in the beginning it doesn't have much because anything any sitting in the beginning even before the eyes of God he doesn't even it doesn't exist from the beginning [Music] [Applause] that before I do something I must go back or level in the beginning was the worse [Music] [Music] and how did The Wedding Marriage comes from the beginning from the beginning if we could take things from the beginning it was not so the scripture says from there from the beginning it was not so right amen and he answered and said unto them have you not read that he which made them at the beginning made them male and female amen from the beginning the Lord Jesus Moses because of the happiness of yours in the beginning they said unto him why did Moses then command to give a writing of divorcement and to put her away he said unto them Moses because of the happiness of your heart suffered you to put away your wives but from the beginning it was not so amen right amen you see now yeah [Music] um we would be in a better position from the beginning is you were given the letter by the prophet Moses it is not so with God you got that from because from the beginning now you know if we can say how do we get to the beginning and came to us and said yeah amen meaning amen amen everything you are looking for the Bible says [Music] [Music] in the beginning was life in the beginning one [Music] that's where things started [Music] and we are going to enjoy that's why the people today now if you look uh the film stars when they marry [Music] I like it the Bible says more Genesis in the Book of Genesis okay chapter five verse 1. chapter 5 verse one and two yeah this is the book of the generations of Adam in the day that God created men in the likeness of God made he him male and female created he them and blessed them and call their name Adam okay call their names they were called Adam and then using Adam and Eve they will call Adam Genesis 3 20. when you read it is amen Adam and Eve okay so we are thankful that's why Abraham is [Music] a wife massage for my foreign you know and when they met at the well yeah because how God made things when they met um because the Bible says he prayed because the right one asking God to give him the right woman I mean you know amen Yari he didn't say give me the one who is like this like this he's just a character to God to give him a woman with the right character amen amen among women now here comes a woman among women and then she said give me he says and your camels you see amen she started savings then we are done with Genesis and she said the
