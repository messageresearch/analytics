Gracious heavenly father. Amen. You are the one Lord Almighty that has created heaven and earth. And you are the one Lord Almighty that processed us from uh the bosom of your uh heart. And father processing heart knowing that you have a special food for us of which Lord you are the one that will you'll feed us with that food. So we are gathered here Lord according to the promise you said you'll build up your church and here is your church that you have done and father you are the one that is protecting it so that the gates of hell should not prevail against it and father you are also the one that anoints your church amen and reveal yourself Lord unto your church. Hallelujah. So you will never you said with your own mouth Lord that you will always be with us. Amen. And you said you will never forsake us. That is why father we are gathered in this way. Amen. Knowing that father there is an anointing in this tabernacle. Hallelujah. And knowing that there's a guidance in this tabernacle. Amen. And also knowing that now uh we are standing here behind the pull pit where the angel of the church always stand. Father may that very same anointing that you gave that angel yes be upon us Lord as we are going to proclaim your word. Thank you father. May your uh the believers that are sitting down there be also engaged Lord with that very same angel. Thank you father for we know that you descended and we know that father you are preparing us for a rapture and you are giving us father the fruits of the land and father we benefit from that fruit of the land. Thank you, Father. Bless each and everyone that is here, Lord, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ and the word that we're going to preach. You'll be the one, Lord Almighty, that will bring it forth. Amen. In Jesus Christ, my Lord. Amen. Amen. Okay. God bless you. So, uh, I'm going to surprise you reading a verse that is well known to you. But it's for a [Music] purpose. Let's read Malachi chapter 4. 4 verse 5 and 6. Verse 5. Malachi chapter 4 from verse 5-6. Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord. And he shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children. Amen. and the heart of the children to their fathers, lest I come and smite the earth with a case. Amen. You may be seated. God bless you. You I know you are familiar with this verse. You sing it every day. But you know that if I can round you up one by one. Some of you may not explain that. I always say when I preach, if it was at school, I would say those that understand it, raise your hand. But you are here to hear the word of God, not to raise your hand. Okay? The Bible says here, "Behold, I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord. So my title will be that one, the great and dreadful day of the [Music] Lord because it says he will send that prophet before that day. What I want you to notice is this. It says uh and he shall turn [Music] the heart not the hearts says the heart of the fathers. Fathers is in plural and heart is a singular. Why is it like that? And it goes on and says and the heart of the children to their fathers and the heart there It's a singular but the children is not singular. So let me explain why is it like that. You see uh one day the pastor stood here and then he spoke about the pyramid pyramid and he spoke about the blood. So he didn't say the blood. No says the blood. You still remember that day. He said you are the blood. Remember the the the the Holy Ghost or the example that our Lord Jesus Christ gave. He said he took the bread and said eat this is my flesh. and took the wine and said, "Drink. This is my blood." And then he was accused for says now he's a vampire. He wants people to eat his flesh and drink his and drink his blood. So you know that when he was put in the grave, his body was in the grave, there were soldiers that were guiding them, right? Amen. But those soldiers didn't see him resurrected. So now they were supposed to be punished because they were guarding the throne. They should tell what happened. Instead they were bribed that they should say he said they must eat his flesh. So they came at night and took the body and they ate his flesh. Instead of punishing them, they bribe them that they should say that it is because the supernatural happened. There was a resurrection and the resurrection has to do with the quickening of the body. Now I think The pastor has given us all that we need. Amen. He has gone through the Bible from Genesis up to the book of Revelation. What we're doing now, uh, it's just clearing up here and there. But there's nothing that you don't know. Amen. God is the one that gives you revelation, right? Amen. So at times he will stand here and start crying. I don't know how many of you recognize why he is crying. And then how many times did he say my to those that want to make it It is because when he is studying, God shows him. And now the word of God must manifest itself to an individual. [Music] It's not that it's not something that you will explain and somebody understand our Lord Jesus Christ. There will be people that follows him and then he will teach them in parables. And then at night when he is with his disciples then the the sermon that he preached during the day will be explained. No. Until they asked him, why is it like that? He said to them, "It's because you are chosen. Those people, they see but they can't see. And they hear but they cannot understand." The word of the Lord, the revelation of the word is to those who are part of it. Now what has happened now? There are those things actually I said uh my title no my title is not the one that I gave you. My title is the great tribulation after the rapture. I'm sorry about it. After the rapture there will be great tribulation. So, we'll touch on those, but what I wanted to say is just we're just iring up are we together, right? There are before we go to uh the things that will happen after the rapture, let's uh bring what you call the things that happened before the rapture. so that you you could have an idea of what we will be talking about. Now, I've got a slide that says the great tribulation after the rapture one them. Yeah. No, not that one. Not that one. Yeah. Yeah. That's the one. Yes. Look at that that that that uh slide. It's it shows the Jew dispensation and the gentile dispensation. Amen. Right. Let's go to the Jew dispensation. [Music] It speaks about Elijah the prophet which is John who turn the heart. Oh, let me explain the issue of a heart. They believed in in in the in the in the in the law of Moses. In that law of Moses, they were one heart. And if you come to the the the other Elijah this side speaking about the Gentiles, the church, the bride is one heart. You are yes individuals. Amen. But as individuals, the ministry of the seven gives you a revelation and then it makes you a bride. What is in me is in brother and what is in me and brother is in you here. The word makes us a family and the family is one heart. All of us we become one thing. Apart from that we will be fooling ourselves. If there is a difference between me and claiming that my body one day will will will change. what is supposed to change my body is the word. Now the word that is in him and is the word that is in me. The word does not differ. It makes us one. All right. Now let's go to the to the slide itself. The Jews believe the law of Moses. And when John came was to change that because the Messiah was coming. So it was for running the Messiah as you can see. So their heart must change to the it must turn to the the new ministry so that they could receive the Messiah. That is why he was baptizing. When he sees that your heart has turned from your fathers. Then he gives you I mean he baptize you then we are ready now waiting for the Messiah. When the Messiah comes, he's just going to point him and you will believe because you'll be waiting for the Messiah. And then when he says there's the Messiah, then you need to follow the Messiah. That that is all. Should you have any question, he points you to the Messiah. [Applause] His ministry was he was in prison. They went to him and say that man you said is a messiah is baptizing. He said it's none of my business. go and ask him because it should be a revelation and when they went to Jesus and say h we are from John we don't understand what's going on you're confusing us he never says sit down brothers let me explain you know But again, and that messiah that you definitely sure I'm telling you the truth. No. Uhuh. He said, "Were you in the river Jordan? Were you there?" They said, "Yes." Said, "What did you see? Did you see the reads blown by the wind? You see he's not he says now there's no one like John the prophets. There's no one that has pointed the Messiah with his finger. He just left them there because that was for specific people. That is why he never sat down and preached to Peter. No, he said follow me. Amen. Right. Amen. He called him from another dimension and is speaking from another Amen. body look the Bible says the Lord says behold I create a new earth. and a new heaven. See what he says. Now when he brings the new earth, a new heaven, he cannot take this old body and took it to the new earth, a new heaven. So he must create a new body for that new earth and that new heaven. Amen. Right. Amen. So that is why now this body must change. Right. Amen. So the ministry of the seven has to do with the changing of people. That should be your dream. That should be your meditation of changing your body. Right. Amen. All right. Let's go back uh uh to that to that to that to that. Now you see there is a line that that that divides the Jews and the Gentiles. Right. Amen. Okay. You've already understand that. Now turn the heart of the father from the law of Moses to that one of the Messiah. Right. Amen. And thereafter, let's leave it like that. We start with Pentecost. Now, on the Gentiles. Remember, it went on and on from all the seven church ages. Right at the end, God raised a prophet that is brother Brenham. Brother Bren. Now his ministry, he will start first to turn the heart of the children which is ourself to our fathers. Who are the fathers? The apostles back to the foundation. Then after back to the foundation, then when we are settled now, right at the foundation, doing things every the right way. Look, the prophet says uh Luther preached in this book standing in the gap in paragraph 76. Paragraph 76. Luther preached. Luther justification, but he let it run wild because he didn't live long enough. So he left it halfway. Then they organized and then he says Luther never organized. But they organized and then Wesley came. After Wesley, they got the Wesleyan churches and then after that came John Smith, the Baptist, Alexander Cable, Alexander and so forth. But the men, the reformers, the reformers didn't live long enough to get it all together. You see? Amen. So there was a gap that they could not bring the church together from Luther up up up to John Wesley. They could not bring it together. They let it loose. But the reformers didn't live long enough to get it all together and saw a lot of loose ends. Right. Amen. And then when sorry and then when they did for instance of the water baptism that John Smith brought back by immensing but using wrong titles. Those are the loose ends. Right. Amen. And then when we come down to the end, the last message supposed to straighten that all up. bring these things to one faith, one Lord, one baptism, right? Amen. Then there's the important one. Then you notice it's open up the top of the pyramid. It it it can't be kept. with loose ends. That is why the pyramid pyramid uh the church ages during the church ages the pyramid was not kept because it has loosed [Music] ends. Then men who teach that pyramid doctrine, I guess they know what they're talking about. So any man that will teach about the pyramid doctrine pyramid, he knows what he's talking about. Because it won't be a man. It will be God himself teach that pyramid doctrine. That pyramid doctrine it comes down from eternity. the seventh angel and the one that will receive that doctrine. It's not from here. [Applause] So when there's angels came, they came with their own stuff. They came with their the people that will understand. When brother Brennan Brother was in the sixth dimension, he said, "Where's Paul?" They says, "No, Paul is in another level." And then they say, "And then Brenham said, I've taught exactly what Paul said." I said, "No, we're waiting upon that." That that were called his people in the sixth dimension, he had his his people, right? Amen. So now if in the sixth dimension, sixth dimension he had his people. now hear the ministry for his people. And then I once read you a scripture that speaks about uh the one that look after your soul. There's somebody that looks after your soul. Now this thing now they've got different levels. See? Amen. You are part of brother Brennham. Yeah, brother. Amen. You are part of that angel. You are part of your pastor. We are all sheep. It's it's in that lineage. You can't change it. Amen. Now what he says the men who teach that pyramid doctrine I guess they know what they are talking [Music] about. Then he says I know nothing about it. Now who taught us the pyramid? He went he went he went west to west to connect to the man right and when he came back he was another man taught the pyramid doctor amen right but he says I know now there's a part of you that knows nothing but there's a part of you that knows. Amen. That is why you are sitting here what brought you here is a part of you that knows. [Applause] Now the people that are not listening this morning or that are not live streaming this morning, they they can't be part of this. When that time comes, your part draws you to the other part. Are you together? And uh when uh uh uh uh the word is is is processed it it's the different parts communing. That is why now okay let's move on. However, but but however, it was the shape of a pyramid. But the cap on the pyramid was never put on as long as there still loopholes. The cap never came on because it was a cornerstone. It was a headstone in the church. It was a cornerstone. In the full church, it was a capstone cornerstone became the capstone. Amen. So it never came to the Jews. It was rejected. Amen. He came he he went to the Jews as the son of man and he was rejected. So the Jewish church had no capstone. That is why the capstone to the Jews will come after the rapture. The rejected cornerstone the Jews you will see him in the book of Zechariah. Right. Amen. Now before now we see uh the great tribulation after rapture. Those are the things that we need to understand. First turn their heart and then when you are settled then you get all the spiritual ingredients. Uh let's go to that very same uh what you call that that that that uh slide uh slide. Yeah. You see it says the title is the great tribulation after the rapture. So in order that there should be a rapture, there should be a ministry that will give you a rapturing faith. Right? Amen. There should be a ministry that will give you a rapturing faith. Right. Amen. Now, after the rapture, then it is the bride. That's why we say we're polishing it up. You know about it. Now it is the work and the commission of God to the pastors that they make sure that the bride will be raptured. It's not an issue is to give you what belongs to you. Right. Amen. And what belongs to you, it will work on itself. It's like when you've got a headache, you take maybe discipline or that discipline will work on it. You must receive it. So there is a ministry that will give That is what now the pastor is doing now. He has done everything. He went even beyond and touched the book of Enoch, right? Amen. Which is not in the Bible, but he will tell you that it's in the pyramid. It's in the zodiac. And it was before even Job. You see now? Amen. Now everything has been covered up. What we're doing is just ironing it up so that when you you miss it. Uh no miss it. when you miss it, it will be your fault. And then so that now you know it's it's it's the Bible says you will be judging your own sister, your own brother, your own cousin. You'll be taking your own sister to the lake of fire to show you that is not your sister. The real sister is this one that the other one is not your brother. You share the bloodiest but your reality is the eternal one. I don't say you must hate each other. Here on earth is your brother. Yes. Yes. But beyond uh that is why you need to cry for your brother right now. You need to cry for your relative right now. What will happen after rapture? There's no turning back. Right. Amen. So we're talking about after rapture is what what will happen after but we should know where is our ministry. Remember that now he came our ministry is the ministry of the son of man. He is now a son of man. And when God said to Ezekiel, "Son of man, what is the son of man?" It's God in a man. So our ministry is that of God in a man. But in our case, it's it's it's a revealed word like like what the Bible says in the book of John chapter 10 verse 35. Just just just let's go there. John 10:35. John 10:35. Amen. Now that that's where our ministry is. The their ministry, Jewish ministry was a man that you could point with a finger. Our ministry is the word that is in the man. Listen to what he says. If he called them gods, unto whom the word of God came and the scripture cannot be broken, if the word of God, now the ministry is of a son of man is the word that came unto you. In the beginning was the word. The word was with God. The word is God. The word was God. Are you together? Now if that the word that was that was God come to you, it make you a God. That is why that word came to Mary. When it it reaches the womb of man, it created a body of God. That is why God Bible says he's a spirit. He's a logos. But God has got a body. That is why the Bible says that very same Jesus, the very same Jesus, God has made him the Lord and Christ. So the day you meet him, you meet him in that body because he resurrected in in that body. Are we together? Now, if the word comes unto you and reveals itself unto you, it forms God. Right. Amen. Look, if you call them God, small G, unto whom the word of God, capital G, the scripture cannot be broken. Right? Amen. Remember the ministry of the son of man contain the opening of the seven semen. Right. Amen. The ministry of the seven se contained or or or the ministry of the son of man contains the opening of the seven. Amen. Amen. Now the third pool is the manifestation of the end time. When you when you when when you talk about the third pool, you talk about the manifested way, there's a promise, that word when is manifested, it's a third pool. So when you manifest the third pool is the word that you are promised being manifested. Amen. Right. Amen. If you check the Messiah during the the the the the Jews dispensation, you'll see what happened. During the time of the Messiah, the time of Jewish dispensation, uh, King Herod and and Pilot, Herod was the king of the Jews and that that is Herod and Pilot was the governor. They didn't they were not friends. They hated each other. But because of our Lord Jesus Christ, they joined hands. They became friends because of our Lord. Because they wanted to fight him. Look at what is going on in our time. Look at the churches. They have joined hands against the revealed [Applause] word. It it is very difficult to present the word at its standard. at any other church. You can't do that because it separates it. It it it even separates [Music] families. You know Jesus was separated from his own brothers. They will say to him, "Go and show yourself." But they they were saying, "Go so that they can kill you." You must read it. It says, "So, so they were separated." So the word of God when it is manifesting itself it cause separation because the things that are here are not exactly what God has ordained to be like that together. And you you you need to check the history and check what is happening uh when the word is manifested. You see when the word is manifested, it bends those that don't believe in it. and and and it exposed it exposed everybody that is against the true will at the end. It expose liars. It expose witches. It it it expose everything because it's light. So there's nothing that you you will hide regardless of what you are doing. You can't hide yourself from this. It's a lie and and everything that was not created by God. You know the prophet says there are things that crept at night and they bite people with those things. I don't know them in English. All those Yeah. I don't know in English my Yeah. They they creep up at night. He says no. They were not created by God. Why are they sucking blood? See, so they exposed. The prophet came and exposed. This does not come from [Applause] God like the trees that they've got thorns. He says, "No, they were not created. Devil is not a creator. Right. Amen. What he do? He take what you when God kicked him out of heaven. Remember God has gift gave him gifts. Great gifts. The devil had grieve. Like the singers here. They've got an organ. You've got the saxophone, saxophone, guitar, drums with the devil. It was all in him. All the whole symphony. And God never said, "No, because I'm chasing you out. Bring my things." He gave it to him. That is why is a musician must be very very very careful because the devil has got all those things. I was reading about John Todd. He was a a Jew a devil worshipper. He says most of the singers, they've just got the voice but they can't compose. So he said he gave an example about Carol King. those that knows Carol King, she's got a beautiful voice, wonderful melody, but you can't compose a song. So, witches composes a song in a witch language. When you read it, you read nice words. When you reverse it, it's a witch language. Then he says, you take that thing, you put it in your house, it causes a revolution in your [Music] house. It makes your children mad when it's playing. Uh the father will get mad at the children. and the mother will do funny things and the children because of that wi-i without even playing it just having the disc of that thing I'm just showing you that now God didn't take the gift of the devil he knew that He was going to make you God, let alone the gift. You will be God. So the devil cannot manipulate. The devil can never manipulate. He say, "Take the gifts, but these are my children. I'll give them off myself. So you become God. Amen. When when when Abraham Abraham was about to depart, he called Isaac and he called Ishmael. Those were his sons. So he gave gifts to Ishmael. riches and everything and gave Isaac all everything all. The other one is very rich. But Isaac has got all that's what God do. He gave us all of himself. When when he met Abraham, he didn't give him things bits and pieces. No, he gave him God. Amen. Now, that's what he did to his bride. He gave of himself. Remember, I haven't even touched what will happen after rapture. I just want to show you how important are you and how powerful are you and and you must never allow the devil to us what God has given you. It's yours. You must know that it's yours. and you must admonish it. The ministry of the seven seed, it makes you God. Just just imagine. Now you I was thinking about the new Jerusalem. uh one one of the you know these these children that are sitting here don't think that they don't hear one of them said to me teach me about an angel or about angels I said why said no you No, I don't want to uh doubt the angel when it comes to me and say who are you? I want to know the angel. Now the thing is in the supernatural it says uh in New Jerusalem you will travel like like your mind I just imagine when I want to visit our Lord Jesus Christ. I'm going to take Uber. No, I just think about him and then he'll be here. And when he wants me, he just think about me and then I'll be there. In the garden of Eden, when God was visiting Adam, he didn't come flying. No, Adam just saw him there and then and then they they commune. Can you gamble with such a life? where you will you if you want to go to any planet in the universe you are just there by thinking about no now can you uh waste your time where now you don't have to use Uber or retakes fine that's what is it Amen. Okay. Now, that's that's that that's where God wants us to be, taking us up to those type of dimensions. So, that is the don't take this ministry lightly. It's it's it's it's it's of his own. when when when Herod came together, it was because the great one was here. And when you see the world forming, they come together. You must know that the great ones, history, history and prophecies are being fulfilled. Now what is happening in the world? The superior general of the society of Jesus is now taking control. the general of the of the of the the Jesuits, if you don't know, is taking control. You saw the pope opening the doors? Why was he opening the door? And how many doors did he open? And he never closed those doors. The other popes open the doors and close them. This one hasn't closed. Ask yourself and ask yourself, what are those doors? Why why is it why is he opening the door right? Amen. Now you compare that with the river Euphrates. You compare that with a superior general and you compare that with this book here, Acts of the Holy Ghost, paragraph 87. Paragraph 87 that was preached in 1954 1954. There's a prophecy there that speaks about that. You'll go and read it. I'm not going to tell you. Go and read it. Remember the devil came as an antichrist. Then he became a false prophet. I think I heard that that that slide. If you've got can can you can you display that slide where now he he he not that one where he is an antichrist a false prophet a v a beast you see amen remember now that after a rapture that beast will take control. Now he has he has formed that thing. It's it's one and the same thing. Then from when when you see him mobilizing the whole world, you must know that there's a great one that is standing by. There's a great one that mobilize from eternity. The devil will mobilize from the world. Oh, it will mobilize. So, remember there's what we called the investigating judgment angels. Now, brother Brenman spoke about wormwood. He said wood is in control of the waters. I said to you, we're just polishing up is in control of the water. He's the one that destroyed the whole world during the time of Noah. Look at what is happening now about the fires, about the waters. The investigating judgment angel is all these years we never had such fire. All these years we never had a nature that is struggling. Right now there's something that's happening in the nature. It shows you that now even what God has created it's performing. This is not how God put me to be. Everybody takes his own direction. He's pulled from where he he is established. Right? Amen. So now you you will you will read that that quote. But now let me just jump a little bit. Remember that. Now We spoke about behold I'll send you Elijah the prophet. Now we are gathered together. And after we gathered together the voice of our Lord the voice if you look at those spoken words we are we are having it's muted but in the days of the voice Right. Amen. And the prophet says is the same voice that raised Lazarus. There's life in that voice. He said in John 663, I love that scripture. The words that I speak, they are spirit and they are right. Amen. So the prophet says is the same voice that raised Lazarus. Right. Amen. Now uh the pyramid pyramid has reached a point where it should quicken. There's relevant things that are happening. Now when I'm talking about relevant things about the things that has to do with the time you they are relevant. that that I happen and the first thing is the manifestation of the word. The second thing is the manifestation of the promises. Remember the word of the Lord is here to give us a divine nature according to uh the second book of Peter. Verse four says, "Now God gave us promises that will give us a divine nature. Our nature has changed to that of a divine right. Amen. You you you watch the behavior of the people. It's either they are extremists on the on the negative or extremist on the positive. There's nothing that they can do. It's how they are. When our Lord Jesus Christ was was about to be crucified, you look at the reaction. You look at the spirit of that time. He will say, "Tonight is the night." You will be disappointed and look at their reaction. Look at Peter. You look at the other disciples. Then you will see whether they look Peter said, "Thou art the Christ, the son of the living God." God gave him a key. Right? He gave him a key. Immediately he received that key. The angel of the devil was upon him until Jesus Christ says, "Get thee behind me. You when he was uh he when when when they were taking communion, look at the reaction of of Judas. He was shivering because the time has come that he should fulfill who he was. Look at the time that you are living in. You see people shivering. The time has come. You know Judas was aware that I've got funny anointing. And look at our Lord Jesus Christ. He was relaxed. He said, "I have appointed you and I have chosen you being 12, but one of you and the one of you knew was pointing at me." He was shivering spiritually and the devil was looking at his position. Now he's about to descend. That's why I'm quoting the generals of the Jesuits. That's why I'm quoting what the the world is doing now. You look at the World Council of Jesus. You look at the United Nations. You look at what whatever is happening. You look at the man when when when the rapture come go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go go goes up the devil will be descended look at at that man who the devil will will descend on you I don't want to call names but I've quoted names but if if you are spiritual you will know exactly where the devil [Music] And look at the reaction there. Are we together? Right. Quickly now I've got about 15 minutes. Let's let's save that. H let's display that in uh yeah that is the that's the one. Okay. After the rapture. Now I've I've already spoke about things before the rapture. Now the Bible it speaks about Gog and that is in Ezekiel 38. What will happen there? We'll just give a brief explanation and then read some few scriptures. Now what is happening now? Gork, you must go and check who in Genesis chapter 10, you'll find all those names. Now Gog, okay, Noah. Noah after uh after God destroyed the world, I mean the the the the Yeah. the the the the earth with water. It was Noah that was it was Noah his three sons and their wives people eight people were were left it was him and Jafet right now and Jaff they started spreading with their families In the olden days, uh people were uh the names of the tribes comes from the great grandfather and even places. You will read in in Genesis 10is that now Gog was a name of one of the children of the grandchildren of Noah. As they move on, they found a place. That's why the Bible says go and it speaks about the prince of the land. When you I've I've displayed a lot of of of slides there. One day I I remember showing you that Russia Russia is called Gog. that Moscow is called Mish it used to be and that is why the prophet said watch Russia king of the north that is what the prophet said it's not me got quotes I can show you because of time he said watch Russia king of the north and then if you want to Check what is going on in the Vatican. Check what is going on in Russia. Check what is going on in America because there's a prophet from uh the prophet. Even the code that I've just given you, it's it's it's a code that it's a prophecy that was prophesy in 1954. Okay. But now you all know that uh Gog and Mog of Ezekiel Ezekiel 38 38 speaks about the kings of the east will be attacking Israel. You know the commotion now is you go look at the east look what is going on. I I I don't want to quote countries but they are there you can see them that now there is a commotion there is there's a war there's fighting why what are they fighting for they are fighting for uh there's a city called Jerusalem that's where Abraham Abraham met that's where now new Jerusalem when it descends it will land there. Now new Jerusalem is not a city like Pritori. No no there won't be any sea. The Bible says see it will stretch. Just just just to give you an example one side could stretch from me to right at Cape Town right in the Atlantic Ocean one side only then make that thing square that that that will be the sea right. Amen. But the headquarters, the headquarters will be God himself. No more light. There's quite a lot of things. Amen. Are we together? Amen. Now what they are fighting for is that now when he descends, he will come there. So they want to occupy that place. There was a time where they were even making a me missile. say no when when when Jesus come coming with a child they're going to shoot him. Now it's it's on the super Luke. We say it's the end of time. Now end of time is that now the time will end. Now starts another another to start another dispensation. Now in that dispensation it will be the devil that is ruling this so-called world. the devil himself will be the one that is in control there only one ruler and then that's why now your your your your way of worship it should be you should be worshiping the devil there's no Holy Ghost what what what what what gives us power is that when we pray, we feel the anointing and and when we read the Bible, we feel the anointing and then the Bible says, he he brings the the the the understanding in in Ephesians 1:17, he give us a spirit that we should understand and should we have knowledge, but After this, no anointing, no revelation, no power, no Holy Ghost. You just try to read and you are not even allowed to read. Are we together? Amen. Those are the things that will be h happening during that time. I haven't touched them. We've got only 5 minutes. But the Lord willing, one day the pastor might touch them or I can touch them. But let's go to that one just so that you could go through. I've got five minutes to go. You see there's a time when there will be the war and I've just I was just reading it. the time does not allow me. God will attack Russia and then God says I will defend them defend. That's what he says. He says I I myself. I will I will defend them. Right. Amen. He says uh they shall come from thy place out of the uh the north parts and then it says it shall be in I don't want to give you the verses because it will it shall be in the latter days. Now the latter days the final period before the end. Amen. Are we are we are we together? Oh maybe if you want to display it my brother display verse 16. Verse 16. Verse 16. You see what it says here and verse 16. And it shall be in the latter days. Vers 17. Verse 17. The last part it says, I'll bring thee against them. You go. I will bring you and more. Verse 18. Verse 18. The last words there h it says that my fury shall come upon in my face. Verse 19. Verse 19, it says the last words. Surely in that day there shall be a great shaking in the in the land of Israel. Let's go back to the slide again. So then thereafter uh before actually then comes the the time of tribulation where John where Elijah and Moses will be preaching. Remember we said eh the the the the [Music] the pyramid of the Jews was not kept. So now John and Moses will bring this very same ministry but they will start from Pentecost on and on on the capstone. When they are finished, there's a scripture in in Revelation chapter 11, they will be killed, laid for 12 days, I mean for three days and that that very same voice that raised Lazarus will call them out. When you call them up and then they will resurrect when they were dead. people will be uh very very happy because they hated them but they will call them then after he called them they will preach and then 144 I'm I'm just rushing would see them but the verse that I want us to read it's in Zechariah Zechariah chapter 12 that's my last verse Zechariah 12 after they were called and after the 144 144,000 has repented go to Zechariah chapter uh 12 Zechariah 12 Zechariah 12 verse 10 let's read it in truth You got it. Start from verse 10. Zechariah 12 from verse 10. And I will pour upon the house of David and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the spirit of grace and of supplications. And they shall look upon me whom they have pierced. And they shall mourn for him as one mourneth for his only son, and shall be in bitterness for him, as one that is in bitterness for his firstborn. Amen. 11. In that day shall there be a great mourning in Jerusalem, as the morning of Hard Rimmon, in the valley of Megiddon. And the land shall mourn, every family apart, the family of the house of David apart, and their wives apart. The family of the house of Nathan apart, and their wives apart. Yeah. 13. Just read up to 14. The family of the house of Levy apart and their wives apart. The family of Sheiml apart and their wives apart. All the families that remain every family apart and their wives apart. Amen. So yeah, one day we will explain it in full. That is just to say to you, get up your loins and know that you've got greater things that end. And if you fail and busy playing about know what are the consequences, make sure that you are serious in the word of God and you understand and you've got the revelation and uh you are aware that you are going and if you are not sure God bless you. [Applause] Amen. There's a song that says going home and I'm going home. Can can can you sing it for us? [Music] Amen. Amen. [Music] [Music] I caught limbs of the day. Praise God. I am [Music] good.

I'm going to ask to come forth just to say a word of prayer. As we continue with the same [Music] song I am going home [Music] to hold [Music] me in peace. All that he can praise God for my [Music] glory. Okay, we can just say thank you Lord. The dangerous time is when God is silence. [Applause] It is finished. Just waiting waiting for the rapture. Our elder has preached. Father God after tribulation is so angry. from this ministry to stop them. because they've got power inside. Because when you said greater is he that is in me than the one who is in the world, that greater one is pulling your children. They've got an an unstoppable engine inside them. Soon and very [Music] soon the devil won't know where does that power come [Music] from herself It is finished. Bless our elder. We [Applause] believe it's just a fire only. Amen. [Applause] You may take your seats. Turn to your neighbor and say, "God bless you." Amen. Amen. My brother, there's a song I want you to sing.
